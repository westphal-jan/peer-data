Typically, agents (or voters) express their preferences over alternatives (or candidates). There are many different models for the expression of preferences, ranging from the simplistic (each voter provides his or her favorite choice, also known as plurality voting) to the comprehensive (each voter provides a complete ranking over the set of all candidates). Approval ballots are an intermediate model, where a voter approves or disapproves of each candidate \u2014 thus a vote may be thought of as a subset of approved candidates or as a binary string indexed by the candidate set. Approval votes are considered as a good compromise between the extreme models \u2014 they provide the agent an opportunity to make a comment about every candidate, without incurring the overhead of determining a full ranking on the candidate set [Fishburn, 1978, Brams, 2008, Kilgour, 2010, Lepelley, 2013, Baumeister et al., 2010].\nOur work in this paper focuses on finding the \u201cbest\u201d subset of k candidates when given n approval votes over m candidates. The set of candidates together with all the votes is usually called an election instance or simply an election. We use the term electorate to refer to the set of votes of all the agents, and the term committee to refer to a subset of k candidates. Since a committee is a subset of candidates, and a vote can\nalso be interpreted as a subset of the candidate set1, one might consider various natural notions of distance between these two sets. A fixed notion of distance leads to a measure of suitability of a committee with respect to an election \u2014 for instance, by considering the sum of distances to all voters, or the maximum distance incurred from any voter. For a committee X and a vote S, the notions of distance that are wellstudied in the literature include the size of the symmetric difference (leading to the minisum or minimax rules) [Brams et al., 2007, LeGrand et al., 2007, Caragiannis et al., 2010, Gramm et al., 2003], the size of the intersection (leading to the notion of approval score), or the difference between |X \u2229S| and |X \\S| (leading to the notion of net approval scores) [Procaccia et al., 2008, Skowron and Faliszewski, 2015, Aziz et al., 2015].\nMotivation The standard approach to the selection of a winning committee is to look for one that optimizes these scoring functions over the entire election \u2014 that is, when the sum or max of scores are taken over all the votes. However, it is plausible that for some elections, there is a committee that represents a very good consensus when the scores are taken over a subset of the voters rather than the entire set. For example, consider the approval voting rule mentioned above. The approval score of a committee X is the sum of |X \u2229 S|, taken over all votes S in the electorate. Let the approval score per vote be the ratio of the approval score of X to n. For a committee of size k, the best approval score per vote possible is k. Clearly, the higher the approval score per vote, the greater a voter is \u2018satisfied\u2019 on average. Now, consider the following toy example. Let L \u2286 [m] be an arbitrary but fixed subset of k candidates. Suppose the election has (n \u2212 1) votes that are all exactly equal to L, and one vote that approves [m] \\ L. The best approval score per vote that one can hope for here is k(1\u2212 1/n), whereas if we restrict our attention to the election on the first (n\u2212 1) votes alone, then L\u2019s approval score per vote is k, which is now the best possible. Of course, the difference here is not significant for large n, but the illustration does provoke the following thought: is there a subset of at least n\u2217 votes that admit a committee whose approval score per vote is at least k\u2217? For n\u2217 = n, we are back to the original question of finding the best committee. This more general setting, however, allows us to explore trade-offs and structure in the election: if there is a committee that prescribes a very good consensus over a large fraction of the election, then it is likely to be a more suitable choice for the community compared to a committee that optimizes the same score function over the entire election. While these committees may coincide (as in the toy example), there are easy examples where they would not, making this a question worth exploring.\nThe notion of finding a good consensus over a large subset has been explored in various contexts. In particular, the idea of using outliers is quite common in the the literature of Closest String problems. The setting of closest string involves a collection of n strings, and the goal is to find a single string that minimizes either the maximum distance, or the sum of distances, from all the input strings. The most commonly studied notion of distance is the Hamming distance. Notice that once we interpret votes as binary strings, we are asking a very similar question, and the main distinction is that our search is only over strings that have a fixed number of ones. This similarity has been noted and explored in some works on voting before (see, for instance, [Byrka and Sornat, 2014]). In the context of Closest String, a question that is often asked is the following: given a budget k, is there a string that is \u201cclose to\u201d at least k strings? This question has been studied for both the minimax and minisum notions of closeness [Boucher et al., 2013, Lo et al., 2014]. Typically, the strings that are left out are called outliers. In the context of voting, one imagines that there may be a few votes that express rather tangential opinions, and that a good consensus emerges once they are removed. We will also refer to such votes as outliers. In the context of social choice theory, the very notion of Young voting rule can be regarded as to finding minimum number of outliers whose removal makes some candidate Condorcet winner [Young and Levenglick, 1978, Bartholdi III et al., 1989a, Rothe et al., 2003, Betzler et al., 2010].\nOur Framework One of the advantages of using scoring rules for approval ballots described above is that the winning committees are polynomially computable for most of them (with the notable exception\n1This is simply the subset of approved candidates.\nof the minimax voting rule). However, once we pose the question of whether a target score t is achievable after the removal of at most k outliers, the complexity landscape changes dramatically. We show that this question is a computationally hard problem \u2014 in particular, we establish NP-hardness. Having shown hardness in the classical setting, we explore the complexity further, primarily from the perspective of exact exponential algorithms and approximation algorithms. In the context of the former, we use the framework of parameterized complexity. Briefly, a parameterized problem instance comprises of an instance x in the usual sense, and a parameter k. A problem with parameter k is called fixed parameter tractable (FPT) if it is solvable in time f(k) \u00b7 p(|x|), where f is an arbitrary function of k and p is a polynomial in the input size |x|. While there have been important examples of traditional algorithms that have been analyzed in this fashion, the theoretical foundations for deliberate design of such algorithms, and a complementary complexity-theoretic framework for hardness, were developed in the late nineties [Downey and Fellows, 1988, Downey and Fellows, 1995a, Abrahamson et al., 1995, Downey and Fellows, 1995b]. Just as NP-hardness is used as evidence that a problem probably is not polynomial time solvable, there exists a hierarchy of complexity classes above FPT, and showing that a parameterized problem is hard for one of these classes is considered evidence that the problem is unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable. Indeed, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis, a problem hard forW[1] does not belong to FPT [Downey and Fellows, 1999a]. The main classes in this hierarchy are:\nFPT \u2286 W[1] \u2286 W[2] \u2286 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2286 W[P ] \u2286 XP,\nwhere a parameterized problem belongs to the class XP if there exists an algorithm for it with running time bounded by ng(k). A parameterized problem is said to be para-NP-complete if it is NP-complete even for constant values of the parameter. A classic example of a para-NP-complete problem is graph coloring parameterized by the number of colors \u2014 recall that it is NP-complete to determine if a graph can be properly colored with three colors. Observe that a para-NP-complete problem does not belong to XP unless P = NP. We are now ready to describe our contributions in greater detail."}, {"heading": "1.1 Our Contributions", "text": "We consider three standard approval scoring mechanisms, namely the minisum, approval, and net approval scores. The last two scores, as originally defined in the literature, are designed to simply give us the total amount of approval that a committee incurs from all the voters. The scores themselves are therefore nondecreasing functions of n, and as such, the question of outliers is not interesting if we use the scores directly (in particular, it is impossible to improve these scores by removing votes). Therefore, we consider the dual scoring system that complements the original \u2014 namely, we score a committee based on the amount disapproval that it incurs from all the votes, and seek to minimize the total disapproval. Typically, for any notion of approval, there are either one or two natural complementary notions of disapproval that present themselves (discussed in greater detail below). This formulation is consistent with the idea that we want our scores to capture \u201cdistance\u201d rather than closeness. We note that in terms of scores, these rules are equivalent to the original, but choosing to ask the minimization question allows us to formulate the problem of finding the best committee in the presence of outliers.\nRemark 1. One might also consider the approval score per vote instead of the total score, as described earlier. However, we chose to use the notion of disapproval because of its consistency with the other distance-based rules (like minisum and minimax). All the variations are equivalent as scoring functions, and we note that our choice is only a matter of exposition.\nIn Table 1, we summarize the notions of distances between a committee and a vote. Each of these notions naturally gives rise to a score-based voting rule. Formally, for any distance function s : 2C \u00d72C \u2192 N between two subsets of candidates, we overload notation and define the corresponding score function s : 2C \u00d7 V \u2192 N\nfor a set of votes V = {S1, . . . ,Sn} as follows:\ns(X ,V) := n \u2211\ni=1\ns(X ,Si)\nFor the winner determination problem, the goal is to find a committee X of size m\u2217 that minimizes s(X ,V). For all the scoring rules in Table 1, a winning committee of size m\u2217 can be found in polynomial time for any m\u2217 \u2264 m. We refer the reader to Table 2 for an overview of the notation we use in this paper. We are now ready to define the problem of winner determination for a scoring rule s in the presence of outliers:\ns-Outliers Input: A set of votes V = {S1, . . . ,Sn} over a set of candidates C = {c1, . . . , cm}, a committee size m\u2217, a target number of non-outliers n\u2217, and a target score t. Question: Does there exist a committee C\u2217 \u2282 C and a set of non-outliers V\u2217 \u2282 V such that |V\u2217| \u2265 n\u2217, |C\u2217| = m\u2217, and s(V\u2217, C\u2217) \u2264 t?\nRemark 2. We will focus on only one variant of disapproval for the approval scoring rule, namely the one given by the top row in Table 1. The other variation is symmetric and our results hold in the exact same fashion, as explained in Lemma 9 (in Section 6).\nWe first show that the s-Outliers problem is NP-complete for all the scoring rules considered here, even in the special case when every vote approves exactly three candidates and every candidate is approved by exactly three votes. This also establishes the para-NP-hardness of the problem with respect to the (combined) parameters (maximum) number of candidates approved by any vote and (maximum) number of votes that approve a candidate.\nTheorem 1. Let s \u2208 {Minisum, Disapproval, Net-Disapproval}. The s-Outliers problem is NP-complete even if every vote approves exactly 3 candidates and every candidate is approved by exactly 3 votes.\nTo initiate the parameterized study of the s-Outliers problem, we propose the following parameters: the size of the committee (m\u2217), the number of candidates not in the committee (m), the number of non-outliers (n\u2217), the number of outliers (n), and the target score t (which one might think of as the \u201csolution size\u201d or the standard parameter).\nOur main results are the following. For any subset of these parameters, we establish if the s-Outliers problem is FPT or W[1]-hard when s \u2208 {Minisum, Net Approval}, and for the Disapproval voting rule, we have a classification for all cases but one. Specifically, for the minisum voting rule, we establish the following dichotomy.\nTheorem 2. Let P = {m\u2217,m, n\u2217, n, t}, and Q \u2286 P. The Minisum-outliers problem parameterized by Q is FPT if Q contains either {m\u2217,m}, {n\u2217, n}, or {n, t}, and is W[1]-hard otherwise.\nFor the net disapproval voting rule, we establish the following dichotomy.\nTheorem 3. Let P = {m\u2217,m, n\u2217, n, t}, and Q \u2286 P. The Net-Disapproval-outliers problem parameterized by Q is FPT if Q contains either {m\u2217,m} or {n\u2217, n}, and is W[1]-hard otherwise.\nFurther, for the disapproval voting rule, we have the following theorem that classifies all cases but one.\nTheorem 4. Let P = {m\u2217,m, n\u2217, n, t}, and Q \u2286 P. The Disapproval-Outliers problem parameterized by Q is FPT if Q contains either {m\u2217,m} or {n\u2217, n}, and is W[1]-hard for all other cases except for Q = {m,n, t}.\nApart from these classification results in the context of exact algorithms, we also pursue approximation algorithms and other special cases. We briefly summarize our contributions in these contexts below.\nApproximation Results. We provide a polynomial time \u03b5m-approximation algorithm for optimizing the minisum score considering outliers, for every constant \u03b5 > 0 [Theorem 5]. We also show a (1+ \u03b5)-approximation algorithm for optimizing the minisum score considering outliers running in time nO(log m/\u03b5\n2), for every constant \u03b5 > 0 [Theorem 6]. On the hardness side, we show that in the presence of outliers, there does not exist an \u03b1(m,n)-aproximation algorithm for optimizing score of the selected committee for any computable function \u03b1(\u00b7, \u00b7), for the net disapproval [Corollary 2] and disapproval voting rules (unless P = NP) [Lemma 8].\nOther Special Cases. We show that when every voter approves at most one candidate, then the Minisumoutlier problem can be solved in polynomial amount of time. For some W[1]-hard cases, we show that the problem becomes FPT if the maximum number of candidates approved by a vote or the maximum number of votes that approve of a candidate is a constant. We refer the reader to Section 6 for a more detailed discussion."}, {"heading": "1.2 Related Work", "text": "The notion of outliers is quite prominent in the literature pertaining to closest strings, where the usual setting is that we are given n strings over some alphabet \u03a3, and the task is to find a string x that minimizes either the maximum Hamming distance from any string, or the sum of\nits Hamming distances from all strings. In the context of social choice theory, the notion of outliers are intimately related to manipulation and control of election by removing voters and candidates [Bartholdi et al., 1992, Bartholdi III et al., 1989b, Conitzer et al., 2007, Chevaleyre et al., 2007, Hemaspaandra et al., 2007, Brandt et al., 2012, Faliszewski et al., 2009, Faliszewski et al., 2011, Meir et al., 2008, Procaccia et al., 2007, Elkind et al., 2009, Betzler and Uhlmann, 2008].\nIn the minimax notion of distance, the problem of finding a closest string in the presence of outliers was initiated in [Boucher and Ma, 2011], and was further refined in [Boucher et al., 2013]. The work in [Boucher et al., 2013] demonstrates hardness of approximation for variations involving outliers. With the minisum notion of distance, the study of finding the best string with respect to outliers was studied in [Lo et al., 2014]. In contrast with the minimax rule, this work shows a PTAS for Consensus Sequence with Outliers.\nThe fact that the closest string problem has similarities to the setup of approval ballots has been explored in the past, see, for instance [Byrka and Sornat, 2014]. More specifically, and again in the spirit of observing similarities with the closest string family of problems, the minimax approval rule has been studied from the perspective of outliers [Misra et al., 2015]. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first comprehensive study of the complexity behavior of approval ballots in the presence of outliers."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In this section we briefly recall some terminology and notation that we will use throughout.\nApproval Voting Let V = {S1, . . . ,Sn} be the set of all votes and C = {c1, . . . , cm} the set of all candidates. Each vote Si is a subset of C. We say voter i approves a candidate x \u2208 C if x \u2208 Si; otherwise we say, voter i does not approve the candidate x. A voting rule r for choosing a committee of size m\u2217 is a mapping r : \u222an\u22651(2C)n \u2212\u2192 Pm\u2217(C), where Pm\u2217(C) is the set of all subsets of C of size m\u2217.

(Parameterized Reduction [Downey and Fellows, 1999b]) Let \u03931 and \u03932 be parameterized problems. A parameterized reduction from \u03931 to \u03932 is an algorithm that, given an instance (x, k) of \u03931, outputs an instance (x \u2032, k\u2032) of \u03932 such that:\n1.

In particular,\nwe show that the s-Outliers problem is hard for minisum, disapproval, and net disapproval voting rules. We reduce from the well known Vertex Cover problem, which is known to be NP-complete even on 3-regular graphs [Garey and Johnson, 1979].\n3-Vertex-cover Input: A 3-regular graph G and a positive integer k. Question: Is there a subset S of at most k vertices such that G[V \\ S] is an independent set?\nTheorem 1. Let s \u2208 {Minisum, Disapproval, Net-Disapproval}. The s-Outliers problem is NP-complete even if every vote approves exactly 3 candidates and every candidate is approved by exactly 3 votes.\nProof. First let us prove the result for the minisum voting rule. The problem is clearly in NP. To prove NP-hardness, we reduce the 3-Vertex-cover problem to the Minisum-outliers. Let (G = (U,E), k) be an arbitrary instance of 3-Vertex-cover problem. Let U = {u1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , un}. We will introduce a candidate and a vote corresponding to every vertex, and have candidate i approved by a vote j if and only if the vertices corresponding to i and j are adjacent in G. We define the corresponding instance (V , C, n\u2217,m\u2217, t) of the Minisum-outliers problem as follows:\nV = {S1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Sn}, C = {c1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , cn},\nSi = {cj : (ui, uj) \u2208 E} \u2200i \u2208 [n],\nn\u2217 = n\u2212 k,m\u2217 = k, t = (n\u2212 k)(k \u2212 3)\nNotice that, |Si| = 3 and each candidate is approved in exactly 3 votes since G is 3-regular. We claim that the two instances equivalent. In the forward direction, suppose W \u2282 U forms a vertex cover with |W | = k. Consider the committee C\u2217 = {ci : ui \u2208 W} and the set of nonoutliers V\u2217 = {Si : ui /\u2208 W}. We claim that h(Si, C\u2217) = (k \u2212 3) for every Si \u2208 V\u2217 thereby proving h(V\u2217, C\u2217) = (n \u2212 k)(k \u2212 3). Notice that, h(Si, C\u2217) \u2265 (k \u2212 3) since |C\u2217| = k and |Si| = 3 for every Si \u2208 V\u2217. Suppose, there exist an Si \u2208 V\u2217 such that h(Si, C\u2217) < k\u2212 3. Then there exist a candidate cj \u2208 Si \\ C\u2217. However, this implies that the edge (ui, uj) \u2208 E is not covered by W which contradicts that fact that W is a vertex cover.\nFor the reverse direction, suppose there exists a set of outliers V \u2282 V and a committee C\u2217 \u2282 C such that |V| \u2264 n, |C\u2217| = m\u2217, and h(V\u2217, C\u2217) \u2264 t. Since, adding votes in the set of outliers V can only reduce h(V\u2217, C\u2217), we may assume without loss of generality that |V| = n. Now, since h(Si, C\u2217) \u2265 (k \u2212 3) for every Si \u2208 V\u2217, we have h(V\u2217, C\u2217) = (n\u2212k)(k\u22123) and thus h(Si, C\u2217) = (k\u22123) for every Si \u2208 V \\V. Let X = {ui \u2208 U : Si \u2208 V\u2217} and Y = {ui \u2208 U : ci \u2208 C\u2217}. We claim that X covers all the edges incident on the vertices in Y. Indeed, otherwise there exist a ui \u2208 X such that all the edges incident on ui are not covered by Y and thus we have h(Si, C\u2217) > k \u2212 3. We now construct a vertex cover W of G of size at most k as follows. If X and Y are disjoint then, Y forms a vertex cover of G. Otherwise we let Y0 = Y, u \u2208 X \u2229 Y0, v \u2208 (U \\ X ) \\ Y0 and notice that Y0 \\ {u} still covers all the edges incident on X . We define Y1 = (Y0 \\ {u})\u222a {v}. We note that |X \u2229 Y1| = |X \u2229 Y0| \u2212 1 and |Y1| = |Y0|. We iterate this process for |X \u2229 Y| many times. Let us call Y|X\u2229Y| W . By the argument above, W covers all the edges incident on the vertices in X , W \u2229X = \u2205, and thus we have W = U \\ X . Hence, W forms a set cover of G.\nThe proofs for the other rules are identical, except for the values of the target score. We define t = (n \u2212 k)(k \u2212 3) for the disapproval, and t = (n \u2212 k)(k \u2212 6) for the net disapproval voting rule. It is easily checked that the details are analogous.\nTheorem 1 immediately yields the following corollary.\nCorollary 1. Let s \u2208 {Minisum, Disapproval, Net-Disapproval}.

We now identify the non-outliers V\u2217 with respect to the committee X .\nCase t \u2265 n\u2212 n: Use the algorithm in Proposition 1 which runs in O\u2217(2n) = O\u2217(2t+n) time.\n4.2 W[1]-hardness Results\nIn this section, we establish our W[1]-hardness results. To begin with, we focus on parameters combined with the target score t. Notice that we have tractability when we combine either (n+n\u2217) or (m+m\u2217) along with t (follows from Proposition 1). For minisum, we even have tractability for t and n, from Lemma 1. Therefore, the interesting combinations for the minisum rule are (t + n\u2217 + m) and (t + n\u2217 + m\u2217). We first consider the combination (t+ n\u2217 +m), and show W[1]-hardness for all the voting rules considered here by exhibiting a parameterized reduction from the d-Clique problem which is known to be W[1]-hard parameterized by clique size [Downey and Fellows, 2013].\nd-Clique Parameter: k Input: A d-regular graph G and a positive integer k. Question: Is there a clique of size k?\nLemma 2. The Minisum-outliers problem is W[1]-hard, when parameterized by (t + n\u2217 +m). Also, for s \u2208 {disapproval, net disapproval}, the s-Outliers problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by (n\u2217 +m), even when t = 0.\nProof. First let us prove the result for the Minisum-outliers problem. We exhibit a parameterized reduction from the d-Clique problem to the Minisum-outliers problem thereby proving the result. Let (G = (U,E), k) be an arbitrary instance of the d-Clique problem. Let U = {u1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , un} and E = {e1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , em}. We define the corresponding instance (V , C, n\u2217,m\u2217, t) of the Minisum-outliers problem as follows:\nV = {S1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Sm}, C = {c1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , cn},Si = {cj : uj /\u2208 ei} \u2200i \u2208 [n],\nn\u2217 =\n(\nk\n2\n)\n,m = k, t = (k \u2212 2)\n(\nk\n2\n)\nWe claim that the two instances are equivalent. In the forward direction, suppose W \u2282 U forms a clique with |W | = k, and let Q denote the set of edges that have both endpoints in W . Then the committee C\u2217 = {ci : ui /\u2208 W} along with the set of non-outliers V\u2217 = {Si : ui \u2208 Q} achieves minisum score of (k \u2212 2) (\nk 2\n)\n.\nIn the reverse direction, suppose there exist a set of non-outliers V\u2217 \u2282 V and a committee C\u2217 \u2282 C such that h(V\u2217, C\u2217) \u2264 (k \u2212 2) (\nk 2\n)\n. We claim that the vertices in W = {ui : ci \u2208 C} form a clique with edge set Q = {ei : Si \u2208 V\u2217}. If not then, there exist a vote Sj \u2208 V\u2217 such that h(Sj , C) \u2265 k. On the other hand we have h(Si, C) \u2265 k \u2212 2 for every Si \u2208 V\u2217. This implies that h(V\u2217, C\u2217) > (k \u2212 2) ( k 2 ) , which is a contradiction.\nWe define t = 0 for the disapproval and net disapproval voting rules. It is easily checked that the details are analogous.\nWe now turn to the combination (m\u2217+n\u2217+ t). Again, we have W[1]-hardness for all voting rules considered.\nLemma 3. Let s \u2208 {Minisum, Net-Disapproval, Disapproval}. Then the s-Outliers problem is W[1]-hard, when parameterized by (t+m\u2217 + n\u2217), even when every vote approves exactly two candidates.\nWe now consider the other combinations involving t that are non-trivial for voting rules different from minisum, namely (t+n+m\u2217) and (t+n+m). Lemma 4 below shows W[1]-hardness for the first combination, for the Disapproval voting rule. This also shows W[1]-hardness with respect to the parameter (n+m\u2217) alone, for the minisum voting rule.\nLemma 4. The Minisum-Outliers problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by (n + m\u2217). Also, the Disapproval-Outliers problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by (m\u2217+n), even when the target score t = 0. In particular, s-Outliers is W[1]-hard parameterized by (m\u2217 + n+ t).\nProof. To begin with, let us prove the result for the Minisum-outliers problem. We exhibit a parameterized reduction from the d-Clique problem to the Minisum-outliers problem thereby proving the result. Let (G = (U,E), k) be an arbitrary instance of the d-Clique problem. Let U = {u1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , un} and E = {e1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , em}. We define the corresponding instance (V , C, n\u2217,m\u2217, t) of the Minisum-outliers problem as follows:\nV = {S1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Sn}, C = {c1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , cm},Si = {cj : ui /\u2208 ej} \u2200i \u2208 [n],\nn = k,m\u2217 =\n(\nk\n2\n)\n, t = (m\u2212\n(\nk\n2\n)\n)(n\u2212 k)\nWe claim that the two instances are equivalent. In the forward direction, suppose W \u2282 U forms a clique with |W | = k, and let Q denote the set of edges that have both endpoints in W . Then the committee C\u2217 = {ci : ei \u2208 Q} and the set of non-outliers V\u2217 = {Si : ui /\u2208 W} achieves minisum score of (m\u2212 ( k 2 ) )(n\u2212k).\nIn the reverse direction, suppose there exist a set of outliers V \u2282 V and a committee C\u2217 \u2282 C such that h(V\u2217, C\u2217) \u2264 (m \u2212 (\nk 2\n)\n)(n \u2212 k). We claim that the vertices in W = {ui : Si \u2208 V} form a clique. If not then, there exist a candidate x \u2208 C\u2217 that is not approved by at least one vote in V\u2217. However, this implies that h(V\u2217, C\u2217) > (m\u2212 (\nk 2\n)\n)(n\u2212 k), which is a contradiction.\nWe define t = 0 for the disapproval voting rule. It is easily checked that the details are analogous.\nNext, we show that Net-Disapproval-outliers is W[1]-hard with respect to the combined parameter (n+ t+m\u2217).\nLemma 5. The Net-Disapproval-outliers problem is W[1]-hard, when parameterized by (n + m\u2217), even when the target score is 0. In particular, Net-Disapproval-outliers problem is W[1]-hard, when parameterized by (t+ n+m\u2217).\nProof. We reduce the Clique problem to the Net-approval-outlier problem. Let (G = (U,E), k) be an arbitrary instance of the Clique problem. Let U = {u1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , un}. We define the corresponding instance (V , C, n\u2217,m\u2217, t) of the Net-approval-outlier problem as follows:\nC = {ce : e \u2208 E} \u222aD, where |D| =\n(\nk\n2\n)\n,\nV = {S1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Sn} \u222a {T1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Tn+2k},\nSi = {ce : ui /\u2208 e}, \u2200i \u2208 [n], Tj = D, \u2200j \u2208\n[(\nk\n2\n)]\n,\nn = k, m\u2217 = 2\n(\nk\n2\n)\n, t = 0\nWe claim that the two instances equivalent. In the forward direction, suppose G has a clique on a subset of vertices W \u2282 U of size k; let Q be the clique edges. Then we define the set of outlier votes to be V = {Si : ui \u2208 W} and the committee to be the set of candidates C\u2217 = D \u222a {ce : e \u2208 Q}. Now we have \u2211\nS\u2208V\u2217 |S \u2229 C \u2217| = (n\u2212 k)\n(\nk 2\n) + (n+ 2k)|D| = (n+ k) ( k 2 ) and \u2211 S\u2208V\u2217 |S c \u2229 C\u2217| = (n\u2212 k)|D|+ (n+ 2k) ( k 2 ) =\n(n+ k) ( k 2 ) thereby achieving the net approval score t of 0.\nIn the reverse direction, suppose we have a set of outlier votes V and a committee C\u2217 which achieves a net approval score t of 0. First observe that we can assume without loss of generality that D is a subset of C\u2217 since irrespective of the outliers chosen, every candidate in D receives at least (n + k) approvals and every candidate not in D receives at most n approvals. Now since the committee C\u2217 contains D, for every j \u2208 [n + 2k], the vote Tj contributes at most |D| \u2212 ( k 2 ) = 0 to the net approval score, whereas, for every i \u2208 [n], the vote Si contributes at least ( k 2 )\n\u2212 |D| = 0 to the net approval score. Hence, we may assume without loss of generality that Tj belongs to the set of non-outliers V\u2217 for every j \u2208 [n+ 2k]. Now we claim\nthat the set of edges Q = {e : ce \u2208 C\u2217} must form a clique on the set of vertices W = {u : Su \u2208 V}. If not then, \u2211\nS\u2208V\u2217 |S \u2229 C \u2217| < (n+ k)\n(\nk 2\n)\nand \u2211 S\u2208V\u2217 |S c \u2229C\u2217| > (n+ k)\n(\nk 2\n)\nthereby making the net approval score t strictly more than 0.\nFinally, we show that for all rules considered, the s-Outliers problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by (n + m). In particular, for the Net-Disapproval-outliers problem, we have W[1]-hardness even when t = 0 and every candidate is approved in exactly two votes.\nLemma 6. Let s \u2208 {Minisum, Disapproval, Net-Disapproval}. Then s-Outliers is W[1]-hard, when parameterized by (n + m), even when every candidate is approved in exactly two votes. Further, the NetDisapproval-outliers problem, parameterized by (n+m), is W[1]-hard even when t = 0 and every candidate is approved in exactly two votes. In particular, the Net-Disapproval-outliers problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by (n+m+ t).\nProof. First let us prove the result for the Minisum-outliers problem. We exhibit a parameterized reduction from the d-Clique problem to the Minisum-outliers problem thereby proving the result. Let (G = (U,E), k) be an arbitrary instance of the d-Clique problem. Let U = {u1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , un} and E = {e1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , em}. We define the corresponding instance (V , C, n\u2217,m\u2217, t) of the Minisum-outliers problem as follows:\nV = {S1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Sn}, C = {c1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , cm},Si = {cj : ui \u2208 ej}, \u2200i \u2208 [n],\nn = k,m =\n(\nk\n2\n)\n, t = (n\u2212 k)\n(\nm\u2212\n(\nk\n2\n)\n\u2212 d\n)\nWe claim that the two instances are equivalent. In the forward direction, suppose W \u2282 U forms a clique with |W | = k, and let Q denotes the set of edges that have both endpoints in W . Consider the committee C\u2217 = {ci : ei /\u2208 Q} and the set of outliers V = {Si : ui \u2208 W}. Consider now a vote Sj \u2208 V\u2217. Note that |C\u2217 \u2229 Sj | = d, since every edge incident on uj is an edge that does not belong to Q, by the definition of C \u2217. Further, this also implies that |C\u2217 \\ Sj | = ( m\u2212 ( k 2 ) \u2212 d ) . Therefore, h(Sj , C\u2217) = ( m\u2212 ( k 2 ) \u2212 d ) . Hence we have h(V\u2217, C\u2217) = (n\u2212 k) ( m\u2212 (\nk 2\n) \u2212 d ) .\nFor the reverse direction, suppose there exist a set of non-outliers V\u2217 \u2282 V and a committee C\u2217 \u2282 C such that h(V\u2217, C\u2217) \u2264 (n \u2212 k) ( m\u2212 (\nk 2\n) \u2212 d )\n. We claim that the vertices in W = {ui : Si \u2208 V} form a clique. If not\nthen there exists a vote S \u2208 V\u2217, such that h(S, C\u2217) > ( m\u2212 (\nk 2\n) \u2212 d ) . However, for every vote S \u2032 \u2208 V\u2217, we\nhave h(S \u2032, C\u2217) \u2265 ( m\u2212 (\nk 2\n) \u2212 d ) . This makes h(V\u2217, C\u2217) > (n\u2212 k) ( m\u2212 (\nk 2\n) \u2212 d ) which is a contradiction.\nThe proofs for the other rules are identical, except for the values of the target score. We define t = (n\u2212 k) ( m\u2212 (\nk 2\n) \u2212 d ) for the disapproval voting rule. For the net disapproval voting rule, we add (m\u2212 2d)\nmany dummy candidates who are approved by every vote. We keep m = ( k 2 )\nand make t = 0. It is easily checked that the remaining details are analogous."}, {"heading": "4.3 Proofs of the Main Theorems", "text": "We are now ready to present the proofs of Theorems 2 to 4 .

Our first hardness result is that it is NP-hard to check even if there is a subset of outliers and a corresponding committee for which the net disapproval score is zero. This follows from Lemma 6.\nCorollary 2. There does not exist any polynomial time \u03b1(m,n)-approximation algorithm for the NetDisapproval-outliers problem for any computable function \u03b1(\u00b7, \u00b7), unless P = NP.\nNext, we show that it is NP-hard to check even if there is a subset of outliers and a corresponding committee for which the disapproval score is zero. For this, we reduce from a problem closely related to Max-Clique, namely that of finding a largest-sized biclique in a graph G, which is known to be NPcomplete [Garey and Johnson, 1979, Johnson, 1987].\nBiclique Input: An undirected bipartite graph G = (VL, VR, E) and an integer k Question: Do there exist two subsets of vertices A \u2282 VL and B \u2282 VR with |A| = |B| = k such that (A,B) forms a biclique?\nLemma 8. There does not exist any polynomial time \u03b1(m,n)-approximation algorithm for Disapprovaloutliers for any computable function \u03b1(\u00b7, \u00b7), unless P = NP.\nProof. We will show that deciding whether the optimal disapproval score is zero or not, is NP-complete, thereby implying the result. The problem is clearly in NP. To prove NP-hardness, we reduce the Biclique problem to the Disapproval-outliers problem. Let (G = (VL, VR, E), k) be an arbitrary instance of the Biclique problem. Let VL = {u1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , un} and VR = {u\u20321, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , u \u2032 m}. We define the corresponding instance (V , C, n\u2217,m\u2217, t) of the Disapproval-outliers problem as follows:\nV = {S1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Sn}, C = {c1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , cm},\nSi = {cj : (ui, u \u2032 j) \u2208 E} \u2200i \u2208 [n], n \u2217 = k,m\u2217 = k, t = 0\nWe claim that the two instances are equivalent. In the forward direction, suppose A \u2282 VL and B \u2282 VR with |A| = |B| = k forms a biclique. Consider the set of non-outliers to be V\u2217 = {Si : ui \u2208 A} and the committee C\u2217 = {cj : u\u2032j \u2208 B}. This achieves disapproval score of 0. In the reverse direction, suppose there exist a set of non-outliers V\u2217 and a committee C\u2217 which achieves disapproval score of 0. Without loss of generality, we assume that |V\u2217| = k since removing votes from the set of non-outliers can only reduce the score. Consider A = {ui : Si \u2208 V\u2217} \u2282 VL and B = {cj : cj \u2208 C\u2217} \u2282 VR. We claim that A and B must form a biclique. Indeed, otherwise the disapproval score would be strictly more than 0."}, {"heading": "6 Concluding Remarks and Future Directions", "text": "We have studied the problem of determining the a committee that is good for a large portion of the electorate, based on some common voting rules. We begin this is section by showing that our choice of the notion of disapproval was an arbitrary one, by demonstrating the following lemma. We use the notation disapproval\u2032 to denote the voting rule given by the corresponding bottom row in Table 1.\nLemma 9. There is a polynomial time approximation preserving reduction from Disapproval-outliers problem to Disapproval\u2032-outliers problem and vice-versa. Moreover, the reductions are such that m\u2217 in the original instance becomes m in the reduced instance, m in the original instance becomes m\u2217 in the reduced instance, and every other parameter remain exactly same.\nProof. We provide the reduction from Disapproval-outliers to Disapproval\u2032-outliers. The other cases are exactly same. Let (V , C, n\u2217,m\u2217, t) be an arbitrary instance of Disapproval-outliers. We define the corresponding instance (V \u2032, C\u2032, n\u2217\u2032,m\u2217\u2032, t\u2032) of Disapproval\u2032-outliers as follows.\nC\u2032 = C,S \u2032i = {x \u2208 C \u2032 : x /\u2208 Si}, n \u2217\u2032 = n\u2217,m\u2217\u2032 = m, t\u2032 = t\nWe claim that the two instances are equivalent. If there exist a V\u2217 \u2282 V and C\u2217 \u2282 C such that sdisapproval(V\u2217, C\u2217) \u2264 t then sdisapproval\u2032 (V\u2217, C) \u2264 t and vice versa.\nThere are some very special cases that are solvable in polynomial time. In particular, when every candidate is approved by at most one vote, or when every vote approves at most one candidate, then the Minisumoutliers problem can be solved in polynomial amount of time.\nLemma 10. The Minisum-outliers problem is in P when every vote approves at most one candidate.\nProof. The following greedy algorithm computes the committee and the set of outliers which achieves lowest minisum score. First choose the m\u2217 candidates with maximum number of approvals. Let C\u2217 be the chosen set of m\u2217 candidates. Let U be the set of votes who approve some candidate in C\u2217, W be the set of votes who approve some candidate in C(= C \\ C\u2217), and Y = V \\ (U \u222aW ). Then, if |W | \u2265 n, then define the set of outliers to be V for any arbitrary V \u2286 W with |V| = n. If |W | < n and |W |+ |Y | \u2265 n, then define the set of outliers to be V = W \u222aZ, for any arbitrary Z \u2286 Y with |Z| = n\u2212 |W |. Otherwise, define the set of outliers to be W \u222a Y \u222a A, for any arbitrary A \u2286 U with |A| = n\u2212 |W |+ |Y |.\nLemma 11. The Minisum-outliers problem is in P when every candidate is approved in at most one vote\nProof. Consider the following dynamic programming based algorithm. Let the votes be S1,S2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Sn. We define M(i, j, \u2113) to be a set of j outliers (call it an optimal set of outliers) that minimizes the sum of Hamming distances when we are selecting a committee of size \u2113 considering only votes in {S1,S2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Si}. We compute the value of M(i, j, \u2113). Consider the case when the vote Si belongs to an optimal set of outliers when we are selecting a committee of size \u2113 considering only votes in {S1,S2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Si}. In this case, M(i, j, \u2113) = M(i \u2212 1, j \u2212 1, \u2113). Consider the other case when the vote Si does not belong to any optimal set of outliers when we are selecting a committee of size \u2113 considering only votes in {S1,S2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Si}. Then M(i, j, \u2113) = M(i \u2212 1, j, \u2113 \u2212 |Si|) if \u2113 \u2265 |Si| and M(i, j, \u2113) = M(i \u2212 1, j, 0) otherwise, since when the vote Si is not an outlier then we can assume without loss of generality that the committee has maximum overlap with the vote Si. Base cases are taken care from the fact that M(i, j, \u2113) can be computed in polynomial time irrespective of the values of \u2113 and j when i is a constant. We compute the value of M(i, j, \u2113) for every i \u2208 [n], j \u2264 i, \u2113 \u2208 [m]. M(n, n,m\u2217) gives us the optimal set of outliers (which also in turn gives us the committee to choose).\nFuture Directions One pertinent open problem is to close the only unresolved case of parameterized complexity of s-Outliers for the disapproval voting rule when parameterized by (m,n, t). It is also open to improve, or prove lower bounds, for our approximation results in the context of the minsum voting rule. Refining the FPT fragment of our dichotomy to kerenlization is also an exciting direction for further investigation. Finally, we are also interested in extending our dichotomous results to a dichotomy based on more parameters. We have made progress towards that by incorporating two more parameters, namely the maximum number of candidates that any vote approves and maximum number of approvals that any candidate obtains."}], "references": [{"title": "Fixed-parameter tractability and completeness IV: on completeness for W[P] and PSPACE analogues", "author": ["Abrahamson et al", "K.R. 1995] Abrahamson", "R.G.
