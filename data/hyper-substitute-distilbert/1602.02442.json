Our method achieves an accelerated convergence rate on strongly convex smooth problems. Our method has only one parameter (a step size), and is radically simpler than other accelerated methods for finite sums. Additionally it can be applied when the terms are non-smooth, yielding a method applicable in many areas where operator splitting methods would traditionally be applied.\nIntroduction\nA large body of recent developments in optimization have focused on minimization of convex finite sums of the form:\nf(x) = 1\nn n\u2211 i=1 fi(x),\na very general class of problems including the empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework as a special case. Any function h can be written in this form by setting f1(x) = h(x) and fi = 0 for i 6= 1, however when each fi is sufficiently regular in a way that can be made precise, it is possible to optimize such sums more efficiently than by treating them as black box functions.\nIn most cases recently developed methods such as SAG [Schmidt et al., 2013] can find an -minimum faster than either stochastic gradient descent or accelerated black-box approaches, both in theory and in practice. We call this class of methods fast incremental gradient methods (FIG).\nFIG methods are randomized methods similar to SGD, however unlike SGD they are able to achieve linear convergence rates under Lipschitz-smooth and strong convexity conditions [Mairal, 2014, Defazio et al., 2014b, Johnson and Zhang, 2013, Konec\u030cn\u00fd and Richt\u00e1rik, 2013]. The linear rate in the first wave of FIG methods directly depended on the condition number (L/\u00b5) of the problem, whereas recently several methods have been developed that depend on the square-root of the condition number [Lan and Zhou, 2015, Lin et al., 2015, Shalev-Shwartz and Zhang, 2013c, Nitanda, 2014]. Analogous to the black-box case, these methods are known as accelerated methods.\nIn this work we develop another accelerated method, which is conceptually simpler and requires less tuning than existing accelerated methods. The method we give is a primal approach, however it makes use of a proximal operator oracle for each fi instead of a gradient oracle, unlike other primal approaches. The proximal operator is also used by dual methods such as some variants of SDCA [Shalev-Shwartz and Zhang, 2013a].\n29th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain.\nar X\niv :1\n60 2.\n02 44\n2v 2\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n2 7\nO ct\n2 01\nAlgorithm 1 Pick some starting point x0 and step size \u03b3.

For convenience, we use the following compact notation:\nprox\u03b3i (x) = argminy { \u03b3fi(y) + 1\n2 \u2016x\u2212 y\u20162\n} .\nThis proximal operator can be computed efficiently or in closed form in many cases, see Section 4 for details. Like SAGA, we also maintain a table of gradients gi, one for each function fi. We denote the state of gi at the end of step k by gki . The iterate (our guess at the solution) at the end of step k is denoted xk. The starting iterate x0 may be chosen arbitrarily.\nThe full algorithm is given as Algorithm 1. The sum of gradients 1n \u2211n i=1 g k i can be cached and updated efficiently at each step, and in most cases instead of storing a full vector for each gi, only a single real value needs to be stored. This is the case for linear regression or binary classification with logistic loss or hinge loss, in precisely the same way as for standard SAGA. A discussion of further implementation details is given in Section 4.\nWith step size\n\u03b3 =\n\u221a (n\u2212 1)2 + 4nL\u00b5\n2Ln \u2212 1\u2212 1n 2L ,\nthe expected convergence rate in terms of squared distance to the solution is given by: E \u2225\u2225xk \u2212 x\u2217\u2225\u22252 \u2264 (1\u2212 \u00b5\u03b3\n1 + \u00b5\u03b3\n)k \u00b5+ L\n\u00b5 \u2225\u2225x0 \u2212 x\u2217\u2225\u22252 , when each fi : Rd \u2192 R is L-smooth and \u00b5-strongly convex. See Nesterov [1998] for definitions of these conditions. Using big-O notation, the number of steps required to reduce the distance to the solution by a factor is:\nk = O\n((\u221a nL\n\u00b5 + n\n) log ( 1 )) ,\nas \u2192 0. This rate matches the lower bound known for this problem [Lan and Zhou, 2015] under the gradient oracle. We conjecture that this rate is optimal under the proximal operator oracle as well. Unlike other accelerated approaches though, we have only a single tunable parameter (the step size \u03b3), and the algorithm doesn\u2019t need knowledge of L or \u00b5 except for their appearance in the step size.\nCompared to the O ((L/\u00b5+ n) log (1/ )) rate for SAGA and other non-accelerated FIG methods, accelerated FIG methods are significantly faster when n is small compared to L/\u00b5, however for n \u2265 L/\u00b5 the performance is essentially the same. All known FIG methods hit a kind of wall at n \u2248 L/\u00b5, where they decrease the error at each step by no more than 1\u2212 1n . Indeed, when n \u2265 L/\u00b5 the problem is so well conditioned so as to be easy for any FIG method to solve it efficiently. This is sometimes called the big data setting [Defazio et al., 2014b].\nOur convergence rate can also be compared to that of optimal first-order black box methods, which have rates of the form k = O ((\u221a L/\u00b5 ) log (1/ ) ) per epoch equivalent. We are able to achieve a \u221a n speedup on a per-epoch basis, for n not too large. Of course, all of the mentioned rates are significantly better than the O ((L/\u00b5) log (1/ )) rate of gradient descent.\nFor non-smooth but strongly convex problems, we prove a 1/ -type rate under a standard iterate averaging scheme. This rate does not require the use of decreasing step sizes, so our algorithm requires less tuning than other primal approaches on non-smooth problems."}, {"heading": "2 Relation to other approaches", "text": "Our method is most closely related to the SAGA method. To make the relation clear, we may write our method\u2019s main step as:\nxk+1 = xk \u2212 \u03b3 [ f \u2032j(x k+1)\u2212 gkj + 1\nn n\u2211 i=1 gki\n] ,\nwhereas SAGA has a step of the form:\nxk+1 = xk \u2212 \u03b3 [ f \u2032j(x k)\u2212 gkj + 1\nn n\u2211 i=1 gki\n] .\nThe difference is the point at which the gradient of fj is evaluated at. The proximal operator has the effect of evaluating the gradient at xk+1 instead of xk. While a small difference on the surface, this change has profound effects. It allows the method to be applied directly to non-smooth problems using fixed step sizes, a property not shared by SAGA or other primal FIG methods. Additionally, it allows for much larger step sizes to be used, which is why the method is able to achieve an accelerated rate.\nIt is also illustrative to look at how the methods behave at n = 1. SAGA degenerates into regular gradient descent, whereas our method becomes the proximal-point method [Rockafellar, 1976]:\nxk+1 = prox\u03b3f (x k).\nThe proximal point method has quite remarkable properties. For strongly convex problems, it converges for any \u03b3 > 0 at a linear rate. The downside being the inherent difficulty of evaluating the proximal operator. For the n = 2 case, if each term is an indicator function for a convex set, our algorithm matches Dykstra\u2019s projection algorithm if we take \u03b3 = 2 and use cyclic instead of random steps.\nAccelerated incremental gradient methods\nSeveral acceleration schemes have been recently developed as extensions of non-accelerated FIG methods. The earliest approach developed was the ASDCA algorithm [Shalev-Shwartz and Zhang, 2013b,c]. The general approach of applying the proximal-point method as the outer-loop of a doubleloop scheme has been dubbed the Catalyst algorithm Lin et al. [2015]. It can be applied to accelerate any FIG method. Recently a very interesting primal-dual approach has been proposed by Lan and Zhou [2015]. All of the prior accelerated methods are significantly more complex than the approach we propose, and have more complex proofs."}, {"heading": "3 Theory", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Proximal operator bounds", "text": "In this section we rehash some simple bounds from proximal operator theory that we will use in this work.

Proximal operators For the most common binary classification and regression methods, imple-\nmenting the proximal operator is straight-forward. We include details of the computation of the proximal operators for the hinge, square and logistic losses in the supplementary material. The logistic loss does not have a closed form proximal operator, however it may be computed very efficiently in practice using Newton\u2019s method on a 1D subproblem. For problems of a non-trivial dimensionality the cost of the dot products in the main step is much greater than the cost of the proximal operator evaluation. We also detail how to handle a quadratic regularizer within each term\u2019s prox operator, which has a closed form in terms of the unregularized prox operator.\nInitialization Instead of setting g0i = f \u2032i(x0) before commencing the algorithm, we recommend using g0i = 0 instead.

SDCA was chosen as the inner algorithm for the catalyst scheme as it doesn\u2019t require a step-size, making it the most practical of the variants. Catalyst applied to SDCA is essentially the same algorithm as proposed in Shalev-Shwartz and Zhang [2013c]. A single inner epoch was used for each SDCA invocation. Accelerated MISO as well as the primal-dual FIG method [Lan and Zhou, 2015] were excluded as we wanted to test on sparse problems and they are not designed to take advantage of sparsity. The step-size parameter for each method (\u03ba for catalyst-SDCA) was chosen using a grid search of powers of 2. The step size that gives the lowest error at the final epoch is used for each method.\nWe selected a set of commonly used datasets from the LIBSVM repository [Chang and Lin, 2011]. The pre-scaled versions were used when available. Logistic regression with L2 regularization was applied to each problem. The L2 regularization constant for each problem was set by hand to ensure f was not in the big data regime n \u2265 L/\u00b5; as noted above, all the methods perform essentially the same when n \u2265 L/\u00b5. The constant used is noted beneath each plot. Open source code to exactly replicate the experimental results is available at https://github.com/adefazio/point-saga.\nAlgorithm scaling with respect to n The key property that distinguishes accelerated FIG methods from their non-accelerated counterparts is their performance scaling with respect to the dataset size. For large datasets on well-conditioned problems we expect from the theory to see little difference between the methods. To this end, we ran experiments including versions of the datasets subsampled randomly without replacement in 10% and 5% increments, in order to show the scaling with n empirically. The same amount of regularization was used for each subset.\nFigure 1 shows the function value sub-optimality for each dataset-subset combination. We see that in general accelerated methods dominate the performance of their non-accelerated counter-parts. Both SDCA and SAGA are much slower on some datasets comparatively than others. For example, SDCA is very slow on the 5 and 10% COVTYPE datasets, whereas both SAGA and SDCA are much slower than the accelerated methods on the AUSTRALIAN dataset. These differences reflect known properties of the two methods. SAGA is able to adapt to inherent strong convexity while SDCA can be faster on very well-conditioned problems.\nThere is no clear winner between the two accelerated methods, each gives excellent results on each problem. The Pegasos (stochastic gradient descent) algorithm with its slower than linear rate is a clear loser on each problem, almost appearing as an almost horizontal line on the log scale of these plots.\nNon-smooth problems We also tested the RCV1 dataset on the hinge loss. In general we did not expect an accelerated rate for this problem, and indeed we observe that Point-SAGA is roughly as fast as SDCA across the different dataset sizes."}, {"heading": "A Proximal operators", "text": "For the most common binary classification and regression methods, implementing the proximal operator is straight-forward.
