A core goal of the project is the use of computational biology, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques to investigate intertextuality, reception, and related phenomena of literary significance. As a case study in our approach, here we describe the use of sequence alignment, a common technique in genomics, to detect intertextuality in Latin literature. Sequence alignment is distinguished by its ability to find inexact verbal parallels, which makes it ideal for identifying phonetic resemblances in large corpora of Latin texts. Although especially suited to Latin, sequence alignment in principle can be extended to many other languages. keywords intertextuality; sequence alignment; Latin; epic; computational biology; natural language processing INTRODUCTION The current project, directed by the co\u00adauthors, grew out of shared interests in classical intertextuality dating back to a seminar taught at Dartmouth College in 2009. The idea for a collaborative and interdisciplinary study of intertextuality was first discussed by us in January 2014, inspired locally by Dexter\u2019s work in computational biology and globally by the rise of the Digital Humanities and \u201cbig data\u201d approaches to cultural study. The project has since received support from the Neukom Institute for Computational Science, the Office of the Provost at Dartmouth College, and the American Council of Learned Societies. The core of the project team includes faculty and graduate students at Dartmouth College, Harvard University, and other institutions, but crucial contributions have also been made by other collaborators, including undergraduate research assistants as well as high school students and teachers. The impetus for bridging the disciplines of biology and literary study is both cultural and methodological. The cultural motive derives from the familiar analogies often drawn between literature and living organisms, whether the use of trees or woods as a metaphor for literary works and traditions, or the imaginative casting of poems and books as living embodiments or descendants of their author. Such analogies have a long pedigree and have taken many different forms: one famous instance occurs at the end of Ovid\u2019s \u200bMetamorphoses\u200b, when the poet conceives of his own life as inextricably entwined with the life of his epic, a work which itself thematizes the mutually implicated transformation of bodies and words. Although the comparisons across these two domains are of countless types and have distinctive local functions in the particular works, collectively they invite critics to scrutinize the basic analogy: in what way can literature and living organisms profitably be linked?", "creator": null}}}
