Introduction\nCorpus linguistics has been in the spotlight for the last decade, with the usage of modern computers\nand technologies deeper understanding of languages can be obtained. Corpus linguistics helps language teaching for acquiring a better view for language. Language teachers will know what sequence of words and patters tend to co-occur. Unlike previous enormous lists of words which students were forced to memorize them, and were seldom used and typically were forgotten in a short period of time lexical bundles can help language teachers to teach more effectively, and learners can be more fluent in the second language. The first studies in lexical bundles include Firth 1964 (Firth, J. R. (1964).) Biber (2004), (Cortes, V. (2004). Native speakers use a formulaic pattern of speech which they are unaware of but learners from other languages use bundles that are affected (transferred) bye their mother tongue and this solely can be problematic and easily recognizable. moreover in academia, when speakers of source language trying to write, publish, and produce academic literature in the target language their lack the fluency and native like features of a native speaker of that language. Lexical bundles (or as called N-grams) are crucial in getting a fluent academic text. In this paper lexical bundles of 1 to 5 tokens from an 8 million word corpus of academic literature from the Computational Linguistics field and its sub topics such as: Speech recognition, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Information Retrieval have been extracted and analyzed. On the top of that most of typical criteria for exclusion has been applied to the list as well as calculating MI factor for each result to confirm the results and reaching the target bundles for Computational Linguistics.\n2. Methodology and Data\nThe corpus of Computational linguistics\u2019 academic literature is an 8 million word corpus of Journal\npublications, books, and theses. These include interdisciplinary topics such as Speech Recognition, Experimental Phonology, Language Models, Machine Learning, Semantics, Syntactic Theory, and Information Retrieval.\nof Authors, references, formulas, and tables were removed in order to minimize the \"Noise\" from the results.\nThe corpus was saved in txt file and analyzed by KfNgram program for linguistic research. Fletcher, 2007 (Fletcher, W. (2007).\n2.1 Extracting Lexical Bundles\nAs biber et al. (1999) states \"lexical bundles are sequences of words that commonly go together in\nnatural discourse\".\n2.2 filtering criteria\nIn order for our data to be in a consistent and logical form and not to be too long and out of the\ntopic or even unusable we have to filter our results. Excluding certain lexical bundles does not mean that they are not lexical bundles or they don't meet the requirements, undoubtedly and technically they are, however it is only for pedagogical purposes these lexical bundles do not have the characteristics to meet the scope and goal of this study or as Salazar D. (2011) says \"\u2026additional step was found to be necessary for the study to achieve its primary objective of creating a list of only the pedagogical useful bundles in scientific writing.\" this exclusion includes bundles that are detached (an integrated model, the operator), bundles that include numeric (House et al 2001).\nbundles and therefore cannot be used in our research\ncan be is part of a bigger chunk can be used\nBundles ending in articles: As can be seen most of the lexical bundles ending in articles (a, an, the)\nare part of other larger lexical bundles and therefore they are moreless duplicates of the latter e.g. in addition to the, argue in favor of the, the output of the.\nbundles with random numbers: bundles including random numbers such as: from gate 2 in 1999\nMeaningless bundles: these bundles do not have any meaning and therefore cannot be used in our\nresearch examples are: de bot t van els, englewood cliffs nj prentice-hall\nNoise: Noise refers to any numeric, symbol, alphabet which neither has meaning, nor is\ngrammatically correct. e.g. \u00e2 \u00e2 \u00e2 \u00e2, t 1 t 1\n3.0 Structure, function and frequency of bundles\nThis chapter analyses and categorizes lexical bundles by their frequency, function and structure.\n3.1 Frequency of Lexical Bundles\nA total number of 591 bundles across the 8 million corpus of Computational Linguistics discipline\nhave has been extracted. These n-grams have been elected from 1-grams to 5-grams varying in size.\nTables 3.1 shows the distribution of 2-5 part lexical bundles by their size.\nNumber of words Frequency 2 words 212 3 words 211 4 words 85 5 words 78\n586\nThese 586 bundles which make up only 1797 tokens consist only 0.02% of the total 8 million\ncorpus; however only the top 5 results from each n-gram category (1 to 5 parts that is a total of only 25 bundles) have occurred more than 126800 times which is approximately 1.6% of the corpus.\n3.2 Structure of lexical bundles\nAs biber (1999) observed lexical bundles tend to fall into several structural categories that are\nrelated to each other.\nNoun phrase with of-phrase fragment\nthe end of the, the beginning of the, the base of the, the point of view of\nNoun phrase with other post-modifier fragments\nthe way in which, the relationship between the, such a way as to\nPrepositional phrase with embedded ofphrase fragment\nabout the nature of as a function of as a result of the, from the point of view of\nOther prepositional phrase (fragment) as in the case, at the same time as, in such a way as to\nAnticipatory it + verb phrase/adjective phrase it is possible to, it may be necessary to, it can be seen, it should be noted that, it is interesting to note that Passive verb + prepositional phrase fragment is shown in figure/fig., is based on the, is to be found in Copula be + noun phrase/adjective phrase is one of the, may be due to, is one of the most (Verb phrase +) that-clause fragment has been shown that, that there is a, studies have shown that (Verb/adjective +) to-clause fragment are likely to be, has been shown to, to be able to Adverbial clause fragment as shown in figure/fig., as we have seen Pronoun/noun phrase + be (+...) this is not the, there was no significant, this did not mean that, this is not to say Other expressions that as well as the, may or may not, the presence or absence\nAll the lexical bundles extracted from the Computational Linguistics' Academic Literature corpus\nhave been analyzed and put in categories.\n3.3 function of lexical bundles\nLexical bundles differ in function and therefore as Hyland 2008 categorized them into two\nfunctions and 7 sub categories. These sub categories include: Location, Procedure, Quantification, Description, Topic, Transitioning, Resulting, structuring, framing, stance and engagement.\nStructuring in terms of their, of the fact that, from the fact that, on the use of, should be noted that, in a variety of, Framing the extent to which, it should be noted, the degree to which, in a way that, should be noted that, as a set of,\nParticipant oriented Stance is an example of, that can be used, this is going to\nengagement so i'm going to, can be seen in, we would like to, so we're going to, and we're going to,\nResearch oriented bundles mostly help writers to structure their ideas and findings. This category\nconsists of several sub-categories that can be explained as follow:\nLocation: location bundles indicate to a particular time and place.\nAnd it's only ever seen at the end of a sequence\nIn this section we focus on some of the\nContain discourse information and at the same time offer repetitions of syllables\nProcedure: Procedure lexical bundles show how a something is done\nQuantification: these bundles talk about numbers and chunks\nDescription: these bundles try to explain\nTopic: these bundles refer to specific topics\nText oriented Lexical Bundles help organizing text and it's message these bundles include:\nTransitioning: these bundles show a transiton in the text\nResulting: these bundles show a resultative sentece\nstructuring: these bundles are for structuring the text\nframing: the bundles are for framing the writing\nParticipant oriented bundles are mostly concerned with the engagement of the reader or the writer.\nstance: giving an example\nengagement: to engage the reader\nthe most frequent category in Computational Linguistics is the framing which indicates that most\nbundles are used in textual forms rather than topic specific bundles.\n4.0 References\n Biber, Douglas, and Susan Conrad. \"Lexical bundles in conversation and\nacademic prose.\" Language and Computers 26 (1999): 181-190.\n Biber, Douglas, Stig Johansson, Geoffrey Leech, Susan Conrad, Edward\nFinegan, and Randolph Quirk.

Corpus linguistics helps language teaching for acquiring a better view for language. Language teachers will know what sequence of words and patters tend to co-occur. Unlike previous enormous lists of words which students were forced to memorize them, and were seldom used and typically were forgotten in a short period of time lexical bundles can help language teachers to teach more effectively, and learners can be more fluent in the second language. The first studies in lexical bundles include Firth 1964 (Firth, J. R. (1964).) Biber (2004), (Cortes, V. (2004). Native speakers use a formulaic pattern of speech which they are unaware of but learners from other languages use bundles that are affected (transferred) bye their mother tongue and this solely can be problematic and easily recognizable. moreover in academia, when speakers of source language trying to write, publish, and produce academic literature in the target language their lack the fluency and native like features of a native speaker of that language. Lexical bundles (or as called N-grams) are crucial in getting a fluent academic text. In this paper lexical bundles of 1 to 5 tokens from an 8 million word corpus of academic literature from the Computational Linguistics field and its sub topics such as: Speech recognition, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Information Retrieval have been extracted and analyzed. On the top of that most of typical criteria for exclusion has been applied to the list as well as calculating MI factor for each result to confirm the results and reaching the target bundles for Computational Linguistics.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
