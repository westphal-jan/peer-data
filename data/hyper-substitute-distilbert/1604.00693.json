The most prominent approach in argumentation models is probably the abstract argumentation framework (AAF) by Dung [24]. In AAF, the contents of the arguments are abstracted from and the framework can be represented as a directed graph in which nodes represent arguments (a set A), and arcs between these nodes represent binary defeat relations (denoted as \u21c0) over them.\nAn important question is which arguments to accept. In his seminal paper, Dung has defined extension-based semantics which correspond to different criteria of acceptability of arguments. For example, if we have two arguments that defeat each other, we cannot accept both. We may accept only one of them. Another equivalent labeling-based semantics is proposed by Caminada [18, 14]. Using this approach, an argument is labeled in (i.e. accepted), out (i.e. rejected), or undec (i.e. undecided).\nOne of the essential properties, that is common, is the condition of admissibility: that accepted arguments must not attack one another, and must defend themselves against counter-arguments, by attacking them back. A stronger notion is called completeness, and is captured, in terms of labelings, in the following two conditions:\n1. An argument is labeled accepted (or in) if and only if all its defeaters are rejected (or out).\n2. An argument is labeled rejected (or out) if and only if at least one of its defeaters is accepted (or in).\nIn all other cases, an argument should be labeled undecided (or undec). Thus, evaluating a set of arguments amounts to labeling each argument using a labeling function L : A\u2192{in,out,undec} to capture these three possible labels. Any labeling that satisfies the above conditions is a legal labeling, and corresponds to a complete labeling (to be discussed in more detail below). Every complete (i.e. legal) labeling represents a consistent self-defending point of view. We will use legal labeling and complete labeling interchangably.\nSince there can be different reasonable positions regarding the evaluation of an argumentation graph, choosing one legal labeling above another is not a trivial task. Therefore, in a multi-agent setting, different agents can subscribe to different positions. Hence, a group of agents with an argumentation graph would need to find a collective labeling that best reflects the opinion of the group. Consider the following example which is depicted in Figure 1.\nExample 1 (A Murder Case). A murder case is under investigation. There is an argument that the suspect is innocent, which suggests that he should be set free (A). However, there is some evidence that the suspect was at the crime scene during the crime time, which suggests that the suspect is not innocent (B). Weirdly enough, a witness confirmed that she saw someone who looks like the suspect in a bar during the crime time, which suggests that the suspect is innocent (C).\nClearly, B and C defeat each other since they support negating conclusions. Also, B defeats A since it provides enough evidence to nullify it.\nA team of four jurors has been assigned to decide on this case. They have been provided with the previous information. Figure 1 shows the three possible legal labelings. Each juror\u2019s judgment can correspond to only one of these labelings. Suppose they voted as shown in Figure 1 (the four thumbs-ups), what would be a labeling that best reflects the opinion of the team?\nDespite the apparent simplicity of the problem, the aggregation of individual evaluations can result into an inconsistent group outcome i.e. even when each individual submits a legal labeling, the aggregation outcome might not be a legal labeling. This problem of aggregating labelings can be compared to preference aggregation (PA) [1, 2, 26, 45], judgment aggregation (JA) [33, 31, 32, 30], and non-binary judgment aggregation [22, 23]. These areas have so far blossomed around impossibility results. There exist many differences between labelings and preference relations stemming from their corresponding order-theoretic characterizations. Labeling aggregation differ from JA in that arguments (which are the counterparts of propositions) can have three values instead of two traditionally considered in JA. Considering the general framework in [23], our settings can be considered as focusing on special classes of feasible evaluations, which are the conditions imposed by the legal labelling (or other semantics). Additionally, the possible evaluations of each issue (argument, in our case) are to accept (labels as in), reject (labels as out), or be undecided (labels as undec). However, translation of results between labeling aggregation and non-binary JA amounts to encoding argument semantics in propositional logic, which is not a trivial task [5, 6].\nRecently, the problem of aggregating valid labelings has been the topic of some studies [42, 3, 15, 9, 11]. In [42, 3], the argument-wise plurality rule (AWPR) which chooses the collective label of each argument by plurality, independently from other arguments, was defined and analyzed. On the other hand, Caminada and Pigozzi [15] showed how judgment aggregation concepts can be applied to formal argumentation in a different way. They proposed three possible operators for aggregating labelings, namely the skeptical operator, the credulous operator, and the super credulous operator. These operators guarantee not only a well-formed outcome but also a compatible one, that is, it does not go against the judgment of any individual.\nIn order to assess the three operators, we assume that individuals have preferences over the outcomes. Although the outcomes of the three aggregation operators proposed in [15] are compatible\nwith every individual\u2019s labeling, this does not mean that they are the most desirable given individuals\u2019 preferences. It is possible that other compatible labelings are more desirable. Moreover, it is possible that some agents submit an insincere opinion in order to get more desirable outcomes. Given that, it is interesting to study the following two questions:\n1. Are the social outcomes of the aggregation operators in [15] Pareto optimal if preferences between different outcomes are also taken into consideration?\n2. How robust are these operators against strategic manipulation? And what are the effects of strategic manipulation from the perspective of social welfare?\nThe first question studies the Pareto optimality of the outcomes of these operators. A Pareto optimal outcome (given individuals preferences) cannot be replaced with another outcome that is more preferred by all individuals and is strictly more preferred by at least one individual. Pareto optimality is a fundamental concept in any social choice setting and a clearly desirable property for any aggregation operator.\nThe second question studies the strategy proofness of the operators. Strategy proofness is fundamental in any realistic multi-agent setting. A strategy-proof operator is one that produces outcomes where individuals have no incentive to misrepresent their votes (i.e. to lie). Unfortunately, as we will see later, most strategy proofness results for the three operators are negative. However, we show later that lies do not always have bad effects on other agents.\nOne can realize that individuals\u2019 preferences (over all the labelings) play a vital role in answering the previous two questions. However, aggregation operators usually do not give the chance for individuals to disclose these preferences. The labeling an agent submits is the only information available about agent\u2019s preferences. It seems a natural choice to assume that the submitted labeling is the most preferred one according to agents\u2019 individual preference. Moreover we assume that the rest of agent\u2019s preferences can be modeled using distance from the most preferred one. For example, if the top preferred outcome for agent i is the outcome O1 (i.e. \u2200O j, O1 i O j), then O2 i O3 iff dist(O1,O2) < dist(O1,O3) where dist(O1,O2) is the distance between the two outcomes O1 and O2.\nIn this work, we investigate different classes of preferences based on different distance measures, and use them to analyze the three aggregation operators proposed in [15] with respect to the aforementioned two questions.\nThis paper makes three distinct contributions. First, it introduces the first thorough study of Pareto optimality and strategy proofness for aggregation operators in the context of argumentation. In doing so, the paper highlights that considering argumentation in multi-agent conflict resolution calls for criteria other than logical consistency such as social optimality and strategic manipulation.\nSecond, the paper introduces different families of agents\u2019 preferences. Building on the new concept of issue, proposed by Booth et al. [10], we define a new class of agents preferences. We also define a new class of preferences which consider the label undec as a middle label between in and out. These new families of preferences capture the intuitions, are more natural, and broaden the scope of analysis of preferences.\nThe third contribution of this paper is establishing relations between the different classes of preferences. Some of these relations hold for any aggregation operator and others for some special\naggregation operators. Additionally, we provide a full comparison for three previously introduced labeling aggregation operators with respect to the proposed classes of preferences. Moreover, we also consider cases where agents do not share the same classes of preference. Our results are based on two fundamental criteria, namely Pareto optimality and strategy proofness. For most classes of preferences we establish the superiority of the skeptical operator. However, we also characterize situations where the credulous and super credulous operators are as good as the skeptical operator. This highlights a trade-off between the two criteria on one hand, and seeking more committed outcomes on the other hand.\nOur results bridge a gap in our understanding of the social optimality and strategic manipulation of labeling aggregation operators. As for the Pareto optimality, we show the persistence of the superiority of the skeptical operator. However, there are situations where the credulous and super credulous operators are as good as the skeptical operator. This has an implication on the choice of the appropriate aggregation operator given the criteria that is considered more important, as well as, the nature of agents preferences.\nAs for the strategy proofness, we establish the fragility of the three operators against strategic manipulation. This negative result is consistent even for a wide range of individual agent preference criteria (except for two cases). This highlights a major limitation of these otherwise attractive approaches to collective argument evaluation.\nDespite the negative results, our results show that lies with the skeptical operator are always benevolent i.e. every strategic lie by an agent does not hurt others, but rather improves their welfare. Furthermore, we show that this effect is surprisingly consistent for a wide range of individual agent preference criteria. This shows an important advantage for such an approach to labeling aggregation.1"}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "2.1 Abstract Argumentation Framework (AAF).2\nThe seminal paper by Dung [24] introduced the fundamental notion of abstract argumentation framework that can be represented as a directed graph where the vertices represent arguments (ignoring details about their contents) and the directed arcs represent the defeat relations between these arguments.3 For example, in Figure 2, argument A1 is defeated by arguments A2 and A4 which are, in turn, defeated by arguments A3 and A5.\nDefinition 1 (Argumentation framework [24]). An argumentation framework is a pair AF= \u3008A,\u21c0 \u3009 where A is a finite set of arguments and \u21c0\u2286A\u00d7A is a defeat relation. We say that an argument A defeats an argument B if (A,B) \u2208\u21c0 (sometimes written A \u21c0 B).\nThere are two approaches to define semantics that assess the acceptability of arguments. One of them is extension-based semantics by Dung [24], which produces a set of arguments that are\n1Part of the results of this paper have been presented in [16]. 2Readers familiar with AAF can skip this part. 3We will use \u201cargumentation graph\u201d and \u201cargumentation framework\u201d interchangeably.\naccepted together. Another equivalent labeling-based semantics is proposed by Caminada [18, 14], which gives a labeling for each argument. With argument labelings, we can accept arguments (by labeling them as in), reject arguments (by labeling them as out), and abstain from deciding whether to accept or reject (by labeling them as undec). As [15] employed the labeling approach, so we continue to use it here.\nDefinition 2 (Argument labeling [18, 14]). Let AF= \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009 be an argumentation framework. An argument labeling is a total function L : A\u2192{in,out,undec}.\nFor the purposes of this paper, we use the following marking convention, as shown in Figure 3, arguments labeled in are shown in white, out in black, and undec in gray.\nWe write in(L) for the set of arguments that are labeled in by L, out(L) for the set of arguments that are labeled out by L, and undec(L) for the set of arguments that are labeled undec by L. A labeling L can be represented as L = (in(L),out(L),undec(L)). Equivalently, we also denote a labeling L as: L= {(A, l)| L(A) = l for all A \u2208A, l \u2208 {in,out,undec}}.\nHowever, labelings should follow some given conditions. If an argument is labeled in then all of its defeaters are labeled out. If an argument is labeled out then at least one of its defeaters is labeled in. We call a labeling that follows the previous two conditions an admissible labeling.\nDefinition 3 (Admissible labeling [18, 14]). Let AF = \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009 be an argumentation framework. An admissible labeling is a mapping L : A\u2192 {in,out,undec} such that for each A \u2208 A it holds that:\nif L(A) = in then \u2200B\u2208A : (B \u21c0 A\u21d2 L(B) = out), and if L(A) = out then \u2203B\u2208A : (B \u21c0 A \u2227 L(B) = in).\nSome examples for admissible labelings, in Figure 2, can include the following: ({A1,A3,A5}, {A2,A4}, /0), ({A3,A5}, {A2,A4}, {A1}), ({A3}, {A2}, {A1,A4,A5}), ({A5}, /0, {A1,A2,A3,A4}), and ( /0, /0, {A1,A2,A3,A4,A5}).\nOne can realize that in an admissible labeling, unlike in-labeled and out-labeled arguments, undec-labels do not need to be justified i.e. an argument can be labeled undec under an admissible labeling without any condition.\nThe complete semantics, however, force undec-labels to be also justified. A complete labeling is an admissible labeling with the following extra condition: If an argument is labeled undec then there is no defeating argument that is labeled in (that is, there is insufficient ground to label the argument out) and not all defeating arguments are labeled out (that is, there is insufficient ground to label the argument in). We call a labeling which follows these rules a complete labeling.\nDefinition 4 (Complete labeling [18, 14]). Let AF = \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009 be an argumentation framework. A complete labeling is a mapping L : A\u2192{in,out,undec} such that for each A \u2208A it holds that:\nif L(A) = in then \u2200B\u2208A : (B \u21c0 A\u21d2 L(B) = out), if L(A) = out then \u2203B\u2208A : (B \u21c0 A \u2227 L(B) = in), and if L(A) = undec then: \u00ac[\u2200B\u2208A : (B \u21c0 A\u21d2 L(B) = out)]\u2227\u00ac[\u2203B\u2208A : (B \u21c0 A \u2227 L(B) = in)]\nAs an example for a complete labeling, in Figure 2, we have only one complete labeling, namely ({A1,A3,A5}, {A2,A4}, /0)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Aggregation Operators", "text": "Perhaps, the most common aggregation rules are the majority rules, in which an alternative is chosen if and only if it receives a number of votes that exceeds some presepecified threshold k > 0.5\u00d7N, where N is the number of voters. However, these rules are not always appropriate. One example is in juries, when the legal or the moral responsibility of the outcome is shared by all individuals. Indeed Ronnegard [43] argued that the attribution of moral responsibility to all members of a committee is legitimate when the decision is taken through unanimous voting, while it is not necessarily the case otherwise. Another example is when the outcome of the decision can potentially harm some individuals. It was shown in [8] that people show a preference for more conservative aggregation procedures when the outcome of the decision may involve the infliction of personal harm. Aiming to address such specific scenarios, Caminada and Pigozzi [15] proposed three aggregation rules that ensure the compatibility of the outcome with all individuals votes.\nBefore introducing the aggregation operators that were defined in [15], we first define the problem of aggregation. The problem of labeling aggregation can be formulated as a set of individuals that collectively decide how an argumentation framework AF = \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009 must be labelled.\nDefinition 5 (Labeling aggregation problem [3]). Let Ag = {1, . . . ,n} be a finite non-empty set of agents, and AF = \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009 be an argumentation framework. A labeling aggregation problem is a pair LAP= \u3008Ag,AF\u3009.\nEach individual i \u2208 Ag has a labeling Li which expresses the evaluation of AF by this individual. A labeling profile P is a set of the labelings submitted by agents in Ag: P = {L1, . . . ,Ln}.4\n4We follow [15] in assuming that the profile is a set of labelings instead of a list of labelings. Although this is not common in judgment aggregation literature where the number of votes matter in many operators, it is not the case for the three operators considered in this study, since they focus on compatibility instead of cardinality. As such, although we list n labelings in the profile, it is possible that a profile has less than n elements, since agents can submit similar labelings.\nA labeling aggregation operator is a function that maps a set of n labelings, chosen from the set of all labelings, Labs, into a collective labeling.5\nDefinition 6 (Labeling aggregation operator OAF [15]). Let LAP= \u3008Ag,AF\u3009 be a labeling aggregation problem. A labeling aggregation operator for LAP is a function OAF : 2Labs \\{ /0}\u2192 Labs such that OAF({L1, . . . ,Ln}) = LColl , where LColl is the collective labeling.\nA labeling L1 is said to be less or equally committed than another labeling L2 if and only if every argument that is labeled in by L1 is also labeled in by L2 and every argument that is labeled out by L1 is also labeled out by L2.\nDefinition 7 (Less or equally committed v [15]). Let L1 and L2 be two labelings of argumentation framework AF = \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009. We say that L1 is less or equally committed as L2 (L1 v L2) iff (in(L1)\u2286 in(L2))\u2227 (out(L1)\u2286 out(L2)).\nTwo labelings L1 and L2 are said to be compatible with each other if and only if for every argument, there is no in\u2212 out conflict between the two. In other words, every argument that is labeled in by L1 is not labeled out by L2 and every argument that is labeled out by L1 is not labeled in by L2.\nDefinition 8 (Compatible labelings \u2248 [15]). Let L1 and L2 be two labelings of argumentation framework AF= \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009. We say that L1 is compatible with L2 (L1\u2248L2) iff (in(L1)\u2229out(L2)= /0)\u2227 (out(L1)\u2229in(L2) = /0)\nWe now define a compatible operator as the following:\nDefinition 9 (Compatible operator). Let LAP= \u3008Ag,AF\u3009 be a labeling aggregation problem, and let OAF be a labeling aggregation operator for LAP. We say OAF is a compatible operator if given any labeling profile P = {L1, . . . ,Ln}, OAF(P) \u2248 Li,\u2200i \u2208 Ag i.e. the outcome of OAF is compatible with each individual\u2019s labeling.\nIn [15], Caminada and Pigozzi proposed three different aggregation operators, namely the skeptical operator, the credulous operator and the super credulous operator. Each of these operators maps a set of labelings, that are submitted by individuals, into a collective labeling. The following two definitions are used in the definition of these operators:\nDefinition 10 (Initial operators u, t [15]). Let LAP= \u3008Ag,AF\u3009 be a labeling aggregation problem. The skeptical initial u and credulous initial t operators are labeling aggregation operators for LAP defined as the following:\n\u2022 u({L1, . . . ,Ln}) = {(A,in)|\u2200i \u2208 Ag : Li(A) = in} \u222a {(A,out)|\u2200i \u2208 Ag : Li(A) = out} \u222a {(A,undec)|\u2203i \u2208 Ag : Li(A) 6= in\u2227\u2203 j \u2208 Ag : L j(A) 6= out}\n5Although it would be more precise to use LabsSAF to denote the set of all labelings for AF= \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009 according to semantics S, we will often drop AF and S, and use Labs instead when there is no ambiguity about the argumentation framework. The same goes for all other notations (e.g. OAF) that were defined for an AF, when there is no ambiguity about the argumentation framework.\n\u2022 t({L1, . . . ,Ln})= {(A,in)|\u2203i\u2208Ag :Li(A)= in\u2227\u00ac\u2203 j\u2208Ag :L j(A)= out} \u222a {(A,out)|\u2203i\u2208 Ag : Li(A) = out\u2227\u00ac\u2203 j \u2208 Ag : L j(A) = in} \u222a {(A,undec)|\u2200i \u2208 Ag : Li(A) = undec\u2228 (\u2203 j \u2208 Ag : L j(A) = in\u2227\u2203k \u2208 Ag : Lk(A) = out)} 6\nDefinition 11 (Down-admissible \u2193 and up-complete \u2191 labelings [15]). Let L be a labeling of argumentation framework AF = \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009. The down-admissible labeling of L, denoted as L\u2193, is the biggest element of the set of all admissible labelings that are less or equally committed than L:\n\u2200L\u2032 \u2208 Adms : (L\u2032 v L\u21d2 L\u2032 v (L \u2193)v L)\nwhere Adms is the set of all admissible labelings for AF. The up-complete labeling of L, denoted as L\u2191, is the smallest element of the set of all complete labelings that are bigger or equally committed than L.\n\u2200L\u2032 \u2208 Comps : (Lv L\u2032\u21d2 Lv (L \u2191)v L\u2032)\nNow, we provide the definitions of the three operators:\nDefinition 12 (Skeptical soAF, Credulous coAF and Super Credulous scoAF operators [15]). Let LAP = \u3008Ag,AF\u3009 be a labeling aggregation problem. The skeptical soAF, the credulous coAF and super credulous scoAF operators are labeling aggregation operators for LAP defined as the following:\n\u2022 soAF({L1, . . . ,Ln}) = (u({L1, . . . ,Ln})) \u2193.\n\u2022 coAF({L1, . . . ,Ln}) = (t({L1, . . . ,Ln})) \u2193.\n\u2022 scoAF({L1, . . . ,Ln}) = ((t({L1, . . . ,Ln})) \u2193) \u2191.\nGiven the set of all admissible labelings Adms for some argumentation framework, it is shown that the outcome of the skeptical aggregation operator is the biggest element in Adms that is less or equally committed to every individual\u2019s labeling.\nTheorem 1 ([15]). Let L1, . . . ,Ln (n\u2265 1) be labelings of argumentation framework AF= \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009. Let LSO be soAF({L1, . . . ,Ln}). It holds that LSO is the biggest admissible labeling such that for every i \u2208 Ag : LSO v Li."}, {"heading": "2.3 Distance Measures", "text": "In this part, we define the family of distance measures that we use to define preferences. Each of the distance measures we consider is characterized by three choices:\n\u2022 Individual arguments vs. Issues (set of arguments).\n\u2022 Set inclusion vs. Quantitative distance.\n\u2022 Uniform vs. undec in the middle. 6We will often use sioAF and cioAF to refer to the skeptical initial and credulous initial operators, respectively.\nThe combination of all of these choices produces eight different distance measures. We start from the third choice. The uniform vs. undec in the middle choice captures the intuition that the distance between accepting an argument (in) and rejecting it (out) may be set as equal or superior to the distance of accepting (or rejecting) an argument (in or out) and abstaining on the same argument (undec). In other words, an in/out disagreement may be as serious or more serious (depending on the contexts) than a in/undec (or a out/undec) disagreement.\nThus, we consider the following two cases. First, in, out, and undec are equally distant from each other. In other words, dist(in,out) = dist(dec,undec), where dist(.) is the difference between two labels for one argument, and dec is either in or out. In the other case, we assume that undec is in the middle between in and out. Thus, we differentiate between two types of disagreement. One between in and out, and the other between dec and undec. When considering distance, we assume dist(in,out)> dist(dec,undec).\n2.3.1 Case 1: in, out, and undec are Equally Distant from Each Other\nHamming Set and Hamming Distance The Hamming set between two labelings L1 and L2 is the set of arguments that these two labelings disagree upon.\nDefinition 13 (Hamming Set ). Let L1, L2 be two labelings of AF = \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009. We define the Hamming set between these two labelings as:\nL1 L2 = {A \u2208A|L1(A) 6= L2(A)} (1)\nThe Hamming distance between two labelings L1 and L2 is the number of arguments that these two labelings disagree upon.\nDefinition 14 (Hamming Distance | |). Let L1 and L2 be two labelings of AF = \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009. We define the Hamming distance between these two labelings as:\nL1 | |L2 = |L1 L2| (2)\nIssue-wise Set and Issue-wise Distance. The label of an argument depends on the labels of the defeating arguments. Therefore, measuring the distance by treating arguments independently might not give an accurate sense of how far two labelings are from each other. Consider the example in Figure 4. Using Hamming distance, we have L1 | |L2 = L1 | |L3 = 4.\nHowever, one can argue that L3 is closer (than L2) to L1. Intuitively speaking, if L1 and L3 further agreed on the labeling of C (or D), then they would have been equivalent. On the other hand, L1 and L2 should further agree on E (or F) and G (or H) in order to become equivalent. In other words, the number of arguments whose labelings need to be switched in order to make the two labelings be equivalent is less between L1 and L3 than between L1 and L2.\nMotivated by this example, Booth et al. [10] proposed a new distance method, using the notion of \u201cissue\u201d, which they defined. This distance method captures the idea in the previous example,\nwhile satisfying a set of axiomatic properties which they listed as essential for any distance measure.\nCrucial to the definition of the \u201cissue\u201d is the concept of \u201cin-sync\u201d. We say that two arguments A and B are in-sync if for any pair of labelings L,L\u2032 \u2208 Labs, L(A) cannot be changed to L\u2032(A) without causing a change of equal magnitude when moving from L(B) to L\u2032(B), and vice versa.\nDefinition 15 (in-Sync \u2261 for semantics S [10]). Let LabsS be the set of all labelings according to semantics S for argumentation framework AF = \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009. We say that two arguments A,B \u2208A are in-sync for semantics S (A\u2261S B):\nA\u2261S B iff (A\u2261S1 B \u2228 A\u2261S2 B) (3)\nwhere:\n\u2022 A\u2261S1 B iff \u2200L \u2208 LabsS : L(A) = L(B).\n\u2022 A\u2261S2 B iff \u2200L \u2208 LabsS : (L(A) = in\u21d4 L(B) = out) \u2227 (L(A) = out\u21d4 L(B) = in)\nIn-sync is an equivalence relation. We can partition the set of arguments in any argumentation framework AF into the in-sync equivalence classes, which form what is called issues.7\nDefinition 16 (Issue [10]). Given the argumentation framework AF = \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009, a set of arguments B\u2286A is called an issue iff it forms an equivalence class of the relation in-Sync (\u2261).\nThe Issue-wise set between two labelings L1 and L2 is the set of issues that these two labelings disagree upon.\nDefinition 17 (Issue-wise Set W). Let L1, L2 be two labelings of AF = \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009 and let I be the set of all issues in AF. We define the Issue-wise set between these two labelings as:\nL1 WL2 = {B \u2208 I|L1(A) 6= L2(A) for some (equiv. all) A \u2208B} (4) 7The definition of issue, along with all the definitions depending on it, can be defined for semantics S (as the case for \u201cin-sync\u201d). However, from now on, we will restrict all of these definitions to the complete semantics, and drop the letter S. Thus, \u201cissues\u201d in what follows refers to the equivalnce classes of in-sync for the complete semantics.\nNote that the sentence \u201cfor some (equiv. all)\u201d follows from the definition of issues. One can realize that:\n\u2200L1,L2 \u2208 Labs,\u2200B \u2208 I : (\u2203A \u2208B s.t. L1(A) 6= L2(A)\u21d4\u2200A \u2208B : L1(A) 6= L2(A)) (5)\nThe Issue-wise distance between two labelings L1 and L2 is the number of issues that these two labelings disagree upon.\nDefinition 18 (Issue-wise Distance | W|). Let L1, L2 be two labelings of AF= \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009. We define the Issue-wise distance between these two labelings as:\nL1 | W|L2 = |L1 WL2| (6)\nFor example, in Figure 4, the Issue-wise sets between L1 and the other two labellings are:\nL1 WL2 = {{E,F},{G,H}}\nL1 WL3 = {{A,B,C,D}} While the corresponding Issue-wise distances are:\nL1 | W|L2 = |{{E,F},{G,H}}|= 2\nL1 | W|L3 = |{{A,B,C,D}}|= 1\n2.3.2 Case 2: undec is in the Middle between in and out\nIn this section, we consider the case where undec is in the middle between in and out. Thus, we differentiate between two types of disagreement: 1) in/out disagreement, and 2) dec/undec disagreement. When considering distance, we assume dist(in,out) = 2\u00d7 dist(dec,undec) = 2. 8\nTo illustrate the difference from the previous case, consider the example shown in Figure 5. In this example, one can realize that the labelings L2 and L3 are equally distant from labeling L1 when considering Hamming set/distance or Issue-wise set/distance.\nHowever, one can argue that L3 is closer than L2 to L1. Consider the arguments in Figure 5. Labelings L1 and L2 seem to be on completely different sides regarding their evaluations for A and B. On the other hand, the difference between L1 and L3 is less drastic, because L3 abstains from taking any position about A and B.\nWe use IUO (short for In-Undec-Out i.e. Undec is in the middle) to denote this class of preferences.\n8 The use of 2 here is chosen carefully to satisfy the triangle inequality. However, the use of any \u03b1 s.t. 1 < \u03b1 \u2264 2 would not affect the results of this paper. We just use 2 here for simplicity.\nIUO Hamming Sets and IUO Hamming Distance The in\u2212 out Hamming set ( io) between two labelings L1 and L2 is the set of arguments that both labelings label as decided (i.e. in or out), but on which they disagree upon. The dec\u2212undec Hamming set ( du) between two labelings L1 and L2 is the set of arguments that one of the two labelings labels as decided (whether in or out) and the other labels as undecided.\nDefinition 19 (IUO Hamming sets M). Let L1, L2 be two labelings of AF = \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009. We define the IUO Hamming sets as a pair M = ( io, du), where io is in\u2212out Hamming set and du is dec\u2212undec Hamming set:\nL1 io L2 = {A \u2208A|(L1(A) = in\u2227L2(A) = out)\u2228 (L1(A) = out\u2227L2(A) = in)} (7)\nL1 du L2 = {A \u2208A|(A \u2208 dec(L1)\u2227L2(A) = undec)\u2228 (L1(A) = undec\u2227A \u2208 dec(L2))} (8)\nwhere dec(L1) is the set of decided (in or out) arguments according to the labeling L1.\nThe IUO Hamming distance between two labelings L1 and L2 is the number of arguments in L1 du L2 added to twice the number of the arguments in L1 io L2.\nDefinition 20 (IUO Hamming Distance \u2223\u2223 M\u2223\u2223). Let L1, L2 be two labelings of AF = \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009. We define the IUO Hamming distance between these two labelings as:\nL1 \u2223\u2223\u2223 M\u2223\u2223\u2223L2 = 2\u00d7|L1 io L2|+ |L1 du L2| (9) IUO Issue-wise Sets and IUO Issue-wise Distance The in\u2212out Issue-wise set ( ioW) between two labelings L1 and L2 is the set of issues that both of the two labelings label as decided, but on which they disagree upon. The dec\u2212undec Issue-wise set ( duW) between two labelings L1 and L2 is the set of issues that one of the two labelings labels as decided and the other labels as undecided.\nDefinition 21 (IUO Issue-wise sets MW). Let L1, L2 be two labelings of AF = \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009 and let I be the set of all issues in AF. We define the IUO Issue-wise sets as MW = ( ioW, duW), where ioW is the in\u2212out Issue-wise set and duW is the dec\u2212undec Issue-wise set:\nL1 ioWL2 = {B \u2208 I|(L1(A) = in\u2227L2(A) = out)\u2228 (L1(A) = out\u2227L2(A) = in) for some (equiv. all) A \u2208B} (10)\nL1 duW L2 = {B \u2208 I|(A \u2208 dec(L1)\u2227L2(A) = undec)\u2228 (L1(A) = undec\u2227A \u2208 dec(L2)) for some (equiv. all) A \u2208B} (11)\nNote that given the definition of issues, for every labeling L, an issue is either decided (all arguments in it are labeled in or out by L) or undecided (all arguments in it are labeled undecided by L):\n\u2200L \u2208 Labs,\u2200B \u2208 I : (\u2203A \u2208B s.t.

Let L1, L2 be two labelings of AF = \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009.

We say an agent\u2019s preferences are x-based, if her preferences are calculated using the distance measure x (e.g. Hamming distance based preferences). We use i,x to denote a weak preference relation by agent i whose preferences are x-based i.e. for any pair L1,L2 \u2208 Labs, L1 i,x L2 denotes that L1 is more or equally preferred than L2 by agent i with x-based preferences. Further, we use i,x to denote a strict preference relation (L1 i,x L2 iff (L1 i,x L2)\u2227\u00ac(L2 i,x L1)), \u223c to denote an incomparability relation (L1 \u223ci,x L2 iff \u00ac(L1 i,x L2)\u2227\u00ac(L2 i,x L1)), and \u223c= to denote an indifference relation (L1 \u223c=i,x L2 iff (L1 i,x L2)\u2227 (L2 i,x L1)).\nWe define the subset relation over pairs of sets as the following.\nDefinition 23 (Subset Over Pairs \u2286).

Note that the set based preference yields a partial order over the labelings.9\nDefinition 24 (Set Based Preference i,\u2297). We say that agent i\u2019s preferences are\u2297-set based w.r.t Li iff:\n\u2200L,L\u2032 \u2208 Labs : L i,\u2297 L\u2032\u21d4 L\u2297Li \u2286 L\u2032\u2297Li (15)\nwhere Li is agent i\u2019s most preferred labeling and \u2297 \u2208 { , M, W, MW}.

Note that the distance based preference yields a total pre-order over the labelings.\n9Although formally, the set-based criteria are not measures but mappings to sets, we will slightly abuse terminology and refer to all criteria (set based and distance based) as set and distance measures for easy reference.\nWe now define the classes of preferences which are based on different distance measures, that we defined earlier.\nDefinition 25 (Distance Based Preference i,|\u2297|). We say that agent i\u2019s preferences are |\u2297|- distance based w.r.t Li iff:\n\u2200L,L\u2032 \u2208 Labs : L i,|\u2297| L\u2032\u21d4 L |\u2297|Li \u2264 L\u2032 |\u2297|Li (16)\nwhere Li is agent i\u2019s most preferred labeling and |\u2297| \u2208 {| | , \u2223\u2223 M\u2223\u2223 , | W| , \u2223\u2223 MW\u2223\u2223}. Note that |\u2297|- distance based preferences is read Hamming distance based preferences when |\u2297| = | |, Issuewise distance based preferences when |\u2297|= | W|, . . .etc.\nTo illustrate the set and distance based preferences, we use Hamming set and Hamming distance based preferences for their simplicity. Consider the example in Figure 6 with four possible complete labelings. The Hamming sets between L1 and the other three labelings are:\nL1 L2 = {A,B}\nL1 L3 = {C,D,E} L1 L4 = {A,B,C,D,E}\nConsequently, the Hamming distance values between L1 and the other three labelings are the cardinality values of the Hamming sets between L1 and the other three labelings.\nL1 | |L2 = |{A,B}|= 2 L1 | |L3 = |{C,D,E}|= 3\nL1 | |L4 = |{A,B,C,D,E}|= 5 Assume we have agents with Hamming set based preferences. Hence, an arbitrary agent i who prefers L1 the most, would have the following preferences: L1 L2 L4 and L1 L3 L4 (neither L1 L2 nor L1 L3 is a subset of the other). However, if agents have Hamming distance based preferences, an agent who prefers L1 the most, would have the following preferences: L1 L2 L3 L4.\nWe can now examine the examples in Figure 4 and 5 in the light of preferences. The example in Figure 4 shows how an agent i whose top preference is Li = L1 would have different opinions about other labelings given the different distance measures used. If agent i has Hamming distance based preferences, then:\nL1 | |L2 = |{E,F,G,H}|= 4 L1 | |L3 = |{A,B,C,D}|= 4\nthen, her preferences would be L1 i,| | L2 \u223c=i,| | L3, while if she has Issue-wise distance based preferences, then:\nL1 | W|L2 = |{{E,F},{G,H}}|= 2 L1 | W|L3 = |{{A,B,C,D}}|= 1\nthen, her preferences would be L1 i,| W| L3 i,| W| L2. Hence, it is interesting to introduce the \u201cIssue-wise\u201d concept to define a new class of preferences.\nThe example in Figure 5 shows how an agent i (whose top preference is L1) would have different preferences depending on whether in, out, and undec are equally distant, or undec is in the middle between in and out. In the former case:\nL1 | |L2 = |{A,B}|= 2\nL1 | |L3 = |{A,B}|= 2 and\nL1 | W|L2 = |{{A,B}}|= 1 L1 | W|L3 = |{{A,B}}|= 1\nhence, L1 i,| | L2 \u223c=i,| | L3 and L1 i,| W| L2 \u223c=i,| W| L3. In the latter case:\nL1 \u2223\u2223\u2223 M\u2223\u2223\u2223L2 = 2\u00d7|{A,B}|+0 = 4 L1\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 M\u2223\u2223\u2223L3 = 2\u00d70+ |{A,B}|= 2 and\nL1 \u2223\u2223\u2223 MW\u2223\u2223\u2223L2 = 2\u00d7|{{A,B}}|+0 = 2 L1\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 MW\u2223\u2223\u2223L3 = 2\u00d70+ |{{A,B}}|= 1 hence, L1 i,| M| L3 i,| M| L2 and L1 i,| MW| L3 i,| MW| L2.

We say that the set of agents Ag have homogeneous preferences from R if \u2200i, j \u2208 Ag : c(i) = c( j) \u2208 R.

In general, if a labeling L is Pareto optimal in a set S given that Ag have homogeneous preferences from R, then L might not be Pareto optimal if Ag have heterogeneous preferences from R (see Example 3 in the Appendix).\nHowever, one can show that some of the classes of preferences that we defined enjoy special relations with each others that make Pareto optimality carry over from homogeneous preference of each of those classes to heterogeneous preferences that combine all of those classes. Consider the following theorem.\nTheorem 10.

We show here even a stronger result, that is even when agents preferences are hererogenous, and no matter what the combination of classes of preferences that they have, the skeptical operator sustains Pareto optimality.

A labeling L\u2032k such that Op(PLk/L\u2032k) k Op(P) is called a strategic lie.

An aggregation operator Op is strategy proof if strategic lies are not possible.\nDespite the fact that, as we shall see, for most classes of preference, the aggregation operators turned out to be vulnerable to strategic manipulation, a novel type of lie emerged: the benevolent lie. Unlike the malicious lie, the benevolent lie has positive effects on some of the other agents and no negative effects on any agent.\nDefinition 31 (Malicious lie).

Consider the skeptical aggregation operator and Hamming set based preferences. For any agent, her strategic lies are benevolent.\nTheorem 15. Consider the skeptical aggregation operator and Hamming distance based preferences. For any agent, her strategic lies are benevolent.\nNote that the previous two theorems raise an interesting point. Given the Pareto optimality of the skeptical operator for Hamming set/distance based preferences, one would expect that benevolent lies are not possible. Otherwise, it means there exists another labeling that is more preferred by every agent and strictly preferred by at lease one agent. This contradicts the Pareto optimality result found earlier.\nHowever, it is important to remember that the Pareto optimality results found earlier are all with respect to the sets of labelings that are smaller or equal (or compatible in the case of the other operators) to each individuals\u2019 labelings. On the other hand, an outcome given a benevolent lie is not compatible with every individual\u2019s labeling i.e. while the skeptical operator does produce labelings that are compatible with each individual\u2019s true labeling, it does so for the submitted labelings only. Hence, when an agent k lies and submits L\u2032k instead of Lk, the outcome L \u2032 SO (which is the outcome when k submits L\u2032k) is compatible with L \u2032 k but not necessarily to Lk. As a result, the labeling L\u2032SO does not belong to the set of labelings that LSO is compared to when studying Pareto optimality.\nThis highlights another interesting point that can be implied by the benevolence and Pareto optimality of the skeptical operator. When using the skeptical operator, whenever an agent k considers lying in order to get a closer labeling to Lk, she is faced with an inevitable trade-off between getting a less or equally committed outcome and getting a closer (i.e. more preferred) outcome."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Issue-wise Set and Issue-wise Distance", "text": "Similar to the Hamming based preferences, none of the three operators is strategy proof given Issue-wise set (resp.

Two key criteria are Pareto optimality and strategy proofness, which are fundamental in any social choice and multi-agent setting. In this study, we have analyzed and compared three\naggregation operators, namely the skeptical, the credulous and the super credulous operators with respect to a wide range of classes of preferences. Our comparison is based on two fundamental criteria, namely Pareto optimality and strategy proofness. Eight different classes of preferences were considered by using eight different distance methods. Additionally, we established relations between the different classes of preferences. Some of these relations hold for any aggregation operator and others for some special aggregation operators. Moreover, we also consider cases where agents do not share the same classes of preference.\nWe showed that the skeptical operator guarantees Pareto optimal outcomes given all the different classes of preferences, while the credulous and super credulous operators only guarantee Pareto optimal outcomes given the set-based preferences. Since more committed outcomes might be more desirable in general, credulous and super credulous operators will be preferable if individuals\u2019 preferences are known to be set-based. However, if the individuals preferences are unknown or are known to be distance-based, then there is a trade-off between Pareto optimality and the more committed outcomes. As for the strategy proofness, the three operators are vulnerable to manipulation given most classes of preferences. However, the skeptical operator guarantees benevolent lies. Understandably, unlike malicious lies, benevolent ones are not harmful to the group. Hence, there is another trade-off in choosing an appropriate operator between avoiding the malicious lies and choosing the more committed outcomes.\nFew studies have considered Pareto optimality and strategy proofness with argument based aggregation. Rahwan and Larson [39] defined a set of simplistic agents preferences over argumentation outcomes, and studied the Pareto optimality of different argument evaluation rules defined using classical semantics (e.g. complete,...etc.) given agents with these simple types of preferences. Unlike Rahwan and Larson, we study the Pareto optimality of labeling aggregation operators that produce a collective evaluation given many different evaluations. Another difference is that we consider more realistic, distance-based preferences. As for strategy proofness, since the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem [27, 44], much research has been done towards analyzing strategic manipulation of preference aggregation (PA) rules [28, 29, 35, 19, 36, 25]. Strategy proofness of judgment aggregation (JA) operators have been first studied by Dietrich and List [20, 21]. In the former, Dietrich mentioned some independence conditions that make the rule strategy proof. In the latter, Dietrich and List showed equivalence between satisfying strategy proofness and satisfying both the independence and monotonicity postulates.\nThe first study of strategy proofness of labeling aggregation operator has been done by Rahwan and Tohme\u0301 [42] in the context of a specific labeling aggregation operator (argument-wise plurality rule). They showed the strategy proofness of this operator given agents with a particular class of preferences, dubbed focal set preferences. Our work considers different labeling aggregation operators, and we provide the first broad analysis for strategy proofness of labeling aggregation operators given a wide variety of preferences. Strategic manipulation in argumentation has also been studied by Rahwan, Larson and others [40, 38, 37], when arguments are distributed among agents, and where these agents may choose to show or hide arguments. Thus, that work focuses on how agents contribute to the construction of the argument graph itself, which is then evaluated centrally by the mechanism (e.g. a judge). In contrast, our present paper is concerned with strategic manipulation of labeling aggregation operators which take as input different evaluations of a given\nfixed graph. In fact, the difference between our problem and theirs can be analogized to jury versus litigators. The former are provided with shared information, while the latter propose their information on a dialog basis.\nWe believe that one of the strengths of the argumentation approach is that it is able to provide a dialectical specification of non-monotonic inference. That is, whether or not an argument is accepted (w.r.t. a specific argumentation semantics) can be assessed using dialectical proof procedures. For instance whether an argument is labelled in by the grounded labelling can be assessed using either the Standard Grounded Game [34] or the more recently defined Grounded Persuasion Game [17]. Another example is the Admissibility Game [13] that assesses whether an argument A is in an admissible set (equiv. in a preferred extension or a complete extension). The seminal work by Dung with model-based semantics such as the grounded and preferred semantics laid the building blocks for these games. Likewise, we believe our work and the work of Caminada and Pigozzi [15] lays the building blocks for dialectical preference aggregation by studying the aggregation of opinions using model-based semantics. For instance, by using modified versions of the above mentioned games, one can define a game for the down-admissible operator and a game for the up-complete operator. Then, using these two games, one can provide dialectical proof procedures for each of the JA-operators (skeptical, credulous and super-credulous) studied in this work. The interested reader can refer to the technical report [12] for more details about how the previously mentioned games can be modified to define games for the studied aggregation operators.\nAcknowledgements.

The rest can be rearranged similarly to b), and replacing in(L)\u222aout(L) by dec(L) would give the result.\nWe now prove two lemmas establishing the relations between less or equally committed labelings and Hamming based preferences over labelings.\nLemma 4.

From LvL\u2032, we have that dec(L)\u2286 dec(L\u2032), which is equivalent to undec(L\u2032)\u2286 undec(L) because undec is the complement of dec. From this, it follows that undec(L\u2032)\u2229 dec(Li) \u2286 undec(L)\u2229dec(Li). Since LvLi and L\u2032 vLi (by assumption and transitivity of v), we can use Lemma 3b to obtain L\u2032 Li \u2286 L Li. By definition we have that L\u2032 i, L and L\u2032 i,| | L.\nLemma 5. Let AF= \u3008A,\u21c0\u3009 be an argumentation framework. Let L, L\u2032 and Li be three labelings and let LvLi. If Li is the most preferred labeling of agent i, her preference is Hamming set based and L\u2032 i, L, then Lv L\u2032.\nProof. L\u2032 i, L implies L\u2032 Li \u2286L Li which implies L(A) =Li(A)\u21d2L\u2032(A) =Li(A) for any argument A (i). Now, L v Li implies L(A) = Li(A) for any A \u2208 dec(L) (ii). From (i) and (ii) it follows that L(A) = L\u2032(A) for any A \u2208 dec(L). Hence Lv L\u2032."}, {"heading": "2 Pareto Optimality", "text": "Theorem 2.

Consider Figure 7, let Ag = {1,2} be the set of agents 1 and 2, whose preferred labelings are respectively L1 and L2, and let S= {LCO,LX}. Note the following:\n\u2022 LCO is Pareto optimal in S given agents with Hamming (Issue-wise) set based preferences.\n\u2022 LCO is Pareto optimal in S given agents with Issue-wise distance based preferences.\n\u2022 LCO is not Pareto optimal in S given agents with Hamming distance based preferences.\nSince both LCO and LX are admissible labelings that are compatible (\u2248) with both of L1 and L2, then using Theorems 3 and 4:\n\u2022 LCO is Pareto optimal in S given agents with IUO Hamming (Issue-wise) set based preferences.\n\u2022 LCO is Pareto optimal in S given agents with IUO Issue-wise distance based preferences.\n\u2022 LCO is not Pareto optimal in S given agents with IUO Hamming distance based preferences.\nAlso consider the following example.\nExample 2. Consider Figure 8, let Ag = {1,2} be the set of agents 1 and 2, whose preferred labelings are respectively L1 and L2, and let S= {LCO,LX}. Note the following:\n\u2022 LCO is Pareto optimal in S given agents with Hamming (Issue-wise) set based preferences.\n\u2022 LCO is Pareto optimal in S given agents with Hamming distance based preferences.\n\u2022 LCO is not Pareto optimal in S given agents with Issue-wise distance based preferences.\nAlso, since both LCO and LX are admissible labelings that are compatible (\u2248) with both of L1 and L2, then using Theorems 3 and 4:\n\u2022 LCO is Pareto optimal in S given agents with IUO Hamming (Issue-wise) set based preferences.\n\u2022 LCO is Pareto optimal in S given agents with IUO Hamming distance based preferences.\n\u2022 LCO is not Pareto optimal in S given agents with IUO Issue-wise distance based preferences.\nFollowing, we show the results about Pareto optimality regarding the three operators: the skeptical, the credulous and the super credulous.\nTheorem 5. If individual preferences are Hamming set based, then the skeptical aggregation operator is Pareto optimal in the set of admissible labelings that are smaller or equal (v) to each of the participants\u2019 labelings.\nProof. Let P be a profile of labelings, LSO = soAF(P) and LX some admissible labeling with the property \u2200i \u2208 Ag,LX v Li. From Theorem 1 we know that LSO is the biggest admissible labeling with such property, so LX v LSO. So we have \u2200i \u2208 Ag,LX v LSO v Li. From Lemma 4 we have LSO i LX for any i. So no agent strictly prefers LX and hence there is no labeling that Pareto dominates LSO.\nTheorem 6. If individual preferences are Hamming distance based, then the skeptical aggregation operator is Pareto optimal in the set of admissible labelings that are smaller or equal (v) to each of the participants\u2019 labelings.\nProof. In the proof of Theorem 5, Hamming set may be replaced by Hamming distance because it is only used in Lemma 4, which works for Hamming distance as well.\nTheorem 7. If individual preferences are Hamming set based, then the credulous aggregation operator is Pareto optimal in the set of admissible labelings that are compatible (\u2248) with each of the participants\u2019 labelings.\nProof. Let P be a profile of labelings, LCO = coAF(P), LCIO = cioAF(P). Assume by contradiction that there exists some admissible labeling LX with the property \u2200i \u2208 Ag,LX \u2248 Li that Pareto dominates LCO.\nFirst notice that compatibility ensures that there are no in/out conflicts between LX and LCO. If there is an in/out conflict between agents\u2019 labelings on some argument, then both LX and LCO need to label it undec. If there exists an agent whose labeling decides on some argument and other agents\u2019 labelings agree or refrain from decision, LCO and LX also agree or refrain from decision. If all agents refrain from decision on some argument, LCO by definition also refrains, and LX may label freely.\nLet us take A \u2208 dec(LX). Then, there needs to be an agent with a labeling that agrees on A. Otherwise all agents\u2019 labelings would be undecided on such argument and, according to definition, LCO would not decide either. But then all agents\u2019 labelings will agree on such argument with LCO and disagree with LX , so no agent will strongly prefer LX , which contradicts with domination. So there exists at least one agent whose labeling agrees with LX on A. Other agents\u2019 labelings also need to agree on A or label it undec because of the compatibility of LX . Then by definition LCIO(A) = LX(A). This holds for any argument A \u2208 dec(LX), so we have LX v LCIO. But LX is admissible and, by definition, LCO is the biggest admissible labeling less or equally committed as LCIO. So we have LX v LCO v LCIO.\nLX must be different from LCO to dominate it. Let A be an argument on which these labelings differ. From the previous considerations, it follows that A \u2208 undec(LX) and A \u2208 dec(LCO). LCO decides on an argument only if there exists an agent that decides on such argument. But then this agent will agree on A with LCO and disagree with LX , so it will not prefer LX . This is in contradiction with dominance. Hence, such dominating labeling cannot exist.\nObservation 11. If individual preferences are Hamming distance based, then the credulous (resp. the super credulous) aggregation operator is not Pareto optimal in the set of admissible (resp. complete) labelings that are compatible (\u2248) with each of the participants\u2019 labelings. An example is given in Figure 9 where LCO represents the outcome of the credulous (or the super credulous) aggregation operator. Both labelings LCO and LX are compatible with both L1 and L2, but LX is closer when applying Hamming distance. L1 LCO = L2 LCO = {A,B,E,F,G}, so the Hamming distance is 5, whereas L1 LX = L2 LX = {A,B,C,D}, so the Hamming distance is 4.\nTheorem 8. If individual preferences are Hamming set based, then the super credulous aggregation operator is Pareto optimal in the set of complete labelings that are compatible (\u2248) with each of the participants\u2019 labelings.\nProof. Let P be a profile of labelings, LCIO = cioAF(P), LCO = coAF(P), and LSCO = scoAF(P). Suppose, towards a contradiction, that there exists a complete labeling LX s.t. LX \u2248 Li \u2200i \u2208 Ag, and LX dominates LSCO (w.r.t i, ).\nLet A \u2208 dec(LCO), then LSCO agrees on A with LCO. However, LCO only decides on an argument if at least one agent decides on this argument and agrees with LCO on it. Then, this agent also agrees on A with LSCO. Since LX , by assumption, Pareto dominates LSCO, LX also needs to agree with this agent on A. This is the case for every argument A \u2208 dec(LCO). Hence, \u2200A \u2208 dec(LCO) : LCO(A) =LX(A). Then, LCO vLX . By definition, LSCO is the smallest element (w.r.t v) of the set of all complete labelings that are bigger or equally committed than LCO. Then, LCO v LSCO v LX .\nLX should be different from LSCO to dominate it. Then, \u2203A \u2208 undec(LSCO)\u2229 dec(LX). We will show that \u2200A \u2208 undec(LSCO)\u2229 dec(LX) then \u2200i \u2208 Ag : Li(A) = undec. This is enough to reach a contradiction because it shows that all agents agree on at least one argument with LSCO while disagree with LX on that argument.\nSuppose, for contradiction, that there exists an agent j such that L j(A) = LX(A) \u2208 {in,out}. Since A \u2208 undec(LSCO), then A \u2208 undec(LCO). However, LX is a complete labeling which means that it is also an admissible labeling, and from Theorem 7, LCO is Pareto optimal in the set of all admissible labelings that are compatible (\u2248) with each of the participants\u2019 labelings. Then:\n\u2200B \u2208A,\u00ac\u2203i \u2208 Ag s.t. LCO(B) 6= Li(B)\u2227LX(B) = Li(B) (32)\nContradiction. Then, all agents need to agree with LCO and LSCO on every A s.t. A\u2208 undec(LSCO)\u2229 dec(LX) (and disagree with LX on A).\nTheorem 9. If individual preferences are Issue-wise distance based, then the skeptical aggregation operator is Pareto optimal in the set of admissible labelings that are smaller or equal (w.r.t v) to\neach of the participants\u2019 labelings.\nProof. Let I be the set of all issues in AF, P be a profile of labelings, and LSO = soAF(P). Suppose, towards a contradiction, that there exists an admissible labeling LX s.t. LX v Li \u2200i \u2208 Ag, and LX dominates LSO (w.r.t i,| W|). Then, there needs to be at least one issue on which LX agrees with some labeling L j (by an agent j), while LSO disagrees with L j on that issue:\n\u2203 j \u2208 Ag,\u2203B \u2208 I s.t. (LX(A) = L j(A))\u2227 (LSO(A) 6= L j(A)) for some (equiv. all) A \u2208B (33)\nHowever, from Theorem 1, LSO is the biggest labeling (w.r.t v) in X. Then LX v LSO v Li \u2200i \u2208 Ag. LX should be different from LSO to dominate it. Then, \u2203A \u2208 undec(LX)\u2229 dec(LSO) (where A belongs to some issue B \u2208 I). However, LSO only decides on an argument if all agents decide on this argument and agree on it with LSO. Accordingly, all agents disagree with LX on A. Note that this holds for all A \u2208 undec(LX)\u2229 dec(LSO). Additionally, \u2200B /\u2208 undec(LX)\u2229 dec(LSO) : LSO(B) = LX(B). Hence:\n\u00ac\u2203LX \u2208 X s.t. \u2203 j \u2208 Ag : (LX(A) = L j(A))\u2227 (LSO(A) 6= L j(A)) for any A \u2208A (34)\nContradiction.\nObservation 12. If individual preferences are Issue-wise distance based, then the credulous (resp. the super credulous) aggregation operator is not Pareto optimal in the set of admissible (resp. complete) labelings that are compatible (\u2248) with each of the participants\u2019 labelings. In Figure 10, LCO represents the outcome of the credulous (or the super credulous) aggregation operator. Note that, both labelings of LCO and LX are compatible with both L1 and L2, but LX is closer when applying Issue-wise distance. L1 W LCO = L2 W LCO = {{C,D},{E},{F}}, so Issue-wise distance is 3, whereas L1 WLX = L2 WLX = {{A,B},{C,D}}, so Issue-wise distance is 2.\nProposition 1. If individual preferences are IUO Hamming sets (resp. distance) based, then the skeptical aggregation operator is Pareto optimal in the set of admissible labelings that are smaller or equal (v) to each of the participants\u2019 labelings.\nProof. Let S be the set of admissible labelings that are smaller or equal (v) to each of the participants\u2019 labelings. Then, S \u2286 X, where X is defined in Theorem 3.

If individual preferences are IUO Hamming distance based, then the credulous aggregation operator is not Pareto optimal in the set of admissible labelings that are compatible (\u2248) with each of the participants\u2019 labelings.\nProof. Similar to the previous proposition, from Observation 11 and Theorem 3 the credulous aggregation operator is not Pareto optimal in S (S is defined in the previous proposition) when individual preferences are IUO Hamming distance based.\nProposition 4. If individual preferences are IUO Hamming sets based, then the super credulous aggregation operator is Pareto optimal in the set of complete labelings that are compatible (\u2248) with each of the participants\u2019 labelings.\nProof. Let S be the set of complete labelings that are compatible (\u2248) with each of the participants\u2019 labelings. Then, S \u2286 X, where X is defined in Theorem 3. From Theorem 8 and Theorem 3 the super credulous aggregation operator is Pareto optimal in S when individual preferences are IUO Hamming sets based.\nProposition 5. If individual preferences are IUO Hamming distance based, then the super credulous aggregation operator is not Pareto optimal in the set of complete labelings that are compatible (\u2248) with each of the participants\u2019 labelings.\nProof. Similar to the previous proposition, from Observation 11 and Theorem 3 the super credulous aggregation operator is not Pareto optimal in S (S is defined in the previous proposition) when individual preferences are IUO Hamming distance based.\nProposition 6. If individual preferences are IUO Issue-wise distance based, then the skeptical aggregation operator is Pareto optimal in the set of admissible labelings that are smaller or equal (v) to each of the participants\u2019 labelings.\nProof. Let S be the set of admissible labelings that are smaller or equal (v) to each of the participants\u2019 labelings. Then, S \u2286 X, where X is defined in Theorem 4. From Theorem 9 and Theorem 4 the skeptical aggregation operator is Pareto optimal in S when individual preferences are IUO Issue-wise distance based.\nProposition 7. If individual preferences are IUO Issue-wise distance based, then the credulous aggregation operator is not Pareto optimal in the set of admissible labelings that are compatible (\u2248) with each of the participants\u2019 labelings.\nProof. Similar to the previous proposition, from Observation 12 and Theorem 4 the credulous aggregation operator is not Pareto optimal in S (S is defined in the previous proposition) when individual preferences are IUO Issue-wise distance based.\nProposition 8. If individual preferences are IUO Issue-wise distance based, then the super credulous aggregation operator is not Pareto optimal in the set of complete labelings that are compatible (\u2248) with each of the participants\u2019 labelings.\nProof. Similar to the previous proposition, from Observation 12 and Theorem 4 the super credulous aggregation operator is not Pareto optimal in S (S is defined in the previous proposition) when individual preferences are IUO Issue-wise distance based.\nThe following example shows how Pareto optimality does not generally carry over from homogeneous preferences to heterogeneous preferences.\nExample 3. Consider the framework and labelings in Figure 11. Let Ag = {1,2}, S = {L,LX} and R = {| | , | W|}. When Ag have homogeneous preferences from R (i.e. both agents have Hamming distance based preferences or both have Issue-wise distance based preferences), then L is Pareto optimal in S:\nL1 | |L= 4 , L1 | |LX = 3 (i.e. LX 1,| | L) L2 | |L= 3 , L2 | |LX = 4 (i.e. L 2,| | LX )\nL1 | W|L= 1 , L1 | W|LX = 2 (i.e. L 1,| W| LX ) L2 | W|L= 2 , L2 | W|LX = 1 (i.e. LX 2,| W| L)\nHowever, if agent 1 has Hamming distance based preferences and agent 2 has Issue-wise distance based preferences then both agents would strictly prefer LX over L and this means that L would not be Pareto optimal in S when Ag have heterogeneous preferences from R.\nTheorem 10. Let R= { , M} be a set of preference classes, Ag be a set of agents, S be the set of all admissible labelings that are compatible with each individual\u2019s labeling, and L be a labeling from S. If L is Pareto optimal in S given that Ag have homogeneous preferences from R, then L is Pareto optimal in S given that Ag have heterogeneous preferences from R.\nProof. Let Ag be s.t. agents have heterogeneous preferences from R. Suppose towards a contradiction, that L is not Pareto optimal in S when each agent i has c(i) \u2208 R based preferences. Then, there is a labeling LX that Pareto dominates L w.r.t c(i) based preferences, i.e. \u2203LX \u2208 S s.t:\n(\u2200i \u2208 Ag : LX i,c(i) L)\u2227 (\u2203 j \u2208 Ag s.t. LX j,c( j) L) (35)\nwhere c(i) \u2208 R,\u2200i \u2208 Ag (i.e. c(i) = or c(i) = M). Then, from the definition of set based preference:\n(\u2200i \u2208 Ag : LX c(i) Li \u2286 L c(i) Li)\u2227 (\u2203 j \u2208 Ag s.t. L c( j) L j 6\u2286 LX c( j) L j) (36)\nHowever, given the compatibility of L and LX with every individuals\u2019 labeling (since L,LX \u2208 S) and from Lemma 2 (1), if agents who have Hamming set based preferences switched their classes of preferences to IUO Hamming sets based preferences or vice versa, then their preferences would not change. As a result, the previous equation would hold even when c(k) = c(l),\u2200k, l \u2208 Ag. This means L is not Pareto optimal in S when Ag have homogeneous preferences from R. Contradiction.\nTheorem 11. Let R= { , W, M, MW, | | , | W| , \u2223\u2223 M\u2223\u2223 , \u2223\u2223 MW\u2223\u2223}. The skeptical operator is Pareto optimal in the set of all admissible labelings that are smaller or equal (v) to each of the participants\u2019 labelings given that individuals have heterogeneous preferences from R.\nProof. Let S be the set of all admissible labelings that are smaller or equal (v) to individuals\u2019 labelings. Suppose, towards a contradiction that the skeptical operator is not Pareto optimal in S given that the set of individuals Ag have heterogeneous preferences from R. Then, \u2203LX \u2208 S s.t. LX Pareto dominates L (given heterogeneous preferences). Then:\n\u2203 j \u2208 Ag s.t.

Then, \u2200L\u2032 \u2208 S : L\u2032 vLvLi,\u2200i \u2208 Ag. Hence, for any agent i\u2019s labeling Li, and for any argument (and consequently, any issue) on which L disagrees with Li, then LX would disagree in exactly the same way.

L \u2032 Op k,| | LOp).\nThen Xk| M| \u2286 X k | |.\nProof. \u2200L\u2032Op \u2208 Xk| M|, we have:\n1. There exists some labeling L\u2032k s.t. L \u2032 Op = soAF(PLk/L\u2032k), and\n2. L\u2032Op k,| M| LOp.\nWe just need to show that L\u2032Op k,| | LOp. Since L\u2032Op k,| M| LOp, then L \u2032 Op \u2223\u2223 M\u2223\u2223Lk < LOp \u2223\u2223 M\u2223\u2223Lk. Then: 2\u00d7|L\u2032Op io Lk|+ |L\u2032Op du Lk|< 2\u00d7|LOp io Lk|+ |LOp du Lk| (38)\nSince |LOp io Lk|= 0:\n2\u00d7|L\u2032Op io Lk|+ |L\u2032Op du Lk|< |LOp du Lk| (39) Which implies:\n|L\u2032Op io Lk|+ |L\u2032Op du Lk|< |LOp du Lk| (40) But |L\u2032Op Lk|= |L\u2032Op io Lk|+ |L\u2032Op du Lk| and |LOp Lk|= |LOp du Lk|. Then:\n|L\u2032Op Lk|< |LOp Lk| (41) Which means L\u2032Op | | LOp. Hence, L\u2032Op \u2208 Xk| |.\nWe now show that the benevolence property of lies with an operator carries over from Hamming distance based preferences to IUO Hamming distance based preferences.\nTheorem 12. Consider an operator Op that only produces labelings that are compatible (\u2248) with each individual\u2019s labeling. If all strategic lies are benevolent when agents have Hamming distance based preferences then all strategic lies are benevolent when agents have IUO Hamming distance based preferences.\nProof. Let Op be a compatible operator. Let P be a profile, and L\u2032k a strategic lie of agent k. Denote LOp = OpAF(P) and L\u2032Op = OpAF(PLk/L\u2032k). From Lemma 2 (1), since the operator Op only produces labelings that are compatible with all individuals\u2019 labelings, then for every agent j s.t. j 6= k: (LOp j,| | L\u2032Op iff LOp j,| M| L \u2032 Op) i.e. Hamming distance based preferences and IUO Hamming distance based preferences are equivalent for all agents other than agent k. Now given Lemma 6, every strategic lie with the operator Op given IUO Hamming distance based preferences is also a strategic lie given Hamming distance based preferences. However, all those lies are benevolent for every agent j 6= k whether she has Hamming distance based preferences or IUO Hamming distance based preferences. Hence, every lie given IUO Hamming distance based preferences is benevolent.\nConsider an operator Op that only produces labelings that are compatible (\u2248) with each individual\u2019s labeling. The following lemma shows that every strategic lie with the operator Op given IUO Issue-wise distance based preferences is also a strategic lie given Issue-wise distance based preferences. This lemma is crucial to show that the benevolence property of lies with the operator Op carries over from Issue-wise distance based preferences to IUO Issue-wise distance based preferences.\nLemma 7. Let Op be a compatible operator. Let Lk denote the top preference labeling of agent k. Let P be a profile where each agent submits her most preferred labeling, and let P\u2032 = PLk/L\u2032k be a profile that results from P by changing Lk to L\u2032k. Let LOp = OpAF(P) be the outcome when agent k does not lie. Let Xk| MW| (resp. Xk| W|) be the set of all labelings L \u2032 Op that satisfy the following two properties:\n1. There exists some labeling L\u2032k, L \u2032 Op = OpAF(PLk/L\u2032k), and\n2. L\u2032Op k,| MW| LOp (resp. L \u2032 Op k,| W| LOp).\nThen Xk| MW| \u2286 Xk| W|.\nProof. This proof is similar to the one in Lemma 6.\nTheorem 13. Consider an operator Op that only produces labelings that are compatible (\u2248) with each individual\u2019s labeling. If all strategic lies are benevolent when agents have Issue-wise distance based preferences then all strategic lies are benevolent when agents have IUO Issue-wise distance based preferences.\nProof. This proof is similar to the one for Theorem 12, with the use of Lemma 2 (2) and Lemma 7.\nObservation 13. The skeptical aggregation operator is not strategy proof for neither Hamming set nor Hamming distance based preferences. Consider the three labelings in Figure 12. Labeling L1 of agent 1 when aggregated with L2 gives labeling L3, which disagrees with L1 on all three arguments. But, when the agent strategically lies and reports labeling L2 instead, the result of the aggregation is the same labeling L2, which differs only on two arguments {A,B}. The example is valid for both Hamming set and Hamming distance based preferences.\nObservation 14. The credulous (resp. super credulous) aggregation operator is not strategy proof for neither Hamming set nor Hamming distance based preferences. See the example in Figure 13. Labeling L2 of agent 2 when aggregated with L1 gives labeling LCO, which disagrees with L2 on the two arguments. But, when the agent strategically lies and reports L\u20322 instead, the result of the aggregation is L\u2032CO, which matches the labeling L2. This lie by agent 2 makes the agent with labeling L1 worse off. The example is valid for both Hamming set and Hamming distance based preferences.\nTheorem 14. Consider the skeptical aggregation operator and Hamming set based preferences. For any agent, her strategic lies are benevolent.\nProof. Let P be a profile, and L\u2032k a strategic lie of agent k. Denote LSO = soAF(P) and L \u2032 SO = soAF(PLk/L\u2032k). Agent k\u2019s preference is L \u2032 SO k LSO (i). We will show that for any agent i 6= k, we have L\u2032SO i LSO. Since the skeptical aggregation operator produces social outcomes that are less or equally committed to all the individual labelings, we have that L\u2032SO v Li for all i 6= k (ii). Similarly, we have LSO v Lk (iii). From (i) and (iii), by Lemma 5, we have that LSO v L\u2032SO (iv). From (iv) and (ii) we have LSO vL\u2032SO vLi for all i 6= k. Finally, we can apply Lemma 4 to obtain L\u2032SO i LSO for all i 6= k (v). We showed that a lie cannot be malicious, now we show that it is benevolent.\n(iii) implies undec(Lk)\u2286 undec(LSO) (vi). (i) and (vi) imply \u2203A\u2208 dec(Lk) : A\u2208 undec(LSO)\u2227 A \u2208 dec(L\u2032SO) (vii). From (vii), (ii) and (v) L\u2032SO i LSO for i 6= k.\nTheorem 15. Consider the skeptical aggregation operator and Hamming distance based preferences. For any agent, her strategic lies are benevolent.\nProof. Let P be a profile, and L\u2032k a strategic lie of agent k whose most preferred labeling is Lk. Denote LSO = soAF(P) and L\u2032SO = soAF(PLk/L\u2032k). We will show that, if L \u2032 SO is strictly preferred to LSO by agent k, then it is also strictly preferred by any other agent. Without loss of generality we can take agent j, j 6= k,whose most preferred labeling is L j.\nLet us partition the arguments into the following disjoint groups:\n\u2022 X= dec(LSO)\\dec(L\u2032SO) (decided arguments that became undecided).\n\u2022 Y= dec(L\u2032SO)\\dec(LSO) (undecided arguments that became decided).\n\u2022 Z= dec(L\u2032SO)\u2229dec(LSO) (arguments decided in both labelings).\n\u2022 V= undec(L\u2032SO)\u2229undec(LSO) (arguments undecided in both labelings).\nLabelings LSO and L\u2032SO agree on the arguments in V (which are labeled undec) and Z (whose arguments are labeled in or out). For the arguments in Z there are no in\u2212out conflicts between LSO and L\u2032SO as the skeptical aggregation operator guarantees social outcomes less or equally committed than L j. Therefore, only arguments from X and Y have an impact on the Hamming distance.\nBoth labelings Lk and L j agree with LSO on the arguments in X because LSO decides on those arguments and is less or equally committed than both labelings. On the other side, L\u2032SO remains undecided on the arguments in X so both labelings Lk and L j disagree with L\u2032SO on X.\nL\u2032SO is less or equally committed than L j so, as above, we obtain that on the arguments in Y, L j agrees with L\u2032SO and disagrees with LSO. On the contrary, L \u2032 SO does not have to be less or equally committed than Lk and so, for agent k, some of the arguments from Y increase the distance and some of them decrease. If agent k prefers L\u2032SO to LSO, then the number of the arguments decreasing the distance must be greater than the number of those increasing by more than |X|. But for agent j all the arguments from Y are decreasing the distance, as L j agrees with L\u2032SO on the whole Y. So, if agent k gains by switching to labeling L\u2032SO, agent j needs to gain at least the same.\nObservation 15. The skeptical aggregation operator is not strategy proof for neither Issue-wise set nor Issue-wise distance based preferences. Consider the three labelings in Figure 14.11 Labeling L1 of agent 1 when aggregated with L2 gives labeling L3, which disagrees with L1 on both of the two issues. But, when the agent strategically lies and reports labeling L2 instead, the result of the aggregation is the same labeling L2, which differs only on one issue {{A,B}}. The example is valid for both Issue-wise set and Issue-wise distance based preferences.\nObservation 16. The credulous (resp. super credulous) aggregation operator is not strategy proof for neither Issue-wise set nor Issue-wise distance based preferences. In Figure 15,12 labeling L2 of agent 2 when aggregated with L1 gives labeling LCO, which disagrees with L2 on the one and only issue. But, when the agent strategically lies and reports L\u20322 instead, the result of the aggregation is L\u2032CO, which matches the labeling L2. This lie by agent 2 makes the agent with labeling L1 worse off. The example is valid for both Issue-wise set and Issue-wise distance based preferences.\nTheorem 16. Consider the skeptical aggregation operator and Issue-wise distance based preferences. For any agent, her strategic lies are benevolent.\nProof. Let P be a profile of labelings, and L\u2032k be a strategic lie of agent k whose most preferred labeling is Lk. Denote LSO = soAF(P) and L\u2032SO = soAF(PLk/L\u2032k). We show that if L \u2032 SO is strictly\n11This figure is the same as Fig 12 with issues being evidenced. 12This figure is the same as Fig 13 with issues being evidenced.\npreferred by an agent k then it is also strictly preferred by any other agent. Without loss of generality, we can take agent j, j 6= k, whose most preferred labeling is L j.\nLet Ide(L) (resp. Iun(L)) be the set of issues, each of which has arguments that are only decided (resp. undecided) according to L. We call Ide(L) (resp. Iun(L)) a decided (resp. undecided) issue (w.r.t L). Let us partition the issues into the following disjoint groups:\n\u2022 X= Ide(LSO)\\ Ide(L\u2032SO) (decided issues that became undecided).\n\u2022 Y= Ide(L\u2032SO)\\ Ide(LSO) (undecided issues that became decided).\n\u2022 Z= Ide(LSO)\u2229 Ide(L\u2032SO) (issues decided in both labelings).\n\u2022 V= Iun(LSO)\u2229 Iun(L\u2032SO) (issues undecided in both labelings).\nThe rest is similar to Theorem 15, but using issues instead of arguments.\nTheorem 17. The skeptical aggregation operator is strategy proof when individuals have IUO Hamming sets based preferences.\nProof. Let P be a profile, Lk be the top preference of agent k, and L\u2032k 6= Lk be any potential lie that agent k might consider. Denote LSO = soAF(P) and L\u2032SO = soAF(PLk/L\u2032k). We will show that \u00ac(L\u2032SO k, M LSO). Which means, we need to show:\n\u00ac((L\u2032SO k, M LSO)\u2227\u00ac(LSO k, M L \u2032 SO)) (42)\n\u00ac(L\u2032SO k, M LSO)\u2228 (LSO k, M L \u2032 SO) (43)\nIn other words:\n\u00ac((L\u2032SO io Lk \u2286 LSO io Lk)\u2227 (L\u2032SO du Lk \u2286 LSO du Lk)) \u2228(LSO k, M L \u2032 SO) (44)\nTo reformulate, we only need to show that one of the following holds:\n1. \u00ac(L\u2032SO io Lk \u2286 LSO io Lk), or\n2. \u00ac(L\u2032SO du Lk \u2286 LSO du Lk), or\n3.\n(a) LSO io Lk \u2286 L\u2032SO io Lk, and (b) LSO du Lk \u2286 L\u2032SO du Lk.\nFirst, by definition, LSO is less or equally committed (v) than Lk. So, LSO io Lk = /0, However, this is not the case for L\u2032SO and Lk. So, L \u2032 SO io Lk might not be an empty set. Hence, LSO io Lk \u2286 L\u2032SO io Lk i.e. (3)(a) is satisfied. Now we show that either (1),(2) or (3)(b) is satisfied.\nSuppose (1) and (2) are violated and we will show that (3)(b) is then satisfied. This shows that (1), (2), and (3)(b) cannot be all violated together.\nSince (1) is violated and since LSO ioLk = /0 then L\u2032SO ioLk = /0 (i). Since (2) is violated then \u2200a : (a\u2208L\u2032SO duLk\u21d2 a\u2208LSO duLk) (ii). Note that \u2200a : (a\u2208L\u2032SO duLk\u21d2 (a\u2208 undec(L\u2032SO)\u2227 a \u2208 dec(Lk)))(iii). Otherwise, we would have a \u2208 dec(L\u2032SO)\u2227 a \u2208 undec(Lk) and from (ii) we would have a \u2208 dec(LSO)\u2227a \u2208 undec(Lk) which contradicts LSO v Lk.\nFrom (i) and (iii), \u2200a \u2208 in(L\u2032SO)\u21d2 a \u2208 in(Lk) (iv) (from (i), Lk(a) 6= out, and from (iii), Lk(a) 6= undec). Similarly, from (i) and (iii), \u2200a \u2208 out(L\u2032SO)\u21d2 a \u2208 out(Lk) (v). From (iv) and (v), L\u2032SO v Lk. Since \u2200i 6= k: L\u2032SO v Li, then \u2200i \u2208 Ag: L\u2032SO v Li. By Theorem 1, L\u2032SO v LSO. Then, undec(LSO)\u2286 undec(L\u2032SO) (vi).\nNow, \u2200a\u2208LSO duLk then a\u2208 undec(LSO)\u2227a\u2208 dec(Lk). From (vi), a\u2208 undec(L\u2032SO). Thus, a \u2208 L\u2032SO du Lk. Then, (3)(b) is satisfied.\nObservation 17. The skeptical aggregation operator is not strategy proof when individuals have IUO Hamming distance based preferences. Consider the three labelings in Figure 16. Labeling L1 of agent 1 when aggregated (using skeptical operator) with L2 gives labeling L3, which differs from L1 on all five arguments with respect to dec\u2212 undec Hamming set. Then, L1\n\u2223\u2223 M\u2223\u2223L3 = 2\u00d70+1\u00d75 = 5. But, when the agent strategically lies and reports labeling L2 instead, the result of the aggregation is the same labeling L2, which differs only on two arguments {A,B} with respect to in\u2212out Hamming set. Then, L1 \u2223\u2223 M\u2223\u2223L2 = 2\u00d72+1\u00d70 = 4.\nObservation 18. The credulous (resp. super credulous) aggregation operator is not strategy proof for neither IUO Hamming sets nor IUO Hamming distance based preferences. The example in Figure 13 can serve as a counterexample for the case where individuals have IUO Hamming sets (or IUO Hamming distance) based preferences. The agent with labeling L2 can insincerely report L\u20322 to obtain her preferred labeling. This makes an agent with labeling L1 worse off.\nProposition 9. Consider the skeptical aggregation operator and IUO Hamming distance based preferences. For any agent, her strategic lies are benevolent.\nProof. From Theorem 15 and Theorem 12, the strategic lies are benevolent when individuals have IUO Hamming distance based.\nObservation 19. The skeptical aggregation operator is not strategy proof when individuals have IUO Issue-wise distance based preferences. Consider the three labelings in Figure 17.13 Labeling L1 of agent 1 when aggregated (using skeptical operator) with L2 gives labeling L3, which differs from L1 on all three issues with respect to dec\u2212 undec Issue-wise set. Then, L1\n\u2223\u2223 MW\u2223\u2223L3 = 2\u00d70+1\u00d73 = 3. But, when the agent strategically lies and reports labeling L2 instead, the result of the aggregation is the same labeling L2, which differs only on one is {{A,B}} with respect to in\u2212out Issue-wise set. Then, L1 \u2223\u2223 MW\u2223\u2223L2 = 2\u00d71+1\u00d70 = 2.\nObservation 20. The credulous and super credulous aggregation operators are not strategy proof when individuals have IUO Issue-wise sets (resp. distance) based preferences. The example in Figure 15 can serve as a counter example for the case where individuals have IUO Issue-wise sets (resp. distance) based preferences. The agent with labeling L2 can insincerely report L\u20322 to obtain her preferred labeling. This makes an agent with labeling L1 worse off.\nProposition 10. Consider the skeptical aggregation operator and IUO Issue-wise distance based preferences. For any agent, her strategic lies are benevolent.\nProof. From Theorem 16 and Theorem , the strategic lies are benevolent when individuals have IUO Issue-wise distance based.\nTheorem 18. Let F be the set of all possible classes of preferences, R be some set s.t. R \u2286 F, and Ag be the set of agents. If an operator is strategy proof given that Ag have homogeneous preferences from R, then it is strategy proof given that Ag have heterogeneous preferences from R.\n13This figure is the same as Fig 16 with issues being evidenced.\nProof. Let Op be an operator that is strategy proof given that Ag have homogeneous preferences from R (i.e. \u2200i, j \u2208 Ag c(i) = c( j) \u2208 R). Then, there exists no single agent j that has an incentive to lie about her preferences (given that all agents have the same class of preferences). Note that agent j has no incentive to lie given that the submitted labelings by all agents other than j are fixed. Hence, the classes of preferences that are assumed for any agent k 6= j do not affect the incentive of agent j to lie or otherwise. Thus, the same result would hold whether other agents\u2019 preferences are different from c( j) or not."}], "references": [{"title": "Social choice and individual", "author": ["Kenneth J.

Collective argument evaluation is the problem of aggregating the opinions of multiple agents on how a given set of arguments should be evaluated. It is crucial not only to ensure that the outcome is logically consistent, but also satisfies measures of social optimality and immunity to strategic manipulation. This is because agents have their individual preferences about what the outcome ought to be. In the current paper, we analyze three previously introduced argument-based aggregation operators with respect to Pareto optimality and strategy proofness under different general classes of agent preferences. We highlight fundamental trade-offs between strategic manipulability and social optimality on one hand, and classical logical criteria on the other. Our results motivate further investigation into the relationship between social choice and argumentation theory. The results are also relevant for choosing an appropriate aggregation operator given the criteria that are considered more important, as well as the nature of agents\u2019 preferences. 1 ar X iv :1 60 4. 00 69 3v 2 [ cs .A I] 7 A pr 2 01 7", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
