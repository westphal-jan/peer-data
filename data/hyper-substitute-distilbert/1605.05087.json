These two methods are analyses of a correlation or variance\u2013covariance matrix of a multivariate quantitative dataset. CA is an analysis of CD.\nAlso, CA is a statistical visualization method for picturing the associations between the levels of a two-way contingency table. To illustrate CA, one might consider the contingency table presented in Table 1, which shows data well known as Fisher\u2019s data[4] for eye and hair color of people in Caithness, Scotland. The CA of these data yield the graphical display presented in Figure 1. Figure 1 shows the correspondence between eye and hair color.\nPCA is the eigenvalue decomposition of a covariance matrix. CCA is the singular value decomposition (SVD) based on the matrix representing correlation with modification of the average and the inhomogeneousness. CA can be regarded as SVD of the covariance of CD with modification of the average and inhomogeneousness like that of CCA. And the Gini-index is another way of addressing the variance of CD. Okada [11, 10] reported that defining the Giniindex using one-hot encoding on appropriately rotated space yields reasonable values for the covariance. This research describes the rotated Gini-index with modifying inhomogeneousness is equivalent to CA.\nPicca et al. [13] introduced nonlinear kernel extension of CA. Niitsuma et al. [9] introduced nonlinear kernel extension of the rotated Gini-index. Equivalence between CA and the modified Gini-index can define more general nonlinear kernel extension of CA. Calling this nonlinear kernel extension kernel Correspondence Analysis (KCA), we note that gives well-known analysis for CD and natural language processing by specializing kernels. For example, our KCA can give G-test, skip-gram with negative-sampling (SGNS)[8, 6], and GloVe[12] as a special case.\nWe apply KCA to natural language processing. Especially we specifically examine vector representations of words. Mikolov et al.[8] introduced dense vector representations of words referred to as word2vec. The vector representations give meaning subtraction or addition operations of the vectors. For example, the analogy \u201cKing is to queen as man is to woman.\u201d is encoded in the vector space by the following vector equation: king \u2212 queen = man \u2212 woman. Sometimes CA also has a similar property. For example, we can see the vector equation: (eye:dark)\u2212 (eye:medium) = (hair:dark)\u2212 (hair:medium) in Figure 1.\nLevy et al. [6] showed that skip-gram with negative-sampling (SGNS), which is one of word2vec, can be regarded as analysis of the two-way contingency table in which the row represents a word, and the column represents context. [6] showed that SGNS is the matrix factorization of pointwise mutual information (PMI) of the contingency table. Actually, PMI can be regarded as a log-scale representation of a contingency table. We formulate this mechanism within KCA by providing the appropriate kernels."}, {"heading": "2 Correspondence Analysis", "text": "Actually, CA is a generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) 1 based on a contingency table for two categorical variables such that\nU\u0306 S\u0302V\u0306 t = \u039e (1)\n\u039e = N/n\u2212 rct/n2 (2)\nU\u0306 tD(r)\u22121U\u0306 = V\u0306 tD(c)\u22121V\u0306 = E (3)\nwhere N is an nr \u00d7 nc contingency table, with entries nij giving the frequency with which row categorical variables xr = i occur together with column categorical variable xc = j.

that Correspondence Analysis (CA) is equivalent to defining the Gini-index with appropriately scaled one-hot encoding. Using this relation, we introduce nonlinear kernel extension of CA. The extended CA gives well-known analysis for categorical data (CD) and natural language processing by specializing kernels. For example, our formulation can give G-test, skip-gram with negative-sampling (SGNS), and GloVe as special cases. We introduce two kernels for natural language processing based on our formulation: a stop word (SW) kernel and a word similarity (WS) kernel. The SW kernel is a system introducing appropriate weights for SW. The WS kernel enables the use of WS test data as training data for vector space representations of words. We show that these kernels enhance accuracy when training data are insufficiently numerous.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
