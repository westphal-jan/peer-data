INTRODUCTION\nComplex signals and high-dimensional datasets collected from a variety of fields of science, such as physics, engineering, genetics, molecular biology and many others, can be naturally modeled as values on the vertices of weighted graphs [1], [2]. Recently, dynamic activity over networks has been the subject of intense research in order to develop new models to understand and analyze epidemic spreading [3], rumor spreading over social networks [4], [5] or activity on sensor networks. The advances in the graph research has led to new tools to process and analyze time-varying graph and/or signal on the graph, such as multilayer graphs and tensor product of graphs [6], [7]. However, there is still a lack of signal processing methods able to retrieve or process information on dynamic phenomena taking place over graphs. For example the wavelets on graphs [8], [9] or the vertexfrequency transform [10] are dedicated to the study of a static signal over a graph.\nMotivated by an increasing amount of applications, we design a new class of wavelet frames named Dynamic Graph Wavelets (DGW) whose time evolution depends on the graph topology and follows a dynamic process. Each atom of the frame is a time-varying function defined on the graph. Combined with sparse recovery methods, such as compressive sensing, this allows for the detection and analysis of timevarying processes on graphs. These processes can be, for example, waves propagating over the nodes of a graph where we need to find the origin and speed of propagation or the existence of multiple sources.\nWe demonstrate the efficiency of the DGW on real data by tracking the origin of earthquake events recorded by a network of sensors."}, {"heading": "II.

We will use the joint representation for the signal to characterize spectral relationships between the two domains and solve the PDE in the spectral domain obtaining an useful tool to analyze time-vertex signals that evolve according to this dynamic process. Finally, we will use the kernel to build the set of DGW. Because of the lack of translation invariance of graph, the kernel will always act in graph spectral domain and will be localized on the graph using the localization operator as in [8]. On the contrary the time dependence can be defined either in the spectral or in the time domain. In this contribution, we use for convenience the time domain."}, {"heading": "A. Heat diffusion on graph", "text": "Let us first provide a basic example for our model. The diffusion of heat on a graph can be seen as a simple dynamic process over a network.

Therefore, the heat diffusion spectral kernel is\nK\u0303(s\u03bb\u2113, t) = e \u2212s\u03bb\u2113t (5)\nwhere the parameter s is the thermal diffusivity in classic heat diffusion problems and can be interpreted as a scale parameter for multiscale dynamic graph wavelet analysis [9]. This equation models the spreading of a function on the graph over time. However, in the present work we want to focus on a propagating process, moving away from an initial point as time passes. Hence we introduce a second model."}, {"heading": "B. The wave equation on graphs", "text": "To model functions evolving on a graph, we will use mainly the PDE associated to the wave equation. Here, the wave equation is defined on the graph, and, as such, differs from the standard one. This partial differential equation relates the second order derivative in time to the spatial Laplacian operator of a function:\n(LT \u2297 IG)x = \u2212\u03b12(IT \u2297LG)x XLT = \u2212\u03b12LGX (6)\nwhere \u03b1 is the propagation speed parameter. Assuming a vanishing initial velocity, i.e. first derivative in time of the initial distribution equals zero, the solution to this PDE can be written using functional calculus as [14]:\nX( \u00b7 , t) = K(sLG, t)\u03c8 =Kt,s\u03c8 (7)\nwhere \u03c8(n) =X(n, 0) and Kt,s = K(sLG, t) is the matrix function K applied to the scaled Laplacian sLG and parametrized by the time t. Notice that we use the scale s = \u03b12 to represent the speed parameter of the propagation. Substituting (7) into (6), we obtain\nKt,s\u03c8LT = \u2212sLGKt,s\u03c8. (8)\nTo obtain a closed form solution for the kernel Ks we analyze the equation (8) in the graph spectral domain:\nK\u0303t,s\u03c8\u0303LT = \u2212s\u039bGK\u0303t,s\u03c8\u0303 (9)\nwhere K\u0303t,s = K(s\u039bG, t). Equation (9) requires K(s\u03bb\u2113, t) to be an eigenvector of LT . From (2) we obtain:\nK\u0303(s\u03bb\u2113, t) = cos\n( t arccos ( 1\u2212 s\u03bb\u2113\n2\n)) . (10)\nSince the arccos(x) is defined only for x \u2208 [\u22121, 1], to guarantee filter stability the parameter s must satisfy s < 4/\u03bbmax. This result is in agreement with stability analysis of numerical solver for discrete wave equation [15].\n3 The wave equation is a hyperbolic differential equation and several difficulties arise when discretizing it for numerical computation of the solution [14]. Moreover, the graph being an irregular domain, the solution of the above equation is not any more a smooth wave after few iterations. Here we focus on the propagation (away from its origin) of the wave rather than its exact expression."}, {"heading": "C.

Causal Damped Wave Dynamic Graph Kernel", "text": "We define the DGW to be the solutions of Eq. (6), for different \u03b1 = \u221a s. In addition, we require two other properties. Firstly, we want the wave to be causal, i.e. to have an initial starting point in time. Secondly, in many applications, the wave propagation is affected by an attenuation over time. We thus introduce a damping term. The DGW defined in the graph spectral domain is thus\nW\u0303s(\u03bb\u2113, t) = H(t) e\u2212\u03b2t cos ( t arccos ( 1\u2212 s\u03bb\u2113\n2\n)) , (12)\nwhere H(t) is the Heaviside function and e\u2212\u03b2t is the damped decaying exponential function in time.\nThe damping term has two remarkable effects. Firstly, it lower the importance of the chosen boundary conditions in time (e.g. periodic or reflective) as the wave vanishes before touching them.

The graph is constructed using the coordinates of the available seismic stations and connecting the closest nodes. We consider different seismic events whose epicenters were located in different areas of New Zealand1. Each waveform consists of 300 seconds sampled at 100Hz, starting few seconds before the seismic event. Seismic waveforms can be modeled as oscillating damped waves. This model is valid when the spatial domain where the waves are propagating is a continuous domain or a regular lattice [20]. Here, the domain is the network of sensors and we assume that a damped wave propagating on this network is still a good approximation. Thus we expect the waveforms of the DGW defined in Eq.(12) to be good approximations of the seismic waves recorded by the sensors. We create a frame of DGW, SW , using 10 different values for the propagation velocity parameter s linearly spaced between 0 and 2 (corresponding to physically plausible values). The damping \u03b2 was fixed and chosen to fit the damping present in the seismic signals.\nTo estimate the epicenter of the seismic event we solved the convex optimization problem (14). The sparse matrix C contains few non-zero coefficients corresponding to the waveforms that constitute the seismic wave. We averaged the coordinates of the vertices corresponding to the sources of the waves with highest energy coefficients. Figure 1 shows the results of the analysis for different seismic events. For each plot, the recorded waveforms are shown superposed using different colors. Real and estimated epicenters are shown respectively with a red square and a black circle on the graph plots.\nFinally, we investigated the performance of the source localization algorithm by adding white Gaussian noise to the signals, decreasing the SNR of the waveforms from 100 to 0 dB, such that the SNR is the same for all the waveforms. Table I shows the distance between the real and estimated epicenter in kilometers in four different events and increasing amounts of noise. The small variations of the results demonstrate the high robustness of the method.\n1The dataset is freely available at http://www.geonet.org.nz/quakes\n5"}], "references": [{"title": "The emerging field of signal processing on graphs: Extending high-dimensional data analysis to networks and other irregular domains", "author": ["David I Shuman", "Sunil K Narang", "Pascal Frossard", "Antonio Ortega", "Pierre Vandergheynst"], "venue": "Signal Processing Magazine, IEEE, vol. 30, no. 3, pp. 83\u201398, 2013.", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2013}, {"title": "Discrete signal processing on graphs", "author": ["Aliaksei Sandryhaila", "Jos\u00e9 MF Moura"], "venue": "Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on, vol. 61, no. 7, pp. 1644\u20131656, 2013.", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": null, "year": 2013}, {"title": "Epidemic processes in complex networks", "author": ["Romualdo Pastor-Satorras", "Claudio Castellano", "Piet Van Mieghem", "Alessandro Vespignani"], "venue": "Rev.

So far, the research efforts have been focused on static graph signals. However numerous applications involve graph signals evolving in time, such as spreading or propagation of waves on a network. The analysis of this type of data requires a new set of methods that fully takes into account the time and graph dimensions. We propose a novel class of wavelet frames named Dynamic Graph Wavelets, whose time-vertex evolution follows a dynamic process. We demonstrate that this set of functions can be combined with sparsity based approaches such as compressive sensing to reveal information on the dynamic processes occurring on a graph. Experiments on real seismological data show the efficiency of the technique, allowing to estimate the epicenter of earthquake events recorded by a seismic network.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software"}}}
