Albeit their compactness, inferring from these rules is a challenging task, which gave rise to a family of algorithms bundled under the name lifted inference, dedicated to exploiting the inherent symmetry exhibited by the compact representations. One of the popular lifted inference methods is an adaptation of the famous sum-product Belief-Propagation (BP) [21] algorithm to relational models [8, 16]. Based on a synchronous message passing schedule which exploits the symmetry of the relational model, lifted BP manages to compress huge probabilistic models into surprisingly small representations, while mimicking the BP behavior exactly.\nIn this paper we introduce the first domain-size independent framework which lifts the generalized BP algorithm (GBP) [21] in its classical message passing form, and thus allows the injection of more constraints on the marginals compared with non-generalized BP implementations. A related work by [18] introduced a method which produces similar approximations, by relaxing the relational model\u2019s structure [4], compensating for the relaxation and finally performing exact inference. Their implementation shows good results on many instances, however the method\u2019s execution time is still polynomial in the domain size. Our method, in contrast, is entirely domain-size independent (in case of no evidence), and does not rely on any external engine for inference.\nOur work heavily relies on a recently introduced graphical platform called Cluster Signature Graph (CSG) [2], which projects the relational structure of clusters of variables onto a graph, and allows symmetry detection via an isomorphism test. Based on this platform, we formulate a compact representation of the region graph, which is the graphical structure used for the GBP message passing. This lifted region graph is accompanied by a modified version of message passing, which mimics the GBP behavior in a respective ground model. The core reliance on a graphical representation enables us to frame most parts of this work in graphical terms, which are sometimes separate from terms used in similar lifted inference works. Nevertheless, this high-level perspective is what makes the framework capable of handling relational models of complex structure.\nWe begin with two background section, one introducing the GBP algorithm and related concepts, the other providing background on relational models and the CSG platform. The lifted GBP framework is presented next, starting with an overview, and continuing with the more formal parts of this work.

An atom is an atomic formula of the form p(t1, . . . , tn), where the symbol p is called a predicate1, and each term ti is either a domain object or an lvar. A ground atom is an atom whose ti terms are all domain objects. Non-ground atoms are collections of ground atoms, all sharing the same assignment range, and describing a certain property of an individual (e.g. smoker) or some relation between individuals (e.g. friendship).

Grounding a parfactor is done by applying all ground substitutions that are consistent with R, resulting in a collection of factors. The ground atoms then serve as random variables in the ground MRF.

(ii) The mapping induced by such an isomorphism constitutes a structure preserving permutation in the relational MRF. For lack of space, we present a simpler definition of CSG than the one introduced by [2], which captures slightly less symmetry and pertains to shattered models.\nDefinition 2 The CSG of cluster x\u03b1 is a directed colored multigraph G = (V,E,C), where V is a set of vertices, E is a set of directed edges and C is a coloring function, mapping each edge to a color. Edges and colors in the CSG are defined as follows. (1) For each member of x\u03b1 originating from a unary ground atom pi, let G contain a node i and a self-edge carrying the color \u2019p\u2019; (2) For each member of x\u03b1 originating from a binary ground atom r(i,j), let G contain the nodes i and j and a directed edge i \u2192 j carrying the color \u2019r\u2019.\nOne important feature of CSGs is that of canonical clusters. Canonical clusters are unique representatives for all clusters belonging to the same symmetry class. Each cluster x\u03b1 corresponds to a canonical representative x\u03b1\u2217 , that can be obtained by applying canonical labeling to the CSG of x\u03b1 using dedicated graph canonization tools (e.g. nauty [9]), and extracting the canonical cluster\u2019s variable members from the edges of the canonically labeled graph.\nSince CSGs consist only of cluster members, all related tasks (canonization, isomorphism tests, etc.) which are derived from this graphical representation are, at worst, exponential in the cluster size. This locality property is what makes the framework efficient and domain-size independent. Although CSGs are also capable of detecting symmetry in presence of evidence, we avoid this more complicated representation in this work, and will simply resort to the shattering of the model."}, {"heading": "4 Lifting the Generalized Belief Propagation", "text": "Lifting the generalized belief propagation can be regarded as a two stage process. First, given a relational MRF and a set of outer regions, a compact region graph is formed, entirely comprised of regions corresponding to canonical clusters. Second, a message passing algorithm, specifically adapted to the lifted graph, is applied, producing the exact same result as would the ground GBP. We begin with a short overview of the lifted framework."}, {"heading": "4.1 Lifted GBP \u2013 An Overview", "text": "Consider obtaining a region graph for the relational MRF \u03c6(p(X), q(Y )|X 6= Y ), where all pairs {pi, qj} (i 6= j) serve as outer regions. Such a graph can be obtained by finding all the intersections induced by the {pi, qj} pairs, and defining two edges from each pair to its members: {pi, qj} \u2192 pi and {pi, qj} \u2192 qj . However, the highly symmetric nature of the region graph allows to capture its structure much more succinctly, via a representation which simulates the description given above.\nWe first define symmetry in the context of region graphs. Regions \u03b1 and \u03b1\u2032 are said to be symmetrical if there exists a permutation \u03c0\nR on the region graph\u2019s nodes which preserves its structure, and\nunder which \u03c0 R (\u03b1) = \u03b1\u2032. Somewhat unsurprisingly, symmetry of regions is directly derived from the symmetry of their respective clusters. Here, all pairs {pi, qj} are symmetrical in the relational model, and thus so are the corresponding regions. The same applies to all the atomic p and q regions.\nAt this point, we would like to utilize the canonical representation of clusters to form a compact (lifted) region graph, comprised entirely of such clusters. Consider the cluster {pi, qj}, whose region will serve as a canonical representative for all pairs. Similarly, let pk and qm denote the canonical\nrepresentatives for the single atom regions. The lifted region graph should then consist of two edges: {pi, qj} \u2192 pk and {pi, qj} \u2192 qm. To represent the flow of messages from parent to child, each edge is accompanied by a mapping, expressing which \u201drole\u201d the child assumes w.r.t. the parent members. Here, the mapping pi 7\u2192 pk will be associated with one edge, and qj 7\u2192 qm will be associated with the other. Still, edges in the lifted graph must indicate how many symmetrical parents are connected to a single child, in the role specified by each edge. In our example, this cardinality is quite natural. If the domain size is N , then each pk is connected to N \u2212 1 parents from the {pi, qj} symmetry class under then role of pi, and each qm is connected to N \u2212 1 such parents under then role of qj .\nConsider now a slightly different model, consisting entirely of {pi, pj} pairs. Let all pairs {pi, pj} and all single pk instances be symmetrical. The lifted region graph must then consist of two nodes, {pi, pj} and pk, to denote the canonical representatives as before, but instead of two edges from {pi, pj} to pk, only one edge is required. The reason, which will be formalized in the next subsection, is that the special structure of the model forces messages being sent from each {pi, pj} to pi, to be entirely identical to those sent to pj . pk can then assume one of the roles pi or pj , arbitrarily, and still reflect correctly the message flow in the ground region graph.\nLastly, we wish to simulate message passing in the ground graph by sending messages in the lifted graph. Such simulation is possible if the messages in the ground graph are scheduled such that the graphical model\u2019s symmetry is reflected in the messages. This is indeed the case with the flooding schedule where, at each iteration, all nodes send messages at the exact same time. Under an assumption of initial message symmetry, if regions \u03b1 and \u03b2 are mapped to \u03b1\u2032 and \u03b2\u2032 by a structure preserving permutation, then at any iteration of the algorithm, messages from \u03b1 to \u03b2 remain symmetrical to those sent from \u03b1\u2032 to \u03b2\u2032. Consequently, there is no need for an explicit representation of both \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b1\u2032, \u03b2\u2032 in the lifted graph. We formalize this reasoning in the next subsection."}, {"heading": "4.2 Symmetry-Preserving Properties", "text": "The lifted GBP framework is based on two symmetry oriented properties. The first states that symmetry preserving permutations for the region graph are derived from the joint structure of the MRF and the set of chosen outer regions.

The method for identifying these lifted intersections is based on the following observation. Let the region graph consist of an edge \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2 between regions \u03b1 and \u03b2. Then, for each structure preserving permutation \u03c0\nR mapping \u03b1 to \u03b1\u2032, the region graph consists of an edge \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 \u03b2\u2032, where \u03b2\u2032 is the image of \u03b2 under\n\u03c0 R . Notably, intersections may exist between parent regions from different symmetry classes, or between parents of the same symmetry class. It is therefore convenient to approach this problem as a search over the canonical representations of all subsets in each of the regions.\nAlgorithm 1 depicts the generation of the lifted region graph2. The input of the algorithm is a set of indices of canonical clusters, which represent the outer regions. The output is the lifted region graph GR. The algorithm iterates over all subsets \u03b2 of size d \u2212 1 taken from regions of size d, starting with d as the size of the maximal outer region, and down to 2. A canonical representation \u03b2\u2217 for each such subset is obtained and added as a child region to the canonical parent, under (potentially) several distinct directed edges: one for each mapping from \u03b2 to \u03b2\u2217, where the mappings are derived from all isomorphisms of their respective CSGs. See Figures 1a and 1b for illustration.\nHowever, some mappings from subsets of a canonical parent \u03b1 to a canonical child \u03b2\u2217, must be filtered-out in order to maintain the lifted graph\u2019s correctness. If (not necessarily distinct) subsets of \u03b1, denoted by \u03b21 and \u03b22, map onto the same \u03b2\u2217 and their mappings indicate the existence of a structure preserving permutation which maps \u03b21 to \u03b22 while mapping \u03b1 to itself, then including both mappings as edges would result in over-counting the GBP messages. The existence of such a permutation can be detected via the following procedure. (i) Combine the mapping from \u03b21 to \u03b2\u2217 with the opposite mapping from \u03b22 to \u03b2\u2217, to produce a mapping from \u03b21 from \u03b22.

Therefore, subsets of \u03b1 which are symmetrical w.r.t. the global structure, may still affect \u03b1\u2019s belief state in a non-symmetrical way. To overcome this obstacle, we define the notion of a local graph. The local graph of canonical region \u03b1 is the set of all its (non-canonized) subsets, connected such as to form a region graph whose most top region is \u03b1 (see Figure 1c).\nBefore introducing the lifted messages, we define some related notations. \u223c x\u03b1\u2192\u03b2 denotes all x\u03b1 variables but those which take part in the mapping from \u03b1 to \u03b2. inEdges(\u03b1) denotes all \u03b1\u2019s incoming edges in the lifted region graph, where each such edge will be denoted by \u03c1 \u2192 \u03b1. localDesc(\u03b1) denotes all non-canonized subsets of \u03b1, \u03b3\u2217 denotes the canonical representation of a region \u03b3, and localPar(\u03b1, \u03b3, \u03c1\u2217 \u2192 \u03b3\u2217) denotes all members of \u03b1\u2019s local graph (including\u03b1) that are parents of \u03b3, and are connected via an edge in the local graph whose corresponding edge in the lifted region graph is \u03c1\u2217 \u2192 \u03b3\u2217. Lastly, the notation \u03c3(\u03b1\u2192\u03b2) : \u03c7 denotes the result of applying the mapping associated with the lifted edge \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2, to the variables of function \u03c7. The update rules of the lifted message passing are given by the following equations.\nb\u03b1(x\u03b1) \u221d \u220f\nf\u2208f\u03b1\n\u03c6f (xf ) \u220f\n(\u03c1\u2192\u03b1)\u2208inEdges(\u03b1)\nm\u03c1\u2192\u03b1(x\u03b1) \u03ba(\u03c1\u2192\u03b1) (5)\n\u220f\n\u03b3\u2208localDesc(\u03b1)\n\u03c3(\u03b3\u2217 7\u2192\u03b3) : \u220f\n(\u03c1\u2217\u2192\u03b3\u2217)\u2208inEdges(\u03b3\u2217)\nm\u03c1\u2217\u2192\u03b3\u2217(x\u03b3\u2217) \u03ba(\u03c1\u2217\u2192\u03b3\u2217)\u2212|localPar(\u03b1,\u03b3,\u03c1\u2217\u2192\u03b3\u2217)|\nm\u03b1\u2192\u03b2(x\u03b2) \u2190\u2212 \u03c3(\u03b1\u2192\u03b2) :\n\u2211\n\u223cx\u03b1\u2192\u03b2 b\u03b1(x\u03b1)\nb\u03b2(x\u03b2) m\u03b1\u2192\u03b2(x\u03b2) (6)\nFinding localPar(\u03b1, \u03b3, \u03c1\u2217 \u2192 \u03b3\u2217) can be non-trivial. One way to obtain this set of local regions is to \u201dreconstruct\u201d the procedure that associated \u03b3\u2217 with all its lifted parents, as follows. Let \u03c3(\u03b3\u2217 7\u2192\u03b3) denote a mapping from \u03b3\u2217 to \u03b3, derived from an isomorphism of their CSGs. We will define two sets of graphs G and G\u2217 such that the combination of isomorphisms from members of G to G\u2217 guarantees adequate matchings from all edges in \u03b1\u2019s local graph to those in the lifted graph. A distinct integer is associated with each member of \u03b3, 1 through |\u03b3|. Members of G are defined as the CSGs of all parents of \u03b3 in the local graph, modified such that edge colors of members of \u03b3 (e.g. \u2019r\u2019,\u2019p\u2019), are augmented by the associated integer (e.g. \u2019r = 1\u2019,\u2019p = 3\u2019).\nG\u2217 consists of one graph per each edge terminating in \u03b3\u2217 in the lifted region graph. Each such graph is a CSG with modified colors. More specifically, let \u03c1\u2217 \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 denote an edge in the lifted region graph whose associated mapping is \u03c3(\u03c1\u2217\u2192\u03b3\u2217). G\u2217 should then consist of the CSG of \u03c1\u2217, with colors that are modified according to a matching from the members of \u03c1\u2217 to the members of \u03b3. Matching from \u03c1\u2217 to \u03b3 is done by combining the mapping \u03c3(\u03c1\u2217\u2192\u03b3\u2217) with \u03c3(\u03b3\u2217 7\u2192\u03b3). If the mapped \u03b3 member consists of the color \u2019r = 1\u2019, so will the corresponding \u03c1\u2217 member. Lastly, a graph in G that is isomorphic with a graph in G\u2217, will be associated with the latter\u2019s edge. Figure 1c depicts the association of edges in a local graph obtained from the lifted region graph in Figure 1a."}, {"heading": "5 Empirical Evaluation", "text": "We conducted experiments on 4 structurally distinctive relational models. The first model is a friends smokers model (i.e. friends(X,Y ) \u2227 smokes(X) =\u21d2 smokes(Y )), the second is a transitive model [2], the third is a transitive friends knows model [1], and the forth is the chain model whose region graphs are depicted in Figure 1. Graph isomorphism tests were conducted using the NetworkX package [6]. The time required to generate the lifted graphs turned out to be in the range of tens of milliseconds. In all experiments, we ran 500 iterations of lifted GBP message passing with a damping factor of 0.5 and normalization of both beliefs and messages. Message computations were carried in log space in order to maintain numerical stability. Time performance and query results were compared against the WFOMC [19] engine, which is capable of computing GBP queries (Lifted RCR), as well as lifted BP (LBP). Lifted RCR times were normalized by reducing the time of respective LBP computations, thereby eliminating engine overhead of parsing and preprocessing from the comparison. Since our implementation is lightweight and domain size independent, it significantly dominates in time performance. Results of probabilistic queries were practically identical for RCR and our implementation. Notably, non-generalized lifted BP computations for the transitive model, return very similar results to GBP, and were omitted. The chain model, which does not appear in any of the figures, did not converge neither in RCR nor in our implementation."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "We introduced a lifted GBP message passing algorithm which is domain-size independent in shattered models. Although the scope of this work is confined to sum-product queries, the compact formulation of the lifted region graph may serve other algorithms which rely on a similar structure. One aspect worth exploring is extending the scope of outer regions, not only to regions defined using first-order theory, but also to all regions of a given size, similarly to lift and project hierarchies [15]. Such attempts may lead to tightened results and improved convergence in highly complex models."}], "references": [{"title": "Exploiting uniform assignments in first-order MPE", "author": ["U.
