Generally, in reordering approach, the source sentence is parsed (E) and syntactic reordering rules are applied to form reordered sentence (E\u2018). The training of SMT system is performed using a parallel corpus, having source side reordered (E\u2018) and target side. The decoding is done by supplying reordered source sentences. The source sentences prior to decoding are reordered using the same syntactic rules as applied to the training data. So, this process works as a preprocessing stage for the phrase-based SMT system. It has been observed that reordering as a preprocessing stage is beneficial for developing English-Hindi phrase-based SMT system (Ra-\nmanathan et al., 2008; Rama et al., 2014). This paper describes a rich set of rules for the structural transformation of English sentence in Hindi language structure using Stanford (De Marneffe et al., 2006) parse tree on the source side. These rules are manually extracted based on analysis of source sentence tree and Hindi translation.\nFor the evaluation purpose, we have trained and evaluated three different phrase-based SMT systems using MOSES toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) and GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003). The first system was non-reordered baseline (Brown et al., 1990; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003), second using limited reordering described in Ramanathan et al. (2008) and third using improved reordering technique proposed in the paper. Evaluation has been carried out for end to end EnglishHindi translation outputs using BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002), NIST score (Doddington, 2002), multi-reference position-independent word error rate (Tillmann et al., 1997), multi-reference word error rate (Nie\u00dfen et al., 2000). We have observed improvement in each of these evaluation metrics used. Next section discusses related work. Section 3 describes our reordering approach followed by experiments and results in section 4 and conclusion in section 5."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Various pre-processing approaches have been proposed for handling syntax within SMT systems. These proposed methods reconcile the wordorder differences between the source and target language sentences by reordering the source prior to the SMT training and decoding stages. For English-Hindi statistical machine translation, prior reordering is used by Ramanathan et al. (2008) and Rama et al. (2014). This approach (Ramanathan et al., 2008) has shown significant im-\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n07 42\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n4 O\nct 2\n01 6\nprovements over baseline (Brown et al., 1990; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003). With the reordering, the BLEU score for the system has increased from 12.10 to 16.90. The same reordering approach (Ramanathan et al., 2008) used by us (with the different test set), has shown a slight improvement in BLEU score of 0.64 over baseline i.e. BLEU score increased from 21.55 to 22.19 compare to +4.8 BLEU point increase in the previous case. The reason can be, when the system is able to get bigger chunks from the phrase table itself the local reordering (within the phrase) is not needed and the long distance reordering employed in the earlier approach will be helpful for overall better translation. It may not be able to show significant improvements when local reordering is not captured by the translation model.\nOther language pairs have also shown significant improvement when reordering is employed. Xia and McCord (2004) have observed improvement for French-English and Wang et al. (2007) for Chinese-English language pairs. Nie\u00dfen and Ney (2004) have proposed sentence restructuring whereas Collins et al. (2005) have proposed clause restructuring to improve German-English SMT. Popovic and Ney (2006) have also reported the use of simple local transformation rules for Spanish-English and Serbian-English translation. Recently, Khalilov and Fonollosa (2011) proposed a reordering technique using a deterministic approach for long distance reordering and nondeterministic approach for short distance reordering exploiting morphological information. Some reordering approaches are also presented exploiting the SMT itself (Gupta et al., 2012; Dlougach and Galinskaya, 2013). Various evaluation techniques are available for reordering and overall machine translation evaluation. Particularly for reordering, Birch et al. (2010) have proposed LRScore, a language independent metric for evaluating the lexical and word reordering quality. The translation evaluation metrics include BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), Meteor (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009), NIST (Doddington, 2002), etc."}, {"heading": "3 Reordering approach", "text": "Our reordering approach is based on a syntactic transformation of the English sentence parse tree according to the target language (Hindi) structure. It is similar to Ramanathan et al. (2008) but the transformation rules are not restricted to SVO to\nSOV and pre-modifier to postmodifier transformations only.\nThe idea was to come up with generic syntactic transformation rules to match the target language grammar structure. The motivation came from the fact that if words are already in a correct place with respect to other words in the sentence, the system doesnt need to do the extra work of reordering at the decoding time. This problem becomes even more complicated when the system is not able to get bigger phrases for translating a sentence. Assuming an 18-word sentence, if the system is able to get only 2-word length phrases, there are 362880 (9!) translations (permutations) possible (still ignoring the case where one phrase having more than one translation options) for a sentence.\nThe source and the target sentences are manually analyzed to derive the tree transformation rules. From the generated set of rules, we have selected rules which seemed to be more generic. There are cases where we have found more than one possible correct transformations for an English sentence as the target language (Hindi) is a free word order language within certain limits. In such cases, word order close to English structure is preferred over other possible word orders with respect to Hindi.\nWe identified 5 categories which are most prominent candidates for reordering. These include VPs (verb phrases), NPs (noun phrases), ADJPs (adjective phrase), PPs (preposition phrase) and ADVPs (adverb phrase). In the following subsections, we have described rules for these in more detail.\nThe format for writing the rules is as follows: Type of phrase (tag1 tag2 tag 3 : tag2 tag1 tag3). This means that tag1 tag2 tag3, structure has been transformed to tag2 tag1 tag3 for the type of phrase. This type of phrase denotes our category (NP, VP, ADJP, ADVP, PP) in which rule falls. The Table 1 explains about various tags and corresponding Penn-tags used in the writing these rules.\nThe following subsections explain the reordering rules. The higher precedence rule is written prior to the lower precedence. In general, the more specific rules have higher precedence. Each rule is followed by an example with intermediate steps of parsing and transformation as per the Hindi sentence structure. Partial Reordered\nshows the effect of the particular rule, whereas Reordered shows the impact of the whole reordering approach. The Hindi (transliterated) sentence is also provided as a reference to the corresponding English sentence."}, {"heading": "3.1 Noun Phrase Rules", "text": "NP (np1 PP [ prep NP [ np2 sbar]] :\nnp2 prep np1 sbar) (1)\nEnglish: The time of the year when nature dawns all its colorful splendor, is beautiful.\nParse: [NP (np1 the time) [PP (prep of) [NP (np2 the year) (sbar when nature dawns all its colorful splendor)]]] , is beautiful .\nPartial Reordered: (np2 the year) (prep of) (np1 the time) (sbar when nature dawns all its colorful splendor) , is beautiful .\nReordered: (np2 the year) (prep of) (np1 the time) (sbar when nature all its colorful splendor dawns) , beautiful is .\nHindi: varsh ka samay jab prakriti apne sabhi rang-birange vabahv failati hai, sundar hai.\nNP (np SBAR[ S[ dcP ]] : dcP np) (2)\nEnglish: September to march is the best season to visit Udaipur.\nParse: September to March is [NP (np the best season) [SBAR [S (dcP to visit Udaipur)]]] .\nPartial Reordered: September to March is (dcP to visit Udaipur) (np the best season) .\nReordered: September to March (dcP Udaipur visit to) (np the best season) is .\nHindi: september se march udaipur ghumane ka sabse achcha samay hai.\nNP (np punct advP : advP punct np) (3)\nEnglish: The modern town of Mumbai, about 50 km south of Navi Mumbai is Kharghar.\nParse: The modern town of [NP (np Mumbai) (punct ,) (advP about 50 km south of Navi Mumbai)] is Kharghar .\nPartial Reordered: (advP about 50 km south of Navi Mumbai)) (punct ,) (dcP The modern town of Mumbai) is kharghar .\nReordered: (advP Navi Mumbai of about 50 km south) (punct ,) (dcP Mumbai of the modern town) kharghar is .\nHindi: navi mumbai ke 50 km dakshin me mumbai ka adhunic sahar kharghar hai.\nNP ( np vp : vp np) (4)\nEnglish: The main attraction is a divine tree called as \u2019Kalptaru\u2019.\nParse: The main attraction is [NP (np a divine tree) (vp called as \u2019Kalptaru\u2019) ] .\nPartial Reordered: The main attraction is (vp\u2018 called as \u2019Kalptaru\u2019 ) (np a divine tree) .\nReordered: The main attraction (vp \u2018 Kalptaru\u2019 as called) (np a divine tree) is .\nHindi: iska mukhya akarshan kalptaru namak ek divya vriksh hai."}, {"heading": "3.2 Verb Phrase Rules", "text": "V P ( vpw PP [ prep NP [ np punct?

Hindi: kya kalajar dhup ke karan hota hai?"}, {"heading": "4 Experiments and Results", "text": "The experiments were carried out on the corpus described in Table 2 below.\nThe baseline system was setup by using the phrase-based model (Brown et al., 1990; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003). For the language model, we carried out experiments and found in a comparison that 5-gram model with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1996) to be the best performing. Target Hindi corpus from the training set was used for creating the language model. The KenLM (Heafield, 2011) toolkit was used for the language modeling experiments. The tuning corpus was used to set weights for the language models, distortion model, phrase translation model, etc., using minimum error rate training (Och and Ney, 2003). Decoding was performed using the MOSES decoder. Stanford constituency parser (De Marneffe et al., 2006) was used for parsing.\nTable 4 describes with the help of an 1example how the reordering and hence the translation quality has improved. From the example, it can be seen that the translation of the system using our approach is better than the other two systems. The output translation is structurally more correct in\n1All hindi words have been written in Itrans using http: //sanskritlibrary.org/transcodeText.html\nour approach and conveys the same meaning with respect to the reference translation.\nThe Table 3 lists four different evaluations of the systems under study. For BLEU and NIST higher score is considered as better and for mWER and the mPER lower score is desirable. Table 3 shows the results of comparative evaluation of baseline, limited reordering and our approach with improved reordering. We find that the addition of more reordering rules shows substantial improvements over the baseline phrase-based system and the limited reordering system (Ramanathan et al., 2008). The impact of improved syntactic reordering can be seen as the BLEU and NIST scores have increased, whereas mWER and mPER scores have decreased.\nTable 5 shows the count of overall phrases and distinct phrases (distinct on the source) for baseline, limited reordering approach, and our improved reordering approach. The table also shows an increase over baseline (IOBL) and percentage increase over baseline(%IOBL) for limited reordering and improved reordering. We have observed that no. of distinct phrases extracted from the training corpus get increased. The %IOBL for bigger phrases is more compared to shorter\nphrases. This can be attributed to the better alignments resulting in the extraction of more phrases (Koehn et al., 2003).\nWe have also observed that the overall increase is even lesser than the increase in no. of distinct phrases (distinct on the source) for all the phraselengths in our approach (e.g. 42613 and 45405 for phrase-length 2) which shows that reordering makes word alignments more consistent and reduces multiple entries for the same source phrase. The training was done on maximum phrase length 7(default)."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "It can be seen that the addition of more reordering rules improves translation quality. As of now, we have tried these rules only for English-Hindi pair, but the plan is to employ similar reordering rules in other English-Indian language pairs as most Indian languages are structurally similar to Hindi.
