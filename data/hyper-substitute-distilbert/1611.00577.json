INTRODUCTION", "text": "There are many methods for solving nonlinear constrained programming problems such as Newton, Genetic algorithm, the algorithm of birds and so on. In this paper using the emerging Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm and simple additive weighting a method to solve multi-objective problems is presented.\nIn single-objective optimization, it is assumed that the decision makers communicate only with one goal like: profit maximization, cost minimization, waste minimization, share minimization and so on. But in the real world it is not possible to consider single goals and usually more than one goal are examined. For example, in the control of the projects if only the time factor is considered, other objectives such as cost and quality are ignored and the results are not reliable. So it is necessary to use multi-objective optimization problems.\nEhrgott and Gandibleux presented a detailed approximation method regarding the problems related to combinatorial multi-objective optimization [1]. Klein and Hannan for multiple objective integer linear programming problems (MOILP) presented and algorithm in which some additional restrictions is used to remove the known dominant solutions [2]. Sylva and Crema offered a method to find the set of dominant vectors in multiple objective integer linear programming problems [3]. Arakawa et al. used combined general data envelopment analysis and Genetic Algorithm to produce efficient frontier in multi-objective optimization problems [4].\nDeb analyzed the solution of multi-objective problems by evolutionary algorithms [5]. Reyesseerra and Coello Coello analyzed the solution of multi-objective problems by particle swarm [6]. Cooper et al. have worked on the solution of multi-objective problems by the DEA and presenting\nan application [7]. Pham and Ghanbarzadeh solved multi-objective problems by bee algorithm [8]. Nebro et al. analyzed a new method based on particle swarm algorithm for solving multiobjective optimization problems [9]. Gorjestani et al. proposed a COA multi objective algorithm using DEA method [10].\nFor multi-objective optimization problems usually it is not possible to obtain the optimal solution that simultaneously optimizes all the targets in question. Therefore we should try to find good solutions rather than the optimal ones known as Pareto frontier. Given that so far the Simple Additive Weighting method is not used in meta-heuristic, especially cuckoo algorithms, this paper presents a combined method.\nThe first section introduces Cuckoo optimization algorithm, then in the second section Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method is discussed as a combined method for solving multiobjective described. Finally, the fourth section provides the proposed implemented approach, numerical results and a comparison which is made with other methods."}, {"heading": "2. CUCKOO OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM", "text": "Cuckoo optimization algorithm was developed by Xin-She Yang and Suash Deb in 2009. Thence Cuckoo optimization algorithm was presented by Ramin Rajabioun in 2011 [11]. Cuckoo algorithm flowchart is as figure 1. This algorithm applied in several researches such as production planning problem [12], portfolio selection problem [13], evaluation of organization efficiency [14], evaluation of COA [15] and so on. For more information about the algorithm refer to [11]."}, {"heading": "3. SIMPLE ADDITIVE WEIGHTING METHOD", "text": "SAW is one of the most practical methods designed for decision-making with multiple criteria presented by Hong and Eun in 1981. In this method which is also known as weighted linear combination after scaling the decision matrix by weighted coefficients of criteria, the free scale weighted decision matrix id obtained and according to this scale the score of each option is selected. The most important feature of this method is the simple application because of its mathematical logic.\nAssuming the multiple target model (1) and defining the parameters w1 and w2 which are the weight of the objective functions and defined based on the importance of the functions by the decision maker, the model can be converted to single-objective models (2):\nMax F(x)=( , , \u2026 . , (1) s.t. \u2264 \u2265 0 Max F(x)= + +\u22ef+\n(2) + +\u22ef+ = 1\nIn these models x \u2026 x are objective functions. is the weight defined by the importance of the decision maker."}, {"heading": "4.
