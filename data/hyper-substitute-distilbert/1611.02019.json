If we consider human activities for example, GPS values from a mobile phone, navigation traces over the Internet, or even photos published on social networks are different views on a particular user. In multimedia applications, views can correspond to different modalities (Atrey et al., 2010) such as sounds, images, videos, sequences of previous frames, etc...\nThe problem of multi-view machine learning has been extensively studied during the last decade, mainly from the classification point of view. In that case, one wants to predict an output y based on multiple views acquired on an unknown object x. Different strategies have been explored but a general common idea is based on the (early or late) fusion of the different views at a particular level of a deep architecture (Wang et al., 2015; Ngiam et al., 2011; Srivastava & Salakhutdinov, 2012).\nThe existing literature mainly explores problems where outputs are chosen in a discrete set (e.g categorization), and where all the views are available. An extension of this problem is to consider the density estimation problem where one wants to estimate the conditional probabilities of the outputs given the available views. As noted by Mathieu et al. (2015), minimizing classical prediction losses (e.g Mean square error) will not capture the different output distribution modalities.\nIn this article, we propose a new model able to estimate a distribution over the possible outputs given any subset of views on a particular input. This model is based on the (Bidirectional) Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGAN) formalism. More precisely, we bring two main contributions: first, we propose the CV-BiGAN (Conditional Views BiGAN \u2013 Section 3) architecture that allows one to model a conditional distribution P (y|.) in an original way. Second, on top of this architecture, we build the Multi-view BiGANs (MV-BiGAN \u2013 Section 4) which is able to both predict when only one or few views are available, and to update its prediction if new views are added. We evaluate this model on different multi-views problems and different datasets (Section 5).

But we consider instead a multi-view problem in which different views on x are available, x being unknown. Let us denote V the number of possible views and x\u0303k the k-th view over x. The description space for view k is Rnk where nk is the size of this space. Moreover, we consider that some of the V views can be missing.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been introduced by Goodfellow et al. (2014) and have demonstrated their ability to model complex distributions. They have been used to produce compelling natural images from a simple latent distribution (Radford et al., 2015; Denton et al., 2015). Exploring the latent space has uncovered interesting, meaningful patterns in the resulting outputs. However, GANs lack the ability to retrieve a latent representation given an output, missing out an opportunity to exploit the learned manifold. Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGANs) have been proposed by Donahue et al. (2016) and Dumoulin et al. (2016), independently, to fill that gap. BiGANs simultaneously learn both an encoder function E that models the encoding process PE(z|y) from the space Rn to a latent space RZ , and a generator function G that models the mapping distribution PG(y|z) of any latent point z \u2208 RZ to a possible object y \u2208 Rn. From both the encoder distribution and the generator distribution, we can model two joint distributions, respectively denoted PE(y, z) and PG(y, z):\nPG(y, z) = P (z)PG(y|z) PE(y, z) = P (y)PE(z|y)\n(1)\nassuming that P (z) = N (0, 1) and P (y) can be estimated over the training set by a uniform sampling. The BiGAN framework also introduces a discriminator network D1 whose task is to determine whether a pair (y, z) is sampled from pG(y, z) or from pE(y, z), whileE andG are trained to fool D1, resulting in the following learning problem:\nmin G,E max D1 Ey\u223cP (y),z\u223cPE(z|y) [logD1(y, z)] + Ez\u223cP (z),y\u223cPG(y|z) [1\u2212 logD1(y, z)] (2)\nIt can be shown, by following the same steps as in Goodfellow et al. (2014), that the optimization problem described in Equation 2 minimizes the Jensen-Shanon divergence between PE(y, z) and PG(y, z), allowing the model to learn both a decoder and a generator over a training set that will model the joint distribution of (y, z) pairs. As proposed by Dumoulin et al. (2016), we consider in the following that PG(y|z) is modeled by a deterministic non-linear model G so that G(z) = y, and PE as a diagonal Gaussian distribution E(z) = (\u00b5(y), \u03c3(y)). G, \u00b5 and \u03c3 are estimated by using gradient-based descent techniques."}, {"heading": "2.3 GENERAL IDEA", "text": "We propose a model based on the Generative Adversarial Networks paradigm adapted to the multiview prediction problem. Our model is based on two different principles:\nConditional Views BiGANs (CV-BiGAN): First, since one wants to model an output distribution based on observations, our first contribution is to propose an adaptation of BiGANs to model conditional probabilities, resulting in a model able to learn P (y|x\u0303) where x\u0303 can be either a single view or an aggregation of multiple views. If conditional GANs have already been proposed in the literature (see Section 6) they are not adapted to our problem which require explicit mappings between input space to latent space, and from latent space to output space.\nMulti-View BiGANs (MV-BiGAN): On top of the CV-BiGAN model, we build a multi-view model able to estimate the distribution of possible outputs based on any subset of views v(s, x). If a natural way to extend the Conditional BiGANS for handling multi-view is to define a mapping function which map the set of views to a representation space (see Section 4.1) the resulting model has shown undesirable behaviors (see Section 5.1). Therefore, we propose to constrain the model based on the idea that adding one more view to any subset of views must decrease the uncertainty on the output distribution i.e the more views are provided, the less variance the output distribution has. This behavior is encouraged by using a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) regularization (see Section 4.2)."}, {"heading": "3 THE CONDITIONAL BIGAN MODEL (CV-BIGAN)", "text": "Our first objective is to extend the BiGAN formalism to handle an input space (e.g a single observed view) in addition to the output space Rn. We will denote x\u0303 the observation and y the output to predict. In other words, we wish to capture the conditional probability P (y|x\u0303) from a given training dataset. Assuming one possesses a bidirectional mapping between the input space and an associated representation space, ie. PE(z|y) and PG(y|z), one can equivalently capture P (z|x\u0303). The CV-BiGAN model keeps the encoder E and generator G defined previously but also includes an additional encoder function denoted H which goal is to map a value x\u0303 to the latent space RZ . Applying H on any value of x\u0303 results in a distribution PH(z|x\u0303) = N (\u00b5H(x\u0303), \u03c3H(x\u0303)) so that a value of z can be sampled from this distribution. This would then allow one to recover a distribution P (y|x\u0303). Given a pair (x\u0303, y), we wish a latent representation z sampled from PH(z|x\u0303) to be similar to one from PE(z|y). As our goal here is to learn P (z|x\u0303), we define two joint distributions between x\u0303 and z:\nPH(x\u0303, z) = PH(z|x\u0303)P (x\u0303) PE(x\u0303, z) = \u2211 y PE(z|y)P (x\u0303, y) (3)\nMinimizing the Jensen-Shanon divergence between these two distributions is equivalent to solving the following adversarial problem:\nmin E,H max D2 Ex\u0303,y\u223cp(x\u0303,y),z\u223cpE(z|y) [logD2(x\u0303, z)] + Ex\u0303,y\u223cp(x\u0303,y),z\u223cpH(z|x) [1\u2212 logD2(x\u0303, z)] (4)\nNote that when applying stochastic gradient-based descent techniques over this objective function, the probability P (x\u0303, y) is approximated by sampling uniformly from the training set.

In order to stabilize our model, we propose to add a regularization based on the idea that adding new views to an existing subset of views should reduce the uncertainty over the outputs. Indeed, under the assumption that views are consistent one another,\n1 Note that other aggregation scheme can be used like recurrent neural networks for example.\nadding a new view should allow to refine the predictions and reduce the variance of the distribution of the outputs.\nLet us consider an object x and two index vectors s and s\u2032 such that v(x, s) \u2282 v(x, s\u2032) ie. \u2200k, s\u2032k \u2265 sk.

We also find that we can update all the modules in one pass instead of taking alternate gradient steps while obtaining similar results.\nNote that the MV-BiGAN model is trained based on datasets where all the V views are available for each data point. In order to generate examples where only subsets of views are available, the ideal procedure would be to consider all the possible subsets of views.

One can see that the attribute information has been captured by the model: for example, the sex of the generated face is constant (only women) showing that MV-BiGan has captured this information from the attribute vector. The second line corresponds to the faces generated when using the incomplete face as an input. One can also see that the generated outputs are \u201dcompatible\u201d with the incomplete information provided to the model.

For example, in the multimedia domain, dealing with a bunch of views is usual (Atrey et al., 2010): text, audio, images (different framings from videos) are starting points of these views. Besides, multimedia learning tasks from multi-views led to a large amount of fusionbased ad-hoc approaches and experimental results. The success of multi-view supervised learning approaches in the multimedia community seems to rely on the ability of the systems to deal with the complementary of the information carried by each modality. Comparable studies are of importance in many domains, such as bioinformatics (Sokolov & Ben-Hur, 2011), speech recognition (Arora & Livescu, 2012; Ko\u00e7o et al., 2012), signal-based multimodal integration (Wu et al., 1999), gesture recognition (Wu et al., 2013), etc.\nMoreover, multi-view learning has been theoretically studied mainly under the semi-supervised setting, but only with two facing views (Chapelle et al., 2006; Sun, 2013; Sun & Taylor, 2014; Johnson & Zhang, 2015). In parallel, ensemble-based learning approaches have been theoretically studied, in the supervised setting: many interesting results should concern multi-view learning, as long as the ensemble is built upon many views (Rokach, 2010; Zhang & Zhang, 2011). From the representation learning point of view, recent models are based on the incorporation of some \u201dfusion\u201d layers in the deep neural network architecture as in (Ngiam et al., 2011) or (Srivastava & Salakhutdinov, 2012) for example. Some other interesting models include the multiview perceptron(Zhu et al., 2014).\nEstimating Complex Distributions: While deep learning has shown great results in many classification task for a decade, training deep generative models still remains a challenge. Deep Boltzmann Machines (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009) are un-directed graphical models organized in a succession of layers of hidden variables. In a multi-view setting, they are able to deal with missing views and have been used to capture the joint distribution in bi-modal text and image data (Srivastava & Salakhutdinov, 2012; Sohn et al., 2014). Another trend started with denoising autoencoder (Vincent et al., 2008), which aims to reconstruct a data from a noisy input have been proved to possess some desirable properties for data generation (Bengio et al., 2013). The model have been generalized under the name Generative Stochastic Networks by replacing the noise function C with a mapping to a latent space (Thibodeau-Laufer et al., 2014). Pulling away from the mixing problems encountered in previous approaches, Variational Autoencoders (Kingma & Welling, 2013) attempts to map the input distribution to a latent distribution which is easy to sample from. The model is trained by optimizing a variational bound on the likelihood, using stochastic gradient descent methods. The Kullback-Leibler regularizer on the latent Gaussian representations used in our model is reminiscent of the one introduced in the variational lower bound used by the VAE.\nThe BiGAN model (Donahue et al., 2016; Dumoulin et al., 2016) that serves as a basis for our work is an extension of the Generative Adversarial Nets (Goodfellow et al., 2014). A GAN extension that captures conditional probabilities (CGAN) has been proposed in (Mirza & Osindero, 2014). However, as noted by (Mathieu et al., 2015) and (Pathak et al., 2016), they display very unstable behavior. More specifically, CGAN have been able to generate image of faces conditioned on an attribute vector (Gauthier, 2014), but fail to model image distribution conditioned on a part of the image or on previous frames. By using a mapping between the output space and a latent space, CV-BiGAN allow us to bypass this difficulty by working at a latent level instead."}, {"heading": "7 CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES", "text": "We have proposed the CV-BiGAN model for estimating conditional densities, and its extension MV-BiGAN to handle multi-view inputs.

In that case, one wants to predict an output y based on multiple views acquired on an unknown object x. Different strategies have been explored but a general common idea is based on the (early or late) fusion of the different views at a particular level of a deep architecture (Wang et al., 2015; Ngiam et al., 2011; Srivastava & Salakhutdinov, 2012). The existing literature mainly explores problems where outputs are chosen in a discrete set (e.g categorization), and where all the views are available.
