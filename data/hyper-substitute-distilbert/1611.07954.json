In particular, the entities and events should not be mentioned in structured databases of general knowledge. Reading comprehension problems are intended to measure a systems ability to extract semantic information about entities and relations directly from unstructured text. Several large scale reading comprehension datasets have been introduced recently. In particular the CNN & DailyMail datasets (Hermann et al., 2015), the Children\u2019s Book Test (CBT) (Hill et al., 2016), and the Who-did-What dataset (Onishi et al., 2016). The large sizes of these datasets enable the application of deep learning. These are all cloze-style datasets where a question is constructed by deleting a word or phrase from an article summary (in CNN/DailyMail), from a sentence in a Children\u2019s story (in CBT), or by deleting a person from the first sentence of a different news article on the same entities and events (in Who-did-What).\nA variety of neural models for machine comprehension (neural readers) have been developed recently. Here we divide these readers into two classes \u2014 aggregation readers and explicit reference readers. Aggregation readers compute a vector representation of the passage involving a questionsensitive attention. They then select an answer based on the passage vector. Aggregation readers include Memory Networks (Weston et al.; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015), the Attentive Reader (Hermann et al., 2015) and the Stanford Reader (Chen et al., 2016).\nExplicit reference readers, on the other hand, avoid computing a vector representation of the passage. Instead they rely on a kind of coreference annotation \u2014a specification at each position in the passage of whether or not that position references a candidate answer, and if so, which answer is referenced. These readers compute an attention, as in aggregation readers, but rather than compute a passage vector they simply select the most attended-to answer. Explicit reference readers include the Attention Sum Reader (Kadlec et al., 2016), the Gated Attention Reader (Dhingra et al., 2016), the Attention-over-Attention Reader (Cui et al., 2016) and others (a list can be found in section 6).\n\u2217Authors contributed equally 1code will be available: https://github.com/sohuren\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n07 95\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n3 N\nov 2\n01 6\nSomewhat surprisingly, aggregation readers can perform as well as explicit reference readers. Here we analyze how this happens and argue for the emergence of logical structure in aggregation readers.\nIn all of these models a hidden state vector is computed for each position in the passage. We propose that the hidden state vector represents a direct sum of a \u201cstatement vector\u201d and an \u201centity vector\u201d. This logical structure can be written as H = S \u2295 E where H is the space of hidden vectors and S and E are orthogonal subspaces corresponding to \u201cstatements\u201d and \u201centities\u201d respectively. We then have that a hidden vector h has a unique decomposition as h = \u03a6 + e. We interpret this as saying that statement \u03a6 is true of entity e.\nSections 2 and 3 review various existing datasets and models respectively. Section 4 presents the logical structure interpretation of aggregation readers and the empirical evidence supporting it. Section 5 proposes new models that enforce the direct sum structure of the hidden state vectors. It is shown that these new models perform well on the Who-did-What dataset provided that reference annotations are added as input features. Section 5 also describes additional linguistic features that can be added to the input embeddings and show that these improve performance of existing models resulting in the best single-model performance to date on the Who-did-What datasets."}, {"heading": "2 A BRIEF SURVEY OF DATASETS", "text": "Before presenting various models for machine comprehension we give a general formulation of the machine comprehension task. We take an instance of the task be a four tuple (q, p, a,A), where q is a question given as sequence of words containing a special taken for a \u201cblank\u201d to be filled in, p is a document consisting of a sequence of words, A is a set of possible answers and a \u2208 A is the ground truth answer. All words are drawn from a vocabulary V . We assume that all possible answers are words from the vocabulary, that is A \u2286 V , and that the ground truth answer appears in the document, that is a \u2208 p. The problem can be described as that of selecting the answer a \u2208 A that answers question q based on information from p.\nWe will now briefly summarize important features of the related datasets in reading comprehension.\nCNN & DailyMail: Hermann et al. (2015) constructed these datasets from a large number of news articles from the CNN and Daily Mail news websites. The main article is used as the context, while the cloze style question is formed from one short highlight sentence appearing in conjunction with the published article. To avoid the model using external world knowledge when answering the question, the named entities in the entire dataset were replaced by anonymous entity IDs which were then further shuffled for each example. This forces models to rely on the context document to answer each question. In this anonymized corpus the entity identifiers are taken to be a part of the vocabulary and the answer set A consists of the entity identifiers occurring in the passage. Who-did-What (WDW): The Who-did-What dataset (Onishi et al., 2016) contains 127,000 multiple choice cloze questions constructed from the LDC English Gigaword newswire corpus (David & Cieri, 2003). In contrast with CNN and Daily Mail, it avoids using article summaries for question formation. Instead, each problem is formed from two independent articles: one is given as the passage to be read and a different article on the same entities and events is used to form the question. Further, Who-did-What avoids anonymization, as each choice is a person named entity. In this dataset the answer set A consists of the person named entities occurring in the passage. Finally, the problems have been filtered to remove a fraction that are easily solved by simple baselines. It has two training sets. The larger training set (\u201crelaxed\u201d) is created using less baseline filtering, while the smaller training set (\u201cstrict\u201d) uses the same filtering as the validation and test sets.\nChildren\u2019s Book Test (CBT) Hill et al. (2016) developed the CBT dataset in a slightly different fashion to the CNN/DailyMail datasets. They take any sequence of 21 consecutive sentences from a children\u2019s book: the first 20 sentences are used as the passage, and the goal is to infer a missing word in the 21st sentence. The task complexity varies with the type of the omitted word (verb, preposition, named entity, or common noun). According to the original study on this dataset (Hill et al., 2016), n-gram and recurrent neural network language models are sufficient for predicting verbs or prepositions. However, for named entities and common nouns, current solvers are still far from human performance.\nOther Related Datasets. It is also worth mentioning several related datasets. The MCTest dataset (Richardson et al., 2013) consists of children\u2019s stories and questions written by crowdsourced workers. The dataset only contains 660 documents and is too small to train deep models. The bAbI dataset (Weston et al., 2016) is constructed automatically using synthetic text generation and can be perfectly answered by hand-written algorithms (Lee et al., 2016). The SQuAD dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) consists passage-question pairs where the passage is a wikipedia article and the questions are written by crowdsourced workers. Although crowdsourcing is involved, the dataset contains over 200,000 problems. But the answer is often a word sequence which is dificult to handle with the reader models considered here. The LAMBADA dataset (Denis et al., 2016) is a word prediction dataset which requires a broad discourse context and the correct answer might not in the context. Nonetheless, when the correct answer is in the context, neural readers can be applied effectively (Chu et al., 2016)."}, {"heading": "3 AGGREGATION READERS AND EXPLICIT REFERENCE READERS", "text": "Here we classify readers into aggregation readers and explicit reference readers. Aggregation readers appeared first in the literature and include Memory Networks (Weston et al.; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015), the Attentive Reader (Hermann et al., 2015), and the Stanford Reader (Chen et al., 2016). Aggregation readers are defined by equations (4) and (6) below. Explicit reference readers incluce the Attention-Sum Reader (Kadlec et al., 2016), the Gated-Attention Reader (Dhingra et al., 2016), and the Attention-over-Attention Reader (Cui et al., 2016). Explicit reference readers are defined by equation (10) below. We first present the Stanford Reader as a paradigmatic aggregation Reader and the Attention-Sum Reader as a paradigmatic explicit reference reader."}, {"heading": "3.1 AGGREGATION READERS", "text": "Stanford Reader. The the Stanford Reader (Chen et al., 2016) computes a bi-directional LSTM representation of both the passage and the question.\nh = biLSTM(e(p)) (1) q = [fLSTM(e(q))|q|, bLSTM(e(q))1] (2)\nIn equations (1) and (2) we have that e(p) is the sequence of word embeddings e(wi) for wi \u2208 p and similarly for e(q). The expression biLSTM(s) denotes the sequence of hidden state vectors resulting from running a bi-directional LSTM on the vector sequence s. We write biLSTM(s)i for the ith vector in this sequence. Similarly fLSTM(s) and bLSTM(s) denote the sequence of vectors resulting from running a forward LSTM and a backward LSTM respectively and [\u00b7, \u00b7] denotes vector concatenation. The Stanford Reader, and various other readers, then compute a bilinear attention over the passage which is then used to construct a single weighted vector representation of the passage.\n\u03b1t = softmax t\nh>t W\u03b1 q (3) o = \u2211 t \u03b1tht (4)\nFinally, they compute a probability distribution over the answers P (a|p, q,A).\np(a|d, q,A) = softmax a\u2208A eo(a) >o (5)\na\u0302 = argmax a\u2208A\neo(a) >o (6)\nHere eo(a) is an \u201coutput embedding\u201d of the answer a. On the CNN dataset the Stanford Reader trains an output embedding for each the roughly 500 entity identifiers used in the dataset. In cases where the answer might be any word in V an output embedding must be trained for the entire vocabulary. The reader is trained with log-loss ln 1/P (a|p, q,A) where a is the correct answer. At test time the reader is scored on the percentage of problems where a\u0302 = a.\nMemory Networks. Memory Networks (Weston et al.; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) use (4) and (6) but have more elaborate methods of constructing \u201cmemory vectors\u201d ht not involve LSTMs. Memory\nnetworks use (4) and (6) but replace (5) with\nP (w|p, q,A) = P (w|p, q) = softmax w\u2208V eo(w) T o. (7)\nIt should be noted that (7) trains output vectors over the whole vocabulary rather than just those items occurring in the choice setA. This is empirically significant in non-anonymized datasets such as CBT and Who-did-What where choices at test time may never have occurred as choices in the training data.\nAttentive Reader. The Stanford Reader was derived from the Attentive Reader (Hermann et al., 2015). The Attentive Reader uses \u03b1t = softmaxt MLP([ht, q]) instead of (3). Here MLP(x) is the output of a multi layer perceptron (MLP) given input x. Also, the answer distribution in the attentive reader is defined over the full vocabulary rather than just the candidate answer set A.\nP (w|p, q,A) = P (w|p, q) = softmax w\u2208V eo(w) TMLP([o, q]) (8)\nEquation (8) is similar to (7) in that it leads to the training of output vectors for the full vocabulary rather than just those items appearing in choice sets in the training data. As in memory networks, this leads to improved performance on non-anonymized data sets."}, {"heading": "3.2 EXPLICIT REFERENCE READERS", "text": "Attention-Sum Reader. In the Attention-Sum Reader (Kadlec et al., 2016) h and q are computed with equations (1) and (2) as in the Stanford Reader but using GRUs rather than LSTMs. The attention \u03b1t is computed similarly to (3) but using a simple inner product \u03b1t = softmaxt h>t q rather than a trained bilinear form. Most significanlty, however, equations (5) and (6) are replaced by the following where t \u2208 R(a, p) indicates that a reference to candidate answer a occurs at position t in p.\nP (a|p, q,A) = \u2211\nt\u2208R(a,p)\n\u03b1t (9)\na\u0302 = argmax a \u2211 t\u2208R(a,p) \u03b1t (10)\nHere we think of R(a, p) as the set of references to a in the passage p. It is important to note that (9) is an equality and that P (a|p, q,A) is not normalized to the members of R(a, p). When training with the log-loss objective this drives the attention \u03b1t to be normalized \u2014 to have support only on the positions t with t \u2208 R(a, p) for some a. See the heat maps in the appendix. Gated-Attention Reader. The Gated Attention Reader Dhingra et al. (2016) involves a K-layer biGRU architecture defined by the following equations.\nq` = [fGRU(e(q))|q|, bGRU(e(q))1] 1 \u2264 ` \u2264 K h1 = biGRU(e(p))\nh` = biGRU(h`\u22121 q`\u22121) 2 \u2264 ` \u2264 K Here the question embeddings q` for different values of ` are computed with different GRU model parameters. Here h q abbreviates the sequence h1 q, h2 q, . . . h|p| q. Note that for K = 1 we have only q1 and h1 as in the attention-sum reader. An attention is then computed over the final layer hK with \u03b1t = softmaxt (hKt ) > qK in the attention-sum reader. This reader uses (9) and (10).\nAttention-over-Attention Reader, The Attention-over-Attention Reader (Cui et al., 2016) uses a more elaborate method to compute the attention \u03b1t. We will use t to range over positions in the passage and j to range over positions in the question. The model is then defined by the following equations.\nh = biGRU(e(p)) q = biGRU(e(q))\n\u03b1t,j = softmaxt h > t qj \u03b2t,j = softmaxj h > t qj\n\u03b2j = 1 |p| \u2211 t \u03b2t,j \u03b1t = \u2211 j \u03b2j\u03b1t,j\nNote that the final equation defining \u03b1t can be interpreted as applying the attention \u03b2j to the attentions \u03b1t,j . This reader uses (9) and (10)."}, {"heading": "4 EMERGENT LOGICAL STRUCTURE", "text": "Our logical structure interpretation was inspired by the anonymization done in the CNN/DailyMail dataset. To undermine the use of language models the named entities in this data set are replaced by anonymous entity identifiers such as ent381. After anonymization a typical sentence might be \u201cthe ent381 producer allegedly struck by ent212 will not press charges against the ent153 host\u201d. Furthermore, at training time these identifiers are typically randomly shuffled so that the same problem can be used at training time under different mappings between the actual named entities and the identifiers that replace them. Clearly the identifiers themselves cannot be assigned any semantics other than their identity. We can think of them as pointers or semantics-free constant symbols. Despite this undermining of semantics, aggregation readers using (4) and (6) are able to perform well. This indicates that the vector o appearing in (5) and (6) contains some kind of \u201cpointer\u201d to the desired entity identifier. More specifically, it seems natural to assume that for t \u2208 R(a, p) we have that the hidden vector ht of the Stanford Reader has a strong inner product with eo(a) and a weak inner product with eo(a\u2032) for a\u2032 6= a. This suggests the following for some fixed positive constant c.\neo(a) >ht = { c if t \u2208 R(a, p) 0 otherwise (11)\nThis gives\nargmax a\neo(a) >o = argmax\na eo(a) > \u2211 t \u03b1tht\n= argmax a \u2211 t \u03b1t eo(a) >ht = argmax a \u2211 t\u2208R(a,p) \u03b1t\nand hence (6) and (10) agree. Empirical evidence for (11) is given in the first two rows of table 1. The first row empirically measures the \u201cconstant\u201d c in (11) by measuring e0(a)>ht for those cases where t \u2208 R(a, p). The second row measures \u201c0\u201d in (11) by measuring eo(a)>ht in those cases where t 6\u2208 R(a, p). Additional evidence for (11) is given in figure 1 showing that the output vectors eo(a) for different entity identifiers a are nearly orthogonal. Orthogonality of the output vectors is required by (11) provided that each output vector eo(a) is in the span of the hidden state vectors ht,p for which t \u2208 R(a, p). Intuitively, the mean of all vectors ht,p with t \u2208 R(a, p) should be approximately equal to eo(a). Of course empirically this will only be approximately true. As further support for (11) we give heat maps for eo(a)ht for different identifiers a and heat maps for \u03b1t for different readers in the appendix.\nSince the model is trained under permutations of the entity identifiers, one would also expect the attention \u03b1t to be independent of the choice of the identifier permutation. In particular, for two passages with different identifier permutations resulting in hidden state vector sequences h and h\u2032 we should have q>ht = q>h\u2032t. This suggest that ht, in addition to containing a component indicating an entity identifier, also contains a component independent of the entity identifier. In addition to (11), one would expect\nq>(hi + eo(a)) = q >hi. (12)\nThis equation is equivalent to q>eo(a) = 0. Experimentally, however, we cannot expect q>eo(a) to be exactly zero and (12) seems to provides a more experimentally meaningful test. Empirical\nevidence for (12) is given in the third and fourth row of table 1. The third row measures the cosine of the angle between the question vector q and the hidden state ht averaged over passage positions t at which some entity identifier occurs. The fourth row measures the cosine of the angle between q and eo(a) averaged over the entity identifiers a.\nPredictions (11) and (12) suggest a dependent sum structure for the hidden state vector space. Let H be the vector space spanned by the hidden states ht. Our logical interpretation can be written as\nH = S \u2295 E (13) where S is a subspace of \u201cstatement vectors\u201d and E is an orthogonal subspace of \u201centity pointers\u201d. Each hidden state vector h \u2208 H then has a unique decomposition as h = \u03a8 + e for \u03a8 \u2208 S and e \u2208 E. Empirical evidence for (13) is given by the performance of models that enforce this direct sum structure as presented in section 5.\nA question asks for a value of x such that a statement \u03a6[x] is implied by the passage. Hence we should expect the question vector to represent a statement \u2014 we expect q \u2208 S. For a question \u03a6 we might even suggest the following vectorial interpretation of entailment.\n\u03a8[x] implies \u03a6[x] iff \u03a8>\u03a6 \u2265 ||\u03a6||1. This interpretation is exactly correct if some of the dimensions of the vector space correspond to predicates, \u03a6 is a 0-1 vector representing a conjunction predicates, and \u03a8 is also 0-1 on these dimensions indicating whether a predicate is implied by the context. Of course in practice one expects the dimension to be smaller than the number of possible predicates."}, {"heading": "5 POINTER ANNOTATION READERS", "text": "It is of course important to note that anonymization provides reference information \u2014 anonymization assumes that one can determine coreference so as to replace coreferent phrases with the same entity identifier. Anonymization allows the reference set R(a, p) to be directly read off of the passage. Still, an aggregation reader must learn to recover this explicit reference structure.\nAggregation readers can have difficulty when anonymization is not done. The Stanford Reader achieves just better than 45% on Who-did-What dataset while Attention Sum Reader can get near 60%. But if we anonymize the Who-did-What dataset and then re-train the Stanford Reader, the accuracy jumps to near 65%. Anonymization has two effects. First, it greatly reduces the number of output word eo(a) to be learned \u2014 we need only learn output embeddings for the relatively small number of entity identifiers needed. Second, anonymization suppresses the semantics of the reference phrases and leaves only a semantics-free entity identifier. This suppression of semantics may facilitate the separation of the hidden state vector space H into a direct sum S \u2295E with q \u2208 S and eo(a) \u2208 E.\nWe can think of anonymization as providing additional linguistic input for the reader \u2014 it explicitly marks positions of candidate answers and establishes coreference. A natural question is whether this information can be provided without anonymization by simply adding additional coreference features to the input. Here we evaluate two architectures inspired by this question. This evaluation is done on the Who-did-What dataset which is not anonymized. In each architecture we add features to the input to mark the occurrences of candidate answers. These models are simpler than the Stanford reader but perform comparably. This comparable performance in table 2 further supports our analysis of logical structure in aggregation readers.\nOne-Hot Pointer Annotation: The Stanford Reader involves both input embeddings of words and output embeddings of entity identifiers. In the Who-did-What dataset each problem has at most five choices in the multiple choice answer list. This means that we need only five entity identifiers and we can use a five dimensional one-hot vector representation for answer identifiers. If an answer choice exists at position t in the passage let it be the index of that choice on the choice list. If no choice occurs t take it to be zero. Take e\u2032(i) to be the zero vector if i = 0 and otherwise to be the one-hot vector for i. We defined pointer annotation to be the result of adding e\u2032(it) as additional features to the input embedding.\ne(wt) = [e(wt), e \u2032(it)] (14)\nWe then define a one-hot pointer reader by designates five dimensions of the hidden state as indicators of the answer and take the probability of choice i to be defined as\np(i|d, q) = softmax i oi (15)\nwhere o is computed by (4).\nGeneral Pointer Annotation: In the CNN dataset there are roughly 500 entity identifier and a onehot representation is not desirable. Instead we can let e\u2032(i) be a fixed set of \u201cpointers vectors\u201d \u2014 vectors distributed widely on the unit sphere so that for i 6= j we have that e\u2032(i)>e\u2032(j) is small. We again use (14) but replace (15) with\np(i|d, q) = softmax i\n[0, e\u2032(i)]>o (16)\nIn the general pointer reader the pointer embeddings e\u2032(i) are held fixed and not trained.\nLinguistic Features. Each model can be modified to include additional input features for each input token in the question and passage. More specifically we can add the following features to the word embeddings.\n\u2022 Binary feature: whether current token occurs in the question.\n\u2022 Real value feature: the frequency of current token in the passage. \u2022 Real value feature: position of the token\u2019s first occurrence in the passage as a percentage\nof the passage length.\n\u2022 Binary feature: whether the text surrounding token match the text surrounding the placeholder in the question. We only have features for matching both left and right one word.\n\u2022 One hot vector: Part-of-speech (POS) tagging. We didn\u2019t use such feature on CNN&DailyMail dataset.\n\u2022 One hot vector: Name Entity Recognition (NER). We didn\u2019t use such feature on CNN&DailyMail dataset."}, {"heading": "6 A SURVEY OF RECENT RESULTS", "text": "The performance of various recent readers on CNN, DailyMail and CBTest are summarized in Table 3.

Our experiments indicate that all existing readers benefit greatly from this externally provided information. Aggregation readers seem to demonstrate a stronger learning ability in that they essentially learn to mimic explicit reference readers by identifying reference annotation and using it appropriately. This is done most clearly in the pointer reader architectures. Furthermore, we have argued for, and given experimental evidence for, an interpretation of aggregation readers as learning emergent logical structure \u2014 a factoring of neural\nrepresentations into a direct sum of a statement (predicate) representation and an entity (argument) representation.\nAt a very high level our analysis and experiments support a central role for reference resolution in reading comprehension. Automating reference resolution in neural models, and demonstrating its value on appropriate datasets, would seem to be an important area for future research.\nOf course there is great interest in \u201clearning representations\u201d. The current state of the art in reading comprehension is such that systems still benefit from externally provided linguistic features including externally annotated reference resolution. It would seem desirable to develop fully automated neural readers that perform as well as readers using externally provided annotations. It is of course important to avoid straw man baselines when making any such claim.\nWe are hesitant to make any more detailed comments on the differences between the architectural details of the readers discussed in this paper. The differences in scores between the leading readers are comparable to differences in scores that can be achieved by aggressive search over meta parameters or the statistical fluctuations in the quality of models learned by noisy statistical training procedures. More careful experiments over a longer period of time are needed. More dramatic improvements in performance would of course provide better support for particular innovations."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "We thanks the support of NVIDIA Corporation with the donation of GPUs used for this work."}, {"heading": "8 APPENDIX", "text": ""}, {"heading": "8.1 EXPERIMENT DETAILS", "text": "We implemented the neural readers using Theano (de ric Bastien et al., 2012) and Blocks (van Merrienboer et al., 2015) and train them on single Nvidia Tesla K40 GPU.

We used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with the ADAM update rule (Kingma & Ba, 2015) and set the learning rate 0.0005.\nFor Stanford Reader and One-Hot Pointer Reader, we simply follows the Stanford Reader\u2019s setting and didn\u2019t tune it on each dataset. For gated attention reader, the lookup table was randomly initialized with uniform distribution from the interval [-0.2, 0.2] on CBT dataset, but on CNN&DailyMail, the lookup table was initialized by Glove vector (Jeffrey et al., 2014) trained on the train&validatation set (we found that the pre-trained word vector doesn\u2019t improve the accuracy but will accelerate the training) on CNN&DailyMail. On WDW dataset, the lookup table was initialized by pre-trained Glove vector2. It should be noticed that if we initialize the lookup table with pre-trained Glove vector from //nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip, it will slightly boost the accuracy compared with using the Glove vector trained on train&validation set.

Hidden to hidden state weights were initialized by identity matrices to force the model can remember longer information. To compute the attention weight, we \u03b1t = ht>W\u03b1q and initialize W\u03b1 with random uniform distribution. We also used the gradient clipping (Razvan et al., 2013) with threshold of 10 and batches of size 32.\nDuring training we randomly shuffled all examples within each epoch. To speedup training, we always pre-fetched 10 batches worth of examples and sorted them according to document length as did by Kadlec et al. (2016). When trained on CNN, DailyMail and WDW (anonymization case) dataset, we randomly reshuffled the entity identifier to match the procedure proposed in Hermann et al. (2015).\nDuring training we evaluated the accuracy after each epoch and stopped the training when the accuracy on the validation set started decreasing. We tried limiting the vocabulary to the most frequent tokens but didn\u2019t observed any performance improvement compared with using all the distinct tokens as vocabulary. Since part of our experiments need to check the word embedding assignment issues, finally we use all the distinct tokens as vocabulary. To find the optimal embedding and hidden state dimension, we tried several groups of different combinations, the optimal value and corresponding training statistics in Gated Attention readers are summarized in Table. 4. When anonymize the Whodid-What dataset, we can either use simple string match to replace answer in question and story with entity identifier, or we can use Name Entity Recognition(NER) tools3 to detect name entities and then replace the answer name entities in question and story with entity identifier, we found the later one generally will bring 2 % improvement compared with simple string match.

In contrast with CNN and Daily Mail, it avoids using article summaries for question formation. Instead, each problem is formed from two independent articles: one is given as the passage to be read and a different article on the same entities and events is used to form the question. Further, Who-did-What avoids anonymization, as each choice is a person named entity. In this dataset the answer set A consists of the person named entities occurring in the passage. Finally, the problems have been filtered to remove a fraction that are easily solved by simple baselines. It has two training sets. The larger training set (\u201crelaxed\u201d) is created using less baseline filtering, while the smaller training set (\u201cstrict\u201d) uses the same filtering as the validation and test sets.

The logical structure of aggregation readers reflects the architecture of \u201cexplicit reference readers\u201d such as the Attention-Sum Reader, the GatedAttention Reader and the Attention-over-Attention Reader. This relationship between aggregation readers and explicit reference readers presents a case study in emergent logical structure. In an independent contribution, we show that the addition of linguistics features to the input to existing neural readers significantly boosts performance yielding the best results to date on Who-did-What datasets1.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
