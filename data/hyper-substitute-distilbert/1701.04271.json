Introduction", "text": "Stability analysis is a central tool in statistical learning theory (Bousquet and Elisseeff (2002)). Roughly speaking, a learning algorithm is stable if a slight change in the input of the algorithm does not change its output much. It was shown (Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2010); Mukherjee et al. (2006)) that stability characterizes learnability, and in particular, stability is equivalent to the estimation error of empirical risk minimization.\nStability analysis has been mostly carried out in the context of convex risk minimization. More concretely, some form of strong convexity is often assumed (e.g., exp-concavity in Koren and Levy (2015); Gonen and Shalev-Shwartz (2016)). The crux of the technique is to show that minima of two similar strongly convex (and Lipschitz/smooth) functions must be close ((Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David, 2014, Section 13.3)).\nIn this paper we address the non-convex setting while restricting our attention to recently studied \u201cnice\u201d non-convex problems. Namely, we will consider non-convex functions which satisfy the strict saddle property (a.k.a. ridable or X -functions, see Sun et al. (2015)). Roughly speaking, a strict saddle function has no spurious local minimum and its saddle points are strict, in the sense that second-order information suffices for identifying a descent direction. We also assume that the restriction of the function to a certain neighborhood of each of its minima is strongly convex.\nMany important non-convex problems such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), complete\ndictionary recovery (Sun et al. (2015)), tensor decomposition, ICA (Ge et al. (2015), Anandkumar et al. (2016)) and matrix completion (Ge et al. (2016); Bhojanapalli et al. (2016)) are strict-saddle. Furthermore, there exist efficient empirical risk minimizers (ERM) for these problems (e.g., SGD and Cubic Regularization, see Section 9)."}, {"heading": "2.

First, we consider the case where the empirical risk is strict saddle (with high probability) and prove stability and sample complexity bounds that depend solely on the strict saddle parameters of the empirical risk and the Lipschitz constants. In particular, the bound is dimensionality independent.\nTheorem 1 Let \u01eb \u2208 (0, 1). Suppose that that the empirical risk is (\u03b1, \u03b3, \u03c4)-strict saddle with high probability (see Section 3.2). Then the sample complexity of every ERM hypothesis is at most max {\n\u03b21 \u03b3 , \u03c1 \u03c4 , 2\u03c12 \u03b1\u01eb\n}\n.\nIn some applications it may be easier to prove that F itself is strict saddle. Under the additional assumption that W is bounded, we are able to prove the next theorem.\nTheorem 2 Suppose that F (Equation (1)) is (\u03b1, \u03b3, \u03c4)-strict saddle. The sample complexity is at most O\u0303 ( d (\n\u03c1 \u03c42 + \u03b21 \u03b32 + \u03b21\u03b1\u01eb\n))\n.3\nRemark 3 The proof of this theorem actually reveals something stronger. Suppose we do not require all local minima of F to be optimally global and consider the family of empirical risk local minimizers. The same upper bound on the number of samples stated in Theorem 2 also suffices for ensuring that the value, F (w\u0302), associated with the output of any such algorithm is \u01eb-close to the value of some local minimum of F .\nWe note that our bounds scale with 1/\u01eb. In the literature, such bounds are often referred to as fast rates, because standard concentration bounds typically scale with 1/\u01eb2 (e.g., standard VCdimension bounds in the agnostic setting ((Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David, 2014, Theorem 6.8)).\n1. We always assume the existence of a minima. 2. Alternatively, given \u01eb and \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1), we ask for the minimal size of a sample S for which F (w\u0302)\u2212minw\u2208W F (w \u22c6) \u2264\n\u01eb with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4.\n3.

PCA", "text": "In Section 6 we apply Theorem 1 to a stochastic formulation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our goal is to approximately recover the leading eigenvector of the correlation matrix E[xx\u22a4], where x is drawn according to some unknown distribution D with bounded support. The standard measure of success is given by the non-convex objective min\u2016w\u2016=1\u2212w\u22a4E[xx\u22a4]w. It is known that the sample complexity of ERM for this problem is \u2126(1/\u01eb2) (Blanchard et al. (2007); Gonen et al. (2016)).\nBetter bounds can be achieved under eigengap assumptions: there exists a gap, denoted G1,2, between the two leading eigenvalues of E[xx\u22a4]. We can use the matrix Bernstein inequality to show that given an i.i.d. sample of size n = \u2126(log(d/\u03b4)/G21,2), with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, a gap of the same order also appears in the empirical correlation matrix. We then show that if such a gap exists, then the empirical risk is strict-saddle, where the parameters are inversely proportional to G1,2. This allows us to deduce a bound of order 1/(n \u00b7G1,2) on the stability and the generalization error. We summarize the above in the next theorem.\nTheorem 4 The sample complexity of PCA is O\u0303\n(\n1 G2 1,2 + 1\u01eb\u00b7G1,2\n)\n.\nThis bound is superior to the general O\u0303(1/\u01eb2) bound if \u01eb = o(G1,2). One can claim that establishing the strict-saddle parameters of the empirical risk already requires statistical tools which usually already yield generalization bounds. Indeed, in the above example, one can use the matrix Bernstein inequality to show that O\u0303(1/\u01eb22) examples suffice in order to ensure that the expected distance between the true correlation matrix and the empirical correlation matrix (in operator norm) is at most \u01eb. It is then straightforward to establish the standard 1/\u01eb2 bound on the generalization error. However, here we rely on Bernstein inequality only in order to ensure that the gap in E[xx\u22a4] appears also in the empirical correlation matrix. Consequently, we are able to prove a better bound (in a wide regime)."}, {"heading": "2.1.2.

(2015), this problem can be reduced to tensor decomposition. Moreover, the latter can be formulated as a strict saddle objective of the form (1), which can be efficiently minimized using SGD.

Strict saddle objectives resemble strongly convex functions in the following sense: it is provided that the restriction of the objective to a small neighborhood around any local minimum is\nstrongly convex. However, there are several major differences. First, as opposed to strongly convex functions, there may exists several minima. More importantly, there are regions of the domain where the function is non-convex.\nOur analysis essentially reduces to the strongly convex setting by excluding the other scenarios listed in Definition 8. Namely, we provide bounds on how many examples are needed in order to ensure that a minimizer corresponding to a slight change in the input must be in a strongly convex region around a local minimum w\u22c6. There is one more subtlety we need to tackle; we are not guaranteed that the minimizer of the (unmodified) empirical risk coincides with w\u22c6.

We assume for simplicity that Z is contained in the Euclidean unit ball. It is well known that the minimum is the leading eigenvector of the positive definite matrix E[zz\u22a4]. As we shall see, this problem becomes strict saddle once we make the following standard assumption:\n(A4) There is a positive gap, denoted G1,2, between the two leading eigenvalues of E[xx \u22a4].\nGiven a sample (z1, . . . , zn) \u223c Dn, let us denote by A = 1n \u2211n i=1 ziz \u22a4 i .

The first step should be to translate our eigengap assumption on E[zz\u22a4] to a similar assumption on A. The following lemma, which follows from a simple application of the Matrix Bernstein inequality (Tropp (2015)[Section 1.6.3]), shows that for sufficiently large n, the eigengap between the two leading eigenvalues of A is \u2126(G1,2).

Application to ICA Through Tensor Decomposition", "text": "A p-order tensor is a p-dimensional array. Here we focus on 4-order tensors. For a tensor T \u2208 R d4 and indices i1, . . . , i4 \u2208 [d], we denote the (i1, . . . , i4)-th entry of T by Ti1,...,i4 . Every ddimensional vector a induces a rank-one 4-order tensor, denoted a\u22974, where a\u22974i1,i2,i3,i4 is ai1ai2ai3ai4 . We can present the tensor T using a multilinear form.

(3)\nIn case that such decomposition exists, it is unique up to a permutation of the ai\u2019s and sign flips. A central problem in machine learning is to compute the tensor decomposition of a given tensor T (Anandkumar et al. (2014)). While we have exponentially many equivalent solutions, the average of two solutions does not form a solution. Hence, any reasonable formulation of this problem must be non-convex. Luckily, as was shown in Ge et al. (2015), there exists a strict saddle formulation of this problem.\nFor simplicity, we consider the problem of finding one component (one can proceed and find all\nthe components using deflation). Consider the following objective:\nmax \u2016u\u2016=1 T (u, u, u, u) . (4)\nLemma 22 (Ge et al. (2015)) Suppose that T admits a Tensor decomposition as in (3). The only local minima of (4) are \u00b1ai. Furthermore, the objective (4) is (\u03b1, \u03b3, \u03c4)-strict saddle with \u03b1 = \u2126(1), \u03b3 = 7/d and \u03c4 = 1/poly(d). Last, for p = 1, 2, 3, the magnitude of the p-th order derivative of this objective is O( \u221a d).\nAlthough our definition of strict saddle functions in the constrained setting is slightly different from its counterpart in Ge et al. (2015), it is not hard to show that Lemma 22 still holds (see Appendix B).\nIn applications, we often have access to T only through a stochastic oracle. Following Ge et al. (2015), we consider the following formulation of ICA. Let A be an orthonormal linear transformation. Suppose that x is uniform on {\u00b11}d and denote by y = Ax. Our goal is to recover the matrix A using the observations y. It turns out that ICA reduces to tensor decomposition. Namely, define Z \u2208 Rd4 by\n(\u2200i \u2208 [d]) Z(i, i, i, i) = 3, (\u2200i 6= j) Z(i, i, j, j) = Z(i, j, j, i) = Z(i, j, i, j) = 1 , where all other entries of Z are zero.\nLemma 23 The expectation 12E[Z \u2212 y\u22974] is equal to T , where the vectors participating in the decomposition of T correspond to columns of A.\nFollowing the lemma, we can rewrite (4) as the following expected risk:\nmax \u2016u\u2016=1 E\n[ 1\n2\n( Z \u2212 y\u22974\n) ]\n(u, u, u, u) . (5)\nFurthermore, as was shown in Ge et al. (2015), one can efficiently compute a stochastic gradient and use SGD to optimize this objective. Using Lemma 22 and Theorem 2, we conclude that the sample complexity of extracting a single column of A is O\u0303 ( poly(d) + d 3/2\n\u01eb\n)\n.

Omitted Proofs", "text": "Proof (of Lemma 19) According to the previous two lemmas, w\u0302i lies in neighborhood around a local minimum w\u22c6 such that the restriction of F\u0302 to this neighborhood is strongly convex. As in the unconstrained setting we may assume w.l.o.g. that w\u0302 = w\u22c6.\nFix some i \u2208 [n]. By assumption\nF\u0302 (w\u0302i)\u2212 F\u0302 (w\u0302) = L\u0302(w\u0302i)\u2212 L\u0302(w\u0302) \u2265 \u03b1\n2 \u2016w\u0302i \u2212 w\u0302\u20162\nOn the other hand, since w\u0302i minimizes the loss w \u2208 W 7\u2192 1n \u2211 j 6=i fj(w), the suboptimality of w\u0302i w.r.t. the objective F\u0302 is controlled by its suboptimality w.r.t. fi, i.e.\nF\u0302 (w\u0302i)\u2212 F\u0302 (w\u0302) \u2264 1\nn \u2206i\nUsing Lipschitzness of fi, we have \u2206i \u2264 \u03c1\u2016w\u0302i \u2212 w\u0302\u2016\nCombining the above, we obtain\n\u22062i \u2264 \u03c12\u2016w\u0302i \u2212 w\u0302\u20162 \u2264 2\u03c12\n\u03b1 (F\u0302 (w\u0302i)\u2212 F\u0302 (w\u0302)) \u2264\n2\u03c12 \u03b1n \u2206i\nDividing by\u2206i (we can assume w.l.o.g. that \u2206i > 0) we conclude the proof.\nProof (of Lemma 20) The first part is a direct application of Bernstein inequality (Tropp (2015)[Section 1.6.3]). It is left to prove that if A,B are positive semidefinite and \u2016A \u2212 B\u2016 \u2264 \u01eb, then for all i, |\u03bbi(A) \u2212 \u03bbi(B)| \u2264 \u01eb. Indeed,\n\u03bbi(B) = max dim(V )=i min v\u2208V\nv\u22a4Bv\nv\u22a4v\n= max dim(V )=i min v\u2208V v\u22a4Av + v\u22a4(B \u2212A)v v\u22a4v\n\u2264 max dim(V )=i min v\u2208V\nv\u22a4Av\nv\u22a4v +max v\u2208V v\u22a4(B \u2212A)v v\u22a4v\n= \u03bbi(A) + \u01eb .\nAnalogous proof shows that \u03bbi(A) \u2264 \u03bbi(B) + \u01eb.\nProof (of Theorem 2) Recall that the Lagrangian of F\u0302 is denoted by L\u0302. We first show that with high probability, points with large gradient do not form minima of F\u0302 . Similar argument shows that strict saddle points of L do not become minima of F\u0302 . Then, we can restrict ourselves to strongly convex regions of L and show that any w with F (w)\u2212minw\u2032\u2208W F (w\u2032) > \u01eb can not be a minimum of F\u0302 .\nFix some point w \u2208 W with \u2016\u2207L(w)\u2016 \u2265 \u03c4 . Using matrix Bernstein inequality, we deduce that if n = \u2126(\u03c1 log(d/\u03b4)/\u03c42)), then \u2016\u2207L\u0302(w)\u2016 \u2265 \u03c4/2. Also, using Property A2, we have that for any u \u2208 W with \u2016u \u2212 w\u2016 \u2264 r1 := min{ \u03c44\u03b21 , 1}, \u2016\u2207L\u0302(u)\u2016 \u2265 \u03c4/4. Since W is bounded we can cover W using (4B/r1)d balls of radius r1 (for example, see the proof of Matous\u030cek (2002)[Lemma 13.11.1]). By applying the union bound we deduce that if n = \u2126(d\u03c1 log(dB/(r1\u03b4)/\u03c4\n2), then with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4, all points w with \u2016\u2207L(w)\u2016 \u2265 \u03c4 satisfy \u2016\u2207L\u0302(w)\u2016 \u2265 \u03c4/4.\nWe next fix some pointw \u2208 W for which there exists a unit vector v \u2208 T (w)with v\u22a4(\u22072L(w))v \u2264 \u2212\u03b3. Using matrix Bernstein inequality, we deduce that if n = \u2126(\u03b21 log(d/\u03b4)/\u03b32), then v\u22a4\u22072L(w)v \u2264 \u2212\u03b3/2. Also, using Property A3, we have that for any u \u2208 W with \u2016u\u2212 w\u2016 \u2264 r2 := min{ \u03b34\u03b22 , 1}, there exists v \u2208 T (u)with v\u22a4\u22072L(u)v. SinceW is bounded, we can coverW using (4B/r2)d balls of radius r2. By applying the union bound, we obtain that a sample of size n = \u2126(d\u03b21 log(dB/(r2\u03b4))/\u03b3\n2) ensures that with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4, \u03b3-strict saddle points of F are \u03b3/2-strict saddle of F\u0302 .\nIn particular, using Theorem 14 and Theorem 15 we deduce that strict saddle points of F and points with large gradient do not form local minima of L\u0302.\nConsider now vectors w \u2208 W which belong to a strongly convex region around some minimum of F , denoted w\u22c6. Suppose that F (w) \u2212 F (w\u22c6) > \u01eb. By strong convexity, \u2016\u2207L(w)\u20162 \u2265 2\u03b1\u01eb.\nUsing concentration and covering as above, we conclude that for n = \u2126(\u03b21 log(dB/(r1\u03b4))/(\u03b1\u01eb)), then with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4, \u2016\u2207L\u0302(w)\u20162 \u2265 \u03b1\u01eb, hence w is not a local minimum of F\u0302 ."}], "references": [{"title": "Finding local minima for nonconvex optimization in linear time", "author": ["Naman Agarwal", "Zeyuan Allen-Zhu", "Brian Bullins", "Elad Hazan", "Tengyu Ma"], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.01146,", "citeRegEx": "Agarwal et al\\.,?
