INTRODUCTION", "text": "This document is description of the Korea University \u2013\nIntelligent Signal Processing Laboratory (KU-ISPL) speaker recognition system for NIST 2016 speaker recognition evaluation (SRE16).\nUnder i-vector framework, new approaches are introduced using Bottleneck Feature (BNF) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) which were validated successfully its performance improvement on ASR. In this study, we developed the state-of-the-art i-vector systems for validating the performances on language mismatch condition using SRE16 dataset. Based on the prior studies about domain adaptation and compensation, Inter Dataset Variability Compensation (IDVC) and unsupervised domain adaptation using interpolated PLDA are also applied.\nAfter studying about prior works, we proposed additional techniques for compensating the language mismatch condition to obtain robust performance on SRE 16 dataset. For official evaluation, we submitted total 3 systems including 1 primary system and 2 contrastive systems in fixed training data condition. We carefully followed the\nSRE16 rules and requirements during training and test processes.\nIn the following, we introduce a dataset of SRE 16 at section 2.

It is consist of 20 cepstral coefficients including log-energy C0, then, it is appended with its delta and acceleration. For training DNN based acoustic model that is inspired by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) area, different configuration was adopt to generate 40 ceptral coefficient without energy component for high resolution of acoustic features (ASR-MFCC). For feature normalization, Cepstral Mean Normalization is applied with 3 seconds-length sliding window.\nAfter extracting acoustic features, Voice Activity algorithm was adopted to remove silence and low energy segments on the speech dataset. Simple energy based VAD was used with log-mean scaled threshold. Using log-energy (C0) component of MFCC, the mean log-energy of each segment can be calculated and it is scale to half value and then plus by 6. That is the final scaled threshold for VAD. We do not apply VAD algorithm when we training DNN acoustic model."}, {"heading": "3.2.

Whitening Transform and Length Normalization using unlabeled dataset (WTLN)[5]\nWhitening transformation and length normalization are simple and powerful techniques to improve performance of speaker recognition system by compensating the mismatch between enrollment and test i-vector length. It became a mandatory process of i-vector based speaker recognition system back-end and, moreover, recent study validated its effectiveness on domain adaptation by calculating whitening transform matrix using the in-domain dataset.

Using the clustered speaker information, in-domain Within-speaker Covariance (WC) and Across-speaker Covariance (AC) of PLDA model are interpolated from out-of-domain WC and AC. We applied this approach on the unlabeled dataset of minor and major language. By experiments, 30 and 450 clusters were used for speaker clustering of unlabeled minor and major dataset. The 450 clusters (speaker) information of unlabeled major dataset could be used for calibration as Sec.4.5.\n3.3.4. S-norm [7]\nSymmetric normalization(S-norm) is adopted for score normalization.

Gender i-vector obtained by averaging the i-vectors of training set by gender.\nLanguage classification can be done by unsupervised clustering algorithm such as AHC or k-means clustering. Since k-means clustering performance is greatly depend on initial point as figure 1, AHC is frequently used on i-vector feature space.\nFor high accuracy and reliability of clustering algorithm, we proposed 2-step approach by running k-means algorithm twice on different i-vector representation space. If the kmeans algorithm secure good initial clusters that represent the mean of i-vectors from each language, we can get a high language classification performance while reducing the risk of misclassification by random initial cluster.\nWe check this on the minor enrollment and test dataset in development set which have language labels, so that they allowed us to investigate the performance of language classification. We use 2-step approach for language clustering as below schemes.\n1. Initializing on IDVC subspace (alike PCA) 2. K-means\nOr\n1. Initialing using AHC 2. K-means\nBoth approaches shows same result on minor enrollment and test dataset and it showed 100% language clustering accuracy on minor enrollment dataset and 99.8% on minor test dataset.

For calibration, speaker clustering information of unlabeled major dataset was used (see Sec. 3.3.3) to obtain target and non-target score distribution of evaluation experiments. The mean of speaker cluster represent speaker i-vector and they can be scored with unlabeled major i-vectors. As we have already speaker label from speaker clustering, we can obtain target score and non-target score distribution and they could be used for score calibration on evaluation trials.

SUBSYSTEMS FOR MINOR LANUGUAGES", "text": "By applying the components described in section 3 and 4, we evaluate the development trials in terms of EER, minimum Cprimary, and actual Cprimary.

SUBSYSTEMS AND ITS FUSION FOR MAJOR LANGUAGE", "text": "We try to use development dataset as much as possible because the development set is mirror the evaluation, so it would contain more valuable information than training dataset which language is English.\nEach subsystems has been applied most competitive techniques from the studies in previous sections for best result. Contrary to estimating the gender and language labels of unlabeled dataset for ILVC at Sec.5 and table 2, we use enrollment and test dataset of minor language and its labels\nfor ILVC. According this method, the performance of subsystems improved dramatically as table 3. Main reason is that we did not process each trials independently and use development enrollment and test dataset information on development trials. We expect that the performance of evaluation trials would not be improved dramatically like development trials, however, still convince that it would influence beneficial effects on systems for major languages. Submitted system has little difference on score normalization and usage of minor language labels.\nThe primary system is fusion of 5 subsystems of top 5 rows in table 3. We used entire minor dataset (enrollment, test and unlabeled) and unlabeled major dataset for GLnorm on both development and evaluation experiments.\nFor Contrastive 1 system, only unlabeled major dataset is used for GL-norm on both development and evaluation\nexperiment. Ground truth label was not used for ILVC, so the result is same with the last row table. 2 at GL-norm tab.\nContrastive 2 system is same with primary system. The difference is that only unlabeled major dataset is used for GL-norm on both development and evaluation experiment."}, {"heading": "7.
