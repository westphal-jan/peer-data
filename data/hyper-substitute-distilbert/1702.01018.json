Two such infrastructures that engage in a heavy symbiotic dependency are the power and communication networks. For example, consider entities in the power network such as SCADA systems. The primary function of a SCADA system is to control power generation units remotely. This operation relies on the entities of the communication network for receiving control commands. On the other hand communication network\nentities are dependent on electric power to function properly. The power and communication networks are highly vulnerable to nature induced and man made (terrorist attack) failure. Considering a set of entities in either network failing initially, further failures may be triggered due to the interdependencies between them.\nFor analysis of these infrastructures it is imperative to model their interdependencies. A number of such models have been proposed [4], [7], [14], [12], [15], [11], [10], [3]. However, most of these models fail to account for the complex interdependencies between the networks [1]. In [13] the authors described the need to address complex interdependencies as the one in the following example. Consider an entity ai in power network and entities bj , bk, bl, bm, bn in the communication network. For the entity ai to be operational (i) entities bj and bk needs to be operational, or (ii) entities bk and bm needs to be operational, or (iii) entity bn needs to be operational. The constructed interdependency cannot be represented by graph based interdependency models as described in [14], [12], [15], [5], [11], [10], [4], [7]. Graph based models fall short in capturing the disjunctive and conjunctive dependencies that exists in real world systems. Authors in [13] proposed an Implicative Interdependency Model that overcome these limitations. The model uses Boolean Logic to characterize the complex interdependencies. This model was used to study a number of problems on interdependent critical systems [13], [6], [9] and [2].\nWe use the Implicative Interdependency Model (IIM) to study the \u201cRobustness\u201d problem in interdependent power and communication network. An Interdependent Network (IDN) is formally denoted as I(A,B,F(A,B)). Here A and B are set of entities in power and communication network respectively and function F(A,B) capturing the interdependency between them through the IIM model (discussed later). \u201cRobustness\u201d of an interdependent system can be formulated with respect to two parameters K \u2208 I+\u222a{0} and \u03c1 \u2208 R with 0 < \u03c1 \u2264 1. An interdependent system is (K, \u03c1)-robust if a minimum of K + 1 entities need to fail for failure of at least \u03c1(|A| + |B|) entities. This robustness value can be treated as a metric to determine the quality of an IDN when it is set up initially. In existing systems this value determines the need and importance of introducing additional measures for improving their robustness.\nThe interdependencies using the IIM model can be categorized into four cases (namely case I, II, III and IV). The robustness problem is separately studied for each individual cases. We show that for case I there exists a polynomial time solution to the problem whereas all the other cases are NP-complete. Additionally, we provide an in-approximability bound for case III, an optimal solution using integer linear program for case IV (the general case) and a heuristic for the same. The heuristic is compared with the optimal solution using power and communication network data of Maricopa County, Arizona. From the experimental results we infer that almost always our heuristic produces near optimal solution for \u03c1 < 0.42.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the IIM model is presented, formal definition of the robustness problem and analysis of its com-\nputational complexity are done in Section 3 and 4 respectively, the heuristic and optimal solution to the problem is provided in Section 5 with the corresponding experimental results in Section 6, and we conclude the paper is Section 7."}, {"heading": "2 The Implicative Interdependency Model", "text": "In this section we describe the IIM model [13]. Consider an IDN I(A,B,F(A,B)). The set A and B consisits of entities {a1, a2, a3} and {b1, b2, b3, b4} respectively. The function F(A,B) giving the set of dependency equations are represented in Table 1. We call the dependency equation of each entity as Implicative Dependency Relation (IDR). In the given example, an IDR a1 \u2190 b3+ b1b4 implies that entity a1 is operational if entity b3 or entity b1 and b4 are operational. In the IDR each conjunction term e.g. a2a3 is referred to as minterms.\nInitial failure of an entity set in A \u222a B would cause the failure to cascade until a steady state is reached. The event of an entity failing after the initial failure is termed as induced failure. The cascade is assumed to occur in time steps of unit length. Each time step captures the effect of entities killed in all previous time steps. We demonstrate the cascading failure for the interdependent network outlined in Table 1 through an example. Consider that the entity a1 fails at time step t = 0. Table 2 represents the cascade of failure in each subsequent time steps. In Table 2, for a given entity and time step \u20320\u2032 represents the entity is operational and \u20321\u2032 non operational. In this example a steady state is reached at time step t = 4 when all entities are non operational. The IIM model also assumes that the dependent entities of all failed entities are killed immediately at the next time step. For example at time step t = 1 entities a1, b2 and b4 are non operational. Due to the IDR a1 \u2190 b2 + b4 entity a1 is killed immediately at time step t = 2.\nThe main challenge of the IIM model is accurate formulation of the IDRs. Two possible ways of doing this would be 1) careful analysis of the underlying infrastructures as in [3], 2) Consultation with domain experts. However we only utilize the IIM model to analyze the Robustness problem and refrain from addressing the mentioned challenge."}, {"heading": "3 Problem Formulation", "text": "As described before we define the Robustness in Interdependent Network (RIDN) problem with respect to an integer K \u2208 I+ \u222a {0} and a real valued parameter \u03c1 \u2208 R with 0 < \u03c1 \u2264 1. An IDN I(A,B,F(A,B)) is (K, \u03c1) robust if a minimum of K + 1 entities need to fail initially for a final failure of at least \u03c1(|A| + |B|) entities. For example, the IDN described in Table 1 is (0,\u03c1) robust for any value of \u03c1 \u2208 (0, 1]. This is because initial failure of entity a2 causes all the entities to fail in the steady state. The output of the RIDN problem is the parameter K for a given IDN and a value of \u03c1.

We provide a polynomial time algorithm (Algorithm 1) and prove its optimality ( Theorem 1) that solves the RIDN problem for Case I.\nTo develop the algorithm we use the notion of Kill Set of an entity xi \u2208 A\u222aB as in [13].

Algorithm 1 solves the RIDN problem for Case I optimally in polynomial time.\nProof. Computation of Kill Sets for all A \u222aB entities can be done in O((|A| + |B|)3) [13]. The while loop runs for maximum of |A| + |B| times when \u03c1 = 1 and Kill Set of each entity is only composed of the entity itself. The highest cardinality Kill Set among all Kill Sets can be found in O(|A|+|B|). The for loop iterates for |A|+|B| times with computation inside it taking O(|A|+|B|) time per iteration. Hence, the time complexity of the while loop in total is O((|A|+ |B|)3). So the overall time complexity of Algorithm 1 is O((|A| + |B|)3).\nWe claim that Algorithm 1 returns the optimal value of robustness parameter K = |E| \u2212 1 of an IDN I(A,B,F(A,B)) with set E containing the minimum number of entities that causes failure of at least \u03c1(|A|+ |B|) entities. The claim is proved by contradiction. Let EOPT be the optimal set that causes failure of at least \u03c1(|A|+ |B|) entities and xn be an entity in EOPT \\E.

At any iteration of the while loop the entity xj with highest cardinality Kill Set is selected. Inside the for loop all entities having Cxi \u2229Cxj = Cxi and the entity itself would have its Kill Set updated to \u2205. Hence the Kill Set of the entity xn would either be set to \u2205 at some iteration of the while loop or didn\u2019t have the highest cardinality at any iteration. Hence adding xn to optimal solution would have made no difference or reduce the number of failed entities. Hence a contradiction. So Algorithm 1 returns the optimal number of entities that causes failure of at least \u03c1(|A|+ |B|) entities."}, {"heading": "4.2 Case II: Problem Instance with One Minterm of Arbitrary Size", "text": "Case II is composed of IDRs having a single minterm of arbitrary size. A minterm of size p with entities xi and yj belonging to networkA(B) and B(A) respectively can be represented as xi \u2190 \u220fp j=1 yj. Thus killing any one entity (or more) from the product term would kill xi. In Theorem 2 we prove that the decision version of the RIDN problem for Case II is NP complete.\nTheorem 2. The decision version of the RIDN problem for Case II is NPcomplete.\nProof. We prove the NP-completeness by giving a transformation from the Hitting Set Problem. An instance of the hitting set problem consists of a set of elements S and a set S = {S1, S2, S3, .., Sn} where Si \u2286 S, \u2200Si \u2208 S. The question asked in the problem is given an integer M does there exist a set S\u2032 \u2286 S with |S\u2032| \u2264 M such that each subset in S contains at least one element from S\u2032. From an instance of the hitting set problem we create an instance of the RIDN problem as follows. For each element xi \u2208 S we add an entity bi \u2208 B. Similarly for each subset Si \u2208 S we add an entity ai \u2208 A. For each subset Si = {xm, xn, xp} (say) we create an IDR ai \u2190 bmbnbp. The value of K is set to M and \u03c1 is set to M+|S||S|+|S| . It is to be noted that there wont be any cascading failure due to absence of dependency relations of B type entities. Let there exists a solution to the hitting set problem. So each subset Si \u2208 S has at least one element from set S\u2032 (with |S\u2032| = M). Hence killing the corresponding B type entities from the constructed instance would kill all A type entities. Thus the fraction of entities killed is M+|S||S|+|S| = \u03c1 solving the RIDN problem. On the other way round let there exist a solution to the RIDN problem. It can be shown that the initial failure set would always be chosen from set B to fail \u03c1 = M+|S||S|+|S| fraction of entities. This is because failure of any A type entity cannot trigger failure of any other entity. Moreover the total number of entities in final failure set is M + |S| (as |S| = |A|). Thus the failure set must contain all A type entities except for M other entities which has to be chosen from set B. So a solution to RIDN problem consisting of entities B\u2032 \u2286 B would ensure that for each entity ai \u2208 A at least one entity in its IDR is killed initially. So the set of elements in S\u2032 corresponding to the entities in B\u2032 would solve the hitting set problem. Hence proved"}, {"heading": "4.3 Case III: Problem Instance with an Arbitrary Number of Minterm of Size One", "text": "Case III is composed of IDRs having arbitrary number of minterms of size 1. With entities xi and yq belonging to network A(B) and B(A) respectively this case can be represented as xi \u2190 \u2211p q=1 yq. The given example has p minterms each of size 1. Thus to kill xi all entities in its IDR must be killed. In Theorem 3 we prove that the decision version of the RIDN problem for Case III is NP complete.\nTheorem 3. The decision version of the RIDN problem for Case III is NPcomplete.\nProof. We prove that the problem is NP-complete by giving a reduction from the Densest p-Subhypergraph problem [8], a known NP- complete problem. An instance of the Densest p-Subhypergraph problem includes a hypergraph G = (V,E), a parameter p and a parameter M . The problem asks the question whether there exists a set of vertices |V \u2032| \u2286 V and |V \u2032| \u2264 p such that the subgraph induced with this set of vertices has at least M completely covered hyperedges. From an instance of the Densest p-Subhypergraph problem we create an instance of the RIDN problem as follows. For each vertex vi \u2208 V we add an entity bi \u2208 B. Similarly for each hyperedge ej \u2208 E we add an entity aj \u2208 A. For each hyperedge ej with ej = {vm, vn, vq} (say) an IDR of form aj \u2190 bm+bn+bq is created. The value of K is set to p and \u03c1 is set to p+M|V |+|E| . It is to be noted that there wont be any cascading failure due to absence of dependency relations of B type entities.\nLet there exist a solution to the Densest p-Subhypergraph problem. Then there exist a set V \u2032 \u2286 V and |V \u2032| = p that covers completely at leastM hypedges in E. Thus killing the B type entities corresponding to the vertices in V \u2032 would cause at least M A type entities to fail. Hence the fraction of entities killed is \u2265 p+M|V |+|E| = \u03c1. So the solution of the Densest p-Subhypergraph problem solves the Robustness problem. For the created instance of the RIDN problem all entities in set B can only fail initially. The A type entities can either fail initially or through induced failure of failing B type entities. Hence initial failure of entities from set B would have the most impact on final number of entities failed. Let us assume that there exists one or many solutions to the RIDN problem. Then at least one solution would have entities only from set B. For this solution the number of entities killed on initial failure of p B type entities is at least p+M . The additional M entities killed belongs to set A. So the vertices in V corresponding to the entities in B would completely cover at least M hyperedges. Thus the solution of RIDN problem solves the Densest p-Subhypergraph problem. Hence proved.\nTheorem 4. The RIDN problem for Case III is hard to approximate within a factor 1\n2log(n)\u03bb (where n = |A \u222aB|) for some \u03bb > 0.\nProof. In [8] it is proved the Densest p-Subhypergraph problem is hard to approximate within a factor of 1\n2log(n)\u03bb with \u03bb > 0. For IDRs of form Case III it is\nshown in Theorem 3 that Densest p-Subhypergraph problem is a special case of the RIDN problem.

Let K \u2032 be the solution to the ILP. Then the IDN is (K, \u03c1) robust with K = K \u2032 \u2212 1. The ILP works with two variables xid and yid for each entity xi \u2208 A and yi \u2208 B respectively. The parameter d in the variable denotes the time step. xid =1 (or yid = 1) if at time step d the entity xi (yi) is in a failed state and 0 otherwise. With these definitions the objective function can be formulated as follows:\nmin\nm\u2211\ni=1\nxi0 +\nn\u2211\nj=1\nyj0 (1)\nIn the above objective function m and n denote the size of the networks A and B respectively. The constraints of the ILP are formally described as follows:\nConstraint Set 1: xid \u2265 xi(d\u22121), \u2200d, 1 \u2264 d \u2264 tf and yid \u2265 yi(d\u22121), \u2200d, 1 \u2264 d \u2264 tf , where tf denotes the final time step. The constraint satisfies the property that if the entity xi fails at time step d it should remain to be in the failed state for all subsequent time steps [13].\nConstraint Set 2: A brief overview of the constraint set to model the failure propagation through cascades is presented here. Consider an IDR of form ai \u2190 bj + bkbl + bmbnbq. This corresponds to the general case or Case IV as discussed earlier. The constraints created to capture the failure propagation are described in the following steps \u2014\nStep 1: We introduce new variables to represent minterms of size greater than one. In this example two new variables c1 and c2 are introduced to represent the minterms bkbl and bmbnbq respectively. This is equivalent of adding two new IDRs c1 \u2190 bkbl and c2 \u2190 bmbnbq along with the transformed IDR ai \u2190 bj + c1 + c2.\nStep 2: For each IDR corresponding to the c type variables and untransformed IDRs of form Case II we introduce a linear constraint to capture the failure propagation. For an IDR c2 \u2190 bmbnbq the constraint is represented as c2d \u2264 ym(d\u22121) + yn(d\u22121) + yq(d\u22121), \u2200d, 1 \u2264 d \u2264 tf .\nStep 3: Similarly, for each transformed IDR and untransformed IDRs of form Case III we introduce a linear constraint to capture the failure propagation. For an IDR ai \u2190 bj + c1 + c2 the constraint is represented as N \u00d7 xid \u2264 yj(d\u22121) + c1(d\u22121) + c2(d\u22121), \u2200d, 1 \u2264 d \u2264 tf . Here N is the number of minterms in the IDR (in this example N = 3).\nConstraint Set 3: We must also ensure that at time step tf at least \u03c1(|A|+ |B|) entities fail. This can be captured by introducing the constraint m\u2211 i=1 xi(tf ) + n\u2211 j=1 yj(tf ) \u2265 \u03c1(|A|+ |B|).\nSo with the objective in (1) and set of constraints the ILP finds the minimum number of entities K \u2032 which when failed initially causes at least \u03c1(|A| + |B|) entities to fail at tf ."}, {"heading": "5.2 Heuristic Solution for the RIDN problem", "text": "A heuristic solution for the RIDN problem is provided in this subsection. Along with the definition of Kill Set, we introduce the notion of Total Minterm Hit Set of an entity to design the heuristic. Before formal definition of Total Minterm Hit Set we first define Minterm Hit Set of an entity as follows \u2014\nDefinition 1. The Minterm Hit Set for an entity xj \u2208 A\u222aB in an interdependent network I(A,B,F(A,B)) is denoted as MHS(xj). MHS(xj) contains the set of all minterms that has the entity xj in it.\nDefinition 2. The Total Minterm Hit Set for an entity xj \u2208 A \u222a B is denoted as TMHS(xj). It is defined as union of Minterm Hit Set of all entities in Cxj (Kill Set of xj).\nUsing these definitions a heuristic is formulated in Algorithm 2. For each iteration of the while loop in the algorithm, the operational entity having highest cardinality Kill Set is selected. This ensures that at each step the number of entities failed is maximized. In case of a tie, the entity having highest cardinality Total Minterm Hit Set among the set of tied entities is selected. This causes the selection of the entity that has the potential to kill maximum number of entities in the subsequent steps. Thus, the heuristic greedily minimizes the set of entities which when killed initially fails at least \u03c1 fraction of total entities in the IDN. The heuristic overestimates the parameter K while determining the robustness (K, \u03c1) of an IDN. The value of the parameter K is equal to |KH |\u22121 which is the output of Algorithm 2.

It can be seen from the figures that the heuristic solution performs almost same as the ILP till \u03c1 = 0.42. For values of \u03c1 higher than 0.42 there results in an overestimation of the robustness parameter K. The maximum overestimation is 3 for Region 1, 4 for Region 2 and 3 and 5 for Region 4."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we propose the Robustness problem in Multilayer Interdependent Network. Robustness in an IDN is defined with respect to two parameters K and \u03c1. The Implicative Interdependency Model is utilized to model the interdependency. The IIM model segregates the interdependency relations into four\ndifferent cases. Analysis of computational complexity of the Robustness problem is done with respect to these four cases. For the general form of interdependency relation, the problem is found to be NP-complete. The optimal solution for the general case is obtained from an ILP. A heuristic is designed that returns an overestimated K parameter value for a given \u03c1. Finally we compare the efficacy of the heuristic with the optimal solution using real data set of Maricopa County, Arizona. The heuristic produced optimal or near optimal solution for \u03c1 < 0.42."}], "references": [{"title": "A survey of interdependency models for critical infrastructure networks", "author": ["J.

functionality. Many significant research have been pursued to model the interdependency and failure analysis of these interdependent networks. However most of these models fail to capture the complex interdependencies that might actually exist between the infrastructures. The Implicative Interdependency Model that utilizes Boolean Logic to capture complex interdependencies was recently proposed which overcome the limitations of the existing models. A number of problems were studies based on this model. In this paper we study the Robustness problem in Interdependent Power and Communication Network. The robustness is defined with respect to two parameters K \u2208 I \u222a {0} and \u03c1 \u2208 (0, 1]. We utilized the Implicative Interdependency Model model to capture the complex interdependency between the two networks. The model classifies the interdependency relations into four cases. Computational complexity of the problem is analyzed for each of these cases. A polynomial time algorithm is designed for the first case that outputs the optimal solution. All the other cases are proved to be NP-complete. An in-approximability bound is provided for the third case. For the general case we formulate an Integer Linear Program to get the optimal solution and a polynomial time heuristic. The applicability of the heuristic is evaluated using power and communication network data of Maricopa County, Arizona. The experimental results showed that the heuristic almost always produced near optimal value of parameter K for \u03c1 < 0.42.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
