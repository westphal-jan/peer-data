INTRODUCTION"}, {"heading": "A. Motivation", "text": "LANE departure is an unintentional drifting towards theboundary of the driving lane, which usually occurs when the driver is drowsy or fatigued [1]. In the United States, 37.4% of fatal crashes are due to single-vehicle lane departure [2], which makes it the leading cause of fatalities [3]. Lanedeparture warning (LDW) systems aim to alert the driver when the lane departure begins and has great potential for vehicle safety [4]. LDW systems can detect or predict lane-departure events and give a warning in an auditory, haptic, or visual form [5]\u2013[12]. The challenge to designing a successful LDW\nThe first two authors, W.

A high-rate of false alarms may reduce the driver\u2019s trust in the LDW system or cause the driver to become annoyed. As shown in Fig. 1, the LDW system needs to accurately predict the driver\u2019s intention and provides warnings only when needed. A successful LDW design needs to understand driving style of a specific person and offer a personalized assistance."}, {"heading": "B. Related Research", "text": "Most LDW systems use time to lane crossing (TLC) to determine whether to activate the warning. TLC is defined as the time duration available for the driver before lane-boundary crossing. However, the TLC-based method has been criticized for having a high FAR [8], [13] because of its inability to predict driver\u2019s intention. The TLC-based warning could be triggered when the TLC reaches the predefined critical value (usually more than 0.9 s). Yet drivers can usually keep the vehicle close to the lane boundary and then bring the vehicle back to the center of the lane without the warning in the second step, as the solid blue line shows in Fig. 1, which illustrates driver correction behavior (DCB). A warning given when the driver can presumably keep the vehicle in the lane is likely to cause annoyance. Therefore, it is crucial to infer the driver\u2019s upcoming behavior and judge whether the driver could bring the vehicle back to the lane center and then decide when the warning should be given to the driver, thus reducing the annoyance level of excessive false warning and avoiding crashes. ar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n01 22\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 4\nF eb\n2 01\n7\n2 Several approaches have been proposed to reduce the FAR. Angkitrakul et al. [8] proposed a stochastic driver model to predict the vehicle trajectory. Experimental results showed that the approach had a 17% FAR in detecting an intentional correction in the subsequent 0.5 s. When the prediction time was lengthened to 1.5 s, the FAR exceeded 100%. Another indicator of whether a warning will be given to the driver is based on whether the driver will bring the car back to the lane center after the vehicle approaches the boundary. If the driver\nplans to bring the vehicle back with some minor departure (i.e., the solid blue line in Fig. 1), it is not necessary to send a warning to the driver; if the driver is not aware of the situation and the departure may exceed a certain threshold (i.e., the dashed blue line in Fig. 1), a warning should be sent to the driver to avoid a crash. Saito et al. [10] applied the idea in Fig. 1 with a dual control scheme in driver drowsiness. In their study [10], the steering angle was used to estimate the driver\u2019s state and then decide whether an assist control should be implemented. Though this approach can improve safety by identifying driver drowsiness, it can not predict the future trajectory of the vehicle and the driver\u2019s future operations."}, {"heading": "C. Contributions", "text": "We propose an online model-based prediction algorithm of vehicle lateral trajectory to prevent false warnings by inferring whether the driver\u2019s forthcoming behavior can bring the vehicle back to the driving lane or cross the lane boundary and potentially cause a crash. The goal is to employ the personalized driver model (PDM) to infer the upcoming lateral trajectory of a vehicle by using a model-based prediction algorithm. We apply a PDM in our research because the driving styles of lane departure and lane keeping behaviors for drivers differ greatly, and the PDM can discern the characteristics of individual\u2019s driving style. The proposed PDM describes the driver\u2019s lanekeeping behavior and lane-departure behavior by using a jointprobability density distribution of Gaussian mixture model (GMM) between vehicle speed, relative yaw angle, relative yaw rate, lateral displacement, and road curvature. Then, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to estimate the vehicle\u2019s lateral displacement based on the trained GMM. An online model-based prediction algorithm is developed to predict the vehicle\u2019s lateral displacement. We can then predict the future trajectory of the vehicle and judge whether the driver will approach the lane boundary and then bring the vehicle back, keeping the vehicle in the driving lane.

LANE DEPARTURE PREDICTION", "text": "Lane departure prediction (LDP) aims to estimate whether a vehicle will depart from the lane, thus allowing a longer time for a driver to take effective action to avoid a crash. The LDP algorithms in the literature can be roughly classified into three groups: TLC-based prediction [8], [14], [15], vehicle-variablebased vehicle-position estimation [9], [16]\u2013[18], and detection of the lane boundary using real-time road images [19]\u2013[21]. Some of the methods in the first and second categories share a common feature, namely, they all use real-time images. The vision- or vehicle-variable-based method can improve TLCbased prediction, but have a hard time predicting DCB, these methods are difficult to deal with it. In this paper, we focus on predicting vehicle trajectory and deciding whether to send a warning, that is , developing a more effective warning system, instead of lane-detection techniques."}, {"heading": "A. Time to Lane Crossing (TLC)", "text": "The TLC-based algorithm has been widely reported in the literature and used on production vehicles. These systems estimate the lane states [9], [17] (i.e., lane markers, lane width, and lane curvature, etc.) and vehicle states based on visionbased equipment, and then calculate the TLC online using a variety of algorithms [14]. When the TLC reaches a threshold, the LDW sends alerts the driver. The computation methods of TLC differ with regard to various road geometries and vehicle types. The most common method for calculating the TLC is to predict the road boundary and the vehicle trajectory and then calculate the time when they intersect. When road curvature is small, the TLC can be computed as the ratio of lateral distance to lateral velocity or the ratio of the distance to the line crossing [14]:\ntTLC = \u2206y \u2212 (D/2\u2212 lf \u00b7 tan\u03c8)\nv sin\u03c8 (1)\nwhere \u2206y is the lateral distance from the vehicle\u2019s center of gravity (CoG) to the line that would be crossed, \u03c8 is the relative yaw angle between the longitudinal coordinate of the vehicle and the road direction as shown in Fig. 2, v is the vehicle speed, D is the width of vehicle, and lf is the distance between the front axle and the CoG of the vehicle."}, {"heading": "B.

The red circle represents the TLC-based warning methods.\nto the lane boundary [8], [13], [14]. This is primarily due to using an oversimplified model to reduce computational complexity, viz. neglecting drivers\u2019 steering characteristics and vehicle dynamics. Another reason for the high FAR is that some drivers will control the vehicle back to the center of the lane without the help of a warning with DCB. The problem, however, is that most LDW systems can not predict the forthcoming driver behaviors or vehicle trajectories. Fig. 3 shows two cases consisting of unintentional LDB and intentional DCB. In the case shown in Fig. 3(b), an LDW is not desired because the driver can guide the vehicle back after being close to the lane boundary. This kind of false warning is difficult to reduce by improving the accuracy of sensor data (e.g., road curvature) or a TLC-based calculation method (e.g., considering the attributes of vehicle dynamics). Therefore, to reduce this kind of false warning, we need to estimate the driver\u2019s forthcoming behavior by asking, \u201cWill the driver bring the vehicle back to the center of the driving lane within a short span of time?\u201d or \u201cDoes the driver correctly understand the driving situation?\u201d."}, {"heading": "III. PROPOSED METHOD", "text": "HMM has been widely used to model driver dynamic behaviors due to its powerful ability to describe the dynamic process and infer unobserved (hidden) states [22]. In the HMM, we apply the component of GMM to representing the hidden modes (Fig. 4), which makes it easier to determine the Markov chain modes. We use the GMM to model the dependent relationship between variables that could describe driver behaviors because the GMM method has been applied to model driving tasks and has shown its effectiveness [8], [23], thus more off-the-shelf techniques for estimating the model parameters can be directly used. Based on the GMM, we use the observations to infer the hidden states and design a modelbased prediction algorithm to infer driver upcoming behaviors."}, {"heading": "A.

We describe drivers\u2019 lane-keeping or lane-departure behaviors using the following variables: \u2022 Vehicle Speed (v): Speed selections have a great influence\non drivers\u2019 lateral control [25] and drivers\u2019 risk perception [26]. Drivers will usually compensate for steering errors by adjusting the vehicle speed [27], keeping the TLC constant. Also, according to Mammar [14], the speed is one key to influencing the TLC. With the same relative yaw angle of \u03c8 6= 0, higher speed leads to a smaller TLC. \u2022 Relative Yaw Angle (\u03c8): According to May and Baldwin [1], the TLC is also influenced by the relative yaw angle (Fig. 2). For example, a larger relative yaw angle generates a shorter TLC and has a greater potential for crashes. Therefore, the relative yaw angle is selected as one variable for modeling driver behaviors. \u2022 Relative Yaw Rate (\u03c8\u0307): The relative yaw rate can indirectly show a driver\u2019s intentions. For example, when the vehicle is approaching the road boundary, an inverse relative yaw rate can slow down the approaching speed towards the road boundary and avoid a crash. \u2022 Road Curvature (\u03c1): Estimation of road profiles is a big challenge for calculating TLC due to the difficulty of accurately estimating road geometry. In general, to simplify the model and reduce computation cost, road curvature is assumed to be constant or affine varying [14] over a short span of time. The means of computing TLC differ with respect to a straight road and a curved road. In this paper, we mainly consider the scenarios where the road has a small curvature \u03c1 \u2264 10\u22124 m\u22121. \u2022 Lateral Displacement (\u2206y): Drivers differ in terms of their preferences for maintaining a vehicle\u2019s lateral position with respect to the road boundary, related to many factors such as the driver\u2019s ability to perceive risk [26]\n4 and driver states [28]. Drivers can laterally displace the vehicle according to their own physical and psychological states. Therefore, lateral displacement is also selected to describe driver behaviors.\nIn sum, five variables are employed to model drivers\u2019 lanekeeping and lane-departure characteristics.

Iterative Algorithm for Prediction\nThe proposed method must be able to predict the future trajectory based on the historical information \u03b61:t. This prediction is computed by iteratively applying the driver model defined in (9) and propagating the driving situation. The prediction algorithm is based on a kinematic point mass model for the ego vehicle and some assumptions as follows: \u2022 Over a short period of time, vehicle-speed changes are\nsmall and can be treated as a constant for the lanedeparture behavior, i.e., the vehicle speed is constant during the iteration process of prediction. The emergent brake behaviors, such as collision avoidance, are not considered. \u2022 Road curvature is continuous and can be differentiated. It changes slowly during the iteration process of prediction. To reduce calculation complexity, we consider driving scenarios on a road with a small curvature (\u03c1 < 10\u22124\nm\u22121).

Only when the TLC reaches a predefined criterion, is a warning sent, i.e.,\ntTLC < \u03c4 (15a) min{\u2206y\u0302t:t+q\u2206t} < \u03b31 (15b)\n\u2206y\u0302t+q\u2206t < \u03b32 (15c)\nIf the driving conditions (15a) \u2013 (15c) are valid, a warning is sent to drivers for the TLC-PDM method.

Performances for LDW system", "text": "Fig. 10 presents an example comparing different LDW algorithms using the basic TLC method and the TLC-PDM method for driver #10. We note that the basic TLC method is unable to predict or infer whether the driver will bring the vehicle back to the center of the driving lane.

Furthermore, we can note that a larger critical value (\u03c4 ) of TLC leads to a higher FAR, which tends to annoy drivers.\nFor the TLC-PDM method, we note that in region A in Fig. 10, the driver does not receive a warning from the LDW system, even though the vehicle is laterally crossing the boundary a little (i.e., less than 0.05 m) because the TLCPDM method can predict that the driver can steer the vehicle back to the center of the driving lane by him/herself in a short time. Region B is the same case as Region A.

A larger value of \u03b71, \u03b72 or \u03b73 indicates the corresponding method obtains a higher warning frequency.\nAccording to criteria (15a) \u2013 (15c), we know that NTLC\u2212PDM could not be larger than NTLC (i.e., \u03b71 \u2264 \u03b72) for the same driver, because the number of warning data points is always less than the total number of driving data. Fig. 11 gives an example of the influences of parameters q, \u03b31, and \u03b32 on the warning performance \u03b71 for driver #10 and the warning performance with the basic TLC is \u03b72 = 0.2034. The number of warning points increases with values of \u03b31 or \u03b32 increasing, but is always less than NTLC . For example, in Fig. 11, we can note that when (\u03b31, \u03b32) = (0.6, 0.6), \u03b71 approaches the maximum value but is always less than \u03b72 = 0.2034 for all q.\nFor a fixed q, we know that a larger value of parameters \u03b31 or/and \u03b32 generates a higher warning frequency. Parameters \u03b31 and \u03b32 in the warning strategy (15a) \u2013 (15c) allow designers to\n10\nset a preferred parameter for drivers. For instance, by setting a larger value of \u03b31, the warning frequency will be larger, but a larger \u03b31 can guarantee a higher safety level. Parameter \u03b31 has the same influence as parameter \u03b32 on warning frequency.\nFor the same value of parameters q, \u03b31 and \u03b32, the warning frequency also differs between drivers. Table II lists the experimental results of warning frequency for 10 drivers with parameters \u03b30 = 1, \u03b31 = \u22120.05, \u03b32 = 0.1, and q = 10. For driver #5 and driver #6 the TLC-PDM obtains a very lower warning frequency at about 0.013. Driver #1 and driver #10 can reach a middle level of warning frequency at about 0.08. For other drivers, however, the value of warning frequency is greater than 0.16. The difference across drivers is due to their differing driving styles. Drivers who prefer to drive a car in the middle of the road will naturally get a lower warning frequency; but some drivers, however, prefer to drive close to the road boundary. Fig. 12 presents the relationship between driving styles and warning frequency. We know that driver #5 and driver #6, who usually drive a vehicle in the center of the road (i.e., \u2206y \u2248 1.75 m, which is half the width of the driving lane), can get a lower warning frequency. Conversely, driver #3 and driver #4, who drive close to the boundary of the driving lane, get a higher warning frequency.\n2) False-Alarm Rate: We assess the performance of the LDW system using an FAR. The false warning event is recorded as a warning is triggered when the DCB occurs during the upcoming prediction interval. The FAR is computed by\n\u03bb = # of false warning event\n# of all warning event (20)\nFor example, when the prediction time is 1 s, if a warning is triggered at time t and the DCB will occur during [t, t+1], then the warning is a false warning. For the TLC-DSPLS method,\nthe DCB behavior is defined by the slope of a piecewise lateral displacement. See [8]. For the TLC-PDM method, the DCB is determined by parameter \u03b32.\nTo further show the benefits of the TLC-PDM method, we defined that the DCB occurred when the future lateral displacement \u2206yt+q\u2206t was larger than 0.1. Fig. 13 shows the experimental results of FAR for three different methods, where \u03b31 = \u22120.05. The average and standard variance values of FAR for driver #10 are recorded. The FAR for LDWS with the basic TLC method was from 18.8 % and 492.2 %. The FAR for the LDW system with the TLC-DSPLS method was from 6.44% and 198.1%. The FAR for the proposed TLC-PDM method was between 1.13 % and 74.51 %.\nFor the basic TLC method, the FAR will reach over 100 % when the prediction time is 1.5 s. For the TLC-DSPLS method, the FAR nearly reaches 100 % when the prediction time is 2.0 s because the average error of LCB and DCB classification increases fast with the increase in prediction time [8]. For the TLC-PDM method, the largest FAR is about 75 %, as the proposed prediction algorithm can predict the future lateral trajectory and its tendency."}, {"heading": "VI. FURTHER DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We proposed a TLC-PDM method for the LDW system, reducing the FAR caused by driver correction behavior. We\n11\nalso developed a model-based prediction algorithm for predicting vehicle trajectory and as a warning strategy for an LDW system. The experimental results show good performance for predicting the lateral trajectories of a vehicle. In this paper, we mainly focus on the framework of methods and the experiment validation in a driving scenario with small road curvature."}, {"heading": "A. Parameter Selection", "text": "In this research, the parameters (\u03b31, \u03b32, \u03c4 , and q) in the warning strategy were defined subjectively by the researchers. We should note that these parameters can be tuned and set according to different design requirements. For example, if the designers wish to pay more attention to the safety level than to the warning frequency, they can set a larger value of \u03b31 or/and \u03b32. Furthermore, from Fig. 12, we know that driving styles are highly related to warning performance. In future work, driver characteristics will be considered based on the TLC-PDM method to design a more driver-friendly LDW system.\nB. Vehicle Dynamics and Road Curvature\nIn the model-based prediction algorithm (Algorithm 1), the attributes of vehicle dynamics are not considered. Lateral trajectory prediction using vehicle dynamics (e.g., steering angle, brake/gas pedal position, acceleration) can improve the prediction accuracy [14]. In our work, we treated vehicle speed and road curvature as a constant during the iteration process and did not consider the effects of steering angle. Furthermore, road profiles (such as straight road or curved road with or without constant road curvature) greatly impact warning functions, see [14]. We use a simple TLC-based risk function to determine whether a warning should be given. In future work, we will take vehicle dynamics and more complicated road profiles into consideration in order to improve the performance of the TLC-PDM method."}, {"heading": "C. Driver State and Intention", "text": "We do not classify or recognize the drivers\u2019 physical and physiological states [31], such as the level of drowsiness or fatigue [10], [32], drunkenness, or, aggression [33]. Recognizing drivers\u2019 intentions, such as lane changing, is also beyond the scope in this paper. To design a more acceptable LDW system for drivers, drivers\u2019 intentions should be considered. Therefore, in future applications of the TLC-PDM method, drivers\u2019 lane change behaviors [34], [35] must be adequately recognized and considered."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, a new method (TLC-PDM method) for reducing the false-warning rate of lane-departure warning systems is proposed. First, we model driver behaviors using five variables, including vehicle speed, relative yaw angle, the change rate of the relative yaw angle, road curvature, and relative lateral displacement. Then a personalized driver model is developed by combining the Gaussian mixture model and the hidden Markov model. The model parameters are determined by learning from\nthe naturalistic driving data collected from 10 drivers. Based on the personalized driver model, a model-based prediction algorithm for predicting the upcoming lateral vehicle trajectory is proposed and validated. Second, based on personalized driver model and the proposed prediction algorithm, a warning strategy is also developed. We also discuss the influences of different parameters of warning strategy on the warning performance. Last, to show the advantages of the TLC-PDM method, we compare it with the basic TLC method and the TLC-DSPLS method. The experimental results show that the TLC-PDM method can predict the upcoming lateral trajectory of a vehicle and obtain the lowest false-warning rate of 3 % with 1 s prediction time."}, {"heading": "APPENDIX A", "text": "In this Appendix, the calculation method of transfer matrix, T , in Section III, C.

We propose a learning-based approach to predicting unintended lane-departure behaviors (LDB) and the chance for drivers to bring the vehicle back to the lane. First, in this approach, a personalized driver model for lanedeparture and lane-keeping behavior is established by combining the Gaussian mixture model and the hidden Markov model. Second, based on this model, we develop an online model-based prediction algorithm to predict the forthcoming vehicle trajectory and judge whether the driver will demonstrate an LDB or a DCB. We also develop a warning strategy based on the model-based prediction algorithm that allows the lane-departure warning system to be acceptable for drivers according to the predicted trajectory. In addition, the naturalistic driving data of 10 drivers is collected through the University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment program to train the personalized driver model and validate this approach. We compare the proposed method with a basic time-to-lane-crossing (TLC) method and a TLC-directional sequence of piecewise lateral slopes (TLC-DSPLS) method. The results show that the proposed approach can reduce the falsewarning rate to 3.07%.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
