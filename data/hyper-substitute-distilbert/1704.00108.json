During an online sale, a seller offers a handpicked assortment, i.e. a subset of products, to an arriving customer. The customer\u2019s purchase decision crucially depends on her offered assortment. She first scrutinizes all the products in the assortment, then decides which product she likes the most. After that, she either purchases her favorite, or purchases nothing if her willingness-to-pay is below the price for her favorite. Such choice behavior is captured by the underlying choice model, which has been under intense study by the economics and operations research communities [Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985].\nIn order to maximize the total revenue in an online sale, the seller needs to know the underlying choice model. However, the model is often not known in practice. This motivates the seller to maximize her revenue and learn the underlying choice model simultaneously. Apart from model uncertainty, the seller often faces resource constraints; when a product is sold, a certain amount of resources is consumed, and the resources cannot be replenished during the sales horizon. The seller is then forced to stop the sales process either when the sales horizon ends, or when the resources are depleted.\nIn this paper, we formulate a model for the online assortment optimization problem, which encompasses choice\nmodel uncertainty and resource constraints. The seller aims to minimize his regret, i.e. the difference between the revenue earned by an oracle, who knows the underlying choice model, and the revenue earned by the seller, who is uncertain about the model. We assume an uncertain MultiNomial Logit (MNL) model, which is fundamental in the literature. We first propose an efficient policy ONLINE(\u03c4) that incurs a regret O\u0303(T 2/3), where T is the number of customers, and \u03c4 is the length of the learning phase. Then, we propose a UCB policy with a regret of O\u0303( \u221a T ); the UCB policy is not known to be computationally efficient. Both regret bounds are sublinear in the total number of assortments, since we exploit the special structure of MNL choice model to avoid learning all the choice probabilities assortment by assortment."}, {"heading": "2 Literature Review and Our Contributions", "text": "Offline assortment optimization. TheMNL choice model is a fundamental model proposed by [McFadden, 1974], and it has been the building block for many other existing choice models [Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985]. Assortment optimization under the MNL choice model has been actively studied. Assuming the knowledge of the underlying MNL choice model, [Talluri and van Ryzin, 2004] propose an efficient algorithm for computing an optimal assortment when there is no resource constraint; [Liu and van Ryzin, 2008] propose an efficient algorithm for computing a mixture of assortments that achieves asymptotic optimality under resource constraints. [Bernstein et al., 2015] offer insights into the optimal assortment planning policy under resource constraints, when the product prices are equal but there are multiple types of customers.\nOnline assortment optimization. Assuming uncertainty in the MNL choice model, [Rusmevichientong et al., 2010] propose an online policy that incurs an instance-dependent O(log T ) regret. [Saure and Zeevi, 2013] generalize [Rusmevichientong et al., 2010] by proposing online policies with instance-dependent O(log T ) regret bounds for a wider class of choice models. Recently, [Agrawal et al., 2016] provide a instance-independent regret O\u0303( \u221a T ) under an uncertain MNL choice model. However, these existing works do not incorporate resource constraints into their models, unlike ours. Our approach is based on establishing a confidence bound on the choice probability for every\nassortment (cf. Lemmas 5.1, 5.2), which is novel in the literature, and necessary for learning the choice model under resource constraints.\nBudgeted bandits. Our online assortment optimization problem can be cast as a budgeted bandit problem, with the arm set being the allowed assortments. For budget bandit problems, [Tran-Thanh et al., 2010] provide an instance-indepenedent regret bound with a resource constraint; [Tran-Thanh et al., 2012] and [Xia et al., 2015a] provide instance-dependent regret bounds for the cases of discrete and continuous resource consumption costs. [Xia et al., 2015b] propose a Thompson Sampling based algorithm. [Badanidiyuru et al., 2013], [Agrawal and Devanur, 2014] provide optimal instanceindependent regret bounds for the problem with general resource constraints.\nA direct application of [Badanidiyuru et al., 2013] or [Agrawal and Devanur, 2014] to our problem yields a regret linear in the number of assortments, which is often larger than the number of customers. Indeed, their policies involve testing each assortment at least once. In contrast, we exploit the special structure of the MNL choice model to achieve a regret bound sublinear in the number of assortments.\nCombinatorial bandits. Our problem can be cast as a stochastic combinatorial bandit problem with semi-bandit feedback, when we relax the resource constraints, and interpret a product and an assortment as a basic arm and a super arm respectively. [Gai et al., 2012] study the combinatorial bandit problem with linear reward (i.e. a super arm\u2019s reward is the sum of its basic arms\u2019 reward), which is subsequently generalized and refined by [Chen et al., 2013] to the case with non-linear reward. The optimal regret bound is obtained by [Kveton et al., 2014] in the case of linear reward. [Chen et al., 2016] consider the generalized case when the expected reward under a super arm depends on certain random variables associated with its basic arms. [Xia et al., 2016] provide an instance-dependent regret bound to the combinatorial bandit problem with a resource constraint. Recent works [Radlinski et al., 2008], [Kveton et al., 2015a], [Kveton et al., 2015b] consider the problem in the cascading-feedback setting.\nApart from the presence of resource constraints (except [Xia et al., 2016]), our model differs from the existing combinatorial bandit literature, as our reward function is not monotonic in the super arm and the underlying parameters. Indeed, introducing more products in an assortment does not necessarily increase the expected revenue, since the customer\u2019s attention could be diverted to less profitable products. Therefore, novel techniques are needed for achieving a sublinear regret in our setting."}, {"heading": "3 Problem Definition", "text": "We formulate the online assortment optimization problem with an unknown MultiNomial Logit (MNL) choice model. The seller has a set of products N = {1, . . . , N} for sale, and a set of resources K = {1, . . . ,K} for composing the products. The sale of one product i generates a revenue of r(i) \u2208 [0, 1], but consumes a(i, k) \u2208 {0, 1} units of resource\nk, for each k \u2208 K. Product 0 is the \u201cno-purchase\u201d product; r(0) = 0 = a(0, k) for all k \u2208 K. The seller starts with C(k) = Tc(k) \u2208 Z+ units of resource k at period 1. For periods t = 1, . . . , T , the following sequence of six events happen. First, a customer arrives in period t. Second, the seller offers an assortment St \u2208 S to the customer, where S is the family of allowed assortments. Third, the seller observes that the product It \u2208 St \u222a {0} is purchased. Fourth, the seller earns a revenue of r(It). Fifth, the resources are consumed: for all k \u2208 K, C(k) \u2190 C(k)\u2212 a(It, k). Sixth, the seller proceeds to period t+ 1. A customer\u2019s purchase decision is governed by the MNL choice probability function \u03d5(\u00b7, \u00b7|v\u2217) [McFadden, 1974]. v\u2217 \u2208 RN>0 is the latent utility parameter unknown to the seller; the seller only knows that v\u2217(i) \u2208 [1/R,R] for all i \u2208 N . For i \u2208 S \u2282 N and v \u2208 RN>0, \u03d5(i, S|v) represents the probability of a customer purchasing i when she is offered assortment S, and has utility parameter v. The probability is defined as\n\u03d5(i, S|v) := v(i) 1 + \u2211\n\u2113\u2208S v(\u2113) . (1)\nThe customer purchases nothing with the complementary probability \u03d5(0, S|v) = 1/(1 + \u2211\u2113\u2208S v(\u2113)) = 1 \u2212\u2211\ni\u2208S \u03d5(i, S|v). For i \u2208 N\\S, S \u2208 S, we define\u03d5(i, S|v) = 0. The expected revenue \u2211\ni\u2208S r(i)\u03d5(i, S|v) is not monotonic in S or v, in contrary to the monotonicity of reward functions in the combinatorial bandit literature. The family of allowed assortments S is a subfamily of 2N . One common example is the cardinality constrained family S = {S \u2282 N : |S| \u2264 B}. We assume that \u2205 \u2208 S; that is, the seller can reject a customer by offering an empty assortment, for example when the resources are depleted. We denoteB = max{|S| : S \u2208 S} as the maximum assortment size; in most setting, B is much smaller than N , the number of products. Regret Minimization. The seller\u2019s objective is to design a non-anticipatory policy that maximizes the total revenue \u2211T\nt=1 r(It), subject to the resource constraints. This can be formulated as the minimization of regret, which is\nREG = TOPT(LP(v\u2217))\u2212 T\u2211\nt=1\nr (It) , (2)\nsubject to the resource constraints: for all k \u2208 K, \u2211T\nt=1 a(It, k) \u2264 Tc(k) always. Equivalently, we require C(k) \u2265 0 at every period. The purchased product It depends on the offered assortment St determined by the policy. We say that a policy is non-anticipatory if the offered assortment St depends only on the sales history as well as the seller\u2019s randomness Ut in period t, i.e. St \u2208 \u03c3(Ut, {Ss, Is, Us}t\u22121s=1). For any v \u2208 RN>0, the linear program LP(v) is defined as\nmax \u2211\nS\u2208S\nR(S|v)y(S)\ns.t. \u2211\nS\u2208S A(S, k|v)y(S) \u2264 c(k) \u2200k \u2208 K \u2211\nS\u2208S\ny(S) = 1, y(S) \u2265 0 \u2200S \u2208 S.\nWe use the notation R(S|v) = \u2211i\u2208S r(i)\u03d5(i, S|v) to denote the expected revenue earned by offering S in a period, and A(S, k|v) = \u2211i\u2208S a(i, k)\u03d5(i, S|v) to denote the expected amount of resource k consumed in a period. The optimal value of LP(v) is denoted as OPT(LP(v)). By interpreting y as a probability distribution over S, LP(v) is equivalent to the maximization of the expected revenue in a period, when the resource constraints hold in expectation. LP(v) is always feasible, since y(\u2205) = 1, y(S) = 0 for all S \u2208 S \\ {\u2205} is a feasible solution. The benchmark TOPT(LP(v\u2217)) upper bounds the expected optimum [Badanidiyuru et al., 2013]:\nTheorem 3.1 ([Badanidiyuru et al., 2013]). For any nonanticipatory policy \u03c0 that satisfies the resource constraints with probability 1, the following inequality holds:\nTOPT(LP(v\u2217)) \u2265 E [ T\u2211\nt=1\nr (I\u03c0t )\n]\n.\nI\u03c0t denotes the random product purchased by the period t customer under policy \u03c0."}, {"heading": "4 Online policy ONLINE(\u03c4)", "text": "We propose the non-anticipatory policy ONLINE(\u03c4), where \u03c4 is the length of the learning phase.

In particular, the choice \u03c4 = (TRB)2/3N1/3 minimizes the regret bound up to a constant factor, yielding the bound O\u0303((TRB)2/3N1/3).\nOur regret bound is sublinear inN,B, in deep contrast with the regret bounds by applying [Badanidiyuru et al., 2013], [Agrawal and Devanur, 2014], which are linear in |S| = \u0398(NB). For our theoretical analysis, we assume the following on \u03c4 :\nAssumption 4.2. The learning phase length \u03c4 satisfies: (i) For all k \u2208 K, \u03c4 \u221a\nlog 4NK\u03b4 \u2264 Tc(k).

(5)\nAssumption 4.2 (i) ensures that no resource is depleted during the learning phase, and (ii) ensures that the learning phase is long enough for estimating v\u2217. Assumption 4.2 is only necessary for our analysis; ONLINE(\u03c4) can be implemented for any choice of 1 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 T . In our simulation results in \u00a76, ONLINE(T 2/3) still converges to optimal, even when the assumption is violated for the choice \u03c4 = T 2/3. (Theorem 4.1 implies a regret of O\u0303(T 2/3RB \u221a N) if \u03c4 = T 2/3 satisfies Assumption 4.2.)

Periods 1 to \u03c4 are the learning phase, and periods \u03c4 + 1 to T are the earning phase. During the learning phase, the seller offers single item assortments in order to estimate {v\u2217(i)}i\u2208N . When the learning phase ends, he computes the MLE v\u0302(i) for each product. v\u0302(i) is a solution to minv\u2208[1/R,R] Li(v). The negative log likelihood Li(v) is\n=\u2212 log\n\n \ni\u03c4/N \u220f\ns= (i\u22121)\u03c4 N +1\n( v\n1 + v\n)1(Is=i) ( 1\n1 + v\n)1(Is=0)\n\n \n=n(i) log\n[\n1 + 1\nv\n]\n+ ( \u03c4\nN \u2212 n(i)\n)\nlog [1 + v] , (6)\nwhere n(i) = \u2211i\u03c4/N\ns=((i\u22121)\u03c4/N)+1 1(Is = i) is the number of\nproduct i sold during the learning phase. After that, we solve LP(v\u0302) for an extreme point solution y\u0302, which can be interpreted as a probability distribution over S. Finally, in the earning phase, we offer S \u2208 S with probability y\u0302(S) each period. At the end of a period, the seller signals ABORT when some resource is depleted, i.e. C(k) = 0. Then, the seller offers empty assortments to subsequent customers, until the end of sales horizon. This ensures that the resource constraints are satisfied with probability 1. Computational Efficiency of ONLINE(\u03c4). The most computationally onerous step in ONLINE(\u03c4) is to solve LP(v\u0302), which has |S| = \u0398(NB) many variables. Fortunately, by [Liu and van Ryzin, 2008], LP(v\u0302) can be efficiently solved by the Column Generation algorithm (CG). In each iteration of CG, we solve the reduced problem maxS\u2208S R\u0303(S|v\u0302) = maxS\u2208S \u2211\ni\u2208S r\u0303(i)\u03d5(i, S|v\u0302), where r\u0303(i) is a suitably defined reduced revenue coefficient for i. The reduced problem is polynomial time solvable for many choices of S, such as S = {S : |S| \u2264 B} [Rusmevichientong et al., 2010]. In our simulations in \u00a7 6, CG always terminates within 50 iterations for solving LP(v\u0302). Finally, the support of y\u0302, which is defined as\nsupp(y\u0302) := {S \u2208 S : y\u0302(S) > 0}, has size \u2264 K + 1, since y\u0302 is an extreme point solution to LP(v). Thus, it is easy to sample St in the earning phase. A O\u0303( \u221a T ) regret policy. A O\u0303( \u221a T ) regret can be achieved by a UCB policy:\nTheorem 4.3. There exists a UCB policy that satisfies the resource constraints and achieves a regret of O (\u221a\nTR3B5/2N log TNK\u03b4\n)\nwith probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4. The design and analysis of such a UCB policy is deferred to Appendices D - G. Different from ONLINE(\u03c4), our UCB policy is not known to be empirically efficient."}, {"heading": "5 Overview of the Proof for Theorem 4.1", "text": "To begin the proof, we consider the period tlast of last sale.

(7)\nTo prove the Theorem, it suffices to show that the probability (7) is at least 1\u2212 \u03b4. Parsing the calculation above. In step (\u2217), we consider the event tlast \u2264 \u03c1, where \u03c1 is the constant\n\u03c1 = TC\u01eb(\u03c4)\nmink\u2208K c(k) +\n\u221a\nT log 4(K+1)\u03b4\nmink\u2208K c(k) , (8)\nand \u01eb(\u03c4) is defined in (5). The definition of \u03c1 is motivated in the subsequent analysis. The inequality (\u2217) is evidently true, since the probability does not increase when we require the additional event tstop > T \u2212 \u03c1 to hold. To ease the analysis, we decouple the revenue and the constraints at step (\u2020), by considering the process {S\u0303t, I\u0303t}T\u2212\u03c1t=\u03c4+1 generated in Procedure 2.

The process {S\u0303t, I\u0303t}T\u2212\u03c1t=\u03c4+1 is closely related to the sales process {St, It}T\u2212\u03c1t=\u03c4+1 in Algorithm 1. We remark that: (i) If tlast > T\u2212\u03c1, {S\u0303t, I\u0303t}T\u2212\u03c1t=\u03c4+1 and {St, It}T\u2212\u03c1t=\u03c4+1 are identically distributed.

While Procedure 2 requires knowing v\u2217, we emphasize that these samples are only used in our analysis. In particular, Procedure 2 is not needed in Algorithm 1.\nWe argue that the step (\u2020) is true.

If the event Ek holds for all k, then the amount of resource k consumed by the end of period T \u2212 \u03c1 is at most Tc(k) for all k. This means that ABORT is not yet signaled, which implies tstop > T \u2212\u03c1. By replacing {St, It} with {S\u0303t, I\u0303t}, we can then analyze the events EREG , {Ek}Kk=1 separately, which eases our analysis.\nThe step (\u2021) holds, since the probability does not increase when we require the additional event Ev\u0302 to hold.

(9)\nThe event Ev\u0302 implies that MLE v\u0302 is an accurate estimator for v\u2217, with the specified confidence radius. Now, we show that the probability (7) is at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4. This is the heart of our proof for the regret bound.\nProving that the probability (7)\u2265 1\u2212 \u03b4. This is proved by combining Lemmas 5.1-5.5. Their proofs are deferred to Appendix B. First, we argue that the MLE v\u0302 is sufficiently accurate, in the sense that the event Ev\u0302 happens with high probability:\nLemma 5.1. For any \u03c4 \u2265 N , P[Ev\u0302] \u2265 1\u2212 \u03b4/2. The proof involves a change of variable v = e\u03b8, and uses the strong convexity of Li(e\u03b8) in \u03b8. We next bound the probability P [ EREG \u2229 \u22c2K k=1 Ek | Ev\u0302 ] by the following four Lemmas. We translate the accuracy in estimating v\u2217 to the accuracy in estimating the choice probability for every assortment:\nLemma 5.2. For all v, v\u2032 \u2208 RN>0, b \u2208 [0, 1]N and S \u2282 N , the following inequality holds:\n\u2211\ni\u2208S\nb(i) (\u03d5(i, S|v)\u2212 \u03d5(i, S|v\u2032)) \u2264 \u2211\ni\u2208S\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 log v(i)\nv\u2032(i)\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 .\nLemma 5.2 establishes the Lipschitz continuity of \u03d5(i, S|v) in log v. Altogether, Lemmas 5.1, 5.2 demonstrate that the choice probability under every assortment can be learned without testing every assortment. Furthermore, the Lemmas show that |R(S|v\u0302)\u2212R(S|v\u2217)| = O(1/\u221a\u03c4 ) for all S \u2208 S , and that |A(S, k|v\u0302)\u2212A(S, k|v\u2217)| = O(1/\u221a\u03c4 ) for all S \u2208 S, k \u2208 K. This leads to the following Lemma: Lemma 5.3. Condition on Ev\u0302 (cf. (9)), we have OPT(LP(v\u0302)) \u2265 [\n1\u2212 B\u01eb(\u03c4) mink\u2208K{c(k)}\n]\nOPT(LP(v\u2217))\u2212B\u01eb(\u03c4).\nAssumption 4.2 (ii) ensures that B\u01eb(\u03c4)\nmink\u2208K{c(k)} < 1. Using\nLemma 5.3, we first prove the near optimality in revenue:\nLemma 5.4. We have P [EREG | Ev\u0302] \u2265 1\u2212 \u03b42(K+1) . The proof involves a decomposition of the regret in revenue and applications of Chernoff inequality. Finally, we also argue that resource k are not fully consumed before period T \u2212 \u03c1. Lemma 5.5. We have P [Ek | Ev\u0302] \u2265 1\u2212 \u03b42(K+1) for all k \u2208 K. The proof for Lemma 5.5 is similar to the proof of Lemma 5.4. Altogether, the regret bound in Theorem 4.1 is proved."}, {"heading": "6 Numerical Experiments", "text": "We evaluate the performance of ONLINE(T 2/3) with synthetic data, with varying model parameters. By Theorem 4.1, it incurs a regret O\u0303(T 2/3RB \u221a N). We define a class tuple \u0393 as (S, N,K,R), and consider random problems model generated based on {\u0393i}3i=1 and 8 sales horizon lengths {T (q)}8q=1, which are defined below:\n\u03931 = (S1(6), 10, 5, 3), \u03932 = (S1(9), 15, 6, 5),\n\u03933 = (S1(15), 25, 8, 7), T = [250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 5000, 10000].\nHere, we denote S1(B) = {S \u2282 N : |S| \u2264 B}. The tuples \u03931,\u03932,\u03933 are ordered with increasing difficulty; the number of assortments in \u03931,\u03932,\u03933 are 210, 5005 and 3.27\u00d7106 respectively. In many cases (especially \u03933), there are more possible assortments than the number of periods, which makes the existing budgeted bandit policies (cf. \u00a7 2) infeasible. For each (\u0393i, T (q)), we generate 5 random problem models. Then, for each of the problem models, we run ONLINE(T (q)2/3) 200 times, over the synthetic data generated with the model. After that, for each model, we compute two quantities: (a) the average revenue-to-optimum ratio, which is the earned revenue averaged over the 200 simulation runs divided by T (q)OPT(LP(v\u2217)), and (b) the average regret, which is T (q)OPT(LP(v\u2217)) minus the earned revenue averaged over the 200 runs. Finally, for each (\u0393i, T (q)), we further average the quantities (a, b) over the 5 generated models. ONLINE(\u03c4) is very efficient via the use of CG (cf. \u00a7 4). In our simulation, CG always terminates in 50 iterations, and each run can be simulated in less than 10 seconds for models from \u03933.\nTo further study the convergence of our policy, we examine the how often ONLINE(T 2/3) correctly identify supp(y\u2217) after the learning phase. (Recall the notation supp(y) = {S \u2208 S : y(S) > 0}.) In Table 1, for each class tuple and T we tabulate the fraction of instances, out of 200 runs, where supp(y\u0302) = supp(y\u2217). This is a stringent criterion, since supp(y\u0302) could be different from supp(y\u2217) because of multiplicity in the optimal solutions for LP(v\u2217), and near optimality could still be achieved without supp(y\u0302) = supp(y\u2217). However, ONLINE(T 2/3) is still able to identify the support in small instances. Additional simulation results show similar trend of convergence and effectiveness in short sales horizon.

Here, {N1, . . .Np} is a partition of N into p equal size subsets, where Nj = {(N(j \u2212 1)/p) + 1, . . . , Nj/p}. (Thus, we implicitly assume that N is divisible by p).

The following statement is the full version of Theorem 4.3:\nTheoremD.1. Assume that\u03c9 < 1, where\u03c9 is defined in (31). Algorithm 3 satisfies the resource constraints with probability"}, {"heading": "1, and achieves a regret of", "text": "O (\u221a TR3B5/2N log TNK\n\u03b4\n)\nwith probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4.\nThe assumption of \u03c9 < 1 ensures that the sales horizon is long enough for sufficient learning. We further explain the rationale behind the assumption in the analysis.\nWe remark that, while the regret bound for the UCB policy (Algorithm 3) has a better dependence on T than ONLINE(\u03c4), the former has a poorer dependence on R,B,N than the latter. It is because the UCB policy estimates the underlying utility parameter v\u2217 with a stream of assortments S1, S2, . . . (and the corresponding purchase outcomes I1, I2, . . .) of arbitrary sizes. Thus, the UCB policy needs to disentangle the dependence between different products in each offered assortment during the estimation. This situation is in contrast to ONLINE(\u03c4), which estimates v\u2217 by inferring from single item assortments (and the corresponding purchase outcome). Therefore, ONLINE(\u03c4) does not need to go through the disentangling process, leading to a better dependence on the parameters R,B,N than our UCB policy. Nevertheless, since ONLINE(\u03c4) separates learning from earning, its dependence on T is strictly worse than the UCB policy, which simultaneously learns and earns.\nOur UCB policy is stated in Algorithm 3. The signal ABORT ensures that the resource constraints are satisfied with probability 1.\nAlgorithm 3 UCB Policy\n1: Initialize C(k) = Tc(k) \u2200k \u2208 K, and fixed assortments {Si}Ni=1 such that i \u2208 Si \u2208 S.\n2: for t = 1, . . . , N do \u22b2 Warm Start 3: Offer St, and observe It. 4: For all k \u2208 K, C(k) \u2190 C(k) \u2212 a(It, k). 5: end for 6: for t = N + 1, . . . , T do 7: Compute theMLE vt in (25), based on {(Ss, Is)}t\u22121s=1. 8: Solve UCB-LP(vt, nt\u22121, \u03c9) for an optimal y\u0302t. 9: Offer an assortment St \u2208 S with probability y\u0302t(St). 10: Observe the product It purchased. 11: For all k \u2208 K, C(k) \u2190 C(k) \u2212 a(It, k). 12: if \u2203k \u2208 K s.t.

Different from LP(v\u0302) (which is used in ONLINE(\u03c4)), it is not known if UCB-LP(vt, nt\u22121, \u03c9) can be efficiently solved (at least empirically) by the Column Generation algorithm or any other algorithm or heuristic.\nThe incorporation of confidence bounds into UCBLP(vt, nt\u22121, \u03c9) is inspired by [Agrawal and Devanur, 2014] as well as the primal-dual algorithm in [Badanidiyuru et al., 2013]. However, our design of the confidence bounds and the analysis are substantially different. As remarked in the design of ONLINE(\u03c4), We cannot afford to learn all the choice probabilities {\u03d5(i, S|v\u2217)}i\u2208N ,S\u2208S individually, which would be the case if we just directly apply [Agrawal and Devanur, 2014][Badanidiyuru et al., 2013]. Instead, we need to first provide a confidence bound on v\u2217, and then translate it to corresponding confidence bounds for the choice probabilities. The curse of dimensionality in learning is thus avoided. Different from ONLINE(\u03c4), the confidence bounds for the UCB policy is adaptively defined every period.\nIn the following, we outline the proof of Theorem D.1 in Appendix E, and then prove the auxiliary Lemmas and Theorem in Appendices F - H.\nE Proving the O\u0303( \u221a T ) Regret\nFirst, we note that one particular challenge in analyzing the UCB policy is that it ABORTs at the random period \u03c4 when C(k) = 0. This makes the analysis of total revenue earned difficult. This is similar to the difficulty in analyzing ONLINE(\u03c4). Thus, to facilitate the analysis, we consider the following sales process (S\u0303t, I\u0303t) T t=1 generated by Procedure 4. In Procedure 4, the notation I\u0303t \u223c S\u0303t denotes sampling a product I\u0303t from S\u0303t \u222a {0} with the underlying choice probability \u03d5(I\u0303t, S\u0303t|v\u2217). We define n\u0303t\u22121(i) = \u2211t\u22121 s=1 1(i \u2208 S\u0303s), similar to the definition of nt\u22121(i) in (29). We emphasize that (S\u0303t, I\u0303t) T t=1 is only used for the analysis; the online algorithm does not need to know how to generate such a process. This is similar to the use of Procedure 2 for analyzing ONLINE(\u03c4).\nNote that (S\u0303t, I\u0303t) T t=1 is closely related to the sale process (St, It) T t=1 generated by Algorithm 3. Let tstop be the period when Algorithm 3 signals ABORT; define tstop = T if no ABORT is signaled. When Algorithm 3 does not signal ABORT, the processes (S\u0303t, I\u0303t, v\u0303t, n\u0303t) T t=1 and (St, It, vt, nt) T t=1 are identically distributed. However, if an ABORT is signaled at period tstop, then (S\u0303t, I\u0303t, v\u0303t, n\u0303t) tstop t=1 and (St, It, vt, nt) tstop t=1 are still identically distributed, but St = \u2205 = It for t \u2265 tstop + 1, which is in general distributed differently from (S\u0303t, I\u0303t) T t=tstop+1. Moreover, our UCB policy satisfies the resource constraints with probability 1, i.e. \u2211T\nt=1 a(It, k) \u2264 Tc(k) with certainty; but \u2211T\nt=1 a(I\u0303t, k) > Tc(k) violate the constraints with positive (despite being exponentially small) probability. Now, we have for any target regret bound BOUND the following inequality:\nP [Regret \u2264 BOUND]\n=P\n[\nTOPT(LP(v\u2217))\u2212 tstop\u2211\nt=1\nr(It) \u2264 BOUND ]\n\u2265P [ TOPT(LP(v\u2217))\u2212 T\u2211\nt=1\nr(It) \u2264 BOUND, no ABORT ]\n=P\n[{\nTOPT(LP(v\u2217))\u2212 T\u2211\nt=1\nr(I\u0303t) \u2264 BOUND }\n\u2229 { T\u2211\nt=1\na(I\u0303t, k) \u2264 Tc(k) for all k. }] .\nTo prove Theorem D.1, it suffices to prove the following two Lemmas:\nLemma E.1. We have\nP\n[\nTOPT(LP(v\u2217))\u2212 T\u2211\nt=1\nr(I\u0303t)\n= O\u0303 (\u221a TR3B5/2N )]\n\u2265 1\u2212 \u03b4 K + 1 .\nLemma E.2.

Then Et holds with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4/(2(K + 1)T ).\nThe proof of Theorem E.3 is first outlined in Appendix E.1, and the main Theorem in Appendix E.1 is proved in Appendix F.

Similar to the proof of Lemma 5.1, we consider the following change in variables v(i) = e\u03b8(i), and the function Lt(\u03b8) = Lt((\u03b8(1), . . . , \u03b8(N))) = Lt((e\u03b8(1), . . . , e\u03b8(N)))). The constant \u03a8 is an artifact of the strong convexity of Lt in \u03b8. A crucial part of the proof involves demonstrating the concentration property of \u2207Lt(\u03b8\u2217), the gradient of Lt at \u03b8\u2217 = (\u03b8\u2217(i))i\u2208N = (log v\n\u2217(i))i\u2208N . However, the classical Azuma-Hoeffding or Chernoof inequality is not directly applicable, since the frequency n\u0303t\u22121(i) is a random variable that correlates with {(S\u0303s, I\u0303s)}t\u22121s=1. This is in contrast to the analysis in the proof of Lemma 5.1, where the number of observations on product i is fixed to be \u03c4/N . Thus, we employ the following concentration inequality, which is commonly used in the multi-armed bandit literature:\nLemma E.5 ([Abbasi-yadkori et al., 2011],[Bubeck et al., 2011]). Let {Ft}\u221et=1 be a filtration. Let \u03c1(t) \u2208 {0, 1} be a binary Ft\u22121-measurable random variable, and let \u03b7(t) be a Ft-measurable random variable that is conditionally centered and Ft\u22121\u2212conditionally L-subGaussian, i.e. E[\u03b7(t) | Ft\u22121] = 0 a.s. and E[e\u03bb\u03b7(t) | Ft\u22121] \u2264 e(\u03bbL)\n2/2 for all \u03bb \u2208 R. Then the confidence bound \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u03c4\u2211\nt=1\n\u03c1(t)\u03b7(t) \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2264 L \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a ( 1 + \u03c4\u2211\nt=1\n\u03c1(t)\n) (\n1 + 2 log \u03c4\n\u03b4\n)\n(34)\nholds with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4. The Lemma follows from either the application of Doob\u2019s Optional Sampling Theorem with Azuma-Hoeffding inequality (for example see the proof of Lemma 15 in [Bubeck et al., 2011]), or from the theory of selfnormalizing processes (for example, see Lemma 6 in [Abbasi-yadkori et al., 2011])\nIn particular, Theorem E.4 implies that the confidence bound \u2223\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 log v\u0303t(i)\nv\u2217(i)\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2264 \u03b5(n\u0303t\u22121(i)) (35)\nholds for all product i \u2208 N with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4/2T (K + 1). Finally, combining (35) with Lemma 5.2, Theorem E.3 is proved."}, {"heading": "F Proof of Theorem E.4", "text": "Recall that Lt\u22121(v) in the Theorem is the negative loglikelihood under the samples {S\u0303s, I\u0303s}t\u22121s=1 generated by Procedure 4.

To complete the proof, we prove (38), (39). Proving (38). The partial derivative has the following expression:\n\u2202Lt \u2202\u03b8(i) \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u03b8=\u03b8\u2217 = \u2211\ns\u2208{1,...,t\u22121}:\nS\u0303s\u220bi\n\u03d5(i, S\u0303s|v\u2217)\u2212 1(I\u0303s = i)\n=\nt\u22121\u2211\ns=1\n\u03c1s(i) ( \u03d5(i, S\u0303s|v\u2217)\u2212 1(I\u0303s = i) ) ,\nwhere \u03c1s(i) = 1(S\u0303s \u220b i) is the indicator random variable of product i being in the assortment S\u0303s in the s th period. Now, define the filtration Fs\u22121 = \u03c3({(S\u0303\u03c4 , I\u0303\u03c4 )}s\u22121\u03c4=1 \u222a {S\u0303s}), the \u03c3-algebra generated by {(S\u0303\u03c4 , I\u0303\u03c4 )}s\u22121\u03c4=1 \u222a {S\u0303s}. Then the indicator \u03c1s(i) and the probability \u03d5(i, S\u0303s|v\u2217) are Fs\u22121-measurable, and the purchased product I\u0303s at period s is Fs-measurable. Now, we have E[1(I\u0303s = i)|Fs\u22121] = \u03d5(i, S\u0303s|v\u2217), and clearly \u03d5(i, S\u0303s|v\u2217) \u2212 1(I\u0303s = i) is 1- subGaussian.

(42)\nNow, we focus on the Hessian matrix hs(\u03b8) for the s th period sample (S\u0303s, I\u0303s). (We have Ht\u22121(\u03b8) = \u2211t\u22121\ns=1 hs(\u03b8).) By (41), (42), the Hessian matrix hs(\u03b8) can be expressed as follows:\nhs(\u03b8) = 1\n(1 + \u2211\ni\u2208S\u0303s e\u03b8(i))2 \u00d7 \n      \ne\u03b8(1)1(1 \u2208 S\u0303s) 0 0 0 0 0 e\u03b8(2)1(2 \u2208 S\u0303s) 0 0 0 0 0 . . . 0 0\n0 0 0 . . . 0 0 0 0 0 e\u03b8(N)1(N \u2208 S\u0303s)\n\n      \n+ \u2211\n1\u2264i<j\u2264N : i,j\u2208S\u0303s\ne\u03b8(i)+\u03b8(j)uTi,jui,j ,\nwhere the vector ui,j = ei\u2212ej, and ei is the ith standard basis vector. Now, each term in the second summation is positive semi-definite. Applying the bound v = e\u03b8(i) \u2208 [\u2212R,R] for all i \u2208 N , and the model assumption that |S| \u2264 B for all S \u2208 S, we have\nhs(\u03b8) 1\nR(1 +BR)2 \u00d7\n\n      \n1(1 \u2208 S\u0303s) 0 0 0 0 0 1(2 \u2208 S\u0303s) 0 0 0 0 0 . . . 0 0\n0 0 0 . . . 0 0 0 0 0 1(N \u2208 S\u0303s)\n\n       ,\n(43)\nand summing the inequality (43) over 1 \u2264 s \u2264 t \u2212 1 yields (39).

The inequality (48) is based on the following observation. Fix a particular product i, and let S\u0303t1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , S\u0303tm be the assortments that includes i from period N + 1 to period T , where N + 1 \u2264 t1 < t2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < tm.

The inequality (49) is by Jensen\u2019s Inequality. Finally, the inequality (50) is by the fact that at most B products can be included in each of the T assortments.

The seller aims to maximize the total revenue in a finite sales horizon, subject to resource constraints and uncertainty in the MNL choice model.
