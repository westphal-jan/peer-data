INTRODUCTION", "text": "Orbital debris is internationally recognized as a global problem. It poses a threat to persons and spacecraft\nin orbit, and is a potential barrier to future spaceflight. The orbital debris problem thereby presents us with an opportunity for international cooperation, and should be understood within the broader context of improving space situational awareness (SSA) for planetary defense, scientific knowledge, and preserving the future of space travel. SSA encompasses knowledge of the space environment, including that of natural and human-made objects in orbital, near-Earth and deep space regions. Knowledge of orbital debris is therefore part of SSA. Orbital debris data, then, is SSA data.\nThis paper focuses on one area for that cooperative potential\u2014data sharing\u2014and the part it plays in\nresolving the orbital debris problem. Originally conceived in 2011, this project concept involves researching the potential of ontology as a partial approach toward data-sharing, interoperability and knowledge discovery for the orbital debris domain. The idea is to exchange data among orbital debris and SSA communities by using (and creating) ontologies and employing formal ontological methods. Orbital debris data sharing will improve the state SSA, placing the global community in a more informed position toward orbital debris resolution. The foundational goal and motivation for this research is therefore to contribute to solving or otherwise alleviating the hazards of orbital debris, and to improve peaceful SSA. Furthermore, with greater (ideally actionable) situational knowledge of the broader space environment\u2014near Earth to deep space regions\u2014comes increased ability for planetary defense.\nIn what follows I sketch an ontological architecture for the domain of orbital debris. Specific goals of this\nontological system include:\nI. Orbital debris and SSA domain knowledge representation II. Annotation of debris and SSA data\nIII. Orbital debris and SSA data-sharing IV. The specification and formalization of an orbital debris terminology/vocabulary that is faithful\nto the respective domain knowledge and expertise.\nAnd in so doing\u2026\nV. Contribute to: orbital debris remediation, improving SSA and space safety\nAside from the potential for computational utility vis-a-vis space informatics and space data management, a\nbroader benefit of this project is the conceptual and philosophical analysis (and clarification) of the relevant orbital and space concepts. It is an interdisciplinary enterprise requiring the expertise and efforts from persons in astrodynamics, astroinformatics, ontology (philosophical, formal, and applied), data modeling, knowledge representation and reasoning, and computer science.\nThe paper is divided thusly: I summarize the problems in sections 2 and 3. Section 4 discusses ontology,\nand 5 outlines my orbital debris ontology. Section 6 presents the architecture with closing remarks in 7."}, {"heading": "2. THE ORBITAL DEBRIS PROBLEM AND SPACE SITUATIONAL", "text": ""}, {"heading": "AWARENESS", "text": "Orbital debris is human-made, Earth-orbiting objects that are no longer usable. Examples include\ninoperative spacecraft, their segments; miscellaneous astronautical artifacts; as well as satellite fragments from normal operations, collisions, or explosions. The primary sources of orbital debris are collisions and explosions. The size and shape of debris vary: there are more than 21,000 objects larger than 10 cm, over 700,000 between 1 and 10 cm, and over 100 million smaller than 1 cm (NASA Orbital Debris Office). The orbital lifetime of debris varies as well: debris at 800 km altitude and debris above 1000 km remain in orbit for decades to over a century, respectively.\nThere are a number of hazards posed by orbital debris (Scientific American). Given their high velocities,\nlifetimes, and growing numbers (Figures 1, 2), there is a risk of damage to operational satellites. The probability of catastrophic events is currently low, but \u2015[a]s the debris population grows, more collisions will occur\u2016 (European Space Agency). \u2015[T]he continuing growth in space debris poses an increasing threat to economically and scientifically vital orbital regions\u2016 (ESA Global Experts) by increasing the spatial density of debris. This raises the likelihood of collision events and makes navigation more hazardous. Furthermore, as critical orbital regions become more congested debris pose a greater hindrance to astronomical observations. A task we are faced with is \u2015[\u2026] to prevent a cascade of self-sustaining collisions from setting in over the next few decades.\u2016(ESA Global Experts) The hazard of space debris also extend to Earth: debris of sufficient size pose a risk (albeit low) of harm and damage to persons and property on Earth.\nFig.1. Debris growth of objects \u226510cm, by type (ODQ, 2014).\nOrbital debris is therefore a risk to satellites, spacecraft, human life, and has the potential to severely limit,\nif not prevent, future spaceflight. To the extent that debris limits access to space, and preventative actions are not taken, we are essentially trapping ourselves in. This is the orbital debris problem.\nResolving the orbital debris problem entails debris prevention, mitigation and remediation measures, the\nlatter of which involves the development of technologies to physically remove debris. It also includes the enactment of policy that outlines requirements (Johnson and Stansbery 2010; United Nations 2010; U.S. Government), strategies, and methods to minimize the production of debris, as well as management of debris.\nA necessary part of the solution to the orbital debris problem is accurate and actionable space situational\nawareness. We observe the space environment, detect, locate, identify, track, and predict debris objects and their orbital paths. Both ground-based and space-based sensors (radar and optical telescopes, etc.) are used to toward these ends. Table 1 presents a non-exhaustive list of sensors, tracking stations, sensor networks and observers that gather or process SSA data (including debris), or that maintain space object catalogs (Vallado and Griesbach 2011).\n1 European Space Agency Space Object Catalog\nAny given organization tracking space debris acquires large amounts of data, yet \u2015[n]one of the existing\nnetworks and SSA initiatives provides complete coverage or a comprehensive catalogue of all objects in orbit. The sharing of data is also limited.\u2016 (Kretzenbacher et al 2012, emphasis added). The United States, for instance, maintains an extensive system and makes some data available, but \u2015there are gaps in its coverage and catalog\u2016 (Weeden 2014). What more, given that it is primarily military-centric, data-sharing is not entirely at a premium (Becker and Chow 2012). The above sources of space object observational data, as well those under development and those yet to be constructed, are therefore potential partners in data-sharing initiatives toward more complete SSA. Their particular databases, space object catalogs, and information systems are candidate elements to be made interoperable via the use of ontologies or other data and knowledge management means.\nThe improvement of SSA for all orbital, near-earth and deep-space objects is critical for national security\nand planetary defense. In pooling data and resources toward better SSA, the individual parties expand their knowledge. Collectively they are in a better position for improving space safety and planetary defense.\n\u2015Improving SSA for all space actors is critical to space activities and the long\u2010term sustainability of space. It provides knowledge about what is happening in space, and in particular Earth orbit. This knowledge provides understanding of potential threats (natural or human\u2010generated)\u2016 (Weeden 2014)\nSolving the orbital debris problem and increasing SSA are more efficiently addressed via cooperative\nefforts at the international scale. \u2015The removal of space debris is an environmental problem of global dimensions that must be assessed in an international context, including the UN.\u2016 (ESA Global Experts) In short, \u2015SSA is inherently international\u2016 (Weeden 2013).\n2 One or more open-access repositories for amateur observers can be formed. Such a publicly accessibly system should allow: amateur observers to enter their observations of orbital objects, and view the observations stored by others. Such a system could then share data with other parties."}, {"heading": "3. THE ORBITAL DEBRIS DATA PROBLEM", "text": "Given the premise that greater data sharing is needed to improve SSA and thereby improve space safety,\ntechnical (and political) obstacles to these objectives constitute what I will call the orbital debris (or SSA) data problem. The supposed problem involves the state of space object catalogs, databases, or information and knowledge systems that house debris and other SSA data. In what follows, \u2017information system\u2018 (IS) is used as a collective term for these systems. Political obstacles aside, there are at least two specific concerns, both of which apply to other data-intensive disciplines.\nThe first concern is a silo effect: distinct, essentially isolated, information systems. Individual IS\u2018s may (i)\nshare limited, if any, amounts of data, (ii) be inaccessible, and (iii) use different data formats, standards, terminologies, and classification schemes in spite of having a common universe of discourse. (iii) can be described as the problem of heterogeneous data and data formats, an obstacle to data-sharing and interoperability. Consider, for example, this statement expressed vis-\u00e0-vis in-orbit collision avoidance: \u2015Unfortunately, the most accurate tracking data for active satellites is often closely held only by the satellite operators.\u2016(Kelso and Gorski 2009)\nIn itself a data silo is not necessarily problematic. Depending on the purpose of the IS, it may be desirable\nat times. For remediating the orbital debris problem, however, silos are at least potentially problematic because resolving the former entails improving SSA, and \u2015[f]undamentally, SSA requires data sharing and cooperation between different actors\u2016 (Weeden 2013, emphasis added). The first concern, therefore, reflects a potential hindrance to improving the orbital debris situation. It is an indirect obstacle to ensuring safe and successful space navigation and development. At a more fundamental level, it should be easily accepted that sharing information (i.e. communication) is essential for research and scientific progress. It encourages hypothesis generation, knowledge discovery, collaboration, and division of labor.\nAs Kretzenbacher et al. (2012) suggest, the idea is to consolidate data for more complete coverage as well\nas update, if not replace, legacy systems (Weeden 2012). In sharing debris data, organizations with incomplete\u2014and they are all incomplete\u2014debris IS\u2018s will increase their knowledge of existing and potential space hazards. They will therefore have a more complete picture of the orbital environment and greater awareness toward: debris remediation, planetary defense, and assuring obstacle-free space exploration for generations to come.\nWe should move from situation A to either situation B or C (Figure 3), or some combination of the two. It\nis a move from incommunicative debris/SSA IS\u2018s to IS\u2018s sharing data with a neutral party (e.g. a consortium) formed for the creation of a joint international and dynamic master orbital debris (or SSA) catalog, and/or to interconnected and interoperable systems. In either situation, ontology may prove useful by explaining, classifying and annotating data, and serving as a partial means to interoperability. 3 The formation of a neutral party has been suggested in (Kretzenbacher et al. 2012), where we read:\n\u2015One possible approach is the creation of a neutral international organization and network that exists solely to facilitate the collection and sharing of SSA data. The proposed network would utilize the capabilities of already existing SSA infrastructure that are not restricted by being part of a defensive network.\u2016\nWeeden and Kelso (2009) also explore the idea of an international SSA system, where \u2015the primary goal of an international civil SSA system would be to support the safe and sustainable operation of all actors through provision of necessary information\u2016 (Space Safety & Sustainability Working Group 2012, p.2). Of course, \u2015any data sharing policy adapted by a comprehensive SSA system will need to balance privacy and security with data dissemination and openness\u2016 (Space Safety & Sustainability Working Group 2012, p.23).\n3 Interoperability, the problems thereof, and the role of ontologies, have been recently discussed in Thanos (2014).\nThe second concern vis-\u00e0-vis space object catelogs and other IS\u2018s is the sheer quantity of data that is (1)\nacquired from sensor networks, and (2) generated from astrodynamic conjunction analysis, propagation and prediction models. To take another data-intensive field as a case in point, we read: \u2015The progress of astronomy is about to hit a wall in terms of the processing, mining and interpretation of huge datasets.\u2016 (Valentijn and Kleijn 2006, p.20) The case for advancing astroinformatics (Borne 2009) is also a case for orbital debris and SSA informatics. The orbital debris (and data) problem is thereby also an opportunity to improve the state of space informatics.\nIn order to improve SSA via data-sharing, we may adopt one method used by informaticians: ontology\ndevelopment 4 . The next section begins with a brief overview of the field of ontology, followed by a sketch of a modularized ontological architecture for representing the orbital debris and broader SSA domain."}, {"heading": "4. INFORMATICS AND ONTOLOGICAL ENGINEERING FOR", "text": ""}, {"heading": "ORBITAL DEBRIS", "text": "Given the data-intensive nature of the orbital debris and space situational awareness domains, analyzing\nand communicating orbital debris datasets is necessary if we are to alleviate the orbital debris problem. The publication \u2015Future Human Spaceflight: The Need for International Cooperation\u2016 (Pace and Reibaldi 2010) acknowledges this when it cites two data-centric areas for international cooperation:\n1. \u2015Adoption of open, interoperable communications protocols (e.g., delay-tolerant networks) defined through the Consultative Committee on Space Data Standards.\u2016\n2. \u2015Adoption of standard orbit data message formats to facilitate exchange of satellite and orbital debris location information to avoid possible collisions in space.\u2016 (p.28)\n4 Note that I am primarily concerned with improving the orbital debris situation rather than advocating a particular method toward that goal. If ontological approaches prove to be insufficient or simply unhelpful, then there should be no quarrel with seeking alternatives.\n\u2015Astrodynamic standards are an important foundation for SSA\u2016 (Weeden 2012, p.23). Although the\nultimate utility of this research area is still to be determined, ontologies provide a formalized knowledge base of a given domain, and may foster semantic interoperability via annotation and classification of data elements housed within siloed information systems."}, {"heading": "4.1 ONTOLOGY FOR ORBITAL DEBRIS", "text": "Ontology or Ontological engineering (Staab and Studer 2009) in computer science is related to\nknowledge representation and informatics. The ontology development process involves domain research, concept analysis, a terminology/vocabulary, and the explicit specification of at least an understanding of the given domain of interest. The terms in the taxonomy, their definitions and the interrelationships between them (or that which the terms denote), are intended to express or capture the domain. This results in a logically formalized taxonomical structure that can be computationally reasoned over.\nOntology development is an ongoing iterative process that requires curation, quality-control, revision and\nupdating. This is particularly necessary for ontologies of the sciences, e.g., astronomy, where knowledge is updated and corrected, and where new discoveries are made over time. See Pinto and Martins (2004) for an account of the different stages of ontology building.\nA central focus in ontology development is the intended meaning of the specified vocabulary. Creating an\nontology involves the formation of the above-mentioned taxonomical structure. This hierarchical system of category and relation (predicate) terms has a formal semantics, the totality of which expresses some consensual knowledge of the domain. Some ontologies are essentially reference ontologies, that is, they present common and general knowledge of the given domain.\nFor computer tractability, a logical formalization of terms is employed using an implementation or\nknowledge representation language. This allows automated classification and inference, as well as querying. \u2015Ontologies have been developed to provide a machine-processable semantics of information sources that can be communicated between different agents (software and humans)\u2016 (Fensel 2004, p.3). An ontology provides this as a classification scheme of interrelated and axiomatized categories.\nIn employing the commonly adopted distinction of classes (categories, universals, types) and their\ninstances (individuals, particulars, tokens), a particular debris fragment is explicitly asserted to be an instance of the general class of Debris. The subclass (subtype, class subsumption) relation structures the class hierarchy. For example, the class, Orbital Debris is a subclass of (or simply Is a) Debris. The former inherits the properties of the latter. Domain-neutral ontological distinctions adopted from philosophical ontology are used to help make the ontology consistent, coherent and conceptually detailed. In qualitative spatial reasoning, for instance, mereological 5 concepts are employed. Taxonomies, themselves, can be structured along partonomic lines using a parthood relation, the formal properties of which are to be asserted in the ontology.\nOntologies are intended to minimize terminological ambiguity. This is achieved by providing a set of\ngeneral terms whose intended meanings are clearly and explicitly specified. In other words, terms are given explicit definitions that are comprehensible for the human user. If terms are left primitive (undefined within the ontology/system), then intuitions can provide their meaning, but some explicating description is best offered. Ontologies are minimally intended to clearly express what data is about and formally represent a shared understanding or conceptualization of a domain of interest.\nAlthough ontologies can be reused without being composed of modules, when they are modularized,\nreusability is another benefit. \u2015Ontologies were developed in Artificial Intelligence to facilitate knowledge sharing and reuse.\u2016 (Fensel 2004, p.3) Reusing existing category and relation terms from other ontologies, for instance, is\n5 The theory of parts and wholes.\noften considered desirable in ontology development. 6 Furthermore, annotating data elements (e.g. instance data) with ontological classes is a common task for achieving data interoperability. Axiomatized inference rules in conjunction with the generalized knowledge represented in the ontology are used to reason over that instance data.\nOntology engineering also involves conceptual and philosophical analysis, which should begin at the\noutset of the development process. At the most general or abstract levels, ontology development draws on ontological categories from philosophical inquiry. Examples include: Event, Object, Property, Relation, Process, State, and System. Common distinctions include: Object-Process, Object-Property, Independent-Dependent, and mereotopological concepts such as Part, Whole, and Connection. Formal ontological relations include Participation, Instantiation, Dependence, Parthood, Constitution, and Causality.\nDepending on the resources at hand and the desired degree of philosophical rigor, a complete metaphysical\naccount can be given for an ontology at all levels of generality/abstraction. For this communication I remain neutral with respect to how the above-mentioned general categories are philosophically characterized, while relying on our intuitions in the light of the scientific domain under analysis. I will, however, emphasize that the ultimate practical goals are to solve real-world problems. In this case, the overarching rationale is to contribute to spaceflight safety by improving peaceful space situational awareness via alleviating the orbital debris problem through ontology-based data sharing and integration."}, {"heading": "5. ONTOLOGY MODULES FOR ORBITAL DEBRIS", "text": "This section summarizes some relevant domain ontologies for an ontology of orbital debris and SSA. Each domain ontology\u2014 ontologies of a particular subject matter or universe of discourse\u2014should have: (i) category and relation terms, (ii) natural language definitions as well as a computable semantics, and (iii) a hierarchical structure."}, {"heading": "5.1 ODO: THE ORBITAL DEBRIS ONTOLOGY", "text": "The Orbital Debris Ontology, or ODO for short 7 , is the locus of the idea. It is an ontology of the domain\nor orbital debris, and as such represents the entities in, and general knowledge about, the orbital debris domain. There is one caveat. Rather than an orbital debris ontology in itself, an SSA ontology with orbital debris-relevant classes and relations may be formed instead. These classes would be portions of the SSA ontological class hierarchy.\nDesiderata for ODO, like other ontologies, include at least the following.\n(D1) TERMINOLOGY / VOCABULARY\nInclude category and relation terms specific to the domain of orbital debris. ODO will have terms for at least the following:\n Types of orbital debris\n Properties/features of debris\n Sensors observing the orbital environment\n Relations relating debris to other relevant entities\n Debris processes, including causes of debris formation  State and Positional information8 o Ephemeris data9 o Orbits and orbital properties\nFor example, if we follow the National Research Council (1995, p.21) and the United Nations (1999), then\ndebris types (classes) and property classes include the following (Table 2). Terms for some orbital properties\n6 I would, however, argue that this depends on not only the requirements, goals of (and problems solved by) the ontological system being developed, but whether the reused (or imported) classes accurately reflect the entities in the domain in question. 7 Pronounced: oh-dough 8 Mentioned in task 2 from section 4. 9 See: http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?glossary&term=ephemeris\ninclude: Eccentricity, Inclination, Right Ascension of the Ascending Node, and the other Keplerian Orbital Elements/Parameters.\nTable 3 lists some category and relation terms essential to an ontology of orbital debris, and to a broader\nspace situational awareness ontology. The domain-neutral object-process distinction reflected in the table can be formulated in various ways depending on the metaphysical accounts, but for the present communication it will be sufficient to rely on our intuitions of objects/things and processes/events. Material objects, such as satellites, are formally asserted to participate in processes, such as orbital plane changes.\n(D2) DEFINITIONS FOR TERMS AND A FORMAL SEMANTICS\n Natural Language (NL) Definitions that easily communicate the intended meaning to human users (comprehensibility).\n Formal and Computable Definitions First-order predicate logic, high-order or non-classical logics formalize definitions and domain knowledge.\nImplementation languages such as Common Logic Interchange Format (CLIF) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) are used for computability and information exchange. o Care must be taken so as not to engage in \u2015\u2017over-first-orderization\u2018, i.e., trying to axiomatize too much\u2016 (Menzel 2003, p.5) and not to give inadequate axiomatizations of terms and concepts that are\ndifficult to formalize. We must also be aware of the expressive limitations of each logic and ontology implementation language.\n Both sorts of definition should: be consistent (not self-contradictory) and convey necessary and/or sufficient conditions and identity criteria for each category of entity. Identity criteria include diachronic\n(identity across time: what makes something persist over time) and synchronic (identity at a time).\nWe naturally begin at the conceptual level, coming to an understanding of ideas, concepts and meanings.\nWe then move to formulate NL definitions that express the intended meaning and conceptualizations. To the extent that we have a good understanding of the domain, our conceptualizations ideally reflect the reality of the domain. Finally, although the logical and computable definition should ideally match the NL definition as closely as possible, any disparity should be explicitly stated (and explained) in documentation. This will help avoid misinterpretations and incorrect or false inferences. Definitional revisions may take place at any point in the ontology development process.\n10 Given that the class \u2017Space debris\u2018 can easily be interpreted as more general than \u2017orbital debris\u2018, I assert the latter as a type of the former. (NASA, 2008) does similarly.\n(D3) STRUCTURE THE TERMS, A HIERARCHICAL STRUCUTRE, A BACKBONE TAXONOMY\n Class terms should be formed into a taxonomic structure. The Is a class subsumption relation (classsubclass) is often used to structure taxonomies. This, in combination with any other relationships between\nclasses forms a hierarchical classification scheme that affords automated classification and inheritance of properties from parent to child classes.\n Ontology editors with graphical user interfaces, such as Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and TopBraid Composer, make this task relatively easy to achieve. Ontology visualization tools and plugins can also improve the ontology\ndevelopment process, and serve as helpful pedagogical tools for users.\nAchieving D1-D3 for ODO requires asking the following questions, which are part of the requisite domain\nresearch and conceptual development tasks. It is vital to consult domain literature and subject-matter/domain experts, particularly practicing domain experts, when conducting domain research and when checking the accuracy of the ontological representations, assertions, and inferences. This will help ensure high fidelity and veridicality in definitions and axiomatizations of domain knowledge. Domain experts include national space agencies such as the NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA); specific departments such as the Orbital Debris Program Office at NASA; as well as individual astrodynamicists, satellite operators, and so forth."}, {"heading": "Q1 How are orbital debris currently classified?

It provides one answer to the following question.\nQ5 What type of entity is orbital debris\u2014a Physical Object, Material Artifact, a Role, ...?\u2018\nOrbital debris may be characterized as types of Physical Object, i.e., spatio-temporally localized objects\nthat have some material properties. This is intuitive because the concept (and talk) of debris brings to mind material things. However, deeper ontological analysis yields another possibility. Debris may be modeled as a Role we attribute to physical objects in orbit, a role that is played or borne by the object relative to social conventions, processes and systems. One might justify this alternative characterization as follows.\nCommon definitions describe debris as being unusable or functionless. The object in question, however,\nmay have been functional in the past, or may have been part of a functional spacecraft. Some space objects in Earth orbit may also be reusable. As such, they cannot be described as orbital debris at all times. In other words, being orbital debris (or being usable/functional) is not an essential or rigid property of the object. Essential properties are those that are necessary at all times for the being the type in question. In this sense, one may wish to classify Orbital Debris as a role played by Physical or Material Objects in specific circumstances. Finally, and alternatively, do away with Roles and assign a socially-relative status or property to the orbiting object: functional, non-functional, usable, etc. Many, if not most, relevant terms in this domain belong to others. \u2017Planet\u2018 (or \u2017Planetary Body\u2018), for example, is not unique to the subject matter of orbital debris, but more accurately belongs to the discipline of astronomy. All the same a Planet class should be included when formalizing orbital knowledge of debris in orbit. Likewise for the Physical Properties of debris objects, i.e., mass, dimension, material composition, etc. Given that ODO will require terms from various disciplines it can be construed as an application ontology (but not necessarily\nso), i.e., an ontology created for a specific use or application. Application ontologies often use concepts from different domains and import terms (classes, relations) from other ontologies, including domain-specific or domainneutral reference ontologies. The application at hand is to foster data sharing among orbital debris and space object information systems to improve the state of orbital debris SSA toward ensuring spaceflight safety.\nODO can reuse classes from ontologies of these other disciplines, if the latter are accurately formalized.\nOther relevant domains include: astrodynamics (orbital mechanics/dynamics) and celestial mechanics, astronomy, and satellite operations. If domain-specific ontologies for these fields do not exist, then the appropriate domainspecific classes can be asserted and defined as needed. If terms from existing ontologies are insufficient, then at least two actions can be taken. One, send a suggested curation change (with explanation) to the ontology developers in question. Two, create the desired category terms from scratch and incorporate them in ODO.\nI will divide the relevant domain-specific ontologies in two groups and discuss them in the next section:\nScientific Domain Ontologies and Data (or Information Object) Ontologies. Although this presupposes a distinction between information objects (e.g., data) and what the data is supposedly about, explaining the distinction is beyond the scope of this paper."}, {"heading": "5.2 SCIENTIFIC DOMAIN/REFERENCE ONTOLOGIES FOR ODO", "text": "These ontologies capture general scientific knowledge, including physical laws/principles of nature, of the\nrespective discipline. Scientific domain ontologies act as reference ontologies or models expressing knowledge needed to annotate and ontologically describe instance data and ODO assertions. Given the overlap between, and the interconnectedness of, these disciplines, there will be a certain amount of prescription and arbitrariness regarding the boundaries, scope and content of each ontology. Thorough conceptual and philosophical analysis should be done for those concepts that resist placement, that are inherently vague, or that have multiple equally plausible ontological characterizations. The concept of Orbit may be an example. 11"}, {"heading": "ASTRONOMY ONTOLOGIES", "text": "One or more Astronomy ontologies should contain general terms for astronomical phenomena studied by astronomers. The most conspicuous astronomical entities relevant to ODO are natural celestial bodies, i.e., planets. A broader Space Situational Awareness Ontology (SSAO) will include classes for more astronomical entities, e.g., space weather phenomena, asteroids and comets, etc.\nExisting ontologies include the University of Maryland\u2018s (UMD) astronomical ontologies\n(Astronomy/Science Ontology), and the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) Ontology of Astronomical Object Types. Together, this suite of ontology files includes astronomical objects, scientific units, and so forth.\nDepending on the domain-neutral distinctions, an astronomy ontology can be divided into at least two\ninterconnected ontologies. For example, if we assume that astronomical phenomena can be classified according to an object-process distinction, then we can form an Astronomical Object Ontology and an Astronomical Process Ontology.\nThe IVOA astronomical ontology includes both object and process classes in their taxonomy. The former\nrepresents what are classified as astronomical objects, entities such as planets, moons, stars, and comets. These entities are what are often called celestial bodies (although I use the term \u2017celestial\u2018 to refer to non-human made bodies in space). The latter represents planetary and stellar processes, i.e. astronomical processes.\nUltimately whether the object-process distinction is sufficient to capture (truthfully represent) astronomical\nphenomena will depend on how it is specified, i.e. on the definitions of Object and Process classes. In general, it is not clear that all astronomical phenomena can, in fact, be faithfully categorized as either object or process in the traditional philosophical sense. A hybrid of the two classes, such that objects have processual properties and processes have object-like properties, might be in order for instance. From a philosophical perspective, cases can be made for various metaphysical characterizations, but this is an area for further discussion elsewhere. I would suggest that employing a richer ontological distinction, such as object-process-system may be helpful.\n11 At the time of this writing I have a philosophical and formal analysis of the category of Orbit in progress."}, {"heading": "CELESTIAL MECHANICS & ASTRODYNAMICS ONTOLOGIES", "text": "An Astrodynamics Ontology represents knowledge of astrodynamics, i.e., the motion of human-made objects in space. This is a primary focus for ODO because we are interested in the current and future orbital states (position, velocity, etc.) of debris. Candidate category terms include those for the Keplerian Orbital Elements/Parameters, spacecraft maneuvers, and the types of spacecraft orbits. Instance data includes data about particular maneuvers, and the particular orbital elements defining the orbits of individual spacecraft, debris objects and other space objects at one or more times.\nGiven the shared scientific foundations, astrodynamics is closely related to celestial mechanics. A Celestial\nMechanics Ontology\u2014to the extent it is distinct from an Astrodynamics Ontology\u2014is of the orbital motion of natural bodies in space. Due to the shared fundamentals, these two fields may be expressed in a single ontology.\nAlthough both classical and modern relativistic physics should be taken into account, whether both are in\nfact expressed in the ontologies may ultimately depend on the purpose of the system and the resources at hand. Classical physics is retained for its wide applicability, but the Relativistic physics must be included not only because it is more precise, but because successful satellite operations require it.\nCandidate classes for these ontologies include: Orbital Velocity, Orbital Pertubation, Astronomical\nCoordinate System, and Keplerian Orbital Element(s)/Parameter(s), which includes Inclination, Eccentricity, Right Ascension of the Ascending Node, and the other elements. Instances of these categories include specific velocities, and particular perturbing forces or processes affecting the motion and orbit of a spacecraft.\nToward a taxonomy of these disciplines, the category Space Dynamics, may subsume that of\nAstrodynamics and Celestial Dynamics. The latter two preserve the artificial-natural connotations while the former is added to be more general than either of the two.\nThe development of these scientific domain ontologies involves analyzing and ontologically representing\nthe data formats for encoding the orbital elements, formats such as the Two-line Element Set (TLE). We must determine whether classes for each orbital element are best placed within one of these ontologies, or in an information/data/measurement or geometric object ontology. Given the extensive use of physical-geometric concepts, a combination of terms representing physical phenomena, measurements and geometric constructs will be involved. This research topic provides interesting investigations into: the ontology of physical geometry; philosophy of space and time; the relationship between geometric/mathematical entities and physical phenomena; and the philosophy of science."}, {"heading": "5.3 DATA TYPE, INFORMATION & GEOMETRIC ENTITY ONTOLOGIES", "text": "Data/Information Ontologies and Geometric Ontologies represent the data types, standard units, data\nformats, information objects (or entity) and geometric objects. Coordinate systems, conceived as a geometric construct, are to be represented in these ontologies. Note that the concept of a data or information entity is not entirely clear and free of problems, but it will suffice to make the point. It is also unclear whether geometric entities are correctly classified as a type of these entities, types of abstracta, cognitive artifact, or otherwise.\nAgencies such as NASA and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are notable sources\nfor this knowledge. Formal representations of these sorts of entity exist as well. The IVOA and UMD ontologies, for example, have measurement and unit portions, and the NASA Semantic Web for Earth Environmental Terminology (SWEET) ontologies include a number of terms for units. Finally, the Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies (QUDT) also offer data type ontologies."}, {"heading": "ASTRODYNAMICS STANDARDS ONTOLOGY", "text": "An astrodynamics standards ontology should include standard formats for representing coordinate systems,\nand ephemeris data among other entities. The NORAD Two-Line Element Set (NASA TLE) is the most prominent standard format for defining an orbit. Orbital State Vectors, by contrast, is another format used to express the position of an object in orbit. The referents (if there are any) of each data element\u2014presumably the Keplerian Orbital Elements\u2014in the TLE should be determined. For example, Orbital Inclination as an angle between a reference plane (a geometric construction) and the orbital plane, is apparently an Angle (an information, mathematical or geometric entity). More generally, it may be characterized as a Relational Property. For SSA organizations with distinct formats for the same orbital elements, an ontology serves to provide common terminology annotating and classifying each common orbital parameter.\nTable 4 provides an example domain-specific category terms for the ontologies just discussed. For\ninformation on astrodynamic standards see Vallado (2001)."}, {"heading": "5.4 AN EXAMPLE DEBRIS SCENARIO", "text": "When identifying and tracking an object in space, data is gathered and extrapolated on a variety of features\nof the object and its motion, such as size, shape, attitude, velocity, direction, position. This applies to any space object in orbit: from operational satellites to orbital debris. The classical orbital parameters may be treated as properties of object\u2018s motion, its orbit, or the object itself, depending on further analysis. These Keplerian parameters describe the object\u2018s orbit, are determined at a time (an epoch), and propagated forward in time to yield a predicted orbital path. As such, this research presents a potential case study for investigating the relationship of predictive models/modeling to scientific inquiry and ontology.\nToward ontologically representing orbital scenarios, I will use the February 10, 2009 collision of the\nIridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 satellites (Orbital Debris Quarterly 2009) 12 as an example. Consider this arbitrary natural language expression describing the scenario. Far more is to be said for any orbital situation, but this will suffice to make the point.\nDebris fragment 1993-036BLP was formed by the collision of Irridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 satellites at time t. 1993-036BLP has a near circular orbit at an average altitude of 934 km, with Two-line Element set [E1,\u2026,E6] 13 for time t (epoch).\nThe expression refers to a particular Orbital Debris Object (1993-036BLP), a past Event (the collision),\nProperties of the debris orbit (and/or the debris itself), and Measurements. \u20171993-036BLP\u2018 is the international designator (name, label, etc.) denoting an individual debris fragment formed from the collision, but I do not include particular orbital parameters. Rather, I use \u2017[E1\u2026E6]\u2018 as a general placeholder to denote the specific TLE set expressing those six temporally-indexed parameters. The collision of the two satellites is represented by \u2017Coll-IC\u2018.\nTable 5 lists terms for individuals and undefined classes and relations for axiomatizing the scenario. More\nthan one possible predicate are included to express relations between debris and their genesis.\nIndividuals / Instances General Classes Relations\n12 See also: http://swfound.org/media/6575/swf_iridium_cosmos_collision_fact_sheet_updated_2012.pdf, and http://celestrak.com/events/collision/ 13 Each data element in the TLE can be decomposed into sub-parts as needed.\nBelow is a set of formal assertions using a common prefix notation to express the orbital scenario in a\ncomputable manner. The assertion \u2017is_an_instance_of(Earth, Planet)\u2018, for example, is read as \u2017Earth is an instance of Planet\u2018. Class terms are in bold, relation terms (predicates) are italicized, and instances are in plain text. Compare these with table 6, which presents the assertions in a subject-predicate-object form similar to the Resource Description Framework (RDF). Each row is read from left to right and expresses some specific fact of the orbital scenario. Although the formal assertions have only two arguments, n-ary predicates will be required for increased expressivity, i.e., to better capture the real-world scenarios and general knowledge of the orbital domain. For this reason, more expressive knowledge representation languages, such as CLIF, are preferable.\nis_an_instance_of (1993-036BLP, Orbital Debris Fragment) is_an_instance_of (coll-IC, Satellite Collision Event)\nhas_cause (1993-036BLP, coll-IC) has_formation_event (1993-036BLP, coll-IC)\norbits (1993-036BLP, Earth)\nhas_altitude (1993-036BLP, 934 km) has_label (1993-036BLP, \u20151993-036BLP\u2016) has_international_designator (1993-036BLP, \u20151993-036BLP\u2016)\nThe term for altitude, like other quantities, can be decomposed into a numerical value and a distance unit.\nFurthermore, if we wish to explicitly mention the orbit as a particular entity unto itself (albeit a relational one) with orbital properties, we may assert: has_orbit(1993-036BLP, O1). We can then describe O1 (the orbit of the debris) and its properties (the Classical Orbital Parameters) by relating it to some TLE set or Orbital State Vector. Each Orbital Parameter\u2014Inclination, Right Ascension of the Ascending Node, Eccentricity, etc.\u2014should have its own corresponding class term, instances of which reflect the orbital properties of some space object in orbit. TLE sets (or otherwise) include terms denoting the measured values of these parameters. If \u2017TLE-1\u2018 is asserted to refer to some specific TLE set of 1993-036BLP, we may then assert the following expressions:\nis_an_instance_of (O1, Orbit) is_described_by (O1, TLE-1)\nAnother possibility to model orbital characteristics is to describe the debris object as participating in an\norbiting process (or orbital/orbit process) that is described by a TLE set at a time, or that has specific orbital parameters as properties (at a time). However we represent these entities, ODO, or any space object or space situational awareness ontology, will require capturing general rules and knowledge about orbits. For any orbital\nobject (debris or otherwise), for example, the formal statement \u2017has_orbit (Orbital Debris Object, Orbit)\u2018, which expresses the idea that all debris objects have or are in some orbit, appears to hold true. In other words, if an object is an orbital debris object, then it is in orbit. Furthermore, all orbits have (or are described by) some orbital parameters (inclination, eccentricity, etc.). More specifically, if x is an instance of Orbit, then x has orbital parameter Inclination (and so on).\nThe instance data\u2014the particular values\u2014of the TLE for this debris fragment are to be annotated with their\ncorresponding class terms, e.g. Inclination, Eccentricity, Right Ascension of the Ascending Node, etc. Finally, some of the above relations may be ternary, rather than binary, where the third argument is a time instant or interval."}, {"heading": "6. AN ARCHITECTURE FOR AN ONTOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR", "text": ""}, {"heading": "ORBITAL DEBRIS", "text": "Figure 4 presents a unified ontological framework for the domain of orbital debris (or SSA more broadly).\nIt is also interpretable as portraying the scenarios from Figure 3. The green rectangular figure represents individual space object catalogs (orbital debris information systems) housing instance data about particular defunct satellites, spacecraft and other space objects considered as orbital debris. Instance data, which includes sensor data of actual space objects, should be annotated with ODO general categories to provide meaning and a formal semantics to the user and computational system, respectively. ODO (re)uses terms from scientific, engineering and data type (or information entity) ontologies (if they exist). Domain-specific ontologies may be subsumed by more general ontologies and a top-level ontology, the latter of which consists of domain-neutral categories and relations. This framework is offered as one possibility, subject to change, and makes no claims to completeness.\nIn summation, individual orbital debris (or SSA) object information and systems are to be interconnected or\notherwise share debris data toward a more exhaustive coverage of debris SSA. The application of ontologies may foster this by providing a common and formally specified orbital debris and space situational awareness terminology and knowledge base. Category terms from ODO may be a portion or subset of a broader SSA ontology. Terms from more general, yet domain-specific scientific and engineering disciplines, will be incorporated. In creating precise definitions of domain-specific terms and concepts, this research may contribute to the development of improved astrodynamic and SSA standards toward advancing the state of space development.\nToward implementation of this ontological architecture, the following suggestions are made. First, ontology\ndevelopment tools such as Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, or TopBraid Composer, will helpful in the process. I have, for instance, created an ODO/SSA ontology file using Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, adding essential orbital classes. Second, I suggest the implementation language be as expressible as possible. For this reason, at least full first-order knowledge representation languages are recommended. CLIF, for instance, is preferable to OWL despite the latter being more widespread. Finally, given the global nature of the real-world problem, this pursuit should have national space agencies as partners and participants, agencies such as the European Space Agency (ESA), NASA, and the Russian Federal Space Agency, among other burgeoning space agencies from around the world."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSION", "text": "By improving our situational awareness of the orbital environment, we are in a better position to resolve the\nthreat of space debris, and improve spaceflight safety. Given (i) the existence of disparate space situational awareness information systems from various space agencies, (ii) heterogeneous data and data formats, (iii) the gaps in orbital coverage, and therefore (iv) our limited knowledge of the orbital debris and broader space object population, orbital debris data sharing is intended to increase peaceful global SSA.\nToward these goals, I have presented an ontological architecture for the orbital debris domain and outlined\nsome requirements for an orbital debris ontology (ODO). The purpose of ODO (or a broader SSA ontology) is to represent general knowledge of, and the entities within, the orbital debris and SSA domain; offer a common orbital debris lexicon; and foster data-sharing among space debris/object catalogs and SSA information systems. Further work includes: additional domain research; conceptual and philosophical analysis of orbital and astrodynamic concepts; an ontological description of the Two-line Element set; a first- or higher-order formalization of the relevant classes, and a computable specification.\nMore generally, I hope this paper has presented ideas for advancing and improving space situational\nawareness via space data exchange, integration, and the ontology engineering for astronautics."}, {"heading": "European Space Agency. \u2015Global Experts Agree Action Needed On Space Debris\u2016", "text": "URL=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Debris/Global_experts_agree_action_needed_on_space_ debris (Accessed Nov 24, 2014)\nEuropean Space Agency. \u2015Space Debris \u2013 About\u2016 URL= http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Debris/About_space_debris (Accessed Nov 24, 2014)\n___ \u2015Space Object Catalog\u2016 URL= http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2013/04/Object_catalogue (Accessed Nov 24, 2014)\n___ \u2015Space Surveillance and Tracking \u2013 SST Segment\u2016 (ESA SST) URL= http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/Space_Surveillance_and_Tracking__SST_Segment\nFensel D.

Achieving these goals requires sharing orbital debris and other SSA data. Toward this, I present an ontological architecture for the orbital debris domain, taking steps in the creation of an orbital debris ontology (ODO). The purpose of this ontological system is to (I) represent general orbital debris and SSA domain knowledge, (II) structure, and standardize where needed, orbital data and terminology, and (III) foster semantic interoperability and data-sharing. In doing so I hope to (IV) contribute to solving the orbital debris problem, improving peaceful global SSA, and ensuring safe space travel for future generations.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2010"}}}
