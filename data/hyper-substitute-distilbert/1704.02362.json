However, applause, as the most direct audience reaction, has till now not been fully investigated and understood. The audience do not just clap whenever they like, they do so only at certain points and are continuously looking for appropriate times when applause can possibly occur (Kuo, 2001).

These identified factors are later used to build machine learning models that can automatically identify applause-evoking segments."}, {"heading": "Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Data Collection", "text": "To address our research questions, we write a script to collect 2,135 TED talk videos from 2006 June to 2016 September. We choose TED talks as the dataset of this study because TED talks are widely used as a good source for learning presentation skills across different domains. In addition, for each TED talk there is a spell-checked transcript. Incidences of applause were marked on each transcript in the format of \u201c(Applause)\u201d. Relying on the marked applauses, we segment each talk into several chunks, each associate with one incidence of applause. We\ndelete all end-of-speech applause from the transcripts, given that no matter what the speaker says, the audiences will always applause to be polite at the very end. These deletions leave us with 904 talks, comprised of 3,178 times of total applauses."}, {"heading": "Hypothesized Rhetorical Devices", "text": "To answer our RQ1, in this study we propose hypothesized rhetorical devices from 7 different perspectives derived from both theories and observation. Linguistic Style \u2013 We rely on LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2001) to capture language used by speakers to evoke applause. We exclude words from the \u201cAffective or Emotional Processes\u201d sub-category (reasons will be discussed below). We assume the linguistic styles learnt from LIWC (e.g. personal pronouns, achievement, insight) will cover rhetorical devices such as references, and pursuit, etc. Emotional Expression \u2013 Speakers can sway the audiences by rousing emotions in their presentations (Petty et al., 2003). We rely on the NRC Emotion Lexicon (Mohammad et al., 2013) for identification of emotion expressions in this study, as it demonstrated more power in emotion detection than LIWC (Brooks et al., 2013). We count the number of words from each of the categories, then normalize them by the total number of words in the sentence. Phonetic Structure \u2013 in this work we investigate three phonetic structures: alliteration, rhyme, and homogeneity (\u00d6zbal et al., 2013). All three structure are extracted based on the phonetic representation of English words using the CMU pronouncing dictionary (Weide, 1998). Specifically, for alliteration score, we count the number of repeated prefixes appeared in a sentence and normalized by the number of total phonemes. Rhyme score is computed as the ratio of the number of repeated suffix to the total number of phonemes. Rhythmical homogeneity is measured as the ratio of the count of distinct phonemes to the total count of phonemes. We assume that rhetoric devices, such as or sloganlike wordings (e.g. I came, I saw, I conquered) can be well covered by the three phonetic structures. Projection of Names \u2013 to test the effectiveness of nameprojecting (Atkinson, 1984), we extract all individuals mentioned by matching with names used in Social Security card applications after 18791. Gratitude Expression \u2013 gratitude expressions are extracted using a self-defined list of words, including grateful*, gratitud*, thank*, appreciate*, and bless*, etc. Rhetorical Questions \u2013 we simply use question mark as the indicator of questions, as suggested by Li et al. (2011). Applause-seeking Expression \u2013 Speakers sometimes ask for applause explicitly (e.g. \u201clet\u2019s give him an applause\u201d). Applause-seeking expressions are extracted by matching the pattern \u201capplau*\u201d. We use the presence of names, grati-\n1 https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-socialsecurity-card-applications-national-level-data\ntude expressions, rhetorical questions, and applauseseeking expressions as binary features in this work."}, {"heading": "Modeling Approach", "text": "For RQ1, we use logistic regression to examine the associations between the 78 hypothesized rhetorical devices and the evoked applauses. We use the one sentence right before the applause as positive example, since before answering RQ2, we treat the last sentence in front of an applause as its trigger2. For negative examples we randomly selected the same number of sentences from the beginning of each applause-segmented chunk. This yields a dataset containing 6,356 records. We conduct a Lasso penalized logistic regression using R glmnet implementation, to control for multicollinearity among predictors. Optimal lambda is determined using 10-fold cross validation.\nFor RQ2, we build binary classification models to differentiate applause-evoking segments from non-applauseevoking ones using the hypothesized rhetorical devices. We implement the classifiers using different learning algorithms provided in Weka: C4.5, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM. We use the default values in Weka for all learning parameters with 10-fold cross-validation.\nSo far, all of our analyses are conducted on a single sentence level, this leads us to question if the decision to applaud is only based on what the audience last heard. We wonder if involving more sentences into our applause prediction model would increase its accuracy. To do so, we repeat the classification tasks by increasing the number of sentences before/after an applause. We compare the performances of different models to find the optimal position for the usage of the proposed rhetorical devices."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": ""}, {"heading": "RQ1: Effective Rhetorical Devices Identification", "text": "Table 1 shows the standardized regression coefficient between the hypothesized rhetorical devices and the evoked applause. Here the standardized regression coefficients were calculated through Lasso penalized logistic regression. Significant level for each non-zero coefficient was measured separately and then corrected with False Discovery Rate. Due to the space limit, we only showed the 24 significant rhetorical devices in Table 1.\nFirst, regarding its linguistic styles, we found that sentences with more personal pronouns, either self- (e.g. I, my) or audience-referencing (e.g. you, yours) are more likely to receive applause. Self-referencing can increase the persuasiveness of a speech (Hogan, 2010), whereas audience-referencing can make the listeners feel known and named. Second, applause evoked sentences tend to contain\n2 We also applied the same approach to varied number of sentences before the applause and the results were consistent. So here we only reported the results based on one sentence.\nmore numbers, certainty (e.g. always, never), and logical expressions (e.g. inclusion and exclusion, such as include, but). All these expressions can make the speakers sound more authoritative and can reinforce his / her statement through voices of expertise (Reyes, 2011). Third, applauseevoking sentences talks more about present than past. Fourth, audiences tend to engage less when the speakers talk about insights (e.g. analyze, conclude) and inhibitions (e.g. barrier, constrain), but applause more when speakers become less formal (when mention e.g. friend, buddy). Additional associations in the usage of fillers (e.g. you know, I mean) and assents (e,g, yes, ok) suggest that speech disfluency negatively affects audience engagement.\nIn terms of the usage of emotional expressions and rhymes, we noticed that applause-evoking sentences tend to express less anger and are more rhythmic. Sentences such as \u201c those are the people I know, those are my friends and family, that is the majority of our society, that is you, that is me\u201d tend to make the whole presentation more powerful and exciting.\nConsistent with previous studies on applause generation, our results also indicated that applause will be evoked when the speaker calls for a person\u2019s name (e.g. I want to introduce the creators, Alex and Daniel) or expressing thanks or gratitude to the audience or others (e.g. I would like to thank you for listening). However, contrast to previous findings, our results shows a negative association between applause generation and the adaptation of rhetorical questions.\nTo examine the goodness of fit for the hypothesized rhetorical devices, we further calculated their prediction strength through R2, as well as the correlation coefficient between the predicted values and the true values. Overall, the model with all hypothesized rhetorical devices explained 23% of the variance. Given that there are many other factors, such as speaker\u2019s presentation skills, speaking performance, etc., that could also affect the applause\ngeneration process, without including any of those determinant, we believed a R2 value of 0.23 for our proposed model is reasonable. The correlation coefficient between the predicted values and the true values is 0.480, which is also quite moderate.\nTo further understand the phenomenon of applause generation, we next measured the relative importance of each predictor in our model. We calculated the weight for each significant rhetorical device by normalizing the absolute value of \u03b2 over the sum of all absolute \u03b2s (Gilbert and Karahalios, 2009). We plotted the relative importance of each individual rhetorical device in Figure 1. As can be seen from the Figure, the usage of gratitude expressions had the dominant influences in predicting applause generation, followed by the speaker\u2019s reference to the present, as well as the adoption of the rhythmic words."}, {"heading": "RQ2: Applause Prediction", "text": "In Table 2, we showed the classification results for each subset of the rhetorical devices. Due to space limit, we only reported the results from logistic regression as it achieved the best performance. Overall, with all the hypothesized rhetorical devices, our model received a classification accuracy of 71.9%, which is significantly higher than the 50% majority-voted baseline. In terms of each individual feature set, we noticed that consistent with the results of our regression analysis in RQ1, the subset of\nappreciation and gratitude expressions demonstrated the highest discriminative power. Linguistic styles, emotion expressions, phonetic structure, and applause-seeking expressions are also related to applause elicitation. However, rhetorical features including projection of names and usage of rhetorical questions are not enough by themselves in predicting the incidences of audience applause.\nNext, we tested to see if involving more sentences into our prediction model could increase its accuracy. The median number of sentences contained in each applausesegmented chunk is 24. So we decided to try from only one last sentence before the applause to in total six sentences before the applause (last \u00bc of the segmented chunk). We plotted in Figure 2 the classification performance of the hypothesized rhetorical devices along the number of sentences selected. As can be seen from Figure 2, the classification accuracy decreased continuously as the number of sentence involved increased. In other words, hearing one sentence is enough to tell if the audience is going to applaud or not. This result also proved the validity of the regression analysis as we conducted in answering RQ1."}, {"heading": "Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "This work pays attention to an important but less emphasized social-psychological problem of applause elicitation. We proposed hypothesized rhetorical devices from seven perspectives for applause generation during public discourses. Through regression analysis, we found 24 rhetorical devices significantly associated with the applause generation process and built a model to predict it. We believe that our work is quite unique and important, as we are the first study to understand the rhetorical devices for applause generation at a relatively large scale using quantitative methods. These findings can help system designers to better design tools to assist speakers in generating more engageable speeches. For example, our proposed model can notify the speakers if the audience will applaud as expected at certain point of their speech. Besides, our findings, such as \u201cavoid angry expressions\u201d, and \u201cbe more prospective,\nless retrospective\u201d, can be used as valuable insights for speakers when preparing their speech. At last, this study is of significant value to social-psychological researchers and can be used as a stepping point for future conversation analysis. A limitation of this study is that it analyzed only English speeches from one platform. However, considering the varied topics covered by TED talks, we believe our results can be also generalized to other platforms. Indeed, for future work, we will evaluate our model on other datasets and other languages for generalizability tests. We are also going to analyze applause with different degrees (only partial audiences applaud) to better understand the effect of the rhetorical devices on applause elicitation under the principle of social proof."}], "references": [{"title": "Public speaking and audience responses: Some techniques for inviting applause", "author": ["J.M.
