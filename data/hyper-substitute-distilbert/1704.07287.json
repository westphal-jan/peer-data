Speech poses challenges for parsing. First, transcripts may contain errors and lack punctuation. Joint speech recognition and parsing is useful for dealing with word errors and sentence segmentation (Kahn and Ostendorf, 2012). Second, even perfect transcripts can be difficult to handle because of disfluencies (restarts, repetitions, and self-corrections), filled pauses (\u201cum\u201d, \u201cuh\u201d), interjections (\u201clike\u201d), parentheticals (\u201cyou know\u201d, \u201cI mean\u201d), and sentence fragments that are common\n\u2217Equal Contribution.\nin spontaneous speech. Some of these phenomena can be handled in standard grammars. Disfluencies typically require extensions of the model, and different approaches have been explored in both constituent parsing (Charniak and Johnson, 2001; Johnson and Charniak, 2004) and dependency parsing (Rasooli and Tetreault, 2013; Honnibal and Johnson, 2014).\nIn addition to these challenges, speech also carries helpful extra information \u2013 beyond the words \u2013 associated with the prosodic structure of an utterance and encoded via variation in timing and intonation. Studies show that speakers pause in locations that are correlated with syntactic structure (Grosjean et al., 1979), and listeners are able to use prosodic structure in resolving syntactic ambiguities (Price et al., 1991). Prosodic cues also signal disfluencies by marking the interruption point (Shriberg, 1994). However, most speech parsing systems in practice take little advantage of these cues. This study focuses on this last challenge, aiming to incorporate prosodic cues in a state-of-the-art neural parser.\nResearchers have explored a number of approaches for incorporating prosody in parsing. A challenge of using prosodic features is that multiple acoustic cues interact to signal prosodic structure, including pauses, duration lengthening, fundamental frequency modulation, and even spectral shape. These cues also vary with the phonetic segment, emphasis, emotion and speaker, so feature extraction has typically involved experimenting with multiple different time windows and normalization techniques. Researchers have dealt with this by explicitly predicting prosodic structure. The work proposed here takes advantage of advances in neural networks to automatically learn a good feature representation for parsing without the need for ar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n07 28\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n4 A\npr 2\n01 7\nexplicitly representing prosodic constituents. To narrow the scope of this work and facilitate error analysis, our experiments use hand transcripts and known sentence segmentation.\nOur work offers the following contributions: We present a neural encoder-decoder model for parsing conversational speech that provides a framework for directly integrating acoustic-prosodic features with text; we demonstrate that significant improvements in parsing performance are obtained without requiring hand-annotated prosodic structure; and we provide analyses that show that combining multiple types of prosodic cues lead to gains for specific types of ambiguities."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Related work on parsing conversational speech has mainly addressed two problems: i) handling disfluencies and ii) integrating prosodic cues.\nOne major challenge of parsing conversational speech is the presence of disfluencies, which are grammatical (and prosodic) interruptions. Disfluencies include repetitions (\u2018I am + I am\u2019), repairs (\u2018I am + we are\u2019), and restarts (\u2018What I + Today is the...\u2019), where the \u2018+\u2019 corresponds to an interruption point. Repairs often involve parallel grammatical constructions, but they can be more complex, involving hedging, clarifications, etc. One solution for handling dislfuencies is to first automatically detect them, remove the edited words (reparandum), and then parse the cleaned-up text. Disfluency detection is an active area of research (Georgila, 2009; Qian and Liu, 2013; Ferguson et al., 2015; Zayats et al., 2015, 2016). While disfluency detection has improved greatly, it still does not achieve high accuracy for a broad range of tasks, so researchers have emphasized joint parsing and disfluency detection. Such models have been explored for syntactic constituents (Charniak and Johnson, 2001; Kahn et al., 2005), or dependencies (Rasooli and Tetreault, 2013; Honnibal and Johnson, 2014).\nResearchers have been exploring different approaches to incorporating prosody in parsing since the 1990s. One study used quantized acousticprosodic cues as tokens in parsing, similar to punctuation, and observed a degradation in performance (Gregory et al., 2004). They hypothesize that these tokens are problematic because they break n-gram dependencies. Because multiple prosodic cues interact to signal prosodic structure, most studies have leveraged symbolic prosodic boundary mark-\ners (prosodic breaks) based on the ToBI prosodic annotation system (Silverman et al., 1992). In some studies, automatically predicted prosodic breaks are incorporated directly (Hale et al., 2006; Dreyer and Shafran, 2007; Huang and Harper, 2010). Another study uses prosodic break posteriors in parsing (Kahn et al., 2005). In either case, the use of symbolic prosodic breaks requires availability of a hand-annotated corpus for training break detection models. In addition, the parsing approaches that are most successful in using prosody leverage N - best hypothesis rescoring, limiting the impact of prosodic features to a small number of hypotheses.\nRecently, attention-enabled encoder-decoder models (Bahdanau et al., 2015) have gained traction for constituency parsing, with Vinyals et al. (2015) achieving state-of-the-art results for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus using an ensemble. Performance has since been improved by another ensemble of encoder-decoder models trained in a multi-task setting (Luong et al., 2016). Our models are based on this attention-based approach."}, {"heading": "3 Task and Model Description", "text": "We next describe our encoder-attention-decoder model that maps a sequence of word-level input features to a linearized parse output sequence.

The transcriptions are preprocessed by removing punctuation and lower-casing all text to better mimic the speech recognition setting. Following Vinyals et al. (2015), the parse trees are linearized, with pre-terminals also normalized as \u201cXX\u201d. Figure 1 illustrates how we convert standard treebank parses into encoder inputs and gold standard linearized parses."}, {"heading": "3.2 Encoder-Attention-Decoder Parser", "text": "Our attention-based encoder-decoder model is similar to the one used by Vinyals et al. (2015). The encoder is a deep long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) that reads in a wordlevel input feature sequence1, represented as a sequence of vectors x = (x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,xTs) and outputs high-level features h = (h1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,hTs) where hi = LSTM(xi,hi\u22121).2\nThe parse decoder is also a deep LSTM-RNN that predicts the linearized parse sequence y =\n1As in Vinyals et al. (2015), the input sequence is processed in reverse order, as shown in Figure 2.\n2For brevity we omit the LSTM equations. The details can be found, e.g., in Zaremba et al. (2014).\n(y1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , yTo) as follows:\nP (y|x) = To\u220f t=1 P (yt|h,y<t)\nIn attention-based models, the posterior distribution of the output yt at time step t is given by:\nP (yt|h,y<t) = softmax(W s[ct;dt] + bs),\nwhere vector bs and matrix W s are learnable parameters; ct is referred to as a context vector that summarizes the encoder\u2019s output h; and dt is the decoder hidden state at time step t, which captures the previous output sequence context y<t.\nThe attention mechanism used by Vinyals et al. (2015) computes the context vector ct as follows:\nuit = v > tanh(W 1hi +W 2dt + ba)\n\u03b1t = softmax(ut)\nct = Ts\u2211 i=1 \u03b1tihi\nwhere vectors v, ba and matrices W 1, W 2 are learnable parameters; ut and \u03b1t are the attention score and attention weight vector, respectively, for decoder time step t.\nThe above attention mechanism is only contentbased, i.e., it is only dependent on hi, dt. It is not location-aware, i.e., it does not consider the \u201clocation\u201d of the previous attention vector. For parsing conversational text, location awareness can be crucial since disfluent structures can have duplicate words/phrases that may \u201cconfuse\u201d the attention mechanism.3\nIn order to make the model location-aware, the attention mechanism takes into account the previous attention weight vector \u03b1t\u22121. In particular, we use the attention mechanism proposed by Chorowski et al. (2015), in which \u03b1t\u22121 is represented via a feature vector:\nf t = F \u2217\u03b1t\u22121 where F \u2208 Rk\u00d7r represents k learnable convolution filters of width r. The filters are used for performing 1-D convolution over \u03b1t\u22121 to extract k features f ti for each time step i of the input sequence. The extracted features are then incorporated in the alignment score calculation as:\nuit = v > tanh(W 1hi +W 2dt +W ff ti + ba)\n3This phenomenon has been observed in encoder-decoder models for speech recognition (Chorowski et al., 2014).\nwhereW f is another learnable parameter matrix. Finally, the decoder hidden state dt is computed as: dt = LSTM([y\u0303t\u22121; ct\u22121],dt\u22121)\nwhere y\u0303t\u22121 is the embedding vector corresponding to the previous output symbol yt\u22121."}, {"heading": "3.3 Acoustic-Prosodic Features", "text": "In previous work using encoder-decoder models for parsing (Vinyals et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2016), vector xi is simply the word embedding ei of the word at position i of the input sentence. For parsing conversational speech, we can also use acoustic prosodic features. Here we explore four types of features widely used in computational models of prosody: pauses, duration lengthening, fundamental frequency and energy. Since the features are different in nature (word-level measurements vs. time series), they are integrated with the encoderdecoder using different mechanisms.\nAll features are extracted from transcriptions that are time-aligned at the word level. In a small number of cases, the time alignment for a particular word boundary is missing, mainly due to tokenization. For example, contractions, such as don\u2019t in the original transcript, are labeled as separated words, do and n\u2019t, for the parser and the internal word boundary time is missing. In many cases, these internal times are estimated, but in a few cases estimation was difficult. For the roughly 1% of sentences where time alignments are missing, we simply backoff to the text-based parser.\nThe pause feature vector pi for word i is the concatenation of pre-word pause feature ppre,i and\npost-word pause feature ppost,i, where each subvector is a learned embedding for 6 pause categories: off (no pause), not-available, 0 < p \u2264 0.05 s, 0.05 s < p \u2264 0.2 s, 0.2 < p \u2264 1 s, and p > 1 s. This bucketing scheme for pause duration is motivated by the distribution of pause durations in our data and the assumption that longer pause length differences are not useful.\nWord-final duration lengthening is a strong cue to prosodic phrase boundaries (Wightman et al., 1992). The word duration feature \u03b4i is a realvalued scalar, equal to the actual word duration divided by the mean duration of the word, clipped to a maximum value of 5. The sample mean is used for frequent words (count \u2265 15). For infrequent words we estimate the mean as the sum over the sample means for the phonemes in the word\u2019s dictionary pronunciation.\nFor fundamental frequency (f0) and energy (E) contours, we use a CNN to automatically learn a mapping from the time series to a word-level vector. The contour features are extracted with 25-ms frames with 10-ms hops using Kaldi (Povey et al., 2011), motivated by the success of the associated f0 features in speech recognition (Ghahremani et al., 2014). Three f0 features are used: warped Normalized Cross Correlation Function (NCCF), logpitch with Probability of Voicing (POV)-weighted mean subtraction over a 1.5-second window, and the estimated derivative (delta) of the raw log pitch. Three energy features are extracted from the Kaldi 40-mel-frequency filter bank features: Etotal, the log of total energy normalized by dividing by the speaker side\u2019s max total energy; Elow, the log of\ntotal energy in the lower 20 mel-frequency bands, normalized by total energy, and Ehigh, the log of total energy in the higher 20 mel-frequency bands, normalized by total energy. Multi-band energy features are used as a simple mechanism to capture articulatory strengthening at prosodic constituent onsets (Fourgeron and Keating, 1997).\nFigure 3 summarizes the feature learning approach. The f0 and E features are processed at the word level: each sequence of frames corresponding to a word (and potentially its surrounding context) is convolved with N filters of m sizes (a total of mN filters). The motivation for the multiple filter sizes is to enable the computation of features that capture information on different time scales. For each filter, we perform a 1-D convolution over the 6-dimensional f0/E features with a stride of 1. Each filter output is max-pooled, resulting in mN -dimensional speech features si.\nOur overall acoustic-prosodic feature vector is the concatenation of pi, \u03b4i, and si in various combinations."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.1 Dataset", "text": "Our core corpus is Switchboard-NXT (Calhoun et al., 2010), a subset of the Switchboard corpus (Godfrey and Holliman, 1993). Switchboard I \u2013 Release 2 (Godfrey and Holliman, 1993) is a collection of about 2,400 telephone conversations between strangers; 650 such conversations were later hand-annotated with syntactic parses as part of the Penn Treebank Release 3 dataset (Marcus et al., 1999), and 642 of these were further augmented with richer layers of annotation facilitated by the NITE XML toolkit (Calhoun et al., 2010). Our sentence segmentations and syntactic trees are based on the annotations from the Treebank 3 set, with a few manual corrections from the NXT release. This core dataset consists of 100K sentences, totaling 1M tokens forming a vocabulary of 13.5K words.

For this reason, previous work has often explicitly detected EDIT regions in conjunction with parsing or as a preprocessing step.\nIn our context, we are not addressing the disfluency detection problem. Therefore, besides the fact that we are using a larger training data set, our results are not comparable with those of previous work on Switchboard constituent parsing, which involved removing and re-inserting EDIT nodes during evaluation according to a set of rules (Charniak and Johnson, 2001; Kahn et al., 2005). Nevertheless, acknowledging the fact that we are evaluating parsing of transcribed speech, we also report flattened-edit parseval F1 scores (\u201cflat-F1\u201d), which is parseval computed on trees with \u201cflattened\u201d edit nodes, where the structure under edit nodes has been eliminated so that all leaves are immediate children."}, {"heading": "4.3 Model Parameters and Training Details", "text": "Both the encoder and decoder are 3-layer deep LSTM-RNNs with 256 hidden units in each layer.

These filter size combinations are motivated by the fact that the average word length in our dataset is 25 frames, so intuitively the different filter sizes are capturing f0 and energy phenomena on various levels: w = 5, 10 for sub-word, w = 25 for word, and w = 50 for word and context.\nFor optimization we use Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a minibatch size of 64. The initial learning rate is 0.001 which is decayed by a factor of 0.9 whenever training loss, calculated after every 500 updates, degrades w.r.t. to the worst of its previous 3 values.

We experiment with the content-only attention model used by Vinyals et al. (2015) and the content+location attention model proposed by Chorowski et al. (2015). For comparison with previous non-neural models, we use a high-quality latent-variable parser, the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006), retrained on our Switchboard data. Table 2 compares the three text-only models. In terms of F1, the content+location attention beats the Berkeley parser by about 2.5% and content-only attention by about 4.5%. Interestingly, flat-F1 scores for both encoderdecoder models is lower than their corresponding F1 scores. This suggests that the encoder-decoder models do well on predicting the internal structure of EDIT nodes. The reverse is true for the Berkeley parser: Flattening the EDIT nodes results in a better score.\nTo explain the gains of content+location attention over content-only attention, we compare their scores on fluent (without EDIT nodes) and disfluent sentences, shown in Table 3. From the table, it is clear that most of the gains for content+location attention are from disfluent sentences. The reason may be that disfluent sentences can have duplicate words or phrases, which can be problematic for a content-only attention model. Since our best model is the content+location attention model, we will henceforth refer to it as our \u201ctext-only\u201d model.\n8In rare cases (and virtually none as our models converge), the decoder does not generate a valid parse sequence, due to the mismatch in brackets and/or the mismatch in the number of pre-terminals and terminals, i.e., num(XX) 6= num(tokens). In such cases, we simply add/remove brackets from either end of the parse, or add/remove pre-terminal symbols XX in the middle of the parse to match the number of input tokens."}, {"heading": "5.2 Adding Acoustic-Prosodic Features", "text": "We extend our text-only model with the three kinds of acoustic-prosodic features: pause (p), word duration (\u03b4), and CNN mappings of fundamental frequency (f0) and energy (E) features (f0/E-CNN).\nThere are 23 \u2212 1 = 7 model configurations corresponding to the possible combinations of the acoustic-prosodic features.

The acoustic-prosodic features provide the largest gains when sentences are disfluent or long, and analysis of error types shows that these features are especially helpful in repairing attachment errors. Further analysis may be helpful for revealing more specific contrasts, understanding how fine-grained duration would impact the findings, and discovering which aspects of prosody are learned by the CNN.

For automatically parsing a spoken utterance, we introduce a model that integrates transcribed text and acoustic-prosodic features using a convolutional neural network over energy and pitch trajectories coupled with an attention-based recurrent neural network that accepts text and word-based prosodic features. We find that different types of acoustic-prosodic features are individually helpful, and together improve parse F1 scores significantly over a strong text-only baseline. For this study with known sentence boundaries, error analysis shows that the main benefit of acoustic-prosodic features is in sentences with disfluencies and that attachment errors are most improved.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
