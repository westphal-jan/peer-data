However, their application to parsing and generating text using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) has been limited, due to the relatively limited amount of labeled data and the nonsequential nature of the AMR graphs. We present a novel training procedure that can lift this limitation using millions of unlabeled sentences and careful preprocessing of the AMR graphs. For AMR parsing, our model achieves competitive results of 62.1 SMATCH, the current best score reported without significant use of external semantic resources. For AMR generation, our model establishes a new state-of-the-art performance of BLEU 33.8. We present extensive ablative and qualitative analysis including strong evidence that sequencebased AMR models are robust against ordering variations of graph-to-sequence conversions."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism to encode the meaning of natural language text. As shown in Figure 1, AMR represents the meaning using a directed graph while abstracting away the surface forms in text. AMR has been used as an intermediate meaning representation for several applications including machine translation (MT) (Jones et al., 2012), summarization (Liu et al., 2015), sentence compression (Takase et al., 2016), and event extraction (Huang et al., 2016). While AMR allows for rich semantic representation, annotating training data in AMR is expensive, which in turn limits the use\nObama was elected and his voters celebrated\nof neural network models (Misra and Artzi, 2016; Peng et al., 2017; Barzdins and Gosko, 2016).\nIn this work, we present the first successful sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models that achieve strong results for both text-to-AMR parsing and AMR-to-text generation. Seq2seq models have been broadly successful in many other applications (Wu et al., 2016; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Vinyals et al., 2015). However, their application to AMR has been limited, in part because effective linearization (encoding graphs as linear sequences) and data sparsity were thought to pose significant challenges. We show that these challenges can be easily overcome, by demonstrating that seq2seq models can be trained using any graph-isomorphic linearization and that unlabeled text can be used to significantly reduce sparsity.\nOur approach is two-fold. First, we introduce a novel paired training procedure that enhances both the text-to-AMR parser and AMR-to-text generator. More concretely, first we use self-training to\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n08 38\n1v 3\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n8 A\nug 2\n01 7\nbootstrap a high quality AMR parser from millions of unlabeled Gigaword sentences (Napoles et al., 2012) and then use the automatically parsed AMR graphs to pre-train an AMR generator. This paired training allows both the parser and generator to learn high quality representations of fluent English text from millions of weakly labeled examples, that are then fine-tuned using human annotated AMR data.\nSecond, we propose a preprocessing procedure for the AMR graphs, which includes anonymizing entities and dates, grouping entity categories, and encoding nesting information in concise ways, as illustrated in Figure 2(d). This preprocessing procedure helps overcoming the data sparsity while also substantially reducing the complexity of the AMR graphs. Under such a representation, we show that any depth first traversal of the AMR is an effective linearization, and it is even possible to use a different random order for each example.\nExperiments on the LDC2015E86 AMR corpus (SemEval-2016 Task 8) demonstrate the effectiveness of the overall approach. For parsing, we are able to obtain competitive performance of 62.1 SMATCH without using any external annotated examples other than the output of a NER system, an improvement of over 10 points relative to neural models with a comparable setup. For generation, we substantially outperform previous best results, establishing a new state of the art of 33.8 BLEU. We also provide extensive ablative and qualitative analysis, quantifying the contributions that come from preprocessing and the paired training procedure."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Alignment-based Parsing Flanigan et al. (2014) (JAMR) pipeline concept and relation identification with a graph-based algorithm. Zhou et al. (2016) extend JAMR by performing the concept and relation identification tasks jointly with an incremental model. Both systems rely on features based on a set of alignments produced using bi-lexical cues and hand-written rules. In contrast, our models train directly on parallel corpora, and make only minimal use of alignments to anonymize named entities.\nGrammar-based Parsing Wang et al. (2016) (CAMR) perform a series of shift-reduce transformations on the output of an externally-trained dependency parser, similar to Damonte et al. (2017),\nBrandt et al. (2016), Puzikov et al. (2016), and Goodman et al. (2016). Artzi et al. (2015) use a grammar induction approach with Combinatory Categorical Grammar (CCG), which relies on pretrained CCGBank categories, like Bjerva et al. (2016). Pust et al. (2015) recast parsing as a string-to-tree Machine Translation problem, using unsupervised alignments (Pourdamghani et al., 2014), and employing several external semantic resources. Our neural approach is engineering lean, relying only on a large unannotated corpus of English and algorithms to find and canonicalize named entities.\nNeural Parsing Recently there have been a few seq2seq systems for AMR parsing (Barzdins and Gosko, 2016; Peng et al., 2017). Similar to our approach, Peng et al. (2017) deal with sparsity by anonymizing named entities and typing low frequency words, resulting in a very compact vocabulary (2k tokens). However, we avoid reducing our vocabulary by introducing a large set of unlabeled sentences from an external corpus, therefore drastically lowering the out-of-vocabulary rate (see Section 6).\nAMR Generation Flanigan et al. (2016b) specify a number of tree-to-string transduction rules based on alignments and POS-based features that are used to drive a tree-based SMT system. Pourdamghani et al. (2016) also use an MT decoder; they learn a classifier that linearizes the input AMR graph in an order that follows the output sentence, effectively reducing the number of alignment crossings of the phrase-based decoder. Song et al. (2016) recast generation as a traveling salesman problem, after partitioning the graph into fragments and finding the best linearization order. Our models do not need to rely on a particular linearization of the input, attaining comparable performance even with a per example random traversal of the graph. Finally, all three systems intersect with a large language model trained on Gigaword. We show that our seq2seq model has the capacity to learn the same information as a language model, especially after pretraining on the external corpus.\nData Augmentation Our paired training procedure is largely inspired by Sennrich et al. (2016). They improve neural MT performance for low resource language pairs by using a back-translation MT system for a large monolingual corpus of the target language in order to create synthetic output,\nand mixing it with the human translations. We instead pre-train on the external corpus first, and then fine-tune on the original dataset."}, {"heading": "3 Methods", "text": "In this section, we first provide the formal definition of AMR parsing and generation (section 3.1).

One of these nodes is a distinguished root, for example, the node and in Figure 1. Furthermore, the graph contains labeled edges, which correspond to PropBank-style (Palmer et al., 2005) semantic roles for verbs or other relations introduced for AMR, for example, arg0 or op1 in Figure 1.

We make two modifications to the encoder: (1) we concatenate the forward and backward hidden states at every level of the stack instead of at the top of the stack, and (2) introduce dropout in the first layer of the encoder. The decoder predicts an attention vector over the encoder hidden states using previous decoder states. The attention is used to weigh the hidden states of the encoder and then predict a token in the output sequence. The weighted hidden states, the decoded token, and an attention signal from the previous time step (input feeding) are then fed together as input to the next decoder state. The decoder can optionally choose to output an unknown word symbol, in which case the predicted attention is used to copy a token directly from the input sequence into the output sequence."}, {"heading": "3.3 Linearization", "text": "Our seq2seq models require that both the input and target be presented as a linear sequence of tokens.

A linearization is defined as (1) a linearization order and (2) a rendering function that generates any number of tokens when applied to an element in the linearization order (see Section 4.2 for implementation details).

After each iteration, we increase the size of the sample from Se by an order of magnitude. After we have the best parser from self-training, we use it to label AMRs for Se and pre-train the generator. The final step of the procedure fine-tunes the generator on the original dataset D."}, {"heading": "4 AMR Preprocessing", "text": "We use a series of preprocessing steps, including AMR linerization, anonymization, and other modifications we make to sentence-graph pairs. Our methods have two goals: (1) reduce the complexity of the linearized sequences to make learning easier while maintaining enough original information, and (2) address sparsity from certain open class vocabulary entries, such as named entities (NEs) and quantities. Figure 2(d) contains example inputs and outputs with all of our preprocessing techniques.\nGraph Simplification In order to reduce the overall length of the linearized graph, we first remove variable names and the instance-of relation ( / ) before every concept. In case of re-entrant nodes we replace the variable mention with its co-referring concept. Even though this replacement incurs loss of information, often the\nsurrounding context helps recover the correct realization, e.g., the possessive role :poss in the example of Figure 1 is strongly correlated with the surface form his. Following Pourdamghani et al. (2016) we also remove senses from all concepts for AMR generation only. Figure 2(a) contains an example output after this stage."}, {"heading": "4.1 Anonymization of Named Entities", "text": "Open-class types including NEs, dates, and numbers account for 9.6% of tokens in the sentences of the training corpus, and 31.2% of vocabulary W . 83.4% of them occur fewer than 5 times in the dataset. In order to reduce sparsity and be able to account for new unseen entities, we perform extensive anonymization.\nFirst, we anonymize sub-graphs headed by one of AMR\u2019s over 140 fine-grained entity types that contain a :name role. This captures structures referring to entities such as person, country, miscellaneous entities marked with *-enitity, and typed numerical values, *-quantity. We exclude date entities (see the next section). We then replace these sub-graphs with a token indicating fine-grained type and an index, i, indicating it is the ith occurrence of that type.2 For example, in Figure 2 the sub-graph headed by country gets replaced with country 0.\nOn the training set, we use alignments obtained using the JAMR aligner (Flanigan et al., 2014) and the unsupervised aligner of Pourdamghani et al. (2014) in order to find mappings of anonymized subgraphs to spans of text and replace mapped text with the anonymized token that we inserted into the AMR graph. We record this mapping for use during testing of generation models. If a generation model predicts an anonymization token, we find the corresponding token in the AMR graph and replace the model\u2019s output with the most frequent mapping observed during training for the entity name. If the entity was never observed, we copy its name directly from the AMR graph.\nAnonymizing Dates For dates in AMR graphs, we use separate anonymization tokens for year, month-number, month-name, day-number and day-name, indicating whether the date is mentioned by word or by number.3 In AMR gener-\n2In practice we only used three groups of ids: a different one for NEs, dates and constants/numbers.\n3We also use three date format markers that appear in the text as: YYYYMMDD, YYMMDD, and YYYY-MM-DD.\nation, we render the corresponding format when predicted. Figure 2(b) contains an example of all preprocessing up to this stage.\nNamed Entity Clusters When performing AMR generation, each of the AMR fine-grained entity types is manually mapped to one of the four coarse entity types used in the Stanford NER system (Finkel et al., 2005): person, location, organization and misc. This reduces the sparsity associated with many rarely occurring entity types. Figure 2 (c) contains an example with named entity clusters.\nNER for Parsing When parsing, we must normalize test sentences to match our anonymized training data. To produce fine-grained named entities, we run the Stanford NER system and first try to replace any identified span with a fine-grained category based on alignments observed during training. If this fails, we anonymize the sentence using the coarse categories predicted by the NER system, which are also categories in AMR. After parsing, we deterministically generate AMR for anonymizations using the corresponding text span."}, {"heading": "4.2 Linearization", "text": "Linearization Order Our linearization order is defined by the order of nodes visited by depth first search, including backward traversing steps.

We consider alternative orderings of children in Section 7 but always follow the pattern demonstrated above.\nRendering Function Our rendering function marks scope, and generates tokens following the pre-order traversal of the graph: (1) if the element is a node, it emits the type of the node. (2) if the element is an edge, it emits the type of the edge and then recursively emits a bracketed string for the (concept) node immediately after it. In case the node has only one child we omit the scope markers (denoted with left \u201c(\u201d, and right \u201c)\u201d parentheses), thus significantly reducing the number of generated tokens.

While much of this improvement comes from self-training, our model without Gigaword data outperforms these approaches by 3.5 points on F1. We attribute this increase in performance to different handling of preprocessing and more careful hyper-parameter tuning.

Our full models outperform the original version of JAMR (Flanigan et al., 2014), a graph-based model but still lags behind other parser-dependent systems (CAMR6), and resource heavy approaches (SBMT).\nGeneration Results Table 3 summarizes our AMR generation results on the development and test set. We outperform all previous state-of-theart systems by the first round of self-training and further improve with the next rounds. Our final model trained on GIGA-20M outperforms TSP and TREETOSTR trained on LDC2015E86, by over 9 BLEU points.7 Overall, our model incorporates less data than previous approaches as all reported methods train language models on the whole Gigaword corpus.

We suspect without scope markers our seq2seq models are not as effective at capturing long range semantic relationships between elements of the AMR graph.

On the other hand, the model that follows the human order performs better, which leads us to suspect it carries extra information not apparent in the graphical structure of the AMR.\nTo further investigate, we compared the relative ordering of edge pairs under the same parent to the relative position of children nodes derived from those edges in a sentence, as reported by JAMR alignments. We found that the majority of pairs of AMR edges (57.6%) always occurred in the same relative order, therefore revealing no extra generation order information.8 Of the exam-\n8This is consistent with constraints encoded in the annotation tool used to collect AMR.

The relative ordering of some pairs of AMR edges was particularly indicative of generation order. For example, the relative ordering of edges with types location and time, was 17% more indicative of the generation order than the majority of generated locations before time.9\nTo compare to previous work we still report results using human orderings. However, we note that any practical application requiring a system to generate an AMR representation with the intention to realize it later on, e.g., a dialog agent, will need to be trained either using consistent, or randomderived linearization orders.

We found that the generator mostly suffers from coverage issues, an inability to mention all tokens in the input, followed by fluency mistakes, as illustrated above. Attachment errors are less frequent, which supports our claim that the model is robust to graph linearization, and can successfully encode long range dependency information between concepts."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusions", "text": "We applied sequence-to-sequence models to the tasks of AMR parsing and AMR generation, by carefully preprocessing the graph representation and scaling our models via pretraining on millions of unlabeled sentences sourced from Gigaword corpus.

This formalism tackles certain linguistic phenomena differently from AMR (e.g., negation, and co-reference), contains explicit annotation on concepts for number, tense and case, and finally handles multiple languages10 (Bender, 2014). Taking a step further, we would like to apply our models on Semantics-Based Machine Translation using MRS as an intermediate representation between pairs of languages, and investigate the added benefit compared to directly translating the surface strings, especially in the case of distant language pairs such as English and Japanese (Siegel et al., 2016)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The research was supported in part by DARPA under the DEFT program through AFRL (FA8750-13-2-0019) and the CwC program through ARO (W911NF-15-1-0543), the ARO (W911NF-16-1-0121), the NSF (IIS-1252835, IIS-1562364, IIS-1524371), an Allen Distinguished Investigator Award, Samsung GRO, and gifts by Google and Facebook.

For AMR generation, our model establishes a new state-of-the-art performance of BLEU 33.8. We present extensive ablative and qualitative analysis including strong evidence that sequencebased AMR models are robust against ordering variations of graph-to-sequence conversions.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
