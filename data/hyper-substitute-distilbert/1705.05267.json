Introduction", "text": "Hospitalized patients are vulnerable to a wide range of adverse events, including cardiopulmonary arrests (Kause et al., 2004; Hogan et al., 2012; Yoon et al., 2016), acute respiratory failures (Mokart, 2013), septic shocks (Henry et al., 2015), and post-operative complications\n*Equal contribution 1University of California, Los Angeles, US 2University of Oxford, UK.

For a patient in a regular ward, the occurrence of any such event entails an unplanned transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU), the timing of which is a major determinant of the eventual outcome. Indeed, recent medical studies have confirmed that delayed transfer to the ICU is strongly correlated with morbidity and mortality (Mardini L, 2012; Mokart, 2013). The problem of delayed ICU transfer is enormous and acute: over 750,000 septic shocks and 200,000 cardiac arrests occur in the U.S. each year with mortality rates of 28.6% and 75% respectively (Merchant et al., 2011; Kumar et al., 2011). Fortunately, experts believe that much of these events could be prevented with accurate prognosis and early warning (Nguyen et al., 2007).\nMotivated by the proliferation of electronic health records (EHRs) (currently available in more than 75% of hospitals in the U.S. (Charles et al., 2016)) we develop a datadriven real-time risk score that can promptly assess a hospitalized patient\u2019s risk of clinical deterioration. Our risk score hinges on a novel continuous-time semi-Markovmodulated marked Hawkes process model for a monitored patient\u2019s episode, i.e. the patient\u2019s evolving (latent) clinical states and her corresponding (observed) physiological data. With the guidance of critical care experts, we conducted experiments on a dataset for a cohort of criticallyill patients admitted to a major academic medical center. Results show that our risk score offers significant gains in the accuracy (and timeliness) of predicting clinical deterioration; our risk score attains a 23% improvement in the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) as compared to the technology currently deployed in our medical center. Since it confers a significant prognostic value in subacute care in wards, the proposed risk score is currently being installed in our medical center as a replacement for the current technology.\nThe proposed probabilistic model (based on which our risk score is computed) captures a hospitalized patient\u2019s entire episode as recorded in the EHR. A typical (critical care) patient episode comprises the time of her admission to the ward, the time of her admission to the ICU or discharge from the ward, and a temporal sequence of irregularly sampled physiological data that are collected during her stay\nin the ward (Johnson, 2016; Ghassemi et al., 2015). We model a patient\u2019s episode as being driven by a latent clinical state process, which we represent as a semi-Markov jump process (Yu, 2010), describing the evolution of the patient\u2019s \u201cseverity of illness\u201d over time. All the observable physiological variables are modulated by this process: the times at which clinicians decide to observe the patient\u2019s physiological data are drawn from a Hawkes point process (Hawkes & Oakes, 1974), the intensity of which is modulated by the patient\u2019s clinical state process, whereas the observed physiological data is drawn from a switching multitask Gaussian process with hyper-parameters that depend on the patient\u2019s clinical state. The patient episode is thus a marked Hawkes process \u2013with the physiological data serving as the marks\u2013 that is modulated by the patient\u2019s clinical states. We provide a detailed description of the model in Section 3, and then propose an EM-based algorithm for learning its parameters from the EHR data in Section 4.\nA distinctive feature of our model is its ability to incorporate informative clinical judgments into the generative process for the patient\u2019s episode. The manifestation of informative clinical judgments in the EHR episodes is doublefaceted: the patients\u2019 episodes are both \u201cinformatively sampled\u201d and \u201cinformatively censored\u201d. Informative sampling results from the fact that clinicians decide to observe the patient\u2019s physiological data more intensely if they believe that the patient is in a \u201cbad\u201d clinical state (Moskovitch et al., 2015; Qin & Shelton, 2015)\u2013 a belief that is based on either the clinician\u2019s own assessment of the patient\u2019s state, or the communication between the patient and the ward staff (Kyriacos et al., 2014). Informative censoring results from the clinicians\u2019 decision on when to send the patient to the ICU or discharge her from the ward, which is indeed informative of the \u201c clinical deterioration\u201d or \u201cclinical stability\u201d onsets. In our model, informative censoring is taken into account by adopting an absorbing semi-Markov chain as a model for the patient\u2019s latent clinical states; a patient\u2019s risk score at any point of time is thus defined as the probability of eventual absorption in a \u201cclinical deterioration\u201d state.\nRelated work: Marked point processes have been recently used in a very different context to model checkin data (Du et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2016), but we are not aware of any attempts for their deployment in the medical context. Most of the previous works on risk prognosis for critical care patients viewed informative censoring as a \u201csurrogate label\u201d for a patient\u2019s clinical deterioration, and hence used those labels to train a supervised (regression) model using the physiological data in a fixedsize time window before censoring. The supervised models used in the literature included logistic regression (Ho et al., 2012; Saria et al., 2010), SVMs (Wiens et al., 2012), Gaussian processes (Ghassemi et al., 2015; Yoon et al., 2016) and recurrent neural networks (Che et al., 2016). The main\nlimitation of this approach is that, in addition to the fact that it generally does not deal with informatively sampled episodes, it does not model the entire patient\u2019s physiological trajectory, and hence it does not accurately capture intermediate (subtle) deterioration stages that are indicative of future severe deterioration stages, which leads to a sluggish risk assessment and delayed ICU alarms.\nAnother strand of literature has focused on building probabilistic models, usually variants of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), for the entire patient\u2019s physiological trajectories; applications have ranged from disease progression modeling to neonatal sepsis prediction (Wang et al., 2014; Stanculescu et al., 2014). These models are not capable of dealing with irregularly-sampled data, do not deal with informatively sampled episodes, and are restricted to the Markovianity assumption which entails unrealistically memoryless clinical state transitions. In (Henry et al., 2015), a ranking algorithm was used to construct a risk score for sepsis shocks; however, the approach therein requires the clinicians to provide assessments that order the disease severity at different time instances\u2013 we typically do not have such data in the EHR for ward patients.\nVarious works in the medical literature have proposed \u201cexpert-based\u201d medical risk scores for prognosis in hospital wards (Morgan et al., 1997; Parshuram et al., 2009), some of which are currently used in practice. The medical literature has also suggested the use of mortality risk scores that are normally used in the ICU, such as APACHE-II and SOFA, as risk scores for ward patients (Yu et al., 2014). However, recent systematic reviews have demonstrated the modest net clinical utility of all these scores (Cvach, 2012). More recently, a data-driven medical risk score based on a simple regression model, known as the Rothman index, has been developed and commercialized (Finlay et al., 2014; Rothman et al., 2013). The Rothman index is currently deployed in various major hospitals in the U.S. including our medical center; in Section 5, we show that our risk score significantly outperforms the Rothman index in terms of AUROC and timeliness of ICU admission alarms."}, {"heading": "2. Structure of the EHR Data", "text": "The subacute care data in an EHR typically comprises a set of episodes; each episode is a sequence of vital signs and lab tests (physiological data) that have been gathered (by clinicians) for a hospitalized patient at irregularly spaced time instances during her stay in a ward. The episode starts at the time of admission to the ward, and is concluded by either an unplanned admission to the ICU, which means that the patient was clinically deteriorating, or a discharge from the ward, which means that the patient was clinically stable. We denote an EHR dataset D that comprises the episodes forD patients as D = {Ed}Dd=1, where\nEd is the episode for the dth patient, and is defined as Ed = ({ydm, t d m} Md m=1, T d c , l d), with ydm being the m th Qdimensional physiological variable (vital signs and lab test outcomes) for patient d observed at time tdm, and the total number of samples observed for that patient during her episode isMd. The duration of patient d\u2019s stay in the ward is denoted by T dc , whereas her endpoint outcome (clinical deterioration and ICU admission, or clinical stability and discharge) is declared via a binary variable ld; the realization ld = 1 means that patient d was admitted to the ICU, and ld = 0 means that the patient was discharged home. We stress that the labels ld associated with every episode are neither noisy nor entirely subjective: we assign a label ld = 1 for patients who actually needed a therapeutic intervention in the ICU after an unplanned admission, and assign a label ld = 0 for patients who were discharged and not re-admitted shortly after. We excluded all post-surgical ward patients for whom an ICU admission was preordained since for those patients the prognosis problem is not relevant. Our dataset comprises thousands of episodes for patients admitted to a large medical center over a 3-year period; all the episodes display the structure described above.\nThe clinicians were right! Clinical judgments manifest in the dth episode of D through informative sampling (encoded in the observation times {tdm} Md m=1), and informative censoring (encoded in the episode duration T dc and the endpoint outcome l d). Figure 1 is a depiction for both informative sampling and informative censoring. In Figure 1, we estimate the physiological data (time-varying) sampling rate using all the episodes in our dataset over a time horizon of 35 hours before ICU admission for deteriorating patients (i.e. patients with ld = 1, with t = 0 being the ICU admission time), and we compute the same estimates for stable patients (i.e. patients with ld = 0, with t = 0 being the discharge time).\nWe can see from the trends in Figure 1 that as the deteriorating patient approaches the ICU admission time, the clinicians tend to sample her physiological data more intensely, whereas as the stable patient approaches the discharge time, the clinicians tend to have a more relaxed schedule for observing her vital signs and lab tests. The divergence between the sampling rates for deteriorating and stable patient groups increases as the patients approach their ICU admission and discharge onsets\u2013 that is because the clinicians become less uncertain about the patient\u2019s state as time progresses. We have tested the hypothesis that the sampling rate of deteriorating patients is \u2013on average\u2013 larger than that for stable patients in the last 24 hours before ICU admission or discharge via a two-sample t-test with a significance level of 0.05, and the hypothesis was accepted.\nThe take-away from Figure 1 is that the clinician\u2019s judgment of the patient\u2019s clinical state \u2013manifesting in the vital\nsigns and lab tests sampling rates\u2013 is very predictive of the endpoint outcomes. This implies that there is a room for \u201clearning from the informative clinical judgments\u201d; that is, one can infer the patients\u2019 latent states over time by using the clinicians\u2019 observable sampling patterns as proximal noisy labels for those latent states."}, {"heading": "3. The Semi-Markov-Modulated Marked Hawkes Process Model", "text": "Now we present a probabilistic model for the episodes {Ed}Dd=1 that captures the informative sampling and censoring effects discussed in Section 2. We start by modeling the patient\u2019s latent clinical state process in Subsection 3.1, beforemodeling the observable variables in Subsection 3.2."}, {"heading": "3.1. Latent Clinical States", "text": "We assume that each patient\u2019s episode is governed by an underlying latent clinical state processX(t) that represents the evolution of her \u201cclinical well-being\u201d over time. The patient\u2019s latent clinical state X(t) at any point of time t \u2208 R+ (t = 0 corresponds to the time of admission to the ward) belongs to a finite space X comprisingN states, i.e. X = {1, 2, . ., ., N}. We model informative censoring by assuming that states 1 and N are absorbing states; state 1 is the state of clinically stability, at which the patient can be safely discharged home, whereas state N is the state of clinical deterioration, at which the patient needs to be admitted to the ICU. Whenever the patient is in state 1 or N , her episode is terminated by the clinicians shortly after. All other states in X/{1, N} are transient states in which the patient needs vigilant monitoring by the ward staff.\nThe clinical state processX(t) is a semi-Markov jump process (Yu, 2010), i.e. X(t) = \u2211K\nn=1 Xn \u00b7 1{\u03c4n\u2264t<\u03c4n+1} is a semi-Markov process for which every new state realization Xn starts at a jump time \u03c4n, where \u03c41 = 0, and lasts for a random sojourn time Sn = \u03c4n+1 \u2212 \u03c4n. A total number of K states are realized in the path X(t), where K is indeed random, and XK \u2208 {1, N}, i.e. the patient\u2019s episode is concluded by either clinical deterioration or stability. The advantage of adopting a semi-Markovian\nmodel for the clinical state process is that unlike Markovian models, semi-Markovianity does not imply memoryless transitions\u2013 the transition probability from one clinical state to another at any time depends on the time spent in the current state, a property that has been recently validated in various clinical state models (Taghipour et al., 2013). We adopt an explicit-durationmodel for the state sojourn times (Johnson & Willsky, 2013): the nth state sojourn time Sn is drawn from a Gamma distribution1 with state-specific parameters as follows\nSn|(Xn = i) \u223c Gamma(\u03b3i), \u2200i \u2208 X . (1)\nSince the model includes two absorbing states (1 and N ) for which the notion of sojourn time is inapplicable, we define the variables Sn of such states as the clinicians\u2019 \u201cresponse times\u201d for admitting patients to the ICU or discharging them upon the clinical deterioration/stability onset. The transitions among the clinical states are governed by a semi-Markov transition kernel matrix P = (pij)i,j , i.e.\nP(Xn+1 = j|Xn = i) = pij , (2)\nwhere self-transitions are eliminated for all transient states (Yu, 2010; Johnson & Willsky, 2013), i.e. pii = 0, \u2200i \u2208 X/{1, N}, and enforced for the two absorbing states pii = 1, \u2200i \u2208 {1, N}. The initial state distribution is given by \u03c0 = (\u03c0i) N i=1, where \u03c0i = P(X(0) = i). Every episode Ed in an EHR dataset D is associated with a latent clinical state trajectory {Xdn, S d n} Kd n=1, but we can only observe the absorbing state realization XKd = l d in the EHR data (informative censoring)."}, {"heading": "3.2.

The distributional specifications of our marked point process are given in the following Subsections."}, {"heading": "3.2.1. THE OBSERVATION PROCESS", "text": "We model the observation process generating the physiological variables\u2019 observation times {tm}m\u2208N+ as a doubly stochastic point process whose intensity, \u03bb(t), is a stochastic process modulated by the latent clinical state process X(t). In particular, the observation process {tm}m\u2208N+ is modeled as a one-dimensional Hawkes process with a linear self-exciting intensity function \u03bb(t,X(t)) (Lee et al., 2016), i.e.\n\u03bb(t,X(t) = i) = \u03bboi + \u03b1i \u2211\n\u03c4<tm<t\ne\u2212\u03b2i(t\u2212tm), (3)\n\u2200 i \u2208 X ,, where \u03bboi , \u03b1i and \u03b2i are the state-dependent intensity parameters, e\u2212\u03b2i(t\u2212tm) is an exponential triggering kernel, and \u03c4 < t is the time of the most recent jump in X(t). In order to ensure the local stationarity of the Hawkes process within the sojourn time of every latent state, we assume that \u03b1i \u03b2i\n< 1, \u2200i \u2208 X (Roueff et al., 2016); the expected value of the intensity function is therefore given by E[\u03bb(t,X(t) = i)] = \u03bboi\n1\u2212\u03b1i \u03b2i\n. For \u03b2i = \u221e or\n\u03b1i = 0, we recover a modulated Poisson process as a special case (Pan et al., 2016).\nIn Figure 2, we depict the observation times in two patients\u2019 episodes: patient A being a clinically deteriorating patient, and patient B being a clinically stable patient. We can see that patient A\u2019s episode had its sampling rate escalating as her condition was worsening; the sampling rate remained\nintense after she was admitted to the ICU. On the other hand, patient B\u2019s episode exhibited a decelerating sampling rate on her path to clinical stability. We can also notice that the observation times display a subtle \u201cclustered\u201d pattern that point out to their temporal dependencies\u2013 indeed, the clinicians are not memoryless, and the times at which they observe the physiological data are dependent. In the light of the above, the modulated Hawkes process described above appears to be a sensible model for the observation process {tm}m\u2208N+ as it captures both the time-varying intensity and the temporal dependencies illustrated in Figure 2."}, {"heading": "3.2.2. THE MARK PROCESS", "text": "Nowwe provide the distributional specification of themark process {ym}m\u2208N+ . Since the physiological data are irregularly sampled from an underlying continuous-time physiological process Y (t) at the sampling times determined by the observation process {tm}m\u2208N+ , a convenientmodel for Y (t) is a switching Gaussian Process defined as follows: Y (t) = \u2211K\nn=1 Yn(t)1{\u03c4n\u2264t<\u03c4n+1}, with\nYn(t)|(Xn = i) \u223c GP(mi(t), ki(t, t \u2032)), (4)\nwhere mi(t) and ki(t, t \u2032) are the state-dependent mean function and covariance kernel, respectively. We use a constant mean functionmi(t) = mi and aMate\u0301rn kernel given by\nki(t, t \u2032) =\n(\u221a 2vi\u22121 |t\u2212t\u2032|\n\u2113i\n)vi\u2212 12 Kvi\u2212 12 (\u221a 2vi\u22121 |t\u2212t\u2032| \u2113i ) 2vi\u2212 3 2 \u0393(vi \u2212 1 2 ) ,\n(5)\nwhere vi \u2208 N+, \u2113i \u2208 R+, \u0393(.) is the Gamma function and Kvi\u2212 12 (.) is a modified Bessel function (Rasmussen, 2006).\nOur choice for theMate\u0301rn kernel is motivated by its ability to represent various commonly used stochastic processes; for instance, when vi = 1, then Yn(t)|(Xn = i) is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (Rasmussen, 2006), whereas for a general integer value of vi, Yn(t)|(Xn = i) is a continuous-time analogue of the Auto-regressive process AR(vi)\u2013 a process that has been widely used to model physiological time-series data (Stanculescu et al., 2014). By constructing Yn(t) as a continuous-time analog of the AR model, the process Y (t) = \u2211K\nn=1 Yn(t)1{\u03c4n\u2264t\u2264\u03c4n+1} becomes a continuous-time switching AR model that is modulated by the patient\u2019s latent clinical state process X(t). We observe the continuous-time process Y (t) only at the sampling times dictated by the observation process (tm)m\u2208N+ , and the resulting process {ym}m\u2208N+ defines the mark process. The observation process together with the mark process, bothmodulated by the latent clinical state process X(t), constitute a marked Hawkes process, which completely describes a patient\u2019s episode.\nThe mark process defined above is one-dimensional, and hence we need to extend the definition to handle a multidimensional process that represents multiple lab tests and vital signs. In other words, we seek a continuoustime analog of the switching Vector Auto-regressive (VAR) model rather than an AR model2. This is achieved by adopting a multi-task Gaussian Process as a model for the Q-dimensional physiological process Y (t) \u2208 R Q (Durichen et al., 2015). That is, we assume that Yn(t)|(Xn = i) \u223c GP(mi(t),Ki(t, t\u2032)), where the covariance kernel Ki(t, t \u2032) = {ki(r, g, t, t\u2032)} Q r,g=1 is based on the intrinsic correlation model (Bonilla et al., 2007), i.e. Ki(t, t \u2032) can be written in the following separable form\nki(r, g, t, t \u2032) = \u03a3i(r, g) \u00b7 ki(t, t \u2032), (6)\nwhere ki(r, g, t, t \u2032) is the covariance between the rth physiological variable at time t and the gth physiological variable at time t\u2032, \u03a3i is a Q \u00d7 Q intrinsic correlation matrix, and ki(t, t\n\u2032) is the Mate\u0301rn kernel in (5). For every state i, we denote the multi-task GP parameter set as \u0398i = (mi(t),Ki(t, t\n\u2032)), and the Hawkes process parameter set as \u039bi. The entire model parameters can be bundled in the parameter set \u2126 as follows\n\u2126 = {P, (\u03c0i, \u03b3i,\u039bi,\u0398i)i\u2208X }.\nGiven a parameter set \u2126, we can easily generate sample patient episodes from our model by first sampling a state sequence {X1, . . ., XK} using the semi-Markov transition kernel, then sampling a corresponding sequence of sojourn times {S1, . . ., SK} from the state-dependent Gamma distributions, then sampling a set of multi-task Gaussian process {Y1(t), . . ., YK(t)}, and finally sampling a sequence of observation times {tm}Mm=1 using Ogata\u2019smodified thinning algorithm (Ogata, 1981).

Since the E-divisive algorithm is nonparametric, we are able to estimate the onsets of all clinical states, i.e. the jump times of Xd(t), prior to finding the estimate \u2126\u0302. We let the E-divisive algorithm jointly detect changes in the distributions of the observable variables {ydm} Md m=1 and the observation process {t d m} Md m=1 by creating an augmented vector of observables that comprises both the physiological observations and a \u201cdifferential\u201d observation process, i.e.\n{\u03c4\u0302d1 , . . ., \u03c4\u0302 d Kd} = E-divisive((y d 1 ,\u2206t d 1), . . ., (y d Md ,\u2206t d Md)),\nwhere \u2206tdm = t d m \u2212 t d m\u22121, with \u2206t d 1 = 0. By the end of this step, we obtain an estimate for the start and end times of all clinical state realizations for every episode Ed.\nStep 2: Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of the absorbing states\u2019 parameters\n3The details for all the algorithms in this Section are provided in Appendix C in the supplementary material.\nBy virtue of informative censoring, we know the identities of all the absorbing states, i.e. Xd Kd\n= ld, \u2200d. Now that we have estimates for the onsets of the absorbing states, obtained from step 1, then we can estimate the response times as S\u0302d Kd = T dc \u2212 \u03c4\u0302 d Kd\n, \u22001 \u2264 d \u2264 D. Define the (fully observable) sub-datasetDi as follows\nDi = {\n(ym, tm){tm\u2265\u03c4\u0302d Kd\n}, S\u0302 d Kd : l\nd = i, Ed \u2208 D } ,\n\u2200i \u2208 {0, 1}. Given such a fully fledged specification of the absorbing states\u2019 onsets, identities, and the corresponding physiological variables, we can directly apply MLE to estimate the parameters \u03981,\u0398N , \u03b31, \u03b3N ,\u039b1 and \u039bN . Using the datasetDi, the parameter\u0398i is estimated using the gradient method for Gaussian processes as in (Bonilla et al., 2007), \u03b3i is estimated using the standard MLE estimating equations, and \u039bi is estimated by maximizing the recursive likelihood formula in (Ogata, 1981) using the Nelder-Mead simplex method (Nelder & Mead, 1965).\nStep 3: Estimation of the transient states\u2019 parameters using the EM algorithm While the absorbing states are observable, the transient states are all hidden. In order to estimate the parameters P, {\u0398i} N\u22121 i=2 , {\u03b3i} N\u22121 i=2 , and {\u039bi} N\u22121 i=2 , we use the jump times\u2019 estimates {\u03c4\u0302d1 , . . ., \u03c4\u0302 d Kd\u22121} (obtained from step 1) in order to segment every episode d into a set of finite transition, and hence we obtain a discrete-time HMM-like process. We truncate all the episodes by removing the data belonging to the absorbing state, and run the EM algorithm in order to estimate the transient state parameters. The EM algorithm takes advantage of informative censoring in the forward-backwardmessage passing stage by computing the backward messages conditioned on the identity of the endpoint absorbing state ld for every episode d."}, {"heading": "4.2.

Results", "text": "We ran the offline learning algorithm in Subsection 4.1 (with 1000 EM iterations) on the 5,000 training episodes in D, and obtained an estimate \u2126\u0302 for the semi-Markovmodulated marked Hawkes process that describes the patient cohort. Using the Bayesian information criterion, we selected an instantiation of our model with 4 clinical states, where state 1 is the clinical stability (absorbing) state, and state 4 is the clinical deterioration (absorbing) state. The learned Hawkes process intensity functions for these two states are given by\n\u03bb(t, 1) = 0.55 \ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\nBaseline intensity \u2193\n+ 0.2 \u2211\ntm\ne\u22128.46(t\u2212tm)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nTemporal dependencies \u2193\n,\n\u03bb(t, 4) = 0.82 \ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\nBaseline intensity \u2191\n+ 0.16 \u2211\ntm\ne\u22121.36(t\u2212tm)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 Temporal dependencies \u2191\n,\nwhere \u03bb(t,X(t)) is measured in samples per hour. We note that the estimated Hawkes process parameters accu-\nrately describe the clinicians\u2019 judgments; when the patient is in the deteriorating state (state 4), the clinicians tend to observe her physiological measurements more frequently. This manifests in the baseline intensity of \u03bb(t, 4) being 50% higher than that of \u03bb(t, 1). Moreover, we note that when the patient is clinically stable (state 1), the temporal dependencies between the observation times almost disappear as the exponential triggering kernel plays little role in determining the observation times, i.e. \u03bb(t, 1) \u2248 0.55, which renders the observation process closer to a Poisson process. Contrarily, when the patient is deteriorating, strong temporal dependencies are displayed in the observation times\u2013 this is intuitive since for a deteriorating patient, the follow-up times decided by the clinicians strongly depend on what have been observed in the past. These distinguishing state-specific features of the clinical judgments are the essence of informative sampling, which allows us to integrate physiological data together with clinical experience while learning the patient\u2019s physiological model.\nWe illustrate the value of informative sampling in Figure 4 through an episode for a cardiac patient who was admitted in the ward for 1 week before being sent to the ICU upon a cardiac arrest. When running the offline learning algorithm in Section 4.1 while assuming that the observation process {tdm}m is uninformative (i.e. \u03bb(t, i) = \u03bb(t, j), \u2200i, j \u2208 X ), the detected clinical deterioration onset is only 10 hours ahead of the cardiac arrest event (onset (2) in Figure 4): this is because the states are estimated solely based on the physiological data, and hence the clinical deterioration state is detected only when the patient\u2019s heart rate fell below 60 beats per minute (BPM). When running the learning again but with informative sampling taken into account, the detected clinical deterioration onset is 40 hours ahead of the cardiac arrest event (onset (1) in Figure 4); this is the time instance at which the clinicians decided to monitor the patient more vigilantly (i.e. more intense sampling rate) even though the evidence for an upcoming cardiac arrest in her heart rate trajectory was rather subtle. The clinicians\u2019 decision to intensely observe the patient\u2019s physiological trajectory is based either on their experience, or on apparent symptoms or complains from the patient that were not recorded in the EHR. By integrating the clinicians\u2019 judgments into our model, we are able to capture the\nsubtleties in the patients\u2019 temporal physiological parameters, and hence learn more accurate representations for the clinical states.\nWe then computed the real-time risk score (as described in Subsection 4.2) for the testing episodes, and compared its sensitivity-precision AUCROC with that of the baseline risk scoring methods listed hereunder.\nMedical Risk Scores: we considered the two most commonly used medical risk scores in regular wards\u2013 the MEWS score (Morgan et al., 1997) and the Rothman index4 (Rothman et al., 2013). We implemented the MEWS score and the Rothman index as described in (Kyriacos et al., 2014) and (Rothman et al., 2013), respectively. We also included the APACHE-II and SOFA scores in our comparisons.\nMachine Learning Algorithms: we considered the traditional approach for real-time risk scoring, which treats informative censoring as a surrogate label based on which a supervised regression model is learned offline, and then risk scoring is applied in real-time using the temporal data within a sliding window\u2013 we call these methods \u201cslidingwindow methods\u201d. We implemented sliding-window methods based on logistic regression (Ho et al., 2012; Saria et al., 2010), random forests, and Gaussian process regression (Ghassemi et al., 2015; Yoon et al., 2016). In addition, we compared our risk score with a standard Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian emissions. The relevant physiological measurements for every baseline were selected through the correlated feature selection method (Yu & Liu, 2003). The hyper-parameters of all the baselines, including the size of the sliding window for the supervised learning methods, were optimized via cross-validation. To handle the irregularly sampled data, we discretized the time horizon into 1-hour steps and fed the baselines with interpolated, discrete-time episodes.\nIn Table 1, we compare the performance of our risk score with the baselines in terms of the sensitivity-precision AUROC. As we can see, the proposed risk score offers a 23% AUROC improvement as compared to the best performing medical risk score \u2013the Rothman index\u2013 which was the score deployed in our medical center at the time of conducting this experiment. Moreover, our risk score also provides significant gains over discriminative sliding-window regression models; the proposed risk score achieves a 11.5% AUROC improvement as compared to the best performing ML algorithm (random forest). In addition, the proposed risk score achieves a 16% AUROC improvement as compared to a standardHMMwith Gaussian emission vari-\n4At the time of conducting these experiments, the Rothman index was deployed in more than 60 major hospitals in the US.\nables5. On average, our risk score prompts ICU alarms 8 hours before the censoring time at a sensitivity of 50% and precision of 35%."}, {"heading": "6. Discussion: Chicken-and-egg", "text": "We stress that while computing our risk score for the testing episodes, we did not use the information conveyed in the observation process {tdm}m to infer the patients\u2019 clinical states. This is because in practice, the value of the realtime risk score R(t) itself influences the clinician\u2019s behavior and hence impacts the observation process, creating a chicken-and-egg dilemma in which one cannot clearly conceptualize the causal relation between the risk score and the clinicians\u2019 judgments. A very interesting research direction is to consider an observation process that is modulated by both the patient\u2019s state and the real-time risk score through an intensity function \u03bb(t,X(t), R(t)), where the algorithm learns the clinical state representation online by \u201csharing experience\u201d with the clinicians. That is, the algorithm uses the clinician\u2019s judgments to refine its clinical state model, which leads to a refined risk score R(t) that would in turn allow the clinician to exhibit more accurate judgments; an online learning process that would ideally converge to a state of \u201cshared knowledge\u201d between the clinician and the system.\nThe significant prognostic value offered by our risk score promises a great improvement in the quality of subacute care in wards. By utilizing the proposed score instead of the current technology, clinicians in a crowded ward can better focus their attention on patients at real risk of deterioration, and can also plan for timely ICU admissions and effective therapeutic interventions.

Here we assume, as usual, that the noise process e(t) is zero mean with a Dirac-delta autocorrelation function, i.e. E[e(t)] = 0 and E[e(t) \u00b7 e(t \u2212 l)] = 0, \u2200 l \u2208 N+. Note that when e(t) is assumed to be Gaussian, then y(t) is an order-p Gauss-Markov process. The continuous-time version of the VAR process y(t) is one that is defined using a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that is equivalent to the difference equation in (A1), i.e.\ny(t) = e(t) +A1 \u00b7 \u2202y(t)\n\u2202t + . . .+Ap \u00b7\n\u2202py(t)\n\u2202tp , (A2)\nwhere \u2202y(t) \u2202t is the component-wise derivative of the vector-valued process y(t) with respect to t. Now we want to find the power spectrum Sy(\u03c9) for the (stationary) process corresponding to the SDE in (A2). This is achieved by conceptualizing (A2) as an LTI system with a white noise process as the input and the VAR process y(t) as the output, and thus computing the power spectrum as Sy(\u03c9) = |H(j\u03c9)|2, where H(j\u03c9) is the LTI system\u2019s transfer function assuming that the noise process e(t) has a normalized (unity) power spectrum.

(A5)\nSince we assumed (without loss of generality) that E(j\u03c9) = 1, then the power spectrum of any component of y(t) can thus be found by examining the structure of Smy (\u03c9) = | \u2211 n hmn(j\u03c9)| 2 = ( \u2211\nn hmn(j\u03c9)) \u00b7 ( \u2211\nn hmn(\u2212j\u03c9)).\nLet us take the case whenAn = diag(an,11, . . ., an,QQ) is a diagonal matrix for every n.

(C9)\nIn other words, the risk score R(t) is the probability of the patient\u2019s eventual absorption in the deteriorating state N given the observable physiological data up to time t. The expression in (C9) can be decomposed using Bayes\u2019 rule as follows\nR(t) = \u2211\ni\u2208X P(X(t) = i|{ym, tm})P(X(\u221e) = N |X(t) = i).\n(C10)\nGiven the model parameters \u2126, one can easily compute the transition probabilities P(X(t + \u2206t) = j|X(t) = i) for any \u2206t, i and j using the parameter the semi-Markov transition kernel and the sojourn time distributions. (For a semi-Markov chain, the transition probabilities are the solutions of a Volterra integral equation, which parallels the Chapman-Kolomogrov equations in ordinary Markov chains.) Now we focus on the term P(X(t) = i|{ym, tm}): the posterior distribution of the current state given the observations up to the current time. We compute this term using forward-filtering. Define the forward message as\n\u03b1(tm, i) = P(X(t) = i, {ym, tm}). (C11)\nThe forward messages in (C11) are computed efficiently using dynamic programming as in (Yu, 2010).

We jointly detect the changes in the distributions of the observable variables {ydm} Md m=1 and the observation process {tdm} Md m=1 by creating an augmented vector of observables that comprises both the physiological observations and a \u201cdifferential\u201d observation process as follows: \n     \n\n     \ny1(1) y1(2) ... y1(Q) \u2206t1\n\n      , . . .,\n\n     \nym(1) ym(2)\n...\nym(Q) \u2206tm\n\n      , . . .,\n\n     \nyM (1) yM (2)\n...\nyM (Q) \u2206tM\n\n     \n\n     \nwhere \u2206tm = tm \u2212 tm\u22121, with \u2206t1 = 0. We run the E-divisive algorithm with a significance level of 0.05 for the permutation test and a parameter setting \u03b1 = 1 for the moment distance. The output of this step is a set of jump\ntime estimates {\u03c4\u03021, . . ., \u03c4\u0302K}.\nStep 2: Now that we have estimates for the onsets of the absorbing state \u03c4\u0302K , obtained from step 1, then we can estimate the response times as S\u0302K = Tc \u2212 \u03c4\u0302K . Let us assume that we have a set of D episodes absorbed in state 1 for whom the estimated response times are {S\u0302dK} D d=1 with labels {ld = 0}Dd=1, and let the Gamma distribution parameters be \u03b31 = {k1, \u03b21}.

For an episode with absorbed in state i \u2208 {1, N}, we estimate the multi-task GP parameter \u0398i using the gradient method as in (Bonilla et al., 2007).

The cohort involved all the hospital\u2019s major units, namely, the cardiac observation floor, the cardiothoracic floor, the hematology and stem cell transplant floor, the liver transplant service and the critical care pediatrics unit. The cohort involved patients who were undergoing narcotic drugs or chemotherapy, and hence are very are vulnerable to adverse outcomes that require an impending ICU transfer. The patients\u2019 cohort displays vast heterogeneity in terms of a wide variety of diagnoses and ICD-9 codes including leukemia, hypertension, septicemia, sepsis, pneumonia, and renal failure. The distribution of the most frequent ICD-9 codes in the patient cohort (together with the corresponding diagnoses) is provided in Table 6.\nEvery patient\u2019s episode in the cohort is associated with a set of 21 (temporal) physiological streams comprising a set of vital signs and lab tests that are listed as follows.\nVital signs\n\u2022 Diastolic blood pressure\n\u2022 Systolic blood pressure\n\u2022 Glasgow coma scale score\n\u2022 Heart rate\n\u2022 Eye opening\n\u2022 Respiratory rate\n\u2022 Temperature\n\u2022 O2 saturation and device assistance\n\u2022 Best motor and verbal responses.\nLab tests\n\u2022 Chloride\n\u2022 Glucose\n\u2022 Urea nitrogen\n\u2022 White blood cell count\n\u2022 Creatinine\n\u2022 Hemoglobin\n\u2022 Platelet count\n\u2022 Potassium\n\u2022 Sodium\n\u2022 CO2\nIn all the experiments, we split the patient cohort into a training set, covering episodes for a 2.5 year period, and a testing set, covering episodes recorded over a 6 month period. The training set comprises 5,000 episodes, whereas the testing set comprises 1,094 episodes. All the patient episodes in the cohort were informatively censored. That is, for every patient in the cohort, we know the following information: the censoring time Tc, i.e. the length of stay of each patient in the ward. The average hospitalization time (or censoring time) in the ward was 150 hours and 24 minutes. The patient episodes\u2019 censoring times ranged from 4 hours to more than 2,500 hours. We also know the absorbing clinical state (l) for every patient.\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASELINES\nIn this Section, we present the details of our implementation for all the baseline algorithms involved in the comparisons in Section 5. We first start by explaining how the state-of-the-art clinical risk scores were implemented.\nImplementation of the Clinical Risk Scores\n(1) Rothman Index: we implement the stepwise logis-\ntic regression scheme adopted by the Rothman index as described in (Rothman et al., 2013). The Rothman risk score was computed as in equation (1) and (2) in (Rothman et al., 2013), i.e.\nRothman Index =\n[\nRIno lab\n( Time since lab\n48\n)]\n+\nSmoothing function\n[\nRIlab\n(\n1\u2212 Time since lab\n48\n)]\n,\nwhere the \u201cRI\u201d for every lab test (or vital sign) are obtained from Figure A1 in (Rothman et al., 2013) for the\nentire 21 vital signs and lab tests available in the EHR, and the smoothing function is obtained from Appendix B in (Rothman et al., 2013). The \u201cTime since lab\u201d variable is the last time (in hours) in which the corresponding lab test (or vital sign) was gathered, and its maximum value is 48 hours. At the time of conducting these experiments, the Rothman index was deployed in the medical center from which we obtained the data.\n(2) Modified Early Warning System (MEWS): we\nimplemented MEWS as specified in (Morgan et al., 1997). The MEWS score typically ranges from 0 to 3 and is computed over time based on the instantaneous values of the following cardinal vital signs: systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, SaO2, temperature, and heart rate. Table 2 provides the MEWS risk scoring function in terms of those vital signs.\n(3) Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA): a\nrisk score (ranging from 1 to 4) that is used to determine the extent of a hospitalized patient\u2019s respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal and neurological organ function in the ICU.\n(4) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation\n(APACHE-II): a risk scoring system (an integer score from 0 to 71) for predicting mortality of patients in the ICU. The score is based on 12 physiological measurements, including creatinine, white blood cell count, and Glasgow coma scale.\nWe note that while the SOFA and APACHE II scores were originally constructed for deployed for patients in the ICU, both scores have been recently shown to provide a prognostic utility for predicting clinical deterioration for patients in regular wards (Yu et al., 2014), and hence we consider both scores in our comparisons. Our implementation for APACHE-II and SOFA followed that in (Yu et al., 2014).\nImplementation of the machine learning baselines\nWe have not used any of the patients\u2019 static features (e.g. age, gender, diagnoses, etc) in the baselines to ensure a fair comparison with the medical risk scores, which ignore those features. For all the baseline (including our algorithm), the relevant physiological time series for every baseline were selected through the correlated feature selectionmethod (Yu & Liu, 2003). The hyper-parameters of all the baselines, including the size of the sliding window for the supervised learning methods, were optimized via cross-validation. In order to handle the irregularly sampled data, we discretized the time horizon into 1-hour steps and fed the baselines with spline-interpolated, discrete-time episodes.\nIn the following, we provide the implementation details for the different machine learning baselines.\n(1) Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian Emissions:\ninformative censoring informationwas incorporated by including two absorbing HMM states for clinical stability (l = 0) and deterioration (l = 1). We used the Baum-Welch algorithm for learning the HMM, and informed the forward-backward algorithm with the labeled states l at the end of every episode. We initialized the Baum-Welch algorithm with seed parameter estimates that are obtained using aK-means clustering of the patients\u2019 episodes followed by change-point detection (using E-divisive) and then MLE for a labeled HMM. The complete data log likelihood after 200 EM iterations was -5.35\u00d7 106. Using the Bayesian information criterion, we selected an HMM with 5 states (2 of which are absorbing). In the testing phase, a patient\u2019s risk score at every point of time is computed by first applying forward filtering to obtain the posterior probability of the patient\u2019s states, and then averaging over the distribution of the absorbing states.\n(2) Sliding Window Methods: in order to ensure that\nthe censoring information is utilized by all the slidingwindow predictors, we trained every predictor by constructing a training dataset that comprises the physiological data gathered within a temporal window before the censoring event (ICU admission or patient discharge), and using the censoring information (i.e. the variable l) as the labels. The size of this window is a hyper-parameter that is tuned separately for every predictor. For the testing data, the predictors are applied sequentially to a sliding window of every patient\u2019s episode, and the predictor\u2019s output is considered as the patient\u2019s real-time risk score. This differs from the static simulation setting in (Ghassemi et al., 2015) were predictions are issued in a one-shot fashion using only the data obtained within 24 hours after a patient\u2019s admission. We used the built-in MATLAB functions for training the logistic regression and the random forest predictors. For SW-GP, we used multitask Gaussian process regression using squared exponential kernel and using the free-form parametrization in (Bonilla et al., 2007), and used the gradient method to learn the parameters of two Gaussian process models: one for patients with l = 0, and one for patients with l = 1. The risk score for a patient\u2019s risk score is computed as the test statistic of a sequential hypothesis test that is based on the two learned Gaussian process models as in (Yoon et al., 2016). Hence, the SW-GP baseline is a combination of the methods in (Ghassemi et al., 2015) and (Yoon et al., 2016) that is capable of handling irregularly sampled data."}], "references": [{"title": "Multi-task gaussian process prediction", "author": ["Bonilla", "Edwin V", "Chai", "Kian M", "Williams", "Christopher"], "venue": "In Advances in neural information processing systems,", "citeRegEx": "Bonilla et al\\.,? \\Q2007\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bonilla et al\\.", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Electronic capabilities for patients among us non-federal acute care hospitals: 2008-2014. onc data brief 29. office of the national coordinator for health information technology: Washington dc, 2016", "author": ["D Charles", "M Gabriel", "J.

In addition, our model captures \u201cinformatively censored\u201d patient episodes by representing the patient\u2019s latent clinical states as an absorbing semi-Markov jump process. The model parameters are learned from offline patient episodes in the electronic health records via an EM-based algorithm. Experiments conducted on a cohort of patients admitted to a major medical center over a 3-year period show that risk prognosis based on our model significantly outperforms the currently deployed medical risk scores and other baseline machine learning algorithms.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
