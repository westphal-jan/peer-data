It provides a basic mathematical framework for dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. It finds wide applications in engineering systems, operations research, artificial intelligence and computer games.\nConsider the infinite-horizon discounted-reward MDP with finitely many states and finitely many actions. An instance of such MDP can be described by a tuple M = (S,A, P, r, \u03b3) where S is a finite state space, A is a finite action space , \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1) is the discount factor , r : S \u00d7 A 7\u2192 [0, 1] is the reward function and P = (Pa)a\u2208A is the collection of matrices of transition probabilities. The size of a MDP model is O(|S|2|A|).\nThe MDP tuple M specifies a controlled random walk on the state space S. When action a \u2208 A is selected at state i \u2208 S, the system transitions to a state j \u2208 S with probability Pa(i, j) and receives the reward ria. A (stationary) deterministic policy \u03c0 : S 7\u2192 A is a mapping from states to actions. A randomized policy can be viewed as a collection of probability distributions for choosing actions at each state. The value vector v\u03c0 \u2208 R|S| under a policy \u03c0 is defined as\nv\u03c0(i) = E\u03c0\n[ \u221e\u2211\nk=0\n\u03b3krik\u03c0(ik) | i0 = i ] , (1)\nwhere (i0, i1, . . . ) is the path of state transitions generated by the Markov chain under policy \u03c0 and the expectation is taken over the path. It is known [Bel57] that there exists an optimal deterministic policy that maximizes the value vector for all states simultaneously, yielding the optimal value vector v\u2217 = max\u03c0 v\u03c0. Our objective is to find a (stationary and possibly randomized) policy that performs nearly well as the optimal policy. We say that a policy \u03c0 is -optimal if \u2016v\u2217 \u2212 v\u03c0\u2016\u221e \u2264 .\nIn this paper, we study the computational complexity of finding an -optimal policy of the MDP. We focus on the running-time complexity, which is the sum of the number of arithmetic operations (including\n\u2217Yichen Chen is with Department of Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton 08544, USA. \u2020Mengdi Wang is with Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton\n08544, USA.\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n07 31\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C C\n] 2\n0 M\nay 2\naddition, subtraction, multiplication and division) and the number of queries to input data (each query asks for one specified entry of the input). Although the MDP is a classical problem that has been studied for years, there has been few results on its computational complexity lower bound. We have not been able to find comparable existing work. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on lower bounds of the computational complexity for finite-state finite-action MDP.\nOur main results are summarized as follows:\n1. We show that for the standard discounted MDP, the running time needed to compute an -optimal policy with probability at least 9/10 is\n\u2126(|S|2|A|). as long as < \u03b34(1\u2212\u03b3) . This result asserts that the running-time complexity of MDP is at least linear with respect to the input size O(|S|2|A|).\n2. We also consider two variants of the discounted MDP where the input is given in specific data structures: arrays of cumulative sums or binary trees. In these two cases, we show that the running time needed to compute an -optimal policy with probability at least 9/10 is\n\u2126\n( \u03b3\n1\u2212 \u03b3 \u00b7 |S||A|\n) .\nThis result suggests that the complexity of MDP reduces when the input data is given in convenient data structures. It leaves open the possibility for obtaining approximate solutions in sublinear running time.\nSimilar phenomenon has been observed in a recent paper that studies the running-time complexity upper bounds of discounted MDP [Wan17]. In [Wan17], an upperbound O\u0303 ( |S|3|A| ) was established for the standard MDP using a randomized primal-dual algorithm. The upper bound was shown to reduce to O\u0303 ( |S||A| 2 ) under\nsome additional assumption on the ergodicity when the input is given in convenient data structures (i.e., sorted arrays, cumulative probabilities, and binary trees). The main advantage of these data structures is that they enable immediate simulation of the Markov process in the algorithm, requiring zero preprocessing time.\nLet us compare our lower bound results with the upper bounds mentioned above. Although there remains a gap between the upper and lower bounds, there seems to be a sharp contrast between the case with standard input and the case where the input data is given in convenient data structures. This contrast leads us to a counter intuitive conjecture:\nThe computational complexity for solving the MDP depends on the data structure of the input.\nMore importantly, the nice data structures that lead to a lower computational complexity happen to be those that enable immediate sampling of the Markov state transitions. This observation draws an intriguing connection between the running-time complexity for solving the MDP and the sample complexity for estimating the optimal policy. Yet this connection is not fully understood. We believe that this work on complexity lower bounds for the MDP will provide critical insights into the complexity of sequential decision-making problems and reinforcement learning. We hope these results will motivate sharper analysis and better algorithms."}, {"heading": "2 Related Works", "text": "Complexity analysis for the MDP has a long history started by Bellman [Bel57]. The MDP was known to be solvable in polynomial time by dynamic programming [PT87]. Yet the complexity\u2019s dependence on the size of the state space and the action space is not clear.\nThere are three major approaches for solving the MDP: the value iteration method, the policy iteration method, and the linear programming method. Most of the existing works focus on establishing the upper bound of the computational complexity for these methods; see e.g., [How60, Tse90, LDK95, MS99, Ye05,\nYe11, Sch13, FH14]. The best known complexity results for these methods are superlinear with respect to the input size O(|S|2|A|). Recently, [Wan17] developed a randomized primal-dual method that achieves a sublinear running time O ( |S||A| 2 ) under additional assumptions on the ergodicity and the format of the\nMDP input. In contrast to the large volumes of upper bound results, there are fewer results on the complexity lower bound. Papadimitriou and Tsitsiklis [PT87] showed that the MDP is complete for P and its partial information variant is PSPACE-complete. Chow and Tsitsiklis [CT89] established a complexity lower bound of \u2126( 1 2n+m ) for continuous-state Markov decision process under some smoothness conditions, where n, m are the dimensions of the continuous state and action spaces respectively. Blondel and Tsitsiklis [BT00] surveyed basic results on the complexity of the MDP and more general stochastic control problems. Friedman, Hansen and Zwich [FHZ11] established subexponential lower bound for the simplex method applied to MDP using randomized pivoting rules. Hansen and Zwich [HZ10] showed that Howard\u2019s policy iteration algorithms require at least \u2126(|S|2) iterations for the deterministic MDP with average cost. Yet most of these results apply to specific algorithms. We are interested in developing a lower bound that works for arbitrary algorithms. To our best knowledge, such a result is missing in the literature.\nDespite the lack of existing results on the computational complexity, a related notion called sample complexity has been widely studied in the setting of reinforcement learning; e.g., [EDMM02, MT04, SLW+06, SLL09, AMK12, LH12, DB15]. Sample complexity is the number of state transitions one needs to observe in order to estimate the optimal policy. In existing works on sample complexity, although the settings and assumptions vary from one to another, the sample complexity results are typically \u2126( |S||A| 2 ). Apparently the notion of sample complexity is fundamentally different from the notion of running-time complexity. Thus the corresponding results cannot be directly compared.\nOur proof of the lower bound for computational complexity is inspired by works in theoretical computer science. For example, Clarkson, Hazan and Woodruff [CHW12] shows that in order to achieve -optimality for linear classification problem, the algorithm needs to query at least \u2126( \u22122(m + n)) entries of the m by n input matrix. Our analysis involves constructing a tree program, which shares a similar spirit as [BFK+81, BFMadH+87, Yao94, Raz16]. These works study the time-space tradeoff for computation problems such as sorting and parity learning, while our work focuses on the time complexity for the MDP and assumes adequate space. Our analysis is also related to the relational adversary method proposed in [Amb00, Aar06]."}, {"heading": "3 Main Theorems", "text": "In this section, we establish the lower bound of computational complexity for any algorithm that takes the specification of an instance of MDP as input and outputs a policy. We will show that the format and data structure of the input is of vital importance. We consider three distinct cases: (1) the standard case where the transition probabilities P are given as arrays; (2) the case where the cumulative probabilities are given instead of transition probabilities; (3) the case where the transition probabilities are given in the format of binary trees. We will show that the first case is more difficult than the latter two cases. The proofs are deferred to Sections 4, 5 and Appendix.\nFirst we consider the standard case and define Standard MDP as follows.\nDefinition 1 (Standard MDP). The input of Standard MDP includes:\n\u2022 Transition probability matrices Pa of dimension |S| \u00d7 |S|, for all a \u2208 A. \u2022 A reward vector r of dimension |S| \u00d7 |A| and > 0. This is the standard format of the input that is widely used for solving the MDP [Ber95, BT95, Put14, Ber13]. For Standard MDP, we establish the following lower bound on the running time of any (possibly randomized) algorithm.\nTheorem 1. For \u2264 \u03b34(1\u2212\u03b3) , any randomized algorithm for Standard MDP needs a running time at least \u2126(|S|2|A|) to compute an -optimal policy with probability at least 9/10.\nIn Theorem 1, the condition \u2264 \u03b34(1\u2212\u03b3) \u2248 14(1\u2212\u03b3) essentially indicates a constant multiplicative approximation ratio that is close to 1/4, because v\u03c0 is typically on the order of 11\u2212\u03b3 . It says that, in order to get a reasonable approximate policy, the running time is at least linear with respect to the input size O(|S|2|A|). This lower bound might seems quite intuitive, however, the formal proof requires the use of Yao\u2019s minimax principal and careful analysis of the tree program associated with any algorithm. The result of Theorem 1 excludes the possibility of the existence of any sublinear running-time algorithm for standard MDP.\nSecond we consider the case where transition probabilities of MDP are implicitly given in the format of cumulative probabilities (assuming that the states are ordered in some way).We define CDP MDP as follows.\nDefinition 2 (MDP Specified Using Cumulative Probabilities). The input of CDP MDP includes:\n\u2022 Matrices of cumulative probabilities Ca of dimension |S| \u00d7 |S|, for all a \u2208 A, where Ca(i, j) =\u2211j k=1 Pa(i, k) for all i \u2208 S, a \u2208 A and j \u2208 S.\n\u2022 A reward vector r of dimension |S| \u00d7 |A| and > 0.\nThe following theorems concerns the lower bound for solving CDP MDP .\nTheorem 2. For \u2265 3/|S|, any algorithm for CDP MDP needs at least \u2126 ( |S||A| ) running time to compute an \u03b34(1\u2212\u03b3) -optimal policy with probability at least 9/10.\nAccording to Theorem 2, the running time needed to compute an -optimal policy with probability at least 9/10 is \u2126 ( |S||A|\u03b3 (1\u2212\u03b3) ) as long as \u2265 3\u03b34|S|(1\u2212\u03b3) . Note that this is a weaker lower bound than that of Theorem 1. It does not exclude the existence of sublinear-time approximation algorithms. Third, we consider the case when the transition probabilities are given explicitly but are in the format of binary trees rather than arrays. We define the computation problem as follows.\nDefinition 3 (MDP Specified Using Binary Trees). The input of Binary Tree MDP includes:\n\u2022 Transition probability distributions Pa(i, \u00b7) that are encoded in binary trees. There are |S||A| trees, one for each state-action pair (i, a) \u2208 S \u00d7 A. Each binary tree has log |A| layers and |S| leaves that store the values of Pa(i, j), j \u2208 S. Each inner node of the tree stores the sum of its two children.\n\u2022 A reward vector r of dimension |S| \u00d7 |A| and > 0.\nWe have the following computational complexity lower bound for solving Binary Tree MDP.\nTheorem 3. Any algorithm for Binary Tree MDP needs at least \u2126 ( |S||A| ) running time to produce an\n\u03b3 4(1\u2212\u03b3) -optimal policy with probability at least 9/10 for larger than 3/|S|.\nThe results of Theorems 2, 3 are similar. They suggest that the MDP becomes easier to solve when the input is given in specific formats. They provide a hint that one might be able to develop faster algorithms to exploit the structures of the input. One may wonder what is common to CDP MDP and Binary Tree MDP? The answer is quite interesting: both the input of CDP MDP and Binary Tree MDP allow immediate simulation of the Markov decision process without preprocessing [WE80].\nIn contrast, given the input of Standard MDP, one needs O(|S|2|A|) running time to preprocess the arrays of transition probabilities in order to sample state-to-state transitions. This observation is consistent with the results of [Wan17] in which the upper bound reduces if the MDP input is given in a nice format that allows immediate sampling of state transitions. We conjecture that, once the Markov chain can be simulated, the MDP becomes easier to solve. This further implies a close connection between the running-time complexity of the MDP and the sample complexity of the associated reinforcement learning problem. This conjecture awaits further research."}, {"heading": "4 Family of Hard Instances of MDP", "text": "In this section, we take a substantial step towards establishing the lower bound of computational complexity for the MDP. Let > 0 be an arbitrary value. We will construct two disjoint sets of MDP instances that are close to each other. For any algorithm, the failure to distinguish one set from the other would result in a computation error at least .\n4.1 Hard Instances of Standard MDP\nLet the state space S consist of four parts, S = SU \u222a SG \u2229 SB \u222a {sN}, where |SU| = |SG| = |SB| = |S|\u221213 and sN is a single state. Let the action space be A = AU \u222a {aN} where |AU | = |A| \u2212 1 and aN is a single action. We construct two sets of MDP instances M1 and M2 that are hard to distinguish, which are given below:\n\u2022 LetM1 be the set of instances satisfying the following. If we select any action a \u2208 A in state s \u2208 SG,SB or sN, the state s transitions to itself with a reward 1, 0 or 1/2. Intuitively, SG, SB and sN are the good, bad and neutral states with high, low and median rewards. Given a \u2208 AU and s \u2208 SU, the system transitions to some s\u2032 \u2208 SB with probability 1 and reward 0. Given aN and s \u2208 SU, the state transitions to sN with reward 0. For M1 \u2208 M1, we have v\u2217M1(s) = \u03b3 2(1\u2212\u03b3) for all s \u2208 SU. The\ncardinality of M1 is |SB||SU\u00d7AU |. \u2022 LetM2 be the set of instances that differ from those inM1 at one state-action pair, which we denote\nby (s\u0304, a\u0304) \u2208 SU \u00d7AU . Given (s\u0304, a\u0304), the system transitions to some good state s\u0304\u2032 \u2208 SG with probability 1 and reward 0. For M2 \u2208 M2, we have v\u2217M2(s\u0304) = \u03b3 1\u2212\u03b3 and v \u2217 M2\n(s) = \u03b32(1\u2212\u03b3) for all s \u2208 SU/{s\u0304}. The cardinality of M2 is |SU \u00d7AU | \u00d7 |SB||SU\u00d7AU |.\nFigure 1 shows a pair of M1 \u2208M1 and M2 \u2208M2 which differ in two entries. We see that \u2016v\u2217M1 \u2212 v\u2217M2\u2016\u221e = \u03b3 2(1\u2212\u03b3) . Suppose that an algorithm can output a \u03b3\n4(1\u2212\u03b3) -optimal policy with high probability for all instances of the MDP. The algorithm must be able to differentiate M1 from M2 with high probability. Informally speaking, the algorithm needs to search for two discrepancies in an array of size |SU\u00d7AU \u00d7S| = \u2126(|S|2|A|). Intuitively, it needs to query a significant portion of the entire array to succeed with high probability, which requires a running time of \u2126(|S|2|A|).\n4.2 Hard Instances of CDP MDP and Binary Tree MDP\nLet > 3/|S| be arbitrary such that 1/ is an integer and let k = (|S|\u22121)/3. We arrange the good states and the bad states in an alternating order, i.e., sB,1, sG,1, . . . , sB,k, sG,k. Let us construct two sets of instances\nM3 and M4 that are hard to distinguish: \u2022 Let M3 consist of a single instance M3 satisfying the follows. If we select action a \u2208 AU in state s \u2208 SU, the system transitions to sB,1, . . . , sB,1/ each with probability and reward 0. From any s \u2208 SG,SB, sN, the system transitions to itself with a reward of 1, 0, /2 respectively, regardless of the action. If we select action aN at state s \u2208 SU, it transitions to sN with probability 1 and reward 0. We have v\u2217M3(s) = \u03b3/(2\u2212 2\u03b3) for s \u2208 SU.\n\u2022 We let M4 be the set of instances that differ from M3 by one entry. Let there be some state-action pair (s\u0304, a\u0304) \u2208 SU\u00d7AU that transitions to one of the first 1/ good state with probability and a reward of 0. For simplicity, we assume that 1/ is an integer. Let all other transition probabilities be identical to M3. There are |SU \u00d7 AU | \u00d7 1/ such instances. For M4 \u2208 M4, we have v\u2217M4(s\u0304) = \u03b3/(1 \u2212 \u03b3) and v\u2217M4(s) = \u03b3/(2\u2212 2\u03b3) for all s \u2208 SU/{s\u0304}.\nWe see that \u2016v\u2217M3\u2212v\u2217M4\u2016\u221e = \u03b3 2(1\u2212\u03b3) . For any algorithm that outputs an \u03b3/(4\u22124\u03b3)-optimal policy, it should be able to differentiate M4 from M3. In the case of CDP MDP , differentiating M4 from M3 requires one to search for one single discrepancy in an array of size |SU \u00d7AU \u00d7 1 | = \u2126(|S||A|/ ); see Figure 2. In the case of BinaryTreeMDP, differentiating M4 from M3 requires one to search for two discrepancies from \u2126(|S||A|/ ) leaves; see Figure 3."}, {"heading": "5 Proof of Main Theorems", "text": "In this section, we begin by introducing a sub-problem about differentiating matrices and establish its complexity lower bound. Then we develop the proofs of the main theorems by using Yao\u2019s minimax principal."}, {"heading": "5.1 A Sub-Problem", "text": "To facilitate our proof, we first introduce a sub-problem and give a lemma that is vital to the proof of Theorem 1.\nDefinition 4 (Matrix Differentiation). Let A and B be two m by n matrices taking values of 0 or 1. For every row of A, there is an entry of 1 and the other entries are 0. B is similar to A except that there is a row with all zeros. We say that (A,B) is a \u201cpair of matrices\u201d if A and B differ by exactly one entry. Note that there are mnm pairs of matrices in total. We focus on deterministic algorithms that take the m \u00d7 n binary matrix as the input. For any pair (A,B), we say that a deterministic algorithm is able to distinguish A from B if it queries the entry (i, j) where Aij 6= Bij within a given number of steps when either A or B is given as the input.\nLemma 1. For any deterministic algorithm that applies to Matrix Differentiation, it needs \u2126(mn) queries to distinguish 3mnm/5 pairs of matrices.\nIn order to prove Lemma 1, we model any deterministic algorithm for the matrix differentiation problem as a tree program (which was used in [BFK+81] to study the complexity of sorting). As the algorithm makes a new query to the input matrix, the state of the algorithm branches according to the response until the maximal number of queries is reached. The proof is given in the appendix."}, {"heading": "5.2 Proof of Theorem 1", "text": "Let us summarize the main arguments of the proof: Suppose that some randomized algorithm can find an -optimal policy to the MDP with high probability within a time limit. Then by using Yao\u2019s minimax principal, we obtain that there exists a deterministic algorithm that is able to successfully distinguish a large number of hard instances inM1 from those inM2. It follows that one can construct an algorithm for Matrix Differentiation and apply Lemma 1 to establish the lower bound. The proof has a similar spirit as that of the relational adversary method [Amb00, Aar06]. Proof of Theorem 1. Given the state space S, the action space A and the discount factor \u03b3, we denote M0 to be the set of the MDP instances where the entries of P and r are multiples of 0.01. Note that M1 and M2 are two subsets of M0. Let \u03a0T be the set of all the deterministic algorithms that takes M0 \u2208 M0 as input and run at most T steps (each step is an query of an entry). Let \u00b5 be a distribution on \u03a0T and let D be a distribution on M0. Recall that a randomized algorithm running at most T steps is a distribution on \u03a0T . Theorem 1 can be equivalently stated as: If\nmax \u00b5\u2208P(\u03a0T ) min M0\u2208M0 P\u03c0\u223c\u00b5(M0) ( max s\u2208S \u2223\u2223v\u03c0M0(s)\u2212 v\u2217M0(s) \u2223\u2223 \u2264 ) \u2265 9/10, (2)\nthen T = \u2126(|S|2|A|) where P(\u03a0T ) is the set of all probability measures on \u03a0T and \u03c0 is the policy computed by the randomized algorithm \u00b5 on input M0. If (2) holds, we apply Yao\u2019s minimax principle [Yao77] and get\nmin D\u2208P(M0) max \u00b5\u2208\u03a0T PM0\u223cD ( max s\u2208S \u2223\u2223v\u03c0M0(s)\u2212 v\u2217M0(s) \u2223\u2223 \u2264 ) \u2265 9/10, (3)\nwhere \u03c0 is the policy computed by \u00b5 on input M0. The advantage of using Yao\u2019s minimax principle is that we have converted the complexity of randomized algorithms into the complexity of deterministic algorithms on randomized input.\nNow let D1 and D2 be the uniform distributions over M1 and M2 respectively. Let D be an equal mixture of D1 and D2. Assume that there exists a deterministic algorithm \u00b5 which outputs an -optimal policy with probability 9/10 when the MDP instance is drawn from D. As a result, \u00b5 must succeed with probability at least 4/5 if the instance is drawn from either D1 or D2 alone. Let C1 \u2282M1 and C2 \u2282M2 be the sets of instances on which \u00b5 succeeds. Let m = |SU \u00d7AU | and n = |SB|. By the discussion in Section 4, we have\n|C1| \u2265 4\n5 |M1| =\n4 5 nm, |C2| \u2265 4 5 |M2| = 4 5 mnm.\nFor instances M1 \u2208 M1 and M2 \u2208 M2, we say that (M1,M2) is a pair of MDP instances if the following two conditions are satisfied: (i) The transition probabilities of M1 and M2 differ at only two entries, (s\u0304, a\u0304, s\n\u2032) and (s\u0304, a\u0304, s\u0304\u2032). (ii) s\u2032 and s\u0304\u2032 have the same index within SB and SG (e.g., s\u2032 = sB,1 and s\u0304\u2032 = sG,1).\nConsider the graph where nodes are MDP instances and there is an edge between every \u201cpair\u201d. We can see that each M1 \u2208M1 has degree m and each M2 \u2208M2 has degree 1. Let e(\u00b7, \u00b7) be the indicator function where e(M1,M2) = 1 if (M1,M2) is a pair (so there is an edge) and 0 otherwise. The total number of pairs between C1 and C2 is\n\u2211\nM1\u2208C1,M2\u2208C2 e(M1,M2)\n\u2265 \u2211\nM1\u2208C1,M2\u2208M2 e(M1,M2)\u2212\n\u2211\nM1\u2208M1,M2\u2208M2\\C2 e(M1,M2)\n\u22654 5 nm \u00d7m\u2212 1 5 mnm = 3 5 mnm.\nIt means that the deterministic algorithm \u00b5 must be able to distinguish at least 3mnm/5 pairs of MDP instances.\nIn what follows, we use \u00b5 to construct an algorithm that applies to Matrix Differentiation. We first construct an auxiliary algorithm \u00b5\u2032 that mimics the work flow of \u00b5 with a slight difference. Suppose that \u00b5 queries an entry (s, a, s\u2032). If s\u2032 is a bad states, \u00b5\u2032 will query (s, a, s\u2032) and branch in the same way as if \u00b5 queries the entry (s, a, s\u2032) and branches. If s\u2032 is a good state, \u00b5\u2032 will also query (s, a, s\u2032), but regardless of the value of (s, a, s\u2032), \u00b5\u2032 will branch in the way that \u00b5 branches after reading a value 0 at (s, a, s\u2032). The algorithm \u00b5\u2032 outputs all the actual values of queries it read along the computation path.\nWe claim that \u00b5\u2032 is able to differentiate all the pairs that \u00b5 differentiate. Let (M1,M2) be a pair of MDP instances which can be differentiated by \u00b5. Suppose that we run both \u00b5 and \u00b5\u2032 on M1 (or M2). Let (s\u0304, a\u0304, s\u0304\u2032) be the entry on which M1 and M2 differ - this entry is eventually queried by \u00b5. Let (s, a, s\n\u2032) be any previous query made by \u00b5. If s\u2032 is a good state, then the value of (s, a, s\u2032) for both M1 and M2 must be 0 (according to the construction of M1,M2 in Section 4.1). Therefore \u00b5\n\u2032 will always mimic the moves of \u00b5 until it queries the right entry to differentiate M1 from M2. As a result, \u00b5\n\u2032 can distinguish all the pairs that \u00b5 distinguishes in T steps. Now let us we construct an algorithm based on \u00b5\u2032 that applies to Matrix Differentiation, which is given in Algorithm 1.\nAlgorithm 1 The algorithm constructed from \u00b5\u2032 that applies to Matrix Differentiation\n1: Input: An m\u00d7 n matrix A. 2: Set |SU|, |SB|, |SG| and |AU | such that m = |SU \u00d7AU | and n = |SG| = |SB|. 3: while \u00b5\u2032 hasn\u2019t terminated do 4: Let (s, a, s\u2032) be the entry to be queried by \u00b5\u2032 5: Let i be the index of (s, a) in SU \u00d7AU 6: if s\u2032 \u2208 SB then 7: Query Aij where j is the index of s\n\u2032 in SB 8: else if s\u2032 \u2208 SG then 9: Query Aij where j is the index of s\n\u2032 in SG 10: end if 11: Return Aij to answer the query of \u00b5 \u2032 12: end while\nWe claim that Algorithm 1 can distinguish at least 3mnm/5 pairs of matrices for Matrix Differentiation. Given a pair (M1,M2) \u2208 M1 \u00d7M2, we denote the subarray of transition probabilities corresponding to (SU \u00d7 A) \u00d7 SB as the matrix A and the matrix B. Note that A differs from B at a single entry, so (A,B) is a pair of Matrix Differentiation. Due to the definition for pairs of MDP instances (condition (ii)), we can verify that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of pairs of matrices for Matrix\nDifferentiation and the set of pairs of MDP instances. For each pair (M1,M2) that \u00b5 \u2032 distinguishes, \u00b5\u2032 queries an entry (s, a, s\u2032) on which M1 and M2 differ. Because of condition(ii), Algorithm 1 will query the corresponding entry (i, j) on which A and B differ. Since \u00b5\u2032 differentiate 3mnm/5 pairs of MDP instances in running time T , Algorithm 1 must be able to differentiate 3mnm/5 pairs of matrices for Matrix Differentiation using T queries. Finally, we apply Lemma 1 and obtain T = \u2126(|S|2|A|)."}, {"heading": "5.3 Proofs of Theorem 2 and 3", "text": "The proofs of Theorems 2 and 3 are significantly simpler than that of Theorem 1. This is because M3 and M4 differs in one single entry. The following proofs do not rely on Lemma 1. Proof of Theorem 2. Using similar notations as in Section 5.2, we restate Theorem 2 as: If\nmax \u00b5\u2208D(\u03a0T ) min M0\u2208M0 P\u03c0\u223c\u00b5(M0) ( max s\u2208S \u2223\u2223v\u03c0M0(s)\u2212 v\u2217M0(s) \u2223\u2223 \u2264 ) \u2265 9/10,\nthen T = \u2126(|S||A|/ ), where \u03a0T is the set of all the deterministic algorithms for CDP MDP . We apply the minimax principal similarly as in Section 5.2.\nLet D3,D4 be the uniform distributions overM3,M4 respectively. Let D be an equal mixture of D3 and D4. We say that M3 \u2208 M3 and M4 \u2208 M4 is a pair if M3 and M4 differs by exactly one entry. Note that |M3| = 1 and there are |S||A|/ pairs in total.\nSuppose that there is a deterministic algorithm \u00b5 that finds an \u03b34\u22124\u03b3 -optimal policy with probability at least 9/10, it must succeed (finds the optimal action) on M3 and on 4/5 of all instances in M4. It means that the algorithm \u00b5 must be able to distinguish at least 4/5\u00d7|S||A|/ pairs. When \u00b5 queries a new entry, it distinguishes one more pair of (M3,M4) that happen to only differ at this entry. The goal is to to distinguish at least 4/5 \u00b7 |S||A|/ pairs. Therefore, \u00b5 makes at least \u2126(|S||A|/ ) queries and its running time is lower bounded by \u2126(|S||A|/ ). Proof of Theorem 3. The proof of Theorem 3 is very similar to the proof of Theorem 2. The intuition is that for any pair (M3,M4), the binary tree representations of M3 and M4 are exactly the same except for two leaves. In order to find these two leaves or to be certain that such leaves do not exist, we need to query at least \u2126(|S||A|/ ) leaves. We omit the details for brevity."}, {"heading": "A Proof of Lemma 1", "text": "Computational Model: We model the deterministic algorithm solving Matrix Differentiation by a tree program. A tree program of length n is a directed tree with n + 1 layers, where each layer represents a time step. Each node of the tree represents a state of the algorithm that leads to a query of one entry of the input, whose edges correspond to the possible responses to the query. Given an input, the query at the root is first tested, and the state of the algorithm moves following the edge given by the response to the query. This leads to the second query, the position of which is decided by the deterministic algroithm and the response of the first query. The query continues until it reaches the leaf of the tree.\nFor Matrix Differentiation, the entries of the inputs only take value of 0 or 1. Thus, every node has exactly two outgoing edges to the next layer. We assume that the edge to the left child corresponds to the response of 0 and the edge to the right child corresponds to the response of 1. Each inner node in the tree is associated with a tuple (i, j), which is the entry to be queried at that node.\nBefore giving the proof, we give a few more definitions. For any input, the corresponding computation path is the sequence of nodes visited by the algorithm until termination. We define the i-th slice of the tree program to be the set of all the nodes to which the path has i \u2212 1 edges labelled by 1. Recall that input matrices A and B are a pair if and only if A and B differs by exactly one entry. We say that a node distinguishes the pair (A,B) if the node is on the computation paths of both A and B and Aij 6= Bij where (i, j) is the entry to be queried at that node.\nWe are ready to introduce the auxillary lemmas that establish the properties of the tree programs for any deterministic algorithm solving the Matrix Differentiation. Without loss of generality, we assume that the algorithm won\u2019t query the same entry two times in a single computation path. We have the following lemmas.\nLemma 2. Any single node at the k-th slice can distinguish at most nm\u2212k pairs.\nProof. Suppose that a node at the k-th slice distinguishes a pair (A,B). It means that the node is on the computation paths of both A and B, and the responses to the previous queries on the path are the same given either A or B as the input. Observe that the responses of k\u2212 1 of previous queries are 1, which means that the algorithm knows at least k \u2212 1 fixed rows of A and B. Now if Aij 6= Bij where (i, j) is the query of the current node, the i-th row of A and B is also fixed and the positions of unknown ones are only in the remaining m \u2212 k rows. The total number of possible configurations of these rows is at most nm\u2212k. As a result, any single node at the k-th slice can distinguish at most nm\u2212k pairs.\nLemma 3. The nodes at the k-th slice can distinguish at most nm pairs in total.\nProof. Let (A,B) be any pair of the input where all the rows of A have a 1. We want to count the number of pairs involving A that is distinguished at the k-th slice. We claim that if the computation path of A doesn\u2019t reach the (k + 1)-th slice, then none of the pairs involving A will be distinguished at the k-th slice. Suppose that the computation path doesn\u2019t reach the k-th slice. It is obvious that none of such pairs will be distinguished at k-th slice. If the computation path reaches the k-th slice and stays on it, then all the responses at the k-th slice are 0. Yet, if the tree program distinguishes a pair (A,B) at the k-th slice, it must query an entry (i, j) where Aij = 1 and Bij = 0. As a result, if there exists a pair involving A that is distinguished at the k-th slice, the computation path of A must reach the (k + 1)-th slice.\nAssume that the computation path of A reaches the (k+ 1)-th slice. We can see that the path will reach (k + 1)-th slice from some node. Denote (i, j) to be the entry queried at that node. Observe that the node can distinguish only one pair (A,B) of all the m pairs involving A as there is only one possible B such that Aij 6= Bij . It means that for every possible A, the tree program distinguish at most one pair involving A at the k-th slice. As there are at most nm configurations of A, the tree program can distinguish at most nm pairs at the k-th slice.\nThe intuition of Lemma 3 is that whenever we observe one more \u201c1\u201d in a query, the algorithm can distinguish at most nm more pairs. Now, we give our third lemma.\nLemma 4. Let L \u2265 m be the number of layers of the tree program. Then the total number of nodes at the k-th slice is less than or equal to ( L k ) .\nProof. Each node at the k-th slice is uniquely identified by the path from the root to the node, which can be represented by a sequence of numbers (a1, a2, . . . , ak). Here, ai is the number of nodes on the path which belongs to the i-th slice. The number of possible paths is at most the number of integer solution to the equation \u2211k i=1 ai \u2264 L. We introduce a slack variable \u03b1 so that \u03b1 + \u2211k i=1 ai = L + 1 where\n\u03b1 \u2265 1, a1 \u2265 1, . . . , ak \u2265 1. It is easy to see that the number of solutions is ( L k ) .\nThe above three lemmas establish the properties of the tree program for the Matrix Differentiation. We are now ready to prove the main lemma.\nProof of Lemma 1. Assume that we have a deterministic algorithm that distinguishes at least 3mn5/5 pairs in nk time steps, where k is an integer smaller than m/5. We first construct the tree program of the deterministic algorithm. We divide the tree into two parts, where the first part is the first 5k slices and the second part is the remaining m \u2212 5k slices. By Lemma 3, the tree program can distinguish at most 5knm pairs in the first 5k slices. We then bound the number of pairs which the tree can distinguish in the remaining slices. In the i-th slice, there are at most ( nk i ) nodes by Lemma 4. By Lemma 2, each node can\ndistinguish at most nm\u2212i pairs. As a result, the tree program can distinguish at most ( nk i ) nm\u2212i pairs at i-th slice for i > 5k. The total number of pairs we can distinguish in the remaining slices is then\nm\u2211\ni=5k+1\n( nk\ni\n) nm\u2212i \u2264 m\u2211\ni=5k\n( nk\ni\n) nm\u2212i \u2264 m\u2211\ni=5k\n(nk)i\ni! nm\u2212i = nm\nm\u2211\ni=5k\nki i! .\nBy Taylor\u2019s remainder theorem, we have\nm\u2211\ni=5k\nki\ni! \u2264 f\n(5k)(k) (5k)! k5k = ekk5k (5k)! ,\nwhere f(k) = ek. By using Stirling\u2019s formula where (5k)! \u2265 \u221a 2\u03c0(5k)5k+1/2e\u22125k, we have the following\nnm m\u2211\ni=5k\nki\ni! \u2264 n mekk5k\u221a 2\u03c0(5k)5k+1/2e\u22125k\n\u2264 nm ( e6/5k\n5k\n)5k \u2264 nm.\nAs a result, the total number of pairs we can distinguish is smaller than (5k + 1)nm when the layer of the tree program is nk. In order to distinguish at least 3mn5/5 pairs, the number of layers of the tree program should be \u2126(mn)."}], "references": [{"title": "Lower bounds for local search by quantum arguments", "author": ["Scott Aaronson"], "venue": "SIAM Journal on Computing,", "citeRegEx": "Aaronson.,? \\Q2006\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Aaronson.", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Quantum lower bounds by quantum arguments", "author": ["Andris Ambainis"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the thirty-second annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,", "citeRegEx": "Ambainis.,? \\Q2000\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Ambainis.", "year": 2000}, {"title": "On the sample complexity of reinforcement learning with a generative model", "author": ["Mohammad Gheshlaghi Azar", "R\u00e9mi Munos", "Bert Kappen"], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1206.6461,", "citeRegEx": "Azar et al\\.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Azar et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Dynamic Programming", "author": ["Richard Bellman"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Bellman.,? \\Q1957\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bellman.", "year": 1957}, {"title": "Dynamic programming and optimal control, volume 1", "author": ["Dimitri P Bertsekas"], "venue": "Athena Scientific,", "citeRegEx": "Bertsekas.,? \\Q1995\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bertsekas.", "year": 1995}, {"title": "Abstract dynamic programming", "author": ["Dimitri P Bertsekas"], "venue": "Athena Scientific,", "citeRegEx": "Bertsekas.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bertsekas.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "A time-space tradeoff for sorting on non-oblivious machines", "author": ["Allan Borodin", "Michael J Fischer", "David G Kirkpatrick", "Nancy A Lynch", "Martin Tompa"], "venue": "Journal of Computer and System Sciences,", "citeRegEx": "Borodin et al\\.,? \\Q1981\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Borodin et al\\.", "year": 1981}, {"title": "A time-space tradeoff for element distinctness", "author": ["Allan Borodin", "Faith Fich", "Friedhelm Meyer auf der Heide", "Eli Upfal", "Avi Wigderson"], "venue": "SIAM Journal on Computing,", "citeRegEx": "Borodin et al\\.,? \\Q1987\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Borodin et al\\.", "year": 1987}, {"title": "Neuro-dynamic programming: an overview", "author": ["Dimitri P Bertsekas", "John N Tsitsiklis"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 34th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,", "citeRegEx": "Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis.,? \\Q1995\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis.", "year": 1995}, {"title": "A survey of computational complexity results in systems and control", "author": ["Vincent D Blondel", "John N Tsitsiklis"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Blondel and Tsitsiklis.,? \\Q2000\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Blondel and Tsitsiklis.", "year": 2000}, {"title": "Sublinear optimization for machine learning", "author": ["Kenneth L Clarkson", "Elad Hazan", "David P Woodruff"], "venue": "Journal of the ACM (JACM),", "citeRegEx": "Clarkson et al\\.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Clarkson et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "The complexity of dynamic programming", "author": ["Chef-Seng Chow", "John N Tsitsiklis"], "venue": "Journal of complexity,", "citeRegEx": "Chow and Tsitsiklis.,? \\Q1989\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Chow and Tsitsiklis.", "year": 1989}, {"title": "Sample complexity of episodic fixed-horizon reinforcement learning", "author": ["Christoph Dann", "Emma Brunskill"], "venue": "In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,", "citeRegEx": "Dann and Brunskill.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Dann and Brunskill.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Pac bounds for multi-armed bandit and Markov decision processes", "author": ["Eyal Even-Dar", "Shie Mannor", "Yishay Mansour"], "venue": "In International Conference on Computational Learning Theory,", "citeRegEx": "Even.Dar et al\\.,? \\Q2002\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Even.Dar et al\\.", "year": 2002}, {"title": "The value iteration algorithm is not strongly polynomial for discounted dynamic programming", "author": ["Eugene A Feinberg", "Jefferson Huang"], "venue": "Operations Research Letters,", "citeRegEx": "Feinberg and Huang.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Feinberg and Huang.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Subexponential lower bounds for randomized pivoting rules for the simplex algorithm", "author": ["Oliver Friedmann", "Thomas Dueholm Hansen", "Uri Zwick"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the forty-third annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing,", "citeRegEx": "Friedmann et al\\.,? \\Q2011\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Friedmann et al\\.", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Dynamic programming and Markov processes", "author": ["Ronald A.
