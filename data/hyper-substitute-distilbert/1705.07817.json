Graphical Lasso [3] is an efficient strategy to obtain a graph of interactions from the inverse covariance matrix but its limitation is to not being adapted for a specific task such as regression, which is the core of this contribution. To learn the interactions in the context of regression, additive sparse regression model has to be extended. Several work have been dedicated to this subject in a recent literature [1], [4], [5], [6], [7]. In this contribution we improve on these recent works by providing a common framework and an efficient minimization strategy based on epigraphical projection and primal-dual proximal algorithms.\nOne challenge for feature interaction learning is that the interaction number quadratically increases as the feature size, for example, 1000 features will have one million possible interactions, this therefore results into an overfitting problem due to insufficient observation samples in most situations. To overcome this weakness, the regression weights and the quadratic interactions can be assumed to be sparse such that most features would not contribute to the decision. Sparsity-based regularization is known to be mainly suitable when the feature size is larger than the training samples. Various sparsity regularizations have been proposed and extensively studied in the additive model, for instance, involving `0-pseudo-norm [8], `1-norm [9], `\u221e- norm [10], or structural sparsity norm [11].

The idea to integrate quadratic interactions in the learning problem including discrimination task is not new, for example, discriminant quadratic learning [13], [14] learns the covariance matrix in the quadratic term to improve the discrimination ability. However, the idea to learn covariance matrix combined with sparsity regularization is more recent with the preliminary work by Zhao et al. [4] and the following works [1], [5], [6], [7]. Formally, if we denote the regression training set R = {(y`,x`) \u2208 R \u00d7 RN | ` \u2208 {1, . . . , L}}, the criterion involved in sparse quadratic interactions learning takes the form\nminimize v\u2208RN ,\u0398\u2208RN\u00d7N\n1\n2 L\u2211 `=1 (y` \u2212 x>` v \u2212 x>` \u0398x`)2 + \u2126(v,\u0398) (1)\nwhere v = ( v(i) ) 1\u2264i\u2264N models the regression weight vector,\n\u0398 = ( \u0398(i,j) ) 1\u2264i\u2264N,1\u2264j\u2264N denotes the matrix of interactions, and \u2126(v,\u0398) is the regularization term including sparse regularization and other constraints such as hierarchy constraints.\nThe hierarchy constraints make the relationship between v and \u0398, as shown in Fig. 1. Two types of hierarchy constraints have been defined in \u201chierNet\u201d [1]: (i) weak hierarchy where the interactions happen (i.e., \u0398(i,j) 6= 0) if one of the associating main features in v is non-zero (i.e., v(i) 6= 0 or v(j) 6= 0) and (ii) strong hierarchy when both associating features are non-zero. Both regularizations can be written as\n\u2126(v,\u0398) = \u03bb\n2 \u2016\u0398\u20161 + \u03bb N\u2211 i=1 max{|v(i)|, \u2016\u0398(i,\u00b7)\u20161}+ \u03b9C(\u0398)\n(2) where the notation \u0398(i,\u00b7) = ( \u0398(i,j) ) 1\u2264j\u2264N and \u03b9C denotes the indicator function1 of a closed convex set C \u2282 RN\u00d7N that can either model an unconstrained problem C = RN\u00d7N\n1. For every x \u2208 H, \u03b9C(x) = 0 if x \u2208 C and +\u221e otherwise.\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n07 81\n7v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 3\nA ug\n2 01\n7\nor impose symmetric structure for matrix of interactions using C = S = {\u0398 \u2208 RN\u00d7N |\u0398 = \u0398>} for weak or strong hierarchy constraints, respectively. In [7], a more general framework is derived taking the form\n\u2126(v,\u0398) = \u03bb\n2 \u2016\u0398\u20161 + \u03bb N\u2211 i=1 \u2016 ( v(i), z ( \u0398(i,\u00b7) )) \u2016q + \u03b9C(\u0398) (3)\nwhere z : RN \u2192 R and 1 \u2264 q \u2264 +\u221e. The contribution on \u0398(i,\u00b7) w.r.t. v(i) can be (i) reduced to a `r-norm with r > 0 (i.e., z(\u00b7) = \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016r) or (ii) considered globally by keeping the information contained in all the interaction coefficients considering z(\u00b7) = (\u00b7)>. Most of the state-ofthe-art penalization may be interpreted as a specific case of this general setting, for instance:\n\u2022 [15] : z(\u00b7) = (\u00b7)>, q = {2,+\u221e}, \u2022 [1], [5] : z(\u00b7) = \u2016 \u00b7 \u20161 and q = +\u221e, \u2022 [7] : z(\u00b7) = (\u00b7)> and q = {2}.\nNote that [15] focus on weak hierarchy using C = RN\u00d7N . [1] is encountered under the name \u201chierNet\u201d, while [5] is named \u201cFAMILY\u201d and [7] is \u201cType-A GRESH\u201d. The latent overlapping group lasso formulation of [1] is known as \u201cglinternet\u201d [6].\nFrom the algorithmic point of view several strategies can be encountered. In [15] and [7], the iterations are derived from FISTA [16]. This procedure appears to be very efficient when C = RN\u00d7N while for C = S it requires inner iterations based on Dykstra algorithm that slower significantly the convergence [17]. On the other hand, [1] and [5] resort to ADMM to deal with C = S.\nUsing recent development of non-smooth convex optimization, the objective of this work is to provide a unified framework and an efficient algorithmic strategy based on primal-dual proximal algorithms and epigraphical projection to solve (2) when C = S, z(\u00b7) = \u2016\u00b7\u2016r with r = {1,+\u221e} and q = +\u221e, i.e.\n\u2126(v,\u0398) = \u03bb\n2 \u2016\u0398\u20161+\u03bb N\u2211 i=1 \u2016 ( v(i), \u2016\u0398(i,\u00b7)\u2016r ) \u2016\u221e+\u03b9C(\u0398). (4)\nThe algorithmic procedure does not resort to inner iterations leading to faster algorithmic procedure.2\nFollowing arguments provided in [1], Section 2 derives an equivalent writing of (4) using epigraphical formulation and recall the relationship with [15]. Section 3 presents the primal-dual proximal algorithm iterations and the convergence guarantees. Its specification for solving the minimization problem (1) with regularization function (4) is specified\n2. Matlab codes will be made available at the time of the publication.\nand new epigraphical projections are provided. Section 4 evaluates the performance of the proposed strategy compared to FISTA and ADMM formulations proposed in [1], [15] both on synthetic data and real data. Based on the new algorithmic procedure, fair comparisons between a penalization involving r = 1 or r = +\u221e can be provided. Finally Section 5 gives our conclusion."}, {"heading": "2 EPIGRAPHICAL FORMULATION", "text": "The minimization of (1) with the regularization term defined as in Eq. (4) is difficulty, since it involves non-smooth convex functions and symmetry constraint. In [15], Jenatton et al. solve the problem for r = \u221e in the weak hierarchy formulation by means of proximal algorithm. However, their algorithm is hardly adaptive to strong hierarchy. In [1], the authors reformulate (4) when r = 1 under an epigraphical formulation, which represents the problem as a set of hard constraints. This reformulation helps in the interpretation and it highlights that a reduction in the shrinkage of certain main effects and an increase in the shrinkage of certain interactions. Its second advantage is to help in the design of the ADMM algorithmic scheme. The merit of this formulation is to split the problem as a set of convex constraints, and it allows us to deal with them by computing their projection onto convex sets. The following proposition gives the epigraphical formulation of our minimization problem.\nProposition 1.

Let v = v+ \u2212 v\u2212, (6) can be equivalently written as\nminimize v,v+,v\u2212,\u0398\n1\n2 L\u2211 `=1 (y` \u2212 x>` v \u2212 x>` \u0398x`)2 + \u03bb\n2 \u2016\u0398\u20161 + \u03bb1>(2v+ \u2212 v)\nsubj. to  \u2016\u0398(i,\u00b7)\u2016r \u2264 2v+(i) \u2212 v(i) (\u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , N}) v = v+ \u2212 v\u2212\n(v+,v\u2212,\u0398) \u2208 O \u00d7O \u00d7 C.

Using |v(i)| = 2 max{0, v(i)} \u2212 v(i), we get the expected result:\nminimize v,\u0398\n1\n2 L\u2211 `=1 (y` \u2212 x>` v \u2212 x>` \u0398x`)2\n+ \u03bb\n2 \u2016\u0398\u20161 + \u03bb N\u2211 i=1 max{|v(i)|, \u2016\u0398(i,\u00b7)\u2016r}+ \u03b9C(\u0398).

FISTA can be presented as an accelerated version of forward-backward iterations [16], [19] while ADMM can be viewed as a Douglas-Rachford in the dual [20]. In the literature dedicated to sparse regression the most encountered algorithm is FISTA when dealing with a sum of two convex functions where one is differentiable with a Lipschitz gradient. When the criterion involves more than two functions, typically additional constraint such as the constraint S defined previously, most of the works derive an ADMM procedure or compute the proximity operator by mean of inner iterations which is known to often lead to an approximate solution even if global convergence can be obtained in specific cases [17]. Another class of algorithmic procedures allowing to minimize a criterion with more that two functions, possibly including a differentiable function with a Lipschitz gradient, is the class of primal-dual proximal approaches [21], [22], [23], [24].\nSeveral primal-dual proximal schemes have been derived but one of the most popular is based on forwardbackward iterations [23], [24] in order to estimate\nw\u0302 \u2208 Argmin w\u2208H f(w) + g(w) + h(Hw), (9)\nwhere H : H \u2192 G denotes a bounded linear operator, where H and G being two Hilbert spaces, f : H \u2192] \u2212 \u221e,+\u221e], g : H \u2192]\u2212\u221e,+\u221e] and h : G \u2192]\u2212\u221e,+\u221e] denote convex, l.s.c and proper functions. We additionally assume that f is differentiable with a Lipschitz constant denoted \u03b2 > 0.

We now focus on the computation of prox\u03c6(\u03c9 +, \u03c9\u2212).\nFirst, we sort (|u(i)|)1\u2264i\u2264N in ascending order to be (\u03bd(1), . . . , \u03bd(N)), such that |\u03bd(1)| \u2264 . . . \u2264 |\u03bd(N)|, and also \u03bd(0) = \u2212\u221e; and second n\u0304 \u2208 [1, N ] can be found such that\n\u03bd(n\u0304\u22121) \u2264 \u03b7+ + \u03b7\u2212 \u2264 \u03bd(n\u0304), then \u03c6(\u03c9+, \u03c9\u2212) = \u2211M i=n\u0304(\u03b7\n+ + \u03b7\u2212 \u2212 \u03bd(n\u0304))2, so the proximity operator of \u03c6 has: \u03bd(n\u0304\u22121) \u2264 \u03b7+ + \u03b7\u2212 \u2264 \u03bd(n\u0304), \u03c9+ \u2212 \u03b7+ = (N \u2212 n\u0304+ 1)(\u03b7+ + \u03b7\u2212)\u2212 \u2211N i=n\u0304 \u03bd (i),\n\u03c9\u2212 \u2212 \u03b7\u2212 = \u03c9+ \u2212 \u03b7+, (16)\nand that leads to{ \u03b7\u2212 = \u03c9\u2212\u2212(N\u2212n\u0304+1)(\u03c9+\u2212\u03c9\u2212)+ \u2211N i=n\u0304 \u03bd (i)\n1+2(N\u2212n\u0304+1) ,\n\u03b7+ = \u03b7\u2212 + \u03c9+ \u2212 \u03c9\u2212.

The projection of (\u03c9+, \u03c9\u2212,u) \u2208 R\u00d7 R\u00d7 RN on the epigraphic set E+1 reads\n(\u03b7+, \u03b7\u2212,p) = PE+1 (\u03c9+, \u03c9\u2212,u)\nwith  \u03b7\u2212 = \u2211n\u0303 i=1 \u00b5 (i)\u2212\u03c9++(n\u0303+1)\u03c9\u2212 n\u0303(1+2/n\u0303) \u03b7+ = \u03b7\u2212 + \u03c9+ \u2212 \u03c9\u2212 p = u\u2212max { 0, \u2211n\u0303 i=1 \u00b5\n(i)\u2212(\u03b7++\u03b7\u2212) n\u0303\n} (18)\nwith\nn\u0303 = max{n \u2208 {1, . . . , N} | \u00b5(n) \u2212 \u2211n i=1 \u00b5\n(i) \u2212 (\u03b7+ + \u03b7\u2212) n > 0} (19)\nand where \u00b5 = (\u00b5(i))1\u2264i\u2264N is an ordered version of u = (u(i))1\u2264i\u2264N in an descending order.\nProof. The Lagrangian associated to the function involved in PE+1 is:\nL(\u03b7+, \u03b7\u2212,p, \u03b1, \u03be) = 1 2 \u2016p\u2212 u\u20162 + 1 2 (\u03b7+ \u2212 \u03c9+)2\n+ 1\n2 (\u03b7\u2212 \u2212 \u03c9\u2212)2 + \u03b1 ( N\u2211 i=1 p(i) \u2212 \u03b7+ \u2212 \u03b7\u2212 ) \u2212 \u03be>p. (20)\nThe KKT conditions are: (\u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , N}) p(i) \u2212 u(i) + \u03b1\u2212 \u03bei = 0 \u03b7+ \u2212 \u03c9+ \u2212 \u03b1 = 0 \u03b7\u2212 \u2212 \u03c9\u2212 \u2212 \u03b1 = 0 (\u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , N}) \u03be(i)p(i) = 0\u2211N i=1 p (i) \u2212 \u03b7+ \u2212 \u03b7\u2212 = 0.\n(21)\nFrom the fourth condition in Eq. (21), we know that if p(i) > 0 then \u03be(i) = 0 and p(i) = u(i) \u2212 \u03b1. Thus, if we denote \u03c0 = (\u03c0(i))1\u2264i\u2264N is an ordered version of (p(i))1\u2264n\u2264N in a decreasing order, we can write\nN\u2211 i=1 p(i) = N\u2211 i=1 \u03c0(i) = n\u0303\u2211 i=1 \u03c0(i) = n\u0303\u2211 i=1 (\u00b5(i) \u2212 \u03b1) = \u03b7+ + \u03b7\u2212.\n(22) From similar arguments than in [26][Lemma 2] , n\u0303 is computed as (19) and thus\n\u03b1 = 1\nn\u0303 ( n\u0303\u2211 i=1 \u00b5(i) \u2212 (\u03b7+ + \u03b7\u2212) ) . (23)\nFrom the second and third equality of the KKT conditions, we have \u03b7+ = \u03b7\u2212 + \u03c9+ \u2212 \u03c9\u2212. Finally, combining (23) with \u03b7\u2212 = \u03c9\u2212 + \u03b1, yields to\n\u03b7\u2212 = 1\nn\u0303(1 + 2/n\u0303) ( n\u0303\u2211 i=1 \u00b5(i) \u2212 \u03c9+ + (n\u0303+ 1)\u03c9\u2212 ) . (24)\nNext we get the solution of PE1 from the ones of projection to E+1 according to [26][Lemma 3] and have the following proposition:\nProposition 4. The projection of (u+, u\u2212,w) \u2208 R \u00d7 R \u00d7 RN on the epigraphic set E1 reads\n(\u03b7+, \u03b7\u2212,p) = PE1(u +, u\u2212,w)\nwith { (v+, v\u2212, p\u0302) = PE+1 (u+, u\u2212, abs(w))\np = sign(w)p\u0302 (25)\nwhere abs(\u00b7) and sign(\u00b7) denote the componentwise absolute value and the componentwise sign.\nThis result can be directly derived from [26][Lemma 3] and the proof is therefore omitted here.\nIntegrating the projection derived in Proposition 2 into Algorithm 2 or Proposition 3 and Proposition 4 into Algorithm 3 with\nprox\u03c3\u03b9\u2217Er (u+, u\u2212,w) = (u+, u\u2212,w)\u2212 \u03c3PEr (u+ \u03c3 , u\u2212 \u03c3 , w \u03c3 ) insure the convergence to a minimizer of (6) and, from Proposition 1, to a minimizer of (5), respectively for weak hierarchy and strong hierarchy."}, {"heading": "4 EXPERIMENTS", "text": "In this section, we provide comparison results of both `1 and `\u221e proposed approaches with the two closest stateof-the-art procedures, that are \u201chierNet\u201d [1] and Jenatton\u2019s framework [15].

From the maximum strength and sum of strength for each gene in the Fig. 9, we can see the different properties for both algorithms. For \u201cStrongPD-`\u221e\u201d, maximum strength for each gene has a more sparse distribution than sum of strength, which is consistent with its objective that the maximum of absolute values of \u0398(i,:) is not larger that v(i), whereas a more sparse distribution over sum of strength is obtained for \u201cStrong-PD-`1\u201d, whose objective is to ensure that the sum of absolute values of \u0398(i,:) is not larger that v(i). From Fig. 7(right), it also can be observed that \u201cStrong-PD-`1\u201d is slightly better than \u201cStrongPD-`\u221e\u201d in that it imposes a stronger penalization for \u0398 than \u201cStrong-PD-`\u221e\u201d."}, {"heading": "5 CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we propose a primal-dual proximal algorithm based on epigraphical projection to optimize the sparse regression learning problem when hierarchical constraints are made between the main effects and the interactions. Four algorithms are derived (\u201cWeak-PD-`\u221e\u201d , \u201cWeak-PD`1\u201d , \u201cStrong-PD-`\u221e\u201d , \u201cStrong-PD-`1\u201d) allowing to deal and compare properly different configurations of the regularization term (4). Compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, for instance, FISTA or ADMM, the proposed algorithm is computationally more efficient (find a solution belonging to S, convergence in terms of iterates is faster). The experiments on the synthetic and real data validate its effectiveness and efficiency."}], "references": [{"title": "A lasso for hierarchical interactions", "author": ["J. Bien", "J. Taylor", "R.

The experiments are conducted both on the synthetic and real data, and they clearly show that the proposed primal-dual proximal algorithm based on epigraphical projection is efficient and effective to solve and investigate the question of the hierarchical interaction learning problem.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
