In various subjects, such as physics, chemistry, and finance, there exist relationships between various parameters. These relationships can be discovered by proofs, conjecture, or approximated using assumptions via the scientific method. The scientific method has been the mainstay of understanding the laws that govern the universe. The method is based on observations that provide data in order to develop theories to predict future observations. It often starts with a mathematical hypothesis which is then verified by seeing how well the observed data fits a hypothesized model. However, the scientific method is rarely applied in the converse, formulating a plausible mathematical hypothesis using data. Algorithms are developed to autonomously discover these relationships using sets of data alone, organized into input and output data. This is accomplished by proposing a series of candidate equations, plugging in the values of the data set into each equation, and determining how well the data fits each equation, typically using least squared methods. Notable progress has been made in applying different approaches [2].\nDespite the progresses, challenges still exist. One problem with existing approaches is that without any assumptions on the relationship\u2019s format, arriving at the desired candidate equation is computationally slow. To address this, there are various algorithms that enumerate through these candidates. These algorithms must use some method of quantifying equation complexity in order to organize its enumeration and ensure every candidate equation of that complexity is written. One such method is the representation of an equation as a tree, where the nodes represent operators, the leaves represent data, and the complexity calculated as the sum of nodes and leaves [3]. However, this still means that the number of candidates increases exponentially with respect to complexity, meaning any brute-force algorithm causes high complexity equations to take an unreasonable amount of time to reach and verify against the data [4].\nThe second problem is about constants. Many natural relationships have constants as part of their equations. An algorithm that enumerates through candidate equations does not take into account its constants. The Pareto frontier technique can be used to calculate these constants for the candidate equations. However, this method only gives you an approximation of the constants. In addition, this method does not explicitly rule out any candidate equations, as it accepts candidate equations and constants with a squared residual within a bound [3]. The sparsity of a given data set can also be used to bound the coefficients of the desired compact law [5]. To the knowledge of the authors, there is currently no algorithm that explicitly rejects candidate equations that cannot be fitted with constants to the data, and also explicitly finds constants that allow candidate equations to be fitted to the data.\nThe third problem is on narrowing down the enumeration for the candidate equations. Bruteforce methods lead to an unacceptable program run time [6]. To combat this, algorithms have employed genetic algorithms and neural networks to introduce speed-ups in the program. Genetic algorithms introduce slight mutations in a candidate equation to single out operators and constants that fit the data well [7]. Mutated equations that are promising, through some metric, generate equations with similar attributes, some with further mutations. This process is repeated until a candidate equation is found that can fit the data [8].\nTo combat the challenges, various approaches have been proposed. Machine learning based on the Neural Networks has shown its effective way in developing relationships using high through-\nput experimental data in novel ways [9]. It is recognized that, for many applications, it is far easier to train a system using desired input-output examples than enumerating rules to obtain the desired response. Although convergence to the desired input-output relationships can be achieved via intensive and extensive training, there are no methods to prove that these machine learning algorithms converge onto a natural law based on the data [10].\nA new and prospective area of data-driven discovery is the development of automated science. Automated science involves creating algorithms that analyze data sets in order to create compact laws governing that data. A compact law refers to mathematically explicit description or equation that exactly describes the data [11]. Among recent advances, one approach is based on statistical and model driven methods, for example, the use of Bayesian probabilistic methods and Markov models [12] as the basis of an intelligent system [13], and the expectation maximization algorithm, which converges to a maximum likelihood estimate based on incomplete data [14]. Linear algebraic methods are applied to this field in order to improve run time and ensure convergence to a compact law. One such method is the use of randomized algorithms to decompose and diagonalize sparse matrices. As a result, this can be used to approximate a time dependent system, such as the Maxwell equations, using a Markov model, and thus approximate a system\u2019s behavior over time [15]. In addition, the use of proper orthogonal decomposition on some sets of data can identify linearly dependent data sets to quickly classify bifurcation regimes in non-linear dynamical systems [16]. Further, a method of using a library of functions acting on a sparse vector of constants. The resulting linear equation is then evaluated according to the data. This method was used to re-derive the equations governing the chaotic Lorentz system and fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle [17]. However, this method relies on separating data into independent and dependent variables. The independent variables are used to construct the function library and generate the compact law governing the dependent variables. Not all data can be cleanly separated into dependent and independent variables, so a method of incorporating all variables into a compact law is needed.\nIn this paper, we develop an innovative approach in discovering compact laws. We propose a novel algebraic equation formulation such that constant determination and candidate equation verification can be explicitly solved with low computational time. The algebraic formulation allows us to represent the evolution of equation candidates in an explicit mathematical manner. We also derive general methods for searching through a family of candidate equations and verifying them with respect to the data. The searching algorithms are defined conventionally and using a finite field to improve running time. The assumption of our approach on the compact law is that it is in some general format and incorporates only constants and variables related to the provided data. There are no assumptions on the data. We show that there is guaranteed convergence toward a valid equation candidate. Thus, for a specific type of compact theory, the discovery can be computationally efficient and mathematically precise. The proposed approach may have implications in many fields of data science, such as re-deriving natural laws of Physics, speculating in finance, and modeling chaotic, non-linear systems.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, algebraic formulation is proposed for discovering equation candidates in a data set. An algorithm format to determine and verify if a candidate equation fits the data with respect to constants is presented. Proof of theorems for equation validation is shown in section 3. In section 4, search algorithms are proposed in finding candidate equations. We show the algorithm based on finite field sieve has improved performance over the exhaustive search algorithm. In section 5, numerical results are presented using the proposed approach to re-derive the van der Waals equation from raw data, followed by concluding remarks in section 6."}, {"heading": "2 Algebraic Formulation", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Virtual Experiment Setup", "text": "Suppose we are presented with some data set, which are the inputs and outputs of some number of experiments. However, we do not know what data are the inputs and outputs. For each category of the data, every data entry must correspond to an experiment. We can organize the data set in the format of a virtual experiment, as in a set of categories of data that relate to one another. Denote a set of n characters representing the categories of our inputs/outputs for the virtual experiment as\nF = {F1, . . . , Fn} (1)\nas the set of n characters representing the categories of our inputs/outputs. For example, consider a virtual experiment that allows us to re-derive the classical force laws. This experiment involves two particles on a plane, some distance apart. Particle one has mass, charge, and velocity, while the other is a fixed mass and charge. Both are in a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the plane. The set of input categories would be the masses of the two particles, m1,m2, the charges of the two particles, q1, q2, the distance between the two particles, r, the velocity of the first particle, v1, and the strength of the magnetic field, B. This is denoted as\nF = {m1,m2, q1, q2, r, v1, B, a}.\nAs a result, the data sets which we will fit our force law equations onto will be of the form\n{m1,t,m2,t, q1,t, q2,t, rt, v1,t, Bt, at}, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 r.\nThe data from the force law experiment may be separated into input and output categories. However, given a data set, we need not assume whether each data category is an input or an output to discover an equation that describes the data.

If A is square and invertible, we have A+A = I = AA+. As a result, (AA+ \u2212 I)~b = [0]~b = ~0. By theorem 1, the corresponding candidate equation is valid.\nCorollary 3. The equation (AA+ \u2212 I)~b = ~0 is valid if and only if 1.~b is the eigenvalue, eigenvector pair of matrix AA+.\nProof. Assume (AA+ \u2212 I)~b = ~0. As a result, since ~b 6= ~0 because of our equation candidate format, \u2016AA+ \u2212 I\u2016 = 0, and so ~b must be an eigenvector of AA+ \u2212 I. Assume ~b is an eigenvector of AA+ \u2212 I.

This is accomplished by solving n linear equations, at most p times, on at most n3s equation candidates. This takes n3s+1O(d2)p. This shows that |FFV \u2032| = k is approximately constant. We also must take into account that the exponents of those equation candidates in FFV \u2032 are in modulo p. For each exponent, there are p possible exponents because p \u2264 \u221a d.

The pressure P , volume V , and number of moles n for 20 different virtual experiments were generated randomly. The van der Waals coefficients a = 2.45\u00d710\u22122, b = 2.661\u00d710\u22125 were values for hydrogen, the gas constant R was set as 8.3145. For each experiment, the temperature T was calculated.

We searched in the family of algebraic equation candidates\nof additive size 5 and exponent order 5. The exhaustive search and finite field sieve methods were used to generate candidate equations and apply their respective search methods to find the valid equation candidates. For various valid and invalid candidates related to the van der Waals equation, the existence of the Moore-Penrose inverse and validity of the subsequent equation (AA+ \u2212 I)~b = 0 for each of their corresponding data matrices was verified in Julia. In determining the existence of the Moore-Penrose inverse, Gaussian elimination is applied to the matrix A\u2217A. In turning the matrix into row echelon form, if the algorithm detects a diagonal entry that is within some bound \u01eb = 0.0001 of zero, the matrix is determined to be not invertible. If all diagonal entries are outside that bound, the matrix is considered left invertible. The left Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse is calculated as (A\u2217A)\u22121A\u2217. (A\u2217A)\u22121 is calculated by performing the same Gauss-Jordan operations in reducing matrix A\u2217A to reduced row echelon form to the identity matrix.

In this approach, an algebraic model is derived to verify whether a certain algebraic equation fits the data set. With this model, we solve the problem of determining constants for equations with additive terms. We have also developed algorithms to parse through a family of algebraic equations, one by exhaustive search and the other based on the finite field sieve, which is more efficient. In addition, we prove that both algorithms are guaranteed to converge in finding an equation that describes a data set if the equation belongs to the family in which the algorithms are applied.\nThe devised algebraic equation verification algorithm runs in O(tr2) time. r is the number of experiments done, and t = max(dn, r), with d being the number of additive terms of the candidate, and m,n being the number of input and output variables in the data. We have proved that the question of equation validation with respect to constants is exactly the question of the existence of the pseudoinverse A+ and the calculation of (AA+ \u2212 I)~b (Theorem 1). A numerical method was devised to determine whether a pseudoinverse exists with respect to a bound. Another method was used to determine whether (AA+ \u2212 I)~b is within some bound of ~0 using squared residuals. This algorithm succeeded in validating the van der Waals equation and calculating its constants, while rejecting all other equation candidates. The exhaustive search algorithm runs in eO(1)rs time, where r is the number of experiments in the data and s is the maximum number of additive terms in the family of equations to be searched. The finite field sieve algorithm improves on our exhaustive search algorithm by converting our data into elements of a finite field to reduce the number of equations needed to be searched. This algorithm runs in eO(1) \u221a rs time, which makes the algorithm run in sub-exponential time with respect to the number of experiments. Both algorithms searched through the same family of algebraic equations relating to the van der Waals equation and converged on the valid equation.\nThe proposed approach transforms the problem of deriving meaning from data into formulating a linear algebra model and finding equations that fit the data. Such a formulation allows the finding of equation candidates in an explicit mathematical manner. For a certain type of compact theory, our approach assures convergence, with the discovery being computationally efficient\nand mathematically precise. However, several limitations exist. One is that not all natural laws are in algebraic form. For example, for an RLC circuit [24], which includes exponents, sinusoids, and complex numbers, applying our algorithms to data of this type would yield a Taylor approximation of the equation, which may not be accurate for larger values. Another lies in the fact that the Finite Field Sieve algorithm is still relatively slow due to it being exponential with respect to the maximum number of additive terms to be searched through. These problems may limit the algorithm\u2019s effectiveness on certain data sets. To improve this approach, further work includes finding a mathematical analogue of this process applicable to vectors. Currently, all vector algebraic equations must be found component-wise. In addition, applying certain transforms (e.g., Fourier or Laplace) on exponential, logarithmic, or sinusoidal equation candidates may expand the number of data types that can fit an equation.\nWe believe the most promising direction is determining a search algorithm based on linear algebra such that valid candidate equations can be discovered with high probability. This is due to the candidate equation evolution dependent on multiplication by diagonal matrices, which do not change a matrice\u2019s eigenvector space [25]. There are several potential search criterion that are worthy of study to use as a tool for supervised training. This may lead to a probabilistic algorithm that runs in polynomial time. This re-expression of the problem of derivation of natural laws from data into a linear algebra model creates enormous potential for refining constant evaluation, search, and learning algorithms."}, {"heading": "7 Materials", "text": "The Julia code is available with this pre-print on arXiv.
