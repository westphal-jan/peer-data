Introduction", "text": "Rough set theory, proposed by Pawlak in the early 1980s [11, 12], is a new mathematical tool to deal with vague concepts. Since then we have witnessed a systematic, world-wide growth of interest in rough set theory [1, 7, 13, 16, 26, 27, 28, 33, 34, 35, 37] and its applications [6, 14, 15, 29, 36, 39]. Nowadays, it turns out that this approach is of fundamental importance to artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences, especially in the areas of data mining, machine learning, decision analysis, knowledge management, expert systems, and pattern recognition.\nRough set theory bears on the assumption that some elements of a universe may be indiscernible in view of the available information about the elements. Thus, the indiscernibility relation is the starting point of rough set theory. Such a relation was first described by equivalence relation in the way that two elements are related by the relation if and only if they are indiscernible from each other. In this framework, a rough set is a formal approximation of a subset of the universe in terms of a pair of unions of equivalence classes which give the lower and upper approximations of the subset. However, the requirement of equivalence relation as the indiscernibility relation is too restrictive for many applications. In other words, many practical data sets cannot be handled well by classical rough sets. In light of this, equivalence relation has been generalized to similarity relation [20], tolerance relation [3, 4, 10, 18], and even arbitrary binary relation [5, 9, 24, 25, 26, 32] in some extensions of the classical rough sets. Another approach is the relaxation of the partition arising from equivalence relation to a cover. The cover of a universe is used to construct the lower and upper approximations of any subset of the universe [1, 2, 16, 27, 35].\nIn the literature, several different types of covering-based rough sets have been proposed and investigated; see, for example, [17, 23, 31, 34, 37] and the bibliographies therein. It is well-known that covers are a fundamental concept in topological spaces and play an important role in the study of topological properties. This motivates the research of covering rough sets from the point of topological view. Some initial attempts have already been made along the way. For example, Zhu and Wang examined the topological properties of the lower and upper approximation operations for covering generalized rough sets in [36, 38]. Wu et al. combined the notion of topological spaces into rough sets and then discussed the properties of topological rough spaces [22]. In [31], neighborhoods, another elementary concept in topology, have been used to define an upper approximation; some properties of approximation operations for this type of covering rough sets have been explored as well [8, 17, 31, 33].\nEmail address: pzhubupt@gmail.com (Ping Zhu)\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier November 11, 2016\nThe purpose of this paper is to investigate further the covering rough sets based on neighborhoods introduced first in [31]. With a little surprise, we find that the same upper approximation as in [31] can be achieved without using neighborhoods. (Certainly, it does not mean that the notion of neighborhoods is worthless, as we will see later.) To analyze the covers for covering rough sets, we introduce two operations that allow us to combine, or compose, two or more covers, as well as several operations on a single cover to modify appropriately the elements of the cover. In order to relate two covering approximation spaces, the notion of homomorphism used extensively in algebra and topology is introduced to covering rough sets. We also examine the properties of the lower and upper approximations preserved by the operations and homomorphisms, respectively.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we briefly review some basics of covering rough sets based on neighborhoods and provide a new equivalent characterization of the upper approximation without using neighborhoods. Based upon the equivalent characterization, the relationships between the lower and upper approximations are discussed in this section. Section 3 is devoted to the operations on covers and the preservation of approximations under these operators. We introduce the concept of homomorphism in Section 4 and conclude the paper in Section 5."}, {"heading": "2. Covering rough sets based on neighborhoods", "text": "This section consists of three subsections. In Section 2.1, we recall the definitions of Pawlak\u2019s rough sets and covering rough sets based on neighborhoods, and collect a few necessary facts to be used in later sections. Section 2.2 is devoted to providing an equivalent description of the upper approximation of covering rough sets without using neighborhoods. Applying the equivalent description, we briefly discuss the relationships between the lower and upper approximations in Section 2.3.\n2.1. Approximations by neighborhoods\nWe start by recalling some basic notions in Pawlak\u2019s rough set theory [11, 12]. Let U be a finite and nonempty universal set, and let R \u2286 U \u00d7 U be an equivalence relation on U. Denote by U/R the set of all equivalence classes induced by R. Such equivalence classes, also called elementary sets, give a partition of U; every union of elementary sets is called a definable set. For any X \u2286 U, one can characterize X by a pair of lower and upper approximations. The lower approximation X\u21d1 of X is defined as the greatest definable set contained in X, while the upper approximation X\u21d3 of X is defined as the least definable set containing X. Formally,\nX\u21d1 = \u222a{C \u2208 U/R |C \u2286 X} and X\u21d3 = \u222a{C \u2208 U/R |C \u2229 X , \u2205}.\nClearly, the notion of partitions plays an important role in the above approximations. As an extension of partitions, covers of the universe have been used to define the lower and upper approximations.\nDefinition 1. Let U be a finite and nonempty universal set, and C = {Ci | i \u2208 I} a family of nonempty subsets of U. If \u22c3\ni\u2208I Ci = U, then C is called a cover (or covering) of U. The ordered pair \u3008U,C \u3009 is said to be a covering approximation space.\nIt follows from the above definition that any partition of U is certainly a cover of U. For convenience, the members in a general cover (not necessarily a partition) are also called elementary sets, and any union of elementary sets is called a definable set. In the literature, there are several kinds of rough sets induced by a cover [1, 2, 16, 23, 27, 31, 34, 35, 37]. For our purpose, we only recall the covering rough sets based on the following concept of neighborhoods [31].\nDefinition 2. Let \u3008U,C \u3009 be a covering approximation space. For any x \u2208 U, the neighborhood of x is defined by N(x) = \u22c2 {C \u2208 C | x \u2208 C}.\nIn other words, the neighborhood of x is the intersection of elementary sets containing x. Based on this notion, Zhu proposed the following approximations in [31].\nDefinition 3. Let \u3008U,C \u3009 be a covering approximation space. For any X \u2286 U, the lower approximation of X is defined as\nX\u2191 C = \u222a{C \u2208 C |C \u2286 X}\nand the upper approximation of X is defined as\nX\u2193 C = \u222a{N(x) | x \u2208 X\\X\u2191 C } \u222a X\u2191 C ,\nin which we use \u201c\\\u201d as set difference.\nFor simplicity, we omit the subscript C in X\u2191 C and X\u2193 C whenever the context is clear. We will refer to \u201c\u2191\u201d and \u201c\u2193\u201d as the operations of obtaining the lower and upper approximations, respectively. Notice that in Definition 3 the lower approximation is the same as those in the other types of covering rough sets [16, 30, 35, 37], but the upper approximation is completely different. If the cover C is a partition of U, then it follows immediately from definition that X\u2191 = X\u21d1 and X\u2193 = X\u21d3.\nFor subsequent need, let us record an example.\nExample 1. Let U = {a, b, c, d}, C1 = {a, b}, C2 = {a, c}, and C3 = {b, d}. Then C = {C1,C2,C3} is a cover of U. We see that N(a) = {a}, N(b) = {b}, N(c) = {a, c}, and N(d) = {b, d}. For X = {a, d}, we have that X\u2191 = \u2205 and X\u2193 = {a, b, d} by Definition 3.\nThe following is a characterization of the upper approximation X\u2193 due to Zhu in [31].\nLemma 1 ([31], Theorem 1). Let \u3008U,C \u3009 be a covering approximation space. Then X\u2193 = \u22c3\nx\u2208X N(x) for any X \u2286 U.\n2.2. An equivalent characterization of the upper approximation\nThe purpose of this subsection is to provide an equivalent characterization of the upper approximation without using neighborhoods. To this end, we need a notion.\nDefinition 4. Let \u3008U,C \u3009 be a covering approximation space. Given X \u2286 U and C \u2032 \u2286 C , if \u22c3 C\u2208C \u2032 C \u2287 X, then C \u2032 is said to be a subcover of X.\nDenote by C (X) the set of all subcovers of X. By abusing notation we may view C as a mapping from P(U) to P(C ) that maps X to C (X), where we write P(S ) for the power set of a set S . Evidently, any cover C of the universal set U can be seen as a trivial subcover of X \u2286 U. For instance, in Example 1 both C \u2032 = {C1,C3} and C \u2032\u2032 = {C2,C3} are nontrivial subcovers of the set X = {a, d}. These, together with C , are all the subcovers of X, namely, C (X) = {C ,C \u2032,C \u2032\u2032}.\nObserve that in Definition 3 and Lemma 1, only the upper approximation is dependent on the notion of neighborhoods, which seems asymmetric. With a little surprise, the following result shows us that the same upper approximation can be defined without using neighborhoods. Of course, it does not mean that the notion of neighborhoods is useless; instead, neighborhood sometimes provides a very good characterization of the local properties of elements.\nTheorem 1. Suppose that \u3008U,C \u3009 is a covering approximation space. Then for any X \u2286 U,\nX\u2193 = \u22c2\nC \u2032\u2208C (X)\n\u22c3\nC\u2208C \u2032\nC.\nProof. To prove the equality, we only need to verify that \u22c3 x\u2208X N(x) = \u22c2 C \u2032\u2208C (X) \u22c3 C\u2208C \u2032 C by Lemma 1. Let us first show that \u22c3\nx\u2208X N(x) \u2286 \u22c2 C \u2032\u2208C (X) \u22c3 C\u2208C \u2032 C. Let y \u2208 \u22c3 x\u2208X N(x). Then there exists some xy \u2208 X such that y \u2208 N(xy), namely, y \u2208 \u2229{C \u2208 C | xy \u2208 C}. This means that for any elementary set C containing xy, we always have that y \u2208 C. On the other hand, for any subcover C \u2032 of X there is some C\u2032 \u2208 C \u2032 such that xy \u2208 C\u2032. By the previous argument, we see that y \u2208 C\u2032, and thus y \u2208 \u22c3\nC\u2208C \u2032 C. As the subcover C \u2032 \u2208 C (X) was arbitrary, we have that\ny \u2208 \u22c2 C \u2032\u2208C (X) \u22c3 C\u2208C \u2032 C. Hence, \u22c3 x\u2208X N(x) \u2286 \u22c2 C \u2032\u2208C (X) \u22c3 C\u2208C \u2032 C. Conversely, suppose that y \u2208 \u22c2\nC \u2032\u2208C (X) \u22c3 C\u2208C \u2032 C. Then we have that y \u2208 \u22c3 C\u2208C \u2032 C for any C \u2032 \u2208 C (X). It means\nthat for any C \u2032 \u2208 C (X), there exists C\u2032 \u2208 C \u2032 such that y \u2208 C\u2032. Seeking a contradiction, assume that y < \u22c3\nx\u2208X N(x). It\nimplies that y < N(x) for every x \u2208 X. Since N(x) = \u22c2\n{C \u2208 C | x \u2208 C} by definition, for each x \u2208 X there is Cx \u2208 C such that x \u2208 Cx, but y < Cx. Let C \u2032\u2032 be the collection of such Cx\u2019s, i.e.,\nC \u2032\u2032 = {Cx \u2208 C | \u2203x \u2208 X such that x \u2208 Cx, y < Cx}.\nAs a result, we find that C \u2032\u2032 is a cover of X. It follows from the previous argument that there exists C\u2032\u2032 \u2208 C \u2032\u2032 such that y \u2208 C\u2032\u2032, which contradicts the construction of C \u2032\u2032. Therefore, y \u2208 \u22c3\nx\u2208X N(x), and thus \u22c2 C \u2032\u2208C (X) \u22c3\nC\u2208C \u2032 C \u2286 \u22c3\nx\u2208X N(x), completing the proof of the theorem.\nNotice that for any X \u2286 U, the cover C of U is a trivial subcover of X, so we have the following corollary.\nCorollary 1. Suppose that \u3008U,C \u3009 is a covering approximation space. Then for any X \u2286 U,\nX\u2193 = \u22c2\nC \u2032\u2208C (X)\\{C }\n\u22c3\nC\u2208C \u2032\nC.\nProof. By Theorem 1, we have that\nX\u2193 = \u22c2\nC \u2032\u2208C (X)\n\u22c3\nC\u2208C \u2032\nC\n=\n(\n\u22c3\nC\u2208C\nC ) \u22c2 (\n\u22c2\nC \u2032\u2208C (X)\\{C }\n\u22c3\nC\u2208C \u2032\nC )\n= X \u22c2\n(\n\u22c2\nC \u2032\u2208C (X)\\{C }\n\u22c3\nC\u2208C \u2032\nC )\n= \u22c2\nC \u2032\u2208C (X)\\{C }\n\u22c3\nC\u2208C \u2032\nC,\nas desired.\nLet us calculate an upper approximation by using the above corollary.\nExample 2. We revisit Example 1, where U = {a, b, c, d}, C1 = {a, b}, C2 = {a, c}, C3 = {b, d}, and C = {C1,C2,C3} is a cover of U. For X = {a, d}, we have obtained that C (X) = {C ,C \u2032,C \u2032\u2032}, in which C \u2032 = {C1,C3} and C \u2032\u2032 = {C2,C3}. It follows from Corollary 1 that\nX\u2193 = \u22c2\nC \u2032\u2208C (X)\\{C }\n\u22c3\nC\u2208C \u2032\nC\n=\n(\n\u22c3\nC\u2208C \u2032\nC ) \u22c2 ( \u22c3\nC\u2208C \u2032\u2032\nC )\n= (C1 \u222a C3) \u2229 (C2 \u222a C3)\n= {a, b, d} \u2229 {a, b, c, d}\n= {a, b, d}.\nThis is consist with the result obtained by Definition 3 or Lemma 1.\n2.3. Relationships between the lower and upper approximations\nIn [31], Zhu pointed out that the lower and upper approximations in the covering rough sets based on neighborhoods are not independent. Roughly speaking, the lower approximation operation dominates the upper one, but the converse does not hold. The following proposition was given in [31]; the proof there is based upon a series of intermediate results, so we provide a direct proof by Theorem 1.\nProposition 1 ([31], Theorem 8). Suppose that U is a universal set and C and C \u2032 are two covers of U. If X\u2191 C = X\u2191 C \u2032 for all X \u2286 U, then X\u2193 C = X\u2193 C \u2032 for all X \u2286 U.\nProof. Suppose, by contradiction, that there exists X \u2286 U such that X\u2193 C , X\u2193 C \u2032 . Without loss of generality, we assume that there is a y \u2208 X\u2193 C , but y < X\u2193 C \u2032 . Clearly, y < X, since X \u2286 X\u2193 C and X \u2286 X\u2193 C \u2032 . Since y \u2208 X\u2193 C\n, we see by Theorem 1 that y \u2208 \u22c3\nC\u2208Ci C for any Ci \u2208 C (X). It forces that there is some xy \u2208 X such that for any C \u2208 C , xy \u2208 C implies y \u2208 C. Otherwise, we can obtain a subcover of X such that y does not belong to each member of the subcover, a contradiction. On the other hand, as y < X\u2193\nC \u2032 , by Theorem 1 there is C \u20320 \u2208 C \u2032(X) such that y < \u22c3 C\u2032\u2208C \u20320 C\u2032. Because\nxy \u2208 X \u2286 \u22c3 C\u2032\u2208C \u20320 C\u2032, there exists C\u20320 \u2208 C \u2032 0 \u2286 C \u2032 such that xy \u2208 C\u20320, but y < C \u2032 0. We thus have that C \u2032 0 \u2191 C = C\u20320 \u2191 C \u2032 = C\u20320 by the condition given in the proposition. Consequently, C\u20320 is the union of some sets in C , say, C \u2032 0 = \u22c3\ni\u2208I Ci. Then there exists j \u2208 I such that xy \u2208 C j \u2286 C\u20320. This yields that y \u2208 C j by the previous argument that xy \u2208 C implies y \u2208 C, for any C \u2208 C . It contradicts the fact that y < C\u20320. As a result, X \u2193 C = X\u2193 C \u2032 for all X \u2286 U, finishing the proof.\nAs mentioned above, the converse of Proposition 1 does not hold; the reader may refer to [31] for a counterexample. It should be stressed that if X\u2191\nC = X\u2191 C \u2032 for some (not all) X \u2286 U, then we cannot get X\u2193 C = X\u2193 C \u2032 in general.\nNevertheless, we have the following useful observation.\nCorollary 2. Let U be a universal set, and C and C \u2032 two covers of U. If C\u2191 C = C\u2191 C \u2032 for every C \u2208 C \u222a C \u2032, then for any X \u2286 U, X\u2191 C = X\u2191 C \u2032 and X\u2193 C = X\u2193 C \u2032 .\nProof. By Proposition 1, we only need to show that X\u2191 C = X\u2191 C \u2032 for any X \u2286 U. To this end, let X \u2286 U and assume that X\u2191 C = \u22c3 i\u2208I Ci for some Ci \u2208 C satisfying Ci \u2286 X. By condition, we have that Ci = Ci \u2191 C = Ci \u2191 C \u2032 = \u22c3 j\u2208Ji C \u2032 i j for some C\u2032i j \u2208 C \u2032 satisfying C\u2032i j \u2286 X. Therefore, X \u2191 C = \u22c3 i\u2208I Ci = \u22c3 i\u2208I \u22c3 j\u2208Ji C \u2032 i j \u2286 X \u2191 C \u2032 , namely, X\u2191 C \u2286 X\u2191 C \u2032 . The converse inclusion can be proven similarly. We thus obtain that X\u2191 C = X\u2191 C \u2032 , as desired.\nThe above corollary shows us that two covers of a universal set give the same lower (and also upper) approximations if and only if every elementary set in a cover is a definable set (i.e., the union of some elementary sets) in the other cover, and vice versa. This implies that two covers lead to the same approximations if and only if their elementary sets that are not a union of other elementary sets are the same. To formally state it, let us recall a concept introduced in [30, 35].\nDefinition 5. Let \u3008U,C \u3009 be a covering approximation space. If C \u2208 C cannot be written as a union of some sets in C \\{C}, then C is called irreducible in C , otherwise C is called reducible. Denote by irr(C ) the set of all irreducible elementary sets in C .\nIt follows from the definition above that any set in C is a definable set in irr(C ). Using Corollary 2, we present another proof of an important theorem appearing in [30, 31, 35].\nCorollary 3. Let U be a universal set, and C and C \u2032 two covers of U. Then, X\u2191 C = X\u2191 C \u2032 holds for all X \u2286 U if and only if irr(C ) = irr(C \u2032).\nProof. If irr(C ) = irr(C \u2032), then it is easy to check that C\u2191 C = C\u2191 C \u2032 for every C \u2208 C \u222a C \u2032. We thus get by Corollary 2 that X\u2191 C = X\u2191 C \u2032 for all X \u2286 U, and hence the sufficiency holds.\nNext, to see the necessity, suppose that X\u2191 C = X\u2191 C \u2032 holds for all X \u2286 U. In particular, we see that C\u2191 C = C\u2191 C \u2032 for any C \u2208 C \u222aC \u2032, which means that any set in C is a union of some sets in C \u2032 and also any set in C \u2032 is a union of some sets in C . Consequently, for any C \u2208 irr(C ), we have that C = \u22c3\ni\u2208I C \u2032 i for some C \u2032 i \u2208 irr(C \u2032). On the other hand, we also have that C\u2032i = \u22c3 j\u2208J Ci j for some Ci j \u2208 irr(C ), and thus, C = \u22c3 i\u2208I \u22c3\nj\u2208J Ci j. This forces that |I| = |J| = 1 (writing \u201c|S |\u201d for the cardinality of a set S ) since C \u2208 irr(C ). Therefore, C = C\u2032i \u2208 irr(C\n\u2032), namely, irr(C ) \u2286 irr(C \u2032). The converse inclusion may be proven in a similar way. This completes the proof.\nLet us illustrate the above corollary by a simple example.\nExample 3. Let U = {x1, x2, x3, x4}, Ci j = {xi, x j} with 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 4, and Ci jk = {xi, x j, xk} with 1 \u2264 i < j < k \u2264 4. Taking C = {Ci j | 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 4} \u222a {C123,C124} and C \u2032 = {Ci j | 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 4} \u222a {C123,C134,C234}, it is easy to see that irr(C ) = irr(C \u2032) = {Ci j | 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 4}, so the covers C and C \u2032 give the same lower (and also upper) approximations.\nEvidently, all definable sets of a cover constitute a new cover, but such a cover does not change the lower and upper approximations.\nCorollary 4. Suppose that \u3008U,C \u3009 is a covering approximation space. Let Cu = {\u22c3 C\u2208C \u2032 C | \u2205 , C \u2032 \u2286 C }\n. Then for all X \u2286 U, X\u2191\nC = X\u2191 Cu and X\u2193 C = X\u2193 Cu .\nProof. It is easy to see that irr(C ) = irr(Cu). Hence, the corollary holds by Corollary 3 and Proposition 1."}, {"heading": "3. Operations on covers", "text": "In this section, we are concerned with several operations on covers and the properties of the lower and upper approximations preserved by the operations.\nFor any universal set U, we write Cov(U) for the set of all covers of U. It is well-known that the number of possible covers for a set U of n elements is\n|Cov(U)| = 1 2\nn \u2211\nk=0\n(\u22121)k ( n k ) 22 n\u2212k .\nThe first few of which are 1, 5, 109, 32297, 2147321017, . . .. This quickly growing sequence is entry A003465 of Sloane [19]. Since Cov(U) contains a large number of covers in general, it may be of interest to investigate the operations on these covers.\n3.1. Unary operations\nLet U be a universal set. By Definition 5 we may view irr as a unary operation on Cov(U) that maps C to irr(C ). Moreover, it is clear by definition that the operator irr is idempotent in the sense that irr(irr(C )) = irr(C ) for any C \u2208 Cov(U). It turns out by Corollary 3 that both C and irr(C ) give rise to the same lower (and also upper) approximations for every subset of U; see also [30, 31, 35]. In other words, both the lower and upper approximations are preserved by the operator irr. In this subsection, we introduce two more unary operations on Cov(U) that preserve the upper (not necessarily the lower) approximations only.\nWe begin with the following notion.\nDefinition 6. Let \u3008U,C \u3009 be a covering approximation space. If C \u2208 C cannot be written as an intersection of some sets in C \\{C}, then C is called non-intersectional in C , otherwise C is called intersectional. Denote by int(C ) the set of all non-intersectional elementary sets in C .\nIt follows immediately from Definition 6 that int(C ) \u2208 Cov(U) for any C \u2208 Cov(U). Let us illustrate the definition by an example.\nExample 4. Let U = {x1, x2, x3, x4}, Ci = {xi} with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 4, Ci j = {xi, x j} with 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 4, and Ci jk = {xi, x j, xk} with 1 \u2264 i < j < k \u2264 4. Taking C = {C1,C2,C12,C13,C123,C124,C134,C234}, we see that C is a cover of U. Observe that C123, C124, C134, and C234 are non-intersectional, while C1, C2, C12, and C13 are intersectional in C . We thus have that int(C ) = {C123,C124,C134,C234}, which is still a cover of U.\nNotice that the function int: Cov(U) \u2212\u2192 Cov(U) that maps C to int(C ) is well-defined. Hence, we may view int as a unary operator on Cov(U). Clearly, by definition the operator int is idempotent in the sense that int(int(C )) = int(C ) for any C \u2208 Cov(U). Furthermore, we will show that the operator preserves the upper approximations. To this end, it is convenient to have the following lemma.\nLemma 2. Let \u3008U,C \u3009 be a covering approximation space. Then NC (x) = Nint(C )(x) for any x \u2208 U, where NC (x) and Nint(C )(x) are the neighborhoods of x with respect to C and int(C ), respectively.\nProof. It follows directly from Definitions 2 and 6.\nThe next theorem shows us that the operator int preserves the upper approximations.\nTheorem 2. Let \u3008U,C \u3009 be a covering approximation space. Then X\u2191int(C ) \u2286 X \u2191 C and X\u2193int(C ) = X \u2193 C for all X \u2286 U.\nProof. The first part follows directly from definition. For the second part, let X \u2286 U. Then we have by Lemma 1 that X\u2193int(C ) = \u22c3 x\u2208X Nint(C )(x) and X \u2193 C = \u22c3 x\u2208X NC (x). It follows from Lemma 2 that NC (x) = Nint(C )(x) for any x \u2208 U. Therefore, X\u2193int(C ) = X \u2193 C , as desired.\nRemark 1. It should be pointed out that the inclusion X\u2191int(C ) \u2286 X \u2191 C may be strict, which means that int cannot preserve the lower approximations in general. For instance, consider Example 4. It is easy to see that C1 \u2191\nC = C1 and\nC1 \u2191\nint(C ) = \u2205; the former has the latter as a proper subset.\nSimilar to Corollary 2, we also have the following theorem. It shows us that the upper approximation operation associated with a cover is determined by the upper approximations of elementary sets.\nTheorem 3. Let U be a universal set and C ,C \u2032 \u2208 Cov(U). If C\u2193 C = C\u2193 C \u2032 for every C \u2208 C \u222a C \u2032, then X\u2193 C = X\u2193 C \u2032 for all X \u2286 U.\nProof. By contradiction, assume that there exists X \u2286 U such that X\u2193 C , X\u2193 C \u2032 . Then we have by Lemma 1 that X\u2193 C = \u22c3 x\u2208X NC (x) and X \u2193 C \u2032 = \u22c3 x\u2208X NC \u2032 (x), where NC (x) = \u22c2 i\u2208I Ci and NC \u2032 (x) = \u22c2 j\u2208J C \u2032 j are the neighborhoods of x with respect to C and C \u2032, respectively. Thus, there exists x \u2208 X such that NC (x) , NC \u2032 (x); otherwise, X \u2193 C = X\u2193 C \u2032 . Without loss of generality, we assume that there is a y \u2208 NC (x) = \u22c2 i\u2208I Ci, but y < NC \u2032 (x) = \u22c2 j\u2208J C \u2032 j. Evidently, y , x and there is j\u2032 \u2208 J such that y < C\u2032j\u2032 . On the other hand, we find that y \u2208 C \u2032 j\u2032 because C \u2032 j\u2032 = C \u2032 j\u2032 \u2193 C \u2032 = C\u2032j\u2032 \u2193 C = \u22c3\nz\u2208C\u2032 j\u2032 NC (z) \u2287 NC (x) by condition and y \u2208 NC (x). It is a contradiction. Hence, X\n\u2193 C = X\u2193 C \u2032 for all X \u2286 U, as desired.\nNote that both irr and int are operators on Cov(U). It is interesting to consider their compositions. Let us write the composition of operators from right to left.\nRemark 2. We now check the compositions of irr and int. We find that irr \u25e6 int , int \u25e6 irr in general. For instance, consider the cover C = {C1,C2,C12,C13,C123,C124,C134,C234} in Example 4. There is no difficulty to get that irr \u25e6 int = {C123,C124,C134,C234} and int \u25e6 irr = {C2,C13,C124,C134, C234}; they are different. Nevertheless, we have by Corollary 2 and Theorem 3 that X\u2193\nC = X\u2193irr\u25e6int(C ) = X \u2193 int\u25e6irr(C ) for all X \u2286 U.\nLet us end this subsection with a brief discussion on the so-called neighborhood operator. We remark that a notion similar to neighborhood operator, called induced cover, was defined in [21] for another type of covering rough sets. Let U be a universal set. For any C \u2208 Cov(U), define nei(C ) = {N(x) | x \u2208 U}. Then it is easy to see that nei(C ) \u2208 Cov(U) and thus nei gives rise to a unary operator on Cov(U), called neighborhood operator.\nLike the operators irr and int, the neighborhood operator nei preserves the upper approximations as well.\nTheorem 4. Let \u3008U,C \u3009 be a covering approximation space. Then X\u2191 C \u2286 X\u2191nei(C ) and X \u2193 C = X\u2193nei(C ) for all X \u2286 U.\nProof. For the first part, note that \u22c3\nx\u2208X\u2191 C\nN(x) \u2287 X\u2191 C and X \u2287 N(x) for any x \u2208 X\u2191 C . We thus have that\nX\u2191nei(C ) = \u222a{N(x) | x \u2208 X such that N(x) \u2286 X}\n\u2287 \u222ax\u2208X\u2191 C\nN(x)\n\u2287 X\u2191 C ,\nnamely, X\u2191 C \u2286 X\u2191nei(C ).\nThe second part follows immediately from Lemma 2.\nRemark 3. We remark that the inclusion X\u2191 C \u2286 X\u2191nei(C ) may be strict. For example, setting U = {a, b, c} and C = {\n{a, b}, {b, c}, {a, c} } , we get that nei(C ) = { {a}, {b}, {c} }\n. Taking X = {a}, we see that X\u2191 C = \u2205 and X\u2191nei(C ) = X; the former is properly included in the latter.\n3.2. Composition operations\nWe define two operations on covers: the union, denoted by \u2228, and the intersection, denoted by \u2227. For simplicity, we present these operations for two covers.\nLet us begin with the union operation.\nDefinition 7. Let U be a universal set and C1,C2 \u2208 Cov(U). The union of C1 and C2, denoted by C1 \u2228 C2, is defined as C1 \u222a C2, the usual union of sets C1 and C2.\nClearly, C1 \u2228 C2 \u2208 Cov(U) whenever C1,C2 \u2208 Cov(U). Further, we have the following property.\nTheorem 5. Let U be a universal set and C1,C2 \u2208 Cov(U). Then for all X \u2286 U, X \u2191 Ci \u2286 X\u2191 C1\u2228C2 and X\u2193 C1\u2228C2 \u2286 X\u2193 Ci , where i = 1, 2.\nProof. Let X \u2286 U. Then by definition we see that\nX\u2191 C1\u2228C2 = \u222a{C \u2208 C1 \u222a C2 |C \u2286 X}\n= ( \u222a{C \u2208 C1 |C \u2286 X} ) \u222a ( \u222a{C \u2208 C2 |C \u2286 X} )\n\u2287 \u222a{C \u2208 Ci |C \u2286 X} = X\u2191 Ci ,\nnamely, X\u2191 Ci \u2286 X\u2191 C1\u2228C2 . For the second part, it follows from the fact Ci \u2286 C1 \u2228 C2 and Theorem 1 that\nX\u2193 C1\u2228C2\n= \u22c2\nC\u2208C1\u2228C2(X)\n\u22c3\nC\u2208C\nC\n\u2286 \u22c2\nC\u2208Ci(X)\n\u22c3\nC\u2208C\nC\n= X\u2193 Ci ,\nthat is, X\u2193 C1\u2228C2 \u2286 X\u2193 Ci , as desired. This completes the proof of the theorem.\nWe now turn our attention to the intersection operation.\nDefinition 8. Let U be a universal set and C1,C2 \u2208 Cov(U). The intersection of C1 and C2, denoted by C1 \u2227 C2, is defined as {NC1\u222aC2 (x) | x \u2208 U}, where NC1\u222aC2 (x) = \u2229{C \u2208 C1 \u222a C2 | x \u2208 C}.\nAgain, C1 \u2227 C2 \u2208 Cov(U) whenever C1,C2 \u2208 Cov(U). Like Theorem 5, we have the following property.\nTheorem 6. Let U be a universal set and C1,C2 \u2208 Cov(U). Then for all X \u2286 U, X \u2191 Ci \u2286 X\u2191 C1\u2227C2 and X\u2193 C1\u2227C2 \u2286 X\u2193 Ci , where i = 1, 2.\nProof. For any x \u2208 U, let N(x) denote the neighborhood of x with respect to the cover C1 \u2227 C2. Then by the construction of C1 \u2227 C2 we always have that N(x) = NC1\u222aC2 (x). In addition, for any C \u2208 C1 \u222a C2 and x \u2208 C, we see that N(x) \u2286 C. Therefore, \u22c3\nx\u2208C N(x) \u2286 C. Clearly, C \u2286 \u22c3 x\u2208C N(x), and we thus obtain that C = \u22c3 x\u2208C N(x), i.e., C = \u22c3\nx\u2208C NC1\u222aC2 (x). It means that every elementary set in Ci (i = 1, 2) is a union of some elementary sets in C1 \u2227C2. This forces that X\u2191\nCi \u2286 X\u2191 C1\u2227C2 for all X \u2286 U.\nFor the second part, note that we always have that NC1\u222aC2 (x) \u2286 NCi (x), i = 1, 2, for any x \u2208 U, that is, N(x) \u2286 NCi (x). It follows immediately from Lemma 1 that X \u2193 C1\u2227C2 \u2286 X\u2193 Ci , finishing the proof.\nIn fact, the union and intersection operations of covers are related, as shown below.\nProposition 2. Let U be a universal set and C1,C2 \u2208 Cov(U). Then C1 \u2227 C2 = nei(C1 \u2228 C2).\nProof. It follows directly from Definitions 7 and 8 and the definition of neighborhood operator.\nThe next example illustrates the composition operations defined above.\nExample 5. As in Example 4, let U = {x1, x2, x3, x4}, Ci = {xi} with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 4, Ci j = {xi, x j} with 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 4, and Ci jk = {xi, x j, xk} with 1 \u2264 i < j < k \u2264 4. Take C1 = {C12,C24,C234} and C2 = {C123,C234}. Then by definition we get that C1 \u2228 C2 = {C12,C24,C123,C234} and C1 \u2227 C2 = {C12,C2,C23,C24}. For X = C23, we can readily obtain by a routine computation that X\u2191\nC1 = X\u2191 C2 = X\u2191 C1\u2228C2 = \u2205, X\u2191 C1\u2227C2 = X\u2193 C2 = X\u2193 C1\u2228C2 = X\u2193 C1\u2227C2 = C23, and X \u2193 C1 = C234."}, {"heading": "4. Homomorphisms between covering approximation spaces", "text": "In this section, we look at the preservation properties of the lower and upper approximations under homomorphism, a mapping between covering approximation spaces.\nRecall that by elementary sets we mean the sets in a cover. The unions of elementary sets are referred to as definable sets. With the concept of definable sets, we may conveniently give the definition of homomorphism.\nDefinition 9. Let \u3008U,C \u3009 and \u3008V,D\u3009 be two covering approximation spaces. A mapping f : U \u2212\u2192 V is called a homomorphism from \u3008U,C \u3009 to \u3008V,D\u3009 if it maps each definable set of \u3008U,C \u3009 to a definable set of \u3008V,D\u3009.\nIn other words, a homomorphism is a mapping that sends definable sets to definable sets. Let us see several examples.\nExample 6. Let \u3008U,C \u3009 be a covering approximation space. Denote by idU the identity mapping on U that maps every element to itself. Then the following facts hold:\n(1) idU is both a homomorphism from \u3008U,C \u3009 to \u3008U, irr(C )\u3009 and a homomorphism from \u3008U, irr(C )\u3009 to \u3008U,C \u3009. (2) idU is a homomorphism from \u3008U,C \u3009 to \u3008U, nei(C )\u3009, but not a homomorphism from \u3008U, nei(C )\u3009 to \u3008U,C \u3009 in\ngeneral. (3) idU is a homomorphism from \u3008U, int(C )\u3009 to \u3008U,C \u3009, but not a homomorphism from \u3008U,C \u3009 to \u3008U, int(C )\u3009 in\ngeneral.\nHomomorphisms have the following property.\nLemma 3. If f : \u3008U,C \u3009 \u2212\u2192 \u3008V,D\u3009 is a homomorphism between covering approximation spaces, then f (X\u2191) \u2286 f (X)\u2191 for any X \u2286 U.\nProof. Given X \u2286 U, assume that X\u2191 = \u22c3\ni\u2208I Ci for some Ci \u2208 C satisfying Ci \u2286 X, and also assume that f (Ci) = \u22c3\nji\u2208Ji D ji for some D ji \u2208 D . Evidently, D ji \u2286 f (X) for all i \u2208 I and ji \u2208 Ji. We thus have that\nf (X\u2191) = f (\u222ai\u2208ICi)\n= \u222ai\u2208I f (Ci)\n= \u222ai\u2208I \u222a ji\u2208Ji D ji \u2286 f (X),\ni.e., f (X\u2191) \u2286 f (X). It means that f (X\u2191) \u2286 f (X)\u2191 since every D ji \u2208 D . This completes the proof.\nOne may wonder whether or not there is a corresponding inclusion relation between f (X\u2193) and f (X)\u2193. As shown in the next remark, the answer is \u201cno\u201d, in general.\nRemark 4. Let U = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5}, V = {y1, y2, y3, y4}, C = { {x1, x2}, {x2, x3}, {x4, x5} } , and D = { {y1, y2}, {y3}, {y4} }\n. Then we get two covering approximation spaces \u3008U,C \u3009 and \u3008V,D\u3009. Setting f (x1) = f (x3) = y1, f (x2) = y2, f (x4) = y3, and f (x5) = y4 and taking X = {x2, x4}, we obtain that X\u2193 = {x2, x4, x5} and f (X) = {y2, y3}. Further, we have that f (X\u2193) = {y2, y3, y4} and f (X)\u2193 = {y1, y2, y3}. As we see, there is no inclusion relation between f (X\u2193) and f (X)\u2193.\nRecall that a mapping is said to be bijective if it is both injective and surjective. If a homomorphism f between two covering approximation spaces is bijective, and moreover, the inverse mapping f \u22121 of f is also a homomorphism, then f is called an isomorphism. For instance, the homomorphism idU from \u3008U,C \u3009 to \u3008U, irr(C )\u3009 is isomorphic.\nThe following theorem shows us that isomorphisms preserve the lower and upper approximations.\nTheorem 7. If f : \u3008U,C \u3009 \u2212\u2192 \u3008V,D\u3009 is an isomorphism between covering approximation spaces, then for any X \u2286 U, f (X\u2191) = f (X)\u2191 and f (X\u2193) = f (X)\u2193.\nTo prove the theorem, it is convenient to have the following lemma, which says that the image of the neighborhood of x under an isomorphism f is exactly the neighborhood of f (x).\nLemma 4. If f : \u3008U,C \u3009 \u2212\u2192 \u3008V,D\u3009 is an isomorphism between covering approximation spaces, then for any x \u2208 U, f (NC (x)) = ND ( f (x)).\nProof. For any x \u2208 U, suppose that NC (x) = \u22c2 i\u2208I Ci for some Ci \u2208 C with x \u2208 Ci, and suppose that f (Ci) = \u22c3\nji\u2208Ji D ji for some D ji \u2208 D . Note that x \u2208 Ci, hence f (x) \u2208 f (Ci), and thus, there exists 0i \u2208 Ji such that f (x) \u2208 D0i . Because f is isomorphic, we get that\nf (NC (x)) = f (\u2229i\u2208ICi)\n= \u2229i\u2208I f (Ci)\n= \u2229i\u2208I \u222a ji\u2208Ji D ji \u2287 \u2229i\u2208I D0i \u2287 ND ( f (x)),\nnamely, f (NC (x)) \u2287 ND ( f (x)). Since f \u22121 is a homomorphism, we have that f \u22121[ND ( f (x))] \u2287 NC ( f \u22121( f (x))) = NC (x), i.e., f \u22121[ND ( f (x))] \u2287 NC (x). Applying f to the inclusion, we see that ND ( f (x)) \u2287 f (NC (x)). This, together with the previous argument, forces that f (NC (x)) = ND ( f (x)), thus proving the lemma.\nWe can now present a proof of Theorem 7.\nProof of Theorem 7. Let X \u2286 U. We first verify that f (X\u2191) = f (X)\u2191. In fact, it follows at once from Lemma 3 that f (X\u2191) \u2286 f (X)\u2191. Applying f \u22121 to the inclusion, we see that f \u22121[ f (X\u2191)] \u2286 f \u22121[ f (X)\u2191], namely, X\u2191 \u2286 f \u22121[ f (X)\u2191]. On the other hand, we have by Lemma 3 that f \u22121[ f (X)\u2191] \u2286 f \u22121[ f (X)]\u2191 = X\u2191 since f \u22121 is a homomorphism and f (X) \u2286 V . Consequently, X\u2191 \u2286 f \u22121[ f (X)\u2191] \u2286 X\u2191, which forces that X\u2191 = f \u22121[ f (X)\u2191]. Applying f to the equality gives rise to f (X\u2191) = f (X)\u2191, as desired.\nLet us turn now to the proof of f (X\u2193) = f (X)\u2193. Using Lemma 4 and the condition that f is bijective, we obtain by Lemma 1 that\nf (X\u2193) = f (\u222ax\u2208XNC (x))\n= \u222ax\u2208X f (NC (x))\n= \u222ax\u2208XND ( f (x))\n= \u222a f (x)\u2208 f (X)ND ( f (x))\n= \u222ay\u2208 f (X)ND (y) = f (X)\u2193,\nthat is, f (X\u2193) = f (X)\u2193. This completes the proof of the theorem.\nAs mentioned above, the homomorphism idU : \u3008U,C \u3009 \u2212\u2192 \u3008U, irr(C )\u3009 is an isomorphism. Therefore, the following result given in [30, 31, 35] is a direct corollary of Theorem 7.\nCorollary 5. Let \u3008U,C \u3009 be a covering approximation space. Then for any X \u2286 U, X\u2191 C = X\u2191irr(C ) and X \u2193 C = X\u2193irr(C )."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have explored more properties of the covering rough sets based on neighborhoods. It has been shown that the upper approximation based on neighborhoods can be defined equivalently without using the notion of neighborhoods. Several operations on covers and homomorphisms between covering approximation spaces have\nbeen introduced to covering rough sets. We have also verified the properties of the lower and upper approximations preserved by the operations and homomorphisms, respectively.\nThe present work focuses on the covering rough sets based on neighborhoods. It would be interesting to examine the operations on covers and homomorphisms between covering approximation spaces for other types of covering rough sets. In addition, some other issues in topology such as continuous maps and homeomorphisms remain yet to be addressed in the covering rough sets based on neighborhoods."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China."}], "references": [{"title": "Extensions and intentions in the rough set theory", "author": ["Z.

by equivalence relations. Covering rough sets are a natural extension of classical rough sets by relaxing the partitions arising from equivalence relations to covers. Recently, some topological concepts such as neighborhood have been applied to covering rough sets. In this paper, we further investigate the covering rough sets based on neighborhoods by approximation operations. We show that the upper approximation based on neighborhoods can be defined equivalently without using neighborhoods. To analyze the covers themselves, we introduce unary and composition operations on covers. A notion of homomorphism is provided to relate two covering approximation spaces. We also examine the properties of approximations preserved by the operations and homomorphisms, respectively.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
