Introduction", "text": "The goal of a well-designed statistical database is to provide aggregate information about a database's entries while maintaining individual entries' privacy. These two goals of utility and privacy are inherently discordant. For a mechanism to be useful, its responses must closely resemble some target statistic of the database's entries. However to protect privacy, it is often necessary for the mechanism's response distribution to be `smoothed out', i.e., the mechanism must be randomized to reduce the individual entries' in uence on this distribution. It has been of key interest to the statistical database community to understand when the goals of utility and privacy can be e ciently achieved simultaneously (Dinur and Nissim, 2003; Barak et al., 2007; Dwork et al., 2007; Blum et al., 2008; Chaudhuri and Monteleoni, 2009; Kasiviswanathan et al., 2008). In this paper we consider the practical goal of private regularized empirical risk minimization (ERM) in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces for the special case of the Support Vector Machine (SVM). We adopt the strong notion of di erential privacy as formalized by Dwork (2006). Our e cient new mechanisms are shown to parametrize functions that are close to non-private SVM under the L\u221e-norm, with high probability. In our setting this notion of utility is stronger than closeness of risk (cf. Remark 3).\nWe employ a number of algorithmic and proof techniques new to di erential privacy. One of our new mechanisms borrows a technique from large-scale learning, in which regularized ERM is performed in a random feature space whose inner-product uniformly approximates the target feature space inner-product. This random feature space is constructed by viewing the target kernel as a probability measure in the Fourier domain. This technique enables the nite parametrization of responses from function classes with in nite VC dimension. To establish utility, we show that regularized ERM is relatively insensitive to perturbations of the kernel: not only does the technique of learning in a random RKHS enable nitely-encoded privacypreserving responses, but these responses well-approximate the responses of non-private SVM. Together these two techniques may prove useful in extending privacy-preserving mechanisms to learn in large function spaces. To prove di erential privacy, we borrow a proof technique from the area of algorithmic stability. We believe that stability may become a fruitful avenue for constructing new private mechanisms in the future, based on learning maps presently known to be stable.\nDate: December 1, 2009.\n1\nar X\niv :0\n91 1.\n57 08\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n3 0\nN ov\n2 00\n9\nOf particular interest, is the optimal di erential privacy of the SVM, which loosely speaking is the best level of privacy achievable by any accurate mechanism for SVM learning. Through our privacy-preserving mechanisms for the SVM, endowed with guarantees of utility, we upper bound optimal di erential privacy. We also provide lower bounds on the SVM's optimal di erential privacy, which are impossibility results for simultaneously achieving high levels of utility and privacy.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. After concluding this section with a summary of related work, we recall basic concepts of di erential privacy and SVM learning in Section 2. Sections 3 and 4 describe the new mechanisms for private SVM learning for nite-dimensional feature maps and (potentially in nite-dimensional) feature maps with translation-invariant kernels. Each mechanism is accompanied with proofs of privacy and utility bounds. Section 5 considers the special case of hinge loss and presents an upper bound on the SVM's optimal di erential privacy. A corresponding lower bound is then given in Section 6. We conclude the paper with several open problems.\n1.1. Related Work. There is a rich literature of prior work on di erential privacy in the theory community. The following sections summarize work related to our own, organized to contrast this work with our main contributions.\n1.1.1. Range Spaces Parametrizing Vector-Valued Statistics or Functions with Finite VC-dimension. Early work on private interactive mechanisms focused on approximating real- and vector-valued statistics (e.g., Dinur and Nissim, 2003; Blum et al., 2005; Dwork et al., 2006; Dwork, 2006; Barak et al., 2007). McSherry and Talwar (2007) rst considered private mechanisms with range spaces parametrizing sets more general than real-valued vectors, and used such di erentially private mappings for mechanism design. More related to our work are the private mechanisms for regularized logistic regression proposed and analyzed by Chaudhuri and Monteleoni (2009). There the mechanism's range space parametrizes the VC-dimension d + 1 class of linear hyperplanes in Rd. Kasiviswanathan et al. (2008) showed that discretized concept classes can be PAC learned or agnostically learned privately, albeit via an ine cient mechanism. Blum et al. (2008) showed that non-interactive mechanisms can privately release anonymized data such that utility is guaranteed over classes of predicate queries with polynomial VC dimension, when the domain is discretized. Dwork et al. (2009) more recently characterized when utility and privacy can be achieved by e cient non-interactive mechanisms. In this paper we consider e cient mechanisms for private SVM learning, whose range spaces parametrize real-valued functions (whose sign form trained classi ers). One case covered by our analysis is learning with a Gaussian kernel, which corresponds to learning over a class of in nite VC dimension.\n1.1.2. Practical Privacy-Preserving Learning (Mostly) via Subset-Sums. Most prior work in di erential privacy has focused on the deep analysis of mechanisms for relatively simple statistics (with histograms and contingency tables as explored by Blum et al. 2005 and Barak et al. 2007 respectively, as examples) and learning algorithms (e.g., interval queries and half-spaces as explored by Blum et al. 2008), or on constructing learning algorithms that can be decomposed into subset-sum operations (e.g., perceptron, k-NN, ID3 as described by Blum et al. 2005, and various recommender systems due to the work of McSherry and Mironov 2009). By contrast, we consider the practical goal of SVM learning, which does not decompose into subsetsums. It is also notable that our mechanisms run in polynomial time. The most related work to our own in this regard is due to Chaudhuri and Monteleoni (2009), although their results hold only for di erentiable loss, and nite feature mappings.\n1.1.3. The Privacy-Utility Trade-O . Like several prior studies, we consider the trade-o between privacy and utility. Barak et al. (2007) presented a mechanism for releasing contingency tables that guarantees di erential privacy and also guarantees a notion of accuracy: with high probability all marginals from the released table are close in L1-norm to the true table's marginals. As mentioned above, Blum et al. (2008) developed a private non-interactive mechanism that releases anonymized data such that all predicate queries in a VC-class take on similar values on the anonymized data and original data. In the work of Kasiviswanathan et al. (2008), utility corresponds to PAC learning: with high probability the response and target concepts are close, averaged over the underlying measure.\nA sequence of prior negative results have shown that any mechanism providing overly accurate responses cannot be private (Dinur and Nissim, 2003; Dwork et al., 2007; Dwork and Yekhanin, 2008). Dinur and Nissim (2003) showed that if noise of rate only o( \u221a n) is added to subset sum queries on a database of bits then an adversary can reconstruct a 1\u2212 o(1) fraction of the database. This is a threshold phenomenon that\nsays if accuracy is too small, privacy cannot be guaranteed at all. This result was more recently extended to allow for mechanisms that answer a small fraction of queries arbitrarily (Dwork et al., 2007). We show a similar negative result for the private SVM setting: any mechanism that is too accurate with respect to the SVM cannot guarantee strong levels of privacy.\n1.1.4. Connections between Stability, Robust Statistics, and Global Sensitivity. To prove di erential privacy, we borrow a proof technique from the area of algorithmic stability. In passing Kasiviswanathan et al. (2008) note the similarity between notions of algorithmic stability and di erential privacy, however do not exploit this. The connection between algorithmic stability and di erential privacy is qualitatively similar to the recent work of Dwork and Lei (2009) who demonstrated that robust estimators can serve as the basis for private mechanisms, by exploiting the limited in uence of outliers on such estimators."}, {"heading": "2. Background & Definitions", "text": "A database D is a sequence of n > 1 entries or rows (xi, yi) \u2208 Rd \u00d7 {\u22121, 1}, which are input point-label pairs or examples. We say that a pair of databases D1, D2 are neighbors if they di er on one entry. A mechanism M is a service trusted with access to a database D, that releases aggregate information about D while maintaining privacy of individual entries. By M(D) we mean the response of M on D. We assume that this is the only information released by the mechanism. Denote the range space ofM by TM . We adopt the following strong notion of di erential privacy due to Dwork (2006).\nDe nition 1. For any \u03b2 > 0, a randomized mechanism M provides \u03b2-di erential privacy, if, for all neighboring databases D1, D2 and all responses t \u2208 TM ,\nlog (\nPr (M(D1) = t) Pr (M(D2) = t)\n) \u2264 \u03b2 .\nThe probability in the de nition is over the randomization in M . For continuous TM we mean by this ratio a Radon-Nikodym derivative of the distribution of M(D1) with respect to the distribution of M(D2). If an adversary knows M and the rst n \u2212 1 entries of D, she may simulate the mechanism with di erent choices for the missing example. If the mechanism's response distribution varies smoothly with her choice, the adversary will not be able to infer the true value of entry n by querying M . In the sequel we assume WLOG that each pair of neighboring databases di er on their last entry.\nIntuitively the more an `interesting'1 mechanism M is perturbed to guarantee di erential privacy, the less like M the resulting mechanism M\u0302 will become. The next de nition formalizes the notion of `likeness'.\nDe nition 2. Consider two mechanisms M\u0302 and M with the same domain and response spaces TM\u0302 , TM respectively. Let X be some set and let F be a space of real-valued functions on X that is parametrized by the response spaces: for every t \u2208 TM\u0302 \u222a TM let ft \u2208 F be some function. Finally assume F is endowed with norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016F . Then for > 0 and 0 < \u03b4 < 1 we say that2 M\u0302 is ( , \u03b4)-useful with respect to M if, for all databases D, Pr\n(\u2225\u2225\u2225fM\u0302(D) \u2212 fM(D)\u2225\u2225\u2225F \u2264 ) \u2265 \u03b4. Typically M\u0302 will be a privacy-preserving version of M , that has been perturbed somehow. Usefulness means that not only does M\u0302 guarantee privacy of the training database, but that the aggregate information revealed about the database by M\u0302 is `close' to what would be revealed by the desired (but non-private) mechanism M . In the sequel we will take \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016F to be the sup-norm over a subset M \u2286 Rd containing the data, which we denote by \u2016f\u2016\u221e;M = supx\u2208M |f(x)|. It will also be convenient to use the notation \u2016k\u2016\u221e;M = supx,y\u2208M |k(x,y)| for bivariate functions k(\u00b7, \u00b7). Remark 3. In the sequel we develop privacy-preserving mechanisms that are useful with respect to the Support Vector Machine (see the next section for a brief introduction to the SVM). The SVM works to minimize the expected hinge-loss (i.e., risk in terms of the hinge-loss), which is a convex surrogate for the expected 0-1 loss. Since the hinge-loss is Lipschitz in the real-valued function output by the SVM, it follows that a mechanism M\u0302 having utility with respect to the SVM also has expected hinge-loss that is within\n1Examples of interesting properties include low risk, robustness to a small amount of malicious noise, etc. 2Note that we have chosen to overload the term ( , \u03b4)-usefulness introduced by Blum et al. (2008) for non-interactive mechanisms that release anonymized data. Our de nition of usefulness is analogous for the present setting of privacy-preserving learning, where a single function is released.\nAlgorithm 1 SVM Inputs: database D = {(xi, yi)}ni=1 with xi \u2208 Rd, yi \u2208 {\u22121, 1}; kernel k : Rd \u00d7 Rd \u2192 R; convex loss function `; parameter C > 0.\n(1) \u03b1? \u2190 Solve the QP dual of Primal (2.1) (see e.g., the derivations by Bishop 2006); and (2) Return vector \u03b1?.\nof the SVM's hinge-loss with high probability. That is, ( , \u03b4)-usefulness with respect to the sup-norm is stronger than guaranteed closeness of risk (absolute bounds on risk for regularized logistic regression are explored by Chaudhuri and Monteleoni 2009; Kasiviswanathan et al. 2008 consider the task of private PAC learning, which demands closeness of risk). We consider the hinge-loss further in Sections 5 and 6. Until then we work with arbitrary convex, Lipschitz losses.\nWe will see that the presented analysis does not simultaneously guarantee privacy at arbitrary levels and utility at arbitrary accuracy. The highest level of privacy guaranteed over all ( , \u03b4)-useful mechanisms with respect to a target mechanism M , is quanti ed by the optimal di erential privacy for M . We de ne this notion for the SVM here, but the concept extends to any target mechanism of interest. We present upper and lower bounds on \u03b2( , \u03b4, C, n, `, k) for the SVM in Sections 5 and 6 respectively.\nDe nition 4. For , C > 0, \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1), n > 1, loss function `(y, y\u0302) convex in y\u0302, and kernel k, the optimal di erential privacy for the SVM is the function\n\u03b2( , \u03b4, C, n, `, k) = inf M\u0302\u2208I sup (D1,D2)\u2208D sup t\u2208TM\u0302 log\nPr ( M\u0302(D1) = t ) Pr ( M\u0302(D2) = t )  ,\nwhere I is the set of all ( , \u03b4)-useful mechanisms with respect to the SVM with parameter C, loss `, and kernel k; and D is the set of all pairs of neighboring databases with n entries.\n2.1. Background on Support Vector Machines. Soft-margin SVM learning corresponds to the convex Primal program\nmin w\u2208RF\n1 2 \u2016w\u201622 + C n n\u2211 i=1 ` (yi, fw(xi)) ,(2.1) where the xi \u2208 Rd are training input points and the yi \u2208 {\u22121, 1} are their training labels, n is the size of the training set, \u03c6 : Rd \u2192 RF is a feature mapping taking points in input space Rd to some (possibly in nite) F -dimensional feature space, `(y, y\u0302) is a loss function convex in y\u0302, and w is a hyperplane normal vector in feature space.\nWhen F is nite, predictions are made by taking the sign of f?(x) = fw?(x) = \u3008\u03c6(x),w?\u3009. We will refer to both fw(\u00b7) and sgn (fw(\u00b7)) as classi ers, with the exact meaning apparent from the context. When F is large and when inner-products in feature space may be computed quickly via an explicit representation of the kernel function k(x,y) = \u3008\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y)\u3009, the solution may be more easily obtained via the dual. For example, see Program (5.1) in Section 5 for the dual formulation of the hinge-loss `(y, y\u0302) = (1 \u2212 yy\u0302)+, which is the loss most commonly associated with soft-margin SVM. Other examples include the square loss (1 \u2212 yy\u0302)2 and logistic loss log (1 + exp (\u2212yy\u0302)). The vector of maximizing dual variables \u03b1? returned by dualized SVM parametrizes the function f? = f\u03b1? as f\u03b1(\u00b7) = \u2211m i=1 \u03b1iyik(\u00b7,xi).\nMore generally, the Support Vector Machine can be seen as performing regularized ERM in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) H. The Representer Theorem (Kimeldorf and Wahba, 1971) states that the minimizing f? = arg minf\u2208H 12\u2016f\u2016 2 H + C n \u2211n i=1 `(yi, f(xi)) lies in the span of the functions k(\u00b7,xi) \u2208 H. Indeed the above dual expansion shows that the coordinates in this subspace are given by the \u03b1?i yi. We de ne the mechanism SVM to be the dual optimization that responds with the vector \u03b1?, as described by Algorithm 1. For general information about SVMs see e.g., (Burges, 1998; Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000; Sch\u00f6lkopf and Smola, 2001; Bishop, 2006). We end this section with the de nition of an important class of kernels (see Table 1 for examples).\nDe nition 5. A kernel function of the form k(x,y) = g(x \u2212 y), for some function g, is called translationinvariant."}, {"heading": "3. Mechanism for Finite Feature Maps", "text": "As a rst step towards private SVM learning we begin by considering the simple case of nite F - dimensional feature maps. Algorithm 2 describes the PrivateSVM-Finite mechanism, which follows the usual pattern of preserving di erential privacy: after forming the primal solution to the SVM an F -dimensional vector the mechanism adds Laplace-distributed noise to the weight vector. Guaranteeing di erential privacy proceeds via the usual two-step process of calculating the L1-sensitivity of the SVM's weight vector, then showing that \u03b2-di erential privacy follows from sensitivity together with the choice of Laplace noise with scale equal to sensitivity divided by \u03b2.\nTo calculate sensitivity, we exploit the algorithmic stability of regularized ERM. Intuitively, stability corresponds to continuity of a learning map. Several notions of stability are known to lead to good generalization error bounds (Devroye and Wagner, 1979; Kearns and Ron, 1999; Bousquet and Elissee , 2002; Kutin and Niyogi, 2002), sometimes in cases where class capacity-based approaches such as VC theory do not apply. A learning map A is a function that maps a database D to a classi er fD; it is precisely the composition of a mechanism followed by the classi er parametrization mapping.3 A learning map A is said to have \u03b3-uniform stability with respect to loss `(\u00b7, \u00b7) if for all neighboring databases D,D\u2032, the losses of the classi ers trained on D and D\u2032 are close on all test examples \u2016`(\u00b7,A(D))\u2212 `(\u00b7,A(D\u2032))\u2016\u221e \u2264 \u03b3 (Bousquet and Elissee , 2002). Our rst lemma computes sensitivity by following the proof of (Sch\u00f6lkopf and Smola, 2001, Theorem 12.4) which establishes that SVM learning has uniform stability (a result due to Bousquet and Elissee 2002). For simplicity we restrict the proof of sensitivity to di erentiable loss functions in Lemma 6; the result remains the same for general convex loss functions. See Lemma 21 for an almost identical proof for subdi erentiable losses.\nLemma 6. Consider loss function `(y, y\u0302) that is di erentiable, convex and L-Lipschitz in y\u0302, and an RKHS H induced by nite F -dimensional feature mapping \u03c6 with bounded norm k(x,x) \u2264 \u03ba2 for all x \u2208 Rd.

Now by the reproducing property and Cauchy-Schwartz inequality we can upper bound the classi er di erence's in nity norm by the Euclidean norm on the weight vectors: for each x \u2223\u2223fwD (x)\u2212 fwD\u2032 (x)\u2223\u2223 = |\u3008\u03c6(x),wD \u2212wD\u2032\u3009|\n\u2264 \u2016\u03c6(x)\u20162 \u2016wD \u2212wD\u2032\u20162 = \u221a k(x,x) \u2016wD \u2212wD\u2032\u20162 \u2264 \u03ba \u2016wD \u2212wD\u2032\u20162 .\nCombining this with Inequality (3.3) yields \u2016wD\u2212wD\u2032\u20162 \u2264 4LC\u03ba/n. L1-based sensitivity then follows from the inequality \u2016w\u20161 \u2264 \u221a F\u2016w\u20162 for all w \u2208 RF .\nWith the weight vector's sensitivity in hand, di erential privacy follows immediately from the proof technique established by Dwork et al. (2006).\nTheorem 7 (Privacy of PrivateSVM-Finite). For any \u03b2 > 0, database D of size n, C > 0, loss function `(y, y\u0302) that is convex and L-Lipschitz in y\u0302, and nite F -dimensional feature map with kernel k(x,x) \u2264 \u03ba2 for all x \u2208 Rd, PrivateSVM-Finite run on D with loss `, kernel k, noise parameter \u03bb \u2265 4LC\u03ba \u221a F/(\u03b2n) and regularization parameter C guarantees \u03b2-di erential privacy.\nThis rst main result establishes the usual kind of di erential privacy guarantee for the new PrivateSVMFinite algorithm. The more private the data, the more noise must be added. The more entries in the database, the less noise is needed to achieve the same level of privacy. Since the noise vector \u00b5 has exponential tails, standard tail bound inequalities quickly lead to ( , \u03b4)-usefulness for PrivateSVM-Finite.\n4Namely for di erentiable convex f and any a, b \u2208 R, (f \u2032(a)\u2212 f \u2032(b)) (a\u2212 b) \u2265 0.\nTheorem 8 (Utility of PrivateSVM-Finite). Consider any C > 0, n > 1, database D of n entries, arbitrary convex loss `, and nite F -dimensional feature mapping \u03c6 with kernel k and |\u03c6(x)i| \u2264 \u03a6 for all x \u2208 M and i \u2208 [F ] for some \u03a6 > 0 and M \u2286 Rd.

Proof. Our goal is to compare the SVM and PrivateSVM-Finite classi cations of any point x \u2208M:\u2223\u2223\u2223fM\u0302(D)(x)\u2212 fM(D)(x)\u2223\u2223\u2223 = |\u3008w\u0302, \u03c6(x)\u3009 \u2212 \u3008w\u0303, \u03c6(x)\u3009| = |\u3008\u00b5, \u03c6(x)\u3009| \u2264 \u2016\u00b5\u20161 \u2016\u03c6(x)\u2016\u221e \u2264 \u03a6 \u2016\u00b5\u20161 .\nThe absolute value of a zero mean Laplace random variable with scale parameter \u03bb is exponentially distributed with scale \u03bb\u22121. Moreover the sum of q i.i.d. exponential random variables has Erlang q-distribution with the same scale parameter.5 Thus we have, for Erlang F -distributed random variable X and any t > 0,\n\u2200x \u2208M, \u2223\u2223\u2223fM\u0302(D)(x)\u2212 fM(D)(x)\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u03a6X\n\u21d2 \u2200 > 0, Pr (\u2225\u2225\u2225fM\u0302(D) \u2212 fM(D)\u2225\u2225\u2225\u221e;M > ) \u2264 Pr (X > /\u03a6)\n= Pr ( etX > et /\u03a6 ) \u2264 E [ etX ]\ne t/\u03a6 .(3.4)\nHere we have employed the standard Cherno tail bound technique using Markov's inequality. The numerator of (3.4), the moment generating function of the Erlang F -distribution with parameter \u03bb, is (1 \u2212 \u03bbt)\u2212F for all t < \u03bb\u22121. Together with the choice of t = (2\u03bb)\u22121, this gives\nPr (\u2225\u2225\u2225fM\u0302(D) \u2212 fM(D)\u2225\u2225\u2225\u221e;M > ) \u2264 (1\u2212 \u03bbt)\u2212F e\u2212 t/\u03a6\n= 2F e\u2212 /(2\u03bb\u03a6)\n= exp (F loge 2\u2212 /(2\u03bb\u03a6)) . And provided that \u03bb \u2264 / ( 2\u03a6 ( F loge 2 + loge 1 \u03b4 )) this probability is bounded by \u03b4.\nOur second main result establishes that PrivateSVM-Finite is not only di erentially private, but that it releases a classi er that is similar to the SVM. Utility and privacy are competing properties, however, since utility demands that the noise not be too large."}, {"heading": "4. Mechanism for Translation-Invariant Kernels", "text": "Consider now the problem of privately learning in an RKHS H induced by an in nite dimensional feature mapping \u03c6. As a mechanism's response must be nitely encodable, the primal parametrization seems less appealing as it did in PrivateSVM-Finite. It is natural to look to the SVM's dual solution as a starting point: the Representer Theorem (Kimeldorf and Wahba, 1971) states that the optimizing f? \u2208 H must be in the span of the data a nite-dimensional subspace. While the coordinates in this subspace the \u03b1?i dual variables could be perturbed in the usual way to guarantee di erential privacy, the subspace's basis the data are also needed to parametrize f?. To side-step this apparent stumbling block, we take another approach by approximating H with a random RKHS H\u0302 induced by a random nite-dimensional map \u03c6\u0302. This then allows us to respond with a nite primal parametrization. Algorithm 3 summarizes the PrivateSVM mechanism.\nAs noted recently by Rahimi and Recht (2008), the Fourier transform p of the g function of a continuous positive-de nite translation-invariant kernel is a non-negative measure (Rudin, 1994). Rahimi and Recht\n5The Erlang q-distribution has density xq\u22121 exp(\u2212x/\u03bb) \u03bbq(q\u22121)! , CDF 1\u2212 e \u2212x/\u03bb Pq\u22121 j=0 (x/\u03bb)j j! , expectation q\u03bb and variance q\u03bb2.\nAlgorithm 3 PrivateSVM Inputs: database D = {(xi, yi)}ni=1 with xi \u2208 Rd, yi \u2208 {\u22121, 1}; translation-invariant kernel k(x,y) = g(x\u2212 y) with Fourier transform p(\u03c9) = 2\u22121 e\u2212j\u3008\u03c9,x\u3009g(x) dx; convex loss function `; parameters \u03bb,C > 0 and d\u0302 \u2208 N.

These vectors \u03c11, . . . ,\u03c1d\u0302 de ne the following random 2d\u0302-dimensional feature map\n\u03c6\u0302(\u00b7) = d\u0302\u22121/2 [ cos (\u3008\u03c11, \u00b7\u3009) , sin (\u3008\u03c11, \u00b7\u3009) , . . . , cos ( \u3008\u03c1d\u0302, \u00b7\u3009 ) , sin ( \u3008\u03c1d\u0302, \u00b7\u3009 )]T .(4.1) Inner-products in the random feature space approximate k(\u00b7, \u00b7) uniformly, and to arbitrary precision depending on parameter d\u0302, as restated in Lemma 13. We denote the inner-product in the random feature space by k\u0302. Rahimi and Recht (2008) applied this approximation to large-scale learning (situations where n is large). Instead of employing non-linear SVM's dual solution which takes O(n2) time, the primal solution to linear SVM on \u03c6\u0302 is used, as it takes time quadratic in d\u0302 to compute. For large-scale learning, good approximations can be found for d\u0302 n. Table 1 presents three important translation-invariant kernels and their transformations. PrivateSVM employs the same trick for translation-invariant kernels, but in a di erent setting. Here regularized ERM is performed in H\u0302, not to avoid complexity in n, but to provide a direct nite representation w\u0303 of the primal solution in the case of in nite dimensional feature spaces. After performing regularized ERM in H\u0302, appropriate Laplace noise is added to the primal solution w\u0303 to guarantee di erential privacy as before.\nPrivateSVM is computationally e cient. Algorithm 3 takes O(d\u0302) time to compute each entry of the kernel matrix, or a total time of O(d\u0302n2) on top of running dual SVM in the random feature space which is worst-case O(n3s) for the analytic solution (where ns \u2264 n is the number of support vectors), and faster using numerical methods such as chunking (Burges, 1998). To achieve ( , \u03b4)-usefulness wrt the hinge-loss SVM d\u0302 must be taken to be O ( d 4 ( log 1\u03b4 + log 1 )) (cf. Corollary 15). By comparison it takes O(dn2) to construct the kernel matrix for any translation-invariant kernel. As with the SVM and PrivateSVM-Finite, the response of Algorithm 3 can be used to make classi cations on future test points by constructing the classi er f\u0302?(\u00b7) = fw\u0302(\u00b7) = \u3008w\u0302, \u03c6\u0302(\u00b7)\u3009. Unlike the previous mechanisms, however, PrivateSVM must include a parametrization of feature map \u03c6\u0302 the sample {\u03c1i} d\u0302 i=1 in its response. Of PrivateSVM's total response, only w\u0302 depends on database D. The \u03c1i are data-independent vectors drawn from the transform p of the kernel, which we assume to be known by the adversary (to wit the adversary knows the mechanism itself, including k). Thus to establish di erential privacy we need only consider the data-dependent weight vector, fortunately we have already considered the similar case of PrivateSVM-Finite.\nCorollary 9 (Privacy of PrivateSVM). For any \u03b2 > 0, database D of size n, C > 0, d\u0302 \u2208 N, loss function `(y, y\u0302) that is convex and L-Lipschitz in y\u0302, and translation-invariant kernel k, PrivateSVM run on D with loss `, kernel k, noise parameter \u03bb \u2265 22.5LC \u221a d\u0302/(\u03b2n), approximation parameter d\u0302, and regularization parameter C guarantees \u03b2-di erential privacy.\nProof. The result follows immediately from Theorem 7 since w\u0303 is the primal solution of SVM with kernel k\u0302, the response vector w\u0302 = w\u0303 + \u00b5 for i.i.d. Laplace \u00b5, and k\u0302(x,x) = 1 for all x \u2208 RD.\nThis result is surprising, in that PrivateSVM is able to guarantee privacy for regularized ERM over a function class of in nite VC-dimension, where the obvious way to return the learned classi er (responding with the dual variables and feature mapping) reveals all the entries corresponding to the support vectors, completely.\nLike PrivateSVM-Finite, PrivateSVM is useful with respect to the SVM. If we denote the function parametrized by intermediate weight vector w\u0303 by f\u0303 , then the same argument for the utility of PrivateSVMFinite establishes the high-probability proximity of f\u0303 and f?.\nLemma 10. Consider a run of Algorithms 1 and 3 with d\u0302 \u2208 N, C > 0, convex loss and translation-invariant kernel. Denote by f\u0302? and f\u0303 the classi ers parametrized by weight vectors w\u0302 and w\u0303 respectively, where these vectors are related by w\u0302 = w\u0303 + \u00b5 with \u00b5 iid\u223c Laplace(0, \u03bb) in Algorithm 3.

As in the proof of Theorem 8 we can use the Cherno trick to show that, for Erlang 2d\u0302-distributed random variable X, the choice of t = (2\u03bb)\u22121,and for any > 0\nPr (\u2225\u2225\u2225f\u0302? \u2212 f\u0303\u2225\u2225\u2225\n\u221e > /2\n) \u2264 E [ etX ]\ne t \u221a d\u0302/2\n\u2264 (1\u2212 \u03bbt)\u22122d\u0302 e\u2212 t \u221a d\u0302/2 = 22d\u0302e\u2212 \u221a d\u0302/(4\u03bb)\n= exp ( d\u0302 loge 4\u2212 \u221a d\u0302/(4\u03bb) ) .\nProvided that \u03bb \u2264 / ( 24 loge 2 \u221a d\u0302 ) this is bounded by exp ( \u2212 \u221a d\u0302/(8\u03bb) ) . Moreover if \u03bb \u2264 \u221a d\u0302/ ( 8 loge 2 \u03b4 ) , then the claim follows.\nTo show a similar result for f? and f\u0303 , we exploit smoothness of the regularized ERM with respect to small changes in the RKHS itself. To the best of our knowledge, this kind of stability to the feature mapping has not been used before. We begin with a technical lemma that we will use to exploit the convexity of the regularized empirical risk functional.\nLemma 11. Let R be a functional on Hilbert space H satisfying R[f ] \u2265 R[f?]+ a2\u2016f \u2212f ?\u20162H for some a > 0, f? \u2208 H and all f \u2208 H. Then R[f ] \u2264 R[f?] + implies \u2016f \u2212 f?\u2016H\u0302 \u2264 \u221a 2 a , for all > 0, f \u2208 H.\nProof. By assumption and the antecedent\n\u2016f \u2212 f?\u20162H\u0302 \u2264 2 a (R[f ]\u2212R[f?])\n\u2264 2 a (R[f?] + \u2212R[f?]) = 2 /a .\nTaking square roots of both sides yields the consequent.\nProvided that the kernel functions k and k\u0302 are uniformly close, the next lemma exploits insensitivity of regularized ERM to perturbations of the feature mapping to show that f? and f\u0303 are pointwise close. Lemma 22 re-proves this result for non-di erentiable loss functions.\nLemma 12. Let H be an RKHS with translation-invariant kernel k, and let H\u0302 be the random RKHS corresponding to feature map (4.1) induced by k. Let C be a positive scalar and loss `(y, y\u0302) be di erentiable, convex, and L-Lipschitz in y\u0302.

Proof. Denote the empirical risk functional by Remp[f ] = n\u22121 \u2211n i=1 ` (yi, f(xi)) and the regularized empirical risk functional Rreg[f ] = C Remp[f ] + \u2016f\u20162/2, for the appropriate RKHS norm (either H or H\u0302). Let f? denote the regularized empirical risk minimizer in H, given by parameter vector \u03b1?, and let g? denote the regularized empirical risk minimizer in H\u0302 given by parameter vector \u03b2?. Let g\u03b1? = \u2211n i=1 \u03b1 ? i yi\u03c6\u0302(xi) and\nf\u03b2? = \u2211n i=1 \u03b2 ? i yi\u03c6(xi) denote the images of f ? and g? under the natural mapping between the spans of the data in RKHS's H\u0302 and H respectively. We will rst show that these four functions have arbitrarily close regularized empirical risk in their respective RKHS, and then that this implies uniform proximity of the functions themselves.

Consider any database D, compact set M \u2282 Rd containing D, convex loss `, translation-invariant kernel k, and scalars C, > 0 and \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1). Suppose the SVM with loss `, kernel k and parameter C has dual variables with L1-norm bounded by \u039b. Then Algorithm 3 run on D with\nloss `, kernel k, parameters d\u0302 \u2265 4(d+2)\u03b8( ) loge ( 29(\u03c3pdiam(M))2 \u03b4\u03b8( ) ) where \u03b8( ) = min { 1,\n4 24 \u201c \u039b+2 \u221a (CL+\u039b/2)\u039b \u201d4 } ,\n\u03bb \u2264 min {\n24 loge 2 \u221a d\u0302 , \u221a d\u0302 8 loge 2 \u03b4\n} and C is ( , \u03b4)-useful with respect to Algorithm 1 run on D with loss `, kernel\nk and parameter C, wrt the \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e;M-norm.\nProof. Lemma's 12 and 10 combined via the triangle inequality, with Lemma 13, together establish the result as follows. De ne A to be the conditioning event regarding the approximation of k by k\u0302, denote the events in Lemma's 12 and 8 by B and C (beware we are overloading C with the regularization parameter; its meaning will be apparent from the context), and the target event in the theorem by D.\nA = \u2225\u2225\u2225k\u0302 \u2212 k\u2225\u2225\u2225\u221e;M < min 1, 222\u201e\u039b+2q(CL+ \u039b2 )\u039b\u00ab2  \nB = {\u2225\u2225\u2225f? \u2212 f\u0303\u2225\u2225\u2225\n\u221e;M \u2264 /2\n} C = {\u2225\u2225\u2225f\u0302? \u2212 f\u0303\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u221e \u2264 /2 } D = {\u2225\u2225\u2225f? \u2212 f\u0302?\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u221e;M \u2264 }\nThe claim is a bound on Pr(D). By the triangle inequality events B and C together imply D. Second note that event C is independent of A and B. Thus Pr(D | A) \u2265 Pr(B \u2229 C | A) = Pr(B | A) Pr(C) \u2265 1 \u00b7 (1 \u2212 \u03b4/2), for su ciently small \u03bb. Finally Lemma 13 bounds Pr(A) as follows: provided that d\u0302 \u2265\n4(d + 2) loge ( 29 (\u03c3pdiam(M))2 / (\u03b4\u03b8( )) ) /\u03b8( ) where \u03b8( ) = min { 1, 4/ [ 2 ( \u039b + 2 \u221a (CL+ \u039b/2) \u039b )]4} we\nhave Pr(A) \u2265 1\u2212 \u03b4/2. Together this yields Pr(D) = Pr(D | A) Pr(A) \u2265 (1\u2212 \u03b4/2)2 \u2265 1\u2212 \u03b4.\nAgain we see that utility and privacy place competing constraints on the level of noise \u03bb. Next we will use these interactions to upper-bound the optimal di erential privacy of the SVM."}, {"heading": "5. Hinge-Loss and an Upper Bound on Optimal Differential Privacy", "text": "We begin by `plugging' hinge loss `(y, y\u0302) = (1 \u2212 yy\u0302)+ into the main results on privacy and utility of the previous section (similar computations can be done for PrivateSVM-Finite and other convex loss functions).

The rst result follows from Theorem 7 and the fact that hinge-loss is convex and 1-Lipschitz on R: i.e., \u2202y\u0302` = 1[1 \u2265 yy\u0302] \u2264 1. The second result follows almost immediately from Theorem 14. For hinge-loss we have that feasible \u03b1i's are bounded by C/n (and so \u039b = C) by the dual's box constraints and that L = 1,\nimplying we take \u03b8( ) = min { 1, 4\n24C4(1+ \u221a 6)4\n} . This is bounded by the stated \u03b8( ).\nCombining the competing requirements on noise level \u03bb upper-bounds optimal di erential privacy of hinge-loss SVM.\nTheorem 16. The optimal di erential privacy for hinge-loss SVM learning on translation-invariant kernel k is bounded by \u03b2( , \u03b4, C, n, `, k) = O (\n1 3n \u221a log 1\u03b4 ( log 1 + log 2 1 \u03b4 )) .\nProof. Consider hinge loss in Corollary 15. Privacy places a lower bound of \u03b2 \u2265 22.5C \u221a d\u0302/(\u03bbn) for any chosen \u03bb, which we can convert to a lower bound on \u03b2 in terms of and \u03b4 as follows. For small , we have\n\u03b8( ) = 42\u221212C\u22124 and so to achieve ( , \u03b4)-usefulness we must take d\u0302 = O (\n1 4 loge ( 1 \u03b4 4 )) . There are two\ncases for utility, if \u03bb = / ( 24 loge ( 2 \u221a d\u0302 )) then \u03b2 = O (\u221a d\u0302 loge \u221a d\u0302\nn\n) = O ( 1 3n \u221a log 1\u03b4 ( log 1 + log 2 1 \u03b4 )) .\nOtherwise we are in the second case, with \u03bb = \u221a d\u0302\n8 loge 2 \u03b4\nyielding \u03b2 = O (\n1 n log 1 \u03b4\n) which is dominated by the\nrst case as \u2193 0.\nA natural question arises from this discussion: given any mechanism that is ( , \u03b4)-useful with respect to hinge SVM, for how small a \u03b2 can we possibly hope to guarantee \u03b2-di erential privacy? In other words, what lower bounds exist for the optimal di erential privacy for the SVM?\n6. Lower Bounding Optimal Differential Privacy\nTo lower bound \u03b2 for any ( , \u03b4)-useful mechanism, we rst establish a negative sensitivity result for the SVM, by constructing two neighboring databases on which SVM classi ers di er. Lemma 17. For any C > 0, n > 1 and 0 < < \u221a C\n2n , there exists a pair of neighboring databases D1, D2 on n entries, such that the functions f?1 , f ? 2 parametrized by SVM run with parameter C, linear kernel, and hinge loss on D1, D2 respectively, satisfy \u2016f?1 \u2212 f?2 \u2016\u221e > 2 .\nProof. We construct the two databases on the line as follows. Let 0 < m < M be scalars to be chosen later. Both databases share negative examples x1 = . . . = xbn/2c = \u2212M and positive examples xbn/2c+1 = . . . = xn\u22121 = M . Each database has xn = M \u2212m, with yn = \u22121 for D1 and yn = 1 for D2. In what follows we use subscripts to denote an example's parent database, so (xi,j , yi,j) is the jth example from Di. Consider the result of running primal SVM on each database\nw?1 = arg min w\u2208R 1 2 w2 + C n n\u2211 i=1 (1\u2212 y1,iwx1,i)+\nw?2 = arg min w\u2208R 1 2 w2 + C n n\u2211 i=1 (1\u2212 y2,iwx2,i)+ .\nEach optimization is strictly convex and unconstrained, so the optimizing w?1 , w ? 2 are characterized by the\nrst-order KKT conditions 0 \u2208 \u2202wfi(w) for fi being the objective function for learning on Di, and \u2202w denoting the subdi erential operator. Now for each i \u2208 [2]\n\u2202wfi(w) = w \u2212 C\nn n\u2211 j=1 yi,jxi,j 1\u0303 [1\u2212 yi,jwxi,j ] ,\nwhere\n1\u0303[x] =  {0} , if x < 0 [0, 1] , if x = 0 {1} , if x > 0\nis the subdi erential of (x)+. Thus for each i \u2208 [2], w?i \u2208 Cn \u2211n j=1 yi,jxi,j 1\u0303 [1\u2212 yi,jw?i xi,j ] which is equivalent to\nw?1 \u2208 CM(n\u2212 1) n 1\u0303 [ 1 M \u2212 w?1 ] + C(m\u2212M) n 1\u0303 [ w?1 \u2212 1 m\u2212M ] w?2 \u2208\nCM(n\u2212 1) n\n1\u0303 [\n1 M \u2212 w?2\n] + C(M \u2212m) n 1\u0303 [ 1 M \u2212m \u2212 w?2 ] .\nThe RHSs of these conditions correspond to decreasing piecewise-constant functions, and the conditions are met when the corresponding functions intersect with the diagonal y = x line, as shown in Figure 6. If C(M(n\u22122)+m)\nn < 1 M then w ? 1 = C(M(n\u22122)+m) n . And if C(Mn\u2212m) n < 1 M then w ? 2 = C(Mn\u2212m) n . So provided that\n1 M > C(Mn\u2212m) n = max\n{ C(M(n\u22122)+m)\nn , C(Mn\u2212m) n } , we have |w?1 \u2212 w?2 | = 2Cn |M \u2212m|. So taking M = 2n C\nand m = n C , this implies\n\u2016f?1 \u2212 f?2 \u2016\u221e \u2265 |f ? 1 (1)\u2212 f?2 (1)|\n= |w?1 \u2212 w?2 | = 2 ,\nprovided < \u221a C\n2n .\nTheorem 18 (Lower bound on optimal di erential privacy for hinge loss SVM). For any C > 0, n > 1, \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1) and \u2208 ( 0, \u221a C\n2n\n) , the optimal di erential privacy for the hinge-loss SVM with linear kernel is\nlower-bounded by loge 1\u2212\u03b4 \u03b4 . In other words, for any C, \u03b2 > 0 and n > 1 if a mechanism M\u0302 is ( , \u03b4)-useful and \u03b2-di erentially private then either \u2265 \u221a C\n2n or \u03b4 \u2265 exp(\u2212\u03b2).\nProof. Consider ( , \u03b4)-useful mechanism M\u0302 with respect to SVM learning mechanism M with parameter C > 0, hinge loss and linear kernel on n training examples, where \u03b4 > 0 and \u221a C\n2n > > 0. By Lemma 17 there exists a pair of neighboring databasesD1, D2 on n entries, such that \u2016f?1\u2212f?2 \u2016\u221e > 2 where f?i = fM(Di) for each i \u2208 [2]. Let f\u0302i = fM\u0302(Di) for each i \u2208 [2]. Then by the utility of M\u0302 ,\nPr ( f\u03021 \u2208 B\u221e (f?1 ) ) \u2265 1\u2212 \u03b4 ,(6.1)\nPr ( f\u03022 \u2208 B\u221e (f?1 ) ) \u2264 Pr ( f\u03022 /\u2208 B\u221e (f?2 ) ) < \u03b4 .(6.2)\nLet P\u03021 and P\u03022 be the distributions of M\u0302(D1) and M\u0302(D2) respectively so that P\u0302i(t) = Pr ( M\u0302(Di) = t ) .\nThen by Inequalities (6.1) and (6.2) ET\u223cP1 [ dP2(T ) dP1(T ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 T \u2208 B\u221e (f?1 )] = B\u221e (f?1 ) dP2(t) dP1(t)dP1(t)\nB\u221e (f?1 ) dP1(t)\n\u2264 \u03b4 1\u2212 \u03b4 .\nThus there exists a t such that log Pr(M\u0302(D1)=t) Pr(M\u0302(D2)=t) \u2265 log 1\u2212\u03b4 \u03b4 .\nThe same technique can be extended to prove a stronger lower bound. First we construct a set of N > 1 neighboring databases having SVM images that are a 2 -packing. To achieve this for any N we move from linear to RBF kernel.\nLemma 19. For any C > 0, n > C, 0 < < C4n , and 0 < \u03c3 < \u221a 1 2 loge 2 there exists a set of N = \u230a 2 \u03c3 \u221a 2 loge 2 \u230b pairwise-neighboring databases {Di}Ni=1 on n examples, such that the functions f?i parametrized by hinge-loss SVM run on Di with parameter C and RBF kernel with parameter \u03c3, satisfy\n\u2225\u2225f?i \u2212 f?j \u2225\u2225\u221e > 2 for each i 6= j.\nProof. Construct N > 1 pairwise neighboring databases each on n examples in R2 as follows.

Thus four cases are possible: the solution lies in the interior of the feasible set, or one or both upper box-constraints hold with equality. Noting that 1(n\u22121)(1\u2212\u03b3) \u2264 1 1\u2212\u03b3 it follows that \u03b1 ? is feasible i 11\u2212\u03b3 \u2264 C n . This is equivalent to C \u2265 11\u2212\u03b3n > n, since \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1). This corresponds to under-regularization. If both constraints hold with equality we have \u03b1? = Cn 1, which is always feasible.\nIn the case where the rst constraint holds with equality \u03b1?1 = C n , the second dual variable is found by\noptimizing\n\u03b1?2 = max \u03b12\u2208R\n\u03b1\u2032 ( n\u2212 1\n1\n) \u2212 1 2 \u03b1\u2032 ( (n\u2212 1)2 \u2212\u03b3(n\u2212 1) \u2212\u03b3(n\u2212 1) 1 ) \u03b1\n= max \u03b12\u2208R C(n\u2212 1) n + \u03b12 \u2212 1 2\n(( C(n\u2212 1)\nn\n)2 \u2212 2C\u03b3(n\u2212 1)\nn \u03b12 + \u03b122\n)\n= max \u03b12\u2208R \u22121 2 \u03b122 + \u03b12\n( 1 +\nC\u03b3(n\u2212 1) n\n) ,\nimplying \u03b1?2 = 1 + C\u03b3 n\u22121 n .

Finally in the case where the second constraint holds with equality \u03b1?2 = C n , the rst dual is found by optimizing\n\u03b1?2 = max \u03b11\u2208R\n\u03b1\u2032 ( n\u2212 1\n1\n) \u2212 1 2 \u03b1\u2032 ( (n\u2212 1)2 \u2212\u03b3(n\u2212 1) \u2212\u03b3(n\u2212 1) 1 ) \u03b1\n= max \u03b11\u2208R\n(n\u2212 1)\u03b11 + C n \u2212 1 2\n( (n\u2212 1)2\u03b121 \u2212 2C\u03b3\nn\u2212 1 n \u03b11 + C2 n2 ) = max\n\u03b12\u2208R \u22121 2 (n\u2212 1)2\u03b121 + \u03b11\n( 1 + C\u03b3\nn\n) ,\nimplying \u03b1?1 = 1+C\u03b3n (n\u22121)2 . This is feasible provided 1+C\u03b3n (n\u22121)2 \u2264 C n . Passing back to the program on n variables, by the invariance of the duals to the database, for any pair Di, Dj\n|fi (xi,n)\u2212 fj (xi,n)| = \u03b1?n (1\u2212 k (xi,n,xj,n)) \u2265 \u03b1?n (\n1\u2212max q 6=i\nk (xi,n,xq,n) ) .\nNow a simple argument shows that this maximum is equal to \u03b34 exp ( sin2 \u03c0N ) for all i. The maximum objective is optimized when |q\u2212 i| = 1. In this case |\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8q| = 2\u03c0N . The norm \u2016xi,n \u2212 xq,n\u2016 = 2 sin |\u03b8i\u2212\u03b8q| 2 = 2 sin \u03c0 N by\nbasic geometry. Thus k (xi,n,xq,n) = exp ( \u2212\u2016xi,n\u2212xq,n\u2016 2\n2\u03c32\n) = exp ( \u2212 2\u03c32 sin 2 \u03c0 N ) = \u03b34 exp ( sin2 \u03c0N ) as claimed.\nNotice that N \u2265 2 so the second term is in (1, e], while the rst term is in (0, 1). In summary we have shown that for any i 6= j\n|fi (xi,n)\u2212 fj (xi,n)| \u2265 ( 1\u2212 exp ( \u2212 2 \u03c32 sin2 \u03c0 N )) \u03b1?n .\nAssume \u03b3 < 12 . If n > C then n > C 2 > (1 \u2212 \u03b3)C in which implies case 1 is infeasible. Similarly since C\u03b3 n\u22121n > 0, n > C implies 1 +C\u03b3 n\u22121 n > 1 > C n which implies case 3 is infeasible. Thus provided that \u03b3 < 1 2 and n > C we have that either case 2 or case 4 must hold. In both cases \u03b1?n = C n giving\n|fi (xi,n)\u2212 fj (xi,n)| \u2265 ( 1\u2212 exp ( \u2212 2 \u03c32 sin2 \u03c0 N )) C n .\nProvided that \u03c3 \u2264 \u221a\n2 log 2 sin \u03c0 N we have\n( 1\u2212 exp ( \u2212 2\u03c32 sin 2 \u03c0 N )) C n \u2265 ( 1\u2212 12 ) C n = C 2n . Now for small x we\ncan take the linear approximation sinx \u2265 x\u03c0/2 for x \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2]. If N \u2265 2 then sin \u03c0 N \u2265 2 N . Thus in this case we can take \u03c3 \u2264 \u221a\n2 log 2 2 N to imply |fi (xi,n)\u2212 fj (xi,n)| \u2265 C 2n . This bound on \u03c3 in turn implies the following bound on \u03b3: \u03b3 = exp ( \u2212 12\u03c32 ) \u2264 exp ( \u2212N 2 loge 2 24 ) . Thus taking N > 4, in conjunction with \u03c3 \u2264 \u221a 2 log 2 2 N\nimplies \u03b3 \u2264 12 . Rather than selecting N which bounds \u03c3, we can choose N in terms of \u03c3. \u03c3 \u2264 \u221a 2 log 2 2 N is\nimplied by N = 2\u03c3 \u221a 2 loge 2 . So for small \u03c3 we can construct more databases leading to the desired separation.\nFinally, N > 4 implies that we must constrain \u03c3 < \u221a\n1 2 loge 2 .\nIn summary, if n > C and \u03c3 < \u221a\n1 2 loge 2 then |fi (xi,n)\u2212 fj (xi,n)| \u2265 C2n for each i 6= j \u2208 [N ] where N = \u230a\n2 \u03c3\n\u221a 2\nloge 2\n\u230b . Moreover if \u2264 C4n then for any i 6= j this implies \u2016fi \u2212 fj\u2016\u221e \u2265 2 as claimed.\nTheorem 20 (Strong lower bound on optimal di erential privacy for hinge loss). For C > 0, n > C, \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1), \u2208 ( 0, n4C ) , and \u03c3 < \u221a 1 2 loge 2 the optimal di erential privacy for the hinge SVM with RBF kernel having parameter \u03c3 is lower-bounded by loge (1\u2212\u03b4)(N\u22121) \u03b4 , where N = \u230a 2 \u03c3 \u221a 2\nloge 2\n\u230b . That is, under these\nconditions, all mechanisms that are ( , \u03b4)-useful wrt hinge SVM with RBF kernel for any \u03c3 do not achieve di erential privacy at any level.\nProof. Consider ( , \u03b4)-useful mechanism M\u0302 with respect to hinge SVM learning mechanism M with parameter C > 0 and RBF kernel with parameter 0 < \u03c3 < \u221a 1\n2 loge 2 on n training examples, where \u03b4 > 0 and\nn 4C > > 0. Let N = \u230a 2 \u03c3 \u221a 2\nloge 2\n\u230b > 4. By Lemma 19 there exist pairwise neighboring databases D1, . . . , DN\nof n entries, such that {f?i } N i=1 is an -packing wrt the L\u221e-norm, where f ? i = fM(Di). So by the utility of M\u0302 , for each i \u2208 [N ]\nPr ( f\u0302i \u2208 B\u221e (f?i ) ) \u2265 1\u2212 \u03b4 ,(6.3) \u2211\nj 6=1\nPr ( f\u03021 \u2208 B\u221e ( f?j )) \u2264 Pr ( f\u03021 /\u2208 B\u221e (f?1 ) ) < \u03b4 ,\n\u21d2 \u2203j 6= 1, Pr ( f\u03021 \u2208 B\u221e ( f?j )) < \u03b4\nN \u2212 1 .(6.4) Let P\u03021 and P\u0302j be the distributions of M\u0302(D1) and M\u0302(Dj) respectively so that for each, P\u0302i(t) = Pr ( M\u0302(Di) = t ) .\nThen by Inequalities (6.3) and (6.4) ET\u223cPj [ dP1(T ) dPj(T ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 T \u2208 B\u221e (f?j )] = B\u221e (f?j ) dP1(t) dPj(t)dPj(t)\nB\u221e (f?j ) dPj(t)\n\u2264 \u03b4 (1\u2212 \u03b4)(N \u2212 1) .\nThus there exists a t such that log Pr(M\u0302(Dj)=t) Pr(M\u0302(D1)=t) \u2265 log (1\u2212\u03b4)(N\u22121) \u03b4 .\nNote that n > C is a weak condition, since C should grow like \u221a n for universal consistency.

Conclusion & Open Problems", "text": "We have presented a pair of new mechanisms for private SVM learning. In each case we have established di erential privacy via the algorithmic stability of regularized empirical risk minimization. To achieve utility under in nite-dimensional feature mappings, we perform regularized ERM in a random Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space whose kernel approximates the target RKHS kernel. This trick, borrowed from large-scale learning, permits the mechanism to privately respond with a nite representation of a maximum-margin hyperplane classi er. We then established the high-probability, pointwise similarity between the resulting function and the SVM classi er through a new smoothness result of regularized ERM with respect to perturbations of the RKHS. The bounds on di erential privacy and utility combine to upper bound the optimal di erential privacy of SVM learning for hinge-loss. This quantity is the optimal level of privacy among all mechanisms that are ( , \u03b4)-useful with respect to the hinge-loss SVM. Finally, we derived a lower bound on this quantity which established that any mechanism that is too accurate with respect to the hinge SVM with RBF kernel, with any non-trivial probability, cannot be \u03b2-di erentially private for small \u03b2. The lower bounds explicitly depend on the variance of the RBF kernel.\nAn interesting open problem is to derive lower bounds holding for moderate to large . Another direction for future research is to extend our mechanisms to other kernel methods. Finally, a general connection between algorithmic stability and global sensitivity would immediately suggest a number of practical privacypreserving learning mechanisms."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Ali Rahimi for helpful discussions relating to this research.

Proofs for Subdifferentiable Loss Functions", "text": "The main results were stated in terms of non-di erentiable convex loss functions so that they would hold for the hinge loss, however the proofs in the main text applied to di erentiable loss functions only. For completeness we now re-prove the appropriate lemma's for subdi erentiable loss functions of which general convex loss functions are a special case.\nIn each case the proofs for subdi erentiable loss are essentially identical to the di erentiable loss proofs: we discuss only the arguments that change when generalizing to non-di erentiable loss functions. Previously \u2202w referred to the gradient operator, now it refers to the subdi erential operator. The subscript reminds us that we are viewing the operand as a function of w only. Similarly other subscripts extend the notion of other partial derivatives. Previously there was a unique gradient at each point, now there may be many subgradients, making up the subdi erential set at a point. As we are dealing with sets of subgradients, we use the shorthand that for sets S, T , vector v and scalar a that: S + T = {g + h | g \u2208 S, h \u2208 T}, aS = {ag | g \u2208 S}, S+v = {g + v | g \u2208 S}, \u3008S,v\u3009 = {\u3008g,v\u3009 | g \u2208 S} and S \u2265 T means g \u2265 h for all (g, h) \u2208 S\u00d7T .\nLemma 21 generalizes Lemma 6 on the sensitivity of the SVM primal weight vector, to general (i.e., subdi erentiable) convex loss functions.\nLemma 21.

Denote the empirical risk functional Remp[f ] = n\u22121 \u2211n i=1 ` (yi, f(xi)) and the regularized empirical risk functional Rreg[f ] = C Remp[f ] + \u2016f\u20162/2, for the appropriate RKHS norm (either H or H\u0302). Let f? denote the regularized empirical risk minimizer in H, given by parameter vector \u03b1?, and let g? denote the regularized empirical risk minimizer in H\u0302 given by parameter vector \u03b2?. Let g\u03b1? = \u2211n i=1 \u03b1 ? i yi\u03c6\u0302(xi) and\nf\u03b2? = \u2211n i=1 \u03b2 ? i yi\u03c6(xi) denote the images of f ? and g? under the natural mapping between the spans of the data in RKHS's H\u0302 and H respectively. We will rst show that these four functions have arbitrarily close regularized empirical risk in their respective RKHS, and then that this implies uniform proximity of the functions themselves.

The subsequent equality holds by \u2202gR H\u0302 reg[g] = C \u2202gRemp[g] + g.

To side-step this apparent stumbling block, we take another approach by approximating H with a random RKHS \u0124 induced by a random nite-dimensional map \u03c6\u0302. This then allows us to respond with a nite primal parametrization. Algorithm 3 summarizes the PrivateSVM mechanism.

In this paper we study this trade-o in private Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning. We present two e cient mechanisms, one for the case of nite-dimensional feature mappings and one for potentially in nite-dimensional feature mappings with translation-invariant kernels. For the case of translation-invariant kernels, the proposed mechanism minimizes regularized empirical risk in a random Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space whose kernel uniformly approximates the desired kernel with high probability. This technique, borrowed from large-scale learning, allows the mechanism to respond with a nite encoding of the classi er, even when the function class is of in nite VC dimension. Di erential privacy is established using a proof technique from algorithmic stability. Utility the mechanism's response function is pointwise -close to non-private SVM with probability 1\u2212 \u03b4 is proven by appealing to the smoothness of regularized empirical risk minimization with respect to small perturbations to the feature mapping. We conclude with a lower bound on the optimal di erential privacy of the SVM.
