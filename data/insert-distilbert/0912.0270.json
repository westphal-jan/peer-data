path-planning problem consists in finding a suitable plan for each new configuration of the environment by recomputing a collision-free path using the new information available at each time step [HA92]. This kind of problem has to be solved for example by a robot trying to navigate through an area crowded with people, such as a shopping mall or supermarket. The problem has been widely addressed in its several flavors, such as cellular decomposition of the configuration space [Ste95], partial environmental knowledge [Ste94], high-dimensional configuration spaces [KSLO96] or planning with non-holonomic constraints [LKJ99]. However, even simpler variations of this problem are complex enough that they can not be solved with deterministic techniques, and therefore are worthy of study.\nThis thesis is focused on algorithms for finding and traversing a collision-free path in two dimensional space, for a holonomic robot1, without kinodynamic restrictions2, in a highly dynamic environment, but for comparison purposes three different scenarios will be tested:\n\u2022 Several unpredictably moving obstacles or adversaries.\n\u2022 Partially known environment, where some obstacles become visible when the robot approaches each one of them.\n1A holonomic robot is a robot in which the controllable degrees of freedom is equal to the total degrees of freedom.\n2Kinodynamic planning is a problem in which velocity and acceleration bounds must be satisfied\n1\n\u2022 Totally unknown environment, where every obstacle is initially invisible to the planner, and only becomes visible when the robot approaches it.\nBesides the obstacles in the second and third scenario we assume that we have perfect information of the environment at all times.\nWe will focus on continuous space algorithms and will not consider algorithms that use a discretized representation of the configuration space3, such as D* [Ste95], because for high dimensional problems the configuration space becomes intractable in terms of both memory and computation time, and there is the extra difficulty of calculating the discretization size, trading off accuracy versus computational cost. Only single agent algorithms will be considered here. On-line as well as off-line algorithms will be studied. An on-line algorithm is one that is permanently adjusting its solution as the environment changes, while an off-line algorithm computes a solution only once (however, it can be executed many times).\nThe offline Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) is efficient at finding solutions, but the results are far from optimal, and must be post-processed for shortening, smoothing or other qualities that might be desirable in each particular problem. Furthermore, replanning RRTs are costly in terms of computation time, as are evolutionary and cell-decomposition approaches. Therefore, the novelty of this work is the mixture of the feasibility benefits of the RRTs, the repairing capabilities of local search, and the computational inexpensiveness of greedy algorithms, into our lightweight multi-stage algorithm. Our working hypothesis will be that a multi-stage algorithm, using different techniques for initial planning and navigation, outperforms current probabilistic sampling techniques in highly dynamic environments"}, {"heading": "1.1 Problem Formulation", "text": "At each time-step, the problem could be defined as an optimization problem with satisfiability constraints. Therefore, given a path our objective is to minimize an evaluation function (i.e., distance, time, or path-points), with the Cfree constraint.\n3the space of possible positions that a physical system may attain\n2\nFormally, let the path \u03c1 = p1p2 . . . pn be a sequence of points, where pi \u2208 Rn is a ndimensional point (p1 = qinit, pn = qgoal), Ot \u2208 O the set of obstacles positions at time t, and eval : Rn \u00d7O 7\u2192 R an evaluation function of the path depending on the object positions.

For simplicity, we use very naive eval(\u00b7, \u00b7) and feas(\u00b7, \u00b7) functions, but our approach could be extended easily to more complex evaluation and feasibility functions. The feas(\u03c1,Ot) function used assumes that the robot is a point object in space, and therefore if no segments \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192pipi+1 of the path collide with any object oj \u2208 Ot, we say that the path is in Cfree. The eval(\u03c1,Ot) function is the length of the path, i.e., the sum of the distances between consecutive points. This could be easily changed to any other metric such as the time it would take to traverse this path, accounting for smoothness, clearness or several other optimization criteria."}, {"heading": "1.2 Document Structure", "text": "In the following sections we present several path planning methods that can be applied to the problem described above.

It can also optimize the solution according to any given fitness function without the need for a post-processing step."}, {"heading": "2.1 Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree", "text": "One of the most successful probabilistic methods for offline path planning currently in use is the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT), a single-query planner for static environments, first introduced in [Lav98]. RRTs works towards finding a continuous path from a state qinit to a state qgoal in the free configuration space Cfree by building a tree rooted at qinit. A new state qrand is uniformly sampled at random from the configuration space C. Then the nearest node, qnear, in the tree is located, and if qrand and the shortest path from qrand to qnear are in Cfree, then qrand is added to the tree\n5\n(algorithm 1). The tree growth is stopped when a node is found near qgoal. To speed up convergence, the search is usually biased to qgoal with a small probability.\nIn [KL00], two new features are added to RRT. First, the EXTEND function (algorithm 2) is introduced, which instead of trying to add qrand directly to the tree, makes a motion towards qrand and tests for collisions.\nAlgorithm 1 BuildRRT(qinit, qgoal)\n1: T \u2190 empty tree 2: T. init(qinit) 3: while Distance(T, qgoal) > threshold do 4: qrand \u2190 RandomConfig() 5: Extend(T, qrand) 6: return T\nAlgorithm 2 Extend(T, q)\n1: qnear \u2190 NearestNeighbor(q, T ) 2: if NewConfig(q, qnear, qnew) then 3: T. add vertex(qnew) 4: T. add edge(qnear, qnew) 5: if qnew = q then 6: return Reached 7: else 8: return Advanced 9: return Trapped\nThen a greedier approach is introduced (the CONNECT function, shown in algorithms 3 and 4), which repeats EXTEND until an obstacle is reached. This ensures that most of the time we will be adding states to the tree, instead of just rejecting new random states. The second extension is the use of two trees, rooted at qinit and qgoal, which are grown towards each other (see figure 2.1). This significantly decreases the time needed to find a path.\n6\nAlgorithm 3 RRTConnectPlanner(qinit, qgoal)\n1: Ta \u2190 tree rooted at qinit 2: Tb \u2190 tree rooted at qgoal 3: Ta. init(qinit) 4: Tb. init(qgoal) 5: for k = 1 to K do 6: qrand \u2190 RandomConfig() 7: if not (Extend(Ta, qrand) = Trapped) then 8: if Connect(Tb, qnew) = Reached then 9: return Path(Ta, Tb)\n10: Swap(Ta, Tb) 11: return Failure\nAlgorithm 4 Connect(T, q)\n1: repeat 2: S \u2190 Extend(T, q) 3: until (S 6= Advanced)\n7"}, {"heading": "2.2 Retraction-Based RRT Planner", "text": "The Retraction-based RRT Planner presented in [ZM08] aims at improving the performance of the standard offline RRT in static environments with narrow passages. The basic idea of the Optimize(qr, qn) function in algorithm 5 is to iteratively retract a randomly generated configuration that is in Cobs to the closest boundary point in Cfree. So, instead of using the standard extension that tries to extend in a straight line from qnear to qrand, it extends from qnear to the closest point in Cfree to qrand. This gives more samples in narrow passages. This technique could easily be applied to on-line RRT planners.\nAlgorithm 5 Retraction-based RRT Extension\n1: qr \u2190 a random configuration in Cspace 2: qn \u2190 the nearest neighbor of qr in T 3: if CollisionFree(qn, qr) then 4: T. addVertex(qr) 5: T. addEdge(qn, qr) 6: else 7: S \u2190 Optimize(qr, qn) 8: for all qi \u2208 S do 9: Standard RRT Extension(T, qi)\n10: return T"}, {"heading": "2.3 Execution Extended RRT", "text": "The Execution Extended RRT presented in [BV02] introduces two extensions to RRT to build an on-line planner, the waypoint cache and adaptive cost penalty search, which improve re-planning efficiency and the quality of generated paths. ERRT uses a kd-tree (see section 2.7) to speed nearest neighbor look-up, and does not use bidirectional search. The waypoint cache is implemented by keeping a constant size array of states, and whenever a plan is found, all the states in the plan are placed in the cache with random replacement. Then, when the tree is no longer valid, a new tree must be\n8\ngrown, and there are three possibilities for choosing a new target state, as shown in algorithm 6, which is used instead of RandomConfig() in previous algorithms. With probability P[goal ], the goal is chosen as the target; with probability P[waypoint ], a random waypoint is chosen, and with the remaining probability a uniform state is chosen as before.

It is inspired in biological evolution, using methods such as individual selection, reproduction and mutation. The population is composed of candidate solutions and they are evaluated according to a fitness function.\nThe Evolutionary Planner/Navigator presented in [XMZ96], [XMZT97], and [TX97] is an evolutionary algorithm for path finding in dynamic environments. A high level description is shown in algorithm 15. A difference with RRT is that it can optimize the path according to any fitness function defined (length, smoothness, etc), without the need for a post-processing step. Experimental tests have shown it has good performance for sparse maps, but no so much for difficult maps with narrow passages or too crowded with obstacles. However, when a feasible path is found, it is very efficient at optimizing it and adapting to the dynamic obstacles. Every individual in the population is a sequence of nodes, representing nodes in a path consisting of straight-line segments. Each node consists of an (x, y) pair and a state variable b with information about the feasibility of the point and the path segment connecting it to the next point. Individuals have variable length.\nSince a path p can be either feasible or unfeasible, two evaluation functions are used. For feasible paths (equation 2.1), the goal is to minimize distance traveled, maintain a smooth trajectory and satisfy a clearance requirement (the robot should not approach the obstacles too closely). For unfeasible paths, we use equation 2.2, taken from [Xia97], where \u00b5 is the number of intersections of a whole path with obstacles and \u03b7 is the average number of intersections per unfeasible segment.\nevalf (p) = wd \u00b7 dist(p) + ws \u00b7 smooth(p) + wc \u00b7 clear(p) (2.1)\nevalu(p) = \u00b5+ \u03b7 (2.2)\nEP/N uses eight different operators, as shown in figure 2.2 (description taken\nfrom [XMZ96]):\nCrossover: Recombines two (parent) paths into two new paths.

If the\npath is unfeasible, the deletion is done randomly. Otherwise, the operator decides whether a node should definitely be deleted based on some heuristic knowledge, and if a node is not definitely deletable, its deletion will be random.\nSwap: Swaps the coordinates of randomly selected adjacent nodes in a path, which\ncan be either feasible or unfeasible.\nSmooth: Smoothens turns of a feasible path by \u201ccutting corners,\u201d i.e., for a selected\nnode, the operator inserts two new nodes on the two path segments connected to that node respectively and deletes that selected node. The nodes with sharper turns are more likely to be selected.\nRepair: Repairs a randomly selected unfeasible segment in a path by \u201cpulling\u201d the\n17\nsegment around its intersecting obstacle.\nThe probabilities of using each operator is set randomly at the beginning, and then are updated according to the success ratio of each operator, so more successful operators are used more often, and automatically chosen according to the instance of the problem, eliminating the difficult problem of hand tuning the probabilities.\nIn [TX97], the authors include a memory buffer for each individual to store good\npaths from its ancestors, which gave a small performance gain.\nIn [EAA04], the authors propose strategies for improving the stability and controlling population diversity for a simplified version of the EP/N.

Our EXTEND function, if the point cannot be added without collisions to a tree,\nadds the mid point between the nearest tree node and the nearest collision point to it.\n3.

Therefore we present results for both kinds of behavior: DRRT-adv and MP-RRT-adv move even when the trees are disconnected, while DRRT-noadv and MP-RRT-noadv only move when the trees are connected.\nIn MP-RRT, the forest was handled by simply replacing the oldest tree in it if the\nforest had reached the maximum allowed size.\nConcerning the parameter selection, the probability for selecting a point in the vicinity of a point in the waypoint cache in DRRT was set to 0.4 as suggested in [FKS06]. The probability for trying to reuse a subtree in MP-RRT was set to 0.1 as suggested in [ZKB07].

For the simple multi-stage probabilistic algorithm, the restart is made after one second of encountering the same obstacle along the planned path.

An interesting fact is that in map 1 DRRT is slightly faster than MP-RRT, and in map 2 MP-RRT is faster than DRRT. However the differences are too small to draw any conclusions. Figures 4.6 and 4.7 show the times and success rates of the different algorithms, when changing the number of dynamic obstacles in map 1. The simple multi-stage algorithm and the mixed RRT-EP/N clearly show the best performance, while the DRRT-adv and MP-RRT-adv significantly reduce their success rate when confronted to more than 30 moving obstacles."}, {"heading": "4.3.2 Partially Known Environment Results", "text": "Taking both maps into consideration, the results in tables 4.3 and 4.4 show that both combined algorithms are faster and more consistent than the RRT variants, with the simple multi-stage algorithm being faster in both. These results were unexpected, as the combined algorithms were designed for dynamic environments. It is worth to notice though, that in map 1 DRRT-adv is a close second, but in map 2 it is a close last, so its lack of reliability does not make it a good choice in this scenario. In this environment, as in the dynamic environment, in map 1 DRRT is faster than MP-RRT, while the opposite happens in map 2."}, {"heading": "4.3.3 Unknown Environment Results", "text": "Results in table 4.5 present the combined RRT-EP/N clearly as the faster algorithm in unknown environments, with the multi-stage algorithm in second place. In contrast to\n34\ndynamic and partially known environments in this same map, MP-RRT is faster than DRRT.\n35\nChapter 5"}, {"heading": "Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "The new multi-stage algorithm proposed here has good performance in very dynamic environments. It behaves particularly well when several small obstacles are moving around at random. This is explained by the fact that if the obstacles are constantly moving, they will sometimes move out of the way by themselves, which our algorithm takes advantage of, while RRT based ones do not, they just drop branches of the tree that could prove useful again just a few moments later. The combined RRT-EP/N, although having more operators, and automatic adjustment of the operator probabilities according to their effectiveness, is still better than the RRT variants, but about 55% slower than the simple multi-stage algorithm. This is explained by the number of collision checks performed, more than twice than the multi-stage algorithm, because collision checks must be performed for the entire population, not just a single path.\nIn the partially known environment, even though the difference in collision checks is even greater than in dynamic environments, the RRT-EP/N performance is about 25% worse than the multi-stage algorithm. Overall, the RRT variants are closer to the performance of both combined algorithms.\nIn the totally unknown environment, the combined RRT-EP/N is about 30% faster than the simple multi-stage algorithm, and both outperform the RRT variants, with much smaller times and standard deviations.\nAll things considered, the simple multi-stage algorithm is the best choice in most situations, with faster and more predictable planning times, a higher success rate, fewer collision checks performed and, above all, a much simpler implementation than all the\n37\nother algorithms compared.\nThis thesis shows that a multi-stage approach, using different techniques for initial plannning and navigation, outperforms current probabilistic sampling techniques in dynamic, partially known and unknown environments.\nPart of the results presented in this thesis are published in [BALS09]."}, {"heading": "5.1 Future Work", "text": "We propose several areas of improvement for the work presented in this thesis."}, {"heading": "5.1.1 Algorithms", "text": "The most promising area of improvement seems to be to experiment with different on-line planners such as a version of the EvP ([AR05] and [AR08]) modified to work in continuous configuration space or a potential field navigator. Also, the local search presented here could benefit from the use of more sophisticated operators and the parameters for the RRT variants (such as forest size for MP-RRT), and the EP/N (such as population size) could benefit from being tuned specifically for this implementation, and not simply reusing the parameters found in previous work.\nAnother area of research that could be tackled is extending this algorithm to higher\ndimensional problems, as RRT variants are known to work well in higher dimensions.\nFinally, as RRT variants are suitable for kinodynamic planning, we only need to adapt the on-line stage of the algorithm to have a new multi-stage planner for problems with kinodynamic constraints."}, {"heading": "5.1.2 Framework", "text": "The MoPa framework could benefit from the integration of a third party logic layer, with support for arbitrary geometrical shapes, a spatial scene graph and hierarchical maps. Some candidates would be OgreODE [Ogr], Spring RTS [Spr] and ORTS [ORT].\nOther possible improvements are adding support for other map formats, including discrimination of static and moving obstacles, limited sensor range simulation and\n38\nintegration with external hardware such as the Lego NXT [Leg], to run experiments in a more realistic scenario.\n39"}], "references": [{"title": "Efficient nearest neighbor searching for motion planning", "author": ["A.

The problem is finding and traversing a collision-free path for a holonomic robot, without kinodynamic restrictions, moving in an environment with several unpredictably moving obstacles or adversaries. The availability of perfect information of the environment at all times is assumed. Several static and dynamic variants of the Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm are explored, as well as an evolutionary algorithm for planning in dynamic environments called the Evolutionary Planner/Navigator. A combination of both kinds of algorithms is proposed to overcome shortcomings in both, and then a combination of a RRT variant for initial planning and informed local search for navigation, plus a simple greedy heuristic for optimization. We show that this combination of simple techniques provides better responses to highly dynamic environments than the RRT extensions.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
