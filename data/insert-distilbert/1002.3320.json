In addition to the diversity improvement on flat fading channels, it can achieve a coding gain with no bandwidth sacrifice. Combining multiple receive antennas, space-time coding can minimize the effects of multipath fading and achieve high channel capacities in the MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems [3]. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in providing high data rate services such as video conferencing, multimedia internet access and wide area networks over wideband wireless channels. Consequently, the transmitted signals experience frequency-selective fading. Thus, the channel induces intersymbol interference (ISI) which makes code performance degrade. Without equalization, a promising approach to mitigate ISI is OFDM technique [4] which is used in various standards of wireless communication systems. The high rate data stream is demultiplexed into a large number of subchannels. The number must be chosen to ensure that each subchannel has a bandwidth less than the coherence bandwidth of the channel, so the subchannel is characterized as flat fading. Each subchannel however has a high error probability in deep fades.\nThe combination of space-time coding and the OFDM modulation [5] is not only alleviate drawbacks of each other, but also improve the high speed transmission performance limited to two fundamental impairments, multipath fading and ISI. However, using multiple transmit\nantennas at each mobile causes mutual interference at the receiver by either signals transmitted from different antennas of the same transmitter or other transmitters. Additional processing is required to mitigate co-channel interferences (CCI) in space-time coded OFDM (STC-OFDM) systems.\nTo maximize the STC-OFDM system efficiency, the problem of CCI introduced by the space-time coding must be solved. Adaptive antenna arrays are an attractive solution because they can suppress CCI and mitigate the effects of multipath fading [6], [7], [8], [9]. Regarding to beamforming techniques for STC-OFDM systems, some research attempts have been mainly focused on the transmit beamforming in downlink since the fact that download intensive services and wireless web browsing are to be introduced in the next generation [10], [11], [12], [13]. Study on receive beamforming which is widely applied to uplink of cellular mobile systems has also attracted attention to both suppress CCI and minimize fading effects. This latter is the case that we consider in this paper. In [14], it is shown that the scheme of MIMO wireless systems incorporating a beamforming method before space-time decoder can effectively mitigate CCI while preserving the space-time structure. The beamforming method called the minimum variance distortion response (MVDR) beamformer is used as a CCI canceller in OFDM systems using space-time trellis codes in reverse link. One disadvantage of the MVDR beamformer is based on accurate estimation of the desired DOAs and degrade obviously when there are errors in desired DOAs.

A minimum mean squared error (MMSE) beamforming is applied to the space-time block coding combined with the OFDM system [16]. The method relies on the number of training blocks corresponding to the chosen cluster sizes. Spacefrequency OFDM system with the null steering beamforming for CCI suppression is investigated in [17]. In this paper, an adaptive beamforming algorithm based on minimum means square error of pilot signals is presented which does not require known desired DOAs as the MVDR beamforming and the null steering beamforming. The resulting coefficients are inversed in order to deepen nulls such that it can increase CCI suppression ability in the space-time trellis coded OFDM systems.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the conventional STC-OFDM system model is given. Section 3 describes the proposed adaptive beamforming and null deepening as a CCI canceller in the STC-OFDM system. It also includes a conventional beamforming algorithm called the null steering beamforming. The space-time decoders are expressed in section 4. The simulation results are presented in section 5.

We use a 16-state space-time trellis coded QPSK scheme. The encoder takes 512 bits as its input at each time to generate two coded QPSK sequences of length 256 symbols which are multiplexed to 32 pilot symbols. The transmitted signals experience the frequency selective, two-ray Rayleigh fading channel with a delay of \u03c4 =\n15 s\u00b5 . Both two paths of a transmitted signal have equal\naverage power. In fading channel with a maximum Doppler frequency of 50 Hz, the power spectral density satisfies Jakes model [21]. The total available bandwidth is 1 MHz with 288 subcarriers. This corresponds to a subchannel separation of 3.5 KHz and the duration of an OFDM frame is 288 s\u00b5 . To avoid ISI, a CP of 40 s\u00b5 duration is ap-\npended to each OFDM frame. In the following simulation, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is defined as the average energy per symbol divided by the one sided noise power\nspectral density 0N , and the signal to interference ratio (SIR) is the ratio between average energy per symbol of the desired transmitter and CCI.\nFigs. 4 and 5 illustrate the beam responses generated by the proposed adaptive beamforming and null deepening in comparison to the null steering beamforming algorithm.

It can be seen that we can achieve deeper nulls by using the proposed null synthesis. This reduces interference signals significantly. Note that the proposed beamformer does not require the prior knowledge of the DOAs as the null steering beamformer does.\nIn Fig. 6, we present the performance of the conventional STC-OFDM system without CCI cancellers with different SIR values. As SIR increases, the performance improves according to the decreased frame error rates (FER). This implies that CCI degrades the performance of the STC-OFDM system.\nIn addition to the presence of CCI signals, duration of delay spread also affects the performance degradation of the conventional STC-OFDM scheme as illustrated in Fig. 7. Due to the fact that multipath channels with a large delay spread give rise to a short coherence bandwidth, this yields a much higher frequency diversity gain for the STTC than that of short delay spread. The time delay has no impact when applying the proposed beamformer as a CCI canceller.\nFig. 8 indicates that performance of proposed system is not affected by a time delay because the guard interval is larger than the time delay. Therefore, the beamformers serve as a CCI canceller as well as a time diversity technique.\nWe compare the performance of the STC-OFDM system using the adaptive beamforming and null deepening for the different number of interferers as plotted in Fig. 9. The DOAs of the two paths of the desired mobile are (10, -20) and the DOAs of the two paths of one interferer are given at (-60, 40). For two interferes, we use (20, -60) for the angles of the two paths of the desired mobile whereas (50, -20, 80, 0) represents the DOAs of the two paths of two interferes. Let (20, -60, 50, -20, 80, 0, 35, -45) be the third DOA set where first two angles are the DOAs of the desired mobile and the last six angles are the DOAs of the three interferes. As seen in Fig. 9, it performs worse as the number of interferes increases.\nFig. 10 plots FERs to compare the performances of the STC-OFDM scheme between using the proposed beamformer (solid lines) and the null steering beamformer (dash lines). Three different impinging directions of the two paths of the desired signals are considered. The performance of the STC-OFDM scheme using the null steering beamformer is affected by the impinging angles. For the STC-OFDM scheme using the null steering beamformer, the FERs (dash line) increase if DOAs is closer. The null steering beamforming gives unsharp beam patterns due to the noise gain induced when two impinging angles of the desired signals become close to each other.\nWe conclude the ability to suppress CCI of the proposed beamformer by presenting Fig. 11. The performance of the conventional STC-OFDM scheme is used as an upper bound to show the system improvement using the proposed beamformer.

Due to time diversity of multipath propagation, the proposed beamformer can significantly suppress CCI for each path and preserve the structure of space-time decoding. The null steering beamformer which requires a prior knowledge of DOAs is used to compare the performance of the proposed CCI canceller. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm outperforms the null steering beamformer to increase the system ability for CCI cancellation."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "This work was supported in part by the Thailand Research Fund (TRF) under Grant MRG5080005."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2010, "abstractText": "Combined with space-time coding, the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system explores space<lb>diversity.
