Recently, there have been extensive interests in combining ASP with other computational and reasoning paradigms. One of the main interests in this direction is the integration of ASP with ontology reasoning, for the Semantic Web.\nThe Semantic Web is an evolving development of the World Wide Web in which the meaning of information and services on the web are defined, so that the web content can be precisely understood and used by agents (Berners-Lee et al. 2001). For this purpose, a layered structure including the Rules Layer built on top of the Ontology Layer has been recognized as a fundamental framework. Description Logics (DLs) (Baader et al. 2007) provide a formal basis for the Web Ontology Language which is the standard of the Ontology Layer (W3C OWL Working Group 2009).\n\u2217 This is the full version of (Wang et al. 2010).\nar X\niv :1\n00 7.\n40 40\nv1 [\ncs .A\nI] 2"}, {"heading": "2 Y. Wang et al.", "text": "Adding nonmonotonic rules to the Rules Layer would allow default reasoning with ontologies. For example, we know that most natural kinds do not have a clear cut definition. For instance, a precise definition of scientist seems to be difficult by enumerating what a scientist is, and does. Though we can say that a scientist possesses expert knowledge on the subject of his or her investigation, we still need a definition of expert knowledge, which cannot be defined quantitatively. Using nonmonotonic rules, we can perform default, typicality reasoning over categories, concepts, and roles. The integration of DLs and (nonmonotonic) rules has been extensively investigated as a crucial problem in the study of the Semantic Web, such as Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) (Horrocks and PatelSchneider 2004), MKNF knowledge base (Motik and Rosati 2010), and Description Logic Programs (dl-programs) (Eiter et al. 2008).\nThere are different approaches to the integration of ASP with description logics. The focus of this paper is on the approach based on dl-programs. Informally, a dl-program is a pair (O ,P), where O is a DL knowledge base and P is a logic program whose rule bodies may contain queries, embedded in dl-atoms, to the knowledge base O . The answer to such a query depends on inferences by rules over the DL knowledge base O . In this way, rules are built on top of ontologies. On the other hand, ontology reasoning is also enhanced, since it depends not only on O but also on inferences using (nonmonotonic) rules. Two semantics for dl-programs have been proposed, one of which is based on strong answer sets and the other based on weak answer sets.\nIn this paper, we generalize the notions of completion and loop formulas of logic programs (Lin and Zhao 2004) to dl-programs and show that weak and strong answer sets of a dl-program can be captured precisely by the models of its completion and the corresponding loop formulas. This provides not only a semantic characterization of answer sets for dl-programs but also an alternative mechanism for answer set computation, using a dl-reasoner and a SAT solver.\nAs commented by (Eiter et al. 2008), the reason to introduce strong answer sets is because some weak answer sets seem counterintuitive due to \u201cself-supporting\u201d loops. Recently however, one of the co-authors of this paper, Yi-Dong Shen, discovered that strong answer sets may also possess self-supporting loops, and a detailed analysis leads to the conclusion that the problem cannot be easily fixed by an alternative definition of reduct, since the reduct of dl-atoms may not be able to capture dynamically generated self-supports arising from the integrated context.\nThe solution proposed in this paper is to use loop formulas as a way to define answer sets for dl-programs that are free of self-supports. Thus, we define what are called canonical loops and canonical loop formulas. Given a dl-program, the models of its completion satisfying the canonical loop formulas constitute a new class of answer sets, called canonical answer sets, that are minimal and noncircular.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we recall the basic definitions of description logics and dl-programs. In Section 3, we define completion, weak and strong loop formulas for dl-programs. The new semantics of dl-programs based on canonical loop formulas is given in Section 4. Section 5 discusses related work, and finally Section 6 gives concluding remarks.\nLoop Formulas for Description Logic Programs1 3"}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In this section, we briefly review the basic notations for description logics and description logic programs (Eiter et al. 2008)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Description logics", "text": "In principle, the description logics employed in description logic programs can be arbitrary, with the restriction that the underlying entailment relation is decidable. Due to space limitation, we introduce the basic description logic ALC (Baader et al. 2007), instead of the description logics SHIF and SHOIN described in (Eiter et al. 2008). The notations introduced here will be used throughout the paper, particularly the entailment relation O |= F , given at the end of this subsection.\nFor the languageALC, we assume a vocabulary \u03a8 = (A \u222aR, I), where A,R and I are pairwise disjoint (denumerable) sets of atomic concepts, roles (including equality \u2248 and inequality 6\u2248), and individuals respectively. The concepts of ALC are defined as follows:\nC ,D \u2212\u2192 A|>|\u22a5|\u00acC |C uD |C tD |\u2200R \u00b7 C |\u2203R \u00b7 C\nwhere A is an atomic concept and R is a role. The assertions of ALC are of the forms C (a) or R(b, c), where C is a concept, R is a role, and a, b, c are individuals. An inclusion axiom ofALC has the form C v D where C and D are concepts. A description knowledge base (or ontology) of ALC is a set of inclusion axioms and assertions of ALC.\nThe semantics of ALC is defined by translating to first-order logic and then using classical first-order interpretations as its semantics. Informally, let the transformation be \u03c4 : (1) \u03c4(A) = A(x ), \u03c4(R) = R(x , y) where A is an atomic concept and R a role; (2) \u03c4(\u2200R\u00b7C ) = \u2200x \u00b7R(y , x ) \u2283 \u03c4(C )(x ), and \u03c4(\u2203R\u00b7C ) = \u2203x \u00b7R(y , x )\u2227\u03c4(C )(x ); (3) \u03c4(\u00acC ) = \u00ac\u03c4(C )(x ), \u03c4(C uD) = \u03c4(C )(x ) \u2227 \u03c4(D)(x ), and \u03c4(C tD) = \u03c4(C )(x ) \u2228 \u03c4(D)(x ); (4) \u03c4(A(a)) = A(a), \u03c4(R(b, c)) = R(b, c); (5) \u03c4(C v D) = \u2200x \u00b7 \u03c4(C )(x ) \u2283 \u03c4(D)(x ). Then, the semantics ofALC follows from that of first-order logic, so is the entailment relation O |= F , for a description knowledge base O and an assertion or inclusive axiom F ."}, {"heading": "2.2 Description logic programs", "text": "Let \u03a6 = (P, C) be a first-order vocabulary with nonempty finite sets C and P of constant symbols and predicate symbols respectively such that P is disjoint from A \u222aR and C \u2286 I.

S p) extends S (resp. \u00acS ) by the extension of p, and S p constrains S to p.\nFor example, suppose the interface is such that if any individual x is registered for a course (the information from outside an ontology) then x is a student (x may not be a student by the ontology before this communication), and we query if a is a student. We can then write the dl-atom DL[Student \u2295 registered ;Student ](a). Similarly, DL[Student registered ;\u00acStudent u \u00acEmployed ](a) queries if a is not a student nor employed, with the ontology enhancement that if we cannot show x is registered, then x is not a student.\nA dl-rule (or simply a rule) is an expression of the form\nA\u2190 B1, . . . ,Bm ,not Bm+1, . . . ,not Bn , (n \u2265 m \u2265 0) (2)\nwhere A is an atom, each Bi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) is an atom2 or a dl-atom. We refer to A as its head, while the conjunction of Bi(1 \u2264 i \u2264 m) and not Bj (m + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n) is its body.

A description logic program (dl-program) K = (O ,P) consists of a DL knowledge base O and a finite set P of dl-rules. In what follows we assume the vocabulary of P is implicitly given by the constant symbols and predicates symbols occurring in P , unless stated otherwise.\nGiven a dl-program K = (O ,P), the Herbrand base of P , denoted by HBP , is the set of atoms formed from the predicate symbols in P occurring in P and the constant symbols in C occurring in P . An interpretation I (relative to P ) is a subset of HBP . Such an I is a model of an atom or dl-atom A under O , written I |=O A, if the following holds:\n\u2022 if A \u2208 HBP , then I |=O A iff A \u2208 I ; \u2022 if A is a dl-atom DL(\u03bb;Q)(~t) of the form (1), then I |=O A iff O(I ;\u03bb) |= Q(~t)\nwhere O(I ;\u03bb) = O \u222a \u22c3m\ni=1 Ai(I ) and, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m ,\nAi(I ) =  {Si(~e)|pi(~e) \u2208 I }, if opi = \u2295; {\u00acSi(~e)|pi(~e) \u2208 I }, if opi = ; {\u00acSi(~e)|pi(~e) /\u2208 I }, if opi = ;\nwhere ~e is a tuple of constants over C. The interpretation I is a model of a dl-rule of the form (3) iff I |=O B for any B \u2208 Pos and I 6|=O B \u2032 for any B \u2032 \u2208 Neg implies I |=O A. I is a model of a dl-programK = (O ,P), written I |=O K, iff I is a model of each rule of P . I is a supported model ofK = (O ,P) iff, for any h \u2208 I , there is a rule (h \u2190 Pos,not Neg) in P such that I |=O A for any A \u2208 Pos and I 6|=O B for any B \u2208 Neg.\nA dl-atom A is monotonic relative to a dl-program K = (O ,P) if I |=O A implies I \u2032 |=O A, for all I \u2286 I \u2032 \u2286 HBP , otherwise A is nonmonotonic. It is clear that if a dl-atom does not mention then it is monotonic. However, a dl-atom may be monotonic even if it mentions . E.g., the dl-atom DL[S p,S p;\u00acS ](a) is monotonic (which is a tautology). Clearly, the operator is the only one that may cause a dl-atom to be nonmonotonic. Thus\n2 Different from that of (Eiter et al. 2008), we consider ground atoms instead of literals for convenience.\nLoop Formulas for Description Logic Programs3 5\none has no reason to use in monotonic dl-atoms. It is a reasonable assumption that we can rewrite a monotonic dl-atom into an equivalent one without using at all.\nWe use DLP to denote the set of all dl-atoms that occur in P , DL+P \u2286 DLP to denote the set of monotonic dl-atoms, and DL?P = DLP \\ DL + P . A dl-program K = (O ,P) is positive if (i) P is \u201cnot\u201d-free, and (ii) every dl-atom is monotonic relative toK.

For this dl-program to make some sense, let\u2019s image this situation: c\u2032 and c are classes of good conference papers and ICLP papers respectively, p(x ) means that x is a paper in the TPLP special issue of ICLP 2010, w(x ) means that x is worth reading, and a stands for \u201cthis paper\u201d. Note that c and c\u2032 are concepts in O , and p and w are predicates outside of O . The communication is through the dl-rule, w(a) \u2190 DL[c \u2295 p; c\u2032](a), which says that if \u201cthis paper\u201d is a good conference paper, given that any paper in the TPLP special issue of ICLP 2010 is an ICLP paper and ICLP papers are good conference papers (by the knowledge in O), then it is worth reading. K0 has exactly one strong answer set {p(a),w(a)}, which is also its unique weak answer set. \u2022 Now, suppose someone writes K1 = (O ,P1) where O = {c v c\u2032} and P1 = {p(a) \u2190 DL[c \u2295 p; c\u2032](a)}. This program has a unique strong answer set I1 = \u2205 and two weak answer sets I1 and I2 = {p(a)}. It can be seen that there is a circular justification in the weak answer set I2: that \u201cthis paper\u201d is in the TPLP special issue of ICLP 2010 is justified by its being in it. The interested reader may verify the following. By the definition of \u2295, O(I2; c \u2295"}, {"heading": "6 Y. Wang et al.", "text": "p) = O \u222a{c(a)}, and clearly O 6|= c\u2032(a) and {c(a), c v c\u2032} |= c\u2032(a). So the weak dl-transform relative to O and I2 is Kw ,I21 = (O , {p(a) \u2190}). Since I2 coincides with the least model of {p(a)\u2190}, it is a weak answer set of K1. Similarly, one can verify that the strong dl-transform relative to O and I2 is Ks,I21 = (O ,P1). Its least model is the empty set, so I2 is not a strong answer set of K1. \u2022 K2 = (O ,P2) where O = \u2205 and P2 = {p(a) \u2190 DL[c \u2295 p, b q ; c u \u00acb](a)}. Both \u2205 and {p(a)} are strong and weak answer sets of the dl-program. \u2022 K3 = (\u2205,P3) where P3 = {p(a)\u2190 DL[c p, b q ;\u00acc u \u00acb](a)}. \u2205 and {p(a)} are both strong and weak answer sets of the dl-program. \u2022 K4 = (\u2205,P4) where P4 = {p(a) \u2190 DL[c p;\u00acc](a)}. K4 has no weak answer set, and thus it has no strong answer set either.\nThese dl-programs show that strong (and weak) answer sets may not be (set inclusion) minimal. It has been shown that if a dl-program contains no nonmonotonic dl-atoms then its strong answer sets are minimal (Eiter et al. 2008). However, this does not hold for weak answer sets as shown by the dl-program K1 above, even if it is positive. It is known that strong answer sets are always weak answer sets, but not vice versa (Eiter et al. 2008)."}, {"heading": "3 Completion and Loop Formulas", "text": "In this section, we define completion, characterize weak and strong answer sets by loop formulas, and outline an alternative method of computing weak and strong answer sets."}, {"heading": "3.1 Completion", "text": "Given a dl-program K = (O ,P), we assume an underlying propositional language LK, such that the propositional atoms of LK include the atoms and dl-atoms occurring in P .

The strong loop formula of L (relative to K), written sLF(L,K), is the following formula of LK:\u2228\nL \u2283 \u2228\n1\u2264i\u2264n  \u2227 A\u2208Posi \u03b3(A,L) \u2227 \u2227 B\u2208Neg i \u00acB  where\n\u2022 (h1 \u2190 Pos1,not Neg1), . . . , (hn \u2190 Posn ,not Negn) are all the rules in P such that hi \u2208 L and Posi \u2229 L = \u2205 for all i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n), \u2022 \u03b3(A,L) = IF(A,L) if A is a monotonic dl-atom, and A otherwise.\nIn general, we have to recognize the monotonicity of dl-atoms in order to construct strong loops of dl-programs. In this sense, the strong loops and strong loop formulas are defined semantically. If a dl-atom does not mention the operator then it is obviously monotonic. Thus for the class of dl-programs in which no monotonic dl-atoms mention , the strong loops and strong loop formulas are given syntactically, since it is sufficient to determine the monotonicity of a dl-atom by checking whether it contains the operator .\nExample 2 Let K = (\u2205,P) be a dl-program where P consists of\np(a)\u2190 DL[c \u2295 p; c](a); p(a)\u2190 not DL[c \u2295 p; c](a)\u00b7\nThe dl-program K has a unique strong loop L = {p(a)}, but doesn\u2019t have any weak loops. Its completion is the formula:\np(a)\u2194 DL[c \u2295 p; c](a) \u2228 \u00acDL[c \u2295 p; c](a)\nLoop Formulas for Description Logic Programs6 9\nwhich equals to the formula p(a) \u2194 >, i.e., p(a). Note that, the strong loop formula sLF(L,K) is the formula:\np(a) \u2283 [\nDL[c \u2295 pL; c](a) \u2227 (pL(a)\u2194 p(a) \u2227 a 6= a) \u2228\u00acDL[c \u2295 p; c](a)\n] \u00b7\nIt is clear that the interpretation I = {p(a)} is a model of COMP(K) relative to the DL knowledge base O = \u2205. However, I 6|=O sLF(L,K).\nTheorem 2 Let K = (O ,P) be a dl-program and I an interpretation of P . Then I is a strong answer set of K if and only if I \u2032 |=O COMP(K) \u222a sLF(K), where sLF(K) is the set of strong loop formulas of all strong loops of K and I \u2032 is the extension of I satisfying (4).\nSince a weak loop of a dl-program K is also a strong loop of K, as a by-product, our loop formula characterizations yield an alternative proof that strong answer sets are also weak answer sets.\nProposition 3 Let K = (O ,P) be a dl-program, I an interpretation of P and L a weak loop of K. Then we have I \u2032 |=O sLF(L,K) \u2283 wLF(L,K), where I \u2032 is the extension of I satisfying (4)."}, {"heading": "3.4 An alternative method of computing weak and strong answer sets", "text": "Theorems 1 and 2 serve as the basis for an alternative method of computing weak and strong answer sets using a SAT solver, along with a dl-reasoner R with the following property:R is sound, complete, and terminating for entailment checking.

Let \u03beA be the new atom in T \u2032, for the dl-atom A in T , and X be the set of all such new atoms in T \u2032.

(Eiter et al. 2008), some weak answer sets may be considered counterintuitive because of \u201cself-supporting\u201d loops. For instance, consider the weak answer set {p(a)} of the dl-programK1 in Example 1. The evidence of the truth of p(a) is inferred by means of a self-supporting loop: \u201cp(a) \u21d0 DL[c \u2295 p; c\u2032](a) \u21d0 p(a)\u201d, which involves not only the dl-atom DL[c \u2295 p; c\u2032](a) but the DL knowledge base O . Thus the truth of p(a) depends on the truth of itself. This self-support is excluded by the strong loop formula of the loop L = {p(a)}.\nLet\u2019s consider the dl-program K2 in Example 1 again. Note that {p(a)} is a strong answer set of K2. The truth of the atom p(a) depends on the truth of [c u \u00acb](a) which depends on the truth of p(a) and \u00acq(a). Thus the truth of p(a) depends on the truth of itself. The self-supporting loop is: \u201cp(a)\u21d0 DL[c\u2295p, b q ; cu\u00acb](a)\u21d0 (p(a)\u2227\u00acq(a))\u201d. In this sense, some strong answer sets may be considered counterintuitive as well.\nThe notion of \u201ccircular justification\u201d was formally defined by (Liu and You 2008) to characterize self-supports for lparse programs, which was motivated by the notion of unfoundedness for logic programs (Van Gelder et al. 1991) and logic programs with aggregates (Calimeri et al. 2005). With slight modifications, we extend the concept of circular justification to dl-programs. Formally, let K = (O ,P) be a dl-program and I \u2286 HBP be a supported model of K. I is said to be circularly justified (or simply circular) if there is a nonempty subset M of I such that\nI \\M 6|=O \u2227\nA\u2208Pos A \u2227 \u2227 B\u2208Neg \u00acB (5)\nfor any dl-rule (h \u2190 Pos,not Neg) in P with h \u2208 M and I |=O \u2227 A\u2208Pos A\u2227 \u2227\nB\u2208Neg \u00acB . Otherwise, we say that I is noncircular. Intuitively speaking, Condition (5) means that the atoms in M have no support from outside of M , i.e., they have to depend on themselves.\nExample 3 Let K = (\u2205,P) where P consists of\np(a)\u2190 not DL[b p;\u00acb](a)\u00b7\nIt is not difficult to verify that K has two weak answer sets \u2205 and {p(a)}. They are strong answer sets of K as well. In terms of the above definition, {p(a)} is circular.\nIt is interesting to note that weak answer sets allow self-supporting loops involving any dl-atoms (either monotonic or nonmonotonic), while strong answer sets allow selfsupporting loops only involving nonmonotonic dl-atoms and their default negations. These considerations motivate us to define a new semantics which is free of circular justifications.\nLoop Formulas for Description Logic Programs7 11"}, {"heading": "4.2 Canonical answer sets by loop formulas", "text": "Let K = (O ,P) be a dl-program. The canonical dependency graph of K, written GcK, is the directed graph (V ,E ), where V = HBP and (u, v) \u2208 E if there is a rule of the form (2) in P such that A = u and there exists an interpretation I \u2286 HBP such that either of the following two conditions holds:\n(1) I 6|=O Bi and I \u222a{v} |=O Bi , for some i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 m). In this case, we say that v is a positive monotonic (resp., nonmonotonic) dependency of Bi if Bi is a monotonic (resp., nonmonotonic) dl-atom. Intuitively, the truth of Bi may depend on that of v while the truth of u may depend on that of Bi . Thus the truth of u may depend on that of v . (2) I |=O Bj and I \u222a {v} 6|=O Bj , for some j (1 + m \u2264 j \u2264 n). Clearly, Bj must be nonmonotonic. In this case, we say that v is a negative nonmonotonic dependency of Bj . Intuitively, the truth of u may depend on that of \u201cnot Bj \u201d, while its truth may depend on that of v . Thus the truth of u may depend on that of v .\nA nonempty subset L of HBP is a canonical loop of K if there is a cycle in GcK that goes through only and all the nodes in L. It is clear that if Bi = v then the interpretation I = {v} satisfies v while I \\ {v} does not. Thus the notion of canonical loops is a generalization of that of weak loops given in Subsection 3.2, and a generalization of the notion of loops for normal logic programs (Lin and Zhao 2004).\nNote further that the canonical dependency graph is not a generalization of the strong positive dependency graph, since some strong loops are not canonical loops. E.g., with the dl-program K = (\u2205,P), where P = {p(a) \u2190 DL[c p, c p,\u00acc](a)}, the dlatom A = DL[c p, c p,\u00acc](a) is equivalent to >. So it is monotonic. It follows that L = {p(a)} is a strong loop of K. However L is not a canonical loop of K because there is no interpretation I such that I 6|=O A and I \u222a {p(a)} |=O A.\nDue to the two kinds of dependencies in a canonical dependency graph defined above, to define canonical loop formulas, we need two kinds of irrelevant formulas: Let L be a set of atoms and A = DL[\u03bb;Q ](~t) a nonmonotonic dl-atom. The positive canonical irrelevant formula of A with respect to L, written pCF(A,L), is the conjunction of (1) DL[\u03bbL;Q ](~t), where \u03bbL is obtained from \u03bb by replacing each predicate p with pL if L contains an atom p(~c) which is a positive nonmonotonic dependency of A and, (2) for each predicate p occurring in \u03bb, the instantiation on C of the formula (4) if L contains an atom p(~c) which is a positive nonmonotonic dependency of A. The negative canonical irrelevant formula of A with respect to L, written nCF(A,L), is the conjunction of (1) DL[\u03bbL;Q ](~t), where \u03bbL is obtained from \u03bb by replacing each predicate p with pL if L contains an atom p(~c) which is a negative nonmonotonic dependency of A and, (2) for each predicate p occurring in \u03bb, the instantiation on C of the formula (4) if L contains an atom p(~c) which is a negative nonmonotonic dependency of A.\nLet K = (O ,P) be a dl-program, M \u2286 HBP and L a loop of K. The canonical loop formula of L relative to K under M , written cLF(L,M ,K), is the following formula:\n\u2228 L \u2283 \u2228 1\u2264i\u2264n  \u2227 A\u2208Posi \u03b41(A,L) \u2227 \u2227 B\u2208Neg i \u00ac\u03b42(B ,L) \nwhere\n\u2022 (h1 \u2190 Pos1,not Neg1), . . . , (hn \u2190 Posn ,not Negn) are all the rules in P such that hi \u2208 L, Posi\u2229L = \u2205 and M |=O \u2227 A\u2208Posi A\u2227 \u2227 B\u2208Neg i \u00acB for each i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n), \u2022 \u03b41(A,L) = pCF(A,L) if A is a nonmonotonic dl-atom, \u03b3(A,L) otherwise, \u2022 \u03b42(B ,L) = nCF(B ,L) if B is a nonmonotonic dl-atom, and B otherwise.\nGiven a dl-program K = (O ,P) and an interpretation I \u2286 HBP . We call I a canonical answer set of K if I \u2032 is a model of COMP(K) \u222a cLF(I ,K) relative to O , where I \u2032 is the extension of I satisfying (4) and cLF(I ,K) = {cLF(L, I ,K)|L is a canonical loop of K}. It is not difficult to prove that every canonical answer set of a dl-program K is a supported model of K.\nExample 4 Consider the dl-program K2 in Example 1, i.e., K2 = (\u2205,P2) where P2 = {p(a) \u2190 DL[c\u2295p, b q ; cu\u00acb](a)}. It is easy to see that the dl-atom DL[c\u2295p, b q ; cu\u00acb](a) is nonmonotonic, \u2205 6|=O DL[c \u2295 p, b q ; c u \u00acb](a), and {p(a)} |=O DL[c \u2295 p, b q ; c u\u00acb](a). Thus L = {p(a)} is a canonical loop of K2. Let I = {p(a)}. The canonical loop formula cLF(L, I ,K) is equivalent to\np(a) \u2283 DL[c \u2295 pL, b q ; c u \u00acb](a) \u2227 (pL(a)\u2194 p(a) \u2227 (a 6= a))\nwhere the last conjunct is equivalent to \u00acpL(a). Thus, the loop formula is not satisfied by the extension of I satisfying (4) relative to the knowledge base \u2205. So I is not a canonical answer set of K2, even if I is a model of COMP(K2) relative to the knowledge base \u2205.\nThe next example demonstrates the difference among the positive dependency graphs of dl-programs.\nExample 5 Let K = (O ,P) be a dl-program where O = \u2205 and P consists of the following rules:\np(a1)\u2190 DL[c \u2295 p, c](a1), p(a3)\u2190 not DL[c p,\u00acc](a3), p(a2)\u2190 DL[c \u2295 p, b q ; c u \u00acb](a2), p(a4)\u2190 p(a4).\nThe only weak positive dependency on HBP is (p(a4), p(a4)), the strong positive dependency includes (p(a1), p(a1)) besides the weak one, while the canonical positive dependency contains (p(a2), p(a2)) and (p(a3), p(a3)) in addition to the strong ones. Figure 1 depicts the various dependency relations on HBP . The weak positive dependency graph is GwK = (V ,E ) where V = {p(ai), q(ai)|1 \u2264 i \u2264 4} and E = {(p(a4), p(a4))}, while the strong one is GsK = (V ,E\n\u2032) where E \u2032 = E \u222a {(p(a1), p(a1))}. The canonical dependency graph is GcK = (V ,E \u2032\u2032) where E \u2032\u2032 = E \u2032 \u222a {(p(a2), p(a2)), (p(a3), p(a3))}.\nLoop Formulas for Description Logic Programs8 13\nComparing with the previous definitions of loop formulas, in addition to the irrelevant formulas of nonmonotonic dl-atoms, the definition of canonical loop formulas has a notable distinction: it is given under a set M of atoms whose purpose is to restrict that the support of any atom in L come from the rules whose bodies are satisfied by M (relative to a knowledge base). The next proposition shows that the canonical loops and canonical loop formulas for dl-programs are indeed a generalization of loops and loop formulas for normal logic programs (Lin and Zhao 2004) respectively.\nProposition 4 Let P be a normal logic program, L \u2286 HBP and M a model of the completion of P .\n(1) L is a loop of P if and only if L is a canonical loop of K = (\u2205,P). (2) M |= LF (L,P) if and only if M |=O cLF(L,M ,P), where LF (L,P) is the loop\nformula associated with L under P (Lin and Zhao 2004) and O = \u2205.\nProposition 5 Let K = (O ,P) be a dl-program and I a canonical answer set of K. Then I is minimal in the sense that K has no canonical answer set I \u2032 such that I \u2032 \u2282 I .\nThe following two propositions show that the canonical answer sets of dl-programs are noncircular strong answer sets. Thus canonical answer sets are weak answer sets as well.\nProposition 6 Let K = (O ,P) be a dl-program and I \u2286 HBP a canonical answer set of K. Then I is noncircular.\nProposition 7 Let K = (O ,P) be a dl-program and I \u2286 HBP a canonical answer set of K. Then I is a strong answer set of K.\nThe following proposition, together with Proposition 6, implies that the operator is the only cause that a strong answer set of a dl-program is circular.\nProposition 8 Let K = (O ,P) be a dl-program in which P does not mention the operator . Then I \u2286 HBP is a canonical answer set of K if and only if I is a strong answer set of K."}, {"heading": "5 Related Work", "text": "Integrating ASP with description logics has attracted a great deal of attention recently. The existing approaches can be roughly classified into three categories. The first is to adopt a nonmonotonic formalism that covers both ASP and first-order logic (if not for the latter, then extend it to the first-order case) (Motik and Rosati 2010; Bruijn et al. 2007), where ontologies and rules are written in the same language, resulting in a tight coupling. The second is a loose approach: An ontology knowledge base and the rules share the same constants but not the same predicates, and the communication is via a well-defined interface, such as dl-atoms (Eiter et al. 2008). The third is to combine ontologies with hybrid rules (Rosati 2005; Rosati 2006; de Bruijn et al. 2007), where predicates in the language of ontologies are interpreted classically, whereas those in the language of rules are interpreted nonmonotonically."}, {"heading": "14 Y. Wang et al.", "text": "Although each approach above has its own merits, the loose approach possesses some unique advantages. In many situations, we would like to combine existing knowledge bases, possibly under different logics. In this case, a notion of interface is natural and necessary. The loose approach seems particularly intuitive, as it does not rely on the use of modal operators nor on a multi-valued logic. One notices that dl-programs share similar characteristics with another recent interest, multi-context systems, in which knowledge bases of arbitrary logics communicate through bridge rules (Brewka and Eiter 2007).\nHowever, the relationships among these different approaches are currently not well understood. For example, although we know how to translate a dl-program without the nonmonotonic operator to an MKNF theory while preserving the strong answer set semantics (Motik and Rosati 2010), when is involved, no such a translation is known. Similarly, although a variant of Quantified Equilibrium Logic (QEL) captures the existing hybrid approaches, as shown by (de Bruijn et al. 2007), it is not clear how one would apply the loop formulas for logic programs with arbitrary sentences (Lee and Meng 2008) to dl-programs, since, to the best of our knowledge, there is no syntactic, semantics-preserving translation from dl-programs to logic programs with arbitrary sentences or to QEL.\nIn fact, the loop formulas for dl-programs are more involved than any previously known loop formulas, due to mixing ASP with classical first-order logic. This is evidenced by the fact that weak loop formulas permit self-supports, strong loop formulas eliminate certain kind of self-supports, and finally canonical loop formulas remove all self-supports. This seems to be a unique phenomenon that arises to dl-programs, not to any other known extensions of ASP, including logic programs with arbitrary sentences."}, {"heading": "6 Concluding Remarks", "text": "In this paper, we characterized the weak and strong answer sets of dl-programs by program completion and loop formulas. Although these loop formulas also provide an alternative mechanism for computing answer sets, building such a system presents itself as an interesting future work. We also proposed the canonical answer sets for dl-programs, which are minimal and noncircular in a formal sense. From the perspective of loop formulas, we see a notable distinction among the weak, strong and canonical answer sets: the canonical answer sets permit no circular justifications, the strong answer sets permit circular justifications involving nonmonotonic dl-atoms but not monotonic ones, whereas the weak answer sets permit circular justifications that involve any dl-atoms but not atoms.\nWe remark that, for a given dl-program K = (O ,P), to decide if a set M \u2286 HBP is a strong or canonical loop and to construct the strong or canonical loop formula of M are generally quite difficult, since we have to decide the monotonicity of the dl-atoms occurring in P . The exact complexity of deciding if a set of atoms is a strong or canonical loop is one of our ongoing studies, in addition to the complexity of deciding if a given dl-program has a canonical answer set.\nAcknowledgment: We thank the anonymous reviewers for their detailed comments, which helped improve the presentation of the paper.

It implies that I \u2229L 6= \u2205. Without loss of generality, suppose L = {h1, . . . , hk} and h1 \u2208 I \u2229L. Because I is a weak answer set of K, I = lfp(\u03b3Kw,I ). It follows that h1 \u2208 lfp(\u03b3Kw,I ). Let k1 be the least number such that h1 \u2208 \u03b3k1+1Kw,I .

Thus I |=O wLF(L,K).\n(\u21d0) Firstly, we show I \u2286 lfp(\u03b3Kw,I ). Let \u0393 be the set of rules in wP IO whose bodies are satisfied by I . Since I is a supported model of K, the heads of rules in \u0393 are also satisfied by I . Moreover, I is the set of atoms occurring in \u0393. Let I \u2217 = lfp(\u03b3Kw,I\u0393 ), where K\u0393 = (O ,\u0393). Let I\u2212 = I \\ I \u2217 and \u0393I\u2212 be the set of rules in \u0393 whose heads are in I\u2212.

However Pos \\ I \u2217 6= \u2205 otherwise I \u2217 |= A for any A \u2208 Pos and then r /\u2208 \u0393I\u2212 . It implies that\nPos \u2229 (I \\ I \u2217) 6= \u2205\u00b7\nSuppose h \u2032 \u2208 Pos \u2229 I\u2212. Then there is an edge (h, h \u2032) in the weak positive dependency graph of (O ,\u0393I\u2212). So we can construct a sequence of atoms\n(h1, h2, . . . , hi , . . .)\nsuch that hi \u2208 I\u2212 for any i \u2265 1 and (hi , hi+1) is an edge of the weak positive dependency graph of (O ,\u0393I\u2212). Since I\u2212 is finite, the above sequence must contain a loop. It is clear that if a graph has a loop then it has at least one terminating loop. Now suppose L = {h1, . . . , hk} is a terminating loop of \u0393I\u2212 . We further claim that, for any rule (h \u2190 Pos) in \u0393I\u2212 such that h \u2208 L:\nI\u2212 \u2229 Pos \u2286 L\u00b7\nOtherwise, we can construct another path (h, h \u2032, . . .) in the positive weak dependency graph of (O ,\u0393I\u2212) such that h \u2032 \u2208 I \u2229 Pos and h \u2032 /\u2208 L. Thus we have a path from L to another maximal loop of the weak dependency graph of (O ,\u0393I\u2212), which contradicts the fact that L is a terminating loop.\nNote that L is also a weak loop of K, I |=O wLF(L,K) and L \u2286 I\u2212. It follows that P should have at least one rule\nr \u2032 : h \u2032 \u2190 Pos\u2032,not Neg\u2032\nsuch that Pos\u2032 \u2229 L = \u2205, I |=O A for any A \u2208 Pos\u2032 and I 6|=O B for any B \u2208 Neg\u2032, where h \u2032 \u2208 L. Suppose (r\u2217 : h \u2032 \u2190 Pos\u2217) is the rule obtained from r \u2032 by the weak dltransformation. Evidently, r\u2217 \u2208 \u0393. Furthermore r\u2217 \u2208 \u0393I\u2212 since h \u2032 \u2208 L \u2286 I\u2212. This implies that I\u2212 \u2229 Pos\u2217 \u2286 L which contradicts with Pos\u2217 \u2229 L = \u2205 since I\u2212 \u2229 Pos\u2217 6= \u2205. Consequently, I\u2212 = \u2205 and then I \u2286 I \u2217 = lfp(\u03b3Kw,I\u0393 ) \u2286 I . It implies that I = I\n\u2217 and I \u2286 lfp(\u03b3Kw,I ) by \u0393 \u2286 wP IO .\nSecondly, we prove lfp(\u03b3Kw,I ) \u2286 I . Let I \u2032 = lfp(\u03b3Kw,I ) \\ I . Suppose I \u2032 6= \u2205. Let h be an arbitrary atom in I \u2032. There is the least number k such that h \u2208 \u03b3k+1Kw,I . So that there exists a rule (r \u2032 : h \u2190 Pos) in wP IO such that Pos \u2286 \u03b3kKw,I . Note that h /\u2208 I and I |=O COMP(h,K).
