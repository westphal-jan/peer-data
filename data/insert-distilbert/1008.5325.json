Unfortunately, it is typically not possible to compute inference in closed-form in graphical models which involve such heavy-tailed distributions.\nIn this work, we propose a novel simple linear graphical model for independent latent random variables, called linear characteristic model (LCM), defined in the characteristic function domain. Using stable distributions, a heavy-tailed family of distributions which is a generalization of Cauchy, Le\u0301vy and Gaussian distributions, we show for the first time, how to compute both exact and approximate inference in such a linear multivariate graphical model. LCMs are not limited to stable distributions, in fact LCMs are always defined for any random variables (discrete, continuous or a mixture of both).\nWe provide a realistic problem from the field of computer networks to demonstrate the applicability of our construction. Other potential application is iterative decoding of linear channels with non-Gaussian noise."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Heavy-tailed distributions naturally occur in many real life phenomena, for example in computer networks [16, 8, 10]. Typically, a small set of machines are responsible for a large fraction of the consumed network bandwidth. Equivalently, a small set of users generate a large fraction of the network traffic. Another common property of communication networks is that network traffic tends to be linear [3, 16]. Linearity is explained by the fact that the total incoming traffic at a node is composed from the sum of distinct incoming flows.\nRecently, several works propose to use linear multivariate statistical methods for monitoring network health, performance analysis or intrusion detection [9, 7, 10, 8]. Some of the aspects of network traffic makes the task of modeling it using a probabilistic graphical models challenging. In many cases, the underlying heavy-tailed distributions are difficult to work with analytically. That is why existing solutions in the area of network monitoring involve various approximations of the joint probability distribution function using a variety of techniques: mixtures of distributions [3], spectral decomposition [7] historgrams [8], sketches [10], entropy [8], sampled moments [16], etc.\nIn the current work, we propose a novel linear probabilistic graphical model called linear characteristic model (LCM) to model linear interactions of independent heavy-tailed random variables (Section 3). Using the stable family of distributions (defined in Section 2), a family of heavy-tailed distributions, we show how to compute both exact and approximate inference (Section 4). Using real data from the domain of computer networks we demonstrate the applicability of our proposed methods for computing inference in LCM (Section 5).\nWe summarize our contributions below:\n\u2022 We propose a new linear graphical model called LCM, defined as a product of factors in the cf domain. We show that our model is well defined for any collection of random variables, since any random variable has a matching cf.\n\u2022 Computing inference in closed form in linear models involving continuous variables is typically limited to the well understood cases of Gaussians, Gaussian mixtures and simple regression problems in exponential families. In this work, we extend the applicability of belief propagation to the stable family of distributions, a generalization of Gaussian, Cauchy and Le\u0301vy distributions. We analyze both exact and approximate inference algorithms, including convergence and accuracy of the solution.\n\u2022 We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed method, performing inference in real settings, using tomography data obtained from the PlanetLab network."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related work", "text": "There are three main relevant works in the machine learning domain which are related to the current work: Convolutional Factor Graphs (CFG), Copulas and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Below we shortly review them and motivate why a new graphical model is needed.\nConvolutional Factor Graphs (CFG) [12, 13] are a graphical model for representing linear relation of independent latent random variables. CFG assume that the probability distribution factorizes as a product of potentials, and uses duality to derive a convolution factorization in the characteristic function (cf) domain. Unlike CFG, we assume that probability distribution factorizes as a product of potentials in the cf domain. There are two justifications for our new model: (a) LCMs are always defined, for any probability distribution, while CFG may are not defined when the inverse Fourier transform does not exist. (b) For certain distributions, as in the case of stable distribution, there is no closed-form pdf, thus it is not possible to compute inference in this case using CFG.\nA closely related technique is the Copula method [15, 11]. Similar to our work, Copulas assume a linear underlying model. The main difference is that Copulas transform each marginal variable into a uniform distribution and perform inference in the cumulative distribution function (cdf) domain. In contrast, we perform inference in the cf domain. In our case of interest, when the underlying distributions are stable, Copulas can not be used since stable distributions are not analytically expressible in the cdf domain.\nA third related technique is ICA (independent component analysis) on linear models [21]. Assuming a linear model Y = AX1, where the observations Y are given, the task is to estimate the linear relation matrix A, using only the fact that the latent variables X are statistically mutually independent. Both techniques (LCM and ICA) are complementary, since ICA can be used to learn the linear model, while LCM is used for computing inference in the learned model."}, {"heading": "2 Stable distribution", "text": "Stable distribution [23] is a family of heavy-tailed distributions, where Cauchy, Le\u0301vy and Gaussian are special instances of this family (see Figure 1). Stable distributions are used in different problem domains, including economics, physics, geology and astronomy [17]. Stable distribution are useful since they can model heavy-tailed distributions that naturally occur in practice. As we will soon show with our networking example, network flows exhibit empirical distribution which can be modeled remarkably well by stable distributions.\nWe denote a stable distribution by a tuple of four parameters: S(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4). We call \u03b1 as the characteristic exponent, \u03b2 is the skew parameter, \u03b3 is a scale parameter and \u03b4 is a shift parameter. For example (Fig. 1), a Gaussian N (\u00b5, \u03c32) is a stable distribution with the parameters S(2, 0, \u03c3\u221a\n2 , \u00b5),\na Cauchy distribution Cauchy(\u03b3, \u03b4) is stable with S(1, 0, \u03b3, \u03b4) and a Le\u0301vy distribution Le\u0301vy(\u03b3, \u03b4) s stable with S(12 , 1, \u03b3, \u03b4).

This fact makes the handling of stable distributions more difficult. This is probably one of the reasons stable distribution are rarely used in the probabilistic graphical models community.\nWe propose a novel approach for modeling linear interactions between random variables distributed according to stable distributions, using a new linear probabilistic graphical model called LCM. A new graphical model is needed, since previous approaches like CFG or the Copula method can not be used for computing inference in closed-form in linear models involving stable distribution, because they require computation in the pdf or cdf domains respectively.\nWe start by defining a linear model:\nDefinition 3.1. (Linear model) Let X1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Xn a set of mutually independent random variables.3 Let Y1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Ym be a set of observations obtained using the linear model:\nYi \u223c \u2211\nj\nAijXj \u2200i ,\nwhere Aij \u2208 R are weighting scalars. We denote the linear model in matrix notation as Y = AX .\n2We formally define characteristic function in the supplementary material. 3We do not limit the type of random variables in this definitions. The variables may be discrete, continuous,\nor a mixture of both.\nLinear models are useful in many domains. For example, in linear channel decoding, X are the transmitted codewords, the matrix A is the linear channel transformation and Y is a vector of observations. When X are distributed using a Gaussian distribution, the channel model is called AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise) channel. Typically, the decoding task is finding the most probable X, given A and the observation Y. Despite the fact that X are assumed statistically mutually independent when transmitting, given an observation Y , X are not independent any more, since they are correlated via the observation. Besides of the network application we focus on, other potential application to our current work is linear channel decoding with stable, non-Gaussian, noise.\nIn the rest of this section we develop the foundations for computing inference in a linear model using underlying stable distributions. Because stable distributions do not have closed-form equations in the pdf domain, we must work in the cf domain. Hence, we define a dual linear model in the cf domain."}, {"heading": "3.1 Duality of LCM and CFG", "text": "Given a linear model (Def. 3.1) the probability of the observation p(yi) is given as a convolution of the hidden variables that compose it [13]: p(yi) = p(x1) \u2217 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2217 p(xn) , \u2217 \u220f\nj=1...n\np(xj) ,\nwhere \u2217, \u2217 \u220f are the binary and multivariate convolution operators respectively.

We have analyzed the evolution dynamics of the update equations for Stable-Approx and derived sufficient conditions for convergence. Furthermore, we have analyzed the accuracy of the approximation. Not surprisingly, the sufficient condition for convergence relates to the properties of the scalar relation matrix A. The following theorem is one of the main novel contributions of this work. It provides both sufficient condition for convergence of Stable-Approx as well as closed-form equations for the fixed point.\nTheorem 4.5. Given a LCM with n i.i.d hidden variables Xi, n observations Yi distributed according to stable distribution Yi \u223c S(\u03b1, \u03b2yi , \u03b3yi , \u03b4yi), assuming the linear relation matrix An\u00d7n is positive definite and normalized to a unit diagonal7, Stable-Jacobi (as given in Algorithm 3) converges to a unique fixed point under both the following sufficient conditions for convergence (both should hold):\n(1) \u03c1(|R|\u03b1) < 1 , (2) \u03c1(R) < 1 .\nwhere \u03c1(R) is the spectral radius (the largest absolute value of the eigenvalues of R), andR , I\u2212A. Furthermore, the unique fixed points of convergence are given by equations (4)-(5). The algorithm converges to the exact marginals for the linear-stable channel.8"}, {"heading": "5 Application: Network flow monitoring", "text": "In this section we propose a novel application for inference in LCMs to model network traffic flows of a large operational worldwide testbed. This is an important problem in monitoring and anomaly detection of communication networks [9, 10, 3]. We obtained Netflow PlanetLab network data [5] collected on 25 January 2010. The PlanetLab network [20] is a distributed networking testbed with around 1000 server nodes scattered in about 500 sites around the world. We define a network flow as a directed edge between a transmitting and receiving hosts. The number of packets transmitted in this flow is the scalar edge weight.\nWe propose to use LCMs for modeling distribution of network flows. Figure 2(a) plots a distribution of flows, sorted by their bandwidth, on a typical PlanetLab node. Empirically, we found out that network flow distribution in a single PlanetLab node are fitted quite well using Le\u0301vy distribution a stable distribution with \u03b1 = 0.5, \u03b2 = 1. The empirical means are mean(\u03b3) \u2248 1e\u22124, mean(\u03b4) \u2248 1. For performing the fitting, we use Mark Veillette\u2019s Matlab stable distribution package [24].\n7When the matrix A is positive definite it is always possible to normalize it to a unit diagonal. The nor-\nmalized matrix is D\u2212 1 2AD\u2212 1\n2 where D = diag(A). Normalizing to a unit diagonal is done to simplify convergence analysis (as done for example in [6]) but does not limit the generality of the proposed method.\n8Note that there is an interesting relation to the walk-summability convergence condition [6] of belief propagation in the Gaussian case: \u03c1(|R|) < 1. However, our results are more general since they apply for any characteristic exponent 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 2 and not just for \u03b1 = 2 as in the Gaussian case.\nUsing previously proposed techniques utilizing histograms [10] for tracking flow distribution in Figure 2(a), we would need to store 40 values (percentage of bandwidth for each source port). In contrast, by approximating network flow distribution with stable distributions, we need only 4 parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4)! Thus we dramatically reduce storage requirements. Furthermore, using the developed theory in previous sections, we are able to linearly aggregate distribution of flows in clusters of nodes.\nWe extracted a connected component of traffic flows connecting the core network 652 nodes. We fitted a stable distribution characterizing flow behavior for each machine. A partition of 376 machines as the observed flows Yi (where flow distribution is known). The task is to predict the distribution of the unobserved remaining 376 flows Xi, based on the observed traffic flows (entries of Aij ). We run approximate inference using Stable-Approx and compared the results to the exact result computed by LCM-Elimination. We emphasize again, that using related techniques discussed in the related work section (Copula method , CFG, and ICA) it is not possible to compute exact inference for the problem at hand. Figure 2(c) plots convergence of the three parameters \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4 as a function of iteration number of the Stable-approx algorithm. Note that convergence speed is geometric. (\u03c1(A) = 0.02 << 1).\nRegarding computation overhead, LCM-Exact algorithm requires 4 \u00b7 3763 operations, while StableApprox converged to an accuracy of 1e\u22125 in only 4 \u00b7 3762 \u00b7 25 operations. Additional benefit of the Stable-Approx is that it is a distributed algorithm, naturally suitable for communication networks."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and future work", "text": "We have presented a novel linear graphical model called LCM, defined in the cf domain. We have shown for the first time how to perform exact and approximate inference in a linear multivariate graphical model when the underlying distributions are stable. We have discussed an application of our construction for computing inference of network flows.\nWe have proposed to borrow ideas from belief propagation, for computing efficient inference, based on the distributivity property of the slice-product operations and the integral-convolution operations. We believe that other problem domains may benefit from this construction, and plan to pursue this as a future work.\nWe believe there are several exciting directions for extending this work. Other families of distributions like geometric stable distributions or Wishart can be analyzed in our model.
