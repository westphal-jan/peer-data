Unlike other translations that modify the vocabulary of a logic program (Ben-Eliyahu and Dechter 1994; Lin and Zhao 2003; Janhunen 2006), the original\ntheorem on loop formulas characterizes the stable models of a nondisjunctive program in terms of the models of its completion that satisfy the loop formulas of all loops of the program. This allows us to compute stable models using SAT solvers, which led to the design of answer set solvers assat1 (Lin and Zhao 2004) and cmodels2 (Giunchiglia et al. 2004). Due to its importance in semantic understanding as well as in stable model computation, the theorem on loop formulas has been extended to more general classes of logic programs, such as disjunctive programs (Lee and Lifschitz 2003), infinite programs and programs containing classical negation (Lee 2005), and programs containing aggregates (Liu and Truszczynski 2006; You and Liu 2008; Lee and Meng 2009). Moreover, it has been applied to other nonmonotonic logics, such as circumscription (Lee and Lin 2006) and nonmonotonic causal logic (Lee 2004). The stable model semantics for first-order formulas given in (Ferraris et al. 2007; Ferraris et al. 2011) is also closely related to the idea of loop formulas, as described in (Lee and Meng 2008).\nBy slightly modifying the definition of a loop, Lee (2005) showed that loop formulas can be viewed as a generalization of completion (Clark 1978). The modeltheoretic account of loop formulas give in (Lee 2005) also tells us that the idea of loop formulas is closely related to assumption sets (Sacca\u0301 and Zaniolo 1990) or unfounded sets (Leone et al. 1997). In a sense, the theorem by Lin and Zhao is an enhancement of the unfounded set based characterization of stable models given in (Sacca\u0301 and Zaniolo 1990; Leone et al. 1997). The unfounded set based characterization takes into account the loop formulas of all sets of atoms, while the theorem by Lin and Zhao considers the loop formulas of loops only. Gebser and Schaub (2005) improved this enhancement even further. They defined the notion of an elementary loop of a nondisjunctive program and showed that the theorem by Lin and Zhao remains correct even if we consider loop formulas of elementary loops only.\nIn this article, we reformulate the definition of an elementary loop of a nondisjunctive program by Gebser and Schaub, extend it to disjunctive programs, and study several properties of elementary loops, including how maximal elementary loops are related to minimal unfounded sets. Based on the notion of an elementary loop, we present the class of Head-Elementary-loop-Free (HEF) program, which strictly generalizes the class of Head-Cycle-Free (HCF) programs due to Ben-Eliyahu and Dechter (1994). Like an HCF program, an HEF program can be turned into an equivalent nondisjunctive program in polynomial time by shifting head atoms into the body\u2014a simple transformation defined in (Gelfond et al. 1991). This tells us that an HEF program is an \u201ceasy\u201d disjunctive program, which is merely a syntactic variant of a nondisjunctive program. We also observe that several other properties of nondisjunctive and HCF programs can be generalized to HEF programs. The main results from (Lin and Zhao 2003) and (You et al. 2003), characterizing stable models in terms of inherent tightness and weak tightness, respectively, can be extended to HEF programs, and likewise the operational characterization of stable models of HCF programs due to Leone et al. (1997) can be extended to HEF pro-\n1 http://assat.cs.ust.hk/ 2 http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/tag/cmodels/\ngrams. The properties of elementary loops and HEF programs studied here may be useful in improving the computation of disjunctive answer set solvers, such as claspd3 (Drescher et al. 2008), cmodels (Lierler 2005), dlv4 (Leone et al. 2006), and gnt5 (Janhunen et al. 2006).\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we present our reformulated definition of an elementary loop of a nondisjunctive program and provide a corresponding refinement of the theorem on loop formulas, as well as some properties of elementary loops. These results are extended to disjunctive programs in Section 3. In Section 4, we introduce the class of HEF programs and show that their shifted variants preserve stable models. In Section 5, we generalize the notion of inherent tightness to HEF programs. An operational characterization of stable models of HEF programs is presented in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.\nThis paper is an extended version of the conference papers (Gebser et al. 2006)\nand (Gebser et al. 2007).6"}, {"heading": "2 Nondisjunctive Programs", "text": "After providing the relevant background on nondisjunctive programs, this section introduces elementary loops of nondisjunctive programs.

The dependency graph of Program \u03a01\nwhere B is a2, . . . , am and F is not am+1 , . . . , not an . We will sometimes identify B with its corresponding set of atoms.\nWe will identify an interpretation with the set of atoms that are true in it. We say that a set X of atoms satisfies a rule (1) if X satisfies (2). Moreover, X satisfies a nondisjunctive program \u03a0 (symbolically, X |= \u03a0) if X satisfies every rule (1) of \u03a0. If X satisfies \u03a0, we also call X a model of \u03a0.\nThe reduct \u03a0X of a nondisjunctive program \u03a0 w.r.t. a set X of atoms is obtained from \u03a0 by deleting each rule (3) such that X 6|= F , and replacing each remaining rule (3) with a1 \u2190 B. A set X of atoms is a stable model, also called an answer set, of \u03a0 if X is minimal among the sets of atoms that satisfy \u03a0X .\nThe (positive) dependency graph of a nondisjunctive program \u03a0 is the directed graph such that its vertices are the atoms occurring in \u03a0, and its edges go from a1 to a2, . . . , am for all rules (1) of \u03a0. A nonempty set Y of atoms is called a loop of \u03a0 if, for every pair a, b of atoms in Y , there is a path (possibly of length 0) from a to b in the dependency graph of \u03a0 such that all vertices in the path belong to Y . In other words, a nonempty set Y of atoms that occur in \u03a0 is a loop of \u03a0 if the subgraph of the dependency graph of \u03a0 induced by Y is strongly connected. It is clear that every singleton whose atom occurs in \u03a0 is a loop of \u03a0.\nFor illustration, consider the following program \u03a01:\np \u2190 not s p \u2190 r q \u2190 r r \u2190 p, q .\nFigure 1 shows the dependency graph of \u03a01. Program \u03a01 has seven loops: {p}, {q}, {r}, {s}, {p, r}, {q, r}, and {p, q, r}.\nFor any set Y of atoms, the external support formula of Y for a nondisjunctive program \u03a0, denoted by ES\u03a0(Y ), is the disjunction of conjunctions B \u2227 F for all rules (3) of \u03a0 such that a1 \u2208 Y and B \u2229 Y = \u2205. The first condition expresses that the atom \u201csupported\u201d by (3) is an element of Y . The second condition ensures that this support is \u201cexternal\u201d: the atoms in B that it relies on do not belong to Y . Thus, Y is called externally supported by \u03a0 w.r.t. a set X of atoms if X |= ES\u03a0(Y ).\nFor any set Y of atoms, by LF\u03a0(Y ), we denote the following formula:\n\u2227\na\u2208Y\na \u2192 ES\u03a0(Y ) . (4)\n(The expression in the antecedent stands for the conjunction of all elements in Y .) Formula (4) is called the (conjunctive) loop formula of Y for \u03a0. Note that we still call (4) a loop formula even when Y is not a loop of \u03a0.\nThe following reformulation of the Lin-Zhao theorem, which characterizes the\nstability of a model by loop formulas, is a part of the main theorem from (Lee 2005) for the nondisjunctive case.\nTheorem 1 ((Lee 2005))\nFor any nondisjunctive program \u03a0 and any set X of atoms that occur in \u03a0, if X is a model of \u03a0, then the following conditions are equivalent:\n(a) X is a stable model of \u03a0;\n(b) X satisfies LF\u03a0(Y ) for all nonempty sets Y of atoms that occur in \u03a0; (c) X satisfies LF\u03a0(Y ) for all loops Y of \u03a0.\nAccording to the equivalence between conditions (a) and (b) in Theorem 1, a model of \u03a01 is stable iff it satisfies the loop formulas of all fifteen nonempty sets of atoms formed from the atoms occurring in \u03a01. On the other hand, condition (c) tells us that it is sufficient to restrict attention to the following loop formulas of the seven loops of \u03a01:\np \u2192 \u00acs \u2228 r q \u2192 r r \u2192 p \u2227 q s \u2192 \u22a5 p \u2227 r \u2192 \u00acs q \u2227 r \u2192 \u22a5 p \u2227 q \u2227 r \u2192 \u00acs .\n(5)\nProgram \u03a01 has six models: {p}, {s}, {p, s}, {q, s}, {p, q, r}, and {p, q, r, s}. Among them, {p} is the only stable model of \u03a01, which is also the only model of \u03a01 that satisfies all loop formulas in (5).\nAs noted in (Lee 2005), the equivalence between conditions (a) and (c) is a reformulation of the theorem by Lin and Zhao; the equivalence between conditions (a) and (b) is a reformulation of Corollary 2 from (Sacca\u0301 and Zaniolo 1990) and Theorem 4.6 from (Leone et al. 1997) (in the nondisjunctive case), which characterizes the stability of a model in terms of unfounded sets. For any sets X , Y of atoms, we say that Y is unfounded by \u03a0 w.r.t. X if Y is not externally supported by \u03a0 w.r.t. X . Condition (b) can be stated in terms of unfounded sets as follows:\n(b\u2032) X contains no nonempty unfounded sets for \u03a0 w.r.t. X ."}, {"heading": "2.2 Elementary Loops of Nondisjunctive Programs", "text": "Gebser and Schaub (2005) showed that Y in LF\u03a0(Y ) in Theorem 1 can be restricted to \u201celementary\u201d loops only. In this section, we present a reformulation of their definition of an elementary loop and investigate its properties. We compare our reformulation with the original definition by Gebser and Schaub in Section 2.5.\nTo begin with, the following proposition tells us that a loop can be defined without\nmentioning a dependency graph.\nProposition 1 For any nondisjunctive program \u03a0 and any nonempty set X of atoms that occur in \u03a0, X is a loop of \u03a0 iff, for every nonempty proper subset Y of X , there is a rule (3) in \u03a0 such that a1 \u2208 Y and B \u2229 (X \\ Y ) 6= \u2205.\nFor any set X of atoms and any subset Y of X , we say that Y is outbound in X\nfor a nondisjunctive program \u03a0 if there is a rule (3) in \u03a0 such that\n\u2022 a1 \u2208 Y , \u2022 B \u2229 (X \\ Y ) 6= \u2205, and \u2022 B \u2229 Y = \u2205.\nThe following proposition describes the relationship between the external support\nformula of a set Y of atoms and the external support formula of a subset Z of Y that is not outbound in Y .\nProposition 2 For any nondisjunctive program \u03a0 and any sets X , Y , Z of atoms such that Z \u2286 Y \u2286 X , if Z is not outbound in Y for \u03a0 and X |= ES\u03a0(Z), then X |= ES\u03a0(Y ).\nProposition 2 tells us that, in order to verify that a set Y of atoms is externally supported by \u03a0 w.r.t. a superset X of Y , it is sufficient to identify some externally supported subset of Y that is not outbound in Y for \u03a0. Conversely, if Y is not externally supported by \u03a0 w.r.t. X , then every subset of Y that is externally supported by \u03a0 w.r.t. X is outbound in Y for \u03a0.\nFor any nonempty set X of atoms that occur in \u03a0, we say that X is an elementary loop of \u03a0 if all nonempty proper subsets of X are outbound in X for \u03a0. As with loops, it is clear from the definition that every singleton whose atom occurs in \u03a0 is an elementary loop of \u03a0. It is also clear that every elementary loop of \u03a0 is a loop of \u03a0: the condition for being an elementary loop implies the condition for being a loop as stated in Proposition 1. On the other hand, a loop is not necessarily an elementary loop. For instance, one can check that {p, q, r} is not an elementary loop of \u03a01 since {p, r} (or {q, r}) is not outbound in {p, q, r} for \u03a01. All other loops of \u03a01 are elementary loops. Note that an elementary loop may be a proper subset of another elementary loop (both {p} and {p, r} are elementary loops of \u03a01).\nThe following program replaces the last rule of \u03a01 with two other rules:\np \u2190 not s p \u2190 r q \u2190 r r \u2190 p r \u2190 q .\n(6)\nThe program has the same dependency graph as \u03a01, and hence has the same loops. However, its elementary loops are different from those of \u03a01: all its loops are elementary loops as well, including {p, q, r}.\nThe definition of an elementary loop X given above is not affected if we check the outboundness condition only for all loops or for all elementary loops that belong to X instead of all nonempty proper subsets of X .\nProposition 3 For any nondisjunctive program \u03a0 and any nonempty set X of atoms that occur in \u03a0, X is an elementary loop of \u03a0 iff all proper subsets of X that are elementary loops of \u03a0 are outbound in X for \u03a0.\nThe following proposition describes an important relationship between loop for-\nmulas of elementary loops and loop formulas of arbitrary sets of atoms.\nProposition 4 For any nondisjunctive program \u03a0 and any nonempty set Y of atoms that occur in \u03a0, there is an elementary loop Z of \u03a0 such that Z is a subset of Y and LF\u03a0(Z) entails LF\u03a0(Y ).\nProposition 4 allows us to limit attention to loop formulas of elementary loops only. This yields the following theorem, which is a reformulation of Theorem 3 from (Gebser and Schaub 2005).\nTheorem 1 (d) The following condition is equivalent to each of conditions (a)\u2013(c) in Theorem 1:\n(d) X satisfies LF\u03a0(Y ) for all elementary loops Y of \u03a0.\nFor instance, according to Theorem 1 (d), a model of \u03a01 is stable iff it satisfies the first six loop formulas in (5); the loop formula of the non-elementary loop {p, q, r} (the last one in (5)) can be disregarded."}, {"heading": "2.3 Elementarily Unfounded Sets for Nondisjunctive Programs", "text": "If we modify condition (c) in Theorem 1 by replacing \u201cloops\u201d in its statement with \u201cmaximal loops,\u201d the condition becomes weaker, and the modified statement of Theorem 1 is incorrect. For instance, \u03a01 has only two maximal loops, {p, q, r} and {s}, and their loop formulas are satisfied by a non-stable model {p, q, r}. In fact, maximal loop {p, q, r} is not even an elementary loop of \u03a01. Similarly, it is not sufficient to consider maximal elementary loops only. If we replace \u201celementary loops\u201d in the statement of Theorem 1 (d) with \u201cmaximal elementary loops,\u201d then the modified statement is incorrect. For instance, the program\np \u2190 q, not p q \u2190 p, not p p \u2190 .\nhas two models, {p} and {p, q}, among which the latter is not stable. On the other hand, the only maximal elementary loop of the program is {p, q}, and its loop formula p \u2227 q \u2192 \u22a4 is satisfied by both models, so that this loop formula alone is not sufficient to refute the stability of {p, q}. (Model {p, q} does not satisfy the loop formula of {q}, which is q \u2192 p \u2227 \u00acp.)\nHowever, in the following we show that, if we consider the \u201crelevant\u201d part of a program w.r.t. a given interpretation, it is sufficient to restrict attention to maximal elementary loops. For any nondisjunctive program \u03a0 and any set X of atoms, by\n\u03a0X , we denote the set of all rules (3) of \u03a0 such that X |= B,F . The following proposition states that all nonempty proper subsets of an elementary loop of \u03a0X are externally supported by \u03a0 w.r.t. X .\nProposition 5 For any nondisjunctive program \u03a0, any set X of atoms, and any elementary loop Y of \u03a0X , X satisfies ES\u03a0(Z) for all nonempty proper subsets Z of Y .\nProposition 5 tells us that any elementary loop Y of \u03a0X that is unfounded by \u03a0 w.r.t. X is maximal among the elementary loops of \u03a0X . From this, we obtain the following result.\nTheorem 1 (e) The following condition is equivalent to each of conditions (a)\u2013(c) in Theorem 1:\n(e) X satisfies LF\u03a0(Y ) for every set Y of atoms such that Y is\n\u2014 a maximal elementary loop of \u03a0X , or \u2014 a singleton whose atom occurs in \u03a0.\nGiven a nondisjunctive program \u03a0 and a set X of atoms, we say that a set Y of\natoms that occur in \u03a0 is elementarily unfounded by \u03a0 w.r.t. X if Y is\n\u2022 an elementary loop of \u03a0X that is unfounded by \u03a0 w.r.t. X or \u2022 a singleton that is unfounded by \u03a0 w.r.t. X .7\nProposition 5 tells us that any non-singleton elementarily unfounded set for \u03a0 w.r.t. X is a maximal elementary loop of \u03a0X .\nIt is clear from the definition that every elementarily unfounded set for \u03a0 w.r.t. X is an elementary loop of \u03a0 and that it is also unfounded by \u03a0 w.r.t. X . However, the converse does not hold in general. For instance, {p, q} is an elementary loop that is unfounded by the program\np \u2190 q, not r q \u2190 p, not r\nw.r.t. {p, q, r}, but {p, q} is not an elementarily unfounded set w.r.t. {p, q, r}.\nThe following corollary, which follows from Proposition 5, states that all nonempty proper subsets of an elementarily unfounded set are externally supported. It is essentially a reformulation of Theorem 5 from (Gebser and Schaub 2005).\nCorollary 1 For any nondisjunctive program \u03a0, any set X of atoms, and any elementarily unfounded set Y for \u03a0 w.r.t. X , X does not satisfy ES\u03a0(Y ), but satisfies ES\u03a0(Z) for all nonempty proper subsets Z of Y .\nCorollary 1 tells us that elementarily unfounded sets form an \u201canti-chain\u201d: one of them cannot be a proper subset of another. (On the other hand, an elementary loop may contain another elementary loop as its proper subset.) Also it tells us that elementarily unfounded sets are minimal among the nonempty unfounded sets occurring in \u03a0. Interestingly, the converse also holds.\n7 Elementarily unfounded sets are closely related to \u201cactive elementary loops\u201d defined in (Gebser and Schaub 2005). We further investigate this relationship in Section 2.5.\nTheorem 2\nFor any nondisjunctive program \u03a0 and any sets X , Y of atoms, Y is an elementarily unfounded set for \u03a0 w.r.t. X iff Y is minimal among the nonempty sets of atoms occurring in \u03a0 that are unfounded by \u03a0 w.r.t. X .\nNotably, the correspondence between elementarily unfounded sets and minimal nonempty unfounded sets has also led to an alternative characterization of UEmodels (Gebser et al. 2008), which characterizes uniform equivalence (Eiter and Fink 2003) of nondisjunctive programs as well as disjunctive programs.\nSimilar to Theorem 1 (b\u2032), Theorem 1 (e) can be stated in terms of elementarily unfounded sets, thereby restricting attention to minimal nonempty unfounded sets.\nTheorem 1 (e\u2032)\nThe following condition is equivalent to each of conditions (a)\u2013(c) in Theorem 1:\n(e\u2032) X contains no elementarily unfounded sets for \u03a0 w.r.t. X .\nThe notion of an elementarily unfounded set may help improve computation performed by SAT-based answer set solvers. Since there are exponentially many \u201crelevant\u201d loops in the worst case (Lifschitz and Razborov 2006), SAT-based answer set solvers do not add all loop formulas at once. Instead, they check whether a model returned by a SAT solver is stable. If not, a loop formula that is not satisfied by the model is added, and the SAT solver is invoked again. This process is repeated until a stable model is found or the search space is exhausted. In view of Theorem 1 (e\u2032), it is sufficient to restrict attention to elementarily unfounded sets during the computation. This ensures that the considered loop formulas belong to elementary loops. Since every elementary loop is a loop, but not vice versa, the computation may involve fewer loop formulas overall than in the case when arbitrary loops are considered. However, whether this idea will lead to more efficient computation in practice requires further investigation."}, {"heading": "2.4 Recognizing Elementary Loops of Nondisjunctive Programs", "text": "The definition of an elementary loop given in Section 2.2 involves considering all its nonempty proper subsets (or at least all elementary loops that are subsets). This may seem to imply that deciding whether a given set of atoms is an elementary loop is a computationally hard problem. However, Gebser and Schaub (2005) showed that this is not the case for nondisjunctive programs. They also noted that the notion of a positive dependency graph is not expressive enough to distinguish between elementary and non-elementary loops (Program \u03a01 and the program in (6) have the same dependency graph, but their elementary loops are different), and instead used the rather complicated notion of a body-head dependency graph to identify elementary loops. In this section, we simplify their result by still referring to a positive dependency graph. We show that removing some unnecessary edges from a positive dependency graph is just enough to distinguish between elementary and non-elementary loops.\np qr q )\nThis is a \u201cbottom-up\u201d construction based on strongly connected components, i.e., maximal strongly connected subgraphs of a given graph. Thus EC i\u03a0(X) is a subset of EC i+1\u03a0 (X), and the graph (X,EC\u03a0(X)) is a subgraph of the positive dependency graph of \u03a0. We call the graph (X,EC\u03a0(X)) the elementary subgraph of X for \u03a0. Figure 2 shows the elementary subgraph of {p, q, r} for \u03a01, which is not strongly connected.\nThe following theorem is similar to Theorem 10 from (Gebser and Schaub 2005), but instead of referring to the notion of a body-head dependency graph, it refers to the notion of an elementary subgraph.\nTheorem 3 For any nondisjunctive program \u03a0 and any nonempty set X of atoms that occur in \u03a0, X is an elementary loop of \u03a0 iff the elementary subgraph ofX for \u03a0 is strongly connected.\nSince an elementary subgraph can be constructed in polynomial time, the problem of deciding whether a given set of atoms is an elementary loop of a nondisjunctive program is tractable."}, {"heading": "2.5 Comparison with Gebser-Schaub Definition", "text": "In this section, we compare our reformulation of elementary loops with the original definition by Gebser and Schaub (2005) for nondisjunctive programs.\nLet \u03a0 be a nondisjunctive program. A loop of \u03a0 is called trivial if it consists of a single atom such that the dependency graph of \u03a0 does not contain an edge from the atom to itself, and nontrivial otherwise.8 For a nontrivial loop L of \u03a0, let\n\u2022 R\u2212\u03a0(L) = {(3) \u2208 \u03a0 | a1 \u2208 L, B \u2229 L = \u2205}, and \u2022 R+\u03a0(L) = {(3) \u2208 \u03a0 | a1 \u2208 L, B \u2229 L 6= \u2205}.\nDefinition 1 ((Gebser and Schaub 2005)) A nontrivial loop L of a nondisjunctive program \u03a0 is called a GS-elementary loop of \u03a0 if R\u2212\u03a0(L \u2032) \u2229R+\u03a0(L) 6= \u2205 for all proper subsets L \u2032 of L that are nontrivial loops of \u03a0.\n8 In (Lin and Zhao 2004) and (Gebser and Schaub 2005), loops were defined to be nontrivial.\nProposition 6\nFor any nondisjunctive program \u03a0 and any set L of atoms, L is a GS-elementary loop of \u03a0 iff L is a nontrivial elementary loop of \u03a0.\nProof. From left to right: Assume that L is a GS-elementary loop of \u03a0. If L is a singleton, it is a (nontrivial) elementary loop according to our definition. If L is not a singleton, we have that R\u2212\u03a0(L \u2032) \u2229 R+\u03a0(L) 6= \u2205 for any proper subset L \u2032 of L that is a nontrivial loop of \u03a0. In other words, there is a rule (3) in \u03a0 such that\na1 \u2208 L \u2032, (7)\nB \u2229 L\u2032 = \u2205, (8)\nand\nB \u2229 (L \\ L\u2032) 6= \u2205. (9)\nWe thus have that L\u2032 is outbound in L for \u03a0. Furthermore, for any trivial loop {a1} of \u03a0 contained in L, there must be a rule (3) in \u03a0 such that B \u2229 (L \\ {a1}) 6= \u2205, as L cannot be a loop of \u03a0 otherwise. Since {a1} is trivial, B \u2229 {a1} = \u2205, so that {a1} is outbound in L for \u03a0. By Proposition 3, it follows that L is a (nontrivial) elementary loop of \u03a0.\nFrom right to left: Assume that L is a nontrivial elementary loop of \u03a0. From the definition of an elementary loop, it follows that any proper subset L\u2032 of L that is a nontrivial loop of \u03a0 is outbound in L for \u03a0. That is, there is a rule (3) in \u03a0 such that (7), (8), and (9) hold, so that L is a GS-elementary loop of \u03a0.\nFor a nondisjunctive program \u03a0 and a set X of atoms, a loop L of \u03a0X is a GS-elementary loop of \u03a0X iff L is a nontrivial elementary loop of \u03a0X . Thus an active elementary loop of \u03a0 according to (Gebser and Schaub 2005) is a nontrivial elementary loop of \u03a0X that is unfounded by \u03a0 w.r.t. X . Hence, any active elementary loop L of \u03a0 is an elementarily unfounded set for \u03a0 w.r.t. X , while the converse does not hold in general if L is a singleton.\nIn fact, there are a few differences between Definition 1 and our definition of an elementary loop. First, our definition of an elementary loop does not a priori assume that its atoms form a loop. Rather, the fact that an elementary loop is a loop follows from its definition in view of Proposition 1. Second, the two definitions do not agree on trivial loops: a trivial loop is an elementary loop, but not a GSelementary loop. This originates from the difference between the definition of a loop in (Lin and Zhao 2004) and its reformulation given in (Lee 2005). As shown in the main theorem from (Lee 2005), identifying a trivial loop as a loop admits a simpler reformulation of the Lin-Zhao theorem by allowing us to view completion formulas (Clark 1978) as a special case of loop formulas. Furthermore, the reformulated definition of an elementary loop enables us to identify a close relationship between maximal elementary loops (elementarily unfounded sets) and minimal nonempty unfounded sets.\nImportantly, trivial loops allow us to extend the notion of an elementary loop to disjunctive programs without producing counterintuitive results. For instance,\nconsider the following disjunctive program:\np ; q \u2190 r p ; r \u2190 q q ; r \u2190 p .\n(10)\nThe nontrivial loops of this program are {p, q}, {p, r}, {q, r}, and {p, q, r}, but not the singletons {p}, {q}, and {r}. If we were to extend GS-elementary loops to disjunctive programs, a natural extension would say that {p, q, r} is a GSelementary loop since {p, q}, {p, r}, and {q, r} are \u201coutbound\u201d in {p, q, r}. But note that {p, q, r} is unfounded w.r.t. {p, q, r}; moreover, every singleton is also unfounded w.r.t {p, q, r}. This is in contrast with Proposition 5, according to which all nonempty proper subsets of an elementary loop should be externally supported. The next section shows that such an anomaly does not arise with our definition of an elementary loop that is extended to disjunctive programs."}, {"heading": "3 Disjunctive Programs", "text": "After providing the relevant background on disjunctive programs, this section generalizes the notions of an elementary loop and an elementarily unfounded set to disjunctive programs. We also provide the proofs of the generalizations of the statements given in the previous section; such generalized results also apply to the class of nondisjunctive programs as a fragment of disjunctive programs. Furthermore, we show that, in contrast to nondisjunctive programs, recognizing an elementary loop is intractable in the case of arbitrary disjunctive programs, but stays tractable under a certain syntactic condition."}, {"heading": "3.1 Background", "text": "A disjunctive rule is an expression of the form\na1; . . . ; ak \u2190 ak+1, . . . , al, not al+1 , . . . , not am , not not am+1 , . . . , not not an (11) where n \u2265 m \u2265 l \u2265 k \u2265 0 and a1, . . . , an are propositional atoms. A disjunctive program is a finite set of disjunctive rules. Note that any program with nested expressions can be turned into an equivalent program whose rules are of the form (11) (Lifschitz et al. 1999).\nWe will identify a disjunctive rule (11) with the propositional formula\nak+1 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 al \u2227 \u00acal+1 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 \u00acam \u2227 \u00ac\u00acam+1 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 \u00ac\u00acan \u2192 a1 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 ak\nand will often write (11) as\nA \u2190 B,F (12)\nwhere A is a1, . . . , ak, B is ak+1, . . . , al, and F is\nnot al+1 , . . . , not am , not not am+1 , . . . , not not an .\nWe will sometimes identify A and B with their corresponding sets of atoms.\nThe reduct \u03a0X of a disjunctive program \u03a0 w.r.t. a set X of atoms is obtained from \u03a0 by deleting each rule (12) such that X 6|= F , and replacing each remaining rule (12) with A \u2190 B. A set X of atoms is a stable model, also called an answer set, of \u03a0 if X is minimal among the sets of atoms that satisfy \u03a0X .\nThe definition of a (positive) dependency graph is extended to a disjunctive program \u03a0 in the straightforward way: the vertices of the graph are the atoms occurring in \u03a0, and its edges go from the elements of A to the elements of B for all rules (12) of \u03a0. With this extended definition of a dependency graph, the definition of a loop for a nondisjunctive program is straightforwardly extended to a disjunctive program.\nFor any set Y of atoms, the external support formula of Y for a disjunctive\nprogram \u03a0, denoted by ES\u03a0(Y ), is the disjunction of conjunctions\nB \u2227 F \u2227 \u2227\na\u2208A\\Y\n\u00aca\nfor all rules (12) of \u03a0 such that A\u2229Y 6= \u2205 and B\u2229Y = \u2205. When \u03a0 is a nondisjunctive program, this definition reduces to the definition of ES\u03a0(Y ) for nondisjunctive programs given earlier. As before, we say that Y is externally supported by \u03a0 w.r.t. a set X of atoms if X |= ES\u03a0(Y ); Y is unfounded \u03a0 w.r.t. X if X 6|= ES\u03a0(Y ).\nThe notion of LF\u03a0(Y ) and the term (conjunctive) loop formula similarly apply\nto formulas (4) when \u03a0 is a disjunctive program.\nAs shown in (Lee 2005), Theorem 1 remains correct after replacing \u201cnondisjunc-\ntive program\u201d in its statement with \u201cdisjunctive program.\u201d\nTheoremd 1 ((Lee 2005)) For any disjunctive program \u03a0 and any set X of atoms that occur in \u03a0, if X is a model of \u03a0, then the following conditions are equivalent: 9\n(a) X is a stable model of \u03a0; (b) X satisfies LF\u03a0(Y ) for all nonempty sets Y of atoms that occur in \u03a0;\n(b\u2032) X contains no nonempty unfounded sets for \u03a0 w.r.t.

From left to right: Assume that X is a loop of \u03a0. If X is a singleton, it is clear. If X is not a singleton, take any nonempty proper subset Y of X . Since both Y and X \\ Y are nonempty, there is a path from some atom in Y to some atom in X \\Y in the dependency graph of \u03a0 such that all vertices in the path belong to X . This implies that there is an edge from an atom in Y to an atom in X \\ Y , i.e., A \u2229 Y 6= \u2205 and B \u2229 (X \\ Y ) 6= \u2205 for some rule (12) in \u03a0.\nFrom right to left: Assume that X is not a loop of \u03a0. Then the subgraph of the dependency graph of \u03a0 induced byX is not strongly connected. Consequently, there is a nonempty proper subset Y of X such that no edge connects an atom in Y to an atom in X \\ Y . This implies that there is no rule (12) in \u03a0 such that A\u2229 Y 6= \u2205 and B \u2229 (X \\ Y ) 6= \u2205.\nFor any set X of atoms and any subset Y of X , we say that Y is outbound in X\nfor a disjunctive program \u03a0 if there is a rule (12) in \u03a0 such that\n\u2022 A \u2229 Y 6= \u2205, \u2022 B \u2229 (X \\ Y ) 6= \u2205, \u2022 A \u2229 (X \\ Y ) = \u2205, and \u2022 B \u2229 Y = \u2205.\nAs with nondisjunctive programs, for any nonempty set X of atoms that occur in \u03a0, we say that X is an elementary loop of \u03a0 if all nonempty proper subsets of X are outbound in X for \u03a0. Clearly, every singleton whose atom occurs in \u03a0 is an elementary loop of \u03a0, and every elementary loop of \u03a0 is a loop of \u03a0. The definition of an elementary loop of a disjunctive program is stronger than the alternative characterization of a loop provided in Propositiond 1: it requires that the rule (12) satisfy two additional conditions, A \u2229 (X \\ Y ) = \u2205 and B \u2229 Y = \u2205.\nTo illustrate the definition of an elementary loop of a disjunctive program, consider the loop {p, q, r} of the program in (10). The loop is not an elementary loop because, for instance, {p} is not outbound in {p, q, r}: although the first two rules (12) in (10) are such that A\u2229{p} 6= \u2205, B\u2229{q, r} 6= \u2205, and B\u2229{p} = \u2205, we also have that A\u2229{q, r} 6= \u2205 for each of them. Similarly, {q} and {r} are not outbound in {p, q, r}. On the other hand, the remaining loops of the program, {p}, {q}, {r}, {p, q}, {p, r}, and {q, r}, are elementary loops.\nWith the extended definitions given above, Propositions 2, 3, 4 and Theorem 1 (d) remain correct after replacing \u201cnondisjunctive program\u201d in their statements with \u201cdisjunctive program.\u201d In the following, we present proofs for these generalizations.\nPropositiond 2 For any disjunctive program\u03a0 and any setsX , Y , Z of atoms such that Z \u2286 Y \u2286 X , if Z is not outbound in Y for \u03a0 and X |= ES\u03a0(Z), then X |= ES\u03a0(Y ).\nProof. Assume that Z is not outbound in Y for \u03a0 and that X |= ES\u03a0(Z).

(21)\nFinally, from (16), (18), (19), and (21), we conclude that X |= ES\u03a0(Y ).\nPropositiond 3 For any disjunctive program \u03a0 and any nonempty set X of atoms that occur in \u03a0, X is an elementary loop of \u03a0 iff all proper subsets of X that are elementary loops of \u03a0 are outbound in X for \u03a0.\nProof. From left to right is clear.\nFrom right to left: Assume that X is not an elementary loop of \u03a0. Then there is a nonempty proper subset Y of X that is not outbound in X for \u03a0. If Y is an elementary loop of \u03a0, it is clear. Otherwise, there is a nonempty proper subset Z of Y that is not outbound in Y for \u03a0.

(28)\nSince Z is not outbound in Y for \u03a0, from (22), (25), and (28), it follows that\nB \u2229 (Y \\ Z) = \u2205 ,\nwhich, in combination with (23) and (25), gives us that\nB \u2229 Y = \u2205 (29)\nand\nB \u2229 (X \\ Y ) 6= \u2205 . (30)\nHowever, (26), (27), (29), and (30) together contradict that Y is not outbound in X for \u03a0, from which we conclude that Z is not outbound in X for \u03a0. We have thus shown that every nonempty proper subset of X that is not outbound in X for \u03a0 and not an elementary loop of \u03a0 contains in turn a nonempty proper subset that is not outbound in X for \u03a0. Since X is finite, there is some (not necessarily unique) minimal nonempty proper subset of X that is not outbound in X for \u03a0, and such a subset must be an elementary loop of \u03a0.\nPropositiond 4\nFor any disjunctive program \u03a0 and any nonempty set Y of atoms that occur in \u03a0, there is an elementary loop Z of \u03a0 such that Z is a subset of Y and LF\u03a0(Z) entails LF\u03a0(Y ).\nProof. If Y is an elementary loop of \u03a0, it is clear. Otherwise, by Propositiond 3, some proper subset Z of Y is an elementary loop of \u03a0 that is not outbound in Y for \u03a0.

X , from (37), (39), and (42), it follows that\nB \u2229 Y 6= \u2205 ,\nwhich, in combination with (38), gives us that\nB \u2229 (Y \\ Z) 6= \u2205 . (43)\nIn view of (39) and (42), we have that the rule (12) is contained in \u03a0X,Y . From (37), (38), (41), and (43), we further conclude that Z is outbound in Y for \u03a0X,Y . Consequently, Y is an elementary loop of \u03a0X,Y and elementarily unfounded by \u03a0 w.r.t.X .\nTheorem 1 (e) and (e\u2032) can now be extended to disjunctive programs as follows.\nTheoremd 1 (e\u2032) The following conditions are equivalent to each of conditions (a)\u2013(c) in Theoremd 1:\n(e) X satisfies LF\u03a0(Y ) for every set Y of atoms such that Y is\n\u2014 maximal among all sets Z of atoms that are elementary loops of \u03a0X,Z or \u2014 a singleton whose atom occurs in \u03a0;\n(e\u2032) X contains no elementarily unfounded sets for \u03a0 w.r.t. X .\nProof. We first show the equivalence between (b\u2032) and (e\u2032): from (b\u2032) to (e\u2032) is clear, and from (e\u2032) to (b\u2032) follows immediately from Theoremd 2. Moreover, the equivalence between (e\u2032) and (e) holds in view of Propositiond 5, which tells us that an elementarily unfounded set Y for \u03a0 w.r.t. X cannot be a proper subset of any set Z of atoms that is an elementary loop of \u03a0X,Z ."}, {"heading": "3.4 Recognizing Elementary Loops of Disjunctive Programs", "text": "Although deciding whether a given set of atoms is an elementary loop of a nondisjunctive program can be done efficiently, it turns out that the corresponding problem in the case of arbitrary disjunctive programs is intractable.\nTheorem 4 For any disjunctive program \u03a0 and any set Y of atoms, deciding whether Y is an elementary loop of \u03a0 is coNP-complete.\nProof. Containment in coNP is clear, since it is easy to check that a given nonempty proper subset of Y is not outbound in Y for \u03a0.\nFor coNP-hardness, we reduce the coNP-hard problem of deciding whether a finite set X of atoms is \u201cunfounded-free\u201d for a disjunctive program \u03a0 (Leone et al. 1997), i.e., X contains no nonempty unfounded sets for \u03a0 w.r.t. X . Using a new atom e that does not occur in \u03a0 or X , we construct a program \u03a0\u2032 as follows: for every rule (12) of \u03a0X , include a rule A \u2190 e,B, F in \u03a0\u2032, and, for every a \u2208 X \u222a {e}, include a rule e \u2190 a in \u03a0\u2032. Given the rules of the latter type, it is clear that any proper subset Z of Y = X \u222a{e} that is not outbound in Y for \u03a0\u2032 cannot contain e. For every rule (12) of \u03a0\u2032 such that A 6= {e}, since e \u2208 B, we then have that\nB \u2229 (Y \\ Z) 6= \u2205 .\nHence, if a nonempty proper subset Z of Y is not outbound in Y for \u03a0\u2032, for every rule (12) of \u03a0\u2032 such that A 6= {e}, at least one of the following conditions holds:\nA \u2229 Z = \u2205 , (44)\nA \u2229 (Y \\ Z) 6= \u2205 , (45)\nor\nB \u2229 Z 6= \u2205 . (46)\nSince e /\u2208 A, (45) implies that\nA \u2229 (X \\ Z) 6= \u2205 . (47)\nWe have thus shown that (44), (46), or (47) holds for every rule (12) of \u03a0\u2032 such that A 6= {e}, and, similarly, for every rule (12) of \u03a0X . Furthermore, we have that\nX 6|= B,F (48)\nfor every rule (12) of \u03a0 \\\u03a0X . Consequently, (44), (46), (47), or (48) holds for every rule (12) of \u03a0, which shows that Z is unfounded by \u03a0 w.r.t. X . Conversely, if a nonempty subset Z of X is unfounded by \u03a0 w.r.t. X , the fact that (44), (46), or (47) holds for every rule (12) of \u03a0X implies that every rule (12) of \u03a0 \u2032 satisfies (44), (45), or (46), so that Z is not outbound in Y for \u03a0\u2032. Consequently, we conclude that X is unfounded-free for \u03a0 iff Y = X \u222a {e} is an elementary loop of \u03a0\u2032.\nHowever, for the class of disjunctive programs called \u201cHead-Cycle-Free\u201d (Ben-Eliyahu and Dechter 1994),\ndeciding whether a set of atoms is an elementary loop is tractable. We say that a disjunctive program \u03a0 is Head-Cycle-Free (HCF) if |A \u2229 Y | \u2264 1 for every rule (12) of \u03a0 and every loop Y of \u03a0.\nThe definition of an elementary subgraph for a nondisjunctive program can be extended to disjunctive programs by modifying the equation for EC i+1\u03a0 as follows:\nEC i+1\u03a0 (X) = {(a, b) | there is a rule (12) in \u03a0 such that A \u2229X = {a},\nb \u2208 B \u2229X , and all atoms in B \u2229X belong to the same strongly connected component in (X,EC i\u03a0(X))} .\nWith this extended definition of an elementary subgraph, Theorem 3 remains correct after replacing \u201cnondisjunctive program\u201d in its statement with \u201cHCF program.\u201d\nIn the next section, we introduce \u201cHead-Elementary-loop-Free\u201d programs, and\nshow that Theorem 3 can be further generalized to such programs."}, {"heading": "4 Head-Elementary-Loop-Free Programs", "text": "In general, computing stable models of a disjunctive program is harder than computing stable models of a nondisjunctive program (Eiter and Gottlob 1995). On the other hand, HCF programs are \u201ceasy\u201d disjunctive programs that can be turned into equivalent nondisjunctive programs in polynomial time (Ben-Eliyahu and Dechter 1994). This property plays an important role in the computation of stable models of disjunctive programs, and is used by answer set solvers claspd, cmodels, and dlv.\nBy referring to elementary loops in place of loops in the definition of an HCF program, we define a class of programs that is more general than HCF programs: we say that a disjunctive program \u03a0 is Head-Elementary-loop-Free (HEF) if |A\u2229Y | \u2264 1 for every rule (12) of \u03a0 and every elementary loop Y of \u03a0. Since every elementary loop is also a loop, it is clear that every HCF program is an HEF program as well. However, not all HEF programs are HCF. For example, consider the following program \u03a02:\np \u2190 r q \u2190 r r \u2190 p, q p ; q \u2190 .\nThis program has six loops: {p}, {q}, {r}, {p, r}, {q, r}, and {p, q, r}. Since the head of the last rule contains two atoms from the loop {p, q, r}, \u03a02 is not HCF. On the other hand, \u03a02 is HEF since {p, q, r} is not an elementary loop of \u03a02: its subsets {p, r} and {q, r} are not outbound in {p, q, r} for \u03a02.\nLet us write a rule (12) in the following form:\na1; . . . ; ak \u2190 B,F . (49)\nGelfond et al. (1991) defined a mapping from a disjunctive program \u03a0 to a nondisjunctive program \u03a0sh , the shifted variant of \u03a0, by replacing each rule (49) with k > 1 in \u03a0 by k new rules:\nai \u2190 B,F, not a1 , . . . , not ai\u22121 , not ai+1 , . . . , not ak . (50)\nThey showed that every stable model of \u03a0sh is also a stable model of \u03a0. Although the converse does not hold in general, Ben-Eliyahu and Dechter (1994) showed that the converse holds if \u03a0 is HCF. We below extend this result to HEF programs.\nThe following proposition compares the elementary loops of \u03a0 with the elemen-\ntary loops of \u03a0sh .\nProposition 7 For any disjunctive program \u03a0, if X is an elementary loop of \u03a0, then X is an elementary loop of \u03a0sh .\nProof. Assume that X is an elementary loop of \u03a0. Then every nonempty proper subset Y of X is outbound in X for \u03a0, so that there is a rule (49) in \u03a0 such that\n{a1, . . . , ak} \u2229 Y 6= \u2205 , (51)\nB \u2229 (X \\ Y ) 6= \u2205 , (52)\n{a1, . . . , ak} \u2229 (X \\ Y ) = \u2205 ,\nand\nB \u2229 Y = \u2205 . (53)\nFor some ai \u2208 {a1, . . . , ak} \u2229 Y , (51) implies that some rule (50) in \u03a0sh satisfies\n{ai} \u2229 Y 6= \u2205\nand\n{ai} \u2229 (X \\ Y ) = \u2205 .\nTogether with (52) and (53), this means that Y is outbound in X for \u03a0sh . Consequently, X is an elementary loop of \u03a0sh .\nThe converse of Proposition 7 does not hold even if \u03a0 is HEF. For example,\nconsider the following HEF program \u03a03:\np ; q \u2190 r r \u2190 p r \u2190 q .\nSet {p, q, r} is not an elementary loop of \u03a03 since, for instance, {p} is not outbound in {p, q, r} for \u03a03. On the other hand, {p, q, r} is an elementary loop of (\u03a03)sh :\np \u2190 r, not q q \u2190 r, not p r \u2190 p r \u2190 q .\n(54)\nHowever, the following proposition shows that there is a certain subset of \u03a0sh whose elementary loops are also elementary loops of \u03a0.\nProposition 8 For any disjunctive program \u03a0, any set X of atoms, and any subset Y of X , if Y is an elementary loop of (\u03a0sh )X , then Y is an elementary loop of \u03a0.\nProof. Assume that Y is an elementary loop of (\u03a0sh )X , and not an elementary loop of \u03a0 for the sake of contradiction. Consider any rule (49) in \u03a0, and any proper subset Z of Y . Since Y is not an elementary loop of \u03a0, at least one of the following conditions holds:\n{a1, . . . , ak} \u2229 Z = \u2205 , {a1, . . . , ak} \u2229 (Y \\ Z) 6= \u2205 , B \u2229 Z 6= \u2205 , or B \u2229 (Y \\ Z) = \u2205 .\n(55)\nWe will show that any rule (50) in (\u03a0sh )X obtained from (49) by shifting satisfies\nat least one of the following conditions:\n{ai} \u2229 Z = \u2205 , {ai} \u2229 (Y \\ Z) 6= \u2205 , B \u2229 Z 6= \u2205 , or B \u2229 (Y \\ Z) = \u2205 .\nThis contradicts the assumption that Y is an elementary loop of (\u03a0sh )X .\nCase 1: The first, the third, or the fourth condition of (55) holds. The claim trivially follows.\nCase 2: {a1, . . . , ak} \u2229 (Y \\ Z) 6= \u2205. Recall that\nX |= B, F, not a1, . . . , not ai\u22121, not ai+1, not ak,\nby (\u03a0sh )X construction. It follows that |{a1, . . . , ak} \u2229X | \u2264 1. From the fact that Y \u2286 X and Z \u2282 Y we conclude that |{a1, . . . , ak}\u2229Y | \u2264 1 and {a1, . . . , ak}\u2229Z = \u2205, so that {ai} \u2229 Z = \u2205.\nFor instance, for X = {p, q, r} and (\u03a03)sh , we have that [(\u03a03)sh ]X consists of the last two rules in (54). Only the singletons {p}, {q}, and {r} are elementary loops of [(\u03a03)sh ]X , and clearly they are elementary loops of \u03a03 as well.\nWe are now ready to show the equivalence between an HEF program and its\nshifted variant.\nTheorem 5 For any HEF program \u03a0 and any set X of atoms, X is a stable model of \u03a0 iff X is a stable model of \u03a0sh .\nProof. From left to right: Assume that X is a stable model of \u03a0. Then X is a model of \u03a0sh such that all its atoms occur in \u03a0sh and also in [\u03a0sh ]X . Furthermore, by Theoremd 1 (d), we have that X satisfies LF\u03a0(Y ) for all elementary loops Y of \u03a0. By Proposition 8, the elementary loops of \u03a0 include all elementary loops Y of [\u03a0sh ]X that are contained in X , and, since \u03a0 is HEF, it holds that ES\u03a0sh (Y ) and ES\u03a0(Y ) as well as LF\u03a0sh (Y ) and LF\u03a0(Y ) are equivalent to each other. This implies that X satisfies ES\u03a0sh (Y ) for all elementary loops Y of [\u03a0sh ]X that are contained in X , so that X contains no elementarily unfounded sets for \u03a0sh w.r.t. X . By Theoremd 1 (e\u2032), we conclude that X is a stable model of \u03a0sh .\nFrom right to left: Assume that X is a stable model of \u03a0sh . Then X is a model of \u03a0 such that all its atoms occur in \u03a0. Furthermore, by Theoremd 1 (d), we have that X satisfies LF\u03a0sh (Y ) for all elementary loops Y of \u03a0sh . By Proposition 7, the elementary loops of \u03a0sh include all elementary loops Y of \u03a0, and, since \u03a0 is HEF, it holds that ES\u03a0(Y ) and ES\u03a0sh (Y ) as well as LF\u03a0(Y ) and LF\u03a0sh (Y ) are equivalent to each other. This implies that X satisfies LF\u03a0(Y ) for all elementary loops Y of \u03a0. By Theoremd 1 (d), we conclude that X is a stable model of \u03a0.\nFor instance, one can check that both \u03a02 and (\u03a02)sh have {p} and {q} as their stable models. It follows that HEF programs are not more expressive than nondisjunctive programs, so that one can regard the use of disjunctive rules in such programs as a syntactic variant. Furthermore, the problem of deciding whether a model is stable for an HEF program is tractable, just as the same problem for a nondisjunctive program. (In the case of arbitrary disjunctive programs, it is coNP-complete (Eiter and Gottlob 1995).) These properties were known for HCF programs, and here we extended them to HEF programs.\nIn Section 3.4, we defined the notion of an elementary subgraph of a set X of\natoms for a disjunctive program \u03a0. Theorem 3 still applies to HEF programs.\nTheoremhef 3 For any HEF program \u03a0 and any nonempty set X of atoms that occur in \u03a0, X is an elementary loop of \u03a0 iff the elementary subgraph of X for \u03a0 is strongly connected.\nProof. From left to right: Assume that X is an elementary loop of \u03a0, and, for the sake of contradiction, that the elementary subgraph of X for \u03a0 is not strongly\nconnected. Then there is a strongly connected component in (X,EC\u03a0(X)) whose atoms Y are not reached from any atom in X \\ Y . Clearly Y is a nonempty proper subset of X , and so is X \\ Y . Furthermore, for every rule (12) in \u03a0, at least one of the following conditions holds:\n|A \u2229X | > 1 , (56)\nA \u2229 (X \\ Y ) = \u2205 , (57)\nB \u2229 Y = \u2205 , (58)\nor\nB \u2229 (X \\ Y ) 6= \u2205 . (59)\nHowever, (56) contradicts the assumption that \u03a0 is HEF. Also the fact that at least one of the conditions (57), (58), and (59) holds contradicts the assumption that X \\ Y is outbound in X for \u03a0.\nFrom right to left: Assume that the elementary subgraph of X for \u03a0 is strongly connected. For every nonempty proper subset Y of X , there is a minimum integer i \u2265 0 such that EC i\u03a0(X) does not contain any edge from an atom in Y to an atom in X \\ Y , but EC i+1\u03a0 (X) contains such an edge. Thus some rule (12) in \u03a0 satisfies\n|A \u2229X | = 1 , (60)\nA \u2229 Y 6= \u2205 , (61)\nB \u2229 (X \\ Y ) 6= \u2205 ,\nand\nB \u2229 Y = \u2205 .\nFrom (60) and (61), since Y \u2286 X ,\nA \u2229 (X \\ Y ) = \u2205 .\nThis shows that Y is outbound in X for \u03a0. We conclude that X is an elementary loop of \u03a0.\nAlthough many properties of HCF programs still apply to HEF programs (e.g., equivalence between an HEF program and its shifted variant), the computational complexities of recognizing them are different. While an HCF program can be recognized in polynomial time (by computing the strongly connected components of its dependency graph), Fassetti and Palopoli (2010) showed that deciding whether a disjunctive program is HEF is coNP-complete.10 Theorem 4 established a similar complexity gap by showing that elementary loops are hard to verify in the case of arbitrary disjunctive programs, while for loops it remains a question of reachability.\n10 The problem was left open in (Gebser et al. 2007), one of our conference papers that this paper extends.\nSuch elevated complexities may appear daunting, but the semantic similarities between HEF and HCF programs still exhibit that the syntactic concept of reachability merely gives a rough approximation of properties rendering disjunctive programs more difficult than nondisjunctive ones. As noted in (Fassetti and Palopoli 2010), identifying subclasses of (not necessarily HCF) disjunctive programs for which verifying the HEF property is tractable may be an interesting line of future research."}, {"heading": "5 HEF Programs and Inherent Tightness", "text": "When we add more rules to a program, a stable model of the original program remains to be a stable model of the extended program if it satisfies the new rules.\nProposition 9\nFor any disjunctive program \u03a0 and any model X of \u03a0, X is a stable model of \u03a0 iff there is a subset \u03a0\u2032 of \u03a0 such that X is a stable model of \u03a0\u2032.\nProof. From left to right is clear.\nFrom right to left: Assume that X is not a stable model of \u03a0. Then some proper subset Y of X is a model of \u03a0X . For each subset \u03a0\u2032 of \u03a0, we have that (\u03a0\u2032)X \u2286 \u03a0X , so that Y is a model of (\u03a0\u2032)X and X is not a stable model of \u03a0\u2032.\nIn view of Theoremd 1, Proposition 9 tells us that, provided that X is a model of \u03a0, in order to verify that X is a stable model of \u03a0, it is sufficient to identify a subset \u03a0\u2032 of \u03a0 such that X is a stable model of \u03a0\u2032. Of course, one can trivially take \u03a0 itself as the subset \u03a0\u2032, but there are nontrivial subsets that deserve attention. In fact, if \u03a0 is nondisjunctive, it is known that the subset \u03a0\u2032 can be further restricted to a \u201ctight\u201d program (Fages 1994; Erdem and Lifschitz 2003)\u2014the result known as \u201cinherently tight\u201d (Lin and Zhao 2003) or \u201cweakly tight\u201d (You et al. 2003) program. In the following, we simplify these notions and show that they can be extended to HEF programs.\nRecall that a loop of \u03a0 is called trivial if it consists of a single atom such that the dependency graph of \u03a0 does not contain an edge from the atom to itself. In other words, a loop {a} of \u03a0 is trivial if there is no rule (12) in \u03a0 such that a \u2208 A \u2229B.\nDefinition 2 ((Lee 2005))\nA disjunctive program \u03a0 is called tight if every loop of \u03a0 is trivial.\nAs defined previously (Apt et al. 1988; Baral and Gelfond 1994; Inoue and Sakama 1998;\nLee 2005), we call a set X of atoms supported by a disjunctive program \u03a0 if, for every a \u2208 X , there is a rule (12) in \u03a0X such that A \u2229X = {a}. Note that Definition 2 and the notion of support also apply to nondisjunctive programs as a special case.\nThe property of inherent tightness, introduced by Lin and Zhao (2003) for the case of nondisjunctive programs, can now be reformulated and generalized as follows.\nDefinition 3 A disjunctive program \u03a0 is called inherently tight on a set X of atoms if there is a subset \u03a0\u2032 of \u03a0 such that \u03a0\u2032 is tight and X is supported by \u03a0\u2032.\nIn the case of nondisjunctive programs, this reformulation of inherent tightness is similar to \u201cwell-supportedness\u201d (Fages 1994). Furthermore, weak tightness, introduced in (You et al. 2003), is closely related to the notion of inherent tightness.\nFor nondisjunctive programs, it is known that their stable models can be char-\nacterized in terms of inherent tightness.\nProposition 10 ((Fages 1994; Lin and Zhao 2003; You et al. 2003)) For any nondisjunctive program \u03a0 and any model X of \u03a0, X is a stable model of \u03a0 iff \u03a0 is inherently tight on X .\nOne may wonder whether Proposition 10 can be extended to disjunctive programs as well, given that Definition 3 readily applies to them. However, only one direction of Proposition 10 holds in the case of arbitrary disjunctive programs.\nProposition 11 For any disjunctive program \u03a0 and any model X of \u03a0, if \u03a0 is inherently tight on X , then X is a stable model of \u03a0.\nProof. Assume that \u03a0 is inherently tight onX . Then there is a subset \u03a0\u2032 of \u03a0 such that \u03a0\u2032 is tight andX is supported by \u03a0\u2032. By Proposition 2 from (Lee and Lifschitz 2003), X is a stable model of \u03a0\u2032, and, by Proposition 9, X is a stable model of \u03a0.\nTo see that the converse of Proposition 11 does not hold, consider \u03a0 as follows:\np \u2190 q q \u2190 p p ; q \u2190 .\nSet {p, q} is a stable model of \u03a0. On the other hand, since any tight subset \u03a0\u2032 of \u03a0 must exclude the first or the second rule, it follows that {p, q} is not supported by \u03a0\u2032. But this means that \u03a0 is not inherently tight on {p, q}. It is also worthwhile to note that {p, q} is an elementary loop of \u03a0, so that \u03a0 is not HEF (and not HCF). Indeed, the following theorem tells us that Proposition 10 can be extended to HEF programs.\nTheorem 6 For any HEF program \u03a0 and any model X of \u03a0, X is a stable model of \u03a0 iff \u03a0 is inherently tight on X .\nProof. From left to right:Assume thatX is a stable model of \u03a0. By Propositiond 3 (and the fact that every atom of X occurs in \u03a0X), any nonempty subset Y of X contains some elementary loop Z of \u03a0X that is not outbound in Y for \u03a0X . 11 That is, every rule (12) of \u03a0X satisfies at least one of the following conditions:\nA \u2229 Z = \u2205 ,\n11 If Y is an elementary loop of \u03a0X , take Z = Y .\nB \u2229 (Y \\ Z) = \u2205 , (62)\nA \u2229 (Y \\ Z) 6= \u2205 , (63)\nor\nB \u2229 Z 6= \u2205 .\nFrom (63), since Y \u2286 X ,\nA \u2229 (X \\ Z) 6= \u2205 .\nOn the other hand, since X is a stable model of \u03a0 and Z is a nonempty subset of X , by Theoremd 1 (b), there is a rule (12) in \u03a0X such that\nA \u2229 Z 6= \u2205 , (64)\nA \u2229 (X \\ Z) = \u2205 , (65)\nand\nB \u2229 Z = \u2205 , (66)\nso that (62) must hold, which, in combination with (66), gives us that\nB \u2229 Y = \u2205 . (67)\nFurthermore, since \u03a0X \u2286 \u03a0, we have that Z is an elementary loop of \u03a0. Given that \u03a0 is HEF, from (64) and (65), we conclude that\nA \u2229X = {a} (68)\nfor some a \u2208 Z, where a \u2208 Y also holds because Z \u2286 Y . We have thus shown that, for any nonempty subset Y of X , there is a rule (12) in \u03a0X such that (67) and (68) for a \u2208 Y hold. Starting from X0 = \u2205 and \u03a00 = \u2205, when, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 |X |, we let\n\u2022 Y = (X \\X i\u22121), \u2022 \u03a0i is obtained from \u03a0i\u22121 by adding some rule (12) in \u03a0X such that (67) and\n(68) for a \u2208 Y hold, and\n\u2022 X i = X i\u22121 \u222a {a},\nthen X is supported by \u03a0\u2032 = \u03a0|X|. Furthermore, since a rule (12) in (\u03a0i \\ \u03a0i\u22121) satisfies A \u2229 X i\u22121 = \u2205 and B \u2286 X i\u22121 for every 1 \u2264 i \u2264 |X |, \u03a0\u2032 is tight by construction, which shows that \u03a0 is inherently tight on X .\nFrom right to left follows immediately from Proposition 11.\nSince every HCF program is HEF, Theorem 6 applies also to HCF programs. We demonstrated that, by turning to the notion of an elementary loop in place of a loop, we obtain generalizations of results known for loops, such as Theorem 5. This brings our attention to the following question. As a tight program can be characterized in terms of loops, can the notion of a tight program be generalized by referring to elementary loops instead? To answer it, let us first modify Definition 2 in the following way.\nDefinition 4 A disjunctive program \u03a0 is called e-tight if every elementary loop of \u03a0 is trivial.\nSince every elementary loop is a loop, it is clear that a tight program is e-tight as well. But is the class of e-tight programs more general than the class of tight programs? One reason why this is an interesting question to consider is because, if so, it would lead to a generalization of Fages\u2019 theorem (Fages 1994), which would yield a more general class of programs for which the stable model semantics coincides with the completion semantics. However, it turns out that e-tight programs are not more general than tight programs.\nProposition 12 For any disjunctive program \u03a0, \u03a0 is e-tight iff \u03a0 is tight.\nProof. From left to right: Assume that \u03a0 is not tight. Then there is a minimal nontrivial loop X of \u03a0, and the subgraph of the dependency graph of \u03a0 induced by X yields a simple directed cycle. That is, for any nonempty proper subset Y of X , there is a rule (12) in \u03a0 such that A\u2229X = {a}, B\u2229X = {b} for atoms a \u2208 Y , b \u2208 X \\ Y . This shows that Y is outbound in X for \u03a0, so that X is a nontrivial elementary loop of \u03a0.\nFrom right to left is clear.\nThis result also tells us that the notion of an inherently tight program does not become more general by referring to elementary loops, i.e., by replacing the part \u201c\u03a0\u2032 is tight\u201d in the statement of Definition 3 with \u201c\u03a0\u2032 is e-tight.\u201d"}, {"heading": "6 HEF Programs and Stability Checking", "text": "For a disjunctive program, the problem of deciding whether a given model is stable is coNP-complete (Eiter and Gottlob 1995). On the other hand, in view of Theorem 5, the same problem is tractable for HEF programs. In order to check the stability of a model in polynomial time, Leone et al. (1997) presented an operational framework, which, for HCF programs, allows for deciding whether a model is stable. Given a disjunctive program \u03a0 and sets X , Y of atoms, they defined a sequence R0\u03a0,X(Y ), R 1 \u03a0,X(Y ), . . . , which converges to a limit R \u03c9 \u03a0,X(Y ), in the following way:\n\u2022 R0\u03a0,X(Y ) = Y and \u2022 Ri+1\u03a0,X(Y ) is obtained by removing every atom a from R i \u03a0,X(Y ) such that some\nrule (12) in \u03a0X satisfies A \u2229 (X \u222a {a}) = {a} and B \u2229R i \u03a0,X(Y ) = \u2205. 12\nThe disjunctive rules considered in (Leone et al. 1997) do not admit double negations in rule bodies, but its (dis)use merely affects conditions like X |= B,F (or X 6|= B,F ) determining \u03a0X , while it is inconsequential otherwise. Hence, the following results remain valid for disjunctive programs whose rules are of the form (12).\n12 If Y is a subset of X, the condition \u201cA\u2229 (X \u222a{a}) = {a}\u201d can be replaced with \u201cA\u2229X = {a}\u201d without altering R\u03c9\n\u03a0,X (Y ).\nProposition 13 ((Leone et al. 1997, Lemma 6.4)) For any disjunctive program \u03a0 and any sets X , Y of atoms that occur in \u03a0, all subsets of Y that are unfounded by \u03a0 w.r.t. X are contained in R\u03c9\u03a0,X(Y ).\nProposition 14 ((Leone et al. 1997, Proposition 6.5)) For any disjunctive program\u03a0 and any setX of atoms that occur in \u03a0, ifR\u03c9\u03a0,X(X) = \u2205, then X contains no nonempty unfounded sets for \u03a0 w.r.t. X .\nProposition 15 ((Leone et al. 1997, Theorem 6.9)) For any HCF program \u03a0 and any set X of atoms that occur in \u03a0, X contains no nonempty unfounded sets for \u03a0 w.r.t. X iff R\u03c9\u03a0,X(X) = \u2205.\nFor a model X of \u03a0, in view of Theoremd 1 (b\u2032), Proposition 14 tells us that X is a stable model of \u03a0 if R\u03c9\u03a0,X(X) = \u2205. As stated in Proposition 15, the converse also holds if \u03a0 is HCF. We below extend this result to HEF programs.\nProposition 16 For any HEF program \u03a0, any set X of atoms, and any subset Y of X whose atoms occur in \u03a0, if R\u03c9\u03a0,X(Y ) 6= \u2205, then R \u03c9 \u03a0,X(Y ) contains an elementary loop Z of \u03a0 that is unfounded by \u03a0 w.r.t. X .\nProof. Assume that R\u03c9\u03a0,X(Y ) 6= \u2205. Then, for every rule (12) of \u03a0X , at least one of the following conditions holds:\n|A \u2229X | > 1 , (69)\nA \u2229R\u03c9\u03a0,X(Y ) = \u2205 , (70)\nor\nB \u2229R\u03c9\u03a0,X(Y ) 6= \u2205 . (71)\nBy Propositiond 3, R\u03c9\u03a0,X(Y ) contains some elementary loop Z of \u03a0 that is not outbound in R\u03c9\u03a0,X(Y ) for \u03a0. 13 For the sake of contradiction, assume that Z is not unfounded by \u03a0 w.r.t. X . Then there is a rule (12) in \u03a0X such that\nA \u2229 Z 6= \u2205 , (72)\nA \u2229 (X \\ Z) = \u2205 , (73)\nand\nB \u2229 Z = \u2205 . (74)\nFrom (73), since R\u03c9\u03a0,X(Y ) \u2286 X ,\nA \u2229 (R\u03c9\u03a0,X(Y ) \\ Z) = \u2205 ,\nwhich, in combination with (72), (74), and the fact that Z is not outbound in R\u03c9\u03a0,X(Y ) for \u03a0, gives us that\nB \u2229 (R\u03c9\u03a0,X(Y ) \\ Z) = \u2205 . (75)\n13 If R\u03c9 \u03a0,X (Y ) is an elementary loop of \u03a0, take Z = R\u03c9 \u03a0,X (Y ).\nFrom (74) and (75), we conclude that (71) does not hold. Furthermore, since Z \u2286 R\u03c9\u03a0,X(Y ), (72) implies that (70) does not hold. Hence, (69) must hold, which, in combination with (73), gives us that\n|A \u2229 Z| > 1 .\nBut since Z is an elementary loop of \u03a0, this contradicts that \u03a0 is HEF.\nWe are now ready to generalize Proposition 15 to HEF programs.\nTheorem 7 For any HEF program \u03a0 and any set X of atoms that occur in \u03a0, X contains no nonempty unfounded sets for \u03a0 w.r.t. X iff R\u03c9\u03a0,X(X) = \u2205.\nProof. From left to right follows immediately from Proposition 16.\nFrom right to left follows immediately from Proposition 14.\nRegarding the models of HEF programs, we derive the following corollary.\nCorollary 2 For any HEF program \u03a0 and any set X of atoms that occur in \u03a0, X is a stable model of \u03a0 iff X is a model of \u03a0 such that R\u03c9\u03a0,X(X) = \u2205.\nProof. Both directions follow immediately from Theoremd 1 (b\u2032) and Theorem 7.\nFor instance, reconsider \u03a02 from Section 4, which is HEF, but not HCF. Hence, Corollary 2 applies, but Proposition 15 does not apply. Indeed, since R\u03c9\u03a02,X(X) = X for (non-stable) model X = {p, q, r} of \u03a02, Corollary 2 allows us to conclude that X is not a stable model of \u03a02. On the other hand, for model {p} of \u03a02, we have that R\u03c9\u03a02,{p}({p}) = \u2205, which implies that {p} is a stable model of \u03a02.\nIn Section 3.3, we defined the notion of an elementarily unfounded set and showed that it coincides with a minimal nonempty unfounded set. Thus stability checking can be cast into the problem of ensuring the absence of elementarily unfounded sets. Since every elementarily unfounded set is a loop, it is clearly contained in a maximal loop, which allows us to modularize the consideration of (elementarily) unfounded sets. The idea of using maximal loops for partitioning a program and confining stability checking to subprograms was already exploited by Leone et al. (1997) and Koch et al. (2003). In fact, for a disjunctive program \u03a0 and a set X of atoms, Leone et al. (1997) showed how stability can be checked separately for maximal loops of \u03a0, and Koch et al. (2003) developed this idea further by considering maximal loops of the smaller program \u03a0X,R\u03c9 \u03a0,X (X). We below describe a notion called \u201cbounding loops,\u201d which go beyond such maximal loops.\nFor a disjunctive program \u03a0 and a set X of atoms, we say that a subset Y of X is a bounding loop of \u03a0 w.r.t. X if Y is maximal among all subsets Z of X such that Z is a loop of \u03a0X,Z and R \u03c9 \u03a0,X(Z) = Z. Note that there are two crucial differences between bounding loops and elementarily unfounded sets. First, a bounding loop Y of \u03a0 w.r.t. X is not necessarily an elementary loop of \u03a0X,Y . Next, it does not need to be unfounded by \u03a0 w.r.t. X . To see this, observe that X = {p, q, r} is a\nbounding loop of \u03a02 w.r.t. X that is not (elementarily) unfounded by \u03a02 w.r.t. X . Furthermore, one can check that {p, r} and {q, r} are (elementarily) unfounded by \u03a02 w.r.t. X , and thus Proposition d 5 tells us that X is not an elementary loop of (\u03a02)X,X .\nThe following two propositions describe properties of bounding loops that are similar to those of maximal loops, as used in (Leone et al. 1997; Koch et al. 2003).\nProposition 17 For any disjunctive program \u03a0 and any set X of atoms, all bounding loops of \u03a0 w.r.t. X are mutually disjoint.\nProof. Let Y1, Y2 be subsets of X such that Y1 is a loop of \u03a0X,Y1 , Y2 is a loop of \u03a0X,Y2 , R \u03c9 \u03a0,X(Y1) = Y1, and R \u03c9 \u03a0,X(Y2) = Y2. If Y1 \u2229 Y2 6= \u2205, the fact that \u03a0X,Y1 \u222a \u03a0X,Y2 \u2286 \u03a0X,Y1\u222aY2 implies that Y1 \u222a Y2 is a loop of \u03a0X,Y1\u222aY2 . Furthermore, since R\u03c9\u03a0,X(Y1) = Y1 and R \u03c9 \u03a0,X(Y2) = Y2, for any rule (12) of \u03a0X such that A \u2229 (Y1 \u222a Y2) 6= \u2205 and B \u2229 (Y1 \u222a Y2) = \u2205, we have that |A \u2229 X | > 1, from which we conclude that R\u03c9\u03a0,X(Y1 \u222a Y2) = Y1 \u222a Y2. Since bounding loops of \u03a0 w.r.t. X are maximal among all subsets Z of X such that Z is a loop of \u03a0X,Z and R \u03c9 \u03a0,X(Z) = Z, this shows that they must be mutually disjoint.\nProposition 18 For any disjunctive program \u03a0 and any set X of atoms that occur in \u03a0, every elementarily unfounded set for \u03a0 w.r.t. X is a singleton or contained in some bounding loop of \u03a0 w.r.t. X .\nProof. Assume that Y is an elementarily unfounded set for \u03a0 w.r.t. X that is not a singleton. From the definition of an elementarily unfounded set, it follows that Y is a loop of \u03a0X,Y and a subset of X . Since Y is also unfounded by \u03a0 w.r.t. X , by Proposition 13, we have that R\u03c9\u03a0,X(Y ) = Y . This shows that Y is contained in some maximal subset Z of X such that Z is a loop of \u03a0X,Z and R \u03c9 \u03a0,X(Z) = Z.\nProposition 17 and Proposition 18 tell us that checking the absence of elemen-\ntarily unfounded sets can be accomplished separately for bounding loops.\nProposition 19 For any disjunctive program \u03a0 and any model X of \u03a0, X is a stable model of \u03a0 iff\n\u2022 X is supported by \u03a0 and \u2022 no bounding loop of \u03a0 w.r.t. X contains a nonempty unfounded set for \u03a0\nw.r.t X .\nProof. From left to right follows immediately from Theoremd 1 (b\u2032) (and the fact that every atom of X occurs in \u03a0).\nFrom right to left: Assume that X is not a stable model of \u03a0 but supported by \u03a0. Then, by Theoremd 1 (e\u2032), X contains some elementarily unfounded set Y for \u03a0 w.r.t. X . If Y is not a singleton, by Proposition 18, Y is contained in some bounding loop of \u03a0 w.r.t. X . Otherwise, if Y is a singleton, the assumption that X is supported by \u03a0 implies that there is a rule (12) in \u03a0X,Y such that A \u2229X = Y , so\nthat Y is a loop of \u03a0X,Y . Since Y is unfounded by \u03a0 w.r.t. X , by Proposition 13, we also have that R\u03c9\u03a0,X(Y ) = Y . This shows that Y is contained in some maximal subset Z of X such that Z is a loop of \u03a0X,Z and R \u03c9 \u03a0,X(Z) = Z.\nAs it is easy to check that X is supported by \u03a0, Proposition 19 tells us that the investigation of bounding loops constitutes the hard part of stability checking. But this is not due to the hardness of identifying them. In fact, the following method can be used to compute all bounding loops Z of \u03a0 w.r.t. X in polynomial time:\n1. Let Y = X . 2. Let Z = R\u03c9\u03a0,X(Y ). (Note that Z = R \u03c9 \u03a0,X(Z).) 3. If Z is a loop of \u03a0X,Z , then mark Z as a bounding loop of \u03a0 w.r.t. X .\nOtherwise, proceed with Step 2 for every maximal loop Y of \u03a0X,Z that is contained in Z.\nThe soundness of this approach is straightforward, given that operator R is monotone, i.e., R\u03c9\u03a0,X(Z) \u2286 R \u03c9 \u03a0,X(Y ) if Z \u2286 Y (used in Step 2), and likewise that \u03a0X,Y \u2286 \u03a0X,Z if Y \u2286 Z (used in Step 3).\nFor illustration, consider the following program \u03a04:\np \u2190 r s \u2190 p p ; q \u2190 u q \u2190 r s \u2190 t s ; t \u2190 q r \u2190 p, q t \u2190 s, u r ; u \u2190 t u ; v \u2190 .\nFor X = {p, q, r, s, t, u}, it holds that (\u03a04)X,X = \u03a04 and also that X is a loop of \u03a04. However, Y = R \u03c9 \u03a04,X (X) = {p, q, r, s, t} 6= X , so that X is not a bounding loop of \u03a04 w.r.t. X . On the other hand, Y is not a loop of (\u03a04)X,Y , which does not include the last two rules where u occurs in the head. Rather, Z = {p, q, r} and Z \u2032 = {s, t} are the maximal loops of (\u03a04)X,Y that are contained in Y . In view of the rules in the second column, R\u03c9\u03a04,X(Z \u2032) = \u2205, which shows that no subset of Z \u2032 is a bounding loop of \u03a04 w.r.t. X . For Z = {p, q, r}, we obtain R\u03c9\u03a04,X(Z) = Z, and Z is also a loop of (\u03a04)X,Z (due to the rules in the first column). That is, Z is the single bounding loop of \u03a04 w.r.t. X .\nLet us compare this outcome with the ones of previous methods for modularizing stability checking. Since the approach described in (Leone et al. 1997) considers maximal loops of the original program and X = {p, q, r, s, t, u} is a (maximal) loop of \u03a04, it cannot be used to decompose X , and the only applicable simplification is to remove u by means of R, that is, Y = R\u03c9\u03a04,X(X) = {p, q, r, s, t}. The approach in (Koch et al. 2003) considers the maximal loops of \u03a0X,R\u03c9 \u03a0,X (X), which, for (\u03a04)X,Y , gives Z = {p, q, r} and Z \u2032 = {s, t}. As described in (Koch et al. 2003), since the subprograms (\u03a04)X,Z and (\u03a04)X,Z\u2032 are not HCF, they are not simplified any further and used to separately check for a nonempty unfounded subset of Z or Z \u2032, respectively. Unlike this, the notion of a bounding loop allowed us to eliminate all subsets of Z \u2032 as potential nonempty unfounded sets.\nTurning back to HEF programs, from Proposition 16, we derive the following proposition for a subprogram\u03a0X,Y associated with a bounding loop Y of \u03a0 w.r.t.X .\nProposition 20\nFor any disjunctive program \u03a0, any set X of atoms, and any bounding loop Y of \u03a0 w.r.t. X , if \u03a0X,Y is HEF, then Y contains a nonempty unfounded set for \u03a0 w.r.t. X .\nProof. Assume that \u03a0X,Y is HEF. From the definition of a bounding loop, it follows that all atoms of Y occur in \u03a0X,Y and that Y = R \u03c9 \u03a0,X(Y ) = R \u03c9 (\u03a0X,Y ),X (Y ) \u2286 X . By Proposition 16, we conclude that R\u03c9(\u03a0X,Y ),X(Y ) contains an elementary loop Z of \u03a0X,Y that is unfounded by \u03a0X,Y w.r.t. X . From the definition of \u03a0X,Y and since Z is contained in Y , we conclude that Z is also unfounded by \u03a0 w.r.t. X .\nProposition 20 tells us that the existence of a bounding loop Y of \u03a0 w.r.t. X whose associated subprogram \u03a0X,Y is HEF is already sufficient to conclude that X is not a stable model of \u03a0. Reconsidering the bounding loop Z = {p, q, r} of \u03a04 w.r.t. X = {p, q, r, s, t, u}, we have that (\u03a04)X,Z , consisting of the rules in the first column along with the disjunctive rule containing p and q in the head, is HEF (neither {p, q} nor {p, q, r} is an elementary loop of (\u03a04)X,Z). Thus X is not a stable model of \u03a04. Indeed, Z contains two (elementarily) unfounded sets for \u03a04 w.r.t. X : {p, r} and {q, r}."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "The notion of an elementary loop and its properties provide useful insights into the concept of a loop and the relationship between nondisjunctive programs and disjunctive programs. By turning to the notion of an elementary loop in place of a loop, we could strengthen the theorem by Lin and Zhao (2004), its generalization to disjunctive programs (Lee and Lifschitz 2003), and the main theorem (for programs in canonical form) from (Lee 2005). The semantic (e.g., Theoremd 2) and complexity-theoretic (e.g., Theorem 4) properties of elementary loops indicate their close relationship to unfounded sets. Compared with loops, elementary loops provide a deeper understanding of the internal structure of unfounded sets. In fact, we have shown that loop formulas of non-elementary loops are unnecessary for checking the stability of a model. It is an interesting open question whether this result can be used to improve computation performed by answer set solvers that calculate loop formulas, such as assat, claspd, and cmodels.\nA method to identify an elementarily unfounded set for an HEF program was presented in (Gebser et al. 2007).14 An orthogonal approach is implemented in claspd: it greedily adds atoms a to an unfounded set Y if Y \u222a{a} stays unfounded and has a shorter loop formula than Y . However, the potential of unfounded set \u201coptimization\u201d has not been studied in-depth so far, and the theoretical foundations laid here may be useful for future investigations in this direction. Regarding nondisjunctive programs, elementary loops can be distinct from loops of programs called \u201cbinary\u201d (Janhunen 2006). Moreover, modularity aspects of disjunctive stable models (Janhunen et al. 2009), which are closely related to loop formulas (Lemma 5.4 from (Janhunen et al. 2009)), can be refined by referring to elementary loops in\n14 It is omitted in this paper for brevity.\nplace of loops. Lifting elementary loops to first-order programs, as already done for loops (Chen et al. 2006; Lee and Meng 2008), may also be a direction to explore.\nThe notion of an HEF program is a strict generalization of the notion of an HCF program. On the one hand, nice properties of HCF programs still apply to HEF programs. In particular, their inherent tightness on stable models grants the soundness of shifting head atoms into the body as well as the possibility of performing stability checks in polynomial time. This however implies that a disjunctive program encoding an instance of a \u03a3P2 -hard problem is unlikely to be HEF. On the other hand, recognizing elementary loops and verifying the HEF property are both intractable in the case of arbitrary disjunctive programs, but tractable for nondisjunctive and HCF programs. This parallels the complexity of stability checking (Eiter and Gottlob 1995), and it also tells us that the inherent complexities of computational tasks dealing with elementary loops tightly correlate to the fragment of disjunctive programs under consideration. As the latter does not apply to recognizing loops or verifying the HCF property, the notion of an HEF program more precisely renders what makes arbitrary disjunctive programs more difficult than nondisjunctive programs. Whether this admits (syntactic) characterizations of yet unknown subclasses of disjunctive programs for which verifying the HEF property is tractable is an interesting open question."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We are grateful to Selim Erdog\u0306an, Tomi Janhunen, Dan Lessin, Vladimir Lifschitz, Torsten Schaub, Jicheng Zhao, and the anonymous referees of (Gebser et al. 2006; Gebser et al. 2007) and this paper for their useful comments.
