Previous studies on efficient empirical loss minimization assume either a smooth loss function or a strongly convex regularizer, making them unsuitable for non-smooth optimization. We develop a simple yet efficient method for a family of non-smooth optimization problems where the dual form of the loss function is bilinear in primal and dual variables. We cast a non-smooth optimization problem into a minimax optimization problem, and develop a primal dual prox method that solves the minimax optimization problem at a rate of O(1/T ) assuming that the proximal step can be efficiently solved, significantly faster than a standard subgradient descent method that has an O(1/ \u221a T ) convergence rate. Our empirical study verifies the efficiency of the proposed method for various non-smooth optimization problems that arise ubiquitously in machine learning by comparing it to the state-of-the-art first order methods.\nKeywords: non-smooth optimization, primal dual method, convergence rate, sparsity, efficiency"}, {"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "Formulating machine learning tasks as a regularized empirical loss minimization problem makes an intimate connection between machine learning and mathematical optimization. In regularized empirical loss minimization, one tries to jointly minimize an empirical loss over training samples plus a regularization term of the model. This formulation includes support vector machine (SVM) (Hastie et al., 2008), support vector regression (Smola and Scho\u0308lkopf, 2004), Lasso (Zhu et al., 2003), logistic regression, and ridge regression (Hastie et al., 2008) among many others. Therefore, optimization methods play a central role in solving machine learning problems and challenges exist in machine learning applications demand the development of new optimization algorithms.\nDepending on the application at hand, various types of loss and regularization functions have been introduced in the literature. The efficiency of different optimization algorithms crucially depends on the specific structures of the loss and the regularization functions. Recently, there have been significant interests on gradient descent based meth-\nc\u00a9 Yang et al.\nods due to their simplicity and scalability to large datasets. A well-known example is the Pegasos algorithm (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2011) which minimizes the \u211322 regularized hinge loss (i.e., SVM) and achieves a convergence rate of O(1/T ), where T is the number of iterations, by exploiting the strong convexity of the regularizer. Several other first order algorithms (Ji and Ye, 2009; Chen et al., 2009) are also proposed for smooth loss functions (e.g., squared loss and logistic loss) and non-smooth regularizers (i.e., \u21131,\u221e and group lasso). They achieve a convergence rate of O(1/T 2) by exploiting the smoothness of the loss functions.\nIn this paper, we focus on a more challenging case where both the loss function and the regularizer are non-smooth, to which we refer as non-smooth optimization. Non-smooth optimization of regularized empirical loss has found applications in many machine learning problems. Examples of non-smooth loss functions include hinge loss (Vapnik, 1998), generalized hinge loss (Bartlett and Wegkamp, 2008), absolute loss (Hastie et al., 2008), and \u01eb-insensitive loss (Rosasco et al., 2004); examples of non-smooth regularizers include lasso (Zhu et al., 2003), group lasso (Yuan and Lin, 2006), sparse group lasso (Yang et al., 2010), exclusive lasso (Zhou et al., 2010b), \u21131,\u221e regularizer (Quattoni et al., 2009), and trace norm regularizer (Rennie and Srebro, 2005).\nAlthough there are already many existing studies on tackling smooth loss functions (e.g., square loss for regression, logistic loss for classification), or smooth regularizers (e.g., \u211322 norm), there are serious challenges in developing efficient algorithms for non-smooth optimization. In particular, common tricks, such as smoothing non-smooth objective functions (Nesterov, 2005a,b), can not be applied to non-smooth optimization to improve convergence rate. This is because they require both the loss functions and regularizers be written in the maximization form of bilinear functions, which unfortunately are often violated, as we will discuss later. In this work, we focus on optimization problems in machine learning where both the loss function and the regularizer are non-smooth. Our goal is to develop an efficient gradient based algorithm that has a convergence rate of O(1/T ) for a wide family of non-smooth loss functions and general non-smooth regularizers.\nIt is noticeable that according to the information based complexity theory (Traub et al., 1988), it is impossible to derive an efficient first order algorithm that generally works for all non-smooth objective functions. As a result, we focus on a family of non-smooth optimization problems, where the dual form of the non-smooth loss function is bilinear in both primal and dual variables. Additionally, we show that many non-smooth loss functions have this bilinear dual form. We derive an efficient gradient based method, with a convergence rate of O(1/T ), that explicitly updates both the primal and dual variables. The proposed method is referred to as Primal Dual Prox (Pdprox) method. Besides its capability of dealing with non-smooth optimization, the proposed method is effective in handling the learning problems where additional constraints are introduced for dual variables.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related work on minimizing regularized empirical loss especially the first order methods for large-scale optimization. Section 3 presents some notations and definitions. Section 4 presents the proposed primal dual prox method, its convergence analysis, and several extensions of the proposed method. Section 5 presents the empirical studies, and Section 6 concludes this work."}, {"heading": "2. Related Work", "text": "Our work is closely related to the previous studies on regularized empirical loss minimization. In the following discussion, we mostly focus on non-smooth loss functions and non-smooth regularizers.\nNon-smooth loss functions Hinge loss is probably the most commonly used nonsmooth loss function for classification. It is closely related to the max-margin criterion. A number of algorithms have been proposed to minimize the \u211322 regularized hinge loss (Platt, 1998; Joachims, 1999, 2006; Hsieh et al., 2008; Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2011), and the \u21131 regularized hinge loss (Cai et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2003; Fung and Mangasarian, 2002). Besides the hinge loss, recently a generalized hinge loss function (Bartlett and Wegkamp, 2008) has been proposed for cost sensitive learning. For regression, square loss is commonly used due to its smoothness. However, non-smooth loss functions such as absolute loss (Hastie et al., 2008) and \u01eb-insensitive loss (Rosasco et al., 2004) are useful for robust regression. The Bayes optimal predictor of square loss is the mean of the predictive distribution, while the Bayes optimal predictor of absolute loss is the median of the predictive distribution. Therefore absolute loss is more robust for long-tailed error distributions and outliers (Hastie et al., 2008). (Rosasco et al., 2004) also proved that the estimation error bound for absolute loss and \u01eb-insensitive loss converges faster than that of square loss. Non-smooth piecewise linear loss function has been used in quantile regression (Koenker, 2005; Gneiting, 2008). Unlike the absolute loss, the piecewise linear loss function can model non-symmetric error in reality.\nNon-smooth regularizers Besides the simple non-smooth regularizers such as \u21131, \u21132, and \u2113\u221e norms (Duchi and Singer, 2009), many other non-smooth regularizers have been employed in machine learning tasks. (Yuan and Lin, 2006) introduced group lasso for selecting important explanatory factors in group manner. The \u21131,\u221e norm regularizer has been used for multi-task learning (Argyriou et al., 2008). In addition, several recent works (Hou et al., 2011; Nie et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2009) considered mixed \u21132,1 regularizer for feature selection. (Zhou et al., 2010b) introduced exclusive lasso for multitask feature selection to model the scenario where variables within a single group compete with each other. Trace norm regularizer is another non-smooth regularizer, which has found applications in matrix completion (Recht et al., 2010; Cande\u0300s and Recht, 2008), matrix factorization (Rennie and Srebro, 2005; Srebro et al., 2005), and multi-task learning (Argyriou et al., 2008; Ji and Ye, 2009). The optimization algorithms presented in these works are usually limited: either the convergence rate is not guaranteed (Argyriou et al., 2008; Recht et al., 2010; Hou et al., 2011; Nie et al., 2010; Rennie and Srebro, 2005; Srebro et al., 2005) or the loss functions are assumed to be smooth (e.g., the square loss or the logistic loss) (Liu et al., 2009; Ji and Ye, 2009). Despite the significant efforts in developing algorithms for minimizing regularized empirical losses, it remains a challenge to design a first order algorithm that is able to efficiently solve non-smooth optimization problems at a rate of O(1/T ) when both the loss function and the regularizer are non-smooth.\nGradient based optimization Our work is closely related to (sub)gradient based optimization methods. The convergence rate of gradient based methods usually depends on the properties of the objective function to be optimized. When the objective function is strongly convex and smooth, it is well known that gradient descent methods can achieve a geometric convergence rate (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004). When the objective function is smooth but not strongly convex, the optimal convergence rate of a gradient descent method is O(1/T 2), and is achieved by the Nesterov\u2019s methods (Nesterov, 2007). For the objective function which is strongly convex but not smooth, the convergence rate becomes O(1/T ) (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2011). For general non-smooth objective functions, the optimal rate of any first order method is O(1/ \u221a T ). Although it is not improvable in general, recent studies are able to improve this rate to O(1/T ) by exploring the special structure of the objective function (Nesterov, 2005a,b). In addition, several methods are developed for composite optimization, where the objective function is written as a sum of a smooth and a non-smooth function (Lan, 2010; Nesterov, 2007; Lin, 2010). Recently,\nthese optimization techniques have been successfully applied to various machine learning problems, such as SVM (Zhou et al., 2010a), general regularized empirical loss minimization (Duchi and Singer, 2009; Hu et al., 2009), trace norm minimization (Ji and Ye, 2009), and multi-task sparse learning (Chen et al., 2009). Despite these efforts, one major limitation of the existing (sub)gradient based algorithms is that in order to achieve a convergence rate better than O(1/ \u221a T ), they have to assume that the loss function is smooth or the regularizer is strongly convex, making them unsuitable for non-smooth optimization.\nConvex-concave optimization The present work is also related to convex-concave minimization. Tseng (2008) and Nemirovski (2005) developed prox methods that have a convergence rate of O(1/T ), provided the gradients are Lipschitz continuous and have been applied to machine learning problems (Sun et al., 2009). In contrast, our method achieves a rate of O(1/T ) without requiring the whole gradient but part of the gradient to be Lipschitz continuous. Several other primal-dual algorithms have been developed for regularized empirical loss minimization that update both primal and dual variables. (Zhu and Chan, 2008) proposed a primal-dual method based on gradient descent, which only achieves a rate of O(1/ \u221a T ). It was generalized in (Esser et al., 2010), which shares the similar spirit of the proposed algorithm. However, the explicit convergence rate was not established even though the convergence is proved. (Mosci et al., 2010) presented a primal-dual algorithm for group sparse regularization, which updates the primal variable by a prox method and the dual variable by a Newton\u2019s method. In contrast, the proposed algorithm is a first order method that does not require computing the Hessian matrix as the Newton\u2019s method does, and is therefore more scalable to large datasets. (Combettes and Pesquet; Radu loan Bot, 2012) proposed primal-dual splitting algorithms for finding zeros of maximal monotone operators of special types. (Lan et al., 2011) considered the primal-dual convex formulations for general cone programming and apply Nesterov\u2019s optimal first order method (Nesterov, 2007), Nesterov\u2019s smoothing technique (Nesterov, 2005a), and Nemirovski\u2019s prox method (Nemirovski, 2005). Nesterov (2005b) proposed a primal dual gradient method for a special class of structured non-smooth optimization problems by exploring an excessive gap technique.\nOptimizing non-smooth functions We note that Nesterov\u2019s smoothing technique (Nesterov, 2005a) and excessive gap technique (Nesterov, 2005b) can be applied to nonsmooth optimization and both achieve O(1/T ) convergence rate for a special class of nonsmooth optimization problems. However, the limitation of these approaches is that they require all the non-smooth terms (i.e., the loss and the regularizer) to be written as an explicit max structure that consists of a bilinear function in primal and dual variables, thus limits their applications to many machine learning problems. In addition, Nesterov\u2019s algorithms need to solve additional maximizations problem at each iteration. In contrast, the proposed algorithm only requires mild condition on the non-smooth loss functions (section 4), and allows for any commonly used non-smooth regularizers, without having to solve an additional optimization problem at each iteration. Compared to Nesterov\u2019s algorithms, the proposed algorithm is applicable to a large class of non-smooth optimization problems, is easier to implement, its convergence analysis is much simpler, and its empirical performance is usually comparably favorable. Finally we noticed that, as we are preparing our manuscript, a related work (Chambolle and Pock, 2011) has recently been published in the Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision that shares a similar idea as this work. Both works maintain and update the primal and dual variables for solving a non-smooth optimization problem, and achieve the same convergence rate (i.e., O(1/T )). However, our work distinguishes from (Chambolle and Pock, 2011) in following aspects: (i) We propose and analyze two primal dual prox methods: one gives an extra gradient updating to dual variables and the other gives an extra gradient updating to primal vari-\nables. Depending on the nature of applications, one method may be more efficient than the others; (ii) In Section 4.4, we discuss how to efficiently solve the interim projection problems for updating both primal variable and dual variable, a critical issue for making the proposed algorithm practically efficient. In contrast, (Chambolle and Pock, 2011) simply assumes that the interim projection problems can be solved efficiently; (iii) We focus our analysis and empirical studies on the optimization problems that are closely related to machine learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on various classification, regression, and matrix completion tasks with non-smooth loss functions and non-smooth regularizers; (iv) We also conduct analysis and experiments on the convergence of the proposed methods when dealing with the \u21131 constraint on the dual variable, an approach that is commonly used in robust optimization, and observe that the proposed methods converge much faster when the bound of the \u21131 constraint is small and the obtained solution is more robust in terms of prediction in the presence of noise in labels. In contrast, the study (Chambolle and Pock, 2011) only considers the application in image problems.\nWe also note that the proposed algorithm is closely related to proximal point algorithm (Rockafellar, 1976) as shown in (He and Yuan, 2012), and many variants including the modified Arrow-Hurwicz method (Popov, 1980), the Doughlas-Rachford (DR) splitting algorithm (Lions and Mercier, 1979), the alternating method of multipliers (ADMM) (Boyd et al., 2011), the forward-backward splitting algorithm (Bredies, 2009), the FISTA algorithm (Beck and Teboulle, 2009). For a detailed comparison with some of these algorithms, one can refer to (Chambolle and Pock, 2011)."}, {"heading": "3.

The difference between logistic loss and hinge loss, square loss and absolute loss can be seen in Figure 1.

Proofs for technical lemmas are deferred to the appendix."}, {"heading": "4.1 Non-Smooth Optimization", "text": "We first focus our analysis on linear classifiers and denote by w \u2208 Rd a linear model. The extension to nonlinear models is discussed in section 4.5. Also, extension to a collection of linear models W \u2208 Rd\u00d7K can be done in a straightforward way. We consider the following general non-smooth optimization problem:\nmin w\u2208Qw\n[ L(w) = max\n\u03b1\u2208Q\u03b1 L(w,\u03b1;X,y) + \u03bbR(w)\n] . (2)\nThe parameters w in domain Qw and \u03b1 in domain Q\u03b1 are referred to as primal and dual variables, respectively. Since it is impossible to develop an efficient first order method for general non-smooth optimization, we focus on the family of non-smooth loss functions that can be characterized by bilinear function L(w,\u03b1;X,y), i.e.\nL(w,\u03b1;X,y) = c0(X,y) +\u03b1 \u22a4a(X,y) +w\u22a4b(X,y) +w\u22a4H(X,y)\u03b1, (3)\nwhere c0(X,y), a(X,y), b(X,y), and H(X,y) are the parameters depending on the training examples (X,y) with consistent sizes.

We will explicitly exploit this property in developing the efficient optimization algorithms. We also note that no explicit assumption is made for the regularizer R(w). This is in contrast to the smoothing techniques used in (Nesterov, 2005a,b).\nTo efficiently solve the optimization problem in (1), we need first turn it into the form (2).

Besides the non-smooth loss function \u2113(w;x, y), we also assume that the regularizer R(w) is a non-smooth function. Many non-smooth regularizers are used in machine learning problems. We list a few of them in the following, where W = (w1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,wK), wk \u2208 Rd and wj is the jth row of W.\n\u2022 lasso: R(w) = \u2016w\u20161, \u21132 norm: R(w) = \u2016w\u20162, and \u2113\u221e norm: R(w) = \u2016w\u2016\u221e. \u2022 group lasso: R(w) = \u2211Kg=1 \u221a dg\u2016wg\u20162, where wg \u2208 Rdg . \u2022 exclusive lasso: R(W) = \u2211dj=1 \u2016wj\u201621. \u2022 \u21132,1 norm: R(W) = \u2211d j=1 \u2016wj\u20162. \u2022 \u21131,\u221e norm: R(W) = \u2211d\nj=1 \u2016wj\u2016\u221e. \u2022 trace norm: R(W) = \u2016W\u20161, the summation of singular values of W. \u2022 other regularizers: R(W) = (\u2211K k=1 \u2016wk\u20162 )2 .\nNote that unlike (Nesterov, 2005a,b), we do not further require the non-smooth regularizer to be written into a bilinear dual form, which could be violated by many non-smooth regularizers, e.g. R(W) = (\u2211K k=1 \u2016wk\u20162 )2\nor more generally R(w) = V (\u2016w\u2016), where V (z) is a monotonically increasing function.\nWe close this section by presenting a lemma showing an important property of the bilinear function L(w,\u03b1).\nLemma 3 Let L(w,\u03b1) be bilinear in w and \u03b1 as in (3). Given fixed X,y there exists c > 0 such that \u2016H(X,y)\u201622 \u2264 c, then for any \u03b11,\u03b12 \u2208 Q\u03b1, and w1,w2 \u2208 Qw we have\n\u2016G\u03b1(w1,\u03b11)\u2212G\u03b1(w2,\u03b12)\u201622 \u2264 c\u2016w1 \u2212w2\u201622, (6) \u2016Gw(w1,\u03b11)\u2212Gw(w2,\u03b12)\u201622 \u2264 c\u2016\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12\u201622. (7)\nRemark 2 The value of constant c in Lemma 3 is an input to our algorithms used to set the step size. In the Appendix A, we show how to estimate constant c for certain loss functions. In addition the constant c in bounds (6) and (7) do not have to be the same as shown by the the example of generalized hinge loss in Appendix A. It should be noticed that the inequalities in Lemma 3 indicate L(w,\u03b1) has Liptschitz continuos gradients, however, the gradient of the whole objective with respect to w, i.e., Gw(w,\u03b1) + \u03bb\u2202R(w) is not Lipschitz continuous due to the general non-smooth term R(w), which prevents previous convex-concave minimization scheme (Tseng, 2008; Nemirovski, 2005) not applicable."}, {"heading": "4.2 The Proposed Primal-Dual Prox Methods", "text": "In this subsection, we present two variants of Primal Dual Prox (Pdprox) method for solving the non-smooth optimization problem in (2). The common feature shared by the two algorithms is that they update both the primal and the dual variables at each iteration. In contrast, most first order methods only update the primal variables. The key advantages of the proposed algorithms is that they are able to capture the sparsity structures of\nAlgorithm 1 The Pdprox-dual Algorithm for Non-Smooth Optimization\n1: Input: step size \u03b3 = \u221a\n1/(2c), where c is specified in (6). 2: Initialization: w0 = 0,\u03b20 = 0 3: for t = 1, 2, . . . do 4: \u03b1t = \u03a0Q\u03b1 [ \u03b2t\u22121 + \u03b3G\u03b1(wt\u22121,\u03b2t\u22121) ] 5: wt = argminw\u2208Qw 1 2 \u2016w \u2212 (wt\u22121 \u2212 \u03b3Gw(wt\u22121,\u03b1t))\u2016 2 2 + \u03b3\u03bbR(w)\n6: \u03b2t = \u03a0Q\u03b1 [ \u03b2t\u22121 + \u03b3G\u03b1(wt,\u03b1t) ] 7: end for 8: Output w\u0302T = \u2211T t=1 wt/T and \u03b1\u0302T = \u2211T t=1 \u03b1t/T .\nboth primal and dual variables, which is usually the case when both the regularizer and the loss functions are both non-smooth. The two algorithms differ from each other in the number of copies for the dual or the primal variables, and the specific order for updating those. Although our analysis shows that the two algorithms share the same convergence rate; however, our empirical studies show that the one algorithm is more preferable than the other depending on the nature of the applications.\nPdprox-dual algorithm Algorithm 1 shows the first primal dual prox algorithm for optimizing the problem in (2). Compared to the other gradient based algorithms, Algorithm 1 has several interesting features:\n(i) it updates both the dual variable \u03b1 and the primal variable w. This is useful when additional constraints are introduced for the dual variables, as we will discuss later.\n(ii) it introduces an extra dual variable \u03b2 in addition to \u03b1, and updates both \u03b1 and \u03b2 at each iteration by a gradient mapping. The gradient mapping on the dual variables into a sparse domain allows the proposed algorithm to capture the sparsity of the dual variables (more discussion on how the sparse constraint on the dual variable affects the convergence is presented in Section 4.5). Compared to the second algorithm presented below, we refer to Algorithm 1 as Pdprox-dual algorithm since it introduces an extra dual variable in updating.\n(iii) the primal variable w is updated by a composite gradient mapping (Nesterov, 2007) in step 5. Solving a composite gradient mapping in this step allows the proposed algorithm to capture the sparsity of the primal variable. Similar to many other approaches for composite optimization (Duchi and Singer, 2009; Hu et al., 2009), we assume that the mapping in step 5 can be solved efficiently. (This is the only assumption we made on the non-smooth regularizer. The discussion in Section 4.4 shows that the proposed algorithm can be applied to a large family of non-smooth regularizers). (iv) the step size \u03b3 is fixed to \u221a 1/(2c), where c is the constant specified in Lemma 3. This is in\ncontrast to most gradient based methods where the step size depends on T and/or \u03bb. This feature is particularly useful in implementation as we often observe that the performance of a gradient method is sensitive to the choice of the step size.\nPdprox-primal algorithm In Algorithm 1, we maintain two copies of the dual variables \u03b1 and \u03b2, and update them by two gradient mappings 1. We can actually save one gradient mapping on the dual variable by first updating the primal variable wt, and then updating \u03b1t using partial gradient computed with wt. As a tradeoff, we add an extra primal variable u, and update it by a simple calculation. The detailed steps are shown\n1. The extra gradient mapping on \u03b2 can also be replaced with a simple calculation, as discussed in subsection 4.4.\nAlgorithm 2 The Pdprox-primal Algorithm for Non-Smooth Optimization\n1: Input: step size \u03b3 = \u221a\n1/(2c), where c is specified in (7). 2: Initialization: u0 = 0,\u03b10 = 0 3: for t = 1, 2, . . . do 4: wt = argminw\u2208Qw 1 2 \u2016w \u2212 (ut\u22121 \u2212 \u03b3Gw(ut\u22121,\u03b1t\u22121))\u2016 2 2 + \u03b3\u03bbR(w) 5: \u03b1t = \u03a0Q\u03b1 [\u03b1t\u22121 + \u03b3G\u03b1(wt,\u03b1t\u22121)] 6: ut = wt + \u03b3(Gw(ut\u22121,\u03b1t\u22121)\u2212Gw(wt,\u03b1t)) 7: end for 8: Output w\u0302T = \u2211T t=1 wt/T and \u03b1\u0302T = \u2211T t=1 \u03b1t/T .\nin Algorithm 2. Similar to Algorithm 1, Algorithm 2 also needs to compute two partial gradients (except for the initial partial gradient on the primal variable), i.e., Gw(\u00b7,\u03b1t) and G\u03b1(wt, \u00b7). Different from Algorithm 1, Algorithm 2 (i) maintains (wt,\u03b1t,ut) at each iteration with O(2d + n) memory, while Algorithm 1 maintains (\u03b1t,wt,\u03b2t) at each iteration with O(2n+ d) memory; (ii) and replaces one gradient mapping on an extra dual variable \u03b2t with a simple update on an extra primal variable ut. Depending on the nature of applications, one method may be more efficient than the other. For example, if the dimension d is much larger than the number of examples n, then Algorithm 1 would be more preferable than Algorithm 2. When the number of examples n is much larger than the dimension d, Algorithm 2 could save the memory and the computational cost. However, as shown by our analysis in Section 4.3, the convergence rate of two algorithms are the same. Because it introduces an extra primal variable, we refer to Algorithm 2 as the Pdprox-primal algorithm.\nRemark 4 It should be noted that although Algorithm 1 uses a similar strategy for updating the dual variables \u03b1 and \u03b2, but it is significantly different from the mirror prox method (Nemirovski, 2005). First, unlike the mirror prox method that introduces an auxiliary variable for w, Algorithm 1 introduces a composite gradient mapping for updating w. Second, Algorithm 1 updates wt using the partial gradient computed from the updated dual variable \u03b1t rather than \u03b2t\u22121. Third, Algorithm 1 does not assume that the overall objective function has Lipschitz continuous gradients, a key assumption that limits the application of the mirror prox method.\nRemark 5 A similar algorithm with an extra primal variable is also proposed in a recent work (Chambolle and Pock, 2011). It is slightly different from Algorithm 2 in the order of updating on the primal variable and the dual variable, and the gradients used in the updating. We discuss the differences between the Pdprox method and the algorithm in (Chambolle and Pock, 2011) with our notations in Appendix C."}, {"heading": "4.3 Convergence Analysis", "text": "This section establishes bounds on the convergence rate of the proposed algorithms.

Although in this case both algorithms achieve a convergence rate of O(1/T ), their dependence on the regularization parameter \u03bb is very different. In particular, the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is O (\n(1+n\u03bb)R\u221a 2n\u03bbT\n) by noting that\n\u2016w\u2217\u201622 = O(1/\u03bb), \u2016\u03b1\u2217\u201622 \u2264 \u2016\u03b1\u2217\u20161 \u2264 n, and c = R2/n, while the Pegasos algorithm has a convergence rate of O\u0303 ( ( \u221a \u03bb+R)2\n\u03bbT\n) , where O\u0303(\u00b7) suppresses a logarithmic term ln(T ). Accord-\ning to the common assumption of learning theory (Wu and Zhou, 2005; Smale and Zhou, 2003), the optimal \u03bb is O(n\u22121/(\u03c4+1)) if the probability measure can be approximated by the closure of RKHS H\u03ba with exponent 0 < \u03c4 \u2264 1. As a result, the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is O( \u221a nR/T ) while the convergence rate of Pegasos is O(n1/(1+\u03c4)R2/T ). Since \u03c4 \u2208 (0, 1], the proposed algorithm could be more efficient than the Pegasos algorithm, particularly when \u03bb is sufficiently small. This is verified by our empirical studies in section 5.7 (see Figure 8). It is also interesting to note that the convergence rate of Pdprox\n2. We compare to the deterministic Pegasos that computes the gradient using all examples at each iteration. It would be criticized that it is not fair to compare with Pegasos since it is a stochastic algorithm, however, such a comparison (both theoretically and empirically) would provide a formal evidence that solving the min-max problem by a primal dual method with an extra-gradient may yield better convergence than solving the primal problem.\nhas a better dependence on R, the \u21132 norm bound of examples \u2016x\u20162 \u2264 R, compared to R2 in the convergence rate of Pegasos. Finally, we mention that the proposed algorithm is a deterministic algorithm that requires a full pass of all training examples at each iteration, while Pegasos can be purely stochastic by sampling one example for computing the sub-gradient, which maintains the same convergence rate. It remains an interesting and open problem to extend the Pdprox algorithm to its stochastic or randomized version with a similar convergence rate."}, {"heading": "4.4 Implementation Issues", "text": "In this subsection, we discuss some implementation issues: (1) how to efficiently solve the optimization problems for updating the primal and dual variables in Algorithms 1 and 2; (2) how to set a good step size; and (3) how to implement the algorithms efficiently.\nBoth \u03b1 and \u03b2 are updated by a gradient mapping that requires computing the projection into the domain Q\u03b1. When Q\u03b1 is only consisted of box constraints (e.g., hinge loss, absolute loss, and \u01eb-insensitive loss), the projection\n\u220f Q\u03b1 [\u03b1\u0302] can be computed by threshold-\ning.

(Duchi et al., 2008) has proposed more efficient algorithms for solving the projection problem.\nMoreover, we can further improve the efficiency of Algorithm 1 by removing the gradient mapping on \u03b2. The key idea is similar to the analysis provided in subsection 4.5 for arguing that the convergence rate presented in Theorem 6 for Algorithm 2 holds for any convex domain Qw.

To prove the convergence rate of Algorithm 3, we can follow the same analysis to first prove the duality gap for L(w,\u03b1) + \u03bbR(w) \u2212 Q(\u03b1) and then absorb Q(\u03b1) into the domain constraint of \u03b1. The convergence result presented in Theorem 6 holds the same for Algorithm 3.\nRemark 15 In Appendix C, we show that the updates on (wt,\u03b1t) of Algorithm 3 are essentially the same to the Algorithm 1 in (Chambolle and Pock, 2011), if we remove the extra dual variable in Algorithm 3 and the extra primal variable in Algorithm 1 in (Chambolle and Pock, 2011). However, the difference is that in Algorithm 3, we maintain two dual variables and one primal variable at each iteration, while the Algorithm 1 in (Chambolle and Pock, 2011) maintains two primal variables and one dual variable at each iteration.\nFor the composite gradient mapping for w \u2208 Qw = Rd, there is a closed form solution for simple regularizers (e.g., \u21131, \u21132) and decomposable regularizers (e.g., \u21131,2). Efficient algorithms are available for composite gradient mapping when the regularizer is the \u2113\u221e and \u21131,\u221e, or trace norm. More details can be found in (Duchi and Singer, 2009; Ji and Ye, 2009). Here we present an efficient solution to a general regularizer V (\u2016w\u2016), where \u2016w\u2016 is either a simple regularizer (e.g., \u21131, \u21132, and \u2113\u221e) or a decomposable regularizer (e.g., \u21131,2 and \u21131,\u221e), and V (z) is convex and monotonically increasing for z \u2265 0. An example is V (\u2016w\u2016) = ( \u2211 k \u2016wk\u20162)2, where w1, . . . ,wK forms a partition of w.\nLemma 16 Let V\u2217(\u03b7) be the convex conjugate of V (z), i.e. V (z) = max\u03b7 \u03b7z \u2212 V\u2217(\u03b7). Then the solution to the composite mapping\nw\u2217 = arg min w\u2208Qw\n1 2 \u2016w\u2212 w\u0302\u201622 + \u03bbV (\u2016w\u2016),\ncan be computed by\nw\u2217 = arg min w\u2208Qw\n1 2 \u2016w\u2212 w\u0302\u201622 + \u03bb\u03b7\u2016w\u2016,\nwhere \u03b7 satisfies \u2016w\u2217\u2016\u2212 V \u2032\u2217(\u03b7) = 0. Since both \u2016w\u2217\u2016 and \u2212V \u2032\u2217(\u03b7) are non-increasing functions in \u03b7, we can efficiently compute \u03b7 by a bi-section search.\nThe value of the step size \u03b3 in Algorithms 2 and 3 depends on the value of c, a constant that upper bounds the spectral norm square of the matrix H(X,y). In many machine\nlearning applications, by assuming a bound on the data (e.g., \u2016x\u20162 \u2264 R), one can easily compute an estimate of c. We present derivations of the constant c for hinge loss and generalized hinge loss in Appendix A. However, the computed value of c might be overestimated, thus the step size \u03b3 is underestimated. Therefore, to improve the empirical performances, one can scale up the estimated value of \u03b3 by a factor larger than one and choose the best factor by tuning among a set of values. In addition, the authors in (Chambolle and Pock, 2011) suggested a two step sizes scheme with \u03c4 for updating the primal variable and \u03c3 for updating the dual variable. Depending on the nature of applications, one may observe better performances by carefully choosing the ratio between the two step sizes provided that \u03c3 and \u03c4 satisfy \u03c3\u03c4 \u2264 1/c. In the last subsection, we observe the improved performance for solving SVM by using the two step sizes scheme and by carefully tuning the ratio between the two step sizes. Furthermore, (Pock and Chambolle, 2011) presents a technique for computing diagonal preconditioners in the cases when estimating the value of c is difficult for complex problems, and applies it to general linear programing problems and some computer vision problems.\nFinally, we discuss the two implementation schemes for Algorithms 2 and 3. Note that in Algorithm 2, we maintain and update two primal variables wt,ut \u2208 Rd, while in Algorithm 3 we maintain and update two dual variables \u03b1t,\u03b2t \u2208 Rn. We refer to the implementation with two primal variables as double-primal implementation and the one with two dual variables as double-dual implementation. In fact, we can also implement Algorithm 2 by double-dual implementation and implement Algorithm 3 by double-primal implementation. For Algorithm 2, in which the updates are\nwt = min w\u2208Qw \u2016w\u2212 (ut\u22121 \u2212 \u03b3Gw(\u03b1t\u22121))\u201622 2 + \u03b3\u03bbR(w)\n\u03b1t = min \u03b1\u2208Q\u03b1 \u2016\u03b1\u2212 (\u03b1t\u22121 + \u03b3G\u03b1(wt))\u201622 2 ut = wt + \u03b3(Gw(\u03b1t\u22121)\u2212Gw(\u03b1t)),\nwe can plug the expression of ut into wt and obtain\nwt = min w\u2208Qw \u2016w \u2212 (wt\u22121 + 2\u03b3Gw(\u03b1t\u22122)\u2212 2\u03b3Gw(\u03b1t\u22121))\u201622 2 + \u03b3\u03bbR(w)\n\u03b1t = min \u03b1\u2208Q\u03b1 \u2016\u03b1\u2212 (\u03b1t\u22121 + \u03b3G\u03b1(wt))\u201622 2\nTo implement above updates, we can only maintain one primal variable and two dual variables. Depending on the nature of implementation, one may be better than the other. For example, if the number of examples n is much larger than the number of dimensions d, the double-primal implementation may be more efficient than the double-dual implementation, and vice versa. In subsection 5.7, we provide more examples and an experiment to demonstrate this."}, {"heading": "4.5 Extensions and Discussion", "text": "Nonlinear model For a nonlinear model, the min-max formulation becomes\nmin g\u2208H\u03ba max \u03b1\u2208Q\u03b1 L(g,\u03b1;X,y) + \u03bbR(g),\nwhere H\u03ba is a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) endowed with a kernel function \u03ba(\u00b7, \u00b7). Algorithm 1 can be applied to obtain the nonlinear model by changing the primal\nvariable to g. For example, step 5 in Algorithm 1 is modified to the following composite gradient mapping\ngt = arg min g\u2208H\u03ba\n1 2 \u2016g \u2212 g\u0302t\u22121\u20162H\u03ba + \u03b3\u03bbR(g), (18)\nwhere\ng\u0302t\u22121 = (gt\u22121 \u2212 \u03b3\u2207gL(gt\u22121,\u03b1t;X,y)) .\nSimilar changes can be made to Algorithm 2 for the extension to the nonlinear model. To end this discussion, we make several remarks. (1) The gradient with respect to the primal variable (i.e., the kernel predictor g \u2208 H\u03ba) is computed on each g(xi) = \u3008g, \u03ba(xi, \u00b7)\u3009 by \u03ba(xi, \u00b7). (2) We can perform the computation by manipulating on a finite number of parameters due to the representer theorem provided that the regularizerR(g) is a monotonic norm (Bach et al., 2011). Therefore, we only need to maintain and update the coefficients \u03b6 = (\u03b61, . . . , \u03b6n) in g = \u2211n i=1 \u03b6i\u03ba(xi, \u00b7). (3) The primal dual prox method for optimization with nonlinear model has been adopted in our prior work (Yang et al., 2012) for multiple kernel learning where the regularizer is R(g1, . . . , gm) = ( \u2211m k=1 \u2016gk\u2016Hk)2. It can also be generalized to solve MKL with more general sparsity-induced norms. ((Bach et al., 2011) considers how to compute the proximal mapping in (18) for more general sparsity induced norms.)\nt\nIncorporating the bias term It is easy to learn a bias term w0 in the classifier w\u22a4x+w0 by Pdprox without too many changes. We can use the augmented feature vector\nx\u0302i = (\n1 xi\n) and the augmented weight vector w\u0302 = ( w0 w ) , and run Algorithms 1 or 2 with\nno changes except that the regularizer R(w\u0302) = R(w) does not involve w0 and the step size \u03b3 = \u221a 1/(2c) will be a different value due to the change in the bound of the new feature vectors by \u2016x\u0302\u20162 \u2264 \u221a 1 +R2, which would yield a different value of c in Lemma 3 (c.f. Appendix A).\nDomain constraint on primal variable Now we discuss how to generalize the convergence analysis to the case when a convex domain Qw is imposed on w. We introduce R\u0302(w) = \u03bbR(w) +Q(w), where Q(w) is an indicator function for w \u2208 Qw, i.e.\nQ(w) =\n{ 0 w \u2208 Qw\n+\u221e otherwise .\nThen we can write the domain constrained composite gradient mapping in step 5 of Algorithm 1 or step 4 of Algorithm 2 into a domain free composite gradient mapping as the following:\nwt = arg min w\u2208Rd\n1 2 \u2016w\u2212 (wt\u22121 \u2212 \u03b3Gw(wt\u22121,\u03b1t))\u201622 + \u03b3R\u0302(w),\nwt = arg min w\u2208Rd\n1 2 \u2016w\u2212 (ut\u22121 \u2212 \u03b3Gw(ut\u22121,\u03b1t\u22121))\u201622 + \u03b3R\u0302(w).\nThen we have an equivalent gradient mapping,\nwt = wt\u22121 \u2212 \u03b3Gw(wt\u22121,\u03b1t)\u2212 \u03b3\u2202R\u0302(wt), wt = ut\u22121 \u2212 \u03b3Gw(ut\u22121,\u03b1t\u22121)\u2212 \u03b3\u2202R\u0302(wt).\nThen Lemmas 9 and 10, and Lemmas 11 and 12 all hold as long as we replace \u03bbvt with v\u0302t \u2208 \u2202R\u0302(wt). Finally in proving Theorems 6 we can absorb Q(w) in L(w,\u03b1) + R\u0302(w) into the domain constraint.\nAdditional constraints on dual variables One advantage of the proposed primal dual prox method is that it provides a convenient way to handle additional constraints on the dual variables \u03b1. Several studies introduce additional constraints on the dual variables. In (Dekel and Singer, 2006), the authors address a budget SVM problem by introducing a 1 \u2212 \u221e interpolation norm on the empirical hinge loss, leading to a sparsity constraint \u2016\u03b1\u20161 \u2264 m on the dual variables, where m is the target number of support vectors. The corresponding optimization problem is given by\nmin w\u2208Rd max \u03b1\u2208[0,1]n,\u2016\u03b1\u20161\u2264m\n1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1i(1 \u2212 yiw\u22a4xi) + \u03bbR(w). (19)\nIn (Huang et al., 2010), a similar idea is applied to learn a distance metric from noisy training examples. We can directly apply Algorithms 1 or 2 to (19) with Q\u03b1 given by Q\u03b1 = {\u03b1 : \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]n, \u2016\u03b1\u20161 \u2264 m}. The prox mapping to this domain can be efficiently computed by Lemma 13. It is straightforward to show that the convergence rate is [D1 +m]/[ \u221a 2nT ] in this case."}, {"heading": "5. Experiments", "text": "In this section we present empirical studies to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. We organize our experiments as follows.\n\u2022 In subsections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 we compare the proposed algorithm to the state-of-the-art first order methods that directly update the primal variable at each iteration. We apply all the algorithms to three different tasks with different non-smooth loss functions and regularizers. The baseline first order methods used in this study include the gradient descent algorithm (gd), the forward and backward splitting algorithm (fobos) (Duchi and Singer, 2009), the regularized dual averaging algorithm (rda) (Xiao, 2009), the accelerated gradient descent algorithm (agd) (Chen et al., 2009). Since the proposed method is a non-stochastic method, we compare it to the non-stochastic variant of gd, fobos, and rda. Note that gd, fobos, rda, and agd share the same convergence rate of O(1/ \u221a T ) for non-smooth problems.\n\u2022 In subsection 5.4, our algorithm is compared to the state-of-the-art primal dual gradient method (Nesterov, 2005b), which employs an excessive gap technique for non-smooth optimization, updates both the primal and dual variables at each iteration, and has a convergence rate of O(1/T ).\n\u2022 In subsection 5.5, we test the proposed algorithm for optimizing problem in (19) with a sparsity constraint on the dual variables.\n\u2022 In subsection 5.7, we compare the two variants of the proposed method on a data set when n \u226b d, and compare Pdprox to the Pegasos algorithm.\nAll the algorithms are implemented in Matlab (except otherwise mentioned) and run on a 2.4GHZ machine. Since the performance of the baseline algorithms gd, fobos and rda depends heavily on the initial value of the stepsize, we generate 21 values for the initial stepsize by scaling their theoretically optimal values with factors 2[\u221210:1:10], and report the best convergence among the 21 possible values. The stepsize of agd is changed adaptively in the optimization process, and we just give it an appropriate initial step size. Since in the first four subsections we focus on comparison with baselines, we use the Pdprox-dual algorithm (Algorithm 1) of the proposed Pdprox method. We also use the tuning technique to select the best scale-up factor for the step size \u03b3 of Pdprox.

This dataset was originally used for splice site detection. It is divided into a training set and a test set: the training set consists of 8, 415 true and 179, 438 false donor sites, and the testing set has 4, 208 true and 89, 717 false donor sites. Each example in this dataset was originally described by a sequence of {A, C, G, T} of length 7. We follow (Yang et al., 2010) and generate group features with up to three-way interactions between the 7 positions, leading to 2, 604 attributes in 63 groups. We normalize the length of each example to 1. Following the experimental setup in (Yang et al., 2010), we construct a balanced training dataset consisting of all 8, 415 true and 8, 415 false donor sites that are randomly sampled from all 179, 438 false sites.\nTwo non-smooth loss functions are examined in this experiment: hinge loss and absolute loss. Figure 2 plots the values of the objective function vs. running time (second), using two different values of regularization parameter, i.e., \u03bb = 10\u22123, 10\u22125 to produce different levels\nof sparsity. We observe that (i) the proposed algorithm Pdprox clearly outperforms all the baseline algorithms in all the cases; (ii) for the absolute loss, which has a sharp curvature change at zero compared to hinge loss, the baseline algorithms of gd, fobos, rda, agd, especially of agd that is originally designed for smooth loss functions, deteriorate significantly compared to the proposed algorithm Pdprox. Finally, we observe that for the hinge loss and \u03bb = 10\u22123, the classification performance of the proposed algorithm on the testing dataset is 0.6565, measured by maximum correlation coefficient (Yeo and Burge, 2003). This is almost identical to the best result reported in (Yang et al., 2010) (i.e., 0.6520)."}, {"heading": "5.2 \u21131,\u221e regularization for Multi-Task Learning", "text": "In this experiment, we perform multi-task regression with \u21131,\u221e regularizer (Chen et al., 2009).

Finally, we observe that the regression performance measured by root mean square error (RMSE) on the testing data set for absolute loss and \u01eb-insensitive loss is 10.34 (optimized by Pdprox), comparable to the performance reported in (Chen et al., 2009)."}, {"heading": "5.3 Trace norm regularization for Max-Margin Matrix Factorization/ Matrix Completion", "text": "In this experiment, we evaluate the proposed method using trace norm regularization, a regularizer often used in max-margin matrix factorization and matrix completion, where the goal is to recover a full matrix X from partially observed matrix Y. The objective is composed of a loss function measuring the difference between X and Y on the observed entries and a trace norm regularizer on X, assuming that X is low rank. Hinge loss function is used in max-margin matrix factorization (Rennie and Srebro, 2005; Srebro et al., 2005), and absolute loss is used instead of square loss in matrix completion. We test on 100K MovieLens data set 3 that contains 1 million ratings from 943 users on 1682 movies. Since there are five distinct ratings that can be assigned to each movie, we follow (Rennie and Srebro, 2005; Srebro et al., 2005) by introducing four thresholds \u03b81,2,3,4 to measure the hinge loss between the predicted value Xij and the ground truth Yij . Because our goal is to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for non-smooth optimization, therefore we simply set \u03b81,2,3,4 = (0, 3, 6, 9). Note that we did not compare to the optimization algorithm in (Rennie and Srebro, 2005) since it cast the problem into a non-convex problem by using explicit factorization of X = UV\u22a4, which suffers a local minimum, and the optimization algorithm in (Srebro et al., 2005) since it formulated the problem into a SDP problem, which suffers from a high computational cost. To apply Nesterov\u2019s method, we write \u2016X\u20161 = max\u2016A\u2016\u22641 tr(A\u22a4X), and at each iteration we need to solve a maximization problem max\u2016A\u2016\u22641 \u03bbtr(A\n\u22a4X) \u2212 \u00b52 \u2016A\u20162F , where \u2016A\u2016 is the spectral norm on A. The solution of this optimization is obtained by performing SVD decomposition of X and thresholding the singular values appropriately. Since MovieLens data set is much larger than the data sets used in last two subsections, in this experiment, we (i) run all the algorithms for 1000 iterations and plot the objective versus time; (ii) enlarge the range of tuning parameters to 2[\u221215:1:15]. The results are shown in Figure 4, from which we observe that (i) Pdprox can quickly reduce the objective in a small amount of time, e.g., for absolute loss when setting \u03bb = 10\u22123 in order to obtain a solution with an accuracy of 10\u22123, Pdprox needs 103 second, while agd needs 3.2 \u00d7 104 seconds; (ii) for absolute loss no matter how we tune the stepsizes for each baseline algorithm, Pdprox performs the best; and (iii) for hinge loss when \u03bb = 10\u22125, by tuning the stepsizes of baseline algorithms, gd, fobos, and rda can achieve comparable performance to Pdprox. We note that although agd can achieve smaller objective value than Pdprox at the end of 1000 iterations, however, the objective value is reduced slowly."}, {"heading": "5.4 Comparison: Pdprox vs Primal-Dual method with excessive gap technique", "text": "In this section, we compare the proposed primal dual prox method to Nesterov\u2019s primal dual method (Nesterov, 2005b), which is an improvement of his algorithm in (Nesterov, 2005a). The algorithm in (Nesterov, 2005a) for non-smooth optimization suffers a problem of setting the value of smoothing parameter that requires the number of iterations to be fixed in advance. (Nesterov, 2005b) addresses the problem by exploring an excessive gap technique and updating both the primal and dual variables, which is similar to the proposed Pdprox method. We refer to this baseline as Pdexg. We run both algorithms on the three tasks as in subsections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3, i.e., group feature selection with hinge loss and group lasso regularizer on MEMset Donar data set, multi-task learning with \u01eb-insensitive loss and \u21131,\u221e regularizer on School data set, and matrix completion with absolute loss and trace norm regularizer on 100K MovieLens data set. To implement the primal dual method with excessive gap technique, we need to intentionally add a domain on the optimal primal\n3. http://www.cs.umn.edu/Research/GroupLens/\nvariable, which can be derived from the formulation. For example, in group feature selection problem whose objective is 1/n \u2211n i=1 \u2113(w \u22a4xi, yi) + \u03bb \u2211 g \u221a dg\u2016wg\u20162, we can derive that\nthe optimal primal variable w\u2217 lies in \u2016w\u20162 \u2264 \u2211\ng \u2016wg\u20162 \u2264 1\u03bb\u221admin , where dmin = ming dg. Similar techniques are applied to multi-task learning and matrix completion.\nThe performance of the two algorithms on the three tasks is shown in Figure 5. Since both algorithms are in the same category, i.e. updating both primal and dual variables at each iteration and having a convergence rate in the order of O(1/T ), we also plot the objective versus the number of iterations in the bottom panels of each subfigure in Figure 5. The results show that the proposed Pdprox method converges faster than Pdexg onMEMset Donar data set for group feature selection with hinge loss and group lasso regularizer, and on 100K MovieLens data set for matrix completion with absolute loss and trace norm regularizer. However, Pdexg performs better on School data set for multi-task learning with \u01eb-insensitive loss and \u21131,\u221e regularizer. One interesting phenomenon we can observe from Figure 5 is that for larger values of \u03bb (e.g., 10\u22123), the improvement of Pdprox over Pdexg is also larger. The reason is that the proposed Pdprox captures the sparsity of primal variable at each iteration. This does not hold for Pdexg because it casts the non-smooth regularizer into a dual form and consequently does not explore the sparsity of the primal variable at each iteration. Therefore the larger of \u03bb, the sparser of the primal variable at each iteration in Pdprox that yields to larger improvement over Pdexg. For the example of group feature selection task with hinge loss and group lasso regularizer, when setting \u03bb = 10\u22123, the sparsity of the primal variable (i.e., the proportion of the number of group features with zero norm) in Pdprox averaged over all iterations is 0.7886. However, by reducing \u03bb to 10\u22125 the average sparsity of the primal variable in Pdprox is reduced to 0. In both settings the average sparsity of the primal variable in Pdexg is 0. The same argument also explains why Pdprox does not perform as well as Pdexg on School data set when setting \u03bb = 10\u22125, since in this case the primal variables in both algorithms are not sparse. When setting \u03bb = 10\u22123, the average sparsity (i.e., the proportion of the number of features with zero norm across all tasks) of the primal variable in Pdprox and Pdexg is 0.3766 and 0, respectively. Finally, we also observe similar performance of the two algorithms on the three tasks with other loss functions including absolute loss for group feature selection, absolute loss for multi-task learning, and hinge loss for max-margin matrix factorization."}, {"heading": "5.5 Sparsity constraint on the dual variables", "text": "In this subsection, we examine empirically the proposed algorithm for optimizing the problem in equation (19), in which a sparsity constraint is introduced for the dual variables.\nWe test the algorithm on three large data sets from the UCI repository, namely, a9a, rcv1(binary) and covtye4. In the experiments we use \u211322 regularizer and fix \u03bb = 1/n. First, we run the proposed algorithm 100 seconds on the three data sets with different values of m = 100, 200, 400 and plot the objective versus the number of iterations. The results are shown in Figure 6, which verify that the convergence is faster with smaller m, which is consistent with the convergence bound O([D + m]/[ \u221a 2n\u03bb]) of the proposed algorithm for (19).\nSecond, we demonstrate that the formulation in equation (19) with a sparsity constraint on the dual variables is useful in the case when labels are contaminated with noise. To generate the noise in labels, we randomly flip the labels with a probability 0.2. We run both the proposed algorithm for (19) and Liblinear5 on the training data with noise added to the labels. The stopping criterion for the proposed algorithm is when duality gap is less than 10\u22123, and for Liblinear is when the maximal dual violation is less than 10\u22123. The running time and accuracy on testing data averaged over 5 random trials are reported in Table 1, which demonstrate that in the presence of noise in labels, by adding a sparsity constraint on the dual variables, we are able to obtain better performance than Liblinear trained on the noisily labeled data. Furthermore the running time of Pdprox is comparable to, if not less than, that of Liblinear.\nFinally, we note that choosing a small m in equation (19) is different from simply training a classifier with a small number of examples. For instance, for rcv1, we have run the experiment with 200 training examples, randomly selected from the entire data set. With the same stopping criterion, the testing performance is 0.8131(\u00b10.05), significantly lower than that of optimizing (19) with m = 200."}, {"heading": "5.6 Comparison: double-primal vs double-dual implementation", "text": "From the discussion in subsection 4.4, we have seen that both Pdprox-primal and Pdproxdual algorithm can be implemented either by maintaining two dual variables, to which we refer as double-dual implementation, or by maintaining two primal variables, to which we refer as double-primal implementation. One implementation could be more efficient than the other implementation, depending on the nature of applications. For example, in multitask regression with \u21132 loss (Nie et al., 2010), if the number of examples is much larger than the number of attributes, i.e., n \u226b d, and the number of tasks K is large, then the size of dual variable \u03b1 \u2208 Rn\u00d7K is much larger than the size of primal variable W \u2208 Rd\u00d7K .

We choose web spam data set 6 as the testing bed, which contains 350000 examples, and 16609143 trigrams extracted for each example. We use hinge loss and \u211322 regularizer with \u03bb = 1/n, where n is the number of experimented data.\nWe demonstrate that when d \u226b n, the double-dual implementation is more efficient than double-primal implementation. For the purpose of demonstration, we randomly sample from the whole data a subset of n = 1000 examples, which have a total of 8287348 features, and we solve the sub-optimization problem over the subset. It is worth noting that such kind of problem appears commonly in distributed computing on individual nodes when the number of attributes is huge. The objective value versus running time of the two implementations of Pdprox-dual are plotted in Figure 7, which shows that doubledual implementation is more efficient than double-primal implementation is this case. As a complement, we also plot the objective of Pdprox-dual and Pdprox-primal both with double-dual implementation, which shows that Pdprox-primal and Pdprox-dual performs similarly."}, {"heading": "5.7 Comparison for solving \u211322 regularized SVM", "text": "In this subsection, we compare the proposed Pdprox method with Pegasos for solving \u211322 regularized SVM when \u03bb = O(n\n\u22121/(1+\u01eb), \u01eb \u2208 (0, 1].

Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we study non-smooth optimization in machine learning where both the loss function and the regularizer are non-smooth. We develop an efficient gradient based method for a family of non-smooth optimization problems in which the dual form of the loss function can be expressed as a bilinear function in primal and dual variables. We show that, assuming the proximal step can be efficiently solved, the proposed algorithm achieves a convergence rate of O(1/T ), faster than O(1/ \u221a T ) suffered by many other first order methods for non-smooth optimization. In contrast to existing studies on non-smooth optimization, our work enjoys more simplicity in implementation and analysis, and provides a unified methodology for a diverse set of non-smooth optimization problems. Our empirical studies demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in comparison with the state-of-theart first order methods for solving many non-smooth machine learning problems, and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for optimizing the problem with a sparse constraint on the dual variables for tackling the noise in labels. In future, we plan to adapt the proposed algorithm for stochastic updating and for distributed computing environments."}, {"heading": "Appendix A.

Tseng (2008) and Nemirovski (2005) developed prox methods that have a convergence rate of O(1/T ), provided the gradients are Lipschitz continuous and have been applied to machine learning problems (Sun et al., 2009). In contrast, our method achieves a rate of O(1/T ) without requiring the whole gradient but part of the gradient to be Lipschitz continuous. Several other primal-dual algorithms have been developed for regularized empirical loss minimization that update both primal and dual variables. (Zhu and Chan, 2008) proposed a primal-dual method based on gradient descent, which only achieves a rate of O(1/ \u221a T ). It was generalized in (Esser et al., 2010), which shares the similar spirit of the proposed algorithm. However, the explicit convergence rate was not established even though the convergence is proved. (Mosci et al., 2010) presented a primal-dual algorithm for group sparse regularization, which updates the primal variable by a prox method and the dual variable by a Newton\u2019s method. In contrast, the proposed algorithm is a first order method that does not require computing the Hessian matrix as the Newton\u2019s method does, and is therefore more scalable to large datasets. (Combettes and Pesquet; Radu loan Bot, 2012) proposed primal-dual splitting algorithms for finding zeros of maximal monotone operators of special types. (Lan et al., 2011) considered the primal-dual convex formulations for general cone programming and apply Nesterov\u2019s optimal first order method (Nesterov, 2007), Nesterov\u2019s smoothing technique (Nesterov, 2005a), and Nemirovski\u2019s prox method (Nemirovski, 2005).

Previous studies on efficient empirical loss minimization assume either a smooth loss function or a strongly convex regularizer, making them unsuitable for non-smooth optimization. We develop a simple yet efficient method for a family of non-smooth optimization problems where the dual form of the loss function is bilinear in primal and dual variables. We cast a non-smooth optimization problem into a minimax optimization problem, and develop a primal dual prox method that solves the minimax optimization problem at a rate of O(1/T ) assuming that the proximal step can be efficiently solved, significantly faster than a standard subgradient descent method that has an O(1/ \u221a T ) convergence rate. Our empirical study verifies the efficiency of the proposed method for various non-smooth optimization problems that arise ubiquitously in machine learning by comparing it to the state-of-the-art first order methods.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
