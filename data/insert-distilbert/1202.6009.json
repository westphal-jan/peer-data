If the data set being published consists of records corresponding to individuals, usual SDC methods operate by masking original data (via perturbation or detail reduction), by generating synthetic (simulated) data preserving some statistical features of the original data or by producing hybrid data obtained as a combination of original and synthetic data. Whatever the protection method chosen, the resulting data should still preserve enough analytical validity for their publication to be useful to potential users.\nA microdata set can be defined as a file with a number of records, where each record contains a number of attributes on an individual respondent. Attributes can be classified depending on their range and the operations that can be performed on them:\n1. Numerical. An attribute is considered numerical if arithmetical operations can be performed on it. Examples are income and age. When designing methods to protect numerical data, one has the advantage that arithmetical operations are possible, and the drawback that every combination of numerical values in the original data set is likely to be unique, which leads to disclosure if no action is taken.\n2. Categorical. An attribute is considered categorical when it takes values over a finite set and standard arithmetical operations on it do not make sense. Two main types of categorical attributes can be distinguished:\n(a) Ordinal. An ordinal attribute takes values in an ordered range of categories. Thus, the \u2264, max and min operators are meaningful and can be used by SDC techniques for ordinal data. The instruction level and the political preferences (left-right) are examples of ordinal attributes.\n(b) Nominal. A nominal attribute takes values in an unordered range of categories. The only possible operator is comparison for equality. Nominal attributes can further be divided into two types:\ni. Hierarchical. A hierarchical nominal attribute takes values from a hierarchical classification. For example, plants are classified using Linnaeus\u2019s taxonomy, the type of a disease is also selected from a hierarchical taxonomy, and the type of an attribute can be selected from the hierarchical classification we propose in this section.\nii. Non-hierarchical. A non-hierarchical nominal attribute takes values from a flat hierarchy. Examples of such attributes could be the preferred soccer team, the address of an individual, the civil status (married, single, divorced, widow/er), the eye color, etc.\nThis paper focuses on finding a numerical mapping of nominal attributes, and more precisely hierarchical nominal attributes. In addition to other conceivable applications not dealt with in this paper, such a mapping can be used\nto anonymize nominal data in ways so far reserved to numerical data. The interest of this is that many more SDC methods exist for anonymizing numerical data than categorical and especially nominal data.\nAssuming a hierarchy is less restrictive than it would appear, because very often a non-hierarchical attribute can be turned into a hierarchical one if its flat hierarchy can be developed into a multilevel hierarchy. For instance, the preferred soccer and the address of an individual have been mentioned as nonhierarchical attributes; however, a hierarchy of soccer teams by continent and country could be conceived, and addresses can be hierarchically clustered by neighborhood, city, state, country, etc. Furthermore, well-known approaches to anonynimization, like k-anonymity [7], assume that any attribute can be generalized, i.e. that an attribute hierarchy can be defined and values at lower levels of the hierarchy can be replaced by values at higher levels."}, {"heading": "1.1 Contribution and plan of this paper", "text": "We propose to associate a number to each categorical value of a hierarchical nominal attribute, namely a form of centrality of that category within the attribute\u2019s hierarchy.

Section 3 defines a tree centrality measure called marginality and presents the numerical mapping. Section 4 exploits the numerical mapping to compute means, variances and covariances of hierarchical nominal data. Conclusions are drawn in Section 5."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "We next recall the variance measure for hierarchical nominal attributes introduced in [2]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first measure which captures the variability of a sample of values of a hierarchical nominal attribute by taking into account the semantics of the hierarchy. The intuitive idea is that a set of nominal values belonging to categories which are all children of the same parent category in the hierarchy has smaller variance that a set with children from different parent categories.\nAlgorithm 1 (Nominal variance in [2])\n1. Let the hierarchy of categories of a nominal attribute X be such that b is the maximum number of children that a parent category can have in the hierarchy.\n2. Given a sample TX of nominal categories drawn from X, place them in the tree representing the hierarchy of X. Prune the subtrees whose nodes have no associated sample values. If there are repeated sample values, there will\nbe several nominal values associated to one or more nodes (categories) in the pruned tree.\n3. Label as follows the edges remaining in the tree from the root node to each of its children:\n\u2022 If b is odd, consider the following succession of labels l0 = (b\u2212 1)/2, l1 = (b\u22121)/2\u22121, l2 = (b\u22121)/2+1, l3 = (b\u22121)/2\u22122, l4 = (b\u22121)/2+2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , lb\u22122 = 0, lb\u22121 = b\u2212 1. \u2022 If b is even, consider the following succession of labels l0 = (b\u2212 2)/2, l1 = (b\u22122)/2+1, l2 = (b\u22122)/2\u22121, l3 = (b\u22122)/2+2, l4 = (b\u22122)/2\u22122, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , lb\u22122 = 0, lb\u22121 = b\u2212 1. \u2022 Label the edge leading to the child with most categories associated to its descendant subtree as l0, the edge leading to the child with the second highest number of categories associated to its descendant subtree as l1, the one leading to the child with the third highest number of categories associated to its descendant subtree as l2 and, in general, the edge leading to the child with the i-th highest number of categories associated to its descendant subtree as li\u22121. Since there are at most b children, the set of labels {l0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , lb\u22121} should suffice. Thus an edge label can be viewed as a b-ary digit (to the base b).\n4. Recursively repeat Step 3 taking instead of the root node each of the root\u2019s child nodes.\n5. Assign to values associated to each node in the hierarchy a node label consisting of a b-ary number constructed from the edge labels, more specifically as the concatenation of the b-ary digits labeling the edges along the path from the root to the node: the label of the edge starting from the root is the most significant one and the edge label closest to the specific node is the least significant one.\n6. Let L be the maximal length of the leaf b-ary labels. Append as many l0 digits as needed in the least significant positions to the shorter labels so that all of them eventually consist of L digits.\n7. Let TX(0) be the set of b-ary digits in the least significant positions of the node labels (the \u201cunits\u201d positions); let TX(1) be the set of b-ary digits in the second least significant positions of the node labels (the \u201ctens\u201d positions), and so on, until TX(L\u22121) which is the set of digits in the most significant positions of the node labels.\n8. Compute the variance of the sample as\nV arH(TX) = V ar(TX(0)) + b 2 \u00b7 V ar(TX(1)) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n+ b2(L\u22121) \u00b7 V ar(TX(L\u2212 1)) (1) where V ar(\u00b7) is the usual numerical variance.\nIn Section 4.2 below we will show that an equivalent measure can be obtained in a simpler and more manageable way."}, {"heading": "3 A numerical mapping for nominal hierarchical", "text": "data\nConsider a nominal attribute X taking values from a hierarchical classification. Let TX be a sample of values of X . Each value x \u2208 TX can be associated two numerical values:\n\u2022 The sample frequency of x;\n\u2022 Some centrality measure of x within the hierarchy of X .\nWhile the frequency depends on the particular sample, centrality measures depend both on the attribute hierarchy and the sample. Known tree centralities attempt to determine the \u201cmiddle\u201d of a tree [6]. We are rather interested in finding how far from the middle is each node of the tree, that is, how marginal it is. We next propose an algorithm to compute a new measure of the marginality of the values in the sample TX .\nAlgorithm 2 (Marginality of nominal values)\n1. Given a sample TX of nominal categorical values drawn from X, place them in the tree representing the hierarchy of X. There is a one-to-one mapping between the set of tree nodes and the set of categories where X takes values. Prune the subtrees whose nodes have no associated sample values. If there are repeated sample values, there will be several nominal values associated to one or more nodes (categories) in the pruned tree.\n2. Let L be the depth of the pruned tree. Associate weight 2L\u22121 to edges linking the root of the hierarchy to its immediate descendants (depth 1), weight 2L\u22122 to edges linking the depth 1 descendants to their own descendants (depth 2), and so on, up to weight 20 = 1 to the edges linking descendants at depth L\u2212 1 with those at depth L. In general, weight 2L\u2212i is assigned to edges linking nodes at depth i\u2212 1 with those at depth i, for i = 1 to L.\n3. For each nominal value xj in the sample, its marginality m(xj) is defined and computed as\nm(xj) = \u2211\nxl\u2208TX\u2212{xj}\nd(xj , xl)\nwhere d(xj , xl) is the sum of the edge weights along the shortest path from the tree node corresponding to xj and the tree node corresponding to xl.\nClearly, the greater m(xj), the more marginal (i.e. the less central) is xj . Some properties follow which illustrate the rationale of the distance and the weights used to compute the marginality.\nLemma 1 d(\u00b7, \u00b7) is a distance in the mathematical sense.\nBeing the length of a path, it is immediate to check that d(\u00b7, \u00b7) satisfies reflexivity, symmetry and subadditivity. The rationale of the above exponential weight scheme is to give more weight to differences at higher levels of the hierarchy; specifically, the following property is satisfied.\nLemma 2 The distance between any non-root node nj and its immediate ancestor is greater than the distance between nj and any of its descendants.\nProof: Let L be the depth of the overall tree and Lj be the depth of nj . The distance between nj and its immediate ancestor is 2\nL\u2212Lj . The distance between nj and its most distant ancestor is\n1 + 2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ 2L\u2212Lj\u22121 = 2L\u2212Lj \u2212 1\nLemma 3 The distance between any two nodes at the same depth is greater than the longest distance within the subtree rooted at each node.\nProof: Let L be the depth of the overall tree and Lj be the depth of the two nodes. The shortest distance between both nodes occurs when they have the same parent and it is\n2 \u00b7 2L\u2212Lj = 2L\u2212Lj+1.\nThe longest distance within any of the two subtrees rooted at the two nodes at depth Lj is the length of the path between two leaves at depth L, which is\n2 \u00b7 (1 + 2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ 2L\u2212Lj\u22121) = 2(2L\u2212Lj \u2212 1) = 2L\u2212Lj+1 \u2212 2"}, {"heading": "4 Statistical analysis of numerically mapped nom-", "text": "inal data\nIn the previous section we have shown how a nominal value xj can be associated a marginality measure m(xj).

We have shown how such a numerical mapping allows computing means, variances and covariances of nominal attributes, and distances between records containing any kind of attributes. Such enhanced flexility of manipulation of nominal attributes can be used, e.g. to adapt anonymization methods intented for numerical data to the treament of nominal and hierarchical attributes. The only requirement is that, whatever the treatment, it should not\nmodify the numerical values assigned by marginality, in order for the numerical mapping to be reversible and allow recovering the original nominal values after treatment.\nAppendix\nProof (Lemma 4): We will show that, given two samples TX = {x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xn} and T \u2032X = {x\u20321, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , x\u2032n} of a nominal attributeX , both with the same cardinality n, it holds that V arM (TX) < V arM (T \u2032 X) if and only if V arH(TX) < V arH(T \u2032 X).\nAssume that V arM (TX) < V arM (T \u2032 X).

To check Inequality (8) with d = 1, we can ignore the variance in the denominators (it is the same on both sides) and we just need to check\n\u221a\nS213 ? \u2264\n\u221a S212 + \u221a S223 (9)\nWe have\nS213 = V ar({x1, x3}) = m(x1) +m(x3)\n2\n= d(x1, x3)\n2 +\nd(x3, x1)\n2 = d(x1, x3) (10)\nSimilarly S212 = d(x1, x2) and S 2 23 = d(x2, x3). Therefore, Expression (9) is equivalent to subaddivitity for d(\u00b7, \u00b7) and the latter holds by Lemma 1. Let us now make the induction hypothesis for d\u2212 1 and prove subadditivity for any d. Call now\nA := (S2)113 (S2)1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ (S 2)d\u2212113 (S2)d\u22121\nA\u2032 := (S2)112 (S2)1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ (S 2)d\u2212112 (S2)d\u22121\nA\u2032\u2032 := (S2)123 (S2)1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ (S 2)d\u2212123 (S2)d\u22121\nB := (S2)d13 (S2)d ; B\u2032 := (S2)d12 (S2)d ; B\u2032\u2032 := (S2)d23 (S2)d\nSubadditivity for d amounts to checking whether\n\u221a A+B ? \u2264 \u221a A\u2032 +B\u2032 + \u221a A\u2032\u2032 +B\u2032\u2032 (11)\nwhich holds by Lemma 5 because, by the induction hypothesis for d\u22121, we have\u221a A \u2264 \u221a A\u2032 + \u221a A\u2032\u2032 and, by the proof for d = 1, we have \u221a B \u2264 \u221a B\u2032 + \u221a B\u2032\u2032.\nProof (Theorem 2): Non-negativity, reflexivity and symmetry are proven in a way analogous as in Theorem 1. As to subaddivity, we just need to prove the case d = 1, that is, the inequality analogous to Expression (9) for numerical variances. The proof for general d is the same as in Theorem 1. For d = 1, we have\nS213 = (x1 \u2212 x3)2\n2 ; S212 = (x1 \u2212 x2)2 2 ; S223 = (x2 \u2212 x3)2\n2 Therefore, Expression (9) obviously holds with equality in the case of numerical variances because\n\u221a S213 = x1 \u2212 x3\u221a\n2 = (x1 \u2212 x2) + (x2 \u2212 x3)\u221a 2 = \u221a S212 + \u221a S223\nAcknowledgments and disclaimer\nThanks go to Klara Stokes for useful help.

SDC methods are either based on masking the original data, generating synthetic versions of them or creating hybrid versions by combining original and synthetic data. The choice of SDC methods for categorical data, especially nominal data, is much smaller than the choice of methods for numerical data. We mitigate this problem by introducing a numerical mapping for hierarchical nominal data which allows computing means, variances and covariances on them.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
