The most wildly successful class of algorithms for taking advantage of this type of problem structure are stochastic gradient (SG) methods Robbins and Monro [1951], Bottou and LeCun [2003]. Although the theory behind SG methods allows them to be applied more generally, in the context of machine learning SG methods are typically used to solve the problem of optimizing a sample average over a finite training set, i.e.,\nminimize x\u2208Rp\ng(x) := 1\nn n\u2211 i=1 fi(x). (1)\nIn this work, we focus on such finite training data problems where each fi is smooth and the average function g is strongly-convex.\nAs an example, in the case of `2-regularized logistic regression we have fi(x) := \u03bb 2 \u2016x\u2016 2 + log(1 + exp(\u2212biaTi x)), where ai \u2208 Rp and bi \u2208 {\u22121, 1} are the training examples associated with a binary classification problem and \u03bb is a regularization parameter. More generally, any `2-regularized empirical risk minimization problem of the form\nminimize x\u2208Rp\n\u03bb 2 \u2016x\u20162 + 1 n n\u2211 i=1 li(x), (2)\nar X\niv :1\n20 2.\n62 58\nv4 [\nm at\nh. O\nC ]\nfalls in the framework of (1) provided that the loss functions li are convex and smooth. An extensive list of convex loss functions used in machine learning is given by Teo et al. [2007], and we can even include non-smooth loss functions (or regularizers) by using smooth approximations.\nThe standard full gradient (FG) method, which dates back to Cauchy [1847], uses iterations of the form\nxk+1 = xk \u2212 \u03b1kg\u2032(xk) = xk \u2212 \u03b1k n n\u2211 i=1 f \u2032i(x k). (3)\nUsing x\u2217 to denote the unique minimizer of g, the FG method with a constant step size achieves a linear convergence rate:\ng(xk)\u2212 g(x\u2217) = O(\u03c1k),\nfor some \u03c1 < 1 which depends on the condition number of g [Nesterov, 2004, Theorem 2.1.15]. Linear convergence is also known as geometric or exponential convergence, because the cost is cut by a fixed fraction on each iteration. Despite the fast convergence rate of the FG method, it can be unappealing when n is large because its iteration cost scales linearly in n. SG methods, on the other hand, have an iteration cost which is independent of n, making them suited for that setting. The basic SG method for optimizing (1) uses iterations of the form\nxk+1 = xk \u2212 \u03b1kf \u2032ik(x k), (4)\nwhere \u03b1k is a step-size and a training example ik is selected uniformly among the set {1, . . . , n}. The randomly chosen gradient f \u2032ik(x\nk) yields an unbiased estimate of the true gradient g\u2032(xk), and one can show under standard assumptions that, for a suitably chosen decreasing step-size sequence {\u03b1k}, the SG iterations achieve the sublinear convergence rate\nE[g(xk)]\u2212 g(x\u2217) = O(1/k),\nwhere the expectation is taken with respect to the selection of the ik variables. Under certain assumptions this convergence rate is optimal for strongly-convex optimization in a model of computation where the algorithm only accesses the function through unbiased measurements of its objective and gradient (see Nemirovski and Yudin [1983], Nemirovski et al. [2009], Agarwal et al. [2012]). Thus, we cannot hope to obtain a better convergence rate if the algorithm only relies on unbiased gradient measurements. Nevertheless, by using the stronger assumption that the functions are sampled from a finite dataset, in this paper we show that we can achieve an exponential converengence rate while preserving the iteration cost of SG methods.\nThe primay contribution of this work is the analysis of a new algorithm that we call the stochastic average gradient (SAG) method, a randomized variant of the incremental aggregated gradient (IAG) method Blatt et al. [2007], which combines the low iteration cost of SG methods with a linear convergence rate as in FG methods. The SAG method uses iterations of the form\nxk+1 = xk \u2212 \u03b1k n n\u2211 i=1 yki , (5)\nwhere at each iteration a random training example ik is selected and we set\nyki =\n{ f \u2032i(x k) if i = ik,\nyk\u22121i otherwise.\nThat is, like the FG method, the step incorporates a gradient with respect to each training example. But, like the SG method, each iteration only computes the gradient with respect to a single training example and the cost of the iterations is independent of n. Despite the low cost of the SAG\niterations, in this paper we show that the SAG iterations have a linear convergence rate, like the FG method. That is, by having access to ik and by keeping a memory of the most recent gradient value computed for each training example i, this iteration achieves a faster convergence rate than is possible for standard SG methods. Further, in terms of effective passes through the data, we also show that for certain problems the convergence rate of SAG is faster than is possible for standard FG methods.\nIn a machine learning context where g(x) is a training cost associated with a predictor parameterized by x, we are often ultimately interested in the testing cost, the expected loss on unseen data points. Note that a linear convergence rate for the training cost does not translate into a similar rate for the testing cost, and an appealing propertly of SG methods is that they achieve the optimal O(1/k) rate for the testing cost as long as every datapoint is seen only once. However, as is common in machine learning, we assume that we are only given a finite training data set and thus that datapoints are revisited multiple times. In this context, the analysis of SG methods only applies to the training cost and, although our analysis also focuses on the training cost, in our experiments the SAG method typically reached the optimal testing cost faster than both FG and SG methods.\nThe next section reviews closely-related algorithms from the literature, including previous attempts to combine the appealing aspects of FG and SG methods. However, despite 60 years of extensive research on SG methods, most of the applications focusing on finite datasets, we are not aware of any other SG method that achieves a linear convergence rate while preserving the iteration cost of standard SG methods. Section 3 states the (standard) assumptions underlying our analysis and gives the main technical results; we first give a slow linear convergence rate that applies for any problem, and then give a very fast linear convergence rate that applies when n is sufficiently large. Section 4 discusses practical implementation issues, including how to reduce the storage cost from O(np) to O(n) when each fi only depends on a linear combination of x. Section 5 presents a numerical comparison of an implementation based on SAG to SG and FG methods, indicating that the method may be very useful for problems where we can only afford to do a few passes through a data set."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "There is a large variety of approaches available to accelerate the convergence of SG methods, and a full review of this immense literature would be outside the scope of this work. Below, we comment on the relationships between the new method and several of the most closely-related ideas.\nMomentum: SG methods that incorporate a momentum term use iterations of the form\nxk+1 = xk \u2212 \u03b1kf \u2032ik(x k) + \u03b2k(x k \u2212 xk\u22121),\nsee Tseng [1998]. It is common to set all \u03b2k = \u03b2 for some constant \u03b2, and in this case we can rewrite the SG with momentum method as\nxk+1 = xk \u2212 \u2211k j=1 \u03b1j\u03b2 k\u2212jf \u2032ij (x j).\nWe can re-write the SAG updates (5) in a similar form as\nxk+1 = xk \u2212 \u2211k j=1 \u03b1kS(j, i1:k)f \u2032 ij (xj), (6)\nwhere the selection function S(j, i1:k) is equal to 1/n if j corresponds to the last iteration where j = ik and is set to 0 otherwise. Thus, momentum uses a geometric weighting of previous gradients while the SAG iterations select and average the most recent evaluation of each previous gradient.\nWhile momentum can lead to improved practical performance, it still requires the use of a decreasing sequence of step sizes and is not known to lead to a faster convergence rate.\nGradient Averaging: Closely related to momentum is using the sample average of all previous gradients, xk+1 = xk \u2212 \u03b1kk \u2211k j=1 f \u2032 ij (xj),\nwhich is similar to the SAG iteration in the form (5) but where all previous gradients are used. This approach is used in the dual averaging method Nesterov [2009], and while this averaging procedure leads to convergence for a constant step size and can improve the constants in the convergence rate Xiao [2010], it does not improve on the O(1/k) rate.\nIterate Averaging: Rather than averaging the gradients, some authors use the basic SG iteration but take an average over xk values. With a suitable choice of step-sizes, this gives the same asymptotic efficiency as Newton-like second-order SG methods and also leads to increased robustness of the convergence rate to the exact sequence of step sizes Polyak and Juditsky [1992]. Baher\u2019s method [Kushner and Yin, 2003, \u00a71.3.4] combines gradient averaging with online iterate averaging, and also displays appealing asymptotic properties. The epoch SG method uses averaging to obtain the O(1/k) rate even for non-smooth objectives Hazan and Kale [2011]. However, the convergence rates of these averaging methods remain sublinear.\nStochastic versions of FG methods: Various options are available to accelerate the convergence of the FG method for smooth functions, such as the accelerated full gradient (AFG) method Nesterov [1983], as well as classical techniques based on quadratic approximations such as non-linear conjugate gradient, quasi-Newton, and Hessian-free Newton methods. Several authors have analyzed stochastic variants of these algorithms Schraudolph [1999], Sunehag et al. [2009], Ghadimi and Lan [2010], Martens [2010], Xiao [2010]. Under certain conditions these variants are convergent with an O(1/k) rate Sunehag et al. [2009]. Alternately, if we split the convergence rate into a deterministic and stochastic part, these methods can improve the dependency on the deterministic part Ghadimi and Lan [2010], Xiao [2010]. However, as with all other methods we have discussed thus far in this section, we are not aware of any existing method of this flavor that improves on the O(1/k) rate.\nConstant step size: If the SG iterations are used with a constant step size (rather than a decreasing sequence), then the convergence rate of the method can be split into two parts [Nedic and Bertsekas, 2000, Proposition 2.4], where the first part depends on k and converges linearly to 0 and the second part is independent of k but does not converge to 0. Thus, with a constant step size the SG iterations have a linear convergence rate up to some tolerance, and in general after this point the iterations do not make further progress. Indeed, convergence of the basic SG method with a constant step size has only been shown under extremely strong assumptions about the relationship between the functions fi Solodov [1998]. This contrasts with the method we present in this work which converges to the optimal solution using a constant step size and does so with a linear rate (without additional assumptions).\nAccelerated methods: Accelerated SG methods, which despite their name are not related to the aforementioned AFG method, take advantage of the fast convergence rate of SG methods with a constant step size. In particular, accelerated SG methods use a constant step size by default, and only decrease the step size on iterations where the inner-product between successive gradient estimates is negative Kesten [1958], Delyon and Juditsky [1993]. This leads to convergence of the method and allows it to potentially achieve periods of linear convergence where the step size stays constant. However, the overall convergence rate of the method remains sublinear.\nHybrid Methods: Some authors have proposed variants of the SG method for problems of the form (1) that seek to gradually transform the iterates into the FG method in order to achieve a linear convergence rate. Bertsekas proposes to go through the data cyclically with a specialized weighting that allows the method to achieve a linear convergence rate for strongly-convex quadratic\nfunctions Bertsekas [1997]. However, the weighting is numerically unstable and the linear convergence rate treats full passes through the data as iterations. A related strategy is to group the fi functions into \u2018batches\u2019 of increasing size and perform SG iterations on the batches Friedlander and Schmidt [2012]. In both cases, the iterations that achieve the linear rate have a cost that is not independent of n, as opposed to SAG.\nIncremental Aggregated Gradient: Finally, Blatt et al. presents the most closely-related algorithm, the IAG method Blatt et al. [2007]. This method is identical to the SAG iteration (5), but uses a cyclic choice of ik rather than sampling the ik values. This distinction has several important consequences. In particular, Blatt et al. are only able to show that the convergence rate is linear for strongly-convex quadratic functions (without deriving an explicit rate), and their analysis treats full passes through the data as iterations. Using a non-trivial extension of their analysis and a proof technique involving bounding the gradients and iterates simultaneously by a Lyapunov potential function, in this work we give an explicit linear convergence rate for general strongly-convex functions using the SAG iterations that only examine a single training example. Further, as our analysis and experiments show, when the number of training examples is sufficiently large, the SAG iterations achieve a linear convergence rate under a much larger set of step sizes than the IAG method. This leads to more robustness to the selection of the step size and also, if suitably chosen, leads to a faster convergence rate and improved practical performance. We also emphasize that in our experiments IAG and the basic FG method perform similarly, while SAG performs much better, showing that the simple change (random selection vs. cycling) can dramatically improve optimization performance."}, {"heading": "3 Convergence Analysis", "text": "In our analysis we assume that each function fi in (1) is differentiable and that each gradient f \u2032 i is Lipschitz-continuous with constant L, meaning that for all x and y in Rp we have\n\u2016f \u2032i(x)\u2212 f \u2032i(y)\u2016 \u2264 L\u2016x\u2212 y\u2016.\nThis is a fairly weak assumption on the fi functions, and in cases where the fi are twice-differentiable it is equivalent to saying that the eigenvalues of the Hessians of each fi are bounded above by L. In addition, we also assume that the average function g = 1n \u2211n i=1 fi is strongly-convex with constant \u00b5 > 0, meaning that the function x 7\u2192 g(x) \u2212 \u00b52 \u2016x\u2016 2 is convex. This is a stronger assumption and is not satisfied by all machine learning models. However, note that in machine learning we are typically free to choose the regularizer, and we can always add an `2-regularization term as in Eq. (2) to transform any convex problem into a strongly-convex problem (in this case we have \u00b5 \u2265 \u03bb). Note that strong-convexity implies that the problem is solvable, meaning that there exists some unique x\u2217 that achieves the optimal function value. Our convergence results assume that we initialize y0i to a zero vector for all i, and our results depend on the variance of the gradient norms at the optimum x\u2217, denoted by \u03c32 = 1n \u2211 i \u2016f \u2032i(x\u2217)\u20162. Finally, all our convergence results consider expectations with respect to the internal randomization of the algorithm, and not with respect to the data (which are assumed to be deterministic and fixed).\nWe first consider the convergence rate of the method when using a constant step size of \u03b1k = 1\n2nL , which is similar to the step size needed for convergence of the IAG method in practice.\nProposition 1 With a constant step size of \u03b1k = 1 2nL , the SAG iterations satisfy for k \u2265 1:\nE [ \u2016xk \u2212 x\u2217\u20162 ] 6 (\n1\u2212 \u00b5 8Ln\n)k[ 3\u2016x0 \u2212 x\u2217\u20162 + 9\u03c32\n4L2\n] .\nThe proof is given in the Appendix. Note that the SAG iterations also trivially obtain the O(1/k) rate achieved by SG methods, since(\n1\u2212 \u00b5 8Ln\n)k 6 exp ( \u2212 k\u00b5\n8Ln\n) 6 8Ln\nk\u00b5 = O(n/k),\nalbeit with a constant which is proportional to n. Despite this constant, they are advantageous over SG methods in later iterations because they obtain an exponential convergence rate as in FG methods. We also note that an exponential convergence rate is obtained for any constant step size smaller than 12nL .\nIn terms of passes through the data, the rate in Proposition 1 is similar to that achieved by the basic FG method. However, our next result shows that, if the number of training examples is slightly larger than L/\u00b5 (which will often be the case, as discussed in Section 6), then the SAG iterations can use a larger step size and obtain a better convergence rate that is independent of \u00b5 and L (see proof in the Appendix).\nProposition 2 If n > 8L\u00b5 , with a step size of \u03b1k = 1 2n\u00b5 the SAG iterations satisfy for k > n:\nE [ g(xk)\u2212 g(x\u2217) ] 6 C ( 1\u2212 1\n8n\n)k ,\nwith C =\n[ 16L\n3n \u2016x0 \u2212 x\u2217\u20162 + 4\u03c3\n2\n3n\u00b5\n( 8 log ( 1 + \u00b5n\n4L\n) + 1 )] .\nWe state this result for k > n because we assume that the first n iterations of the algorithm use an SG method and that we initialize the subsequent SAG iterations with the average of the iterates, which leads to an O((log n)/k) rate. In contrast, using the SAG iterations from the beginning gives the same rate but with a constant proportional to n. Note that this bound is obtained when initializing all yi to zero after the SG phase.\n1 However, in our experiments we do not use the SG initialization but rather use a minor variant of SAG (discussed in the next section), which appears more difficult to analyze but which gives better performance.\nIt is interesting to compare this convergence rate with the known convergence rates of first-order methods [Nesterov, 2004, see \u00a72]. For example, if we take n = 100000, L = 100, and \u00b5 = 0.01 then the basic FG method has a rate of ((L\u2212 \u00b5)/(L+ \u00b5))2 = 0.9996 and the \u2018optimal\u2019 AFG method has a faster rate of (1 \u2212 \u221a \u00b5/L) = 0.9900. In contrast, running n iterations of SAG has a much faster rate of (1\u2212 1/8n)n = 0.8825 using the same number of evaluations of f \u2032i . Further, the lower-bound for a black-box first-order method is (( \u221a L\u2212\u221a\u00b5)/( \u221a L+ \u221a \u00b5))2 = 0.9608, indicating that SAG can be substantially faster than any FG method that does not use the structure of the problem.2 In the Appendix, we compare Propositions 1 and 2 to the rates of primal and dual FG and coordinate-wise methods for the special case of `2-regularized leasts squares.\nEven though n appears in the convergence rate, if we perform n iterations of SAG (i.e., one effective pass through the data), the error is multiplied by (1 \u2212 1/8n)n \u2264 exp(\u22121/8), which is independent of n. Thus, each pass through the data reduces the excess cost by a constant multiplicative factor that is independent of the problem, as long as n > 8L/\u00b5. Further, while the step size in Proposition 2 depends on \u00b5 and n, we can obtain the same convergence rate by using a step size as large as \u03b1k = 1 16L . This is because the proposition is true for all values of \u00b5 satisfying \u00b5 L > 8 n , so we can choose the smallest possible value of \u00b5 = 8Ln . We have observed in practice that the IAG method\n1While it may appear suboptimal to not use the gradients computed during the n iterations of stochastic gradient descent, using them only improves the bound by a constant.\n2Note that L in the SAG rates is based on the f \u2032i functions, while in the FG methods it is based on g \u2032 which can\nbe much smaller.\nwith a step size of \u03b1k = 1\n2n\u00b5 may diverge, even under these assumptions. Thus, for certain problems the SAG iterations can tolerate a much larger step size, which leads to increased robustness to the selection of the step size. Further, as our analysis and experiments indicate, the ability to use a large step size leads to improved performance of the SAG iterations.\nWhile we have stated Proposition 1 in terms of the iterates and Proposition 2 in terms of the function values, the rates obtained on iterates and function values are equivalent because, by the Lipschitz and strong-convexity assumptions, we have \u00b52 \u2016x k \u2212 x\u2217\u20162 6 g(xk)\u2212 g(x\u2217) 6 L2 \u2016x k \u2212 x\u2217\u20162."}, {"heading": "4 Implementation Details", "text": "In this section we describe modifications that substantially reduce the SAG iteration\u2019s memory requirements, as well as modifications that lead to better practical performance.\nStructured gradients: For many problems the storage cost of O(np) for the yki vectors is prohibitive, but we can often use structure in the f \u2032i to reduce this cost. For example, many loss functions fi take the form fi(a T i x) for a vector ai. Since ai is constant, for these problems we only need to store the scalar f \u2032ik(u k i ) for u k i = a T ik xk rather than the full gradient aTi f \u2032 i(u k i ), reducing the storage cost to O(n). Further, because of the simple form of the SAG updates, if ai is sparse we can use \u2018lazy updates\u2019 in order to reduce the iteration cost from O(p) down to the sparsity level of ai.\nMini-batches: To employ vectorization and parallelism, practical SG implementations often group training examples into \u2018mini-batches\u2019 and perform SG iterations on the mini-batches. We can also use mini-batches within the SAG iterations, and for problems with dense gradients this decreases the storage requirements of the algorithm since we only need a yki for each mini-batch. Thus, for example, using mini-batches of size 100 leads to a 100-fold reduction in the storage cost.\nStep-size re-weighting: On early iterations of the SAG algorithm, when most yki are set to the uninformative zero vector, rather than dividing \u03b1k in (5) by n we found it was more effective to divide by m, the number of unique ik values that we have sampled so far (which converges to n). This modification appears more difficult to analyze, but with this modification we found that the SAG algorithm outperformed the SG/SAG hybrid algorithm analyzed in Proposition 2.\nExact regularization: For regularized objectives like (2) we can use the exact gradient of the regularizer, rather than approximating it. For example, our experiments on `2-regularized optimization problems used the recursion\nd\u2190 d\u2212 yi, yi \u2190 l\u2032i(xk), d\u2190 d+ yi, x\u2190 ( 1\u2212 \u03b1\u03bb ) x\u2212 \u03b1\nm d . (7)\nThis can be implemented efficiently for sparse data sets by using the representation x = \u03baz, where \u03ba is a scalar and z is a vector, since the update based on the regularizer simply updates \u03ba.\nLarge step sizes: Proposition 1 requires \u03b1k 6 1/2Ln while under an additional assumption Proposition 2 allows \u03b1k 6 1/16L. In practice we observed better performance using step sizes of \u03b1k = 1/L and \u03b1k = 2/(L + n\u00b5). These step sizes seem to work even when the additional assumption of Proposition 2 is not satisfied, and we conjecture that the convergence rates under these step sizes are much faster than the rate obtained in Proposition 1 for the general case.\nLine search: Since L is generally not known, we experimented with a basic line-search, where we start with an initial estimate L0, and we double this estimate whenever we do not satisfy the instantiated Lipschitz inequality\nfik(x k \u2212 (1/Lk)f \u2032ik(x k)) 6 fik(x k)\u2212 1 2Lk \u2016f \u2032ik(x k)\u20162.\nTo avoid instability caused by comparing very small numbers, we only do this test when \u2016f \u2032ik(x k)\u20162 > 10\u22128. To allow the algorithm to potentially achieve a faster rate due to a higher degree of local smoothness, we multiply Lk by 2 (\u22121/n) after each iteration."}, {"heading": "5 Experimental Results", "text": "Our experiments compared an extensive variety of competitive FG and SG methods.

If we can afford to do many passes through the data (say, several hundred), then an FG method should be used.\n3http://www.di.ens.fr/~mschmidt/Software/minFunc.html\nWe expect that the SAG iterations will be most useful between these two extremes, where we can afford to do more than one pass through the data but cannot afford to do enough passes to warrant using FG algorithms like L-BFGS. To test whether this is indeed the case on real data sets, we performed experiments on a set of freely available benchmark binary classification data sets. The quantum (p = 50000, p = 78) and protein (n = 145751, p = 74) data set was obtained from the KDD Cup 2004 website,4 the sido data set was obtained from the Causality Workbench website,5 while the rcv1 (n = 20242, p = 47236) and covertype (n = 581012, p = 54) data sets were obtained from the LIBSVM data website.6 Although our method can be applied to any differentiable function, on these data sets we focus on the `2-regularized logistic regression problem, with \u03bb = 1/n. We split each dataset in two, training on one half and testing on the other half. We added a (regularized) bias term to all data sets, and for dense features we standardized so that they would have a mean of zero and a variance of one. We measure the training and testing costs as a function of the number of effective passes through the data, measured as the number of f \u2032i evaluations divided by n. These results are thus independent of the practical implementation of the algorithms. We plot the training and testing costs of the different methods for 30 effective passes through the data in Figure 1.\nIn our second series of experiments, we sought to test whether SG methods (or the IAG method) with a very carefully chosen step size would be competitive with the SAG iterations. In particular, we compared the following variety of basic FG and SG methods.\n1. FG: The full gradient method described by iteration (3).\n2. AFG: The accelerated full gradient method Nesterov [1983], where iterations of (3) are interleaved with an extrapolation step.\n3. peg: The pegasos algorithm of Shalev-Shwartz et al. [2007], but where we multiply the step size by a constant.\n4. SG: The stochastic gradient method described by iteration (4), where we use a constant stepsize.\n5. ASG: The stochastic gradient method described by iteration (4), where we use a constant step size and average the iterates.7\n6. IAG: The incremental aggregated gradient method of Blatt et al. [2007] described by iteration (5) but with a cyclic choice of ik.\n7. SAG: The proposed stochastic average gradient method described by iteration (5).\nFor all of the above methods, we chose the step size that gave the best performance among powers of 10. On the full data sets, we compare these methods to each other and to the L-BFGS and the SAG-LS algorithms from the previous experiment in Figure 2, which also shows the selected step sizes.\nWe can observe several trends across these experiments:\n\u2013 FG vs. SG: Although the performance of SG methods can be catastrophic if the step size is not chosen carefully (e.g., the quantum and covertype data), with a carefully-chosen step-size\n4http://osmot.cs.cornell.edu/kddcup 5 http://www.causality.inf.ethz.ch/home.php 6 http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets 7We have also compared to a variety of other SG methods, such as SG with momentum, SG with gradient averaging, accelerated SG, and using SG but delaying averaging until after the first effective pass. However, none of these SG methods performed better than the ASG method above so we omit them to keep the plots simple.\nthe SG methods always do substantially better than FG methods on the first few passes through the data. In contrast, the adaptive FG methods in the first experiment are not sensitive to the step size and because of its steady progress the best FG method (L-BFGS) always eventually passes the SG methods.\n\u2013 (FG and SG) vs. SAG: The SAG iterations seem to achieve the best of both worlds. They start out substantially better than FG methods, but continue to make steady (linear) progress which leads to better performance than SG methods. The significant speed-up observed for SAG in reaching low training costs often also seems to translate into reaching the optimal testing cost more quickly than the other methods. We also note that the proposed line-search seems to perform as well or better than choosing the optimal fixed step-size in hind sight.\n\u2013 IAG vs. SAG: The second experiment shows that the IAG method performs similarly to the regular FG method, and they also show the surprising result that the randomized SAG method outperforms the closely-related deterministic IAG method by a very large margin. This is due to the larger step sizes used by the SAG iterations, which would cause the IAG iterations to diverge."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion", "text": "Optimal regularization strength: One might wonder if the additional hypothesis in Proposition 2 is satisfied in practice. In a learning context, where each function fi is the loss associated to a single data point, L is equal to the largest value of the loss second derivative \u03be (1 for the square loss, 1/4 for the logistic loss) times R2, where R is a the uniform bound on the norm of each data point. Thus, the constraint \u00b5L > 8 n is satisfied when \u03bb > 8\u03beR2\nn . In low-dimensional settings, the optimal regularization parameter is of the form C/n Liang et al. [2009] where C is a scalar constant, and may thus violate the constraint. However, the improvement with respect to regularization parameters of\nthe form \u03bb = C/ \u221a n is known to be asymptotically negligible, and in any case in such low-dimensional settings, regular stochastic or batch gradient descent may be efficient enough in practice. In the more interesting high-dimensional settings where the dimension p of our covariates is not small compared to the sample size n, then all theoretical analyses we are aware of advocate settings of \u03bb which satisfy this constraint. For example, Sridharan et al. [2008] considers parameters of the form \u03bb = C\u221a\nn in the parametric setting, while Eberts and Steinwart [2011] considers \u03bb = C n\u03b2 with \u03b2 < 1\nin a non-parametric setting.\nTraining cost vs. testing cost: The theoretical contribution of this work is limited to the convergence rate of the training cost. Though there are several settings where this is the metric of interest (e.g., variational inference in graphical models), in many cases one will be interested in the convergence speed of the testing cost. Since the O(1/k) convergence rate of the testing cost, achieved by SG methods with decreasing step sizes (and a single pass through the data), is provably optimal when the algorithm only accesses the function through unbiased measurements of the objective and its gradient, it is unlikely that one can obtain a linear convergence rate for the testing cost with the SAG iterations. However, as shown in our experiments, the testing cost of the SAG iterates often reaches its minimum quicker than existing SG methods, and we could expect to improve the constant in the O(1/k) convergence rate, as is the case with online second-order methods Bottou and Bousquet [2007].\nStep-size selection and termination criteria: The three major disadvantages of SG methods are: (i) the slow convergence rate, (ii) deciding when to terminate the algorithm, and (iii) choosing the step size while running the algorithm. This paper showed that the SAG iterations achieve a much faster convergence rate, but the SAG iterations may also be advantageous in terms of tuning step sizes and designing termination criteria. In particular, the SAG iterations suggest a natural termination criterion; since the average of the yki variables converges to g\n\u2032(xk) as \u2016xk \u2212 xk\u22121\u2016 converges to zero, we can use (1/n)\u2016 \u2211 i y k i \u2016 as an approximation of the optimality of xk. Further, while SG methods require specifying a sequence of step sizes and mispecifying this sequence can have a disastrous effect on the convergence rate [Nemirovski et al., 2009, \u00a72.1], our theory shows that the SAG iterations iterations achieve a linear convergence rate for any sufficiently small constant step size and our experiments indicate that a simple line-search gives strong performance."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "Nicolas Le Roux, Mark Schmidt, and Francis Bach are supported by the European Research Council (SIERRA-ERC-239993).

While this does not affect the linear convergence of the algorithm, the bound we obtain for the first few passes through the data is the O(1/k) rate one would get using stochastic gradient descent, but with a constant proportional to n. This problem can be alleviated for the second bound by running stochastic gradient descent for a few iterations before running the SAG algorithm.
