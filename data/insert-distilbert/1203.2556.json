INTRODUCTION\nNowadays, the need for appropriate planned power systems to reduce generation cost, minimize the consumer cost and improve the quality of the power supply has become imperative [1]-[3]. As a result, transmission expansion planning (TEP) is gaining more significance. A sub-\n1 N.Gupta and P. K.

Shekhar is with the Department of Material Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, 208016, UP, India (e-mail:\nvidtan@iitk.ac.in).\noptimally planned transmission network may lead to unutilized generation capacities, demand not served, and even over investment. This is particularly important, for example, in India where the transmission capacity has to be increased significantly, primarily to keep pace with the expected 11% growth in generation [4]. Previous studies [5]-[8] have identified important issues pertaining to network planning: (i) optimal locations of new transmission lines, (ii) up-gradation of existing transmission lines, and (iii) optimal capacity of the proposed transmission lines.\nTraditionally, the deterministic N-1/N-2 contingency planning methodology has been used for TEP. However, it cannot account for the probabilistic nature of generation and transmission equipment failures, resulting in an under/ over designed transmission system. A powerful methodology used in \u201cstochastic\u201d TEP has been a combination of i) optimization, ii) probability theory, (iii) Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and iv) graph theory [3], [9]-[11]. Here, new transmission lines were identified based on the optimization of the total costs.\nSu and Li [12], [13] minimized the sum of EDNS and transmission investment costs to determine new transmission lines. MCS was used to characterize the stochastic nature of the transmission lines and generation failure, while graph theory, or more specifically, the min-cut max-flow algorithm [14], was used to calculate EDNS. The approach of Choi et al. [15] was similar to that of Su and Li [12] except for the fact that reliability criteria were used as a constraint, while minimizing the investment costs. Akbari et al. [16] presented a TEP methodology using probabilistic selection of loads. However, they did not account for the multiple stochastic failures of generation and transmission equipments.\nRecent papers on TEP [17], [18] have incorporated load-flow analysis -- instead of min-cut max-flow approach \u2013 to compute EDNS/ EENS using the load-curtailment strategy. This process requires multiple load flow calculations to compute DNS for one network configuration.\nConsequently, deterministic contingency criteria were used instead of probabilistic MCS contingency criteria. In their general review of TEP methodologies, Shahidepour [3], Latorre et al. [9] and Lee et al. [10] have advocated the use of i) social welfare, ii) scenario analysis, and iii) trade-off between economics and reliability of the power systems for designing networks.\nThe approach followed by previous investigations [1]-[18] have several shortcomings. First, the capacity of all possible new transmission lines were specified a priori. Second, the network modeling and related computations in graph theory do not follow electrical laws. In fact, application of DC-load flow and suggested EDNS calculation approach on the optimized network presented in [12], showed that the EDNS was 165 MW compared to 48 MW calculated using the min-cut max-flow method. Third, the scenario analysis based on the load curve should be integrated with TEP to avoid overinvestment 3 . Fourth, the economic dispatch of generators is not followed in the graph theory approach. Fifth, the concept of social welfare has not been incorporated. For example, non-zero EDNS also implies unutilized generation capacity or expected generation not served (EGNS), the cost of which must be accounted for in TEP. Similarly, the cost associated with wheeling losses (WL) should be incorporated.\nThe major objective of this investigation has been to develop a probabilistic methodology for TEP which captures the realities of a transmission system, as mentioned in the previous paragraph. The proposed methodology is illustrated through a case study. The paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 presents the TEP methodology in detail, which includes discussions on the load flow analysis for calculation of EDNS and roulette wheel methodology for determining the capacities of new transmission lines. The detailed algorithm of the proposed methodology is given in section 3. Results of the implementation of the TEP methodology in a\n3 For deterministic planning such as N\u20101, it may be reasonable to use the peak load level to justify transmission requirement due to the less stringent consideration of system contingency scenarios. However, for probabilistic planning through MCS, not accounting for the LDC may result in extreme values of EDNS and EGNS.\nmodified IEEE 5-bus system are given in Section 4.\n2. METHODOLOGY\nThe proposed methodology involves: (i) minimization of the sum of the investment, EDNS, EGNS and EWL costs to put together economic and reliability analysis on a single platform, (ii) incorporating contingency analysis using MCS, (iii) merit order dispatch of generators, (iv) DCload flow analysis, (v) Kirchhoff\u201fs law to determine EDNS/EGNS in the electrical network, and (vi) roulette wheel selection method to calculate the optimum capacity of the transmission lines. Implicit in the proposed methodology is the concept of social welfare because the interests of the consumers, generators and transmission operators have been accounted for simultaneously. The overall methodology has been implemented on a modified IEEE 5-bus test system (see Fig. 1) with the following assumptions:\n1) The demand at all buses is defined by the load curve LDC. To incorporate seasonal\nvariation of demand, the monthly LDC, in terms of the average monthly demand, has been adopted. Thus there are total of 12 possible load scenarios [19]. 2) New generators are present at buses 6 and 7 and generator at bus 1 is taken as slack\ngenerator [12].\n3) FOR of all generators are specified [12]. At least two of generators should be online to\ninject power into the network 4 .\n4) All the probable new transmission lines are known a priori [12], while the capacity of the\nnew transmission lines would be calculated by the planning procedure.\n5) Length, impedance and FOR of transmission lines are specified [12]. 6) The investment costs of lines, generators and the EDNS costs are taken from [12], [13].\n2.1. Objective Function\nThe objective function J includes a sum of the total expected cost resulting from DNS, GNS,\nWL and investment for setting up the new transmission lines and generation capacities:\nJ=EC + Tinv +Ginv (1)\nEC = EDNScost + EGNScost + EWLcost (2)\nWhere, Tinv and Ginv are respectively the investment in setting up transmission lines and generators. The constraints related to the objective function are:\n1 1 ( ) ( ) 0\nNG ND g d g d G t D t     \n(3)\n1\n1 ( )\nb\ns j s\nj sj\nP x     \n(4)\nEquation (3) ensures a balance between supply and demand, while equation (4) represents the DC-load flow formulation whose solution provides the power flow in all transmission lines. The definition of the terms in equations (1) and (2) are given below:\nEDNScost\n12\n1 ( ) *730 ( )EDNS t tC EDNS t   \n(5)\n4 In general, the minimum number of online generators is a function of the network size.\nEGNScost\n( )\n1\n12\n1\n( )* ( )\n730 * ( )\nEGNS\ng\nrl s s\ns\nt\nC t EGNS t\nC EGO t  \n\n          \n(6)\nEWLcost\n12\n1 ( ) *730 ( )EWL t tC EWL t    (7)\nIn equations (5) to (7), 730 refers to the number of hours in a month. EGO(t)s indicates expected outage when a generator at bus s is cut-off from the network during the simulations. In contrast, EGNS refers to unutilized generation capacity from generators connected to the network. CEDNS, CEGNS, CEWL, Crl(s)are the costs of EDNS, EGNS, EWL, and revenue loss of sth generator due to outage respectively, in units of k$/MWh respectively. The transmission and generation investment costs can be calculated from the following equations:\n2( )1( ) 1 1\n** * * n T\ninv T p\nN N\nq p pT q q p\np T C OCFC TL TL F\n \n  \n(8)\n12\n1( ) 2( )\n1 1\n* 730 * G G\nG\nNG\ninv G N N G NG NG\nk N k t G C GC C PG       \n(9)\nCT1(q) is the capital investment cost of q th transmission line [13], achieved by curve fitting\nCT1(q)=0.35* Fq + 0.19 (10)\nand TLq is the length of q th transmission line (km), NT denotes total number of transmission lines in the network, Nn represents number of new transmission lines, Fq belongs to the capacity of q th transmission line (MW), Fp is the capacity of p th transmission line (MW), and CT2 is the annual operating and maintenance cost of line (k$/MW/km).

Calculation of DNS, GNS, and WL\nFirst a DC-load flow is run on the electrical network with the specified demand at each node (DS) assuming that all transmission lines do not have capacity constraints. DNS at each node (DNSs) is then calculated using the procedure given below.\nAssume there are \u201cm\u201d lines carrying power in to node \u201cs\u201d and \u201cn\u201d lines taking power out away\nfrom node \u201cs\u201d. DNSs and GNSs are defined as (see Fig. 2):\nmin , min , , , , , , , , ,\n1 1 s s s\nm n DIFF D T T T T G\nf i s c i s f j s c j s i j                          \n(11)\nDNSs = DIFFs : if DIFFs > 0 (12) GNSs = abs(DIFFs) : if DIFFs < 0 (13)\nWhere, Ds and Gs respectively stand for demand and generation at bus s, Tf,i,s and Tf,j,s are the\nflow on i th incoming and j th\noutgoing transmission line respectively connected to bus s, and Tc,i,s\nand Tc,j,s respectively the transmission capacity of i th incoming and j th outgoing transmission line\nconnected to bus s. Where the system DNS 6 and GNS are calculated as\nDNS = 1\nb\ns DNSs   and GNS = 1\nb\ns GNSs  \n(14)\nClearly GNSs is applicable to either a pure generator or a mixed (generator + demand) bus. The above concept can be understood by the example shown in Fig. 3, where, for example, 25.15/100 refers to power flow of 25.15 MW between buses 1 and 2, through a 100 MW capacity transmission line. Fig. 3 shows that two transmission lines connected from bus-1 to bus3 and from bus-3 to bus-4 are overloaded. In fact, the overloading affects the power injection at generation bus as well as demand served at load buses. DNSs and GNSs computed by equation (11), (12) and (13) are shown in Table-II.\nFrom the above table it can be observed that GNS is equal to the DNS in the network. The computed GNSs and DNSs are only associated with those buses which are connected to the power system through constrained transmission lines. The GNSs at bus can be defined as the loss to generators, which has to shutdown due to constrained network. Wheeling loss is computed by considering power flow in congested lines:\n, , ( )f k c k k Congested WL T T   \n(15)\nWhere, Tf,k is the power flow and Tc,k is the capacity of the k th congested transmission line.\nThe aggregated wheeling loss is the sum of wheeling loss on all k congested transmission lines. As shown in Fig. 3, transmission lines between buses 1 and 3 and buses 3 and 4 are congested and demand more capacity to wheel power. Thus, the WL in the example system given in Fig. 3, is (27.85+15.83=43.68 MW). Multiplication of WL with cost of wheeling per MW is cost of wheeling loss belongs to the transmission system owner. The computations of DNS, GNS and WL are repeated multiple times for different demand scenarios and contingencies generated by MCS. Thus, from the distributions of DNS, GNS and WL the associated EDNS, EGNS and EWL are calculated. Equation (16) defines EDNS:\n*\nb\ni i i dDNS EDNS DNS dp    (16)\nHere, DNSi represents i th sample of the distribution of DNS and pdi belongs to probability of occurrence of DNSi. The definitions of EGNS and EWL are similar to that of EDNS as shown in equation (16), with DNSi being replaced by GNSi and WLi and their corresponding probabilities respectively.\n2.3. Monte Carlo simulation\nIn Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), random variables are drawn separately for each of the\ntransmission lines under consideration. All lines with variable values between FOR and 1 are retained for power transmission. If the value of the variable is between 0 and FOR then the line is assigned \u201czero\u201d capacity, that is, it is omitted from the network. Subsequently, the reduced network is used for calculating DNS and GNS.\nDuring MCS, situations may arise which can lead to (i) the isolation of a demand bus or/and (ii) the specified power not being evacuated from a generator, resulting in \u201cgeneration not served.\u201d An example of such a case is show in Fig. 3, where the generation at buses 1 and 2 match the sum of the loads at buses 3, 4, and 5. If the transmission lines connected to bus 2-4, bus 2-5, and bus 3-4 are removed during MCS, the demand buses 4 and 5 are isolated from the network. This also results in a situation where the total generation does not match the total demand in the network, which in turn, is not amenable to power flow analysis for calculating DNS and GNS. To ensure that these situations are eliminated from consideration, the following constraints are imposed:\n0 < DNS(t) < D(t) or DNS(t)s < D(t)s (17) 0 < GNS(t) < G(t) or GNS(t)s < G(t)s (18)\nIn equation (17) and (18), D and G refer to total demand and total generation in the network\nrespectively, where t 7 represents the time instant for which simulation is carried out.\n2.4. Roulette Wheel\nAfter each DC-load flow run, all congested lines, where power flow is greater than their respective transmission capacities, are assigned the value 1. Non-congested lines are assigned a value of 0. The probability of congestion of each transmission line in the network is computed, while after each DC-load flow run after contingency\n7 This is associated with the time instant of load curve, in our simulation 12 time points are taken to encounter 12 load scenarios.\n1,\n,\nj\ncon j\nMCS\nN P\nN  (19)\nWhere, Pcon,j is the probability of congestion and N1,j is the number of \u201c1\u201d for the j th line.\nNow, an imaginary roulette wheel [21], [22] is constructed where each transmission line in the network is represented by a separate segment. The area of the segment corresponding to each transmission line is proportional to its probability of congestion. The wheel is rotated N times, where N is the number of transmission lines having a congestion probability greater than 0.1\u2013 both existing and proposed -- in the network. At the end of each rotation, the segment at which the pointer stops, and the corresponding transmission line, is noted. The capacity of each transmission line at the end of N rotations is updated according to\njj o jj FmFF  (20)\nWhere, Fj 0 is the base capacity of the j th transmission line, mj is the number of times out of N that the roulette pointer stops at the segment corresponding to the j th\ntransmission line and jF is the\nvalue by which the transmission capacity is increased in the j th transmission line.\nIt is important to ensure that the transmission capacities are not over-specified because it would result in superfluous investment. That is, the transmission capacities should be such that it can withstand a reasonable level of overloading without affecting system stability and security. In contingency states, overloading of transmission lines for short-term emergency rating can be tolerated by a factor of 1.1 to 2 from the nominal rating, and for long-term emergency rating the value of factor can be from 1.05 to 1.8 [23]. These levels of overloading can be handled for 15 to 30 minutes by the safety instruments and load shedding strategies. In our calculations, we have specified a maximum overloading of 10%. Consequently, the process of capacity updating of a transmission line \u2013elaborated in a later section \u2013 is terminated, once the probability of\ncongestion goes below 0.1. After the roulette wheel is rotated NT times, the marginal expected cost (MEC) and marginal investment (MI) are calculated from equation (21) and (22) respectively:\n1\n, , 1\n( ) i i\nN N i N i\nMEC d EC EC EC\ndF F F\n\n\n \n \n(21)\nWhere, EC i is expected cost in i th iteration, EC i-1 is expected cost in (i-1) th iteration, FN is updated network capacity of the network in one complete simulation of roulette wheel selection and dFN is change in the capacity of the network\n1\n, , 1\n( ) i iinv inv inv\nN N i N i\nMEC d T T T\ndF F F\n\n\n \n \n(22)\nWhere, i invT is transmission investment in i th iteration 8 and 1i invT  is transmission investment in (i1) th iteration. When MEC equals MI, an optimal solution has been found where the total cost is minimized.\n3. ALGORITHM\nThe proposed probabilistic TEP algorithm is described below where Genetic algorithm (GA) is\nused as an optimization model [24], [25]:\n1) Generate initial population of chromosomes having the length equal to the set of proposed\nlines, where 1 and 0 represent the active and inactive lines respectively. All existing lines are automatically considered as active. 2) Take one chromosome from the population for simulation and assign a minimum\ntransmission capacity of 5 MW ( 0iF ) to each active proposed transmission line. Compute associated total investment.\n8 In the proposed methodology TEP is carried out after planning of generators thus generation investment in constant.\n3) Take scenario 1 out of 12 scenarios generated from LDC. 4) Generate a string by removing some transmission lines from the chromosome, as well as\ngenerate the string of off-line generators using MCS.\n5) Check islanding condition. If system is in islanding mode, go to Step 4. 6) If slack generator is removed during MCS, replace the slack generator with the next higher\ncapacity generator. Dispatch the generators according to merit-order dispatch to match the total demand.\n7) Run DC-load flow with remaining lines. Store the power flow in all active lines. 8) Go to step 4, and repeat for multiple contingencies (transmission and generation) in MCS. 9) Go to step 3, repeat for all scenarios generated from LDC. 10) Calculate EDNS, EGNS and EWL and the corresponding EC. 11) Compute the marginal expected cost (MEC) and marginal investment (MI). 12) If MEC is equal to MI, then go to step 18. 13) Compute the probability of congestion for each active line, using data from stored power\nflow data. Active lines with pcon,j \u2264 0.1 are not updated.\n14) Create roulette wheel with each active line having pcon,j \u2265 0.1. 15) Update transmission capacities according to procedure specified in section 2.4. jF is\ntaken as 5 MW 9 .\n16) Calculate the total investment cost in the updated network. 17) Go to step 10. 18) Go to step 2. 19) Apply GA and find the least cost solution using the objective function in equation (1).\n9 Smaller values of should give a more precise solution. Calculations show that changing from 5 MW to 1 MW affects EDNS and\nEGNS by only 10%.\nThe corresponding flow chart is shown in Fig. 4.\n4. CASE STUDY\nThe implementation of the intrinsic methodology has been carried out on the 5-Bus IEEE test system shown in Fig. 1. The proposed algorithm has been used to identify a set of optimal transmission lines and their respective capacities from the probable new transmission lines [12]. In Fig. 1, BD represents bus demand and TL represents the transmission line. The numbers in front of BD and TL represent the corresponding bus and transmission line numbers. Bus-6 and bus-7 are the new generator buses, while the bus-1 is the slack bus. Table II depicts both the existing (TL 1 to TL 7) and the possible new (TL 8 to TL 21) transmission lines. To find the optimal solution 450 generations for GA are carried out. In each generation 30 chromosomes have been taken. To encounter most of the contingencies in the planning process, 1000 iterations of MCS is carried out 10 . All existing transmission lines and alternative new lines with their initial capacities have given in Table II.\nThere are two possible options for TEP: (i) add only new transmission lines to the existing network and (ii) Upgrading capacity of existing lines in addition to putting up new lines. To determine which of the above two option yields the minimum cost, J, the TEP methodology outlined in section 2 was carried out with a single demand scenario [12]. Table II also shows the optimal set of new transmission lines and their associated capacities in NL column. Please note that here the existing transmission lines have not been updated. From Table II we can observe that the nine transmission lines are selected optimally with an EDNS/ EGNS of 71.43 MW, which is 17.85% of the total demand. The EWL is 84.26 MW. Calculations showed that further increase in the capacities of the new lines shown in Table II, column NL did not significantly change EDNS and EWL.\n10 From the simulations we have observed that for the given network, 1000 iterations of MCS result are sufficient for convergence. In reality,\nthe number of iterations depends on the number of transmission lines (existing as well as new) in the power system.\nThis suggests that further reduction in EDNS, EGNS and EWL is possible only by removing congestion in the existing lines. For example, consider bus-2 in Fig. 1. Here we can see that congestion in lines TL-3 and TL-4 cannot be removed by increasing capacity of TL-13. Consequently, simulations have also been carried out for the scenario where all lines in the network, both the existing and the new probable lines, were considered for capacity up-\n11 Updated capacity of the network without updating of old lines. 12 Updated capacity of the network including updating of old lines. 13 Initial capacity of all lines is taken 5 MW. 14 Since generator capital investment is constant thus does not show in J.\ngradation. Column WEL in Table II shows results when all lines, both existing and new lines, are considered for capacity up-gradation. A comparison of column NL and WEL in Table-II shows that EDNS has been reduced by 71% to 20.7 MW, which, in turn, is 5.2% of the total demand. Similarly, there is a 69% reduction in EWL. The reduction in EDNS and EWL has primarily been due to the higher capacities of six out of the seven existing lines. At this point we can conclude that the achieved result is economic with an acceptable reliability level, where a 16.06% increase in the network investment (Tinv) has reduced the EC by 70.05% (thus objective function, J by 25.4%). Detailed simulations with the LDC have therefore been carried out by updating old lines along with new lines. Updating of old lines may be either through reconductering or adding parallel lines. Parallel transmission lines improve the reliability of the electrical network; parallel lines are proposed where the capacity approximately doubles.\nFor relatively lower capacity update, upgrading of the existing line conductor is preferable due to economics of the power systems. Table-III compares transmission expansion between the deterministic N-2/N-1 and the probabilistic MCS contingency methodologies. Here it is noted that N-1 and N-2 planning is carried out for peak demand scenarios while MCS follows average load curve. As expected, a comparison of columns of Tables III shows that for N-1 and N-2 based TEP, EDNS, EGNS, EWL and the overall costs are lower than TEP based on MCS. Of course, the extent of the difference will depend on the magnitude of EDNS, EGNS, and EWL costs vis-\u00e0-vis transmission investment costs. Because of the issue of cost versus reliability, an important question arises: Should TEP be based on MCS or N-1/N-2 contingency analyses? For developing countries such as India, where the realization of its economic growth potential is critically dependent on a reliable electricity supply network, TEP based on MCS may be the preferred methodology. The additional costs incurred in implementing this methodology will be\ncompensated several times over by the expected increase in the GDP. A rigorous analysis of this question, which will include congestion costs, will be the subject of a forthcoming paper\nA new methodology for transmission expansion planning that (i) does not require a priori specification of new/additional transmission capacities, (ii) uses the concept of social welfare, (iii) uses load flow and electrical laws to calculate EDNS, and (iv) incorporates the effect of seasonal variation through the LDC has been presented. Two new concepts have been introduced in this paper. First, load flow has been used to calculate DNS, compared to the conventional min-flow max-cut approach that does not necessarily follow electrical laws. Second, the roulette wheel model has been used to calculate the new/additional transmission\ncapacities. In fact, the roulette wheel methodology is applicable to both deterministic and probabilistic contingency analyses based TEP.\nSimulations show an important result: addition of only new transmission lines is not sufficient to minimize the magnitude of unfulfilled demand (EDNS). In fact, calculations show that a further 71% reduction in EDNS was possible primarily due to the capacity up-gradation of six out of the seven existing lines. Results also show that for N-1 and N-2 based TEP, which uses peak LDC, the overall costs are lower than the MCS based TEP, which uses the average LDC.\nTo make the proposed methodology more realistic, several important aspects of power system need to be included, for example, reactive power costs and costs related to carbon credits. Clearly, application of the proposed methodology for large networks can be cumbersome, which will be dealt with in a forthcoming paper. To reduce the computation time, a methodology would be proposed to (i) reduce the number of probable new transmission lines and (ii) replace multiple load flow by the generalized line outage distribution factor (GLODF)."}], "references": [{"title": "Electricity libralisation in the European Union: A progress report", "author": ["M.G.
