Such systems include measurements in environmental-sensors networks (Hill et al., 2009), localizations in robotics (Limketkai et al., 2005), and economic forecastings in finance (Niemira & Saaty, 2004). Once a relational model among variables is given, inference algorithms can solve value prediction problems and classification problems.\nAt a ground level, inference with a large number of continuous variables is non-trivial. Typically, inference is the task of calculating a marginal over variables of interest. Suppose that a market index has a relationship with n variables,\nrevenues of n banks. When marginalizing out the market index, the marginal is a function of n variables (revenues of banks), thus marginalizing out remaining variables becomes harder. When n grows, the computation becomes expensive. For example, when relations among variables follow Gaussian distributions, the computational complexity of the inference problem is O(|U|3) (U is a set of ground variables). Thus, the computation with such models is limited to moderate-size models, preventing its use in the many large, real-world applications.\nTo address these issues, Relational Probabilistic Languages (RPLs) (Ng & Subrahmanian, 1992; Koller & Pfeffer, 1997; Pfeffer et al., 1999; Friedman et al., 1999; Poole, 2003; de Salvo Braz et al., 2005; Richardson & Domingos, 2006; Milch & Russell, 2007; Getoor & Taskar, 2007) describe probability distributions at a relational level with the purpose of capturing larger models. RPLs combine probability theory for handling uncertainty and relational models for representing system structures. Thus, they facilitate construction and learning of probabilistic models for large systems. Recently, (Poole, 2003; de Salvo Braz et al., 2005; Milch et al., 2008; Singla & Domingos, 2008) showed that such models enable more efficient inference than possible with propositional graphical models, when inference occurs directly at the relational level.\nPresent exact lifted inference algorithms (Poole, 2003; de Salvo Braz et al., 2006; Milch et al., 2008) and those developed in the efforts above are suitable for discrete domains, thus can in theory be applied to continuous domains through discretization. However, the precision of discretizations deteriorates exponentially in the number of dimensions in the model, and the number of dimensions in relational models is the number of ground random variables. Thus, discretization and usage of discrete lifted inference algorithms is highly imprecise.\nHere, we propose the first exact lifted inference algorithm for Relational Continuous Models (RCMs), a new relational probabilistic language for continuous domains. Our main insight is that, for some classes of potential functions (or potentials), marginalizing out a ground random variable\nin a RCM can yield a RCM representation that does not force other random variables to become propositional (Section 4). Further, relational pairwise models, i.e. products of relational potentials of arity 2, remain relational pairwise models after eliminating out ground random variables in those models. Thus, it leads to the compact representations and the efficient computations. We report Gaussian potentials which satisfy the conditions for relational pairwise models (Section 5). However, we are unsure whether the conditions are only satisfied by Gaussian potentials, yet.\nWe also adapt principles of Inversion Elimination, a method devised by (Poole, 2003), to continuous models. Inversion Elimination\u2019s step essentially takes advantage of an ability to exchange sums and products. The lifted exchange of sums and products translates directly to continuous domains. This is a unique approach to continuous models, even though the insight is brought from discrete models.\nGiven a RCM, our algorithm marginalizes continuous variables by analytically integrating out random variables except query variables. It does so by finding a variable, and eliminating it by Inversion Elimination. If such elimination is not possible, Relational Atom Elimination eliminates each pairwise form in a linear time. If the marginal is not in pairwise form, it converts the marginal into a pairwise form.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the formal definition of RCMs. Section 3 overviews our inference algorithms. Section 4 presents main intuitions and results in a Gaussian potential. Section 5 provides the generalized algorithm for relational pairwise models. Section 6 provides experimental results followed by related works in Section 7. We conclude in Section 8."}, {"heading": "2 Relational Continuous Models", "text": "We present a new relational model for continuous variables, Relational Continuous Models (RCMs). Relations among attributes of objects are represented by Parfactor models. 1 Each parfactor (L,C,AR, \u03c6) is composed of a set of logical variables (L)2, constraints on L (C), a list attributes of objects (AR), and a potential on AR (\u03c6). Here, each attribute is a random variable with a continuous domain.\nWe define a Relational Atom to refer the set of ground attributes compactly. For example, Revenue[B] is a relational atom which refers to revenues of banks (e.g. B = {\u2018Pacific Bank\u2032, \u2018Central Bank\u2032, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 }). To make the parfactor compact, a list of relational atoms is used for\n1Part of its representation and terms are based on the previous works (Poole, 2003; de Salvo Braz et al., 2005; Milch & Russell, 2007). However, our representaion allows continuous random variables.\n2Instead of objects, we use the general term, logical variables.\nAR. To refer to an individual random variable, we use a substitution \u03b8. For example, if a substitution (B = \u2018Pacific Bank\u2032) is applied to a relational atom, then the relational atom Revenue[B] becomes a ground variable Revenue(\u2018Pacific Bank\u2032).3 Formally, applying a substitution \u03b8 to a parfactor g = (L,C,AR, \u03c6) yields a new parfactor g\u03b8 = (L\u2032,C\u03b8,AR\u03b8, \u03c6), where L\u2032 is obtained by renaming the variables in L according to \u03b8. If \u03b8 is a ground substitution, g\u03b8 is a factor. \u0398g is a set of all substitution for a parfactor g. The set of groundings of a parfactor g is represented as gr(g) = {g\u03b8 : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398gr(L:C)}. We use RV(X) to enumerate the random variables in the relational atom X. Formally, RV(\u03b1) = {\u03b1[\u03b8] : \u03b8 \u2208 gr(L)}. LV(g) refers the set of logical variables (L) in g.\nThe joint probability density over random variables is defined by factors in a parfactor. A factor f is composed of Ag and \u03c6. Ag is a list of ground random variables (i.e. (X1(\u03b8), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,XN(\u03b8))). \u03c6 is a potential on Ag: a function from range(Ag) = {range(X1(\u03b8)) \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 range(XN(\u03b8))} to non-negative real numbers. The factor f defines a weighting function on a valuation (v = (v1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vm)): w f (v) = \u03c6(v1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vm)). The weighting function for a parfactor F is the product of weighting function of all factors, wF(v) =\u220f\nf\u2208F w f (v). When G is a set of parfactors, the density is\n3Revenue() refers a random variable. Revenue[] refers a relational atom.\nthe product of all factors in G: wG(v) = \u220f g\u2208G \u220f f\u2208gr(G) w f (v). (1)\nFor example, consider the model in Figure 1. S and B in L are two logical variables which represent markets and banks respectively. For example, S can be substituted by a specific market sector (e.g. S = \u2018stock\u2032). A parfactor f1 = ({Market[S],Gain[S,B]}, \u03c62) is defined over two relational atoms, Market[S] and Gain[S,B]. Market(s) (one variable in Market[S]) represents the quarterly market change (e.g. Market(auto)=\u22123.1%). Gain(s, b) represents the gain of bank b in the market s. Given two values, a potential \u03c61(Market(s),Gain(s, b)) provides a numerical value. Given all valuations of random variables, the product of potentials is the probability density."}, {"heading": "3 Algorithm Overview for RCMs", "text": "RCMs model large real-world systems in a compact way. One inference task with such models is to find the conditional density of query variables given observations of some variables.\nOur inference algorithm, FOVE-Continuous (First-Order Variable Elimination), for RCMs recursively eliminates relational atoms. First, it splits (terminology of (Poole, 2003); shattering in (de Salvo Braz et al., 2005))4 relational\n4Please refer (Poole, 2003; de Salvo Braz et al., 2005) for fur-\natoms. The split operation makes groundings (e.g. RV(X) RV(Y)) of every relational atoms (e.g. X Y) disjoint. It introduces observations as observations of groundings of separate relational variables. For example, observing Market(auto) = 30% creates two separate relational atoms: Market(auto), Market(M)M,auto. The \u2018M , auto\u2019 then appears in parfactors relating to the latter relational atom. After split, FIND-ELIMINABLE finds a relational atom which satisfies conditions for one of the elimination algorithms: Inversion-Elimination (Section 5.2) and Relational-AtomElimination (Section 5.3). The found atom is eliminated by our ELIMINATE-CONTINUOUS algorithm explained in Sections 4 and 5. It iterates the elimination until only query variables are remained.

With a counting formula, (de Salvo Braz et al., 2005; de Salvo Braz et al., 2006) provides a tractable algorithm. (Milch et al., 2008) applies the counting formula to reduce the size of probability density tables. However, these lifted inference algorithms are hard to apply to continuous domains.\n6Observations are required to make the product of RNs a probability density function. Please refer Lemma 1 for details.\nMLNs (Markov Logic Network) (Richardson & Domingos, 2006) use First-order logic sentences to represent relationships over nodes in a graphical model. In this regard, MLNs also represent graphical models at the relational level. (Singla & Domingos, 2008) provides an approximated lifted inference algorithm over discrete domain. (Singla & Domingos, 2007) makes an analysis for infinitely many discrete variables. However, these achievements are not for continuous domains, too. Although there is an inference algorithm for Hybrid MLNs (Wang & Domingos, 2008), it is an approximated algorithm. Thus, most of achievements are comparable to lifted inferences (de Salvo Braz et al., 2005; Milch et al., 2008; Pfeffer et al., 1999) over discrete domain.\nInference with Gaussian distributions is a traditional problem (Roweis & Ghahramani, 1999). In detail, calculating conditional densities of multivariate Gaussians requires matrix inversions (Kotz et al., 2000) which are intractable for high dimensions. (Lerner & Parr, 2001; Shenoy, 2006) builds inference algorithms for hybrid models with Gaussians. (Paskin, 2003) shows that efficient inference is possible for a linear Gaussian when the treewidth of the model is small. For models with large treewidth, however, those inference algorithms over ground models which would be inefficient.\nRecent advances in inference with relational models (Kisynski & Poole, 2009; Mihalkova & Mooney, 2009) show the promise of the approach in discrete models, and underline the promise of our algorithm in continuous models."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion and Future work", "text": "In this paper, we propose a new exact lifted inference algorithm for Relational Continuous Models (RCMs). This algorithm is an advancement of exact inference in RCMs, since all previous works are restricted to discrete domain. Given a query and observations, our algorithm exactly computes the conditional density of the query, when potentials satisfy specified conditions.\nThere are two limitations in our current algorithm. First,\nfound potentials which satisfy the conditions in Section 5 are variants of Gaussian potentials. Thus, finding potentials beyond Gaussian is a goal of our future works. Second, the current algorithm is designed only for continuous variables. Many real-world models require not only continuous variables but also discrete variables. Thus, making an efficient inference algorithm for hybrid relational models would be a promising direction."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We wish to thank Abner Guzman Rivera and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.

The constant becomes the normalizing factor of the probability density function.\nWe prove this by contradiction. Suppose that the product of RNs does not integrate to a constant. That is, it integrates to infinity.\nAccording to Equation 2, the product of RNs maintains the same form after integrating out a random variable x. Thus, only possible case to be infinity is when the marginal (after an integration over x) is a constant function of another random variable y which is not yet integrated.\nWhen x has relations with more than one variable (e.g. y and z), the condition for infinity is not satisfied. The marginal includes a potential \u03c6(y, z). When x has a relation with only y which has relations with other variables beyond x, the condition for infinity is not satisfied. The marginal is not a constant function of y.\nThus, only \u03c6(x, y) satisfies the condtion for infinity. Given the assumption that at least a RN includes a constant, y can not be a variable. Thus, it contradicts the assumption.\nProof of Lemma 6 First, the product of RNMs is analytically integrated by the rule in Equation 3. Thus, the product of RNMs satisfy the Condition (I).\nSecond, the product of RNMs is closed under product operations and marginalizations. It satisfies the Condition (I) because it is an exponential family. That is, the product of two RNMs (\u03c6\u2032RNM(x, y) and \u03c6 \u2032\u2032 RNM(x, y)) is another RNMs (\u03c6\u2032\u2032\u2032RNM(x, y)). Thus, the product of RNMs satisfies the Condition (II).\nThird, it is also closed under marginalizations. When y j in Equation 4 is substituted with y j\u2212d, the following equation is derived.\u222b\nxi \u220f y\u2208Y exp ( \u2212 (xi \u2212 y \u2212 d) 2 2\u03c32 ) = \u220f yi ,yj\u2208Y exp ( \u2212 (yi \u2212 y j \u2212 0))2 2\u03c32 \u00b7 |Y| )\nThus, the result is the product of RNMs.\nAs explained in the proof of Theorem 5, the the product of RNMs can be represented as the following form \u03c6RNM(X, x\u2032) \u00b7 \u03c6RNM(Y, x\u2032) when x\u2032 is the variable of integration.\nWhen y j \u2208 Y in Equation 6 is substituted with y j \u2212 d \u2208 Y\u2032, the following equation is derived.\u222b\nx\u2032 \u03c6RNM(X, x\u2032) \u00b7 \u03c6RNM(Y, x\u2032) = c \u00b7 \u222b x\u2032 \u03c6RN(X, x\u2032) \u00b7 \u03c6RN(Y\u2032, x\u2032)\n= c\u2032 \u00b7 \u03c6\u2032RN(X,X) \u00b7 \u03c6\u2032\u2032RN(X,Y\u2032) \u00b7 \u03c6\u2032\u2032\u2032RN(Y\u2032,Y\u2032) = c\u2032\u2032 \u00b7 \u03c6\u2032RNM(X,X) \u00b7 \u03c6\u2032\u2032RNM(X,Y) \u00b7 \u03c6\u2032\u2032\u2032RNM(Y,Y)\nThe result is also the product of RNMs. Thus, it is closed under marginalizations."}], "references": [{"title": "Lifted firstorder probabilistic inference.

With relational representations, they can model joint probability distributions over large numbers of variables compactly in a natural way. This paper presents a new exact lifted inference algorithm for RCMs, thus it scales up to large models of real world applications. The algorithm applies to Relational Pairwise Models which are (relational) products of potentials of arity 2. Our algorithm is unique in two ways. First, it substantially improves the efficiency of lifted inference with variables of continuous domains. When a relational model has Gaussian potentials, it takes only linear-time compared to cubic time of previous methods. Second, it is the first exact inference algorithm which handles RCMs in a lifted way. The algorithm is illustrated over an example from econometrics. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms both a groundlevel inference algorithm and an algorithm built with previously-known lifted methods.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
