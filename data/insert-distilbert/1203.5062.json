Reichenbach details nine tenses (see Table 1). The tenses detailed by Reichenbach are past, present or future, and may take a simple, anterior or posterior form. In English, these apply to single verbs and to verbal groups (e.g. will have run, where the main verb is run).\nTo describe a tense, Reichenbach introduces three abstract time points. Firstly, there is the speech time, S. This represents the point at which the verb is uttered or written. Secondly, event time E is the time that the event introduced by the verb occurs. Thirdly, there is reference time R; this is an abstract point, from which events are viewed. In Example 1, speech time S is when the author created the discourse (or perhaps when the reader interpreted it). Reference time R is then \u2013 an abstract point, before speech time, but after the event time E, which is the leaving of the building. In this sentence, one views events from a point in time later than they occurred.\n(1) By then, she had left the building.\nWhile we have rich annotation languages for time in discourse, such as TimeML1 and TCNL2, none can mark the time points in this model, or the relations between them. Though some may provide a means for identifying speech and event times in specific situations, there is nothing similar for reference times. All three points from Reichenbach\u2019s model are sometimes necessary to calculate the information used in these rich annotation languages; for example, they can help determine the nature of a temporal relation, or a calendrical reference for a time. We will illustrate this with two brief examples.\n(2) By April 26th, it was all over.\nIn Example 2, there is an anaphoric temporal expression describing a date. The expression is ambiguous because we cannot position it absolutely without an agreed calendar and a particular year. This type of temporal expression is interpreted not with respect to speech time, but with respect to reference time (Ahn et al., 2005). Without a time frame for the sentence (presumably provided earlier in the discourse), we cannot determine which year the date is in. If we are able to set bounds for R in this case, the time in Example 2 will be the April 26th adjacent to or contained in R; as the word by is used, we know that the time is the April 26th following R, and can normalise the temporal expression, associating it with a time on an absolute scale.\nTemporal link labelling is the classification of relations between events or times. We might say an event of the airport closed occurred after another event of the aeroplane landed; in this case, we have specified the type of temporal relation between two events. This task is difficult to automate (Verhagen et al., 2010). There are clues in\n1http://www.timeml.org; Boguraev et al. (2005). 2See Han et al. (2006).\ndiscourse that human readers use to temporally relate events or times. One of these clues is tense. For example:\n(3) John told me the news, but I had already sent the letter.\nExample 3 shows a sentence with two verb events \u2013 told and had sent. Using Reichenbach\u2019s model, these share their speech time S (the time of the sentence\u2019s creation) and reference time R, but have different event times. In the first verb, reference and event time have the same position. In the second, viewed from when John told the news, the letter sending had already happened \u2013 that is, event time is before reference time. As reference time R is the same throughout the sentence, we know that the letter was sent before John mentioned the news. Describing S, E and R for verbs in a discourse and linking these points with each other (and with times) is the only way to ensure correct normalisation of all anaphoric and deictic temporal expressions, as well as enabling high-accuracy labelling of some temporal links.\nSome existing temporal expression normalisation systems heuristically approximate reference time. GUTime (Mani and Wilson, 2000) interprets the reference point as \u201cthe time currently being talked about\u201d, defaulting to document creation date. Over 10% of errors in this system were directly attributed to having an incorrect reference time, and correctly tracking reference time is the only way to resolve them. TEA (Han et al., 2006) approximates reference time with the most recent time temporally before the expression being evaluated, excluding noun-modifying temporal expressions; this heuristic yields improved performance in TEA when enabled, showing that modelling reference time helps normalisation. HeidelTime (Stro\u0308tgen and Gertz, 2010) uses a similar approach to TEA but does not exclude nounmodifying expressions.\nThe recently created WikiWars corpus of TIMEX2 annotated text prompted the comment that there is a \u201cneed to develop sophisticated methods for temporal focus tracking if we are to extend current time-stamping technologies\u201d (Mazur and Dale, 2010). Resources that explicitly annotate reference time will be direct contributions to the completion of this task.\nElson and McKeown (2010) describe how to relate events based on a \u201cperspective\u201d which is\ncalculated from the reference and event times of an event pair. They construct a natural language generation system that requires accurate reference times in order to correctly write stories. Portet et al. (2009) also found reference point management critical to medical summary generation.\nThese observations suggest that the ability to automatically determine reference time for verbal expressions is useful for a number of computational language processing tasks. Our work in this area \u2013 in which we propose an annotation scheme including reference time \u2013 is a first step in this direction.\nIn Section 2 we describe some crucial points of Reichenbach\u2019s model and the requirements of an annotation schema for tense in natural language. We also show how to reason about speech, event and reference times. Then, in Section 3, we present an overview of our markup. In Section 4 we give examples of annotated text (fictional prose and newswire text that we already have another temporal annotation for), event ordering and temporal expression normalisation. Finally we conclude in Section 5 and discuss future work."}, {"heading": "2 Exploring Reichenbach\u2019s model", "text": "Each tensed verb can be described with three points; speech time, event time and reference time. We refer to these as S, E and R respectively. Speech time is when the verb is uttered. Event time is when the action described by the verb occurs. Reference time is a viewpoint from where the event is perceived. A summary of the relative positions of these points is given in Table 1.\nWhile each tensed verb involves a speech, event and reference time, multiple verbs may share one or more of these points. For example, all narrative in a news article usually has the same speech time (that of document creation). Further, two events linked by a temporal conjunction (e.g. after) are very likely to share the same reference time.\nFrom Table 1, we can see that conventionally English only distinguishes six tenses. Therefore, some English tenses will suggest more than one arrangement of S, E and R. Reichenbach\u2019s tense names suffer from this ambiguity too, but to a much lesser degree. When following Reichenbach\u2019s tense names, it is the case that for past tenses, R always occurs before S; in the future, R is always after S; and in the present, S and R\nare simultaneous. Further, \u201canterior\u201d suggests E before R, \u201csimple\u201d that R and E are simultaneous, and \u201cposterior\u201d that E is after R. The flexibility of this model permits the full set of available tenses (Song and Cohen, 1988), and this is sufficient to account for the observed tenses in many languages.\nOur goal is to define an annotation that can describe S, E and R (speech, event and reference time) throughout a discourse. The lexical entities that these times are attached to are verbal events and temporal expressions. Therefore, our annotation needs to locate these entities in discourse, and make the associated time points available."}, {"heading": "2.1 Special properties of the reference point", "text": "The reference point R has two special uses. When sentences or clauses are combined, grammatical rules require tenses to be adjusted. These rules operate in such a way that the reference point is the same in all cases in the sequence. Reichenbach names this principle permanence of the reference point.\nSecondly, when temporal expressions (such as a TimeML TIMEX3 of type DATE, but not DURATION) occur in the same clause as a verbal event, the temporal expression does not (as one might expect) specify event time E, but instead is used to position reference time R. This principle is named positional use of the reference point."}, {"heading": "2.2 Context and the time points", "text": "In the linear order that events and times occur in discourse, speech and reference points persist until changed by a new event or time. That is, the\nreference time from one sentence will roll over to the next sentence, until it is repositioned explicitly by a tensed verb or time. To cater for subordinate clauses in cases such as reported speech, we add a caveat \u2013 S and R persist as a discourse is read in textual order, for each context. We can define a context as an environment in which events occur, such as the main body of the document, reported speech, or the conditional world of an if clause (Hornstein, 1990). For example:\n(4) Emmanuel had said \u201cThis will explode!\u201d, but changed his mind.\nHere, said and changed share speech and reference points. Emmanuel\u2019s statement occurs in a separate context, which the opening quote instantiates, ended by the closing quote (unless we continue his reported speech later), and begins with an S that occurs at the same time as said\u2019s E. This persistence must be explicitly stated in RTMML."}, {"heading": "2.3 Capturing the time points with TimeML", "text": "TimeML is a rich, developed standard for temporal annotation. There exist valuable resources annotated with TimeML that have withstood significant scrutiny. However TimeML does not address the issue of annotating Reichenbach\u2019s tense model with the goal of understanding reference time or creating resources that enable detailed examination of the links between verbal events in discourse.\nAlthough TimeML permits the annotation of tense for <EVENT>s, it is not possible to unambiguously map its tenses to Reichenbach\u2019s model.\nThis restricts how well we can reason about verbal events using TimeML-annotated documents. Of the usable information for mapping TimeML annotations to Reichenbach\u2019s time points, TimeML\u2019s tense attribute describes the relation between S and E, and its aspect attribute can distinguish between PERFECTIVE and NONE \u2013 that is, between E < R and a conflated class of (E = R)\u2228(R < E). Cases where R < E are often awkward in English (as in Table 1), and may even lack a distinct syntax; the French Je vais dormir and Je dormirai both have the same TimeML representation and both translate to I will sleep in English, despite having different time point arrangements.\nIt is not possible to describe or build relations to reference points at all in TimeML. It may be possible to derive the information about S, E and R directly represented in our scheme from a TimeML annotation, though there are cases \u2013 especially outside of English \u2013 where it is not possible to capture the full nuance of Reichenbach\u2019s model using TimeML. An RTMML annotation permits simple reasoning about reference time, and assist the labelling of temporal links between verb events in cases where TimeML\u2019s tense and aspect annotation is insufficient. This is why we propose an annotation, and not a technique for deriving S, E, and R from TimeML."}, {"heading": "3 Overview of RTMML", "text": "The annotation schema RTMML is intended to describe the verbal event structure detailed in Reichenbach (1947), in order to permit the relative temporal positioning of reference, event, and speech times. A simple approach is to define a markup that only describes the information that we are interested in, and can be integrated with TimeML. For expositional clarity we use our own tags but it is possible (with minor modifications) to integrate them with TimeML as an extension to the standard.\nOur procedure is as follows. Mark all times and verbal events (e.g. TimeML TIMEX3s and those EVENTs whose lexical realisation is a verb) in a discourse, as T1..Tn and V1..Vn respectively. We mark times in order to resolve positional uses of the reference point. For each verbal event Vi, we may describe or assign three time points Si, Ei, and Ri. Further, we will relate T , S, E and R points using disjunctions of the operators <, = and >. It is not necessary to define a unique set of\nthese points for each verb \u2013 in fact, linking them across a discourse helps us temporally order events and track reference time. We can also define a \u201cdiscourse creation time,\u201d and call this SD.\n(5) John said, \u201cYes, we have left\u201d.\nIf we let said be V1 and left be V2:\n\u2022 S1 = SD\nFrom the tense of V1 (simple past), we can say:\n\u2022 R1 = S1 \u2022 E1 < R1\nAs V2 is reported speech, it is true that:\n\u2022 S2 = E1\nFurther, as V2 is anterior present:\n\u2022 R2 = S2 \u2022 E2 < R2\nAs the = and < relations are transitive, we can deduce an event ordering E2 < E1."}, {"heading": "3.1 Annotation schema", "text": "The annotation language we propose is called RTMML, for Reichenbach Tense Model Markup Language. We use standoff annotation. This keeps the text uncluttered, in the spirit of ISO LAF and ISO SemAF-Time. Annotations reference tokens by index in the text, as can be seen in the examples below. Token indices begin from zero. We explicitly state the segmentation plan with the <seg> element, as described in Lee and Romary (2010) and ISO DIS 24614-1 WordSeg-1.\nThe general speech time of a document is defined with the <doc> element, which has one or two attributes: an ID, and (optionally) @time. The latter may have a normalised value, formatted according to TIMEX3 (Boguraev et al., 2005) or TIDES (Ferro et al., 2005), or simply be the string now.\nEach <verb> element describes a tensed verbal group in a discourse. The @target attribute references token offsets; it has the form target=\"#token0\" or target=\"#range(#token7,#token10)\" for a 4-token sequence. Comma-separated lists of offsets are valid, for situations where verb groups are non-contiguous. Every verb has a unique value in its @id attribute. The tense of a verb\ngroup is described using the attributes @view (with values simple, anterior or posterior) and @tense (past, present or future).\nThe <verb> element has optional @s, @e and @r attributes; these are used for directly linking a verb\u2019s speech, event or reference time to a time point specified elsewhere in the annotation. One can reference document creation time with a value of doc or a temporal expression with its id (for example, t1). To reference the speech, event or reference time of other verbs, we use hash references to the event followed by a dot and then the character s, e or r; e.g., v1\u2019s reference time is referred to as #v1.r.\nAs every tensed verb always has exactly one S, E and R, and these points do not hold specific values or have a position on an absolute scale, we do not attempt to directly annotate them or place them on an absolute scale. One might think that the relations should be expressed in XML links; however this requires reifying time points when the information is stored in the relations between time points, so we focus on the relations between these points for each <verb>. To capture these internal relations (as opposed to relations between the S, E and R of different verbs), we use the attributes se, er and sr. These attributes take a value that is a disjunction of <, = and >.\nTime-referring expressions are annotated using the <timerefx> element. This has an @id attribute with a unique value, and a @target, as well as an optional @value which works in the same was as the <doc> element\u2019s @time attribute. <rtmml> Yesterday, John ate well. <seg type=\"token\" /> <doc time=\"now\" /> <timerefx xml:id=\"t1\" target=\"\n#token0\" /> <verb xml:id=\"v1\" target=\"#token3\"\nview=\"simple\" tense=\"past\" sr=\">\" er=\"=\" se=\">\" r=\"t1\" s=\"doc\" />\n</rtmml>\nIn this example, we have defined a time Yesterday as t1 and a verbal event ate as v1. We have categorised the tense of v1 within Reichenbach\u2019s nomenclature, using the verb element\u2019s @view and @tense attributes.\nNext, we directly describe the reference point of v1, as being the same as the time t1. Finally, we say that this verb is uttered at the same time as the whole discourse \u2013 that is, Sv1 = SD. In RTMML, if the speech time of a verb is not otherwise defined (directly or indirectly) then it is SD. In cases of multiple voices with distinct speech times, if a speech time is not defined elsewhere, a new one may be instantiated with a string label; we recommend the formatting s, e or r followed by the verb\u2019s ID.\nThis sentence includes a positional use of the reference point, annotated in v1 when we say r=\"t1\". To simplify the annotation task, and to verbosely capture a use of the reference point, RTMML permits an alternative annotation with the <rtmlink> element. This element takes as arguments a relation and a set of times and/or verbs. Possible relation types are POSITIONS, SAME TIMEFRAME (annotating permanence of the reference point) and REPORTS for reported speech; the meanings of these are given in Table 2. In the above markup, we could replace the <verb> element with the following: <verb xml:id=\"v1\" target=\"#token3\"\nview=\"simple\" tense=\"past\" sr=\">\" er=\"=\" se=\">\" s=\"doc\" />\n<rtmlink xml:id=\"l1\" type=\"POSITIONS\"> <link source=\"#t1\" /> <link target=\"#v1\" /> </rtmlink>\nWhen more than two entities are listed as targets, the relation is taken as being between an optional source entity and each of the target entities. Moving inter-verbal links to the <rtmlink> element helps fulfil TEI p5 and the LAF requirements that referencing and content structures are separated. Use of the <rtmlink> element is not compulsory, as not all instances of positional use or permanence of the reference point can be annotated using it; Reichenbach\u2019s original account gives an example in German."}, {"heading": "3.2 Reasoning and inference rules", "text": "Our three relations <, = and > are all transitive. A minimal annotation is acceptable. The S, E and\nR points of all verbs, SD and all T s can represent nodes on a graph, connected by edges labelled with the relation between nodes.\nTo position all times in a document with maximal accuracy, that is, to label as many edges in such a graph as possible, one can generate a closure by means of deducing relations. An agendabased algorithm is suitable for this, such as the one given in Setzer et al. (2005)."}, {"heading": "3.3 Integration with TimeML", "text": "To use RTMML as an ISO-TimeML extension, we recommend that instead of annotating and referring to <timerefx>s, one refers to <TIMEX3> elements using their tid attribute; references to <doc> will instead refer to a <TIMEX3> that describes document creation time. The attributes of <verb> elements (except xml:id and target) may be be added to <MAKEINSTANCE> or <EVENT> elements, and <rtmlink>s will refer to event or event instance IDs."}, {"heading": "4 Examples", "text": "In this section we will give developed examples of the RTMML notation, and show how it can be used to order events and position events on an external temporal scale."}, {"heading": "4.1 Annotation example", "text": "Here we demonstrate RTMML annotation of two short pieces of text."}, {"heading": "4.1.1 Fiction", "text": "From David Copperfield by Charles Dickens:\n(6) When he had put up his things for the night he took out his flute, and blew at it, until I almost thought he would gradually blow his whole being into the large hole at the top, and ooze away at the keys.\nWe give RTMML for the first five verbal events from Example 6 RTMML in Figure 1. The fifth, v5, exists in a context that is instantiated by v4; its reference time is defined as such. We can use one link element to show that v2, v3 and v4 all use the same reference time as v1. The temporal relation between event times of v1 and v2 can be inferred from their shared reference time and their tenses; that is, given that v1 is anterior past and v2 simple past, we know Ev1 < Rv1\nand Ev2 = Rv2. As our <rtmlink> states Rv1 = Rv2, then Ev1 < Ev2. Finally, v5 and v6 happen in the same context, described with a second SAME TIMEFRAME link."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 Editorial news", "text": "From an editorial piece in TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) (AP9008150044.tml):\n(7) Saddam appeared to accept a border demarcation treaty he had rejected in peace talks following the August 1988 cease-fire of the eight-year war with Iran.\n<doc time=\"1990-08-15T00:44\" /> <!-- appeared --> <verb xml:id=\"v1\" target=\"#token1\"\nview=\"simple\" tense=\"past\" /> <!-- had rejected --> <verb xml:id=\"v2\"\ntarget=\"#range(#token9,#token10)\" view=\"anterior\" tense=\"past\" />\n<rtmlink xml:id=\"l1\" type=\"SAME_TIMEFRAME\"> <link target=\"#v1\" /> <link target=\"#v2\" /> </rtmlink>\nHere, we relate the simple past verb appeared with the anterior past (past perfect) verb had rejected, permitting the inference that the first verb occurs temporally after the second.

A first step in creating computational tools to do this is to develop an annotation schema for recording the relevant temporal information in discourse. To this end we have presented RTMML, our annotation for Reichenbach\u2019s model of tense in natural language.\nWe do not intend to compete with existing languages that are well-equipped to annotate temporal information in documents; RTMML may be integrated with TimeML. What is novel in RTMML is the ability to capture the abstract parts of tense in language. We can now annotate Reichenbach\u2019s time points in a document and then process them, for example, to observe interactions between temporal expressions and events, or to track reference time through discourse. This is not directly possible with existing annotation languages.\nThere are some extensions to Reichenbach\u2019s model of the tenses of verbs, which RTMML does not yet cater for. These include the introduction\nof a reference interval, as opposed to a reference point, from Dowty (1979), and Comrie\u2019s suggestion of a second reference point in some circumstances (Comrie, 1985). RTMML should cater for these extensions.\nFurther, we have preliminary annotation tools and have begun to create a corpus of annotated texts that are also in TimeML corpora. This will allow a direct evaluation of how well TimeML can represent Reichenbach\u2019s time points and their relations. To make use of Reichenbach\u2019s model in automatic annotation, given a corpus, we would like to apply machine learning techniques to the RTMML annotation task. Work in this direction should enable us to label temporal links and to anchor time expressions with complete accuracy where other systems have not succeeded."}, {"heading": "6 Acknowledgements", "text": "The authors would like to thank David Elson for his valuable comments.

This allows for precise reasoning about tense in documents, and the deduction of temporal relations between the times and verbal events in a discourse. We define the syntax of RTMML, and demonstrate the markup in a range of situations.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
