(Reprint, Translation from French), New Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass. ISBN: 978-8120823228) has to be expanded further to provide for a study of evolution and formation of Indian languages in the Indian language union (sprachbund). The paper analyses the stages in the evolution of early writing systems which began with the evolution of counting in the ancient Near East. Providing an example from the Indian Hieroglyphs used in Indus Script as a writing system, a stage anterior to the stage of syllabic representation of sounds of a language, is identified. Unique geometric shapes required for tokens to categorize objects became too large to handle to abstract hundreds of categories of goods and metallurgical processes during the production of bronze-age goods. In such a situation, it became necessary to use glyphs which could distinctly identify, orthographically, specific descriptions of or cataloging of ores, alloys, and metallurgical processes. About 3500 BCE, Indus script as a writing system was developed to use hieroglyphs to represent the \u2018spoken words\u2019 identifying each of the goods and processes. A rebus method of representing similar sounding words of the lingua franca of the artisans was used in Indus script. This method is recognized and consistently applied for the lingua franca of the Indian sprachbund. That the ancient languages of India, constituted a sprachbund (or language union) is now recognized by many linguists. The sprachbund area is proximate to the area where most of the Indus script inscriptions were discovered, as documented in the corpora. That hundreds of Indian hieroglyphs continued to be used in metallurgy is evidenced by their use on early punch-marked coins. This explains the combined use of syllabic scripts such as Brahmi and Kharoshti together with the hieroglyphs on Rampurva copper bolt, and Sohgaura copper plate from about 6 th century BCE.Indian hieroglyphs constitute a writing system for meluhha language and are rebus representations of archaeo-metallurgy lexemes. The rebus principle was employed by the early scripts and can legitimately be used to decipher the Indus script, after secure pictorial identification.\nInvention of bronze-age technologies necessitated the invention and development of a writing system called Indus Script which is evidenced in corpora of about 6000 inscriptions. [1] Around 7500 BCE [2] , tokens appeared and represented perhaps the early deployment of a writing system to count objects. Many geometric shapes were used for the tokens. [3] Tracing the evolution of a writing system [4] , Schmandt-Besserat evalutes the next stage of keeping tokens in envelopes with markings abstracting the tokens inside and calls these abstract numbers are \u2018the culmination of the process\u2026\u2019 [5] This evaluation is the starting point for identifying another stage before \u2018the culmination\u2019 represented by the use of syllabic representation in glyphs of sounds of a language.\nThat penultimate stage, before syllabic writing evolved, was the use of hieroglyphs represented on hundreds of Indian hieroglyphs. [6]\nThe arrival of the bronze age was maked by the invention of alloying copper with arsenic, zinc or tin to produce arsenic-alloys, and other alloys such as brass, bronze, pewter. These archaeo-metallurgial inventions enabled the production of goods surplus to the requirements of the artisan guilds. These\ninventions also created the imperative of and necessity for a writing system which could represent about over 500 specific categories of activities related to the artisanal repertoire of a smith. Such a large number of categories could not be handled by the limited number of geometric shapes used in the token system of accounting and documenting \u2013 goods, standard measures of grains, liquids and surface areas.[7]\nThe existence of Indian sprachbund is evidenced by the concordant lexemes used for bronze-age repertoire of bronze-age artisans. These lexemes are compiled in an Indian Lexicon. [8] This is a resource base for further studies in the formation and evolution of most of the Indian languages. Identifiable substrata glosses include over 4000 etyma of Dravidian Etymological Dictionary and over 1000 words of Munda with concordant semantic clusters of Indo-Aryan. That the substrata glosses cover three major language families \u2013Dravidian, Munda and Indo-Aryan -- is a surprising discovery. There are over 1240 semantic clusters included in the Indian Lexicon from over 25 languages which makes the work very large, including cognate entries of CDIAL (Indo-Aryan etyma), together with thousands of lexemes of Santali, Mundarica and\nother languages of the Austro-Asiatic linguistic group, and, maybe, Language X. . Most of the lexical archive relate to the bronze-age cultural context and possible entries are relatable rebus to Indian hieroglyphs. Many are found to be attested as substratum lexemes only in a few languages such as Nahali, Kashmiri, Kannada or Telugu or lexical entries of Hemacandra\u2019s de\u015b\u012b n\u0101mam\u0101l\u0101 (Pr\u0101k\u1e5bt); thus, many present-day Indian languages are rendered as dialects of an Indus language or proto-Indic lingua franca or gloss. The identification of a particular Indian language as the Indus language has presented some problems because of the received wisdom about grouping of language families in Indo-European linguistic analyses. Some claims of decipherment have assumed the language to be Tamil, of Dravidian language family; some have assumed the language to be Sanskrit, of Indo-Aryan language family. A resolution to these problems comes from a surprising source: Manu.\nMleccha, Indus language of Indian linguistic area (sprachbund). Indian linguistic area map, including mleccha and vedic (After F. Southworth, 2005; VEDIC AND MLECCHA added.) A language family, mleccha (?language X), is attested in the ancient literature of India. This is the lingua franca, the spoken version of the language of the civilization of about 5000 years ago, distinct from the grammatically correct version called Sanskrit represented in the vedic texts and other ancient literature. Ancient texts of India are replete with insights into formation and evolution of languages. Some examples are: Bharata\u2019s Natya Shastra, Patanjali\u2019s Mahabhashya, Hemacandra\u2019s De\u015b\u012bn\u0101mam\u0101l\u0101, Nighan\u1e6dus, Panini\u2019s A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhyayi, Tolkappiyam\u2013Tamil grammar. The evidence which comes from Manu, dated to ca. 500 BCE. Manu (10.45) underscores the linguistic area: \u0101rya v\u0101cas mleccha v\u0101cas te sarve dasyuvah sm\u1e5bt\u0101h [trans. \u201cboth \u0101rya speakers and mleccha speakers (that is, both speakers of literary dialect and colloquial or vernacular dialect) are all remembered as dasyu\u201d]. Dasyu is a general reference to people. Dasyu is cognate with dasa, which in Khotanese language means \u2018man\u2019. It is also cognate with daha, a word which occurs in Persepolis inscription of Xerxes, a possible reference to people of Dahistan, a\nregion east of Caspian sea. Strabo wrote :\"Most of the scythians, beginning from the Caspian sea, are called Dahae Scythae, and those situated more towards the east Massagetae and Sacae.\" (Strabo, 11.8.1). Close to Caspian Sea is the site of Altyn-tepe which was an interaction area with Meluhha and where three Indus seals with inscriptions were found, including a silver seal showing a composite animal which can be called a signature glyph of Indus writing..\nThe identification of mleccha as the language of the Indus script writing system is consistent with the following theses which postulate an Indian linguistic area, that is an area of ancient times when various language-speakers interacted and absorbed language features from one another and made them their own: Emeneau, 1956; Kuiper, 1948; Masica, 1971; Przyludski, 1929; Southworth, 2005.\nSemantic clusters in Indian Lexicon (1242 English words and Botanical species Latin)"}, {"heading": "Economic Court: Flora and Products from Flora",

The bronze age sites extend from Mehrgarh-Harappa (Meluhha) on the west to Kayatha-Navdatoli (Nahali) close to River Narmada to Koldihwa- Khairdih-Chirand on Ganga river basin to Mahisadal \u2013 Pandu Rajar Dhibi in Jharia mines close to Mundari area and into the east extending into Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Nicobar islands. A settlement of Inamgaon is shown on the banks of River Godavari.\nBronze Age sites of eastern India and neighbouring areas: 1. Koldihwa; 2.Khairdih; 3. Chirand; 4. Mahisadal; 5.

Ban Don Ta Phet [After Fig. 8.1 in: Charles Higham, 1996, The Bronze Age of Southeast Asia, Cambridge University Press].\nEvidence related to proto-Indian or proto-Indic or Indus language\nA proto-Indic language is attested in ancient Indian texts. For example, Manusm\u1e5bti refers to two languages, both of dasyu (daha): \u0101rya v\u0101cas, mleccha v\u0101cas. mukhab\u0101h\u016b rupajj\u0101n\u0101m y\u0101 loke j\u0101tayo bahih mlecchav\u0101cas\u2019c\u0101ryav \u0101cas te sarve dasyuvah sm\u1e5bt\u0101h Trans. \u2018All those people in this world who are excluded from those born from the mouth, the arms, the thighs and the feet (of Brahma) are called Dasyus, whether they speak the language of the mleccha-s or that of the \u0101rya-s.\u2019 (Manu 10.45)] This distinction between lingua franca and literary version of the language, is elaborated by Pata\u00f1jali as a reference to 1) grammatically correct literary language and 2) ungrammatical, colloquial speech (de\u015b\u012b).\nAncient text of Panini also refers to two languages in \u015bik\u1e63\u0101: Sanskrit and Pr\u0101k\u1e5bt. Prof Avinash Sathaye provides a textual reference on the earliest occurrence of the word, \u2018Sanskrit\u2019 :\ntri\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6di\u015bcatuh \u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dirv\u0101 var\u1e47\u0101h \u1e63ambhumate mat\u0101h |\npr\u0101k\u1e5bite samsk\u1e5bte c\u0101pi svayam prokt\u0101 svayambhuv\u0101 || (p\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s \u015bik\u1e63\u0101)\nTrans. There are considered to be 63 or 64 var\u1e47\u0101-s in the school (mata) of shambhu. In Prakrit and Sanskrit by swayambhu (manu, Brahma), himself, these var\u1e47\u0101-s were stated.\nThis demonstrates that p\u0101\u1e47ini knew both samsk\u1e5bta and pr\u0101k\u1e5bita as established languages. (Personal communication, 27 June 2010 with Prof. Shrinivas Tilak.)\nChapter 17 of Bharatamuni\u2019s N\u0101\u1e6dya\u015b\u0101stra is a beautiful discourse about Sanskrit and Prakrit and the usage of lingua franca by actors/narrators in dramatic performances. Besides, Raja Shekhara, Kalidasa, Shudraka have also used the word Sanskrit for the literary language. (Personal communication from Prof. TP Verma, 7 May 2010). N\u0101\u1e6dya\u015b\u0101stra XVII.29-30: dvividh\u0101 j\u0101tibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101ca prayoge samud\u0101h\u1e5bt\u0101 mleccha\u015babdopac\u0101r\u0101 ca bh\u0101ratam var\u1e63am a\u015brit\u0101 \u2018The j\u0101tibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 (common language), prescribed for use (on the stage) has various forms.

I suggest that this is a reference to Indian hieroglyphs.\nIt is not a mere coincidence that early writing attested during historical periods was on metal punchmarked coins, copper plates, two-feet long copper bolt used on an A\u015bokan pillar at Rampurva, Sohoura copper plate, two pure tin-ingots found in a shipwreck in Haifa, and even on the Delhi iron pillar clearly pointing to the smiths as those artisans who had the competence to use a writing system. In reference to Rampurva copper-bolt: \u201cHere then these signs occur upon an object which must have been made by craftsmen working for Asoka or one of his predessors.\u201d (F.R. Allchin, 1959, Upon the contextual significance of certain groups of ancient signs, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, London.). The Indus script inscriptions using hieroglyphs on two pure tin-ingots found in Haifa were reviewed (Kalyanaraman, S., 2010, The Bronze Age Writing System of Sarasvati Hieroglyphics as Evidenced by Two \u201cRosetta Stones\u201d - Decoding Indus script as repertoire of the mints/smithy/mineworkers of Meluhha. Journal of Indo-Judaic Studies. Number 11. pp. 47\u201374).\nMah\u0101bh\u0101rata also attests to mleccha used in a conversation with Vidura. \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a refers to mleccha as language (with pronunciation variants) and also provides an example of such mleccha pronunciation by asuras.

Both \u0101rya v\u0101cas and mleccha v\u0101cas are dasyu\n[cognate dahyu, da ha, daha (Khotanese)], people, in general. 1 A fisherman; \u091a \u091a - $ R\u0101m.7.46.32; Ms.8.48,49;1.34. \u2018a fisherman\u2019 (Apte.

The term is likely to be connected with Old Indian d\u00e1syu \u201cenemy\u201d (of the Aryans), which acquired the meaning of \u201cdemon, enemy of the gods\u201d (Mayrhofer, Dictionary II, pp. 28-29). Because of the Indo-Iranian parallel, the word may be traced back to the root das-, from which a term denoting a large collectivity of men and women could have been derived. Such traces can be found in Iranian languages: for instance, in the ethnonym Dahae (q.v., i) \u201cmen\u201d (cf. Av. ethnic name [fem. adj.] d\u0101h\u012b, from d ha-; AirWb., col. 744; Gk. D\u00e1ai, etc.), in Old Persian dah\u0101 \u201cthe Daha people\u201d (Brandenstein and Mayrhofer, pp. 113-14), and in Khotanese daha \u201cman, male\u201d (Bailey, Dictionary, p. 155).\nIn Avestan the term did not have the same technical meaning as in Old Persian. Avestan da iiu-, da\u0144hu-\nrefers to the largest unit in the vertical social organization. See, for example, Avestan x\u1d5ba\u0113tu- (in the\nGathas) \u201cnext of kin group\u201d and nm\u0101na-\u201chouse,\u201d corresponding to Old Persian taum\u0101- \u201cfamily\u201d; Avestan v\u012bs- \u201cvillage,\u201d corresponding to Avestan v\u0259r\u0259z\u0259 na- \u201cclan\u201d; Avestan zantu- \u201cdistrict\u201d; and Avestanda iiu-, da\u0144hu- (Benveniste, 1932; idem, 1938, pp. 6, 13; Thieme, pp. 79ff.; Frye, p. 52; Boyce, Zoroastrianism I, p. 13; Schwartz, p. 649; Gnoli, pp. 15ff.). The connection da iiu, da\u0144hu-\nand arya- \u201cAryans\u201d is very common to indicate the Aryan lands and peoples, in some instances in the\nplural: airii da h\u0101uu ,airiian m da iiun m, airii\u0101bii da hubii . In Ya\u0161t 13.125 and 13.127 five countries (da iiu-) are mentioned, though their identification is unknown or uncertain; in the same Ya\u0161t (13.143-44) the countries of other peoples are added to those of the Aryans: t\u016biriia, sairima, s\u0101inu, d\u0101ha.\nIn Achaemenid inscriptions Old Persian dahyu- means \u201csatrapy\u201d (on the problems relative to the different lists of dahy\u0101va [pl.], cf. Leuze; Junge; Walser, pp. 27ff.; Herzfeld, pp. 228-29; Herrenschmidt, pp. 53ff.; Calmeyer, 1982, pp. 105ff.; idem, 1983, pp. 141ff.) and \u201cdistrict\u201d (e.g., Nis\u0101ya in Media; DB 1.58; Kent, Old Persian, p. 118). The technical connotation of Old Persian dahyu is certain and is confirmed\u2014 despite some doubts expressed by George Cameron but refuted by Ilya Gershevitch\u2014by the loanword da-a-yau-i\u0161 in Elamite. On the basis of the hypothetical reconstruction of twelve \u201cdistricts\u201d and twenty-nine \u201csatrapies,\u201d it has been suggested that the formal identification of the Old Persian numeral 41 with the ideogram DH, sometimes used for dahyu (Kent, Old Persian, pp. 18-19), can be explained by the fact that there were exactly forty-one dahy\u0101va when the sign DHwas created (Mancini).\nFrom the meaning of Old Persian dahyu as \u201climited territory\u201d come Middle Persian and Pahlavi deh \u201ccountry, land, village,\u201d written with the ideogram MTA (Frahang \u012b Pahlaw\u012bg 2.3, p. 117; cf.\nSyr. m\u0101t\u0101), and Manichean Middle Persian dyh(MacKenzie, p. 26). At times the Avestan use is reflected in Pahlavi deh, but already in Middle Persian the meaning \u201cvillage\u201d is well documented; it appears again in Persian deh.\nThat Pali uses the term \u2018milakkhu\u2019 is significant (cf. Uttar\u0101dhyayana S\u016btra 10.16) and reinforces the concordance between \u2018mleccha\u2019 and \u2018milakkhu\u2019 (a pronunciation variant) and links the language with \u2018meluhha\u2019 as a reference to a language in Mesopotamian texts and in the cylinder seal of Shu-ilishu. [Possehl, Gregory, 2006, Shu-ilishu\u2019s cylinder seal, Expedition, Vol. 48, No. 1 http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/481/What%20in%20the%20World.pdf] This seal shows a sea-faring Meluhha merchant who needed a translator to translate meluhha speech into Akkadian. The translator\u2019s name was Shu-ilishu as recorded in cuneiform script on the seal. This evidence rules out Akkadian as the Indus or Meluhha language and justifies the search for the proto-Indian speech from the region of the Sarasvati river basin which accounts for 80% (about 2000) archaeological sites of the civilization, including sites which have yielded inscribed objects such as Lothal, Dwaraka, Kanmer, Dholavira, Surkotada, Kalibangan, Farmana, Bhirrana, Kunal, Banawali, Chandigarh, Rupar, Rakhigarhi.

The example of the usage of phrase \u2018he \u2018lavo is explained by Sayana as a pronunciation variant of: \u2018he \u2018rayo. i.e. \u2018ho, the spiteful (enemies)!\u2019 This grammatically correct phrase, the Asuras were unable to pronounce correctly, notes Sayana. The \u015aB text and translation are cited in full because of the early evidence provided of the mleccha speech (exemplifying what is referred to Indian language studies as \u2018ralayo rabhedhah\u2019; the transformed use of \u2018la\u2019 where the syllable \u2018ra\u2019 was intended. This is the clearest evidence of a proto-Indian language which had dialectical variants in the usage by asuras and devas (i.e. those who do not perform yagna and those who perform yagna using vaak, speech.) This is comparable to mleccha v\u0101cas and \u0101rya v\u0101cas differentiation by Manu.

Hence a woman goes to a man who stays in a well-trimmed (house). He reported to them her having come, saying, \u2018She has indeed come.\u2019 23. The gods then cut her off from the Asuras; and having gained possession of her and enveloped her completely in fire, they offered her up as a holocaust, it being an offering of the gods. (78) And in that they offered her with an anushtubh verse, thereby they made her their own; and the Asuras being deprived of speech, were undone, crying, \u2018He \u2018lavah! He \u2018lavah!\u2019 (79) 24. Such was the unintelligible speech which they then uttered, -- and he (who speaks thus) is a Mlekkha (barbarian). Hence let no Brahman speak barbarous language, since such is the speech of the Asuras. Thus alone he deprives his spiteful enemies of speech; and whosoever knows this, his enemies, being deprived of speech, are undone. 25. That Yajna (sacrifice) lusted after Vaak (speech [80]), thinking, \u2018May I pair with her!\u2019 He united with her. 26. Indra then thought within himself, \u2018Surely a great monster will spring from this union of Yagna and Vaak: [I must take care] lest it should get the better of me.\u2019 Indra himself then became an embryo and entered into that union. 27. Now when he was born after a year\u2019s time, he thought within himself, \u2018Verily of great vigour is this womb which has contained me: [I must take care] that no great monster shall be born from it after me, lest it should get the better of me!\u2019 28. Having seized and pressed it tightly, he tore it off and put it on the head of Yagna (sacrifice [81]); for the black (antelope) is the sacrifice: the black deer skin is the same as that sacrifice, and the black deer\u2019s horn is the same as that womb. And because it was by pressing it tightly together that Indra tore out (the womb), therefore it (the horn) is bound tightly (to the end of the garment); and as Indra, having become an embryo, sprang from that union, so is he (the sacrifice), after becoming an embryo, born from that union (of the skin and the horn). (\u015aB 3.2.1.23-25). (fn 78) According to Sayana, \u2018he \u2018lavo\u2019 stands for \u2018he \u2018rayo\u2019 (i.e. ho, the spiteful (enemies)!\u2019 which the Asuras were unable to pronounce correctly.

By Julius Eggeling, 1885, in SBE Part 12; fn 78-81).\nMesopotamian texts refer to a language called meluhha (which required an Akkadian translator); this meluhha is cognate with mleccha. Seafaring meluhhan merchants used the script in trade transactions; artisans created metal artifacts, lapidary artificats of terracotta, ivory for trade. Glosses of the proto-Indic or Indus language are used to read rebus the Indus script inscriptions. The glyphs of the script include both pictorial motifs and signs and both categories of glyphs are read rebus. As a first step in delineating the Indus language, an Indian lexicon provides a resource, compiled semantically cluster over 1240 groups of glosses from ancient Indian languages as a proto-Indic substrate dictionary. See http://www.scribd.com/doc/2232617/lexicon linked at http://sites.google.com/site/kalyan97/induswriting\n\u201cThe word meluh.h.a is of special interest. It occurs as a verb in a different form (mlecha-) in Vedic only in \u015aB 3.2.1, an eastern text of N. Bihar where it indicates \u2018to speak in barbarian fashion\u2019. But it has a form closer to Meluh.h.a in Middle Indian (MIA): Pali, the church language of S. Buddhism which originated as a western N. Indian dialect (roughly, between Mathura, Gujarat and the Vindhya) has milakkha, milakkhu. Other forms, closer to \u015aB mleccha are found in MIA *mliccha > Sindhi milis, Panjabi milech, malech, Kashmiri bri.c.hun \u2018weep, lament\u2019 (< *mrech-, with the common r/l interchange of IA), W. Pahari mel+c.h \u2018dirty\u2019. It seems that, just as in other cases mentioned above, the original local form *m(e)luh. (i.e. m(e)lukh in IA pronunciation, cf. E. Iranian bAxdhI \u2018Bactria\u2019 > AV *bahli-ka, balhi-ka) was preserved only in the South (Gujarat? >Pali), while the North (Panjab, Kashmir, even \u015aB and Bengal) has *mlecch. The sound shift from-h.h.-/-kh- > -cch- is unexplained; it may have been modeled on similar correspondences in MIA (Skt. Ak\u1e63i \u2018eye\u2019 _ MIA akkhi, acchi; ks.Etra \u2018_eld\u2019 _ MIA khetta, chetta, etc.) The meaning of Mleccha must have evolved from \u2018self-designation\u2019 > \u2018name of foreigners\u2019, cf. those of the Franks > Arab farinjI \u2018foreigner.\u2019 Its introduction into Vedic must have begun in Meluh.h.a, in Baluchistan-Sindh, and have been transmitted for a long time in a non-literary level of IA as a nickname, before surfacing in E. North India in Middle/Late Vedic as Mleccha. (Pali mil\u0101ca is influenced by a `tribal\u2019 name, Pi\u015b\u0101 ca, as is Sindhi milindu, milidu by Pulinda; the word has been further `abbreviated\u2019 by avoiding the difficult cluster ml- : Pr\u0101k\u1e5bt mecha, miccha, Kashmiri m \u0129 c(h), Bengali mech (a Tib.-Burm tribe) and perhaps Pashai mece if not < *m\u0113cca `defective\u2019 (Turner, CDIAL 10389. | Parpola 1994: 174 has attempted a Dravidian explanation.

The author later recounts this and posits that Harappan were illiterate and takes the glyphs of the script to be symbols without any basis in any underlying language.[cf.

Shapes of some text glyphs also resemble the shell-cutter\u2019s saw:\nV294 V295 V296V297\nIt is unlikely that Akkadian was a possible underlying language because a cuneiform cylinder seal with an Akkadian inscription, showing a seafaring Meluhhan merchant (carrying an antelope) required an interpreter, Shu-\nilishu, confirming that the Meluhhan\u2019s language was not Akkadian. There is substantial agreement among scholars pointing to the Indian civilization area as a linguistic area.\nI suggest that Meluhha mentioned in Mesopotamian texts of 3 rd -2 nd millennium BCE is a language of this linguistic area. That meluhha and mleccha are cognate and that mleccha is attested as a mleccha v\u0101cas (mleccha speech) distinguished from arya v\u0101cas (arya speech) indicates that the linguistic area had a colloquial, ungrammatical mleccha speech \u2013 lingua franca and a grammatically correct arya speech \u2013 literary language. The substrate glosses of the Indian lexicon are thus reasonably assumed to be the glosses of mleccha v\u0101cas, the speech of the artisans who produced the artifacts and the inscribed objects with the writing system. This assumption is further reinforced by the fact that about 80% of archaeological sites of the civilization are found on the banks of Vedic River Sarasvati leading some scholars to rename the Indus Valley civilization as Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization.\nIn this context, the following monumental work by Sylvan Levi, Jules Bloch and Jean Przyluski published in the 1920\u2019s continues to be relevant, even today, despite some advances in studies related to formation of Indian languages and the archaeological perspectives of and evidences from the civilization.\nPrzyluski notes the principal forms of the words signifying \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018woman\u2019 in the Munda languages:\nMan: hor, h\u014drol, harr, h\u00f5r, ha\u1e5ba, ho\u1e5b, koro\nWoman: k\u016b\u1e5b\u0129, \u0113r\u0101, ko\u1e5bi, kol\nComparing \u2018son\u2019 and \u2018daughter\u2019 in Santali:\nSon = kora hapan; daughter = kuri hapan\n\u201c\u2026a root kur, kor is differentiated in the Munda languages for signifying: man, woman, girl and boy. That\nin some cases this root has taken a relatively abstract sense is proved by Santali ko\u1e0da, ko\u1e5ba, which signify \u2018one\u2019 as in the expression \u2018ko\u1e0da ke ko\u1e0da\u2019 \u2018each single one\u2019. Thus one can easily understand that the same root has served the purpose of designating the individual not as an indivisible unity but as a numerical whole\u2026Thus we can explain the analogy between the root kur, kor \u2018man\u2019 the number 20 in Munda k\u016b\u1e5b\u012b k\u016b\u1e5b\u0129 , ko\u1e0d\u012b and the number 10 in Austro-Asiatic family ko, se-k\u016br, skall, gal.\u201d (ibid., pp. 28- 30).\nHomonym: [ k\u014dla ] n An income, or goods and chattels, or produce of fields &c. seized and sequestered (in payment of a debt).

S. K. Chatterjee called the Munda family of languages as Kol, as the word, according to him, is (in the Sanskrit-Pr\u0101k\u1e5bt form Kolia) an early Aryan modification of an old Munda word meaning \u2018man\u2019. [Chatterjee, SK, The study of kol, Calcutta Review, 1923, p. 455.] Przyluski accepts this explanation. [Przyluski, Non-aryan loans in Indo-Aryan, in: Bagchi, PC, Pre-aryan and predravidian, pp.28-29 http://www.scribd.com/doc/33670494/prearyanandpredr035083mbp]\nNote: This area can be called speakers of \u2018mleccha, meluhha\u2019 or mleccha v\u0101cas according to Manusm\u1e5bti (lingua franca of the artisans). Manusm\u1e5bti distinguishes two spoken language-groups: mleccha v\u0101cas and arya vaacas (that is, spoken dialect distinguished from grammatically correct glosses).\n\u201cA Sprachbund\u2026in German, plural \u201cSprachb\u00fcnde\u201d IPA, from the German word for \u201clanguage union\u201d, also\nknown as a linguistic area, convergence area, or diffusion area, is a group of languages that have become similar in some way because of geographical proximity and language contact. They may be genetically unrelated, or only distantly related. Where genetic affiliations are unclear, the sprachbund characteristics might give a false appearance of relatedness\u2026In a classic 1956 paper titled \u201cIndia as a Linguistic Area\u201d, Murray Emeneau [Emeneau, Murray. 1956. India as a Lingusitic Area. \"Langauge\" 32: 3- 16. http://en.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enwiki/113093] laid the groundwork for the general acceptance of the concept of a Sprachbund. In the paper, Emeneau observed that the subcontinent\u2019s Dravidian and IndoAryan languages shared a number of features that were not inherited from a common source, but were areal features, the result of diffusion during sustained contact.\u201d Common features of a group of languages in a Sprachbund are called \u2018areal features\u2019. In linguistics, an areal feature is any typological feature shared by languages within the same geographical area. An example refers to retroflex consonants in the Burushaski {Berger, H.

In this context, the work by Sylvan Levi, Jules Bloch and Jean Przyluski published in the 1920\u2019s (cited elsewhere) continues to be relevant, even today, despite some advances in studies related to formation of Indian languages and the archaeological perspectives of and evidences from the civilization.\nSome glyphs of the script are yet to be decoded.

(Kirfel, W. Das Pur\u0101\u1e47a Pa\u00f1calak\u1e63a\u1e47a.1927.Bonn : K. Schroeder.) This can be construed as a reference to a migration of the sons of Pracetas towards the northern direction to become kings of the mleccha states. The son of Yayati\u2019s third son, Druhyu, was Babhru, whose son and grandsons were Setu, Arabdha, Gandhara, Dharma, Dh\u1e5bta, Durmada and Praceta. It is notable that Pracetas is related to Dharma and Dh\u1e5bta, who are the principal characters of the Great Epic, the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. It should be noted that a group of people frequently mentioned in the Great Epic are the mleccha, an apparent designation of a group within the country, with Bh\u0101ratam janam (Bh\u0101rata people). This is substantiated by the fact that Bhagadatta, the king of Pragjyoti\u1e63a is referred to as mleccha and he is also said to have ruled over two yavana kings (2.13)."}, {"heading": "Melakkha, island-dwellers, lapidaries", "text": "According to the great epic, Mlecchas lived on islands: \u201csa sarv\u0101n mleccha n\u1e5bpatin s\u0101gara dv\u012bpa v\u0101sinah, aram \u0101h\u0101ry\u00e0m \u00e0sa ratn\u0101ni vividh\u0101ni ca, andana aguru vastr\u0101\u1e47i ma\u1e47i muktam anuttamam, k\u0101\u00f1canam rajatam vajram vidrumam ca mah\u0101dhanam: (Bhima) arranged for all the mleccha kings, who dwell on the ocean islands, to bring varieties of gems, sandalwood, aloe, garments, and incomparable jewels and pearls, gold, silver, diamonds, and extremely valuable coral\u2026 great wealth.\u201d (MBh. 2.27.25-27). The reference to gems, pearls and corals evokes the semi-precious and precious stones, such as carnelian and agate, of Gujarat traded with Mesopotamian civilization. According to Sumerian records from the Agade Period (Sargon, 2373-2247 BC), Sumerian merchants traded with people from (at least) three named foreign places: Dilmun (now identified as the island of Bahrain in the Persian Gulf); Magan (a port on the coastline between the head of the Persian Gulf and the mouth of the Sindhu river); and Meluhha. Mentions of trade with Meluhha become frequent in Ur III period (2168-2062 BCE) and Larsa dynasty (2062- 1770 BCE). To the end of the Sarasvati Civilization period, the trade declines dramatically attesting to Meluhha being the Sarasvati Civilization. By Ur III Period, Meluhhan workers residing in Sumeria had Sumerian names, leading to a comment: \u2018\u2026three hundred years after the earliest textually documented contact between Meluhha and Mesopotamia, the references to a distinctly foreign commercial people have been replaced by an ethnic component of Ur III society\u2019 This is an economic presence of Meluhhan traders maintaining their own village for a considerable span of time.(Parpola, Simo, Asko Parpola, and Robert H. Brunswig, Jr., 1977, \u201cTheMeluhha Village \u2014 Evidence of Acculturation of Harappan Traders in Late Third Millenium Mesopotamia?\u201d, Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, Volume 20, Part II.)\nThe epic also refers to the p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava Sahadeva\u2019s conquest of several islands in the sea with mleccha inhabitants.\nA reference also to the salty marshes of Rann of Kutch in Gujarat (and also, perhaps, the Makran coast, south of Karachi), may also be surmised, where settlements and fortifications such as Amri Nal, Allahdino, Dholavira (Kotda) Sur-kota-da, and Kanmer have been excavated \u2013 close to the Sarasvati River Basin as the River traversed towards the Arabian ocean. Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara (tr. CH Tawney, 1880, Calcutta; rep. New Delhi, 1991), I, p. 151 associates mleccha with Sind. Mleccha kings paid tributes of sandalwood, aloe, cloth, gems, pearls, blankets, gold, silver and valuable corals.\nNakula conquered western parts of Bh\u0101ratavar\u1e63a teeming with mleccha (MBh.V.49.26: yah prat\u012bc\u012bm di\u015bam cakre va\u015be mlecchaga\u1e47\u0101yut\u0101m sa tatra nakulo yoddh\u0101 citrayodh\u012b vyavasthitah). B\u1e5bhatsamhit\u0101 XIV.21 refers to lawless mleccha who inhabited the west: nirmary\u0101d\u0101 mlecch\u0101 ye pa\u015bcimadiksthit \u0101steca. A Buddhist chronicle, \u0101ryaManju\u015br\u012b M\u016blakalpa [ed. Ganapati \u015a\u0101stri, II, p. 274] associates pratyanta (contiguous)with mlecchade\u015ba in western Bh\u0101ratavar\u1e63a: pa\u015bcim\u0101m di\u015b\u012bm \u0101s\u1e5btya r\u0101j\u0101no mriyate tad\u0101 ye \u2018pi pratyantav\u0101sinyo mlecchataskaraj\u012bvinah. (trans. \u2018Then (under a certain astrological combination) the kings who go to the west die; also inhabitants of pratyanta live like the mlecchas and taskara.\u2019)\nThis metaphor defines the region fit for yajna. This metaphor also explains the movements of mleccha, such as kamboja-yavana, p\u0101rada-pallava along the Indian Ocean Rim as sea-faring merchants from Meluhha. This parallels the hindu-bauddha continuum exemplified by the Mathura lion capital with \u015brivatsa and Angkor Wat (Nagara v\u0101tika) as the largest Vi\u1e63\u1e47u mandiram in the world, together with celebration of Bauddham in many parts of central, eastern and southeastern Asian continent. Mleccha were at no stage described in any text as people belonging to one ethnic, religious or linguistic group. This self-imposed restriction evidenced by all writers of the early Indian cultural tradition \u2013 Veda, Bauddha, Jaina alike \u2013 is of fundamental significance in understanding that mleccha constituted the core of the people on the banks of Rivers Sarasvati and Sindhu and were the principal architects, artisans, workers, and people, in general, of the Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization throughout its stages of evolution through phases in modes of production \u2013 pastoral, agricultural, industrial \u2013 and interactions with neighbors, trading in surplus food products and artefacts generated and sharing cultural attributes/ characteristics.\nVarious terms are used to describe mleccha social groups and communities: pratyantade\u015ba (Artha\u015b\u0101stra VII.10.16), paccantim\u0101 janapada (Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka V.13.12, vol. I, p. 197), a\u1e6davi, a\u1e6davika (DC Sircar, Selected Inscriptions, vol.

Some mleccha lived in border areas and forests, e.g. pratyanta n\u1e5bpatibhir (frontier kings: JF Fleet, CII, vol. II, \u2018Allahabad Posthumous Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta, text line 22, p. 116) cf. Artha\u015b\u0101stra\u2013 a 4 th century BCE text \u2014 I.12.21; VII.14.27; XIV.1.2; mleccha j\u0101ti are: bheda,kir\u0101ta, \u015babara, pulinda: Amarako\u015ba II.10.20, a fifth century CE text).\nIn many Persian inscriptions Yauna, Gandh\u0101ra and Saka occur together. [For e.g., DC Sircar, Selected Inscriptions, no.2 \u2018Persepolis Inscription on D\u0101rayavahu\u1e63 (Darius c. 522-486 BCE),\u2019 lines 12-13, 18, p.7; no. 5, \u2018Perseplis Inscription of Khshay\u0101rsh\u0101 (Xerxes c. 486-465)\u2019, lines 23, 25-6, p. 12].\nThus, yavana may be a reference to people settled in the northwest Bh\u0101ratavar\u1e63a (India).\nThere are references to Mleccha (that is, \u015baka, Yavana, Kamboja, Pahlava) in B\u0101la K\u0101n\u1e0da of the Valmiki R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a (1.54.21-23; 1.55.2-3).

The Paradas were located on river Sailoda in Sinkiang (MBh II.51.12; II.52.13; VI.87.7 etc) and probably as far as upper reaches of river Oxus and Jaxartes (Op cit, p 159-60, Dr M.

The sons were to rule over people such as Yavana, Bhoja and Y\u0101dava (MBh. 1.80.23-4; Matsya Pur\u0101\u1e47a 34.29-30). Yavana, descendants of Turva\u015bu are noted as meat-eaters, sinful and hence, an\u0101rya. [MBh. trans. PC Roy, vol. I, p. 179] These people were brought over the sea safely by Indra (RV 6.20.12). In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, sons of Anu are noted as mleccha. \u1e5bgveda notes that Yadu and Turva\u015ba are d\u0101sa (RV 10.62.10):\nsanema te vas\u0101 navya indra pra p\u016brava stavanta en\u0101 yajnaih\nsapta yat purah \u015barma \u015b\u0101rad\u012br dadrui\u015ba dhan d\u0101s\u012bh purukuts\u0101ya \u015bik\u1e63an\ntvam vrdha indraprvyarja bh\u016br varivasyann u\u015bane k\u0101vy\u0101ya\npar\u0101 navav\u0101stvam anudeyam mahe pitre dad\u0101tha svam nap\u0101tam\ntvam dhunir indra dhunimtr\u1e47or \u0101pah s\u012br\u0101 na sravant\u012bh\npra yat samudram ati \u015b\u016bra par\u015bi p\u0101raya turva\u015bam yadum svasti\nRV 6.020.10 (Favoured) by your proection, Indra, we solicit new (wealth); by this adoration men glorify you at sacrifices, for that you have shattered with your bolt the seven cities of \u015barat, killing the opponents (of sacred rites), killing the opponents (of sacred rites), and giving (their spoils) to Purukutsa.

[samudram atiprapar\u1e63i = samudram atikramya pratir\u1e47o bhavasi = when you are crossed, having traversed the ocean, you have brought across Turva\u015ba and Yadu, both standing on the future shore, samudrap\u0101reti\u1e63\u1e6dhantau ap\u0101rayah].\nNandana, another commentator of M\u0101nava Dharma \u015b\u0101stra. X.45, defines \u0101ryav\u0101c as samsk\u1e5btav\u0101c. Thus, according to Medh\u0101tithi, neither habitation nor mleccha speech is the ground for regarding groups as Dasyus, but it is because of their particular names Barbara etc., that they are so regarded. These people were brought over the sea safely by Indra, as noted by this \u1e5bca. This \u1e5bca also notes that Yadu and Turva\u015ba (are) d\u0101sa; and that Turva\u015bu is a son of Yay\u0101ti. The sons of Yay\u0101ti were to rule over people such as Yavana, Bhoja and Y\u0101dava. Turva\u015bu and Yadu crossed the oceans to come into Bh\u0101ratavar\u1e63a. In this \u1e5bca., \u2018samudra\u2019 can be interpreted only as an ocean. The ocean crossed by Indra, may be not too far from Sindhu. Sindhu is a \u2018natural ocean frontier\u2019 in \u1e5bgveda. Given the activities of the Meluhha along the Makran Coast (300 km. south of Mehergarh, in the neighbourhood of Karachi), Gulf of Kutch and Gulf of Khambat, (evidence?

In places north of Lamgham district, i.e. north bank of river Kabul, near Peshawar were regions known as Mi-li-ku, the frontier of the mleccha lands. [S.

Sagara also absolved them of their duty to offer yajna to agni and to study the Veda. [V\u0101yu Pur\u0101\u1e47a 88.122. 136- 43; Brahm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da Pur\u0101\u1e47a 3.48.43-49; 63.119-34.] This is how these Yavana, P\u0101rada and Pahlava also became mleccha. [Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a 4.3.38- 41.] The implication is that prior to Sagara\u2019s command, these k\u1e63atriya communities did respect Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha as their priest, studied the Veda and performed yajna. [Harivam\u015ba 10.41-45.] \u015aaka who were designated as kings of mleccha j\u0101ti by Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da Utpala (10 th century) in his commentary on B\u1e5bhatsamhit\u0101, were defeated by Candragupta II. That the mleccha were also adored as \u1e5b\u1e63i is clear from the verse of B\u1e5bhatsamhit\u0101 2.15: mlecch\u0101 hi yavan\u0101s te\u1e63u samyak \u015b\u0101stram kadam sthitam \u1e5b\u1e63ivat te \u2018pi p\u016bjyante kim punar daivavid dvij\u0101h (The yavana are mleccha, among them this science is duly established; therefore, even they (although mleccha) are honoured as \u1e5b\u1e63i; how much more (praise is due to an) astrologer who is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019). B\u1e5bhatsamhit\u0101 14.21 confirms that the yavana, \u015baka and pahlava lived on the west. Similarly, Konow notes that Sai-wang (Saka King) mentioned in Chinese accounts should be interpreted as Saka Muru\u1e47\u1e0da and the territory he occupied as K\u0101pi\u015ba.

[EJ Rapson, ed., 1922,Cambridge History of India , vol. I, Ancient India, Cambridge, p. 564.] Another view expressed by Thomas is that the migration was through Sindh and the valley of the Sindhu River. [FW Thomas, 'Sakastana', JRAS, 1906, p. 216.] Kalha\u1e47a notes that Jalauka, a son of A\u015boka took possession of K\u0101\u015bm\u012bra, advanced as far as Kanauj, after crushing a horse of mleccha. [R\u0101jatarangi\u1e47\u012b, 1.107-8.] Greek invasions occurred later, during the reign of Pu\u1e63yamitra \u015bunga (c. 185-150 BCE). The regions inhabited by the \u2018milakkha\u2019 could be the Vindhyan region. The term, \u2018mleccha\u2018 of which \u2018milakkha\u2019 is a variant, could as well have denoted the indigenous people (Nahali?) or of Bh\u0101ratavar\u1e63a who had lived on the Sarasvati River basin and who moved towards other parts of Bh\u0101ratavar\u1e63a after the gradual desiccation of the river, over a millennium, between c. 2500 and 1500 BCE.

Records refer to Meluhhan ships docking at Sumer. There were Meluhhans in various Sumerian cities; there was also a Meluhhan town or district at one city. The Sumerian records indicate a large volume of trade; according to a Sumerian tablet, one shipment from Meluhha contained 5,900 kg of copper (13,000 lbs, or 6 \u00bd tons)! The bulk of this trade was done through Dilmun, not directly with Meluhha. In our view, the formative stages of the Civilization also had their locus in the coastal areas \u2013 in particular, the Gulf of Khambat, Gulf of Kutch and Makran coast, as evidenced by the wide shell-bangle, dated to c. 6500 BCE, made of turbinella pyrum or \u015bankha, found in Mehergarh, 300 miles north of the Makran coast.\nTanana mleccha\nA Jaina text, Avasyaka Churani notes that ivory trade was managed by mleccha, who also traveled from Uttaravaha to Dakshinapatha.[ Jain, 1984, Life in Ancient India as Described in the Jain Canon and Commentaries (6th century BC - 17th century AD, p. 150.] Guttila Jataka (ca.4 th cent.) makes reference to itinerant ivory workers/traders journeying from Varanasi to Ujjain.

He has in this opened up a new line of enquiry. Prof. Jules Bloch in his article on Sanskrit and Dravidian, also translated in this volume, has the position of those who stand exclusively for Dravidian influence and has proved that the question of the Munda substratum in Indo-Aryan cannot be overlooked\u2026In 1923, Prof. Levi, in a fundamental article on Pre-Aryen et Pre-Dravidian dans Vinde tried to show that some geographical names of ancient India like Kosala-Tosala, Anga-Vanga, Kalinga-Trilinga, Utkala-Mekala and Pulinda-Kulinda, ethnic names which go by pairs, can be explained by the morphological system of the Austro-Asiatic languages. Names like Accha-Vaccha, Takkola-Kakkola belong to the same category. He concluded his long study with the following observation, \u201c We must know whether the legends, the religion and the philosophical thought of India do not owe anything to this past. India has been too exclusively examined from the Indo-European standpoint. It ought to be remembered that India is a great maritime country\u2026 the movement which carried the Indian colonization towards the Far East\u2026 was far from inaugurating a new route\u2026Adventurers, traffickers and missionaries profited by the technical progress of navigation and followed under better conditions of comfort and efficiency, the way traced from time immemorial, by the mariners of another race, whom Aryan or Aryanised India despised as savages.\u201d In 1926, Przyluski tried to explain the name of an ancient people of the Punjab, the Udumbara, in a\nsimilar way and affiliate it to the Austro-Asiatic group. (cf. Journal Asiatique, 1926, 1, pp. 1-25, Un ancien peuple du Pendjab \u2014 les Udumbaras: only a portion of this article containing linguistic discussions has been translated in the Appendix of this book.) In another article, the same scholar discussed some names of Indian towns in the geography of Ptolemy and tried to explain them by Austro-Asiatic forms\u2026Dr. J. H. Hutton, in an interesting lecture on the Stone Age Cult of Assam delivered in the Indian Museum at Calcutta in 1928, while dealing with some prehistoric monoliths of Dimapur, near Manipur, says that \u201c the method of erection of these monoliths is very important, as it throws some light on the erection of prehistoric monoliths in other parts of the world. Assam and Madagascar are the only remaining parts of the world where the practice of erecting rough stones still continues\u2026.The origin of this stone cult is uncertain, but it appears that it is to be mainly imputed to the Mon-Khmer intrusion from the east In his opinion the erection of these monoliths takes the form of the lingam and yoni. He thinks that the Tantrik form of worship, so prevalent in Assam, is probably due to \u201c the incorporation into Hinduism of a fertility cult which preceded it as .the religion of the country. The dolmens possibly suggest distribution from South India, but if so, the probable course was across the Bay of Bengal and then back again westward from further Asia. Possibly the origin was from Indonesia whence apparently the use of supari (areca nut) spread to India as well as the Pacific.\u201d (From the Introduction by PC Bagchi and SK Chatterjee, 1 May 1929).\nKuiper notes: \u201c \u2026a very considerable amount (say some 40%) of the New Indo-Aryan vocabulary is borrowed from Munda, either via Sanskrit (and Pr\u0101k\u1e5bt), or via Pr\u0101k\u1e5bt alone, or directly from Munda; widebranched and seemingly native, word-families of South Dravidian are of Proto-Munda origin; in Vedic and later Sanskrit, the words adopted have often been Aryanized, resp. Sanskritized. \u201cIn view of the intensive interrelations between Dravidian, Munda and Aryan dating from pre-Vedic times even individual etymological questions will often have to be approached from a Pan-Indic point of view if their study is to be fruitful. It is hoped that this work may be helpful to arrive at this all-embracing view of the Indian languages, which is the final goal of these studies.\u201d F.B.J. Kuiper, 1948, Proto-Munda Words in Sanskrit, Amsterdam, Verhandeling der Koninklijke Nederlandsche Akademie Van Wetenschappen, Afd.

Professor W. Norman Brown has pointed out (The United States and India and Pakistan, 131-132, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1953) that Northwest India, i.e. the Indus Valley and adjoining parts of India, has during most of its history had Near Eastern elements in its political and cultural make-up at least as prominently as it had true Indian elements of the Gangetic and Southern types. [M.B.Emeneau, India as a Linguistic Area [Lang. 32, 1956, 3-16; LICS, 196, 642-51; repr. In Collected papers: Dravidian Linguistics Ethnology and Folktales, Annamalai Nagar, Annamalai University, 1967, pp. 171-186.] The passage is so important that it is quoted in full: \u2018More ominous yet was another consideration. Partition now would reproduce an ancient, recurring, and sinister incompatibility between Northwest and the rest of the subcontinent, which, but for a few brief periods of uneasy cohabitation, had kept them politically apart or hostile and had rendered the subcontinent defensively weak. When an intrusive people came through the passes and established itself there, it was at first spiritually closer to the relatives it had left behind than to any group already in India. Not until it had been separated from those relatives for a fairly long period and had succeeded in pushing eastward would I loosen the external ties. In period after period this seems to have been true. In the third millennium B.C. the Harappa culture in the Indus Valley was partly similar to contemporary western Asian civilizations and partly to later historic Indian culture of the Ganges Valley. In the latter part of the next millennium the earliest Aryans, living in the Punjab and composing the hymns of the Rig Veda, were apparently more like their linguistic and religious kinsmen, the Iranians, than like their eastern Indian\ncontemporaries. In the middle of the next millennium the Persian Achaemenians for two centuries held the Northwest as satrapies. After Alexander had invaded India (327/6-325 B.C.) and Hellenism had arise, the Northwest too was Hellenized, and once more was partly Indian and partly western. And after Islam entered India, the Northwest again was associated with Persia, Bokhara, Central Asia, rather than with India, and considered itself Islamic first and Indian second. The periods during which the Punjab has been culturally assimilated to the rest of northern India are ew if any at all. Periods of political assimilation are almost as few; perhaps a part of the fourth and third centuries B.C. under the Mauryas; possibly a brief period under the Indo-Greek king menander in the second century B.C.; another brief period under the Muslim kingdom of Delhi in the last quarter of the twelfth century A.D.; a long one under the great Mughals in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries A.D.; a century under the British, 1849-1947.\u2019\n\u201cThough this refers to cultural and political factors, it is a warning that we must not leap to linguistic conclusions hastily. The early, but probably centuries-long condition in which Sanskrit, a close ally of languages of Iran, was restricted to the northwest (though it was not the only language there) and the rest of India was not Sanskritic in speech, may well have been mirrored earlier by a period when some other language invader from the Near East-a relative of Sumerian or of Elamitic or what not-was spoken and written in the Indus Valley-perhaps that of invaders and conquerors-while the indigenous population spoke another language-perhaps one of the Dravidian stock, or perhaps one of the Munda stock, which is now represented only by a handful of languages in the backwoods of Central India.\n\u201cOn leaving this highly speculative question, we can move on to an examination of the Sanskrit records, and we find in them linguistic evidence of contacts between the Sanskrit-speaking invaders and the other linguistic groups within India\u2026the early days of Indo-European scholarship were without benefit of the spectacular archaeological discoveries that were later to be made in the Mediterranean area, Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley\u2026 This assumption (that IE languages were urbanized bearers of a high civilization) led in the long run to another block-the methodological tendency of the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century to attempt to find Indo-European etymologies for the greatest possible portion of the vocabularies of the Indo-European languages, even though the object could only be achieved by flights of phonological and semantic fancy\u2026 very few scholars attempted to identify borrowings from Dravidian into Sanskrit\u2026The Sanskrit etymological dictionary of Uhlenbrck (1898-1899) and the Indo-European etymological dictionary of Walde and Pokorny (1930-1932) completely ignore the work of Gundert (1869), Kittel (1872, 1894), and Caldwell (1856,1875)\u2026 It is clear that not all of Burrow\u2019s suggested borrowings will stand the test even of his own principles\u2026\u2019India\u2019 and \u2018Indian\u2019 will be used in what follows for the subcontinent, ignoring the political division into the Republic of India and Pakistan, and, when necessary, including Ceylong also\u2026 the northern boundary of Dravidian is and has been for a long time retreating south before the expansion of Indo-Aryan\u2026 We know in fact from the study of the non-Indo-European element in the Sanskrit lexicon that at the time of the earliest Sanskrit records, the R.gveda, when Sanskrit speakers were localized no further east than the Panjab, there were already a few Dravidian words current in Sanskrit. This involves a localization of Dravidian speech in this area no lather than three millennia ago. It also of course means much bilingualism and gradual abandonment of Dravidian speech in favor of IndoAryan over a long period and a great area-a process for which we have only the most llsd of evidence in detail. Similar relationships must have existed between Indo-Aryan and Munda and between Dravidian and Munda, but it is still almost impossible to be sure of either of these in detail\u2026 The Dravidian languages all have many Indo-Aryan items, borrowed at all periods from Sanskrit, Middle Indo-Aryan and Modern Indo-Aryan. The Munda languages likewise have much Indo-Aryan material, chiefly, so far as we know now, borrowed rom Modern Indo-Aryan, thogh this of course llsdes items that are Sanskrit in form, since Modern Indo-Aryan borrows from Sanskrit very considerably. That Indo-Aryan has borrowed from Dravidian has also become clear. T. Burrow, The Sanskrit Language, 379-88 (1955), gives a sampling and a statement of the chronology involved. It is\nnoteworthy that this influence was spent by the end of the pre-Christian era, a precious indication for the linguistic history of North India: Dravidian speech must have practically ceased to exist in the Ganges valley by this period\u2026 Most of the languages of India, of no matter which major family, have a set of retroflex, cerebral, or domal consonants in contrast with dentals. The retroflexes include stops and nasal certainly, also in some languages sibilants, lateral, tremulant, and even others. Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Munda and even the far northern Burushaski, form a practically solid bloc characterized by this phonological feature\u2026 Even our earliest Sanskrit records already show phonemes of this class, which are, on the whole, unknown elsewhere in the Indo-European field, and which are certainly not Proto-IndoEuropean. In Sanskrit many of the occurrences of retroflexes are conditioned; others are explained historically as reflexes of certain Indo-European consonants and consonant clusters. But, in fact, in Dravidian it is a matter of the utmost certainty that retroflexes in contrast with dentals are Proto-Dravidian in origin, not the result of conditioning circumstances\u2026 it is clear already that echo-words are a pan-Indic trait and that Indo-Aryan probably received it from non-Indo-Aryan (for it is not Indo-European)\u2026 The use of classifiers can be added to those other linguistic traits previously discussed, which establish India as one linguistic area (\u2018an area which includes languages belonging to more than one family but showing traits in common which are found not to belong to the other members of (at least) one of the families\u2019) for historical study. The evidence is at least as clear-cut as in any part of the world\u2026 Some of the features presented here are, it seems to me, as \u2018profound\u2019 as we could wish to find\u2026 Certainly the end result of the borrowings is that the languages of the two families, Indo-Aryan and Dravidian, seem in many respects more akin to one another than Indo-Aryan does to the other Indo-European languages. (We must not, however, neglect Bloch\u2019s final remark and his reasons therefor: \u2018Ainsi donc, si profondes qu\u2019aient ete les influences locales, lls n\u2019ont pas conduit l\u2019aryen de l;inde\u2026 a se differencier fortement des autres langues indo-europeennes.\u2019)\u201d M.B.Emeneau, Linguistic Prehistory of India PAPS98 (1954). 282- 92; Tamil Culture 5 (1956). 30-55; repr. In Collected papers: Dravidian Linguistics Ethnology and Folktales, Annamalai Nagar, Annamalai University, 1967, pp. 155-171.\nThe profundity of these observations by Emeneau and Bloch will be tested through clusters of lexemes of an Indian Lexicon, which relate to the archaeological finds of the civilization.\nTamil and all other Dravidian languages have been influenced by Sanskrit language and literature. Swaminatha Iyer [Swaminatha Iyer, 1975, Dravidian Theories, Madras, Madras Law Journal Office] posits a genetic relationship between Tamil and Sanskrit. He cites GU Pope to aver that several Indo-European languages are linguistically farther away from Sanskrit than Dravidian. He cites examples of Tamil and Sanskrit forms of some glosses: hair: mayir, s\u2019mas\u2019ru; mouth: v\u0101ya, v\u0101 c; ear: \u015bevi, \u015brava; hear: k\u0113\u1e37 ke\u1e47 (Tulu), kar\u1e47a; walk: \u015bel, car; mother: \u0101yi, y\u0101y (Pai\u015b\u0101ci). Evaluating this work, Edwin Bryant and Laurie Patton note: \u201cIt is still more simple and sound to assume that the words which need a date of contact of the fourth millennium BCE on linguistic grounds as loan words in Dravidian might be words originally inherited in Dravidian from the Proto-speech which was the common ancestor of both Dravidian and IndoAryan\u2026It will be simpler to explain the situation if both Indo-Aryan and Dravidian are traced to a common language family. In vocables they show significant agreement. In phonology and morphology the linguistic structures agree significantly. It requires a thorough comparative study of the two language families to conduct a fuller study. \u201c Bryant, Edwin and Laurie L.

This announcement in Archaeometallurgy may be taken as Kitty Hawk\nflight demo or Jean-Francois Champollion demonstration of Egyptian hieroglyphs. Announcing that Indus\nscript, an unsolved puzzle for over 150 years since the first discovery of a seal by the archaeologist of\nBritish India, Alexander Cunningham, are composed of Indian hieroglyphs, the book is said to detail in\nabout 800 pages what could possibly be the earliest invention of writing.\nHundreds of Indian hieroglyphs have been identified in the context of the bronze age and the rebus\nreadings are comparable to the rebus method employed for Egyptian hieroglyphs. The book has related\nthe invention of writing to the invention of bronze-age technologies of mixing copper with other ores such\nas arsenic, zinc, tin to create alloys like bronze, brass, pewter. The book relates the hieroglyphs to the\nlexemes of Indian sprachbund.\nUse of iron was also attested during the bronze age. [9] A surprising find in matching meluhha lexemes\nwith hieroglyphs is that, as noted by the late Gregory Possehl, an Indus archaeologist, iron was also\nused, though archaeo-metallurgy evidence for iron-smelters have not so far been discovered in th\ncivilization area.\nArchaeo-metallurgy studies of Sarasvati (Indus) Civilization have made some progress [10] . These studies\nhave to be elaborated further to identify the processes of continuity evidenced by the iron smelters\nidentified in the Ganga valley. D.K. Chakraborti and James Muhly argue that metallurgy of tin was well\ndeveloped in Indus (Sarasvati) Civilization. The use of zinc as evidenced by the svastika glyphs is\nsurprising and has to be explained further in archaeo-metallurgy context. One possibility is that zinc-\nbearing ores were used to create bronze alloy ingots and tools/vessels.\nMainstream linguistics has no way to determine\na range of dates for this sprachbund (language\nunion). I submit that the language union relates\nto the bronze age inventions and trade which is\ncomplemented by and necessitated the\ninvention of writing. In my view, the script\nrecords the archaeometallurgy transactions\nusing lexes of Indian sprachbund. The tradition\ncontinues in ancient Indian mints which\nproduced the early punch-marked coins. The tradition is also evidenced on the Rampurva copper bolt\nhieroglyphs, Sohgaura copper plate inscription and Sanchi s'rivatsa hieroglyph.\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/IndusValleySeals.JPG/220px-\nIndusValleySeals.JPG\nIndian hieroglyphs typical of the 3rd millennium BCE: Elephant:ibh rebus:ib 'iron'; ko\u1e0d 'one-horned heifer'\nrebus: ko\u1e0d 'smithy';sathiya 'svastika glyph' rebus: satiya,jasta 'zinc'; adar 'zebu' rebus: aduru 'unsmelted\nmetal or ore'; pattar 'trough' rebus: 'smiths' guild'; ka\u1e47\u1e0d kar\u1e47aka 'rim of jar' rebus: ka\u1e47\u1e0d kar\u1e47aka 'furnace\naccount scribe', ayakara 'fish+crocodile' rebus: 'metal-smith' etc.\nHundreds of such examples are discussed in Indian hieroglyphs [11] demonstrating that Indian hieroglyphs\nconstitute a writing system for meluhha language and are rebus representations of archaeo-metallurgy\nlexemes.\nAfter scholars review this work which covers hieroglyphs used in about 5000 indus script inscriptions of\nthe corpora and validate the rebus readings, a mile-stone would have been recorded in the study of\nancient civilizations. The identification of Indian hieroglyphs may, then, turn out to be as historic as the\ndecoding of Egyptian hieroglyphs by Jean-Francois Champollion and be the foundation for further studies\nin (a) the evolution of languages of the Indian sprachbund (language union) and (b) archaeo-metallurgical\ntraditions.\nIndus script corpora and business transactions of jangad, \u2018entrustment note\u2019 A function is posited for specific seals of Indus script corpora (with young bull + lathe hieroglyphs) that the\nhieroglyphs used on such seals were intended to connote \u2018entrustment notes\u2019 ( j\u0101ng\u0101\u1e0d) for trade transactions from Meluhha and constituted an improvement in documentation and control of guild (corporation) transactions over the earlier system of tokens, tallies and bullae.

This showed the hieroglyphs of \u2018young bull + lathe\u2019, a\nhieroglyphic set which is common in the Indus script corpora of now over 6000 inscriptions. What did these two hieroglyphs mean?

Functions of Indus seals in evolution of writing system. [Evidence of seal impressions of Kanmer which could be strung together the way tokens were strung together, as demonstrated by Denise Schmand-Besserat.] The seals with these hieroglyphs may be jangad 'for approval' process/trade transactions (say, between workers' platforms to warehouse or from warehouse to sales agents).

Fatehchand Hirachand (1929) O.C.J. Suit No. 1117 of 1928. At that time the relative section of the Indian Contract Act did not contain the expression \"mercantile-agent\" but only \"person\". On a consideration of the terms mentioned above the learned Judge came to the conclusion that the possession obtained under a document worded as aforesaid was not juridical possession within the meaning of Section 178 of the Indian Contract Act. As regards the term jangad used in the document the learned Judge observed as follows : \"Assuming that jangad in Gujerati ordinarily means 'approval' there is no reason to assume that the goods entrusted jangad are goods to be sold on approval, rather than goods to be shown for approval...The dictionary meaning of the word \"jangad\" is \"approval\". As stated by Madgavkar J. in the passage quoted above, having regard to the printed terms in this case, there appears no reason to assume that the diamonds were entrusted to defendants Nos. 1 and 2 to be sold on approval and not that they were given to them to be shown for approval. In my opinion taking the document as a whole, it is clear that they were given to defendants Nos, 1 and 2 to be shown for approval only...It is, therefore, clear that by the delivery of 173 diamonds to him, even on jangad terms, no property can pass to him under Section 24 of the Sale of Goods Act.\" [unquote]http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/1749483/ In one transaction involving diamonds, the case states: \"The diamonds were forwarded along with\nwritings titled \"ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ENTRUSTMENT\". In the trade they are known as \"Jangad\" notes. The eight diamonds were forwarded under three identical Jangad notes which also specified the value of the diamonds in Rupees per carat. \" http://indiankanoon.org/doc/910302/ Jangad note is typically used in diamond business transactions. \"...jangad receipts (letters/bills issued by diamond owners to whom the diamonds are given for the purpose of business prior to sale/export etc.\" http://www.sitcinfo.com/content/directTaxes/decisions/viewfile.asp?CFN=32591RC.htm Diamond rough processing: \"Each Unit Head sends goods for laser kerfing or sawing. Records of such goods are maintained in registers. Whenever goods are sent to sub contractors for laser operations. Jangads are prepared. Goods meant for laser kerfing are fixed in cassettes and sent to laser division or sub contractors. Diamonds for sawing are sent loose. All goods are sent with details of cut number, quantity, weight, and any other specific instruction that is required.\"http://www.diamjewels.in/infrastructure.htm Comment: It is clear that jangad note is a documentation of a business transaction for property items. It is remarkable that the trade/pocess transaction tradition is traceable to hieroglyphs of Indus writing. The pronunciation in Gujarati is janga\u1e0d relatable to jang\u0101\u1e0diyo \u2018a military guard who accompanies treasure into the treasury\u2019.(Gujarati lexicon) Thus janga\u1e0d is interpreted as 'acknowledgment of entrustment' [of property item(s), which are listed by other hieroglyphs on a seal or seal impression.] The word 'anga\u1e0dia' comes from janga\u1e0d and means 'trust'.

Lahnda: s\u00e3ga\u1e5bh m. \u02bb line of entrenchments, stone walls for defense \u02bc.(CDIAL 12845) Sangar connotes a stone fortification or breastwork of stone by defending guards of an army. (Pushto) Sankata \u2018obstacle\u2019 is semantically relatable to the sangar \u2018defensive observation post\u2019.\u201cSangars - During the Afghan wars of the 'Great Game' tribesmen would hide in the crevices of the rocky mountainsides to observe and to shoot at the British soldiers. These would shoot back, so the positions would be fortified with slabs of rock, embrasures, roofs, camouflage. The Afghan word for these tiny little forts is Sangar. Things have not changed much, and a Sangar is an Observation-Post (OP) which is protected against incoming ordnance and the weather, and from which weapons as well as binoculars could be used. A Sangar is a fortified OP.\u201d http://www.defence-structures.com/glossary.htm \u201cSangar\u201d referred to a stone breastwork, used by the British army on the northwest frontier of India where it was\ngenerally impossible to dig protective trenches. 3.

Thus, the word sangad may have had two substantive semantics which can be reasonably deduced: 1. Consignment for approval; and 2. Made by turners/engravers/stone (ore) workers' guild, of a fortified (guild) settlement. Further researches are needed on the economic developments in ancient India, following the work, Economic history of ancient India (Santosh Kumar Das, 1944). This work presents an evaluation of ancient texts from which business practices can be gleaned. It is necessary to firmly delineate the chronological evolution of production and trade practices of business in the Indian sprachbund which had evolved since 3500 BCE within a broad framework of\n'trusteeship' evidenced by the practice of 'jangad' or entrustment note, comparable to consignment basis for display of products in a shopfront. Chronology of language evolution in Indian sprachbund A falsifiable hypothesis is postulated that it is possible to identify and provide rebus readings from glosses of present-day languagues and can be used to define the contours of Indian sprachbund formed from ca. 3500 BCE. Marathi as we know today is a lot different, yes, from Meluhha of Indian sprachbund of 3500 BCE. See Jules Bloch 'La formation de la langue marathe' [The Formation of the Marathi Language], thesis, [1914/1920], Prix Volney. It is part of Indian sprachbund. Most languages of India today have existed for millenia. A good account of the ancient history of Marathi vernacular, an apabhra\u1e43\u015ba language of Pr\u0101k\u1e5btam family is at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_language Reconstructing proto-indo-aryan vocabulary will be a good start which will help rebus readings of hieroglyphs on Indus writing. This ain't an article of faith. This can be enlarged as a falsifiable hypothesis. Kuiper's and Colin Masica's work on Munda and Language X are path-breakers. The challenge for linguists and philologists is to reconstruct that ancient form of mleccha vaacas (meluhha speech). This term for an ancient speech is attested in ancient texts. When a greater challenge of reconstructing Proto-IE has been joined with a lot of * words, there is no reason why a billion people now speaking languages of Indian sprachbund cannot join the challenge I have posed. There are substratum words which are being compiled, e.g. SARVA project of Southworth, UPenn. (and, of course, my Indian Lexicon of 25+ ancient languages). The challenge to all scholars, engaged in studies of ancient people, is to reconstruct that old form which I have hypothesised as Meluhha (mleccha). SARVA project and my lexicon are just a beginning. Just as CDIAL of Turner was a beginning to provide Indo-Aryan vocabulary. A lot of work done subsequently led to the now prevalent sprachbund thesis. This has to be carried forward to trace all 'technology' words as technology changes got recorded in harosheth hagoyim, 'smithy of nations'. Many language lexicons with glosses, do retain memories of the past. Some words are not remembered in some dialects, some are in some other dialects, as languages differentiate into dialects and assume the characteristics of a 'language' with unique morphological, phonetic, semantic and grammatical characteristics. This is how many 'substrate' words are identified even in Sumerian for example: words such as sanga 'priest', tibira 'merchant'. The key is to list such substrate words and read them rebus, which is what I have attempted in my Indian Hieroglyphs (2012). This is a work intended to be 'torn apart' -- critically rebutted -- by scholars of various disciplines so that the final hazy picture emerges from the mists of the past. One such attempt is to relate 'trefoil' hieroglyphs of ancient Uruk/Indus and Egypt. When cuneiform had been decoded, there is no reason to be dispirited and gasp about the impossibility of decoding Indus script. It can be and has been decoded in a firm, archaeological context of the bronze age. The recognition of Indian sprachbund itself is a breakthrough, even as it is endorsed by one of the authors who compiled Dravidian Etymological Dictionary. He had to concede that there is a 'Language X'. Now, it has also to be conceded that 'Munda' also existed in 4th millennium 'Iran'. Language X + Munda constitute the crux of the glosses of Meluhha (Mleccha) in so far as they relate to the new inventions of words to define a metallurgical repertoire of the bronze-age. When a steam-engine was invented, words had to be used to denote the locomotive. A combination of words was used to define the technological innovation coming out of James Watt's discovery of the steaming kettle throwing out the lid: steam + engine.\nThe history of Indo-aryan languages has NOT yet been fully told. Now the ruling hypothesis is Indian\nsprachbund. Work is ongoing to spell out the contours of this bund. Until Language X and interactions with Munda for Indo-Aryan substratum words are clearly demarcated, the debate will stay joined.\nIndus writing system in Susa and harosheth hagoyim,\u2018smithy of nations\u2019\nSusa was a settlement which was founded around 4000 BCE and had yielded a number of tablets inscribed in Proto-Elamite writing with apparent cuneiform script. Based on the evidences of cuneiform records of contacts with Meluhha, Magan and Dilmun, and the context of the evolving bronze-age, it is possible to evaluate Indus writing in Susa and provide a framework for deciphering Indus writing using the underlying Meluhha language. Judges 4:16 reads: \"Now Barak chased the chariots and the army all the way to Harosheth Hagoyim. Sisera's whole army died by the edge of the sword; not even one survived!\" The reason for the use of the phrase harosheth hagoyim \u2018smithy of nations\u2019 is possibly, a widespread presence of smithy in many bronze- and iron-age settlements, some of which might have produced metallic war-chariots. Indus writing which starts ca. 3500 BCE was a sequel to the system of using tokens and tallies to record property transactions. There is evidence for the presence of Meluhhan settlements in Susa and neighboring regions. Susa finds of cylinder seals and seal impressions, bas-relief of spinner and a ritual basin with hieroglyphs of Indus writing can be consistently interpreted in the Meluhhan language in the context of the evolving bronze-age trade ransactions.kharo\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b (cognate with harosheth) was a syllabic writing system with intimations of contacts with Aramaic writing system. Though early evidences of kharo\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b documents are dated to ca. early 5 th century BCE, it is likely that some form of contract documentation using a proto-form of kharo\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b was perhaps used by artisans and traders, across a vast interaction area which covered a wide geographic area from Kyrgystan (Tocharian) to Haifa (Israel, Seaport on Mediterranean Ocean) \u2013 across Sarasvati-Sindu river-basins, TigrisEuphrates doab, Caspian Sea, and Mediterranean Ocean \u2013 of three civilizations Indus, Mesopotamia and Egypt. The evidence of about 6000 Indus script inscriptions provides the details of products traded in this harosheth hagoyim, a smithy of nations, indeed.\nThe argument is presented in the following sections:\nHarosheth hagoyim, \u2018smithy of nations\u2019\nEvolving bronze-age and use of tallies, tokens, bullae for archives Use of tallies, tokens, bullae for archives in the Near East\nDecoding of the identical inscription on the three tablets of Kanmer Conjecturing a parallel with Sumer bulla envelope system\nPresence of Meluhhan merchant (Shu-ilishu cylinder seal)\nEvidence for the use of hieroglyphs from Indus writing in Susa\n1.

It appears that the Meluhhans were in contact with many interaction areas, Dilmun and Susa (elam) in particular. There is evidence for Meluhhan settlements outside of Meluhha. It is a reasonable inference that the Meluhhans with bronze-age expertise of creating arsenical and bronze alloys and working with other metals constituted the \u2018smithy of nations\u2019, Harosheth Hagoyim.\nThis hypothesis is confirmed by harosheth, (cognate kharo\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b) tradition. kharo\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b was a syllabic writing system with intimations of contacts with Aramaic writing system. Though early evidences of kharo\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b documents are dated to ca. 3 rd century BCE, it is likely that some form of contract documentation using a proto-form of kharo\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b was perhaps used by artisan and traders, across a vast interaction area which covered a wide geographic area from Kyrgystan (Tocharian) to Haifa (Israel, Seaport on Mediterranean Ocean) \u2013 across Sarasvati-Sindu river-basins, Tigris-Euphrates doab, Caspian Sea, and Mediterranean Ocean \u2013 of three civilizations Indus, Mesopotamia and Egypt. The evidence of about 6000 Indus script inscriptions provides the details of products traded in this harosheth hagoyim, a smithy of nations, indeed. Harosheth is spelt in pronunciation: khar-o'-sheth. Harosheth and cognate kharo\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b may mean \u2018workmanship\u2019 or \u2018art of writing\u2019, apart from connoting specifically blacksmiths\u2019 writing system. Artisans had invented early writing systems necessitated by the economic imperative of bronze-age trade. In this smithy of nations, language was not a barrier. The barrier had been bridged by the invention and use of hieroglyphic and syllabic writing systems to record guild production and sea-faring or land-caravan trade transactions.\nSeal.

This hieroglyph announces the arrival of a new professional, an expert carver who can keep accounts of the industrial goods produced in guild workshops and sorted out or displayed on circular working platforms. This hieroglyph is often the terminal signature tune of many inscriptions conveying the message that goods tallied using tablets have been consolidated together to create seal impressions as bills of lading for multi-commodity trade loads. The invention of writing has created a new professional: (accountant) scribe.\nContacts between users of Aramaic- kharo\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b writing systems may be seen as a continuum of interactions among Mesopotamian settlements and Meluhhan settlements as broadly indicated in the following map:\nAfter Walter Reinhold Warttig Matted y de la Torre, 2005, Sumerian Dilmun http://www.bibleorigins.net/dilmunmapseriduurseashorepersiangulf.html\nEvolving bronze-age and use of tallies, tokens, bullae for archives\nThe lapidary had graduated into a smithy worker in the bronze age and needed Indus script inscriptions to account for processing, collating, and dispatching trade loads to trade contacts in interaction areas. The scribe created a seal to account for contributions by artisans of the guild as a record of product descriptions sorted, grouped and delivered into the treasury.\nUse of tallies, tokens for archives in the Near East\n\u201cFrom the beginnings in about 30,000 BCE, the evolution of information processing in the prehistoric Near East proceeded in three major phases, each dealing with data of increasing specificity. First, during the Middle and late Upper Paleolithic, ca. 30,000 \u2013 12,000 BCE, tallies referred to one unit of an unspecified item. Second, in the early Neolithic, ca. 8000 BCE, the tokens indicated a\nprecise unit of a particular good. With the invention of writing, which took place in the urban period, ca. 3100 BCE, it was possible to record and communicate the name of the sponsor/recipient of the merchandise, formerly indicated by seals\u2026The events that followed the invention of tokens can be reconstructed as follows: ca. 3700-2000 BCE: A second stage was reached when groups of tokens\nrepresenting particular transactions were enclosed in envelopes to be kept in archives. Some envelopes bore on the outside the impression of the tokens held inside. Such markings on envelopes were the turning point between tokens and writing. Ca. 3500-3100 BCE (starting in Uruk VI-V): Tablets displaying impressed markings in the shape of tokens superseded the envelopes. Ca. 3100-3000 BCE (starting in Uruk Iva): Pictographic script traced with a stylus on clay tablets marked the true takeoff of writing. The tokens dwindled\u2026The tokens were mundane counters dealing with food and other basic commodities of life, but they played a major role in the societies that adopted them. They were used to manage goods and they affected the economy; they were an instrument of power and they created new social patterns; they were employed for data manipulation and they changed a mode of thought. Above all, the tokens were a counting and record-keeping device and were the watershed of mathematics and communication.\u201d\n(Denise Schmandt-Besserat, 1996, How writing came about, University of Texas Press, p.99, p. 125).\nTallies and tokens were used to archive records of counted goods which\nwere basic necessities such as: animals (lamb, sheep, ewe, cow, dog); foods (bread, oil, food, sweet (honey?), beer, sheep\u2019s milk); textiles (textile, wool, type of garment or cloth, fleece, rope, type of mat or rug); commodities (perfume, metal, bracelet, ring, bed); service (make, build).\nDecoding of the identical inscription on the three tablets of Kanmer\nTokens strung together with a bulla to constitute an archive. (After Denise Schmandt-Besserat, 1996, How writing came about, University of Texas Press).\nDuplicate seal impressions are one type of tablets. An evidence for the use\nof such tablets as category tallies of lapidary workshops is provided by the finds at Kanmer. (Source: http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/agrawal323/Antiquity, D.P. Agrawal et al, Redefining the Harappan hinterland, Anquity, Vol. 84, Issue 323, March\n2010)\nObverse of these tiny 2 cm. dia. tablets show some incised markings. It is\nunclear from the markings if they can be compared with any glyphs of the\nIndus script corpora. They may be \u2018personal\u2019 markings like \u2018potter\u2019s marks\u2019 \u2013\ndesignating a particular artisan\u2019s workshop (working platform) or considering\nthe short numerical strokes used, the glyphs may be counters (numbers or liquid or weight measures). More precise determination may be made if more evidences of such glyphs are discovered. Excavators surmise that the three tablets with different motifs on the obverse of the three tablets suggest different users/uses. They may be from different workshops of the same guild but as the other side of the tables showed, the product taken from three workshops is the same.\nIt is possible that the markings on the obverse of the three Kanmer tablets (as tallies) were markings using a form of kharo\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b proto-syllabary as follows, possibly indicting some quantitative measures of the products delivered to the furnace account scribe of turned (forged) native metal : kharo\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b numeral \u2018twenty\u2019 kharo\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b numeral \u2018two\u2019. kharo\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b numeral \u2018one\u2019. kharo\u1e63\u1e6d\u012b syllable (\u1e6dha- for \u1e6dhakkura \u2018blacksmith\u2019?)\nGlyph: One long linear stroke. ko\u1e0da \u2018one\u2019 (Santali) Rebus: ko\u1e0d \u2018artisan\u2019s workshop\u2019 (Kuwi) Glyph: me\u1e0d\n\u2018body\u2019 (Mu.)

It is also possible that a seal impression on a bulla might have authenticated the bill of lading together with the three tablets (seal impressions) of Kanmer.\nThe hole on the following tablets may also have been strung together to create a tally of products delivered into the warehouse \u2018for\napproval\u2019, [j\u0101\u1e45ga\u1e0da] (Marathi).

We know in fact from the study of the non-Indo-European element in the Sanskrit lexicon that at the time of the earliest Sanskrit records, the R.gveda, when Sanskrit speakers were localized no further east than the Panjab, there were already a few Dravidian words current in Sanskrit. This involves a localization of Dravidian speech in this area no lather than three millennia ago. It also of course means much bilingualism and gradual abandonment of Dravidian speech in favor of IndoAryan over a long period and a great area-a process for which we have only the most llsd of evidence in detail. Similar relationships must have existed between Indo-Aryan and Munda and between Dravidian and Munda, but it is still almost impossible to be sure of either of these in detail... The Dravidian languages all have many Indo-Aryan items, borrowed at all periods from Sanskrit, Middle Indo-Aryan and Modern Indo-Aryan. The Munda languages likewise have much Indo-Aryan material, chiefly, so far as we know now, borrowed rom Modern Indo-Aryan, thogh this of course llsdes items that are Sanskrit in form, since Modern Indo-Aryan borrows from Sanskrit very considerably.

ISBN: 978-8120823228) has to be expanded further to provide for a study of evolution and formation of Indian languages in the Indian language union (sprachbund). The paper analyses the stages in the evolution of early writing systems which began with the evolution of counting in the ancient Near East. Providing an example from the Indian Hieroglyphs used in Indus Script as a writing system, a stage anterior to the stage of syllabic representation of sounds of a language, is identified. Unique geometric shapes required for tokens to categorize objects became too large to handle to abstract hundreds of categories of goods and metallurgical processes during the production of bronze-age goods. In such a situation, it became necessary to use glyphs which could distinctly identify, orthographically, specific descriptions of or cataloging of ores, alloys, and metallurgical processes. About 3500 BCE, Indus script as a writing system was developed to use hieroglyphs to represent the \u2018spoken words\u2019 identifying each of the goods and processes. A rebus method of representing similar sounding words of the lingua franca of the artisans was used in Indus script. This method is recognized and consistently applied for the lingua franca of the Indian sprachbund. That the ancient languages of India, constituted a sprachbund (or language union) is now recognized by many linguists. The sprachbund area is proximate to the area where most of the Indus script inscriptions were discovered, as documented in the corpora. That hundreds of Indian hieroglyphs continued to be used in metallurgy is evidenced by their use on early punch-marked coins. This explains the combined use of syllabic scripts such as Brahmi and Kharoshti together with the hieroglyphs on Rampurva copper bolt, and Sohgaura copper plate from about 6 th century BCE.Indian hieroglyphs constitute a writing system for meluhha language and are rebus representations of archaeo-metallurgy lexemes. The rebus principle was employed by the early scripts and can legitimately be used to decipher the Indus script, after secure pictorial identification.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007"}}}
