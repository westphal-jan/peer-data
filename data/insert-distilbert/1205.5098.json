INTRODUCTION\nMulti-criteria group decision making (MCGDM) problems are frequently encountered in practice. Several methods exist that can be applied to solve such problems. One example scenario of a MCGDM problem is where a group of two persons (A and B) intends to determine which laptop to buy based on certain criteria. Let\u2019s say they have evaluation criteria such as: price, screen size, memory and battery life. Each decision maker can have different importance for different criteria. For example, relative importance of criteria for A can be: price > battery life > memory > screen size. Here > means greater than. For B it can be some different ordering of criteria. Given this scenario, and a set of laptop alternatives, one wants to find which alternative best meets the group\u2019s criteria.\nFuzzy TOPSIS is a method that can help in objective and systematic evaluation of alternatives on multiple criteria. In Section II we provide a simplified description of required Fuzzy theory concepts. TOPSIS steps are explained in Section III, and an example scenario has been worked out in Section IV to illustrate the TOPSIS steps."}, {"heading": "II. FUZZY THEORY DETAILS", "text": "A detailed introduction and treatment of the fuzzy set theory is available in [1], [2]. The definitions of fuzzy concepts that are relevant for understanding of TOPSIS have been adapted from these sources. These definitions are presented as follows.\nDefinition 1: A fuzzy set a\u0303 in a universe of discourse X is characterized by a membership function \u00b5a\u0303(x) that maps each element x in X to a real number in the interval [0, 1]. The function value \u00b5a\u0303(x) is termed the grade of membership of x in a\u0303. The nearer the value of \u00b5a\u0303(x) to unity, the higher the grade of membership of x in a\u0303.\nDefinition 2: A triangular fuzzy number is represented as a triplet a\u0303 = (a1, a2, a3). The membership function \u00b5a\u0303(x)\nTABLE I FUZZY RATINGS FOR LINGUISTIC VARIABLES\nFuzzy number Alternative Assessment QA Weights\n(1,1,3) Very Poor (VP) Very Low (VL) (1,3,5) Poor (P) Low (L) (3,5,7) Fair (F) Medium (M) (5,7,9) Good (G) High (H) (7,9,9) Very Good (VG) Very High (VH)\nof triangular fuzzy number a\u0303 is given as:\n\u00b5a\u0303(x) =\n\n\n\nx\u2212a1 a2\u2212a1 if a1 \u2264 x \u2264 a2 a3\u2212x a3\u2212a2\nif a2 \u2264 x \u2264 a3 0 Otherwise\n(1)\nwhere a1, a2, a3 are real numbers and a1\u00a1a2\u00a1a3. The value of x at a2 gives the maximal grade of \u00b5a\u0303(x), i.e., \u00b5a\u0303(x) = 1; it is the most probable value of the evaluation data. The value of x at a1 gives the minimal grade of \u00b5a\u0303(x), i.e., \u00b5a\u0303(x) = 0; it is the least probable value of the evaluation data. Constants a1 and a3 are the lower and upper bounds of the available area for the evaluation data. These constants reflect the fuzziness of the evaluation data. The narrower the interval [a1, a3] the lower the fuzziness of the evaluation data."}, {"heading": "A. The distance between fuzzy triangular numbers", "text": "Let a\u0303 = (a1, a2, a3) and b\u0303 = (b1, b2, b3) be two triangular fuzzy numbers.

In this paper, we will apply a scale of 1 to 9 for rating the criteria and the alternatives. Following are the linguistic variables and fuzzy ratings for the alternatives and the criteria:\nThe values for the triangular fuzzy numbers that we have chosen for the linguistic variables take into consideration the fuzziness and the distance among the variables (please see equations 1 and 2). The intervals are chosen so as to have a uniform representation from 1 to 9 for the fuzzy triangular numbers used for the five linguistic ratings. For instance, one can also choose (4,5,6) instead of (1,1,3) to represent Very Low if one wishes so, however in that case, the \u201c1 to 9\u201d ratings would begin from 4 instead of 1. Normalization step takes care\nof such shifting of the rating scale. The common practice in literature is to start the ratings scales from 1."}, {"heading": "III. FUZZY TOPSIS", "text": "The technique called fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Situation) can be used to evaluate multiple alternatives against the selected criteria. In the TOPSIS approach an alternative that is nearest to the Fuzzy Positive Ideal Solution (FPIS) and farthest from the Fuzzy Negative Ideal Solution (FNIS) is chosen as optimal. An FPIS is composed of the best performance values for each alternative whereas the FNIS consists of the worst performance values. A detailed description and treatment of TOPSIS is discussed by [1], [3] and we have adapted the relevant steps of fuzzy TOPSIS as presented below.\nLet\u2019s say the decision group has K members. If the fuzzy rating and importance weight of the kth decision maker, about the ith alternative on jth criterion, are: x\u0303kij = (a k ij , b k ij , c k ij) and w\u0303 k j = (w k j1, w k j2, w k j3) respectively, where i = 1, 2, . . . ,m, and j = 1, 2, . . . , n, then the aggregated fuzzy ratings x\u0303ij of alternatives (i) with respect to each criterion (j) are given by x\u0303ij = (aij , bij , cij) such that:\naij = min k\n{akij}, bij = 1\nK\nK \u2211\nk=1\nbkij , cij = max k {ckij} (3)\nThe aggregated fuzzy weights (w\u0303ij ) of each criterion are calculated as w\u0303kj = (wj1, wj2, wj3) where:\nwj1 = min k\n{wjk1}, wj2 = 1\nK\nK \u2211\nk=1\nwjk2, wj3 = max k {wjk3}\n(4)\nA fuzzy multicriteria Group Decision Making (GDM) problem which can be concisely expressed in matrix format as:\nD\u0303 =\n\n  \nC1 C2 Cn\nA1 x\u030311 x\u030312 . . . x\u03031n A2 x\u030321 x\u030322 . . . x\u03032n\n. . . . . . x\u0303ij . . .\nAm x\u0303m1 x\u0303m2 . . . x\u0303mn\n\n  \n(5)\nW\u0303 = (w\u03031, w\u03032, . . . , w\u0303n) (6)\nwhere x\u0303ij , \u2200i, j and w\u0303j , i = 1, 2, . . . ,m; j = 1, 2, . . . , n are linguistic variables which can be described by triangular fuzzy numbers, x\u0303ij = (aij , bij , cij) and w\u0303j = (wj1, wj2, wj3). To keep the normalization formula simple, the linear scale transformation is used to transform various criteria scales into a comparable scale. Thus, we have the normalized fuzzy decision matrix as:\nR\u0303 = [r\u0303ij ]m\u00d7n, i = 1, 2, . . . ,m; j = 1, 2, . . . , n (7)\nwhere:\nr\u0303ij =\n(\naij c\u2217j , bij c\u2217j , cij c\u2217j\n)\nand\nc\u2217j = max i cij (benefit criteria)\n\n \n  \n(8)\nr\u0303ij =\n(\na\u2212j cij , a\u2212j bij , a\u2212j aij\n)\nand\na\u2212j = min i aij (cost criteria)\n\n  \n  \n(9)\nThe above normalization method preserves the property that the ranges of normalized triangular fuzzy numbers belong to [0, 1].\nThe weighted normalized fuzzy decision matrix V\u0303 is computed by multiplying the weights (w\u0303j) of evaluation criteria with the normalized fuzzy decision matrix r\u0303ij as:\nV\u0303 = [v\u0303ij ]m\u00d7n, i = 1, 2, . . . ,m; j = 1, 2, . . . , n\nwhere v\u0303ij = r\u0303ij(\u00b7)w\u0303j (10)\nThe FPIS and FNIS of the alternatives are defined as follows:\nA\u2217 = (v\u0303\u22171 , v\u0303 \u2217 2 , . . . , v\u0303 \u2217 n) where\nv\u0303\u2217j = max i\n{vij3}, i = 1, 2 . . . ,m; j = 1, 2, . . . , n (11)\nA\u2212 = (v\u0303\u2212 1 , v\u0303\u2212 2 , . . . , v\u0303\u2212n ) where\nv\u0303\u2212j = min i {vij1}, i = 1, 2 . . . ,m; j = 1, 2, . . . , n\n(12)\nThe distance (d\u2217i and d \u2212 i ) of each weighted alternative i = 1, 2, . . . ,m from the FPIS and the FNIS is computed as follows:\nd\u2217i =\nn \u2211\nj=1\ndv(v\u0303ij , v\u0303 \u2217 j ), i = 1, 2, . . . ,m (13)\nd\u2212i =\nn \u2211\nj=1\ndv(v\u0303ij , v\u0303 \u2212 j ), i = 1, 2, . . . ,m (14)\nwhere dv(a\u0303, b\u0303) is the distance measurement between two fuzzy number a\u0303 and b\u0303.\nThe closeness coefficient CCi represents the distances to fuzzy positive ideal solution, A\u2217, and the fuzzy negative ideal solution, A\u2212 simultaneously. The closeness coefficient of each alternative is calculated as:\nCCi = d\u2212i\nd\u2212i + d \u2217 i\n, i = 1, 2 . . . ,m (15)\nThe alternative with highest closeness coefficient represents the best alternative and is closest to the FPIS and farthest from\nthe FNIS. In summary, the TOPSIS steps that we use are as below:\ni. Aggregate the weight of criteria to get the aggregated fuzzy weight w\u0303j of criterion Cj (using equation 4) and pool the decision makers\u2019 ratings to get the aggregated fuzzy rating x\u0303ij of alternative Ai under criterion Cj (using equation 3).\nii. Construct the fuzzy decision matrix and the normalized fuzzy decision matrix (equations 7, 8 and 9).\niii. Construct the weighted normalized fuzzy decision matrix (equation 10). iv. Determine FPIS and FNIS and calculate the distance of each alternative from FPIS and FNIS, respectively (equations 11, 12, 13 and 14).\nv. Calculate the closeness coefficient of each alternative and rank the alternatives (equation 15)."}, {"heading": "IV.
