A multi-task learning (MTL) algorithm learns an inductive bias to learn several tasks together. MTL is incredibly pervasive in machine learning: it has natural connections to random effects models [15]; user preference prediction (including collaborative filtering) can be framed as MTL [16]; multi-class classification admits the popular one-vs-all and all-pairs MTL reductions; and MTL admits provably good learning in settings where single-task learning is hopeless [4, 12]. But if we see examples from a random set of tasks today, which of these tasks will matter tomorrow? Not knowing in the present what challenges nature has in store for the future, a sensible strategy is to mitigate the worst case by ensuring some minimum proficiency on each task.\nConsider a simple learning scenario: A music preference prediction company is in the business of predicting what 5-star ratings different users would assign to songs. At training time, the company learns a shared representation for predicting the users\u2019 song ratings by pooling together the company\u2019s limited data on each user\u2019s preferences. Given this learned representation, a separate predictor for each user can be trained very quickly. At test time, the environment draws a user according to some (possibly randomized) rule and solicits from the company a prediction of that user\u2019s preference for a particular song. The environment may also ask for predictions about new users, described by a few ratings each, and so the company must leverage its existing representation to rapidly learn new predictors and produce ratings for these new users.\nClassically, multi-task learning has sought to minimize the (regularized) sum of the empirical risks over a set of tasks. In this way, classical MTL implicitly assumes that once the learner has been trained, it will be tested on test tasks drawn uniformly at random from the empirical task distribution of the training tasks. Notably, there are several reasons why classical MTL may not be ideal:\n\u2217Work completed while at Georgia Institute of Technology\nar X\niv :1\n20 9.\n27 84\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n1 3\nSe p\n\u2022 While at training time the usual flavor of MTL commits to a fixed distribution over users (typically either uniform or proportional to the number of ratings available for each user), at test time there is no guarantee what user distribution we will encounter. In fact, there may not exist any fixed user distribution: the sequence of users for which ratings are elicited could be adversarial.\n\u2022 Even in the case when the distribution over tasks is not adversarial, it may be in the interest of the music preference prediction company to guarantee some minimum level of accuracy per user in order to minimize negative feedback and a potential loss of business, rather than maximing the mean level of accuracy over all users.\n\u2022 Whereas minimizing the average prediction error is very much a teleological endeavor, typically at the expense of some locally egregious outcomes, minimizing the worst-case prediction error respects a notion of fairness to all tasks (or people).\nThis work introduces minimax multi-task learning as a response to the above scenario.1 In addition, we cast a spectrum of multi-task learning. At one end of the spectrum lies minimax MTL, and departing from this point progressively relaxes the \u201chardness\u201d of the maximum until full relaxation reaches the second endpoint and recovers classical MTL. We further sculpt a generalized loss-compositional paradigm for MTL which includes this spectrum and several other new MTL formulations. This paradigm equally applies to the problem of learning to learn (LTL), in which the goal is to learn a hypothesis space from a set of training tasks such that this representation admits good hypotheses on future tasks. In truth, MTL and LTL typically are handled equivalently at training time \u2014 this work will be no exception \u2014 and they diverge only in their test settings and hence the learning theoretic inquiries they inspire.\nContributions. The first contribution of this work is to introduce minimax MTL and a continuum of relaxations. Second, we introduce a generalized loss-compositional paradigm for MTL which admits a number of new MTL formulations and also includes classical MTL as a special case. Third, we empirically evaluate the performance of several MTL formulations from this paradigm in the multi-task learning and learning to learn settings, under the task-wise maximum test risk and task-wise mean test risk criteria, on four datasets (one synthetic, three real). Finally, Theorem 1 is the core theoretical contribution of this work and shows the following: If it is possible to obtain maximum empirical risk across a set of training tasks below some level \u03b3, then it is likely that the maximum true risk obtained by the learner on a new task is bounded by roughly \u03b3. Hence, if the goal is to minimize the worst case outcome over new tasks, the theory suggests minimizing the maximum of the empirical risks across the training tasks rather than their mean.\nIn the next section, we recall the settings of multi-task learning and learning to learn, formally introduce minimax MTL, and motivate it theoretically. In Section 3, we introduce a continuously parametrized family of minimax MTL relaxations and the new generalized loss-compositional paradigm. Section 4 presents an empirical evaluation of various MTL/LTL formulations with different models on four datasets. Finally, we close with a discussion."}, {"heading": "2 Minimax multi-task learning", "text": "We begin with a promenade through the basic MTL and LTL setups, with an effort to abide by the notation introduced by Baxter [4]. Throughout the rest of the paper, each labeled example (x, y) will live in X \u00d7 Y for input instance x and label y. Typical choices of X include Rn or a compact subset thereof, while Y typically is a compact subset of R or the binary {\u22121, 1}. In addition, define a loss function ` : R \u00d7 Y \u2192 R+. For simplicity, this work considers `2 loss (squared loss) `(y\u2032, y) = (y\u2032 \u2212 y)2 for regression and hinge loss `(y\u2032, y) = max{0, 1\u2212 y\u2032y} for classification. MTL and LTL often are framed as applying an inductive bias to learn a common hypothesis space, selected from a fixed family of hypothesis spaces, and thereafter learning from this hypothesis space a hypothesis for each task observed at training time. It will be useful to formalize the various sets and elements present in the preceding statement. Let H be a family of hypothesis spaces. Any hypothesis spaceH \u2208 H itself is a set of hypotheses; each hypothesis h \u2208 H is a map h : X \u2192 R.\n1Note that minimax MTL does not refer to the minimax estimators of statistical decision theory.\nLearning to learn. In learning to learn, the goal is to achieve inductive transfer to learn the best H from H. Unlike in MTL, there is a notion of an environment of tasks: an unknown probability measureQ over a space of task probability measuresP . The goal is to find the optimal representation via the objective\ninf H\u2208H EP\u223cQ inf h\u2208H E(x,y)\u223cP `(y, h(x)). (1)\nIn practice, T (unobservable) training task probability measures P1, . . . , PT \u2208 P are drawn iid from Q, and from each task t a set of m examples are drawn iid from Pt.\nMulti-task learning. Whereas in learning to learn there is a distribution over tasks, in multi-task learning there is a fixed, finite set of tasks indexed by [T ] := {1, . . . , T}. Each task t \u2208 [T ] is coupled with a fixed but unknown probability measure Pt. Classically, the goal of MTL is to minimize the expected loss at test time under the uniform distribution on [T ]:\ninf H\u2208H\n1\nT \u2211 t\u2208[T ] inf h\u2208H E(x,y)\u223cPt`(y, h(x)). (2)\nNotably, this objective is equivalent to (1) when Q is the uniform distribution on {P1, . . . , PT }. In terms of the data generation model, MTL differs from LTL since the tasks are fixed; however, just as in LTL, from each task t a set of m examples are drawn iid from Pt ."}, {"heading": "2.1 Minimax MTL", "text": "A natural generalization of classical MTL results by introducing a prior distribution \u03c0 over the index set of tasks [T ]. Given \u03c0, the (idealized) objective of this generalized MTL is\ninf H\u2208H Et\u223c\u03c0 inf h\u2208H E(x,y)\u223cPt`(y, h(x)), (3)\ngiven only the training data {(xt,1, yt,1), . . . , (xt,m, yt,m)}t\u2208[T ]. The classical MTL objective (2) equals (3) when \u03c0 is taken to be the uniform prior over [T ]. We argue that in many instances, that which is most relevant to minimize is not the expected error under a uniform distribution over tasks, or even any pre-specified \u03c0, but rather the expected error for the worst \u03c0. We propose to minimize the maximum error over tasks under an adversarial choice of \u03c0, yielding the objective:\ninf H\u2208H sup \u03c0 Et\u223c\u03c0 inf h\u2208H E(x,y)\u223cPt`(y, h(x)),\nwhere the supremum is taken over the T -dimensional simplex. As the supremum (assuming it is attained) is attained at an extreme point of the simplex, this objective is equivalent to\ninf H\u2208H max t\u2208[T ] inf h\u2208H E(x,y)\u223cPt`(y, h(x)).

In this short paper, we restrict attention to the case of finite H."}, {"heading": "2.2 A learning to learn bound for the maximum risk", "text": "In this subsection, we use the following notation. Let P (1), . . . , P (T ) be probability measures drawn iid from Q, and for t \u2208 [T ] let z(t) be an m-sample (a sample of m points) from P (t) with corresponding empirical measure P (t)m . Also, if P is as a probability measure then P`\u25e6h := E`(y, h(x)); similarly, if Pm is an empirical measure, then Pm` \u25e6 h := 1m \u2211m i=1 `(yi, h(xi)).\nOur focus is the learning to learn setting with a minimax lens: when one learns a representation H \u2208 H from multiple training tasks and observes maximum empirical risk \u03b3, we would like to\nguarantee thatH\u2019s true risk on a newly drawn test task will be bounded by roughly \u03b3. Such a goal is in striking contrast to the classical emphasis of learning to learn, where the goal is to obtain bounds on H\u2019s expected true risk. Using H\u2019s expected true risk and Markov\u2019s inequality, Baxter [4, the display prior to (25) ] showed that the probability that H\u2019s true risk on a newly drawn test task is above some level \u03b3 decays as the expected true risk over \u03b3:\nPr { inf h\u2208H P` \u25e6 h \u2265 \u03b3 } \u2264 1 T \u2211 t\u2208[T ] P (t) m ` \u25e6 ht + \u03b5 \u03b3\n(5)\nwhere the size of \u03b5 is controlled by T , m, and the complexities of certain spaces.\nThe expected true risk is not of primary interest for controlling the tail of the (random) true risk, and a more direct approach yields a much better bound. In this short paper we restrict the space of representations H to be finite with cardinality C; in this case, the analysis is particularly simple and illuminates the idea for proving the general case. The next theorem is the main result of this section: Theorem 1. Let |H| = C, and let the loss ` be L-Lipschitz in its second argument and bounded by B. Suppose T tasks P (1), . . . , P (T ) are drawn iid from Q and from each task P (t) an iid m-sample z(t) is drawn. Suppose there exists H \u2208 H such that all t \u2208 [T ] satisfy minh\u2208H P (t)m ` \u25e6 h \u2264 \u03b3. Let P be newly drawn probability measure from Q. Let h\u0302 be the empirical risk minimizer over the test m-sample. With probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4 with respect to the random draw of the T tasks and their T corresponding m-samples:\nPr P` \u25e6 h\u0302 > \u03b3 + 1T + 2LmaxH\u2208HRm(H) + \u221a 8 log 4\u03b4 m  \u2264 log 2C\u03b4 + logdBe+ log(T + 1)T . (6) In the above,Rm(H) is the Rademacher complexity ofH (cf. [3]). Critically, in (6) the probability of observing a task with high true risk decays with T , whereas in (5) the decay is independent of T . Hence, when the goal is to minimize the probability of bad performance on future tasks uniformly, this theorem motivates minimizing the maximum of the empirical risks as opposed to their mean.\nFor the proof of Theorem 1, first consider the singleton case H = {H1}. Suppose that for \u03b3 fixed a priori, the maximum of the empirical risks is bounded by \u03b3, i.e. maxt\u2208[T ] minh\u2208H1 P (t) m ` \u25e6 h \u2264 \u03b3.\nLet a new probability measure P drawn from Q correspond to a new test task. Suppose the probability of the event [minh\u2208H1 Pm` \u25e6 h > \u03b3] is at least \u03b5. Then the probability that \u03b3 bounds all T empirical risks is at most (1\u2212 \u03b5)T \u2264 e\u2212T\u03b5. Hence, with probability at least 1\u2212 e\u2212T\u03b5:\nPr {minh\u2208H1 Pm` \u25e6 h > \u03b3} \u2264 \u03b5. (7)\nA simple application of the union bound extends this result for finite H: Lemma 1. Under the same conditions as Theorem 1, with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4/2 with respect to the random draw of the T tasks and their T corresponding m-samples:\nPr { min h\u2208H Pm` \u25e6 h > \u03b3 } \u2264 log 2C\u03b4 T . (8)\nThe bound in the lemma states a 1/T rate of decay for the probability that the empirical risk obtained by H on a new task exceeds \u03b3. Next, we relate this empirical risk with the true risk obtained by the empirical risk minimizer. Note that at test time H is fixed and hence independent of any test msample. Then, from by now standard learning theory results of Bartlett and Mendelson [3]: Lemma 2. Take loss ` as in Theorem 1. With probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4/2, for all h \u2208 H uniformly:\nP` \u25e6 h \u2264 Pm` \u25e6 h+ 2LRm(H) + \u221a (8 log(4/\u03b4))/m. (9)\nIn particular, with high probability the true risk of the empirical risk minimizer is not much larger than its empirical risk. Theorem 1 now follows from Lemmas 1 and 2 and a union bound over \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 := {0, 1/T, 2/T, . . . , dBe}; note that mapping the observed maximum empirical risk \u03b3 to min{\u03b3\u2032 \u2208 \u0393 | \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b3\u2032} picks up the additional 1T term in (6). In the next section, we introduce a loss-compositional paradigm for multi-task learning which includes as special cases minimax MTL and classical MTL."}, {"heading": "3 A generalized loss-compositional paradigm for MTL", "text": "The paradigm can benefit from a bit of notation. Given a set of T tasks, we represent the empirical risk for hypothesis ht \u2208 H (\u2208 H) on task t \u2208 [T ] as \u02c6\u0300t(ht) := \u2211m i=1 `(yt,i, ht(xt,i)). Additionally define a set of hypotheses for multiple tasks h := (h1, . . . , hT ) \u2208 HT and the vector of empirical risks \u02c6\u0300(h) := (\u02c6\u03001(h1), . . . , \u02c6\u0300T (hT )).\nWith this notation set, the proposed loss-compositional paradigm encompasses any regularized minimization of a (typically convex) function \u03c6 : RT+ \u2192 R+ of the empirical risks:\ninf H\u2208H inf h\u2208HT\n\u03c6 ( \u02c6\u0300(h) ) + \u2126 ( (H,h) ) , (10)\nwhere \u2126(\u00b7) : H\u00d7 \u222aH\u2208HHT \u2192 R+ is a regularizer.\n`p MTL. One notable specialization that is still quite general is the case when \u03c6 is an `p-norm, yielding `p MTL. This subfamily encompasses classical MTL and many new MTL formulations:\n\u2022 Classical MTL as `1 MTL:\ninf H\u2208H inf h\u2208HT\n1\nT \u2211 t\u2208[T ] \u02c6\u0300(ht) + \u2126 ( (H,h) ) \u2261 inf H\u2208H inf h\u2208HT 1 T \u2016 \u02c6\u0300(h)\u20161 + \u2126 ( (H,h) ) .\n\u2022 Minimax MTL as `\u221e MTL: inf H\u2208H inf h\u2208HT max t\u2208[T ] \u02c6\u0300(ht) + \u2126 ( (H,h) ) \u2261 inf H\u2208H inf h\u2208HT \u2016 \u02c6\u0300(h)\u2016\u221e + \u2126 ( (H,h) ) .\n\u2022 A new formulation, `2 MTL:\ninf H\u2208H inf h\u2208HT ( 1 T \u2211 t\u2208[T ] ( \u02c6\u0300(ht) )2)1/2 + \u2126 ( (H,h) ) \u2261 inf H\u2208H inf h\u2208HT 1\u221a T \u2016 \u02c6\u0300(h)\u20162 + \u2126 ( (H,h) ) .\nA natural question is why one might consider minimizing `p-norms of the empirical risks vector for 1 < p < \u221e, as in `2 MTL. The contour of the `1-norm of the empirical risks evenly trades off empirical risks between different tasks; however, it has been observed that overfitting often happens near the end of learning, rather than the beginning [14]. More precisely, when the empirical risk is high, the gradient of the empirical risk (taken with respect to the parameter (H,h)) is likely to have positive inner product with the gradient of the true risk. Therefore, given a candidate solution with a corresponding vector of empirical risks, a sensible strategy is to take a step in solution space which places more emphasis on tasks with higher empirical risk. This strategy is particularly appropriate when the class of learners has high capacity relative to the amount of available data. This observation sets the foundation for an approach that minimizes norms of the empirical risks.\nIn this work, we also discuss an interesting subset of the loss-compositional paradigm which does not fit into `p MTL; this subfamily embodies a continuum of relaxations of minimax MTL.\n\u03b1-minimax MTL. In some cases, minimizing the maximum loss can exhibit certain disadvantages because the maximum loss is not robust to situations when a small fraction of the tasks are fundamentally harder than the remaining tasks. Consider the case when the empirical risk for each task in this small fraction can not be reduced below a level u. Rather than rigidly minimizing the maximum loss, a more robust alternative is to minimize the maximize loss in a soft way. Intuitively, the idea is to ensure that most tasks have low empirical risk, but a small fraction of tasks are permitted to have higher loss. We formalize this as \u03b1-minimax MTL, via the relaxed objective:\nminimize H\u2208H,h\u2208HT min b\u22650\n{ b+ 1\n\u03b1 \u2211 t\u2208[T ] max{0, \u02c6\u0300t(ht)\u2212 b} } + \u2126 ( (H,h) ) . (11)\nIn the above, \u03c6 from the loss-compositional paradigm (10) is a variational function of the empirical risks vector. The above optimization problem is equivalent to the perhaps more intuitive problem:\nminimize H\u2208H,h\u2208HT ,b\u22650,\u03be\u22650\nb+ 1\n\u03b1 \u2211 t\u2208[T ] \u03bet + \u2126 ( (H,h) ) subject to \u02c6\u0300t(ht) \u2264 b+ \u03bet, t \u2208 [T ]. (12)\nHere, b plays the role of the relaxed maximum, and each \u03bet\u2019s deviation from zero indicates the deviation from the (loosely enforced) maximum. We expect \u03be to be sparse.\nTo help understand how \u03b1 affects the learning problem, let us consider a few cases:\n(1) When \u03b1 > T , the optimal value of b is zero, and the problem is equivalent to classical MTL. To see this, note that for a given candidate solution with b > 0 the objective always can be reduced by reducing b by some \u03b5 and increasing each \u03bet by the same \u03b5.\n(2) Suppose one task is much harder than all the other tasks (e.g. an outlier task), and its empirical risk is separated from the maximum empirical risk of the other tasks by \u03c1. Let 1 < \u03b1 < 2; now, at the optimal hard maximum solution (where \u03be = 0), the objective can be reduced by increasing one of the \u03bet\u2019s by \u03c1 and decreasing b by \u03c1. Thus, the objective can focus on minimizing the maximum risk of the set of T \u2212 1 easier tasks. In this special setting, this argument can be extended to the more general case k < \u03b1 < k + 1 and k outlier tasks, for k \u2208 [T ].\n(3) As \u03b1 approaches 0, we recover the hard maximum case of minimax MTL.\nThis work focuses on \u03b1-minimax MTL with \u03b1 = 2/(d0.1T + 0.5e\u22121 + d0.1T + 1.5e\u22121) i.e. the harmonic mean of d0.1T + 0.5e and d0.1T + 1.5e. The reason for this choice is that in the idealized case (2) above, for large T this setting of \u03b1 makes the relaxed maximum consider all but the hardest 10% of the tasks. We also try the 20% level (i.e. 0.2T replacing 0.1T in the above).\nModels. We now provide examples of how specific models fit into this framework. We consider two convex multi-task learning formulations: Evgeniou and Pontil\u2019s regularized multi-task learning (the EP model) [5] and Argyriou, Evgeniou, and Pontil\u2019s convex multi-task feature learning (the AEP model) [1]. The EP model is a linear model with a shared parameter v0 \u2208 Rd and task-specific parameters vt \u2208 Rd (for t \u2208 [T ]). Evgeniou and Pontil presented this model as\nminv0,{vt}t\u2208[T ] \u2211 t\u2208[T ] \u2211m i=1 `(yt,i, \u3008v0 + vt, xt,i\u3009) + \u03bb0\u2016v0\u20162 + \u03bb1 T \u2211 t\u2208[T ] \u2016vt\u20162, (13)\nfor ` the hinge loss or squared loss. This can be set in the new paradigm via H = {Hv0 | v0 \u2208 Rd}, Hv0 = {h : x 7\u2192 \u3008v0 + vt, x\u3009 | vt \u2208 Rd}, and \u02c6\u0300t(ht) = 1m \u2211m i=1 ` ( yt,i, \u3008v0 + vt, xt,i\u3009 ) .\nThe AEP model minimizes the task-wise average loss with the trace norm (nuclear norm) penalty: minW \u2211 t \u2211m i=1 `(yt,i, \u3008Wt, xt,i\u3009) + \u03bb\u2016W\u2016tr, (14)\nwhere \u2016\u00b7\u2016tr : W 7\u2192 \u2211 i \u03c3i(W ) is the trace norm. In the new paradigm, H is a set where each element is a k-dimensional subspace of linear estimators (for k d). Each ht = Wt in some H \u2208 H lives inH\u2019s corresponding low-dimensional subspace. Also, \u02c6\u0300t(ht) = 1m \u2211m i=1 ` ( yt,i, \u3008ht, xt,i\u3009 ) .\nFor easy empirical comparison between the various MTL formulations from the paradigm, at times it will be convenient to use constrained formulations of the EP and AEP model. If the regularized forms are used, a fair comparison of the methods warrants plotting results according to the size of the optimal parameter found (i.e. \u2016W\u2016tr for AEP). For EP, the constrained form is: minv0,{vt}t\u2208[T ] \u2211 t\u2208[T ] \u2211m i=1 `(yt,i, \u3008v0 + vt, xt,i\u3009) subject to \u2016v0\u2016 \u2264 \u03c40, \u2016vt\u2016 \u2264 \u03c41 for t \u2208 [T ].\nFor AEP, the constrained form is: minW \u2211 t \u2211m i=1 `(yt,i, \u3008Wt, xt,i\u3009) subject to \u2016W\u2016tr \u2264 r."}, {"heading": "4 Empirical evaluation", "text": "We consider four learning problems; the first three involve regression (MTL model in parentheses): \u2022 A synthetic dataset composed from two modes of tasks (EP model), \u2022 The school dataset from the Inner London Education Authority (EP model), \u2022 The conjoint analysis personal computer ratings dataset 2 [11] (AEP model).\nThe fourth problem is multi-class classification from the MNIST digits dataset [10] with a reduction to multi-task learning using a tournament of pairwise (binary) classifiers. We use the AEP model. Given data, each problem involved a choice of MTL formulation (e.g. minimax MTL), model (EP or AEP), and choice of regularized versus constrained. All the problems were solved using just a few lines of code using CVX [9, 8]. In this work, we considered convex multi-task learning formulations in order to make clear statements about the optimal solutions attained for various learning problems.\n2This data, collected at the University of Michigan MBA program, generously was provided by Peter Lenk.\nTwo modes. The two modes regression problem consists of 50 linear prediction tasks for the first type of task and 5 linear prediction tasks for the second task type. The true parameter for the first task type is a vector \u00b5 drawn uniformly from the sphere of radius 5; the true parameter for the second task type is \u22122\u00b5. Each task is drawn from an isotropic Gaussian with mean taken from the task type and the standard deviation of all dimensions set to \u03c3task. Each data point for each task is drawn from a product of 10 standard normals (so xt,i \u2208 R10). The targets are generated according to \u3008Wt, xt,i\u3009 + \u03b5t, where the \u03b5t\u2019s are iid univariate centered normals with standard deviation \u03c3noise. We fixed \u03c40 to a large value (in this case, \u03c40 = 10 is sufficient since the mean for the largest task fits into a ball of radius 10) and \u03c41 to a small value (\u03c41 = 2). We compute the average mean and maximum test error over 100 instances of the 55-task multi-task problem. Each task\u2019s training set and test set are 5 and 15 points respectively. The average maximum (mean) test error is the 100- experiment-average of the task-wise maximum (mean) of the `2 risks. For each LTL experiment, 55 new test tasks were drawn using the same \u00b5 as from the training tasks.\nFigure 1 shows a tradeoff: when each task group is fairly homogeneous (left and center plots), minimax is better at minimizing the maximum of the test risks while `1 is better at minimizing the mean of the test risks. As task homogeneity decreases (right plot), the gap in performance closes with respect to the maximum of the test risks and remains roughly the same with respect to the mean.\nSchool. The school dataset has appeared in many previous works [7, 2, 6]. For brevity we just say the goal is to predict student test scores using certain student-level features. Each school is treated as a separate task. We report both the task-wise maximum of the root mean square error (RMSE) and the taskwise-mean of the RMSE (normalized by number of points per task, as in previous works).\nThe results (see Figure 2) demonstrate that when the learner has moderate shared capacity \u03c40 and high task-specific capacity \u03c41, minimax MTL outperforms `1 MTL for the max objective; additionally, for the max objective in almost all parameter settings (0.1T )-minimax and (0.2T )-minimax MTL outperform `1 MTL, and they also outperform minimax MTL when the task-specific capacity \u03c41 is not too large. We hypothesize that minimax MTL performs the best in the high\u2212\u03c41 regime because stopping learning once the maximum of the empirical risks cannot be improved invokes early stopping and its built-in regularization properties (see e.g. [13]). Interestingly, for the normalized mean RMSE objective, both minimax relaxations are competitive with `1 MTL; however, when the\nshared capacity \u03c40 is high (right section, right plot), `1 MTL performs the best. For high task-specific capacity \u03c41, minimax MTL and its relaxations again seem to resist overfitting compared to `1 MTL.\nPersonal computer. The personal computer dataset is composed of 189 human subjects each of which rated on a 0-10 scale the same 20 computers (16 training, 4 test). Each computer has 13 binary features (amount of memory, screen size, price, etc.).\nThe results are shown in Figure 3. In the MTL setting, for both the maximum RMSE objective and the mean RMSE objective, `1 MTL appears to perform the best. When the trace norm of W is high, minimax MTL displays resistance to overfitting and obtains the lowest mean RMSE. In the LTL setting for the maximum RMSE objective, `2, minimax, and (0.1T )-minimax MTL all outperform `1 MTL. For the mean RMSE, `1 MTL obtains the lowest risk for almost all parameter setttings.\nMNIST. The MNIST task is a 10-class problem; we approach it via a reduction to a tournament of 45 binary classifiers trained via the AEP model. The dimensionality was reduced to 50 using principal component analysis (computed on the full training set), and only the first 2% of each class\u2019s training points was used for training.\nIntuitively, the performance of the tournament tree of binary classifiers can only be as accurate as its paths, and the accuracy of each path depends on the accuracy of the nodes. Hence, our hypothesis is that minimax MTL should outperform `1 MTL. The results in Figure 4 confirm our hypothesis. Minimax MTL outperforms `1 MTL when the capacity \u2016W\u2016tr is somewhat limited, with the gap widening as the capacity decreases. Furthermore, at every capacity minimax MTL is competitive with `1 MTL."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "We have established a continuum of formulations for MTL which recovers as special cases classical MTL and the newly formulated minimax MTL. In between these extreme points lies a continuum of relaxed minimax MTL formulations. More generally, we introduced a loss-compositional paradigm that operates on the vector of empirical risks, inducing the additional `p MTL paradigms. The empirical evaluations indicate that \u03b1-minimax MTL at either the 10% or 20% level often outperform `1 MTL in terms of the maximum test risk objective and sometimes even in the mean test risk objective. All the minimax or \u03b1-minimax MTL formulations exhibit a built-in safeguard against overfitting in the case of learning with a model that is very complex relative to the available data.\nAlthough efficient algorithms may make the various new MTL learning formulations practical for large problems, a proper effort to develop fast algorithms in this setting would have detracted from the main point of this first study. A good direction for the future is to obtain efficient algorithms for minimax and \u03b1-minimax MTL. In fact, such algorithms might have applications beyond MTL and even machine learning. Another area ripe for exploration is to establish more general learning bounds for minimax MTL and to extend these bounds to \u03b1-minimax MTL."}], "references": [{"title": "Convex multi-task feature learning", "author": ["A.
