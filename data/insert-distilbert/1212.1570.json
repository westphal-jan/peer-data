and the skills of an agent are introduced, implemented collectively and initially classified in two layers, the basicskills and the highlevel skills. in considering the second layer, a twophase mechanism for decision making is introduced. in phase one, some useful methods are implemented which check the agent's situation for performing required skills. in the next phase, after the team str ategy, team guidance for mation, agent's role and the agent's positioning system are introduced. a fuzzy logical approach is employed to recognize the chosen team strategy and further more to tell the player the best position when to move. at last, we comprised our implemented algor ithm in the robocup soccer simulation 3d environment and results showed th eefficiency of the introduced

and action  selection of  an  agent  in soccer simulation  3D  environment  are  presented. First,  the  skills of  an  agent  are  introduced,  implemented  and  classified  in  two layers, the basic\u00adskills and the high\u00adlevel skills. In the second layer, a   two\u00adphase mechanism  for   decision making  is  introduced.  In phase one,  some useful methods  are  implemented which  check the  agent\u2019s situation  for performing  required  skills.  In  the  next phase,  the  team  str ategy,  team  formation, agent\u2019s  role and  the agent\u2019s positioning system are introduced. A fuzzy logical approach is  employed  to  recognize  the  team str ategy  and  fur thermore  to tell  the  player  the  best  position  to move. At  last, we  comprised our   implemented  algor ithm  in  the  Robocup Soccer   Simulation 3D  environmen t   and   r esu lts  sh owed   the  eff iciency  of  t he introduced methodology.

Resumen\u2014En este  ar t\u00edculo se  presenta  un  nuevo m\u00e9todo  difuso hibr ido para  la  toma de decisiones  y selecci\u00f3n de acciones  de un agente en  un ambiente  de simulaci\u00f3n de f\u00fatbol 3D. Primero,  se introducen,  implementan y clasifican las competencias del agente en   dos  capas:  competencia s  b\u00e1sica s  y  competencias  de  n ivel superior. En  la segunda  capa se  introduce un mecanismo de  dos fases  par a  la  toma de  decisiones. En  la pr imera  fase, se  aplican algunos m\u00e9todos  \u00fatiles   que  permiten ver ificar   la situaci\u00f3n  del agente  par a  la  ejecuci\u00f3n de  las competencias  requeridas. En  la siguiente  fase,  se adicionan  la estrategia  y  formaci\u00f3n del equipo, y  el  rol  y sistema de posici\u00f3n  de  los  agentes.
