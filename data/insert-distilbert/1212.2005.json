However, as Bettini et al. (2002) observed: \u201cIt would greatly enhance the capabilities of current workflow systems if quantitative temporal constraints on the duration of activities and their synchronization requirements can be specified and reasoned about.\u201d Toward that end, Combi et al. (2007; 2009; 2010) presented a new workflow model that accommodates the following key features: tasks with uncertain/uncontrollable durations; temporal constraints among tasks; and branching paths, where the branch taken is not known in advance. Fig. 1 shows a sample workflow from the health-care domain, similar to one presented by Combi and Posenato (2009). In this workflow, all times are in minutes, and:\n\u2022 tasks are represented by rounded boxes; \u2022 branching points are represented by nine-sided boxes\ncalled split or join connectors1;\n\u2022 tasks and connectors have duration attributes, [x, y]; \u2217Funded in part by the Phoebe H.

For example, the notation S[136, 150]E on the arrow from T4 to T5 indicates that the duration of the interval from the start of T4 to the end of T5 must be in the range, [136, 150].\nThe tasks and their uncontrollable durations are:\nT1: Pre-hospital issues, 2\u20134 min.\nT2: Initial patient evaluation, 5\u201320 min.\nT3: Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, 25\u201345 min.\nT4: Reperfusion Fibrinolytic therapy, 80\u201390 min.\nT5: Ancillary therapy, 10\u201320 min.\nThe semantics of execution for workflows stipulates that:\nar X\niv :1\n21 2.\n20 05\nv1 [\ncs .A\nI] 1\n0 D\nec 2\n01 2\n\u2022 The agent is free to choose starting times for all tasks, but does not control their durations; instead, the agent merely observes the durations of tasks in real time.\n\u2022 The agent is free to choose starting and ending times for all connectors, but does not control which branch a split connector will follow; instead, the agent merely observes which branch is followed in real time.2\nIf a workflow admits a strategy for executing its tasks and connectors such that\n\u2022 its execution decisions depend only on past observations of task durations and branch directions; and\n\u2022 all delays and temporal constraints are guaranteed to be satisfied no matter how the task durations turn out and no matter which branches are taken,\nthen that workflow is said to be history-dependent controllable (Combi and Posenato 2009; 2010). The workflow in Fig. 1 is history-dependent controllable. A successful strategy must restrict the interval for B2 to be [32, 42] if the branch containing task T4 was taken, or [1, 31] if the branch containing task T3 was taken. Combi and Posenato (2010) presented an exponential-time algorithm for determining whether any workflow is history-dependent controllable.\nThe rest of this paper introduces a Conditional Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (CSTNU) that provides a formal representation for the time-points and temporal constraints underlying workflows.

Each observation time-point has a proposition associated with it. When\n2This paper restricts attention to conditional connectors. Combi and Posenato (2009) discuss additional kinds of connectors.\nthe observation time-point is executed, the truth-value of its associated proposition becomes known. In addition, each time-point has a label that restricts the scenarios in which that time-point can be executed. For example, a label, A\u00acB, on a time-point would indicate that that time-point could only be executed in scenarios where the proposition A was true and B was false.\nAlthough not included in the formal definition, the authors made the following reasonability assumptions about CSTPs:\n(A1) A CSTP should not include any constraint relating time-points whose labels are inconsistent.\n(A2) If the label on some time-point T includes a propositionQ, then the observation node, TQ, associated with Q must be executed in all cases in which T is executed, and TQ must be executed before T (i.e., TQ < T ).3\nThis section defines a Conditional Simple Temporal Network (CSTN), which is the same as a CSTP except that: \u2022 the CSTN definition explicitly incorporates the reason-\nability assumptions (A1) and (A2) (cf. conditions WD1 and WD2 in Defn. 4, below); and\n\u2022 each constraint in a CSTN has a label associated with it that subsumes the labels of the time-points it constrains (cf. conditions WD1 and WD3 in Defn. 4, below).\nPutting labels on the constraints will facilitate the propagation of constraints, as is discussed later on. Definition 2 (Label, Label Universe). Given a set P of propositional letters, a label is any (possibly empty) conjunction of (positive or negative) literals from P . For convenience, the empty label is denoted by . The label universe of P , denoted by P \u2217, is the set of all labels whose literals are drawn from P .\nFor example, if P = {A,B}, then P\u2217 = { , A,B,\u00acA,\u00acB,AB,A\u00acB,\u00acAB,\u00acA\u00acB}.\nDefinition 3 (Consistent labels, label subsumption). \u2022 Two labels, `1 and `2, are called consistent, denoted by Con(`1, `2), if and only if `1 \u2227 `2 is satisfiable. \u2022 A label `1 subsumes a label `2, denoted by Sub(`1, `2),\nif and only if |= (`1 \u21d2 `2). To facilitate comparison with the definition of a CSTP, which is not repeated here due to space limitations, the order of arguments in a CSTN is the same as in a CSTP. Definition 4 (CSTN). A Conditional Simple Temporal Network (CSTN) is a tuple, \u3008T , C, L,OT ,O, P \u3009, where: \u2022 T is a finite set of real-valued time-points; \u2022 P is a finite set of propositional letters (or propositions); \u2022 L : T \u2192 P \u2217 is a function that assigns a label to each\ntime-point in T ; \u2022 OT \u2286 T is a (finite) set of observation time-points; \u2022 O : P \u2192 OT is a bijection that associates a unique\nobservation time-point to each propositional letter; 3Simple temporal constraints do not allow for strict inequalities such as Y < X; however, in practice, a constraint such as Y \u2212X \u2264 \u2212 , for some small > 0, achieves the desired effect.\n\u2022 C is a set of labeled simple temporal constraints, each having the form, (Y \u2212X \u2264 \u03b4, `), where X,Y \u2208 T , \u03b4 is a real number, and ` \u2208 P \u2217;\n(WD1) for any labeled constraint, (Y \u2212X \u2264 \u03b4, `) \u2208 C, the label ` is satisfiable and subsumes both L(X) and L(Y );\n(WD2) for each p \u2208 P , and each T \u2208 T for which either p or \u00acp appears in T \u2019s label, \u25e6 Sub(L(T ), L(O(p)), and \u25e6 (O(p)\u2212 T \u2264 \u2212 , L(T )) \u2208 C, for some > 0; and\n(WD3) for each labeled constraint, (Y \u2212 X \u2264 \u03b4, `), and for each p \u2208 P for which either p or \u00acp appears in `, \u25e6 Sub(`, L(O(p))). The following definitions will facilitate the proofs of the\nsubsequent lemmas.\nDefinition 5 (C , LT and O\u2205). \u2022 If C is a set of simple temporal constraints, then C is the\ncorresponding set of labeled simple temporal constraints, where each constraint is labeled by the empty label, . In particular, C = {(Y \u2212X \u2264 \u03b4, ) | (Y \u2212X \u2264 \u03b4) \u2208 C} \u2022 For any set T of time-points, LT denotes the labeling\nfunction that assigns the empty label to each time-point. Thus, LT (T ) = for all T \u2208 T . When the context allows, we may write L instead of LT . \u2022 O\u2205 denotes the unique function whose domain and range\nare both empty. Thus, O\u2205 : \u2205 \u2192 \u2205. The following lemmas show that any STN or CSTP can\nbe embedded within a CSTN.\nLemma 1. Let (T , C) be any STN. Then \u3008T , C , L , \u2205,O\u2205, \u2205\u3009 is a CSTN. Proof. We need only check that the conditions WD1, WD2 and WD3 from the definition of a CSTN are satisfied. WD2 and WD3 are trivially satsified since P = \u2205. As for WD1, each constraint in C has as its label, which is satisfiable. Furthermore,L assigns the empty label to every node. Thus, the empty label on each constraint trivially subsumes the empty label on the relevant nodes.\nLemma 2 (Any CSTP is a CSTN). Let \u3008V,E, L,OV,O, P \u3009 be any CSTP, as defined by Tsamardinos et al. (2003), that satisfies the reasonability assumptions, A1 and A2.

An agent typically activates a contingent link by executing A. After doing so, the execution of C is out of the agent\u2019s control; however, C is guaranteed to execute such that the temporal difference, C \u2212 A, is between x and y. Contingent links are used to represent actions with uncertain durations; the agent initiates the action, but then merely observes its completion in real time. Definition 6 (STNU).

The strategy is dynamic in that its execution decisions can react to past observations, but not those in the future. This section defines the dynamic consistency of a CSTN in an equivalent way; however, for convenience, there are some superficial differences in notation and organization. Afterward, we provide a second characterization of the dynamic property that will be useful later on.\nDefinition 9 (Scenario/Interpretation Function). A scenario (or interpretation function) over a set P of propositional letters is a function, s : P \u2192 {true, false}, that assigns a truth value to each letter in P .6 As is standard practice in propositional logic, any interpretation function can be extended to provide the truth value for every possible formula involving the letters in P . Thus, any interpretation function, s, can provide the truth value of each label involving letters in P . For any label, `, the truth value of ` in the scenario, s, is denoted by s(`). Let IP (or simply I) denote the set of all interpretation functions (or complete execution scenarios) over P .\nDefinition 10 (Schedule). A schedule for a set of timepoints T is a mapping, \u03c8 : T \u2192 R that assigns a real number to each time-point in T . The set of all schedules for any subset of T is denoted by \u03a8T (or \u03a8 if the context allows).\nBelow, the projection of a CSTN, S, onto a scenario, s, is defined to be the STN that contains all of the time-points and constraints from S whose labels are true under s (i.e., the time-points that must be executed under s, and the constraints that must be satisfied under s).\nDefinition 11 (Scenario Projection for a CSTN). Let S = \u3008T , C, L,OT ,O, P \u3009 be any CSTN, and s any interpretation function (i.e., complete scenario) for the letters in P . The projection of S onto the scenario s\u2014denoted by scPrj (S, s)\u2014is the STN, (T +s , C+s ), where: \u2022 T +s = {T \u2208 T : s(L(T )) = true}; and \u2022 C+s = {(Y \u2212X \u2264 \u03b4) | for some `, (Y \u2212X \u2264 \u03b4, `) \u2208 C\nand s(`) = true}\n6Unlike the prior work on CSTPs, we restrict attention to complete scenarios because the subsequent definition of a history requires a scenario to entail the outcome of all past observations.\nRecall that condition WD1 from the definition of a CSTN stipulates that the label on any constraint must subsume the labels on the time-points it connects. Thus, for any constraint in C+s , the time-points it connects must belong to the set T +s . Definition 12 (Execution Strategy for a CSTN). Let S = \u3008T , C, L,OT ,O, P \u3009 be any CSTN. An execution strategy for S is a mapping, \u03c3 : I \u2192 \u03a8T , such that for each scenario, s \u2208 I, the domain of \u03c3(s) is T +s (cf. Defn. 11). If, in addition, for each scenario, s, the schedule \u03c3(s) is a solution to the scenario projection, scPrj (S, s), then \u03c3 is called viable. In any case, the execution time for the time-point X in the schedule \u03c3(s) is denoted by [\u03c3(s)]X .\nBelow, the history of a time-point, X , relative to a scenario, s, and strategy, \u03c3, is defined to be the set of observations made before the time at whichX is executed according to the schedule, \u03c3(s) (i.e., before the time [\u03c3(s)]X ).7\nDefinition 13 (Scenario history for a CSTN). Let S = \u3008T , C, L,OT ,O, P \u3009 be any CSTN, s any scenario, \u03c3 any execution strategy for S, and X any time-point in T +s (cf. Defn. 11). The history of X in the scenario s, for the strategy \u03c3\u2014denoted by scHst(X, s, \u03c3)\u2014is given by:\nscHst(X, s, \u03c3) = {(p, s(p)) | O(p) \u2208 T +s , and [\u03c3(s)]O(p) < [\u03c3(s)]X}\nNote that any scenario history determines a corresponding label whose (positive or negative) literals are in a one-to-one correspondence with the observations, (p, s(p)), in the history. Thus, we may sometimes (e.g., in the next definition) treat a scenario history as though it were a label.\nBelow, an execution strategy is called dynamic if the schedules it generates always assign the same execution time to any time-pointX in scenarios that cannot be distinguished prior to that time.8\nDefinition 14 (Dynamic Execution Strategy for a CSTN). An execution strategy, \u03c3, for a CSTN is called dynamic if for all scenarios, s1 and s2, and any time-point X:\nif Con(s1, scHst(X, s2, \u03c3)), then [\u03c3(s1)]X = [\u03c3(s2)]X .\nDefinition 15 (Dynamic Consistency for a CSTN). A CSTN is called dynamically consistent if there exists an execution strategy for it that is both viable and dynamic.\nThe following definitions and lemma provide an equivalent, alternative characterization of a dynamic execution strategy for a CSTN. First, a scenario history relative to a numerical time\u2014not a time-point variable\u2014is defined.\nDefinition 16 (Scenario History\u2217 for a CSTN). Let S = \u3008T , C, L,OT ,O, P \u3009 be any CSTN, s any scenario, \u03c3 any execution strategy for S, and t any real number. The history\u2217 of t in the scenario s, for the strategy \u03c3\u2014denoted by\n7Tsamardinos et al. (2003) define (pre)histories for arbitrary schedules, whereas here we restrict attention to schedules of the form, \u03c3(s), where \u03c3 is an execution strategy and s is a scenario.\n8Tsamardinos et al. (2003) include a disjunctive condition, Con(s1, scHst(X, s2, \u03c3)) \u2228 Con(s2, scHist(X, s1, \u03c3)). However, since s1 and s2 play symmetric roles in the two disjuncts, and since s1 and s2 are both universally quantified (cf. Defn. 14), it suffices to include just one of the disjuncts.\nscHst\u2217(t, s, \u03c3)\u2014is the set of all observations made before time t according to the schedule, \u03c3(s). In particular: scHst\u2217(t, s, \u03c3) = {(p, s(p)) | O(p) \u2208 T +s and [\u03c3(s)]O(p) < t}\nNote that for all time-pointsX , scenarios s, and strategies \u03c3, scHst(X, s, \u03c3) = scHst\u2217([\u03c3(s)]X , s, \u03c3). Definition 17 (Dynamic\u2217 Execution Strategy for a CSTN).

Now s2 must be consistent with scHst\u2217(t1, s2, \u03c3), since the observations contained in that history are a subset of the observations in s2. Thus, s2 is consistent with scHst\u2217(t1, s1, \u03c3), which equals scHst(X, s1, \u03c3). Thus, since \u03c3 is dynamic, we must have that [\u03c3(s1)]X = [\u03c3(s2)]X . Thus, \u03c3 is dynamic\u2217. (\u21d0) Suppose \u03c3 is a dynamic\u2217 execution strategy for some CSTN.

Then, t \u2264 min{[\u03c3(s1)]X , [\u03c3(s2)]X}; and there must be some timepoint Y that is executed at time t in one scenario, and at some later time in the other scenario. By construction, t \u2264 [\u03c3(s2)]X . Thus, scHst\u2217(t, s2, \u03c3) \u2286 scHst\u2217([\u03c3(s2)]X , s2, \u03c3) = scHst(X, s2, \u03c3). Thus, since Con(s1, scHst(X, s2, \u03c3)), it follows that Con(s1, scHst\n\u2217(t, s2, \u03c3)). And since s1 is a complete scenario, the observations in scHst\u2217(t, s2, \u03c3) must be a subset of the \u201cobservations\u201d in s1. And since, by construction, the schedules, \u03c3(s1) and \u03c3(s2), are identical prior to time t, it follows that the observations in the two histories, scHst\u2217(t, s1, \u03c3) and scHst\u2217(t, s2, \u03c3), involve the same sets of observation time-points with identical outcomes (i.e., truth values). Thus, scHst\u2217(t, s1, \u03c3) = scHst\n\u2217(t, s2, \u03c3), whence the property of \u03c3 being dynamic\u2217 implies that [\u03c3(s1)]Y = [\u03c3(s2)]Y , contradicting the choice of Y .

Definition 29 (Dynamic Controllability for a CSTNU). A CSTNU, S, is dynamically controllable if there exists an execution strategy for S that is both viable and dynamic\u2217.\nThe following lemmas show that the above definition properly generalizes the dynamic consistency of a CSTN and the dynamic controllability of an STNU. Lemma 6. Let S = \u3008T , C, L,OT ,O, P \u3009 be any CSTN. Then S is dynamically consistent if and only if the CSTNU, Su = \u3008T , C, L,OT ,O, P, \u2205\u3009, is dynamically controllable. Proof. Let S = \u3008T , C, L,OT ,O, P \u3009 be any dynamically consistent CSTN. Then S has an execution strategy, \u03c3 : I \u2192 \u03a8T , that is both viable and dynamic. By Lemma 5, \u03c3 is also dynamic\u2217. In addition, since S is a CSTN, Lemma 4 ensures that Su = \u3008T , C, L,OT ,O, P, \u2205\u3009 is a CSTNU. We must show that Su has an execution strategy, \u03c3u : (I\u00d7\u2126)\u2192 \u03a8T , that is both viable and dynamic\u2217. Note that since Su has no contingent links, \u2126 contains exactly one situation\u2014the null situation\u2014which we shall denote by \u03c9\u2205.\nDefine \u03c3u as follows. For any drama, (s, \u03c9\u2205), let \u03c3u(s, \u03c9\u2205) = \u03c3(s). Note that \u03c3u is an execution strategy for Su, since the domain of \u03c3(s) is guaranteed to be T +s .\nSince \u03c3 is viable, for any scenario s, the schedule \u03c3(s) is a solution to the scenario projection, scPrj (S, s). However, for any s, the schedules, \u03c3(s) and \u03c3(s, \u03c9\u2205) are defined to be the same. Furthermore, since Su has no contingent links, it follows that for any s, the drama projection, drPrj (Su, s, \u03c9\u2205), is the same STN as scPrj (S, s) (cf. Defns. 11 and 25). Thus, for any s, \u03c3(s, \u03c9\u2205) is necessarily a solution to drPrj (Su, s, \u03c9\u2205), whence \u03c3u is viable.\nTo show that \u03c3u is dynamic\u2217, suppose (s1, \u03c9\u2205) and (s2, \u03c9\u2205) are any dramas in I \u00d7 \u2126, X is a noncontingent time-point in T +s1 \u2229 T + s2 , t = [\u03c3u(s1, \u03c9\u2205)]X , and drHst\u2217(t, s1, \u03c9\u2205, \u03c3u) = drHst \u2217(t, s2, \u03c9\u2205, \u03c3u). Note that t = [\u03c3u(s1, \u03c9\u2205)]X = [\u03c3(s1)]X . Furthermore, since there are no contingent links, drHst\u2217(t, s1, \u03c9\u2205, \u03c3u) = drHst\u2217(t, s2, \u03c9\u2205, \u03c3u) if and only if scHst\n\u2217(t, s1, \u03c3) = scHst\u2217(t, s2, \u03c3) (cf. Defns. 16 and 27). But then \u03c3 being dynamic\u2217 ensures that [\u03c3(s1)]X = [\u03c3(s2)]X (cf. Defn. 17), and hence [\u03c3u(s1, \u03c9\u2205)]X = [\u03c3u(s2, \u03c9\u2205)]X . Lemma 7. Let S = (T , C,L) be any STNU. Then S is dynamically controllable if and only if the CSTNU, \u3008T , C , L , \u2205,O\u2205, \u2205,L\u3009, is dynamically controllable. Proof. The proof is omitted for space reasons. It has the same general structure as the proof of Lemma 6."}, {"heading": "Toward a DC-Checking Algorithm for CSTNUs", "text": "This section addresses the problem of finding an algorithm for determining the dynamic controllability of arbitrary CSTNUs. Given that CSTNUs combine the features of CSTPs and STNUs, one approach would be to combine existing algorithms for determining the dynamic consistency of CSTPs and the dynamic controllability of STNUs. However, those algorithms employ very different techniques. For example, in the CSTP algorithm, Tsamardinos et al. (2003) first derive a related Disjunctive Temporal Problem (DTP), and then solve it using a dedicated DTP solver that is optimized by a variety of constraint-satisfaction heuristics. In contrast, the fastest algorithm for determining whether arbitrary STNUs are dynamically controllable is the O(N4)time algorithm developed by Morris (2006), which is a constraint-propagation algorithm that focuses on the reducing away of lower-case edges in an STNU graph.\nAnother problem is that the CSTP algorithm uses exponential space and time. Conrad and colleagues (Conrad 2010; Conrad and Williams 2011) developed the Drake system for propagating labeled constraints in temporal networks with choice.9 The aim was to reduce the space required to generate dispatchable plans, while accepting slight increases in the time requirements.

One such rule is presented below.\nConsider the CSTNU fragment in Fig. 4, where 0 \u2264 w, v \u2264 w, \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 are labels that do not share any propositional letters, and p is a propositional letter that does not appear in \u03b1, \u03b2 or \u03b3.

Thus, when p? executes, the value of p becomes known. The arrow from p? to X represents the labeled constraint, (X \u2212 p? \u2264 \u2212w, \u03b1\u03b2). Thus, in scenarios where \u03b1\u03b2 is true, X + w \u2264 p? must hold. Thus, in those scenarios, X must be executed before p is observed. The arrow from X to Y represents the constraint, (Y \u2212X \u2264 v, \u03b2\u03b3p). Thus, in scenarios where \u03b2\u03b3p is true, Y \u2264 X + v must hold\u2014in which case, Y must execute before the value of p is known. Lemma 8 (Label Modification Rule). If \u03c3 is a dynamic execution strategy that satisfies the labeled constraints in Fig. 4 in all scenarios where their labels are true, then \u03c3 must also satisfy the labeled constraint, (Y \u2212 X \u2264 v, \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3), in all scenarios where \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 is true. Moreover, the original labeled constraint, (Y \u2212 X \u2264 v, \u03b2\u03b3p), can be replaced by the pair of labeled constraints, (Y \u2212X \u2264 v, \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) and (Y \u2212X \u2264 v, (\u00ac\u03b1)\u03b2\u03b3p). Proof. Let \u03c3 be as in the statement of the lemma. However, suppose that there is some drama, (s, \u03c9), such that: (1) the label \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 is true in scenario s; but (2) the schedule, \u03c3(s, \u03c9), does not satisfy the constraint, (Y \u2212 X \u2264 v). Let s2 be the same scenario as s, except that the value of p is flipped. Now, by construction, in one of the scenarios, s or s2, the label, \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3p, is true. Let s\u0302 be that scenario, and \u03c3(s\u0302, \u03c9) the corresponding schedule. By construction, that schedule satisfies both of the labeled constraints from Fig. 4, since their labels are true in s\u0302. Thus,\n[\u03c3(s\u0302, \u03c9)]Y \u2264 [\u03c3(s\u0302, \u03c9)]X + v , since Y \u2212X \u2264 v \u2264 [\u03c3(s\u0302, \u03c9)]X + w, since v \u2264 w \u2264 p? , since X \u2212 p? \u2264 \u2212w\nLet s\u0303 be the scenario that is the same as s\u0302, except that the value of p is flipped. Let t be the first time at which the schedules, \u03c3(s\u0302, \u03c9) and \u03c3(s\u0303, \u03c9), differ. Thus, there must be some time-point T that is executed in one of the schedules at time t, and in the other at some time later than t. But in that case, the corresponding histories at time t must be different. But the only possible difference must involve the value of the proposition p, since all other propositions and contingent durations are identical in the dramas, (s\u0302, \u03c9) and (s\u0303, \u03c9). Thus, p? must be executed before time t. Since t is the time of first difference in the schedules, it follows that p? is executed at the same time in each of these schedules. Furthermore, since X and Y are both executed before p? in \u03c3(s\u0302, \u03c9), and hence before the time of first difference, it follows that X and Y are also executed at those same times in \u03c3(s\u0303, \u03c9). Thus, regardless of the value of p, the constraint Y \u2212X \u2264 v is satisfied, contradicting the choice of (s, \u03c9).\nFor the second part, consider the following constraints: \u2022 C1: (Y \u2212X \u2264 v, \u03b2\u03b3p) \u2022 C2: (Y \u2212X \u2264 v, \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) \u2022 C1.1: (Y \u2212X \u2264 v, \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3p) \u2022 C1.2: (Y \u2212X \u2264 v, (\u00ac\u03b1)\u03b2\u03b3p)\nC1 is the constraint from X to Y shown in Fig. 4. C2 is the constraint derived in the first part of this proof. Now, C1 is equivalent to the pair of constraints, C1.1 and C1.2, since \u03b2\u03b3p \u2261 (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3p) \u2228 ((\u00ac\u03b1)\u03b2\u03b3p). Thus, the constraint set {C1, C2} is equivalent to the constraint set {C1.1, C1.2, C2}. However, since the label on C2 is subsumed by the label on C1.1, the constraint C2 dominates the constraint C1.1. Thus, the constraint set {C1, C2} is equivalent to {C1.2, C2}.\nThis and other label-modification rules are expected to play an important role in the dynamic controllabilitychecking algorithm that is a major goal of this work."}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "This paper presented a temporal network, called a CSTNU, that generalizes CSTPs and STNUs from the literature.

In future work, we aim to show that any workflow is history-dependent controllable if and only if its underlying CSTNU is dynamically controllable."}], "references": [{"title": "Temporal reasoning in workflow systems", "author": ["C.

To meet this need, this paper defines a Conditional Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (CSTNU) that combines the simple temporal constraints from a Simple Temporal Network (STN) with the conditional nodes from a Conditional Simple Temporal Problem (CSTP) and the contingent links from a Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU). A notion of dynamic controllability for a CSTNU is defined that generalizes the dynamic consistency of a CTP and the dynamic controllability of an STNU. The paper also presents some sound constraint-propagation rules for dynamic controllability that are expected to form the backbone of a dynamiccontrollability-checking algorithm for CSTNUs. Introduction and Motivation Workflow systems have been used to model business, manufacturing and medical-treatment processes. However, as Bettini et al. (2002) observed: \u201cIt would greatly enhance the capabilities of current workflow systems if quantitative temporal constraints on the duration of activities and their synchronization requirements can be specified and reasoned about.\u201d Toward that end, Combi et al. (2007; 2009; 2010) presented a new workflow model that accommodates the following key features: tasks with uncertain/uncontrollable durations; temporal constraints among tasks; and branching paths, where the branch taken is not known in advance. Fig. 1 shows a sample workflow from the health-care domain, similar to one presented by Combi and Posenato (2009). In this workflow, all times are in minutes, and: \u2022 tasks are represented by rounded boxes; \u2022 branching points are represented by nine-sided boxes called split or join connectors1; \u2022 tasks and connectors have duration attributes, [x, y]; \u2217Funded in part by the Phoebe H.
