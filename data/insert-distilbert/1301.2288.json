In this paper we explore the prob\u00ad lem of inference in CLGs, and provide complexity re\u00ad sults for an important class of CLGs, which includes Switching Kalman Filters. In particular, we prove that even if the CLG is restricted to an extremely simple structure of a polytree, the inference task is NP-hard. Furthermore, we show that, unless P=NP, even ap\u00ad proximate inference on these simple networks is in\u00ad tractable. Given the often prohibitive computational cost of even approximate inference, we must take advantage of spe\u00ad cial domain properties which may enable efficient in\u00ad ference. We concentrate on the fault diagnosis domain, and explore several approximate inference algorithms. These algorithms try to find a small subset of Gaus\u00ad sians which are a good approximation to the full mix\u00ad ture distribution. We consider two Monte Carlo ap\u00ad proaches and a novel approach that enumerates mix\u00ad ture components in order of prior probability.
