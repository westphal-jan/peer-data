There\u00ad fore, it is difficult to ascertain independence without examining discretized data at sev\u00ad eral carefully selected resolutions. In our paper, we accomplish this using the exact computation of the posterior probability of independence, calculated analytically given a resolution. At each examined resolution and boundary placement, we assume a multi\u00ad nomial distribution with Dirichlet priors for the discretized table parameters, and com\u00ad pute the posterior using Bayesian integra\u00ad tion. Across resolutions, we use a search pro\u00ad cedure to approximate the Bayesian integral of probability over an exponential number of possible boundary placements. Our method generalizes to an arbitrary number variables in a straightforward manner.
