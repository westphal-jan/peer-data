Each decision criterion is justified by a set of axioms capturing part of the decision behaviour of the DM. Among the most classical studies in this direc tion are the seminal works of Von Neumann and Mor genstern (1947) and Savage (1954). Such approaches rely on the use of a quantitative criterion for the com parison of alternatives whose justification requires sev eral strong assumptions. For instance, the axiom sys tem usually implies that the subjective value attached to each consequence can be quantified, as well as the likelihood of the possible events. However, in practi cal applications, the elicitation of the information re quired by a quantitative model cannot always be as sessed. This is why some alternative models have been proposed in AI, relying on a more ordinal representa tion of preferences and uncertainty (e.g the qualitative\nutility proposed by Dubois and Prade (1995)).\nEven if qualitative utility mainly relies on the use of ordinal information (preference order on consequences, relative likelihood of events) it shares a common fea ture with the expected utility criterion: the commen surability of the preference scale and the uncertainty scale used in the model. Recent works in AI propose to escape this assumption in two different ways. The first one is to compare two acts on the basis of their consequences in the most plausible states of the world (Boutilier (1994); Tan and Pearl (1994); Brafman and Tennenholtz (1996), (1997)). The other way is to rely on a decision rule that compares the plausibility of the sets of states in which one act has a better consequence than the other (see Dubois et a!. ( 1997)). This rule has been originally proposed in a possibilitic framework, but could be easily extended to other uncertainty re lations, thus defining other preference models. The aim of the present paper is to provide an unified ax iomatic framework for these kind of rules and to study their ability to describe the DM preferences.\nIn the next section, we present various quantitative and qualitative models for decision making under un certainty and discuss the necessity of making prefer ence and uncertainty commensurate. In Section 3, an axiomatic framework for purely qualitative preference models is introduced and the structure of qualitative decision rules is characterized. In Section 4 we char acterize the qualitative decision rules compatible with the transitivity of the strict preference. Finally, in Sec tion 5, we discuss some variations of our framework and propose a new family of qualitative decision rules compatible with the transitivity requirement. Notice that in order to save space, all the proofs are omitted.\n2 EXAMPLES AND MOTIVATIONS\nDecision Making under uncertainty implies a choice among a set of potential acts (decisions) whose conse quences are not perfectly known. From a formal point\nQualitative Models for Decision Under Uncertainty 189\nof view, such a decision problem is characterized by a set S of states representing the possible situations (or decision contexts), a set X of possible consequences, and a set of acts viewed as elements of X 5 (i.e. an act is a mapping f : S \ufffd X where f(s) represents the consequence of act f for any state s E S). In this paper, S and X are supposed to be finite1 . Thus, if X= {xJ, ... ,xm} and S = {s1, ... ,sn}, an act f E X5 is completely characterized by the vector of consequences (f(si), ... , f(sn))\nDenoting \ufffd the DM's preference relation over acts, we define the indifference relation \ufffd, and a strict prefer ence relation >- by:\nf \ufffd g \u00a2::;. f \ufffd g and g \ufffd f f >- g \u00a2::;. f \ufffd g and not(g \ufffd f)\nThe role of decision analysis is to construct a model of DM's preferences \ufffd, including his subjectivity in the evaluation of possible events and consequences of alternatives, so as to be able to use this model to sup port the decision making process. Several preference models have been proposed in this direction, that are all based on a decision rule of the following form:\nf \ufffd g \u00a2::;. x( f(s!), ... , f(sn), g(sJ), ... , g(sn)) (I)\nwhere X is a comparison function defined from X2n to {0, 1} (0 for 'false' and 1 for 'true'). Now we distin guish two types of models corresponding to two differ ent instances of equation (1).\n2. 1 PREFERENCE MODELS BASED ON A VALUE FUNCTION\nThese models are characterized by the definition of a value function v : X5 \ufffd Y where Y is an or dered set and v(f) measures the subjective attrac tiveness of f for the DM. In such models, v(f) = 1/J(f(si), . . . , f(sn)) where 1/J is an aggregation function defined from xn to Y. These models are characterized by the following instance of equation ( 1)\nwhere 'P is a comparison function defined from Y2 to {0, 1}. Let us recall some well known examples:\n2. 1.1 The Expected Utility\nThis model is based on a utility function u : X >-+ [0, 1] measuring the subjective attractiveness of any consequence x E X and a probability dis tribution p on S defined by the given of the vec tor (p(s1), . . \u2022 ,p(sn)). In this probabilistic model\n1This differs from Savage's original framework for deci sion making under uncertainty\n\u00a2(z1, ... , Zn) = 2::\ufffd=! p(si)u(zi). This defines a cri terion v(f) for any f E X5 by:\nv(f) = LP(s)u(f(s)) (2) sES\n2. 1. 2 The Qualitative Utilities\nThe pessimistic qualitative utility (see e.g. Dubois and Prade (1995); Dubois et al. (1998)) is based on a util ity function u : X >-+ [0, 1] measuring the attractive ness of a consequence x E X and a possibility distribution 1r on S defined by the vector (1r(s1), ... , 7r(sn)). In this model \u00a2(z1, . . . , zn) = mini=I ... .. n max{l - 1r(si)), u(z;)}. This defines the pessimistic criterion v-(f) for any f E X5 by:\nv-(f) = min max{1- 1r(s),u(f(s))} (3) sES This criterion is actually a weighted extension of the Wald criterion and, to some extent, it is \" more quali tative\" than the standard expected utility. The optimistic qualitative utility model (see e.g.; Dubois and Prade (1995); Dubois, et a! (1998)) is a variation of the previous model, and as such, it re quires the same utility function and the same pos sibility distribution. This model is characterized by \u00a2(z1, ... ,zn) = maxi=!, ... ,n min{7r(s;) , u(z;)} . This defines the optimistic qualitative criterion v+ (f):\n= max min{1r(s), u(f(s))} sES\n2.2 THE COMMENSURABILITY HYPOTHESIS\n(4)\nLet us underline some implicit assumptions in decision models based on value functions, namely the commen surability between preference and uncertainty, and, for the expected utility model, the cardinality of utilities. Suppose that the DM's preference over X are known and can be represented by the weak-order \ufffdP (\ufffdP is precisely the order encoded by the utility function). Simllarily, suppose that the subjective likelihood of each event for the DM is known and is described by a binary uncertainty relation \ufffdu on 25 (e.g. represented by the probability /possibility /necessity measure).\nExample 1 Let us consider a decision problem with two states { s1, s2} which are seen as equally plausible by the decision maker (i.e. s1 \ufffdu s2 and s2 \ufffdu s1) and a set of consequences X= {x!,X2,xa,x4} such that x1 >- p x2 >- p x3 >- p X4. Let us consider two different utility functions u1 and u2 that could be used to encode the preference order >-p:\nXJ X2 X3 X4\nUJ 0.9 0.6 0.4 0.3 u2 0. 7 0.6 0.4 0.1\n190 Fargier and Pemy\nIn this paper, we denote !IAd2A2, ... , An-d nAn the act whose result is fi(s) if s E At, 'lfi = 1, ... , n, for any partition A1, ... , An-1, An of the set of states. Consider the acts f = x1 { 81 }x4 { s2} and g = x2 {8!}x3 {82}. Suppose now that we want to use the expected utility model to compare f and g. The prob ability distribution on S must be p(8I) = p(82) = 0.5. Using function u1 in equation {2) we get the expected values v1 (f) = 0.6, v1 (g) = 0.5. Performing the same operations with u2 yields to v2(!) = 0.4, v2(g) = 0.5. Therefore we get f >-- g with u1 and g >-- f with u2 .\nHence, when using expected utility, the preference over acts depends on the particular utility function chosen to encode the preference order >--p. This shows that this model exploits an extra information not contained in relations '(,p and ';::::,u. This is due to the cardinal interpretation of utility grades and to their interlace ment with the probabilities.\nIn this example, whenever we use a possibility distribu tion 1r to describe our knowledge about the plausibility of events, we have to set: 1r(s1) = 1r(82) = 1. Then, the pessimistic qualitative utility gives: v] (f) = 0.3 and the v] (g) = 0.4 from u1 and therefore g >-- f , and we get exactly the same preference with function u2 since v;;(f) = 0.1 and the v;;(g) = 0.4. Thus, on this example where the initial information (represented by relations '(,p and ';::::,u) is purely ordinal, using qualita tive utility seems more natural than expected utility. From such an example, we could infer that this ordinal model is purely qualitative. However, things are less elementary, as shown in the following example.\nExample 2 Suppose now that s1 >--u 82 in example 1 and consider the following utility functions:\nX! X2 X3 X4 UI 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 u2 o.g 0.8 0.7 0.6\nWe want now to compare the acts f and g on the ba sis of the pessimistic qualitative utility model. Let us choose an arbitrary possibility distribution on S to rep resent the likelihood weak-order on ';::::,u, e.g 1r(81) = 1 and 1r(82) = 0.5. Hence, using function u1 in equa tion (3) we get the expected values v] (f) \"' 0.4, vj(g) = 0.3. Performing the same operations with function u2 yields to v;;(f) == 0.6, v;;(g) \"'0.7. There fore we get f >-- g with v] and g >-- f with v;;.\nThis example shows that models based on qualita tive utility also exploit an extra information not con tained in relations '(,p and ';::::,u, namely their interlace ment. Indeed, in such models, utility and possibility are commensurate and represented on a common or dinal scale P U . On this scale, the use of function u1\nyields to the following order: 8I >-- PU 82 >--PU XI >-- PU x2 >--PU X3 >--PU X4 whereas function u2 yields to: 81 ?-PU XI ?-PU X2 ?-PU X3 )-- PU X4 ?-PU 82. This explains the difference of result. Constructing relation >-- PU from >--u and >--p requires additional information which must be elicited by questioning the DM. In the following Section, we introduce simple models avoiding the definition of relation ';::Pu.\n2.3 PREFERENCE MODELS BASED ON PAIRWISE COMPARISONS\nWe consider here models characterized by the following general instance of equation ( 1).\nf ';::::, g <==> <p1[1/J[<p(/(8I ), g(si)), ... , <p(f(8n), g(sn))], 1/![<p(g(81), /(8I) ), ... , <p(g(8n), f(8n))]]\nwhere <p and <p1 are comparison functions and 1/! is an aggregation function. When the preferences over X are represented by the weak-order '(,p we can choose:\nNow, if we assume that the subjective likelihood of each event for the DM are described by a binary un certainty relation ';::::,u on 25, then for any pair of events A, B seen as elements of 25 and characterized by vec tors (a I , ... , an) and (b1, ... , bn) respectively, we can define function 1/J so as to satisfy the condition:\nThis yields to the following general decision rule:\nI ';::::, g <==> [! '(,p g] ';::::,u [g '(,p / ] (5)\nwhere[! '(,p g] = {8 E S,/ (8) '(,p g(8)}. This general Lifting Rule, proposed by Dubois and a!. (1997), can be seen as the counterpart of majority rules in social choice theory (see e.g Bordes (1983)).\nThe Probabilistic Lifting rule , can be represented by a function 1/J defined by:\n\u00a2(a1, ... ,an)= L p(8j) {j:a;=l}\nwhere p is a probability distribution on S.\nThe Necessity Lifting rule, corresponds to : 1/J(ai, .. . , an)= min (1- 1r(sj)) {J:a,=O}\nwhere 1r is a possibility distribution on S. Symmetri cally, we can propose a new Possibilistic Lifting Rule, represented by a function 1/! defined by:\n1/!(ai, ... ,an)= max 7r(8j) {J:a;=l}\nQualitative Models for Decision Under Uncertainty 191\nPossibilistic and necessity lifting rules yield to a rela tion >;.:, whose asymmetric part is transitive but that this is not the case for the probabilistic lifting. These three rules yield to a complete relation >;.:,, however we can consider more general lifting rules yielding to incomplete preference structures. For example, one can consider a family of possibilitity distributions, and state that f is preferred to g iff, for each possibility distribution in the family, the possibilit of [! >;.:,p g] is greater than the possibility of [g >;.:,p f ].\nFinally, notice that the preference inversions observed in example 1 and 2 cannot occur when using lifting rules because, by definition, the preference over acts only depends on relations >;.:,u and >;.:,p. In this respect, preference models based on a lifting rule can be seen as purely qualitative models.\n3 A QUALITATIVE VERSION OF SAVAGE's FRAMEWORK\nThis Section aims at providing an axiomatic frame work for qualitative preference models and to derive representation theorems for purely qualitative prefer ences. Following Savage we start from a user-driven preference relation over acts, and define axioms that this preference relation should satisfy to be a quali tative and \"rational\" model. Under such axioms, it is possible to construct a preference relation >;.:,p on the consequences, a likelihood relation >;.:,\u00a3 on events, and a decision rule based on these two relations that perfectly describes the DMs preferences. Let us first recall a part of the axioms proposed by Savage (1954) to characterize the expected utility model (2).\n3. 1 SAVAGE's AXIOMS\nAxiom Sl. (X5, >;.:,) is a weakly ordered space (>;.:, is complete, reflexive, transitive)\nSuch an axiom in Savage's work is justified by the goal assigned to the theory. If acts are ranked according to expected utility then the preference over acts will be transitive, reflexive, and complete. In this paper, we do not want to require such a property a priori: the DM Preferences could be rational without being complete nor transitive (see Section 4).\nNow, let A \ufffd S be an event, f and g two acts, and denote by fAg the act such that:\nfA ( ) _ { f(s) i f s E A g s - g(s) i f sf. A.\nfAg is short for fAgA where A is the complement of A. Savage has proposed the sure-thing principle axiom, that requires that the preference between two acts fAh\nand gAh does not depend on the choice of h:\nAxiom S2 (Sure-thing principle). VA \ufffd S, V J, g, h, h' E X 5, (/Ah >;.:, gAh '\u00a2:=} fAh' >;.:, gAh')\nDefinition 1 (Conditional Preference) f is said to be weakly preferred to g, conditioned on A iff if Vh E X5,fAh >;.:, gAh. This is denoted by (J >;.:, g)A.\nDefinition 2 (Null events) An event A is said to be null if and only if: V J, g, h E X5 : f Ah \ufffd gAh.\nAny event A \ufffd S unable to make a discrimination for at least one pair of acts is considered as null (e.g irrelevant for the DM). Note that this definition of null events is also consistent when >;.:, is not complete.\nAmong acts in X 5 there are constant acts such that: :Jx EX : Vs E S, f(s) == x. Such an act will be denoted f x. It seems reasonable to identify the set of constant acts { f x, x E X} and X. The D M preference relation >;.:,p on X can be induced from (X5,>;.:,) as follows:\nVx, y E X, (x >;.:,p y '\u00a2:=} fx >;.:, jy) (6)\nAnother hypothesis is that the preference order on con sequences is unique and does not depend on the events considered. This is the third Savage postulate:\nAxiom S3. VA \ufffd S,A not null, Ux >;.:, jy)A '\u00a2:=} X >;.:,p y.\nThe preference on acts also induces a likelihood rela tion among events: it is sufficient to consider the set of binary acts, of the form fxAfy, which thanks to (S3) can be denoted xAy , where x >-p y. Clearly for fixed x >-p y, the set of acts { x, y} 5 is isomorphic to the set of events 25. Since the restrictions of (X5, >;.:,) to { x, y} 5 may be inconsistent with the restriction to { x', y'} 5 for other choices of consequences x', y' such that x' >-p y', Savage has introduced a new postulate:\nAxiom S4. VA,B \ufffd S, Vx,y, x', y' EX: x ?-p y and x' >-p y', xAy >;.:, xBy '\u00a2:=} x' Ay' >;.:, x' By'. Under S4, the choice of x,y EX with x >-P y is not important when defining the ordering between events in terms of binary acts. Hence, the following likelihood relation on events can be derived from >;.:,:\nA >;.:,L B {o} (:Jx, y E X : x >-p y and xAy >;.:, xBy) (7)\nLastly, Savage has assumed that the weakly ordered set (X, >;.:,P) is not trivial:\nAxiom S5. X contains at least two elements x, y such that fx >- fy (or x >-p y). Under S1-S5, the likelihood relation>;.:,\u00a3 on events is a comparative probability ordering (be S finite or not).\n192 Fargier and Pemy\nFinally, Savage introduces last postulates that enable him to derive the existence (and uniqueness) of a nu merical probability measure on 5 that can represent the likelihood relation;:;\u00a3. However, these axioms are omitted in the present paper because they are irrele vant for a finite set of states and for qualitative models."}, {"heading": "3. 2 THE QUALITATIVE INDEPENDENCE", "text": "We propose now a new axiom aiming at specifying the qualitative nature of a preference model. This ax iom is an independence axiom that can be seen as the counterpart of an independence condition used in so cial choice theory (see Sen (1986)), completed with a neutrality condition making preferences independent of the labels of the acts considered. We call this ax iom Qualitative Independence:\nAxiom QI. Vh, g, h',g' E X5, [(h,g) = (h', g')] ===> (h;:; g {=} h';:; g'), where (h, g) = (h',g') stands for [Vs E 5, ( fh(s) ;:; f9(s) {=} !h\u2022(s) ;:; f9\u2022(s)) and (fg(s) ;:; !h(s) {=} fg\u2022(s) ;:; fh'(sj)].\nNote that, under 53, QI can be soundly rewritten as:\nAxiom QI'. [\\'s E 5, (h(s) ;:;P g(s) {=} h'(s) ;:;P g'(s)) and (g(s) ;:;P h(s) {=} g'(s) ;:;P h'(s))] ===> (h ;:; g {=} h' ;:; g')\nThis new version of QI expresses that only the relative positions of the consequences of the two acts are im portant, but not the consequences themselves, nor the positions of the two acts relatively to other acts (i.e. the preference relation is not context dependent). As a consequence, Q I holds for preferences derived using the qualitative decision rules introduced in 2.3:\nProposition 1 The general lifting rule (5) (whose definition supposes 52, 53 and 84) satisfies QI.\nActually, when 53 is assumed, QI can be understood as a strong version of 52 and also of 54, as soon as ;:; is supposed to be reflexive. Indeed we have:\nProposition 2 (83 + QI + ;:; reflexive) ===> 82\nProposition 3 (53 + Ql + ;:; reflexive) ===> 54\nSince 52 and 54 hold, assuming 53 and 55 makes it possible to briefly state the following properties of the projection of;:; on 5, i.e. ;:;L as defined in (7):\nProposition 4 (53 + 85 + QI + ;:; reflexive) ===>\ni) 5 >-\u00a30, ii) \\IA\ufffd5,A;:;d iii) \\1 A \ufffd 5, 0 ;:;L A {=} A is null iv) B is null and A\ufffd B, then A is null v) ;:;L is additive\nProposition 5 If;:; is complete on constant acts, re flexive, satisfies 53 and QI then there exists a prefer ence relation ;:;P on X defined by (6)and a likelihood relation ;:;L on 5 defined by (7) such that, for any f,g E X5, f;:; g {=} [ f ;:;P g] t\u00a3 [g ;:;P f]\nThis provides a sufficient condition for DM prefer ences to be representable by a lifting rule. Then, using proposition 1 we get:\nCorollary 1 If the DM preference ;:; is complete on constant acts, reflexive on X5 and satisfies 53, QI holds if and only if ;:; is a lifting rule.\nThis result provides a useful characterization of the lifting rule that can be used to justify this model in a practical situation. If QI is accepted as a norm for qualitative models, then the only available decision rules are lifting rules. This result holds even if;:; is not supposed to be complete, and thus concerns a wider class of lifting rules than those given in paragraph 2.3 and in Dubois et a!. (1997). Under Ql, we get nice unanimity properties: whenever f is as least as good g for all possible states, f must be preferred to g:\nProposition 6 If;:; satisfies 53, 55 and QI then 'lf,g E X5, ('is E 5,j(s) 'rp g(s)) ===> f >- g Vf,g E X5,(Vs E 5,f(s) ;:;P g(s)) ===> f ;:; g\nMoreover, if ;:; is complete then we get: 'ij,g E X5, ((('is E 5, f(s) ;:;P g(s)) and (3s E S,s not null and f (s) 'rp g(s))) ===> f >-g)\n4 THE TRA NSITIVITY OF STRICT PREFERENCE\nThe transitivity of preference resulting from a qualita tive decision rule is not obvious. This can be simply observed using the following example:\nExample 3 Suppose S = { s1, s2, s3} with probabil ities p(si) = p(s2) = p(s3) = 1/3. Consider 3 consequences x, y, z E X such that x >-p y >-p z. Using the probabilistic lifting to compare the acts f = x{s1}y{s2}z{s3},g = y {s1}z{s2}x{s3} and h = z{st}x{s2}y{s3} we get [f ;: g] = {s1,s2}, [g ;: h] = {s1,s3} and [h ;:; f] = {s2,s3}) and there fore f >- g, g >- h and h >- f, i.e. an intransitive cycle. On the contrary if probabilities of states are p'(s1) = 0.6, p'(s2) = 0.3 and p'(s3) = 0.1 we get f >- g, g >- h and f >- h, a complete order.\nThis example is actually derived from a Condorcet ef fect as those observed in Social choice (see e.g Sen, 1986)). Let us briefly clarify the relationships with ordinal aggregation, defining for each state s E S a preference relation ;:;s by:\nVf,g,EX5, J';::,.g {=} f(s)(,pg(s) (8)\nIn this context, QI is a condition requiring that prefer ence f (, g only depends on partial preferences f '::,s g and g '::,sf, s E S, and not on the consequences f(s) and g(s), s E S themselves. Therefore, under QI, linking relation (, to the profile ('(,81 , \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , (, ,\") can be seen as an ordinal aggregation problem, comparable to those studied in Social Choice Theory.\nFrom a descriptive point of view, example 3 shows the ability of qualitative decision rules to explain some cyclic preference structures and this is a really original point when compared to more classical models based on value functions. However, from a prescriptive point of view, the possibility of getting cyclic preferences is an important source of difficulty. For this reason, we investigate in this Section the possibility for qualita tive models to fulfill some minimal transitivity require ments. To this end, we must introduce new definitions concerning the decisiveness of events.\n4.1 DECISIVE EVENTS\nIn example 3, considering the probability distribution p', it is easy to show that f >-p g holds as soon as f(sJ) >-p g(sJ) and thus, s2 and s3 are negligible with respect to s1. { s1} is said to be a decisive state:\nDefinition 3 For any subsetS' <;; 8, an event A <;; 8' is said to be decisive in S' iff: V f, g E X 5, [[ (V s E 8\\ S',f(s) \ufffdP g(s)) and (Vs E A,f(s) ?-p g(s))] ==? f >-g ]. A decisive event in S is called a decisive event. A decisive singleton is called a decisive state.\nIn example 3, the transitivity is obtained using a very special structure: { s1} is a decisive state, { s2} is a de cisive state in { s2, s3} and this yields to the following hierarchy of decisive events {s!} >-L {s2,s3} >-L {s2} >-L { s3} which corresponds to a lexicographic prefer ence structure (see Fishburn, 1975). A weakening of decisiveness for states is defined by:\nDefinition 4 For any subsetS' <;; 8, the state s' E 8' is said to be a vetoer in 8' iff: Vf,g E X5, [[(Vs E\nS\\8',f(s) \ufffdP g(s)) and f(s') ?-p g(s')] ==? not(g > f)]]. A vetoer in 8 is simply called a vetoer.\nDefinition 5 For any subsetS' <;; S, an event A <;; 8' is said to be predominant in 8' iff it is decisive in 8' and contains only vetoer-states in 8'. A predominant event in S is simply called a predominant event.\n4.2 MODELS COMPATIBLE WITH QUASI-TRANSITIVE PREFERENCES\nWe consider here a very general framework where pref erences are not supposed to be transitive nor complete.\nQualitative Models for Decision Under Uncertainty 193\nWe only assume the quasi-transitivity of (,, e.g. the transitivity of its asymmetric part >-. This weak re quirement allows a wide class of preference models to be concerned, including those with an intransitive in difference (semi-orders, interval orders, see e.g Pirlot and Vincke (1997)) and those allowing incomparabil ity (see e.g. Roy, (1996) . We require only the total comparability of constants acts (i.e. the completness of (,p) which is a natural property because there is no conflict between states in the comparison of constant acts. Hence we consider the following axiom that can be seen as a useful weakening of S 1.\nAxiom AI. (, is reflexive and quasi-transitive, and its restriction to constant acts is complete.\nMoreover, as far as transitivity properties are con cerned, we need to consider at least three distinct levels on X and strengthen axiom S5 with the following:\nAxiom A5. X contains at least three consequences x, y and z such that fx >-fy >-fz.\nThen we establish the two following technical lemmas:\nLemma 1 If(, satisfies Al, AS, 83, and QI then the following property holds for any non-empty subset A of 8: [3f,g E X5 : ([j ?-p g] = A, [ g >-p f] =\nS \\A and f >-g)] ==? A is decisive\nLemma 2 If(, satisfies Al, AS, 83, and QI then 8 contains at most one predominant event.\nHence we get the following theorem:\nTheorem 1 If(, satisfies Al, AS, 83 and QI, there exists one and only one predominant event 0 in S and the resulting subjective likelihood relation >-L on events has the following properties:\ni) VA, B \u00a3;; S, (An B = 0 and A>-\u00a3 B)=? 0 n B = 0 ii) VA, B \u00a3;; S, (An B = 0 and 0 \u00a3;;A)=? A 'rL B\niii) VA\u00a3;; S, 0 \u00a3;;A {==} A>-\u00a3 S \\A\nIn other terms, when the DM preferences are quasi transitive and compatible with QI, they necessarily rely on a knowledge structure admitting a predomi nant event 0 which makes negligible any other disjoint event. Indeed f >-g holds as soon as f is preferred to\ng for all states belonging to 0. Moreover, whenever two states s and s' are conflicting within 0 concerning a pair f,g (i.e. f(s) ?-p g(s) and g(s') ?-p f(s')), no strict preference can be stated between the two acts. In Social Choice Theory, such a preference structure is said to be oligarchic (see e.g. Sen (1986)). The larger is 0, the less decisive the procedure. In case of to tal ignorance, i.e. when no state of the world is more likely than another, we get 0 = 8: the preference re lation (, reduces to the functional dominance on X5.\n194 Fargier and Pemy\nIn the other extreme case, 0 contains a single state, the DM preferences can be described by a \" dictatorial\" decision rule due to the existence of a decisive state s. Such a rule can emerge when the DM is almost certain than the \"true state\" is s and that the other states are negligible: all the other possible futures are ignored. More precisely, we can derive the following result:\nCorollary 2 If axioms Al, AS, S3,and QI hold, there exists a unique maximaP partition of S into events 01' ... 'ok' k > 1 such that 01 is predominant and Vj: 2::; j < k, event Oj is predominant in S\\U{;;;i 0; thus yielding to a hierarchy of predominant events.\nThis result is well illustrated by possibilistic and neces sity lifting rules for which A1, A5, S3 and QI hold. The possibilistic lifting corresponds to the case where only one predominant event 01 exists. It is simply defined by the core of the distribution, e.g the set of states hav ing a maximal possibility: 01 = {s E S : 7r (s) = 1}. The necessity lifting rule corresponds to the case with possibly several levels in the hierarchy, i.e. one for each distinct level-cut of the distribution 7r on S.\nNow, assuming both completeness and transitivity of \ufffd we obtain a hierarchy of predominant states:\nTheorem 2 For any preference relation among acts that satisfies Sl, 83, AS and QI, we have, for all pairs /, g E xs { 3s E S, not null, f(s) >-p g(s) f >- g \u00a2=? 'is E S, (g(s) >-p f (s) => 3s' E S :\n{s'} >-L {s} and f(s') >-P g(s'))\nThis theorem shows the lexicographic structure of pref erence and can be seen as a counterpart of Fishburn's theorem obtained in the context of multicriteria anal ysis (see F ishburn, 1975). It demonstrates a phe nomenon which was already illustrated in example 3 and also explains that comparative probabilities (and not only classical probabilities) are incompatible with a qualitative approach of decision. The resulting lexi cographic rule corresponds to a very particular struc ture of uncertainty in which all the non impossible states must be linearly ordered. As a consequence, this forbids the description of total ignorance (where the states are equally plausible). Moreover, there ex ists a predominant state s*, more plausible that any other state, and even more plausible than the event S \\ { s*}. As soon as s* gives a better consequence for an act than for another one, the first act is preferred. The other possible states of the world are negligible compared to s* and only considered when the domi nant state does not allow the discrimination between the acts. The decision is then based on the next plau sible state ...\n2maximal means here that no other partition of S re fining this one has the same property\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nThe results obtained in Section 4 are rather negative since they underline the poor descriptive ability of models satisfying both QI and the quasi-transitivity of preferences. For this reason, we have investigated possible weakening of our initial axiomatic framework.\nA first idea is relaxing axiom S3, arguing that the pref erence order on consequences may actually depend on the state of the world considered. However, using S2 we can soundly3 define, for each state Sj E S, a pref erence relation \ufffdj on X by setting:\n'Vx,y E X, X \ufffdP; Y \u00a2=? Ux \ufffd /y){s;)\nHence, from each relation \ufffdP; we can define a prefer ence relation \ufffdj on X s by setting:\nThus, under QI, linking relation \ufffd to the profile (\ufffd 1 , ... , \ufffdn) is still an ordinal aggregation problem with similar difficulties (see Sen(1986)). Thus, cancelling S3 does not really provide new possibilities.\nA second possibility is to relax partially the quasi transitivity of \ufffd on X8. In practical applications, most of the acts in X s are purely imaginary and per haps not even feasible. Hence, one can be tempted to require quasi-transitivity only on feasible acts. How ever, using example 3, we could show that this does not provide new possibilities as long as there exists a feasible subset of acts X'8' where X' \ufffd X contains at least 3 distinct elements and S' c;; S contains at least 3 non-null states. We could also consider a relaxation of quasi-transitivity for acyclicity, i.e., If f0, ... , fk E X8, ((Vi= 1, . . . , k, fi-1 >-/;) => not(fk >-fo)). In deed, acyclicity is sufficient to soundly define a choice function selecting the best elements among any non empty subset of X8:\nVY c;; X8, C(Y) = {! E Y : Vg E Y,not(g >-f)}\nHowever, we have also investigated this relaxation and proved that qualitative decision models compatible with acyclicity have also very special features. For example, they necessarily provide some state with an absolute veto, thus limiting the role of other states.\nThe last possibility is to relax axiom QI which turns out to be a very demanding condition. If we are in terested in developing a purely ordinal framework for decision under uncertainty, the most natural weaken ing of QI is to cancel the \"independence\" side of the\n382 can be seen as an independence condition allowing to derive one-dimensional preference relations from \ufffd- For more details see e.g. Fishburn and Wakker (1995)\nQualitative Models for Decision Under Uncertainty 195\ncondition while keeping the \"ordinal\" side. A good so lution for this is to assume that the preference f ;:; g not only depends on preferences f (s) ;:;P g(s), for all s, but also on preferences of type f (s) ;:;P h(s), g(s) ;:;P h(s), h(s) ;:;P f(s), h(s) ;:;P f (s) for some h in X5. This solution has been proposed in the frame work of multicriteria Decision Making so as to over come difficulties due to Arrow-like theorems (see e.g. Ferny 1992, Bouyssou and Ferny 1992). In the frame work of qualitative decision theory, it should be useful to follow the same path and to investigate non-binary preferences. As a first set of examples, consider the following relations:\nf!::J.tg = f!::J.J;g = (f !:::; h] !:::;L [g!:::; h] [h !:::; g] !:::;L [h!:::; fl\nwhere h E X is a reference point within X5 used to specify the aspiration levels of the DM, for each state of the nature. The idea underlying these rules is to compare acts by evaluating their relative abilities in satisfying or missing the D M aspirations. Another interesting set of examples is given by the following qualitative dominance relations:\nf!::J.+g = 'lx EX,[/!:::; fx] !:::;L[g!:::; fx] f!::J.-g = VxEX, [fx!:::;g]!:::;L[fx!:::;f]\nThese relations must be regarded as natural quali tative counterparts of the so-called stochastic domi nance relation used in decision under probabilistic un certainty (see Levy (1992) for a survey on this topic).\nClearly, all these relations are transitive but not nec essarily complete. When ;:; is constructed from one of these rules, unanimity holds but not the QI axiom and the theorems of this paper do not apply. These examples open new perspectives for designing purely qualitative preference models without QI. This is left for further investigation.\nFurther work also includes a parallel Savage-like ax iomatic study of models based on the comparison of the consequences of the acts in the most plausible states (see (Boutilier 1994; Tan and Pearl 1994; Braf man and Tennenholtz 1996, 1997)). These models do not require preference over consequences and uncer tainty to be commensurate and do not obey the QI requirement, but the associated decision rules, when they are explicit, also focus on a decisive set of states: the set of most plausible states. Our approach may also be compatible with generalized qualitative prob abilites (Lehman (1996)), that are incomplete orders of uncertainty and that require both the transitivity of the indifference relation and unanimity properties stronger than ours. Moreover, generalized qualitative probabilities encompass a notion of neglectibility be tween events whose links with our notion of decisive ness should be studied.\nReferences\nG.A. Bordes (1983).
