The key technical problem in Quasi-Bayesian networks is how to detect, enforce and exploit irrelevance and independence rela tions. The goal of this paper is to present novel results and algorithms that address these questions. This pa per adopts Walley's definitions of irrelevance and in vestigates two different methods to generate infereces from Quasi-Bayesian network: inferences from type1 extensions (Section 4), and inferences from natural extensions (Section 5).\nThis research was conducted while the author was with the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. The project was partially supported by NASA under Grant NAGW-1175; the author was supported under a scholar ship from CNPq, Brazil.\nThe overall contribution of this paper is a theory of lo cally defined Quasi-Bayesian networks that display the same flexibility and representational power of standard Bayesian networks. The results in this paper state the conditions that must be required or enforced to ex press judgements of irrelevance/independence through Quasi-Bayesian networks.\n2 BACKGROUND MATERIAL\n2.1 GRAPHICAL MO DELS\nA popular graphical representation of probabilistic models in AI is the Bayesian network formalism, where a directed acyclic graph is used to specify a joint dis tribution over a set of variables X [18]. Each node of a Bayesian network is associated with a variable Xi; the parents of Xi are denoted by pa(Xi)\u00b7 This paper deals with variables with a finite set of values.\nEach variable in a Bayesian network is associated with a conditional distribution p(Xijpa(Xi)). Such a graph ical structure defines a unique joint probability distri bution through the following expression [22]:\n(1)\nInferences with Bayesian networks usually involve the calculation of the posterior marginal for a queried vari able Xq given evidence E [18]. Bayesian networks represent many independence re lations among the variables in the network. These relations can be analyzed through the concept of d separation: if Y d-separates X from Z, then X and Z are independent given events defined by Y [22, page 117].\nOne difficulty with Bayesian networks is the require ment that all probability distributions must be pre cisely specified. Several non-probabilistic attempts have been made to relax the requirements of Bayesian\n90 Cozman\nnetworks through alternative theories of inference (12, 25, 26], or through interval-valued probabilities (2, 11, 16, 15]. Interval representations have two prob lems. First, it is not always possible to apply Bayes rule to an interval-valued distribution and obtain an interval-valued posterior distribution (7, 15]. Second, there is no unique, accepted way to define indepen dence for interval-valued distributions (6].\nClosed convex sets of distributions are also models for imprecision in probability values (1, 15, 24, 28]. Closed convex sets of distributions have several ad vantages when compared to interval-valued probabil ity because conditionalization and independence can be defined without technical difficulties. In this pa per, closed convex sets of distributions are employed as fundamental entities that reflect perturbations and imprecision about stochastic phenomena.\nOne axiomatization of closed convex sets of distribu tions that is particularly concise and powerful is the Quasi-Bayesian theory of Giron and Rios (14]. This theory is summarized in the next section; several re cent definitions and results, not present in the original theory by Giron and Rios, are incorporated in the pre sentation.\n2.2 QUASI-BAYESIAN THEORY\nQuasi-Bayesian theory (14] uses convex sets of distri butions to represent beliefs and to evaluate decisions.\nCredal sets The convex set of distributions main tained by an agent is called the agent's credal set, and its existence is postulated on the grounds of axioms about preferences (14]. 1 To simplify terminology, the term credal set is used only when it refers to a set of distributions containing more than one element. A closed convex set of joint distributions is called a joint credal set.\nThis paper deals with credal sets that are defined as the convex hull of a finite number of probability dis tributions; such finitely generated credal sets are poly topes in the space of probability distributions.\nLower and upper values Given a convex set K of probability distributions, a probability interval can be created for every event A by defining lower and upper bounds:\np(A) = inf p(A), - pEK p(A) = sup p(A).\npEK\n1 An introduction to technical aspects of Quasi-Bayesian theory, with a larger list of references, can be found at http:/ jwww.cs.cmu.edu/-fgcozman/qBayes.html.\nLower and upper expectations for a function f (X) are defined as ( Ep [f ] is the expectation of the function f):\nE[f ] = inf Ep[f], E[f ] =sup Ep[f]. pEK pEK There is a one-to-one correspondence between lower (or upper) expectations and credal sets. Given a credal set, the set of all lower expectations for all arbitrary functions f (X) is unique, and vice-versa.\nConditionalization Convex sets of conditional dis tributions are used to represent conditional beliefs. In ference is performed by applying Bayes rule to each distribution in a jont credal set. The posterior credal set is the union of all posterior distributions obtained in this process, and the vertices of the posterior credal set are obtained by applying Bayes rule to all vertices of the joint credal set (28]. Denote by K(X!Y) the col lection of credal sets K(XIA) for all events A defined by a variable Y .\nIndependence There is no unique way to define in dependence relations with credal sets; in the most in depth study of this matter, Campos and Moral have reviewed five different possible types of independence (10]. The results presented in this paper adopt Wal ley's definition of independence (28]. Walley's original definition is stated in terms of lower expectations; to develop a theory of convex sets of distributions, it is important to recast Walley's definition using credal sets as follows.\nConsider sets of variables X, Y and Z and the credal sets K(X, Y, Z), K(X!Z), K(Y!Z), K(X!Y, Z) and K(YIX, Z). Note that distributions in K(XIZ) and K(XIY, Z) are defined over the same algebra of events once Y and Z are fixed; likewise, distributions in K(YIZ) and K(Y!X, Z) are defined over the same al gebra of events once X and Z are fixed.\nDefinition 1 Variables Y are irrelevant to X given Z if K(X!Z) is equal to K(XIf' , Z) regardless of the value of Y, Z. Variables X and Y are independent given Z if X is irrelevant to Y given Z and Y is irrel evant to X given Z. If Z is empty, suppress the \"given Z\" from this definition.\nThis concept of independence does not imply that joint credal sets contain only joint distributions with inde pendent marginals, nor does it imply uniqueness for the joint credal set (28, Chapter 9].\n3 LOCALLY DEFINED QUASI-BAYESIAN NETWORKS\nThis section defines Quasi-Bayesian networks that are generated from local models associated to a directed\nacyclic graph:\nDefinition 2 A locally defined Quasi-Bayesian net work is a directed acyclic graph associated with: (1} either a single conditional distribution p(Xilpa(Xi)) or a local credal set K(Xilpa(Xi)) for each variable Xi, (2} a collection of irrelevance relations, and (3} a method for the combination of local credal sets.\nA joint credal set that satisfies all constraints and re lations in a Quasi-Bayesian network is called an exten sion of the network.\nThe rationale for this definition is as follows. In a standard Bayesian network, irrelevance and indepen dence constraints are implicit in Expression (1); this expression guarantees that a variable is independent of all its non-descendants given its parents [22, page 119]. There is no analogue to Expression (1) in Quasi Bayesian networks. Many extensions may satisfy all graphical d-separation relations in a network. It seems more appropriate to ask a decision maker to explic itly indicate which qualitative constraints are to be enforced in a Quasi-Bayesian network, and to ask for irrelevance constraints instead of independence con straints, because irrelevance and independence are not equivalent in Quasi-Bayesian models (Section 2.2).\nThe key fact is that a directed acyclic graph and a collection of local credal sets may admit more than one extension; the next sections investigate two important types of extension.\n4 TYPE-1 EXTENSION\nThe most popular type of extension disussed in the literature is the type-1 extension [4, 27]. A type-1 ex tension is the convex hull of all the joint distributions formed by cross-multiplication of extreme points of lo cal credal sets; consequently, a type-1 extension is the largest joint credal set where all extreme points satisfy Expression ( 1).\nThe appeal of type-1 extensions comes from their intu itive similarity with standard Bayesian networks. The following theorem formalizes this intuition using Wal ley's definition of independence:\nTheorem 1 Every graphical d-separation relation in a Quasi-Bayesian network corresponds to a valid con ditional independence relation in the type-1 extension of the network. (Proof in Appendix A.1.}\nThis result demonstrates that type-1 extensions mimic the properties of standard Bayesian networks as independence-maps [22, page 119]. The theorem also complements results by Cano et al. [4]. They give\nQuasi-Bayesian Networks 91\nconditions on independence concepts that satisfy d separation in type-1 extensions, but they do not pro vide any definition of independence to illustrate their result. The theorem demonstrates that Walley's inde pendence relations exhibit the desired correspondence with d-separation.\nD-separation has important algorithmic consequences. Graphical operations that are guaranteed by d separation can be performed in a type-1 extension. In particular, consider a query involving a variable X q and evidence E. All variables that do not af fect computation of p(XqiE) can be detected through d-separation computations [13]. This greatly reduces the computational effort in Quasi-Bayesian inferences with type-1 extensions both for exact (enumeration) and approximate (sampling, iterative) algorithms [9]. The theorem in this section completes that investiga tion with a formal proof that d-separation can (and should) be used to handle type-1 extensions.\n5 NATURAL EXTENSION\nType-1 extensions are not the only possible extension of a locally defined Quasi-Bayesian network. The nat ural extension of the network is the largest set of joint distributions compatible with local credal sets and ir relevance relations in the network. This terminology has been sugested by Walley [28, pages 453, 455], who explores properties of natural extensions but does not focus on multivariate structures.\nA Quasi-Bayesian network is defined by quantita tive constraints on probability values and by qual itative statements of irrelevance and independence. The quantitative constraints that define a credal set K(Xilpa(Xi)) are denoted by Ct (p(Xilpa(Xi))]. The objective of this section is to investigate and ex ploit the representation of qualitative statements of irrelevance and independence in natural extensions, particulary statements that involve variables and their nondescendants. Many different natural extensions can be created for a given directed acyclic graph through different statements of irrelevance (Section 3).\nThe algorithms focus on irrelevance and independence conditional on the nondescendants of a node. This strategy follows common practice in Bayesian net works, which are based on the agreement between d separation and irrelevance/independence [22]; for nat ural extension, this strategy has a simple justification as follows. When stating irrelevance/independence re lations among variables, it is important to guarantee that a natural extension can actually be constructed. incompatible relations can lead to an empty natural extension. One strategy that always produces valid\n92 Cozman\nnatural extensions is to rely on graphical d-separations as the source of irrelevance/independence relations, because there is always at least one standard Bayesian joint distribution that complies with all constraints. This rationale suggests that irrelevance/independence relations among variables and their nondescendants are of primary interest.\n5.1 SPECIF YING CONDITIONAL\nCRE DAL SE TS SEPARATELY\nThe following algorithms assume that constraints on conditional distributions are defined separately for each value of the variable's parents. This means that, for any variable Xi, the constraints Cz[p(Xil[pa(Xi)]k1)] do not interfere with the con straints for Cz[p(Xil[pa(Xi)]k2)] when k1 =j:. kz. This restriction makes sense both during elicitation of mod els and representation of constraints, and the following derivations exploit this restriction to generate infer ence algorithms.\nConsider first the quantitative constraints Cz [p(Xil[pa(Xi)]k)]. Because all local credal sets have a finite number of vertices, all constraints Cz [p(Xil[pa(Xi)]k)] are linear in p(Xil[pa(Xi)]k)\u00b7 Be cause the value of pa(Xi) is fixed in every constraint, all constraints are of the form:\nIX\u2022 I L rijklP(Xi = Xij, [pa(Xi)]k) :::; /iOklP([pa(Xi)]k), j==l\n(2) where /ijkl are constants that define the local credal sets. Note that these constraints are linear in p(X), because p(Xi, pa(Xi)) and p(pa(Xi)) are summations over p(X).\nNote that, if a single distribution q is specified for vari able }i, the only constraint imposed on the conditional distribution for Yi is:\n5.2 LINE AR FRACTIONAL"}, {"heading": "PRO GRAMMING IN NATURAL EXTENSIONS", "text": "The objective here is to calculate posterior upper bounds (lower bounds are obtained by minimization):\n-ex IE)_ l:x.E(X\\{Xq,E}) P(x) p q - max -\nLx. E(X\\E) p(X) (3)\nTo guarantee that all credal sets contain valid distribu tions, the following unitary con.straint must be added: LxP(X) =I.\nThe simplest natural extension is produced when no ir relevance relations are associated to a Quasi-Bayesian network [9]. In this case, the maximization in Expres sion (3), subject to linear constraints in Expressions (2) and the unitary constraint, is a linear fractional program. To guarantee that this linear fractional pro gram has a solution, it is necessary to check that p (E) is non-zero; if p (E) = 0, then the posterior lower en velope p (X q I E) is also zero [28]. Linear fractional pro grams can be reduced to linear programs by a variety of methods [17, 23]; consequently, Quasi-Bayesian in ferences (without irrelevance relations) can be solved by linear programming techniques.\n5.3 REPRESENTATION OF\nIRRELEVANCE RELATIONS\nSuppose that a variable Xi is associated with a credal set K(Xdpa(Xi)) and that the variables Wi are judged irrelevant to Xi given pa(Xi)\u00b7 To represent the irrel evance relation, it is necessary to expand each con straint Cz [p(Xilpa(Xi))] into a family of constraints Cz [p(Xilpa(Xi), Wi = Wij)]. Note that a new con straint is added for each value of wi.\n5.4 IRRELEVANCE CONSTRAINTS FOR NONDESCENDANTS\nConsider the constraint that, for every variable Xi, nondescendants of xi are irrelevant to xi given the parents of Xi. For a variable Xi, denote the nondescendants of Xi by nd(Xi)\u00b7 Irrelevance con straints are satisfied by extending the replicating Cz[p(Xil[pa(Xi))]k] for all the values of nondescen dants nd(Xi) such that pa(Xi) = [pa(Xi)]k. De note the set of constraints obtained in this manner by Cz[p(Xilnd(Xi))]. By construction, if a joint dis tribution satisfies constraints Cz[p(Xilnd(Xi))], then it satisfies constraints Cz[p(Xil[pa(Xi)]k)] (Appendix A.2).\nLower bounds are calculated by forming a linear frac tional program with Expression (3) subject to lin ear constraints Cz[p(Xilnd(Xi))) and the unitary con straint. Even though irrelevance relations introduce a large number of constraints into this program, they also introduce simplifications into the problem, as demonstrated in the remainder of this section.\nConsider a Quasi-Bayesian network where a group of variables Z is associated with credal sets. Construct the set S containing all variables in Z and all variables that are predecessors of variables in Z. Call W the set of all variables that are not in S.\nTheorem 2 The calculation of Expression {3) can be\ndone by the solution of the program:\nsubject to Ls p(S) = 1 and\nIZ\u2022I ( ) L 'Yijkl L p(S) -j=l Z, E( {S}\\ {Z;, nd(Z;)}) 'YiOkl L p(S) < 0,\nZ,E(S\\nd(Z;))\nwhere the function q' is:\n{Proof in Appendix A. 3).\n(5)\nThe linear fractional program in this theorem is not a problem on variables X, but a reduced maximization problem where only the values for p(S) are free to vary. A standard Bayesian network algorithm generates q' by essentially eliminating all variables in W.\nThe consequence of the theorem is that networks where most local credal sets are on the \"top\" of the graph can profit from irrelevance constraints. This is particularly promising in practical applications, be cause in general the most imprecise distributions are the priors, which are associated with nodes without parents.\n5.5 REPRESENTATION OF INDEPENDENCE RELATIONS\nTo guarantee that Yi is independent of Xi given pa(Xi), it is necessary to enforce that: (1) Yi is ir relevant to Xi given pa(Xi), and (2) Xi is irrele vant to Yi given pa(Xi)\u00b7 The first constraint has been addressed in the previous paragraph, but the second constraint introduces new complexities into the problem. For example, suppose that a variable x5 has variables xl' x3' x4 as nondescendants, and X2 as parent. The second irrelevance condition re quires that the credal sets K(X1, X3, X4IXz, X5) and K(X1, Xz, X4IXz) contain the same functions. The difficulty is that neither of these credal sets is directly specified on the network; there is no simple constraint that ties them together.\n5.6 INDEPENDENCE CONSTRAINTS FOR NONDESCENDANTS\nConsider the constraint that, for every variable Xi, nondescendants of xi are independent from xi given the parents of Xi: The nondescendants of Xi must be irrelevant to xi, and xi must be irrelevant to its nondescendants given the parents of Xi. No ef ficient algorithm for inferences with such constraints is known; construction of a complex, non-linear op timization program is the only method that can be generally adopted at this point.\n6 EXAMPLE\nTo illustrate the results and algorithms described pre viously, a simple example is discussed in this section. This example is based on the example described by Charniak [5] and on the calculations presented by Wal ley [28, Section 9.3.4].\nConsider the graph in Figure 1. There are five bi nary variables in the graph (the superscript c indicates negation). These relationships are summarized by the probabilistic model presented in Figure 1. Note that the probabilities for f and b are not specified exactly; instead, they are given as an interval (0.4, 0.5]. The question is how to evaluate the impact of this impre cision in probability values. To illustrate the various algorithms discussed in the paper, consider the calcu lation of l!. ( dll) and p ( dll).\nType-1 extension The simplest method to obtain the bounds is to identify the vertices of the local credal sets and generate a type-1 extension. The type-1 ex-\n94 Cozman\ntension has four vertices, because both the credal sets K(f) and K(b) have vertices (0.4, 0.6) and (0.5, 0.5). By calculating p( djl) for these four vertices, the bounds on p(djl) are obtained: the lower bound on p(djl) is 0.38615 and the upper bound is 0.44615.\nNatural extension without irrelevance relations If no irrelevance relation is stated concerning the net work, then the expressions in Figure 1 and the unitary constraint are the only restrictions on the natural ex tension. To generate lower and upper bounds on p(djl), it is necessary to write these thirteen linear constraints (nine are equality constraints and four are inequality constraints) and solve a linear fractional program with the objective function p(d, l)/p(l). The solution of this program produces the lower bound 0 and the upper bound 1 for p(djl), demonstrating that the absence of irrelevance relations can lead to inferences that are es sentially vacuous.\nNat ural extension with irrelevance relations Consider the effect of adding irrelevance relations, in particular the statement that the nondescendants of a variable are irrelevant to the variable given the par ents of the variable. Four constraints represent this statement regarding credal sets: 0.4 ::; p(fjb) ::; 0.5 and 0.4 ::; p(bjf) ::; 0.5. To simplify the calculation of lower and upper bounds, Theorem 2 can be used. The upper bound is obtained by solving the program:\n-3 0 2 0 0 2 0 -2 0 0 0 -3 0 2\nX [ \ufffd\ufffd l 0 s.t. 0 2 0 -2 < 0\n-3 2 0 0 0 2 -2 0 0 0 0 0 -3 2 0 0 0 2 -2 0\nand l:wi = 1 (w1 = p(f, b), w2 = p(f, bc), w3 = p(jC, b), W4 = p(jC, bC)). This program produces the upper bound 0.4509. By minimization, the lower bound 0.3818 is obtained. Note that these bounds are different from the bounds obtained by type-1 exten sion.\nNatural extension with independence con straints The strongest statement considered here is the independence of a variable and its non descendants given its parents. The natural ex tension is then derived from the full joint credal set K(f, b), which has six vertices: 1/4(1, 1, 1, 1), (0.36, 0.24, 0.24, 0.16), 1/10(2, 2., 3, 3), 1/10(2, 3, 2, 3), 1/9(2, 2, 2, 3), 1/11(2, 3, 3, 3). Computation of p(djl)\nin each of the six joint distribution leads to the lower bound 0.3818 and the upper bound 0.4509.\n7 CONCLUSION\nThe central contribution of this paper is the applica tion of Walley's definitions of irrelevance and indepen dence to the study of locally defined Quasi-Bayesian networks. The main technical contributions are novel algorithms for inference with natural extensions; re search must now be conducted to limit the combi natorial explosion that occurs in the formulation of linear fractional programs for inferences with natural extensions. The paper also ties type-1 extensions to d separation; this result provides a formal basis for the conceptual and computational attractiveness of type-1 extensions.\nThis paper focused on the calculation of upper bounds for the posterior probability of the event {X q = X qj}. Other problems can be solved using the same algo rithms. For example, calculation of inferences for non atomic events A is immediate only by enlarging the summations that must be computed in the inference procedures. Algorithms presented in this paper also apply to calculation of lower and upper expectation, by enlarging summations and objective functions in linear programs.\nThe results presented in this paper pose an intellec tually challenging question: Should we consider ir relevance or independence as a basic notion in the treatment of uncertainty? Both notions agree in stan dard probability theory, but they disagree in Quasi Bayesian theory. Irrelevance is a more basic notion, as it can be used to define independence, and irrele vance judgements are less forceful than independence ones but still quite powerful. Should irrelevance be a more fundamental notion? This question can only be answered as research and applications are developed using Quasi-Bayesian models.\nA PROOFS\nA.l THEOREM 1\nThe following is a sketch for the proof of Theorem 1; a more detailed proof is available (8].\nConsider three arbitrary disjoint sets of variables in the network, X, Y and Z, such that X is d-separated from Z given Y. Take the type-1 extension K(X, Y, Z) and obtain, by conditionalization, K(XjY, Z) and K(XjY). Call extK the set of extreme points of K.\nGiven any function J(X) tain its lower expectation solely of X, E[f(X)jY, Z] ob-\nminpEextK(XIf',z) (l:x f(X)p(X!Y, Z)) . The mm imum is attained at an extreme point of the type-1 extension. Because every such extreme point satisfies Expression (1), p(X!Y, Z) = p(XrY) for these poiints (by d-separation), and the lower expectation is equal to E[f(X)!Y]. Because a lower expectation uniquely defines a convex set of distributions (Section 2. 2), the lower expectation E[f(X)rY] uniquely defines K(XrY) and the lower ex pectation E[f(X)!Y, Z] uniquely defines K(X!Y, Z). Because both lower expectations are equal for arbi trary f, the underlying credal sets are the same. This argument guarantees that Z is irrelevant to X given Y; the same argument proves that X is irrelevant to Z given Y. So X is independent of Z given Y.\nA.2 RELEVANT LEMMAS\nThe following result is used in Section 5.4:\nLemma 1 If a joint distribution satisfies con straints Ct[p(Xi/nd(Xi))], then it satisfies constraints Cl[p(Xi/pa(Xi))].\nTo prove this result, take W(Xi) = 0 in the following theorem.\nLemma 2 Consider a joint distribution that satisfies constraints Cl[p(Xi/nd(Xi))], and for every node Xi, W(Xi) is a subset of nd(Xi) that does not overlap with the parents of Xi. Then the following constraints also satisfied:\nIX; I L \"'!ijklP(Xi = Xij/[pa(Xi)]k> W(Xi)) :S \"'!iOkl\u00b7 (6) j=l\nSketch of proof. Consider an arbitrary joint distribu tion satisfying constraints C![p(Xi/nd(Xi))]. Denote the set (nd(Xi)\\{pa(Xi), W(Xi)}) by W1(Xi)\u00b7 Ob tain by marginalization the distribution of W1(Xi), p(W1(Xi)). Select all constraints that are repetitions of a single original constraint for fixed [pa(Xi)]k. These con straints are all identical, except that values of W(Xi) and W1(Xi) vary across constraints. Multiply every one of these constraints by the appropriate value of p(W1 (Xi)), and add all constraints that refer to a par ticular value of W(Xi)i constraints (6) are then ob tained after algebraic manipulations.\nA.3 THEOREM 2\nFirst note that the linear fractional program in the statement of the theorem is identical to the following\nQuasi-Bayesian Networks 95\nprogram:\n-(X /E) = ( l:X;E(X\\{Xq,E})p(X) ) P q max _ ,\nl:x;E(X\\E) p(X) (7)\nsubject to constraints (5), l:sP(S) = 1 and p(X) = q(W/S)p(S), where\nq(W/S) = II q(Wi/pa(Wi)). (8) W;EW\nNote that q(W/S) is the unique joint distribution for W givenS. Uniqueness is guaranteed by the fact that the variables in W form a Bayesian network: (1) irrel evance is equal to independence in standard Bayesian networks; (2) Lemma 2 guarantees that all irrelevance conditions are valid when restricted to the network of W; (3) independence of a variable from its nondescen dants given its parents characterizes a unique Bayesian network [22].\nThe strategy of the proof is to demonstrate that the linear program expressed by (7) subject to constraints (5), (8) and l:s p(S) = 1, is identical to program (3) subject to C![p(Xi/nd(Xi))] and the unitary con straint.\nStart from program (3). Uniqueness of q(W/S) leads to constraints:\nwhich are equivalent to the constraints summarized by Expression (8). Use this equality in Expressions Cl[p(Xi/nd(Xi))] and the unitary constraint. Expres sion l:s p(S) = 1 is immediately obtained from the unitary constraint. For constraints C1[p(Xi/nd(Xi))], divide W in two sets of variables; W1 contains vari ables in w that are nondescendants of xi, and W11 contains variables in W that are descendants of Xi. Constraints C![p(Xi/ nd(Xi))] become:\nIX\u2022I ( ) L \"Yijkl L q(W11/S, W1)q(W1/S)p(S) j=l X\\{X;,nd(X;)} -\"'(iOkl L q(W11/S, W1)q(W1/S)p(S) :S 0.\nX\\nd(X;)\nThe summations involve all variables in W11, so these variables can be summed out. Variables in W1 are fixed and make no reference to Xi or any of its de scendants, so they can be taken out of the summation and cancelled. These operations reduce the inequality above to constraint (5). The only situation where this cancellation cannot occur is when a node has no nonde scendants; in this case, all other nodes are descendants\n96 Cozman\nof the node and are summed out so the result holds. This proves that program (7) subject to (5), (8), and Ls p(S) = 1, is identical to program (3) subject to Ct[p(Xijnd(Xi))] and the unitary constraint.\nAcknowledgements\nI thank my former advisor, Eric Krotkov, for substan tial support during the research that led to this work.\nReferences\n(1) J. 0.
