There is a fundamental difference between not knowing about which events obtain and the inability to conceive of some events. Unawareness is an interdisciplinary topic that fascinates economists, computer scientists, logicians, and philosophers alike. Traditionally, computer scientists, logicians and philosophers are interested in epistemic models while most economists are mainly interested in the behavioral implications. In the literature, unawareness has been defined epistemically using syntactic and semantic approaches.1 While epistemic characterizations are conceptually insightful, the behavioral content of unawareness is less clear. Can unawareness be characterized behaviorally?\nA first attempt to answer this question is presented in Schipper (2012). There we apply the lattice state-space structure of Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006, 2008, 2013) to the Anscombe-Aumann approach to subjective utility theory and characterize awarenessdependent subjective expected utility. This framework allows us to distinguish unawareness of an event from the event being Savage null and thus we are able to show behavioral implications of unawareness. Yet, our approach in Schipper (2012) has many shortcomings. For instance, as in almost any decision theoretic framework, we consider states of nature rather than states of the world. That is, states describe just lists of physical events but are silent on the state of mind of the decision maker. While such an approach is sensible in a purely decision theoretic framework, where bets are placed on physical events rather than (higher order) beliefs of some players, it does not allow for characterizing behaviorally - at least in principle - the intricate epistemic properties of knowledge and awareness across the lattice structure introduced in Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006, 2008). For instance, introspection of knowledge requires bets on events in which the decision maker knows an event.\nMorris (1996, 1997) showed for standard state-spaces with states of the world that properties of knowledge and belief can be - at least in principle - characterized behaviorally. In this paper, we extend his approach to unawareness structures and show how to characterize behaviorally properties of the possibility correspondence introduced in Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006). Moreover, we show how to characterize preferencebased operators of knowledge, awareness, and unawareness.\nThis work is directly related to a growing literature on unawareness. Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006, 2008, 2013) introduced a syntax-free semantics of unawareness using state-spaces familiar to economists, decision theorists, and game theorists. Apart from having a syntax-free semantics, Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006, 2008) generalize Modica and Rustichini (1999) to the multi-agent case. The precise connection between Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006) on one hand and Modica and Rustichini (1999) and earlier work in computer science by Fagin and Halpern (1988) on the other hand is understood from Halpern (2001), Halpern and Re\u0302go (2008, 2012), and Heifetz, Meier, and\n1For a bibliography see http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/schipper/unaw.htm\nSchipper (2008). Galanis (2012) relaxes some properties of the possibility correspondence in Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006). The connection between Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006, 2008) and Galanis (2012) is explored in Galanis (2011). Li (2009) presents an alternative to modeling unawareness in the single-agent case. Heinsalu (2012) explores the connection between Li (2009) and the rest of the literature. Finally, Feinberg (2012) presents an approach of modeling unawareness in the context of games. The precise connection between Feinberg (2012) and the rest of the literature is yet to be explored. The literature addressed also awareness of unawareness, see Board and Chung (2011), Halpern and Re\u0302go (2009, 2012a), Sillari (2008), A\u030agotnes and Alechina (2007), and Walker (2013). The relationship between Board and Chung (2011) and Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006) is studied in Board, Chung, and Schipper (2011). The relationship between Halpern and Rego (2009, 2012a) and Heifetz, Meier and Schipper (2006) is explored in Halpern and Rego (2012a). See Section 4 for further discussions of the related literature.\nIn the next section we provide a brief exposition of unawareness structures and review properties of knowledge and awareness. In Section 3 we introduce the decision theoretic framework and provide the results. We conclude with a discussion in Section 4.

First note that in order to \u201creveal\u201d whether a decision maker\u2019s possibility correspondence satisfies properties 0. to 5., many counterfactual choice experiments have to be performed. For\n8This condition characterizes behaviorally unawareness in Schipper (2012) using a states-of-nature lattice structure and the Anscombe-Aumann approach.\ninstance, we first may have to conduct choice experiments at a state \u03c9 at which the decision maker may be unaware of both events E and F . Then we may have to consider choice experiments at a state \u03c9\u2032, at which the decision maker may be aware of E but unaware of F , and then at yet another state \u03c9\u2032\u2032 at which he is unaware of E but aware of F etc. But how should this be practically done? If these choice experiments are conducted sequentially, then it requires that after becoming aware of the E the decision maker must become unaware of E before we can conduct the last set of choice experiments.9 More natural is the interpretation of the model as the belief of another player (or the modeler) about the decision maker\u2019s choices at various states. While this interpretation may appear unusual at a first glance, we would argue that it corresponds rather closely to the actual treatment of decision theoretic models by decision theorists. Despite the emphasis on preferences revealed by choices, most decision theorists chose not to conduct choice experiments and many choice theoretic \u201caxioms\u201d are just of technical nature (e.g., continuity axioms) or impractical to implement in actual choice experiments (e.g., axioms on conditional preferences). Such \u201caxioms\u201d are testable just in \u201cprinciple\u201d. That is, they represent the belief of the modeler about how a decision maker would perform in certain choice experiments when he is ascribed a certain utility representation.10\nOur analysis is subject to another caveat raised previously in Schipper (2012). Property 1 implies that the events of which the decision maker is unaware of do not affect her ranking of acts. This holds even for composite acts conditioned on events that the decision maker is unaware of. More generally, it rules out that a decision maker becomes aware of an event merely from facing an act. This is also the implicit assumption in standard decision theory (i.e., different acts do not change the subset of \u201csmall worlds\u201d that a decision maker pays attention to). Yet, there it is less problematic since there is just one set of \u201csmall worlds\u201d. But it may be unrealistic in some situations with unawareness. Sometimes, when facing an act, a decision maker may become in very subtle ways a bit more careful with the \u201cfine prints\u201d of acts, and this care may lead her to become aware of events. E.g., a buyer facing a decision about whether or not to enter into a certain purchase contract may become aware of events that she was previously unaware of when reading all the fine prints of the contract. If ex ante an outside observer does not know how acts affect the awareness of a decision maker, then it may be impossible to design choice experiments required to elicit properties of the static possibility correspondence.\nOur analysis differs from the one presented in Schipper (2012) in several aspects. First, we mentioned already that Schipper (2012) considers states of nature while we consider states of the world. Latter approach allows us to talk about knowledge of knowledge etc.\n9Another difficulty that this model shares with Morris (1996, 1997) is how to phrase practically bets on events corresponding to (even higher order) beliefs of some events.\n10Our interpretation of the decision theoretic model is also reminiscent of the interpretation of the notion of strategy in extensive-form games. As Rubinstein (1991) pointed out, an action prescribed by a strategy at an information set which is excluded by an earlier move of that very strategy is implicitly interpreted in game theory as the beliefs that the other players entertain regarding the player\u2019s move if that information set were reached.\nSecond, while Schipper (2012) considers Anscombe-Aumann acts, i.e., mappings from states to mixtures over outcomes, we consider here real-valued Savage acts, i.e., mappings from states to real numbers. Third, Schipper (2012) aims at subjective expected utility representation theorems with probabilistic beliefs while we focus on characterizing the qualitative notions of knowledge, awareness, and unawareness. Our analysis is related to Li (2008) who seeks to study the difference between unawareness and zero probability as well.\nMorris (1996) also related dynamic preferences to properties of belief change. Dynamic unawareness has been analyzed in epistemic frameworks (van Dittmarsch and French 2009, 2011a, b, Hill, 2010), in game theoretic settings (Feinberg, 2012, Grant and Quiggin, 2013, Halpern and Re\u0302go, 2012b, Re\u0302go and Halpern, 2012, Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper, 2011a, b, Li, 2006, Meier and Schipper, 2011), and more recently also in a decision theoretic framework by Karni and Vier\u00f8 (2013). The latter approach is confined to states of nature, i.e., the beliefs of the decision maker are not part of the description of the state. We leave a decision theoretic analysis of dynamic unawareness with states of the world analogous to Morris (1996) to future research."}, {"heading": "A Proofs", "text": "A.1 Proof of Lemma 1\n\u201c\u21d2\u201d: Suppose there exists S \u2208 S and \u03c9 \u2208 S such that \u03a0\u0303(\u03c9) \u2286 S \u2032 with S \u2032 S.

It follows that f{\u03c9\u2032}g \u227b (\u03c9) h{\u03c9\u2032}g for some f, g, h \u2208 A implies \u03c9\u2032 \u2208 E.

Note that f \u2032, h\u2032, g\u2032 \u2208 A. Then from f{\u03c9\u2032}g \u227b (\u03c9) h{\u03c9\u2032}g for some f, g, h \u2208 A implies \u03c9\u2032 \u2208 E follows that f \u2032Eg \u2032 \u227b (\u03c9) h\u2032Eg \u2032 for some f \u2032, g\u2032, h\u2032 \u2208 A, yielding property (ii).\nNote that property (i) in the definition of K\u0303 holds trivially if E = S(E)\u2191. Assume E $ S(E)\u2191. From \u03a0\u0303(\u03c9) \u2286 E follows that \u03c9\u2032 \u2208 \u00acE implies \u03c9\u2032 /\u2208 \u03a0\u0303(\u03c9). Thus f{\u03c9\u2032}g \u223c (\u03c9) h{\u03c9\u2032}g for all f, g, h \u2208 A. Since \u2126 is finite, we can enumerate all states in \u00acE from lets say 1 to n.

Hence \u03c9 \u2208 K\u0303(E).\n\u201c\u2286\u201d: \u03c9 \u2208 K\u0303(E) if and only if (i) f\u00acEg \u223c (\u03c9) h\u00acEg for all f, g, h \u2208 A, and (ii) fEg \u227b (\u03c9) hEg for some f, g, h \u2208 A. Consider first (i). For any \u03c9\n\u2032 \u2208 \u00acE, arguments made above imply f{\u03c9\u2032}g \u223c (\u03c9) h{\u03c9\u2032}g for all f, g, h \u2208 A if we let \u03c9 \u2032 = \u03c91. It follows that \u03a0\u0303(\u03c9) \u2229 \u00acE = \u2205.\nConsider now property (ii) of the definition of K\u0303. We claim that for some \u03c9\u2032 \u2208 E, f{\u03c9\u2032}g \u227b (\u03c9) h{\u03c9\u2032}g for some f, g, h \u2208 A.

This paper extends this preference-based approach to unawareness structures (Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper, 2006, 2008). By defining unawareness and knowledge in terms of preferences over acts in unawareness structures and showing their equivalence to the epistemic notions of unawareness and knowledge, we try to build a bridge between decision theory and epistemic logic. Unawareness of an event is characterized behaviorally as the event being null and its negation being null.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
