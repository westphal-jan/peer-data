A class of graphical models of partic ular interest are the class of directed acyclic mod els called Bayesian networks. Pearl introduced d separation as a rule to infer the independence facts from a given directed acyclic graph; the indepen dence facts are implied to hold of any distribution which factors according to the given directed acyclic graph. An alternative equivalent rule has been pro posed by Lauritzen et al. (1990). Geiger et al. (1990) have shown that d-separation is atomic-complete for independence statements for discrete Bayesian net works; one is able to infer all of the independence facts that are logically entailed by the structure of a Bayesian network. In this paper I show that d separation has the property of strong completeness for discrete Bayesian networks; one is able to infer all of the disjunctive and/or conjunctive combinations of in dependence statements that are logically entailed by the structure of a Bayesian network. This result shows that d-separation as a rule of inference can not be im proved upon even when one restricts attention to dis crete variables.\nThe proof of strong completeness uses a measure theoretic approach which has important implications for one major approach to learning Bayes networks.\n*E-mail address: cmb:Ciandrew.cmu.edu\nBroadly speaking, there are two types of approaches to learning Bayesian networks; the scoring approaches (Bayesian, Likelihood and MDL; see Cooper and Her skovits 1992, Heckerman et al. 1994, Sclove 1994 and Bouckaert 1993) and the independence approaches (see Pearl 1988 and Spirtes et al. 1993). The independence approaches have been shown to be asymptotically reli able assuming that the population distribution stands in a certain relationship to the structure to be learned. The distribution which stands in this relationship to the structure has been called by many names, e.g., faithful (Spirtes et al. 1993), stable (Pearl and Verma 1991) and the structure has been named a perfect map of such a distribution (Pearl 1988). I demonstrate that faithful multinomial distributions exist for every directed acyclic graph and every discrete statespace. Furthermore, in a specific measure-theoretic sense, al most all multinomial distributions are faithful.\nThe new results in this paper are about discrete Bayesian networks. Strong completeness and the ex istence of faithful distributions has been shown pre viously for the class of Gaussian distributions. The discrete (multinomial) case is of special interest since many of the applications of machine learning and data modeling involve discrete data. I include the results for the Gaussian case and give a new and uniform proof of the results for both the Gaussian and multinomial cases.\n2 STRONG COMPLETENESS AND\nD-SEPARATION\nPearl introduced d-separation as a rule to infer the independence facts implied by a particular directed acyclic graph. An alternative equivalent rule has been proposed by Lauritzen et al. (1990). Consider the question of whether using d-separation one can infer all of the statements about independence which are entailed by the structure of a Bayesian network. Pearl (Pearl 1988 and Geiger and Pearl 1988b) say that d separation can not be improved upon. However their proof relies upon Gaussian distributions and thus fails if one restricts attention to the multinomial (discrete)\n412 Meek\ncase. In this section it is shown that d-separation is complete even when one restricts attention to multi nomial distributions. This bolsters the claim made by Pearl (1988) that d-separation can not be improved upon.1\nThe basic goal of a logic is to derive statements en tailed by the assumptions. In the case of the logic of Bayesian networks one is interested in deriving in dependence statements from a directed acyclic graph G = (V, E) which are true of any distribution P from a specific class of distributions over V for which G is an I-map (see Pearl 1988)2\u2022 We use P to denote an arbitrary class of distributions, PN to denote the class of multivariate normal distributions, and Pv for the class of multinomial distributions.\nLet i range over atomic independence statements, AilBIC for disjoint sets A, Band C. The statement \"AilBIC\" is read \"A is independent of B given C.\" Let I range over (i) independence statements and (ii) finite conjunctions and disjunctions of I statements. G entails I (written G f=p I) if and only if I is true in every distribution in P for which G is an I-map.\nAs with any logical calculi, there are rules of inference. The central rule of inference in this logic is that of d separation. The first question one asks about a rule of inference is whether it is sound. The soundness of d-separation as a rule of inference has been demon strated in Geiger et al. (1988b). The next question one asks about a set of inference rule is whether the set of rules is complete; whether all of the true state ments are derivable. A sentence I is derivable by a set of rules V from assumptions G (written G 1-v I) if and only if there is a proof of I from G using the rules of inference V. Geiger et al. (1990) have shown that d-separation as a rule of inference is atomic-complete for the multinomial and multivariate normal class of distributions; in this case V is simply d-separation. 3\nTheorem 1 (Atomic completeness;Geiger et al.) G FPv i if and only if G 1-v i.\nTheorem 2 (Geiger et al.) G FPN i if and only if G 1-v i.\n1 Pearl's claim is supported by the proof that for any di rected acyclic graph G there exists distribution for which G is a perfect map ( or, in the language of this paper, the distribution is faithful to G); see Theorem 10 of Pearl1988 and Geiger and Pearl1988b for a proof. However, the dis tribution which they construct is a Gaussian distribution. One of the main results of this paper is to show that for any directed acyclic graph and fixed discrete statespace there is distribution to which that graph is perfect map.\n2 Assuming that P is a probability density function then G is an I-map for P if and only if P satisfies the local directed Markov condition with respect to G ( see Lauritzen et al. 1990 and Spirtes et al. 1993).\n3The analogous results for undirected graphs is given as theorem 2.3 in Frydenberg (1990).\nThus, for any given atomic independence fact i one can use d-separation to check if the independence state ment i is entailed by the graphical structure. This does not allow us to check independence sentences which are disjunctive combination or sentences of disjunc tive and conjunctive combinations of such statements. To derive disjunctive and conjunctive combinations of independence statements the set of inferential rules V, i.e. d-separation, must be expanded to a set of in ferential rules v* which includes /\\-introduction and V-introduction.4\nTheorem 3 (Strong completeness) G FPv I if and only if G 1-v. I.\nTheorem 4 (Geiger et al., Spirtes et al.) G FPN I if and only if G 1-v. I.\nThe proofs of the strong completeness theorems are sketched in the appendix. As with any complete ness proof, if a disjunctive independence sentence AilBIC V Xl.l. YIZ is not true for a graph G one must show that there is a model - in our case a prob ability distribution - in which both AilBIC and Xl.l. YIZ are not true. Let graph G be given and as sume that it is not that case that G FPv AilBIC. Geiger et al. (1990) gave a method for constructing a distribution P for which the given graph G is an I map such A liB IC is false in P. I extend the result to show that there exists a distribution for arbitrary disjunctive combinations of non-entailed independence facts."}, {"heading": "3 ASSUMPTIONS FOR RELIABLY LEARNING BAYES NETWORKS", "text": "There are several algorithms which use independence tests to learn Bayesian networks from sample data in cluding the PC, and SGS algorithms (Spirtes et al. 1993). Basically these algorithms perform a series of statistical tests of independence using the sample data and based upon the results of these tests the al gorithms eliminate a set of possible models until the remaining set of models can not be distinguished by independence facts. The methods enumerated above differ in the series of independence test that are used; the selection and ordering of the tests can improve the practical reliability and computational tractability of these algorithms. Let Sa be any arbitrary boolean combination of independence statements about vari ables in graph G; I write S when the appropriate graph is clear from context. Interpret ..., Xil YIZ to mean that X, and Y are conditionally dependent on Z. A distribution P is faithful to the graphical structure G if and only if exactly the independence facts true in P are entailed by the graphical structure G. G faithfully entails S (written G f=?\" S) if and only if S is true\n4The analogous results for undirected graphs is given Geiger and Pearl (1988a).\nStrong completeness and faithfulness in Bayesian networks 413\nin every distribution in P which is faithful to G. It is easy to show that for all directed acyclic graphs G and for all S that G I=\ufffd S or G I=\ufffd ...,s. Using this fact one can show the theoretical reliability of these algo rithms assuming the correctness of the statistical tests and that the population distribution is faithful to the underlying graphical structure. Let testi be the result of the ith test (e.g. Xil YIZ or ...,Xil YIZ for dis joint subsets X,Y,Z of vertices).5 From the assump tion, models can be eliminated in the following way. After performing t tests one can eliminate a model G if ..., A!=l testi is faithfully entailed by G. Eliminate models until the remaining set of models are not dis tinguishable by conditional independence facts. 6\nThe assumption of faithfulness has been criticized by several researchers. The essence of the criticism is cap tured by the following question. How can one ever be confident that the population is faithful to the under lying structure?\nThis is a reasonable question but an even stronger question seems warranted. Are there faithful distri butions (in the class of distributions of interest) for any arbitrary directed acyclic graph? The theorems below demonstrate that the answer to this question is affirmative. The proof of existence for 'P.N uses an alternative proof technique as compared to the proof given in Geiger and Pearl (1988) and Spirtes et al. (1993).\nTheorem 5 (Existence) For all directed acyclic graphs G there exists a P E 'Pv which is faithful to G.\nTheorem 6 (Geiger et al., Spirtes et al.) For all directed acyclic graphs G there exists a P E P N which is faithful to G.\nBut these theorems do not answer the criticism of the unreasonableness of the assumption of faithfulness. The next theorem shows that at least in a measure theoretic sense the assumption of faithfulness is rea sonable. The distributions in 'Pv and 'P.N are paramet ric distributions. Let 1rE be the set of linearly inde pendent parameters needed to parameterize a discrete distribution for which graph G is an !-map and let \ufffd be the set of linearly independent parameters needed to parameterize a multivariate normal distribution for which graph G is an I-map.\nTheorem 7 (Measure zero) With respect to the Lebesgue measure over 1rE 1 the set of distributions\n5 As above one can define a logical calculus for faith ful derivability ( G I-:F S) using the rule of d-separation to derive both independence and dependence facts. By adding a complete set of propositional inference rules one can show that this logical calculus is strongly-complete for S sentences.\n6The class of models which are not distinguishable by conditional independence facts constitutes a Markov equiv alence class of directed acyclic graphs; see Frydenberg 1990.\nwhich are unfaithful to G is measure zero.\nTheorem 8 (Measure zero; Spirtes et al.) With respect to the Lebesgue measure over \ufffd 1 the set of distributions which are unfaithful to G is measure zero.\nThe following interpretation of these results may be helpful. Fix a directed acyclic graph G and a set of parameters; \ufffd in the case of the Gaussian distribu tion and 1rE in the case of the discrete distribution. In the case of the discrete distribution the parameters in 1r'S encode all of the possible conditional probability tables for a given directed acyclic graph G with a fixed statespace. Consider any smooth distribution over the possible parameter values.7 Given a distribution over the possible parameterization of the Bayesian network one can consider the probability of drawing a certain type of distribution. The probability of drawing an unfaithful distribution is zero. While this result has clear implications for the existence of faithful distribu tions and for the strong completeness of d-separation the implication for learning Bayesian networks is less clear; it suggests that the interesting issues about re liably inferring Bayesian networks from data (rather than a population distribution) have to do with near violations of faithfulness.\n4 FINAL REMARKS\nIn this section I will give alternative definitions of atomic- and strong completeness to further highlight the distinction between the two concepts, and conclude with a conjecture.\nA set of distributions P is atomic complete for a set of graphs g if and only if for all graphs G E g and for all disjoint sets of vertices A, B, and C there exists a distribution P E P such that G I= AilBIC if and only if AilBIC is true in P . A set of distributions P is strong complete for a set of graphs g if and only if for all graphs G E g there exists a distribution P E P such that for all disjoint sets of vertices A, B, and C it is the case that G I= AilBIC if and only if AilBIC is true in P. Thus strong completeness differs from atomic completeness in that there is single distribution in which all and only the entailed independence facts hold whereas atomic completeness only requires that some such distribution in the class exists for each non entailed independence fact.\nI conjecture that the proof techniques used for the proofs in this paper can be extended to prove anal ogous measure zero, existence of a faithful distribu tion and strong completeness results for the condi tional Gaussian class of distributions with respect to directed acyclic graphs (see Whittaker 1990).\n7The set of distribution for which the claim holds is the class consisting of all measures dominated by the Lebesgue measure.\n414 Meek\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank Clark Glymour, Thomas Richardson, Peter Spirtes and two anonymous referees for helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper.

De tailed proofs can be found in the following section. Let G be some directed acyclic graph and 1ra be the set of linearly independent parameters needed to encode any multinomial or multivariate normal distribution for which G is an I-map. As the context demands, I let 7rG represent the parameters for either a multino mial or multivariate normal distribution.\nClaim 1 The independence facts not entailed by d separation applied to directed acyclic graph G hold only for values of the parameters which satisfy non-trivial polynomial constraints.\nThe proof of this claim is in two parts. First one can show, based upon the specific parameterization (multi nomial or multivariate normal) that the constraints are polynomials in the parameters. Second I show that the constraints are non-trivial (not all value of the pa rameters satisfy the constraints). The proof of the non-triviality is similar to the main lemma used in the atomic-completeness result of Geiger et al ..\nClaim 2 For independence statement i not entailed by G and for the Lebesgue measure over the set of param eters 1r a the set of values where the independence fact i holds is Lebesgue measure zero.\nThe proof of this claim follows from the fact that the solution set to non-trivial polynomial constraints has measure zero (See Okamoto 1973).\nTheorem 7 and Theorem 8 follow from Claim 2. With respect to a given graph G, only a finite number of independence facts are not faithfully entailed. Each of these independence facts hold only for a set of param eterizations of measure zero. The union of all of these finitely many sets of parameterizations is measurable and is of Lebesgue measure zero.\nTheorem 5 and Theorem 6 follow from Theorem 7 and Theorem 8 by the following measure-theoretic argu ment. Given that the set of parameterizations in which the distribution is unfaithful are of measure zero and that there are sets of (permissible) parameterizations with positive measure then there are parameteriza tions which are faithful.\nFinally, Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 and the strong completeness for S sentences with respect to f-:F fol low from the existence of faithful distributions for the two classes of distributions and the soundness of d separation (Pearl 1988). All and only the indepen dence facts which follow from the rule of d-separation hold in the faithful distribution. Theorem 1 and Theo rem 2 are trivial consequences of Theorem 3 and The orem 4.\nStrong completeness and faithfulness in Bayesian networks 415\n6 APPENDIX B - PROOFS\nA discrete Bayesian network is a tuple ( G, P) where P is a probability density function (with respect to the counting measure) over a finite set of variables V (each of which take on at least 2 values) and G is a graph over the same set of variables V such that there exists a factorization of P(V) such that\nP(V) = IJ P(AJparents(A)) AEV\nwhere P(AJparents(A)) is a conditional probability density and parents(A) is the set of parents of vertex A in graph G. Linear Bayesian networks are described in Spirtes et al. (1993).\n6.1 Parameterizations of Bayesian networks\nGiven that the joint distribution P factors accord ing to the graph G into conditional densities one can parameterize the joint distribution by parameteriz ing each of the conditional distribution. (Only the cases where the the density is a joint density for a discrete Bayesian network and where the joint den sity is multivariate normal.) For variable A E V define NV(A) as the number of possible values that A can take and C(A) as the set of possible values of A. Let inst(0) = 1 and inst({Al, ... ,An}) = NV(Al) x . . . x NV(An). For each conditional distri bution P(AJparents(A)) one can represent the condi tional distributtion with nparam(A,parents(A)) lin early independent parameters where\nnparam(A,parents(A)) = (NV-l)xinst(parents(A)). The reason for the (NV(A) - 1) is that for any given instantiation of the parents the NV(A)th probabil ity is a linear combination of the other (NV(A) - 1) parameters. I adopt the following convention for naming the parameters. Bv,d,(al, ... ,aN) is the param eter for the conditional probability P(D = diAl = al, ... ,AN = aN) where parents( D) = Al, ... ,AN and where the variables (Al, . . . , AN) are ordered lex icographically. Let f) be the set of all of the param eters for all of the variables in V. Each of the pa rameters Bv,d,{al, ... ,aN) satisfies the constraints that 0 \ufffd Bv,d,(al, ... ,aN) \ufffd 1 and for all al, . .. , aN it is the case that :EdEC(D) Bv,d,(al, ... ,aN) = 1.8 The parame terization of linear Bayesian networks is discussed in Spirtes et al. (1993).\n6.2 Faithfulness\nLet P be a probability density function over V and G be a graph over the vertices in V. ( G, P) are said to satisfy the Markov condition if and only if for all A E V it is the case that Ail V\\(parents(A) U\n8Note that if the distribution P is not positive then some of the parameters are not strictly necessary to parameterize the distribution.\ndescendants(A)) given the parents(A). If Pis a (dis crete) probability density function, i.e. a density with respect to the counting measure, then ( G, P) is a dis crete Bayesian network if and only if ( G, P) satisfies the Markov condition. If P is a multivariate normal density function then ( G, P) is a Gaussian Bayesian network if and only if ( G, P) satisfies the Markov con dition. A conditional independence relation is entailed for graph G if and only if it is true in all distributions P such that ( G, P) satisfies the Markov condition. Let ( G, P} be a discrete (Gaussian) Bayesian network. A discrete (Gaussian) Bayesian network is faithful if and only if the conditional independence relations true in P are exactly those entailed by the factorization of P with respect to G.\n6.3 Method for constructing constraints\nIn this section I give a method for calculating the poly nomial constraint that must be satisfied for a violation of faithfulness to occur.\nLet ( G, P) satisfy the Markov condition and let AliBI C be an independence fact true in P but such that AilBJC is not implied by the Markov condition applied to G.\nAilBJC <=>\nV(a, b, c) if P(C =c) \u00a5- 0 then P(A = a,B = bJC =c) =\nP(A = aJC = c)P(B = bJC =c)<=> (*)\nV(a, b, c) if P(C =c)\u00a5- 0 then P(A = a,B = b,C = c)P(C =c) = P(A =a, C = c)P(B = b, C =c)\nThus, for a violation of faithfulness to occur a set of inst( {A, B} U C) many equations must be satis fied. Now I will show that each of these equations is a polynomial in the parameters of the model. Let 0 = Ancestor(A,B,C).\nP(O) = :Ev\\O P(V) = flxEO P(XJparents(X)) (1)\nNotice that all of the probabilities which occur in the last statement in (*) are of the form P(F=t) for some set of vertices F and some instantiations of those ver tices f. For instance if F = {A} U { B} U C then P(A=a ,B=b , C=c) is of the form P(F=t). P(F = f) = :Eo\\F P(F = f, 0\\F) (2)\n= E S(i) (3)\nwhere each summand S(i) is a product of JOJ many pa rameters (see equation 1). There are I = inst(O\\F) many summands. Let 01, . . . , OI be the I instantia tions of the variables in 0\\F. Define M(A, i) as follows M(A, i) = the value of A in the ith instantiation of 0\\F if A E 0\\F\n416 Meek\n= the value of A in the instantiation f if A E F. The ith summand S{i) for {2}, is formed in the following fashion. Let p(A, j) be the j h parent of A with respect to the lexicographic ordering over the set of parents of A.\nS(i) = II 9A,M(A,i) ,(M(p(A,l) ,i), ... ,M(p(A,n),i) AEO\nwhere A has n parents\nSince the constraints are products of terms of the form P(F=f) given in {2) the constraints are polynomials in the parameters of the discrete Bayesian network.\nViolations of faithfulness occur in the linear case for distributions only if polynomial constraints in the pa rameters of the model hold. This is shown in Spirtes et al. {1993).\n6.4 The polynomial constraints are non-trivial\nA polynomial in n variables is said to be non-trivial {not an identity) if not all instantiations of the n vari ables are solutions of the polynomial. Now I show that all of the polynomials for non-entailed independence constraints are non-trivial.\nThis is done by using the property weak transitivity which is guaranteed to hold in Gaussian and discrete distributions where all of the variables are binary (see Pearl 1988). Weak transitivity allows us to give an alternative proof of the completeness of d-separation and a measure theoretic result about faithfulness for the Gaussian case as well as the discrete case.\nSome inference rules about independence and depen dence for probability theory {see Dawid 1979 and Pearl 1988).\n-.X ilYjZ ==> -.Y ilXjZ\n-.X.llYjZ ==> -.X.llWYIZ\nFor positive distributions\n(Symmetry)\n(Decomposition)\n-.X.llWYjZ A XilWIZY ==> -.XilYIZW (Inter section)\nThe following rule also holds for Gaussian and Boolean systems -.X.ll')'IZ A -.')'.llYIZ ==> -,X.llYIZ v -,X.llYIZ'Y (Weak Transitivity)\nwhere ')' is a singleton set.\nLemma 9 (Geiger et al.) If in directed acyclic graph G there exists a d-connecting path between A and B given C then there exists a singly-connected subgraph G' of G such that A and B given C are d connected by a path p in G' and such that the only edges in G' are edges on the d-connecting path and a set of edges which form exactly one directed path from each collider on the path p to a member of C.\nProof - Let p be a d-connecting path between A\nFigure 1: Schematic of singly connected graph between A and B given C = {Cl,C2}.\nand B given C in G. Let GJ be the subgraph of G such that all of the edges on p are in G1 and for each collider D on p not in C include the edges that are on one path from D to a member of C not through another member of C. Arbitrarily choose one path if there are more than one from D to members of C.\nLet r( G1) be the number of multiple pathways that exist in G 1. It is clearly finite. If r( Gt) > 0 then there exists two distinct colliders on p, the d-connecting path from A to B given C in G1, which have the same mem ber of C as a descendent. Let D1 and D2 be such colliders. Let p(D1, D2] be the set of edges between D1 and D2 on the path p. Remove p[D1, D2] from the graph G1. Clearly r( Gt) is reduced by remov ing p[D1, D2]. Continue the process until r( G1) = 0. Clearly a d-connecting path between A and B given C remains at each stage.\nThe graph G1 is the desired graph G'.D\nSchematically, the claim amounts to the claim that there is a subgraph which looks like the graph in Fig ure 1 where C = { C1, C2}.\nLet P be a probability distribution and G be a directed acyclic graph.

Construct a binary valued (Gaussian) distribution P1 over the variables in G such that ( G, P) is a discrete Bayes network and such that -,A.llBIC is true in P1\u2022 Since AilB!C is not entailed by Markov condition applied to G there must exist a path which d-connects A and B given C. Let G' be the subgraph of G described in Lemma 9. To simplify the proof I will give an informal argument which can readily be turned into a rigorous inductive argument. Let G' be described by the graph in Fig ure 2 where C = {C1, C2}.\nLet P be a positive binary (Gaussian) probability dis tribution such that ( G' ,P} satisfies the local depen dence condition; one exists by Claim 3 (Claim 4).

Let V' be the set of vertices in G' and V be the set of vertices in G and let {Z\ufffd, Z2, \u2022\u2022 Zn} be an enumeration of the vertices in V\\ V'. In the discrete case let P(V) = Pt (V')P(Z1) . . . P(Zn) where P(Zi) is any arbitrary binary distribution over the variable Zi. In the Gaussian case let cov(Zi, X) = 0 for all 0 \ufffd i \ufffd n and X E V' and set the variances of Zi arbitrarily but not to zero. It should be clear that the proof above can be turned into an induction over the number of directed paths (or more exactly semi-treks) in the d-connecting path in G'.D\nLemma 12 (Atomic completeness;Geiger et al.) For any directed acyclic graph G over variables V which does not entail AilBIC there exists a dis crete (not necessarily binary) distribution P such that -,AllBIC is true in P and (G, P} is a discrete Bayesian network.\nProof - Begin by constructing the discrete binary distribution P from Lemma 11. Simply expand the distribution based on binary valued probabilities to one based upon the number of categories required for each of the variables in V; the resulting distribution is essentially a binary distribution extended to an ar bitrary discrete probability space by using zero proba bilities. Assume that the values of the binary variables in P are either zero or one (0 or 1). The easiest way to extend the distribution is to force the probability of V =v to be zero if for some A E B the value of A in v is not either 0 or 1. The dependence follows since all of the polynomials described in equation (*) must hold for the independence to hold and by Lemma 11 and this is not the case.D\n418 Meek\nTheorem 1 (Geiger et al.) G I==Pv i if and only if G 1--v .. i.\nProof- This follows from Lemma 12 and the sound ness of d-separation (see Pearl 1988).0 Theorem 2(Geiger et al.) G I==Px i if and only if G 1--v .. i.\nProof- This follows from Lemma 11 and the sound ness of d-separation.O\n6.5 Polynomial constraints are Lebesgue measure zero and the completeness of d-separation.\nLemma 13 (Okamoto) - The solutions to a (non trivial} polynomial are Lebesgue measure zero over the space of the parameters of the polynomial.\nFor a fixed statespace (i.e. the number of categories for each variable) let 1r'S be the set of linearly indepen dent parameters needed to parameterize an arbitrary discrete distribution for which graph G is an 1-map and let \ufffd be the set of linearly independent parameters needed to parameterize an arbitrary multivariate nor mal distribution for which graph G is an 1-map. For the discrete case, the set of legal parameterizations E \ufffd [0, 1]n where n is the number of linearly indepen dent parameters. For the Gaussian case, the set of legal parameterizations is the space nn.\nLemma 14 For a fixed statespace with n linearly in dependent parameters, the set of parameterizations w over a graph G in which independence fact A.U.BIC is true but such that A.U.BIC has measure zero with respect the Lebesgue measure over Rn.\nProof - Let n = inst({A, B} U C). There are n polynomials which must hold for this violation to oc cur. The polynomials are non-trivial by Theorem 11. Let Wi be the set of solutions to the ith polynomial.\nn w= n wi\ni=l w is measurable since finite intersections of measurable sets are measurable. Let w' = Uf=1 Wi. Since w' is the finite union of measurable sets it is measurable. p,(w) \ufffd p,(w') \ufffd :E\ufffd=l p,(wi) = 0 and given the non negativity of the measure p,(w) = 0; n is Lebesgue measure zero.O\nTheorem 7 (Measure zero) With respect to the Lebesgue measure over 1r'S , the set of distributions which are unfaithful to G is measure zero.\nProof- There are a finite number of sets of polyno mials which must be satisfied to violate faithfulness. Let n be the number of such polynomials and Wi be the set of solutions to the ith set of polynomials, each of these sets is of measure zero by Lemma 14.\nn w= Uwi\ni=l\nw is measurable since finite unions of measurable sets are measurable and the set w is also Lebesgue mea sure zero. Finally restrict the solution set w to the interval [0,1). Let E \ufffd [0, 1)n be the subset of legal parameterizations of a distribution where n is the di mensionality of the space for the Lebesgue measure, p,. E is a closed set and thus measurable. As E is a mea surable set and the finite intersection of measurable sets is again measurable, w n E is measurable. Since wnE c w it is the case that p,(wnE) \ufffd p,(w) = 0 and by the non-negativity of the measure p, it is the case that p,(w n E) = o.o Theorem 8 (Measure zero; Spirtes et al.) With respect to the Lebesgue measure over \ufffd, the set of distributions which are unfaithful to G is measure zero; i.e. Violations of faithfulness in Gaussian probability distributions are Lebesgue measure zero.\nProof- Similar to proof of Theorem 7.0 Theorem 5 For all directed acyclic graphs G there exists a P E Pv which is faithful to G.\nProof - Follows from Theorem 7 by the following measur\ufffdtheoretic argument. Given that the set of pa rameterizations in which the distribution is unfaithful are of measure zero and that there are sets of (permis sible) parameterizations with positive measure then there are parameterizations which are faithful.O\nTheorem 6 (Geiger et al. Spirtes et al.) For all directed acyclic graphs G there exists a P E P .N which is faithful to G.\nProof- Follows from Theorem 8 as in Theorem 5.0 Theorem 3 (Strong completeness) G I==Pv I if and only if G 1--v .. l;i.e. d-separation is strongly complete for the class of multinomial distributions over arbitrary directed acyclic graphs.\nProof- This follows from the existence of a faithful distribution in the multinomial class of distributions (Theorem 5) and the soundness of d-separation.O Theorem 4 (Geiger et al., Spirtes et al.) G I==Px I if and only if G 1--v .. I; i.e. d-separation is strongly complete for the class of Gaussian probability distribu tions over arbitrary directed acyclic graphs.\nProof - This follows from the existence of a faith ful distribution in the class of Gaussian distributions (Theorem 6) and the soundness of d-separation.O"}], "references": [{"title": "Probabilistic network construc\u00ad tion using the minimum description length princi\u00ad ple", "author": ["R.
