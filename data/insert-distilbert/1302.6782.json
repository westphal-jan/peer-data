First, if the mixture is ide n\u00ad tifiable - and mixtures with pdfs from the same para\u00ad metric family are identifiable in most cases - there is still an obvious problem of multimodality in equa\u00ad tion (27) due to the possibility of label switching. This problem can be overcome with constraints to avoid la\u00ad bel switching in the process of finding the minimizer for equation (24). Second, there is the concern about whether Laplace regularity holds in this case. Indeed it does hold in this case at least for a large class of pdfs that includes the exponential family as well as other important parametric families. For more details on Laplace's method in mixtures as well as proofs for the regularity conditions and some applications see Craw\u00ad ford [1994]. 3 Implementation Issues and Limitations", "startOffset": 62, "endOffset": 834}, {"referenceID": 7, "context": "In this case experience seems to be the best guide [Kass et al. 1988].", "startOffset": 51, "endOffset": 69}, {"referenceID": 6, "context": "The computational implementation of Laplace's method is relatively straightforward. It depends on the availability of the same computer routines that im\u00ad plement -cmsgical optimization procedures used by the methods of maximum likelihood and posterior mode analysis. The approximation of marginal distribu\u00ad tions usually requires numerical integration procedures - if accurate approximations for the integration con\u00ad stant or probabilities of regions of the distribution are needed - as well as plotting procedures. Typical applications of Laplace's method to the ap\u00ad proximation of moments involve the computation of two minimizers for the expressions in equations (8) and (9), one of them being usually the posterior mode. Fre\u00ad quently the second minimizer is found with only a few steps of Newton's method (1 to 3 usually) when one of the minimizers is used as the starting point for the second optimization process. Similar procedure can be used in the case of marginals, considering in these case information from previous approximations. This means that the computational effort needed to implement Laplace's method is only marginally greater than that needed for the posterior mode analysis or method of maximum likelihood. One aspect that seems critical, however, is the availability of improved computational procedures to find numerical approxi\u00ad mations to gradients and specially to Hessians if the analytical expressions are not available.
