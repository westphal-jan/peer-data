Representation of these judgements by numbers from interval L = [0, lJ or L = [0, 100] and using over these numbers quanti tative operations such as multiplication, addition and so on is not always correct. Let's consider example.\nLet R1 and R2 are two rules of some expert system:\nRl: If At then H1,pv(RI), (1) R2: If A2 then H2,pv(R2), (2)\nwhere pv(RI) and pv(R2) are the plausibility, cer tainty, truth values of rules measured in some linearly ordered scale L, for example L = [0, 1]. Often plausi bilities of conclusions are calculated by:\npv(Ht) = pv(Rl) * pv(At), (3)\npv(H2) = pv(R2) * pv(A2), (4) where pv(At) and pv(A2} are the plausibilities of premises and * is some T-norm, for example multi plication operation (Godo, Lopez de Mantaras et al. 1988; Hall1990; Trillas, Valverde 1985; Valverde, Tril las 1985; Forsyth 1984). Generally the plausibility of conclusion can be calculated by means of a modus po nens generating function mpgf:\npv(HI) = mpgf(p\u00b7v(At),pv(Rt)).\nLet in (1)-( 4) the qualitative information about plau sibility values is the next:\npv(At) < pv(A2} < pv(R2) < pv(RI), (5)\nthat is the plausibility values of premises are less than the plausibility values of rules, the plausibility value of A1 is less than the plausibility value of A2 and the plausibility value of rule R2 is less than the plausibility value of rule Rl. Let these plausibility values are inter preted as the next quantitative values from L = (0, 1]:\npv(A1) = 0.3 < pv(A2) = 0. 4 < pv(R2} = 0.6 <\n< pv(RI) = 0.9.\nIf in (3), (4) the operation * will be a multiplication operation then we will obtain from (3)-(4):\npv(H1) = 0.27 > pv(Hz) == 0.24.\nIf the plausibility values from (5) will obtain some another quantitative values preserving the qualitative relation {5), for example pv(A1) will be changed to pv(A1) = 0.2, then we will obtain the opposite order ing of conclusions:\npv(H1) = 0.18 < pv(H2) = 0.24.\nT hus the small transformations in quantitative inter pretation of judgements of experts and expert systems users which preserve the qualitative information about plausibility values can bring to opposite results on the output of expert system. T he similar situation of in stability of results on the output of inference procedure can also arise when we use another quantitative oper. ations in (3)-( 4) and such instability of decisions can arise on the each step of inference procedure.\nStability of decisions on the output of inference proce dures is achieved for uncertainties measured in ordinal scales if in (3)-( 4) we use * = A(min) operation {Zadeh\n1965). But in this case the property of strict mono tonicity of conclusions desirable for inference proce dures does not fulfiled. This property is discussed in the next section.\n56 Batyrshin\n2 STRICT MONOTONICITY OF CONCLUSIONS\nIn inference procedures we can also require the ful filment of the next property of strict monotonicity of conclusions for rules (1) - (2):\nSMC. If pv(R1) = pv(R2) > 0 and pv(At) > pv(A2)\nthen pv(Ht) > pv(H2).\nThis requirement is fulfiled for the most quantitative T-norms used in (3), (4) instead of* operation but it is not fulfiled for * = A . For example if pv(R1) = pv(R2) = 0.6 and pv(A1) = 1 > pv(A2) = 0.8 then pv(H1) = 0.6 1\\ 1 = 0.6, pv(H2 ) == 0.61\\0.8 = 0.6, i.e. pv(H1) = pv(H2) and SMC does not fulfiled.\nHere we consider one class of lexicographic valuations of plausibility (Batyrshin 1993, 1994; Batyrshin, Za kuanov 1993) whith lexicographic generalization of 1\\ operation. The operations over lexicographic valua tions of plausibility are based only on ordinal informa tion about its operands and oriented to manipulation with uncertainties measured in ordinal scale. In this class the modus ponens generating function fulfiling to the property of strict monotonicity of conclusions is introduced.\nThe concept of lexicography is widely used in combina torics, informatics and decision-making theory. Algo rithms of lexicographic sortings of strings can be find in (Aho, Hopcroft, Ullman 1976; Reingold, Nievergelt, Deo 1977), lexicographically ordered utility functions are considered in (F ishburn 1970), lexicographic order ing of criteria is considered in (Keeney, Raiffa 1976; Podinovskii, Gavrilov 1975), leximin and leximax or derings of criteria! values are considered in (Podi novskii, Gavrilov 1975; Moulin 1988; Vilkas 1990). In fuzzy theory, fuzzy and non-monotonic logic leximin and leximax orderings of the weights of the justifica tions, weights of the formulas, satisfaction degrees and maximal consistent subsets are considered in (Dubois, Lang, Prade 1990; Dubois, Lang, Prade 1992; Benfer hat, Cayrol, Dubois, Lang, Prade 1993; Fargier, Lang, Schiex 1993), leximin and leximax ordering of plausi bility, certainty values in expert systems and degrees of membership of fuzzy sets are considered in (Batyrshin 1989, 1990, 1993, 1994). The concept of weighted lex imin ordering of fuzzy criteria is considered in (Batyr shin, Zakuanov 1990, 1993)\nIn (Batyrshin 1989, 1990, 1993, 1994; Batyrshin, Za kuanov 1993 ao) a new approach to use the idea of lexicography was developed: in addition to usual lex icographic orderig of strings and lexicographic order ing of ordered strings of values the generalization of main fuzzy logic connectives over such strings was in troduced. Different types of such generalization can be developed. Below the most simplest algebra of lex icographic valuations of plausibility is considered.\n3 A-VALUATIONS OF PLAUSIBILITY\nLet L is a scale of plausibility (certainty, possibility, truth) values linearly ordered by relation ::::; (or < ). For example L == [0, 1], L = [0, 100], L = { a1 < a2 < ... < am} , where ak - some verbal or numerical grades: L = {impossible < almost impossible < slightly pos sible < average possibility < very possible < almost sure < sure},L = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, and so on. On such scales min (A) and max (V) operations are de fined by relation ::::; in the usual way:\nf 1\\ g = J, f v g = g iff ::::; g. (6) 0 and I will denote the minimal and the maximal el ements of L. The negation operation 1 also can be easily introduced by: ]1 = I-f for quantitative scales L = [0, 1] or L = [0, 100], and by: a:., = am-k+l for symmetric discrete scales.\nLet F be a set of all strings of finite length defined on L. An equality relation = for strings f(n) = ]I ... fn and g(m) = Yl . . \u00b7Ym from F where /j ,gk E L, j E J{n) = {l, .. . ,n}, k E J(m) = {1, ... ,m} is defined as:\nf(n) = g(m), if n = m and fi = 9i for all j E J(n).\nA concatenation of strings f(n),g(m) E F is a string fg = ft ... fn9I . .. 9m\u00b7 A A-string r is a string r(n) = (It ... In) such that /j ::::; /i+l for all j E J(n- 1) if n > 1 and r(n) =(It) if n = 1.\nA A \u2022 operation on F is a sorting operation such that A .. f is a A-string obtained from the string f == !1 ... f n by some permutation of its members.\nLet p\u00b7 be the set of all A-strings from F and r(n), g\"(m) (n, m;::: 1) are arbitrary A-strings from p\u00b7. An indistinguishability relation !::::! on plausibility of A-strings is defined on F \u2022 in the next way:\nr(n) !::::! g\"(m) if It ::::: 91 = 0 or if /j = 9j for all j E J(n/\\m) and fm+l =I if n > m or 9n+l =I if m >n.\nA-string is considered as the (intermediate) result of generalized conjunction operation D. used over operands ft, .. . , fn and indistinguishability relation!::::! generalizes the next identities from the fuzzy logic:\na 1\\ 0 == 0, a A 1 = a.\nA reduction operation -on F\" is an operation such that f \u00b7- will be the /\\-string with the least length which is indistinguishable with r. If r = r- then r will be called a /\\-valuation.\nWe can show (Batyrshin 1994) that indistinguishabil ity relation \ufffd on plausibility of A-strings is an equiv alence relation on F \u00b7 and A-valuations can be consid ered as representatives of equivalence classes cif this relation. We have r- !::::! j\". For A-valuations indis tinguishability relation !::::! coincides with equality re lation =. For these reasons we will replace A-strings\nr by /\\-valuations r- and below will consider only A-valuations. Below r will denote /\\-valuation and p\u00b7 will denote the set of all /\\-valuations on L. An ordering relation :::; on plausibility of /\\ valuations is defined on p- in the next way:\nr(n):::; g\"(m) if n \ufffd m and fi = 9j for all j E J(m) or if there exist j E J( n t\\ m) such that /j < 9i and /k = 9k for all k <j. This ordering relation can be considered as generaliza tion of the usual lexicographic ordering relation and the next relation from the fuzzy logic:\nat\\ b:::; a.\nThe defined relation :::; will be a linear ordering relation on F\"(Batyrshin 1994) and this relation defines on p\u00b7 by (6) min (/\\)and max {V) operations. The elements:\no\u00b7 = (o), r == (I), will be accordingly the minimal and the maximal elements of F \u2022.\nGeneralizations of conjunction 6 and disjunction 'V operations on F \u2022 are defined in the next way (Batyrshin, Zakuanov 1993, Batyrshin 1993):\nr e.g\u00b7= (t\\*(ru\u00b7)r,\nr v g\u00b7 = r v g\u00b7.\nTHEOREM 1 (Batyrshin, Zakuanov 1993, Batyrshin 1994). 6 is aT-norm and \\lis a T-conorm on F' that is they are commutative, associative, non-decreasing in each argument and fulfil to the properties:\nrt::..r=r,\nr vo\u00b7 = r,\nr6o\u00b7=o\u00b7,\nr'Vr=r, r 6 g\" < r if r > o\u00b7, g\u00b7 < r,\nand D. is strict monotonic on F':\n(7)\n(8) (9)\nif r < g' and o\u00b7 < h\" then r D.h\" < g' 6h'. (10)\n4 NEGATION OPERATION ON p\u00b7\nLet 1 : L \ufffd L is a negation operation on L that is for all f from L holds (Weber 1983; Trillas, Alsina, Valverde 1982): f' :::; g' if g :5 f; 01 = I, I' = 0. 1 is a weak negation on L if !\" \ufffd f, and 1 is an involution on L if f\" = f. A function c : F\" - F' will be called a negation operation on p\u00b7 iff on F' holds:\nc(O\")=r, c(r)=O\u00b7,\nc(/\"):::; c(g') if g' :::; r' c(f \" (n)) = (fi) if n = 1.\nTHEOREM 2 (Batyrshin, Zakuanov 1993; Batyrshin 1994). The function c: p\u00b7 - F\" defined by: c(r) =\nModus Ponens for A-Valuations of Plausibility 57\nUn is a negation operation on F. and fulfils to the properties:\nc(r D.g') = c(r)vc(g\"),\nc(r \\l g\") \ufffd c(F) 6 c(g\"). If 1 is a weak negation on L then c is a weak negation on F', and if 1 is an involution on L then c fulfils to:\nc(c(c(r))) = c(r).\n5 MODUS PONENS GENERATING FUNCTIONS ON p\u00b7\nOn F\" we can also generalize the concepts of S- and R-im plication and for each of them the modus ponens generating functions mpgfS and mpgfR (Go do, Lopez de Mantaras et al. 1988; Hall 1990; TI:illas, Valverde 1985; Valverde, Trillas 1985).\nDEFINITION 1. A S-irnplication - >: F' x F\" -+ F\", a modus ponens generating function mpgfS: F' X p\u00b7 -+ p\u00b7, a R-implication =>: p\u00b7 x p\u00b7 - F\" and a modus ponens generating function mpgfR: F' x p\u00b7 - F\" are defined on p\u00b7 in the next way:\nr- > g\u00b7 = c(F) v g\u00b7,\nmpgfS(,-,g\u00b7) = inf{h\" E F'ir- > h\" \ufffd g'},\nr => g\u00b7 = sup{h' E p\u00b71r b,. h':::; g'},\nmpgfR(r,g\u00b7) = r D.g'.\nTHEOREM 3. For m= mpgfR the next properties hold:\nm(r,r)=r, m(O',g\")=o\u00b7, ( 11)\nif r < h' and o\u00b7 < g' then m(r ,g') < m(h\" ,g\u00b7), (12)\nif g\" < h\" and o\u00b7 < r then m(r,g\u00b7) < m(f',h'), (13)\nm(f',F) < r if r < r, (14)\nm(j\",g') < min{f\",g'}, ifO' < j\",g\u00b7 < r, (15)\nm(r,g\u00b7) > 0' if r,g\u00b7 > o\u00b7. (16)\nPROOF. (11) follows from (7). (12)-(13) follow from (10). (14)-(15) follow from (9). (16) follows from (10), (7).\nThe properties (11)-(16) are based on properties of modus ponens generating functions discussed in (Hall 1990; Trillas, ValYerde 1985; Valverde, Trillas 1985). We note here that (12) coincides with requirement of strict mouotonicity of conclusions SMC and for m= rnpgfS only properties (11) and non-strict monotonic ity in (12)-(13) are fulfiled.\n58 Batyrshin"}, {"heading": "6 EXAMPLE AND APPLICATIONS", "text": "Let expert system in medicine contains the rule: If HEMATURJA-INTENSITY = MACROHEMATURJA and CLOT-OF-BLOOD= YES and CLOT-FORM= FORMLESS then HYPOTHESIS= UROLITHIASIS, pv= LARGE and HYPOTHESIS= TUMOR-OF-KIDNEY, pv= VERY LARGE, where plausibility values of rules, premises and facts are measured in linearly ordered scale with grades: {MINIMAL, VERY-SMALL, SMALL, AVERAGE, LARGE, VERY-LARGE, MAXIMAL }. And let the plausibility values of premises obtain the next values: pv(HEMATURJA-INTENSITY = MACROHEMATURJA) = MAXIMAL, pv(CLOT-OF-BLOOD= YES) = VERY-LARGE, pv(CLOT-FORM= FORMLESS) = LARGE. Then the conclusions will obtain the next plausibility values: pv (HYPOTHESIS= UROLITHIASIS)= (LARGE, LARGE, VERY-LARGE), pv(HYPOTHESIS= TUMOR-OF-KIDNEY)= (LARGE, VERY-LARGE, VERY-LARGE) .\nLexicographic comparison of plausibility values of hypotheses gives (HYPOTHESIS = TUMOR-OF KIDNEY) as more plausible hypothesis while if we use only 1\\ (min) operation in conjunction and in modus ponens generating function then both hypotheses will obtain the same value LARGE.\nAn interpretation of /\\-valuations of plausibility ob tained on the output of expert system is very simple and gives an additional information about the number of plausible premises used in inference procedure and about plausibility values of these premises.\nSome types of algebras of lexicographic valuations of plausibility are realized in expert systems shell LEX ICO developed in expert systems laboratory of Kazan State Technological University. On the base of LEX ICO different expert systems are constructed. For ex ample hybrid expert system based on simulation model of chemical reactor was also created.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author is thankful to the referees for suggestions towards the improvement of the paper.\nReferences\nA.

The class of A-valuations of plausibility is considered where operations based only on information about linear or\u00ad dering of plausibility values are used. In this class the modus ponens generating function fulfiling to the property of strict monotonic\u00ad ity of conclusions is introduced. 1 STABILITY OF DECISIONS IN INFERENCE PROCEDURES Human judgements about plausibility, truth, certainty values of premises, rules and facts are usually qualita\u00ad tive and measured in ordinal scales. Representation of these judgements by numbers from interval L = [0, lJ or L = [0, 100] and using over these numbers quanti\u00ad tative operations such as multiplication, addition and so on is not always correct. Let's consider example. Let R1 and R2 are two rules of some expert system: Rl: If At then H1,pv(RI), (1) R2: If A2 then H2,pv(R2), (2) where pv(RI) and pv(R2) are the plausibility, cer\u00ad tainty, truth values of rules measured in some linearly ordered scale L, for example L = [0, 1]. Often plausi\u00ad bilities of conclusions are calculated by: pv(Ht) = pv(Rl) * pv(At), (3) pv(H2) = pv(R2) * pv(A2), (4) where pv(At) and pv(A2} are the plausibilities of premises and * is some T-norm, for example multi\u00ad plication operation (Godo, Lopez de Mantaras et al. 1988; Hall1990; Trillas, Valverde 1985; Valverde, Tril\u00ad las 1985; Forsyth 1984). Generally the plausibility of conclusion can be calculated by means of a modus po\u00ad nens generating function mpgf: pv(HI) = mpgf(p\u00b7v(At),pv(Rt)). Let in (1)-( 4) the qualitative information about plau\u00ad sibility values is the next: pv(At) < pv(A2} < pv(R2) < pv(RI), (5) that is the plausibility values of premises are less than the plausibility values of rules, the plausibility value of A1 is less than the plausibility value of A2 and the plausibility value of rule R2 is less than the plausibility value of rule Rl. Let these plausibility values are inter\u00ad preted as the next quantitative values from L = (0, 1]: pv(A1) = 0.3 < pv(A2) = 0. 4 < pv(R2} = 0.6 <", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
