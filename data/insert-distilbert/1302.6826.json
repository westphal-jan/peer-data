Most previous works have only considered the refinement of the net\u00ad work's conditional probability parameters, and have not addressed the issue of refin\u00ad ing the network's structure. We develop a new approach for refining the network's structure. Our approach is based on the Minimal Description Length (MDL) princi\u00ad ple, and it employs an adapted version of a Bayesian network learning algorithm de\u00ad veloped in our previous work. One of the adaptations required is to modify the previ\u00ad ous algorithm to account for the structure of the existent network. The learning algo\u00ad rithm generates a partial network structure which can then be used to improve the exis\u00ad tent network. We also present experimental evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
