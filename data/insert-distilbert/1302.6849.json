To solve this problem, we must reject some fundamental postulates of the the ory. We introduce a new approach for uncertainty management that shares many intuitive ideas with D-S theory, while avoiding this problem.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nEvidence theory, or Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory, was de veloped as an attempt to generalize probability theory by introducing a rule for combining distinct bodies ofevidence [Dempster 1967, Shafer 1976].\nAs a formal system, D-S theory is distinguished from other uncertainty management approaches by [Dempster 1967, Shafer 1976]:\nl. A basic probability assignment, m(z), defined on the space of the subsets of competing hypotheses, rather than directly on the hypotheses themselves. m( z) in turn defines the degree of belief, Bel( A), and the degree of plausibility, Pl(A), of a set of hypotheses A. Bel( z) is a generalization of a probability function q(z).\n2. Dempster's rule of combination, applied to calculate mtffimz(z) from m1 (z) and mz(z), where mt(z) and mz(z) are based on evidence from distinct sources, and m1 ffimz ( z) is based on the pooled evidence.\nIn this paper, we argue that there is an inconsistency among the fundamental postulates of D-S theory. Though there are several possible solutions of this problem within the frame work of O-S theory, each of them has serious disadvantages. Finally, we briefly introduce a new approach that achieves the goals of D-S theory, yet is still natural and consistent.\n2 A SIM PLIFIED SITUATION\nTo simplify our discussion, we address only the simplest non-trivial frame of discernment 9 = {H, H'} (191 = 1 is trivial). Since e is exhaustive and exclusive by definition, we have H' == ii (the negation of H). In such a situa tion, the basic probability assignment m : 29 __. [0, 1] is constrained by\nm(0):::::: 0, m({H}) + m({H}) + m(9):::::: 1.\nLike m, the definitions of Bel and P l are also simplified when 191 = 2. With this simplification, we have\nBel(0) = 0, Pl(0) = 0, Bel({H}) = m({H}), Pl({H}) = 1-m({H}), Bel({H}) = m({H}), Pl({H}) = 1-m({H}), Bel(6) = 1, Pl(9) = 1.\nAs a result, all the information in these functions can be represented by an (ordered) pair\n<Bel({H}), Pl({H})>\nwhich indicates the relationship between the hypothesis H and the available evidence.\nDempster's rule in this case becomes mtEElm2({H}) = >.[m!{{H})mz({H})\n+ mt({H})mz(S) + mt(6)mz({H})]\nm1 EElmz( {ii}) >.[m1 ( {ii} )mz( {ii}) + m1({H})mz(6) + mt(6)7n2({H})]\nm1 EElffl2(9) = >.[m1 (9)mz(6)] (1) where >. = [1-mt({H})mz({H})- mt({ii})mz({H})]-1. When m( { H}) or m( { H}) is equal to 0, there is a special case ofbelief functions: a simple support function, in which the evidence points precisely and unambiguously to a single non-empty subset of 9 [Shafer 1976, page 75]. In this situation, the degree of support for {H} (or {H}). \u2022\u00b7 is complete} y determined by the weight, w, of the evidence.\nWhat is weight of evidence? Though Shafer does not give a general method for practically evaluating it, he attaches the following properties to it [Shafer 1976, pages 7, 88]:\n1. w is a measurement defined on bodies of evidence, and it takes values on [0, oo].\n2. When two entirely distinct bodies of evidence are com bined, the weight of the pooled evidence is the sum of the original ones.\nWhen the simple support functions to be combined each provide positive evidence for H, we have\nm,({H}) = ., , m1(6) = 1- .,, 1n2({H}) = -'2, m,(e) = 1- -'2\u00b7\nThen Dempster's rule gives\nm,El)mz({l!}) = 1- (1- -'1)(1- -'2) m1 ffim2({H}) = 0 m1 EBm2(6) = (1- -'1)(1 - -'2) ,\nwhich is the same as Bernoulli's rule of combination [Shafer 1976, page 76].\nFollowing the postulates that weights of evidence combine additively and that Dempster's rule (and its special case, Bernoulli's rule) is the correct way to combine them, the function g, which maps weight of evidence to degree of support, is determined by\ng(w1 + wz) = 1- (1- g(wl))(1- g(wz)).\nThe result is [Shafer 1976, page 78]:\ng(w) = 1- e-w. (2)\nThis relationship between weight of evidence and degree of support can be extended to the situation where the two pieces of evidence to be combined are in conflict. That is, one of them supports H, whereas the other supports ii. Concretely, they are\nm1({H}) = \u20221, m1(6) = 1- -'1, m2({ii}) = -'2\u2022 mt(6) = 1- -'2\u00b7\nThen Dempster's rule gives\nm1EElm2({H}) m, EElmz ( {ii}) m1EElmz(6)\nIf we rewrite the result of the combination of conflicting evidence in terms of weights of evidence, and use w+ and w- to indicate the weight of positive and negative evidence for H, respectively (their sum is the total weight of evidence, w), we get a generalization of (2) [Shafer 1976, page 84]:\nBel({H}) ew+ - 1\ne\"\"+ + e\"\"- - 1 w+\nPl({H}) e\n(3) ew+ + ew- - 1\nOn the other hand, we can determine w+ and w- from Bel({H}) and Pl({H}) when Bel({H}) < Pl({H}), and get [Shafer 1976, page 84]\n+ l Pl({H})\nw og Pl({H})- Bel({H})\nl 1- Bel({H}) w og\nPl({H})-Bel({H}) (4)\nThe concept of \"evidence combination\" can be fonnulated as\n(5)\nwhere wt and wi, as well as w} and w2, come from distinct sources, and w+ (w-) is the weight of the pooled positive (negative) evidence (for H).\nGiven (3), (4), and (5), we can derive the combination rule in terms of Bel( {H}) and Pl({H}). To simplify the formula, letbstand for Bel{{H}),andpfor Pl({H}). Thus,\nb\np\nb1P2 + bzPl - b1 bz 1- b,(1- pz)- bz(1- Pt) P1P2 1 -b1(1 - pz) - bz(1 -pl) I\nwhich is exactly Dempster's rule when ]6] = 2.\n(6)\nThe above inferences show that when \"evidence combina tion\" is understood as (5), the combination rule(in thefonns of ( 1) or ( 6)) and the functions that relate belief functions to weights of evidence (in the forms of (3) or (4)) are mutually determined.\nGenerally, we have Bel( { H}) + Bel( { ii}) :S: 1. When m(E>) is 0, or Bel({H}) :::: Pl({H}), it is a special case, where Bel( { H}) + Bel( { ii}) = 1. From (3), it is clear that this happens if and only if w goes to infinite. In [Dempster 1967], Dempster calls such a belief function \"sharp,\" and treats it as \"an ordinary probability measure.\" In [Shafer 1976], Shafer calls it \"Bayesian;' and writes it as Bel00({H}). Shafer also refers to Bel00({H}) as the chance, or aleatory probability, of H [Shafer 1976, pages 16, 33, 201]. 1\n3 A PROBLEM\nFrom the above descriptions, D-S theory seems to be a reasonable extension of probability theory because it intro duces a combination rule, and still converges to probability theory when Bel( {H}) and Pl( {H}) overlap.\nTo see clearly how D-S theory and probability theory are related to each other, consider the situation where evidence for H is in the form of a sequence of experiment outcomes with the following properties:\n1. No single outcome can completely confirm or refute H.\n1 In this paper, probability is always used to indicate what Shafer calls chance or aleatory probability.\n2. There are only two possible outcomes: one supports H, while the other supports if.\n3. The outcomes are independent and provide distinct bodies of evidence.\nIn the following, t represents the number of available out comes, and t+ is the number of outcomes that support H. Obviously, t \ufffd t+ \ufffd 0. There are four fundamental assertions in D-S theory that are occepted as postulates:\nAssertion 1. q(H) = limt_,QO ': : the chance of His the limit of the proportion of positive outcomes among all outcomes [Shafer 1976, pages 9, 202].\nAssertion l. BeZOC)({H}) = q(H): the chance of H is adopted as degree of belief [Shafer 1976, pages 16, 201].\nAssertion 3. w+ = wt + w[ and w = wr + W2: evidence combination corresponds to the addition of the weights of evidence from distinct sources (Shafer 1976, pages 8, 77].\nAssertion 4. Dempster's rule is the correct rule for evidence combination [Shafer 1976, pages 6, 57].\nThough the four assertions are reasonable when taken indi vidually, they are inconsistent collectively. To show this, let us first study the relationship between chance and weight of evidence.\nBecause there are only two types of evidence, we can as sign two positive real numbers wt and w0 as weights of evidence to an outcome supporting H and if, respectively. After t outcomes are observed, the weight of available pos itive, negative and total evidence (for H) can be calculated according to Assertion 3:\nw+ = w+t+ 0 ' w- = w0(t-t+), w = w+ +w-.\nWhen t goes to infinity so does w, and vice versa. If t: converges to a limit q, then according to Assertion I and Assertion 2, Bel( { H}) and Pl( { H}) should also converge to q, to become BelQO ( {H} ). We can rewrite w+ and w- as functions of t and t+ in the relationships between belief function and weight of evi dence (3), which is derived from Assertion 3 and Assertion 4. If we then take the limit of the equation when t (as well as w) goes to infinity, we get\nB l ({H}) lim ... + -1 e OC) = VI->ClO ... + + \u2022'\"- -1\n= 0.5 ifwtq = w0(1- q) { 0 ifwtq < w0(1- q)\n1 if wt q > w0 (1 -:.9)\u00b7\nThis means\ufffdifq (the chance of H defined by Assertion 1) exists, then, by repeatedly applying Dempster's rule to com bine the coming evidence, both Bel({H}) and Pl({H})\nwill converge to a point. However, that point is not q in most cases, but 0, 0.5, or 1, indicating qualitatively whether there is more positive evidence than negative evidence. This result contradicts Assertion 2.\nWhat does a Bayesian belief function correspond to when BelQO({H}) is not in {0, 0.5, 1}? Shafer makes it clear that this happens when w- - w+ has a constant limit A [Shafer 1976, page 197]. In that case,\nBelQO ( { H})\nIn the current example, this happens when\nlim [w0 (t- t+) - wtt+] = A. t->co\nTherefore, though a Bayesian belief function is indeed a probability function in the sense that\nBel({H}) + Bel({H}) = 1,\nit is usually different from the chance of H. Bel00 ( { H}) and q(H) are equal only when\n1. q(H) is 0 or 1, or\n2. q(H) is 0.5, and wt = w0.\nThis inconsistency is derived from the four assertions alone, so it is independent from other controversial issues about D-S theory: such as the interpretation of belief function; the accurate definition of \"distinct\" or \"independent\" bod ies of evidence; and the actual measurement of weight of evidence. No matter what opinions are accepted on these issues, as long as they are held consistently, the previous problem remains. For example, the choice of wt and w0 can only determine which chance value is mapped to the degree of belief 0.5 (so all the other values are mapped to 0 or 1 correspondingly), but cannot change the result that chance and Bayesian belief function are usually different. This discrepancy also unearths some other inconsistencies in D-S theory. For example, Shafer describes chance as \"es sentially hypothetical rather than empirical,\" and unreach able by collecting (finite) evidence [Shafer 1976, page 202]. According to this interpretation, combining the evidence of two different Bayesian belief functions becomes invalid or nonsense, because they are chances and therefore not sup ported by finite empirical evidence. If Belco1 ( { H}) and Belco2 ( { H}) are different, then they are two conflicting conventions, and applying Dempster's rule to them is un justified. If Belco1 ( {H}) and Belt102( {H}) are equal, then they are the same convention made from different consider ations. In D-S theory, however, they are combined to get a different Bayesian belief function, unless they happen to be 0, 0.5, or 1. Such a result is counter-intuitive [Wilson 1992] and inconsistent with Shafer's interpretation of chance.\nThere are already many papers on the justification of Dempster's rule [Kyburg 1987, Pearl 1988, Smets 1990, Dubois and Prade 1991, Yoorbraak 1991, Wilson 1993],\nbut few of them addresses the relationships among degree of belief, weight of evidence, and probability. Actually weight of evidence is seldom mentioned in the litelal:ure of D-S theory. It is possible to describe and justify D-S theory as a mathematical model without mentioning the relationships. Shafer, in his later papers (for example, [Shafer and Tversky 1985, Shafer 1990]), tends to relate belief functions to reliability of testimony and randomly coded message, rather than to weight of evidence. Even so, the problem is a/wqys there, because it can be derived from the four fundamental assertions, none of which has been explicitly rejected.\n4 POSSffiLE SOLUTIONS\nTo get a consistent theory, at least one of the four assertions must be removed. In the following, let us check all four logical possibilities one by one.\nIt seems unpopular to reject Assertion 1, and redefine prob +\nability as lim,.,_ oo t w -I 1 , though this will lead to a &\"' +cw - consistent theory. The reason is simple: to use \"probability\" for the limit of the proportion of positive evidence is a well accepted convention, and a different usage of the concept will cause many confusions.\nHow about Assertion 3? In the following, we can see that if the addition of weight of evidence, during the combination of evidence from distinct sources, is replaced by multipli cation, we can also get a consistent theory.\nLet us assume w+ = wtwt and w- = w1w2 when two Bayesian belief functions Bel00 1 ( { H}) and Bel002 ( { H}) are combined. To simplify the notation, the two functions are written as b1 and b2 in the following. Now, if we simply use the number of outcomes as weight of evidence, then from Assertion 1, Assertion 2, and the new assumption, we get\nThe last equation is a special case of (6), when b1 = P1 and b2 = P2 (for Bayesian belief functions). Though we preserve consistency, the result is not intuitively appealing. For example, no matter how the weight of evi dence is actually measured, the combination of two pieces of positive evidence with unit weight (wt = wt = 1) will get w+ = 1. That is, evidence is no longer accumu lated by combination (w+ may even be less than wt, if wi < 1). This is not what we have in mind when talking about evidence combination or pooling.\nThe rejection of Assertion 2 seems more plausible than the previous alternatives. Very few authors actually use Bel00 ( { H}) to represent the probability of H. Even in Shafer's classic book [Shafer 1976], in which Assertion 2\nwas made or assumed at several places, Beloo ( z) is not directly applied to represent statistical evidence. However, there is not a consensus in the \"Uncertainty in AI\" community that Bel00(z) and q(z) are different. The following phenomena shows this:\n1. The \"lower-upper bounds of probability\" interpreta tion for belief functions is still accepted by some au\u00b7 thors [Fagin and Halpern 1991].\n2. Some other authors, including Shafer himself, reject the above interpretation, but they still refer to a prob ability function as a special type (a limit) of a belief function [Shafer 1990].\n3. Though some authors have gone so far to the conclu sion that Bayesian belief functions do not generally correspond to Bayesian measures of belief, they still view a belief function as the lower bound of probability [Wilson 1992].\nEven if everyone agrees that B el00 ( z) and q ( z) are differ ent measurements of uncertainty and that all relationships between probability theory and D-S theory are cancelled, as Smets outlines in the transferable belief model of D-S theory [Smets 1990, Smets 1991], there are still problems with this model.\nWe have shown that, following Assertion 1, Assertion 3, and Assertion 4, q(H) not only is different from Bel00({H}), but also cannot be properly represented in a belief func tion or a basic probability assignment. The proportion of positive evidence of H can be derived from Bel( { H}) and Pl({H}), when Bel({H}) < Pl({H}), as\nw+ logp -log(p-b) -;; = logp + log(1- b)- 2 log(p-b)\nwhere b is Bel( { H}) and pis Pl( {H} ) . Still, the relation ship is not natural, and the ratio usually does not converge to the same point with Bel( {H}) and Pl({H}). As a re sult, a natural way to represent uncertainty as proportion of positive evidence becomes less available in D-S theory. As shown before, Bel( { H}) is more sensitive to the difference of w+ and w-. than to the proportion ww+. q( z ), as the limit of the proportion, even cannot be represented. The knowledge \"q(H) = 0.51\" and \"q(H) = 0.99\" will both be represented as Bel\ufffd{H}) = Pl({H}) = 1. and their difference will be lost.\nIf Assertion 2 were rejected, it would be invalid to interpret Bel( {H}) and Pl( { H}) as \"lower and upper probability\" [Dempster 1967, Smets 1991, Fagin and Halpern 1991, Dubois and Prade 1992]. It is true that there are probability functions P( z) satisfying\nBel({z}) \ufffd P(z) \ufffd Pl({z}), for all z E 9.\nHowever, as demonstrated above, these functions may be unrelated to q(H).\n2Here we do not distinguish \",.+ and *: , because their differ ence does not influence the conclusion, as shown previously.\nFor the same reason, the assertion that \"the Bayesian theory is a limiting case of D-S theory\" [Shafer 1976, page 32] may be misleading. From a mathematical point of view, this assertion is true. since Bel00 ( { H}) is a probability function. But as discussed previously, it is not the proba bility of H. Therefore, it is not valid to get inference rules for D-S theory by extending Bayes theorem. In general, the relationship between D-S theory and probability theory will be very loose.\nIt is still possible to put different possible probability dis tributions into e and to assign belief function to them, as Shafer did [Shafer 1976, Shafer 1982]. For example, the knowledge \"q(H) = 0.51\" can be represented as \"Bel({q(H) = 0.51}) = 1.\" However, here the proba bility function is evaluated by the belief function, rather than being a special case of it. The two are at different levels. As a result, the initial idea of D-S theory (to gener alize probability theory), no longer holds. From a practical point of view, this approach is not appealing, neither. For instance, for any evidence combination to occur there must be finite possible probabilities for H at the very beginning. It is unclear how to get them.\nFinally, it is unlikely, though not completely impossible, to save D-S theory by rejecting Assertion 4. We can say that Dempster's rule does not apply to evidence combination, but can be used for some other purposes. Even so, the initial goal of D-S theory will be missed.\nIn summary, though it is possible for D-S theory to survive the inconsistency by removing one of the assertions, the result is still unsatisfactory. Either the natural meaning of ''probability\" or \"evidence combination\" must be changed, or the theory will fail to meet its original purpose, that is, to extend probability theory by introdudng an evidence combination rule.\n5 AN ALTERN ATIVE APPROACH\nIn spite of the problems, some intuitions behind D-S theory are still attractive, such as the first three assertions, the idea of lower-upper probabilities [Dempster 1967], and the dis tinction between disbelief and lack of belief [Shafer 1976].\nFrom previous discussion, we have seen that the core of evidence combination is the relationships among degree of belief, probability, and weight of evidence. The combina tion rule can be derived from the relationships.\nLet us continue with \u00b7the previous example. Because all the measurements are about H, we will omit it to simplify the formulas. Following the practice of statistics, for the current example a very natural convention is to use the number of outcomes as the weight of evidence: wt = w0 = 1.\nBecause our belief about H is totally determined by avail able evidence, it may be uncertain due to the existence of negative evidence. To measure the relative support that H gets from available evidence, the most often used method is to take the frequency of positive evidence: f = VI+ \u2022 Ac cording to Assertion 1, lim,.,-+oo f = q, that is, the limit of\nf, if it exists, is the probability of H. Therefore, we can refer to frequency as probability generalized to the situation of finite evidence.\nHowever, when evidence combination is considered, f alone cannot capture the uncertainty about H. When new evidence is combined with previous evidence, f must be reevaluated. If we only know its previous value, we cannot determine how much it should be changed - the absolute amount of evidence is absent in f. Can we capture this kind of information without recording w and w+ directly? 3\nYes, we can. From the viewpoint of evidence combination, the influence of w appears in the stability of a frequence evaluation based on it. Let us compare two situations: in the first, w = 1000 and w+ = 600, and in the other w = 10 and w+ = 6. Though in both cases f is 0.6, the stability is quite different. After a new outcome is observed, in the first situation the new frequency becomes either \ufffd or 601 h\"l 0 th d 0 \u2022 6 7 Th ad' t . 1001, w 1 em e secon 1t ts IT or IT\u00b7 e \ufffdustmen ts much larger in the second situatlon than in the first.\nIf the information about stability is necessary for evidence combination, why not directly use intervals like [ 1\ufffd 1 fa:h] and [ /i 1 fr] to represent the uncertainty in the previous situatlons?\nGenerally, let us introduce a pair of new measurements: a lower frequency, l, and a upper frequency, u, which are defined as\nw+ w+ 1 w+ + 1 (7) u = w+ 1 \u00b7\nThe idea behind l and u is simple: if the current frequency is VI+, then, after combining the current evidence (whose weight is w) with the new evidence provided by a new outcome (whose weight is 1), the new frequency will be in the interval [11 u] . 4\nAs bounds of frequency, land ushare intuitions with Demp ster's P. and p\u2022, as well as Shafer's Bel and Pl. However, they have some properties that distance them from the func tions of D-S theory and other similar ideas like lower and upper bounds of probability:\n1. l \ufffd f \ufffd u, that is, the current frequency is within the [l1 u] interval. Furthermore, it is easy to see that f = I-\ufffd+l' so the frequency value can be easily retrieved from the bounds.\n3Though it is possible, in theory, to directly use w and w + as measurements of uncertainty, it is often unnatural and inconve nient. See [Wang 1993b] for more discussions.\n4We use an interval instead of a pair of points because the measurements will be extended to situations in which the weights of evidence are not necessarily integers. In general, the interval bounds the frequence until the weight of new evidence reaches a constant unit For the current purpose, the 1 that appears in the definitions of l and u can be substituted by any positive number. 1 is used here to simplify the discussion. See [Wang 1993b].\n2. The bounds of frequency are defined in tenns of avail able evidence, which is finite. Whether the frequence of positive evidence really has a limit does not mat ter. On the other hand, the interval can be detennined before the next outcome occurs.\n3 . lim,.,-+co l == limw -oo I = lim,.,_00 U = q. If I does have a limit q, then q is also the limit of land u. Therefore, probability is a special case of the [l, u] interval, in which the interval degenerates into a point.\n4. However, q, if it exists, is not necessarily in the inter val all the time that evidence is accumulating. [l, u] indicates the range 1 will be from the current time to a near future (until the weight of new evidence reaches a constant), not an infinite future. Therefore, l and u are not bounds of probability.\n5. The width of the interval i == u -l = w\ufffdt monoton ically decreases during the accumulating of evidence, and so can be used to represent the system's \"degree of ignorance\" (about f). When w = 0, i = 1, because with no evidence, ignorance reaches its maximum. When w--+ oo, i = 0, because with infinite evidence the probability is obtained, so the ignorance (about the frequency) reaches its minimum, even though the next outcome is still uncertain. In this way, \"lack of belief' and \"disbelief' are clearly distinguished.\nFrom the definitions of the lower-upper frequencies and As sertion 3, a combination rule, from [lt, ut] x [h, u2] to [l, u], is uniquely determined in tenns of lower-upper frequencies, when neither it = u1 - lt nor i2 = u2 - 12 is 0:\n=\nu\nlJi2 +hi! il + i2- iJi2 lti2 +hi;+ iti2\niJ + i2- iti2 (8)\nFrom (3) and (7), we can even set up a one-to-one map ping between the Bel-Pl scale and the l-u scale, when the weight of evidence w is finite and 181 = 2. In this way, the combination rule given by (8) is mapped exactly onto Dempster's rule (6) .. From a mathematical point of view, the two approaches differ only when w --+ oo. Then Bel and Pl converge to a non-trivial (not in {0, 0.5, 1}) prob ability if and only if w- - w+ converges to a constant, but l and u converge to a non-trivial probability if and only if \"'+ converges to a constant. The latter, being the probability \ufffdf H, is more helpful and important in most situations than the fonner is. In fact, Shafer acknowledges the problem when he writes, \"It is difficult to imagine a belief function such as B el00 being useful for the representation of actual evidence [Shafer 1976, page 199].\" \u00b7 However, the result seems to be accepted without further analysis, since it follows from Dempster's rule.\nLet us apply the paradigm to infinite evidence. For prac tical purpose it is impossible for a system to get infinite evidence, but we can use this concept to put definitions and conventions into a system. Beliefs supported by infinite evidence can be processed as normal ones, but will not be changed through evidence combinations.\nA Defect in Dempster-Shafer Theory 565\nAccording to the interpretation of the [Z, u] interval, it is not difficult to extend the new combination rule (8) to the case of infinite evidence:\n1. When i1 = 0 but i2 > 0, the rule is still applicable in the fonn of (8), which gives the result that l = 11 = u1 = u. Thus when uncertainty is represented by probability (a point, instead of an interval), it will not be effected by combining its evidence with finite new evidence.\n2. When i1 = i2 = 0, the rule cannot be used. Now the system will distinguish two cases:\n(a) when l1 = 12 = u1 = u2 there are two identical probabilistic judgments, so one of them can be removed (because it is redundant), leaving the other \ufffd the conclusion; or,\n(b) lt -:f. h. meaning there are two conflicting proba bilistic judgments. Since such judgments are not generated from evidence collection but from con ventions or definitions, the two judgments are not \"combined,\" but reported to the human/program which is responsible for making the conventions.\nHere we are even more faithful to Shafer's interpretation of (aleatory) probability than D-S theory is. Being \"essen tially hypothetical rather than empirical;' probability cannot be evaluated with less than infinite evidence [Shafer 1976, page 20 1]. For the same reason, it should not be changed by less than infinite evidence.\nIn summary, though many of the intuitive ideas of D-S theory are preserved, the problem in D-S theory discussed above no longer exists in the \"lower\ufffdupper frequency\" ap proach. The new method can represent probability and ignorance, and has a rule for evidence combination. The new approach can hardly be referred to as a modification or extension ofD-S theory, in part because Dempster's rule is not used.\nThis approach is used in the Non-Axiomatic Reason ing System (NARS) project. As an intelligent reason ing system, NARS can adapt to its environment and an swer questions with insufficient knowledge and resources [Wang 1993a, Wang 1993b]. A complete comparison of NARS and D-S theory is beyond the scope of this paper. By introducing the approach here, I hope to show that the most promising solution for the previous inconsistency is to choose a new rule for evidence combination.\n6 CONCLUSION\nThough the criticism of D-S theory to Bayes approach is jus tifiable, and the \"lower-upper frequency\" approach is mo tivated by similar theoretical considerations [Wang 1993c], the two approaches solve the problem differently.\nD-S theory, though it can be used to accumulate evidence from distinct sources, establishes a unnatural relation be tween degree of belief and weight of evidence by using Dempster's rule for evidence combination. As a result, the assertion that ''probability is a special belief function\" is in\nconflict with the definitions of \"probability\" and \"evidence combination.\"\nThe inconsistency is solvable within D-S theory, but such a solution will make D-S theory either lose its naturalness (by using a concept in a unusual way), or miss its original goals (by being unabl\ufffd to represent probability or to combine evidence).\nThough not specially designed to replace D-S theory in gen eral, the \"lower-upper frequency\" approach does suggest a better way to represent and process uncertainty. 1be new approach sets up a more natural relation among the vari ous measurements of uncertainty, including probability. It can combine evidence from distinct sources. 1berefore, it makes the system capable of carrying out multiple types of inference, such as deduction, induction, and abduction [Wang 1993a, Wang 1993b].\nAcknowledgment .\nThis work is supported by a research assistantship from Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition, Indiana University.
