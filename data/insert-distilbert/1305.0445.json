Deep learning algorithms have been proposed in recent years to move machine learning systems towards the discovery of multiple levels of representation. They have had important empirical successes in a number of traditional AI applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. See (Bengio, 2009; Bengio et al., 2013c) for reviews and Bengio (2013c) and the other chapters of the book (Montavon and Muller, 2012) for practical guidelines. Deep learning is attracting much attention both from the academic and industrial communities. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple, IBM and Baidu are investing in deep learning, with the first widely distributed products being used by consumers aimed at speech recognition. Deep learning is also used for object recognition (Google Goggles), image and music information retrieval (Google Image Search, Google Music), as well as computational advertising (Corrado, 2012). A deep learning building block (the restricted Boltzmann machine, or RBM) was used as a crucial part of the winning entry of a million-dollar machine learning competition (the Netflix competition) (Salakhutdinov et al., 2007; To\u0308scher et al., 2009). The New York Times covered the subject twice in 2012, with front-page articles.1 Another series of articles (including a third New York Times article) covered a more recent event showing off the application of deep learning in a major Kaggle competition for drug discovery (for example see \u201cDeep Learning - The Biggest Data Science Breakthrough of the Decade\u201d2.

For that reason, much of the actual effort in deploying machine learning algorithms goes into the design of preprocessing pipelines that result in a hand-crafted representation of the data that can support effective machine learning. Such feature engineering is important but labor-intensive and highlights the weakness of many traditional learning algorithms: their inability to extract and organize the discriminative information from the data. Feature engineering is a way to take advantage of human ingenuity and prior knowledge to compensate for that weakness. In order to expand the scope and ease of applicability of machine learning, it would be highly desirable to make learning algorithms less dependent on feature engineering, so that novel applications could be constructed faster, and more importantly for the author, to make progress towards artificial intelligence (AI).\nA representation learning algorithm discovers explanatory factors or features. A deep learning algorithm is a particular kind of representation learning procedure that discovers multiple levels of representation, with higher-level features representing more abstract aspects of the data. This area of research was kick-started in 2006 by a few research groups, starting with Geoff Hinton\u2019s group, who initially focused on stacking unsupervised representation learning algorithms to obtain deeper\n2 representations (Hinton et al., 2006; Bengio et al., 2007; Ranzato et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2008). Since then, this area has seen rapid growth, with an increasing number of workshops (now one every year at the NIPS and ICML conferences, the two major conferences in machine learning) and even a new specialized conference just created in 2013 (ICLR \u2013 the International Conference on Learning Representations).\nTransfer learning is the ability of a learning algorithm to exploit commonalities between different learning tasks in order to share statistical strength, and transfer knowledge across tasks. Among the achievements of unsupervised representation learning algorithms are the impressive successes they obtained at the two transfer learning challenges held in 2011. First, the Transfer Learning Challenge, presented at an ICML 2011 workshop of the same name, was won using unsupervised layer-wise pre-training (Bengio, 2011; Mesnil et al., 2011). A second Transfer Learning Challenge was held the same year and won by Goodfellow et al. (2011) using unsupervised representation learning. Results were presented at NIPS 2011\u2019s Challenges in Learning Hierarchical Models Workshop."}, {"heading": "2 Quick Overview of Deep Learning Algorithms", "text": "The central concept behind all deep learning methodology is the automated discovery of abstraction, with the belief that more abstract representations of data such as images, video and audio signals tend to be more useful: they represent the semantic content of the data, divorced from the low-level features of the raw data (e.g., pixels, voxels, or waveforms). Deep architectures lead to abstract representations because more abstract concepts can often be constructed in terms of less abstract ones.\nDeep learning algorithms are special cases of representation learning with the property that they learn multiple levels of representation. Deep learning algorithms often employ shallow (single-layer) representation learning algorithms as subroutines. Before covering the unsupervised representation learning algorithms, we quickly review the basic principles behind supervised representation learning algorithms such as the good old multi-layer neural networks. Supervised and unsupervised objectives can of course be combined (simply added, with a hyperparameter as coefficient), like in Larochelle and Bengio (2008)\u2019s discriminative RBM."}, {"heading": "2.1 Deep Supervised Nets, Convolutional Nets, Dropout", "text": "Before 2006, it was believed that training deep supervised neural networks (Rumelhart et al., 1986) was too difficult (and indeed did not work). The first breakthrough in training them happened in Geoff Hinton\u2019s lab with unsupervised pre-training by RBMs (Hinton et al., 2006), as discussed in the next subsection. However, more recently, it was discovered that one could train deep supervised nets by proper initialization, just large enough for gradients to flow well and activations to convey useful information (Glorot and Bengio, 2010; Sutskever, 2012).3 Another interesting ingredient in the success of training the deep supervised networks of Glorot and Bengio (2010) (and later of Krizhevsky et al. (2012)) is the presence of rectifying non-linearities (such as max(0, x)) instead of sigmoidal non-linearities (such as 1/(1 + exp(\u2212x)) or tanh(x)). See Jarrett et al. (2009); Nair and Hinton (2010) for earlier work on rectifier-like non-linearities. We return to this topic in Section 4. These good results with purely supervised training of deep nets seem to be especially clear when large quantities of labeled data are available, and it was demonstrated with great success for speech recognition (Seide et al., 2011a; Hinton et al., 2012a; Deng et al., 2013) and object recognition (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) with breakthroughs reducing the previous state-of-the-art error rates by 30% to 50% on difficult to beat benchmarks.\nOne of the key ingredients for success in the applications of deep learning to speech, images, and natural language processing (Bengio, 2008; Collobert et al., 2011) is the use of convolutional architectures (LeCun et al., 1998b), which alternate convolutional layers and pooling layers. Units on hidden layers of a convolutional network are associated with a spatial or temporal position and only depend on (or generate) the values in a particular window of the raw input. Furthermore, units on convolutional layers share parameters with other units of the same \u201ctype\u201d located at different positions, while at each location one finds all the different types of units. Units on pooling layers aggregate the outputs of units at a lower layer, either aggregating over different nearby spatial positions (to achieve a form of local spatial invariance) or over different unit types. For example, a max-pooling unit outputs the maximum over some lower level units, which can therefore be seen to compete towards sending their signal forward.\nAnother key ingredient in the success of many recent breakthrough results in the area of object recognition is the idea of dropouts (Hinton et al., 2012b;\n3 and potentially with the use of momentum (Sutskever, 2012)\n3 Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Goodfellow et al., 2013b). Interestingly, it consists in injecting noise (randomly dropping out units with probability 1/2 from the neural network during training, and correspondingly multiplying by 1/2 the weights magnitude at test time) that prevents a too strong co-adaptation of hidden units: hidden units must compute a feature that will be useful even when half of the other hidden units are stochastically turned off (masked). This acts like a powerful regularizer that is similar to bagging aggregation but over an exponentially large number of models (corresponding to different masking patterns, i.e., subsets of the overall network) that share parameters."}, {"heading": "2.2 Unsupervised or Supervised Layer-wise Pre-Training", "text": "One of the key results of recent years of research in deep learning is that deep compositions of non-linearities \u2013 such as found in deep feedforward networks or in recurrent networks applied over long sequences \u2013 can be very sensitive to initialization (some initializations can lead much better or much worse results after training). The first type of approaches that were found useful to reduce that sensitivity is based on greedy layer-wise pre-training (Hinton et al., 2006; Bengio et al., 2007). The idea is to train one layer at a time, starting from lower layers (on top of the input), so that there is a clear training objective for the currently added layer (which typically avoids the need for back-propagating error gradients through many layers of non-linearities). With unsupervised pre-training, each layer is trained to model the distribution of values produced as output of the previous layer. As a side-effect of this training, a new representation is produced, which can be used as input for deeper layers. With the less common supervised pre-training (Bengio et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2010; Seide et al., 2011b), each additional layer is trained with a supervised objective (as part of a one hidden layer network). Again, we obtain a new representation (e.g., the hidden or output layer of the newly trained supervised model) that can be re-used as input for deeper layers. The effect of unsupervised pre-training is apparently most drastic in the context of training deep auto-encoders (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006), unsupervised learners that learn to reconstruct their input: unsupervised pre-training allows to find much lower training and test reconstruction error."}, {"heading": "2.3 Directed and Undirected Graphical Models with Anonymous Latent Variables", "text": "Anonymous latent variables are latent variables that do not have a predefined semantics in terms of predefined\nhuman-interpretable concepts. Instead they are meant as a means for the computer to discover underlying explanatory factors present in the data. We believe that although non-anonymous latent variables can be very useful when there is sufficient prior knowledge to define them, anonymous latent variables are very useful to let the machine discover complex probabilistic structure: they lend flexibility to the model, allowing an otherwise parametric model to non-parametrically adapt to the amount of data when more anonymous variables are introduced in the model.\nPrincipal components analysis (PCA), independent components analysis (ICA), and sparse coding all correspond to a directed graphical model in which the observed vector x is generated by first independently sampling some underlying factors (put in vector h) and then obtaining x by Wh plus some noise. They only differ in the type of prior put on h, and the corresponding inference procedures to recover h (its posterior P (h | x) or expected value E[h | x]) when x is observed. Sparse coding tends to yield many zeros in the estimated vector h that could have generated the observed x. See section 3 of Bengio et al. (2013c) for a review of representation learning procedures based on directed or undirected graphical models.4 Section 2.5 describes sparse coding in more detail.\nAn important thing to keep in mind is that directed graphical models tend to enjoy the property that in computing the posterior, the different factors compete with each other, through the celebrated explaining away effect. Unfortunately, except in very special cases (e.g., when the columns of W are orthogonal, which eliminates explaining away and its need), this results in computationally expensive inference. Although maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference5 remains polynomial-time in the case of sparse coding, this is still very expensive, and unnecessary in other types of models (such as the stacked auto-encoders discussed below). In fact, exact inference becomes intractable for deeper models, as discussed in section 5.\nAlthough RBMs enjoy tractable inference, this is obtained at the cost of a lack of explaining away between the hidden units, which could potentially limit the representational power of E[h | x] as a good representation for the factors that could have generated x. However, RBMs are often used as building blocks for training deeper graphical models such as the deep belief network (DBN) (Hinton et al., 2006) and the deep\n4 Directed and undirected: just two different views on the semantics of probabilistic models, not mutually exclusive, but views that are more convenient for some models than others. 5 finding h that approximately maximizes P (h | x)\n4 Boltzmann machine (DBM) (Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2009), which can compensate for the lack of explaining away in the RBM hidden units via a rich prior (provided by the upper layers) which can introduce potentially complex interactions and competition between the hidden units. Note that there is explaining away (and intractable exact inference) in DBNs and something analogous in DBMs."}, {"heading": "2.4 Regularized Auto-Encoders", "text": "Auto-encoders include in their training criterion a form of reconstruction error, such as ||r(x)\u2212x||2 , where r(\u00b7) is the learned reconstruction function, often decomposed as r(x) = g(f(x)) where f(\u00b7) is an encoding function and g(\u00b7) a decoding function. The idea is that auto-encoders should have low reconstruction error at the training examples, but high reconstruction error in most other configurations of the input. In the case of auto-encoders, good generalization means that test examples (sampled from the same distribution as training examples) also get low reconstruction error. Auto-encoders have to be regularized to prevent them from simply learning the identity function r(x) = x, which would be useless. Regularized auto-encoders include the old bottleneck auto-encoders (like in PCA) with less hidden units than input, as well as the denoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008) and contractive auto-encoders (Rifai et al., 2011a). The denoising auto-encoder takes a noisy version N(x) of original input x and tries to reconstruct x, e.g., it minimizes ||r(N(x)) \u2212 x||2. The contractive auto-encoder has a regularization penalty in addition to the reconstruction error, trying to make hidden units f(x) as constant as possible with respect to x (minimizing the contractive penalty ||\u2202f(x)\n\u2202x ||2F ). A Taylor expansion\nof the denoising error shows that it is also approximately equivalent to minimizing reconstruction error plus a contractive penalty on r(\u00b7) (Alain and Bengio, 2012). As explained in Bengio et al. (2013c), the tugof-war between minimization of reconstruction error and the regularizer means that the intermediate representation must mostly capture the variations necessary to distinguish training examples, i.e., the directions of variations on the manifold (a lower dimensional region) near which the data generating distribution concentrates. Score matching (Hyva\u0308rinen, 2005) is an inductive principle that can be an interesting alternative to maximum likelihood, and several connections have been drawn between reconstruction error in auto-encoders and score matching (Swersky et al., 2011). It has also been shown that denoising autoencoders and some forms of contractive auto-encoders\nestimate the score6 of the underlying data generating distribution (Vincent, 2011; Alain and Bengio, 2012). This can be used to endow regularized auto-encoders with a probabilistic interpretation and to sample from the implicitly learned density models (Rifai et al., 2012b; Bengio et al., 2012; Alain and Bengio, 2012) through some variant of Langevin or Metropolis-Hastings MonteCarlo Markov chains (MCMC).\nEven though there is a probabilistic interpretation to regularized auto-encoders, this interpretation does not involve the definition of intermediate anonymous latent variables. Instead, they are based on the construction of a direct parametrization of an encoding function which immediately maps an input x to its representation f(x), and they are motivated by geometrical considerations in the spirit of manifold learning algorithms (Bengio et al., 2013c). Consequently, there is no issue of tractability of inference, even with deep auto-encoders obtained by stacking single-layer ones.\nIt was previously believed (Ranzato et al., 2008), including by the author himself, that reconstruction error should only be small where the estimated density has a peak, e.g., near the data. However, recent theoretical and empirical results (Alain and Bengio, 2012) show that the reconstruction error will be small where the estimated density has a peak (a mode) but also where it has a trough (a minimum). This is because the reconstruction error vector (reconstruction minus input) estimates the score \u2202 log p(x)\n\u2202x , i.e., the reconstruction error is small where\n||\u2202 log p(x) \u2202x\n|| is small. This can happen at a local maximum but also at a local minimum (or saddle point) of the estimated density. This argues against using reconstruction error itself as an energy function,7 which should only be low near high probability points."}, {"heading": "2.5 Sparse Coding and PSD", "text": "Sparse coding (Olshausen and Field, 1996) is a particular kind of directed graphical model with a linear relationship between visible and latent variables (like in PCA), but in which the latent variables have a prior (e.g., Laplace density) that encourages sparsity (many zeros) in the MAP posterior. Sparse coding is not actually very good as a generative model, but has been very successful for unsupervised feature learning (Raina et al., 2007; Coates and Ng, 2011; Yu et al., 2011; Grosse et al., 2007; Jenatton et al., 2009;\n6 derivative of the log-density with respect to the data; this is different from the usual definition of score in statistics, where the derivative is with respect to the parameters 7 To define energy, we write probability as the normalized exponential of minus the energy.\n5 Bach et al., 2011). See Bengio et al. (2013c) for a brief overview in the context of deep learning, along with connections to other unsupervised representation learning algorithms. Like other directed graphical models, it requires somewhat expensive inference, but the good news is that for sparse coding, MAP inference is a convex optimization problem for which several fast approximations have been proposed (Mairal et al., 2009; Gregor and LeCun, 2010a). It is interesting to note the results obtained by Coates and Ng (2011) which suggest that sparse coding is a better encoder but not a better learning algorithm than RBMs and sparse autoencoders (none of which has explaining away). Note also that sparse coding can be generalized into the spike-andslab sparse coding algorithm (Goodfellow et al., 2012), in which MAP inference is replaced by variational inference, and that was used to win the NIPS 2011 transfer learning challenge (Goodfellow et al., 2011).\nAnother interesting variant on sparse coding is the predictive sparse coding (PSD) algorithm (Kavukcuoglu et al., 2008) and its variants, which combine properties of sparse coding and of auto-encoders. Sparse coding can be seen as having only a parametric \u201cgenerative\u201d decoder (which maps latent variable values to visible variable values) and a non-parametric encoder (find the latent variables value that minimizes reconstruction error and minus the log-prior on the latent variable). PSD adds a parametric encoder (just an affine transformation followed by a non-linearity) and learns it jointly with the generative model, such that the output of the parametric encoder is close to the latent variable values that reconstructs well the input."}, {"heading": "3 Scaling Computations", "text": "From a computation point of view, how do we scale the recent successes of deep learning to much larger models and huge datasets, such that the models are actually richer and capture a very large amount of information?"}, {"heading": "3.1 Scaling Computations: The Challenge", "text": "The beginnings of deep learning in 2006 have focused on the MNIST digit image classification problem (Hinton et al., 2006; Bengio et al., 2007), breaking the supremacy of SVMs (1.4% error) on this dataset.8\n8 for the knowledge-free version of the task, where no imagespecific prior is used, such as image deformations or convolutions, where the current state-of-the-art is around 0.8% and involves deep learning (Rifai et al., 2011b; Hinton et al., 2012b).\nThe latest records are still held by deep networks: Ciresan et al. (2012) currently claim the title of stateof-the-art for the unconstrained version of the task (e.g., using a convolutional architecture and stochastically deformed data), with 0.27% error.\nIn the last few years, deep learning has moved from digits to object recognition in natural images, and the latest breakthrough has been achieved on the ImageNet dataset.9 bringing down the state-ofthe-art error rate (out of 5 guesses) from 26.1% to 15.3% (Krizhevsky et al., 2012)\nTo achieve the above scaling from 28\u00d728 grey-level MNIST images to 256\u00d7256 RGB images, researchers have taken advantage of convolutional architectures (meaning that hidden units do not need to be connected to all units at the previous layer but only to those in the same spatial area, and that pooling units reduce the spatial resolution as we move from lower to higher layers). They have also taken advantage of GPU technology to speed-up computation by one or two orders of magnitude (Raina et al., 2009; Bergstra et al., 2010, 2011; Krizhevsky et al., 2012).\nWe can expect computational power to continue to increase, mostly through increased parallelism such as seen in GPUs, multicore machines, and clusters. In addition, computer memory has become much more affordable, allowing (at least on CPUs) to handle potentially huge models (in terms of capacity).\nHowever, whereas the task of recognizing handwritten digits is solved to the point of achieving roughly humanlevel performance, this is far from true for tasks such as general object recognition, scene understanding, speech recognition, or natural language understanding. What is needed to nail those tasks and scale to even more ambitious ones?\nAs we approach AI-scale tasks, it should become clear that our trained models will need to be much larger in terms of number of parameters. This is suggested by two observations. First, AI means understanding the world around us at roughly the same level of competence as humans. Extrapolating from the current state of machine learning, the amount of knowledge this represents is bound to be large, many times more than what current models can capture. Second, more and more empirical results with deep learning suggest that larger models systematically work better (Coates et al., 2011; Hinton et al., 2012b; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Goodfellow et al., 2013b), provided appropriate regular-\n9 The 1000-class ImageNet benchmark, whose results are detailed here: http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/\nresults.html\n6 ization is used, such as the dropouts technique described above.\nPart of the challenge is that the current capabilities of a single computer are not sufficient to achieve these goals, even if we assume that training complexity would scale linearly with the complexity of the task. This has for example motivated the work of the Google Brain team (Le et al., 2012; Dean et al., 2012) to parallelize training of deep nets over a very large number of nodes. As we will see in Section 4, we hypothesize that as the size of the models increases, our current ways of training deep networks become less and less efficient, so that the computation required to train larger models (to capture correspondingly more information) is likely to scale much worse than linearly (Dauphin and Bengio, 2013).\nAnother part of the challenge is that the increase in computational power has been mostly coming (and will continue to come) from parallel computing. Unfortunately, when considering very large datasets, our most efficient training algorithms for deep learning (such as variations on stochastic gradient descent or SGD) are inherently sequential (each update of the parameters requires having completed the previous update, so they cannot be trivially parallelized). Furthermore, for some tasks, the amount of available data available is becoming so large that it does not fit on a disk or even on a file server, so that it is not clear how a single CPU core could even scan all that data (which seems necessary in order to learn from it and exploit all of it, if training is inherently sequential)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Scaling Computations: Solution Paths", "text": "Parallel Updates: Asynchronous SGD. One idea that we explored in Bengio et al. (2003) is that of asynchronous SGD: train multiple versions of the model in parallel, each running on a different node and seeing different subsets of the data (on different disks), but with an asynchronous lock-free sharing mechanism which keeps the different versions of the model not too far from each other. If the sharing were synchronous, it would be too inefficient because most nodes would spend their time waiting for the sharing to be completed and would be waiting for the slowest of the nodes. This idea has been analyzed theoretically (Recht et al., 2011) and successfully engineered on a grand scale recently at Google (Le et al., 2012; Dean et al., 2012). However, current large-scale implementations (with thousands of nodes) are still very inefficient (in terms of use of the parallel resources), mostly because of the communication bottleneck requiring to regularly exchange parameter values between nodes. The above papers also take advantage of a way to train deep networks which has\nbeen very successful for GPU implementations, namely the use of rather large minibatches (blocks of examples after which an update is performed), making some parallelization (across the examples in the minibatch) easier. One option, explored by Coates et al. (2012) is to use as building blocks for learning features algorithms such as k-means that can be run efficiently over large minibatches (or the whole data) and thus parallelized easily on a cluster (they learned 150,000 features on a cluster with only 30 machines).\nAnother interesting consideration is the optimization of trade-off between communication cost and computation cost in distributed optimization algorithms, e.g., as discussed in Tsianos et al. (2012).\nSparse Updates. One idea that we propose here is to change the learning algorithms so as to obtain sparse updates, i.e., for any particular minibatch there is only a small fraction of parameters that are updated. If the amount of sparsity in the update is large, this would mean that a much smaller fraction of the parameters need to be exchanged between nodes when performing an asynchronous SGD10. Sparse updates could be obtained simply if the gradient is very sparse. This gradient sparsity can arise with approaches that select paths in the neural network. We already know methods which produce slightly sparse updates, such as dropouts (Hinton et al., 2012b),11 maxout (Goodfellow et al., 2013b)12 and other hard-pooling mechanisms, such as the recently proposed and very successful stochastic pooling (Zeiler and Fergus, 2013). These methods do not provide enough sparsity, but this could be achieved in two ways. First of all, we could choose to only pay attention to the largest elements of the gradient vector. Second, we could change the architecture along the lines proposed next.\nConditional Computation. A central idea (that applies whether one parallelizes or not) that we put forward is that of conditional computation: instead of dropping out paths independently and at random, drop them in a\n10 although the gain would be reduced considerably in a minibatch mode, roughly by the size of the minibatch 11 where half of the hidden units are turned off, although clearly, this is not enough sparsity for reaching our objective; unfortunately, we observed that randomly and independently dropping a lot more than half of the units yielded substantially worse results 12 where in addition to dropouts, only one out of k filters wins the competition in max-pooling units, and only one half of those survives the dropouts masking, making the sparsity factor 2k\n7 learned and optimized way. Decision trees remain some of the most appealing machine learning algorithms because prediction time can be on the order of the logarithm of the number of parameters. Instead, in most other machine learning predictors, scaling is linear (i.e., much worse). This is because decision trees exploit conditional computation: for a given example, as additional computations are performed, one can discard a gradually larger set of parameters (and avoid performing the associated computation). In deep learning, this could be achieved by combining truly sparse activations (values not near zero like in sparse auto-encoders, but actual zeros) and multiplicative connections whereby some hidden units gate other hidden units (when the gater output is zero it turns off the output of the gated unit). When a group A of hidden units has a sparse activation pattern (with many actual zeros) and it multiplicatively gates other hidden units B, then only a small fraction of the hidden units in B may need to be actually computed, because we know that these values will not be used. Such gating is similar to what happens when a decision node of a decision tree selects a subtree and turns off another subtree. More savings can thus be achieved if units in B themselves gate other units, etc. The crucial difference with decision trees (and e.g., the hard mixture of experts we introduced a decade ago (Collobert et al., 2003)) is that the gating units should not be mutually exclusive and should instead form a distributed pattern. Indeed, we want to keep the advantages of distributed representations and avoid the limited local generalization suffered by decision trees (Bengio et al., 2010). With a high level of conditional computation, some parameters are used often (and are well tuned) whereas other parameters are used very rarely, requiring more data to estimate. A trade-off and appropriate regularization therefore needs to be established which will depend on the amount of training signals going into each parameter. Interestingly, conditional computation also helps to achieve sparse gradients, and the fast convergence of hard mixtures of experts (Collobert et al., 2003) provides positive evidence that a side benefit of conditional computation will be easier and faster optimization.\nAnother existing example of conditional computation and sparse gradients is with the first layer of neural language models, deep learning models for text data (Bengio et al., 2003; Bengio, 2008). In that case, there is one parameter vector per word in the vocabulary, but each sentence only \u201ctouches\u201d the parameters associated with the words in the sentence. It works because the input can be seen as extremely sparse. The question is how to perform conditional computation in the rest of the model.\nOne issue with the other example we mentioned, hard mixtures of experts (Collobert et al., 2003), is that its training mechanism only make sense when the gater operates at the output layer. In that case, it is easy to get a strong and clean training signal for the gater output: one can just evaluate what the error would have been if a different expert had been chosen, and train the gater to produce a higher output for the expert that would have produced the smallest error (or to reduce computation and only interrogate two experts, require that the gater correctly ranks their probability of being the best one). The challenge is how to produce training signals for gating units that operate in the middle of the model. One cannot just enumerate all the gating configurations, because in a distributed setting with many gating units, there will be an exponential number of configurations. Interestingly, this suggests introducing randomness in the gating process itself, e.g., stochastically choosing one or two choices out of the many that a group of gating units could take. This is interesting because this is the second motivation (after the success of dropouts as a regularizer) for re-introducing randomness in the middle of deep networks. This randomness would allow configurations that would otherwise not be selected (if only a kind of \u201cmax\u201d dictated the gating decision) to be sometimes selected, thus allowing to accumulate a training signal about the value of this configuration, i.e., a training signal for the gater. The general question of estimating or propagating gradients through stochastic neurons is treated in another exploratory article (Bengio, 2013a), where it is shown that one can obtain an unbiased (but noisy) estimator of the gradient of a loss through a discrete stochastic decision. Another interesting idea explored in that paper is that of adding noise just before the non-linearity (maxpooling (maxi xi) or rectifier (max(0, x))). Hence the winner is not always the same, and when a choice wins it has a smooth influence on the result, and that allows a gradient signal to be provided, pushing that winner closer or farther from winning the competition on another example."}, {"heading": "4 Optimization", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.1 Optimization: The Challenge", "text": "As we consider larger and larger datasets (growing faster than the size of the models), training error and generalization error converge. Furthermore many pieces of evidence in the results of experiments on deep learning suggest that training deep networks (including recurrent networks) involves a difficult optimization (Bengio, 2013b; Gulcehre and Bengio, 2013; Bengio et al., 2013a). It is not yet clear how much of the difficulty is due to local minima and how much is due to ill-conditioning (the\n8 two main types of optimization difficulties in continuous optimization problems). It is therefore interesting to study the optimization methods and difficulties involved in deep learning, for the sake of obtaining better generalization. Furthermore, better optimization could also have an impact on scaling computations, discussed above.\nOne important thing to keep in mind, though, is that in a deep supervised network, the top two layers (the output layer and the top hidden layer) can rather easily be made to overfit, simply by making the top hidden layer large enough. However, to get good generalization, what we have found is that one needs to optimize the lower layers, those that are far removed from the immediate supervised training signal (Bengio et al., 2007). These observations mean that only looking at the training criterion is not sufficient to assess that a training procedure is doing a good job at optimizing the lower layers well. However, under constraints on the top hidden layer size, training error can be a good guide to the quality of the optimization of lower layers. Note that supervised deep nets are very similar (in terms of the optimization problem involved) to deep auto-encoders and to recurrent or recursive networks, and that properly optimizing RBMs (and more so deep Boltzmann machines) seems more difficult: progress on training deep nets is therefore likely to be a key to training the other types of deep learning models.\nOne of the early hypotheses drawn from experiments with layer-wise pre-training as well as of other experiments (semi-supervised embeddings (Weston et al., 2008) and slow feature analysis (Wiskott and Sejnowski, 2002a; Bergstra and Bengio, 2009)) is that the training signal provided by backpropagated gradients is sometimes too weak to properly train intermediate layers of a deep network. This is supported by the observation that all of these successful techniques somehow inject a training signal into the intermediate layers, helping them to figure out what they should do. However, the more recent successful results with supervised learning on very large labeled datasets suggest that with some tweaks in the optimization procedure (including initialization), it is sometimes possible to achieve as good results with or without unsupervised pre-training or semi-supervised embedding intermediate training signals."}, {"heading": "4.2 Optimization: Solution Paths", "text": "In spite of these recent encouraging results, several more recent experimental results again point to a fundamental difficulty in training intermediate and lower layers.\nDiminishing Returns with Larger Networks. First, Dauphin and Bengio (2013) show that with well-\noptimized SGD training, as the size of a neural net increases, the \u201creturn on investment\u201d (number of training errors removed per added hidden unit) decreases, given a fixed number of training iterations, until the point where it goes below 1 (which is the return on investment that would be obtained by a brain-dead memory-based learning mechanism \u2013 such as Parzen Windows \u2013 which just copies an incorrectly labeled example into the weights of the added hidden unit so as to produce just the right answer for that example only). This suggests that larger models may be fundamentally more difficult to train, probably because there are now more second-order interactions between the parameters, increasing the condition number of the Hessian matrix (of second derivatives of model parameters with respect to the training criterion). This notion of return on investment may provide a useful metric by which to measure the effect of different methods to improve the scaling behavior of training and optimization procedures for deep learning.\nIntermediate Concepts Guidance and Curriculum. Second, Gulcehre and Bengio (2013) show that there are apparently simple tasks on which standard black-box machine learning algorithms completely fail. Even supervised and pre-trained deep networks were tested and failed at these tasks. These tasks have in common the characteristic that the correct labels are obtained by the composition of at least two levels of non-linearity and abstraction: e.g., the first level involves the detection of objects in a scene and the second level involves a non-linear logical operation on top of these (such as the detecting presence of multiple objects of the same category). On the other hand, the task becomes easily solvable by a deep network whose intermediate layer is first pretrained to solve the first-level sub-task. This raises the question of how humans might learn even more abstract tasks, and Bengio (2013b) studies the hypothesis that the use of language and the evolution of culture could have helped humans reduce that difficulty (and gain a serious advantage over other less cultured animals). It would be interesting to explore multi-agent learning mechanisms inspired by the the mathematical principles behind the evolution of culture in order to bypass this optimization difficulty. The basic idea is that humans (and current learning algorithms) are limited to \u201clocal descent\u201d optimization methods, that make small changes in the parameter values with the effect of reducing the expected loss in average. This is clearly prone to the presence of local minima, while a more global search (in the spirit of both genetic and cultural evolution) could potentially reduce this difficulty. One hypothesis is that more abstract learning tasks involve more challenging optimization difficul-\n9 ties, which would make such global optimization algorithms necessary if we want computers to learn such abstractions from scratch. Another option, following the idea of curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009), is to provide guidance ourselves to learning machines (as exemplified in the toy example of Gulcehre and Bengio (2013)), by \u201cteaching them\u201d gradually more complex concepts to help them understand the world around us (keeping in mind that we also have to do that for humans and that it takes 20 years to complete).\nChanging the learning procedure and the architecture. Regarding the basic optimization difficulty of a single deep network, three types of solutions should be considered. First, there are solutions based on improved general-purpose optimization algorithms, such as for example the recent work on adaptive learning rates (Schaul et al., 2012), online natural gradient (Le Roux et al., 2008; Pascanu and Bengio, 2013) or large-minibatch second order methods (Martens, 2010).\nAnother class of attacks on the optimization problem is based on changing the architecture (family of functions and its parametrization) or the way that the outputs are produced (for example by adding noise). As already introduced in LeCun et al. (1998a), changes in the preprocessing, training objective and architecture can change the difficulty of optimization, and in particularly improve the conditioning of the Hessian matrix (of second derivatives of the loss with respect to parameters). With gradient descent, training time into a quadratic bowl is roughly proportional to the condition number of the Hessian matrix (ratio of largest to smallest eigenvalue). For example LeCun et al. (1998a) recommends centering and normalizing the inputs, an idea recently extended to hidden layers of Boltzmann machines with success (Montavon and Muller, 2012). A related idea that may have an impact on ill-conditioning is the idea of skip-connections, which forces both the mean output and the mean slope of each hidden unit of a deep multilayer network to be zero (Raiko et al., 2012), a centering idea which originates from Schraudolph (1998).\nThere has also been very successful recent work exploiting rectifier non-linearities for deep supervised networks (Glorot et al., 2011a; Krizhevsky et al., 2012). Interestingly, such non-linearities can produce rather sparse unit outputs, which could be exploited, if the amount of sparsity is sufficiently large, to considerably reduce the necessary computation (because when a unit output is 0, there is no need to actually multiply it with its outgoing weights). Very recently, we have discovered a variant on the rectifier non-linearity called maxout (Goodfellow et al., 2013b) which appears\nto open a very promising door towards more efficient training of deep networks. As confirmed experimentally (Goodfellow et al., 2013b), maxout networks can train deeper networks and allow lower layers to undergo more training. The more general principle at stake here may be that when the gradient is sparse, i.e., only a small subset of the hidden units and parameters is touched by the gradient, the optimization problem may become easier. We hypothesize that sparse gradient vectors have a positive effect on reducing the ill-conditioning difficulty involved in training deep nets. The intuition is that by making many terms of the gradient vector 0, one also knocks off many off-diagonal terms of the Hessian matrix, making this matrix more diagonal-looking, which would reduce many of the ill-conditioning effects involved, as explained below. Indeed, gradient descent relies on an invalid assumption: that one can modify a parameter \u03b8i (in the direction of the gradient \u2202C\u2202\u03b8i ) without taking into account the changes in \u2202C \u2202\u03b8i\nthat will take place when also modifying other parameters \u03b8j . Indeed, this is precisely the information that is captured (e.g. with second-order methods) by the off-diagonal entries \u2202\n2C \u2202\u03b8i\u2202\u03b8j = \u2202 \u2202\u03b8j \u2202C \u2202\u03b8i\n, i.e., how changing \u03b8j changes the gradient on \u03b8i. Whereas second-order methods may have their own limitations13 it would be interesting if substantially reduced ill-conditioning could be achieved by modifying the architecture and training procedure. Sparse gradients would be just one weapon in this line of attack.\nAs we have argued above, adding noise in an appropriate way can be useful as a powerful regularizer (as in dropouts), and it can also be used to make the gradient vector sparser, which would reinforce the above positive effect on the optimization difficulty. If some of the activations are also sparse (as our suggestions for conditional computation would require), then more entries of the gradient vector will be zeroed out, also reinforcing that beneficial optimization effect. In addition, it is plausible that the masking noise found in dropouts (as well as in denoising auto-encoders) encourages a faster symmetry-breaking: quickly moving away from the condition where all hidden units of a neural network or a Boltzmann machine do the same thing (due to a form of symmetry in the signals they receive), which is a nonattractive fixed point with a flat (up to several orders) likelihood function. This means that gradient descent can take a lot of time to pull apart hidden units which are behaving in a very similar way. Furthermore, when starting\n13 first, practical implementations never come close to actually inverting the Hessian, and second, they often require line searches that may be computationally inefficient if the optimal trajectory is highly curved\n10\nfrom small weights, these symmetry conditions (where many hidden units do something similar) are actually attractive from far away, because initially all the hidden units are trying to grab the easiest and most salient job (explain the gradients on the units at the layer above). By randomly turning off hidden units we obtain a faster specialization which helps training convergence.\nA related concept that has been found useful in understanding and reducing the training difficulty of deep or recurrent nets is the importance of letting the training signals (back-propagated gradients) flow, in a focused way. It is important that error signals flow so that credit and blame is clearly assigned to different components of the model, those that could change slightly to improve the training loss. The problem of vanishing and exploding gradients in recurrent nets (Hochreiter, 1991; Bengio et al., 1994) arises because the effect of a long series of non-linear composition tends to produce gradients that can either be very small (and the error signal is lost) or very large (and the gradient steps diverge temporarily). This idea has been exploited to propose successful initialization procedures for deep nets (Glorot and Bengio, 2010). A composition of non-linearities is associated with a product of Jacobian matrices, and a way to reduce the vanishing problem would be to make sure that they have a spectral radius (largest eigenvalue) close to 1, like what is done in the weight initialization for Echo State Networks (Jaeger, 2007) or in the carousel self-loop of LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) to help propagation of influences over longer paths. A more generic way to avoid gradient vanishing is to incorporate a training penalty that encourages the propagated gradient vectors to maintain their magnitude (Pascanu and Bengio, 2012). When combined with a gradient clipping14 heuristic (Mikolov, 2012) to avoid the detrimental effect of overly large gradients, it allows to train recurrent nets on tasks on which it was not possible to train them before (Pascanu and Bengio, 2012)."}, {"heading": "5 Inference and Sampling", "text": "All of the graphical models studied for deep learning except the humble RBM require a non-trivial form of inference, i.e., guessing values of the latent variables h that are appropriate for the given visible input x. Several forms of inference have been investigated in the past: MAP inference is formulated like an optimization problem (looking for h that approximately maximizes P (h | x)); MCMC inference attempts to sample a sequence of h\u2019s from P (h | x); variational inference looks\n14 When the norm of the gradient is above a threshold \u03c4 , reduce it to \u03c4\nfor a simple (typically factorial) approximate posterior qx(h) that is close to P (h | x), and usually involves an iterative optimization procedure. See a recent machine learning textbook for more details (Bishop, 2006; Barber, 2011; Murphy, 2012).\nIn addition, a challenge related to inference is sampling (not just from P (h | x) but also from P (h, x) or P (x)), which like inference is often needed in the inner loop of learning algorithms for probabilistic models with latent variables, energy-based models (LeCun et al., 2006) or Markov Random Fields (Kindermann, 1980) (also known as undirected graphical models), where P (x) or P (h, x) is defined in terms of a parametrized energy function whose normalized exponential gives probabilities.\nDeep Boltzmann machines (Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2009) combine the challenge of inference (for the \u201cpositive phase\u201d where one tries to push the energies associated with the observed x down) and the challenge of sampling (for the \u201cnegative phase\u201d where one tries to push up the energies associated with x\u2019s sampled from P (x)). Sampling for the negative phase is usually done by MCMC, although some learning algorithms (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Gutmann and Hyvarinen, 2010; Bordes et al., 2013) involve \u201cnegative examples\u201d that are sampled through simpler procedures (like perturbations of the observed input). In Salakhutdinov and Hinton (2009), inference for the positive phase is achieved with a mean-field variational approximation.15"}, {"heading": "5.1 Inference and Sampling: The Challenge", "text": "There are several challenges involved with all of the these inference and sampling techniques.\nThe first challenge is practical and computational: these are all iterative procedures that can considerably slow down training (because inference and/or sampling is often in the inner loop of learning).\nPotential Huge Number of Modes. The second challenge is more fundamental and has to do with the potential existence of highly multi-modal posteriors: all of the currently known approaches to inference and sampling are making very strong explicit or implicit assumptions on the form the distribution of interest (P (h | x)\n15 In the mean-field approximation, computation proceeds like in Gibbs sampling, but with stochastic binary values replaced by their conditional expected value (probability of being 1), given the outputs of the other units. This deterministic computation is iterated like in a recurrent network until convergence is approached, to obtain a marginal (factorized probability) approximation over all the units.\n11\nor P (h, x)). As we argue below, these approaches make sense if this target distribution is either approximately unimodal (MAP), (conditionally) factorizes (variational approximations, i.e., the different factors hi are approximately independent16 of each other given x), or has only a few modes between which it is easy to mix (MCMC). However, approximate inference can be potentially hurtful, not just at test time but for training, because it is often in the inner loop of the learning procedure (Kulesza and Pereira, 2008).\nImagine for example that h represents many explanatory variables of a rich audio-visual scene with a highly ambiguous raw input x, including the presence of several objects with ambiguous attributes or categories, such that one cannot really disambiguate one of the objects independently of the others (the so-called \u201cstructured output\u201d scenario, but at the level of latent explanatory variables). Clearly, a factorized or unimodal representation would be inadequate (because these variables are not at all independent, given x) while the number of modes could grow exponentially with the number of ambiguous factors present in the scene. For example, consider a visual scene x through a haze hiding most details, yielding a lot of uncertainty. Say it involves 10 objects (e.g., people), each having 5 ambiguous binary attributes (out of 20) (e.g., how they are dressed) and uncertainty between 100 categorical choices for each element (e.g., out of 10000 persons in the database, the marginal evidence allows to reduce the uncertainty for each person to about 100 choices). Furthermore, suppose that these uncertainties cannot be factorized (e.g., people tend to be in the same room with other people involved in the same activity, and friends tend to stand physically close to each other, and people choose to dress in a way that socially coherent). To make life hard on meanfield and other factorized approximations, this means that only a small fraction (say 1%) of these configurations are really compatible. So one really has to consider 1%\u00d7(25\u00d7100)10 \u2248 1033 plausible configurations of the latent variables. If one has to take a decision y based on x, e.g., P (y | x) = \u2211 h P (y | h)P (h | x) involves summing over a huge number of non-negligible terms of the posterior P (h | x), which we can consider as modes (the actual dimension of h is much larger, so we have reduced the problem from (220 \u00d7 10000)10 \u2248 10100 to about 1033, but that is still huge. One way or another, summing explicitly over that many modes seems implausible, and assuming single mode (MAP) or a factorized distribution (mean-field) would yield very poor results. Under some\n16 this can be relaxed by considering tree-structured conditional dependencies (Saul and Jordan, 1996) and mixtures thereof\nassumptions on the underlying data-generating process, it might well be possible to do inference that is exact or a provably good approximations, and searching for graphical models with these properties is an interesting avenue to deal with this problem. Basically, these assumptions work because we assume a specific structure in the form of the underlying distribution. Also, if we are lucky, a few Monte-Carlo samples from P (h | x) might suffice to obtain an acceptable approximation for our y, because somehow, as far as y is concerned, many probable values of h yield the same answer y and a Monte-Carlo sample will well represent these different \u201ctypes\u201d of values of h. That is one form of regularity that could be exploited (if it exists) to approximately solve that problem. What if these assumptions are not appropriate to solve challenging AI problems? Another, more general assumption (and thus one more likely to be appropriate for these problems) is similar to what we usually do with machine learning: although the space of functions is combinatorially large, we are able to generalize by postulating a rather large and flexible family of functions (such as a deep neural net). Thus an interesting avenue is to assume that there exists a computationally tractable function that can compute P (y | x) in spite of the apparent complexity of going through the intermediate steps involving h, and that we may learn P (y | x) through (x, y) examples. This idea will be developed further in Section 5.2.\nMixing Between Modes. What about MCMC methods? They are hurt by the problem of mode mixing, discussed at greater length in Bengio et al. (2013b), and summarized here. To make the mental picture simpler, imagine that there are only two kinds of probabilities: tiny and high. MCMC transitions try to stay in configurations that have a high probability (because they should occur in the chain much more often than the tiny probability configurations). Modes can be thought of as islands of high probability, but they may be separated by vast seas of tiny probability configurations. Hence, it is difficult for the Markov chain of MCMC methods to jump from one mode of the distribution to another, when these are separated by large low-density regions embedded in a high-dimensional space, a common situation in real-world data, and under the manifold hypothesis (Cayton, 2005; Narayanan and Mitter, 2010). This hypothesis states that natural classes present in the data (e.g., visual object categories) are associated with lowdimensional regions17 (i.e., manifolds) near which the distribution concentrates, and that different class manifolds are well-separated by regions of very low density. Here, what we consider a mode may be more than a sin-\n17 e.g. they can be charted with a few coordinates\n12\ngle point, it could be a whole (low-dimensional) manifold. Slow mixing between modes means that consecutive samples tend to be correlated (belong to the same mode) and that it takes a very large number of consecutive sampling steps to go from one mode to another and even more to cover all of them, i.e., to obtain a large enough representative set of samples (e.g. to compute an expected value under the sampled variables distribution). This happens because these jumps through the low-density void between modes are unlikely and rare events. When a learner has a poor model of the data, e.g., in the initial stages of learning, the model tends to correspond to a smoother and higher-entropy (closer to uniform) distribution, putting mass in larger volumes of input space, and in particular, between the modes (or manifolds). This can be visualized in generated samples of images, that look more blurred and noisy18. Since MCMCs tend to make moves to nearby probable configurations, mixing between modes is therefore initially easy for such poor models. However, as the model improves and its corresponding distribution sharpens near where the data concentrate, mixing between modes becomes considerably slower. Making one unlikely move (i.e., to a low-probability configuration) may be possible, but making N such moves becomes exponentially unlikely in N . Making moves that are far and probable is fundamentally difficult in a high-dimensional space associated with a peaky distribution (because the exponentially large fraction of the far moves would be to an unlikely configuration), unless using additional (possibly learned) knowledge about the structure of the distribution."}, {"heading": "5.2 Inference and Sampling: Solution Paths", "text": "Going into a space where mixing is easier. The idea of tempering (Iba, 2001) for MCMCs is analogous to the idea of simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983) for optimization, and it is designed for and looks very appealing to solve the mode mixing problem: consider a smooth version (higher temperature, obtained by just dividing the energy by a temperature greater than 1) of the distribution of interest; it therefore spreads probability mass more uniformly so one can mix between modes at that high temperature version of the model, and then gradually cool to the target distribution while continuing to make MCMC moves, to make sure we end up in one of the \u201cislands\u201d of high probability. Desjardins et al. (2010); Cho et al. (2010); Salakhutdinov (2010b,a) have\n18 See examples of generated images with some of the current state-of-the-art in learned generative models of images (Courville et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2013)\nall considered various forms of tempering to address the failure of Gibbs chain mixing in RBMs. Unfortunately, convincing solutions (in the sense of making a practical impact on training efficiency) have not yet been clearly demonstrated. It is not clear why this is so, but it may be due to the need to spend much time at some specific (critical) temperatures in order to succeed. More work is certainly warranted in that direction.\nAn interesting observation (Bengio et al., 2013b) which could turn out to be helpful is that after we train a deep model such as a DBN or a stack of regularized autoencoders, we can observe that mixing between modes is much easier at higher levels of the hierarchy (e.g. in the top-level RBM or top-level auto-encoder): mixing between modes is easier at deeper levels of representation. This is achieved by running the MCMC in a high-level representation space and then projecting back in raw input space to obtain samples at that level. The hypothesis proposed (Bengio et al., 2013b) to explain this observation is that unsupervised representation learning procedures (such as for the RBM and contractive or denoising auto-encoders) tend to discover a representation whose distribution has more entropy (the distribution of vectors in higher layers is more uniform) and that better \u201cdisentangles\u201d or separates out the underlying factors of variation (see next section for a longer discussion of the concept of disentangling). For example, suppose that a perfect disentangling had been achieved that extracted the factors out of images of objects, such as object category, position, foreground color, etc. A single Gibbs step could thus switch a single top-level variable (like object category) when that variable is resampled given the others, a very local move in that top-level disentangled representation but a very far move (going to a very different place) in pixel space. Note that maximizing mutual information between inputs and their learned deterministic representation, which is what auto-encoders basically do (Vincent et al., 2008), is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of the learned representation,19 which supports this hypothesis. An interesting idea20 would therefore be to use higher levels of a deep model to help the lower layers mix better, by using them in a way analogous to parallel tempering, i.e., to suggest configurations sampled from a different mode.\nAnother interesting potential avenue for solving the problem of sampling from a complex and rough (nonsmooth) distribution would be to take advantage of quantum annealing effects (Rose and Macready, 2007) and analog computing hardware (such as produced by DWave). NP-hard problems (such as sampling or optimiz-\n19 Salah Rifai, personal communication 20 Guillaume Desjardins, personal communication\n13\ning exactly in an Ising model) still require exponential time but experimental evidence has shown that for some problems, quantum annealing is far superior to standard digital computation (Brooke et al., 2001). Since quantum annealing is performed by essentially implementing a Boltzmann machine in analog hardware, it might be the case that drawing samples from a Boltzmann machine is one problem where quantum annealing would be dramatically superior to classical digital computing.\nLearned approximate inference and predicting a rich posterior. If we stick to the idea of obtaining actual values of the latent variables (either through MAP, factorized variational inference or MCMC), then a promising path is based on learning approximate inference, i.e., optimizing a learned approximate inference mechanism so that it performs a better inference faster. This idea is not new and has been shown to work well in many settings. This idea was actually already present in the wake-sleep algorithm (Hinton et al., 1995; Frey et al., 1996; Hinton et al., 2006) in the context of variational inference for Sigmoidal Belief Networks and DBNs. Learned approximate inference is also crucial in the predictive sparse coding (PSD) algorithm (Kavukcuoglu et al., 2008). This approach is pushed further with Gregor and LeCun (2010b) in which the parametric encoder has the same structural form as a fast iterative sparse coding approximate inference algorithm. The important consideration in both cases is not just that we have fast approximate inference, but that (a) it is learned, and (b) the model is learned jointly with the learned approximate inference procedure. See also Salakhutdinov and Larochelle (2010) for learned fast approximate variational inference in DBMs, or Bagnell and Bradley (2009); Stoyanov et al. (2011) for learning fast approximate inference (with fewer steps than would otherwise be required by standard general purpose inference) based on loopy belief propagation.\nThe traditional view of probabilistic graphical models is based on the clean separation between modeling (defining the model), optimization (tuning the parameters), inference (over the latent variables) and sampling (over all the variables, and possibly over the parameters as well in the Bayesian scenario). This modularization has clear advantages but may be suboptimal. By bringing learning into inference and jointly learning the approximate inference and the \u201cgenerative model\u201d itself, one can hope to obtain \u201cspecialized\u201d inference mechanisms that could be much more efficient and accurate than generic purpose ones; this was the subject of a recent ICML workshop (Eisner, 2012). The idea of learned approximate inference may help deal with the first (purely com-\nputational) challenge raised above regarding inference, i.e., it may help to speed up inference to some extent, but it generally keeps the approximate inference parameters separate from the model parameters.\nBut what about the challenge from a huge number of modes? What if the number of modes is too large and/or these are too well-separated for MCMC to visit efficiently or for variational/MAP inference to approximate satisfactorily? If we stick to the objective of computing actual values of the latent variables, the logical conclusion is that we should learn to approximate a posterior that is represented by a rich multi-modal distribution. To make things concrete, imagine that we learn (or identify) a function f(x) of the visible variable x that computes the parameters \u03b8 = f(x) of an approximate posterior distribution Q\u03b8=f(x)(h) but where Q\u03b8=f(x)(h) \u2248 P (h | x) can be highly multi-modal, e.g., an RBM with visible variables h (coupled with additional latent variables used only to represent the richness of the posterior over h itself). Since the parameters of the RBM are obtained through a parametric computation taking x as input,21 this is really a conditional RBM (Taylor et al., 2007; Taylor and Hinton, 2009). Whereas variational inference is usually limited to a non-parametric approximation of the posterior,Q(h) (one that is analytically and iteratively optimized for each given x) one could consider a parametric approximate posterior that is learned (or derived analytically) while allowing for a rich multimodal representation (such as what an RBM can capture, i.e., up to an exponential number of modes).\nAvoiding inference altogether by learning to perform the required marginalization. We now propose to consider an even more radical departure from traditional thinking regarding probabilistic models with latent variables. It is motivated by the observation that even with the last proposal, something like a conditional RBM to capture the posterior P (h | x), when one has to actually make a decision or a prediction, it is necessary for optimal decision-making to marginalize over the latent variables. For example, if we want to predict y given x, we want to compute something like \u2211 h P (y | h)P (h | x). If P (h | x) is complex and highly multi-modal (with a huge number of modes), then even if we can represent the posterior, performing this sum exactly is out of the question, and even an MCMC approximation may be either very poor (we can only visit at most N modes with\n21 for many models, such as deep Boltzmann machines, or bipartite discrete Markov random fields (Martens and Sutskever, 2010), f does not even need to be learned, it can be derived analytically from the form of P (h | x)\n14\nN MCMC steps, and that is very optimistic because of the mode mixing issue) or very slow (requiring an exponential number of terms being computed or a very very long MCMC chain). It seems that we have not really addressed the original \u201cfundamental challenge with highly multi-modal posteriors\u201d raised above.\nTo address this challenge, we propose to avoid explicit inference altogether by avoiding to sample, enumerate, or represent actual values of the latent variables h. Instead, one can just directly learn to predict P (y | x), in the example of the previous paragraph. Hence the only approximation error we are left with is due to to function approximation. This might be important because the compounding of approximate inference with function approximation could be very hurtful (Kulesza and Pereira, 2008).\nTo get there, one may wish to mentally go through an intermediate step. Imagine we had a good approximate posterior Q\u03b8=f(x)(h) as proposed above, with parameters \u03b8 = f(x). Then we could imagine learning an approximate decision model that approximates and skips the intractable sum over h, instead directly going from \u03b8 = f(x) to a prediction of y, i.e., we would estimate P (y | x) by g(f(x)). Now since we are already learning f(x), why learn g(\u03b8) separately? We could simply directly learn to estimate \u03c0(x) = g(f(x)) \u2248 P (y | x).\nNow that may look trivial, because this is already what we do in discriminant training of deep networks or recurrent networks, for example. And don\u2019t we lose all the advantages of probabilistic models, such as, handling different forms of uncertainty, missing inputs, and being able to answer any \u201cquestion\u201d of the form \u201cpredict any variables given any subset of the others\u201d? Yes, if we stick to the traditional deep (or shallow) neural networks like those discussed in Section 2.1.22 But there are other options.\nWe propose to get the advantages of probabilistic models without the need for explicitly going through many configurations of the latent variables. Let xc be a subset of elements of x that are clamped, x\n\u2212c the rest and xv a subset of x\u2212c for which we have a prediction to make and \u201ctarget\u201d observation. We want to be able to sample from P (xv | xc). During training, for each observed subset s we want to maximize P (xs), or almost equivalently23 maximize P (xv | xc) for any partition (v, c) of s. The important requirement is that the same parameters be used to model all the predictions\n22 although, using something like these deep nets would be appealing because they are currently beating benchmarks in speech recognition, language modeling and object recognition 23 by generalized pseudo-likelihood\nP (xv | xc) for any choice of (v, c). For this purpose, we could specify a computation that maps the model parameters to a training criterion equivalent to maximizing logP (xv | xc). The form of this computation could be inspired by existing or novel inference mechanisms, as has been done for learned approximate inference. However, because the training criterion would be expressed in terms of the observed x, the interpretation of the latent variables as latent variables in P (x, h) becomes superfluous. In fact, because we start from an approximate inference scheme, if we train the parameters with respect to some form of input reconstruction (like generalized pseudo-likelihood), there is no guarantee that the original interpretation of the estimated posterior P (h | x) continues to be meaningful. What is meaningful, though, is the interpretation of the parameterized computational graph that produces P (xv | xc) for any (v, c) pair as a formal definition of the learned model of the data.\nThe approximate inference is not anymore an approximation of something else, it is the definition of the model itself. This is actually good news because we thus eliminate the issue that the approximate inference may be poor. The only thing we need to worry about is whether the parameterized computational graph that produces P (xv | xc) is rich enough (or may overfit) to capture the unknown data generating distribution, and whether it makes it easy or difficult to optimize the parameters. With the mean-field variational inference, the computational graph looks like a recurrent neural network converging to a fixed point, and where we stop the iterations after a fixed number of steps or according to a convergence criterion. Such a trained parametrized computational graph is used in the iterative variational approach introduced in Goodfellow et al. (2013a) for training and missing value inference in deep Boltzmann machines, with an inpainting-like criterion in which arbitrary subsets of pixels are predicted given the others (a generalized pseudo-likelihood criterion). It has also been used in a recursion that follows the template of loopy belief propagation to fill-in the missing inputs and produce outputs (Stoyanov et al., 2011). Although in these cases there are latent variables (e.g. the latent variables of the deep Boltzmann machine) that motivate the \u201ctemplate\u201d used for the learned approximate inference, what we propose here is to stop thinking about them as actual latent factors, but rather just as a way to parametrize this template for a question answering mechanism regarding missing inputs, i.e., the \u201cgeneric conditional prediction mechanism\u201d implemented by the recurrent computational graph that is trained to predict any subset of variables given any other subset. Although Goodfellow et al. (2013a) assume a factorial distribution across the predicted variables, we propose to investigate non-factorial\n15\nposterior distributions over the observed variables, i.e., in the spirit of the recent flurry of work on structured output machine learning (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005).\nWe can think of this parametrized computational graph as a family of functions, each corresponding to answering a different question (predict a specific set of variables given some others), but all sharing the same parameters. We already have examples of such families in machine learning, e.g., with recurrent neural networks or dynamic Bayes nets (where the functions in the family are indexed by the length of the sequence). This is also analogous to what happens with dropouts, where we have an exponential number of neural networks corresponding to different sub-graphs from input to output (indexed by which hidden units are turned on or off). For the same reason as in these examples, we obtain a form of generalization across subsets. Following the idea of learned approximate inference, the parameters of the question-answering inference mechanism would be taking advantage of the specific underlying structure in the data generating distribution. Instead of trying to do inference on the anonymous latent variables, it would be trained to do good inference only over observed variables or over high-level features learned by a deep architecture, obtained deterministically from the observed input.\nThe idea that we should train with the approximate inference as part of the computational graph for producing a decision (and a loss) was first introduced by Stoyanov et al. (2011), and we simply push it further here, by proposing to allow the computational graph to depart in any way we care to explore from the template provided by existing inference mechanism, i.e., potentially losing the connection and the reference to latent variables with a probabilistic interpretation. Once we free ourselves from the constraint of interpreting this parametrized question answering computational graph as corresponding to approximate inference involving latent variables, all kinds of architectures and parametrizations are possible, where current approximate inference mechanisms can serve as inspiration and starting points. It is quite possible that this new freedom could give rise to much better models. The important point is that this mechanism is trained to do well at question answering on the provided data, and that it is really a family of functions indexed by all the possible question/answer subsets, but sharing their parameters.\nTo go farther than Goodfellow et al. (2013a) and (Stoyanov et al., 2011) it would be good to go beyond the kind of factorized prediction common in variational and loopy belief propagation inference. One idea is to represent the estimated joint distribution of the predicted variables (given the clamped variables) by a powerful model such as an RBM or a regularized auto-encoder,\ne.g., as has been done for structured output predictions when there is complex probabilistic structure between the output variables (Mnih et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013).\nAlthough conditional RBMs have been already explored, conditional distributions provided by regularized auto-encoders remain to be studied. Alternatively, a denoising auto-encoder (whether it is shallow or deep) with masking noise24 is trained to perform something very similar to generalized pseudo-likelihood. Note that sampling algorithms based on Langevin or Metropolis-Hastings MCMC have already been proposed (Rifai et al., 2012b; Alain and Bengio, 2012; Bengio et al., 2012), for regularized auto-encoders25 and they could easily be adapted to conditional sampling by clamping the fixed inputs and (optionally, to increase representational capacity) by making the hidden unit biases an arbitrarily complex (but deterministic) functions of the observed inputs. These theoretical analyses and sampling methods for regularized auto-encoders have been performed for the case of continuous inputs with squared error, and remain to be generalized to discrete inputs.\nAs as refinement, and in the spirit of a long tradition of discriminatively oriented machine learning, when some of the observed variables y are of particular interest (because we often want to predict them), one would naturally present examples of the prediction of y given x more often to the learning algorithm than random subsets of observed variables. Hybrids of generative and discriminant training criteria have been very successful for RBMs (Larochelle and Bengio, 2008; Larochelle et al., 2012) and would make practical sense here as well.\nAll these ideas lead to the question: what is the interpretation of hidden layers, if not directly of the underlying generative latent factors? The answer may simply be that they provide a better representation of these factors, a subject discussed in the next section. But what about the representation of uncertainty about these factors? The author believes that humans and other animals carry in their head an internal representation that implicitly captures both the most likely interpretation of any of these factors (in case a hard decision about some of them has to be taken) and uncertainty about their joint assignment. This is of course a speculation. Somehow, our brain would be operating on implicit representations of the joint distribution between these explanatory fac-\n24 in which some of the inputs are set to 0 and the auto-encoder is trying to predict them, as well as the rest, in its reconstruction 25 These methods iterate between encoding, decoding, and injecting noise, with the possibility of rejecting poor configurations\n16\ntors, generally without having to commit until a decision is required or somehow provoked by our attention mechanisms (which seem related to our tendancy to verbalize a discrete interpretation). A good example is foreign language understanding for a person who does not master that foreign language. Until we consciously think about it, we generally don\u2019t commit to a particular meaning for ambiguous word (which would be required by MAP inference), or even to the segmentation of the speech in words, but we can take a hard decision that depends on the interpretation of these words if we have to, without having to go through this intermediate step of discrete interpretation, instead treating the ambiguous information as soft cues that may inform our decision. In that example, a factorized posterior is also inadequate because some word interpretations are more compatible with each other.\nTo summarize, what we propose here, unlike in previous work on approximate inference, is to drop the pretense that the learned approximate inference mechanism actually approximates the latent variables distribution, mode, or expected value. Instead, we only consider the approximate inference over observed variables (or of values of features computed from the observed variables at a higher level of a deep architecture) and we consider that this mechanism is itself the model, rather than some approximation, and we train it with a training criterion that is consistent with that interpretation. By removing the interpretation of approximately marginalizing over latent variables, we free ourselves from a strong constraint and open the door to any parametrized computation which has the requirement that its parameters can be shared across any question/answer subset.\nThis discussion is of course orthogonal to the use of Bayesian averaging methods in order to produce bettergeneralizing predictions, i.e., handling uncertainty due to a small number of training examples. The proposed methods can be made Bayesian just like neural networks have their Bayesian variants (Neal, 1994), by somehow maintaining an implicit or explicit distribution over parameters. A promising step in this direction was proposed by Welling and Teh (2011), making such Bayesian computation tractable by exploiting the randomness introduced with stochastic gradient descent to also produce the Bayesian samples over the uncertain parameter values."}, {"heading": "6 Disentangling", "text": ""}, {"heading": "6.1 Disentangling: The Challenge", "text": "What are \u201cunderlying factors\u201d explaining the data? The answer is not obvious. One answer could be that these\nare factors that can be separately controlled (one could set up way to change one but not the others). This can actually be observed by looking at sequential real-world data, where only a small proportion of the factors typically change from t to t + 1. Complex data arise from the rich interaction of many sources. These factors interact in a complex web that can complicate AI-related tasks such as object classification. If we could identity and separate out these factors (i.e., disentangle them), we would have almost solved the learning problem. For example, an image is composed of the interaction between one or more light sources, the object shapes and the material properties of the various surfaces present in the image. It is important to distinguish between the related but distinct goals of learning invariant features and learning to disentangle explanatory factors. The central difference is the preservation of information. Invariant features, by definition, have reduced sensitivity in the directions of invariance. This is the goal of building features that are insensitive to variation in the data that are uninformative to the task at hand. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to determine a priori which set of features and variations will ultimately be relevant to the task at hand. Further, as is often the case in the context of deep learning methods, the feature set being trained may be destined to be used in multiple tasks that may have distinct subsets of relevant features. Considerations such as these lead us to the conclusion that the most robust approach to feature learning is to disentangle as many factors as possible, discarding as little information about the data as is practical.\nDeep learning algorithms that can do a much better job of disentangling the underlying factors of variation would have tremendous impact. For example, suppose that the underlying factors can be \u201cguessed\u201d (predicted) from a simple (e.g. linear) transformation of the learned representation, ideally a transformation that only depends on a few elements of the representation. That is what we mean by a representation that disentangles the underlying factors. It would clearly make learning a new supervised task (which may be related to one or a few of them) much easier, because the supervised learning could quickly learn those linear factors, zooming in on the parts of the representation that are relevant.\nOf all the challenges discussed in this paper, this is probably the most ambitious, and success in solving it the most likely to have far-reaching impact. In addition to the obvious observation that disentangling the underlying factors is almost like pre-solving any possible task relevant to the observed data, having disentangled representations would also solve other issues, such as the issue of mixing between modes. We believe that it would also considerably reduce the optimization problems involved when new information arrives and has to be reconciled\n17\nwith the world model implicit in the current parameter setting. Indeed, it would allow only changing the parts of the model that involve the factors that are relevant to the new observation, in the spirit of sparse updates and reduced ill-conditioning discussed above."}, {"heading": "6.2 Disentangling: Solution Paths", "text": "Deeper Representations Disentangle Better. There are some encouraging signs that our current unsupervised representation-learning algorithms are reducing the \u201centanglement\u201d of the underlying factors26 when we apply them to raw data (or to the output of a previous representation learning procedure, like when we stack RBMs or regularized auto-encoders).\nFirst, there are experimental observations suggesting that sparse convolutional RBMs and sparse denoising auto-encoders achieve in their hidden units a greater degree of disentangling than in their inputs (Goodfellow et al., 2009; Glorot et al., 2011b). What these authors found is that some hidden units were particularly sensitive to a known factor of variation while being rather insensitive (i.e., invariant) to others. For example, in a sentiment analysis model that sees unlabeled paragraphs of customer comments from the Amazon web site, some hidden units specialized on the topic of the paragraph (the type of product being evaluated, e.g., book, video, music) while other units specialized on the sentiment (positive vs negative). The disentanglement was never perfect, so the authors made quantitative measurements of sensitivity and invariance and compared these quantities on the input and the output (learned representation) of the unsupervised learners.\nAnother encouraging observation (already mentioned in the section on mixing) is that deeper representations were empirically found to be more amenable to quickly mixing between modes (Bengio et al., 2013b). Two (compatible) hypotheses were proposed to explain this observation: (1) RBMs and regularized autoencoders deterministically transform27 their input distribution into one that is more uniform-looking, that better fills the space (thus creating easier paths between modes), and (2) these algorithms tend to discover representations that are more disentangled. The advantage of a higher-level disentangled representation is that a small MCMC step (e.g. Gibbs) in that space (e.g. flipping one high-level variable) can move in one step from one inputlevel mode to a distant one, e.g., going from one shape\n26 as measured by how predictive some individual features are of known factors 27 when considering the features learned, e.g., the P (hi = 1 | x), for RBMs\n/ object to another one, adding or removing glasses on the face of a person (which requires a very sharp coordination of pixels far from each other because glasses occupy a very thin image area), or replacing foreground and background colors (such as going into a \u201creverse video\u201d mode).\nAlthough these observations are encouraging, we do not yet have a clear understanding as to why some representation algorithms tend to move towards more disentangled representations, and there are other experimental observations suggesting that this is far from sufficient. In particular, Gulcehre and Bengio (2013) show an example of a task on which deep supervised nets (and every other black-box machine learning algorithm tried) fail, on which a completely disentangled input representation makes the task feasible (with a maxout network (Goodfellow et al., 2013b)). Unfortunately, unsupervised pre-training applied on the raw input images failed to produce enough disentangling to solve the task, even with the appropriate convolutional structure. What is interesting is that we now have a simple artificial task on which we can evaluate new unsupervised representation learning methods for their disentangling ability. It may be that a variant of the current algorithms will eventually succeed at this task, or it may be that altogether different unsupervised representation learning algorithms are needed.\nGeneric Priors for Disentangling Factors of Variation. A general strategy was outlined in Bengio et al. (2013c) to enhance the discovery of representations which disentangle the underlying and unknown factors of variation: it relies on exploiting priors about these factors. We are most interested in broad generic priors that can be useful for a large class of learning problems of interest in AI. We list these priors here: \u2022 Smoothness: assumes the function f to be learned is s.t. x \u2248 y generally implies f(x) \u2248 f(y). This most basic prior is present in most machine learning, but is insufficient to get around the curse of dimensionality. \u2022 Multiple explanatory factors: the data generating distribution is generated by different underlying factors, and for the most part what one learns about one factor generalizes in many configurations of the other factors. The objective is to recover or at least disentangle these underlying factors of variation. This assumption is behind the idea of distributed representations. More specific priors on the form of the model can be used to enhance disentangling, such as multiplicative interactions between the factors (Tenenbaum and Freeman, 2000; Desjardins et al., 2012) or orthogonality of the features derivative with respect to the input (Rifai et al.,\n18\n2011b, 2012a; Sohn et al., 2013). The parametrization and training procedure may also be used to disentangle discrete factors (e.g., detecting a shape) from associated continuous-valued factors (e.g., pose parameters), as in transforming auto-encoders (Hinton et al., 2011), spike-and-slab RBMs with pooled slab variables (Courville et al., 2011) and other pooling-based models that learn a feature subspace (Kohonen, 1996; Hyva\u0308rinen and Hoyer, 2000). \u2022 A hierarchical organization of explanatory factors: the concepts that are useful for describing the world around us can be defined in terms of other concepts, in a hierarchy, with more abstract concepts higher in the hierarchy, defined in terms of less abstract ones. This assumption is exploited with deep representations. Although stacking single-layer models has been rather successful, much remains to be done regarding the joint training of all the layers of a deep unsupervised model. \u2022 Semi-supervised learning: with inputs X and target Y to predict, given X , a subset of the factors explaining X\u2019s distribution explain much of Y , givenX . Hence representations that are useful for spelling out P (X) tend to be useful when learning P (Y | X), allowing sharing of statistical strength between the unsupervised and supervised learning tasks. However, many of the factors that explain X may dominate those that also explain Y , which can make it useful to incorporate observations of Y in training the learned representations, i.e., by semisupervised representation learning. \u2022 Shared factors across tasks: with many Y \u2019s of interest or many learning tasks in general, tasks (e.g., the corresponding P (Y | X, task)) are explained by factors that are shared with other tasks, allowing sharing of statistical strength across tasks, e.g. for multi-task and transfer learning or domain adaptation. This can be achieved by sharing embeddings or representation functions across tasks (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Bordes et al., 2013). \u2022 Manifolds: probability mass concentrates near regions that have a much smaller dimensionality than the original space where the data lives. This is exploited with regularized auto-encoder algorithms, but training criteria that would explicitly take into account that we are looking for a concentration of mass in an integral number directions remain to be developed. \u2022 Natural clustering: different values of categorical variables such as object classes are associated with separate manifolds. More precisely, the local variations on the manifold tend to preserve the value of a category, and a linear interpolation between examples of different classes in general involves going through a low density region, i.e., P (X | Y = i) for different i tend to be well separated and not overlap much. For example, this is exploited in the Manifold Tangent Classifier (Rifai et al., 2011b). This hypothesis is consistent with the idea that humans have named categories and classes because of such statistical structure (discovered by their brain and propagated by their culture), and machine learning tasks often involves predicting such categorical variables. \u2022 Temporal and spatial coherence: this prior introduced in Becker and Hinton (1992) is similar to the natural clustering assumption but concerns sequences of observations: consecutive (from a sequence) or spatially nearby observations tend to be easily predictable from each other. In the special case typically studied, e.g., slow feature analysis (Wiskott and Sejnowski, 2002b), one assumes that consecutive values are close to each other, or that categorical concepts remain either present or absent for most of the transitions. More generally, different underlying factors change at different temporal and spatial scales, and this could be exploited to sift different factors into different categories based on their temporal scale. \u2022 Sparsity: for any given observation x, only a small fraction of the possible factors are relevant. In terms of representation, this could be represented by features that are often zero (as initially proposed by Olshausen and Field (1996)), or more generally by the fact that most of the extracted features are insensitive to small variations of x. This can be achieved with certain forms of priors on latent variables (peaked at 0), or by using a non-linearity whose value is often flat at 0 (i.e., 0 and with a 0 derivative), or simply by penalizing the magnitude of the derivatives of the function mapping input to representation. A variant on that hypothesis is that for any given input, only a small part of the model is relevant and only a small subset of the parameters need to be updated. \u2022 Simplicity of Factor Dependencies: in good highlevel representations, the factors are related to each other through simple, typically linear, dependencies. This can be seen in many laws of physics, and is assumed when plugging a linear predictor on top of a learned representation."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "Deep learning and more generally representation learning are recent areas of investigation in machine learning and recent years of research have allowed to clearly identify several major challenges for approaching the performance of these algorithms from that of humans.

Although the study of deep learning has already led to impressive theoretical results, learning algorithms and breakthrough experiments, several challenges lie ahead. This paper proposes to examine some of these challenges, centering on the questions of scaling deep learning algorithms to much larger models and datasets, reducing optimization difficulties due to ill-conditioning or local minima, designing more efficient and powerful inference and sampling procedures, and learning to disentangle the factors of variation underlying the observed data. It also proposes a few forwardlooking research directions aimed at overcoming these challenges. 1 Background on Deep Learning Deep learning is an emerging approach within the machine learning research community. Deep learning algorithms have been proposed in recent years to move machine learning systems towards the discovery of multiple levels of representation. They have had important empirical successes in a number of traditional AI applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. See (Bengio, 2009; Bengio et al., 2013c) for reviews and Bengio (2013c) and the other chapters of the book (Montavon and Muller, 2012) for practical guidelines. Deep learning is attracting much attention both from the academic and industrial communities. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple, IBM and Baidu are investing in deep learning, with the first widely distributed products being used by consumers aimed at speech recognition. Deep learning is also used for object recognition (Google Goggles), image and music information retrieval (Google Image Search, Google Music), as well as computational advertising (Corrado, 2012). A deep learning building block (the restricted Boltzmann machine, or RBM) was used as a crucial part of the winning entry of a million-dollar machine learning competition (the Netflix competition) (Salakhutdinov et al., 2007; T\u00f6scher et al., 2009). The New York Times covered the subject twice in 2012, with front-page articles.1 Another series of articles (including a third New York Times article) covered a more recent event showing off the application of deep learning in a major Kaggle competition for drug discovery (for example see \u201cDeep Learning The Biggest Data Science Breakthrough of the Decade\u201d2. Much more recently, Google bought out 1 http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/science/scientists-see-advancesin-deep-learning-a-part-of-artificial-intelligence.html 2 http://oreillynet.com/pub/e/2538 (\u201cacqui-hired\u201d) a company (DNNresearch) created by University of Toronto professor Geoffrey Hinton (the founder and leading researcher of deep learning) and two of his PhD students, Ilya Sutskever and Alex Krizhevsky, with the press writing titles such as \u201cGoogle Hires Brains that Helped Supercharge Machine Learning\u201d (Robert McMillan for Wired, March 13th, 2013). The performance of many machine learning methods is heavily dependent on the choice of data representation (or features) on which they are applied. For that reason, much of the actual effort in deploying machine learning algorithms goes into the design of preprocessing pipelines that result in a hand-crafted representation of the data that can support effective machine learning. Such feature engineering is important but labor-intensive and highlights the weakness of many traditional learning algorithms: their inability to extract and organize the discriminative information from the data. Feature engineering is a way to take advantage of human ingenuity and prior knowledge to compensate for that weakness. In order to expand the scope and ease of applicability of machine learning, it would be highly desirable to make learning algorithms less dependent on feature engineering, so that novel applications could be constructed faster, and more importantly for the author, to make progress towards artificial intelligence (AI). A representation learning algorithm discovers explanatory factors or features. A deep learning algorithm is a particular kind of representation learning procedure that discovers multiple levels of representation, with higher-level features representing more abstract aspects of the data. This area of research was kick-started in 2006 by a few research groups, starting with Geoff Hinton\u2019s group, who initially focused on stacking unsupervised representation learning algorithms to obtain deeper", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
