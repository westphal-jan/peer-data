Introduction", "text": "The national education system defines education as conscious and plans some efforts to create a good learning atmosphere and learning process. Therefore, students can actively develop their potentials so they will have strong religious faith, self-control, strong personality, intellectual, ethics and skills for themselves, society, and country. In line with those purposes are four education visions by UNESCO (United Nation on Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization) in 21st century. Those are (1) learning how to learn, (2) learning how to do, (3) learning how to be, and (4) learning how to live together. In order to support the process, Ministry of Religious Affairs has been offering scholarships for students at UIN Sunan Kalijaga in a regular basis, including scholarships for students with high academic achievements. Some research on application of multi-attribute decision making (MADM) has been widely conducted. In its development, research on MADM is also focus on how the decision makers give their preferences on certain alternatives and criteria [1]. Typically, the decision makers gave numeric weighting preferences to make the computation easier. However, current linguistic preferences are also applied to simplify the decision makers in giving their opinions. For example, the value\nISSN: 1693-6930\nTELKOMNIKA Vol. 9, No. 1, April 2011 : 37 \u2013 46\n38\nof alternative A1 is \"very good\" in the criterion C1, while alternative A1 is \"moderate\" in criterion C2. The importance level of C1 is \"very high\", while criterion C2 has a \u201clow\u201d level of importance, and so on. If the preference is given linguistically, then fuzzy logic can be used to help solving the problem. Fuzzy logic is very effective to solve the MADM problem where the given data is ambiguous or presented linguistically [2]. In fact, there are a lot of decisions created in the fuzzy environment [3]. The MADM method is used to solve a case which has several alternatives and priority for various attributes. MADM technique is a popular technique and has widely been used in several fields, including: engineering, economics, managements, transportation planning, etc. Several approaches that have been developed are calculating the weights of MADM problems, such as the eigenvector method and ELECTRE. The paper described the formulation of weighting in MADM case with fuzzy decision matrix was generated by two people [4]. Fuzzy multi attribute decision making (FMADM) has been used to select future lecturer at Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Industrial Technology, Islamic University of Indonesia (UII) using genetic algorithm to find the value of attribute weights. The value is searched through subjective approach. After the weight of every alternative has been found, the grades were processed to determine optimal alternatives; those are the applicants who have been accepted as the future lecturer at Department of Computer Science UII. In addition, the FMADM has also been used to determine the best location for a warehouse (from several alternative locations), using genetic algorithms in finding the value of attribute weights [5], [6]. Fuzzy model is also used to select a project for research and development (R & D) with multi-criteria decision making. The project selection used several qualitative and quantitative criteria. The criteria include cost and some of the obtained advantages if the project was implemented. However, models produced by Ramadan [7] still can not be used in group.In order to anticipate a group assessment, Zhou et al. [8] implemented fuzzy logic in decision support system to assess project produced by students. The project is rated by more than one person with several fuzzy criteria. The best project is a project with the highest membership value. Another method for the decision support system is analytical hierarchy process (AHP) fuzzy. AHP fuzzy can help users to make decisions on both structured and semi structured problems [9]. In addition, [10] fuzzy analytical hierarchy process is also used to help make decisions on the process of multicriteria robot selection. Researchers [11] have described several procedures on a modified technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method so that the TOPSIS can also be used for a case of decision made in group or multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM). In this study, TOPSIS algorithm is used in FMADM to asses the eligibility of scholarship recipients and helping the decision maker to make a quick, accurate and objective decision. TOPSIS algorithm is used to evaluate the results of production processes related to environment. Data used in the algorithm is a crisp data so that the output is a quantitative data. The output data will be evaluated and used as an input for the next process [12]. TOPSIS method is suitable to solve the problem decision making by introducing quantity multiplication operation of triangular fuzzy number. A case study indicates that the method can be applied effectively with less information and the quantitative result is objective and reasonable [13]. Linear programming model for multi attribute group decision making (MAGDM) has been introduced by Xu [14]. The given preference information can be presented in these three distinct uncertain preference structures: interval utility values; interval fuzzy preference relations; and interval multiplicative preference relations. The format of preference information attributes in MAGDM is not uniform. Initially, data gathered from the decision makers with various formats. For that Xu [15] propose a method that can accommodate all of decision makers\u2019 proposals. Therefore, a research to develop an unified modeling language (UML) for Fuzzy TOPSIS multiple attribute decision making (FMADM) is needed to assess the eligibility of scholarship recipients and helping the decision maker to make a quick, accurate and objective decision."}, {"heading": "2.
