Introduction", "text": "A performance evaluation is a systematic and periodic process that assesses an individual organization\u2019s performance and productivity with respect to certain pre - established criteria and the objectives of the organization. It is generally applied to adhere to an organization's resources in order to accomplish maximum performance. The principal determinant of performance evaluation in an organization is its profit and loss. But, in case of educational institutions, performance evaluation deals with quality of education, assessment of students and employees, course curricula, various organizational policies, collaborative programs, industry tie-ups, infrastructure, etc.\nMost of the previous performance models did not take the full range of interested stakeholders into consideration and were not directly connected to strategic, quality, and financial management. A balanced scorecard approach was proposed by Cullen, Joyce et al., [12] to strengthen the necessity of managing rather than just monitoring performance. Simultaneously the paper strengthened the relevance to follow private sector models for performance evaluation to deal with the most prominent quality issues. Garretson[11], in his paper, emphasized students\u2019 mindset to take into consideration so many issues apart from normal classroom activities. He reinforces the importance of the expectations of key stakeholders in the education process. Avdjieva and Wilson [14] suggested higher education institutions are required to become learning organizations where internal stakeholders also interpret and access the quality of higher education provision. Baig, Basharat, Maqsood [15] proposed an economical maturity framework which helps the existing education process to improve. Manjula et al., [19] proposed a new capability maturity decision making model based on rough computing\nfor extracting key process areas and its relevance for the development of quality education. However, they failed to study the performance evaluation of institutions in each level. Acharjya and Ezhilarasi [10] discussed the ranking of institutions and the chief factors that influence the ranking. But, the ranking should be carried out on different level of institutions. They have not considered this factor into account.\nThe evolution and advancement of computers and computer aided technologies lead to revolutionary changes to performance evolution systems specially in discovering huge amount of data from several target institutions and in extracting knowledge from the data by processing them. But the extracted knowledge may not always useful to its purpose, rather frequently suffers from redundancy, inconsistency etc., and therefore is irrelevant. Many of the rudimentary techniques for performance evaluation are either crisp or statistical. Statistical validity is another limitation for quantifying the level of institutions. In addition to statistical validity majority of them fail with normal tests of reliability and validity. But real life situations involve with indiscernibility and both of these theories can not be applied to performance evaluation.\nFuzzy set [13] by Zadeh, rough set by Pawlak [23, 24], soft set by [7] etc., are all the fruits of assiduous research works to overcome the impediments of that indiscernibility and all these are successfully applied to many fields of computer science including knowledge discovery in database, computational intelligence, knowledge engineering, granular computing etc., [16, 17, 18, 20, 21] to derive knowledge in field of data analysis in which a mammoth amount of data is considered. Fuzzy set proposed by Zadeh [13] is an approach in which an element of a set belongs to the set to a degree k\n(0  k  1), where k is the membership value. The major drawback in this approach is lying in designing membership function as it requires expertise. In order to overcome this, the concept of rough set is built on the approximation of sets by a pair of sets, known as lower approximation and upper approximation which are defined in terms of equivalence relations. The lower approximation of a rough set comprises those elements of the universe which are certainly a member of the rough set. The upper approximation of a rough set consists of those elements in the universe which can possibly be classified as a member of the rough set. Further the equivalence relation is generalized to fuzzy proximity relation and rough set on fuzzy approximation space is studied by Tripathy and Acharjya [4, 8]. The introduction of fuzzy proximity relation generalizes indiscernibility to almost indiscernibility and rough set on fuzzy approximation space reduces to rough set on certain conditions. Again fuzzy proximity relation is extended to intuitionistic fuzzy proximity relation and rough set on intuitionistic fuzzy approximation space is studied by Tripathy and Acharjya [2, 9]. The different applications on these areas are explored by Tripathy and Acharjya [3, 9, 13]. In this paper, we focus on performance evaluation by using rough set on fuzzy approximation spaces, ordering rules and information entropy.\nThis paper uses the basic idea of rough set on fuzzy approximation space, ordering rules and information entropy to evaluate the performance of institutions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the basics of rough set on fuzzy approximation spaces. The proposed performance evaluation approach is presented in Sections 3. In Section 4, we analyze the performance of institutions according to their levels followed by a conclusion in Section 5."}, {"heading": "2. Fundamentals of Rough Set on Fuzzy Approximation Spaces", "text": "Rough set of Pawlak [23, 24] was developed as an alternative data analysis tool but subsequently emerged as a very important aspect in the areas of artificial intelligence,\nknowledge discovery, decision analysis, expert systems, etc. It can also deal with inexact, uncertain and vague datasets [18]. The basic philosophy of rough set is based on indiscernibility relation defined on a universe U. But indiscernibility relation based on equivalence relation is not always relevant to real life scenarios. Therefore it was necessary to make relations less stringent by excluding one or more requirements of equivalence relation and to make it more realistic. A fuzzy relation is more generalized than binary relation on a set U. Fuzzy proximity relation on a universal set U is much general and abundant in real life situations because of exclusion of transitivity relation. So, fuzzy proximity relation has become more general, less stringent than equivalence relation and hence more practical in real life situations. Thus, the concept of fuzzy approximation space based on fuzzy proximity relation extends the efficiency and applications of rough sets on knowledge bases as discussed by Acharjya and Tripathy [4, 8].\nLet U be a universe. We define a fuzzy relation on U as a fuzzy subset of (U  U). A\nfuzzy relation R on U is a fuzzy proximity relation if ( , ) 1R x x  for all x U and\n( , ) ( , )R Rx y y x  for ,x y U . Let R be a fuzzy proximity relation on U. Then for a\ngiven [0,1] , we say that two elements x and y are   similar with respect to R if\n( , )R x y  and we write xR y or ( , )x y R . Two elements x and y in U are said to be\n\u03b1\u2013identical denoted by ( )x R y if either x is   similar to y or x is transitively\n  similar to y, that is, there exists a sequence 1 2 3, , , ... , nu u u u in U such that 1 1 2 2 3, , , ...... , .nxR u u R u u R u u R y    If x and y are   identical with respect to fuzzy proximity relation R, then we write ( )x R y , where the relation ( )R  for each fixed\n[0,1] is an equivalence relation on U. The pair (U,R) is called a fuzzy approximation\nspace. The rough set of X, in the generated approximation space (U, ( )R  ) is denoted by\n( X  , X ) and is defined with respect to *R , the family of equivalence classes of ( )R  .\nThe   lower approximation of X, X  and   upper approximation of X, X are defined as follows:\n*{ : and }X Y Y R Y X    (1)\n*{ : and }X Y Y R Y X      (2)\nX is said to be \u03b1-discernible if and only if X X   and X is said to be \u03b1-rough if\nX X   ."}, {"heading": "2.1. Almost Indiscernibility Relation", "text": "An information system provides all available information and knowledge about the objects under certain conditions. Objects are only perceived by using a finite number of properties without considering any semantic relationship between attribute values of a particular attribute. So trivial equality relation on values of attributes was used to do quantitative analysis as discussed in standard rough set theory [22]. But, attribute values are not usually exactly identical rather almost identical in real life situations. So Pawlak\u2019s idea of indiscernibility relation is generalized to almost indiscernibility relation which is the ground of rough set on fuzzy approximation space as discussed in the previous section.\nLet U be the universe and A be a set of attributes. With each attribute a A we\nassociate a set of values aV which is called the domain of a. The pair ( , )S U A is\ntermed an information system. Let B  A. For [0,1] , we define a binary relation\n( )BR  on U defined by ( )BxR y if and only if ( ) ( ) ( )x a R y a for all a B where\n( ) ax a V denotes the value of x in a. It can be proved that the relation ( )BR  is an\nequivalence relation on U. It is also noticed that ( )BR  is not exact indiscernibility\nrelation defined by Pawlak, rather it can be considered as an almost indiscernibility\nrelation on U. The almost indiscernibility relation ( )BR  reduces to Pawlak\u2019s exact\nindiscernibility relation when 1  and thus it generalizes Pawlak\u2019s indiscernibility\nrelation. The family of all equivalence classes of ( )BR  i.e., the partition generated by\nB for [0,1] is denoted by / ( )BU R  . If ( , ) ( )Bx y R  , then we say that x and y are\n  indiscernible. These are the basic building blocks of rough set on fuzzy\napproximation space."}, {"heading": "2.2. Ordered Information System", "text": "The basis of data mining is to acquire knowledge by classifying objects. In the\nprevious section, we have mentioned about an information system and the almost\nindiscernibility relation that is used in classification. But, in real life situations, we may\nface many problems that are not simply classification. One such type of problems is the\nordering of objects and its attribute values under certain consideration. An information\nsystem is defined as a quadruple ( , , , )a aI U A V f where U is a finite nonempty set of\nobjects called the universe, A is a finite nonempty set of attributes, aV is a nonempty set\nof values for a A , :a af U V is an information function.\nConsider the sample information system given in Table 1. Here, we have A =\n{Configure price (cp), Weight (w), Battery life (bl), Battery replace ability (br), HDD\nspeed (hs), Optical drive (od)} and CpV = {$1800, $1500, $2000, $1860, $2100}.\nLikewise we have WV ={3lbs., 3.97lbs., 2.4lbs., 4lbs., 2.7lbs.}, BlV = {5 hours, 3 hours, 8\nhours, 2.5 hours}, BrV = {Yes, No}, HsV = {4200 rpm, 5400 rpm}, and OdV = {Yes, No}.\nAn ordered information system is defined as { , { : }}aOIS I a A  where, I is a standard\ninformation system and a is an order relation on attribute a A . An ordering of values of a\nparticular attribute a naturally induces an ordering of objects:\n{ } ( ) ( )a a a ax y f x f y (3)\nwhere, { }a denotes an order relation on U induced by the attribute a. An object ix is\nranked ahead of object jx if and only if the value of ix on the attribute a is ranked\nahead of the value of jx on the attribute a. For example, information system given\nabove in Table 1 becomes order information system on introduction of the following\nordering relations:\n: 2100 2000 1860 1800 1500Cp\n: 4 3.97 3 2.7 2.4W\n: 8 5 3 2.5Bl\n: Yes NoBr\n: 5400 4200Hs\n: Yes NoOd\nFor a subset of attributes ,B A an object ix is ranked ahead of jx if and only if ix\nis ranked ahead of jx according to all attributes in B, i.e.,\n( ) ( ) B a a a x y f x f y a B  \n( ) ( ) { } a a a a a B a B f x f y      \nThe above definition is a straightforward generalization of the standard definition of\nequivalence relations in rough set theory, where the equality relation is used."}, {"heading": "3. Proposed Evaluation Index System", "text": "In this section, we propose evaluation index system that can be used to access the\nperformance evaluation of all the educational institutions in the universe for any level\nproposed in the model. There are many maturity hierarchical models developed and\nanalyzed by different researchers [1, 5, 15]. Some of these models are used in obtaining\nrank of the institutions. But, they are lacking in obtaining performance evaluation of\ninstitutions. Many authors proposed a list of quantitative and qualitative matrices that\ncan be used to access the rank of any institutions, such as intellectual capital,\ninfrastructure facility, placement performance, student satisfaction, international\nlinkage etc. The proposed evaluation index system, as shown in Figure 1, is divided into\nthree layers such as objective layer, standard layer and metric layer. The standard layer\ncontains four primary evaluation indexes such as level 1, level 2, level 3 and level 4.\nLiterature and numerical values based on different levels were collected and studied.\nThese parameters forms the metric set for our analysis. The metric set consisting of\nthese secondary evaluation indexes form the metric layer. The metric set that plays a\nvital role in performance evaluation and the notations that are used in our analysis are\ngiven in Table 2.\ncontains data about the universe U, and the attributes (metric). Our objective is to measure the\nperformance of educational institutions that will help us in identifying good institutions in\neach level. Further analysis can be done as discussed by the author [19] to obtain the rank of\nthe institutions for each level.

An Empirical Study on Performance Evaluation", "text": "In this section, we demonstrate how the above concept can be applied to real life situation. We consider the example in which we evaluate the performance of an institution in a group of institutions. In the Table 3 given below, we consider few secondary evaluation indexes to evaluate the performance of an institution; their possible range of values and a fuzzy proximity relation which characterized the relationship between secondary evaluation indexes. The institution with high score in each secondary evaluation indexes becomes an ideal case for better performance. But, such type of cases is rare in practice. So, an institution may not excel in all the secondary evaluation indexes in order to get top position in each level. However, out of these secondary evaluation indexes, some may have greater influence on the evaluation than the others. For different values of membership function , these secondary evaluation indexes may be different. In fact, if we decrease the value of  , more and more number of secondary evaluation indexes shall become indispensable. The membership functions have been designed such that their values should lie in [0, 1] and also these functions must be symmetric.\nNow, we define a fuzzy proximity relation ( , ) j k R i i in order to identify the almost\nindiscernibility among the objects j i and k i , where\n| |\n( , ) 1 Range\nj ki i\nj k\nV V R i i    (8)\nThe institutes can be judged by the outputs which are produced. The quality of the output can be judged by the placement performance of the institute and is given the highest weight with a score 385 which is around 21% of total weight. To produce the quality output the input should be of high quality. The major inputs for an institute are intellectual capital and infrastructure facilities for providing quality education. Accordingly the scores for intellectual capital and infrastructure facility are fixed as 250 and 200 respectively that are 12% and 11% of total weight. The study expense in general is from 1 Lakh to 6 Lakhs in Indian Rupee. The student placed in the company is expected to serve the company up to their expectation, i.e., the student shall meet the recruiter\u2019s satisfaction which is given a score of 180 which is around 9% of the total weight. At the same time student\u2019s satisfaction and extra curricular activities, which play a vital role for prospective students, are given scores 60 and 80 respectively of weights 4% and 6% of the total weight. Technical and financial aids, which is essential at the growth level, is given a score 70 which is around 5% of total weight. Similarly, to check the performance of institutions at higher level, the secondary evaluation indexes such as international linkage, industry institute interface, research consultancy and extension, and maturity and stability have been given scores 200, 90, 200 and 60 respectively of weights 10%, 8%, 10% and 4% of the total weight. However, out of these secondary evaluation indexes, some indexes may have greater influence than the rest. But, the index values of these secondary evaluation indexes obtained are almost indiscernible and hence can be classified by using rough set on fuzzy approximation space [4] and ordering rules. In view of the length of the paper and to make our analysis simple, we consider a small universe of 10 institutions and the information pertaining to them are presented in the Table 4. We keep the identities of the institutions confidential as they do not affect our analysis. The data collected is considered to be the representative figure and tabulated below in Table 4."}, {"heading": "4.1. Results and Analysis", "text": "algorithm for the empirical study taken under consideration. A target dataset for analysis as\nshown in Table 4 is considered. We have designed fuzzy proximity relations based on the\nsecondary evaluation indexes and computed the almost similarity between them.

We obtain categorical classes on imposing order relation on\nthis classification. Considering the length of the paper, we compute the performance of\ninstitutions according to the secondary evaluation indexes at level 1. The fuzzy proximity\nrelations , 1, 2, 3, 4iR i  corresponding to the attributes IC, IF, PP and Fee are given in tables\n5, 6, 7 and 8 respectively. Let 5R be the relation corresponding to the attribute CC.\nthat 1 1 1( , ) 1R i i  ; 1 1 3( , ) 0.988R i i  ; 1 1 6( , ) 0.992R i i  ; 1 1 10( , ) 0.952R i i  ; 1 2 2( , ) 1R i i  ;\n1 2 4( , ) 0.88R i i  ; 1 2 5( , ) 0.868R i i  ; 1 2 7( , ) 0.864R i i  ; and 1 2 9( , ) 0.920R i i  .

The values of the secondary evaluation index fee are classified into a single category such as very good. Similarly, the values of secondary evaluation index CC are classified into three categories namely very good, good and average. Therefore according to step 3, we use a comment set  = {Very good, Good, Average} and the corresponding grades are set to be {3, 2, 1}. Thus, the ordered information system for level 1 of the small universe of institutions is given below in Table 9.\nLet us consider A = {IC, IF, PP, Fee, CC}.

From the above analysis, it is clear that the attribute\n15 a is redundant and the weighting coefficient of performance evaluation index of other\nattributes are calculated as: 14 0.405aw  and 16 0.595aw  . So we obtain the performance\nevaluation values ( rW ) for level 4 of the ten institutions which are shown in Table 13.\naccording to the evaluation index system shown in Figure 1. According to level 1, institutions\n1 3 6 8, , ,i i i i and 10i outperform others, and institutions 7i and 9i are inefficient in overall\nperformance in terms of level 1. Secondly, institutions 1 3,i i and 6i outperform others, and\ninstitutions 5i and 7i are inefficient in overall performance in terms of level 2. Thirdly, in\nlevel 3, institutions 1i and 6i outperform others, and institutions 4 8,i i and 10i are inefficient\nin overall performance in terms of level 3. Finally, in level 4, institution 6i has better\nperformance than others due to the highest research, consultancy and extension (RCE)."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion and Future Extension", "text": "In this paper, we consider the issues of performance evaluation approach for educational institutions in various levels. We have also focused on effectiveness and fairness in the design of evaluation approach. We proposed a rough computing based performance evaluation approach for educational institutions. This approach consists of a three layer evaluation index system and uses rough set on fuzzy approximation space with ordering, information entropy to explore the evaluation index data. We achieve the performance evaluation for educational institutions through the proposed approach. An empirical study is taken into consideration to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed research. In addition, our future work aims at attaining chief secondary evaluation indexes affecting the decisions at each level. We also aim to establish a modularized and user friendly computer evaluation system to access the performance of educational institutions."}], "references": [{"title": "Software process maturity and certification", "author": ["A.
