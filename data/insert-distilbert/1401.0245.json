In this paper, the author present s the review of past work that has been carried out by various researchers based on development of expert systems for the diagnosis of cardiac disease Keywords: Expert System, Myocardial Infarction, coronary\nartery\nINTRODUCTION Expert System is computer software application which has the ability to replicate the thinking and reasoning capacity of human-being based on some facts and rules presented to it. Today expert systems have been used in all most all the fields to assist the users in decision making. They act like experts and provide the expertise decision and assistance for all the fields where human expatriation and complex decision making is required, like medical diagnosis, expert decision making, policy making, estimating strategies, analysis etc. The use of expert system in medical diagnosis started since early 70\u2018s when MYCIN, an expert system for identifying bacteria causing diseases was developed at Stanford University. Onwards then, various expert systems like Internist \u2013 I, CADUCEUS etc. Have been developed. The goal of such an expert system is to aid the medical experts in making diagnosis of certain diseases or help the ordinary people to diagnose the disease themselves. Myocardial infarction (MI) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack or IM, occurs when one or more coronary arteries become suddenly blocked, resulting in heart muscle death. And results from the interruption of blood supply to a part of the heart, causing heart cells to die. This is most commonly due to occlusion (blockage) of a coronary artery following the rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque, which is an unstable collection of lipids (cholesterol and fatty acids) and white\nblood cells (especially macrophages) in the wall of an artery. The resulting ischemia (restriction in blood supply) and ensuing oxygen shortage, if left untreated for a sufficient period of time, can cause damage or death (infarction) of heart muscle tissue (myocardium). Expert System for Myocardial infarction is a knowledge-based system capable of making multiple diagnoses in myocardial infarction. Expert System for Myocardial infarction is designed for a personal computer, which can provide assistance in the diagnosis of Myocardial Infarction and can demonstrate the reliability of a microcomputer-based expert system for medical diagnosis in this type of craniological disease. Today there is need of developing The Expert System for diagnosis of Myocardial infarction because this Heart disease is the leading cause of death today, and causing about million deaths per year in the Society. It is the most common heart diseases and is familiar as \u2015HEART ATTACK\u2016, The Cardiology has estimated that there is shortage of specialists, and the worrying fact is that the most of electrocardiograms are analyzed by general practitioners or lab experts. Implementation of The Expert System for Myocardial infarction will aim to have a direct impact on unnecessary visits to the cardiologist by effectively and efficiently decentralizing decision-making, will geared up effective interaction between patients, general practitioners and cardiologists and also this will be useful to train junior doctors and will aim to achieve a satisfactory solution to Physicians and General Practitioner\u2018s.\nREVIEW OF PREVIOUS RESEARCH WORK:\nE.P.Ephzibah, Dr. V. Sundarapandian (An International Journal (CSEIJ), Vol.2, No.1, February 2012) This paper is based on the heart disease diagnosis in patients\nwith the help of evolutionary techniques like genetic\nalgorithms, Fuzzy rule based expert system and Neural\nnetworks. This expert system will help the doctors to arrive at\nwww.ijcsit.com 5315\na conclusion about the presence or absence of heart disease in patients. This is an enhanced system that accurately classifies the presence of the heart disease. It is proved that the generated neuro-fuzzy rule based classification system is capable of diagnosing the heart disease in an effective and efficient method than any other classifiers."}, {"heading": "Tilotma Sharma, , Sumit Jain:", "text": "(ISSN 2250-2459, Volume 2, Issue 1, January 2012) In this paper, biomedical, agricultural, and automobile areas come under diagnosis and troubleshooting using ES that performs all the necessary data manipulation as a human expert would do. Others areas uses different techniques like fuzzy logic, rule-based reasoning, CLIPS etc. which actually comes under decision and planning area of ES. No matter which area of business one is engaged in, ES can fulfill the need of higher productivity and reliability of decisions. Everyone can find an application potential in the field of ESs. Expert Systems can actually help to create opportunities for new job areas. In order to be considered useful and acceptable ESs must be able to explain their knowledge of the domain and the reasoning processes they employ to produce results and recommendations. Expert systems are an example of symbolic paradigm, the other major paradigm is the connectionist paradigm that has led to the development of Neural Network Technology. Ahmad A.

More than10 types of neurological diseases can be diagnosed and treated by this system. It is rule-based expert system, assisting Neurologists, medical students doing specialization in neurology, researchers as well as neurological patients having computer know-how. It helps the patients to get the required advice about the different disorders attack to them due to their nervous system disorders. The expert rules were developed on the symptoms of each type of neurological disease, and they were presented using decision tree and inferred using backward-chaining method.

In this rule-based expert system, patient\u2018s heart rate and the wave characteristics of the ECG are considered. With these \u2017facts\u2018, rules are framed and a rule base is developed in consultation with experts. An inference engine in the expert system uses these inputs and the rule base to identify any abnormality in the patient\u2018s heart. A unique feature of the proposed system is storing the post diagnostic information in a database. That is, information about a patient diagnosed by this system is stored and can be retrieved later date-wise. The user can also input his comments or suggestions for improvement or correction, which can later be incorporated in the system after validation by experts.

Fotiadis (IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 54, NO. 11, NOVEMBER 2007) In the proposed methodology, the initial crisp set of rules are determined by experts. Starting from a crisp set of rules and then transforming it into a fuzzy model allows this methodology to be applied in cases where the initial set of rules is strictly crisp. Based on this feature, an alternative is to extract rules from the data, using a data mining technique, instead of a knowledge-based origin of the initial set of rules.\nIn this case, the methodology would be fully automated, data www.ijcsit.com 5317\ndriven, but the knowledge introduced from the experts through the initial set of rules, would be lost. Furthermore, hybrid approaches, combining to expert\u2018s knowledge and data-mined rules are also applicable. In this context, also the ability to automatically predetermine some of the fuzzy model\u2018s basic aspects, such as the fuzzy membership function and the Tnorm and Snorm definitions based on the natural characteristics of the problem, is a significant field of research. Another important feature is that the gradient is available for some of the fuzzy models; this feature can lead to the use of more efficient optimization methods, which take advantage of the first derivative information.

Abdel-Badeeh M. Salem, Mohamed Roushdy and Rania A. HodHod : (AIML Journal, Volume (5), Issue (1), March, 2005) In this paper, a case-based medical expert system prototype that supports diagnosis of four heart diseases was developed. Knowledge structure was represented via a formalism of cases. The system used two different techniques for the retrieval process; induction and nearest-neighbor techniques. The later technique was adapted to K-nearest neighbor to overcome the problem of obtaining more than one diagnosis for an input case. The results indicate that the nearest neighbor is better than the induction strategy, where the retrieval accuracy were100% and 53.8% respectively The nearest neighbor strategy was verified by conducting several tests in order to measure retrieval accuracy, retrieval consistency, case duplication and the overall system performance. Cardiologists evaluate the system performance by testing it practically for 13 new cases where the system succeeded in estimating the correct diagnosis. For future work, more cases will be added to the case memory and it will be clinically tested. Marcin Grabowski, Krzysztof J.
