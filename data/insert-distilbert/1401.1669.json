In the theory, information compression is the mechanism both for the learning and organisation of knowledge and for pattern recognition, reasoning, problem-solving, and more.\nIn the SP theory, all kinds of knowledge are represented with patterns: arrays of atomic symbols in one or two dimensions. A key part of the system\nis a concept of multiple alignment, like that shown in Figure 2.1\nThe SP theory is realised in a computer model, SP70, which may be regarded as a first version of the SP machine. It is envisaged that the SP computer model will provide the basis for the development of a high-parallel, open-source version of the SP machine, as shown schematically in Figure 3. This will be a means for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system and to create new versions of it.\n1The concept of multiple alignment in the SP system ([14, Section 4]; [10, Section 3.4]) is borrowed from that concept in bioinformatics, but with important differences.\nThe SP system provides a model for several aspects of computing and cognition, including unsupervised learning, concepts of computing, aspects of mathematics and logic, the representation of knowledge, natural language processing, pattern recognition, several kinds of reasoning, information storage and retrieval, planning and problem solving, and aspects of neuroscience and of human perception and cognition [14, 10].\nThere is a relatively full account of the SP system in [10], an extended overview in [14], an account of its existing and expected benefits and applications in [15], a description of its foundations in [12], and an introduction to the system in [13]. There is more information in www.cognitionresearch.org/sp.htm."}, {"heading": "3 Unsupervised learning", "text": "\u201cWhile traditional computers must be programmed by humans to perform specific tasks, cognitive systems will learn from their interactions with data and humans and be able to, in a sense, program themselves to perform new tasks.\u201d [3, p. 7].\nThe SP programme derives in part from earlier research developing computer models of language learning.2\nAt a fundamental level\u2014compression of information via the matching and unification of patterns\u2014the SP computer model works in the same way as the earlier models of language learning. Like the earlier models, the SP computer model is able to discover generative grammars from data, including segmental structure, classes of structure, and abstract patterns.\nBut in developing the SP system, a radical reorganisation has been needed to meet the goal of simplifying and integrating concepts across artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, and human perception and cognition. Unlike the earlier models, multiple alignment is central in the workings of the SP computer model, including unsupervised learning. A bonus of the new structure is potential for the unsupervised learning of class hierarchies, part-whole hierarchies, and discontinuous dependencies in data.\nThe emphasis on unsupervised learning in the SP programme of research is because of evidence that human learning, including the learning of natural languages, does not depend on the provision of a \u2018teacher\u2019, or anything equivalent\u2014although such assistance may be helpful.\nA strength of the SP system is that it can discover significant entities, classes of entity, and other structures in data, not merely statistical asso-\n2See bit.ly/JCd6jm.\nciations between pre-established structures. An important idea in the SP programme is the \u2018DONSVIC\u2019 principle [14, Section 5.2]: the conjecture, supported by evidence, that information compression is the key to the discovery of \u2018natural\u2019 structures, meaning the kinds of things that people naturally recognise, such as words, objects, and classes of objects.\nLearning in the SP system has much of the flavour of:\n\u201c[building and maintaining] a giant jigsaw puzzle on the fly, making connections between newly acquired data and older information.\u201d [3, p. 55].\nand of:\n\u201c... finding many needles in a field full of haystacks, combining those needles, then searching the smaller but still substantial collection for the needles made of gold\u2014the truly valuable slivers of insight.\u201d [3, p. 56]."}, {"heading": "4 Big data", "text": "\u201cThe emergence of social networking, sensor networks, and huge storehouses of business, scientific, and government records creates an abundance of information tech-industry insiders call \u2018big data\u2019. ... This digital universe is growing at about 60 percent each year.\u201d [3, p. 5].\n\u201cWe need a new generation of data storage, management, and analytics tools that will improve our ability to gather, meld, and make sense of huge amounts of data and, in some cases, to perform a complex ballet of tasks in real time.\u201d [3, p. 45].\nThe SP system may assist in the management and analysis of big data in four main ways:\n\u2022 Helping to overcome the problem of variety in big data.\n\u201cThe manipulation and integration of heterogeneous data from different sources into a meaningful common representation is a major challenge.\u201d [6, p. 76].3\n3See also the problem of variety described in [4] and [3, p. 45]\nThe versatility of SP patterns, within the multiple alignment framework, in the representation and processing of diverse kinds of knowledge ([14, Sections 5 to 13]; [10, Chapters 5 to 10]) makes them a contender for the role of \u201cmeaningful common representation\u201d or universal format for knowledge. There is potential for the translation of heterogeneous data into that universal format, for harmonisation in the representation of different kinds of knowledge, and for automatic structuring of knowledge via processes for unsupervised learning (Section 3).\n\u2022 Interpretation. In the interpretation of data, the SP system has capabilities that include such things as natural language processing, several kinds of reasoning, planning, and problem solving. It has several strengths in pattern recognition, where recognition may be achieved: at multiple levels of abstraction; with \u201cfamily resemblance\u201d or polythetic categories; in the face of errors of omission, commission or substitution in data; with the calculation of a probability for any given identification, classification or associated inference; with sensitivity to context in recognition; and with the seamless integration of pattern recognition with other aspects of intelligence\u2014reasoning, learning, problem solving, and so on ([14, Section 9]; [10, Chapter 6]).\n\u2022 Unsupervised learning. As outlined in Section 3, unsupervised learning is a key feature of the SP system. With big data, there is clear potential for the previously-mentioned DONSVIC principle: the discovery of natural structures via information compression [14, Section 5.2].\n\u2022 Information compression. Information compression is central in how the SP system works. Potential benefits with big data include:\n\u2013 Reducing the volume of data and thus facilitating its storage and management. In that connection, there are reasons to believe that the system may achieve higher levels of compression than conventional systems for information compression [15, Section 6.7].\n\u2013 By sending only \u2018code\u2019 and not \u2018grammar\u2019, there is potential for very substantial economies in the transmission of big data [15, Section 6.7.1]. There is more about this in Section 5.3.\n\u2013 It appears that information compression can mean substantial gains in computational efficiency, especially in the use of energy (Section 5).\n\u2013 In the SP system, information compression provides a key to the management of errors and uncertainty in data (Section 7).\n\u2013 Knowledge structures created by the system, including classinclusion hierarchies, part-whole hierarchies, and their integration [14, Section 9.1], may facilitate retrieval of information by serving, in effect, as hierarchical indices.\nHow the SP system may assist in the management and analysis of big data will be described more fully in a new article [7]."}, {"heading": "5 Computational efficiency via information", "text": "compression\n\u201c... we\u2019re reaching the limits of our ability to make [gains in the capabilities of CPUs] at a time when we need even more computing power to deal with complexity and big data. And that\u2019s putting unbearable demands on today\u2019s computing technologies\u2014mainly because today\u2019s computers require so much energy to perform their work.\u201d [3, p. 9].\n\u201cThe human brain is a marvel. A mere 20 watts of energy are required to power the 22 billion neurons in a brain that\u2019s roughly the size of a grapefruit. To field a conventional computer with comparable cognitive capacity would require gigawatts of electricity and a machine the size of a football field. So, clearly, something has to change fundamentally in computing for sensing machines to help us make use of the millions of hours of video, billions of photographs, and countless sensory signals that surround us. ... Unless we can make computers many orders of magnitude more energy efficient, we\u2019re not going to be able to use them extensively as our intelligent assistants.\u201d [3, p. 75, p. 88].\nIn the quest for greater efficiency in processing, especially energy efficiency, the SP system may make what is potentially a very substantial contribution via information compression (this section) and via data-centric computing (Section 6).\nSince information processing in the SP system means compression of information via the matching and unification of patterns, anything that increases the efficiency of searching for good full and partial matches between patterns will also increase the efficiency of information processing.\nIt appears that information compression can itself be a means of increasing the efficiency of searching, as described in the next two subsections.\nInformation compression may also yield economies in the transmission of information (Section 5.3, below)."}, {"heading": "5.1 Reducing the sizes of data to be searched and of", "text": "search terms\nAs described in [15, Section 6.7.2], if we wish to search a body of information, I, for instances of a pattern like \u201cTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union\u201d the efficiency of searching may be increased:\n\u2022 By reducing the size of I so that there is less to be searched. The size of I may be reduced by replacing all but one of the instances of \u201cTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union\u201d with a relatively short code like \u201cTFEU\u201d, and likewise other recurrent patterns. More generally, the size of I may be reduced via the compression processes in the SP system.\n\u2022 By searching with a short code like \u201cTFEU\u201d instead of a relatively large pattern like \u201cTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union\u201d. Other things being equal, a smaller search pattern means more efficient searching.\nWith regard to the second point, there is potential to cut out some searching altogether by \u201chard wiring\u201d the connection between each instance of a code (\u201cTFEU\u201d in this example) and the thing that it represents (\u201cTreaty on the Functioning of the European Union\u201d).

K. Zipf\u2019s Human Behaviour and the Principle of Least Effort [16].\nWhere does that statistical knowledge come from? In the SP theory, it flows directly from the central role of information compression in our perceptions, learning and thinking, and from the intimate relationship between information compression and concepts of prediction and probability [5].\nAlthough the SP computer model calculates probabilities for some purposes (see Section 7), it actually uses levels of information compression as a guide to search. Those levels are used, with heuristic search methods (including escape from \u2018local peaks\u2019), to ensure that searching is concentrated in areas where it is most likely to be fruitful [10, Sections 3.9, 3.10, and 9.2].

Any body of data, I, may be compressed by encoding it in terms a \u2018grammar\u2019 (G), provided that G contains the kinds of structures that are found in I (Section 7). Then I may be sent from A to B by sending only the \u2018encoding\u2019 (E). Provided that B has a copy of G, I may be recreated with complete fidelity by means of the SP system ([14, Section 4.5]; [10, Section 3.8]). Since E would normally be very much smaller than the I from which it was derived, it seems likely that there would be a net gain in efficiency, allowing for the computational costs of encoding and decoding.\nSince a copy of G must be transmitted to B, any savings will be relatively small if it is used only for the decoding of a single instance of E. But significant savings are likely if, as would normally be the case, one copy of G may be used for the decoding of many different instances of E, representing many different bodies of information."}, {"heading": "5.4 Potential gains in computational efficiency", "text": "No attempt has yet been made to quantify potential gains in computational efficiency from the compression of information, as described in Sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3, but they could be very substantial:\n\u2022 Since information compression is fundamental in the workings of the SP system, there is potential for corresponding savings in all parts and levels in the system.\n\u2022 The entire structure of knowledge that the system creates for itself is intrinsically statistical, with potential on many fronts for corresponding savings in computational costs and associated demands for energy.\nIt is anticipated that the proposed high-parallel version of the SP machine (Section 2) will provide a means of exploring these aspects of the system."}, {"heading": "6 Data-centric computing", "text": "\u201cWhat\u2019s needed is a new architecture for computing, one that takes more inspiration from the human brain.

It is envisaged that SP patterns would be realised with pattern assemblies\u2014groupings of neurons like those shown in the figure within broken-line envelopes.\nThe whole scheme is quite different from \u2018artificial neural networks\u2019 as they are commonly conceived in computer science.5 It may be seen as a development of Donald Hebb\u2019s [2] concept of a \u2018cell assembly\u2019, with more precision about how structures may be shared, and other differences.6\nIn SP-neural, the structure of knowledge is reflected directly in groupings of neurons and their interconnections, as shown in the figure. Although the details have not been worked out, it is envisaged that such things as pattern recognition would be achieved via the transmission of impulses between pattern assemblies, and via the transmission of impulses between neurons within each pattern assembly. In keeping with what is known about the workings of brains and nervous systems, it is likely that there would be important roles for both excitatory and inhibitory signals.\nIn short, neurons in SP-neural serve for both the representation and processing of knowledge, with close integration of the two\u2014in accordance with the concept of data-centric computing."}, {"heading": "6.2 Computing with light or chemicals", "text": "The SP concepts appear to lend themselves to computing with light or chemicals, perhaps by-passing such things as transistors or logic gates that have been prominent in the development of electronic computers [15, Section 6.10.6].7\nAt the heart of the SP system is a process of finding good full and partial matches between patterns. This may be done with light, with the potential advantage that light beams may cross each other without interference. Another potential advantage is that, with collimated light, there may be relatively small losses over distance\u2014although distances should probably be minimised to save on transmission times and to minimise the sizes of computing devices.

By contrast with Hebbian learning, the SP system, like a person, may learn from a single exposure to some situation or event. And, by contrast with Hebbian learning, it takes time to learn a language in the SP system because of the complexity of the search space, not because of any kind of gradual strengthening or \u201cweighting\u201d of links between neurons [10, Section 11.4.4].\n7\u201cThe most promising means of moving data faster is by harnessing photonics, the generation, transmission, and processing of light waves.\u201d [3, p. 93].\ncal/electronic version of SP-neural.

The enemy is uncertainty. In the past, since computing systems didn\u2019t handle uncertainty well, the tendency was to pretend that it didn\u2019t exist. Today, it is clear that that approach won\u2019t work anymore. So rather than trying to eliminate uncertainty, people have to embrace it.\u201d [3, pp. 50\u201351].\nThe SP system has potential in the management of errors and uncertainties in data. In summary:\n\u2022 Owing to the previously-mentioned close connection between information compression and concepts of prediction and probability, the whole system is inherently probabilistic. Every SP pattern has an associated frequency of occurrence. From that information, a probability may be derived for each multiple alignment and for each of what are normally several inferences that may be derived from each multiple alignment ([14, Section 4.4]; [10, Section 3.7 and Chapter 7]).9\n\u2022 Unsupervised learning via information compression provides a neat solution to the problem of \u201cdirty data\u201d in the learning of a natural language ([14, Section 5.3]; [8]): how it is that we can develop a keen sense of what does or does not belong in our native language or languages, despite the fact that most of the speech that children hear contains the kinds of haphazard errors that people make in talking, and in the face\n8See, for example, \u201cDNA computing\u201d, Wikipedia, bit.ly/1gfEP4p, retrieved 2013-12- 30.\n9Although the SP system is fundamentally probabilistic, it can, if required, be constrained to yield all-or-nothing results, much as in a conventional computer [10, Chapter 10].\nof evidence that language learning may be achieved without the benefit of error correction by a teacher, or anything equivalent.\nIn brief, the product of learning comprises a \u2018grammar\u2019 (G) and an \u2018encoding\u2019 (E) of the original data in terms of the grammar. The two together achieve lossless compression of the original data, including all the errors. But G, which may be seen to capture the essence of the target language, excludes everything which is rare\u2014which is mostly those haphazard errors that people make in speaking (these are rare individually, although collectively they are quite common). Anything that is a little more frequently-occurring than rare may acquire the status of linguistic irregularity\u2014such as \u2018bought\u2019 (not \u2018buyed\u2019) as the past tense of \u2018buy\u2019\u2014or it may be seen as a dialect form.\nThese principles apply to any kind of data, not just linguistic data.\n\u2022 In operations such as parsing natural language or pattern recognition, the SP system is robust in the face of errors of omission, of commission, or of substitution ([14, Section 4.2.2]; [10, Section 6.2.1]). In the same way that we can recognise things visually despite disturbances such as falling leaves or snow, or our own blinking (and likewise for other senses), the SP system can cope quite well with inputs that are not totally correct.\nAlthough there are advantages in using probabilities, the flipside\u2014for both people and machines\u2014is that mistakes can be made. We may bet on \u201cDancing Queen\u201d but find that \u201cKiss me Kate\u201d is the winner. In the same way that people can be fooled by a frequently-repeated lie, any probabilistic machine will be vulnerable to systematic distortions in data."}, {"heading": "8 Other possibilities", "text": "Outline here are some other aspects of the SP system, and how they may help to realise the possibilities described in Smart Machines."}, {"heading": "8.1 Medical diagnosis", "text": "\u201cOne of the next challenges for Watson is to help doctors diagnose diseases and assess the best treatments for individual patients.\u201d [3, p. 2].\nHow the SP system may assist with medical diagnosis is described in [9]."}, {"heading": "8.2 Processing streams of data", "text": "\u201cIncreasingly, vitally important insights can be gained from analyzing information that\u2019s on the move. ...

In the SP system, information compression and a concept of multiple alignment are centre stage. The system is designed to integrate such things as unsupervised learning, pattern recognition, probabilistic reasoning, and more. It may help to overcome the problem of variety in big data, it may serve in pattern recognition and in the unsupervised learning of structure in data, and it may facilitate the management and transmission of big data. There is potential, via information compression, for substantial gains in computational efficiency, especially in the use of energy. The SP system may help to realise data-centric computing, perhaps via a development of Hebb\u2019s concept of a \u2018cell assembly\u2019, or via the use of light or DNA for the processing of information. It has potential in the management of errors and uncertainty in data, in medical diagnosis, in processing streams of data, and in promoting adaptability in robots.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
