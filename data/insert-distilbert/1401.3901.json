Introduction", "text": "The ontologies at the core of the semantic web \u2014 as well as ontology languages such as RDF, OWL, and related Description Logics (DLs) \u2014 are founded on fragments of first-order logic and inherit strengths and weaknesses of this well-established formalism. Limitations include monotonicity, and the consequent inability to design knowledge bases (KBs) by describing prototypes whose general properties can be later refined with suitable exceptions. This natural, iterative approach is commonly used by biologists and calls for an extension of DLs with defeasible inheritance with overriding (a mechanism normally supported by object-oriented languages). Some workarounds have been devised for particular cases; however, no general solutions are currently available (Rector, 2004; Stevens, Aranguren, Wolstencroft, Sattler, Drummond, Horridge, & Rector, 2007). Another motivation for nonmonotonic DLs stems from the recent development of policy languages based on DLs (Uszok, Bradshaw, Jeffers, Suri, Hayes, Breedy, Bunch, Johnson, Kulkarni, & Lott, 2003; Finin, Joshi, Kagal, Niu, Sandhu, Winsborough, & Thuraisingham, 2008; Zhang, Artale, Giunchiglia, & Crispo, 2009; Kolovski, Hendler, & Parsia, 2007). DLs nicely capture role-based policies and facilitate the integration of semantic web policy enforcement with reasoning about semantic metadata (which is typically necessary in order to check policy conditions). However, in order to formulate standard default policies such as open and closed policies,1and support common policy language features such as authorization inheritance with exceptions (which is meant to facilitate incremental\n1. If no explicit authorization has been specified for a given access request, then an open policy permits the access while a closed policy denies it.\nc\u00a92011 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.\npolicy formulation), it is necessary to adopt a nonmonotonic semantics; Bonatti and Samarati (2003) provide further details on the matter.\nGiven the increasing size of semantic web ontologies and RDF bases, the complexity of reasoning is an influential factor that may either foster or prevent the adoption of a knowledge representation language. Accordingly, OWL2 introduces profiles that adopt syntactic restrictions (compatible with application requirements) in order to make reasoning tractable. Two of such profiles are based on the following families of DLs: DL-lite (Calvanese, De Giacomo, Lembo, Lenzerini, & Rosati, 2005), that formalizes RDFS, and EL (Baader, 2003; Baader, Brandt, & Lutz, 2005), that extensively covers important biomedical ontologies such as GALEN and SNOMED. Unfortunately, in general, nonmonotonic DL reasoning can be highly complex and reach NExpTimeNP and even 3- ExpTime (Donini, Nardi, & Rosati, 1997, 2002; Bonatti, Lutz, & Wolter, 2009). A natural question, in this context, is whether restrictions such as those adopted by DL-lite and EL help in reducing the complexity of nonmonotonic DL reasoning, too.\nAnswering this question is the main goal of this paper. We extensively investigate the complexity of reasoning in DL-lite and EL. The nonmonotonic semantics adopted is Circumscription (McCarthy, 1980), whose main appealing properties (discriminating Circumscription from other nonmonotonic DL semantics proposed in the literature) are summarized below:\n1. Circumscription is compatible with all the interpretation domains supported by classical DLs; there is no need for adopting a fixed domain of standard names;\n2. In circumscribed DLs, nonmonotonic inferences apply to all individuals, including those that are not denoted by any constants and are implicitly asserted by existential quantifiers;\n3. Circumscription naturally supports priorities among conflicting nonmonotonic axioms and can easily simulate specificity-based overriding.\nAs an attempt to simplify the usage of circumscribed DLs and simultaneously remove potential sources of computational complexity, we do not support the usage of abnormality predicates (McCarthy, 1986) in their full generality; we rather hide them within defeasible inclusions (Bonatti, Faella, & Sauro, 2009). Defeasible inclusions are expressions C vn D whose intuitive meaning is: an instance of C is normally an instance of D. Such inclusions can be prioritized to resolve conflicts. Priorities can be either explicit or automatically determined by the inclusion\u2019s specificity, i.e. a defeasible inclusion C1 vn D1 may override C2 vn D2 if C1 is classically subsumed by C2. In this framework, we prove that restricting the syntax to DL-lite inclusions suffices\u2014in almost all cases\u2014to reduce complexity to the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. On the contrary, circumscribed EL is still ExpTime-hard and further restrictions are needed to confine complexity within the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. Syntactic restrictions will be analyzed in conjunction with other semantic parameters, such as the kind of priorities adopted (explicit or specificity-based), and which predicates may or may not be affected by Circumscription (i.e., fixed and variable predicates, in Circumscription\u2019s jargon).\nThe paper is organized as follows: First, the basics of low-complexity description logics and their extension based on circumscription are recalled in Section 2 and Section 3, respectively. Then, some reductions that can be used to eliminate language features and work on simpler frameworks are illustrated in Section 4. After an undecidability result caused by fixed roles (Section 5), the paper focuses on variable roles: The complexity of circumscribed DL-liteR and EL/EL\u22a5 are investigated\nin Section 6 and Section 7, respectively. A section on related work and a final discussion conclude the paper."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "In DLs, concepts are inductively defined with a set of constructors, starting with a set NC of concept names, a set NR of role names, and (possibly) a set NI of individual names (all countably infinite). We use the term predicates to refer to elements of NC \u222a NR. Hereafter, letters A and B will range over NC, P will range over NR, and a, b, c will range over NI. The concepts of the DLs dealt with in this paper are formed using the constructors shown in Figure 1. There, the inverse role constructor is the only role constructor, whereas the remaining constructors are concept constructors. Letters C,D will range over concepts and letters R,S over (possibly inverse) roles.\nThe semantics of the above concepts is defined in terms of interpretations I = (\u2206I , \u00b7I). The domain \u2206I is a non-empty set of individuals and the interpretation function \u00b7I maps each concept name A \u2208 NC to a set AI \u2286 \u2206I , each role name P \u2208 NR to a binary relation P I on \u2206I , and each individual name a \u2208 NI to an individual aI \u2208 \u2206I . The extension of \u00b7I to inverse roles and arbitrary concepts is inductively defined as shown in the third column of Figure 1. An interpretation I is called a model of a concept C if CI 6= \u2205. If I is a model of C, we also say that C is satisfied by I.\nA (strong) knowledge base is a finite set of (i) concept inclusions (CIs) C v D where C and D are concepts, (ii) concept assertions A(a) and role assertions P (a, b), where a, b are individual names, P \u2208 NR, andA \u2208 NC, (iii) role inclusions (RIs)R v R\u2032. An interpretation I satisfies (i) a CI C v D if CI \u2286 DI , (ii) an assertion C(a) if aI \u2208 CI , (iii) an assertion P (a, b) if (aI , bI) \u2208 P I , and (iv) a RI R v R\u2032 iff RI \u2286 R\u2032I . Then, I is a model of a strong knowledge base S iff I satisfies all the elements of S. We write C vS D iff for all models I of S , I satisfies C v D.\nTerminologies are particular strong knowledge bases consisting of definitions, i.e. axioms such as A \u2261 C, that abbreviate the inclusions A v C and C v A. If a terminology T contains the above definition, then we say that A is defined in T and that C is the definition of A. Each A defined in T must have a unique definition. A concept name A directly depends on B (in T ) if B occurs in A\u2019s definition; moreover, A depends on B (in T ) if there is a chain of such direct dependencies leading from A to B. A terminology T is acyclic if no A depends on itself in T . Terminologies are conservative extensions, and the concept names defined in an acyclic terminology T can be\neliminated by unfolding them w.r.t. T , that is, by exhaustively replacing the concepts defined in T with their definition. For all expressions (i.e., concepts or inclusions) E, we denote with unf(E, T ) the unfolding of E w.r.t. T .\nThe logic DL-liteR (Calvanese et al., 2005) restricts concept inclusions to expressions CL v CR, where"}, {"heading": "CL ::= A | \u2203R R ::= P | P\u2212 CR ::= CL | \u00acCL", "text": "(as usual, \u2203R abbreviates \u2203R.>).

Finally, EL\u00acA denotes the extension where negation can be applied to concept names."}, {"heading": "3. Defeasible Knowledge", "text": "A general defeasible inclusion (GDI) is an expression C vn D whose intended meaning is: C\u2019s elements are normally in D.\nExample 3.1 (Bonatti et al., 2009) The sentences: \u201cin humans, the heart is usually located on the left-hand side of the body; in humans with situs inversus, the heart is located on the right-hand side of the body\u201d (Rector, 2004; Stevens et al., 2007) can be formalized with the EL\u22a5 axioms and GDIs:\nHuman vn \u2203has heart.\u2203has position.Left ; Situs Inversus v \u2203has heart.\u2203has position.Right ; \u2203has heart.\u2203has position.Left u \u2203has heart.\u2203has position.Right v \u22a5 .\n2\nA defeasible knowledge base (DKB) in a logicDL is a pair \u3008K,\u227a\u3009, where K = KS\u222aKD, KS is a strong DL KB, KD is a set of GDIs C vn D such that C v D is a DL inclusion, and \u227a is a strict partial order (a priority relation) overKD. In the following, byC v[n] D we denote an inclusion that is either classical or defeasible. Moreover, for a DKB KB = \u3008K \u222a T ,\u227a\u3009, where T is a (classical) acyclic terminology, we denote by unf(KB) = \u3008K\u2032,\u227a\u2032\u3009 the DKB where K\u2032 is the unfolding of all inclusions in K w.r.t. T , and, for all DIs \u03b4, \u03b4\u2032 in K, the relation unf(\u03b4, T ) \u227a\u2032 unf(\u03b4\u2032, T ) holds if and only if \u03b4 \u227a \u03b4\u2032.\nAs priority relation we shall often adopt the specificity relation \u227aK which is determined by classically valid inclusions. Formally, for all GDIs \u03b41 = (C1 vn D1) and \u03b42 = (C2 vn D2), let\n\u03b41 \u227aK \u03b42 iff C1 vKS C2 and C2 6vKS C1 .\nExample 3.2 The access control policy: \u201cNormally users cannot read project files; staff can read project files; blacklisted staff is not granted any access\u201d can be encoded with:\nStaff v User Blacklisted v Staff UserRequest v \u2203subj.User u \u2203target.Proj u \u2203op.Read StaffRequest v \u2203subj.Staff u \u2203target.Proj u \u2203op.Read UserRequest vn \u2203decision.{Deny} StaffRequest vn \u2203decision.{Grant} \u2203subj.Blacklisted v \u2203decision.{Deny} \u2203decision.{Grant} u \u2203decision.{Deny} v \u22a5 .\nStaff members cannot simultaneously satisfy the two defeasible inclusions (due to the last inclusion above). With specificity, the second defeasible inclusion overrides the first one and yields the intuitive inference that non-blacklisted staff members are indeed allowed to access project files. More formally, the subsumption\n\u2203subj.(Staff u \u00acBlacklisted) u \u2203target.Proj u \u2203op.Read v \u2203decision.{Grant}\nholds in all the models of the above knowledge base (as defined below). 2\nIntuitively, a model of \u3008K,\u227a\u3009 is a model of KS that maximizes the set of individuals satisfying the defeasible inclusions in KD, resolving conflicts by means of the priority relation \u227a whenever possible. In formalizing the notion of model, one should specify how to deal with the predicates occurring in the knowledge base: is their extension allowed to vary in order to satisfy defeasible inclusions? A discussion of the effects of letting predicates vary vs. fixing their extension can be found in the work of Bonatti, Lutz and Wolter (2006); they conclude that the appropriate choice is application dependent. So, in general, the set of predicates NC\u222aNR can be arbitrarily partitioned into two sets F and V containing fixed and varying predicates, respectively; we denote this semantics by Circ\u2217F .\nHowever, in Section 5 it is shown that fixed roles cause undecidability issues, so most of our results concern a specialized framework in which all role names are varying predicates, that is, F \u2286 NC. We use the notation CircF (rather than Circ\u2217F ) to indicate that F \u2286 NC.\nThe set F , the GDIs KD, and the priority relation \u227a induce a strict partial order over interpretations. As we move down the ordering we find interpretations that are more and more normal w.r.t. KD. For all \u03b4 = (C vn D) and all interpretations I let the set of individuals satisfying \u03b4 be:\nsatI(\u03b4) = {x \u2208 \u2206I | x 6\u2208 CI or x \u2208 DI} .\nDefinition 3.3 Let KB = \u3008K,\u227a\u3009 be a DKB. For all interpretations I and J , and all F \u2286 NC \u222aNR, let I <KB,F J iff:\n1. \u2206I = \u2206J ;\n2. aI = aJ , for all a \u2208 NI;\n3. AI = AJ , for all A \u2208 F \u2229 NC, and P I = PJ , for all P \u2208 F \u2229 NR;\n4. for all \u03b4 \u2208 KD, if satI(\u03b4) 6\u2287 satJ (\u03b4) then there exists \u03b4\u2032 \u2208 KD such that \u03b4\u2032 \u227a \u03b4 and satI(\u03b4 \u2032) \u2283 satJ (\u03b4\u2032) ;\n5. there exists a \u03b4 \u2208 KD such that satI(\u03b4) \u2283 satJ (\u03b4).\nThe subscript KB will be omitted when clear from context. Now a model of a DKB can be defined as a maximally preferred model of its strong (i.e. classical) part.\nDefinition 3.4 Let KB = \u3008K,\u227a\u3009 and F \u2286 NC \u222a NR. An interpretation I is a model of Circ\u2217F (KB) iff I is a (classical) model of KS and for all models J of KS, J 6<F I.\nRemark 3.5 This semantics is a special case of the circumscribed DLs introduced by Bonatti et al. (2006). The correspondence can be seen by (i) introducing for each GDI C vn D a fresh atomic conceptAb, playing the role of an abnormality predicate; (ii) replacingC vn D withCu\u00acAb v D; (iii) minimizing all the predicates Ab introduced above.\nIn order to enhance readability, we will use the following notation for the special cases in which all concept names are varying and the case in which they are all fixed: <var and Circvar stand for <\u2205 and Circ\u2205, respectively; <fix and Circfix stand respectively for <NC and CircNC . For a DKB KB = \u3008KS\u222aKD,\u227a\u3009, we say that an interpretation I is a classical model ofKB in case I is a model of KS.\nIn this paper, we consider the following standard reasoning tasks over defeasible DLs:\nKnowledge base consistency Given a DKB KB, decide whether Circ\u2217F (KB) has a model.\nConcept consistency Given a concept C and a DKB KB, check whether C is satisfiable w.r.t. KB, that is, whether a model I of Circ\u2217F (KB) exists such that CI 6= \u2205.\nSubsumption Given two concepts C, D and a DKB KB, check whether Circ\u2217F (KB) |= C v D, that is, whether for all models I of Circ\u2217F (KB), CI \u2286 DI .\nInstance checking Given a \u2208 NI, a concept C, and a DKB KB, check whether Circ\u2217F (KB) |= C(a), that is, whether for all models I of Circ\u2217F (KB), aI \u2208 CI .\nThe following example illustrates most of the above tasks as well as the main difference between Circvar and Circfix.\nExample 3.6 Consider the following simplification of Example 3.2:\nUser vn \u00ac\u2203decision.{Grant} Staff v User Staff vn \u2203decision.{Grant} BlacklistedStaff v Staff u \u00ac\u2203decision.{Grant} .\nExtend the knowledge base with the assertion Staff(John), and let the priority relation be\u227aK (i.e., priorities are determined by specificity). Denote the resulting knowledge base with KB. Due to the inclusion Staff v User, the GDI for Staff (third line) has higher priority than the GDI for User\n(first line). Therefore, in all models I of Circvar(KB), John belongs to \u2203decision.{Grant} and hence the following entailments hold:\nCircvar(KB) |= {John} v \u2203decision.{Grant} (subsumption) (1) Circvar(KB) |= \u2203decision.{Grant}(John) (instance checking) (2)\nInterestingly, John does not belong to BlacklistedStaff, because this is the only way of satisfying the top-priority GDI for Staff. Analogously, in all models I of Circvar(KB), John is the only member of Staff because this setting maximizes the number of individuals satisfying both GDIs (as all the individuals in \u00acStaff vacuously satisfy the GDI for Staff for all values of decision). More generally, as a side effect of the maximization of all satI(\u03b4), Circvar induces a sort of closedworld assumption over all concepts with exceptional properties (w.r.t. some larger concept). Consequently, BlacklistedStaff is not satisfiable w.r.t. KB, and the following subsumption holds:\nCircvar(KB) |= Staff v {John} . (3)\nOn the contrary, under Circfix, User and Staff may contain any number of individuals (other than zero) because Circfix is not allowed to change the extension of any atomic concept, even if this would satisfy more GDIs. Similarly, there exist models of Circfix(KB) where John does not belong to \u2203decision.{Grant} because John belongs to BlacklistedStaff and Circfix does not allow to change its extension to satisfy more GDIs. As a consequence, it can be easily verified that BlacklistedStaff is satisfiable w.r.t. Circfix(KB), and that (1), (2), and (3) do not hold if Circvar is replaced by Circfix. We only have inferences such as:\nCircfix(KB) |= User u \u00acStaff v \u00ac\u2203decision.{Grant} , (4) Circfix(KB) |= Staff u \u00acBlacklistedStaff v \u2203decision.{Grant} . (5)\n2\nNote that in Circvar one can obtain nominals (cf. Staff in (3)) without using nominals explicitly in the knowledge base. If other axioms do not interfere, then an assertion A(a) and a GDI A vn \u22a5 suffice to make A a singleton. This idea will be used in some reductions later on.\nThe next example deals with multiple inheritance, and in particular with parent concepts with conflicting properties.\nExample 3.7 Let KB consist of the axioms:\nWhale v Mammal u SeaAnimal Mammal vn \u2203has organ.Lungs\nSeaAnimal vn \u2203has organ.Gills \u2203has organ.Lungs u \u2203has organ.Gills v \u22a5 ,\nwhere the priority relation is specificity. Note that mammals and sea animals have conflicting default properties. In all models of Circvar(KB) Whale is empty, because this is the only way of having both GDIs satisfied by all individuals. Now let KB\u2032 = KB \u222a {Whale(Moby)}. In each model of\nCircvar(KB\u2032), Moby satisfies as many GDIs as possible, that is, exactly one of the two GDIs of KB\u2032. As a consequence, we have the reasonable inference:2\nCircvar(KB\u2032) |= {Moby} v \u2203has organ.Lungs t \u2203has organ.Gills .\nThe conflict between the two default properties inherited by Moby can be settled by adding a simple axiom like Whale v \u2203has organ.Lungs, that overrides the property of sea animals. In this specific example a strong axiom is appropriate; note, however, that the corresponding GDI would have the same effect under \u227aK ; for instance, we have:\nCircvar(KB\u2032 \u222a {Whale vn \u2203has organ.Lungs}) |= {Moby} v \u2203has organ.Lungs .\nConsider Circfix now. The expected subsumptions Mammal v \u2203has organ.Lungs and SeaAnimal v \u2203has organ.Gills are not entailed by Circfix(KB), because Lungs and Gills are empty in some models (as Circfix cannot change their extension to satisfy more GDIs). The two GDIs could be enabled by forcing Lungs and Gills to be nonempty. This can be done in several ways, e.g. via assertions such as Lungs(L) or inclusions such as > v \u2203aux.Lungs (where aux is a new auxiliary role). Let KB\u2032\u2032 denote such an extension. Then\nCircfix(KB\u2032\u2032) |= {Moby} v \u2203has organ.Lungs t \u2203has organ.Gills ,\n(similarly, the aforementioned expected consequences are entailed by Circfix(KB\u2032\u2032)). The conflict between the properties inherited from Mammal and SeaAnimal can be settled as discussed above.\n2\nThe impossibility of forcing existentials with GDIs in Circfix, illustrated by the above example, can be exploited to check whether a concept is always nonempty. It suffices to introduce a fresh role aux (in order to prevent interference with the other axioms of the knowledge base) and a GDI > vn \u2203aux.C. Clearly, the subsumption > v \u2203aux.C is entailed iff C is nonempty in all models of Circfix(KB). Similar ideas will be used in the rest of the paper.\nThe next example is artificial. It is a convenient way of illustrating the interplay of specificity and multiple inheritance.\nExample 3.8 Let KB be the following set of axioms:\nA1 v A\u20321 (6) A2 v A\u20322 (7) B v A1 uA2 (8) \u2203R1 u \u2203R\u20321 v \u22a5 (9) \u2203R2 u \u2203R\u20322 v \u22a5 (10) \u2203R1 u \u2203R2 v \u22a5 (11)\nA1 vn \u2203R1 (12) A2 vn \u2203R2 (13) A\u20321 vn \u2203R\u20321 (14) A\u20322 vn \u2203R\u20322 (15)\nFor all sets of concept names F , and for all models I of CircF (KB), each member x of BI (if any) satisfies exactly one of the top priority GDIs (12) and (13), that are conflicting due to (11). If x does\n2. The symbol t is description logics\u2019 equivalent of disjunction. Formally, (C tD)I = CI \u222aDI .\nnot satisfy (12) then it can satisfy the conflicting GDI (14); symmetrically, if x does not satisfy (13) then x can satisfy (15). Consequently, we have:\nCircfix(KB) |= B v (\u2203R1 u \u2203R\u20322) t (\u2203R2 u \u2203R\u20321).\n2\nThe last two examples show that GDIs and disjointness constraints together can express disjoint unions. Similar techniques will be used later on to simulate the law of excluded middle, negation, and 3-valued logic.\nSubsumption, instance checking, and the complement of concept satisfiability can be reduced to each other, as in the classical setting:\nTheorem 3.9 Let DL range over DL-liteR and EL\u22a5; let X = var, fix, F . In CircX(DL), subsumption, instance checking, and concept unsatisfiability can be reduced to each other in constant time.\nThe proof is not completely standard, due to the limited expressiveness of DL-liteR and EL\u22a5, as well as the peculiarities of nonmonotonic reasoning.3\nProof. First we focus on Circvar and CircF , where F consists of concept names occurring in a given KB.\nFrom unsatisfiability to subsumption. Checking unsatisfiability of a concept C can be reduced to checking the subsumptionC v \u22a5. DL-liteR does not support\u22a5 explicitly, however an equivalent concept A\u22a5 can be easily defined with the inclusion A\u22a5 v \u00acA\u22a5.\nFrom subsumption to unsatisfiability. Conversely, a subsumption C v D can be reduced to the unsatisfiability of C u \u00acD. In DL-liteR conjunction is not supported, so the subsumption must be reduced to the unsatisfiability of a fresh variable conceptA axiomatized byA v C andA v \u00acD. In EL\u22a5 conjunction is supported while negation is not; therefore the given subsumption can be reduced to the unsatisfiability of C u D\u0304 where D\u0304 is a fresh variable concept axiomatized with D\u0304 uD v \u22a5.\nFrom instance checking to subsumption. An instance checking query C(a) can be reduced to subsumption as follows: Introduce a fresh variable concept A and assert A(a); then minimize A with A vn \u22a5; now in all models I of Circvar, AI = {aI}. It follows that C(a) holds iff the subsumption A v C holds.\nFrom unsatisfiability to instance checking. Finally, the unsatisfiability of a concept C is equivalent to the validity of the instance checking problem \u00acC(a), where a is a fresh individual constant. In EL\u22a5, \u00acC must be suitably axiomatized with a fresh concept name C\u0304 and the inclusions C\u0304 uC v \u22a5,> vn C, and> vn C\u0304 (these three axioms entail the subsumption> v C t C\u0304, thereby enforcing the law of the excluded middle). In order to preserve the semantics of the knowledge base, > vn C and > vn C\u0304 must be given a priority strictly smaller than the priority of all the other defeasible inclusion in the KB. This ensures that the new GDIs cannot block the application of any of the original GDIs. Clearly, the two new GDIs must have the same priority.\n3. For example, in classical logic a subsumption C v D is a logical consequence of KB iff for any fresh individual a, D(a) is a logical consequence of KB \u222a {C(a)}. This approach is not correct for Circumscription. The models of CircF (KB) can be quite different from the models of CircF (KB \u222a {C(a)}); for instance, consider the example in which nonmonotonic reasoning makes Whale empty and the assertion Whale(Moby) overrides this inference.\nThis completes the proof for Circvar and CircF . The proof for Circfix can be obtained by replacing the fresh variable concept names A, C\u0304, and D\u0304 with a corresponding (variable) concept \u2203R, where R is a fresh role. 2\nNote that the above reductions still apply if priorities are specificity-based (\u227aK), with the exception of the reduction of concept unsatisfiability to instance checking in EL\u22a5. For this case, one can use Theorem 4.6 below to eliminate general priorities, and get a reduction for Circfix."}, {"heading": "4. Complexity Preserving Features", "text": "In some cases, nonmonotonic inferences and language features\u2014e.g. variable predicates and explicit priorities\u2014do not affect complexity. In this section several such results (and related lemmata) are collected; the reader is warned that, in general, they may not apply to all reasoning tasks and all language fragments. We start by observing that the logics we deal with enjoy the finite model property.\nLemma 4.1 Let KB = \u3008K,\u227a\u3009 be a DKB in DL-liteR or ELHO\u22a5,\u00ac. For all F \u2286 NC, CircF (KB) has a model only if CircF (KB) has a finite model whose size is exponential in the size of KB.\nProof. A simple adaptation of a result for ALCIO (Bonatti et al., 2006), taking role hierarchies into account. 2\nAs a consequence, these logics preserve classical consistency (because all descending chains of models originating from a finite model must be finite):\nTheorem 4.2 Let KB = \u3008KD \u222a KS,\u227a\u3009 be a DKB in DL-liteR or ELHO\u22a5,\u00ac. For all F \u2286 NC, KS is (classically) consistent iff CircF (KB) has a model.\nRemark 4.3 Obviously, a similar property holds for all circumscribed DLs with the finite model property, including ALCIO and ALCQO.\nSince knowledge base consistency is equivalent to its classical version, it will not be discussed in this paper any further.\nNext, we prove that under mild assumptions, CircF is not more expressive than Circfix (which is a special case of the former), that is, variable concept names do not increase the expressiveness of the logic and can be eliminated.4\nTheorem 4.4 If DL is a description logic fully supporting unqualified existential restrictions (\u2203 R),5 then, for allF \u2286 NC, concept consistency, subsumption, and instance checking in CircF (DL) can be reduced in linear time to concept consistency, subsumption, and instance checking (respectively) in Circfix(DL).\n4. The standard techniques for eliminating variable predicates (Cadoli, Eiter, & Gottlob, 1992) use connectives that are not fully supported in DL-liteR and EL, therefore an ad-hoc proof is needed. 5. We say that DL fully supports unqualified restrictions if they can occur wherever a concept name could.\nProof. Let KB be any given DKB in the language DL. Introduce a new role name RA for each (variable) concept name A 6\u2208 F . Then, replace each occurrence of A in KB with \u2203RA and call KB\u2032 the resulting KB. Recall that in Circfix(DL) all concept names are fixed and all roles are variable. Hence, the newly added roles RA behave in Circfix(KB\u2032) exactly in the same way as concepts A 6\u2208 F do in CircF (KB). Formally, there is a bijection between the models of CircF (KB) and the models of Circfix(KB\u2032), which preserves the interpretation of all role and concept names, except that the extension of concept names A 6\u2208 F in a model of CircF (KB) coincides with the domain of the corresponding role RA in the corresponding model of Circfix(KB\u2032). As a consequence, the consistency of a concept C w.r.t. CircF (KB) is equivalent to the consistency of C \u2032 w.r.t. Circfix(KB\u2032), where C \u2032 is obtained from C by replacing each occurrence of A 6\u2208 F with the corresponding \u2203RA. Similarly for subsumption and instance checking. 2\nSymmetrically, the next theorem proves that in EL\u22a5 fixed predicates can be eliminated using general priorities. The reduction adapts the classical encoding of fixed predicates to the limited expressiveness of EL\u22a5.\nTheorem 4.5 For all F \u2286 NC, concept consistency, subsumption, and instance checking in CircF (EL\u22a5) can be reduced in linear time to concept consistency, subsumption, and instance checking (respectively) in Circvar(EL\u22a5) with general priorities.\nProof. Let K = \u3008KS \u222a KD,\u227a\u3009 be a given EL\u22a5 DKB. Fixed predicates are removed through the following transformation. For each concept name A \u2208 F introduce a new concept name A\u0304 (representing \u00acA). Let K\u2217S be the set of all disjointness axioms A u A\u0304 v \u22a5, for each A \u2208 F . Let K\u2217D be the set of all defeasible inclusions > vn A and > vn A\u0304, for each A \u2208 F . Finally, let \u227a\u2032 be the minimal extension of \u227a such that for all \u03b4\u2217 \u2208 K\u2217D and all \u03b4 \u2208 KD, \u03b4\u2217 \u227a\u2032 \u03b4. Define\nK\u2032 = \u3008KS \u222a K\u2217S \u222a KD \u222a K\u2217D,\u227a\u2032\u3009 .\nClaim 1. Let J and J \u2032 be two classical models of KS \u222a K\u2217S such that J \u2032 <K\u2032,var J and for all A \u2208 F , A\u0304J = \u00acAJ . Then (i) for all \u03b4 \u2208 K\u2217D, satJ \u2032 (\u03b4) = satJ (\u03b4) and (ii) J and J \u2032 agree on all A \u2208 F . Proof of Claim 1: By definition of \u227a\u2032, the members of K\u2217D have maximal priority, therefore, for all \u03b4 \u2208 K\u2217D, satJ \u2032 (\u03b4) \u2287 satJ (\u03b4). If there existsA \u2208 F such that satJ \u2032(> vn A) \u2283 satJ (> vn A), then AJ \u2032 \u2283 AJ , and hence A\u0304J \u2032 \u2282 A\u0304J ; consequently satJ \u2032(> vn A\u0304) \u2282 satJ (> vn A\u0304) (a contradiction). Symmetrically, the assumption that satJ \u2032 (> vn A\u0304) \u2283 satJ (> vn A\u0304) leads to a contradiction. This proves (i); (ii) is a straightforward consequence of (i). Claim 2. Every model I of CircF (K) can be extended to a model J of Circvar(K\u2032). To prove this claim, extend I to J by setting A\u0304J = \u00acAI , for all concept names A \u2208 F . Suppose that J is not a model of Circvar(K\u2032). Since J satisfiesKS\u222aK\u2217S by construction, there must be a J \u2032 that satisfies KS \u222a K\u2217S and such that J \u2032 <K\u2032,var J . By Claim 1.(ii), J and J \u2032 agree on all A \u2208 F ; by Claim 1.(i), the improvement of J \u2032 over J concerns the GDIs in KD. It follows that I \u2032 <K,F I, where I \u2032 is the restriction of J \u2032 to the language of K. This contradicts the assumption that I is a model of CircF (K).\nClaim 3. For all models J of Circvar(K\u2032), the restriction of J to the language of K is a model of CircF (K).\nLet I be the restriction of J to the language ofK. Clearly I satisfiesKS. Now suppose that I is not a model of CircF (K), which means that there exists I \u2032 satisfying KS and such that I \u2032 <K,F I.\nExtend I \u2032 to J \u2032 by setting A\u0304J \u2032 = \u00acAI\u2032 , for all concept names A \u2208 F . Note that I and I \u2032 must agree on all A \u2208 F , therefore J and J \u2032 agree on them, too. Consequently, for all \u03b4 \u2208 K\u2217D, satJ \u2032 (\u03b4) = satJ (\u03b4). Moreover, I \u2032 improves I over the GDIs of KD, therefore J \u2032 improves J over KD, too. It follows that J \u2032 <K\u2032,var J (a contradiction). The Theorem is now a straightforward consequence of Claims 2 and 3. 2\nNow consider priority relations and GDIs. We are going to prove that if the language fragment is sufficiently rich, then they can be simulated with the specificity-based relation \u227aK and normalized defeasible inclusions A vn C (whose left-hand side is a concept name), respectively.\nLet KB = \u3008K,\u227a\u3009 be any given DKB in EL\u22a5. First we need to define a new fixed concept Dom that encodes the domain without being equivalent to >. This requires the following transformation:"}, {"heading": "A\u2217 = Dom uA (\u2203R.C)\u2217 = Dom u \u2203R.(C\u2217)", "text": ">\u2217 = Dom (C uD)\u2217 = C\u2217 uD\u2217\n\u22a5\u2217 = \u22a5 (C v[n] D)\u2217 = C\u2217 v[n] D\u2217\nObtain K\u2217 from K by transforming all inclusions in K and by adding a nonemptiness axiom > v \u2203aux .Dom (aux a fresh role) plus an assertion Dom(a) for each a \u2208 NI occurring in K. It is not hard to see that the restrictions to Dom of the classical models of K\u2217 correspond to the classical models of K. More precisely, let I\u2217 be a classical model of K\u2217, we obtain a classical model I of K by setting AI = AI\u2217 \u2229 DomI\u2217 and RI = RI\u2217 \u2229 (DomI\u2217 \u00d7 DomI\u2217), for each concept name A and role name R occurring in K. Notice that it is necessary for DomI\u2217 to be non-empty for this to work. Conversely, given a classical model I of K, it is sufficient to set DomI = \u2206I and auxI = \u2206I \u00d7\u2206I to make I a classical model of K\u2217.\nNow we have to remove general priorities and GDIs. For all GDIs \u03b4 = (C vn D) \u2208 K\u2217, add two fresh predicates A\u03b4, P\u03b4 and replace \u03b4 with the following axiom schemata:\nDom v A\u03b4 A\u03b4\u2032 v A\u03b4 for all \u03b4\u2032 \u227a \u03b4 (16) A\u03b4 vn \u2203P\u03b4 \u2203P\u03b4 u C v D (17)\nCall the new DKB KB\u2032 = \u3008K\u2032,\u227aK\u2032\u3009. By (16), the specificity-based relation\u227aK\u2032 prioritizes the new GDIs according to the original priorities. Moreover, by (17), a defeasible inclusion A\u03b4 vn \u2203P\u03b4 is satisfied by an individual if and only if the same individual satisfies the corresponding GDI \u03b4. Then it is not difficult to verify that all the reasoning tasks such that none of the new predicates A\u03b4 and P\u03b4 occur in the query yield the same answer in \u3008K\u2217,\u227a\u2217\u3009 and KB\u2032. As a consequence of the above discussion, by combining the transformation \u00b7\u2217 with (16) and (17), and by observing that the reduction makes use of EL\u22a5 constructs only, we have:\nTheorem 4.6 Reasoning in Circfix(EL\u22a5) with explicit priorities and GDIs can be reduced in polynomial time to reasoning in Circfix(EL\u22a5) with only specificity-based priority and defeasible inclusions of the form A vn \u2203P .\nFinally, by Theorem 4.4, the above result can be extended to all of CircF :\nCorollary 4.7 Reasoning in CircF (EL\u22a5) with explicit priorities and GDIs can be reduced in polynomial time to reasoning in Circfix(EL\u22a5) with only specificity-based priority and defeasible inclusions of the form A vn \u2203P ."}, {"heading": "5. Undecidability of EL with Fixed Roles", "text": "In Circ\u2217 both concept names and roles can be fixed; however, as we show in this section, fixed roles in general make reasoning tasks undecidable. To this end, the model conservative extension problem defined by Lutz and Wolter (2010) is reduced to the subsumption problem.6\nSome preliminary definitions are needed; given a signature \u03a3 \u2286 NC \u222aNR and two interpretations I and J , we say that I and J coincide on \u03a3 if and only if \u2206I = \u2206J and for all predicates X \u2208 \u03a3, XI = XJ . Then, let T1 \u2286 T2 be classical EL TBoxes, T2 is a model conservative extension of T1 if and only if for every model I of T1, there exists a model J of T2 such that I and J coincide on the signature of T1.\nLutz and Wolter (2010) prove (see Lemma 40) that there exists a class C of EL TBoxes such that the problem of checking whether a TBox in C is a model conservative extension of another TBox in C is undecidable. Moreover, the following property holds.\nLemma 5.1 Given two TBoxes T1 \u2286 T2 in C, if T2 is not a model conservative extension of T1 then there exists a model I of T1 and an interpretation J of T2 such that I and J coincide on the signature of T1 and the set of individuals in J that violate at least one concept inclusion from T2 is finite.\nFor a DKB KB = \u3008KS \u222a KD,\u227a\u3009 and an interpretation I of KB, we denote by abKB(I) (for abnormal) the total number of individuals x \u2208 \u2206I such that x 6\u2208 satI(\u03b4) for some \u03b4 \u2208 KD.\nLemma 5.2 Let KB = \u3008KS \u222a KD, \u2205\u3009 be a DKB and I be a classical model of KB s.t. abKB(I) is finite. For all F \u2286 NC \u222a NR, either I is a model of CircF (KB) or there exists a model J of CircF (KB) such that J <KB,F I.\nProof. It suffices to show that each <KB,F -chain descending from I is finite. Since DIs are incomparable with each other, each step in the <KB,F -chain must improve at least one DI and leave all other DIs unchanged. Formally, if I \u2032 <KB,F I then there exists at least a DI \u03b4 \u2208 KD such that satI(\u03b4) \u2282 satI\u2032(\u03b4) and for all \u03b4\u2032 \u2208 KD it holds satI(\u03b4\u2032) \u2286 satI\u2032(\u03b4\u2032). Hence, abKB(I \u2032) < abKB(I) and the thesis follows. 2\nAssume that T1, T2 \u2208 C are given, where T1 \u2286 T2, and let \u03a3 be the signature of T1. Let F = \u03a3 and KB = \u3008K, \u2205\u3009 where K = T1 \u222a {C vn D | C v D \u2208 T2 \\ T1}.\nLemma 5.3 For all T1, T2 \u2208 C, T2 is a model conservative extension of T1 iff Circ\u2217F (KB) |= C v D, for all C v D \u2208 T2.\nProof. [if ] Suppose by contradiction that T2 is not a model conservative extension of T1 and Circ\u2217F (KB) |= C v D, for all C v D \u2208 T2. By Lemma 5.1, we can consider a model I of T1 and an extension J of I on the signature of T2, such that the set of individuals that violate in J at least one inclusion of T2 is finite. Since J is a classical model of KB and abKB(J ) is finite, by Lemma 5.2, there exists a model J \u2032 of Circ\u2217F (KB) such that either J \u2032 = J or J \u2032 <KB,F J . Since Circ\u2217F (KB) entails T2 and F = \u03a3, J \u2032 is a (classical) model of T2 that coincides with J and I on \u03a3 (absurdum).\n6. The sketch of this proof has been kindly provided by Frank Wolter in a personal communication. Any imprecision in the proof is due to the authors.\n[only if ] Suppose by contradiction that T2 is a model conservative extension of T1, and for some C\u0302 v D\u0302 \u2208 T2, it holds Circ\u2217F (KB) 6|= C\u0302 v D\u0302. Since Circ\u2217F (KB) 6|= C\u0302 v D\u0302, there exists a model I of Circ\u2217F (KB) such that satI(C\u0302 vn D\u0302) \u2282 \u2206I . Since I is a model of T1 and T2 is a model conservative extension of T1, there exists an interpretation J that (i) coincides with I on \u03a3 and (ii) is a model of T2, i.e., for all defeasible inclusions C vn D in KB, satJ (C vn D) = \u2206J . Therefore, J <KB,F I (absurdum). 2\nSince checking whether a TBox is a model conservative extension of another one has been proved to be undecidable for C \u2286 EL (Lutz & Wolter, 2010), it immediately follows that subsumption in Circ\u2217F (EL) is undecidable. Moreover, since subsumption can be reduced to concept unsatisfiability or instance checking (Theorem 3.9), the latter reasoning tasks are undecidable as well.\nTheorem 5.4 In Circ\u2217F (EL), subsumption, concept consistency and instance checking are undecidable.\n6. Complexity of Circumscribed DL-liteR In this section we focus on DL-liteR DKBs. We first prove that in Circvar(DL-liteR) the reasoning tasks are complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. From this, according to Theorem 4.4, we immediately obtain an hardness result for Circfix(DL-liteR) too. Then, the membership for Circfix(DL-liteR) to second level of the polynomial hierarchy is shown for the fragment of DKBs with left-fixed defeasible inclusions, i.e. defeasible inclusions of type A vn C.\n6.1 Complexity of Circvar(DL-liteR)\nIn this section we prove that Circvar(DL-liteR) subsumption, concept unsatisfiability (co-sat) and instance checking are complete for \u03a0p2.\nOur membership results rely on the possibility of extracting a small (polynomial) model from any model of a circumscribed DKB.\nLemma 6.1 Let KB be a DL-liteR DKB. For all models I of Circvar(KB) and all x \u2208 \u2206I there exists a model J of Circvar(KB) such that (i) \u2206J \u2286 \u2206I , (ii) x \u2208 \u2206J , (iii) for all DL-liteR concepts C, x \u2208 CI iff x \u2208 CJ (iv) |\u2206J | is polynomial in the size of KB.\nProof. Assume that KB = \u3008KS \u222a KD,\u227a\u3009, I is a model of Circvar(KB), and x \u2208 \u2206I . Let cl(KB) be the set of all concepts occurring in KB. Choose a minimal set \u2206 \u2286 \u2206I containing: (i) x, (ii) all aI such that a \u2208 NI \u2229 cl(KB), (iii) for each concept \u2203R in cl(KB) satisfied in I, a node yR such that for some z \u2208 \u2203RI , (z, yR) \u2208 RI .\nNow define J as follows: (i) \u2206J = \u2206, (ii) aJ = aI (for a \u2208 NI \u2229 cl(KB)), (iii) AJ = AI \u2229\u2206 (A \u2208 NC \u2229 cl(KB)), and (iv) PJ = {(z, yP ) | z \u2208 \u2206 and z \u2208 \u2203P I} \u222a {(yP\u2212 , z) | z \u2208 \u2206 and z \u2208 \u2203P\u2212I} (P \u2208 NR).\nNote that by construction, for all z \u2208 \u2206J and for all C \u2208 cl(KB), z \u2208 CJ iff z \u2208 CI ; consequently, J is a classical model of S. Moreover, the cardinality of \u2206J is linear in the size of KB (by construction). So we are only left to show that J is a <KD,var-minimal model of KB.\nSuppose not, and consider any J \u2032 <KD,var J . Define I \u2032 as follows: (i) \u2206I \u2032 = \u2206I , (ii) aI \u2032\n= aI , (iii)AI \u2032 = AJ \u2032 , (iv) P I \u2032 = PJ \u2032 . Note that the elements in \u2206I \\\u2206J \u2032 satisfy no left-hand side of\nany DL-liteR inclusion (be it classical or defeasible), therefore all inclusions are vacuously satisfied.\nMoreover, the restriction of I \u2032 to \u2206J \u2032 is <KD,var-smaller than the corresponding restriction of I in the interpretation ordering. It follows that I \u2032 <KD,var I, and hence I cannot be a model of Circvar(KB) (a contradiction). 2\nTo illustrate Lemma 6.1, consider the DKB KB in Figure 2(a) and the model I in Figure 2(b). Note that all individuals in I satisfy the defeasible inclusion inKB. The \u201csmall\u201d model J , depicted in Figure 2(c), is obtained as follows. First, it contains the designated individual x; then, for each concept \u2203R that occurs in KB and is satisfied in I (where R is a possibly inverse role), it contains a representative yR that receives role R in I. In our case, assume that the chosen representatives are: yQ = 6, yQ\u2212 = 4, yS = 8, and yT = 7. Hence, \u2206J = {x, 6, 4, 8, 7}. The roles in J are obtained by connecting each individual z that satisfies a concept \u2203P in I to the chosen representative yP . For instance, since 4 satisfies \u2203S in I, we have the edge (4, 8) \u2208 SJ . Moreover, the representative for an inverse role P\u2212 is connected to all nodes that satisfy the concept \u2203P\u2212 in I. In our case, since 4 is the representative for Q\u2212 and 6 satisfies \u2203Q\u2212, we have the edge (4, 6) \u2208 QJ . Besides, since 4 itself satisfies \u2203Q\u2212, we also have (4, 4) \u2208 QJ . It can be verified by inspection that J is a model of Circvar(KB), as its individuals satisfy all classical and defeasible inclusions in KB.\nTheorem 6.2 Concept consistency over Circvar(DL-liteR) DKBs is in \u03a3p2. Subsumption and instance checking are in \u03a0p2.\nProof. By Lemma 6.1, it suffices to guess a polynomial size model that provides an answer to the given reasoning problem. Then, with an NP oracle, it is possible to check that the model is minimal w.r.t. <var. 2\nThe complexity upper bounds proved by Theorem 6.2 are in fact tight, as stated by Theorem 6.6. The proof of hardness is based on the reduction of the minimal-entailment problem of positive disjunctive logic programs \u2014 which has been proved to be \u03a0p2-hard (Eiter & Gottlob, 1995).\nA clause is a formula l1 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 lh, where the li are literals over a set of propositional variables PV = {p1, . . . , pn}. A positive disjunctive logic program (PDLP for short) is a set of clauses\nS = {c1, . . . , cm} where each cj contains at least one positive literal. A truth valuation for S is a set I \u2286 PV , containing the propositional variables which are true. A truth valuation is a model of S if it satisfies all clauses in S. For a literal l, we write S |=min l if and only if every minimal7 model of S satisfies l. The minimal-entailment problem can be then defined as follows: given a PDLP S and a literal l, determine whether S |=min l.\nFor each propositional variable pi, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, we introduce two concept names Pi and P\u0304i, where the latter encodes \u00acpi. We denote by Lj , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 2n, a generic Pi or P\u0304i. For each clause cj \u2208 S we introduce the concept name Cj . Then, two other concept names True and False represent the set of true and false literals, respectively. We employ roles RLi, RTrueCj , RFalseP\u0304i, RTrueP\u0304i, and TLi.\nIn the following, defeasible inclusions \u03b4 are assigned a numerical priority h(\u03b4), with the intended meaning that \u03b41 \u227a \u03b42 iff h(\u03b41) < h(\u03b42).\nThe first step consists in reifying all the propositional literals, i.e., we want each of them to correspond to an individual. Therefore, we introduce the axioms:\nNonEmpty(a) (18)\nNonEmpty v \u00acLi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n) (19) NonEmpty v \u2203RLi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n) (20)\n\u2203RL\u2212i v Li (1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n) (21) Li v \u00acLj (1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 2n) (22) Li vn \u00acLi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n) [priority: 0] (23)\nAxioms (18-21) force the literal encodings Li to be non empty. Axioms (22) make literal encodings pairwise disjoint. Finally, defeasible inclusions (23) are used to reduce the Li to singletons. Then, we represent the set of clauses S by adding for each clause cj = lj1 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 ljk, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, the following axioms.\nLji v Cj (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k) (24) Cj vn \u00acCj [priority: 0] (25)\nNonEmpty v \u2203RTrueCj (26) \u2203RTrueC\u2212j v TrueCj (27)\nTrueCj v True (28) TrueCj v Cj (29)\nAxioms (24\u201325) ensure that each (encoding of a) clause Cj is the union of its literals Lji. Axioms (26\u201329) assure that each clause contains at least one true literal. In order to model the concepts\n7. With respect to set inclusion.\nTrue and False and the correct meaning of complementary literals we add the following axioms.\nTrue v \u00acFalse (30) TruePi v \u2203RFalseP\u0304i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) (31)\n\u2203RFalseP\u0304\u2212i v FalseP\u0304i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) (32) TruePi v Pi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) (33) TruePi v True (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) (34) FalseP\u0304i v False (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) (35) FalseP\u0304i v P\u0304i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) (36)\nThe previous schemata regard TruePi only; analogous schemata are defined for FalsePi. The following inclusions ensure that the truth of a given literal is locally visible in the individual a, through the auxiliary roles TLi.\nTrueLi v \u2203TL\u2212i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n) (37) TrueLi w \u2203TL\u2212i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n) (38) \u2203TLi v NonEmpty (1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n) (39)\nThe axioms defined so far encode the classical semantics of S. To represent only minimal models we add the following axioms.\nPi vn FalsePi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) [priority: 1] (40) Pi vn TruePi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) [priority: 2] (41)\nGiven a PDLP S, we call the KB defined above KBS . Given a truth assignment I \u2286 PV and a domain \u2206 = {a, d1, . . . , d2n}, we define a corresponding interpretation, denoted by model(S, I,\u2206), whose structure mirrors I . Formally, model(S, I,\u2206) is the interpretation I = (\u2206, \u00b7I) such that:\nI. aI = a;\nII. NonEmptyI = {a};\nIII. RLIi = {(a, di)} and TLIi = {(a, di) | I |= li};\nIV. for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n, LIi = {di};\nV. for each 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, CIj = {LIj1, . . . , LIjh} where cj = lj1 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 ljh;\nVI. for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n, di \u2208 TrueLIi (resp. di \u2208 FalseLIi ) iff I |= li (resp. I 6 |=li);\nVII. (X Y )I = XI \u2229 Y I , where X Y is a concept name obtained by concatenating two other concept names X and Y (for instance, concept name TrueCj is obtained by concatenating concept names True and Cj); in other words, juxtaposition represents conjunction;\nVIII. (RX Y )I = \u2206I \u00d7 (X Y )I .\nThe following lemma, proved in the Appendix, states the relationship between I and model(S, I,\u2206).\nLemma 6.3 Given a PDLP S over PV = {p1, . . . , pn} and a truth assignment I \u2286 PV , I is a minimal model of S iff the interpretation model(S, I,\u2206) is a model of Circvar(KBS), for all domains \u2206 with |\u2206| = 2n+ 1.\nThe following result, also proved in the Appendix, shows that any model of Circvar(KBS) in fact corresponds to a minimal model of S.\nLemma 6.4 If I is a model of Circvar(KBS), then there exist a minimal model I of S such that pi \u2208 I iff P Ii \u2286 TrueI iff P\u0304 Ii \u2286 FalseI , for all i = 1, . . . , n.\nLemma 6.5 Given a PDLP S and a literal l represented by concept name L, the following are equivalent:\n(minimal entailment) S |=min l;\n(subsumption) Circvar(KBS) |= L v True;\n(co-sat) FalseL is not satisfiable w.r.t Circvar(KBS);\n(instance checking) Circvar(KBS) |= (\u2203TL)(a).\nProof. The three inference problems onKBS represent the fact that for all models I of Circvar(KBS) we have thatLI\u2229TrueI is not empty \u2014 co-sat in particular relies on the fact that in all Circvar(KBS) models True and False are a partition of the individuals belonging to the literal concepts. Therefore, it suffices to prove that l is true in all minimal models of S iff LI \u2229 TrueI 6= \u2205 in all models of Circvar(KBS).\nLemma 6.3 establishes a bijection between minimal models I of S and certain models I = model(S, I,\u2206) of Circvar(KBS), such that the truth of a literal l in I corresponds to the inclusion of LI into TrueI in I (see rule VI in the definition of model ). Therefore, the right-to-left direction is immediately satisfied. For the left-to-right direction, assume that l is true in all minimal models of S and let I be a model of Circvar(KBS). By Lemma 6.4, there is a minimal model I of S such that pi \u2208 I iff P Ii \u2286 TrueI . If l = pi, we conclude LI \u2286 TrueI and the thesis. Similarly, for l = p\u0304i.\n2\nThe following theorem provides complexity lower-bounds for the main decision problems of both Circvar(DL-liteR) and Circfix(DL-liteR). The result for Circvar(DL-liteR) follows immediately from Lemma 6.5, and it extends to Circfix(DL-liteR) due to Theorem 4.4.\nTheorem 6.6 Subsumption, co-sat and instance checking over circumscribed DL-liteR DKBs with general priorities are \u03a0p2-hard.\n6.2 Upper Bound of Circfix(DL-liteR) with Restrictions\nWe develop the same argument used for Circvar(DL-liteR) to prove similar upper bounds for Circfix(DL-liteR) DKBs with left-fixed DIs (i.e., their left-hand side is fixed or\u2014equivalently\u2014 a concept name) or empty priority relations. Whether the same upper bounds apply to Circfix(DL-liteR) without any restriction is left as an open question.\nLemma 6.7 Let KB be a DL-liteR knowledge base whose DIs are left-fixed. For all models I of Circfix(KB) and all x \u2208 \u2206I there exists a model J of Circfix(KB) such that (i) \u2206J \u2286 \u2206I , (ii) x \u2208 \u2206J , (iii) for all DL-liteR concepts C, x \u2208 CI iff x \u2208 CJ , and (iv) |\u2206J | is polynomial in the size of KB.\nProof. Assume that I is a model of Circfix(KB), with KB = \u3008KS \u222a KD,\u227a\u3009, and x \u2208 \u2206I . Let cl(KB) be the set of all concepts occurring in KB. Choose a minimal set \u2206 \u2286 \u2206I containing: (i) x, (ii) all aI such that a \u2208 NI \u2229 cl(KB), (iii) for each concept \u2203R in cl(KB) satisfied in I, a node yR such that yR \u2208 (\u2203R\u2212)I (where \u2203P\u2212\u2212 is considered equivalent to \u2203P ), and finally (iv) for all inclusions C v[n] \u2203R in KB such that (C u \u2203R)I 6= \u2205, a node z \u2208 (C u \u2203R)I .\nNow define J as follows: (i) \u2206J = \u2206, (ii) aJ = aI (for a \u2208 NI \u2229 cl(KB)), (iii) AJ = AI \u2229\u2206 (A \u2208 NC \u2229 cl(KB)), and (iv) PJ = {(z, yP ) | z \u2208 \u2206 and z \u2208 \u2203P I} \u222a {(yP , z) | z \u2208 \u2206 and z \u2208 \u2203P\u2212I} (P \u2208 NR).\nNote that by construction, for all z \u2208 \u2206J and for all C \u2208 cl(KB), z \u2208 CJ iff z \u2208 CI ; consequently, J is a classical model of KB. Moreover, the cardinality of \u2206J is linear in the size of KB (by construction). So we are only left to show that J is a <fix-minimal model of KB.\nSuppose not, and consider any J \u2032 <fix J . Define I \u2032 as follows: (a) \u2206I \u2032 = \u2206I , (b) aI \u2032 = aI , (c) AI \u2032 = AI , (d) each RI \u2032 is a minimal set such that (d1) RI\n\u2032 \u2287 RJ \u2032 , (d2) for all z \u2208 \u2206I \\\u2206J , and for all inclusions C v \u2203R or C vn \u2203R in KB such that z \u2208 (C u \u2203R)I , if RJ \u2032 contains a pair (v, w), then (z, w) \u2208 RI\u2032 ; finally, (d3) each P I\u2032 is closed under the role inclusion axioms of KB. Note that, by construction,\n(*) for all z \u2208 \u2206I \\\u2206J , z \u2208 \u2203RI\u2032 only if z \u2208 \u2203RI ;\n(**) for all z \u2208 \u2206I \\\u2206J , z \u2208 \u2203RI\u2032 only if there exists v \u2208 \u2206J \u2032 such that v \u2208 \u2203RJ \u2032 .\nNow we prove that I \u2032 is a classical model of KB. By construction, the edges (z, w) introduced in (d2) do not change the set of existential restrictions satisfied by the members of \u2206J ; as a consequence \u2014 and since J \u2032 is a model of KB\u2014 the members of \u2206J satisfy all the classical CIs of KB.\nNow consider an arbitrary element z \u2208 \u2206I \\\u2206J and any CI \u03b3 ofKS. If \u03b3 is an inclusion without existential quantifiers, then I and I \u2032 give the same interpretation to \u03b3 by definition, therefore z satisfies \u03b3. If \u03b3 is \u2203R v A, \u2203R v \u00acA, \u2203R v \u00ac\u2203S, or A v \u00ac\u2203R (and considering that I satisfies \u03b3) z fails to satisfy \u03b3 only if for some R\u2032 \u2208 {R,S}, z 6\u2208 (\u2203R\u2032)I and z \u2208 (\u2203R\u2032)I\u2032 ; this is impossible by (*). Next, suppose \u03b3 is \u2203R v \u2203S. If z \u2208 (\u2203R)I\u2032 , then by (**) there exists a v \u2208 \u2206J \u2032 satisfying (\u2203R)J \u2032 and hence (\u2203S)J \u2032 (as J \u2032 is a model of KS), therefore z \u2208 (\u2203S)I \u2032 (by d2). We are only left to consider \u03b3 = A v \u2203R: If z \u2208 AI\u2032 = AI , then there exists wA \u2208 AJ \u2032\n(by construction of \u2206) and wA \u2208 (\u2203R)J \u2032 because J \u2032 is a model of KB. Then z \u2208 (\u2203R)I\u2032 by (d2). Therefore, in all possible cases, z satisfies \u03b3. This proves that I \u2032 satisfies all the strong CIs of KB. It is not hard to verify that I \u2032 satisfies\nalso all role inclusions of KB. Therefore, in order to derive a contradiction, we are left to show that I \u2032 <fix I (which implies that I is not a model of Circfix(KB)). Since by assumption J \u2032 <fix J , it suffices to prove the following claim: if satJ (\u03b4) \u2286 satJ \u2032(\u03b4) (resp. satJ (\u03b4) \u2282 satJ \u2032(\u03b4)), then satI(\u03b4) \u2286 satI\u2032(\u03b4) (resp. satI(\u03b4) \u2282 satI\u2032(\u03b4)).\nIn \u2206J , I and J (resp. I \u2032 and J \u2032) satisfy the same concepts, therefore we only need to show that for all z \u2208 \u2206I \\ \u2206J , if z \u2208 satI(\u03b4) then z \u2208 satI\u2032(\u03b4). In all cases but those in which the\nright-hand side of \u03b4 is \u2203R, the proof is similar to the proof for strong CIs (it exploits (*) and the fact that concept names are fixed).\nLet \u03b4 be A vn \u2203R and consider an arbitrary z \u2208 \u2206I \\\u2206J such that z \u2208 satI(\u03b4). Since concept names are fixed, the only interesting case is that z actively satisfies \u03b4, i.e. z \u2208 (A u \u2203R)I . By construction, \u2206 contains an individual v \u2208 (A u \u2203R)J . Since by hypothesis satJ (\u03b4) \u2286 satJ \u2032(\u03b4), v \u2208 (A u \u2203R)J \u2032 and hence, by (d2), z \u2208 (\u2203R)I\u2032 , that is z \u2208 satI\u2032(\u03b4). 2\nTo prove the same lemma under the assumption that the priority relation is empty we need some preliminary notions. Given a KB KB = \u3008KS \u222a KD,\u227a\u3009, an interpretation I and an individual z \u2208 \u2206I , we denote with KB[z] the classical knowledge base:\nKB[z] = KS \u222a { C v D | (C vn D) \u2208 KD and z \u2208 satI(C vn D) } Then, the support of a concept C in I, supp I(C), is the set of individuals z \u2208 \u2206I such that, for some A, z \u2208 AI and A vKB[z] C. If z \u2208 supp I(C) we say that z supports C in I.\nLemma 6.8 Let KB = \u3008K, \u2205\u3009 be a DL-liteR knowledge base. For all models I of Circfix(KB) and all x \u2208 \u2206I there exists a model J of Circfix(KB) such that (i) \u2206J \u2286 \u2206I , (ii) x \u2208 \u2206J , (iii) for all DL-liteR concepts C, x \u2208 CI iff x \u2208 CJ , and (iv) |\u2206J | is polynomial in the size of KB.\nProof. Assume that I is a model of Circfix(KB) and let \u2206 \u2286 \u2206I be defined as in the above proof of Lemma 6.7, except for case (iv), which is replaced by: (iv\u2019) for all inclusions C v[n] \u2203R in KB such that supp I(\u2203R) 6= \u2205, a node w\u2203R \u2208 supp I(\u2203R). That is, for each inclusion whose RHS is variable, we pick a witness that is in the support of the RHS, if such a witness exists.\nNext, define J as in the proof of Lemma 6.7. As before, J is a classical model of KB and the cardinality of \u2206J is linear in the size of KB. We are left to show that J is <fix-minimal. Suppose not, and consider any J \u2032 <fix J . Since the priority relation is empty, for all DIs \u03b4 in KB, satJ (\u03b4) \u2286 satJ \u2032(\u03b4). Hence, for all concepts C it holds supp J (C) \u2286 supp J \u2032(C). Define I \u2032 as in the proof of Lemma 6.7, except for case (d2), which is replaced by: (d2\u2019) for all z \u2208 \u2206I \\\u2206J , and for all inclusions C v[n] \u2203R in KB such that z \u2208 supp I(\u2203R), if RJ \u2032 contains a pair (v, w), then (z, w) \u2208 RI\u2032 . We prove that I \u2032 <fix I, contradicting the hypothesis that I is a model of Circfix(KB). The only non-trivial case consists in proving that the individuals in \u2206I\n\u2032 \\\u2206J \u2032 satisfy in I \u2032 the same inclusions of type C v[n] \u2203S that they satisfy in I.\nAssume that z \u2208 \u2206I\u2032 \\ \u2206J \u2032 satisfies C v[n] \u2203S in I; we distinguish two cases. First, if z \u2208 supp I(\u2203S), we have that \u2206J \u2032 contains a witnessw\u2203S s.t. w\u2203S \u2208 supp J (\u2203S) \u2286 supp J \u2032(\u2203S). Therefore, there exists a pair (w\u2203S , y) \u2208 SJ \u2032\nand, by (d2\u2019), (z, y) \u2208 SI\u2032 . Second, assume that z 6\u2208 supp I(\u2203S). Since z \u2208 satI(C v[n] D), we have that z 6\u2208 supp I(C). Therefore, if C = A, then z 6\u2208 AI = AI\u2032 , whereas if C = \u2203R, then by (d2\u2019) z 6\u2208 (\u2203R)I\u2032 . In both cases, z vacuously satisfies \u03b4 in I \u2032. 2\nTheorem 6.9 Let KB be a DKB with left-fixed DIs or an empty priority relation. Concept consistency in Circfix(KB) is in \u03a3p2. Subsumption and instance checking are in \u03a0 p 2.\nProof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 6.2. 2"}, {"heading": "7. Complexity of Circumscribed EL and EL\u22a5", "text": "Recall that reasoning in circumscribed EL is undecidable when roles can be fixed. Here we analyze the other cases, were F \u2286 NC.\nIn EL, that cannot express any contradictions, defeasible inclusions cannot be possibly blocked under Circvar, and circumscription collapses to classical reasoning:\nTheorem 7.1 Let KB = \u3008KS \u222aKD,\u227a\u3009 be an EL DKB. Then I is a model of Circvar(KB) iff I is a model of KS \u222a K\u0302D, where K\u0302D = {A v C | (A vn C) \u2208 KD}.\nProof. Let I be any model of Circvar(KB), and let J be the interpretation such that (i) \u2206J = \u2206I , (ii) for all a \u2208 NI, aJ = aI , (iii) for all A \u2208 NC, AJ = \u2206J , and (iv) for all P \u2208 NR, PJ = \u2206J \u00d7\u2206J . It can be easily verified by structural induction that for all EL concepts C, CJ = \u2206J and hence each domain element of J satisfies all EL inclusions (strong and defeasible). Then, clearly, J is a model of Circvar(KB). Consequently, for all \u03b4 \u2208 KD, satI(\u03b4) = \u2206I , otherwise J <var I (a contradiction). It follows that I is a classical model of KS \u222a K\u0302D. 2\nBy the results of the work of Baader et al. (2005), it follows that in Circvar(EL), concept satisfiability is trivial, subsumption and instance checking are in P.\nRemark 7.2 Clearly, the same argument and the same result apply to Circvar(ELHO).\nIf we make EL more interesting by adding \u22a5 as a source of inconsistency, then complexity increases significantly.\nTheorem 7.3 In Circvar(EL\u22a5), concept satisfiability, instance checking, and subsumption are ExpTime-hard. These results still hold if knowledge bases contain no assertion.8\nProof. Let EL\u00acA be the extension of EL where atomic concepts can be negated. We first reduce TBox satisfiability in EL\u00acA (which is known to be ExpTime-hard, see Baader et al., 2005) to the complement of subsumption in Circvar(EL\u22a5). Let T be a TBox (i.e., a set of CIs) in EL\u00acA. First introduce for each concept nameA occurring in T a fresh concept name A\u0304 whose intended meaning is \u00acA. Obtain T \u2032 from T by replacing each literal \u00acA with A\u0304. Let KB = \u3008K,\u227aK\u3009 be the DKB obtained by extending T \u2032 with the following inclusions, where U and UA \u2014 for all A occurring in T\u2014 are fresh concept names (representing undefined truth values), and R is a fresh role name:\nA u A\u0304 v \u22a5 (42) A u UA v \u22a5 (43) A\u0304 u UA v \u22a5 (44)\nUA v U (45)\n> vn A (46) > vn A\u0304 (47) > vn UA (48) > vn \u2203R.UA (49)\nWe prove that T is satisfiable iff in some model of Circvar(KB) all UA\u2019s are empty, which holds iff Circvar(KB) 6|= > v \u2203R.U . Consequently, subsumption in Circvar(EL\u22a5) is ExpTime-hard. Assume that T is satisfiable and I is a model of T with domain \u2206I . From I we define an interpretation\n8. Equivalently, in DL\u2019s terminology: ABoxes are empty.\nJ that is a model of Circvar(KB) such that UJ = \u2205, thus proving that Circvar(KB) 6|= > v \u2203R.U . J has the same domain as I, and all concepts and roles occurring in T have the same interpretation as in I; we only need to define the interpretation of the newly introduced concepts A\u0304, UA, and U , and of the role R. We set A\u0304J = \u2206I \\AI and UJA = UJ = RJ = \u2205.\nBy construction J is a model of the classical inclusions in KB, in particular CIs (42)\u2013(45). It remains to prove that J is minimal w.r.t. <var, i.e., it is not possible to improve any DI \u03b4 without violating another DI that is either incomparable with \u03b4, or has a higher priority than \u03b4. Notice that defeasible inclusions (46) (resp., (47)) are violated by all individuals not inAJ (resp., all individuals in AJ ). DIs (48) and (49) are violated by all individuals. Moreover, notice that DIs (46)\u2013(49) are mutually incomparable according to specificity.\nEach DI of type (46) or (47) can only be improved at the expenses of the corresponding DI of the other type. Moreover, improving DIs (48) or (49) requires setting UJA 6= \u2205, which, due to rules (43) and (44) would damage the incomparable DIs (46) and/or (47). This proves that J is a model of Circvar(KB), and hence Circvar(KB) 6|= > v \u2203R.U .\nConversely, assume that Circvar(KB) 6|= > v \u2203R.U , and let I be a model of Circvar(KB) with an individual x \u2208 \u2206I such that x 6\u2208 (\u2203R.U)I . Due to rule (45), x 6\u2208 (\u2203R.UA)I for all atomic concepts A. Hence, x violates all DIs of type (49). If there exists a concept UA such that (UA)I is not empty, then the model obtained from I by adding an R-edge from x to an individual in (UA)I is smaller than I according to <var, which is a contradiction. Therefore, all concepts UA are empty in I.\nNext, we show that for all atomic concepts A and all individuals y \u2208 \u2206I , either y \u2208 AI or y \u2208 A\u0304I . Assume the contrary, i.e., there exists an individual y which belongs neither to AI nor to A\u0304I . Then, y violates all DIs (46)\u2013(49). Consider the interpretation I \u2032, obtained from I by setting (UA) I\u2032 = UI \u2032\n= {y}. By construction I \u2032 satisfies all CIs in KB. Compared to I, the status of the DIs is the same, except that in I \u2032 the individual y satisfies (48). Hence, I \u2032 <var I, which is a contradiction. Since each individual belongs to either AI or A\u0304I , we can convert I into a classical model of T , thus showing that T is satisfiable.\nSimilarly, for any given a \u2208 NI, T is satisfiable iff there exists a model I of Circvar(KB) such that aI 6\u2208 (\u2203R.U)I . Therefore, instance checking in Circvar(EL\u22a5) is ExpTime-hard as well.\nFinally, add a fresh concept name B and all the inclusions B u \u2203R.UA v \u22a5; call the new DKB KB\u2032. Note that T is satisfiable iff in some model of Circvar(KB) all UA\u2019s are empty, which holds iff B is satisfiable w.r.t. Circvar(KB\u2032). Consequently, concept satisfiability in Circvar(EL\u22a5) is ExpTime-hard. 2\nSince Circvar is a special case of CircF , and by Theorem 4.4, the above theorem applies to CircF and Circfix, too:\nCorollary 7.4 For X = F, fix, concept satisfiability checking, instance checking, and subsumption in CircX(EL\u22a5) are ExpTime-hard. These results still hold if ABoxes are empty (i.e. assertions are not allowed).\nFixed concept names can play a role similar to \u22a5, so that the above proof can be adapted to CircF (EL).\nTheorem 7.5 Instance checking and subsumption are ExpTime-hard both in CircF (EL) and in Circfix(EL). The same holds in the restriction of EL not supporting >.\nProof. We reduce satisfiability of an EL\u00acA TBox T to the complement of subsumption in CircF (EL). First we have to introduce a new concept name D representing > and translate each concept C in EL\u00acA into a corresponding C\u2217 in EL, as follows:\n\u2022 C\u2217 = C if C is a concept name;\n\u2022 C\u2217 = A\u0304 if C is \u00acA (for all A, A\u0304 is a new concept name);\n\u2022 C\u2217 = D u \u2203R.(C\u22171 uD) if C is \u2203R.C1;\n\u2022 C\u2217 = C\u22171 u C\u22172 if C is C1 u C2.\nEach C1 v C2 in T is translated into C\u22171 v C\u22172 . Then we extend the translated TBox with the following inclusions, where Bot (representing\u22a5), all UA\u2019s, and Bad are new concept names and R is a new role name:\nA v D (50) A\u0304 v D (51) UA v D (52)\nA u A\u0304 v Bot (53) A u UA v Bot (54) A\u0304 u UA v Bot (55)\nD vn A (56) D vn A\u0304 (57)\nD vn UA (58) D v D\u2032 (59) D\u2032 vn \u2203R.UA (60) D\u2032 vn \u2203R.Bot (61)\n\u2203R.UA v Bad (62) \u2203R.Bot v Bad (63)\nD(a) (ABox assertion) (64)\nLetKB = \u3008K,\u227aK\u3009 be the resulting DKB, and set F = {D,Bot}. We prove that the following three properties are equivalent: (i) T is satisfiable, (ii) CircF (KB) 6|= D v Bad , and (iii) CircF (KB) 6|= Bad(a).\nLet us prove that (ii) implies (i). Let I be a model of CircF (KB) with an individual x s.t. x \u2208 DI and x 6\u2208 BadI . By (62)\u2013(63), x 6\u2208 (\u2203R.UA)I for all A, and x 6\u2208 (\u2203R.Bad)I . By (59), x \u2208 (D\u2032)I . Hence, x violates DIs (60) and (61). Assume that at least one concept UA is not empty in I (resp., Bot is not empty in I). Then, I can be improved (according to <F ) by connecting with an R-edge the individual x with the non-empty concept UA (resp., Bot), and then adding x to Bad (notice that Bad is a variable concept). This being a contradiction, we conclude that Bot and all UA\u2019s are empty in I. Then, we prove that the restriction of I to the domain DI is a model of T .\nInclusions (50)\u2013(51) ensure that all individuals satisfying either A or A\u0304 are in DI . DIs (56)\u2013 (57), together with the fact that all UA\u2019s are empty, guarantee that each individual in DI satisfies either A or A\u0304, for all concept names A. Rules (53), together with the fact that Bot is empty, guarantee that no individual satisfies both A and A\u0304. The translation from C to C\u2217 completes our claim.\nNext, we show that (i) implies (ii). Let I be a model of T . We extend I to become a model J of CircF (KB) such that DJ 6\u2286 BadJ , because DJ 6= \u2205 and BadJ = \u2205. For each A, set A\u0304J = \u2206I \\ AI and UJA = \u2205. Then, set DJ = (D\u2032)J = \u2206J = \u2206I and Bot\nJ = BadJ = \u2205. It is easy to verify that J satisfies all CIs of KB. It remains to prove that J is minimal w.r.t. <F .\nSince Bot is a fixed concept, inclusions (53)\u2013(55) ensure that A, A\u0304 and UA are mutually exclusive, for all concepts A. Hence, each DI of type (56)\u2013(58) can only be improved at the expenses of another DI of incomparable priority, which does not count as an improvement according to <F . DI (61) cannot be improved because Bot is empty and fixed. Finally, suppose one tries to improve one of the DIs of type (60). To do so, at least one individual x must enter the concept UA. Due to the mutual exclusion property described earlier, x needs to exit from A (resp. A\u0304), thus violating DI (56) (resp., (57)), which has a higher priority than (60) due to (59).\nThe equivalence between (i) and (iii) can be proved along similar lines. Just notice that the fact (64) makes Bad(a) equivalent to the inclusion D v Bad . The thesis for Circfix is obtained as a consequence of Theorem 4.4. 2\nConcept consistency is simpler, instead. Call an interpretation I complete iff for all A \u2208 NC, AI = \u2206I , and for all P \u2208 NR, P I = \u2206I \u00d7\u2206I . It is not hard to verify that all EL concepts and all EL inclusions (both classical and defeasible) are satisfied by all x \u2208 \u2206I , therefore complete models are always models of CircF (KB), for all DKBs KB and all F \u2286 NC. As a consequence we have that concept consistency is trivial:\nTheorem 7.6 For all EL concepts C, DKBs KB, and F \u2286 NC, C is satisfied by some model of CircF (KB).\n7.1 Left Local EL\u22a5 and Circvar In this subsection and in the next one, we prove that qualified existentials in the left-hand side of inclusions are responsible for the higher complexity of EL\u22a5 w.r.t. DL-liteR. In particular, qualified existentials in the left-hand side make the proof strategy of Lemma 6.7 fail: when the target of an edge which starts in x is redirected, the individual x may satisfy a qualified existential restriction that it did not satisfy before. If so, the truth value of inclusions may be affected. By limiting the occurrences of qualified existential restrictions in the left-hand side of inclusions, it is possible to reduce significantly the complexity of instance checking and subsumption in circumscribed EL\u22a5. Figure 3 summarizes the syntactic fragments of EL\u22a5 that we consider. We start with the following class of knowledge bases:\nDefinition 7.7 A defeasible knowledge base \u3008K,\u227a\u3009 is in the full left local (LLf ) fragment of EL\u22a5 iff the left-hand sides of the inclusions of K contain no qualified existential restrictions.\nNote that this restriction rules out all the acyclic terminologies containing a qualified existential restriction, and hence most of the existing ontologies of practical interest. Therefore, we introduce the following relaxation of LLf EL\u22a5:\nDefinition 7.8 An EL\u22a5 knowledge base KB = \u3008K,\u227a\u3009 is almost LL (aLL for short) iff (i) K = KLL\u222aKa , (ii) KLL is in LLf , (iii) Ka is a classical acyclic terminology, and (iv) if a concept name A defined in Ka occurs in the left-hand side of an inclusion in KLL , then A does not depend (in Ka) on any qualified existential restriction.\nIn other words, by unfolding KLL with respect to Ka, we obtain a LLf knowledge base.\nExample 7.9 Example 3.1 can be reformulated in aLL EL\u22a5:\nHuman vn \u2203has lhs heart ; \u2203has lhs heart u \u2203has rhs heart v \u22a5 ; Situs Inversus \u2261 Human u \u2203has rhs heart .\nHere KLL consists of the first two axioms and Ka consists of the third axiom. Note that, in general, a concept nameA occurring in a terminology T can be extended with default properties by means of an inclusion A vn C in the following cases: A can be a primitive concept (with no definition in T ), or a concept partially defined by a one-way inclusion (e.g. Human v Mammal), or even a concept with a complete definition A \u2261 D in T , provided that A does not depend on any qualified existentials. Accordingly, in this example, we could add a defeasible inclusion like Situs Inversus vn C, that would not be permitted if the definition of situs inversus depended on qualified existential restrictions as in\nSitus Inversus \u2261 Human u \u2203has heart. \u2203has position. Right . 2\nA small model property similar to Lemma 6.7 can be proved for Circvar(aLL EL\u22a5) provided that the right-hand side of subsumption queries has bounded quantifier depth. It is convenient to split the proof into a proof for LLfEL\u22a5 and later extend it to aLL EL\u22a5 .\nSince in LLfEL\u22a5 the RHS of an inclusion may have nested qualified existential restrictions, it is difficult to prove the small model property when considering the entire language. For this reason, we prove it indirectly: first we show how to transform a knowledge base KB into another KB\u2217 that yields the following properties: (i) no nested formulas occur, (ii) defeasible inclusions are only of type A vn B, (iii) every model I \u2208 Circvar(KB) can be extended to a model of Circvar(KB\u2217) on the same domain and (iv) every model of Circvar(KB\u2217) is a model of Circvar(KB). Then, we prove a small model property for the fragment with no nesting and, thanks to properties (iii) and (iv), we recover the small model property for the entire language.\nEach LLfEL\u22a5 inclusion C v[n] D is transformed in three steps. Note that C\u2019s shape is:\nA1 u . . . uAn u \u2203R1 u . . . u \u2203Rm .\nIn the first step, C is replaced by a fresh concept name F0 (for convenience, we later refer to F0 also as FC) and the following axioms are added:\nFi v Ai+1 u . . . uAn u \u2203R1 u . . . u \u2203Rm (0 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u2212 1) (65) Ai+1 u Fi+1 v Fi (0 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u2212 2) (66)\nif m = 0, i.e., there are no existentials in C, add the inclusion:\nAn v Fn\u22121 (67)\nOtherwise, add the following inclusions:\nAn uG0 v Fn\u22121 (68) Gj v \u2203Rj+1 u . . . u \u2203Rm (0 \u2264 j \u2264 m\u2212 1) (69)\nBj+1 uGj+1 v Gj (0 \u2264 j \u2264 m\u2212 2) (70) Bm v Gm\u22121 (71) Bj v \u2203Rj (1 \u2264 j \u2264 m) (72) \u2203Rj v Bj (1 \u2264 j \u2264 m) (73)\nwhere the Fi, Gj and Bj are fresh concept names. At this point, the initial inclusion C v[n] D can be replaced by FC v[n] D. To eliminate the nesting in D, in the second step we replace it with a fresh concept name FD and add the inclusion FD v D\u2217, where \u00b7\u2217 is recursively defined as\nA\u2217 = A (74)\n(C uD)\u2217 = C\u2217 uD\u2217 (75) (\u2203R.H)\u2217 = \u2203R.FH and add FH v H\u2217, where FH is fresh. (76)\nFinally, in the third step, all inclusions of type A v D1 u . . . u Dh are split into A v Di, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 h. The resulting knowledge base, that we denote with KB\u2217, consists of instances of the following axiom schemata:\nA v[n] B A v \u2203P.B A1 uA2 v B \u2203P v B\nNow we prove the properties (iii) and (iv) mentioned above.\nLemma 7.10 Every model of Circvar(KB) can be extended to a model of Circvar(KB\u2217) on the same domain.\nProof. First, note that inclusions (65)\u2013(73) are definitorial, that is every interpretation I of KB has exactly one extension that satisfies them. This extension, for simplicity we continue to call it I, is obtained by setting F Ii = (Ai+1 u . . . u An u \u2203R1 u . . . u \u2203Rm)I , GIj = (\u2203Rj+1 u . . . u \u2203Rm)I and BIj = (\u2203Rj)I . Then, we can extend I by recursively setting F IH = HI , for each fresh concept FH introduced in step 2. It is straightforward to see by structural induction on H that (H\u2217)I = HI , and hence all inclusions in step 2 and 3 are satisfied. Thus, if I is a classical model of KB, then it is also a classical model of KB\u2217.\nAssume now that I is a model of Circvar(KB), we have to show that I is minimal also with respect to KB\u2217. Suppose not, and let J be a classical model of KB\u2217 such that J <KB\u2217,var I. By structural induction it is straightforward to see that for all C v[n] D in KB, (D\u2217)J \u2286 DJ . Since FJC = C\nJ holds for all fresh concept names FC occurring in the LHS of a rule, we have that for each inclusion C v[n] D in KB, satJ (FC v[n] FD) \u2286 satJ (C v[n] D) \u2014 which implies that J\nis a classical model of KB. Concerning I, for every C v[n] D in KB, we have (FC)I = CI and (FD)\nI = DI by construction, that is satI(C v[n] D) = satI(FC v[n] FD). The previous arguments entail that if satI(FC v[n] FD) \u2286 satJ (FC v[n] FD) (respectively satI(FC v[n] FD) \u2282 satJ (FC v[n] FD)), then satI(C v[n] D) \u2286 satJ (C v[n] D) (resp. satI(C v[n] D) \u2282 satJ (C v[n] D)). Therefore, it would follow that J <KB,var I, which contradicts the hypothesis. 2\nLemma 7.11 All models of Circvar(KB\u2217) are models of Circvar(KB).\nProof. The proof is similar to Lemma 7.10, in particular we already know that (i) if an individual satisfies an inclusion FC v[n] FD inKB\u2217, then it satisfies C v[n] D, and (ii) a classical model J of KB can be extended in such a way that satJ (C v[n] D) = satJ (FC v[n] FD), for each (possibly defeasible) inclusion in KB. From this, we have that every classical model of KB\u2217 is a classical model of KB and, by assuming that some classical model J of KB improves I (i.e. J <KB,var I), it follows that J can be extended into a classical model of KB\u2217 such that J <KB\u2217,var I. 2\nThe following result, whose proof can be found in the Appendix, represents a small model property for LLfEL\u22a5, which uses the above transformation of KB into KB\u2217.\nLemma 7.12 LetKB = \u3008K,\u227aK\u3009 be an LLfEL\u22a5 knowledge base, and C,D be EL\u22a5 concepts. For all models I \u2208 Circvar(KB) and for all x \u2208 CI \\DI there exists a model J \u2208 Circvar(KB) such that (i) \u2206J \u2286 \u2206I , (ii) x \u2208 CJ \\DJ , and (iii) |\u2206J | isO((|KB|2+|C|)d), where d = depth(D)+1.\nNow we have to extend the above result to aLL EL\u22a5 . First, we show under which conditions the concept names defined in Ka can be removed by unfolding them, using the unf operator defined in Section 2. The proofs of the following two propositions can be found in the Appendix.\nProposition 7.13 Let KB = \u3008KLL \u222a Ka,\u227a\u3009 be an aLL EL\u22a5 knowledge base. Every model of CircF (unf(KB)) can be extended to a model of CircF (KB).\nThe converse holds only if defined predicates are variable. The reason is that by adding a definition like A \u2261 \u2203P where A is fixed, one fixes the expression \u2203P , too, thereby changing its semantics.\nProposition 7.14 Let KB = \u3008KLL \u222a Ka,\u227a\u3009 be an aLL EL\u22a5 knowledge base and suppose that all the concept names defined in Ka are variable. Then, for all models I of CircF (KB), the restriction of I to primitive predicates is a model of CircF (unf(KB)).\nWith these lemmata we can prove:\nLemma 7.15 Let KB = \u3008K,\u227aK\u3009 be an aLL EL\u22a5 knowledge base (where K = Ka \u222a KLL) and let C,D be EL\u22a5 concepts. For all models I \u2208 Circvar(KB) and for all x \u2208 CI \\ DI there exists a model J \u2208 Circvar(KB) such that (i) \u2206J \u2286 \u2206I , (ii) x \u2208 CJ \\ DJ , and (iii) |\u2206J | is O((|KB|2 + |C|)d), where d = depth(D) + 1 + |Ka|2.\nProof. Let I \u2208 Circvar(KB) and x \u2208 CI \\DI . Let KB\u2032 = unf(KB), C \u2032 = unf(C,Ka), and D\u2032 = unf(D,Ka). Notice that KB\u2032 is a LLf knowledge base. By Proposition 7.14, the restriction I \u2032 of I to primitive predicates is a model of Circvar(KB\u2032). In particular, it holds that x \u2208 (C \u2032)I\n\u2032 \\(D\u2032)I\u2032 . By applying Lemma 7.12 toKB\u2032, C \u2032, D\u2032, and I \u2032, we obtain that there exists a model J of Circvar(KB\u2032) such that x \u2208 (C \u2032)J \\(D\u2032)J and |\u2206J | isO((|KB\u2032|2 + |C \u2032|)d\u2032), where d\u2032 = depth(D\u2032)+1. We have |KB\u2032|2 + |C \u2032| \u2264 |KB|2 + |C|, since replacing defined terms with their definitions can only decrease the total number of subformulas. Finally, depth(D\u2032) \u2264 depth(D) + \u2211 (A\u2261E)\u2208Ka depth(E) \u2264 depth(D) + |Ka|2, hence the thesis. 2\nConsequently we have that:\nTheorem 7.16 In Circvar(aLL EL\u22a5) concept satisfiability is in \u03a3p2. Moreover, deciding EL\u22a5 subsumptions C v D or instance checking problems D(a) with a constant bound on the quantifier depth of D\u2019s unfolding w.r.t. the given DKB is in \u03a0p2.\nProof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 6.2. 2\nCurrently, we do not know whether the bound on quantifier nesting is necessary to the above upper complexity bounds.\nNext we prove that the \u03a3p2 and \u03a0 p 2 upper bounds for Circvar are tight. Actually, a much simpler\nfragment suffices to reach that complexity:\nDefinition 7.17 An EL\u22a5 knowledge base is left local (LL) if its concept inclusions are instances of the following schemata:\nA v[n] \u2203P.B A1 uA2 v B \u2203P v B \u2203P1 v \u2203P2.B ,\nwhere A and B are either concept names or \u22a5. An LL EL\u22a5 concept is any concept that can occur in the above inclusions.\nSchema A v[n] B can be emulated in LL EL\u22a5 by the inclusions A v[n] \u2203R, \u2203R v B and B v \u2203R, for a fresh role R. Note the similarity of LL schemata with the normal form of EL inclusions (Baader et al., 2005) that, however, would allow the more general inclusions \u2203P.A v B and \u2203P1.A v \u2203P2.B (that are forbidden by left locality).\nNow we prove that reasoning in Circvar(LL EL\u22a5) is hard (and hence complete) for \u03a3p2 and \u03a0 p 2.\nFor this purpose, we provide a reduction of minimal entailment over positive, propositional disjunctive logic programs (PDLP), defined in Section 6.1. For each propositional variable pi, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, introduce two concept names Pi and P\u0304i \u2013 where the latter encodes \u00acpi. In the following we will denote by Lj , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 2n, a generic Pi or P\u0304i. For each clause cj \u2208 S introduce a concept name Cj . Then, two other concept names True and False represent the set of true and false literals respectively. Finally, the concept names Lit and Min are used to model minimal propositional assignments; we need also an auxiliary role R.\nFirst, literals are reified, i.e. modeled as individuals, with the axioms:\n> v \u2203R.Li (1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n) (77) Li u Lj v \u22a5 (1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 2n) (78)\nLi vn \u22a5 (1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n) (79)\nThe first axiom makes all Li nonempty. Axioms (78) make them pairwise disjoint. Finally, axioms (79) minimize the concepts Li and make them singletons. Then, we represent S by adding for each clause cj = lj1 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 ljh, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, the axioms\nLji v Cj (1 \u2264 j \u2264 m and 1 \u2264 i \u2264 h) (80) Cj vn \u22a5 (1 \u2264 j \u2264 m) (81)\n> v \u2203R.(Cj u True) (1 \u2264 j \u2264 m) (82)\nBy axioms (80) and (81), Cj equals the set of (encodings of) literals in cj . Axioms (82) make sure that each clause holds.\nIn order to model the concepts True and False and the correct meaning of complementary literals we add the axioms\nTrue u False v \u22a5 (83) Pi u True v \u2203R.(P\u0304i u False) (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) (84) Pi u False v \u2203R.(P\u0304i u True) (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) (85) P\u0304i u True v \u2203R.(Pi u False) (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) (86) P\u0304i u False v \u2203R.(Pi u True) (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) (87)\nThe axioms defined so far encode the classical semantics of S. To minimize models, add the following axioms:\nMin u Pi v False (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) (88) Min u P\u0304i v True (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) (89)\nLi v Lit (1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n) (90) Cj v Lit (1 \u2264 j \u2264 m) (91)\nLit vn Min (92)\nBy (88) and (89), Min collects false positive literals and true negative literals. By (90) and (91), Lit contains all the (representations of) literals and clauses. The purpose of these axioms is giving defeasible inclusions (79) and (81) higher (specificity-based) priority than (92), so that model minimization cannot cause any Li to be larger than a singleton, nor any Cj to be different from the set of literals of cj . Now (92) prefers those models where as many Pi as possible are in False .\nIn the following, given a PDLP S, let KBS be the Tbox defined above.\nLemma 7.18 Given a PDLP S, a literal l in S\u2019s language, and the encoding L of l, the following are equivalent:\n(minimal entailment) S |=min l;\n(subsumption) Circvar(KBS) |= > v \u2203R.(True u L);\n(co-sat) False u L is not satisfiable w.r.t Circvar(KBS);\n(instance checking) Circvar(KBS) |= (\u2203R.(True u L))(a).\nThis lemma can be proved by analogy with the proof of Lemma 6.5; the details are left to the reader. The conjunctions (u) nested in \u2203 can be easily replaced with a new atom A by adding the equivalence A \u2261 True u L, that can itself be encoded in LL EL\u22a5, so we have:\nTheorem 7.19 Subsumption and instance checking over Circvar(LL EL\u22a5) are \u03a0p2-hard; concept satisfiability is \u03a3p2-hard. These results hold even if the three reasoning tasks are restricted to LL EL\u22a5 concepts, and priorities are specificity-based.\n7.2 Left Local EL\u22a5 and Circfix By a reduction of the validity problem for quantified Boolean formula, we can show that Circfix(aLL EL\u22a5) is more complex than Circvar(aLL EL\u22a5), unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Computing the truth of a quantified Boolean formula\n\u03c8 = Q1p1 . . . Qnpn.\u03d5\n(where the Qi\u2019s are quantifiers) can be reduced in polynomial time to subsumption checking in Circfix(aLL EL\u22a5) as follows. Introduce concept names A0, . . . , An, Ti and Fi for i = 1 . . . n, and concept names Eji for 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n. Introduce role names R, bad , good , and Ui for i = 1 . . . n.\nWe define a aLLEL\u22a5 knowledge base \u3008K,\u227aK\u3009, where K = KLL \u222aKa. The left-local part KLL consists of the following groups of axioms. Notice that, in the following description, i is always an arbitrary index in {1, . . . , n}. First, we encode the negation normal form \u03d5\u0304 of \u00ac\u03d5. Let Bpi = Ti and B\u00acpi = Fi. For all subformulas F \u2227G of \u03d5\u0304 introduce a new concept name BF\u2227G and add the inclusion BF uBG v BF\u2227G. For all subformulas F \u2228G of \u03d5\u0304 introduce a new concept name BF\u2228G and add the inclusions BF v BF\u2228G and BG v BF\u2228G.\nThe second group of axioms of KLL constrains Ti and Fi to avoid inconsistencies. Intuitively \u2203Ui means \u201cpi is undefined\u201d:\nTi u Fi v \u22a5 (93) Ti u \u2203Ui v \u22a5 (94)\nFi u \u2203Ui v \u22a5 (95)\nThe third group of axioms of KLL defines a tree that encodes the truth assignments needed to evaluate the QBF:\nfor all i 6= j Ai uAj v \u22a5 (96) for all i s.t. Qi = \u2200 Ai\u22121 v \u2203R.(Ti uAi) u \u2203R.(Fi uAi) (97) for all i s.t. Qi = \u2203 Ai\u22121 v \u2203R.Ai (98)\nThe fourth group of axioms of KLL detects misrepresentations by forcing role bad to point to the nodes of the evaluation tree where something is going wrong (i.e. the truth assignment is incomplete, or some predicate changes value along a branch, or \u03d5 is false in a leaf).\n> vn \u2203bad .\u2203Ui (99) > vn \u2203bad .Eji (100) > vn \u2203bad .E\u0302ji (101) > vn \u2203bad .(B\u03d5\u0304 uAn) (102)\n(Eji and E\u0302 j i are defined in Ka below). Finally, good captures the absence of bad :\n\u2203bad u \u2203good v \u22a5 . (103)\nThe acyclic terminology Ka has the only purpose of detecting whether some propositional symbol changes its value along a path:\nEji \u2261 Aj\u22121 u Ti u \u2203R.(Aj u Fi) (104) E\u0302ji \u2261 Aj\u22121 u Fi u \u2203R.(Aj u Ti) . (105)\nLemma 7.20 Let I be a model of Circfix(KB) that satisfies A0 u \u2203good . For all i = 1 . . . n, all the individuals in \u2206I are contained in either T Ii or F I i .\nProof. First, by contradiction, assume that for some i = 1 . . . n and x \u2208 \u2206Ii , x is neither in F Ii nor in T Ii . Since axioms (93)-(95) do not prevent x from satisfying \u2203Ui and I must be minimal w.r.t. axiom (99), then the entire domain \u2206I satisfies \u2203bad .\u2203Ui. However, by axiom (103), this means that A0 u \u2203good is unsatisfiable against the hypothesis. 2\nLemma 7.21 Let I be a model of Circfix(KB) that satisfies A0 u \u2203good . If for some i = 1 . . . n, xi \u2208 (Ai uTi)I (respectively, x \u2208 (Ai uFi)I), then all paths {xi, xi+1, . . . , xn} such that xj \u2208 Aj and (xj\u22121, xj) \u2208 RI , where i < j \u2264 n, are contained in T Ii (resp., y \u2208 F Ii ).\nProof. Assume that xi \u2208 (AiuTi)I and {xi, xi+1, . . . , xn} 6\u2286 T Ii . This means that xi 6= xn and for some i < j \u2264 n, xj\u22121 \u2208 (Aj\u22121 u Ti)I and xj \u2208 (Aj\u22121 u Fi)I . Then, by axiom (104), xj\u22121 \u2208 Eji and since I must be minimal w.r.t. axiom (100) the entire domain \u2206I satisfies \u2203bad .Eji . However, by axiom (103), this means that A0 u \u2203good is unsatisfiable against the hypothesis. 2\nTheorem 7.22 Concept satisfiability, subsumption checking, and instance checking are PSPACEhard in Circfix(aLL EL\u22a5). The result still holds if the nesting level of existential restrictions is bounded by a constant, and the priority relation is empty.\nProof. In order to prove the theorem it suffices to show that the QBF \u03c8 is true iff A0 u \u2203good is satisfiable w.r.t. the above KB. [if ] Let I be a model of Circfix(KB) that satisfies A0 u \u2203good . Due to axioms (96)-(98), I must contain a DAG that starts with x (which is in (A0 u\u2203good)I) and, following the R-edges, proceeds through the concepts Ai of increasing index, up to An. In this DAG, for all i = 1 . . . n such that Qi = \u2200, individuals belonging to a AIi have two successors: one in AIi+1 \u2229 T Ii+1 and the other in AIi+1 \u2229 F Ii+1. Individuals in AIi , where Qi = \u2203, have only one successor, in AIi+1. Due to Lemma 7.20, such a successor is either in T Ii+1 or F I i+1.\nNow, consider any truth assignment v to the universally quantified variables of \u03c8. In the DAG, follow the unique path from x to a leaf z \u2208 AIn, that for each level i corresponding to a Qi = \u2200 proceeds withAIi+1\u2229T Ii+1 orAIi+1\u2229F Ii+1 in accordance with v. By Lemma 7.20, for all i = 1 . . . n z is in either Ti or Fi, moreover, by Lemma 7.21, membership of z in Ti or Fi is consistent with v. Therefore, z represents a full truth assignment of the variables in \u03c8 which extends v.\nNow, since I minimizes the set of abnormal individuals w.r.t. the defeasible inclusion (99) and in all models \u2203good and \u2203bad are disjoint, x \u2208 \u2203goodI implies that z 6\u2208 BI\u03d5\u0304. But then, it is straightforward to conclude that this truth assignment satisfies \u03d5.\n[only if ]. Assume that \u03c8 is true. Assume w.l.o.g. that odd quantifiersQ1, Q3, . . . , Qn\u22121 are universal and even quantifiers are existential. For each existential quantifier Qi, let fi : {T, F}i/2 \u2192 {T, F} be the function such that for all values v1, v3, . . . , vn\u22121 of the universally quantified variables, \u03d5(v1, f2(v1), v3, f4(v1, v3), . . . , fn(v1, v3, . . . , vn\u22121)) is true.\nWe define a tree-like model I of KB that satisfies A0 u \u2203good . We start with a root individual x, such that x |=I A0 u \u2203good . We proceed inductively as follows. For even i (including 0), each individual y \u2208 AIi has two R-successors y\u2032, y\u2032\u2032 \u2208 AIi+1, such that y\u2032 \u2208 T Ii and y\u2032\u2032 \u2208 F Ii (see axioms (97)). For odd i, each individual y \u2208 AIi has one R-successor y\u2032 \u2208 AIi+1 (see axioms (98)), such that y\u2032 satisfies either Ti or Fi, according to the value of fi when applied to the truth values that can be read along the path from the root to y. Along each R \u2212 path x0 . . . xi . . . xn the same concept Ti or Fi assigned to xi is assigned to all xj , with i < j \u2264 n, and indifferently either Ti or Fi is assigned to the xh with 1 \u2264 h \u2264 i. The model is completed by assigning to xn (i) BF\u2227G, for all subformulas F \u2227G of \u03d5\u0304, such that F and G are assigned to xn, and (ii) BF\u2228G, for all subformulas F \u2228G of \u03d5\u0304, such that F or G are assigned to xn.\nWe leave to the reader the proof that the structure just defined satisfies the classical part of KB. Regarding minimality w.r.t. the defeasible inclusions in KB, we remark the following. All the individuals violate inclusions (99). However, due to rules (94) and (95), the situation cannot be improved by simply modifying the roles. Similarly, all the individuals violate inclusions (100)- (101). However, since the Eji are all empty these defeasible inclusions cannot be improved.\nFinally, since each leaf z \u2208 An represents a truth assignment that satisfies \u03c6, then B\u03d5\u0304 is empty and hence our model is also minimal w.r.t. the inclusion (102). 2\nThe LL fragment of EL\u22a5, unlike LLf , does not fully support unqualified existential. Consequently, Theorem 4.4 cannot by used to transfer the hardness results of Theorem 7.19 from var to fix.9 The above hardness results hold only for the more general framework Circvar(LLf EL\u22a5) and hence, by Theorem 4.4,for Circfix(LLf EL\u22a5):\nProposition 7.23 Subsumption and instance checking over Circfix(LLf EL\u22a5) are \u03a0p2-hard; concept satisfiability is \u03a3p2-hard. These results hold even if queries contain only LL EL\u22a5 concepts, and priorities are specificity-based.\nThe following result, whose proof can be found in the Appendix, shows a context in which the above lower bounds are tight: namely, the case in which the priority relation is empty (i.e., DIs are mutually incomparable) and, for subsumption queries C v D or instance checking queries D(a), the quantifier depth of D is bounded by a constant.\nLemma 7.24 LetKB = \u3008KS\u222aKD, \u2205\u3009 be an LLfEL\u22a5 knowledge base, andC,D be EL\u22a5 concepts. For all models I \u2208 Circfix(KB) and for all x \u2208 CI \\DI there exists a model J \u2208 Circfix(KB) such that (i) \u2206J \u2286 \u2206I , (ii) x \u2208 CJ \\DJ (iii) |\u2206J | is O((|KB|+ |C|)d) where d = depth(D).\nGoing back to the LL fragment, in the following we prove that Circfix is less complex than Circvar (unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses). In particular, we show that Circfix(LLEL\u22a5) is tractable. Algorithm 1 takes as input a knowledge base KB and two concepts C and D (we may assume without loss of generality that C = AC u dn i=1 \u2203Pi.Bi) and checks whether Circfix(KB) |= C v D.\n9. We will prove below that in LL EL\u22a5, Circfix is actually less complex than Circvar.\nAlgorithm 1: Data: C = AC u dn 1 \u2203Pi.Bi, D, KB = \u3008K,\u227a\u3009.\nA := {A vn \u2203P.B | C |= A}; X := C; while A 6= \u2205 do\nremove from A a defeasible inclusion A vn \u2203P.B; if SupCls(\u2203P.B) \u2286 SupCls(C) and NonEmpty(\u2203P.B,KS) \u2286 NonEmpty(C,KS) then\nX := X u \u2203P.B; return X vKS D;\nWith SupCls(H) we mean the set of superclasses of a concept H , i.e., the set of B \u2208 NC \u222a {\u22a5} such that H vKS B.\nGiven a concept H , the operator NonEmpty(H,KS) represents the set of concepts that are forced to be non empty whenever H is. Note that this set includes some concepts that are forced to be non empty by the ABox in KB, independently from H . We write H ; A iff H vKS \u2203R.A for some R, and we denote by +; the transitive closure of ;. Then, NonEmpty(H,KS) is formally defined as follows:\nNE Kernel = {H} \u222a \u22c3 a\u2208NI{A | KS |= A(a)} \u222a \u22c3 a\u2208NI,R\u2208NR{A | KS |= (\u2203R.A)(a)}\nNonEmpty(H,KS) = \u22c3 A\u2208NE Kernel{A\u2032 | A + ; A\u2032}.\nRoughly speaking, the algorithm accumulates the RHS of defeasible inclusions actively satisfied by a witness of C. Then, it tries to derive D. In particular, a defeasible inclusion A vn \u2203R.B is actively satisfied just in the case (i) does not entail locally \u22a5 or a concept name not subsumed by C, and (ii) does not entail globally the non-emptiness of a concept name that should be empty. The rationale is that concept names are fixed and circumscription cannot change their extension as the application of A vn \u2203R.B could instead require.\nLemma 7.25 Circfix(KB) |= C v D holds iff Algorithm 1 returns true.\nProof. [if ] It suffices to show that for all models of Circfix(KB), X subsumes C, where X is the formula obtained after the while statement. Assume per absurdum that for some model I and an individual x \u2208 \u2206I , x \u2208 CI \\XI . This means that for some defeasible inclusionA \u2286n \u2203P.B (i) x 6\u2208 satI(A \u2286n \u2203P.B) and (ii) from line 1, SupCls(\u2203P.B) \u2286 SupCls(C) and NonEmpty(\u2203P.B,KS) \u2286 NonEmpty(C,KS).\nNote that, since NonEmpty(\u2203P.B,KS) \u2286 NonEmpty(C,KS), whenever \u2203R.B vKS \u2203S.B\u0304 there exists an individual yB\u0304 \u2208 B\u0304I . Let I \u2032 be the interpretation obtained from I by adding all such (x, yB\u0304). Clearly, by adding new arcs the set of individuals that satisfied a defeasible inclusion \u03b4 cannot decrease, therefore for all \u03b4 \u2208 KD, satI(\u03b4) \u2286 satI\u2032(\u03b4). Moreover, since x \u2208 (\u2203R.B)I \u2032 , satI(A \u2286n \u2203P.B) \u2282 satI\u2032(A \u2286n \u2203P.B) and hence I \u2032 <fix I. From condition (ii) and the fact that defeasible inclusions do not conflict with each other, it is easy to verify that I \u2032 is also a classical model of KB, but this would mean that I is not a model of Circfix(KB) against the hypothesis.\n[only if ] Assume that Algorithm 1 returns false. Let I be the following interpretation:\n\u2022 \u2206I = {xC} \u222a {xA | A \u2208 NonEmpty(C,KS)} \u222a {xa | a \u2208 NI};\n\u2022 for all B \u2208 NC, BI is the union of: (i) {xC} if B \u2208 S1, (ii) the set of xA, with A \u2208 S2, such that A |=KS B, and (iii) the set of xa, with a \u2208 NI, such that KS |= B(a);\n\u2022 for all R \u2208 NR, RI is the union of the pairs (i) (xA, xB) where A,B \u2208 S2 and A vKS \u2203R.B, (ii) (xa, xb) where a, b \u2208 NI and KS |= R(a, b), (iii) (xa, xB) where a \u2208 NI, B \u2208 S2 and KS |= \u2203R.B(a), (iv) (xC , xB) where B \u2208 S2 and X vKS \u2203R.B; other arcs are not relevant.\nBy construction I is a (classical) model of KS and xC \u2208 CI \\ DI , hence in order to prove I \u2208 Circfix(KB) it remains to show that I is minimal. Note that, since defeasible inclusions do not contain nested roles on the right side, the set of defeasible inclusions satisfied by an individual does not affect the set of defeasible inclusions satisfied by another individual. Therefore, an interpretation can be improved point-wise and we can assume w.l.o.g. that all the individuals in I, except xC , cannot be further improved. Assume now that there exists an interpretation J that improves I in xC , this means in particular that for some \u03b4 = A vn \u2203P.B, xC \u2208 satJ (\u03b4) \\ satI(\u03b4).\nThe assumption xC 6\u2208 satI(\u03b4) means that \u2203P.B does not satisfy the condition in line 1 and, since concept names are fixed, \u03b4 cannot be satisfied in J . 2\nTheorem 7.26 In Circfix(LL EL\u22a5) DKBs, LL EL\u22a5 subsumption, instance checking, and concept consistency are in P.\nProof. Since SupCls(H) and NonEmpty(H,KS) are based on classical reasoning, they can be performed in polynomial time. Moreover, the number of iterations in Algorithm 1 is bounded by the number of defeasible inclusions. Therefore, due to Lemma 7.25, the subsumption problem is tractable. By Theorem 3.9, instance checking and concept inconsistency can be reduced to subsumption. 2\nComplexity is low under Circfix because in this context LL axioms are not general enough to simulate quantifier nesting nor conjunctions of existential restrictions. In Circvar these features can be simulated by abbreviating compound concepts C with concept names A using equivalences A \u2261 C such that C does not depend on qualified existentials (hence the LL restriction is preserved). With Circfix, such equivalences change the semantics of C whenever C is (or contains) an existential restriction, because A is fixed and prevents C from varying freely. As we reintroduce the missing features, complexity increases again.\nLet LL2EL\u22a5 support the schemata: A v[n] \u2203P.B \u2203P1 u \u2203P2 v \u2203P3.B \u2203P v B\nOne may easily verify that LL2EL\u22a5 is equivalent to LL EL\u22a5 plus schema \u2203P1 u \u2203P2 v \u2203P3.B. The missing axioms can be reformulated using fresh roles R and suitable equivalences \u2203R \u2261 C (that preserve C\u2019s semantics because R is a varying predicate)10.\nWith these additional schemata, one can create conflicts between variable concepts, as in \u2203P1 u \u2203P2 v \u22a5. Then different defeasible inclusions may block each other, thereby creating a potentially exponential search space.\nTheorem 7.27 Subsumption and instance checking over Circfix(LL2EL\u22a5) are coNP-hard; concept satisfiability is NP-hard. These results hold even if the three reasoning tasks are restricted to LL2EL\u22a5 concepts, and priorities are specificity-based. 10. In particular, schema A1uA2 v B can be emulated by the inclusions A1 v \u2203R1, A2 v \u2203R2, B v \u2203R3, \u2203R1 v A1, \u2203R2 v A2, \u2203R3 v B, and \u2203R1 u \u2203R2 v \u2203R3.\nProof. By reduction of SAT. For each propositional variable pi introduce the concept names Ai, A\u0304i, and role Ui, representing pi\u2019s truth value (resp. true, false, and undefined). These alternatives are made mutually inconsistent with:\nAi u A\u0304i v \u22a5 Ai u \u2203Ui v \u22a5 A\u0304i u \u2203Ui v \u22a5\nFor each given clause cj = lj,1 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 lj,n, introduce a concept name C\u0304j representing cj\u2019s falsity, and for each L\u0304j,k representing the complement of lj,k add L\u0304j,1 u \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 u L\u0304j,n v C\u0304j .\nDefine a concept name F\u0304 representing the falsity of the given set of clauses, and a disjoint concept F with:\nC\u0304j v F\u0304 (for all input clauses cj) F\u0304 u F v \u22a5 .\nNow, with a defeasible inclusion, \u2203Ui is forced to be true for all individuals that satisfy neither Ai nor A\u0304i; moreover, a role U detects undefined literals:\n> vn \u2203Ui \u2203Ui v \u2203U .\nLet K be the above set of inclusions and KB = \u3008K,\u227aK\u3009. It can be proved that the given set of clauses S is unsatisfiable iff Circfix(KB) |= F v \u2203U , therefore subsumption checking is coNPhard.\nSimilarly, it can be proved that S is unsatisfiable iff Circfix(KB\u2032) |= (\u2203U)(a), where KB\u2032 = \u3008K\u2032,\u227aK\u2032\u3009 and K\u2032 = K \u222a {F (a)}; therefore instance checking is coNP-hard.\nFinally, it can be proved that S is satisfiable iff F u\u2203OK is satisfiable w.r.t. Circfix(KB\u2032\u2032), where KB\u2032\u2032 = \u3008K\u2032\u2032,\u227aK\u2032\u2032\u3009 and K\u2032\u2032 = K\u222a {\u2203U u \u2203OK v \u22a5}; therefore satisfiability checking is NP-hard.\nWe are only left to remark that K can be easily encoded in LL2EL\u22a5. 2\nWe prove that this bound is tight using Algorithm 2. The algorithm non-deterministically looks for an individual x (in some model) that satisfies C and not D. S1 guesses any additional fixed concept names satisfied by x; S2 guesses the concept names that are satisfied somewhere in the model (not necessarily by x) and finally \u227a\u2032 guesses a total extension of \u227a that determines the application order of GDIs.\nSimilarly to Algorithm 1, Algorithm 2 selects the defeasible inclusions that are active in x and accumulates in the formula X the RHS of those that are not blocked, i.e. do not require to change the interpretation of the concept names neither locally nor globally. The major differences are that (i) defeasible inclusions are extracted according to \u227a\u2032 and (ii) in line 2 the entire accumulated formula X u \u2203P.B is used to check that a defeasible inclusion is not blocked.\nFinally, note that the variable part of C (i.e. dn i=1 \u2203Pi.Bi) is introduced in X only in line 8, after all defeasible inclusions have been applied, because defeasible inclusions can influence the variable part (e.g. by forcing it to be empty).\nLemma 7.28 Circfix(KB) |= C v D holds iff all the runs of Algorithm 2 return true.\nProof.

In a similar way it can be proved that I is a classical model of KS and xC \u2208 CI \\DI . Assume now that I is improved by an interpretation J , w.l.o.g. we can also assume that (i) for some \u03b4 = A vn \u2203P.B, xC \u2208 satJ (\u03b4) \\ satI(\u03b4) and (ii) for all \u03b4\u2032 with higher priority than \u03b4 or not comparable with it, we have xC \u2208 satJ (\u03b4\u2032) iff xC \u2208 satI(\u03b4\u2032).\nIf X\u2032 is the value of X when \u03b4 is extracted on line 2 of Algorithm 2, since \u03b4\u2032 \u227a \u03b4 implies \u03b4\u2032 \u227a\u2032 \u03b4, all the \u03b4\u2032 already extracted have higher priority or are not comparable with \u03b4.

Related Work", "text": "DLs have been extended with nonmonotonic constructs such as default rules (Straccia, 1993; Baader & Hollunder, 1995a, 1995b), autoepistemic operators (Donini et al., 1997, 2002), and circumscription (Cadoli, Donini, & Schaerf, 1990; Bonatti et al., 2009, 2009; Bonatti, Faella, & Sauro, 2010). An articulated comparison of these approaches can be found in the work of Bonatti, Lutz, and Wolter (2009).\nMost of these approaches concern logics whose reasoning tasks\u2019 complexity lies beyond PH (unless the hierarchy collapses). For example, the logics considered by Donini et al. (1997, 2002) range from PSPACE to 3-ExpTime. The circumscribed DLs studied by Cadoli et al. (1990) as well\nas Bonatti et al. (2009) range from NPNExp to NExpNP. Some logics are undecidable (Baader & Hollunder, 1995a; Bonatti et al., 2009).\nA pioneering approach to low-complexity, circumscribed description logics was presented by Cadoli et al. (1990). That approach applies non-prioritized circumscription to a fragment of the description logic ALE . Decidability of reasoning is shown by a reduction to propositional reasoning under the Extended Closed World Assumption (ECWA), which is in \u03a0p2. To the best of our knowledge, that was the first effective reasoning method for a nonmonotonic description logic.\nA hybrid of Circfix(EL\u22a5) and closed world assumption has been proved to be in PTIME (Bonatti et al., 2010). On the one hand, that approach imposes less restrictions on the structure of inclusions; on the other hand, it cannot be fully extended to variable predicates without affecting tractability.\nA recent approach that is similar in spirit to circumscription has been taken by Giordano et al. (2008). They extend ALC with a modal operator T representing typicality, and maximize T \u2019s extension to achieve nonmonotonic inferences. Decidability is proved via a tableau algorithm that also establishes a co-NExpTimeNP upper bound for subsumption. No matching lower bounds are given; it is proved that reasoning in the underlying monotonic logic is NP-hard.\nFinally, an approach based on rational closures andALC can be found in the work of Casini and Straccia (2010). An appealing feature of this approach is that reasoning can be reduced to classical inference. Complexity is not increased by nonmonotonic reasoning: it ranges from PSPACE to ExpTime."}, {"heading": "9. Discussion and Future Work", "text": "The main complexity results of this paper are summarized in Table 1. By restricting circumscribed KBs to Circvar(DL-liteR), complexity decreases significantly (from (co)-NExpTimeNP to the second level of PH). The same complexity upper bounds hold in Circfix(DL-liteR) whenever the priority\nrelation is empty or the defeasible inclusions admit only concept names on the LHS. However, the general case is still an open question.\nOn the contrary, restricting the language to EL or EL\u22a5 does not in general suffice to bring complexity within PH. In particular, it can be proved that reasoning tasks are undecidable in Circ\u2217F (EL) (i.e., when roles can be fixed) and that reasoning in Circfix(EL) and Circvar(EL\u22a5) is in general ExpTime-hard.\nThe main source of the higher complexity of the EL family (w.r.t. DL-liteR) has been identified by introducing a further restriction called full left locality (LLf ) that suffices to confine complexity within the second level of PH under Circvar with specificity-based priorities, provided that the quantifier nesting level in subsumption queries and instance checking queries is suitably bounded (no restrictions are needed on concept satisfiability).\nSince the left locality restriction rules out acyclic terminologies (which are commonly used in ontologies), it has been relaxed to almost left local (aLL) knowledge bases, that support acyclic terminologies with the restriction that unfolding (i.e., the process of replacing the atoms defined in the acyclic terminology with their definition) should yield a LLf knowledge base. Reasoning becomes PSPACE-hard, in general; however in the aLL fragment of Circvar (and under the same assumptions needed for LLf ), reasoning remains complete for the second level of PH. In particular, the assumption that the priorities are determined by specificity is essential: By Theorem 4.5, general priorities make Circvar at least as complex as Circfix, that is, PSPACE-hard.\nWe have also analyzed the complexity of several fragments lying between LL and aLL under Circfix. These results provide some further information about the complexity sources in circumscribed DLs. For example, quantifier nesting in the KB is partially responsible for complexity (presumably because it enables conflicts between the default properties of different individuals): in particular, by removing quantifier nesting (i.e., by restricting KBs to the LL2 fragment) complexity drops to the first level of PH. The other source of complexity, of course, is due to the conflicts between defeasible inclusions concerning each individual in isolation; in Circfix(LLEL\u22a5) a defeasible inclusion can never block another inclusion (because fixed predicates prevent this) and\u2014as a consequence\u2014complexity drops within PTIME.\nWe have also proved that in all fragments that fully support unqualified existential restrictions, variable concept names can be eliminated. Moreover, in EL\u22a5 and its various left local fragments, compound concepts can be replaced with concept names in the left-hand side of defeasible inclusions, without affecting expressiveness. In the same fragments, general priorities can be simulated using only specificity-based priorities.\nWe have to leave several interesting questions open: First, it is not clear whether general priorities are necessary to the hardness results for DL-liteR; in particular, it would be interesting to establish the exact complexity of DL-liteR with specificity-based priorities. Other gaps in the complexity of circumscribed DL-liteR concern the complexity of Circfix with unrestricted GDIs or nonempty priority relations, and the complexity of reasoning with fixed roles. The next interesting question is whether the bound on quantifier nesting in the queries is actually needed to confine complexity of circumscribed EL\u22a5 within the second level of PH. Finally, there is no exact charcterization of the complexity of Circfix(LLf EL\u22a5) and of the fragments whose complexity lies beyond PH.\nFor the fragments that do belong to the second level of PH, we see an interesting opportunity of encoding reasoning in ASP and use some well-engineered engine such as DLV (Eiter, Leone, Mateis, Pfeifer, & Scarcello, 1997) to test scalability. In order to evaluate implementations experimentally, it is necessary to set up suitable benchmarks that, in a first stage, must necessarily be\nsynthetic problems, since nonmonotonic KBs have not been supported so far. Of course, identifying meaningful criteria for problem generation is a nontrivial issue. Therefore, systematic experimental evaluations still require a significant body of work."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors wish to thank Frank Wolter for granting the permission to publish his undecidability proof.

Additional Lemmas and Proofs", "text": "A.1 Proofs for Section 6\nLemma 6.3. Given a PDLP S over PV = {p1, . . . , pn} and a truth assignment I \u2286 PV , I is a minimal model of S iff the interpretation model(S, I,\u2206) is a model of Circvar(KBS), for all domains \u2206 with |\u2206| = 2n+ 1.\nProof. [only if ] Let I = model(S, I,\u2206), we first show that I is a model of the classical part of KBS . Since I-V, the Abox (18) and all axioms (20-24) are satisfied. Whereas, axioms (33-36) follow directly from VII.\nSince I is an interpretation, VI assures that if TrueP I 6= \u2205, then FalseP\u0304 I 6= \u2205. Together with VIII, axioms (31-32) are satisfied, whereas together with VII, True and False reflect in I the truth values of I; therefore TrueI \u2229 FalseI = \u2205 and hence axiom (30) is satisfied. Moreover, as I is a model of S, for each c \u2208 S there exists at least one literal li occurring in c such that I |= li. Due to V-VII, CIj \u2229 TrueI 6= \u2205 and, due to VII and VIII (where X = True and Y = Cj), I satisfies axioms (26-29).\nIt remains to prove that there exists no interpretation J such that J <var I. As \u2206I is finite, we can assume w.l.o.g. that J is a model of KBS . Assume that for some 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n, satI(Li vn \u00acLi) \u2282 satJ (Li vn \u00acLi), this is equivalent to saying that LJi \u2282 LIi , but since LIi is a singleton, LJi would be empty contradicting axioms (18-23). Similarly, satI(Cj vn \u00acCj) \u2282 satJ (Cj vn \u00acCj) iff CJj \u2282 CIj . Thus, due to V some axiom Lji v Cj would not be satisfied in J . Therefore the defeasible inclusions with highest priority cannot be improved.\nNow assume that for each literal and clause concept it holds LJi = L I i = {di} and C J j = C I j . Since I reflects the truth values of I , all the di\u2019s that are not included in FalseLIi are included in TrueLIi . Thus, if for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n, satI(Pi vn FalsePi) were equal to satJ (Pi vn FalsePi) then there would be no way for J to improve a defeasible inclusion Pi vn TruePi. Therefore, the only possibility so far is that J improves some instance of (40).\nNote that TrueJ and FalseJ are a partition of \u22c3 i P J i . Otherwise, we could set a P J i without truth value (i.e., di 6\u2208 TruePJi \u222aFalseP J i ) to FalsePi \u2014 since no classical inclusion is jeopardized we would obtain an improvement of J according to (40), against the hypothesis that J is a model. Due to (31-36), TrueJ and FalseJ are a partition of all {d1, . . . , d2n}.\nThus, we can consider the propositional assignment J such that pi \u2208 J iff PJi \u2286 TrueJ . First, for all clauses cj , since J satisfies axioms (26-29), for some 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n we have\nLJi \u2286 C J j \u2229TrueJ . As L J i = L I i and C J j = C I j , ljl occurs in cj . But this means that J |= li, and\nhence J |= cj . Thus, J is a model of S. Finally, as said before, if J <var I, then the intersection of\u22c3 i P I i and False I is strictly contained in the intersection of \u22c3 i P J i and False\nJ . This implies that J \u2282 I , against the hypothesis that I is a minimal model.\n[if ] Assume that I = model(S, I,\u2206) is a model of Circvar(KBS). First we show that I is a model of S, i.e., for all cj \u2208 S, I |= cj . As I satisfies axioms (26-29), for some 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n it holds di \u2208 CIj \u2229 TrueI . Due to IV and V, di belongs to some LIi such that the corresponding literal li occurs in cj . According to VI, this implies that I |= li, and hence I |= cj .\nIt remains to show that I is a minimal model. Assume that there exists a model J of S such that J \u2282 I , without loss of generality we can assume that J is minimal model. Let J = model(S, J,\u2206), from the above arguments J is a model of KBS . Furthermore, satJ (\u03b4) = satI(\u03b4) for each \u03b4 of type Li vn \u00acLi or Cj vn \u00acCj . Finally, as TrueJ and FalseJ reflect the truth values of J ,\u22c3 i P I i \u2229 FalseI \u2282 \u22c3 i P J i \u2229 FalseJ and hence J <var I due to the improvement of DIs (40). 2\nLemma 6.4. If I is a model of Circvar(KBS), then there exist a minimal model I of S such that pi \u2208 I iff P Ii \u2286 TrueI iff P\u0304 Ii \u2286 FalseI , for all i = 1, . . . , n.\nProof. Let I be a model of Circvar(KBS). First, we show that LIi is a singleton, for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n. Assume the contrary. Clearly, to satisfy (18\u201321), each LIi has to be nonempty. Therefore, for some 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, LIk contains at least two individuals. We will show that there exists an interpretation I \u2032 that improves I.\nFor all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n, let di be an arbitrary element of LIi , and let \u2206 = {d1, . . . , d2n} \u222a {aI}. As the LIi are disjoint with each other (see axioms (22)) and NonEmpty\nI is disjoint with any LIi , we have |\u2206| = 2n+ 1.\nAll PDLP are satisfiable, thus there exists a model I\u0302 of S. Let I\u0302 = model(S, I\u0302,\u2206). Let I \u2032 be an interpretation such that: (i) \u2206I \u2032 = \u2206I , (ii) for all roles R, RI \u2032 = \u2206I \u00d7 \u2206I , (iii) I \u2032 coincides with I\u0302 on \u2206 with respect to all concept names, and (iv) all the other individuals d \u2208 \u2206I \\\u2206 do not belong to any concept name. It is straightforward to see that I \u2032 satisfies the classical part of KBS . Furthermore, by construction, (a) for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n, LI\u2032i \u2286 LIi ; (b) for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, CI \u2032 j \u2286 CIj ; (c) for some 1 \u2264 l \u2264 2n, LI\u2032l \u2282 LIl . Thus, I \u2032 <var I, due to the improvement of DI (23). By the above argument, we have LIi = {di}. Define the truth valuation I = {pi | di \u2208 TrueI}. It remains to prove that I is a minimal model of S. The fact that I is a model of S is ensured by axioms (24\u201329). Then, assume by contradiction that there exists a model J of S that is smaller than I (i.e., J \u2282 I), and let J = model(S, J,\u2206). From J we can build an interpretation J \u2032 with \u2206J \u2032 = \u2206I and such that J \u2032 is a classical model of KBS and J \u2032 <var I, thus contradicting the hypothesis that I is a model of Circvar(KBS). We define J \u2032 by copying from J all the properties (concepts and roles) of the individuals in \u2206J = \u2206, and by leaving all the individuals in \u2206I \\\u2206 out of concept and role extensions. 2\nA.2 Proofs for Section 7\nGiven a KB K, an interpretation I, and an individual z, recall the definition of KB[z] from Section 6.2. Redefine the notion of \u201csupport\u201d as follows: supp I(C) is the set of individuals z \u2208 \u2206I such that > vKB[z] C holds.\nLemma 7.12. LetKB = \u3008K,\u227aK\u3009 be an LLfEL\u22a5 knowledge base, and C,D be EL\u22a5 concepts. For all models I \u2208 Circvar(KB) and for all x \u2208 CI \\DI there exists a model J \u2208 Circvar(KB) such that (i) \u2206J \u2286 \u2206I , (ii) x \u2208 CJ \\DJ , and (iii) |\u2206J | isO((|KB|2+|C|)d), where d = depth(D)+1.\nProof. Given two individuals x and y in \u2206I , the distance d(x, y) is the minimal length of role-paths from x to y. Let KB\u2217 be the knowledge base obtained from KB by applying the transformation presented in Section 7. Notice that |KB\u2217| \u2264 |KB|2.\nBy Lemma 7.10, I can be extended into a model of Circvar(KB\u2217), which we continue to call I for convenience. We define a small model J of Circvar(KB\u2217) such that x \u2208 CJ \\ DJ . Then, we obtain the thesis by Lemma 7.11.\nWe start from an initial domain \u2206J that contains (i) x; (ii) all aI , where a \u2208 NI occurs in KB\u2217; (iii) for all concepts H \u2208 cl(KB\u2217) \u222a cl(C) such that HI 6= \u2205, a witness yH \u2208 HI ; (iv) for all concepts H \u2208 cl(KB\u2217) \u222a cl(C) such that supp I(H) 6= \u2205, a witness wH \u2208 supp I(H).\nWe expand J by exhaustively applying the following rule (where \u2203P is a special case of \u2203P.H with H = >):\nLet y \u2208 \u2206J and \u2203P.H \u2208 cl(KB\u2217) \u222a cl(C) be such that y \u2208 (\u2203P.H)I and y 6\u2208 (\u2203P.H)J . If d(x, y) < d, then add z to \u2206J and (y, z) to PJ , where z is such that (y, z) \u2208 P I and z \u2208 HI . Otherwise, add (y, yH) to PJ .\nFinally, for each concept name A, set AJ = \u2206J \u2229AI . With respect to the cardinality of \u2206J , note that initially the number of individuals in \u2206J is O(|KB\u2217|+ |C|). During the expansion, for each individual whose distance from x is less than d, at most O(|KB\u2217| + |C|) new individuals are added. This means that |\u2206J | = O((|KB\u2217| + |C|)d) = O((|KB|2 + |C|)d).\nBy construction for each individual y \u2208 \u2206J andH \u2208 cl(KB\u2217)\u222acl(C) if y \u2208 HI , then y \u2208 HJ . In particular, in caseH = \u2203P , also the inverse holds, if y \u2208 \u2203PJ , then y \u2208 \u2203P I . From the previous two facts it immediately follows that J is a classical model of KB\u2217 and x \u2208 CJ . Moreover, since up to a distance d from x, PJ is contained in P I , for all P \u2208 NR, it is easy to see that x 6\u2208 DJ .\nIt remains to show that J is minimal. Assume by contradiction that for some classical model J \u2032 of KB\u2217, it holds J \u2032 <var J , we show that there exists a classical model I \u2032 of KB\u2217 such that I \u2032 <var I \u2014 against the hypothesis that I \u2208 Circvar(KB\u2217).\nWe distinguish two cases: in the first cas, all individualswH introduced in clause (iv) still satisfy the corresponding concept H in J \u2032; in the second case, at least one wH does not satisfy its concept H . We define I \u2032 as follows. In both cases, individual names are interpreted as in I and concept names for individuals in \u2206J are interpreted as in J \u2032.\nIn the first case, an individual z \u2208 \u2206I \\\u2206J satisfies a concept name A, that is z \u2208 AI\u2032 , if and only if z \u2208 supp I(A). Moreover, for each P \u2208 NR, P I \u2032 is the minimal set such that:\n1. PJ \u2032 \u2286 P I\u2032 ;\n2. if z \u2208 \u2206I \\\u2206J and z \u2208 supp I(\u2203P.H), and y \u2208 HJ \u2032 then (z, y) \u2208 P I\u2032 .\nWe prove that I \u2032 is a classical model of KB\u2217. Since I \u2032 is a copy of J \u2032 over \u2206J and J \u2032 is a classical model, we only need to show that the individuals z \u2208 \u2206I \\ \u2206J satisfy all the strong inclusions in KS. Note that if z satisfies in I \u2032 the LHS H of a strong inclusion, then z supports H in I. By definition, z supports also the RHS in I. If the RHS is a concept name B, then z \u2208 BI\u2032 by construction. Otherwise, i.e., if the RHS is \u2203P.H , by step 2 above, it suffices to show that HJ \u2032\nis not empty. However, by assumption, the witness of \u2203P.H introduced in clause (iv) still satisfies \u2203P.H in J \u2032. Therefore, there exists an individual y satisfying H in J \u2032.\nNext, we prove that I \u2032 <var I. Since J \u2032 <var J , it suffices to show that an individual z \u2208 \u2206I\\\u2206J satisfies in I \u2032 all the defeasible inclusions it satisfies in I. Assume that a DI \u03b4 = (A vn B)\nis satisfied by z in I. If z \u2208 AI\u2032 , then by construction z \u2208 supp I(A). Clearly, if z \u2208 supp I(A) and z \u2208 satI(A vn B), then z \u2208 supp I(B). Therefore, z \u2208 BI \u2032 .\nWe are left to prove the theorem for the second case, i.e.: at least one wH does not satisfy its concept H . Clearly, wH does not support H in J \u2032 anymore. In particular, there must be a DI \u03b4 such that wH \u2208 satJ (\u03b4) \\ satJ \u2032(\u03b4). From J \u2032 <var J , it follows that there must be a DI \u03b4\u2032 such that \u03b4\u2032 \u227aK \u03b4 and satJ (\u03b4\u2032) \u2282 satJ \u2032(\u03b4\u2032). Now, in I \u2032 we can safely violate all DIs whose priority is lower than \u03b4\u2032, and in particular all DIs whose LHS classically subsumes >. Then, complete the definition of I \u2032 as follows. Each basic concept A holds in an individual z \u2208 \u2206I \\\u2206J if and only if> vKS A. For each P \u2208 NR, P I \u2032 is the minimal set such that\n1. PJ \u2032 \u2286 P I\u2032 ;\n2. if z \u2208 \u2206I \\\u2206J , > vKS \u2203P.H , and y \u2208 HJ \u2032 then (z, y) \u2208 P I\u2032 .\nIt is easy to verify that I \u2032 is a classical model of KB\u2217. In order to prove that I \u2032 <var I, note that the following two facts hold.\nFirst, an individual z \u2208 \u2206I \\\u2206J satisfies all the DIs whose priority is not minimal. Assume that \u03b41 \u227aK \u03b42, for some DIs \u03b41 and \u03b42, this means that the LHS of \u03b42 subsumes the LHS of \u03b41 but not the vice versa. Then, the LHS of \u03b41 does not subsume > and hence, by construction, z vacuously satisfies \u03b41.\nSecond, if z violates a DI \u03b4\u2032\u2032 = (A vn B), then \u03b4\u2032 \u227aK \u03b4\u2032\u2032. As before, since \u03b4\u2032 \u227aK \u03b4, its LHS does not subsume >. However, since z violates \u03b4\u2032\u2032, z \u2208 AI\u2032 and hence A subsumes >. Therefore, \u03b4\u2032 \u227aK \u03b4\u2032\u2032.\nFrom the first fact it immediately follows that satI(\u03b4\u2032) \u2282 satI\u2032(\u03b4\u2032). Assume now, that for some \u03b4\u2032\u2032, satI(\u03b4\u2032\u2032) 6\u2286 satI\u2032(\u03b4\u2032\u2032). If there exists an individual z \u2208 \u2206I \\ \u2206J such that z \u2208 satI(\u03b4\u2032\u2032) \\ satI\u2032(\u03b4\n\u2032\u2032), then by the second fact \u03b4\u2032 \u227aK \u03b4\u2032\u2032. Otherwise, there must exist an individual w \u2208 \u2206J such that w \u2208 satI(\u03b4\u2032\u2032) \\ satI\u2032(\u03b4\u2032\u2032). However, in \u2206J the set of DIs that an individual satisfies in I (resp. I \u2032) is the same set of DIs it satisfies in J (resp. J \u2032). This means that there exists a defeasible inclusion \u03b4\u2032\u2032\u2032 such that \u03b4\u2032\u2032\u2032 \u227aK \u03b4\u2032\u2032 and satJ (\u03b4\u2032\u2032\u2032) \u2282 satJ \u2032(\u03b4\u2032\u2032\u2032). Due to the first fact, \u03b4\u2032\u2032\u2032 is satisfied in all \u2206I \\\u2206J , and hence satI(\u03b4\u2032\u2032\u2032) \u2282 satI\u2032(\u03b4\u2032\u2032\u2032). 2\nProposition 7.13. Let KB = \u3008KLL \u222a Ka,\u227a\u3009 be an aLL EL\u22a5 knowledge base. Every model of CircF (unf(KB)) can be extended to a model of CircF (KB).\nProof. Let Kunf = unf(KB) = \u3008K\u2032,\u227a\u2032\u3009. Let I be any model of CircF (Kunf). Extend it to a classical model J of K\u2032 \u222a Ka by setting AJ = DJ for all definitions A \u2261 D in Ka. Note that K\u2032 \u222a Ka is classically equivalent to KLL \u222a Ka. Now suppose that J is not a model of CircF (KB). Since by construction J is a classical model of Ka and the strong axioms of KLL, there must be a classical model J \u2032 of the same axioms such that J \u2032 <F J . By restricting J \u2032 to primitive predicates (i.e., predicates that are not defined in Ka), we obtain a classical model I \u2032 of K\u2032. Note that for all defeasible inclusions \u03b4 \u2208 KLL, it holds satJ \u2032(\u03b4) = satJ \u2032(unf(\u03b4,Ka)) = satI\u2032(unf(\u03b4,Ka)) and satJ (\u03b4) = satJ (unf(\u03b4,Ka)) = satI(unf(\u03b4,Ka)). It follows that I \u2032 <F I, a contradiction. 2\nProposition 7.14. Let KB = \u3008KLL \u222a Ka,\u227a\u3009 be an aLL EL\u22a5 knowledge base and suppose that all the concept names defined in Ka are variable. Then, for all models I of CircF (KB), the restriction of I to primitive predicates is a model of CircF (unf(KB)).\nProof. Let Kunf = unf(KB) = \u3008K\u2032,\u227a\u2032\u3009. Let J be the restriction of I to primitive predicates. In other words, J is obtained from I by dropping the interpretation of all concept names defined in Ka, which are all variable. It can be easily verified that J is a classical model of K\u2032. Suppose by contradiction that J is not a model of CircF (Kunf); then there exists a classical model J \u2032 of K\u2032 such that J \u2032 <F J . Now extend J \u2032 to a model I \u2032 of KLL \u222a Ka by setting AI \u2032 = DI \u2032 for all definitions A \u2261 D in Ka. Since the predicates defined in Ka are variable, all fixed predicates preserve their extensions across I, J , J \u2032, and I \u2032. Moreover, for all defeasible inclusions \u03b4 \u2208 KLL, we have satI\u2032(\u03b4) = satI\u2032(unf(\u03b4,Ka)) = satJ \u2032(unf(\u03b4,Ka)) and satI(\u03b4) = satI(unf(\u03b4,Ka)) = satJ (unf(\u03b4,Ka)). It follows that I \u2032 <F I, a contradiction. 2\nGiven a knowledge base KB, an interpretation I and a concept D, again we have to override the notion of support; supp I(D) is the set of z \u2208 \u2206I such that( l\nz\u2208AI A ) vKB[z] D .\nClearly, if I is a classical model of KB and z \u2208 supp I(D), then z \u2208 DI .\nLemma 7.24. LetKB = \u3008KS\u222aKD, \u2205\u3009 be an LLfEL\u22a5 knowledge base, andC,D be EL\u22a5 concepts. For all models I \u2208 Circfix(KB) and for all x \u2208 CI \\DI there exists a model J \u2208 Circfix(KB) such that (i) \u2206J \u2286 \u2206I , (ii) x \u2208 CJ \\DJ (iii) |\u2206J | is O((|KB|+ |C|)d) where d = depth(D).\nProof. Define the \u201csmall\u201d model J as in the proof of Lemma 7.12, using the new definition of support. Regarding the size of J and the fact that it is a classical model of KB, the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma 7.12 apply. In particular, it holds |\u2206J | = O((|KB|+ |C|)d).\nIt remains to show that J is<fix-minimal. Assume by contradiction that for some interpretation J \u2032, it holds J \u2032 <fix J ; as usual, we show that there exists I \u2032, such that I \u2032 <fix I. Let I \u2032 be defined as follows: \u2206I \u2032 = \u2206I ; aI \u2032 = aI , for all a \u2208 NI; AI \u2032 = AI , for all A \u2208 NC; P I \u2032 is the minimal set such that:\n\u2022 PJ \u2032 \u2286 P I\u2032 , and\n\u2022 for all z \u2208 \u2206I\u2032 \\ \u2206J \u2032 , for all y \u2208 \u2206J \u2032 and for all \u2203P.H \u2208 cl(KB) such that z \u2208 supp I(\u2203P.H), if y \u2208 HI \u2032 , then (z, y) \u2208 P I\u2032 (\u2203P can be seen as a special case where\nH = >).\nFirst, we prove that I \u2032 is a classical model of KB. In particular, it suffices to show that classical inclusions are satisfied in \u2206I\n\u2032 \\ \u2206J \u2032 . Given a classical inclusion C1 v D1 of KB, assume that z \u2208 CI\u20321 , and recall that C1 is of the type\nA1 u . . . uAn u \u2203R1 u . . . u \u2203Rm.\nIt suffices to show that there exists an individual w \u2208 \u2206J \u2032 that satisfies C1 as well. By construction, for all \u2203R occurring in C1, z \u2208 supp I(\u2203R), therefore z \u2208 supp I(C1). This means that there exists a witness w \u2208 supp I(C1) in \u2206J . Since for each concept E, w \u2208 EI implies w \u2208 EJ , it follows that w \u2208 supp J (C1). Since the priority relation is empty, for each DI \u03b4 in KD it holds satJ (\u03b4) \u2286 satJ \u2032(\u03b4). As a consequence, for each concept E it holds supp J (E) \u2286 supp J \u2032(E). In\nparticular, w \u2208 supp J \u2032(C1) and hence w \u2208 CJ \u2032 1 and w \u2208 D J \u2032 1 . By construction, we obtain that z \u2208 DI\u20321 . It remains to prove that I \u2032 improves I according to <fix. Let \u03b4 = (C1 vn D1) be a defeasible inclusion in KB. Since J \u2032 <fix J , it suffices to prove that for all z \u2208 \u2206I \u2032 \\ \u2206J \u2032 , if z \u2208 satI(\u03b4) then z \u2208 satI\u2032(\u03b4). Suppose first that z vacuously satisfies \u03b4 in I (i.e., it violates C1). Atomic concepts have the same extension in I and I \u2032, and z satisfies an unqualified existential in I \u2032 only if it satisfies the same existential in I. Hence, z vacuously satisfies \u03b4 in I \u2032 as well.\nSuppose instead that z actively satisfies \u03b4 in I. If z 6\u2208 supp I(C1), then z 6\u2208 CI \u2032\n1 , and so z vacuously satisfies \u03b4 in I \u2032. Otherwise, z \u2208 supp I(C1) and z \u2208 supp I(D1). By construction, there is a witness w \u2208 \u2206J \u2032 such that w \u2208 supp J (D1) \u2286 supp J \u2032(D1). This implies that w \u2208 DJ \u2032\n1 and, considering the construction of P I\n\u2032 , z \u2208 DJ \u20321 . Therefore, z \u2208 satJ \u2032(\u03b4) and we obtain the thesis. 2"}], "references": [{"title": "The instance problem and the most specific concept in the description logic EL w.r.t. terminological cycles with descriptive semantics", "author": ["F.

Nonmonotonic description logics have been studied for many years, however no practical such knowledge representation languages exist, due to a combination of semantic difficulties and high computational complexity. Independently, low-complexity description logics such as DL-lite and EL have been introduced and incorporated in the OWL standard. Therefore, it is interesting to see whether the syntactic restrictions characterizing DL-lite and EL bring computational benefits to their nonmonotonic versions, too. In this paper we extensively investigate the computational complexity of Circumscription when knowledge bases are formulated in DL-liteR, EL, and fragments thereof. We identify fragments whose complexity ranges from P to the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, as well as fragments whose complexity raises to PSPACE and beyond.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
