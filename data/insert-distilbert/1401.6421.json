Probabilistic Modeling of Ranking Data: Three Challenges", "text": "Rankings arise in a number of machine learning application settings such as preference analysis for movies and books (Lebanon & Mao, 2008) and political election analysis (Gormley & Murphy, 2007; Huang & Guestrin, 2010). In many of these problems, it is of great interest to build statistical models over ranking data in order to make predictions, form recommendations, discover latent trends and structure and to construct human-comprehensible data summaries.\nc\u00a92012 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.\nModeling distributions over rankings is a difficult problem, however, due to the fact that as the number of items being ranked increases, the number of possible rankings increases factorially. This combinatorial explosion forces us to confront three central challenges when dealing with rankings. First, we need to deal with storage complexity \u2014 how can we compactly represent a distribution over the space of rankings?1 Then there is algorithmic complexity \u2014 how can we efficiently answer probabilistic inference queries given a distribution?\nFinally, we must contend with what we refer to as human task complexity, which is a challenge stemming from the fact that it can be difficult to accurately elicit a full ranking over a large list of candidates from a human user; choosing from a list of n! options is no easy task and users typically prefer to provide partial information. Take the American Psychological Association (APA) elections, for example, which allow their voters to rank order candidates from favorite to least favorite. In the 1980 election, there were five candidates, and therefore 5! = 120 ways to rank those five candidates. Despite the small candidate list, most voters in the election preferred to only specify their top-k favorite candidates rather than writing down full rankings on their ballots (see Figure 1). For example, roughly a third of voters simply wrote down their single favorite candidate in this 1980 election.\nThese three intertwined challenges of storage, algorithmic, and human task complexity are the central issues of probabilistic modeling for rankings, and models that do not efficiently handle all three sources of complexity have limited applicability. In this paper, we examine a flexible and intuitive class of models for rankings based on a generalization of probabilistic independence called riffled independence, proposed in our recent work (Huang & Guestrin, 2009, 2010). While our previous papers have focused primarily on representational (storage complexity) issues, we now concentrate on inference and incomplete observations (i.e., partial rankings), showing that in addition to storage complexity, riffle independence based models can efficiently address issues of algorithmic and human task complexity.\nIn fact the two issues of algorithmic and human task complexity are intricately linked for riffle independent models. By considering partial rankings, we give users more flexibility to provide as much or as little information as they care to give. In the context of partial ranking data, the most relevant inference queries also take the form of partial rankings. For example, we might want to predict a voter\u2019s second choice candidate given information about his first choice. One of our main contributions in this paper is to show that inference for such partial ranking queries can be performed particularly efficiently for riffle independent models.\nThe main contributions of our work are as follows:2\n\u2022 We reveal a natural and fundamental connection between riffle independent models and partial rankings. In particular, we show that the collection of partial rankings over an item set form a complete characterization of the space of observations upon\n1. Note that it is common to wonder why one would care to represent a distribution over all rankings if the number of sample rankings is never nearly as large. This problem that the number of samples is always much smaller than n! however, means that most rankings are never observed, limiting our ability to estimate the probability of an arbitrary ranking. The only way to overcome the paucity of samples is to exploit representational structure, which is very much in alignment with solving the storage complexity issue. 2. This paper is an extended presentation of our paper (Huang, Kapoor, & Guestrin, 2011) which appeared in the 2011 Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI) as well as results from the first author\u2019s dissertation (Huang, 2011).\nwhich one can efficiently condition a riffle independent model. As a result, we show that when ranked items satisfy the riffled independence relationship, conditioning on partial rankings can be done efficiently, with running time O(n\u00b7|H|), where |H| denotes the number of model parameters. \u2022 We prove that, in a sense (which we formalize), it is impossible to efficiently condition\nriffle independent models on observations that do not take the form of partial rankings. \u2022 We propose the first algorithm that is capable of efficiently estimating the structure\nand parameters of riffle independent models from heterogeneous collections of partially ranked data. \u2022 We show results on real voting and preference data evidencing the effectiveness of our\nmethods."}, {"heading": "2. Riffled Independence For Rankings", "text": "A ranking, \u03c3, of items in an item set \u2126 is a one-to-one mapping between \u2126 and a rank set R = {1, . . . , n} and is denoted using vertical bar notation as \u03c3\u22121(1)|\u03c3\u22121(2)| . . . |\u03c3\u22121(n). We say that \u03c3 ranks item i1 before (or over) item i2 if the rank of i1 is less than the rank of i2. For example, \u2126 might be {Corn, Peas,Apples,Oranges} and the ranking Corn|Peas|Apples|Oranges encodes a preference of Corn over Peas which is in turn preferred over Apples and so on. The collection of all possible rankings of item set \u2126 is denoted by S\u2126 (or just Sn when \u2126 is implicit).\nSince there are n! rankings of n items, it is intractable to estimate or even explicitly represent arbitrary distributions on Sn without making structural assumptions about the underlying distribution. While there are many possible simplifying assumptions that one can make, we focus on an approach that we have proposed in recent papers (Huang & Guestrin, 2009, 2010) in which the ranks of items are assumed to satisfy an intuitive generalized notion of probabilistic independence known as riffled independence. In this paper, we argue that riffled independence assumptions are particularly effective in settings where one would like to make queries taking the form of partial rankings. In the remainder of this section, we review riffled independence.\nThe riffled independence assumption posits that rankings over the item set \u2126 are generated by independently generating rankings of smaller disjoint item subsets (say, A and B) which partition \u2126, and piecing together a full ranking by interleaving (or riffle shuffling) these smaller rankings together. For example, to rank our item set of foods, one might first rank the vegetables and fruits separately, then interleave the two subset rankings to form a full ranking. To formally define riffled independence, we use the notions of relative rankings and interleavings.\nDefinition 1 (Relative ranking map). Given a ranking \u03c3 \u2208 S\u2126 and any subset A \u2282 \u2126, the relative ranking of items in A, \u03c6A(\u03c3), is a ranking, \u03c0 \u2208 SA, such that \u03c0(i) < \u03c0(j) if and only if \u03c3(i) < \u03c3(j).\nDefinition 2 (Interleaving map). Given a ranking \u03c3 \u2208 S\u2126 and a partition of \u2126 into disjoint sets A and B, the interleaving of A and B in \u03c3 (denoted, \u03c4AB(\u03c3)) is a (binary) mapping from the rank set R = {1, . . . , n} to {A,B} indicating whether a rank in \u03c3 is occupied by A or B. As with rankings, we denote the interleaving of a ranking by its vertical bar notation: [\u03c4AB(\u03c3)](1)|[\u03c4AB(\u03c3)](2)| . . . |[\u03c4AB(\u03c3)](n).\nExample 3. Consider a partitioning of an item set \u2126 into vegetables A = {Corn, Peas} and fruits B = {Apples,Oranges}, as well as a full ranking over these four items: \u03c3 = Corn|Oranges|Peas|Apples. In this case, the relative ranking of vegetables in \u03c3 is \u03c6A(\u03c3) = Corn|Peas and the relative ranking of fruits in \u03c3 is \u03c6B(\u03c3) = Oranges|Apples. The interleaving of vegetables and fruits in \u03c3 is \u03c4AB(\u03c3) = A|B|A|B.\nDefinition 4 (Riffled Independence). Let h be a distribution over S\u2126 and consider a subset of items A \u2282 \u2126 and its complement B. The sets A and B are said to be riffle independent if h decomposes (or factors) as:\nh(\u03c3) = mAB(\u03c4AB(\u03c3)) \u00b7 fA(\u03c6A(\u03c3)) \u00b7 gB(\u03c6B(\u03c3)),\nfor distributions mAB, fA and gB, defined over interleavings and relative rankings of A and B respectively. In other words, A and B are riffle independent if the relative rankings of A and B, as well as their interleaving are mutually independent. We refer to mAB as the interleaving distribution and fA and gB as the relative ranking distributions.\nRiffled independence has been found to approximately hold in a number of real datasets (Huang & Guestrin, 2012). When such relationships can be identified in data, then instead of exhaustively representing all n! ranking probabilities, one can represent just the factors mAB, fA and gB, which are distributions over smaller sets."}, {"heading": "2.1 Hierarchical Riffle Independent Models", "text": "The relative ranking factors fA and gB are themselves distributions over rankings. To further reduce the parameter space, it is natural to consider hierarchical decompositions of item sets into nested collections of partitions (like hierarchical clustering). For example, Figure 2.1 shows a hierarchical decomposition where vegetables are riffle independent of fruits among the \u201chealthy\u201d foods, and these healthy foods are, in turn, riffle independent of the subset of desserts: {Doughnuts,M&Ms}.\nFor simplicity, we restrict consideration to binary hierarchies, defined as tuples of the form H = (HA, HB), where HA and HB are either (1) null, in which case H is called a leaf, or (2) hierarchies over item sets A and B respectively. In this second case, A and B are assumed to form a nontrivial partitioning of the item set.\nDefinition 5. We say that a distribution h factors riffle independently with respect to a hierarchy H = (HA, HB) if item sets A and B are riffle independent with respect to h, and both fA and gB factor riffle independently with respect to subhierarchies HA and HB, respectively.\nLike Bayesian networks, these hierarchies represent families of distributions obeying a certain set of (riffled) independence constraints and can be parameterized locally. To draw from such a model, one generates full rankings recursively starting by drawing rankings of the leaf sets, then working up the tree, sequentially interleaving rankings until reaching the root. The parameters of these hierarchical models are simply the interleaving and relative ranking distributions at the internal nodes and leaves of the hierarchy, respectively.\nIn general, the number of total parameters required to represent a hierarchical riffle independent model can (as with Bayesian networks) still scale exponentially in the number of items. For example, the number of interleavings of p items with n \u2212 p items is ( n p ) . It is often the case however, that much fewer parameters are necessary. For example, thin models (Huang & Guestrin, 2012), in which the number of items factored out of the model at each stage of the hierarchy is never more than a small constant k, can always be represented with a (degree k) polynomial number of parameters. We will use |H| to refer to the number of parameters necessary for representing a distribution which factors according to hierarchy H.\nBy decomposing distributions over rankings into small pieces (like Bayesian networks have done for other distributions), these hierarchical models allow for better interpretability, efficient probabilistic representation, low sample complexity, efficient MAP optimization, and, as we show in this paper, efficient inference.\nExample 6. In Figure 3(a), we reproduce the hierarchical structure that was learned using a fully ranked subset of the APA data consisting of 5000 training examples in Huang and Guestrin (2012). There were five candidates in the election: (1) William Bevan, (2) Ira Iscoe, (3) Charles Kiesler, (4) Max Siegle, and (5) Logan Wright (Marden, 1995). Strikingly, the structure that is learned using an algorithm (maximum likelihood) which knows nothing about the underlying politics of the APA, has leaf nodes which correspond exactly to the political coalitions that dominated the APA in the 1980 election \u2014 the research psychologists\n(candidates 1 and 3), the clinical psychologists (candidates 4 and 5), and the community psychologists (candidate 2).\nIn Figure 3(b), we plot the corresponding parameter distributions that are learned via maximum likelihood. There are three relative ranking distributions, each corresponding to a political party, as well as two interleaving distributions (one for the interleaving of research and clinical psychologists, and one for the interleaving of the community psychologist and all remaining candidates). Since each parameter distribution is constrained to sum to 1, there are a total of 11 free parameters."}, {"heading": "2.2 Model Estimation", "text": "In this paper we estimate riffle independent models based on the methods introduced in our earlier work. Given the hierarchial structure of a model, the maximum likelihood parameter estimates of a hierarchical riffle independent model are straightforward to compute via frequency estimates. But how to estimate the correct structure of a model is a more challenging problem. The key insight lies in noticing that if two subsets A and B are riffle independent, then for any i \u2208 A and j, k \u2208 B, the independence relation \u03c3(i) \u22a5 (\u03c3(j) < \u03c3(k)) must hold. Our structure learning algorithms operate by hunting for these \u2018tripletwise\u2019 independence relations within the data. We defer interested readers to the details in (Huang & Guestrin, 2012).\nNote that in our earlier work, we assumed that our algorithms have access to a dataset consisting of i.i.d. full rankings provided by users. In the current work, we will relax our assumptions by allowing for users to provide partially ranked data. One assumption throughout, however, is that each user has a full ranking in mind over the items. In particular, our current work does not address the incomplete ranking problem, in which users might not have seen all of the items (we discuss possible extensions to the incomplete ranking setting in Section 9."}, {"heading": "3. Decomposable Observations", "text": "Given a prior distribution, h, over rankings and an observation O, Bayes rule tells us that the posterior distribution, h(\u03c3|O), is proportional to L(O|\u03c3) \u00b7 h(\u03c3), where L(O|\u03c3) is the likelihood function. This operation of conditioning h on an observation O is typically computationally intractable since it requires multiplying two n! dimensional functions, unless one can exploit structural decompositions of the problem. In this section, we describe a decomposition for a certain class of likelihood functions over the space of rankings in which the observations are \u2018factored\u2019 into simpler parts. When an observation O is decomposable in this way, we show that one can efficiently condition a riffle independent prior distribution on O. For simplicity in this paper, we focus primarily on subset observations whose likelihood functions encode membership with some subset of rankings in Sn.\nDefinition 7 (Subset observations). A subset observation O is a binary observation whose likelihood is proportional to the indicator function of some subset of Sn \u2014 i.e.,\nL(O|\u03c3) = {\n1 if \u03c3 \u2208 O 0 otherwise .\nAs a running example, we will consider the class of first place observations throughout the chapter (we will consider far more general observation models in later sections). The first place observation O =\u201cCorn is ranked first\u201d, for example, is associated with the collection of rankings placing the item Corn in first place (O = {\u03c3 : \u03c3(Corn) = 1}). We are interested in computing the posterior h(\u03c3|\u03c3 \u2208 O). Thus in the first place scenario, we are given a voter\u2019s top choice and we would like to infer his preferences over the remaining candidates.\nGiven a partitioning of the item set \u2126 into two subsets A and B, it is sometimes possible to decompose (or factor) a subset observation involving items in \u2126 into smaller subset observations involving A, B and the interleavings of A and B independently. Such decompositions can often be exploited for efficient inference.\nExample 8.\n\u2022 Consider the first place observation\nO = \u201cCorn is ranked first\u201d,\nwhich can be decomposed into two independent observations \u2014 an observation on the relative ranking of Vegetables, and an observation on the interleaving of Vegetables and Fruits:\n\u2013 OA = \u201cCorn is ranked first among Vegetables\u201d, \u2013 OA,B = \u201cFirst place is occupied by a Vegetable\u201d.\nTo condition on O in this case, one updates the relative ranking distribution over Vegetables (A) by zeroing out rankings of vegetables which do not place Corn in first place, and updates the interleaving distribution by zeroing out interleavings which do not place a Vegetable in first place, then normalizes the resulting distributions. \u2022 An example of a nondecomposable observation is the observation\nO = \u201cCorn is in third place\u201d.\nTo see that O does not decompose (with respect to Vegetables and Fruits), it is enough to notice that the interleaving of Vegetables and Fruits is not independent of the relative ranking of Vegetables. If, for example, an element \u03c3 \u2208 O interleaves A (Vegetables) and B (Fruits) as \u03c4AB(\u03c3) = A|B|A|B, then since \u03c3(Corn) = 3, the relative ranking of Vegetables is constrained to be \u03c6A(\u03c3) = Peas|Corn. Since the interleavings and relative rankings are not independent, we see that O cannot be decomposable.\nFormally, we use riffle independent factorizations to define decomposability with respect to a hierarchy H of the item set.\nDefinition 9 (Decomposability). Given a hierarchy H over the item set, a subset observation O decomposes with respect to H if its likelihood function L(O|\u03c3) factors riffle independently with respect to H.\nWhen subset observations and the prior decompose according to the same hierarchy, we can show (as in Example 8) that the posterior also decomposes.\nProposition 10. Let H be a hierarchy over the item set. Given a prior distribution h and a subset observation O which both decompose with respect to H, the posterior distribution h(\u03c3|O) also factors riffle independently with respect to H.\nProof. Denote the likelihood function corresponding to O by L (in this proof, it does not matter that O is assumed to be a subset observation \u2014 the result holds for arbitrary likelihoods).\nWe use induction on the size of the item set n = |\u2126|. The base case n = 1 is trivially true. Next consider the general case where n > 1. The posterior distribution, by Bayes rule, can be written h(\u03c3|O) \u221d L(\u03c3) \u00b7 h(\u03c3). There are now two cases. If H is a leaf node, then the posterior h\u2032 trivially factors according to H, and we are done. Otherwise, L and h both factor, by assumption, according to H = (HA, HB) in the following way:\nL(\u03c3) = mL(\u03c4AB(\u03c3)) \u00b7fL(\u03c6A(\u03c3)) \u00b7gL(\u03c6B(\u03c3)), and h(\u03c3) = mh(\u03c4AB(\u03c3)) \u00b7fh(\u03c6A(\u03c3)) \u00b7gh(\u03c6B(\u03c3)).\nMultiplying and grouping terms, we see that the posterior factors as:\nh(\u03c3|O) = [mL \u00b7mh](\u03c4AB(\u03c3)) \u00b7 [fL \u00b7 fh](\u03c6A(\u03c3)) \u00b7 [gL \u00b7 gh](\u03c6B(\u03c3)).\nTo show that h(\u03c3|O) factors with respect to H, we need to demonstrate (by Definition 5) that the distributions [fL \u00b7fh] and [gL \u00b7gh] (after normalizing) factor with respect to HA and\nHB, respectively. Since fL and fh both factor according to the hierarchy HA by assumption and |A| < n since H is not a leaf, we can invoke the inductive hypothesis to show that the posterior distribution, which is proportional to fL \u00b7 fh must also factor according to HA. Similarly, the distribution proportional to gL \u00b7 gh must factor according to HB."}, {"heading": "4. Complete Decomposability", "text": "The condition of Proposition 10, that the prior and observation must decompose with respect to exactly the same hierarchy, is a sufficient one for efficient inference, but it might at first glance seem so restrictive as to render the proposition useless in practice. To overcome this limitation of \u201chierarchy specific\u201d decomposability, we explore a special family of observations (which we call completely decomposable) for which the property of decomposability does not depend specifically on a particular hierarchy, implying in particular that for these observations, efficient inference is always possible (provided that efficient representation of the prior distribution is also possible).\nTo illustrate how an observation can decompose with respect to multiple hierarchies over the item set, consider again the first place observation O =\u201cCorn is ranked first\u201d. We argued in Example 8 that O is a decomposable observation. Notice however that decomposability for this particular observation does not depend on how the items are partitioned by the hierarchy. Specifically, if instead of Vegetables and Fruits, the sets A = {Corn,Apples} and B = {Peas,Oranges} are riffle independent, a similar decomposition of O would continue to hold, with O decomposing as an observation on the relative ranking of items in A (\u201cCorn is first among items in A\u201d), and an observation on the interleaving of A and B (\u201cFirst place is occupied by some element of A\u201d).\nTo formally capture this notion that an observation can decompose with respect to arbitrary underlying hierarchies, we define complete decomposability :\nDefinition 11 (Complete decomposability). We say that a subset observation O is completely decomposable if it decomposes with respect to every possible hierarchy over the item set \u2126. We denote the collection of all possible completely decomposable (subset) observations as C. See Figure 4 for an illustration of the set C.\nConceptually, completely decomposable observations correspond to indicator functions that are \u201cas riffle independent as possible\u201d. Complete decomposability is a guarantee for an observation O that one can always exploit any available factorized structure of the prior distribution in order to efficiently condition on O.\nProposition 12. Let H be any binary hierarchy over the item set. Given a prior h which factorizes with respect to H, and a completely decomposable observation O, the posterior h(\u03c3|O) also decomposes with respect to H.\nProof. Proposition 12 follows as a simple corollary to Proposition 10.\nExample 13. The simplest example of a completely decomposable observation is the uniform observation Ounif = S\u2126, which includes all possible rankings and corresponds to a uniform indicator function \u03b4unif over rankings. Given any hierarchy H, \u03b4unif can be shown to decompose riffle independently with respect to H, where each factor is also uniform, and hence Ounif is completely decomposable.\nThe uniform observation is of course not particularly interesting in the context of Bayesian inference, but on the other hand, given the stringent conditions in Definition 11, it is not obvious that nontrivial completely decomposable observations can even exist. Nonetheless, there do exist nontrivial examples (such as the first place observations), and in the next section, we exhibit a rich and general class of completely decomposable observations."}, {"heading": "5. Complete Decomposability of Partial Ranking Observations", "text": "In this section we discuss the mathematical problem of fully characterizing the class of completely decomposable observations. Our main contribution in this section is to show that completely decomposable observations correspond precisely to partial rankings of the item set.\nPartial rankings. We begin our discussion by introducing partial rankings, which allow for items to be tied with respect to a ranking \u03c3 by \u2018dropping\u2019 verticals from the vertical bar representation of \u03c3.\nDefinition 14 (Partial ranking observation). Let \u21261, \u21262,. . . , \u2126r be an ordered collection of subsets which partition \u2126 (i.e., \u222ai\u2126i = \u2126 and \u2126i \u2229 \u2126j = \u2205 if i 6= j). The partial ranking observation3 corresponding to this partition is the collection of rankings which rank items\n3. As remarked by Ailon (2007), we note that \u201cThe term partial ranking used here should not be confused with two other standard objects: (1) Partial order, namely, a reflexive, transitive anti-symmetric binary\nin \u2126i before items in \u2126j if i < j. We denote this partial ranking as \u21261|\u21262| . . . |\u2126r and say that it has type \u03b3 = (|\u21261|, |\u21262|, . . . , |\u2126r|). We denote the collection of all partial rankings (over n items) as P.\nEach partial ranking as defined above can be viewed as a coset of the subgroup S\u03b3 = S\u03b31 \u00d7 S\u03b32 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 S\u03b3r . Given the type \u03b3 and any full ranking \u03c0 \u2208 S\u2126, there is only one partial ranking of type \u03b3 containing \u03c0, thus we will therefore equivalently denote the partial ranking \u21261|\u21262| . . . |\u2126r as S\u03b3\u03c0, where \u03c0 is any element of \u21261|\u21262| . . . |\u2126r. Note that this coset notation allows for multiple rankings \u03c3 to refer to the same partial ranking S\u03b3\u03c3.\nThe space of partial rankings as defined above captures a rich and natural class of observations. In particular, partial rankings encompass a number of commonly occurring special cases, which have traditionally been modeled in isolation, but in our work (as well as recent works such as Lebanon & Lafferty, 2003; Lebanon & Mao, 2008) can be used in a unified setting.\nExample 15. Partial ranking observations include:\n\u2022 (First place, or Top-1 observations): First place observations correspond to partial rankings of type \u03b3 = (1, n \u2212 1). The observation that \u201cCorn is ranked first\u201d can be written as Corn|Peas,Apples,Oranges. \u2022 (Top-k observations): Top-k observations are partial rankings with type \u03b3 = (1, . . . , 1, n\u2212 k). These generalize the first place observations by specifying the items mapping to the first k ranks, leaving all n\u2212 k remaining items implicitly ranked behind. For example, the observation that \u201cCorn is ranked first and Peas is ranked second\u201d can be written as Corn|Peas|Apples,Oranges. \u2022 (Desired/less desired dichotomy): Partial rankings of type \u03b3 = (k, n\u2212k) correspond to a subset of k items being preferred or desired over the remaining subset of n\u2212k items. For example, partial rankings of type (k, n\u2212k) might arise in approval voting in which voters mark the subset of \u201capproved\u201d candidates, implicitly indicating disapproval of the remaining n\u2212 k candidates. \u2022 (Ratings): Finally, partial rankings can come in the form of rating data where, for example, restaurants are rated as, ?, ??, or ? ? ?. A corresponding partial ranking would thus \u201ctie\u201d restaurants that are rated with the same number of stars, while ranking restaurants with more stars above restaurants with fewer stars. \u2022 (Trivial observations): Partial rankings of type \u03b3 = (n) refer to trivial observations whose likelihood functions are uniform on the entire space of rankings, S\u2126. The trivial observation for rankings of the item set \u2126 = {Corn, Peas,Apples}, for example, can simply be written simply as Corn, Peas,Apples.\nTo show how partial ranking observations decompose, we will exhibit an explicit factorization with respect to a hierarchy H over items. For simplicity, we begin by considering the single layer case, in which the items are partitioned into two leaf sets A and B. Our factorization depends on the following notions of consistency of relative rankings and interleavings with a partial ranking.\nrelation; and (2) A ranking of a subset of \u2126 [which we discuss in Section 9 as incomplete rankings]. In search engines, for example, although only the top-k elements of \u2126 are returned, the remaining n \u2212 k are implicitly assumed to be ranked behind [and therefore, search engines return partial rankings].\u201d\nDefinition 16 (Restriction consistency). Given a partial ranking S\u03b3\u03c0 = \u21261|\u21262| . . . |\u2126r and any subset A \u2282 \u2126, we define the restriction of S\u03b3\u03c0 to A as the partial ranking on items in A obtained by intersecting each \u2126i with A. Hence the restriction of S\u03b3\u03c0 to A is:\n[S\u03b3\u03c0]A = \u21261 \u2229A|\u21262 \u2229A| . . . |\u2126r \u2229A.\nGiven a ranking, \u03c3A of items in A, we say that \u03c3A is consistent with the partial ranking S\u03b3\u03c0 if \u03c3A is a member of the restriction of S\u03b3\u03c0 to A, [S\u03b3\u03c0]A.\nDefinition 17 (Interleaving consistency). Given an interleaving \u03c4AB of two sets A,B which partition \u2126, we say that \u03c4AB is consistent with a partial ranking S\u03b3\u03c0 = \u21261| . . . |\u2126r (with type \u03b3) if the first \u03b31 entries of \u03c4AB contain the same number of As and Bs as \u21261, and the second \u03b32 entries of \u03c4AB contain the same number of As and Bs as \u21262, and so on. Given a partial ranking S\u03b3\u03c0, we denote the collection of consistent interleavings as [S\u03b3\u03c0]AB.\nFor example, consider the partial ranking\nS\u03b3\u03c0 = Corn,Apples|Peas,Oranges,\nwhich places a single vegetable and a single fruit in the first two ranks, and a single vegetable and a single fruit in the last two ranks. Alternatively, S\u03b3\u03c0 partially specifies an interleaving AB|AB. The full interleavings A|B|B|A and B|A|B|A are consistent with S\u03b3\u03c0 (by dropping vertical lines) while A|A|B|B is not consistent (since it places two vegetables in the first two ranks).\nUsing the notions of consistency with a partial ranking, we show that partial ranking observations are decomposable with respect to any binary partitioning (i.e., single layer hierarchy) of the item set.\nProposition 18 (Single layer hierarchy). For any partial ranking observation S\u03b3\u03c0 and any binary partitioning of the item set (A,B), the indicator function of S\u03b3\u03c0, \u03b4S\u03b3\u03c0, factors riffle independently as:\n\u03b4S\u03b3\u03c0(\u03c3) = mAB(\u03c4AB(\u03c3)) \u00b7 fA(\u03c6A(\u03c3)) \u00b7 gB(\u03c6B(\u03c3)), (5.1)\nwhere the factors mAB, fA and gB are the indicator functions for consistent interleavings and relative rankings, [S\u03b3\u03c0]AB, [S\u03b3\u03c0]A and [S\u03b3\u03c0]B, respectively.\nThe single layer decomposition of Proposition 18 can be turned into a recursive decomposition for partial ranking observations over arbitrary binary hierarchies, which establishes our main result. In particular, given a partial ranking S\u03b3\u03c0 and a prior distribution which factorizes according to a hierarchy H, we first condition the topmost interleaving distribution by zeroing out all parameters corresponding to interleavings which are not consistent with S\u03b3\u03c0, and normalizing the distribution. We then need to condition the subhierarchies HA and HB on relative rankings of A and B which are consistent with S\u03b3\u03c0, respectively. Since these consistent sets, [S\u03b3\u03c0]A and [S\u03b3\u03c0]B, are partial rankings themselves, the same algorithm for conditioning on a partial ranking can be applied recursively to each of the subhierarchies HA and HB. To be precise, we show that:\nTheorem 19. Every partial ranking is completely decomposable (P \u2282 C).\nprcondition (Prior hprior, Hierarchy H, Observation S\u03b3\u03c0 = \u21261|\u21262| . . . |\u2126r) if isLeaf(H) then\nforall \u03c3 do hpost(\u03c3)\u2190 { hprior(\u03c3) if \u03c3 \u2208 S\u03b3\u03c0\n0 otherwise ;\nNormalize (hpost) ; return (hpost);\nelse forall \u03c4 do\nmpost(\u03c4)\u2190 { mprior(\u03c4) if \u03c4 \u2208 [S\u03b3\u03c0]AB\n0 otherwise ;\nNormalize (mpost) ; f(\u03c6A)\u2190prcondition (fprior, HA, [S\u03b3\u03c0]A) ; g(\u03c6B)\u2190prcondition (gprior, HB , [S\u03b3\u03c0]B) ; return (mpost, fpost, gpost);\nAlgorithm 1: Pseudocode for prcondition, an algorithm for recursively conditioning a hierarchical riffle independent prior distribution on partial ranking observations. See Definitions 16 and 17 for [S\u03b3\u03c3]A, [S\u03b3\u03c3]B , and [S\u03b3\u03c3]AB . The runtime of prcondition is O(n \u00b7 |H|), where |H| is the number of model parameters. Input: All parameter distributions of the prior hprior represented in explicit tabular form, and an observation S\u03b3\u03c0 in the form of a partial ranking. Output: All parameter distributions of the posterior hpost represented in explicit tabular form.\nSince the proof of Theorem 19 is fairly straight forward given the form of the factorization (Equation 5.1), it is deferred to the Appendix. As a consequence of Theorem 19 and Proposition 12, conditioning on partial ranking observations can be performed efficiently. See Algorithm 1 for details on our recursive conditioning algorithm.\nWhat is the running time complexity of conditioning on a partial ranking? The recursion of Algorithm 1 operates on each parameter distribution once, setting the probabilities of the interleavings or relative rankings in each such distribution to either zero or not, then normalizing. To decide whether to zero out a probability or not, one must check a partial ranking for consistency against either an interleaving or relative ranking, which requires at most O(n) time. Therefore, in total, Algorithm 1 requires O(n \u00b7 |H|) time, where |H| is the total number of model parameters. Notice that the complexity of conditioning depends linearly on the complexity of the prior \u2014 whenever the prior distribution can be compactly represented, efficient inference for partial ranking observations is also possible. As we have stated in Section 2, |H| can in general scale exponentially in n, but for thin chain models, in which the number of items factored out of the model at each stage is never more than a small constant k, verifying interleaving or relative ranking consistency can be performed in constant time, implying that the conditioning operation is linear in the number of model parameters, and guaranteed to be polynomial in n.\nExample 20. In this example, we consider conditioning the APA distribution from Example 6 on the observation O that \u201cCandidate 3 is ranked in first place,\u201d which can also be represented as the partial ranking O = 3|1, 2, 4, 5. Recall that candidate 3 was Charles Kiesler, who was a research psychologist.\nIn Figure 5(a) we show again the structure and parameters of the prior distribution for the APA election data, highlighting in particular the interleavings and relative rankings which\nare consistent with O. For example, of the possible interleavings of research psychologists (D) with clinical psychologists (E), the interleavings that are consistent with O are those which rank a research psychologist first among the research and clinical psychologists. There are therefore only three consistent interleavings: D|D|E|E, D|E|D|E, and D|E|E|D.\nConditioning on O sets all relative rankings and interleavings which are not consistent with O to zero and normalizes each resulting parameter distribution. The resulting riffle independent representation of the posterior distribution is shown in Figure 5(b)."}, {"heading": "5.1 An Impossibility Result", "text": "It is interesting to consider what completely decomposable observations exist beyond partial rankings. One of our main contributions is to show that there are no such observations.\nTheorem 21 (Converse of Theorem 19). Every completely decomposable observation takes the form of a partial ranking (C \u2282 P).\nTogether, Theorems 19 and 21 form a significant insight into the nature of rankings, showing that the notions of partial rankings and riffled independence are deeply connected. In fact, our result shows that it is even possible to define partial rankings via complete decomposability!\nAs a practical matter, Theorem 21 shows that there is no algorithm based on simple multiplicative updates to the parameters which can exactly condition on observations which do not take the form of partial rankings. The computational complexity of conditioning on observations which are not partial rankings remains open. We conjecture that approximate inference approaches may be necessary for efficiently handling more complex observations."}, {"heading": "5.2 Proof of the Impossiblity Result (Theorem 21)", "text": "We now turn to proving Theorem 21. Since this proof is significantly longer and less obvious than the proof for its converse (Theorem 19), we sketch the main ideas that drive the proof here and refer interested readers to details in the Appendix.\nRecall that the definition of the linear span of a set of vectors in a vector space is the intersection of all linear subspaces containing that set of vectors. To prove Theorem 21, we introduce analogous concepts of the span of a set of rankings.\nDefinition 22 (rspan and pspan). Let X \u2282 Sn be any collection of rankings. We define pspan(X) to be the intersection of all partial rankings containing X. Similarly, we define rspan(X) to be the intersection of all completely decomposable observations containing X. More formally,\npspan(X) = \u22c2\nS\u03b3\u03c3:X\u2282S\u03b3\u03c3 S\u03b3\u03c3, and rspan(X) = \u22c2 O:X\u2282O, O\u2208C O.\nFor example, if X = {Corn|Peas|Apples,Apples|Peas|Corn}, it can be checked that the only partial ranking of all three items containing both items of X is the entire set itself. Thus pspan(X) = Corn, Peas,Apples.\nOur proof strategy is to establish two claims: (1) that the pspan of any set is always a partial ranking, and (2) that in fact, the rspan and pspan of a set X are exactly the same sets. Since claim (1) is a fact about partial rankings and does not involve riffled independence, we defer all related proofs to the Appendix. Thus we have:\nLemma 23. For any X \u2282 Sn, pspan(X) is a partial ranking.\nProof. See Appendix.\nThe following discussion will instead sketch a proof of claim (2). We first show, however, that Theorem 21 must hold if it is indeed true that claims (1) and (2) hold.\nProof. (of Theorem 21): Given some O \u2208 C, we want to show that O \u2208 P. By claim (2), rspan(O) = pspan(O). Since O is an element of C, however, we also have that O = rspan(O), and thus that O = pspan(O). Finally Lemma 23 (claim (2)) guarantees that pspan(O) is a partial ranking, and so we conclude that O \u2208 P.\nWe now proceed to establish the claim that rspan(X) = pspan(X). The following proposition lists several basic properties of the rspan that we will use in several of the proofs. They all follow directly from definition so we do not write out the proofs.\nProposition 24.\nI. (Monotonicity) For any X, X \u2282 rspan(X). II. (Subset preservation) For any X,X \u2032 such that X \u2282 X \u2032, rspan(X) \u2282 rspan(X \u2032). III. (Idempotence) For any X, rspan(rspan(X)) = rspan(X).\nOne inclusion of our proof that rspan(X) = pspan(X) follows directly from the fact that P \u2282 C (Theorem 19):\nformPspan(X) X0 \u2190 X; t\u2190 0; while \u2203S\u03b3\u03c0, S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032 \u2208 Xt which disagree on the relative ordering of items a1, a2 do\nXt \u2190 \u2205 ; foreach S\u03b3\u03c3 \u2208 Xt do\nAdd any partial ranking obtained by deleting a vertical bar from S\u03b3\u03c3 between items a1 and a2 to Xt;\nt\u2190 t+ 1; return (any element of Xt) ;\nAlgorithm 2: Pseudocode for computing pspan(X). formPspan(X) takes a set of partial rankings (or full rankings) X as input and outputs a partial ranking. This algorithm iteratively deletes vertical bars from elements of X until they are in agreement. Note that it is not necessary to keep track of t, but we do so here to ease notation in the proofs. Nor is this algorithm the most direct way of computing pspan(X), but again, it simplifies the proof of our main theorem.\nLemma 25. For any subset of orderings, X, rspan(X) \u2282 pspan(X).\nProof. Fix a subset X \u2282 Sn and let \u03c0 be any element of rspan(X). We would like to show \u03c0 to be an element of pspan(X). Consider any partial ranking S\u03b3\u03c3 \u2208 P which covers X (i.e., \u03c3\u2032 \u2208 S\u03b3\u03c3 for all \u03c3\u2032 \u2208 X). We want to see that \u03c0 \u2208 S\u03b3\u03c3. By Theorem 19, P \u2208 C, and therefore, S\u03b3\u03c3 \u2208 C. Since \u03c0 \u2208 rspan(X), and \u03c3\u2032 \u2208 S\u03b3\u03c3 for all \u03c3\u2032 \u2208 X, we conclude, by definition of rspan, that \u03c0 \u2208 S\u03b3\u03c3. Since this holds for any partial ranking covering X, \u03c0 \u2208 pspan(X).\nWhat remains is the task of establishing the reverse inclusion:\nProposition 26. For any subset of orderings, X, rspan(X) \u2283 pspan(X).\nTo prove Proposition 26, we consider the problem of computing the partial ranking span (pspan) of a given set of rankings X. In Algorithm 2, we show a simple procedure based on iteratively finding rankings in X which disagree on the pairwise ranking of two items, and replacing those rankings by a partial ranking in which a vertical bar between those two elements have been removed. We show that this algorithm provably outputs the correct result.\nProposition 27. Given a set of rankings X as input, Algorithm 2 outputs pspan(X).\nProof. See Appendix.\nAs a final step before being able to prove Proposition 26, we prove the following two technical lemmas which relate the computation of the pspan in Algorithm 2 to riffled independence, and really form the heart of our argument. In particular, for a completely decomposable observation O \u2208 C, Lemma 28 below shows how a ranking contained in O can \u201cforce\u201d other rankings to also be contained in O.\nLemma 28. Let O \u2208 C and suppose there exist \u03c01, \u03c02 \u2208 O which disagree on the relative ranking of items i, j \u2208 \u2126. Then the ranking obtained by swapping the relative ranking of items i, j within any \u03c03 \u2208 O must also be contained in O.\nProof. Let h be the indicator distribution corresponding to the observation O. We will show that swapping the relative ranking of items i, j in \u03c03 will result in a ranking which is assigned nonzero probability by h, thus showing that this new ranking is contained in O.\nLet A = {i, j} and B = \u2126\\A. Since O \u2208 C, h must factor riffle independently according to the partition (A,B). Thus,\nh(\u03c01) = m(\u03c4AB(\u03c01)) \u00b7 f(\u03c6A(\u03c01)) \u00b7 g(\u03c6B(\u03c01)) > 0, and h(\u03c02) = m(\u03c4AB(\u03c02)) \u00b7 f(\u03c6A(\u03c02)) \u00b7 g(\u03c6B(\u03c02)) > 0.\nSince \u03c01 and \u03c02 disagree on the relative ranking of items in A, this factorization implies in particular that both f(\u03c6A = i|j) > 0 and f(\u03c6A = j|i) > 0. Since h(\u03c03) > 0, it must also be that each of m(\u03c4AB(\u03c03)), f(\u03c6A(\u03c03)), and g(\u03c6B(\u03c03)) have positive probability. We can therefore swap the relative ranking of A, \u03c6A, to obtain a new ranking which has positive probability since all of the terms in the decomposition of this new ranking have positive probability.\nLemma 29 below provides conditions under which removing a vertical bar from one of the rankings in X will not change the support of a completely riffle independent distribution. To illustrate with an example, consider a completely decomposable observation O which contains the partial ranking S\u03b3\u03c0 = Corn, Peas|Apples,Oranges as a subset. What Lemma 29 guarantees is that, if, in addition, there exists any element \u03c0\u0303 in O which disagrees with S\u03b3\u03c0 on the relative ordering of, say, Peas and Oranges, then in fact the partial ranking S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\n\u2032 \u2282= Corn, Peas,Apples,Oranges (with the bar removed from S\u03b3\u03c0) must also be a subset of O. Formally,\nLemma 29. Let S\u03b3\u03c0 = \u21261| . . . |\u2126i|\u2126i+1| . . . |\u2126k be a partial ranking on item set \u2126, and S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\n\u2032 = \u21261| . . . |\u2126i \u222a \u2126i+1| . . . |\u2126k, the partial ranking in which the sets \u2126i and \u2126i+1 are merged. Let a1 \u2208 \u222aij=1\u2126j and a2 \u2208 \u222akj=i+1\u2126j. If O is any element of C such that S\u03b3\u03c0 \u2282 O and there additionally exists a ranking \u03c0\u0303 \u2208 O which disagrees with S\u03b3\u03c0 on the relative ordering of a1, a2, then S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032 \u2282 O.\nProof. The key strategy in our proof of Lemma 29 is to argue that large subsets of rankings must be contained in a completely decomposable observation O by decomposing rankings into transpositions and invoking the technical lemma from above (Lemma 28) repeatedly. See the Appendix for details.\nWe now can use Lemma 29 to show that the reverse inclusion of Proposition 26 also holds, establishing that the two sets rspan(X) and pspan(X) are in fact equal and thereby proving the desired result, that C \u2282 P.\nProof. (of Proposition 26) At each iteration t, Algorithm 2 produces a set of partial rankings, Xt. We denote the union of all partial rankings at time t as X\u0303t \u2261 \u22c3 S\u03b3\u03c3\u2208Xt S\u03b3\u03c3. Note that X\u03030 = X and X\u0303T = pspan(X). The idea of our proof will be to show that at each iteration t, the following set inclusion holds: rspan(X\u0303t) \u2282 rspan(X\u0303t\u22121). If indeed this holds, then\nafter the final iteration T , we will have shown that:\npspan(X) = X\u0303T , (Proposition 27)\n\u2282 rspan(X\u0303T ), (Monotonicity, Proposition 24) \u2282 rspan(X\u03030), (since rspan(X\u0303t) \u2282 rspan(X\u0303t\u22121), shown below), \u2282 rspan(X) (X\u03030 = X, see Algorithm 2)\nwhich would prove the Proposition. It remains now to show that rspan(X\u0303t) \u2282 rspan(X\u0303t\u22121). We claim that X\u0303t \u2282 rspan(X\u0303t\u22121). Let \u03c3 \u2208 X\u0303t. If \u03c3 \u2208 X\u0303t\u22121, then since X\u0303t\u22121 \u2282 rspan(X\u0303t\u22121), we have \u03c3 \u2208 rspan(X\u0303t\u22121) and the proof is done. Otherwise, \u03c3 \u2208 X\u0303t\\X\u0303t\u22121. In this second case, we use the fact that at iteration t, the vertical bar between \u2126i and \u2126i+1 was deleted from the partial ranking S\u03b3\u03c0 = \u21261| . . . |\u2126i|\u2126i+1| . . . |\u2126k (which is a subset of X\u0303t\u22121) to form the partial ranking S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\n\u2032 = \u21261| . . . |\u2126i \u222a \u2126i+1| . . . |\u2126k. (which is a subset of X\u0303t). Furthermore, in order for the vertical bar to have been deleted by the algorithm, there must have existed some partial ranking (and therefore some full ranking \u03c9\u2032) that disagreed with S\u03b3\u03c0 on the relative ordering of items a1, a2 on opposite sides of the bar. Since \u03c3 \u2208 X\u0303t\\X\u0303t\u22121 we can assume that \u03c3 \u2208 S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032.\nWe now would like to apply Lemma 29. Note that for any O \u2208 C such that X\u0303t\u22121 \u2282 O, we also have S\u03b3\u03c0 \u2282 O, since S\u03b3\u03c0 \u2282 X\u0303t\u22121. An application of Lemma 29 then shows that S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\n\u2032 \u2282 O and therefore that \u03c3 \u2208 O. We have shown in fact that \u03c3 \u2208 O holds for any observation O \u2208 C such that X\u0303t\u22121 \u2282 O, and therefore taking the intersection of supports over all O \u2208 C, we see that X\u0303t \u2282 rspan(X\u0303t\u22121). Taking the rspan of both sides yields:\nrspan(X\u0303t) \u2282 rspan(rspan(X\u0303t\u22121)), (Subset preservation, Proposition 24) \u2282 rspan(X\u0303t\u22121). (Idempotence, Proposition 24)"}, {"heading": "5.3 Going Beyond Subset Observations", "text": "Though we have stated all of our results so far for subset observations, we now comment on what our theory would look like if we had considered general likelihood functions. In order to avoid confusion, we here refer to a more general class of functions that we call completely decomposable functions, instead of the completely decomposable subset observations of Definition 11.\nDefinition 30. A function h : Sn \u2192 R is called a completely decomposable function if it factors riffle independently with respect to every hierarchy over the item set \u2126. We denote the collection of all possible completely decomposable functions as C\u0303.\nAs we discuss, C and C\u0303 are very nearly the same. It is quite simple to restate Theorem 19 with respect to the general case of completely decomposable functions:\nTheorem. Every partial ranking indicator function is a completely decomposable function.\nUnfortunately, the proof of its converse (Theorem 21) does not easily generalize, and instead can only be used to show that the support ({\u03c3 \u2208 Sn : h(\u03c3) > 0}) of every completely decomposable function is a partial ranking. It is natural, however, to suspect that a full converse does indeed exist \u2014 that every completely decomposable function is proportional to the indicator function of some partial ranking. In fact, this suspected converse only almost holds. We have:\nTheorem. If h is any completely decomposable function supported on a partial ranking S\u03b3\u03c0 = \u21261| . . . |\u2126r where |\u2126i| 6= 2 for all i = 1, . . . , r, then h is proportional to the indicator function on S\u03b3\u03c0.\nProof. See Appendix.\nExample 31. For completely decomposable functions, it is not possible to do away with the assumption that |\u2126i| 6= 2 for all i. As an example, the function defined below as:\nh(\u03c3) =  2/3 if \u03c3 = Corn|Peas|Apples 1/3 if \u03c3 = Peas|Corn|Apples 0 otherwise ,\nis supported on the partial ranking S\u03b3\u03c0 = Corn, Peas|Apples (where |\u21261| = 2), and is not proportional to any indicator function (i.e., it is not uniform on rankings which are not assigned positive probability).\nHowever, it is still possible to show that h is a completely decomposable function. To prove so, it is necessary to establish only three things: that {Corn, Peas} and {Apples} are riffle independent, that {Corn,Apples} and {Peas} are riffle independent, and that {Peas,Apples} and {Corn} are riffle independent. For example, with respect to the partitioning into sets A = {Corn,Apples} and B = {Peas}, we see that\nh(\u03c3) = m(\u03c4AB(\u03c3)) \u00b7 f(\u03c6A(\u03c3)) \u00b7 g(\u03c6B(\u03c3)),\nwhere:\nm(\u03c4AB) =  2/3 if \u03c4AB = A|B|A 1/3 if \u03c4AB = B|A|A 0 if \u03c4AB = A|A|B , f(\u03c3A) = { 1 if \u03c3{AC} = A|C 0 otherwise , g(\u03c3B) = 1.\nTherefore, when |\u2126i| = 2, it is possible to have completely decomposable functions which are not uniform on their supports."}, {"heading": "5.4 Conditioning on Noisy Observations", "text": "We conclude this section with a remark on handling noise in observations. While we have assumed in this paper that observed partial rankings are always consistent with a user\u2019s underlying full ranking, there are situations in which one may wish to model a noisier setting, where the partial rankings may be misreported with some small probability. A natural model that accounts for noise, for example, might be:\nL(O|\u03c3) = { 1\u2212 \u03b5 if \u03c3 \u2208 O \u03b5\n|O|\u22121 otherwise . (5.2)\nIf a prior distribution factorizes with respect to a hierarchy H, then conditioning on the noisy likelihood of Equation 5.2 results in a posterior distribution which can be written as a weighted mixture of the prior distribution and the posterior that would have resulted from conditioning on a noise-free observation. While each component of this posterior distribution factorizes with respect to H, the mixture itself does not factor in general (and should not factor according to our theory). As a result, iteratively conditioning on multiple partial rankings according to the noisy likelihood function above would quickly lead to an unmanageable number of mixture components. We therefore believe that approximate inference methods for conditioning on multiple noisy partial ranking observations is a fruitful area for further research."}, {"heading": "6. Model Estimation from Partially Ranked Data", "text": "In many ranking based applications, datasets are predominantly composed of partial rankings rather than full rankings due to the fact that for humans, partial rankings are typically easier and faster to specify. In addition, many datasets are heterogeneous, containing partial ranking of different types. For example, in the American Psychological Assoication as well as the Irish House of Parliament elections, voters are allowed to specify their top-k candidate choices for any value of k (see Figures 7(a) and 7(b)). In this section we use the efficient inference algorithm proposed in Section 5 for estimating a riffle independent model from partially ranked data. Because estimating a model using partially ranked data is typically considered to be more difficult than estimating one using only full rankings, a common practice (e.g., see Huang & Guestrin, 2010) has been to simply ignore the partial rankings in a dataset. The ability of a method to incorporate all of the available data however, can lead to significantly improved model accuracy as well as wider applicability of that method. In this section, we propose the first efficient method for estimating the structure and parameters of a hierarchical riffle independent model from heterogeneous datasets consisting of arbitrary partial ranking types. Central to our approach is the idea that given someone\u2019s partial preferences, we can use the efficient algorithms developed in the previous section to infer his full preferences and consequently apply previously proposed algorithms which are designed to work with full rankings."}, {"heading": "6.1 Censoring Interpretations of Partial Rankings", "text": "The model estimation problem for full rankings is stated as follows. Given i.i.d. training examples \u03c3(1), . . . , \u03c3(m) (consisting of full rankings) drawn from a hierarchical riffle independent distribution h, recover the structure and parameters of h.\nIn the partial ranking setting, we again assume i.i.d. draws, but that each training example \u03c3(i) undergoes a censoring process producing a partial ranking consistent with \u03c3(i). For example, censoring might only allow for the ranking of the top-k items of \u03c3(i) to be observed. While we allow for arbitrary types of partial rankings to arise via censoring, we make a common assumption that the partial ranking type resulting from censoring \u03c3(i) does not depend on \u03c3(i) itself."}, {"heading": "6.2 Algorithm", "text": "We treat the model estimation from partial rankings problem as a missing data problem. As with many such problems, if we could determine the full ranking corresponding to each observation in the data, then we could apply algorithms which work in the completely observed data setting. Since full rankings are not given, we utilize an Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach in which we use inference to compute a posterior distribution over full rankings given the observed partial ranking. In our case, we then apply the algorithms from Huang and Guestrin (2010, 2012) which were designed to estimate the hierarchical structure of a model and its parameters from a dataset of full rankings.\nGiven an initial model h and a collection of training examples {O(1),O(2), . . . ,O(m)} consisting of partial rankings, our EM-based approach alternates between the following two steps until convergence is achieved.\n\u2022 (E-step): For each observation, O(i) = S\u03b3(i)\u03c0(i), in the training examples, we use inference to compute a posterior distribution over the full ranking \u03c3 that could have generated O(i) via censoring, h(\u03c3|O(i) = S\u03b3(i)\u03c0(i)). Since the observations take the form of partial rankings and are hence completely decomposable, we use the efficient algorithms in Section 5 to perform the E-step. \u2022 (M-step): In the M-step, one maximizes the expected log-likelihood of the training\ndata with respect to the model. When the hierarchical structure of the model has been provided, or is known beforehand, our M-step can be performed using standard methods for optimizing parameters. When the structure is unknown, we use a structural EM approach, which is analogous to methods from the graphical models literature for structure learning from incomplete data (Friedman, 1997, 1998).\nUnfortunately, the (riffled independence) structure learning algorithm of Huang and Guestrin (2010) is unable to directly use the posterior distributions computed from the E-step. Instead, observing that sampling from riffle independent models can be done efficiently and exactly (as opposed to, for example, MCMC methods), we simply sample full rankings from the posterior distributions computed in the E-step and pass these full rankings into the structure learning algorithm of Huang and Guestrin (2010). The number of samples that are necessary, instead of scaling factorially, scales according to the number of samples required to detect riffled independence (which under mild assumptions is polynomial in n, Huang & Guestrin, 2010)."}, {"heading": "7.

The main aims of our work differ from these web scale settings however \u2014 instead of seeking a single \u2018optimal\u2019 ranking with respect to some objective function, we seek an understanding of a large collection of rankings via density estimation. In the following, we outline two major lines of research which have influenced our work."}, {"heading": "7.1 Additive and Multiplicative Decompositions", "text": "Our paper builds in particular upon a thread of recent work on tractable models for permutation data based on function decompositions. Kondor, Howard, and Jebara (2007) and Huang, Guestrin, and Guibas (2008, 2009) considered additive decompositions of a distribution into a weighted sum of Fourier basis functions. These papers show that low-frequency Fourier assumptions can often be effective for coping with the representational complexity of working with distributions over permutations. They show in particular that conditioning prior distributions on the \u2018low frequency\u2019 likelihood functions that often arise in multiobject tracking problems can be performed especially efficiently.\nUnfortunately, low frequency assumptions are not as applicable for distributions defined over rankings, and to address ranking problems specifically, Huang and Guestrin (2009, 2010) introduced the concept of riffled independence as a useful generalization of probabilistic independence for rankings. Using multiplicative decompositions based on riffled independence, we showed that it is possible to learn the hierarchical structure of a model given a fully ranked dataset. While our previous papers on the topic of riffled independence focused more on problems related to efficiently representing distributions, the main focus of our current paper lies in efficient reasoning/inference and tackling human task complexity by considering partial rankings.\nIt is interesting to note that while it is natural and efficient to condition a Fourier based representation on low-frequency observations (involving a very small number of items) such as O =\u201cAlice is in third place\u201d, a multiplicative decomposition based on riffled independence would not be able to efficiently condition on the same observation. On the other hand, multiplicative decompositions allow us to condition on top-k observations efficiently (independently of the size of k), whereas top-k observations would be difficult to handle in a Fourier theoretic setting (except for very small k)."}, {"heading": "7.2 Mallows Models", "text": "Our work also fits into a larger body of research about the well known Mallows distribution over rankings, parameterized by:\nh(\u03c3;\u03c6, \u03c30) \u221d \u03c6\u2212d\u03c4 (\u03c3,\u03c30), (7.1)\nwhere the function d\u03c4 refers to the Kendall\u2019s tau distance metric on rankings. A Mallows distribution (Equation 7.1) can always be shown to be a special case of a hierarchical riffle independent model in which items are sequentially factored out of the model one by one (Huang, 2011) (see Figure 6).\nMallows models (as well as other similar distance based models) have the advantage that they can compactly represent distributions for very large n, and admit conjugate prior distributions (Meila, Phadnis, Patterson, & Bilmes, 2007). Estimating parameters has been a popular problem for statisticians \u2014 recovering the optimal \u03c30 from data is known as the consensus ranking or rank aggregation problem and is known to be NP -hard (Bartholdi, Tovey, & Trick, 1989). Many authors have focused on approximation algorithms instead.\nLike Gaussian distributions, Mallows models tend to lack flexibility, and so Lebanon and Mao (2008) propose a nonparametric model of ranked (and partially ranked) data based on placing weighted Mallows kernels on top of training examples, which, as they show, can\nrealize a far richer class of distributions, and can be learned efficiently. However, they do not address the inference problem, and it is not immediately clear in many Mallows models papers whether one can efficiently perform inference operations like marginalization and conditioning in such models. Riffle independent models, on the other hand, encompass a class of distributions which is both rich as well as interpretable, and additionally, we have identified precise conditions under which efficient conditioning is possible (the conditions being that the observations take the form of partial rankings).\nThere are several recent works to model partial rankings using Mallows based models. Busse, Orbanz, and Buhmann (2007) learned finite mixtures of Mallows models from topk data (also using an EM approach). Lebanon and Mao (2008), as we have mentioned, developed a nonparametric model based on Mallows models which can handle arbitrary types of partial rankings. In both settings, a central problem is to marginalize a Mallows model over all full rankings which are consistent with a particular partial ranking. To do so efficiently, both papers rely on the fact (first shown in Fligner & Verducci, 1986) that this marginalization step can be performed in closed form. This closed form equation of Fligner and Verducci (1986), however, can be seen as a very special case of our setting since Mallows models can always be shown to factor riffle independently according to a chain structure. Specifically, to compute the sum over rankings which are consistent with a partial ranking S\u03b3\u03c3, it is necessary to condition on S\u03b3\u03c3, and to compute the normalization constant of the resulting function. The conditioning step can be performed using the methods that we have described in this paper, and the normalization constant can be computed by multiplying the normalization constant of each factor of the hierarchical decomposition. Thus, instead of resorting to the more complicated mathematics of inversion combinatorics, our theory of complete decomposability offers a simple conceptual way to understand why Mallows models can be conditioned efficiently on partial ranking observations.\nFinally in recent related work, Lu and Boutilier (2011) considered an even more general class of observations based on DAG (directed acyclic graph) based observations in which probabilities of rankings which are not consistent with a DAG of relative ranking relations are set to zero. Lu and Boutilier show in particular that the conditioning problem for their DAG-based class of observations is #P -hard. They additionally propose an efficient rejection sampling method for performing probabilistic inference within the general class of DAG observations and prove that the sampling method is exact for the class of partial rankings that we have discussed in this paper."}, {"heading": "8.

In previous work, we had used only the full rankings of the APA data (Huang & Guestrin, 2010, 2012), but now we are able to use the entire dataset. Figure 7(a) plots, for each k \u2208 {1, . . . , 5}, the number of ballots in the APA data of length k.\nLikewise, the Meath dataset (Gormley & Murphy, 2007) which was taken from the 2002 Irish Parliament election has over 60,000 top-k rankings of 14 candidates. As with the APA data, we had used only the full rankings of the Meath data in previous work, but here we use the entire dataset. Figure 7(b) plots, for each k \u2208 {1, . . . , 14}, the number of ballots in the Meath data of length k. In particular, note that the vast majority of ballots in the dataset consist of partial rather than full rankings, with over half of the electorate preferring to list only their favorite three or four candidates. We can run inference (Algorithm 1) on over 5000 top-k examples for the Meath data in 10 seconds on a dual 3.0 GHz Pentium machine with an unoptimized Python implementation. Using \u2018brute force\u2019 inference, we estimate that the same job would require roughly one hundred years.\nWe extracted a third dataset from a database of searchtrails collected by White and Drucker (2007), in which browsing sessions of roughly 2000 users were logged during 2008- 2009. In many cases, users are unlikely to read articles about the same news story twice, and so it is often possible to think of the order in which a user reads through a collection of articles as a top-k ranking over articles concerning a particular story/topic. The ability to model visit orderings would allow us to make long term predictions about user browsing behavior, or even recommend \u2018curriculums\u2019 over articles for users. We ran our algorithms on roughly 300 visit orderings for the eight most popular posts from www.huffingtonpost.com concerning \u2018Sarah Palin\u2019, a popular subject during the 2008 U.S. presidential election.

To better illustrate the benefits of partial rankings, we subsampled a dataset of 300 rankings (including both full and partial rankings) and present results with this smaller dataset. Performing structure learning using only the full rankings of these 300 training examples (consisting of roughly 100 examples), one obtains the structure in Figure 8(a), which can be seen to not match the \u2018correct\u2019 structure of Figure 3(a) which was learned using 5000 full rankings. Figures 8(b) and 8(c)\nplot the results of our EM algorithm with the former displaying the resulting structure after just a single EM iteration and the latter the result after structural convergence, which occurs by the third iteration, showing that our method can learn the \u2018correct\u2019 structure given just 300 training examples.\nWe compared our EM algorithm against two alternative baseline approaches that we refer to in our plots as FlatEM and Uniform Fill-in. The FlatEM algorithm is the same as the EM algorithm above except for two details: (1) it performs conditioning exhaustively instead of exploiting the factorized model structure, and (2) it performs the M-step without sampling. The Uniform Fill-in approach treats every top-k ranking in the training set as a uniform collection of votes for all of the full rankings consistent with that top-k ranking, and is accomplished by using just one iteration of our EM algorithm.\nIn Figure 9(a) we plot test set loglikelihoods corresponding to each approach, with EM and FlatEM having almost identical results and both performing much better than the Uniform Fill-in approach. On the other hand, Figure 9(b), which compares running times of the three approaches, shows that FlatEM can be far more costly (for most datasets, it cannot even be run in a reasonable amount of time).\nTo verify that partial rankings do indeed make a difference in the APA data, we plot the results of estimating a model from the subsets of APA training data consisting of top-k rankings with length larger than some fixed k. Figures 9(c) and 9(d) show the log-likelihood and running times for k = 0, 1, 2, 3 with k = 0 being the entire training set and k = 3 being the subset of training data consisting only of full rankings. As our results show, including partial rankings does indeed help on average for improving test log-likelihood (with diminishing returns)."}, {"heading": "8.3 Structure Discovery with EM with Larger n.", "text": "Our experiments have led to several observations about using EM for learning with partial rankings. First, we observe that typical runs converge to a fixed structure quickly, with no more than three EM iterations.

As expected, the log-likelihood increases at each iteration, and we remark that the structure becomes more interpretable \u2014 for example, the leaf set {0, 2, 3} corresponds to the three posts about Palin\u2019s wardrobe before the election, while the posts from the leaf set {1, 4, 6} were related to verbal gaffes made by Palin during the campaign. Notice that this structure is discovered purely using data about visit orders and that no text information was used in our experiments.\nSecondly, the number of EM iterations required to reach convergence in log-likelihood depends on the types of partial rankings observed. We ran our algorithm on subsets of the Meath dataset, each time training on m = 2000 rankings all with length larger than\nsome fixed k. Figure 11(a) shows the number of iterations required for convergence as a function of k (with 20 bootstrap trials for each k). We observe fastest convergence for datasets consisting of almost-full rankings and slowest convergence for those consisting of almost-empty rankings, with almost 25 iterations necessary if one trains using rankings of all types.

We repeat each setting with 20 bootstrap trials, and for evaluation, we compute the log-likelihood of a testset with 5000 examples. For speed, we learn a structure H only once and fix H to learn parameters for each trial.

Figure 11(b) shows (naturally) that when the data are drawn synthetically from a riffle independent model, then our EM method significantly outperforms the LM08 estimator. We remark that in theory, the LM08 is guaranteed to catch up in performance (under appropriate conditions) given enough training examples.\nFor the Meath data, which is only approximately riffle independent, we trained on subsets of size 5,000 and 25,000 (testing on remaining data). For each subset, we evaluated our EM algorithm for learning a riffle independent model against the LM08 estimator when (1) using only full ranking data, and (2) using all data. As before, both methods do better when partial rankings are made available.\nFor the smaller training set, the riffle independent model performs as well or better than the LM\u201908 estimator. For the larger training set of 25,000, we see that the nonparametric method starts to perform slightly better on average, the advantage of a nonparametric model being that it is guaranteed to be consistent, converging to the correct model given enough data. The advantage of riffle independent models, however, is that they are simple, interpretable, and can highlight global structures hidden within the data."}, {"heading": "9.

While the space of partial rankings is both rich and useful in many settings, it does not cover an important class of observations: that of incomplete rankings, which are defined to be a ranking (or partial ranking) of a subset of the itemset \u2126. For example, Theorem 21 shows that the conditioning problem for pairwise observations of the form \u201cApples are preferred over Bananas\u201d is nondecomposable. Note that top-k rankings are considered to be \u201ccomplete\u201d rankings since they implicitly rank all other items in the last n\u2212 k positions.\nHow then, can we tractably condition on incomplete rankings? One possible approach is to convert to a Fourier representation using the methods from (Huang & Guestrin, 2012), then conditioning on a pairwise ranking observation using the Fourier domain conditioning algorithm proposed in (Huang et al., 2008). This Fourier domain approach would be useful if one were particularly interested in low-order marginal probabilities of the posterior distributions.\nWhen the Fourier approach is not viable, another option may be to assume that the posterior distribution takes on a particular riffle independent structure (in the same way that mean field methods from the graphical models literature would assume a factorized posterior). The research question of interest is: which hierarchical structure should be used for the purposes of approximating the posterior?"}, {"heading": "9.2 Reexamining Data Independence Assumptions", "text": "In this paper, we have assumed throughout that training examples are independent and identically distributed. However in practice these are not always safe assumptions as a number of factors can impact the validity of both. For example, in an internet survey in which a user must perform a series of preference ranking tasks in sequence, a concern is that the user\u2019s prior ranking tasks may bias the results of his future rankings.\nAnother source of bias lies in the reference ranking that may be displayed, in which the user is asked to rearrange items by \u2018dragging and dropping\u2019. On the one hand, showing everyone the same reference ranking may bias the resulting data. But on the other hand, showing every user a different reference ranking may mean that the training examples are not exactly identically distributed.\nYet another form of bias lies in the partial ranking types that are reported in data. To formulate our EM algorithm, we have assumed that a user\u2019s preferences does not influence whether he chooses to, say, report a full ranking instead of a top-3 ranking. In practice, however, partial ranking types and user preferences are often correlated. In the Irish elections, for example, where there is typically only one Sinn Fein candidate, those who rank Sinn Fein first are typically more likely to have only reported their top-1 choice.\nUnderstanding, identifying, and finally, learning in spite of the different types of biases that may occur in eliciting preference data remains a fundamental problem in ranking."}, {"heading": "9.3 Probabilistic Modeling of Strategic Voting", "text": "It is interesting to consider the differences between the actual vote distributions considered in this paper against the approximate riffle independent distributions. Take the APA dataset, for example, in which the optimal approximation by a riffle independent hierarchy reflects the underlying political coalitions within the organization. Upon comparison between the approximation and the empirical distribution, however, some marked differences arise. For example, the riffle independent approximation underestimates the number of votes obtained by candidate 3 (a research psychologist) who ultimately won the election.\nOne possible explanation for the discrepancy may lie in the idea that voters tend to vote strategically in APA elections, placing stronger candidates of opposing political coalitions lower in the ranking, rather than revealing their true preferences. An interesting line of future work lies in detecting and studying the presence of such strategic voting in election datasets. Open questions include (1) verifying mathematically whether strategic voting does indeed exist in, say, the APA election data, and (2) if so, why the strategic voting effect is not strong enough to overwhelm our riffled independence structure learning algorithms, and (3) how strategic voting can manifest itself in partial ranking votes."}, {"heading": "10. Conclusion", "text": "In probabilistic reasoning problems, it is often the case that certain data types suggest certain distribution representations. For example, sparse dependency structure in the data often suggests a Markov random field (or other graphical model) representation (Friedman, 1997, 1998).

For preference ranking scenarios, one must contend with \u2018human task complexity\u2019 \u2014 the difficulty involved for a human to rank a long list of items and often leads to partially, instead of fully ranked data. In this paper, we have shown that when data takes the form of partial rankings, then hierarchical riffle independent models are a natural representation.\nAs with conjugate priors, we showed that a riffle independent model is guaranteed to retain its factorization structure after conditioning on a partial ranking (which can be performed in efficiently). Most surprisingly, our work shows that observations which do not take the form of partial rankings are not amenable to simple multiplicative update based conditioning algorithms.

To show that \u03b4S\u03b3\u03c0 decomposes hierarchically, we must also show that the relative ranking factors fA and gB decompose with respect to HA and HB, the subhierarchies over the item sets A and B. To establish this second step (assuming that Equation A.1 holds), note that fA and gB are indicator functions for the restricted partial rankings, [S\u03b3\u03c3]A and [S\u03b3\u03c3]B, which themselves are partial rankings over smaller item sets A and B. The inductive hypothesis (and the fact that A and B are assumed to be strictly smaller sets than \u2126) then shows that the functions fA and gB both factor according to their respective subhierarchies.\nWe now turn to establishing Equation A.1. It suffices to prove that the following two statements are equivalent:\nI. The ranking \u03c3 is consistent with the partial ranking S\u03b3\u03c0 (i.e., \u03c3 \u2208 S\u03b3\u03c0). II. The following three conditions hold:\n(a) The interleaving \u03c4AB(\u03c3) is consistent with S\u03b3\u03c0 (i.e., \u03c4AB(\u03c3) \u2208 [S\u03b3\u03c0]AB), and (b) The relative ranking \u03c6A(\u03c3) is consistent with S\u03b3\u03c0 (i.e., \u03c6A(\u03c3) \u2208 [S\u03b3\u03c0]A), and (c) The relative ranking \u03c6B(\u03c3) is consistent with S\u03b3\u03c0 (i.e., \u03c6B(\u03c3) \u2208 [S\u03b3\u03c0]B).\n\u2022 (I \u21d2 II): We first show that \u03c3 \u2208 S\u03b3\u03c0 implies conditions (a), (b) and (c).\n(a) If \u03c3 \u2208 S\u03b3\u03c0, then for each i,\n|j \u2208 R\u03b3i : \u03c4AB(j) = A| = |j \u2208 R \u03b3 i : \u03c3 \u22121(j) \u2208 A|, (by Definition 2) = |k \u2208 \u2126i : k \u2208 A|, (by Proposition 33) = |\u2126i \u2229A|.\nThe same argument (replacing A with B) shows that for each i, we have |j \u2208 R\u03b3i : \u03c4AB(j) = B| = |\u2126i \u2229B|. These two conditions (by Definition 17) show that \u03c4AB is consistent with S\u03b3\u03c0. (b) If \u03c3 \u2208 S\u03b3\u03c0, then (by Definition 14) \u03c3 ranks items in \u2126i before items in \u2126j for any i < j. Intersecting each \u2126i with A, we also see that \u03c3 ranks any item in \u2126i \u2229 A before any item in \u2126j \u2229A for all i, j. By Definition 2, \u03c6A(\u03c3) also ranks any item in \u2126i\u2229A before any item in \u2126j \u2229A for all i, j. And finally by Definition 16 again, we see that \u03c6A(\u03c3) is consistent with the partial ranking S\u03b3\u03c0. (c) (Same argument as (b)).\n\u2022 (II \u21d2 I): We now assume conditions (a), (b), and (c) to hold, and show that \u03c3 \u2208 S\u03b3\u03c0. By Proposition 33 it is sufficient to show that if an item k \u2208 \u2126i, then \u03c3(k) \u2208 R\u03b3i . To prove this claim, we show by induction on i that if an item k \u2208 \u2126i\u2229A, then \u03c3(k) \u2208 R\u03b3i (and similarly if k \u2208 \u2126i \u2229B, then \u03c3(k) \u2208 R\u03b3i ). Base case. In the base case (i = 1), we assume that k \u2208 \u21261\u2229A, and the goal is to show that \u03c3(k) \u2208 R1. By condition (a), we have that \u03c4AB(\u03c3) \u2208 [S\u03b3\u03c0]AB. By Definition 17, this means that: |\u21261 \u2229 A| = {j \u2208 R1 : [\u03c4AB(\u03c3)](j) = A} = {j \u2208 R1 : \u03c3\u22121(j) \u2208 A}. In words, there are m = |\u21261\u2229A| items from A which lie in rank set R1 = {1, . . . , \u03b31}. To show that an item k \u2208 A maps to a rank in R1, we now must show that in the relative ranking of elements in A, k is among the first m. By condition (b), \u03c6A(\u03c3) \u2208 [S\u03b3\u03c0]A, implying that the item subset \u21261 \u2229 A occupies the first m positions in the relative ranking of A. Since k \u2208 \u21261 \u2229 A, item k is among the first m items ranked by \u03c6A(\u03c3) and therefore \u03c3(k) \u2208 R1. A similar argument shows that k \u2208 \u21261 \u2229 B implise that \u03c3(k) \u2208 R1. Inductive case. We now show that if k \u2208 \u2126i \u2229 A, then \u03c3(k) \u2208 Ri. By condition (b), \u03c6A(\u03c3) \u2208 [S\u03b3\u03c0]A, implying that the item subset \u2126i\u2229A (and hence, item k) occupies the first m = |\u2126i \u2229 A| positions in the relative ranking of A beyond the items \u222ai\u22121j=1(\u2126j \u2229 A). By the inductive hypothesis and mutual exclusivity, these items, together with \u222ai\u22121j=1(\u2126j \u2229 B) occupy ranks \u222a i\u22121 j=1Rj , and therefore \u03c3(k) \u2208 R` for some ` \u2265 i. On the\nother hand, condition (a) assures us that |\u2126i \u2229 A| = {j \u2208 Ri : \u03c3\u22121(j) \u2208 A} \u2014 or in other words, that the ranks in Ri are occupied by exactly m items of A. Therefore, \u03c3(k) \u2208 Ri. Again, a similar argument shows that k \u2208 \u2126i \u2229B implies that \u03c3(k) \u2208 Ri.\nA.2 The pspan of a Set is Always a Partial Ranking\nTo reason about the pspan of a set of rankings, we first introduce some basic concepts regarding the combinatorics of partial rankings. The collection of partial rankings over \u2126\nforms a partially ordered set (poset) where S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032 \u227a S\u03b3\u03c0 if S\u03b3\u03c0 can be obtained from S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032 by dropping vertical lines. For example, on S3, we have that 1|2|3 \u227a 12|3. The Hasse diagram is the graph in which each node corresponds to a partial ranking and a node x is connected to node y via an edge if x \u227a y and there exists no partial ranking z such that x \u227a z \u227a y (see Lebanon & Mao, 2008). At the top of the Hasse diagram is the partial ranking 1, 2, . . . , n (i.e., all of S\u2126) and at the bottom of the Hasse diagram lie the full rankings. See Figure 13 for an example of the partial ranking lattice on S3.\nLemma 34. [Lebanon & Mao, 2008] Given any two partial rankings S\u03b3\u03c0, S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032, there exists a unique supremum of S\u03b3\u03c0 and S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032 (a node S\u03b3sup\u03c0sup such that S\u03b3\u03c0 \u227a S\u03b3sup\u03c0sup and S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032 \u227a S\u03b3sup\u03c0sup, and any other such node is greater than S\u03b3sup\u03c0sup). Similarly, there exists a unique infimum of S\u03b3\u03c0 and S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032.\nLemma 35. Given two partial rankings S\u03b3\u03c0, S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032, the relation S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032 \u2282 S\u03b3\u03c0 holds if and only S\u03b3\u03c0 lies above S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032 in the Hasse diagram.\nProof. If S\u03b3\u03c0 lies above S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032 in the Hasse diagram, then S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032 \u2282 S\u03b3\u03c0 is trivial since S\u03b3\u03c0 can be obtained by dropping vertical bars of S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032. Now given that S\u03b3\u03c0 does not lie above S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\n\u2032, we would like to show that S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032 6\u2282 S\u03b3\u03c0. Let S\u03b3inf\u03c0inf be the unique infimum of S\u03b3\u03c0 and S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032 as guaranteed by Lemma 34. By the definition of the Hasse diagram, both S\u03b3\u03c0 and S\u03b3\u03c0 can be obtained by \u2018dropping\u2019 verticals from the vertical bar representation of S\u03b3inf\u03c0inf . Since S\u03b3\u03c0 does not lie above S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\n\u2032, there must be a vertical bar that was dropped by S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032 which was not dropped by S\u03b3\u03c0 (if there does not exist such a bar, then S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\n\u2032 \u2282 S\u03b3\u03c0), and hence there must exist a pair of items i, j separated by a single vertical bar in S\u03b3\u03c0 but unseparated in S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032. Therefore there exists \u03c3 \u2208 S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032 such that \u03c3(j) < \u03c3(i) even though there exists no such \u03c3 \u2208 S\u03b3\u03c0. We conclude that S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032 6\u2282 S\u03b3\u03c0.\nLemma 36 (Lemma 23 in main body). For any X \u2282 Sn, pspan(X) is a partial ranking.\nProof. Consider any subset X \u2282 Sn. A partial ranking containing every element in X must be an upper bound of every element of X in the Hasse diagram by Lemma 35. By Lemma 34, there must exist a unique least upper bound (supremum) of X, S\u03b3sup\u03c0sup, such that for any common upper bound S\u03b3\u03c0 of X, S\u03b3\u03c0 must also be an ancestor of S\u03b3sup\u03c0sup and hence S\u03b3sup\u03c0sup \u2282 S\u03b3\u03c0. We therefore see that any partial ranking containing X must be a superset of S\u03b3sup\u03c0sup. On the other hand, S\u03b3sup\u03c0sup is itself a partial ranking containing X. Since pspan(X) is the intersection of partial rankings containing X, we have pspan(X) = S\u03b3sup\u03c0sup and therefore that pspan(X) must be a partial ranking.\nA.3 Proofs for the Claim that rspan(X) = pspan(X)\nTo simplify the notation in some of the remaining proofs, we introduce the following definition.\nDefinition 37 (Ties). Given a partial ranking S\u03b3\u03c0 = \u21261| . . . |\u2126r, we say that items a1 and a2 are tied (written a1 \u223c a2) with respect to S\u03b3\u03c3 if a1, a2 \u2208 \u2126i for some i.\nThe following basic properties of the tie relation are straightforward.\nProposition 38.\n123\n1|2|3 1|3|2 2|1|3 3|1|2 2|3|1 3|2|1"}, {"heading": "1|23 12|3 13|2 2|13 3|12 23|1", "text": "Proposition 39. Given a set of rankings X as input, Algorithm 2 outputs pspan(X).\nProof. We prove three things, which together prove the proposition: (1) that the algorithm terminates, (2) that at each stage the elements of X are contained in pspan(X), and (3) that upon termination, pspan(X) is contained in each element of X.\n1. First we note that the algorithm must terminate in finitely many iterations of the while loop since at each stage at least one vertical bar is removed from a partial ranking, and when all of the vertical bars have been removed from the elements of X, there are no disagreements on relative ordering.\n2. We now show that at any stage in the algorithm, every element of Xt is a subset of the pspan(X). At initialization, of course, if S\u03b3\u03c0 \u2208 X0, then it is simply a singleton set consisting of an element of X, and therefore S\u03b3\u03c0 \u2282 pspan(X). Suppose now that S\u03b3\u03c0 \u2282 pspan(X) for every S\u03b3\u03c0 \u2208 Xt. If S\u03b3\u03c0 is replaced by S\u03b3\u0303 \u03c0\u0303 in Xt+1, then we want to show that S\u03b3\u0303 \u03c0\u0303 \u2282 pspan(X) as well. From Algorithm 2, for some j, if S\u03b3\u03c0 = \u21261| . . . |\u2126j |\u2126j+1| . . . |\u2126r, S\u03b3\u0303 \u03c0\u0303 can be written as \u21261| . . . |\u2126j \u222a \u2126j+1| . . . |\u2126r, where the vertical bar between \u2126j and \u2126j+1 is deleted due to the existence of some partial ranking in Xt, S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032 \u2208 Xt which disagrees with S\u03b3\u03c0 on the relative ordering of items a1, a2 on opposite sides of the bar. Since S\u03b3\u03c0 and S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032 are both subsets of pspan(X) by assumption, we know that a1 \u223c a2 with respect to pspan(X) (Proposition 38, II). Suppose now that a1 \u2208 \u2126i and a2 \u2208 \u2126i\u2032 . Then for any x \u2208 \u2126i and y \u2208 \u2126i\u2032 , we have x \u223c a1 and y \u223c a2 with respect to pspan(X) by (III) of Proposition 38. Moreover, by (I, transitivity), we see that x \u223c y with respect to pspan(X). for any two elements of \u2126i and \u2126i\u2032 . By (IV) of Proposition 38, all the items lying in \u2126i,\u2126i+1, . . . ,\u2126i\u2032 are thus tied with respect to pspan(X) and therefore removing any bar between items a1 and a2 (producing, for example, S\u03b3\u0303 \u03c0\u0303) results in a partial ranking which is a subset of pspan(X).\n3. Finally, upon termination, if some ranking \u03c3 \u2208 X is not contained in some element S\u03b3\u03c0 \u2208 Xt, then there would exist two items a1, a2 whose relative ranking \u03c3 and S\u03b3\u03c0 disagree upon, which is a contradiction. Therefore, every element S\u03b3\u03c0 \u2208 Xt contains every element of X and thus pspan(X) \u2282 S\u03b3\u03c0 for every S\u03b3\u03c0 \u2208 Xt.\nLemma 40. Let S\u03b3\u03c0 = \u21261| . . . |\u2126i|\u2126i+1| . . . |\u2126k be a partial ranking on item set \u2126, and S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\n\u2032 = \u21261| . . . |\u2126i \u222a \u2126i+1| . . . |\u2126k, the partial ranking in which the sets \u2126i and \u2126i+1 are merged. Let a1 \u2208 \u222aij=1\u2126j and a2 \u2208 \u222akj=i+1\u2126j. If O is any element of C such that S\u03b3\u03c0 \u2282 O and there additionally exists a ranking \u03c0\u0303 \u2208 O which disagrees with S\u03b3\u03c0 on the relative ordering of a1, a2, then S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032 \u2282 O.\nProof. We will fix a completely decomposable O and again work with h, the indicator distribution corresponding to O. Let \u03c3 \u2208 S\u03b3\u2032\u03c0\u2032. To prove the lemma, we need to establish that h(\u03c3) > 0. Let \u03c30 be any element of S\u03b3\u03c0 such that \u03c30(k) = \u03c3(k) for all k \u2208 \u2126\\(\u2126i\u222a\u2126i+1). Since S\u03b3\u03c0 \u2282 supp(h) by assumption, we have that h(\u03c30) > 0.\nSince \u03c30 and \u03c3 match on all items except for those in \u2126i \u222a\u2126i+1, there exists a sequence of rankings \u03c30, \u03c31, \u03c32, . . . , \u03c3m = \u03c3 such that adjacent rankings in this sequence differ only by a pairwise exchange of items b1, b2 \u2208 \u2126i \u222a \u2126i+1. We will now show that at each step along this sequence, h(\u03c3t) > 0 implies that h(\u03c3t+1) > 0, which will prove that h(\u03c3) > 0. Suppose now that h(\u03c3t) > 0 and that \u03c3t and \u03c3t+1 differ only by the relative ranking of items b1, b2 \u2208 \u2126i \u222a\u2126i+1 (without loss of generality, we will assume that \u03c3t(b2) < \u03c3t(b1) and \u03c3t+1(b1) < \u03c3\nt+1(b2)). The idea of the following paragraph is to use the previous lemma (Lemma 28) to prove that \u03c3t+1 has positive probability and to do so, it will be necessary to argue that there exists some ranking \u03c3\u2032 such that h(\u03c3\u2032) > 0 and \u03c3\u2032(b1) < \u03c3\u2032(b2) (i.e., \u03c3\u2032 disagrees with \u03c3t on the relative ranking of b1, b2). Let \u03c9 be any element of S\u03b3\u03c0. If a1 \u2208 \u2126i, rearrange \u03c9 such that a1 is ranked first among elements of \u2126i. If a2 \u2208 \u2126i+1, further rearrange \u03c9 such that a2 is ranked last among elements of \u2126i+1. Note that \u03c9 is still an element of S\u03b3\u03c0 after the possible rearrangements and therefore h(\u03c9) > 0. We can assume that \u03c9(b2) < \u03c9(b1) since otherwise we will have shown what we wanted to show. Thus the relative ordering of a1, a2, b1, b2 within \u03c9 is a1|b2|b1|a2. Note that we treat the case where the items a1, a2, b1, b2 are distinct, but the same argument follows in the cases when a1 = b2 or a2 = b1.\nNow since \u03c0\u0303 disagrees with S\u03b3\u03c0 on the relative ordering of a1, a2 by assumption (and hence disagrees with \u03c9), we apply Lemma 28 to conclude that swapping the relative ordering of a1, a2 within \u03c9 (obtaining a2|b2|b1|a1) results in a ranking, \u03c9\u2032, such that h(\u03c9\u2032) > 0. Finally, observe that \u03c9 and \u03c9\u2032 must now disagree on the relative ranking of a2, b2, and invoking Lemma 28 again shows that we can swap the relative ordering of a2, b2 within \u03c9 (obtaining a1|a2|b1|b2) to result in a ranking \u03c3\u2032 such that h(\u03c3\u2032) > 0. This element \u03c3\u2032 ranks b1 before b2, which is what we wanted to show.\nWe have shown that there exist rankings which disagree on the relative ordering of b1 and b2 with positive probability under h. Again applying Lemma 28 shows that we can swap the relative ordering of items b1, b2 within \u03c3t to obtain \u03c3t+1 such that h(\u03c3t+1) > 0, which concludes the proof.\nA.4 Uniformity of C\u0303 Functions Over a Partial Ranking\nWe have thus far shown that any element of C\u0303 must be supported on some partial ranking. In the following, we show that (up to a certain class of exceptions), such an element must assign uniform probability to all members of this partial ranking.\nTheorem 41. If h is any completely decomposable function supported on a partial ranking S\u03b3\u03c0 = \u21261| . . . |\u2126r where |\u2126i| 6= 2 for all i = 1, . . . , r, then h is uniform on S\u03b3\u03c0 (i.e., h(\u03c3) = 1\u220f\ni |\u2126i| for all \u03c3 \u2208 S\u03b3\u03c0).\nTo establish Theorem 41, we must establish two supporting results: (1) Lemma 42 which factors h into r smaller completely decomposable functions, each of which is nonzero everywhere on its domain, and (2) Theorem 43 which establishes uniformity for any completely decomposable function which is nonzero everywhere on its domain.\nLemma 42. Any completely decomposable function, h, supported on the partial ranking S\u03b3\u03c0 = \u21261| . . . |\u2126r, must factor as: h(\u03c3) = \u220fr i=1 h(\u03c3(\u2126i)), where each factor distribution h(\u03c3(\u2126i)) is itself a completely decomposable function on S\u2126i .\nProof. Since h is completely decomposable, we have that \u03c3(\u2126i) is riffle independent of \u03c3(\u2126\\\u2126i) for each i. Since h is supported on the partial ranking S\u03b3\u03c0 = \u2126)1| . . . |\u2126r, however, the interleaving of \u2126i with its complement is deterministic and therefore we conclude in fact that \u03c3(\u2126i) is fully independent of \u03c3(\u2126\\\u2126i). Since \u03c3(\u2126i) \u22a5 \u03c3(\u2126\\\u2126i) for each i, we have the factorization: h(\u03c3) = \u220fr i=1 h(\u03c3(\u2126i)).\nWe now turn to establishing that each factor h(\u03c3(\u2126i)) is itself a completely decomposable observation. Fix i = 1 (without loss of generality) and consider any partition of the set \u21261 into subsets A\u222aB. We would like to see that the sets A and B are riffle independent of each other with respect to h(\u03c3(\u21261)). Since h is assumed to be completely decomposable, we know that A is riffle independent of its complement, B\u222a(\u2126\\\u21261). In other words, if B\u0303 = B\u222a(\u2126\\\u21261), then the variables \u03c6A(\u03c3), \u03c4AB\u0303, \u03c6B\u0303 (the relative ranking of A, the interleaving of A with all remaining items, and the relative ranking of all remaining items, respectively) are mutually independent. We then observe that (1) the interleaving of A and B, \u03c4AB, is a deterministic function of the interleaving of \u03c4AB\u0303 and (2) the relative ranking of B, \u03c6B, is a deterministic function of \u03c6B\u0303, thus proving that \u03c6A, \u03c4AB and \u03c6B are mutually independent and hence that A and B are riffle independent.\nTheorem 43. Let h a completely decomposable function such that h(\u03c3) > 0 for all \u03c3 \u2208 Sn for n > 2. Then for any two rankings \u03c31, \u03c32 which differ by a single transposition, we have h(\u03c31) = h(\u03c32).\nOur proof strategy for Theorem 43 will involve examining the ratio between the two probabilities h(\u03c31) and h(\u03c32). We then define an operation transforming \u03c31 and \u03c32 into new rankings \u03c3\u20321 and \u03c3\u20322 such that the ratio between the rankings is preserved (i.e., h(\u03c31)/h(\u03c32) = h(\u03c3\u20321)/h(\u03c3 \u2032 2)). By performing a sequence of such ratio-preserving operations, we show that:\nh(\u03c31) h(\u03c32) = h(\u03c32) h(\u03c31) ,\nfrom which Theorem 43 easily follows.\nWe will use two types of operations which transform a ranking into a new ranking: (1) changing the interleaving of two sets A and B within a ranking \u03c3, and (2), changing the relative ranking of a set A within a ranking \u03c3. More precisely, given a ranking \u03c3 and a partitioning of the item set into subsets A and B, we can uniquely index \u03c3 as a triplet (\u03c4, \u03c0A, \u03c0B), where \u03c4 = \u03c4A,B(\u03c3), \u03c0A = \u03c6A(\u03c3), and \u03c0B = \u03c6B(\u03c3). The two operations are defined as follows:\n1. Changing the interleaving of A,B within \u03c3 to \u03c4 \u2032: yields the new ranking \u03c3\u2032 which is indexed by (\u03c4 \u2032, \u03c0A, \u03c0B).\n2. Changing the relative ranking of A (or B) within \u03c3 to \u03c0\u2032A (or \u03c0 \u2032 B): yields the new\nranking \u03c3\u2032 which is indexed by (\u03c4, \u03c0\u2032A, \u03c0B) [or (\u03c4, \u03c0A, \u03c0 \u2032 B)].\nIf we use the above operations to obtain from \u03c3\u20321 and \u03c3\u20322, we are interested in conditions under which this transformation is ratio-preserving (i.e., h(\u03c31)/h(\u03c32) = h(\u03c3\u20321)/h(\u03c3\u20322)). The following lemma provides sufficient conditions for ratio-preservation.\nLemma 44. Let h be any completely decomposable function and consider \u03c31, \u03c32 \u2208 Sn such that h(\u03c32) > 0. Then for any partitioning of the item set into subsets A and B, we have:\n1. If \u03c31 and \u03c32 match on the interleaving of A and B (i.e., \u03c4A,B(\u03c31) = \u03c4AB(\u03c32)), then h(\u03c31) h(\u03c32) = h(\u03c3\u20321) h(\u03c3\u20322) , where \u03c3\u20321 and \u03c3 \u2032 2 are formed by changing the interleaving of the sets A\nand B within \u03c31 and \u03c32 to be any new interleaving \u03c4 \u2032.\n2. If \u03c31 and \u03c32 match on the relative ranking of A (or B) (i.e., \u03c6A(\u03c31) = \u03c6A(\u03c32) (or \u03c6B(\u03c31) = \u03c6B(\u03c32))), then\nh(\u03c31) h(\u03c32) = h(\u03c3\u20321) h(\u03c3\u20322) , where \u03c3\u20321 and \u03c3 \u2032 2 are formed by changing the\nrelative ranking of set A (or B) within \u03c31 and \u03c32 to be any new relative ranking \u03c0\u2032A (or \u03c0\u2032B).\nProof. Since the proofs of parts 1 and 2 are nearly identical, we just prove part 1 here. Since h \u2208 C, the sets A and B are riffle independent by assumption, and hence we have the factorizations:\nh(\u03c31) h(\u03c32) = m(\u03c41) \u00b7 f(\u03c0A1 ) \u00b7 g(\u03c0B2 ) m(\u03c42) \u00b7 f(\u03c0A2 ) \u00b7 g(\u03c0B2 ) .\nIf \u03c31 and \u03c32 match on the interleaving of the sets A and B, then we have that \u03c4 = \u03c41 = \u03c42, and thus the interleaving terms, m(\u03c41) and m(\u03c42) are the same in both the numerator and denominator.\nOn the other hand, if we examine the ratio between h(\u03c3\u20321) and h(\u03c3\u20322), we also see that the interleaving terms must cancel:\nh(\u03c31) h(\u03c32) = m(\u03c4 \u20321) \u00b7 f(\u03c0A1 ) \u00b7 g(\u03c0B2 ) m(\u03c4 \u20322) \u00b7 f(\u03c0A2 ) \u00b7 g(\u03c0B2 ) .\nWe therefore have that: h(\u03c31)\nh(\u03c32) = f(\u03c0A1 ) \u00b7 g(piB1 ) f(\u03c0A2 ) \u00b7 g(\u03c0B2 ) = h(\u03c3\u20321) h(\u03c3\u20322) .\nHaving now established Lemma 44, we turn to establishing three short claims (using the lemma) that will allow us to prove finally prove Theorem 43. It is interesting to note that we require n > 2 (strictly) in claim III below in which we swap the order of i and j in numerator and denominator. The third item k in our proof below can be thought of as playing the role of a dummy variable analogous to the temporary storage variables that one might use in implementing a swap function. The necessity of this third item is precisely why our result does not hold in the special case that n = 2.\nProposition 45. Let h : Sn \u2192 R be a completely decomposable function with n > 2 with h(\u03c3) > 0 for all \u03c3 \u2208 Sn. We have the following equivalences (where in each of the below ratios, entries which have not been explicitly written out are assumed to match identically in both the numerator and denominator).\nI. h(i|j| . . . |k| . . . ) h(j|i| . . . |k| . . . ) = h(i|j|k| . . . ) h(j|i|k| . . . ) .\nII. h(. . . |i| . . . |j| . . . ) h(. . . |j| . . . |i| . . . ) = h(i|j| . . . ) h(j|i| . . . ) .\nIII. h(i|j|k| . . . ) h(j|i|k| . . . ) = h(j|i|k| . . . ) h(i|j|k| . . . ) .\nProof.\nI. Equality holds in I since \u03c31 and \u03c32 match on the interleaving of the sets A = {k} with B = \u2126\\{k}. Thus we can change the interleaving of A and B in both \u03c31 and \u03c32 so that item k is inserted in rank 3 while preserving the ratio.\nII. Equality holds in II since \u03c31 and \u03c32 match on the interleaving of the sets A = {i, j} with B = \u2126\\{i, j}. Thus we can change the interleaving of A and B in both \u03c31 and \u03c32 so that items i and j occupy the first two ranks while preserving the ratio between h(\u03c31) and h(\u03c32).\nIII. In the following we use \u03c31 and \u03c32 to refer to the arguments in the numerator and denominator, respectively, of the preceding line.\nh(i|j|k| . . . ) h(j|i|k| . . . ) = h(i|k|j| . . . ) h(k|i|j| . . . ) , (since \u03c31, \u03c32 match on the relative ranking of {j, k})\n= h(j|i|k| . . . ) h(j|k|i| . . . ) , (since \u03c31, \u03c32 match on the interleaving of {j} with \u2126\\{j}) = h(i|j|k| . . . ) h(i|k|j| . . . ) , (since \u03c31, \u03c32 match on the relative ranking of {i, j}) = h(k|j|i| . . . ) h(k|i|j| . . . ) , (since \u03c31, \u03c32 match on the relative ranking of {i, k}) = h(j|i|k| . . . ) h(i|j|k| . . . ) , (since \u03c31, \u03c32 match on the interleaving of {k} with \u2126\\{k}).\nProof. (of Theorem 43) We want to show that if two rankings differ by a single transposition, then they are assigned equal probability under h. Suppose then that \u03c32 is obtained from \u03c31 by swapping the ranks of items i and j. Additionally, let k be any item besides i and j (such an item must exist since n > 2). In the following, we use Proposition 45 to show that h(\u03c31)/h(\u03c32) = h(\u03c32)/h(\u03c31). As before, entries which have not been explicitly written out are assumed to match identically in both the numerator and denominator.\nh(\u03c31) h(\u03c32) = h(. . . |i| . . . |j| . . . ) h(. . . |j| . . . |i| . . . ) = h(i|j| . . . ) h(j|i| . . . ) , (by Prop. 45, Part II)\n= h(i|j| . . . |k| . . . ) h(j|i| . . . |k| . . . ) = h(i|j|k| . . . ) h(j|i|k| . . . ) , (by Prop. 45, Part I) = h(j|i|k| . . . ) h(i|j|k| . . . ) , (by Prop. 45, Part III) = h(j|i| . . . |k| . . . ) h(i|j| . . . |k| . . . ) , (by Prop. 45, Part I) = h(j|i| . . . ) h(i|j| . . . ) = h(. . . |j| . . . |i| . . . ) h(. . . |i| . . . |j| . . . ) , (by Prop. 45, Part II)\n= h(\u03c32)\nh(\u03c31) .\nSince we have assumed h(\u03c31) and h(\u03c32) > 0, we must conclude that h(\u03c31) = h(\u03c32).\nFinally, we assemble all of our supporting results to prove Theorem 41.\nProof. (of Theorem 41) By Lemma 42, a completely decomposable function h must factor as:\nh(\u03c3) = r\u220f i=1 h(\u03c3(\u2126i)), (A.2)\nwhere each factor distribution h(\u03c3(\u2126i)) is itself a completely decomposable function on S\u2126i . By assumption, |\u2126i| 6= 2. If |\u2126i| = 1, then its corresponding factor h(\u03c3(\u2126i)) must trivially be uniform. Otherwise, we have that |\u2126i| > 2. In this latter case, we apply Theorem 43 to h(\u03c3(\u2126i)) to show that it must assign equal probability to any two rankings that differ by a single transposition. However, given any rankings \u03c31, \u03c32 \u2208 S\u2126i , we can obtain a sequence of transpositions that transforms \u03c31 into \u03c32, and therefore, Theorem 43 in fact implies that the factor h(\u03c3(\u2126i)) is constant on all inputs. Having proved that each factor in Equation A.2 is constant, we conclude that h must be constant on its support."}], "references": [{"title": "Aggregation of partial rankings, p-ratings and top-m lists", "author": ["N.

Modeling such distributions presents several computational challenges, however, due to the factorial size of the set of rankings over an item set. Some of these challenges are quite familiar to the artificial intelligence community, such as how to compactly represent a distribution over a combinatorially large space, and how to efficiently perform probabilistic inference with these representations. With respect to ranking, however, there is the additional challenge of what we refer to as human task complexity \u2014 users are rarely willing to provide a full ranking over a long list of candidates, instead often preferring to provide partial ranking information. Simultaneously addressing all of these challenges \u2014 i.e., designing a compactly representable model which is amenable to efficient inference and can be learned using partial ranking data \u2014 is a difficult task, but is necessary if we would like to scale to problems with nontrivial size. In this paper, we show that the recently proposed riffled independence assumptions cleanly and efficiently address each of the above challenges. In particular, we establish a tight mathematical connection between the concepts of riffled independence and of partial rankings. This correspondence not only allows us to then develop efficient and exact algorithms for performing inference tasks using riffled independence based representations with partial rankings, but somewhat surprisingly, also shows that efficient inference is not possible for riffle independent models (in a certain sense) with observations which do not take the form of partial rankings. Finally, using our inference algorithm, we introduce the first method for learning riffled independence based models from partially ranked data. 1. Probabilistic Modeling of Ranking Data: Three Challenges Rankings arise in a number of machine learning application settings such as preference analysis for movies and books (Lebanon & Mao, 2008) and political election analysis (Gormley & Murphy, 2007; Huang & Guestrin, 2010). In many of these problems, it is of great interest to build statistical models over ranking data in order to make predictions, form recommendations, discover latent trends and structure and to construct human-comprehensible data summaries. c \u00a92012 AI Access Foundation.

Huang, Kapoor & Guestrin Modeling distributions over rankings is a difficult problem, however, due to the fact that as the number of items being ranked increases, the number of possible rankings increases factorially. This combinatorial explosion forces us to confront three central challenges when dealing with rankings. First, we need to deal with storage complexity \u2014 how can we compactly represent a distribution over the space of rankings?1 Then there is algorithmic complexity \u2014 how can we efficiently answer probabilistic inference queries given a distribution? Finally, we must contend with what we refer to as human task complexity, which is a challenge stemming from the fact that it can be difficult to accurately elicit a full ranking over a large list of candidates from a human user; choosing from a list of n! options is no easy task and users typically prefer to provide partial information. Take the American Psychological Association (APA) elections, for example, which allow their voters to rank order candidates from favorite to least favorite. In the 1980 election, there were five candidates, and therefore 5! = 120 ways to rank those five candidates. Despite the small candidate list, most voters in the election preferred to only specify their top-k favorite candidates rather than writing down full rankings on their ballots (see Figure 1). For example, roughly a third of voters simply wrote down their single favorite candidate in this 1980 election. These three intertwined challenges of storage, algorithmic, and human task complexity are the central issues of probabilistic modeling for rankings, and models that do not efficiently handle all three sources of complexity have limited applicability. In this paper, we examine a flexible and intuitive class of models for rankings based on a generalization of probabilistic independence called riffled independence, proposed in our recent work (Huang & Guestrin, 2009, 2010). While our previous papers have focused primarily on representational (storage complexity) issues, we now concentrate on inference and incomplete observations (i.e., partial rankings), showing that in addition to storage complexity, riffle independence based models can efficiently address issues of algorithmic and human task complexity. In fact the two issues of algorithmic and human task complexity are intricately linked for riffle independent models. By considering partial rankings, we give users more flexibility to provide as much or as little information as they care to give. In the context of partial ranking data, the most relevant inference queries also take the form of partial rankings. For example, we might want to predict a voter\u2019s second choice candidate given information about his first choice. One of our main contributions in this paper is to show that inference for such partial ranking queries can be performed particularly efficiently for riffle independent models. The main contributions of our work are as follows:2 \u2022 We reveal a natural and fundamental connection between riffle independent models and partial rankings. In particular, we show that the collection of partial rankings over an item set form a complete characterization of the space of observations upon 1. Note that it is common to wonder why one would care to represent a distribution over all rankings if the number of sample rankings is never nearly as large. This problem that the number of samples is always much smaller than n! however, means that most rankings are never observed, limiting our ability to estimate the probability of an arbitrary ranking. The only way to overcome the paucity of samples is to exploit representational structure, which is very much in alignment with solving the storage complexity issue. 2.
