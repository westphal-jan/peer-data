Introduction", "text": "Dempster-Shafer theory (D-S theory for short) (Dempster, 1967; Shafer,\n1976) has been widely used because it allows to handle uncertain data (Durbach and Stewart, 2012; Yang et al., 2013; Yang and Xu, 2013). In D-S theory, various belief structures are employed to represent the uncertain data. Recently, the study of parameter estimation based on belief structures has attracted many attentions (Come et al., 2009; Denoeux, 2010, 2013; Su et al., 2013). Typically, Denoeux (Denoeux, 2013) proposed an evidential EM algorithm for parameter estimation in the case of crisp belief structures, and Su et al. (Su et al., 2013) developed a parameter estimation approach for fuzzy belief structures. In this paper, the parameter estimation based on interval-valued belief structures (Yager, 2001; Wang et al., 2006) has been considered. A novel parameter estimation method is proposed for the case of interval-valued belief structures. Within the proposed method, two criteria, the maximization of observation data\u2019s likelihood and the minimization of estimated parameter\u2019s uncertainty, are both considered simultaneously. The proposed method is effective for both crisp (deterministic) and interval-valued (uncertain) belief structures, and promising for various applications."}, {"heading": "2. D-S theory and belief structures", "text": "D-S theory (Dempster, 1967; Shafer, 1976) is often regarded as an extension of the Bayesian theory. Please refer to (Shafer, 1976; Yang and Xu, 2013) for more knowledge about D-S theory. In D-S theory, various belief structures, such as crisp, interval-valued and fuzzy belief structures, are employed as basic data structures. They are used to express various uncertain information. A crisp belief structure is defined as follows.\nDefinition 1. Let a finite nonempty set \u2126 be a frame of discernment, and 2\u2126 denote the power set of \u2126. A crisp belief structure is a mapping m : 2\u2126 \u2192\n[0, 1], satisfying\nm(\u2205) = 0 and \u2211\nA\u22082\u2126\nm(A) = 1 (1)\nThe crisp belief structure is deterministic because its belief degree is expressed by real numbers. By contrast, the interval-valued belief structure (IBS) is a kind of uncertain belief structures, which is an extension of the crisp belief structure. It is more capable to represent the uncertain information. Some basic concepts about IBS are given as below (Yager, 2001; Wang et al., 2006).\nDefinition 2. Let \u2126 be a frame of discernment, F1, F2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, Fn be the n focal elements on \u2126. An IBS mI satisfies such conditions\n1. ai \u2264 mI(Fi) \u2264 bi, where ai, bi \u2208 [0, 1] and i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n; 2. \u2211n\ni=1 ai \u2264 1 and \u2211n i=1 bi \u2265 1;\n3. mI(F ) = 0, \u2200F /\u2208 {F1, F2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Fn}.\nAn IBS is valid if it satisfies \u2211n i=1 ai \u2264 1 and \u2211n i=1 bi \u2265 1.
