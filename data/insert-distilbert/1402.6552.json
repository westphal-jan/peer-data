Objective of GreenPAD project is to maximize the utilization of green energy (wind, solar and biomass) to power the green data centers.\nThis is a challenge as the energy that can be transmitted to the main grid is restricted by the capacity of the transformers. When the combination of the wind energy and conventional energy exceeds the transformer capacity it has to be used locally in order to avoid wastage. This is addressed by running a green data center\nar X\niv :1\n40 2.\n65 52\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\nwhose energy consumption can be controlled as per the green energy availability; as it is not possible to control the energy consumption pattern of the households.\nSpecifically we focus on wind energy for an analysis similar to paper [1]. We start with simple techniques such as finding the correlation between wind energy and weather attributes and use Matlab plots for fine grained analysis. Next we try to find an equation that relates wind energy to weather attributes. This is useful for the cases where there is one or more parameters missing e.g. no wind energy data but weather attributes. The schema of GreenPAD is depicted in Figure 1 ."}, {"heading": "2 Motivation", "text": "We try to use the weather forecast to predict the wind energy by finding the exact relation between wind energy and weather attributes. From the perspective of GreenPAD project, wind energy prediction is critical for scheduling the jobs on the green data center. For example, jobs that have higher energy requirement\ncould be scheduled at times when there is more green energy available and viceversa."}, {"heading": "3 Analysis of Wind energy and Weather data", "text": "November and December show high wind energy availability (which depends upon wind speed) followed by July as seen from Figure 3. During December the wind energy intensities were uniformly distributed i.e. high and low wind speeds were almost equally likely whereas August showed the least variation with wind energy availability being very low (0-1 MW) most of the times and hardly\nexceeding 8 W.\nIn Table 1 wind energy shows a high degree of correlation with wind speed (0.68) and wind direction (0.31). This is followed by Air pressure (0.17) and Precipitation (0.11). Temperature and Sunshine show negative correlation. Negative correlation between solar and wind energy of -.948.\nHigh correlation between wind speed and wind direction in Table 1 is explained by Figure 4 where the winds coming from east (90 degrees) and west (270 degrees) have higher speeds which may corresponds to the high-pressure areas due to low temperatures and winds coming coming from the ocean respectively.\nIn Figure 5 we find wind speed and Wind direction to have the highest correlation with the wind energy. Although the correlation between wind energy and wind speed is obvious we attribute the high correlation with wind direction as high speed winds usually come from specific directions e.g. east to west may be due to winds coming from ocean or formation of other low pressure areas. In the plot between wind energy and days winters show higher wind intensity. In the plot with wind direction the spikes at around 90 and 270 degrees is because the winds coming from east and west have relatively higher intensities when compared to other directions.\nIn the plot with cloud cover there is higher wind speed at times when there is very low or high cloud cover which corresponds to clear sky and intense clouds. In the next plot with sunshine again higher wind speed is observer when there is either higher or lower sunshine. Whereas low sunshine periods correspond to winters, higher sunshine would create a low-pressure area thus increasing the\nwinds blowing inwards towards this area. In the next plot there is higher wind speed when the temperature ranges between around between 0 and 20 degree celsius as compared to other times. Wind speed increases with air pressure as usually higher air pressure seems to resist wind flow. Precipitation shows little correlation with wind speed.\nCloud cover shows higher correlation with wind speed (Figure 6) with higher values of cloud cover corresponding to higher wind speeds. However, higher wind speeds are not observed for partially cloudy condition(cloud cover value of around 0.5). Air pressure (Figure 7) only shows higher correlation with wind speed at lower air pressure values (940-980 HPA) where it is inversely related (wind speeds increase with decrease in air pressure).\nIn Figure 8 (days on x-axis have to interpreted as days mod 365), higher wind energy is observer during December and January. Wind directions seems to shift at regular intervals thus creating a zig-zag shape except during winters where the winds blow exclusively from west possibly due to creation of a low-pressure in the east. Temperature as expected increases during summers and decreases during winters. Sunshine seems to be uniform apart from the period around December where it is educed due to cloudy conditions. Wind energy peaks during winters\nwhich has a direct correlation with wind speed. Precipitation as expected is higher during the rainy seasons during August. Air pressure slowly decreases until winters and then increases. Cloud cover remains uniform throughout year apart from period during February."}, {"heading": "4 Statistical Model for Wind Energy Prediction us-", "text": "ing Weather data\nThe equation for relation of wind energy with weather attributes (using correlation regression) is as follows:\nPredictedWindenergy = \u2212.84 \u2217 Temperature \u2212 .96 \u2217CloudCover \u2212.89 \u2217 AirPressure + .71 \u2217WindS peed \u2212.15 \u2217WindDirection \u2212 .78 \u2217 Precipitation\n\u22121.02 \u2217 S unS hine (1)\nFor deriving equation (1) we use correlation regression.

Using the green energy prediction obtained from the statistical model we are able to precompute job schedules for maximizing the green energy utilization in the future.\nWe find a higher degree of correlation between wind energy and wind direction which indicates that the winds coming from certain directions - east and west had higher intensities. Maximum green energy is available during winters i.e. during the months of December and January."}], "references": [{"title": "Predicting Solar Generation from Weather Forecasts Using Machine Learning", "author": ["Navin Sharma", "Pranshu Sharma", "David Irwin", "Prashant Shenoy"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Cloudy Computing: Leveraging Weather Forecasts in Energy Harvesting Sensor Systems, in SECON", "author": ["N.
