Introduction", "text": "Quantitative handling incomplete, uncertain and imprecise information data warrants the use of soft computing methods [1]. Soft computing methods such as fuzzy set theory [2], rough set [3, 4], Dempster-Shafer evidence theory [5, 6] can essentially provide rational solutions for complex real-world problems. The traditional Bayesian (subjectivist) probability approach cannot differentiate between aleatory and epistemic uncertainties and is unable to handle non-specific, ambiguous and conflicting information without making strong assumptions. These limitations can be partially addressed by the application of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, which was found to be flexible enough to combine the rigor of probability theory with the flexibility of rule-based systems [7, 8]. Due to its efficiency to handle uncertain information, evidence theory is widely used in many applications such as pattern recognition[9], evidential reasoning [10, 11], complex network and systems [12, 13], DS/AHP [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] and other decision making fields [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30].\nHowever, there are some limitations in the classical Dempster-Shafer ev-\nidence theory. One of the well known problems is the conflict management when evidence highly conflicts, which is heavily studied. However, some other issues are paid little attention. For example, the elements in the frame of discernment must be mutually exclusive which has greatly limited its practical application [31, 32]. For example, it is not correct to have a basic probability assignment as m{good} = 0.8, m{good, verygood} = 0.2, since the linguistic variable verygood is not exclusive of the other linguistic variable good.\nRecently, some applications of D numbers to represent uncertain information has been reported, which is an extension of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory [31, 32, 33, 34] . D numbers can effectively represent uncertain information since that the exclusive property of the elements in the frame of discernment is not required, and the completeness constraint is released if necessary. Due to the propositions of applications in the real word could not be strictly mutually exclusive, these two improvements are greatly beneficial. To get a more accurate uncertain data fusion, a discounting of D numbers based on the exclusive degree is necessary. However, some key issues on D numbers are not yet well addressed. For example, it is necessary to develop a reasonable combination rule of D numbers. In addition, similar to the pignistic probability transformation in belief function theory, the transformation of D numbers into linguistic variables to make a final decision is inevitable. To address these issues, the D numbers theory (DNT) is systematically developed in this paper.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2, some preliminaries are briefly introduced. The D numbers theory is presented in Section 3. The\napplication in linguistic decision making is used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed DNT.

There are three main parts of this theory, namely the uncertainty modelling, the combination of D numbers and the decision making based on linguistic variable transformation. These parts are detailed as follows."}, {"heading": "3.1. Definition of D numbers", "text": "In the mathematical framework of Dempster-Shafer theory, the basic probability assignment (BPA) defined on the frame of discernment is used\nto express the uncertainty in judgement. A problem domain indicated by a finite non-empty set \u2126 of mutually exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses is called a frame of discernment. Let 2\u2126 denote the power set of \u2126, a BPA is a mapping m : 2\u2126 \u2192 [0, 1], satisfying\nm(\u2205) = 0 and \u2211\nA\u22082\u2126\nm(A) = 1 (10)\nBPA has an advantage of directly expressing the \u201cuncertainty\u201d by assigning the basic probability number to a subset composed of N objects, rather than to an individual object. Despite this, however, there exists some strong hypotheses and hard constraints on the frame of discernment and BPA, which limit the representation capability of Dempster-Shafer theory regarding the uncertain information. On the one hand, the frame of discernment must be a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive set, i.e., the elements in the frame of discernment are required to be mutually exclusive. This hypothesis however is difficult to be satisfied in many situations. For example some assessments are often expressed by natural language or qualitative ratings such as \u201cGood\u201d, \u201cFair\u201d, \u201cBad\u201d. Due to these assessments base on human judgment, they inevitably contain intersections. Therefore, the exclusiveness hypothesis cannot be guaranteed precisely so that the application of Dempster-Shafer theory is questionable and limited. On the other hand, a normal BPA must be subjected to the completeness constraint, which means that the sum of all focal elements in a BPA must equal to 1. But in many cases, the assessment is only on the basis of partial information so that an incomplete BPA is obtained. Fox example in an open world [43], the in-\ncompleteness of the frame of discernment may lead to the incompleteness of information. Additionally, the Dempster\u2019s rule of combination also cannot handle the incomplete BPAs.\nD numbers [32] is a new representation of uncertain information, which is an extension of Dempster-Shafer theory. It overcomes these existing deficiencies in Dempster-Shafer theory and appears to be more effective in representing various types of uncertainty. D numbers are defined as follows.\nDefinition 9. Let \u2126 be a finite nonempty set, a D number is a mapping formulated by\nD : \u2126 \u2192 [0, 1] (11)\nwith\n\u2211\nB\u2286\u2126\nD(B) \u2264 1 (12)\nwhere B is a subset of \u2126.\nCompared with the definition of BPA in evidence theory, there are two main differences listed below. One, the sum of the D numbers is not necessary to 1. The main reason is that only in the close world can we guarantee that D(\u2205) = 0. The other, \u2205 is an empty set and the following condition is not necessary in D numbers theory since we may be in the open world.\nD(\u2205) = 0 (13)\nHowever, we focus on the situation in close world in this paper. As a result, if we do not specialize to point out, we assume D(\u2205) = 0 which means\nthe close world. We focus on the handling the non-exclusive hypotheses based on D numbers, especially in linguistic environment.\nSuppose there exists a task to assess a project. In the frame of DempsterShafer theory, the frame of discernment is {Good, Fair, Bad}, shown in Figure 2(a). A BPA could be constructed to express the expert\u2019s assessment:\nm({Good}) = 0.2 m({Fair}) = 0.7 m({Fair, Bad}) = 0.1\n(14)\nIf another expert gives his assessment by using D numbers, the problem\ndomain can be shown as Figure 2(b). The assessment is as follows.\nD({Good}) = 0.2 D({Fair}) = 0.6 D({Fair, Bad}) = 0.1\n(15)\nNote that the set of {Good, Fair, Bad} in D numbers is not a frame of discernment, because the elements are not mutually exclusive. In addition, the additive constraint is released in D numbers. In this example D({Good}) +D({Fair}) +D({Fair, Bad}) = 0.9. If \u2211 B\u2286\u2126 D(B) = 1, the in-\nformation is said to be complete; If \u2211 B\u2286\u2126 D(B) < 1, the information is said to be incomplete.\nIf a problem domain is \u2126 = {b1, b2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , bi, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , bn}, where bi \u2208 R and\nbi 6= bj if i 6= j, a special form of D numbers can be expressed by\nD({b1}) = v1 D({b2}) = v2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 D({bi}) = vi \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 D({bn}) = vn\n(16)\nsimple noted for D = {(b1, v1), (b2, v2), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (bi, vi), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (bn, vn)}, where vi > 0 and n\u2211\ni=1\nvi \u2264 1. Some properties of D numbers are introduced as follows.\nProperty 1. Permutation invariability.

Firstly, the given D numbers should be discounted by the exclusive coefficient \u03b5, which can guarantee the elements in the frame of discernment \u2126 to be exclusive.

modeling of uncertain information in real world is still an open issue. Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is one of the most commonly used methods. However, the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory has the assumption that the hypothesis in the framework of discernment is exclusive of each other. This condition can be violated in real applications, especially in linguistic decision making since the linguistic variables are not exclusive of each others essentially. In this paper, a new theory, called as D numbers theory (DNT), is systematically developed to address this issue. The combination rule of two D numbers is presented. An coefficient is defined to measure the exclusive degree among the hypotheses in the framework of discernment. The combination rule of two D numbers is presented. If the exclusive coefficient is one which means that the hypothesis in the framework of discernment is exclusive of each other totally, the D combination is degenerated as the \u2217Corresponding author: Yong Deng, School of Computer and Information Science, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, China.

Finally, a linguistic variables transformation of D numbers is presented to make a decision. A numerical example on linguistic evidential decision making is used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed D numbers theory.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software"}}}
