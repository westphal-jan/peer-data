In BoW representations (also known as Vector Space Models), a document is represented as a vector where each entry is a count (or binary count) of tokens that occurred in the document. Given that some tokens are more informative than others, a common technique is to apply a weighting scheme to give more weight to discriminative tokens and less weight to non-discriminative ones. Term frequency-inverse document frequency (tfidf ) (Salton and McGill, 1983) is an unsupervised weighting technique that is commonly employed. In tf-idf, each token i in document d is assigned the following weight,\nwi,d = tfi,d \u00b7 log N\ndfi (1)\nwhere tfi,d is the number of times token i occurred in document d, N is the number of documents in the corpus, and dfi is the number of documents in which token i occurred.\nMany supervised and unsupervised variants of tf-idf exist (Debole and Sebastiani (2003); Martineau and Finin (2009); Wang and Zhang (2013)). The purpose of this paper is not to perform an exhaustive comparison of existing weighting\nschemes, and hence we do not list them here. Interested readers are directed to Paltoglou and Thelwall (2010) and Deng et al. (2014) for comprehensive reviews of the different schemes.\nIn the present work, we propose a simple but novel supervised method to adjust the term frequency portion in tf-idf by assigning a credibility adjusted score to each token. We find that it outperforms the traditional unsupervised tf-idf weighting scheme on multiple benchmarks. The benchmarks include both snippets and longer documents. We also compare our method against Wang and Manning (2012)\u2019s Naive-Bayes Support Vector Machine (NBSVM), which has achieved state-of-the-art results (or close to it) on many datasets, and find that it performs competitively against NBSVM. We additionally find that the traditional tf-idf performs competitively against other, more sophisticated methods when used with the right scaling and normalization parameters."}, {"heading": "2 The Method", "text": "Consider a binary classification task. Let Ci,k be the count of token i in class k, with k \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. Denote Ci to be the count of token i over both classes, and y(d) to be the class of document d. For each occurrence of token i in the training set, we calculate the following,\ns (j) i =\n{\nCi,1 Ci , if y(d) = 1 Ci,\u22121 Ci , if y(d) = \u22121 (2)\nHere, j is the j-th occurrence of token i. Since there are Ci such occurrences, j indexes from 1 to Ci. We assign a score to token i by,\ns\u0302i = 1\nCi\nCi \u2211\nj=1\ns (j) i (3)\nIntuitively, s\u0302i is the average likelihood of making the correct classification given token i\u2019s occurrence in the document, if i was the only token in\nthe document. In a binary classification case, this reduces to,\ns\u0302i = C2i,1 + C 2 i,\u22121\nC2i (4)\nNote that by construction, the support of s\u0302i is [0.5, 1]."}, {"heading": "2.1 Credibility Adjustment", "text": "Suppose s\u0302i = s\u0302j = 0.75 for two different tokens i and j, but Ci = 5 and Cj = 100. Intuition suggests that s\u0302j is a more credible score than s\u0302i, and that s\u0302i should be shrunk towards the population mean. Let s\u0302 be the (weighted) population mean. That is,\ns\u0302 = \u2211\ni\nCi \u00b7 s\u0302i C\n(5)\nwhere C is the count of all tokens in the corpus. We define credibility adjusted score for token i to be,\nsi = C2i,1 + C 2 i,\u22121 + s\u0302 \u00b7 \u03b3\nC2i + \u03b3 (6)\nwhere \u03b3 is an additive smoothing parameter. If Ci,k\u2019s are small, then si \u2248 s\u0302 (otherwise, si \u2248 s\u0302i). This is a form of Buhlmann credibility adjustment from the actuarial literature (Buhlmann and Gisler, 2005). We subsequently define tf , the credibility adjusted term frequency, to be,\ntf i,d = (0.5 + si) \u00b7 tfi,d (7)\nand tf is replaced with tf .

A word occurring (say) ten times more in a document is unlikely to be ten times as important. Paltoglou and Thelwall (2010) confirm that sublinear scaling of term frequency results in significant improvements in various text classification tasks. We employ logarithmic scaling, where tf is replaced with log(tf) + 1. For our method, tf is simply replaced with log(tf) + 1. We found virtually no difference in performance between log scaling and other sublinear scaling methods (such as augmented scaling, where tf is replaced with 0.5 + 0.5+tfmax tf )."}, {"heading": "2.3 Normalization", "text": "Using normalized features resulted in substantial improvements in performance versus using un-normalized features.

One, they use l2 hinge loss (as opposed to l1 loss in this paper). Two, they interpolate NBSVM weights with Multivariable Naive Bayes (MNB) weights to get the final weight vector. Further, their tokenization is slightly different. Hence our NBSVM results are not directly comparable. We list their results in table 2.\n2https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-reviewdata/.

The standard train-test splits are used on IMDB and Newsgroup datasets.\n4.1 cred-tf-idf outperforms tf-idf\nTable 2 has the comparison of results for the different datasets. Our method outperforms the traditional tf-idf on all benchmarks for both unigrams and bigrams. While some of the differences in performance are significant at the 0.05 level (e.g. IMDB), some are not (e.g. PL-2k). The Wilcoxon signed ranks test is a non-parametric test that is often used in cases where two classifiers are compared over multiple datasets (Demsar, 2006). The Wilcoxon signed ranks test indicates that the overall outperformance is significant at the <0.01 level.\n4.2 NBSVM outperforms cred-tf-idf\ncred-tf-idf did not outperform Wang and Manning (2012)\u2019s NBSVM (Wilcoxon signed ranks test pvalue = 0.1). But it did outperform our own implementation of NBSVM, implying that the extra modifications by Wang and Manning (2012) (i.e. using squared hinge loss in the SVM and interpolating between NBSVM and MNB weights) are important contributions of their methodology. This was especially true in the case of shorter documents, where our uninterpolated NBSVM performed significantly worse than their interpolated NBSVM.\n4.3 tf-idf still performs well\nWe find that tf-idf still performs remarkably well with the right scaling and normalization parameters. Indeed, the traditional tf-idf outperformed many of the more sophisticated methods that employ distributed representations (Maas et al. (2011); Socher et al. (2011)) or other weighting schemes (Martineau and Finin (2009); Deng et al. (2014))."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "In this paper we presented a novel supervised weighting scheme, which we call credibility adjusted term frequency, to perform sentiment analysis and text classification. Our method outperforms the traditional tf-idf weighting scheme on multiple benchmarks, which include both snippets and longer documents. We also showed that tf-idf is competitive against other state-of-the-art methods with the right scaling and normalization parameters.\nFrom a performance standpoint, it would be interesting to see if our method is able to achieve even better results on the above tasks with proper tuning of the \u03b3 parameter. Relatedly, our method could potentially be combined with other supervised variants of tf-idf, either directly or through ensembling, to improve performance further."}], "references": [{"title": "Customizing sentiment classifiers to new domains: A case study", "author": ["A.
