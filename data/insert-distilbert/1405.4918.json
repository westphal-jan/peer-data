INTRODUCTION", "text": "The Internet has become a tremendous world-wide bazaar where massive amounts of information (much of it of dubious quality and value) are being disseminated and consumed on a constant basis. Sharing of multimedia content is one of the major contributors\nto Internet\u2019s growth and popularity. Another prominent source of shared information is textual, e.g., blogs, tweets and various discussion fora. Among those, community reviewing has carved out an important niche. This category includes well-known sites, such as: Yelp, CitySearch, UrbanSpoon, Google Places and TripAdvisor. There are also many others that include customerbased reviewing as a side-bar, e.g., Amazon or Ebay.\nRegardless of their primary mission and subject coverage, community reviewing sites are popular since many are free and contain lots of useful content voluntarily contributed by regular people who document their experience with products, services, destinations, and attractions. Larger sites, e.g., TripAdvisor and Yelp, have tens of millions of users (readers) and millions of contributors [9].\nCertain features distinguish community reviewing sites from other contributory Internet services:\n\u2022 Discussion Fora: these vary from product or topic discussions to comment sections in on-line news media. They are often short and not very informative (even hostile).\n\u2022 Body of Knowledge: the best-known and most popular example is Wikipedia \u2013 a huge amalgamation of communal knowledge on a very wide range of subjects. However, unlike reviewing sites where each review is atomic and discernable, related contributions to body-of-knowledge sites are usually mashed together, thus (by design) obscuring individual prose.\n\u2022 Online Social Networks (OSNs): such sites are essentially free-for-all as far as the type and the amount of contributed information. Since most OSNs restrict access to content provided by a user to \u201cfriends\u201d (or \u201ccolleagues\u201d) of that user, opinions and reviews do not propagate to the rest of Internet users.\nSome recent work [20] has shown that many contributors to community reviewing sites accumulate a body of authored content that is sufficient for creating their stylometric profiles, based on rather simple features (e.g.,\nar X\niv :1\n40 5.\n49 18\nv1 [\ncs .D\nL ]\n1 9\nM ay\n2 01\n4\ndigram frequency). A stylometric profile allows probabilistic linkage among reviews generated by the same person. This could be used to link reviews from different accounts (within a site or across sites) operated by the same user. On one hand, tracking authors of spam reviews can be viewed as a useful service. On the other hand, the ease of highly accurate linkage between different accounts is disconcerting and ultimately detrimental to privacy. Consider, for example, a vindictive merchant who, offended by reviews emanating from one account, attempts to link it to other accounts held by the same person, e.g., for the purpose of harrassment. We consider both sides of this debate to be equally valid and do not choose sides. However, we believe that the privacy argument deserves to be considered, which triggers the motivation for this paper:\nWhat can be done to mitigate linkability of reviews authored by the same contributor?\nRoadmap:. Our goal is to develop techniques that mitigate review account linkability. To assess efficacy of proposed techniques, we need accurate review linkage models. To this end, we first improve state-of-art author review linkage methods. We construct a specific technique, that offers 90% accuracy, even for a small number of identified reviews (e.g., 95) and a smaller set (e.g., 5) of anonymous reviews.\nOur second direction is the exploration of techniques that decrease authorship linkability. We start by considering crowdsourcing, which entails engaging random strangers in rewriting reviews. As it turns out, our experiments using Amazon MTurk [1] clearly demonstrate that authorship linkability can be significantly inhibited by crowdsourced rewriting. Meanwhile, somewhat surprisingly, crowd-rewritten reviews remain meaningful and generally faithful to the originals. We then focus on machine translation tools and show that, by randomly selecting languages to (and from) which to translate, we can substantially decrease linkability.\nOrganization:. The next section summarizes related work. Then, Section 3 overviews some preliminaries, followed by Section 4 which describes the experimental dataset and review selection process for subsequent experiments. Next, Section 5 discusses our linkability study and its outcomes. The centerpiece of the paper is Section 6, which presents crowdsourcing and translation experiments. It is followed by Section 7 where we discuss possible questions associated with the use of crowdsourcing. Finally, summary and future work appear in Section 8."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "Related work generally falls into two categories: Authorship Attribution/Identification and Author Anonymization.\nAuthorship Attribution. There are many studies in the literature. For example, [20] shows that many Yelp\u2019s reviewers are linkable using only very simple feature set. While the setting is similar to ours, there are some notable differences. First, we obtain high linkability using very few reviews per author. Second, we only rely on features extracted from review text. A study of blog posts achieves 80% linkability accuracy [22]. Author identification is also studied in the context of academic paper reviews achieving accuracy of 90% [21]. One major difference between these studies and our work is that we use reviews, which are shorter, less formal and less restrictive in choice of words than blogs and academic papers. Abbasi and Chen propose a well-known author attribution technique based on Karhunen-Loeve transforms to extract a large list of Writeprint features (assessed in Section 5) [10]. Lastly, Stamatatos provides a comprehensive overview of authorship attribution studies [26].\nAuthor Anonymization. There are several wellknown studies in author anonymization [24, 17, 19]. Rao and Rohatgi are among the first to address authorship anonymity by proposing using round-trip machine translation, e.g., English \u2192 Spanish \u2192 English, to obfuscate authors [24]. Other researchers apply round-trip translation, with a maximum of two intermediate languages and show that it does not provide noticeable anonymizing effect [15, 13]. In contrast, we explore effects (on privacy) of increasing and/or randomizing the number of intermediate languages.\nKacmarcik and Gamon show how to anonymize documents via obfuscating writing style, by proposing adjustment to document features to reduce the effectiveness of authorship attribution tools [17]. The main limitation of this technique is that it is only applicable to authors with a fairly large text corpus, whereas, our approach is applicable to authors with limited number of reviews.\nOther practical-counter-measures for authorship recognition techniques such as obfuscation and imitation attacks are explored [14]. However, it is shown that such stylistic deception can be detected with 96.6% accuracy [11].\nThe most recent relevant work is Anonymouth [19] \u2013 a framework that captures the most effective features of documents for linkability and identifies how these feature values should be changed to achieve anonymization. Our main advantage over Anonymouth is usability. Anonymouth requires the author to have two additional sets of documents, on top of the original document to be anonymized: 1) sample documents written\nby the same author and 2) a corpus of sample documents written by other authors. Whereas, our approach does not require any such sets."}, {"heading": "3. BACKGROUND", "text": "This section overviews stylometry, stylometric characteristics and statistical techniques used in our study. Merriam-Webster dictionary defines Stylometry as: the study of the chronology and development of an author\u2019s work based especially on the recurrence of particular turns of expression or trends of thought. We use stylometry in conjunction with the following two tools: Writeprints feature set: well-known stylometric features used to analyze author\u2019s writing style. Chi-Squared test: a technique that computes the dis-\ntance between each author\u2019s review in order to assess linkability."}, {"heading": "3.1 Writeprints", "text": "Writeprints is essentially a combination of static and dynamic stylometric features that capture lexical, syntactic, structural, content and idiosyncratic properties of a given body of text [10]. Some features include:\n\u2022 Average Character Per Word: Total number of characters divided by total number of words.\n\u2022 Top Letter Trigrams: Frequency of contiguous sequence of 3 characters, e.g. aaa, aab, aac, ..., zzy, zzz. There are 17576 (263) possible permutation of letter trigrams in English.\n\u2022 Part of Speech (POS) Tag Bigrams: POS tags are the mapping of words to their syntactic behaviour within sentence, e.g. noun or verb. POS tag bigrams denotes 2 consecutive parts of speech tags. We used Stanford POS Maxent Tagger [27] to label each word with one of 45 possible POS tags.\n\u2022 Function Words: Set of 512 common words, e.g. again, could, himself and etc, used by Koppel et al. in Koppel, 2005.\nWriteprints has been used in several stylometric studies [10, 22, 21]. It has been shown to be an effective means for identifying authors because of its capability to capture even smallest nuances in writing.\nWe use Writeprints implementation from JStylo \u2013 a Java library that includes 22 stylometric features [19]."}, {"heading": "3.2 Chi-Squared Test", "text": "Chi-Squared (CS) test is used to measure the distance between two distributions [25].

LINKABILITY STUDY PARAMETERS", "text": "This section describes the dataset and problem setting for our linkability analysis."}, {"heading": "4.1 Dataset", "text": "We use a large dataset of reviews from Yelp1 with 1, 076, 850 reviews authored by 1, 997 distinct contributors. We select this particular dataset for two reasons:\n1. Large number of authors with widely varying numbers of reviews: average number of reviews per author is 539, with a standard deviation of 354.\n2. Relatively small average review size \u2013 149 words \u2013 which should make linkability analysis more challenging."}, {"heading": "4.2 Problem Setting", "text": "For a given anonymous set of reviews R, we want to link them to a set of identified reviews \u2013 with a known author. The problem becomes challenging when the set of anonymous and identified reviews are relatively small. The exact problem setting is as follows:\nWe first select 40 authors at random. We pick this relatively small number in order to make subsequent crowdsourcing experiments feasible, as described in Section 6. Then, for each author, we randomly shuffle her reviews and select the first N ones. Next, we split the selected reviews into two sets:\n\u2022 First X reviews form the Anonymous Record (AR) set. We experiment with AR sets of varying sizes.\n\u2022 Subsequent (N \u2212X) reviews form the Identified Record (IR) set.\nOur problem is reduced to linking ARs to their corresponding IRs. We set N=100 and we vary X from 1 to 5. This makes our IRs and ARs quite small compared to an average of 539 reviews per author in the dataset. As a result, our linking problem becomes very challenging.\nNext, we attempt to link ARs to their corresponding IRs. More specifically, for each AR, we rank \u2013 in descending order of likelihood \u2013 all possible authors (i.e. IRs). Then, the top-ranked IR (author) represents the most similar IR to the given AR. If the correct author is among top-ranked T IRs, linking model has a hit; otherwise, it has a miss. For a given value of T , we refer 1See: www.yelp.com.\nto the fraction of hits of all ARs (over the total of 40) as Top-T linkability ratio. Our linkability analysis boils down to finding a model that maximizes this linkability ratio for different T and AR sizes. We consider two integer values of T : [1; 4], where 1 denotes a perfect-hit and 4 stands for an almost-hit."}, {"heading": "5. LINKABILITY ANALYSIS", "text": "We first apply a subset of the popular Writeprints feature set2 to convert each AR and IR into a token set. We then use Chi-Square3 to compute distances between those token sets. We now describe our methodology in more detail. Notation and abbreviations are reflected in Table 1."}, {"heading": "5.1 Methodology", "text": "Firstly, we tokenize each AR and IR sets using every feature \u2013 F \u2013 in our set of selected features \u2013 SF \u2013 to obtain a set of tokens FT = {FT1 , FT2 , ..., FTn}, where FTi denotes the i-th token in FT . Then, we compute distributions for all tokens. Next, we use CS model to compute the distance between AR and IR using respective token distributions. Specifically, to link AR with respect to some feature F , we compute CSd between the distribution of tokens in FT for AR and the distribution of tokens in FT for each IR. After that, we sort the distances in ascending order of CSd(IR,AR) values and return the resulting list. First entry corresponds to the IR with the closest distance to AR, i.e., the most likely match. For more generality in our analysis, we repeat this experiment 3 times, randomly picking different AR and IR sets each time. Then, we average out the results. Note that SF is initially empty and we gradually add features to it, as described next.\n2We initially experimented with the Basic-9 feature set, which is known to provide useful information for author identification for less than 10 potential authors [13]. However, its performance was really poor, since we have 40 authors in our smallest set. 3We tried others tests including: Cosine, Euclidean, Manhattan, and Kullback-Leibler Divergence. However, ChiSquared Test outperformed them all."}, {"heading": "5.2 Feature Selection", "text": "We use a general heuristics, a version of greedy hillclimbing algorithm, for feature selection [23]. The idea is to identify most influential features and gradually combine them in SF , until we encounter a high LR.\n5.2.1 WPall As a benchmark, we start with setting feature set SF\nto WPall, which combines all 22 Writeprint features. We compute LR using WPall in CS model with |AR| = 5. Unfortunately, WPall results in low LRs \u2013 only 52.5% in Top-1 and 82.5% in Top-4. We believe that, because of small AR set, combination of many features increases noise, which, in turn, lowers linkability.\n5.2.2 Improving WPall Next, we use each feature from WPall individually.\nThat is, we try each WPi (for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 22) with |AR| = 5. Table 2 shows the best five features together with WPall after ranking LRs in Top-1 and Top-4. First five features perform significantly better than all others, especially, better than WPall which wound up in 9- th place. Interestingly, LR increases drastically \u2013 from 52.5% to 91% in Top-1 \u2013 with the best feature. Since Top Letter Trigrams performs best individually, we add it to SF . Then we move on to considering combination of other four features with Top Letter Trigrams.\n5.2.3 Improving Top Letter Trigrams Next, we try combining each feature from the set\n{POS Bigrams, Top Letter Bigrams, Words, POS Tags} with SF to check whether it produces a higher LR. It turns out that combining POS Bigrams yields the best LR gain: from 91% to 96% in Top-1, and 96% to 100% in Top-4. Since we achieve 100% LR in Top-4, we set SF as {Top Letter Trigrams, POS Bigrams}.\nWe present LR comparisons of experimented features with varying AR sizes in Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b). For all AR sizes, we notice a significant improvement with Top Letter Trigrams over Writeprints, and similarly with {Top Letter Trigrams, POS Bigrams} over only Top Letter Trigrams in both Top-1 and Top-4.\n5.3 Scalability of the Linkability Technique\nSo far, we assessed linkability of 40 authors only in a set of 40 possible authors. This is partly because computation of WPall in bigger author sets is very expensive. However, 40 is a really small size in a real-world scenario. Therefore, we need to verify that high LRs we found with SF would hold even with larger number of possible authors. For this purpose, we vary author set from 40 to 1000. In particular, we experiment with a set of [40, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000] authors. In each experiment, we assess the linkability of our 40 authors when mixing them with other authors.\nFigure 1(c) shows Top-1 and Top-4 LR of SF with |AR| = 5. Our preferred selection of features \u2013 Top Letter Trigram and POS Bigrams \u2013 achieves high linkability, 77.5% in Top-1 and 90% in Top-4, even in a set of 1000 possible authors."}, {"heading": "5.4 Summary", "text": "To summarize, our main results are as follows:\n1. We started with a well-known Writeprints feature set and achieved modest LRs of up to 52.5% in\nTop-1 and 82.5% in Top-4 using the CS model. (See Section 5.2.1)\n2. We then tried each Writeprint feature individually with the intuition that the combination of multiple features would have more noise, thus decreasing linkability. Surprisingly, using only Top Letter Trigrams or POS Bigrams, we achieved significantly better LR than all Writeprints features. (See Section 5.2.2)\n3. Next, we selected Top Letter Trigrams, which yields 91% and 96% LR in Top-1 and Top-4, as our rising main. Then, we increased linkability to 96% in Top-1, and 100% in Top-4 by adding POS Bigrams. (See Section 5.2.3)\n4. Even when assessing linkability within a large number of possible authors sets, the preferred combination of features maintains high LR, e.g. 77.5% in Top-1 and 90% in Top-4 among 1000 possible authors (See Section 5.3). Thus, we end up setting SF as {Top Letter Trigrams, POS Bigrams},\nwhich will be used for evaluation of anonymization techniques."}, {"heading": "6. FIGHTING AUTHORSHIP LINKABILITY", "text": "We now move on to the main goal of this paper: exploration of techniques that mitigate authorship linkability. We consider two general approaches:\n1. Crowdsourcing: described in Section 6.1.\n2. Machine Translation: described in Section 6.2."}, {"heading": "6.1 Crowdsourcing to the Rescue", "text": "We begin by considering what it might take, in principle, to anonymize reviews. Ideally, an anonymized review would exhibit stylometric features that are not linkable, with high accuracy, to any other review or a set thereof. At the same time, an anonymized review must be as meaningful as the original review and must remain faithful or \u201ccongruent\u201d to it. (We will come back to this issue later in the paper). We believe that such perfect anonymization is probably impossible. This is because stylometry is not the only means of linking reviews. For example, if a TripAdvisor contributor travels exclusively to Antarctica and her reviews cover only specialized cruise-ship lines and related products (e.g., arctic-quality clothes), then no anonymization technique can prevent linkability by topic without grossly distorting the original review. Similarly, temporal aspects of reviews might aid linkability4. Therefore, we do not strive for perfect anonymization and instead confine the problem to the more manageable scope of reducing stylometric linkability. We believe that this degree of anonymization can be achieved by rewriting.\n6.1.1 How to Rewrite Reviews? There are many ways of rewriting reviews in order to\nreduce stylometric linkability. One intuitive approach is to construct a piece of software, e.g., a browser plugin, that alerts the author about highly linkable features in the prospective review. This could be done in real time, as the review is being written, similarly to a spellchecker running in the background. Alternatively, the same check can be done once the review is fully written. The software might even proactively recommend some changes, e.g., suggest synonyms, and partition long, or join short, sentences. In general, this might be a viable and effective approach. However, we do not pursue it in this paper, partly because of software complexity and partly due to the difficulty of conducting sufficient experiments needed to evaluate it.\nOur approach is based on a hypothesis that the enormous power of global crowd-sourcing can be leveraged\n4Here we mean time expressed (or referred to) within a review, not only time of posting of a review.\nto efficiently rewrite large numbers of reviews, such that:\n(1) Stylometric authorship linkability is appreciably reduced, and\n(2) Resulting reviews remain sensible and faithful to the originals.\nThe rest of this section overviews crowdsourcing, describes our experimental setup and reports on the results.\n6.1.2 Crowdsourcing Definition: according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, Crowdsourcing is defined as: the practice of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people, and especially from an online community, rather than from traditional employees or suppliers.\nThere are numerous crowdsourcing services ranging in size, scope and popularity. Some are very topical, such as kickstarter (creative idea/project funding) or microworkers (web site promotion), while others are fairly general, e.g., taskrabbit (off-line jobs) or clickworker (on-line tasks).\nWe selected the most popular and the largest general crowdsourcing service \u2013 Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) [1]. This choice was made for several reasons:\n\u2022 We checked the types of on-going tasks in various general crowdsourcing services and MTurk was the only one where we encountered numerous on-going text rewriting tasks.\n\u2022 We need solid API support in order to publish numerous rewriting tasks. We also need a stable and intuitive web interface, so that the crowdsourcing service can be easily used. Fortunately, MTurk has both a user-friendly web interface for isolated users and API support to automate a larger number of tasks.\n\u2022 Some recent research efforts have used MTurk for the purpose of similar studies [28, 16, 18].\nIn general, we need crowdsourcing for two phases: (1) rewrite original reviews, and (2) conduct a readability and faithfulness evaluation between original and rewritten reviews. More than 400 random MTurkers participated in both phases.\n6.1.3 Rewriting Phase Out of 3 randomly created AR and IR review sets we\nused in Section 5, we randomly selected one as the target for anonymization experiments. We then uploaded all reviews in this AR set to the crowdsourcing service and asked MTurkers to rewrite them using their own words. We asked 5 MTurkers to rewrite each review, in order to obtain more comprehensive and randomized\ndata for the subsequent linkability study. While rewriting, we explicitly instructed participants to keep the meaning similar and not to change proper names from the original review. Moreover, we checked whether the number of words in each new review is close to that of the original before accepting a rewritten submission. Divergent rewrites were rejected5.\nWe published reviews on a weekly basis in order to vary the speed of gathering rewrites. Interestingly, most tasks were completed during the first 3 days of week, and the remaining 4 days were spent reviewing submissions. We finished the rewriting phase in 4 months. Given 40 authors and AR size of 5 (200 total original reviews), each review was rewritten by 5 MTurkers, resulting in 1, 000 total submissions. Of these, we accepted 882. The rest were too short or too long, not meaningful, not faithful enough, or too similar, to the original. Moreover, out of 200 originals, 139 were rewritten 5 times. All original and rewritten reviews can be found at our publically shared folder [7].\nWe paid US$0.12, on average, for each rewriting task. Ideally, a crowdsourcing-based review rewriting system would be free, with peer reviewers writing their own reviews and helping to re-writing others. However, since there was no such luxury at our disposal, we decided to settle on a low-cost approach6. Initially, we offered to pay US$0.10 per rewritten review. However, because review size ranges between 2 and 892 words, we came up with a sliding-price formula: $0.10 for every 250 words or a fraction thereof, e.g., a 490-word review pays $0.20 while a 180-word one pays $0.10. In addition, Amazon MTurk charges a 10% fee for each task.\nOne of our secondary goals was assessment of efficacy and usability of the crowdsourcing service itself. We published one set of 40 reviews via the user interface on the MTurk website, and the second set of 160 reviews \u2013 using MTurk API. We found both means to be practical, error-free and easy to use. Overall, anyone capable of using a web browser can easily publish their reviews on MTurk for rewriting.\nAfter completing the rewriting phase, we continued with a readability study to assess sensibility of rewritten reviews and their correspondence to the originals.\n6.1.4 Readability Study Readability study proceeded as follows: First, we\npick, at random, 100 reviews from 200 reviews in the AR set. Then, for each review, we randomly select one rewritten version. Next, for every [original,rewritten] review-pair, we publish a readability task on MTurk. In those tasks, we ask two distinct MTurkers to score\n5A sample rewriting task and its submission are shown in the Appendix of this paper\u2019s extended draft [4]. 6We consider the average of US$0.12 to be very low per review cost.\nrewritten reviews by comparing its similarity and sensibility to the original one. We define the scores as Poor(1), Fair(2), Average(3), Good(4), Excellent(5), where Poor means that the two reviews are completely different, and Excellent means they are essentially the same meaning-wise. We also ask MTurkers to write a comprehensive result which explains the differences (if any) between original and rewritten counterparts7.\nThis study took one week and yielded 142 valid submissions. Results are reflected in Figure 3. The average readability score turns out to be 4.29/5, while 87% of reviews are given scores of Good or Excellent. This shows that rewritten reviews generally retain the meaning of the originals. Next, we proceed to re-assess stylometric linkability of rewritten reviews.\n6.1.5 Linkability of Rewritten Reviews Recall that the study in Section 5 involved 3 review\nsets each with 100 reviews per author. For the present study, we only consider the first set since we published anonymous reviews from first set to MTurk. In this first set, we replace AR with the corresponding set of MTurk-rewritten reviews where we pick a random rewritten version of each review, while each author\u2019s IR remains the same.\nFigures 2(a) and 2(b) compare LRs between originalrewritten reviews with varying number of authors. Interestingly, we notice a substantial decrease in LRs for all author sizes. For |AR| = 5 in a set of 1000 authors, Top-1 and Top-4 LR drop from 77.5% to 10% and from 90% to 32.5% respectively. Even only in 40 authors set, Top-1 LR decreases to 55%, which is significantly lower than 95% achieved with original reviews.\nWe also present a detailed comparison of original and rewritten reviews\u2019 LRs with different AR sizes in Figures 2(c) and 2(d). Notably, both Top-1 and Top-4 LR decrease dramatically for all AR sizes. 35% is the highest LR obtained with rewritten reviews, which is substantially less than those achieved with original coun-"}, {"heading": "7A sample readability study task and its submission are pre-", "text": "sented in the Appendix of this paper\u2019s extended draft [4].\nterparts. After experiencing this significant decrease in linkability, we analyze rewritten reviews to see what might have helped increase anonymity. We notice that most MTurkers do not change the skeleton of original review. Instead, they change the structure of individual sentences by modifying the order of subject, noun and verb, converting an active sentence into a passive one, or vice versa. We also observe that MTurkers swap words with synonyms. We believe that these findings can be combined into an automated tool, which can help authors rewrite their own reviews. This is one of the items for future work, discussed in more detail in Section 7.\n6.1.6 Crowdsourcing Summary We now summarize key findings from the crowdsourc-\ning experiment.\n1. MTurk based crowdsourcing yielded rewritten reviews that were:\nLow-cost \u2013 we paid only $0.12 including 10% service fee for rewriting each 250-word review.\nFast \u2013 we received submissions within 3-4 days, on average. Easy-to-use \u2013 based on experiences with both user-interface and API of MTurk, an average person who is comfortable using a browser, Facebook or Yelp can easily publish reviews to MTurk.\n2. As the readability study shows, crowdsourcing produces meaningful results: rewrites remain faithful to originals. (See Section 6.1.4).\n3. Most importantly, rewrites substantially reduce linkability. For an |AR| = 5 where we previously witnessed the highest LR, Top-1 LR shrunk from 95% to 55% in a set of 40 authors and from 77.5% to 10% in a set of 1000 authors. (See Section 6.1.5)."}, {"heading": "6.2 Translation Experiments", "text": "We now discuss an alternative approach that uses on-line translation to mitigate linkability discussed in Section 5. The goal is to assess the efficacy of translation for stylometric obfuscation and check whether,\nin combination with crowdsourcing, it can be blended into a single socio-technological linkability mitigation technique.\nIt is both natural and intuitive to consider machine (automated, on-line) translation for obfuscating stylometric features of reviews. One well-known technique is to incrementally translate the text into a sequence of languages and then translate back to the original language. For example, translating a review from (and to) English using three levels of translation (two intermediate languages) could be done as follows: English \u2192 German \u2192 Japanese \u2192 English. The main intuition is to use the on-line translator as an external re-writer, so that stylometric characteristics would change as the translator introduces its own characteristics.\nUsing a translator to anonymize writing style has been attempted in prior work [13, 15]. However, prior studies did not go beyond three levels of translation and did not show significant decreases in linkability. Also, it was shown that that translation often yields nonsensical results, quite divergent from the original text [13]. Due to recent advances in this area, we revisit and reexamine the use of translation. Specifically, we explore effects of the number of intermediate languages on linkability and assess readability of translated outputs. In the process, we discover that translators are actually effective in mitigating linkability, while readability is (though not great) is reasonable and can be easily fixed by crowdsourcing.\n6.2.1 Translation Framework We begin by building a translation framework to per-\nform a large number of translations using any number of languages. Currently, Google [5] and Bing [2] offer the most popular machine translation services. Both use statistical machine translation techniques to dynamically translate text between thousands of language pairs. Therefore, given the same text, they usually return a different translated version. Even though there are no significant differences between them, we decided to use Google Translator. It supports more languages: 64 at the time of this writing [6], while Bing supports 41 [3]).\nGoogle provides a translation API as a free service to researchers with a daily character quota, which can be increased upon request. The API provides the following two functions: \u2022 translate(text, sourceLanguage, targetLanguage):\nTranslates given text from source language to target language. \u2022 languages(): Returns the set of source and target\nlanguages supported in the translate function. Using these functions, we implement the algorithm, shown in Algorithm 1. We first select N languages at random. Then, we consecutively translate text into each of the\nlanguages, one after the other. At the end, we translate the result to its original language, English, in our case. We consider the final translated review as the anonymized version of the original.\nWe also could have used a fixed list of destination languages. However, it is easy to see that translated reviews might then retain some stylometric features of the original (This is somewhat analogous to deterministic encryption.). Thus, we randomize the list of languages hoping that it would make it improbable to retain stylometric patterns. For example, since Google translator supports 64 languages, we have more than N\u22121\u220f n=0 (64\u2212n) \u2248 253 distinct lists of languages for N = 9.\nAlgorithm 1 Round-Translation of Review with N random languages\nObtain all supported languages via languages() RandomLanguages\u2190 select N languages randomly\nSource\u2190 \u201cEnglish\u201d for Language language in RandomLanguages do Review \u2190 translate(Review, Source, language) Source\u2190 language end for Translated\u2190 translate(Review, Source, \u201cEnglish\u201d)\nreturn Translated\nAfter implementing the translation framework, we proceed to assessing linkability of the results.\n6.2.2 Linkability of Translated Reviews Using Algorithm 1, we anonymized the AR review\nset8. We varied N from 1 to 9 and re-ran linkability analysis with translated reviews as the AR. In doing so, we used SF identified in Section 5. To assert generality of linkability of translated texts, we performed the above procedure 3 times, each time with a different list of random languages and then ran linkability analysis 3 times as well. Average linkability results of all 3 runs are plotted in Figures 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c).\nFor the number of intermediate languages, our intuition is that increasing the number of levels of translation (i.e., intermediate languages) causes greater changes in stylometric characteristics of original text. Interestingly, Figure 4(c) supports this intuition: larger N values yield larger decreases of linkability. While the decrease is not significant in Top-4 for N : [1, 2], it becomes more noticeable after 3 languages. For |AR| = 5, we have Top-1 & Top-4 linkabilities of 42.5% & 59% with 4 languages, 31% & 47% with 7 languages and 25% &\n8Translated example reviews are shown in the Appendix of this paper\u2019s extended draft [4].\n40% with 9 languages, respectively. These are considerably lower than 77.5% & 90% achieved with original ARs. Because Top-1 linkability decreases to 25% after 9 languages, we stop increasing N and settle on 9.\nFigures 4(a) and 4(b) show reduction in Top-1 and Top-4 linkability for varying AR sizes. In all of them, original reviews have higher LRs than ones translated with 4 languages; which in turn have higher LRs than those translated with 9 languages. This clearly demonstrates that when more translations are done, the more translator manipulates the stylometric characteristics of a review.\n6.2.3 Readability of Translated Reviews So far, we analyzed the impact of using on-line trans-\nlation on decreasing stylometric linkability. However, we need to make sure that the final result is readable. To this end, we conducted a readability study. We randomly selected a sample of translated reviews for N = 9. We have 3 sets of translated reviews, each corresponding to a random selection of 9 languages. From each set, we randomly selected 20 translated reviews,\nwhich totals up to 60 translated reviews. Then, for each [original, translated] review-pair, we published readability tasks on MTurk (as in Section 6.1.4) and had it assessed by 2 distinct MTurkers, resulting in 120 total submissions.\nResults are shown in Figure 5. As expected, results are not as good as those in Section 6.1.4. However, a number of reviews preserve the original meaning to some extent. The average score is 2.85 out of 5 and most scores were at least \u201cFair\u201d.\n6.2.4 Fixing the Translated Reviews Even though machine translation is continuously get-\nting better at producing readable output, the state-ofthe-art is far from ideal. After manually reviewing some [original, translated] pairs, we realized that most translated reviews retained the main idea of the original. However, because of: (1) frequently weird translation of proper nouns, (2) mis-organization of sentences, and (3) failure of translating terms not in the dictionary, translated review are not easy to read. We decided to provide translated reviews along with their original versions to MTurkers and asked them to fix unreadable parts9. As a task, this is easier and less time-consuming than rewriting the entire review.\nOut of 3 translated review sets, we selected one at random and published all 200 (|AR| = 5 for 40 authors) translated reviews from our AR set to MTurk. We received 189 submissions; only 31 authors had their full AR\u2019s translated reviews completely fixed. We then performed the same linkability assessment with these 31 authors while we update their AR\u2019s by translated-fixed reviews.\nComparison of linkability ratios between original, translated, and fixed version of the same translated reviews is plotted in Figure 6(a). It demonstrates that, fixing translations does not significantly influence linkability. In AR-5, Top-1 linkability of fixed translation is 19% while non-fixed translations 25%. Meanwhile, both are significantly lower than 74% LR of original counterparts.\nFinally, we perform a readability study on fixed translations. Out of 189 submissions, we select 20 randomly and publish to MTurk as a readability task. Average readability score increased from 2.85 to 4.12 after fixing the machine translation. Detailed comparison of readability studies between translated and translated-fixed reviews is given in Figure 7. We notice high percentage of translated reviews has Average score, while fixed counterparts mostly score as Good or Excellent. Results\n9A sample translation-fix task and its submission are presented in the Appendix of this paper\u2019s extended draft [4].\nare really promising since they show that the meaning of a machine translated review can be fixed while keeping it unlinkable.\n6.2.5 Comparison of Anonymization Techniques We present the comparison of linkability results achieved\nusing crowdsourcing, machine translation and combination of both in Figure 6(b). Regardless of the size of author set, we achieve substantial decrease in linkability. Our techniques show that people are good at rewriting and correcting reviews while introducing their own style, keeping the meaning similar, and, most importantly, reducing linkability. While purely rewritten reviews have the lowest linkability, both translated and translated-fixed reviews perform comparable to each other. As far as readability, crowdsourcing (mean score of 4.29/5) performed much better than translation (mean score of 2.85/5). However, results show that low readability scores can be fixed (resulting in a mean score of 4.12/5) using crowdsourcing while keeping linkability low. We summarize results as follows: \u2022 Crowdsourcing: Achieves better anonymity and\nreadability. However, it takes longer than translation since it is not an automated solution. Moreover, though not expensive, it is clearly not free. \u2022 Machine Translation: Completely automated and\ncost-free approach which takes less time than crowdsourcing. However, poor readability is the main disadvantage."}, {"heading": "7. DISCUSSION", "text": "In spite of its usefulness in decreasing linkability and enhancing readability, there are some open questions associated with the use of crowdsourcing.\n1. How applicable is crowdsourcing to other OSNs? In some other OSNs penalties for deanonymization would be higher than Yelp. However we chose\nYelp dataset for the reasons given in Section 4.1. The same technique can be presumably applied to other settings, e.g., anonymous activist blogs, tweets in Twitter and TripAdvisor reviews.\n2. How might authors get their reviews rewritten? This could be addressed by integrating a plug-in into a browser. When an author visits an OSN and writes a review, this plug-in can ease posting of a task to a crowdsourcing platform and return the result back to the author via one-time or temporary email address. On the system side, plug-in would create a rewriting task and relay it to the crowdsourcing system. A possible building block can be the recent work in [12] that proposes a crowdsourcing task automation system. It automates task scheduling, pricing and quality control, and allows tasks to be incorporated into the system as a function call.\n3. How feasible is crowdsourcing in terms of latency and cost? We believe that a delay of couple of days would not pose an inconvenience since review posting does not need to occur in real time. Many popular OSNs does not publish reviews instantly, e.g., TripAdvisor screens each review to make sure it meets certain guidelines. This moderation can take as long as several weeks [8].\nAs far as costs, we paid US$0.12, on average for each rewriting task. We consider this amount is extremely low which can be easily subsidized by the advertizing revenue, with ads in the plug-in.\n4. Is there a privacy risk in posting reviews to strangers? It is difficult to assess whether there is a privacy risk since an adversary does not learn both posted and rewritten reviews, unless she is registered as a worker, completes the task, and her submission gets published. However, this clearly\ndoes not scale for the adversary when the number of posted reviews is large and requires manual follow-up with the posts. Also, MTurk Participation Agreement10 involves conditions that protect privacy of both worker and requester.\n5. Is there a chance of having a rewriter\u2019s writing style recognized? We believe that this is not the case. First, there are many workers to choose from and we can force the system not to select the same worker more than a specific number of times. Second, we expect that a worker would rewrite many reviews from different sources. This will widen the range of topics that rewritten reviews would cover and would make rewritten reviews more difficult to recognize. Finally, the identities of workers are expected to remain private since the only party who can see worker details for a given task is the person who posted it."}, {"heading": "8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "This paper investigated authorship linkability in community reviewing and explored some means of mitigating it. First, we showed, via a linkability study using a proper subset of the Writeprints feature set, that authorship linkability is higher than previously reported. Then, using the power of global crowdsourcing on the Amazon MTurk platform, we published reviews and asked random strangers to rewrite them for a nominal fee. After that, we conducted a readability study showing that rewritten reviews are meaningful and remain similar to the originals. Then, we re-assessed linkability of rewritten reviews and discovered that it decreases substantially. Next, we considered using translation to rewrite reviews and showed that linkability decreases while number of intermediary languages increases. Af-\n10https://www.mturk.com/mturk/conditionsofuse\nter that, we evaluated readability of translated reviews, and realized that on-line translation does not yield results as readable as those from rewritings. Next, we take advantage of crowdsourcing to fix poorly readable translations and still achieve low linkability.\nThis line of work is far from being complete and many issues remain for future consideration: \u2022 We need to explore detailed and sophisticated eval-\nuation techniques in order to understand stylometric differences between original, rewritten and translated reviews. If this succeeds, more practical recommendations can be given to review authors. \u2022 As discussed in Section 7, we want to parlay the\nresults of our study into a piece of software or a plug-in intended for authors. \u2022 We need to conduct the same kind of study in the\ncontext of review sites other than Yelp, e.g., Amazon, TripAdvisor or Ebay. Also, cross-site studies should be undertaken, e.g., using a combination of Amazon and Yelp reviews."}, {"heading": "9. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] Amazon Mechanical Turk. https://www.mturk.com/mturk/.
