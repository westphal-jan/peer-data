INTRODUCTION:", "text": "Set theory as a branch of human endeavour was developed by the efforts of many mathematicians [ Kam ]. Such a theory found many applications in science, technology and other fields. In an effort to capture uncertainity in human reasoning, Zadeh formulated and studied the theory of fuzzy sets. The theory of fuzzy sets found applications in many branches of science and technology. Pawlak, a computer scientist proposed and studied the concept of rough set in an effort to capture other aspects of uncertainity arising in applications such as database design. The theory of rough sets is found to have complemented the theory of fuzzy sets.\nThe author, in his research efforts related\nto the fusion problem in Wireless Sensor Networks ( WSN ) discovered the idea of \u201cgraded set\u201d ( discussed in Section 2 ) as a generalization of the idea of rough set. When understanding the details of rough set theory, the author discovered the idea of \u201cgranular set\u201d. The basic motivation for such sets is discussed below. Motivation for Granular Sets:\nIn biological systems such as trees, when the tissue\nis examined under a microscope at different resolutions, different cells/parts are observed. It is very clear that as the resolution increases, finer granular structure is observed. Our goal is to arrive at a mathematical abstraction of such sets observed in biological systems ( physical, chemical, biological etc ) as well as artificial systems ( such as databases ).

It is clear that the end points c, d depend on the number of faulty intervals ( from say sensors ).\n We are interested in understanding how graded sets naturally arise when the number of faulty intervals ( from sensors ) is varied from a smallest to largest value.\nSpecifically, let \ud835\udc53 \u2208 { \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b , \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b + 1, \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b + 2, \u2026 . , \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 }.

E. D+\nRemark 1: It should be noted that with X ( the set of all objects ) as the target set and \u201cP\u201d being chosen as one of the various possible graded sets, the associated collection of equivalence classes constitute a granular set.\nRemark 2: The above discussion points to the fact that in any \u201chierarchical classification\u201d effort ( as in the case of information table based classification in data bases ), the set that naturally arises is a \u201cgranular set\u201d.\n Generalization of Rough Set Concepts: Graded Sets: We now reason that,\ngraded sets arise as a natural generalization of rough sets in classification problem.\nFrom the rough set theory, we have that the target set X can be\napproximated using only the information contained within P by constructing the P-lower ( denoted by P X ) and P-upper approximation ( denoted by \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc4b ) of X:\nP X = { x | [x]\ud835\udc43 is a subset of X }\n\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc4b = \ud835\udc65 [\ud835\udc65 ]\ud835\udc43 \u2229 \ud835\udc4b \u2260 \u2205 } . Now we are interested in understanding what happens if the target set , \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 is varied in the following manner i.e.\n\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56+1 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f 1 \u2264 \ud835\udc56 \u2264 (\ud835\udc3f \u2212 1) .\ni.e. \ud835\udc4c = [ \ud835\udc4b1 \u2236 \ud835\udc4b2 \u2236 \u2026 . \u2236 \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc3f ] is a graded set. From the above definitions of lower and upper approximations of P, it is clear that\nP \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 is a subset of P \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56+1 for 1 \u2264 \ud835\udc56 \u2264 (\ud835\udc3f \u2212 1) and that\n\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 is a subset of \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56+1 for 1 \u2264 \ud835\udc56 \u2264 (\ud835\udc3f \u2212 1) .\nThus, we necessarily have that the lower and upper approximations constitute \u201cgraded sets\u201d when the target set constitutes a graded set.\n Generalization of Information System: We conceive of an information\nsystem which is represented by a three dimensional array ( and not a 2- dimensional matrix as given in the above example ). Thus the 3-dimensional array corresponds to \u201cobjects/patterns\u201d versus \u201cvarious sets of features\u201d. The feature sets could be dependent on one another. Thus, we have a collection of \u201cinformation tables\u201d, that are all captured in a three-dimensional information array."}, {"heading": "4.
