INTRODUCTION\nConsistency level along with consensus degree have a vital role in the decision making process. Optimization technique deals with selecting the best possible alternatives among a set of feasible alternatives. Optimization of CCL level is mandatory in order to achieve a quality decision. GDM process consists of a team of decision makers who provide their preferences over a set of alternatives. Multiplicative preference relation and fuzzy preference relation are two main types of preferences relations. Saaty [1] in 1980 and Wang and Xu [2] in 1990 introduced multiplicative preference relation which was defined as a reciprocal matrix. In 1978, Orlovsky [3] proposed FPR using complementary matrix to show an expert\u2019s opinion in decision making process. Chiclana et al. [4, 5] used reciprocal relations as uniform preference to present preference orderings and explored fuzzy multipurpose decision making problems. Herrera-Viedma et al. [6-8] proposed some GDM models using incomplete FPRs. Das et al. [12] have proposed a decision making procedure using FPR. Recently, a number of research works [13-22] have been published on decision making using soft computing techniques.\nThe aim of this article is to optimize the CCL level of FPR using SA [9] to achieve improved GDM process. Consensus degree measurement is used to evaluate the degree of agreement of all experts and a consistency level measurement is used to identify the quality intensity of each expert\u2019s opinion. To calculate the CCL, initially all missing values of all the incomplete FPRs are estimated using consistency based estimation procedure [8]. Then the consistency measure of each expert is computed and a\nglobal consistency level is measured. The method proposed by Herrera-Videma [7] has been used to compute the consensus degree of all the experts. The application of SA allows achieving consistent solutions with a high consensus degree without the intervention of any moderator. Fig. 1 shows the use of SA for GDM. This article is organized as follows: Section II describes the various used methodologies. Simulated annealing algorithm is presented in section III. Numerical illustration is done in section IV followed by conclusion in section V.\nII. METHODOLOGY"}, {"heading": "A.

SIMULATED ANNEALING\nA. Introduction\nSA was introduced by Kirkpatrick [9] in 1983, inspired by annealing process in physics. The idea behind simulated annealing is based on the fact that a material is being heated and then slowly cooled down in a controlled manner, the mobility due to temperature of its particles is lost, and these particles reach a crystal structure along the solidification. The crystal state is the minimum energy free\nstate of the system. The key of the process is the slow cooling, which allows a wide range of time for redistribution of the particles as they lose mobility. SA has proven to be a good technique to find solutions near the optimum (if not the optimum) within a reasonable computation time. Simulated annealing is a stochastic search method based on the use of a local search. Local search iteratively replaces the current solution s by a new one s* until some stopping condition has been satisfied. The new solution which is termed as neighbor solution is created usually by a single move. The quality of the solution is characterized by its cost determined by a cost function. The goal of the search process is to minimize the cost function. But for SA, at any step, it either moves to a better neighbor solution if it finds one or to a worse solution with a certain probability. It includes the worse solution with an expectation that in near future it might be able to produce some better solutions."}, {"heading": "B.

problems fuzzy preference relations (FPR) are widely used for representing decision makers\u2019 opinions on the set of alternatives. In order to avoid misleading solutions, the study of consistency and consensus has become a very important aspect. This article presents a simulated annealing (SA) based soft computing approach to optimize the consistency/consensus level (CCL) of a complete fuzzy preference relation in order to solve a GDM problem. Consistency level indicates an expert\u2019s preference quality and consensus level measures the degree of agreement among experts\u2019 opinions. This study also suggests the set of experts for the necessary modifications in their prescribed preference structures without intervention of any moderator.", "creator": null}}}
