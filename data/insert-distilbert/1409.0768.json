INTRODUCTION\nNegative side effects caused by prescribed medication currently present a huge burden for the healthcare service in terms of causing both patient morbidity or mortality and costing large sums of money [1] [2] [3]. Investigations have shown that the rate of unwanted side effects has been increasing annually [4] [5]. Possible reasons for this are an increase in the number of annual prescriptions due to an aging population or an increase in polypharmacy, when numerous drugs are prescribed at the same time [6]. Although it is common for a patient to develop side effects due to prescribed medication there is currently no efficient means of identifying all the side effects of a drug. When the side effect is detrimental to the patient\u2019s quality of life, it is often referred to as an Adverse Drug Event (ADE) and when the drug causing the ADE is known, it is termed an Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR). A study conducted in the UK between November 2001 to April 2002 indicated that 6.5% of admissions to hospital were due to ADRs, with the mortality rate for an ADR patient of 2.3% [7]. Interestingly, it was found that over 70% of these ADRs were potentially avoidable. A more recent study in Brazil suggests ADRs may be the cause of an even higher proportion of hospital admissions for the elderly as it showed that ADRs were the cause of hospitalisation for over 50% of elderly patients [8]. It also highlighted that a significant factor for developing an ADR was polypharmacy [8], when patients are prescribed multiple drugs.\nSome obvious ADRs can be discovered during the experimental stages of a drug\u2019s development, but the occurrence of an ADR can depend on a magnitude of factors and it is impossible to investigate all the possible situations that may occur when the drug is taken. For example, testing for ADRs that result from polypharmacy would require clinical trials with millions of people to be able to investigate all the different drug combinations and this is not possible. Due to the limitations of clinical trials, rare ADRs, including fatal ones, are in most circumstances not discovered before a drug is marketed [9] [10]. As a consequence, after a drug is approved and available to patients, possible ADRs are investigated during the whole lifetime of a drug by a process known as post-marketing drug surveillance.\nPost-marketing surveillance (such as doctors being vigilant and noticing possible drug and illness associations) can identify common ADRs and in general the more common the ADR is, the fewer the number of patients that need to be prescribed the drug before it is discovered. However, ADRs that\nSeptember 3, 2014 DRAFT\n3 occur for drugs that are rarely prescribed or rare ADRs may go unnoticed by medical practitioners and may cause morbidity or mortality in patients that could have been prevented with more efficient drug surveillance methods. For example, it took 23 years before there was sufficient evidence that the drug Tamoxifen used to treat breast cancer caused endometrial cancer in about 1 in 6000 patients [11] [12].\nCurrent methods to discover rare ADRs often involve using a Spontaneous Reporting System (SRS) database that contains a collection of voluntary suspected drug and ADR reports, such as the database containing information from the UK yellow card scheme. The algorithms that signal ADRs by mining SRS databases calculate a measure of how disproportionally more often the medical event is reported with a specific drug of interest compared with any drug. The frequently implemented measures of disproportionality involve using standard epidemiology measures [13], estimating the information component using a neural network approach [14] or calculating a modified version of the relative risk by applying a Bayesian model [15]. SRS databases combine reports of possible ADRs from a large population enabling the identification of possible ADR signals more efficiently, but they are known to suffer from underreporting [16] and this causes a lag in the time it takes to confidently signal a potential ADR. The under-reporting may also prevent the detection of rare ADRs, as these ADRs may never be suspected and therefore never be reported to an SRS database.\nA potential new way to detect the rare ADRs that cannot be identified by doctors or by current methods applied to SRS databases is to use The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database (www.thinuk.co.uk), an Electronic Healthcare Database (EHD) containing complete UK General Practice records for registered patients. The THIN database contains all medical events (such as illnesses, laboratory results, signs and symptoms or administrative events) that a doctor is informed of for a patient as well as their complete prescription histories. Therefore, any rare ADRs that are serious enough to be reported to a doctor are more likely to be detected at an earlier point in time by applying a suitable data mining method on the THIN database rather than mining the SRS databases.\nExisting methods developed for the EHDs are often disproportionality based methods (methods that contrast how often the event of interest occurs after the specified drug relative to how often the event of interest occurs after any drug) similar to the SRS methods [17] [18] [19] or association rule mining methods [20] [21] [22]. As EHDs do not contain links between drugs and suspected ADRs these are often inferred by investigating medical events that occur within some time period around a drug, but many of these medical events are linked to the cause of taking the drug and these \u2018therapeutically related\u2019 medical events present a major issue with the majority of the existing methods. It has been demonstrated that these existing methods are currently not suitable for signalling rare ADRs [23]. However, it is the rare\nSeptember 3, 2014 DRAFT\n4 ADRs that are unlikely to be detected by mining SRS databases, due to under-reporting, so developing an algorithm that can signal rare ADRs using the THIN database would be beneficial.\nIn this paper we develop a novel computational meta-analysis framework that integrates the existing methods (MUTARA, HUNT, OE ratio, see section III-A) and uses information obtained from the internet to efficiently and accurately identify rare ADRs that occur immediately or shortly after a drug is prescribed. The framework uses the dependency measures obtained from some of the existing electronic healthcare based methods and novel values of interest as attributes for each medical event that occurs within a 30 day period after the drug of interest is prescribed for any patient. After the attributes are generated for each medical event we label some of the medical events by extracting information from the internet informing us of the indicator events and known ADRs for the drug of interest. The unlabelled medical events then have labels assigned by applying metric learning and semi-supervised clustering. Finally using the labels we develop a novel filter that removes medical events labelled as indicator events and then return the remaining medical events ordered by how often they occurred unpredictably within 30 days after the drug being investigated multiplied by weights based on their assigned labels.\nThe continuation of this paper is as follows, section II contains the background information on the THIN database and section III describes the problem formulation. This is followed by the description of the novel methodology we developed that is able to identify rare ADRs in section IV. Section V contains the results of comparing our novel algorithm with a section of existing methods for the detection of known rare ADRs and the discussion of these results is contained in section VI. The paper finishes with the conclusion and future work suggestions in section VII."}, {"heading": "II. THIN DATABASE", "text": "The THIN database contains complete medical and prescription records for registered patients at participating general practices within the UK. The medical information is recorded into the THIN database by Read Codes that correspond to illnesses, so each Read Code is paired with the illness description.\nEach Read Code is five elements long and the Read Codes have a tree structure. A level one Read Code has \u2018.\u2019 as it\u2019s second element and corresponds to a very general description of an illness, for example \u2018A....\u2019 is a level one Read Code that corresponds to \u2018Infections\u2019. A level two Read Code has \u2018.\u2019 for it\u2019s third element but not for it\u2019s second element, an example is \u2018A1...\u2019 corresponding to \u2018Tuberculosis\u2019. A level two Read Code is the child of the level one Read Code with a matching first element, so \u2018A1...\u2019 is the child of \u2018A....\u2019 (or A....\u2019 is the parent of \u2018A1...\u2019) and a child Read Code corresponds to a more specific\nSeptember 3, 2014 DRAFT\n5\nversion of it\u2019s parent\u2019s illness. Fig (1) shows examples of different branches of the Read Code tree with the illness becoming more specific as the Read Code level increases.\nEach drug is recorded into the THIN database by a drugcode (sometimes called the multilexeid) that is paired to the generic name. The drugcode consists of nine numbers and does not have a structure we use but the drugcode does specify the way the drug is ingested and the dosage. Each entry also includes the date that a Read Code or drugcode is recorded but does not contain the time. In this paper we used a subset of the THIN database containing records from 495 general practices. The subset contained approximately four million patients, over 358 million prescription entries and over 233 million medical event entries.\nPatients can register at a new practice at any point over their lifetime and it has been shown that statistical studies using the THIN database will be biased if records from the first year after registration for a patient are included in the study [24]. The reason for this is that newly registered patients will need to inform their new doctor of any chronic illnesses they have, but these illnesses will be recorded on the day they inform the doctor of them rather than the actual day they were discovered. To prevent bias in this study we do not include the first year of a patient\u2019s medical records since registration. We also ignore the last 30 days of prescription records for each patient to reduce potential under reporting that may occur by including patients with less than 30 days of medical records after the first prescription of a drug.\nSeptember 3, 2014 DRAFT\n6"}, {"heading": "III. PROBLEM FORMULATION", "text": "The focus of this paper is to develop a method for detecting rare ADRs that occur shortly after prescription, so we can restrict our attention to the medical events that occur around the time of the drug prescription. In this paper we consider the natural numbers N to include 0 and use the interval [a...b] to be the interval of natural numbers from a to b ({n \u2208 N : a \u2264 n \u2264 b}).\nIf we let M denote the set of Read Codes, D denote the set of drugcodes and \u2126 denote the set of patients in the THIN database then the sequence of Read Codes or the sequence of drugcodes for a patient can be represented as two discrete functions. The discrete function representing a patient\u2019s Read Code sequence is a mapping fM : N \u00d7 \u2126 \u2192 P(M); fM (t, \u03c9) \u2192 e\u03c9,t where t is the age in days of the patient \u03c9 and e\u03c9,t is the set of Read Codes that are recorded into the THIN database for patient \u03c9 when they are t days old. Similarly, the discrete function representing a patient\u2019s drugcode sequence is fD : N \u00d7 \u2126 \u2192 P(D); fD(t, \u03c9) \u2192 d\u03c9,t where d\u03c9,t is the set of drugcodes recorded in THIN for the patient \u03c9 when they are t days old.\nSeptember 3, 2014 DRAFT\n7 Using the example THIN database entries shown in Table I, we have,\nM = {A123., B21., C1..., C11.., C12.., C121., D25.., F1..., F12..}\nD = {979596759, 969686881, 912314611}\n\u2126 = {jj3, aa2, bb8}\n(1)\nThe set of Read Codes that patient jj3 has recorded when he is 9999, 10000 and 10002 days old are fM (9999, jj3) = {A123.}, fM (10000, jj3) = {F1..., C1...} and fM (10002, jj3) = {} = \u2205 respectively. The reason fM (10002, jj3) = {} = \u2205 is that patient jj3 does not have a Read Code recorded when he is 10002 days old. Similarly, the set of drugcodes that patient jj3 has recorded when he is 10000 and 10002 days old are fD(10000, jj3) = {979596759} and fD(10002, jj3) = {} = \u2205 respectively.\nThe set consisting of every age in days where patient \u03c9 has a drugcode recorded into the THIN\ndatabase is,\nAD(\u03c9) = {t|fD(t, \u03c9) 6= \u2205} (2)\nThe set of all drugs that are prescribed for patient \u03c9 is the finite union of the set of drugcodes recorded\ndaily for the patient while they are active in the THIN database, \u222afD(t, \u03c9) t\u2208AD(\u03c9) , so to determine the age that patient \u03c9 is first prescribed the drug of interest d\u2217 \u2208 D we first find the set of ages that the patient was prescribed the drug,\n\u03b1(\u03c9, d\u2217) = {t \u2208 AD(\u03c9)|d\u2217 \u2208 fD(t, \u03c9)} (3)\nand then define a new function \u03b11 : \u2126\u00d7D \u2192 N \u222a {\u22121} :\n\u03b11(\u03c9, d\u2217) =  min(\u03b1(\u03c9, d\u2217)) if d\u2217 \u2208 \u222a t\u2208AD(\u03c9) fD(t, \u03c9) \u22121 else (4)\nthat finds the minimum age that the patient is prescribed the drug or returns \u22121 if the patient has never been prescribed the drug.

The minimum age that patient jj3 is prescribed 969686881 is \u03b11(jj3, 969686881) = 20000 but as the patient aa2 is never prescribed the drug 969686881, \u03b11(aa2, 969686881) = \u22121. The patient aa2 is prescribed the drug 912314611 four times (\u03b1(aa2, 912314611) = {15001, 15031, 15061, 25304}) with the first prescription occurring at 15001 days old (\u03b11(aa2, 912314611) = 15001) but the drug was then repeated monthly two times and then the patient had a 10243 day break before being prescribed the drug for the final time, therefore the set of ages in days that patient aa2 is prescribed drug 912314611 for the first time in 13 months is \u03b1\u0302(aa2, 912314611) = {15001, 25304} as the instances when the drug was repeated after 30 days are not included.\nIn the continuation of this paper we will use \u03b1\u0302(\u03c9, d\u2217)k to refer to the kth time patient \u03c9 is prescribed drug d\u2217 for the first time in 13 months, so \u03b1\u0302(\u03c9, d\u2217)1 < \u03b1\u0302(\u03c9, d\u2217)2 < ... < \u03b1\u0302(\u03c9, d\u2217)n\u22121 < \u03b1\u0302(\u03c9, d\u2217)n, where n is the total number of times patient \u03c9 is prescribed drug d\u2217 for the first time in 13 months (n = |\u03b1\u0302(\u03c9, d\u2217)|). Following on with our example, \u03b1\u0302(aa2, 912314611)1 = 15001 and \u03b1\u0302(aa2, 912314611)2 = 25304.\nThis then enables us to define a interval of interest around each time the patient is prescribed a drug\nfor the first time in 13 months, for each K \u2264 |\u03b1\u0302(\u03c9, d\u2217)|,\nT (\u03c9, d\u2217, t1, t2)K = [(\u03b1\u0302(\u03c9, d\u2217)K + t1)...(\u03b1\u0302(\u03c9, d\u2217)K + t2)] if \u03b1\u0302(\u03c9, d\u2217)K 6= \u22121\u2205 else (6) Equation (6) is defining a time interval centred around the Kth time drug d\u2217 is prescribed for the first time in 13 months for patient \u03c9 determine by the integers t1 and t2. For example, if we wanted to investigate the 30 days after a prescription we would use t1 = 1 and t2 = 30 and the time period around the first prescriptions in 13 months of drug 912314611 for patient aa2 would be T (aa2, 912314611, 1, 30)1 = [(\u03b1\u0302(aa2, 912314611)1+1)...(\u03b1\u0302(aa2, 912314611)1+30)] = [(15001+1)...(15001+30)] = [(15002)...(15031)] and T (aa2, 912314611, 1, 30)2 = [(\u03b1\u0302(aa2, 912314611)2 + 1)...(\u03b1\u0302(aa2, 912314611)2 + 30)] = [(25304 + 1)...(25304 + 30)] = [(25305)...(25334)]. If the patient is never prescribed the drug then the time period of interest is the empty set, for example T (aa2, 979596759, 1, 30)1 = \u2205.\nAs the function fM (t, \u03c9) returns a set of Read Codes that are recorded into the THIN database for patient \u03c9 when they are t days old, we can find the set of ages in days that \u03c9 has any Read Code recorded,\nAM (\u03c9) = {t|fM (t, \u03c9) 6= \u2205} (7)\nSeptember 3, 2014 DRAFT\n9 and the finite union over each t \u2208 AM (\u03c9), \u222afM (t, \u03c9) t\u2208AM (\u03c9) , is the set of all Read Codes that are recorded into the THIN database for the patient \u03c9. It follows that \u222afM (t, \u03c9) t\u2208T (\u03c9,d\u2217,t1,t2)K is the set of all Read Codes that are recorded into the THIN database for the patient \u03c9 during the period of interest determined by t1 and t2 around the Kth prescription of drug d\u2217.

The justification for this is, if a patient had an illness shortly before the drug then having the illness repeated after the drug is unlikely to be an ADR.

When a patient first has an illness it is likely that not much detail is known, so a low level Read Code will probably be recorded into the THIN database, over time more information may be discovered about a patient\u2019s illness possibly due to laboratory results and this may then result in a more specified higher level Read Code being entered (a child of the original less detailed Read Code). As a consequence, it is common for higher level Read Codes related to the cause of taking the drug to only be recorded after the drug, so to help distinguish between these and ADRs we calculate the Read Code after and before ratio when only considering the first two or three elements of a Read Code. For example, considering the first three elements of the Read Code, the Read Code A11ab becomes A11 and the ABratiolev3 is the number of patients that have a Read Code starting with A11 within the month after the first prescription of the drug divided by the number of patients that have a Read Code starting with A11 within the month prior to the first prescription of the drug. Similarly, the ABratiolev2 for a Read Code is the number of patients who have a Read Code with the same first two elements within a month after the first prescription divided by the number of patients who have a Read Code with the same first two elements within a month prior to the prescription.\nSeptember 3, 2014 DRAFT\n15\nTo calculate these attributes we first define an equivalence relationship, ei n\u223c ej if the first n elements of the Read Codes of ei and ej are the same.

The reason for choosing three labels is because there is information available to enable us to determine the labels for a sufficient number of Read Codes when using three labels.\nWe determined the Read Codes that are labelled as noise by using the hierarchal structure of the Read Code tree.

The table also states the cause for taking the drug (the indication), the year the drug was withdrawn and approximately how commonly the ADR occurs for patients prescribed the drug. In some cases the rare and serious ADR being investigated was listed as an ADR on the netdoctor website and to prevent any bias in the results for the DRESS algorithm, any labels for the Read Codes corresponding to the ADR being investigated were removed at the end of step 2, prior to the semi-supervised steps. So the Read Codes corresponding to the ADR being investigated were always unlabelled in the DRESS algorithm.\nThe DRESS algorithm had an average rank over the drug and ADR pairs of 143.75 and had the highest rank compared to all the other algorithms for 12 of the 16 drug and ADR pairs investigated. It was able to return a rank under 100 for 56.25% of the ADRs and all the ADRs had a rank below 500. In comparison the other methods had an average rank of 344.69, 791 and 2385.73 for the OE ratio, HUNT and MUTARA respectively.

DISCUSSION", "text": "The existing methods for detecting ADRs using EHDs do not currently definitively detect ADRs, but rather, they can be considered to generate tentative ADR signals for the top k ranked medical events in their returned list. This is effectively filtering out all the medical events that are unlikely to be ADRs or the medical events without sufficient evidence (number of patients experiencing the event after the drug) of being an ADR. The medical events with a rank greater than k are ignored and the medical events with a rank less than k (the signalled medical events) are investigated further to confirm if they are true ADRs. Therefore, for an unknown ADR to be detected by these existing methods it needs to be signalled by being ranked in the top k medical events returned and the closer that the rank is to the value 1, the more likely it will be investigated further, even when low values of k are used. The results of this paper show that the existing methods are not able to rank the known rare and serious ADRs highly, so they would be unlikely to signal these for further investigation, but the DRESS algorithm was able to rank over 50% of these rare ADRs within the top 100 and would most likely signal these for further investigation. This implies that the DRESS algorithm is more suitable than existing methods for detecting rare ADRs and has the potential to discover many unknown rare ADRs.\nThe DRESS algorithm was unable to rank \u2018Naproxen and Hepatitis\u2019 and \u2018Nifedipine and weight increase\u2019 higher than the OE ratio, one reason for this is that the DRESS algorithm does not perform as well for medical events that have a high background rate as medical events that are common will have a greater number of patients experiencing the medical event in the month before the prescription and if the ADR is rare only one or two patients extra will have the medical event in the month after the prescription, so the ABratio will be close to one, but on the other hand, the OE ratio performs better for medical events with a high background rate as the bias in the IC calculation will have less impact. It might be better to have two ADR clusters, one for the medical events that occur at a low background rate and another for the medical events that occur at a high background rate, but this may cause issue if there is not a sufficient number of Read Codes corresponding to known side effects, as if there are only a few Read Codes for the known side effects there may only be one to two labelled Read Codes in each cluster and this will be deleterious for the semi-supervised methods.\nIt may be argued that the DRESS algorithm can only be applied after many ADRs are known and this may prevent it efficiently detecting rare ADRs, but rare ADRs that occur less than 1 in 1000 patients generally need three of more ADR cases before there is satisfactory evidence to confirm the ADR and this requires thousands of patients having the drug. DRESS can be implemented after a few hundred patients\nSeptember 3, 2014 DRAFT\n22\nhave taken a drug as the obvious side effects will be known, so the constraint of requiring known ADRs will not reduce the efficiency of DRESS. It is worth noting that the current implementation of DRESS will not be as effective if a drug is generally safe and does not have many side effects, but this is not common and DRESS could be modified to use the positive effects of the drug as labelled medical events as the positive effects and side effects have similar attribute values as both should increase after the drug is taken.\nThe DRESS algorithm still highly ranks medical events related to the cause of the drug and removing these medical events would greatly improve the ability to detect rare ADRs with DRESS. The expect attribute has limitations as it only indicates if the patient had a repeat of a medical event and does not make use of the medical event relations within the THIN database to determine if a medical event is expected based on related medical events. For example, if a patient has \u2018a cold\u2019 then they are likely to experience \u2018a cough\u2019 if the illness progresses, but the expect attribute only says \u2018a cough\u2019 is expected if the patient has had \u2018a cough\u2019 shortly before and not if a predecessor medical event has occurred before. To reduce the rank of medical events related to the cause of the drug a new attribute that uses sequential patterns to determine the expectedness of each medical event that occurs after the description could be used."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper we have described a novel methodology to detect rare ADRs that incorporates some existing methods (Observe Expected ratio, MUTARA and HUNT), information retrieval from the web, metric learning and semi-supervised clustering. The results suggest this methodology is able to detect rare and serious ADRs for the range of drugs chosen in the investigation and has the potential to help detect many currently unknown ADRs. The method is not able to remove all medical events related to the cause of taking the drug and future work should aim to prevent generating signals for these medical events by adding an additional attribute to the clustering that determines the expectedness of each medical event based on sequential patterns that can be mined from the whole database. Further work could also investigate different metric learning and semi-supervised clustering techniques."}], "references": [{"title": "and J", "author": ["S. Gautier", "H. Bachelet", "R.

frequently prescribed to patients with the aim of improving each patient\u2019s medical state, but an unfortunate consequence of most prescription drugs is the occurrence of undesirable side effects. Side effects that occur in more than one in a thousand patients are likely to be signalled efficiently by current drug surveillance methods, however, these same methods may take decades before generating signals for rarer side effects, risking medical morbidity or mortality in patients prescribed the drug while the rare side effect is undiscovered. In this paper we propose a novel computational meta-analysis framework for signalling rare side effects that integrates existing methods, knowledge from the web, metric learning and semi-supervised clustering. The novel framework was able to signal many known rare and serious side effects for the selection of drugs investigated, such as tendon rupture when prescribed Ciprofloxacin or Levofloxacin, renal failure with Naproxen and depression associated with Rimonabant. Furthermore, for the majority of the drug investigated it generated signals for rare side effects at a more stringent signalling threshold than existing methods and shows the potential to become a fundamental part of post marketing surveillance to detect rare side effects.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
