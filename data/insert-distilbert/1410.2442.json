While RCC8 is essentially dimensionless, most current applications are confined to reasoning about two-dimensional or threedimensional physical space. In this paper, however, we are mainly interested in conceptual spaces, which typically are high-dimensional Euclidean spaces in which the meaning of natural language concepts can be represented using convex regions. The aim of this paper is to analyze how the restriction to convex regions constrains the realizability of networks of RCC8 relations. First, we identify all ways in which the set of RCC8 base relations can be restricted to guarantee that consistent networks can be convexly realized in respectively 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D. Most surprisingly, we find that if the relation \u2018partially overlaps\u2019 is disallowed, all consistent atomic RCC8 networks can be convexly realized in 4D. If instead refinements of the relation \u2018part of\u2019 are disallowed, all consistent atomic RCC8 relations can be convexly realized in 3D. We furthermore show, among others, that any consistent RCC8 network with 2n + 1 variables can be realized using convex regions in the n-dimensional Euclidean space.\nKeywords: Qualitative spatial reasoning, Region connection calculus, Convexity, Conceptual spaces\nEmail addresses: s.schockaert@cs.cardiff.ac.be (Steven Schockaert), sanjiang.li@uts.edu.au (Sanjiang Li)\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier October 20, 2014\nar X\niv :1\n41 0.\n24 42\nv2 [\ncs .A\nI] 1\n7 O\nct 2"}, {"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "RCC8 is a well-known constraint language for modelling and reasoning about the qualitative spatial relationships that hold between regions [1]. It is based on eight relations which are jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint: equals (EQ), partially overlaps (PO), externally connected (EC), disconnected (DC), tangential proper part (TPP) and its inverse (TPP\u22121), and non-tangential proper part (NTPP) and its inverse (NTPP\u22121). The intended meaning of these and a number of related relations is summarized in Table 1. RCC5 is a variant of RCC8 which is instead based on the following five coarser basic relations: equals (EQ), partially overlaps (PO), disjoint (DR), proper part (PP) and its inverse (PP\u22121). In general, constraint networks over RCC8 (or RCC5) relations could be realized using regions from arbitrary topological spaces that satisfy the axioms of the RCC [1].\nIn practice, most applications use RCC8 to reason about two-dimensional or three-dimensional Euclidean space. For example, [2] uses RCC8 to encode how different objects in a video are spatially related to each other, and how these relations change over time. This high-level representation is then used to recognize particular types of events. On the semantic web, RCC8 is used to encode geographic information in OWL ontologies [3, 4] and linked data [5, 6], and to reason about the integrity of spatial databases [7]. It can be shown that focusing on Euclidean spaces of fixed dimension does not affect the notion of consistency which is used in RCC8 [8] (see Section 2).\nRCC8 could potentially also play a crucial role in reasoning about higherdimensional Euclidean spaces. In such applications, however, it is often natural to consider convex regions only. For example, in the theory of conceptual spaces proposed in [9], the meaning of natural properties and concepts is represented using convex regions in a suitable metric space, which is most often taken to be Euclidean [9]. The concepts car and vehicle would both correspond to convex regions and the constraint carPP vehicle then means that every car is a vehicle, while vehiclePOwooden-object means that some but not all vehicles are wooden objects (e.g. a dugout canoe) and not all wooden objects are vehicles. While the idea that natural concepts tend to be convex is a conjecture, among other examples, [9] points to evidence from cognitive studies on color spaces, showing that natural language terms for colors tend to correspond to convex regions in a suitable conceptual space . Requiring convexity is also closely related to prototype theory [10]. Indeed, a common approach is to represent prototypes as points in a feature space\nand to define the extension of concepts as the cells of the Voronoi diagram induced from these points, which are convex. In machine learning, convex hull based classifiers have been proposed [11], which are explicitly based on the assumption that categories tend to correspond to convex regions in a feature space. In particular, in a convex hull based classifier, every category Ci is represented geometrically as the convex hull of the points (i.e. entitites) that are known to belong to Ci. A test item x is then assigned to the category whose convex hull is closest. While such classifiers are often effective, classification decisions require solving a quadratic program and is thus computationally expensive. As an alternative, in [12] a classifier is introduced which encodes the intuition that when x is located between two items from class Ci in the feature space, then x is also likely to belong to class Ci. Such a betweenness based classifier also implicitly uses the assumption that categories correspond to convex regions, while being more efficient than a convex hull based classifier.\nIn computational linguistics, methods are studied to learn representations for the meaning of natural language terms as convex regions from large corpora [13]. In the context of conceptual spaces, EC and TPP relate to some notion of conceptual neighborhood (cf. [14]). For example, orangeEC red means that there is a continuous transition from colors which are considered red to colors which are considered orange, without passing through any other\ncolors. This also entails that while orange and red are considered as separate colors, there may exist borderline colors for which it is hard to judge whether they are red or orange. This notion of conceptual neighborhood has proven useful for defining commonsense reasoning approaches to merge conflicting propositional knowledge bases [15]. Alternatively, the exact boundaries of what it means for an object to be orange may be considered to be vague, but we may still use an RCC8 based representation in such a case [9], e.g. by relying on the Egg-Yolk calculus [16] or on a fuzzy region connection calculus [17]. In any case, qualitative spatial reasoning based on (a variant of) RCC8 is well-suited for formalising particular forms of commonsense reasoning about natural language concepts [9]. This application is likely to inspire further extensions and variants of RCC8 and RCC5; e.g. in [18], RCC5 is combined with a notion of betweenness to formalize interpolation, a particular form of commonsense reasoning.\nAs another example of qualitative reasoning about convex regions in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, we consider species distribution models [19], which are used in ecology to specify the environmental parameters within which the occurrence of a given species can be sustained. Typically, the distribution model of a given organism is encoded as a convex region in a Euclidean space in which the dimensions correspond to environmental parameters (e.g. related to climate and land cover). Several ecological constraints can naturally be expressed using RCC8 relations between these models. For example, knowing that the mountain lion is a predator of the bighorn sheep1, we know that mountain-lionPO bighorn-sheep needs to hold for the corresponding distribution models. Similarly, since a harlequin ladybird is a kind of ladybird, we should require harlequin-ladybirdPP ladybird. RCC8 could thus allow us to reason about ecological information extracted from text (e.g. the encyclopedia of life2), which could be useful to derive constraints that can be taken into account when learning distribution models from sparse data.\nAs a final example, we consider imprecise probability theory [20], which is a theory of uncertainty in which the beliefs of an agent are encoded as a convex region called a credal set. Specifically, these regions are subsets of the\n1http://umyosemite22.wikispaces.com/Biotic+Factors, accessed 29 November 2013.\n2http://eol.org, accessed 29 November 2013\nstandard simplex and each point of this simplex corresponds to a probability distribution in the domain of discourse. For example if A and B are the regions encoding the beliefs of agents a and b, then aPP b means that a is better informed than b, i.e. the beliefs of a and b are compatible and a could not learn anything by sharing its information with b. Similarly, aDC b means that the beliefs of a and b are incompatible. RCC8 could thus be used as the basis for a qualitative counterpart to the theory of imprecise probabilities.\nA natural question is then: how does the requirement that all regions be convex affect the realizability of RCC8 constraint networks? It is easy to see that deciding whether an RCC8 network has a convex solution in R can be reduced to consistency checking in the interval algebra [21], which is NP-complete [22]. It is moreover well known that many consistent RCC8 constraint networks cannot be realized by convex regions in R2.\nExample 1. Consider the following set of constraints:\naEC b xTPP a yTPP a uTPP b vTPP b\nxDC y uDC v xECu xEC v yECu yEC v\nFigure 1 shows a configuration which satisfies all of these constraints except for xEC v. Since a \u2229 u, a \u2229 v, x \u2229 b and y \u2229 b are necessarily all intervals of the same line, it is easy to show that additionally satisfying xEC v is not possible (see Section 5.2).\nIn [23] it was shown that deciding whether an RCC8 constraint network can be realized as convex regions in R2 is decidable, but computationally hard. Specifically, this problem was shown to be as hard as deciding consistency in the existential theory of the real numbers [24]. From this result, we can derive a similar result for regions in Rk, for any fixed k \u2265 2. We provide a proof in the appendix. Moreover, [23] shows that any RCC8 network which has a convex solution in Rk can be realized using convex polytopes.\nIn this paper, we show that despite these intractability results, RCC8 can still be used to efficiently reason about convex regions. The key insight is that every consistent RCC8 constraint network can be realized using convex regions, provided that the number of dimensions is sufficiently high. Note that as the required number of dimensions depends on the number of variables in the constraint network, this result does not contradict the result from [23], which applies only if the number of dimensions k is fixed in advance. In particular, we make the following contributions:\n1. For all subsets of the RCC8 relations, we derive the minimal number of dimensions k which are needed to guarantee that all consistent constraint networks which only use relations from this subset can be realized by convex regions in Rk. For the full RCC8, it is clear that a finite bound k does not exist. However, among others we show that if PO is not allowed, all consistent networks can be realized in R4. If only the relations in {PO,EC,DC,EQ} or only the relations in {EC, DC,NTPP,NTPP\u22121,EQ} are allowed, all consistent networks can be realized in R3.\n2. We analyze how the required number of dimensions relates to the number of variables. Among others we show that all consistent RCC8 constraint networks with 2n + 1 regions can be realized using convex regions in Rn.\nIn this way, we establish important sufficient conditions to use standard RCC8 reasoners for sound and complete reasoning about convex regions. In computational linguistics, for instance, it is common to consider highdimensional Euclidean spaces of 100 to 500 dimensions to represent the meaning of natural language terms [13, 25]. If we use RCC8 to reason about convex regions in these spaces, we can use standard RCC8 reasoners [26] if the number of considered regions is at most 2n + 1 = 1001 (in the case of 500 dimensions). In fact, 2n + 1 is the worst-case bound we obtain, and for most problem instances with more than 1001 regions, the methodology from Section 5 will still allow us to derive that convex solutions in Rn must exist.\nIn other words, the aim of this paper is to identify sufficient conditions on the required number of dimensions to guarantee that a convex solution exists. The paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we recall some basic results about RCC8 and RCC5. Then in Section 3, we give an overview of the results that are established in this paper. The remainder of the paper focuses on the proofs of these results. In particular, in Section 4, we derive the minimal number of dimensions that are needed to guarantee convex solutions when only a subset of the RCC8 relations is allowed. Based on these results, we then show in Section 5 how the number of regions and the number of occurrences of particular RCC8 relations can be used to derive finite bounds on the number of regions even for RCC8 constraint networks in which all RCC8 relations are used.\nFinally note that Section 5 of this paper presents a substantially revised and extended version of the results from [27]. The results presented in Section\n4 are completely new."}, {"heading": "2.

An RCC8 constraint is an expression of the form viRvj where R is an RCC8 relation. Intuitively, such a constraint imposes that the spatial relation between vi and vj is among those in R. If R = {r} is base relation, we usually write vi r vj instead of vi{r}vj. A set of RCC8 constraints is called an RCC8 network. An RCC8 network \u0398 is called atomic if for each i 6= j it contains a constraint of the form viRvj or vj Rvi where R is a singleton, i.e. an atomic network explicitly specifies for each pair of variables what is the corresponding RCC8 base relation. Let R be a non-empty subset of R8. If every constraint viRvj is such that R \u2286 R, then we call \u0398 a network over R. For V \u2032 \u2286 V , we write \u0398\u2193V \u2032 for the restriction of \u0398 to the variables in V \u2032. i.e.\n\u0398\u2193V \u2032 = {viRvj | (viRvj) \u2208 \u0398, vi \u2208 V \u2032, vj \u2208 V \u2032}\nRecall that a set X is called regular closed if cl(i(X) = X, where cl and i are the closure and interior operators. We say that an RCC8 network \u0398 is consistent iff there exists a mapping S from V to the set of nonempty regular closed subsets of Rn, for a given n \u2265 1, such that:\n\u2022 For each v \u2208 V , S(v) is regular closed.\n\u2022 For each constraint viRvj in \u0398, it holds that the unique RCC8 base relation which holds between S(vi) and S(vj) in the sense of Table 1 is among those in R.\nIn such a case, S is called an n-dimensional solution of \u0398. If \u0398 has an n-dimensional solution, we also say that \u0398 is realizable in Rn. It can be shown that the number of dimensions does not affect consistency: if \u0398 is realizable in Rn, it is realizable in Rk for any k \u2265 1 [8]. Moreover, there are\nseveral alternative ways of defining consistency, e.g. in terms of topological spaces or algebras [29], which are equivalent to the aforementioned notion of consistency [30].\nFor atomic networks, consistency can be decided in O(n3) by checking path consistency. Specifically, it suffices to check for each i, j, k whether \u03c1ik is among the relations in \u03c1ij\u25e6\u03c1jk, where the composition \u03c1ij\u25e6\u03c1jk of \u03c1ij and \u03c1jk is defined by the RCC8 composition table, shown in Table 2. For example, \u0398 = {v1 TPP v2, v2 PO v3, v1 EQ v3} is not consistent, because EQ is not among TPP \u25e6 PO = {DC,EC,PO,TPP,NTPP}. For arbitrary RCC8 networks, consistency can be decided by using a combination of backtracking and path consistency checking [31].\nWe say that \u0398 entails a constraint viRvj, written \u0398 |= viRvj, if every solution of \u0398 is also a solution of {viRvj}. Similarly, we say that \u0398 entails a network \u03a8, written \u0398 |= \u03a8 if \u0398 entails every constraint in \u03a8. If \u0398 |= \u03a8 and \u03a8 |= \u0398, we say that \u0398 and \u03a8 are equivalent, written \u0398 \u2261 \u03a8. For atomic networks, it holds that \u0398 |= viRvj iff \u0398 contains a constraint vi {r} vj such that r \u2208 R or a constraint vj {r} vi such that r\u22121 \u2208 R, where we define DC\u22121 = DC, EC\u22121 = EC, PO\u22121 = PO, EQ\u22121 = EQ, (TPP\u22121)\u22121 = TPP and (NTPP\u22121)\u22121 = NTPP.\nThe notion of realizability can be refined by imposing additional requirements on the kind of regions which are considered. For example, if all regions are required to be internally connected (i.e. no region is the union of two disjoint non-empty regions), some consistent RCC8 networks cannot be realized in R or in R2, although all consistent RCC8 networks can be realized using internally connected regions in R3 [8]. In this paper, we analyze the realizability of consistent RCC8 networks when all regions are required to be convex. A solution of a network \u0398 which maps every region to a convex set in Rn is called a convex solution. If such a convex solution exists, we say that \u0398 is convexly realizable in Rn.\nA non-empty subset R \u2286 R5 is called an RCC5 relation. Entirely analogously as for RCC8 relation, we can define the notion of RCC5 constraint, RCC5 network, consistency, entailment and equivalence."}, {"heading": "2.2. Convex polytopes and the moment curve", "text": "We first recall a number of notions and results about convex polytopes. A convex polytope V in Rn is the intersection of a finite set of half-spaces,\ni.e.\nV = n\u22c2 i=1 {x |hi \u00b7 x \u2264 ci, x \u2208 Rn}\nwhere hi \u2208 Rn is a vector and ci \u2208 R is a constant. The corresponding hyperplanesHi = {x |hi\u00b7x = ci,x \u2208 Rn} are called the bounding hyperplanes of V . We call F an n\u2212 1 dimensional face of V if F = Hi\u2229V and dim(F ) = n\u2212 1, where Hi is one of the bounding hyperplanes of V . A family of convex polytopes {V1, ..., Vm} in Rn is called neighborly if dim(Vi \u2229 Vj) = n \u2212 1 for all 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 m. It is well known that neighborly families in R2 can have at most 3 elements. A key result which we will use in this paper (cf. Propositions 13 and 14) is that there exist neighborly families of arbitrary size in R3 [32].\nThe Voronoi diagram induced by a set of points p1, ..., pm in Rn is the set of convex polytopes V1, ..., Vm defined as follows:\nVi = {q | d(q, pi) \u2264 min j 6=i d(q, pj)}\nThe n-dimensional moment curve is the set of points {(t, t2, ..., tn) | t \u2208 R}. Let us write M(t) for the point (t, t2, ..., tn). Note that the two-dimensional moment curve is a parabola. In higher dimensional spaces, the moment curve has a number of interesting properties. For any n \u2265 3, it can be shown that the Voronoi diagram of the points {(t, t2, ..., tn) | t \u2208 {1, ...,m}} is a neighborly family [32], and more generally that the Voronoi diagram of any finite set of points on the positive half of the moment curve is a neighborly family [33]. Using a similar construction based on the helix {(t, cos t, sin t) | t \u2208 R}, [34] shows that an arbitrarily large neighborly family of congruent convex polyhedra in R3 can be constructed.\nIn particular, it can be shown that any n points on the n-dimensional moment curve are linearly independent (i.e. in general linear position). Moreover, a hyperplane H intersects the moment curve in at most n points ([35], Lemma 6.4) and if H intersects the moment curve in exactly n points, the moment curve crosses H in each of these points ([36], Lemma 1.6.4)."}, {"heading": "3. Overview of the results", "text": "In some applications, particular RCC8 relations do not occur. For example, when modelling natural language concepts, it is often possible to organize\nconcepts in a single subsumption hierarchy. It is common to interpret such hierarchies in the following way: if concept A is a descendant of concept B, then A{TPP,NTPP}B and if A is (the descendant of) a sibling of B, then A{EC,DC}B. In particular, in such applications, there are no concepts which partially overlap. As we will show, any consistent atomic RCC8 network without PO has a convex realization in R4. When different (sets of) base relations are excluded, similar upper bounds on the required number of dimensions can be found. Figure 2 presents an overview of the results which will be established in Section 4. For completeness, we also consider subsets of RCC5 base relations, for which the results are summarized in Figure 3. For some fragments, we will show that there exists no finite upper bound on the number of dimensions.\nNote that throughout this paper we will not consider RCC8 and RCC5 networks in which the relation EQ occurs, as we can easily avoid using this relation by appropriately renaming variables. Furthermore, note that if NTPP is allowed then we also need to allow NTPP\u22121, and similarly if TPP is allowed then TPP\u22121 needs to be allowed. This means that the total number of non-empty subsets of RCC8 relations that we need to consider is 25 \u2212 1 = 31. Figure 2 shows the result for each of these subsets. Similarly, for RCC5, the total number of subsets to consider is 23 \u2212 1 = 7, all of which are shown in Figure 3.\nRemark 1. The results from Figures 2 and 3 only apply to atomic networks. For example, as shown in [23], it is possible to encode an RCC8 network using only EC and TPP which is not realizable in R2. Indeed, let \u0398 be an arbitrary network over {EC,PO,TPP,TPP\u22121} which is not realizable in R2 (we will show in Section 4.5 that such networks exist), then we can construct a set of constraints \u03a8 as follows.\n\u2022 For each pair of variables a, b such that \u0398 |= aTPP b, we add to \u03a8 the constraint aTPP b.\n\u2022 For each pair of variables a, b such that \u0398 |= aEC b, we add to \u03a8 the constraint aEC b.\n\u2022 For each pair of variables a, b such that \u0398 |= aPO b, we add to \u03a8 the constraints xTPP a, xEC b, yTPP b, yEC a, zTPP a and zTPP b, where x, y and z are fresh variables.\nIt is clear that \u03a8 only contains the relations TPP and EC. Since \u0398 is not convexly realizable in R2 and \u03a8 |= \u0398 it must moreover be the case that \u03a8 is not convexly realizable in R2 either.\nThe correctness of the results which are summarized in Figures 2 and 3 is shown in Section 4. These results are then used in Section 5 to obtain an upper bound for general RCC8 networks. The idea is to identify a subset V \u2032 \u2286 V such that the restriction \u0398\u2193V \u2032 belongs to one of the fragments from Figure 2 which is guaranteed to have a convex solution in R, R2, R3 or R4. This partial solution of \u0398 is then incrementally extended to a full solution, based on the following key property, which is shown in Section 5:\nLet \u0398 be a consistent atomic RCC8 network. Suppose that \u0398\u2193V \u2032 has a k-dimensional convex solution in which every O-clique3 in \u0398\u2193V \u2032 has a common part, and suppose that \u0398 entails the following constraints:\na1 NTPP a2 a2 NTPP a3 ... al\u22121 NTPP ar\n3We say that a subnetwork \u0398\u2193Z (Z \u2286 V ) is an O-clique if \u0398 |= z1Oz2 for every z1, z2 \u2208 Z.\nb1 NTPP b2 b2 NTPP b3 ... bl\u22121 NTPP bs\narDC bs\nIt holds that \u0398\u2193(V \u2032\u222a{a1, ..., ar, b1, ..., bs}) has a (k+1)-dimensional convex solution in which every O-clique has a common part.\nAmong others, this property allows us to show that if V \u2032 \u2286 V is such that \u0398\u2193V \u2032 does not contain any occurrences of PO, \u0398 has a convex solution in R|V \\V \u2032|+4.

The proofs are all constructive and more or less straightforward.\nProposition 1. Every atomic RCC8 network over {PO} has a convex solution in R.\nProof. We have \u0398 \u2261 {viPO vj | 1 \u2264 i 6= j \u2264 m}. Let S be defined as:\nS(vi) = [li, ui]\nwhere l1 < l2 < ... < lm < u1 < u2 < ... < um. It is clear that S(vi) is convex.

In other words, S is a convex solution in R.\nProposition 2. Every consistent atomic RCC8 network over {TPP,TPP\u22121} has a convex solution in R.\nProof. In a consistent network over {TPP,TPP\u22121}, we can always order the variables such that viTPP vj iff i < j.

Every consistent atomic RCC8 network over {DC,NTPP, NTPP\u22121} has a convex solution in R.\nProof. For an atomic network over {DC,NTPP,NTPP\u22121} we can partition the set of variables V as follows:\n\u2022 A1 = {a11, ..., a1n1} corresponds to the set of regions which are not contained in any of the other regions, i.e. for any a \u2208 A1 and any v \u2208 V \\ {a}, it holds that \u0398 6|= aNTPP v.\n\u2022 Ai = {ai1, ..., aini} (i \u2265 2) corresponds to the set of regions which are contained in some region of Ai\u22121 and which are not contained in any region from V \\ (A1 \u222a ... \u222aAi\u22121), i.e. for any ai \u2208 Ai there is an ai\u22121 \u2208 Ai\u22121 such that \u0398 |= aiNTPP ai\u22121, and for any ai \u2208 Ai and any v \u2208 V \\ (A1 \u222a ... \u222a Ai\u22121 \u222a {ai}), it holds that \u0398 6|= aiNTPP v.\nNote that if a, b \u2208 Ai, a 6= b, it holds that \u0398 |= aDC b. As a result, for any variable a \u2208 Ai (i > 1) there is a unique b \u2208 Ai\u22121 such that \u0398 |= aNTPP b. We define a convex solution S as follows. The variables a11, ..., a1n1 from A 1 are realized as: S(a1j) = [2j, 2j + 1] Assume that S has been defined for all variables in A1 \u222a ... \u222a Ai\u22121. Now consider the variables in Ai. Let aij \u2208 Ai and let ai\u22121k \u2208 Ai\u22121 be the unique variable for which\n\u0398 |= aij NTPP ai\u22121k\nLet S(ai\u22121k ) = [l, u].

It is easy to see that the following atomic network is consistent, but it cannot be realized by intervals:\n\u0398 = {aTPP d, bTPP d, cTPP d, aDC b, aDC c, bDC c}\nIndeed, if S(d) were an interval, then aTPP d, bTPP d and cTPP d mean that S(a), S(b) and S(c) all share one of the two end points of the interval S(d), which means that S(a), S(b) and S(c) cannot all be disconnected from each other.\nProposition 5.

We now show that a convex solution in R does not exist. Suppose S were a convex solution of \u0398 in R. Let S(a) = [a\u2212, a+] and similar for b, c, d, e, f . Due to the symmetry of the problem, we can assume that d\u2212 \u2264 min(e\u2212, f\u2212) and e+ \u2265 max(d+, f+). Because d and e are both contained in a, this would mean that f were also contained in a, a contradiction since f PO a is required.\nThe previous results remains valid if we replace PP by either NTPP or TPP. Hence we obtain the following corollaries.\nCorollary 3. There exists a consistent atomic RCC8 network over {PO, TPP,TPP\u22121} which has no convex solution in R.\nCorollary 4.

From a1 TPP a2 we derive that either u1 = u2 or v1 = v2. Assume for instance u1 = u2 (the other case is entirely analogous). Then we also have v1 < v2. From a2 TPP a3 we moreover find v1 < v2 \u2264 v3. Since a1 TPP a3, this means that u1 = u2 = u3 and thus v2 < v3. Similarly, from a2 TPP a4 we find u2 = u4. However, since u1 = u2 it follows that u1 = u4 and thus S violates the constraint a1 NTPP a4.\nProposition 7.

To show this, we first consider of a weakened version \u03a8 of \u0398, in which TPP and TPP\u22121 are weakened to PP and PP\u22121. From Proposition 3 we know that \u03a8 can be realized using intervals of the real line. Let [li, ui] be the realization of vi and assume that li, ui \u2265 0. We can then construct a convex solution T of \u0398 as follows:\nT (vi) = CH( \u22c3 {S\u03b8ij(lj, l2j ) \u222a S\u03b8ij(uj, u2j) |\u0398 |= vj P vi}\nwhere CH denotes the convex hull and S\u03b8ij(lj, l 2 j ) is the disc with radius \u03b8ij and center (lj, l 2 j ). By carefully choosing the values of \u03b8ij we can ensure that T is indeed a solution of \u0398, as we show in the proof of the following proposition. Note that the points (li, l 2 i ) and (ui, u 2 i ) are on the positive half of the twodimensional moment curve. Sections 4.3 and 4.4 will use constructions that are based on choosing points on the three-dimensional and four-dimensional moment curve, respectively.\nWe say that a region v \u2208 V \u2032 is at level t if there is a chain of t \u2212 1 regions u1, ..., ut\u22121 in V\n\u2032 such that \u0398 |= {u1 NTPPu2, ..., ut\u22122 NTPPut\u22121, ut\u22121 NTPP v} and there is no chain of t regions for which this is the case. Let \u2206(v) be the level of region v \u2208 V \u2032. Note that \u2206(v) = 1 iff there is no region u \u2208 V \u2032 such that \u0398 |= uNTPP v.\nProposition 8. Every consistent atomic RCC8 network over {DC,TPP, TPP\u22121,NTPP,NTPP\u22121} has a convex solution in R2.\nProof. Let \u0398 be a consistent atomic RCC8 network over {DC,TPP,TPP\u22121, NTPP,NTPP\u22121}. We show that \u0398 can be convexly realized in R2. Let \u03a8 be the atomic RCC8 network which is obtained from \u0398 by replacing every constraint of the form viTPP vj by viNTPP vj and every constraint of the form viTPP \u22121 vj by viNTPP \u22121 vj. Clearly, \u03a8 is consistent, and hence by Proposition 3, we know that \u03a8 has a convex solution S in R. Let S(vi) = [li, ui]. Without loss of generality, we can assume that li > 0 for each i. With each region vi we associate two points pi, qi \u2208 R2:\npi = (li, l 2 i ) qi = (ui, u 2 i )\nLet \u03b8 > 0 be a constant. We can then define a convex solution T as follows: T (vj) = CH ( S\u03b8(pj) \u222a S\u03b8(qj) \u222a \u22c3 {S\u03b8(pl) \u222a S\u03b8(ql) |\u0398 |= vlTPP vj}\n\u222a \u22c3 {S\u2206(vj)\u00b7\u03b8(pl) \u222a S\u2206(vj)\u00b7\u03b8(ql) |\u0398 |= vlNTPP vj} ) where for a point p, S\u03b8(p) = {q | d(q, p) \u2264 \u03b8} is a disc with radius \u03b8 > 0 centered around p. By choosing \u03b8 sufficiently small, we can ensure that Sm\u00b7\u03b8(p\n\u2032)\u2229Sm\u00b7\u03b8(q\u2032) = \u2205 if p\u2032 6= q\u2032, where m denotes the number of regions in \u0398. Accordingly, we can assume that T (vi)DC T (vj) holds for any regions vi, vj such that \u0398 |= viDC vj. By construction, it is immediate that T (vi)P T (vj) if \u0398 |= viP vj. If \u03b8 is sufficiently small, S\u03b8(pj) and S\u03b8(qj) will not be included\nin CH( \u22c3 l 6=j Sm\u00b7\u03b8(pl)\u222aSm\u00b7\u03b8(ql)), for any j. Then we have that T (vi)PP T (vj) if \u0398 |= viPP vj. If \u0398 |= viNTPP vj we have that \u2206(vj) > \u2206(vi), from which it is easy to see that T (vi)NTPP T (vj) will hold. Finally, if \u0398 |= viTPP vj, T (vi) and T (vj) will share a boundary point of S\u03b8(pi) and S\u03b8(qi), and thus we can assume that T (vi)TPP T (vj).\nThe next fragment we consider is {PO,TPP,TPP\u22121,NTPP,NTPP\u22121}. Before presenting the proof, we first give an example.\nExample 3.

Again we start with an example.\nExample 4. Consider the RCC8 network \u0398 defined by\n\u0398 = {v2 TPP v1, v3 TPP v1, v2 EC v3, v1 TPP v4, v2 NTPP v4, v3 TPP v4}"}, {"heading": "An example of a convex solution in R2 is shown in Figure 7.", "text": "More generally, note that we can always partition the set of variables V in two sets V \u2032 and V \\ V \u2032 such that \u0398\u2193V \u2032 is a network over {EC,TPP, TPP\u22121}, \u0398\u2193(V \\ V \u2032) is a network over {TPP,TPP\u22121,NTPP,NTPP\u22121} and viPP vj for any vi \u2208 V \u2032 and vj \u2208 V \\ V \u2032 (see the following proof of Proposition 10).

Every consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,TPP, TPP\u22121,NTPP,NTPP\u22121} has a convex solution in R2.\nProof.

Let V \u2032 = {v | v \u2208 V, \u2203u \u2208 V .\u0398 |= uEC v}. Then \u0398\u2193V \u2032 is a network over {EC,TPP,TPP\u22121}, \u0398\u2193(V \\V \u2032) is a network over {TPP,TPP\u22121,NTPP, NTPP\u22121} and for each vi \u2208 V \u2032 and vj \u2208 V \\ V \u2032 it holds that \u0398 |= viPP vj.\nLet \u03a8 be the network obtained from \u0398\u2193V \u2032 by replacing all occurrences of EC by DC, all occurrences of TPP by NTPP and all occurrences of TPP\u22121 by NTPP\u22121. From Proposition 3 we know that \u03a8 has a convex solution S in R. Assume that S(vi) = [li, ui]. Without loss of generality, we can assume that li > 0 for each i. With each region vi we associate two points pi, qi \u2208 R2:\npi = (li, l 2 i ) qi = (ui, u 2 i )\nNow we define a solution T in R2. For vj \u2208 V \u2032, define: T (vj) = CH ( {r0, pj, qj} \u222a {pl |\u0398 |= vlTPP vj} \u222a {ql |\u0398 |= vlTPP vj} )\nwhere r0 = (0, 0). Clearly, T is a solution of \u0398\u2193V \u2032. Now we extend T to a solution of \u0398. Let V \\ V \u2032 = {a1, ..., ak}. With each ai we associate an arbitrary point ri = (wi, w 2 i ) on the positive half of the two-dimensional moment curve such that all the points pi, qj and rl are distinct. Let \u03b8 > 0 be a constant. For aj \u2208 V \\ V \u2032, we define:\nT (aj) = CH ( {rj} \u222a S\u2206(aj)\u00b7\u03b8(r0) \u222a \u22c3 {pl, ql |\u0398 |= vlTPP aj}\n\u222a \u22c3 {S\u2206(aj)\u00b7\u03b8(pl) \u222a S\u2206(aj)\u00b7\u03b8(ql) |\u0398 |= vlNTPP aj} ) As in the proof of Proposition 8 we can show that T is a solution of \u0398, provided that \u03b8 is chosen sufficiently small.\nCorollary 6.

There exists a consistent atomic RCC5 network over {DR, PO} which has no convex solution in R2.\nProof.

We can then draw K3,3 in the plane as follows. For the nodes of K3,3, we can choose arbitrary points pa, pb, pc, pu, pv, pw in the interiors of respectively S(a),S(b), S(c),S(u),S(v),S(w). To connect pa with pu, first, we connect pa by a line segment to an arbitrary point of \u03b4(S(a))\u2229 i(S(rau)), where \u03b4(X) denotes the boundary of X and i(X) is the interior of X. This point is connected by a line segment to an arbitrary point of \u03b4(S(u)) \u2229 i(S(rau)). The latter point\nis finally connected with a line segment to pu. In a similar way we connect each of pa, pb, pc to each of pu, pv, pw. It is clear that the edges thus drawn can only intersect at their endpoints, i.e. we have shown that K3,3 is planar, a contradiction.\nNote that this proof moreover shows that there are RCC5 networks over {DR,PO} which have no solution in R2 using internally connected regions. The previous proof remains valid if we replace DR by either EC or DC, hence we obtain the following corollary.\nCorollary 8. There exist consistent atomic RCC8 networks over {DC,PO} and over {EC,PO} which have no convex solution in R2.\nProposition 12. There exists a consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC, DC} which has no convex solution in R2.\nProof. Consider the consistent atomic RCC8 network \u0398 containing the following constraints:\naECu aEC v aECw\nbECu bEC v bECw\ncECu cEC v cECw\nas well as the constraint xDC y for every pair of variables (x, y) from {a, b, c, u, v, w} which does not appear in the list above.\nAssuming that a convex solution S of \u0398 in the plane exists, we can draw K3,3 as follows. For the nodes of K3,3, we choose arbitrary points pa, pb, pc, pu, pv, pw in the interiors of respectively S(a),S(b),S(c),S(u),S(v),S(w). For x \u2208 {a, b, c} and y \u2208 {u, v, w}, let qxy be an arbitrary point from S(x)\u2229S(y) (which must exist because of the constraint xEC y). Note that qxy /\u2208 S(x\u2032) and qxy /\u2208 S(y\u2032) for x\u2032 \u2208 {a, b, c} \\ {x} and y\u2032 \u2208 {u, v, w} \\ {y} because of the constraints xDCx\u2032 and yDC y\u2032. Then we can connect x and y as follows: draw a line segment from px to qx,y and a second line segment from qx,y to py. It is clear that the edges thus drawn can only intersect at their endpoints, which means that K3,3 would be planar, a contradiction.\nAgain the proof shows a slightly stronger property than what we need, i.e. that there are consistent RCC8 networks over {EC,DC} which have no solution in R2 using internally connected regions."}, {"heading": "4.3.2. Upper bounds", "text": "We now show that consistent atomic RCC8 networks over {EC,DC,PO} and {EC,DC,NTPP,NTPP\u22121} can be realized in R3. Where the results in Section 4.2.2 rely on a construction based on the two-dimensional moment curve, here we will use a property of the three-dimensional moment curve.\nProposition 13. Every consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,DC, PO} has a convex solution in R3.\nProof. Let \u0398 be a consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,DC,PO} involving the variables in V = {v1, ..., vm}. Let {A1, ..., Am} be a neighborly family of convex polytopes in R3 such that each two polytopes Ai, Aj share a face. It is known that an arbitrarily large family of this kind is obtained by taking the cells of the Voronoi diagram induced by any set of points on the positive half of the three-dimensional moment curve (see Section 2.2).\nNote that AiECAj holds for any i 6= j. We now modify these polytopes A1,...,An to obtain a solution of \u0398. Let Hij be the unique plane which contains Ai \u2229 Aj. Let H\u03b5ij be the plane which is parallel to Hij, at distance \u03b5 from Hij and which is in the same half-space (induced by Hij) as Ai. Let H\u2265\u03b5ij be the half-space induced by H \u03b5 ij which does not contain Hij. Let cij be an arbitrary interior point of Ai \u2229Aj. Finally, let Lij be the line through cij which is orthogonal to Hij and let c \u03b5 ij = Lij \u2229 H\u03b5ij. In the following we assume that \u03b5 > 0 is chosen small enough such that c\u03b5ij \u2208 i(Ai). If \u0398 |= aiDC aj, we replace Ai by Ai\u2229H\u2265\u03b5ij ; the region Aj can be similarly replaced by a smaller region, but it is sufficient that one of Ai, Aj is modified. It is clear that then AiDCAj and that this operation does not affect the RCC8 relations that hold between the other pairs of regions (assuming \u03b5 is sufficiently small). Indeed, if AiECAz then Ai and Az are sharing a twodimensional face (z 6= i, j). By replacing Ai by Ai \u2229 H\u2265\u03b5ij , this face may be replaced by a smaller face, but provided that \u03b5 is sufficiently small, Ai \u2229 Az will still be non-empty, and a two-dimensional shared face.\nOnce all DC relations have been made to hold using this process, we turn to the relations of the form PO. If \u0398 |= aiPO aj, we replace Aj by CH(Aj \u222a {c\u03b5ij}); we may similarly replace Ai by a larger region, but it is again sufficient that one of Ai, Aj is modified. Then we have that c \u03b5 ij is an interior point of Aj and thus AiPOAj, and this operation does not affect the RCC8 relations that hold between the other pairs of regions if we choose \u03b5 to be sufficiently small. Indeed, for a sufficiently small \u03b5 it\nholds that CH(Aj \u222a {c\u03b5ij}) \u2286 Aj \u222a i(Ai), from which it easily follows that (Aj\u222a{c\u03b5ij})ECAz iff Aj ECAz and (Aj\u222a{c\u03b5ij})DCAz iff Aj DCAz, for any Az (z 6= i, j).\nCorollary 9. Every consistent atomic RCC5 network over {DR,PO} has a convex solution in R3.\nProposition 14. Every consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,DC, NTPP,NTPP\u22121} has a convex solution in R3.\nProof. Let \u0398 be a consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,DC,NTPP, NTPP\u22121}. We show this proposition by induction on the number k of NTPP or NTPP\u22121 relations in \u0398. If k = 0, then the result follows from Proposition 13. Assume that k > 0. Let V \u2032 be the set of regions which are not contained in any other region, i.e. v \u2208 V \u2032 iff there is no region u \u2208 V such that \u0398 |= vNTPPu. The network \u03a8 = \u0398\u2193V \u2032 satisfies the conditions of Proposition 13 and thus has a convex solution S in R3. We extend S to a solution of \u0398 as follows. Let v \u2208 V \u2032 and let Uv = {u \u2208 V |\u0398 |= uNTPP v}. Then \u0398\u2193Uv has strictly fewer occurrences of NTPP and NTPP\u22121 and thus has a convex solution Tv by induction. We can modify this solution Tv by a linear transformation to a solution Sv such that for all u \u2208 Uv it holds that Sv(u) \u2286 i(S(v)). Indeed, any linear transformation will preserve convexity and topological relations (including those in RCC8). Noting that \u0398 |= u1 DCu2 for u1 \u2208 Uv1 and u2 \u2208 Uv2 , with v1 6= v2, it follows easily that S and {Sv | v \u2208 V \u2032} together define a convex solution of \u0398."}, {"heading": "4.4. Fragments with convex solutions in R4", "text": "Somewhat surprisingly, there are two fragments in Figure 2 for which consistent atomic networks are only guaranteed to have a convex solution if the number of dimensions is at least four. The largest of these fragments contains all relations apart from PO, which is an important fragment from a practical point of view, since there are many applications in which the relation PO is not used."}, {"heading": "4.4.1. Lower bounds", "text": "While it is relatively straightforward to find examples of consistent RCC8 networks which do not have a convex solution R2, it is much harder to find consistent RCC8 networks which do not have a convex solution in R3 (but which have a convex solution in R4). The main idea of the following proof is\nto start with a constraint aEC b and then essentially construct a 2D counterexample in a \u2229 b.\nProposition 15. There exists a consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC, DC,TPP,TPP\u22121} which has no convex solution in R3.\nProof. Let \u0398 contain the following constraints (for all 1 \u2264 i 6= j \u2264 5):\nwi EC a ui EC a vi EC a zi TPP a xi TPP a yi TPP a aEC b\nwi TPP b ui TPP b vi TPP b zi EC b xi EC b yi EC b\nzi DC zj zi DCxj zi DC yj zi DCwi zi DCui zi DC vi zi ECwj zi ECuj zi EC vj xi TPP zi yi TPP zi\nwi DCwj wi DCuj wi DC vj wi DCxi wi DC yi wi ECxj wi EC yj ui TPPwi vi TPPwi\nxi EC yi xi ECuj xi EC vj xi DCxj xi DC yj xi DCui xi DC vi\nyi ECuj yi EC vj yi DC yj yi DCui yi DC vi\nui EC vi ui DCuj ui DC vj vi DC vj\nFor illustration purposes, Figure 9 depicts a realization of a restriction of \u0398. Assume that a convex solution S in R3 existed. For each i, let Hi be a plane separating S(xi) from S(yi) and let Gi be a plane separating S(ui) from S(vi). Let K be a plane separating S(a) and S(b).\nFor i 6= j, let pij be a point inHi\u2229Gj\u2229K\u2229S(zi)\u2229S(wj). To see why such a point exists, note that because of the constraints xiECuj, xiEC vj, yiECuj,\nyiEC vj there exist points pxiuj \u2208 S(xi)\u2229S(uj)\u2229K, pxivj \u2208 S(xi)\u2229S(vj)\u2229K, pyiuj \u2208 S(yi)\u2229S(uj)\u2229K and pyivj \u2208 S(yi)\u2229S(vj)\u2229K. Since pxiuj and pxivj are at different sides of the hyperplane Gj and both points are contained in the convex region S(xi)\u2229S(wj), there exists a point q1 \u2208 S(xi)\u2229Gj \u2229K \u2229S(wj) which is collinear with and between pxiuj and pxivj . Similarly we find that there must exist a point S(q2) \u2208 S(yi) \u2229 Gj \u2229 K \u2229 S(wj) which is between pyiuj and pyivj . Moreover, the points q1 and q2 are at opposite sides of Hi and both points are contained in the convex set zi. It follows that there must be a point pij \u2208 Hi \u2229Gj \u2229K \u2229 S(zi) \u2229 S(wj).\nWe define the line segments Li = CH({pij | j 6= i}) \u2286 Hi \u2229 K \u2229 S(zi) and Mj = CH({pij | i 6= j}) \u2286 Gj \u2229 K \u2229 S(wj). It is clear that the line segments L1, ..., L5 are all disjoint and that the line segments M1, ...,M5 are all disjoint. Indeed, if Li \u2229 Lj for i 6= j contained a point q, we would have q \u2208 S(zi)\u2229S(zj), contradicting the assumption S(zi)DCS(zi) and similarly Mi \u2229Mj 6= \u2205 would contradict S(zi)DCS(zi).\nThe points pi1, ..., pi5 occur in the same order on each line segment Li. Indeed, assume that this were not the case, and e.g. on the line segment L4 the points p41, p42, p43 occur in that order, while on L5 the corresponding points occur in the order p51, p52, p53. Since the points p41, p42, p43, p51, p52, p53 are coplanar, this means that at least two of the line segments p41p51, p42p52, p43p53 would have a non-empty intersection, contradicting the fact that the line segments M1, M2 and M3 are disjoint. Similarly, we find that the points p1j, ..., p5j occur in the same order on each line segment Mj.\nIn particular, there exists a permutation \u03c31, ..., \u03c35 of {1, ..., 5} such that the points pi\u03c31 , ..., pi\u03c35 occur in that order on each line segment Li (where pi\u03c3j for \u03c3j = i is excluded). Similarly, there exists a permutation \u03c41, ..., \u03c45 such that the points p\u03c41j, ..., p\u03c45j occur in that order on each line segment Mj (excluding p\u03c4ij for \u03c4i = j). First assume that {\u03c31, \u03c35} \u2229 {\u03c41, \u03c45} = \u2205 and let l \u2208 {1, ..., 5} \\ {\u03c31, \u03c35, \u03c41, \u03c45}. By the previous construction, the following betweenness relations hold:\n\u2022 p\u03c31l is between p\u03c31\u03c41 and p\u03c31\u03c45 .\n\u2022 p\u03c35l is between p\u03c35\u03c41 and p\u03c35\u03c45 .\n\u2022 pl\u03c41 is between p\u03c31\u03c41 and p\u03c35\u03c41 .\n\u2022 pl\u03c45 is between p\u03c31\u03c45 and p\u03c35\u03c45 .\nIt follows that Ll (which contains pl\u03c41 and pl\u03c45) intersects with Ml (which contains p\u03c31l and p\u03c35l), and thus that S(zl)ECS(wl), a contradiction since \u0398 contains the constraint zlDCwl. Now suppose \u03c41 \u2208 {\u03c31, \u03c32} but {\u03c42, \u03c45} \u2229 {\u03c31, \u03c32} = \u2205, then we can choose l \u2208 {1, ..., 5} \\ {\u03c31, \u03c35, \u03c42, \u03c45} and derive that S(zl)ECS(wl) by replacing \u03c41 by \u03c42 in the preceding argument. In general, we can always find \u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 \u2208 {1, ..., 5} such that {\u03c31, \u03c35}\u2229{\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032} = \u2205 and such that l is (strictly) between \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2032."}, {"heading": "4.4.2. Upper bounds", "text": "The main aim of this section is to prove the following result.\nProposition 16. Every consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,DC, TPP,TPP\u22121} has a convex solution in R4.\nA similar result for networks over {EC,DC,TPP,TPP\u22121,NTPP,NTPP\u22121} will then follow easily.\nBefore we present the details of the proof, we briefly sketch its intuition. We will assume that the variables in V can be organized in a binary tree, such that the descendants of a region x are those regions that are contained in x. It is always possible to ensure that such a binary tree exists by introducing additional regions in a way which does not affect the consistency of \u0398.\nThen we will associate each region x with a point M(tx) on the fourdimensional moment curve. Let x and y be siblings in the tree, and let Xx and Xy be the cells of the Voronoi diagram that is induced by {M(tx), M(ty)}. Then, as we will show in Lemma 3, we can choose the values ta such that M(ta) \u2208 Xx for any descendant a of x (for any choice of x).\nFor each x, we can then consider the set Yx = Xx\u2229{Xu |u is an ancestor of x}. For each region a and each region b such that a is not a descendant of b and vice versa, it is clear that YaDRYb. We will show in Lemmas 4 and 5 that for each such regions a and b, we can find a point qab which belongs to Ya\u2229Yb, showing that YaECYb. The proof of these lemmas crucially relies on a property of the moment curve which we show in Lemma 1, being a variant of the well-known property that for any four points on the four-dimensional moment curve there exists a hyperplane that intersects the moment curve at exactly these points, and moreover crosses the moment curve at these points.\nThe points qab will allow us to construct a convex solution of \u0398 by realizing each leaf node a as the convex hull of a small sphere centered around M(ta) and the points {qab |\u0398 |= aEC b}. The realization of a non-leaf node is defined as the convex hull of the union of the realizations of its children,\nwhich trivially guarantees that all required TPP relations are satisfied. A key result is shown in Lemma 6, which guarantees that these convex hulls cannot introduce spurious EC relations.\nThe remainder of this section is organized in three parts. First we show two properties of the four-dimensional moment curve which we will rely on in the proof. Then we discuss how the points M(ta) and qab are chosen, and we show that they have the required properties. Finally, we show how we can use these points to define a convex solution of \u0398.\nPreliminaries. The proof of Proposition 17 below relies on a number of properties about the moment curve in R4 (see Section 2.2). We will also use the following lemma.\nLemma 1. Let m1 < t1 < t2 < m2 and consider the hyperplane H = {x |h \u00b7 x = \u03b8}. It is possible to choose h and \u03b8 such that H intersects the four-dimensional moment curve at M(t1) and M(t2) and such that the function f : R \u2192 R defined by f(t) = h \u00b7M(t) \u2212 \u03b8 reaches an extremum at m1 and m2.\nProof. The function f takes the following form (a, b, c, d \u2208 R):\nf(t) = a \u00b7 t+ b \u00b7 t2 + c \u00b7 t3 + d \u00b7 t4 \u2212 \u03b8\nNote in particular that f is a polynomial in t of degree 4. The required conditions are that f(t1) = f(t2) = f \u2032(m1) = f \u2032(m2) = 0. To see why a suitable polynomial f exists, consider the family g(\u03b41,\u03b42) of quartic polynomials defined as (\u03b41, \u03b42 \u2265 0):\ng(\u03b41,\u03b42)(t) = (t\u2212 (m1 \u2212 \u03b41)) \u00b7 (t\u2212 t1) \u00b7 (t\u2212 t2) \u00b7 (t\u2212 (m2 + \u03b42))\nClearly g\u2032(\u03b41,\u03b42) has exactly one root c \u2212 (\u03b41,\u03b42) between m1\u2212\u03b41 and t1 and exactly one root c+(\u03b41,\u03b42) between t2 and m2 + \u03b42. From the root dragging theorem [37], we know that increasing the value of \u03b41 will continuously decrease the values of c\u2212(\u03b41,\u03b42) and c + (\u03b41,\u03b42) . From the polynomial root motion theorem [38], we moreover know that c\u2212(\u03b41,\u03b42) will decrease faster than c + (\u03b41,\u03b42) . Similarly, when increasing the value of \u03b42, c + (\u03b41,\u03b42) will increase faster than c\u2212(\u03b41,\u03b42). Since the values of the c\u2212(\u03b41,\u03b42) and c + (\u03b41,\u03b42) depend continuously on \u03b81 and \u03b82, and c\u22120 \u2265 m1 and c+0 \u2264 m2, it follows that values of \u03b81 and \u03b82 must exist such that c\u2212(\u03b41,\u03b42) = m1 and c + (\u03b41,\u03b42) = m2.\nNote that if \u2016h\u2016 = 1, f(t) is the signed distance between M(t) and H, i.e. |f(t)| = d(M(t), H). Also note that in the case of the previous lemma, H will also intersect the moment curve at some points M(t0) and M(t3) such that t0 < m1 < t1 < t2 < m2 < t3 and f will reach another extremum between t1 and t2. We will also use the following lemma.\nLemma 2. Let P and Q be sets of points in Rn which are separated by the hyperplane H, with Q \u2229H = \u2205. Let r \u2208 H and let h 6= 0 be a vector which is orthogonal to H such that r+h is in the same half-space induced by H as P . For sufficiently large \u03bb > 0 it holds that\nmax p\u2208P d(p, r + \u03bb \u00b7 h) < min q\u2208Q d(q, r + \u03bb \u00b7 h)\nProof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that \u2016h\u2016 = 1. Let p \u2208 P and q \u2208 Q. Let p0, q0 \u2208 H, \u03bbp \u2265 0 and \u03bbq > 0 be such that p = p0 + \u03bbp \u00b7 h and q = q0 \u2212 \u03bbq \u00b7 h. It holds that\nd(q, r + \u03bb \u00b7 h)2 \u2212 d(p, r + \u03bb \u00b7 h)2 = d(q0, r)2 + (\u03bb+ \u03bbq)2 \u2212 d(p0, r)2 \u2212 (\u03bb\u2212 \u03bbp)2\n= d(q0, r) 2 + \u03bb2q \u2212 d(p0, r)2 \u2212 \u03bb2p + 2\u03bb(\u03bbp + \u03bbq)\nSince \u03bbp + \u03bbq > 0 it follows that by taking \u03bb sufficiently large the latter expression can always be made positive, in which case we have:\nd(p, r + \u03bb \u00b7 h)2 < d(q, r + \u03bb \u00b7 h)2\nNote that in the lemma above we do not require P \u2229H = \u2205.\nCorollary 10. Let H be a hyperplane, r \u2208 H, h 6= 0 a vector which is orthogonal to H. Let p and q be two points which are both in the opposite half-space induced by H as r+h. If d(p,H) < d(q,H), it holds for sufficiently large \u03bb > 0 that d(p, r + \u03bb \u00b7 h) < d(q, r + \u03bb \u00b7 h).\nProof. Indeed, we can consider a hyperplane H \u2032 which is parallel to H and which separates p and q. The result then easily follows from the previous lemma by taking H := H \u2032, P = {p} and Q = {q}.\nCorollary 11. Let H be a hyperplane, r \u2208 H, h 6= 0 a vector which is orthogonal to H. Let p and q be two points which are both in the same halfspace induced by H as r + h. If d(p,H) > d(q,H), it holds for sufficiently large \u03bb > 0 that d(p, r + \u03bb \u00b7 h) < d(q, r + \u03bb \u00b7 h).\nAssociating variables with points on the moment curve. Let \u0398 be a network over {EC,DC,TPP,TPP\u22121}. The set of variables V can then be organized in a set of ordered trees T1, ..., Tk, such that a is a descendant of b in a given tree iff \u0398 |= {aTPP b}. For the ease of presentation, we will consider a single ordered tree T (whose root does not correspond to any region) which has the trees T1, ..., Tk as its subtrees directly below the root. For example, Figure 10 shows the tree corresponding to a network \u0398 containing the following constraints:\nv1 TPP v5 v3 TPP v2 v4 TPP v2 v2 TPP v5 v3 TPP v5 v4 TPP v5\nv7 TPP v9 v8 TPP v9 v9 TPP v6 v10 TPP v6 v7 TPP v6 v8 TPP v6\nas well as viTPP v11 for all i \u2208 {1, ..., 10} and either the constraint viEC vj or viDC vj for every pair of regions vi, vj not mentioned. Without loss of generality, we can make the following assumptions.\nAssumption 1. Every non-leaf node in this tree has exactly two children.\nAssumption 2. If \u0398 |= aEC b and a is not a leaf node, then there is a leaf node c such that \u0398 |= {cTPP a, cEC b}.\nAssumption 3. If \u0398 |= aEC b and a is a leaf node, then there is a non-leaf node c such that \u0398 |= {aTPP c, cEC b}.\nAssumption 4. There are regions z1, z2, z3 in V such that z1 and z2 are leaf nodes, \u0398 |= {z1 TPP z3, z2 TPP z3} and for every other region a, it holds that \u0398 |= {z1 EC a, z2 EC a, z3 EC a}.\nIndeed, we can always make Assumption 1 satisfied by adding extra regions (e.g. if a has three children x, y, z, we could add a new region u together with the constraints yTPPu, zTPPu and uTPP a). Assumption 2 can be made satisfied by introducing two new regions c1 and c2 (to ensure that Assumption 1 remains satisfied) and adding the constraints c1 TPP a, c2 TPP a, c1 DC c2 and c1 EC b to \u0398. Similarly, we can always satisfy Assumption 3, by introducing new regions c and a\u2032 and adding the constraints aTPP c, a\u2032TPP c, aDC a\u2032 and cEC b as well as cTPP v for every region v \u2208 V such that \u0398 |= aTPP v. Note that Assumption 3 implies that when a and b are siblings and leaf nodes, it follows that \u0398 |= aDC b. Finally, Assumption 4 can be satisfied by introducing new regions z1, z2, z3 and adding to \u0398 the constraints z1 TPP z3, z2 TPP z3, z1 DC z2, as well as z1 EC a,\nz2 EC a and z3 EC a for every other region a in V . It is clear that adding these latter relations cannot introduce any inconsistencies, as \u0398 does not contain any relations of the form NTPP or NTPP\u22121 and the composition R \u25e6 EC includes EC for any other RCC8 base relation R (see Table 2).\nEach variable v in V will be associated with a point M(tv) on the fourdimensional moment curve (with tv > 0). To choose the values tv we use the following recursive procedure Assign starting with x = root and arbitrary values for \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 satisfying 0 < \u03bb1 < \u03bb2:\nAssign(x,\u03bb1,\u03bb2)\n\u2022 If x is not a leaf node: \u2013 Let a and b be the two children of x.\n\u2013 choose values \u03b4x and \u03b5x such that \u03bb1 < \u03bb1 + \u03b4x < \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03b5x < \u03bb2; as will be explained further, the values \u03b4x and \u03b5x will need to be chosen sufficiently small in some sense. \u2013 choose values ta and tb such that \u03bb1 < ta < tb < \u03bb1 + \u03b4x. \u2013 Assign(a,\u03bb1,ta) \u2013 Assign(b,v \u2212 \u03b5x,\u03bb2)\nThe variables in the tree in Figure 10 are labelled such that they reflect the order in which the corresponding points occur on the moment curve, i.e. the following condition is satisfied:\ntv1 < tv2 < ... < tvm\nBelow, we will impose particular constraints on the values \u03b4x and \u03b5x. For now, the main observation is that for every left child x and its sibling y, it holds that the points corresponding to regions which are contained in x occur before M(tx) on the moment curve and the points corresponding to regions which are contained in y occur after M(ty) on the moment curve. In other words, we have the following lemma.\nLemma 3. Let x and y be siblings in T , with x being left of y. Let a be a descendant of x and let b be a descendant of y. It holds that ta < tx < ty < tb.\nCorollary 12. Let x and y be siblings in T , with x being left of y. Let a be a descendant of x and let b be a descendant of y. It holds that d(M(ta), M(tx)) < d(M(ta),M(ty)) and d(M(tb),M(ty)) < d(M(tb),M(tx)).\nLet x be an ancestor of a (a 6= x) and y an ancestor of b (b 6= y) such that x and y are siblings and ta < tx < ty < tb. Let Hab = {w |hab \u00b7w = \u03b8ab, w \u2208 R4}, for given hab \u2208 R4 and \u03b8ab \u2208 R, be a hyperplane intersecting the moment curve at M(tx) and M(ty) and such that the function fab : R \u2192 R defined by fab(t) = hab \u00b7M(t)\u2212 \u03b8ab reaches an extremum at ta and tb. Note that the hyperplane Hab is guaranteed to exist by Lemma 1. Let \u03bb\n\u2217 > 0. We define:\nqab = pxy + \u03bb \u2217 \u00b7 hab (2)\nwhere\npxy = M(tx) +M(ty)\n2 (3)\nWithout loss of generality, we can assume that hab is such that M(ta) and M(tb) are at the same side of Hab as qab.\nLemma 4. Let x and y be siblings in T , with x being left of y. Let a be a descendant of x (a 6= x) and let b be a descendant of y (b 6= y). Let u be a descendant of x (u 6= a, u 6= x). If \u03bb\u2217 is sufficiently large, it holds that\nd(qab,M(ta)) < d(qab,M(tu)) (4)\nSimilarly, if v is a descendant of y (v 6= b, v 6= y), then for a sufficiently large \u03bb\u2217 we have\nd(qab,M(tb)) < d(qab,M(tv)) (5)\nProof. Because of the way in which Hab was chosen, we have that fab reaches its only extremum left of tx at ta. Since tv < tx, one of the following cases must hold:\n1. tv and ta are located at the same side of Hab (which is the side at which qab is located), and d(tv, Hab) < d(ta, Hab); or 2. tv is located at the opposite side of H as ta and qab.\nIn the former case, (4) follows from Corollary 11, while in the latter case, (4) follows from Lemma 2. In entirely the same way, we can also show (5).\nLemma 5. Let x and y be siblings in T , with x being left of y. Let a be a descendant of x (a 6= x) and let b be a descendant of y (b 6= y). Let u 6= a be an ancestor of a or b and let v be the sibling of u. If \u03bb\u2217 is chosen to be sufficiently large, it holds that\nd(qab,M(tu)) \u2264 d(qab,M(tv)) (6)\nProof. Let x and y be defined as before. We consider the following cases:\n\u2022 If tu < ta, then a, b, x and y are all descendants of u. It follows that tv < tu < ta. Then (6) easily follows from the fact that ta is the only maximum of fab left of tx (as in the proof of Lemma 4).\n\u2022 If ta < tu < tx, then by construction, u is a descendant of x and an ancestor of a. It then holds that ta < tu < tv < tx. Again we obtain (6)from the fact that ta is the only maximum of fab left of tx.\n\u2022 If tu = tx then tv = ty and it follows that d(qab,M(tu)) = d(qab,M(tv)) by construction of qab.\n\u2022 The case where tx < tu < ty is not possible.\n\u2022 If tu = ty then tv = tx and it again follows that d(qab,M(tu)) = d(qab, M(tv)).\n\u2022 If ty < tu < tb then u is a descendant of y and an ancestor of b, and we have ty < tv < tu < tb, and (6) follows from the fact that tb is the only maximum of fab right of ty.\n\u2022 If tb < tu then a, b, x and y are all descendants of u and it follows that tb < tu < tv, from which we can show (6) using the fact that tb is the only maximum of fab right of ty.\nIn the following, we assume that \u03bb\u2217 is chosen sufficiently large such that (4)\u2013(6) hold for every a and b.\nWe now turn to the question how the values \u03b4x and \u03b5x in the procedure Assign need to be chosen. Intuitively, if x and y are siblings in the tree T such that x is left of y, we want to ensure that the values tv corresponding to the descendants of y are sufficiently close to each other, and that they are sufficiently far from the values tv corresponding to the descendants of x. In particular, the hyperplane Hab intersects the moment curve at points M(sab), M(tx), M(ty) and M(rab), where sab < ta and rab > tb. Let z be the parent of x and y in the tree T . Note that sab and rab depend on the choice of ta and tb: the smaller ta and tb, the smaller the values of sab and rab will be. However, from the polynomial root motion theorem ([38], see also the proof of Lemma 1), we know that moving ta will have a greater impact on sab than on rab. In particular, if rab is sufficiently far from sab, tx and ty, the impact on rab of moving the value of ta will be negligible. By choosing \u03b4z sufficiently small, we can ensure that the points ra1b, ..., rakb, where a1, ..., ak are the descendants of x, are arbitrarily close to each other. This means that the vectors ha1b, ...,hakb are all approximately located in (i.e. arbitrarily close to) the same two-dimensional plane G. As a result, it is clear that the following assumption will be satisfied.\nAssumption 5. Let a1, a2 and c be descendants of x such that tc < ta1 or tc > ta2. Let d be a descendant of y and let h\n\u2217 be a vector bisecting ha1d and ha2d. It holds that\ncos(h\u2217,hcd) < min(cos(h \u2217,ha1d), cos(h \u2217,ha2d))\nIf moreover \u03b5z is sufficiently small, the angles (hab,hab\u2032) will be negligible compared to (hab,ha\u2032b), where a and a \u2032 are descendants of x and b and b\u2032 are descendants of y. This means that the following stronger assumption will also be satisfied.\nAssumption 6. Let a1, a2 and c be descendants of x such that tc < ta1 or tc > ta2. Let d be a descendant of y and let h\n\u2217 be a vector bisecting ha1d and ha2d. It holds that\ncos(h\u2217,hcd) < min(cos(h \u2217,ha1d\u2032), cos(h \u2217,ha2d\u2032))\nfor every descendant d\u2032 of y.\nThis latter assumption allows us to prove the following lemma.\nLemma 6. Let x and y be siblings such that tx < ty and let a be a descendant of x (or a = x). Consider the following regions:\nA+ = CH{qcd | c is a descendant of a (or c = a), c 6= x, d is a descendant of y (d 6= y)} A\u2212 = CH{qcd | c is a descendant of x (c 6= x) but not a descendant of a (c 6= a), d is a descendant of y (d 6= y)}"}, {"heading": "It holds that A+ \u2229 A\u2212 = \u2205.", "text": "Proof. There exist values t\u2212a and t + a such that for every region c, it holds that c is a descendant of a iff tc \u2208 [t\u2212a , t+a ]. Fix a descendant d\u2217 of y. Let h\u2217 be the unique vector of unit length bisecting ha\u2212d\u2217 and ha+d\u2217 and let q\u2217 = pxy + \u03bb\n\u2217 \u00b7 h\u2217. Let H\u2217 be the hyperplane which is orthogonal to h\u2217 and which contains pxy (where pxy is defined as in (3)). Furthermore, we define H\u2217\u03b8 as the hyperplane which is parallel to and at distance \u03b8 from H\n\u2217, where H\u2217\u03b8 for \u03b8 > 0 is located in the same half-space induced by H\n\u2217 as qxy. Let us in particular consider the following choice for \u03b8:\n\u03b8 = min c,d d(H\u2217, qcd) = min c,d \u03bb\u2217 \u00b7 cos(h\u2217,hcd) (7)\nwhere the minimum is taken over all descendants c of a and all descendants d of y. We will show that H\u2217\u03b8 is a hyperplane separating A\n\u2212 from A+. It is sufficient to show that for every c which is not a descendant of a and every descendant d of y, it holds that\nd(H\u2217, qcd) = \u03bb \u2217 \u00b7 cos(h\u2217,hcd) < \u03b8 (8)\nWe have that either tc < t \u2212 a or tc > t \u2212 a , which by Assumption 6 means that for all descendants d and d\u2032 of y\ncos(h\u2217,hcd) < min(cos(h \u2217,ha\u2212d\u2032), cos(h \u2217,ha+d\u2032))\nThe minimum in (7) is attained for either c = a\u2212 or c = a+. It follows that (8) holds, and thus that H\u2217\u03b8 is a hyperplane separating A \u2212 and A+.\nAssociating variables with convex regions. For each region x and its sibling y in the tree, we can consider the Voronoi diagram induced by the corresponding points on the moment curve M(tx) and M(ty). Let us denote the corresponding cells as Xx and Xy. For each node a we define:\nYa = Xa \u2229 \u22c2 {Xx |x is an ancestor of a}\nIf a and b are leaf nodes such that \u0398 |= aEC b, it follows from Assumption 3 that a has an ancestor x (a 6= x) and b has an ancestor y (b 6= y) such that x and y are siblings in T . We then have that qab is well-defined.\nLemma 7. For all leaf nodes a and b such that \u0398 |= aEC b, it holds that qab \u2208 Ya \u2229 Yb.\nProof. Let a\u2032 be the sibling of a in the tree. From Lemma 4, it follows that d(qab,M(ta)) \u2264 d(qab,M(ta\u2032)) which means qab \u2208 Xa. Now let u be an arbitrary ancestor of a and let v be the sibling of x. By Lemma 5 we then know that d(qab,M(tu)) \u2264 d(qab,M(tv)), which implies qab \u2208 Xu. Since this holds for every ancestor of a, it follows that qab \u2208 Ya. In entirely the same way, we find qab \u2208 Yb.\nLet Sa be a small hypersphere centered around M(ta):\nSa = {p | d(p,M(ta)) \u2264 \u03b5}\nfor \u03b5 > 0 a sufficiently small constant. We realize each variable a corresponding to a leaf node in the tree as the convex region Za defined as:\nZa = CH(Sa \u222a {qab |\u0398 |= aEC b, b is a leaf node})\nEach region a which is not a a leaf node is realized as\nZa = CH({Zb | b is a leaf node and a descendant of a})\nFrom Lemma 7, it follows that Za \u2286 Ya, which implies ZaDRZb unless a is a descendant or ancestor of b. Moreover, from Assumption 2, we know that when \u0398 |= aEC b it will hold that ZaECZb. Moreover, by construction, it is clear that aP b when a is a descendant of b (a 6= b). From Assumption 1, it follows that then aPP b, and because of Assumption 4 we moreover have aTPP b.\nIt remains to be shown that ZaDCZb if \u0398 |= aDC b. Assume \u0398 |= aDC b. Let x be an ancestor of a (or x = a) and y be an ancestor of b (or y = b) such that x and y are siblings. First assume that neither of x and y is a leaf node. Now consider the sets Pa and Pb defined as follows:\nPa = {qcd | c is a descendant of a (or c = a), d is a descendant of y, c and d are leaf nodes,\u0398 |= cEC d}\nPb = {qcd | c is a descendant of x , d is a descendant of b (or d = b), c and d are leaf nodes,\u0398 |= cEC d}\nLetGxy be the hyperplane which separatesXx fromXy. Noting thatGxy then also separates Za from Zb, we have CH(Pa) = Za\u2229Gxy and CH(Pb) = Zb\u2229Gxy. To show that Za\u2229Zb = \u2205, it thus suffices to show that CH(Pa)\u2229CH(Pb) = \u2205. Note that if qcd \u2208 Pb it must be the case that c is not a descendant of a, since qcd \u2208 Pb implies cEC d and d{TPP,EQ}b and thus cEC b. Also note that qcd \u2208 Pa or qcd \u2208 Pb means that c 6= x and d 6= y since x and y are not leaf nodes, i.e. all elements of Pa and Pb are well-defined. It follows that CH(Pa) \u2286 A+ and CH(Pb) \u2286 A\u2212 in the sense of Lemma 6, from which we can derive that indeed CH(Pa) \u2229 CH(Pb) = \u2205. Now assume that x is a leaf node (and thus x = a). Then it is clear that y cannot have any descendant c such that \u0398 |= xEC c, as by Assumption 3, this would mean that x has an ancestor z such that \u0398 |= zEC c and thus \u0398 |= zEC y, which means that x and y would not be siblings. Hence we have that Za \u2229 Gxy = Zb \u2229 Gxy = \u2205 from which we again find ZaDCZb. Finally, the case where y is a leaf node is entirely similar.\nThis completes the proof of Proposition 16. Additionally considering NTPP relations does not introduce any additional difficulties, i.e. we also have the following result.\nProposition 17. Every consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,DC, TPP,TPP\u22121,NTPP,NTPP\u22121} has a convex solution in R4.\nProof. The proof proceeds by induction on the number of NTPP or NTPP\u22121 relations in \u0398, entirely analogously to the proof of Proposition 14."}, {"heading": "4.5. Fragments requiring an arbitrarily high number of dimensions", "text": "To prove the existence of particular types of RCC5 or RCC8 networks which cannot be realized in Rn, for a fixed n, the following well-known result is particularly useful.\nProposition 18 (Radon\u2019s theorem).

For every n \u2265 1 there exists a consistent atomic RCC5 network \u0398 over {DR,PO,PP,PP\u22121} which has no convex solution in Rn.\nProof. Let n \u2265 1 be arbitrary and consider the following set of RCC5 constraints \u0398. For 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n+ 2, add the following constraints to \u0398:\naiDR aj (9)\nFor each subset I \u2286 {1, ..., n + 2} we introduce a variable bI and for each i \u2208 I we add the following constraint to \u0398:\naiPP bI (10)\nFor each j /\u2208 I, we moreover add the following constraint:\naj DR bI (11)\nFor any two (different) subsets I and J of {1, ..., n+ 2}:\n\u2022 If I \u2282 J , we add to \u0398 the constraint bI PP bJ .\n\u2022 Else, if I \u2283 J , we add to \u0398 the constraint bI PP\u22121 bJ .\n\u2022 Else, if I \u2229 J 6= \u2205, we add to \u0398 the constraint bI PO bJ .\n\u2022 Else, we add to \u0398 the constraint bI DR bJ .\nIt is clear that \u0398 is a consistent atomic network over {DR,PO,PP,PP\u22121}. Suppose \u0398 had a convex solution S in Rn. Fix an arbitrary point pi in the interior of each region S(ai). It is clear that the points p1, ..., pn+2 are distinct, because of (9). Because of Radon\u2019s theorem, there exists a set I \u2286 {1, ..., n+ 2} such that CH( \u22c3 i\u2208I pi) \u2229 CH( \u22c3 i/\u2208I pi) 6= \u2205. As each pi is an interior point of S(ai), it follows that there exists an \u03b5 > 0 such that\nS(bI) \u2229 S(bcoI) \u2287 {p | d(p, q) \u2264 \u03b5, q \u2208 CH( \u22c3 i\u2208I pi) \u2229 CH( \u22c3 i/\u2208I pi)}\nIn particular, this means that dim(S(bI) \u2229 S(bcoI)) = n, where coI = {1, ..., n + 2} \\ I. This contradicts the constraint bI DR bcoI which is entailed by \u0398.\nThe proof of Proposition 19 remains valid if we replace the role of PP by either TPP or NTPP and if we replace DR by either EC or DC. Thus we obtain the following corollary.\nCorollary 13.

Upper bounds on the number of dimensions for general RCC8 networks", "text": "Throughout this section, let \u0398 be an atomic and consistent RCC8 network which does not contain any occurrences of EQ. The aim of this section is to establish an upper bound on the number of dimensions which are needed to guarantee that \u0398 can be convexly realized. Our strategy is to start with a restricted network \u0398\u2193V \u2032, with V \u2032 \u2286 V , for which the results from the previous section guarantee a convex solution in R, R2, R3 or R4. Then we incrementally build a convex solution for \u0398 from the convex solution of \u0398\u2193V \u2032. The main technique we use to extend the initial solution for \u0398\u2193V \u2032 is the following proposition, where a subnetwork \u0398\u2193Z (Z \u2286 V ) is called an O-clique if \u0398 |= z1Oz2 for every z1, z2 \u2208 Z.

Let S be a convex solution of \u0398\u2193V \u2032 in Rk; we construct a convex solution T of \u0398\u2193(V \u2032 \u222a {a1, ..., ar, b1, ..., bs}) in Rk+1.

Note that we can assume that Ai is nonempty because every O-clique has a common part. It is clear that we can make these assumptions without loss of generality. Note that since Ai \u2286 E\u03b4i(Ai+1), it holds that AiNTPPAj for 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 r and similarly we have BiNTPPBj for 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 s.\nLet 0 < a\u2212r < a \u2212 r\u22121 < ... < a \u2212 1 < a + 1 < a + 2 < ... < a + r and b \u2212 s < b \u2212 s\u22121 <\n... < b\u22121 < b + 1 < b + 2 < ... < b + s < 0.

First note that v\u2212 < v+. Indeed, if \u0398 6|= vP ar and \u0398 6|= vP bs, it holds that v\u2212 < 0 < v+. Now consider \u0398 |= vP ar and let i be the smallest i for which \u0398 |= vP ai, then we have a\u2212i \u2264 v\u2212 < a\u2212i +a \u2212 i\u22121 2 < v+ < a\u2212i\u22121 if i > 1 and a \u2212 1 \u2264 v\u2212 < a\u22121 +a + 1 2 < v+ < a+1 otherwise. The case where \u0398 |= vP bs is entirely similar. It is straightforward to verify that the RCC8 relations which hold between T (v), on the one hand, and T (a1), ..., T (ar), T (b1), ..., T (bs), on the other,\nare those which are imposed by \u0398. Finally, we need to show that T is also a solution of \u0398\u2193V \u2032, given that S is a solution of \u0398\u2193V \u2032. Let u1, u2 \u2208 V \u2032.\n\u2022 The cases where \u0398 |= u1 DCu2 or \u0398 |= u1 TPPu2 are trivial.\n\u2022 Assume that \u0398 |= u1 NTPPu2. By construction it is clear that T (u1)PP T (u2). The fact that T (u1)NTPP T (u2) follows easily from the observation that \u2206(u1) < \u2206(u2).\n\u2022 Assume that \u0398 |= u1 ECu2 and let (x1, ..., xk) \u2208 S(u1) \u2229 S(u2). It is clear that T (u1)DR T (u2); we show that T (u1) \u2229 T (u2) 6= \u2205:\n\u2013 If \u0398 6|= u1 P ar, \u0398 6|= u1 P bs, \u0398 6|= u2 P ar and \u0398 6|= u2 P bs, it holds that (x1, ..., xk, 0) \u2208 T (u1) \u2229 T (u2).\n\u2013 Suppose that \u0398 |= u1 TPP ai and \u0398 6|= u1 P ai\u22121 (or i = 1). Note that then u\u22121 = a \u2212 i and u + 1 > a\u2212i +a \u2212 i\u22121 2 if i > 1 and u+1 > a\u22121 +a + 1 2\notherwise. Since \u0398 |= u1 ECu2 it must hold that \u0398 6|= u2 DC ai. If \u0398 |= u2 EC ai, it holds that u+2 = a\u2212i and thus (x1, ..., xk, a\u2212i ) \u2208 T (u1) \u2229 T (u2). Similarly, if \u0398 |= u2 O ai, it holds that (x1, ..., xk, a\u2212i +a \u2212 i\u22121 2 ) \u2208 T (u1) \u2229 T (u2) if i > 1 and (x1, ..., xk, a \u2212 1 +a + 1 2 ) \u2208\nT (u1) \u2229 T (u2) otherwise. \u2013 Suppose that \u0398 |= u1 NTPP ai and \u0398 6|= u1 P ai\u22121 (or i = 1).\nThen \u0398 |= u1 ECu2 implies \u0398 |= u2 O ai and we again find (x1, ..., xk, a\u2212i +a \u2212 i\u22121 2 ) \u2208 T (u1) \u2229 T (u2) if i > 1 and (x1, ..., xk, a \u2212 1 +a + 1 2 ) \u2208\nT (u1) \u2229 T (u2) otherwise. \u2013 The case where \u0398 |= u2 P bs is entirely analogous.\n\u2022 Assume that \u0398 |= u1 POu2 and let (x1, ..., xk) \u2208 i(S(u1)) \u2229 i(S(u2)). We show that i(T (u1))\u2229 i(T (u2)) 6= \u2205 from which it easily follows that T (u1)PO T (u2).\n\u2013 If \u0398 6|= u1 P ar, \u0398 6|= u1 P bs, \u0398 6|= u2 P ar and \u0398 6|= u2 P bs, it holds that (x1, ..., xk, 0) \u2208 i(T (u1)) \u2229 i(T (u2)).\n\u2013 Suppose that \u0398 |= u1 TPP ai and \u0398 6|= u1 P ai\u22121 (or i = 1). Since \u0398 |= u1 POu2 it must hold that \u0398 |= u2 O ai. It follows that (x1, ..., xk, a\u2212i +a \u2212 i\u22121 2 ) \u2208 i(T (u1)) \u2229 i(T (u2)) if i > 1 and (x1, ..., xk,\na\u22121 +a + 1\n2 ) \u2208 i(T (u1)) \u2229 i(T (u2)) otherwise.\n\u2013 The cases where \u0398 |= u1 NTPP ai or \u0398 |= u2 P bs are entirely analogous.\nExample 5.

Figure 11 shows a possible convex realization in R of the restricted network \u0398\u2193{x, y, z, u}. The remaining regions, a1, a2, b1, b2, satisfy the condition of Proposition 20. By applying the construction from the proof of Proposition 20, a twodimensional convex solution of \u0398 is obtained, which is shown in Figure 12.\nNote that in the above proposition, it is possible that r = 0, or s = 0, or r = s = 1. We have the following corollary.\nCorollary 14. Let \u0398 be a consistent atomic RCC8 network. If \u0398\u2193V \u2032 has a convex solution in Rk in which every O-clique has a common part and \u0398 |= a{DC,NTPP}b, then \u0398\u2193(V \u2032 \u222a {a, b}) has a convex solution Rk+1 in which every O-clique has a common part.\nMoreover, we can generate a convex solution for any network, using the following corollary.\nCorollary 15. Let \u0398 be a consistent atomic RCC8 network. If \u0398\u2193V \u2032 has a convex solution in Rk in which every O-clique has a common part, then \u0398\u2193(V \u2032 \u222a {a}) has a convex solution Rk+1 in which every O-clique has a common part.\nTogether with Proposition 17, we obtain the following upper bound.\nCorollary 16. Let \u0398 be a consistent atomic RCC8 network and let V \u2032 \u2286 V be such that \u0398\u2193V \u2032 does not contain any occurrences of PO. It holds that \u0398 has a convex solution in R|V \\V \u2032|+4.\nSimilar results can be obtained based on the fragments of RCC8, identified in Figure 2, which guarantee convex solutions in R, R2 and R3."}, {"heading": "5.1. Upper bounds", "text": "We now turn our attention to the problem of deriving an upper bound on the number of required dimensions which only depends on the number of variables. In particular, we will show that a consistent network with at most 2n + 1 regions can be convexly realized in Rn, provided that n \u2265 2. This result does not hold for n = 1: although most consistent networks of three variables are convexly realizable on the real line, there are two exceptions, as made explicit in the following lemma.\nLemma 8. Let \u0398 be a consistent atomic RCC8 network over the set of variables V . If |V | = 3 then \u0398 has a convex solution in R unless \u0398 is\nisomorphic to one of the following networks:\nN13 = {aEC b, bEC c, aEC c} N23 = {aPO b, bEC c, aEC c}\nProof. Let us write V = {a, b, c}. If \u0398 contains an instance of the relation DC or NTPP then the result follows immediately from Proposition 20 (e.g. if \u0398 |= aDC b, then we can extend a 0-dimensional realization of c to a 1-dimensional convex realization of \u0398). Assume that \u0398 contains an instance of TPP, e.g. \u0398 |= aTPP b. We define the solution of \u0398 as follows, only considering the cases where \u0398 does not contain any instances of DC or NTPP:\n\u2022 If cTPP a and cTPP b: S(a) = [0, 2], S(b) = [0, 3] and S(c) = [0, 1].\n\u2022 If aTPP c and bTPP c: S(a) = [0, 1], S(b) = [0, 2] and S(c) = [0, 3].\n\u2022 If aTPP c and cPO b: S(a) = [0, 1], S(b) = [\u22121, 1] and S(c) = [0, 2].\n\u2022 If cPO a and cTPP b: S(a) = [0, 2], S(b) = [\u22121, 2] and S(c) = [\u22121, 1].\n\u2022 If cPO a and cPO b: S(a) = [0, 2], S(b) = [0, 3] and S(c) = [\u22121, 1].\n\u2022 If cEC a and cTPP b: S(a) = [0, 1], S(b) = [0, 2] and S(c) = [1, 2].\n\u2022 If cEC a and cEC b: S(a) = [0, 1], S(b) = [0, 2] and S(c) = [\u22121, 0].\n\u2022 If cEC a and cPO b: S(a) = [0, 1], S(b) = [0, 2] and S(c) = [1, 3].\nIf \u0398 does not contain any instances of DC, NTPP or TPP, then either it is isomorphic to N13 or it contains an instance of PO. In the latter case, assuming that \u0398 |= aPO b, we define the solution of \u0398 as follows:\n\u2022 If cPO a and cPO b: S(a) = [0, 3], S(b) = [1, 4] and S(c) = [2, 5].\n\u2022 If cPO a and cEC b: S(a) = [1, 3], S(b) = [2, 4] and S(c) = [0, 2].\n\u2022 If cEC a and cPO b: S(a) = [2, 4], S(b) = [1, 3] and S(c) = [0, 2].\n\u2022 If cEC a and cEC b then \u0398 is isomorphic to N23 .\nTo show that consistent networks with 2n + 1 variables have a convex solution in Rn we first need a number of technical lemmas. Let \u0398\u2032 be the RCC8 network which is obtained from \u0398 by replacing every constraint of the form aTPP b by aPP b and every constraint of the form aEC b by aDR b. We say that S is a weak solution of \u0398 iff S is a solution of \u0398\u2032.\nLemma 9. Let \u0398 be a consistent atomic RCC8 network and assume that \u0398\u2193V \u2032 has a convex weak solution in Rk in which every O-clique has a common part. Let u \u2208 V \\ V \u2032 be such that \u0398\u2193(V \u2032 \u222a {u}) is a network over {EC,PO, TPP,TPP\u22121} and assume that one of the following conditions is satisfied:\nfor every v \u2208 V \u2032 it holds that \u0398 6|= vTPPu and \u0398 6|= uTPP v (12) for every v \u2208 V \u2032 it holds that \u0398 6|= vECu and \u0398 6|= uTPP v (13)\nIt holds that \u0398\u2193(V \u2032 \u222a {u}) has a convex solution in Rk+1 in which every O-clique has a common part.\nProof. Let S be a k-dimensional convex weak solution of \u0398\u2193V \u2032. We now define a (k + 1) dimensional solution T of \u0398\u2193(V \u2032 \u222a {u}) as follows.\nLet us first consider the case where \u0398 6|= vTPPu and \u0398 6|= uTPP v for all v \u2208 V \u2032. Let A be a non-empty k-dimensional convex region which strictly contains S(v) for every v \u2208 V \u2032. We define:\nT (u) = {(\u03bb \u00b7 x1, ..., \u03bb \u00b7 xk, \u03bb | (x1, ..., xk) \u2208 A, \u03bb \u2208 [1, 2]}\nand for v \u2208 V \u2032:\nT (v) = {(\u03bb \u00b7 x1, ..., \u03bb \u00b7 xk, \u03bb | (x1, ..., xk) \u2208 S(v), \u03bb \u2208 [0, \u03bbv]}\nwhere \u03bbv > 0 depends on the relation between v and u:\n\u03bbv = { 1 if \u0398 |= uEC v 1.5 if \u0398 |= uPO v\nGiven that (0, ..., 0) \u2208 \u22c2 v\u2208V \u2032 T (v), we then indeed have that T is a solution of \u0398\u2193V \u2032. It is moreover clear that for each v \u2208 V \u2032, the RCC8 relation between T (u) and T (v) is the one required by \u0398.\nNow consider the case where \u0398 6|= vECu and \u0398 6|= uTPP v for any v in V \u2032. Let A be defined as before. We define for all v in V \u2032:\nT (u) = {(\u03bb \u00b7 x1, ..., \u03bb \u00b7 xk, \u03bb | (x1, ..., xk) \u2208 A, \u03bb \u2208 [0, 2]} T (v) = {(\u03bb \u00b7 x1, ..., \u03bb \u00b7 xk, \u03bb | (x1, ..., xk) \u2208 S(v), \u03bb \u2208 [0, \u03bbv]}\n\u03bbv = { 1 if \u0398 |= vTPPu 3 if \u0398 |= vPOu\nExample 6. Consider the consistent atomic network \u0398 which contains the following constraints\nxTPP y xEC z yPO z xECu yPOu zPOu\nFigure 13 shows a possible convex weak realization in R of the restricted network \u0398\u2193{x, y, z}. By applying the construction from the proof of Lemma 9, a two-dimensional convex solution of \u0398 is obtained, which is shown in Figure 14.\nRemark 2. Let \u0398 be a consistent atomic RCC8 network and assume that \u0398\u2193V \u2032 is a network over {EC,PO,TPP,TPP\u22121}. Then region u \u2208 V \u2032 does not satisfy conditions (12) and (13) if and only if one of the following conditions is satisfied:\n\u2022 there exists v \u2208 V \u2032 such that \u0398 |= uTPP v;\n\u2022 there exist v1, v2 \u2208 V \u2032 such that \u0398 |= v1 TPPu and \u0398 |= v2 ECu.\nLemma 10. Let \u0398 be an RCC8 constraint network over {PO,TPP,TPP\u22121, EC} that involves four variables. Suppose \u0398 is consistent but has no convex weak solution in R.

This can be checked by case-by-case analysis. We verified this using a computer program. The code of the program is available from the authors.\nWe note that each N i4 (i = 1, 2, 3) contains an EC relation. The following result is clear.\nCorollary 17. Let \u0398 be an RCC8 constraint network over {PO,TPP, TPP\u22121} that involves four variables. Suppose \u0398 is consistent. Then \u0398 has a convex weak solution in R.\nWe need a number of additional lemmas before we can present the main result.\nLemma 11. Let \u0398 be a consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,PO, TPP,TPP\u22121}. If |V | = 5 then \u0398 has a convex solution in R2 in which every O-clique has a common part.\nProof. The proof is provided in Appendix B.\nLemma 12. Let \u0398 be a consistent atomic RCC8 network. If |V | = 5 then \u0398 has a convex solution in R2 in which every O-clique has a common part.\nProof. The proof is provided in Appendix B.\nLemma 13. Let \u0398 be a consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,PO, TPP,TPP\u22121} and V = {x, y, c1, c2, d1, d2}. If \u0398 |= {c1 EC d1, c2 EC d2} then \u0398 has a convex weak solution in R2 in which every O-clique has a common part.\nProof. The proof is provided in Appendix B.\nLemma 14. Suppose \u0398 is a basic RCC8 network over {EC,PO,TPP, TPP\u22121} and V = {x, y, z, a, b, c, d}. In addition, assume that \u0398 satisfies\n\u2022 \u0398\u2193{a, b, c, d} is N14 , N24 or N34 ;\n\u2022 there is no u in V which satisfies the conditions of Lemma 9;\n\u2022 \u0398 |= {yTPPx, zECx, zEC y} and \u0398 6|= xTPP v for v \u2208 {a, b, c, d}.\nThen \u0398 has a convex weak solution in R2 in which every O-clique has a common part.\nProof. The proof is provided in Appendix B.\nProposition 21. Let \u0398 be a consistent atomic RCC8 network over the set of variables V . If |V | \u2264 2n + 1 with n \u2265 2 then \u0398 has a convex solution in Rn.\nProof. Suppose |V | = 2n + 1 (the case where |V | < 2n + 1 follows trivially) and n \u2265 2. Let W = {a1, ..., al, b1, ..., bl} be such that:\n\u2022 for each i \u2208 {1, ..., l} it holds that \u0398 |= ai{DC,NTPP}bi;\n\u2022 \u0398\u2193(V \\W ) is a network over {EC,PO,TPP,TPP\u22121}.\nNote that the number of elements in V \\ W is odd. If |V \\ W | = 1, then l = n, and we can start with a zero-dimensional solution of the unique element in V \\W and extend it to an n-dimensional convex solution of \u0398 by repeatedly applying Proposition 20. If |V \\W | = 3, we know from Lemma 12 that a 2-dimensional convex solution of \u0398\u2193((V \\W ) \u222a {a1, b1}) exists. This solution can then be extended to a 2 + (l \u2212 1) dimensional convex solution\nof \u0398 by repeatedly applying Proposition 20, where 2l = 2n+ 1\u2212 3 and thus 2 + (l \u2212 1) = n. Similarly, if |V \\W | = 5 it follows from Lemma 11 that a 2-dimensional convex solution of \u0398\u2193(V \\W ) exists, which can be extended to an n-dimensional convex solution of \u0398 by repeated application of Proposition 20.\nNow assume that |V \\ W | \u2265 7. First assume that there is a region z \u2208 V \\W which satisfies the conditions of Lemma 9. Then there exists a U = {c1, ..., ck, d1, ..., dk} \u2286 V \\ (W \u222a {z}) such that\n\u2022 for each i \u2208 {1, ..., k} it holds that \u0398 |= ciEC di;\n\u2022 \u0398\u2193(V \\ (W \u222a U \u222a {z})) is a network over {PO,TPP,TPP\u22121}.\nNote that V \\(W\u222aU\u222a{z}) contains an even number of elements. If |V \\(W\u222a U \u222a{z})| \u2265 6 we start with a 2-dimensional convex solution of \u0398\u2193(V \\ (W \u222a U\u222a{z})), whose existence is guaranteed by Corollary 3. This solution is then extended to a k+ 2 dimensional weak convex solution of \u0398\u2193(V \\ (W \u222a{z})), by repeatedly applying the method from Proposition 20, and then extended to a k+3 dimensional convex solution of \u0398\u2193(V \\W ) by applying the method from Lemma 9. Finally, by repeatedly applying the method from Proposition 20, we obtain a k+l+3 dimensional convex solution of \u0398. Note that 2n+1 = |W\u222aU\u222a{z}|+|V \\(W\u222aU\u222a{z})| = 2k+2l+1+|V \\(W\u222aU\u222a{z})| \u2265 2k+2l+7, from which we obtain k + l + 3 \u2264 n.\nIf |V \\ (W \u222a U \u222a {z})| = 4, we know by Corollary 17 that \u0398\u2193(V \\ (W \u222a U \u222a {z})) has a convex weak solution in R. By applying Proposition 20 and Lemma 9, as before, we can extend this weak solution to a convex solution of \u0398 in Rk+l+2, with k + l + 2 \u2264 n.\nSuppose |V \\ (W \u222aU \u222a {z})| = 2, and write V \\ (W \u222aU \u222a {z}) = {x, y}. Note that U = {ci, di : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k} for some k \u2265 2 and we have \u0398 |= ciEC di for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. By Lemma 13, we know \u0398\u2193{x, y, c1, d1, c2, d2} has a convex weak solution in R2, which can be extended to a convex solution in Rk+l+1, using Proposition 20 and Lemma 9 as before.\nSuppose |V \\ (W \u222aU \u222a {z})| = 0. Then U = {ci, di : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k} for some k \u2265 3. By Lemma 13, we know \u0398\u2193{c1, c2, c3, d1, d2, d3} has a convex weak solution in R2, which can be extended to a convex solution in Rk+l+1, using Proposition 20 and Lemma 9 as before.\nNow assume that there is no region z \u2208 V \\W which satisfies the conditions of Lemma 9. By Remark 2, this implies that for each u \u2208 V \\W , we\nhave either \u0398 |= uTPP v for some v \u2208 V \\W or there exist v1, v2 such that \u0398 |= {v1 TPPu, v2 ECu}.

In particular, we construct a convex weak solution of V \\ (W \u222a {x, y, z}) in Rl, with |V \\ (W \u222a{x, y, z})| = 2l+2. Then we extend it to a convex weak solution of V \\W in Rl+1 using the method from Proposition 20, and we modify it to a convex solution in Rl+2 of V \\W . Finally, we extend it to a convex solution in Rn of \u0398.\nThe only remaining case is where |V \\(W \u222a{x, y, z})| = 4. If V \\(W \u222a{x, y, z}) is not isomorphic to one of the networks N14 , N24 , N34 , we can construct a convex weak solution in R and extend it to a convex solution in Rn of \u0398 as before. Let us write V \\ (W \u222a {x, y, z}) = {a, b, c, d} and assume that \u0398\u2193{a, b, c, d} is isomorphic to one of N14 , N24 , N34 .

The counterexamples we have provided for two and three dimensions are optimal, in the sense that they involve 2n + 2 regions, i.e. any convex network with fewer regions would necessarily be realizable by convex regions in n dimensions. The counterexample for n \u2265 4 dimensions, on the other hand, uses 3n regions, and the question whether counterexamples with fewer regions exist remains open."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions", "text": "We have studied how the consistency problem for RCC8 networks is affected by the requirement that all regions need to be convex. Previous results about convexity in RCC8 have been largely negative: for any fixed number of dimensions k, deciding whether a consistent RCC8 network \u0398 can be realized using convex regions in Rk is computationally hard [23]. In contrast, we have identified a number of important sufficient conditions under which consistent RCC8 networks have convex solutions. First, we have identified all restrictions on the set of base relations that guarantee that consistent atomic networks can be convexly realized in R, R2, R3 and R4. Second, we have shown an upper bound which only depends on the number of regions, i.e. every consistent RCC8 network with at most 2n+ 1 regions can be convexly realized in Rn (n \u2265 2).\nOur main motivation in this paper was to justify the use of standard RCC8 reasoners to reason about convex regions in high-dimensional spaces, e.g. to support qualitative reasoning about conceptual spaces [9, 39]. While existing work on conceptual spaces is mostly based on geometric representations (e.g. corresponding to the Voronoi diagram induced by a set of prototypes [9]), in practice it can be difficult to obtain accurate region-based representations from data, especially for concepts which are relatively rare.\nIn contrast, existing lexical resources such as WordNet4 and ConcepNet5 encode several relations that can be interpreted as qualitative spatial relations between conceptual space representations. For example, the hypernym/hyponym relations encoded in WordNet can be seen as PP and from ConceptNet it is sometimes possible to derive EC relations. For example, ConceptNet encodes6 that \u201cjogging is a kind of exercise similar to running\u201d and \u201cjogging is slower than running\u201d, from which we may derive joggingEC running. Similarly, natural language processing methods, e.g. based on Hearst patterns [40], can be used to learn qualitative semantic relations from natural language sentences. To use such knowledge about the meaning of concepts in applications, we therefore need methods for qualitative reasoning about meaning. The results we have presented in this paper provide the first step towards such applications.\nFuture work will build on these results by investigating generalizations of RCC5 and RCC8 which are tailored towards reasoning about concepts. For example, [18] has focused on adding a betweenness relation to RCC5, which is important for formalizing particular forms of commonsense reasoning [41]. In [42], a logic for concepts is introduced in which comparative distance can be expressed (i.e. \u201ca is closer to b than to c\u201d), which is important for formalizing categorization, but without guarantees that concepts can be realized as convex regions. An interesting question would then be whether the results from this paper, viz. the observation that requiring convexity does not affect consistency if the number of dimensions is sufficiently large, carries over to such more expressive settings."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank the anonymous reviewers for their invaluable comments and detailed suggestions.

Complexity of deciding convex realizability in Rk", "text": "In [23] it was shown that deciding whether a set of RCC8 constraints has a convex solution in R2 is as hard as deciding the consistency of a set of algebraic equations (of similar size) over the real numbers. This latter problem belongs to the complexity class \u2203R, which has been introduced in [43]. The class \u2203R is known to be in PSPACE and to contain NP, but its exact relationship with the polynomial hierarchy is yet to be determined. Here we show that deciding whether a set of RCC8 constraints has a convex solution in Rk is \u2203R-complete for any fixed k \u2265 2. The membership proof follows easily from the membership proof for the 2-dimensional case (cf. the remark after Corollary 2 in [23]).\nWe show by induction that deciding whether a (not necessarily atomic) consistent RCC8 network over {PP,EC} has a convex solution in Rk is \u2203Rhard. The case k = 2 has been shown in [23]. Now suppose that we have already shown this result for k = n \u2212 1. Let \u0398 be any consistent RCC8 network over {PP,EC} and let V be the set of variables occurring in \u0398. We construct the RCC8 network \u03a8 by adding to \u0398 the following constraints:\n\u2022 aEC b (for a and b fresh variables);\n\u2022 v1 PP v, v2 PP v, v1 PP a and v2 PP b for every v \u2208 V (where v1 and v2 are fresh variables);\n\u2022 u1 EC v1 and u2 EC v2 for every constraint of the form uEC v in \u0398.\nWe show that \u03a8 has a convex solution in Rn iff \u0398 has a convex solution in Rn\u22121. First suppose that \u0398 has a convex solution S in Rn\u22121 and let X = CH{S(v) | v \u2208 V }. Then we can define a convex solution T of \u03a8 in Rn as follows:\nT (a) = {(x1, ..., xn\u22121, y) | (x1, ..., xn\u22121) \u2208 X, y \u2208 [\u22121, 0]} T (b) = {(x1, ..., xn\u22121, y) | (x1, ..., xn\u22121) \u2208 X, y \u2208 [0, 1]}\nand for each u \u2208 V\nT (u) = {(x1, ..., xn\u22121, y) | (x1, ..., xn\u22121) \u2208 S(u), y \u2208 [\u22121, 1]} T (u1) = {(x1, ..., xn\u22121, y) | (x1, ..., xn\u22121) \u2208 S(u), y \u2208 [\u22121, 0]} T (u2) = {(x1, ..., xn\u22121, y) | (x1, ..., xn\u22121) \u2208 S(u), y \u2208 [0, 1]}\nIt is straightforward to verify that T is indeed a convex solution of \u03a8. Conversely, assume that \u03a8 has a convex solution T in Rn. From aEC b it follows that there is an n \u2212 1 dimensional hyperplane H separating T (a) and T (b). For v \u2208 V , we define:\nS(v) = H \u2229 T (v)\nBecause T (v1) and T (v2) are at opposite sides of H, we find that H \u2229 T (v) corresponds to a regular closed region in Rn\u22121. It is also clear from the convexity of T (v) that S(v) is convex. Finally, we need to show that S is a solution of \u0398.\nFor a constraint of the form uEC v \u2208 \u0398, we know that \u03a8 contains the constraints u1 EC v1 and u2 EC v2, and we can thus choose points p \u2208 T (u1)\u2229 T (v1) and q \u2208 T (u2) \u2229 T (v2). The line segment between p and q intersects the hyperplane H at a point r. Since p \u2208 T (u)\u2229 T (v) and q \u2208 T (u)\u2229 T (v), because of the convexity of T (u) and T (v), we find r \u2208 T (u) \u2229 T (v), and thus S(u) \u2229 S(v) 6= \u2205. Furthermore it is clear that S(u) and S(v) cannot overlap, hence we find that S satisfies the constraint uEC v.\nFor a constraint of the form uPP v \u2208 \u0398, it is clear from T (u) \u2282 T (v) that S(u) \u2286 S(v). Moreover, we can assume without loss of generality that whenever uPP v \u2208 \u0398 there is a z \u2208 V such that uEC z and zTPP v (i.e. we can always introduce such variables z without affecting the consistency of \u0398). It then easily follows from S(u) \u2286 S(v) that S(u) \u2282 S(v)."}, {"heading": "Appendix B. Proofs of the lemmas from Section 5.1", "text": "Lemma 11.

Finally, if \u0398 |= cPO e, then the conditions of Lemma 9 are also satisfied for V \u2032 = {a, b, d, e} and u = c.

If \u0398 |= dTPP e and e.g. \u0398 |= aPO e, the conditions of Lemma 9 are satisfied for u = a and \u0398\u2193{b, c, d, e} is not isomorphic to any of N14 , N 2 4 , N 3 4 . If \u0398 does not contain any occurrences of TPP and each subnetwork of size four is isomorphic to the networks N14 , N 2 4 and N 3 4 from Lemma 10, then \u0398 is isomorphic to the network N145 which we already considered.\nLemma 12. Let \u0398 be a consistent atomic RCC8 network. If |V | = 5 then \u0398 has a convex solution in R2 in which every O-clique has a common part. Proof. Let V = {a, b, c, d, e}. If \u0398 does not contain any occurrences of NTPP or DC, the result follows directly from Lemma 11. Therefore assume that \u0398 |= d{DC,NTPP}e. \u2022 If \u0398\u2193{a, b, c} is convexly realizable in R, it follows from Proposition 20\nthat \u0398 has a convex solution in R2.\n\u2022 Suppose \u0398\u2193{a, b, c} is isomorphic to the network N13 from Lemma 8.\n\u2013 First assume that \u0398 6|= xPP y for any x \u2208 {d, e} and y \u2208 {a, b, c}. Let \u0398\u2032 be obtained from \u0398 by weakening the constraints aEC b, bEC c and aEC c to aDR b, bDR c and aDR c. Let S \u2032 be an arbitrary convex solution in R of \u0398\u2032\u2193{a, b, c} and let T \u2032 be the resulting convex solution in R2 of \u0398\u2032 which is obtained by applying Proposition 20. Let a\u2212, b\u2212, c\u2212, d\u2212, e\u2212, a+, b+, c+, d+, e+\nbe defined as in the proof of Proposition 20, then we have e.g. T \u2032(a) = {(x, y) |x \u2208 S \u2032(a), y \u2208 [a\u2212, a+]} and similar for b, c, d and e. A property of the construction from the proof of Proposition 20 is that the values of a\u2212, b\u2212, c\u2212, a+, b+, c+ do not depend on S \u2032; they only depend on the choice of d\u2212, d+, e\u2212, e+. Assume a\u2212 \u2264 b\u2212 \u2264 c\u2212 (the other cases are isomorphic). We now define a convex solution T of \u0398 as follows:\nT (a) = {(x, y) |x \u2208 [\u22121, 0], y \u2208 [a\u2212, a+]} T (b) = {(x \u00b7 (\u03bb\u2212 b\u2212), \u03bb) |\u03bb \u2208 [b\u2212, b+], x \u2208 [1, 2]} T (c) = {(x \u00b7 (\u03bb\u2212 b\u2212), \u03bb) |\u03bb \u2208 [c\u2212, c+], x \u2208 [0, 1]} T (d) = {(x, y) |x \u2208 [\u22122,max(2(b+ \u2212 b\u2212), c+ \u2212 b\u2212) + 1], y \u2208 [d\u2212, d+]} T (e) = {(x, y) |x \u2208 [\u22123,max(2(b+ \u2212 b\u2212), c+ \u2212 b\u2212) + 2], y \u2208 [e\u2212, e+]}\nIt is easy to verify that T is indeed a solution of \u0398. As an illustration of this procedure, consider the following network:\na\nb c\nd e\n(N165 )\nwhere the absence of an arrow denotes DC and a single arrow, solid line and dotted line denote TPP, PO and EC as before. The convex solution in R2 which is obtained by applying the above procedure is shown in Figure B.16.\n\u2013 Now assume that \u0398 |= ePP a. The main idea is to use a procedure similar to the method from Proposition 20 to extend a convex solution in R of \u0398\u2193{b, c} to a convex solution in R2 of \u0398. In fact, if dNTPP a and aNTPP e both hold, or dDC e and aNTPP d, we can simply apply the method from Proposition 20. However, we may also have dTPP a, eTPP a, aTPP e or aPO e, but these cases can be handled in a similar way. As an example, in Figure B.16 a convex solution is shown of the following network:\na\nb c\nd\n33\n+3 e\n(N175 )\nwhere a double arrow denotes NTPP.\n\u2022 Suppose \u0398\u2193{a, b, c} is isomorphic to the network N23 from Lemma 8.\n\u2013 First assume that \u0398 6|= xPP y for any x \u2208 {d, e} and y \u2208 {a, b, c}. Let \u0398\u2032 be defined as before and let again a\u2212, b\u2212, c\u2212, d\u2212, e\u2212, a+, b+, c+, d+, e+ be the bounds obtained from the solution T \u2032 of \u0398\u2032. A property of the bounds a\u2212, a+, c\u2212, c+ is that [a\u2212, a+]\u2229 [c\u2212, c+] 6= \u2205. Let l \u2208 [a\u2212, a+] \u2229 [c\u2212, c+]. We define a convex solution T \u2032 in R2 as follows:\nT (a) = CH({(x, y) |x \u2208 [0, 2], y \u2208 [a\u2212, a+]} \u222a {(3, l)}) T (b) = {(x, y) |x \u2208 [1, 3], y \u2208 [b\u2212, b+]} T (c) = {(x, y) |x \u2208 [3, 4], y \u2208 [c\u2212, c+]} T (d) = {(x, y) |x \u2208 [\u22121, 5], y \u2208 [d\u2212, d+]} T (e) = {(x, y) |x \u2208 [\u22122, 6], y \u2208 [e\u2212, e+]}\n(a) N165 (b) N 17 5 (c) N 18 5\n(d) N195 (e) N 20 5\nLemma 13. Let \u0398 be a consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,PO, TPP,TPP\u22121} and V = {x, y, c1, c2, d1, d2}. If \u0398 |= {c1 EC d1, c2 EC d2}\nthen \u0398 has a convex weak solution in R2 in which every O-clique has a common part.\nProof. Suppose \u0398 6|= xEC y. If there is an i such that \u0398\u2193{x, y, ci, di} is not isomorphic to the networks N14 and N 3 4 from Lemma 10 (noting that \u0398\u2193{x, y, ci, di} cannot be isomorphic to N24 ), it holds that \u0398\u2193{x, y, ci, di} has a convex weak solution in R, which can be extended to a convex weak solution in R2 using Proposition 20. Therefore we assume that for every choice of i, it holds that \u0398\u2193{x, y, ci, di} is isomorphic to N14 or N34 . This implies in particular that \u0398 |= xPO y, as otherwise \u0398\u2193{x, y, ci, di} will be not isomorphic to N14 , N24 and N34 . Furthermore, if \u0398 |= ciEC dj we can assume that \u0398\u2193({x, y, c1, c2, d1, d2} \\ {ci, dj}) is not isomorphic to N14 , N24 and N34 because otherwise we could again obtain a convex weak solution in R2 by using Proposition 20. Under these assumptions, we can show that \u0398 is isomorphic to one of the following networks:\nc1 d1\nx \\\\ xx ff y\nc2 d2\nc1 d1\nx \\\\ xx ff y\nc2 d2\nc1 d1\nx \\\\ xx ff y\nc2 d2\n(N16 ) (N 2 6 ) (N 3 6 )\nc1 d1\nx xx\ny88BB\nc2 d2\nc1 d1\nx xx\ny\nc2 d2\nc1 d1\nx y\nc2 d2\n(N46 ) (N 5 6 ) (N 6 6 )\nc1 d1\nx y\nc2 d2\nc1 d1\nx y\nc2 d2\nc1 d1\nx y\nc2 d2\n(N76 ) (N 8 6 ) (N 9 6 )\nc1 d1\nx y\nc2 d2\nc1 d1\nx y\nc2 d2\n(N106 ) (N 11 6 )\nThese networks have a convex solution in R2, as shown in Figure B.17. Suppose \u0398 |= xEC y. For convenience, we write c3 = x and d3 = y. If \u0398\u2193{ci, cj, di, dj} (i 6= j) is not isomorphic to N24 (note that it cannot be isomorphic to N14 and N 3 4 ), then \u0398 has a convex weak solution in R2 as before. Suppose on the other hand that for each i and j, \u0398\u2193{ci, cj, di, dj} is isomorphic to N24 . Then \u0398 is isomorphic to the following network:\nc1 d1\nc2 d2\nc3 d3\n(N126 )\nA convex solution of N86 is shown in Figure B.17.\nLemma 14. Suppose \u0398 is a basic RCC8 network over {EC,PO,TPP, TPP\u22121} and V = {x, y, z, a, b, c, d}. In addition, assume that \u0398 satisfies\n\u2022 \u0398\u2193{a, b, c, d} is N14 , N24 or N34 ;\n\u2022 there is no u in V which satisfies the conditions of Lemma 9;\n\u2022 \u0398 |= {yTPPx, zECx, zEC y} and \u0398 6|= xTPP v for v \u2208 {a, b, c, d}.\nThen \u0398 has a convex weak solution in R2 in which every O-clique has a common part.\nProof. Since there is no region u \u2208 V which satisfies the conditions of Lemma 9, by Remark 2, there exist v1, v2 such that \u0398 |= {v1 TPPu, v2 ECu} for every maximal region u in \u0398. In particular, we know x is such a maximal region in \u0398.\nWe note that if one of the following two conditions is satisfied, then using the method from Proposition 20 we can get a convex weak solution of \u0398 in R2 by extending a convex weak solution of \u0398\u2193(V \\ {u1, u2, u3, u4}) in R:\n(\u2203u1, u2, u3, u4 \u2208 V ) \u0398 |= {u1 TPPu2, u2 TPPu3, u3 ECu4} (B.1) (\u2203u1, u2, u3, u4 \u2208 V ) \u0398 |= {u1 TPPu2, u3 TPPu4, u2 ECu4}. (B.2)\nIn the following, we assume \u0398 satisfies neither (B.1) nor (B.2). As a consequence, we know that\n\u0398 6|= vTPP y, \u0398 6|= vTPP z, and \u0398 6|= {yTPP v, vTPPx} for v \u2208 {a, b, c, d}.\nSuppose v, w are two regions in {a, b, c, d} and \u0398 |= vECw. We assert that v, w cannot be both maximal in \u0398. We prove this by contradiction. Since v, w are maximal in \u0398, we know in particular \u0398 6|= vTPPx, \u0398 6|= wTPPx. Moreover, by Remark 2, we have \u0398 |= yTPP v or \u0398 |= zTPP v, and \u0398 |= yTPPw or \u0398 |= zTPPw. Note that if \u0398 |= {zTPP v, yTPPw} or \u0398 |= {zTPPw, yTPP v}, then (B.2) is satisfied and this contradicts our assumption. Also note that neither \u0398 |= {zTPP v, zTPPw} nor \u0398 |= {yTPP v, yTPPw} is possible as \u0398 |= vECw. Therefore, v, w cannot be both maximal.\nSuppose \u0398\u2193{a, b, c, d} is N24 . Note that \u0398 |= {aEC b, cEC d}. If neither a nor b is maximal, then we have \u0398 |= {aTPPx, bTPPx}. Furthermore, by \u0398 |= zECx, we know \u0398 |= {zEC a, zEC b, zECx, zEC y}. Because \u0398\u2193{x, y, a, b} is isomorphic to none of N14 , N24 and N34 , it has a convex weak solution in R. Since z is EC to all these four regions, we can extend it to a convex weak solution for \u0398\u2193{x, y, z, a, b} in R. Now, using Proposition 20, we can further extend this to a convex weak solution of \u0398 in R2.\nWe next consider the subcase when exact one of a, b is maximal. Without loss of generality, we assume that a is maximal and b is not. It is clear that \u0398\u2193{x, y, a, b} is not isomorphic to any of N14 , N24 and N34 and, hence, has a convex weak solution S in R. Write S(a) = [a\u2212, a+] and similarly for b, x, y. We have either a\u2212 < x\u2212 < a+ < x+ or x\u2212 < a\u2212 < x+ < a+. It is easy to see that there is an interval which is contained in (or partially overlaps, or is disjoint from) [a\u2212, a+], which is EC to the other three intervals. Therefore, we can construct a convex weak solution in R for \u0398\u2193{x, y, z, a, b}, which can be extended to a convex weak solution in R2 for \u0398 by using Proposition 20.\nSuppose \u0398\u2193{a, b, c, d} is N34 and \u0398 |= {aEC b, aEC c, bEC c}. At most one of a, b, c can be maximal in \u0398. Without loss of generality, we assume c is not maximal. There are two subcases. Suppose d is not maximal either. Then we have \u0398 |= {cTPPx, dTPPx} and hence \u0398 |= {zEC c, zEC d, zECx, zEC y}. Just as before, we can construct a convex weak solution in R for \u0398\u2193{x, y, z, c, d} and extend it to a convex weak solution of \u0398 in R2.\nWe next consider the subcase when c is not maximal and d is maximal. Because c is not maximal, we have \u0398 |= cTPPx. Furthermore, because d is maximal, we have either \u0398 |= zTPP d, yEC d} or \u0398 |= {yTPP d, zEC d}. In both cases, we can construct a convex weak solution in R for \u0398\u2193{x, y, c, d} and then extend it to a convex weak solution of \u0398\u2193{x, y, z, c, d} in R and to a convex weak solution of \u0398 in R2 as before.\nSuppose \u0398\u2193{a, b, c, d} is N14 and \u0398 |= {aEC b, aTPP c, bTPP c}. Because \u0398 does not satisfy (B.1), we know \u0398 6|= cTPPx and hence c is maximal in \u0398. We have \u0398 |= cPOx and either \u0398 |= yEC c or \u0398 |= zEC c. Since z does not satisfy the conditions of Lemma 9 and \u0398 6|= {zTPP a, zTPP b}, we know \u0398 |= zTPP c or \u0398 |= zTPP d. If d is not maximal, then \u0398 |= dTPPx, and hence\n\u0398 |= {dTPPx, zEC d, zTPP c, yEC c, y{EC,PO}d}.\nIf d is maximal, then we have either \u0398 |= {zTPP d, yEC d} or \u0398 |= {yTPP d, zEC d}. In the first case, we have either\n\u0398 |= {zTPP d, yEC d, xPO d, yEC c, z{EC,PO,TPP}c}\nor\n\u0398 |= {zTPP d, yEC d, xPO d, zEC c, y{EC,PO,TPP}c}.\nIn the second case, we have\n\u0398 |= {yTPP d, zEC d, xPO d, zTPP c, yEC c}.\nIn all these cases, we can construct a convex weak solution in R for \u0398\u2193{x, y, c, d} and then extend it to \u0398\u2193{x, y, z, c, d} in R and to \u0398 in R2 as before."}], "references": [{"title": "A spatial logic based on regions and connection", "author": ["D.

qualitative spatial relations between regions, such as adjacency, overlap and parthood, can be expressed. While RCC8 is essentially dimensionless, most current applications are confined to reasoning about two-dimensional or threedimensional physical space. In this paper, however, we are mainly interested in conceptual spaces, which typically are high-dimensional Euclidean spaces in which the meaning of natural language concepts can be represented using convex regions. The aim of this paper is to analyze how the restriction to convex regions constrains the realizability of networks of RCC8 relations. First, we identify all ways in which the set of RCC8 base relations can be restricted to guarantee that consistent networks can be convexly realized in respectively 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D. Most surprisingly, we find that if the relation \u2018partially overlaps\u2019 is disallowed, all consistent atomic RCC8 networks can be convexly realized in 4D. If instead refinements of the relation \u2018part of\u2019 are disallowed, all consistent atomic RCC8 relations can be convexly realized in 3D. We furthermore show, among others, that any consistent RCC8 network with 2n + 1 variables can be realized using convex regions in the n-dimensional Euclidean space.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
