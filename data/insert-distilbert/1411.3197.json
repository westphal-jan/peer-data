However, it is hard to estimate this cost accurately, and there is a penalty associated with both under-estimation and over-estimation. The under-estimation can cause shortage of failed components in the market, leading to customer dissatisfaction and can diminish brand-name of the company. While, over-estimation has high opportunity cost from the financial perspective. It is therefore very important for manufacturing companies to predict warranty cost accurately. The warranty cost estimates usually depends on three factors: 1) number of warrant-able items, 2) failure rate analysis, and 3) cost per failure, where failure rate analysis plays a significant role in estimation of the warranty cost [4].\nMost of the existing studies use past part-failure data of components to learn the failure rate parameters corresponding to probability distributions like Weibull, log-normal, etc.[2]. However, more information is available in enterprises, which can be fused with the past part-failure data in order to improve the accuracy of estimation of these parameters, which results in better estimates of failures. The warranty cost is the product of part replacement cost and estimated failures in the warranty period. So better estimate of failures leads to a better estimate of warranty cost. For example in an automotive company, service ar X\niv :1\n41 1.\n31 97\nv1 [\ncs .A\nI] 1\n1 N\nov 2\n01 4\nstations data and tele-diagnostics data is available (we describe these datasets in Section 1.1). These datasets, when fused with past part-failure data, can work as a leading indicator of part failure and thereby help improve the warranty cost estimates.\nFusion of such data from multiple sources is a non-trivial problem because occurrence of symptoms in vehicle service data or in tele-diagnostics data does not entail part-failure. However, there is a conditional dependence of such symptoms on the part-failure rate. This degree of conditional dependence may change over time with sales of newer models of the product and change in number of product units sold, as a result the conditional dependence cannot be learned statically once, and used later. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model for fusion of data from multiple sources using an approach based on Bayesian Network, which can learn the conditional dependency of symptom data on part-failure rate, resulting in improvement of failure estimates, hence better warranty cost. In addition we indicate how the optimum warranty period can be computed. We also substantiate our claims through empirical results on simulated data, which has been inspired from real-life data.\nIn this paper, we begin by giving an overview of our approach, after a brief description of various datasets involved, in the immediate next section. After that in section 2, we present formal definitions of the data and other terminologies used in rest of the paper, and in section 3 we give an introduction to Bayesian networks and how parameter estimation can be done in Bayesian Networks. We start describing our approach by introducing the proposed Bayesian Network, which is used to learn dependencies between part failure and symptom data, in Section 4. Later, in section 5, we present our approach of warranty cost estimation in detail. We summarize the empirical results in Section 6 and discussed the related work in Section 7. Finally, we conclude with a brief discussion on future work in Section 8."}, {"heading": "1.1 Overview", "text": "To give an overview of our approach to predict warranty cost estimation in multi-component products with better accuracy, we use the example of vehicles as multi-component products in this section.\nConsumers take their vehicles to a service station to get it examined by service engineers, who record DTCs (diagnosed trouble codes) [3] for every trouble symptom observed in the vehicle. The vehicles are taken to the service station either because of failure of a component or on regular service routine. Further, in many cases before failure of a part, a trouble symptom occurs in the vehicle, and such trouble symptoms are also observed during service of a vehicle. Although, these trouble symptoms are fixed in the vehicle by the service engineers through incidental preventive maintenance, this information can also be used as a leading indicator for part-failure.\nFurther, usually these DTCs can be observed only when the vehicle is examined by service engineers at the service station. However, the modern vehicles [5]\nare equipped with sensors, which not only observe the state of various components but also transmit this information, intermittently or regularly, to a central hub for offline analysis. Researchers are trying to build algorithms to predict part-failure from such sensor data [5], [19] and these methods are referred as tele-diagnostics. In this paper we consider that if the tele-diagnostics data were available, how can we fused it with the past part-failure data, in order to improve the warranty cost estimates. In contrast, the traditional approach is to find expected number of failure using past part-failure data [2] only, we present a novel approach which captures the dependencies in a Bayesian network and uses these dependencies to predict expected number of future part failures with better accuracy.\nTraditionally, failure rate parameter(s) estimation has been done componentwise i.e. considering whole component as one unit. However, as each component can further be divided into sub-components or more granular levels, i.e., part wise. Considering the fact that each part can have different failure rate, learning the failure rate parameter(s) on granular level rather than on component level can enhance the accuracy of prediction.\nIn our approach we model a simple Bayesian network (F \u2192 I \u2192 S), following a process that when a part fails (F ), a trouble symptom in terms of DTC (I) occurs in the vehicle, and the drivers takes the vehicle to service station where the DTC is diagnosed or observed (S). Here, a DTC may occur before partfailure, but it is not observed until the vehicle is taken to the service station. A DTC will definitely occur when a part in the vehicle fails. A vehicle could be taken to the service station because of vehicle service routine or due to failure of a part. So the occurrence time of DTC can be much early than the observed time of DTC. we model the F node using Weibull distribution, and the I and S nodes using Gaussian distribution. The parameters of these distributions defines the dependency between the nodes F , I, and S. The Bayesian network to learn dependencies between F , I, and S for each part and and related DTC is presented in section 4 and the detail approach to learn the dependencies and further use these dependencies to predict expected number of failures is presented in section 5.2."}, {"heading": "2 Data Description", "text": "We consider data for the time duration t1 to t2 for n products indexed from 1 to n, where each product has m parts.

In next section, we will present our Bayesian Network which is used to learn the dependency between part failure and DTCs.\nA Bayesian network is a representation of joint probability distribution. This representation consists of two components. The first component G is a directed acyclic graph whose vertices correspond to random variables X1, X2, ..., Xn. The second component, \u03b8 describes a conditional distribution for each variable, given its parent G. Together these two components specify a unique distribution on X1, X2, ..., Xn. The graph G encodes the independence assumption, by which variable Xi is independent of its nondescendents given its parents in G [1], [8].\nBy applying the chain rule of probabilities and properties of conditional independence, and joint probability distribution that satisfies Marcov assumptions can be decomposed into the product form\nP (X1, X2, ..., Xn) = n\u220f i=1 P (Xi | PaG(Xi)) (7)\nwhere PaG(Xi) is the set of parents of Xi in G. The parameters of Bayesian network can be learned using various methods like Maximum-likelihood estimation, EM, MCMC etc. Different methods to learn the parameters of Bayesian Network can be classified based on two factors: 1) Observability of network, i.e., All nodes are known or not, 2) Bayesian structure is known or not [1]."}, {"heading": "4 Modeling Dependence Using Bayesian Networks", "text": "As discussed in section 1, DTCs which occur before the actual part failure can be used as the leading indicators of part failure.

Estimation of expected number of failures can be improved by incorporating additional information like tele-diagnostic data and service records. The Bayesian network explained in section 4, models the dependency between part failure data, occurrence time of DTC, and observed time of DTC. In this section, we present three cases and approach to find an expected number of failures using Bayesian networks in each case. Figure 2 shows which datasets are used in different cases. In first case, we use only part failure data to do the failure rate analysis. In second case, we use part failure data and service records and in third case, we use part failure data, service records, and sensor data to do failure rate analysis. Comparison of these three cases will presented in section 7. Three cases and their corresponding approaches, used to find expected number of failure of part Pj associated with DTC Dj,k in each case is presented below:\nCase 1: In this case, we use only part failure data for failure rate analysis. Using the Bayesian network (in section 4), we learn the parameters \u03b1j , \u03b2j for the part Pj . While learning these parameters, variable Fj is considered as known with values taken from the set Failj and other variables Ij,k and Sj,k, Rj,k, \u03c3 1 j,k, Mj,k, \u03c3 2 j,k are considered as unknown. Once we learned the\n\u03b1j , \u03b2j , we use these parameters to predict expected number of failures for\npart Pj \u2200 j = 1 to m as explained in section 5.\nCase 2: In this case, we present an approach that incorporates part failure data and service records to find expected number of failures using our Bayesian network (explained in section 4). Fig 3 explains, which variables are considered as known or unknown during which step i.e. O: observed or N.O: Not observed ( steps are explained below) and in case of known variable, the value of that variable is taken from which set. For example O: Failj means that variable is considered as known in this step and it\u2019s value is taken from the set Failj and O: step 1 mens that value is known and taken as value learned in step 1 . This approach has four steps which are explained below:\nStep 1 - Learning dependency parameters: In this step, we learn the parameters Rj,k, \u03c3 1 j,k, Mj,k, \u03c3 2 j,k using our Bayesian network, that\ncaptures the dependency between part Pj and DTC Dj,k. While learning these parameters by our Bayesian network( fig 1), variable Fj and Sj are considered as known with values taken from the sets Failj and Servj,k respectively and variable Ij , Rj,k, \u03c3 1 j,k, Mj,k, \u03c3 2 j,k, \u03b1j , \u03b2j are considered\nas unknown. Step 2 - Predicting future failures: In this step, we predict those fail-\nures of part Pj , in which the part fails after time t2 but associated DTC Dj,k occurs and observed in the time interval [t1, t2]. To predict these failures, we use the parameters that are learned in previous step. While predicting these failures from our Bayesian network, Rj,k, \u03c3 1 j,k, Mj,k, and \u03c32j,k considered as known with values learned in previous step, value of Sj,k is also considered as known with values taken from the set Serv \u2032\nj,k\n(6). All the failures of part Pj that are predicted using this step forms a set called Fail \u2032\nj,k.\nStep 3 - Learning Weibull parameters: In this step, we learn the scale \u03b2j and shape \u03b1 parameters using our Bayesian network. To learn these\nparameters, first we take union of two sets Failj (1) and Fail \u2032\nj,k (using previous step).\nFail \u2032\u2032 j,k = Failj \u222a Fail \u2032 j,k (18)\nServ \u2032\u2032 j,k = Servj,k \u222a Serv \u2032 j,k (19)\nIt is to be noted that Failj \u2229 Fail \u2032 j,k = \u2205 and Servj,k \u2229 Serv \u2032\nj,k = \u2205 While learning scale and shape parameters from our Bayesian network, variables Sj,k and Fj is considered as known with values taken from the sets Serv \u2032\u2032\nj,k and Fail \u2032\u2032 j,k respectively and other variables Ij , Rj,k, \u03c3 1 j,k,\nMj,k, \u03c3 2 j,k, \u03b1j , \u03b2j are considered as unknown.

Fig 4 explains that which variables are considered as known or unknown i.e. O: observed or N.O: Not observed during which step ( steps explained in case 2) and in case of known variable, the value of that variable is taken from what set is given in fig 4.

The parameters learnt are then used to predict the number of part failures in the year 2013. The data simulation details for part failure data, sensor data and service records are as follows:\nPart failure data: To generate part failure data, we assume that number of miles before failure for a part Pj follows Weibull distribution with shape and scale parameters \u03b1j and \u03b2j , respectively, where j \u2208 {1, 2, ..., 9}. Number of miles at which Pj fails is generated using inverse transform sampling method [11]. Sensor data: We make the following assumptions to generate sensor data: 1. Each part is associated with four DTCs and no two parts have any DTC\nin common. 2. When a part fails, all four DTCs associated with it occur. Also, one or\nmore DTCs associated with the part may occur before the actual part fails. 3. Number of miles at which DTCs associated with a part occur before the actual part failure is generated assuming the probability distribution N (f \u2212 f \u00d7 r, \u03c31) (refer Section 4), where f is number of miles at which part fails and r \u2208 (0.1, 0.5).

We also compare the results with the Best Scenario where we use the same approach to find expected number of failures as explained in Case 3 with the exception that we skip the step 1 of Case 3. Also, in step 2, rather than predicting\nthe failures we form the set Fail \u2032\nj with the actual future failures as present in the simulated data. Steps 3 and 4 are the same as in the case 3. Best scenario assumes that for the given service records and sensor data, our Bayesian network model can predict actual number of miles for every failure.\nIn Fig 5, first column lists the names of nine parts. In column \u2018Actual parameters\u2019, we have shown the scale and shape parameters used to simulate part failure data for each part. We compare these actual parameters with the parameters learned from our model using three different approaches in Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3 (in section 6). Fig 5 shows that the difference in the parameters learned using Case 1 (using only part failure data) and actual parameters is very high for three parts named as E2P, T1P, and T2P. This is due to insufficient number of failures of these parts before 31-Dec-12. i.e. number of samples in set Failj for these three parts are not sufficient to learn parameters accurately. However, column \u2018Parameters learned using Case 2\u2019 in Fig 5 shows that when we use the approach discussed in Case 2 the values of the parameters for these three parts have improved. Similarly, when we use the approach discussed in Case 3, values of parameters for these three parts further improved. Also, the values of the parameters learned using Case 1 for the parts E1P, E3P, T3P, B1P, B2P, and B3P are close to the actual values. There is small improvement in the parameters learned using Case 2 and Case 3 for the parts E1P, T3P, and B3P. Values of the parameters learned using Case 2 and Case 3 for the parts E3P, B1P, and B2P do not change. This is due to the reason that Serv \u2032\nj,k = \u2205 and Ind \u2032\nj,k = \u2205 for these parts (Section 5.2). Column \u2018Best Scenario\u2019 shows the values of scale and shape parameters learned for four parts using Best scenario case as explained above.\nFig 6 shows the comparison of expected number of failures for the year 2013, calculated for four parts E1P, E2P, T2P, and T1P for the Cases 1-3 and the best scenario. It shows that the difference in actual failures and expected number of failures calculated using Case 1 is high for the parts E2P, T1P, and T2P. This difference reduces when using Case 2, and reduces further when using Case 3.\nFig 7 shows the optimal warranty period for each part calculated using parameters learned in Case 3(as explained in section 5.3). Values of coefficients b and c (in eq 20) are taken as e (2.71828) and 1/100000 respectively. The value of b is taken in such a way that the penalty for the parts which fails at early stage is higher than the replacement cost of the part and value of c is taken by the assumption that a car runs roughly 100000 miles in three years. The penalty cost is high for small value of w (warranty period) and gets decreases with time. We observe that warranty period is directly proportional to the scale parameter of part. Since we have not made any assumptions about the relative costs of parts, i.e. the Ri (in eq 20), we have not computed the single optimal period as that would depend heavily on this relative cost. However, with the assumption that slower failing parts (higher \u03b1) cost more, the overall optimal period will be skewed towards the more expensive parts."}, {"heading": "7 Related Work", "text": "There are many studies which use statistical methods to integrate datasets from different sources, leveraging the interaction and correlation between them to obtain more refined information. In [17], joint likelihood model is used to combine gene expression and upstream sequence data for finding significant gene clusters. Similarly in [18], maximum likelihood method to predict protein-protein interactions and protein functions from three type of data. A kernel based data fusion is presented in [16]. In this paper, we propose a model for fusion of data from multiple sources such as part failure data, tele-diagnostic data, service records using an approach based on Bayesian Network, which can learn the conditional dependency of symptom data on part-failure rate, resulting in improvement of warranty cost prediction accuracy. We also substantiate our claims through empirical results on simulated data, which has been inspired from real-life data. Bayesian Network has many real-world applications [15]. In [8], Bayesian networks are used to analyze expression data. Similarly for cardiogenic heart failures, a continous time bayesian network model is presented in [12]. Our approach based on Bayesian network has an application in warranty cost estimation of multi-component product family. We learn the dependence of symptom on part failure and predict number of future part failures with better accuracy.\nMany studies use historical failure data to predict future failures in many studies [2], [14]. In [15] historical repair data is used to predict failure curves using Weibull distribution. In this paper, we propose an approach to use additional information like service records and tele-diagnostic data along with historical failure data to predict expected number of future failures with better accuracy."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "We have proposed an approach for fusion of information from diverse sources that can be used to enhance the accuracy of warranty cost estimates. We also described how our approach learns the dependencies of symptoms, gleaned from multiple sources of information, on actual failure rate of the parts. We have also shown that predicting future failures using these dependencies can help in better estimation of warranty costs. We have tested our approach on simulated data for the vehicles having past part-failure data and data from service stations and tele-diagnostics. We have shown that our approach can capture the information provided by the leading indicators and can predict future failures with better accuracy. Further, it was shown that our estimate of part-failure from symptom data is almost equal to actual part-failures, through comparison with the best case scenario. Hence, we conclude that failure rate analysis can be improved using service records and sensor data along with past part-failure data, using our approach.\nIn future, we plan to enhance the proposed model by incorporating more information such as geographical variations (hilly or plains areas) and seasonal variations. Currently, our model can predict expected number of failures with\nbetter accuracy as compared to traditional approach, which uses only part failure data. A possible next step our work is to extend our model to a framework that is capable of suggesting preventive maintenance in order to optimize the warranty cost. Also, the model needs to be tested on actual real-world datasets."}], "references": [{"title": "An introduction to Bayesian networks", "author": ["Jensen", "Finn V"], "venue": "Vol. 210.
