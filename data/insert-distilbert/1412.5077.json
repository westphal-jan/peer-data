Introduction", "text": "The concept of neutrosophic set (NS) developed by Smarandache ([1,2]) is a more general platform which extends the concepts of the classic set and fuzzy set ([3]), intuitionistic fuzzy set ([4]) and interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets ([5]). In contrast to intuitionistic fuzzy sets and also interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets, the indeterminacy is characterized explicitly in a neutrosophic set. A neutrosophic set has three basic components such that truth membership \ud835\udc47, indeterminacy membership \ud835\udc3c and falsity membership \ud835\udc39, which are defined independently of one another. But, a neutrosophic set will be more difficult to apply in real scientific and engineering fields. Therefore, Wang et al. ([6,7]) proposed the concepts of single valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) and interval neutrosophic set (INS) which are an instance of a neutrosophic set, and provided the set-theoretic operators and various properties of SVNSs and INSs. SVNSs present uncertainty, imprecise, inconsistent and incomplete information existing in real world. Also, it would be more suitable to handle indeterminate information and inconsistent information.\nWe usually need the decision making methods because of the uncertainty and complex under the\nphysical nature of the problems. By the multi-criteria decision making methods, we can determine the best alternative from multiple alternatives with respect to some criteria. Recently, supplier selection has become increasingly important in both academia and industry (see [8-12]). So there are many MCDM techniques developed for the supplier selection problem. Some of these techniques are categorical method, weighted point method ([13]), matrix approach ([14]), vendor performance matrix approach ([15]) vendor profile analysis (VPA) ([16]) analytic hierarchy process (AHP) ([17-19]), analytic network process (ANP) ([20]), mathematical programming ([21,22]) and multiple objective programming (MOP) ([23-25]). However, most of these methods are developed with respect to crisp data and so they have not several influence factors such as imprecision preferences, additional qualitative criteria and incomplete information. Therefore, fuzzy set theory (FST) is more appropriate to overcome problems in decision making process.\nLi et al. ([26]) and Holt ([27]) proposed the application of supplied selection under fuzzy data.\nChen et al. ([28]) extended the concept of classic\n2 Keywords: Neutrosophic sets, single valued neutrosophic sets, TOPSIS method, multi-criteria decision making, distance measure\nTOPSIS method to solve supplier selection problems\nin fuzzy set theory.\nTOPSIS (Technique for order preference by\nsimilarity to an ideal solution) method which is one\nof the most used classical MCDM methods has\ndeveloped by Hwang and Yoon ([29]). Then the\nproposed set theories have provided the different\nmulti-criteria decision making methods. Some\nauthors ([30-41]) studied on multi-criteria decision-\nmaking methods based fuzzy data. Boran et al. ([41])\nproposed the TOPSIS method to select appropriate\nsupplier under intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Then\nthe TOPSIS method for MCDM problem has\nextended in interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets by\nYe ([42]).\nAs mentioned above, the single valued neutrosophic\ninformation is a generalization of intuitionistic fuzzy\ninformation, while intuitionistic fuzzy information is\ngeneralizes the fuzzy information. On one hand, a\nsingle valued neutrosophic set is an instance of\nneutrosophic set, which give us an additional\npossibility to represent uncertainty, imprecise,\nincomplete, and inconsistent information existing in\nreal world. It can describe and handle indeterminate\ninformation and inconsistent information. However,\nthe connector in the fuzzy set is defined with respect\nto T, i.e. membership only, hence the information of\nindeterminacy and non-membership is lost. The\nconnectors in the intuitionistic fuzzy set are defined\nwith respect to T and F, i.e. membership and non-\nmembership only, hence the indeterminacy is what is\nleft from 1, while in the neutrosophic set, they can be\ndefined by any of them (no restriction) ([1]). For\nexample, when we ask the opinion of an expert about\ncertain statement, one may say that the possibility in which the statement is true is 0.6, the statement is false is 0.5 and the statement is not sure is 0.2. For\nneutrosophic notation, it can be expressed as \ud835\udc65(0.6,0.2,0.5). For further example, suppose there\nare 10 voters during a voting process. Five vote \u201caye\u201d,\ntwo vote \u201cblackball\u201d and three vote are undecided.\nFor neutrosophic notation, it can be characterized as \ud835\udc65(0.5,0.3,0.2). However, the expression are beyond\nthe scope of the intuitionistic fuzzy set. Therefore, the\nconcept of single valued neutrosophic set is more\ngeneral structure and very suitable to overcome the\nmentioned issues. Then we say that the TOPSIS\nmethod under single valued neutrosophic environment is suitable for decision making.\nMoreover, the single valued neutrosophic TOPSIS\nnot only use for single valued neutrosophic\ninformation, but also extends the intuitionistic fuzzy\nTOPSIS and the fuzzy TOPSIS.\nBut, until now there have been no many studies on\nmulti criteria decision making methods which are\ncriterion values for alternatives are single valued\nneutrosophic sets. Ye ([43]) presented the correlation\ncoefficient of SVNSs and the cross-entropy measure\nof SVNSs and applied them to single valued\nneutrosophic decision-making problems. Also Ye\n([44]) defined single valued neutrosophic cross\nentropy which is proposed as an extension of the cross\nentropy of fuzzy sets, Recently, Zhang et al. ([46])\nestablished two interval neutrosophic aggregation\noperators such as interval neutrosophic weighted\narithmetic operator and interval neutrosophic\nweighted geometric operator and presented a method\nfor multi criteria decision making problems based on\nthe aggregation operators.\nThe main purposes of this paper were (1) to define\none equation to calculate performance weights of\ndecision makers expressed by single valued\nneutrosophic numbers (2) to establish a multi criteria\ndecision making method based on TOPSIS method\nunder single valued neutrosophic values for supplier\nselection, (3) to show the application and\neffectiveness of the proposed method with an\nexample, and (4) to present performances of\nalternatives according to each criterion via graphics\nvisualizing the relationships among alternatives, SVN\npositive ideal solution and SVN negative ideal\nsolution.\nWe organize the rest of the paper as follows: in the\nfollowing section, we give preliminary definitions of\nneutrosophic sets and single valued neutrosophic sets\nand propose a score function for ranking SVN\nnumbers.

Then we discuss the using TOPSIS method in solving MCDM problems. We give the relationships between linguistic variables and single valued neutrosophic numbers.\nThe TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method was initiated by Hwang and Yoon ([29]). It is very suitable practical method which is one of the methods of the multicriteria decision making. In practice, the TOPSIS method is a process of determining the alternative which is closest to the ideal solution, i.e. ranking the alternatives with respect to their distances from the ideal and the negative ideal solution and has applied to many areas relying on computer support to overcome evaluation problems under a finite number of alternatives. In this method, the grades of options are determined according to ideal solution similarity. If the similarity rate of an option is more close to an ideal solution which is the best from any aspect that does not exist practically, it has a higher grade and also is the optimal choice.\nA linguistic variable is a variable whose values are characterized with words or sentences instead of numbers in a natural or artificial language. The value of a linguistic variable is expressed as an element of its term set. The concept of a linguistic variable is very useful for solving decision making problems with complex content. For example, we can express the performance ratings of alternatives on qualitative attributes by linguistic variables such as very important, important, medium, unimportant, very unimportant, etc. Such linguistic values can be represented using single valued neutrosophic numbers. For example, \u2018important\u2019 and \u2018very important\u2019 can be expressed by single valued neutrosophic numbers (0.2, 0.3, 0.5) and (0.6, 0.9, 1.0), respectively.\nFundamentally, linguistic terms are individual variations for a linguistic variable. That is, linguistic terms do not meet precise meaning and it may be interpreted differently by different people. The cover of a determined term are pretty subjective and it may vary as the case. Therefore, linguistic terms cannot be indicated by classic set theory and also each linguistic term is associated with a single valued neutrosophic set. The following example illustrates that situation.\nExample 10. Let \ud835\udc4b = {\ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652, \ud835\udc653, \ud835\udc654, \ud835\udc655} be five alternatives in the universe of cars. Suppose that \u2018\u2018quality of the cars\u2019\u2019 is a linguistic variable and\n\ud835\udc47(price) = {extremely high, very high, medium, very low} is set of linguistic terms for this variable. Since each linguistic term is characterized with its own single valued neutrosophic set, two of them might be defined as follows:\n\ud835\udc47very high = { (\ud835\udc651, 0.5,0.7,0,4), (\ud835\udc652, 0.1,0.3,0,4), (\ud835\udc654, 0.5,0.4,0,1), (\ud835\udc655, 0.3,0.3,0,5) }\n\ud835\udc47medium = { (\ud835\udc651, 0.2,0.4,0,6), (\ud835\udc653, 0.3,0.1,0,5), (\ud835\udc654, 0.2,0.4,0,7), (\ud835\udc655, 0.4,0.1,0,6) }\nSupplier selection has a very important place in multi\ncriteria decision making. In our supplier selection\napproach, we firstly collect the individual evaluations\nof multiple decision makers and then we decide for a final select. In the method, there are \ud835\udc58-decision makers, \ud835\udc5a-alternatives and \ud835\udc5b-criteria. \ud835\udc58-decision makers evaluate the importance of the \ud835\udc5a alternatives under \ud835\udc5b criteria and rank the performance of the \ud835\udc5b\ncriteria with respect to linguistic statements converted\ninto single valued neutrosophic numbers. Here, the\ndecision makers utilize often a set of weights such that \ud835\udc4a ={very important, important, medium,\nunimportant, very unimportant} and the importance\nweights based on single valued neutrosophic values\nof the linguistic terms is given as Table 1.\nMoreover, in Table 2, we give the set of linguistic terms used to rate the importance of alternatives according to decision makers.\nTable 2.

By aggregating the criteria values and the weight values of decision makers for the importance of each criteria, we can obtain the weights of the criteria. Assume that weights of criteria is denoted by \ud835\udc4a = (\ud835\udc641, \ud835\udc642, \u2026 , \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5b) where \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc57 indicates the relative importance of criterion \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc57.

To construct the aggregated weighted SVN decision matrix, we use the Eq. (11) and give it in Table 11.\nStep 5. Calculation SVN positive-ideal solution and SVN negative-ideal solution.\nBy using Eq. (12) and Eq. (13), SVN positive-ideal solution and SVN negative-ideal solution were calculated as Table 13.\nStep 6. Calculate the separation measures.\nSeparation measure of each alternative from the positive-ideal solution and negative ideal solution are calculated using Eq. (14) and Eq. (15) and are given by Table 14.\nAccording to descending order of relative closeness coefficients values, four alternatives are ranked as \ud835\udf0c1 > \ud835\udf0c3 > \ud835\udf0c5 > \ud835\udf0c2 > \ud835\udf0c4 as in Table 14. Then, the alternative \ud835\udf0c1 is also the most desirable alternative.\nFrom the example, we can see that the proposed neutrosophic decision-making method is more suitable for real scientific and engineering applications because it can handle not only incomplete information but also the inconsistent information and indeterminate information existing in real world. The technique proposed in this paper extends existing decision making methods and provides a new viewpoint for multi criteria group decision making.\nThe TOPSIS method is a very important technical for the process of multi criteria decision making. There are many TOPSIS methods for solving multi criteria decision making problems with the fuzzy information\nand its extension, the intuitionistic fuzzy information and the interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy information. Since the single valued neutrosophic sets generalize the concepts of fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets, the existing TOPSIS methods is not suitable for handling the single valued neutrosophic information including unknown weights of decision makers and the criteria values for alternatives. Therefore, we need to extend the method to neutrosophic environment. The developed decision making method can utilize the proposed score function of single valued neutrosophic numbers to rank alternatives in the process of multi criteria decision making. The performance ratings of decision makers and criteria on alternatives are characterized by linguistic variables. The weights of decision makers are calculated via a developed equation while the weights of the criteria are obtained by aggregating the criteria values provided by decision makers and the weight values of decision makers for the importance of each criteria. The method proposed in this paper are general and more flexible than existing decision making methods."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we extended TOPSIS method that is one\nof the familiar methods in multi-attribute decision-\nmaking problem in single valued neutrosophic sets\nand proposed a multi-criteria group decision making\nbased on single valued neutrosophic TOPSIS for\nevaluation of supplier. Since to solve a decision\nmaking problem expressed by crisp data is more\ndifficult under uncertain environment, single valued\nneutrosophic sets are more useful to overcome such\nsituations. In the evaluation process, weights of\ndecision makers, the aggregation of the criteria and\nthe impact of alternatives on criteria with respect to\ndecision makers is very important to appropriately\nperform evaluation process. In order to do that, the\nratings of each alternative according to each criterion\nand the weights of each criterion were provided as\nlinguistic terms expressed by single valued\nneutrosophic numbers. Also SVNWA operator is\nutilized to aggregate all individual decision makers\u2019\nopinions for determining the importance of criteria\nand the alternatives. Firstly, single valued\nneutrosophic positive-ideal solution and single\nvalued neutrosophic negative-ideal solution were\nobtained using the Euclidean distance. Then the\nrelative closeness coefficients of alternatives were calculated and finally ranking the alternatives was\ndone.\n9 Keywords: Neutrosophic sets, single valued neutrosophic sets, TOPSIS method, multi-criteria decision making, distance measure\nTOPSIS method based on single valued neutrosophic\nset is more useful for solving multi-criteria decision-\nmaking problems because of considering order of\nimportance of decision makers. So, the single valued\nneutrosophic TOPSIS can be preferable for dealing\nwith incomplete, indetermine and inconsistent\ninformation in MCDM problems such as selecting\nproject and personnel, selecting a flexible\nmanufacturing system and many further areas of\nmarketing research problems and management\ndecision problems.\nThe relationships among the alternatives and their\npositive-ideal solution and negative ideal solution is\npresented in Fig. (1-5)."}], "references": [{"title": "A unifying field in logics.

alternatives. The problem of supplier selection on which decision maker has usually vague and imprecise knowledge is a typical example of multi criteria group decision-making problem. The conventional crisp techniques has not much effective for solving MCDM problems because of imprecise or fuzziness nature of the linguistic assessments. To find the exact values for MCDM problems is both difficult and impossible in more cases in real world. So, it is more reasonable to consider the values of alternatives according to the criteria as single valued neutrosophic sets (SVNS). This paper deal with the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach and extend the TOPSIS method to MCDM problem with single valued neutrosophic information. The value of each alternative and the weight of each criterion are characterized by single valued neutrosophic numbers. Here, the importance of criteria and alternatives is identified by aggregating individual opinions of decision makers (DMs) via single valued neutrosophic weighted averaging (IFWA) operator. The proposed method is, easy use, precise and practical for solving MCDM problem with single valued neutrosophic data. Finally, to show the applicability of the developed method, a numerical experiment for supplier choice is given as an application of single valued neutrosophic TOPSIS method at end of this paper.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
