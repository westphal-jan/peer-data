INTRODUCTION\nThe problem of tracking and monitoring targets using position-fixed sensors is relevant to a variety of applications, including monitoring of moving targets using cameras [], tracking anomalies in manufacturing plants [1], and tracking of endangered species [2]\u2013[4]. The position-fixed sensor is deployed to measure targets based on limited information that only becomes available when the target enters the sensor\u2019s field-of-view (FOV) or visibility region [5]. The sensor\u2019s FOV is defined as a compact subset of the region of interest, in which the sensor can obtain measurements from the targets. In many such sensor applications, filter techniques are often required to estimate unknown variables of interest, for examples, target number and target state.\nWhen the noise in the measurement model is an additive Gaussian distribution, the target state can be estimated from frequent observation sequence using a Kalman filter [6]. This approach is well suited to longrange high-accuracy sensors, such as radars, and to moving targets with a known dynamical model and initial conditions. However, most of these underlying\nThe author H. Li is with Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, 310014, P.R.China . Email: zgdlhj@zjut.edu.cn.\nassumptions are violated in modern applications, because the targets\u2019 motion models are unknown, and, possibly, random and nonlinear. Also, due to the use of low-cost passive sensors, measurement errors and noise may be non-additive and non-Gaussian. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) can be used when the system dynamics are nonlinear, but can be linearized about nominal operating conditions [7]. An unscented Kalman filter (UKF) method, based on the unscented transformation (UT) method, can be applied to compute the mean and covariance of a function up to the second order of the Taylor expansion [8].\nHowever, the efficiency of these filters decreases significantly when the system dynamics are highly nonlinear or unknown, and when the measurement noise are non-Gaussian. Recently, a non-parametric method based on condensation and Monte Carlo simulation, known as a particle filter, has been proposed for tracking multiple targets exhibiting nonlinear dynamics and non-Gaussian random effects [9]. Particle filters are well suited to modern surveillance systems because they can be applied to Bayesian models in which the hidden variables are connected by a Markov chain in discrete time. In the classical particle filter method, a weighted set of particles or point masses are used to represent the probability density function (PDF) of the target state by means of a superposition of weighted Dirac delta functions. At each iteration of the particle filter, particles representing possible target state values are sampled from a proposal distribution [10]. The weight associated with each particle is then obtained from the target-state likelihood function, and from the prior estimation of the target state PDF. When the effective particle size is smaller than a predefined threshold, a re-sampling technique can be implemented [11]. One disadvantage of classical particle-filtering techniques is that the target-state transition function is used as the importance density function to sample particles, without taking new observations into account [12]. Recently, an particle filter with Mixture Gaussian representation was proposed by author for monitoring maneuvering targets [13], where the particles are sampled based on the supporting intervals of the target-state likelihood function and the prior estimation function of the target state. In this case, the supporting interval of a distribution is defined as the 90% confidence ar X iv :1 50 1. 02 41 1v 1 [ cs .L G\n] 1\n1 Ja\nn 20\n15\n2 interval [14]. The weight for each particle is obtained by considering the likelihood function and the transition function simultaneously. Then, the weighted expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is implemented to use the sampled weighted particles to generate a normal mixture model of the distribution.\nKreucher proposed joint multitarget probability density (JMPD) [15] to estimate the number of total targets in workspace and their state, where targets are moving. By using JMPD, the data association problem is avoided, however, the JMPD results in a joint state space, the dimension of which is the dimension of a target state times number of total targets. Since the number of total targets is unknown, the joint space size remain unavailable. To overcome this problem, it is assumed the number of total targets has a maximum value. Therefore, when the maximum number of targets is large, the joint state space becomes intractable.\nInspired by [16], this paper presents a novel filter technique which combines Kalman filter and particle filter for estimating the number and state of total targets based on the measurement obtained online. The estimation is represented by a set of weighted particles, different from classical particle filter, where each particle is a Gaussian instead of a point mass. The weight of each particle represents the probability of existing a target, while its gaussian indicates the state distribution for this target. More importantly, the update of particles is different from classical particle filter. For each particle, the gaussian parameters are updated based using Kalman filter given a measurement. To overcome the data association problem, in this paper, when one particle is updated, the other particles are considered as the measurement condition, which will be explained in Section IV. The novel Gaussian particle filter technique requires less particles than classical particle filters, and can solve multiple target estimation problem without increasing the state space dimensions.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the multiple targets estimation problem formulation and assumptions. The background on the particle filter and Kalman filter is reviewed in Section III. Section IV presents the Gaussian Particle filter technique. The method is demonstrated through numerical simulations and results, presented in Section V. Conclusions and future work are described in Section VI."}, {"heading": "II.

Particle Filter Methods", "text": "The particle filter is a recursive model estimation method based on sequential Monte Carlo Simulations. Because of their recursive nature, particle filters are easily applicable to online data processing and variable inference. More importantly, it is applicable to nonlinear system dynamics with non-Gaussian noises. The PDF functions are represented with properly weighted and relocated point-mass, known as particles. These particles are sampled from an importance density that is crucial to the particle filter algorithm and is also referred to as a proposal distribution. Let {x\u03baj,p, w\u03baj,p}Np=1 denote the weighted particles that are used to approximate the posterior PDF f(x\u03baj | Z\u03baj ) for the jth target at t\u03ba, where Z\u03baj = {z0j , . . . , z\u03baj } denotes the set of all measurements obtained by sensor i, from target j, up to t\u03ba. Then, the posterior probability density function of the target state, given the measurement at t\u03ba can be modeled as,\nf(x\u03baj | Z\u03baj ) = N\u2211 p=1 w\u03baj,p\u03b4(x \u03ba j,p), N\u2211 p=1 w\u03baj,p = 1 (5)\nwhere w\u03baj,p is non-negative and \u03b4 is the Dirac delta function. The techniques always consist of the recursive\n3 propagation of the particles and the particle weights. In each iteration, the particles x\u03baj,p are sampled from the importance density q(x). Then, weight wkj,p is updated for each particle by\nw\u03baj,p \u221d p(x\u03baj,p)\nq(x\u03baj,p) (6)\nwhere p(x\u03baj,p) \u221d f(x\u03baj,p | Z\u03baj ). Additionally, the weights are normalized at the end of each iteration.\nOne common drawback of particle filters is the degeneracy phenomenon [12], i.e., the variance of particle weights accumulates along iterations. A common way to evaluate the degeneracy phenomenon is the effective sample size Ne [11], obtained by,\nNe = 1\u2211N\np=1(w \u03ba j,p)\n2 (7)\nwhere w\u03baj,p, p = 1, 2, . . . , N are the normalized weights. In general, a re-sampling procedure is taken when Ne < Ns, where Ns is a predefined threshold, and is usually set as N2 . Let {x \u03ba j,p, w \u03ba j,p}Np=1 denote the particle set that needs to be re-sampled, and let {x\u03ba\u2217j,p, w\u03ba\u2217j,p}Np=1 denote the particle set after re-sampling. The main idea of this re-sampling procedure is to eliminate the particles having low weights by re-sampling {x\u03ba\u2217j,p, w\u03ba\u2217j,p}Np=1 from {x\u03baj,p, w\u03baj,p}Np=1 with the probability of p(x\u03ba\u2217j,p = x\u03baj,s) = w \u03ba j,s.

Kalman Filter Methods", "text": "The well known Kalman filter is also a recursive method to estimate system/target state based on a measurement sequence, minimizing the estimation uncertainty. The measurement of the system state with an additive Gaussian noise are given by the sensor. Then, in each iteration, the Kalman filter consists of two precesses: i) it predicts the system state and their uncertainties; ii) it updates the system state and uncertainties with the measurement that newly becomes available.

METHODOLOGY", "text": "In this paper, a novel Gaussian particle filter technique follows the main idea of particle filter for estimating the number and state of total targets based on the measurement obtained online. Different from classical particle filter, each particle here is a gaussian instead of a point mass. The estimation for number of total targets and their state is presented by a set of weighted particles. The ith particle at time k is denoted as\nP ik = {wik,N (xik|\u00b5ik,\u03a3ik)} (19)\nwhere wi is the probability of existing a target having a state distribution as N(\u00b5,N (xi|\u00b5,\u03a3i)). By this particle definition, the dimensions of the system state remains the same as the dimensions of each individual target. When these particles are available, the estimated number of total targets can be given as T = \u2211Np i=1 wi, where Np is the particle number. Notice that the particle representation is different from classical particle filter, where each particle represents a possible value of system state. The updating of each\n4 particle and total weights are also different from classical particle filter. Kalman filter is used to update each particle, the weight and the distribution. Notice that since the measurement at each time step is conditioned on all the targets in the FOV, while in the classical Kalman filter method one measurement is associated with one target, which means data association problem is avoid. Therefore, the Kalman filter is modified to updated the particles which are coupled by one measurement, and some approximations and assumptions are further needed.\nSimilar to Kalman filters and particle filters, the algorithm proposed in this paper is a recursive method. Assume that at time step k, the measurement zk is available, and the estimation of the system at time step k\u22121 is represented by a particle set, denoted as Pk\u22121 = {P 1k\u22121, P 2k\u22121, . . . , P Np k\u22121}, where Np is the number of all particles. By using the target dynamic function 1, Pk\u22121 can be updated to P\u0303k without using the zk. Due to limit of FOV, only a few particles may have contribution to the measurement. Let PS denote set including the particles lie in the FOV, while let P\u0304 = P\u0303k/PS denote the compensation set. Only the particles in PS are updated. Please Note the size of PS is small. Without generality, assume that PS = {P\u0303 1k , P\u0303 2k , . . . , P\u0303 sk}, where s the number of particles The update of each particle in PS is calculated separately.

For any E with ej = 1 such that \u03a0(wi)\nei(1 \u2212 wi)1\u2212ei > , where is a predefined threshold, a particle is calculated and denoted as p\u0303j , Then, the modified Kalman filter is used to give the updated gaussian parameters of all particles with ei = 1. According to sensor model 4, the measurement is given by\nzk =\n\u2211s i=1 \u00b5\ni kei\u2211s\ni=1 ei +\n1 ( \u2211s i=1 ei) 2 s\u2211 i=1,i6=j ei\u03a3i+\u03c9k (20)\nCompare the above function to (10), we have following setting\nHk = I \u00d7 1 ( \u2211s i=1 ei)\n(21) zk = zk \u2212 \u2211s i=1,i6=j \u00b5 i kei\u2211s\ni=1 ei (22)\nRk = 1 ( \u2211s i=1 ei) 2 s\u2211 i=1,i6=j ei\u03a3i + \u03c9k (23)\nThen, by applying Kalman procedure\nyk = zk \u2212Hk\u00b5k (24) Sk = Hk\u03a3kH T k + Rk (25)\nKk = \u03a3kH T k S \u22121 k (26)\n\u00b5k = \u00b5k + Kkyk (27) \u03a3k = (I\u2212KkHk)\u03a3k (28)\nIts proof can be found in the appendix. Once each particle appearing in combination E has been updated, the weight wc is for the particle combination E can be obtained by\nwc = \u03a0(wi) ei(1\u2212 wi)1\u2212ei \u00d7\n1\n(2\u03c0)2\u2016\u03a3\u22121c \u2016 \u00d7 exp{\u2212(zk \u2212 \u00b5c)T\u03a3\u22121c (zk \u2212 \u00b5c)} (29)\nwhere c \u2208 IE , where IE is the combination index, and \u00b5c) and \u03a3\u22121c is given by\n\u00b5c = Hk \u2211 \u00b5ik (30)\n\u03a3c = Hk \u2211 \u03a3ikH T k + Rk (31)\nThen, insert particle {N i(\u00b5k,\u03a3k)} into a set Gc for combination c \u2208 IE , the set Gc has a weight wc.

This type of problems is raised in a variety of applications, including monitoring of endangered species, cleaning, and surveillance. Particle filters are widely used to estimate target state from its prior information and its measurements that recently become available, especially for the cases when the measurement model and the prior distribution of state of interest are non-Gaussian. However, the problem of estimating number of total targets and their state becomes intractable when the number of total targets and the measurement-target association are unknown. This paper presents a novel Gaussian particle filter technique that combines Kalman filter and particle filter for estimating the number and state of total targets based on the measurement obtained online. The estimation is represented by a set of weighted particles, different from classical particle filter, where each particle is a Gaussian distribution instead of a point mass.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
