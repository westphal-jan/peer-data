This trend has generated wide interest in linguistic annotations beyond concrete nouns, with the role of adjectives in image descriptions receiving, in particular, much attention.\nAdjectives are of special interest because of their central role in so-called attribute-centric image representations. This framework views objects as bundles of properties, or attributes, commonly expressed by adjectives (e.g., furry, brown), and uses the latter as features to learn higher-level, semantically richer representations of objects (Farhadi et al., 2009).1 Attribute-based methods achieve better generalization of object classifiers with less training data (Lampert et al., 2009), while at the same time producing semantic representations of visual concepts that more accurately model human se-\n1In this paper, we assume that, just like nouns are the linguistic counterpart of visual objects, visual attributes are expressed by adjectives. An informal survey of the relevant literature suggests that, when attributes have linguistic labels, they are indeed mostly expressed by adjectives. There are some attributes, such as parts, that are more naturally expressed by prepositional phrases (PPs: with a tail). Interestingly, Dinu and Baroni (2014) showed that the decomposition function we will adopt here can derive both adjective-noun and noun-PP phrases, suggesting that our approach could be seamlessly extended to visual attributes expressed by noun-modifying PPs.\nar X\niv :1\n50 1.\n02 71\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n2 Ja\nn 20\nmantic intuition (Silberer et al., 2013). Moreover, automated attribute annotation can facilitate finergrained image retrieval (e.g., a user searching for a rocky beach rather than a sandy beach) and provide the basis for more accurate image search (for example in cases of visual sense disambiguation (Divvala et al., 2014), where a user disambiguates their query by searching for images of wooden cabinet as furniture and not just cabinet, which can also mean council).\nClassic attribute-centric image analysis requires, however, extensive manual and often domainspecific annotation of attributes (Vedaldi et al., 2014), or, at best, complex unsupervised imageand-text-mining procedures to learn them (Berg et al., 2010). At the same time, resources with highquality per-image attribute annotations are limited; to the best of our knowledge, coverage of all publicly available datasets containing non-class specific attributes does not exceed 100 attributes,2 orders of magnitude smaller than the equivalent objectannotated datasets (Deng et al., 2009). Moreover, many visual attributes currently available (e.g., 2Dboxy, furniture leg), albeit visually meaningful, do not have straightforward linguistic equivalents, rendering them inappropriate for applications requiring natural linguistic expressions, such as the search scenarios considered above.\nA promising way to limit manual attribute annotation effort is to extend recently proposed zero-shot learning methods, until now applied to object recognition, to the task of labeling images with attributedenoting adjectives. The zero-shot approach relies on the possibility to extract, through distributional methods, semantically effective vector-based word representations from text corpora, on a large scale and without supervision (Turney and Pantel, 2010). In zero-shot learning, training images labeled with object names are also represented as vectors (of features extracted with standard image-analysis techniques), that are paired with the vectors representing the corresponding object names in language-\n2The attribute datasets we are aware of are the ones of Farhadi et al. (2010), Ferrari and Zisserman (2007) and Russakovsky and Fei-Fei (2010), containing annotations for 64, 7 and 25 attributes, respectively (this count excludes the SUN Attributes Database (Patterson et al., 2014), whose attributes characterize scenes rather than concrete objects).\nbased distributional semantic space. Given such paired training data, various algorithms (Socher et al., 2013; Frome et al., 2013; Lazaridou et al., 2014) can be used to induce a cross-modal projection of images onto linguistic space. This projection is then applied to map previously unseen objects to the corresponding linguistic labels. The method takes advantage of the similarities in the vector space topologies of the two modalities, allowing information propagation from the limited number of objects seen in training to virtually any object with a vector-based linguistic representation.\nTo adapt zero-shot learning to attributes, we rely on their nature as (salient) properties of objects, and on how this is reflected linguistically in modifier relations between adjectives and nouns. We build on the observation that the visual and linguistic attribute-adjective vector spaces exhibit similar structures: Specifically, the correlation between the pairwise similarities in visual and linguistic space of all attributes-adjectives from our experiments is 0.14 (significant at p < 10\u221230). While the correlation is smaller than for object-noun data (0.23), we conjecture that it is sufficient for zero-shot learning of attributes. We will confirm this conjecture by testing a cross-modal projection function from attributes, such as colors and shapes, onto adjectives in linguistic semantic space, trained on pre-existing annotated datasets covering less than 100 attributes (Experiment 1).\nWe proceed to develop an approach achieving equally good attribute-labeling performance without manual attribute annotation. Inspired by linguistic and cognitive theories (Murphy, 2002) that characterize objects as attribute bundles, we hypothesize that, when we learn to project images of objects to the corresponding noun labels, we implicitly learn to\nassociate the visual properties/attributes of the objects to the corresponding adjectives. As an example, Figure 1 (right) displays the nearest attributes of car, bird and puppy in the visual space and, interestingly, the relative distance between the noun denoting objects and the adjective denoting attributes is also preserved in the linguistic space (left).\nWe further observe that, as also highlighted by recent work in object recognition, any object in an image is, in a sense, a visual phrase (Sadeghi and Farhadi, 2011; Divvala et al., 2014), i.e., the object and its attributes are mutually dependent. For example, we cannot visually isolate the object drum from attributes such as wooden and round. Indeed, within our data, in 80% of the cases the projected image of an object is closer to the semantic representation of a phrase describing it than to either the object or attribute labels. See Figure 2 for an example.\nMotivated by this observation, we turn to recent work in distributional semantics defining a vector decomposition framework (Dinu and Baroni, 2014) which, given a vector encoding the meaning of a phrase, aims at decoupling its constituents, producing vectors that can then be matched to a sequence of words best capturing the semantics of the phrase. We adopt this framework to decompose image representations projected onto linguistic space into an\nadjective-noun phrase. We show that the method yields results comparable to those obtained when using attribute-labeled training data, while only requiring object-annotated data. Interestingly, this decompositional approach also doubles the performance of object/noun annotation over the standard zeroshot approach (Experiment 2). Given the positive results of our proposed method, we conclude with an extrinsic evaluation (Experiment 3); we show that attribute-centric representations of images created with the decompositional approach boost performance in an object classification task, supporting claims about its practical utility."}, {"heading": "2 General experimental setup", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Cross-Modal Mapping", "text": "Our approach relies on cross-modal mapping from a visual semantic space V, populated with vectorbased representations of images, onto a linguistic (distributional semantic) space W of word vectors. The mapping is performed by first inducing a function fproj : Rd1 \u2192 Rd2 from data points (vi, wi), where vi \u2208 Rd1 is a vector representation of an image tagged with an object or an attribute (such as dog or metallic), and wi \u2208 Rd2 is the linguistic vector representation of the corresponding word. The mapping function can subsequently be applied to any given image vi \u2208 V to obtain its projection w\u2032i \u2208W onto linguistic space:\nw\u2032i = fproj(vi)\nSpecifically, we consider two mapping methods. In the RIDGE regression approach, we learn a linear function Fproj \u2208 Rd2\u00d7d1 by solving the TikhonovPhillips regularization problem, which minimizes the following objective:\n||W Tr \u2212 FprojV Tr||22 \u2212 ||\u03bbFproj ||22,\nwhere W Tr and V Tr are obtained by stacking the word vectors wi and corresponding image vectors vi, from the training set.3\nSecond, motivated by the success of Canonical Correlations Analysis (CCA) (Hotelling, 1936) in several vision-and-language tasks, such as image\n3The parameter \u03bb is determined through cross-validation on the training data.\nand caption retrieval (Gong et al., 2014; Hardoon et al., 2004; Hodosh et al., 2013), we adapt normalized Canonical Correlations Analysis (NCCA) to our setup. Given two paired observation matrices X and Y , in our case W Tr and V Tr, CCA seeks two projection matrices A and B that maximize the correlation between ATX and BTY . This can be solved efficiently by applying SVD to\nC\u0302 1/2 XXC\u0302XY C\u0302 1/2 Y Y = U\u03a3V T ,\nwhere C\u0302 stands for the covariance matrix. Finally, the projection matrices are defined as A = C\u03021/2XXU and B = C\u03021/2Y Y V . Gong et al. (2014) propose a normalized variant of CCA, in which the projection matrices are further scaled by some power \u03bb of the singular values \u03a3 returned by the SVD solution. In our experiments, we tune the choice of \u03bb on the training data. Trivially, if \u03bb = 0, NCCA reduces to CCA.\nNote that other mapping functions could also be used. We leave a more extensive exploration of possible alternatives to further research, since the details of how the vision-to-text conversion is conducted are not crucial for the current study. As increasingly more effective mapping methods are developed, we can easily plug them into our architecture.\nThrough the selected cross-modal mapping function, any image can be projected in linguistic space, where the word (possibly of the appropriate part of speech) corresponding to the nearest vector is returned as a candidate label for the image (following standard practice in distributional semantics, we measure proximity by the cosine measure)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Representational Spaces", "text": "Linguistic Space We construct distributional vectors from text through the method recently proposed by Mikolov et al.

In our case, we use PHOW-color features, a variant of dense SIFT (Bosch et al., 2007), as lowlevel descriptors, and a visual vocabulary of 600 words. Spatial information is preserved with a twolevel spatial pyramid representation (Lazebnik et al., 2006), achieving a final dimensionality of 12,000. The entire pipeline is implemented using the VLFeat library (Vedaldi and Fulkerson, 2010), and its setup is identical to the basic recognition sample application there.7 We apply Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (Evert, 2005) to the BoVW counts, and reduce the resulting vectors to 300 dimensions using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)."}, {"heading": "2.3 Evaluation Dataset", "text": "For evaluation purposes, we use the dataset consisting of images annotated with adjective-noun phrases introduced in Russakovsky and Fei-Fei (2010), which pertains to 384 WordNet/ImageNet synsets with 25 images per synset. The images were manually annotated with 25 attribute-denoting adjectives related to texture, color, pattern and shape, respecting the constraints that a color must cover a significant part of the target object, and all other attributes must pertain to the object as a whole (as opposed to parts). Table 1 lists the 25 attributes and Table 2 illustrates sample annotations.8\nIn order to increase annotation quality, we only consider attributes with full annotator consensus, for a total of 8,449 annotated images, with 2.7 attributes per-image on average.

In the first experiment, we test whether this correspondence in attribute-adjective similarity structure across modalities suffices to successfully apply zero-shot labeling. We learn a crossmodal function from an annotated dataset and use it to label images from an evaluation dataset with attributes outside the training set. We will refer to this approach as DIRA, for Direct Retrieval using Attribute annotation. Note that this is the first time that zero-shot techniques are used in the attribute\ndomain. In the present evaluation, we distinguish DIRA-RIDGE and DIRA-NCCA, according to the cross-modal function used to project from images to linguistic representations (see Section 2.1 above)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Cross-modal function training and evaluation", "text": "To gather sufficient data to train a cross-modal mapping function for attributes/adjectives, we combine the publicly available datasets of Farhadi et al. (2009) and Ferrari and Zisserman (2007) with attributes and associated images extracted from MIRFLICKR (Huiskes and Lew, 2008).9 The resulting dataset contains 72 distinct attributes and 2,300 images. Each image-attribute pair represents a training data point (v, wadj), where v is the vector representation of the image, and wadj is the linguistic-space vector of the attribute (corresponding to an adjective). No information about the depicted object is needed.\nTo further maximize the amount of training data points, we conduct a leave-one-attribute-out evaluation, in which the cross-modal mapping function is repeatedly learned on all 72 attributes from the training set, as well as all but one attribute from the evaluation set (Section 2.3), and the associated images. This results in 72+(25\u22121) = 96 training attributes in total. On average, 45 images per attribute are used. The performance is measured for the single attribute that was excluded from training.

This fully supervised approach can be seen as an ambitious upper bound for zero-shot learning, and we directly compare our performance to theirs using their figure of merit, namely area under the ROC curve (AUC), which is commonly used for binary classification problems.10 A perfect classifier achieves an AUC of 1, whereas an AUC of 0.5 indicates random guess-\n9We filtered out attributes not expressed by adjectives, such as wheel or leg.\n10Table 4 reports hit@k results for DIRA, which will be discussed below in the context of Experiment 2.\ning. For purposes of AUC computation, DIRA is said to label test images with a given adjective if the linguistic-space distance between their mapped representation and the adjective is below a certain threshold. AUC measures the aggregated performance over all thresholds. To get a sense of what AUC compares to in terms of precision and recall, the AUC of DIRA for furry is 0.74, while the precision is 71% and the corresponding recall 14%. For the more difficult blue case, AUC is at 0.5, precision and recall are 2% and 55%, respectively.\nThe AUC results are presented in Figure 3 (ignore red bars for now). We observe first that, of the two mapping functions we considered, RIDGE (blue bars) clearly outperforms NCCA (yellow bars), having higher AUC in 18/25 cases. This is somewhat surprising given the better performance of NCCA in the experiments of Gong et al. (2014). However, our setup is quite different from theirs: They perform all retrieval tasks by projecting the input visual and language data onto a common multimodal space different from both input spaces. NCCA is a wellsuited algorithm for this. We aim instead at producing linguistic annotations of images, which is most straightforwardly accomplished by projecting visual representations onto linguistic space. Regressionbased learning (in our case, via RIDGE) is a more natural choice for this purpose.\nComing now to a more general analysis of the results, as expected, and analogously to the supervised setting, DIRA-RIDGE performance varies across attributes. Some achieve performance close to the supervised model (e.g., rectangular or wooden) and,\nfor 18 out of 25, the performance is well above chance (p < 0.05, bootstrap test). The exceptions are: blue, square, round, vegetation, smooth, spotted and striped. Interestingly, for the last 4 attributes in this list, Russakovsky and Fei-Fei (2010) achieved their lowest performance, and commented that it was due to lower-quality of the corresponding image annotation. Furthermore, Russakovsky and Fei-Fei (2010) excluded 5 attributes due to insufficient training data. Of these, our performance for blue, vegetation and square is not particularly encouraging, but for violet and pink we achieve more than 0.7 AUC, at the level of the supervised classifiers, suggesting that the proposed method can complement the latter when annotated data are not available.\nFor a different perspective on the performance of DIRA, we took several objects and queried the model for their most common attribute, based on the average attribute rank across all images of the object in the dataset. Reassuringly, we learn that sunflowers are on average yellow (mean rank 2.3), fields are green (4.4), cabinets are wooden (4) and vans metallic (6.6) (strawberries are, suspiciously, blue, 2.7).\nOverall, this experiment shows that, just like object classification, attribute classifiers benefit from knowledge transfer between the visual and linguistic modalities, and zero-shot learning can achieve reasonable performance on attributes and the corresponding adjectives. This conclusion is nevertheless based on the assumption that per-image annotations of attributes are available; in the following section, we show how equal and even better performance can be attained using data sets annotated with objects\nonly, and therefore without any hand-coded attribute information."}, {"heading": "4 Experiment 2: Learning attributes from objects and visual phrases", "text": "Having shown that reasonably accurate annotations of unseen attributes can be obtained with zero-shot learning when a small amount of manual annotation is available, we now proceed to test the intuition, preliminarily supported by the data in Figure 1, that, since objects are bundles of attributes, attributes are implicitly learned together with objects. We thus try to induce attribute-denoting adjective labels by exploiting only widely-available object-noun data. At the same time, building on the observation illustrated in Figure 2 that pictures of objects are pictures of visual phrases, we experiment with a vector decomposition model which treats images as composite and derives adjective and noun annotations jointly. We compare it with standard zeroshot learning using direct label retrieval as well as against a number of challenging alternatives that exploit gold-standard information about the depicted objects.

(2009), as well as the most frequent nouns in our corpus for which ImageNet data exist, for a total of 750 objects-nouns. For each object label, we include at most 50 images from the corresponding ImageNet synset, resulting in \u224823, 000 training data points.

The only difference with DIRA (more precisely, DIRA-RIDGE), the zero-shot approach we tested above, is that the mapping function has been trained on object-noun data only.\nDEC Dinu and Baroni (2014) have recently proposed a general Decomposition framework that, given a distributional vector encoding a phrase meaning and the syntactic structure of that phrase, decomposes it into a set of vectors expected to express the semantics of the words that composed the phrase. In our setup, we are interested in a decomposition function fDec : Rd2 \u2192 R2d2 which, given a visual vector projected onto the linguistic space, assumes it represents the meaning of an adjectivenoun phrase, and decomposes it into two vectors corresponding to the adjective and noun constituents [wadj ;wnoun] = fDec(wAN ). We take fDec to be a linear function and, following Dinu and Baroni (2014), we use as training data vectors of adjectivenoun bigrams directly extracted from the corpus together with the concatenation of the corresponding adjective and noun word vectors. We estimate fDec by solving a Ridge regression problem minimizing the following objective:\n||[W Tradj ;W Trnoun]\u2212 FdecW TrAN ||22 \u2212 ||\u03bbFdec||22\nwhereW Tradj ,W Tr noun,W Tr AN are the matrices obtained by stacking the training data vectors. The \u03bb parameter is tuned through generalized cross-validation (Hastie et al., 2009).\nWe train fDec with about \u2248 50, 000 training instances, selected based on corpus frequency. These data are further balanced by not allowing more than 100 training samples for any adjective or noun in order to prevent very frequent words such as other or new from dominating the training data. No image data are used, and there is no need for manual annotation, as the AN-adjective-noun tuples are automatically extracted from the corpus.\nAt test time, given an image to be labeled, we project its visual representation onto the linguistic space and decompose the resulting vector w\u2032 into two candidate adjective and noun vectors: [w\u2032adj ;w \u2032 noun] = fDec(w\n\u2032). We then search the linguistic space for adjectives and nouns whose vectors are nearest to w\u2032adj and w \u2032 noun, respectively."}, {"heading": "4.3 Object-informed models", "text": "A cross-modal function trained exclusively on object-noun data might be able to capture only prototypical characteristics of an object, as induced from text, independently of whether they are depicted in an image. Although the gold annotation of our dataset should already penalize this imageindependent labeling strategy (see Section 2.3), we control for this behaviour by comparing against three models that have access to the gold noun annotations of the image and favor adjectives that are typical modifiers of the nouns.\nLM We build a bigram Language Model by using the Berkeley LM toolkit (Pauls and Klein, 2012)11 on the one-trillion-token Google Web1T corpus12 and smooth probabilities with the \u201cStupid\u201d backoff technique (Brants et al., 2007). Given an image with object-noun annotation, we score all attributes-adjectives based on the language-modelderived conditional probability p(adjective|noun). All images of the same object produce identical rankings. As an example, among the top attributes of cocktail we find heady, creamy and fruity.\nVLM LM does not exploit visual information about the image to be annotated. A natural way to enhance it is to combine it with DIRO, our crossmodal mapping adjective retrieval method. In the visually-enriched Language Model, we interpolate the ranks produced by the two models, assigning them equal weights without tuning. In the resulting combination, attributes that are both linguistically sensible and likely to be present in the given image should be ranked highest. We expect this approach to be challenging to beat.

Although worse than DIRA, the relatively high performance of DIRO is a promising result, suggesting object annotations together with linguistic knowledge extracted in an unsupervised manner from large corpora can replace, to some extent, manual attribute annotations. However, DIRO does not directly model any semantic compatibility constraints between the retrieved adjectives and the object present in the image (see examples below). Hence, the object-informed model VLM, which combines visual information wit linguistic co-occurrence statistics, doubles the performance of DIRO, LM and SP.\nOur DEC model, that treats images as visual phrases and jointly decouples their semantics, outperforms even VLM by a large margin. DEC outperforms DIRA, the standard zero-shot learning approach using attribute-adjective annotated data (see also the attribute-by-attribute AUC comparison between DEC, DIRA and the fully-supervised approach of Russakovsky and Fei-Fei in Figure 3).\nInterestingly, accounting for the phrasal nature of visual information leads to substantial performance improvement in object recognition through zeroshot learning (i.e., tagging images with the depicted nouns) as well. Table 6 provides the hit@k results obtained with the DIRO and DEC methods for the noun retrieval task in a search space of 10,000 most frequent nouns from our corpus. Note that DIRO represents the label retrieval technique that has been standardly used in conjunction with zero-shot learning for objects: The cross-modal function is trained on images annotated with nouns that denote the objects they depict, and it is then used for noun label\nretrieval of unseen objects through a nearest neighbor search of the mapped image representation (the DIRA column shows that zero-shot noun retrieval using the mapping function trained on adjectives works very poorly). DEC decomposes instead the mapped image representation into two vectors denoting adjective and noun semantics, respectively, and uses the latter to perform the nearest neighbor search for a noun label. Although not directly comparable, the results of DEC reported here are in the same range of state-of-the-art zero-shot learning models for object recognition (Frome et al., 2013).\nAnnotation examples Table 7 presents some interesting patterns we observed in the results. The first example illustrates the case in which conducting adjective and noun retrieval independently results in mixing information, which damages the DIRO approach: Adjectival and nominal properties are not decoupled properly, since the animal property of the depicted dog is reflected in both the animal adjective and the goat noun. At the same time, the whiteness of the object (an adjectival property) influences noun selection, since goats tend to be white. Instead, DEC unpacks the visual semantics in an accurate and meaningful way, producing correct attribute and noun annotations which also form acceptable phrases. LM and VLM are negatively affected by\nco-occurrence statistics and guess stray and pet as adjectives, both typical but generic and abstract dog properties.\nIn the next example, DIRO annotates the image with a reasonable noun label (ramekin), focusing on the container rather than the liquid it contains. However, by ignoring the relation between the adjective and the noun, the resulting adjective annotation (crunchy) is semantically incompatible with liquids as well as containers, emphasizing the inability of this method to account for semantic relations between attributes-adjectives and object-nouns. DEC, on the other hand, mistakenly annotates the object as flan instead of syrup. However, having captured the right general category of the object (\u201csmooth gelatinous items that reflect light\u201d), it ranks a semantically appropriate and correct attribute (shiny) at the top. Again, the adjective proposed by LM and VLM (chocolate) is semantically appropriate for syrup but irrelevant for the target image.\nSemantic plausibility of phrases The examples above suggest that one fundamental way in which DEC improves over DIRO is by producing semantically coherent adjective-noun combinations. More systematic evidence for this conjecture is provided by a follow-up experiment on the linguistic quality of the generated phrases. We randomly sampled 2 images for each of the 203 objects in our data set. For each image, we let the two models generate 9 descriptive phrases by combining their respective top 3 adjective and noun predictions. Many items were repeated in the two resulting lists of 3,654 phrases, and we picked the 200 most common ones for each model (only 1/8 of these common phrases were shared by the models). The selected phrases were presented (in random order and concealing their origin) to two linguistically-sophisticated annotators, who were asked to rate them for degree of semantic plausibility on a 1-3 scale (the annotators were not shown the corresponding images, so they had to evaluate phrases purely on linguistic/semantic grounds). The two judges were largely in agreement (\u03c1 = 0.63). We thus averaged their ratings. The mean averaged plausibility score for DIRO phrases was 1.74 (s.d.: 0.76), for DEC it was 2.48 (s.d.: 0.64), with the difference highly significant according to a Mann-Whitney test (p < 0.01). The two an-\nnotators agreed in assigning the lowest score (\u201ccompletely implausible\u201d) to more than one third of the DIRO phrases (74/200; e.g., tinned tostada, animal bird, hollow hyrax), but they unanimously assigned the lowest score to only 7/200 DEC phrases (e.g., cylindrical bed-sheet, sweet ramekin, wooden meat). We thus have solid quantitative support for the claim that the superiority of DEC is at least partially due to how it learns to jointly account for adjective and noun semantics, producing phrases that are linguistically more meaningful.\nAdjective concreteness We can gain further insight into the nature of the adjectives chosen by the models by considering the fact that phrases that are meant to describe an object in a picture should mostly contain concrete adjectives, and thus the degree of concreteness of the adjectives produced by a model is an indirect measure of its quality. Following Hill and Korhonen (2014), we define the concreteness of an adjective as the average concreteness score of the nouns it modifies in our text corpus. Noun concreteness scores are taken, in turn, from Turney et al. (2011). For each test image and model, we obtain a concreteness score by averaging the concreteness of the top 5 adjectives that the model selected for the image. Table 4 reports the distributions of the resulting scores across models. We confirm that the purely language-based models (LM, SP) are producing generic abstract adjectives that\nare not appropriate to describe images (e.g., cryptographic key, homemade bread, Greek salad, beaten yolk). The image-informed VLM and DIRO models produce considerably more concrete adjectives. Not surprisingly, DIRA, that was directly trained on concrete adjectives, produces the most concrete adjectives. Importantly, DEC, despite being based on a cross-modal function that was not explicitly exposed to adjectives, produced adjectives that are approaching the concreteness level of those of DIRA (according to paired Mann-Whitney tests, the difference between DEC and DIRO as well as DEC and DIRA is significant at p < 0.01)."}, {"heading": "5 Using DEC for attribute-based object classification", "text": "As discussed in the introduction, attributes can effectively be used for attribute-based object classification. In this section, we show that classifiers trained on attribute representations created with DEC \u2013 which does not require any attributeannotated training data nor training a battery of attribute classifiers \u2013 outperform (and are complementary to) standard supervised object classifiers based on BoVW features.\nWe use a subset of the Pascal VOC 2008 dataset.14 Specifically, following Farhadi et al. (2009), we use the original VOC training set for training/validation, and the VOC validation set for testing. One-vs-all linear-SVM classifiers are trained for all VOC objects, using 3 alternative image representations.\nFirst, we train directly on BoVW features (PHOW, see Section 2.2), as in the classic object recognition pipeline. We compare PHOW to an attribute-centric approach with attribute labels automatically generated by DEC. All VOC images are projected onto the linguistic space using the crossmodal mapping function trained with object-noun data only (see Section 4.1), from which we further removed all images depicting a VOC object. Each image projection is then decomposed through DEC into two vectors representing adjective and noun information. The final attribute-centric vector representing an image is created by recording the cosine similarities of the DEC-generated adjective vector\n14http://pascallin.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ challenges/VOC/voc2008/\nwith all the adjectives in our linguistic space. Informally, this representation can be thought of as a vector of weights describing the appropriateness of each adjective as an annotation for the image.15 This is comparable to standard attribute-based classification (Farhadi et al., 2009), in which images are represented as distributions over attributes estimated with a set of ad hoc supervised attribute-specific classifiers. Table 8 show examples of top attributes automatically assigned by DEC. While not nearly as accurate as manual annotation, many attributes are relevant to the objects, both as specifically depicted in the image (the aeroplane is wet), but also more prototypically (aeroplanes are cylindrical in general).\nWe also perform feature-level fusion (FUSED) by concatenating the PHOW and DEC features, and reducing the resulting vector to 100 dimensions with SVD (Bruni et al., 2014) (SVD dimensionality determined by cross-validation on the training set)."}, {"heading": "5.1 Results", "text": "There is an improvement over PHOW visual features when using DEC-based attribute vectors, with accuracy raising from 30.49% to 32.76%. The confusion matrices in Figure 5 show that PHOW and DEC do not only differ in quantitative performance, but make different kinds of errors, in part pointing at the different modalities the two models tap into. PHOW, for example, tends to confuse cats with sofas, probably because the former are often pictured lying on\n15Given that the resulting representations are very dense, we sparsify them by setting to zeros all adjective dimensions with cosine below the global mean cosine value.\nthe latter. DEC, on the other hand, tends to confuse chairs with TV monitors, partially misguided by the taxonomic information encoded in language (both are pieces of furniture). Indeed, the combined FUSED approach outperforms both representations by a large margin (35.81%), confirming that the linguistically-enriched information brought by DEC is to a certain extent complementary to the lowerlevel visual evidence directly exploited by PHOW.\nThe performance of our system is quite close to the one obtained by Farhadi et al. (2009) with ensembles of supervised attribute classifiers trained on manually annotated data (the most comparable accuracy from their Table 1 is at 34.3%).16\n16Fahradi and colleagues reduce the bias for the people category by reporting mean per-class accuracy; we directly excluded people from our version of the data set."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We extended zero-shot image labeling beyond objects, showing that it is possible to tag images with attribute-denoting adjectives that were not seen during training. For some attributes, performance was comparable to that of per-attribute supervised classifiers. We further showed that attributes are implicitly induced when learning to map visual vectors of objects to their linguistic realizations as nouns, and that improvements in both attribute and noun retrieval is attained by treating images as visual phrases, whose linguistic representations must be decomposed into a coherent word sequence. The resulting model outperformed a set of strong rivals. While the performance of the zero-shot decompositional approach to adjective-noun phrase labeling alone might still be too low for practical applications, we showed that this model can already produce attribute-based representations that significantly improve performance in a supervised object recognition task, when combined with standard visual features.\nBy mapping attributes and objects to phrases in a linguistic space, we are also likely to produce more natural descriptions than those currently used in computer vision (fluffy kittens rather than 2-boxy tables). In future work, we want to delve more into the linguistic and pragmatic naturalness of attributes: Can we predict not just which attributes are true of a depicted object, but which are more salient and thus more likely to be mentioned (red car over metal car)? Can we pick the most appropriate adjective to denote an attribute given the object in the picture (moist, rather than damp lips)? We also need to take multiple attributes and their dependencies into account: by ignoring them, we currently get undesired results, such as the aeroplane in Table 8 being tagged as both wet and dry.\nMore ambitiously, inspired by Karpathy et al. (2014), we would like to associate image fragments with phrases of arbitrary syntactic structures (e.g., a PP describing the background, a VP for the main event, etc.), thus paving the way to full-fledged caption generation."}], "references": [{"title": "Automatic attribute discovery and characterization from noisy Web data", "author": ["Tamara Berg", "Alexander Berg", "Jonathan Shih."], "venue": "ECCV, pages 663\u2013676, Crete, Greece.", "citeRegEx": "Berg et al\\.,? 2010", "shortCiteRegEx": "Berg et al\\.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Image classification using random forests and ferns", "author": ["Anna Bosch", "Andrew Zisserman", "Xavier Munoz."], "venue": "Proceedings of ICCV, pages 1\u20138.", "citeRegEx": "Bosch et al\\.,? 2007", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bosch et al\\.", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Large language models in machine translation", "author": ["Thorsten Brants", "Ashok C Popat", "Peng Xu", "Franz J Och", "Jeffrey Dean."], "venue": "In Proceedings of EMNLP/CONLL, pages 858\u2013867.", "citeRegEx": "Brants et al\\.,? 2007", "shortCiteRegEx": "Brants et al\\.", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Multimodal distributional semantics", "author": ["Elia Bruni", "Nam Khanh Tran", "Marco Baroni."], "venue": "Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 49:1\u201347.", "citeRegEx": "Bruni et al\\.,? 2014", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bruni et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database", "author": ["Jia Deng", "Wei Dong", "Richard Socher", "Lia-Ji Li", "Li Fei-Fei."], "venue": "Proceedings of CVPR, pages 248\u2013255, Miami Beach, FL.", "citeRegEx": "Deng et al\\.,? 2009", "shortCiteRegEx": "Deng et al\\.", "year": 2009}, {"title": "How to make words with vectors: Phrase generation in distributional semantics", "author": ["Georgiana Dinu", "Marco Baroni."], "venue": "Proceedings of ACL, pages 624\u2013633, Baltimore, MD.", "citeRegEx": "Dinu and Baroni.,? 2014", "shortCiteRegEx": "Dinu and Baroni.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Learning everything about anything: Weblysupervised visual concept learning", "author": ["Santosh Divvala", "Ali Farhadi", "Carlos Guestrin."], "venue": "Proceedings of CVPR.", "citeRegEx": "Divvala et al\\.,? 2014", "shortCiteRegEx": "Divvala et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "A flexible, corpus-driven model of regular and inverse selectional preferences", "author": ["Katrin Erk", "Sebastian Pad\u00f3", "Ulrike Pad\u00f3."], "venue": "Computational Linguistics, 36(4):723\u2013763.", "citeRegEx": "Erk et al\\.,? 2010", "shortCiteRegEx": "Erk et al\\.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "The Statistics of Word Cooccurrences", "author": ["Stefan Evert."], "venue": "Ph.D dissertation, Stuttgart University.", "citeRegEx": "Evert.,? 2005", "shortCiteRegEx": "Evert.", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Describing objects by their attributes", "author": ["Ali Farhadi", "Ian Endres", "Derek Hoiem", "David Forsyth."], "venue": "Proceedings of CVPR, pages 1778\u20131785, Miami Beach, FL.", "citeRegEx": "Farhadi et al\\.,? 2009", "shortCiteRegEx": "Farhadi et al\\.", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Every picture tells a story: Generating sentences from images", "author": ["Ali Farhadi", "Mohsen Hejrati", "Mohammad A.

By building on the recent \u201czeroshot learning\u201d approach, and paying attention to the linguistic nature of attributes as noun modifiers, and specifically adjectives, we show that it is possible to tag images with attribute-denoting adjectives even when no training data containing the relevant annotation are available. Our approach relies on two key observations. First, objects can be seen as bundles of attributes, typically expressed as adjectival modifiers (a dog is something furry, brown, etc.), and thus a function trained to map visual representations of objects to nominal labels can implicitly learn to map attributes to adjectives. Second, objects and attributes come together in pictures (the same thing is a dog and it is brown). We can thus achieve better attribute (and object) label retrieval by treating images as \u201cvisual phrases\u201d, and decomposing their linguistic representation into an attribute-denoting adjective and an object-denoting noun. Our approach performs comparably to a method exploiting manual attribute annotation, it outperforms various competitive alternatives in both attribute and object annotation, and it automatically constructs attribute-centric representations that significantly improve performance in supervised object recognition.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
