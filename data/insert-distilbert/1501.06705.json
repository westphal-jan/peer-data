Within this paper we will propose and present two forms of inclusion: The strict and the partial one. In order to develop this relation, we will study the case of consonant belief function. To do so, we will simulate normal distributions allowing us to model and analyze these relations. Based on that, we will determine the parameters influencing and characterizing the two forms of inclusion.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe theory of belief functions (also called Evidential Theory or The Dempster-Shafer Theory) is a well known framework for reasoning under uncertainty [1]. It is widely used to model imperfect information. We can distinguish the imprecision (lack of accuracy), the uncertainty (lack of compliance comparing to the real world, due to the source of information) and even the inconstancy where is characterized by a high level of conflict.\nThe discrete case of belief functions, knowning a large succes, have been applied to several research fields, medical, military, risk management, information fusion [2], [3], [4], etc.\nOtherwise, Smets in [5], defined the basic notions of continuous belief functions to describe them in the extended set of reals. Recently Attiaoui et al. [6] proposed a similarity measure for continuous belief functions based on Smets\u2019 formalism using the distance of Jousselme [7].\nOur work in this paper will consider the notion of inclusion and how two continuous belief functions can be included in each other. This operation will help us later to take into account this specific characteristic during the information fusion and the measurement of the conflit. Thus, we will define two forms: the strict inclusion and the partial one. To do so, we will present a measure called a degree of inclusion of an interval (the focal element of a continuous belief function) in the second one. This work presents a new way to determine\nthe relation of inclusion by considering a new vision for the continuous case within the theory of belief functions."}, {"heading": "II. THEORY OF BELIEF FUNCTIONS: AN OVERVIEW", "text": "This section recalls the necessary background related to the evidential theory. It has been developed by Dempster in his work on upper and lower probabilities [1]. Based on that, he was able to represent more precisely the observed data. Later, in his book \u201dA mathematical Theory of evidence\u201d [8], Shafer, presented that, any information defined by an expert characterized by basic belief assignments has two functions: a credibility and a plausibility function corresponding respectively to the lower and upper probabilities of Dempster. The theory was further developed by Smets in [9], [10] who proposed the Transferable Belief Model (TBM). This model presents a pignistic probability induced by a belief function which is built by defining a uniform probability from each positive mass. Moreover, in terms of upper and lower probabilities, it can be considered as the center of gravity of the set of probabilities dominating the belief functions. He also introduced new tools for information fusion and decision making according to [11]. The objective of the evidential theory is to represent the information which is transmitted by a source concerning an event. A belief function must take in consideration all the possible events on which a source can describe a belief. Based on that, we can define the frame of discernment.\nThe frame of discernment is a finite set of disjoint elements noted \u2126 where \u2126 = {\u03c91, ..., \u03c9n}. This theory allows us to affect a mass on a set of hypotheses not only a singleton like in the probabilistic theory. Thus, we are able to represent ignorance, imprecision and uncertainty.\nm : 2\u2126 7\u2192 [0, 1]. (1)\nar X\niv :1\n50 1.\n06 70\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 7\nJa n\n20 15\n\u2211 X\u2286\u2126 m(X) = 1. (2)\nThe principle functions in the belief functions theory are: The credibility function (bel): this function measures the strength of the evidence in favor of a set of propositions for all X \u2208 2\u2126:\nbel(X) = \u2211\nY\u2286X,Y 6=\u2205\nm(Y ).

(5)\nA. Inclusion as a conflict measure for discrete belief functions\nRecently Martin in [12] defined a degree of inclusion as involved in the measurement made in order to determine the conflict during the combination of two discrete belief functions. The author presented an index of inclusion having binary values where Inc(X1, Y2) = 1 if X1 \u2286 Y2 and 0 otherwise with X1, Y2 being respectively the focal elements of m1 and m2. This index is then used to measure the degree of inclusion of the two mass functions and defined as:\ndinc = 1 |F1||F2| \u2211\nX1\u2208F1 \u2211 Y2\u2208F1 Inc(X1, Y2) (6)\n\u03c3inc(m1,m2) = max(dinc(m1,m2), dinc(m2,m1)) (7)\nWhere dinc is the degree of inclusion of m1 in m2 and inversely. This inclusion is used as a conflict measure for two mass functions, using it like presented:\nConf(m1,m2) = 1\u2212 \u03c3inc(m1,m2)d(m1,m2) (8)\nwhere d(m1,m2), is the distance of Jousselme:\nd(m1,m2) =\n\u221a 1\n2 (m1 \u2212m2)TD(m1 \u2212m2); (9)\nwhere D is a matrix based on the dissimilarity of Jaccard expressed by D(A,B) = 1 if A = B = \u2205 otherwise, D(A,B) = |A\u2229B||A\u222aB| if \u2200A,B \u2208 2 \u2126"}, {"heading": "III. CONTINUOUS BELIEF FUNCTIONS", "text": "In the previous sections, we have presented different specifications of discrete belief functions. Unfortunately, these functions do not allow us to manipulate continuous data that can be provided by sensors in different areas like: search and rescue problems [13], classification issues, information fusion, etc. Some researches were interested in representing belief functions in continuous frame of discernment like Strat in [14], and Smets in [5]. In following sections, we will present the several proposals that allows us to describe continuous belief functions. First, we explain how to extend these functions on the real numbers. To do so, we will focus on Smets\u2019 approach to represent continuous belief functions by using probability densities. Later, we will remember the other approaches for the continuous case of the theory of belief functions."}, {"heading": "A. Continuous belief functions on IR", "text": "Smets based on the TBM\u2019s background, used the same representation than Strat, and proposed the belief functions in the extended set of reals noted IR = IR \u222a {\u2212\u221e,+\u221e}. However, using the belief function framework to model information in a continuous frame is not an easy task mainly to the complex nature of the focal elements. Comparing to the discrete domain, on real numbers, in (Smets 2005) bba becomes basic belief densities (bbd) defined on an interval [a, b] of IR.\n1) Basic belief densities: A generalization of the classical bba into a basic belief density (bbd) denoted mI on the interval I. He defined the bbd where all focal elements are closed intervals or \u2205. Given a normalized bbd mI, Smets defined another function f on IR2, where:\n{ f(a, b) = mI([a, b]), a \u2264 b, f(a, b) = 0, a > b.\n(10)\nf is called a probability density function (pdf ) on IR2."}, {"heading": "B. Continuous belief functions induced by probability density functions", "text": "Let\u2019s consider several belief functions characterizing a unique source of information (the source is subjective and evidential). Smets proposed a pignistic transformation of the belief functions (representing the knowledge of the source) in order to obtain probabilities. The probabilities are used to ease the decision making. Pignistic probabilities are noted\nBetP having densities also noted betf . For each probability density, we have a set of belief functions with which they are compatible. This set is called an Isopignitic. The main issue is to choose one belief function from this set. To do so, we consider the principle of least commitment proposed in [15], [16]. This principle supports the idea of choosing the belief function that involves the least an expert. It can be considered as a natural approach to select the less committed bba from a subset. A particular type of belief functions describes the best this principle which are the consonant belief functions where focal elements are nested [17]."}, {"heading": "C. Continuous belief functions: other representations", "text": "Some other approaches have been proposed in order to describe continuous belief functions. [18] introduced in the notions of a source constituted by a probability space and a multivalued mapping which is able to define the lower probability defined by a \u0393 function.\nThis function can hold at the same time two notions: on one hand, it defines both of the lower and upper probability, on the other hand, it considers random sets. We can say that \u0393 as a multivalued mapping is measurable with respect to the spaces that it characterizes.\nMoreover, he supposes that \u0393 is a measurable mapping, then it is a random set by specifying its probability distribution. Thus the probability distribution of a random set \u0393 is precisely the basic probability assignment.\nWe say that there is a correspondence established between belief functions on a source S and the probability distribution of random sets. This relation can be expressed by its density on P (S).\nDore\u0301 et al. in [19], proposed a similar approach founded on an index function that can be assumed as \u0393. This function can describe the set of focal elements of a continuous belief function. In this case, every index has its own probability measure where there is an allocated weight to a set of focal elements using a credal measure. Every set is described according to its index and its probability density.\nThe formalism of Smets takes into consideration only to closed intervals, in [13], the author extended classical continuous belief functions by proposing belief functions where focal elements are not represented by intervals.

ILLUSTRATION OF THE STRICT AND PARTIAL INCLUSIONS\nIn this section we will present our experimental phase to illustrate both of the strict and partial inclusion between two continuous belief functions.\nTo illustrate both of the strict and partial inclusion between two continuous belief functions induced using a normal distribution. We decided to fix the value of the first distribution pdf1, where, it is characterized by its mean \u00b51 = 0 and its standard deviation \u03c31 = 1. For the second distribution pdf2, we will vary the values of \u00b52 in [0, 10] and \u03c32 in [0, 5]. Here, our purpose is to see the behavior of the inclusion when we modify one of the pdfs, and the parameters that infer in the obtained results."}, {"heading": "A. Strict inclusion between belief densities induced by normal distributions", "text": "This strict inclusion is a natural approach, that allows us to perceive if there exists any intersection between two distributions, how they behave and the parameters that interfere during this process. In this case, when a degree of inclusion has binary values of 0 and 1, we will study this property between two continuous belief functions.\nThe more the value of the second standard deviation grows,\nthe more difference between \u03c31 and \u03c32 develops. Here, the strict inclusion between the two distributions, which generates a growth in the behavior of the obtained curve. We are then, in the presence of a growth of the strict inclusion of pdf1 in pdf2 due to the variation of the second distribution. Otherwise, we notice in Figure 2, relative to the strict inclusion, that it is not the gap between the means \u00b51 and \u00b52 that generates this growth. It is the difference between the two standard deviations, that is in the origin of this growing phenomenon of inclusion. As shown when \u03c31 > \u03c32 and \u00b52 having its maximal value with \u00b52 = 5, the strict inclusion is null. This value is due to the fact that the degree of strict inclusion \u03b4IncStr(xi, yi, xj , yj) = 0, which can be explained by the non-existence of any intersection between pdf1 and pdf2. The part of the curve where the difference between the two standard deviations is low and at the same time the difference between the means is high. We have a small growing strict inclusion for example when \u00b52 = 3 and \u03c32 = 1.5, the strict inclusion IncStr(f1, f2) = 0.1. At the meantime, even when \u00b51 = \u00b52 = 0 \u03c31 = \u03c32 = 1, there is an intersection between the two distributions and IncStr(f1, f2) > 0. Moreover, when the gap between \u03c31 and \u03c32 gets higher, the curve increases, generating a bigger strict inclusion between pdf1 and pdf2, until rising its maximal value where IncStr(f1, f2) = 1, with \u03b4IncStr(xi, yi, xj , yj) = 1. In this specific case, we are in presence of a total inclusion of the first distribution pdf1 in the second one pdf2.\nWe also witness a phenomenonin which \u00b52 gets a high value, the strict inclusion drops considerably.

It is possible to state that when we are in presence of two distributions having the same values, there is not necessarily any total inclusion between them. We also take note, that as the difference between \u03c31 and \u03c32 rises, due to the of pdf2, the figure obtained grows faster, and reaches its maximal value IncPar(f1, f2) = 1, generating a curve more arched than the strict inclusion.\nWhen the difference between \u00b51 and \u00b52 increases because of the variation of pdf2, the partial inclusion reaches a value of IncPar(f1, f2) = 0.85, which becomes lower when the gap between two standard deviations is the highest (\u03c32 = 3), we obtain the maximal value for the partial inclusion: IncPar(f1, f2) = 1 like presented in Figure 3. In this specific case, we witness a full and total inclusion of pdf1 in pdf2. This is similar to what we have presented regarding the strict inclusion. Here we have non-negative inclusions, that respect the lower and upper bounds where the values are [0, 1]. Besides, the property of asymmetry is also respected because, the inclusion (what ever is strict or partial) of a distribution in the other does not necessarily involve the inverse case with the same value.\nWhen IncPar = 1, we have a total inclusion of the first distribution pdf1 in the second one pdf2, this situation is considered as a strict inclusion where, pdf1 is fully included in pdf2.\n2) Partial inclusion of pdf2 in pdf1: For this case, we have chosen to measure the partial inclusion of pdf2 in pdf1, saving the same values for both distributions. Otherwise, the equation 18 becomes:\n\u03b4IncPar(xi, yi,xj , yj)= max(0,min(yi, yj)max(xj , xi))\nyj \u2212 xj (22)\nWe obtain the Figure 4. In this case, we notice a different phenomenon comparing to Figure 3. Here, we witness than when the two distributions are totally similar, the value of the partial inclusion equals 0.8183. This value is the maximal one that is expressed in this, and as stated before, two similar distributions can not be fully included in each other. We also observe in this figure, that as long as tha values of the second distribution \u00b52, and \u03c32 rise, the value of the partial inclusion of pdf2 in pdf1 drops. More the two distributions are getting different from each other, more the partial inclusion decreases. Both parameters; the mean and the standard deviation have considerable impacts in this measure. This is proved by the behavior of the partial inclusion.\nThe difference between the Figure 3 and Figure 4 is very obvious considering the behaviors of the two curves. This is due to the nature of the focal elements of continuous belief functions which are expressed by intervals. Specially with the case of the inclusion where each time we measure the inclusion of the intervals of a normal distribution with those of a second normal distribution."}, {"heading": "VII. STRICT INCLUSION VS PARTIAL INCLUSION", "text": "Comparing the results obtained in Figure 2 and Figure 3, where we have the same values for the two distributions, we notice that the partial inclusion reaches the maximal value faster that the strict one.

In Figure 2 and Figure 3, it seems that we have the same phenomena between the two types of inclusion. This can be explained by the fact that we are working with consonant belief functions (where focal intervals are nested). We can imagine that in presence in other nature of belief functions (categorical, or Bayesian belief functions) we can obtain different behaviors between the strict and the partial inclusion.\nWe notice the same phenomena that we have seen for the strict, when the values of parameters characterizing the second distribution grow, generating a big difference between the means, and the standard deviations, the partial inclusion decreases significantly and comparing when we are dealing with smaller values of \u00b52.\nThus, we can say that, both of the mean and the standard deviation do have a real impact on the measurement of the partial inclusion, having the same situation as the strict inclusion.\nIn the case of two distributions getting more and more different and especially when considering only the standard deviation, the phenomena of inclusion gets bigger.

We have defined two forms of inclusions: the strict and the partial one. Before that, we\nhave detailed all preliminary background that will allow us to experiment this kind of relation. We have also provided the approach on which the evaluation of the inclusions will be based.\nWe have presented a relation of inclusion having normalized values that takes into account the nature of continuous belief functions described using intervals as focal elements. These two forms of inclusion respond to all the properties that must be satisfied. We also have shown that both of the mean and the standard deviation have different impacts in this phenomena each one with its specific output."}], "references": [{"title": "Conflict measure for the discounting operation on belief functions", "author": ["A.
