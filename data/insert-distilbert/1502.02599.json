Introduction", "text": "Given a dataset D = {zi = (x>i ,yi)>, i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,n}, where xi = (xi1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,xip)> \u2208X \u2282 IRp and yi \u2208Y are realizations of two random variables X and Y respectively, we seek to use the data D to build estimators f\u0302 of the underlying func-\ntion f for predicting the response Y given the vector X of explanatory variables. In keeping with the standard in statistical learning theory, we will measure the predictive performance of any given function f using the theoretical risk functional given by\nR( f ) = E[`(Y, f (X))] = \u222b\nX \u00d7Y `(x,y)dP(x,y), (1)\nwith the ideal scenario corresponding to the universally best function defined by\nf\u0302 \u2217 = arginf f {R( f )}= arginf f {E[`(Y, f (X))]} . (2)\nFor classification tasks, the most commonly used loss function is the zero-one loss `(Y, f (X)) = 1{Y 6= f (X)}, for which the theoretical universal best defined in (2) is the Bayes classifier given by f \u2217(x) = argmax\ny\u2208Y {Pr[Y = y|x]}. For re-\ngression tasks, the squared loss `(Y, f (X)) = (Y \u2212 f (X))2 is by far the most commonly used, mainly because of the wide variety of statistical, mathematical and computational benefits it offers. For regression under the squared loss, the universal best defined in (2) is also known theoretically known to be the conditional expectation of Y given X , specifically given by f \u2217(x) = E[Y |X = x]. Unfortunately, these theoretically expressions of the best estimators cannot be realized in practice because the distribution function P(x,y) of (X ,Y ) defined on X \u00d7Y is unknown. To circumvent this learning challenge, one has to do essentially two foundational thing, namely: (a) choose a certain function class F (approximation) from which to search for the estimator f\u0302 of the true but unknown underlying f , (b) specify the empirical version of (1) based on the given sample D , an use that empirical risk as the practical objective function. However, in this paper, we do not directly construct our estimating classification functions from the empirical risk. Instead, we build the estimators using other optimality criteria, and then compare their predictive performances using the average test error AVTE(\u00b7), namely\nAVTE( f\u0302 ) = 1 R\nR\n\u2211 r=1 { 1 m m \u2211 t=1 `(y(r)it , f\u0302r(x (r) it )) } , (3)\nar X\niv :1\n50 2.\n02 59\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 9\nF eb\n2 01\nwhere f\u0302r(\u00b7) is the r-th realization of the estimator f\u0302 (\u00b7) built using the training portion of the split of D into training set and test set, and ( x(r)it ,y (r) it ) is the t-th observation from the test set at the r-th random replication of the split of D . In this paper, we consider both multiclass classification tasks with response space Y = {1,2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,G} and regression tasks with Y = IR, and we focus on learning machines from a function class F whose members are ensemble learners in the sense of Definition (1). In machine learning, in order to improve the accuracy of a regression function, or a classification function, scholars tend to combine multiple estimators because it has been proven both theoretically and empirically (Tumer & Ghosh, 1995; Tumer & Oza, 1999) that an appropriate combination of good base learners leads to a reduction in prediction error. This technique is known as ensemble learning (aggregation). In spite of the underlying algorithm used, the ensemble learning technique most of the time (on average) outperforms the single learning technique, especially for prediction purposes (van Wezel & Potharst, 2007). There are many approaches of performing ensemble learning. Among these, there are two popular ensemble learning techniques, bagging (Breiman, 1996) and boosting (Freund, 1995). Many variants of these two techniques have been studied previously such as random forest (Breiman, 2001) and AdaBoost (Freund & Schapire, 1997) and applied in a prediction problem. Our proposed method belongs to the subclass of ensemble learning methods known as random subspace learning.\nDefinition 1 Given an ensemble H = {h1,h2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,hL} of base learners hl : X \u2212\u2192 Y , with relative weight \u03b1l \u2208 IR\u2217+ (usually \u03b1l \u2208 (0,1) for convex aggregation), the ensemble representation f (L) of the underlying function f is given by the aggregation (weighted sum)\nf (L)(\u00b7) = L\n\u2211 l=1 \u03b1lhl(\u00b7). (4)\nA question naturally arises as to how the ensemble H is chosen, and how the weights are determined. Bootstrap Aggregating also known as bagging (Breiman, 1996), boosting (Freund & Schapire, 1996), random forests (Breiman, 2001), and bagging with subspaces (Panov & Dzeroski, 2007) are all predictive learning methods based on the ensemble learning principle for which the ensemble is built from the provided data set D and the weights are typically taken to be equal. In this paper, we focus on learning tasks involving high dimension low sample size (HDLSS) data, and we further zero-in on those data sets for which the number of explanatory variables p is substantially larger than the sample size n. As our main contribution in this paper, we introduce, develop and apply a new adaptation of the theme of random subspace learning (Ho, 1998) using the traditional multiple linear regres-\nsion (MLR) model as our base learner in regression and the generalized linear model (GLM) as a base learner in classification. Some applications by nature posses few instances (small n) with large number of features (p \u226b n) such as fMRI (Kuncheva et al., 2010) and DNA microarrays (Bertoni et al., 2005) data sets. It is hard for a traditional (conventional) algorithm to build a regression model, or to classify the data set when it possesses a very small instances to features ratio. The prediction problem becomes even more difficult when this huge number of features correlated are highly correlated, or irrelevant for the task of building such a model, as we will show later in this paper. Therefore, we harness the power of our proposed adaptive subspace learning technique to guide the choice/selection of good candidate features from the data set, and therefore select the best base learners, and ultimately the ensemble yielding the lowest possible prediction error. In most typical random subspace learning algorithms, the features are selected according to an equally likely scheme. The question then arises as to whether one can devise a better scheme to choose the candidate features for efficiently with some predictive benefits. On the other hand, it is interesting to assess the accuracy of our proposed algorithm under different levels of the correlation of the features. The answer to this question constitutes one of the central aspect of our proposed method, in the sense we explore a variety of weighting scheme for choosing the features, most of them (the schemes) based on statistical measures of relationship between the response variable and each explanatory variable. As the computational section will reveal, the weighting schemes proposed here lead to a substantially improvement in predictive performance of our method over random forest on all but one data set, arguably due to the fact that our method because it leverages the accuracy of the learning algorithm through selecting many good models (since the weighting scheme allows good variables to be selected more often and therefore leads to near optimal base learners)."}, {"heading": "2. Related Work", "text": "Traditionally, in a prediction problem, a single model is built based on the training set and the prediction is decided based solely on this single fitted model. However, in bagging, bootstrap samples are taken from the data set, then, for each instance, the model is fitted. Finally, the prediction is made based on the average of all bagged models. Mathematically, the prediction accuracy for the constructed model using bagging outperforms the traditional model and in the worst case it has the same performance. However, it must be said that it depends on the stability of the modeling procedure. It turns out that bagging reduces the variance without affecting the bias, thereby leading to an overall reduction in prediction error, and hence its great appeal. Any\nset of predictive models can be used as an ensemble in the sense defined earlier. There are many ensemble learning approaches. These approaches could be categorized into four classes: (1) algorithms that use heterogeneous predictive models such as stacking (Wolpert, 1992). (2) algorithms that manipulate the instances of the data sets such as bagging (Breiman, 1996), boosting (Freund & Schapire, 1996), random forests (Breiman, 2001), and bagging with subspaces (Panov & Dzeroski, 2007). (3) algorithms that maniplulate the features of the data sets such as random forests (Breiman, 2001), random subspaces (Ho, 1998), and bagging with subspaces (Panov & Dzeroski, 2007). (4) algorithms that manipulate the learning algorithm such as random forests (Breiman, 2001), neural networks ensemble (Hansen & Salamon, 1990), and extra-trees ensemble (Geurts et al., 2006). Since our proposed algorithm manipulates both the instances and features of the data sets, we will focus on the algorithms in the second and third categories (Breiman, 1996; 2001; Panov & Dzeroski, 2007; Ho, 1998).\nBagging (Breiman, 1996), or bootstrap aggregating is an ensemble learning method that generates multiple predictive models. These models are based on performing bootstrap replicates of the learning (training) data set and utilizing from each replicate to build a separate predictive model. The bootstrap sample is attained through randomly (uniformly) sampling with replacement from instances of the training data set. The decision is made based on averaging the predictor classifiers in regression task and taking the majority vote in classification task. Bagging tend to decrease the variance and keeps the bias as in the case of a single classifier. The bagging accuracy increases when the applied learner is unstable, which means that for any small fluctuation on the training data set causes large impact on the test data set such as trees (Breiman, 1996). Random forests (Breiman, 2001), is an ensemble learning method that averages the prediction results from multiple independent predictor (tree) models. It also performs bootstrap replicates, like bagging (Breiman, 1996), to construct different predictors. For each node of the tree, randomly selecting subset of the attributes. It is considered to improve over bagging through de-correlating the trees. Choose the best attribute from the selected subset. As (Denil et al., 2014) mentions that when building a random tree, there are three issues that should be decided in advance; (1) the leafs splitting method, (2) the type of predictor, and 3- the randomness method. Random subspace learning (Ho, 1998), is an ensemble learning method that constructs base models based on different features. It chooses a subset of features and then learns the base model depending only on these features. The random subspaces reaches the highest accuracy when the number of features is large as well as the number of instances. In addition, it performs good\nwhen there are redundant features on the data set. Bagging subspaces (Panov & Dzeroski, 2007), is an ensemble learning method that combines both the bagging (Breiman, 1996) and random subspaces (Ho, 1998) learning methods. It generates a bootstrap replicates of the training data set, in the same way as bagging. Then, it randomly chooses a subset from the features, in the same manner as random subspaces. It outperforms the bagging and random subspaces. Also, it is found to yield the same performance as random forests in case of using decision tree as a base learner. In the simulation part of this paper, we aim to answer the following research questions: (1) Is the performance of the adaptive random subspace learning (RSSL) better than the performance of single classifiers? (2) What is the performance of the adaptive RSSL compared to the most widely used classifier ensembles? (3) Is there a theoretical explanation as to why adaptive RSSL works well for most of the simulated and real-life data sets? (4) How does adaptive RSSL perform on different parameter settings and with various percentages of the instance-to-feature ratio (IFR)? (5) How does the correlation between features affect the predictive performance of adaptive RSSL?"}, {"heading": "3.

Problem formulation", "text": "As we said earlier our proposed method belongs to the category of random subspace learning where each base learner is constructed using a bootstrap sample and a subset of the original p features. The main difference here is that we use base learners that are typically considered not to lead to any improvement when aggregated, and we also select features using weighting schemes that inspired for the strength of the relationship between each feature and the response (target). Each base learner is driven by the subset { j(l)1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , j (l) d } \u2282 {1,2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , p} of d variables of predictors that are randomly select to build it, and the subsample D (l) drawn with replacement from D .
