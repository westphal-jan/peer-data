To deal with the challenges of such applications an Information Fusion and Probabilistic Decision Making Framework has been designed to cross the large gap between beliefs and decision making. At the bottom layer of such framework we use DSmT for information fusion that yields not only more realistic beliefs but also reliable pignistic probabilities for the underlying propositions. The second layer performs the pignistic probability, BetP{.}, computation. Such BetP{.} is used for the integration of the information fusion with the Bayesian network that occupies the third layer. Such architecture provides probabilistic inference and enables decision making on the basis of both belief based probabilities for the underlying propositions and Bayesian based probabilities for the corresponding reasons Figure (1).\nActually the proposed framework builds up smoothly a probability structure that\ncan be passed to the higher layer. The event (observation) of highest probability is passed to the higher layer where a Bayesian network can provide probabilistic reasoning [Weise et al., 1993]. For convenience, this approach is used to perform reasoning rather than using descriptive logic or a truth maintenance technique. Finally the decisions at the human computer interface are ranked rather than being expressed flat in order to support the decision maker.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the related work to the\nproposed framework, while section 3 presents the problem statement.

An outcome typically includes an improvement in accuracy, higher confidence through complementary information, or improved performance in the presence of countermeasures [Blasch et al., 2002]. IF can occur on multiple levels [Klein, 2004]. Sensor-level fusion is the level at which relevant data is extracted from the source signal.

For this reason a concept of the combination of these two approaches has been presented and a comparison of hard-decision fusion, DSmT fusion and a combination of DSmT and ontology fusion algorithms has been established.\nThe authors of [Sumari et al., 2008] have designed and implemented a hierarchical\nmulti-agent based information fusion system for decision making. The information fusion is implemented by applying a maximum score of the total sum of joint probabilities and is done by a collection of Information Fusion Agents (IFA) that forms a multiagent system.

This work includes a method called DS/AHP which extended the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method of Saaty [Saaty, 1990] with Dempster- Shafer Theory (DST) of belief functions so that it can take into account uncertainty and to manage the conflicts between expert\u2019s opinions within a hierarchical model approach.\nThe authors of [Smarandache et al., 2009] have investigated the possibility to use\n(DSmT) of plausible and paradoxical reasoning for overcoming DST limitations.

The DSm cardinality of any element A \u2208 D\u0398, denoted , corresponds to the number of parts of A in the Venn diagram of the problem (model M) taking into account the set of integrity constraints (if any), i.e. all the possible intersections due to the nature of the elements \u03b8i. This intrinsic cardinality depends on the model M (free, hybrid or Shafer\u2019s model).

Actually is easy to compute by programming from the algorithm of generation of D \u0398 [Dezert, 2003]. If one imposes a constraint that a set B from D \u0398 is empty (i.e. we choose a hybrid model), then one suppresses the columns corresponding to the parts which compose B in the matrix Dn and the row of B and the rows of all elements of D \u0398 which are subsets of B, getting a new matrix D\u02b9n which represents a new hybrid model M \u02b9."}, {"heading": "5.2 A 3D example with a given hybrid model", "text": "Consider now a 3D example in which we force all possible conjunctions to be empty, but \u03b81\u2229\u03b82 according to the following Venn diagram shown in Figure (3).\nThen, one gets the following list of elements (with their DSm cardinal) for\nthe restricted D \u0398 taking into account the integrity constraints of this hybrid model:\nTable (1) Cardinality for the chosen hybrid model M f\nA \u2208 D\u0398 \u03b10 0 \u03b11 \u03b81\u2229\u03b82 1 \u03b12 \u03b83 1 \u03b13 \u03b81 2 \u03b14 \u03b82 2 \u03b15 \u03b81\u222a\u03b82 3\n\u03b16 \u03b81\u222a\u03b83 3 \u03b17 \u03b82\u222a\u03b83 3\n\u03b18 \u03b81\u222a\u03b82\u222a\u03b83 4\n6- Probabilistic reasoning using Bayesian network\nFigure (3) Venn diagram of a DSm hybrid model for a 3D frame\nDepending on the belief analysis, the pignistic probability of the corresponding\nevent could be computed by the proposed model. However, in many situations such probability is not sufficient for the application user. For instance, if the application is medical it will represent the probability of a \u2018symptom\u2019, as advised by multiple experts but we still have the question: what is the probability of the \u2018disease\u2019, which caused such symptom?\nThe question is answered in the proposed framework model by making use of a\nBayesian Network, BN, to represent the dependencies among variables in order to provide a concise specification of any joint probability distribution. The underlying BN takes the pignistic probability of an event as input and computes a corresponding expectation probability depending on both its topology and the conditional probability tables.\nA BN as a directed graph, in which each node is annotated with quantitative\nprobability information could perform the reasoning process. The full specification of BN is as follows:\n1- A set of random variables makes up the nodes of the network. Variables may be discrete or continuous.\n2- A set of directed links or arrows connects pairs of nodes. If there is an arrow from node X to node Y, X is said to be a parent of Y.\n3- Each node X, has a conditional probability distribution P(X | Parents(X)) that quantities the effect of the parents on the node.\n4- The graph has no directed cycles and hence is a directed, acyclic graph, or DAG).\nThe topology of the network specifies the conditional independence relationships\nthat hold in the domain. The intuitive meaning of an arrow in a properly constructed network is usually that X has a direct influence on Y. It is usually easy for a domain expert to decide what direct influences exist in the domain- much easier, in fact, than actually specifying the probabilities themselves.\nOnce the topology of the Bayesian network is laid out, we need only to specify a\nconditional probability distribution for each variable, given its parents. Here the combination of the topology and the conditional distributions suffices to specify the full joint distribution for all the variables. Eventually, the output of BN is passed to the user interface in prder to support his current decisions."}, {"heading": "7- Case study", "text": ""}, {"heading": "7.1 Experimental setup", "text": "Figure (4) presents the environment (hardware, software, and the connection)\nof the implementation of the proposed framework model.\nIts configuration can be described as follows:\n1- Hardware configuration\na.

This comparison as such, has pointed out the significance of the proposed framework features. These features confirm the fact that the proposed framework only represents a complete realization for all the model layers, Figure (1). This ensures its superiority to support decision making. In this comparative study the proposed framework is compared with the identity fusion algorithm [Jousselme et al., 2003] and the multi-agent information fusion system [Sumari et al., 2008].\nTable (12) Comparative study between the proposed framework and other information\nfusion systems\nModel\nProperty\nthe proposed\nframework\nIdentity fusion algorithm\n[Jousselme et al., 2003]\nMulti-Agent\nInformation Fusion Systems [Sumari et\nal., 2008]\nMain application area(s)\n- Anti-terrorism - Spy war - Security negotiations\nDirect fleet support scenarios where raw data reports are time dependent Military operations\nThe information fusion technique\nUse of Dezert Smarandache Theory, DSmT.\nActually, DSmT is applicable for \u201cboth\u201d free and hybrid models that permit \u03b8i\u2019s of \u0398 to be intersected.\nUse of Dempster Shafer theory of evidence for combining information coming from different sources.\nThis theory is applicable \u201conly\u201d for free models in which \u03b8i\u2019s of \u0398 should be exclusive and exhaustive.\nThe theory of evidence is not taken into consideration; consequently, no beliefs are calculated to be relied upon. Information fusion is based on the JDL model that has been carried out in four levels.\nInformation management to support decision making\nOn the basis of two levels:\n- Credal for combination of beliefs. - Pignistic for supporting probabilistic reasoning.\nThe pignistic probability has been computed to specify the trust in belief functions after information fusion and to support the Bayesian network probabilistic reasoning.\nComputes basic probability assignments, BPAs and the successive BPA\u2019s are combined through Dempster\u2019s rule. This process is implemented by applying maximum score of the total sum of joint probabilistic\nfusion method.\nDecision making By performing probabilistic reasoning\nusing a Bayesian network that can obtain the probable reason of a proposition from its pignistic probability. Thus the DSmT pignistic probability can serve two folds: 1-Accuracy measure for\nthe underlying beliefs.\n2-Input to the Bayesian\nnetwork providing a conformal integration (i.e. decision might be changed when the basic beliefs are changed) between the belief and the probabilistic reasoning model.\nDecision is taken for the identification/classificatio n of an object from a database based on the maximum value of pignistic probability criterion. Bayes formulation can produce an inference concerning an observed object viewed from existing events. Then the a posteriori conditional\nprobability for each object calculated, one can decide the best estimated hypothesis by taking the greatest posteriori conditional probability value.\nEvidence based reasoning\nCan obtain the reason behind the believed hypothesis. Cannot obtain the reason behind the believed hypothesis. Does not depend on beliefs and does not use evidence theory.\nRanking the output decisions\nRanking the system decisions is ultimately used to support decision making Decision is taken based on the maximum value of pignistic probability. There is no ranking of output decisions; only one can decide the best estimated hypothesis\nby taking the greatest value of a posteriori conditional probability calculated by the Bayesian network."}, {"heading": "8- Conclusion", "text": "Since it is not an easy task to obtain high-level decisions from computed beliefs,\nthe proposed framework has been designed and implemented as Information Fusion and Probabilistic Decision Making Framework. Such framework consistes of the following layers:\n1. A layer that contains a belief computation agent for estimating the basic belief assignments.\n2. A layer for combination of basic belief assignments using an information fusion approach. Such approach exploits Dezert-Smarandache Theory, DSmT, and\nproportional conflict redistribution to provide more realistic final beliefs.\n3. A layer for computation of pignistic probability of the underlying propositions from the corresponding final beliefs.\n4. A layer for performing probabilistic reasoning using a Bayesian network that can obtain the probable reason of a proposition from its pignistic probability.\n5. A layer for ranking the system decisions is ultimately used to support decision making.\nA case study is investigated in details. It has proved the concept of the proposed\nframework and indicated the following:\n1. The use of DSmT for information fusion yields not only more realistic beliefs but also reliable pignistic probabilities for the underlying propositions.\n2. Making use of pignistic probabilities to integrate information fusion and the Bayesian network. By this way we could provide probabilistic inference and\nenable decision making that exploits both belief based probabilities for the underlying propositions and conditional probabilities of BN for finding out the corresponding reasons.\n3. A divide and conquer approach can considerably reduce the problem size. Such approach can transfer a problem with impractical large size due to large number\nof focal elements to a set of familiar 3D subproblems that can be easily tackled with reasonable time and space costs.\nA comparative study with respect to other information fusion systems has pointed\nout the significance of the proposed framework which makes it able to outperform similar decision making systems.\nReferences\n[Beynon, 2005] M.

This paper aims at designing a new multi-layer framework that can support the process of performing decisions from the obtained beliefs using information fusion. Since it is not an easy task to cross the gap between computed beliefs of certain hypothesis and decisions, the proposed framework consists of the following layers in order to provide a suitable architecture (ordered bottom up): 1. A layer for combination of basic belief assignments using an information fusion approach. Such approach exploits Dezert-Smarandache Theory, DSmT, and proportional conflict redistribution to provide more realistic final beliefs. 2. A layer for computation of pignistic probability of the underlying propositions from the corresponding final beliefs. 3. A layer for performing probabilistic reasoning using a Bayesian network that can obtain the probable reason of a proposition from its pignistic probability. 4. Ranking the system decisions is ultimately used to support decision making. A case study has been accomplished at various operational conditions in order to prove the concept, in addition it pointed out that: 1. The use of DSmT for information fusion yields not only more realistic beliefs but also reliable pignistic probabilities for the underlying propositions. 2. Exploiting the pignistic probability for the integration of the information fusion with the Bayesian network provides probabilistic inference and enable decision making on the basis of both belief based probabilities for the underlying propositions and Bayesian based probabilities for the corresponding reasons.
