This is a virus born disease caused by breeding of Aedes mosquito. Datasets that are available for dengue describe information about the patients suffering with dengue disease and without dengue disease along with their symptoms like: Fever Temperature, WBC, Platelets, Severe Headache, Vomiting, Metallic Taste, Joint Pain, Appetite, Diarrhea, Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, and how many days suffer in different city. In this paper we discuss various algorithm approaches of data mining that have been utilized for dengue disease prediction. Data mining is a well known technique used by health organizations for classification of diseases such as dengue, diabetes and cancer in bioinformatics research. In the proposed approach we have used WEKA with 10 cross validation to evaluate data and compare results. Weka has an extensive collection of different machine learning and data mining algorithms. In this paper we have firstly classified the dengue data set and then compared the different data mining techniques in weka through Explorer, knowledge flow and Experimenter interfaces. Furthermore in order to validate our approach we have used a dengue dataset with 108 instances but weka used 99 rows and 18 attributes to determine the prediction of disease and their accuracy using classifications of different algorithms to find out the best performance. The main objective of this paper is to classify data and assist the users in extracting useful information from data and easily identify a suitable algorithm for accurate predictive model from it. From the findings of this paper it can be concluded that Na\u00efve Bayes and J48 are the best performance algorithms for classified accuracy because they achieved maximum accuracy= 100% with 99 correctly classified instances, maximum ROC = 1 , had least mean absolute error and it took minimum time for building this model through Explorer and Knowledge flow results.\nKeywords: Weka; Dengue disease prediction; Data mining; Classification."}, {"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "Dengue fever is a disease caused by dengue virus and is also known as break bone fever is transmitted by Aedes mosquito. Infection of dengue is divided into four part DHF I, DHF II, DHF II, DHF IV. It causes life threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever whose symptoms include bleeding, low levels of blood platelets, low blood pressure, metallic taste in mouth, headache, muscle joint pain and rashes.11, 22 There is no specific medicine or antibiotic available to treat it. Dengue fever occurs in form of cycles and this cycle is present inside the body of an infected person for two week or less than two week. It causes abdominal pain, hemorrhage (bleeding), and circulatory collapse and Dengue hemorrhagic fever.\nKashish Ara Shakil, Shadma Anis and Mansaf Alam, 2\nThe following is the cycle mechanism by which dengue is transmitted: Aedes mosquito carries a virus in its saliva, when it bites a healthy person, that virus enters the person\u2019s body and gets mixed with the person\u2019s body fluids. The moment white blood vessels gets mixed with the single stranded RNA dengue virus, it starts reproducing inside the white blood cells and thus initiates the dengue virus cycle. In case of severe infection, the duration of virus cycle is prolonged and thereby affects liver and bone marrow leading to less blood circulation in blood vessels, and the blood pressure becomes so low that it cannot supply sufficient blood to all the organs of the body. The bone marrow also does not function properly due to this infection leading to reduced number of platelets and increased risk of bleeding, which are necessary for effective blood clotting.11 Bioinformatics research area uses weka tool for solving many data mining problems. Weka stands for Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis developed at the university of Waikato in New Zealand and was implemented in 1997 the software freely available at http://www.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka and written in java language. There are several different levels at which weka can be used. Weka contains modules for data classification and accuracy to predict diseases.13Weka has been used in bioinformatics for diagnoses and analysis of dengue disease datasets. Weka has 49 tools for processing, 76 algorithms for classification and regression, 8 algorithms for clustering, and 3algorithms for finding association rules. Weka algorithms are suitable for generating predictive model accurately by extracting useful information from dengue dataset through WEKA.4 Apart from weka researchers are now moving towards cloud computing for disease predictions. 23,24,25,28 It also offers facilities such as clustering and analysis of huge datasets. 26,27,29,30The main focus of this paper is dengue disease prediction using weka data mining tool and its usage for classification in the field of medical bioinformatics. It firstly classifies dataset and then determines which algorithm performs best for diagnosis and prediction of dengue disease. From the findings of the experiments conducted it was revealed that Na\u00efve Bayes and J48 are the best algorithms. The posterior probability of a hypothesis can be estimated using Bayesian reasoning of some given knowledge or data.31 Prediction begins with identification of symptoms in patients and then identifying sick patients from a lot of sick and healthy ones. Thus, the prime objective of this paper is analysis of data from a dengue dataset classification technique to predict class accurately in each case in data. The major contributions of this paper are:\n(1) To extract useful classified accuracy for prediction of dengue diseases. (2) Comparison of different data mining algorithms on dengue dataset. (3) Identify the best performance algorithm for prediction of diseases.\nIn this paper we have used dengue dataset for classification method. The steps followed include collection of the dataset for determining the accuracy, classification and then comparison of results. The dataset has been used to classify the following dengue attributes based on P.I.D, date of dengue fever, days, current temperature, WBC, joint muscles, metallic taste in mouth, appetite, abdomen pain, Nausea, diarrhea and hemoglobin. Several classification algorithms have been used in this paper in order to analyze the performance of applied algorithm on the given dataset but the thrust in this\nDengue Disease Prediction Using Weka Data Mining Tool 3\npaper is on accuracy measure. Accuracy measures analyze the errors through measures like root mean square error, relative absolute error and correctly classified instances. Though data mining has several different algorithms to analyze data but analysis using all the methods is not feasible therefore in this paper we have performed the analysis using Na\u00efve Bays, J48 tree, SMO function, REP Tree and Random Tree algorithms by using Explorer, Experimenter and knowledge flow interface of weka tool. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents related work done using data mining tools such as weka and CRFSuite to predict diseases; Section 3 describes the methodology adopted by us. Furthermore section 4 presents the Dengue Dataset used in this paper for analysis purpose; Section 5 describes data mining techniques used in this paper for analysis; Result and Discussions are presented in section 6, finally the paper ends with Conclusion and future works in section 7."}, {"heading": "2.

With the help of data mining techniques they have predicted and analyzed liver diseases using weka tool. They have also compared the outputs obtained from Na\u00efve Bayes and FT tree algorithms and concluded that Naive Bayes algorithm plays a key role in predicting liver diseases.1 Solanki A.V. has used weka as a data mining technique for classification of sickle cell disease prevalent in Gujarat. They have compared J48 and Random tree algorithms and have given a predictive model for classification with respect to a person\u2019s age of different blood group types. From there experimentation it can be inferred that Random tree is better algorithm as it produces more depth decisions respect to J48 for sickle cell diseases.2 Joshi et al. has done diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer using classification rules. By comparing classification rules such as Bayes Net, Logistic, Multilayer Perceptron, SGD, Simple Logistic, SMO, AdaBoostM1, Attribute Selected, Classification via Regression, Filtered Classifier, Multiclass Classifier and J48,They have inferred that LMT Classifier gives more accurate diagnosis i.e. 76 % healthy and 24 % sick patients.3 David S.K. et al. have used classification techniques for leukemia disease prediction. KNearest Neighbor, Bayesian Network, Random tree, J48 tree compared on the basis of accuracy, learning time and error rate. According to them Bayesian algorithm has better classification accuracy amongst others.4 Vijayarani S. and Sudha S. have compared the analysis of classification function techniques for heart disease prediction. Classification was done using algorithms such as Logistic, Multilayer Perception and Sequential Minimal Optimization algorithms for predicting heart disease. In this classification comparison logistic algorithm trained out to be best classifier for heart disease having more accuracy and least error rate.5 Kumar M.N. used alternating decision trees for early diagnosis of dengue fever. The ADTree correctly classifies 84 % of cases as compared to J48 which can classify only 78% of cases correctly.6\nKashish Ara Shakil, Shadma Anis and Mansaf Alam, 4\nDurairaj M. and Ranjani V. have compared different data mining applications in healthcare sector. Algorithms such as Na\u00efve, J48, KNN and C4.5 were used for Classification in order to diagnose diseases like Heart Disease, Cancer, AIDS, Brain Cancer, Diabetes, Kidney Dialysis, Dengue, IVF and Hepatitis C. Comparison study analysis revealed high accuracy i.e. 97.77% for cancer prediction and around 70% for IVF treatment through data mining techniques.7 Sugandhi C. et al. analyzed a population of cataract patient\u2019s database by weka tool. In this study, weka has been used to classify the results and for comparison purpose. They have concluded that Random Tree gives 84% classify accuracy which means better performance as compared to other algorithms used for classification accuracy performance of Na\u00efve Bayes, SMO, J48, REP Tree and Random Tree. Thus according to their study Random Tree is the best performance classification algorithm for cataract patient disease.8 Yasodha P. and Kannan M. performed analysis of a population of diabetic patient database using weka tool. They have classified the data and then outputs were compared by using Bayes Network, REP Tree, J48 and Random Tree algorithms. Finally the results conclude that these algorithms help to determine and identify the stage or state in which a of disease like diabetes is in by entering patients daily glucose rate and insulin dosages thereby predicting and consulting the patients for their next insulin dosage .9 Bin Othman M.F. and Yau T.M.S. have compared different classification techniques using weka for Breast cancer. In this study they have used different algorithm methods for simulating results of each algorithm and its training. They have simulated the errors by using Bayes Network, Radial Basis function, Decision Tree and pruning and Single Conjugation Rule Learner algorithms. From their work it can be concluded that Bayes Network performs best for breast cancer data. Its time taken to build model is 0.19 second and accuracy 89.7 % and least error at 0.2140 as compared to other algorithms used .10 Mihaila C. and Ananiadou S. have compared two data mining tools i.e. weka and CRF Suite on the basis of features like Lexical, Syntactic and semantic with various parameters to compare their impacts on each algorithm. The experiments have been employed in CRF Suite implementation by using Conditional Random Field algorithm and in weka by algorithms like Support Vector machine and Random Forests to identify discourse causality trigger in the biomedical domain. Classification tasks have been performed on the basis of statistics such as F score, precision and recall. As per them CRF is the best performance classifier, achieved F score = 79.35 % by combining three features as compared to other classifier.21 Thitiprayoonwonsge D. et al. have analyzed dengue infection using data mining decision tree. In this paper two datasets have been used from two different hospitals Srinagarindra Hospital and Songklanagarind Hospital, each having more than 400 attributes. Four classification algorithms have been used in this paper for experimental purpose. The first and second experiment test got an accuracy of 97.6% and 96.6%. The third experiment extracts useful knowledge. Another objective of this paper was to detect day abatement of\nDengue Disease Prediction Using Weka Data Mining Tool 5\nfever also referred as day0. In fourth experiment of day0 accuracy is very low as compared to other three experiments. Therefore physician need day0 amongst patient in order to treat them.22"}, {"heading": "3. Methodology", "text": "In order to carry out experimentations and implementations Weka was used as the data mining tool. Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) is a data mining tool written in java developed at Waikato. WEKA is a very good data mining tool for the users to classify the accuracy on the basis of datasets by applying different algorithmic approaches and compared in the field of bioinformatics. Explorer, Experimenter and Knowledge flow are the interface available in WEKA that has been used by us. In this paper we have used these data mining techniques to predict the survivability of dengue disease through classification of different algorithms accuracy . 12, 13 Figure 1 visualizes the interface of WEKA Data mining tool. It has four applications: (1)Explorer: The explorer interface has several panels like preprocess, classify, cluster, associate, select attribute and visualize. But in this interface our main focus is on the Classification Panel .12 (2) Experimenter: This interface provides facility for systematic comparison of different algorithms on basis of given datasets. Each algorithm runs 10 times and then the accuracy reported.12 (3)Knowledge Flow: It is an alternative to the explorer interface. The only difference between this and others is that here user selects Weka component from toolbar and connects them to make a layout for running the algorithms .12 (4) Simple CLI: Simple CLI means command line interface. User performs operations through a command line interface by giving instructions to the operating system. This interface is less popular as compared to other three.\nKashish Ara Shakil, Shadma Anis and Mansaf Alam, 6\n3.1 Classification In data mining tools classification deals with identifying the problem by observing characteristics of diseases amongst patients and diagnose or predict which algorithm shows best performance on the basis of WEKA\u2019s statistical output .20 Table 1 shows the WEKA data mining techniques that have been used in this paper along with other prerequisites like data set format etc. by using different algorithms.\nThree techniques have been adopted in this paper, the first technique uses explorer interface and depends on algorithms like Na\u00efve Bayes, SMO, J48, REP Tree and RANDOM Tree, used in areas to represent, utilize and learn the statistical knowledge and significant results have been achieved. The second technique uses Experimenter interface. This study allows one to design experiments for running algorithms such as Na\u00efve Bayes, J48, REP Tree and RANDOM Tree on datasets. These algorithms can be run on experimenter and analyze the results. It configures the test option to use cross validation 10 folds. This interface provides provision for running all the algorithms together and thus a comparative result was obtained. The third technique uses Knowledge Flow. In this study we classified the accuracy of different algorithms Na\u00efve Bayes, SMO, J48, REP Tree and random Tree on different data sets and compared the results to know which algorithm shows best performance. In order to predict Dengue Disease for survivability by user one can select this weka component from toolbar, place them in a layout like manner and connect its different components together in order to form a knowledge flow web for preprocessing and analyzing data. All the algorithms used by us were applied to a dengue data set explained in detail in section 4. In order to obtain better accuracy 10 fold cross validation was performed. For each classification we selected training and testing sample randomly from the base set to train the model and then test it in order to estimate the classification and accuracy measure for each classifier.

Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "The main aim of this paper is to predict dengue disease using WEKA data mining tool. It has four interfaces. Out of these four we have used three interfaces: Explorer, Experimenter and knowledge flow. Each interface has its own classifier algorithms. We have used five algorithms i.e. Na\u00efve Bayes, J48, SMO, REP Tree and Random tree for our experimentation. Then these algorithms were implemented using WEKA data mining technique to analyze algorithm accuracy which was obtained after running these algorithms in the output window. After running these algorithms the outputs were compared on the basis of accuracy achieved. In Explorer and Knowledge flow there are several scoring algorithms for accuracy but for our experimentation we have used only five algorithms. The outputs obtained from both Explorer and Knowledge flow is approximately same because knowledge flow is an alternative method of Explorer. It is just a different way of carrying out experimentations. These algorithms compare classifier accuracy to each other on the basis of correctly classified instances, time taken to build model, mean absolute error and ROC Area. Through Explorer and Knowledge Flow technique it was inferred that Nave Bayes and J48 are the best performance classifier algorithms as they achieved an accuracy of 100 %, takes less time taken to build and shows maximum ROC area = 1, and had least\nKashish Ara Shakil, Shadma Anis and Mansaf Alam, 24\nabsolute error. Maximum ROC Area means excellent predictions performance as compared to other algorithms.\nExperimenter result showed that scoring accuracy of Na\u00efve Bayes is 100% and J48 is 99.70% as compared to REP tree and Random tree so we can conclude that in Experimenter interface Na\u00efve Bayes and J48 are the best classifier algorithms for accuracy predictions for dengue disease survivability on the basis of symptoms given in dataset among patients.\nThe applications of Weka can be extended further to medical field for diagnosis of different diseases like cancer and many others. It can also help in solving the problems of clinical research using different applications of Weka. Another advantage of using Weka for prediction of diseases is that it can easily diagnose a disease even in case when the number of patients for whom the prediction has to be done is huge or in case of very large data sets spanning lakhs of patients. Even though Weka is a powerful data mining tool to analyze the overview of classification, clustering, Association Rule Mining and visualization of result in medical health to predict disease among patient but we can use other tools such as Matlab in order to further classify different data sets .The proposed approach is used with dengue data set but we plan to extend this approach in future for prediction of other diseases such as cancer etc."}], "references": [{"title": "Liver Disease Prediction Using Bayesian Classification", "author": ["S Dhamodharan"], "venue": "Special Issues , 4th National Conference on Advance Computing , Application Technologies,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Diagnosis And Prognosis of Breast Cancer Using Classification", "author": ["J Joshi", "D Rinal", "J Patel"], "venue": "Rules, International Journal of Engineering Research and General", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Comparative Analysis of Data Mining Tools and Classification Techniques using WEKA in Medical Bioinformatics, Computer Engineering and Intelligent Systems, 4(13):28-38,2013", "author": ["K.

This is a virus born disease caused by breeding of Aedes mosquito. Datasets that are available for dengue describe information about the patients suffering with dengue disease and without dengue disease along with their symptoms like: Fever Temperature, WBC, Platelets, Severe Headache, Vomiting, Metallic Taste, Joint Pain, Appetite, Diarrhea, Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, and how many days suffer in different city. In this paper we discuss various algorithm approaches of data mining that have been utilized for dengue disease prediction. Data mining is a well known technique used by health organizations for classification of diseases such as dengue, diabetes and cancer in bioinformatics research. In the proposed approach we have used WEKA with 10 cross validation to evaluate data and compare results. Weka has an extensive collection of different machine learning and data mining algorithms. In this paper we have firstly classified the dengue data set and then compared the different data mining techniques in weka through Explorer, knowledge flow and Experimenter interfaces. Furthermore in order to validate our approach we have used a dengue dataset with 108 instances but weka used 99 rows and 18 attributes to determine the prediction of disease and their accuracy using classifications of different algorithms to find out the best performance. The main objective of this paper is to classify data and assist the users in extracting useful information from data and easily identify a suitable algorithm for accurate predictive model from it. From the findings of this paper it can be concluded that Na\u00efve Bayes and J48 are the best performance algorithms for classified accuracy because they achieved maximum accuracy= 100% with 99 correctly classified instances, maximum ROC = 1 , had least mean absolute error and it took minimum time for building this model through Explorer and Knowledge flow results.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007"}}}
