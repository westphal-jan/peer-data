Judgment aggregation can be seen as a generalisation of preference aggregation and voting. The formal connection between judgment aggregation and preference aggregation makes use of the preference agenda [5]: given a set of alternatives C, this agenda is composed of propositions of the form \u201cx is preferred to y\u201d, where x and y are alternatives in C; a profile corresponds to a set of individual judgments, whose consistency condition corresponds to the transitivity of the individual votes. This connection raises several natural questions:\n1. when can we say that a judgment aggregation rule is a generalisation of a voting rule?\n\u22c6 Gabriella Pigozzi and Srdjan Vesic benefited from the support of the project AMANDE ANR-13-BS02-0004 of the French National Research Agency (ANR).\n2. how can we lift properties from voting rules to judgment aggregation rules?\n3. how can we classify judgment aggregation rules with respect to the properties they satisfy?\nBefore considering these questions, certain observations regarding the judgment aggregation literature have to be made. This literature has focused considerably more on studying impossibility theorems, rather than on developing and studying specific aggregation rules, a field development approach that departs from the, admittedly much older, field of voting theory. Nevertheless, several recent, independent, works have started to explore the zoo of interesting, concrete judgment aggregation rules, beyond the well known premise-based and conclusion-based rules. Recall that the premise- and conclusion-based rules can only be applied if there exists a prior labelling of the agenda issues as premises and conclusions. The following rules are defined for any agenda: quota-based rules [6], distance-based rules [17,10,8], or rules that are based on the maximisation of some scoring function [19,18,13,4,25].\nSome of the newly proposed rules are defined by an obvious analogy with well-known voting rules. E.g., the so-called Young rule [13], that looks for a minimum number of agents to remove so that the resulting profile becomes majority-consistent, is the obvious counterpart of the Young voting rule. For a few other rules, the analogy remains clear, but the formal connection is less trivial to establish. The generalisation of scoring rules to judgment aggregation [4] falls in that category. For a few other rules, the analogy itself is not obvious.\nQuestions 1 and 2 are highly related and nontrivial. The answer primarily depends on whether the collective judgment set should be consistent with the transitivity constraint, or only with the constraint expressing the existence of a non-dominated alternative. Question 3 can be answered in a similar way as in voting theory. That is, voting rules can be classified according to the property they satisfy (such as Condorcet-consistency) or to their informational needs: for instance, so-called \u201cC1\u201d rules are voting rules for which knowing the pairwise majority relation between alternatives is enough to determine the winner(s); for \u201cC2\u201d rules, the information needed to determine the winner(s) is the number of voters who rank x ahead of y, for all pairs of alternatives x and y; for scoring rules, the information needed is the number of voters who rank alternative x in position k for all x and k; and so on. From the questions we outlined, the first and third question are evidently not such that can be fully addressed in a single paper.\nWe focus here on proposing the necessary formalisms for addressing these questions and we focus our efforts on one property, majority-preservation.Majoritypreservation is the natural generalisation to judgment aggregation of the arguably most important property in voting, Condorcet-consistency. While a voting rule is Condorcet-consistent if it outputs the Condorcet winner (and no other alternative) whenever there exists one, a judgment aggregation rule is majority-preserving if it outputs the majoritarian judgment set (determined by issue-wise majority) whenever it is consistent. In addition, we also generalise two\nalso important properties from voting to judgment aggregation: unanimity and monotonicity.\nWe follow earlier work in judgment aggregation [15] in using a constraintbased version of judgment aggregation to represent properties like transitivity of preferences. As it is common in voting theory, we use irresolute rules (also called \u2018correspondences\u2019) rather than functions, that is, a rule outputs a non-empty set of collective judgments. This represents, as common in voting, that there may be a tie between the collective judgments: an irresolute judgment aggregation rule is a function that given an agenda, a constraint, a number of voters, and for each voter an individual judgment (a subset of the agenda consistent with the constraint), gives a set of collective judgments (subsets of the agenda consistent with the constraint). We address the question of relations between voting and judgment aggregation rules in full detail: we define a formal way of mapping a judgment aggregation rule to two voting rules, obtained by requiring the collective judgment to be consistent with the transitivity constraint, or with the (weaker) existence of a non-dominated alternative. It is rather intriguing to see which pairs of well-known voting rules correspond to the same judgment aggregation rule. For instance, as we show, the Copeland rule comes together with the Slater rule, whereas the maximin rule comes together with the \u201cranked pairs\u201d rule.\nThe last objective of the paper is to compare the majority-preserving judgment aggregation rules along several dimensions and criteria. As it is common in voting theory, we first compare the rules according to their discriminative power: for each pair of rules F and F \u2032, we identify whether the set of judgment sets resulting from the application of F is contained in the set of judgment sets resulting from the application of F \u2032, or vice versa, or if they are incomparable. We later consider whether they satisfy the rest of the unanimity and monotonicity properties.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. The general definitions are given in Section 2. In Section 3 we review the rules we study in the paper and show that they are majority-preserving; we then address inclusion and non inclusion relationships between these rules and relate them to the existing literature; we also mention a few other rules which are not majority-preserving (and are thus excluded from our study). In Section 4 we formally relate judgment aggregation rules to voting rules, and identify the voting rules corresponding to each of the judgment rules studied. In Section 5 we study the rules from the point of view of two key properties (unanimity and monotonicity). We discuss further research in Section 6. Related work is discussed throughout the sections, where it best applies."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "This section introduces the framework we use for judgement aggregation. Let L be a set of well formed propositional logic formulas, including \u22a4 and \u22a5, built from a set of propositional variables Lp using the standard connectives\n\u00ac, \u2227, \u2228, \u2192 and \u2194. A pre-agenda [A] \u2286 L is a set of formulas {\u03d51, . . . , \u03d5m} such that no \u03d5i \u2208 [A] has the form \u00ac\u03c8 for some \u03c8 \u2208 L (that is, no formula in [A] is a negation of a formula from L). The agenda A \u2286 L based on a pre-agenda [A] \u2286 L is defined as A = [A] \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2208 [A]}. For \u03d5 \u2208 A, we define \u03d5 = \u00ac\u03d5 if \u03d5 \u2208 [A] and \u03d5 = \u03c8 if there exists \u03c8 \u2208 [A] such that \u03d5 = \u00ac\u03c8.\nA constraint \u0393 \u2208 L is a formula of L. We say that a set S is \u0393 -consistent if and only if S \u222a {\u0393} is consistent. A set J \u2286 A is said to be complete if and only if for every \u03d5 \u2208 [A] we have \u03d5 \u2208 J or \u00ac\u03d5 \u2208 J . J \u2286 A is incomplete if and only if it is not complete. J \u2286 A is a judgment set based on A and \u0393 , for short a (A, \u0393 )-judgment set, if and only if it is \u0393 -consistent and complete. We denote by D(A, \u0393 ) the set of all (A, \u0393 )-judgment sets.\nAn n-voter profile based on A and \u0393 is a collection of n (A, \u0393 )-judgment sets P = \u3008J1, . . . , Jn\u3009, that is, Ji \u2208 Dn(A, \u0393 ).

For S = {I1, . . . , Ik} with I1 \u2286 A, . . . , Ik \u2286 A, we define CompA,\u0393 (S) = \u222aI\u2208SCompA,\u0393 (I).\nN(P, \u03d5) is the number of agents in P with judgment sets that contain \u03d5, i.e. N(P, \u03d5) = |{i | Ji \u2208 P, \u03d5 \u2208 Ji}|.\nExample 1. Consider the preagenda [A] = {p \u2227 r, q, p \u2227 q}. The corresponding agenda is A = {p \u2227 r,\u00ac(p \u2227 r), q,\u00acq, p \u2227 q,\u00ac(p \u2227 q)}. Let \u0393 = {q \u2192 r} be a constraint for A. The set D(A, \u0393 ) is\nD(A, \u0393 ) =\n{\n{\u00ac(p \u2227 r),\u00acq,\u00ac(p \u2227 q)}, {\u00ac(p \u2227 r), q,\u00ac(p \u2227 q)}, {(p \u2227 r),\u00acq,\u00ac(p \u2227 q)}, {p \u2227 r, q, p \u2227 q}\n}\nAn example of P \u2208 Dn(A, \u0393 ), where n = 3 is P = \u3008{\u00ac(p\u2227r), q,\u00ac(p\u2227q)}, {\u00ac(p\u2227 r), q,\u00ac(p \u2227 q)}, {(p \u2227 r),\u00acq,\u00ac(p \u2227 q)}, {p \u2227 r, q, p \u2227 q}\u3009. Q = \u3008{(p \u2227 r),\u00acq,\u00ac(p \u2227 q)}, {p\u2227 r, q, p \u2227 q}\u3009 is a subprofile of P . If S = {{\u00ac(p\u2227 r),\u00ac(p \u2227 q)}, {p\u2227 r, q}} then CompA,\u0393 (S) = {{\u00ac(p\u2227r), q,\u00ac(p\u2227q)}, {\u00ac(p\u2227r),\u00acq,\u00ac(p\u2227q)}, {p\u2227r, q, p\u2227q}}. Finally, N(P, p \u2227 q) = 1 and N(P,\u00ac(p \u2227 q)) = 3.\nMost often we will write profiles in a table, as the one given in Table 1, equivalent to the P we just stated, with the preagenda elements given in the topmost row and the name of the judgment sets in the leftmost column. If a judgment set contains a \u03d5 \u2208 [A], then we mark this with a \u201c+\u201d in the table, while if a judgment set contains a \u00ac\u03d5 for a \u03d5 \u2208 [A], we mark this with a \u201c-\u201d in the table. The constraint, unless \u22a4, will be the denoted in the table caption.\nWe now define what we consider to be a judgment aggregation rule. We give the definition for a variable agenda and constraint, noting that judgement aggregation rules can also be defined for a specific agenda, constraint, but also number of voters.\nDefinition 1 (Judgment aggregation rule). An (irresolute) judgment aggregation rule, denoted by F , is a is a function that given a number of voters n\nand a n-voter judgment aggregation profile P = \u3008J1, . . . , Jn\u3009, outputs a nonempty set of judgment sets based on A and \u0393 .\nLike in voting theory, resolute rules can be defined from irresolute ones by composing them with a tie-breaking mechanism. We do not pursue this direction here and consider irresolute rules throughout the paper.\nWe classify the judgment aggregation procedures by distinguishing between rules based on the majoritarian judgment set, rules based on the weighted majoritarian judgment set, and rules based on the removal or change of individual judgments. We give the necessary definitions for such classification.\nDefinition 2. The majoritarian judgment set associated with profile P = \u3008J1, . . . , Jn\u3009 contains all elements of the agenda that are supported by a strict majority of judgment sets in P , i.e.,\nm(P ) = { \u03d5 \u2208 A | N(P, \u03d5) > n\n2\n}\nwhere N(P, \u03d5) is the number of agents in P with judgment sets that contain \u03d5, i.e. N(P, \u03d5) = |{i | Ji \u2208 P, \u03d5 \u2208 Ji}|. A profile P based on A and \u0393 is majorityconsistent iff m(P ) is \u0393 -consistent5.\nRoughly, a judgment aggregation rule F is majority-preserving iff F returns only the majoritarian judgment set whenever it is consistent. However, there is one subtlety in the case of ties. For example, when we have agenda A = {p,\u00acp, q,\u00acq} and individual judgments J1 = {p, q} and J2 = {p,\u00acq}, then m(\u3008J1, J2\u3009) = {p}, which is shorthand for two collective judgments, namely {p,\u00acq} and {p, q}.\nExample 2. Consider again the profile from Example 1. We represent this profile in Table 1. m(P ) = {q,\u00ac(p \u2227 q)} is an incomplete subset of A, and we have CompA,\u0393 (m(P )) = {{p \u2227 r, q,\u00ac(p \u2227 q)}, {\u00ac(p \u2227 r), q,\u00ac(p \u2227 q)}}.\nDefinition 3 (Majority-preserving). A judgment aggregation rule F is majoritypreserving iff for every agenda A, for every \u0393 \u2208 L, for every majority-consistent profile P based on A and \u0393 , we have F (P ) = CompA,\u0393 (m(P ))."}, {"heading": "Voters p \u2227 r q p \u2227 q", "text": "We use the following running example to illustrate our judgment aggregation rules in this paper.\n5 The same notion is called Condorcet consistency in [19].\nExample 3.

This family can be viewed as the judgment aggregation counterpart of voting rules that are based on the pairwise majority graph, also known as C1 rules in Fishburn\u2019s classification [1]. Being based on the majoritarian judgment set means that for any P and Q such that m(P ) = m(Q) we have F (P ) = F (Q). Now we define several rules based on the majoritarian judgment set.\nDefinition 4.

The maximal sub-agenda (msa) and the maxcard sub-agenda (mcsa) rules are defined as follows: for every agenda A, for every \u0393 \u2208 L, for every (A, \u0393 )-profile P ,\nmsaA,\u0393 (P ) = CompA,\u0393 (max(m(P ), \u0393,\u2286)), (1) mcsaA,\u0393 (P ) = CompA,\u0393 (max(m(P ), \u0393, |.|)). (2)\nIntuitively, the msa rule operates by removing a minimal set of judgments from m(P ), such that a consistent set is obtained. Note that for each \u03d5 \u2208 m(P ), there exists at least one J \u2208 msa(P ) such that \u03d5 \u2208 J .\nExample 4. Consider the same agenda A and profile P as in Example 3. The maximal \u0393 -consistent subsets of m(P ) are {p \u2227 r, p \u2227 s, q, t}, {p \u2227 r,\u00ac(p \u2227 q), t} and {q,\u00ac(p \u2227 q), t}; therefore\nmsaA,\u22a4(P ) =\n\n\n\n{p \u2227 r, p \u2227 s, q, p \u2227 q, t}, {p \u2227 r, p \u2227 s, \u00acq \u00ac(p \u2227 q), t}, {\u00ac(p \u2227 r), \u00ac(p \u2227 s), q, \u00ac(p \u2227 q), t}\n\n\n\n.\nIntuitively, the mcsa rule operates by removing a minimal number of judgments (with respect to cardinality) from m(P ) so that a consistent set is obtained. Clearly, all the sets selected by mcsa will also be selected by msa, but the reverse does not hold, as it can be witnessed from Example 5.\nmsa and mcsa are clearly majority-preserving.\nExample 5.

[19]6. The rule mcsa coincides with the \u201cSlater rule\u201d [19], and with the EndpointdH rule [17].

Rules of this family are sensitive to the number of agents who support a proposition, whereas rules based on the majoritarian judgment set did not distinguish between close and strong majorities. Formally, R is based on the weighted majoritarian judgment set if for any two profiles P and Q such that N(P, \u03d5) = N(Q,\u03d5) for all \u03d5 \u2208 A, we have R(P ) = R(Q). Since m(P ) can be recovered from N(P, .), any rule based on the majoritarian judgment set is also based on the weighted majoritarian judgment set.\nThe first rule of this class we consider is the maxweight sub-agenda rule.\n6 There it is defined in a different way, using quantitative intuitions: given two (A, \u0393 )- judgment sets J and J \u2032 and a profile P , and letting J \u2229 {\u03d5,\u00ac\u03d5} = {\u03d5J} and J\n\u2032 \u2229 {\u03d5,\u00ac\u03d5} = {\u03d5J\u2032}, they say that J is more representative than judgment set J\n\u2032 of P (denoted J P J\n\u2032) if for any \u03d5 \u2208 [A], it holds that N(\u03d5J , P ) \u2265 N(\u03d5J\u2032,P ) \u2014 in other terms, J receives at least as much support as J \u2032 on every issue. Then they define the Condorcet admissible set of profile P as the set of all (A, \u0393 )-judgment sets that are maximal with respect to P . 7 The original definition of Endpointd [17] was more general: it was introduced for an arbitrary distance d between judgment sets.\nDefinition 6 (Maxweight sub-agenda rule). The maxweight sub-agenda rule (mwa) is defined as follows: for every agenda A, for every \u0393 \u2208 L, for every (A, \u0393 )-profile P ,\nmwaA,\u0393 (P ) = argmax J\u2208D(A,\u0393 )\nWP (J) where WP (J) = \u2211\n\u03d5\u2208J\nN(P, \u03d5).\nThe mwa rule appears in many places under different names: \u201cPrototype\u201d [17], \u201cmedian rule\u201d [19] and \u201csimple scoring rule\u201d [4]. It also appears under a different, but equivalent formulation, under the name \u201cdistance-based procedure\u201d [10,17]. Variants of this rule were defined by Pigozzi [21] and before that by Konieczny and Pino-Pe\u0301rez [12]. For completeness we give here this equivalent distance-based formulation. Given the Hamming distance dH between two judgment sets, the distance-based rule F dH ,\u03a3 is defined as follows: for every agenda A, for every \u0393 \u2208 L, for every (A, \u0393 )-profile P ,\nF dH ,\u03a3A,\u0393 (P ) = argmin J\u2208D(A,\u0393 )\n\u2211\nJi\u2208P\ndH(Ji, J).\nWe show that F dH ,\u03a3 coincides with mwa.

J \u2208 mwaA,\u0393 (P ) if and only if J maximises WP (J); i.e. if and only if J minimises |J | \u00b7 n\u2212WP (J)\nSince \u2211\nJi\u2208P dH(J, Ji) = |J | \u00b7 n\u2212WP (J), we conclude that J \u2208 F dH ,\u03a3 A,\u0393 (P ) if\nand only if J \u2208 mwaA,\u0393 (P ).\nExample 6. Consider the agenda and profile of Example 3. We obtain:\nN(P, p \u2227 r) = 10, N(P,\u00ac(p \u2227 r)) = 7 N(P, p \u2227 s) = 10, N(P,\u00ac(p \u2227 s)) = 7 N(P, q) = 13, N(P,\u00acq) = 4 N(P, p \u2227 q) = 6, N(P,\u00ac(p \u2227 q)) = 11 N(P, t) = 10, N(P,\u00act) = 7\nmwaA,\u22a4(P ) = {{p\u2227 r, p \u2227 s, q, p \u2227 q, t}}, due to the fact that WP ({p \u2227 r, p \u2227 s, q, p \u2227 q, t}) = 49 is maximal with respect to all J \u2208 D(A, \u0393 ).\nProposition 2. mwa is majority-preserving.\nProof. Let A be an agenda, \u0393 \u2208 L and P an n-voter majority-consistent (A, \u0393 )- profile, We claim thatmwaA,\u0393 (P ) = CompA,\u0393 (m(P )). Note that J \u2208 mwaA,\u0393 (P ) if and only if J is a judgment set maximising \u2211\n\u03d5\u2208J N(P, \u03d5). Let B = {\u03d5 \u2208 [A] | \u03d5 /\u2208 m(P ) and \u00ac\u03d5 /\u2208 m(P )} and B\u2032 = B \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2208 B}. For every \u03d5 \u2208 B\u2032, we have N(P, \u03d5) = n2 . Thus, whether \u03d5 or \u03d5 is in J is irrelevant for the score \u2211\n\u03d5\u2208J N(P, \u03d5). On the contrary, for every \u03d5 \u2208 A \\ B \u2032, in order to\nmaximise \u2211\n\u03d5\u2208J N(P, \u03d5), J must contain \u03d5 if and only if \u03d5 \u2208 m(P ). Hence, J \u2208 mwaA,\u0393 (P ) if and only if J \u2208 CompA,\u0393 (m(P )).\nThe following rule is inspired from the ranked pairs rules in voting theory [23]. It consists in first fixing the truth value for the elements of the agenda with the largest majority. It proceeds by considering the elements \u03d5 of the agenda in non-increasing order of N(P, \u03d5) and fixing each agenda issue value to the majoritarian value if it does not lead to an inconsistency.\nDefinition 7 (Ranked agenda). Let A = {\u03c8, . . . , \u03c82m} be an agenda, \u0393 \u2208 L and let P be a (A, \u0393 )-profile. Let %P be the weak order on A defined by: for all \u03c8, \u03c8\u2032 \u2208 A, \u03c8 %P \u03c8\u2032 iff N(P, \u03c8) \u2265 N(P, \u03c8\u2032). For a permutation \u03c3 of {1, . . . , 2m}, let >\u03c3 be the linear order on A defined by \u03c8\u03c3(1) >\u03c3 . . . >\u03c3 \u03c8\u03c3(2m). We say that >\u03c3 is compatible with %P if \u03c8\u03c3(1) %P \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 %P \u03c8\u03c3(2m). The ranked agenda rule is defined as follows: J \u2208 raA,\u0393 (P ) if and only if there exists a permutation \u03c3 such that >\u03c3 is compatible with %P and such that J = J\u03c3 is obtained by the following procedure:\nS := \u2205; for j = 1, . . . , 2m do if S \u222a {\u03c8\u03c3(j)} is \u0393 -consistent, then S := S \u222a {\u03c8\u03c3(j)} end for; J\u03c3 := S.\nNote that ra is based on the weighted majoritarian judgment set.\nExample 7. Consider the profile of Example 3. We have q \u227bP \u00ac(p \u2227 q) \u227bP p \u2227 r \u223cP p \u2227 s \u223cP t \u227bP \u00ac(p \u2227 r) \u223cP \u00ac(p \u2227 s) \u223cP \u00act \u227bP p\u2227 q \u227bP \u00acq (where \u223cP and \u227bP are respectively the indifference and the strict preference relations induced from %P ). We obtain\nraA,\u22a4(P ) = {{q,\u00ac(p \u2227 q), t,\u00ac(p \u2227 r),\u00ac(p \u2227 s)}}.\nNote that ra is well-defined in the sense that it outputs a set of (complete) judgment sets.\nProposition 3. ra is majority-preserving.\nProof. Let P be a majority-consistent profile based on A and \u0393 . We first show that raA,\u0393 (P ) \u2286 CompA,\u0393 (P ). Let >\u03c3 be a linear order on A induced by permutation \u03c3 and compatible with %P . Observe that in >\u03c3, the elements of m(P ) are considered before the elements of A \\ m(P ). Therefore, when an element \u03d5 of m(P ) is considered, the current judgment set S is a subset of m(P ) and S \u222a {\u03d5} \u2286 m(P ), therefore S \u222a {\u03d5} is consistent, which implies that \u03d5 is incorporated into S. Since this is true for every \u03d5 \u2208 A, we get that every element of raA,\u0393 (P ) contains m(P ).\nLet us now show that CompA,\u0393 (P ) \u2286 raA,\u0393 (P ). Let J \u2208 CompA,\u0393 (m(P )). Take >\u03c3 such that all elements of m(P ) are considered first, then all elements of J \\m(P ), and then all elements of A \\ J . This order is compatible with %P , because if \u03d5 \u2208 m(P ) then N(P, \u03d5) > n2 , if \u03d5 \u2208 J \\m(P ) then N(P, \u03d5) = n 2 and if \u03d5 \u2208 A \\ J then N(P, \u03d5) \u2264 n2 . Lastly, J\u03c3 = J , which proves that J \u2208 raA,\u0393 (P ).\nThe ra rule is new, but presents some similarity of the leximax rule in [18], which is in fact is a refinement of ra8 and which has been studied independently in [11]."}, {"heading": "3.3 Rules based on the removal or change of individual judgments", "text": "The last family of rules we consider contains rules that are constructed around the principle of minimally changing the aggregated profile. The difference between the original and changed profile is expressed in terms of some distance. Different rules will be obtained with different distance functions. This family of judgment aggregation rules can be viewed as the judgment aggregation counterpart of voting rules that are based on performing minimal operations on profiles with the purpose of obtaining a profile for which a Condorcet winner exists. In [9] these rules are said to be rationalizable by some distance with respect to the Condorcet consensus class.)\nThe first rule we consider is called the Young rule for judgment aggregation, by analogy with the Young rule in voting, which outputs the candidate x minimising the number of voters to remove from the profile so that x becomes a Condorcet winner.\nDefinition 8 (Young rule). Let A be an agenda, \u0393 \u2208 L and P an n-voter A, \u0393 -profile. We define set MSP (P ) as follows: PI \u2208MSP if and only if\n8 Here is a profile P for which ra and leximax differ:\np \u2227 q p q p \u2227 r q \u2227 r s 5\u00d7 \u2212 + \u2212 + \u2212 + 5\u00d7 \u2212 \u2212 + \u2212 + \u2212 4\u00d7 + + + + + + 1\u00d7 + + + \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\nra(P ) = {{p \u2227 q, p, q, p \u2227 r, q \u2227 r, s}, {\u00ac(p \u2227 q), p,\u00acq, p \u2227 r,\u00ac(q \u2227 r), s}, {\u00ac(p \u2227 q),\u00acp, q,\u00ac(p \u2227 r), q \u2227 r, s}} and leximax(P ) = {{p \u2227 q, p, q, p \u2227 r, q \u2227 r, s}}.\n1. PI is a k-voter sub-profile of P 2. PI is majority-consistent 3. there exists no PI\u2032 such that PI\u2032 is a j-voter majority-consistent sub-profile\nof P and j > k\nThe Young judgment aggregation rule is defined as\nyA,\u0393 (P ) = Comp({m(PI) | PI \u2208MSP (P )}).\nIntuitively, this rule consists of removing a minimal number of agents so that the profile becomes majority-consistent. Or, equivalently, we maximize the number of voters we keep of a given profile. If the profile P is majority-consistent, then no voter needs to be removed and yA,\u0393 (P ) = CompA,\u0393 (m(P )), hence y is majority-preserving.\nExample 8. Once again we considerA and P from Example 3. We obtain yA,\u22a4(P ) = CompA,\u0393 ({q,\u00ac(p \u2227 q)}) =\n{\n{\u00ac(p \u2227 r), \u00ac(p \u2227 s), q, \u00ac(p \u2227 q), t}, {\u00ac(p \u2227 r), \u00ac(p \u2227 s), q, \u00ac(p \u2227 q), \u00act}\n}\n.\nThis result is obtained by removing 3 copies of J1 or (2 copies of J1 and one copy of J2) or (one copy of J1 and 2 copies of J2) or 3 copies of J2. Removing less judgment sets, or other 3 judgment sets, does not lead to a majority-consistent profile.\nThe last rule we define does not remove agenda elements and/or voters, but looks for a minimal number of atomic changes in the profile so that P becomes majority-consistent. We consider an atomic change to be the change of truth value of one element of the agenda in an individual judgment set. For instance, if J1 = {p, q, p \u2227 q, r, p \u2227 r}, then J \u20321 = {\u00acp, q, \u00ac(p \u2227 q), r,\u00ac(p \u2227 r)} is obtained from J1 by a series of three atomic changes (change in the truth value of p, of p \u2227 q and of p \u2227 r).\nReplacing having a Condorcet winner by being majority-consistent and adapting the notion of elementary change, we get our judgment aggregation rule that corresponds to the fulld rule by Miller and Osherson [17] for the choice of the Hamming distance.\nDefinition 9 (Minimal atomic change rule). Let A be an agenda, \u0393 \u2208 L and let P = {J1, ..., Jn} and Q = {J \u20321, ..., J \u2032 n} be two n-voter (A, \u0393 )-profiles. We define:\nDH(P,Q) =\nn \u2211\ni=1\ndH(Ji, J \u2032 i).\nThe minimal atomic change rule is defined as:\nmnacA,\u0393 (P ) = CompA,\u0393 ({m(Q) | Q \u2208 argmin Q\u2032\u2208Dn(A,\u0393 )\nDH(P,Q \u2032)}).\nExample 9. Consider the same agenda A and profile P from Example 3 and let \u0393 = \u22a4. Profile Q given in Table 3 is the closest majority-consistent profile to P with DH(P,Q) = 3. We obtain mnacA,\u0393A,\u22a4(P ) = {{p \u2227 r, p \u2227 s, q, p \u2227 q, t}}.\nIf P is majority-consistent then no elementary change is needed, therefore mnac is majority-preserving.\nWe now establish the (non)inclusion relationships between the rules.\nProposition 4. The inclusion and incomparability relations among the rules we introduced are as in Table 4: if F is the column rule and F \u2032 is the row rule, then\n\u2013 F \u2286 F \u2032 means that for every agenda A, for every \u0393 \u2208 L, for every (A, \u0393 )- profile P , we have FA,\u0393 (P ) \u2286 FA,\u0393 (P ). \u2013 F inc F \u2032 means that neither F \u2286 F \u2032 nor F \u2032 \u2286 F \u2013 F \u2282 F \u2032 means that F \u2286 F \u2032 and F 6= F \u2032\nThe proof of this proposition can be found in Appendix."}, {"heading": "3.4 A note on rules that are not majority-preserving", "text": "The Duddy-Piggins judgment aggregation rule [8] is defined as follows: the geodesic graph GA associated with agenda A is the graph whose vertices are the consistent judgment sets over A, and containing edge (J, J \u2032) for all consistent J, J \u2032 such that there is no J\u201d such that J\u2206J\u201d \u2286 J\u2206J \u2032 (where \u2206 denotes symmetric difference). The geodesic distance dg between consistent judgment\nsets is defined as the length of the shortest path in GA. The distance D(J, P \u2217) between a consistent judgment set J\u2217 and a profile P is \u03a3J\u2208Pdg(J \u2217, J). Finally, FDP (P ) = argminJ\u2208D(A,\u0393 )D(J, P ). Note that the distance proposed by Duddy and Piggins [8] is also known as the geodesic metric [3, p.104].\nProposition 5. FDP is not majority-consistent.\nProof. Let P be the profile on Table 5.\nThere are eight judgment sets over A. Denote D(A,\u22a4) = {J1, . . . , J8}. We can verify that for every Ji, Jj \u2208 D(A,\u22a4), if Ji 6= Jj then the geodesic distance between Ji and Jj is 1. Therefore, dg(J2, P ) = 8. Note that for all Ji \u2208 {J1, J3, J4, J5}, dg(Ji, P ) = 9. Also, for all Ji \u2208 {J6, J7, J8}, dg(Ji, P ) = 11. Therefore, FDP (P ) = {J2} whereas P is majority-consistent and m(P ) = {J1}.\nDietrich [4] defines a general class of scoring rules for judgment aggregation. Given a function s : A\u00d7D(A,\u22a4) \u2192 R, the rule SRs is defined as\nSRs(P ) = argmax J\u2208D(A,\u22a4)\n\u2211\n\u03d5\u2208J\nn \u2211\ni=1\ns(Ji, \u03d5)\nFive scoring functions are defined by Dietrich [4]: reversal scoring, entailment scoring, disjoint entailment scoring, minimal entailment scoring and irreducible entailment scoring. Each scoring function gives rise to a judgment aggregation rule and we can show, using counter examples, that none of these rules is majority-preserving.\nReversal scoring rev is defined as rev(J, \u03d5) = minJ\u2032\u2208D(A,\u22a4), \u03d5/\u2208J\u2032 dH(J, J \u2032).\nProposition 6. The rule SRrev is not majority-preserving.\nProof. Consider the preagenda [A] = {p, \u03b1, q}, where \u03b1 \u2261 (p\u2228r)\u2227(r\u2228q)\u2227(p\u2228q) and \u0393 = \u22a4. The scores according to each of the judgment sets in D(A,\u22a4) are given in Table 6\nThe profile P given in Table 7 is majority-consistent, with m(P ) = {p, \u03b1, q}. However, SRrev(P ) = {{\u00acp, \u03b1, q}}.\nEntailment scoring ent, is defined as ent(J, \u03d5) = |{S \u2286 J | S entails \u03d5}|.\nProposition 7. SRent is not majority-preserving.\nProof. We consider again the same agenda as in the proof of Proposition 6. Table 8 gives the entailment scores for each judgment according to each of the judgment sets in D(A,\u22a4).\nThe entailment scoring rule is not majority-preserving. Consider the profile in Table 9. The profile is majority-consistent and m(P ) = {p, \u03b1, q}, however the entailment scoring rule selects the judgment set {\u00acp, \u03b1, q}.\nThe disjoint entailment scoring dis, minimal entailment scoring mie and irreducible entailment scoring irr9 are defined as follows.The function dis(J, \u03d5) is the number of pairwise disjoint judgment subsets of J entailing \u03d5. The function mie(J, \u03d5) is defined as the number of judgment subsets of J which minimally entail \u03d5. Lastly, irr(J, \u03d5) is defined as the number of judgment subsets of J which irreducibly entail \u03d5. More detailed explanations for each of these functions can be found in the original paper [4, p.15-17].\nProposition 8. SRdis, SRmie and SRirr are not majority-preserving.\nProof. The same counter example suffices for all three rules. Consider the same agenda and profile as in the proof of Proposition 7.

The disjoint entailment, minimal entailment and irreducible entailment scoring rules all select as collective the judgment set {\u00acp, \u03b1, q}."}, {"heading": "4 From Judgment Aggregation to Voting Rules", "text": "Since preference aggregation can be recast as a specific case of judgment aggregation using the preference agenda [5], it is natural to expect that judgment aggregation rules can generalise voting rules. In this section we first define what it means for a judgment aggregation rule to generalise a voting rule and then we show that several well-known voting rules are recovered as particular cases of our judgment aggregation rules.\nIn this section, we assume that judgment profiles contain an odd number of individual judgments. The reason for this assumption is that this assumption makes the connections to voting rules more natural and easier to state.\nLet C = {x1, . . . , xq} be a set of alternatives. L(C) is the set of all strict linear orders (that is, transitive, asymmetric and connected relations) on C. For \u227b\u2208 L(C) we denote the (singleton) set containing the best element with respect to \u227b as top( ) = {c \u2208 C | \u2200c\u2032 \u2208 C, c \u227b c\u2032}.\nAn n-voter profile over C is a collection V = \u3008\u227b1, . . . ,\u227bn\u3009 of strict linear orders over C. An irresolute voting rule (or voting correspondence) is a function R mapping every n-voter profile for arbitrary large n into a nonempty set of alternatives R(V ) \u2208 2C \\ {\u2205}. For every pair of alternatives (x, y) \u2208 C and profile V , let nV (x, y) be the number of votes in V ranking x above y, and let M(V ) be the majority graph associated with V , whose vertices are C and containing edge (x, y) iff nV (x, y) > n 2 . x \u2208 C is a weak Condorcet winner for V if there is no ingoing edge to x in M(V ) . The Top-cycle (TC) rule maps every profile V to the set of alternatives x \u2208 C such that for all y \u2208 C \\ {x}, there exists a path in M(V ) that goes from x to y. Equivalently, TC(P ) is the smallest set S such that for every x \u2208 S and y \u2208 C \\ S, we have (x, y) \u2208M(V ).\nA Slater order for V is a strict linear order \u227b over C maximising the number of (x, y) such that x \u227b y iff (x, y)\u2208M(V ). The Slater rule maps a profile V to the set of all alternatives that are dominating in some Slater order for M(V ).\nThe Copeland rule maps V to the set of alternatives maximising the number nc(x) of outgoing edges from x in M(V ).\nThe ranked pairs rule [24] is defined as follows. We define first its non-neutral version: given a tie-breaking priority, that is, a strict linear order \u03c1 over {(x, y) \u2208 C2, x 6= y}, the strict linear order >\u03c1 on {(x, y) \u2208 C\n2, x 6= y} is constructed as follows: (x, y) >\u03c1 (x \u2032, y\u2032) iff either (a) nV (x, y) > nV (x \u2032, y\u2032) or (b) if nV (x, y) = nV (x \u2032, y\u2032) and \u03c1 gives priority to (x, y) over (x\u2032, y\u2032). Then all pairs (x, y) are considered in sequence according to >\u03c1, and we build a strict linear order \u227b\u03c1 over C starting with the pair on top of >\u03c1, and iteratively adding the current pair to \u227b\u03c1 if it does not make it cyclic. The ranked pairs winner for V according to \u03c1 is the unique undominated element in \u227b\u03c1. Now, x is a winner of the neutral ranked pairs rule for V iff it is a winner of the non-neutral ranked pairs rule for some \u03c1. (See the recent work by Brill and Fischer [2] for a discussion on neutral and non-neutral variants of ranked pairs.)\nThe maximin rule maps V to the set of alternatives that maximise mm(x, V ) = miny\u2208C\\{x} nV (x, y).\nLet SY (x, V ) be the minimal number of votes whose removal from V makes x a weak Condorcet winner. If it is not possible to make x a weak Condorcet winner by removing elements of V , we define SY (x, V ) = +\u221e. The Young (voting) rule maps V to the set of alternatives that minimise SY (x, V ).\nThe Kemeny distance \u03b4K between \u227bi\u2208 L(C) and \u227bj\u2208 L(C) is the number of pairs x, y \u2208 C such that x \u227bi y and y \u227bj x. The Kemeny rule is defined as\nKemeny(V ) =\n{\ntop(\u227b)| \u227b\u2208 argmin\u227b\u2208L(C)\nn \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b4K(\u227b,\u227bi)\n}\nA specific type of agenda is the preference agenda associated with a set of alternatives C. The propositions of preference agenda are of the form xPy (\u201cx preferred to y\u201d) [6].\nDefinition 10. The preference pre-agenda associated with C = {x1, . . . , xq} is [A]C = {xiPxj | 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 q}. The corresponding agenda is the set AC = [A]C \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2208 [A]C}.\nWhen j > i, xjPxi is not a proposition of AC , but we will write xjPxi as a shorthand for \u00ac(xiPxj).\nDefinition 11. Let C be a set of alternatives and \u227b\u2286 C\u00d7C. To \u227b we associate the set J(\u227b), defined as follows:\nJ(\u227b) = {xPy | x \u227b y, for x, y \u2208 C}.\nLet V = \u3008\u227b1, ...,\u227bn\u3009 be an n-voter profile over C. The judgment aggregation profile associated with V is\nP (V ) = \u3008J(\u227b1), . . . , J(\u227bn)\u3009.\nConversely, given a set J \u2286 AC , the binary relation \u227bJ over C is defined by: for all xi, xj \u2208 C, xi \u227bJ xj if and only if xiPxj \u2208 J .\nNow we define two preference constraints: the transitivity constraint Tr and the dominating alternative, or \u201cwinner\u201d, constraint W . Note that they both depend on C. However, we do not write Tr(C) nor W (C) when there is no danger of confusion.\nDefinition 12. Let C be a set of alternatives and AC the associated preference agenda, with |AC | = m = q(q+1)\n2 . We define the transitivity Tr and dominating alternative W constraints:\n\u2013 Tr = \u2227\ni,j,k\u2208{1,...,m}\n( (xiPxj) \u2227 (xjPxk) \u2192 (xiPxk) )\n\u2013 W = \u2228\ni\u2208{1,...,m}\n\u2227\nj 6=i(xiPxj)\nNote that any complete Tr-consistent judgment set is alsoW -consistent, that is, Tr is stronger than W when applied to complete judgment sets.\nLemma 1. Let \u227b be a binary relation over AC .\n\u2013 J(\u227b) is Tr-consistent if and only if \u227b is acyclic; \u2013 J(\u227b) is W -consistent if and only if \u227b has at least one undominated element.\nProof. J is Tr-consistent iff \u227bJ can be completed into a transitive order, i.e., iff \u227bJ is acyclic; J is W -consistent iff some x can be made a winner by adding the missing propositions xPy, which is possible iff some x is undominated in \u227bJ .\nAs a consequence of Lemma 1, any Tr-consistent subset of AC is also W - consistent. Note also that \u227bJ is a strict linear order on C if and only if J is a judgment set based on AC and Tr.\nFor instance, let J = {aPb, aPc, bPc, dPb, cPe, ePb}; then\n\u227bJ= {(a, b), (a, c), (b, c), (d, b), (c, e), (e, b)}\nJ is not Tr-consistent because \u227bJ contains the cycle b \u227bJ c \u227bJ e \u227bJ b. However, it is W -consistent: a and d are both undominated in \u227bJ .\nFor each x \u2208 C we defineW (x) = \u2227\ny\u2208C,y 6=x(xPy). Note thatW is equivalent to \u2228\nx\u2208C W (x) and that J is W (x)-consistent iff x is undominated in \u227bJ . Since each vote \u227bi is a strict linear order, the judgment aggregation profile associated with V is well-defined, i.e. every J(\u227bi) is complete and Tr-consistent. The collective judgment will sometimes be required to be consistent with respect to Tr and sometimes only to be consistent with respect to W . Lemma 2 is straightforward from Definition 11.\nLemma 2. Given a voting profile V , for all x, y \u2208 C, xPy is in m(P (V )) iff (x, y) \u2208M(V ).\nProposition 9. A voting profile V has a Condorcet winner iff m(P (V )) is W - consistent.\nProof. From Lemma 2, xPy is in m(P (V )) iff M(V ) contains (x, y). Since n is odd, m(P (V )) contains either xiPxj or xjPxi for all i 6= j, therefore m(P (V ))\u222a {W} 2 \u22a5 iff there exists x \u2208 C such that m(P (V )) contains {xPy | y 6= x}, that is, by Lemma 2 again, iff V has a Condorcet winner10.\nDefinition 13. Let C be a set of alternatives, AC the associated preference agenda and let \u0393 \u2208 {Tr(C),W (C)}. For judgment set J \u2208 D(AC , \u0393 ), let\nWin(J) = {x \u2208 C | for every y \u2208 C, xPy \u2208 J}.\nLet \u0393 \u2208 {Tr,W} and F be a judgment aggregation rule. The voting rule FF,\u0393 induced from F and \u0393 is defined as x \u2208 FF,\u0393 (P (V )) if there is a J \u2208 FF,\u0393 (P (V )) such that x \u2208 Win(J), or equivalently:\nRF,\u0393 (P ) = \u22c3\nJ\u2208F\u0393 (P (V ))\nWin(J).\nNote that for any W -consistent, and a fortiori for any Tr-consistent J we have Win(J) 6= \u2205, therefore Definition 13 is well-founded.\nThus, for every judgment aggregation rule F we have two voting rules, obtained by requiring the collective judgment set to be acyclic, i.e., consistent with Tr, or to have a undominated element, i.e., consistent with W .\nExample 10. Let\nV = \u3008a \u227b1 b \u227b1 c \u227b1 d, b \u227b2 c \u227b2 a \u227b1 d, d \u227b3 c \u227b3 a \u227b3 b\u3009\nWe have P (V ) = \u3008J1, J2, J3\u3009 with J1 = {aPb, aPc, aPd, bPc, bPd, cPd}, J2 = {bPa, bPc, bPd, cPa, cPd, aPd} and J3 = {dPa, dPb, dPc, cPa, cPb, aPb}; and we have m(P (V )) = {aPb, bPc, cPa, aPd, bPd, cPd}.\nLet us choose F = MSA and \u0393 = Tr. We have FTr(P (V )) = {J, J \u2032, J \u2032\u2032}, where J = {aPb, aPc, aPd, bPc, bPd, cPd}, J \u2032 = {aPb, cPa, aPd, cPb, bPd, cPd} and J \u2032\u2032 = {bPa, cPa, aPd, bPc, bPd, cPd}. Now, Win(J) = {a}, Win(J \u2032) = {c} and Win(J \u2032\u2032) = {b}. Therefore, FMSA,Tr(P (V )) = {a, b, c}.\nProposition 10.\n1. RMSA,Tr = TopCycle 11\n2. RMSA,W =\n{\n{c} if V has a Condorcet winner c C otherwise\n10 Note that for an even n, W -consistency would be equivalent to the existence of a weak Condorcet winner. 11 This result has been independently proven \u2013 although stated in a very different way \u2013 in [19]: point (a) of their Proposition 3.1 states that J \u2208 MSA(P (V )) if \u227bJ is a directed Hamiltonian chain; this implies RMSA,Tr = TopCycle.\nProof. We prove the first correspondence. From Lemmas 1 and 2, J is a maximal Tr-consistent subset of m(P ) iff \u227bJ is a maximal acyclic sub-graph of M(V ). Let x \u2208 TC(V ); then there exists an acyclic subrelation G of M(V ) containing, for all y 6= x, a path from x to y. G can be completed into a maximal acyclic subrelation G\u2032 of M(V ), and x is undominated in G\u2032 (because adding an edge to any y 6= x would create a cycle), therefore G\u2032 corresponds to a maximal Tr-consistent subset J of m(P (V )), consistent with W (x), which means that x \u2208 FRMSA,Tr(V ). Conversely, if there is a J \u2208 msaAC ,Tr(V ) such that x \u2208 Win(J), then there exists a maximal Tr-consistent subset J \u2032 of AC such that J is a completion of J \u2032 and \u227bJ\u2032 is a maximal acyclic subrelation of M(V ) in which x does not have any incoming edge. Assume x /\u2208 TC(V ); then there is an y such that there is no path from x to y in M(V ). Obviously, (x, y) 6\u2208 M(V ), therefore, sinceM(V ) is complete, (y, x) \u2208M(V ). Adding (y, x) to \u227bJ results in an acyclic subrelation ofM(V ) that contains \u227bJ , therefore \u227bJ is not a maximal acyclic subset of M(V ), contradiction.\nNow we prove the second correspondence. Assume there is no Condorcet winner. Let x \u2208 C. Let S(x) be the subset of m(P (V )) defined by {yPz|z 6= x, yPz \u2208 m(P (V ))}. S(x) is W -consistent, because it is consistent with W (x). Let us now prove that S(x) is a maximal W -consistent subset of m(P (V )). By means of contradiction, assume that S(x) is not a maximal subset of m(P (V )): then there is some element of m(P (V )) \\ S(x) that can be added to S(x) without violating W -consistency; now, every element of m(P (V ))\\S(x) is of the form yPx. Let S\u2032 = S(x) \u222a {yPx}. S\u2032 is not consistent with W (x). Therefore, since it is W -consistent, it must be consistent with W (z) for some z 6= x. This implies that there is no tPz \u2208 S\u2032, therefore, no tPz \u2208 S(x). Now, by construction of S(x), this means that there is no tPz \u2208 m(P (V )), which implies that z is a Condorcet winner: contradiction. Thus, it must be that S(x) is a maximal W -consistent subset of m(P (V )). Note also that there is a unique W -consistent completion J of S(x). Furthermore, Win(J) = {x}.\nProposition 11.\n1. RMCSA,Tr = Slater 2. RMCSA,W = Copeland\nProof. For point 1, let J \u2208MCSATr(P (V )), hence J \u2208 max(m(P ), T r, |.|) and \u227bJ is an acyclic subrelation of M(V ). Let > be a linear order extending \u227bJ . The number of edge reversals needed to obtain > from \u227bJ is |m(P (V )) \\ J |. This number is minimal iff J has a maximal cardinality. Consequently, > is a Slater order for V . Conversely, let > be a Slater order for V and let J = {xPy | x > y and xPy \u2208 m(P (V ))}. Because > is a linear order, J is Tr-consistent. Moreover, |m(P (V )) \\ J | is the number of edge reversals needed to obtain > from M(V ). Since |m(P (V )) \\ J | is minimal, |J | is maximal and therefore J \u2208 MCSATr(P (V )). This one-to-one correspondence between Slater orders for V and maxcard acyclic subgraphs of P (V ) allows us to conclude.\nFor point 2, let J \u2208 max(m(P ),W, |.|). From J \u222a {W} 2 \u22a5 it follows that there exists a x \u2208 C such that for every y \u2208 C, yPx 6\u2208 J . For every y \u2208 C,\nconsider z \u2208 C, z 6= x, such that yPz \u2208 m(P (V )). Adding yPz to J results in a judgment set which is still W -consistent, therefore the maximum W -consistent subsets ofm(P (V )) are of the form Jx = m(P (V ))\\{yPx, y 6= x} for some x \u2208 C, and such a judgment set Jx is a maxcard W -consistent subset of m(P (V )) iff |{y | xPy \u2208 m(P (V ))}| is maximal, i.e., using Lemma 2, iff x \u2208 Copeland(V ).\nExample 11. Let V be such that M(V ) = {(a,b),(a,c),(b,c),(b,d),(c,d),(d,a)}, i.e., m(P (V )) = {aPb, aPc, bPc, bPd, cPd, dPa}. The only maxcard Tr-consistent subset of m(P (V )) is J = {aPb, aPc, bPc, bPd, cPd}, and Win(J) = {a}; a is also the only Slater winner for P . Now, m(P (V )) has two maxcardW -consistent subsets: J and J \u2032 = {aPc, bPc, bPd, cPd, dPa};Win(J \u2032) = {b}; a and b are also the Copeland winners for V .\nProposition 12.\n1. RRA,Tr = ranked pairs. 2. RRA,W = maximin.\nProof. The proof of point (1) is simple, due to the ty of the definitions of ranked pairs and ra, and observing that adding xPy to a current Tr-consistent judgment set without violating Tr corresponds to adding (x, y) to a current acyclic graph without creating a cycle. The proof of point (2) is more interesting. The candidate x is a maximin winner if it maximizes mm(x, V ), or equivalently, if it minimises maxy nV (y, x). Let \u03b2 = minx maxy nV (y, x). (Note that we have \u03b2 > n2 when there is no Condorcet winner.) Assume that x is a Maximin winner for V . In order to show that x \u2208 raAC ,W (P (V )), we have to construct a strict linear order \u227b=\u227b\u03c3 on {xPy | (x, y) \u2208 C2, x 6= y}, compatible with %P (V ), such that the judgment set J\u03c3 obtained by following \u227b\u03c3 is such that x \u2208 Win(J\u03c3). Let \u227b\u03c3 be as follows:\n1. the first propositions of \u227b\u03c3 are all uPv such that nV (u, v) > \u03b2, with ties broken in an arbitrary manner; 2. the propositions that follow in \u227b\u03c3 are all yPz such that nV (y, z) = \u03b2 and z 6= x; 3. the following propositions are all yPx such that nV (y, x) = \u03b2; 4. the rest of \u227b\u03c3 does not matter.\nWe now follow step by step the construction of J\u03c3. During step (1) \u2013 corresponding to considering one by one the propositions in (1) above \u2013 we consider all the propositions uPv such that nV (u, v) > \u03b2, and all are added to S, because the resulting judgment set is consistent with W (x), and a fortiori with W (otherwise it would be the case that for all y, nV (y, x) > \u03b2, contradicting minx maxy nV (y, x) = \u03b2). During step (2) all propositions yPz such that nV (y, z) = \u03b2 and z 6= x are considered one by one, and they are all added to S, because the resulting judgment set is, each time, consistent with W (x) and a fortiori with W . After steps (1) and (2), due to the fact that\n\u03b2 = minx maxy nV (y, x), S contains some yPz for all z 6= x. Step (3) considers all yPx such that nV (y, x) = \u03b2, and does not add them to S, because this would make it inconsistent with W . Finally, the propositions considered in Step (4) are not of the form yPx. Therefore, x \u2208 Win(J\u03c3) and x \u2208 raAC ,W (P (V )).\nConversely, let x \u2208 raAC ,W (P (V )). Let > be the order refining %P (V ) such that the judgment set obtained is J , with x \u2208 Win(J). First, all formulas uPv such thatN(P, uPv) > \u03b2 are added to S without creating any inconsistency with W . Then, > must consider all propositions zPy such that N(P (V ), zPy) = \u03b2 and y 6= x, and add them all to S; at this point, for any y 6= x, a proposition zPy has been considered and added to S, otherwise there would be an y such that for no z it holds that nV (z, y) \u2265 \u03b2, which would contradict \u03b2 = minx maxy nV (y, x). Therefore, no propositions zPx will be added to S (or elseW would be violated). Therefore, x is such that minx maxy nV (y, x) \u2264 \u03b2, hence minx maxy nV (y, x) = \u03b2: x is a maximin winner.\nExample 12. Let n = 9 and V such that nV is as follows:\nnV a b c d a \u2212 6 2 4 b 3 \u2212 5 6 c 7 4 \u2212 2 d 5 3 7 \u2212\n(3)\nThe weak order %P (V ) starts with cPa and dPc (tied), then aPb and bPd, then bPc and dPa, etc. Applying raAC ,W starts by adding cPa and dPc, whatever the choice of the strict linear order \u227b\u03c3 refining %P . Next, there is a choice between aPb or bPd. If aPb is considered first (that is, if aPb \u227b\u03c3 bPd), then it is added to S, bPd is not (because it would violate W -consistency), and then all other propositions except aPd, bPd and cPd are added. The other choice is similar, replacing d by b. Therefore, raAC ,W (P (V )) contains the two judgment sets\nJ1 = {dPc, dPa, dPb, cPa, bPc, aPb}\nand\nJ2 = {bPa, bPc, bPd, dPa, dPc, cPa}\nwith Win(J1) = {d} and Win(J2) = {b}. We check that b and d are also the maximin winners for V .\nFor mwa, the similarity between the distance-based procedure (equivalent to the mwa rule, as shown in Section 3) and the Kemeny rule has been exploited [10] to obtain a characterisation of the complexity of the winner determination problem in judgment aggregation under the distance-based procedure.\nProposition 13. RMWA,Tr = Kemeny.\nProof. Let V = \u3008\u227b1, . . . ,\u227bn\u3009 be an n-voter profile over C and J a judgment set based on AC and Tr. Since J is complete and Tr-consistent, there is a ranking\n\u227b over C such that J = J(\u227b). Now, WP (V )(J) = \u2211\nxPy\u2208J(\u227b)N(P (V ), xPy) = \u2211\nx,y\u2208C|x\u227by nV (x, y) = n\u00b7q(q\u22121) 2 \u2212 \u2211n i=1 \u03b4K(\u227b,\u227bi).\nLet J \u2208 mwaAC ,Tr(P (V )). Then J is complete and Tr-consistent, therefore\nJ = J(\u227b) for some \u227b, and WP (V )(J) = n\u00b7q(q\u22121) 2 \u2212 \u2211n\ni=1 \u03b4K(\u227b,\u227bi). By means of contradiction, assume \u227b is not a Kemeny consensus for V ; then there is a \u227b\u2032 such that\n\u2211n i=1 \u03b4K(\u227b \u2032,\u227bi) < \u2211n i=1 \u03b4K(\u227b,\u227bi) therefore a complete, Tr-consistent J \u2032\nsuch that WP (V )(J \u2032) > WP (V )(J), which contradicts the assumption that J \u2208 mwaAC ,Tr(P (V )). Conversely, if \u227b is a Kemeny consensus, then J(\u227b) is a Tr-consistent judgment set. By means of contradiction, assume J(\u227b) /\u2208 mwaAC ,Tr(P (V )); then there exists a complete, Tr-consistent J \u2032 such that WP (V )(J\n\u2032) > WP (V )(J); because J \u2032 is complete and Tr-consistent, J \u2032 = J(\u227b\u2032) for some\u227b\u2032, andWP (V )(J\n\u2032) = n\u00b7q(q\u22121)\n2 \u2212 \u2211n i=1 \u03b4K(\u227b \u2032,\u227bi). Therefore, we obtain that \u2211n i=1 \u03b4K(\u227b \u2032,\u227bi) < \u2211n\ni=1 \u03b4K(\u227b ,\u227bi), which contradicts the assumption that \u227b is a Kemeny consensus.\nWe have shown that J \u2208 mwaAC ,Tr(P (V )) if and only if J = J(\u227b) for some Kemeny consensus \u227b. Therefore, there exists J \u2208 mwaAC ,Tr(P (V )) such that Win(J) = {x} if and only if x \u2208 Kemeny(P ).\nThe choice of the W constraint leads to an unknown voting rule, for which, interestingly, the winners maximizes the sum of the Borda score and a second term. An example of winner determination for this rule, which shows that it differs from Borda, is given in [14].\nProposition 14. RY oung,W =WeakY oung.\nProof. Removing a minimal number of judgments from P (V ) so as to make it consistent is equivalent to removing a minimal number of votes from V so that the majority graph contains an undominated outcome, i.e., so that there exists a weak Condorcet winner.\nFY oung,Tr does not appear to be a known voting rule. It consists of the dominating candidates in maximum cardinality sub-profiles of P (V ) whose majoritarian aggregation is acyclic.\nTable 10 summarises our results.\nmsa mcsa ra mwa y\nTr Top Cycle Slater Ranked pairs Kemeny W Copeland Maximin Young\nTable 10: Correspondences between voting and judgment aggregation rules\nAlthough we focus in this paper on majority-preserving rules only, such correspondences can be worked out for other rules.

Hence, mnac does not satisfy weak (nor strong) unanimity.\nProposition 16. msa satisfies weak unanimity but not strong unanimity.\nProof. Let P be a profile based on agenda A and constraint \u0393 , and \u03d5 \u2208 A on which all agents give the same judgment \u03d5. There always exists a maximal consistent sub-agenda, with respect to set inclusion, that contains \u03d5. Consequently there exists a judgment set in msaA,\u0393 (P ) that contains \u03d5.\nAs a counter-example for msa satisfying strong unanimity, consider the profile P of Table 19. msa does not satisfy weak unanimity since there exists J \u2208 msaA,\u22a4(P ) such that \u00aca \u2208 J . Namely, {\u00aca,\u00ac(a \u2192 (b \u2228 c)),\u00acb,\u00acc,\u00ac(a \u2192 (d \u2228 e)),\u00acd,\u00ace} \u2208 msaA,\u22a4(P ) 12.\n12 MSA failing to satisfy strong unanimity is also a consequence of Theorem 2.2 in [20], which can be reformulated as: MSA satisfies strong unanimity if and only if A does not contain a minimal inconsistent subset of size 3 or more.\nProposition 17. ra and y satisfy strong (and weak) unanimity.\nProof.\n1. ra Let P be a profile and Y \u2286 A be the subset of the agenda consisting of all elements on which there is unanimity among the agents. Because individual judgment sets are consistent, the conjunction of all elements of Y is consistent. Now, when computing raA,\u0393 (P ), the elements of Y are considered first, and whatever the order in which they are considered, they are included in the resulting judgment set because no inconsistency arises. Therefore, for all \u03b1 \u2208 Y and all J \u2208 raA,\u0393 (P ), we have \u03b1 \u2208 J . 2. y Observe that if \u03b1 is unanimously accepted by all agents in the set N , it is consequently unanimously selected by all consistent subsets of N ."}, {"heading": "5.2 Monotonicity", "text": "In voting theory, the standard monotonicity property states that when the position of the winning alternative for a given profile improves in some vote, ceteris paribus, then it remains the winner.

For same reasons as in the previous case, we have that S\u2032 = S \u222a {\u03b1} is a maximal for cardinality \u0393 -consistent subset of m(P ).

Note that there is a unique judgment set J \u2032\u2032 \u2286 A such that J \u2032 \u2286 J \u2032\u2032. AlsoW (P, J \u2032\u2032) > W (P, J), since J \u2032\u2032\u2229m(P ) \u2283 J \u2229m(P ). Contradiction, thus J \u2032 is a maximal \u0393 -consistent subset ofm(P ). Consequently, J \u2208 msaA,\u0393 (P ). To show that msa 6\u2286 mwa, consider Example 3. 3. ra \u2282 msa. If J \u2208 raA,\u0393 (P ) then, by definition of ra, J \u2229 m(P ) is a maximal \u0393 - consistent subset of m(P ). Thus, J \u2208 msaA,\u0393 (P ). Example 3 shows that msa 6\u2286 ra. 4. mwa is incomparable with mcsa. To see that mcsa 6\u2286 mwa, consult Example 3. As for mwa 6\u2286 mcsa, consider the example from Table 19. We see that mcsaA,\u22a4 = {{\u00aca, a \u2192 (b \u2228\nc),\u00acb,\u00acc, a \u2192 (d \u2228 e),\u00acd,\u00ace}} and that {a, a \u2192 (b \u2228 c),\u00acb, c, a \u2192 (d \u2228 e),\u00acd, e} \u2208 mwaA,\u22a4.\nVoters {a,b, a \u2227 b}\n3\u00d7 +++ 2\u00d7 +- - 2\u00d7 - + -\nTable 18\n5. ra is incomparable with mcsa. Consider again the example from Table 19. mcsaA,\u22a4(P ) = { {\u00aca, a \u2192 (b \u2228 c),\u00acb,\u00acc, a \u2192 (d \u2228 e),\u00acd,\u00ace}} and for every J \u2208 raA,\u0393 (P ), a \u2208 J . Thus mcsa 6\u2286 ra and ra 6\u2286 mcsa. 6. y is incomparable with msa and mcsa. See Example 3. 7. mwa is incomparable with ra. See Example 3. 8. mwa is incomparable with y. See Example 3. 9. ra is incomparable with y. We know from Example 3 that y 6\u2286 ra. To see that ra 6\u2286 y, consider the example from Table 20.\nThe minimal number of agents to remove to make the profile majorityconsistent is two. These two agents are the two agents of the fourth row (light gray shaded). We see that yA,\u22a4(P ) = {{p, q, p \u2227 q, r, s, r \u2227 s, t}} and raA,\u22a4(P ) = {{p, q, p\u2227q, r, s, r\u2227s, t}, {p, q, p\u2227q, r, s, r\u2227s,\u00act}}. Thus, ra 6\u2286 y. 10. mnac is incomparable with mcsa. Example 3 shows that mcsa 6\u2286 mnac. Let us show that mnac 6\u2286 mcsa.\nConsider the profile P from Table 19. Recall that mcsaA,\u22a4(P ) = {{\u00aca, a\u2192 (b \u2228 c),\u00acb,\u00acc, a \u2192 (d \u2228 e),\u00acd,\u00ace}}. Considering mnac, note that there are no majority-consistent profiles at distance 1 from P . Let Q be the profile from Table 21.\nQ is majority-consistent and DH(P,Q) = 2. Thus, {a, a\u2192 (b\u2228 c),\u00acb, c, a \u2192 (d \u2228 e),\u00acd, e} \u2208 mnacA,\u22a4(P ). Therefore, mnac 6\u2286 mcsa. 11. mnac is incomparable with msa Consider the pre-agenda [A] = {p, q, p \u2227 q, p \u2227 \u00acq, \u03b11, \u03b12, q \u2227 \u00acp, \u03b13, \u03b14}, where \u03b11 = p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 \u00acq, \u03b12 = p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 \u00acq, \u03b13 = q \u2227 \u00acp \u2227 \u00acp, \u03b14 = q \u2227 \u00acp \u2227 \u00acp \u2227 \u00acp. Let P be the profile from Table 22. We obtain\nmsaA,\u22a4(P ) = {{p, q, p \u2227 q,\u00ac(p \u2227 \u00acq),\u00ac\u03b11,\u00ac\u03b12,\u00ac(q \u2227 \u00acp),\u00ac\u03b13,\u00ac\u03b14}, {p,\u00acq,\u00ac(p \u2227 q), p \u2227 \u00acq, \u03b11, \u03b12,\u00ac(q \u2227 \u00acp),\u00ac\u03b13,\u00ac\u03b14}, {\u00acp, q,\u00ac(p \u2227 q),\u00ac(p \u2227 \u00acq),\u00ac\u03b11,\u00ac\u03b12, q \u2227 \u00acp, \u03b13, \u03b14}}\nTo obtain mnacA,\u22a4(P ), we need to change the first three judgments of the first voter, obtaining the profile given in Table 23. This is the minimal change, since if either the second or the third agent change either their judgment on p or their judgment on q, they have to change additional other three\njudgments. We obtain mnacA,\u22a4(P ) = {{\u00acp,\u00acq,\u00ac(p \u2227 q),\u00ac(p \u2227 \u00ac q), \u00ac\u03b11,\u00ac\u03b12,\u00ac(q \u2227 \u00ac p),\u00ac\u03b13,\u00ac\u03b14}}. Thus, msa inc mnac.\n12. mnac is incomparable with y, ra and mwa. Example 3 shows that mnac inc ra and mnac inc y. Now consider the profile P from Table 23 and recall that mnacA,\u22a4(P ) = {{\u00acp,\u00acq,\u00ac(p \u2227 q),\u00ac(p \u2227 \u00ac q), \u00ac\u03b11,\u00ac\u03b12,\u00ac(q \u2227 \u00ac p),\u00ac\u03b13,\u00ac\u03b14}}. Observe that mwaA,\u22a4(P ) = {{p, q, p\u2227q,\u00ac(p\u2227\u00acq),\u00ac\u03b11,\u00ac\u03b12,\u00ac(q\u2227\u00acp),\u00ac\u03b13,\u00ac\u03b14}} since for this judgment set the weight is 17, and for the remaining three other possible judgment sets the weights are: 14 for the set of the judgment sets of the second, and third agent and 16 for the judgment set {\u00acp,\u00acq,\u00ac(p \u2227 q),\u00ac(p \u2227 \u00acq),\u00ac\u03b11,\u00ac\u03b12,\u00ac(q\u2227 \u00acp),\u00ac\u03b13,\u00ac\u03b14}.

A judgment aggregation rule is majority-preserving if whenever issuewise majority is consistent, the rule should output the majoritarian opinion on each issue. We provide a formal setting for relating judgment aggregation rules to voting rules and propose some basic properties for judgment aggregation rules. We consider six such rules some of which have already appeared in the literature, some others are new. For these rules we consider their relation to known voting rules, to each other, with respect to their discriminating power, and analyse them with respect to the considered properties.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
