Introduction", "text": "This article presents a study of the conceptualization of \u00abaltruism\u00bb from the\nsociological operationalization perspective and includes small-scale study which analyzes how the concept of altruism and its Russian equivalent \u00abvzaimopomoshh`\u00bb (mutual help) is used in Russian language. Operationalization is part of the empirical research process (Shields, Rangarjan 2013).\nTo translate the concept on \"the language of the questionnaire\", the\ndevelopment of in-depth semi-structured interview guide and to work with the transcript should be made operationalization - empirical interpretation of the concept, i.e. the procedure for describing concepts through a system of indicators, having the properties: a) measurable, b) the validity, c) repeatability. (Iliassov 2013)\nThe problem of definition of the spheres of application concepts is one of the\nmain for sociological operationalization in empirical research. However it gained less development in application to Russian. Our research relies on researches of a Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) (Wierzbicka 1972, 1992, 1997, 2002; Gladkova 2010, 2013). In opinion on this conception, linguist can compare different languages (and different terms into one language) objectively, if he (she) uses the semantic universals. However we are guided by discussions include the criticism of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) (Blumczy\u0144ski 2013). In previous work, we have noted that the boundaries of social categories in the Russian language have difficulty in clear determining (Volchkova, Pavenkova, 2002; Rubtsova. 2007, 2011; Pavenkov 2014).\nIn our view, the study of the concept should include the study of synonyms,\nas sociologists and respondents are often used them. It can be said that the theme of the use of synonyms in sociological studies rarely studied. In Russian concepts altruism and \u00abvzaimopomoshh`\u00bb (mutual help) are regarded as synonyms in many Russian theoretical concepts of Social Sciences. At the same time, they can be listed through a comma (Kropotkin 1988).\nTherefore, our main research questions are following:\n2\n1) Are the concepts \u00abaltruism\u00bb and \u00abvzaimopomoshh`\u00bb (mutual help) interchangeable? 2) Has the use of these words in oral and written speech essential differences?\nUsing the Russian National Corpus, we can establish similarities and\ndifferences in the use of word \u00abaltruism\u00bb in the context of \u00abvzaimopomoshh`\u00bb (mutual help) as Russian equivalent and try to find answer on our research questions.\nFor this aim we can formulate and check folowing hypothesises:\nHypothesis 1. The using of these words has not statistically significant differences. Hypothesis 2. The using of these words in oral and written speech has not statistically significant differences.\nTo confirm or disprove the hypotheses we describe the spheres of\napplication these words. So we analyze seven contexts of using words \u00abaltruism\u00bb and \u00abvzaimopomoshh`\u00bb. They are people`s actions, human himself, relations` quality, state, social institutes, organisations, conseptions-ideology."}, {"heading": "3. Data and Methodology", "text": "Based on the fact that the Russian language has two concepts denoting the\nclosest social phenomena \u2013 \u00abaltruism\u00bb and \u00abvzaimopomoshh`\u00bb (mutual help) which consider as synonymous we give a characterization of their most frequent usage as a main, newspaper and spoken Russian National Corpus.\nA corpus is a reference system based on an electronic collection of texts\ncomposed in a certain language. A national corpus represents that language at a stage (or several stages) of its development in all the variety of genres, styles, territorial and social variants of usage, etc. A national corpus is created by linguists for academic research and language teaching. A national corpus is distinguished by two features. Firstly, it is characterized by representative and well-balanced collections of texts. This means that such a corpus contains, if possible, all the types of written and oral texts present in the language (various genres of fiction, journalistic, academic, and business, as well as dialectal and sociolectal, texts). The\n3\nproportion of text types in the corpus is based on their share in real-life usage at the time of composition. Secondly, a corpus contains additional information on the properties of texts that are included. This is achieved by means of annotation. The annotation is a principal feature of the corpus, distinguishing the corpus from simple collections (also known as 'libraries') of texts on the Internet. Such libraries are not well suited to academic work on the nature of language; they tend to focus on the content of texts rather than their language properties, while the creators of the Corpus recognize the importance of literary or scientific value of the texts, but see them as a secondary feature. Unlike an electronic library, the National Corpus is not a collection of texts which are deemed 'interesting' or 'useful' of themselves; the texts in the Corpus are interesting and useful for the study of language. Such texts might include not only great works of literature, but also works of a 'secondary' writer, or a transcription of an ordinary conversation2.

We can imagine them on a graph (Fig.6)\n7\nDiscussion and conclusion\nWe had explored the use of the two Russian words \u2013 \u00abaltruism\u00bb and\n\u00abvzaimopomoshh`\u00bb (mutual help), which had the same meanings originally. The concepts \u00abaltruism\u00bb and \u00abvzaimopomoshh`\u00bb (mutual help) are regarded as synonyms in many Russian theoretical Social Sciences` concepts. Based on Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) and Russian National Corpus analysis we describe seven contexts of using words \u00abaltruism\u00bb and \u00abvzaimopomoshh`\u00bb: people`s actions, human himself, relations` quality, state, social institutes, organisations, conseptions-ideology.\nThe quantitative analyse shows differences in the use of these concepts.\nThe differences between the \u00abvzaimopomoshh`\u00bb (mutual help) and \u00abaltruism\u00bb are statistically significant for all three Russian corpuses: main, spoken and newspaper. Only in few contexts these concepts may be used as synonyms: as features of quality of relations, as conception and ideology.\nConcept \u00abAltruism\u00bb is often combined with pronouns and it is more\npersonal. The concept \u00abvzaimopomoshh`\u00bb (mutual help) originally occurred from the life of the Russian local community. However, in the 20th century, the state has done its template. This explains its frequent mention in the context of organizations, social institutions and the state. In these patterns, the lyrical meaning of \u00abhappy life together\u00bb is almost lost.\nIn conclusion we would like to emphasize the importance of this\noperationalization of concepts for empirical sociological research. We agree with Lazarsfeld (Lazarsfeld, 1962:579) that the operationalization of concepts is required. The conceptualization of social categories and prevents the loss of meaning, which is important when we conduct in-depth interviews, focus groups and in data processing of transcripts.\nIn future studies, we would have paid more attention to the replenishment\nof the spoken Russian National Corpus with sociological interview transcripts, search for social differences in the use of terms and reconsidered these concepts."}], "references": [{"title": "Famous theories surrounding emotional intelligence: A historical review", "author": ["I.
