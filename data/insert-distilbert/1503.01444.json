Low-rank matrix approximation methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [29] and matrix factorization [7], [18], [40], [48] are widely used to find the best approximation of an underlying low-rank structure of data. However many of these approaches are error-prone due to the presence of outliers. To recover the low-rank matrix while rejecting outliers, a rank minimization based Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) [9] has been proposed and gained much interest in computer vision [28], [38], [45], [47].\nRPCA [9] aims to recover a low-rank matrix A \u2208 Rm\u00d7n from corrupted observations O = A+E, where E \u2208 Rm\u00d7n represents errors with arbitrary magnitude and distribution. The rank minimization approach [9], [10], [39], [43] assumes E is sparse and formulates the problem as:\nmin A,E\nrank(A) + \u03bb\u2016E\u20160, s.t.

E-mail: jean-charles.bazin@inf.ethz.ch\nin Eq. (1) is an NP-hard problem. The rank minimization approach instead solves an approximated problem by convex surrogate as:\nmin A,E\n\u2016A\u2016\u2217 + \u03bb\u2016E\u20161, s.t. O = A+E, (2)\nwhere \u2016A\u2016\u2217 = \u2211\ni \u03c3i(A) is the nuclear norm of A, \u03c3i(A) represents the i-th singular value of A (sorted in decreasing order) , and \u2016E\u20161 is the l1-norm of E. Eq. (2) can be solved effectively by various methods [31], [44]. Wright et al. [43] and Cande\u0300s et al. [9] proved that, under mild conditions, the unique solution of Eq. (2) exactly corresponds to the solution of the original NP-hard problem in Eq. (1). Yet, when the number of observations in O is very limited, experiments show that the converged solution includes some outliers as inliers and vice versa. Such limited number of observations is not uncommon in many computer vision problems due to practical reasons. For example, in HDR context, often only 2-4 differently exposed images are captured and photometric stereo requires only 3 images in theory. Moreover, we also observe that the converged solution can be degenerated. For instance, in the photometric stereo problem [45], the solution of A might have a rank lower than the theoretical rank of 3.\nIn this paper, based on the prior knowledge about the rank of A, we propose an alternative objective function which minimizes the Partial Sum of Singular Values (abbreviated to PSSV) of A:\nmin A,E\n\u2016A\u2016p=N + \u03bb\u2016E\u20161, s.t.O = A+E, (3)\nwhere \u2016A\u2016p = \u2211min(m,n)\ni=p+1 \u03c3i(A) and N is the target rank of A which can be derived from the problem definition, e.g. N = 1 for background subtraction, N = 3 for photometric stereo. Eq. (3) minimizes the rank of residual errors of A\nar X\niv :1\n50 3.\n01 44\n4v 2\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n3 A\nug 2\n01 5\n2 against the target rank, instead of the nuclear norm. A major drawback of using the nuclear norm to approximate the l0-norm of singular values is that the nuclear norm minimizes not only the rank of A, but also the variance of A by simultaneously minimizing all the singular values of A including the singular values within the target rank N , i.e. \u03c31\u2264i\u2264N . Consequently, the low-rank structure of A may not be well approximated under the environment that does not follow the assumption of large number of inputs.\nAlthough Eq. (3) is non-convex, we observe in our experiments that Eq. (3) encourages the resulting low-rank matrix to have a rank close to N even with deficient observations. For example, when the singular values of A within the target rank are small, the nuclear norm can result in a rank deficient matrix A, i.e. whose rank is smaller than the target rank. In contrast, because our work does not minimize the subspace variance of A within the target rank, we are not biased to the solution with smaller variance of A. Thus, the low-rank matrix A can be more accurately estimated. Further analyses and discussions about this claim are provided in the later sections of our paper.\nIn contrast to matrix factorization methods where the a priori rank constraint is enforced as a hard constraint via matrix projection, we encourage the rank constraint as a soft constraint and propose the Partial Singular Value Thresholding (PSVT) to solve our partial sum singular value objective function. As analyzed in our study, the PSVT operator encourages the result A to meet the target rank even when all the singular values are small.\nThis work is the extension of our previous conference paper [33]. We empirically study the proposed objective function in many low-level vision problems, e.g. HDR imaging, motion boundary detection, photometric stereo, image alignment, and image recovery where the theoretical rank of A is known and the number of observations is limited (except the image recovery application). Our experimental analyses show that our formulation, described in Eq. (3), converges to a solution more robust to outliers than the solution obtained by the objective function in Eq. (2) in rank minimization, when the number of observations is limited. Empirically, we also find that the solutions of Eq. (2) (nuclear norm) and Eq. (3) (our PSSV) are almost identical when more than a sufficient number of samples is observed.\nIn short summary, our contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We present a partial sum objective function and its corresponding minimization method for RPCA. \u2022 We empirically study the partial sum objective function and claim that it outperforms the nuclear norm rank minimization when the number of observed samples is very limited. \u2022 We present the convergence property of the proposed algorithm to minimize the proposed partial sum objective function consisting of PSSV and sparse term, and provide its proof. \u2022 We apply our technique on various low-level vision problems and demonstrate superior results over previous works."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORKS", "text": "In this section, we briefly review early works related to RPCA, then we discuss some recent advances in RPCA and its applications in computer vision. We will also review some recent matrix factorization based works for low-rank approximation. We invite readers to refer to Cande\u0300s et al. [9] for a thoughtful review of RPCA.\nIn conventional PCA [29], the goodness-of-fit of data is evaluated by the l2-norm which is very sensitive to outliers. Early works in RPCA tried to reduce the effects of outliers by random sampling [19], robust M-estimator [12], [13], or alternating minimization [30] to identify outliers or penalize data with large errors. These methods share some limitations: either they are sensitive to the choice of parameters or their algorithms are not scalable enough in running time.\nRecent advances in RPCA showed that the heuristic nuclear norm solution [9], [39], [43] converges to a solution which is robust to sparse outliers. Cande\u0300s et al. [9] proved that the original RPCA problem as in Eq. (1) can be solved by instead solving the convex relaxation version in Eq. (2), and it provides a unique and exact solution of Eq. (1) as long as E is sparse and random and the underlying rank(A) is lower than a certain upper bound1. To solve Eq. (2), various methods have been proposed [31], [44]. Among them, Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM, or also called inexact augmented Lagrange multiplier) [31] has shown to be computationally efficient. Also, Zhou et al. [49] and Agarwal et al. [1] proved that convex approximation by nuclear norm can still achieve bounded and stable results even under small noise measurements.\nBesides the standard nuclear norm relaxation, some works study variants of the nuclear norm to enhance performance of rank minimization [11], [20], [24]. Chen et al. [11] and Gaiffas et al. [20] proposed an adaptive weighted nuclear norm. They suggested a non-trivial update scheme to update the adaptive weighted nuclear norm and claimed to achieve higher accuracy in low-rank matrix approximation in comparison with the standard nuclear norm. Hu et al. [24] proposed the truncated nuclear norm (TNN) for the matrix completion problem which shares a similar objective function with our PSSV objective function. Since the TNN is non-convex (which is not easy to directly solve), they aim to avoid direct minimization by locally approximating TNN as minX,W \u2016X\u2016\u2217 \u2212Tr(AlWB l ), s.t. X = W by alternatively minimizing Al, Bl, X and W based on the singular value thresholding (SVT) operator [8]. This alternating scheme requires outer iterations and additional SVD computations. Instead of utilizing this alternating scheme, we propose the PSVT operator to directly minimize the partial sum of singular value term. Although our objective function is also non-convex, our proposed PSVT produces the closedform solution to the sum of the PSSV and proximity term. In that sense, every sub-problem of our problem has a closed-form solution. Thus, our optimization problem can be solved efficiently. Moreover, while the approach of Hu et al. is dedicated only to matrix completion, we show that our work can be successfully applied for several computer\n1. The bound depends on the matrix size.\n3 vision tasks spanning from image alignment to photometric stereo and HDR imaging.\nAnother branch of low-rank framework is based on Matrix Factorization (MF). Several robust MF methods based on l1-norm have been suggested [7], [18], [48]. A benefit of matrix factorization approaches is that they can easily enforce the rank constraint by the explicit bilinear matrix form. The target rank constraint is enforced as a hard constraint via matrix reprojection or orthogonal procrustes. Cabral et al. [7] revisited the relationship between nuclear norm regularization and bilinear MF model [2], and proposed a rank continuation heuristic to avoid local minima. Compared with MFs, our target rank constraint is expressed as a soft constraint which provides flexibility to balance between the rank constraint and other constraints used in different computer vision problems.\nThe robustness and scalability of the rank minimization algorithm for RPCA [9], [31], [44] have inspired many applications in computer vision, such as background subtraction [9], image and video restoration [28], image alignment [38], regular texture analysis [47], and robust photometric stereo [45]. These applications are based on the observation that the underlying structures of clean data are linearly correlated, which forms a low-rank data matrix. The rank minimization proposed by Cande\u0300s et al. [9] is general in the sense that it does not require to know a priori the rank of clean data. However, as briefly mentioned in the introduction, in some applications, the rank of clean data can be determined by the problem definition, and this motivates us to investigate how the prior rank information can be fully utilized in the context of RPCA.\nThe success of rank minimization based RPCA comes from the blessing of dimensionality of input matrix [16], [43], implying large amount of observations. However, when the number of observations is limited, which is common in practice, results from RPCA might be degenerated, e.g. correct samples might be considered as outliers and vice versa. As discussed in the introduction, this happens because the standard nuclear norm minimizes not only the rank of the matrix, but also the variance of data distribution of the matrix. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an alternative objective function that can efficiently deal with a deficient number of samples in the rank minimization problem. Our work can be considered as an addendum to the standard rank minimization approach when the target rank or the approximate target rank is known. The proposed alternative objective function can control the rank with a simple and efficient minimizer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed objective function through thoughtful experiments."}, {"heading": "3 PARTIAL SUM MINIMIZATION BY THE PSVT OPERATOR", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Derivation of Partial Sum of Singular Values", "text": "Our partial sum formulation in Eq.

(4) aims to recover a low-rank matrix A close to the target rank N and a sparse error matrix E.\nSince the above objective function is also an NP-hard problem, we relax it with an alternative representation in order to effectively deal with it. The relaxation is similar to the method presented by Cande\u0300s et al. [9]. We should also properly interpret the target rank N . We relax it with a projection operator to enforce a rank-N matrix in a matrix interpretation manner. From the relaxation, the PSSV objective function, which is the first term in Eq.

(5) leads us to the PSSV objective function in Eq. (3). In this section, we show the relationship between the target rank N and the projection operator in Eq. (5). We first introduce a rank representation.\nLemma 1. Let A \u2208 Rm\u00d7n and rank(A) \u2265 r, then there exist matrices C \u2208 Rr\u00d7m and B \u2208 Rn\u00d7r such that CC = B B = I \u2208 Rr\u00d7r and\nrank(CAB) = r. (7)\nProof. Let UDV be SVD of A. Suppose C = U 1:r and B = V1:r, where U1:r and V1:r are the matrices consisting of the singular vectors corresponding to the r largest singular values. C and B satisfy rank(CAB) = r, which concludes the proof.\nThe constant r can be represented in the matrix form with Lemma 1. Now, we show the characteristics of the presented solution by SVD in Lemma 1 with Lemma 2.\nLemma 2. For any u = {w|w\u22a5span{u1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,uk\u22121}}, v = {w|w\u22a5span{v1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,vk\u22121}} and A \u2208 Rm\u00d7n,\n\u03c3k = max u,v |u Av| \u2016u\u2016 \u2016v\u2016 .

In (b), some inliers located on the ground truth sub-space are regarded as outliers to achieve a smaller singular value.\n0 1 2 3 4 0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nx\nM ag\nni tu\nde\nNuclear norm Partial sum\n(a)\n0 1 2 3 4 0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nx\nM ag\nni tu\nde\nNuclear norm Partial sum\n(b)\nFig. 2: A toy example comparison between the nuclear norm solution and the PSSV solution.

The graphs show the nuclear norm and the PSSV of 2 \u00d7 2 matrices A = [1 1; 3x] in (a) and [1 1; 1x] in (b) with x varying from 0 to 4. In (a), the minimum point of nuclear norm is at x = 1 where the singular values of A are equal to [3.4142, 0.5858] (i.e., rank-2). As for the PSSV, the minimum point is at x = 3 with singular values equal to [4.4721, 0.0000] (i.e., rank1). In this toy example, the nuclear norm favors a rank-2 solution over a rank-1 solution because the rank-2 solution provides the minimum nuclear norm. In contrast, the PSSV achieves the lowest rank (rank-1) solution. In (b), when the basis of the first row of A is partially supported by another sample (second row), the nuclear norm and the PSSV both achieve the rank-1 solution at minima.\nThough the solution satisfying Lemma 1 is not unique, the solution of Eq. (9) can be a way to represent the target rank constraint. Therefore, we relax the target rank constant to the nuclear norm representation in Eq. (9) with U1:r and V1:r which satisfy both Lemma 1 and Eq. (9). In summary, we show the first term in Eq. (4) can be relaxed as PSSV by Lemmas 1 and 2, and the introduced projection operator Pr(\u00b7) (see Definition 1) favors preserving the information of the r largest singular values. Intuitively, when rank(A) \u2265 r, as \u03c3i>N (A) \u2192 0 (namely minimized), rank(A) \u2192 N . Of course, if rank(O) < N , i.e. if the inputs are degenerated, the rank of A cannot be increased to meet the target rank. This is a fundamental limitation. In common cases where input data contains noise or outliers, the inequality condition rank(A) \u2265 r is easily satisfied, because data corruptions increase the rank of input data."}, {"heading": "3.1.2 Why the partial sum of singular values?", "text": "A major advantage of using the PSSV over the nuclear norm is that it does not minimize the variance of data distribution within the target rank. Minimizing the nuclear norm can favor a solution that has a lower nuclear norm, but the singular values in residual ranks (singular values above the target rank N . Let N=1 here) can be still large as illustrated in Fig. 1-(a) and Fig. 2-(a). This bias can\ndegrade the accuracy of the estimated low-rank subspace. The bias phenomenon by a convex surrogate is common, and it could be corrected by non-convex relaxation [46]. An additional issue is that if the ground truth has a large variance but a sparse distribution within the ground truth subspace, some inliers can be regarded as outliers in order to reduce the singular values within the target rank, as illustrated in Fig. 1-(b) and at the minimum point of nuclear norm in Fig. 2-(a). These two problems are not an issue when there is a lot of observed data to support the correct estimation of A. However, when observed data is limited, minimizing nuclear norm can easily cause bias since there is not a sufficient number of truth samples to support large variance of A within the target rank. In contrast, the PSSV does not assume small variance of A, and it only minimizes variances in residual rank which corresponds to minimizing the noise variance of observed data.

Let\u2019s consider X = UXDXV X = \u2211l i=1 \u03c3i(X)uiv i where UX = [u1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , um] \u2208 Um, VX = [v1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vn] \u2208 Un and DX = diag(\u03c3(X)), where the singular values \u03c3(\u00b7) = [\u03c31(\u00b7), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c3l(\u00b7)] \u2265 0 are sorted in a non-increasing order. Also we define the function J(X) as the objective function of Eq. (16). The first term of Eq. (16) can be derived as follows:\n1 2 \u2016X\u2212Y\u20162F = 1 2\n( \u2016Y\u20162F \u2212 2\u3008X,Y\u3009+ \u2016X\u20162F )\n= 1\n2\n( \u2016Y\u20162F \u2212 2 l\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c3i(X)u i Yvi +\nl\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c3i(X) 2\n)\n= 1\n2 \u2016Y\u20162F +\n1\n2\nl\u2211\ni=1\n( \u22122\u03c3i(X)u i Yvi + \u03c3i(X)2 ) .\n(18)\nIn the minimization of Eq. (18) with respect to X, \u2016Y\u20162F is regarded as a constant and thus can be ignored. For a more\ndetailed representation, we change the parameterization of X to (UX ,VX ,DX) and minimize the function:\nJ(UX ,VX ,DX) = (19)\n1\n2\nl\u2211\ni=1\n( \u22122\u03c3i(X)u i Yvi + \u03c3i(X)2 ) + \u03c4 l\u2211\ni=N+1\n\u03c3i(X).\nFrom von Neumann\u2019s lemma, the upper bound of u i Yvi is given as \u03c3i(Y) = max { u i Yvi } for all i when UX = UY and VX = VY . The lower envelope of J(UX ,VX ,DX) is obtained at UX = UY and VX = VY . Then Eq. (19) becomes a function depending only on DX as follows:\nJ(UY ,VY ,DX) (20)\n= 1\n2\nl\u2211\ni=1\n( \u22122\u03c3i(X)\u03c3i(Y) + \u03c3i(X)2 ) + \u03c4 l\u2211\ni=N+1\n\u03c3i(X)\n= 1\n2\n( N\u2211\ni=1\n( \u22122\u03c3i(X)\u03c3i(Y) + \u03c3i(X)2 )\n+ l\u2211\ni=N+1\n( \u22122\u03c3i(X)\u03c3i(Y) + \u03c3i(X)2 + 2\u03c4\u03c3i(X) ) ) .\nSince Eq. (20) consists of simple quadratic equations for each \u03c3i(X) independently, it is trivial to show that the minimum of Eq. (20) is obtained at D\u0302X = diag(\u03c3\u0302(X)) by derivative in a feasible domain as the first-order optimality condition, where \u03c3\u0302i(X) is defined as\n\u03c3\u0302i(X) = { \u03c3i(Y), if i < N + 1, max (\u03c3i(Y)\u2212 \u03c4, 0) , otherwise. (21)\nHence, the solution of Eq. (16) is X\u2217 = UY D\u0302XVTY. This result exactly corresponds to the PSVT operator where a feasible solution X\u2217 = UY (DY 1 + S\u03c4 [DY 2])V Y exists.\nOur proposed PSVT can be regarded as a special case of solving the weighted nuclear norm based objective function of Chen et al. [11] and Ga\u0131\u0308ffas et al. [20]. But we would like to notice that our method suggests how the weighted parameter (defined in their literatures) can be determined to encourage the rank constraint. Also, notice that our proposed PSVT operator provides a closed-form solution for systems of the same form as Eq. (16) (e.g. Eq. (11)). While Eq. (11) is a non-convex function, the PSVT provides a global optimal solution for the sub-problem of A (see the proof of Theorem 1).\nAs an analysis of PSVT, when \u03c4 = \u221e, the optimal solution of Eq. (16) is a low-dimensional projection of Y known as singular value projection [27] which enforces the target rank constraint through projection. When \u03c3i < \u03c4 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N , conventional SVT [8] projects these \u03c3i to zero resulting in a more deficient rank of A than the target rank while our PSVT does not lead to rank deficient matrices. Hence, PSVT implicitly encourages the resulting matrix A to meet the target rank even when all the \u03c3i are small, which occasionally happens when the number of observed samples is limited.\n6"}, {"heading": "3.4 Solving E\u2217", "text": "As suggested by Hale et al.

The ADMM for non-convex problems can be considered as a local optimization method, which aims to converge to a point with better objective value [4].\nIn our problem, each sub-problem has a closed-form solution and the objective value is always decreasing with respect to the primal variables optimized in each subproblem iteration2. Our empirical convergence tests showed\n2. It does not mean a monotonic decrease of the Lagrangian function, which is not necessarily monotone due to the dual update.\nthat our ADMM based algorithm has a strong convergence behavior (see Sec. 4.1). Although the global optimal solution is not guaranteed, all of our experiments showed that our algorithm converges to a solution which is very close to the nuclear norm solution, when the number of observations is more than sufficient. It also converges to a better solution than the nuclear norm solution when the number of observations is limited, even with all zero initializations.\nBesides the empirical behavior, we provide the convergence property for Alg. 1 in Proposition 1. It shows that any accumulation point (limit point) generated along the iterations satisfies the first-order necessary optimal condition, a KKT (Karush-Kuhn-Tucker) point.\nProposition 1 (Convergence).

The input is a set of low dynamic range (LDR) images and the goal is to composite an HDR image using RPCA to reject outliers, such as moving objects and saturations, in the LDR images. We assume that the differently exposed images Ii are aligned and the camera response function (CRF) is calibrated (or linear). Then, the captured images can be represented as Ii = \u03baR\u0394ti, where R denotes the sensor irradiance, \u0394ti is the exposure time of the i-th image, and \u03ba is a positive scalar. We construct the observed intensity matrix O \u2208 Rm\u00d7n = [vec(I1)| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |vec(In)] by stacking the vectorized input images, where m and n are the number of pixels and images respectively. Since the intensities of the input images are linearly dependent, the ideal solution of this problem is rank-1. However, in practice, rank(O) is higher than 1 due to moving objects, saturation or other artifacts (illustrated in Fig. 12). We apply RPCA (nuclear norm) and our method (PSSV) to each color channel independently, in order to separate artifacts and background scene.\nThe Arch and Sculpture Garden datasets from Gallo et al. [21] are used for evaluation. The estimated backgrounds as low-rank matrix and the sparse outliers from RPCA and our method are shown in Fig. 13. The example in Fig. 13-(a) consists of only 5 input images which is very limited. Ideally, the decomposed low-rank matrix A = [vec(A1)| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |vec(An)] consists of relative intensities of the\n10\nbackground scene from which moving objects or saturation artifacts should be removed (see Fig. 13-(b,d)). RPCA returns a low-rank matrix whose magnitude differs drastically from the input image, as shown in Fig. 13-(b). Moreover RPCA yields a dense non-zero entries in E, instead of being sparse, as shown in Fig. 13-(c). This situation is similar to the example in Fig. 2 where the minimum nuclear norm favors a solution with smaller variance of magnitudes. In contrast, our proposed method shows a correctly modeled background scene and successfully detects outlier regions, as shown in Fig. 13-(d,e). For displaying the sparse components in Fig. 13-(c,e), each color component (R,G,B) is set with (|ER|, |EG|, |EB |), where E{R,G,B} denotes sparse error matrix for each channel.\nAfter we estimate the low-rank matrix, we composite the HDR images using the standard method of Debevec et al. [15]. The final HDR results are shown in Fig. 14. Because the background modelling by RPCA is inaccurate, ghosting appears in their HDR results. In contrast, our results are ghost-free."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Motion Detection by Temporal Edge", "text": "RPCA-based background modeling for surveillance purpose requires a large number of observations to estimate background and moving objects under global illumination changes. Such requirement is not suitable for online algorithm in surveillance. Using a few images as input, the moving region detection by RPCA could fail due to the limited number of observations. In this problem, we observe that edge images make moving object boundaries more sparse and they rarely overlap. We stack a few n edge images (obtained by Sobel operator) in video sequence as column vectors of a matrix O \u2208 Rm\u00d7n = [vec(O1)| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |vec(On)]. Without moving objects, the edge pixels on the background texture are static, so the matrix O should be low-rank, essentially, rank-1. Since moving object regions are not consistent with background edges, the regions can be modeled as sparse outliers.\nFig. 15 shows the comparisons with RPCA and the proposed method. RPCA fails to decompose low\u2013rank and sparse matrix in Fig. 15-(b) due to deficient observations where n = 5. On the other hand, our method successfully estimates moving object boundary, and the results are similar to the one obtained with many observations in Fig. 15- (e).\n11"}, {"heading": "4.2.3 Outlier Rejection for Photometric Stereo", "text": "Intensity observation is modeled in Lambertian photometric stereo as O = [vec(O1)| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |vec(On)] = N L4, where O \u2208 Rm\u00d7n, N \u2208 R3\u00d7m and L \u2208 R3\u00d7n denote measured intensity, normal and light direction matrix, respectively, and m and n are the number of pixels and images. Hayakawa et al. [23] show that the intensity matrix lies in a subspace of rank 3, as illustrated in Fig. 16. However, this constraint is hardly satisfied in real situations due to shadow from self-occlusion, saturation and some object materials which do not exactly follow the Lambertian diffusion model. Considering the rank-3 constraint, the artifacts mentioned above can be regarded as sparse outliers and we get a lowrank structure as O = N L+E.\nThe robust photometric stereo with outlier rejection can be formulated as a RPCA problem as suggested by Wu et al. [45]. We compare our method with the standard least square (LS) method [42] and RPCA by Wu et al. [45]. Among them, Wu et al. and our method do not require light information (i.e. uncalibrated setting), while the LS method requires light calibration a priori. Thus, RPCA based outlier rejection is a more challenging problem than the robust regression given light information [26]. The LS based photometric stereo estimates the normals by minimizing \u2016O\u2212N L\u20162F . We corrupt some input images by painted artifacts to mimic outliers. The corrupted inputs are included in 2 out of n = 5 inputs (Fig. 17 and Fig. 18-(top)), and 4 out of n = 10 inputs (Fig. 18-(bottom)). Outlier rejection results are shown in Fig. 17. We present qualitative comparison of normal recovery results in Fig. 17 and Fig. 18. Wu et al. return a planar surface normal when the rank of input matrix is lower than 3 due to the lack of observations (italic in Table 2). When more input images are available, RPCA begins to return detail preserved results, as shown in Fig. 18-(e). On the other hand, our method consistently provides robust results for both limited and sufficient observations, as shown in Fig. 18-(c,f).\nFor quantitative results, we use the Bunny dataset [26] generated using the Cook-Torrance reflectance model and consisting of 40 different lighting conditions. The average ratio of specular and shadow regions in Bunny are 8.4% and 24% respectively, which act as outliers. Table 3 shows quantitative results. We vary the number of images and add 5% of uniformly distributed corruption. Each value in Table 3 is averaged over 20 randomly selected test sets. Wu et al. [45] produce degenerated results, as the rank of the resulting matrix is lower than 3 due to the lack of supports from the observations. When more input images are available, RPCA returns more satisfying results, but still the accuracy is lower than LS method. In contrast,\n4. Note that the intensities only on the object region are used in the observation matrix O with the corresponding object mask.\nour method provides accurate results for both limited and sufficient observations."}, {"heading": "4.2.4 Batch Image Alignment", "text": "Given several images of an object of interest (e.g. face), the batch image alignment task aims to align them to a fixed canonical template [6], [38]. In this problem, we search for a transformation gi for each image Ii to make the images linearly correlated. We note g the set of transformations: g = {g1, . . . , gn} where n is the number of images and write O \u25e6 g = [vec(I1 \u25e6 gi)| \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |vec(In \u25e6 gn)]. Contrary to the formulation of Peng et al. [38], we consider PSSV mathematically formulated as follows:\nargmin A,E,g\n\u2016A\u2016p=N + \u03bb\u2016E\u20161, s.t. O \u25e6 g = A+E. (24)\nWe applied our approach to the head dataset acquired under varying poses (see Fig. 20-(a)) [38]. For linearly correlated noise-free batch images, the rank is N = 1, when the transformations for exact image alignment are estimated. Our results of alignment, low-rank estimation and error sparsity are shown in Fig. 20-(e,f,g). Compared to the results obtained by RASL [38], our method can correctly detect the outliers (Fig. 20-(c) v.s. Fig. 20-(f)), even with only 3 input images.\nOur method can correctly detect the outliers and also robustly align the images even if the geometric model has more degrees of freedom than an affine homography model. Detailed comparisons in Fig. 22 show the average image obtained from the aligned image stack by each method. If well aligned, the average image should show seamless image without duplicated edges. Our results show fine average images due to more accurate homography estimation than RASL."}, {"heading": "4.2.5 Image Recovery", "text": "Images of natural scenes follow natural statistics [25]. As shown by Hu et al. [24], information of image scenes is\n12\ndominated by the top 20 singular values, which is lowrank. Hu et al. [24] proposed a matrix completion method with the truncated nuclear norm (TNN) as introduced in Sec. 2. We formulate the matrix completion as\nargmin A,B\n\u2016A\u2016p, s.t.

Although the auxiliary variable B looks unnecessary, with the affine constraint (the projection operator) it makes the efficient PSVT operator applicable in ADMM algorithm. We set \u03c1 = 1.05 in ADMM (see the supplementary material and Alg. 2), and for fairness, we follow the same setting as suggested by Hu et al., i.e. \u03bc0 = 1e\u22123.\nFig. 23 shows the comparison with Hu et al. Since the proposed method has a similar objective function with Hu et al., PSNR of recovered images are similar (the max. difference is 0.134), but our method requires fewer iterations and runs 4 times faster. Because Hu et al. perform local approximation to solve PSSV, their algorithm requires outer\nloop to fix subspaces and inner loop to minimize nuclear norm with affine constraint. In contrast, our method directly minimizes PSSV, which is a key contribution of our work."}, {"heading": "5 DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we revisited the rank minimization method in RPCA for low-level vision problems. When the target rank is known, we show that, by modifying the objective function from the nuclear norm to PSSV, we can achieve a better control of the target rank of the low-rank solution, even when the number of observations is limited. The appealing advantage of our solution is that it can be easily utilized in existing algorithms, e.g. ADMM [31], and the efficient computation properties still hold. The generality and the effectiveness of our approach are supported through numerous and extensive experiments on both synthetic examples and several real-world applications which outperform the conventional nuclear norm objective function. We do not consider scalability issues of our method in this paper, but the recent approach suggested by Oh et al. [37] allow to speed-up the application of our method. An interesting direction of future work is the mathematical analysis of the properties of our partial sum objective function compared\n13\nto the nuclear norm solution. In the following, we discuss some open questions related to our paper. Sufficient number of samples versus minimum number of samples In our experimental analysis, we found that our solution is more robust than the nuclear norm solution when facing a limited number of samples. DefiningK as the (theoretical) minimum number of samples for processing, e.g. 2 images for HDR, 3 images for photometric stereo, our approach requires more than K samples for a robust model estimation and outlier rejection. We believe that the number of needed additional samples depends on the problem setting, e.g. the shape of feature space or the distribution of the samples. Target rank While our formulation implicitly encourages a target rank constraint in the resulting matrix, this constraint is hardly enforced. We discuss here two possible scenarios that can produce the resulting matrix having a rank different from the target rank. The first scenario is when a very limited number of samples are observed. In such case, PSVT can produce a deficient rank lower than the target rank when the span of the observed samples is less than the target rank, but this case is a fundamental limitation of under-sampling rather than a conceptual limitation of our approach. Another scenario is due to too much noise (especially for Gaussian noise that does not follow the sparsity property) in the observed samples which results in large singular values in the residual ranks. In this case, a solution to satisfy the rank constraint is to increase \u03c4 in Eq. (17). When \u03c4 is equal to infinity, our PSVT solution is close to the result using singular value projection [27]. However, the projection method enforcing target rank could produce an over-fitting solution due to the mentioned noise effects."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "We would like to thank reviewers and associate editor for their valuable comments, and thank Steve Seitz and Dan Goldman for the photometric stereo dataset.

Yet, when applying conventional rank minimization for those problems, the objective function is formulated in a way that does not fully utilize a priori target rank information about the problems. This observation motivates us to investigate whether there is a better alternative solution when using rank minimization.
