In [1], a neural network based algorithm for automatic provisioning to credit risk scrutiny in a real world problem is presented. An assimilated back propagation neural network (BPNN) with the customary discriminant analysis approach used to discover the performance of credit scoring is given in [2]. A comparative study of corporate credit rating analysis using back propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector machines (SVM) is described in [3]. An uncorrelated maximization algorithm within a triple-phase neural network ensemble technique for credit risk evaluation to differentiate good creditors from bad ones are elucidated in [4]. An application of artificial neural network to credit risk assessment using two altered architectures are deliberated in [5]. Credit risk investigation using diverse Data Mining models like C4.5, NN, BP, RIPPER, LR and SMO islikened in [6]. The credit risk of a Tunisian bank through modeling the non-payment risk of its commercial loans is analyzed in [7]. Credit risk valuation using six stage neural network ensemble learning approach is argued in [8]. A modeling framework for credit calculation models is erected using different modeling procedures is explained and its performance is analyzed in [9]. Hybrid method for assessing credit risk using KolmogoroveSmirnov test, Fuzzy Expert system and DEMATEL method is enlightened in [10]. An Artificial Neural Network centeredmethodology for Credit Risk supervision is proposed in [11]. Artificial neural networks using Feed-forward back propagation neural network and business rules to correctly determine credit defaulter is proposed in [12]. The performance comparison of Memory based classifiers for credit risk investigation is experimented and pr\u00e9cised in [13]. The performance comparison between Instance Based and K Star Classifiers for Credit Risk Inspection is accomplished and pronounced in [14]. The performance comparison among Sequential Minimal Optimization and Logistic Classifiers for Credit Risk Calculation is specified in [15]. The performance comparisonbetween Multilayer Perceptron and SMO Classifier for Credit Risk appraisal is described in [16]. The performance comparison between JRip and PART Classifier for Credit Risk Estimation is explored in [17]. Tree based classifiers are easier to interpret and explain. That\u2019s the reason; this research work randomly taken LAD Tree classifier and REP Tree Classifier which are used in various optimization literatures [23] for efficiency comparison. LAD Tree and REP Tree Classifiers have already used in various domain of problem like Forensic Mining [24], Intrusion Detection system [25] and [36], Non-spatial Data Classification [26], Classification for Bank Direct Marketing [27], Global land cover classification [28], Medical Data Classification [29], [30] and [34] , Automatic classification of active objects from large categories [31], Micro array dataset classification and analysis [32], Classification of Strom type from weather radar reflectivity [33], Identification of Link Spam in Web search Engines [35], etc. 3.DATASET USED The German credit data [18] is used to evaluate the performance of Logistic classifier and Partial Decision Tree Classifier for credit risk prediction. This data setcontains 20 attributes, namely, Duration, Credit History, Checking Status, Purpose, Credit Amount, Employment, Installment Commitment, Saving Status, Personal Status, Other parties, Property magnitude, Age, resident since, Other payment plans, existing credits, job, Housing, No. of dependents, Foreign worker and Own Phone. The data set comprises 1000 instances of client credit data with class detail. It discriminates the records into two classes, namely, good and bad. 4.METHODOLOGY USED\nIn this research work, two diversetree based classifiers namely, LAD Tree Classifierand REP Tree Classifier are compared for proficiencyassessment of credit risk estimation. 4.1.LAD Tree Classifier LAD Tree builds a classifier for binary target variable based on learning a logical expression that can discriminate between positive and negative samples in a data set. The construction of LAD model for a given data set typically involves the generation of large set patterns and the selection of a subset of them that satisfies the above assumption that a binary point covered by some positive patterns, but not covered by any negative pattern is positive, and similarly, a binary point covered by some negative patterns, but not covered by positive pattern is negative, such that each pattern in the model satisfies certain requirements in terms of prevalence and homogeneity[23]. LAD Tree Classifier generates a multi-class alternating decision tree using the Logit Boost strategy. The LAD Tree algorithm applies logistic boosting algorithm in order to induce an alternating decision tree. In this algorithm, a single attribute test is chosen as a splitter node for the tree at each iteration. For each training instance, working response and weights are calculated and stored on a per-class basis. Then, it fits the working response to the mean value of the instances, in a particular subset, by minimizing the least-squares value between them. IN this algorithm, trees for the different classes are grown in parallel. Once all the trees have been constructed, then it merges the trees into a final model. Advantage of this classifier is the size of the tree cannot outgrow the combined size of the individual trees [19]. 4.2.REP Tree Classifier Reduces Error Pruning (REP) Tree Classifier is a fast decision tree learning algorithm and is based on the principle of computing the information gain with entropy and minimizing the error arising from variance [20]. This algorithm is first recommended in [21]. REP Tree applies regression tree logic and generates multiple trees in altered iterations. Afterwards it picks best one from all spawned trees. This algorithm constructs the regression/decision tree using variance and information gain. Also, this algorithm prunes the tree using reduced-error pruning with back fitting method. At the beginning of the model preparation, it sorts the values of numeric attributes once. As in C4.5 Algorithm, this algorithm also deals the missing values by splitting the corresponding instances into pieces.[22]. 5.PERFORMANCE MEASURES USED Variousscales are used to gauge the performance of the classifiers."}, {"heading": "Classification Accuracy", "text": "Any classifier could have an error rate and it may fail to categorize correctly. Classification accuracy is calculated as Correctly classified instances divided by Total number of instances multiplied by 100. Mean Absolute Error\nMean absolute error is the average of the variance between predicted and actual value in all test cases. It is a good measure to gauge the performance."}, {"heading": "Root Mean Square Error", "text": "Root mean squared error is used to scaledissimilarities between values actually perceived and the values predicted by the model. It is determined by taking the square root of the mean square error."}, {"heading": "Confusion Matrix", "text": "A confusion matrix encompasses information about actual and predicted groupings done by a classification system. 6.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Open source machine learning tool is used to experiment the performance of LAD Tree and REP Tree Classifiers.
