Fuzzy representation is described by a single parameter, degree of truth  , while the degree of falsity  has a de-\nfault value calculated by negation formula :\n 1 (1.1)\nand the degree of neutrality has a default value that is 0 . Fuzzy intuitionistic representation is described by two explicit parameters, degree of truth  and degree of falsity\n , while the degree of neutrality has a default value that is 0 . Atanassov considered the incomplete variant taking into account that 1 . This allowed defining the index of\nignorance (incompleteness) with the formula:\n 1 (1.2)\nthus obtaining a consistent representation of information, because the sum of the three parameters is 1 , namely:\n1  (1.3)\nHence, we get for neutrality the value 0 .\nFor paraconsistent fuzzy information where 1 , the\nindex of contradiction can be defined:\n1  (1.4)\nand for neutrality it results: 0 .\nFor bifuzzy information that is defined by the pair ),(  ,\nthe net truth, the index of ignorance (incompleteness), index of contradiction and index of ambiguity can be defined, by:\n  (1.5)\n)1,min(1   (1.6)\n1)1,max(   (1.7)\n|1|||1   (1.8)\nAmong of these information parameters the most important is the construction of some measures for information entropy or information uncertainty.
