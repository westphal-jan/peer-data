So, dialogue language understanding is growing and considering the important issues today for facilitating the process of dialogue acts classification; consequently segment the long dialogue turn into meaningful units namely utterances are increasing.\nThis paper refers to an utterance as a small unit of speech that corresponds to a single act[1,2]. In speech research community, utterance definition is a slightly different; it refers to a complete unit of speech bounded by the speaker's silence while, we refer to the complete unit of speech as a turn. Thus, a single turn can be composed of many utterances. Turn and utterance can be the same definition when the turn contains one utterance as defined and used in [3] .\nOur main motivation for the work reported here comes from automatic understanding Egyptian dialogues and IM which called \u201cdialogue acts classification\u201d. Dialogue Acts (DA) are labels attached to dialogue utterances to serve briefly characterize a speaker's intention in producing a particular utterance [1].\nEgyptian turns are almost long and contains many utterances as we noticed during data collection. Consequently, we propose a novel approach to turn segmentation into utterances for Egyptian Arabic and Arabic Instant Messages (IM) namely \u201eUSeg\u201f, which has not addressed before to the best of our knowledge.\nUSeg is a machine learning approach based on context without relying on punctuation, text diacritization or lexical cues. Whereas, USeg depends on a set of features from the annotated data that\u201fs include morphological features which have been determined by the Morphological Analysis and Disambiguation of Arabic Tool (MADAMIRA) 1 [4]. USeg is evaluated by an Arabic dialogue corpus contains spoken dialogues and instant messages for Egyptian Arabic, and results are compared with manually segmented turns elaborated by experts.\nThis paper is organized as follows: section 2 present the Egyptian dialect, section 3 present the background, section 4 describe the corpus used to experiment, section 5 present the proposed approach \u201cUSeg\u201d, section 6 present the experimental setup and results; and finally the conclusion and feature works is reported in section 7."}, {"heading": "2. ARABIC LANGUAGE", "text": "Arabic is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. According to Egyptian Demographic Center, it is the mother tongue of about 300 million people (22 countries). There are about 135.6 million Arabic internet users until 2013 2 .\nThe orientation of writing is from right to left and the Arabic alphabet consists of 28 letters. The Arabic alphabet can be extended to ninety elements by writing additional shapes, marks, and vowels. Most Arabic words are morphologically derived from a list of roots that are tri, quad, or pent-literal. Most of these roots are tri-literal. Arabic words are classified into three main parts of speech, namely nouns, including adjectives and adverbs, verbs, and particles. In formal writing, Arabic sentences are often delimited by commas and periods. Arabic language has two main forms: Standard Arabic and Dialectal Arabic. Standard Arabic includes Classical Arabic (CA) and MSA while Dialectal Arabic includes all forms of currently spoken Arabic in daily life, including online social interaction and it vary among countries and deviate from the Standard Arabic to some extent[5]. There are six dominant dialects, namely; Egyptian, Moroccan, Levantine, Iraqi, Gulf, and Yemeni.\nMSA considered as the standard that commonly used in books, newspapers, news broadcast, formal speeches, movies subtitles,\u2026 etc.. Egyptian dialects commonly known as Egyptian colloquial language is the most widely understood Arabic dialects due to a thriving Egyptian television and movie industry, and Egypt\u201fs highly influential role in the region for much of the 20th century[6]. Egyptian dialect has several large regional varieties such as Delta and Upper Egypt, but the standard Egyptian Arabic is based on the dialect of the Egyptian capital which is the most understood by all Egyptians.\n1 http://nlp.ldeo.columbia.edu/madamira/ 2 http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm"}, {"heading": "3. BACKGROUND", "text": ""}, {"heading": "A segmentation process generally means dividing the long unit, namely \u201cturn\u201d into meaningful", "text": "pieces or small units \u201cnon-overlapping units\u201d namely \u201cutterances\u201d. Moreover, we distinguish three main approaches to turn segmentations:\nThe acoustic segmentation approach is usually segmented the long input \u201cwaveform\u201d into short pieces based on acoustic criteria features such as pauses \u201cnon-speech intervals\u201d.\nLinguistic segmentation is segment the turn based on syntactic and semantic features such as morphological features.\nThe mixed approach is used the acoustic and linguistic features.\nDue to the lack of an Egyptian Arabic recognition system, manual transcription of the corpus is then required. Therefore, we focus on linguistic segmentation for Arabic spontaneous dialogues and an IM segmentation task that has several challenges:\nEssential characteristics of spontaneous speech: ellipses, anaphora, hesitations, repetitions, repairs\u2026 etc. These are some examples from our corpus:\no A user who does repairs and apologize in his turn: (Alsfr ywm 12 dysmbr Asfh 11 dysmbr, the arrival on 12 sorry 11 December) 3 . o A user who repeats the negative answer and produce non-necessary information on his turn: ( lA lA\nAnA m$ fAtHp HsAb Endkm wAnA mb$tgls bs jwzy hw Ally by$tgl, No No I don't have an account in your bank and I\u201fm not an employee but my husband is an employee)\nCode Switching: using a dialect words which are derived from foreign languages by code switching between Arabic and other language such as English, France, or Germany. Here an example for user who uses foreign \u201cEgnlish\u201d words in his turn such as (trAnzAk$n, Transaction) and (Aktf, Active) in his turn.\n(Ammm fdh mtAH wlA lAzm mn AlAwl AEml Ay\ntrAnzAk$n El$An ybqy Aktf bdl dwrmnt, Um this is available or I need to do any transaction to activate the dormant account)\nDeviation: Dialect Arabic words may be having some deviation such as MSA \u201c \u201d (Aryd, want) can be \u201c \u201d (EAyz, want), or \u201c \u201d (EAwz, want) in Egyptian dialect.\nAmbiguity: Arabic word may be having different means such as the word \u201c \u201d can be: \u201c \u201d \u201cflag\u201d, \u201c \u201d \u201cscience\u201d, \u201d \u201cit was known\u201d, \u201d \u201che knew\u201d, \u201c \u201c \u201che taught\u201d or \u201c \u201d \u201che was taught\u201d. Thus, the ambiguity considers the key problem for Natural\n3 Examples are written as Arabic (Buckwalter transliteration schema, English translation)\nLanguage Understanding / Processing especially on the Arabic language. The word diacritization is very useful to clarify the meaning of words and disambiguate any vague spellings.\nLack of Resources: The not existence and the lack of tagged Arabic Spontaneous Dialogues and Instance Messages corpora for Egyptian Arabic corpus make turn segmentation task far more challenging. Since manual construction of tagged corpus is time-consuming and expensive [25], it is difficult to build large tagged corpus for Arabic dialogues acts and turn segmentation. So, the researchers had to build their own resources for testing their approaches. Consequently, we built our corpus and used it for both training and testing (see section 4).\nThe most of turn segmentation into utterances approaches such as[7-10] are developed and tested on non-Arabic languages such as English, Germany or France. There are few works interested in Arabic dialogue acts classification; these works have defined and used the user\u201fs turn as an utterance without any segmentation such as [3,11-15]. However, there are some approaches used for Arabic text segmentation based on linguistic approaches either rule-based such as [16-18] or machine learning based such as [19]. These approaches mainly rely on punctuation indicators/marks, conjunctions, text diacritization or/and lexical cues. In addition, it is designed and applied on MSA text such as newspapers and books, which are completely different from Arabic spontaneous dialogues and IM, which are considered an informal [20]."}, {"heading": "4. CORPUS CONSTRUCTION", "text": "We built our own corpus namely JANA, which has manually dialogues turns segmented into utterances and annotated with dialogue acts schema. JANA is a multi-genre corpus of Arabic dialogues labeled for Arabic Dialogues Language Understanding (ADLU) at utterance level ant it comprises spontaneous dialogues and IM for Egyptian dialect. Building JANA corpus proceeds in three stages:\n1. In the first stage, we collected/recorded 200 dialogues manually from different genre call centers such as Banks, Flights, Mobile Network Providers (MNP), and MNP\u201fs online-\nsupport using Egyptian native speakers since August 2013; these dialogues consist of human-human conversation and instant messages about inquiries regarding providing service from call centers such as create a new bank account, service request, balance check and flight reservation.\n2. In the second stage, we are randomly choice 52 spoken dialogues from recorded dialogues and 30 IM dialogues as the first release of JANA corpus. The selected phone\ncalls of spoken dialogues are recorded manually with an average duration of two hours of talking time after removing ads and waiting times from phone calls. Moreover, these phone calls are transcribed using Transcriber 4 toolkit.\n3. In the third stage, turns are segmented into utterances manually and the utterances are tagged with DAs labels which reported by [21] manually.\n4 Available at http://trans.sourceforge.net/en/presentation.php\nThe first release of JANA consists of approximately 3001 turns with average 6.7 words per turn, contains 4725 utterances with average 4.3 words per utterance, and 20311 words; and it will be made freely available to academic and nonprofit research. Moreover, the most important characteristics of JANA corpus are shown in Table 1 and a sample of turn\u201fs segmentation and utterance\u201fs DAs annotation is shown in Table 2.

Moreover, the SVM is robust to noise and the ability to deal with a large number of features effectively [24]. The SVM classifier is trained to discriminate between\nexamples of each class, and those belonging to all other classes combined. During testing, the classifier scores on an example, are combined to predict its class label [25].\nUSeg is a SVM approach which a Machine learning based involve a selected set of features, extracted from segmented and annotated datasets, which is used to generate a statistical model for segmentation prediction. We used YamCha SVM toolkit 5 that converts the text segmentation task to a text chunking task.\nThere are three processes to do as preprocessing the input turns before running the USeg classifier. These processes are:\n1. Normalization: to avoid writing errors from the transcription, we normalized the transcribed turns (unified Arabic characters) as\na. Convert Hamza-under-Alif \u201c \u201d, Hamza-over-Alif \u201c \u201d, and Madda-over-Alif \u201c \u201d to Alif \u201c \u201d b. Convert Teh-Marbuta \u201c \u201d to Heh \u201c \u201d c. Convert Alif-Maksura \u201c \u201d to Yeh \u201c \u201d.\n2. Split \u201c \u201d (w, and) from the original words: Sometimes the writers write the conjunction \u201c \u201d (w, and) concatenated to the next word. For instant, \u201c \u201d (wqAl, and he talked) the\noriginal word \u201c \u201d (qAl, he talked) is concatenated with the conjunction \u201c \u201d (w, and). To detect and split this \u201c \u201d (w, and) from the original words; we build a tool, namely Wawanizer, which is a lookup-table based classifier contains approximately 22K normalized word extracted from news articles and tweets (113,969 Arabic words).\n3. The turns are transliterated from Arabic to Latin based ASCII characters using the Buckwalter transliteration scheme 6 .\nThere are two phases has employed for carrying out the classification task in our approach, training phase and test phase. The training phase generates the classification model using a set of classification features. In the test phase, the classification model is utilized to predict a class for each token (word).\nIn the training phase, each word is represented by a set of features and its actual segmentation state (either \u201cB-Seg\u201d to indicate that word is a segment/utterance start or \u201cI-Seg\u201d to indicate that word is inside the segment/utterance) in order to produce an SVM model that\u201fs able to predict the start of a segment / utterance. Thus, the first step in our approach is to extract the significant features from the training data. Consequently, we study the impact of the features individually by using only one feature at a time and measure the classifier\u201fs performance using the F-measure metric. Finally, according to the performance achieved, we select the optimized features for the proposed approach \u201cUSeg\u201d.\n5 Available at http://chasen.org/~taku/software/yamcha/ 6 http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/ldc/morph/buckwalter.html"}, {"heading": "5.1. Features Selection", "text": "Feature selection refers to the task of identifying a useful subset of features chosen to represent elements of a larger set.\nContextual word: The features of a sliding window, including a word n-gram that includes the candidate word, along with previous and following words. For instance, in the training corpus the word \u201c \u201d (EAyz, want) appears frequently before a user\u201fs request that indicate a request act or new segment/utterance. Therefore, the classifier will use this information to predict a new segment/utterance after this word.\nPart-Of-Speech (POS): A value indicating the POS tag is a conjunction, noun, or proper noun such as:\no Conjunctions: For instance, in the training corpus the conjunction \u201c \u201d (lkn, but) appears frequently before a user\u201fs request that indicate a new segment/utterance. Also, the conjunction \u201c \u201d (w, and) is considered as anomaly, that can define a new segment/utterance or not, the classifier handles this problem using sliding window from conjunction along with previous and following words. For instance, \u201c\n\u201d (EAy AErf AzAY AftH HsAb w Ayh\nAl<jrA'At AllAzmp lEml dh, I want to open an account and what is required steps). In this example conjunction \u201c \u201d (w, and) separate between two segments/utterances, but here \u201c \u201d (Ayh Alfrq byn AlHsAb AljAry w Altwfyr, what is the difference between current and saving accounts) the conjunction \u201c \u201d (w, and) not considered a segment/utterances separator.\no Noun or Proper noun: a binary value defines the word/token is a noun or proper noun. For instance, in the training corpus the service operator introduces himself and his organization comes directly after greeting such as (msA' Alxyr Al>hly fwn >Hmd sAmy, Good evening Al-Ahly Phone Ahmed Samy ). So, we need to segment this turn into two utterance one includes greeting and the other includes self-introduce.\nPrevious Predicted tags: The previous words tags of turn can help to can help to anticipate the next the candidate/current word tag. So, we adjust that the SVM predict the tag of the current word using the features and previous predicted tags. The SVM tags can be B-Seg or I-Seg (begin of segment/utterance or inside the segment/utterance). For instance, in the training corpus the word \u201c \u201d (EAyz, want) is frequently indicating to new segment/utterance. Sometimes can appears after pronouns that\u201fs means the start of the segment/utterance beginning from the pronoun, not from the word \u201c \u201d (EAyz, want) such as \u201c \u201d (AnA knt EAyz A$trk fy AlAntrnt Albnky, I want to register for internet banking )."}, {"heading": "6. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS", "text": "In order to measure the effect of complexity of each dialogues domain (Banks, Flights, and Mobile Network Operators) on classification accuracy, we experiment on each dialogue domain separately and one experiment to overall combined data. We split each domain based on dialogue turn boundary into 70% training dataset, 20% development dataset (DEV), and the 10 % test dataset as shown in Table 4. The results are reported using standard metrics of Accuracy (Acc), Precision (P), Recall (R), and the F1 score (F1) 7 .\nIn the training stage, the training is applied on the training dataset using selected features set and the results are analyzed to determine the best features set. The development stage is performed using the DEV dataset to define the best feature set which used in the test stage. In the test stage, the classifier is applied on the test dataset and the results are reported and discussed.\nThe selected features are tested on window size within ranges from -1/+1 to -5/+5. We found that a context size of -2/+2 (two previous word and two subsequent word) with three of previous predicted tags achieves the best performance in this task.\nTable shows the results for each domain (Banks, Flights, and Mobile Networks Operators). These results and the overall experiment shows that USeg classifier yield high performance and efficiency in Arabic dialect dialogue turn segmentation into utterances task.\n7 F1\nIn this work, we reported some difficulties that we faced.\nThe (f, Fa) and (b, Ba) conjunctions are considered as the most complex type of conjunctions that cannot detected by any POS tagger such as (bHAwl, I\u201fm trying) consist of (b, Ba) + (HAwl, trying)\nIn IM, sometimes the writers write the Arabic word in Franco-Arabic style. For instance, the word \u201cA7med\u201d express the person's name Ahmed and \u201c3ayz\u201d express a dialect word \u201c \u201d (EAyz, want)."}, {"heading": "7.
