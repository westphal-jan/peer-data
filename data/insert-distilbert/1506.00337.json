Roughly speaking, a qualitative calculus M is simply a finite class of relations over a universe U of spatial or temporal entities which form a Boolean algebra. Usually, we assume that the identity relation is contained in one atomic relation in M and relations in M are closed under converse [19]. Well-known qualitative calculi include Point Algebra (PA) [28,26] and Interval Algebra (IA) [1] for representing temporal relations and Region Connection Calculus RCC5 and RCC8 [22], Cardinal Relation Algebra [12,18], and Rectangle Algebra [14,3] for representing spatial relations.\nFor convenience, we write RCC5/8 for either RCC5 or RCC8.

Unlike RCC5/8, the calculi PA, IA, CRA and RA are closed under composition and are all relation algebras. With weak composition, RCC5/8 is also a relation algebra.\nUsing a qualitative calculus M, we represent spatial or temporal information in terms of relations inM, and formulate a spatial or temporal problem as a set of qualitative constraints (called a qualitative constraint network or QCN). A qualitative constraint has the form (xRy), which specifies that two variables x, y are related by the relation R inM. A QCN N is consistent if there exists an assignment of values in U to variables in N such that all constraints in N are satisfied simultaneously. If this is the case, we call this assignment a solution of N . We say M is minimal if, for each constraint (xRy) in N , R is the minimal (or strongest) relation between x and y that is entailed by N . We say N is globally consistent if every partial solution (i.e. a partial assignment that satisfies all constraints in a restriction of N ) can be extended to a solution of N .\nThe consistency problem and the minimal labelling problem (MLP) are two major reasoning tasks of QSTR research. The consistency problem decides whether a QCN has a solution and the MLP decides if it is minimal. These problems have been investigated in depth in the past three decades for many qualitative calculi in the literature, see e.g. [1,2,3,5,15,18,21,23,26].\nBoth problems are in general NP-hard for IA, CRA, RCC5/8, and RA. Local consistency algorithms like path consistency algorithm (PCA) are designed for solving these problems approximately [1]. A QCN N = {viRijvj : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n} is path consistent (PC) if each Rij is non-empty and contained in the (weak) composition of Rik and Rkj for any k. Applying PCA will either find an inconsistency in N in case N is not path consistent, or return a path consistent network that is equivalent to N , which is also known as the algebraic closure or a-closure of N [19]. A QCN N = {viRijvj : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n} is called basic or atomic if every relation Rij is an atomic relation inM.\nInterestingly, for every qualitative calculusMmentioned in this paper and any basic QCNN overM, path consistency ensures consistency, i.e. any path consistent network has a solution. This holds also for any tractable subclass S of M that contains all basic relations and is closed under (weak) composition, intersection, and converse. For example, it was found in [21] that there exists a unique maximal tractable subclass of IA, written as H and called ORD-Horn. It was proved, also in [21], that any path consistent network overH is consistent.\nIn this paper, we study distributive subalgebras of qualitative calculi. We assume M is a qualitative calculus which satisfies the condition that every path consistent basic QCN has a solution. A subalgebra of M is a subclass of M that contains all atomic relations and is closed under (weak) composition, intersection, and converse. A subalgebra S is distributive if (weak) composition distributives over nonempty intersection, i.e. R (S \u2229 T ) = (R S) \u2229 (R T ) and (S \u2229 T ) R = (S R) \u2229 (T R) for any R,S, T \u2208 S with S \u2229 T 6= \u2205.\nAlthough distributive subalgebra is a new concept proposed recently in [9,15], several examples of distributive subalgebras have been studied before. The first such a\nsubalgebra, the subclass of convex IA relations CIA, was found in [17], where Ligozat also proved that path consistent networks over CIA is globally consistent. As every globally consistent network is minimal, this shows that path consistent networks over CIA is also minimal. Later, Chandra and Pujari [5] defined a class of convex RCC8 relations (written D841 in [15] and this paper) and proved that every path consistent network over D841 is minimal. More recently, Amaneddine and Condotta [2] found another subclass of IA, written as SIA, and proved that CIA and SIA are the only maximal subalgebras of IA such that path consistent networks over which are globally consistent. It turns out that these subalgebras are all maximal distributive subalgebras of IA or RCC8 [15].\nThe important concept of distributive subalgebra was also found very useful in identifying a subnetwork that is equivalent to a given one but has no redundant relations. Such a subnetwork is called a prime subnetwork in [9,15]. It was proved there that every constraint network over a distributive subalgebra of RCC5/8 has a unique prime subnetwork, which can be found in cubic time; and, in contrast, it is in general NP-hard to decide if a constraint is non-redundant in an arbitrary RCC5/8 constraint network. The cubic time algorithm for finding the prime subnetwork is very useful in applications such as computing, storing, and compressing the relationships between spatial objects and hence saving space for storage and communication. We refer the reader to [15] for a real-world application example and detailed discussions.\nAs the focus of [9] and [15] is redundancy in RCC5/8 constraint networks, there are several interesting topics left untouched, which are the subject of this paper. We first give a characterisation of distributive subalgebras in terms of intersections of relations and then compute and find all maximal distributive subalgebras for every qualitative calculus mentioned before. Lastly, we establish two nice properties regarding partial path consistency [4] and variable elimination [30] of constraint networks over a distributive subalgebra. These properties will play an important role in efficient reasoning with sparse constraint networks involving a large number of variables.\nThe remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we first give a short introduction of the qualitative calculi mentioned above and recall basic notions including weak composition, path and global consistency. Section 3 then presents a characterisation of distributive subalgebras and Section 4 shows how we compute and find all maximal distributive subalgebras of these calculi. We then prove in Section 5 two important properties of distributive subalgebras that will be used in efficient reasoning with large sparse constraint networks. In Section 6 we discuss the connection between distributive subalgebras and conceptual neighbourhood graphs, and relation with classical CSPs. The last section then concludes the paper."}, {"heading": "2 Qualitative Calculi", "text": "In this section, we first recall the qualitative calculi PA, IA, CRA, RCC5/8, and RA, and then, recall some relevant notions and results of these constraint languages.\nSuppose U is a domain of spatial or temporal entities. Write Rel(U) for the Boolean algebra of binary relations on U . A qualitative calculus [19] M on U is defined as a finite Boolean subalgebra of Rel(U) which has an atom that contains the identity\nrelation idU on U and is closed under converse, i.e., R is inM iff its converse\nR\u22121 = {(a, b) \u2208 U \u00d7 U : (b, a) \u2208 R}\nis inM [19]. A relation \u03b1 in a qualitative calculusM is atomic or basic if it is an atom inM. Note that the set of basic relations of a qualitative calculus is jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint (JEPD). Well-known qualitative calculi include, among others, PA [28,26], IA [1], CRA [12,18], RA [14,3], and RCC5 and RCC8 [22]."}, {"heading": "2.1 Point Algebra and Interval Algebra", "text": "Definition 1 (Point Algebra (PA) [28]).

Let U be the set of closed intervals on the real line. Thirteen binary relations between two intervals x = [x\u2212, x+] and y = [y\u2212, y+] are defined by the order of the four endpoints of x and y, see Table 1. The Interval Algebra is generated by these JEPD relations.\nWe write\nBIA = {b,m,o, s,d, f,eq, fi,di, si,oi,mi,bi} (1)\nfor the set of basic IA relations. Ligozat [17] defines the dimension of a basic interval relation as 2 minus the number of equalities appearing in the definition of the relation (see Table 1). That is, for basic relations we have\ndim(eq) = 0,dim(m) = dim(s) = dim(f) = 1,dim(b) = dim(o) = dim(d) = 2.\nFor a non-basic relation R we define\ndim(R) = max{dim(\u03b8) : \u03b8 is a basic relation in R}. (2)\nUsing the conceptual neighbourhood graph (CNG) of IA [13], Ligozat [17] gives a geometrical characterisation for ORD-Horn relations. Consider the CNG of IA (shown in Table 1 (ii)) as a partially ordered set (Bint, ) (by interpreting any relation to be smaller than its right or upper neighbours). For \u03b81, \u03b82 \u2208 Bint with \u03b81 \u03b82, we write [\u03b81, \u03b82] as the set of basic interval relations \u03b8 such that \u03b81 \u03b8 \u03b82, and call such a relation a convex interval relation. An IA relation R is called pre-convex if it can be obtained from a convex relation by removing one or more basic relations with dimension lower than R. For example, [o,eq] = {o, s, fi,eq} is a convex relation and {o,eq} is a pre-convex relation. Ligozat has shown that ORD-Horn relations are precisely preconvex relations. Every path consistent network over H is consistent [21].

We assume an orthogonal basis in the Euclidean plane. For a bounded region a, its minimum bounding rectangle (MBR), denoted by M(a), is the smallest rectangle which contains a and whose sides are parallel to the axes of the basis. We write Ix(a) and Iy(a) as, respectively, the x- and y-projections ofM(a). The basic rectangle relation between two bounded regions a, b is \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b2 iff (Ix(a), Ix(b)) \u2208 \u03b1 and (Iy(a), Iy(b)) \u2208 \u03b2, where \u03b1, \u03b2 are two basic IA relations (see Figure 4 for illustration).

The Rectangle Algebra (RA) is the algebra generated by relations in BRA [3].\nHenceforth, for two IA relations R,S, we will write R \u2297 S for the (non-basic) relation {\u03b1 \u2297 \u03b2 : \u03b1 \u2208 R, \u03b2 \u2208 S, \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 B}; analogously, for two subclasses of IA relations R and S, we will write R \u2297 S for the set of RA relations {R \u2297 S : R \u2208 R, S \u2208 S}. The following lemma is straightforward.\nLemma 1. Let \u2206 = {vi(Rij \u2297 Sij)vj}ni,j=1 be an RA network, where Rij and Sij are arbitrary IA relations.

Suppose \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are three basic RCC5/8 relations. Then we have\n\u03b3 \u2208 \u03b1 \u03b2 \u21d4 \u03b3 \u2229 (\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b2) 6= \u2205.

For M being PA, IA, CRA or RA, weak composition is the same as composition, i.e. for any R,S \u2208M, we have R \u25e6 S = R S.\nProposition 2 (See [10]). With the weak composition operation , the converse operation \u22121, and the identity relation, PA, IA, RCC5/8, CRA, and RA are relation algebras. In particular, the weak composition operation is associative. Moreover, for PA, IA, RCC5/8, CRA, and RA relations R,S, T , we have the following cycle law\n(R S) \u2229 T 6= \u2205\u21d4 (R\u22121 T ) \u2229 S 6= \u2205\u21d4 (T S\u22121) \u2229R 6= \u2205.

A cubic time algorithm, henceforth called the path consistency algorithm or PCA, has been devised to enforce path consistency. For any qualitative constraint network N , the PCA either detects inconsistency of N or returns a path consistent network, written Np, which is equivalent to N and also known as the algebraic closure or a-closure of N [19]. It is easy to see that in this case Np refines N , i.e., we have Sij \u2286 Rij for each constraint (viSijvj) in Np.\nDefinition 5. LetM be a qualitative calculus with universe U . SupposeN = {viTijvj : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n} is a QCN over M and V = {v1, ..., vn}. For a pair of variables vi, vj \u2208 V (i 6= j) and a basic relation \u03b1 in Tij , we say \u03b1 is feasible if there exists a solution (a1, a2, . . . , an) in U of N such that (ai, aj) is an instance of \u03b1. We say N is minimal if \u03b1 is feasible for every pair of variables vi, vj (i 6= j) and every basic relation \u03b1 in Tij .\nA scenario of N is a basic network with form \u0398 = {vi\u03b8ijvj : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n}, where each \u03b8ij is a basic relation in Tij .

We then verify the following three facts:\nTable 3: The closure of basic IA relations, BIA, contains 29 non-empty relations. eq d oi f fi d o s f d di o oi s si f fi eq f fi eq bi si bi oi mi s bi di oi mi si s si eq bi d oi mi f mi bi d di o oi mi s si f fi eq m b oi b o m o b di o m fi di b d o m s di oi si b d di o oi m s si f fi eq di o fi b bi d di o oi m mi s si f fi eq\nd\nTable 4: Additional relations contained in CIA. fi eq di fi d di o oi mi s si f fi eq f eq di si d di o oi m s si f fi eq si eq di si fi eq d di o oi m mi s si f fi eq s eq di oi si f fi eq bi mi oi f di oi mi si bi oi mi f oi si di oi mi si f fi eq bi oi mi si oi si f eq di o s si fi eq bi oi mi si f eq oi mi di o m fi bi di oi mi si f fi eq oi mi f di o m s si fi eq bi d oi mi s si f eq oi mi si d f bi d di o oi m mi s si f fi eq oi mi si f eq d s b m o fi d s f eq b o m fi o s d oi s si f eq b o m s o s fi eq d oi mi f b o m s fi eq o m d oi mi s si f eq b di o m s si fi eq o m fi d o s f fi eq b d o m s f fi eq o m s d o m s b d di o oi m mi s si f fi eq o m s fi eq d o m s f fi eq\nBased upon the above facts, we show that the four candidate subalgebras are the only maximal distributive subalgebras of CRA.\nTo prove the maximality, suppose S is one of the four candidate subalgebras. Let R be a relation in CRA which is not in S. Then \u0302S \u222a {R} is not distributive. This is because, by the above facts either \u0302\u0302B \u222a {R} is not distributive or \u0302\u0302B \u222a {R} is one of the 8 subalgebras and \u0302B\u0302 \u222a {R} \u222a S is not distributive.\nTo prove there are no other maximal distributive subalgebras, suppose S \u2032 is a distributive subalgebra that is not a subset of any of the four candidate subalgebras. S \u2032 must contain at least two relations in D, say R1 and R2. By the above facts, we know the closure of the union of \u0302B\u0302 \u222a {R1} and \u0302B\u0302 \u222a {R2} is either not distributive or one of the four maximal distributive subalgebra. If it is the latter case, then S \u2032 would be either not distributive or a superset of one of the four maximal distributive subalgebras. Note that the latter situation cannot happen as it contradicts the maximality of the four maximal distributive subalgebras.\nInterestingly, these four maximal distributive subalgebras of CRA correspond exactly to the Cartesian products of the maximal distributive subalgebras of PA, viz.\nCPA \u2297CPA, CPA \u2297SPA,SPA \u2297CPA,SPA \u2297SPA, where we interpret in a natural way a CRA relation e.g. {NW,N} as {<,=} \u2297 {>}."}, {"heading": "4.3 Maximal Distributive Subalgebras of RA", "text": "Unlike the other small calculi we have discussed, RA has a large number (169) of basic relations, resulting a total of 2169 relations in it. It becomes infeasible to exploit the former brute-force procedure to compute the maximal distributive subalgebras of RA. However, noting that the maximal distributive subalgebras of CRA are exactly the Cartesian products of the two maximal distributive subalgebras of PA, we conjecture that a similar situation happens to RA. This is indeed true.\nTheorem 3. RA has exactly four maximal distributive subalgebras, which are the Cartesian products of the two maximal distributive subalgebras of IA.\nProof. For convenience, we write D1 and D2 for the maximal distributive subalgebras CIA and SIA. It is straightforward to show that their Cartesian products Di \u2297 Dj (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 2) are all distributive subalgebras of RA.\nIn order to show the maximality of Di \u2297 Dj , suppose R 6\u2208 Di \u2297 Dj . We show that the subalgebra \u0302{R} \u222a Di \u2297Dj is not distributive. Let Rx = {\u03b1 \u2208 BIA | \u2203\u03b2 \u2208 BIA s.t. (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 R} and define Ry similarly. Note that R is always contained in Rx \u2297 Ry . There are two cases.\nCase 1.R ( Rx\u2297Ry . Then there exist \u03b10 \u2208 Rx and \u03b20 \u2208 Ry s.t. \u03b10\u2297\u03b20 6\u2208 R. Let S = {\u03b10}\u2297 ? and T = ?\u2297{\u03b20}. Note that B\u0302RA is strictly contained in Di\u2297Dj . Thus S, T \u2208 \u0302{R} \u222a Di \u2297Dj . It is easy to see that R \u2229 S 6= \u2205, R \u2229 T 6= \u2205, and S \u2229 T 6= \u2205, but R\u2229S \u2229T = \u2205. By Theorem 1, this implies that \u0302{R} \u222a Di \u2297Dj is not distributive.\nCase 2. R = Rx \u2297 Ry . Then we have either Rx 6\u2208 Di or Ry 6\u2208 Dj . Take Rx 6\u2208 Di as an example. Then \u0302{Rx} \u222a Di is not distributive. This implies that there exist R0, S0, T0 \u2208 \u0302{Rx} \u222a Di which do not satisfy Helly\u2019s condition (8). Note that R0 \u2297 ?, S0\u2297?, and T0\u2297? are all in \u0302{R} \u222a Di \u2297Dj . However, the three relationsR0\u2297?, S0\u2297?, and T0 \u2297 ? do not satisfy (8), which means that \u0302{R} \u222a Di \u2297Dj is not distributive.\nThe above proves the maximality of Di \u2297 Dj . To show the uniqueness, suppose S is a distributive subalgebra. We show S is a subset of Di \u2297Dj for some i, j.\nFirst, we show for every R \u2208 S we have R = Rx \u2297 Ry . Suppose not. Then there exist \u03b1 \u2208 Rx and \u03b2 \u2208 Ry s.t. \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b2 6\u2208 R. Similar to the proof of the maximality, we know both {\u03b1} \u2297 ? and ? \u2297 {\u03b2} are in B\u0302 and, hence, in S . The three relations R, {\u03b1} \u2297 ?, ?\u2297 {\u03b2}, however, do not satisfy Helly\u2019s condition (8).\nNext, we show that S is a subset of Di \u2297 Dj for some i, j. Write Sx = {Rx : R \u2208 S} and Sy = {Ry : R \u2208 S}. We assert that Sx and Sy are both distributive subalgebras of IA. We first note that if R = Rx \u2297 Ry \u2208 S, then both Rx \u2297 ? and ? \u2297 Ry are in S. This is because, for instance, {eq} \u2297 ? is a relation in B\u0302RA \u2286 S and (Rx\u2297Ry) ({eq}\u2297?) = Rx\u2297?. It is easy to check that {Rx\u2297? : Rx\u2297Ry \u2208 S} is a distributive subalgebra which is contained in S. Now, it is clear that Sx is a distributive subalgebra of IA and, hence, contained in eitherD1 orD2. The same conclusion applies to Sy . Therefore, S is a subset of Di \u2297Dj for some i, j. ut\nThe above proof also applies to CRA."}, {"heading": "5 Partial Path Consistency and Variable Elimination", "text": "In this section, we present two nice properties of distributive subalgebras, which will play an important role in reasoning with large sparse constraint networks."}, {"heading": "5.1 Variable Elimination", "text": "In [30], Zhang and Marisetti proposed a novel variable elimination method for solving (classical and finite) connected row convex (CRC) constraints [8]. The idea is to eliminate the variables one by one until a trivial problem is reached. Although very simple, the algorithm is able to make use of the sparsity of the problem instances and performs very well. One key property of CRC constraints is that any strong path consistent CRC constraint network is globally consistent. Recall that a similar property has been identified in our Theorem 2 for constraint networks over a distributive subalgebra. The following theorem shows that the same variable elimination method also applies to constraint networks over a distributive subalgebra,\nTheorem 4. LetM be a qualitative calculus that satisfies (6) and (7). Suppose N = {viRijvj | 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n} is a network over a distributive subalgebra S of M and V = {v1, ..., vn}. If Rij \u2286 Rin Rnj for every 1 \u2264 i, j < n, then N\u2212n is consistent only if N is consistent, where N\u2212n is the restriction of N to {v1, ..., vn\u22121}.\nProof. Suppose {\u03b4ij : 1 \u2264 i, j < n} is a consistent scenario ofN\u2212n. First, write Ti for Rn,i and let T\u0302i = \u22c2n\u22121 j=1 Tj \u03b4ji.

At each step, we choose the node for deleting which has the smallest degree. In particular, we can simply remove all nodes with degree 1 from the constraint network without affecting its consistency. This is especially useful for efficient reasoning with large sparse constraint networks."}, {"heading": "5.2 Partial Path Consistency", "text": "Another efficient method for solving sparse constraint networks is the partial path consistency (PPC) algorithm proposed by Bliek and Sam-Haroud [4]. The idea is to enforce path consistency (PC) on sparse graphs by triangulating instead of completing them. The authors demonstrated that, as far as CRC constraints are concerned, the pruning capacity of PC on triangulated graphs and their completion are identical on the common edges. Recently, PPC has also been extended to qualitative spatial and temporal constraint solving [6,23], where the authors proved that any PPC constraint network over a maximal tractable subclass of IA or RCC8 is always consistent. However, for constraint networks over these subclasses, the pruning capacity of PC on triangulated graphs and their completion may be not identical on the common edges. In this section, we show that the answer is affirmative for constraint networks over distributive subalgebras.\nWe first recall several basic notions related to PPC introduced in [4]. An undirected graph G = (V,E) is triangulated or chordal if every cycle of length greater than 3 has a chord, i.e. an edge connecting two non-consecutive vertices of the cycle. For each v \u2208 V , the adjacency set Adj(v), is defined as {w \u2208 V : {v, w} \u2208 E}. A vertex v is simplicial ifAdj(v) is complete. Every chordal graph has a simplicial vertex. Moreover, after removing a simplicial vertex and its incident edges from the graph, a chordal graph remains chordal. The order in which simplicial vertices are successively removed is called a perfect elimination order.\nLemma 3 ([4]). If G = (V,E) is an incomplete chordal graph, then one can add a missing edge (u,w) with u,w \u2208 V such that\n\u2013 the graph G\u2032 = (V,E \u222a {{u,w}}) is chordal graph; and \u2013 the graph induced by X = {x|{u, x}, {x,w} \u2208 E} is complete.\nFor a constraint network N = {viRijvj : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n} over V = {v1, ..., vn}, the constraint graph of N is the undirected graph G(N ) = (V,E(N )), for which we have {vi, vj} \u2208 E(N ) iff Rij 6= ?. Given a constraint network N and a graph G = (V,E), we say N is partial path consistent w.r.t. G iff for any 1 \u2264 i, j, k \u2264 n with {vi, vj}, {vj , vk}, {vi, vk} \u2208 E we have Rik \u2286 Rij Rjk [6].\nThe following result was first proved for RCC8 in [24]. The proof given there is also applicable to other calculi. We here give a slightly different proof which does not use the weakly global consistency result.\nTheorem 5. LetM be a qualitative calculus that satisfies (6) and (7). Suppose N = {viRijvj | 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n} is a network over a distributive subalgebra S of M and V = {v1, ..., vn}. Assume in addition that G = (V,E) is a chordal graph such that E(N ) \u2286 E. Then enforcing partial path consistency on G is equivalent to enforcing path consistency on the completion of G, in the sense that the relations computed for the constraints in G are identical.\nProof. The proof is similar to the one given for CRC constraints [4, Theorem 3]. Suppose we have a chordal graph G = (V,E) such that G(N ) \u2286 G andN is PPC w.r.t. G. We will add to G the missing edges one by one until the graph is complete. To prove\nthe theorem, we show that the relations of the constraints can be computed from the existing ones so that each intermediate graph, including the complete graph, is path consistent.\nIn the following we assume the order v1, . . . , vn is a perfect elimination order of chordal graph G. Denote Si = {vn\u2212i+1, . . . , vn}, Gi = G(Si) (the induced subgraph of G by Si), and Fi = {vk \u2208 N(vn\u2212i) : k > n \u2212 i}, where N(vn\u2212i) = {vj : {vj , vn\u2212i} \u2208 E}.\nWe add the missing edges one by one to G in the following manner:\n1. choose the largest i such that Gi is complete; 2. choose vertices vn\u2212i, vj in G; 3. label the edge {vn\u2212i, vj} (and resp. its reverse) with\nRn\u2212i,j = \u22c2\nvk\u2208Fi\nRn\u2212i,k Rk,j .\nAfter adding one edge, we prove G\u2032, the resulting graph, is still path consistent. First, we show the added label is non-empty. To show this, by Theorem 1, we need only showRn\u2212i,k Rk,j \u2229Rn\u2212i,k\u2032 Rk\u2032,j 6= \u2205 for any vk 6= vk\u2032 \u2208 Fi. Such a pairwise intersection is not empty because, by the cycle law of relation algebra, we have\nRn\u2212i,k Rk,j \u2229Rn\u2212i,k\u2032 Rk\u2032,j 6= \u2205 iff Rk,n\u2212i Rn\u2212i,k\u2032 \u2229Rk,j Rj,k\u2032 6= \u2205.\nSince G(Fi \u222a {vn\u2212i}) and Gi are complete and path consistent, we have Rk,k\u2032 \u2286 Rk,n\u2212i Rn\u2212i,k\u2032 andRk,k\u2032 \u2286 Rk,j Rj,k\u2032 . This showsRk,n\u2212i Rn\u2212i,k\u2032\u2229Rk,j Rj,k\u2032 6= \u2205 and, hence, Rn\u2212i,k Rk,j \u2229Rn\u2212i,k\u2032 Rk\u2032,j 6= \u2205.\nWe then need to show the constraint network is path consistent for the three paths \u3008n\u2212 i, j, k\u2032\u3009, \u3008n\u2212 i, k\u2032, j\u3009, and \u3008k\u2032, n\u2212 i, j\u3009.\nFor \u3008n \u2212 i, j, k\u2032\u3009, note that, for any k \u2208 Fi, we have Rn\u2212i,k\u2032 \u2286 Rn\u2212i,k Rk,k\u2032 \u2286 Rn\u2212i,k Rk,j Rj,k\u2032 . Therefore, we have Rn\u2212i,k\u2032 \u2286 \u22c2 k\u2208Fi Rn\u2212i,k Rk,j Rj,k\u2032 . By\ndistributivity, we know Rn\u2212i,k\u2032 \u2286 ( \u22c2\nk\u2208Fi Rn\u2212i,k Rk,j) Rj,k\u2032 = Rn\u2212i,j Rk,j . For \u3008n\u2212 i, k\u2032, j\u3009, by the construction of Rn\u2212i,j , we have Rn\u2212i,j \u2286 Rn\u2212i,k\u2032 Rk\u2032,j . For \u3008k\u2032, n \u2212 i, j\u3009, we need to show Rk\u2032,j \u2286 Rk\u2032,n\u2212i Rn\u2212i,j . Note Rn\u2212i,j =\u22c2\nvk\u2208Fi Rn\u2212i,k Rk,j . By distributivity, it is sufficient to show, for each k \u2208 Fi, Rk\u2032,j \u2286 Rk\u2032,n\u2212i Rn\u2212i,k Rk,j . Because G(Fi \u222a {vn\u2212i}) is complete and PC, Rk\u2032,k \u2286 Rk\u2032,n\u2212i Rn\u2212i,k. Moreover, because G(Fi \u222a {vj}) is complete and PC by construction and induction, Rk\u2032,j \u2286 Rk\u2032,k Rk,j \u2286 Rk\u2032,n\u2212i Rn\u2212i,k Rk,j .\nThus, after adding a missing edge, the resulting graph remains path-consistent. At last we will get the complete graph, which is equivalent to the completion of G. Note that the label of every edge in G is not changed. This finishes the proof. ut"}, {"heading": "6 Further Discussion", "text": "In this section we discuss the relation of distributive subalgebras with conceptual neighbourhood graphs (CNGs) [13] and star distributivity [20] of classical CSPs."}, {"heading": "6.1 Distributive Subalgebras and Conceptual Neighbourhood Graph", "text": "As we have seen, the classes of convex IA and RCC8 relations are maximal distributive subalgebras of IA and RCC8 respectively.

Like CRA, the CNG of RA is constructed by using the CNG of IA. The subclass of convex RA relations [3] is the maximal distributive subalgebra that is the Cartesian product of CIA and itself.\nFor RCC8, the situation is a little different.

The second concept is very similar to our notion of distributivity, except that it only requires the relations to form a closure w.r.t. the network. A constraint network over a distributive subalgebra is always star-distributive, but it is not clear whether a star-distributive network is always over a distributive subalgebra.\nAs we have seen, relations in a distributive subalgebra exhibit convexity in Helly\u2019s sense.

Extend a consistent scenario \u2206Wk+1t to a consistent scenario \u2206Wk+1t+1 by choos-\ning a certain basic relation \u03b4k+1,t+1 in R\u0302k+1,t+1, together with the constraints {vi\u03b4i,t+1vt+1|1 \u2264 i \u2264 t} in \u2206Vk . See Figure 8 for illustration of \u2206Wk+1t and \u2206Wk+1t+1\n. Step 3. Repeat Step 2 for 1 \u2264 t \u2264 k\u22121 until a consistent scenario\u2206Vk+1 of \u0393\u2193Vk+1 =\n\u0393\u2193Wk+1k is obtained.\nTo show Step 1 can be achieved, we prove that R\u0302k+1,i = \u22c2k\nj=1(Rk+1,j \u03b4j,i) 6= \u2205 for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. By applying the cycle law (see (5)), for 1 \u2264 j, j\u2032 \u2264 k we have\n(Rk+1,j \u03b4ji) \u2229 (Rk+1,j\u2032 \u03b4j\u2032i) 6= \u2205 iff ((Rk+1,j\u2032 \u03b4j\u2032i) \u03b4ij) \u2229Rk+1,j 6= \u2205 iff (Rj\u2032,k+1 Rk+1,j) \u2229 (\u03b4j\u2032i \u03b4ij) 6= \u2205.\nSince \u0393 is path consistent and the partial scenario \u2206Vk is also path consistent, we have \u03b4j\u2032j \u2286 Rj\u2032,j \u2286 Rj\u2032,k+1 Rk+1,j and \u03b4j\u2032j \u2286 \u03b4j\u2032i \u03b4ij . Therefore (Rj\u2032,k+1 Rk+1,j) \u2229 (\u03b4j\u2032i \u03b4ij) 6= \u2205 and hence (Rk+1,j \u03b4ji)\u2229 (Rk+1,j\u2032 \u03b4j\u2032i) 6= \u2205 for any 1 \u2264 j, j\u2032 \u2264 k. Note S is Helly by Proposition 1, we know R\u0302k+1,i = \u22c2k j=1(Rk+1,j \u03b4j,i) 6= \u2205 for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. To show Step 2 can be achieved, we only need to find a basic relation \u03b4k+1,t+1 in R\u0302k+1,t+1 such that\u2206Wk+1t \u222a{vk+1\u03b4k+1,t+1vt+1} is path consistent, for t = 1, . . . , k\u2212 1.\nWith the following statements, we can show the existence of such \u03b4k+1,t+1.\nStatement 1. \u03b4k+1,i \u03b4i,t+1 \u2229 R\u0302k+1,t+1 6= \u2205 for any 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t. Statement 2. \u03b4k+1,i \u03b4i,t+1 \u2229 \u03b4k+1,j \u03b4j,t+1 6= \u2205 for any 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 t.\nIn fact, from the above statements and that S is Helly, we know ( \u22c2t\ni=1(\u03b4k+1,i \u03b4i,t+1))\u2229 R\u0302k+1,t+1 6= \u2205. Thus, there exists a \u03b4k+1,t+1 in R\u0302k+1,t+1 such that\n( t\u22c2 i=1 (\u03b4k+1,i \u03b4i,t+1)) \u2229 \u03b4k+1,t+1 6= \u2205. (13)\nTo show this \u03b4k+1,t+1 actually extends \u2206Wk+1t , we also need to prove that \u2206Wk+1t \u222a {vi\u03b4i,t+1vt+1 : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t} \u222a {vk+1\u03b4k+1,t+1vt+1} is path consistent. Note we only need to show \u03b4k+1,t+1 \u2286 \u03b4k+1,i \u03b4i,t+1 for any 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t, because \u2206Wk+1t and \u2206Vt+1(\u2286 \u2206Vk) are both path consistent. This will be true if (13) is true. Therefore, in the following, we show the two statements above are actually true.\nFor Statement 1, note\n( k\u22c2 j=1 (Rk+1,j \u03b4j,t+1)) \u03b4t+1,i = k\u22c2 j=1 (Rk+1,j \u03b4j,t+1 \u03b4t+1,i)\n\u2287 k\u22c2\nj=1\n(Rk+1,j \u03b4ji).\nThen R\u0302k+1,t+1 \u03b4t+1,i \u2287 R\u0302k+1,i \u2287 \u03b4k+1,i 6= \u2205, that is \u03b4k+1,i \u2229 (R\u0302k+1,t+1 \u03b4t+1,i) 6= \u2205. By cycle law, we have (\u03b4k+1,i \u03b4i,t+1) \u2229 R\u0302k+1,t+1 6= \u2205 for any 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t.\nFor Statement 2, for any 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 t we have\n(\u03b4k+1,i \u03b4i,t+1) \u2229 (\u03b4k+1,j \u03b4j,t+1) 6= \u2205 iff (\u03b4i,k+1 \u03b4k+1,j \u03b4i,t+1) \u2229 \u03b4j,t+1 6= \u2205 iff (\u03b4i,k+1 \u03b4k+1,j) \u2229 (\u03b4i,t+1 \u03b4t+1,j) 6= \u2205.\nBecause \u2206Wk+1t is a (path) consistent scenario, we have \u03b4ij \u2286 \u03b4i,k+1 \u03b4k+1,j for 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 t. Note \u2206Vt+1(\u2286 \u2206Vk) is also a (path) consistent scenario, we have \u03b4ij \u2286 \u03b4i,t+1 \u03b4t+1,j . Then (\u03b4i,k+1 \u03b4k+1,j) \u2229 (\u03b4i,t+1 \u03b4t+1,j) \u2287 \u03b4ij 6= \u2205 for 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 t, and hence (\u03b4k+1,i \u03b4i,t+1) \u2229 (\u03b4k+1,j \u03b4j,t+1) 6= \u2205. ut"}], "references": [{"title": "Maintaining knowledge about temporal intervals", "author": ["James F.

reasoning about qualitative spatial and temporal knowledge. This paper studies distributive subalgebras of qualitative calculi, which are subalgebras in which (weak) composition distributives over nonempty intersections. It has been proven for RCC5 and RCC8 that path consistent constraint network over a distributive subalgebra is always minimal and globally consistent (in the sense of strong n-consistency) in a qualitative sense. The well-known subclass of convex interval relations provides one such an example of distributive subalgebras. This paper first gives a characterisation of distributive subalgebras, which states that the intersection of a set of n \u2265 3 relations in the subalgebra is nonempty if and only if the intersection of every two of these relations is nonempty. We further compute and generate all maximal distributive subalgebras for Point Algebra, Interval Algebra, RCC5 and RCC8, Cardinal Relation Algebra, and Rectangle Algebra. Lastly, we establish two nice properties which will play an important role in efficient reasoning with constraint networks involving a large number of variables.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
