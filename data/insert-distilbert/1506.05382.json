In 2012, the United States and Canada saw a total box office revenues topping $10.8 Billion [16]. In each year, approximately 700 films are released in U.S. and Canada, and the average investment is $65 million per movie [17]. Despite the amount of in-flux capital, the certainty with regard to movie success is largely uncertain, with \u201chits\u201d and \u201cflops\u201d released almost every year. While researchers have undertaken the task of predicting movie success using various approaches, they attempted to predict box office revenues, or theater admissions. However, from an investor\u2019s standpoint, one would want to be as assured as possible that his/her investment will ultimately lead to returns or profits. For instance, \u201cEvan Almighty\u201d earned a high gross revenue of $100 million, but cost $175 million to produce; while \u201cSuper Troopers\u201d cost $3 million, but earned $18.5 million. The latter is certainly a better bet for investors. In fact, among movies produced between 2000 and 2010 in the U.S., only 36% had a box office revenue higher than its production budget, which further highlights the importance of making the right investment decisions. Therefore, our work defines a movie\u2019s success as its profitability and attempts to predict such success in an automated way to better support movie investors\u2019 decisions.\nIn order to support investment decisions on a movie, the prediction of profitability has to be provided at the very early stage of the movie\u2019s production. Consequently, our prediction of movie success can only leverage data that is available when a movie is still being planned. Predictions that are made right before [10] or after [25, 5, 13] the official release may have more data to use and get more accurate results, but they are too late for investors to make any meaningful decision. Building upon our previous work [12], this research proposes a Movie Investor Assurance System (MIAS) to provide early predictions of movie profitability. Based on historical data, the system automatically extracts important characteristics for each movie, including \u201cwho\u201d will be involved in the movie, \u201cwhat\u201d the movie is about, \u201cwhen\u201d the movie will be released, and the match between these features. It then uses various machine\nlearning methods to predict the success of the movie with different criteria for profitability.\nThe overarching research question for this paper is to predict movie profitability using data only available during the pre-production stage of movie development in order to support investment decisions. The main contributions of this research are in 4 areas: First, incorporating machine learning, text mining, and social network analytics, this system represents the first fully automated decision support system that aims at predicting movie profitability, and doing so at the early stage of movie production. Such a system has more practical implications and provides more actionable decision support for investors. Second, our research proposes several novel features, such as dynamic network features, plot topic distributions, the match between \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwho\u201d, and the match between \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d, and shows that these features could contribute to the system\u2019s performance in predicting profitability. Third, our system is the first to retrieve and fuse structured data and unstructured data (e.g., texts in movie plots) from complementary sources for predicting the success of movies. Fourth, although the study is focused on predicting the profitability of movies, our approach can potentially be applied to predicting the success of other creative works.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: after reviewing related research in Section 2, we propose the framework of our system. Section 4 introduces how we extracted different features for the prediction. This is followed by the evaluation of our system using historical data and the analysis of the key factors behind movie success predictions. The paper concludes with discussions of limitations and future research directions."}, {"heading": "2 Related work", "text": "A great amount of research has been done in the area of predicting movie success. In this section, we first examine the way in which success is defined, because it is of paramount importance to the problem. As we mentioned earlier, past works have focused primarily on gross box office revenue [1, 18, 2, 20, 15, 11], while some used the number of admissions [3, 13].\nThe basic assumption for using the two as success metrics is intuitive\u2013a movie that sells well at the box office is considered a success. However, the two metrics ignore how much it costs to produce a movie. In fact, our analysis on historical data also found that revenues are not directly related to profits (more details in Section 5). Thus a more meaningful measure of success should be profitability, whether it is the numeric value of profits [21] or the Return on Investment (ROI) [9].\nAs for prediction methods, many studies categorized movies into two classes based on their revenues (success or not) and adopted binary classifications for predictions; some considered the prediction as a multi-class classification problem and tried to classify movies into several discrete categories, ranging from \u2019blockbuster\u2019 to \u2019flop\u2019 [18]. Meanwhile, there are also predictions on continuous numerical values of success metrics [10, 23, 15], with values of these metrics being logarithmized in several studies [20, 21, 25].\nThe performance of a predictive model depends a lot on the extraction and engineering of features (a.k.a., independent variables). When it comes to predicting movie success, three types of features have been adopted: audience-based, release-based, and movie-based features.\nAudience-based features are about potential audiences\u2019 reception of a movie. The more optimistic, positive, or excited the audiences are about a movie, the more likely it is to have a higher revenue. Similarly, a movie with more pessimistic and negative receptions from the public may attract fewer people to fill seats. Such receptions can be retrieved from different types of media, such as Twitter [2], trailer comments from Youtube [1], blogs [11], new articles [25], and movie reviews [13]. The volume of discussions [2], the sentiment of review or comments [1, 5, 13], as well as the star rating from reviews [6, 20] have been used as a means for assessing audience\u2019s excitement towards a movie.\nRelease-based features focus on the availability of a movie and the time of its release. One such feature that captures availability at release is the number of theaters the movie opens in [25, 19, 20, 18, 15, 23]. The more theaters that will show a movie, the more likely\nthe movie will have a higher revenue. Many movies are targeted for releases at a certain time, or at a time in which they would be eligible to receive an upcoming award. Holiday release is a feature commonly utilized in the prediction problem [11, 20], as are seasons and dates of releases (Spring, Summer, etc.) [11, 18, 6]. Some studies attempted to capture the competition at the time of release [18, 11], which has the potential of negatively effecting revenues.\nMovie-based features are those that are directly related to a movie itself, including who are involved and what the movie is about. For example, one popular feature is a movie\u2019s star power\u2013whether the movie attracts famous actors or directors. Star powers have been captured by actor earnings [18], past award nominations [5], actor rankings [20], and the number of actors\u2019 Twitter followers [1]. The cast has also been explored from a teamwork perspective through the construction of collaboration networks among actors [5, 14, 13]. The idea is that the past experience of and collaborations among actors have an effect and bearing on the performance of a team\u2019s future works [13].\nIn terms of what a movie is about, features such as genre, MPAA rating, whether or not a movie is a sequel, and run time have often been incorporated into success predictions. In addition to these meta data about a movie, to get a better idea of a movie\u2019s content, one needs to examine its plot or script. One study leveraged texts of movie scripts for success predictions [9]. Some of their features are easy to obtain from texts in an automated way, such as number of words, number of characters, number of sentences, and the amount of dialogue present. Nevertheless, more informative textual features in the study depend on manual annotations by human experts, such as the degree to which the story is logical, the degree to which the premise is clear, and the degree to which violence is present. As movie scripts can be very long, such manual annotations can be time-consuming.\nFor our research question of predicting movie profitability at an early stage, we cannot take advantages of most audience-based features and some release-based features, as they would not be available when making investment decisions. For instance, YouTube comments\nonly appear after a movie trailer is released; likewise, the number of theaters a movie is going to be released in will not be known until the end of the movies production. Therefore, we will focus mainly on \u201cWho\u201d features \u2013 who is involved in a movie, \u201cWhen\u201d features \u2013 when a movie will be released, \u201cWhat\u201d features from both meta data and texts of movie plot synopses, as well as the match between \u201cWhat\u201d and \u201cWho\u201d and the match between \u201cWhat\u201d and \u201cWhen\u201d. All the features adopted by our system can be extracted in an automated fashion by using text mining and social network analysis techniques, so that no human intervention is needed."}, {"heading": "3 The system framework", "text": "Figure 1 illustrates the framework of our MIAS. The first phase is data acquisition, because we base our prediction on historical data. While there are various online archives of movie data, we picked two popular and complementary sources \u2013 IMDb and BoxOfficeMojo. IMDb has better coverage of movie plot synopses, while BoxOfficeMojo, as its name suggests, provides more comprehensive data of movie revenues and budgets. In other words, the two data sources can be used jointly for many movies. As for data collection methods, the two sources are different as well. IMDb has a convenient API, from which movie data can be gathered in JSON or XML. The data from BoxOfficeMojo can be only be obtained by the public from its web pages. To get a more comprehensive dataset, our system employs both scripts that interact with APIs and a web scraper to retrieve and parse HTML data from web pages. We believe these two methods should be able to handle data from most open archives on the Internet.\nIn the second phase, data from both sources is cleaned, transformed, consolidated, and stored in a database. During this non-trivial undertaking, we need to make sure that acquired features and texts be put in a consistent format (e.g., stripping of excess characters such as \u201c*\u201d in movie titles), and the data is not duplicated within the database.\nPhase 3, \u201cfeature engineering\u201d, involves utilizing the acquired data to construct features\nthat will ultimately be used to train a predictive model. Categorically, we classify various features into one of four groups \u2013 \u201cwhat\u201d, \u201cwho\u201d, \u201cwhen\u201d, or \u201chybrid\u201d. Features used in this study, and the reasons for including them, will be discussed at length in the next section.\nWith a reasonable and well-rounded set of features in place, a predictive model can be trained in Phase 4 of MIAS. Users of MIAS can employ cross-validation to select optimal parameters (depending upon the model being tested), as well as for selecting the best performing method of prediction, and evaluating general system performance. Section 5 will discuss our experiments in detail.\nTo utilize the predictive model, an investor can take information provided about a potential investment opportunity and feed it into MIAS, which would make a prediction based on historical data as to whether or not it would be profitable."}, {"heading": "4 Feature engineering", "text": "Based on historical data acquired from online archives, we derive novel, as well as previously proven features, for our predictive model. Categorically speaking, these features are primarily from \u201cwho\u201d features, \u201cwhat\u201d features, or \u201cwhen\u201d features. We also introduce our new \u201chybrid\u201d features that match \u201cwho\u201d with \u201cwhat\u201d, as well as \u201cwhat\u201d with \u201cwhen\u201d."}, {"heading": "4.1 \u201cWho\u201d Features", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.1.1 Star Powers", "text": "The very nature of the movie industry is characterized by people who make movies. Successful actors and directors, such as Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and Christopher Nolan, are crowd favorites who are well known throughout the world. Talented individuals such as these can leverage not only their refined industry skills to make high-quality movies, but also the associated \u2019name brand effect\u2019, which draws crowds and increases sales [2, 8, 22]. This effect is typically referred to as \u2018star power\u2019. Our star power features for a movie are as follows:\n1. Tenure of an actor reflects how much experience she/he may have in the industry. It is\ncalculated as the time difference (in years) between the movie in which an actor/actress most recently appeared and that in which he/she first ever appeared. For each movie, we calculate the average and total tenure for its first-billed cast actors/actresses.\n2. Actor Gross is about how much revenue an actor has generated during her/his tenure.\nEach individual\u2019s total gross is the sum of revenues from all the movies that she has starred in, while an individual\u2019s average gross is her total gross divided by the number of movies she starred in. For each movie, we calculate the sum and average of total gross, as well as the average of actor average gross, for all first-billed cast members.\n3. Director Gross measures the past success of directors. We calculate for each director\nthe total and average gross for movies she/he has directed."}, {"heading": "4.1.2 Network-based Features", "text": "Star power features reflect whether a movie\u2019s cast consists of senior and high-revenuegenerating individuals (actors and the director). From a teamwork perspective, the success of the cast as a team also depends on whether individuals in the team can work together and develop \u201cteam chemistry\u201d[13]. It is believed that successful movies have a certain degree of originality to them, in part spurred on by a compelling storyline, but also by the team of actors themselves. To capture these types of team characteristics, we explored the avenue of social networks, which have the potential to yield a wealth of information about inter-personal interactions. Social network analysis has been used to explore topics such as dating [26] and collaboration [27].\nFor our predictive model, we constructed a dynamic collaboration network among actors based on their co-appearances (i.e. co-starring) in previous movies. In such a network, a node represents an actor/actress. For any arbitrary year, an undirected edge was drawn between two actors if they co-starred in a movie during that year. If an edge already existed between the two, indicating that they had collaborated in the past, the edge weight was incremented by 1. Therefore, the aggregated networks for a given year includes all of the earlier years of collaborations, plus those that happen in that year. Fig 2 shows an example network.\nOur network features consist of static features for individuals and dynamic features for network structures. When analyzing the team Tm for movie m in year y, the social network among the movie\u2019s cast members up to year y\u2212 1 was used to extracted the following static features for individuals:\n1. Team Heterogeneity: Some studies have illustrated that a movie benefits from a\ndiverse team, in which actors and actresses have little previous collaboration; each can bring something unique to bear during the production [13]. Thus for each movie, we measured team heterogeneity by examining the network structural similarity between cast members. Specifically, based on each actor\u2019s neighborhood vector in the adjacency\nThe three network features introduced above are based on the static structure of the year y\u2212 1 network before movie m was produced in year y. Once movie m was produced in year y, its cast members formed a new team, which would add edges to the collaboration network\nand change its structure. Our newly developed dynamic network features try to capture the network\u2019s structural changes if the new movie is produced.\n1. Change in clustering coefficient: The clustering coefficient of a node is the\nprobability that the node\u2019s neighbors are also connected to each other. It measures how a node\u2019s neighborhood is \u201cclustered\u201d together. A network\u2019s clustering coefficient is the average of all its nodes\u2019 values on this metric. It has been found that decreasing the clustering co-efficient of a social network can facilitate the diffusion of information across the network [26]. Thus we hypothesized that changes in the clustering coefficient of a collaboration network after forming the team for movie m may be a good indicator of whether or not the movie can bridge sub-communities that are previously not well connected to one another.\n2. Decrease in average shortest path: Structural holes are an important concept\nin network analysis, and networks pertaining to movies are no exception [24]. Some previous studies [5] believe that a movie, which establishes inter-actor links that span structural holes, is more likely to succeed, although they did not quantify the degree to which a movie spans structural holes. The work of [14] used the clustering coefficient for each team member to measure the existence of structural holes. However, clustering coefficient is essentially a node-level metric as it is only based on a node\u2019s direct neighbors in a network. To accurately capture the spanning of structural holes at the network level, we propose to use how the production of a movie m decreases the average shortest path length of the social network, because adding edges that span structural holes usually significantly decreases such path length. Specifically, after adding to Networky\u22121 edges that correspondent to the cast of Tm produced at year y, we calculated how much the average shortest path length of the new network decreased, compared to Networky\u22121. The more such length decreases, the more movie m\u2019s cast can span structural holes in Networky\u22121."}, {"heading": "4.2 \u201cWhat\u201d Features", "text": "In addition to \u201cwho\u201d are in the cast, another natural and important indicator of a movie\u2019s future profitability is what the movie is about. Such information is usually available with high certainty prior to movie funding efforts. To reflect what a movie is about, the \u201cwhat\u201d features in our model include both meta features, such as genre (e.g., action, sci-fi, family) and rating (e.g., PG13, and R), but also fine-grained description of a movie\u2019s content\u2013its plot synopsis.\nIn text mining, texts from plot synopses can be represented as traditional unigrams and bigrams, but such representation will have high dimensionality and, as a result, suffers from sparsity. At a higher level, topic model techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [4], can give a better picture of what a plot is about. The input for LDA is a textual corpus from plot synopses and the output is a group of topics, each being represented by a probabilistic distribution over words. Those words with high probabilities on a topic are considered representative keywords for the topic. Each plot synopsis is also assigned a probabilistic distribution over all the topics. Such topic distribution vector of a movie\u2019s plot reflects the content of the movie at an aggregated level and can be used as features for predictive modeling.\nIn addition to these topics derived from LDA, some movies\u2019 plots are adaptations from other sources, especially when the original sources had achieved certain levels of success. For example, The Hunger Games and Harry Potter are both adapted from best-selling novels. As such, one of our \u201cwhat\u201d features was about adaptations: whether a movie\u2019s plot was adapted from a comic, a true story, or a book/novel."}, {"heading": "4.3 \u201cWhen\u201d Features", "text": "With the movie industry being an avenue for entertainment, its market sees peaks and declines over time, which may speak to how well a pre-production movie may fare in the future. Thus we incorporated the following \u201cwhen\u201d features in our model:\n1. Average Annual Profit: is the average profit across all movies in the year prior to\nthe planned release of movie m. This feature captures the overall profitability of the movie industry before a movie is released.\n2. Release dates: combines several features about when a movie will be released, includ-\ning whether it will be a holiday release and which season of the year (spring, summer, fall, winter). While a holiday or summer release may attract more of an audience and thus generate more revenues [1], it also requires higher budget for marketing and distributions during these competitive periods. Although the exact release date is not completely definitive before filming, a target trajectory usually exists at the early stage of movie production."}, {"heading": "4.4 Hybrid Features", "text": "Besides standalone features about \u201c \u2018who\u201d are in a movie, \u201cwhat\u201d a movie is about, and \u201cwhen\u201d a movie will be released, it is also important to capture the \u201cmatch\u201d between these features. Our hybrid features try to reflect such matches between \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwho\u201d, as well as between \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d. For example, it may be important to form a team of actors based on their previous experience with the genre of the movie being planned, instead of just their star powers. Similarly, the investment on a movie whose genre is gaining popularity may increase the chance of success."}, {"heading": "4.4.1 \u201cWhat\u201d + \u201cWho\u201d", "text": "In observing the movie industry as a whole, and the actors that tell the stories, we can distinguish various so-called \u2018roles\u2019 that these actors seem to adopt. For example, Seth Rogan is typified by his appearance in comedies, and Bruce Willis exhibits a proficiency as an action movie star. Should a movie then, granted this observation, try to include those who have extensive experience in its genre? Does a surprising cast draw a greater audience to\ntheaters (e.g., having Bruce Willis in a comedy or having action star Arnold Schwartzenegger in a romantic love story)?\nTo measure an actor\u2019s previous experience and expertise in movies with different genre we define, for each actor or actress j, a genre experience vector Aj = [aj,1, ..., aj,k, ..., aj,K ], where aj,k is the proportion of the number of times actor/actress j appeared in movies with genre k. A total of K = 26 unique genres are defined.\nSimilarly, a movie m is also represented as a genre vector Gi = [gm,1, ..., gm,k, ..., gm,K ], where gm,k = 1 indicates that movie m has genre k, and gm,k = 0 otherwise. Note that some movies can have more than one genre. For example, the genre of \u2018Spiderman\u2019 is both action and adventure.\nBy measuring the similarity between actors\u2019 genre experience vectors and movies\u2019 genre vectors, we design several features that speak to the genre-based expertise brought by cast members to a given film m\u2019s team Tm.\n1. Average Genre Expertise (AGE): captures the average cast experience with respect\nto the current movie\u2019s genre. Movie m\u2019s AGE is defined in Equation 2.\nAGEm = 1\n|Tm| |Tm|\u2211 j=1 Gm \u2022 Aj (2)\n2. Weighted Average Genre Expertise (WAGE) is an extension of AGE. AGE only\nconsiders the frequency that each actor starred in a genre, while WAGE goes a step further to incorporate an actor\u2019s star power, measured by actor gross, in each genre. As defined in Equation 3, WAGE of movie m is essentially the movie\u2019s AGE weighted by each cast member j\u2019s gross revenue Rj. In other words, a movie with a big star who is familiar with its genre will have high WAGE.\nWAGEm = 1\n|Tm| |Tm|\u2211 j=1 log(Rj) \u2217 (Gm \u2022 Aj) (3)\n3. Cast Novelty is similar to WAGE but focuses on whether a movie has a big star who\nhas rarely appeared in movies of this genre before. It is the maximum value among all actors\u2019 star-power-weighted inverse experience in movie m\u2019s genre (Equation 4).\nCNm = max{ log(Rj)\nGm \u2022 Aj + 1 ,\u2200j \u2208 Tm} (4)"}, {"heading": "4.4.2 \u201cWhat\u201d + \u201cWhen\u201d", "text": "Similar to the overall market volume for movies, which may change from year to year, consumers\u2019 preferences of movies may also evolve with time. For example, while movies like \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d and \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Van Wilder\u201d were popular in the late 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s, movie-goers recently have been flocking to horror movies, such as \u201cParanormal Activity\u201d, and those characterized by superheroes, such as \u201cThe Avengers\u201d and \u201cCaptain America\u201d. Although the latter category is nothing definitively new to the silver screen, the movie industry has seen greater levels of success in recent years with this particular focus and, as such, a greater influx of such movies. Thus, in addition to capturing \u201cwhen\u201d a movie will be released, we also consider how movies with similar genre performed in the previous year with the following features:\n1. Annual Profitability Percentage by Genre is the percentage of profitable movies,\nwhich have the same genre with movie m, in the year prior to the planned release of movie m. This feature reflects the degree of success for movies that share the same genre as the movie being considered.\n2.

While movies in our dataset date back to 1921, we focused our study to movies released during the 11-year period of 2000-2010 (inclusive), because this period is recent enough to reflect the current state of the industry and there has been a sufficient amount of elapsed time since movies\u2019 release for revenue data to be accurately updated.\nAs our goal is to predict movie success measured by profits, our dataset for experiments only included those movies that have both budget and box office revenue data available. We also excluded movies with an \u2018Unknown\u2019 genre, or an \u2018Unknown\u2019 MPAA rating. Movies with \u2018Documentary\u2019 genre were also excluded, as those are typically not released to theaters and may not involve professional actors/actresses. Additionally, any movie designated as being part of a franchise or as a sequel were also excluded (e.g. Iron Man, Iron Man 2, etc.). We made this decision because the success of a sequel depends heavily on the success of earlier movies in the same franchise. Also, the content of a sequel and its selection of cast members are also highly limited by its earlier counterparts. Thus what is behind the success of a sequel may be very different from that of other movies.\nWith all of these considerations in mind, our final dataset for experiments consisted of 2,506 movies. A distribution by genre of these 2,506 movies, relative to all movies released during the period, is related in Figure 3. The distribution suggests that our dataset is a representative sample overall, with the exception of the \u2018Foreign\u2019 genre. This makes sense\nbecause budget and revenue data may be more difficult to obtain for movies that are produced, and in all likelihood, released outside the U.S. Based on the plot synopses of these movies, we used LDA to generate 30 topics. Top keywords of these topics are listed in Table 1.\nWhile the experiment will predict the success of 2,506 movies during a 11-year period, the collaboration network we built for this study incorporates the collaboration between all the actors in all 14,097 movies in our dataset. The initial unweighted, undirected network was aggregated to the year 1999, with networks for subsequent years being updated to reflect that year\u2019s new collaborations. In all, we created 11 snapshots of the collaboration network from 1999 to 2009."}, {"heading": "5.2 The measure of success", "text": "To predict whether a movie is successful, we first need to measure a movie\u2019s profitability. With both revenue and budget data for each movie in our dataset, we can certainly calculate the raw profit value (i.e., revenue-budget) for each movie. The distribution of raw profit values in Figure 4 appears to follow a normal distribution\u2013a large number of movies have nearzero profits. With only 36% of the movies in our dataset having positive profits, investors do need a decision support system to help them pick the right movie to invest in.\nNevertheless, while using profit values is intuitive, gaining a profit of $10,000 from a\nmovie that costs $1 million to produce is certainly not an attractive investment. Thus in our experiments, we adopted a popular metric of profitability\u2013return on investment (ROI) as in [9]. It considers both profit and budget and is defined in Equation 6. The higher the ROI is, the more profitable a movie is, and vice versa.\nROI = Revenue\u2212Budget\nBudget (6)\nInterestingly, the data suggests that profitability, as measured by ROI, is not necessarily reflected by box office revenues. The correlation coefficient between revenues and ROIs is only 0.077. In other words, having a great box office revenue does not necessarily mean a high ROI. This further highlights the need for accurate prediction of profitability."}, {"heading": "5.3 Classification results", "text": "The prediction of a movie\u2019s success is essentially a classification problem, where we classify movies into discrete bins or classes. Then the problem is to decide whether a movies should be considered a success or not based on ROI. Although there is no agreed-upon industry \u2018gold standard\u2019 as to an ideal ROI (other than that \u2018higher is better\u2019), it is reasonable to\nassume that one would like to see some substantive returns from a successful movie, given that millions of dollars are invested with considerable risks. Also, any form of profit is better than a loss. With these in mind, we elected to define the decision boundary between successful and unsuccessful movies in different ways for both binary and multi-class predictions.\nFor both binary and multi-class classification of movie success, we try a variety of algorithms and select the algorithm with the best overall performance based on the following three metrics (all results were obtained using 10-fold cross-validation), where higher values indicate better performance.\n1. The Area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic curve (AUC). The Receiver Op-\nerator Characteristic curve plots the true positive rate (the Y-axis) against the false positive rate (the X-axis). An AUC of 1 means a perfect classification while 0.5 refers to a random guess. Being more robust against prior distributions, AUC is considered by many to be one of the best indicators of a classifier\u2019s performance.\n2. Classification accuracy, which is simply the percentage of correctly predicted instances.\n3. F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\nIn addition to identifying the best performing algorithm, we also evaluate how different groups of features in Section 3 contribute to the prediction of movie success. This is done by removing a group of features from the input to a classifier, and observing how much the classifier\u2019s performance deteriorates as a result. Besides the \u2018Who\u2019, \u2018What\u2019, \u2018When\u2019, and \u2018Hybrid\u2019 features we introduced in Section 3, we also created an arbitary group called \u2018New\u2019 features to include all the novel features we proposed for this research. The \u2018New\u2019 features group consists of dynamic network features from the \u2018Who\u2019 group, topic distribution features from the \u2018What\u2019 group, and all features in the \u2018Hybrid\u2019 group."}, {"heading": "5.3.1 Binary classification", "text": "In the case of binary classifications, a movie is classified into one of the two classes: successful or unsuccessful movies. Two decision boundaries are evaluated and both ensure a sufficient amount of ROI is garnished if a movie is considered successful.\n1. The first decision boundary is that a movie is considered successful if its ROI is within\ntop 30% of all movies. For our dataset, this threshold of profitability translates to ROI\u2265 24%. The performance of the top two classification algorithms is listed in Table 2, with a Random Forest classifier (n=200) generating the highest AUC and a Logistic Regression classifier leading in accuracy and F1 score.\nTable 3 shows the results when one group of features is removed from the classifier. As can be observed, performance of the classifier deteriorates when any group of features is removed. This indicates that each of the five groups, including the novel features we proposed, can contribute to the prediction of movie success. Measured by AUC, \u2018What\u2019 features are the biggest contributor as the the classifier without them sees the greatest deterioration, followed by \u2018Who\u2019 and \u2018New\u2019. \u2018When\u2019 and \u2018Hybrid\u2019 features have little contribution to this prediction.\n2. The second boundary we tested is ROI \u2265 67%, which corresponds to 1/4 standard\ndeviation above the mean ROI. With this threshold, 21.4% of the movies in our dataset are considered successful. Compared to the decision boundary of top 30% ROI, this boundary further raises the bar for a movie to be successful. By defining profitability in this manner, our predictive task has become easier, which we observe through an increase in model performance. Top performing algorithms are able to reach AUC and accuracy over 0.8 (see Table 4).\nIn addition, all feature groups contribute to the prediction of movie success(Table 5). Compared to the results of the first boundary, \u2018Who\u2019 features are still major contributors, as removing them has the greatest impact on the Random Forest classifier\u2019s performance. However, different from the case of predicting top 30% ROI movies, this prediction of highly successful movies versus other movies gets more contributions from \u2018When\u2019 features than \u2018What\u2019 features."}, {"heading": "5.3.2 Multi-class classification", "text": "In the case of multi-class classifications, we define three possible classes for a movie: positive (\u2018success\u2019), negative (\u2018failure\u2019), or neutral (\u2018average\u2019) to provide more information to investors\non where they could expect a movie to fall as far as profitability is concerned. For the multi-class prediction, we explored the imposition of cost associated with mis-classification, because the three classes are ordinal, whereas binary classes are nominal. In other words, not all mis-classification errors are equally severe. For example, for investment decision support, predicting a failure to be a success would be worse than predicting it to be a neutral movie. The cost matrix for the multi-class classification is in Table 6\u2013the penalty imposed for classifying a successful movie as failure is 2, and vice-versa, whereas the penalty for only mis-classifying by one ordinal category (i.e., success as neutral, neutral as failure, etc.) is 1.\nActual/Predicted Positive Neutral Negative Positive 0 1 2 Neutral 1 0 1 Negative 2 1 0\nPerformance of the top classifiers for both decision boundaries, including the total cost of mis-classification, is listed in Table 7. Essentially, multi-class prediction gives more information, but is also a more difficult problem. Top classifiers\u2019 performance measured by accuracy\nand F1 score is not as good as those of the binary prediction, but the AUC is very close. Similar to the second boundary of binary classification, the prediction results for the second multi-class boundary also improve with a near 25% decrease in the total mis-classification cost. We conjecture that by raising the bar for success and lowering the bar for failures we may have widened the gap between the three classes."}, {"heading": "6 Discussions", "text": ""}, {"heading": "6.1 Important features for prediction", "text": "When illustrating the performance of our predictive models, we also showed that each of the five groups of features contributed differently to the prediction. Besides the five groups of features, it is also important to understand contributions from individual features. To begin, we ranked features based on their information gain. Table 8 lists top features in each feature category and their overall rankings among all the 111 features for our predictive model.\nAs we can observe, each category contains features that rank within top 50 among all features. Many of the new features we proposed are ranked highly across several categories, such as Cast Novelty, Change in clustering coefficient, Annual Weighted Profitability by Genre, and Annual Profitability Percentage by Genre. We also acknowledge that several \u2018classic\u2019 features that were typically incorporated into movie-related predictive models were also found to be significant contributors, including an \u2018R\u2019 rating and the \u2018Foreign\u2019 genre. Among all the features, those from the \u2018Who (star power)\u2019 category dominate the overall ranking. This suggests that, similar to the findings by [21], star power has a large bearing\non the success of movies.\nTo further explore the relationship between \u2018star power\u2019 and movie success, we plotted total actor gross, a popular measure of star power, against raw profits, as well as against gross revenues, in Figure 5. As we can observe there is no strong correlation between star power and profit, denoted by a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.1699. However, with regard to revenue, the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.4622. This further highlights the\ndifference between measuring success with revenue and profit. Popular stars act as a means for drawing crowds to movies \u2013 a movie featuring Tom Cruise is likely to attract quite a crowd, often regardless of what the movie is actually about. However, in the case of profit predictions, we must also consider that casting Cruise in a movie was not by any means a cheap endeavor and, if that cost was not recouped via tickets sales, then the cost is sunk."}, {"heading": "6.2 Predictability", "text": "To better understand what types of movies are more predictable in terms of profitability, we analyzed the predictability of movies based on the period of release and by star powers, because movies released during holidays or with high star powers often gain big box-office revenues [19, 20]. Predictability is measured using predictive accuracies.\nHowever, it turns out these movies are also the most difficult to predict: movies released over the holidays (6a) and movies with the highest star powers (6b) receive the lowest predictive accuracy. The low predictability of profits for these movies, which are likely to gain high revenues, further illustrate the discrepancy between revenues and profits: movies that sell better at box offices may also need bigger investments and thus do not necessarily guarantee satisfactory returns for investors. Such uncertainty in the success of of high-stakes movies again highlights the need for our decision support system. In addition, from the previous subsection, we see that star power is a big contributor to the model\u2019s predictive power, but high-star-power movies are still difficult to predict. It may be that the high contributions from star power features are mainly garnished for the predictions of movies with low or medium star powers.\n\u2018"}, {"heading": "6.3 Limitations", "text": "Admittedly, our study has limitations. For one, as we have mentioned, there are possible biases that exist as far as our sampling goes. As related by Figure 3, we can see that our\ndataset is relatively representative in terms of movie genres. However, the limited availability of both budget and revenue data may introduce bias to our dataset for the experiment, even though we only exclude 17% of all movies produced in the 11-year time period, because of the lack of either kind of data.\nAnother limitation is that the profit we calculate is based on production budget and box office revenue. For many movies, box office revenue is only one of the sources for income. For example, Disney\u2019s animation movies often gain a significant amount of their revenues from the sale of movie merchandise, such as clothing and toys. Some movies may also rely heavily on the sale and rental of DVDs besides ticket sales. However, capturing these non-box-office revenues is more difficult as they may keep accumulating many years after the release of a movie."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions and future work", "text": "In this study, we proposed the framework of a decision support system (named MIAS) to aid investors\u2019 decisions on which movies to invest in. MIAS learns from freely available historical data from various sources and tries to predict the success of movies, which is defined by profitability instead of revenue as most studies did. Also, because investment\ndecisions are made very early in the movie production process, the features our system uses only leverages data that is available early on. These features include both classic ones and novel ones that were proposed for the first time. They describe \u201cwho\u201d are on the cast from both individual and network perspectives, \u201cwhat\u201d a movie is about in terms of genre, rating, and topics of plot synopses, \u201cwhen\u201d a movie will be released, as well as \u201chybrid\u201d features that match \u201cwho\u201d with \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d with \u201cwhat\u201d features. Our experiments based on 11 years of movies show that MIAS can do a decent job in predicting the success of movies. Moreover, different groups of features, including new features we proposed, all contribute to the prediction.\nThe implications of this study is not limited to movie investment decision support. The framework of MIAS, as well as the \u201cwhat\u201d, \u201cwho\u201d, \u201cwhen\u201d, and \u201chybrid\u201d features we extracted for MIAS, can also be applied to other areas. For example, it can be adapted to predict the success of other creative works, which often requires a team of contributors, whose content can be described with texts, and for which timing is important, such as research papers, grant proposals, investigation reports, etc.\nThere are also several directions for future research. For example, as we have matched \u201cwhat\u201d with \u201cwhen\u201d and \u201cwhat\u201d with \u201cwho\u201d, it would be interesting to match \u201cwho\u201d with \u201cwhen\u201d to capture whether the popularity or an actor or director is on the rise or decline. This will require more fine-grained analysis of an actor or director\u2019s career. Also, while we have considered the formal collaboration network among actors, the informal friendship network may also play a role in the formation and success of a cast, although such a network will be more difficult to capture."}], "references": [{"title": "Prediction of Movies Box Office Performance Using Social Media", "author": ["K.R.
