Such discipline, where sentiment, opinion or emotion, are identified and classified in human written text is well known as sentiment analysis.\nWith the rapid increase of available subjective text on the internet in the form of blog posts, comments in discussion forums and product reviews, mining the user\u2019s opinion can assist in a lot of potential applications in areas such as recommender systems, search engines and market research.\nAlthough some attempts have been made to extend solutions to other languages, till date all research efforts found in sentiment analysis literature deal mostly with English texts. However, in order to identify sentiment from a text, a lexical analysis of the source language plays a crucial role.\nAn approach for detecting sentiment in texts concerns the use of lexical resources such as a dictionaries of opinionated terms. For example the terms love, good and favorite directly indicate a positive sentiment or an opinion, while words like hate, bad and scandal can be associated with a negative sentiment. ? This work has been accepted for publication at the 12th International Workshop on Natural\nLanguage Processing and Cognitive Science (NLPCS 2015).\nar X\niv :1\n50 7.\n00 13\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\nJ ul\nAmong the others, SentiWordNet [9] is one of the most used resource, containing opinion information on terms extracted from the WordNet database [13] and made publicly available for research purposes. It is built via a semi supervised method and is considered a valuable resource for performing opinion mining tasks, providing a readily available database of term sentiment information for the English language.\nOther previous works [14,9] have been already proposed for making dictionaries for those sentiment words using automatic approaches, however automatic identification of polarity orientation of such words is also a difficult research issue, known as polarity identification. In this context, it has been shown that the use of sentiment lexicons only provide a good baseline i.e. without using any natural language techniques only dictionary based approach produce a good performance [7].\nAn alternative to automatic tagged resources are manually annotated lexicons which turns out to be undoubtedly more trustable although they took long time to be constructed and may be subject it annotator bias.\nIn this paper we present SABRINA (Sentiment Analysis: a Broad Resource for Italian Natural language Applications) a manually annotated prior polarity lexical resource for Italian natural language applications in the field of opinion mining and sentiment induction. The resource consists in two different sets, an Italian dictionary of more than 277.000 words tagged with their prior polarity value, and a set of polarity modifiers, containing more than 200 words, which can be used in combination with non neutral terms of the dictionary in order to induce the sentiment of Italian compound terms. To the best of our knowledge this is the first prior polarity manually annotated resource which has been developed for the Italian natural language.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the concept of prior and posterior polarity and present some known lexicons which label terms with their sentiment polarity. Then in Section 3 we present the new tagged resources which has been created for the Italian language and discuss its properties. In Section 4 we briefly introduce also a web based fronted for accessing the resources. We draw our conclusions in Section 5."}, {"heading": "2 Prior and Posterior Polarity", "text": "A typical computational approach to sentiment analysis starts with prior polarity lexicons where entries are tagged with their prior out of context polarity as human beings perceive using cognitive knowledge.\nThe prior polarity of a term is the sentiment (positive or negative) that such word evokes by itself. More specifically we could define the prior polarity of a term as the polarity for its non-disambiguated meaning, out of any context.\nFor example the adjective cold evokes (in most cases) a fairly negative sentiment, since it is used in sentences as a cold man, a cold winter or I feel cold. However, depending on the context, we can find such term in sentences with a positive acceptation, as in I love cold beer.\nIn contrast with the prior polarity of a word, the polarities associated to each word sense is called in literature posterior polarity.\nIn most cases prior polarity lexicons are lists of positive and negative words, often deployed as baselines or as features for other methods for sentiment analysis research [11]. In these lexicon, words are associated with their prior polarity. For example it is presumable that the term wonderful is associated with positive connotation while the term horrible is associated with negative one. These approaches have the advantage of not needing deep semantic analysis or word sense disambiguation to assign an affective score to a word and are domain independent. In other word they are less precise but more portable."}, {"heading": "2.1 Polarity Lexicons", "text": "Opinion lexicons are resources that associate sentiment orientation and words. Their use in opinion mining research stems from the hypothesis that individual words can be considered as a unit of opinion information, and therefore may provide clues to document sentiment and subjectivity. These techniques could be broadly categorized in two genres: manual annotation and automatic extraction of word polarity.\n\u2013 Manual annotation. Manual annotated lexicons are undoubtedly trustable but it took long time and, for these reasons, tend to be constrained to a small number of terms. By its nature, building manual lists is a time consuming effort, and may be subject to annotator bias. Although such limitations manually created opinion lexicons were applied to sentiment classification as seen in [14], where a prediction of document polarity is given by counting positive and negative terms.\n\u2013 Automatic detection. To overcome the above issues lexical induction approaches have been proposed in the literature with a view to extend the size of opinion lexicons from a core set of seed terms, either by exploring term relationships, or by evaluating similarities in document corpora. Early work in this area seen in [10] extends a list of positive and negative adjectives by evaluating conjunctive statements in a document corpus. However in most cases automatic processes still demands manual validations and, moreover, may fail to cover the multiple domains as automatic processes trust on specific corpus.\nSentiWordNet [9] is one of the most popular lexical resources in Sentiment Analysis. It has been widely adopted since it provides a broad-coverage lexicon, built in a semi-automatic manner, for English providing posterior polarities scores for each term of the language. It is the result of the automatic annotation of all the synsets of WordNet [13] according to the notions of positivity, negativity, and neutrality. Different senses of the same term may thus have different opinion-related properties.\nHowever in most opinion mining applications it is necessary to derive prior polarities from the posteriors. For this reason several formulae to compute prior polarities starting from posterior polarities scores have been proposed in the literature. However, their performance varies significantly depending on the adopted variant.\nFor instance SentiWords is an inducted prior polarity lexicon with the higher coverage for the English language. It contains roughly 155.000 words associated with a sentiment score included between \u22121 (strongly negative) and 1 (strongly positive), learned from SentiWordNet. Words in this resource are also aligned with WordNet lists.\nFor the sake of completeness we notice also that other prior polarity sentiment lexicons are available for the English language, such as Subjectivity Word List [17], WordNet Affect list [15] and the Taboada\u2019s adjective list [16].\nAlthough most of the efforts in literature have been devoted to the construction on lexicons resource for the English language, in recent years some research endeavors could be found in literature for solving the opinion mining problem in several languages and domains [7]. Until date most of the approaches to sentiment analysis in languages different from English consists in applying a word-translation from the target language to English before polarity extraction, which is applied by using one of the above described lexicons. Such solutions, however, presents several problems including translation precision and disambiguation of words.\nRecently some efforts have also been made to produce polarity lexicons also for languages different from English. For instance in [6] the authors proposed multiple computational techniques like, WordNet based, dictionary based, corpus based or generative approaches for generating SentiWordNet for Indian languages.\nFor the sake of completeness we mention also an interactive gaming approach used for obtaining polarity values of english words, presented in [7], where the authors proposed a tool, named Dr. Sentiment. to create and validate SentiWordNet in 56 languages by involving Internet population."}, {"heading": "3 New broad Lexical Resources for the Italian Language", "text": "In this section we present SABRINA1 (Sentiment Analysis: a Broad Resource for Italian Natural language Applications) a manually annotated prior polarity lexical resource for Italian natural language applications in the field of opinion mining and sentiment induction.

In the recent Evalita 2014 edition the Sentipolc (SENTIment POLarity Classification) task2 [2] was proposed. It focused on Italian texts from Twitter by launching a battery of related tasks with an increasing level of complexity.\nA first automatic annotated lexicon for the Italian language has been developed in [1], where the authors exploited three existing resources, namely MultiWordNet [5], SentiWordNet [9], and WordNet [13] to obtain an annotated lexicon of senses for Italian. It was named Sentix and basically port the SentiWordNet annotation to the Italian\n1 A tool for evaluating SABRINA is available at the anonymous url http://www.dmi. unict.it/\u02dcfaro/sabrina.

Sentix was then used in [4] where the author described the UNITOR system that participated to the Sentipolc task within the context of Evalita 2014. The system has been developed as a workflow of Support Vector Machine classifiers. Specific features and kernel functions have been used to tackle the different sub-tasks, i.e. Subjectivity Classification, Polarity Classification and the pilot task Irony Detection.\nTo the best of our knowledge, besides Sentix, SABRINA is the first prior polarity manually annotated resource which has been developed for the Italian natural language."}, {"heading": "3.1 Italian Polarity Lexicon", "text": "Most sentiment lexicons in literature contain lists of tagged lemmas, i.e. the canonical form ( or dictionary form) of a word. For instance the lastest version of MultiWordNet (1.39) contains around 58, 000 Italian word senses and 41, 500 lemmas organized into 32, 700 synsets aligned whenever possible with Princeton WordNet English synsets. In using such kind of resources in sentiment analysis it is necessary to operate a previous step of sense disambiguation in order to identify the correspondent lemma of a word.\nOur lexicon contains 277.387 words of the Italian language, including their inflection, used in order to express different grammatical categories such as tense, mood, person, gender, etc. For instance the dictionary contains the verb correre (to run) and its conjugations correvo, correra\u0300, corressi, etc.\nSuch set of words have been manually tagged with their prior polarities. The annotation process started from the word set in the Ispell Italian dictionary3 used for spellchecking purpose. Each word of the lexicon has been associated with a polarity in the range between \u22121 and 1, where \u22121 indicates a strongly negative polarity while 1 indicates a very positive polarity. Mildly negative or positive opinion polarity have been tagged, respectively, with values \u22120.5 and 0.5. In addition terms with a neutral polarity have been tagged with a value equal to 0.\nTwo human annotators have been involved in the tagging process. The whole annotation process took more than three months.\nFigure 1 shows the polarity distribution of all words of the Italian dictionary. We observed 162.000 words which have been tagged with a neutral sentiment polarity, more than 70.000 with a negative polarity and more than 43.000 words tagged with a positive polarity.\nSpecifically words evoking a negative sentiment are divided in two sets, 22.651 with a strongly negative polarity and 49.074 words with a fairly negative polarity. Similarly, in the case of words evoking a positive sentiment, we observed 6.739 words with a strongly positive polarity and 36.688 words with a fairly positive polarity. Table 1 shows in details the number of words detected for each polarity value together with the percentage of words detected in each group. Notice that more than 40% of words have been assigned to a polarity values, while 58% of words have been assigned with a neutral polarity.\n3 Ispell is a program that helps you to correct spelling and typographical errors in a file. When presented with a word that is not in the dictionary, ispell attempts to find near misses that might include the word you meant.\nTabella 1 -1 22651 0.05 49074\n0 162170\n0.05 36688\n1 6739"}, {"heading": "3.2 Polarity Modifiers", "text": "An adjective is a word or set of words that modifies a noun or a pronoun. In most cases adjectives come before the word they modify. Some adjective can modify the polarity of a noun with a non neutral prior polarity. For example the adjective raro (rare) can be used in composition with the adjective bellezza (beauty) to emphasize its positive meaning (a women with a rare beauty). Similarly the adjective esiguo (scarse) can be used in combination with the noun valore (virtue) changing its positive polarity in a negative sentiment (a man with scarse virtue).\nAn adverb is a word or set of words that modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Generally an adverb answers how, when, where, or to what extent an action is performed or an adjective is applicable. In this context some adverbs are able to modify the sentiment evoked by a verb or by an adjective with non neutral polarity. For instance the adverb appena (barely) can be associated with an adjective in order to reduce its positive (or negative) polarity, e.g. barely succeed or barely enthusiast. Similarly the adverb davvero (truly) can be associated with an adjective like sorprendente (amazing) in order to emphasize its positive meaning.\nIn our work we collected a set of more than 200 polarity modifier which have been manually tagged with a proportionality factor ranging between \u22122.0 and +2.0. When a term with a non neutral polarity x is associated with a modifier with a proportionality factor y, we obtain a compound term whose polarity can be estimated as (x\u00d7 y).\nDepending on the value of such factor we can distinguish four different kind of modifiers.\n\u2013 Emphasize These modifiers have a proportionality factor greater than +1.0 and, when associated with a term having a non neutral polarity, evokes a sentiment which is stronger than the original one. thus they emphasize a positive (or negative) polarity value.\nproprio bello (really beautiful) = +1.6\u00d7+1.0 = +1.6 alquanto sgradevole (rather unpleasant) = +1.5\u00d7\u22121.0 = \u22121.5 grande valore (great virtue) = +1.8\u00d7+0.5 = +0.9\n\u2013 Moderate These modifiers have a proportionality factor greater than 0.0 and smaller than +1.0. When associated with a term having a non neutral polarity, they result in a compound term with a moderated sentiment which is weaker than the original one.\nappena vinto (just gained) = +0.7\u00d7+0.5 = +0.35 mediamente brutto (ugly on average) = +0.5\u00d7\u22121.0 = \u22120.5 breve successo (brief success) = +0.6\u00d7+0.5 = +0.3\n\u2013 Reverse and moderate This kind of modifiers have a proportionality factor greater than \u22121.0 and smaller than 0.0. When they are associated with a term having a non neutral polarity, evoke a sentiment which is in opposition with the original sentiment, but has an absolute value of polarity which is smaller than the original polarity.\npoco ragionevole (little reasonable) = \u22120.7\u00d7+0.5 = \u22120.35 esiguo dolore (scarse pain) = \u22120.7\u00d7\u22121.0 = +0.7 limitato guadagno (limited benefit) = \u22120.8\u00d7+1.0 = \u22120.8\n\u2013 Reverse and emphasize These modifiers have a proportionality factor smaller or equal than \u22121.0 and, if associated with a term having a non neutral polarity, evokes a sentiment which is stronger than the original one but with an opposite polarity.\ninsufficiente prestigio (insufficient prestige) = \u22121.2\u00d7 1.0 = \u22121.2 minime scomodita\u0300 (minimal inconvenience) = \u22121.0\u00d7\u22120.5 = +0.5 scarso valore (lacking virtue) = \u22121.2\u00d7+0.5 = \u22120.6\nIn Table 4 some examples of polarity modifiers are shown together with their respective proportionality factors."}, {"heading": "4 A Web Based Frontend", "text": "We implemented a simple web based tool in order to access the lexical resource presented in this paper.

In particular the set of polarity values contained in the sentence is arranged from the lowest one to the highest one and the median of such a set is taken as the polarity value of the whole sentence.\nSpecifically the median is the number separating the higher half of the set of polarity values from the lower half. If there is an even number of polarity values, then there is no single middle value. Int this cases the median is usually defined to be the mean of the two middle values."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper we presented a new lexical resource for the Italian language containing more than 277.000 words which have been manually tagged with their prior polarity values, i.e. a value indicating the sentiment which such words evoke when are out of any context.

Broad Resource for Italian Natural language Applications) a manually annotated prior polarity lexical resource for Italian natural language applications in the field of opinion mining and sentiment induction. The resource consists in two different sets, an Italian dictionary of more than 277.000 words tagged with their prior polarity value, and a set of polarity modifiers, containing more than 200 words, which can be used in combination with non neutral terms of the dictionary in order to induce the sentiment of Italian compound terms. To the best of our knowledge this is the first prior polarity manually annotated resource which has been developed for the Italian natural language.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
