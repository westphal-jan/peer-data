Introduction", "text": "Determinantal point processes (DPPs) arose in statistical mechanics, where they were originally used to model fermions (Macchi, 1975). Recently, they have witnessed substantial interest in a variety of machine learning applications (Kulesza, 2013; Kulesza and Taskar, 2012).\nOne of the key features of DPPs is their ability to model the notion of diversity while respecting quality, a concern that underlies the broader task of subset selection where balancing quality with diversity is a well-known issue\u2014see e.g., document summarization (Lin and Bilmes, 2012), object retrieval (Affandi et al., 2014), recommender systems (Zhou et al., 2010), and sensor placement (Krause et al., 2008).\nDPPs are also interesting in their own right: they have various combinatorial, probabilistic, and analytic properties, while involving a fascinating set of open problems (Lyons, 2003; Hough et al., 2006; Kulesza, 2013).\nWithin machine learning DPPs have found good use\u2014see\nProceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Lille, France, 2015.

For additional references and material we refer the reader to the survey (Kulesza and Taskar, 2012).\nOur paper is motivated by the recent work of Gillenwater et al. (2014), who made notable progress on the task of learning a DPP kernel from data. This task is conjectured to be NP-Hard (Kulesza, 2013, Conjecture 4.1). Gillenwater et al. (2014) presented a carefully designed EM-style procedure, which, unlike several previous approaches (e.g., (Kulesza and Taskar, 2011b;a; Affandi et al., 2014)) learns a full DPP kernel nonparameterically.\nOne main observation of Gillenwater et al. (2014) is that applying projected gradient ascent to the DPP log-likelihood usually results in degenerate estimates (because it involves projection onto the set {X : 0 X I}). Hence one may wonder if instead we could apply more sophisticated manifold optimization techniques (Absil et al., 2009; Boumal et al., 2014). While this idea is attractive, and indeed applicable, e.g., via the excellent MANOPT toolbox (Boumal et al., 2014), empirically it turns out to be computationally too demanding; the EM strategy of Gillenwater et al. (2014) is more practical.\nWe depart from both EM and manifold optimization to develop a new learning algorithm that (a) is simple, yet powerful; and (b) yields essentially the same log-likelihood values as the EM approach while running significantly faster. In particular, our algorithm runs an order of magnitude faster on larger problems.\nThe key innovation of our approach is a derivation via a fixed-point view, which by construction ensures positive definiteness at every iteration. Its convergence analysis involves an implicit bound-optimization iteration to ensure monotonic ascent.1 A pleasant byproduct of the fixed-point approach is that it avoids any eigenvalue/vector computations, enabling a further savings in running time.\n1The convergence analysis in this version of the paper improves upon our original submission, in that our proof is now constructive and requires weaker assumptions.\nar X\niv :1\n50 8.\n00 79\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 4\nA ug\n2 01\n5"}, {"heading": "1.1. Background and problem setup", "text": "Without loss of generality we assume that the ground set of N items is {1, 2, . . . , N}, which we denote by Y . A (discrete) DPP on Y is a probability measure P on 2Y (the set of all subsets of Y) such that for any Y \u2286 Y , the probability P(Y ) verifies P(Y ) \u221d det(LY ); here LY denotes the principal submatrix of the DPP kernel L induced by indices in Y . Intuitively, the diagonal entry Lii of the kernel matrix L captures some notion of the importance of item i, whereas an off-diagonal entry Lij = Lji measures similarity between items i and j. This intuitive notion provides further motivation for seeking DPPs with non-diagonal kernels when there is implicit interaction between the observed items.\nThe normalization constant for the measure P follows upon observing that \u2211 Y\u2286Y det(LY ) = det(L+ I). Thus,\nP(Y ) = det(LY ) det(L+ I) , Y \u2286 Y. (1.1)\nDPPs can also be given an alternative representation through a marginal kernel K that captures for a random Y \u223c P and every A \u2286 Y , the marginal probability\nP(A \u2286 Y ) = det(KA). (1.2)\nIt is easy to verify thatK = L(L+I)\u22121, which also implies that K and L have the same eigenvectors and differ only in their eigenvalues. It can also be shown (Kulesza, 2013) that P(Y ) = |det(K \u2212 IY c)|, where IY c is a partial N \u00d7 N identity matrix with diagonal entries in Y zeroed out.\nBoth parameterizations (1.1) and (1.2) of the DPP probability are useful: Gillenwater et al. (2014) used a formulation in terms of K; we prefer (1.1) as it aligns better with our algorithmic approach."}, {"heading": "1.2. Learning the DPP Kernel", "text": "The learning task aims to fit a DPP kernel (either L or equivalently the marginal kernel K) consistent with a collection of observed subsets. Suppose we obtain as training data n subsets (Y1, . . . , Yn) of the ground setY . The task is to maximize the likelihood of these observations. Two equivalent formulations of this maximization task may be considered:\nmax L 0 \u2211n i=1 log det(LYi)\u2212 n log det(I + L), (1.3)\nmax 0 K I \u2211n i=1 log ( |det(K \u2212 IY ci )| ) . (1.4)\nWe will use formulation (1.3) in this paper. Gillenwater et al. (2014) used (1.4) and exploited its structure to derive a somewhat intricate EM-style method for optimizing it. Both (1.3) and (1.4) are nonconvex and difficult optimize.\nFor instance, using projected gradient on (1.4) may seem tempting, but projection ends up yielding degenerate (diagonal and rank-deficient) solutions which is undesirable when trying to capture interaction between observations\u2014indeed, this criticism motivated Gillenwater et al. (2014) to derive the EM algorithm.\nWe approach problem (1.3) from a different viewpoint (which also avoids projection) and as a result obtain a new optimization algorithm for estimating L. This algorithm, its analysis, and empirical performance are the subject of the remainder of the paper."}, {"heading": "2. Optimization algorithm", "text": "The method that we derive has two key components: (i) a fixed-point view that helps obtain an iteration that satisfies the crucial positive definiteness constraint L 0 by construction; and (ii) an implicit bound optimization based analysis that ensures monotonic ascent. The resulting algorithm is vastly simpler than the previous EM-style approach of Gillenwater et al. (2014).\nIf |Y | = k, then for a suitable N \u00d7 k indicator matrix U we can write LY = U\u2217LU , which is also known as a compression (U\u2217 denotes the Hermitian transpose). We write U\u2217i LUi interchangeably with LYi , implicitly assuming suitable indicator matrices Ui such that U\u2217i Ui = I|Yi|. To reduce clutter, we will drop the subscript on the identity matrix, its dimension being clear from context.\nDenote by \u03c6(L) the objective function in (1.3). Assume for simplicity that the constraint set is open, i.e., L 0. Then any critical point of the log-likelihood must satisfy\n\u2207\u03c6(L) = 0, or equivalently\u2211n i=1 Ui (U \u2217 i LUi) \u22121 U\u2217i \u2212 n (I + L) \u22121 = 0. (2.1)\nAny (strictly) positive definite solution to the nonlinear matrix equation (2.1) is a candidate locally optimal solution.\nWe solve this matrix equation by developing a fixed-point iteration. In particular, define\n\u2206 := 1n \u2211n i=1 Ui (U \u2217 i LUi) \u22121 U\u2217i \u2212 (I + L)\u22121,\nwith which we may equivalently write (2.1) as\n\u2206 + L\u22121 = L\u22121. (2.2)\nEquation (2.2) suggests the following iteration\nL\u22121k+1 \u2190 L \u22121 k + \u2206k, k = 0, 1, . . . . (2.3)\nA priori there is no reason for iteration (2.3) to be valid (i.e., converge to a stationary point). But we write it in this form to highlight its crucial feature: starting from an initial L0 0, it generates positive definite iterates (Prop. 2.1).\nProposition 2.1. Let L0 0. Then, the sequence {Lk}k\u22651 generated by (2.3) remains positive definite.\nProof. The proof is by induction. It suffices to show that\nL 0 =\u21d2 L\u22121 + \u2206 0.\nSince I + L L, from the order inversion property of the matrix inverse map it follows that L\u22121 (I + L)\u22121. Now adding the matrix 1n \u2211 i=1 Ui (U \u2217 i LUi) \u22121 U\u2217i 0 we obtain the desired inequality by definition of \u2206.\nA quick experiment reveals that iteration (2.3) does not converge to a local maximizer of \u03c6(L). To fix this defect, we rewrite the key equation (2.2) in a different manner:\nL = L+ L\u2206L. (2.4)\nThis equation is obtained by multiplying (2.2) on the left and right by L. Therefore, we now consider the iteration\nLk+1 \u2190 Lk + Lk\u2206kLk, k = 0, 1, . . . . (2.5)\nProp. 2.1 in combination with the fact that congruence preserves positive definiteness (i.e., if X 0, then Z\u2217XZ 0 for any complex matrix Z), implies that if L0 0, then the sequence {Lk}k\u22651 obtained from iteration (2.5) is also positive definite. What is more remarkable is that contrary to iteration (2.3), the sequence generated by (2.5) monotonically increases the log-likelihood.\nWhile monotonicity is not apparent from our intuitive derivation above, it becomes apparent once we recognize an implicit change of variables that seems to underlie our method."}, {"heading": "2.1. Convergence Analysis", "text": "Theorem 2.2. Let Lk be generated via (2.5). Then, the sequence {\u03c6(Lk)}k\u22650 is monotonically increasing.\nBefore proving Theorem 2.2 we need the following lemma.\nLemma 2.3. Let U \u2208 CN\u00d7k (k \u2264 N ) such that U\u2217U = I . The map g(S) := log det(U\u2217S\u22121U) is convex on the set of positive definite matrices.\nProof. Since g is continuous it suffices to establish midpoint convexity. Consider therefore, X,Y 0 and let\nX#Y = X1/2(X\u22121/2Y X\u22121/2)1/2X1/2\nbe their geometric mean. The operator inequality X#Y X+Y\n2 is well-known (Bhatia, 2007, Thm. 4.1.3). Hence,( X+Y\n2 )\u22121 (X#Y )\u22121 = X\u22121#Y \u22121 U\u2217 ( X+Y\n2 )\u22121 U U\u2217(X\u22121#Y \u22121)U (U\u2217X\u22121U)#(U\u2217Y \u22121U),\nwhere equality follows from (Bhatia, 2007, Thm. 4.1.3), and the final inequality follows from (Bhatia, 2007, Thm. 4.1.5)2 Since log det is monotonic on positive definite matrices and since det(A#B) = \u221a detA \u221a detB, it then follows that\nlog det ( U\u2217 ( X+Y\n2 )\u22121 U ) \u2264 12 log det(U \u2217X\u22121U)\n+ 12 log det(U \u2217Y \u22121U),\nwhich proves the lemma.\nNow we are ready to prove Theorem 2.2.\nProof (Thm. 2.2). The key insight is to consider S = L\u22121 instead of L; this change is only for the analysis\u2014the actual iteration that we implement is still (2.5).3\nWriting \u03c8(S) := \u03c6(L), we see that \u03c8(S) equals\n1 n \u2211 i log det(U\u2217i S \u22121Ui)\u2212 log det(S\u22121 + I)\n= log det(S) + 1n \u2211 i log det(U\u2217i S \u22121Ui)\n\u2212 log det(I + S). Let h(S) = 1n \u2211 i log det(U \u2217 i S \u22121Ui)\u2212log det(I+S), and f(S) = log det(S). Clearly, f is concave in S, while h is convex is S; the latter from Lemma 2.3 and the fact that \u2212 log det(I + S) is convex. This observation allows us to invoke iterative bound-optimization (an idea that underlies EM, CCCP, and other related algorithms).\nIn particular, we construct an auxiliary function \u03be so that\n\u03c8(S) \u2265 \u03be(S,R), \u2200S,R 0, \u03c8(S) = \u03be(S, S), \u2200S 0.\nAs in (Yuille and Rangarajan, 2003), we select \u03be by exploiting the convexity of h: as h(S) \u2265 h(R)+\u3008\u2207h(R), S \u2212R\u3009, we simply set\n\u03be(S,R) := f(S) + h(R) + \u3008\u2207h(R) |S \u2212R\u3009 .\nGiven an iterate Sk, we then obtain Sk+1 by solving\nSk+1 := argmaxS 0 \u03be(S, Sk), (2.6)\nwhich clearly ensures monotonicity: \u03c8(Sk+1) \u2265 \u03c8(Sk).\nSince (2.6) has an open set as a constraint and \u03be(S, \u00b7) is strictly concave, to solve (2.6) it suffices to solve the necessary condition \u2207S\u03be(S, Sk) = 0. This amounts to\nS\u22121 = (I + Sk) \u22121 + 1n \u2211 i S\u22121k Ui(U \u2217 i S \u22121 k Ui) \u22121U\u2217i S \u22121 k .\nRewriting in terms of L we immediately see that with Lk+1 = Lk + Lk\u2206kLk, \u03c6(Lk+1) \u2265 \u03c6(Lk) (the inequality is strict unless Lk+1 = Lk).\n2For an explicit proof see (Sra and Hosseini, 2015, Thm. 8). 3Our previous proof was based on viewing iteration (2.5) as a scaled-gradient-like iteration. However, we find the present version more transparent for proving monotonicity.\nTheorem 2.2 shows that iteration (2.5) is well-defined (positive definiteness was established by Prop. 2.1). The fixedpoint formulation (2.5) actually suggests a broader iteration, with an additional step-size a:\nLk+1 = Lk + aLk\u2206kLk. (2.7)\nAbove we showed that for a = 1 ascent is guaranteed. Empirically, a > 1 often works well; Prop. A.1 presents an easily computable upper bound on feasible a. We conjecture that for all feasible values a \u2265 1, iteration (2.5) is guaranteed to increase the log-likelihood.\nMoreover, all previous calculations can be redone in the context where L = F \u2217WF for a fixed feature matrix F in order to learn the weight matrix W (under the assumption that S\u2217S is invertible), making our approach also useful in the context of feature-based DPP learning.\nPseudocode of our resulting learning method is presented in Algorithms 1 and 2. For simplicity, we recommend using a fixed value of a (which can be set at initialization).\nAlgorithm 1 Picard Iteration Input: Matrix L, training set T , step-size a > 0. for i = 1 to maxIter do L\u2190\u2212 FixedPointMap(L, T , a) if stop(L, T , i) then\nbreak end if\nend for return L\nAlgorithm 2 FixedPointMap Input: Matrix L, training set T , step-size a > 0 Z \u2190\u2212 0 for Y in T do ZY = ZY + L \u22121 Y\nend for return L+ aL(Z/|T | \u2212 (L+ I)\u22121)L"}, {"heading": "2.2. Iteration cost and convergence speed", "text": "The cost of each iteration of our algorithm is dominated by the computation of \u2206, which costs a total ofO( \u2211n i=1 |Yi|3+ N3) = O(n\u03ba3 + N3) arithmetic operations, where \u03ba = maxi |Yi|; the O(|Yi|3) cost comes from the time required to compute the inverse L\u22121Yi , while the N\n3 cost stems from computing (I + L)\u22121. Moreover, additional N3 costs arise when computing L\u2206L.\nIn comparison, each iteration of the method of Gillenwater et al. (2014) costs O(nN\u03ba2 + N3), which is comparable to, though slightly greater than O(n\u03ba3 +N3) as N \u2265 \u03ba. In applications where the sizes of the sampled subsets satisfy \u03ba N , the difference can be more substantial. Moreover, we do not need any eigenvalue/vector computations to implement our algorithm.\nFinally, our iteration also runs slightly faster than the KAscent iteration, which costs O(nN3). Additionally, similarly to EM, our algorithm avoids the projection step necessary in the K-Ascent algorithm (which ensures K \u2208 {X : 0 X I}). As shown in (Gillenwater et al., 2014), avoiding this step helps learn non-diagonal matrices.\nWe note in passing that similar to EM, assuming a nonsingular local maximum, we can also obtain a local linear rate of convergence. This follows by relating iteration (2.5) to scaled-gradient methods (Bertsekas, 1999, \u00a71.3) (except that we have an implicit PSD constraint)."}, {"heading": "3.

Let Z = 1n \u2211n i=1 Ui (U \u2217 i LUi) \u22121 U\u2217i .\nTo ensure L+ aL\u2206L 0 we equivalently show\nL\u22121 + a (\n1 n n\u2211 i=1 Ui (U \u2217 i LUi) \u22121 U\u2217i \u2212 (L+ I) \u22121 ) 0\n=\u21d2 I + aL1/2ZL1/2 aL (L+ I)\u22121\n=\u21d2 (1\u2212 a)I + a(I + L)\u22121 + aL1/2ZL1/2 0 (as L(L+ I)\u22121 = I \u2212 (I + L)\u22121)\n=\u21d2 (1\u2212 a) + a\u03bbmin((I + L)\u22121 + L1/2ZL1/2) > 0.\nThis inequality can be numerically optimized to find the largest feasible value of a. The simpler bound in question can be obtained by noting that\n\u03bbmin((I + L) \u22121 + L1/2ZL1/2)\n\u2265 max{\u03bbmin(LZ), 1/\u03bbmax(I + L)} = \u03b3.\nThus, we have the easily computable bound for feasible a:\na \u2264 1 1\u2212 \u03b3 .\nClearly, by construction \u03b3 \u2265 0. To see why \u03b3 \u2264 1, observe that (I + L) \u227a I , so that \u03bbmin((I + L)\u22121) < 1. Further, block-matrix calculations show that Z L\u22121, whereby \u03bbmin(L 1/2ZL1/2) \u2264 \u03bbmin(I) = 1."}], "references": [{"title": "Optimization algorithms on matrix manifolds", "author": ["P.-A.
