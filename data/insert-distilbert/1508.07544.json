Introduction", "text": "Science has experienced a paradigm shift along with the increasing availability of large amounts of digital research data [113]. In addition to the traditional focus on the description of natural phenomena, theory development and computational science, data-driven exploration and discovery have become a dominant ingredient of many methodological frameworks. In line with these developments, the field of computational linguistics (CL) has also evolved.\nHuman communication conveys both verbal and nonverbal information. Research on computational linguistics has primarily focused on capturing the information from verbal content layers and the structure of verbal information transfer, with a particular focus on literal aspects of language use. In the words of Krishnan and Eisenstein [147], computational linguistics has made great progress in modeling language\u2019s informational dimension, but with a few notable exceptions, computation has had little to contribute to our understanding of language\u2019s social dimension. The recent increase in interest of computational linguists to study language in social contexts is partly driven by the ever increasing availability of social media data. Language is one of the instruments by which people construct their online identity and manage their social network. Data from social media platforms provide a strong incentive for innovation of the CL research agenda, but it raises challenges as well. For example, social media language is more colloquial and contains more linguistic variation, such as the use of slang and dialects, than in datasets that have been commonly used in CL research (e.g., newspapers) [65]. However, an even greater challenge is that the relation between social\nvariables and language is typically fluid and tenuous, while the CL field commonly focuses on the level of literal meaning and language structure.\nThe tenuous connection between social variables and language choices arises because of the symbolic nature of the connection, which affords speakers1 the ability to make choices in how to use their linguistic repertoire in order to achieve social goals, a capacity often referred to as the agency of speakers. The symbolic association renders these choices as akin to a currency that can be invested. Speakers may thus make use of specific words or stylistic elements to represent themselves in a certain way. However, because of this agency, social variables cease to have an essential connection with language choices. It may be the case, for example, that female speakers display certain characteristics in their language choices, more so than their male counterparts. Nevertheless, in specific circumstances, females may choose to de-emphasize their identity as females by modulating their language usage to sound more male. Thus, while this exception serves to highlight rather than challenge the commonly accepted symbolic association between gender and language choices, it nevertheless means that it is less feasible to predict how a female will sound in a randomly selected context. Speaker agency also enables creative violations of conventional language choice patterns to communicate subtle meanings as well as for the association between language choices and social variables to evolve over time. Thus, agency is a key factor explaining the variation in and dynamic nature of language practices (both within individual speakers and across speakers). This variation is manifest at various levels of expression \u2013 the choice of lexical elements, phonological variants, semantic alternatives and grammatical patterns \u2013 and plays a central role in the phenomenon of linguistic change. The audience, demographic variables (e.g., gender, age), and speaker goals are among the factors that influence how variation is exhibited in specific contexts. Agency thus increases the intricate complexity of language thatmust be captured in order to achieve a social interpretation of language.\nSociolinguistics investigates the reciprocal influence of society and language on each other. Sociolinguists traditionally work with spoken data using qualitative and quantitative approaches. Surveys and ethnographic research have been the main methods of data collection [61, 173, 174, 248, 254, 267]. The datasets used are often selected and/or constructed to facilitate controlled statistical analyses and insightful observations. However, the resulting datasets are often small in size compared to the standards adopted by the CL community. Themassive volumes of data that have become available from sources such as social media platforms have provided the opportunity to investigate language variation more broadly. The challenge for the field of sociolinguistics is to address questions using this massive data that would be difficult to answer in reduced data sets after sampling the data down, which would be the typical practice in order to bring the scale within the bounds of what is practical with established methods.\nAs more and more researchers in the field of CL seek to interpret language from a social perspective, an increased awareness of insights from the field of sociolinguistics could inspire modeling refinements and potentially lead to performance gains. But the rich repertoire of theory and practice developed by sociolinguists could impact the field of CL also in more fundamental ways. The social nature of language has traditionally not received much attention within CL, and as a consequence in a large body of literature the impact of agency has not been sufficiently taken into account. Various recent studies [121, 244, 259] have demonstrated that existing NLP tools can\n1 We use the term \u2018speaker\u2019 for an individual who has produced a message, either as spoken word or in textual format. When discussing particular social media sites, we may refer to \u2019users\u2019 as well.\nbe improved by accounting for linguistic variation due to social variables. Hovy and S\u00f8gaard [122] have drawn attention to the fact that biases in frequently used corpora, such as the Wall Street Journal, causes NLP tools to perform better on texts written by certain user groups. An understanding of linguistic agency explains why that is the case and enables predicting where that might be more or less of a problem. This issue is discussed in depth in some recent computational work related to gender, specifically Bamman et al. [17] and Nguyen et al. [187] who provide a critical reflection on the operationalization of gender in CL studies.\nThe increasing interest in analyzing and modeling the social dimension of language within CL encourages collaboration between sociolinguistics and CL in various ways. However, the potential for synergy between the two fields has not been explored systematically so far [65] and to date there is no overview of the common and complementary aspects of the two fields. This paper aims to present an integrated overview of research published in the two communities and to describe the state-of-the-art in the emerging multidisciplinary field that could be labeled as \u2018Computational Sociolinguistics\u2019. The envisaged audiences are CL researchers interested in sociolinguistics and sociolinguists interested in computational approaches to study language use. We hope to argue that there is enough substance that warrants the recognition of \u2019Computational Sociolinguistics\u2019 as an autonomous yet multidisciplinary research area, which deserves the development of a research agenda that is recognized in a wider scholarly community maintaining links with both sociolinguistics and computational linguistics.\nIn the remaining part of this section we discuss the rationale and scope of our survey in more detail. Also the potential impact of integrating the social dimensions of language use in the development of practical NLP applications will be discussed. In Section 2 we discuss Methods for Computational Sociolinguistics, in which we reflect on methods used in sociolinguistics and computational linguistics. In Section 3, Language and Social Identity Construction, we discuss how speakers use language to shape perception of their identity and focus on computational approaches to model language variation based on gender, age and geographical location. In Section 4 on Language and Social Interaction, we move from individual speakers to pairs, groups and communities and discuss how language shapes personal relationships, style-shifting, and the adoption of norms and language change in communities. In Section 5 we discuss Multilingualism and Social Interaction, in which we present an overview of tools for processing multilingual communication, such as parsers and language identification systems. We will also discuss approaches for analyzing patterns in multilingual communication from a computational perspective. We conclude with a summary of major challenges within this emerging field."}, {"heading": "1.1 Rationale for a Survey of Computational Sociolinguistics", "text": "The increased interest in studying a social phenomenon such as language use from a data-driven or computational perspective exemplifies a more general trend in scholarly agendas. The study of social phenomena through computational methods is commonly referred to as \u2019Computational Social Science\u2019 [152]. The increasing interest of social scientists in computational methods can be regarded as illustrating the general increase of attention for cross-disciplinary research perspectives. \u2018Multidisciplinary\u2019, \u2018interdisciplinary\u2019, \u2018cross-disciplinary\u2019 and \u2018transdisciplinary\u2019 are among the labels used to mark the shift from monodisciplinary research formats to models of collaboration that embrace diversity in the selection of data and methodological frameworks. However, in spite of various attempts to harmonize terminology, the adoption of such labels is\noften poorly supported by definitions and they tend to be used interchangeably. The objectives of research rooted inmultiple disciplines often include the ambition to resolve real world or complex problems, to provide different perspectives on a problem, or to create cross-cutting research questions, to name a few [39].\nThe emergence of research agendas for (aspects of) computational sociolinguistics fits in this trend. We will use the term Computational Sociolinguistics for the emerging research field that integrates aspects of sociolinguistics and computer science in studying the relation between language and society from a computational perspective. This survey article aims to show the potential of leveragingmassive amounts of data to study social dynamics in language use by combining advances in computational linguistics and machine learning with foundational concepts and insights from sociolinguistics. Our goals for establishing Computational Sociolinguistics include the development of tools to support sociolinguists, the establishment of new statisticalmethods for themodeling and analysis of data that contains linguistic content as well as information on the social context, to the development or refinement of NLP tools based on sociolinguistic insights."}, {"heading": "1.2 Scope of Discussion", "text": "Given the breadth of this field, we will limit the scope of this survey as follows. First of all, the coverage of sociolinguistics topics will be selective and primarily determined by the work within computational linguistics that touches on sociolinguistic topics. For readers with a wish for a more complete overview of sociolinguistics, we recommend the following introductory readings [20, 119, 169]. The availability of social media and other online data is one of the primary driving factors for the emergence of computational sociolinguistics. A relevant research area, but beyond the scope of this survey, is therefore the study of Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) [109]. Considering the strong focus on speech data within sociolinguistics, there is much potential for computational approaches to be applied on speech data aswell. Moreover, the increased availability of recordings of spoken word data and transcribed speech has raised a revival in the study of the social dimensions of spoken language [130], as well as in the analysis of the relation between the verbal and the nonverbal layers in spoken dialogues [256]. In the study of communication in pairs and groups, the individual contributions are often analyzed in context. Therefore, much of the work on language use in settings with multiple speakers draws from foundations in Discourse Analysis [78, 129, 166, 229], Pragmatics (such as SpeechAct Theory [10, 235]), Rhetorical Structure Theory [164, 247] and Social Psychology [87, 206, 223]. For studies that fall within the scope of computational sociolinguistics that build upon these fields the link with the foundational frameworks will be indicated. Another relevant field is computational stylometry [47, 117, 243] which focuses on computational models of writing style for various tasks such as plagiarism detection, author profiling and authorship attribution. We limit our discussion to publications within this field that focus on topics like the link between style and social variables."}, {"heading": "1.3 NLP Applications", "text": "Besides yielding new insights into language use in social contexts, research in computational sociolinguistics could potentially also impact the development of applications for the processing of textual social media and other content. For example, user profiling tools might benefit from research on automatically detecting the gender [33],\nage [186], geographical location [68] or other affiliations of users [204] based on their texts. The challenge is that the cases where it is most helpful to use variables such as age and gender to properly treat the interpretation of the language are the same cases where it is most difficult to automatically detect those variables. Nevertheless, there are some published proofs of concept that suggest potential value in advancing past the typical \u2018static\u2019 view of language embodied in current NLP tools. For example, incorporating how language use varies across social groups has improved word prediction systems [244], algorithms for cyberbullying detection [46] and sentiment-analysis tools [121, 259]. Hovy and S\u00f8gaard [122] shows that POS taggers trained on well-known corpora such as the English Penn Treebank perform better on texts written by older authors. They draw attention to the fact that texts in various frequently used corpora are from a biased sample of authors in terms of demographic factors. Many NLP tools currently assume that the input consists of monolingual text, but this assumption does not hold in all domains. For example, social media users may employ multiple language varieties, even within a single message. To be able to automatically process these texts, NLP tools that are able to deal with multilingual texts are needed [241]."}, {"heading": "2. Methods for Computational Sociolinguistics", "text": "As discussed, one important goal of this article is to stimulate collaboration between the fields of sociolinguistics in particular and social sciences research related to communication more broadly on the one hand, and computational linguistics on the other hand. By addressing the relationship with methods from both sociolinguistics and the social sciences in general we are able to underline two expectations. First of all, we are convinced that sociolinguistics and related fields can help the field of computational linguistics to build richer models that are more effective for the tasks they are or could be used for. Second, the time seems right for the CL community to contribute to sociolinguistics and the social sciences, not only by developing and adjusting tools for sociolinguists, but also by refining the theoretical models within sociolinguistics using computational approaches and contributing to the understanding of the social dynamics in natural language.\nAt the outset of multidisciplinary collaboration, it is necessary to understand differences in goals and values between communities, as these differences strongly influence what counts as a contribution within each field, which in turn influences what it would mean for the fields to contribute to one another. Towards that end, we first discuss the related but distinct notions of reliability and validity, as well as the differing roles these notions have played in each field (Section 2.1). This will help lay a foundation for exploring differences in values and perspective between fields. Here it will be most convenient to begin with quantitative approaches in the social sciences as a frame of reference. In Section 2.2 we discuss contrasting notions of theory and empiricism as well as the relationship between the two, as that will play an important and complementary role in addressing the concern over differing values. In Section 2.3 we broaden the scope to the spectrum of research approaches within the social sciences, including strongly quantitative and strongly qualitative, and the relationship between CL and the social disciplines involved. This will help to further specify the concrete challenges that must be overcome in order for a meaningful exchange between communities to take place. In Section 2.4 we illustrate how these issues come together in the role of data, as the collection, sampling, and preparation of data are of central importance to work in both fields."}, {"heading": "2.1 Validation of Modeling Approaches", "text": "The core of much research in the field of computational linguistics, in the past decade especially, is the development of new methods for computational modeling, such as probabilistic graphical models, and deep learning within a neural network approach. These novel methods are valued both for the creativity that guided the specification of novel model structures and the corresponding requirement for new methods of inference as well as the achievement of predictive accuracy on tasks for which there is some notion of a correct answer.\nDevelopment of new modeling frameworks is part of the research production cycle both within sociolinguistics (and the social sciences in general) and the CL community, and there is a lot of overlap with respect to the types of methods used. For example, logistic regression is widely employed by variationist sociolinguists using a program called VARBRUL [248]. Similarly, logistic regression is widely used in the CL community, especially in combination with regularization methods when dealing with thousands of variables (e.g., for age prediction [186]). As another example, latent variable modeling approaches [143] have grown in prominence within the CL community for dimensionality reduction, managing heterogeneity in terms of multiple domains or multiple tasks [278], and approximation of semantics [25, 100]. Similarly, it has grown in prominence within the quantitative branches of the social sciences for modeling causality [90], managing heterogeneity in terms of group effects and subpopulations [43], and time series modeling [216, 217].\nThe differences in reasons for the application of similar techniques are indicative of differences in values. While in CL there is a value placed on creativity and predictive accuracy, within the social sciences, the related notions of validity and reliability underline the values placed on conceptual contributions to the field. Validity is primarily a measure of the extent to which a research design isolates a particular issue from confounds so that questions can receive clear answers. This typically requires creativity, and frequently research designs for isolating issues effectively are acknowledged for this creativity in much the same way a novel graphical model would be acknowledged for the elegance of its mathematical formulation. Reliability, on the other hand, is primarily a measure of the reproducibility of a result. While this might seem to be a distinct notion from predictive accuracy, the connection is apparentwhen one considers that a common notion of reliability is the extent to which two human coders would arrive at the same judgment about a set of data points, whereas predictive accuracy is the extent to which a model would arrive at the same judgment on a set of data points as an agreed upon set of judgments decided ahead of time by one or more humans. While at some deep level there is much in common between the goals and values of the two communities, the distinctions between validity and creativity as treated in the field of CL as well as between reliability and predictive accuracy as treated the social sciences nevertheless pose challenges for mutual exchange.\nValidity is a multi-faceted notion, and it is important to properly distinguish it from the related notion of reliability. If one considers shooting arrows at a target, one can consider reliability to be a measure of how much convergence is achieved in location of impact of multiple arrows. On the other hand, validity is the extent to which the point of convergence centers on the target. Reproducibility of results is highly valued in both fields, which requires reliability wherever human judgment is involved, such as in the production of a gold standard [35, 55]. However, before techniques from CL will be adopted by social science researchers, standards of validation from the social sciences\nwill likely need to be addressed [146]. And we will see that this notion requires more than the related notion of creativity as appreciated within the field of CL.\nOne aspect that is germane to the notion of validity that goes beyond pure creativity is the extent to which the essence that some construct actually captures corresponds to the intended quantity. This aspect of validity is referred to as face validity. For example, the face validity of a sentiment analysis tool could be tested as follows. First, an automatic measure of sentiment would be applied on a text corpus. Then, texts would be sorted by the resulting sentiment score and the data points from the end points and middle compared with one another. Are there consistent and clear distinctions in sentiment between beginning, middle, and end? Is sentiment the main thing that is captured in the contrast, or is something different really going on? While the CL community have frequently upheld high standards of reliability, it is rare to find work that deeply questions whether the models are measuring the right thing. Nevertheless, this deep questioning is core to high quality work in the social sciences, and without it, the work may appear weak.\nAnother important notion is construct validity, or the extent to which the experimental design manages extraneous variance effectively. If the design fails to do so, it affects the interpretability of the result. This notion applies when we interpret the learnedweights of features in ourmodels tomake statements about language use.When not controlling for confounded variables, the feature weights are misleading and valid interpretation is not possible. For example, many studies on gender prediction (see Section 3) ignore extraneous variables such as age, while gender and age are known to interact highly. Where confounds may not have been properly eliminated in an investigation, again the results may appear weak regardless of the numbers associated with the measure of predictive accuracy.\nTriangulation is an important way of strengthening research findings in the social sciences. This process can again be illustrated with sentiment analysis as an example. Consider a blog corpus where the age of each blogger is noted and assume that a particular predictive model for predicting age placed high weights on some sentiment carrying related words. The experimenters may conclude that this is evidence that the model is consistent with previous findings that older people express more positive sentiment. What might confirm this interpretation would be to use a sentiment analysis technique to measure sentiment explicitly for each blog. If this measured sentiment correlates with the age of bloggers across the corpus, this would provide confirming evidence for the interpretation. This type of confirming evidence is referred to as a measure of convergent validity, since an expected similar relationship is confirmed. Another form of triangulation is where distinctions known to exist are confirmed. For this example, assume that a particular predictive model for predicting political affiliation placed high weights on some sentiment related words in a corpus related to issues for which those affiliated with one political perspective would take a different stance than those affiliated with a different perspective, and this affiliation is known for all data points. The experimenters may conclude that this evidence is consistent with previous findings suggesting that voters express more positive sentiment towards political stances they are in favor of. If this is true, then if the model is applied to a corpus where both parties agree on a stance, the measure of sentiment should become irrelevant. Assuming the difference in the role of sentiment between the corpora is consistent with what is expected, the interpretation is strengthened. This is referred to as divergent validity since an expected difference in relationship is confirmed. Seeking convergent and divergent validity is a mark of high quality work in the social sciences, but it is rare in evaluations in the field of CL, and without it, again, the results may appear weak\nfrom a social science perspective. In order for methods from CL to be acceptable for use within the social sciences, these perceived weaknesses must be addressed."}, {"heading": "2.2 Theory versus Empiricism", "text": "Above we discussed the importance placed on validity within the social sciences that stems from the goal of isolating an issue in order to answer questions. In order to clarify why that\u2019s important, it is necessary to discuss the value placed on theory versus empiricism.\nWithin the CL community a paradigm shift took place after the middle of the 1990s. Initially, approaches that combined symbolic and statistical methods were of interest [141]. But with the focus on very large corpora and new frameworks for largescale statistical modeling, symbolic and knowledge driven methods have been largely left aside. Along with older symbolic methods that required carefully crafted grammars and lexicons, the concept of knowledge source became strongly associated with the notion of theory, which is consistent with the philosophical notion of linguistic theory advocated by Chomskyan linguistics and other theories of formal linguistics [11, 97, 232, 272]. As knowledge-based methods were replaced with statistical models, a grounding in linguistic theory grewmore andmore devalued. A desire to replace theory with empiricism became the Zeitgeist that drove progress within the field. The term theory is associated with old, outdated, symbolic approaches, and thus it has a negative connotation. Often in computational linguistics, theory is opposed to empiricism, which is associated with contemporary modeling approaches believed to have a greater ability to offer insights about language.\nIn contrast, in the social sciences the value of a contribution is measured in terms of the extent to which it contributes towards theory. Theories may begin with human originated ideas. But these notions are only treated as valuable if they are confirmed through empirical methods. As these methods are applied, theoretical models gain empirical support. Findings are ratified and then accumulated. And theories thus become storehouses for knowledge obtained through empirical methods. Atheoretical empiricism is not attractive within the social sciences where the primary value is on building theory and engaging theory in interpretation of models.\nAs CL seeks to contribute to sociolinguistics and the social sciences, this culture clash must be addressed in order to avoid the fields talking at cross purposes. To stimulate a collaboration between fields, it is important to not only focus on task performance, but also to integrate existing theories into the computational models and use these models to refine or develop new theories."}, {"heading": "2.3 Quantitative versus Qualitative Approaches", "text": "The social sciences have both strong qualitative and quantitative branches. Similarly, sociolinguistics has branches in qualitative research (e.g., interactional sociolinguistics) and quantitative research (variationist sociolinguistics). From a methodological perspective, most computational sociolinguistics work has a strong resemblance with variationist sociolinguistics, the subfield that has a strong focus on statistical analysis to uncover the distribution of sociolinguistic variables [248]. Thus, so far we have mostly reflected on methods used in CL and their commonality with the methods used in the quantitative branches in sociolinguistics and the social sciences. However, these fields contain equally strong branches that utilize qualitative methods.\nThe tension between qualitative and quantitative branches can be illustrated with the extent to which the agency of speakers is taken into account. As explained in the introduction, linguistic agency refers to the freedom of speakers to make choices about how they present themselves in interaction. A contrasting notion is the extent to which social structures influence the linguistic choices speakers make. Regardless of research tradition, it is acknowledged that speakers both have agency and are simultaneously influenced by social structures. The question is which is privileged in the research approach. Quantitative researchers believe that the most important variance is captured by representation of the social structure. They recognize that this is a simplification, but the value placed on quantification for the purpose of identifying causal connections between variables makes the sacrifice of accuracy worth it. In the field of CL, this valuing is analogous to the well-known saying that all models are wrong, but some are nevertheless useful. On the other side are researchers committed to the idea that the most important and interesting aspects of language use are the ones that violate norms in order to achieve a goal. These researchers may also doubt that the bulk of choices made by speakers can be accounted for by social structures. We see this balance and tension within sociolinguistics in that many studies within variationist sociolinguistics focus on the influence of social structures [20], but more recently the agency of speakers is playing a more central role [63].\nWhile in CL qualitative research is sometimes dismissed as being quantitative work that lacks rigor, one could argue that high quality qualitative research has a separate notion of rigor and depth that is all its own [177]. An important role for qualitative research is to challenge the operationalizations constructed by quantitative researchers. To achieve the adoption of CL methods and models by social science researchers, the challenges from the qualitative branches of the social sciences will become something to consider carefully.\nAs computational linguistics shares more values with variationist sociolinguistics, many studies within computational sociolinguistics also focus on the influence of social structures. For example, work on prediction of social variables such as gender (Section 3) is based on the assumption that gender determines the language use of speakers. However, such research ignores the agency of speakers: Speakers use language to construct their identity and thus not everyone might write in a way that reflects their biological sex. Moving forward it would make sense for researchers in Computational Sociolinguistics to reflect on the dominant role of social structures over agency. Some work in CL has already begun to acknowledge the agency of speakerswhen interpreting findings [17, 187].\nOne way of conceptualizing the contrast between the usage of computational models in the two fields is to reconsider the trade-off between maximizing interpretability \u2014 typical of the social sciences and sociolinguistics \u2014, versus maximizing predictive accuracy, typical of CL. Both fields place a premium on rigor in evaluation and generalization of results across datasets. To maintain a certain standard of rigor, the CL community has produced practices for standardization of metrics, sampling, and avoidance of over-fitting or over-estimation of performance through careful separation of training and testing data at all stages of model development. Within the social sciences, the striving for rigor also has produced statistical machinery for analysis, but most of all it has resulted in an elaborate process for validation of such modeling approaches and practices for careful application and interpretation of the results.\nOne consequence of the focus on interpretability within the social sciences is that models tend to be kept small and simple in terms of the number of parameters, frequently no more than 10, or at least no more than 100. Because the models are kept\nsimple, they can be estimated on smaller datasets, as long as sampling is done carefully and extraneous variance is controlled. In the CL community, it is more typical for models to include tens of thousands of parameters or more. For such large models, massive corpora are needed to prevent over-fitting. As a result, research in the CL community is frequently driven by the availability of large corpora, which explains the large number of recent papers on data from the web, such as Twitter and Wikipedia. Because of this difference in scale, a major focus on parallelization and approximate inference has been an important focus of work in CL [112], whereas interest in such methods have only recently grown within the social sciences."}, {"heading": "2.4 Spotlight on Corpora and Other Data", "text": "Data collection is a fundamental step in the research cycle for researchers in both sociolinguistics and computational linguistics, but there are important differences in the practices and traditions within both fields. Traditionally sociolinguists have been interested in datasets that capture informal speech (also referred to as the \u2019vernacular\u2019), i.e., the kind of language usedwhen speakers are not paying attention [248]. A variety of methods have been used to collect data, including observation, surveys and interviews [163, 248]. The sociolinguistic datasets are carefully prepared to enable in-depth analyses of how a speech community operates, carefully observing standards of reliability and validity as discussed above. Inevitably, the data collection methods are laborintensive and time-consuming. The resulting datasets are often small in comparison to the ones used within computational linguistics. The small sizes of these datasets made the work in sociolinguistics of limited interest to the field of CL. The tide began to turn with the advent of Web 2.0, which brought with it the possibility to obtain much larger linguistic data sets from social contexts.\nContent generated by users of online platforms (often referred to as User-Generated Content (UGC), such as social media [70, 144], web forums [82, 184] and online reviews [52, 123]), is a rich and easy to access source of large amounts of informal speech coming together with information about the context (e.g., the users, social network structure, the time and geolocation at which it was generated) that can be used for the study of language in social contexts on a large scale. As an example, based on data from Twitter (a popular microblogging site) dialectical variation has been mapped using a fraction of the time, costs and effort that was needed in traditional studies [60].\nThe availability of this data is not only of interest within CL, but also within sociolinguistics. A complicating issue in work in sociolinguistics is that participants might adjust their language use towards the expectations of the data collector. This phenomenon is known as the \u2018observer\u2019s paradox\u2019 and was first coined by Labov [149]: \u2019the aim of linguistic research in the community must be to find out how people talk when they are not being systematically observed; yet we can only obtain these data by systematic observation\u2019. In social media, the observer\u2019s paradox could potentially be argued to have lost much of its strength, making it a promising resource to complement traditional data collection methods. While a convenient source of data, the use of social media data does introduce new challenges which must be addressed regardless of field, and this offers a convenient beginning to a potential exchange between fields.\nFirst, social media users are usually not representative of the general population [175, 186]. A better understanding of the demographics could aid the interpretation of findings, but often little is known about the users. Collecting demographic information requires significant effort, or might not even be possible in some cases due to ethical concerns. Furthermore, in many cases the complete data is not fully accessible through an\nAPI, requiring researchers to apply a sampling strategy (e.g., randomly, by topic, time, individuals/groups, phenomenon [4, 110]), which could introduce additional biases or remove contextual information. This is complicated by the fact that datasets might be reused for secondary analysis by other researchers and that during the data collection it is not known yet which variables will be relevant for future research questions.\nSocial media data also introduce new units of analysis (such as messages and threads) that do not correspond entirely with traditional analysis units (such as sentences and turns) [4]. This raises the question about valid application of findings from prior work. Furthermore, while most sociolinguistic studies are based on oral data and often focus on phonological variation, the use of social media data in computational linguistics has led to a higher focus on lexical variation. However, there are concerns that a focus on lexical variation without regard to other aspects may threaten the validity of conclusions. Phonology does impact social media orthography at both the word level and structural level [66], suggesting that studies on phonological variation could inform studies on texts in social media and vice versa.\nThere are practical concerns as well. First, while both access and content have often been conceptualized as either public or private, in reality this distinction is not as absolute (a user might discuss a private topic on a public social media site). In view of the related privacy issues, Bolander and Locher [26] argue for more awareness regarding the ethical implications of research using social media data.\nAutomatically processing social media data is more difficult compared to various other types of data that have been used within computational linguistics. Many developed tools (e.g., parsers, named entity recognizers) do not work well due to the informal nature of many social media texts. While the dominant response has been to focus on text normalization and domain adaptation, Eisenstein [65] argues that doing so is throwing away meaningful variation. For example, building on work on text normalization, Gouws et al. [94] showed how various transformations (e.g., dropping the last character of a word) vary across different user groups on Twitter. How the different online data sources compare to each other in terms of language use has only received limited attention so far [14, 124].\nApart from raw interaction data provided by Web 2.0, another promising resource for studying language in use from a social perspective is crowdsourcing. So far, crowdsourcing is mostly used to obtain large numbers of annotations (e.g., [238]), but another purpose of involving \u2019crowds\u2019 are large-scale perception studies, i.e., studying how non-linguists interpret messages and identify social characteristics of speakers [41]. Within sociolinguistics, surveys have been one of the instruments to collect data for perception studies, and the use of crowdsourcing can be seen as building upon that methodology. Crowdsourcing has already been used to collect data for studying how English utterances are perceived differently across language communities [162] and how Twitter users are perceived based on their tweets [187]. However, the additional effort for quality control and the fact that little is known is about the workers, such as the communities they are part of, pose new challenges."}, {"heading": "3. Language and Social Identity", "text": "Speakers use language to construct their social identity [31]. Being involved in communicative exchange can be functional for the transfer of information, but at the same it functions as a staged performance in which users select specific codes (e.g., language, dialect, style [264]) that shape their communication. Consciously or unconsciously speakers adjust their performance to the specific social context and to the impression they intend to make on their audience. Each speaker has a personal linguistic repertoire to draw linguistic elements or codes from. Selecting from the repertoire is partially subject to \u2019identitywork\u2019, referring to the range of activities that individuals engage in to create, present, and sustain personal identities that are congruent with and supportive of the self-concept [237].\nLanguage is one of the instruments that speakers use in shaping their identities, but there are limitations (e.g. physical or genetic constraints) to the variation that can be achieved. For example, somebody with a smoker\u2019s voice will not be able to speak with clear voice but many individual characteristics still leave room for variation. Although traditionally attributed an absolute status, personal features (e.g., age and gender) are increasingly considered social rather than biological variables. Within sociolinguistics, a major thrust of research is to uncover the relation between social variables (e.g., gender, age, ethnicity, status) and language use [62, 64, 120, 262].\nBy recognizing that language use can reveal social patterns, many studies in computational linguistics have focused on automatically inferring social variables from text. This task can be seen as a form of automatic metadata detection that can provide information on author features. The growing interest in trend analysis tools is one of the drivers for the interest in the development and refinement of algorithms for this type of metadata detection. However, tasks such as gender and age prediction do not only appeal to researchers and developers of trend mining tools. Various public demos have been able to attract the attention of the general public (e.g., TweetGenie2 [188] and Gender Guesser3), which can be attributed to widespread interest in the entertaining dimension of the linguistic dimension of identity work. The automatic prediction of individual features such as age and gender based on only text are nontrivial tasks. Studies that have compared the performance of humans with that of automatic systems for gender and age prediction based on text alone found that automatic systems perform better than humans [33, 186]. A system based on aggregating guesses from a large number of people still predicted gender incorrectly for 16% of the Twitter users [187]. While most studies use a supervised learning approach, a recent study explored a lightly supervised approach using soft constraints such as derived from Census data (e.g., the proportion of people below or above 25 years in a county) [5].\nThis section will first focus on the datasets that have been used to investigate social identity and language variation in computational linguistics (Subsection 3.1). In the subsections 3.2-3.4 an overview will be presented about computational studies of language variation based on gender, age and geographical location. These three variables have received the most attention in computational linguistics, compared to other variables such as ethnicity [5, 201, 221] and social class. While many studies have focused on individual social variables, these variables are not independent. For example, there are indications that linguistic features that are used more by males\n2 http://www.tweetgenie.nl 3 http://www.hackerfactor.com/GenderGuesser.php\nincrease in frequency with age as well [7]. As another example, some studies have suggested that language variation across gender tends to be stronger among younger people and tends to fade away with older ages [18]. Eckert notes that the appropriate age for cultural events often differs for males and females [62], which could influence language variation patterns. The interaction between these variables is complicated by the fact that in many uncontrolled settings the gender distribution may not be equal for different age ranges (as observed in blogs [32] and Twitter [186]). Therefore, failing to control for gender while studying age (and vice versa) can lead to misinterpretation of the findings. We conclude with a discussion of how various NLP tasks, such as sentiment detection, can be improved by accounting for linguistic variation related to the social identity of speakers (Subsection 3.5)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Data Sources", "text": "Early computational studies on social variables and language use were based on formal texts, such as the British National Corpus [6, 145], or datasets collected from controlled settings, such as recorded conversations [236] and telephone conversations [27, 81, 258] where protocols were used to coordinate the conversations (such as topic selection). With the advent of social media, a shift is observed towards more informal texts collected from uncontrolled settings. Much of the initial work in this domain focused on blogs. The Blog Authorship Corpus [231], collected in 2004 from blogger.com data, has been used in various studies on gender and age [7, 84, 93, 185, 227]. Others have created their own blog corpus from various sources including LiveJournal and Xanga [32, 179, 192, 225, 228, 274].\nMore recent studies are focusing on Twitter data, which contains richer interactions in comparison to blogs. Burger et al. [33] created a large corpus by following links to blogs that contained author information provided by the authors themselves. The dataset has been used in various subsequent studies [22, 258, 259]. Others created their own Twitter dataset [69, 142, 158, 220, 276]. While early studies focused on English, recent studies have studied non-English Twitter data as well (Dutch [186], Spanish and Russian [259], and Japanese, Indonesian, Turkish, and French [40]). Besides blogs and Twitter, other web sources have been explored, including LinkedIn [142], IMDB [194], YouTube [77], e-mails [44], a Belgian social network site [198] and Facebook [221, 227, 233].\nTwo aspects can be distinguished that are often involved in the process of creating datasets to study the relation between social variables and language use.\nLabeling. Datasets derived from uncontrolled settings such as social media often lack explicit information regarding the identity of users, such as their gender, age or location. Researchers have used different strategies to acquire adequate labels:\n\u2022 User-provided information. Many researchers deploy information provided by the social media users themselves, for example based on explicit fields in user profiles [33, 231, 274], or by searching for specific patterns (e.g., birthday announcements [276]). While this information is probably highly accurate, such information is often only available for a small set of users (e.g., for age, 0.75% on Twitter [158] and 55% in blogs [32]). Locations of users have been derived based on geotagged messages [68] or locations in user profiles [178].\n\u2022 Manual annotation. Another option is manual annotation based on personal information revealed in the text, profile information, and public information on other social media sites [40, 186]. In the manual annotation scenario, a random set of authors is annotated; however, the required effort is much higher resulting in smaller datasets and biases of the annotators themselves might influence the annotation process. Furthermore, for some users not enough information may be available to even manually assign labels.\n\u2022 Exploiting names. Some labels can be automatically extracted based on the name of a user. For example, gender information for names can be derived from census information from the US Social Security Administration [17, 212], or from Facebook data [79]. In some languages, such as Russian, the morphology of the names can also be used to collect gender labels [259]. However, users who do not provide their names, or have uncommon names, will remain unlabeled. In addition, acquiring labels this way has not been well studied yet for other languages and cultures and for other type of labels (such as geographical location or age).\nSample selection. In many cases, it is necessary to limit the study to a sample of persons. Sometimes the selected sample is directly related to how labels are obtained, for example by only including people that explicitly list their gender or age in their social media profile [33], who have a gender specific first name [17], or who have geotagged tweets [68]. Others have used random sampling, or as random as possible due to restrictions of targeting a specific language [186]. However, in these cases the labels may not be readily available which increases the annotation effort (e.g., annotators need to manually go through the texts or inspect external websites to derive the gender or age). Another approach is focused sampling, for example by starting with social media accounts related to gender-specific behavior (e.g., male/female hygiene products, sororities) [220]. However, such an approach has the danger of creating biased datasets, which could influence the prediction performance numbers [42]."}, {"heading": "3.2 Gender", "text": "The study of gender and language variation has received much attention in sociolinguistics [64, 120]. Various studies have highlighted gender differences. According to Tannen [250], women engage more in \u2018rapport\u2019 talk, focusing on establishing connections, while men engage more in \u2019report\u2019 talk, focusing on exchanging information. Similarly, according to Holmes [118], in women\u2019s communication the social function of language is more salient, while in men\u2019s communication the referential function (conveying information) tends to be dominant. Argamon et al. [6] make a distinction between involvedness (more associated with women) and informational (more associated with men). However, with the increasing view that speakers use language to construct their identity, such generalizations have also been met with great criticism. Many of these studies rely on small sample sizes, ignore other variables (such as ethnicity, social class) and the many similarities between genders. Such generalizations contribute to stereotypes and the view of gender as an inherent property.\n3.2.1 Modeling Gender. Within computational linguistics, researchers have focused primarily on automatic gender classification based on text. Gender is then treated as\na binary variable based on biological characteristics, resulting in a binary classification task. A variety of machine learning methods have been explored, including SVMs [27, 40, 44, 79, 84, 179, 192, 198, 220, 276], Logistic Regression [22, 194], Naive Bayes [93, 179, 274] and the Winnow algorithm [33, 231]. However, treating gender as a binary variable based on biological characteristics assumes that gender is fixed and is something people have, instead of something people do [34], i.e., such a setup neglects the agency of speakers. Many sociolinguists, together with scholars from a variety of other disciplines such as the social sciences, view gender as a social construct, emphasizing that gendered behavior is a result of social conventions rather than inherent biological characteristics.\n3.2.2 Features and Patterns. Rather than focusing on the underlying machine learning models, most studies have focused on developing predictive features. Token-level and character-level unigrams and n-grams have been explored in various studies [17, 33, 79, 228, 274]. Sarawgi et al. [228] found character-level language models to be more robust than token-level language models. Grouping words by meaningful classes could improve interpretation and possibly performance of the models. LIWC [202], a word counting program based on manually defined dictionaries, has been used in experiments on Twitter data [79] and blogs [192, 231]. However, models based on LIWC alone tend to perform worse than unigram/ngram models [79, 192]. By analyzing the developed features, these studies have shown thatmales tend to usemore numbers [17], technology words [17] and URLs [231, 186], while females use more terms referring to family and relation issues [27].\nVarious features based on grammatical structure have been explored, including features capturing individual POS frequencies [6, 194] as well as POS patterns [6, 8, 17, 231]. Males tend to use more prepositions [7, 8, 194, 231] and more articles [7, 192, 194, 231, 233], however Bamman et al. [17] did not find these to be significant in their Twitter study. Females tend to use more pronouns [6, 7, 8, 17, 194, 231, 233] (in particular first person singular [186, 194, 233]). Ameasure introduced by Heylighen and Dewaele [114] to measure formality based on the frequencies of different word classes has been used in experiments on blogs [179, 193]. Sarawgi et al. [228] experimented with probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs). In some languages such as French, the gender of nouns (including the speaker) is often marked in the syntax. For example, a male would say \u2019je suis all\u00e9\u2019, while a female would say \u2019je suis all\u00e9e\u2019 (\u2018I went\u2019). By detecting such \u2019je suis\u2019 constructions, Ciot et al. [40] improved performance of gender classification in French.\nStylistic features have been widely explored as well. Studies have reported that males tend to use longer words, sentences and texts [93, 194, 236] andmore swear words [27, 233]. Females use more emotion words [17, 192, 233], emoticons [17, 84, 220, 259], and CMC words like omg and lol [17, 231].\nGroups can be characterized by their attributes, for example females tend to have maiden names. Bergsma and Van Durme [22] used such distinguishing attributes, extracted from common nouns for males and females (e.g., granny, waitress), to improve classification performance. Features based on first names have also been explored. Although not revealing much about language use itself, they can improve prediction performance [22, 33, 221].\nGenre. So far, not many studies have analyzed the influence of genre and domain [153] on language use, but a better understanding will aid the interpretation of observed language variation patterns. Using data from the British National Corpus, Argamon\net al. [6] found a strong correlation between characteristics of male and non-fiction writing and likewise, between female and fiction writing. Based on this observation, they trained separate prediction models for fiction and non-fiction [145]. Building on these findings, Herring et al. [111] investigated whether gender differences would still be observed when controlling for genre in blogs. They did not find a significant relation between gender and previously identified gender features, however the study was based on a relatively small sample.\nStudies focusing on gender prediction have tested the generalizability of gender prediction models by training and testing on different datasets. Although models tend to perform worse when tested on a different dataset than the one used for training, studies have shown that prediction performance is still higher than random, suggesting that there are indeed gender-specific patterns of language variation that go beyond genre and domain [227, 228]. Gianfortoni et al. [84] proposed the use of \u2019stretchy patterns\u2019, flexible sequences of categories, to model stylistic variation and to improve generalizability across domains.\nSocial Interaction. Most computational studies on gender-specific patterns in language use have studied speakers in isolation. As the conversational partner4 or social network of speakers influence the language use of speakers, several studies have extended their focus by also considering contextual factors. For example, this led to the finding that speakers use more gender-specific language in same-gender conversations [27]. On the Fisher and Switchboard corpus (telephone conversations), classifiers dependent on the gender of the conversation partner improve performance [81]. However, exploiting the social network of speakers on Twitter has been less effective so far. Features derived from the friends of Twitter users did not improve gender classification (but it was effective for age) [276]. Likewise, Bamman et al. [17] found that social network information of Twitter users did not improve gender classification when enough text was available.\nNot all computational studies on gender in interaction contexts have focused on gender classification itself. Some have used gender as a variable when studying other phenomena. In a study on language and power, Prabhakaran et al. [212] showed how the gender composition of a group influenced how power is manifested in the Enron corpus. In a study on language change in online communities, Hemphill and Otterbacher [108] found that females write more like men over time in the IMDb community (a movie review site), which they explain by men receiving more prestige in the community. Jurafsky et al. [136] automatically classified speakers according to interactional style (awkward, friendly, or flirtatious) using various types of features, including lexical features based on LIWC [202], prosodic, and discourse features. Differences, as well as commonalities, were observed between genders, and incorporating features from both speakers improved classification performance.\n3.2.3 Interpretation of Findings.As mentioned before, most computational approaches adopt a simplistic view of gender as an inherent property based on biological characteristics. Only recently, the computational linguistics community has noticed the limitations of this simplistic view by acknowledging the agency of speakers. Two of these studies based their argumentation on an analysis of the social networks of the users. Automatic gender predictions on YouTube data correlated more strongly with\n4 An individual who participates in a conversation, sometimes also referred to as interlocutor and addressee\nthe dominant gender in a user\u2019s network than the user-reported gender [77]. Likewise, in experiments by Bamman et al. [17] incorrectly labeled Twitter users also had have fewer same-gender connections. In addition, clusters were identified of users who used linguistic markers that conflicted with general population-level findings. Another study was based on data collected from an online game [187]. Thousands of players guessed the age and gender of Twitter users based on their tweets, and the results revealed that many Twitter users do not tweet in a gender stereotypical way.\nThus, language is inherently social and while certain language features are on average used more by males or females, individual speakers may diverge from the stereotypical images that tend to be highlighted by many studies. In addition, gender is shaped differently depending on the culture and language, and thus presenting gender as a universal social variable can bemisleading. Furthermore, linguistic variationwithin speakers of the same gender holds true as well."}, {"heading": "3.3 Age", "text": "Aging is a universal phenomenon and understanding the relation between language and age can provide interesting insights in many ways. An individual at a specific time represents both a place in history as well as a life stage [62], and thus observed patterns can generate new insights into language change as well as how individuals change their language use as they move through life. Within computational linguistics, fewer studies have focused on language variation according to age compared to studies focusing on gender, possibly because obtaining age labels requires more effort than gender labels (e.g., the gender of people can often be derived from their names; cf. Section 3.1). Most of these studies have focused on absolute chronological age, although age can also be seen as a social variable like gender.\nSociolinguistic studies have found that adolescents use the most non-standard forms, because at young age the group pressure to not conform to established societal conventions is the largest [62, 119]. In contrast, adults are found to use themost standard language, because for them social advancementmatters and they use standard language to be taken seriously [20, 62]. These insights can explainwhy predicting the ages of older people is harder (e.g., distinguishing between a 15 and a 20 year old person based on their language use is easier than distinguishing between a 40 and 45 years old person) [186, 187].\n3.3.1ModelingAge.A fundamental question is how to model age, and so far researchers have not reached a consensus yet. Eckert [62] distinguishes between chronological age (number of years since birth), biological age (physical maturity) and social age (based on life events). Speakers are often grouped according their age, because the amount of data is in many cases not sufficient to make more fine-grained distinctions [62]. Most studies consider chronological age and group speakers based on age spans [18, 148, 254]. However, chronological age can be misleading since persons with the same chronological age may have had very different life experiences. Another approach is to group speakers according to \u2018shared experiences of time\u2019 (e.g., high school students) [62].\nWithin computational linguistics the most common approach is to model agespecific language use based on the chronological age of speakers (except Nguyen et al. [186] who have explored the option of classification into life stages). However, even when focusing on chronological age, the task can be framed in different ways as well. Chronological age prediction has mostly been approached as a classification problem, modeling the chronological age as a categorical variable. Based on this task formulation,\nvarious classical machine learning models have been used, such as SVMs [198, 220], logistic regression [186, 225] and Naive Bayes [249].\nThe boundaries used for discretizing age have varied depending on the dataset and experimental setup. Experiments on the blog authorship corpus [231] used categories based on the following age spans: 13-17, 23-27, and 33-47, removing the age ranges in between to simplify the task. Rangel et al. [218] adopted this approach in the Author Profiling task at PAN 2013. The following year, the difficulty of the task at PAN 2014 was increased by considering the more fine-grained categories of 18-24, 25-34, 35-49, 50- 64 and 65+ [219]. Zamal et al. [276] classified Twitter users into 18-23 and 25-30. Other studies explored boundaries at 30 [220], at 20 and 40 [186], at 40 [81] and at 18 [32].\nIn several studies experiments have been done by varying the classification boundaries. Peersman et al. [198] experimented with binary classification and boundaries at 16, 18 and 25. Tam andMartell [249] experimentedwith classifying teens versus 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and adults. Not surprisingly, in both studies a higher performancewas obtained when using larger age gaps (e.g., teens versus 40s/50s) than when using smaller age gaps (e.g., teens versus 20s/30s) [198, 249]. Rosenthal and McKeown [225] explored a range of splits to study differences in performance when predicting the birth year of blog authors. They related their findings to pre- and post social media generations.\nFor many applications, modeling age as a categorical variable might be sufficient. However, it does have several limitations. First, selecting age boundaries has proven to be difficult. It is not always clear which categories aremeaningful. Secondly, researchers have used different categories depending on the age distribution of their dataset which makes it difficult to make comparisons across datasets.\nMotivated by such limitations, recent studies havemodeled age as a continuous variable removing the need to define age categories. Framing age prediction as a regression task, a frequently used method has been linear regression [185, 186, 227, 233]. Liao et al. [158] experimented with a latent variable model that jointly models age and topics. In their model, age-specific topics obtain low standard deviations of age, while more general topics obtain high standard deviations.\n3.3.2 Features and Patterns. The majority of studies on age prediction have focused on identifying predictive features.While some features tend to be effective across domains, others are domain specific [185]. Features that characterizemale speech have been found to also increase with age [7], thus simply said, males tend to sound older than they are.\nUnigrams alone already perform well [185, 186, 198]. Features based on part of speech are effective as well. For example, younger people tend to use more first and second person singular pronouns (e.g., I, you), while older people more often use first person plural pronouns (e.g.,we) [18, 186, 225]. Older people also use more prepositions [8, 186], determiners [8, 185] and articles [233]. Most of these studies focused on English and therefore some of these findings might not hold in other languages (for example, some languages do not have pronouns).\nVarious studies have found that younger people use less standard language. They use more alphabetical lengthening (e.g., niiiice) [186, 220], more contractions without apostrophes (e.g., dont) [8], more Internet acronyms (e.g., lol) [225], more slang [18, 225], more swear words [18, 185], and more capitalized words (e.g., HAHA) [186, 225]. Specific words such as like are also highly associated with younger ages [18, 185]. Younger people also use more features that indicate stance and emotional involvement [18], such as intensifiers [18, 186] and emoticons [225]. Younger people also use shorter words and sentences and write shorter tweets [32, 186, 225].\n3.3.3 Interpretation of Findings. Age prediction experiments are usually done on datasets collected at a specific point in time. Based on such datasets, language use is modeled and compared between users with different ages. Features that are found to be predictive or that correlate highly with age are used to highlight how differently \u2019younger\u2019 and \u2019older\u2019 people talk or write. However, the observed differences in language use based on such datasets could be explained in multiple ways. Linguistic variation can occur as an individual moves through life (age grading), and in that case the same trend is observed for individuals at different time periods. Linguistic variation can also be a result of changes in the community itself as it moves through time (generational change) [20, 226]. For example, suppose we observe that younger Twitter users include more smilies in their tweets. This could indicate that smiley usage is higher at younger ages, but that when Twitter users grow older they decrease their usage of smileys. However, this could also indicate a difference in smiley usage in generations (i.e. the generation of the current younger Twitter users use more smileys compared to the generation of the older Twitter users). This also points to the relation between synchronic variation and diachronic change. Synchronic variation is variation across different speakers or speech communities at a particular point in time, while diachronic change is accumulation of synchronic variation in time and frequency. In order for a change to be effective, synchronic variations should increase their frequency over time. To have a better understanding of change, we need to understand the spread of variation across time and amount. As is the case for gender, age can be considered a social variable and thus when only modeling chronological age, we are ignoring the agency of speakers and that speakers follow different trajectories in their lives."}, {"heading": "3.4 Location", "text": "Regional variation has been extensively studied in sociolinguistics and related areas such as dialectology [38] and dialectometry [270]. The use of certainwords, grammatical constructions, or the pronunciation of a word, can often reveal where a speaker is from. For example, \u2018yinz\u2019 (a form of the second-person pronoun) is mostly used around Pittsburgh, which can be observed on Twitter as well [67]. Dialectology traditionally focuses on the geographical distribution of individual or small sets of linguistic variables [38]. A typical approach involves identifying and plotting isoglosses, lines that divide maps into regions where specific values of the variable predominate. The next step involves identifying bundles of isoglosses, often followed by the identification of dialect regions. While these steps have usually been donemanually, recently Grieve et al. [99] illustrated how statistical methods can be used for automating such an analysis.\nThe study of regional variation is perhaps one of the main areas within sociolinguistics that has been heavily influenced by new statistical approaches, such as from computational linguistics, machine learning and spatial analysis. A separate branch, dialectometry [270], has emerged. In contrast to dialectology which involves individual linguistic variables, dialectometry involves aggregating linguistic variables to examine linguistic differences between regions. This aggregation step led to the introduction of various statistical methods, including clustering, dimensionality reduction techniques and regression approaches [106, 182, 269]. Recently, researchers within dialectometry have explored the automatic identification of characteristic features of dialect regions [269], a task which aligns more closely with the approaches taken by dialectologists.\nWhile the datasets typically used in dialectology and dialectometry studies are still small compared to datasets used in computational linguistics, similar statistical\nmethods have been explored. This has created a promising starting point for closer collaboration with computational linguistics.\n3.4.1 Modeling Regional Dialects. Within CL, we find two lines of work on computationally modeling dialects.\nSupervised. The first approach starts with documents labeled according to their dialect, which can be seen as a supervised learning approach.Most studies taking this approach focus on automatic dialect identification, which is a variation of automatic language identification, a well-studied research topic within the field of computational linguistics [13, 128], that started in the 1960s with work by Gold [91]. While some have considered automatic language identification a solved problem [168], still many outstanding issues exist [128], including the identification of dialects and closely related languages. In studies of automatic dialect identification, various dialects have been explored including Arabic [54, 74, 275], Turkish [59], English [160], Swiss German [230] and Dutch [253] dialects.\nUnsupervised. An alternative approach is to start with location-tagged data to automatically identify dialect regions. While the models are given labels indicating the locations of speakers, the dialect labels themselves are not observed. In the context of modeling dialects, we consider it an unsupervised approach (although it can be considered a supervised approachwhen the task is framed as a location prediction task). Themajority of the work in this area has used Twitter data, because it contains fine-grained location information in the form of GPS data for tweets, or user-provided locations in user profiles.\nMuch of the research that starts with location-tagged data is done with the aim of automatically predicting the location of speakers. The setup is thus similar to the setup for the other tasks that we have surveyed in this section (e.g., gender and age prediction). Eisenstein et al. [68] developed a topic model to identify geographically coherent linguistic regions and words that are highly associated with these regions. The model was tested by predicting the locations of Twitter users based on their tweets. While the topic of text-based location prediction has received increasing attention [104, 271], using these models for the discovery of new sociolinguistic patterns is an option that has not been fully explored yet since most studies primarily focus on prediction performance.\nVarious approaches have been explored to model the location of speakers, an aspect that is essential in many of the studies that start with location-tagged data. In Wing and Baldridge [271], locations are modeled using geodesic grids, but these grids do not always correspond to administrative or language boundaries. Users can also be grouped based on cities [104], but such an approach is not suitable for users in rural areas or when the focus is on more-fine grained geographical variation (e.g., within a city). Eisenstein et al. [68] model regions using Gaussian distributions, but only focused on the United States and thus more research is needed to investigate the suitability of this approach when considering other countries or larger regions.\n3.4.2 Features and Patterns. Word and character n-gram models have been frequently used in dialect identification [140, 160, 253, 275]. Similarly, many text-based location prediction systems make use of unigram word features [68, 104, 271].\nFeatures inspired by sociolinguistics could potentially improve performance. Darwish et al. [54] showed that for identifying Arabic dialects a better classification perfor-\nmance could be obtained by incorporating known lexical, morphological and phonological differences in their model. Scherrer and Rambow [230] also found that using linguistic knowledge improves over an n-gram approach. Their method is based on a linguistic atlas for the extraction of lexical, morphological and phonetic rules and the likelihood of these forms across German-speaking Switzerland. Dog\u0306ru\u00f6z and Nakov [59] explored the use of light verb constructions to distinguish between two Turkish dialects.\nTo support the discovery of new sociolinguistic patterns and to improve prediction performance, several studies have focused on automatically identifying characteristic features of dialects. Han et al. [104] explored various feature selection methods to improve location prediction and the selected features may reflect dialectal variation but this was not the focus of the study. The method by Prokic\u0301 et al. [214] was based on in-group and out-group comparisons based on data in which linguistic varieties were already grouped (e.g., based on clustering). Peirsman et al. [199] compared frequencybased measures, such as chi-square and log-likelihood tests with distributional methods. Automatic methods may identify many features that vary geographically such as topic words and named entities, and an open challenge is to separate this type of variation from the more sociolinguistically interesting variations. For example, the observation that the word \u2018beach\u2019 is used more often near coastal areas or that \u2018Times Square\u2019 is used more often in New York is not interesting from the perspective of a sociolinguist.\nMaking use of location-tagged data, several studies have focused on analyzing patterns of regional variation. Doyle [60] analyzed the geographical distribution of dialectal variants (e.g., the use of doublemodals like \u2018might could\u2019) based on Twitter data, and compared it with traditional sociolinguistic data collection methods. Starting with a query-based approach, he uses baseline queries (e.g., \u2018I\u2019) for estimating a conditional distribution of data given metadata. His approach achieved high correlations with data from sociolinguistic studies. J\u00f8rgensen et al. [132] studied the use of three phonological features of African American Vernacular English using manually selected word pairs. The occurrence of the features were correlated with location data (longitude and latitude) as well as demographic information obtained from the US census bureau. While these approaches start with attested dialect variants, automatic discovery of unknown variation patterns could potentially lead to even more interesting results. To study how a word\u2019s meaning varies geographically, Bamman et al. [16] extended the skip gram model by Mikolov et al. [171] by adding contextual variables that represent states from the US. The model then learns a global embedding matrix and additional matrices for each context (i.e. state) to capture the variation of a word\u2019s meaning.\nThe increasing availability of longitudinal data has made it possible to study the spreading of linguistic innovations geographically and over time on a large scale. A study by Eisenstein et al. [70] based on tweets in the United States indicates that linguistic innovations spread through demographically similar areas, in particular with regard to race.\n3.4.3 Interpretation of Findings. Labeling texts by dialect presumes that there are clear boundaries between dialects. However, it is not easy to make absolute distinctions between language varieties (e.g., languages, dialects). Chambers and Trudgill [38] illustrates this with the example of traveling from village to village. Speakers from villages at larger distances have more difficulty understanding each other compared to villages that are closer to each other, but there is no clear-cut distance at which speakers are no longer mutually intelligible. Besides linguistic differences, boundaries between\nlanguage varieties are often influenced by other factors including political boundaries [38]. Therefore, deciding on the appropriate labels to describe linguistic communication across different groups of speakers (in terms of language, dialect, minority language, regional variety, etc.) is an on-going issue of debate. The arbitrariness of the distinction between a language and dialect is captured with the popular expression \"A language is a dialect with an army and navy\" [1]. Methods that do not presume clear dialect boundaries are therefore a promising alternative. However, such methods then rely on location-tagged data, which is usually only available for a portion of the data."}, {"heading": "3.5 Text Classification Informed by Identity Information", "text": "So far we have focused on automatically predicting the variables themselves (e.g., gender, age, location) but linguistic variation related to the identity of speakers can also be used to improve various other NLP tasks. Dadvar et al. [46] trained gender-specific classifiers to detect instances of cyberbullying, noticing that language used by harassers varies by gender. To improve the prediction performance of detecting the power direction between participants in emails, Prabhakaran et al. [212] incorporated the gender of participants in e-mail conversations and the overall \u2019gender environment\u2019 as features in their model. Volkova et al. [259] studied gender differences in the use of subjective language on Twitter. Representing gender as a binary feature was not effective, but the use of features based on gender-dependent sentiment terms improved subjectivity and polarity classification. Hovy [121] found that training gender or age-specific word embeddings improved tasks such as sentiment analysis and topic classification."}, {"heading": "4. Language and Social Interaction", "text": "In the previous section we explored computational approaches to study how language is shaping our identity. We discussed variables such as gender, age and geographical location, thereby focusing on variation between speakers. However, speakers do not act in isolation, but they are part of pairs, groups and communities. Therefore, there is also much variation within individual speakers, as language also varies according to the context, including the addressee or audience, topic, and social goals of the speakers. The variation that is related to the context of interaction will be the focus of this section.\nWe start this section with a discussion of data sources for large-scale analyses of language use in pairs, groups and communities (Section 4.1). Next, we discuss computational approaches to studying how language is reflecting and shaping our social relationships (Section 4.2). Much of this work has revolved around the role of language in power dynamics by studying how speakers use language to maintain and change power relations [75]. We will continue with a discussion on style-shifting (i.e., the use of different styles by a single speaker) in Section 4.3. We will discuss two prominent frameworks within sociolinguistics (Audience Design [19] and Communication Accommodation Theory [89]), and discuss how these frameworks have been studied within the computational linguistics community. Finally, we move our focus to the community level and discuss computational studies on how members adapt their language to their community and how this leads to language change over time (Section 4.4)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Data Sources", "text": "Many of the types of data that are relevant for the investigation of concepts of social identity, are also relevant for work on communication dynamics in pairs, groups and\ncommunities. The availability of detailed interaction recordings in online data has driven and enabled much of the work on this topic within computational linguistics. A variety of online discussion forums have been analyzed, including online cancer support communities [184, 263] and even a street gang forum [204]. Review sites, such as TripAdvisor [170], IMDb [108] and beer review communities [52], have also been used in studies on language in online communities. The Enron email corpus features in analyses of power relationships [56, 85, 208, 212], since Enron\u2019s organizational structure is known and can be integrated in studies on hierarchical power. For studies that involve more dynamic notions of power (e.g., identifying individuals who are pursuing power), other resources have also been explored, including Wikipedia Talk Pages [21, 28, 50, 246], transcripts of political debates [210, 211] and transcripts of Supreme Court arguments [50]."}, {"heading": "4.2 Shaping Social Relationships", "text": "Language is not only a means to exchange information but also contributes to the performance of action within interaction. Language serves simultaneously as a reflection of the relative positioning of speakers to their conversation partners as well as actions that accompany those positions [222]. At a conceptual level, this work draws heavily from a foundation in linguistic pragmatics [98, 155] as well as sociological theories of discourse [83, 251]. Concepts related to expectations or norms that provide the foundation for claiming such positions may be described from a philosophical perspective or a sociological one [206]. In viewing interaction as providing a context in which information and action may flow towards the accomplishment of social goals, speakers position themselves and others as sources or recipients of such information and action [165]. When performatives break norms related to social positions, they have implications for relational constructs such as politeness [30], which codifies rhetorical strategies for acknowledging and managing relational expectations while seeking to accomplish extra-relational goals. In the remaining part of this section, we focus on computational studies within this theme. We first discuss the general topic of automatic extraction of social relationships from text, and then focus on power and politeness.\nAutomatic Extraction of Social Relationships. Recognizing that language use may reveal cues about social relationships, studies within CL have explored the automatic extraction of different types of social relationships based on text. One distinction that has been made is between weak ties (e.g., acquaintances) and strong ties (e.g., family and close friends) [96]. Gilbert and Karahalios [86] explored how different types of information (including messages posted) can be used to predict tie strength on Facebook. In this study, the predictions were done for ties within a selected sample. Bak et al. [12] studied differences in self-disclosure on Twitter between strong and weak ties using automatically identified topics. Twitter users disclose more personal information to strong ties, but they show more positive sentiment towards weak ties, which may explained by social norms regarding first-time acquaintances on Twitter.\nOther studies have automatically extracted social relationships frommore extensive datasets, enabling analyses of the extracted network structures. These studies have focused on extracting signed social networks, i.e., networks with positive and negative edges, for example based on positive and negative affinity between individuals or formal and informal relationships. Work within this area has drawn from Structural Balance Theory [107], which captures intuitions such as that when two individuals have a mutual friend, they are likely to be friends as well, and from Status Theory [154],\nwhich involves edges that are directed and reflect status differences. Hassan et al. [105] developed amachine learning classifier to extract signed social networks and found that the extracted network structuremostly agreedwith Structural Balance Theory. Krishnan and Eisenstein [147] proposed an unsupervised model for extraction of signed social networks which they used to extract formal and informal relations in a movie-script corpus. Furthermore, their model also induced the social function of address terms (e.g., dude). West et al. [268] focused on predicting the sentiment between individuals. The task was formulated as an optimization problem in which they combined the costs calculated based on an sentiment analysis model and based on Status and Structural Balance Theory.\nPower. Work on power relations draws from social psychological concepts of relative power in social situations [101], in particular aspects of relative power that operate at the level of individuals in relation to specific others within groups or communities. Relative power may be thought of as operating in terms of horizontal positioning or vertical positioning: Horizontal positioning relates to closeness and related constructs such as positive regard, trust and commitment, while vertical positioning relates to authority and related constructs such as approval and respect among individuals within communities. Within the areas of linguistics and computational linguistics, investigations have focused on how speakers use language to maintain and change power relations [75].\nWithin computational linguistics, much of this work has focused on automatically identifying power relationships from text. Usually this task is framed as a classification task. Earlier studies have focused on hierarchical power relations based on the organizational structure, thereby frequently making use of the Enron corpus. Bramsen et al. [29] extracted messages between pairs of participants and developed a machine learning classifier to automatically determine whether the messages of an author were UpSpeak (directed towards a person of higher status) or DownSpeak (directed towards a person of lower status). With a slightly different formulation of the task, Gilbert [85] used logistic regression to classify power relationships in the Enron corpus and identified the most predictive phrases. Besides formulating the task as a classification task, ranking approaches have been explored as well [56, 190, 210]. For example, Prabhakaran et al. [210] predicted the ranking of participants in political debates according to their relative poll standings.\nStudies based on external power structures, such as the organizational structure of a company, treat power relations as static. Recent studies have adopted more dynamic notions of power. For example, Prabhakaran et al. [208] discusses a setting with an employee in a Human Resources department who interacts with an office manager. The HR employee has power over the office manager when the situation is about enforcing a HR policy, but the power relation will be reversed when the topic is allocation of new office space. In their study using the Enron corpus, they compared manual annotations of situational power with the organization hierarchy and found that these were not well aligned. Other studies have focused on identifying persons who are pursuing power [28, 246], detecting influencers [24, 126, 190, 215], and studying how language use changes when users change their status in online communities [50].\nDepending on the type of power and the used dataset, labels for the relations or roles of individuals have been collected in different ways, such as based on the organizational structure of Enron [29, 85], the number of followers in Twitter [49], standings in state and national polls to study power in political debates [210], admins and nonadmins in Wikipedia [21, 50] and manual annotation [24, 190, 207].\nMany computational approaches within this sphere build on a foundation from pragmatics related to speech act theory [10, 235], which has most commonly been represented in what are typically referred to as conversation, dialog or social acts [21, 76]. Such categories can also be combined into sequences [28]. Other specialized representations are also used, such as features related to turn taking style [210, 246], topic control [190, 211, 245], and \u2019overt displays of power\u2019, which Prabhakaran et al. [209] define as utterances that constrain the addressee\u2019s actions beyond what the underlying dialog act imposes.\nPoliteness. Polite behavior contributes to maintaining social harmony and avoiding social conflict [119]. Automatic classifiers to detect politeness have been developed to study politeness strategies on a large scale. According to politeness theory by Brown and Levinson [30], three social factors influence linguistically polite behavior: social distance, relative power, and ranking of the imposition (i.e., cost of the request). Drawing from this theory, Peterson et al. [203] performed a study on the Enron corpus by training classifiers to automatically detect formality and requests. Emails that contained requests or that were sent to people of higher ranks indeed tended to be more formal. According to politeness theory, speakers with greater power than their addressees are expected to be less polite [30]. Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. [51] developed a politeness classifier and found that in Wikipedia polite editors were indeed more likely to achieve higher status, but once promoted, they became less polite. In StackExchange, a site with an explicit reputation system, users with higher reputation were less polite than users with low reputation. Their study also revealed new interactions between politeness markings (e.g., please) and morphosyntactic context."}, {"heading": "4.3 Style Shifting", "text": "According to Labov, there are no single-style speakers [149] since speakers may switch across styles (style-shifting) depending on their communication partners (e.g., addressee\u2019s age, gender and social background). Besides the addressee, other factors such as the topic (e.g., politics vs. religion) or the context (e.g., a courtroom vs. family dinner) can contribute to style shifting. In early studies Labov stated that \u2019styles can be arranged along a single dimension, measured by the amount of attention paid to speech\u2019 [149], which thus views style shifting as mainly something responsive. The work by Labov on style has been highly influential, but not everyone agreed with his explanation for different speech styles. We will discuss two theories (Communication Accommodation Theory andAudienceDesign) that have receivedmuch attention in both sociolinguistics and computational linguistics and that focus on the role of audiences and addressees on style. Even more recent theories are emphasizing the agency of speakers as they employ different styles to represent themselves in a certain way or initiate a change in the situation.\nCommunication Accommodation Theory. Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT) [88, 89, 239] seeks to explain why speakers accommodate5 to each other during conversations. Speakers can shift their behavior to become more similar (convergence) or more different (divergence) to their conversation partners. Convergence reduces the\n5 The phenomenon of adapting to the conversation partner has also been known as \u2018alignment\u2019, \u2018coordination\u2019 and \u2018entrainment\u2019\nsocial distance between speakers and converging speakers are often viewed as more favorably and cooperative. CAT has been developed in the 1970s and has its roots in the field of social psychology.While CAT has been studied extensively in controlled settings (e.g., [92]), only recently studies have been performed in uncontrolled settings such as Twitter conversations [49], online forums [131], Wikipedia Talk pages and Supreme Court arguments [50], and even movie scripts [48].\nSpeakers accommodate to each other on a variety of dimensions, ranging from pitch, and gestures, to the words that are used. Within computational linguistics, researchers have focused on measuring linguistic accommodation. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) has frequently been employed in these studies to capture stylistic accommodation, for example reflected in the use of pronouns [48, 49, 131, 191]. Speakers do not necessarily converge on all dimensions [89], which has also been observed on Twitter [49]. Although earlier studies used correlations of specific features between participants, on turn-level or overall conversation-level [156, 191, 234], these correlations fail to capture the temporal aspect of accommodation. The measure developed by Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. [49] is based on the increase in probability of a response containing a certain stylistic dimension given that the original message contains that specific stylistic dimension. Jones et al. [131] proposed a measure that takes into account that speakers differ in their tendency to accommodate to others, Jain et al. [130] used a Dynamic BayesianModel to study speech accommodation, andWang et al. [263] used a measure based on repetition of words (or syntactic structures) between target and prime posts.\nSocial roles and orientations taken up by speakers influence how conversations play out over time and computational approaches to measure accommodation have been used to study power dynamics [49, 50, 131]. In a study on power dynamics inWikipedia Talk pages and Supreme court debates, Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. [50] found that people with a lower status accommodated more than people with a higher status. In addition, users accommodated less once they became an admin in Wikipedia.\nAudience Design. In a classical study set in New Zealand, Alan Bell found that newsreaders used different styles depending on which radio station they were talking for, even when they were reporting the same news on the same day. Bell\u2019s audience design framework [19] explains style shifting as a response to audiences and shares similarities with CAT. One of the differences with CAT is that different types of audiences are defined from the perspective of the speaker (ranging from addressee to eavesdropper) and thus can also be applied to settings in which there is only a one-way interaction (such as broadcasting). Social media provides an interesting setting to study how audiences influence style. In many social media platforms, such as Twitter or Facebook, multiple audiences (e.g., friends, colleagues) are collapsed into a single context. Users of such platforms often imagine an audience when writing messages and they may target messages to different audiences [167].\nTwitter has been the focus of several recent large-scale studies on audience design. In a study on how audiences influence the use ofminority languages on Twitter, Nguyen et al. [189] showed how characteristics of the audience influence language choice on Twitter by analyzing tweets frommultilingual users in the Netherlands using automatic language identification. Tweets directed to larger audiences were more often written in Dutch, while within conversations users often switched to the minority language. In another study on audience on Twitter, Bamman and Smith [15] showed that incorporating features of the audience improved sarcasm detection. Furthermore, their results suggested that users tend to use the hashtag #sarcasm when they are less familiar with\ntheir audience. Pavalanathan and Eisenstein [197] studied two types of non-standard lexical variables: those strongly associated with specific geographical regions of the United States and variables that were frequently used in Twitter but considered nonstandard in other media. The use of non-standard lexical variables was inversely related to the size of the intended audiences. Furthermore, non-standard lexical variables were more often used in tweets addressed to individuals from the same metropolitan area. Using a different data source, Michael and Otterbacher [170] showed that reviewers on the TripAdvisor site adjust their style to the style of preceding reviews. Moreover, the extent to which reviewers are influenced correlates with attributes such as experience of the reviewer, or their sentiment towards the reviewed attraction."}, {"heading": "4.4 Community Dynamics", "text": "As we just discussed, people adapt their language use towards their conversation partner. Within communities norms emerge over time through interaction between members, such as slang words and domain-specific jargon [52, 184], or conventions for indicating retweets in Twitter [144]. Members of communities employ such markers to signal their affiliation. In an online gangs forum for example, graffiti style features were used to signal group affiliation [204]. To become a core member of a community, members adopt such community norms. As a result, often a change in behavior can be observed when someone joins a community. Multiple studies have reported that members of online communities decrease their use of first person singular pronouns (e.g., \u2018I\u2019) over time and increase their use of first person plural pronouns (e.g., \u2018we\u2019) [36, 52, 184], suggesting a stronger focus on the community. Thus, local accommodation effects are driving long-term language changes [150, 151]. Fine-grained, large-scale analyses of language change are difficult in offline settings, but the emergence of online communities has enabled computational approaches for analyzing language change within communities.\nEarly investigations of this topic were based on data from non-public communities, such as email exchanges between students during a course [206] and data from the Junior Summit \u201998, an online community with children from across the world to discuss global issues [36, 127]. In these communities, members joined at the same time. Furthermore, the studies were based on data spanning only several months.\nMore recent studies have used data from public, online communities, such as online forums and review sites. Data from these communities typically span longer time periods (e.g., multiple years). Members join these communities intermittently and thus, when new users join, community norms have already been established. Nguyen and Ros\u00e9 [184] analyzed an online breast cancer community, in which long-time members used forum-specific jargon, highly informal style, and showed familiarity and emotional involvement with other members. Time periods were represented by the distribution of high frequency words and measures such as Kullback-Leibler divergence were used to study how language changed over time. Members who joined the community showed increasing conformity to community norms during the first year of their participation. Based on these observations, a model was developed to determinemembership duration. Hemphill andOtterbacher [108] also studied howmembers adopt community norms over time but focused specifically on gender differences. They studied changes in the use of various characteristics, such as hedging, word/sentence complexity and vocabulary richness, on IMDb (the Internet Movie Database), a community in which males tend to receive higher prestige than females.\nNot only members change their behavior over time as they participate in a community, communities themselves are also constantly evolving as members join and leave. Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. [52] analyzed language change on both memberlevel and community-level in two beer review communities. Language models were created based on monthly snapshots to capture the linguistic state of a community over time. Cross-entropy was then used to measure how much a certain post deviated from a language model. Members in these communities turned out to follow a two-stage lifecycle: They first align with the language of the community (innovative learning phase), however at some point they stop adapting their language (conservative phase). The point at which members enter the conservative phase turned out to be dependent on how long a user would end up staying in the community.\nThese studies illustrate the potential of using large amounts of online data to study language change in communities in a quantitative manner, which was not possible in the past. Further research could focus on more in-depth analyses, for example by focusing on subcommunities within online communities or by incorporating more characteristics of the individual members into the analyses."}, {"heading": "5. Multilingualism and Social Interaction", "text": "Languages evolve due to interaction of speakers within and outside their speech communities. Within sociolinguistics, multilingual speakers and their speech communities have been studied widely with respect to the contexts and conditions of language mixing and switching. This section is dedicated to computational approaches for analyzing multilingual communication within the social and linguistic contexts. We first start with a brief introduction to multilingual communication from a sociolinguistic point of view. Later, we expand the discussion to analyzing multilingual communication using computational approaches.\nHuman mobility has always been the main reason for interaction among speakers of different languages. In 1953, Weinreich [266] was one of the first to explain why and how languages come into contact and evolve under each other\u2019s influence in a systematic manner. According to Thomason [252], social factors [23, 80] and the duration of contact could influence language contact and change more than the linguistic factors alone. At the linguistic level, language mixing (sometimes used interchangeably with code-switching) is the initial outcome of contact between languages and it usually starts with the borrowing of vocabulary. As the contact increases, underlying levels of grammar (e.g., morphology and syntax) are influenced and eventually change as well. Sociolinguists [9, 102, 181, 205] have studied various aspects of language contact and mixing across different contact settings.\nBoth language mixing and code-switching are used interchangeably and there is no consensus on the terminology. Each contact situation is unique and overpasses universal linguistic categories. The borders between language and dialect are fuzzy, because they are often determined by social and political factors rather than linguistic factors. Therefore, we use the term \u2019multilingual speaker\u2019 covering both language and/or dialect mixing.\nLanguage mixing refers to the mixing of languages within the same text or conversation [102]. The switching between languages can take place at various levels.Wei [265] refers to language alternations at or above the clause level (and calls it code-mixing). Romaine [224] differentiates between inter-sentential (i.e., across sentences) and intrasentential (i.e., within the same sentence) switches. Poplack et al. [205] acknowledge complete languages shifts of individual users as well (and call it code-switching). We\nuse the term language mixing for a continuum that starts with occasional switches (e.g., words or fixed multi-word expressions) and extends to grammatical changes at the underlying levels as the duration and intensity of contact between languages increase. When the frequency of switches increases (for individual speakers or for the community), these switches are regarded as borrowed/loan words (e.g., hip hop related Anglicisms in a German hip hop forum [82]). As the contact increases, underlying grammatical levels (e.g., morphology, syntax) are affected as well. Attesting the language change at the underlying levels is harder since these changes go beyond borrowed words [57, 58].\nEarlier studies of language mixing were mostly based on multilingual spoken data expressed in controlled or naturalistic settings [9, 180]. Nowadays, the wide-spread use of internet in multilingual populations provides ample opportunities for large-scale and in-depth analyses of mixed language use in online media [53, 115, 116, 195, 257]. Still most of these studies have focused on qualitative analyses of multilingual online communication with limited data in terms of size and duration.\nExample (1) illustrates switching between Turkish (TR) and Dutch (NL) in the same utterance in an online forum [196]. A Turkish-Dutch bilingual user starts the post in Dutch and switches to Turkish for the rest of the post.\nExample (1) <NL>vakantie boeken</NL> <TR> yaptim annecigimee </TR> Tra: \"<NL>booking a holiday </NL> <TR> for my mother</TR>\"\nThe rest of this section presents a discussion of data sources for studying multilingual communication on a large scale (Section 5.1). Consequently, we discuss research on adapting various NLP tools to process mixed-language texts (Section 5.2). We finalize this section with a discussion of studies that analyze, or even try to predict, the use of multiple languages in multilingual communication (Section 5.3)."}, {"heading": "5.1 Data Sources", "text": "In sociolinguistics, conversational data is usually collected by the researchers themselves, either among small groups of speakers at different times [58] or from the same group of speakers longitudinally [172, 255]. The manual transcription and annotation of data is time-intensive and costly. Multilingual data from online environments is usually extracted in small volumes and for short periods; automatic analysis of these data has been difficult for most languages, especially when resources or technical support are lacking.\nWithin computational linguistics, there is a growing interest in the automatic processing of mixed-language texts. Lui et al. [161] and Yamaguchi and Tanaka-Ishii [273] studied automatic language identification in mixed-language documents from Wikipedia by artificially concatenating texts from monolingual sources into multilingual documents. However, such approaches lead to artificial language boundaries. Most recently, social media (such as Facebook [261], Twitter [137, 200, 242] and online forums [183]) provide large volumes of data for analyzingmultilingual communication in social interaction. Transcriptions of conversations have been explored by Solorio and Liu [241], however their data was limited to three speakers. Language pairs that have been studied for multilingual communication include English-Hindi [261], Spanish-English [200, 240, 241], Turkish-Dutch [183], Mandarin-English [2, 200], and French-English [137]. Besides being a valuable resource for studies on multilingual social interaction,\nmultilingual texts in social media have also been used to improve general purpose machine translation systems [125, 159].\nProcessing and analyzing mixed-language data often requires identification of languages at the word level. Several datasets are publicly available to stimulate research on language identification in mixed-language texts, including data from the shared task on Language Identification in Code-Switched Data [242] covering four different language pairs on Twitter, romanized Algerian Arabic and French comments on an online Algerian newspaper [45], Turkish-Dutch forum posts [183] and web documents in different languages [139].\nAnnotation on a fine-grained level such as individual words has introduced new challenges in the construction of datasets. More fine-grained annotations require more effort and sometimes the segments are so short that they can no longer be clearly attributed to a particular language. For example, annotating the language of named entities remain a challenge in mixed-language texts. Named entities have been labeled according to the context [139], ignored in the evaluation [73, 183] or treated as a separate category [72, 242]. Annotation at sentence-level is also challenging. For example, Zaidan and Callison-Burch [275] annotated a large corpus for Arabic dialect identification using crowdsourcing. Their analysis indicated that many annotators over-identify their native dialect (i.e., they were biased towards labeling texts as written in their own dialect). Elfardy andDiab [72] presented guidelines to annotate texts written in dialectal variants of Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic on a word level."}, {"heading": "5.2 NLP Tools for Multilingual Data", "text": "Most of the current NLP tools, such as parsers, are developed for texts written in a single language. Therefore, such tools are not optimized for processing texts containing multiple languages. In this section, we discuss the development of NLP tools that specifically aim to support the processing of multilingual texts. We start with research on automatic language identification, which is an important step in the preprocessing pipeline of many language-specific analysis tasks. Mixed language documents have introduced new challenges to this task. We then continue with a discussion of work on various other NLP tools (e.g., parsers, topic modeling).\nAutomatic Language Identification. Automatic language identification is often the first step for systems that process mixed-language texts [261]. Furthermore, it supports large-scale analyses of patterns in multilingual communication [137, 138, 196]. Most of the earlier research on automatic language identification focused on documentlevel identification of a single language [13]. To handle mixed-language texts, more fine-grained approaches have been explored, ranging from language identification at the sentence [74, 275, 277] and word level [73, 139, 183, 242, 260], approaches for text segmentation [273], and estimating the proportion of the various languages used within documents [161, 213]. Depending on the application, different approaches may be suitable, but studies that analyze patterns in multilingual communication have mostly focused on word-level identification [183, 242]. Off-the-shelf tools developed for language identification at the document-level (e.g., the TextCat program [37]) are not effective for word-level identification [3, 183]. Languagemodels [73, 183] and dictionaries [3, 73, 183], which are also commonly used in automatic language identification at the document level, have been explored. Furthermore, the context around the words have been exploited using Conditional Random Fields to improve performance on language identification at the word level [139, 183].\nParsing. Early studies on language mixing within computational linguistics focused on developing grammars to model language mixing [95, 133]. However, the models developed in these early studies were not tested on empirical data. The more recently developed systems have been validated on large, real-world data. Solorio and Liu [241] explored various strategies to combine monolingual taggers to parse mixed-language texts. The best performance was obtained by including the output of the monolingual parsers as features in a machine learning algorithm. Vyas et al. [261] studied the impact of different preprocessing steps on POS tagging of English-Hindi mixed language text collected from Facebook. Language identification and transliteration were the major challenges that impacted POS performance.\nLanguage and Topic Models. Language models have been developed to improve speech recognition for mixed language speech, by adding POS and language information to the languagemodels [2] or by incorporating syntactic inversion constraints [157]. Peng et al. [200] developed a topic model that infers language-specific topic distributions based on mixed language text. The main challenge for their model was aligning the inferred topics across languages."}, {"heading": "5.3 Analysis and Prediction of Multilingual Communication", "text": "According to Thomason [252], Gardner-Chloros and Edwards [80], and Bhatt and Bolonyai [23], social factors (e.g., attitudes and motives of the speakers, social and political context) can play an important role in addition to the linguistic factors in multilingual settings. Large-scale analysis of social factors inmultilingual communication has only recently been possible since the availability of automatic language identification tools.\nTwitter is frequently used as a resource for such studies. Focusing on language choice at the user level, researchers have extracted network structures, based on followers and followees [71, 138], or mentions and retweets [103], and analyzed the relation between the composition of such networks and the language choices of users. Users tweeting in multiple languages are often found to function as a bridge between communities tweeting in one language. Besides analyzing language choice at the user level, there is also an interest in the language choices for individual tweets. Jurgens et al. [137] studied tweets written in one language but containing hashtags in another language. Automatic language identification was used to identify the languages of the tweets. However, as they note, some tweets were written in another language because they were automatically generated by applications rather than being a conscious choice of the user. Nguyen et al. [189] studied users in the Netherlands who tweeted in a minority language (Limburgish or Frisian) as well as in Dutch. Most tweets were written in Dutch, but during conversations users often switched to theminority language.Mocanu et al. [176] analyzed the geographic distribution of languages in multilingual regions and cities (such as New York and Montreal) using Twitter.\nIn addition to the analysis of patterns in multilingual communication, several studies have explored the automatic prediction of language switches. The task may seem similar to automatic language identification yet there are differences between the two tasks. Rather than determining the language of an utterance, it involves predicting whether the language of the next utterance is the same without having access to the next utterance itself. Solorio and Liu [240] were the first to predict whether a speaker will switch to another language in English-Spanish bilingual spoken conversations based on lexical and syntactic features. The approach was evaluated using standard ma-\nchine learning metrics as well as human evaluators who rated the naturalness/humanlikeness of the sentences the system generated. Papalexakis et al. [196] predicted when multilingual users switch between languages in a Turkish-Dutch online forum using various features, including features based on multi-word units and emoticons."}, {"heading": "6. Research Agenda", "text": "Computational sociolinguistics is an emerging multidisciplinary field. Closer collaboration between sociolinguists and computational linguists could be beneficial to researchers from both fields. In this paper we have outlined some challenges related to differences in data and methods that must be addressed in order for the exchange to be effective. In this section, we summarize the main challenges for advancing the field of computational sociolinguistics. These fall under three main headings, namely, expanding the scope of inquiry of our field, adapting our methods to increase compatibility, and offering tools."}, {"heading": "6.1 Expanding the Scope of Inquiry", "text": "The field of computational linguistics has begun to investigate issues that overlap with those of the field of sociolinguistics. The emerging availability of data that is of interest to both communities is an important factor, but in order for real synergy to come out of this, additional angles in the research agendas and tuning of the methodological frameworks in the respective communities would be needed.\nGoing beyond lexical and stylistic variation.Many studies within CL focus on lexical variation (e.g., Section 3 on social identity), possibly driven by the focus on prediction performance. Although stylistic variation has received attention, most of these studies (e.g., on linguistic style accommodation) employ selected categories from LIWC to capture broad grammatical categories [202], such as determiners, prepositions and pronouns. Advances in the area of stylometry [243] could inspire the exploration of new features to capture style. Besides lexical and stylistic variation, linguistic variation also occurs on many other layers (e.g., phonology, syntax, morphology). These different layers of variation have been well studied within sociolinguistics, but within computational sociolinguistics they have received limited attention so far (e.g., phonological [66, 132] and syntactic [60, 84] variation).\nExtending focus to other social variables. A large body of work exists on the modeling of gender, age and regional variation (Cf. Section 3). Other variables (e.g., social class [148]) have barely received any attention so far within computational sociolinguistics. Although it is more difficult to obtain labels for some social variables, they are essential for a richer understanding of language variation and more robust analyses.\nGoing beyond English and monolingual data. The world is multilingual and multicultural, but English has received much more attention within computational sociolinguistics than other languages. There is a need for research to validate the generalizability of findings based on English data for other languages [53]. Furthermore, most studies within computational linguistics generally assume that texts are written in one language. However, these assumptions may not hold true especially in social media. A single user may use multiple languages, sometimes even within a syntactic unit, while most NLP tools are not optimized to process such texts. Tools that are able to process\nmixed-language texts will improve analyses of such data and shed more light on the social and linguistic factors involved in multilingual communication."}, {"heading": "6.2 AdaptingMethodological Frameworks to Increase Compatibility", "text": "To make use of the rich repertoire of theory and practice from sociolinguistics and to contribute to it, we have to appreciate the methodologies that underlie sociolinguistic research, e.g., the rules of engagement for joining into the ongoing scientific discourse. However, as we have begun to do so, immediately a culture clash can be observed. While the CL community has experienced a history in which theory and empiricism are treated as the extreme ends of a spectrum, in the social sciences there is no such dichotomy, and empiricism contributes substantially to theory. Moving forward, research within computational sociolinguistics should build on and seek to partner in extending existing sociolinguistic theories and insights. However, what this requires is placing a stronger focus on interpretability of the developed models.\nControlling for multiple variables. Sociolinguistic studies typically control for multiple social variables (e.g., gender, age, social class, ethnicity). However, many studies in computational sociolinguistics focus on individual variables (e.g., only gender, or only age), which can be explained by the focus on social media data. The uncontrolled nature of social media makes it challenging to obtain data about the social backgrounds of the speakers and to understand the various biases that such datasets might have. The result is that models are frequently confounded, which results in low interpretability as well as limited justification for generalization to other domains.\nOn the other hand, much work in the CL community has focused on structured modeling approaches that take a step towards addressing these issues [134, 135]. These modeling approaches are very similar to hierarchical modeling approaches used in sociolinguistic research to control for multiple sources of variation and thus avoid misattributing weight to extraneous variables. A stronger partnership within the field of CL between researchers interested in computational sociolinguistics and researchers interested in multi-domain learning would be valuable for addressing some of these limitations. In this regard, inferring demographic variables automatically (see Section 3) may also help, since these predicted demographic variables could then be used in structuring the models. Another approach is the use of census data when location data is already available. For example, Eisenstein et al. [70] studied lexical change in social media by using census data to obtain demographic information of the geographical locations. They justified their approach by assuming that lexical change is influenced by the demographics of the population in these locations, and not necessarily by the demographics of the particular Twitter users in these locations. However, such an assumption may not hold for other research questions.\nDevelopingmodels that generalize across domains.On a related note, recently several studies within the area of computational sociolinguistics have performed experiments across domains [227, 228] and explored the effectiveness of domain adaptation approaches [84, 185, 204]. Such approaches could enable distinguishing the variables that work differently in different contexts, but this would require identifying the relevant domains in the studied data. Other directions involve reconsidering the features used in an attempt to include more features with a deep connection with the predicted variable of interest. For example, Gianfortoni et al. [84] show that features such as n-grams, usually reported to be predictive for gender classification, did not perform well after control-\nling for occupation in a blog corpus, but pattern-based features inspired by findings related to gender based language practices did. However, Herring et al. [111] found no significant relation between gender and previously identified gender features in their blog corpus after controlling for genre. Furthermore, considering the implications of linguistic agency, when the focus is on interpretability of the models, we must consider that the resulting average prediction performance of interpretable models may be lower [204].\nUsing sociolinguistics and the social sciences as a source of inspiration for methodological reflection.Going forward, we need to appreciatewhere our work stands along an important continuum that represents a fundamental tension in the social sciences: qualitative approaches that seek to preserve the complexity of the phenomena of interest, versus quantitative approaches that discretize (but thereby also simplify) the phenomena to achieve more generalizability. For computational linguistics, a primarily quantitative field, work from research areas with a less strong or less exclusive focus on quantitative measures, such as sociolinguistics and the social sciences, could serve as a source of inspiration for methodological reflection. In this survey, we have questioned the operationalization of the concept of gender (Section 3.2), age (Section 3.3) and language (Section 3.4) as discrete, static, categories, based on insights from sociolinguistics. Further critical reflection on such operationalizations could lead to deeper insight into the limitations of the developed models and the incorrect predictions that they sometimes make. Furthermore, it could also be helpful in communicating the methods and findings to other research communities."}, {"heading": "6.3 Tuning NLP Tools to Requirements of Sociolinguistics Research", "text": "As a final important direction, we should consider what would be required for NLP tools to be supportive for sociolinguistic work.\nDeveloping models that can guide users of data analysis systems in taking next steps. Sociolinguists are primarily interested in new insights about language use. In contrast, much of the work within CL is centered around highly specific analysis tasks that are isolated from scenarios of use, and the focus on the obtained performance figures for such tasks is fairly dominant. Only for few analysis methods, validation of the outcomes has been pursued (Have we measured the right thing?) in view of the potential for integration of the models outside lab-like environments. Furthermore many of the models developed within CL make use of thousands of features. As a result, it is often hard to deploy the predictions in a real-life setting and their value for practical data exploration tasks is therefore often limited. Sparse models (e.g., [69]) that identify small sets of predictive features would be more suited for exploratory analysis.\nDeveloping pre-processing tools to support the analysis of language variation. The performance of many developed NLP tools is lower on informal text. For example, POS taggers perform less on texts written by certain user groups (e.g., younger people [122]) or on texts in certain language varieties (e.g., AAVE [132]). One of the approaches to improve the performance of tools has been to normalize the texts, but as Eisenstein [65] argues doing so is removing the variation that is central to the study of sociolinguistics. To support deeper sociolinguistic analyses and to go beyond shallow features, we thus need pre-processing tools, such as POS taggers, that are able to handle the variation found in informal texts and that are not biased towards certain social groups."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion", "text": "While the computational linguistics field has historically emphasized interpretation and manipulation of the propositional content of language, another valid perspective on language is that it is a dynamic, social entity. While some aspects of language viewed from a social perspective are predictable, and thus behave much like other aspects more commonly the target of inquiry in the field, we must acknowledge that linguistic agency is a big part of how language is used to construct social identities, to build and maintain social relationships, and even to define the bounds of communities. With the increasing research on social media data and in parallel with the emergence of computational social science, we have observed a surge of interest within the computational linguistics community on sociolinguistic topics. In this article, we have defined and set out a research agenda for the emerging field of \u2018Computational Sociolinguistics\u2019. We have aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of studies published within the field of CL that touch upon sociolinguistic themes in order to provide an overview of what has been accomplished so far and where there is room for growth. In particular, we have endeavored to illustrate how the large-scale data drivenmethods of our community can complement existing sociolinguistic studies, but also how sociolinguistics can inform and challenge our methods and assumptions."}], "references": [{"title": "Combination of recurrent neural networks and factored language models for code-switching language modeling", "author": ["Heike Adel", "Thang Ngoc Vu", "Tanja Schultz"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers),", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2013}, {"title": "An unsupervised system for identifying English inclusions in German text", "author": ["Beatrice Alex"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the ACL Student Research Workshop,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Online data collection", "author": ["Jannis Androutsopoulos"], "venue": "Data Collection in Sociolinguistics: Methods and Applications.

Recently, a surge of interest can be observed within the computational linguistics (CL) community in the social dimension of language. In this article we present a survey of the emerging field of \u2018Computational Sociolinguistics\u2019 that reflects this increased interest. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of CL research on sociolinguistic themes, featuring topics such as the relation between language and social identity, language use in social interaction and multilingual communication. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential for synergy between the research communities involved, by showing how the large-scale data-driven methods that are widely used in CL can complement existing sociolinguistic studies, and how sociolinguistics can inform and challenge the methods and assumptions employed in CL studies. We hope to convey the possible benefits of a closer collaboration between the two communities and conclude with a discussion of open challenges.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
