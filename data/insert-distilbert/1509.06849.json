Such models use a graph structure to encode the joint probability distribution, where vertices correspond to random variables and edges specify conditional dependencies. An important inference task in many applications involving GMs is to find the most-likely assignment to the variables in a GM, i.e., Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP). Belief Propagation (BP) is a popular algorithm for approximately solving the MAP inference problem and it is an iterative, message passing one that is exact on tree structured GMs. BP often shows remarkably strong heuristic performance beyond trees, i.e., over loopy GMs. Furthermore, BP is of a particular relevance to large-scale problems due to its potential for parallelization [5] and its ease of programming within the modern programming models for parallel computing, e.g., GraphLab [6], GraphChi [7] and OpenMP [8]. \u2217M.

The important common feature of these models is that BP converges to a correct assignment when the Linear Programming (LP) relaxation of the combinatorial optimization is tight, i.e., when it shows no integrality gap. The LP tightness is an inevitable condition to guarantee the performance of BP and no combinatorial optimization instance has been known where BP would be used to solve problems without the LP tightness. On the other hand, in the LP literature, it has been extensively studied how to enforce the LP tightness via solving multiple intermediate LPs that are systematically designed, e.g., via the cutting-plane method [22]. Motivated by these studies, we pose a similar question for BP, \u201chow to enforce correctness of BP, possibly by solving multiple intermediate BPs\u201d. In this paper, we show how to resolve this question for the minimum weight (or cost) perfect matching problem over arbitrary graphs.\nContribution. We develop an algorithm, coined Blossom-BP, for solving the minimum weight matching problem over an arbitrary graph. Our algorithm solves multiple intermediate BPs until the final BP outputs the solution. The algorithm is sequential, where each step includes running BP over a \u2018contracted\u2019 graph derived from the original graph by contractions and infrequent expansions of blossoms, i.e., odd sets of vertices. To build such a scheme, we first design an algorithm, coined Blossom-LP, solving multiple intermediate LPs. Second, we show that each LP is solvable by BP using the recent framework [16] that establishes a generic connection between BP and LP. For the first part, cutting-plane methods solving multiple intermediate LPs for the minimum weight matching problem have been discussed by several authors over the past decades [17, 18, 19, 20, 21] and a provably polynomial-time scheme was recently suggested [22]. However, LPs in [22] were quite complex to solve by BP. To address the issue, we design much simpler intermediate LPs that allow utilizing the framework of [16].\nWe prove that Blossom-BP and Blossom-LP guarantee to terminate inO(n2) of BP and LP runs, respectively, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. To establish the polynomial complexity, we show that intermediate outputs of Blossom-BP and Blossom-LP are equivalent to those of a variation of the Blossom-V algorithm [23] which is the latest implementation of the Blossom algorithm due to Kolmogorov. The main difference is that Blossom-V updates parameters by maintaining disjoint tree graphs, while Blossom-BP and Blossom-LP implicitly achieve this by maintaining disjoint cycles, claws and tree graphs. Notice, however, that these combinatorial structures are auxiliary, as required for proofs, and they do not appear explicitly in the algorithm descriptions. Therefore, they are much easier to implement than Blossom-V that maintains complex data structures, e.g., priority queues. To the best of our knowledge, Blossom-BP and Blossom-LP are the simplest possible algorithms available for solving the problem in polynomial time. Our proof implies that in essence, Blossom-BP offers a distributed version of the Edmonds\u2019 Blossom algorithm [24] jumping at once over many sub-steps of Blossom-V with a single BP.\nThe subject of solving convex optimizations (other than LP) via BP was discussed in the literature [25, 26, 27]. However, we are not aware of any similar attempts to solve Integer Programming, via sequential application of BP. We believe that the approach developed in this paper is of a broader interest, as it promises to advance the challenge of designing BP-based MAP solvers for a broader class of GMs. Furthermore, Blossom-LP stands alone as providing an interpretation for the Edmonds\u2019 algorithm in terms of a sequence of tractable LPs. The Edmonds\u2019 original LP formulation contains exponentially many constraints, thus naturally\nsuggesting to seek for a sequence of LPs, each with a subset of constraints, gradually reducing the integrality gap to zero in a polynomial number of steps. However, it remained illusive for decades: even when the bipartite LP relaxation of the problem has an integral optimal solution, the standard Edmonds\u2019 algorithm keeps contracting and expanding a sequence of blossoms. As we mentioned earlier, we resolve the challenge by showing that Blossom-LP is (implicitly) equivalent to a variant of the Edmonds\u2019 algorithm with three major modifications: (a) parameter-update via maintaining cycles, claws and trees, (b) addition of small random corrections to weights, and (c) initialization using the bipartite LP relaxation.\nOrganization. In Section 2, we provide backgrounds on the minimum weight perfect matching problem and the BP algorithm.

Given integer edge weights (or costs) w = [we] \u2208 Z|E|, the minimum weight (or cost) perfect matching problem consists in computing a perfect matching which minimizes the summation of its associated edge weights. The problem is formulated as the following IP (Integer Programming):\nminimize w \u00b7 x subject to \u2211 e\u2208\u03b4(v) xe = 1, \u2200v \u2208 V, x = [xe] \u2208 {0, 1}|E|\n(1)\nWithout loss of generality, one can assume that weights are strictly positive.1 Furthermore, we assume that IP (1) is feasible, i.e., there exists at least one perfect matching in G. One can naturally relax the above integer constraints to x = [xe] \u2208 [0, 1]|E| to obtain an LP (Linear Programming), which is called the bipartite relaxation. The integrality of the bipartite LP relaxation is not guaranteed, however it can be enforced by adding the so-called blossom inequalities [23]:\nminimize w \u00b7 x subject to \u2211 e\u2208\u03b4(v) xe = 1, \u2200v \u2208 V, \u2211 e\u2208\u03b4(S) xe \u2265 1, \u2200S \u2208 L, x = [xe] \u2208 [0, 1]|E|,\n(2)\nwhere L \u2282 2V is a collection of odd cycles in G, called blossoms, and \u03b4(S) is a set of edges between S and V \\ S. It is known that if L is the collection of all the odd cycles in G, then LP (2) always has an integral solution. However, notice that the number of odd cycles is exponential in |V |, thus solving LP (2) is computationally intractable. To overcome this complication we are looking for a tractable subset of L of a polynomial size which guarantees the integrality. Our algorithm, searching for such a tractable subset of L is iterative: at each iteration it adds or subtracts a blossom.\n1If some edges have negative weights, one can add the same positive constant to all edge weights, and this does not alter the solution of IP (1)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Background on max-product Belief Propagation", "text": "The max-product Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm is a popular heuristic for approximating the MAP assignment in a GM.

Hence, one can naturally define y\u2217 = [y\u2020v y \u2021 u] to cover all yvariables, i.e., yv, yS for all v \u2208 V, S \u2208 L. If we define x\u2217 for the output matching M\u2217 of Blossom-LP as x\u2217e = 1 if e \u2208M\u2217 and x\u2217e = 0 otherwise, then x\u2217 and y\u2217 satisfy the following complementary slackness condition:\nx\u2217e ( we \u2212 y\u2217u \u2212 y\u2217v \u2212 \u2211 S\u2208L y\u2217S ) = 0, \u2200e = (u, v) \u2208 E, y\u2217S  \u2211 e\u2208\u03b4(S) x\u2217e \u2212 1  = 0, \u2200S \u2208 L, where L is the last set of blossoms at the termination of Blossom-BP. In the above, the first equality is from (11) and the definition of w\u2020, and the second equality is because the construction of M\u2217 in Blossom-BP is designed to enforce \u2211 e\u2208\u03b4(S) x \u2217 e = 1. This proves that x\n\u2217 is the optimal solution of LP (2) and M\u2217 is the minimum weight perfect matching, thus completing the proof of Lemma 6.\nTo guarantee the termination of Blossom-LP in polynomial time, we use the following notions.\nDefinition 1 Claw is a subset of edges such that every edge in it shares a common vertex, called center, with all other edges, i.e., the claw forms a star graph.\nDefinition 2 Given a graph G = (V,E), a set of odd cycles O \u2282 2E , a set of clawsW \u2282 2E and a matching M \u2282 E, (O,W,M) is called cycle-claw-matching decomposition of G if all sets in O\u222aW \u222a{M} are disjoint and each vertex v \u2208 V is covered by exactly one set among them.\nTo analyze the running time of Blossom-BP, we construct an iterative auxiliary algorithm that outputs the minimum weight perfect matching in a bounded number of iterations. The auxiliary algorithm outputs a cycle-claw-matching decomposition at each iteration, and it terminates when the cycle-claw-matching decomposition corresponds to a perfect matching. We will prove later that the auxiliary algorithm and Blossom-LP are equivalent and, therefore, conclude that the iteration of Blossom-LP is also bounded.\nTo design the auxiliary algorithm, we consider the following dual of LP (8):\nminimize \u2211 v\u2208V \u2020 yv\nsubject to w\u2020e \u2212 yv \u2212 yu \u2265 0, \u2200e = (u, v) \u2208 E\u2020, yv(S) \u2265 0, \u2200S \u2208 L. (12)\nNext we introduce an auxiliary iterative algorithm which updates iteratively the blossom set L and also the set of variables yv, yS for v \u2208 V, S \u2208 L. We call edge e = (u, v) \u2018tight\u2019 if\nwe \u2212 yu \u2212 yv \u2212 \u2211\nS\u2208L:e\u2208\u03b4(S)\nyS = 0.\nNow, we are ready to describe the auxiliary algorithm having the following parameters.\n\u25e6 G\u2020 = (V \u2020, E\u2020), L \u2282 2V , and yv, yS for v \u2208 V, S \u2208 L.\n\u25e6 (O,W,M): A cycle-claw-matching decomposition of G\u2020\n\u25e6 T \u2282 G\u2020: A tree graph consisting of + and \u2212 vertices.\nInitially, set G\u2020 = G and L, T = \u2205. In addition, set yv, yS by an optimal solution of LP (12) with w\u2020 = w and (O,W,M) by the cycle-claw-matching decomposition of G\u2020 consisting of tight edges with respect to [yv, yS ]. The parameters are updated iteratively as follows.\nThe auxiliary algorithm\nIterate the following steps until M becomes a perfect matching:\n1. Choose a vertex r \u2208 V \u2020 from the following rule.\nExpansion. If W 6= \u2205, choose a claw W \u2208 W of center blossom vertex c and choose a non-center vertex r in W . Remove the blossom S(c) corresponding to c from L and update G\u2020 by expanding it. Find a matching M \u2032 covering all vertices in W and S(c) except for r and update M \u2190M \u222aM \u2032.\nContraction. Otherwise, choose a cycle C \u2208 O, add and remove it from L and O, respectively. In addition, G\u2020 is also updated by contracting C and choose the contracted vertex r in G\u2020 and set yr = 0.\nSet tree graph T having r as + vertex and no edge.\n2. Continuously increase yv of every + vertex v in T and decrease yv of \u2212 vertex v in T by the same amount until one of the following events occur:\nGrow. If a tight edge (u, v) exists where u is a + vertex of T and v is covered by M , find a tight edge (v, w) \u2208M . Add edges (u, v), (v, w) to T and remove (v, w) from M where v, w becomes \u2212,+ vertices of T , respectively.\nMatching. If a tight edge (u, v) exists where u is a + vertex of T and v is covered by C \u2208 O, find a matching M \u2032 that covers T \u222a C. Update M \u2190 M \u222aM \u2032 and remove C from O.\nCycle. If a tight edge (u, v) exists where u, v are + vertices of T , find a cycle C and a matching M \u2032 that covers T . Update M \u2190M \u222aM \u2032 and add C to O.\nClaw. If a blossom vertex v(S) with yv(S) = 0 exists, find a claw W (of center v(S)) and a matching M \u2032 covering T . Update M \u2190M \u222aM \u2032 and add W toW .\nIf Grow occurs, resume the step 2. Otherwise, go to the step 1.\nNote that the auxiliary algorithm updates parameters in such a way that the number of vertices in every claw in the cycle-claw-matching decomposition is 3 since every \u2212 vertex has degree 2. Hence, there exists a unique matchingM \u2032 in the expansion step. Furthermore, the existence of a cycle-claw-matching decomposition at the initialization can be guaranteed using the complementary slackness condition and the half-integrality of LP (8). We establish the following lemma for the running time of the auxiliary algorithm.\nLemma 7 The auxiliary algorithm terminates in O(|V |2) iterations.\nProof. To this end, let (O,W,M) be the cycle-claw-matching decomposition ofG\u2020 andN = |O|+ |W| at some iteration of the algorithm. We first prove that |O|+ |W| does not increase at every iteration. At Step 1, the algorithm deletes an element in either O or W and hence, |O|+ |W| = N \u2212 1. On the other hand, at Step 2, one can observe that the algorithm run into one of the following scenarios with respect to |O|+ |W|:\nGrow. |O|+ |W| = N \u2212 1\nMatching. |O|+ |W| = N \u2212 2\nCycle. |O|+ |W| = N\nClaw. |O|+ |W| = N\nTherefore, the total number of odd cycles and claws at Step 2 does not increase as well. From now on, we define {t1, t2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 : ti \u2208 Z} to be indexes of iterations when Matching occurs at Step 2, and we call the set of iterations {t : ti \u2264 t < ti+1} as the i-th stage. We will show that the length of each stage is O(|V |), i.e., for all i,\n|ti \u2212 ti+1| = O(|V |). (13)\nThis implies that the auxiliary algorithm terminates in O(|V |2) iterations since the total number of odd cycles and claws at the initialization is O(|V |) and it decrease by two if Matching occurs. To this end, we prove the following key lemmas, which are proven in the appendix.\nClaim 8 At every iteration of the auxiliary algorithm, there exist no path consisting of tight edges between two vertices v1, v2 \u2208 V \u2020 where each vi is either a blossom vertex v(S) with yS = 0 or a (blossom or non-blossom) vertex in an odd cycle consisted of tight edges.\nClaim 9 Consider a + vertex v \u2208 V \u2020 at some iteration of the auxiliary algorithm. Then, at the first iteration afterward where v becomes a \u2212 vertex or is removed from V \u2020 (i.e., due to the contraction of a blossom), it is connected to an odd cycle C \u2208 O via an even-sized alternating path consisting of tight edges with respect to matching M whenever each iteration starts during the same stage. Here, O and M are from the cycle-claw-decomposition.\nNow we aim for proving (13). To this end, we claim the following.\n\u2660 A + vertex of V \u2020 at some iteration cannot be a \u2212 one (whenever it appears in V \u2020) afterward in the same stage.\nFor proving \u2660, we assume that a + vertex v \u2208 V \u2020 at the t-th iteration violates \u2660 to derive a contradiction, i.e., it becomes a \u2212 one in some tree T during t\u2032-th iteration in the same stage. Without loss of generality, one can assume that the vertex v has the minimum value of t\u2032 \u2212 t among such vertices violating \u2660. We consider two cases: (a) v is always contained in V \u2020 afterward in the same stage, and (b) v is removed from V \u2020 (at least once, due to the contraction of a blossom containing v) afterward in the same stage. First consider the case (a). Then, due to the assumption of the case (a) and Claim 9, there exist a path P from v to a cycle C \u2208 O when the t\u2032-th iteration starts. Then, one can observe that in order to add v to tree T as a \u2212 vertex, it must be the first vertex in path P added to T by Grow during the t-iteration. Furthermore, tree T keeps continuing to perform Grow afterward using tight edges of path P without modifying parameter y until Matching occurs, i.e., the new stage\nstarts. This is because Claw and Cycle are impossible to occur before Matching due to Claim 8. Hence, it contradicts to the assumption that t and t\u2032 are in the same stage, and completes the proof of \u2660 for the case (a). Now we consider the case (b), i.e., v is removed from V \u2020 due to the contraction of a blossom S \u2208 L. In this case, the blossom vertex v(S) \u2208 V \u2020 must be expanded before v becomes a \u2212 vertex. However, v(S) becomes a + vertex after contracting S and a \u2212 vertex before expanding v(S), i.e., v(S) also violates \u2660. This contradicts to the assumption that the vertex v has the minimum value of t\u2032 \u2212 t among vertices violating \u2660, and completes the proof of \u2660. Due to \u2660, a blossom cannot expand after contraction in the same stage, where we remind that a blossom vertex becomes a + one after contraction and a \u2212 one before expansion. This implies that the number contractions and expansions in the same stage is O(|V |), which leads to (13) and completes the proof of Lemma 7.\nNow we are ready to prove the equivalence between the auxiliary algorithm and the BlossomLP, i.e., prove that the numbers of iterations of Blossom-LP and the auxiliary algorithm are equal. To this end, given a cycle-claw-matching decomposition (O,W,M), observe that one can choose the corresponding x = [xe] \u2208 {0, 1/2, 1}|E \u2020| that satisfies constraints of LP (8):\nxe =  1 if e is an edge inW or M 1 2 if e is an edge in O 0 otherwise .\nSimilarly, given a half-integral x = [xe] \u2208 {0, 1/2, 1}|E \u2020| that satisfies constraints of LP (8), one can find the corresponding cycle-claw-matching decomposition. Furthermore, one can also define weight w\u2020 in G\u2020 for the auxiliary algorithm as Blossom-LP does:\nw\u2020e = we \u2212 \u2211\nv\u2208V :v 6\u2208V \u2020,e\u2208\u03b4(v)\nyv \u2212 \u2211\nS\u2208L:v(S)6\u2208V \u2020,e\u2208\u03b4(S)\nyS , \u2200 e \u2208 E\u2020. (14)\nIn the auxiliary algorithm, e = (u, v) \u2208 E\u2020 is tight if and only if\nw\u2020e \u2212 y\u2020u \u2212 y\u2020v = 0.\nUnder these equivalences in parameters between Blossom-LP and the auxiliary algorithm, we will use the induction to show that cycle-claw-matching decompositions maintained by both algorithms are equal at every iteration, as stated in the following lemma.\nLemma 10 Define the following notation:\ny\u2020 = [yv : v \u2208 V \u2020] and y\u2021 = [yv, yS : v \u2208 V, v 6\u2208 V \u2020, S \u2208 L, v(S) /\u2208 V \u2020],\ni.e., y\u2020 and y\u2021 are parts of y which involves and does not involve in V \u2020, respectively. Then, the Blossom-LP and the auxiliary algorithm update parameters L, y\u2021 equivalently and output the same cycle-claw-decomposition of G\u2020 at each iteration.\nProof. Initially, it is trivial. Now we assume the induction hypothesis that L, y\u2021 and the cycleclaw-decomposition are equivalent between both algorithms at the previous iteration. First, it is easy to observe that L is updated equivalently since it is only decided by the cycle-clawdecomposition at the previous iteration in both algorithms. Next, it is also easy to check that y\u2021 is updated equivalently since (a) if we remove a blossom S from L, it is trivial and (b) if\nwe add a blossom S = V (C) for some cycle C to L, y\u2021 is uniquely decided by C and w\u2020 in both algorithms.\nIn the remaining of this section, we will show that once L, y\u2021 are updated equivalently, the cycle-claw-decomposition also changes equivalently in both algorithms. Observe that G\u2020, w\u2020 only depends on L, y\u2021. In addition, y\u2020 maintained by the auxiliary algorithm also satisfies constraints of LP (12). Consider the cycle-claw-matching decomposition (O,W,M) of the auxiliary algorithm, and the corresponding x = [xe] \u2208 {0, 1/2, 1}|E\n\u2020| that satisfies constraints of LP (8). Then, x and y\u2020 satisfy the complementary slackness condition:\nxe(w \u2020 e \u2212 y\u2020u \u2212 y\u2020v) = 0, \u2200e = (u, v) \u2208 E\u2020\ny\u2020v(S)  \u2211 e\u2208\u03b4(v(S)) xe \u2212 1  = 0, \u2200S \u2208 L, where the first equality is because the cycle-claw-matching decomposition consists of tight edges and the second equality is because every claw maintained by the auxiliary algorithm has its center vertex v(S) with yv(S) = 0 for some S \u2208 L. Therefore, x is an optimal solution of LP (8), i.e., the cycle-claw-decomposition is updated equivalently in both algorithms. This completes the proof of Lemma 10.\nThe above lemma implies that Blossom-LP also terminates inO(|V |2) iterations due to Lemma 7. This completes the proof of Theorem 2. The equivalence between the half-integral solution of LP (8) in Blossom-LP and the cycle-claw-matching decomposition in the auxiliary algorithm implies that LP (8) is always has a half-integral solution, and hence, one of Steps B.(a), B.(b) or B.(c) always occurs."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "The BP algorithm has been popular for approximating inference solutions arising in graphical models, where its distributed implementation, associated ease of programming and strong parallelization potential are the main reasons for its growing popularity.

This means that one can proceed the proof of Lemma 4 for the submatrix of A deleting the first row and column. Therefore, one can assume that each row of A contains exactly two non-zero entries.\nWe construct a graph G = (V,E) such that\nV = [m] := {1, 2, . . . ,m} and E = {(j, k) : aij = aik = 1 for some i \u2208 V },\ni.e., each row Ai[m] = (Ai1, . . . , Aim) and each column A[m]i = (A1i, . . . , Ami)T correspond to an edge and a vertex of G, respectively.

The iteration terminates with Matching. This contradicts to the assumption that t\u2020, t\u2021-th iterations are in the same stage, i.e., no Matching occurs during the t-th iteration.\nII. The iteration terminates with Cycle. The vertex v is connected to the cycle newly added to O via an even-sized alternating path consisting of tight edges in tree T at the start of the next (i.e., (t+ 1)-th) iteration.\nIII. The iteration terminates with Claw. The vertex v becomes a + vertex of tree T of the next (i.e., (t + 1)-th) iteration. This is due to the following reasons. After Claw, the algorithm expands the center vertex of newly made claw W by Expansion in the next iteration. Then, there exists an even-sized alternating path PW from r to v consisted of tight edges in the newly constructed tree T . Furthermore, edges in PW are continuously added to T by Grow without modifying parameter y in Step 2 until v becomes a + vertex in T . This is because Claw and Cycle are impossible to occur due to Claim 8.\nForF \u2212 2, in order to derive a contradiction, assume that a vertex v violatesF \u2212 2 at some iteration, i.e. the algorithm parameters associated to the even-sized alternating path P and the cycle C in the statement ofF\u2212 2 are updated during the iteration. Observe that the algorithm parameters are updated due to one of the following scenarios:\nI. The cycle C is contracted. If v is in C, v no longer remains in V \u2020 and contradicts to the assumption that v remains in V \u2020. If v is not in C, v becomes a + vertex in tree T after continuously adding edges of P by Grow without modifying parameter y due to Claim 8. This contradicts to the assumption of F \u2212 2 that v is not in tree T during the t-th iteration.\nII. A vertex in C is added to tree T . Then, Matching occurs, i.e. the new stage starts. This contradicts to the assumption that t\u2020, t\u2021-th iterations are in the same stage.\nIII. An edge in P is added to tree T . Then, there exists a vertex u in P that first became a \u2212 vertex among vertices in P , and it either (a) has an even-sized alternating path P \u2032 to C consisting of tight edges or (b) has an odd-sized alternating path P \u2032 to v consisting of tight edges. For (a), the edges in P \u2032 are continuously added to T without modifying parameter y by Claim 8 and Matching occurs. This contradicts to the assumption again. For (b), P \u2032 are added to T without modifying parameter y due to Claim 8, and v is added to tree T as a + vertex. This contradicts to the assumption ofF\u2212 2 that v is not in tree T during the t-th iteration.\nTherefore, F holds. One can observe that there exists t\u2217 \u2208 (t\u2020, t\u2021) such that at the t\u2217-th iteration, v last becomes a + vertex before the t\u2021-th iteration, i.e. v is not in tree T during t-th iteration for t\u2217 < t < t\u2021. Then v is connected to some cycle C in O via an even length alternating path P at (t\u2217 + 1)-th iteration and such path and cycle remains unchanged during t-th iteration for t\u2217 < t \u2264 t\u2021 due toF.
