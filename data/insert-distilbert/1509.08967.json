INTRODUCTION", "text": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [1] have recently pushed the state of the art on large-scale tasks in many domains dealing with natural data, most notably in computer vision tasks like image classification [2, 3], object detection [4, 5], object localization [6] and segmentation [7].\nEarly applications of neural nets to speech recognition used Time-Delay Neural Nets [8] which can be seen as simple forms of CNNs without pooling or subsampling. Full-fledged CNNs with pooling and subsampling were soon applied to speech recognition and combined with dynamic time warping [9, 10]. While the globally-trained combination of neural nets and HMMs for speech and handwriting goes back to the 1990s [11, 1], only due to recent developments [12, 13, 14] HMM/DNN hybrid modeling became dominant in ASR. In the context of these hybrid models, the use of CNNs is relatively recent [15]. CNNs were shown to achieve state of the art performance on the benchmark datasets Broadcast News and Switchboard 300 [16]. However, in contrast to the trend in other domains where deeper architectures are often shown to gain performance, the classical CNN architecture in LVCSR [16, 17, 18] has only two convolutional layers.\nOur network architecture (Section 2.1) is strongly inspired by the work of Simonyan et al. [3] (subsequently referred to as \u201cVGG Net\u201d) which obtained second place in the classification section of the Imagenet 2014 competition. The central idea of VGG Net is to replace large convolutional kernels by a stack of 3\u00d73 kernels with ReLU nonlinearities without pooling between these layers; The authors argue the advantage of this is twofold: (1) additional nonlinearity hence more expressive power, and (2) a reduced number of parameters. Using these principles, very deep networks are trained with up to 19 weight layers (of which 16 are convolutional and 3 fully connected). By contrast, the classical CNNs deployed in LVCSR have typically only two convolutional layers, use large (9\u00d79) kernels in the first layer, and use sigmoid activation functions. The first goal of this work is to adapt the VGG Net architecture to LVCSR. Most closely related to this is [19], which also uses VGG Net-inspired CNNs for LVCSR 1. In contrast to our work, the architectures investigated in [19] are quite different and the paper only provides results from training on a non-standard Switchboard51h dataset, with WER not close to state of the art performance on Hub5\u201900.\nIn the context of low-resource language tasks, it can be crucial to leverage training data in languages other than the target language. Therefore we trained multilingual deep CNNs, which we describe in Section 2.2. This is related to multilingual neural networks in hybrid NN-HMM systems [20] which have been extended to multilingual bottleneck architectures for tandem models [21, 22] and have proven valuable for spoken term detection [23]. To our knowledge, no work has been published that extends the multilingual setup to CNNs.\nThe multi-scale features described in Section 2.1 aim at exploiting more context at very low computational cost. They are inspired by the recent success of combining information at multiple scales in tasks like traffic sign recognition [24], semantic segmentation [7, 25] and depth map prediction [26]. In LVCSR the multi-scale idea has been explored in tandem systems [27] and the CLDNN architecture [28].\nAs training becomes more challenging with increasing depth, we used two recently proposed optimization algorithms, Adadelta [29] and Adam [30] (Section 2.4). Both algorithms are first order gradient-based optimization methods, which keep track of an estimate of the first and second order moment of the gradient to tune the step size of each weight separately.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the novel aspects of our work: very deep CNN architectures in 2.1, multilingual CNN training in 2.2, multi-scale features in 2.1, and training details in 2.4. We then show experimental results on Babel in 3.1 and on Switchboard in 3.2.\n1This work was pursued independently of ours, and was published about one week before submission of this paper.\nar X\niv :1\n50 9.\n08 96\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n9 Se\np 20\n15"}, {"heading": "2. ARCHITECTURAL AND TRAINING NOVELTIES", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1. Very Deep Convolutional Networks", "text": "The very deep convolutional networks we describe here are adaptations of the VGG Net architecture [3] to the LVCSR domain, where until now networks with two convolutional layers dominated [16, 17, 18]. Table 1 shows the configurations of the deep CNNs. The deepest configuration, WDX, has 14 weight layers: 10 convolutional and 4 fully connected. As in [3], we omit the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) layers following every convolutional and fully connected layer. The convolutional layers are written as conv({input feature maps}\u2013{output feature maps}) where each kernel is understood to be size 3\u00d73. The pooling layers are written as (time x frequency) with stride equal to the pool size.\nFor architectures VDX and WDX, we apply zero padding of size 1 at every side before every convolution, while for architecture VC(X) and VB(X) we use the convolutions to reduce the size of the feature maps, hence only in the higher layers of VC(X) padding is applied.\nIn contrast to [3], we do not reinitialize the deeper models with the shallower models. Each model is trained from scratch with random initialization from a uniform distribution in the range [\u2212a, a] where a = (kW \u00d7 kH \u00d7 numInputFeatureMaps)\u2212 1 2 . This follows the argument of [31] to initialize the weights such that the variance of the activations on each layer does not explode or vanish during the forward pass."}, {"heading": "2.2. Multilingual Convolutional Networks", "text": "Figure 1 shows a multilingual VBX network, which we used for most of our Babel experiments. It is similar to previous multilingual deep neural networks [20], with the main difference that the shared lower layers of the network are convolutional.\nA second difference is that we untie more than only the last layer,\nmeaning that the weights and biases of multiple fully connected layers are different for each language. Since the output dimension of the convolutional stages is typically large when using large context windows, most of the weights are in the first fully connected layer, which acts on the flattened output of the convolutional stages. This is an argument to share this large, first fully connected layer across languages. We experimentally confirmed that for all architectures, untying all fully connected layers except the lowest one gives optimal performance, with strong degradation if the first fully connected layer is also untied. This untying corresponds to a view of the shared layers and the first fully connected layer as a shared multilingual feature extractor, while the fully connected layers higher up form the classifier.\nThe multilingual CNN is trained in a round-robin fashion: we process a mini-batch for each language before making an update to the weights. In the shared part of the network the gradients of all mini-batches are accumulated between weight updates."}, {"heading": "2.3. Multi-scale feature maps", "text": "The main goal of constructing multi-scale feature maps is to add more context without increasing the computational cost. Figure 2 illustrates the concept of multi-scale feature maps, where additional input feature maps contain a larger view of the context of the frame by downsampling larger context windows with different strides. Kernels on the first convolutional layer are able to combine information from multiple scales, i.e. different distances from the central frame. Because the only difference for the convnet configuration is the first convolutional layer having more feature maps, the additional computational cost and number of parameters is small.\nWe found this style of multi-scale training to give small gains. Increasing the context size had a stronger positive impact, though at the expense of increased computational cost."}, {"heading": "2.4. Training", "text": "We use Adadelta [29] and Adam [30] to do initial training of the deep CNNs. Using Adadelta has two main advantages. Firstly, in our experience the optimization problem converges much faster than with SGD; for the Babel experiments we typically see convergence after about 40 million frames using the 18 hours of Babel training data (after silence removal about 5.8 million frames). Secondly, the optimal working point of Adadelta\u2019s hyperparameters and \u03c1 was stable across architectures, always giving optimal performance. This was crucial in order to explore architectural variations. After initial training with Adadelta, we fine tune using SGD with a small learning rate.\nAnother aspect of training that improved our results is data balancing (something similar was done in [6]). We construct batches on the fly by sampling target y = CDi with probability pi, where pi is related to the frequency fi of context dependent state CDi as pi =\nf \u03b3 i\u2211 j f \u03b3 j . After sampling y, we sample uniformly across all\nframes with that target. The exponent \u03b3 takes values between balanced training (\u03b3 = 0) and unbalanced training using the natural frequencies (\u03b3 = 1).\nIn our experiments on Babel it proved optimal to start with \u03b3 = 0 and raise it during training to its final value of \u03b3 = 1. In our experiments on switchboard we varied \u03b3 typically from 0.4 to 0.8 and decoded with HMM priors adjusted to match the final pi distribution."}, {"heading": "3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1. Babel", "text": "Our first set of experiments on Babel focuses on the multilingual and multi-scale aspects of this work. The IARPA Babel program is aimed at developing robust keyword search technology for low resource languages. Though the word error rates reported here are too high to be useful for simple speech to text applications, useful keyword search (KWS) systems can still be built based on these ASR models. The KWS performance is found to generally correlate well with the WER.\nAs training data we use a combination of 6 languages, with 3 hours of training data per language. The languages used for training are languages from the second Option Period of the Babel program, i.e. Kurmanji (KUR), Tok Pisin (TOK), Cebuano (CEB), Kazakh (KAZ), Telugu (TEL), and Lithuanian (LIT). The features used in these experiments are log-Mel features derived from the power spectrum, computed using 25ms windows with a 10ms shift, and standardized with a global mean and variance shared across the speakers and langauges. Unless explicitly mentioned, we use multi-scale features with context \u00b120 in the Babel experiments. We report results after cross-entropy training.\nWe trained the multilingual deep CNN architecture on 6 Babel languages using alignments from 6 baseline speaker independent HMM/DNN systems using PLP features, with 1000 context dependent states. The context dependent states are specific to each language. Each baseline system is cross-entropy trained on a single\nlanguage with 3 hours of data. We will report the WER of the CNNs compared to the baseline DNN, and summarize this in the average absolute WER improvement over the baseline DNN, which gives one number to compare different models. The WER improvements over the baseline DNN are fairly consistent across languages.\nTables 2 through 4 show the results outlining the performance gains from the different architectural improvements discussed in Section 2.1, 2.2, and 2.1 respectively. From table 3 note that even in the monolingual case (3 hours of data) the VBX CNN architecture outperforms both the classical CNN and the baseline DNN."}, {"heading": "3.2. Switchboard 300", "text": "We evaluate our deep CNN architecture by training on the 262- hour SWB-1 training data, and report the Word Error Rates on Hub5\u201900 SWB (table 5). The Switchboard experiments focus on the very deep aspect of our work. Apart from not involving multilingual training, we did not use multi-scale features in the Switchboard experiments, but did use speaker-dependent VTLN and deltas and double deltas as this is shown to help performance for classical CNNs [16].\nIn the switchboard experiments we observed only marginal gains by using a large context, so we only worked with context windows of \u00b18. We define an epoch to be one million frames and trained all our architectures first using adadelta with = 3e\u221211 and \u03c1 = 0.98, for about 40 epochs, while changing \u03b3 from 0.4 to 0.8 at the 25th epoch. We then finetune with SGD (learning rate 1e\u22123 and momentum 0.9) for 200 epochs (Classic and VCX) or 100 epochs (VDX and WDX), before dropping the learning rate to 2e\u22124 and training for a couple more epochs.\nWe only performed cross-entropy training so far, so we compare against the cross-entropy trained CNNs of the best published result so far. The baseline is the work of Soltau et al. [17] using classical CNNs with 512 feature maps on both convolutional layers. A second baseline is the work of Saon et al. [18] which introduces maxout networks with annealed dropout and a large number of CD states to this architecture. Note that these improvements could easily be integrated with our very deep CNN architectures. Though [18] does not provide this number, from personal communication with the authors we learned that the annealed dropout Maxout CNN of table 1 in that paper had a WER of 12.6 after cross-entropy training, which our models slightly improve over.\nNote that the discrepancy between the baseline and our result for the classical 2-layer CNN can be explained by the following differences: our implementation uses only 256 feature maps, ReLU\u2019s instead of sigmoids, larger context of\u00b18, the class-balancing schedule, and different optimization algorithms."}, {"heading": "4. DISCUSSION", "text": "In this paper we proposed a number of architectural advances in CNNs for LVCSR. We introduced a very deep convolutional network architecture with small 3\u00d73 kernels and multiple convolutional layers before each pooling layer, inspired by the VGG Imagenet 2014 architecture. Our best performing model has 14 weight layers. We also introduced multilingual CNNs which proved valuable in the context of low resource speech recognition. We introduced multi-scale input features aimed at exploiting more acoustic context with minimal computational increase. We showed an improvement of 2.50% WER over a standard DNN PLP baseline using 3 hours of data, and an improvement of 5.78% WER by combining six languages to train on 18 hours of data. We then showed results on Hub5\u201900 after training on 262 hours of SWB-1 data where we get 12.2% WER, which is an improvement of 1.6% WER (11.6% relative) over our own baseline, and a 1.0% WER (7.6% relative) improvement over the best result published on classical CNNs after cross-entropy training [17].\nWe expect additional gains from sequence training, joint training with DNNs [17], and integrating improvements like annealed dropout and maxout nonlinearities [18]."}, {"heading": "5.

However, CNNs in LVCSR have not kept pace with recent advances in other domains where deeper neural networks provide superior performance. In this paper we propose a number of architectural advances in CNNs for LVCSR. First, we introduce a very deep convolutional network architecture with up to 14 weight layers. There are multiple convolutional layers before each pooling layer, with small 3\u00d73 kernels, inspired by the VGG Imagenet 2014 architecture. Then, we introduce multilingual CNNs with multiple untied layers. Finally, we introduce multiscale input features aimed at exploiting more context at negligible computational cost. We evaluate the improvements first on a Babel task for low resource speech recognition, obtaining an absolute 5.78% WER improvement over the baseline PLP DNN by training our CNN on the combined data of six different languages. We then evaluate the very deep CNNs on the Hub5\u201900 benchmark (using the 262 hours of SWB-1 training data) achieving a word error rate of 12.2% after cross-entropy training, a 1.6% WER improvement over our own baseline and a 1.0% WER improvement over the best published CNN result so far.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
