Introduction\nIt has been proved that fuzzy systems are useful to simulate a nonlinear system and control.\nThere are mainly two kinds of rule-based fuzzy models: Mamdani fuzzy model and Takagi\u2013Sugeno\n(T-S) fuzzy model. The main difference between them is that the consequence parts of Mamdani\nfuzzy model are fuzzy sets while those of the T-S fuzzy model are linear functions of input variables.\nCompared with Mamdani fuzzy model, T-S fuzzy model can approximate complex nonlinear\nsystems with fewer rules and higher modeling accuracy. Therefore, it becomes an active research\narea. Among the research issues in T-S fuzzy modeling, the identification is the most important and\ncritical one [1]. For the reason that it employs linear model in the consequence part, conventional\nlinear system theory can be applied to the system analysis and synthesis accordingly. Hence, the\nT\u2013S fuzzy models are becoming powerful engineering tools for modeling and control systems [2].\nIn identification of T\u2013S fuzzy models, the structure determination and parameter identification\nare often concerned, i.e., determination of the premise and consequence variables and identification\nof the premise and consequence parameters [3]. Structure identification of fuzzy model is to\ndetermine the number of rules and parameter estimation. The task of structure identification and\nparameter estimation of T-S fuzzy model is to partition the input space into a number of fuzzy\nsubspaces and obtain parameters.\nThere are many methods of structure and parameter identification in fuzzy modeling. Chuen-Tsai\nSun proposed a hill-climbing method based on k-d trees to solve the structure identification problem\n[4]. Other identification methods have also been proposed. For example, the one which combined\nthe clustering-based fuzzy modeling method [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], the approaches of neural-fuzzy\nidentification [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], GA-based fuzzy identification approaches [16, 17, 2] and so\non [18, 19, 20, 21]. However, these identification methods are mainly based on the matching\ndegree-type fuzzy reasoning method.\nThe fuzzy reasoning is an important tool that should process the input information and should\ndetermine a new decision, and fuzzy rules are key factors that guarantee the stability and quality of\nthe system. In addition, the membership function of fuzzy rules is the fundamental element\ninfluencing the result of fuzzy reasoning. Sugeno and Kang discussed the problems of structure\nidentification of a fuzzy model in 1988 [22]. In this method, the main task is to obtain the structure\nand parameters of fuzzy models. So the method is widely applied in fuzzy modeling. However,\nthere is no change in the calculation results for the grade of the membership function when the\nmembership function of fuzzy set is changed.\nThere are disadvantages of matching degree-type fuzzy reasoning method that if the matching\ndegrees are the same for the different inputs, sub reasoning results will also be the same. When it\ncomes to the input is fuzzy singleton (crisp), the sub reasoning results will be the same if the values\nof membership function for the input are the same. In case that the input is a fuzzy set, if the value\nof matching degree for the premise is the same, it will still be the same sub reasoning results despite\nof different membership functions. Therefore, the validity of this method is rather low. The reason\nof misleading reasoning result is that the calculation of membership function is based on\nconsidering the geometrical center as the center of fuzzy set regardless whether the membership\ntypes is symmetric or asymmetric. Therefore, it is necessary to establish new fuzzy reasoning\nmethod to overcome the limitation of the matching degree-type fuzzy reasoning.\nWith this aspect taken into consideration, in this paper, we define a concept of moving rate of\ns-type, z-type and trapezoidal membership function, and compare the efficiency between existing\nmethods and the proposed method. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed method is proved\nby applying the experiment for precipitation forecast and security situation."}, {"heading": "2.

(14) is held, Eq. (15) is satisfied. That is, y0 is a linear equation with a variable zij and parameter aij. The number of variables or parameters is n(m+1). In case that the\nstructure of consequence is given, identification of parameter aij can be LSE (least squares estimator) problem, because Eq. (15) is linear. Of course, the pair of variable zji and output y0 in Eq. (15) is given as data. zji is decided by input xj and weight di, and when the premise has been already given, di is also given.\nOn the other hand, to select the consequence variables in structure identification means to obtain several zji among n(m+1) variables, but it does not simply select several xj among inputs x1 ,\u2026, xm. For example, in case n=2, m=3, considering that the z01, z21, z12, z32 are selected from 8 variables.

(15), to select the variable z0i means that constant clause a0i is in linear equation of consequence. That is, the variable zji is introduced to identify the structures of linear model at the same time. If the number of fuzzy rules isn , then it is necessary to select at least one zji as the variable for any i\u2208[1, n]. In addition, the selection of consequence variable is done using the\nvariable elimination by UC. The method of the variable elimination is the one that firstly making\nthe model by using the whole variables and then eliminating the variables one by one by calculating UC. That is, parameter aji must be identified for structure of each consequence whenever eliminating the variables.\nMethod for the variable elimination is as follows.\nFirst, by applying the whole variables, parameters of consequence are identified, and then the\nvalue of UC for obtained model is written as UC0. Next, the model with one variable eliminated is made and UC1 is calculated. In this case, the number of variables is n(m+1), so the number of models with one variable eliminated is also n(m+1). If UC1 is greater than UC0, we should insert the variable again and eliminate another one, and should newly calculate UC1. If UC1 is smaller than UC0, then eliminating other variable again, making the model and calculating UC2. If the value of UCk-1 is not smaller than UCk, in the case that k variables are eliminated, the structure of the consequence for UCk becomes an optimal one."}, {"heading": "3.3. Identification of premise", "text": "The main difficulty in fuzzy modeling is identification of premise. The identification step of\npremise consists of the identification steps for the structure and the parameters. The identification of\nstructure consists of selection of fuzzy variables for premise and fuzzy partition for variable space.\nBefore considering the identification for premise structure, firstly consider the parameter\nidentification where the premise parameter is the coordinate of x-axis a1, a2, a3, a4 characterizing the membership function (Figure 6).\nWhen the parameter values for all premise fuzzy variables are given, the output y0 for weight d i\nis obtained. Under this condition, the optimal structure and the consequence parameters are\nidentified.\nIn order to decide the premise parameters, searching minimal parameter value is needed. To\navoid the complexity of computation, there is no need to select the consequence structure. In this\ncase, level 0 is used. That means all the input variables in premise parameter identification. Then, the consequence parameter can be decided using LSE. Namely, aji is obtained by using input-output data in Eq. (15).\nThe standard for premise parameter identification is to select the one that the sum of square of\noutput error in Eq. (15) is minimum or the weight coefficient is maximum. In other words, the\nobjective function for premise parameter identification is to minimize the sum of square of output\nerror in Eq. (15) or to maximize the weight coefficient. These do not really depend on the consequence parameter aji. In general, the parameters by calculating the differentiation of objective function may be estimated. However, in Eq. (15), there exists non-differential operation for absolute\nand min operation.
