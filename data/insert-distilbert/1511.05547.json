Humans are able to learn from very few labeled examples and apply the learned knowledge to new examples in novel conditions. In contrast, supervised machine learning methods only perform well when the given extensive labeled data are from the same distribution as the test distribution. Both theoretical (Ben-David et al. 2007; Blitzer, Dredze, and Pereira 2007) and practical results (Saenko et al. 2010; Torralba and Efros 2011) have shown that the test error of supervised methods generally increases in proportion to the \u201cdifference\u201d between the distributions of training and test examples. For example, Donahue et al. (2014) showed that even state-of-the-art Deep Convolutional Neural Network features learned on a dataset of 1.2M images are susceptible to domain shift. Addressing domain shift is undoubtedly critical for successfully applying machine learning methods in real world applications.\nTo compensate for the degradation in performance due to domain shift, many domain adaptation algorithms have been\ndeveloped, most of which assume that some labeled examples in the target domain are provided to learn the proper model adaptation. Daume III (2007) proposed a supervised domain adaptation approach notable for its extreme simplicity: it merely changes the features by making domainspecific and common copies, then trains a supervised classifier on the new features from both domains. The method performs very well, yet is \u201cfrustratingly easy\u201d to implement. However, it cannot be applied in the situations where the target domain is unlabeled, which unfortunately are quite common in practice.\nIn this work, we present a \u201cfrustratingly easy\u201d unsupervised domain adaptation method called CORrelation ALignment (CORAL). CORAL aligns the input feature distributions of the source and target domains by exploring their second-order statistics. More concretely, CORAL aligns the distributions by re-coloring whitened source features with the covariance of the target distribution. CORAL is simple and efficient, as the only computations it needs are (1) computing covariance statistics in each domain and (2) applying the whitening and re-coloring linear transformation to the source features. Then, supervised learning proceeds as usual\u2013training a classifier on the transformed source features.\nDespite being \u201cfrustratingly easy\u201d, CORAL offers surprisingly good performance on standard adaptation tasks. We apply it to two tasks: object recognition and sentiment prediction (Figure 1), and show that it outperforms\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n05 54\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n7 N\nov 2\n01 5\nmany existing methods. For object recognition, we demonstrate that it works well with both standard \u201cflat\u201d bag-ofwords features and with state-of-the-art deep CNN features (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2012), outperforming existing methods, including recent deep CNN adaptation approaches (Tzeng et al. 2014; Ganin and Lempitsky 2015; Long et al. 2015). The latter approaches are quite complex and expensive, requiring re-training of the network and tuning of many hyperparameters such as the structure of the hidden adaptation layers. In contrast, CORAL only needs to compute the covariance of the source and target features."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Domain shift is a fundamental problem in machine learning, and has also attracted a lot of attention in the speech, natural language and vision communities. For supervised adaptation, a variety of techniques have been proposed. Some consider the source domain as a prior that regularizes the learning problem in the sparsely labeled target domain, e.g., (Yang, Yan, and Hauptmann 2007). Others minimize the distance between the target and source domains, either by re-weighting the domains or by changing the feature representation according to some explicit distribution distance metric (Borgwardt et al. 2006). Some learn a transformation on features using a contrastive loss (Saenko et al. 2010). Arguably the simplest and most prominent supervised approach is the \u201cfrustratingly easy\u201d feature replication (Daume III 2007). Given a feature vector x, it defines the augmented feature vector x\u0303 = (x;x;0) for data points in the source and x\u0303 = (x;0;x) for data points in the target. A classifier is then trained on augmented features. This approach is simple, however, it requires labeled target examples, which are often not available in real world applications.\nEarly techniques for unsupervised adaptation consisted of re-weighting the training point losses to more closely reflect those in the test distribution (Jiang and Zhai 2007; Huang et al. 2006). Dictionary learning methods (Shekhar et al. 2013; Huang and Wang 2013) try to learn a dictionary where the difference between the source and target domain is minimized in the new representation. Recent state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches (Gopalan, Li, and Chellappa 2011; Gong et al. 2012; Long et al. 2014; Caseiro et al. 2015) have pursued adaptation by projecting the source and target distributions into a lower-dimensional manifold, and finding a transformation that brings the subspaces closer together. Geodesic methods find a path along the subspace manifold, and either project source and target onto points along that path (Gopalan, Li, and Chellappa 2011), or find a closedform linear map that projects source points to target (Gong et al. 2012). Alternatively, the subspaces can be aligned by computing the linear map that minimizes the Frobenius norm of the difference between them (Harel and Mannor 2011; Fernando et al. 2013). However, these approaches only align the bases of the subspaces, not the distribution of the projected points. They also require expensive subspace projection and hyperparameter selection.\nAdaptive deep neural networks have recently been explored for unsupervised adaptation.

ReverseGrad (Ganin and Lempitsky 2015), DAN (Long et al. 2015), and DDC (Tzeng et al. 2014) directly optimize the deep representation for domain invariance, using additional loss layers designed for this purpose. Training with this additional loss is costly and can be sensitive to initialization, network structure, and other optimization settings. Our approach, applied to deep features (top layer activations), achieves better or comparable performance to these more complex methods, and can be incorporated directly into the network structure."}, {"heading": "3 Correlation Alignment for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation", "text": "We present an extremely simple domain adaptation method\u2013 CORrelation ALignment (CORAL)\u2013which works by aligning the distributions of the source and target features in an unsupervised manner.

Suppose we are given source-domain training examples DS = {xi}, x \u2208 RD\nwith labels LS = {yi}, y \u2208 {1, ..., L}, and target data DT = {ui}, u \u2208 RD. Here both x and u are the Ddimensional feature representations \u03c6(I) of input I . Suppose \u00b5s, \u00b5t and CS , CT are the feature vector means and covariance matrices. As illustrated in Figure 2, \u00b5t = \u00b5s = 0 after feature normalization while CS 6= CT .\nTo minimize the distance between the second-order statistics (covariance) of the source and target features, we apply a linear transformation A to the original source features and use the Frobenius norm as the matrix distance metric:\nmin A \u2016CS\u0302 \u2212 CT \u2016 2 F\n= min A \u2016A>CSA\u2212 CT \u2016\n2\nF\n(1)\nwhere CS\u0302 is covariance of the transformed source features DsA and \u2016 \u00b7 \u20162F denotes the matrix Frobenius norm.\nIf rank(CS) \u2265 rank(CT ), then an analytical solution can be obtained by choosing A such that CS\u0302 = CT . However, the data typically lie on a lower dimensional manifold (Harel and Mannor 2011; Gong et al. 2012; Fernando et al. 2013), and so the covariance matrices are likely to be low rank (Hariharan, Malik, and Ramanan 2012). We derive a solution for this general case, using the following lemma. Lemma 1. (Cai, Cande\u0300s, and Shen 2010) Let Y be a real matrix of rank rY and X a real matrix of rank at most r, where r 6 rY ; let Y = UY \u03a3Y VY be the SVD of Y , and \u03a3Y [1:r], UY [1:r], VY [1:r] be the largest r singular values and the corresponding left and right singular vectors of Y respectively. Then, X\u2217 = UY [1:r]\u03a3Y [1:r]VY [1:r]\n> is the optimal solution to the problem of min\nX \u2016X \u2212 Y \u20162F .\nTheorem 1. Let \u03a3+ be the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of \u03a3, rCS and rCT denote the rank of CS and CT respectively. Then, A\u2217 = US\u03a3+S 1 2US >UT [1:r]\u03a3T [1:r] 1 2UT [1:r]\n> is the optimal solution to the problem in Equation (1) with r = min(rCS , rCT ).\nProof. Since A is a linear transformation, A>CSA does not increase the rank of CS . Thus, rCS\u0302 6 rCS . Since CS and CT are symmetric matrices, conducting SVD on CS and CT gives CS = US\u03a3SUS> and CT = UT \u03a3TU>T respectively. We first find the optimal value of CS\u0302 through considering the following two cases: Case 1. rCS > rCT . The optimal solution is CS\u0302 = CT . Thus, CS\u0302 = UT \u03a3TUT > = UT [1:r]\u03a3T [1:r]UT [1:r] > is the optimal solution to Equation (1) where r = rCT .\nCase 2. rCS 6 rCT . Then, according to Lemma 1, CS\u0302 = UT [1:r]\u03a3T [1:r]UT [1:r]\n> is the optimal solution to Equation (1) where r = rCS .\nCombining the results in the above two cases yields that CS\u0302 = UT [1:r]\u03a3T [1:r]UT [1:r]\n> is the optimal solution to Equation (1) with r = min(rCS , rCT ). We then proceed to solve for A based on the above result. Let CS\u0302 = A\n>CSA, and we get:\nA>CSA = UT [1:r]\u03a3T [1:r]UT [1:r] >.\nSince CS = US\u03a3SUS>, we have\nA>US\u03a3SUS >A = UT [1:r]\u03a3T [1:r]UT [1:r] >.\nThis gives:\n(US >A) > \u03a3S(US >A) = UT [1:r]\u03a3T [1:r]UT [1:r] >.\nLet E = \u03a3+S 1 2US >UT [1:r]\u03a3T [1:r] 1 2UT [1:r] >, then the right hand side of the above equation can be re-written as E>\u03a3SE. This gives\n(US >A) > \u03a3S(US >A) = E>\u03a3SE\nBy setting US>A to E, we get the optimal solution of A as\nA\u2217 = USE\n= (US\u03a3 + S 1 2US >)(UT [1:r]\u03a3T [1:r] 1 2UT [1:r]\n>). (2)"}, {"heading": "3.2 Algorithm", "text": "We can think of transformation A in this way intuitively: the first part US\u03a3+S 1 2US\n> whitens the source data while the second part UT [1:r]\u03a3T [1:r] 1 2UT [1:r]\n> re-colors it with the target covariance. This is illustrated in Figure 2(b) and Figure 2(c) respectively. The traditional whitening is adding a small regularization parameter \u03bb to the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix to explicitly make it full rank and then multiply the original feature by the inverse square root (or square root for coloring) of it. The whitening and re-coloring here are slightly different from them since the data are likely to lie on a lower dimensional space and the covariance matrices could be low rank.\nIn practice, for the sake of efficiency and stability, we can perform the classical whitening and coloring. This is advantageous because: (1) it is faster (e.g., the whole CORAL transformation takes less than one minute on a regular laptop for DS \u2208 R795\u00d74096 and DT \u2208 R2817\u00d74096) and more stable, as SVD on the original covariance matrices might not be stable and might slow to converge; (2) as illustrated in Figure 3, the performance is similar to the analytical solution in Equation (2) and very stable with respect to \u03bb. In this paper, we set \u03bb to 1. The final algorithm can be written in four lines of MATLAB code as illustrated in Algorithm 1.\nOne might instead attempt to align the distributions by whitening both source and target. As shown in Figure 2(d),\nAlgorithm 1 CORAL for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Input: Source Data DS , Target Data DT Output: Adjusted Source Data D\u2217s CS = cov(DS) + eye(size(DS , 2)) CT = cov(DT ) + eye(size(DT , 2))\nDS = DS \u2217 C \u22121 2 S % whitening source D\u2217S = DS \u2217 C 1 2 T % re-coloring with target covariance\nthis will fail as the source and target data are likely to lie on different subspaces due to domain shift. An alternative approach would be whitening the target and then re-coloring it with the source covariance. However, as demonstrated in (Harel and Mannor 2011; Fernando et al. 2013) and our experiments, transforming data from source to target space gives better performance. This might be due to the fact that by transforming the source to target space the classifier was trained using both the label information from the source and the unlabelled structure from the target.\nAfter CORAL transforms the source features to the target space, a classifier fw parametrized by w can be trained on the adjusted source features and directly applied to target features. For a linear classifier fw(I) = wT\u03c6(I), we can apply an equivalent transformation to the parameter vector w instead of the features u. This results in added efficiency when the number of classifiers is small but the number and dimensionality of target examples is very high.\nSince correlation alignment changes the features only, it can be applied to any base classifier. Due to its efficiency, it can also be especially advantageous when the target domains are changing rapidly, e.g., due to scene changes over the course of a long video stream."}, {"heading": "3.3 Relationship to Existing Methods", "text": "Relationship to Feature Normalization It has long been known that input feature normalization improves many machine learning methods, e.g., (Ioffe and Szegedy 2015). However, CORAL does not simply perform feature normalization, but rather aligns two different distributions. Standard feature normalization (zero mean and unit variance) does not address this issue, as illustrated in Figure 2(a). In this example, although the features are normalized to have zero mean and unit variance in each dimension, the differences in correlations present in the source and target domains cause the distributions to be different.\nRelationship to Manifold Methods Recent state-of-theart unsupervised approaches project the source and target distributions into a lower-dimensional manifold and find a transformation that brings the subspaces closer together (Gopalan, Li, and Chellappa 2011; Gong et al. 2012; Fernando et al. 2013; Harel and Mannor 2011). CORAL avoids subspace projection, which can be costly and requires selecting the hyper-parameter that controls the dimensionality of the subspace. We note that subspace-mapping approaches (Harel and Mannor 2011; Fernando et al. 2013) only align the top k (subspace dimensionality) eigenvectors\nof the source and target covariance matrices. On the contrary, CORAL aligns the covariance matrices, which can only be re-constructed using all eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Even though the eigenvectors can be aligned well, the distributions can still differ a lot due to the difference of eigenvalues between the corresponding eigenvectors of the source and target data. CORAL is a more general and much simpler method than the above two as it takes into account both eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix without the burden of subspace dimensionality selection.\nRelationship to MMD methods Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) based methods (e.g., (Pan et al. 2009; Long et al. 2015)) for domain adaptation can be interpreted as \u201cmoment matching\u201d and can express arbitrary statistics of the data. Minimizing MMD with polynomial kernel (k(x, y) = (1 + x\u2032y)d with d = 2) is similar to the CORAL objective, however, no previous work has used this kernel for domain adaptation nor proposed a closed form solution to the best of our knowledge. The other difference is that MMD based approaches usually apply the same transformation to both the source and target domain. As demonstrated in (Kulis, Saenko, and Darrell 2011; Harel and Mannor 2011; Fernando et al. 2013), asymmetric transformations are more flexible and often yield better performance for domain adaptation tasks. Intuitively, symmetric transformations find a space that \u201cignores\u201d the differences between the source and target domain while asymmetric transformations try to \u201cbridge\u201d the two domains."}, {"heading": "3.4 Application to Deep Neural Networks", "text": "Suppose \u03c6(I) was computed by a multilayer neural network, then the inputs to each layer \u03c6k can suffer from covariate shift as well. Batch Normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy 2015) tries to compensate for internal covariate shift by normalizing each mini-batch to be zero-mean and unitvariance. However, as illustrated in Figure 2, such normalization might not be enough. Even if used with full whitening, Batch Normalization may not compensate for external covariate shift: the layer activations will be decorrelated for a source point but not for a target point. What\u2019s more, as mentioned in Section 3.2, whitening both domains still does not work. Our method can be easily integrated into a deep architecture by treating layers as features (e.g., fc6 or fc7 of AlexNet (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2012)). Although we experiment only with CORAL applied to one hidden layer at each time, multilayer CORAL could be used by implementing the transformations Al as extra layers which follow each original layer l."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "We evaluate our method on object recognition (Gong et al. 2012; Fernando et al. 2013; Gopalan, Li, and Chellappa 2011; Kulis, Saenko, and Darrell 2011; Saenko et al. 2010) and sentiment analysis (Blitzer, Dredze, and Pereira 2007) with both shallow and deep features, using standard benchmarks and protocols. In all experiments we assume the target\ndomain is unlabeled. We follow the standard procedure (Fernando et al. 2013; Donahue et al. 2014) and use a linear SVM as the base classifier. The model selection approach of (Fernando et al. 2013) is used to set the C parameter for the SVM by doing cross-validation on the source domain. Since there are no other hyperparameters (except the common regularization parameter \u03bb for whitening and coloring, which we discussed in Section 3.2 and Figure 3) required for our method, the results in this paper can be easily reproduced. To compare to published methods, we use the accuracies reported by their authors or conduct experiments using the source code provided by the authors."}, {"heading": "4.1 Object Recognition", "text": "In this set of experiments, domain adaptation is used to improve the accuracy of an object classifier on novel image domains. Both the standard Office (Saenko et al. 2010) and extended Office-Caltech10 (Gong et al. 2012) datasets are used as benchmarks in this paper. Office-Caltech10 contains 10 object categories from an office environment (e.g., keyboard, laptop, etc.) in 4 image domains: Webcam, DSLR, Amazon, and Caltech256. The standard Office dataset contains 31 (the same 10 categories from Office-Caltech10 plus 21 additional ones) object categories in 3 domains: Webcam, DSLR, and Amazon.\nObject Recognition with Shallow Features The OfficeCaltech10 dataset is the standard benchmark (Gong et al. 2012; Fernando et al. 2013; Gopalan, Li, and Chellappa 2011; Kulis, Saenko, and Darrell 2011; Saenko et al. 2010) for domain adaptation with shallow features (SURF) in object recognition. The SURF features were encoded with 800-bin bag-of-words histograms and normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation in each dimension. Since there are four domains, there are 12 experiment settings, namely, A\u2192C (train classifier on (A)mazon, test on (C)altech), A\u2192D (train on (A)mazon, test on (D)SLR), A\u2192W, and so on. We follow the standard protocol of (Gong et al. 2012; Fernando et al. 2013; Gopalan, Li, and Chellappa 2011; Kulis, Saenko, and Darrell 2011; Saenko et al. 2010) and conduct experiments in 20 randomized trials for each domain shift and average the accuracy over the trials. In each trial, we use the standard setting (Gong et al. 2012; Fernando et al. 2013; Gopalan, Li, and Chellappa 2011; Kulis, Saenko, and Darrell 2011; Saenko et al. 2010) and randomly sample the same number (20 for Amazon, Caltech, and Webcam; 8 for DSLR as there are only 8 images per category in the DSLR domain) of labelled images in the source domain as training set, and use all the unlabelled data in the target domain as the test set.\nResults In Table 1, we compare our method to five recent published methods: SVMA (Duan, Tsang, and Xu 2012), DAM (Duan et al. 2009), GFK (Gong et al. 2012), SA (Fernando et al. 2013), and TCA (Pan et al. 2009) as well as the no adaptation baseline (NA). GFK, SA, and TCA are manifold based methods that project the source and target\ndistributions into a lower-dimensional manifold. GFK integrates over an infinite number of subspaces along the subspace manifold using the kernel trick. SA aligns the source and target subspaces by computing a linear map that minimizes the Frobenius norm of their difference. TCA performs domain adaptation via a new parametric kernel using feature extraction methods by projecting data onto the learned transfer components. DAM introduces smoothness assumption to enforce the target classifier share similar decision values with the source classifiers. Even though these methods are far more complicated than ours and require tuning of hyperparameters (e.g., subspace dimensionality), our method achieves the best average performance across all the 12 domain shifts. Our method also improves on the no adaptation baseline (NA), in some cases increasing accuracy significantly (from 56% to 86% for D\u2192W).\nObject Recognition with Deep Features The Office dataset is the standard benchmark (Donahue et al. 2014; Tzeng et al. 2014; Ganin and Lempitsky 2015) for domain adaptation with deep features in object recognition. DECAF (Donahue et al. 2014) uses AlexNet (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2012) pre-trained on ImageNet (Deng et al. 2009) and extracts the fc6 or fc7 layers in the source domains as features to train a classifier. It then applies the classifier to the target domain directly. DDC (Tzeng et al. 2014) adds a domain confusion loss to AlexNet (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2012) and fine-tunes it on both the source and target domain. DAN (Long et al. 2015) and ReverseGrad (Ganin and Lempitsky 2015) are the two most recent domain adaptation approaches based on deep architectures. DAN is similar to DDC but utilizes multi-kernel selection method for better mean embedding matching and adapts in multiple layers. ReverseGrad introduces a gradient reversal layer to allow direct optimization through backpropagation. Both DDC and ReverseGrad add a new binary classification task by treating the source and target domain as two classes. They maximize the binary classification loss to obtain invariant features.\nTo have a fair comparison, we apply CORAL to both the pre-trained AlexNet (CORAL-fc6 and CORAL-fc7) and to AlexNet fine-tuned on the source (CORAL-FT6 and CORAL-FT7). However, the fine-tuning procedures of DDC, DAN, and ReverseGrad are very complicated as there is more than one loss and hyper-parameters are needed to combine them. They also require adding new layers and data from both source and target domains. We use standard fine-tuning on the source domain only to get the baseline NA results (NA-FT6 and NA-FT7). Since there are three domains, there are 6 experiment settings. We follow the protocol of (Donahue et al. 2014; Tzeng et al. 2014; Ganin and Lempitsky 2015) and conduct experiments on 5 random training/test splits and get the mean accuracy for each domain shift.\nResults In Table 2 we compare our method to three (SA, GFK, TCA) of the methods in Table 1 which have available source code, seven recent published deep structure based methods: DLID (Chopra, Balakrishnan, and Gopalan\n2013), DANN (Ghifary, Kleijn, and Zhang 2014), DANBNN (Tommasi and Caputo 2013), DECAF (Donahue et al. 2014), DDC (Tzeng et al. 2014), DAN (Long et al. 2015) and ReverseGrad (Ganin and Lempitsky 2015) as well as four no adaptation baselines (NA-fc6, NA-fc7, NA-FT6, and NA-FT7). DLID trains a joint source and target CNN architecture with an \u201cinterpolating path\u201d between the source and target domain. DANN incorporates the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) measure as a regularization to reduce the distribution mismatch. DA-NBNN presents an NBNNbased domain adaptation algorithm that iteratively learns a class metric while inducing a large margin separation among\nclasses. Again, our method outperforms all of these techniques in almost all cases, sometimes by a very large margin. We also noticed that most of the deep structures based methods only report results on some settings, possibly due to computation cost.\nOne interesting finding is that, although fine-tuning on the source domain only (NA-FT6 and NA-FT7) does not achieve better performance on the target domain compared to the pre-trained network (NA-fc6 and NA-fc7), applying CORAL to the fine-tuned network (CORAL-FT6 and CORAL-FT7) achieves much better performance than applying CORAL to the pre-trained network (CORAL-fc6 and CORAL-fc7). One possible explanation is that the pretrained network might be underfitting while the fine-tuned network is overfitting. Since CORAL aligns the source feature distribution to target distribution, overfitting becomes\nless of a problem.\nA Larger Scale Evaluation In this section, we repeat the evaluation on a larger scale. We conduct two sets of experiments to investigate how the dataset size and number of classes will affect the performance of domain adaptation methods. For the investigation of dataset size, we use the \u201cfully-transductive\u201d protocol, where all the source data are used for training, compared to the standard subsampling protocol in the previous two sections. Since all the target data are used in the previous two sections, the only difference between the settings is the training dataset size of the source domain. To investigate the effect of the number of classes, we use the Testbed Cross-Dataset (Tommasi and Tuytelaars 2014) dataset and conduct experiments on all the 6 shifts. To have a direct comparison to Table 1, we first conduct experiments on the Office-Caltech10 dataset with SURF features using the \u201cfully-transductive\u201d protocol. To investigate the performance of deep features, we also conduct experiments on the Testbed Cross-Dataset with the only deep feature (DECAF-fc7) released by the authors.\nResults In Tables 3 and 4, we compare CORAL to SA, GFK, TCA as well as the NA baseline. Table 3 shows the result of the Office-Caltech10 dataset using the \u201cfullytransductive\u201d protocol and Table 4 shows the result on the Testbed Cross-Dataset dataset with the same protocol. In both experiments, CORAL outperforms all the baseline methods and again the margin on deep features is much larger than on shallow features. Comparing Table 3 to Table 1, we can say that the performance difference between NA and other methods is smaller as more source data is used. This may be due to the fact that as more training data is used, the intraclass difference is getting larger and the classifier needs to focus more on the \u201cessence\u201d of an object."}, {"heading": "4.2 Sentiment Analysis", "text": "We also evaluate our method on sentiment analysis using the standard Amazon review dataset (Blitzer, Dredze, and Pereira 2007; Gong, Grauman, and Sha 2013). We use the processed data from (Gong, Grauman, and Sha 2013), in which the dimensionality of the bag-of-words features was reduced to keep the top 400 words without losing performance. This dataset contains Amazon reviews on 4 domains: Kitchen appliances, DVD, Books, and Electronics. For each domain, there are 1000 positive and 1000 negative reviews. We follow the standard protocol of (Gong, Grauman, and Sha 2013) and conduct experiments on 20 random training/test splits and report the mean accuracy for each domain shift.\nResults In Table 5, we compare our method to five published methods: TCA (Pan et al. 2009), GFS (Gopalan, Li, and Chellappa 2011), GFK (Gong et al. 2012), SCL (Blitzer, McDonald, and Pereira 2006), and KMM (Huang et al. 2006) as well as the no adaptation baseline (NA). GFS is a precursor of GFK and interpolates features using a finite number of subspaces. SCL introduces structural correspondence learning to automatically induce correspondences\namong features from different domains. KMM presents a nonparametric method to directly produce re-sampling weights without distribution estimation. One interesting observation is that, for this sentiment analysis task, three stateof-the-art methods (TCA, GFS, and GFK) actually perform worse than the no adaptation baseline (NA). Despite the difficulty of this task, CORAL still performs well and achieves the best average classification accuracy across the 4 standard domain shifts."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "From Tables 1-5 we can see that, even though CORAL is extremely simple, it outperforms all 16 baseline methods on all four standard domain adaptation benchmarks using both bag-of-words and deep features.\nOne interesting result is that the margin between CORAL and other published methods is much larger on deep features (e.g. 64.0 of CORAL-fc6 compared to 49.1 of SA-fc6) than on bag-of-words features. This could be because deep features are more strongly correlated than bag-of-words features (e.g. the largest singular value of the covariance matrix of Amazon-fc6 is 354 compared to 27 of Amazon-SURF). Similarly, the improvement on images (Tables 1-4) is much larger than text (Table 5), possibly because bag-of-words text features are extremely sparse and less correlated than image features. As demonstrated in (Mahendran and Vedaldi 2015), high level deep features are more \u201cparts\u201d or \u201cobjects\u2019. Intuitively, \u201cparts\u201d or \u201cobjects\u201d should be more strongly correlated than \u201cedges\u201d (e.g., arm and head of a person are more likely to appear jointly).\nThese findings suggest that CORAL is extremely valuable in the era of deep learning. Applying CORAL to deep text features is part of future work."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this article, we proposed an simple, efficient and effective method for domain adaptation. The method is \u201cfrustratingly easy\u201d to implement: the only computation involved is recoloring the whitened source features with the covariance of the target domain.\nExtensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over many existing state-of-the-art methods. These results confirm that CORAL is applicable to multiple features types, including highlyperforming deep features, and to different tasks, including computer vision and natural language processing."}, {"heading": "7 Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors would like to thank Mingsheng Long, Judy Hoffman, and Trevor Darrell for helpful discussions and suggestions; the reviewers for their valuable comments.
