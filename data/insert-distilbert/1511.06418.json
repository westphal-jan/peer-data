Distributed representations (Hinton, 1984) are far more expressive than local ones, requiring exponentially fewer features to capture the same space. Complementary to that, disentangling (Barlow et al., 1989; Schmidhuber, 1992; Bengio et al., 2007) requires the factors of variation in the data to be separated into different independent features. This concept is closely related to invariance and eases further processing because many properties, that we might be interested in, are invariant under a wide variety of transformations (Bengio et al., 2013a). Unfortunately distributed representations can interfere and lead to ambiguities when multiple objects are to be represented at the same time.\nThe binding problem refers to these ambiguities that can arise from the superposition of multiple distributed representations. This problem has been debated quite extensively in the neuroscience and psychology communities perhaps starting with Milner (1974) and von der Malsburg (1981), but its existence can be traced back at least to a description by Rosenblatt (1961). It is classically demonstrated with a system required to identify an input as either square( ) or triangle(4) and to decide whether it is at the top(\u2191) or at the bottom(\u2193). It represents every object as a distributed representation with two active disentangled features (see Figure 1b). The binding problem arises when the system is presented with two objects at the same time: In this scenario, all four features become active and from the representation alone it cannot be determined whether the input contains a square on top and a triangle at the bottom or vice versa.\nOne way the system can circumvent this problem is through the use of a local representation, with one feature for each combination of shape and position: 4\u2191,4\u2193, \u2191, \u2193. Sadly the size of such a purely local-representation scales exponentially with the number of factors to represent. In contrast, distributed representations (Hinton, 1984) are much more expressive and can generalize better through the reuse of features. The former system could, for example, correctly represent the position for a new object such as a circle by the already available position features (\u2191\u2193). Generalization of internal representations is a crucial capability of any intelligent system, and one that still sets humans apart from current machine learning systems. Consider Figure 1a, an example from studies in psychology: chances are this is the first time you see a Greeble (Gauthier & Tarr, 1997). Nevertheless, you are capable of describing its shape, texture, and color. Moreover, you can easily segment it and tell it apart from the background, without having seen any other Greeble before.\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n06 41\n8v 4\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n0 Ja\nn 20\n16\nIt has long been argued that such generalization capabilities are a result of the use of distributed representations in the human brain.\nDespite its importance to the neuroscience community, binding has received relatively little attention in representation learning. Two important reasons for this are:\nFirstly, most pattern recognition tasks and benchmarks are set up to avoid the binding problem. Many popular visual pattern recognition datasets consist of images that contain only one object at a time. Similarly, speech recognition mostly considers recordings of just one speaker talking and little background noise. In these settings, a machine learning algorithm can assume that there is only a single prominent object of interest, reducing the binding problem to the problem of ignoring irrelevant details. When tackling more challenging problems such as image caption generation, scene parsing segmentation, or the cocktail party problem, the deficiencies of popular methods become more apparent and restrictive.\nSecondly, the recent increase in processing power due to the use of Graphics Processing Units made it feasible to mitigate the binding problem using localized binding in the form of convolutions (Riesenhuber & Poggio, 1999). Convolutional Networks (Fukushima, 1979; Le Cun et al., 1990) use feature detectors with limited receptive fields (filters) replicated over the whole input to represent its inputs. Therefore the resulting features of spatially separated objects do not interact: they are invariant to changes outside their field of view. On the other hand, they do not disentangle the location from the detected pattern, which comes at the cost of having to compute the same feature replicated many times over the image. While this is reasonable for low-level features like edges, it seems wasteful to replicate specialized high-level features such as dog-faces.\nIn this paper, we develop an unsupervised method that dynamically binds features of different objects together. This is in contrast to local representations which by nature statically bind several input features together (a feature for \u2191 permanently binds the concepts and \u2191 together). It explicitly models inputs as a composition of multiple entities and recovers these \u201cobjects\u201d using the notion of mutual predictability. This is achieved through a clustering process which utilizes a denoising autoencoder (DAE; Behnke, 2001; Vincent et al., 2008) to iteratively reconstruct an input. In the future, such a mechanism could help to effectively use distributed representations in multi-object settings without being impaired by the ambiguities due to superposition. Alternative approaches to the binding problem proposed in the literature are discussed in Section 5."}, {"heading": "2 RECONSTRUCTION CLUSTERING", "text": "This section describes Reconstruction Clustering (RC), a formal framework for tackling the binding problem as a clustering problem. For ease of explanation we will refer to inputs as images and the individual dimensions of an input as pixels, though the framework is not restricted to visual inputs. It is based upon two insights: Firstly, if the image was segmented into its constituent objects, there would be no binding problem. Secondly, the intuitive notion of an object can be formalized as a group of mutually predictive pixels. The proposed method therefore iteratively clusters pixels based on how well they predict each other."}, {"heading": "2.1 IMAGES AS COMPOSITIONS", "text": "The first central idea behind RC is to model images as being composed of several independent objects with each pixel belonging to one of them. Unlike in classic segmentation where each pixel is assigned to a predefined class, the goal here is to simply segregate different objects. In doing so we avoid all ambiguities that might arise from a superposition of their representations. Of course, the information about which objects are present and which pixels they consist of is unknown in practical applications. So for each image, the aim is to infer both the object representations and the corresponding pixel assignments.\nFormally, we introduce a binary latent vector zi for each pixel xi that specifies which of the K objects it belongs to. Therefore, zi = (zi1, zi2, . . . , ziK) \u2208 {0, 1}K with the constraint that \u2211K k=1 zik = 1. Let N \u2208 N denote the number of pixels in the image x = {x1, . . . , xN}. Then we define the prior over Z = {z1, . . . , zN} as:\nP (Z|\u03c0) = N\u220f i=1 P (zi|\u03c0) = N\u220f i=1 K\u220f k=1 \u03c0zikk , (1)\nwhere the zi\u2019s are assumed to be independent given \u03c0 = {\u03c01, . . . , \u03c0K}. The assumed probabilistic structure is shown in Figure 2a. We assume \u03c0 to be uniformly distributed for simplicity, but its estimation can be incorporated into the algorithm if required (see Appendix)."}, {"heading": "2.2 OBJECTS", "text": "So far, we have used the word object to describe a group of pixels that somehow \u201cbelong together\u201d. The second central idea of RC is to concretize that notion using mutual predictability of the pixels. Intuitively, knowing about some pixel values that belong to an object helps in predicting the others. An example can be seen in Figure 1c where the corrupted pixels in the bottom left corner of the square could be reconstructed from knowledge about the rest of the square, but not from any of the triangles. So we define an object as a group of pixels that help in predicting each other, but do not carry information about pixels outside of that group.\nPredictability, as we use it here, is derived from the structure of the underlying data-distribution. Knowledge about this structure is also precisely what is needed in order to remove corruption from an image. Based on this insight, we propose to use a denoising autoencoder (DAE) to measure predictability."}, {"heading": "2.3 DENOISING AUTOENCODER", "text": "Let f be the encoder and g be the decoder of a DAE, such that \u03b8 = f(x) is the encoded representation of input x and \u00b5 = g(\u03b8) is the decoded output. The DAE is trained to remove corruption from images of single objects and thus learns a local model of the data generating distribution (Vincent et al., 2008; Bengio et al., 2013b). After training the same DAE is used for each of the clusters to get predictions \u00b5ik from cluster k for pixel i, where the object in cluster k is represented by \u03b8k:\nP (x|\u03b8k) = N\u220f i=1 P (xi|\u03b8k) = N\u220f i=1 P (xi|\u00b5ik) (2)\nHere xi\u2019s are assumed to be independent given \u00b5.

The R-Step is thus given by the following formula, where denotes point-wise multiplication:\n\u03b8k = f(\u03b3k x), (5)\nUnfortunately this step can not be guaranteed to increase the expected log-likelihood, because only in expectation does the DAE map from regions of low likelihood to regions of higher likelihood. Moreover, this property only holds for the whole image and not for all subsets of pixels. Thus, convergence can\u2019t be proven and RC is not an Expectation Maximization algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977). Nevertheless, empirical results show that convergence does occur reliably (Section 4.2)."}, {"heading": "2.4.2 ESTIMATION STEP", "text": "In the E-step, for each pixel xi the posterior \u03b3ik of Z, given the data and the predictions \u00b5i = {g(\u03b81)i, . . . , g(\u03b8K)i} of the autoencoders based on the object representations, is\n\u03b3ik = P (zik = 1|xi,\u00b5i,\u03c0) = P (xi|zik = 1,\u00b5i)P (zik = 1|\u03c0)\nP (xi|\u00b5i,\u03c0) .

The likelihood is much lower for k = 2 than for k = 3 and drops again slightly if we choose k = 5. The likelihood for k = 12 is significantly lower.

Therefore, it is instructive to examine the relationship between denoising performance and the final RC binding score. For this purpose, we trained 100 DAEs with the same architecture on each dataset with random learning rates and initializations, and then performed RC using each of them. Figure 6a shows the relationship between the denoising loss and binding score for each dataset. It can be observed that lower loss correlates positively with higher score for all datasets, indicating that denoising is a suitable surrogate training objective. We added a regression line to indicate that relation for each dataset, even though for MNIST+Shape and Multi MNIST it doesn\u2019t look even remotely linear. Instead, the individual points are approximately arranged on a curve. This suggests that there is a direct but complex interplay between the denoising performance and the score."}, {"heading": "4.5 TRAINING ON MULTIPLE OBJECTS", "text": "So far the DAEs were trained on single-object images, then used to bind objects in multi-object images. In general it is desirable to not require single-object images for training, and be able to directly use any image without this restriction. This would remove the last bit of supervision and make RC a truly unsupervised method.\nWhy should this work at all? On the surface it seems that RC would depend on the DAE to prefer single objects in order to work correctly. However, even if each cluster tries to reconstruct every object, there will be small asymmetries due to the difference in inputs they see. Since no object carries any information about the shape and position of another object in our datasets, this will lead to differences in prediction quality of the objects. The resulting difference in reconstruction quality will then be amplified by RC and can still lead to a segregation of the objects.\nTo test this scenario, we performed a new random search to tune DAE hyperparameters for the case of multi-object training. Similar to the single-object case, we then used the best obtained DAEs to perform RC on test examples. We found that with soft-assignments to the clusters, the differences were too small and would even out over several iterations, leading to uniform cluster assignments. By changing the E-step to hard (K-Means-like) assignments, we were able to amplify these changes enough to make the whole procedure work. Figure 6b shows that DAEs trained on multi-object images can indeed be used for binding via RC with hard assignments, although they lead to lower scores in comparison. Further discussion and examples for this case can be found in Appendix C."}, {"heading": "4.6 GENERALIZATION TO A NEW DOMAIN", "text": "A central intuition behind our approach to binding is that the low-level structures learned by the model will generalize to new and unseen configurations. Evaluation on unseen test sets demonstrated\nthis to be true, but we can take it one step further. We can test what happens when we confront our method with novel objects that the auto-encoders have not been trained on.\nWe ran RC on several images with non-digits using a DAE trained on the Multi-MNIST dataset. Figure 7 shows that RC \u201ccorrectly\u201d binds letters and circles together. We also show images for which the resulting binding differs from our expectation. It appears that the network has mainly learned to bind based on spatial proximity with a slight bias towards vertical proximity. This can be expected since that it has only seen digits of roughly the same size so far, and because the used autoencoder is very limited. Nevertheless, it is very interesting that a fully-connected network which is permutation invariant learns the preference for spatial proximity entirely from data. It is reasonable to speculate that it in the future it may be possible to recover other Gestalt Principles such as continuity and similarity with a similar procedure."}, {"heading": "5 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER METHODS", "text": "The binding problem and its possible solutions are a long standing debate in the neuroscience literature (see e.g. Milner (1974); von der Malsburg (1981); Gray (1999); Treisman (1999); Di Lollo (2012)). A major thread of work on binding has been inspired by the temporal correlation theory (von der Malsburg, 1981), based on utilizing synchronous oscillations to bind neuronal activities together. von der Malsburg (1995) provides an overview of these ideas. Recently, these ideas were implemented using complex valued activations in neural networks to jointly encode firing rate and phase (Rao et al., 2008; Reichert & Serre, 2013). Such binding mechanisms are close to their biological inspiration, clustering only implicitly through synchronization. In contrast, RC is based on a mathematical framework which explicitly incorporates binding.\nMechanisms for tackling the binding problem which do not require temporal synchronization have also been proposed (e.g. O\u2019Reilly et al., 2003). O\u2019reilly & Busby (2002) argued that the intuitive explanation of the binding problem from Figure 1b only applies if the distributed features themselves are local codes. They suggested that neural networks can avoid the binding problem using coarse-coded representations. Various feature representation types including coarse-coding and their limitations were described by Hinton (1984).\nIn principle, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs; e.g. Robinson & Fallside, 1987; Werbos, 1988) can solve the binding problem by learning a mechanism to avoid it. Psychologists (Di Lollo, 2012) and machine learning researchers (Weng et al., 2006) alike have suggested feedback as a mechanism to do binding. An RNN may utilize an implicit or explicit attention mechanism to selectively process different parts of the input (Schmidhuber & Huber, 1991; Mnih et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014). In this context, explicit binding via RC can be seen as a technique of paying attention to multiple objects at once, instead of focusing on them sequentially.\nIn some aspects, RC is similar to segmentation algorithms. The main difference is that RC learns the segmentation from the data in a largely unsupervised manner. In this sense, it is more similar to superpixel methods (see e.g. Achanta et al. (2012) for an overview). However, these methods impose a handcrafted similarity measure over pixels or pixel regions, whereas RC learns a non-linear similarity measure from the data, parameterized by a DAE."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "We introduced the Reconstruction Clustering framework to explicitly model data as a composition of objects, where the notion of object-ness is defined by mutual predictability. Compared to many previous solutions to the binding problem, this framework is mathematically rigorous, integrates well with current representation learning methods, and is effective for a variety of binary image datasets.\nWhile a typical representation learning method (such as a denoising autoencoder) learns a static binding of features, Reconstruction Clustering utilizes it to iteratively perform dynamic binding for every input example by introducing interaction between the statically bound features extracted by the autoencoder. In particular, this interaction enables dynamic binding of feature combinations never seen before by the autoencoder.\nThis paper lays the groundwork for many concrete lines of future exploration. The treatment of real-valued inputs is an important next step to extension RC towards natural data. Also the use of more powerful autoencoders will be key. Integrating RC with the training of the DAE should help to deal with multiple objects in the training data. Since the method is general, we expect to apply it to other domains such as audio data (binding different speaker voices together) or medical data (binding various related symptoms of disease together). A particularly interesting direction for future work is to show that Gestalt principles are a natural result of such a representation learning approach."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "We thank Jan Koutn\u0131\u0301k, Sjoerd van Steenkiste, Boyan Beronov and Julian Zilly for helpful discussions and comments.

The product over the entries of z then vanishes except for the term corrsponding to the k-th entry. 1This assumption means that we assume the hidden representation of the DAE to capture the structure in the image well.\nUsing the same conditional independence assumption from before we can thus write the data distribution given all the latent variables as follows:\nP (x|Z,\u00b5,\u03c0) = N\u220f i=1 P (xi|zi,\u00b5i,\u03c0) (16)\nAnd by using Bayes rule and assuming that Z is independent of \u00b5:\nP (x,Z|\u00b5,\u03c0) = P (x|Z,\u00b5,\u03c0)P (Z|\u03c0) (17)\n= N\u220f i=1 K\u220f k=1 (\u00b5xiik(1\u2212 \u00b5ik) 1\u2212xi\u03c0k) zik (18)\nIf we set \u03b8 = {\u00b5,\u03c0}2 the complete-data log likelihood becomes:\nL(\u03b8|x,Z) = logP (x,Z|\u00b5,\u03c0) (19)\n= N\u2211 i=1 K\u2211 k=1 zik [xi log\u00b5ik + (1\u2212 xi) log(1\u2212 \u00b5ik) + log \u03c0k] (20)\nTo maximize L with respect to \u03b8 and Z we follow the same idea as the EM algorithm: Based on the observation that if we knew the values of either of these two, optimizing the other would be feasible. So we divide the optimization problem into two steps where we pretend to know either \u03b8 (E-step) or Z (M-step).\nIn the E-Step we assume to know \u03b8 and calculate the posterior probability of zik = 1 for each datapoint calling it \u03b3ik: (We assume the zik to be independent of xj for i 6= j)\n\u03b3ik = P (zik = 1|xi,\u00b5i,\u03c0) = P (xi|zik = 1,\u00b5i)P (zik = 1|\u03c0)\nP (xi|\u00b5i,\u03c0) (21)\n= \u00b5xiik(1\u2212 \u00b5ik) 1\u2212xi\u03c0k K\u2211 j=1 \u00b5xiij (1\u2212 \u00b5ij) 1\u2212xi\u03c0j\n(22)\nNext we calculate the Q value used in EM which is defined as the expectation of the complete data log-likelihood L with respect to the posterior of Z given the data and the old parameters \u03b8old:\nQ(\u03b8,\u03b8old) = EZ[logP (x,Z|\u03b8)|x,\u03b8old] (23) = \u2211 Z P (Z|x,\u03b8old) logP (x,Z|\u03b8) (24)\n= N\u2211 i=1 K\u2211 k=1 \u03b3ik [xi log\u00b5ik + (1\u2212 xi) log(1\u2212 \u00b5ik) + log \u03c0k] (25)\nIn the M-step of EM we aim to maximize Q(\u03b8,\u03b8old) over all choices of \u03b8:\n\u03b8new = argmax \u03b8 Q(\u03b8,\u03b8old) (26)\n2Here we deviate slightly from the notation in the paper.\nUsing a Lagrange multiplier to enforce \u2211K\nk=1 \u03c0k = 1 we find:\n\u03c0newk = \u2211N i=1 \u03b3ik N\n(27)\nBut when maximizing wrt. \u00b5 we see that the maximum is trivially obtained by setting \u00b5ik = xi for all k. This is due to the fact that the problem is actually ill-posed in the sense that we have K parameters to fit for each datapoint. So there are infinitely many solutions which achieve the optimal log likelihood of the data of 0.\nAt this point we introduce an autoencoder with encoder f and decoder g to restrict the capacity of our model by forcing \u00b5 to be:\n\u00b5\u00b7k = g(f(\u03b3k x)) (28)\nWe use this reconstruction step (Equation 28) instead of an actual maximization step, thus deviating from the EM formulation."}, {"heading": "B TRAINING DETAILS", "text": "All experiments have been performed with the brainstorm library and were organized and logged using sacred.

To find good values we performed a random search with 100 runs for each dataset. For each run we randomly sampled from the following parameters:\n\u2022 learning rate log-uniform from [10\u22123, 1] \u2022 Amount of Salt& Pepper Noise from [0.0, 0.1, . . . , 0.9] \u2022 hidden layer size from [100, 250, 500, 1000] \u2022 hidden layer activation function from [rel, sigmoid, tanh]\nThe best network configurations found by that search can be found in Table 1.\nB.3 RANDOM SEARCH FOR TRAINING WITH MULTIPLE OBJECTS\nFor training with multiple objects we do an equivalent random search for hyperparameters. The only difference is the training data and that for determining the final score we use K-means-like (hard) cluster assignments in RC. Note also that we didn\u2019t include the Simple Superposition dataset, since we only have 120 images with multiple objects available, and no separate test set."}, {"heading": "C MULTI OBJECT TRAINING", "text": "When training the DAEs on images with multiple objects, it is less obvious why running RC should lead to a segregation of the objects. It seems that the autoencoder should always try to reconstruct the whole image including all the objects. And if we run normal (soft) RC we in fact see that after a few iterations each pixel is equally represented by each cluster.\nBy switching to hard cluster assignments we eliminate this stable state, and force the clusters to compete more for the pixels. Together with the fact that in our datasets objects don\u2019t carry any information about other objects this leads to a stronger amplification of the initial differences in reconstruction quality. In Figure 10 this process can be seen on the shapes dataset. Note that the hard RC converges even faster, but generally leads to worse performance.\nD ADDITIONAL FIGURES\n0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\nTest\u00a0Samples\u00a0Sorted\u00a0by\u00a0Score\nscore confidence\nIn pu\nt\u00a0I m\nag e\nA B C D E F\nC lu\nst er\n\u00a0A ss\nig nm\nen ts\nG ro\nun d\nT ru\nth\n1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0\nlog\u00a0Likelihood\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\nIteration\u00a0nr\nA B C D E F\n600 500 400 300 200 100\n0 Z oom ed\nFigure 11\n0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\nIn pu\nt\u00a0I m\nag e\nC lu\nst er\n\u00a0A ss\nig nm\nen ts\nG ro\nun d\nT ru\nth\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\nIn pu\nt\u00a0I m\nag e\nC lu\nst er\n\u00a0A ss\nig nm\nen ts\nG ro\nun d\nT ru\nth"}], "references": [{"title": "SLIC superpixels compared to state-of-the-art superpixel methods", "author": ["Achanta", "Radhakrishna", "Shaji", "Appu", "Smith", "Kevin", "Lucchi", "Aurelien", "Fua", "Pascal", "Susstrunk", "Sabine"], "venue": "Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on,", "citeRegEx": "Achanta et al\\.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Achanta et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate", "author": ["Bahdanau", "Dzmitry", "Cho", "Kyunghyun", "Bengio", "Yoshua"], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.0473,", "citeRegEx": "Bahdanau et al\\.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bahdanau et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Finding minimum entropy codes", "author": ["Barlow", "Horace B", "Kaushal", "Tej P", "Mitchison", "Graeme J"], "venue": "Neural Computation,", "citeRegEx": "Barlow et al\\.,? \\Q1989\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Barlow et al\\.", "year": 1989}, {"title": "Learning iterative image reconstruction in the Neural Abstraction Pyramid", "author": ["Behnke", "Sven"], "venue": "International Journal of Computational Intelligence and Applications,", "citeRegEx": "Behnke and Sven.,? \\Q2001\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Behnke and Sven.", "year": 2001}, {"title": "Scaling learning algorithms towards AI", "author": ["Bengio", "Yoshua", "LeCun", "Yann", "others"], "venue": "Large-scale kernel machines,", "citeRegEx": "Bengio et al\\.,? \\Q2007\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bengio et al\\.", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Representation learning: A review and new perspectives", "author": ["Bengio", "Yoshua", "Courville", "Aaron", "Vincent", "Pierre"], "venue": "Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on,", "citeRegEx": "Bengio et al\\.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bengio et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Generalized denoising auto-encoders as generative models", "author": ["Bengio", "Yoshua", "Yao", "Li", "Alain", "Guillaume", "Vincent", "Pascal"], "venue": "In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,", "citeRegEx": "Bengio et al\\.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bengio et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Maximum likelihood from incomplete data via the EM algorithm.

However, for complex data, the distributed representations of multiple objects present in the same input can interfere and lead to ambiguities, which is commonly referred to as the binding problem. We argue for the importance of the binding problem to the field of representation learning, and develop a probabilistic framework that explicitly models inputs as a composition of multiple objects. We propose an algorithm that uses a denoising autoencoder to dynamically bind features together in multi-object inputs through an Expectation-Maximization-like clustering process. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated on artificially generated datasets of binary images, showing that it can even generalize to bind together new objects never seen by the autoencoder during training.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
