Initially proposed by Smolensky [1986] for modeling cognitive process, it grew to prominence after successful application were found by Geoffrey Hinton and his collaborators [Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006, 2012; Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2009]. As a building block for deep belief network (DBN) and deep Boltzmann machines (DBM), RBM is extremely useful for pre-training the data by projecting them to a hidden layer. Also, it is proved that by adding another layer on top of a RBM, the variational lower bound of the data likelihood can be increased [Hinton et al., 2006; Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2012], which conveys the theoretical advantage of building multilayer RBMs.\nPre-training of the data by using a RBM is essentially a unsupervised learning process, in which no label of the data is provided. Instead, the training process is trying to maximize the data likelihood by finding a proper set of parameters of the RBM.\nHowever less attention has been given to the analysis of Rademacher complexity on RBMs. Rademacher complexity in the computational learning theory, measures richness of a class of realvalued functions with respect to a probability distribution. It can be regarded as a generalization of PAC-Bayes analysis. Its particular setting can help analysis of unsupervised learning algorithms,\n1\nrather than merely the prediction problems, given the hypothesis class is possibly infinite. Honorio [2012] also proved that discrete factor graphs, including Markov random fields, are Lipschitz continuous, which motivated this work to further investigate the properties of RBM.\nThe goal of this paper is trying to bound the Rademacher complexity for the likelihood of the RBM algorithm from a given training data set, with pre-assumptions that the model structure of the RBM is known (data dimensionality and number of hidden nodes)."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In the beginning of this section we introduce Lipschitz continuity.\nDefinition 1.

The restricted Boltzmann machine is a two layer Markov Random Field, where the observed binary stochastic visible units x \u2208 {0, 1}k have pairwise connections to the binary stochastic hidden units h \u2208 {0, 1}m. There are no pairwise connections within the visible units, nor within the hidden ones. Restricted Boltzmann machine is a energy-based model, in which we define the energy for a state {x,h} as\nEnergy(x,h;\u03b8) = \u2212xTb\u2212 hTc\u2212 xTWh, (4)\nPage 2 of 11\nwhere \u03b8 = {c,b,W}, c \u2208 Rm,b \u2208 Rk, and W \u2208 Rk\u00d7m.

The sum over h and x enumerate all the possible values for the visible units and the hidden ones. Our goal optimization is to maximize the log-likelihood (minimize the negative log-likelihood) of the model.

As we stated, we only consider equation 11 that has randomness and ignore the partition part of the log-likelihood. Using the notation in Lemma 2, we can write\nR\u0302s(ln p\u03b8) = R\u0302s(\nm\u2211\nj=1\nHj) \u2264 m\u2211\nj=1\nR\u0302s(Hj), (42)\nwhich is from the elementary properties of the Rademacher complexity. Knowing the fact that each Hj is of the same hypothesis space further provides us with m\u2211\nj=1\nR\u0302s(Hj) = mR\u0302s(H). (43)\nFrom Lemma 2 we have R\u0302s(H) \u2264 R\u0302s(F) + R\u0302s(G). And from Lemma 1 we can directly bound R\u0302s(F) by B \u221a 2 ln (k)\nn .

In order to approximate the partition function for all possible visible examples, a MCMC chain is created. First an example is sampled uniformly from the empirical training examples. Then a mean-field approximation is applied to obtain the values of hidden units (whose values are also binary): Rather than sample from the distribution of h, we use the values \u2200 i, P (hi = 1) as the values to approximate the samples. After we obtain h\u0303, we have the distribution of x based on the current values of h (mean-field approximation) and parameters (W,b, c). We sample from this distribution to obtain a vector x\u0303 and use it to approximate the partition function. This procedure can also extended to more steps (CD-k, k steps). But experiments have shown that, even one step (CD-1) can yield a good performance for the model [Bengio, 2009].\nAfter using CD-1 algorithm, the Rademacher complexity of the second part of equation 7 is no more free of randomness, due to the fact that x\u0303 is a function of x. If we rewrite the second part as\nZ\u03b8 \u2248 \u2211\nh\nexp{\u2212Energy(x\u0303,h;\u03b8)}, (44)\nRademacher complexity of this term is also depending on random variable x.\nTo simplify the procedure but without losing generality, instead of sampling x\u0303 from its distribution, we also use mean field approximation to obtain x\u0303. Also, we can write the energy function as\nEnergy(x,h;\u03b8) = xTWh, (45)\nwhile ignore the bias term for simplicity.\nRemark 3. Using mean filed approximation, we can obtain\nh\u0303T = (sgm(xTW\u00b71), . . . , sgm(x TW\u00b7m)), (46)\nwhere sgm() is the sigmoid function, and W\u00b7j is the j-th column of W.\nProof.

Given a restricted Boltzmann machine with k visible units and m hidden ones, and it is trained by using\nPage 9 of 11\nCD-1 algorithm. For all the parameters \u03b8 = {W}, and W \u2208 Rk\u00d7m, assuming W is bounded by spheres \u2016W\u2016max = \u2200j \u2016W\u00b7j\u20161 \u2264 W, where W\u00b7j is the j-th column of W. Let T be a compositional function of x with parameters W, i.e.,\nT = {Wijsgm ( m\u2211\nv=1\nWivsgm(x TW\u00b7v)\n)\n|W \u2208 Rk\u00d7m \u2200j \u2208 {1, . . . ,m}. (64)\nWe further assume the VC-dimension of T is V C(T ). We can bound the empirical Rademacher complexity for the likelihood of this restricted Boltzmann machine as:\nR\u0302s(ln p\u03b8) \u2264 W\u221a n\n( m \u221a 2 ln k + k \u221a 2V C(T ) ln(n+ 1) ) . (65)\nProof. Using the result of Remark 1, we can bound R\u0302s(logZ\u03b8) in equation 44 by R\u0302s(logZ\u03b8) \u2264 R\u0302s( k\u2211\ni=1 Ti). Similar to equation 42, R\u0302s(\nk\u2211 i=1 Ti) \u2264 k\u2211 i=1 R\u0302s(Ti). Knowing the fact that each Ti is from\nthe same hypothesis space further provides us with\nk\u2211\ni=1\nR\u0302s(Ti) = kR\u0302s(T ). (66)\nUsing the results in Lemma 4 we obtain R\u0302s(logZ\u03b8) \u2264 Wk\n\u221a\n2n ln |T | n . Then by Sauer-Shelah\nlemma, we know\nmax S\n|T (S)| \u2264 (n+ 1)V C(T ). (67)\nTherefore we obtain\nR\u0302s(logZ\u03b8) \u2264 Wk\n\u221a\n2n ln |T | n\n\u2264 Wk \u221a\n2V C(T )n ln(n+ 1) n\n(68)\nTogether with the results from Theorem 1, while ignoring the bias term, we proved this corollary."}, {"heading": "5 Future Direction", "text": "Can we get a tighter bound on it?
