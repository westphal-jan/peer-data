INTRODUCTION\nIn the present author\u2019s perspective of the contamination problem and axiomatic granular approach [1], it is required that reasonable measures should carry information about the underlying rough evolution. A contaminated operation is simply an operation (used in the particular rough semantics in question) without reasonable semantic justification in the domain under consideration. Such operations can be particularly problematic when the semantics is intended for modeling vague reasoning. Some approaches using new dialectic counting strategies are developed and related semantic structures have been developed in the same paper. It is not easy to apply it in practice in its presented form in [1]. So another approach that reduces measurability to relative comparability with preservation of rough evolution has been proposed and developed in [3]. Thus for example, the intended use of measures of rough inclusion may be reduced to comparison of related formulas. In this research paper, we extend the approach to deal with possibly contaminated operations and algebraically deal with bigness/relevance.\nFor simplicity, we will work with special kinds of RYS that are partially ordered partial algebras. Let X = \u3008X,P, (l\u2217i ) n 1 , (u \u2217 i ) n 1 ,\u2295,\u2299, 1\u3009 and Y,= \u3008Y,P2, (li)n1 , (ui) n 1 ,\u22952,\u22992, `\u3009 be two general rough Y-systems (RYS) with associated granulations G and G2 respectively. The interpretation of X and Y will be that of some collections of objects of interest and not necessarily of rough objects. Granules need not be rough objects in general\nand this aspect affects the way we express the semantics. Any map \u03d5 : X 7\u2212\u2192 Y will be taken to be a correspondence between the systems, though of course only those that preserve granularity or approximations in some sense would be of interest. It is also possible to adapt other particular approximation frameworks such as the abstract approximation space framework of [4] for the purposes of the present paper in a formal mathematical setting.\nA. Background\nAn adaptation of the precision-based classical granular computing paradigm to rough sets is explained in [5], [6]. The axiomatic approach to granularity initiated in [7] has been developed by the present author in the direction of contamination reduction in [1]. From the order-theoretic/algebraic point of view, the deviation is in a very new direction relative the precision-based paradigm. The paradigm shift includes a new approach to measures and this is taken up in a new direction in this research paper.\nWe expect the reader to be aware of the different measures used in RST like those of degree of rough inclusion, rough membership (see [8] and references therein), \u03b1-cover and consistency degrees of knowledges. If these are not representable in terms of granules through term operations formed from the basic ones [7], then they are not truly functions/degrees of the rough domain. In [1], such measures are said to be noncompliant for the rough context in question and new granular measures have been proposed as replacement of the same.\nKnowledge of partial algebras (see [9]), weak equalities and closed morphisms will be assumed. In a partial algebra, for term functions p, q, the weak equality is defined via, p \u03c9 = q iff (\u2200x \u2208 dom(p) \u2229 dom(q))p(x) = q(x). The weakstrong equality is defined via, dom(p) = dom(q),&p \u03c9\u2217 = q iff (\u2200x \u2208 dom(p))p(x) = q(x). By a \u2295 -morphism f between two algebras X and Y with interpretations for the operation symbol \u2295, we will mean a map that preserves the interpretation of \u2295, that is (\u2200x, y \u2208 X)f(x\u2295y) = f(x)\u2295 f(y). In other words it is a forgetful morphism that preserves the interpretation of the operation \u2295.\nWe use the simplified approach to RYS of [2] (instead of the version in [1]) that avoids the operator \u03b9 and is focused on a\ngeneral set-theoretic perspective. These structures are provided with enough structure so that a Meta-C and at least one Meta-R of roughly equivalent objects along with admissible operations and predicates are associable. For the language, axioms and notation see [2]. Our models will assume total operations as in [2]. Admissible granulations [1] will be those granulations satisfying the conditions WRA, LFU, LS."}, {"heading": "II. SNC AND VARIATIONS", "text": "In this section we update some of the material of [2] with complete proofs and introduce important modifications of the concept of a SNC. A map from a RYS S1 to another S2 will be referred to as a correspondence. It will be called a morphism if and only if it preserves the operations \u2295 and \u2299. We will also speak of \u2295-morphisms and \u2299 -morphisms if the correspondence preserves just one of the partial/total operations. By Sub-Natural Correspondences (SNC), we seek to capture simpler correspondences that associate granules with elements representable by granules and do not necessarily commit the context to Galois connections. An issue with SNCs is that it fails to adequately capture granule centric correspondences that may violate the injectivity constraint and may not play well with morphisms.\nDefinition 1. Let If S1 and S2 are two RYS with granulations, G1 and G2 respectively, consisting of successor neighborhoods or neighborhoods. A correspondence \u03d5 : S1 7\u2212\u2192 S2 will be said to be a Proto Natural Correspondence (PON) (respectively Pre-Natural Correspondence (PNC)) iff the second (respectively both) of the following conditions hold:\n1) \u03d5|G1 is injective : G1 7\u2212\u2192 G2. 2) there is a term function t in the signature of S2 such that\n(\u2200[x] \u2208 G1)(\u2203y1, . . . yn \u2208 G2)\u03d5([x]) = t(y1, . . . , yn). 3) the yis in the second condition are generated by \u03d5({x})\nfor each i ({x} being a singleton).\nAn injective correspondence \u03d5 : S1 7\u2212\u2192 S2 will be said to be a SNC iff the last two conditions hold.\nNote that the base sets of RYS may be semi-algebras of sets.\nTheorem 1. If \u03d5 is a SNC and both G1 and G2 are partitions, then the non-trivial cases should be equivalent to one of the following:\n\u2022 B1: (\u2200{x} \u2208 S1)\u03d5([x]) = [\u03d5({x})]. B2: (\u2200{x} \u2208 S1)\u03d5([x]) =\u223c [\u03d5({x})]. \u2022 B3: (\u2200{x} \u2208 S1)\u03d5([x]) = \u22c3\ny\u2208[x][\u03d5({y})]. B4: (\u2200{x} \u2208 S1)\u03d5([x]) =\u223c ( \u22c3 y\u2208[x][\u03d5({y})]).\nProof: Intersection of two distinct classes is always empty. If \u223c is defined, then the second and fourth case will be possible. So these four exhaust all possibilities.\nTheorem 2. If \u03d5 is a SNC, G1 is a partition and G2 is a system of blocks, then the non-trivial cases should be equivalent to one of the following (\u223c (\u03b2(x)) is the set {\u223c B : B \u2208 \u03b2(x)} and {x} \u2208 S1 ):\nC1: \u03d5([x]) = \u222a\u03b2(\u03d5({x})).\nC2: \u03d5([x]) =\u223c (\u222a\u03b2(\u03d5({x}))). C3: \u03d5([x]) = \u2229\u03b2(\u03d5({x})). C4: \u03d5([x]) =\u223c (\u2229\u03b2(\u03d5({x}))). C5: \u03d5([x]) = \u22c3\ny\u2208[x]\u222a\u03b2(\u03d5({x})). C6: \u03d5([x]) =\u223c ( \u22c3\ny\u2208[x]\u222a\u03b2(\u03d5({x}))). C7: \u03d5([x]) = \u22c2\ny\u2208[x]\u222a\u03b2(\u03d5({x})). C8: \u03d5([x]) =\u223c ( \u22c3\ny\u2208[x]\u2229\u03b2(\u03d5({x}))).\nTheorem 3. If we take S1 to be a classical RST-RYS and S2 is a TAS-RYS with approximations lB\u2217 and uB\u2217 and \u03d5 is a SNC and a \u2295-morphism satisfying the first condition above, then all of the following hold:\n1) \u03d5(xl) \u2286 (\u03d5(x))lB \u2217\n, 2) \u03d5(xu) \u2286 (\u03d5(x))uB \u2217\n, 3) If \u03d5 is a morphism, that preserves \u2205 and 1, then equality\nholds in the above two statements.\nBut the converse need not hold in general.\nProof:\n1) If A \u2208 S1, then \u03d5(Al) = \u03d5( \u22c3\n[{x}]\u2286A[{x}]) = \u22c3\n[{x}]\u2286A\u03d5([{x}]) = \u22c3\n[{x}]\u2286A \u2229\u03b2({\u03d5({x})}), and that is a subset of \u22c3\n\u03d5([{x}])\u2286\u03d5(A)\u2229\u03b2({\u03d5({x})}). Some of the B\u2217 elements included in \u03d5(A) may be lost if we start from \u03d5(Al).\n2) If A \u2208 S1, then \u03d5(Au) = \u03d5( \u22c3\n[{x}]\u2229A6=\u2205[{x}]) = \u22c3\n[{x}]\u2229A6=\u2205\u03d5([{x}]) = \u22c3\n[{x}]\u2229A6=\u2205 \u2229\u03b2({\u03d5({x})}), and that is a subset of \u22c3\ny\u2229\u03d5(A)6=\u2205\u2229\u03b2(y). In the last part possible values of y include all of the values in \u03d5(A). 3) Because of the conditions on \u03d5, for any A,B \u2208 S1 if A\u2229B = \u2205, then \u03d5(A)\u2229\u03d5(B) = \u2205. So a definite element must be mapped into a union of disjoint granules in S2. Further, for A \u2208 S1 and \u03be, \u03b7, \u03b6 being abbreviations for (\u2229\u03b2(\u03d5(x)))\u2229\u03d5(A) 6= \u2205, \u03d5([{x}]\u2229A) 6= \u2205 and \u03d5([{x}])\u2229 \u03d5(A) 6= \u2205 respectively, (\u03d5(A))uB \u2217 = \u22c3\n\u03be \u2229\u03b2(\u03d5(x)) = \u03d5( \u22c3\n\u03be[{x}]) = \u03d5( \u22c3 \u03b6[{x}]) = \u03d5( \u22c3\n\u03b7[{x}]), which is \u03d5(Au)).\nTheorem 4. If we take S1 to be a classical RST-RYS and S2 as a TAS-RYS with approximations lT and uT and \u03d5 is a SNC and a \u2295 - morphism satisfying for each singleton {x} \u2208 S1, \u03d5([{x}]) = [\u03d5(x)], then all of the following hold:\n1) \u03d5(xl) \u2286 (\u03d5(x))lT , 2) \u03d5(xu) \u2286 (\u03d5(x))uT ."}, {"heading": "III. COMPARABLE CORRESPONDENCES", "text": "Growth functions are well known in summability, numerical analysis and computer science, but are generally presented in a simplistic way in most of the literature. In [3], these are presented in a more mature form and related to rough sets over the reals. Key higher order similarities exist between such concepts of comparable over sufficiently large domains in the theory and the idea of comparability in this paper.\nThe main steps of the comparison approach in this research paper consist in specifying the semantic domains of interest, formulation the two or more granular semantics as a RYS\n(a formal language is not absolutely essential), specification of the granular rough evolutions of interest, identification of the granular correspondences of interest, computation of the comparative status of the granular correspondences and finally augmentation of the best correspondences with reasonable measures if sensible.\nLet X, Y be two general rough Y-systems (RYS) with associated granulations G and G2 respectively as in the introduction. The interpretation of X and Y will be that of some collections of objects of interest and not necessarily of rough objects. Granules need not be rough objects in general and this aspect affects the way we express the semantics. Here by rough evolution we mean the granular properties expressed by the sentences satisfied in the models.\nDefinition 2. The atoms and coatoms of X will be denoted by A(X) and CA(X) respectively. X\\(A(X)\u222a{0, 1}), X\\(CA(X)\u222a {0, 1}) and X \\ (A(X) \u222a CA(X) \u222a {0, 1}) respectively will be denoted by Xa, Xc and Xac respectively. In all this, if the least element 0 is not present in X then the operation of subtracting it from X will not have any effect. The key objects in this perspective may be objects relevant for the rough evolution that may fail to be things like Xac, Xa or Xc. These will be subsets of X, denoted by Xr.\nDefinition 3. Let h, f be correspondences : X 7\u2212\u2192 Y, then f will be \u0398lu-related to h iff for some i, (\u2203z0 \u2208 Xc)(\u2200z \u2208 {x;P2z0x})P2(h(z))lif(z)&P2f(z)(h(z))ui . In contrast f will be \u0398uu-related to h iff for some i, j,\n(\u2203z0 \u2208 Xc)(\u2200z \u2208 {x;P2z0x})P2(h(z))uif(z)&P2f(z)(h(z))uj\nWe will also denote the set of elements \u0398lu and \u0398uu -related to h respectively by \u0398lu(h) and \u0398uu(h) respectively.\nDefinition 4. Let h, f be correspondences : X 7\u2212\u2192 Y, then f will be \u2126l-related to h iff for some i, (\u2203z0 \u2208 Xc)(\u2200z \u2208 {x;P2z0x})P2(h(z))lif(z). In contrast f will be \u2126u-related to h iff for some i,\n(\u2203z0 \u2208 Xc)(\u2200z \u2208 {x;P2z0x})P2(h(z))uif(z).\nWe will also write, \u2126l(h) and \u2126u(h) respectively for the set of elements \u2126lu and \u2126uu related to h respectively.\nDefinition 5. Let h, f be correspondences : X 7\u2212\u2192 Y, then f will be Ou-related to h iff for some i,\n(\u2203z0 \u2208 Xc)(\u2200z \u2208 {x;P2z0x})P2f(z)(h(z))ui .\nIn contrast f will be Ol-related to h iff for some i,\n(\u2203z0 \u2208 Xc)(\u2200z \u2208 {x;P2z0x})P2f(z)(h(z))li .\nWe will also write, Ol(h) and Ou(h) respectively for the sets of elements Ol and Ou -related to h.\nProposition 1. If f \u2208 \u0398lu(h), then it is not necessary that h \u2208 \u0398lu(f). The result holds even when f, h are morphisms.\nExamples for this can be constructed for classical rough set theory itself. This motivates the following definition.\nDefinition 6. f will be symmetrically \u0398lu-related to h iff f \u2208 \u0398lu(h) and h \u2208 \u0398lu(f). Further we will denote \u0398lu(h) \u2229Mor(X, Y) by \u00b5\u0398lu(h) when h \u2208 Mor(X, Y) and \u0398lu(h) \u2229Morc(X, Y) by \u00b5c\u0398lu(h) when h \u2208 Morc(X, Y). Morc(X, Y) being the set of closed morphisms. Analogously all other notions defined above can be extended.\nThe basic idea of the above definitions is that for some subcollections of objects, f and h transform objects in a similar way. To really make this useful, we need to impose structural constraints on the map (like preservation of rough evolution). Without those, the following properties will hold:\nProposition 2. For f, g \u2208 \u00b5\u0398lu(h), the following operations are well defined on \u00b5\u0398lu(h) and \u00b5c\u0398lu(h):\n1)\n(\u2200x \u2208 X)(f + g)(x) =\n{ f(x)\u22952 g(x) if defined,\nundefined otherwise.\n2)\n(\u2200x \u2208 X)(f \u00b7 g)(x) =\n{ f(x)\u22992 g(x) if defined,\nundefined otherwise.\n3) (\u2200x \u2208 X)\u0131(x) = `\nProof: Since \u2200a, b \u2208 Y, a \u22952 b is defined or undefined and similarly for a \u22992 b, the operations are well defined morphisms. In case Y is a total algebraic system, all we need to do is to verify the morphism conditions (when X is a partial/total algebraic system).\nDefinition 7. Further, we can define parthood relations \u2264 and \u2264c respectively on \u00b5\u0398lu(h) and \u00b5c\u0398lu(h) respectively as below: f \u2264 g iff (\u2200x \u2208 X)P2f(x)g(x).\nProposition 3. The parthood relations \u2264 and \u2264c are quasiorders. \u2264 induces a partial order on the quotient \u00b5\u0398lu(h)| \u2248 (and \u00b5c\u0398lu(h)| \u2248c respectively) defined by\nf \u2248 g iff f \u2264 g&g \u2264 f.\nA. Relevant Types of Subsets\nIn the above considerations, the concept of comparison assumes that two correspondences are comparable provided they are comparable over specific types of sets. Further the idea of specific type of sets is restricted to ones definable by excluding atoms and co-atoms. This is not necessarily the best thing to do. The concepts of partial reducts, \u03b1covers and related ones use number based exclusion criteria along with the difficulties associated with them. We propose theoretical improvements at the granulation level only and without algorithms (for now) for improving the situation.\nA relevant set can be one that has a sufficiently large subset. This means that in most algebraic approaches to semantics of rough objects, we can associate nice structures with them. We show this for the classical RST contexts later in this paper. In all cases, we can almost certainly improve the semantics through possibly definable predicates for relevance.\nLet Bx denote the statement \u2019x is big/relevant\u2019 and xo be a relevant object then possible axioms for relevance/bigness may be formed from combination of axioms from below or from similar ones :\n\u2022 \u22061: Bx iff (y)(Pxoy \u2212\u2192 Pyxl). \u2022 \u22062: Pxox&Pxlox\nl. \u2022 \u22063: Pxoxl&xo \u2208 \u03b4l(S). \u2022 \u22064: Pxoxl&xo \u2208 \u03b4lu(S). \u2022 \u22065: Pxoxl&xo \u2208 \u03b4u(S).\nIn many practical situations, relevance can be defined by feature sets and xo may also be an abstract object corresponding to a Boolean combination of features.\nGiven such a B predicate, we can define a concept of \u2019f being of the B-order of rough growth of g (in symbols \u0393fg)\u2019 by\n(\u2200y)(\u2200x)(Pxyl&Bx \u2212\u2192 P(fy)l(gy)&P(gy)(fy)u).\nThis is one of the possible generalizations of the concepts introduced earlier for classification. An abstract view of possible B axioms is in order for the following sections:\n\u2022 B1: (\u2200x, a)(Ba,&Pax \u2212\u2192 Bx). \u2022 B2: (\u2200x)(Bx \u2212\u2192 Bxu). \u2022 B3: (\u2200x, a, b)(Bx&Pxa&Pab \u2212\u2192 Bb). \u2022 BC1: (\u2200a, b)(Ba&Bb \u2212\u2192 Ba\u2295 b). \u2022 BC2: (\u2200a, b)(Ba&Ba \u2295 b \u2212\u2192 Bb). \u2022 BC3: (\u2200a, b)(Ba \u2212\u2192 Ba \u2295 a). \u2022 BC4: (\u2200a, b)(Ba&Bb \u2212\u2192 Ba\u2299 b). \u2022 BC5: (\u2200a, b)(Ba \u2295 a \u2212\u2192 Ba). \u2022 BC6: (\u2200a, b, c)(Bb&Pab&Pbc \u2212\u2192 Bb\u2299 c)\nProposition 4. In a RYS, all of the following hold:\n\u2022 If B1 holds then B2 follows. \u2022 B1 follows from B3, but the converse need not hold.\nExample\nConcepts of \u2019big/relevant-enough for a particular action\u2019 to be performed are fairly routine in system administration contexts. Suppose the policy is to provide additional privileges for users with specific kinds of usage patterns of resources on the Internet and possibly local repositories or cache. This policy can be implemented as a rough set computation based rule system: each user on the local network (or ISP\u2019s network) can be associated with dynamically constructed approximations of their usage. These approximations may be mapped for comparison with an abstract rough set based usage system and then the policies may be implemented. Much of the computation in this regard can be highly nontrivial, but complexity is likely to reach a plateau with increase in number of users in the system."}, {"heading": "IV.

In a large subclass of RSTs some consequences of these hold. Subject to admissibility of the granulations and the further restriction of equirepresentability, it is possible to compare correspondences sensibly with classical RST-RYS. But strong similarity remains a quasi-order relation. We investigate subnatural correspondences in the contexts considered in [2] below.\nThe restriction to SNC means that we restrict attention to successor neighborhoods or neighborhoods.

The corresponding concepts for pre-natural correspondences will be denoted by PNC(S1, S2), PNM(S1, S2) and PNMs(S1, S2) and those for proto-natural correspondences by POC(S1, S2), POCs(S1, S2), POM(S1, S2) and POMs(S1, S2) respectively. If S1 = S2 = S, then the notation will be simplified to SNC(S) and the like. For simplicity, we will restrict ourselves to the cases with just one lower and one upper approximation operations on S1 and S2 in all that follows. The RYS corresponding to classical RST will be denoted by R. We will also use C to denote any one the sets of maps above.\nTheorem 5. On the set SNC(S1, S2) and on each of the sets of maps defined above, we can define an induced order via \u03d5 \u2264 \u03c3 iff (\u2200x \u2208 S1)\u03d5(x) \u2286 \u03c3(x). This extends to all other sets of maps defined above. It also extends to all other cases where S2 has a partial order on it.\nIn general other induced point-wise operations may not be uniquely definable always in any unique sense without additional constraints. The exceptions are stated after the following theorem.\nProposition 6. On C, we can define following the partial operations\n\u2022 For f, g \u2208 C, f\u2295 g = h \u2208 C iff h \u2208 C and\n(\u2200x \u2208 S1)h(x) = f(x)\u22952 g(x).\n\u2022 For f, g \u2208 C, f\u2299 g = h \u2208 C iff h \u2208 C and\n(\u2200x \u2208 S1)h(x) = f(x)\u22992 g(x).\n\u2022 For f,\u2208 C, \u223c f = h \u2208 C iff h \u2208 C and\n(\u2200x \u2208 S1)h(x) =\u223c f(x).\nA similar point-wise definition of lower and upper approximation operations is not possible.\nTheorem 6. On each of POC(S1, S2), POCs(S1, S2), POM(S1, S2) and POMs(S1, S2), the following are admissible:\n1) For f, g \u2208 C, f\u2295 g = h \u2208 C iff\n(\u2200x \u2208 S1)h(x) = f(x)\u22952 g(x).\n2) For f, g \u2208 C, f\u2299 g = h \u2208 C iff\n(\u2200x \u2208 S1)h(x) = f(x)\u22992 g(x).\n3) For f,\u2208 C, \u223c f = h \u2208 C iff (\u2200x \u2208 S1)h(x) =\u223c f(x). 4) For f,\u2208 C, fl = h \u2208 C iff (\u2200x \u2208 S1)h(x) = (f(x))l. 5) For f,\u2208 C, fu = h \u2208 C iff (\u2200x \u2208 S1)h(x) = (f(x))u.\nProof: The proof consists in verifying that h in each of the cases does indeed belong to C. For POC(S1, S2), the following holds: there is a term function t in the signature of S2 such that (\u2200x \u2208 G1)(\u2203y1, . . . yn \u2208 G2)f(x) = t(y1, . . . , yn).\nA. Relation to real-valued measures of RST\nWe consider the relation to the concept of degree of rough inclusion in classical RST first. Suppose S1, S2 are two RYS corresponding to classical RST and let k1, k2 be the respective rough inclusion functions on them respectively. For any two elements X, Y \u2208 S1, these are computed according to\nk1(X, Y) =\n \n\n#(X \u2229 Y) #(X) , ifX 6= \u2205, 1, else,\nIf f \u2208 POC(S1, S2), then we can say very little about k2(f(X), f(Y)) from the value of k1(X, Y) or conversely. If the size of all granules involved and their occurrences and the term functions involved in the representation are known then we can possibly actualize some ordering. The converse question is worse. Examples are quite easy to construct for this. Even if S1 = S2 and granules are related by the identity function, there is no definite connection as the possible values of f(Z), when Z is a non-definite element are not restricted in any way. The situation for SNC(S1, S2) is similar to that of POC(S1, S2). These aspects transform radically when we restrict the algebraic considerations to collections of approximations or definite elements.\nTheorem 7. If S1, S2 are RYS corresponding to classical RST and f \u2208 POC(S1, S2), then there exists a term function h such that (\u2200B \u2208 \u03b4(S1)(\u2203G1, . . . Gk \u2208 G2)h(G1, . . . , Gk) = f(B)). Further, we may be able to classify such term functions as decreasing, increasing or indefinite relative the relation between the measure functions k1, k2.\nProof: It is clear that if B \u2208 \u03b4(S1) then (\u2203H1, . . . , Hr \u2208 G1 \u22c3\nHi = B. For each of these Hi, there is a term t such that f(Hi) = t(P1, . . . , Pb), with Pi \u2208 G\u2208. But the term on the right hand side must be a definite element because of the admissible operations on the RYS and so must be a union of granules.\nBecause of this we have, (\u2200B \u2208 \u03b4(S1)(\u2203G1, . . . Gk \u2208 G2)h(G1, . . . , Gk) = f(B)).\nTheorem 8. In the above theorem, if we modify the conditions as per\n\u2022 S2 is a RYS corresponding to a tolerance approximation space and \u2022 f \u2208 SNC(S1, S2),\nthen the result fails to hold in many situations as term functions acting on granules can yield non-definite elements..\nA simple morphism between two RYS need not preserve granules or definite elements. So f is a morphism that satisfies no other condition then the first conclusion of the first theorem need not necessarily follow. We show this below:\nProposition 7. If S1, S2 are RYS corresponding to classical RST and f \u2208 Mor(S1, S2), then there need not exist a term function h such that (\u2200B \u2208 \u03b4(S1)(\u2203G1, . . . Gk \u2208 G2)h(G1, . . . , Gk) = f(B)).\nProof: We construct the required counter-example below: Let X1 = {x1, x2, x3, x4} and let the equivalence Q be generated on it by {(x1, x2), (x2, x3)}. Taking the granules to be the set of Q-related elements, we have\nG1 = {(x1 : x2, x3), (x2 : x1, x3), (x3 : x2, x1), (x4 :)}.\nHere (x1 : x2, x1) means the successor neighborhood (granule) generated by x1 is (x1, x2, x3).\nLet X2 = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5} and let the equivalence R be generated on it by {(a1, a4), (a4, a2)}. Taking the granules to be the R-classes, we have G2 = {(a1 : a2, a4), (a2 : a1, a4), (a3 :), (a4 : a1, a2), (a5 :)}.\nLet S1, S2 be the RYS on the power sets \u2118(X1, \u2118(X2) respectively.\nIf \u03c3 : S1 7\u2212\u2192 S2 is a morphism satisfying \u03d5({x1}) = {a1}, \u03d5({x2}) = {a1}, \u03d5({x3} = {a3}) and \u03d5({x4} = {a4}). Under the conditions \u03c3 is an morphism that is such that the class (x1 : x2, x3) is mapped to {a1, a3}, but the latter is not representable in terms of the other granules using \u2295,\u2299 and even complementation.\nTheorem 9. But in general as morphisms need to preserve the parthood (corresponding to inclusion or union), we have in the above context, (\u2203\u03b1,\u03b2 \u2208 R)(\u2200X, Y \u2208f S1)\u03b1k1(X, Y) \u2264 k2(\u03c3(X), \u03c3(Y)) \u2264 \u03b2k2(X, Y). \u2208f means \u2019finite element of\u2019. It is necessary that the greatest \u03b1 and least \u03b2 must exist.\nNext we look at elements of SMs(S1, S2).\nTheorem 10. If S1, S2 are RYS corresponding to classical RST and f \u2208 SMs(S1, S2), then (\u2200B \u2208 \u03b4(S1)(\u2203G1, . . . Gk \u2208 G2) \u22c3\n(G1, . . . , Gk) = f(B)). The following condition need not hold even with the additional requirement of #(S1) = #(S2): (\u2203\u03b1 \u2208 R)(\u2200X, Y \u2208 S1)k1(X, Y) = \u03b1k2(f(X), f(Y)).\nProof: Definite elements are unions of granules in S2. So from the previous considerations it follows that (\u2200B \u2208 \u03b4(S1)(\u2203G1, . . . Gk \u2208 G2) \u22c3\n(G1, . . . , Gk) = f(B)). For the second part, all we need to do is to require dissimilar size and number of granules in S1 and S2. Counterexamples are not hard.\nThe converse question on the second condition in the above theorem with no assumptions on the nature of f is directionless.\nTheorem 11. If S1, S2 are RYS corresponding to classical RST and f \u2208 PNM(S1, S2), then there exists a term function h such that\n(\u2200B \u2208 \u03b4(S1)(\u2203G1, . . . Gk \u2208 G2)h(G1, . . . , Gk) = f(B)).\nFurther, we may be able to classify such term functions as decreasing, increasing or indefinite relative the relation between the measure functions k1, k2.\nProof: Since f \u2208 Mor(S1, S2), so any union of granules will be mapped to a union of images of granules. But each image of a granule must be represented by a term function acting on a set of granules in S2. As compositions of\nterms are terms, it follows that (\u2200B \u2208 \u03b4(S1)(\u2203G1, . . . Gk \u2208 G2)h(G1, . . . , Gk) = f(B)).\nB. Putting it Together\nGiven the nature of concepts introduced, we can expect some weak connections between nature of \u2019growth\u2019 of correspondences and their type. Specifically these can be about monotonicity being induced generally or on a quotient. This will useful for simplifying the theory and applications. Here we consider a few specific cases alone. A more thorough investigation will be part of future work.\nThe first theorem concerns self-maps.\nTheorem 12. If S is the RYS corresponding to classical RST, f \u2208 SMs(S), g \u2208 SNC(S) and g \u2208 \u0398lu(f), then there is a filter H of S such that\n(\u2200x \u2208 \u03b4(S) \u2229H)g(x) = f(x).\nProof: Suppose x \u2208 \u03b4(S), then (\u2203zi \u2208 G) \u22c3\nzi = x. Suppose zo is a fixed element in \u00a7c and (\u2200zo \u2282 z)f(z)l \u2286 g(z)subseteqf(z)u . If zo \u2282 x, then f(x)l = ( \u22c3 f(zi)) l = \u22c3\nf(zi) \u2286 g( \u22c3 zi)subseteq \u22c3\nf(zi). So (\u2200x \u2208 \u03b4(S) \u2229 zo \u2191, we have g(x) = f(x).\nProposition 8. If S1, S2 are RYS corresponding to classical RST and f, g \u2208 SMs(S1, S2) and g \u2208 \u0398lu(f), then there exists a congruence \u03c1 on S1 such that the induced quotient morphisms [f], [g] coincide on \u03b4(S1|\u03c1).\nTheorem 13. If S1, S2 are arbitrary lattice ordered RYS with the operations \u2295,\u2299 corresponding to the lattice orders P2 on S2 and f \u2208 SMs(S1, S2), then on \u0398lu(f)\u2229SMs(S1, S2), the following point-wise operations are well defined (for simplicity we will assume a single pair of lower and upper approximation operators):\n\u2022 (\u2200g, h)(\u2200x \u2208 S1)(g \u2295 h)(x) = g(x)\u2295 h(x). \u2022 (\u2200g, h)(\u2200x \u2208 S1)(g \u2299 h)(x) = g(x)\u2299 h(x). \u2022 (\u2200h)(\u2200x \u2208 S1)(hL)(x) = (h(x))l&(hU)(x) = (h(x))u.\nProof: We have (\u2203zo \u2208 S1c)(\u2200z)(P1zoz \u2212\u2192 P2f(z)lg(z)&P2g(z)f(z)u and (\u2203z1 \u2208 S1c)(\u2200z)(P1z1z \u2212\u2192 P2f(z)lh(z)&P2h(z)f(z)u. As P2 is a lattice order, we can definitely conclude that (\u2200z)(P1(zo\u2228z1)z \u2212\u2192 P2f(z)l(g(z)\u2295 h(z))&P2(g(z)\u2295 h(z))f(z)u.\nSimilarly the other parts can be proved.\nTheorem 14. In the above theorem, we can replace SMs(S1, S2) uniformly with SM(S1, S2).\nC. Extended Example\nLet X1 = {x1, x2, x3, x4} and let the tolerance T be generated on it by {(x1, x2), (x2, x3)}. Taking the granules to be the set of T -related elements, we have G1 = {(x1 : x2), (x2 : x1, x3), (x3 : x2), (x4 :)}. Here (x1 : x2) means the successor neighborhood (granule) generated by x1 is (x1, x2).\nLet X2 = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5} and let the equivalence R be generated on it by {(a1, a4), (a4, a2)}. Taking the granules\nto be the R-classes, we have G2 = {(a1 : a2, a4), (a2 : a1, a4), (a3 :), (a4 : a1, a2), (a5 :)}.\nLet S1, S2 be the RYS on the power sets \u2118(X1), \u2118(X2) respectively. If \u03d5 : S1 7\u2212\u2192 S2 is a injective map satisfying \u03d5({x1, x2}) = {a1, a2, a4}, \u03d5({x2, x1, x3}) = {a2, a1, a4} \u222a {a3}, \u03d5({x3, x2} = {a5}) and \u03d5({x4} = {a3}). Then \u03d5 is an example of a SNC that cannot be a \u2295-morphism.\nLet \u03c3 : S1 7\u2212\u2192 S2 be a \u2295-morphism satisfying \u03c3({x1}) = {a1}, \u03c3({x2}) = {a2}, \u03c3({x3} = {a3}) and \u03c3({x4} = {a4}).\nProposition 9. \u03c3 is an injective \u2295-morphism that fails to be a sub-natural correspondence.\nProof: The class (x1 : x2) is mapped to {a1, a2}, but the latter is not representable in terms of the other granules using \u2295,\u2299.\nIf \u03c4 : S1 7\u2212\u2192 S2 is a map satisfying \u03c4({x1}) = {a3}, \u03c4({x2}) = {a5}, \u03c4({x3} = {a3}) and \u03c4({x4} = {a5}), then \u03c4 is not injective on granules and is a proto-natural correspondence. Some of these proto-natural correspondences are also morphisms. It is possible to define a number of PNCs that are greater than \u03d5 by minimal modification of \u03d5. For example, we can add an extra granule to \u03d5({x3})."}, {"heading": "VI. CONTAMINATION AND CLASSICAL RST", "text": "The requirements of a contamination-free semantics at Meta-R for classical RST may seen to be\n\u2022 The objects of interest are roughly equivalent sets. \u2022 The operations used in the semantics are as\ncontamination-free as is possible. \u2022 The logical constants in the associated logic are as real\n(or actualizable) as is possible.\nThe last two criteria are very closely related and one may be expected to determine the other. The first of the three criteria is fairly clear, but the second and third are relative the meaning in the intended use of the semantics.\nThe natural way of realizing the contamination of operations relative basic operations would be through some concept of definability or representability. Taking orders on rough objects as basic predicates, we can for example regard \u2294 as a noncontaminated operation in pre-rough/rough algebras (as it is definable). From the point of view of representation as a term, \u2294 would be contaminated as higher order constructions would be required. It is also possible to regard the pre-rough/rough algebra or equivalent semantics as being essentially overdetermined and so the problem would be of weakening the semantics. Key properties that determine the last two requirements relate to level of perception of rough inclusion and bigness. \u2294,\u2293 may be basic operations or these may not be due to constructive limitations or the extraction of least upper and greatest lower bound is done in a sloppy fashion (lazy order). This is very important in modeling human reasoning. In many contexts the bounds may be dependent on the relative bigness or otherwise of the outcome of the specific instance of \u2294 or \u2293. The bigness based cases are not about over-determination of the problem and can be associated with filters, ideals and\nintervals (or generalisations thereof) of different types in most cases and then would be semantically amenable.\nA. Relevant Big Rough Algebras\nIf S is a finite approximation space (finiteness can be relaxed), and if \u2118(S)| \u2248 is the poset of roughly equal objects ordered by rough inclusion \u2291, then we know that the operations \u2294,\u2293 are definable in it by way of \u2291 being a lattice order. But a definition of these by terms would not be possible over the pre-rough algebraic system \u3008\u2118(S)| \u2248,\u2264, L,\u00ac, 0, 1\u3009 (the superfluous operations over pre-rough algebras [11] are omitted). Analogous considerations apply to other variants of aggregation and commonality in classical RST. Missing proofs will appear separately.\nProposition 10. In the theory of finite classical RST-RYS, it is possible to define the interpretation of the operations \u2294 and \u2293 over \u2118(S)| \u2248.\nProof: Since \u2248 is a derived predicate, the representations of the operations can be carried over.\nThe following concepts of filters and ideals capture the concept of closure under types aggregation and commonality operations and consequence operators. Importantly some filters and ideals can be regarded as sufficiently big or not big subdomains.\nDefinition 10. An arbitrary subset K of \u2118(S)| \u2248= Q will be said to be a L-Filter iff it satisfies F0 and O1. If in addition it satisfies F1, then it will said to be prime. K will be an o-filter if it satisfies F0 alone :\n\u2022 F0: (\u2200x \u2208 K)(\u2200y \u2208 Q)(x \u2264 y \u21d2 y \u2208 K). \u2022 O1: (\u2200x \u2208 K)Lx \u2208 K. \u2022 F1: (\u2200a, b \u2208 Q)(1 6= a \u2294 b \u2208 K \u21d2 a \u2208 K or b \u2208 K).\nThe dual notions will be that of U-Ideals, prime U-ideals and o-ideals. If a L-filter is closed under \u2293,\u2294, then it will be termed a lattice L-filter. Let K = \u3008K,\u2264, L, U,\u00ac, 1\u3009 be the induced partial algebraic system on K.\nProposition 11. If K is a lattice L-filter, then K is not a prerough algebra, but satisfies:\n1) \u2264 is a distributive lattice order. 2) Closure under L,U, but not under \u00ac. 3) Lx \u2264 x ; L(a \u2293 b) = La \u2293 Lb; LLx = Lx; 4) L1 = 1; ULx = Lx; L(a \u2294 b) = La \u2294 Lb\nProof: If we assume finiteness, then the lattice is bounded. But we would have no way (in general) of ensuring closure under \u00ac, 0. The three element pre-rough algebra provides the required counterexample.\nProposition 12. If K is a L-filter, then K satisfies: 1) \u2264 is a join-semilattice lattice order (\u2294 is definable). 2) Closure under L,U, but not under the partial lattice\noperation \u2293 and \u00ac. 3) Lx \u2264 x ; L(a \u2293 b) w = La \u2293 Lb; LLx = Lx; 4) L1 = 1; ULx = Lx; L(a\u2294b) = La\u2294Lb ; x\u2294(y\u2293x) w = x. 5) x \u2294 (y \u2293 z) w = (x \u2294 y) \u2293 (x \u2294 z) and its dual.\nProof: If a\u2293b \u2208 K, then L(a\u2293b) \u2208 K by definition and so La, Lb, a, b \u2208 K. If La, Lb \u2208 K, then it is possible that La \u2293 Lb /\u2208 K, which is the reason for the weak equality.\nTheorem 15. There exists a pre-rough algebra S with a nontrivial lattice L-filter K satisfying\n(\u2203a, b \u2208 S \\ {1})(\u2200c \u2208 K \\ {1})a \u2294 b q c.\nThe proof involves a simple construction, but the point we want to make is that K \\ {1} may or may not be cofinal in S \\ {1}. This is important as such a K may be interpreted to consist of big elements alone. We will refer to such L-filters or lattice L-filters as cofine.\nTheorem 16. Given a pre-rough algebra with no nontrivial lattice L-filters, we can construct an infinite number of prerough algebras with the same property.\nProof: We suggest a completely visual proof for this. Simply paste a pair of three element pre-rough algebras to the original pre-rough algebra (identifying all the tops and bottoms respectively) and require that the negation of one of the non boundary element is the other. The infinite number of pre-rough algebras follow by recursive application of the process.\nA second proof can be through the fact that the product of two pre-rough algebras with the property satisfies the property.\nDefinition 11. Given a L-filter K on Q, for any x, y \u2208 Q let\nx \u22d2 y =\n{ x \u2294 y if x \u2294 y \u2208 K\nundefined otherwise.\nx \u22d3 y =\n{ x \u2293 y if x \u2293 y \u2208 K\nundefined otherwise.\nFurther let x\u2701 y iff x = y or x \u22d3 y = x or x \u22d2 y = y.\nProposition 13. The relation \u2701 is a partial order that is not necessarily a lattice order, but is compatible with the operations L,U. Further the restriction of \u2701 to K has already been described above.\nProof: Absorption laws can be shown to fail in most prerough algebras for a suitable choice of a L-filter.\nDefinition 12. By a operationally contamination-free prerough algebraic system (or OCPR system), we will mean a partial algebraic system of the form Y = \u2329 Q,\u2701, L, U,\u22d2,\u22d3, 0, 1 \u232a\n, with the operations and relations being as defined above (U is the operation induced by upper approximation operator on Q).\nDefinition 13. By a OC-system (resp lattice OC-system) we will mean a pair of the form \u2329 Q,K \u232a\nconsisting of a pre-rough algebra Q and a L-filter (resp. lattice L-filter ) K. If K is cofine, then we will refer to the system as being cofine.\nTheorem 17. 1) If K is a lattice L-filter, then K+ = {y :: (\u2200x \u2208 K)x \u2294 y = 1} with induced operations from the\npre-rough algebra is a lattice L-filter. Such filters will be termed supremal. 2) K is a cofine lattice L-filter iff K+ = {1}. 3) The collection of all supremal lattice L-filters can be\nboolean ordered with an order distinct from the order on lattice L-filters.\nThus starting from a standard rough domain (corresponding to pre-rough algebras), we have arrived at new rough semantic domains. At least two distinct partial algebras can be defined with one being an extension of a pre-rough algebra, while OCpre-rough systems constitute a severe generalization. The natural correspondences from a pre-rough algebra to a cofine Lfilter (or lattice L-filter) would be forgetful closed morphisms that preserves all operations except for \u00ac.\nRemarks\nIn this research paper, we have developed the mathematics of fine-grained comparison of one RYS with another and of reducing contamination of operations. The process has involved a number of steps including the exactification of the concept of granular rough evolution, identification of various types of correspondences, concepts of comparison of those correspondences and algebraisation of concepts of relevance/bigness. These constitute an alternative/ supplement to the earlier approach to measures due to the present author in [1] and of course the usual real-valued measures of RST. The number of types of correspondences has also been expanded upon relative [2] and more properties have been established. As per the new approach comparison with classical rough set semantics or any other rough semantics should essentially be constructed by the force of granular axioms.\nThis Paper is a peprint of the paper presented in FUZZIEEE\u20192013 and is also available in IEEE Xplore:10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2013.6622521"}], "references": [{"title": "Dialectics of Counting and the Mathematics of Vagueness", "author": ["A.
