It was popularized to the general public in an article by Martin Gardner [12]. It can be played on any subset of a square lattice, though mostly it is restricted to rectangular m\u00d7n boards, where m denotes the number of rows and n the number of columns. The version introduced by Andersson and Gardner was the 8\u00d7 8 board.\nPlay consists of the two players alternately placing a 1\u00d72 tile (domino) on the board, where the first player may place the tile only in a vertical alignment, the second player only horizontally. The first player being unable to move loses the game, his opponent (who made the last move) being declared the winner. Since the board is gradually filled, i.e., Domineering is a converging game, the game always ends, and ties are impossible. With these rules the game belongs to the category of combinatorial games, for which a whole theory (the Combinatorial Game Theory, or CGT in short) has been developed.\nAmong combinatorial game theorists Domineering received quite some attention, but this was limited to rather small or irregular boards [1,3,4,10,14,23].\nLarger (rectangular) boards were solved using \u03b1-\u03b2 search [15], leading to solving all boards up to the standard 8\u00d7 8 board [7], later extended to the 9\u00d7 9 board [13,17], and finally extended to larger boards up to 10\u00d7 10 [8,9]."}, {"heading": "2 Three Approaches", "text": "The following subsections give a rough characterization of the two main programs used to systematically solve Domineering positions so far, and of the program used to obtain the new results, as described in this paper.\n2.1 A Brute-Force Appoach: Domi\nThe first systematic analysis of rectangular Domineering boards was performed by Breuker et al. [7,13,17]. They developed the program Domi, using a straightforward variant of the \u03b1-\u03b2 technique [15], enhanced with a transposition table. The algorithm did not use perfect domain knowledge for classifying positions as wins or losses and hence can be characterized as a pure brute-force approach. Transposition tables with 2M (221) entries were used with a two-level replacement scheme called TwoBig [6], in which each entry can store two table positions. Mirror symmetries are taken into account. The newest position is always stored, overwriting the less important position in terms of nodes investigated.\n2.2 A Knowledge-Based Approach: Obsequi\nA few years later Nathan Bullock published results on solving Domineering boards up to the 10\u00d7 10 board [9]. His program Obsequi used a sophisticated evaluation function which can determine statically the winner at a shallower point in the search tree than Domi did. This allowed the elimination of large portions of the search space, resulting in much more efficient solving of Domineering boards. Obsequi used a transposition table (taking mirror symmetries into account) with 223 entries with either a two-level TwoBig replacement scheme or a one-level replacement scheme called FindFirst [8]. Also, a much better moveordering heuristic was used, plus the use of a dominance relation to prune provably irrelevant moves. Since the main advantage of Bullock\u2019s program is based on game-specific knowledge, we can characterize his approach as a knowledge-based approach.\n2.3 A Knowledge-Intensive Approach: MUDoS\nUiterwijk continued using game-specific knowledge to an even more detailed extent. His program MUDoS incorporated deep knowledge of Domineering positions with known result. These knowledge rules are so intense, that it even enables solving many game boards without any search at all (i.e., investigating a single node, the empty board under consideration). This was called perfectly solving [18]. The most important feature of these knowledge rules is the number\nof safe moves that a player provably can reach in a position [19,20,21]. The transposition table used (again taking mirror symmetries into account) contained 226 entries, with a simple one-level Deep replacement scheme. Due to the heavy use of very knowledge-intense rules based on game-specific properties we can characterize his approach as a knowledge-intensive approach."}, {"heading": "3 New Results", "text": "After almost half a year of computation time, 11\u00d7 11 Domineering was solved. We give some data in Section 3.1. As a sidetrack, we solved several other new boards. Data are given in Section 3.2. An overview of updated combinatorialgame-theoretic values of Domineering boards is given in Section 3.3."}, {"heading": "3.1 The Solution of 11 \u00d7 11 Domineering", "text": "The solution of 11\u00d7 11 Domineering took 174 days and 15 hours on a standard desktop computer (a HP with duo core Intel E8400 3.00 GHz CPU with a 64-bit Windows 7 operating system and 4 GB internal memory). TheMUDoS program is written in C#.\nThe result is that the first player under optimal play wins the game. Since the board is square, this is irrespective of Vertical or Horizontal moving first.\nTo put the solution of the 11\u00d711 board into perspective, we show in Table 1 the results and number of nodes investigated to solve square boards up to 11\u00d711 by the three programs mentioned in the previous section.\nFor the result the investigation of 259,689,994,008 nodes was needed, with an average speed of 17,211 nodes/sec. While this is some ten times slower than Obsequi\u2019s speed, this decrease in speed is by far compensated by the much higher pruning efficiency, as evidenced by the ratio\u2019s of the number of nodes investigated by MUDoS and Obsequi. For the 8\u00d7 8, 9\u00d7 9 and 10\u00d7 10 boards these are 1.19%, 0.30%, and 0.00038%, respectively. Of course the latest number is so low, since Obsequi solved the 10 \u00d7 10 board on a distributed network of several computers (no further details given), without memory sharing, by which transposition tables will be far less effective. But as a striking fact, whereas Obsequi needed several months of computation time on this network, MUDoS needs only 21 minutes on a single computer to solve the 10\u00d7 10 board."}, {"heading": "3.2 The Solution of New Other Domineering Boards", "text": "Besides 11\u00d711 Domineering we were able to solve several other new Domineering boards. The results are given in Table 2.\nThe most notable results and their consequences are given below. We there use the notion of outcome class [10,4,1] of an m\u00d7 n board, denoted by [m\u00d7 n], where an outcome class is N, P, V, or H (1st = Next player; 2nd = Previous player; Vertical, irrespective of who starts; Horizontal, irrespective of who starts).\nOther boards with width or heigth 11 Although the 10\u00d7 11 board was already solved (Vertical wins), using the translational symmetry rules of Lachmann c.s. [16], and even perfectly solved [18], the 11\u00d7 10 board was not. However, MUDoS solves it investigating just 1 node, showing that Horizontal wins.2 As a result [10 \u00d7 11] = V (and [11 \u00d7 10] = H).\n2 We note that solving a board investigating a single node is not exactly the same as perfectly solving a board, since in the latter the board is solved using characteristics of the board solely, without generating the possible moves, whereas in the former the possible moves are generated, but immediately proven to contain at least one winning move or only losing moves.\nFurther, with some more work, we were able to solve the 9\u00d7 11 board (Horizontal wins) and the 11\u00d7 9 board (Vertical wins). Consequently, [9\u00d7 11] = H (and [11\u00d7 9] = V).\nBoards with width or heigth 6 The 6 \u00d7 17 and 17 \u00d7 6 boards were also solved (wins for Horizontal and Vertical, respectively). Consequently, [6\u00d7 17] = H. Moreover, using the translational symmetry rules of Lachmann c.s. [16] and the facts that [6\u00d7 4] = N and [6\u00d7 n] with n = 8, 12, and 14 are H, it follows that [6 \u00d7 21] (17+4) = N or H, and [6\u00d7 25] (17+8) = H, [6\u00d7 29] (17+12) = H, and [6\u00d7 31] (17+14) = H. Moreover, in [11] it was shown that [6\u00d7n] for n > 31 = N or H for widths 33, 35, 37, 39, 43, 45, 47, 51, and 59. Using the result for [6\u00d7 17] all these values analogously are determined to be H, the only exception being width 35 (still N or H). This shows that the holes in the results for boards of height 6 have considerably been filled. The outcome classes for all 6 \u00d7 n boards are known now, the only exceptions being the 6\u00d718, 6\u00d721, 6\u00d723, 6\u00d727, and 6\u00d735 boards, all five having outcome classes N or H, which means that Horizontal at least wins as first player. Of course the results for [m\u00d7 6] can similarly be updated, replacing H by V.\nBoards with width or heigth 8 The 8\u00d7 12 and 12\u00d7 8 boards were also solved (wins for Horizontal and Vertical, respectively). Consequently, [8\u00d7 12] = H, but also, using the translational symmetry rules and the facts that [8\u00d7 10] and [8\u00d7 16] are H, it follows that [8\u00d7 22] (12+10) = H, [8\u00d7 24] (12+12) = H, and [8\u00d7 28] (12+16) = H. Moreover, since [8\u00d710] = H and all [8\u00d7n] for even n from 20\u201328 are H, it follows that all [8\u00d7n] with even n \u2265 20 are H. This makes the entries in the 8 \u00d7 n row completely regular for even n from n = 20 onwards, in contrast to [11], were (in an irregular way) some of those were determined to be H, the others as N or H. We also were able to solve the 14\u00d78 board (Vertical wins), but not the 8\u00d714 board yet. This means that [8\u00d7 14] = N or H. This leaves the 8\u00d7 14 and 8 \u00d7 18 boards as the only holes in this row for even width. Finally, the 8\u00d7 15 (and 12\u00d7 15) board is trivially solved to be a Vertical win (so outcome class N or V), but the rotated 15 \u00d7 8 (and 15 \u00d7 12) board could not yet be determined. Again, of course the results for [m\u00d7 8] can similarly be updated, replacing H by V, including that all [m\u00d7 8] with even m \u2265 20 are V."}, {"heading": "3.3 Updated Table of CGT Values of Domineering", "text": "In Table 3 we give a complete updated overview of all results for solved Domineering boards, as outcome classes. The results are taken from [11] and includes results from [10,4,3,7,17,9,13,16,11].3 In addition, our new results have been added. This table is also available at [22], where any future updates will be made public.\n3 Although Drummond-Cole determined the outcome classes for 8\u00d7 26 and 26\u00d7 8 (H and V), these results were not included in his table of known outcome classes for Domineering [11].\n6 J o s W\n.H .M\n.

All boards solved before are solved in an equal amount (for the trivial boards) or far smaller (for the more complex boards) number of investigated nodes than by previous solvers.\nThe efficiency of our solver enabled the solution of the 11\u00d7 11 Domineering board. The result indicates that the first player wins. Moreover, several new rather complex boards have been solved. Applying these together with the use of the translational symmetry rules updated the Domineering outcome class landscape considerably.\nRegarding future work, foremost this condensed overview will be extended to a full publication. This will include a detailed description ofMUDoS\u2019 knowledge rules and heuristics employed. Moreover, the impact of the rules and heuristics on solving performance, separately and in combination, will be illlustrated with experiments.\nAs a follow-up we moreover intend as a last step to enhance the solving power of our Domineering program by incorporating knowledge from Combinatorial Game Theory into our solver. A preliminary experiment using endgame databases up to 16 squares filled with CGT values, combined with a very simplistic \u03b1-\u03b2 solver showed reductions up to 99% for boards up to 7\u00d7 7 [2]."}], "references": [{"title": "Lessons in Play: An Introduction to Combinatorial Game Theory", "author": ["M.H.

(Maastricht University Domineering Solver) that solves Domineering positions in a very efficient way.

More importantly, it enables the solution of the 11 \u00d7 11 Domineering board, a board up till now far out of reach of previous Domineering solvers. The solution needed the investigation of 259,689,994,008 nodes, using almost half a year of computation time on a single simple desktop computer. The results show that under optimal play the first player wins the 11\u00d711 Domineering game, irrespective if Vertical or Horizontal starts the game. In addition, several other boards hitherto unsolved were solved. Using the convention that Vertical starts, the 8 \u00d7 15, 11 \u00d7 9, 12 \u00d7 8, 12 \u00d7 15, 14 \u00d7 8, and 17 \u00d7 6 boards are all won by Vertical, whereas the 6 \u00d7 17, 8\u00d7 12, 9\u00d7 11, and 11\u00d7 10 boards are all won by Horizontal.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
