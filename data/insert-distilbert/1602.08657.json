The first parameter QuotationFinder uses is quantitative: Every word in the source (search text entered) gets points as it is matched in the target (set number of lines contained in the TLG/CLCLT.) If a word occurs n times in the source, it gets points n times as it is matched in the target. This means that if the word occurs only once in the source, but multiple times in the target, it still only gets points once (otherwise, special texts like entries in Suda, the 10th century encyclopedia, would get too many points.)"}, {"heading": "2.2 Quality", "text": "When ranking matches, QuotationFinder awards 3 points when the exact form of the word in the source text (entered in the search form) is found in the target (TLG/CLCLT).

As we can never know in advance which ones of our source text\u2019s words are going to be matched in the target text (as the author quoting may leave out any of them,) we cannot use any of their positions as reference points. So, QuotationFinder has to establish a \u201ccore\u201d of the potential quotation first in order to gain a basis for these calculations. It does so by determining where in the target text the position of the matched words relative to each other most resembles the relative position of these words in the search text. During development, by a process of trial and error, the relation of the points awarded for quantity, quality, rarity, density, and order was fine-tuned so as to establish a convincing rank order from exact quotation to loose verbal parallel. It proved useful to add up the points for quantity, quality and rarity, divide the sum by 3, then add the points for density multiplied times 2, and finally add the points for order.\n3 Journal of Data Mining and Digital Humanities http://jdmdh.episciences.org ISSN 2416-5999, an open-access journal\nQuotationFinder was no longer updated after 2008 as the TLG ceased to be published on CDROM. Some of the ideas presented in this article may be of use as new software searching for quotations and allusions is developed. Conclusion In antiquity, people were not as strict as modern scholars in terms of the precision with which one was expected to follow the source when quoting (cf. [Schwerdtner, 2015], p. 34.) Classical authors may or may not provide explicit markers in their texts helping readers to note that they are quoting from or alluding to prior texts. When designing search software, it seems best to take into account a wide range of features indicative of quotations and allusions \u2014 like the number and forms of words matched, their proximity to each other, how rare they are, and in what sequence they occur, as was done with QuotationFinder.

A search with a Boolean \u201cand,\u201d however, would yield too few, as ancient authors often left out words when quoting without us having a chance to know in advance which ones they would keep. QuotationFinder produces better search results by using five criteria for determining if a given text is a quotation or an allusion: number and forms of words matched, their proximity to each other, how rare they are, and in what sequence they occur. I QUOTING IN ANTIQUITY Designing software algorithms for finding quotations and allusions is not as straightforward as it may seem. In antiquity, authors did not use quotation marks or italics (though copyists or editors may have added these,) so that there is no simple obvious token in the text that search software could work with. In some contexts, one single word that the target and the source text have in common may suffice to constitute an allusion \u2013 for example if the context in the target names the source text, its author, the character originally uttering the word, or a phrase like \u201cas it is written\u201d (cf. [Schwerdtner, 2015] p. 26-27, [Plett, 1991] p. 9.) Authors may quote verbatim or they may assimilate the material to the target context (cf. [Plett 1988] p. 70-71.) Variations regarding syntax and semantics may occur \u2013 omissions, additions, changes in word forms, substitutions of words, etc. (cf. [Plett, 1991] p. 9.) Formally, quotations vary greatly from each other (cf. [Schwerdtner, 2015] p. 25.39.) Quotation search engines should not be rigid in the way they look for formal features typical of quotations. The best approach seems to be to establish a score for every feature and rank potential quotations and allusions based on the sum of the scores they achieve regarding each of the features (cf. [Tischer, 2010] p. 103-106.)", "creator": "Word"}}}
