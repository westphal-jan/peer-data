Introduction", "text": "Nonverbal communication is a key factor in the interaction between individuals, replacing or amplifying spoken words. Our body language, voice pitch, intonation and volume, movement of our pupils or our chronemics choices are just a few examples emphasizing the richness of human communication skills [32]. A special subset of nonverbal interactions, explored in this paper, is based on facial expressions. Their perception initiates rapid cognitive processes in the brain and have both communicative and reflexive components [12]. They assist in verbal communication by providing context to what we are saying, making their recognition important for studying social interactions.\nWe use computers on a daily basis, interacting with artificial agents in increasing number of tasks. Advances in speech and natural language processing have presented us with personalized smart agents [42, 11], while examining our facial gestures has provided a richer set of tools for improving human computer interaction [9]. In the last two decades we have seen several attempts to automate the way computers respond towards human emotions [23, 6, 2], where the ultimate goal is to create humanoid robots which can blend in the environment [53].\nUnfortunately this task is hard to solve, and current state-\nof-the-art results are far from satisfactory. Recent advances in machine learning have shown that if we provide a neural network with enough samples, it can learn very complex structures [15]. Today hard tasks in computer vision, such as labeling images, recognizing objects and faces or classifying videos have become a feasible task for computers which can now provide competitive results to humans and sometimes even outperform them [37, 45].\nIn this paper we focus on facial gesture recognition from videos using deep neural networks. We tackle the problem of a small size labeled dataset, and present a new layer which compensates for velocity changes in the time domain. We compare our methods to multiple techniques and datasets, as well as presenting our own collected data, and we report state-of-the-art results in almost every category.\nWe hope to empower researchers in this area by providing them with a huge dataset which can help them build even bigger and better deep neural networks, while eliminating the need to spend several months required to acquire a dataset of such proportions, and for some living under limited resources acquiring such a dataset can be prohibitively impossible. We summarize our contributions by:"}, {"heading": "1.1. Contributions", "text": "1.

Related Work", "text": "Machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines have been used for facial expression recognition given the movement of facial fiducial points [24, 33, 41, 10] achieving real time performance [38]. Many of these techniques involve a pipeline with multiple phases - face detection and alignment, feature extraction/landmark localization and classification as the final step. Other interesting approaches [7, 50, 36, 48] we should mention are based on temporal features [28, 51], and multiple kernels [29], action units [54, 40], as well as emotion recognition from speech [34, 39]. We will compare our method against some of those approaches in section 5.\nRecently, deep neural nets have been shown to perform well on classification tasks on images and videos, outperforming most traditional learning systems. One of the most interesting results was presented three years back on a large scale dataset (LSVRC 2011), where a deep convolutional net outperformed all other methods by far [25]. With advances in convolutional neural nets, we have seen neural nets applied to video classification [21, 46] and even facial expression recognition [1, 13] but these networks were not deep enough or used other feature extraction techniques like PCA or Fisherface.\nTraining a neural net normally requires a large labeled dataset which is hard to obtain using reasonable resources. Providing high quality results when only a small part of the data is labeled is an interesting problem referred to as semi-supervised learning. In [26] the authors pre-trained the system using pseudo labels, while in [52, 22] they embedded the data in a low dimensional space. Very recently superior results have been shown [30, 20, 18, 14, 19] using deep neural nets to combine labels and un-labeled data in the same package. In this paper we follow those guidelines and train from start-to-end a hybrid system composed\nof autoencoders for unlabeled data and additional loss function for the classification tasks."}, {"heading": "3. Method", "text": "We propose a semi-supervised approach using a deep neural network, by combining an autoencoder with a classification loss function, and training both of them in parallel. The input for the first layer is a short sequence of facial gestures composed of 9 frames cropped to 145 \u00d7 145 pixels window. The loss function is evaluated by combining a predictive loss from 7 different pre-labeled gestures (for the labeled part of the dataset), and autoencoder Euclidean loss for the entire (labeled and un-labeled) collection. The weights of each layer are dynamically altered such that the importance of the autoencoder loss decreases with relation to the predictive loss as the training progresses. While generating the data, we use Viola and Jones face detection [49] for cropping the faces. We use slow fusion based convolutional neural network with convolutions in both space and time (see figure 4 for a detailed overview)."}, {"heading": "3.1. Action autoencoder", "text": "Our action autoencoder consists of convolutional autoencoder for learning deep features and reducing the dimensionality of the data. We use convolutional filters with weight sharing in the first 6 layers followed by 2 fully connected layers. This network is similar to Imagenet [25] but accepts inputs of size 145 \u00d7 145 \u00d7 9 as an input. Using shorthand notation the full architecture can be written as C(96, 11, 3) \u2212 N \u2212 C(256, 5, 2) \u2212 N \u2212 C(384, 3, 2) \u2212 N \u2212 FC(4096) \u2212 FC(4096) \u2212 DC(96, 11, 3) \u2212 N \u2212 DC(256, 5, 2) \u2212 N \u2212 DC(384, 3, 2), where C(n, f, s) stands for convolution layers with n filters of size f and stride s. DC(n, f, s) stands for deconvolution layers with n deconvolving filters of size f and stride s. FC(n) stands for fully connected layers with n nodes and N stands for local response normalization layers. We extend the convo-\nlution layers in time and use slow fusion model [21] which slowly combines temporal information in successive layers. The first convolution filters have size 3 and stride 2 in time domain, the next layer has size 2 and stride 2 and the third layer combines all temporal features. The deconvolution layers are extended in time as well and reverse the slow fusion generating temporal features successively (see figure 3)."}, {"heading": "3.2. Multi-Velocity Encoders", "text": "One of the main challenges in action recognition is related to assigning similar classification to objects at different velocities. In this work we propose to learn the velocity of the sequence in parallel to its classification by adaptive temporal interpolation. Our multi-velocity autoencoder consists of 3 action autoencoders combined together to access temporal features for different velocities. We achieve this by adding a convolution layer as the first layer which uses cubic b-spline interpolation to slow down the video and generate intermediate frames. Piece-wise cubic b-spline interpolation is preferred over polynomial techniques as it can minimize interpolation error for fewer points and lower degree polynomials [16]. For initialization a sampling factor of 1, 2/3 and 1/3 is chosen, which is later refined as a part of the learning.\nNext we show how to generate the required weights for interpolation and encode them as a neural network layer. Cubic b-splines are continuous piecewise-polynomial functions containing polynomials of degree 3 or less. A cubic b-spline spanning n + 1 points comprises of n cubic polynomials ( Sn(x) N n=1 ) which can be uniquely defined using 4n coefficients. These coefficients can be recovered by ap-\nplying linear constraints arising from continuity and differentiability of the function on the break points (or knots). We represent input video at each pixel as a function of time and use cubic b-splines to approximate intermediate values. We represent intermediate polynomials between n+1 frames as a coefficient vector p\u0304 containing coefficients for all n polynomials.\nLet x\u0304, y\u0304 be the frame numbers and pixel values known to us at the different frames, these frames are obvious choices for break points as we try approximating space between frames using b-spline curves. Cubic b-spline coefficients p\u0304 for each pixel can be generated by solving a linear equation Ap\u0304 = Ty\u0304 as shown in the appendix. Here both A and T depend only on frame numbers (x\u0304) and are independent of pixel values (y\u0304) or pixel coordinates.\nLet uo be one of new points in time where we want to interpolate a video frame, we can compute it now by selecting kth consecutive frames containing uo, choosing piecewise polynomial contained in-between these frames (Sk(x)) and evaluating it at uo. We can write this as a dot product between coefficients and input r\u0304 \u00b7 p\u0304, where uo lies between kth consecutive frames and r\u0304 is as defined below in (1):\n\u00af[ri] = { ui\u22124ko if xbi/4c \u2264 uo \u2264 xbi/4c+1 0 o/w\n(1)\nExtending (1) to several temporal positions; Let u\u0304 = [ui] be locations in time where frames needs to be interpolated, we compute them as a matrix vector product Rp\u0304. Here each row of R = [rj,i] is computed using a shifted version of the\nequation given above, specifically:\n[rj,i] = { (uj \u2212 j)i\u22124k if xbi/4c < uj < xbi/4c+1 0 o/w (2)\nEquation (2) shows how interpolated pixel values F(u\u0304) are linearly related to b-spline coefficients Rp\u0304. Solving for p\u0304 using p\u0304 = A\u22121Ty\u0304 we infer that F(u\u0304) = RA\u22121Ty\u0304. The new velocity layer weights are initialized by computing matrix RA\u22121T which is independent of pixel values y\u0304 and their spatial locations. We can represent this matrix as a caffe convolution layer with shared weights, which contains n filters of size 1\u00d7 1\u00d7n applied to all frames of video. We use algorithm 1 to create 3 different weight matrices which interpolate sampling factors of 1, 2/3 and 1/3.\nAlgorithm 1 Generate convolution layer spline weights.

Semi-Supervised Learner", "text": "One of the main challenges we face today for training deep neural networks is the need for large labeled datasets. The richness of data is probably one of the main reasons why neural nets report such impressive predictive results in almost every field, but it is also extremely hard to collect and label such datasets. In Semi-supervised paradigm, we assume that only a part of the data is labeled, yet we wish to utilize the knowledge hidden within the entire set. Here we combine the action autoencoder convolution layers with a softmax loss function for the labeled set. The classifier neural net is inspired by Imagenet [25], with additional\nfully connected layers which are shared with the autoenoder, to generate deeper classification features from the latter. The full architecture of the predictor is C(96, 11, 3) \u2212 N \u2212C(256, 5, 2)\u2212N \u2212C(384, 3, 2)\u2212N \u2212FC(4096)\u2212 FC(8192) \u2212 FC(4096) \u2212 FC(512) \u2212 FC(8) with softmax layers in the end for label classification. Please refer to section 3.1 for explanation of the architecture shorthand.\nThe protocol we suggest for training the net is as important as the topology itself. We begin by training the autoencoder as a sole learner from the outer layer to the inner ones. Meaning, we adaptively add layers to the autoencoder, train the neural net, and use the produced weights as initialization for the next step. This is one of the traditional approaches used to train autoencoders [15, 5]. Next, we use the weights for initialization of the semi-supervised net, allowing the entire net to fine tune. A key factor in training is the learning rate of the two matched learners. We begin the training using a higher learning rate for the autoencoder (with predictor layers staying fixed using zero learning rate) and end the process with increased importance to the labeled loss function. While training on the labeled data, ratio between the two varies from a factor of 103 to a factor of 105 favoring the loss layer."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Multi-Velocity Semi-Supervised Learner", "text": "Finally we attach the new proposed Multi-Velocity layers as the first structure of the semi-supervised neural net. Each sub-structure (See Figure 4), has its own autoencoder, all of which are concatenated after the inner most convolution layer into a feature vector (size 12288), later used by the labeled loss function. The learner loss function can be expressed as a weighted sum of autoencoder and predictor loss given in equation 3 below.\nL = \u03b1 \u2211 v ||x\u0304\u2212 x\u0304v|| \u2212 \u03b2 \u2211 j yj log ( eoj\u2211 k e ok ) (3)\nHere x\u0304, x\u0304v are autoencoder inputs and outputs, yj are the input labels and oj is the outputs from predictor layer.\u2211\nv ||x\u0304\u2212 x\u0304v|| is the combined Euclidean loss across three multi-velocity encoders and \u2212 \u2211 j yj log ( eoj\u2211 k e ok ) is softmax loss [4]. While training using labeled data, the loss coefficient \u03b2 is selected to keep softmax loss an order of magnitude higher than the Euclidean loss. Loss coefficient \u03b1 is adjusted as softmax loss goes down to continue training predictor layers, without overfitting autoencoder layers. Notice that we use two coefficients for the energy function and not just controlling the ratio between the two since the back-propagation algorithm has its own additional parameters."}, {"heading": "4.

Here we collected 6.5 million video clips containing 25 frames each, adding up to more than 162 million face images. We used viola-jones face detector to find and segment out the faces. Next, we localized landmarks for each frame using a deformable model for the face [3] and detected the facial pose by fitting a 3D model to the landmarks. This process allowed us to restrict the dataset to videos which contain faces tilted less than 30 degrees and remove any faces looking sideways.\nIn order to extract only meaningful video clips we re-\nmoved clips with static gestures or those where the faces were rapidly altering, either due to some high speed movement or simply due to appearance of a different face. We achieved this by blurring the clips and calculating the difference between consecutive frames.\nThe raw videos were taken from public sources such as CNN, MSNBC, FOX and CSPAN.

Discussion and Future Work", "text": "This paper presents a learning strategy for large datasets with a dramatically lower number of labeled points, in addition to new layers carefully designed to improve recognition in multi-velocity setup. We currently trim the videos to the facial window using Viola and Jones face detection, and focus solely on frontal views. Recognition in-the-wild still remains a challenge with a known low success rate. We believe that given a large and rich dataset this problem would be feasible to solve in our system, and we plan to explore that in the future.\nWe introduced a new layer, which adaptively resamples the videos, achieving a multi-velocity invariant learning procedure. Inserting invariants into a learning process is a research direction that we must push forward. Today training of deep neural network is still time consuming, where huge clusters are being heavily used on reasonably\nlarge datasets. We are already reaching the time-space limit of this process, and better/smarter approaches need to be considered for advancement. Our multi-velocity setup is one approach for reducing the need for data in multiple velocities, while other invariants should be explored in future work."}, {"heading": "7.
