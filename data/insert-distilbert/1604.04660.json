AI systems interact with \u201cenvironments\u201d that contain all relevant existing objects and the rules by which they interact, while \u201ctasks\u201d assigned to an agent describe (un)desirable environment states that should be brought about or avoided. We refer to the tuple of a task and the environment in which it must be accomplished as the \u201ctask-environment\u201d. Specialized AI systems are often made with a single task in mind, while systems aspiring to artificial general intelligence (AGI) aim to tackle a wide range of tasks that are largely unknown at design time. Tasks can be divided in various ways into different sets of subtasks, and intelligent systems must make a choice about what tasks to pursue. Finally, tasks are used for the evaluation and training of these systems. So while the concept of \u201ctask\u201d is at the very\ncore of AI, no general theory exists about their properties.1 Tasks are generally selected on an ad-hoc, case-by-case basis without any deep understanding of their fundamental properties or how different tasks relate to each other.\nThis is very different in many other fields. When for instance a new airplane needs to be designed to perform a certain family of tasks (say, move 300 passengers across the Atlantic within 8 hours) aeronautics engineers employ theories firmly rooted in physics to turn task parameters into (preliminary) requirements for the design of that airplane. They evaluate the design by running simulations, where parameters of the task and environment \u2014 air pressure, wind speed, turbulence, humidity, precipitation, runway length, travel distance, etc. \u2014 are changed to see their effect on the artifact\u2019s behavior. When an engineer changes an environmental variable (e.g. wind speed) or feature of the task (e.g. descent angle), its meaning is well understood in the context of an airplane\u2019s task-environment, which allows its resulting behavior to be readily understood. Evaluating the performance of complex systems usually involves the use of a battery of such tests, each of which may be composed of a small or large set of atomic tasks. The thoroughness of evaluation depends on the diversity of the tests employed, chosen to provide a comprehensive picture of the system\u2019s behavior, in their \u201ccomfort zone\u201d as well as at the fringes of their target operating ranges. Finally, when the airplane is in use, decisions regarding its deployment are informed by its physical properties and the task specification (e.g. weather, range and cargo for a planned flight).\nIn the absence of such theories for AI, people sometimes attempt to use theories from other domains. Extensive domain knowledge is often used in the design of (narrow) AI systems, but even here it is often a challenge to select the best machine learning techniques, gather the right knowledge, and optimize the system\u2019s performance. Experience in other domains tends to be unhelpful as different tasks cannot be compared or related to each other. Many researchers have turned to theories of human psychology and psychometrics to evaluate AI systems, resulting in human-centric tests (e.g. the Turing Test, the Lovelace Tests, the Toy Box Problem, the Piaget-MacGuyver Room, and AGI Preschool \u2014 see also the latest special issue of AI Magazine [9]). Many of these tests are limited to providing a binary (and to this day universally negative) answer to the question of whether a system is truly intelligent.\nThe range of possible AI systems and their capabilities is quite a bit greater than that of animals: Humans can\u2019t systematically reduce the size of their semantic memory, say, or replace their motor control scheme in an instant. Similarly, the range of tasks that AI systems might encounter is much greater than that of airplanes. AGI systems explicitly target diversity and complexity, aiming for a broad range of behaviors on a large set of complex tasks in a number of diverse environments. The range of evaluation tools the field has in its toolkit should reflect this breadth.\nSome evaluation methods have been proposed that cover a wider range of tasks, but they are either still too specific \u2014 e.g. general (video) game playing of a handful of\n1 Classical planning has hierarchical task networks [4], but subtask decomposition is almost always done manually and there is no real analysis of tasks on a general level. Some people working on AI evaluation \u2014 one of task theory\u2019s primary applications \u2014 attempt to analyze some properties of task-environments, but they don\u2019t go beyond complexity and difficultyrelated measures [6].\nmanually created games [3,8] \u2014 or they are so abstract that it is difficult to relate them to tasks in the real world \u2014 e.g. procedural generation of almost completely random tasks [2,7].2 To adequately evaluate AGI-aspiring systems, rigorous tests profiling cognitive abilities such as transfer of training, knowledge retention, attentional control, and knowledge acquisition rate, would be highly valuable [11]. A deep and general understanding of tasks and the ability to construct and compare related tasks would greatly facilitate the design of an evaluation tool with these capabilities.\nIdeally we would have good theories for all aspects of intelligence/competence/skills assessment, analysis and development. No classification scheme or architectural principles exist at present that seem likely to provide a unifying framework for research on (artificial) intelligences, and no such framework seems likely to spring forward in the near future, as researchers in the field don\u2019t even agree on which aspects are necessary components for a system to be called intelligent. A formal approach to tasks and environments can, however, begin to be undertaken, as they offer readily measurable physical features. Such a theory could take many forms, but rather than rooting it in computer science, the early results of the field of AI, or in human task analysis [10], we think it important to develop a task theory grounded in the physical realm.\nNote that we are not targeting a theory of learning, a theory of agents, or a theory of evaluation \u2014 quite the contrary, we want to focus exclusively on the task-environment so as not to mix these; this may include the agent\u2019s body, but not its controller (\u201cmind\u201d). Otherwise we run the risk of continuing the conflation of the learner with its task and environment. (This aim, however, highlights the need for a proper theory of learning, agents and pedagogy \u2014 these are not mutually exclusive but in fact ultimately necessary for achieving comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of learners in a wide range of circumstances.) Note also that we are not proposing to represent all tasks and environments accurately or in every detail, but rather to develop a task-environment representation that suffices for modeling a wide range of (the most important aspects of) these, in a way amenable for simulation, and possibly analytical computation.\nIn the rest of this paper we look at the requirements for a task theory of this kind, its potential applications, and outline some examples for what it might look like as a way to further clarify our intent and provide a case for its potential.\n2 What We Might Want From a Task Theory\nThree important aspects of AI research include its evaluation, pedagogy (training/learning), and design. An AI system is designed for a particular role, involving performing a task or range of tasks. Tasks are also at the core of their pedagogy and evaluation. A properly conceived task theory could help with all these aspects of AI research.\nEvaluation Evaluation of AI systems allows researchers to find the strengths and weaknesses of their creations and measure progress through comparisons with earlier versions and other systems. Evaluation of general intelligence is complicated by the facts\n2 More discussion of various evaluation methods can be found in our previous publication [11].\nthat 1) no fully functional AGI systems exist to date, 2) different systems have different non-overlapping capabilities, and 3) tests must measure (progress towards) some general cognitive ability rather than performance on a specialized task [5].\nWhen an agent, whether artificial or natural, is assigned a task, three things may be in flux: (a) The task \u2014 which prescribes what goals should be achieved and/or what situations should be avoided, (b) the environment in which the task is performed \u2014 which may act independently of the agent, and (c) the agent itself \u2014 whose perception, memory, goal structures, and other cognitive features are affected by the task and environment. To analyze the effects of changes in one element of an interacting system, variation in the others must typically be controlled to prevent contamination of results. To quantify the performance of a system, or compare any set of systems, the task and the environment must be held constant, otherwise what is measured cannot be reliably attributed to the agent\u2019s performance. This would suggest that AI systems can only be compared if they are evaluated on the same task-environments. AI researchers would need to settle on a standardized set of tests to be administered (unmodified!) to all AI systems that we want to compare. However, it is unreasonable to assume that all of these systems will be, or even can be, tested on exactly the same task(s). This would require a test that (a) can be used for all AI systems and (b) is discriminatory between all pairs compared \u2014 clearly an impossibility. Even if the whole field settled on a standardized test battery today, it would likely become obsolete as AI systems evolve, as well as fall victim to specialists on the test: the very antithesis of AGI. We must accept that different systems are, and will continue to be, developed with different philosophies in mind, as this is how research is done. Until we have systems with full generality (but possibly not even then) we need methods for evaluating intermediate milestones on different paths towards AGI. Given results from two different AGI-aspiring systems on two different tasks, we could compare them if we had a way of relating the tasks to each other on (some or all) key dimensions. This is precisely what a task theory would enable, thus removing the need for a standardized test battery applicable to all AI systems. All systems \u2014 no matter how simple or advanced \u2014 could be evaluated in their \u201cnatural habitat\u201d and still be compared to each other, the quality of which would be determined in part by the power of the theory.\nWe\u2019ve argued before that a good A(G)I evaluation framework should enable the easy manual and automatic construction of task-environments and their variants as well as facilitate the analysis of parameters of interest [11]. A task theory should similarly allow us to relate the features of a task to measurable physical and/or conceptual aspects, enabling comparison of similar and dissimilar tasks, and facilitate the construction of task-environments and variations on known tasks without changing their nature, so that we may select or design tasks capable of measuring various aspects of AIs.We would like to be able to compose and decompose tasks and environments, and scale them up or down in size or complexity in accordance with robust and well-understood principles. In order to provide a characterization of task-environments, measures ought to be defined for properties like determinism, ergodicity, continuity, asynchronicity, dynamism, observability, controllability,periodicity, and repeatability [11].\nPedagogy Learning systems must be trained for the task(s) that they are created for. In some (simple) cases such systems may be able to learn everything on their own, but\neven when teaching isn\u2019t strictly necessary it can improve the training, e.g. by speeding it up [1]. Teaching is done interactively using various forms of communication, demonstration and/or by assigning carefully selected or constructed tasks to the student system so that it may learn the relevant knowledge and skills faster \u2014 e.g. teaching simplified versions of a task\u2019s component parts before teaching the whole. Task theory should help in the construction of appropriate training scenarios and task features. A deeper understanding of tasks would also enable systematic use of analogies and abstraction that can be explained to a student system.\nDesign A task theory could also help alleviate some of the trial-and-error involved in designing AI systems for a particular set of tasks or task types. Currently designers build up informal, difficult to verbalize experience and intuition for matching certain system features with their understanding of the task at hand. A task theory would allow for systematic characterization and comparison of different tasks, and thus take out some or significant parts of that guesswork. While full-fledged testing and evaluation will remain a necessity, the ability to e.g. predict time and resource use for a task would create a rapid feedback loop for designing the AI\u2019s body \u2014 and if combined with a theory of learning systems, also its controller."}, {"heading": "3 Requirements for a Task Theory", "text": "A task theory should cover all aspects of tasks and the environments in which they must be executed; in short, it should enable us to model tasks in a way that supports:\n1. Comparison of similar and dissimilar tasks. 2. Abstraction and concretization of (composite) tasks and task elements. 3. Estimation of time, energy, cost of errors, and other resource requirements (and\nyields) for task completion. 4. Characterization of task complexity in terms of (emergent) quantitative measures\nlike observability, feedback latency, form and nature of information/instruction provided to a performer, etc.\n5. Decomposition of tasks into subtasks and their atomic elements. 6. Construction of new tasks based on combination, variation and specifications.\nThese requirements should enable the applications mentioned in the last section. A computational task theory would provide a foundation for frameworks/toolkits that can simulate a wide variety of tasks in the form of task models constructed according to the theory, automatically produce variants of tasks over some desirable distributions, and run evaluation tests in batch mode to provide a vast amount of performance data for any set of controllers and AI systems. Estimation of time, energy and other resource requirements (and yields) for task completion can be used to design effective and efficient agent bodies, judge an agent based on comparative performance, and make a cost-benefit analysis for deciding what (sub)tasks to pursue. The models constructed according to this theory are used to estimate the AI\u2019s ability to perform real life tasks if\nprovided with the actuators and sensors contained within the model.3 The performance of the AI can be described by the energy as a function of time and the precision at which the task was completed, where the highest possible attainable precision is defined by the laws of physics.\nPerforming a task in the real world requires time, energy and possibly other resources such as money, materials, or manpower. Omitting these variables from the task model is tantamount to making the untenable assumption that these resources are infinite [12]. Any action, perception and deliberation must take up at least some time and energy. Therefore every task that we model must have these components.\nCharacterization of tasks can facilitate their comparison at a high level, enabling us to contextualize the performance of different systems on different tasks. It would also allow us to correlate these quantitative measures with the performance of a particular agent in order to seek out tasks that are more suitable to it (e.g. for evaluation or teaching). Decomposition, abstraction and comparison all facilitate a deeper understanding of task-environments that could potentially be communicated to a student. Comparison of tasks in terms of e.g. environment contents and structure, can have similar benefits to comparison in terms of high-level measures, but additionally help with analogical reasoning and transfer of knowledge.\nImportantly, these features would facilitate the construction of new tasks: they provide building blocks (decomposition), information about fundamental features to keep (abstraction) and a way to ensure a certain amount of similarity (comparison). Task theory should allow for the construction of variants of tasks with differing levels of similarity, and even support generation according to a high level specification of the characteristics under item 4. Such constructions would allow for tailor-made training environments and evaluation tools that support a wide range of systems."}, {"heading": "4 What a Task Theory Might Look Like", "text": "Completion of a fully-fledged task theory that meets all of our requirements is a rather large endeavor that has only just begun, and the requirements a task theory as described above can likely be met in a variety of ways. To make more tangible our aims with this work we outline now ideas for a concrete direction we are exploring for physical tasks, as a way to both ground the preceding discussion and provide some potential demonstrations of its feasibility. For this purpose we simulate a fully specified task model, allowing precise analysis. Producing definitions of key concepts compatible with physics is important to us, as we are looking for a theory that allows engineering of task-environments with measurable physical properties.\nEstimating the time and energy requirements of a compound task precisely for an arbitrary agent is tricky: We cannot simply expect that the agent will immediately pick an optimal action sequence to complete the task using the minimum amount of time or energy (different strategies may result in the optimization of time vs. energy). One approach would be to map out spaces of solutions and all possible action sequences. The ratio of these two will tell us the potential of a controller to fail the task \u2014 more\n3 Recall that a task theory would include the limitations that the body of an agent imposes \u2014 its interface to the task-environment.\nformally, the probability of its successful completion of a random performer. Having a number of dimensions for which to measure this ratio, including constraints of time, energy, and other factors, would mean that tasks could be profiled and positioned in a multidimensional manifold. By grounding such measures in absolute physical terms, distances between any two tasks would represent real physical measurements and tell us a lot about how the solution spaces for them compare.\nWhen done naively, mapping out the entire space of possible action sequences is only feasible for very small tasks. However, for compound tasks we could combine those small tasks in various ways to get larger tasks whose properties we can estimate (e.g. serial composition multiplies the ratios). Alternatively, decomposition could be applied until the component parts resemble tasks whose properties we can calculate.\nIn order to make any calculations or analysis however, we need a more concrete idea of fundamental concepts like environment, state, agent, goal, problem, and task. These concepts must be defined in a way to facilitate (modular) construction and analysis while preferably not straying too far from their intuitive notions.\nEnvironment The highest level in our conceptualization of task-environments is a world W , which is an interactive system consisting of a set of variables V , dynamics functions F , an initial state S0, domains D of possible values for those variables, and a possibly empty set of invariant relations between the variablesR: W = \u3008V, F, S0, D,R\u3009. The variables V = { v1, v2, . . . , v\u2016V \u2016 }\nrepresent all the things that may change or hold a particular value in the world. A system\u2019s dynamics can intuitively be thought of as its \u201claws of nature\u201d. As a whole, the dynamics may be viewed as an automatically executed function that periodically or continually transforms the world\u2019s current state into the next: St+\u03b4 = F(St). However, in practice it is often useful to decompose the dynamics into a set of transition functions: F = {f1, f2 . . . fn} where fi : S\u2212 \u2192 S\u2212 and S\u2212 is a partially specified state.\nEach variable v may take on any value from the associated domain dv \u2208 D. For physical domains we can take the domain of each variable to be a subset of the real numbers. Invariant relations R are Boolean functions over variables that hold true in any state that the system will ever find itself in. In a closed system (with no outside influences) the domains and invariant relations are implicitly fully determined by F and S0. In an open system \u2014 where change may be caused externally \u2014 explicit definition of domains and relations can be used to restrict the range of possible interactions.\nEnvironments are views or perspectives on the world. In their simplest form they can be characterized as slices or subspaces of the world, where all variables can take on a subset of the world\u2019s variables, each variable\u2019s domain is a subset of that variable\u2019s domain in the world, and only the relevant dynamics and invariants are inherited. Environments can be defined for different purposes (e.g. for different tasks or agents), and their overlap and similarities can be analyzed. A task-environment should include all aspects of the world that are relevant to the completion of the task.\nState A concrete state S is a value assignment to all variables of a system: S = \u22c3\nv\u2208V {\u3008v, xv | xv \u2208 dv\u3009}. A state is valid if and only if all relations hold true: valid(S) \u21d0\u21d2 \u2200r\u2208Rr(S). A partial state S\u2212 only assigns concrete values to a subset\nof the variables in a system. For real variables partial states can be represented by using error bounds: S\u2212 = \u22c3\nv\u2208V \u2212 {\u3008v, xl, xu | xl < xu \u2227 (xl, xu) \u2286 dv\u3009}. As such, a partial state really covers a set of concrete states. This concept is more practical, since it is rare that we precisely know or care about the value of every last variable: in most cases only a subset matters, and noise and partial observability make it impossible to know most values with absolute precision.\nAgent An agent A is an embodied system consisting of a controller C (the AI system) and a body B. The body is the agent\u2019s interface to the world and communicates signals from sensors to the controller, which in turn sends back commands to be turned into atomic actions by the body\u2019s actuators. The internals of the controller are beyond the scope of a physical task theory, and since any physical system is naturally embedded in the world, the body merely contains two lists of environment variables that the controller can directly read from and write to: B = \u3008VS , VA\u3009. In other words: all sensors and actuators must be (physical) objects in the world.\nProblem & Goal A goal state g is a desirable (partial) state that the agent should reach. A failure state g is an undesirable (partial) state that the agent should avoid. An atomic problem is specified by an initial state, goal states and failure states. Compound problems can be created by operations like conjunction, disjunction and negation. A solution is a sequence of (atomic) actions that results in a path through the state space that reaches all of the goal states and none of the failure states. A problem for which a solution is known to exist is called a closed problem.\nTask Finally, a task is a problem assigned to an agent. This assignment includes the manner in which the task/problem is communicated to the agent \u2014 e.g. whether the agent gets a description of the task a priori (as in AI planning), receives additional hints, or only gets incremental reinforcement as certain states are reached. A task is performed successfully once the world\u2019s history contains a path that solved the problem.\nWe could additionally attach utility functions to problems to measure the degree of success \u2014 rather than just success / failure / in progress \u2014 but we could also emulate this by assigning the agent multiple simultaneous tasks and the meta-goal of performing as many as possible. For instance, if a task is considered successful when a certain (partial) state is reached before time t = 2, but it\u2019s even more desirable to do it in less time, then we could assign an additional task that only succeeds if the goal is reached before time t = 1.\nTwo kinds of tasks are typically identified (cf. [13]): what might be called achievement tasks (e.g. \u201censure X \u2248 GX or X 6\u2248 GX before time t \u2265 5\u201d) and maintenance tasks (e.g. \u201cmaintain X \u2248 GX or X 6\u2248 GX until t = 10),4 where X \u2208 V and GX \u2208 dX . Combinations are possible (\u201censure X \u2248 GX between time t = 5 and t = 10\u201d). Performing a task in the real world requires time, energy, and possibly other\n4 We use approximate rather than precise equivalence between X and its goal value GX because we intend for our theory to describe real-world task-environments, which always must come with error bounds.\nresources (money, materials, manpower). But taking physical constraints into account makes it clear that any goal state must be held (maintained) for a non-zero duration (at a minimum sufficiently long for the achievement to be detected). What seems like two kinds of tasks is thus actually just one kind of goal with particular parameter settings (an accomplishment goal is simply a goal whose state may be held for a short period of time, relative to the time it takes to perform the task which it is part of \u2014 a maintenance goal is held for relatively longer periods of time). The highest attainable precision of a goal state is defined by the laws of physics and the resolution of sensors and actuators.\nFor any human-level task in the physical world, even seemingly simple ones such as doing the dishes or going to the store to buy bread, V and F will generally be quite large.\nExample Consider as an example a simplified driving task modeled in task theory. The agent must drive over a frictionless surface towards a target that is some distance away by using the gas pedal to control the power (i.e. the rate at which fuel is burned). The world might be initialized to S0 = {\u3008time, 0\u3009, \u3008energy, 10\u3009, \u3008position, 2\u3009, \u3008velocity, 0\u3009, \u3008power, 0\u3009, \u3008mass, 2\u3009}. The goal could be g = {\u3008position, > 10\u3009, \u3008time, < 5\u3009, \u3008energy, > 0\u3009}: every realistic task should have a deadline and energy budget. The dynamics are defined by using basic Newtonian physics: \u2018time \u2190 time + \u03b4\u2019, \u2018energy \u2190 energy \u2212 \u03b4 \u00b7 power\u2019, \u2018position \u2190 max(0, position + \u03b4 \u00b7 velocity)\u2019, and \u2018velocity \u2190 \u221a\n2\u03b4\u00b7power mass + velocity 2\u2019. The body might simply be defined by\nB = \u3008{position}, {power}\u3009, meaning that the agent can observe the position and control the force. From the dynamics and initial values we can tell for instance that the time and position will never be negative. However, since the force can be externally controlled, we need to specify its domain: dpower = [0, 10]. The agent can solve the task in many ways, but the fastest is to use maximum power (this takes 2.863 seconds, but energy runs out after 1). We could perform a different analysis for optimal energy usage (e.g. using 0.15 Joule/second solves the task in 9.865 seconds, leaving 8.52 Joules).\nMore complex variants of this simple task can be made with some slight adjustments. Tasks from the same family are similar in nature and share many fundamental properties; they can be closely related, e.g. if they only (slightly) differ in their initial states or allocated resource budget, and more distantly if few features are shared, such as tennis and football. Allowing the agent to choose which direction to move in, for example, increases the chance of the agent missing the target. Adding friction, wind, obstacles and hills will increase the complexity of the original task without changing the nature of the model itself. Another important way to make variations is by changing the resolution, noise and latency of sensors and actuators. The task can also easily be extended by adding clauses to the goal (e.g. require that velocity becomes 0), adding more goals (e.g. to move back to the start), or by adding a second dimension."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "We have argued for the importance of a task theory for various aspects of AI research, highlighting system design, pedagogy, and evaluation.

In other fields of engineering theoretical foundations allow thorough evaluation of designs by methodical manipulation of well understood parameters with a known role and importance; this allows an aeronautics engineer, for instance, to systematically assess the effects of wind speed on an airplane\u2019s performance and stability. No framework exists in AI that allows this kind of methodical manipulation: Performance results on the few tasks in current use (cf. board games, question-answering) cannot be easily compared, however similar or different. The issue is even more acute with respect to artificial general intelligence systems, which must handle unanticipated tasks whose specifics cannot be known beforehand. A task theory would enable addressing tasks at the class level, bypassing their specifics, providing the appropriate formalization and classification of tasks, environments, and their parameters, resulting in more rigorous ways of measuring, comparing, and evaluating intelligent behavior. Even modest improvements in this direction would surpass the current ad-hoc nature of machine learning and AI evaluation. Here we discuss the main elements of the argument for a task theory and present an outline of what it might look like for physical tasks.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software"}}}
