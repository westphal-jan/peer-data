Introduction", "text": "A multi-armed bandit problem is a crystallized instance of a sequential decision-making problem in an uncertain environment, and it can model many real-world scenarios. This problem involves conceptual entities called arms. At each round, the forecaster draws one of the K arms and receives a corresponding reward feedback. The aim of the forecaster is to maximize the cumulative reward over rounds, which is achieved by running an algorithm that balances the exploration (acquisition of information) and the exploitation (utilization of information). In evaluating the performance of a bandit algorithm, a metric called regret, which mea-\nsures how much the algorithm explores, is widely used.\nWhile it is desirable to obtain rewards as direct feedback from an arm, in a number of practical cases such direct feedback is not available. In this paper, we consider a version of the standard stochastic bandit problem called the K-armed dueling bandit problem (Yue et al., 2009), in which the forecaster receives relative feedback, which specifies which of the two arms is preferred. Although the original motivation of the dueling bandit problem arose in the field of information retrieval, learning under relative feedback is universal to many fields, such as recommender systems (Gemmis et al., 2009), graphical design (Brochu et al., 2010), and natural language processing (Zaidan & Callison-Burch, 2011), which involve explicit or implicit feedback provided by humans.\nIn the standard bandit problem, the best arm is naturally defined as the one with the largest expected reward. However, if the feedback is restricted to the results of pairwise comparisons, there are several possible ways to define the best arm. Following the literature on the dueling bandit problem, we call the best arm the winner. When there exists an arm that beats (i.e., preferred in expectation) all the other arms, it is natural to define it as the winner; this notion is called a Condorcet winner. Unfortunately, the Condorcet winner does not always exist. Still, we can define an extended notion of the Condorcet winner that always exists as follows. Let the Copeland winners be the arms that beat the greatest number of other arms. In this paper, we study the difficulty of finding the Copeland winners from pairwise feedback."}, {"heading": "1.1. Related work", "text": "Early algorithms for solving the dueling bandit problem, such as Interleaved Filter (Yue et al., 2012) and Beat the Mean Bandit (Yue & Joachims, 2011), require the arms to\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n01 67\n7v 2\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n2 4\nM ay\nbe totally ordered.\nUrvoy et al. (2013) considered a large class of sequential learning problems that includes the dueling bandit problem and introduced the notion of Condorcet, Copeland, and Borda dueling bandit problems. Several algorithms, such as Relative Upper Confidence Bound (RUCB) (Zoghi et al., 2014), and Relative Minimum Empirical Divergence (RMED) (Komiyama et al., 2015a), have since been proposed that effectively solve the Condorcet dueling bandit problem. The assumption on the Condorcet winner partly relaxes the assumption of the total order because it admits circular preferences that involve non-winners.\nHowever, as the Condorcet winner does not always exist, the result of running one of these algorithms is unpredictable if it is applied to an instance without a Condorcet winner. Consequently, the practical applicability of Condorcet dueling bandit algorithms is limited. Some papers have discussed the problem of preference elicitation without a Condorcet winner (Jamieson et al., 2015; Zoghi et al., 2015a) and have motivated studies of more general dueling bandit problems. Unlike the Condorcet winner, the Borda and Copeland winners always exist. Note that there are also other notions of winners, such as the von Neumann winner (Dud\u0131\u0301k et al., 2015) or Random walk winner (Altman & Tennenholtz, 2008) together with their corresponding dueling bandit problems. Among them, we will consider the Copeland dueling bandit problem. Unlike the Borda or Random Walk winners, the Copeland winners are compatible with the Condorcet winner; if the Condorcet winner exists, it is also the Copeland winner. An algorithm for finding the Copeland winner (i) covers the application range of the Condorcet winner and (ii) can find arms that beat other arms the most, even if the Condorcet winner does not exist.\nAnother line of study is on the partial monitoring problem (Barto\u0301k et al., 2014). The partial monitoring is general enough to cover the multi-armed bandit. Some classes of dueling bandit problems, such as utility-based ones (Gajane & Urvoy, 2015), can also be formalized as a partial monitoring. However, it is unknown as to whether the Copeland dueling bandit problem can be effectively represented as a partial monitoring or not. Moreover, existing algorithms for partial monitoring, such as Bayes-update Partial Monitoring (BPM) (Vanchinathan et al., 2014) or Partial Monitoring Deterministic Minimum Empirical Divergence (PMDMED) (Komiyama et al., 2015b), are not very scalable to the number of actions.\nExisting results on the Copeland dueling bandit problem: The difficulty of the dueling bandit problem lies in that there are O(K2) pairs. There are some algorithms, such as Sensitivity Analysis of VAriables for Generic Exploration (SAVAGE) (Urvoy et al., 2013), Preference-based Racing (PBR) (Busa-Fekete et al., 2013), and Rank Elicita-\ntion (RankEI) (Busa-Fekete et al., 2014), that can deal with general classes of problems that entail solving Copeland dueling bandit problems. The price to pay for such generality is performance: all three algorithms have O(K2 log T ) regret because they naively compare all pairs O(log T ) times.\nThe recently proposed Copeland Confidence Bound (CCB) (Zoghi et al., 2015a) exploits the structure of the Copeland dueling bandit problem and is relatively efficient. It has an asymptotic regret of O(K(C+L1+1)\u22062 log T ) (Theorem 3 in Zoghi et al. 2015a), where C is the number of Copeland winners, L1 is the number of arms that beats the Copeland winner, and \u2206 is related to how hard it is to determine whether each arm i beats arm j or not. In this paper, we further push our understanding of the dueling bandit problem by deriving an asymptotically optimal regret bound. The optimal bound states that (i) the dependency on C can be completely removed; (ii) the dependency on L1 is necessary for some cases but unnecessary for typical cases explained later, and (iii) the dependency on \u2206 can be relaxed by introducing a divergence-based bound. In an information retrieval example, the optimal bound improves the one of the CCB by several orders of magnitude (Table 1).\nContributions: The main contributions of this paper are summarized in the following four aspects: First, we derive an asymptotic regret lower bound (Section 3). The lower bound is based on the minimum amount of exploration for identifying a Copeland winner. Second, we propose the Copeland Winners Relative Minimum Empirical Divergence (CW-RMED) algorithm. CW-RMED is the first algorithm whose performance asymptotically matches the regret lower bound (Section 4.1). Unfortunately, a naive implementation of CW-RMED is computationally prohibitive. Third, we propose Efficient Copeland Winners RMED (ECW-RMED), another algorithm that addresses the above computational issue (Section 4.2). An efficient way to implement it is proposed. Moreover, we show that the regret of ECW-RMED is very close to optimal. Finally, we implemented ECW-RMED and compared its performance with those of existing algorithms (Section 5). ECW-\nRMED significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms on many datasets. In a ranker evaluation example, its regret was smaller than one third of those of the others."}, {"heading": "2. Problem Setup", "text": "TheK-armed dueling bandit problem involvesK arms that are indexed as [K] := {1, 2, . . . ,K}. Let M \u2208 RK\u00d7K be a preference matrix whose ij entry \u00b5i,j corresponds to the probability that arm i is preferred to arm j. At each round t = 1, 2, . . . , T , the forecaster draws a pair of arms p(t) = (l(t),m(t)) \u2208 [K]2 and, receives relative feedback X\u0302l(t),m(t)(t) \u223c Bernoulli(\u00b5l(t),m(t)) that indicates which of (l(t),m(t)) is preferred. We say arm i beats arm j if \u00b5i,j > 1/2. By definition, \u00b5i,j = 1 \u2212 \u00b5j,i holds for any i, j \u2208 [K] and \u00b5i,i = 1/2. Throughout this paper, we assume \u00b5i,j 6= 1/2 for i 6= j. Let Pi 6=j := {(i, j) : i, j \u2208 [K], i > j} and Pall := {(i, j) : i, j \u2208 [K], i \u2265 j}. A comparison of pair (i, j) is identified with that of pair (j, i).\nLet Ni,j(t) be the number of comparisons of pair (i, j) and \u00b5\u0302i,j(t) be the empirical estimate of \u00b5i,j at round t. For j 6= i, let Ni>j(t) be the number of times i is preferred over j. Accordingly, \u00b5\u0302i,j(t) = Ni>j(t)/Ni,j(t), where we set 0/0 = 1/2 here.\nLet the superiors of arm i be Si := {j : j \u2208 [K], \u00b5i,j < 1/2}, that is, the set of arms that beat arm i. Let Li := |Si| and C = |{i \u2208 [K] : Li = minj Lj}|. Without loss of generality, we can assume L1 = L2 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = LC \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 LK . Of course, algorithms should not exploit this ordering. Arms [C] are called Copeland winners. Note that the Copeland winners always exist, but are not necessarily unique. Let the inferiors of arm i be Ii := {j : j \u2208 [K], \u00b5i,j > 1/2}. Assuming that \u00b5i,j 6= 1/2 for i 6= j, each arm j is either a superior or an inferior of arm i. When L1 = 0, the Copeland winner is unique and also called a Condorcet winner.\nWe define the regret per round1 is ri,j := (Li + Lj \u2212 2L1)/(2(K \u2212 1)) \u2264 1 when the pair (i, j) is compared and the regret as R(T ) := \u2211 t\u2208[T ] rl(t),m(t). The regret increases at each round unless both l(t) and m(t) are Copeland winners. This definition is reasonable because we have defined the goodness of an arm by the number of arms that i beats (Copeland number) and are interested in drawing the best arms. The choice of l(t) = m(t) is possible, but yields no useful information since, by definition, \u00b5i,i = 1/2 for any arm i.\nNote that, we can also consider other definitions of regret; the analysis in this paper is relied on the facts that regret per round ri,j is (i) finite, (ii) determined by the Copeland\n1The constant factor of this definition is different from the one defined in Zoghi et al. (2015a). Our result can be compared with that of Zoghi et al. (2015a) simply by multiplying a constant.\nnumbers, (iii) and equal to zero if i and j are Copeland winners. For example, we can consider a regret such that ri,j = 0 if i, j \u2208 [C] and 1 otherwise, and easily modify our result in accordance with that definition."}, {"heading": "3. Regret Lower Bound", "text": "In this section, we derive an asymptotic regret lower bound when T \u2192 \u221e. In the context of the standard multi-armed bandit problem, Lai & Robbins (1985) derived the regret lower bound of strongly consistent algorithms; intuitively, a strongly consistent algorithm is \u201cuniformly good\u201d in the sense that it works well with any set of model parameters. We extend this result to the Copeland dueling bandit problem.\nWe first define notions that are important in characterizing the regret lower bound: the subsets of the power set of the superiors and the inferiors with a fixed size. Let Smi := {S \u2208 2Si : |S| = m}, Imi := {I \u2208 2Ii : |I| = m}, and S\\j,mi := {S \u2208 2Si\\{j} : |S| = m}. Moreover, let MCop be a set of all preference matrices of size K \u00d7 K. A Copeland dueling bandit algorithm is strongly consistent if it satisfies E[R(T )] = o(T a) for any a > 0 given any preference matrix M \u2208 MCop. Essentially, a strongly consistent algorithm needs to find one of the Copeland winners with a high confidence level. To make sure that arm i\u2217 is a Copeland winner, we need to simultaneously find (i) an upper-bound Li\u2217 of a Copeland winner i\u2217 and (ii) a lower-bound Lj of the other arms. The minimum amount of exploration in Copeland dueling bandit is characterized in this way. The following lemma formalizes the aforementioned statement.\nLemma 1. (Lower bound on the number of draws) Let dKL(p, q) := p log p/q+(1\u2212p) log (1\u2212 p)/(1\u2212 q) be the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between two Bernoulli distributions with parameters p, q. For any strongly consistent algorithm, the following inequality holds for at least one i1 \u2208 [C]:\n\u2200i2 6=i1 \u2200l \u2208 {max{0, L1 \u2212 1}, . . . , L2}\n\u2200I \u2208 Il+1\u2212Li1i1 \u2200S \u2208 S \\i1,max{0,Li2\u2212l\u22121{i2\u2208I}} i2\u2211\n(i,j)\u2208PIS\ndKL(\u00b5i,j , 1/2)E [Ni,j(T )] \u2265 (1\u2212 o(1)) log T,\n(1)\nwhere\nPIS = PIS(i1, i2, l, I, S) := {(i1, j) : j \u2208 I} \u222a {(i2, j) : j \u2208 S}.\nIntuitively, Lemma 1 can be interpreted as follows: for each round t, consistency requires an algorithm to identify one of the Copeland winners i1 with confidence level\n1/t. For some i2, l, I, and S, if the preferences among the pairs in PIS(i1, i2, l, I, S) are inverted, then arm i2 6= i1 has Li2 \u2264 l and Li1 \u2265 l + 1, which implies that i1 is not a Copeland winner. We need to limit all such risks for all possible i2, l, I, S. Each risk is calculated in accordance with the large deviation principle (Cover & Thomas, 2006) as\u223c exp (\u2212 \u2211 PIS dKL(\u00b5i,j , 1/2)Ni,j(t)), and the algorithm must continue comparing pairs in PIS until \u2211 PIS dKL(\u00b5i,j , 1/2)Ni,j(t) \u223c log t in order to lower the risk to exp (\u2212 log t) = 1/t for each PIS .\nThe proof of Lemma 1 is in Appendix E. Note that all proofs are in Supplementary Material. The technique used in the proof extends the one of Lai & Robbins (1985) for the standard bandit problem in two aspects: (i) in the standard bandit problem, each arm is associated with a single distribution, whereas in the Copeland dueling bandit problem each arm is related to K \u2212 1 distributions (i.e., comparison with other arms). Therefore, not all of the pairs are required to be drawn, and we need a sophisticated analysis to determine the set of conditions that consistency requires. Moreover, (ii) the Copeland winner is not necessarily unique; there can be several ties with the maximum Copeland number. We show that consistency requires an algorithm to find at least one of the Copeland winners, but it does not need to find all of them.\nNext, we derive the asymptotic regret lower bound, which is the minimum amount of regret such that inequality (1) is satisfied. Let {\u03bdi,j} be a K \u00d7K preference matrix, and let the superiors and the inferiors under the preference matrix {\u03bdi,j} be S\u0302i = S\u0302i({\u03bdi,j}) := {j \u2208 [K] : \u03bdi,j < 1/2} and I\u0302i = I\u0302i({\u03bdi,j}) := {j \u2208 [K] : \u03bdi,j > 1/2}. Moreover, let the number of the superiors be L\u0302i = L\u0302i(\u03bdi,j) := |S\u0302i(\u03bdi,j)|, and the a-th smallest element among {L\u0302i}i\u2208[K] be L\u0302(a) = L\u0302(a)({\u03bdi,j}); let the Copeland winner be C\u0302cop = C\u0302cop({\u03bdi,j}) := {i : L\u0302i = L\u0302(1)({\u03bdi,j})} \u2282 [K].

Moreover, let r\u0302i,j({\u03bdi,j}) := (L\u0302i + L\u0302j \u2212\n2L\u0302(1))/(2(K \u2212 1)) be the regret per draw with {\u03bdi,j} and\nC\u2217i1({\u03bdi,j}) := inf{qi,j}i>j\u2208Ri1 ({\u03bdi,j}) \u2211\n(i,j)\u2208Pi6=j\nr\u0302i,jqi,j ,\nand let the (possibly non-unique) set of optimal solutions be\nR\u2217i1({\u03bdi,j}) := { {qi,j}i>j \u2208 Ri1({\u03bdi,j}) :\u2211 (i,j)\u2208Pi6=j r\u0302i,jqi,j = C \u2217 i1({\u03bdi,j}) } .\nThe value C\u2217i1({\u00b5i,j}) log T is the possible minimum regret for exploration to make sure that the arm i1 is in [C]. Using Lemma 1 yields the following regret lower bound.\nTheorem 2. The regret of a strongly consistent algorithm is lower bounded as:\nE[R(T )] \u2265 min i1\u2208[C] C\u2217i1({\u00b5i,j}) log T \u2212 o(log T ).\nThe proof of Theorem 2 is in Appendix E."}, {"heading": "3.1. Comparison with the Consistency in Condorcet dueling bandits", "text": "A dueling bandit algorithm is strongly consistent in the sense of Condorcet if it has subpolynomial regret for any M \u2208 MCond, whereMCond is the set of preference matrices in which the Condorcet winner (i.e., the Copeland winner i1 of Li1 = 0) exists (Komiyama et al., 2015a). Although the definitions of the regret in the two dueling bandit problems are slightly different, they are the same in that drawing pairs that include non-Copeland winners increases regret, and thus a subpolynomial regret in the sense of the Condorcet dueling bandit problem is consistent with the one of the Copeland dueling bandit problem. Therefore, a strongly consistent Copeland dueling bandit algorithm is also strongly consistent in the sense of the Condorcet dueling bandit problem sinceMCop \u2283 MCond. The converse is not necessarily true: when we run a Condorcet dueling bandit algorithm with a preference matrix without a Condorcet winner, it can fail to identify a Copeland winner.\nAn example in which the two consistencies make a difference is in Table 2. RMED2FH (Komiyama et al., 2015a), an optimal algorithm for solving the Condorcet dueling bandit problem, may not be consistent in the sense of Copeland; RMED2FH draws pairs (2, 3), (2, 4), and (3, 4) to prove that each of 2, 3, and 4 is beaten by another arm, which implies that these arms are non-Condorcet. However, in the sense of Copeland, an algorithm must make sure that the superior of arm 1 is smaller than those of the other arms, and thus, it needs to compare arm 1 with the others for sufficiently many times."}, {"heading": "4.

Otherwise, it enters the loop that sequentially draws each pair in LC . After drawing each pair, it checks whether the current observation is sufficient or not.

In the case of this paper the number of constraints of the LP is exponential in K and a naive use of an LP solver is sometimes very slow. It is well known that even if there are exponentially many constraints an LP can be solved by using the ellipsoid method (Khachiyan, 1980) in a polynomial time if there exists a polynomial-time oracle that (i) checks whether a point {qij} is feasible or not and (ii) returns a hyperplane such that {qij} and the feasible region are separated if {qij} is infeasible. Such an oracle is easily constructed based on the\nsorting described above, and thus {q\u2217i,j} \u2208 R\u2217i1({\u00b5\u0302i,j(t)}) can be computed in a polynomial time. Although the ellipsoid method is practically very slow, a practical combinatorial algorithm is often derived later for many problems that are solvable by the ellipsoid method (see, e.g., Korte & Vygen 2007, Chapters 1\u20134 and 12). Thus the authors think that R\u2217i1({\u00b5\u0302i,j(t)}) can be computed practically.

(2015b), which is derived from the Microsoft Learning to Rank (MSLR) dataset (Microsoft Research, 2010; Qin et al., 2010) that consists of relevance information between queries and documents with more than 30K queries. Zoghi et al. (2015b) created a finite set of rankers, each of which corresponds to a ranking feature in the base dataset. The value \u00b5i,j is the probability that the ranker i beats ranker j based on the informational click model (Hofmann et al., 2013). We randomly chose subsets of rankers in our experiments and made sub preference matrices. We excluded cases with extremely small gaps such that |\u00b5i,j \u2212 1/2| < 0.005 for K = 16 or |\u00b5i,j \u2212 1/2| < 0.0005 for K = 64. Furthermore, we selected the submatrices in which the Condorcet winner exists (Figure 1(a)) and the Condorcet winner does not exist (Figures 1(b) and 1(c)).\nSushi: This dataset is based on the sushi preference dataset (Kamishima, 2003) that contains the preferences of 5, 000 Japanese users as regards to 100 types of sushi. We extracted 16 types of sushi and converted them into a preference matrix with \u00b5i,j corresponding to the ratio of users who prefer sushi i over j, which is shown in Table 3(a) in Appendix.\nGap is the preference matrix of Table 3(b) in Appendix.

The results with smaller preference matrices are shown in Appendix B.\nAlgorithms: We compared the following algorithms: Random is a uniformly random sampling among pairs. Copeland SAVAGE with \u03b4 = 1/T is the algorithm that is general enough to solve the Copeland dueling bandit problems and have O(K2 log T ) regret bounds. We did not include PBR and RankEI because the two algorithms are reported to be consistently outperformed by other algorithms (Zoghi et al., 2015a). RUCB (Zoghi et al., 2014) with \u03b1 = 0.51 and RMED1 (Komiyama et al., 2015a) are algorithms for solving Condorcet dueling bandit problems. These algorithms are not designed to find all instances of Copeland dueling bandit problems. The values of the hyperparameters of RMED1 are the same as in Komiyama et al. (2015a). CCB (Zoghi et al., 2015a) with \u03b1 = 0.51 and our ECW-RMED with \u03b1 = 3.0 and \u03b2 = 0.01 are algorithms designed for the Copeland dueling bandit problems.\nResults: Figure 1 plots the regrets of the algorithms. SAVAGE did not perform well for in any of the experiments. RMED1 performed best in MSLR (Condorcet). However, in datasets such as MSLR (non-Condorcet) and MultiSol where the Condorcet winner does not exist, it suffered a large regret. RUCB did not perform better than RMED1 and showed a similar tendency. These observations support the hypothesis that these algorithms are not capable of finding a Copeland winner. CCB performed similarly to RUCB in many datasets and outperformed RUCB for the datasets without a Condorcet winner. ECW-RMED significantly outperformed CCB and in all datasets, including Gap in which the uniqueness assumption of Theorem 4 is violated. In particular, in MSLR non-Condorcet dataset with K = 16, the regret of ECW-RMED was more than three times smaller than that of CCB.

Second, the regret bound of ECW-RMED (inequality (5)) requires that (i) the arm 1 beats all other arms in I1 and (ii) the other arms loses at least L1 times: It requires N1,2(T ), N1,3(T ), N1,4(T ) \u2265 (log T )/dKL(0.6, 0.5). Finally, the regret bound of CCB ((R(T )/ log T ) = 2K(C+L1+1)\u22062 = 1600) is much larger because it corresponds to the exploration for checking that (i) arm 1 wins against all other arms (CK pairs) and (ii) the other arms loses at least L1 + 1 times ((L1 + 1)K pairs).

First, we show that there exists a optimal solution of (6) such that\ne\u2032\u03c31 \u2265 e \u2032 \u03c32 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 e \u2032 \u03c3|S|\n(17)\nfor the following reason; let {e\u2032\u2032j } be an arbitrary optimal solution. If there exists a pair i < j such that e\u2032\u2032\u03c3i > e \u2032\u2032 \u03c3j , swapping the values of e\u2032\u2032\u03c3i for e \u2032\u2032 \u03c3j does not increase the objective value since c\u03c3i \u2264 c\u03c3j , and recursively applying this swap operation yields another optimal solution {e\u2032j} such that (17) holds. The constraint in (6) for {e\u2032j} satisfying (17) is equivalent to\u2211 o\u2208k+1,...,|S| e\u2032\u03c3o \u2265 1. (18) Let the number of gaps be D := \u2211|S|\u22121 i=1 1{e\u2032\u03c3i > e \u2032 \u03c3i+1 , e \u2032 \u03c3i+1 > 0}. In the following, we show that if D > 0 there exists another optimal solution with a smaller value ofD. LetD > 0 and i < |S| be the smallest index such that e\u2032\u03c3i > e \u2032 \u03c3i+1 > 0. (i) if i \u2264 k, replacing e\u2032\u03c31 , . . . , e \u2032 \u03c3i with e \u2032 \u03c3i+1 does not increase the objective since each c\u03c3i is non-negative. This operation yields another optimal solution that satisfies (17) and (18) with a smaller value of D, which is illustrated in Figure 3(a). (ii) If i > k and D \u2265 2, let S = \u2211|S| j=i+1 e \u2032 \u03c3j . Then,\ne\u2032\u2032\u03c3j =  e\u2032\u03c3i (if (j \u2212 i)e \u2032 \u03c3i \u2265 S) e\u2032\u03c3i(j \u2212 i)\u2212 S (if (j \u2212 i+ 1)e \u2032 \u03c3i \u2265 S > (j \u2212 i)e \u2032 \u03c3i )\n0 (otherwise)\nhas equal or smaller value of the objective since c\u03c3j is non-decreasing in j. Therefore, {e\u2032\u2032j } is an optimal solution withD \u2264 1 such that (17) and (18) hold, which is illustrated in Figure 3(b). (iii) If i > k and D = 1, then \u2211i j=1 c\u03c3j = (i\u2212 k)c\u03c3i+1 always hold. Otherwise, for sufficiently small \u03b4 > 0 either of (iii-a) increasing e\u2032\u03c31 , . . . , e \u2032 \u03c3i by \u03b4 and decreasing \u03c3i+1 by (i \u2212 k)\u03b4 or (iii-b) decreasing e\u2032\u03c31 , . . . , e \u2032 \u03c3i by \u03b4 and increasing \u03c3i+1 by (i \u2212 k)\u03b4 must decrease the objective, which\ncontradicts the assumption that {e\u2032j} is optimal. Therefore, \u2211i j=1 c\u03c3j = (i\u2212 k)c\u03c3i+1 . Then,\ne\u2032\u2032\u03c3j =\n{ e\u2032\u03c3i + e \u2032 \u03c3i+1/(i\u2212 k) (if j \u2264 i)\n0 (otherwise)\nhas the same value of the objective function, and it satisfies (17) and (18).

In summary, if D > 0, one can apply one of the operations (i)\u2013(iii) that yields a modified optimal solution with a smaller value of D.

(The continuity of the solution function) The point-to-set map R+1,\u2217i1 ({\u03bdi,j}) : MCop \u2192 2 [0,\u221e)K(K\u22121) is continuous at {\u03bdi,j} = {\u00b5i,j}.\nThe continuity and the uniqueness of the optimal solution function R+1,\u2217i1 ({\u00b5i,j}) implies that all solutions of R+1,\u2217i1 ({\u03bdi,j}) approach R +1,\u2217 i1\n({\u00b5i,j}) (= R\u2217i1({\u00b5i,j}), unique) when {\u03bdi,j} is sufficiently close to {\u00b5i,j}. To prove Lemma 14, we first restate the following three Lemmas of Hogan (1973):\nLemma 15. (Theorem 10 of Hogan 1973) Let g be a set of real-valued functions on X \u00d7 Y , and P (x) := {y \u2208 Y : g(x, y) \u2264 0} be a map of feasible solutions. If each component of g is continuous on x0 \u00d7 Y , then P is closed at x0. Lemma 16. (Theorem 12 of Hogan 1973) If Y is convex and normed, if each component of g is continuous on x0\u00d7P (x0) and convex in y for each fixed x \u2208 X , and if there exists a y0 such that g(x0, y0) < 0, then P is open at x0. Lemma 17. (Corollary 8.1 of Hogan 1973) Let \u2126 : X \u2192 2Y be a point-to-set map and M(x) := {y \u2208 \u2126(x) : supy\u2032\u2208\u2126(x) f(x, y\n\u2032) = f(x, y)} be an optimal solution function of some real-valued function f on X \u00d7 Y . Suppose \u2126 is continuous at x0, f is continuous on x0 \u00d7 \u2126(x0), M is non-empty and uniformly compact near x0, and M(x0) is unique. Then, M is continuous at x0.\nProof of Lemma 14. We first show the continuity of the feasible solution function R+1i ({\u03bdi,j}) at {\u03bdi,j} = {\u00b5i,j}. The continuity of each component of g as a function of {\u03bdi,j}, {qi,j} follows from the continuity of the KL divergence, and thus, applying Lemma 15 for P = R+1i1 , x0 = {\u00b5i,j} and g({\u03bdi,j}, {qi,j}) = {1\u2212 \u2211 (i,j)\u2208PIS qi,jdKL(\u03bdi,j , 1/2)}i2,l,I,S yields the closedness ofR+1i1 at {\u00b5i,j}. Moreover, by (i) continuity of each component of g, (ii) linearity of each component of g as a function of {qi,j} for each {\u03bdi,j}, and (iii) the fact that {q\u2032i,j} := {(1/dKL(\u03bdi,j , 1/2)) + 1}K(K\u22121) satisfies\u2211\n(i,j)\u2208PIS\nq\u2032i,jdKL(\u03bdi,j , 1/2) > 1, (29)\napplying Lemma 16 to the same P, x0, g and y0 = {(1/dKL(\u03bdi,j , 1/2)) + 1} yields the openness of R+1i1 at {\u00b5i,j}. The continuity ofR+1i1 follows from its closedness and the openness.\nFinally, by using the continuity ofR+1i1 and C +1,\u2217 i , and uniform compactness and uniqueness ofR +1,\u2217 i1\nat {\u00b5i,j}, applying Lemma 17 to M = R+1,\u2217i1 , \u2126 = R +1 i1 , and f = C\u2217i1 yields the continuity ofR +1,\u2217 i1 at {\u00b5i,j}.\nProof of Lemma 12. By using the continuity ofR+1,\u2217i1 ({\u03bdi,j}) (Lemma 14),R \u2217 i1 ({\u03bdi,j}) \u2282 R+1,\u2217i1 ({\u03bdi,j}), and the uniqueness of arg mini1\u2208[C] C \u2217 i1 ({\u00b5i,j}) andR\u2217i1({\u00b5i,j}), there exists (\u03b4) such that \u2192 0 as \u03b4 \u2192 +0 and\nT\u2211 t=1 1[Yi,j(t),Z\u03b4(t)] \u2264 T\u2211 n=1 1 [ T\u22c3 t=1 {Yi,j(t),Z\u03b4(t), Ni,j(t) = n} ]\n\u2264 T\u2211 n=1 1 [ T\u22c3 t=1 { n/ log t \u2264 (1 + (\u03b4))R\u2217i,j }] \u2264 (1 + (\u03b4))R\u2217i,j log T + 1.\nThe same arguments also applies to ECW-RMED."}, {"heading": "L.

Furthermore, we selected the submatrices in which the Condorcet winner exists (Figure 1(a)) and the Condorcet winner does not exist (Figures 1(b) and 1(c)). Sushi: This dataset is based on the sushi preference dataset (Kamishima, 2003) that contains the preferences of 5, 000 Japanese users as regards to 100 types of sushi. We extracted 16 types of sushi and converted them into a preference matrix with \u03bci,j corresponding to the ratio of users who prefer sushi i over j, which is shown in Table 3(a) in Appendix. Gap is the preference matrix of Table 3(b) in Appendix. This matrix is a corner case in which (arg mini1 C E\u2217 i1 ({\u03bci,j}))/(arg mini1 C \u2217 i\u2217({\u03bci,j})) > 100.

Algorithms: We compared the following algorithms: Random is a uniformly random sampling among pairs. Copeland SAVAGE with \u03b4 = 1/T is the algorithm that is general enough to solve the Copeland dueling bandit problems and have O(K log T ) regret bounds. We did not include PBR and RankEI because the two algorithms are reported to be consistently outperformed by other algorithms (Zoghi et al., 2015a). RUCB (Zoghi et al., 2014) with \u03b1 = 0.51 and RMED1 (Komiyama et al., 2015a) are algorithms for solving Condorcet dueling bandit problems.
