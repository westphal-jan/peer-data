Introduction", "text": "Similes are figures of speech which compares two objects through the use of specific connection words (Harris and others, 2002), but where comparison is not intended to be taken literally (e.g \u201dhladan k\u2019o krastavac\u201d \u2013 as cool as a cucumber). They are often used as metaphors, but connection words (such as \u201dlike\u201d and \u201das\u201d) are used explicitly (Cooper, 1986; Niculae, 2013). In many languages, similes are considered as an important building block of spoken language and are part of cultural heritage. In Serbian, for example, Vuk Karadz\u030cic\u0301 attempted to collect similes, together with other short figures of speech in the XIX century (Karadz\u030cic\u0301, 1849). While some of the collected similes are still used (e.g. \u201dbela kao sneg\u201d \u2013 white as snow), some have evolved (e.g. \u201dgladan kao kurjak\u201d \u2013 hungry as a wolf is now more often appearing as \u201dgladan kao vuk\u201d \u2013 hungry as a wolf ) and some are rarely used and may not even be understood with the current speakers (e.g. \u201dcrveni se kao oderano govec\u030ce\u201d \u2013 red as skinned ox). Of course, a number of new similes have emerged. During the XX century, there were attempts to collect proverbs and other short forms from particular geographical areas (Markovic\u0301, 1979; Jevtic\u0301, 1969; Vukanovic\u0301, 1983; Cvetanovic\u0301, 1980), but little has been done in updating similes. To the best of our knowledge, there is no large-scale text mining approach to collecting similes in Serbian, but there have been attempts to collect them in other languages. For example, Veale and Hao (2007) created an approach for automated extraction of explicit similes in English. They modelled them as \u201dX is as P as Y\u201d, where X and Y are nouns and P is an adjective. Bin et al. (2012) used similar approach, querying Baidu search engine for Chinese similes. Aasheim (2012) differentiates two types of similes: nominal (like a/an + noun) and adjectival (as + adjective + as + noun). In Slavic languages, simile expressions are based on the preposition \u201dlike\u201d or \u201das\u201d (kak in Russian, kao in Serbian, ako in Slovak, etc.) and introduce a noun phrase (NP) agreeing in case with the standard of comparison (Rappaport, 1998). In this paper we explore how we can update the corpus of similes in Serbian using the World Wide Web\nand crowd-sourcing. The World Wide Web in particular provides people with novel ways to express themselves on a variety of media such as Wikis, question-answer databases, blogs, forums, review-sites and social media. As such, it is an increasingly important resource for exploring linguistic changes and trends, especially as its form is in-between written and spoken languages. Our semiautomated methodology utilises natural language processing, machine learning techniques and manual curation to ensure the validity of extracted data."}, {"heading": "2. Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1. Method Overview", "text": "The methodology consists of four steps (see Figure 1): firstly we collect the documents for processing; in the second step we process these documents and extract all comparisons; in the third step, we use machine learning to distinguish similes from the other expressions that function as comparisons; in the final step, a human curator reviews the data and corrects any mistakes. Also, users of our crowdsourcing website can propose new similes and help to collect the similes that were not collected by the text mining pipeline; the curator checks these manually."}, {"heading": "2.2. Crawler", "text": "In order to collect texts from which to mine similes, we have developed a number of crawlers crafted for particular websites. The aim was to download all potentially meaningful text from these websites, but skip contentless parts or parts where similes are unlikely, such as menus, headings and footers. In order to do that, each crawler extracts only text that is inside the div HTML tag with a particular id. Crawlers follow links on each page they visit, but not outside the domain of the website. We have developed separate crawlers for the following four domains:\n\u2022 laguna.rs - one of the biggest book publishers with abstracts, reviews and parts of the books on their website;\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n06 31\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n0 M\nay 2\n01 6\n\u2022 rastko.rs - a project that aims to make a digital library of books and articles in Serbian that are considered cultural heritage;\n\u2022 burek.com - a large general public forum on Serbian;\n\u2022 tarzanija.com - a popular blog portal with sarcastic comments on various issues.\nFor crawling and processing we used Scrapy, an open source Python framework for extracting data from website1."}, {"heading": "2.3. Modelling and extracting candidate similes", "text": "The connection word used in similes in Serbian is kao - like, as, but it also often appears in shorter forms \u201dk\u2019o\u201d or \u201dko\u201d (misspelled). There are two main categories of simile in Serbian:\n\u2022 Adjectival: Adjective + Connection word (\u201dkao\u201d) + Noun Phrase (e.g. \u201dlep kao cvet\u201d \u2013 beautiful as a flower)\n\u2022 Verbal: Verb + Connection word (\u201dkao\u201d) + Noun Phrase (e.g. \u201dradi kao konj\u201d \u2013 \u201dworks like a horse\u201d)\n1http://scrapy.org/\nBoth of these categorise can be modelled by this expression:\n(V |A|V se) (kao|ko|k\u2032o) (NP ) (1)\nA typical noun phrase consists of a noun together with zero or more dependents of various types, such as determiners, adjectives, adjective phrases, noun adjuncts, prepositional phrases, participle phrases or pronouns (Crystal, 2011). However, currently publicly available part-of-speech taggers and parsers for Serbian can tag only individual words, but not phrases. Because of this, it was not possible to rely on a tagger to identify noun phrases. We therefore modelled candidate similes as a verb or adjective followed by explicit use of connection words \u201dkao\u201d, \u201dk\u2019o\u201d or \u201dko\u201d, followed by one or more adjectives and terminated with a noun:\n(V |A|V se) (kao|ko|k\u2032o) ((A|N)\u2217) (N) (2)\nThe noun phrase model that we used models the majority of commonly used noun phrases in Serbian. However, noun phrases and similes often contain prepositions. e.g. \u201dsmoren kao zmaj u vatrogasnoj stanici\u201d (bored like a dragon at a fire station). Our model will currently pick up \u201dsmoren kao zmaj\u201d (bored like a dragon), which is also a simile used quite frequently, but we would rely on manual curation to extend it with the prepositional phrase. In the next step of the pipeline, we use retrieved textual documents to extract candidate comparisons. We used a part of speech (POS) model for Croatian and Serbian (Agic\u0301 et al., 2013) and plugged it into the HunPos tagger (Hala\u0301csy et al., 2007). We used the model 2 for matching similes."}, {"heading": "2.4. Simile classifier", "text": "After a review of initial outputs, we noted a large number of false positives. The model would find similes such as \u201dradi kao konj\u201d (works like a horse), but it would also extract expressions like \u201dradi kao pravnik\u201d (works as a lawyer), which is not a comparison, but rather specifies someone\u2019s profession. There is no lexical feature that would give a cue that these two phrases are in any way different and only semantics (and context) would differentiate the similes from other expressions. However, current publicly available tools for Serbian do not process phrases at the semantic level and thus we decided to rely on a classifier and a final curator\u2019s manual review of the phrases. From the initial data, we have created a sufficient number of true positive and false positive examples that could be used for machine learning. This data was used to create a machine-learning based classifier that can distinguish true similes from the other phrases that have same lexical characteristics. The dataset contained 300 examples of true positive and 300 examples of false positive similes to train and test our algorithm. For the features, we used\n\u2022 the whole simile phrase (for illustration we will use \u201dradi kao konj\u201d \u2013 \u201dworks like a horse\u201d),\n\u2022 the stemmed phrase (\u201drad ka konj\u201d),\n\u2022 left side of the phrase that is before the connection word (\u201dradi\u201d \u2013 works),\n\u2022 left side stemmed (\u201drad\u201d),\n\u2022 the part of phrase that is on the right from the connection word (\u201dkonj\u201d \u2013 horse), and\n\u2022 the stemmed right part (\u201dkonj\u201d).\nFor stemming we used stemmer for Serbian (Milos\u030cevic\u0301, 2012), that was ported for Python2. We experimented with Multinominal Naive Bayes, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a polynomial kernel that uses sequential minimal optimisation. For machine learning we used Weka toolkit (Hall et al., 2009). The models are downloadable from the corpus website3."}, {"heading": "2.5. Curation interface", "text": "We have created a web portal4 for viewing, searching and editing the dataset collected from the previous steps. The portal has the following curation features:\n\u2022 Viewing of all currently curated similes, sorted alphabetically\n\u2022 Searching for simile. Searches are performed by using the stemmer for Serbian, so the similes that are not in exactly the same form in the database can be retrieved. Since Serbian is highly inflectional, the aim was to store only one canonical instance (single inflection) of each simile. For example \u201dbeo kao sneg\u201d (m), \u201dbela kao sneg\u201d (f) and \u201dbelo kao sneg\u201d (n) (\u201dwhite as a snow\u201d in three different grammatical genders - masculine, feminine, neuter), will be treated by our search algorithm as the expression. Search interface can be seen in Figure 2.\n\u2022 Adding a new simile to the database. Users of the website are able to manually add similes that are rare or missing from the corpus. If the user wants to add simile that already exists in the database, he/she will be notified. Added simile won\u2019t be visible on the website until curator approves it.\n\u2022 Curation interface. Curators can login to the website and perform curation task, such as approving, rejecting or editing similes."}, {"heading": "3. Results", "text": "The crawlers downloaded 40,239 documents from the web (See Table 1). Using semi-automated workflow, we extracted potential similes and manually reviewed them. A total of 446 true similes were finally harvested. A manual review of a data also revealed that there were around 5,000 false positives. Our classification approach proved to be useful in filtering some of these out - the results are presented in Table 2.\n2https://github.com/nikolamilosevic86/ SerbianStemmer\n3http://ezbirka.starisloveni.com/ download.html\n4http://ezbirka.starisloveni.com\nWe merged the similes obtained from the web with the simile corpus published by Vuk Karadz\u030cic\u0301 (Karadz\u030cic\u0301, 1849), who collected 333 similes. It is interesting that there was only a small overlap between the two simile datasets. Overlap between these two corpora can be seen in Table 4 The similes collected by Karadz\u030cic\u0301 were generally more complex, which could be due to the termination rule on noun in our model, so the model might be missing some complex similes. Although, this is an obvious limitation of the system, collection of complex similes will be part of the future work, and also will rely on crowdsourcing interface. At the moment of writing this paper, we had 852 approved similes in our corpus."}, {"heading": "4. Summary", "text": "In this paper we present initial work towards building a corpus of similes in Serbian and a methodology for a semiautomated creation of simile corpus. We have kick-started the process by processing a set of web sites that are likely to have a number of similes. The current corpus, with 852 similes is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest simile corpus in Serbian. We believe that, by mining more web pages for similes and by the use of crowdsourcing, the corpus will grow and remain up to date. Still, the current methodology will need to be improved through the use of semantic resources (e.g. WordNet) and contextualisation. The International Standard Language Resource Number (ISLRN) of the Serbian Simile Corpus is 534-837-568- 404-3. It is freely available at http://www.ezbirka. starisloveni.com/.

In this paper we present a methodology for semi-automated collection of similes from the world wide web using text mining techniques. We expanded an existing corpus of traditional similes (containing 333 similes) by collecting 446 additional expressions. We, also, explore how crowdsourcing can be used to extract and curate new similes.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
