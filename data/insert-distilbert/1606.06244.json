It is natural in this setting for each player to use a learning algorithm that guarantees small regret to decide on their strategies , as the environment is constantly changing due to strategy choices of the other players. It is well known that such decentralized no-regret dynamics are guaranteed to converge to a form of equilibrium of the game. Furthermore, in a large class of games, termed smooth games by Roughgarden [Rou15], they converge to outcomes with approximately optimal social welfare matching the price of anarchy, the welfare loss of Nash equilibria. In cost minimization games the overall cost is \u03bb/(1\u2212\u00b5) times the minimal cost, while in smooth mechanisms [ST13] (such as auctions) it is \u03bb/max(1, \u00b5) times the maximum total utility, for parameters \u03bb and \u00b5 of the smoothness conditions. Examples of smooth games and mechanisms include routing games, andmany forms of auction games, including ad-auctions, see [Rou15, ST13].\nThe speed at which the game outcome converges to this approximately optimal welfare is governed by individual players\u2019 regret bounds. There is a large number of simple regret minimization algorithms (multiplicative weights, mirror decent, follow the regularized leader, see e.g. [Haz16]) guaranteeing that the average regret goes down as O(1/ \u221a T) with time T, which is tight in adversarial settings.\nTaking advantage of the fact that playing a game against opponents who themselves are also using regretminimization innot a truly adversarial setting, a sequence of papers [DDK15,RS13b, SALS15] showed that byusing specific learning algorithms, the dependence onTof this convergence rate can be improved inO(1/T). Concretely, Syrgkanis et al [SALS15] show this for all algorithms satisfying the so-called RVU property (regret by variation in utilities), which include the Optimistic Mirror Descent of [RS13b], converge at a O(1/T) rate with a fixed number of players.\nOne issue with the works of [DDK15, RS13b, SALS15] is that they use expected loss as their feedback model to the players. In each round, each player receives the expected cost of each of their actions in expectation over the current strategies of all other players. This clearly represents more information than is realistically available to players in games \u2013 at most each player sees the cost of each of her actions given the actions taken by the other players (realized feedback). In fact, even if each player had access to the action distributions of the other players, simply computing this expectation is generally intractable when n, the number of players, is large.\nWe improve the result of [SALS15] on the convergence to approximate optimality in smooth games in a number of different aspects. To achieve this, we relax the quality of approximation from the bound guaranteed by smoothness. Typical smoothness bounds on the price of anarchy in auctions are small constants, such a factor of 1.58 or 2 in item auctions. The simple idea of increasing the approximation we consider by an arbitrarily small constant \u01eb > 0 enables the following results:\n\u2022 We show that learning algorithms obtaining fast convergence are ubiquitous. \u2022 We improve the speed of convergence by a factor of n, the number of players. \u2022 For all our results, players only need feedback based on realized outcomes, not expected\noutcomes. \u2022 We show that convergence occurs with high probability in most settings. \u2022 We further extend the results to show that it is enough for the players to observe realized\nbandit feedback, only seeing the outcome of the action they play.\n\u2022 Our results apply to settings where the set of players in the game changes over time [LST16]. We strengthen previous results in such settings by showing that a broader class of algorithms achieves approximate efficiency under significant churn.\nWe achieve these results by introducing a propertywe termLowApproximate Regret in Section 2.1, which simply states that an online learning algorithm achieves good regret against a multiplicative approximation of the best action in hindsight. This property is satisfied bymanyknown algorithms, including even the vanilla Hedge algorithm, as well as Optimistic Hedge (via a novel analysis). The crux of our analysis technique is the simple observation that formany types of data-dependent regret boundswe can fold part of the regret bound into the comparator term, allowing us to explore the trade-off between additive and multiplicative approximation.\nIn Section 3, we show that LowApproximateRegret implies fast convergence to the price of anarchy guaranteed by the smoothness property, and only requires feedback from the realization of actions played by other players, not their action distribution, or the expectation over their actions. We further show that this convergence occurs with high probability in most settings, and not only in expectation. For games with a large number of players, we also improve the speed of convergence. [SALS15] shows that players using Optimistic Hedge in a repeated game with n players, converge to the approximately optimal outcome guaranteed by smoothness at a rate of O(n2/T). They also offer an analysis guaranteeing O(n/T) speed of convergence, at the expense of a constant factor decrease in the quality of approximation (e.g., a factor of 4 in atomic congestion games with affine congestion). We achieve the convergence bound of O(n/T) with only an arbitrarily small loss in the approximation bound.\nIn Section 3, we show that in the full information setting, algorithms that satisfy the Low Approximate Regret property are ubiquitous, including simple, efficient algorithms such as Hedge and its variants. Armed with the knowledge that this broad class of algorithms experiences fast convergence in realistic settings, one can more reliably predict when fast convergence will occur in practice.\nComparing our work to [SALS15] in more detail, we note that our Low Approximate Regret property is broader than their RVU property. Further, LowApproximate Regret algorithms require only realized feedback, while the analysis of the RVU property in [SALS15] requires expected feedback. To see the contrast, consider the load balancing game introduced in [KP09] with two players and two bins, where each player selects a bin and observes cost given by the number of players in that bin. Initialized at the uniform distribution, any learning algorithmwith expectation feedback (particularly those considered in [SALS15]) will simply stay at the uniform distribution forever, because the expected cost vector distributes cost equally across the two bins. This gives low regret under expected costs, but suppose we were interested in realized costs: The only \u201cblack box\u201d way to lift the [SALS15] to this case would be to simply evaluate the regret bound above under realized costs, but here players will experience \u0398(1/ \u221a T) variation because they select bins uniformly at random, ruining the fast convergence. Our analysis essentially sidesteps this issue because individual players naturally concentrate at Low Approximate Regret.\nIn Section 4 we consider games where players can only observe the loss of the action they played given the actions taken by the other players, and receive no feedback for actions not played (bandit feedback). [RS13b] analyzed zero-sum games to bandit feedback, but assumed players receive expected cost over the strategies of all other players. We propose a new algorithm based on log-\nbarrier regularizationwith importance sampling that guarantees fast convergence ofO(d logT/\u01eb) in this setting, where d is the number of actions. Known techniques such as adaptations of SCRiBLe (see [RS13a]), would result in a convergence rate of O(d3 logT). Our technique improving the dependence of the regret bounds on the number of experts d is of independent interest.\nFinally, in Section 5, we consider the dynamic population game setting of Lykouris et al. [LST16], where players are entering and leaving the game over time. [LST16] showed that regret bounds for shifting experts directly influence the rate at which players can turn over and still guarantee close to optimal solution on average. We show that a number of learning algorithms have the Low Approximate Regret property even in the shifting experts setting, allowing us to extend the fast convergence result to dynamic games. Such learning algorithms include a noisy version of Hedge, as well as AdaNormalHedge [LS15] which was previously analyzed in the dynamic setting in [LST16]. The smaller approximate regret error allows us to increase the turnover rate from the one in [LST16], while also widening and simplifying the class of learning algorithms that players can use to guarantee the close to optimal average welfare."}, {"heading": "2 Repeated Games and Learning Dynamics", "text": "We consider a game G among a set of n players. Each player i has an action space Si and a cost function costi : S1\u00d7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00d7Sn \u2192 [0, 1] thatmaps an action profile s = (s1, . . . , sn) to the cost costi(s) that player experiences. We assume that the action space of each player has cardinality d, i.e. |Si| = d. We let w = (w1, . . . ,wn) denote a list of probability distributions over all players\u2019 actions, where wi \u2208 \u2206(Si) and wi,x is the probability of action x \u2208 Si. Analogous quantities for utility maximization games are defined in Appendix D.\nWe consider the setting where the game G is played repeatedly for T time steps. At each time step t each player i picks a probability distribution wt\ni \u2208 \u2206(Si) over actions and draws their action sti\nfrom this distribution. Depending on the game playing environment under consideration, players will receive different types of feedback after each step. Most of this paper considers feedback where at the end of the iteration each player i observes the utility she would have received had she played any possible action x \u2208 Si given the actions taken by the other players. More formally let ct i,x = costi(x, s t \u2212i), where s t \u2212i is the set of strategies of all but the i th player at step t, and let ct i = (ct i,x )x\u2208Si . Note that the expected cost of player i at iteration t (conditioned on the other players\u2019 actions) is simply the inner product \u3008wt\ni , ct i \u3009.\nWe refer to this form of feedback as realized feedback since it only depends on the realized actions st\u2212i sampled by the oponents \u2013 it does not directly depend on their distributions wt\u2212i. This should be contrasted with the expectation feedback used by [SALS15, DDK15, RS13b], where player i observes Est\u2212i\u223cw t \u2212i [costi(x, s t \u2212i)] for each x.\nSections 4 and 5 consider extensions of our repeated game model. In Section 4 we examine partial information (\u201cbandit\u201d) feedback, where players observe only the cost of their own realized actions. In Section 5 we consider a setting where the player set is evolving over time. Here we use the dynamic populationmodel of Lykouris et al. [LST16], where at each round t each player i is replaced (\u201cturns over\u201d) with some probability p. The new player has cost function costt\ni (\u00b7) and action space\nSt i which may change arbitrarily subject to certain constraints. We will formalize this notion later on."}, {"heading": "2.1 Learning Dynamics", "text": "We assume that players select their actions using a learning algorithm satisfying a property we call Low Approximate Regret, which simply requires that the cumulative cost of the learner multiplicatively approximates the cost of the best action they could have chosen in hindsight. We will see in subsequent sections that this property is ubiquitous and leads to fast convergence in a robust range of settings. Definition 1.

(2)\nIn the bandit feedback setting, we require (1) or (2) to hold in expectations over the realized strategies of player i.\nWe will use the version of the Low Approximate Regret property with shifting experts when consideringplayers in a dynamic population games in Section 5. In this case, the game environment can be constantly changing due to churn in the population, and we need the players to have low approximate regret with shifting experts to guarantee high social welfare despite the churn.\nAll algorithms we are aware of that satisfy Low Approximate Regret can be made to do so for any choice of the approximation factor \u01eb via an appropriate selection of parameters. Many algorithms have an even stronger property: They satisfy (1) or (2) for all \u01eb > 0 simultaneously. We say that such algorithms satisfy the Strong Low Approximate Regret property. We shall see later that this property has favorable consequences in the context of repeated games.\nThe Low Approximate Regret property differs from previous properties (e.g. RVU) in that it only requires that the learner\u2019s cost be close to a multiplicative approximation to the cost of the best action in hindsight. We can generally achieve much lower regret relative to the multiplicative approximation, and which is significant because low regret implies fast convergence. For instance, if we consider only uniform (i.e. not data-dependent) regret bounds the Hedge algorithm can only achieve O( \u221a T log d) exact regret, but can achieve \u01eb-approximate regret of log d/\u01eb for any \u01eb. Remark. In Appendix D we show that the Low Approximate Regret property and our subsequent results naturally extend to utility maximization games."}, {"heading": "2.2 Smooth Games", "text": "It is well-known that in a large class of games, termed smooth games by Roughgarden [Rou15], traditional learning dynamics converge to approximately optimal social welfare. In subsequent sections we analyze the convergence of Low Approximate Regret learning dynamics in such smooth games. We will see that Low Approximate Regret (for sufficiently small A) coupled with smoothness of the game implies fast convergence of learning dynamics to desirable social welfare under a variety of conditions. Before proving this result we review social welfare and smooth games. For a given action profile s, the social cost is C(s) = \u2211n\ni=1 costi(s). To bound the efficiency loss due to the selfish behavior of the players, we compare to the optimal social cost that can be achieved by some centralized entity, i.e.\nOpt = min so\nn\u2211\ni=1\ncosti(s o).\nDefinition 2. (Smooth game [Rou15]) A cost minimization game is called (\u03bb, \u00b5)-smooth if for all strategy profiles s and s\u2217: \u2211 i costi(s \u2217 i , s\u2212i) \u2264 \u03bbcosti(s\u2217) + \u00b5costi(s). This property is typically applied using a (close to) optimal action profile s\u2217 = so. For this case the property implies that if s is an action profile with very high cost, then some player deviating to her share of the optimal profile s\u2217\ni will improve her cost.\nFor smooth games, the price of anarchy is at most \u03bb1\u2212\u00b5 , meaning that Nash equilibria of the game, as well as no-regret learning outcomes in the limit, have social cost at most a factor of \u03bb1\u2212\u00b5 above the optimum. Smooth cost minimization games include congestion games such as routing or load balancing. For example, atomic congestion games with affine cost functions are ( 53 , 1 3 )-smooth [CK05], non-atomic games are (1, 14 ) smooth [RT02], implying a price of anarchy of 2.5 and 1.33 respectively. Whilewe focus on cost-minimization games for simplicity of exposition, an analogous definition also applies for utility maximization, including smooth mechanisms [ST13], which we will elaborate on in Appendix D. Smooth mechanisms include most simple auctions. For example, the first price item auction is (1 \u2212 1/e, 1)-smooth and all-pay actions are (1/2, 1)-smooth, implying a price of anarchy of 1.58 and 2 respectively. All of our results extend to such mechanisms."}, {"heading": "3 Learning in Games with Full Information Feedback", "text": "We now analyze the efficiency of algorithms with the Low Approximate Regret property in our full information setting. Our first proposition shows that, for smooth games with full information feedback, learners with the Low Approximate Regret property converge to efficient outcomes. Proposition 1.

This proof is a straightforward modification of the usual price of anarchy proof for smooth games. We get the claimed bound by writing \u2211 tE [ C(st) ] = \u2211 i \u2211 t E [ costi(s t) ] ; using the Low Approximate Regret property with f = s\u2217 i for each player i for the optimal solution s\u2217; then using\nthe smoothness property for each time t to bound \u2211\ni costi(s \u2217 i , st\u2212i), and rearranging terms.\nNote that for \u01eb << (1 \u2212 \u00b5) the approximation factor of \u03bb/(1 \u2212 \u00b5 \u2212 \u01eb) is very close to the price of anarchy of \u03bb/(1 \u2212 \u00b5), showing that Low Approximate Regret learning quickly leads to outcomes with social welfare as high as the welfare of exact Nash equilibria. A simple corollary of this proposition is that when learners satisfy the Strong Low Approximate Regret property the bound above can be taken to depend on Opt, even though this value is unknown to the players.\nWhenever the Low Approximate Regret property is satisfied, a high probability version of the propertywith similar dependence on \u01eb andA is also satisfied (see Appendix A.1). This implies that in addition to quickly converging to efficient outcomes in expectation, Low Approximate Regret learners experience fast convergence in high probability. Proposition 2.

One would further hope that such algorithms are relatively simple and easy to find. We show now that the well-known Hedge algorithm as well as basic variants such as Optimistic Hedge and Hedge with online learning rate tuning satisfy the property with A = O(log d), which will lead to fast convergence both in terms of n and T. It is important to note that for all the algorithms considered in this paper, we can achieve the Low Approximate Regret property for any fixed \u01eb > 0 of choice for an appropriate parameter setting. In Appendix A.2, we provide full descriptions of these algorithms and proofs. Example 1. Hedge satisfies the Low Approximate Regret property with A(d,T) = log(d). In particular one can achieve the property for any fixed \u01eb > 0 by selecting an appropriate learning rate. Example 2. Hedge with online learning rate tuning satisfies the Strong Low Approximate Regret property with A(d,T) = 8 log(d). Example 3. Optimistic Hedge satisfies the Low Approximate Regret property with A(d,T) = 8 log(d). As with vanilla Hedge, we can choose the learning rate to achieve the property with any \u01eb. Example 4.

In contrast [SALS15] are only able to simultaneously show O ( n/ \u221a T ) individual regret and O(n3/T) convergence to price of anarchy.\nLow Approximate Regret algorithms only need realized feedback, whereas [SALS15] require expectation feedback. Having players receive expected feedback is unrealistic in terms of both information and computation. Indeed, even if the necessary information were available, computing expectations over discrete probability distributions is not tractable in the general case unless n is taken to be constant.\nOur results imply that Optimistic Hedge enjoys the best of two worlds: It enjoys fast convergence to the exact \u03bb1\u2212\u00b5 price of anarchy using expectation feedback as well as fast convergence to the \u01eb-approximate price of anarchy using realized feedback. Our new analysis of Optimistic Hedge ( Appendix A.2.2) sheds light on another desirable property of this algorithm: Its regret on any cost sequence is bounded in terms of the net cost the Hedge strategy would have produced, had it been selected on that sequence instead, meaning it will have good performance any time Hedge does.\nThe main differences between our results are summarized in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "4 Bandit Feedback", "text": "In many realistic scenarios, players of a game might not even know what they would have lost or gained if they had deviated from the action they played. We model this lack of information with bandit feedback, in which each player observes a single scalar costi(s\nt) = \u3008st i , ct i \u3009 per round. When the\ngame we consider is smooth, one can use the Low Approximate Regret property just as we did for the full information setting to show that players quickly converge to efficient solutions. Our results here hold with the same generality as in the full information setting: As long as learners satisfy the Low Approximate Regret property (1), Proposition 1 holds.\nIn contrast to the full information setting where the most common algorithm, Hedge, achieves Low Approximate Regret with competitive parameters, the most common adversarial bandit algorithm Exp3 does not seem to satisfy Low Approximate Regret. There are however known bandit algorithms that satisfy Low Approximate Regret, typically with A(d,T) = poly(d) log(T). For instance, [Sto05] provides the Exp3Light algorithm which has A(d,T) = d2 logT. The SCRiBLe algorithm introduced in [AHR08] (via the analysis in [RS13a]) enjoys the LowApproximate Regret property with A(d,T) = d3 log(dT). [AB10] provide a small loss bound for bandits which would be sufficient for Low Approximate Regret, but their strategy requires prior knowledge on the loss of the best expert (or a bound on it), which is not appropriate in our game setting. Similarly, the small loss bound in [Neu15] is not applicable in our setting as the work assumes oblivious adversary which is not the case in the games we consider.\nWe present a simple new bandit algorithm that achieves the Low Approximate Regret property with A(d,T) = d log(T/d), improving on the state of the art. Our algorithm uses a log barrier regularizer as in SCRiBLe, but uses classical importance sampling to produce unbiased estimates for cost vectors.\nAt each round the algorithm produces an importance weighted unbiased estimator of the costs: c\u0302t i [ j] = ct i [st i ]/wt i [st i ] when j = st i and c\u0302t i [ j] = 0 for j , st i . This estimator is used as the loss vector while\nperforming a Mirror Descent update with regularizer R(w) = \u2211\ni log(1/wi).\nWe bound the regret for mirror descent in terms of local norms as in [AHR08]. However, counter to earlier algorithms using log-barrier type functions we don\u2019t use the Dikin ellipsoid to perform exploration, and our analysis does not go through self-concordance. Insteadwe show that classical importanceweighted sampling approach, in fact, yields a favorable boundon the local normarising from the log barrier regularizer. The update step for our algorithm has the form:\n\u2200 j , st wt+1i [ j] = wt i [ j]\n1 + \u03b3wt i [ j]\n& wt+1i [s t] =\nwt i [st]\n1 + \u03b7ct i [st] + \u03b3wt i [st]\n(3)\nwhere \u03b3 < 0 is such that \u2211d\nj=1 w t+1 i [ j] = 1. This method can be implemented in O(d) time per round (using line search to find \u03b3). See Appendix B for a more detailed discussion. Lemma 5.

Theorem 6. Consider a (\u03bb, \u00b5)-smooth game. If all players use the learning algorithm proposed in Eq. 3 with learning rate \u03b7 = \u01eb/(1+ \u01eb), then\n1 T E\n  \u2211\nt\nC(st)   \u2264\n\u03bb 1 \u2212 \u00b5 \u2212 \u01ebOpt + n T \u00b7 1 1 \u2212 \u00b5 \u2212 \u01eb \u00b7 2(1 + \u01eb)d logT \u01eb .\nProof. Simply use the Low Approximate Regret property proved in Lemma 5 along with smoothness of the game. We obtain the final statement as in Proposition 1."}, {"heading": "5 Dynamic Population Games", "text": "In this section we consider the dynamic population repeated game setting introduced in [LST16]. Given a gameG as described in Section 2, a dynamic population gamewith stage gameG, is a repeated game where at each round t game G is played, and at each step, every player i is replaced by a new player with a turnover probability p. Concretely, when a player turns over, their strategy set and cost function are changed arbitrarily subject to the rules of the game. This models a repeated game setting where players have to adapt to an adversarially changing environment. We denote the cost function of player i at round t as costt\ni (\u00b7). As in Section 3, we assume that the players are\nreceiving full information feedback. That is, at the end of each round they observe the entire cost vector ct\ni = costt i (\u00b7, st\u2212i), and know their own cost function, but are not aware of the costs of the other\nplayers in the game.\nLearning in Dynamic Population Games and the Price of Anarchy To guarantee small overall cost, players need to exhibit low regret against a shifting benchmark that corresponds to the optimal social cost Optt = mins\u2217t \u2211 i cost t i (s\u2217t) at each step. With even a small probability p of change, the sequence of optimal solutions can have too many changes to be able to get low regret. In spite of this apparent difficulty, [LST16] prove that achieving at least a \u03c1\u03bb/(1\u2212\u00b5\u2212\u01eb) fraction of the optimal welfare is guaranteed if i) players are using low adaptive regret algorithms (see [HS09, LS15]) and ii) for the underlying optimization problem there exists a relatively stable sequence of solutions which at each step approximate the optimal solution by a factor of \u03c1. This holds as long as the turnover probability p is upper bounded by a function of \u01eb, as well as other terms depending on the game, such as the stability of the close to optimal solution.\nWe consider games with dynamic population where each player uses a learning algorithm satisfying Low Approximate Regret for shifting experts (2). This shifting version of Low Approximate Regret naturally implies a dynamic game analog of our main efficiency result, Proposition 1. We prove that a simple variation of Hedge which mixes the prediction weights at each step with a very small amount of uniform noise satisfies the Low Approximate Regret property for shifting experts with small A. Moreover, we show that all the algorithms that satisfy a small loss version of the adaptive regret property considered in [LST16] satisfy the Strong Low Approximate Regret property. This strengthens the results in [LST16] by both weakening the behavioral assumption on the players, allowing them to use much simpler learning algorithms, and allowing a higher turnover probability.\nWe first present the extension of Proposition 1 to the dynamic population game setting. Let s\u22171:T denote a sequence of near-optimal solutions s\u2217t, so that \u2211\ni cost t i (s\u2217t) \u2264 \u03c1Optt for all time steps t,\nwhere s\u2217t i \u2208 \u2206(Si), the action of each player i in s\u2217t, may be randomized.\nWe use Ki to denote the random variable of the number of changes of strategies in player i in the strategy sequence s\u22171:T. The stability of a sequence of solutions is determined by the expected number of changes that occur in it, i.e. E[ \u2211 i Ki]. Theorem 7. (PoA with Dynamic Population) If all players use a Low Approximate Regret algorithm satisfying (2) in a dynamic population game, where the stage game is (\u03bb, \u00b5)-smooth game, and Ki denotes the number of changes of strategies in player i in a sequence s\u22171:T of \u03c1-approximately minimum cost solution,\nthen 1\nT\n\u2211\nt\nE [ C(st) ] \u2264 1\nT \u03bb \u00b7 \u03c1 1 \u2212 \u00b5 \u2212 \u01eb\n\u2211\nt\nE [ Optt ] +\nn + E [\u2211 i Ki ]\nT \u00b7 1 1 \u2212 \u00b5 \u2212 \u01eb \u00b7 A(d,T) \u01eb , (4)\nwhere expectation is taken over the random turnover in the population playing the game, as well as the random choices of the players on the left hand side.\nThis result follows from using s\u22171:T i\n\u2013 the action sequence of player i in the stable solution \u2013 as the shifting comparator in the Low Approximate Regret inequality, and then applying smoothness. See the proof in Appendix C.1. We can also extend this theorem to guarantee a high probability bound, analogous to the proof of Proposition 2.\nTo claim a price of anarchy bound, we need to make sure that the additive term in (4) is a small fraction of the optimal cost. The challenge here is that high turnover probability p reduces stability, increasing E [\u2211 i Ki ] . By using algorithms with smaller A, we can allow for higher E [\u2211 i Ki ] and hence higher turnover probability.\nAlgorithms with Low Approximate Regret for Shifting Experts A variant of the basic Hedge algorithmwith a small uniform noise added to its predictions, whichwe termNoisy Hedge, satisfies Low Approximate Regret for shifting experts with A = O\u0303(1). Letting wt be the Hedge distribution and \u03c0 be the uniform distribution, Noisy Hedge predicts according to (1\u2212\u03b8)wt+\u03b8\u03c0with \u03b8 at most O(1/T) in our applications. Proposition 8. Noisy Hedge with a constant learning rate \u03b7t = \u01eb satisfies the Low Approximate Regret property for shifting experts with A(d,T) = log(dT) + 1.\nProof of this proposition and details on the algorithm are in Appendix C.2. A similar result can be proven for a noisy version of Optimistic Hedge. In addition, all learning algorithms satisfying the small loss version of the adaptive regret property of [HS09] have low approximate regret with shifting experts.\nIn their results for dynamic population games, [LST16] use the AdaNormalHedge algorithm of [LS15]. Thismore complex algorithm satisfies the adaptive regret property of [HS09], but hasO(dT) space complexity. In contrast Noisy Hedge is as simple as Hedge, and requires space complexity of just O(d).\nResults in Dynamic Population Games Using Theorem 7 with Low Approximate Regret algorithms such as Noisy Hedge that have A(d,T) = log(dT) improves the turnover rate p in the results of [LST16].\nLet \u03ba denote the expected number of players whose strategy in s\u22171:T changes as one player turns over, so E [\u2211 i Ki ] = pnT\u03ba, as each step pn players turn over in expectation. The parameter \u03ba as defined here depends on the concrete game; it is a parameter of a high stability approximate optimization method used as in [LST16]. Let \u03b3 > 0 be a lower bound on the average cost of each player, at each time step, giving a lower bound on the optimum cost of \u2211\nt E\n[ Optt ] \u2265 \u03b3nT.\nUsing these two parameters, [LST16] show a price of anarchy bound of \u03bb\u03c1/(1 \u2212 \u00b5 \u2212 \u01eb), assuming the turnover probability p \u2264 \u01eb2\u03b32/(\u03ba log(dT)). Using Theorem 7 we get the same price of anarchy bound, yet allow higher turnover probability by a factor of 1/\u03b3: p \u2264 \u01eb2\u03b3/(\u03ba log(dT)).\nAs an illustrative example of the improvement, consider matching markets. Suppose n players are each bidding in first price item auction for one of many items (the winner paying her own bid for each item). Suppose vi j, the player i\u2019s value for item j is in the range of vi j \u2208 [\u03b3, 1], and the players are unit-demand, bidding to win one high value items at low price. In this mechanism, we will use SW(s) to denote the social welfare achieved by action profile s, the sum of player utilities plus the auctioneer\u2019s revenue, and use Optt is the maximum social welfare possible with players in round t.\nFirst price item auction is a (1\u22121/e, 1) smooth mechanism, hence has a price of anarchy of e/(e\u22121) \u2248 1.58. Lykouris et al [LST16] prove that a price of anarchy of 1.58(1 + \u03b7) is guaranteed if players use adaptive learning and the turnover probability is at most p \u2264 \u03b32/(log(dT) log(1/\u03b3)). Using the proof from [LST16] with the improved A(d,T) term of Proposition 8, we get an \u03b3\u22121 improvement in the probability term: Theorem 9. If all players use a Low Approximate Regret algorithm satisfying (2) in a dynamic population matching market with first price item auctions, then\n1.58(1+ \u03b7) \u2211\nt\nE [ SW(st) ] \u2265 \u2211\nt\nE [ Optt ] (5)\nassuming the turnover probability p is at most p \u2264 \u03b3/(log(dT) log(1/\u03b3)). Considering other games and mechanisms [LST16], we get analogously improved version of all of them, including congestion games, bandwidth-sharing, as well as large markets."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The authors would like to thank Vasilis Syrgkanis for sharing his simulation software and for helpful discussions."}, {"heading": "APPENDIX", "text": ""}, {"heading": "A Proofs from Section 3", "text": ""}, {"heading": "A.1 Proof of Proposition 2", "text": "To get the with high probability bounds we will need to use a concentration bound.

A simple example of such a mechanism is the first price auction: The player\u2019s strategy is a bid, the highest bidder wins the item, and pays her own bid.\nWe use the the smooth mechanism definition of [ST13].2 Definition 3. (Smooth mechanism [ST13]) A utility maximization mechanism is called (\u03bb, \u00b5)-smooth if there exists a strategy profile s\u2217, such that for all strategy profiles s: \u2211 i ui(s \u2217 i , s\u2212i) \u2265 \u03bbOpt\u2212\u00b5 \u2211 i pi(s), where\nOpt = maxso \u2211n i=1 utilityi(s o).\nRecall from section 2 that first price item auctions are (1\u22121/e, 1)-smooth, all-pay actions are (1/2, 1)- smooth, and smooth mechanisms have a price of anarchy of at most max(\u00b5, 1)/\u03bb, as we will show in Proposition 16. Remark 1. Note the slight difference in the definition to the one we used for smoothness in games. In proving the price of anarchy property we used the game smoothness property with s\u2217 being the action profile resulting in Opt total cost. In the above definition for mechanisms, we do not insist that SW(s\u2217) = Opt.\nThe natural extension of the low approximate regret property for utility maximization is the following: Definition 4. (Low Approximate Regret for utility maximization) A learning algorithm that uses action distributions wt\ni in step t satisfies the LowApproximateRegret property\nfor a parameter \u01eb, and a function A if for all action distributions f \u2208 \u2206(Si):\n(1 + \u01eb)\nT\u2211\nt=1\n\u3008wti , u t i\u3009 \u2265\nT\u2211\nt=1\n\u3008 f , uti\u3009 \u2212 A(d,T)\n\u01eb . (27)\n2For the dynamic population game setting, we use a variant of this definition, solution-based smoothnesswhere Opt in the RHS is replaced by the social welfare of a near-optimal solution as in [LST16].\nAnalgorithm satisfies LowApproximateRegret for the shifting experts setting if for all sequences f 1, . . . , f T \u2208 \u2206(Si), letting K be the number of shifts, i.e. K = |{t > 2 : f t\u22121 , f t}|:\n(1 + \u01eb)\nT\u2211\nt=1\n\u3008wti , u t i\u3009 \u2265\nT\u2211\nt=1\n\u3008 f t, uti\u3009 \u2212 (1 + K) A(d,T)\n\u01eb . (28)\nWe say that an algorithm satisfies the strong Low Approximate Regret property if it satisfies (27) or (28) for all \u01eb > 0 simultaneously. In the bandit feedback case, we require the property to hold in expectations over the realized strategies of player i.\nNow we are ready to prove the utility maximization analog of Proposition 1 Proposition 16. (Mechanisms PoA in expectation) Consider a (\u03bb, \u00b5)-smooth mechanism. If all players use Low Approximate Regret algorithms satisfying Eq. (27) for some parameter \u01eb, then\n1\nT\n\u2211\nt\nE [ SW(st) ] \u2265 \u03bb\nmax(\u00b5, 1 + \u01eb) Opt +\nn T \u00b7 1 max(\u00b5, 1 + \u01eb) \u00b7 A(d,T) \u01eb .\nwhere st is the action profile drawn on round t from the corresponding mixed actions of the players.\nProof. We get the claimed bound by considering (1 + \u01eb) \u2211\ntE [\u2211 i utilityi(s t) ] ; using the low approx-\nimate regret property with f = s\u2217 i for each player i for the action s\u2217in the smoothness property;\nthen using the smoothness property for each time t to bound \u2211\ni utilityi(s \u2217 i , st\u2212i), and rearranging\nterms.\nFollowing, we show how we can get the Low Approximate Regret property for Hedge. Proposition 17. Hedge with a constant learning rate and uniform prior over actions satisfies the utility version of the Low Approximate Regret property with A(d,T) = (e \u2212 1) log(d). We mirror the proof of Proposition 12 with ct = \u2212ut. The only place where the analysis does not automatically go through is where we need that the costs are in [0, 1], namely relation 10. Note that the first inequality there ceases to hold when ct < 0. However it is still the case that 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b7x \u2264 (e \u2212 1)\u03b7x for x \u2208 [\u22121, 0]. Hence we have:\n\u3008wt \u2212 w\u0303t+1, ct\u3009 \u2264 \u03b7(e \u2212 1) \u2211\nj\u2208[d] wtj(c t j) 2 \u2264 \u03b7(e \u2212 1)\n\u2211 j\u2208[d] wtj(\u2212c t j).\nThe last inequality holds as \u2212ct j \u2208 [0, 1]. From this, combined with the rest of the proof in Proposition 12, we have: \u2211\nt\u3008wt \u2212 f , ct\u3009 \u2264 \u03b7(e \u2212 1) \u2211 t\u3008wt,\u2212ct\u3009 + log(d) \u03b7 . Setting \u01eb = \u03b7(e \u2212 1) and substituting ct yields\n(1 + \u01eb)\nT\u2211\nt=1\n\u3008wt, ut\u3009 \u2265 T\u2211\nt=1\n\u3008 f , ut\u3009 \u2212 (e \u2212 1) log(d)\n\u01eb .\nwhich proves the claim.\nThe same idea can be applied in all the other proofs we have and one can verify that all our results for cost minimization games extend to utility maximization mechanisms."}], "references": [{"title": "Regret bounds and minimax policies under partial monitoring", "author": ["Jean-Yves Audibert", "S\u00e9bastien Bubeck"], "venue": "The Journal of Machine Learning Research,", "citeRegEx": "Audibert and Bubeck.,? \\Q2010\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Audibert and Bubeck.", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Adaptive and self-confident on-line learning algorithms", "author": ["Peter Auer", "Nicolo Cesa-Bianchi", "Claudio Gentile"], "venue": "Journal of Computer and System Sciences,", "citeRegEx": "Auer et al\\.,? \\Q2002\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Auer et al\\.", "year": 2002}, {"title": "Competing in the dark: An efficient algorithm for bandit linear optimization", "author": ["Jacob Abernethy", "Elad Hazan", "Alexander Rakhlin"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 21st Annual Conference on Learning Theory (COLT),", "citeRegEx": "Abernethy et al\\.,? \\Q2008\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Abernethy et al\\.", "year": 2008}, {"title": "High-probability regret bounds for bandit online linear optimization", "author": ["Peter L Bartlett", "Varsha Dani", "Thomas Hayes", "Sham Kakade", "Alexander Rakhlin", "Ambuj Tewari"], "venue": "In Proceedings of 21st Annual Conference on Learning Theory (COLT),", "citeRegEx": "Bartlett et al\\.,? \\Q2008\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bartlett et al\\.", "year": 2008}, {"title": "Prediction, Learning, and Games", "author": ["Nicolo Cesa-Bianchi", "Gabor Lugosi"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Cesa.Bianchi and Lugosi.,? \\Q2006\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Cesa.Bianchi and Lugosi.", "year": 2006}, {"title": "Improved second-order bounds for prediction with expert advice", "author": ["Nicolo Cesa-Bianchi", "Yishay Mansour", "Gilles Stoltz"], "venue": "Machine Learning,", "citeRegEx": "Cesa.Bianchi et al\\.,? \\Q2007\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Cesa.Bianchi et al\\.", "year": 2007}, {"title": "The price of anarchy of finite congestion games", "author": ["Giorgos Christodoulou", "Elias Koutsoupias"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 37th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC),", "citeRegEx": "Christodoulou and Koutsoupias.,? \\Q2005\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Christodoulou and Koutsoupias.", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Near-optimal no-regret algorithms for zero-sum games", "author": ["Constantinos Daskalakis", "Alan Deckelbaum", "Anthony Kim"], "venue": "Games and Economic Behavior,", "citeRegEx": "Daskalakis et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Daskalakis et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Adaptive online learning", "author": ["Dylan J Foster", "Alexander Rakhlin", "Karthik Sridharan"], "venue": "In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,", "citeRegEx": "Foster et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Foster et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "A decision-theoretic generalization of on-line learning and an application to boosting", "author": ["Yoav Freund", "Robert E Schapire"], "venue": "J.

Our property, which simply requires that each learner has small regret compared to a (1 + \u01eb)-multiplicative approximation to the best action in hindsight, is ubiquitous among learning algorithms \u2014 it is satisfied evenby the vanillaHedge forecaster. Our results improveupon recentwork of Syrgkanis et al. [SALS15] in a number of ways. We improve upon the speed of convergence by a factor of n, the number of players, and require only that the players observe payoffs under other players\u2019 realized actions, as opposed to expected payoffs. We further show that convergence occurs with high probability, and under certain conditions show convergence under bandit feedback. Both the scope of settings and the class of algorithms for which our analysis provides fast convergence are considerably broader than in previous work. Our framework applies to dynamic population games via a low approximate regret property for shifting experts. Here we strengthen the results of [LST16] in two ways: We allow players to select learning algorithms from a larger class, which includes a minor variant of the basic Hedge algorithm, and we increase the maximum churn in players for which approximate optimality is achieved. In the bandit setting we present a novel algorithm which provides a \u201csmall loss\u201d-type bound with improved dependence on the number of actions and is both simple and efficient.
