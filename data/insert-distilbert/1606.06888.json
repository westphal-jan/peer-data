Examples include games such as poker [24] and security settings [8]. In strictly competitive sequential games in which the environment can be influenced through actions, the problem of behaving rationally can be modeled as a zero-sum Partially Observable Stochastic Game (zs-POSG).\nReasoning about zs-POSGs poses a challenge for strategic agents: they need to reason about their own uncertainty regarding the state of the environment as well as uncertainty regarding the opposing agent. As this opponent is trying to minimize the reward that they are maximizing, behaving strategically typically requires stochastic strategies. A factor that further complicates the reasoning is that agents not only influence their immediate rewards, but also the future state of the environment and both agents\u2019 future observations.\nIn this paper, we prove the existence of structural properties of zsPOSGs, that may be exploited to make reasoning about these models more tractable. We take inspiration from recent work for collaborative settings which has shown that it is possible to summarize the past joint policy using so called plan-time sufficient statistics [15], which\n1 Scyfer B.V., email: auke@scyfer.nl 2 University of Liverpool, Universiteit van Amsterdam, email:\nFrans.Oliehoek@liverpool.ac.uk 3 University of Oxford, email: diederik.roijers@cs.ox.ac.uk\ncan be interpreted as the belief of a special type of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to which the collaborative Decentralized POMDP can be reduced [3, 10, 14]. This enabled tackling these problems using solution methods for POMDPs, leading to increases in scalability [3].\nThis paper provides a theoretical basis for enabling similar advancements for zs-POSGs. In particular, we extend results for DecPOMDPs to the zs-POSG setting by presenting three contributions:\n1. Two novel formulations of the value functions in POSGs, one based on past joint policies, and one based on distributions of information in the game called plan-time sufficient statistics. 2. A proof that the latter formulation allows for a generalization over the statistics: on every stage, the value function exhibits concavity and convexity in different subspaces of statistic space. 3. A reduction of the zs-POSG to a Non-Observable Stochastic Game, which in turn allows us to shows that certain properties previously proven for narrower classes of games generalize to the more general zs-POSG considered here.\nThis is the first work that gives insight in how the value function of a zs-POSG generalizes over the space of sufficient statistics. We argue that this result may open up the route for new solution methods."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "In this section we provide the necessary background to explain our contributions. We defer a treatment of related work to Section 6, where we can more concisely point out the differences to our work.\nThis paper focuses on zero-sum games of incomplete information where the number of states, actions, observations and the horizon are finite. We examine games where the hidden state is static, and games with dynamic state (i.e., it changes over time). We assume perfect recall, i.e., agents recall their own past actions and observations, and assume that all elements of the game are common knowledge among the agents [19, Chapter 5]."}, {"heading": "2.1 Zero-Sum One-Shot Games", "text": "We start by describing one-shot (static) games.\nDefinition 1. A normal form game (NFG) is a tuple N = \u3008I,A,R\u3009:\n\u2022 I = {1, 2} is the set of 2 agents, \u2022 A = A1 \u00d7A2 is the set of joint actions a = \u3008a1, a2\u3009, also called\n(joint) strategies, \u2022 R = {R1, R2} is the set of reward (or \u2018payoff\u2019) functions for the\nagents: Ri : A \u2192 R is the reward function for agent i,\nIn the case of a zero-sum NFG (zs-NFG), we have that R1(a) = \u2212R2(a),\u2200a. In a zs-NFG, we will define the following quantities (and the associated strategies):\nDefinition 2. The maxmin value (for agent 1) of a 2 player zerosum game is defined as Vmaxmin(N ) = maxa1 mina2 R1(a1, a2).\nDefinition 3. The minmax value (for agent 1) of a 2 player zerosum game is defined as Vminmax(N ) = mina2 maxa1 R1(a1, a2).\nThe min-max theorem states that \u2200N Vmaxmin(N ) \u2264 Vminmax(N ) [2]. In case of equality, we say that V (N ) = Vmaxmin(N ) = Vminmax(N ) is the value of the game.\nA Nash Equilibrium (NE) is a joint strategy from which no agent has an incentive to unilaterally deviate. In zs-NFGs, if an NE exists, then it coincides with the value of the game. That is, the value of a game is the value attained when both agents follow the strategy specified by the NE. Moreover any NEs, also called saddle points in this context, correspond to maxmin-strategies for the players [19, Proposition 22.2]. We will refer to such strategies as rational strategies.\nThe value is not guaranteed to exist in all zs-NFGs. If the action sets are convex and compact, if \u2200a2, the mapping a1 \u2192 R1(a1, a2) is a concave function, and if \u2200a1, a2 \u2192 R1(a1, a2) is a convex function, then the value exists and the zs-NFG has a Nash equilibrium (i.e., a saddle point) [1, p. 134], [19, Proposition 20.3]. In games where actions are discrete, an NE (and corresponding value) may not exist. However, when mixed strategies are allowed, we can convert to a continuous action NFG: \u3008I,M1 \u00d7 M2,R\u2032\u3009, where \u00b5i \u2208 Mi specifies a probability distribution over actions, and where R\u2032i(\u00b51, \u00b52) = \u2211\na1 \u00b51(a1)\n\u2211\na2 \u00b52(a2)Ri(a1, a2). Furthermore, it\ncan now be shown that the utility function R\u2032(\u00b51, \u00b52) in terms of mixed strategies is concave in \u00b51 for each \u00b52, and convex in \u00b52 for each \u00b51, such that the aforementioned assumptions needed for the existence of a saddle-point hold (i.e., an NE exists [2, p.239])."}, {"heading": "2.2 Zero-Sum Bayesian Games", "text": "Here we consider zero-sum Bayesian Games (zs-BGs), in which agents simultaneously select an action based on an individual observation (often referred to as their type).\nDefinition 4. A zs-BG is defined as a tuple B = \u3008I,\u0398,A, R, \u03c3\u3009:\n\u2022 I = {1, 2} is the set of 2 agents, \u2022 \u0398 = \u03981 \u00d7\u03982 is the finite set of joint types \u03b8 = \u3008\u03b81, \u03b82\u3009, \u2022 A = A1 \u00d7A2 is the finite set of joint actions a = \u3008a1, a2\u3009, \u2022 R : \u0398\u00d7A \u2192 R is the reward function for agent 1, \u2022 \u03c3 \u2208 \u2206(\u0398) is the probability distribution over joint types.\nIn this paper we treat finite zs-BGs, where the sets of actions and types are finite. A pure strategy, to which we refer as a pure decision rule, is a mapping from types to actions. A stochastic decision rule \u03b4i \u2208 \u2206Si is a mapping from types to probability distributions over the set of actions, denoted as \u03b4i(ai|\u03b8i), \u2206Si is the space of such mappings. Given a joint decision rule \u03b4 = \u3008\u03b41, \u03b42\u3009, the value is:\nQBG(B, \u03b4) , \u2211\n\u03b8\n\u03c3(\u03b8) \u2211\na\n\u03b4(a|\u03b8)R(\u03b8, a). (1)\nwhere \u03b4(a|\u03b8) , \u03b41(a1|\u03b81)\u03b42(a2|\u03b82). The case of pure decision rules is covered by treating them as degenerate stochastic policies.\nThere are two ways to reduce a zs-BG to a zs-NFG. First, we can simply reinterpret QBG(B, \u03b4) as a payoff function R(\u03b41, \u03b42), such\nthat the BG corresponds to an NFG with continuous action sets \u2206Si for each player i. The conditions for the existence of the value for such a game can be shown to hold, so if we suppose that \u3008\u03b4\u22171 , \u03b4 \u2217 2\u3009 is an NE, then the value of the game can be defined as the maxmin (=minmax) value:\nVBG(B) , QBG(B, \u3008\u03b4 \u2217 1 , \u03b4 \u2217 2\u3009) =\nmax \u03b41\u2208\u2206 S 1 min \u03b42\u2208\u2206 S 2 QBG(B, \u3008\u03b41, \u03b42\u3009) = min \u03b42\u2208\u2206 S 2 max \u03b41\u2208\u2206 S 1 QBG(B, \u3008\u03b41, \u03b42\u3009). (2)\nAlternatively, one can reinterpret the BG as an NFG with finite action sets corresponding to the pure decision rules. This then leads to a similar R\u2032(\u00b51, \u00b52) formulation where the mixed strategies \u00b5i now are distributions over pure decision rules. Again this formulation will satisfy the required assumptions on concavity/convexity, such that this reinterpretation leads to the same logical conclusion that the value of the finite zs-BG exists (these dual perspectives are possible due to the one-one correspondence between stochastic decision rules and mixed strategies).\nThese reductions imply that solution methods for zs-NFGs (e.g., via linear programming [25]) can be used to solve zs-BGs. However, such an approach does not scale well \u2014 a more efficient solution method is to convert the zs-BG to sequence form [9]."}, {"heading": "2.3 Zero-sum POSGs", "text": "A zero-sum Partially Observable Stochastic Game (zs-POSG) is a model for multi-agent decision making under uncertainty in zerosum sequential games where the state changes over time, and the agents simultaneously choose actions at every stage.\nDefinition 5. A finite zs-POSG is defined as a tuple P = \u3008h, I,S ,A,O, T, O,R, b0\u3009:\n\u2022 h is the horizon, \u2022 I = {1, 2} is the set of 2 agents, \u2022 S is the finite set of states s, \u2022 A = A1 \u00d7A2 is the finite set of joint actions a = \u3008a1, a2\u3009, \u2022 O = O1 \u00d7O2 is the finite set of joint observations o = \u3008o1, o2\u3009, \u2022 T is the transition function Pr(st+1|st, at), \u2022 O is the observation function Pr(ot+1|st+1, at), \u2022 R : S \u00d7A\u00d7 S \u2192 R is the reward function for agent 1, \u2022 b0 \u2208 \u2206(S) is the probability distribution over states.\nIn the zs-POSG, we aim to find maxmin-strategies and corresponding value. Let a pure policy for agent i be a mapping from individual action-observation histories (AOHs) ~\u03b8ti = \u3008a0i , o 1 i , . . . , a t\u22121 i , o t i\u3009 to actions. Let a stochastic policy for agent i be a mapping from individual AOHs to a probability distribution over actions, denoted as \u03c0i(ati|~\u03b8 t i). An individual policy defines action selection of one agent on every stage of the game, and is essentially a sequence of individual decision rules \u03c0i = \u3008\u03b40i . . . \u03b4 h\u22121 i \u3009. We define the past individual policy as a tuple of decision rules \u03d5ti = \u3008\u03b40i , . . . , \u03b4 t\u22121 i \u3009, and define the tuple containing decision rules from stage t to h as the partial individual policy \u03c0ti = \u3008\u03b4 t i , . . . , \u03b4 h\u22121 i \u3009.\nAs in zs-BGs, it is theoretically possible to convert a zs-POSG to a zs-NFG and solve using standard methods, but this is infeasible in practice. An alternative is to converting the zs-POSG to an extensive form game (EFG) and solve it in sequence form [9]. While this is more efficient than the NFG route, it is still intractable: the resulting EFG is huge since its size depends on the number of full histories (trajectories of joint actions, joint observations, and states) [18].\nWith the goal of opening paths to completely new approaches of tackling zs-POSGs, this paper focuses on the description of the value function of zs-POSGs, which (in contrast to the value of a game as defined above) is a function mapping from some notion of \u2018state\u2019 of a game to the expected value (for agent 1). Similar to how the \u2018value\u2019 is defined by rational strategies, we will use the term \u2018value function\u2019 for a function that captures the future expected rewards under a rational joint policy. However, since one can also reason about the value of non-rational policies, we will refer to the \u2018rational value function\u2019 if there is a need to clarify."}, {"heading": "3 Structure in One-Shot Value", "text": "In order to provide a value function definition for the sequential setting (in Section 4), we will rely on an intermediate result for one-shot games developed in this section.

Intuitively, different stages t of a POSG are similar to a BG: each agent has a privately observed history, which corresponds to its type. However, the probabilities of these histories might depend on how the game was played in earlier stages. As such, we will need to reason about families of BGs.\nDefinition 6. A Family of Bayesian Games, F = \u3008I,\u0398,A, R\u3009, is the set of Bayesian Games of the form \u3008I,\u0398,A, R, \u03c3\u3009 for which I,\u0398,A and R are identical.\nLet F be a Family of zero-sum Bayesian Games.

(7)\nWe remind the reader that, for each \u03c3, QF(\u03c3, \u3008\u03b41, \u03b42\u3009) exhibits concavity and convexity in the space of decision rules, as discussed in Section 2.2."}, {"heading": "3.2 Concavity/Convexity of the Value Function", "text": "We saw in the previous section that the concave/convex shape of the utility function expressed in the space of decision rules follows di-\nrectly from known results. Here we provide a novel result: V \u2217F exhibits a similar concave/convex shape in terms of type distributions. This is important, as it provides insight on how the distribution of information (in addition to the distribution of actions) affects the value of the game, which is key to enabling generalization of the value in different parts of sequential games. To provide this formulation, we decompose \u03c3 into a marginal term \u03c3m,i and a conditional term \u03c3c,i, here shown for i = 1:\n\u03c3m,1(\u03b81) , \u2211\n\u03b82\u2208\u03982\n\u03c3(\u03b81\u03b82), \u03c3c,1(\u03b82|\u03b81) , \u03c3(\u03b81\u03b82)\n\u03c3m,1(\u03b81) .

Using this result, we prove that V \u2217F exhibits concavity in \u2206(\u03981) for every \u03c3c,1, and convexity in \u2206(\u03982) for every \u03c3c,2.

(14)\nWe use (14) to find rational decision rules for both agents. Consistent with (13), we show how to find \u03b4t+1\u2217 = \u3008\u03b4t+1\u22171 , \u03b4 t+1\u2217 2 \u3009:\n\u03b4 t+1\u2217 1 = argmax\n\u03b4 t+1 1 \u2208\u2206S 1\nmin \u03b4 t+1 2 \u2208\u2206S 2\nQ \u2217 t+1(\u03d5 t+1 , \u3008\u03b4t+11 , \u03b4 t+1 2 \u3009), (15)\n\u03b4 t+1\u2217 2 = argmin\n\u03b4 t+1 2 \u2208\u2206S 2\nmax \u03b4 t+1 1 \u2208\u2206S 1\nQ \u2217 t+1(\u03d5 t+1 , \u3008\u03b4t+11 , \u03b4 t+1 2 \u3009). (16)\nUsing (12), (15) and (16), a rational joint decision rule \u03b4h\u22121\u2217 can be found by performing a maxminimization over immediate reward. Evaluation of Q\u2217h\u22121(\u03d5 t, \u03b4h\u22121\u2217) gives us the value at stage t = h \u2212\n1, and (13) propagates the value to the preceding stages. As such, rationality for all stages follows by induction. The value function can now be defined in terms of the past joint policy as:\nV \u2217 t (\u03d5 t) = max \u03b4t 1 \u2208\u2206S 1 min \u03b4t 2 \u2208\u2206S 2 Q \u2217 t (\u03d5 t , \u3008\u03b4t1, \u03b4 t 2\u3009). (17)\nBy (12), (15) and (16), \u03b4t\u2217 is dependent on \u03b4t+1\u2217, and thus on the rational future joint policy. However, \u03b4t+1\u2217 can only be found if past joint policy \u03d5t+1, which includes \u03b4t, is known. As such, (17) can not be used to form a backward inductive approach directly."}, {"heading": "4.2 Plan-Time Sufficient Statistics", "text": "A disadvantage of the value function definition from the previous section is that the value at a stage t depends on all the joint decisions from stage 0 to t.

The plan-time sufficient statistic for a general past joint policy \u03d5t, assuming b0 is known, is a distribution over joint AOHs: \u03c3t(~\u03b8t) , Pr(~\u03b8t|b0, \u03d5t).\nIn the collaborative Dec-POMDP case, a plan-time sufficient statistic fully captures the influence of the past joint policy. We prove that this also holds for the zs-POSG case, thereby validating the previous definition and the name \u2018sufficient statistic\u2018. We aim to express the value for a given decision rule \u03b4t in terms of a plan-time sufficient statistic, given that the agents act rationally at later stages.

As we will show, each segment corresponds exactly to a best-response value function.\nBest-response value functions in terms of \u03c3t and \u03c0ti are defined as V BR1t and V BR2 t , similar to (6) and (7).

We know the zs-POSG value function at stage t = h \u2212 1 to be equivalent to that of a Family of zs-BGs, which is concave/convex (Lemma 1). This is a base case for the proof. The full proof is listed in Appendix A.\nTheorem 2. V \u2217t is (1) concave in \u2206(~\u0398 t 1) for a given \u03c3 t c,1, and (2) convex in \u2206(~\u0398t2) for a given \u03c3 t c,2.

Thus, it may enable the development of new solution methods for zs-POSGs. To draw the parallel, many POMDP solution methods exploit the fact that a POMDP value function is piecewise-linear and convex (PWLC) in belief-space [20, 27] (which is similar to the statistic-space we consider), and recently\nsuch results have been extended to the decentralized cooperative (i.e., Dec-POMDP) case [3, 10].\nNote that our result is similar to, but different from the saddlepoint function that is typically associated with min-max equilibria. In particular, the value function in is defined in the space of plantime sufficient statistics, while the well-known saddle point function (see Section 2.1) is a function of complete strategies. This means that the latter is only defined for the reduction to a normal form game, which per definition destroys any of the specific structure of the game under concern. In contrast, our formulation preserves such structure and thus allows us to make statements about how value generalizes as a function of the information distribution. That is, the formulation allows us to give approximation bounds that generalize within each conditional statistic."}, {"heading": "5 Reduction to NOSG", "text": "The application of methods that exploit the PWLC structure of the value function of Dec-POMDPs was enabled by a reduction from Dec-POMDP to a non-observable MDP (NOMDP), which is a special type of (centralized) POMDP [3, 10, 14, 16]. This allows POMDP solution methods to be employed in the context of DecPOMDPs. The proposed plan-time statistics for Dec-POMDPs [15] precisely correspond to the belief in the centralized model.\nSince we have shown that it is possible to generalize the plantime statistics to the zs-POSG case, it is reasonable to expect that zsPOSGs can be reduced similarly. Here we present a reduction from zs-POSG to a special type of stochastic game where information is centralized, to which we refer as a Non-Observable Stochastic Game (NOSG). We do not provide the full background of the reduction for the Dec-POMDP case, but refer to [16]. The difference between the reduction from Dec-POMDP to NOMDP and the one we present next, is that the zs-POSG is reduced to a stochastic game where the joint AOH acts as the state.\nDefinition 8. A plan-time Non-Observable Stochastic Game for a zs-POSG is a tuple \u3008S\u0307, A\u03071, A\u03071, O\u0307, T\u0307, O\u0307, R\u0307, b\u03070\u3009:\n\u2022 I = {1, 2} is the set of agents, \u2022 S\u0307 is the set of augmented states s\u0307t, each corresponding to a joint\nAOH ~\u03b8t, \u2022 A\u0307 = A\u03071\u00d7A\u03072 is the continuous action-space, containing stochas-\ntic decision rules \u03b4t = \u3008\u03b4t1, \u03b4 t 2\u3009,\n\u2022 O\u0307 = {NULL} is set of joint observations that only contains the NULL observation. \u2022 T\u0307 is the transition function that specifies T\u0307 (s\u0307t+1 | s\u0307t, \u3008a\u0307t1, a\u0307 t 2\u3009) =\nPr(~\u03b8t+1 | ~\u03b8t, \u3008\u03b4t1, \u03b4 t 2\u3009).\n\u2022 O\u0307 is the observation function that specifies that observation NULL is received with probability 1. \u2022 R\u0307 : S\u0307 \u00d7A \u2192 R is the reward function R(~\u03b8t, \u3008\u03b4t1, \u03b4 t 2\u3009), \u2022 b\u03070 \u2208 \u2206(S\u0307) is the initial belief over states.\nIn the NOSG model, agents condition their choices on the joint belief over augmented states b\u0307 \u2208 \u2206(S\u0307), which corresponds to the belief over joint AOHs captured in the statistic \u03c3t \u2208 \u2206(\u0398t). As such, a value function formulation for the NOSG can be given in accordance with (24).\nIn order to avoid potential confusion, let us point out that a zsPOSG can also be converted to a best response POMDP by fixing the policies of one agent [12], which leads to a model where the information state b(s, \u03b8j) is a distribution over states and AOHs of the other agent. In contrast, our NOSG formulation maintains a belief\nover only joint AOHs. More importantly, however, our approach does not require fixing the policy of any agent, which would necessitate recomputing of all values when the fixed policy changes (if the past policy changes, the distributions over paths change, and thus future values are affected). Where the approach of Nair et al. [12] leads to a single-agent model that can be used to compute a best-response, our conversion leads to a multi-agent model that can be used to compute a Nash equilibrium directly.\nA key contribution of our NOSG formulation is that it directly indicates that properties of \u2018zero-sum stochastic games with shared observations\u2019 [5] also hold for zs-POSGs.\nDefinition 9. A zero-sum Shared Observation Stochastic Game (zs-SOSG) is a zs-POSG (cf. Def. 5) in which each agent receives the joint observation and can observe the other\u2019s actions.\nGhosh et al. [5] show that, under some technical assumptions, a zsSOSG can be converted into a completely observable model (similar to the conversion of a POMDP into a belief MDP), and that, in the infinite-horizon case, both the value and a rational joint policy exists.\nOur claim is that these results in fact transfer to the more general class of zs-POSGs via our NOSG construction. We start by noting:\nLemma 4. The plan-time NOSG of a finite-horizon zs-POSG is a zs-SOSG.\nProof. In the finite-horizon case, the set of states in our plan-time NOSG is discrete. The action space, while continuous, is of finite dimensionality, and is a closed and bounded set. The set of shared observations only consists of a trivial NULL observation and by assuming rationality for both players, we can assume that they observe each others actions (corresponding to decision rules of the POSG).\nIn the infinite-horizon case, some assumptions on the class of decision rules \u03b4ti are needed to be able to formulate the plan-time NOSG model and assuming infinite policy trees as the policies would violate certain technical requirements on which Ghosh\u2019s results depend (e.g., the action-spaces are required to be metric and compact spaces). However, a straightforward extension of our reduction for the case where the agents use finite-state controllers (analogous to such formulations for Dec-POMDPs [10]), would satisfy these requirements, and as such we can infer the existence of a value for such games:\nCorollary 1. For infinite-horizon zs-POSGs where agents are restricted to use finite-state controllers for their policies, the value of the game exists.\nIn that way, our reduction shows that some of the properties established by Ghosh et al. for a limited subset of zero-sum stochastic games, in fact extend to a much broader class of problems."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "There is rich body of literature on zero-sum games, and we provide pointers to the most relevant works here. The concave and convex structure we have found for the zs-POSG value function is similar to the saddle point structure associated with min-max equilibria [1]. Note, however, that we have defined the value function in terms of the distribution over information, rather than the substantially different space of joint strategies, solving of which requires flattening the game to normal form. That is, our results tell us something about the value of acting using the current information, thus they may give insight into games of general partial observability.\nA recent paper that is similar in spirit to ours is by Nayyar et al. [13] who introduce a so-called Common Information Based Conditional Belief \u2014 a probability distribution over AOHs and the state conditioned on common information \u2014 and use it to design a dynamic-programming approach for zs-POSGs. This method converts stages of the zs-POSG to Bayesian Games for which the type distribution corresponds to the statistic at that stage. However, since their proposed statistic is a distribution over joint AOHs and states, the statistic we propose in this paper is more compact. More importantly, Nayyar et al. do not provide any results regarding the structure of the value function, which is the main contribution of our paper.\nHansen et al. [7] present a dynamic-programming approach for finite-horizon (general sum) POSGs that iteratively constructs sets of one-step-longer (pure) policies for all agents. At every iteration, the sets of individual policies are pruned by removing dominated policies. This pruning is based on a different statistic called multi-agent belief : a distribution over states and policies of other agents. Such a multi-agent belief is sufficient from the perspective of an individual agent to determine its best response (or whether some of its policies are dominated). A more generalized investigation of individual statistics in decentralized settings is given by Wu & Lall [28]. However, these notions are not a sufficient statistic for the past joint policy from a designer perspective (as is the proposed plan-time sufficient statistic in this paper). In fact, they are complementary and we hypothesize that they can be fruitfully combined in future work.\nThere are works from game theory literature that present structural results on the value function of so-called \u2018repeated zero-sum games with incomplete information\u2019 [11, 21, 22, 23]. These can best be understood as a class of two-player extensive form games that lie in between Bayesian games and POSGs: at the start of the game, nature determines the state (a joint type) from which each agent makes a private observation (i.e., individual type), and subsequently the agents take actions in turns, thereby observing the actions of the opponent. The models for which these results have been proven are therefore substantially less general than the zs-POSG model we consider.\nFor various flavors of such games, it has been shown that the value function has a concave/convex structure: cases with incomplete information on one side [23, 26], and cases with incomplete information on both sides where \u2018observations are independent\u2019 (i.e., where the distribution over joint types is a product of individual type distributions) [21] or dependent (general joint type distributions) [11, 22]. These results, however, crucially depend on the alternating actions and the static state and therefore do not extend to zs-POSGs.\nA game-theoretic model that is closely related to the POSG model is the Interactive POMDP or I-POMDP [6]. In I-POMDPs, a (subjective) belief bi(s, \u03b6j) is constructed from the perspective of a single agent as a probability distribution over states and the types, \u03b6j , of the other agent. A level-k I-POMDP agent i reasons about level(k \u2212 1) types \u03b6j . Since each \u03b6j fully determines the future policy of the other agent j, an I-POMDP can be interpreted as a best-response POMDP similar to the one introduced by Nair et al. [12] (discussed in Section 5), with the difference that the state also represents which policy the other agent uses. The differences mentioned in Section 5 also apply here; where an I-POMDP can be used to compute a bestresponse, our formulation is aimed at computing a Nash equilibrium."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "This paper presents a structural result on the shape of the value function of two-player zero-sum games of incomplete information, for games of static state and dynamic state, typically modeled as\na Bayesian Game (BG) and Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) respectively. We formally defined the value function for both types of games in terms of an information distribution called the sufficient plan-time statistic: a probability distribution over joint sets of private information (originally used in the collaborative setting [15]). Using the fact that this probability distribution can be decomposed into a marginal and a conditional term, we presented that in the zero-sum case value functions of both types of games exhibit concavity (convexity) in the space of marginal statistics of the maximizing (minimizing) agent, for every conditional statistic. In the multi-stage game, this structure of the value function is preserved on every stage. Thus, our formulation enables us to make statements about how value generalizes as a function of the information distribution. Lastly, we showed how the results allow us to reduce our zs-POSG to a model with shared observations, thereby transferring properties of this narrower class of games to the zs-POSG.\nWe hope that this result leads to solution methods that exploit the structure of the value function at every stage, as recently such developments have been made in the field of cooperative multi-agent problems [10]. In particular, we believe that heuristic methods that identify useful (conditional) statistics to explore, or point-based methods that iteratively select statistics to evaluate [10, 27] may be adapted for the zs-POSG case.\nAcknowledgments This research is supported by the NWO Innovational Research Incentives Scheme Veni (#639.021.336) and NWO DTC-NCAP (#612.001.109) project."}, {"heading": "A Appendix", "text": "Proof of Lemma 1.

However, under general forms of state uncertainty as considered in the Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG), such decision making problems are still not very well understood. This paper makes a contribution to the theory of zero-sum POSGs by characterizing structure in their value function. In particular, we introduce a new formulation of the value function for zs-POSGs as a function of the \u2018plan-time sufficient statistics\u2019 (roughly speaking the information distribution in the POSG), which has the potential to enable generalization over such information distributions. We further delineate this generalization capability by proving a structural result on the shape of value function: it exhibits concavity and convexity with respect to appropriately chosen marginals of the statistic space. This result is a key pre-cursor for developing solution methods that may be able to exploit such structure. Finally, we show how these results allow us to reduce a zs-POSG to a \u2018centralized\u2019 model with shared observations, thereby transferring results for the latter, narrower class, to games with individual (private) observations.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
