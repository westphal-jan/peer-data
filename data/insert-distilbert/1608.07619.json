INTRODUCTION", "text": "When there are multiple measures of the each sample, the data is described in the a high dimensional space H by these measures. To make these high dimensional data points visible to human, a word embedding (or dimension reduction) technique is employed to map the data points to a lower dimensional space L. Usually L is a two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) space.

The stochastic neighbor embedding (SNE) [6] type of algorithms further emphasize the local relationship ahead of the global relationship. There are other dimension reduction techniques putting emphasis on different favored metrics over relationship. On a specific situation, one particular dimension reduction technique could be more suitable or more efficient than others.\nThe output from existing dimension reduction algorithm is a set of data points that are non-uniformly scattered around the visualization space, which has some drawbacks:\n1. Some data points may overlap with others. Overlap makes the information less perceivable.\n2. The data points are denser in some area. The heterogeneity makes human interaction with the data points more difficult."}, {"heading": "2. METHODS", "text": "In order to better utilize the visualization space, we proposed to distribute the data points evenly over the visualization space. The cloud of data points is deformed in the same space defined by the dimension reduction algorithm of choice. This deformation is denoted as S. In the meanwhile, it is desirable to preserve the point-wise relationship maintained by the dimension reduction algorithm. Our strategy in approaching this goal is prioritized as follows:\n1. Points are equally spaced after the mapping S.\n2. Point-wise topology is preserved. S attempts to keep point pj on the same side of point pi as before the mapping.\n3. Point-wise geometry is loosely followed. When pi is far from pj , S(pi) is far from S(pj).\nThe algorithm we propose is called the split-diffuse (SD) algorithm (Algorithm 1), which follows the strategies above. In our implementation, the SD algorithm first picks the xaxis as the dimension to split. As in Figure 2 (a), it splits the data points into two groups: the ones smaller than or equal to the median, and the ones larger than the median. Each group goes through this split step again over the ydimension, as in Figure 2 (b). We recursively split the points in x- and y-dimension iteratively, until there is only one point in current recursion.\nar X\niv :1\n60 8.\n07 61\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n6 A\nug 2\n01 6\nAlgorithm 1 Split-diffuse algorithm (square of power of 2)\nInput: data points {p} of length 2h \u00d7 2h, depth d = 0, allocation string c = '' split-diffuse ({p}, d, c)\nk \u2190 length of {p} if k = 1, then\nresolve S(p) from c return p\nend if a\u2190 mod(depth, 2) m\u2190 median of {p} in the dimension a return ([split-diffuse ({p : p \u2264 m|dim=a}, d+1, c+'L')],\n[split-diffuse ({p : p > m|dim=a}, d+1, c+'R')])\nWe keep track of the splitting path in string c. At the end of the recursion, the placement each single point p is resolved. The indexes of the SD-mapped points, S(p), are all integers, and forms a 2h\u00d7 2h array. This means that the mapped data points are equally spaced in a 2h \u00d7 2h square. To achieve this uniformity in the space L, the data points are essentially diffused from the denser area to the coarser area by the SD algorithm \u2014 hence the name split-diffuse.\nSome sample outputs from existing dimension reduction techniques are shown in Figure 1, as well as the corresponding SD outputs. Although we only present the results from t-SNE and MDS, the SD algorithm can be applied to outputs of other techniques such as the principal component analysis (PCA) [3], isomap [4], spectral embedding [1], and totally random trees embedding [2]."}, {"heading": "3. INTERACTING WITH THE DATA", "text": "The motivation to better utilize the visual space comes\nfrom the need to interact with massive amount of data. Consider the case that there are millions of items being shipped to a city every month. How can we easily observe the difference in the monthly shipping patterns? When vectoring each item as a data point, putting all the data points on a chart makes the chart hard to read. Instead, using clustering algorithms to group the points and showing the representatives is a better way to present the shipping pattern. Still, with the existing dimension reduction techniques (Figure 1 (a)-(d)), it is difficult to visually compare the difference and interact with the representative points for more detail.\nIn our use case, we apply the SD algorithm to help analyzing behavioral content in the cyber security domain. The goal of the system is to detect behavioral anomaly based on the access logs. Topics are generated on the content of the logs in a word vector space of 19K+ dimensions. MDS is applied to reduce the dimension. As shown in Figure 1 (b) and (f), topics are represented by the most relevant keywords, encrypted. Topics close to each other may share the\nsame representative keyword. The SD algorithm follows to generate the topic grids and visualize different metrics about the behavior of a user (Figure 3).\nWhen not directly displaying the detail keywords about a topic, the topic grids requires less space. At the same time, the human expert still can easily keep track of the topics based on their indexes over all dimensions and compare the difference between different sets of topic grids. Human interaction, which is the ultimate goal of the uniform placement of the data points, can be done more easily on the topic grids than on the raw dimension reduction output as in Figure 1 (a)-(d). For example, the mouse over event on a grid pops up the topical summary, and the click event to overlay the detailed topical activities.\nIt is also useful to monitor the behavior change over time. In such cases, we reserve a dimension in L as the time axis. For a 2D space L, a 1D version of SD algorithm is applied to maintain the point-wise topology. The cumulative activities have a shape of curtain. Meanwhile, we can pile up the 2D topic grids on the time axis over the 3D L, as shown in Figure 4. With normal or usual behavior, it is expected to see the consistent hot grids at the same locations over time."}, {"heading": "4. FUTURE WORK", "text": "In addition to the cyber security domain, the topic grids can be applied to other domains having free-form text logs to analyze the behavior described by the logs. Some possible use cases include e-commerce, credit card transaction, customer service, or others with large volume of behavioral data to be analyzed.\nIt is also possible to apply the topic grids to the structured data, on which an arbitrary clustering algorithm can generate cluster centers. The data points are then organized into these cluster centers, the same way we use the topic to represent the log entries related to it."}, {"heading": "5. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] M. Belkin and P.
