Studies have shown that providing relative comparisons, or perspectives, such as \u201cabout the cost to employ everyone in Texas over a lunch period\u201d significantly improves comprehension when measured in terms of memory retention or outlier detection (Barrio et al., 2016).\nPrevious work in the HCI community has relied on either manually generated perspectives (Barrio et al., 2016) or present a fact as is from a knowledge base (Chiacchieri, 2013). As a result, these approaches are limited to contexts in which a relevant perspective already exists.\nIn this paper, we generate perspectives by composing facts from a knowledge base. For example, we might describe $100,000 to be \u201cabout twice the median income for a year\u201d, and describe $5 million to be the \u201cabout how much the average person makes over their lifetime\u201d. Leveraging compositionality allows us to achieve broad coverage of numbers from a relatively small collection of familiar facts, e.g. median income and a person\u2019s\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n00 07\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\nS ep\n2 01\n6\nlifetime. Using compositionality in perspectives is also concordant with our understanding of how people learn to appreciate scale. Jones and Taylor (2009) find that students learning to appreciate scale do so mainly by anchoring with familiar concepts, e.g. $50,000 is slightly less than the median income in the US, and by unitization, i.e. improvising a system of units that is more relatable, e.g. using the Earth as a measure of mass when describing the mass of Jupiter to be that of 97 Earths. Here, compositionality naturally unitizes the constituent facts: in the examples above, money was unitized in terms of median income, and time was unitized in a person\u2019s lifetime. Unitization and anchoring have also been proposed by Chevalier et al. (2013) as the basis of a design methodology for constructing visual perspectives called concrete scales.\nWhen generating compositional perspectives, we must address two key challenges: constructing familiar, relevant and meaningful formulas and generating easy-to-understand descriptions or perspectives. We tackle the first challenge using an overgenerate-and-rank paradigm, selecting formulas using signals from familiarity, compositionality, numeric proximity and semantic similarity. We treat the second problem of generation as a translation problem and use a sequence-tosequence recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate perspectives from a formula.\nWe evaluate individual components of our system quantitatively on a dataset collected using crowdsourcing. Our formula construction method improves on F1 over a non-compositional baseline by about 17.8%. Our generation method improves over a simple baseline by 12.5 BLEU points."}, {"heading": "2 Problem statement", "text": "The input to the perspective generation task is a sentence s containing a numeric mention x: a span of tokens within the sentence which describes a quantity with value x.value and of unit x.unit. In Figure 1, the numeric mention x is \u201c$131 million\u201d, x.value = 1.31e8 and x.unit = $. The output is a description y that puts x in perspective.\nWe have access to a knowledge baseK with numeric tuples t = (t.value, t.unit, t.description). Table 1 has a few examples of tuples in our knowledge base. Units (e.g. $/per/yr) are fractions composed either of fundamental units (length, area, volume, mass, time) or of ordinal units (e.g. cars,\npeople, etc.). The first step of our task, described in Section 4, is to construct a formula f over numeric tuples in K that has the same value and unit as the numeric mention x. A valid formula comprises of an arbitrary multiplier f.m and a sequence of tuples f.tuples. The value of a formula, f.value, is simply the product of the multiplier and the values of the tuples, and the unit of the formula, f.unit, is the product of the units of the tuples. In Figure 1, the formula has a multiplier of 1 and is composed of tuples 1 , 2 and 3 ; it has a value of 1.3e8 and a unit of $.\nThe second step of our task, described in Section 5, is to generate a perspective y, a short noun phrase that realizes f . Typically, the utterance will be formed using variations of the descriptions of the tuples in f.tuples."}, {"heading": "3 Dataset construction", "text": "We break our data collection task into two steps, mirroring formula selection and description generation: first, we collect descriptions of formulas constructed exhaustively from our knowledge base (for generation), and then we use these descriptions to collect preferences for perspectives (for construction).\nCollecting the knowledge base. We manually constructed a knowledge base with 142 tuples and 9 fundamental units1 from the United States Bu-\n1Namely, length, area, volume, time, weight, money, people, cars and guns. These units were chosen because they\nreau of Statistics, the orders of magnitude topic on Wikipedia and other Wikipedia pages. The facts chosen are somewhat crude; for example, though \u201cthe cost of an employee\u201d is a very context dependent quantity, we take its value to be the median cost for an employer in the United States, $71,000. Presenting facts at a coarse level of granularity makes them more familiar to the general reader while still being appropriate for perspective generation: the intention is to convey the right scale, not necessarily the precise quantity.\nCollecting numeric mentions. We collected 53,946 sentences containing numeric mentions from the newswire section of LDC2011T07 using simple regular expression patterns like $([0-9]+(,[0-9]+)*(.[0-9]+)? ((hundred)|(thousand)|(million)| (billion)|(trillion))). The values and units of the numeric mentions in each sentence were normalized and converted to fundamental units (e.g. from miles to length). We then randomly selected up to 200 mentions of each of the 9 types in bins with boundaries 10\u22123, 1, 103, 106, 109, 1012 leading to 4,931 mentions that are stratified by unit and magnitude.2 Finally, we chose mentions which could be described by at least one numeric expression, resulting in the 2,041 mentions that we use in our experiments (Figure 2). We note that there is a slight bias towards mentions of money and people because these are more common in the news corpus.\nGenerating formulas. Next, we exhaustively generate valid formulas from our knowledge base. We represent the knowledge base as a graph over units with vertices and edges annotated with tuples (Figure 3). Every vertex in this graph is labeled with a unit u and contains the set of tuples with this unit: {t \u2208 K : t.unit = u}. Additionally, for every vertex in the graph with a unit of the form u1/u2, where u2 has no denominator, we add an edge from u1/u2 to u1, annotated with all tuples of type u2: in Figure 3 we add an edge from money/person to money annotated with the three person tuples in Table 1. The set of formulas with unit u is obtained by enumerating all paths in the graph which terminate at the vertex u. The multiplier of the formula is set so that the value of\nwere well represented in the corpus. 2Some types had fewer than 200 mentions for some bins.\nthe formula matches the value of the mention. For example, the formula in Figure 1 was constructed by traversing the graph from money/time/person to money: we start with a tuple in money/time/person (cost of an employee) and then multiply by a tuple with unit time (time for lunch) and then by unit person (population of Texas), thus traversing two edges to arrive at money.\nUsing the 142 tuples in our knowledge base, we generate a total of 1,124 formulas sans multiplier.\nCollecting descriptions of formulas. The main goal of collecting descriptions of formulas is to train a language generation system, though these descriptions will also be useful while collecting training data for formula selection. For every unit in our knowledge base and every value in the set {10\u22127, 10\u22126 . . . , 1010}, we generated all valid formulas. We further restricted this set to formulas with a multiplier between 1/100 and 100, based on the rationale that human cognition of scale sharply drops beyond an order of magnitude (Tretter et al.,\n2006). In total, 5000 formulas were presented to crowdworkers on Amazon Mechanical Turk, with a prompt asking them to rephrase the formula as an English expression (Figure 4).3 We obtained 5\u20137 descriptions of each formula, leading to a total of 31,244 unique descriptions.\nCollecting data on formula preference. Finally, given a numeric mention, we ask crowdworkers which perspectives from the description dataset they prefer. Note that formulas generated for a particular mention may differ in multiplier with a formula in the description dataset. We thus relax our constraints on factual accuracy while collecting this formula preference dataset: for each mention x, we choose a random perspective from the description dataset described above corresponding to a formula whose value is within a factor of 2 from the mention\u2019s value, x.value. A smaller factor led to too many mentions without a valid comparison, while a larger one led to blatant factual inaccuracies. The perspectives were partitioned into sets of four and displayed to crowdworkers along with a \u201cNone of the above\u201d option with the following prompt: \u201cWe would like you to pick up to two of these descriptions that are useful in understanding the scale of the highlighted number\u201d (Figure 5). A formula is rated to be useful by simple majority.4\nFigure 6 provides a summary of the dataset collected, visualizing how many formulas are useful, controlling for the size of the formula. The exhaustive generation procedure produces a large number of spurious formulas like \u201c20\u00d7 trash generated in the US\u00d7 a minute\u00d7 number of employees on Medicare\u201d. Nonetheless, compositional\n3Crowdworkers were paid $0.08 per description. 4Crowdworkers were paid $0.06 to vote on each set of\nperspectives.\nformulas are quite useful in the appropriate context; Table 2 presents some mentions with highly rated perspectives and formulas."}, {"heading": "4 Formula selection", "text": "We now turn to the first half of our task: given a numeric mention x and a knowledge baseK, select a formula f over K with the same value and unit as the mention. It is easy to generate a very large number of formulas for any mention. For the example, \u201cCristiano Ronaldo, the player who Madrid acquired for [. . . ] $131 million.\u201d, the small knowledge base in Table 1 can generate the 12 different formulas,5 including the following:\n1. 1 \u00d7 the cost of an employee \u00d7 the population of Texas \u00d7 the time taken for lunch.\n2. 400 \u00d7 the cost of an employee \u00d7 average household size \u00d7 a week.\n3. 1 \u00d7 the cost of an employee \u00d7 number of employees at Google \u00d7 a week.\n4. 1 \u00d7 cost of property in the Bay Area \u00d7 area of a city block.\nSome of the formulas above are clearly worse than others: the key challenge is picking a formula that will lead to a meaningful and relevant perspective.\nCriteria for ranking formulas. We posit the following principles to guide our choice in features (Table 3).\n5The full knowledge base described in Section 3 can generate 242 formulas with the unit money (sans multiplier).\nProximity: A numeric perspective should be within an order of magnitude of the mentioned value. Conception of scale quickly fails with quantities that exceed \u201chuman scales\u201d (Tretter et al., 2006): numbers that are significantly away from 1/10 and 10. We use this principle to prune formulas with multipliers not in the range [1/100, 100] (e.g. example 2 above) and introduce features for numeric proximity.\nFamiliarity: A numeric perspective should be composed of concepts familiar to the reader. The most common technique cited by those who do well at scale cognition tests is reasoning in terms of familiar objects (Tretter et al., 2006; Jones and Taylor, 2009; Chevalier et al., 2013). Intuitively, the average American reader may not know exactly how many people are in Texas, but is familiar enough with the quantity to effectively reason using Texas\u2019 population as a unit. On the other hand, it is less likely that the same reader is familiar with even the concept of Angola\u2019s population.\nOf course, because it is so personal, familiarity is difficult to capture. With additional information about the reader, e.g. their location, it is possible to personalize the chosen tuples (Kim et al., 2016). Without this information, we back off to a global preference on tuples by using indicator features for each tuple in the formula.\nCompatibility: Similarly, some tuple combinations are more natural (\u201cmedian income \u00d7 a month\u201d) while others are less so (\u201cweight of a person \u00d7 population of Texas\u201d). We model compatibility between tuples in a formula using an indicator feature.\nSimilarity: A numeric perspective should be relevant to the context. Apart from helping with scale cognition, a perspective should also place the mentioned quantity in appropriate context: for example, NASA\u2019s budget of $17 billion could be described as 0.1% of the United States\u2019 budget or the amount of money it could cost to feed Los Angeles for a year. While both perspectives are appropriate, the former is more relevant than the latter.\nWe model context relevance using word vector similarity between the tuples of the formula and the sentence containing the mention as a proxy for semantic similarity. Word vectors for a sentence or tuple description are computed by taking the mean of the word vectors for every non-stop-word token. The word vectors at the token level are computed using word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013).\nEvaluation. We train a logistic regression classifier using the features described in Table 3 using the perspective ratings collected in Section 3. Recall that the formula for each perspective in the dataset is assigned a positive (\u201cuseful\u201d) label if\nit was labeled to be useful to the majority of the workers. Table 5a presents results on classifying formulas as useful with a feature ablation.6\nFamiliarity and compatibility are the most useful features when selecting formulas, each having a significant increase in F1 over the proximity baseline. There are minor gains from combining these two features. On the other hand, semantic similarity does not affect performance relative to the baseline. We find that this is mainly due to the disproportionate number of unfamiliar formulas present in the dataset that drown out any signal. Table 4 presents two examples of the system\u2019s ranking of formulas."}, {"heading": "5 Perspective generation", "text": "Our next goal is to generate natural language descriptions, also known as perspectives, given a formula. Our approach models the task as a sequence-to-sequence translation task from formulas to natural language. We first describe a rulebased baseline and then describe a recurrent neural network (RNN) with an attention-based copying mechanism (Jia and Liang, 2016).\nBaseline. As a simple approach to generate perspectives, we just combine tuples in the formula with the neutral prepositions of and for, e.g. \u201c1/5th of the cost of an employee for the population of Texas for the time taken for lunch.\u201d\nSequence-to-sequence RNN. We use formulaperspective pairs from the dataset to create a sequence-to-sequence task: the input is composed using the formula\u2019s multiplier and descriptions of its tuples connected with the symbol \u2018*\u2019; the output is the perspective (Figure 7).\nOur system is based on the model described in Jia and Liang (2016). Given a sequence of input tokens (x = (xi)), the model computes a contextdependent vector (b = (bi)) for each token using a bidirectional RNN with LSTM units. We then generate the output sequence (yj) left to right as follows. At each output position, we have a hidden state vector (sj) which is used to produce an \u201cattention\u201d distribution (\u03b1j = (\u03b1ji)) over input tokens: \u03b1ji = Attend(sj , bi). This distribution is used to generate the output token and update the hidden state vector. To generate the token, we ei-\n6Significance results are computed by the bootstrap test as described in Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2012) using the output of classifiers trained on the entire training set.\nther sample a word from the current state or copy a word from the input using attention. Allowing our model to copy from the input is helpful for our task, since many of the entities are repeated verbatim in both input and output. We refer the reader to Jia and Liang (2016) for more details.\nEvaluation. We split the perspective description dataset into a training and test set such that no formula in the test set contains the same set of tuples as a formula in the training set.7 Table 5b compares the performance of the baseline and sequence-to-sequence RNN using BLEU.\n7Note that formulas with the same set of tuples can occur multiple times in the either the training or test set with different multipliers.\nThe sequence-to-sequence RNN performs significantly better than the baseline, producing more natural rephrasings. Table 6 shows some output generated by the system (see Table 6)."}, {"heading": "6 Human evaluation", "text": "In addition to the automatic evaluations for each component of the system, we also ran an end-toend human evaluation on an independent set of 211 mentions collected using the same methodology described in Section 3. Crowdworkers were asked to choose between perspectives generated by our full system (LR+RNN) and those generated by the baseline of picking the numerically closest tuple in the knowledge base (BASELINE). They could also indicate if either both or none of the shown perspectives appeared useful.8\nTable 7 summarizes the results of the evaluation and an error analysis conducted by the authors. Errors were characterized as either being errors in generation (e.g. Table 6) or violations of the criteria in selecting good formulas described in Section 4 (Table 7c). The other category mostly contains cases where the output generated by LR+RNN appears reasonable by the above criteria but was not chosen by a majority of workers. A few of the mentions shown did not properly describe a numeric quantity, e.g. \u201c. . . claimed responsibility for a 2009 gun massacre . . . \u201d and were labeled invalid mentions. The most common error is the selection of a formula that is not contextually relevant to the mentioned text because no such\n8Crowdworkers were paid $0.06 per to choose a perspective for each mention.

Compositionality is the key ingredient of our approach, which allows us synthesize information across multiple sources of information. At the same time, compositionality also poses problems for both formula selection and description generation.\nOn the formula selection side, we must compose facts that make sense. For semantic compatibility between the mention and description, we have relied on simple word vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013), but more sophisticated forms of semantic relations on larger units of text might yield better results (Bowman et al., 2015).\nOn the description generation side, there is a long line of work in generating natural language descriptions of structured data or logical forms Wong and Mooney (2007); Chen and Mooney (2008); Lu and Ng (2012); Angeli et al. (2010). We lean on the recent developments of neural sequence-to-sequence models (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015). Our problem bears some similarity to the semantic parsing work of Wang et al. (2015), who connect generated canonical utterances (representing logical forms) to real utterances.\nIf we return to our initial goal of helping people understand numbers, there are two important directions to explore. First, we have used a small knowledge base, which limits the coverage of perspectives we can generate. Using Freebase (Bol-\nlacker et al., 2008) or even open information extraction (Fader et al., 2011) would dramatically increase the number of facts and therefore the scope of possible perspectives.\nSecond, while we have focused mostly on basic compatibility, it would be interesting to explore more deeply how the juxtaposition of facts affects framing. Table 8 presents several examples generated by our system that frame the mentioned quantities to be larger or smaller than the authors originally thought. We think perspective generation is an exciting setting to study aspects of numeric framing (Teigen, 2015).\nReproducibility All code, data, and experiments for this paper are available on the CodaLab platform at https: //worksheets.codalab.org/worksheets/ 0x243284b4d81d4590b46030cdd3b72633/."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank Glen Chiacchieri for providing us information about the Dictionary of Numbers, Maneesh Agarwala for useful discussions and references, Robin Jia for sharing code for the sequence-to-sequence RNN, and the anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedback.

First, we collect a dataset of numeric mentions in news articles, where each mention is labeled with a set of rated perspectives. We then propose a system to generate these descriptions consisting of two steps: formula construction and description generation. In construction, we compose formulae from numeric facts in a knowledge base and rank the resulting formulas based on familiarity, numeric proximity and semantic compatibility. In generation, we convert a formula into natural language using a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network. Our system obtains a 15.2% F1 improvement over a non-compositional baseline at formula construction and a 12.5 BLEU point improvement over a baseline description generation.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
