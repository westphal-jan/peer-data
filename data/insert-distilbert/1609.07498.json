Introduction", "text": "As human interaction with computers becomes more pervasive, and its applications become more private and sensitive, the value of automatic Speaker Recognition (SR) based on vocal characteristics increases.\nThe employment of SR technology for children could be beneficial in several application areas, including, child security and protection, and education. For instance, social networking sites are most popular with teenagers and young adults, with almost half of children aged from 8 to 17 who use the internet having set up their own profile on a social networking site [1]. An SR system that identifies a child based on his or her voice, and confirms the identity of the individual with whom the child is communicating, could be a valuable safeguard for a child engaged in social networking. Other possible applications are in education. For example, an interactive educational tutor that could identify each child in a class could automatically continue a previous lesson, adapt its content to suit the child, and log the child\u2019s responses appropriately without the child needing to go through a formal login process.\nAlthough automatic recognition of children\u2019s speech has been the subject of considerable research effort, there is little published work on issues and algorithms related to automatic verification of a child\u2019s identity from his or her speech. For example, we do not know how increases in inter- and intraspeaker variability for children\u2019s speech [4] will affect SR performance. Variability is highest for young children, converging to adult values when children reach the age of 13. Even for young children there is some evidence that the degree of variability varies significantly between individuals [6].\ncharacteristics of children\u2019s speech are different from those of adult\u2019s [3-5]. For example, children\u2019s speech is characterized by higher pitch, and perceptually important features such as formants occur at higher frequencies [4]. Consequently, the impact of bandwidth reduction on speech recognition accuracy is greater for children\u2019s speech than for adults [6, 7]. However, we do not know the significance of different frequency bands for SR for children, although the relevant studies for adult SR have been reported [2].\nThe success of Gaussian Mixture Model - Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM) and GMM-Support Vector Machine (GMM-SVM) approaches to adult SR motivated us to apply these techniques to our child SR task. The distribution of acoustic feature vectors for a population of speakers, is typically captured using a UBM (a speaker-independent GMM constructed using data from a variety of speakers and background conditions) [8, 9]. Speaker dependent GMMs are then built by MAP adaptation of the UBM [10]. Alternatively, discriminative approaches such as SVMs can be used, which have been shown to obtain comparable, and in some cases better, performance than GMM based systems. The combination of GMM supervectors, comprising the stacked parameters of the GMM components, with SVMs has also been successful [11]. SR systems usually employ score normalization to cope with score variability and to simplify decision threshold tuning.\nThis paper presents the results of experiments in SR for children\u2019s speech and is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the OGI \u2018Kid\u2019s\u2019 corpus of children\u2019s speech, which is used in all experiments. Our SR systems are described in section 3, and our experiments and results are presented in section 4. Section 4.1 describes a study of the utility of the information in different frequency bands for children\u2019s SR. Results of SR experiments for narrow band limited speech show that, as in the case of adults [2], the spectrum can be usefully partitioned into 4 regions, B1 to B4, with B1, B2, B3 and B4 corresponding to frequencies below 1.13kH, 0.63kHz to 3.8kHz, 2.1kHz to 5.53kHz and 3.4kHz to 8kHz, respectively. These frequencies are between 11% and 38% higher than those for adults [2]. Speaker information is concentrated in B1, which contains the primary vocal tract resonances, and B3, which contains high-frequency speech sounds such as fricatives. The speaker information in region B2 is masked by linguistic variation. It is also noted that narrow-band SR performance is consistently poorer for young children than for older children. Section 4.2 presents the results of verification and identification experiments for different age groups of children using full bandwidth speech. The best performance is obtained using a 64 component GMM-SVM system. Finally, with educational applications in mind, we simulate the problem of recognizing a single child in a class (30 children of a similar age) or a school (288 children varying in age from 5 to 13 years). Identification accuracy for a child in a class varies from 90% for the youngest children (5- 8years) to 99% for the oldest children (12 years old and\nINTERSPEECH 2012 1836\nabove). The identification rate achieved for a child in a school is 81%.\n2. The OGI kids\u2019 speech corpus and data description\nThe OGI Kids\u2019 Speech corpus [13] is a collection of spontaneous and read speech recorded at the Northwest Regional School District near Portland, Oregon. The CSLU Toolkit is used for data collection. It comprises recordings of words and sentences from approximately 1100 children. A gender-balanced group of approximately 100 children per grade from Kindergarten (5-6 year olds) through to grade 10 (15\u201316 year olds) participated in the collection. For each utterance, the text of the prompt was displayed on a screen, and a human recording of the prompt was played, in synchrony with facial animation using the animated 3D character \u201cBaldi\u201d. The subject then repeated the prompt, which was recorded via a head-mounted microphone and digitized at 16 bits and 16 kHz.\nFour different test sets (10 seconds per utterance) from the\nOGI data are used in the experiments presented in this paper.\nTS1: To investigate the effect of different frequency bands on SR performance for general children\u2019s speech, 359 speakers were chosen randomly (kindergarten to 10th grade).\nTS2: To investigate the effect of different frequency bands on SR performance for speech from children of different ages, 3 different age groups were selected, each containing 288 speakers. These are AG1: kindergarten to 2nd grade (5-8 year olds), AG2: 3rd to 6th grade (8-12 year olds), and AG3: 7th to 10th grade (12-16 year olds).\nTS3: To investigate the problem of identifying a single child in a school, two \u2018schools\u2019 of 288 randomly chosen speakers from kindergarten to 10th grade were chosen.\nTS4: To investigate the problem of identifying a single child in a class, 12 \u2018classes\u2019 of children from 3 grade groups were chosen, each containing 30 children."}, {"heading": "3. Speaker recognition systems", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1. Signal Analysis", "text": "Feature extraction was performed as follows. Periods of silence were discarded using an energy-based Speech Activity Detector (SAD). The speech was then segmented into 20-ms frames (10-ms overlap) and a Hamming window was applied. The short-time magnitude spectrum, obtained by applying an FFT, is passed to a bank of 24 Mel-spaced triangular bandpass filters, spanning the frequency region from 0Hz to 8000Hz. Table 1 shows the center frequency of each filter (the cut-off frequencies of a filter are the centre frequencies of the adjacent filters).\nTo investigate the effect of different frequency regions on SR performance, experiments were conducted using frequency band limited speech data comprising the outputs of groups of 4 adjacent filters. We considered 21 overlapping sub-bands, where the Nth sub-band comprises the outputs of filters N to N+3 (N=1 to 21). Each set of 4 filter outputs was transformed to 4 Mel Frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and mean and variance normalization [14] was applied.\nFor the full bandwidth experiments the outputs of all 21\nfilters were transformed into 19 MFCCs."}, {"heading": "3.2. Modelling", "text": "Our SR systems are based on the GMM-UBM [9, 11] and GMM-SVM [11] methods.\nIn the GMM-UBM approach, a UBM is built using utterances from all data in the training sets of all speakers. Speaker-dependent models are obtained by MAP adaptation (adapting means only) of the UBM, using 48 second segments of speaker-specific enrollment data. The result is one UBM and 1083 speaker-dependents GMMs (a small number of speakers for whom there was very little data were not used).\nIn our GMM-SVM system, the training data from each individual speaker was divided into three segments and each was used to estimate the parameters of a GMM by MAP adaptation of the UBM. The adapted GMM mean vectors are then concatenated into a supervector [11], and the speaker classes are assumed to be linearly separable in the supervector space. The supervectors are used to build one SVM for each speaker, by treating that speaker as the \u2018target\u2019 class and the others as the \u2018background\u2019 class."}, {"heading": "In our recognition systems, the score for each speaker model is normalized using the highest score across all speakers (max-log-likelihood score normalization).", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.3. Verification and Identification experiments", "text": "Verification experiments were conducted using a version of the methodology developed for the NIST speaker recognition evaluations. Each test utterance was scored against the \u2018true\u2019 (correct) speaker model and 10 \u2018impostor\u2019 models. Results are presented in terms of percentage Equal Error Rate (EER), calculated using the standard NIST software. Identification experiments involved scoring each test utterance against a fixed test set of speaker models and assigning the model to the class with the highest score. Test sets TS1 to TS4 from Section 2 were used.\n4. Experimental results and discussion"}, {"heading": "4.1. Experiments on isolated sub-bands", "text": "In this section, we study the effect of different sub-bands on verification and identification performance for children\u2019s speech from the OGI corpus. SR tests are conducted separately on 21 sub-bands, each consisting of four consecutive channels (Section 3.1).\nFigures 1(a) and (b) show the verification and identification performances, respectively, for the 359 speaker test set (TS1) on each of the 21 sub-bands, using 64 component GMM-UBM and GMM-SVM systems (64\nINTERSPEECH 2012 1837\ncomponent GMMs were found to be adequate for these 4 dimensional sub-bands). Overall, it is clear that the GMMSVM approach outperforms GMM-UBM.\nIn the case of verification, Figure 1(a) shows sub-band EERs varying between 10% and 37%. For identification (Figure 1(b)) the sub-band identification rates vary between 5% and 34%.\nFrom Figure 1 it is evident that, as in the case of adult speech [2], it is convenient to partition the spectrum into 4 frequency regions, B1 to B4, where B1 corresponds to subbands 1-5 (0-1.13kH), B2 to sub-bands 6-14 (0.63kHz \u2013 3.8kHz), B3 to sub-bands 15-18 (2.1kHz \u2013 5.53kHz), and B4 to sub-bands 19-21 (3.4kHz to 8kHz). The most useful bands for SR are B1, which contains individual differences in the part of the spectrum due to primary vocal tract resonances and nasal speech sounds, and B3, which contains information relating to high-frequency speech sounds such as fricatives. One would expect B2 to be useful since it contains information about vocal tract resonances, however the speaker specific information in this region appears to be masked by variations due to the linguistic content of the signal. Interestingly, the GMM-SVM system is able to extract more speaker-specific information from B2 than the GMM-UBM system. The importance of fricatives (and hence region B3) for SR has been noted previously in [15]. Frequency regions similar to B1 to B4 were identified in [2] for adult SR on TIMIT. However, compared to the adult values, the frequency ranges spanned by these bands for children\u2019s speech are increased by approximately 38% (B1), 21% (B2) and 11% (B3).\nFigure 2 shows sub-band speaker identification rates for three different age-groups of children, namely AG1, AG2 and AG3 (described in section 2). The figure shows that in almost all cases the best performance is obtained for the older children, and identification rate decreases for younger children. The figure shows the same fall in performance between B1 and B2, and increase between B2 and B3, for all three age groups. However, one would expect these changes to take place at higher frequencies for younger children, since in general younger children have shorter vocal tracts. Close inspection of figure 2 indicates that this is the case.\nThe result for the oldest children (7th to 10th grade, AG3) is consistent with published result for adult speaker identification on TIMIT [2]."}, {"heading": "4.2. Full-bandwidth SR for children\u2019s speech", "text": "Table 2 shows the results of SR experiments on fullbandwidth speech for the three age groups of children (AG1 to AG3, 288 children per group), using 1024 component GMM-UBM and GMM-SVM systems and a 64 component GMM-SVM system. The choice of 1024 components for the GMM-UBM system was made empirically on a separate evaluation set. Both identification rate and EER improve as the ages of the children increase. For example the EER falls by 70% from 2.1% for the youngest to 0.64% for the oldest children. The corresponding increase in identification rate is 38%. The performance of the 1024 component GMM-SVM system was unexpectedly poor. An experiment on a separate evaluation set showed that the best number of GMM components for this system is 64, due to the short test utterances. The performance of the 64 component GMM-SVM system is shown in column 4 of Table 2. Verification performance is similar to that obtained for the 1024 component GMM-UBM system, but the identification rates are between 9% and 20% better for the 64 component GMM-SVM system.\nINTERSPEECH 2012 1838\nThe purpose of our final experiment is to evaluate SR performance for children\u2019s speech on tasks which are representative of potential applications. Table 3 shows the results of using the 64 component GMM-SVM system to recognize an individual child in a class (30 children from the same grade group as the target child) or school (288 children uniformly distributed across grades). The \u2018class\u2019 experiment is conducted for simulated classes from age groups AG1, AG2 and AG3. For each age group, the experiment was repeated for 4 random simulated classes, and the average result is given in Table 2.\nThe results show that a child in a class is identified with accuracies of approximately 90%, 96% and 99% for classes of 30 children in age groups AG1, AG2 and AG3, respectively. As with speech recognition, speaker recognition appears to be significantly more difficult for younger children.\nThe identification rate for an individual child in a\nschool of 288 children is 81%.\nThis paper presents the results of experiments in SR for children\u2019s speech. A study of the utility of different narrow frequency bands for child SR has shown that, as with adults, the spectrum can be usefully partitioned into 4 regions, referred to as B1 to B4, such that most useful speaker information is concentrated in B1, which contains the primary vocal tract resonances, and B3, which contains high-frequency speech sounds such as fricatives. However, the frequencies at which these regions occur are between 11% and 38% higher for young children than for adults. It has also been shown that sub-band SR identification rates are consistently poorer for younger children than for older children.\nExperiments which simulate recognition of an individual child in a class or a school, using a 64 component GMM-SVM system, show that identification rates for a child in a class vary between 90% for the youngest to 99% for the oldest children, and that the identification rate for a child in a school is 81%.\n6.

Regions of the spectrum containing important speaker information for children are identified by conducting SR experiments over 21 frequency bands. As for adults, the spectrum can be split into four regions, with the first (containing primary vocal tract resonance information) and third (corresponding to highfrequency speech sounds) being most useful for SR. However, the frequencies at which these regions occur are from 11% to 38% higher for children. It is also noted that subband SR rates are lower for younger children. Finally results are presented of SR experiments to identify a child in a class (30 children, similar age) and school (288 children, varying ages). Class performance depends on age, with accuracy varying from 90% for young children to 99% for older children. The identification rate achieved for a child in a school is 81%.", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
