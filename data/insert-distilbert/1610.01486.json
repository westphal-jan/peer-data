This interest has increased significantly in the last decades due to the expansion of computing power, the availability of structured digitalized linguistic data, and the adoption of methods first developed for biological research, such, as remembered by List (2012), phylogenetic analysis (e.g., Ringe, Warnow, and Taylor (2002); Gray and Atkinson (2003); Holman et al. (2011)) and statistical aspects of genetic relationship (e.g., Baxter and Ramer (n.d.); Mortarino (2009)). The new methods have drawn substantial criticism from more traditionally oriented researchers, as exemplified by the review of Gray and Atkinson (2003) by both Ha\u0308kkinen (2012) and Pereltsvaig and Lewis (2015). Among the most common objections, which tend to extend the criticisms to Joseph Greenberg\u2019s \u201cmass comparison\u201d (such as in Campbell (2001)), is a general opposition to analyses that rely exclusively in lexical data, where the difficulty in controlling for false cognates and borrowed lexemes is contrasted by the regularity of standard reconstructions focused in morphological and phonological elements.\nWhen considering these criticisms, the obvious alternative is to replace or extend cognate sets of lexical data from the comparison of the surface level of candidates for cognancy in terms of phonetic similarity. However, phonetic similarity is a very broad term without an accepted or even possible definition, often, as stated by Mielke (2012), \u201cinvoked for explaining a wide range of phonological\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n01 48\n6v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\nN ov\nD RA FT\nobservations\u201d: while the notion of \u201cphoneme\u201d as a distinctive unit of sound in a language is not disputed, the differentiation of actual phonemes across languages, particularly in the case of historical analysis with inferred data, is contextual and depends on the level of detail agreed upon when describing segments of sound. In short, a single and universal model for phoneme similarity is impossible. To face this limitation, most models of phonetic similarity don\u2019t offer a formal description of their scoring functions, but are guidelines used by researchers and their tools when deciding the most likely candidates for a sound change or correspondence, usually based in similarities of place and manner of articulation and in the frequency of sounds, sound changes, and sound correspondences. While quantitative models for well-studied families such as Indo-European can be derived from observable data, in other cases, particularly when the relationship itself is the object of investigation, the models are forcibly based in data extrapolated from known families and intuition.\nAs in the case of Mielke (2012), this work offers a model for \u201cquantifying phonetic similarity, [. . . ] and for distinguishing phonetic similarity from phonological notions of similarity, such as those based on features [. . . ] or on phonological patterning\u201d. It intends to offer dimensionless distances between phonological segments described with a broad set of distinctive features; in particular, there are no separate submodels based in phonological classes, allowing researchers to compare between any two segments (including between vowels and consonants). Despite its many limitations, some of which are described in the last section, by ultimately relying in acoustic and articulatory properties, only complemented by perceptual ones when necessary, this model can be used as a reference for future models or as a source of prior probabilities for Bayesian analyses, particularly in cases for which no model of phonetic or phonological similarity can be computed from observable data or agreed upon by experts."}, {"heading": "1.1 Review of alternative models", "text": "As in the review by List (2012) of automatic approaches for cognancy detection in multilingual word lists, whose description of the process is here condensed, most methods analyze the surface similarity of phonetic sequences, such as words and morphemes, by calculating a \u201cphonetic distance\u201d. This analysis usually builds upon the paradigm of sequence alignment, where the phonemes of the sequences are arranged in a matrix in such a way that corresponding phonemes occupy the same column, with empty cells filled with gap symbols resulting from non-corresponding segments (Gusfield (1997), 216). Each matched residue pair is given a specific phoneme similarity score based on the scoring function at the core of the analysis. The calculation of a normalized distance score from the individual distances allows to determine cognancy, which is assumed in the case of a sequence score under a certain threshold.\nScoring functions are essentially of two types: those that consider the edit distance, which only distinguish identical from non-identical segments (thus returning the same score for a different but related pair such as /p/ and /b/, and for a different and more dissimilar pair such as /p/ and /a/), and those which return individual scores based in the similarity of the phonemes being compared, such as the ALINE algorithm of Kondrak (2002) and the sound-class models after the work of Dolgopolsky (1964); the first type is marginally useful and reserved for the comparison of very similar sequences, while the second is\nD RA FT\nrecommended for complex, multi-language studies. According to List (2012), the advantage of these methods is that the similarity of phonetic segments is not determined on the basis of phonetic features, but on the probability that their segments occur in a correspondence relation in genetically related languages, as resulting by the comparison of sequences with respect to their sound classes. In his original study based on an empirical analysis of sound correspondence frequencies in a sample of over 400 languages, Dolgopolsky (1964) proposed ten fundamental sound classes, with the idea of \u201c[dividing] sounds into such groups, that changes within the boundary of the groups [would be] more probable than transitions from one group into another\u201d (List\u2019s translation from the Russian original of Burlak and Starostin, 2005, 272), determining cognancy by comparing the classes of the first two consonants of word roots.\nThere are known limitations to the model of Dolgopolsky, such as sometimes failing to match attested cognates in the common case of sound changes that operate at a suprasegmental level. An example given by List (2012) is the correspondence between the German word Tochter [tOxt@r] and the English word daughter [dO:t@r], a false negative in the model of Dolgopolsky that does not consider the lengthening of the English vowel that precedes the cancelled consonant as a correspondence to the German fricative. Alternatives include SCA, an extension of Dolgopolsky\u2019s model by List (2012), and the Automated Similarity Judgment Program (ASJP), an independent sound-class model developed in the context of language classification by Holman et al. (2011); these three models are used in LiNGPY (List and Forkel (2016)). Bibliographic review has identified some additional proposals, usually with ad hoc individual scores established by researchers based on personal experience and intuition; however, no actual numeric data for these proposals is available to the general public.\nAn alternative to these phonological models, which as stated operate on classes of observed historic sound changes and whose principle of naturalness and applicability of sound changes to all languages is debatable, are models of phonetic distance. Exemples are models that try to quantify phoneme descriptions in terms of place and manner of articulation, such as in calculations of the Euclidean distance between vowels in the vowel trapezium, and those based in acoustic measurements, such as the one developed by Mielke (2012) and here extended. However, as far as bibliographic research has shown, this last model has never been used for cognancy detection, an omission that likely results, at least in part, from its reliance in distinctive features, the theoretic fundamental units of phonological structure described as traits that distinguish among natural classes of segments.\nIt is important to note that Mielke (2008) refutes the idea that distinctive features have a biological basis, a property that is usually assumed given their extended usage in generative theory and particularly in Chomsky and Halle (1991), and adopts the different and explicitly \u201cnon-natural\u201d theory of feature emergence. In fact, while supposedly \u201cnatural\u201d, the actual distinctive features have even less consensus than standard descriptions in terms of place and manner of articulation: the development of the theory can be traced back to Nikolai Trubetzkoy\u2019s proposal of privative phonological oppositions, but the more serious developments have been conducted by Roman Jakobson, which served as a starting point for the more established models of Chomsky & Halle, Halle & Clements and Ladefoged. Mielke (2008) states that the motivation for his metric was the investigation of the role of phonetic similarity in determining\nD RA FT\nthe sets of segments involved in sound patterns, extending his earlier argument, in explicit contrast to Chomsky & Halle, that \u201can all-purpose model is in conflict with many of the attested phonologically active classes, including recurrent ones, and that the preference for certain classes (e.g., vowels, nasals) is driven by physiological and perceptual factors and their role in diachronic change\u201d.\nAs described by the author, his model is a metric for measuring phonetic similarity based on several types of cross-linguistic phonetic data, in particular inventory frequency. Data also came from the acoustic production of segments by trained phoneticians and native speakers, with both audio and video recording, from which numeric features of production were extracted, yielding measurements such as oral airflow, nasal airflow, vocal fold contact area, larynx height, acoustic principal components, and vocal tract principal components. These values were combined with measures of phonological similarity formulated using the sound patterns reported in a database and software called P-base, which contained 6,077 phonologically active classes that serve as the trigger or target for an alternation, many of which are involved in multiple sound patterns within the same language. Discussing the results, Mielke states that some familiar patterns \u201care seen in the phonetic and phonological similarity [. . . ], involving the patterning of non-sibilant voiced fricatives, glottals, and the association of particular contrast with particular types of data\u201d; apparently strange behavior, such as the patterning of trills and flaps, is attributed by the author to non disclosed \u201cmethodological issues\u201d. Despite its limitation, particularly the number of covered phonemes, this model was elected as the basis for the one here proposed."}, {"heading": "1.2 The new and tentative model", "text": "The model here presented is part of a larger project for applying quantitative methods to historical linguistics; among its goals are the estimation of probability for ancestral states represented as phonemes.

This section offers a broad description of the obstacles found and solutions adopted.\nGiven the requirements for the model listed above, after investigating which feature systems could be used as a basis for the one here presented the decision rested on the feature set of Phoible by Moran, McCloy, and Wright (2014), a repository of cross-linguistic phonological inventory data extracted from source documents and tertiary databases. For every segment in its database, Phoible includes a distinctive feature description based on Hayes (2009) with additions from S. R. Moisik and Esling (2011), and intended for adequate cross-linguistic description. It should be stressed that the feature set in Phoible is descriptive and not exclusive as in other models, such as in Chomsky & Halle: for example, it includes both labial and labiodental features, which in most other systems are explained by combining different features or by reducing them to a single feature. Future models will probably use a different set of features, particularly the one from Department of Linguistics \u2013 UCSB (2016).\nThe review of the bibliography by Mielke (2008) on distinctive features suggested incorporating and extending his work on phoneme similarity based on acoustic properties, as described in the previous section, by combining the distinctive features used in Phoible with the phoneme comparison scores offered by Mielke (2012). Unfortunately, neither the P-Data phonotactic resources nor the phoneme distance matrix were available at the address listed in Mielke (2008); an old version of P-Data was obtained from an archived page hosted at University of Ottawa, not available at the time of writing, and a partial list of phonetic similarity scores was obtained from Savva et al. (2014). This matrix of phonetic similarity includes only a limited number of phonemes (51), with around 1,300 scores; among its limitations, it does not include a single entry for many distinctive features used in Phoible, such as advancedTongueRoot and long, and does not include non-pulmonic consonants. The data from this reduced Mielke\u2019s matrix was extended with phoneme and allophone distribution data across language inventories, combining resources from Phoible, from Fonetikode by Dediu and Moisik (2015), and from Creanza et al. (2015), with minimal normalization accounting for language relatedness. The results from the first regression models were far from optimal, as the combination of language variables (such as co-occurrence across inventories and allophone distribution) and distinctive features properties resulted in datasets that exceeded the limits for numeric generalization.\nThe set of distinctive features for all phonemes in the available Mielke matrix was then combined with the scores from the same matrix; all features from Phoible were included, with the exception of stress and tone. The first was not included given our goals (suprasegmental qualities should be indicated at sequence, and not at phoneme level) and the second was excluded for being used in Phoible to distinguish tone marks from phonemes, and not to indicate the tonality of vowels. The dataset dimension was reduced by converting the categorical features of Phoible to logical features; null values, which represent \u201cnon applicable\u201d, were considered logical negatives. Scores were normalized in the range 0.0 to 1.0 and some manual corrections were performed in face\nD RA FT\nof inconsistencies in the IPA representation between the Phoible database and Mielke\u2019s matrix (for example, converting the stop in palato-alveolar affricates in Phoible, explicitly marked as dentals, to alveolars).\nAs expected, the intercepts for the first linear models were around 1.0, with mostly negative coefficients. Data exploration confirmed that acoustic features in general had larger coefficients, so that manner of articulation had higher scores than place of articulation. For example, the single largest negative coefficient was the one for when both phonemes are non strident, indicating a proximity for -strident phonemes, while some features for place of articulation have positive coefficients (such as +back, +coronal and +labiodental), suggesting that the difference between phonemes that share these traits are even more dependent on manner of articulation. Even though neural networks are said to resemble black boxes, models of different topologies were developed and studied to understand the relationships, that were clearer given that the limited amount of data inevitably resulted in over-fitting; the neuron connections indicated that, while there is interaction between features, it was not significant enough to justify a multidimensional and non-linear model for our purposes.\nData exploration confirmed that, despite the strong multicollinearity problems as expected from the strong feature correlation and the reduced number of phoneme comparisons available in Mielke\u2019s matrix, it was acceptable to base the model after linear regressions with parameters estimated by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). The first models performed fairly enough in most comparisons of phonemes not included but similar to those available in the matrix, a decision that was considered consistent with phonetic theory. Among the main differences with the scores of Mielke\u2019s model, this first model rated the mean distance between stops and fricatives lower and with less standard deviation than Mielke\u2019s model, whose model also tends to assign a larger weight to vowel openness than vowel backness (mean distances of 0.35 and 0.19, respectively), essentially equivalent in the model here proposed. At the same time, this model returns higher mean distances than Mielke when comparing stops and affricates, particularly in the case of different places of articulation, and tends to return higher values than Mielke when comparing vowels to voiced consonants. In general, these differences are probably due to a dependence of Mielke\u2019s model in acoustic values which seems to be computed on a case by case basis, while our model is linear consistent."}, {"heading": "1.2.2 Solving problems with Mielke\u2019s data", "text": "As mentioned above, Mielke\u2019s matrix covers a small subset of the segments listed in Phoible, and in particular there are nine distinctive features not covered by any segment: advanced tongue root, click, epilaryngeal source, fortis, long, lowered larynx, raised larynx, retracted tongue root, short. As the intended model is not a measure of acoustic and inventory data but a dimensionless scale constructed from these data, acting as a proxy for quantifying the differences perceived by expert phoneticians, the matrix needed to be extended with inferences, including data points that would allow the regression algorithms to generalize across the entire segment inventory. The essential points for this inferences are described in this section and the complete list of included data points can be found in the source code.\nD RA FT\nAdvanced and retracted tongue root Phoible includes four advanced tongue root segments and 115 retracted tongue root segments (mostly pharyngealized vowels and consonants). ATR and RTR, as commonly abbreviated, are contrasting states of the root of the tongue in the production of sounds (in most cases, vowels), particularly common in languages of West and East Africa. Phonetically, ATR and RTR involve an expansion or a contraction, respectively, of the pharyngeal cavity. In the case of ATR, the larynx is lowered during the pronunciation, adding a breathy quality; in the case of RTR, the retraction generally has an effect of partial pharyngealization. Considering that almost every language that presents these features also exhibit some kind of vowel harmonization system that could be simulated from available data points, information from the Fante dialect of the Akan language from Stewart (1967) was combined with a provisional system for Brazilian Portuguese from Lee (2013) to establish an \u201cadvanced tongue root delta\u201d from the distance of proximal vowels in terms of mouth opening and backness, which seems reasonable considering other deltas based exclusively in place of articulation.\nWhile it would have been valid to replicate the calculation for tongue root retraction, for example calculating the distance between voiced uvular and epiglottal stops, /\u00e5/ and /\u00dc/, or between corresponding fricatives, /K/ and /Q/, Mielke\u2019s matrix unfortunately offers no pharyngeal or epiglottal phoneme. The value for advanced tongue root delta was thus replicated to retracted tongue root delta.\nNon-pulmonic consonants For modeling non-pulmonic consonants, clicks, ejectives, and implosives (features click, raisedLarynxEjective, and loweredLarynxImplosive in Phoible) were considered similar sounds related to stop consonants and differing exclusively in manner of articulation. It was assumed that clicks can technically be described as obstruents articulated with two points of mouth closure, in which the enclosed pocket of air is rarefied by a sucking action of the tongue; in acoustic terms, this assumes that, all other airflow variables being equal, clicks are the loudest possible speech sounds. Considering that one class is frequently mistaken for the other, and that processes of allophony and sound change commonly involve both classes, the modeling also considered that ejectives are the consonants closer to clicks. Regarding implosives, it was assumed that, among non-pulmonic consonants, they are the ones acoustically closer to standard stops, as the implosion is caused by simply pulling the glottis downwards, expanding the vocal tract.\nGiven these considerations, a central non-pulmonic delta was stipulated as numerically equivalent to the largest possible difference in manner of articulation, computed after a mean difference between stops and corresponding affricates, for a value of circa 0.28 (some stop/affricate pairs were excluded because the model performance was clearly inadequate). A second delta of circa 0.24, stipulated as equivalent to the mean value between corresponding stops and fricatives, and a third delta, stipulated as half the mean distance between corresponding stops and ejectives, were calculated to add data points relative to non-pulmonic consonants to our dataset.\nFortis Feature fortis, sometimes confused or combined with the feature voice, is commonly used to distinguish between a standard and a more \u201cpro-\nD RA FT\nnounced\u201d articulation of the same sound, usually a consonant; it tends to be used in contrast with lenis, a feature missing in Phoible mostly used to denote an underlying change in pronunciation that can have many different surface forms, such as in voicing/devoicing, aspiration/deaspiration, glottalization, velarization, phoneme lengthening, lengthening of nearby vowels, etc. In Phoible, however, the feature fortis seems to be used exclusively to indicate phonemes for languages where the contrast between stops do not involve voicing. Considering that the feature is probably superfluous for the goals of this model, as well as its low number of occurrences, it was stipulated that fortis would be the mean value between the voiced and the voiceless version of a phoneme.\nLong and short As in the case of fortis and lenis, long is usually considered an underlying, deep feature that has different surface realizations, the most common being vowel lengthening for vowels and gemination for consonants. Considering that this kind of description frequently considers the difference between flaps and trills as an expression of an underlying long feature, the mean value of distance between corresponding flaps and trills in Mielke\u2019s matrix was stipulated as equivalent to a \u201clong delta\u201d."}, {"heading": "1.2.3 Normalization and intuition", "text": "After the stipulation of the deltas described in the subsections above, the models were run a successive number of times, manually adjusting missing data points according to phonetic theory, to the author\u2019s intuition and to discussions with colleagues.

The first part of the aphorism is certainly applicable to the model here presented: apart from the inescapable shortcomings of a universal model based on the abstract concept of \u201cphoneme\u201d, the final matrix has a number of limitations, such as the omission of tones and suprasegmental features and an inconsistent treatment of phoneme grouping (for example, affricates are treated as a single unit, while diphthongs are not). An even more consistent objection is that it consists of a one-rate model offered for applications where two-rated models would be expected and needed. This, in fact, is an essential limitation of the matrix here presented, as it proposes a solution based in acoustic and perceptual differences for the quantification of the transitional differences of historical linguistics, in which it is well established that sound changes in a given direction are more natural and expected than the inverse ones. For example, in many different languages (Ancient Greek, Proto-Iranian, Caribbean Spanish, etc.), the evolution from /s/ to /h/, from an alveolar to a glottal fricative, is expected as a consequence of the anticipatory widening of the glottis that allows an adequate airflow for the voiceless fricative, while the sound change in the opposite direction is not attested; at the same time, the palatalisation of velars before front vowels is well established, \u201cwhereas the backing and hardening of postalveolar or alveolar fricatives before non-front vowels is virtually unheard of\u201d (both examples are from Weiss (2015)).\nThe author believes, however, that the model can be useful for some applications of language evolution modeling (including the generation of random datasets for stressing algorithms). In particular, considering attested sound changes and the Bayesian approach to this kind of method that dominates the field, the scores should provide a useful prior probability for hypothesis testing, possibly more helpful than attributing the same probability to every transition or diving phonemes in classes based in their vowelness, voiceness, or place of articulation, as these categories, useful for synchronic description, have limited usefulness in diachronic research; the distances provided by these model should accelarate the estimation of parameters from actual, historical data on language\nD RA FT\nevolution. At last, the author believes that the model can be used as a scoring function for local and global pairwise alignment of phoneme sequences, both in global alignment analyses based on the algorithm by Needleman and Wunsch (1970) and in alignment analyses which maximize local similarities as in Morgenstern, Dress, and Werner (1996).\nFuture work should extend this model with language specific data, particularly for the research of the development of Indo-European phonetic inventories.
