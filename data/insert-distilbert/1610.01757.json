The majority type of stroke is ischemic. The standard tool for diagnosing stroke is CT-Scan. For developing countries like Indonesia, the availability of CT-Scan is very limited and still relatively expensive. Because of the availability, another device that potential to diagnose stroke in Indonesia is EEG. Ischemic stroke occurs because of obstruction that can make the cerebral blood flow (CBF) on a person with stroke has become lower than CBF on a normal person (control) so that the EEG signal have a deceleration. On this study, we perform the ability of 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1DCNN) to construct classification model that can distinguish the EEG and EOG stroke data from EEG and EOG control data. To accelerate training process our model we use Batch Normalization. Involving 62 person data object and from leave one out the scenario with five times repetition of measurement we obtain the average of accuracy 0.86 (F-Score 0.861) only at 200 epoch. This result is better than all over shallow and popular classifiers as the comparator (the best result of accuracy 0.69 and F-Score 0.72 ).

For a specific ischemic stroke occurs when a blockage (obstruction) of the small blood vessels around the brain (Fig. 1). Furthermore, ischemic is the majority of stroke events. Ischemic stroke is 87% of all stroke cases in the United States in 2015, as reported by American Stroke Association 2015 [13]. Based on the results of research published by the Agency for Health Research and Development (Balitbangkes) in January 2015, stroke was the number one of disease that leading cause of death in Indonesia [14]. The prevalence of stroke in Indonesia keeps on the increase. On Research Publication of Basic Health (Riskesda) 2013 the prevalence had reached 12.1%. The province in Indonesia with the\n1/13\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n01 75\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 6\nhighest prevalence of stroke and its symptoms in the year 2013 was South Sulawesi (17.9%) [1]. In general, large urban areas recorded a higher prevalence of stroke than the rural area. Some people believe that the higher prevalence happened because of the pressure of life in big cities are greater than the pressure of life in the countryside. However, as the concern is in the big city which has medical support equipment that widely available so that the incidence of stroke is recorded better than the data collection in rural areas that have inadequate health facilities.\nThe tool that can be used to diagnose stroke accurately is a Computerized Tomography Scanner (CT-Scan). Although stated at safe levels, the use of CT-Scan procedure still quite risky, because the patient is exposed by X-rays. Especially for developing countries like Indonesia the availability of CT-Scan is still very limited, only available in large hospitals. Besides of that, the cost of CT-Scan use is still relatively expensive. Another potential tool to be used as an alternative or support the CT-Scan is Electroencephalography (EEG). Not only in addition to minimizing the risk but also the availability of EEG in Indonesia is more than the availability of CT scan. EEG have been already available in a hospital with grade C. The hospital with grade C is a hospital with limited health care subspecialists which is available in each district in Indonesia.\nBased on the conditions described above, it can be identified an issue related to the handling of stroke in rural areas in Indonesia with inadequate health facilities. Because of in Indonesia, the presence of EEG relatively more available than CT scan so an alternative solution that can be taken is via addition the usefulness of EEG for detecting ischemic stroke. Unfortunately, until now there are no accurate algorithms as the standard that can be used to detect and identify the ischemic stroke events through the EEG signals. When a robust algorithm for detecting the ischemic stroke based on EEG signal can be formulated, then it makes the EEG be a better choice to use than a CT scan in Indonesia. Referring to the problems in this article we present new techniques for recognizing the ischemic stroke from the EEG signal using deep learning approach."}, {"heading": "1 Previous Research", "text": "The diagnosis of ischemic stroke by EEG rhythms often associated with the function of blood circulation around the brain as a carrier of oxygen to the brain. Blood circulation in the brains of normal people has a level of Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF): 50-70 mL.100 g-1.min-1. For ischemic stroke patients, they have indications that the CBF value only in the range of between 25-30 g-1.min mL.100-1 [8]. Through the observation, the condition of impairment CBF is accompanied by changes in the pattern of EEG signals. The declining value of the CBF will be accompanied by the decelerating of the EEG signals. EEG signal patterns undergo changes ranging from the loss of fast beta waves\n2/13\n(fast frequency like beta and gamma), followed by changes theta rhythm become dominant, until getting slow down and become to be delta waves.\nFrom some previous studies revealed that it is possible to diagnose ischemic stroke use EEG. Murri et al. in [11] have proven that Quantitative EEG (qEEG) has expanded the functionality of a conventional EEG. qEEG is the result of numerical analysis of the EEG signal spectrum. In that study also analyzes the correlation between interpretation value of qEEG compare to CT scan diagnose for patients with ischemic stroke. As a conclusion qEEG afford: (i) to support the localization of parts of nerve on clinical examination, ii) qEEG provide prognostic index of functional disorders of the brain and iii) qEEG can construct a \u2019basic electrophysiology\u2019 to determine further action on the patient with ischemic. However, the analysis process using qEEG rated requires time and need some stages, so it is relatively difficult to implement. Jordan in [8] also suggests the potentiality use of EEG combined with cutting-edge signal processing techniques for early detection of Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) in the future. His statement was supported by the evidence that the analysis of the EEG signal can add to the value of early diagnosis, prediction results, the selection of medication treatment for patients, clinical management, and detection of seizures in AIS. Foreman and Claassen [4] found preliminary evidence that quantitative EEG (qEEG) is quite sensitive for the detection of ischemic stroke to avoid permanent nerve damage. Referring to it, on this article, we perform the ability of EEG combine with deep learning techniques to recognize the signal structure of an ischemic stroke in EEG signal. From this study we hope that the use of EEG can be expanded and in some circumstances can be used for ischemic stroke diagnose.\nBSI(t) = 1\nM M\u2211 j=1 \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 N\u2211 i\u22121 Rij(t)\u2212 Lij(t) Rij(t)\u2212 Lij(t) \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 (1) Another study that was conducted by Putten et al. [12] have proposed a measure quantification of EEG signal as Brain Symmetry Index (BSI). BSI value describes the size of the symmetry of condition parts of the left brain and the right brain, given by (1). The symmetry of the value represented as the average value of the absolute value of the average difference between the intensity of hemispheric power at frequencies with a range of 1-25Hz. As an estimator to calculate the value of the power of hemispheric, it can use Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In the research done by Putten et al., they determined the threshold value of BSI for healthy people is below 0.042\u00b10.005. A significant result of their study is they can quantitatively conclude that the value of BSI positively correlated to the value of NIHSS. The correlation coefficient between BSI and NIHSS is high enough which is \u03c1 \u2248 0.86 (P<0.01). Conclusively the relationship between BSI and NIHSS can be formulated as BSI = 0.0077 NIHSS + 0.044. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a standard measurement (a scoring system) that is commonly used by health care providers when measuring the impact of the functional impairment of the body as an impact of a stroke [6]. In 2015 [15] another study was conducted by Sastra et al. using Welch analysis for detecting the decrement of frequency and BSI (brain symmetry index) for the left and right hemisphere of the brain and compared with the CT-scan to get the abnormalities of the signals. There were some irregularities of the EEG signals in comparisons with CT-scan. All patients were examined stroke based on CT-scan. However, there were examined as normal, epileptic form, and stroke based on raw EEG readings by the neurologist. All of the BSI calculations were above the healthy subjects (0.042\u00b10.005), which indicated that all subject were Acute Ischemic Stroke. While for some readings according to the conventional EEG indicated that 20% of the subjects were normal or within normal conditions. These were consistent with the ratios of power densities that all subjects\n3/13\nwere abnormal. These results were consistence with the CT Scans, but they should be extended to more subjects to get better conclusions."}, {"heading": "2 Data, Features, Classifiers, and Batch", "text": "Normalization\nThis section describes the data, features, and several classifiers to be compared in our studies."}, {"heading": "2.1 Data", "text": "We provide and use primary EEG data that were recorded by our collaboration with Pusat Otak Nasional (PON) or National Brain Center Hospital, Jakarta.

Obstruction makes the CBF level of stroke patients much lower than CBF level of a normal person. Low CBF levels have an impact on slowing the EEG signal of stroke patients. Based on these facts, the focus of the analysis of the EEG signals should be on the slow wave signals. Several other studies on the analysis of frequency bands involves four major waves with band frequencies below than 30Hz (1\u22124Hz delta, 4\u22128Hz theta, 8\u221212Hz alpha, and 12\u221230Hz beta).

Table I shows the performance parameters results for each epoch and all of the comparator classifier. Increasing epoch value accompanied by improvement the performance parameter values of 1DCNN. From the experiment with epoch 100 and epoch 200, we get the average of accuracy are 0.829 and 0.861 respectively. These results get an improvement of accuracy compare to the best achievement of the comparator (only 0.69, Naive Bayes). Descending order by the performance based on the average accuracy are 1DCNN, Naive Bayes, Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Classification Tree, Random Forest, and kNN (Fig. 6).\nFrom the experiment simple classifier Naive Bayes success to be the best performance for shallow architecture model. The F-Score of Naive Bayes is only 0.725 on the other hand F-score of 1DCNN is 0.861. From overall evaluation parameters, 1DCNN (both of 100 epoch and 200 epoch) always obtain a better result than all of the compared classifiers. The best value of parameters is achieved by 1DCNN when the\n9/13\nmaximum epoch is 200. The best value for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-score, precision, and recall has level higher than 0.86.\nIf we analyze further, for each time measurement (Fig. 7 and Table 2) the accuracy level for Naive Bayes is always 0.694. As we all know, construction of Naive Bayes model does not have stochastic aspect, unlike neural architecture models like Neural Network and 1DCNN.

On the other hand, the level of prediction success for stroke category are only 0.563 for Naive Bayes, and 0.594 for Neural Network and 0.844 for 1DCNN.

The majority type of stroke is ischemic. The standard tool for diagnosing stroke is CT-Scan. For developing countries like Indonesia, the availability of CT-Scan is very limited and still relatively expensive. Because of the availability, another device that potential to diagnose stroke in Indonesia is EEG. Ischemic stroke occurs because of obstruction that can make the cerebral blood flow (CBF) on a person with stroke has become lower than CBF on a normal person (control) so that the EEG signal have a deceleration. On this study, we perform the ability of 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1DCNN) to construct classification model that can distinguish the EEG and EOG stroke data from EEG and EOG control data. To accelerate training process our model we use Batch Normalization. Involving 62 person data object and from leave one out the scenario with five times repetition of measurement we obtain the average of accuracy 0.86 (F-Score 0.861) only at 200 epoch. This result is better than all over shallow and popular classifiers as the comparator (the best result of accuracy 0.69 and F-Score 0.72 ).
