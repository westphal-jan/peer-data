However, NN trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or its variants is known to suffer from overfitting especially when training data is insufficient. Besides overfitting, another problem of NN comes from the underestimated uncertainty, which could lead to poor performance in applications like active learning.\nBayesian neural networks (BNN) offer the promise of tackling these problems in a principled way. Early BNN works include methods based on Laplace approximation [16], variational inference (VI) [11], and Monte Carlo sampling [18], but they have not been widely adopted due to their lack of scalability. Some recent advances in this direction seem to shed light on the practical adoption of BNN. [8] proposed a method based on VI in which a Monte Carlo estimate of a lower bound on the marginal likelihood is used to infer the weights. Recently, [10] used an online version of expectation propagation (EP), called \u2018probabilistic back propagation\u2019 (PBP), for the Bayesian learning of NN, and [4] proposed \u2018Bayes by Backprop\u2019 (BBB), which can be viewed as an extension of [8] based on the \u2018reparameterization trick\u2019 [13]. More recently, an interesting Bayesian treatment called \u2018Bayesian dark knowledge\u2019 (BDK) was designed to approximate a teacher network with a simpler student network based on stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) [1].\nAlthough these recent methods are more practical than earlier ones, several outstanding problems remain to be addressed: (1) most of these methods require sampling either at training time [8, 4, 1] or at test time [4], incurring much higher cost than a \u2018vanilla\u2019 NN; (2) as mentioned in [1], methods\n30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain.\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n00 44\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\nN ov\n2 01\nbased on online EP or VI do not involve sampling, but they need to compute the predictive density by integrating out the parameters, which is computationally inefficient; (3) these methods assume Gaussian distributions for the weights and neurons, allowing no flexibility to customize different distributions according to the data as is done in probabilistic graphical models (PGM).\nTo address the problems, we propose natural-parameter networks (NPN) as a class of probabilistic neural networks where the input, target output, weights, and neurons can all be modeled by arbitrary exponential-family distributions (e.g., Poisson distributions for word counts) instead of being limited to Gaussian distributions. Input distributions go through layers of linear and nonlinear transformation deterministically before producing distributions to match the target output distributions (previous work [21] shows that providing distributions as input by corrupting the data with noise plays the role of regularization). As byproducts, output distributions of intermediate layers may be used as second-order representations for the associated tasks. Thanks to the properties of the exponential family [3, 19], distributions in NPN are defined by the corresponding natural parameters which can be learned efficiently by backpropagation. Unlike [4, 1], NPN explicitly propagates the estimates of uncertainty back and forth in deep networks. This way the uncertainty estimates for each layer of neurons are readily available for the associated tasks. Our experiments show that such information is helpful when neurons of intermediate layers are used as representations like in autoencoders (AE). In summary, our main contributions are:\n\u2022 We propose NPN as a class of probabilistic neural networks. Our model combines the merits of NN and PGM in terms of computational efficiency and flexibility to customize the types of distributions for different types of data. \u2022 Leveraging the properties of the exponential family, some sampling-free backpropagationcompatible algorithms are designed to efficiently learn the distributions over weights by learning the natural parameters. \u2022 Unlike most probabilistic NN models, NPN obtains the uncertainty of intermediate-layer neurons as byproducts, which provide valuable information to the learned representations. Experiments on real-world datasets show that NPN can achieve state-of-the-art performance on classification, regression, and unsupervised representation learning tasks."}, {"heading": "2 Natural-Parameter Networks", "text": "The exponential family refers to an important class of distributions with useful algebraic properties. Distributions in the exponential family have the form p(x|\u03b7) = h(x)g(\u03b7) exp{\u03b7Tu(x)}, where x is the random variable, \u03b7 denotes the natural parameters, u(x) is a vector of sufficient statistics, and g(\u03b7) is the normalizer. For a given type of distributions, different choices of \u03b7 lead to different shapes. For example, a univariate Gaussian distribution with \u03b7 = (c, d)T corresponds to N (\u2212 c2d ,\u2212 1 2d ).\nMotivated by this observation, in NPN, only the natural parameters need to be learned to model the distributions over the weights and neurons. Consider an NPN which takes a vector random distribution (e.g., a multivariate Gaussian distribution) as input, multiplies it by a matrix random distribution, goes through nonlinear transformation, and outputs another distribution. Since all three distributions in the process can be specified by their natural parameters (given the types of distributions), learning and prediction of the network can actually operate in the space of natural parameters. For example, if we use element-wise (factorized) gamma distributions for both the weights and neurons, the NPN counterpart of a vanilla network only needs twice the number of free parameters (weights) and neurons since there are two natural parameters for each univariate gamma distribution."}, {"heading": "2.1 Notation and Conventions", "text": "We use boldface uppercase letters like W to denote matrices and boldface lowercase letters like b for vectors. Similarly, a boldface number (e.g., 1 or 0) represents a row vector or a matrix with identical entries. In NPN, o(l) is used to denote the values of neurons in layer l before nonlinear transformation and a(l) is for the values after nonlinear transformation. As mentioned above, NPN tries to learn distributions over variables rather than variables themselves. Hence we use letters without subscripts c, d, m, and s (e.g., o(l) and a(l)) to denote \u2018random variables\u2019 with corresponding distributions.

For simplicity, we assume distributions with two natural parameters (e.g., gamma distributions, beta distributions, and Gaussian distributions), \u03b7 = (c, d)T , in this section. Specifically, we have factorized distributions on the weight matrices, p(W(l)|W(l)c ,W(l)d ) = \u220f i,j p(W (l) ij |W (l) c,ij ,W (l) d,ij), where the pair (W (l) c,ij ,W (l) d,ij) is the corresponding natural parameters. For b(l), o(l), and a(l) we assume similar factorized distributions.\nIn a traditional NN, the linear transformation follows o(l) = a(l\u22121)W(l) + b(l) where a(l\u22121) is the output from the previous layer. In NN a(l\u22121), W(l), and b(l) are deterministic variables while in NPN they are exponential-family distributions, meaning that the result o(l) is also a distribution. For convenience of subsequent computation it is desirable to approximate o(l) using another exponentialfamily distribution. We can do this by matching the mean and variance. Specifically, after computing (W (l) m ,W (l) s ) = f(W (l) c ,W (l) d ) and (b (l) m ,b (l) s ) = f(b (l) c ,b (l) d ), we can get o (l) c and o (l) d through the mean o(l)m and variance o (l) s of o(l) as follows:\n(a(l\u22121)m ,a (l\u22121) s ) = f(a (l\u22121) c ,a (l\u22121) d ), o (l) m = a (l\u22121) m W (l) m + b (l) m , (1)\no(l)s = a (l\u22121) s W (l) s + a (l\u22121) s (W (l) m \u25e6W(l)m ) + (a(l\u22121)m \u25e6 a(l\u22121)m )W(l)s + b(l)s , (2)\n(o(l)c ,o (l) d ) = f \u22121(o(l)m ,o (l) s ), (3)\nwhere \u25e6 denotes the element-wise product and the bijective function f(\u00b7, \u00b7) maps the natural parameters of a distribution into its mean and variance (e.g., f(c, d) = ( c+1\u2212d , c+1 d2 ) in gamma distributions). Similarly we use f\u22121(\u00b7, \u00b7) to denote the inverse transformation. W(l)m , W(l)s , b(l)m , and b(l)s are the mean and variance of W(l) and b(l) obtained from the natural parameters. The computed o(l)m and o (l) s can then be used to recover o (l) c and o (l) d , which will subsequently facilitate the feedforward computation of the nonlinear transformation described in Section 2.3."}, {"heading": "2.3 Nonlinear Transformation in NPN", "text": "After we obtain the linearly transformed distribution over o(l) defined by natural parameters o(l)c and o\n(l) d , an element-wise nonlinear transformation v(\u00b7) (with a well defined inverse function v\u22121(\u00b7)) will be imposed. The resulting activation distribution is pa(a(l)) = po(v\u22121(a(l)))|v\u22121 \u2032 (a(l))|, where po is the factorized distribution over o(l) defined by (o(l)c ,o (l) d ).\nThough pa(a(l)) may not be an exponential-family distribution, we can approximate it with one, p(a(l)|a(l)c ,a(l)d ), by matching the first two moments. Once the mean a (l) m and variance a (l) s of pa(a(l)) are obtained, we can compute corresponding natural parameters with f\u22121(\u00b7, \u00b7) (approximation accuracy is sufficient according to preliminary experiments).

(4)\nHere the key computational challenge is computing the integrals in Equation (4). Closed-form solutions are needed for their efficient computation. If po(o|oc,od) is a Gaussian distribution, closedform solutions exist for common activation functions like tanh(x) and max(0, x) (details are in Section B.3). Unfortunately this is not the case for other distributions. Leveraging the convenient form of the exponential family, we find that it is possible to design activation functions so that the integrals for non-Gaussian distributions can also be expressed in closed form. Theorem 1. Assume an exponential-family distribution po(x|\u03b7) = h(x)g(\u03b7) exp{\u03b7Tu(x)}, where the vector u(x) = (u1(x), u2(x), . . . , uM (x))T (M is the number of natural parameters).

Unlike PGM in general, however, NPN does not need costly inference algorithms like variational inference or Markov chain Monte Carlo. For some chain-structured PGM (e.g, hidden Markov models), efficient inference algorithms also exist due to their special structure. Similarly, the Markov property enables NPN to be efficiently trained in an end-to-end backpropagation learning fashion in the space of natural parameters.\n1Although the approximation accuracy may decrease as NPN gets deeper during feedforward computation, it can be automatically adjusted according to data during backpropagation.\n2Note that since the first part of Equation (1) and the last part of Equation (4) are canceled out, we can directly use (a(l)m ,a (l) s ) without computing (a (l) c ,a (l) d ) here.\nPGM is known to be more flexible than NN in the sense that it can choose different distributions to depict different relationships among variables. A major drawback of PGM is its scalability especially when the PGM is deep. Different from PGM, NN stacks relatively simple computational layers and learns the parameters using backpropagation, which is computationally more efficient than most algorithms for PGM. NPN has the potential to get the best of both worlds. In terms of flexibility, different types of exponential-family distributions can be chosen for the weights and neurons. Using gamma distributions for both the weights and neurons in NPN leads to a deep and nonlinear version of nonnegative matrix factorization [14] while an NPN with the Bernoulli distribution and sigmoid activation resembles a Bayesian treatment of sigmoid belief networks [17]. If Poisson distributions are chosen for the neurons, NPN becomes a neural analogue of deep Poisson factor analysis [26, 9].\nNote that similar to the weight decay in NN, we may add the KL divergence between the prior distributions and the learned distributions on the weights to the error E for regularization (we use isotropic Gaussian priors in the experiments). In NPN, the chosen prior distributions correspond to priors in Bayesian models and the learned distributions correspond to the approximation of posterior distributions on weights. Note that the generative story assumed here is that weights are sampled from the prior, and then output is generated (given all data) from these weights."}, {"heading": "3 Variants of NPN", "text": "In this section, we introduce three NPN variants with different properties to demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of NPN. Note that in practice we use a transformed version of the natural parameters, referred to as proxy natural parameters here, instead of the original ones for computational efficiency. For example, in gamma distributions p(x|c, d) = \u0393(c)\u22121dcxc\u22121 exp(\u2212dx), we use proxy natural parameters (c, d) during computation rather than the natural parameters (c\u2212 1,\u2212d)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Gamma NPN", "text": "The gamma distribution with support over positive values is an important member of the exponential family.

If we assume gamma distributions for W(l), b(l), o(l), and a(l), an AE formed by NPN becomes a deep and nonlinear version of nonnegative matrix factorization [14]. To see this, note that this AE with activation v(x) = x and zero biases b(l) is equivalent to finding a factorization of matrix X such that X = H \u220fL l=L2 W(l) where H denotes the middle-layer neurons and W(l) has nonnegative entries from gamma distributions. In this gamma NPN, parameters W(l)c , W (l) d , b (l) c , and b (l) d can be learned following Algorithm 2. We detail the algorithm as follows:\nLinear Transformation: Since gamma distributions are assumed here, we can use the function f(c, d) = ( cd , c d2 ) to compute (W (l) m ,W (l) s ) = f(W (l) c ,W (l) d ), (b (l) m ,b (l) s ) = f(b (l) c ,b (l) d ), and (o (l) c ,o (l) d ) = f \u22121(o (l) m ,o (l) s ) during the probabilistic linear transformation in Equation (1)-(3).\nNonlinear Transformation: With the proxy natural parameters for the gamma distributions over o(l), the mean a(l)m and variance a (l) s for the nonlinearly transformed distribution over a(l) would be obtained with Equation (4). Following Theorem 2, closed-form solutions are possible with v(x) = r(1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03c4x)) (r = q and ui(x) = x) where r and \u03c4 are constants.

Details of Algorithm 2 for Gaussian NPN are as follows:\nLinear Transformation: Besides support over real values, another property of Gaussian distributions is that the mean and variance can be used as proxy natural parameters, leading to an identity mapping function f(c, d) = (c, d) which cuts the computation cost.

For reference, the error rate for dropout NN with 1600 neurons in each hidden layer is 1.40%. The time cost per epoch is 18.3s, 16.2s, and 6.4s for NPN, BDK, NN respectively. Note that BDK is in C++ and NPN is in Matlab.\nTo evaluate NPN\u2019s ability as a Bayesian treatment to avoid overfitting, we vary the size of the training set (from 100 to 10,000 data points) and compare the test error rates. As shown in Table 3, the margin between the Gaussian NPN and dropout NN increases as the training set shrinks. Besides, to verify the effectiveness of the estimated uncertainty, we split the test set into 9 subsets according NPN\u2019s estimated variance (uncertainty) a(L)s 1T for each sample and show the accuracy for each subset in Figure 2. We can find that the more uncertain NPN is, the lower the accuracy, indicating that the estimated uncertainty is well calibrated."}, {"heading": "4.3 Second-Order Representation Learning", "text": "Besides classification and regression, we also consider the problem of unsupervised representation learning with a subsequent link prediction task. Three real-world datasets, Citeulike-a, Citeulike-t, and arXiv, are used. The first two datasets are from [22, 23], collected separately from CiteULike in different ways to mimic different real-world settings. The third one is from arXiv as one of the SNAP datasets [15]. Citeulike-a consists of 16,980 documents, 8,000 terms, and 44,709 links (citations). Citeulike-t consists of 25,975 documents, 20,000 terms, and 32,565 links. The last dataset, arXiv, consists of 27,770 documents, 8,000 terms, and 352,807 links.\nThe task is to perform unsupervised representation learning before feeding the extracted representations (middle-layer neurons) into a Bayesian LR algorithm [3]. We use the stacked autoencoder (SAE) [7], stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) [21], variational autoencoder (VAE) [13] as baselines (hyperparameters like weight decay and dropout rate are chosen by cross validation). As in SAE, we use different variants of NPN to form autoencoders where both the input and output targets are bag-of-words (BOW) vectors for the documents. The network structure for all models is B-100-50 (B is the number of terms). Please refer to the supplementary material for detailed hyperparameters.\nOne major advantage of NPN over SAE and SDAE is that the learned representations are distributions instead of point estimates. Since representations from NPN contain both the mean and variance, we call them secondorder representations. Note that although VAE also produces second-order representations, the variance part is simply parameterized by multilayer perceptrons while NPN\u2019s variance is naturally computed through propagation of distributions. These 50-dimensional representations with both mean and variance are fed into a Bayesian LR algorithm for link prediction (for deterministic AE the variance is set to 0).\nWe use links among 80% of the nodes (documents) to train the Bayesian LR and use other links as the test set. link rank and AUC (area under the ROC curve) are used as evaluation metrics. The link rank is the average rank of the observed links from test nodes to training nodes. We compute the AUC for every test node and report the average values. By definition, lower link rank and higher AUC indicate better predictive performance and imply more powerful representations.\nTable 4 shows the link rank for different models. For fair comparison we also try all baselines with double budget (a structure of B-200-50) and report whichever has higher accuracy. As we can see, by treating representations as distributions rather than points in a vector space, NPN is able to achieve much lower link rank than all baselines, including VAE with variance information. The numbers in the brackets show the link rank of NPN if we discard the variance information. The performance gain from variance information verifies the effectiveness of the variance (uncertainty) estimated by NPN. Among different variants of NPN, the Gaussian NPN seems to perform better in datasets with fewer words like Citeulike-t (only 18.8 words per document). The Poisson NPN, as a more natural choice to model text, achieves the best performance in datasets with more words (Citeulike-a and arXiv). The performance in AUC is consistent with that in terms of the link rank (see Section D of the supplementary material). To further verify the effectiveness of the estimated uncertainty, we plot the reconstruction error and the variance o(L)s 1T for each data point of Citeulike-a in Figure 3. As we can see, higher uncertainty often indicates not only higher reconstruction error E but also higher variance in E."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We have introduced a family of models, called natural-parameter networks, as a novel class of probabilistic NN to combine the merits of NN and PGM. NPN regards the weights and neurons as arbitrary exponential-family distributions rather than just point estimates or factorized Gaussian distributions. Such flexibility enables richer descriptions of hierarchical relationships among latent variables and adds another degree of freedom to customize NN for different types of data. Efficient sampling-free backpropagation-compatible algorithms are designed for the learning of NPN. Experiments show that\nNPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification, regression, and representation learning tasks. As possible extensions of NPN, it would be interesting to connect NPN to arbitrary PGM to form fully Bayesian deep learning models [24, 25], allowing even richer descriptions of relationships among latent variables. It is also worth noting that NPN cannot be defined as generative models and, unlike PGM, the same NPN model cannot be used to support multiple types of inference (with different observed and hidden variables). We will try to address these limitations in our future work."}, {"heading": "A Proof of Theorem 2", "text": "Theorem 2.

Lemma 1. Assume Y is a Poisson random variable with mean c and variance c. If X1, X2, . . . , Xc are independent Poisson random variables with mean 1, we have:\nY = c\u2211 i=1 Xi\nProof. We can use the concept of moment generating functions (i.e., two distributions are identical if they have exactly the same moment generating function), which is defined as M(t) = E(exp(tZ)) for a random variable Z, to prove the lemma. The moment generating function for a Poisson random variable with mean c and variance c is:\nM1(t) = exp(c(exp(t)\u2212 1)).\nOn the other hand, the moment generating function for c\u2211 i=1 Xi is:\nM2(t) = E(exp(t c\u2211 i=1 Xi))\n= E( c\u220f i=1 exp(tXi))\n= c\u220f i=1 E(exp(tXi)) (12)\n= c\u220f i=1 exp(exp(t)\u2212 1) (13)\n= exp(c(exp(t)\u2212 1)) = M1(t),\nwhere Equation (12) is due to the fact that X1, X2, . . . , Xc are independent. Equation (13) is the result of using the moment generating functions of Poisson distributions. Since c\u2211 i=1 Xi has exactly the same moment generating function as a Poisson random variable with mean c and variance c, by definition of Y , we have:\nY = c\u2211 i=1 Xi\nTheorem 4. A Poisson distribution with mean c and variance c can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution N (c, c) if c is sufficiently large.\nProof. We first use Y to denote the random variable corresponding to the Poisson distribution with mean c and variance c. According to Lemma 1, we have Y = c\u2211 i=1 Xi where X1, X2, . . . , Xc are\nindependent Poisson random variables with mean 1.

By the central limit theorem, we know that if c is sufficiently large, \u221a c( 1c c\u2211 i=1 Xi \u2212 1) can be approximated by the Gaussian distribution N (0, 1). Thus Y can be approximated by the Gaussian distribution N (c, c).\nNote that although c is a nonnegative integer above, the proof can be easily generalized to the case in which c is a nonnegative real value.\nDuring the feedforward computation of the Poisson NPN, after obtaining the mean o(l)m and variance o (l) s of the linearly transformed distribution over o(l), we map them back to the proxy natural parameters o(l)c . Unfortunately the mean and variance of a Poisson are the same, which is obviously not the case for o(l)m and o (l) s . Here we propose to find o (l) c by minimizing the KL divergence of the factorized Poisson distribution p(o(l)|o(l)c ) and the Gaussian distribution N (o(l)m , diag(o(l)s ))3. Since the direct KL divergence involves the computation of an infinite series in the entropy term of the Poisson distribution, closed-form solutions are not available. To address the problem, we use a Gaussian distribution N (o(l)c , diag(o(l)c )) as a proxy of the Poisson distribution with the mean o(l)c (which is justified by Theorem 4)4. Specifically, we aim to find a Gaussian distribution N (o(l)c , diag(o(l)c )) to best approximateN (o(l)m , diag(o(l)s )) and directly use o(l)c in the new Gaussian as the result of mapping.\nFor simplicity, we consider the univariate case where we aim to find a Gaussian distribution N (c, c) to approximate N (m, s). The KL divergence between N (c, c) and N (m, s)\nDKL(N (c, c)\u2016N (m, s)) = 1 2 ( c s +\n(c\u2212m)2\ns \u2212 1 + log s\u2212 log c),\nwhich is convex with respect to c > 0. We set the gradient of DKL(N (c, c)\u2016N (m, s)) with respect to c as 0 and solve for c, giving\nc = 2m\u2212 1\u00b1 \u221a (2m\u2212 1)2 + 8s 4 .\nSince in Poisson distributions, c is always positive, there is only one solution for c:\nc = 2m\u2212 1 + \u221a (2m\u2212 1)2 + 8s 4 .\nThus the mapping is\no(l)c = 1\n4 (2o(l)m \u2212 1 +\n\u221a (2o (l) m \u2212 1)2 + 8o(l)s ).\n3The relationships between Poisson distributions and Gaussian distributions are described in Theorem 4. The theorem, however, cannot be directly used here since o(l)m and o (l) s are not identical. This is why we have to resort to the KL divergence. 4Note that for Theorem 4 to be valid, c has to be sufficiently large, which is why we do not normalize the word counts as preprocessing and why we use a large r for the activation v(x) = r(1\u2212 exp(\u2212\u03c4x))."}, {"heading": "D AUC for Link Prediction and Different Data Splitting", "text": "In this section, we show the AUC for different models on the link prediction task.

As mentioned before, using traditional activation functions like tanh v(x) = tanh(x) and ReLU v(x) = max(0, x) could not give us closed-form solutions for the integrals.

Different from the previous distributions, it has support over nonnegative integers. The Poisson distribution takes the form p(x|c) = c\nx exp(\u2212c) x! with one single natural parameter log c (we use c as the proxy natural parameter).\nIt is this single natural parameter that makes the learning of a Poisson NPN trickier. For text modeling, assuming Poisson distributions for neurons is natural because they can model the counts of words and topics (even super topics) in documents. Here we assume a factorized Poisson distribution p(o(l)|o(l)c ) = \u220f j p(o (l) j |o (l) c,j) and do the same for a\n(l). To ensure having positive natural parameters we use gamma distributions for the weights. Interestingly, this design of Poisson NPN can be seen as a neural analogue of some Poisson factor analysis models [26].\nFollowing Algorithm 2, we need to compute E during the feedforward phase given the input a(0)m = x (a(0)s = 0) and the parameters (W (l) c , W (l) d , b (l) c , and b (l) d ), the first step being to compute the mean o (l) m and variance o (l) s . Since gamma distributions are assumed for the weights, we can compute the mean and variance of the weights as follows:\n(W(l)m ,W (l) s ) = (W (l) c \u25e6W (l) d \u22121 ,W(l)c \u25e6W (l) d \u22122 ), (b(l)m ,b (l) s ) = (b (l) c \u25e6 b (l) d \u22121 ,b(l)c \u25e6 b (l) d \u22122 ). (17)\nHaving computed the mean o(l)m and variance o (l) s of the linearly transformed distribution over o(l), we map them back to the proxy natural parameters o(l)c . Unfortunately the mean and variance of a Poisson are the same, which is obviously not the case for o(l)m and o (l) s . Hence we propose to find o (l) c by minimizing the KL divergence of the factorized Poisson distribution p(o(l)|o(l)c ) and the Gaussian distribution N (o(l)m , diag(o(l)s )), resulting in the mapping (see Section C for proofs and justifications):\no(l)c = 1\n4 (2o(l)m \u2212 1 +\n\u221a (2o (l) m \u2212 1)2 + 8o(l)s ). (18)\nAfter finding o(l)c , the next step in Algorithm 2 is to get the mean a (l) m and variance a (l) s of the nonlinearly transformed distribution. As is the case for gamma NPN, traditional activation functions will not give us closed-form solutions. Fortunately, the activation v(x) = r(1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03c4x)) also works for Poisson NPN. Specifically,\nam = r +\u221e\u2211 x=0 oxc exp(\u2212oc) x! (1\u2212 exp(\u2212\u03c4x)) = r(1\u2212 exp((exp(\u2212\u03c4)\u2212 1)oc)),\nwhere the superscript (l) is dropped.

Assuming that the target output y has nonnegative integers as entries,\nE = \u22121T (y \u25e6 log o(L)c \u2212 o(L)c \u2212 log(y!)).\nFor y with real-valued entries, the L2 loss could be used as the error E. Note that if we use the normalized BOW as the target output, the same error E can be used as the Gaussian NPN. Besides this loss term, we can add the KL divergence term in Equation (15) to regularize Poisson NPN.\nDuring backpropagation, the gradients are computed to update the parameters W(l)c , W (l) d , b (l) c , and b(l)d .

state-of-the-art performance in various applications. Unfortunately in applications where training data is insufficient, they are often prone to overfitting. One effective way to alleviate this problem is to exploit the Bayesian approach by using Bayesian neural networks (BNN). Another shortcoming of NN is the lack of flexibility to customize different distributions for the weights and neurons according to the data, as is often done in probabilistic graphical models. To address these problems, we propose a class of probabilistic neural networks, dubbed natural-parameter networks (NPN), as a novel and lightweight Bayesian treatment of NN. NPN allows the usage of arbitrary exponential-family distributions to model the weights and neurons. Different from traditional NN and BNN, NPN takes distributions as input and goes through layers of transformation before producing distributions to match the target output distributions. As a Bayesian treatment, efficient backpropagation (BP) is performed to learn the natural parameters for the distributions over both the weights and neurons. The output distributions of each layer, as byproducts, may be used as second-order representations for the associated tasks such as link prediction. Experiments on real-world datasets show that NPN can achieve state-of-the-art performance.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
