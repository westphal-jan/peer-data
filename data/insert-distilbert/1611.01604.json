Previous QA datasets tend to be high in quality due to human annotation, but small in size (Berant et al., 2014; Richardson et al., 2013). Hence, they did not allow for training data-intensive, expressive models such as deep neural networks.\nTo address this problem, researchers have developed large-scale datasets through semi-automated techniques (Hermann et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2015). Compared to their smaller, hand-annotated counterparts, these QA datasets allow the training of more expressive models. However, it has been shown that they differ from more natural, human annotated datasets in the types of reasoning required to answer the questions (Chen et al., 2016).\nRecently, Rajpurkar et al. (2016) released the Stanford Question Answering dataset (SQuAD), which is orders of magnitude larger than all previous hand-annotated datasets and has a variety of qualities that culminate in a natural QA task. SQuAD has the desirable quality that answers are spans in a reference document. This constrains answers to the space of all possible spans. However, Rajpurkar et al. (2016) show that the dataset retains a diverse set of answers and requires different forms of logical reasoning, including multi-sentence reasoning.\nWe introduce the Dynamic Coattention Network (DCN), illustrated in Fig. 1, an end-to-end neural network for question answering. The model consists of a coattentive encoder that captures the interactions between the question and the document, as well as a dynamic pointing decoder that alternates between estimating the start and end of the answer span. Our single model obtains an F1 of 75.9% compared to the best published result of 71.0% (Yu et al., 2016). In addition, our ensemble model obtains an F1 of 80.4% compared to the second best result of 78.1% on the official SQuAD leaderboard.1\n\u2217Equal contribution 1As of Nov. 3 2016.

Using an LSTM (Hochreiter\n& Schmidhuber, 1997), we encode the document as: dt = LSTMenc ( dt\u22121, x D t ) . We define the document encoding matrix as D = [d1 . . . dn d\u2205] \u2208 R`\u00d7(m+1). We also add a sentinel vector d\u2205 (Merity et al., 2016), which we later show allows the model to not attend to any particular word in the input.\nThe question embeddings are computed with the same LSTM to share representation power: qt = LSTMenc ( qt\u22121, x Q t ) . We define an intermediate question representation Q\u2032 = [q1 . . . qm q\u2205] \u2208\nR`\u00d7(n+1). To allow for variation between the question encoding space and the document encoding space, we introduce a non-linear projection layer on top of the question encoding. The final representation for the question becomes: Q = tanh ( W (Q)Q\u2032 + b(Q) ) \u2208 R`\u00d7(n+1)."}, {"heading": "2.2 COATTENTION ENCODER", "text": "We propose a coattention mechanism that attends to the question and document simultaneously, similar to (Lu et al., 2016), and finally fuses both attention contexts. Figure 2 provides an illustration of the coattention encoder.\nWe first compute the affinity matrix, which contains affinity scores corresponding to all pairs of document words and question words: L = D>Q \u2208 R(m+1)\u00d7(n+1). The affinity matrix is normalized row-wise to produce the attention weights AQ across the document for each word in the question, and column-wise to produce the attention weights AD across the question for each word in the document:\nAQ = softmax (L) \u2208 R(m+1)\u00d7(n+1) and AD = softmax ( L> ) \u2208 R(n+1)\u00d7(m+1) (1)\nNext, we compute the summaries, or attention contexts, of the document in light of each word of the question.\nCQ = DAQ \u2208 R`\u00d7(n+1). (2)\nWe similarly compute the summaries QAD of the question in light of each word of the document. Similar to Cui et al. (2016), we also compute the summaries CQAD of the previous attention contexts in light of each word of the document. These two operations can be done in parallel, as is shown in Eq. 3. One possible interpretation for the operation CQAD is the mapping of question encoding into space of document encodings.\nCD = [ Q;CQ ] AD \u2208 R2`\u00d7(m+1). (3)\nWe define CD, a co-dependent representation of the question and document, as the coattention context. We use the notation [a; b] for concatenating the vectors a and b horizontally.\nThe last step is the fusion of temporal information to the coattention context via a bidirectional LSTM: ut = Bi-LSTM ( ut\u22121, ut+1, [ dt; c D t ]) \u2208 R2`. (4)\nWe define U = [u1, . . . , um] \u2208 R`\u00d7m , which provides a foundation for selecting which span may be the best possible answer, as the coattention encoding."}, {"heading": "2.3 DYNAMIC POINTING DECODER", "text": "Due to the nature of SQuAD, an intuitive method for producing the answer span is by predicting the start and end points of the span (Wang & Jiang, 2016). However, given a question-document pair, there may exist several intuitive answer spans within the document, each corresponding to a local maxima. We propose an iterative technique to select an answer span by alternating between predicting the start point and predicting the end point. This iterative procedure allows the model to recover from initial local maxima corresponding to incorrect answer spans.\nFigure 3 provides an illustration of the Dynamic Decoder, which is similar to a state machine whose state is maintained by an LSTM-based sequential model. During each iteration, the decoder updates its state taking into account the coattention encoding corresponding to current estimates of the start and end positions, and produces, via a multilayer neural network, new estimates of the start and end positions.\nLet hi, si, and ei denote the hidden state of the LSTM, the estimate of the position, and the estimate of the end position during iteration i. The LSTM state update is then described by Eq. 5.\nhi = LSTM dec ( hi\u22121, [ usi\u22121 ;uei\u22121 ]) (5)\nwhere usi\u22121 and uei\u22121 are the representations corresponding to the previous estimate of the start and end positions in the coattention encoding U .\nGiven the current hidden state hi, previous start position usi\u22121 , and previous end position uei\u22121 , we estimate the current start position and end position via Eq. 6 and Eq. 7.\nsi = argmax t (\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1m) (6)\nei = argmax t (\u03b21, . . . , \u03b2m) (7)\nwhere \u03b1t and \u03b2t represent the start score and end score corresponding to the tth word in the document. We compute \u03b1t and \u03b2t with separate neural networks. These networks have the same architecture but do not share parameters.\nBased on the strong empirical performance of Maxout Networks (Goodfellow et al., 2013) and Highway Networks (Srivastava et al., 2015), especially with regards to deep architectures, we propose a Highway Maxout Network (HMN) to compute \u03b1t as described by Eq. 8. The intuition behind using such model is that the QA task consists of multiple question types and document topics. These variations may require different models to estimate the answer span. Maxout provides a simple and effective way to pool across multiple model variations.\n\u03b1t = HMN start ( ut, hi, usi\u22121 , uei\u22121 ) (8)\nHere, ut is the coattention encoding corresponding to the tth word in the document. HMN start is illustrated in Figure 4. The end score, \u03b2t, is computed similarly to the start score \u03b1t, but using a separate HMN end.\nWe now describe the HMN model:\nHMN ( ut, hi, usi\u22121 , uei\u22121 ) = max ( W (3) [ m (1) t ;m (2) t ] + b(3) ) (9)\nr = tanh ( W (D) [ hi;usi\u22121 ;uei\u22121 ]) (10)\nm (1) t = max ( W (1) [ut; r] + b (1) )\n(11)\nm (2) t = max\n( W (2)m\n(1) t + b\n(2) )\n(12)\nwhere r \u2208 R` is a non-linear projection of the current state with parameters W (D) \u2208 R`\u00d75`, m\n(1) t is the output of the first maxout layer with parameters W (1) \u2208 Rp\u00d7`\u00d76` and b(1) \u2208 Rp\u00d7`, and m(2)t is the output of the second maxout layer with parameters W (2) \u2208 Rp\u00d7`\u00d7` and b(2) \u2208 Rp\u00d7`. m(1)t and m (2) t are fed into the final maxout layer, which has parameters W (3) \u2208 Rp\u00d71\u00d72`, and b(3) \u2208 Rp. p is the pooling size of each maxout layer. The max operation computes the maximum value over the first dimension of a tensor. We note that there is highway connection between the output of the first maxout layer and the last maxout layer.\nTo train the network, we minimize the cumulative softmax cross entropy of the start and end points across all iterations. The iterative procedure halts when both the estimate of the start position and the estimate of the end position no\nlonger change, or when a maximum number of iterations is reached. Details can be found in Section 4.1"}, {"heading": "3 RELATED WORK", "text": "Statistical QA Traditional approaches to question answering typically involve rule-based algorithms or linear classifiers over hand-engineered feature sets. Richardson et al. (2013) proposed two baselines, one that uses simple lexical features such as a sliding window to match bags of words, and another that uses word-distances between words in the question and in the document. Berant et al. (2014) proposed an alternative approach in which one first learns a structured representation of the entities and relations in the document in the form of a knowledge base, then converts the question to a structured query with which to match the content of the knowledge base. Wang & McAllester (2015) described a statistical model using frame semantic features as well as syntactic features such as part of speech tags and dependency parses. Chen et al. (2016) proposed a competitive statistical baseline using a variety of carefully crafted lexical, syntactic, and word order features.\nNeural QA Neural attention models have been widely applied for machine comprehension or question-answering in NLP. Hermann et al. (2015) proposed an AttentiveReader model with the release of the CNN/Daily Mail cloze-style question answering dataset. Hill et al. (2015) released another dataset steming from the children\u2019s book and proposed a window-based memory network. Kadlec et al. (2016) presented a pointer-style attention mechanism but performs only one attention step. Sordoni et al. (2016) introduced an iterative neural attention model and applied it to cloze-style machine comprehension tasks.\nRecently, Rajpurkar et al. (2016) released the SQuAD dataset. Different from cloze-style queries, answers include non-entities and longer phrases, and questions are more realistic. For SQuAD, Wang & Jiang (2016) proposed an end-to-end neural network model that consists of a Match-LSTM encoder, originally introduced in Wang & Jiang (2015), and a pointer network decoder (Vinyals et al., 2015); Yu et al. (2016) introduced a dynamic chunk reader, a neural reading comprehension model that extracts a set of answer candidates of variable lengths from the document and ranks them to answer the question.\nLu et al. (2016) proposed a hierarchical co-attention model for visual question answering, which achieved state of the art result on the COCO-VQA dataset (Antol et al., 2015). In (Lu et al., 2016), the co-attention mechanism computes a conditional representation of the image given the question, as well as a conditional representation of the question given the image.\nInspired by the above works, we propose a dynamic coattention model (DCN) that consists of a novel coattentive encoder and dynamic decoder. In our model, instead of estimating the start and\nend positions of the answer span in a single pass (Wang & Jiang, 2016), we iteratively update the start and end positions in a similar fashion to the Iterative Conditional Modes algorithm (Besag, 1986)."}, {"heading": "4 EXPERIMENTS", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.1 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS", "text": "We train and evaluate our model on the SQuAD dataset. To preprocess the corpus, we use the tokenizer from Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014). We use as GloVe word vectors pretrained on the 840B Common Crawl corpus (Pennington et al., 2014). We limit the vocabulary to words that are present in the Common Crawl corpus and set embeddings for out-of-vocabulary words to zero. Empirically, we found that training the embeddings consistently led to overfitting and subpar performance, and hence only report results with fixed word embeddings.\nWe use a max sequence length of 600 during training and a hidden state size of 200 for all recurrent units, maxout layers, and linear layers. For the dynamic decoder, we set the maximum number of iterations to 4 and use a maxout pool size of 32. We use dropout to regularize our network during training (Srivastava et al., 2014), and optimize the model using ADAM (Kingma & Ba, 2014). All models are implemented and trained with Chainer (Tokui et al., 2015)."}, {"heading": "4.2 RESULTS", "text": "Evaluation on the SQuAD dataset consists of two metrics. The exact match score (EM) calculates the exact string match between the predicted answer and a ground truth answer. The F1 score calculates the overlap between words in the predicted answer and a ground truth answer. Because a document-question pair may have several ground truth answers, the EM and F1 for a documentquestion pair is taken to be the maximum value across all ground truth answers. The overall metric is then computed by averaging over all document-question pairs. The offical SQuAD evaluation is hosted on CodaLab 2. The training and development sets are publicly available while the test set is withheld.\n2https://worksheets.codalab.org\nThe performance of the Dynamic Coattention Network on the SQuAD dataset, compared to other submitted models on the leaderboard 3, is shown in Table 4.2. At the time of writing, our singlemodel DCN ranks first at 66.2% exact match and 75.9% F1 on the test data among single-model submissions. Our ensemble DCN ranks first overall at 71.6% exact match and 80.4% F1 on the test data.\nThe DCN has the capability to estimate the start and end points of the answer span multiple times, each time conditioned on its previous estimates. By doing so, the model is able to explore local maxima corresponding to multiple plausible answers, as is shown in Figure 5.\nFor example, Question 1 in Figure 5 demonstrates an instance where the model initially guesses an incorrect start point and a correct end point. In subsequent iterations, the model adjusts the start point, ultimately arriving at the correct start point in iteration 3. Similarly, the model gradually shifts probability mass for the end point to the correct word.\nQuestion 2 shows an example in which both the start and end estimates are initially incorrect. The model then settles on the correct answer in the next iteration.\n3https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer\nWhile the dynamic nature of the decoder allows the model to escape initial local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers, Question 3 demonstrates a case where the model is unable to decide between multiple local maxima despite several iterations. Namely, the model alternates between the answers \u201ccharged particle beam\u201d and \u201cparticle beam weapons\u201d indefinitely. Empirically, we observe that the model, trained with a maximum iteration of 4, takes 2.7 iterations to converge to an answer on average.\nPerformance across length One point of interest is how the performance of the DCN varies with respect to the length of document. Intuitively, we expect the model performance to deteriorate with longer examples, as is the case with neural machine translation (Luong et al., 2015). However, as in shown in Figure 6, there is no notable performance degradation for longer documents and questions contrary to our expectations. This suggests that the coattentive encoder is largely agnostic to long documents, and is able to focus on small sections of relevant text while ignoring the rest of the (potentially very long) document. We do note a performance degradation with longer answers. However, this is intuitive given the nature of the evaluation metric. Namely, it becomes increasingly challenging to compute the correct word span as the number of words increases.\nPerformance across question type Another natural way to analyze the performance of the model is to examine its performance across question types. In Figure 7, we note that the mean F1 of DCN exceeds those of previous systems (Wang & Jiang, 2016; Yu et al., 2016) across all question types. The DCN, like other models, is adept at \u201cwhen\u201d questions and struggles with the more complex \u201cwhy\u201d questions.\nBreakdown of F1 distribution Finally, we note that the DCN performance is highly bimodal. On the development set, the model perfectly predicts (100% F1) an answer for 62.2% of examples and predicts a completely wrong answer (0% F1) for 16.3% of examples. That is, the model picks out partial answers only 21.5% of the time. Upon qualitative inspections of the 0% F1 answers, some of which are shown in Appendix A.2, we observe that when the model\nis wrong, its mistakes tend to have the correct \u201canswer type\u201d (eg. person for a \u201cwho\u201d question, method for a \u201chow\u201d question) and the answer boundaries encapsulate a well-defined phrase."}, {"heading": "5 CONCLUSION", "text": "We proposed the Dynamic Coattention Network, an end-to-end neural network architecture for question answering.

This suggests that the model has trouble discerning among multiple intuitive answers due to a lack of understanding of the relative severity of \u201cmore or less\u201d versus \u201csometimes\u201d and \u201cother times\u201d."}], "references": [{"title": "Vqa: Visual question answering", "author": ["Stanislaw Antol", "Aishwarya Agrawal", "Jiasen Lu", "Margaret Mitchell", "Dhruv Batra", "C Lawrence Zitnick", "Devi Parikh"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp", "citeRegEx": "Antol et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Antol et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Modeling biological processes for reading comprehension", "author": ["Jonathan Berant", "Vivek Srikumar", "Pei-Chun Chen", "Abby Vander Linden", "Brittany Harding", "Brad Huang", "Peter Clark", "Christopher D Manning"], "venue": "In EMNLP,", "citeRegEx": "Berant et al\\.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Berant et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "On the statistical analysis of dirty pictures", "author": ["Julian Besag"], "venue": "Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

However, due to their single-pass nature, they have no way to recover from local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers. To address this problem, we introduce the Dynamic Coattention Network (DCN) for question answering. The DCN first fuses co-dependent representations of the question and the document in order to focus on relevant parts of both. Then a dynamic pointing decoder iterates over potential answer spans. This iterative procedure enables the model to recover from initial local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers. On the Stanford question answering dataset, a single DCN model improves the previous state of the art from 71.0% F1 to 75.9%, while a DCN ensemble obtains 80.4% F1.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
