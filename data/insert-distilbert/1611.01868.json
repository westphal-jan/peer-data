For example, different booking sites provide different boarding time about the same flight on the same date. The phenomenon seriously affects people\u2019s life. Truth discovery task is to find the most credible statement to resolve the confliction (Yin et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2009; Galland et al., 2010). The development of the research benefit other natural language processing task like knowledge management (Poston and Speier, 2005), question answering (Banerjee and Han, 2009), information retrieval (Olteanu et al., 2013) and so on.\nPrevious methods mostly take voting mechanism through predicting the truth (Yin et al., 2008; Snow et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2009; Galland et al., 2010; Dong et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014a; Li et al., 2016; Pasternack and Dan, 2010). They consider the mutual effect between the reliability of sources and the credibility of statements; however, they mostly ignore the mutual effect among the credibility of statements. It is necessary to incorporate the effect from other statements of the same object when computing the credibility of the current statement. Another challenge is that there are multiple types of data in the real world, like categorical data and continuous data, which are both helpful in evaluating the reliability of sources. Few approaches jointly use multiple types of data to learn source reliability and predict the truth. CRH method first presente a framework to joint two types of data and is the state-of-the-art method. However it treats two types of data equally during the reliability evaluating which is intuitively not.\nWe propose memory network based models to learn source reliability and predict the credibility of statements. Given an object, the statements from multiple sources with different reliability can be treated as context to each other. We use feedforward memory network (FFMN) and feedback memory network (FBMN) to incorporate the effect of the credibility between statements. The two models both use memory component to store and update the reliability of sources. We propose a revised framework to utilize multiple types data and assign different weights based on the effect of different types data in model learning. The proposed methods have been verified effectiveness through the experiments on public gold standard datasets.

We convert the network-structure data into vectorial representation and input multiple-source statements of one object as context to predict the truth. The reliability of sources are stored as memories in FFMN and FBMN to help in computing the credibility of statements.\n\u2022 For better learning the reliability of sources, we proposed a framework to jointly utilize categorical data and continuous data. We weightily combine loss functions of two types of data, in which the weights are fine-tuned automatically through model optimization.\n\u2022 Through experiments, we verify that memory network based models outperform the state-of-the-art method, and specifically FFMN works better than other neural network models."}, {"heading": "2 Methodology", "text": "We first make a formulation of the problem. Then we introduce the framework and central functions."}, {"heading": "2.1 Problem Formulation", "text": "In the real world, the statement is a naturally existing information unit which is the description of a thing of an event. We can always draw an object and a property from the statement, which compose an entry (Li et al., 2014b). The observation is the value of the entry. According to the same entry, observations from different sources may contain conflicting values. The goal of the prediction model is to find the correct observation of the entry.\nEXAMPLE 1. \u201cThe flight AA-2446-LAX-DFW will take off at 01:19 PM\u201d is a statement. \u201cThe flight AA-2446-LAX-DFW\u201d is an object and \u201ctakeoff time\u201d is a property. \u201cThe takeoff time of flight AA-2446-LAX-DFW\u201d is an entry. The observation of the entry \u201cthe takeoff time of flight AA-2446-LAX-DFW\u201d is \u201c01:19 PM\u201d.\nThe object may have more than one property in a statement, and we separate it into multiple entries. In other words, we take an entry as the basic unit in the prediction model, and the credibility of the observations drew from same statement will be evaluated separately.\nEXAMPLE 2. \u201cThe flight AA-2446-LAX-DFW will take off at 01:19 PM at gate 42B\u201d has two entries, \u201cthe takeoff time of AA-2446-LAX-DFW\u201d and \u201cthe gate of AA-2446-LAX-DFW\u201d.\nActually, there are two data types in the observations which are categorical data and continuous data. The categorical data is class-style data. The continuous data is a number, or can be converted into real number. By prediction model, we want to predict the correct category for categorical type data and predict the closest value to the true value for continuous type data.\nEXAMPLE 3. The \u201cgate 42B\u201d is categorical data, and \u201c01:19 PM\u201d can be treated as continuous data by converting into minutes.\nSuppose there are N entries, each of which has K observations offered by K sources {s1, s2, ..., sK}. Given an entry ei, the observations are the value set Vi = {vi1, vi2, ..., viK}."}, {"heading": "2.2 Basic Framework", "text": "In the direction of truth discovery, the lack of gold standard data is a challenge. CRH method (Li et al., 2014b) uses an unsupervised framework to resolve the problem. Li et al. think reliable sources offer trustworthy observations which must be close to the truth. We cautiously think more trustworthy observations should be closer to the truth. Given an entry ei, D is the function to compute the distance between the truth ti and the observation value vik. Truth finding task is treated as an optimization problem. The optimization objective is to minimize the following loss function. The rik stands for the credibility of the observation provided by source Sk. We compute the credibility of the observation by using memory network based model, which is introduced in the Section 3.\nfloss = N\u2211 i=1 K\u2211 k=1 rik \u2217D(ti, vik) (1)\nThe distance functions of categorical type data and continuous data are different. When entry ei belongs to the categorical data Ucate, the distance function dcate is as following.\ndcate(ti, vik) = { 1, vik 6= ti 0, vik = ti\n(2)\nIf the observations of entry ei belong to continuous data Ucon, the distance function dcon is as following. The denominator of the function is the mean square error of value set Vi = {vi1, vi2, ..., vik, ...viK} according to the entry ei. v\u0303i stands for the mean value of the value set Vi.\ndcon(ti, vik) = |ti \u2212 vik|\u221a\n(vi1 \u2212 v\u0303i)2 + (vi2 \u2212 v\u0303i)2 + ...+ (viK \u2212 v\u0303i)2 (3)\nThe truth ti which can minimize the overall weighted absolute distance is the weighted median (Li et al., 2014b). Given the observation set {vi1, vi2, ..., vik, ...viK} with the credibility set {ri1, ri2, ..., rik, ...riK}, the weighted median of the set is vim which satisfies the following condition.\n\u2211 k:vik<vim rik < 1 2 K\u2211 k=1 rik & \u2211 k:vik>vim rik \u2264 1 2 K\u2211 k=1 rik (4)\nThe loss function in our model is as following, which is the sum of the loss functions of categorical data and continuous data respectively. Specifically, the penalty values \u03b1 and \u03b2 are learnt automatically through the model learning.\nfloss = \u03b1 \u2211\ni\u2208Ucate K\u2211 k=1 rik \u2217 dcate(ti, vik) + \u03b2 \u2211 j\u2208Ucon K\u2211 k=1 rjk \u2217 dcon(tj , vjk) (5)\nInitialization. We use voting approach to compute the initial value of categorical data,and use averaging approach for continuous data. Although, the results would be not effected on condition that the optimization is convex (Li et al., 2014b)."}, {"heading": "3 Memory Network based Model for Truth Discovery", "text": "We would like to briefly introduce the memory network. Memory network is a framework with a longterm memory as inference component (Weston et al., 2014; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Tang et al., 2016). It consists of a memorym with four components I , G, O andR. The memorym can be read and written to store the long-term information which is useful in prediction. I component learns the representation of inputs. G component generates new memories based on a new input. O component produces an output based on the new input and current memories. R component converts the output into the response format.\nIn our problem, source reliability is long-term information to be used through predicting truth. Source reliability should be updated during learning a model by inputing each sample and be combined with input to generate a new output. We use memory M = {m1,m2, ...,mK} to store the reliability of K sources and updating the memories based on the input observations and current derivative of back propagation. The inputs are the vectorized observations and response of the model are the credibility of observations. We learn the representation of the input data with memories by two types of models, feedforward neural network and feedback neural network. We call them Feedforward Memory Network (FFMN) and Feedback Memory Network (FBMN).\nPre-processing. The truth discovery data has network structure, and multiple observations of the same object have relationships. We think embedding algorithms can learn the latent law of the structure and interaction among data. We learn word embedding of data to vectorized every information from dataset. There are three kinds of data which are objects, properties and values. We use Word2Vec (Mikolov et\nal., 2013) to obtain the vector of each data. Specifically, we take a source and its observation of an entry (i.e., object, property and value) as a term of context in learning word embedding. We think the relevance between data can be learnt based on the context-based word embedding learning algorithm."}, {"heading": "3.1 Feedforward Memory Network", "text": "Feedforward neural network is like a directed acyclic graph which has no feedback through the network. Feedforward memory network is feedforward neural network with memory network mechanism. The architecture of FFMN is shown in Figure 1.

We add a memory component M into LSTM to store the reliability of sources. The memory component M plays a different role and also has a different operation by comparing with the cell C in LSTM. The input of the model is a series of values from different sources according to a same entry. The time step is the order of input values. The response of the model is the result of softmax operation of the hidden vector of last time step.

Most methods take a voting and similarity mechanism. More popular statements are more likely to be true. Similar statements have similar credibility. The statements from sources with similar reliability have similar credibility.

The basic method is using voting strategy. The web-link based methods share the similar strategy that the credibility of statements are computed based on the links between statements and sources. Corresponding methods are HUB (Kleinberg, 1999), AvgLog (Pasternack and Dan, 2010), Investment (Pasternack and Dan, 2010) and PoolInvestment (Pasternack and Dan, 2010). Specifically, Investment method takes the idea that the source \u201cinvests\u201d its reliability uniformly on its statements. The credibilities of statements are computed based on assessed reliability of sources. PoolInvestment method adds linear scaling on each entry through computing the credibility of statements. The IR based methods are inspired by the similarity computing approach in information retrieval. Given a value of the object, the credibility is computed both based on the supporting sources and against sources. Corresponding methods are Cosine (Galland et al., 2010), 2-estimates (Galland et al., 2010) and 3-estimates (Galland et al., 2010).

Specially, TruthFinder method considers similarity between statements, and AccuPr method consider that different statements on the same entry should be disjoint. LCA method is a probabilistic model which analyze latent credibility factors by using them as parameters to find the maximum a posteriori (MAP). CRH method (Li et al., 2014b) use heterogeneous types of data which consists categorical data and continuous data to estimate the reliability of sources and predict truth.

Specifically, the proposed model adopts memory mechanism to learn the reliability of sources and incorporate it into the representing of observation credibility. We utilize multiple types of data and take their different contributions in the truth discovery by assigning weights automatically in the loss function.

Conventional methods mostly research based on the mutual effect between the reliability of sources and the credibility of statements, however, pay no attention to the mutual effect among the credibility of statements about the same object. We propose memory network based models to incorporate these two ideas to do the truth discovery. We use feedforward memory network and feedback memory network to learn the representation of the credibility of statements which are about the same object. Specially, we adopt memory mechanism to learn source reliability and use it through truth prediction. During learning models, we use multiple types of data (categorical data and continuous data) by assigning different weights automatically in the loss function based on their own effect on truth discovery prediction. The experiment results show that the memory network based models much outperform the state-of-the-art method and other baseline methods.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
