CI-nets, in particular, are a CP-inspired formalism for representing ordinal preferences over sets of goods, which are typically required to be monotonic.\nConsidering also that goods often come in multi-sets rather than sets, a natural question is whether CI-nets can be used more or less directly to encode preferences over multi-sets.

Our framework nevertheless allows for encoding preferences over multi-sets with unbounded multiplicities. We also show the extent to which it can be used to represent preferences where multiplicites of the goods are not stated explicitly (\u201cpurely qualitative preferences\u201d) as well as a potential use of our generalization of CI-nets as a component of a recent system for evidence aggregation.\n1. Introduction\nCI-nets [3] are part of several languages for specifying and reasoning about preferences that are inspired by CP-nets [2, 10] (e.g. [16, 4, 5, 6, 17, 14]). These languages have in common that assertions regarding preferences are interpreted via the \u201cceteris-paribus\u201d or \u201call things equal\u201d semantics. I.e. \u201cA is preferred to B\u201d is interpreted as a shorthand for \u201cA is preferred to B, ceteris paribus\u201d. This allows the formulation of an \u201coperational semantics\u201d in terms of \u201cworsening flips\u201d for verifying statements regarding preferences computationally. CI-nets distinguishing feature is that they are a framework tailored particularly for specifying and reasoning about ordinal preferences over sets of goods. These are also typically monotonic, i.e. more goods are usually preferred to less goods (of the same type). Also taking in account the fact that more often than not goods come in multi-sets rather than sets, a natural question is whether CI-nets can be easily generalised to specify and reason about preferences over multi-sets as well as sets of goods. We here take up this challenge, providing some initial ideas on how to build a framework for the multi-set scenario on top of CI-nets in the sense that at least a restricted form of reasoning on our framework, which we call confined reasoning, can be efficiently reduced to reasoning on CI-nets.\nThe framework we propose is based on CI-nets, but can deal with what we identify as the two main differences of preferences over multi-sets and preferences over sets of goods. The first of the differences is obviously that, while preferences over sets involve comparing different\n\u2217Supported by the Austrian Science Fund FWF project W1255-N23.\ncombinations of a fixed number of elements (namely one of each item), when considering multiset preferences also the multiplicity of the items needs to be taken in account. So, for example, while in the set scenario preferring apples over oranges always is interpreted as \u201cirrespective of the number of apples and oranges\u201d, in the multi-set scenario it is possible to say, for example, that one prefers having an apple over an orange if one doesn\u2019t already have any apples, but one prefers having an orange over some number (say, up up to three) apples if one already has some (e.g. two or more) apples. A slightly more subtle issue is that, while when talking about preferences over sets there is a natural limit to the number of items one is considering (namely, one of each), in the case of preferences over multi-sets it is often the case that it is artificial to impose any a-priori upper bound on the multiplicity of the items. For example, when one says that one prefers having an apple and an orange over say even up to three pears, this also means that one prefers having two apples and two oranges over three pears, three apples and one orange over three pears, etc. If one is using the preferences as a guide as to what choice to take regarding some outcome, e.g. choosing between different baskets of fruits, then the upper bound of apples, oranges, and pears is given by the \u201cevaluation context\u201d (in this case, the upper bound of the fruits in the baskets that are available), but is not part of the preference relation per se. I.e., the same preference relation should be of use when considering a different \u201cevaluation context\u201d, e.g. a different set of fruit baskets. Now, often when talking about preferences over multi-sets the multiplicities of items are not stated explicitely, e.g. one says that one prefers apples over oranges, which often may either mean that one prefers an apple over any (relevant) number of oranges, or that one prefers any number of apples over a comparable number of oranges. In the same manner, one can say that one prefers oranges over apples if one already has enough apples. We call such preferences purely qualitative. Although in the framework we propose here multiplicities of items are considered explicitely, we also show that certain basic forms of purely qualitative preferences can be encoded in it in a straightforward manner. To further motivate our generalization of CI-nets in this work we also give an example of its use in the context of an argument-based system for the aggregation of evidence stemming from clinical trials [8, 9]. Specifically, we show how it can be applied to order the available evidence, which is then subject to further critical analysis by the system, based on personalized criteria.\nAs to the structure of this paper, we start of by giving the relevant background on CI-nets in Section 2. In Section 3 we then present our framework which, following the practice of Santhanam et al. (2013) (who present a variant of CI-nets for representing preferences among sets of countermeasures), we call C\u21350 I-nets (the \u21350 standing for the fact that our generalisation of CI-nets is designed for stating preferences over multi-sets with unbounded multiplicities). We here also discuss how to encode certain forms of purely qualitative preferences over multi-sets via C\u21350 I-nets and characterise reasoning about C\u21350 I-nets in terms of the above mentioned confined reasoning.\nIn Section 4 we present a generalisation of CI-nets for encoding preferences over multi-sets with bounded multiplicities, which forms the basis of the reduction of confined reasoning for C\u21350 Inets to reasoning on CI-nets that we also develop in this section. In Section 5 we show how C\u21350 Inets can be applied as a component of the before-mentioned system for evidence aggregation. Section 6 presents our conclusions and future work.\n2. Background: CI-nets.\nWe begin by presenting CI-nets. Throughout this work we consider O to be a fixed finite set of objects, items or goods. CI-nets consist in a set of CI-statements.\nDefinition 1 (CI-statement). A conditional importance statement (CI-statement) on O is an expression of the form\nS+, S\u2212 : S1 \u22b2 S2\nwhere S+, S\u2212, S1, S2 are pairwise disjoint subsets of O, while S1, S2 are non-empty.\nThe informal interpretation of a CI-statement S+, S\u2212 : S1 \u22b2 S2 is: \u201cif I have all the items in S + and none of those in S\u2212 , I prefer obtaining all items in S1 to obtaining all those in S2 , ceteris paribus\u201d. S+ and S\u2212 are called the positive precondition and the negative precondition respectively. S1 and S2 are called the compared sets. As stated before, a CI-net on O is then a set N of CI statements on O.\nA (strict) preference relation is a strict partial order (an irreflexive, asymmetric and transitive binary relation) over 2O. A preference relation is monotonic if Sa \u2283 Sb entails Sa > Sb for any Sa, Sb \u2208 2 O. The formal semantics of CI statements are, as to be expected, given in terms of monotonic preference relations over 2O.\nDefinition 2 (Semantics of CI-statements). A preference relation over 2O satisfies a CI-statement S+, S\u2212 : S1 \u22b2 S2 if for every S \u2032 \u2286 (O \\ (S+ \u222a S\u2212 \u222a S1 \u222a S2)), we have (S \u2032 \u222a S+ \u222a S1) > (S \u2032 \u222a S+ \u222a S2).\nA preference relation over 2O then satisfies a CI-net N if it satisfies each CI-statement in N and is monotonic. A CI-net N is satisfiable if there exists a preference relation satisfying N . Although there may be several preference relations satisfying a CI-net N , following Bouveret et al. we are mainly interested, in the so called \u201cinduced preference relation\u201d, which we denote >N . If N is satisfiable, this is the smallest preference relation satisfying N .\nExample 1. The following is an example of a CI-net from [3].\n{a},\u2205 : {d} \u22b2 {bc}; (1)\n{a}, {d} : {b} \u22b2 {c}; (2)\n{d},\u2205 : {b} \u22b2 {c} (3)\nSee Figure 1 for a graphical representation of the preference relation induced by the CI-net from Example 1.\nAn alternative, but equivalent (see [3]), way of interpreting CI-statements is in terms of worsening flips, similar to flipping sequences in CP-nets [2]. The idea behind this operational semantics is that in order to decide whether Sa >N Sb (Sa \u201cdominates\u201d Sb) for Sa, Sb \u2286 O, one needs to find a sequence of worsening flips Sa = S1, . . . , Sn = Sb where each worsening flip Si \u2740 Si+1 (1 \u2264 i < n) corresponds to Si >N Si+1 being sanctioned either (i) because Si \u2283 Si+1 (\u2283 flip), or (ii) by a CI-statement in N (CI flip). Transitivity of the preference relation then allows us to conclude that Sa >N Sb. In particular, a CI-net N is satisfiable if and only if it does not possess any cycle of worsening flips.\nDefinition 3 (Worsening flips for CI-nets). Let N be a CI-net on the set of objects O, and let Sa , Sb \u2286 O. Then Sa \u2740 Sb is called a worsening flip wrt. N if one of the following two conditions is satisfied:\n\u2022 Sa \u2283 Sb (\u2283 flip) \u2022 there is a CI-statement S+, S\u2212 : S1 \u22b2 S2 \u2208 N and S\n\u2032 \u2286 (O \\ (S+ \u222a S\u2212 \u222a S1 \u222a S2)) s.t. Sa = (S\u2032 \u222a S+ \u222a S1) and Sb = (S \u2032 \u222a S+ \u222a S2) (CI flip).\nAn equivalent but more clearly operational characterisation of the latter condition is that if S = (O \\ (S+ \u222a S\u2212 \u222a S1 \u222a S2)), then:\n\u2022 (S1 \u222a S +) \u2286 Sa , (S2 \u222a S +) \u2286 Sb ; \u2022 (Sa \u2229 S\u2212) = (Sb \u2229 S\n\u2212) = (Sa \u2229 S2) = (Sb \u2229 S1) = \u2205; \u2022 and (S \u2229 Sa) = (S \u2229 Sb).\nWe denote the fact there exists a sequence of worsening flips from Sa to Sb w.r.t. N as Sa \u2192\u0592N Sb. We will also often say that a flip is w.r.t. the CI-statement that \u201cjustifies\u201d it. Then a sequence of flips is w.r.t. a a certain set of CI-statements when the flips in the sequence are w.r.t. the CI-statements in the set.\nDominance in satisfiable CI-nets is PSPACE-complete, even if every CI-statement bears on singletons and has no negative preconditions, every CI-statement bears on singletons and has no positive preconditions or, finally, every CI-statement is precondition-free. Satisfiability of CI-nets is also PSPACE-complete. Dominance and satisfiability in precondition-free singletons (so called, \u201cSCI-nets\u201d) is in P.\nBouveret et al. also identify coNP-complete as well as polynomial sufficient conditions to determine whether any CI-net is satisfiable. For instance, for the polynomial sufficient condition, let the preference graph G(N ) corresponding to a CI-net N , be defined as the graph whose directed edges are the pairs (o1, o2) such that there is a CI-statement S\n+, S\u2212 : S1 \u22b2 S2 \u2208 N with o1 \u2208 S1 and o2 \u2208 S2. Then, any CI-net with an acyclic preference graph is satisfiable.\n3. C\u21350 I-nets\nIn this Section we present C\u21350 I-nets. First, we give their definition and extensional semantics, then we consider to what extent purely qualitative assertions regarding multi-set preferences can be encoded via C\u21350 I-nets. Finally, we present the operational semantics and, in this context, confined reasoning for C\u21350 I-nets.\n3.0.1 Definition & extensional semantics\nWe continue to consider a fixed set O of objects and identify a multi-set M on O via its multiplicity function mM. The latter associates to each o \u2208 O the number mM(o) of occurrences or instances of o that are in M. We will often represent a multi-set M in the form {(o,mM(o)) | o \u2208 O,mM(o) \u2265 1}. We will also use standard terminology and notation for sets to be interpreted as the corresponding notion for multi-sets. MO denotes all finite multisets defined on O.\nC\u21350 I-nets consist of a set of C\u21350 I-statements which, similarily to CI-statements involve a \u201cprecondition\u201d and a \u201ccomparison expression\u201d. Preconditions of C\u21350 I-statements consist of what we call a sequence of simple constraints, i.e. expressions of the form\no1R1a1, . . . , onRnan\nwhere oi \u2208 O, Ri \u2208 {\u2265,\u2264,=}, the ai are integers \u2265 0. We say that a precondition is defined on the objects oi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) and that a multi-set M \u2032 \u2208 MO satisfies the precondition,\nM\u2032 |= o1R1a1, . . . , onRnan,\niff\nmM\u2032(oi)Riai for every 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nA precondition P+ is satisfiable if there is some M\u2032 \u2208 MO s.t. M \u2032 |= P+. A precondition consisting of an empty sequence of constraints is satisfiable by any multiset by definition.\nComparison expressions of C\u21350 I-statements involve update patterns. These are expressions of the form\no1 ++a1, . . . , on ++an\nwith each oi \u2208 O appearing at most once, the ai \u2265 1. Just as for the preconditions of C \u21350 Istatements, we say that an update pattern is defined on the objects oi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n). Now we define the update of a multiset M\u2032 \u2208 MO w.r.t. an update pattern as\nM\u2032[o1 ++a1, . . . , on ++an] := M \u2032\u2032\nwhere mM\u2032\u2032(o) = mM\u2032(o) for o \u2208 O but o 6= oi for every 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and mM\u2032\u2032(oi) = mM\u2032(oi) + ai for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nDefinition 4 (C\u21350 I-statement). A C\u21350 I-statement w.r.t. a set of objects O is an expression of the form\nP+ : P1 \u22b2 P2\nwhere P+ is a possibly empty sequence of constraints on O and P1, P2 are update patterns defined on non-empty, disjoint subsets of the objects O. The C\u21350 I-statement is satisfiable if the precondition P+ is satisfiable.\nIf P+ is an empty sequence we write P1 \u22b2 P2. We will also often use the shorthand {o1, . . . , on}Ta for any sequence o1Ta, . . . , onTa with T \u2208 {\u2265,\u2264,=,++}. The intuitive meaning of a C \u21350 Istatement P+ : P1 \u22b2 P2 with\nP+ = {o+i R + i a + i }1\u2264i\u2264n+ ,\nP1 = {o 1 j ++a 1 j }1\u2264j\u2264n1 , P2 = {o 2 k ++a 2 k}1\u2264k\u2264n2\nis: \u201cif I have R+i ai of oi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n+), I prefer having a 1 j more of o 1 j (1 \u2264 j \u2264 n1), than having a2k more of o 2 k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n2), ceteris paribus\u201d. The formal semantics of C\n\u21350 I-statements are, analogously to CI-statements, defined over preference (binary irreflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive) relations > over MO.\nDefinition 5 (Semantics of C\u21350 I-statements). A preference relation > over MO satisfies a C \u21350 I statement P+ : P1 \u22b2 P2 if for every M \u2032 \u2208 MO s.t. M \u2032 |= P+, we have M\u2032[P1] > M \u2032[P2]\nAlternatively, by abuse of notation we define P+ := {M\u2032 \u2208 MO | M \u2032 |= P+} and for an update pattern P = {oi ++ai}1\u2264i\u2264n, MP := {(oi, ai) | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n}. Then > satisfies the C \u21350 I-statement P+ : P1 \u22b2 P2 if for every M \u2032 \u2208 P+, we have (M\u2032 \u222a MP1) > (M \u2032 \u222a MP2). Note that if P + is unsatisfiable, then the C\u21350 I-statement P+ : P1 \u22b2 P2 is trivially satisfied by any preference relation over MO. Now, a C\u21350 I-net on the set of objects O is, as already indicated, a set N of C\u21350 I-statements on O. A preference relation > over MO satisfies a C \u21350 I-net N if > satisfies each C\u21350 I statement in N and > is monotonic (on MO). Finally, a C \u21350 I-net N is satisfiable if there exists a preference relation > satisfying N . Just as for CI-nets we are mainly interested in the smallest preference relation induced by a satisfiable C\u21350 I net N , which we also denote >N . The latter relation exists since the intersection of preference relations satisfying N also satisfies N .\nExample 2. Let N be the C\u21350 I-net\na++1 \u22b2 {b, c, d}++6; (4)\na \u2265 1 : b++1 \u22b2 {c, d}++3; (5)\na \u2265 3, b \u2264 2 : c++3 \u22b2 d++3 (6)\nWe will later be able to show that N is satisfiable (see Example 7). From this specification it follows that, e.g.\n{(a, 3), (b3)} >N {(a, 3), (b, 2), (d, 5)}.\nA proof of this is shown in Example 3, after having introduced the operational semantics for C\u21350 I-nets.\nGiven the size of MO, we cannot even hope to give a graphical representation of the induced preference relation of the C\u21350 I-net in Example 2 analogous to that of the induced preference relation of the CI-net in Example 1 (Figure 1). As hinted at in the introduction to this work, we will nevertheless later on define a form of restricted reasoning on C\u21350 I nets for which a graphical representation is at least in theory possible (note that in practice even graphical representations of most CI-nets will be too large to be of much use).\nProposition 5 in [3] states that all monotonic preferences over 2O can be captured via CInets. The proof of this proposition can be easily adapted to show that all motonic preferences over MO can be captured via C\n\u21350 I-nets. In effect, consider a preference relation > over MO and Ma,Mb \u2208 MO s.t. Ma > Mb but Ma 6\u2283 Mb. Then there must be some disjoint and nonempty O1,O2 \u2286 O s.t. mMa(o) > mMb(o) for o \u2208 O1, mMb(o) > mMa(o) for o \u2208 O2, while mMa(o) = mMb(o) for o \u2208 (O \\ (O1 \u222aO2)) Now the C \u21350 I-statement P+ : P1 \u22b2 P2 with\nP+ := {o = mMa\u2229Mb(o)}o\u2208O,\nP1 := {o++(mMa(o)\u2212mMb(o))}o\u2208O1, P2 := {o++(mMb(o)\u2212mMa(o))}o\u2208O2\nclearly \u201cinduces\u201d precisely Ma > Mb. Hence the preference relation induced by the C \u21350 I-net that consists of the C\u21350 I-statements obtained in this manner for each such Ma,Mb clearly captures >. The obvious problem with this argument is that, such as the CI-net in the proof of Proposition 5 in [3] can have an exponential number of CI-statements, the C\u21350 I-net constructed in the way we have just detailed can have a potentially infinite number of C\u21350 I-statements1. We leave it as an open question whether there is any useful alternative characterisation of the kinds of preference relations that can be captured efficiently (hence, also finitely) by C\u21350 I (and, for that manner, CI) nets. In the rest of this work we nevertheless asume the C\u21350 I-nets we are dealing with have a finite number of C\u21350 I-statements.\n3.0.2 Purely qualitative preferences\nWe now briefly consider how purely qualitative preferences as described in the introduction can be encoded using C\u21350 I nets. More to the point, we consider this issue under the assumption that purely qualitative preferences can be interpreted in precise terms, i.e. that they are shorthands for preferences where multiplicites of items are explicitely referred to.\nConsider first purely qualitative \u201ccomparison expressions\u201d, for example, an assertion of the form \u201cI prefer apples over oranges\u201d. If this is interpreted as an assertion regarding multi-sets rather than sets of fruits, one possible interpretation of this assertion is \u201cI prefer an apple over an orange\u201d. This can clearly be encoded easily using the C\u21350 I-statement\na++1 \u22b2 o++1\nOther similar interpretations such as \u201cI prefer an apple over a relevant/reasonable number of oranges\u201d or \u201cI prefer a sufficient number of apples over a relevant/reasonable number of oranges\u201d can be encoded in a similar manner. \u201cI prefer an apple over an orange\u201d could also mean \u201cI prefer a sufficent number R (e.g. R = 1) of apples over any number of oranges\u201d. Although C\u21350 Inets don\u2019t have any means of expressing \u201cany\u201d, we can introduce the special symbol ## to be interpreted as the maximum number of each object given in a specific context (this will become clearer later on). We also use just o## as a shorthand for o++##. Then, the following encoding would do:\na++R \u22b2 o##.\nAnother possible interpretation of \u201cI prefer apples over oranges\u201d is \u201cI prefer comparable numbers of apples to oranges\u201d. This assertion can only be encoded as a set of C\u21350 I-statements:\n{a++X \u22b2 o++X | X \u2265 1}.\nTo avoid an infinite number of C\u21350 I-statements, the following alternative encoding will do for most practical scenarios\n{a++X \u22b2 o++X | 1 \u2264 X \u2264 ##}.\nAll of the above representations of \u201cI prefer apples over oranges\u201d can be easily generalised to statements such as \u201cI prefer pineapples and mangos to apples and oranges\u201d. Nevertheless, we note that the generalisation of the last reading we considered would require exponentially many C\u21350 I-statements, e.g.\n{p++X,m++Y \u22b2 a++V, o++W |\n1 \u2264 X,Y,V,W \u2264 ##,X+Y = V +W}\n1This, despite the fact that, just as CI-statements can induce up to an exponential number of what we call \u201cCI flips\u201d later on, C\u21350 I-statements have the power to express a potentially infinite number of CI flips.\nsays that \u201cI prefer pineapples and mangos to the same number of apples and oranges\u201d.\nConsider now the preconditions of assertions regarding preferences, i.e. the \u201cif X\u201d part of an assertion of the form \u201cif X, I prefer Y over Z\u201d. Some common pre-conditions can be easily encoded using C\u21350 I-statements. E.g. \u201cif I have a certain number R of apples\u201d or, similarly, \u201cif I have enough (i.e. at least R) apples\u201d can clearly be encoded as a = R, a \u2265 R respectively. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have any apples\u201d and \u201cif I don\u2019t have enough (i.e. less than R) apples\u201d can be encoded as a = 0 and a \u2264 R\u2212 1 respectively. Any combination of such assertions can also be efficiently encoded using preconditions of C\u21350 I-statements. Slighly more complicated are assertions of the form \u201cif I have more apples than oranges\u201d. Here, again, several CI-statements are necessary:\n{a \u2265 X, o \u2264 X\u2212 1 : . . . | 1 \u2264 X \u2264 ##}.\nClearly, combinations of such more complicated assertions, e.g. \u201cif I have more apples than oranges and more pineapples than mangos\u201d, require an exponential number of C\u21350 I-statements. The fact that, in order to encode some purely qualitative assertions regarding preferences, (possibly exponentially many) sets of C\u21350 I-statements are needed stems from the fact that, as will become clearer in Section 4, C\u21350 I statements are ultimately based on CI statements. In particular, they inherit the \u201catomic\u201d nature of CI statements. Consider, for example, that one has disjoint subsets S, S\u2032 \u2286 O and one wants to express the fact that any one element from S is preferred to any one element of S\u2032. This can only be written as the set of CI-statements\n{o \u22b2 o\u2032 | o \u2208 S, o\u2032 \u2208 S\u2032}.\nAn assertion with a precondition stating \u201cif I have any elements from S and I don\u2019t have some elements from S\u2032\u201d requires exponentially many CI statements:\n{T, T\u2032 : . . . | \u2205 \u2282 T \u2286 S,\u2205 \u2282 T\u2032 \u2286 S\u2032}.\n3.0.3 Operational semantics & confined reasoning\nWe turn to giving an operational semantics for C\u21350 I-nets analogous to that presented in Section 2 for CI-nets, i.e. in terms of \u201cworsening flips\u201d. This will also be the basis of our definition of confined reasoning for C\u21350 I-nets.\nDefinition 6 (Worsening flips for C\u21350 I-nets). Let N be a C\u21350 I-net on O and Ma,Mb \u2208 MO. Then Ma \u2740 Mb is called a worsening flip w.r.t. N if one of the two following conditions is satisfied:\n\u2022 Ma \u2283 Mb (\u2283 flip) \u2022 There is a C\u21350 I statement P+ : P1 \u22b2 P2 \u2208 N and an M \u2032 \u2208 MO s.t. M \u2032 |= P+, Ma = M\u2032[P1],\nand Mb = M \u2032[P2] (CI flip). Alternatively, Ma = M\u2032 \u222a MPC1 , Mb = M \u2032 \u222a MPC2 for some M\u2032 \u2208 P+ or, operationally:\n\u2013 MP1 \u2286 Ma, \u2013 MP2 \u2286 Mb, \u2013 (Ma \\ MP1) = (Mb \\ MP2), and \u2013 if M\u2032 = (Ma \\ MP1) = (Mb \\ MP2), then M \u2032 \u2208 P+ (i.e. M\u2032 |= P+).\nAgain, we denote that there exists a sequence of worsening flips from Ma to Mb w.r.t. the C \u21350 I-net N as Ma \u2192\u0592N Mb. The following proposition can be proven in analogous fashion to the proof of Theorems 7 and 8 in [2].\nProposition 1. Let N be a satisfiable C\u21350 I-net defined on O, and Ma,Mb \u2208 MO. We have Ma >N Mb iff Ma \u2192\u0592N Mb.\nExample 3. Consider again the C\u21350 I-net N from Example 2. The following is a sequence of flips from which\n{(a, 3), (b3)} >N {(a, 3), (b, 2), (d, 5)}\ncan be derived:\n{(a, 3), (b3)}\n\u2740 (CI, 5)\n{(a, 3), (b, 2), (c, 3), (d, 3)}\n\u2740 (CI, 6)\n{(a, 3), (b, 2), (d, 6)}\n\u2740 (\u2283)\n{(a, 3), (b, 2), (d, 5)}\nThe labels of the flips indicate the type of flip and, in case of a CI flip, the C\u21350 I-statement that justifies the flip.\nFrom a computational perspective, a major difference between CI-nets and C\u21350 I-nets on O is that while for the former, sequences of worsening flips without loops can be of length up to 2O (given that there are up to this number of distinct subsets of O), in the latter sequences without loops of arbitrary length are possible. Nevertheless, if a sequence of worsening flips from any one multiset Ma to any other multiset Mb exists then it will, by definition, be of finite length. Stated otherwise, such a sequence will contain only finitely many subsets of MO and, hence, can be said to be confined to any subset M of MO for which it holds that each multiset M\n\u2032 in the sequence is s.t. M\u2032 \u2286 M.\nDefinition 7 (Confinement of sequences of worsening flips). Let M \u2208 MO. We say that a sequence of worsening flips Ma = M1 . . .Mn = Mb w.r.t. a C\n\u21350 I-net N is confined to M if each flip Mi \u2740 Mi+1 (for 1 \u2264 i < n) in the sequence is s.t. Mi,Mi+1 \u2286 M. We denote Ma \u2192\u0592N ,M Mb if there is a a sequence of worsening flips from Ma to Mb confined to M. Finally, we say that N is c-consistent w.r.t M if there is no Ma \u2286 M s.t. Ma \u2192\u0592N ,M Ma.\nWe can say that \u2192\u0592N ,M defines a form of confined reasoning on N w.r.t. a M \u2208 MO. Proposition 2, Corollary 1, and Corollary 2 are straightforward consequences of Definitions 6 and 7 as well as Proposition 1. They give a characterisation of reasoning about C\u21350 I-nets in terms of confined reasoning.\nProposition 2. Ma \u2192\u0592N Mb iff Ma \u2192\u0592N ,M Mb for some M \u2208 MO\nCorollary 1. If N is satisfiable, then Ma >N Mb iff Ma \u2192\u0592N ,M Mb for some M \u2208 MO.\nCorollary 2. N is satisfiable iff N is c-consistent w.r.t every M \u2208 MO.\nNow usually one will only be interested in determining whether Ma >N Mb holds for some (Ma,Mb) \u2208 U where U is a finite subset of MO \u00d7MO (in particular, |U| = 1). Such a U is what we called an \u201cevaluation context\u201d in the introduction. Hence one would ideally also like to know some (small) M \u2208 MO s.t. \u2192\u0592N ,M captures \u2192\u0592N for U, i.e. Ma \u2192\u0592N Mb iff Ma \u2192\u0592N ,M Mb for every (Ma,Mb) \u2208 U.\nExample 4. Consider again the C\u21350 I-net N from Example 2. This C\u21350 I-net has the property that the dependencies between objects as given by the comparison expressions are \u201cacyclic\u201d. We don\u2019t develop this notion formally here, but it can be easily generalised from the notion of a CI-net having an acyclic dependency graph as defined in Section 2. This means that given an initial multi-set Ma, lets say Ma = {(a, 3), (b, 3)}, one can compute an upper bound on the number of instances of each object one will be able to add to the objects in Ma via worsening flips. Let #o denote this number for each o \u2208 O. Then\n#a = 3,\n#b = 3+ (#a \u2217 6) = 21,\n#c = (#a \u2217 6) + (#b \u2217 3) = 81,\n#d = (#a \u2217 6) + (#b \u2217 3) + (#c \u2217 3) = 324\nand therefore \u2192\u0592N ,M, with M = {(a, 3), (b, 21), (c, 81), (d, 324)}, captures \u2192\u0592N for U = {(Ma,M \u2032) | M\u2032 \u2208 MO}.\n3.0.4 CI-nets as a special case of C\u21350 I-nets\nWe are now also in position to see in what sense CI-nets are a special case of C\u21350 I-nets. Translated into the context of C\u21350 I-nets a CI-statement c = S+, S\u2212 : S1 \u22b2 S2 can be written as the C \u21350 Istatement c\u0302 := P+ : C where\nP+ := P+1 \u222a P + 2 \u222a P + 3 , P+1 := {s + = 1 | s+ \u2208 S+}, P+2 := {s = 0 | s \u2212 \u2208 (S\u2212 \u222a S1 \u222a S2)}, P+3 := {s \u2264 1 | s \u2208 (O \\ (S + \u222a S\u2212 \u222a S1 \u222a S2))},\nand\nC := {s1 ++1 | s1 \u2208 S1} \u22b2 {s2 ++1 | s2 \u2208 S2}.\nIf, given a CI-net N , one constructs a C\u21350 I-net N\u0302 := {c\u0302 | c \u2208 N} it is relatively easy to see that the CI-flips w.r.t. N and N\u0302 are, by construction, exactly the same. Hence one also has that \u2192\u0592 N\u0302 ,O captures \u2192\u0592\nN\u0302 for U = (O\u00d7O).\nExample 5. The CI-net from Example 1 as a C\u21350 I-net (assuming for simplicity thatO = {a, b, c, d}) is the following:\na = 1, {b, c, d} = 0 : d++1 \u22b2 b++1, c++1;\na = 1, {b, c, d} = 0 : b++1 \u22b2 c++1;\na \u2264 1, {b, c} = 0, d = 1 : b++1 \u22b2 c++1.\n4. Confined reasoning about C\u21350 I-nets\nIn this Section we develop the fundamentals for computational procedures for confined reasoning for C\u21350 I-nets and thus, via corollaries 1 and 2, also for non-confined reasoning about C\u21350 I-nets. More concretely, assume one has a C\u21350 I net N , an \u201cevaluation context\u201d U \u2286 (MO \u00d7MO), as\nwell as some M \u2208 MO s.t. \u2192\u0592N ,M captures \u2192\u0592N for U. Alternatively, one is just interested in \u2192\u0592N ,M without knowing for certain whether \u2192\u0592N ,M captures \u2192\u0592N for U. E.g. one has some heuristic for determining an M \u2208 MO s.t. \u2192\u0592N ,M captures \u2192\u0592N for U or one could compute M in an iterative fashion. The results in this Section then provide a basis for sound (and depending on whether \u2192\u0592N ,M captures \u2192\u0592N for U, also complete) procedures for determining \u2192\u0592N for U.\nSpecifically, in this Section we first introduce a generalisation of CI-nets for specifying and reasoning about preferences over multi-sets where the multiplicites of the items are bounded by some number. We call these Cm I-nets. We then show how to translate confined reasoning about C\u21350 I-nets to reasoning about Cm I-nets. We also finally give an efficient reduction of reasoning for Cm I-nets to reasoning about CI-nets.\n4.1. Cm I-nets\nCm I-nets consist of, as to be expected by now, a set of Cm I-statements. These are defined in a manner that follows closely the definition of CI-statements.\nDefinition 8 (Cm I-statements). LetO be a finite set and M a finite multiset onO. A Cm I statement on M is an expression of the form\nM+,M\u2212 : M1 \u22b2 M2\nwhere M+ \u2286 M, M\u2212 \u2286 (M \\ M+), M1,M2 \u2286 (M \\ (M + \u222a M\u2212)), M1 6= \u2205, M2 6= \u2205, and (M1 \u2229 M2) = \u2205.\nThe constraints on M+,M\u2212,M1,M2 in Definition 8 amount to M +,M\u2212,M1,M2 being disjoint sets when M is a set. Hence the definition in this case amounts to Definition 1. The semantics of Cm I-statements also is a direct generalisation of that of CI-statements, although now defined for preference relations over 2M.\nDefinition 9 (Semantics of Cm I-statements). A preference relation over 2M satisfies a Cm I-statement M+,M\u2212 : M1 \u22b2 M2 if for every M \u2032 \u2286 (M \\ (M+ \u222a M\u2212 \u222aM1 \u222aM2)), we have (M \u2032 \u222aM+ \u222aM1) > (M\u2032 \u222a M+ \u222a M2).\nNote that M+ \u2286 M, M\u2212 \u2286 (M \\ M+), M1,M2 \u2286 (M \\ (M + \u222a M\u2212)), and (M1 \u2229 M2) = \u2205 imply that (M+ \u222a M\u2212 \u222a M1 \u222a M2) \u2286 M and, hence, M \u2032 in Definition 9 is well defined.\nNow the notions of a Cm I-net, a preference relation satisfying a Cm I-net, a Cm I-net being satisfiable, as well as the induced preference relation for a Cm I-net (which for a Cm I-net N we again denote >N ), are defined analogously as for CI and C \u21350 I nets. Together with the already referred to identity of Definition 8 and Definition 1 when M is a set, this means, in particular, that Cm I-nets are indeed a generalisation of CI-nets. It is also easy to show that a Cm I-net on M can express all monotonic preference relations on 2M. Example 6 shows the result of encoding confined reasoning on the C\u21350 I-net of Example 2 w.r.t. M = {(A, 6), (B, 6), (C, 6)} as a Cm I-net on M. We develop the details of this encoding in the following sub-section.\nThe operational semantics for Cm I-nets is also defined in analogous fashion as for CI and\nC\u21350 I nets, via the notion of a worsening flip (for Cm I-nets).\nDefinition 10 (Worsening flips for Cm I-nets). Let N be a Cm I-net on M and let Ma,Mb \u2286 M. Then Ma \u2740 Mb is called a worsening flip w.r.t. N if one of the two following conditions is satisfied:\n\u2022 Ma \u2283 Mb (\u2283 flip)\n\u2022 There is a Cm I-statement M+,M\u2212 : M1 \u22b2 M2 \u2208 N and an M \u2032 \u2286 (M \\ (M+ \u222a M\u2212 \u222a M1 \u222a\nM2)) s.t. Ma = (M \u2032 \u222a M+ \u222a M1) and Mb = (M \u2032 \u222a M+ \u222a M2) (CI flip).\nA more operational characterisation equivalent to the latter condition is that if M = (M \\ (M+ \u222a M\u2212 \u222a M1 \u222a M2)), then\n\u2022 (M \\ (M\u2212 \u222a M2)) \u2287 Ma \u2287 (M1 \u222a M +), \u2022 (M \\ (M\u2212 \u222a M1)) \u2287 Mb \u2287 (M2 \u222a M +), and \u2022 (M \u2229 Ma) = (M \u2229 Mb).\nWe again denote there existing a sequence of worsening flips from Ma to Mb w.r.t. N as Ma \u2192\u0592N Mb. Proposition 3. Let N be a satisfiable Cm I-net on M, and Ma,Mb \u2286 M. We have Ma >N Mb if and only if Ma \u2192\u0592N Mb.\n4.2. Translating confined reasoning about C\u21350 I-nets to reasoning about Cm I-nets\nLet N be a C\u21350 I net, M \u2208 MO. We will in the following reduce confined reasoning w.r.t. N and a M \u2208 MO to reasoning about a C\nm I-net on M. Our reduction will be in two steps. First we translate the C\u21350 I-net N into a C\u21350 I-net N \u2032 s.t. the CI flips Ma \u2740 Mb w.r.t. N \u2032 are exactly those CI flips Ma \u2740 Mb w.r.t. N s.t. Ma,Mb \u2286 M. We will say that we are \u201creinterpreting\u201d N w.r.t. M. In a second step it will then be easy to convert the C\u21350 I-net N \u2032 into a Cm I-net NM s.t. Ma \u2192\u0592N \u2032,M Mb iff Ma \u2192\u0592NM Mb. We will be informal in this section, since the translation is quite straightforward.\nThe basis of reinterpreting a C\u21350 I-net N w.r.t. M is to rewrite each C\u21350 I statement c = P+ :\nP1 \u22b2 P2 in N into a C \u21350 I statement c\u2032 = P+ \u2032 : P1 \u22b2 P2 s.t. M \u2032 \u2208 P+ \u2032 iff M\u2032 \u2208 P+, (M\u2032 \u222aMP1) \u2286 M, and (M\u2032 \u222a MP2) \u2286 M. We will say that c is meaningful w.r.t. M if such a M \u2032 exists and call any such M\u2032 a multi-set that makes c meaningful w.r.t. M. Also, we will call such a C\u21350 I statement c\u2032 equivalent to c for M. So assume we have a C\u21350 I statement c = P+ : P1 \u22b2 P2 that is meaningful w.r.t. M. Then, since c is also satisfiable note that the precondition and comparison expressions can be written in the form\nP+ = {o+i \u2265 a + i }1\u2264i\u2264p \u222a {o \u2212 j \u2264 a \u2212 j }1\u2264j\u2264q,\nP1 = {o 1 k ++a 1 k}1\u2264k\u2264r, P2 = {o 2 l ++a 2 l }1\u2264l\u2264s\nwhere each o \u2208 O appears at most once in a sub-expression of the form o+i \u2265 a + i and at most once in a sub-expression of the form o\u2212j \u2264 a \u2212 j in the precondition.\nLet O\u2217 be defined as the set\n{o+i }1\u2264i\u2264p \u222a {o \u2212 j }1\u2264j\u2264q \u222a {o 1 k}1\u2264k\u2264r \u222a {o 2 l }1\u2264l\u2264s\nWe re-label the objects in O\u2217 \u2286 O to {o1, . . . , om} (m = p+ q + r + s). We can now rewrite the precondition and comparison expressions of c as (we abuse the notation by using the same names as before)\nP+ = {oh \u2265 A + h }1\u2264h\u2264m,A+h >0 \u222a {oh \u2264 A \u2212 h }1\u2264h\u2264m,\nP1 = {oh ++A 1 h}1\u2264h\u2264m,A1h>0 , P2 = {oh ++A 2 h}1\u2264h\u2264m,A2h>0\nwhere for each 1 \u2264 h \u2264 m we define\n\u2022 A+h := a + i if there is a i \u2208 {1, . . . , p} s.t. oh = o + i , A + h := 0 otherwise; \u2022 A\u2212h := a \u2212 j if there is a j \u2208 {1, . . . , q} s.t. oh = o \u2212 j , A \u2212 h := mM(oh) otherwise; \u2022 A1h := a 1 k if there is a k \u2208 {1, . . . , r} s.t. oh = o 1 k , A 1 h := 0 otherwise; \u2022 A2h := a 1 l if there is a l \u2208 {1, . . . , s} s.t. oh = o 2 l , A 2 h := 0 otherwise.\nIt should be clear that this rewriting produces a C\u21350 I statement which has the same multisets which make it meaningful w.r.t. M as the original C\u21350 I-statement. We further simplify the precondition P+ to\n{oh \u2265 A + h }1\u2264h\u2264m,A+h >0 \u222a {oh \u2264 B \u2212 h }1\u2264h\u2264m\nwhere B\u2212h is defined as\nmax{I | A+h \u2264 I \u2264 A \u2212 h and I + A 1 h + A 2 h \u2264 mM(oh)}.\nIt should still be relatively straightforward to see that this rewriting produces a C\u21350 I statement c\u2032 that is equivalent to the original C\u21350 I statement c for M. As a consequence, we have that for the C\u21350 I net N \u2032 obtained from N by translating every c \u2208 N that is meaningful for M in the manner just described, it holds that Ma \u2192\u0592N \u2032,M Mb iff Ma \u2192\u0592N ,M Mb.\nNow, for the second step of our reduction of confined reasoning for C\u21350 I-nets to reasoning on Cm I-nets, consider again a C\u21350 I statement c\u2032 \u2208 N \u2032 obtained from a c \u2208 N as described above. We now define\nM+ := {(oh, A + h ) | 1 \u2264 h \u2264 m, A + h > 0}, Xoh := mM(oh)\u2212 B \u2212 h \u2212 A 1 h \u2212 A 2 h, M\u2212 := {(oh,Xoh) | 1 \u2264 h \u2264 m,Xoh > 0)},\nM1 := {(oh, A 1 h) | 1 \u2264 h \u2264 m, A 1 h > 0}, M2 := {(oh, A 2 h) | 1 \u2264 h \u2264 m, A 2 h > 0}.\nIts then relatively straightforward to see, first of all, that c\u2032\u2032 = M+,M\u2212 : M1 \u22b2 M2 is a C m I statement. Consider now the Cm I net NM consisting of such C m I statements c\u2032\u2032 for each c\u2032 \u2208 N \u2032. We have that Ma \u2740 Mb is a CI flip w.r.t. c \u2032 inN \u2032 iff it is a CI flip w.r.t. c\u2032\u2032 \u2208 NM. As a consequence, Ma \u2192\u0592N \u2032,M Mb iff Ma \u2192\u0592NM Mb; hence, also Ma \u2192\u0592N ,M Mb iff Ma \u2192\u0592NM Mb.\nExample 6. The reinterpretation of the C\u21350 I net from Example 2 w.r.t. M = {(A, 6), (B, 6), (C, 6)} is\na \u2264 5, {b, c, d} \u2264 0 : a++1 \u22b2 {b, c, d}++6;\na \u2265 1, b \u2264 5, {c, d} \u2264 3 : b++1 \u22b2 {c, d}++3;\na \u2265 3, b \u2264 2, {c, d} \u2264 3 : c++1 \u22b2 d++3.\nThe translation to a Cm I-net is then\n{(a, 1)} \u22b2 {(b, 6), (c, 6), (d, 6)};\n{(a, 1)},\u2205 : {(b, 1)} \u22b2 {(c, 3), (d, 3)};\n{(a, 3)}, {(b, 4)} : {(c, 3)} \u22b2 {(d, 3)}.\n4.3. Reduction of Cm I-nets to CI-nets\nWe now reduce preferences stated via Cm I-nets to preferences stated using CI-nets. More precisely, given a multiset M and a Cm I-net NM on M we will define a CI-net NSM for a set SM and a mapping of every M\u2032 \u2286 M to a M\u2032 \u2286 SM s.t. NM is satisfiable iff NSM is satisfiable, and assuming NM is satisfiable, Ma <NM Mb iff Ma <NSM Mb.\nWe start by introducing some notation. Given some o \u2208 O and i, j s.t. i, j \u2265 1 we define the forward-generated set of j indexed copies from i of o as\n[o]Fi,j := {oi, oi+1, . . . , oi+(j\u22121)}\nand the backward-generated set of j indexed copies from i of o as\n[o]Bi,j := {oi, oi\u22121, . . . , oi\u2212(j\u22121)}.\nIf j = 0, we define\n[o]Fi,j = [o] B i,j := \u2205.\nThen\nSM := \u22c3 {[o]F1,mM(o) | o \u2208 O}\nWe call [o]F 1,mM(o) = [o]B mM(o),mM(o) for o \u2208 O the set of indexed copies of o in SM.\nFor some M\u2032 \u2286 M, ssSM(M \u2032) includes all sets which, for each o \u2208 O, have the same number of elements from the set of indexed copies of o in SM as instances of o there are in M \u2032. Formally, we define ssSM (M \u2032) to be the set\n{S \u2286 SM | |S \u2229 [o] F 1,mM(o) | = mM\u2032(o) for every o \u2208 O}.\nClearly, in particular ssSM (M) = {SM}. We will also (partially) order the sets in SM via the order >i defined as the transitive closure of the binary relation\n{(S1, S2) | (S1 \u222a S2) \\ (S1 \u2229 S2) = {oi, oj} s.t.\no \u2208 O, oi \u2208 S1, oj \u2208 S2, and j = i+ 1}.\nCrucial for our purposes is that there is a unique maximal element\nmax>i(ssSM (M \u2032)) = \u22c3 {[o]F1,mM\u2032 (o) | o \u2208 O\u2032}\nw.r.t. >i within ssSM(M \u2032) for every M\u2032 \u2286 M2. We denote this maximal element as M\u2032. Note that in particular M = SM. Next we proceed to define for a Cm I-statement c \u2208 NM the corresponding CI statement c \u2208 NSM . Assume c is of the form M +,M\u2212 : M1 \u22b2 M2. Then\nc := M\u0302+, M\u0302\u2212 : M\u03021 \u22b2 M\u03022\n2There is also a unique minimal element \u22c3 {[o]BmM(o),mM\u2032 (o) | o \u2208 O\u2032}\nw.r.t. >i within ssSM (M \u2032) for every M\u2032 \u2286 M.\nwhere\nM\u0302+ := \u22c3 {[o]F1,m+(o) | o \u2208 O} M\u0302\u2212 := \u22c3 {[o]BmM(o),m\u2212(o) | o \u2208 O}\nM\u03021 := \u22c3 {[o]BmM(o)\u2212m\u2212(o),m1(o) | o \u2208 O} M\u03022 := \u22c3 {[o]Fm+(o)+1,m2(o) | o \u2208 O}.\nWe denote the set of CI statements corresponding to the c \u2208 NM as cs. Apart from having a statement c as defined above for each c \u2208 NM, NSM also contains the set of CI-statements\ncsi := {oi \u22b2 oj | o \u2208 O, 1 \u2264 i < mM(o), j = i+ 1}\nNow Corollaries 3 and 4 basically follows from Proposition 4 which, in turn, follows mainly from lemmas 1 and 2.\nLemma 1. If Ma \u2740 Mb is a CI-flip w.r.t c \u2208 NM then there is a SMa \u2208 ssSM (Ma) s.t. SMa \u2740 Mb is a CI-flip w.r.t. c \u2208 NSM . Also, if there are SMa \u2208 ssSM (Ma), SMb \u2208 ssSM (Mb) s.t. SMa \u2740 SMb is a CI-flip w.r.t. c \u2208 NSM , then Ma \u2740 Mb is a CI-flip w.r.t c \u2208 NM.\nProof. (sketch) Let c = M+,M\u2212 : M1 \u22b2 M2. The lemma follows from the fact that the set of all CI-flips \u201cinduced\u201d by c \u2208 NSM are of the form\n(S\u2032 \u222a M\u0302+ \u222a M\u03021) \u2740 (S \u2032 \u222a M\u0302+ \u222a M\u03022)\nwith M\u0302+, M\u03021, M\u0302+, M\u03022 defined as above, i.e\nM\u0302+ = \u22c3 {[o]F1,m+(o) | o \u2208 O +}\nM\u03021 = \u22c3 {[o]BmM(o)\u2212m\u2212(o),m1(o) | o \u2208 O1}\nM\u0302+ \u222a M\u03022 = \u22c3 {[o]F1,m+(o)+m2(o) | o \u2208 O + \u222aO2},\nand\nS\u2032 \u2286 \u22c3 {[o]FXo,Yo | o \u2208 O}\nwhere\nXo = m +(o) +m2(o) + 1 Yo = mM(o)\u2212 (m +(o) +m\u2212(o) +m1(o) +m2(o)).\nfor each o \u2208 O. Now, let Ma \u2740 Mb be a CI-flip w.r.t c \u2208 NM, i.e. there is a M\n\u2032 \u2286 (M \\ (M+ \u222aM\u2212 \u222aM1 \u222aM2)), s.t. Ma = (M\u2032 \u222a M+ \u222a M1) and Mb = (M \u2032 \u222a M+ \u222a M2). Then mM\u2032(o) \u2264 (mM(o)\u2212 (m +(o) + m\u2212(o) +m1(o) +m2(o))) for every o \u2208 O and it is relatively straightforward to see that for\nS\u2032 = \u22c3 {[o]FXo ,mM\u2032 (o) | o \u2208 O}\nit is the case that (S\u2032 \u222a M\u0302+ \u222a M\u03022) = Mb. Also, it is straight-forward to verify that SMa \u2208 ssSM (Ma) for SMa := S \u2032 \u222a M\u0302+ \u222a M\u03021.\nOn the other hand, assume now that there are SMa \u2208 ssSM(Ma), SMb \u2208 ssSM (Mb) s.t. SMa \u2740\nSMb is a CI-flip w.r.t. c \u2208 NSM . This means that SMa = (S \u2032 \u222a M\u0302+ \u222a M\u03021) and SMb = (S \u2032 \u222a M\u0302+ \u222a M\u03021) for some S\u2032 as indicated above. Now consider M\u2032 s.t. mM\u2032(o) = |S\n\u2032 \u2229 [o]F 1,mM(o) |. Then it is\nstraightforward to see that Ma = (M\u2032 \u222a M+ \u222a M1), Mb = (M \u2032 \u222a M+ \u222a M2) and Ma \u2740 Mb is a CI-flip w.r.t c \u2208 NM.\nLemma 2. If S >i S \u2032 then there is a sequence of csi flips from S to S \u2032 w.r.t. NSM .\nProof. (sketch) This lemma follows from the definition of >i, csi, and the definition of CI flips for CI statements (Definition 3).\nProposition 4. Let Ma,Mb \u2286 M. If Ma \u2192\u0592NM Mb, then Ma \u2192\u0592NSM Mb. Also, if SMa \u2192\u0592NSM SMb for some SMa \u2208 ssSM (Ma), SMb \u2208 ssSM (Mb) then Ma \u2192\u0592NM Mb.\nProof. We start by proving by induction on k \u2265 0, that if there exists a sequence Ma, . . . ,Mb w.r.t. NM with k CI flips, then there is a sequence Ma, . . . ,Mb w.r.t. NSM with k cs flips. The base case (k = 0) follows from the fact that if Ma \u2283 Mb then Ma \u2283 Mb and hence there is a sequence Ma, . . . ,Mb consisting only of \u2283 flips w.r.t. NSM .\nFor the inductive case assume that there exists a sequence Ma, . . . ,Mb w.r.t NM with k+ 1 \u2265 1 CI flips. Consider the last Mc,Md in the sequence s.t. Mc \u2740 Md is a CI flip. By inductive hypothesis then there is a sequence of flips Ma, . . . ,Mc w.r.t. NSM with k cs flips. By Lemma 1 there exists a SMc \u2208 ssSM (Mc) s.t. SMc \u2740 Md is a CI-flip w.r.t. c \u2208 NSM . Hence Ma, . . . ,Mc, . . . , SMc ,Md, . . . ,Mb is a sequence w.r.t. NSM with k+ 1 cs flips. Here Mc, . . . , SMc is a sequence of (possibly 0) csi flips (that such a sequence exists follows from Lemma 2) and Md, . . . ,Mb is a sequence of (possibly 0) \u2283 flips. We now prove by induction on k \u2265 0, that if there exists a sequence SMa , . . . , SMb w.r.t. NSM with k cs flips for some SMa \u2208 ssSM (Ma) and SMb \u2208 ssSM(Mb), then there exists a sequence Ma, . . . ,Mb w.r.t. NM with k CI flips. The base case (k = 0) follows from the fact that any sequence leading from some SMa \u2208 ssSM (Ma) to some SMb \u2208 ssSM (Mb) with Ma 6= Mb must have at least one \u2283 flip, i.e. Ma \u2283 Mb, and hence Ma,Mb is a sequence consisting only of one \u2283 flip w.r.t. NM.\nFor the inductive case assume that there exists a sequence SMa , . . . , SMb w.r.t. NSM with k+ 1 \u2265 1 cs flips for some SMa \u2208 ssSM (Ma) and SMb \u2208 ssSM (Mb). Consider the last cs flip SMc \u2740 SMd in the sequence, with SMc \u2208 ssSM (Mc), and SMd \u2208 ssSM (Md) for Mc,Mb \u2286 M. By inductive hypothesis, then there is a sequence Ma, . . . ,Mc w.r.t. NM with k CI flips. By Lemma 1 also Mc \u2740 Md is a CI flip w.r.t. NM. Now, by the same argument as for the base case, if Md 6= Mb, Md \u2283 Mb must be the case. Hence Ma, . . . ,Mc,Md, . . . ,Mb is a sequence w.r.t. NM with k CI flips where Md, . . . ,Mb is a sequence of (possibly 0) \u2283 flips.\nCorollary 3. NM is satisfiable iff NSM is satisfiable.\nCorollary 4. Let NM be satisfiable. Then Ma <NM Mb iff Ma <NSM Mb.\nExample 7. The following is the CI-net corresponding to the Cm I-net from Example 6.\n{a6} \u22b2 {b1, . . . , b6, c1, . . . , c6, d1, . . . , d6}; (7)\n{a1},\u2205 : {b6} \u22b2 {c1, c2, c3, d1, d2, d3}; (8)\n{a1, a2, a3}, {b3, b4, b5, b6} : {c4, c5, c6} \u22b2 {d1, d2, d3}; (9)\n{ai \u22b2 ai+1 | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 5}; (10)\n{bi \u22b2 bi+1 | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 5}; (11)\n{ci \u22b2 ci+1 | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 5}; (12)\n{di \u22b2 di+1 | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 5} (13)\nHere\nSM = {a1, . . . , a6, b1, . . . , b6, c1, . . . , c6}.\nNote that the CI-net has an acyclic depdency graph. In fact, it is easy to see that the dependency graph of any CI-net resulting from the reduction of reasoning about an Cm I-net which encodes confined reasoning w.r.t. the C\u21350 I-net in Example 2 and any M \u2208 MO will be acyclic. This is an indirect way of showing (via Corollary 2 and the result from Bouveret et al. mentioned at the end of Section 2) that the C\u21350 I-net in Example 2 is satisfiable. Next we give the derivation w.r.t. the CI-net above corresponding to that of Example 3.\n{a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3}\n. . .

Encoding preferences in evidence aggregation using C\u21350 I-nets\nIn this Section we present a possible use case of C\u21350 I-nets. Specifically, in the context of the relatively recent argument-based system for aggregating evidence about treatments resulting from clinical trials presented in [8, 9]. We refer to the cited works for an in depth description of the system. See also [15] for results on the use of the system for aggregating evidence from studies about lung chemo-radiotherapy.\nIn the already mentioned system evidence resulting from clinical trials is initially collected in the form of evidence tables of which Table 1 could be an extract (see Table 3 in [8] for a larger realworld example on which our example is based). This table summarises possible results stemming from meta-analysis (therefore the label \u201cMA\u201d in the column \u201cType\u201d) comparing two treatments-, \u201cPG\u201d for \u201cprostaglandin analgoue\u201d and \u201cBB\u201d for \u201cbeta-blockers\u201d, for patients who have raised intraocular pressure (i.e. raised pressure in the eye) and are therefore at risk of glaucoma with\nresulting irreversible damage to the optic nerve and retina. Each evidence item has an associated \u201cID\u201d indicated by the entry in the column \u201cID\u201d.\nThe meta-analysis compare the treatments w.r.t. different outcome indicators (see column \u201cOutcome indicator\u201d). The results of the studies are stored in the column labelled \u201cOutcome value\u201d. For simplicity, the outcome values in Table 1 have already been normalised so that the values are desirable. This means that the outcome value in each row express the degree to which the treatment which has fared better in the study corresponding to the row, has indeed done better. The entry under the column \u201cNet outcome\u201d indicates which of the treatments fared better, with \u201c>\u201d meaning that there were better results for prostaglandin analogue and \u201c<\u201d indicating that the results speak for beta-blockers.\nFor respiratory problems (\u201crespiratory prob\u201d), cardiological problems (\u201ccardio prob\u201d), hyperaemia (redness of eyes), and drowsiness the outcome values express the relative risk of suffering the considered problem. E.g. for cardiological problems (evidence item e05), this means that 82 people suffered respiratory problems when taking prostaglandin-analogue for every 100 persons suffering respiratory problems when taking beta-blockers. \u201cchange in IOP\u201d and \u201cacceptable IOP\u201d are outcome indicators referring to raised intraocular pressure, with negative outcome values being good for the first and outcome values greater than 1 being good for the second of these outcome indicators.\nNow, given evidence such as is summarised in Table 1, the question is whether prostaglandin analogue or beta-blockers are better to treat glaucoma in patients who have raised intraocular pressure. The obvious problem being that there is evidence in favour of prostaglandin analogue (namely, evidence items e01 \u2212 e05), but there is also evidence in favour of beta-blockers (e06 \u2212 e09). A first step towards a solution of this problem is to help out the decision process by determining what sets of evidence items that can be used to argue in favour of the treatments are better in terms of preferences over the outcomes (\u201cOutcome indicator\u201d) and magnitudes (\u201cOutcome value\u201d) of the evidence items in such sets. Since we consider that the outcome values are normalised as detailed above, we call such \u201coutcome indicator-value pairs\u201d \u201cbenefits\u201d. More to the point, since for methodological reasons (mainly, to avoid bias and for purposes of reuse), preferences need to be determined independently of the available evidence, the preference relation needs to be in terms of possible sets of benefits, i.e. all possible sets of pairs of (normalised) outcome indicator-value pairs.\nThis process of ordering the evidence in terms of a preference relation on the \u201cbenefit sets\u201d allows for the incorporation of a \u201cpersonalised\u201d dimension in the decision process, i.e. of considerations which have to do with, for example, a specific patient or the experience of the medical professional. Other more \u201cobjective\u201d elements (like the statistical significance of the results obtained via the studies in Table 1 - see the entries under the column \u201cSig\u201d) can be incorporated in\nfurther stages of the decision process as outlined in [8, 9]. In [8, 9] Hunter and Williams only consider the incoporation of preferences between sets of benefits in their system and for specifying such preference relations CI-nets are a natural choice (albeit, not one considered in [8, 9]). First and most obviously because sets of items need to be compared and secondly, because preferences over sets of benefits can also be considered to be monotonic, i.e. having more evidence in favour of a treatment being beneficial can usually be considered to be better than having less evidence. Now, when one considers that there may be more than one evidence item expressing the same benefit, it is clear that at least theoretically the preference relation should be over multi-sets of benefits rather than sets of benefits. But also from a practical perspective it may often be the case that one should at least allow for both preferences over multi-sets as well as sets of benefits to be specified. Enabling this option becomes especially relevant when, as will often be the case, one introduces some abstraction over the outcome indicators and values appearing in the benefit sets (thus, simplifying the task of specifying the preference relation). Example 8 illustrates the use of enabling encoding multi-set preferences by giving a specification of a preference relation over multi-sets of benefits such as those appearing in Table 1 but where we introduce a natural abstraction over the outcome indicators and values. First of all we consider both \u201cchange in IOP\u201d and \u201cacceptable IOP\u201d as part of the \u201csignificant outcomes\u201d which we denote \u201cSO\u201d. Secondly, we partition the outcome indicators into \u201cs\u201d, \u201cm\u201d, and \u201cl\u201d standing for a \u201csmall\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d, and \u201clarge\u201d improvement respectively. We don\u2019t go into the details here, but Table 2 shows a possible result of applying this abstraction to the otucome-indicators and values appearing in Table 1.\nExample 8. The following illustrates the use of C\u21350 I-nets for the specification of a preference relation over sets of benefits such as appear in Table 2. For simplicity we use the shorthands C, D, H, R for (cardio prob, s), (drowsiness,m), (hyperaemia,m), and (respiratory prob, s) respectively,\nwhile Sm := (SO,m) and Ss := (SO, s).\nSm++1 \u22b2 {C,D, R, Ss}##,H++1; (14)\n{C, R}++1 \u22b2 D++1; (15)\nC = 0 : H ++1 \u22b2 D##, {R, Ss}++1; (16)\nR = 0 : H ++1 \u22b2 D##, {C, Ss}++1; (17)\nC = 0 : D++2 \u22b2 R++1; (18)\nR = 0 : D++2 \u22b2 C++1; (19)\nSm = 0 : Ss++1 \u22b2 {C,D, R}++1; (20)\nSm \u2265 1 : {C, R}++1 \u22b2 Ss++1 (21)\nIn Example 8, the C\u21350 I-statement 14 basically says that evidence showing a medium improvement for any of the significant outcomes is preferred over any number of evidence regarding the side-effects cardio problems, respiratory problems, and drowsiness, as well as evidence showing a small improvement regarding the significant outcomes. Also having more evidence (exactly one more piece of evidence) for a medium improvement for the significant outcomes is preferred to having more evidence for a modest improvement w.r.t. hyperaemia (H). The C\u21350 I-statement 15 states that having more evidence for a small improvement for both cardio and respiratory problems is preferred to having more evidence for a modest improvement regarding drowsiness. The C\u21350 I-statements 16 to 19 state preferences for the scenario where one does not have any evidence for some improvement in regards to one of cardio or respiratory problems. In this situation, for example having evidence for a modest improvement in hyperaemia is preferred to having evidence for a small improvement in only one of cardio or respiratory problems. The same holds for drowsiness (C\u21350 I-statements 18 and 19) although the standards here are set a big higher; one needs to have a difference in two studies showing a modest improvement in drowsiness.\nThe C\u21350 I-statement 20 states that if one does not have any evidence for a modest improvement in the significant outcomes, then evidence for even a small improvement for any of the significant outcomes is preferred to evidence showing an improvement in cardio problems, respiratory problems, and drowsiness. On the other hand, if one already has some evidence for a medium improvement in the significant outcomes, then also having more evidence for a small improvement in both cardio and respiratory problems is preferred to having more evidence for a small improvement in the significant outcomes.\nExample 9 now shows the encoding of confined reasoning for the C\u21350 I-net of Example 8 w.r.t.\nthe multiset\nM = {(C, 1), (D, 3), (H, 1), (R, 2), (Sm, 1), (Ss, 1)},\ni.e. the multiset containing all benefits ocurring in Table 2. Example 10 shows the reduction of the Cm I-net from Example 9 to a CI-net.\nExample 9. The following is the encoding of confined reasoning for the C\u21350 I-net of Example 8 w.r.t. the multiset\nM = {(C, 1), (D, 3), (H, 1), (R, 2), (Sm, 1), (Ss, 1)}\nas detailed in Section 4. For the encoding we interpret o## as the maximum number of ocurrences\nof o in M.\n{(Sm, 1)} \u22b2 {(C, 1), (D, 3), (H, 1), (R, 2), (Ss, 1)}; (22)\n{(C, 1), (R, 1)} \u22b2 {(D, 1)}; (23)\n\u2205, {(C, 1)} : {(H, 1)} \u22b2 {(D, 3), (R, 1), (Ss, 1)}; (24)\n\u2205, {(R, 2)} : {(H, 1)} \u22b2 {(D, 3), (C, 1), (Ss, 1)}; (25)\n\u2205, {(C, 1)} : {(D, 2)} \u22b2 {(R, 1)}; (26)\n\u2205, {(R, 2)} : {(D, 2)} \u22b2 {(C, 1)}; (27)\n\u2205, {(Sm, 1)} : {(Ss, 1)} \u22b2 {(C, 1), (D, 1), (R, 1)}; (28)\n{(Sm, 1)},\u2205 : {(C, 1), (R, 1)} \u22b2 {(Ss, 1)} (29)\nExample 10. Next we present the translation of the Cm I-net from Example 9 to a CI-net.\n{Sm1} \u22b2 {C1,D1,D2,D3,H1, R1, R2, Ss1};\n{C1, R2} \u22b2 {D1};\n\u2205, {C1} : {H1} \u22b2 {D1,D2,D3, R1, Ss1};\n\u2205, {R1, R2} : {H1} \u22b2 {D1,D2,D3,C1, Ss1};\n\u2205, {C1} : {D2,D3} \u22b2 {R1};\n\u2205, {R1, R2} : {D2,D3} \u22b2 {C1};\n\u2205, {Sm1} : {Ss1} \u22b2 {C1,D1, R1};\n{Sm1},\u2205 : {C1, R2} \u22b2 {Ss1};\n{D1} \u22b2 {D2};\n{D2} \u22b2 {D3};\n{R1} \u22b2 {R2}\nFigure 2 shows the preference relation induced by the Cm I-net in Example 9, but considering only sets of benefits which all result from the same treatment according to the evidence in Table 2.\nNow, one can take c-consistency w.r.t. M as an additional indicator to trust the specification of preferences in Example 8 is consistent (i.e. the C\u21350 I-net is satisfiable). Under this assumption, since there is a sequence of worsening flips even from {Sm}, corresponding to evidence item e01 in Table 2, to {D,D,D,H}, corresponding to the evidence set {e06, e07, e08, e09} in Table 2, one can conclude from Figure 2 that prostaglandin analogue is preferred to beta-blockers as a treatment for patients who have raised intraocular pressure. Note, nevertheless that if, for example, one were to remove evidence item e01 from Table 2 (e.g. because of statistical significance) then one would not be able to reach a decision between the treatments based on preferences alone.\n6. Conclusion & future work\nIn this work we presented some initial ideas on how to build a framework for encoding monotonic preferences over multiset of goods on top of CI-nets in the sense that at least a restricted form of reasoning, which we called confined reasoning, can be efficiently reduced to reasoning about CInets. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work considering ordinal multiset preferences, certainly in the context of CI-nets. Further investigation is required regarding the adequacy of C\u21350 I-nets (and CI-nets for that manner) for encoding multi-set preferences over goods. We have shown that C\u21350 I-nets can be\nuseful in some contexts, such as for encoding some of the purely qualitative preferences we considered in Section 3 as well as a component of the system of aggregation of evidence stemming from clinical trials by Hunter and Williams. Nevertheless, we have also shown some limitations in our consideration of purely qualitative preferences and it remains to be seen if more complex examples in the context of evidence aggregation can be easily encoded using C\u21350 I-nets. Some progress may be achieved by introducing a further abstraction layer over C\u21350 I-nets.\nWe have built our framework for encoding multi-set preferences on CI-nets because of our interest in preferences over multi-sets of goods, which are monotonic. But it would be interesting to explore encoding multi-set preferences using ideas from other formalisms which have been proposed for encoding preferences over sets, in particular that of Brewka et al.(2010). In this work we also laid the basic ground-work for computational procedures for reasoning about C\u21350 I nets via our characterisation of reasoning about C\u21350 I-nets in terms of confined reasoning and the reduction of the latter, first to reasoning about Cm I-nets, and then to CI-nets. At the very least, our results allow for sound and complete procedures for confined reasoning about C\u21350 I-nets. We note that this situation is in practice less clearly different to that of CI-nets and related formalisms (such as CP nets) than may appear at first glance. The reason is that the complexity of reasoning about CI and CP nets (see [7] for the latter) means that one will also for these formalisms usually have to rely on methods which, for example, are either incomplete or only complete for a restricted subset of the formalisms. Together with the fact that often specifications\nof preference relations induce preference relations which are themselves incomplete, this situation provides an additional reason for complementing preferences with other techniques, such as is argumentation in the system of Hunter and Williams, for purposes of decision making.\nNevertheless, the question of finding a multi-set that captures the preference relation for a particular evaluation context is an important question that remains largely unexplored in our work. Also, finding subclasses of C\u21350 I-nets beyond acyclic ones (or those stemming from CInets) where such a multi-set can be found or where satisfiability can be guaranteed are important questions. Likewise, complexity issues remain to be explored (in particular, for subclasses of C\u21350 I and CI nets; we note that several results regarding CI-nets, such as that for acyclic nets and also for SCI-nets, may be lifted to C\u21350 I-nets).\nEqually relevant is considering adapting techniques for reasoning about CP nets \u201cin practice\u201d such as are considered in [1] (some of which are also discussed for CI-nets in [3]) to the C\u21350 Inet scenario. Finally, computational procedures and systems for CI-nets such as presented in [11, 12, 13] can be adapted to Cm I-nets or, alternatively, be optimised for CI-nets resulting from a reduction from Cm I-nets.\nReferences\n[1] Allen, T.
