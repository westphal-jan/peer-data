Introduction", "text": "There has been a recent surge of interest in developing models that can generate captions for images or videos, termed visual captioning. Most of these approaches learn a probabilistic model of the caption, conditioned on an image or a video [25, 40, 11, 16, 41, 45, 9, 39, 28, 49]. Inspired by the successful use of the encoder-decoder framework employed in machine translation [1, 7, 34], most recent work on visual captioning employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) as an encoder, obtaining a fixed-length vector representation of a given image or video. A recurrent neural network (RNN), typically implemented with long short-term memory (LSTM) units [13], is then employed as a decoder to generate a caption.\nRecent work shows that adding explicit high-level semantic concepts (i.e., tags) of the input image/video can further improve visual captioning. As shown in [42, 47], detecting explicit semantic concepts encoded in an image, and adding\nthis high-level semantic information into the CNN-LSTM framework, has improved performance significantly. Specifically, [42] feeds the semantic concepts as an initialization step into the LSTM decoder. In [47], a model of semantic attention is proposed which selectively attends to semantic concepts through a soft attention mechanism [1]. On the other hand, although significant performance improvements were achieved, integration of semantic concepts into the LSTM-based caption generation process is constrained in these methods; e.g., only through soft attention or initialization of the first step of the LSTM.\n1\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n08 00\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n3 N\nov 2\nIn this paper, we propose the Semantic Compositional Network (SCN) to more effectively assemble the meanings of individual tags to generate the caption that describes the overall meaning of the image, as illustrated in Figure 1a. Similar to the conventional CNN-LSTM-based image captioning framework, a CNN is used to extract the visual feature vector, which is then fed into a LSTM for generating the image caption (for simplicity, in this discussion we refer to images, but the method is also applicable to video). However, unlike the conventional LSTM, the SCN extends each weight matrix of the conventional LSTM to an ensemble of tag-dependent weight matrices, subject to the probabilities that the tags are present in the image. These tag-dependent weight matrices form a weight tensor with a large number of parameters. In order to make learning feasible, we factorize that tensor to be a three-way matrix product, which dramatically reduces the number of free parameters to be learned, while also yielding excellent performance.\nFigure 1b illustrates the semantic composition manifested in the SCN model. Specifically, a set of semantic concepts, such as \u201cbaby, holding, toothbrush, mouth\u201d, are detected with high probabilities. If only one semantic concept is turned on, the model will generate a description covering only part of the input image, as shown in sentences 1-5 of Figure 1b; however, by assembling all these semantic concepts, the SCN is able to generate a comprehensive description \u201ca baby holding a toothbrush in its mouth\u201d. More interestingly, as shown in sentences 6-8 of Figure 1b, the SCN also has great flexibility to adjust the generation of the caption by changing certain semantic concepts.\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) We propose the SCN to effectively compose individual semantic concepts for image captioning. (ii) We perform comprehensive evaluations on two image captioning benchmarks, demonstrating that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches by a substantial margin. For example, as reported by the COCO official test server, we achieve a BLEU-4 of 33.1, an improvement of 1.5 points over the current published state-of-the-art [47]. (iii) We extend the proposed framework from image captioning to video captioning, demonstrating the versatility of the proposed model. (iv) We also perform a detailed analysis to study the SCN, showing that the model can adjust the caption smoothly by modifying the tags."}, {"heading": "2. Related work", "text": "We focus on recent neural-network-based literature for caption generation, as these are most relevant to our work. Such models typically extract a visual feature vector via a CNN, and then send that vector to a language model for caption generation. Representative works include [6, 8, 9, 16, 19, 20, 25, 41] for image captioning and [9, 39, 40, 49, 2] for video captioning. The differences of the various methods\nmainly lie in the types of CNN architectures and language models. For example, the vanilla RNN [10] was used in [25, 16], while the LSTM [13] was used in [41, 39, 40]. The visual feature vector was only fed into the RNN once at the first time step in [41, 16], while it was used at each time step of the RNN in [25].\nMost recently, [45] utilized an attention-based mechanism to learn where to focus in the image during caption generation. This work was followed by [46] which introduced a review module to improve the attention mechanism and [24] which proposed a method to improve the correctness of visual attention. In addition, a variational autoencoder was developed in [30] for image captioning. Other related work for video captioning includes [28], which learned a joint embedding of visual features and associated captions.\nAnother class of models uses semantic information for caption generation. Specifically, [14] applied retrieved sentences as additional semantic information to guide the LSTM when generating captions, while [11, 42, 47] applied a semantic-concept-detection process before generating sentences. This line of methods represents the current state of the art for image captioning. Our proposed model also lies in this category; however, distinct from the aforementioned approaches, our model uses weight tensors in LSTM units. This allows learning an ensemble of semantic-conceptdependent weight matrices for generating the caption.\nThe tensor factorization method is used to make the SCN compact and simplify learning. Similar ideas have been exploited in [21, 26, 32, 33, 35, 43]. In [9, 15, 19] the authors also briefly discussed using the tensor factorization method for image captioning. Specifically, visual features extracted from CNNs are utilized in [9, 19], and an inferred scene vector is used in [15] for tensor factorization. In contrast to these works, we use the semantic-concept vector that is formed by the probabilities of all tags to weight the basis LSTM weight matrices in the ensemble. Our semantic-concept vector is more powerful than the visual-feature vector [9, 19] and the scene vector [15] in terms of providing explicit semantic information of an image, hence leading to significantly better performance, as shown in our quantitative evaluation. In addition, the usage of semantic concepts also makes the proposed SCN more interpretable than [9, 15, 19], as shown in our qualitative analysis, since each unit in the semanticconcept vector corresponds to an explicit tag."}, {"heading": "3.

We first extract feature vector v(I), which is often the top-layer features of a pretrained CNN.

The probability of caption X given image feature vector v is defined as\np(X|I) = \u220fT\nt=1p(xt|x0, . . . ,xt\u22121,v) , (1)\nwhere x0 is defined as a special start-of-the-sentence token. All the words in the caption are sequentially generated using a RNN, until the end-of-the-sentence symbol is generated. Specifically, each conditional p(xt|x<t,v) is specified as softmax(Vht), where ht is recursively updated through ht = H(wt\u22121,ht\u22121,v), and h0 is defined as a zero vector (h0 is not updated during training). V is the weight matrix connecting the RNN\u2019s hidden state, used for computing a distribution over words. Bias terms are omitted for simplicity throughout the paper.\nWithout loss of generality, we begin by discussing an RNN with a simple transition functionH(\u00b7); this is generalized in Section 3.4 to the LSTM. Specifically,H(\u00b7) is defined as\nht = \u03c3(Wxt\u22121 +Uht\u22121 + 1(t = 1) \u00b7Cv) , (2)\nwhere \u03c3(\u00b7) is a logistic sigmoid function, and 1(\u00b7) represents an indicator function.

Semantic concept detection", "text": "The SCN developed below is based on the detection of semantic concepts, i.e., tags, in the image under test.

SCN-RNN", "text": "The SCN extends each weight matrix of the conventional RNN to be an ensemble of a set of tag-dependent weight matrices, subjective to the probabilities that the tags are present in the image.

W(s) \u2208 Rnh\u00d7nx and U(s) \u2208 Rnh\u00d7nh can be specified as\nW(s) = K\u2211 k=1 skWT [k], U(s) = K\u2211 k=1 skUT [k] , (5)\nwhere sk is the k-th element in s; WT [k] and UT [k] denote the k-th 2D \u201cslice\u201d of WT and UT , respectively. The probability of the k-th semantic concept, sk, is associated with a pair of RNN weight matrices WT [k] and UT [k], implicitly specifying K RNNs in total. Consequently, training such a model as defined in (4) and (5) can be interpreted as jointly training an ensemble of K RNNs.\nThough appealing, the number of parameters is proportional toK, which is prohibitive for largeK (e.g.,K = 1000 for COCO). In order to remedy this problem, we adopt ideas from [26] to factorize W(s) and U(s) defined in (5) as\nW(s) = Wa \u00b7 diag(Wbs) \u00b7Wc , (6) U(s) = Ua \u00b7 diag(Ubs) \u00b7Uc , (7)\nwhere Wa \u2208 Rnh\u00d7nf , Wb \u2208 Rnf\u00d7K and Wc \u2208 Rnf\u00d7nx .

Hence, via the decomposition in (6) and (7), we effectively learn an ensemble of K sets of RNN parameters, one for each semantic concept. This is efficiently done by sharing Wa and Wc when composing each member of the ensemble. The weight with which the k-th slice of this tensor contributes to the RNN parameters for a given image is dependent on the respective probability sk with which the k-th semantic concept is inferred to be associated with image I."}, {"heading": "3.4.

While the LSTM state is initialized with the overall visual context v, an ensemble of K sets of LSTM parameters is utilized when decoding, weighted by the semantic-concept vector s, to generate the caption.\nModel learning Given the image I and associated caption X, the objective function is the sum of the log-likelihood of the caption conditioned on the image representation:\nlog p(X|I) = \u2211T\nt=1p(xt|x0, . . . ,xt\u22121,v, s) .

Qualitative analysis", "text": "Figure 3 shows three examples to illustrate the semantic composition on caption generation. Our model properly describes the image content by using the correctly detected tags. By manually replacing specific tags, our model can adjust the caption smoothly.

Our model is also able to generate novel captions that are highly unlikely to occur in real life. For instance, in the middle image, by replacing the tag \u201croad\u201d and \u201cstreet\u201d with \u201cocean\u201d, our model imagines \u201ca bus driving in the ocean\u201d; in the right image, by replacing the tag \u201cfield\u201d with \u201csnow\u201d, our model dreams \u201ca group of zebras standing in the snow\u201d.\nSCN not only picks up the tags well (and imagines the corresponding scenes), but also selects the right functional words for different concepts to form syntactically correct caption. As illustrated in sentence 6 of Figure 1b, by re-\nplacing the tag \u201cbaby\u201d with \u201cgirl\u201d, the generated captions not only changes \u201ca baby\u201d to \u201ca little girl\u201d, but more importantly, changes \u201cin its mouth\u201d to \u201cin her mouth\u201d. In addition, the SCN also infers the underlying semantic relatedness between different tags. As illustrated in sentence 4 of Figure 1b, when only switching on the tag \u201cmouth\u201d, the generated caption becomes \u201ca man with a toothbrush\u201d, indicating the semantic closeness between \u201cmouth\u201d, \u201cman\u201d and \u201ctoothbrush\u201d. By further switching on \u201cbaby\u201d, we generate a more detailed description \u201ca baby brushing its teeth\u201d.\nIn order to demonstrate the advantage of our model, we present examples of generated captions on COCO with various methods in Figure 4, along with the detected tags. As can be seen, our model often generates more reasonable captions than LSTM-R, due to the use of high-level semantic concepts. For example, in the first image, LSTM-R outputs an irrelevant caption to the image, while the detection of \u201ctable\u201d and \u201clibrary\u201d helps our model to generate more sensible caption. Further, although both our model and LSTM-RT2 utilize detected tags for caption generation, our model often depicts the image content more comprehensively; LSTM-\nRT2 has a larger potential to miss important details in the image. For instance, in the 3rd image, the tag \u201cred\u201d appears in the caption generated by our model, which is missed by LSTM-RT2. This observation might be due to the fact that the SCN provides a better approach to fuse tag information into the process of caption generation. Similiar observations can also be found in the video captioning experiments, as demonstrated in Figure 5."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "We have presented Semantic Compositional Network (SCN), a new framework to effectively compose the individual semantic meaning of tags for visual captioning. The SCN extends each weight matrix of the conventional LSTM to be a three-way matrix product, with one of these matrices dependent on the inferred tags. Consequently, the SCN can be viewed an ensemble of tag-dependent LSTM bases, with the contribution of each LSTM basis unit proportional to the likelihood that the tag is present in the image. Experiments conducted on three visual captioning datasets validate the superiority of the proposed approach.\nAcknowledgements Most of this work was done when the first author was an intern at Microsoft Research.
