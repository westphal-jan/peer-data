This involves these steps:\n1. Argument identification. In the first step, arguments concerning a given topic are identified in a given text and attacking and supporting relationships between the propositions are established. The result is an argumentation graph. In the future we hope to use argumentation mining techniques to automate this step. At this time, this is done manually by marking up some text.\n2. Initial plausibility assessment. The propositions (represented as the nodes of the argumentation graph) are assigned an initial plausibility based on Web searches.\n3. Acceptability degree calculation. The acceptability degree of the propositions are calculated. This calculation depends on the plausibility assessment of the propositions and the attacks and supports between them.\n4. Recommendation. Based on the acceptability degree calculation the system determines an answer and the argument for it.\n5. User Interaction. The user is able to explore the argument graph and may manually change the plausibility rating of any proposition. The system recalculates the acceptability degrees and its recommendation.\nIn this paper we focus on the third step: the calculation of acceptability degrees of the propositions of the arguments. For the sake of this paper we treat the propositions as arguments in an argument network.1\nThis is an evaluation of a weighted graphs that are bipolar, i.e. contain both attack and support relations. Weighted argumentation graphs have been widely discussed, in particular in [5, 6, 7], and also for the bipolar case [8], but not considering initial weightings. Given that the result of the initial plausibility assessment provide a continuous initial weighting, the most relevant previous work is on the evaluation argumentation graphs with support relationships by Leila Amgoud and Jonathan Ben-Naim [1] and an unpulished work by the same authors and two other authors on the evaluation of argumentation graphs with attack relationships [2].\nSince for our purposes we need to consider bipolar [9] argumentation graphs that contain both attack and support relationships, we need to generalise the results of [1] and [2]. The result is a novel acceptability semantics for weighted argumentation graphs that contain both attacks and supports between arguments. The outline of the paper follows the presentations in [1, 2]. In section 2 we introduce the basic notions. In section 4 we discuss the features an acceptability semantics should have. These features are characterised axiomatically. We discuss how these axioms relate to the axioms from [1, 2].\nIn section 5 we discuss a semantics that meets the characteristics from section 4 and show that it converges. In section 7 we compare our approach to [1, 2] in more detail and in 10 we discuss some limitations of our approach and future work."}, {"heading": "2 Basic Concepts", "text": "In [1, 2] argumentation graphs are represented as a set of weighted nodes, which represent the attacks, and a set of vertices, which represent an attack relationship or a support relationship, respectively. We choose an alternative representation. An argument graph consists of three elements: a vector of arguments A = a1, . . . an, a matrix G that determines the attack and support relationships between the arguments, and a weighting w of the arguments. More specifically, G is a square matrix of order n, which elements are either \u22121, 0 or 1. Given a matrix G, if the element gij = 1, then this is intended to represent that the argument aj supports the argument ai; if gij = \u22121, then argument aj attacks ai; and if gij = 0, then aj does neither support nor attack\n1 This is a significant simplification, since it only allows us to represent convergent arguments in the sense of [4]. Further, this approach does not consider that the strength of a support or attack may be weighted as well; see section 10.\nai. The vector w assigns to each argument a real number to represent its initial plausibility. The larger the w(a) for some argument a is, the larger its initial plausibility. 0 is is the neutral value (neither plausible nor implausible). Negative values denote implausibility. Note that this deviates from [1, 2], where only values in [0, 1] are considered. Our approach has greater flexibility. For example, we plan to use hit counts as initial plausibilities, which can be used directly without any normalisation.\nDefinition 1 (Weighted Attack/Support Argumentation Graph) A weighted attack/support argumentation graph (wasa) is a triple A = \u3008A, G, w\u3009, where\n\u2022 A is a vector of size n (for some n \u2208 N+), where all components of A are pairwise distinct.\n\u2022 G = {gij} is a square matrix of order n where gij \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1},\n\u2022 w is a vector in Rn.\nIf A = \u3008A, G, w\u3009 is a wasa and A is of size n, then A consists of n arguments.\nExample 1\nA =\n\u2329(\na1 a2 a3 a4\n)\n,\n(\n0 0 0 0 1 1 \u22121 \u22121 1 1 0 \u22121 0 0 0 0\n)\n,\n(\n0.5 2 2 1\n)\u232a\na1 0.5\n//\na2 2\n\u2701\u2701 \u2701\u2701 \u2701\u2701 \u2701\u2701 \u2701\na3 2 \u2022\u2701\u2701\u2701\u2701\u2701\u2701\u2701\u2701\u2701 a4 1 \u2022 \u2022\nThe wasa A in Example 1 consists of four arguments, namely a1, a2, a3, a4. The second component of A determines that a1 and a4 are neither attacked nor supported. a1 and a2 support both a2 and a3. a2 is attacked by a3 and a4, and a3 is attacked by a4. The third component of A assigns weights to the arguments, namely w(a1) = 0.5, w(a2) = 2, w(a3) = 2 and w(a4) = 1. Example 1 also contains a graphical representation of A, which represents support relationships as connections with an arrow head and attacks as connections with a round head.\nA wasa is a representation of a set of arguments, their attack and support relationships, and the initial plausibility of the arguments. The question that this paper needs to address is: How do we calculate the acceptability of the arguments based on their initial plausibility and their relations? Following the terminology in [1, 2], an answer to this question is called an acceptability semantics:\nDefinition 2 (Acceptability Semantics) An acceptability semantics is a function S transforming any wasa A = \u3008A, G, w\u3009 into a vec-\ntor DegS A in Rn, where n is the number of arguments in A. For any argument ai in A, DegSA(ai) is called the acceptability degree of ai.\nObviously, there are many possible acceptability semantics. Example 2 defines the acceptability semantics SG that may have been embraced by the Greek sophist Gorgias, who believed that knowledge and communication is impossible.\nExample 2 (Gorgias Semantics) SG is the function such that for, any wasa A that consists of n arguments, SG(A) is a vector of size n\nsuch that SG(A) = ( 0 ... 0 ) .\nAccording the Georgias Semantics any argument is equally accept-\nable and unacceptable, thus, DegS G\nA (a) = 0 for any argument a in any\nwasa A. Most people would probably agree that SG does not provide us with a useful tool for analysing argumentations. However, it raises the questions what requirements a suitable acceptability semantics should meet. We will discuss this question in the section 4."}, {"heading": "3 Notation and auxiliary definitions", "text": "Unless otherwise specified A is a wasa such that A = \u3008A, G, w\u3009. If a1, . . . , an are the components of A we denote by\n\u2022 AttA(ai) the set of all attackers of ai in A, that is AttA(ai) = {aj| gij = \u22121};\n\u2022 Sup A (ai) the set of all supporters of ai in A, that is SupA(ai) =\n{aj| gij = 1};\n\u2022 BackA(ai) and DetrA(ai) are the sets of the backers of ai and the set of the detractors of ai. They are defined recursively as the set of all arguments that directly or indirectly support ai (e.g., attacking an attacker of ai) and, respectively, the set of all arguments that directly or indirectly attack ai (e.g., supporting an attacker of ai). Thus, BackA(ai) and DetrA(ai) are the minimal sets such that the following equations hold:\nBackA(ai) = SupA(ai)\u222a{aj | \u2203x : aj \u2208 SupA(x)\u2227x \u2208 BackA(ai)}\n\u222a {aj| \u2203x : aj \u2208 AttA(x) \u2227 x \u2208 DetrA(ai)}\nDetrA(ai) = AttA(ai)\u222a{aj | \u2203x : aj \u2208 AttA(x)\u2227x \u2208 BackA(ai)}\n\u222a {aj| \u2203x : aj \u2208 SupA(x) \u2227 x \u2208 DetrA(ai)}\n\u2022 ParentA(ai) is the ith matrix row (gi1, . . . , gin) of G. It contains the parents of ai in the argument graph and hence combines the information of Sup\nA (ai) and AttA(ai) in one vector.\nDefinition 3 (Influence) Given a wasa A = \u3008A, G, w\u3009 and a vector v \u2208 Rn (e.g. v could be w), the influence of v on ai is defined as the number\n\u2211\nb\u2208Sup A (ai)\nv(b) \u2212 \u2211\nc\u2208AttA(ai)\nv(c) = ParentA(ai)v\nThe influence of v in general is computed as the vector of the individual influences:\n(\nParentA(a1)v ... ParentA(an)v\n)\n= Gv\nNote that supporters and attackers cancel each other out when computing the influence.

Note that the degree can be computed from the initial plausibility by a fixed linear transformation given by the propagation matrix.\nLet indegree(G) be the maximal indegree, i.e. the maximum number of edges leading into an argument in A. For d \u2264 indegree(G), the direct aggregation semantics is not well-defined in general. Example 4 provides an example, where fd does not converge.\nExample 4 Assume d = indegree(G) and consider an argument with an initial plausibility 1 that attacks itself. In this case d = indegree(G) = 1 and\nA = \u3008( a ) , (\u22121 ) , ( 1 )\u3009 or, graphically: A = a 1\n\u2022\nIn this case f2id (a) = 1 and f 2i+1 d (a) = 0.\nTheorem 1 For d > indegree(G), the direct aggregation semantics is well-defined and convergecs to (I \u2212 1\nd G)\u22121w.\nFor the proof, we need the following from [10], Corolloray 5.6.16:\nFact 1 If 9 9 is a matrix norm, and if 9A9 < 1, then I \u2212 A is invertible and\n(I \u2212A)\u22121 = \u221e \u2211\ni=0\nAi\nProof (of Thm. 1): We need to show that\n\u221e \u2211\ni=0\n( 1\nd G)iw\nconverges. Note that the maximum row sum norm 9 9\u221e defined by\n9G9\u221e = max i=1,...,n\n\u2211\nj=1,...,n\n|gij |\ncoincides with the maximal indgree, i.e. 9G9\u221e = indegree(G). Hence, we have\n9 1\nd G9\u221e \u2264\nindegree(G)\nd < 1\nBy Fact 1, this implies that I \u2212 1 d G is invertible and\nDegd A =\n\u221e \u2211\ni=0\n( 1\nd G)iw = (I \u2212\n1 d G)\u22121w\nTheorem 2 D = Degd A is the unique solution of the equation\nD = w + 1\nd GD\n(degree = initial plausiblity + damped influence)\nProof: The equation can be rewritten as (I \u2212 1 d G)D = w, which shows that D = (I \u2212 1 d G)\u22121w = Degd A is a solution. Moreover, if D = w + 1 d GD, by suceessively unfolding, we get\nD =\n\u221e \u2211\ni=0\n( 1\nd G)iw = Degd A\nIn the sequel, we will examine direct aggregation semantics w.r.t. the properties introduced in Sect. 4. Generally, we will assume that d is chosen such that d > indegree(G), e.g. d = indegree(G) + 1. This means that d depends on the argument matrix (graph). Sometimes, it is more suitable to choose a global d that independent of the matrix. We will indicate these cases.\nExample 5 If d = indegree(G) + 1 (or generally, d does depend on indegree(G)), direct aggregation semantics does not satisfy (Independence). Consider A = \u3008( a ) , ( 1 ) , ( 1 )\u3009 and A\u2032 = \u3008 (\na b c\n) , ( \u22121 0 0 0 \u22121 \u22121 0 \u22121 \u22121 ) , ( 1 1 1 ) \u3009.\nThen Degd A = ( 23 ) (with d = 2), but Deg d A\u2032 =\n(\n3 4 3 5 3 5\n)\n(with d = 3).\nTheorem 3 If d is chosen globally (which implies that only wasas of maximal indegree < d are considered), direct aggregation semantics satisfies (Independence).\nProof: Degd A (a) =\n( \u2211\u221e\ni=0 ( 1 d G)iw\n) (a)6 = (\n\u2211\u221e i=0 ( 1 d\n(\nGi 0 0 (G\u2032)i\n) ) ( ww\u2032 ) )\n(a) = ( \u2211\u221e\ni=0 ( 1 d\n(\nG 0 0 G\u2032\n) )iw\u2020 ) (a) = ( \u2211\u221e i=0 ( 1 d G\u2020)iw\u2020 ) (a) = Degd A\u2295A\u2032(a).\nOur semantics enjoys all other desirable properties (the proof has been relegated to the appendix):\n6Given a vector v, we use the notation v(aj) for the value vj . This is particularly convenient if we do not have the index j at hand.\nTheorem 4 Direct aggregation semantics satisfies (Anonymity), (Equivalence), (Directionality), (Conservativity), (Strong proportionality), (Neutrality), (Monotony), (Impact), (Reinforcement), (Neutralisation) and (Continuity).\nWe will now examine the behaviour of direct aggregation semantics for specific cases. As noted above, the degree is computed from the initial plausibility by multiplication with the propagation matrix. Hence, it suffices to examine propagation matrices, which are independent of the initial plausibility. Indeed, propagation matrices can be computed easily by matrix inversion, see Thm. 1. We list propagation matrices for a number of small argument graphs, in terms of the damping factor d. We begin with acyclic graphs. An isolated argument will be not affected at all:\na (1)\nEdges in the argument graph propagate (positive or negative) influence with strength 1\nd :\na // b (\n1 0 1 d 1\n) a \u2022b ( 1 0 \u2212 1\nd 1\n)\nInfluence of arguments can also propagated along k edges, resulting in a factor 1\ndk . For k = 2, we get:\na // b // c 1 d2\n(\nd2 0 0 d d2 0 1 d d2\n)\na \u2022b \u2022c 1 d2\n(\nd2 0 0 \u2212d d2 0 1 \u2212d d2\n)\na // b \u2022c 1 d2\n(\nd2 0 0 d d2 0 \u22121 \u2212d d2\n)\na \u2022b // c 1 d2\n(\nd2 0 0 \u2212d d2 0 \u22121 d d2\n)\nNow to cyclic graphs. The simplest case is self-support resp. selfattack, resulting in a slight strengthening resp. weakening of the weight:\na ( dd\u22121 ) a \u2022 ( dd+1 )\nSince a chain of two attacks is a support, both mutual attack and support lead to a slight self-support as well, while an attack-support pair (called a vicious circle in [11]) leads to a slight self-attack of both arguments. We also show the combination with explicits self-supports\nand self-attacks:\na oo // b 1 d2\u22121\n(\nd2 d d d2\n)\na\u2022 \u2022b 1 d2\u22121\n(\nd2 \u2212d \u2212d d2\n)\na // b\u2022 1 d2+1\n(\nd2 \u2212d d d2\n)\na // b \u2022 1\nd2\u2212r+1\n(\nd2\u2212d \u2212d d d2\n)\na oo // b 1 d2\u2212d\u22121\n(\nd2\u2212d d d d2\n) a\u2022 \u2022b \u2022\n1 d2+d\u22121\n(\nd2+d \u2212d \u2212d d2\n)\na oo // b\n1\nd\u22122\n(\nd\u22121 1 1 d\u22121\n)\na \u2022 \u2022 \u2022b\n\u2022 1\nd+2\n(\nd+1 \u22121 \u22121 d+1\n)\nForall arguments in a cycle of length three, we get a slight selfsupport (left hand-side, non-vicious circles) or self-attack of the argument (right hand-side, vicious circle in the sense of [11]):\na // b\n\u271f\u271f \u271f\u271f \u271f\u271f \u271f\nc\n[[\u273b\u273b\u273b\u273b\u273b\u273b\u273b\n1 d3\u22121\n(\nd3 d d2 d2 d3 d d d2 d3\n)\na \u2022b\n\u2022\u271f \u271f\u271f \u271f\u271f \u271f\u271f\nc\n\u2022\u273b\u273b\u273b\u273b\u273b\u273b\u273b\n1 d3+1\n(\nd3 d \u2212d2\n\u2212d2 d3 d d \u2212d2 d3\n)\na \u2022b\n\u2022\u271f \u271f\u271f \u271f\u271f \u271f\u271f\nc\n[[\u273b\u273b\u273b\u273b\u273b\u273b\u273b\n1 d3\u22121\n(\nd3 \u2212d d2 \u2212d2 d3 \u2212d d \u2212d2 d3\n)\na // b\n\u271f\u271f \u271f\u271f \u271f\u271f \u271f\nc\n\u2022\u273b\u273b\u273b\u273b\u273b\u273b\u273b\n1 d3+1\n(\nd3 \u2212d \u2212d2 d2 d3 \u2212d d d2 d3\n)\nFinally, we show various cycles of length four, all of which show a slight self-support.
