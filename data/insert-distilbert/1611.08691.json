Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in multiwinner elections. In this setting, there is a set of agents who entertain preferences over a set of alternatives. Based on these preferences, the goal is to select a committee, i.e., a (fixedsize) subset of the alternatives. Preferences are usually specified either as rankings, i.e., complete linear orders over the set of all alternatives [e.g., Elkind et al., 2014], or as approval votes, i.e., yes/no assessments of all the alternatives [e.g., Kilgour et al., 2006]. We are particularly interested in the latter variant, in which each agent can be thought of as specifying a subset of alternatives that are \u201cacceptable\u201d for that agent.\nThe decision scenario modeled by multiwinner elections\u2014selecting a subset of objects from a potentially much larger pool of available objects\u2014is ubiquitous: picking players to form a sports team, selecting items to display in an online shop, choosing the board of directors of a company, etc. Many of these scenarios are reminiscent of parliamentary elections, a topic that has been studied in great detail by political scientists. In a parliamentary election, the candidates are traditionally organized in political parties and the election determines how many parliamentary seats a party is allocated.\nUnder so-called proportional representation systems with \u201cclosed party lists,\u201d a voter is allowed to give her vote to one and only one party. In a sense, this forces the voter to approve all candidates from one party and no candidates from any other party. Counting such ballots, and deciding how many candidates are elected from each list, is an apportionment problem. Any apportionment\nproblem can be seen as a very simple approval voting instance: all voters approve all the candidates from their chosen party, and only those.\nThe present paper formally establishes and explores this analogy between multiwinner elections and apportionment problems. We show how an apportionment problem can be phrased as an instance of an approval-based multiwinner election, thereby rendering multiwinner rules applicable to the apportionment setting. As a result, every approval-based multiwinner rule induces a method of apportionment. Exploring this link between multiwinner rules and apportionment methods is interesting for at least two reasons. First, observing what kind of apportionment method a given multiwinner rule induces yields new insights into the nature of the rule. Second, every multiwinner rule inducing a given apportionment method can be seen as an extension of the apportionment method to a more general setting where candidates have no party affiliations (or party affiliations are ignored in the election process).\nThe relevance of the latter perspective is due to the realization that closed-list systems have a number of drawbacks. For instance, it is a known feature of closed-list systems that candidates tend to campaign within their parties (for being placed on a good position on the party list), rather than to campaign for the citizens\u2019 votes. Closed-list systems thus favor party discipline, at the potential expense of alienating the political elites from the citizens [e.g., see Colomer, 2011, Andre\u0301 et al., 2015, Ames, 1995, Chang, 2005].\nIn an attempt to overcome these drawbacks, many countries use \u201copen-list\u201d systems, leaving some flexibility to the voters by allowing them to vote for specific candidates inside the chosen party list. In some (rare) cases, voters are given even more freedom. Under so-called \u201cpanachage\u201d systems, sometimes used in Luxembourg and in France, voters can vote for candidates from different parties. And sometimes voters vote directly for the candidates and the outcome of elections does not depend on how candidates are grouped into parties. Such is the case for some elections in Switzerland, were variants of multi-winner approval voting are used in several cantons [see Laslier and Van der Straeten, 2016]. In a recent book, Renwick and Pilet [2016] extensively examine this \u201ctrend towards greater personalization,\u201d which they see as \u201cone of the key shifts in contemporary politics.\u201d They find that this trend \u201cis indeed changing core democratic institutions.\u201d\nAfter formally establishing the link between approval-based multiwinner rules and apportionment methods, we consider several multiwinner rules and observe that they induce (and extend) apportionment methods that are well-established in the apportionment literature. For instance, Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) induces the D\u2019Hondt method (aka Jefferson method) and Monroe\u2019s rule induces the largest remainder method (aka Hamilton method). We also consider properties of apportionment methods (such as lower quota or the Penrose condition) and exhibit multiwinner rules that induce apportionment methods satisfying these properties.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formally introduces both the apportionment problem and the multiwinner election setting. Section 3 shows how approval-based multiwinner rules can be employed as apportionment methods, and contains several results related to proportional representation. Section 4 is devoted to non-proportional representation in the form of degressive proportionality and thresholds, and Section 5 concludes."}, {"heading": "2 The Apportionment Problem and Approval-Based Multiwinner Elections", "text": "In this section we provide the formal setting for the apportionment problem and for approval-based multiwinner elections.

Every voter votes for exactly one party, and for each i \u2208 [p], we let vi denote the number of votes that party Pi receives, i.e., the number of voters who voted for Pi. The goal is to allocate h (parliamentary) seats among the parties. Formally, an instance of the apportionment problem is given by a tuple (v, h), where v = (v1, . . . , vp) \u2208 Np is the vote distribution and h is the number of seats to distribute. We use v+ to denote the total number of votes, v+ = \u2211p i=1 vi. Throughout this paper, we assume that vi > 0 for all i \u2208 [p] and h > 0. An apportionment method M maps every instance (v, h) to a nonempty set1 M(v, h) of seat distributions. A seat distribution is a vector (x1, . . . , xp) \u2208 N p 0 with \u2211p i=1 xi = h. Here, xi corresponds to the number of seats allocated to party Pi. In our proofs we often argue about seat distributions that result from a given seat distribution by taking away a single seat from a party and giving it to another party. For a seat distribution x = (x1, . . . , xp) and two parties Pi and Pj such that xi > 0, let xiyj denote the seat distribution x\u2032 with x\u2032i = xi \u2212 1, x \u2032 j = xj + 1, and x \u2032 \u2113 = x\u2113 for all \u2113 6= i, j."}, {"heading": "2.1.1 Divisor Methods", "text": "A rich and very well-studied class of apportionment methods is defined via divisor sequences.\nDefinition 1 (Divisor method). Let d = (d(0), d(1), d(2), . . .) be a sequence with 0 < d(j) \u2264 d(j + 1) for all j \u2208 N0. The divisor method based on d is the apportionment method that maps a given instance (v, h) to the set of all seat allocations that can result from the following procedure: Start with the empty seat allocation (0, . . . , 0) and iteratively assign a seat to a party Pi maximizing vi d(si) where si is the number of seats that have already been allocated to party Pi.\nDivisor methods are often defined in a procedurally different, but mathematically equivalent way [see Balinski and Young, 1982, Proposition 3.3].2 Two prominent divisor methods are the D\u2019Hondt method and the Sainte-Lague\u0308 method.\nDefinition 2 (D\u2019Hondt method). The D\u2019Hondt method (aka Jefferson method or HagenbachBischoff method) is the divisor method based on dD\u2019Hondt = (1, 2, 3, . . .). Therefore, in each round,\n1Most apportionment methods allow for ties. In this paper we do not consider any specific tie-breaking rule but rather assume that the apportionment methods might return several tied outcomes.\n2Divisor methods with d(0) = 0 can also be defined. For such methods, which Pukelsheim [2014] calls impervious, the conventions vi\n0 = \u221e and vi 0 \u2265 vj 0\n\u21d4 vi \u2265 vj are used. Examples of impervious divisor methods are the methods due to Huntington and Hill, Adams, and Dean [see Balinski and Young, 1982].\na seat is allocated to a party Pi maximizing vi\nsi+1 , where si is the number of seats that have already\nbeen allocated to party Pi.\nThe D\u2019Hondt method was first used in 1791 to apportion seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, and currently it is used as a legislative procedure in over 40 countries.\nDefinition 3 (Sainte-Lague\u0308 method). The Sainte-Lague\u0308 method (aka Webster method, Schepers method, or method of major fractions) is the divisor method based on dSL = (1, 3, 5, . . .). Therefore, in each round, a seat is allocated to a party Pi maximizing\nvi 2si+1 , where si is the number of seats that have already been allocated to party Pi.\nThe Sainte-Lague\u0308 method was first adopted in 1842 for allocating seats in the United States House of Representatives, and currently it is used for parliamentary election in some countries (for instance Latvia, New Zealand, Norway, or Sweden) and for several state-level legislatures in Germany.\nThe following example illustrates the two methods defined above.\nExample 1. Consider the instance with four parties P1, P2, P3, P4 and 100 voters such that (v1, v2, v3, v4) = (6, 7, 39, 48), and assume that there are h = 10 seats to be allocated. The outcomes of the D\u2019Hondt method and the Sainte-Lague\u0308 method, which can be computed with the help of Table 1, are (0, 0, 4, 6) and (1, 1, 4, 4), respectively.\nAs we can see in the above example, different divisor methods might give different results for some instances of the apportionment problem. In particular, the D\u2019Hondt method slightly favors large parties over small ones in comparison to the Sainte-Lague\u0308 method [Pukelsheim, 2014].\nSeveral other divisor methods such as the Huntington-Hill method (aka the method of equal proportions), the Adams method (aka method of smallest divisors), and the Dean method are studied in the literature on fair representation. We refer the reader to the books of Balinski and Young [1982] and Pukelsheim [2014] for an extensive overview."}, {"heading": "2.1.2 The Largest Remainder Method", "text": "The largest remainder method is the most well-known apportionment method that is not a divisor method. Recall that v+ = \u2211p i=1 vi denotes the total number of votes.\nDefinition 4 (Largest remainder method). The largest remainder method (aka Hamilton method or Hare-Niemeyer method) is defined via two steps. In the first step, each party Pi is allocated \u230a\nvih v+\n\u230b seats. In the second step, the remaining seats are distributed among the parties so that each party gets at most one of them. To do so, the parties are sorted according to the remainders vih\nv+ \u2212 \u230avih v+ \u230b\nand the remaining seats are allocated to the parties with the largest remainders.\nThe largest remainder method was first proposed by Alexander Hamilton in 1792 and it was used as a rule of distributing seats in the U.S. House of Representatives between 1852 and 1900 [e.g., Pukelsheim, 2014]. Currently, it is used for parliamentary elections in Russia, Ukraine, Tunisia, Namibia and Hong Kong.\nExample 2. Consider again the instance in Example 1. According to the largest remainder method, in the first step, party P1 is allocated \u230a 6\u00b710 100 \u230b = 0 seats, P2 gets \u230a 7\u00b710 100 \u230b = 0 seats, P3 gets \u230a 39\u00b710 100 \u230b = 3 seats, and P4 gets \u230a48\u00b710100 \u230b = 4 seats. There are three more seats to be distributed among the parties. The three highest fractional parts are 910 for party P3, 8 10 for party P4 and 7 10 for party P2, thus these three parties are allocated one additional seat each. The resulting seat allocation is (0, 1, 4, 5)."}, {"heading": "2.1.3 Properties of Apportionment Methods", "text": "The literature on fair representation has identified a number of desirable properties of apportionment methods [Balinski and Young, 1982, Pukelsheim, 2014]. In this paper, we focus on properties requiring that the proportion of seats in the resulting apportionment should reflect, as close as possible, the proportion of the votes cast for respective parties.\nDefinition 5. An apportionment method respects lower quota if, for every instance (v, h), each party Pi gets at least \u230a\nvih v+ \u230b seats. An apportionment method respects quota if each party Pi gets\neither \u230avih v+ \u230b or \u2308vih v+ \u2309 seats.\nClearly, any apportionment method respecting quota also respects lower quota. It is well known that the largest remainder method respects quota, but no divisor method does. Moreover, the D\u2019Hondt method is the only divisor method respecting lower quota [Balinski and Young, 1982]."}, {"heading": "2.2 Approval-Based Multiwinner Election Rules", "text": "We now introduce the setting of approval-based multiwinner elections.

Every element of R(A, k) is referred to as a winning committee."}, {"heading": "2.2.1 OWA-Based Rules", "text": "A remarkably general class of multiwinner election rules is defined via ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators [Thiele, 1895, Yager, 1988, Skowron et al., 2015]. A weight sequence is an infinite sequence of real numbers w = (w1, w2, . . .).4\nDefinition 6 (OWA-based rules). Consider a weight sequence w, a committee S \u2286 C , and a voter i \u2208 N . The satisfaction of i from S given w is defined as uwi (S) = \u2211|Ai\u2229S| j=1 wj . Given an instance (A, k) of the multiwinner election problem, the w-based OWA rule selects all size-k committees S that maximize the total satisfaction \u2211\ni\u2208N u w i (S).\nNote that multiplying a weight sequence w by a positive constant does not change the way in which a rule operates. Several established multiwinner election rules can be described as OWAbased rules.\nDefinition 7. The Chamberlin\u2013Courant rule is the OWA-based rule with weight sequence wCC = (1, 0, 0, . . .).\nThe Chamberlin\u2013Courant rule is usually defined in the context of multiwinner elections where voter preferences are given by ranked ballots, and each voter derives satisfaction only from their most preferred member of the committee [Chamberlin and Courant, 1983]. Our definition of the rule is a straightforward adaption to the approval setting: a voter is satisfied with a committee if and only if it contains at least one candidate that the voter approves of.\nDefinition 8. Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) is the OWA-based rule with weight sequence wPAV = (1, 1 2 , 1 3 , . . .).\nThough sometimes attributed to Forest Simmons, PAV was already proposed and discussed by the Danish polymath Thorvald N. Thiele in the 19th century [Thiele, 1895].5 According to PAV, each voter cares about the whole committee, but the marginal gain of satisfaction of an already satisfied voter from an additional approved committee member is lower than the gain of a less satisfied voter. The reason for using the particular weight sequence wPAV is not obvious. Aziz et al. [2015] and Sa\u0301nchez-Ferna\u0301ndez et al. [2016] provide compelling arguments by showing that wPAV is\n3In order to accommodate tied outcomes, multiple committees might be winning. 4Originally, OWA-based rules have been defined for a fixed committee size k, by a vector of k weights rather than by an infinite sequence. Since our focus is on multiwinner election rules that operate on arbitrary committee sizes, we need some way of grouping OWA-based rules for different values of k into a single OWA-based rule that works for arbitrary values of the committee size. We assume that the weight vector for the committee size k is built by appending a weight to the vector for the committee size (k \u2212 1). Thus, a single OWA-based rule can be represented by an infinite weight sequence. Another approach would be to represent an OWA-based rule by the collection of vectors of weights (one vector for each possible size of the committee).\n5We are grateful to Xavier Mora and Svante Janson for pointing this out to us.\nthe unique weight sequence w such that the w-based OWA rule satisfies certain axiomatic properties. Theorem 2 in the present paper can be viewed as an additional\u2014though related\u2014argument in favor of the weight sequence wPAV.\nDefinition 9. The top-k rule is the OWA-based rule with weight sequence wtop-k = (1, 1, 1, . . .).\nAccording to the top-k rule, the winning committee contains the k candidates that have been approved by the greatest number of voters.\nThe following example illustrates the OWA-based rules defined above.\nExample 3. Let k = 3 and consider the following preference profile with 12 voters:\nA1 = {c1} A5 = {c1, c4, c5, c6} A9 = {c2}\nA2 = {c1, c3, c5} A6 = {c1, c4, c5, c6} A10 = {c3, c5}\nA3 = {c1, c5, c6} A7 = {c1, c4} A11 = {c3}\nA4 = {c1, c5, c6} A8 = {c2, c4, c6} A12 = {c3}\nAccording to the Chamberlin\u2013Courant rule, the committee {c1, c2, c3} is the unique winner in this profile. Indeed, for this committee each voter approves of at least one committee member (voters 1\u20137 approve of c1, voters 8 and 9 approve of c2, and voters 10\u201312 approve of c3), thus each voter gets satisfaction equal to 1 from this committee. Clearly, this is the highest satisfaction that the voters can get from a committee. The reader might check that {c1, c2, c3} is the only committee for which each voter has at least one approved representative.\nAccording to Proportional Approval Voting, {c1, c3, c6} is the unique winner. Let us now compute the PAV satisfaction of voters from this committee. Voters 1, 7, 8, 10\u201312 approve of a single committee member, thus the satisfaction of these voters is equal to 1. Voter 9 does not approve any committee member, thus her satisfaction is equal to 0. The remaining 5 candidates approve of two committee members, so their satisfaction from a committee is equal to 1 + 12 . Thus, the total satisfaction of the voters from {c1, c3, c6} is equal to 6+5 \u00b7 32 = 13.5 and it can be checked that the satisfaction of voters from each other committee is lower.\nThe top-k rule, on the other hand, selects committee {c1, c5, c6} as the unique winner. Indeed, c1, c5 and c6 are approved by 7, 6, and 5 voters, respectively, and any other candidate is approved by less than 5 voters.\nOther appealing OWA-based rules include the t-best OWA rule, which is defined by the weight sequence w = (1, . . . , 1, 0, 0 . . .) with t ones followed by zeros, and the t-median OWA rule, which is defined by the weight sequence w = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, 0, . . .), where the 1 appears at position t [Skowron et al., 2015]."}, {"heading": "2.2.2 Sequential OWA-Based Rules", "text": "Another interesting class of multiwinner election systems consists of sequential (or iterative) variants of OWA-based rules.\nDefinition 10. The sequential w-based OWA rule selects all committees that can result from the following procedure. Starting with the empty committee (S = \u2205), in k consecutive steps add to the committee S a candidate c that maximizes \u2211\ni\u2208N ui(S \u222a {c}) \u2212 ui(S).\nJust like OWA-based rules, sequential OWA-based rules have already been considered by Thiele [1895]. Sequential Proportional Approval Voting (referred to as \u201creweighted approval voting\u201d by Aziz et al. [2015]) was used for a short period in Sweden during the early 1900s [Janson, 2016].\nInterestingly, a sequential OWA-based rule approximates the original rule whenever the weight sequence w is non-increasing [Skowron et al., 2015]. Sequential OWA-based rules are appealing alternatives to their original equivalents for a number of reasons. First, they are computationally tractable, while finding winners for the original OWA-based rules is often NP-hard. Second, the sequential rules often exhibit properties which the original rules do not have; for instance, they (trivially) satisfy committee monotonicity while some of the original versions do not [see, e.g., Elkind et al., 2014]. Third, sequential methods are easier to describe to non-experts, as compared to rules formulated as non-trivial combinatorial optimization problems.\nExample 4. Consider the instance from Example 3. Sequential Proportional Approval Voting selects candidate c1 in the first iteration. In order to decide which candidate is selected in the second iteration, one must compare all remaining candidates with respect to their contribution to the total satisfaction of the voters. For instance, by selecting c3 the satisfaction of voters will increase by 1 2 +3. One can check that there are two optimal choices in the second step: selecting c3 or selecting c5. If c3 is selected in the second step, then our procedure will select c6 in the third step (selecting c6 increases the satisfaction of voters by 1 + 4 \u00b7 12 ). If c5 is selected in the second step, then c3 must be chosen in the third step (by choosing c3 we increase the satisfaction of voters by 13 + 5 \u00b7 1 2 ). Consequently, there are two winning committees according to Sequential Proportional Approval Voting: {c1, c3, c5} and {c1, c3, c6}."}, {"heading": "2.2.3 Monroe\u2019s Rule", "text": "The optimization problem underlying the Chamberlin\u2013Courant rule can be thought of in terms of maximizing representation: every voter is assigned to a single candidate in the committee and this \u201crepresentative\u201d completely determines the satisfaction that the voter derives from the committee. The rule proposed by Monroe [1995] is based on the same idea; However, Monroe requires each candidate to represent the same number of voters. For the sake of simplicity, when considering the Monroe rule we assume that the number of voters n is divisible by the size of the committee k.\nDefinition 11. Assume that k divides n and consider a size-k committee S. A balanced allocation of the voters to the candidates S is a function \u03c4S : N \u2192 S such that |\u03c4 \u22121 S (c)| = n k\nfor all c \u2208 S. The satisfaction ui(\u03c4S) of a voter i from \u03c4S is equal to one if i approves of \u03c4S(i), and zero otherwise. The total satisfaction of voters provided by S, denoted u(S), is defined as the satisfaction from the best balanced allocation, i.e., u(S) = max\u03c4S \u2211\ni\u2208N ui(\u03c4S). The Monroe rule selects all committees S maximizing u(S).\nExample 5. Consider the instance from Example 3 and consider committee {c1, c2, c3}, which is a winning committee under the Chamberlin\u2013Courant rule. Even though every voter has an approved\ncommittee member (voters 1\u20137 approve of c1, voters 8 and 9 approve of c2, and voters 10\u201312 approve of c3), this committee has a total satisfaction of 10 only.

Here, we formulate two particularly interesting variants [see Brill et al., 2017].\nThe motivation behind Phragme\u0301n\u2019s rules is to find a committee whose \u201csupport\u201d is distributed as evenly as possible among the electorate. For every candidate in the committee, one unit of \u201cload\u201d needs to be distributed among the voters approving this candidate.

For a given instance (v, h) of the apportionment problem, this procedure involves three steps:\n1. Translate (v, h) into an instance (A, k) of the multiwinner problem.\n2. Apply the multiwinner rule R to (A, k).\n3. Translate committee(s) in R(A, k) into seat distribution(s) for (v, h).\nWe now describe each step in detail.\nStep 1. Given an instance (v, h) of the apportionment problem, we construct an instance (A, k) of the multiwinner problem as follows. For each i \u2208 [p], we introduce a set Ci consisting of h candidates, and a set Ni consisting of vi voters. Each voter in Ni approves of all candidates in Ci (and of no other candidates). Furthermore, we define C =\n\u22c3p i=1Ci, N = \u22c3p i=1 Ni, and k = h.\nIntuitively, Ci is the set of members of party Pi and Ni is the set of voters who voted for party Pi.\nStep 2. We can now apply multiwinner rule R to (A, k) in order to find the set R(A, k) of winning committees.\nStep 3. For every winning committee S \u2208 R(A, k), we can extract a seat distribution x for the instance (v, h) in the following way: the number xi of seats of a party Pi is given by the number of candidates from Ci in the committee S, i.e., xi = |Ci \u2229 S|.\nThe next example illustrates this three-step procedure.\nExample 7 (Sequential PAV as an apportionment method). Consider the instance (v, h) = ((20, 40, 30, 10), 10) of the apportionment problem. We construct an instance of the multiwinner election setting with 40 candidates; each party Pi has a set Ci consisting of 10 candidates. Further, there are\n\u22114 i=1 vi = 100 voters: 20 voters approve the ten candidates in C1, 40 voters approve\nthe ten candidates in C2, 30 voters the ten candidates in C3, and 10 voters the ten candidates in C4. The Sequential PAV method selects the winning committee by selecting in 10 consecutive steps candidates from C2, C3, C1, C2, C3, C2, C1, C2, C3, C4. Thus, the corresponding seat allocation is (x1, x2, x3, x4) = (2, 4, 3, 1).\nFor a given multiwinner rule R, we let MR denote the apportionment method defined by steps 1 to 3. We say that a multiwinner election rule R satisfies (lower) quota if the corresponding apportionment method MR satisfies the respective property."}, {"heading": "3.1 OWA-Based Apportionment Methods", "text": "In this section, we consider apportionment methods induced by OWA-based rules. Fix a weight sequence w and let R denote the w-based OWA rule. For every instance (v, h) of the apportionment setting, MR(v, h) contains all seat distributions x maximizing the total voter satisfaction u(x), which is given by\nu(x) = \u2211\ni\u2208[p] viu\nw i (x) =\n\u2211 i\u2208[p] vi\n\n\nxi \u2211\nj=1\nwj\n\n . (1)\nHere, uwi (x) = \u2211xi\nj=1wj denotes the satisfaction of a voter from party Pi. We let u\u0302(i, s) denote the marginal increase in u(\u00b7) when assigning the s-th seat to party Pi. Due to (1), we have u\u0302(i, s) = viws. Taking away a seat from party Pi and giving it to party Pj results in a change of total voter satisfaction of\nu(xiyj)\u2212 u(x) = u\u0302(j, xj + 1)\u2212 u\u0302(i, xi) = vjwxj+1 \u2212 viwxi .\nOptimality of x \u2208 MR(v, h) implies that u(xiyj)\u2212 u(x) \u2264 0 for all i, j \u2208 [p] with xi > 0.\nWhenever the weight vector w is non-increasing, the w-based OWA rule induces the same apportionment method as its sequential variant.6\n6OWA-based rules with non-increasing weight sequences are very natural, especially when viewed in the context of apportionment. OWA-based rules with increasing sequences induce apportionment methods that allocate all seats to the single party that receives the most votes. The same seat distribution can be also obtained by using the OWA-based rule with a constant weight vector (see Proposition 5).\nProposition 1. Let w be a weight sequence with wj \u2265 wj+1 \u2265 0 for all j \u2208 N. The apportionment method induced by the w-based OWA rule coincides with the apportionment method induced by the sequential w-based OWA rule.\nProof. Fix a weight sequence w = (w1, w2, . . .) satisfying wj \u2265 wj+1 \u2265 0 for all j \u2208 N. Let R be the w-based OWA rule and let R\u2032 be the sequential w-based OWA rule. We show that the apportionment methods induced by R and R\u2032 coincide, i.e., MR\u2032 = MR.\nConsider an instance (v, h) of the apportionment setting. Then MR(v, h) contains all seat distributions x maximizing the total voter satisfaction u(x), which is given by (1).\nNow consider the apportionment method MR\u2032 based on the sequential w-based OWA rule. This method starts with the empty seat allocation x(0) = (0, . . . , 0) and iteratively assigns a seat to a party Pi such that the marginal increase in total voter satisfaction is maximized. Recall that u\u0302(i, s) denotes the marginal increase in u(\u00b7) when assigning the s-th seat to party Pi. Due to (1), this quantity is independent of xj for j 6= i and equals u\u0302(i, s) = viws. For \u2113 = 1, . . . , h, method MR\u2032 iteratively chooses a party Pi\u2217 with i\u2217 \u2208 argmaxi\u2208[p] u\u0302(i, x (\u2113\u22121) i ) and sets x (\u2113) = (x (\u2113) 1 , . . . , x (\u2113) i\u2217 + 1, . . . , x (\u2113) p ).\nFor every seat allocation x, the total voter satisfaction u(x) can be written as u(x) = \u2211\ni\u2208[p] \u2211xi\ns=1 u\u0302(i, s). In particular, u(x) is independent of the order in which seats are allocated to parties. Furthermore, our assumption w1 \u2265 w2 \u2265 . . . implies that the marginal satisfaction u\u0302(i, s) is monotonically decreasing in s for every party Pi. Therefore, any seat distribution maximizing u(\u00b7) (i.e., any x \u2208 MR(v, h)) can be iteratively constructed by applying method MR\u2032 .\nAn immediate corollary is that OWA-based rules with a monotonically decreasing weight sequence can be computed efficiently in the apportionment setting.\nFurther, we can use Proposition 1 to show that every OWA-based rule with a non-increasing weight sequence induces a divisor method. For a weight sequence w = (w1, w2, . . .), let dw = (dw(0), dw(1), . . .) be the sequence defined by dw(s) = 1ws+1 for all s \u2208 N0. For example, wPAV = (1, 12 , 1 3 , . . .) yields dwPAV = (1, 2, 3, . . .).\nTheorem 1. Let w be a weight sequence with wj \u2265 wj+1 > 0 for all j \u2208 N. The apportionment method induced by the w-based OWA rule coincides with the divisor method based on dw = (\n1 w1 , 1 w2 , 1 w3 , . . .).\nProof. Fix a weight sequence w with wj \u2265 wj+1 > 0 for all j \u2208 N. Let R(w) denote the w-based OWA rule, and let R\u2032(w) denote the sequential w-based OWA rule. It follows from Proposition 1 that MR(w) coincides with MR\u2032(w). Let furthermore M(dw) denote the divisor method based on dw. We are going to show that MR\u2032(w) coincides with M(dw).\nBoth M(dw) and MR\u2032(w) work iteratively. At each iteration, M(dw) assigns a seat to a party Pi maximizing vi\ndw(si) , where vi is the number of votes for party Pi and si is the number of seats\nallocated to party Pi in previous iterations. Method MR\u2032(w), on the other hand, assigns a seat to a party maximizing the marginal increase in total voter satisfaction. The marginal increase in total voter satisfaction when giving an additional seat to party Pi equals u\u0302(i, si + 1) = viwsi+1.\nUsing dw(s) = 1ws+1 , we can observe that the quantities ( vi dw(si) )i\u2208[p] used in divisor method M(dw) exactly coincide with the quantities (viwsi+1)i\u2208[p] used in the method MR\u2032(w). Thus, both methods assign seats in exactly the same way."}, {"heading": "3.2 Proportional Approval Voting as an Extension of the D\u2019Hondt Method", "text": "A particularly interesting consequence of Theorem 1 is that Proportional Approval Voting, the OWA rule with wPAV = (1, 12 , 1 3 , . . .), induces the D\u2019Hondt method.\nCorollary 2. The apportionment method induced by PAV coincides with the D\u2019Hondt method.\nThe observation that PAV reduces to the D\u2019Hondt method in the party-list setting occasionally occurs (without proof) in the literature [e.g., see Pereira, 2016].7 Theorem 1 shows that this is just one special case of the general relationship between OWA-based multiwinner rules and divisor methods.\nSince the D\u2019Hondt method satisfies lower quota, the same holds for PAV (and Sequential PAV) in the apportionment setting.\nCorollary 3. PAV and Sequential PAV satisfy lower quota.\nThe fact that PAV satisfies lower quota can also be established by observing that every multiwinner rule satisfying extended justified representation [Aziz et al., 2015] or proportional justified representation [Sa\u0301nchez-Ferna\u0301ndez et al., 2016] also satisfies lower quota. See Appendix A for details.\nFurther, we show that PAV is the only OWA-based rule satisfying lower quota.8\nTheorem 2. PAV is the only OWA-based rule satisfying lower quota.\nProof. Let R be an OWA-based rule such that MR satisfies lower quota. We will show that R is based on a weight sequence w with wj = w1 j\nfor all j \u2208 N, from which we will infer that MR is equivalent to PAV.\nFix j \u2208 N. We will show wj = w1 j in two steps.\nStep 1. Given a natural number Z > 1, we define an instance (v, h) of the apportionment problem as follows. There are Z+1 parties and the vote distribution is given by v = (Z, jZ\u22121, . . . , jZ\u22121). That is, party P1 gets Z votes and all other parties get jZ\u2212 1 votes. Thus, the total number of votes is v+ = Z + Z(jZ \u2212 1) = jZ2. Furthermore, we set h = v+ Z\n= jZ . Consider a seat allocation x \u2208 MR(v, h). Since MR satisfies lower quota, we have x1 \u2265\n\u230a\nZ\u00b7jZ Z2j\n\u230b = 1 and x\u2113 \u2265 \u230a (jZ\u22121)\u00b7jZ Z2j \u230b = \u230a (jZ\u22121) z \u230b = j \u2212 1 for all \u2113 6= 1. Thus, P1 is allocated at\nleast one seat, and each of the other Z parties is allocated at least j \u2212 1 seats. From the pigeonhole\n7In fact, already Thiele [1895] stated this equivalence, but only in the special case when perfect proportionality is possible; see the survey by Janson [2016].\n8This result also follows from Theorem 1 together with the characterization of the D\u2019Hondt method as the only divisor method satisfying lower quota [Balinski and Young, 1982, Proposition 6.4]. We give a direct proof for completeness.\nprinciple we infer that at least one of the parties P2, . . . , PZ+1 gets exactly j \u2212 1 seats. Let P\u2113 be such a party and consider the seat allocation x1y\u2113. Since x maximizes u(\u00b7), we have\n0 \u2265 u(x1y\u2113)\u2212 u(x) = u\u0302(\u2113, j) \u2212 u\u0302(1, 1) = (jZ \u2212 1)wj \u2212 zw1.\nIt follows that wj \u2264 w1 j \u00b7 Z Z\u22121 . Since this inequality has to hold for all natural numbers Z > 1, we infer that wj \u2264 w1 j .\nStep 2. Next, we construct another instance (v\u2032, h\u2032) of the apportionment problem, again parameterized by a natural number Z > 1. There are Z + 1 parties and the vote distribution is v\u2032 is given by v\u2032 = (jZ,Z \u2212 1, . . . , Z \u2212 1). Thus, v\u2032+ = Z 2 \u2212 Z + jZ . The number of seats is given by h\u2032 = v\u2032+ Z\n= Z + j \u2212 1. Consider a seat allocation x \u2208 MR(v\u2032, h\u2032). Since MR satisfies lower quota, we infer that\nx1 \u2265 \u230a jZ(Z+j\u22121) Z(Z+j\u22121) \u230b\n= j. The pigeonhole principle implies that at least one of parties P2, . . . , PZ+1 gets no seat. Let P\u2113 be such a party and consider x1y\u2113. We have\n0 \u2265 u(x1y\u2113)\u2212 u(x) = u\u0302(\u2113, 1) \u2212 u\u0302(1, j) = (Z \u2212 1)w1 \u2212 jZ \u00b7 wj ,\nand thus wj \u2265 w1 j \u00b7 Z\u22121 Z . Again, this inequality holds for all Z , and thus wj \u2265 w1 j .\nWe have therefore shown that wj = w1 j for all j \u2208 N. It follows that w = c \u00b7 wPAV for some constant c > 0. As a consequence, R is equivalent to PAV.\nTheorem 2 characterizes PAV as the only OWA-based rule respecting lower quota. Since PAV does not respect (exact) quota, it follows that no OWA-based rule respects quota. Due to Proposition 1, the same is true for sequential OWA-based rules.\nThe load-balancing rule max-Phragme\u0301n also induces the D\u2019Hondt method. Indeed, Phragme\u0301n formulated his rule as a generalization of the D\u2019Hondt method to the general (\u201copen list\u201d) case (see Janson, 2016).\nTheorem 3. The apportionment method induced by max-Phragme\u0301n coincides with the D\u2019Hondt method.\nProof. In the apportionment setting, optimal load distributions have a very simple structure. Given a seat distribution x, it is clearly optimal to distribute the load of xi (1 for each seat that is allocated to party Pi) uniformly among the vi voters of the party. Therefore, the maximal voter load for x is given by maxi\u2208[p]\nxi vi . Balinski and Young have shown that the D\u2019Hondt method selects seat distributions minimizing this quantity [Balinski and Young, 1982, Proposition 3.10].\nWe note that Phragme\u0301n also proposed a sequential rule based on load distributions. It is straightforward to verify that, in the apportionment setting, this variant coincides with max-Phragme\u0301n and thus also induces the D\u2019Hondt method."}, {"heading": "3.3 Monroe\u2019s Rule as an Extension of the Largest Remainder Method", "text": "We now turn to Monroe\u2019s multiwinner rule. It turns out that it induces the largest remainder method.\nTheorem 4. Assume that the number of seats divides the total number of voters. Then, Monroe\u2019s rule induces the largest remainder method.\nProof. Let R denote Monroe\u2019s rule. Recall that Monroe\u2019s rule assigns voters to candidates in a balanced way, so as to maximize the total voter satisfaction. In the apportionment setting, a voter in Ni is satisfied if and only if she is assigned to a candidate in Ci. The apportionment method MR selects seat distributions maximizing the total voter satisfaction.\nFor a seat allocation x, let u(x) denote the total voter satisfaction provided by x. We can write u(x) = \u2211\ni\u2208[p] u(i, x), where u(i, x) is the total satisfaction that voters in Ni derive from x. For a given instance (v, h) of the apportionment problem, u(i, x) can be expressed as\nu(i, x) =\n{\nvi if xi \u2265 vi hv+ , xi v+ h if xi < vi hv+ .\nSince the case u(i, x) = vi occurs if and only if vi \u2264 xi v+ h , we have u(i, x) = min(vi, xi v+ h ) and\nu(x) = \u2211\ni\u2208[p] u(i, x) =\n\u2211 i\u2208[p] min\n( vi, xi v+ h ) . (2)\nWe show that MR coincides with the largest remainder method for all instances (v, h) such that v+ divides h. Fix such an instance (v, h) and let x \u2208 MR(v, h). The proof consists of three steps.\nStep 1. We first show that xi \u2265 \u230avihv+ \u230b for all parties Pi. Assume for contradiction that this is not the case and let Pi be a party with xi < \u230a vih v+ \u230b. We infer that xi \u2264 vih v+ \u2212 1 and, by the pigeonhole principle, that there exists a party Pj such that xj > vjh\nv+ . Thus, u(i, x) = xi v+ h\nand u(j, x) = vj . Therefore,\nu(xjyi)\u2212 u(x) = u(i, xjyi) + u(j, xjyi)\u2212 u(i, x) \u2212 u(j, x)\n= (xi + 1) v+ h +min ( vj, (xj \u2212 1) v+ h ) \u2212 vj \u2212 xi v+ h = v+ h +min ( vj , (xj \u2212 1) v+ h ) \u2212 vj \u2265 v+ h > 0,\ncontradicting our assumption that x \u2208 MR(v, h).\nStep 2. We next show that xi \u2264 \u230avihv+ \u230b for all parties Pi. Assume for contradiction that this is not the case and let Pi be a party with xi > \u2308 vih v+ \u2309. Similarly as before, we infer that xi \u2265 vih v+ + 1 and that there exists a party Pj with xj < vjh\nv+ . Thus, u(i, x) = vi and u(j, x) = xj v+ h . Therefore,\nu(xiyj)\u2212 u(x) = u(i, xiyj) + u(j, xiyj)\u2212 u(i, x) \u2212 u(j, x)\n= vi +min ( vj , (xj + 1) v+ h ) \u2212 vi \u2212 xj v+ h = min (\nvj, (xj + 1) v+ h ) \u2212 xj v+ h \u2265 v+ h > 0.\nAs in step 1, we have reached a contradiction.\nStep 3. In the first two steps, we have shown that \u230av\u2113h v+ \u230b \u2264 x\u2113 \u2264 \u2308 v\u2113h v+ \u2309 for each party P\u2113. Now we show that MR coincides with the largest remainder method. For the sake of contradiction, assume that this is not the case. Then, there exist two parties Pi and Pj such that xi >\nvih v+ , xj < vjh v+ , but\nvih v+ \u2212 (xi \u2212 1) < vjh v+ \u2212 xj . (3)\nTherefore,\nu(xiyj)\u2212 u(x) = u(i, xiyj) + u(j, xiyj)\u2212 u(i, x)\u2212 u(j, x)\n= (xi \u2212 1) v+ h + vj \u2212 vi \u2212 xj v+ h = v+ h ( vjh v+ \u2212 xj \u2212 vih v+ + xi \u2212 1 ) > 0,\nwhere the inequality is due to (3).

In particular, if there are more parties than seats, then all committees are winning."}, {"heading": "4 Degressive Proportionality and Election Thresholds", "text": "In this section, we show that OWA-based multiwinner rules can also be used to induce apportionment methods with appealing properties other than lower quota. We do this by exploring degressive proportionality, the concept suggesting that smaller populations should be allocated more representatives in comparison to the quota-based allocation methods, and election thresholds, the concept saying that a party should only be represented in parliament if it receives at least a certain fraction of votes. To the best of our knowledge, the OWA-based rules considered in this section have not been studied before."}, {"heading": "4.1 Degressive Proportionality", "text": "Despite its mathematical elegance and apparent simplicity, the proportionality principle is not always desirable. For instance, in an assembly where decisions are taken under simple majority rule, a cohesive group of 51% has obviously more than a \u201cfair\u201d share. Principles of justice indicate that, for decisions bodies governed by majority rule, fair apportionment should follow a norm of degressive proportionality [Laslier, 2012, Koriyama et al., 2013]. In fact, degressive proportional apportionments can often be observed in parliaments that gather districts, regions, or states of very different sizes, such as the European Parliament.11 We now provide two examples, both of which are OWA-based.\nThe Penrose apportionment method (aka square-root method and devised by Penrose [1946]; see also the work of Slomczynski and Z\u0307yczkowski [2006]) allocates seats in such a way that the number of seats allocated to a party is proportional to the square root of the votes for that party. It has been proposed for the United Nations Parliamentary Assembly [International Network for a UN Second Assembly, 1987] and for allocating voting weights12 in the Council of the European Union [BBC News, 2004]. Let us say that an apportionment method M satisfies the Penrose condition if, for every instance (v, h) and for every x \u2208 M(v, h), it holds that xi \u2265 \u230ah \u221a vi\u2211\n\u2113\n\u221a v\u2113 \u230b for all i \u2208 [p]. Interestingly,\nthe Penrose condition can be satisfied by using an OWA-based rule. The weight sequence w = (w1, w2, . . .) achieving this is given by wj = 1j2 for all j \u2208 N.\nTheorem 6. The apportionment method induced by the OWA-based rule with weight sequence w = (1, 1/4, 1/9, . . .) satisfies the Penrose condition.\nProof. Let R be the w-based OWA rule with wj = 1j2 for all j \u2208 N. We show that MR satisfies the Penrose condition. Assume for contradiction that for some instance (v, h) of the apportionment\n11Even though the composition of the European Parliament is not the result of the application of a well-defined rule, it is interesting to note that the history of successive negotiations produced such a result [see Rose, 2013].\n12The question of allocating voting weights to representatives is formally equivalent to the apportionment problem.\nproblem, there is a seat distribution x \u2208 MR(v, h) with xi < \u230ah \u221a vi\u2211\n\u2113\n\u221a v\u2113 \u230b for some i \u2208 [p]. We infer\nthat xi \u2264 h \u221a vi\u2211\n\u2113\n\u221a v\u2113 \u2212 1, and, using the pigeonhole principle, that there exists a party Pj such that\nxj > h \u221a vj\u2211\n\u2113\n\u221a v\u2113 . We conclude that xi+1\u221a vi < xj\u221a vj , and thus vi (xi+1)2 > vj x2j . Therefore,\nu(xjyi)\u2212 u(x) = u\u0302(i, xi + 1)\u2212 u\u0302(j, xj) = vi\n(xi + 1)2 \u2212 vj x2j > 0,\ncontradicting the assumption that x \u2208 MR(v, h). This completes the proof.\nDegressive proportionality is also an important feature of the so-called Cambridge Compromise, which proposes an apportionment method for the European Parliament based on an affine formula: each member state should be endowed with a fixed number (5) of delegates plus a variable number, proportional to the population of the state [Grimmett et al., 2011].\nWe show that such an apportionment method can be implemented via an OWA-based multiwinner rule.\nProposition 6. Consider an instance (v, h) of the apportionment setting with h \u2265 5p and let Z be a constant with Z > 5v+. Let R denote the w-based OWA rule with weight sequence w = (0, 0, 0, 0, Z, 1, 1/2, 1/3, . . .). Then, for every x \u2208 MR(v, h) and for every i \u2208 [p],\nxi \u2265 5 and xi \u2212 5 \u2265\n\u230a\nvi(h\u2212 5p)\nv+\n\u230b\n.\nProof. We first prove that each party gets at least five seats. Indeed, for the sake of contradiction let us assume that party Pi gets less than five seats. By transferring some votes from other parties (having more than five representatives) to Pi we increase the satisfaction of supporters of Pi by at least viZ > 5v+. At the same time, transferring a seat from some party Pj (having more than five seats) to Pi reduces the satisfaction of the supporters of Pj by at most v+. Thus, such a transfer of at most five seats improves the total satisfaction of the voters, a contradiction.\nWe now show that xi \u2212 5 \u2265 \u230a vi(h\u22125p)\nv+ \u230b for all x \u2208 MR(v, h) and for all i \u2208 [p]. For the sake\nof contradiction, assume that there is an instance (v, h) of the apportionment problem and a seat distribution x \u2208 MR(v, h) with xi \u2212 5 < \u230a\nvi(h\u22125p) v+ \u230b for some i \u2208 [p]. Thus, xi \u2212 5 \u2264 vi(h\u22125p) v+ \u2212 1,\nand, by the pigeonhole principle, there exists a party Pj such that xj \u2212 5 > vj(h\u22125p)\nv+ . Consequently,\nxi\u22124 vi < xj\u22125 vj , and thus vi xi\u22124 > vj xj\u22125 . Therefore,\nu(xjyi)\u2212 u(x) = u\u0302(i, xi + 1)\u2212 u\u0302(j, xj) = vi\nxi \u2212 5 + 1 \u2212 vj xj \u2212 5 > 0,\ncontradicting the assumption that x \u2208 MR(v, h). This completes the proof."}, {"heading": "4.2 Election Thresholds", "text": "OWA-based multiwinner rules also provide an interesting way for implementing election thresholds. Thresholds in the form of percentage hurdles are often encountered in parliamentary elections [see\nPukelsheim, 2014, Section 7.6]. For a weight sequence w = (w1, w2, . . .), let w[t] be the weight sequence obtained from w by replacing the first t elements of w with zeros. The w[t]-based OWA rule induces an apportionment method that allocates seats to a party only if the number of votes the party receives exceeds a certain fraction of the total number of votes received by parties with allocated seats.13 Proposition 7 formalizes this behavior for the weight sequence wPAV.\nProposition 7. Consider an instance (v, h) of the apportionment problem and fix an integer t with 1 \u2264 t < h. Let R denote the OWA-based rule with weight sequence wPAV[t]. Then, for all seat distributions x \u2208 MR(v, h),\nxi > 0 only if vi \u2211\n\u2113\u2208[p]:x\u2113>0 v\u2113 >\nt h .\nProof. Consider a seat distribution x \u2208 MR(v, h). First, observe that there is at least one party that is allocated strictly more than t seats. (Otherwise, the total voter satisfaction u(x) would be zero and could be improved upon by giving all seats to an arbitrary party.) Without loss of generality let us assume that party P1 is such a party, i.e., x1 > t.\nSecond, observe that every party that is allocated some seat under x, is allocated strictly more than t seats. In other word, x\u2113 > 0 implies x\u2113 > t. (Otherwise, the total voter satisfaction provided by x could be improved upon by x\u2113y1.)\nNow consider a party Pi with xi > 0. The argument above implies that xi > t. Let vx+ denote the total number of votes for parties with allocated seats under x, i.e., vx+ = \u2211\n\u2113\u2208[p]:x\u2113>0 v\u2113. If vi xi \u2265 vx+ h , then vi vx + \u2265 xi h > t h and we are done. So let us assume that vi xi < vx+ h . From the pigeonhole principle we infer that there exists a party Pj with xj > 0 such that vj xj \u2265 vx+ h\n. Since xj > 0, the observation above implies that xj > t. Therefore,\n0 \u2265 u(xiyj)\u2212 u(x) = u\u0302(j, xj + 1)\u2212 u\u0302(i, xi) = vj\nxj + 1 \u2212 vi xi\nand thus\nvi \u2265 xi vj\nxj + 1 = xi vj xj \u00b7 xj xj + 1 > xi vj xj \u00b7 t t+ 1 \u2265 t vj xj \u2265 t vx+ h .\nThis completes the proof.\nAn interesting open question is whether it is possible to naturally modify the definition of the Monroe system to implement election thresholds.\n13 The thresholds implemented by OWA-based apportionment methods differ from real-world election thresholds in one important aspect: Rather than requiring a certain fraction (say, 5%) of all votes, the thresholds we consider here require a certain fraction of those votes that are received by parties with allocated seats. An advantage of the latter kind of threshold requirement is that it can always be satisfied. By contrast, requiring a certain fraction of all votes can lead to situations in which no party reaches the required number of votes and, therefore, no seat allocation satisfies the threshold requirement."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In legislative procedures, proportional representation is typically achieved by employing party-list apportionment methods such as the D\u2019Hondt method or the largest remainder method. These methods impose proportionality by assuring that each party in a representative body is allocated a number of representatives that is proportional to the number of received votes.\nIn this paper we have proposed a simple and natural formal framework that allows us to view approval-based multiwinner election rules as apportionment methods. This framework has enabled us to establish correspondences between several multiwinner rules, such as PAV, the Monroe rule, the top-k rule, and the Chamberlin\u2013Courant rule, and the corresponding apportionment methods. These results give interesting insights into the nature of the analyzed multiwinner rules, and they show how traditional apportionment methods can be extended to settings where voters can vote for individual candidates.\nAcknowledgments We thank Bernard Grofman, Svante Janson, and Friedrich Pukelsheim for helpful discussions.

The following definition is due to Sa\u0301nchez-Ferna\u0301ndez et al. [2016].\nDefinition 14. Consider an instance (A, k) of the multiwinner election setting and a size-k committee S. The committee S provides proportional justified representation (PJR) for (C,A, k) if there does not exist a subset N\u2217 \u2286 N of voters and an integer \u2113 > 0 with |N\u2217| \u2265 \u2113n\nk such that\n| \u22c2 i\u2208N\u2217 Ai| \u2265 \u2113, but |S \u2229 ( \u22c3\ni\u2208N\u2217 Ai)| < \u2113. An approval-based voting rule R satisfies proportional justified representation (PJR) if for every instance (C,A, k), every committee in R(C,A, k) provides PJR for (C,A, k).\nProposition 8. If a multiwinner election rule satisfies proportional justified representation, then it satisfies lower quota.\nProof. Let R be a multiwinner election rule satisfying PJR, and consider an instance (v, h) of the apportionment problem. Consider an arbitrary party Pi with i \u2208 [p]. Translated to the multiwinner election setting, there is a group Ni of voters of size |Ni| = vi and every voter in Ni approves all h candidates in Ci. Define \u2113 = \u230a\nvih v+ \u230b. We have \u2113 \u2264 vih v+ and thus vi \u2265 \u2113 v+ h .\nLet N\u2217 = Ni. Since |N\u2217| = vi \u2265 \u2113 v+ h and | \u22c2\ni\u2208N\u2217 Ai| = |Ci| = h \u2265 \u2113, proportional justified representation implies that every committee S that is chosen by R satisfies |S \u2229 ( \u22c3\ni\u2208N\u2217 Ai)| \u2265 \u2113. And since S \u2229 ( \u22c3\ni\u2208N\u2217 Ai) = S \u2229 Ci, we know that xi = |S \u2229 Ci| \u2265 \u2113. Thus, party Pi is allocated at least \u2113 = \u230avih\nv+ \u230b seats, as desired.\nSince Proportional Approval Voting satisfies PJR\u2014and in fact even the stronger property extended justified representation [Aziz et al., 2015]\u2014it also satisfies lower quota."}], "references": [{"title": "Electoral strategies under open-list proportional representation", "author": ["B.
