One of the classical and fundamental payoff function for POMDPs is the discounted-sum payoff that aggregates the rewards of the transitions as a discounted sum. The traditional objective in POMDPs has been to obtain policies that maximize the expected discounted-sum payoff.\nOne crucial drawback of the traditional objective (that asks for expectation maximization) is that it allows for undesirable events that can happen with low probability. For example, consider a policy \u03c31 that with probability 1/2 achieves payoff 100 and with probability 1/2 achieves payoff 0, and a different policy \u03c32 that achieves payoff 20 with probability 1. If payoff values below 10 are undesirable, then the first policy, though better for expected payoff, allows undesirable events with significant probability, and hence the second policy is preferable. Hence, there has been a recent interest to study objectives where, instead of maximizing the expected payoff [HYV16], the goal is to maximize the probability that the payoff is above a threshold.\n\u2217Author supported by an F.R.S.-FNRS Aspirant fellowship.\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n08 69\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\nA drawback of the approach to maximize the probability that the payoff exceeds a threshold is that it ignores the optimization aspect of maximizing the expectation. In this work we consider an objective for POMDPs where both aspects are present. More precisely, we consider a \u201cguaranteed payoff optimization (GPO)\u201d problem for POMDPs, where given a threshold t, the goal is to maximize the expectation while ensuring that the payoff is at least t.\nAs a concrete motivation for the GPO problem, consider planning under uncertainty (e.g., self-driving cars) where certain events are catastrophic (e.g., crashes), and in the model they are assigned low payoffs. Such catastrophic events must be avoided even at the expense of expected payoff. That is, policies must maximize the expected payoff, ensuring the avoidance of catastrophic events. Hence, for planning in safety-critical applications the GPO problem is natural.\nIn this work, our main contributions are as follows: 1. We study the GPO problem for POMDPs, and present a practical solution approach for the problem.\nIn particular, given a POMDP with the GPO problem, we present a transformation to a different POMDP where it suffices to solve the traditional expectation objective. Our solution approach first constructs a representation of all strategies that satisfies item a) of the GPO problem, and then we extend the partially-observable Monte Carlo planning (POMCP) approach to obtain optimal policies w.r.t. expectation among the above strategies. 2. We present experimental results on several classical POMDP examples from the literature to show how our approach can efficiently solve the GPO problem for POMDPs.\nRelated Works. Works studying POMDPs with discounted sum range from theoretical results (see, e.g., [PT87, Lit96]) to practical tools (e.g. [KHL08, SV10]). Recent works focus on extracting policies which ensure that, with a given probability bound, the obtained discounted-sum payoff is above a threshold (see, e.g., [HYV16]). The problem of ensuring the payoff is above a given threshold while optimizing the expectation has been considered for fully-observable MDPs and the long-run average and stochastic shortest path objectives [BFRR14, RRS15]; and also with probabilistic thresholds for long-run average payoff [CKK15]. As for POMDPs, we mention constrained POMDPs [UH10, PMP+15], where the aim is to maximize the expected payoff while ensuring that the expectation of some other quantity is bounded. In contrast, our constraints are hard, i.e. they must hold always, not just on average. The work probably closest to ours is [STW16] that also considers maximizing expected payoff among all policies satisfying a given constraint, but there are two key differences from our work: they consider finite horizon POMDPs, while we consider infinite horizon ones, and more importantly, their constraints are state-based, i.e. their policy must ensure that the execution of the POMDP does not go through certain \u201cviolating\u201d states. In contrast, our \u201cthreshold constraint\u201d is execution-based : whether a execution yields payoff at least t cannot be determined solely by looking at the set of states appearing in the execution, but the whole infinite execution has to be considered. This requires very different techniques. To our best knowledge, the GPO problem has never been considered for POMDPs with discounted sum."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "Throughout this work, we follow standard (PO)MDP notations from [Put05, Lit96]."}, {"heading": "2.1 POMDPs", "text": "We denote by D(X) the set of all probability distributions on a finite set X, i.e. all functions f \u2236 X \u2192 [0,1] such that \u2211x\u2208X f(x) = 1. For f \u2208 D(X) we denote by Supp(f) the support of f , i.e. the set {x \u2208X \u2223 f(x) > 0}.\nDefinition 1. POMDPs. A POMDP is defined as a tuple P = (S,A, \u03b4, r,Z,O, \u03bb) where S is a finite set of states, A is a finite alphabet of actions, \u03b4 \u2236 S \u00d7A \u2192 D(S) is a probabilistic transition function that given a state s and an action a \u2208 A gives the probability distribution over the successor states, r \u2236 S \u00d7A \u2192 R is a reward function, Z is a finite set of observations, O \u2236 S \u2192 D(Z) is a probabilistic observation function that maps every state to a distribution over observations, and \u03bb \u2208 D(S) is the initial belief. We abbreviate \u03b4(s, a)(s\u2032) by \u03b4(s\u2032\u2223s, a),\nRemark 1 (Deterministic observation function). Deterministic observation functions of type O \u2236 S \u2192 Z are sufficient in POMDPs (see Remark 1 in [CCGK14]). Informally, the probabilistic aspect of the observation function can be encoded into the transition function and, by letting the product of the states and observations be the new state-space, we obtain a deterministic observation function. Thus, without loss of generality, we will always consider observation functions of type O \u2236 S \u2192 Z, which greatly simplifies the notation.\nPlays & Histories. A play (or an infinite path) in a POMDP is an infinite sequence \u03c1 = s0a0s1a1s2a2 . . . of states and actions such that s0 \u2208 Supp(\u03bb) and for all i \u2265 0 we have \u03b4(si, ai)(si+1) > 0. We write \u2126 for the set of all plays. A finite path (or just path) is a finite prefix of a play ending with a state, i.e. a sequence from (S \u22c5A)\u2217 \u22c5 S. A history is a finite sequence of actions and observations h = a0o1 . . . ai\u22121oi \u2208 (A \u22c5Z)\u2217 such that there is a path w = s0a0s1 . . . ai\u22121si with oj = O(sj) for each 1 \u2264 j \u2264 i. We write h = H(w) to indicate that history h corresponds to a path w. The length of a path (or history) w, denoted by len(w), is the number of actions in w, and the length of a play \u03c1 is len(\u03c1) =\u221e.\nBeliefs. A belief is a distribution on states (i.e. an element of D(S)) indicating the probability of being in each particular state given the current history. The initial belief \u03bb is given as part of the POMDP. Then, in each step, when the history observed so far is h, the current belief is bh, an action a \u2208 A is played and an observation z \u2208 Z is received, the updated belief bh\u2032 for history h\u2032 = hao can be computed by a standard formula [Cas98].\nInfinite-horizon Discounted Payoff. Given a play \u03c1 = s0a0s1a1s2a2 . . . and a discount factor 0 \u2264 \u03b3 < 1, the infinite-horizon discounted payoff Disc\u03b3 of \u03c1 is:\nDisc\u03b3(\u03c1) = \u2211\u221ei=0 \u03b3ir(si, ai).\nWe also define a discounted payoff of a finite path w as Disc\u03b3(w) = \u2211len(w)\u22121i=0 \u03b3ir(si, ai).\nPolicies. A policy is a blueprint for selecting actions based on the past history of observations and actions. Formally, it is a function \u03c3 which assigns to a history a probability distribution over the actions, i.e. \u03c3(h)(a) is the probability of selecting action a after observing history h (we often abbreviate \u03c3(h)(a) to \u03c3(a \u2223 h)).\nConsistent Plays. A play or a path w is consistent with a policy \u03c3 if it can be obtained by extending its finite prefixes using \u03c3. Formally, w = s0a0s1a1 . . . is consistent with \u03c3 if for each 0 \u2264 i \u2264 len(w) there is action a such that \u03c3(a \u2223H(s0a0 . . . ai\u22121si)) > 0 and \u03b4(si+1 \u2223 si, a) > 0. A history h is consistent with \u03c3 if there is a path w consistent with \u03c3 such that h =H(w).\nExpected Value eValP of Policies. Given a POMDP P , a policy \u03c3, a discount factor \u03b3, and an initial belief \u03bb, the expected value of \u03c3 from \u03bb is the expected value of the infinite-horizon discounted sum under policy \u03c3 when starting in a state sampled from \u03bb: eValP (\u03c3) = E\u03c3\u03bb[Disc\u03b3]. This definition can be formalized by a standard construction of a probability measure induced by \u03c3 over the set of all plays, which also gives rise to the expectation operator E\u03c3\u03bb (see, e.g., [Put05]).\nWorst-Case Value wValP of Policies. The worst-case value of a policy \u03c3 from belief \u03bb is wValP (\u03c3) = inf\u03c1Disc\u03b3(\u03c1), where the infimum is taken over the set of all plays that are consistent with \u03c3 and start in a state sampled from \u03bb.\nExample 1. Figure 1 shows a toy POMDP: A mining robot has to mine ore, which can be of two types (states t1 and t2). The exact type is unknown, but t1 is more likely to occur (initial belief \u03bb). The goal is to reach the \u201core mined\u201d (mnd) state, in which a lump-sum reward is received. The robot can use several mining modes: safe mode (action ms), which succeeds with probability 0.6 and does not do anything if it fails, or type-specific mining modes (m1 and m2) which succeed if applied on the correct type but result in a catastrophic failure if used on a wrong type. It can also use a sensor to accurately determine the type (after which a type-specific action can be safely used), at a cost of a one-step delay.\nAn exhaustive analysis of possible policies reveals that the expected value is maximized by any policy \u03c3 which selects m1 in the first step (we then have eVal\nP (\u03c3) = 45). However, the worst-case value of such a policy is 0, as it can result in entering fail after the first step. On the other hand, a policy \u03c3\u2032 which plays sense in the first step has eValP (\u03c3) = wValP (\u03c3) = 25.\nMain Computational Questions. The standard POMDP planning problem asks to compute (or approximate) the policy maximizing the expected value. In online POMDP planning, instead of computing the whole policy we have to compute, in each time step, the best action in the current situation. In other words, we must compute a good local approximation of a (near-)optimal policy. [RPPCd08]. In contrast, in the threshold planning problem we are asked to compute a policy maximizing the worst-case value and thus provide strict guarantees on the performance of the system [ZP96]. In this paper, we combine these two approaches and study the guaranteed payoff optimization (GPO) problem, where we are given a POMDP P and a threshold t \u2208 R and we have to compute a policy \u03c3 such that a) \u03c3 satisfies a threshold constraint : wValP (\u03c3) is at least t. b) Let gValP (t) denote the best expected value obtainable while ensuring a worst-case payoff of at least t,\ni.e. gValP (t) \u2236= sup{eVal(\u03c0) \u2223 wValP (\u03c0) \u2265 t}. Among all policies that satisfy item a), \u03c3 has \u03b5-maximal expected value, i.e. eValP (\u03c3) \u2265 gValP (t) \u2212 \u03b5. To efficiently tackle the GPO problem we aim to compute, in an online fashion, a local approximation of policy \u03c3 above. However, we do not relax requirement a). Approximations notwithstanding, the online planning algorithm we seek is such that given t, the discounted payoff of every single play that can be produced by the algorithm is at least t.\nExample 2. Take the POMDP in Figure 1 and a threshold t = 5. As shown in Example 1, a policy \u03c3\u2032 playing sense in the first step satisfies wValP (\u03c3\u2032) \u2265 t. However, there are better (w.r.t. the expected value) policies satisfying this constraint. The best such policy is a policy \u03c3\u2032\u2032 which twice plays ms and then plays sense. This policy satisfies eValP (\u03c3\u2032\u2032) = 37 and wValP (\u03c3\u2032\u2032) = 6.25. (Also note that the optimal policy to maximize the expected payoff plays m1 at the very start. However, with non-zero probability, this strategy violates the worst-case threshold t = 5.)"}, {"heading": "3 Policies for GPO Problem", "text": "We first show the GPO problem is different from the classical expectation maximization.\nExample 3 (Beliefs are not sufficient for GPO.). It is known that beliefs form a sufficient statistic of history for achieving the optimal expected value, i.e. there is always a deterministic belief-based policy \u03c3 \u2014 that is, a policy such that for each history h the distribution \u03c3(h) is Dirac and determined solely by the belief after observing h \u2014 with optimal expected value [Son71]. However, beliefs are not a sufficient statistic for the GPO problem, as witnessed by Example 2: suppose that we use policy \u03c3\u2032\u2032 and consider\nhistories h = (ms, o,ms, o) and h\u0304 = (ms, o), where o is the observation received in t1 and t2. The beliefs bh and bh\u0304 are identical, and yet \u03c3 \u2032\u2032(h) \u2260 \u03c3\u2032\u2032(h\u0304), i.e. \u03c3\u2032\u2032 is not belief-based.\nOverview of Policy Representation. We show (in Corollary 1) that a sufficient statistic for solving the GPO problem is a tuple (bh, remt\u03b3(h)), where bh is the belief after history h and remt\u03b3(h) is the \u201cremaining\u201d distance to the threshold which we need to accumulate in the future. Formally,\nremt\u03b3(h) = (t \u2212min{Disc\u03b3(w) \u2223H(w) = h}) /\u03b3len(h).\nThis is similar to other (PO)MDP planning problems that work with thresholds [Whi93, HYV16]. However, we prove more: we obtain a precise local characterization of policies that satisfy the threshold constraint. More precisely, we show that for each history h, there is a set of allowed actions Allow t\u03b3(h) such that a policy \u03c3 satisfies wValP (\u03c3) \u2265 t if and only if for each history h it holds Supp(\u03c3(h)) \u2286 Allow t\u03b3(h). We show that the function Allow t\u03b3 can be finitely represented and, for any history h, its value can be computed algorithmically. This permits us to split the solution of the GPO problem into two separate parts: 1.) We compute the function Allow t\u03b3 , and 2.) we use it to restrict a standard online planning algorithm so that it always returns an action allowed for the current history.\nAllowed Actions Allow t\u03b3. Intuitively, an action a should be allowed after some history h only if the payoff we are guaranteed to accumulate using a in the current step (i.e. mins\u2208Supp(bh) r(s, a)) plus the best payoff which we can guarantee from the next step onward is at least remt\u03b3(h). To formalize the \u201cbest payoff guaranteed from the next step on\u201d we define the future value of any history h as\nfVal(h) = sup\u03c3 wValP [bh](\u03c3),\nwhere P [bh] is a POMDP identical to P except for having initial belief bh and the supremum is taken over all policies in P [bh].\nBelief Supports Suffice for the Worst Case. The crucial observation is that the future value of a history h is determined only by the support of bh.\nLemma 1. If histories h,h\u2032 in a POMDP P are such that Supp(bh) = Supp(bh\u2032), then fVal(h) = fVal(h\u2032).\nIntuitively, this is because the worst-case value of a policy (and thus also a future value of a history) does not depend on any transition probabilities. In a slight abuse of notation, we sometimes treat fVal as a function from 2S to R, i.e. fVal(B), for B \u2286 S, is equal to fVal(h) for all histories h such that Supp(bh) = B.\n\u03a8 as an Approximation of fVal . Since computing fVal(B) exactly can be inefficient in practice, we often need to work with approximations of fVal(B), without relaxing the threshold constraint. We thus introduce a notion of a \u03a8-allowed action. Let \u03a8\u22362S \u2192 R be a function assigning numbers to belief supports. We say that an action a is \u03a8-allowed for t \u2208 R after history h, and write it a \u2208 \u03a8-Allow t\u03b3(h), if for all states s \u2208 Supp(bh) and all observations o \u2208 Z such that hao is a history it holds that\nr(s, a) + \u03b3 \u22c5\u03a8(Supp(bhao)) \u2265 remt\u03b3(h). (1)\nIf \u03a8 is the function fVal , we write simply a \u2208 Allow t\u03b3(h). We typically aim at computing a lower bound on fVal , i.e. a function \u03a8 such that \u03a8(B) \u2264 fVal(B) for each B \u2208 2S . Then, as shown below, playing \u03a8-allowed actions still guarantees that the threshold t is eventually surpassed.\nCorrectness of the Approximation. The correctness of the definition is summarized in the following proposition. We say that a policy \u03c3 is \u03a8-safe for t \u2208 R if for each history h consistent with \u03c3 it holds that Supp(\u03c3(h)) \u2286 \u03a8-Allow t\u03b3(h).\nProposition 1. Let \u03a8\u22362S \u2192 R be a function such that \u03a8(B) \u2264 fVal(B) for each B \u2208 2S. Then any policy \u03c3 that is \u03a8-safe for t satisfies wValP (\u03c3) \u2265 t. Moreover a policy \u03c0 is fVal-safe for t if and only if wValP (\u03c0) \u2265 t.\nCorollary 1. Assume that there is a policy \u03c3 with wValP (\u03c3) \u2265 t. Then there is also a policy \u03c0 such that wValP (\u03c0) \u2265 t and eValP (\u03c0) = gValP (t), and moreover, \u03c0 is belief-and-payoff, based, i.e. for all histories h,h\u2032 such that (bh, remt\u03b3(h)) = (bh\u2032 , remt\u03b3(h\u2032)) it holds \u03c0(h) = \u03c0(h\u2032).\nFrom (1) we see that to compute Allow t\u03b3(h) we have to keep track of remt\u03b3(h) (which can be easily done online) and to compute fVal(Supp(bh)) (or a suitable under-approximation thereof). In the next section we show how to do the latter.\nExample 4. Consider the POMDP from Figure 1 with a threshold t = 6.25. Then fVal({fin}) = fVal({fail}) = 0, fVal({t1, t2}) = 25, fVal({t\u20321}) = fVal({t\u20322}) = 50, and fVal({mnd}) = 100. Initially, for the empty history, we have rem6.250.5 (\u22c5) = 6.25 and therefore the only allowed actions are ms and sense because for all i \u2208 {1, 2} we have r(ti,m3\u2212i) + \u03b3fVal({fail}) < rem6.250.5 (\u22c5). Suppose that ms is played and that the next observation witnessed is O(t1) = O(t2) (thus, the belief is the same as before). We have rem6.250.5 (msO(t1)) = 12.5. In this case, the only allowed action is sense because for all i \u2208 {1,2} r(ti,ms) + \u03b3fVal({t1, t2}) < rem6.250.5 (msO(t1)) and m1 and m2 are still not allowed (since we have not accumulated any payoff and have the same belief as before). Hence, sense is played and consequently we obtain a payoff of 25 (because of discounting). We remark that 25 is, as required, above the threshold t = 6.25."}, {"heading": "4 Computing Future Values", "text": "The threshold constraint in the GPO problem is global, i.e. it talks about all runs compatible with a policy. Hence, solving the GPO problem is unlikely to be amenable to purely online methods, which compute only local approximations of policies. In this section we show how to compute future values in an offline pre-processing step. Although this requires a global analysis of a POMDP, the pre-processing step can be done efficiently since computation of future values only requires working with belief supports rather than beliefs.\nBelief Supports & Valid Belief Supports VBelSup. A belief support B \u2286 2S is valid if either B = Supp(\u03bb) or there is a history h such that B = Supp(bh). Only valid supports can be encountered during the planning process and thus we only need to compute future values thereof. We denote by VBelSup(P ) the set of valid belief supports of POMDP P ; the set can be computed by a simple iterative procedure.\nObsevable Rewards. We present efficient computation of future values under the assumption that rewards are observable. This holds for many real-world applications, see, e.g. examples in [HYV16, CCGK15]. Formally, POMDP P has observable rewards if r(s, a) = r(s\u2032, a) whenever O(s) = O(s\u2032). From a theoretical point of view, observability of rewards is necessary since without it, the computation of future values is at least as hard as solving a long-standing open problem in algebraic number theory. More precisely, if the rewards of a given POMDP are not observable, the computation of future values is at least as hard as solving the target discounted sum problem, a long-standing open problem in automata theory related to other open problems in algebra [BHO15]. However, for POMDPs with unobservable rewards we can at least obtain an under-approximation \u03a8 of fVal , and hence our framework is also applicable to them.\nLemma 2. If rewards in P are observable, then for each B \u2208 VBelSup(P ) and each s, s\u2032 \u2208 B,a \u2208 A it holds r(s, a) = r(s\u2032, a).\nWe thus define r(B,a) as r(s, a) for some s \u2208 B.\nFuture Value Characterization. We start by providing a characterization of future values. A successor of a belief support B under action a and observation o is a belief support \u2206(B,a, o) = o \u2229 \u22c3s\u2208B Supp(\u03b4(s, a)). Consider the following system of max-min equations with variables xB, B \u2208 VBelSup(P ):\nxB = max a\u2208A min o\u2208Z\n\u2206(B,a,o)\u2260\u2205\nr(B,a) + \u03b3 \u22c5 x\u2206(B,a,o). (2)\n(Each B \u2208 VBelSup(P ) appears on the LHS of exactly one equation in the system.)\nProposition 2. The system (2) has a unique solution {x\u0303B}B\u2208VBelSup(P ), and it satisfies x\u0303B = fVal(B).\nGame Perspective for the Worst Case. Hence, it suffices to find a solution to system (2). But the form of the system is identical to the one characterizing optimal values in 2-player zero-sum discounted games [ZP96]. These games can be imagined as fully-observable MDPs in which the outcomes of actions are not resolved by a random choice but by a malicious adversary. The system (2) per se corresponds to a game where elements of VBelSup(P ) are the states, actions are the same as in P , and possible effects of actions are given by the function \u2206.\nAlgorithms to Compute Future Values. Hence, to compute future values in practice we can employ one of several efficient algorithms for solving discounted-sum games (e.g. [Bre16]). A simple yet efficient approach is to use the standard value iteration for games: we compute a sequence f (0)f (1)f (2) . . . of functions of type VBelSup(P )\u2192 R such that f (0)(B) = 0 for each B, and for i \u2265 1 we inductively define\nf (i)(B) = max a\u2208A min o\u2208Z\n\u2206(B,a,o)\u2260\u2205\nr(B,a) + \u03b3 \u22c5 f (i\u22121)(\u2206(B,a, o)).\nFrom [ZP96] it follows there is always j such that for all B \u2208 VBelSup(P ) we have f j(B) = f j\u22121(B), i.e. f j(B) is the solution to (2), and moreover j \u2264 3 + log2(max(s,a)\u2208S\u00d7A \u2223r(s, a)\u2223) + 12 \u22c5 (\u2223S\u2223 + 3) 2 \u22c5 log2(den(\u03b3)) 1\u2212\u03b3 , where den(\u03b3) is a denominator of \u03b3 in its reduced form. Hence, the value iteration converges in at most exponentially many steps.1\nTheorem 1. Future values of all valid belief supports in P can be computed in time exponential in the size of P .\nAlthough the theoretical bound is exponential, there are several reasons for the method to work well in practice: (1.) In a concrete instance, the number of valid supports can be significantly smaller than exponential. (2.) Reaching the fixed-point of the value iteration may also require significantly smaller number of steps than the theoretical upper bound suggests. (3.) One can show that for each i \u2265 0, f (i) \u2264 fVal . Hence, even if reaching the fixed point takes too much time, we can set up a suitable timeout after which the value iteration is stopped, say at iteration i. Then, by Proposition 1 any policy that is f (i)-safe for t has worst-case value \u2265 t. (4.) Value iteration is a simple and standard algorithm for which efficient implementations exist (see, e.g., [LDK95, SV05]).\nImportant note on \u03a8: generally, \u03a8 \u2264 fVal does not guarantee that a \u03a8-safe policy exists, which is necessary to apply Proposition 1. The following lemma resolves this.\nLemma 3. For any i \u2265 0 the following holds for the functions f (i) produced by game value iteration: if f (i)(Supp(\u03bb)) \u2265 t, then there exists a policy \u03c3 which is f (i)-safe for t.\nIn particular, if fVal(Supp(\u03bb)) \u2265 t then a fVal -safe policy for t exists, irrespective of the way in which fVal is computed."}, {"heading": "5 Solving the GPO problem", "text": "We solve the GPO problem by modifying the partially-observable Monte Carlo planning (POMCP) algorithm [SV10].\nPOMCP. POMCP is an online planning method which in each decision epoch aims to select the best action given the current history h. In each epoch, POMCP performs a number of finite-horizon simulations starting from belief bh in order to compute a local approximation of the optimal expected value function: each simulation extends history h by selecting actions according to certain rules until the horizon is reached. The payoff of the produced path is then evaluated, and the result is used to update the optimal value approximation. After all the simulations proceed, the best action according to the estimated values is played, a new observation is received, and the process continues as above.\n1Since the number 1 1\u2212\u03b3 can be exponential in the bitsize of \u03b3.\nPOMCP data-structure. POMCP stores the information gained in past simulations in a search tree, in which each node corresponds to some history h\u2032 and contains belief bh\u2032 , the number Nh\u2032 of times the history has been observed in previous simulations, and an approximation of the optimal expected value from bh\u2032 . The search tree is used to guide simulations: each step in which the current history corresponds to an internal node of the tree is treated as a multi-armed bandit with parameters determined by numbers stored in children of this node, which balances exploration of new branches and exploitation of previous simulations (akin to the UCT algorithm for MDPs [KS06]). Once the simulation runs out of the scope of the search tree, it enters a rollout phase, where a fixed policy (e.g. selecting actions at random) is used to extend paths.\nG-POMCP: Adapting POMCP for GPO. We propose an augmentation of POMCP, which we call G-POMCP (guaranteed POMCP), specified as follows: First we enrich the nodes of the search tree so that a node corresponding to a history h additionally includes the set Bh = Supp(bh) and the number Rh = rem\u03b3t (h). When adding a new node to a search tree by extending history h with action a and observation o, these attributes for the new node are updated as follows: Bhao = \u2206(Bh, a, o) and Rhao = (rem\u03b3t (h) \u2212 r(Bh, a))/\u03b3. Note that updating Bh to Bhao requires just discrete set operations; as a matter of fact, the function \u2206 is computed already during the off-line computation of future values, after which it can be stored and used to efficiently update Bh during G-POMCP execution. In particular, updating Bh is independent of updating bh, which is important so as not to compromise the threshold constraints with issues of belief precision and particle deprivation.\nG-POMCP: playing safe. The execution of G-POMCP then proceeds in almost the same way as in POMCP, with a crucial exception: Whenever G-POMCP is to select a (real or simulated) action it selects only among those in Allow t\u03b3(h), where h is the current history. Note that checking whether an action is allowed is easy for histories within the search tree, since the necessary information (Bh and Rh) is stored in nodes of the tree. Out of the scope of the search tree, we need to update the current belief support and remaining payoff online, as the simulation proceeds. While this somewhat increases the complexity of rollouts, as current belief supports must be kept updated (POMCP only keeps track of the current state and of payoff won so far), as noted above, updating belief supports is easier than updating beliefs. Moreover, this increase in complexity is only an issue in the initial steps of the algorithm, where rollout steps dominate over tree traversal. Previous sections yield the following result:\nTheorem 2. For each threshold t \u2264 fVal(Supp(\u03bb)) the following holds: for each play \u03c1 = s0a0s1a1 . . . resulting from using G-POMCP on P ad infinitum it holds Disc\u03b3(\u03c1) \u2265 t. This holds independently of how precisely the algorithm approximates beliefs.\nSo unless it is impossible to satisfy the threshold constraint at all, it can be surely satisfied by using G-POMCP.\nConvergence. Another question is the one of convergence. An algorithm is said to be convergent in the limit if, assuming precise belief representation, the local approximation of optimal value converges to true optimal value (in our case to gValP (t)) as the number of simulations and their depth increases. The limit convergence of G-POMCP can be proved by a straightforward adaptation of the limit convergence proof of POMCP [SV10]: we map executions of G-POMCP on POMDP P to the executions of UCT on a tree-shaped MDP P \u2032, whose states are histories of P (with the empty history as root) and where finite paths correspond to extending histories in P by playing allowed actions."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments", "text": "We tested our algorithm on two classical sets of benchmarks.

In Figure 2 we have plotted the results of running our G-POMCP algorithm on several benchmarks. In all three graphics, the trade-off between worst-case guarantees and expected payoff is clearly visible: In the left figure, the expected payoff stays around 15.7 for worst-case thresholds between 0 and 6; then drops to 11.3 for threshold values above 6.5. In the center figure, the expected payoff is \u223c44.7 when the worst-case threshold is 0; stays around 36 for thresholds between 1 and 12 (with a slightly negative slope); then drops to 25 for threshold values above 12.5. Finally, in the right figure, the expected payoff steadily decreases for increasing worst-case threshold values. In particular, for threshold 0 the expected payoff is \u223c7137 while for threshold 5150 it is \u223c6161.\nLatency.

For POMDPs with non-observable rewards, there is a straightforward way of obtaining an under-approximation \u03a8 of fVal . Following the value iteration algorithm for discountedsum games outlined in Section 4 and detailed in [HM15], it is possible to obtain the exact future values. Furthermore, it is easy to see that the functions f (i) generated by the algorithm get ever closer to the actual future values. Hence, stopping the iteration at any i \u2265 0 yields the desired under-approximation. (Note that for this argument to be valid, the reward function must assign to every transition a non-negative value. However, this assumption is no loss of generality since, for any given POMDP, the threshold and the rewards of all the transitions can be \u201cshifted and scaled\u201d so that the assumption holds.)"}, {"heading": "C Formal Proof of Lemma 1 and Theorem 1", "text": "In this section we argue that, for POMDPs with observable rewards, we can reduce the computation of a policy with worst-case value above a given threshold to the computation of a policy, with the same property, in a full-observation discounted-sum game. This will give us access to the theoretical tools developed for that kind of game by the formal verification community. The idea is simple: we will construct a weighted arena in which states correspond to subsets of states from the POMDP with the same observation, and the new transitions model transitions with non-zero probability in the POMDP. This subset construction captures the fact that in a POMDP, after any history, any one from a set of possible states with the same observation could be the actual state of the system. The assumption that the POMDP has observable rewards will then allow us to weight the transitions of the arena without losing information about the original POMDP.\nWe observe that this reduction, and the fact that the policy we are looking for in the original POMDP can be directly obtained from the constructed discounted-sum game, imply that the probabilities of the POMDP do not really matter when considering the worst-case value. Thus, Lemma 1 follows.\nGiven a POMDP P = (S,A, \u03b4, r,Z,O, \u03bb) with observable rewards, we construct the weighted arena \u0393P = (Q, I,A,\u2206,w) where:\n\u2022 Q = {T \u2286 S \u2223 T \u2260 \u2205 and O(s) = O(s\u2032) for all s, s\u2032 \u2208 T} is a finite set of states;\n\u2022 I = {q \u2208 Q \u2223 Supp(\u03bb) \u2229 q = q} is the set of initial states;\n\u2022 \u2206 \u2286 Q\u00d7A\u00d7Q includes transitions of the form (q, a, q\u2032) if q, q\u2032 \u2208 Q and \u22c3s\u2208q Supp(\u03b4(s, a))\u2229O(s\u2032) = q\u2032 for any s\u2032 \u2208 q\u2032;\n\u2022 w is a weight function of the form \u2206\u2192 R determined by r as follows: w(q, a, q\u2032) = r(s, a) for any s \u2208 q.\nA play or infinite path in a weighted arena is a sequence \u03c0 = q0a0 . . .) of states and actions s.t. q0 \u2208 I and for all i \u2265 0 we have qiaiqi+1 \u2208 \u2206. We denote by \u03a0 the set of all plays. A (finite) path is a finite prefix of a play ending in a state. Since the game has full observation, a history in a weighted arena is simply a path. The discounted sum of a play is defined as for POMDPs but using the weight function w instead of r. The definitions for policy and worst-case value are then identical. (For clarity, we write wVal \u2032 instead of wVal when referring to the worst-case value in \u0393P .)\nFrom histories of the POMDP to histories in the game. We now define a mapping \u00b5 from observation-action sequences to state-action sequences in the constructed weighted arena. For a history h = a0o0 . . . from P we let \u00b5(h) = q0a0 . . . where q0 = Supp(\u03bb) and for all i \u2265 0 we have qi+1 = \u22c3s\u2208qi Supp(\u03b4(s, a)) \u2229 oi+1.\nClaim 1. The function \u00b5 is a bijective function from histories in P to paths in \u0393P .\nProof. Clearly \u00b5 is injective. We will argue that it is also bijective. Consider a path \u03c0 = q0a0 . . . qn from \u0393P . We have that \u00b5\n\u22121(\u03c0) = a0 . . . on where oi = O(si) for any si \u2208 qi and for all 0 < i \u2264 n.

By construction of \u0393P we have that, for all 0 < i \u2264 n, for all states s\u2032 \u2208 qi there is s \u2208 qi\u22121 s.t. \u03b4(s\u2032\u2223s, a) > 0. The result follows by induction.\nIt follows that there are bijective mappings from policies in P to policies in \u0393P , and from plays in P to plays in \u0393P . For a policy \u03c3 in P , let us denote by \u00b5(\u03c3) the corresponding policy in \u0393P ; for a play \u03c1 in P , \u00b5(\u03c1) for the play in \u0393P .\nLemma 4. For any policy \u03c3 in P and for any policy \u03c3\u2032 in \u0393P , if \u00b5(\u03c3) = \u03c3\u2032 then wVal(\u03c3) = wVal \u2032(\u03c3\u2032).\nProof. First, note that since P has observable rewards, then for all histories h = a0 . . . on we have that for any two paths \u03c1 = s0a0 . . . sn, \u03c1\u2032 = s\u20320a0 . . . s\u2032n s.t. H(\u03c1) =H(\u03c1\u2032) = h the following holds:\nn\u22121 \u2211 i=0 \u03b3ir(si, ai) = n\u22121 \u2211 i=0 \u03b3ir(s\u2032i, ai).\nFurthermore, by construction of \u0393P we also have that\nn\u22121 \u2211 i=0 \u03b3iw(qi, ai, qi+1) = n\u22121 \u2211 i=0 \u03b3ir(si, ai).\nThus, for the result to follow, it suffices for us to show that for any policy \u03c3 in P and corresponding \u03c3\u2032 in \u0393P , if \u00b5(\u03c3) = \u03c3\u2032 then \u00b5 is also bijective when restricted to plays consistent with \u03c3 and \u03c3\u2032 in the respective structures. We proceed by induction. Note that for any history h in P with only one observation and consistent with \u03c3 we have that \u00b5(h) is consistent with \u03c3\u2032 = \u00b5(\u03c3) since no choice has been made by the policies. Conversely, for any path \u03c0 in \u0393P with only one element, and consistent with \u03c3\n\u2032, \u00b5\u22121(\u03c0) is consistent with \u03c3 = \u00b5\u22121(\u03c0) for the same reason. Hence, for some `, \u00b5 is a bijective function from histories in P to paths in \u0393P , all of length at most `. Consider a history h = a0 . . . a`\u22121o` in P consistent with \u03c3 and let us write \u00b5(h) = q0 . . . q`. By induction hypothesis, we know \u00b5(a0 . . . o`\u22121) = q0 . . . q`\u22121 = \u03c0 is consistent with \u03c3\u2032. Observe that:\n\u2022 \u03c3\u2032(\u03c0) = \u03c3(\u00b5\u22121(\u03c0)) = \u03c3(a0 . . . o`\u22121) and therefore a` \u2208 Supp(\u03c3\u2032(\u03c0)) since h is consistent with \u03c3;\n\u2022 by definition of a history, there is some path \u03c7 = s0a0 . . . s`\u22121a`\u22121s`) in P with H(\u03c7) = h; and\n\u2022 by construction of \u0393P and definition of \u00b5 we have that s`\u22121 \u2208 q`\u22121 and (q`\u22121, a`\u22121, q`) \u2208 \u2206.\nIt follows that \u00b5(h) is also consistent with \u03c3\u2032. To show the other direction, we now take a path \u03c0 = q0a0 . . . a`\u22121q` in \u0393P consistent with \u03c3\u2032 and write \u00b5\u22121(\u03c0) = . . . o`. It follows from inductive hypothesis that \u00b5\u22121(q0 . . . q`\u22121) = . . . o`\u22121 = h is consistent with \u03c3. Since \u03c3(h) = \u03c3\u2032(\u00b5\u22121(h)), we have that Supp(\u03c3(h)) \u220b a`\u22121. Also, for any s \u2208 q` we have o` = O(s). Hence the claim holds and the result follows by induction.\nIt follows from the above arguments that computing the worst-case value can be done in exponential time for POMDPs with discounted sum and observable rewards. This is, in fact, a tight complexity result. Indeed, safety and reachability games with partial observation are EXP-hard [CD10] even if the objective is observable. One can easily reduce either of them to a discounted-sum objective in a POMDP by placing rewards or costs on target (or unsafe) transitions (depending of the game we reduce from) and asking for non-negative worst-case value. Therefore, deciding a threshold problem for the worst-case value in POMDPs with discounted sum is EXP-complete.\nTheorem 3.

The latter was shown to be more general than some important open problems in mathematics and computer science.\nThe exact GPO problem (i.e., not the -approximation we achieve in this work) is also open, even for fully-observable MDPs. Remark that if the worst-case value threshold given is in fact the future value of the initial state, then we could construct a sub-graph of choices which satisfy the equation from system (2) and be sure that it is a complete representation of the set of all policies achieving the optimal worst-case value. Hence, we could optimize the expected value in that graph only and solve the GPO problem. If the worst-case threshold is strictly lower, then this idea does not work. Indeed, sub-optimal early choices might force later turns in the game to be played optimally and vice versa as well."}], "references": [{"title": "pages 750\u2013761", "author": ["U. Boker", "T.A.

However, such policies may still permit unlikely but highly undesirable outcomes, which is problematic especially in safety-critical applications. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in POMDPs where the goal is to maximize the probability to ensure that the payoff is at least a given threshold, but these approaches do not consider any optimization beyond satisfying this threshold constraint. In this work we go beyond both the \u201cexpectation\u201d and \u201cthreshold\u201d approaches and consider a \u201cguaranteed payoff optimization (GPO)\u201d problem for POMDPs, where we are given a threshold t and the objective is to find a policy \u03c3 such that a) each possible outcome of \u03c3 yields a discounted-sum payoff of at least t, and b) the expected discounted-sum payoff of \u03c3 is optimal (or near-optimal) among all policies satisfying a). We present a practical approach to tackle the GPO problem and evaluate it on standard POMDP benchmarks.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
