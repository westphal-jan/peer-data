A large body of work in psychology and behavioral economics attempts to capture the way humans make decisions. These attempts typically address behavior patterns that consistently emerge in a specific setting, but often these patterns are different, or even contradicting, when the setting is changed. For instance, in risky choice problems, when the decision is based solely on the description of the problem people tend to overweight rare events [5], while in decisions based on experience they tend to underweight rare events (see review of the experience-description gap in [4]).\nRecently, researchers were challenged in the Choice Prediction Competition (CPC) 2015 [2] to propose a model that will be general enough to predict human decisions for a wide space of problems. The competition focused on 14 well-studied choice anomalies, which included the four biases captured by prospect theory [5] (including overweighting of rare events), and additional 10 biases that were documented in studies of decisions with and without feedback (including underweighting of rare events in repeated settings with feedback). The organizers, Erev et al. (2015), defined a problem space for which they showed that these anomalies emerge (in a series of experiments). The challenge for the competitors was to develop a model that would best predict the decisions made by humans in any problem in this problem space. For the full description of the competition see [2] and the competition website. Next we briefly describe the main details. The Problem Space: The organizers defined an 11-dimensional problem space of choice tasks that is wide enough to give rise to the 14 choice anomalies discussed above. Denote the problem space by PS = LA\u00d7HA\u00d7 pHA\u00d7LB\u00d7HB\u00d7pHB\u00d7LotNum\u00d7LotShape\u00d7Corr\u00d7Amb\u00d7FB. Each problem x \u2208 PS is a choice between two gamble options A and B. Option A provides the high outcome HA with probability pHA, and the low outcome LA otherwise. Option B provides with probability pHB, an outcome of a lottery with an expected value HB, or LB otherwise. LotNum defines the number of possible outcomes in the lottery and LotShape defines whether the lottery\u2019s distribution is symmetric, right-skewed, or left-skewed around its mean (or is undefined if LotNum = 1). Corr determines the sign of the correlation between the payoffs of the two options.\nThe 10th dimension, Ambiguity (Amb), defines the precision of the initial information the decision maker receives regarding the probabilities of the outcomes in Option B. The competition focused on the two extreme cases: Amb = 0 implies complete information (i.e., no ambiguity), and Amb =\n1 implies that the decision maker does not receive any initial information regarding option B\u2019s probabilities. The 11th dimension is the feedback to the decision maker and was studied within a problem: subjects repeatedly faced each problem, first without any feedback and then with complete feedback. Data: Prior to the competition announcement, the organizers performed two preliminary experiments. In each experiment, human participants were presented with a set of decision problems drawn from the problem space. Participants faced each problem for 25 trials. In the first five trials they did not receive any feedback, while following each of the remaining 20 trials they received full feedback of the obtained and forgone outcomes. The 25 trials were divided to five blocks, each consisting of five consecutive trials, and the average portion of option B choosers (the B-rate) was recorded for each block. In the first experiment, 30 hand-tailored problems in the problem space were used for replicating the emergence of the 14 choice anomalies mentioned above. The second experiment used 60 problems that were randomly generated from the problem space, to show the robustness of the anomalies. The Challenge: Given the parameters and B-rates for these 90 decision problems (the estimation set), the competitors were asked to provide a model (in the form of a program), which receives a problem represented by the first 10 parameters described above1 and outputs five B-rates, one for each block. The model must capture all 14 choice anomalies (represented by a published script containing 14 tests which the model should pass), and should be easy and straight-forward to implement (from a description of at most 1500 words).\nTo evaluate the models, the organizers ran a third experiment using 60 new randomly generated decision problems. The results of this experiment were used for evaluating the competitors\u2019 models (the test set), using the Mean Squared Deviation (MSD) score. For a set of observations OBSj and a set of predictions Bj for problems j = 1..N :\nMSD(OBS,B) = 100 \u00b7 1\nN\n\u2211\nj\n(OBSj \u2212 Bj) 2 (1)\nThe final evaluation metric is the MSD averaged over all five blocks. Our Approach: The common approach towards solving this problem in behavioral fields is to derive patterns from behavior observed in experiments (in some setting), and then define a model which employs these patterns to make a prediction, all generally based on well-established literature (see, for example, the competition baseline model [2]). These approaches put the\n1The 11th parameter is tested within a problem.\nemphasis on characterizing or describing the observed behavior, but generally use simple, hand-tuned methods to make the actual prediction.\nWe choose to take a different approach towards modeling human decision making. We use the behavioral theory based patterns to compute a feature representation for the decision problem, to be used as input to powerful machine learning algorithms. In this prospect, the computational field of machine learning has much to offer, from sophisticated learning algorithms to efficient ways for feature selection and reduction, as well as reliable validation techniques.\nIn this work we implement a vanilla version of a hybrid model that combines Support Vector Machines (SVM) models with behavioral-based features and adjustments. The behavioral features are computed based on an effective (i.e., biased) form of the target problem. Our hybrid model was ranked lower than most of the variants of the baseline model, but outperformed all the learning-based models in the competition, demonstrating that these psychological features are important for the success of the learning process.\nIn the next section we present the details of our hybrid model and in Section 3 we present the competition results and conclude with future research directions."}, {"heading": "2 The Hybrid Model", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Feature representation", "text": "Each sample representing a problem p is given by 10 parameters: LA,HA, pHA, LB,HB, pHB,LotNum,LotShape, Corr, Amb (the first 10 coordinates of the problem space PS). For each block i of consecutive five choice trials, we compute a feature representation f ip that is consisted of (24+i-1) features, as follows.\nFirst, we generate a problem pieff by converting p\u2019s probabilities \u2013 pHa and pHb \u2013 to their effectiveform at block i. Specifically, set pHa = effective(pHa, i) and pHb = effective(pHb, i), by:\neffective(p, i) =\n\n \n \np i if p \u2264 0.02 p+ (1\u2212 1 i ) \u00b7 (1\u2212 p) if p \u2265 0.98 p otherwise\nThat is, the effective form of a problem reflects the tendency to underweight rare probabilities as i increases.\nNext, we compute a list of 16 behavior-based features from the parameters of pieff . These features were designed to capture salient properties of the\nproblem, which play a role when people face the problem of choosing between options A and B, in our setting of small decisions under risk and ambiguity. Most of these features are derived from the baseline model provided by [2]. The features include properties of a single option as well as properties that refer to the problem as a whole.\nThe features make use of the full distributions of options A and B. Let us annotate these distributions by DistA = (oa1, p a 1; o a 2, p a 2; ...; o a sa , pasa) and DistB = (ob1, p b 1; o b 2, p b 2; ...; o b sb , pbsb), i.e., the full outcomes and probabilities, where the outcomes o\u2217j appear in ascending order. We proceed to describe all the features.\n1. IsGain: equals 1 if the portion of non-negative outcomes is greater than 0.65 and at least one outcome is strictly positive, or 0 otherwise.\n2.

In particular, it performed better than all of the learningbased models that did not make use of behavioral theories. These results suggest that learning methods alone are not sufficient for predicting human decisions, and that representing and manipulating the data based on behavioral knowledge is important for the success of these methods, supporting our approach of integrating behavioral features and adjustments with the powerful machine learning tools to improve their performance.\nHowever, the fact that the hybrid model was ranked lower than the baseline model and its variants, indicates that this integration should be further studied and improved. We believe that a first major improvement to the preliminary results shown in this paper can be obtained by further experimenting with the full range of parameters available for SVM, as well as trying other machine learning methods. A second significant improvement may be obtained by learning from a larger training set. Running large scale experiments is becoming more applicable with the growing popularity of online labor markets such as Amazon Mechanical Turk.
