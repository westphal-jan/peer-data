The basic idea is that a patient (called a case) is typically paired with a clinically similar patient (called a control) with respect to ICD code sequence. To determine the similarity of two ICD code sequences, one can compare their primary diagnosis (i.e., their first ICD code) [1, 6] or compute their Hamming distance [5]. A major difficulty in comparing ICD code sequences is the variation in encoding, i.e., different ICD codes can be used to record the same disease. For example, both ICD codes I20.0 and R57.0 are related to \u201cheart issue\u201d. Another difficulty is the sequential importance in the code sequences. Most existing approaches miss to leverage either the clinical relation among syntactically different ICD codes or the relative position of ICD codes within a sequence [5, 6].\nTo incorporate these two sets of important information in patient similarity matching, we here introduce WVM, a method that matches sequences of ICD codes within the embedded vector space. The method embeds ICD codes using Word2Vec [7] to capture semantic similarity among syntactically different codes. It also has a new sequential matching technique that leverages the domain coding convention to capture similarity among patients with complex syndromes and comorbidities. Our proposed method not only addresses the unavoidable coding variation problem but also considers the important sequential structure in ICD code sequences. We evaluate the performance of our model based on the similarity of the matched patients on two sets of outcomes: 28-day readmission and death due to cancer. A good matching should produce patient pairs similar in these two outcomes. Our cohort consists of more than 220,000 patients whose data were collected from a state-wide cancer registry in Australia\u2014The study constitutes the first step for a set of comparative observational studies. While sharing a similarity with medical concept embedding as in Code sum based matching (CSM) [2], our framework with the proposed sequential matching yields better matching result. In comparison with recent non-embedding approaches such as Primary code based matching (PCM) [6] and Hamming distance based matching (HDM) [5], we also achieve a better performance."}, {"heading": "2 Word2Vec based matching (WVM)", "text": "The proposed WVM method for patient similarity matching has two phases.\n30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain.\nar X\niv :1\n61 2.\n01 81\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\nD ec\n2 01"}, {"heading": "2.1 Phase 1: Learning ICD code vectors", "text": "WVM uses Word2Vec (Skip-gram model [7]) to learn ICD code vectors that can capture the latent relations among ICD codes.

Those ICD code vectors are then used in a sequential matching algorithm in phase 2."}, {"heading": "2.2 Phase 2: Building a matching algorithm", "text": "The inputs of the sequential matching (SM) algorithm are a group of cases (case group) and a group of controls (control group). We will describe how we select case group and control group in Section 3.2. SM has three main steps. Step 1: For a given case tc(i) it finds a validation group that consists of the controls that have the same gender and age group with tc(i). Matching on factors such as gender and age is commonly used in case-control studies [8]. Step 2: It generates two sets S and matched to store the controls that match t ICD codes in tc(i) (t \u2208 [0,n], where n is the number of ICD codes in tc(i)). Step 3: It matches tc(i) with a control based on S and matched.\nIn steps 2 and 3, to find a matching control for tc(i), there are three scenarios to consider.\nScenario 1: We can find the controls that match all ICD codes in tc(i). SM selects randomly a control in S for it to be the matching control mc.\nScenario 2: We cannot find any control that matches all ICD codes in tc(i) but we are still able to find the controls that match at least one ICD code in tc(i). Thus, S is empty but matched is not. Assume that matched contains the controls that match (k\u22121) ICD codes in tc(i). Since we cannot find any control that matches the kth ICD code in tc(i) (called tc(i)k ), SM tries to search for a control vc( j) whose the kth ICD code (called vc( j)k ) is similar to tc (i) k . SM first obtains the ICD code vector vi of tc (i) k . For each vc ( j) in matched, it obtains the ICD code vector v j of vc ( j) k . It then computes the cosine distance between vi and v j. The matching control for tc(i) is the one with the smallest distance.\nScenario 3: We cannot find any control that matches the first ICD code in tc(i). Thus, both S and matched are empty. SM attempts to match tc(i) with a control in validation group whose the first ICD code is similar to the first ICD code in tc(i) by computing the distance between them.\nWe provide three examples as shown in Figures 1-3 to demonstrate the three scenarios processed by steps 2 and 3."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Data", "text": "The dataset is a cancer cohort of more than 220,000 patients (58.2% males, median age 71), collected between 1997 and 2012 from a state-wide cancer registry including 21 hospitals in Australia.

The evaluation on two similarity measures based on clinical outcomes, namely readmission matching accuracy and incidence rate error for cancer mortality, proves that WVM constitutes an effective solution for patient similarity matching in a large cancer cohort. In practice, it means that WVM can identify a control cohort better matching the case cohort, hence minimizing the potential bias between the two cohorts. This enables more effective experiment or quasi-experiment designs using a large coded dataset that is similar to ours.\n1For a given case tc(i), CSM sums up the vectors of all ICD codes in tc(i) into a single vector. For each control, it performs the same task. It then determines the similarity between tc(i) and a control by computing the cosine distance between their summed vectors."}], "references": [{"title": "Mcneill dysphagia therapy program: a
