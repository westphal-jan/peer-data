GANs cast generative model training as a minimax game between a generative network (generator), which maps a random vector into the data space, and a discriminative network (discriminator), whose objective is to distinguish generated samples from real samples. Multiple researchers Radford et al. (2015); Salimans et al. (2016); Zhao et al. (2016) have shown that the adversarial interaction with the discriminator can result in a generator that produces compelling samples. The empirical successes of the GAN framework were also supported by the theoretical analysis of Goodfellow et al., who showed that, under certain conditions, the distribution produced by the generator converges to the true data distribution, while the discriminator converges to a degenerate uniform solution.\nWhile GANs have excelled as compelling sample generators, their use as general purpose probabilistic generative models has been limited by the difficulty in using them to provide density estimates or even unnormalized energy values for sample evaluation.\nIt is tempting to consider the GAN discriminator as a candidate for providing this sort of scoring function. Conceptually, it is a trainable sample evaluation mechanism that \u2013 owing to GAN training paradigm \u2013 could be closely calibrated to the distribution modeled by the generator. If the discriminator could retain fine-grained information of the relative quality of samples, measured for instance by probability density or unnormalized energy, it could be used as an evaluation metric. Such data-driven evaluators would be highly desirable for problems where it is difficult to define evaluation criteria that correlate well with human judgment. Indeed, the real-valued discriminator of the recently introduced energy-based GANs Zhao et al. (2016) might seem like an ideal candidate energy function. Unfortunately, as we will show, the degenerate fate of the GAN discriminator at the optimum equally afflicts the energy-based GAN of Zhao et al..\nIn this paper we consider the questions: (i) does there exists an adversarial framework that induces a non-degenerate discriminator, and (ii) if so, what form will the resulting discriminator take? We introduce a novel adversarial learning formulation, which leads to a non-degenerate discriminator while ensuring the generator distribution matches the data distribution at the global optimum.

Taking this idea one step further, apprenticeship learning or imitation learning (Abbeel & Ng, 2004; Ziebart et al., 2008) aims at learning a policy (analogous to the generator) using the reward signals recovered by IRL. Notably, Ho & Ermon draw a connection between imitation learning and GAN by showing that the GAN formulation can be derived by imposing a specific regularization on the reward function. Also, under a special case of their formulation, Ho & Ermon provide a duality-based interpretation of the problem, which inspires our theoretical analysis. However, as the focus of (Ho & Ermon, 2016) is only on the policy, the authors explicitly propose to bypass the intermediate IRL step, and thus provide no analysis of the learned reward function.\nThe GAN models most closely related to our proposed framework are energy-based GAN models of Zhao et al. (2016) and Kim & Bengio (2016). In the next section, We show how one can derive both of these approaches from different assumptions regarding regularization of the generative model."}, {"heading": "3 ALTERNATIVE FORMULATION OF ADVERSARIAL TRAINING", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 BACKGROUND", "text": "Before presenting the proposed formulation, we first state some basic assumptions required by the analysis, and introduce notations used throughout the paper.\nFollowing the original work on GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014), our analysis focuses on the nonparametric case, where all models are assumed to have infinite capacities. While many of the nonparametric intuitions can directly transfer to the parametric case, we will point out cases where this transfer fails. We assume a finite data space throughout the analysis, to avoid technical machinery out of the scope of this paper. Our results, however, can be extended to continuous data spaces, and our experiments are indeed performed on continuous data.\nLet X be the data space under consideration, and P = {p | p(x) \u2265 0,\u2200x \u2208 X , \u2211 x\u2208X p(x) = 1} be the set of all proper distributions defined on X . Then, pdata \u2208 P : X 7\u2192 R and pgen \u2208 P : X 7\u2192 R will denote the true data distribution and the generator distribution. Ex\u223cp f(x) denotes the expectation of the quantity f(x) w.r.t. x drawn from p. Finally, the term \u201cdiscriminator\u201d will refer to any structure that provides training signals to the generator based on some measure of difference between the generator distribution and the real data distribution, which which includes but is not limited to f -divergence."}, {"heading": "3.2 PROPOSED FORMULATION", "text": "In order to understand the motivation of the proposed approach, it is helpful to analyze the optimization dynamics near convergence in GANs first.\nWhen the generator distribution matches the data distribution, the training signal (gradient) w.r.t. the discriminator vanishes. At this point, assume the discriminator still retains density information, and views some samples as more real and others as less. This discriminator will produce a training signal (gradient) w.r.t. the generator, pushing the generator to generate samples that appear more real to the discriminator. Critically, this training signal is the sole driver of the generator\u2019s training. Hence, the generator distribution will diverge from the data distribution. In other words, as long as the discriminator retains relative density information, the generator distribution cannot stably match the data distribution. Thus, in order to keep the generator stationary as the data distribution, the discriminator must assign flat (exactly the same) density to all samples at the optimal.\nFrom the analysis above, the fundamental difficulty is that the generator only receives a single training signal (gradient) from the discriminator, which it has to follow. To keep the generator stationary, this single training signal (gradient) must vanish, which requires a degenerate discriminator. In this work, we propose to tackle this single training signal constraint directly. Specifically, we introduce a novel adversarial learning formulation which incorporates an additional training signal to the generator, such that this additional signal can\n\u2022 balance (cancel out) the discriminator signal at the optimum, so that the generator can stay stationary even if the discriminator assigns non-flat density to samples\n\u2022 cooperate with the discriminator signal to make sure the generator converges to the data distribution, and the discriminator retains the correct relative density information\nThe proposed formulation can be written as the following minimax training objective,\nmax c min pgen\u2208P E x\u223cpgen\n[ c(x) ] \u2212 E x\u223cpdata [ c(x) ] +K(pgen), (1)\nwhere c(x) : X 7\u2192 R is the discriminator that assigns each data point an unbounded scalar cost, and K(pgen) : P 7\u2192 R is some (functionally) differentiable, convex function of pgen. Compared to the original GAN, despite the similar minimax surface form, the proposed fomulation has two crucial distinctions.\nFirstly, while the GAN discriminator tries to distinguish \u201cfake\u201d samples from real ones using binary classification, the proposed discriminator achieves that by assigning lower cost to real samples and higher cost to \u201cfake\u201d one. This distinction can be seen from the first two terms of Eqn. (1), where the discriminator c(x) is trained to widen the expected cost gap between \u201cfake\u201d and real samples, while the generator is adversarially trained to minimize it. In addition to the different adversarial mechanism, a calibrating term K(pgen) is introduced to provide a countervailing source of training signal for pgen as we motivated above. For now, the form of K(pgen) has not been specified. But as we will see later, its choice will directly decide the form of the optimal discriminator c\u2217(x).\nWith the specific optimization objective, we next provide theoretical characterization of both the generator and the discriminator at the global optimum.\nDefine L(pgen, c) = Ex\u223cpgen [ c(x) ] \u2212Ex\u223cpdata [ c(x) ] +K(pgen), then L(pgen, c) is the Lagrange dual function of the following optimization problem\nmin pgen\u2208P K(pgen)\ns.t. pgen(x)\u2212 pdata(x) = 0,\u2200x \u2208 X (2)\nwhere c(x),\u2200x appears in L(pgen, c) as the dual variables introduced for the equality constraints. This duality relationship has been observed previously in (Ho & Ermon, 2016, equation (7)) under the adversarial imitation learning setting. However, in their case, the focus was fully on the generator side (induced policy), and no analysis was provided for the discriminator (reward function).\nIn order to characterize c\u2217, we first expand the set constraint on pgen into explicit equality and inequality constraints:\nmin pgen K(pgen)\ns.t. pgen(x)\u2212 pdata(x) = 0,\u2200x \u2212 pgen(x) \u2264 0,\u2200x\u2211 x\u2208X pgen(x)\u2212 1 = 0.\n(3)\nNotice thatK(pgen) is a convex function of pgen(x) by definition, and both the equality and inequality constraints are affine functions of pgen(x). Thus, problem (2) is a convex optimization problem. What\u2019s more, since (i) domK is open, and (ii) there exists a feasible solution pgen = pdata to (3), by the refined Slater\u2019s condition (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004, page 226), we can further verify that strong duality holds for (3). With strong duality, a typical approach to characterizing the optimal solution is to apply the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, which gives rise to this theorem:\nProposition 3.1. By the KKT conditions of the convex problem (3), at the global optimum, the optimal generator distribution p\u2217gen matches the true data distribution pdata, and the optimal discriminator c\u2217(x) has the following form:\nc\u2217(x) = \u2212 \u2202K(pgen)\n\u2202pgen(x) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 pgen=pdata \u2212 \u03bb\u2217 + \u00b5\u2217(x),\u2200x \u2208 X ,\nwhere \u00b5\u2217(x) = { 0, pdata(x) > 0\nux, pdata(x) = 0 ,\n\u03bb\u2217 \u2208 R, is an under-determined real number independent of x, ux \u2208 R+, is an under-determined non-negative real number.\n(4)\nThe detailed proof of proposition 3.1 is provided in appendix A.1. From (4), we can see the exact form of the optimal discriminator depends on the term K(pgen), or more specifically its gradient. But, before we instantiateK(pgen) with specific choices and show the corresponding forms of c\u2217(x), we first discuss some general properties of c\u2217(x) that do not depend on the choice of K.\nWeak Support Discriminator. As part of the optimal discriminator function, the term \u00b5\u2217(x) plays the role of support discriminator. That is, it tries to distinguish the support of the data distribution, i.e. SUPP(pdata) = {x \u2208 X | pdata(x) > 0}, from its complement set with zeroprobability, i.e. SUPP(pdata){ = {x \u2208 X | pdata(x) = 0}. Specifically, for any x \u2208 SUPP(pdata) and x\u2032 \u2208 SUPP(pdata){, it is guaranteed that \u00b5\u2217(x) \u2264 \u00b5\u2217(x\u2032). However, because \u00b5\u2217(\u00b7) is underdetermined, there is nothing preventing the inequality from degenerating into an equality. Therefore, we name it the weak support discriminator. But, in all cases, \u00b5\u2217(\u00b7) assigns zero cost to all data points within the support. As a result, it does not possess any fine-grained density information inside of the data support. It is worth pointing out that, in the parametric case, because of the smoothness and the generalization properties of the parametric model, the learned discriminator may generalize beyond the data support.\nGlobal Bias. In (4), the term \u03bb\u2217 is a scalar value shared for all x. As a result, it does not affect the relative cost among data points, and only serves as a global bias for the discriminator function.\nHaving discussed general properties, we now consider some specific cases of the convex function K, and analyze the resulting optimal discriminator c\u2217(x) in detail.\n1. First, let us consider the case where K is the negative entropy of the generator distribution, i.e. K(pgen) = \u2212H(pgen). Taking the derivative of the negative entropy w.r.t. pgen(x), we have\nc\u2217ent(x) = \u2212 log pdata(x)\u2212 1\u2212 \u03bb\u2217 + \u00b5\u2217(x),\u2200x \u2208 X , (5) where \u00b5\u2217(x) and \u03bb\u2217 have the same definitions as in (4). Up to a constant, this form of c\u2217ent(x) is exactly the energy function of the data distribution pdata(x). This elegant result has deep connections to several existing formulations, which include max-entropy imitation learning (Ziebart et al., 2008) and the directed-generator-trained energybased model (Kim & Bengio, 2016). The core difference is that these previous formulations are originally derived from maximum-likelihood estimation, and thus the minimax optimization is only implicit. In contrast, with an explicit minimax formulation we can develop a better understanding of the induced solution. For example, the global bias \u03bb\u2217 suggests that there exists more than one stable equilibrium the optimal discriminator can actually reach. Further, \u00b5\u2217(x) can be understood as a support discriminator that poses extra cost on generator samples which fall in zero-probability regions of data space.\n2. When K(pgen) = 12 \u2211 x\u2208X pgen(x) 2 = 12\u2016pgen\u2016 2 2, which can be understood as posing `2 regular-\nization on pgen, we have \u2202K(pgen) \u2202pgen(x) \u2223\u2223 pgen=pdata = pdata(x), and it follows\nc\u2217`2(x) = \u2212pdata(x)\u2212 \u03bb \u2217 + \u00b5\u2217(x),\u2200x \u2208 X , (6)\nwith \u00b5\u2217(x), \u03bb\u2217 similarly defined as in (4). Surprisingly, the result suggests that the optimal discriminator c\u2217`2(x) directly recovers the negative probability \u2212pdata(x), shifted by a constant. Thus, similar to the entropy solution (5), it fully retains the relative density information of data points within the support.\nHowever, because of the under-determined term \u00b5\u2217(x), we cannot recover the distribution density pdata exactly from either c\u2217`2 or c \u2217 ent if the data support is finite. Whether this ambiguity can\nbe resolved is beyond the scope of this paper, but poses an interesting research problem. 3. Finally, let\u2019s consider consider a degenerate case, where K(pgen) is a constant. That is, we dont\nprovide any additional training signal for pgen at all. With K(pgen) = const, we simply have\nc\u2217cst(x) = \u03bb \u2217 + \u00b5\u2217(x),\u2200x \u2208 X , (7)\nwhose discriminative power is fully controlled by the weak support discriminator \u00b5\u2217(x). Thus, it follows that c\u2217cst(x) won\u2019t be able to discriminate data points within the support of pdata, and its power to distinguish data from SUPP(pdata) and SUPP(pdata){ is weak. This closely matches the intuitive argument in the beginning of this section. Note that when K(pgen) is a constant, the objective function (1) simplifies to:\nmax c min pgen\u2208P E x\u223cpgen\n[ c(x) ] \u2212 E x\u223cpdata [ c(x) ] , (8)\nwhich is very similar to the EBGAN objective (Zhao et al., 2016, equation (2) and (4)). As we show in appendix A.2, compared to the objective in (8), the EBGAN objective puts extra constraints on the allowed discriminator function. In spite of that, the EBGAN objective suffers from the single-training-signal problem and does not guarantee that the discriminator will recover the real energy function (see appendix A.2 for detailed analysis).\nAs we finish the theoretical analysis of the proposed formulation, we want to point out that simply adding the same term K(pgen) to the original GAN formulation will not lead to both a generator that matches the data distribution, and a discriminator that retains the density information (see appendix A.3 for detailed analysis)."}, {"heading": "4 PARAMETRIC INSTANTIATION WITH ENTROPY APPROXIMATION", "text": "While the discussion in previous sections focused on the non-parametric case, in practice we are limited to a finite amount of data, and the actual problem involves high dimensional continuous spaces. Thus, we resort to parametric representations for both the generator and the discriminator. In order to train the generator using standard back-propagation, we do not parametrize the generator distribution directly. Instead, we parametrize a directed generator network that transforms random noise z \u223c pz(z) to samples from a continuous data space Rn. Consequently, we don\u2019t have analytical access to the generator distribution, which is defined implicitly by the generator network\u2019s noise\u2192data mapping. However, the regularization term K(pgen) in the training objective (1) requires the generator distribution. Faced with this problem, we focus on the max-entropy formulation, and exploit two different approximations of the regularization term K(pgen) = \u2212H(pgen)."}, {"heading": "4.1 NEAREST-NEIGHBOR ENTROPY GRADIENT APPROXIMATION", "text": "The first proposed solution is built upon an intuitive interpretation of the entropy gradient. Firstly, since we construct pgen by applying a deterministic, differentiable transform g\u03b8 to samples z from a fixed distribution pz , we can write the gradient of H(pgen) with respect to the generator parameters \u03b8 as follows:\n\u2212\u2207\u03b8H(pgen) = Ez\u223cpz [\u2207\u03b8 log pgen(g\u03b8(z))] = Ez\u223cpz [ \u2202g\u03b8(z)\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202 log pgen(g\u03b8(z))\n\u2202g\u03b8(z)\n] , (9)\nwhere the first equality relies on the \u201creparametrization trick\u201d. Equation 9 implies that, if we can compute the gradient of the generator log-density log pgen(x) w.r.t. any x = g\u03b8(z), then we can directly construct the Monte-Carlo estimation of the entropy gradient \u2207\u03b8H(pgen) using samples from the generator.\nIntuitively, for any generated data x = g\u03b8(z), the term \u2202 log pgen(x)\n\u2202x essentially describes the direction of local change in the sample space that will increase the log-density. Motivated by this intuition, we propose to form a local Gaussian approximation pigen of pgen around each point xi in a batch of samples {x1, ..., xn} from the generator, and then compute the gradient \u2202 log pgen(xi)\u2202xi based on the\nGaussian approximation. Specifically, each local Gaussian approximation pigen is formed by finding the k nearest neighbors of xi in the batch {x1, ..., xn}, and then placing an isotropic Gaussian distribution at their mean (i.e. maximimum likelihood). Based on the isotropic Gaussian approximation, the resulting gradient has the following form\n\u2202 log pgen(xi)\n\u2202xi \u2248 \u00b5i \u2212 xi, where \u00b5i =\n1\nk \u2211 x\u2032\u2208KNN(xi) x\u2032 is the mean of the Gaussian (10)\nFinally, note the scale of this gradient approximation may not be reliable. To fix this problem, we normalize the approximated gradient into unit norm, and use a single hyper-parameter to model the scale for all x, leading to the following entropy gradient approximation\n\u2212\u2207\u03b8H(pgen) \u2248 \u03b1 1\nk \u2211 xi=g\u03b8(zi) \u00b5i \u2212 xi \u2016\u00b5i \u2212 xi\u20162\n(11)\nwhere \u03b1 is the hyper-parameter and \u00b5i is defined as in equation (10).\nAn obvious weakness of this approximation is that it relies on Euclidean distance to find the k nearest neighbors. However, Euclidean distance is usually not the proper metric to use when the effective dimension is very high. As the problem is highly challenging, we leave it for future work."}, {"heading": "4.2 VARIATIONAL LOWER BOUND ON THE ENTROPY", "text": "Another approach we consider relies on defining and maximizing a variational lower bound on the entropy H(pgen(x)) of the generator distribution. We can define the joint distribution over observed data and the noise variables as pgen(x, z) = pgen(x | z)pgen(z), where simply pgen(z) = pz(z) is a fixed prior. Using the joint, we can also define the marginal pgen(x) and the posterior pgen(z | x). We can also write the mutual information between the observed data and noise variables as:\nI(pgen(x); pgen(z)) = H(pgen(x))\u2212H(pgen(x | z)) = H(pgen(z))\u2212H(pgen(z | x)),\n(12)\nwhere H(pgen(. | .)) denotes the conditional entropy. By reorganizing terms in this definition, we can write the entropy H(pgen(x)) as:\nH(pgen(x)) = H(pgen(z))\u2212H(pgen(z | x)) +H(pgen(x | z)) (13)\nWe can think of pgen(x | z) as a peaked Gaussian with a fixed, diagonal covariance, and hence its conditional entropy is constant and can be dropped. Furthermore, H(pgen(z)) is also assumed to be fixed a priori. Hence, we can maximize H(pgen(x)) by minimizing the conditional entropy:\nH(pgen(z | x)) = Ex\u223cpgen(x) [ Ez\u223cpgen(z|x) [\u2212 log pgen(z | x)] ] (14)\nOptimizing this term is still problematic, because (i) we do not have access to the posterior pgen(z | x), and (ii) we cannot sample from it. Therefore, we instead minimize a variational upper bound defined by an approximate posterior qgen(z | x):\nH(pgen(z | x)) = Ex\u223cpgen(x) [ Ez\u223cpgen(z|x) [\u2212 log qgen(z | x)]\u2212 KL(pgen(z | x)\u2016qgen(z | x)) ] \u2264 Ex\u223cpgen(x) [ Ez\u223cpgen(z|x) [\u2212 log qgen(z | x)]\n] = U(qgen).\n(15)\nWe can also rewrite the variational upper bound as: U(qgen) = Ex,z\u223cpgen(x,z) [\u2212 log qgen(z | x)] = Ez\u223cpgen(z) [ Ex\u223cpgen(x|z) [\u2212 log qgen(z | x)] ] , (16)\nwhich can be optimized efficiently with standard back-propagation and Monte Carlo integration of the relevant expectations based on independent samples drawn from the joint pgen(x, z). By minimizing this upper bound on the conditional entropy H(pgen(z | x)), we are effectively maximizing a variational lower bound on the entropy H(pgen(x))."}, {"heading": "5 EXPERIMENTS", "text": "In this section, we verify our theoretical results empirically on several synthetic and real datasets.

We visualize the ground-truth energy of these distributions along with 100K training samples in Figure 1. Since the data lies in 2-dimensional space, we can easily visualize both the learned generator (by drawing samples) and the discriminator for direct comparison and evaluation. We evaluate here our EGAN-Ent model using both approximations: the nearest-neighbor based approximation (EGAN-Ent-NN) and the variational-inference based approximation (EGAN-Ent-VI), and compare them with two baselines: the original GAN and the energy based GAN with no regularization (EGAN-Const).\nExperiment results are summarized in Figure 2 for baseline models, and Figure 3 for the proposed models. As we can see, all four models can generate perfect samples. However, for the discriminator, both GAN and EGAN-Const lead to degenerate solution, assigning flat energy inside the empirical data support. In comparison, EGAN-Ent-VI and EGAN-Ent-NN clearly capture the density information, though to different degrees. Specifically, on the equally weighted Gaussian mixture and the two-spiral mixture datasets, EGAN-Ent-NN tends to give more accurate and fine-grained solutions compared to EGAN-Ent-VI. However, on the biased weighted Gaussian mixture dataset, EGAN-Ent-VI actually fails to captures the correct mixture weights of the two modes, incorrectly assigning lower energy to the mode with lower probability (smaller weight).

We can notice that all of the top-ranked images by EGAN-Ent-NN look similar to the mean sample. In addition, the lowest-ranked images are clearly different from the mean image, with either high (clockwise or counter-clockwise) rotation degrees from the mean, or an extreme thickness level.

In addition, the discriminator is designed to produce the mean squared reconstruction error of an auto-encoder structure. This restricted the range of the discriminator output to be non-negative, which is equivalent to posing a set constraint on the discriminator under the non-parametric setting.\nThus, to characterize the optimal generator and discriminator, we adapt the same analyzing logic used in the proof sketch of the original GAN (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Specifically, given a specific generator distribution pgen, the optimal discriminator function given the generator distribution c\u2217(x; pgen) can be derived by examining the objective of the discriminator. Then, the conditional optimal discriminator function is substituted into the training objective of pgen, simplifying the \u201cadversarial\u201d training as a minimizing problem only w.r.t. pgen, which can be well analyzed.\nFirstly, given any generator distribution pgen, the EBGAN training objective for the discriminator can be written as the following form\nc\u2217(x; pgen) = argmax c\u2208C \u2212 E pgen max(0,m\u2212 c(x))\u2212 E pdata c(x)\n= argmax c\u2208C E pgen min(0, c(x)\u2212m)\u2212 E pdata\nc(x) (19)\nwhere C = {c : c(x) \u2265 0,\u2200x \u2208 X} is the set of allowed non-negative discriminator functions. Note this set constraint comes from the fact the mean squared reconstruction error as discussed above.\nSince the problem (19) is independent w.r.t. each x, the optimal solution can be easily derived as\nc\u2217(x; pgen) =  0, pgen(x) < pdata(x) m, pgen(x) > pdata(x) \u03b1x, pgen(x) = pdata(x) > 0\n\u03b2x, pgen(x) = pdata(x) = 0\n(20)\nwhere \u03b1x \u2208 [0,m] is an under-determined number, a \u03b2x \u2208 [0,\u221e) is another under-determined nonnegative real number, and the subscripts in m,\u03b1x, \u03b2x reflect that fact that these under-determined values can be distinct for different x.\nThis way, the overall training objective can be cast into a minimization problem w.r.t. pgen,\np\u2217gen = argmin pgen\u2208P E x\u223cpgen c\u2217(x; pgen)\u2212 E x\u223cpdata c\u2217(x; pgen)\n= argmin pgen\u2208P \u2211 x\u2208X [ pgen(x)\u2212 pdata(x) ] c\u2217(x; pgen)\n(21)\nwhere the second term of the first line is implicitly defined as the problem is an adversarial game between pgen and c. Proposition A.1. The global optimal of the EBGAN training objective is achieved if and only if pgen = pdata. At that point, c\u2217(x) is fully under-determined.\nProof. The proof is established by showing contradiction.\nFirstly, assume the optimal p\u2217gen 6= pdata. Thus, there must exist a non-equal setX6= = {x | pdata(x) 6= p\u2217gen(x)}, which can be further splitted into two subsets, the greater-than set X> = {x | p\u2217gen(x) > pdata(x)}, and the less-than set X< = {x | p\u2217gen(x) < pdata(x)}. Similarly, we define the equal set X= = {x : p\u2217gen(x) = pdata(x)}. Obviously, X> \u22c3 X< \u22c3 X= = X .\nLet L(pgen) = \u2211 x\u2208X [ pgen(x) \u2212 pdata(x) ] c\u2217(x; pgen), substituting the results from equation (20) into (21), the L(pgen)\u2217 can be written as\nL(p\u2217gen) = \u2211\nx\u2208X< \u22c3 X< \u22c3 X=\n[ p\u2217gen(x)\u2212 pdata(x) ] c\u2217(x; p\u2217gen)\n= \u2211 x\u2208X< [ p\u2217gen(x)\u2212 pdata(x) ] c\u2217(x; p\u2217gen) + \u2211 x\u2208X> [ p\u2217gen(x)\u2212 pdata(x) ] c\u2217(x; p\u2217gen)\n= m \u2211 x\u2208X> p\u2217gen(x)\u2212 pdata(x)\n> 0\n(22)\nHowever, when p\u2032gen = pdata, we have\nL(p\u2032gen) = 0 < L(p \u2217 gen) (23)\nwhich contradicts the optimal (miminum) assumption of p\u2217gen. Hence, the contradiction concludes that at the global optimal, p\u2217gen = pdata. By equation (20), it directly follows that c\n\u2217(x; p\u2217gen) = \u03b1x, which completes the proof."}, {"heading": "A.3 ANALYSIS OF ADDING ADDITIONAL TRAINING SIGNAL TO GAN FORMULATION", "text": "To show that simply adding the same training signal to GAN will not lead to the same result, it is more convenient to directly work with the formulation of f -GAN (Nowozin et al., 2016, equation (6)) family, which include the original GAN formulation as a special case.\nSpecifically, the general f -GAN formulation takes the following form\nmax c min pgen\u2208P E x\u223cpgen\n[ f?(c(x)) ] \u2212 E x\u223cpdata [ c(x) ] , (24)\nwhere the f?(\u00b7) denotes the convex conjugate (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004) of the f -divergence function. The optimal condition of the discriminator can be found by taking the variation w.r.t. c, which gives the optimal discriminator\nc\u2217(x) = f \u2032( pdata(x)\npgen(x) ) (25)\nwhere f \u2032(\u00b7) is the first-order derivative of f(\u00b7). Note that, even when we add an extra term L(pgen) to equation (24), since the term K(pgen) is a constant w.r.t. the discriminator, it does not change the result given by equation (25) about the optimal discriminator. As a consequence, for the optimal\ndiscriminator to retain the density information, it effectively means pgen 6= pdata. Hence, there will be a contradiction if both c\u2217(x) retains the density information, and the generator matches the data distribution.\nIntuitively, this problem roots in the fact that f -divergence is quite \u201crigid\u201d in the sense that given the pgen(x) it only allows one fixed point for the discriminator. In comparison, the divergence used in our proposed formulation, which is the expected cost gap, is much more flexible.

Thus, it usually takes much longer for the generator to learn to generate rare samples, and the training also proceeds much slower compared to the nearest neighbor based approximation.\nIn comparison, the nearest neighbor based gradient approximation is much more accurate as shown in 8b. As a result, it leads to more accurate energy contour, as well as faster training.

Hypothetically, if the discriminator does not degenerate, the extracted last-layer feature should maintain more information about the data points, especially compared to features from degenerated discriminators. Following this idea, we first train EGAN-Ent-NN, EGAN-Const, and GAN on the MNIST till convergence, and then extract the last-layer activation from their discriminator networks as fixed feature input. Based on fixed feature, a randomly initialized linear classifier is trained to do classification on MNIST. Based on 10 runs (with different initialization) of each of the three models, the test classification performance is summarized in Table 3. For comparison purpose, we also include a baseline where the input features are extracted from a discriminator network with random weights.\nBased on the proxy measure, EGAN-Ent-NN seems to maintain more information of data, which suggests that the discriminator from our proposed formulation is more informative.

It is tempting to consider the GAN discriminator as a candidate for providing this sort of scoring function. Conceptually, it is a trainable sample evaluation mechanism that \u2013 owing to GAN training paradigm \u2013 could be closely calibrated to the distribution modeled by the generator. If the discriminator could retain fine-grained information of the relative quality of samples, measured for instance by probability density or unnormalized energy, it could be used as an evaluation metric. Such data-driven evaluators would be highly desirable for problems where it is difficult to define evaluation criteria that correlate well with human judgment. Indeed, the real-valued discriminator of the recently introduced energy-based GANs Zhao et al. (2016) might seem like an ideal candidate energy function.", "startOffset": 40, "endOffset": 1943}, {"referenceID": 9, "context": "Taking this idea one step further, apprenticeship learning or imitation learning (Abbeel & Ng, 2004; Ziebart et al., 2008) aims at learning a policy (analogous to the generator) using the reward signals recovered by IRL.", "startOffset": 81, "endOffset": 122}, {"referenceID": 8, "context": "The GAN models most closely related to our proposed framework are energy-based GAN models of Zhao et al.

We derive the analytic form of the induced solution, and analyze its properties. In order to make the proposed framework trainable in practice, we introduce two effective approximation techniques.
