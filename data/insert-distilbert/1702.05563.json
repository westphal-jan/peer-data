The analysis of the resulting method reveals that holographic embedding and Trouillon et al.

For a vector v, [v] j represents the j th component of v. For a complex scalar z, vector z, and matrix Z, zT and ZT respectively denote the transpose of z and Z, and z, z, and Z their complex conjugate.\nLet x = [x0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 xn\u22121]T \u2208 Rn , y = [y0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 yn\u22121]T \u2208 Rn . Note that the vector indices start from 0 for notational convenience. The circular convolution of x and y, denoted by x\u2217y, is defined by\n[x\u2217y] j = n\u22121\u2211\nk=0 x[( j\u2212k) mod n] yk .

(2)\nWhile circular convolution is commutative, circular correlation is not; i.e., x\u2217 y = y\u2217 x, but x? y 6= y? x in general. As it can be verified with Eqs. (1) and (2), x? y = flip(x)\u2217 y, where flip(x) = [xn\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 x0]T is a vector obtained by arranging the components of x in reverse.\nFor n-dimensional vectors, naively computing circular convolution/correlation by Eqs. (1) and (2) requires O(n2) multiplications. However, we can take advantage of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to accelerate the computation: For circular convolution, first compute the DFTs of x and y, and then compute the inverse DFT of their elementwise vector product, i.e.,\nx\u2217y =F\u22121(F(x)\u00afF(y)),\nwhere F : Rn \u2192 Cn and F\u22121 : Cn \u2192 Rn respectively denote the DFT and inverse DFT, and \u00af denotes the elementwise product. Since DFT and inverse DFT can be computed in O(n logn) time with the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm, the computation time for circular convolution is also O(n logn). The same can be said of circular correlation. Since F(flip(x)) =F(x), we have\nx?y =F\u22121(F(x)\u00afF(y)).

In this section, we extend this technique further, and consider training HolE solely in the frequency domain. That is, real-valued embeddings ek ,wr \u2208 Rn in the original \u201ctime\u201d domain are abolished, and instead we train their DFT counterparts \u03b5k = F(ek ) \u2208 Cn and \u03c9k = F(wr ) \u2208 Cn in the frequency domain. This formulation eliminates the need of DFT/inverse DFT, which is the major computational bottleneck in HolE. In particular, the scoring function of Eq. (4) can be computed in O(n) time directly from \u03b5k and \u03c9k .\n1 Depending on the context, letter r is used either as an index to an element in R or the binary relation it signifies.\nIndeed, equivalent counterparts in the frequency domain exist for not only convolution/ correlation but all other computations needed for HolE: scalar multiplication, summation (needed when vectors are updated with stochastic gradient descent), and dot product (used in Eq. (4)). The frequency-domain equivalents for these operations are summarized in Table 1. All of these can be performed efficiently (in linear time) in the frequency domain.\nConcerning dot product, the following relation holds for x,y \u2208Rn :\nx \u00b7y = 1 n F(x) \u00b7F(y). (5)\nThis relation is known as Parseval\u2019s theorem (also called the power theorem (Smith, 2007)), and it states that dot products in two domains are equal up to scaling.\nAfter embeddings \u03b5k ,\u03c9r \u2208 Cn are learned in the frequency domain, their time-domain counterparts ek = F\u22121(\u03b5k ) and wr = F\u22121(\u03c9r ) can be recovered if needed, but this is not required as far as computation of the scoring function is concerned.

When we train HolE in the frequency domain, we could first generate a random real vector, regard them as a HolE vector in the time domain, and compute its DFT as the initial value in the frequency domain. An alternative, easier approach is to directly generate a random complex vector that is conjugate symmetric, and used it as the initial frequency vector. This guarantees the inverse DFT to be a real vector, i.e., there exists a valid corresponding image in the time domain.\nDuring the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training, vectors \u03c9r ,\u03b5s ,\u03b5o are updated respectively by \u03b1\u2207\u03c9r f ,\u03b1\u2207\u03b5s f ,\u03b1\u2207\u03b5o f , where \u03b1 \u2208 R is a factor not depending on these parameters, and\n\u2207\u03c9r f = \u03b5s \u00af\u03b5o , \u2207\u03b5s f =\u03c9r \u00af\u03b5o , \u2207\u03b5o f =\u03c9r \u00af\u03b5s .\nAs seen from above, conjugation, scalar multiplication, summation, and elementwise product are used in the SGD update. And it is easy to verify that all these operations preserve conjugate symmetry.

However, provided that the conjugate symmetry of these vectors are maintained, their dot product is always real. This follows from Parseval\u2019s theorem; the inverse DFTs of these frequency vectors are real, and thus their dot product is also real.

Moreover, \u03be0 (and \u03ben/2 if n is even) are real values.

(2016b) proposed a method for embedding-based knowledge graph completion, called complex embedding (CompE). The objective is the same as Nickel et al.\u2019s; the embedding ek of entities and wr of relations are to be learned. In their model, however, these vectors are complex-valued, and is based on eigendecomposition of complex matrices Xr = EWr ET that encodes r \u2208R among entities, where Xr \u2208C|E |\u00d7|E |, E = [e1, . . . ,e|E |]T \u2208C|E |\u00d7n , and Wr = diag(wr ) \u2208Cn\u00d7n is a diagonal matrix (with diagonal elements wr \u2208Cn). In practice,\nwe need Xr to be a real matrix, as its (r, s)-component defines the score for (r, s,o). To this end, they simply extracts the real part; i.e., Xr = Re(EWr ET), where Re(Z) denotes the real part of complex-valued matrix Z. Trouillon et al. (2016a) showed that any real matrix Xr can be expressed in this form.\nWith this formulation, the score for triple (r, s,o) is given by\nfCompE(r, s,o) = Re ( n\u22121\u2211\nj=0 [wr ] j [es] j [eo] j\n) .

(6), the scoring function for HolE. The complex embedding extracts the real part of complex dot product, whereas in our spectral version of HolE (spectral HolE), dot product is guaranteed to be real because all embeddings satisfy conjugate symmetry. Indeed, Eq. (6) can be equally written as\nfHolE(r, s,o) = 1\nn Re\n( \u03c9r \u00b7 (\u03b5s \u00af\u03b5o) ) ,\nThe Re(\u00b7) is redundant as the value is guaranteed to be real-valued, but this equation further elucidates the similarity between Eq. (6) and Eq. (8).\nAs argued in Section 4, the original HolE has an equivalent complex-valued embedding in spectral HolE, in the sense that their scoring functions always return the same score given the same triple. And as shown above, spectral HolE can be regarded as a special case of complex embedding trained with a specific form of initial vectors, i.e., conjugate symmetric vectors. It follows that a model that can be computed by HolE, either original or spectral, can also be computed by the complex embedding.\nConversely, given a complex embedding, we can construct an equivalent HolE, in the sense that fCompE(r, s,o) = c fHolE(r, s,o) for every r, s,o, where c > 0 is a constant. For each n-dimensional complex embeddings x \u2208 {ek }k\u2208E \u222a {wr }r\u2208R \u2282 Cn computed by a CompE, we make a corresponding HolE h(x) \u2208 R2n+1 as follows: For a given complex embedding x = [x0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7xn\u22121] \u2208Cn , first compute s(x) \u2208C2n+1 by\ns(x) = [0 x0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 xn\u22121 xn\u22121 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 x0 ]T\n= [0 x flip(x)]T (9)\nand then define h(x) =F\u22121(s(x)). Since s(x) is conjugate symmetric, h(x) is a real vector. This allows us to regard h(wr ),h(es),h(eo) \u2208 R2n+1 as holographic embeddings of r , s and o, and compute the score:\nfHolE(r, s,o) = h(wr ) \u00b7 (h(es)?h(eo))\n= 1 n s(wr ) \u00b7 (s(es)\u00afs(eo)) (\u2235 Eq.

We first consider a spectral version of the holographic embedding, exploiting the frequency domain in the Fourier transform for efficient computation. The analysis of the resulting method reveals that it can be viewed as an instance of the complex embedding with certain constraints cast on the initial vectors upon training. Conversely, any complex embedding can be converted to an equivalent holographic embedding.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
