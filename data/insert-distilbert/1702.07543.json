This sort of structured data can be interpreted by computers and applied in various fields such as information retrieval [Hoffmann et al., 2011] and word sense disambiguation [Pritsker et al., 2015]. Although powerful in representing structured data, the symbolic nature of relations makes KGs, especially large-scale KGs, difficult to manipulate. Predicting missing entries (known as link prediction) is of great importance in knowledge graph. To do this task, vector space embeddings of knowledge graphs have\nbeen widely adopted. The key idea is to embed entities and relation types of a KG into a continuous vector space.\nMany approaches have been proposed to learn embeddings of entities and relations, such as TransE [Bordes et al., 2013], NTN [Socher et al., 2013], HOLE [Nickel et al., 2015], ComplEx [Trouillon et al., 2016], and so on. They, however, only focus on knowledge triples, ignoring rich knowledge from logic rules. Logic rules are taken as complex formulae constructed by combining atoms with logical connectives. To leverage logic rules in knowledge graph embeddings, [Wang et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2015; Rocktschel et al., 2015; Shu et al., 2016] propose to utilize both knowledge triples and logic rules for KB completion. In their works, however, logic rules need to be grounded. Each rule needs to be instantiated with concrete entities. A rule can be grounded into plenty of ground rules, since there are many entities connected by the same relation type in logic rules. As a result, the works cannot scale well to larger KGs since rules will be grounded with more entities. And also, They all neglect the properties of transitivity and antisymmetry of rules.\nFor example, suppose we have two rules: \u201cCapitalOf \u21d2 LocatedIn\u201d and \u201cLocatedIn \u21d2 ContainedBy\u201d, which indicates the relation that x is a capital of y implies another relation that x is located in y, and the relation that x is located in y implies x is contained by y. Provided that we know Paris is a capital of France from the knowledge base, we can infer that Paris is located in France and contained by France as well, according to the transitivity of rules. In addition, even though we know Paris is located in France, we cannot infer that Paris is a capital of France according to the antisymmetry of rules: \u201cCapitalOf \u21d2 LocatedIn\u201d 6= \u201cLocatedIn \u21d2 CapitalOf\u201d.\nTo leverage the properties of transitivity and antisymmetry of rules, we propose a novel knowledge representation learning model to capture the ordering of relations, and infer potential new relations based on the ordering of existing relations and properties of transitivity and antisymmetry of rules. We integrate knowledge graphs, existing relations and logic rules together to learn the knowledge graph embeddings. Logic rules are incorporated into relation type representations directly, rather than instantiated with concrete entities. The embeddings learned are therefore compatible not only with triples but also with rules, and the embeddings of relation types are approximately ordered. We call our learn-\ning approach TARE, short for Embedding knowledge graphs based on Transitivity and Antisymmetry of Rules.\nIn the remainder of the paper, we first review previous work related to our work. Then we formulate our problem and present our learning algorithm in detail. After that we evaluate our approach by comparing our approach with exiting state-of-the-art algorithms. Finally we conclude the paper with future work."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Many works have made great efforts on modelling knowledge graphs. Some works explain triples via latent representation of entities and relations such as tensor factorization [Nickel et al., 2011; Riedel et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2014] and multiway neural networks [Socher et al., 2013]. The key of relational latent feature models is that the relationship between entities can be derived from interactions of their latent features. Many ways are discovered to model these interactions. RESCAL [Nickel et al., 2011] is a relational latent feature model which explains triples via pairwise interactions of latent features. However, it requires a large number of parameters. TransE [Bordes et al., 2013] translates the latent feature representations via a relation-specific offset. Both entities and relations are projected into the same continuous low-dimensional vector space and relations are interpreted as translating operations between head and tail entities. TransE is efficient when modelling simple relations. To improve the performance of TransE on complicated relations, TransH [Wang et al., 2014], TransR [Lin et al., 2015] and TransD [Zhao et al., 2015] are proposed. Unfortunately, these models miss simplicity and efficiency of TransE. To combine the power of tensor product with the efficiency and simplicity of TransE, HOLE [Nickel et al., 2015] uses the circular correlation of vectors to represent pairs of entities. Circular correlation has the advantage, comparing to tensor product, that it does not increase the dimensionality of the composite representation. However, due to the asymmetry of circular correlation, HOLE is unable to deal with symmetric relation. Complex [Trouillon et al., 2016] makes use of embeddings with complex value and is able to handle a large number of binary relations, in particular symmetric and antisymmetric relations.\nThese models perform the embedding task based solely on triples contained in a KG. Recent work put growing interest in logic rules. [Wang et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2015] tries to utilize rules via integer linear programming or Markov logical networks. However, rules are modeled separately from embedding models and will not help obtaining better embeddings. [Rocktschel et al., 2015] proposes a joint model which injects first-order logic into embeddings. This work focus on the relation extraction task and created vector embeddings for entity pairs rather than individual entities. As a result, relations between unpaired entities cannot be effectively discovered. KALE-Joint [Shu et al., 2016] proposes a new approach which learns entity and relation embeddings by jointly modelling knowledge triples and logic rules. However, all logic rules need to be grounded in these works, and thus they do not scale well to larger KGs. Also, the embed-\ndings of the relation types in rules are not ordered, and thus the transitivity and antisymmetry of logic rules are missed.\nTo address above issues, we propose a novel approach which learns embeddings by combining logic rules with knowledge triples. Logic rules are incorporated into relation type representations directly and the embeddings of relation types in logic rules are approximately ordered to leverage the transitivity and antisymmetry of rules."}, {"heading": "3 Problem Definition", "text": "In this section, we give a formal definition of the problem.

Ysro = 1 if (s, r, o) is positive. Otherwise, Ysro = \u22121.\nThe energy function \u03c6(s, r, o; \u0398) in our model is based on existing model Complex [Trouillon et al., 2016], in which complex vectors ve, vr \u2208 R\nd are learned for each entity e \u2208 E and each relation type r \u2208 R. It models the score of a triple as:\n(2)\n\u03c6(s, r, o) = Re(\u3008wreseo\u3009)\n= Re(\nd\u2211\ni=0\nwriesieoi)\n= d\u2211\ni=0\nRe(wri)Re(esi)Re(eoi)\n+\nd\u2211\ni=0\nIm(wri)Im(esi)Im(eoi)\n+\nd\u2211\ni=0\nIm(wri)Re(esi)Im(eoi)\n\u2212 d\u2211\ni=0\nIm(wri)Im(esi)Re(eoi)\nwhere wr, es, eo are complex vector embeddings for entities and relation types, Re(x) and Im(x) represent the real part and imaginary part of the complex vector embedding x, respectively. This function is antisymmetric when wr is purely imaginary (i.e.its real part is zero), and symmetric when wr is real. To approximately order the relation types in logic rules, we constrain the real part and imaginary part of the vector embeddings of relation types to be nonnegative and reduce the problem to Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). There are many ways to solve Non-negative Matrix Factorization such as Multiplicative Update [Lee and Seung, 2000], Gradient based Update [Lin, 2007] and Alternating Non-negative Least Squares [Kim and Park, 2007; Cichocki and Zdunek, 2007]. In our model, we adopt the approach which updates the embeddings based on gradient. Translate the general constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained optimization problem. The embeddings of relation types are translated into unconstrained complex vectors as follows:\nRe(wr) = Re(q) (2), Im(wr) = Im(q) (2) (3)\nwhere x(2) denotes the element-wise square of the vector x. In other words, Re(wri) = Re(qi) 2 and Im(wri) = Im(qi) 2. Plug eq.(3) into eq.(2) , we get a new energy function:\n(4)\n\u03c6(s, r, o) =\nd\u2211\ni=0\nRe(qi) 2Re(esi)Re(eoi)\n+\nd\u2211\ni=0\nIm(qi) 2Im(esi)Im(eoi)\n+ d\u2211\ni=0\nIm(qi) 2Re(esi)Im(eoi)\n\u2212\nd\u2211\ni=0\nIm(qi) 2Im(esi)Re(eoi)\nThe model is trained by minimizing the negative loglikelihood of the logistic model with L2 regularization on the\nparameters\u0398:\nLK = min \u0398\n\u2211 log(1+exp(\u2212Ysro\u03c6(s, r, o)))+\u03bb\u2016\u0398\u2016 2 (5)\nwhere \u03bb is the regularization parameter. The real part and imaginary part of complex vector q are both unconstrained. Therefore, the novel objective function can be solved by applying Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) directly. The negative set of knowledges is generated by local closed world assumption(LCWA) proposed in [Krompa et al., 2015]."}, {"heading": "4.2 Approximate Order Logic Model(AOLM)", "text": "In AOLM, We aim to embed relation types to capture the ordering between relations. We work on two kinds of logic rules: ra \u21d2 rb and ra \u2227 rb \u21d2 rc. Since there is no natural linear ordering on the set of complex numbers, we approximately order the complex vector embeddings by ordering the real part and imaginary part of the embeddings respectively. For their vector representations we require that the component-wise inequality holds:\nra \u21d2 rb if and only if\nd\u2227\ni=0\nRe(rai) 6 Re(rbi)\nand\nd\u2227\ni=0\nIm(rai) 6 Im(rbi) (6)\nand\nra \u2227 rb \u21d2 rc if and only if\nd\u2227\ni=0\nRe(rai)Re(rbi) 6 Re(rci)\nand d\u2227\ni=0\nIm(rai)Im(rbi) 6 Im(rci)\n(7)\nfor all vectors with non-negative coordinates, where \u2227\ndenotes the conjunction. Smaller coordinates imply higher position: ra \u21d2 rb if and only if all entries of the real part and imaginary part of the vector embedding of ra are less than or equal to that of rb. The penalty for an ordered pair (ra, rb) of a given logic rule ra \u21d2 rb is defined as follows:\n(8) F (ra, rb) = \u2016max(0, Re(ra)\u2212Re(rb))\n+max(0, Im(ra)\u2212 Im(rb))\u2016 2\nwheremax(0, x) returns the greater one by element between 0 and x. Crucially, if ra \u21d2 rb, F (ra, rb) = 0. F (ra, rb) is positive if ra \u21d2 rb is not satisfied. F (ra, rb) = 0 if and only ifmax(0, Re(ra)\u2212Re(rb)) = 0 andmax(0, Im(ra)\u2212 Im(rb)) = 0. That is, the real part of the embeddings of ra is less than or equal to that of rb, and the imaginary part of the embeddings of ra is less than or equal to that of rb. This satisfies the condition in eq.(6), and encourages the learned embeddings of relation types to satisfy the order properties of transitivity and antisymmetry. For example, if ra \u21d2 rb and rb \u21d2 rc, then ra \u21d2 rc, since \u2227d i=0 Re(rai) 6 Re(rbi) 6\nRe(rci) and \u2227d\ni=0 Im(rai) 6 Im(rbi) 6 Im(rci), then F (ra, rc) = 0. For logic rule ra \u2227 rb \u21d2 rc the penalty for (ra, rb, rc) is:\nF (ra, rb, rc) = \u2016max(0, Re(ra) \u2217Re(rb)\u2212Re(rc))\n+max(0, Im(ra) \u2217Re(rb)\u2212 Im(rc))\u2016 2\n(9)\nwhere \u2217 denotes the element-wise multiplication of two vectors. For a \u2217 b \u2208 Rd:\n[a \u2217 b]i = aibi (10)\nSimilarly, if ra \u2227 rb \u21d2 rc, F (ra, rb, rc) = 0. F (ra, rb, rc) is positive otherwise. F (ra, rb, rc) = 0 if and only if max(0, Re(ra)\u2217Re(rb)\u2212Re(rc)) = 0 andmax(0, Im(ra)\u2217 Im(rb)\u2212 Im(rc)) = 0. That is, the multiplication of the real part of the embeddings of ra and rb is less than or equal to that of rc, and the multiplication of the imaginary part of the embeddings of ra and rb is less than or equal to that of rc. This satisfies the condition in eq.(7). The set of all relation types in logic rules is the subset of all relation types in the given KG. Therefore, the relation types in logic rules are translated similarly to eq.(3):\nRe(ra|b|c) = Re(qa|b|c) (2), Im(ra|b|c) = Im(qa|b|c) (2) (11) To learn the approximate order-embedding of relation types in logic rules, we could use a max-margin loss. For rule ra \u21d2 rb:\n(12) LR = min\n\u2211\n(ra,rb)\u2208P\nF (ra, rb)\n+ \u2211\n(r\u2032 a ,r\u2032 b )\u2208N\nmax(0, \u03b1\u2212 F (r\u2032a, r \u2032 b))\nIf the rule is ra \u2227 rb \u21d2 rc:\n(13)\nLR = min \u2211\n(ra,rb,rc)\u2208P\nF (ra, rb, rc)\n+ \u2211\n(r\u2032 a ,r\u2032 b ,r\u2032 c )\u2208N\nmax(0, \u03b1\u2212 F (r\u2032a, r \u2032 b, r \u2032 c))\nwhere P andN denote the positive and negative sets of logic rules. If ra \u21d2 rb, we construct negatives by replacing rb in the consequent with a random relation r \u2208 R. If ra\u2227rb \u21d2 rc, we construct negatives by replacing rc in the consequent with a random relation r \u2208 R. \u03b1 is a hyper-parameter of margin. F (ra, rb), F (ra, rb, rc) is the penalty function score of positive logic rule, and F (r\u2032a, r \u2032 b), F (r \u2032 a, r \u2032 b, r \u2032 c) is that of negative logic rule calculated by eq.(8) or eq.(9). This loss encourages positive examples to have zero penalty, and negative examples to have penalty greater than a margin."}, {"heading": "4.3 Global Objective", "text": "With both knowledge triples and logic rules modelled, embeddings are learned by minimizing a global loss over this general representation:\nL = LK + LR (14)\nwhere LK is calculated by eq.(10) and LR is calculated by eq.(12) or eq.(13) . The embeddings of relation types are constrained to be non-negative, and are translated into unconstrained complex vector embeddings in loss function. Therefore, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in mini-batch mode and AdaGrad [Duchi et al., 2010] for tuning the learning rate can be used to carry out the minimization directly. Embeddings learned are able to be compatible with both triples and logic rules.

Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms called synsets. It provides short definitions and usage examples, and records a number of relations among these synonym sets or their members. WordNet can thus be seen as a combination of dictionary and thesaurus. The WN18 dataset is a subset of WordNet which contains 40,943 entities, 18 relation types and 151,442 binary triples. Since there are no logic rules among all relation types in WN18, we first add the reversed relations into training set. For example, * hypernym is the reversed relation type of hypernym. We add the triple (e1, \u2217 hypernym, e0) into training set according to the positive triple observed (e0, hypernym, e1). Then we can find some rules in newly generated training set. We create 14 implication rules. FB15k Freebase is a large-scale and growing collaborative KG which provides general facts of the real world. For example, the triple (Barack Obama, Spouse, Michelle Obama) describes there is a relation Spouse between Barack Obama and Michelle Obama. The FB15k dataset is a subset of Freebase which contains 14,951 entities, 1,345 relation types, and 592,213 triples. We use original training, validation and test set splits as provided by [Bordes et al., 2013]. We create 200 implication rules.

Each country is located in exactly one region and subregion, each subregion is located in exactly one region, and each country can have a number of neighbour countries.

Most existing methods only concentrate on knowledge triples, ignoring logic rules which contain rich background knowledge. Although there has been some work aiming at leveraging both knowledge triples and logic rules, they ignore the transitivity and antisymmetry of logic rules. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learn knowledge representations with entities and ordered relations in knowledges and logic rules. The key idea is to integrate knowledge triples and logic rules, and approximately order the relation types in logic rules to utilize the transitivity and antisymmetry of logic rules. All entries of the embeddings of relation types are constrained to be non-negative. We translate the general constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained optimization problem to solve the non-negative matrix factorization. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms other baselines on knowledge graph completion task. It indicates that our model is capable of capturing the transitivity and antisymmetry information, which is significant when learning embeddings of knowledge graphs.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
