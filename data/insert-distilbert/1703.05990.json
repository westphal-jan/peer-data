INTRODUCTION\nDigital pathology is opening new avenues for pathologists. Straightforward archiving, remote diagnostics and application of image analysis to improve efficiency of the diagnostic process are among the most commonly mentioned advantages of digital pathology [1].\nAlthough these advantages sound promising, a digital workflow comes with its own challenges. To generate diagnostic images, whole-slide scanners are used to digitize glass slides containing tissue specimens. Whole-slide scanners try to identify all the areas of tissue on the histopathological slides to decide which areas to scan and to determine the correct focus depth for those areas. However, it is well known that scanners can fail in detecting all tissue regions, for example due to the tissue type (e.g. fatty tissue), or due to weak staining (e.g. in immunohistochemistry). Missed regions can be hugely important for diagnostics, for example when pathologists are looking for cancer metastases in sentinel lymph nodes. Furthermore, accurate tissue segmentation is often an important first step in computerized analysis of digital pathology images.\nUnfortunately, there is no way to recover from errors made in tissue detection by slide scanners in later steps of the digital pathology workflow. The easiest solution, to scan every part\nof the slide completely, is not feasible in clinical practice, as it would increase the scan time and file size beyond reasonable limits. Currently, in many diagnostic settings a technician checks every slide after scanning for quality control. This is a tedious and expensive procedure, were the technician must manually identify the tissue areas in a coarse overview image and subsequently must re-scan those areas. As an alternative, we propose to use automated image analysis algorithms to identify tissue areas.\nSome groups have already tried to design methods to improve the tissue detection in scanners. Bug et al. used a method based on global thresholding at the mean value of the Gaussian blurred Laplacian of the grayscale image [2]. The result is subsequently refined via flood filling from identified background points. Hiary et al. built a different algorithm based on k-means clustering using pixel intensity, color and texture features [3].\nIn recent years, several papers have been published showing the potential of deep learning in digital histopathology [4][5][6]. These results motivated us to assess the value of deep learning in tissue segmentation in digital pathology.\nIn this paper, we compare the traditional image analysis method from Bug et al., a fully convolutional deep learning approach and a U-net based deep learning approach with respect to tissue segmentation accuracy [7]."}, {"heading": "2. MATERIALS", "text": "We used 54 histopathological whole slide images of four different tissue types with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and three different immunohistochemical staining with 3,3\u2019- Diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen and haemotoxylin counterstaining from three different laboratories (overview in Table 1). This allowed us to cover almost all use-cases and variations which one would encounter in regular clinical practice.\nThe images were scanned with 3DHistech Pannoramic 250 Flash and Hamamatsu NanoZoomer 2.0 HT C9600-13 whole-slide scanners and stored in vendor specific multiresolution format. Their size was approximately\n100000\u00d7220000 pixels with 0.24\u00d70.24 \u00b5m and 0.23\u00d70.23 \u00b5m pixel spacing respectively.\nThe tissue areas were manually annotated and we have divided the data set randomly into two groups of 27 images for two-fold cross validation. Each training fold was further subdivided into 19 + 8 images for training and validation respectively."}, {"heading": "3. METHODS", "text": "We implemented the Foreground Extraction from Structure Information (FESI) method as a traditional image analysis baseline [2]. Additionally, we trained two different convolutional neural networks for tissue-background segmentation. The first network is a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) while the second is based on the UNet network architecture (UCNN) [7].\nWe quantitatively compared the algorithms using the Jaccard index and we also performed a qualitative assessment to get an understanding of the type of errors the different algorithms make. The Jaccard index compares the tissue mask obtained from the algorithms to the manually annotated ground truth via the following equation:\n\ud835\udc3d(\ud835\udc34, \ud835\udc35) = |\ud835\udc34 \u2229 \ud835\udc35|\n|\ud835\udc34 \u222a \ud835\udc35| ,\nwhere A and B are the set of pixels labeled as tissue by two different segmentations.\nIn the following subsection, we will detail the methodology of the three algorithms."}, {"heading": "3.1. Foreground Extraction from Structure Information", "text": "The FESI algorithm was applied to the 5th resolution level of the multiresolution images where the pixel spacing was 7.68\u00d77.68 \u00b5m as it was published [2]. The color images were first converted to grayscale by summing the red, green and blue channels with 0.299, 0.587 and 0.114 weights respectively. The absolute value of the Laplacian was calculated for the grayscale images and blurred by a strong Gaussian filter with 15\u00d715 pixels kernel size and \ud835\udf0e = 4. An initial segmentation was calculated by applying a global\nthreshold at the mean intensity value of the blurred image. Then median blurring with 45\u00d745 pixels kernel size and morphological opening were used for further refining the initial mask. The morphological opening step consisted of 5 erosion followed by 5 dilation steps with a circular kernel with diameter of 7 pixels.\nNext, to remove holes from the tissue mask distance transformation was applied on the inverse of the initial segmentation and the point with the maximal value was used as seed point for flood filling the background. The selected point was the farthest away from the already identified tissue regions therefore it reliably belonged to the background.\nFinally, the small tissue regions were removed depending on their diameter and distance from large tissue blocks by calculating a distance transformation on the current tissue mask and iterating through the maxima. In each step the pixel with the maximal value of the distance image was taken as seed point. If the value of the seed point was larger than 100 or the seed point was closer than 100 pixels to any previously accepted seed point the point was added to the list of accepted seed points and its containing region was marked as tissue, otherwise the containing region was discarded from the tissue regions and marked as background."}, {"heading": "3.2. Fully convolutional neural network architecture", "text": "Our fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) consisted of 7 convolutional layers with filter sizes 5\u00d75 in the first two convolutional layers, 3\u00d73 on the third and fourth layers, 11\u00d711 on the fifth layer and 1\u00d71 on the last two layers. The number of filters were 16, 32, 64, 64, 1024, 512 and 2 respectively. Max pooling with 2\u00d72 pooling size and stride of 2 was inserted after each of the first three convolutional layers to reduce the memory requirements of the network."}, {"heading": "3.3. U-Net architecture", "text": "The U-Net architecture (UCNN) consisted of 7 steps. In each step, there were two consecutive convolutional layers with 3\u00d73 filter size. The number of filters was 32 at the first step, doubled in each step on the contraction side and halved at each step on the expansion size of the network. Each step except the last on the contraction side contained max pooling with 2x2 pooling size and stride of 2.\nWe used the weight matrix of the UCNN to prevent empty parts (i.e. not-scanned) in the whole slide images contributing to the error by setting the weight to 0 where the input patch of the network was empty and to 1 elsewhere."}, {"heading": "3.4 Network training", "text": "For regularization, we used batch normalization on all the convolutional layers for both networks. We also inserted two\ndropout layers after the last 3 contraction steps in UCNN with \ud835\udc5d = 0.5 dropout probability.\nWe used categorical cross entropy over softmax as loss and added the L2 loss for regularization with \ud835\udf06 = 2 \u2217 10\u22126 and \ud835\udf06 = 5 \u2217 10\u22127 weights for the FCNN and UCNN networks respectively.\nBoth networks were trained with RGB image patches that were randomly sampled from the images during training and validation.\nFor both networks the image patches were extracted from the 4th layer of the images where the pixel spacing was 3.84\u00d73.84 \u00b5m. The patches were 128\u00d7128 pixels for the FCNN. Each patch had a single label (tissue or background) based on the central pixel. For whole-slide segmentation the network was applied in a fully convolutional fashion to the image [8]. The inputs of the UCNN network were patches of 892\u00d7892 pixels and the outputs of the U-Net network was a 708\u00d7708 segmentation mask. The output of U-Net is smaller than the input due application of valid convolutions in the convolutional layers.\nTo augment the data set, we applied transformations on each of the extracted patches: mirroring the patch on the horizontal or vertical axis; rotating the patch with 90, 180 or 270 degrees clockwise; blurring the patch with a Gaussian filter with a \ud835\udf0e from the [0.1, 0.5] interval or applying gamma correction with \ud835\udefe from the [0.5, 1.5] interval. Each sampled patch was augmented 4 times with randomly selected augmentation method and parameter.\nEach epoch contained 100 training and 100 validation iterations for both networks. In each iteration, we extracted 100 + 100 image patches for the FCNN and 4 + 4 for the UCNN for training and validation. The measured epoch accuracy of the networks was the average accuracy of their validation iterations.\nThe initial learning rate was \ud835\udc59 = 5 \u2217 10\u22124 in both cases and it was halved if the accuracy did not improve in 10 epochs. The training stopped when the network did not improve its accuracy on the validation set for 50 consecutive epochs. The FCNN stopped after 172 and 165 epochs in the two folds respectively while the UCNN stopped after 196 and 137 epochs.\nWe used the Adam method for parameter optimization with the He method for initialization in both cases [9][10].\nWe also implemented a selective sampling method for the UCNN network architecture [11]. All the patches for training in the given epoch were pre-extracted from the slides. For each iteration in the epoch the patches for the training batches were selected randomly from this collection based on a\nprobability that was initialized to 1.0 and updated according to the output of the network. The selection probability update rule was \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59 = 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc4e, where \ud835\udc4e was the average classification accuracy given by the network for the patch. The best classified 90% of the patches were replaced with new ones at the end of the epochs.\nThe trained networks were applied to entire slides on a tileby-tile basis resulting in a tissue likelihood map. To generate the final binary segmentation mask, we applied Gaussian smoothing with \ud835\udf0e = 1.0 and thresholded the result at a likelihood of 0.5."}, {"heading": "4. RESULTS", "text": "To compare the different methods, we used the Jaccard index (JI). Summary statistics of the Jaccard index across all 54 slides are presented in Table 2 and Figure 1. Some qualitative segmentation results are shown in Figure 3. One can appreciate that both deep learning methods outperform the traditional method on average (JI of 0.929 and 0.937 vs. 0.870). More importantly, they also show less outliers and more stable results (JI standard deviation of 0.059 and 0.063 vs. 0.148).\nWe also performed a repeated measures ANOVA with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction to assess the statistical significance of the difference in performance. We found that the Jaccard index mean differed statistically significantly between FESI and the deep learning methods (\ud835\udc5d < 0.001). Although the mean Jaccard index of FCNN (0.937) was higher than of UCNN (0.929) no statistically significant difference was found (\ud835\udc5d = 0.18)."}, {"heading": "5. DISCUSSION", "text": "The proposed FCNN and UCNN method performed well on the data set; unlike the FESI algorithm the deep learning approaches performed well on different tissue types and stains from all three different laboratories. Although the overall performance of both deep learning algorithms was excellent, there were some difficult tissue areas where all methods made mistakes like fatty tissue areas under air bubbles (last column in Figure 2).\nWe compared our new methods to the existing FESI method and noticed that the Jaccard index differed significantly from the reported value in the original (0.95 in 34 out of 43 cases). This is probably because in our tests the algorithm was challenged with images from different laboratories and with differences in stains (e.g. we included immunohistochemistry). FESI results could probably be improved by changing parameters on a slide-by-slide basis, but this would essentially make it a semi-automatic method. Furthermore, slide-by-slide optimization is not needed for the deep learning algorithms.\nWe did not directly compare to the other published tissue segmentation methods by Hiary et al. [3]. They report their results as a localization error in which a pathologist partly determined which errors were relevant (and thus counted),\nmaking the approach irreproducible for us. Re-implementing this method was not feasible due to missing algorithmic details.\nTo further improve our algorithms, we would like to collect and annotate more slides. This would help to identify rare slide processing artifacts like air bubbles in tissue areas. We would also like to incorporate stain normalization methods to make the algorithms even more robust to staining and scanning differences. In our current implementation, we introduce the misclassified patches to the networks repeatedly. However, the spatial distribution of the difficult patches is not taken into account (e.g. the patch next to a difficult patch is probably also difficult). Considering it could further help the networks focus on challenging areas.\nThe computation time for the FCNN and UCNN was on average 2 and 4 minutes per slide, respectively. Those are larger than the 5 second execution time of FESI but still acceptable.\nConcluding, we proved the usability of two different deep learning methodologies in tissue segmentation of whole slide imaging and showed that they can significantly outperform the existing traditional image analysis algorithms.\n6.
