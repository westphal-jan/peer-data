INTRODUCTION\nPlacing sensors and beacons in a physical environment can assist robots and autonomous systems in understanding their surroundings. However, measurements from these devices provide only indirect or noisy information towards physical properties of interest, and require additional computational processing for inference. Such inference must take into account sources of degradation in the measurement process, as well as any other prior statistical knowledge of the environment. At the same time, the degree to which this inference succeeds is limited by how the beacons and sensors are distributed physically in the first place.\nConsider location-awareness, which is critical to enabling navigation by robots and humans, resource discovery, asset tracking, logistical operations, and resource allocation [1]. In situations for which GPS is unavailable (indoors, underground, or underwater) or impractical, measurements (e.g., range and bearing) relative to fixed beacons [2\u201311] provide an attractive alternative. Designing a system for beaconbased location-awareness requires simultaneously making the following design decisions: (a) how the beacons should be distributed (e.g., spatially and possibly across transmission channels); and (b) how location should be determined based on measurements from these beacons.\nNote that these decisions are inherently coupled. The placement of beacons and their channel allocation influence\nC. Schaff, A. Chakrabarti, and M.R.

One must therefore search over the space of both beacon placements (and possibly transmission channels) and inference strategies to find a pair that is jointly optimal. Unfortunately, due to phenomena such as noise, interference, and attenuation due to obstructions (e.g., walls), this search rarely has a closed-form solution in all but the most simplistic of settings.\nConsequently, most existing techniques decouple these decisions and rely upon approximations to make the search tractable. Beacon placement is typically performed either by relying on expert system designers to identify \u201cgood\u201d locations, by using heuristics (e.g., coverage), or according to the functionality of a particular inference method. For example, a simple approach is to assume that transmitters have a fixed sensing radius and to formulate placement as a solution to the art-gallery problem [12]. This formulation relies upon simplistic assumptions regarding the sensing geometry, and does not account for the effects of the environment (e.g., signal attenuation due to walls), noise, or interference.\nRecently, Chakrabarti [13] introduced a method that successfully uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to jointly learn sensor multiplexing patterns and reconstruction methods in the context of imaging. Motivated by this, we propose a new learning-based approach to designing the beacon distribution and inference algorithm jointly for the task of localization. We instantiate the inference method as a neural network, and encode the beacon distribution as a differ-\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n08 61\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.R O\n] 2\n4 M\nar 2\n01 7\nentiable neural layer. We show that the inference network and beacon layer can be jointly trained in combination with a general signal propagation model for an arbitrary environment, to automatically discover an optimized design for a location-awareness system in that environment.\nWe show that these designs yield localization accuracies that exceed hand-crafted approaches to beacon placement, and can be adjusted to trade-off location accuracy and the number of beacons. Our approach is general, and can be applied to produce localization systems without expert intervention for arbitrary environments and signal types."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "A great deal of attention has been paid within the robotics community and beyond to the problem of estimating location and other spatial phenomena using sensor networks. Existing work typically focuses either on the problem of inference for a given network or the task of choosing an optimal network allocation for a given inference strategy. While the following discussion focuses on localization within a network of beacons, many of the concepts apply to the more general problem of estimating spatial phenomena using sensor networks.\nA common approach to localization within existing radio frequency (RF)-based beacon networks is to use the Received Signal Strength (RSS) as a fingerprint that is matched against a database of RSS-location pairs in order to determine the receiver\u2019s location [14]. This database is typically generated via a manually performed site-survey, though there has been work to generate this map automatically or \u201corganically\u201d during operation [15, 16]. In similar fashion to our inference model, Sala et al. [17] use a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict a receiver\u2019s location within an existing network based upon Received Signal Strength. Altini et al. [18] take a similar approach for networks that employ Bluetooth for communication.\nMany beacon networks provide direct, albeit noisy, measurements of inter-node range or bearing. For example, acoustic long baseline (LBL) networks are frequently used to localize underwater vehicles [3, 4], while a number of lowcost systems exist that use RF and ultrasound to measure range [19, 20]. Moore et al. [21] propose an algorithm for estimating location based upon noise-corrupted range measurements, formulating the problem as one of realizing a two-dimensional graph whose structure is consistent with the observed ranges. Detweiler et al. [7] propose a geometric technique that estimates a robot\u2019s location as it navigates a network of fixed beacons using either range or bearing observations. Kennedy et al. [10] employ spectral methods to localize camera networks using angular measurements, without the need for a global coordinate frame. Alternatively, Shareef et al. [22] evaluate the use of feedforward and recurrent neural network architectures to localize a receiver based upon noisy range measurements.\nMeanwhile, beacon allocation traditionally relies on coverage as a heuristic to guide the placement of beacons in a particular environment. When beacons are assumed to\nhave a fixed transmission radius, the art-gallery problem [12] provides a reasonable formulation of the coverage problem. However, a beacons\u2019s field-of-view is typically not fixed and is instead a function of the layout and composition of the environment, beacon noise, and signal interference, which itself varies according to the placement of other beacons. Agarwal et al. [23] propose a greedy landmark-based method that solves for the placement of minimum number of beacons (within a log factor) necessary to cover all but a fraction of a given polygonal environment.\nWhen the inferred phenomena is modeled using a Gaussian process (GP), a common technique is to greedily introduce sensors at the location with the highest entropy under the GP [24, 25]. However, this approach does not model the accuracy of the predictions at the selected locations. Alternatively, Krause et al. [26] consider the problem of choosing the location for a fixed sensor network that maximizes mutual information using a Gaussian process model for phenomena over which inference is performed (e.g., temperature). They show that this problem is NP-complete and propose a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that exploits the submodularity of mutual information to provide placements that are within a constant-factor of the optimal locations. Similarly, Cameron and Durrant-Whyte [27] use mutual information in order to determine sensor placement for localization and recognition tasks. Meanwhile, Fang and Lin [28] consider localization accuracy when placing wireless access points and choose locations that maximize signal-to-noise ratio. In similar fashion to our proposal to learn sensor placement via backpropagation, Kang et al. [29] propose using a neural network to determine the placement of WiFi access points.\nIn many scenarios, beacon allocation includes both choosing where to place beacon in a given environment as well as which channel to assign to each beacon. These problems are typically decoupled\u2014the location of each beacon is first determined and then their channels are chosen in order to minimize interference [30] This can result in a sub-optimal allocation. Ling and Yeung [31] jointly solve access point placement and channel selection using local search.\nMeanwhile, the sensor selection problem [32, 33] considers related scenarios in which there is a cost associated to querying sensors. The problem is to choose the subset of sensors to utilize at each point in time so as to balance inference accuracy with the corresponding query cost. Also related is the task of choosing where to place cellular towers, which is driven by multiple objectives including coverage, signal-to-noise ratio, and cost and often involves extensive manual site surveys, high-fidelity simulations, and handdesigned placement strategies [34]."}, {"heading": "III. APPROACH", "text": "We formalize the design problem for a location-awareness system as that of determining an optimal distribution of beacons D and an inference function f(\u00b7), given an environment E . For a given set of L possible locations for beacons, we parameterize the distribution D as an assignment Il to each\nlocation l \u2208 {1, . . . L}, where Il \u2208 {0, 1}C+1, |Il| = 1 is a (C+1)-dimension 0-1 vector with all but one entry equal to 0. This vector denotes whether to place a beacon at location l (otherwise I1l = 1), and if so, in which one of C possible configurations (i.e., Ic+1l = 1 for configuration c).\nWe parameterize the environment in terms of a function s = E(v, {Il}), which given a location v \u2208 R2 and a distribution of beacons D = {Il}, produces a vector s \u2208 Rm of measurements that an agent is likely to make at that location. Note that the environment E need not be a deterministic function. In case of probabilistic phenomena such as noise and interference, E will produce a sample from the distribution of possible measurements. The inference function f(\u00b7) is then tasked with computing a reliable estimate of the location, given these measurements.\nOur goal is to jointly optimize D = {Il} and f(\u00b7) to minimize the average value of the Euclidean distance between the estimated and true locations, over a distribution of possible locations where the agent may visit. Additionally, we add a regularizer to our objective, e.g., to minimize the total number of individual beacons. Figure 2 provides a schematic overview of our problem formulation."}, {"heading": "A. Optimization with Gradient Descent", "text": "Unfortunately, the problem as stated above involves a combinatorial search, since the space of possible beacon distributions is discrete with (C + 1)L elements. We make the optimization tractable by adopting an approach similar to that of Chakrabarti [13]. We relax the assignment vectors Il to be real-valued and positive as I\u0303l \u2208 RC+1+ , |I\u0303l| = 1. I\u0303l can be interpreted as a probability distribution over the possible assignments at location l.\nInstead of optimizing over distribution vectors I\u0303l directly,\nwe learn a weight vector wl \u2208 RC+1 with\nI\u0303l = SoftMax(\u03b1wl), I\u0303cl = exp(\u03b1wcl )\u2211 c\u2032 exp(\u03b1w c\u2032 l ) , (1)\nwhere \u03b1 is a positive scalar parameter. Since our goal is to arrive at values of I\u0303l that correspond to hard assignments, we begin with a small value of \u03b1 and increase it during the course of optimization according to an annealing schedule. Small values of \u03b1 in initial iterations allow gradients to be back-propagated across Eqn. 1 to update {wl}. As optimization progresses, increasing \u03b1 causes the distributions {Il} to get \u201cpeakier\u201d, until they converge to hard assignments.\nWe also define a distributional version of the environment mapping E\u0303(v, {I\u0303l}) that operates on these distributions instead of hard-assignments. This mapping can be interpreted as producing the expectation of the signal vector s at location v, where the expectation is taken over the distributions {I\u0303l}. We require that this mapping be differentiable with respect to the distribution vectors {I\u0303l}. In the next sub-section, we will describe an example of an environment mapping, and its distributional version that satisfies this requirement.\nNext, we simply choose the inference function f(\u00b7) having some parametric form (e.g., a neural network), and learn its parameters jointly with the weights {wl} of the beacon distribution as the minimizers of a loss function:\nL({wl},\u0398) = R({I\u0303l})+ 1 \u2016V\u2016 \u2211 v\u2208V E s \u2225\u2225\u2225v \u2212 f (E\u0303 (v, I\u0303l}l) ; \u0398)\u2225\u2225\u22252 , (2) where V is the set of possible agent locations, \u0398 are the parameters of the inference function f , I\u0303l =SoftMax(\u03b1wl), as \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e, and R is a regularizer. Note that the inner expectation in the second term of Eqn. 2 is with respect to the distribution of possible signal vectors for a fixed location and beacon distribution, and captures the variance in measurements due to noise, interference, etc.\nWe minimize Eqn. 2 with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) computing gradients over a small batch of locations v \u2208 V , with a single sample of s per location. We find that the quadratic schedule for \u03b1 used by Chakrabarti [13] works well, i.e., we set \u03b1 = \u03b10(1 + \u03b3t2) at iteration t."}, {"heading": "B. Application to RF-based Localization", "text": "To give a concrete example of an application of this framework, we consider the following candidate setting of localization using RF beacons. We assume that each beacon transmits a sinusoidal signal at one of C frequencies/channels. The amplitude of this signal for every beacon is assumed to be fixed, but we allow different beacons to have arbitrary phase variations amongst them.\nWe assume an agent at a location has a receiver with multiple band-pass filters, and is able to measure the power in each channel separately (i.e., m = C). We assume that the power of each beacon\u2019s signal drops as a function of distance, and of the number of obstructions (e.g., walls) in the line-of-sight between the agent and the beacon. The\nmeasured power at the receiver in each channel is then based on the amplitude of the super-position of signals from all beacons transmitting in that channel. This superposition is a source of interference, since individual beacons have arbitrary phase. We also assume that there is some measurement noise at the receiver.\nWe assume all beacons transmit at power P0, and model the power of the attenuated signal received from beacon l at location v as\nPl(v) = P0 r \u2212\u03b6 l:v \u03b2 ol:v , (3)\nwhere \u03b6 and \u03b2 are scalar parameters, rl:v is the distance between v and the beacon location l, and ol:v is the number of walls/obstructions intersecting the line between them. The measured power s = E(v, {Il}) in each channel at the receiver is then modeled as:\nsc = [ 1 +\n\u2211 l Ic+1l \u221a Pl(v) cos\u03c6l ]2 +[\n2 + \u2211 l Ic+1l \u221a Pl(v) sin\u03c6l\n]2 , (4)\nwhere \u03c6l is the phase of beacon l, and 1 and 2 correspond to sensor noise. We also model sensor saturation by clipping sc at some threshold \u03c4 . At each invocation of the environment function, we randomly sample the phases {\u03c6l} from a uniform distribution between [0, 2\u03c0), and noise terms 1 and 2 from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with variance \u03c32z .\nFor training, the distributional version of the environment function E\u0303 is constructed simply by replacing Il with I\u0303l in Eqn. 4. For regularization, we use a term that penalizes the\ntotal number of beacons with a weight \u03bb: R({I\u0303l}) = \u03bb \u2211 l I\u03031l . (5)\nThis setting simulates an environment that is complex enough to not admit closed-form solutions for the inference function or the beacon distribution. Of course, there may be other phenomena in certain applications, such as leakage across channels, multi-path interference, etc., that are not modeled here. However, these too can be incorporated in our framework as long as they can be modeled with an appropriate environment function E ."}, {"heading": "IV. RESULTS", "text": "In this section, we evaluate our method through a series of simulation-based experiments on two different environment maps, learning a neural network for the inference function.\nFor each map, we consider several manual beacon distributions, and show that the network architecture we choose is able to localize effectively given these distributions, by comparing its results to a simple nearest-neighbors baseline. Then, we show results from learning the beacon distribution and inference network jointly, and show that for both environments, our method learns a more optimal distribution strategy that leads to better localization accuracy.\nWe end the section by providing the reader with an analysis of the effects of different degrees of regularization, as well as the variation in the learned distributions based on parameters of the environment function E ."}, {"heading": "A. Experimental Setup", "text": "We conduct our experiments on two manually drawn environment maps, which correspond to floor plans (of size\n1\u00d70.7 distance units) with walls serving as obstructions. For each map, we arrange L = 625 possible beacon locations in a 25 \u00d7 25 evenly spaced grid. We consider configurations with values of C = 4, 8, and 16 RF-channels.\nOur experiments use the environment model defined in Eqn. 3 with P0 = 6.25 \u00d7 10\u22124, \u03b6 = 2.0 (where locations are in map units), and \u03b2 = e\u22121.0, with sensor noise variance \u03c32z = 10\n\u22124. The sensor measurements are saturated at a threshold \u03c4 = 1.0\nWhile training the beacons, we use parameters \u03b10 = 1 and for the quadratic temperature scheme \u03b3 = 1.25\u00d7 10\u22129. These values were chosen empirically, so that the beacon selection vectors I\u0303l converge at the same pace as it takes the inference network to learn (as observed while training on a fixed beacon distribution). After 9\u00d7105 iterations, we switch the softmax to an \u201carg-max\u201d, effectively setting \u03b1 to infinity and fixing the beacon placement, and continue training the inference network.\nAs mentioned above, the inference function f(\u00b7) is parameterized as a 13-layer feed-forward neural network. Our architecture consists of 6 blocks of 2 fully-connected layers. All hidden layers contain 1024 units, and are followed by ReLU activation. Each block is followed by a max pooling operation applied on disjoint sets of four units. After the final block, there is a final output layer with 2 units that predicts the x, y location coordinates.\nDuring training, locations are randomly sampled and fed through our environment model to the inference network in batches of 1000. All networks were trained by minimizing the loss defined in Eqn. 2 for 106 iterations using SGD with a learning rate of 0.01 and momentum 0.9. We also use batch-normalization in all hidden layers."}, {"heading": "B. Experiments", "text": "We evaluate the effectiveness of our inference network, as well as of the joint optimization of beacon placement and localization. To that end, we compare our method with two baselines. First, we compare our inference network with a kNearest Neighbor (kNN) baseline using hand-crafted beacon placements. The training data for the kNN experiments was compiled by sampling from our environment model on a dense grid for each map. We ran experiments with k = 1, 5, 10, and 20, comparing our model to the best k for each beacon placement. We measure the performance of each model with both root mean squared error (RMSE) and the mean over max errors at each location, which we refer to as Max Error. The effect of interference on performance can vary greatly between different beacon placements. Therefore it is useful to measure both average-case performance as well as the worst-case performance, as some placements may be more susceptible to interference.\nWe compare these results to jointly learned models on both maps. Tables I and II present the results for Map 1 and Map 2, respectively, where we include the bestperforming baselines. Figure 3 displays the beacon placement and channel allocation along with the RMSE for both learned and hand-crafted beacon allocations.

Note that the images depict a hard assignment, however the network is reasoning over high entropy placements early in training, which explains the initial sparsity. With both maps, the network quickly clusters a large number of beacons by channel, and gradually learns to reduce the number of beacons and increase channel diversity, converging to a stable configuration. The results reveal that our inference network can effectively learn to localize the agent given a fixed beacon placement. They also demonstrate that learning this placement yields accuracies that exceed those of hand-crafted placements while using significantly fewer beacons. Note that hand-crafted placements with fewer beacons performed significantly worse.\nIn practice, placing beacons will often have a monetary cost. To allow for a trade-off between the number of beacons placed and accuracy, we consider the regularization scheme defined in Eqn. 5. In our experiments, we vary \u03bb between 0.0 and 0.2. As Figure 4 shows, we find that increased regularization leads to solutions with fewer beacons. On Map 2, we find that decreased regularization always leads to solutions with lower error. On Map 1, however, we find that unregularized beacon placements result in increased localization error. This regularization may also allow our model to escape bad local minima during training.\nAdditionally, we also experiment with an annealing scheme for \u03bb and find that it empirically improves performance. We use a simple annealing schedule that decays \u03bb by a constant factor \u03b7 every 100,000 iterations. We experiment with initial \u03bb = 0.2 and \u03b7 \u2208 {0.25, 0.5}.

Table IV presents the results. We find that our method adapts to these changes intuitively. Our method places fewer beacons when the signal passes largely unattenuated through walls and places more beacons when combating increased noise. Lastly, we experiment with 4 and 16 channels.

operations. In settings where GPS is unavailable, rangeor bearing-only observations relative to a set of fixed beacons provide an effective means of estimating a robot\u2019s location as it navigates. The accuracy of such a beacon-based localization system depends both on how beacons are spatially distributed in the environment, and how the robot\u2019s location is inferred based on noisy measurements of range or bearing. However, it is computationally challenging to search for a placement and an inference strategy that, together, are optimal. Existing methods decouple these decisions, forgoing optimality for tractability. We propose a new optimization approach to jointly determine the beacon placement and inference algorithm. We model inference as a neural network and incorporate beacon placement as a differentiable neural layer. This formulation allows us to optimize placement and inference by jointly training the inference network and beacon layer. We evaluate our method on different localization problems and demonstrate performance that exceeds hand-crafted baselines.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
