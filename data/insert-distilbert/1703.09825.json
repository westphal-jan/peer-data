Sentiment analysis is useful for a variety of important applications, such as recommendation system, virtual assistants, and health informatics. Much SA relies on lexicons mapping words to sentiment, which are either manually annotated or automatically generated from a small set of seed words. Many researchers and companies have explored methods of expanding and re-generating sentiment lexicons to reduce the cost of manual annotation and to compensate for the lack of existing annotated data and the dynamic and\nfluctuating nature of human emotion. However, most sentiment lexicon expansion methods attach a polarity value (i.e., negative, positive, or neutral) (Stone et al., 1968) or real-valued onedimensional scores (Baccianella et al., 2010) to the words. It is well known; however, that one dimension is insufficient to adequately characterise the complexity of emotion (Fontaine et al., 2007).\nIn a large set of cross-cultural studies in the 1950s, Osgood showed that concepts carried a culturally dependent, shared affective meaning that could be characterised to a great extent using three simple dimensions of evaluation (good versus bad), potency (powerful versus powerless), and activity (lively versus quiet) (Osgood, 1957). This semantic differential scale of evaluation, potency, and activity (EPA) is thought to represent universal and cross-cultural dimensions of affective meaning for words.\nBased on this work, several three-dimensional sentiment lexicons have been manually labeled using surveys in different countries (Heise, 2010). Words in these lexicons are measured on a scale from \u22124.3 (infinitely bad, powerless, or inactive) to +4.3 (infinitely good, powerful, or lively) (Berger and Zelditch, 2002; Heise, 2007).1 In these surveys, participants are asked to rate identities (e.g., teacher, mother), behaviors (e.g., help, coach), adjectives (e.g., big, stubborn), institutions (e.g., hospital, school) or scenarios (e.g. combinations of identities, behaviours, adjectives and institutions) (Heise, 2010) on 5- item scales ranging from \u201dInfinitely negative (e.g., bad/powerless/inactive)\u201d to \u201dInfinitely positive (e.g., good/powerful/active)\u201d, which are then mapped to the [\u22124.3, 4.3] scale. These man-\n1The range [\u22124.3, 4.3] is a historical convention\nual annotation methods are labor-intensive, timeconsuming and they produce a relatively small number of words.\nIn this paper, we utilize the semantic and distributed words representation to expand these three-dimensional sentiment lexicons in a semisupervised fashion. We also evaluated four different approaches of computing the affinity matrix using a semantic (dictionary-based) features, singular value decomposition word embedding, neural word embedding word vector, and combining both neural word embedding and semantic features. The highest results were obtained using the semantic and neural word embedding model with a rank correlation score \u03c4 = 0.51 on recreating two sentiment lexicon (Warriner et al., 2013) and the General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1968). The results also show that the highest rank correlation scores of the three dimension were for evaluation (E) while the lowest were for the potency (P). We also evaluated our induced EPA scores against some of the state-of-the-art methods in lexicon expansion, and our method shows an improvement in the \u03c4 correlation and F1 score over these algorithms.\nOur contributions are fivefold: 1) this is the first work that extensively examines methods of multidimensional lexicon expansion (we compute the evaluation, potency, and activity (valence, dominance, and arousal) scores instead of only computing the evaluative factor ( valence), 2) we propose a label propagation algorithm that is built upon both the semantic and distributed word representations, 3) we performed a comprehensive evaluation of four algorithms against a manually annotated dataset as well as a supervised learning algorithm, 4) we sample seed words from the corpus or dictionary instead of using the commonly used fixed seed words (e.g., good, bad, happy, sad etc.), 5) we created a significantly large threedimensional lexicon of \u223c 3M words that could be leveraged by researchers in fields of sentiment analysis and social science.\nOur proposed approaches 1) reduce the cost of manual annotation of sentiment lexicons; 2) integrate the affective meaning of today\u2019s\u2019 growing vocabulary (e.g., selfie, sexting), and 3) identify and incorporate the variance in attitudes towards words (e.g., same-sex marriage, abortion)."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "The lexicon augmentation methods in this study were performed using variations of word representations and similarity metrics. This section provides a short background about the various vector space models that are used."}, {"heading": "2.1 Statistical language modeling", "text": "Statistical language model (or vector space model (VSM)) is a distributional estimation of various language phenomena estimated by employing statistical techniques on real world data. Representing language phenomena in terms of parameters has proven to be useful in various natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, and information retrieval (IR) tasks. To capture the semantic or syntactic properties and represent words as proximity in n-dimensional space, several VSMs have been proposed ranging from the simple onehot representation that regards words as atomic symbols of the co-occurrence with other words in a vocabulary to a neural word embedding that represents words in a dense and more compact representation.\nThe most commonly used word representation is the distributional word embeddings representing word based on the co-occurrence statistics with other words in a document or corpora (Harris, 1981; Firth, 1957). The dimensionality of this sparse representation can be reduced using Singular value decomposition (Eckart and Young, 1936), Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) or Principal Component Analysis (Jolliffe, 2002).\nNeural word embeddings has recently gained a lot of attention in NLP and deep learning. Neural word embeddings represent words in a lowdimensional, continuous space where each dimension corresponds to semantic or syntactic latent features. Similar to distributional word embeddings, neural word embeddings are usually based upon co-occurrence statistics, but they are more compact, less sensitive to data sparsity, and able to represent an exponential number of word clusters (Bengio et al., 2006) (Mikolov et al., 2010, 2011)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Acquisition of Sentiment Lexicon", "text": "Similar to other NLP tasks, sentiment lexicon induction methods can be achieved using two main approaches corpus-based or thesaurus-\nbased. Turney and Littman (Turney et al., 2003) proposed a corpus-based lexicon learning method by first applying (TF-IDF) weighting on matrices of words and context, using SVD, and then computing the semantic orientation with a set of seed words.\nThesaurus-based methods use the lexical relationship such as the depth of a concept in taxonomy tree (Wu and Palmer, 1994) or edge counting (Collins and Quillian, 1969) to build sentiment lexicons. Similar to Turney\u2019s PMI approach (KAMPS, 2004) they use WordNet based relatedness metric between words and given seed words.\nSemi-supervised graph-based models that propagate information over lexical graphs have also been explored. The polarity-propagation or sense propagation algorithm induces sentiment polarity of unlabeled words given seed words (positive, negative) and the lexical relationships between them (e.g., word-net synonym, antonym) (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). Some researchers have developed a weighted label propagation algorithm that propagates a continuous sentiment score from seed words to lexically related words (Godbole et al., 2007). Velikovich et al. (Velikovich et al., 2010) proposed web-based graph propagation to elicit polarity lexicons. The graph is built upon a co-occurrence frequency matrix and cosine similarity (edges) between words and seed words (nodes). Then, both a positive and a negative polarity magnitude will be computed for each node in the graph which is equal to the sum over the max weighted path from every seed word (either positive or negative).\nSeveral recent studies have utilized word embeddings to generate sentiment lexicons, such as a regression model that uses structured skipgram 600 word embedding to create a Twitterbased sentiment lexicon (Astudillo et al., 2015). Another study transforms dense word embedding vectors into a lower dimensional (ultradense) representation by training a two objective function gradient descent algorithms on lexicon resources (Rothe et al., 2016). A recent study has also proposed a label propagation based model that uses word embedding, built using singular value decomposition (SVD) and PMI, to induce a domain-specific sentiment lexicon (Hamilton et al., 2016).\nFew studies have looked at multidimen-\nsional sentiment lexicon expansion. Kamps et al. (KAMPS, 2004) use a WordNet-based metric to elicit semantic orientation of adjectives. The generated lexicon was evaluated against the manually constructed list of Harvard IV-4 General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1968). Kamps et al.\u2019s work focuses only on adjectives and assigns them a binary value (either good or bad, potent or impotent, etc.). A three-dimensional sentiment lexicon was extended using a thesaurus-based label propagation algorithm based upon WordNet similarity (Alhothali and Hoey, 2015), and their results were compared against the Ontario dataset (MacKinnon, 2006)."}, {"heading": "3 Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Graph-based Label-Propagation", "text": "Expanding sentiment lexicons using graph-based propagation algorithms was pursued previously and found to give higher accuracy in comparison with other standard methods (Hu and Liu, 2004; Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009). To evaluate the effectiveness of graph-based approaches in expanding multidimensional sentiment lexicons, in this paper, we use the label propagation algorithm (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002; Zhou et al., 2004), combined with four methods for computing words vectors and word similarities. The label propagation algorithms rely on the idea of building a similarity graph with labeled (seed words/paradigm words) and unlabeled nodes (words). The labels or scores of the known nodes (words) are then propagated through the graph to the unlabeled nodes by repeatedly multiplying the weight matrix (affinity matrix) against the labels or scores vector.\nFollowing the same principle, the graph label propagation algorithm in this paper: 1) creates a set of labeled L = (Xl, Yl) and unlabeled data points or words U = (Xu, Yu) where |U |+ |L| = |V |, V is all the words in the vocabulary set, X is the word, and Y is the sentiment (E, P, A scores) attached to that word; 2) constructs an undirected weighted graph G = {E,V,W} where V is a set of vertices (words), E edges, W is an |V | \u00d7 |V | weight matrix ( where wij \u2265 0); 3) Compute the random walk normalized Laplacian matrix \u2206 = D\u22121W (where D is the degree matrix); 4) initializes the labeled nodes/words Yl with their EPA values, and the unlabeled nodes/words Yu with ze-\nroes; 4) propagates the sentiment scores to adjacent nodes by computing Y \u2190 \u2206Y (weighted by a factor \u03b1) and clamps the labeled nodes Yl to their initial values L after each iteration.\nWe implemented the label propagation algorithm using four different methods of computing affinity matrix and word representations. First, a semantic lexicon-based approach in which the graph is built based upon the semantic relationship between words (Semantic lexicon-based Label propagation or SLLP). Second, a distributional based approach in which vocabulary and weights come from co-occurrence statistics in a corpus (corpus-based label propagation or CLP). Third, a neural word embeddings method (neural word embedding label propagation or NWELP), and fourth, a combination of semantic and distributional methods (semantic neural word embedding label propagation or SNWELP).

Two semantic lexicons were used in this algorithm: WordNet dictionary (WN) (Miller, 1995) and the paraphrase database (PPDB) (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013). The SLLP algorithm constructs the vocabulary V from the words of the dictionaries and computes and normalizes the weight matrix W using the synonyms relationship between words. The semanticbased similarity wi,j of any pair of words xi and xj in the vocabulary V is calculated as follows:\nwi,j =\n{\n1.0 if xj is a synonym of xi 0.0 otherwise (1)"}, {"heading": "3.1.2 Corpus-based Label Propagation (CLP)", "text": "Corpus-based label propagation (CLP) is one of the most commonly used methods for sentiment lexicon generation that uses the co-occurrence statistics aggregated from different corpora (news articles, Twitter, etc.) to build the similarity graph in the label propagation algorithms. We used an n-gram features from the signal media (SM) one million news articles dataset which contains\n\u223c 265K blog articles and \u223c 734K news articles (Corney et al., 2016) and the North American News (NAN) text corpus (Graff, 1995) which has \u223c931K articles from a variety of news sources.\nThe co-occurrence matrix R was computed on a window size of four words. Bigrams with stop words, words less than three letters, proper nouns, non-alpha words, and the bigrams that do not occur more than ten times were filtered out. These heuristics reduce the set into \u223c 80k and \u223c 40k, for SM and NAN corpora, respectively. We constructed the word vectors by computing the smoothed positive point-wise mutual information(SPPMI) (Levy et al., 2015) of the co-occurrence matrix R. This smoothing technique reduces the PMI\u2019s bias towards rare words and found to improve the performance of NLP tasks (Levy et al., 2015).\nSPPMIij = max{(log2 p(wi,wj)\np(wi)p\u03b1(wj) ,0)}\n(2)\nwhere p(wi,wj) is the empirical co-occurrence probability of a pair of words wi and wj and p(wi) and p\u03b1(wj) are the marginal probability of wi and the smoothed marginal probability of wj, respectively.

We use the (Warriner et al., 2013) dictionary in the lexicon induction procedure by sampling the paradigm words from it and we compare the generated lexicon against it. We randomly divided the (Warriner et al., 2013) affective dictionary (original-EPA) into EPA-training (third of the set equal to 5566 words) and EPA-testing (two-thirds of the set equal to 8349 words). The seed words for all algorithms are sampled from the EPA-training set only, and all results are presented on the EPA-testing set.\nThe EPA scores of (Warriner et al., 2013) initially range \u2208 [1, 9] and we rescaled them to \u2208 [\u22124.3,+4.3] to follow the same EPA scale used in the other lexicons we have considered (Heise, 2010). The [\u22124.3,+4.3] scale is the standard scale used by most of the researchers in the sociology field who study or measure individuals\u2019 emotions towards terms.\nFour evaluation metrics were used to compare the induced EPA (EPA-induced) against the manually annotated EPA (EPA-testing): mean absolute error (MAE), Kendall \u03c4 rank correlation, F1-binary (positive and negative), and F1-ternary (positive, neutral, and negative). We used F1binary to evaluate the binary classification performance of the model (positive \u2265 0 and negative < 0 ) and similar to most recently proposed studies in the field (Hamilton et al., 2016), we computed F1-ternary to measure the ternary classification accuracy: positive \u2208 (1, 4.3], neutral \u2208 [\u22121, 1], and negative \u2208 [\u22124.3,\u22121). To calculate the F1-ternary, we used the class-mass normalization (CMN) methods (Zhu et al., 2003) that rescale the predicted label (y\u0302i,l) for a point xi by\nincorporating the class prior as follows :\nargmax l wl y\u0302i,l\nwhere wl is the label mass normalization which is equal to pl/ml where pl is the prior probability of a label l (computed from the labeled data), and ml is the estimated weight of label l over the unlabeled sets.

The results of comparing the induced EPA scores against their true values in the testing set show that the MAE ranged between 0.99 and 1.3 and the ranking correlation 2 \u03c4 was less than 0.2 using cosine similarity and hard clamping ( \u03b1 = 1.0) assumption.

One of the challenges of sentiment analysis is the increasing number of new words and terms in the social media or news resources (e.g., selfie, sexting, photobomb,etc.) that do not have a sentiment score attached to them. Also, there is a need to measure the variance in human attitudes towards some terms over a period of time (e.g., homosexuality, abortion) and to explore other dimensions of humans\u2019 emotions. To overcome these limitations, reduce the cost of manual annotation, and increase the number of the annotated terms, we propose an extension and an evaluation of corpus and thesaurus-based algorithms to automatically induce a three-dimensional sentiment lexicon.\nSimilar to any NLP applications, the vast majority of the work in lexicon induction uses distributional word representations (corpus-based statistics). In this study, the corpus-based label propagation (CLP) algorithm generated the least accurate results. Also, despite the viability of distributional word representations, exactly what syntactic and semantic information it captures is hard to determine, and not clear whether it is relevant for sentiment at all.\nThe semantic lexicon-based label propagation (SLLP) was better than CLP. However, there are also some limitations of using the dictionary based approach 1) the synonym relationship can only be computed between words of the same part of speech, 2) the dictionary has a limited number of\nwords and does not include words that are used in the social media and internet in general.\nOnly one study have experimented with neural word embedding label propagation to expand the one-dimensional sentiment lexicon (Hamilton et al., 2016) with only reporting the result of using SVD word embedding model. In our study, we report the results of using different neural word embedding models. The results show that our neural word embedding model performed better than the SVDword vector approach. These findings require further analysis and assessment on different corpora.\nThe results of combining both the semantic and neural word embedding (NWELP) was better than the corpus-based or semantic lexicon-based algorithms. The semantic neural word embedding provided a higher rank correlation scores and a slighting lower MAE in comparison with the semantic lexicon and neural word embedding-based algorithms. The results of the semantic neural label propagation algorithm are also comparable with those generated using a supervised learning algorithm (SVR) trained on word embeddings and a sentiment lexicon.
