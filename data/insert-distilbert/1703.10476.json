A closer look reveals that this is due to<lb>the deficiencies in the generated word distribution, vocabu-<lb>lary size, and strong bias in the generators towards frequent<lb>captions. Furthermore, humans \u2013 rightfully so \u2013 generate<lb>multiple, diverse captions, due to the inherent ambiguity in<lb>the captioning task which is not considered in today\u2019s sys-<lb>tems. To address these challenges, we change the training ob-<lb>jective of the caption generator from reproducing ground-<lb>truth captions to generating a set of captions that is indis-<lb>tinguishable from human generated captions. Instead of<lb>handcrafting such a learning target, we employ adversar-<lb>ial training in combination with an approximate Gumbel<lb>sampler to implicitly match the generated distribution to the<lb>human one. While our method achieves comparable perfor-<lb>mance to the state-of-the-art in terms of the correctness of<lb>the captions, we generate a set of diverse captions, that are<lb>significantly less biased and match the word statistics better<lb>in several aspects.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
