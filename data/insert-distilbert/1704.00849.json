Introduction", "text": "The primary goal of voice conversion (VC) is to convert the speech from a source speaker to that of a target, without changing the linguistic or phonetic content. However, consider the case of converting one\u2019s voice into that of another who speaks a different language. Traditional VC techniques would have trouble dealing with such cases because most of them require parallel training data in which many pairs of speakers uttered the same texts. In this paper, we are devoted to bridging the gap between parallel and non-parallel VC systems.\nWe pursue a unified generative model for speech that naturally accommodates VC (Sec. 2). In this framework, we do not have to align any frames or to cluster phones or frames explicitly. The idea is skeletonized in the probabilistic graphical model (PGM) in Fig. 1. In this model, our attention is directed away from seeking alignment. Rather, what we are concerned about are 1) finding a good inference model (Sec. 2.1) for the latent variable z and 2) building a good synthesizer whose outputs match the distribution of the real speech of the target (Sec. 2.2 through 2.3). In this paper, we present a specific implementation in which a variational autoencoder (VAE [1]) assumes the inference task and a Wasserstein generative adversarial network (W-GAN [2]) undertakes speech synthesis. Our contribution is two-fold:\n\u2022 We introduce the W-GAN to non-parallel voice conversion and elucidate the reason why it fits this task (Sec. 2).\n\u2022 We demonstrate the ability of W-GAN to synthesize more realistic spectra (Sec. 3)."}, {"heading": "2. Non-parallel voice conversion via deep generative models", "text": "Given spectral frames Xs = {xs,n}Nsn=1 from the source speaker and those Xt = {xt,n\u2032}Ntn\u2032=1 from the target, assume that the real data distributions of the source and the target respectively admit a density p\u2217s and p\u2217t . Let f be a voice conversion function that induces a conditional distribution pt|s. The goal of VC is to estimate f so that pt|s best approximates the real data distribution p\u2217t :\npt|s(f(xs,n)) \u2248 p\u2217t (xt,n\u2032). (1)\nWe can decompose the VC function f into two stages according to the PGM in Fig. 1b. In the first stage, a speakerindependent encoder E\u03c6 infers a latent content zn. In the second stage, a speaker dependent decoder G\u03b8 mixes zn with a speaker-specific variable y to reconstruct the input. The problem of VC is then reformulated as:\nxt,n\u2032 \u2248 f(xs,n) = G\u03b8(E\u03c6(xs,n),y). (2)\nIn short, this model explains the observation x using two latent variables y and z. We will drop the frame indices whenever readability is unharmed. We refer to y as the speaker representation vector because it is determined solely by the speaker identity. We refer to z as the phonetic content vector because with a fixed y, we can generate that speaker\u2019s voice by varying\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n00 84\n9v 3\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 8\nJ un\n2 01\n7\nz. Note that the term phonetic content is only valid in the context of our experimental settings where the speech is natural, noise-free, and non-emotional.\nThis encoder-decoder architecture facilitates VC from unaligned or non-parallel corpora. The function of the encoder is similar to a phone recognizer whereas the decoder operates as a synthesizer. The architecture enables voice conversion for the following reasons. The speaker representation y can be obtained from training. The encoder can infer the phonetic content z. The synthesizer can reconstruct any spectral frame x with the corresponding y and z. Combining these elements, we can build a non-parallel VC system via optimizing the encoder, the decoder (synthesizer), and the speaker representation. With the encoder, frame-wise alignment is no longer needed; frames that belong to the same phoneme class now hinge on a similar z. With this conditional synthesizer, VC becomes as simple as replacing the speaker representation y. (as illustrated in Fig. 1c).\nWe delineate our proposed method incrementally in three subsections: a conditional variational autoencoder (C-VAE) in Sec. 2.1, a generative adversarial nets (GAN) applied to improve the over-simplified C-VAE model in Sec. 2.2, and a Wasserstein GAN (W-GAN) that explicitly considers VC in the training objectives in Sec. 2.3."}, {"heading": "2.1. Modeling speech with a C-VAE", "text": "Recent works have proven the viability of speech modeling with VAEs [3, 4]. A C-VAE that realizes the PGM in Fig. 1a maximizes a variational lower bound of the log-likelihood:\nlog p\u03b8(x|y) \u2264 \u2212Jvae(x|y) = \u2212(Jobs(x|y)+Jlat(x)), (3) Jlat(\u03c6;x) = DKL ( q\u03c6(z|x)\u2016p\u03b8(z) ) , (4)\nJobs(\u03c6, \u03b8;x,y) = \u2212Eq\u03c6(z|x) [ log p\u03b8(x|z,y) ] , (5)\nwhere x \u2208 Xs \u222aXt, DKL is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, p\u03b8(z) is our prior distribution model of z, p\u03b8(x|z,y) is our synthesis model, and q\u03c6(z|x) is our inference model. Note that the synthesis is conditioned on an extra input y, thus the name conditional VAE.\nIn order to train the C-VAE, we have to simplify the model in several aspects. First, we choose p\u03b8(x|z,y) to be a normal distribution whose covariance is an identity matrix. Second, we choose p\u03b8(z) to be a standard normal distribution. Third, the expectation over z is approximated by sampling methods. With these simplifications, we can avoid intractability and focus on modeling the statistics of the Gaussian distributions.\nFor the phonetic content z, we have:\nq\u03c6(z|x) = N (z | E\u03c61(x), diag(E\u03c62(x))), (6)\nwhere \u03c61 \u222a \u03c62 = \u03c6 are the parameters of the encoder, and E\u03c61 and E\u03c62 are the inference models of mean and variance. For the reconstructed or converted spectral frames, we have:\np\u03b8(xm,n|zn,ym) = N (xm,n | G\u03b8(zn,ym), I). (7)\nTraining this C-VAE means maximizing (3). For every input (xn,yn), we can sample the latent variable zn using the re-parameterization trick described in [1]. With zn and yn, the model can reconstruct the input, and by replacing yn, it can convert voice. This means that we are building virtually multiple models in one. Conceptually, the speaker switch lies in the speaker representation y because the synthesis is conditioned on y."}, {"heading": "2.2. Improving speech models with GANs", "text": "Despite the effectiveness of C-VAE, the simplification induces inaccuracy in the synthesis model. This defect originates from the fallible assumption that the observed data is normally distributed and uncorrelated across dimensions. This assumption gave us a defective learning objective, leading to muffled converted voices. Therefore, we are motivated to resort to models that side-step this defect.\nWe can improve the C-VAE by incorporating a GAN objective [5] into the decoder. A vanilla GAN [6] consists of two components: a generator (synthesizer) G\u03b8 that produces realistic spectrum and a discriminatorD\u03c8 that judges whether an input is a true spectrum or a generated one. These two components seek an equilibrium in a min-max game with the Jensen-Shannon divergence DJS as the objective, which is defined as follows:\nJgan(\u03b8, \u03c8;x) = 2 DJS ( p\u2217t \u2016pt|s ) + 2 log 2.\n= Ex\u223cp\u2217t [ log p\u2217t\np\u2217t + pt|s\n] + Ex\u223cpt|s [ log\npt|s p\u2217t + pt|s ] = Ex\u223cp\u2217t [ logD\u2217\u03c8(x) ] + Ez\u223cq\u03c6 [ log ( 1\u2212D\u2217\u03c8(G\u03b8(z)) )] ,\n(8)\nwhere D\u2217\u03c8 denotes the optimal discriminator, which is the density ratio in the second equality in (8). We can view this as a density ratio estimation problem without explicit specification of distributions.\nPresumably, GANs produce sharper spectra because they optimize a loss function between two distributions in a more direct fashion. We can combine the objectives of VAE and GAN by assigning VAE\u2019s decoder as GAN\u2019s generator to form a VAEGAN [5]. However, the VAE-GAN does not consider VC explicitly. Therefore, we propose our final model: variational autoencoding Wasserstein GAN (VAW-GAN)."}, {"heading": "2.3. Direct consideration of voice conversion with W-GAN", "text": "A deficiency in the VAE-GAN formulations is that it treats VC indirectly. We simply assume that when the model is welltrained, it naturally equips itself with the ability to convert voices. In contrast, we can directly optimize a non-parallel VC loss by renovating DJS with a Wasserstein objective [2].\n2.3.1. Wasserstein distance\nThe Wasserstein-1 distance is defined as follows:\nW (p\u2217t , pt|s) = inf \u03b3\u2208\u03a0(p\u2217t ,pt|s)\nE(x,x\u0302)\u223c\u03b3 [ \u2016x\u2212 x\u0302\u2016 ] (9)\nwhere \u03a0(p, q) denotes the set of all joint distributions \u03b3(x, x\u0302) whose marginals are respectively p\u2217t and pt|s. According to the definition, the Wasserstein distance is calculated from the optimal transport, or the best frame alignment. Note that (9) is thus suitable for parallel VC.\nOn the other hand, the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality [7] of (9) allows us to explicitly approach non-parallel VC:\nW (p\u2217t , pt|s) = sup \u2016D\u2016L\u22641\nEx\u223cp\u2217t [ D(x) ] \u2212 Ex\u223cpt|s [ D(x) ] ,\n(10) where the supremum is over all 1-Lipschitz functionsD : X \u2192 R.

W-GAN as a variance modeling alternative", "text": "The Wasserstein objective in (13) is minimized when the distribution of the converted spectrum pt|s is closest to the true data distribution p\u2217t . Unlike VAE that assumes a Gaussian distribution on the observation, W-GAN models the observation implicitly through a series of stochastic procedures, without prescribing any density forms. In Fig. 4, we can observe that the output spectra of the VAW-GAN system have larger variance compared to those of the VAE system. The global variance (GV) of the VAW-GAN output may not be as good as that of the data but the higher values indicate that VAW-GAN does not centralize predicted values at the mean too severely. Since speech has a highly diverse distribution, it requires more sophisticated analysis on this phenomenon."}, {"heading": "4.3. Imperfect speaker modeling in VAW-GAN", "text": "The reason that the speaker similarity of the converted voice is not improved reminds us of the fact that both VAE and VAWGAN optimize the same PGM, thus the same speaker model. Therefore, modeling speaker with one global variable might be insufficient. As modeling speaker with a frame-wise variable may conflict with the phonetic vector z, we may have to resort to other PGMs. We will investigate this problem in the future."}, {"heading": "5. Related work", "text": "To handle non-parallel VC, many researchers resort to framebased, segment-based, or cluster-based alignment schemes. One of the most intuitive ways is to apply an automatic speech recognition (ASR) module to the utterances, and proceed with explicit alignment or model adaptation [15, 16]. The ASR module provides every frame with a phonetic label (usually the phonemic states). It is particularly suitable for text-to-speech (TTS) systems because they can readily utilize these labeled frames [17]. A shortcoming with these approaches is that they require an extra mapping to realize cross-lingual VC. To this end, the INCA-based algorithms [18, 19] were proposed to iteratively seek frame-wise correspondence using converted surrogate frames. Another attempt is to separately build frame clusters for the source and the target, and then set up a mapping between them [20].\nRecent advances include [21], in which the authors exploited i-vectors to represent speakers. Their work differed from ours in that they adopted explicit alignment during training. In [22], the authors represented the phonetic space with senone probabilities outputted from an ASR module, and then generated voice by means of a TTS module. Despite differences in realization, our models do share some similarity ideally."}, {"heading": "6.

non-parallel speech corpora is challenging but highly valuable in real application scenarios. In most situations, the source and the target speakers do not repeat the same texts or they may even speak different languages. In this case, one possible, although indirect, solution is to build a generative model for speech. Generative models focus on explaining the observations with latent variables instead of learning a pairwise transformation function, thereby bypassing the requirement of speech frame alignment. In this paper, we propose a non-parallel VC framework with a variational autoencoding Wasserstein generative adversarial network (VAW-GAN) that explicitly considers a VC objective when building the speech model. Experimental results corroborate the capability of our framework for building a VC system from unaligned data, and demonstrate improved conversion quality.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
