INTRODUCTION", "text": "Shenoy and Shafer [16] presented an axiomatic system and a method for calculation of conditional beliefs by local computations. The method enables to reduce space requirements for representation of multivariate joint belief distributions. Shenoy and Shafer have shown that their framework is suitable both for bayesian and Dempster-Shafer belief distributions. They generalize in their paper similar works of other authors who concentrated on uncertainty propagation in bayesian networks [2], [14], [12], and for DS belief functions [15], [7].\nOne important innovation of Shenoy and Shafer [16] was to separate the notion of factorization from the notion of conditionality. Other authors insisted previously [14], [12] that factors in bayesian networks be conditional distributions.\nThe goal of this paper is to investigate to what extent this innovation is really significant and what impact it may have on development of algorithms for recovery (identification) of belief networks (factorization of belief distribution) from data."}, {"heading": "2. SHENOY/SHAFER FRAMEWORK", "text": "We recall below some definitions from [16]: Hypergraphs: A nonempty set H of nonempty subsets of a finite set S be called a hypergraph on S. The elements of H be called hyperedges. Elements of S be called vertices. H and H\u2019 be both hypergraphs on S, then we call a hypergraph H\u2019 a reduced\nhypergraph of the hypergraph H, iff for every h\u2032 \u2208 H \u2032 also h\u2032 \u2208 H holds, and for every h \u2208 H there exists such a h\u2032 \u2208 H \u2032 that h \u2286 h\u2032.A hypergraph H covers a hypergraph H\u2019 iff for every h\u2032 \u2208 H \u2032 there exists such a h \u2208 H that h\u2032 \u2286 h.\nHypertrees: t and b be distinct hyperedges in a hypergraph H, t \u2229 b 6= \u2205, and b contains every vertex of t that is contained in a hyperedge of H other than t; if X \u2208 t and X \u2208 h, where h \u2208 H and h 6= t, then X \u2208 b. Then we call t a twig of H, and we call b a branch for t. A twig may have more than one branch. We call a hypergraph a hypertree if there is an ordering of its hyperedges, say h1, h2, ..., hn such that hk is a twig in the hypergraph {h1,h 2, ..., hk} whenever 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n. We call any such ordering of hyperedges a hypertree construction sequence for the hypertree. The first hyperedge in the hypertree construction sequence be called the root of the hypertree construction sequence.\nFactorization: Suppose A is a valuation on a finite set of variablesV, and suppose HV is a hypergraph on V. If A is equal to the combination of valuations of all hyperedges h of HV then we say that A factorizes on HV.\nConditioning: Suppose BEL is a belief distribution, and BELE is an indicator potential capturing the evidence E. Then conditional belief function conditioned on E, BEL(.|E), is defined as BEL(.|E) = BEL \u2299 BELE (see [16] p.191 for probabilistic case, BelE may be a simple support function in DS case),The axiom A3 states that to compute (G\u2299H)\u2193g it is not necessary to compute G\u2299H first.\nShenoy and Shafer consider it unimportant whether or not the factorization should refer to conditional probabilities in case of probabilistic belief networks. But for expert system inference engine it is of primary importance how contents of knowledge base should be understood by a user as it should at least justify its conclusions by elements of knowledge base. So if a belief network (or a hypergraph) is to be used as knowledge base, as much elements as possible have to refer to experience of the user.\nIn our opinion, the major reason for this remark of Shenoy and Shafer is that in fact the Dempster-Shafer belief function cannot be decomposed in terms of any conditional belief function as defined in the literature [9]. But an intriguing question remains whether replacement of conditional belief function with a any belief function in the factorization extends essentially the class of such factorizations."}, {"heading": "3. HYPERGRAPHS AND BELIEF NETWORKS", "text": "The axiomatization system of Shenoy/Shafer refers to the notion of factorization along a hypergraph. On the other hand other authors insisted on a decomposition into a belief network. We investigate below implications of this disagreement\nDefinition 1 We define a mapping \u2299 : V V \u00d7V V \u2192 V V called decombination such that: if BEL12 = BEL1\u2299BEL2 then BEL1 = BEL2 \u2299 BEL12.\nIn case of probabilities, decombination means memberwise division: Pr12(A) = Pr1(A)/Pr2(A). In case of DS pseudo-belief functions it means the operator \u2296 yielding a DS pseudo-belief function such that: whenever Bel12 = Bel1 \u2296Bel2 then Q12(A) = c\u00b7Q1/Q2. Both for probabilities and for DS belief functions decombination\nmay be not uniquely determined. Moreover, for DS belief functions not always a decombined DS belief function will exist. Hence we extend the domain to DS pseudo-belief functions which is closed under this operator. We claim here without a proof (which is simple) that DS pseudo-belief functions fit the axiomatic framework of Shenoy/Shafer. Moreover, we claim that if an (ordinary) DS belief function is represented by a factorization in DS pseudo-belief functions, then any propagation of uncertainty yields the very same results as when it would have been factorized into ordinary DS belief functions.\nDefinition 2 By mk-conditioning | of a belief function BEL on a set of variables h we understand the transformation: BEL|h = BEL\u2299BEL\u2193h.\nNotably, mk-conditioning means in case of probability functions proper conditioning. In case of DS pseudo-belief functions the operator | has meaning entirely different from traditionally used notion of conditionality (compare [9]) - mk-conditioning is a technical term used exclusively for valuation of nodes in belief networks. Notice: some other authors e.g. [3] recognized also the necessity of introduction of two different notions in the context of the Shenoy/Shafer axiomatic framework (compare a priori and a posteriori conditionals in [3]). [3] introduces 3 additional axioms governing the \u2019a priori\u2019 conditionality to enable propagation with them. Our mkconditionality is bound only to the assumption of executability of the \u2299 operation and does not assume any further properties of it. We will discuss the consequences of this difference elsewhere. Let us define now the general notion of belief networks (generalizing definition of belief network from [6] - bayesian networks, and [10] - DS networks). :\nDefinition 3 A belief network is a pair (D,BEL) where D is a dag (directed acyclic graph) and BEL is a belief distribution called the underlying distribution. Each node i in D corresponds to a variable Xi in BEL, a set of nodes I corresponds to a set of variables XI and xi, xI denote values drawn from the domain of Xi and from the (cross product) domain of XI respectively. Each node in the network is regarded as\na storage cell for any distribution BEL\u2193{Xi}\u222aX\u03c0(i)|X\u03c0(i) where X\u03c0(i) is a set of nodes corresponding to the parent nodes \u03c0(i) of i. The underlying distribution represented by a belief network is computed via:\nBEL = n\u2299\ni=1\nBEL\u2193{Xi}\u222aX\u03c0(i)|X\u03c0(i)\nPlease notice the local character of valuation of a node: to valuate the node i corresponding to variable Xi only the marginal BEL\n\u2193{Xi}\u222aX\u03c0(i) needs to be known (e.g. from data) and not the entire belief distribution.\nThere exists a straight forward transformation of a belief network structure into a hypergraph, and hence of a belief network into a hypergraph: for every node i of the underlying dag define a hyperedge as the set {Xi}\u222aX\u03c0(i); then the valuation of this hyperedge define as BEL\u2193{Xi}\u222aX\u03c0(i)|X\u03c0(i). We say that the hypergraph obtained in this way is induced by the belief network.\nLet us consider now the inverse operation: transformation of a valuated hypergraph into a belief network. As the first stage we consider structures of a hypergraph and of a belief network (the underlying dag). we say that a belief network is compatible with a hypergraph iff the reduced set of hyperedges induced by the belief network is identical with the reduced hypergraph.\nExample 1 Let us consider the following hypergraph (see Fig.2.a)): {{A,B,C}, {C,D}, {D,E}, {A, E}}. the following belief network structures are compatible with this hypergraph: {A,C \u2192 B, C \u2192 D, D \u2192 E, E \u2192 A} (see Fig.3.a)), {A,C \u2192 B, D \u2192 C, D \u2192 E, E \u2192 A}, (see Fig.3.b)), {A,C \u2192 B, D \u2192 C, E \u2192 D, E \u2192 A}, (see Fig.3.c)), {A,C \u2192 B, D \u2192 C, E \u2192 D, A \u2192 E}. (see Fig.3.d)), \u2738\nExample 2 Let us consider the following hypergraph (see Fig.2.b)): {{A,B,C}, {C,D}, {D,E}, {A, E}, {B,F}, {F,D}}. No belief network structure is compatible with it. \u2738\nThe missing compatibility is connected with the fact that a hypergraph may represent a cyclic graph. Even if a compatible belief network has been found we may have troubles with valuations. In Example 1 an unfriendly valuation of hyperedge {A,C,B} may require an edge AC in a belief network representing the same distribution, but it will make the hypergraph incompatible (as e.g. hyperedge {A,C,E} would be induced). This may be demonstrated as follows:\nDefinition 4 If XJ , XK , XL are three disjoint sets of variables of a distribution BEL, then XJ , XK are said to be conditionally independent given XL (denoted I(XJ , XK |XL)BEL iff\nBEL\u2193XJ\u222aXK\u222aXL|XL \u2299 BEL\u2193XL = BEL\u2193XJ\u222aXL|XL \u2299BEL\u2193XK\u222aXL|XL \u2299 BEL\u2193XL\nI(XJ , XK |XL)BEL is called a conditional independence statement\nLet I(J,K|L)D denote d-separation in a graph [6].:\nTHEOREM 1 Let BELD = {BEL|(D,BEL) be a belief network}. Then: I(J,K|L)D iff I(XJ , XK |XL)BEL for all BEL \u2208 BELD.\nProof of this theorem may be constructed analogously to the one for DS belief networks in [10]. Now we see in the above example that nodes D and E d-separate nodes A and C. Hence within any belief network based on one of the three dags mentioned A will be conditionally independent from C given D and E. But one can easily check that with general type of hypergraph valuation nodes A and C may be rendered dependent. The sad result of this section is, that really\nTHEOREM 2 Hypergraphs considered by Shenoy/Shafer [16] may for a given joint belief distribution have simpler structure than (be properly covered by) the closest hypergraph induced by a belief network."}, {"heading": "4. HYPERTREES AND BELIEF NETWORKS", "text": "Notably, though the axiomatic system of Shenoy/Shafer refers to hypergraph factorization of a joint belief distribution, the actual propagation is run on a hypertree (or more precisely, on one construction sequence of a hypertree, that is on Markov tree) covering that hypergraph. Covering a hypergraph with a hypertree is a trivial task, yet finding the optimal one (with as small number of variables in each hyperedge of the hypertree as possible) may be very difficult [16].\nLet us look closer at the outcome of the process of covering with a reduced hypertree factorization, or more precisely, at the relationship of a hypertree construction sequence and a belief network constructed out of it in the following way:If hk is a twig in the sequence {h1, ..., hk} and hik its branch with ik < k, then let us span the following directed edges in a belief network: First make a complete directed acyclic graph out of nodes hk \u2212 hik . Then add edges Yl \u2192 Xj for every Yl \u2208 hk \u2229 hik and every Xj \u2208 hk \u2212 hik . (see Fig.1). Repeat this for every k=2,..,n. nodes contained in h1).\nFor k=1 proceed as if h1 were a twig with an empty set as a branch for it. It is easily checked that the hypergraph induced by a belief network structure obtained in this way is in fact a hypertree (if reduced, then exactly the original reduced hypertree). Let us turn now to valuations. Let BELi be the valuation originally attached to the hyperedge hi. then BEL = BEL1\u2299...\u2299BELn. (see Fig.4 a)). What conditional belief is to be attached to hn ? First marginalize: BEL \u2032 n = BEL\u2193h1\u2229hn1 \u2299. . .\u2299BEL \u2193hn\u22121\u2229hn n\u22121 \u2299BELn. (see Fig.4 b), c)) Now calculate: BEL\u201dn = BEL\u2032|hn\u2229hinn , and BEL\u201d \u2032 n = BEL \u2032\u2193hn\u2229hin n . Let BEL\u2217k = BELk\u2299BEL \u2193h1\u2229hn k for k=1,...,in-1,in+1,...,(n-1), (see Fig.4 d)) and let BEL\u2217in = (BELin\u2299BEL \u2193h1\u2229hn in )\u2299 BEL\u201d\u2032n . Obviously, BEL = BEL\u22171 \u2299 . . . \u2299 BEL\u2217(n\u22121) \u2299 BEL\u201dn (see Fig.4 e)). Now let us consider a new hypertree only with hyperedges h1, . . . hn\u22121, and with valuations equal to those marked with asterisk (*), and repeat the process until only one hyperedge is left, the now valuation of which is considered as BEL\u201d1. In the process, a new factorization is obtained: BEL = BEL\u201d1 \u2299 . . .\u2299 BEL\u201dn. If now for a hyperedge hk card(hk \u2212 hik) = 1, then we assign BEL\u201dk to the node of the belief network corresponding to hk\u2212hik .

Hence seeking for belief network decompositions of joint belief distributions is sufficient for finding any suitable factorization."}, {"heading": "5. BELIEF TREES AND HYPERTREES", "text": "Let us consider now a special class of hypertrees: connected hypertrees with cardinality of each hyperedge equal 2. It is easy to demonstrate that such hypertrees correspond exactly to directed trees. Furthermore, valuated hypergraphs of this form correspond to belief networks with directed trees as underlying dag structures. Hence we can conclude that any factorization in form of connected hypertrees with cardinality of each hyperedge equal 2 may be recovered from data by algorithms recovering belief trees from data.This does not hold e.g. for poly-trees.\nAlgorithms recovering general type belief networks from data are still to be invented. Major obstacle for such algorithms is the badly defined relationship between various types of representation of uncertainty and the empirical data. This topic will not be discussed here. Instead we will assume that there exists a measure \u03b4(BEL1, BEL2) equal to zero whenever both belief distributions BEL1, BEL2 are identical and being positive otherwise. Furthermore, we assume that \u03b4 grows with stronger deviation of both distributions without specifying it further. The algorithm of Chow/Liu [4] for recovery of tree structure of a probability distribution is well known and has been deeply investigated, so we will omit its description. It requires a distance measure DEP(X,Y) between each two variables X,Y rooted in empirical data and spans a maximum weight spanning unoriented tree between the nodes. Then any orientation of the tree is the underlying dag structure where valuations are calculated as conditional probabilities. To accommodate it for general belief trees one needs a proper measure of distance between variables. As claimed earlier in [1], this distance measure has to fulfill the following requirement: min(DEP (X, Y ), DEP (Y, Z)) > DEP (X,Z) for any X, Y, Z such that there exists a directed path between X and Y, and between Y and Z. For probabilistic belief networks one of such functions is known to be Kullback-Leibler distance:\nDEP0(X, Y ) = \u2211\nx,y\nP (x, y) \u00b7 log P (x, y)\nP (x) \u2217 P (y)\nIf we have the measure \u03b4 available, we can construct the measure DEP as follows: By the ternary joint distribution of the variables X1, X3 with background X3 we understand the function:\nBEL\u2193X1\u00d7X2[X3] = (BEL\u2193X1\u00d7X3|X3 \u2299 BEL\u2193X2\u00d7X3|X3 \u2299 BEL\u2193X3)\u2193X1\u00d7X2\nThen we introduce:\nDEPBN(X1, X2) = min(\u03b4(BEL \u2193X1 \u2299 BEL\u2193X2 , BEL\u2193X1\u00d7X2),\n, min X3;X3\u2208V\u2212X1,X2\n\u03b4(BEL\u2193X1\u00d7X2[X3], BEL\u2193X1\u00d7X2))\nwith V being the set of all variables.The following theorem is easy to prove:\nTHEOREM 4 min(DEPBN(X, Y ), DEPBN(Y, Z)) > DEPBN(X,Z) for any X, Y, Z such that there exists a directed path between X and Y, and between Y and Z.\nThis suffices to extend the Chow/Liu algorithm to recover general belief tree networks from data.To demonstrate the validity of this general theorem, its specialization was implemented for the Dempster-Shafer belief networks. The following \u03b4 function was used: Let Bel1 be a DS belief function and Bel2 be a DS pseudo-belief function approximating it. Let\n\u03b4(Bel2, Bel1) = \u2211\nA;m1(A)>0\nm1(A) \u00b7 | ln Q1(A)\nQ2(A) |\nwhere the assumption is made that natural logarithm of a non-positive number is plus infinity. |.| is the absolute value operator. The values of \u03b4 in variable Bel2 with parameter Bel1 range:[0,+\u221e).For randomly generated tree-like DS belief distributions, if we were working directly with these distributions, as expected, the algorithm yielded perfect decomposition into the original tree. For random samples generated from such distributions, the structure was recovered properly for reasonable sample sizes (200 for up to 8 variables). Recovery of the joint distribution was not too perfect, as the space of possible value combination is tremendous and probably quite large sample sizes would be necessary. It is worth mentioning, that even with some departures from truly tree structure a distribution could be obtained which reasonable approximated the original one."}, {"heading": "6.
