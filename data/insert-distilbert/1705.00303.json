In many topics such as equivalence [5,6,7], sum-\nmarization [8], and dynamics in argumentation [9,10], the notion of extensions plays a central role. Since in classical argumentation semantics, an extension is a set of argu-\nments that are collectively accepted, the existing theories and approaches based on this\nnotion are mainly focused on exploiting the status of individual arguments. However, besides the status of individual arguments, in many situations, we need to know the rea-\nsons for accepting arguments in terms of defense relation. The following are two simple\nexamples.\nF1 : a // c1 // c2 // b yyrrr r F2 : a // boo\nc4 ff\u25b2\u25b2\u25b2\u25b2 c3oo\nFirst, consider arguments a, b in F1 and F2. In F1, accepting a is a reason to accept c2, accepting c2 is a reason to accept c3, and accepting c3 is a reason to accept a. If we allow this relation to be transitive, we find that accepting a is a reason to accept a. Similarly, accepting b is a reason to accept b. Meanwhile, in F2, we have: accepting a is a reason to accept a, and accepting b is a reason to accept b. So, from the perspective of the reasons for accepting a and b, F2 is equivalent to F1, or F2 is a summarization of F1 from another point of view.\nSecond, consider the question when two argument graphs are equivalent in a dynamic setting. For F3 and F4 below, both of them have a complete extension {a, c}. However, the reasons of accepting c in F3 and F4 are different. For the former, c is defended by a, while for the latter, c is unattacked and has no defender. In this sense, F3 and F4 are not equivalent. For example, in order to change the status of argument c from \u201caccepted\u201d to \u201crejected\u201d, in F3, one may produce a new argument to attack the defender a, or to directly attack c. However, in F4 using an argument to attack a cannot change the status of c, since a is not a defender of c.\nF3 : a // b // c F4 : a // b c\nFrom the above two examples, one question arises: under what conditions, can two argument graphs be viewed as equivalent? The existing notions of argumentation equiv-\nalence, including standard equivalence and strong equivalence, are not sufficient to cap-\nture the equivalence of the argument graphs in the situations mentioned above. More specifically,F1 andF2 are not equivalent in terms of the notion of standard equivalence or that of strong equivalence, but they are equivalent in the sense that the reasons for accepting arguments a and b in these two graphs are the same. F3 and F4 are equivalent in terms of standard equivalence, but they are not equivalent in the sense that the reasons for accepting c in these two graphs are different. Although the notion of strong equivalence can be used to identify the difference between F3 and F4, conceptually it is not defined from the perspective of reasons for accepting arguments.\nNote that the reasons for accepting arguments in the above two examples are depicted in terms of defense relation, which plays a central role in Dung\u2019s concept of\nadmissibility and thus in admissibility based semantics. So, it is natural to define a new\nsemantics in this paper based on defense relation such that the reasons for accepting arguments can be encoded. The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we\nintroduce some basic notions of argumentation semantics. In Section 3, we propose the notions of defenses and defense graphs, which lay a foundation of this paper. In Sec-\ntion 4, we formulate defense semantics by applying classical argumentation semantics\nto defense graphs, and study some properties of this new semantics. In Section 5, we introduce two kinds of reasons for accepting arguments in terms of defense semantics.\nWe conclude in Section 6."}, {"heading": "2 Argumentation semantics", "text": "An argument graph or argumentation framework (AF) is defined asF = (A,\u2192), where A is a finite set of arguments and\u2192\u2286 A\u00d7A is a set of attacks between arguments.\nLet F = (A,\u2192) be an argument graph. Given a set B \u2286 A and an argument \u03b1 \u2208 A, B attacks \u03b1, denoted B \u2192 \u03b1, iff there exists \u03b2 \u2208 B such that \u03b2 \u2192 \u03b1. Given an argument \u03b1 \u2208 A, let \u03b1\u2190 = {\u03b2 \u2208 A | \u03b2 \u2192 \u03b1} be the set of arguments attacking \u03b1, and \u03b1\u2192 = {\u03b2 \u2208 A | \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2} be the set of arguments attacked by \u03b1. When \u03b1\u2190 = \u2205, we say that \u03b1 is unattacked, or \u03b1 is an initial argument.\nGiven F = (A,\u2192) and E \u2286 A, we say: E is conflict-free iff \u2204\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 E such that \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2; \u03b1 \u2208 A is defended by E iff \u2200\u03b2 \u2192 \u03b1, it holds that E \u2192 \u03b2; B is admissible iff E is conflict-free, and each argument in E is defended by E; E is a complete extension\niff E is admissible, and each argument in A that is defended by E is in E; E is a grounded extension iff E is the minimal (w.r.t. set-inclusion) complete extension; E is a preferred extension iff E is a maximal (w.r.t. set-inclusion) complete extension; E is a stable extension iff E is conflict-free and E attacks each argument that is not in E. We use \u03c3(F) to denote the set of argument extensions of F under semantics \u03c3, where \u03c3 is a function mapping each argument graph to a set of argument extensions. We use co, gr, pr and st to denote complete, grounded, preferred and stable semantics respectively. There are some other argumentation semantics (cf. [2] for an overview).\nFor argument graphs F1 = (A1,\u21921) and F2 = (A2,\u21922), we use F1 \u222a F2 to denote (A1 \u222a A2,\u21921 \u222a \u21922). The standard equivalence and strong equivalence of argument graphs are defined as follows. For simplicity, in this paper, when we talk\nabout equivalence of AFs, we mainly consider the cases under complete semantics, while the full-fledged study of equivalence will be presented in an extended version of\nthe present paper.\nDefinition 1 (Standard and strong equivalence of AFs). [5] Let F and G be two argument graphs, and \u03c3 be a semantics.\n\u2013 F and G are of standard equivalence w.r.t. a semantics \u03c3, in symbols F \u2261\u03c3 G, iff \u03c3(F) = \u03c3(G). \u2013 F and G are of strong equivalence w.r.t. a semantics \u03c3, in symbols F \u2261\u03c3 s G, iff for\nevery argument graphH, it holds that \u03c3(F \u222aH) = \u03c3(G \u222a H).\nExample 1. Consider F1 \u2212 F4 in Section 1. In terms of Definition 1, under complete semantics, since co(F1) 6= co(F2), F1 6\u2261co F2, which implies that F1 6\u2261cos F2. And, since co(F3) = co(F4), F3 \u2261co F4. Let H = ({d}, {d \u2192 a}). Since co(F3 \u222a H) 6= co(F4 \u222aH), F3 6\u2261cos F4.\nGiven an argument graph F = (A,\u2192), the kernel of F under complete semantics, call c-kernel, is defined as follows.\nDefinition 2 (c-kernel of an AF).

So, for all \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 E, if there exists \u03b3 \u2208 A \\ E such that \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b2, we say that accepting \u03b1 is a (partial) reason to accept \u03b2, denoted as \u3008\u03b1, \u03b2\u3009. And, for all \u03b2 \u2208 E if \u03b2\u2190 = \u2205 (i.e., \u03b2 is an initial argument), we say that \u03b2 is accepted without a reason, denoted as \u3008\u00f8, \u03b2\u3009 where \u00f8 is a symbol denoting an empty position. In this paper, \u3008\u03b1, \u03b2\u3009 or \u3008\u00f8, \u03b2\u3009 is called a defense.\nIf without referring to any specific extension, a defense \u3008\u03b1, \u03b2\u3009 can be viewed as a relation between \u03b1 and \u03b2 satisfying some constraints. Intuitively, there are the following two minimal constraints. First, {\u03b1, \u03b2} is conflict-free. Otherwise, they can not be both accepted. Second, there exists \u03b3 \u2208 A\\{\u03b1, \u03b2} such that \u03b1\u2192 \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b2, in the sense that \u03b1 defends \u03b2 by attacking \u03b2\u2019s attacker \u03b3. Meanwhile, regarding the defense \u3008\u00f8, \u03b2\u3009, the only constraint is that \u03b2 is initial.\nExample 2.

Let F = (A,\u2192) be an argument graph. For \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 A,\n\u2013 \u3008\u03b1, \u03b2\u3009 is a defense iff {\u03b1, \u03b2} is conflict-free, and \u2203\u03b3 \u2208 A\\ {\u03b1, \u03b2} such that \u03b1\u2192 \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b2. \u2013 \u3008\u00f8, \u03b2\u3009 is a defense iff \u03b2 is initial.\nThe set of defenses of F is denoted as FDEF . Given a defense \u3008\u03b1, \u03b2\u3009 or \u3008\u00f8, \u03b2\u3009 \u2208 FDEF , we call \u03b1 the defender, and \u03b2 the defendee, of the defense. Given a setD \u2286 FDEF , we write defendee(D) = {\u03b2 | \u3008\u03b1, \u03b2\u3009, \u3008\u00f8, \u03b2\u3009 \u2208 D} to denote the set of defendees in D, defender(D) = {\u03b1 | \u3008\u03b1, \u03b2\u3009 \u2208 D} to denote the set of defenders in D, and def(D) = defendee(D) \u222a defender(D) be the set of defendees and defenders inD.\nNote that not all arguments of an AF are included in the defenses. Consider the\nfollowing example.\nExample 3. In F6, F7 and F8, \u3008a2, a4\u3009, \u3008a3, a5\u3009, \u3008a4, a6\u3009, \u3008\u00f8, a7\u3009, \u3008a7, a9\u3009, \u3008\u00f8, a11\u3009 and \u3008a11, a13\u3009 are defenses, while some defense-like pairs, for instance (a1, a3) and (a14, a13), are not defenses since both {a1, a3} and {a14, a13} are not conflict-free. And, (\u00f8, a10), (\u00f8, a14) and (\u00f8, a15) are not defenses, because they are not initial arguments, but either self-attacked or attacked by a self-attacked argument.\nF6 : a1 // a2 // a3 // }} a4 // a5 // a6 F8 : a11 // a12 // a13 F7 : a7 // a8 // a9 a10oo zz a14 %% // a15 99tttt\nGiven a defense \u3008x, \u03b1\u3009 where x \u2208 A \u222a {\u00f8} and \u03b1 \u2208 A, \u3008x, \u03b1\u3009 can be regarded as a meta-argument. Its status is affected by other defenses and/or other defense-like pairs (cf. (a1, a3) and (\u00f8, a10) in Example 3). Since the pairs like (a1, a3) and (\u00f8, a10) are not accepted as a defense, but may be used to hamper the acceptance of some defenses, their behavior is similar to that of defeaters in defeasible logic. We call them defeaters\nof defenses (DoD).\nDefinition 4 (Defeaters of defenses). Let F = (A,\u2192) be an argument graph. For \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 A,\n\u2013 (\u03b1, \u03b2) is a DoD, iff {\u03b1, \u03b2} is not conflict-free, and \u2203\u03b3 \u2208 A \\ {\u03b1, \u03b2} such that \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b2.\n\u2013 (\u00f8, \u03b2) is a DoD, iff \u03b2 is self-attacked or attacked by a self-attacked argument.\nThe set of DoDs of F is denoted as FDoD .\nLet arg(FDoD) = {\u03b1, \u03b2 | (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2208 FDoD} \u222a {\u03b2 | (\u00f8, \u03b2) \u2208 FDoD} be the set of arguments involved in FDoD. Let def(FDEF)\u2192 be the set of arguments attacked by def(FDEF). We have the following proposition.\nProposition 1. LetF = (A,\u2192) be an argument graph. It holds thatA = arg(FDoD)\u222a def(FDEF) \u222a def(FDEF)\u2192.\nThis proposition states that arguments in F are equivalent to the union of the arguments in defenses, arguments in defeaters of defenses, and the arguments attacked by the arguments in defenses.\nLetFd = FDEF\u222aFDoD be the set of defenses and their defeaters. The attack relation between the elements of Fd can be identified according to the attack relation between the arguments involved. For convenience,we also write [x, \u03b2] to denote a defense \u3008x, \u03b2\u3009 or a defeater of defenses (x, \u03b2) where x \u2208 A \u222a {\u00f8} and \u03b2 \u2208 A. Formally we have the following definition.\nDefinition 5 (Attacks between defenses and their defeaters). For all [x, \u03b1], [y, \u03b2] \u2208 Fd where x, y \u2208 A \u222a {\u00f8} and \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 A, we say that [x, \u03b1] attacks [y, \u03b2], denoted as [x, \u03b1] \u2192d [y, \u03b2] iff x\u2192 y, x\u2192 \u03b2 , \u03b1 \u2192 y, or \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2.\nThe set of attacks between defenses and their defeaters is denoted as\u2192d. Since the status of a defense is determined by that of other defenses and affected by\ndefeaters of defenses through the attacks between them, to evaluate the status of normal\ndefenses, one possible way is to use defense graph, which is defined as follows.\nDefinition 6 (Defense graph). Let F = (A,\u2192) be an argument graph. Let Fd = FDEF \u222a FDoD . A defense graph w.r.t. F , denoted d(F), is defined as follows.\nd(F) = (Fd,\u2192d) (2)\nA defense graph can be viewed as a kind of meta-argumentation [11].\nExample 4. The defense graph of F6 is as follows.\nd(F6) : (a2, a1) //\n%%\u25b2\u25b2 \u25b2\u25b2\n\u25b2\u25b2\n(a3, a2) // oo \u3008a2, a4\u3009 // \u3008a3, a5\u3009oo\n(a1, a3)\nOOee\nWW \u3008a4, a6\u3009\nOO"}, {"heading": "4 Defense semantics", "text": "In a defense graph d(F) = (Fd,\u2192d), nodes are defenses and/or defeaters of defenses, rather than arguments in the corresponding argument graphF . So, when applying classical semantics to d(F), we get a set of extensions, each of which is a set of defenses. By slightly modifying the definition for classical semantics, defense semantics can be\ndefined as follows.\nDefinition 7 (Defense semantics). Defense semantics is a function \u03a3 mapping each defense graph to a set of extensions of defenses. Given a defense graph d(F) = (Fd,\u2192d ) where Fd = FDEF \u222a FDoD , let D \u2286 FDEF .

The former can be included in extensions, while the\nlatter are only used to prevent the acceptance of some defenses.\nNow, let us consider some properties of the defense semantics of an argument graph. The first property is about the relation between defense semantics and classical semantics. Let D \u2208 \u03a3(d(F)) be a \u03a3-extension of d(F). Now the question is whether the set of defenders and defendees in D is a \u03c3-extension of F? In order to verify this property, technically, we first present the follow lemma. The lemma states that for all \u3008\u03b1, \u03b2\u3009 \u2208 D, if \u03b1 is attacked by an argument \u03b3 \u2208 A, then \u2203\u03b7 \u2208 def(D) such that \u03b7 attacks \u03b3.\nLemma 1 For allD \u2208 \u03a3(d(F)), for all \u3008x, y\u3009 \u2208 D, for all \u03b3 \u2208 A, if \u03b3 \u2192 x or \u03b3 \u2192 y, then def(D) \u2192 \u03b3.\nExample 5.

Take D2 and \u3008a, c2\u3009 in D2 as an example. def(D2) = {a, c2, c3}.

For all D \u2208 CO(d(F)), def(D) \u2208 co(F).\nTheorem 1 makes clear that for each complete defense extension D of a defense graph, there exists a complete argument extension E of the corresponding argument graph such thatE is equal to def(D). On the other hand, the following theorem says that for each complete argument extension E of an argument graph, there exists a complete defense extension D of the corresponding defense graph such that D = d(E) where d(E) = {\u3008x, y\u3009 \u2208 FDEF | x \u2208 E \u222a {\u00f8}, y \u2208 E}.\nTheorem 2. For all E \u2208 co(F), d(E) \u2208 CO(d(F)).\nThe relation between argument extensions and defense extensions under other se-\nmantics is presented in the following corollaries.\nCorollary 1.

For all \u03a3 \u2208 {GR,PR, ST} it holds that for all E \u2208 \u03c3(F), d(E) \u2208 \u03a3(d(F)).\nProof. Under grounded semantics, we need to verify that d(E) is minimal (w.r.t. setinclusion). Assume the contrary. Then \u2203D\u2032 ( d(E) such that D\u2032 is a grounded extension. According to theorem1, def(D\u2032) is a complete extension. It follows that def(D\u2032) ( def(d(E)) = E. It turns out that E is not a grounded extension. Contradiction.\nUnder preferred semantic, it is easy to verify that d(E) is maximal (w.r.t. setinclusion).\nUnder stable semantics, we need to prove that for all [x, \u03b1] \u2208 Fd \\ d(E): d(E) \u2192 [x, \u03b1]. Assume the contrary. Then, \u2203[x, \u03b1] \u2208 Fd \\ d(E) such that d(E) does not attack [x, \u03b1]. So, E does not attack x and \u03b1. Since E is stable, it holds that {x, \u03b1} \\ {\u00f8} \u2286 E. So, [x, \u03b1] \u2208 E. Contradiction.\nTheorems 1 and 2 and Corollaries 1 and 2 describe the relation between argument extensions and defense extensions under various semantics. This relation can be further\ndescribed by two equations in the following two corollaries.\nFirst, by overloading the notation, let d(\u03c3(F)) = {d(E) | E \u2208 \u03c3(F)}, where \u03c3 \u2208 {co, gr, pr, st}.\nCorollary 3. For all \u03c3 \u2208 {co, pr, gr, st}, it holds that d(\u03c3(F)) = \u03a3(d(F)).\nProof. For all d(E) \u2208 d(\u03c3(F)), according to Theorem 2 and Corollary 2, d(E) \u2208 \u03a3(d(F)). For all D \u2208 \u03a3(d(F)), according to Theorem 1 and Corollary 1, def(D) \u2208 \u03c3(F). Since d(def(D)) = {\u3008\u03b2, \u03b1\u3009 \u2208 FDEF | \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 def(D)} \u222a {\u3008\u00f8, \u03b1\u3009 \u2208 FDEF | \u03b1 \u2208 def(D)} = D, it holds thatD \u2208 d(\u03c3(F)).\nExample 6. Consider F9 and d(F9) below. Under complete semantics, we have:\n\u2013 co(F9) = {E1, E2}, where E1 = {}, E2 = {b};\n\u2013 d(co(F9)) = {d(E1), d(E2)}, where d(E1) = {}, d(E2) = {\u3008b, b\u3009}; \u2013 CO(d(F9)) = {D1, D2}, whereD1 = {},D2 = {\u3008b, b\u3009}.\nSo, it holds that d(co(F9)) = CO(d(F9)).\nF9 : a // boo\nd(F9) : \u3008a, a\u3009 //\n%%\u274f\u274f \u274f\u274f\n\u274f\u274f \u274f\n\u3008b, b\u3009\n$$\u274f\u274f \u274f\u274f\n\u274f\u274f \u274f\noo\nyyttt tt tt\nc __\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744\u2744 (a, c)\n==\n99\n,, //\nOO\n(c, b) GG\noo //\nee\n(b, a)\nxx\nrr oo\ndd\naa\nSecond, by overloading the notation, let def(\u03a3(d(F))) = {def(D) | D \u2208 \u03a3(d(F))}, where \u03a3 \u2208 {CO,GR,PR, ST}.\nCorollary 4. For all \u03a3 \u2208 {CO,GR,PR, ST}, it holds that \u03c3(F) = def(\u03a3(d(F))).\nProof. For all E \u2208 \u03c3(F), according to Theorem 2 and Corollary 2, d(E) \u2208 \u03a3(d(F)). Since def(d(E)) = E, E \u2208 def(\u03a3(d(F))). For all def(D) \u2208 def(\u03a3(d(F))), since D \u2208 \u03a3(d(F)), according to Theorem 1 and Corollary 1, def(D) \u2208 co(F).\nExample 7. Under compete semantics, continue Example 6, def(CO(d(F9))) = {def(D1), def(D2)}, where def(D1) = {}, def(D2) = {b}. It holds that co(F9) = def(CO(d(F9))).\nThe second property formulated in Theorems 3 and 4 is about the equivalence\nof argument graphs under defense semantics, called defense equivalence of argument graphs.\nDefinition 8 (Defense equivalence of AFs). Let F and G be two argument graphs. F and G are of defense equivalence w.r.t. a semantics \u03a3, denoted as F \u2261\u03a3\nd G, iff\n\u03a3(d(F)) = \u03a3(d(G)).\nConcerning the relation between defense equivalence and standard equivalence of\nargument graphs, we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 3. Let F and G be two argument graphs, and \u03a3 \u2208 {CO,GR,PR, ST} be a semantics. If F \u2261\u03a3\nd G, then F \u2261\u03c3 G.\nProof. If F \u2261\u03a3 d G, then \u03a3(d(F)) = \u03a3(d(G)). According to Corollary 4, it follows that \u03c3(F) = def(\u03a3(d(F))) = def(\u03a3(d(G))) = \u03c3(G). Since \u03c3(F) = \u03c3(G), F \u2261\u03c3 G.\nNote that F \u2261\u03c3 G does not imply F \u2261\u03a3 d G in general. Consider the following example under complete semantics.\nExample 8. Since co(F3) = co(F4) = {{a, c}}, it holds that F3 \u2261co F4. Since CO(d(F3)) = {{\u3008\u00f8, a\u3009}, \u3008a, c\u3009} and CO(d(F4)) = {{\u3008\u00f8, a\u3009}, \u3008\u00f8, c\u3009}, CO(d(F3)) 6= CO(d(F4)). So, it is not the case that F3 \u2261COd F4.\nF3 : a // b // c d(F3) : \u3008\u00f8, a\u3009 \u3008a, c\u3009\nF4 : a // b c d(F4) : \u3008\u00f8, a\u3009 \u3008\u00f8, c\u3009\nAbout the relation between defense equivalence and strong equivalence of argument\ngraphs, under complete semantics, we have the following lemma and theorem.\nLemma 2 It holds that CO(d(F)) = CO(d(Fck)).\nProof. According to Corollary 3, d(co(F)) = CO(d(F)), d(co(Fck)) = CO(d(Fck)). Since co(F) = co(Fck), it holds that CO(d(F)) = d(co(F)) = d(co(Fck)) = CO(d(Fck)).\nTheorem 4. Let F and G be two argument graphs. If F \u2261co s G, then F \u2261CO d G.\nProof. If F \u2261cos G, then F ck = Gck. So, CO(d(Fck)) = CO(d(Gck)). According to Lemma 2, CO(d(F)) = CO(d(Fck)), CO(d(G)) = CO(d(Gck)). So, we have CO(d(F)) = CO(d(G)), i.e., F \u2261CO\nd G.\nNote that F \u2261COd G does not imply F \u2261 co s G in general. Consider the following\nexample.\nExample 9. Since CO(d(F3)) = CO(d(F10)) = {{\u3008\u00f8, a\u3009}, \u3008a, c\u3009}, F3 \u2261COd F10. However, since Fck3 6= F ck 10 , F3 6\u2261 co s F10.\nF10 : a // \u2743 \u2743\u2743 b // c d(F10) : \u3008\u00f8, a\u3009 \u3008a, c\u3009\nd\n@@"}, {"heading": "5 Encoding reasons for accepting arguments", "text": "Defense semantics can be used to encode reasons for accepting arguments. Consider\nthe following example.\nExample 10. CO(d(F11)) = {D1, D2}, whereD1 = {\u3008b, b\u3009, \u3008b, d\u3009, \u3008g, d\u3009, \u3008e, g\u3009, \u3008\u00f8, e\u3009}, D2 = {\u3008a, a\u3009, \u3008g, d\u3009, \u3008e, g\u3009, \u3008\u00f8, e\u3009}. One way to capture reasons for accepting arguments is to relate each reason to an extension of defenses. For instance, concerning the reasons for accepting d w.r.t.D1, we differentiate the following reasons:\n\u2013 Direct reason: accepting {b, g} is a direct reason for accepting d. This reason can be identified in terms of defenses \u3008b, d\u3009 and \u3008g, d\u3009 inD1. \u2013 Root reason: accepting {e, b} is a root reason for accepting d, in the sense that each element of a root reason is either an initial argument, or an argument without\nfurther defenders except itself. This reason can be identified by means of viewing\neach defense as a binary relation, and allowing this relation to be transitive. Given \u3008e, g\u3009 and \u3008g, d\u3009 inD1, we have \u3008e, d\u3009. Since e is an initial argument, it is an element of the root reason. Given \u3008b, d\u3009 in D1, since b\u2019s defender is b itself, b is an element of the root reason.\nF11 : d d(F11) : \u3008a, a\u3009 // \u3008b, b\u3009oo\n\u271e\u271e \u271e\u271e \u271e\u271e \u271e\u271e \u271e\u271e a // boo // c\nOO\n\u3008b, d\u3009\nOO\n//\n\u3008a, c\u3009\nOO\noo\ne // f // g\nOO\n\u3008f, c\u3009 //\nOO\n\u3008g, d\u3009\nOO\noo\n\u3008e, g\u3009\nOO CC \u271e\u271e\u271e\u271e\u271e\u271e\u271e\u271e\u271e\u271e\n\u3008\u00f8, e\u3009\ndd\u274f\u274f\u274f\u274f\u274f\nThe informal notions in Example 10 are formulated as follows.\nDefinition 9 (Direct reasons for accepting arguments). Let F = (A,\u2192) be an argument graph. Direct reasons for accepting arguments in F under a semantics \u03a3 is a function, denoted drF\n\u03a3 , mapping from F to sets of arguments, such that for all \u03b1 \u2208 A,\ndrF \u03a3 (\u03b1) = {DR(\u03b1,D) | D \u2208 \u03a3(d(F))} (3)\nwhere DR(\u03b1,D) = {\u03b2 | \u3008\u03b2, \u03b1\u3009 \u2208 D}, if \u03b1 is not an initial argument; otherwise, DR(\u03b1,D) = {\u00f8}.\nExample 11. Continue Example 10. According to Definition 9, drF11 CO (d) = {R1, R2}, where R1 = {b, g},R2 = {g}. dr F11 CO (f) = {R3, R4}, where R3 = R4 = {}.\nFor all D \u2208 \u03a3(d(F)), we view D as a transitive relation, and let D+ be the transitive closure ofD.\nDefinition 10 (Root reasons for accepting arguments). Let F = (A,\u2192) be an argument graph. Root reasons for accepting arguments in F under a semantics \u03a3 is a function, denoted rrF\n\u03a3 , mapping from F to sets of arguments, such that for all \u03b1 \u2208 A,\nrrF \u03a3 (\u03b1) = {RR(\u03b1,D) | D \u2208 \u03a3(d(F))} (4)\nwhere RR(\u03b1,D) = {\u03b2 \u2208 A | \u3008\u03b2, \u03b2\u3009 \u2208 D+, \u03b2 = \u03b1} \u222a {\u03b2 \u2208 A | (\u3008\u03b2, \u03b1\u3009 \u2208 D+), (\u3008\u03b2, \u03b2\u3009 \u2208 D+\u2228\u03b2\u2190 = \u2205)}, if \u03b1 is not an initial argument; otherwise,RR(\u03b1,D) = {\u00f8}.\nAccording Definition 10, we say that a set of argumentsRR(\u03b1,D) is a root reason of an argument \u03b1 if and only if for all \u03b2 \u2208 RR(\u03b1,D), \u03b2 is either equal to \u03b1 when \u03b1 (partially) defends itself directly or indirectly through a transitive relation of defenses inD, or an initial argument, or an argument that can (partially) defend itself directly or indirectly.\nExample 12. Continue Example 10. D+1 = D1 \u222a {\u3008e, d\u3009, \u3008\u00f8, g\u3009, \u3008\u00f8, d\u3009}; D + 2 = D2 \u222a {\u3008e, d\u3009, \u3008\u00f8, g\u3009, \u3008\u00f8, d\u3009}. According to Definition 10, rrF11 CO (d) = {R1, R2}, where R1 = {b, e}, R2 = {e}. rr F11 CO (f) = {R3, R4}, where R3 = R4 = {}.\nMotivated by the first example in Section 1 (regarding F1), based on the notion of root reasons, we propose as follows a notion of root equivalence of AFs.\nDefinition 11 (Root equivalence of AFs). Let F = (A1,\u21921) and H = (A2,\u21922) be two argument graphs. For all B \u2286 A1 \u2229 A2, if B 6= \u2205, we say that F and H are equivalent w.r.t. the root reasons for acceptingB under semantics\u03a3, denotedF|B \u2261\u03a3rr H|B, iff for all \u03b1 \u2208 B, rrF\n\u03a3 (\u03b1) = rrH \u03a3 (\u03b1).\nWhen B = A1 = A2, we write F \u2261\u03a3rr H for F|B \u2261 \u03a3 rr H|B.\nExample 13. ConsiderF1 andF2 in Section 1 again. Under complete semantics,CO(d(F1)) = {D1, D2, D3}whereD1 = {},D2 = {\u3008a, c2\u3009, \u3008c2, c3\u3009, \u3008c3, a\u3009},D3 = {\u3008b, c4\u3009, \u3008c1, b\u3009, \u3008c4, c1\u3009}. CO(d(F2)) = {D4, D5, D6}whereD4 = {},D5 = {\u3008a, a\u3009},D6 = {\u3008b, b\u3009}. LetB = {a, b}. rrF1\nCO (a) = {{}, {a}, {}}, rrF2co (a) = {{}, {a}, {}}, rr F1 CO (b) = {{}, {}, {b}}, rrF2co (b) = {{}, {}, {b}}. So, it holds that F1|B = CO rr F2|B.\nTheorem 5. Let F = (A1,\u21921) and H = (A2,\u21922) be two argument graphs. If F \u2261COrr H, then F \u2261 co H.\nProof. According to Definition 10, the number of extensions of co(F) is equal to the number of rrFCO(\u03b1), where \u03b1 \u2208 A1. Since rr F CO(\u03b1) = rr H CO(\u03b1), A1 = A2. Let rrFCO(\u03b1) = rr H CO(\u03b1) = {R1, . . . , Rn}. Let co(F) = {E1, . . . , En} be the set of extensions of F , where n \u2265 1. For all \u03b1 \u2208 A1, for all Ri, i = 1, . . . , n, we have \u03b1 \u2208 Ei iff Ri 6= {}, in that in terms of Definition 10,when Ri 6= {}, there is a reason to accept \u03b1. On the other hand, let co(H) = {S1, . . . , Sn} be the set of extensions of H. For all \u03b1 \u2208 A2 = A1, for all Ri, i = 1, . . . , n, for the same reason, we have \u03b1 \u2208 Si iff Ri 6= {}. So, it holds that Ei = Si for i = 1, . . . , n, and hence co(F) = co(H), i.e., F \u2261co H.\nNote that F \u2261co H does not implyF \u2261COrr H in general. This can be easily verified by considering F3 and F4 in Example 8.\nThe notion of root equivalence of argument graphs can be used to capture a kind of\nsummarization in the graphs. Consider the following example borrowed from [8].\nExample 14. Let F12 = (A,\u2192) and F13 = (A\u2032,\u2192\u2032), illustrated below. Under complete semantics, F13 is a summarization of F12 in the sense that A\n\u2032 \u2286 A, and the root reason of each argument in F13 is the same as that of each corresponding argument in F12. More specifically, it holds that rr F12 CO (e3) = rr F13 CO (e3) = {{e1, e2}}, rrF12 CO (e2) = rr F13 CO (e2) = {{\u00f8}}, and rr F12 CO (e1) = rr F13 CO (e1) = {{\u00f8}}.\nF12 : e1 // a1 // a2 // o // e3 F13 : e1 // o // e3\ne2 // b1 // b2 ??\u2466\u2466\u2466 e2 ??\u2467\u2467\u2467\nDefinition 12 (Summarization of AFs). Let F = (A1,\u21921) and H = (A2,\u21922) be two argument graphs. F is a summarization of H under a semantics \u03c3 iff A1 \u2282 A2, and F|A1 \u2261\u03c3rr H|A1.\nNow, a property of summarization of argument graphs under complete semantics is\nas follows.\nTheorem 6. Let F = (A1,\u21921) and H = (A2,\u21922) be two argument graphs. If F is a summarization of H under complete semantics CO, then CO(F) = {E \u2229 A2 | E \u2208 CO(H)}.\nProof. Let co(F) = {E1, . . . , En}, co(H) = {S1, . . . , Sn}. According to the proof of Theorem 5, E1 = S1 \u2229 A2. Therefore, we have co(F) = {E \u2229 A2 | E \u2208 co(H)}.\nThe property looks similar to that of directionality of argumentation [12]. However, they are conceptually different. On the hand hand, it is said that if a semantics \u03c3 satisfies the property of directionality if and only if \u2200F = (A,\u2192), \u2200U \u2286 A, if U is an unattacked set, then \u03c3(F \u2193 U) = {E \u2229 U | E \u2208 \u03c3(F)} where F \u2193 U = (U,\u2192 \u2229(U \u00d7U)). So, the property of directionality is about the relation between an argument graph and its subgraph induced by an unattacked set of arguments. On the other hand,\nthe property of summarization of argument graphs is about the relation between two\nroot equivalent argument graphs."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a defense semantics of argumentation based on a novel\nnotion of defense graphs, and used it to encode reasons for accepting arguments. By introducing two new kinds of equivalence relation between argument graphs, i.e., defense\nequivalence and root equivalence, we have shown that defense semantics can be used\nto capture the equivalence of argument graphs from the perspective of reasons for accepting arguments. In addition, we have defined a notion of summarization of argument\ngraphs by exploiting root equivalence.\nUnder complete semantics, defense equivalence is located inbetween strong and\nstandard equivalence. It is interesting to further investigate its position in the so-called\nequivalence zoo where further equivalence notions inbetween the both extremal versions are compared too [13], and to study how defense equivalence, root equivalence\nand strong equivalence are related. We will present this part of work in an extended\nversion of the present paper.\nSince defense semantics explicitly represents defense relation in extensions and can\nbe used to encoded reasons for accepting arguments, it provides a new way to investigate such topics as summarization in argumentation [8], dynamics of argumentation\n[9,14,10], dialogical argumentation [15,16], etc. Further work on these topics is promis-\ning.
