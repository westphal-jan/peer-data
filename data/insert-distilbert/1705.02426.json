Introduction", "text": "Multi-relational embedding, or knowledge graph embedding, is the task of finding the latent representations of entities and relations for better inference over knowledge graphs. This problem has become increasingly important in recent machine learning due to the broad range of important applications of large-scale knowledge bases, such as Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008), DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007) and Google\u2019s Knowledge Graph (Singhal, 2012), including question-answering (Ferrucci et al., 2010), information retrieval (Dalton et al., 2014) and natural language processing (Gabrilovich & Markovitch, 2009).\nA knowledge base (KB) typically stores factual information as subject-relation-object triplets.

Commutative diagram for the analogy between the Solar System (red) and the Rutherford-Bohr Model (blue) (atom system). By viewing the atom system as a \u201cminiature\u201d of the solar system (via the scale down relation), one is able to complete missing facts (triplets) about the latter by mirroring the facts about the former. The analogy is built upon three basic analogical structures (parallelograms): \u201csun is to planets as nucleus is to electrons\u201d, \u201csun is to mass as nucleus is to charge\u201d and \u201cplanets are to mass as eletrons are to charge\u201d.\nworld knowledge graph is both extremely large and highly incomplete by nature (Min et al., 2013). How can we use the observed triplets in an incomplete graph to induce the unobserved triples in the graph presents a tough challenge for machine learning research.\nVarious statistical relational learning methods (Getoor, 2007; Nickel et al., 2015) have been proposed for this task, among which vector-space embedding models are most particular due to their advantageous performance and scalability (Bordes et al., 2013). The key idea in those approaches is to find dimensionality reduced representations for both the entities and the relations, and hence force the models to generalize during the course of compression. Representative models of this kind include tensor factorization (Singhal, 2012; Nickel et al., 2011), neural tensor networks (Socher et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2013), translationbased models (Bordes et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2015b), bilinear models and its variants (Yang et al., 2014; Trouillon et al., 2016), pathwise methods (Guu et al., 2015), embeddings based on holographic representations (Nickel et al., 2016), and product graphs that utilizes additional site information for the predictions of unseen edges in a semi-supervised manner (Liu & Yang, 2015; 2016). ar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n02 42\n6v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 6\nJ ul\n2 01\n7\nLearning the embeddings of entities and relations can be viewed as a knowledge induction process, as those induced latent representations can be used to make inference about new triplets that have not been seen before.\nDespite the substantial efforts and great successes so far in the research on multi-relational embedding, one important aspect is missing, i.e., to study the solutions of the problem from the analogical inference point of view, by which we mean to rigorously define the desirable analogical properties for multi-relational embedding of entities and relations, and to provide algorithmic solution for optimizing the embeddings w.r.t. the analogical properties. We argue that analogical inference is particularly desirable for knowledge base completion, since for instance if system A (a subset of entities and relations) is analogous to system B (another subset of entities and relations), then the unobserved triples inB could be inferred by mirroring their counterparts inA. Figure 1 uses a toy example to illustrate the intuition, where system A corresponds to the solar system with three concepts (entities), and systemB corresponds the atom system with another three concepts. An analogy exists between the two systems because B is a \u201cminiature\u201d of A. As a result, knowing how the entities are related to each other in system A allows us to make inference about how the entities are related to each other in system B by analogy.\nAlthough analogical reasoning was an active research topic in classic AI (artificial intelligence), early computational models mainly focused on non-differentiable rulebased reasoning (Gentner, 1983; Falkenhainer et al., 1989; Turney, 2008), which can hardly scale to very large KBs such as Freebase or Google\u2019s Knowledge Graph. How to leverage the intuition of analogical reasoning via statistical inference for automated embedding of very large knowledge graphs has not been studied so far, to our knowledge.\nIt is worth mentioning that analogical structures have been observed in the output of several word/entity embedding models (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014). However, those observations stopped there as merely empirical observations. Can we mathematically formulate the desirable analogical structures and leverage them in our objective functions to improve multi-relational embedding? In this case, can we develop new algorithms for tractable inference for the embedding of very large knowledge graphs? These questions present a fundamental challenge which has not been addressed by existing work, and answering these questions are the main contributions we aim in this paper. We name this open challenge as the analogical inference problem, for the distinction from rule-based analogical reasoning in classic AI.\nOur specific novel contributions are the following:\n1. A new framework that, for the first time, explicitly\nmodels analogical structures in multi-relational embedding, and that improves the state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets;\n2. The algorithmic solution for conducting analogical inference in a differentiable manner, whose implementation is as scalable as the fastest known relational embedding algorithms;\n3. The theoretical insights on how our framework provides a unified view of several representative methods as its special (and restricted) cases, and why the generalization of such cases lead to the advantageous performance of our method as empirically observed.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: \u00a72 introduces related background where multi-relational embedding is formulated as linear maps. \u00a73 describes our new optimization framework where the desirable analogical structures are rigorously defined by the the commutative property of linear maps. \u00a74 offers an efficient algorithm for scalable inference by exploiting the special structures of commutative linear maps, \u00a75 shows how our framework subsumes several representative approaches in a principled way, and \u00a76 reports our experimental results, followed by the concluding remarks in \u00a77."}, {"heading": "2.

Both v and W are to be learned from K."}, {"heading": "2.2. Relations as Linear Maps", "text": "We formulate each relation r as a linear map that, for any given (s, r, o) \u2208 K, transforms the subject s from its original position in the vector space to somewhere near the object o. In other words, we expect the latent representations for any valid (s, r, o) to satisfy\nv>s Wr \u2248 v>o (1)\nThe degree of satisfaction in the approximated form of (1) can be quantified using the inner product of v>s Wr and vo. That is, we define a bilinear score function as:\n\u03c6(s, r, o) = \u3008v>s Wr, vo\u3009 = v>s Wrvo (2)\nOur goal is to learn v and W such that \u03c6(s, r, o) gives high scores to valid triples, and low scores to the invalid ones.\nIn contrast to some previous models (Bordes et al., 2013) where relations are modeled as additive translating operators, namely vs + wr \u2248 vo, the multiplicative formulation in (1) offers a natural analogy to the first-order logic where each relation is treated as a predicate operator over input arguments (subject and object in our case). Clearly, the linear transformation defined by a matrix, a.k.a. a linear map, is a richer operator than the additive transformation defined by a vector. Multiplicative models are also found to substantially outperform additive models empirically (Nickel et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2014)."}, {"heading": "2.3. Normal Transformations", "text": "Instead of allowing arbitrary linear maps to be used for representing relations, a particular family of matrices has been studied for \u201cwell-behaved\u201d linear maps. This family is named as the normal matrices. Definition 2.1 (Normal Matrix). A real matrixA is normal if and only if A>A = AA>.\nNormal matrices have nice theoretical properties which are often desirable form relational modeling, e.g., they are unitarily diagonalizable and hence can be conveniently analyzed by the spectral theorem (Dunford et al., 1971). Representative members of the normal family include:\n\u2022 Symmetric Matrices for which WrW>r = W>r Wr = W 2r . These includes all diagonal matrices and positive semi-definite matrices, and the symmetry implies \u03c6(s, r, o) = \u03c6(o, r, s). They are suitable for modeling symmetric relations such as is identical.\n\u2022 Skew-/Anti-symmetric Matrices for which WrW>r = W>r Wr = \u2212W 2r , which implies \u03c6(s, r, o) = \u2212\u03c6(o, r, s). These matrices are suitable for modeling asymmetric relations such as is parent of .\n\u2022 Rotation Matrices for which WrW>r = W>r Wr = Im, which suggests that the relation r is invertible as W\u22121r always exists.

Proposed Analogical Inference Framework", "text": "Analogical reasoning is known to play a central role in human induction about knowledge (Gentner, 1983; Minsky,\n1988; Holyoak et al., 1996; Hofstadter, 2001). Here we provide a mathematical formulation of the analogical structures of interest in multi-relational embedding in a latent semantic space, to support algorithmic inference about the embeddings of entities and relations in a knowledge graph."}, {"heading": "3.1. Analogical Structures", "text": "Consider the famous example in the word embedding literature (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014), for the following entities and relations among them:\n\u201cman is to king as woman is to queen\u201d\nIn an abstract notion we denote the entities by a (as man) , b (as king), c (as woman) and d (as queen), and the relations by r (as crown) and r\u2032 (asmale 7\u2192 female), respectively. These give us the subject-relation-object triplets as follows:\na r\u2192 b, c r\u2192 d, a r\n\u2032 \u2192 c, b r \u2032 \u2192 d (3)\nFor multi-relational embeddings, r and r\u2032 are members of R and are modeled as linear maps in our case.\nThe relational maps in (3) can be visualized using a commutative diagram (Ada\u0301mek et al., 2004; Brown & Porter, 2006) from the Category Theory, as shown in Figure 2, where each node denotes an entity and each edge denotes a linear map that transforms one entity to the other. We also refer to such a diagram as a \u201cparallelogram\u201d to highlight its particular algebraic structure1.\nThe parallelogram in Figure 2 represents a very basic analogical structure which could be informative for the inference about unknown facts (triplets). To get a sense about why analogies would help in the inference about unobserved facts, we notice that for entities a, b, c, d which form an analogical structure in our example, the parallelogram structure is fully determined by symmetry. This means that if we know a r\u2192 b and a r \u2032\n\u2192 c, then we can induce the remaining triplets of c r\u2192 d and b r \u2032\n\u2192 d. In other words, understanding the relation betweenman and king helps us to fill up the unknown relation between woman and queen.\n1Notice that this is different from parallelograms in the geometric sense because each edge here is a linear map instead of the difference between two nodes in the vector space.\nAnalogical structures are not limited to parallelograms, of course, though parallelograms often serve as the building blocks for more complex analogical structures. As an example, in Figure 1 of \u00a71 we show a compound analogical structure in the form of a triangular prism, for mirroring the correspondent entities/relations between the atom system and the solar system. Formally define the desirable analogical structures in a computationally tractable objective for optimization is the key for solving our problem, which we will introduce next."}, {"heading": "3.2. Commutative Constraint for Linear Maps", "text": "Although it is tempting to explore all potentially interesting parallelograms in the modeling of analogical structure, it is computationally intractable to examine the entire powerset of entities as the candidate space of analogical structures. A more reasonable strategy is to identify some desirable properties of the analogical structures we want to model, and use those properties as constraints for reducing the candidate space.\nAn desirable property of the linear maps we want is that all the directed paths with the same starting node and end node form the compositional equivalence. Denoting by \u201c\u25e6\u201d the composition operator between two relations, the parallelogram in Figure 2 contains two equivalent compositions as:\nr \u25e6 r\u2032 = r\u2032 \u25e6 r (4) which means that a is connected to d via either path. We call this the commutativity property of the linear maps, which is a necessary condition for forming commutative parallelograms and therefore the corresponding analogical structures. Yet another example is given by Figure 1, where sun can traverse to charge along multiple alternative paths of length three, implying the commutativity of relations surrounded by, made of , scale down.\nThe composition of two relations (linear maps) is naturally implemented via matrix multiplication (Yang et al., 2014; Guu et al., 2015), hence equation (4) indicates\nWr\u25e6r\u2032 =WrWr\u2032 =Wr\u2032Wr (5)\nOne may further require the commutative constraint (5) to be satisfied for any pair of relations inR because they may be simultaneously present in the same commutative parallelogram for certain subsets of entities. In this case, we say the relations inR form a commuting family.\nIt is worth mentioning thatNm(R) is not closed under matrix multiplication. As the result, the composition rule in eq. (5) may not always yield a legal new relation\u2014Wr\u25e6r\u2032 may no longer be a normal matrix. However, any commuting family inNm(R) is indeed closed under multiplication. This explains the necessity of having a commuting family of relations from an alternative perspective."}, {"heading": "3.3.

Efficient Inference Algorithm", "text": "The constrained optimization (7) is computationally challenging due to the large number of model parameters in tensor W , the matrix normality constraints, and the quadratic number of pairwise commutative constraints in (9).\nInterestingly, by exploiting the special properties of commuting normal matrices, we will show in Corollary 4.2.1 that ANALOGY can be alternatively solved via an another formulation of substantially lower complexity. Our findings are based on the following lemma and theorem:\nLemma 4.1. (Wilkinson & Wilkinson, 1965) For any real normal matrix A, there exists a real orthogonal matrix Q and a block-diagonal matrix B such that A = QBQ>, where each diagonal block of B is either (1) A real scalar,\nor (2) A 2-dimensional real matrix in the form of [ x \u2212y y x ] , where both x, y are real scalars.\nThe lemma suggests any real normal matrix can be blockdiagonalized into an almost-diagonal canonical form.\nTheorem 4.2 (Proof given in the supplementary material). If a set of real normal matrices A1, A2, ... form a commuting family, namely AiAj = AjAi \u2200i, j, then they can be block-diagonalized by the same real orthogonal basis Q.\nThe theorem above implies that the set of dense relational matrices {Wr}r\u2208R, if mutually commutative, can always be simultaneously block-diagonalized into another set of sparse almost-diagonal matrices {Br}r\u2208R. Corollary 4.2.1 (Alternative formulation for ANALOGY).

With the commutative constraints, there must exist some orthogonal matrix Q, such that Wr = QBrQ>, Br \u2208 Bnm, \u2200r \u2208 R.

A recommended remedy, which we followed, is to remove all training- and validation-set triples from all ranked lists during testing. We use \u201cfilt.\u201d and \u201craw\u201d to indicate the evaluation metrics with or without filtering, respectively.\nIn the first set of our experiments, we used on Hits@k with k=10, which has been reported for most methods in the literature.

We use asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for optimization, where the gradients with respect to different mini-batches are simultaneously evaluated in multiple threads, and the gradient updates for the shared model parameters are carried out without synchronization. Asynchronous SGD is highly efficient, and causes little performance drop when parameters associated with different mini-batches are mutually disjoint with a high probability (Recht et al., 2011). We adapt the learning rate based on historical gradients using AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011)."}, {"heading": "6.4.3.

For the methods not having both scores, the missing slots are indicated by \u201c\u2013\u201d. The best score on each dataset is marked in the bold face; if the differences among the top second or third scores are not statistically significant from the top one, then these scores are also bold faced. We used one-sample proportion test (Yang & Liu, 1999) at the 5% p-value level for testing the statistical significances3.\nTable 3 compares the methods (including ours) whose results in additional metrics are available. The usage of the bold faces is the same as those in Table 2.\nIn both tables, ANALOGY performs either the best or the 2nd best which is in the equivalent class with the best score in each case according statistical significance test. Specifically, on the harder FB15K dataset in Table 2, which has a very large number of relations, our model outperforms all baseline methods. These results provide a good evidence for the effective modeling of analogical structures in our approach. We are pleased to see in Table 3 that ANALOGY outperforms DistMult, ComplEx and HolE in all the metrics, as the latter three can be viewed as more constrained versions of our method (as discussed in (\u00a75)). Furthermore, our assertion on HolE for being a special case of ComplEx (\u00a75) is justified in the same table by the fact that the performance of HolE is dominated by ComplEx.\nIn Figure 3 we show the empirical scalability of ANALOGY, which not only completes one epoch in a few seconds on both datasets, but also scales linearly in the size of the embedding problem. As compared to single-threaded AdaGrad, our asynchronous AdaGrad over 16 CPU threads offers 11.4x and 8.3x speedup on FB15K and WN18, respectively, on a single commercial desktop.\n3Notice that proportion tests only apply to performance scores as proportions, including Hits@k, but are not applicable to nonproportional scores such as MRR. Hence we only conducted the proportion tests on the Hits@k scores."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusion", "text": "We presented a novel framework for explicitly modeling analogical structures in multi-relational embedding, along with a differentiable objective function and a linear-time inference algorithm for large-scale embedding of knowledge graphs. The proposed approach obtains the state-of-the-art results on two popular benchmark datasets, outperforming a large number of strong baselines in most cases.\nAlthough we only focused on the multi-relational inference for knowledge-base embedding, we believe that analogical structures exist in many other machine learning problems beyond the scope of this paper. We hope this work shed light on a broad range of important problems where scalable inference for analogical analysis would make an impact, such as machine translation and image captioning (both problems require modeling cross-domain analogies). We leave these interesting topics as our future work."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank the reviewers for their helpful comments.

An effective and scalable solution for this problem is crucial for the true success of knowledgebased inference in a broad range of applications. This paper proposes a novel framework for optimizing the latent representations with respect to the analogical properties of the embedded entities and relations. By formulating the learning objective in a differentiable fashion, our model enjoys both theoretical power and computational scalability, and significantly outperformed a large number of representative baseline methods on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the model offers an elegant unification of several well-known methods in multi-relational embedding, which can be proven to be special instantiations of our framework.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
