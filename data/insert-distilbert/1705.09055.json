This classifier may accept as inputs various characteristics about a candidate, such as their interview performance, qualifications, and years of experience. Suppose one of these characteristics is deemed sensitive, e.g. their race. Then, we might be required to constrain the classifier to not be overly discriminative with respect to this sensitive feature. Subject to this constraint, we would of course like our classifier to be as accurate as possible. This is known as the fairness-aware learning problem, and has received considerable attention in the machine learning community of late [Pedreshi et al., 2008, Kamiran and Calders, 2009, Calders and Verwer, 2010, Dwork et al., 2012, Kamishima et al., 2012, Fukuchi et al., 2013, Zafar et al., 2016, Hardt et al., 2016, Zafar et al., 2017]. The primary focus has been on formalising what constitutes a perfectly fair classifier, and how one learns a classifier to approximately achieve such fairness. There have been several distinct proposals in both regards (see \u00a72.2).\nIn this paper, we are interested in the tradeoffs inherent in the problem of learning with a fairness requirement. We specifically focus on the impact fairness has on two aspects of our original problem: the structure of the optimal solution, and the degradation in performance. Our three main contributions C1\u2014C3 comprise analyses of both issues:\nC1: we provide a reduction of two popular existing fairness measures to cost-sensitive risks (Lemmas 1, 2). C2: we show that for such cost-sensitive classification and fairness measures, the optimal fairness-aware classifier is an instance-dependent thresholding of the class-probability function (Propositions 3, 4). C3: we provide a measure of the alignment between the class-probabilities for the target and sensitive features,\nwhich quantifies the degradation in performance owing to the fairness requirement (Propositions 8, 9).\nA consequence of C1 is a simple procedure for learning with a fairness requirement, involving training separate class-probability estimators for the target and sensitive features, and combining them suitably (\u00a75.3). Underpinning our analysis is a general framework casting the fairness-aware learning problem as one of minimising the difference of two statistical risks (\u00a72.2), which allows for an abstract, generic treatment of the problem.\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n09 05\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n5 M\nay 2"}, {"heading": "2 Background and notation", "text": "We fix notation and review relevant background.

In standard learning from binary labels, we have samples from a distribution D over X \u00d7 {0, 1}, with (X,Y) \u223c D. Here, Y is some target feature we would like to predict, e.g. whether to hire a candidate. Our goal is to output a measurable randomised classifier parametrised by f : X\u2192 [0, 1] that distinguishes between positive (Y = 1) and negative (Y = 0) instances. A randomised classifier predicts any x \u2208 X to be positive with probability f (x); the quality of any such classifier is assessed by a statistical risk R(\u00b7; D) : [0, 1]X \u2192 R+ which, for some \u03a6 : [0, 1]3 \u2192 R+, is [Narasimhan et al., 2014]\nR( f ; D) .= \u03a6(FNR( f ; D), FPR( f ; D), P(Y = 1)),\nfor the false-negative and false-positive rates (FNR( f ; D), FPR( f ; D)) .= ( E\nX |Y=1 [1 \u2212 f (X)] , E X |Y=0 [ f (X)]\n) , (1)\nwhich are average class-conditional probabilities of error when classifying x \u2208 X as positive with probability f (x).\nExample 1. The cost-sensitive error with cost parameter c \u2208 (0, 1) is parametrised by \u03a6 : (u, v, p) 7\u2192 p \u00b7 (1 \u2212 c) \u00b7 u + (1 \u2212 p) \u00b7 c \u00b7 v. When c = P(Y = 1), this is a scaled version of the balanced error,\nRbal( f ; D) = (FNR( f ; D) + FPR( f ; D))/2. (2)\nA Bayes-optimal randomised classifier for a risk is any f \u2217 \u2208 Argmin R( f ; D). For a broad class of \u03a6, the optimal classifier is a (possibly distribution dependent) thresholding of the class-probability function, f \u2217(x) = n\u03b7(x) > t\u2217(D)o [Narasimhan et al., 2014], where \u03b7(x) .= P(Y = 1 | X = x) and n\u00b7o denotes the indicator function. For the cost-sensitive error with parameter c, the Bayes-optimal classifier is f \u2217(x) = n\u03b7(x) > co [Elkan, 2001]. These Bayes-optimal classifiers motivate a plugin estimator, where one thresholds an empirical estimate of \u03b7 [Narasimhan et al., 2014]."}, {"heading": "2.2 Fairness-aware learning", "text": "In fairness-aware learning, one modifies the standard problem of learning from binary labels in two ways. The statistical setup is modified by assuming that in addition to the target feature Y, there is some sensitive feature Y\u0304 we would like to treat in some special way, e.g. the race of a candidate. The classifier evaluation is modified by assuming that we reward classifiers that are \u201cfair\u201d in the treatment of Y\u0304. To make this goal concrete, the literature has studied notions of perfect and approximate fairness. (We construct a general formalism for the problem using these in Problem 1.)\nPerfect fairness. We will focus on two simple notions of perfect fairness, stated in terms of the random variables Y, Y\u0304, and classifier prediction Y\u0302 | X \u223c Bernoulli( f (X)). (Note that we assume Y\u0304 to be binary.) The first is demographic parity [Calders and Verwer, 2010], which requires the predictions to be independent of the sensitive feature: P(Y\u0302 = 1 | Y\u0304 = 0) = P(Y\u0302 = 1 | Y\u0304 = 1). (3) The second is equality of opportunity [Hardt et al., 2016], which requires the predictions to be independent of the sensitive feature, but only for the positive instances:\nP(Y\u0302 = 1 | Y = 1, Y\u0304 = 0) = P(Y\u0302 = 1 | Y = 1, Y\u0304 = 1).\nOther notions of perfect fairness include equalised odds [Hardt et al., 2016], and lack of disparate mistreatment [Zafar et al., 2017]. Demographic parity has received the most study; however, it is known to have deficiencies [Dwork et al., 2012, Hardt et al., 2016, Zafar et al., 2017].\nApproximate fairness. We will focus on two fairness measures that quantify the degree of fairness a given classifier possesses. The first is the disparate impact (DI) factor [Feldman et al., 2015], which is the ratio of the probabilities appearing in the definition of demographic parity:\nDI( f ) .= P(Y\u0302 = 1 | Y\u0304 = 0) P(Y\u0302 = 1 | Y\u0304 = 1) . (4)\nThe second is the mean difference (MD) score [Calders and Verwer, 2010], which replaces the ratio with a difference:\nMD( f ) .= P(Y\u0302 = 1 | Y\u0304 = 1) \u2212 P(Y\u0302 = 1 | Y\u0304 = 0). (5)\nWe refer the reader to \u017dliobaite\u0307 [2015] for a survey of other fairness measures, including variants of the above.\nA final remark is that the sensitive feature may or may not be available when one trains the classifier (see \u00a75.2). Avoiding the use of the sensitive feature by itself does not guard against discrimination [Pedreshi et al., 2008]."}, {"heading": "2.3 Existing work on fairness", "text": "Fairness has received considerable study in philosophy and welfare economics [Rawls, 1971, Sen, 2009]; however, with few exceptions [Bimore, 1994, Binmore, 2005], there is little formal utilitarian literature that grapples with fairness. See Appendix E for a more detailed overview.\nIn the machine learning community, Dwork et al. [2012] proposed an approach to guarantee fairness relying on a metric over instances. Zemel et al. [2013], Louizos et al. [2016] proposed approaches to learn feature representations that guarantee fairness. Both methods depend directly on the specific instances x \u2208 X. In contrast, our approach never touches the instances, but only risks; this has the substantial advantage of avoiding change under reparametrisation, and avoids the infinite regress of determining what is \u201csimilar\u201d."}, {"heading": "3 Fairness measures as statistical risks", "text": "We present our general view of fairness measures as statistical risks where the sensitive feature is the target. This lets us analyse fairness measures using tools for studying risks."}, {"heading": "3.1 General fairness measures", "text": "To formalise the notion of a fairness measure, we first specify our statistical setup for fairness-aware learning. Let Djnt be a joint distribution over X \u00d7 {0, 1} \u00d7 {0, 1}, with random variables (X, Y\u0304,Y) \u223c Djnt. Here, X\nrepresents the instance, Y the target feature, and Y\u0304 the sensitive feature. We will be interested in three induced distributions: we refer to P(X,Y) as D, P(X, Y\u0304) as D\u0304DP, and P(X, Y\u0304 | Y = 1) as D\u0304EO. We use D\u0304 to refer generically to either D\u0304DP or D\u0304EO.\nIn fairness-aware learning, our goal is to output a randomised classifier1 f : X\u2192 [0, 1] with small statistical risk on D, so that Y is well predicted; we will denote this risk by Rperf(\u00b7; D), and refer to it as a performance measure. In addition to this goal, we also want f to have large fairness measure Rfair(\u00b7; Djnt) : [0, 1]X \u2192 R+. Formally:\nProblem 1. Given a distribution Djnt, performance and fairness measures Rperf , Rfair, and tradeoff parameter \u03bb > 0, minimise the combined risk\nRfull( f ; Djnt, \u03bb) . = Rperf( f ; D) \u2212 \u03bb \u00b7 Rfair( f ; D\u0304). (6)\nWe will primarily focus on the following tractable special case of the above problem. (See \u00a76.1 for a slight variant.)"}, {"heading": "3.2 Classification-type fairness measures", "text": "In Problem 1, Rfair depends on Djnt, which is defined over the triplet (X, Y\u0304,Y). An interesting sub-class of Rfair are those that depend only on D\u0304DP, which is defined over the tuple (X, Y\u0304). As with Rperf , such Rfair can be written as a statistical risk on D\u0304DP: in particular, given some \u03a6fair : [0, 1]3 \u2192 R+, we may define a classification-type fairness measure via\nRfair( f ; D\u0304DP) . = \u03a6fair((FPR( f ; D\u0304DP), FNR( f ; D\u0304DP), P(Y\u0304 = 1))).\nIntuitively, we are testing whether we can predict the sensitive feature Y\u0304 from X. When it is possible to do so well according to Rfair, we do not have fairness.\nReturning to the two fairness measures of \u00a72.2, we observe that FPR( f ; D\u0304DP) = P(Y\u0302 = 1 | Y\u0304 = 0) and FNR( f ; D\u0304DP) = P(Y\u0302 = 0 | Y\u0304 = 1); thus, they are expressible as risks.\nExample 2. The disparate impact factor may be written\nDI( f ; D\u0304DP) . = FPR( f ; D\u0304DP) 1 \u2212 FNR( f ; D\u0304DP) , (7)\ni.e. it uses \u03a6fair : (u, v, p) 7\u2192 v1\u2212u .\nExample 3. The mean difference score may be written\nMD( f ; D\u0304DP) . = 1 \u2212 FNR( f ; D\u0304DP) \u2212 FPR( f ; D\u0304DP), (8)\ni.e. it uses \u03a6fair : (u, v, p) 7\u2192 1 \u2212 (u + v).\nWe make a few remarks on this class of fairness measures. First, by casting fairness measures as statistical risks, Equation 6 becomes the problem of minimising the difference of two statistical risks. This is a departure from standard tradeoffs between two risks, where one considers the sum rather than the difference; fairness measures are unusual as we seek to maximise the underlying risk Rfair.\nSecond, we can in principle plug-in any standard \u03a6fair and get a sensible measure of fairness. However, certain \u03a6fair may be more convenient to work with, e.g. from the point of view of interpretability; this is the case for disparate impact, which has roots in the 80% rule of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC, 1979].\n1Here and elsewhere, this is understood to mean a randomised classifier parametrised by f .\nThird, there is no requirement to restrict attention to D\u0304DP. In particular, we could equally use a risk on D\u0304EO, yielding\nRfair( f ; D\u0304EO) . = \u03a6fair((FPR( f ; D\u0304EO), FNR( f ; D\u0304EO), P(Y\u0304 = 1))),\nwhich aligns with the equality of opportunity objective.\nFourth, in general one needs to impose additional structure on Rfair to guarantee fairness, as we now discuss."}, {"heading": "3.3 Anti-classifiers and symmetrised fairness", "text": "Employing a statistical risk for Rfair in Equation 6 constrains the false-positive and negative rates. However, these constraints may assume our classifier is non-trivial on D\u0304DP; as an example, if a classifier f has MD( f ; D\u0304DP) = \u03c4, then MD(1 \u2212 f ; D\u0304DP) = 1 \u2212 \u03c4. Thus, one might be able to deceive such measures via an anti-classifier; i.e. one which has high fairness, but whose negation has low fairness.\nIntuitively, one wishes to disallow such a trivial transformation from adversely affecting fairness. A simple way to do this is to consider the symmetrised fairness measure\nR fair( f ; Djnt) . = Rfair( f ; Djnt) \u2227 Rfair(1 \u2212 f ; Djnt), (9)\nwhere \u2227 denotes the min operation. Maximising Equation 9 requires that both the classifier and the anti-classifier perform well. Such symmetrised measures simply modify the underlying \u03a6fair: note that FPR(1 \u2212 f ) = 1 \u2212 FPR( f ), and similarly for FNR(1 \u2212 f ). Thus, R fair is parametrised by\n\u03a6 fair(u, v, p) . = \u03a6fair(u, v, p) \u2227 \u03a6fair(1 \u2212 u, 1 \u2212 v, p).\nIn \u00a74.4, we show that a broad class of \u03a6fair have \u03a6 fair maximised when f \u2261 1/2; i.e. a completely random classifier is maximally fair. (We can equally enforce that f \u2261 \u03c0\u0304 is maximally fair via a simple correction; see Appendix C.)"}, {"heading": "3.4 Relation to existing work", "text": "The notion that statistical risks on D\u0304DP are suitable as fairness measures is implicit in prior surveys of such measures. Formalising this notion lets us subsequently use tools for studying risks to analyse a range of fairness measures.\nThe need for symmetrised fairness has not received much attention, with works employing the MD and DI scores e.g. Calders and Verwer [2010], Feldman et al. [2015] implicitly assuming that learned classifiers will perform better than random guessing on D\u0304DP."}, {"heading": "4 A cost-sensitive view of fairness measures", "text": "The previous section cast the DI and MD fairness measures as statistical risks on D\u0304.

(10)\nWhen c = 1/2, we get the balanced error (Equation 2). In general, this is simply a scaled and reparameterised version of the standard cost-sensitive risk: we have CS( f ; D, c) = (\u03b1+ \u03b2) \u00b7CSbal( f ; D, c\u2032), where \u03b1 = \u03c0 \u00b7 (1\u2212 c), \u03b2 = (1 \u2212 \u03c0) \u00b7 c, and c\u2032 = \u03b2/(\u03b1 + \u03b2). This reparameterisation will however prove convenient in analysing existing fairness measures."}, {"heading": "4.2 Disparate impact and cost-sensitive risk", "text": "Our first result is that the disparate impact factor (Equation 7) can be related to the balanced cost-sensitive risk.

This nonetheless means that a disparate impact constraint is equivalent to a cost-sensitive constraint, with the latter being easier to analyse.\nSecond, as Lemma 1 holds for any distribution D\u0304, we can plug in D\u0304EO, yielding an equivalent result for disparate impact in an \u201cequality of opportunity\u201d regime, i.e. DI( f ; D\u0304EO)."}, {"heading": "4.3 Mean difference score and balanced error", "text": "Our next result is that the mean difference score (Equation 8) has a strong connection to a balanced cost-sensitive risk.\nLemma 2.

Note that Equation 13 implies an equivalence of risks, and not just super-level sets.\nNote also that for the MD score, the corresponding balanced cost-sensitive risk has a cost-parameter that does not depend on the chosen \u03c4. This proves beneficial for the purposes of learning with this measure, as we shall see in \u00a75.3."}, {"heading": "4.4 The cost-sensitive fairness problem", "text": "The above results establish the versatility of cost-sensitive fairness measures. In the sequel, we will thus focus on such measures for general cost parameters, relying on Lemmas 1 and 2 to relate statements about them to statements about the DI and MD scores. For symmetry, we will also focus on cost-sensitive risks for the base problem, albeit with a possibly different cost parameter.\nThe above requires one tweak: as per \u00a73.3, it is desirable to work with symmetrised versions of any fairness measure. For general balanced cost-sensitive risks, these symmetrised versions have a simple form: it is an easy calculation that for any c \u2208 [0, 1] and classifier f , CSbal(1 \u2212 f ; D\u0304, c\u0304) = 1 \u2212 CSbal( f ; D\u0304, c\u0304).

(14)\nThis risk is maximised when CSbal( f ; D\u0304, c) = 1/2. A sufficient condition for this is f \u2261 1/2, so that, in line with our intuition, a completely random classifier is maximally fair.\nEquipped with this, we can formalise the special case of the general Problem 1 that is the focus of the sequel.\nProblem 2.

First, we use the standard rather than balanced cost-sensitive risk as it simplifies the analysis in subsequent sections; recall from \u00a74.1 that the two are related by a scaling and reparameterisation.\nSecond, Equation 15 employs the standard (non-symmetrised) cost-sensitive measure, but without a positivity constraint on \u03bb. This is because, by Equation 14, a constraint on the symmetrised risk imposes upper and lower bounds on the cost-sensitive risk. Then, \u03bb is the difference in the Lagrange multipliers for these two constraints, which need not be positive; see Appendix D for more discussion.\nThird, there is a subtlety in using Problem 2 as a proxy for the DI. As noted above, it is only the superlevel sets of the DI that are related to that of a cost-sensitive risk, and not the DI itself. This manifests in the cost parameter c\u0304 itself being a user-specified parameter, unlike for the MD score where it is fixed at 1/2.

For \u03bb , 0, however, we have an instance dependent threshold correction, which depends on \u03b7DP(x). The correction increases the standard threshold of c whenever \u03b7DP(x) > c\u0304; intuitively, when we are confident in the sensitive feature being active for an instance, we are more conservative in classifying the instance as positive.\nWe now consider a fairness measure that reflects the equality of opportunity notion, and thus works with D\u0304EO rather than D\u0304DP. This results in a slightly different Bayes-optimal classifier.\nProposition 4. Pick any Djnt, costs c, c\u0304 \u2208 [0, 1], and \u03bb \u2208 R.

Thus, analogously to the Bayes-optimal classifiers for standard statistical risks, this motivates a simple plugin estimation approach to fairness-aware learning problem: estimate \u03b7, \u03b7\u0304 separately, e.g. by logistic regression, and then combine them as per Equations 17, 18 to construct a classifier. When the sensitive feature is available, then all that is needed is a single model for \u03b7(x, y\u0304), which is thresholded separately for each of the sensitive feature values.\nWe make three comments on the proposed approach. First, one must of course tune \u03bb to achieve a desirable tradeoff between accuracy and fairness. This fortunately does not require retraining any model, as we can simply employ the learned \u03b7, \u03b7\u0304 and appropriately change how they are thresholded to form a classifier. One can tune \u03bb, so as to reach some desired operating point on the accuracy-fairness curve.\nSecond, if we find s\u2217(x) = 0 for some x \u2208 X, any prediction for that x optimises the objective of Equation 15; however, we may seek to tune this prediction to favour e.g. maximal performance on the original problem.\nThird, we reiterate that for the disparate impact, the cost parameter c\u0304 must be tuned as well, but that as per \u03bb, this does not require retraining any model."}, {"heading": "5.4 Relation to existing work", "text": "Computing the Bayes-optimal classifiers as above is not without precedent: Hardt et al. [2016], Corbett-Davies et al. [2017] considered the same question, but in the case of exact fairness measures. We are not aware of prior work on computing the optimal classifiers for approximate fairness measures. While the results have a similar flavour to the exact fairness case, explicating them is important to understand the full tradeoff between accuracy and fairness (\u00a76), and also suggests a simple algorithm.\nHardt et al. [2016] proposed to construct a fairness-aware classifier in the equality of opportunity setting by post-processing the results of a classifier trained on the original problem. They considered a slightly different constrained version of the problem, where one forces the solution to have perfect rather than approximate fairness. Our Propositions 3 and 4 provide an explicit form for the correction when approximate fairness is desired, as well as when the sensitive feature is available or not during training. Recently, Woodworth et al. Woodworth et al. [2017] established limits on the post-processing approach of Hardt et al. [2016]; studying this in our context of approximate fairness measures would be of interest.\nCalders and Verwer [2010] proposed to modify the output of na\u00efve Bayes so as to minimise the MD score. However, their approaches do have any theoretical guarantees.\nOur plugin learning procedure merely requires estimating class-probabilities, which for logistic regression is a convex problem. This avoids optimisation challenges facing existing approaches. For example, one way to approximately solve Equation 15 is to pick convex surrogate losses `, \u00af\u0300: {0, 1} \u00d7 R \u2192 R+, and find [Zafar et al., 2016, 2017]\ns\u2217 \u2208 Argmin s : X\u2192R CS(s; D, c, `) \u2212 \u03bb \u00b7 CS(s; D\u0304, c\u0304, \u00af\u0300)\nfor the surrogate cost-sensitive risk [Scott, 2012],\nCS(s; D, c, `) .= E (X,Y)\u223cD [CY \u00b7 `(Y, s(X))] (20)\nfor C1 = 1 \u2212 c,C0 = c. Note however that for nonlinear \u00af\u0300, this objective will be non-convex in s. Even if one manages to overcome this challenge, guaranteeing large surrogate fairness does not imply large fairness of the underlying classifier, as the former is an upper bound to the latter. Similar problems plague related approaches based on regularisation [Kamishima et al., 2012, Fukuchi et al., 2013]."}, {"heading": "6 Quantifying the accuracy-fairness tradeoff", "text": "We now study the tradeoff between performance on our base problem and fairness, and show it is quantifiable by a measure of alignment of the target and sensitive variables."}, {"heading": "6.1 The fairness frontier", "text": "Our definition of the fairness-aware learning problem (Problem 1) was in terms of a linear tradeoff between the performance and fairness measures. To quantify the tradeoff2 imposed by a fairness constraint, we will study the following explicitly constrained problem: for \u03c4 \u2208 [0, 1], let\nf \u2217\u03c4 \u2208 Argmin f : X\u2192[0,1] Rperf( f ; D) : R fair( f ; D\u0304) \u2265 \u03c4 (21) F(\u03c4) = Rperf( f \u2217\u03c4 ; D) \u2212 Rperf( f \u22170 ; D). (22)\nThe function F : [0, 1] \u2192 R+ represents the fairness frontier: for a given lower bound on (symmetrised) fairness, it measures the best excess risk over the solution without a fairness constraint. Evidently, F(\u00b7) is non-decreasing since the constraints on Rfair are nested as \u03c4 increases; i.e., demanding more fairness can never improve performance.\nAs per the previous section, the case of cost-sensitive performance and fairness measures is of interest. Here, the objectives in Equations 6 and 21 are related by the Lagrangian principle; see Appendix D for details. Further, when X is finite, Equation 21 reduces to a linear program. (For infinite X we obtain a semi-infinite linear program [Goberna and Lop\u00e9z, 1998], whose duality is subtler to analyse.)\nLemma 6. For finite X, pick any distribution Djnt, costs c, c\u0304 \u2208 [0, 1], and \u03c4 \u2208 R+.

We caution that this result requires equivalence of Rfair and a cost-sensitive risk, and so is not applicable for the DI factor.\nLemma 7. Pick any distribution Djnt, and cost-sensitive performance and fairness measures. Then, the function F : R+ \u2192 R+ of Equation 22 is convex.\nWhile Lemmas 6 and 7 are useful for computing the frontier, they do not specify how the curve\u2019s behaviour as \u03c4 is varied relates to properties of Djnt. We now study this issue."}, {"heading": "6.2 The frontier and class-probability alignment", "text": "To obtain our first distribution-dependent statement about the curve, observe that F(\u03c4) = 0 for any \u03c4 \u2208 [0, \u03c4\u2217], where \u03c4\u2217 = R fair( f \u2217 0 ; D\u0304). This simply means that there is no penalty from a fairness constraint when we consider the fairness attained by the Bayes-optimal classifier for the original problem. Intuitively, when D and D\u0304 are disaligned, we expect this \u03c4\u2217 to be large, so that there is no effect from virtually any fairness constraint.\nWe can formalise this notion of disalignment. Recall from Equation 16 that \u03b7, \u03b7\u0304 are the class-probabilities of the target and sensitive features respectively. With a cost-sensitive risk for Rperf , the Bayes-optimal classifier is f \u2217(x) = n\u03b7(x) > co. The incurred errors for predicting Y\u0304 with f \u2217 are then\nFPR( f \u2217; D\u0304) = 1 1 \u2212 \u03c0\u0304 \u00b7 EX [(1 \u2212 \u03b7\u0304(X)) \u00b7 n\u03b7(X) > co] FNR( f \u2217; D\u0304) = 1 \u03c0\u0304 \u00b7 E X [\u03b7\u0304(X) \u00b7 n\u03b7(X) < co] .\n(23)\nBoth these terms measure a form of disalignment of \u03b7 and \u03b7\u0304, specifically looking at the concentration of the latter in regions where the former is above or below the threshold c. If Rfair is parametrised by \u03a6fair, we then find\n\u03c4\u2217 = \u03a6 fair(FPR( f ; D\u0304), FNR( f ; D\u0304), \u03c0\u0304).\n2We stress that the tradeoff measured here is one inherent to the problem, rather than one owing to the technique one uses.\nFor generic \u03a6fair, we can plug in Equation 23 to get an explicit expression for \u03c4\u2217. In the case of cost-sensitive \u03a6fair, this expression involves a concrete measure of disalignment.\nProposition 8. Pick any distribution Djnt, and cost-sensitive performance and fairness measures with cost parameters c, c\u0304. Then, F(\u03c4) = 0 for any \u03c4 \u2208 [0, \u03c4\u2217], where\n\u03c4\u2217 = min(\u2206c, c\u0304(\u03b7\u0304, \u03b7),\u2206\u2212c, c\u0304(\u03b7\u0304,\u2212\u03b7)) \u2206c, c\u0304(\u03b7\u0304, \u03b7) = E\nX\n[ Bc, c\u0304(\u03b7\u0304(X), \u03b7(X)) ] \u2212 I\u03d5(P\u03041, P\u03040),\nwhere P\u0304y = P(X | Y\u0304 = y), I\u03d5(\u00b7, \u00b7) denotes an f -divergence,\n\u03d5(t) .= \u2212((1 \u2212 c\u0304) \u00b7 \u03c0\u0304 \u00b7 t) \u2227 (c\u0304 \u00b7 (1 \u2212 \u03c0\u0304)) Bc, c\u0304(\u03b7\u0304, \u03b7) . = |\u03b7\u0304 \u2212 c\u0304 | \u00b7 n(\u03b7\u0304 \u2212 c\u0304) \u00b7 (\u03b7 \u2212 c) < 0o. (24)\nUnpacking the above, Equation 24 gives a concrete notion of disalignment between \u03b7 and \u03b7\u0304 \u2013 which measures how much they disagree around the respective thresholds c and c\u0304 \u2013 and shows that when this disalignment is high, the fairness constraint has less of an effect. The additional f -divergence term is an intrinsic statement about D\u0304: when the class-conditionals of D\u0304 strongly overlap, i.e. there is limited predictability of the sensitive label from the features, then also the fairness constraint has less of an effect. Finally, the min(\u00b7, \u00b7) term arises from using symmetrised fairness.\nProposition 8 specifies how much fairness we can ask for without paying any performance penalty. When there is a penalty, however, how does this depend on Djnt? To understand this, we appeal to Bayes-optimal classifiers to Problem 2, whose closed form reveals that the frontier is determined by a similar notion of disalignment.\nProposition 9. Pick any Djnt, and cost-sensitive performance and fairness measures with parameters c, c\u0304. Given \u03c4 \u2208 [0, 1], there is some \u03bb \u2208 R and Bayes-optimal randomised classifier f \u2217 \u2208 Argmin\nf \u2208[0,1]X Rfull( f ; D, D\u0304, c, c\u0304, \u03bb) with\nF(\u03c4) = E X [(c \u2212 \u03b7(X)) \u00b7 ( f \u2217(X) \u2212 n\u03b7(X) > co)] .\nIf further this f \u2217 is deterministic i.e. Im( f \u2217) \u2286 {0, 1},\nF(\u03c4) = E X\n[ B\u03bb,c, c\u0304(\u03b7(X), \u03b7\u0304(X)) ] (25)\nwhere B\u03bb,c, c\u0304(\u00b7, \u00b7) is defined by\nB\u03bb,c, c\u0304(\u03b7, \u03b7\u0304) . = |\u03b7 \u2212 c | \u00b7 n(\u03b7 \u2212 c) \u00b7 (\u03b7 \u2212 c \u2212 \u03bb \u00b7 (\u03b7\u0304 \u2212 c\u0304)) < 0o.\nThe function B\u03bb,c, c\u0304(\u00b7, \u00b7) above has a similar flavour as Equation 24, and also measures the disalignment of \u03b7 and \u03b7\u0304 in terms of disagreement around respective thresholds c, c\u0304. However, there is additionally a dependence on \u03bb, which depends in some non-trivial manner on \u03c4. We note that the requirement that f \u2217 be deterministic may be dropped, at the expense of an additional term in Equation 25 that depends on the alignment of the non-deterministic component and \u03b7.\nWe make two final comments. First, the above result holds for both the MD and DI factor, as it only requires the superlevel sets to coincide with those of a cost-sensitive risk. Second, our notions of (dis)alignment are,\nroughly, analogous to the notion of compatibility functions in semi-supervised learning [Balcan and Blum, 2010], wherein one can guarantee that unlabelled data is useful when there is an alignment of the marginal data distribution with one\u2019s function class.\nTo get an intuitive feel for the disalignment function of Equation 24, we illustrate the frontier for some simple distributions. Consider first the case where X = [\u22121, 1], and D is such that \u03b7(x) = nx > 0o and the marginal over instances is uniform. Suppose also that \u03b7\u0304(x) = nx > to, for t some parameter to be specified. Consider a cost-sensitive performance and fairness measure with c = c\u0304 = 1/2. We can explicitly compute the frontier here, shown in Figure 1(a) for a range of t. As t increases, \u03b7 and \u03b7\u0304 grow increasingly dissimilar, and so the fairness constraint does not affect performance as dramatically: this is manifest in the fact that \u03c4\u2217 increases with t, as predicted by Equation 24. Further, for every t, when there is a tradeoff, it is linear.\nSuppose we instead have \u03b7(x) = (1 + exp(\u2212x))\u22121, and retain the same \u03b7\u0304. Here again, Figure 1(b) shows that as t increases, \u03b7 and \u03b7\u0304 grow increasingly dissimilar, and we find that \u03c4\u2217 again increases with t. The impact of changing the shape of \u03b7 is the effect on the frontier when it is nonzero: as per Equation 25, this depends on the deviation of \u03b7 from c, and hence the frontier here is nonlinear."}, {"heading": "7 Experiments", "text": "We present an experiment inspired by Feldman et al. [2015], who aimed to certify whether a dataset admits disparate impact (i.e. one can achieve DI( f ; D\u0304) \u2264 \u03c4 for fixed \u03c4) by testing if the minimal achievable balanced error is below some threshold (see Appendix F). Rather than employ the balanced error, we follow Lemma 1 and assess the minimal achievable balanced cost-sensitive risk for c = (1 + \u03c4)\u22121. Specifically, following Feldman et al. [2015], we consider the UCI german dataset with Y\u0304 denoting whether or not the age of a person is above 25, and fix \u03c4 = 0.8. For a number of train-test splits to be specified, we train models to minimise the cost-sensitive logistic loss with parameter c (Equation 20), and evaluate on the test set the disparate impact, as well as the gap \u2206( f ) .= CSbal( f ; D\u0304, c) \u2212 (1 \u2212 c). Our Lemma 1 indicates that we should find the latter to be positive only when the former is larger than \u03c4 = 0.8.\nTo construct our training sets, we make an initial 2:1 train-test split of the full data, treating Y\u0304 as the label to predict. To obtain models with varying levels of accuracy in predicting Y\u0304, we inject symmetric label noise of varying rates into the training (but not the test) set. Figure 6.2 shows that for the resulting models, as per Lemma 1, there is perfect agreement of disparate impact at \u03c4 = 0.8 and sign(\u2206( f )). We next present an experiment analogous to Zafar et al. [2016], where on the same german dataset we learn a classifier that respects a symmetrised MD score constraint, while being accurate for predicting the target variable in the sense of balanced error (BER). We employ the plugin estimator proposed in \u00a75.3, training logistic regression models to predict the target and sensitive variable and then combining them via Equation 17 for some \u03bb \u2208 R. On the test set, we compute the BER for the target variable, and the symmetrised MD score for the sensitive variable. We then employ the COV method of Zafar et al. [2016], which uses a surrogate to the MD constraint as discussed in \u00a75.4, with tuning parameter \u03c4 \u2208 R+ to control the MD score. Varying \u03bb and \u03c4 yields tradeoff curves for both methods. Figure 6.2 shows these curves at high fairness value, where we see that our plugin approach is generally competitive with COV, resulting in lower BER at higher\nfairness levels.

The result thus follows.\nProof of Proposition 8. As argued in the body, \u03c4\u2217 = R fair( f \u2217 0 ; D\u0304). Thus, it remains to compute this quantity. First, note that we may pick f \u22170 = n\u03b7(x) > co by Lemma 11.3 Next, observe that since Rfair is a cost-sensitive risk,\nRfair( f ; D\u0304) = Rfair( f ; D\u0304) \u2212min g Rfair(g; D\u0304) +min g Rfair( f ; D\u0304)\n= CS( f ; D\u0304, c\u0304) \u2212min g CS(g; D\u0304, c\u0304) +min g CS( f ; D\u0304, c\u0304) = E X [(c \u2212 \u03b7\u0304(X)) \u00b7 ( f (X) \u2212 n\u03b7\u0304(X) > co)] +min g CS( f ; D\u0304, c\u0304) by Lemma 12 .\nPlugging in f \u22170 , and applying the second statement of Lemma 12,\nRfair( f ; D\u0304) = E X [|\u03b7\u0304(X) \u2212 c | \u00b7 n(\u03b7\u0304(X) \u2212 c\u0304) \u00b7 (\u03b7(X) \u2212 c) < 0o] +min g CS( f ; D\u0304, c\u0304).\nNow we just apply Lemma 13 to the second term.\nProof of Proposition 9. Observe that f \u22170 \u2208 Argmin Rperf( f ; D). Consequently, the frontier may be re-written\nF(\u03c4) = reg( f \u2217\u03c4 ; D)\nwhere the regret or excess risk of a classifier is\nreg( f ; D) = Rperf( f ; D) \u2212 min g : X\u2192[0,1] Rperf(g; D).\nThis lets us specify the form of F(\u00b7) analytically when Rperf is a cost-sensitive risk. By Lemma 12,\nF(\u03c4) = E X\u223cM\n[ (c \u2212 \u03b7(X)) \u00b7 ( f \u2217\u03c4 (X) \u2212 n\u03b7(X) > co) ] .\n3The behaviour of optimal solutions at \u03b7(x) = c is unconstrained; however, different choices can in fact lead to different fairness values. Nonetheless, by picking a specific optimal solution, we are nonetheless guaranteed that picking \u03c4\u2217 as defined will yield zero risk.\nNow, since f \u2217\u03c4 is the solution to a linear program by Lemma 6, we can appeal to strong duality (see Appendix D) to conclude that there exists some \u03bb for which the corresponding soft-constrained version of the problem (Equation 15) has the same optimal value. This means there is some Bayes-optimal classifier f \u2217\u03bb to Equation 15 for which\nF(\u03c4) = E X\u223cM\n[ (c \u2212 \u03b7(X)) \u00b7 ( f \u2217\u03bb (X) \u2212 n\u03b7(X) > co) ] .\nNow, if additionally this f \u2217\u03bb is deterministic, then also by Lemma 12,\nF(\u03c4) = E X\u223cM\n[ |\u03b7(X) \u2212 c | \u00b7 n(\u03b7(X) \u2212 c) \u00b7 (2 f \u2217\u03bb (X) \u2212 1) < 0o ] .\nNow just plug in the definition of f \u2217\u03bb from Equations 18, 17."}, {"heading": "B Helper results", "text": "Lemma 10.

Clearly, it is optimal to predict f \u2217(x) = 1 when s\u2217(x) > 0, and f \u2217(x) = 0 when \u03b7(x) < c. When \u03b7(x) = c, any prediction is optimal.\nLemma 12.

ByLemma 11, an optimal classifier for Rperf(g; D) is the deterministic f \u2217(x) = n\u03b7(x) > co.

The difference f (x) \u2212 n\u03b7(x) > co takes on the value +1 when f (x) = 1 and \u03b7(x) < c, and \u22121 when f (x) = 0 and \u03b7(x) > c, i.e. the value sign(c \u2212 \u03b7(x)) when 2 f \u2212 1 and \u03b7(x) \u2212 c disagree in sign.

But what is fairness? Rawls develops a theory of fairness utilizing the \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d whereby a person\u2019s position in society is held to be unknown while designing the rules of a just society. The analogue in machine learning is that membership of a given category should not be used, one way or another, in determining outcomes for an individual. Analogous theories such as that of [Harsanyi, 1955] and [Sen, 2009] differ in what ignorance means (uniform prior over what role one has, or the perspective of a separate impartial observer). In all cases, the general idea is that a just outcome should not depend (either way) on membership of a particular category, but should focus upon the individual; Rawls [1971] motivates his approach by saying \u201cutilitarianism does not take seriously the distinction between persons\u201d (page 26) because it is only concerned with average welfare. While these ideas have had profound impact on political philosophy, their translation into mathematical theories is lacking. With few exceptions [Bimore, 1994, Binmore, 2005], there is little formal utilitarian literature that grapples with fairness.\nRawls argues the advantages of \u201cpure procedural justice\u201d where the attainment of justice (hence fairness) is a consequence of the process followed, not the outcome obtained. This is, of course, taken for granted in machine learning and statistics, where one analyses a procedure, not the results of the procedure on a given set of data. Taking this principle seriously means that protected attributes have to be identified ahead of time, and not after the fact because you did not like the outcome; confer the analogous problem in designing electoral districts: getting the process right makes the problem straightforward [Vickrey, 1961]; attempting to judge fairness a posteriori is a mess, with infinite arguments possible about whether a boundary is \u201cbizarre\u201d [Chambers and Miller, 2010].\nThe theory we present here follows the precept of Sen [2009, Chapter 18] that mere identification of \u201cfully just social arrangements is neither necessary nor sufficient.\u201d We embrace Sen\u2019s pragmatism by focussing on the quantifiable tradeoffs one might make to approach (certain notions of) fairness and hence justice. Rawls acknowledges that there will be tradeoffs between overall social utility and fairness (pp37ff) but tries to argue what the \u201cright\u201d tradeoff is. We do not try to solve that question, believing instead there is unlikely to be a universal right tradoff, and instead focus upon merely quantifying what the tradeoffs might be. Focussing upon quantifying the traedoff between utility and fairness has only very recently drawn attention in the machine learning literature [Johnson et al., 2016].\nThe approaches to fairness in the machine learning literature, which we follow in this paper, focusses on the notion of a protected attribute, and assumes that both its choice is manifest, and indeed it is a sensible categorisation (e.g. notions of race). One should take care with this though, because any such categories to which people are assigned to are not intrinsic to the world, but another choice that we make [Lakoff, 1987], which can be highly ambiguous and contested [Bowker and Star, 1999].\nSingling out particular attributes to be protected (as opposed to the rather more sweeping requirements of Rawls\u2019 full theory that requires no specific attributes be taken into account) opens the door to the problems inherent in the \u201cecological fallacy\u201d [Kramer, 1983] \u2014 making inferences about individuals based on membership in a category, which is precisely what some argue one should not do [Lippert-Rasmussen, 2011].\nIndeed the very notions of fairness studied in this paper glaringly fails the test against \u201cdiscrimination\u201d if one adopts a standard definition (e.g. from Wikipedia):\nIn human social affairs, discrimination is treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction in favour or against a person or thing based on the group, class, or category to which that person or thing is perceived to belong rather than on individual merit.\nBy that definition, the only non-discriminatory approach is to ignore the protected attributes entirely and take the outcome as it comes. Reconciling this tension remains a challenge!"}, {"heading": "F Relating disparate impact and balanced error", "text": "Following Feldman et al. [2015], we explore the relationship between the balanced error and disparate impact. Intuitively, we expect that when the balanced error of a classifier is low \u2013 meaning that the classifier accurately predicts the sensitive variable \u2013 we will have disparate impact. Conversely, we might hope that possessing disparate impact implies a low balanced error. Can we formalise a relationship akin to Lemma 2?\nWe have the following relations between the two quantities. In what follows, let\nBER( f ; D\u0304) = FPR( f ; D\u0304) + FNR( f ; D\u0304) 2 .\nLemma 15. Pick any distribution D\u0304 and randomised classifier f : X\u2192 [0, 1] with FNR( f ; D\u0304) , 1.

These are trivial consequences of the fact that, by definition of DI( f ; D\u0304) (Equation 7),\nFPR( f ; D\u0304) = (1 \u2212 FNR( f ; D\u0304)) \u00b7 DI( f ; D\u0304).\nWe now turn to relating a bound on the balanced error to a bound on the disparate impact factor. The following is a minor generalisation of Feldman et al. [2015, Theorem 4.1] to account for disparate impact at any level.\nLemma 16. Pick any distribution D\u0304 and randomised classifier f : X\u2192 [0, 1] with FNR( f ; D\u0304) , 1. Then, for any \u2208 [0, 12 ],\nBER( f ; D\u0304) \u2264 \u21d0\u21d2 DI( f ; D\u0304) \u2264 FPR( f ; D\u0304) 1 \u2212 2 \u00b7 + FPR( f ; D\u0304) \u2227 2 \u00b7 \u2212 FNR( f ; D\u0304) 1 \u2212 FNR( f ; D\u0304) ,\nand for any \u03c4 \u2208 [0, 1], DI( f ; D\u0304) \u2264 \u03c4 \u21d0\u21d2 BER( f ; D\u0304) \u2264 ( \u03c4\n2 + 1 \u2212 \u03c4 2 \u00b7 FNR( f ; D\u0304)\n) \u2227 ( 1 2 \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03c4 2 \u00b7 \u03c4 \u00b7 FPR( f ; D\u0304) ) .\nProof of Lemma 16. The first equivalence follows from the two expressions in Equation 27, and the fact that the dependence on BER( f ; D\u0304) is monotone increasing. This second equivalence follows from the two expressions in Equation 28, and the fact that the dependence on DI( f ; D\u0304) is monotone increasing.\nWhen \u03c4 = 0.8, this means that DI( f ; D\u0304) \u2264 0.8 \u21d0\u21d2 BER( f ; D\u0304) \u2264 (\n2 5 + 1 10 \u00b7 FNR( f ; D\u0304)\n) \u2227 ( 1 2 \u2212 1 8 \u00b7 FPR( f ; D\u0304) ) .\nF.1 Low balanced error implies disparate impact\nIt is of interest to remove the dependence of the above bounds on the false positive and negative rates of f . For one direction, this is possible.\nCorollary 17. Pick any distribution D\u0304 and randomised classifier f : X\u2192 [0, 1] with FNR( f ; D\u0304) , 1. Then, for any \u2208 [0, 12 ],\nBER( f ; D\u0304) \u2264 =\u21d2 DI( f ; D\u0304) \u2264 2 \u00b7 ,\nor for any \u03c4 \u2208 [0, 1], DI( f ; D\u0304) \u2265 \u03c4 =\u21d2 BER( f ; D\u0304) \u2265 \u03c4\n2 .\nProof. The first bound follows from Lemma 16 and the fact that if BER( f ; D\u0304) \u2264 , it must be true that FPR( f ; D\u0304) \u2228 FNR( f ; D\u0304) \u2264 2 \u00b7 . The second bound is the contrapositive of the first.\nCorollary 17 says that with a balanced error of \u03c42 or less, we are guaranteed a disparate impact of level at least \u03c4, though possibly worse. So, if we want to guarantee a lack of disparate impact at level \u03c4, it is necessary that the balanced error be at least \u03c42 . But is this condition also sufficient? Unfortunately, it is not.\nF.2 Disparate impact does not imply low balanced error\nIt is evident from Lemma 16 that regardless of the precise level of impact \u03c4, we could have a classifier with balanced error arbitrarily close to 12 . The basic issue is that by driving the false positive rate to 0, we trivially have disparate impact. By further driving the false negative rate to 0 (i.e. by predicting everything negative), we trivially have a balanced error rate of 12 .\nCorollary 18. Pick any distribution D\u0304. Then, for any \u03c4 \u2208 [0, 1] there exists a classifier f : X\u2192 {0, 1} with\nBER( f ; D\u0304) = 1 2\nDI( f ; D\u0304) \u2264 \u03c4.\nProof. Consider the trivial classifier with FPR( f ; D\u0304) = 0\nFNR( f ; D\u0304) = 1.\nClearly, this has balanced error 12 . Evidently, this classifier also has disparate impact at level \u03c4.\nCorollary 18 says that even if we have a classifier with high balanced error, there is no guarantee it will not have disparate impact. This is a worst case analysis over all possible classifiers we might have obtained. However, if we happen to know the false positive and negative rates we actually have obtained, we might be able to conclude there is no disparate impact. This is used in Feldman et al. [2015, Section 4.2] to certify the lack of disparate impact for a particular classifier.\nCorollary 19. Pick any distribution D\u0304 and randomised classifier f : X\u2192 [0, 1]. For any \u03c4 \u2208 [0, 1], BER( f ; D\u0304) \u2265 ( \u03c4\n2 + 1 \u2212 \u03c4 2 \u00b7 FNR( f ; D\u0304)\n) \u2227 ( 1 2 \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03c4 2 \u00b7 \u03c4 \u00b7 FPR( f ; D\u0304) ) \u21d0\u21d2 DI( f ; D\u0304) \u2265 \u03c4.\nProof of Corollary 19.
