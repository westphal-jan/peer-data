In terms of the amount of accessible music, the advent of online music services (e.g., Last.fm1, Pandora2, and Spotify3) has made it possible for people to access millions of songs on the Internet, and it has become popular to play music using such services rather than physical media like CDs [8]. When users play music online, such services record personal musical play logs that show when users listen to music and what they listen to.\nSince personal music play logs have become available, it has become popular to use session information to analyze and model people\u2019s music listening behavior [2,4,13,18]. Here, a session is a sequence of logs within a given time frame. Zheleva et al. [18] were the first to model listening behavior using a topic model based on session information. They revealed that a user tends to choose songs in a session according to the session\u2019s specific topic such as rock or jazz. However, it is not always correct to assume that a user chooses songs according to the session\u2019s topic. For example, after a user buys an\n1 http://www.last.fm 2 http://www.pandora.com 3 http://www.spotify.com\nartist\u2019s album or temporarily falls in love with an artist, s/he will be addicted to the artist and repeatedly listen to the artist\u2019s songs regardless of topic.\nIn light of the above, this paper proposes a model that can deal with both a session topic and addiction to artists. Our proposed model uses the model proposed by Zheleva et al. [18] as the starting point. We present each song-listening instance in terms of the corresponding song artist. In our model, each user has a distribution over topics that reflects the user\u2019s usual taste in music and a distribution over artists that reflects the user\u2019s addiction to artists. In addition, each user has a different ratio between usual taste and addiction, and probabilistically chooses a song in a session based on this ratio. That is, if a user has a high addiction ratio, s/he will probably choose a song of an artist from his/her artist distribution for addiction. Modeling people\u2019s music listening behavior by considering addiction is worth studying from various viewpoints:\n\u2013 Our model can show topic characteristics (e.g., the rock topic has a high ratio of\naddiction) and artist characteristics (e.g., most users choose an artist\u2019s songs when addicted to that artist). It is important to understand such characteristics from the social scientific viewpoint. \u2013 Our model can also show user characteristics (e.g., a user chooses songs based on\naddiction in a session). There are many applications that could use this data such as advertisements and recommendation systems. For example, if a user chooses songs of an artist based on addiction in a session, it would be useful to recommend songs of that artist; if s/he chooses songs based on a topic, it would be better to recommend other artists\u2019 songs in the same topic.\nOur main contributions in this paper are as follows.\n\u2013 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study modeling music listening be-\nhavior by considering both the usual taste in music and the addiction to artists.\n\u2013 We quantitatively evaluated our model by using real-world music play logs of two\nmusic online services. Our experimental results show that the model adopting both factors achieves the best results in terms of the perplexity computed by using test data. \u2013 We carried out qualitative experiments in terms of user characteristics, artist char-\nacteristics, and topic characteristics and show that our model can be used to analyze people\u2019s music listening behavior from a new viewpoint.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents related work on analyzing music play logs and on modeling music listening behavior. Section 3 describes the model that extends the model by Zheleva et al. [18] by considering the addiction phenomenon. Section 4 presents a procedure to infer the parameters. Section 5 and 6 report on our quantitative and qualitative experiments, respectively.

Rentfrow and Gosling [14] carried out a questionnaire-based survey and revealed the correlations between music preferences and personality, self-views (e.g., wealthy and politically liberal), and cognitive ability (e.g., verbal skills and analytical skills). Renyolds et al. [15] made an online survey and reported that environmental metadata such as the user\u2019s activity, weather, and location affect the user\u2019s music selection. Analysis by Berkers [3] using Last.fm play logs showed the significant differences between male and female in terms of their music genre preferences. More recently, Lee et al. [10] collected responses from users of commercial cloud music services and reported the criteria for generating playlists: personal preference, mood, genre/style, artists, etc. Among various factors, time information has received a lot of attention. Herrera et al. [6] analyzed play counts from Last.fm and discovered that a non-negligible number of listeners listen to certain artists and genres at specific moments of the day and/or on certain days of the week. Park and Kahng [12] used log data of a commercial online music service in Korea and showed that there existed seasonal and time-of-day effects on users\u2019 music preference. Baur et al. [2] also showed the importance of seasonal aspects, which influence music listening, using play logs from Last.fm.\nIn spite of the variety of listening behavior analyses, to the best of our knowledge, no work has focused on users\u2019 addiction to, for example, songs and artists. In this work, we deal with this factor and analyze people\u2019s music listening behavior from a new perspective."}, {"heading": "2.2 Application Based on Music Listening Logs", "text": "Listening logs have been used for various applications, including the detection of similar artists. Schedl and Hauger [17] crawled Twitter4 for the hash tag #nowplaying and computed artist similarity using co-occurrence-based methods. Their experimental results showed that listening logs can be used to derive similarity measures for artists. Another application is playlist generation. Liu et al. [11] proposed a playlist generation system informed by time stamps of a user\u2019s listening logs in addition to the user\u2019s music rating history and audio features such as wave forms. The most popular application is music recommendation. Since personal music play logs have become available, it has become popular to use session information to recommend songs. Park et al. [13] proposed Session-based Collaborative Filtering (SSCF), which extends traditional collaborative filtering techniques by using preferred songs in the similar session. Dias and Fonseca [4] proposed temporal SSCF, where for each session, a feature vector is created consisting of five properties including time of day and song diversity. The work closest to ours is that of Zheleva et al. [18], who proposed a statistical model to describe patterns of song listening. They showed that a user tends to choose songs in a session according to the session\u2019s specific topic. We will describe the details of their model in Section 3.2.\n4 http://twitter.com/\nAlthough none of these applications used addiction information, we believe that this information could improve the usefulness of these applications.

Without loss of generality, we assume that play logs are sorted in ascending order of their timestamps: tun < tun\u2032 for n < n \u2032.\nTo capture user\u2019s listening preferences over time, we divide user\u2019s play logs into sessions. Following Zheleva et al. [18] and Baur et al. [2], we use the time gap approach to generate sessions. If the gap between tun and tun+1 is less than 30 minutes, lun and lun+1 belong to the same session; otherwise, they belong to different sessions. Let Sur be the rth session of u where Sur consists of one or more of u\u2019s logs. Let Ru be the total number of u\u2019s sessions; then the set of u\u2019s sessions is given by Du = {Sur} Ru r=1.

[18], which is called the session model, is a probabilistic graphical model based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [1].

[18] reported the usefulness of generating played songs based on a session\u2019s topic, we hypothesize that users can choose a song independently of topic. For example, after a user buys an artist\u2019s album or temporarily falls in love with an artist, s/he will repeatedly listen to the artist\u2019s songs regardless of the topic. In other words, the user can be addicted to some artists. In such an addiction mode, we assume that the user directly chooses a song without going through the topic.\nIn light of the above, our model takes both session-topic-based and addiction-based choices of songs. Figure 1(b) shows the graphical model of our proposed model. Each user has a Bernoulli distribution \u03bb that controls the weights of influence for a session topic and addiction. To be more specific, when user u chooses a song in a session, we assume that the choice is influenced by the session topic with probability \u03bbu0 (x = 0) and by u\u2019s addiction to the artist with probability \u03bbu1 (x = 1), where \u03bbu0 + \u03bbu1 = 1. When x = 0, a song is generated through the same process of the session model, while when x = 1, a song is directly generated from a user-artist distribution \u03c8.

The first one is created from music play logs on a music download service in Japan. On the service, users can buy a single song and an album and listen to them. For this evaluation, we obtained 10 weeks of log data between 1/1/2016 and 10/3/2016.We call this dataset JPD. The second one consists of logs on Last.fm. To guarantee the repeatability, we used a publicly available music play log data on Last.fm provided by Schedl [16]. Similar with JPD, we extracted 10 weeks of log data between 1/1/2013 and 11/3/2013; we call the dataset LFMD.\nFrom the 10 weeks of data of JPD, we created two pairs of training and test datasets as follows. In the first/second dataset, the training dataset consists of logs of the first four/eight weeks and the test dataset consists of the next two weeks. For each dataset, we excluded artists whose songs were played by \u2264 3 users and created session data as described in Section 3.1.

In addition, in the SWA model, we set \u03b3 = 50|A| and \u03c1 = 0.5.\nTo compare the performance of the session model and the SWA model, we use the perplexities of the two models.

In any dataset, regardless of the amount of training data and the number of topics, the SWA model outperformed the session model. If we set the number of topics to be larger than 300, the session model might outperform the SWA model; but we set the maximum value ofK to 300 for the following two reasons. The first reason is due to the expended hours for the learning process. For example, when the session model learns parameters for K = 300 using 8WJPD, it takes 9.8 times longer than the SWA model does for K = 30 using 8WJPD (1,713 minutes for the session model and 175 minutes for the SWA model). In data analysis, the expended hours is an important factor; if it takes a long time to learn the parameters for a model, the model is inappropriate for data analysis. The second reason is due to the understandability of topics. When the number of topics becomes too large, it is difficult to understand the difference between topics because there are many similar topics. As we will show in Section 6.3, analyzing the characteristics of each topic is useful to understand people\u2019s music listening behavior. Hence, it is undesirable to set K to a large value.

Given a user u, we can obtain the ratio of these two factors from Equation (7), where \u03bbu0 + \u03bbu1 = 1. Figure 3 (a) shows a histogram based on the degree of addiction. Although most people put a high priority on their usual taste in music (ratio \u2264 0.1), the second highest histogram peak is for those who put the greatest weight on addiction to artists (ratio > 0.9). The result where so many users lie somewhere between these two extremes of behavior further indicates the usefulness of considering the addiction mode in music listening behavior.\nBy using the posterior distribution of latent variables in Equation (4) and (5), we can analyze the relationship between the degree of addiction and the time. We first analyzed the transition of the degree of addiction on a per-hour basis. For example, to analyze the degree between 9:00:00 and 9:59:59, we collected all play logs during the time period in the training data. By summing p(x = 0) of all logs, we can obtain the strength of usual taste in music during the time period. Similarly, by summing p(x = 1) of all logs, we can obtain the strength of addiction during the time period. Finally, we normalize their sum to 1 so that we can see the ratio of the degree of the two factors. The left line chart in Figure 4 shows the results. It can be observed that the degree of addiction is high in the early morning (i.e., at 5, 6, and 7 am), while it is low at night (i.e., at 9, 10, and 11 pm). We can estimate that people tend to be short on time in the morning, and as a result, they listen to a specific artist\u2019s songs rather than choosing various songs\naccording to a topic. On the other hand, at night, people have time to spare and tend to listen to various artists\u2019 songs by choosing from a topic. These results indicate that the transition of the degree of addiction on a per-hour basis enables us to analyze people\u2019s music listening behavior from a new viewpoint. In addition, we propose applying the knowledge to music recommendation. For example, it would be more appropriate to recommend unknown songs to the user at night rather than in the morning because s/he would have time to try listening to new songs.\nIn the same manner as the above analysis, we also analyzed the transition of the degree of addiction on a day of the week basis. The right line chart in Figure 4 shows the result. It can be observed that the degree of addiction is high on weekdays, while it is low on weekends. We can also estimate that the degree of addiction is high on weekdays because people are busy working on weekdays, while the degree is low on weekends because people have more time. These results would also be useful to recommend music."}, {"heading": "6.2 Artist Characteristics", "text": "In the same way as Section 6.1, given an artist, by summing p(x = 0) and p(x = 1) of all the artist\u2019s logs, we can obtain the strength of usual taste and addiction during the time period, respectively. Then their sum is normalized to 1 to compute the ratio of each factor of the artist. Figure 3 (b) shows a histogram based on the degree of addiction. It can be observed that most artists have a high degree of addiction. From these results, we can estimate whether the artist\u2019s songs are repeatedly played by users who are enthusiastic admirers of the artist or by various users who listen to the artist\u2019s songs with other artists\u2019 songs. In addition, we believe that the results could be used as\none of the features to compute the similarity between artists by assuming that similar artists have similar degrees of addiction."}, {"heading": "6.3 Topic Characteristics", "text": "Finally, we show that our model can also be used for topic analysis. Given a topic k, we collected representative artists in the category. To be more specific, the top 20 artists in terms of \u03c6k were extracted. For each of the 20 artists, we collected all logs in the training data and computed the ratio of the degree of taste in music and addiction as described in Section 6.1. We then computed the average values of each degree over 20 artists and normalized their sum to 1. Figure 5 shows the ratio of 30 topics, where topics are sorted in ascending order of addiction ratio. As can be seen, the ratio between two factors is largely different from one topic to another: the addiction ratio ranged from 0.297 (10th topic) to 0.620 (17th topic). As for the low addiction topics, the 10th topic has the lowest value of 0.297. This topic is related to songs created by using VOCALOID [9], which is popular singing synthesizer software in Japan. The 8th topic has the second lowest value of 0.334 and its topic is related to anime songs. From these results, we can estimate that when people listen to music related to popular culture, they tend to listen to various artists\u2019 songs in the topic. As for the high addiction topic, the 17th topic, which is related to Western artists, and the 28th topic, which is related to old Japanese artists, have the highest values of 0.620 and 0.592, respectively. These results indicate the possibility of applying the knowledge to playlist generation. In topics with a high addiction degree, it would be useful to generate a playlist that consists of songs of a specific artist; while in topics with a low addiction degree, it would be useful to generate a playlist that consists of various artists\u2019 songs."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we proposed a probabilistic model for analyzing people\u2019s music listening behavior. The model incorporates the user\u2019s usual taste in music and addiction to artists. Our experimental results using real-world music play logs showed that our model outperformed an existing model that considers only the user\u2019s taste in terms of perplexity. In our qualitative experiments, we showed the usefulness of our model in various aspects: time-dependent play log analysis (e.g., the degree of addiction is high in the\nearly morning and on weekdays), topic-dependent play log analysis (e.g., the degree of addiction is low in an anime song topic), etc.\nFor future work, we are interested in applying the knowledge obtained from log analysis to applications such as artist similarity computation and song recommendation as discussed in Section 6. We are also interested in extending our model by considering the time transition of addiction. For example, a user who is addicted to some artists in summer may be addicted to largely different artists in autumn. Considering such time dependency by using the topic tracking model [7] is one possible direction to take to extend our model."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work was supported in part by ACCEL, JST."}], "references": [{"title": "Mixed membership stochastic blockmodels", "author": ["E.M.

They enable us to analyze people\u2019s music listening behavior based on play logs. Although it is known that people listen to music based on topic (e.g., rock or jazz), we assume that when a user is addicted to an artist, s/he chooses the artist\u2019s songs regardless of topic. Based on this assumption, in this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to analyze people\u2019s music listening behavior. Our main contributions are threefold. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study modeling music listening behavior by taking into account the influence of addiction to artists. Second, by using real-world datasets of play logs, we showed the effectiveness of our proposed model. Third, we carried out qualitative experiments and showed that taking addiction into account enables us to analyze music listening behavior from a new viewpoint in terms of how people listen to music according to the time of day, how an artist\u2019s songs are listened to by people, etc. We also discuss the possibility of applying the analysis results to applications such as artist similarity computation and song recommendation.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
