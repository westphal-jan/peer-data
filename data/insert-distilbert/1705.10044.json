We may code an act of it into A:a1\u00a9 d B:a2\u00a9 (a1 B:a3\u00a9 with the following intended meaning: some agent A\u2019s argument a1 persuades an agent B into holding a3; B, being persuaded, drops a2. There can be various reasons for the persuasive act. It may be that A is a great teacher wanting to correct some inadvisable norm of B\u2019s, or perhaps A is a manipulator who benefits if a2 is not present. Persuasion is popularly observed in social forums including YouTube and Twitter, and methods to represent it will help understand users\u2019 views on topics accurately. Another less pervasive form of persuasion is possible: A:a1\u00a9 (a1 B:a3\u00a9 in which A persuades B with a1 into expressing a3 but without conversion. Like this manner, persuasion acts as a dynamics modifier in rhetoric argumentation, allowing some argument to appear and disappear.\nOf course, these acts will not be successful if a1 is found to be not an acceptable argument: we may have C:a3\u00a9 \u2192 A:a1\u00a9 (a1 B:a2\u00a9 where a3 attacks a1, in which case B is not persuaded into holding a2. For judging the success of a persuasion act based on other arguments, the theoretical framework of abstract argumentation by Dung [17] is viable, as it facilitates acceptability of a set of arguments when attacks among them are given. We incorporate the persuasion acts into argumentation frameworks, and study how they influence abstract argumentation frameworks. Overall, our frameworks are to Dung\u2019s frameworks broadly what dynamic epistemic logic is to epistemic logic, in the very sense that dynamic operators are embedded in a language (framework).

Bridging dynamics and statics is important for detailed and more precise analysis of rhetoric argumentation. We formulate the notion of admissibility in our frameworks, and then show a way of enriching it into other types of admissibilities through CTL (computation tree logic) embedding."}, {"heading": "1.1 Example situations", "text": "Animal Farm (George Orwell, 1945), a satirical novella, illustrates how easy it is for a power to control social norms. Though written to general audience, it features many critical components of rhetoric argumentation such as the use of pseudo-logic, scapegoating, and half-truths [13], to persuade other agents. In the story, farm animals chase away their farm owner Jones to govern the farm themselves free of human tyranny. They institute norms, among which is All animals are equal, to be followed by all animals. Pigs take on a leading role of indoctrinating other animals and of running the farm, gradually gaining a dominant influence over other animals, however. Ultimately they rectify the above-stated norm into All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others, reinstating the tyranny against which the farm animals once united. We extract some arguments from the novella.\na1 Where Jones is, there is tyranny. a2 It is necessary to keep pigs in good health. a3 All animals are equal. a4 All animals are equal but pigs can have apples and milk. a5 Apples and milk shall be consumed by pigs. a6 Science proves that pigs cannot go by without apples and milk. a7 Surely there is no one among you who wants to see Jones back?\nAccording to the progression of the story, a1 is the belief firmly held by all animals. a3 is one of the seven principles set forth. Pigs begin to consume all apples and milk (a5), against which other animals express dissent, which is represented with the attack arrow in the drawing. One of the pigs demonstrate a6 by pseudo-logic as well as threaten them of Jones\u2019 return (a7). The three arguments a1, a6\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n10 04\n4v 2\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 J\nun 2\n01 7\nand a7 persuade animals to believe a2 (passive persuasion act). Then a2 accommodates modification of a3 into a4 smoothly (active persuasion act). In the end, animals believe a4 and forget a3. They also keep a1, a2, a6 and a7, and are content with a5, of course.\nWe have a kind of concurrency scenario when multiple persuasions into different arguments are acting on an agent. Let us consider another example.\na1 (Alice at London Bridge, having agreed to see Bob at 7 pm) I am going to have dinner with Bob. It is 7 pm now. He should be arriving soon.\na2 (Tom, calling from Camden) Chris (Alice\u2019s brother) is looking for you. He is at Camden Bar. He says there is some urgent matter. So can you please get to the bar as soon as possible?\na3 (Katie, seeing Alice by chance) Hey Alice, you\u2019ve left your laptop at King\u2019s library? You better go there now. Oh, and don\u2019t forget about your presentation tomorrow morning. Make sure you have slides ready!\nHaving been acquainted with Bob only recently, Alice is more inclined to getting to Camden Bar or to King\u2019s library. That is, a4: I am going to Camden Bar, or a5: I am going to King\u2019s library. She knows her brother is very stern. But the assignment of which Katie reminded Alice seems to be a thing that must be prioritised, too. Whichever option she is to go for, she must, thinks she, come up with excuses to justify her choice. Therefore:\na6 (Alice\u2019s excuse) It is fine to skip dinner because I waited for Bob at London Bridge and he did not arrive in time. Besides, I suddenly had something urgent.\na7 (Alice\u2019s excuse) I cannot see Chris. For my career, it is important that I perform well at presentation tomorrow. Chris will understand.\na8 (Alice\u2019s excuse) I cannot go to King\u2019s library now, because it is always urgent when Chris calls me.\nThe above figure represents these arguments. Now, what we have is a potentially irreversible branching. If a2 persuades a1 into a4, it is no longer possible for a3 to persuade a1, as a1 will not be available for persuasion. If a3 persuades a1 into a5, on the other hand, it is no longer possible that a2 persuades a1. A certain partial order may be defined among persuasion (like in preference-based argumentation), but the non-deterministic consideration leads to a more general theory (like in probabilistic argumentation) in which the actual behaviour of a system is dependent on run-time executions. Just as in program analysis, however, it may be still possible to identify certain\nproperties, whichever an actual path may be. In this particular example, (Alice holding) a1 may be persuaded into holding a4 or else a5, and we cannot tell which with certainty. However, we can certainly predict a6\u2019s emergence. Our interests are in obtaining varieties in arguments admissibility so that such a query as \u2018Is a6 going to be an admissible argument in whatever order persuasive acts may take place?\u2019 is possible."}, {"heading": "2 TECHNICAL BACKGROUNDS", "text": "In Dung\u2019s abstract argumentation [17], an argumentation framework is a tuple (A,R) where A is (usually) a finite set of arguments (and in the rest any A with or without a subscript is assumed to be a set of arguments) while R is a binary relation over A, the class of all arguments. An argument a1(\u2208 A) is said to attack another argument a2(\u2208 A) if and only if, or iff, (a1,a2) \u2208 R. A subset A1 of A is said to accept, synonymously to defend, ax \u2208 A iff it is possible to find some az \u2208 A1 for each ay \u2208 A attacking ax such that az attacks ax . A subset A1 of A is said to be: conflict-free iff no element of A1 attacks an element of A1; admissible iff it is conflict-free and it accepts all the elements of A1; complete iff it is admissible and includes any argument it defends; preferred iff it is a set-theoretically maximal admissible set; stable iff it is preferred and attacks every argument in A\\A1; and grounded iff it is the set intersection of all complete sets of A."}, {"heading": "3 ABSTRACT ARGUMENTATION WITH PERSUASION", "text": "Instead of the Dung binary relation, we use a ternary relation: R : A \u00d7 (A \u222a \u03f5) \u00d7 (A \u222a \u03f5) such that (a1, \u03f5,a2) \u2208 R represents a1\u00a9 (a1 a2\u00a9 (passive persuasion or to induce), (a1,a2,a3) \u2208 R represents a1\u00a9 d a2\u00a9 (a1 a3\u00a9 (active persuasion or to convert), and (a1,a2, \u03f5) \u2208 R represents a1\u00a9 \u2192 a2\u00a9 (attack). Let us term this abstract argumentation with persuasion as APA (Abstract Persuasion Argumentation). An APA framework is a (AI,A,R, \u21aa\u2192) for AI \u2286 A and \u21aa\u2192\u2286 2A \u00d7 (2A \u00d7 2A ). AI is the set of all initially visible arguments. It corresponds to the set of initial states in a state transition system. As in a transition system, a transition occurs in APA framework, too, modifying one set of all visible arguments to \u2018a\u2019 next set of all visible arguments. \u21aa\u2192 is the transition relation. The first component of the Cartesian product is for relativising the transition judgement to a reference arguments set, in particular, to visible arguments of the reference set. There is nothing new in the relativisation: we saw in Section 2 that judgement of acceptance of an argument ax was relative to some set of arguments A1. Elements of \u21aa\u2192 are derived constructively from AI for each reference arguments set, and to determine them, we only need to calculate all the next sets of visible arguments from a given set of all visible arguments. Therefore, at present, let us just assume VisA to be the set of all \u2018currently\u2019 visible arguments, which equates to AI initially. If A1 \u21aa\u2192Ax Ay (which is another way of stating (Ax , (A1,Ay )) \u2208\u21aa\u2192 in this paper), Ay becomes VisA after the transition.\nTo define the function that does the one-step calculation, we first of all obtain all possible persuasion acts for each reference arguments set A1. We say that a persuasion act (a1,\u03b1 ,a2) \u2208 R for \u03b1 \u2208 {\u03f5} \u222aA is possible at VisA (\u2018at VisA\u2019 means when the set of all visible arguments is currently VisA) for A1 just when (1) a1 \u2208 VisA\nand (2) no a \u2208 A1 \u2229 VisA attacks a1. We assume some function NextRRelToVisA : 2\nA \u2192 2R such that NextRRelToVisA (A1) is the set of all persuasion acts possible for A1 at VisA. Meanwhile, we let execVisA : 2\nR \u2192 2A be the function that does the one-step calculation with execVisA (B) = (VisA\\{a \u2208 VisA | (ax ,a,ay ) \u2208 B})\u222a {a \u2208 A\\VisA | (ax , \u03f5,a) \u2208 B or (ax ,ay ,a) \u2208 B} which updates VisA by adding all arguments that are made visible by any persuasive act in B, and by subtracting all arguments that are made invisible by conversion in B unless they are made visible by other persuasive acts in B (i.e. unless cancellation of the effect occurs). With this, we define that (A1, (VisA,execVisA (R))) \u2208\u21aa\u2192 for all A1 \u2286 A, R \u2286 NextRRelToVisA (A1) and VisA, and we define also that \u21aa\u2192 does not include any other elements. Clearly this definition is inductive from AI.\nTo explain the motivation for the \u2018execVisA (R) for all R \u2286 NextRRelToVisA (A1)\u2019 instead of just NextRRelToVisA (A1) but also transitions in general, we consider some examples of persuasive acts as shown below.\na4\na3\na5\na4 a1\na5a2\na3\na2\na4\na1\na1 a3\na3\na4\na2 a1a1 a2 a4\nAssume that a square argument is initially visible, so that we have AI = {a1,a2,a4} in the top-left figure, AI = {a1,a2} in the topright figure, and AI = {a1,a3,a4} in the bottom figure. In case we have more than one persuasion, a change to be incurred to VisA may be synchronous or asynchronous. In the former, all persuasive acts that are currently possible are checked before any changes are effected, and all the changes occur simultaneously. If persuasion is synchronous in the top-left figure, we obtain both a5 as incurred by a4 and a3 as incurred by a1. In asynchronous active persuasion (as we saw earlier in the Alice example), not all possible persuasive acts may be simultaneously executed, although that is one possibility. It may be that a2 is persuaded by a1 into a3. Then there is nothing that a4 may persuade, and a5 remains invisible if not already visible (so under the present assumption that AI = {a1,a2,a4}, it remains invisible). It may be that a2 is persuaded by a4 into a5, instead, in which case a3 remains invisible if not already visible. Using the formal notations we introduced, we have NextRRelToVisA (A1) = {(a1,a2,a3), (a4,a2,a5)} for each A1 \u2286 {a1,a2,a3,a4,a5} when VisA is AI, as this simple example contains no attacks. Now, to reflect the concurrency aspect of persuasion acts, we need a transition for each subset of NextRRelToVisA for each reference arguments\u2019 set A1, and this explains the\u2018execVisA (R) for all\nR \u2286 NextRRelToVisA (A1)\u2019. For each A1 \u2208 {a1,a2,a3,a4,a5}, we have execVisA ({(a1,a2,a3)}) = {a1,a3,a4} (by executing the active persuasion act (a1,a2,a3), a2 becomes invisible, and a3 becomes visible), execVisA ({(a4,a2,a5)}) = {a1,a4,a5} (by executing the active persuasion act (a1,a4,a5), a4 becomes invisible and a5 becomes visible), and execVisA ({(a1,a2,a3), (a4,a2,a5)}) = {a1,a3,a4,a5} (by executing the two persuasion acts simultaneously, both a3 and a5 become visible, and a2 becomes invisible). So (A1, (AI, {a1,a3,a4})), (A1, (AI, {a1,a4,a5})), and (A1, (AI, {a1,a3,a4,a5})) for each A1 \u2286 {a1,a2,a3,a4,a5} is a member of \u21aa\u2192. No other transitions are possible after any of the three possibilities, so they are the only elements of \u21aa\u2192.\nThe top-right figure contains looping persuasion links. From AI, it may be that (a2,a1,a4) executes, and we have AI \u21aa\u2192A1 {a2,a4}, and then we have {a2,a4} \u21aa\u2192A1 {a2,a4} (fixpoint). Similarly when (a1,a2,a3) executes. Or it may be that at first AI \u21aa\u2192A1 {a3,a4}, and then {a3,a4} \u21aa\u2192A1 {a1,a3,a4}, {a3,a4} \u21aa\u2192A1 {a2,a3,a4}, or {a3,a4} \u21aa\u2192A1 {a1,a2,a3,a4}, depending on which persuasion act(s) take place. From {a1,a3,a4}, we have {a1,a3,a4} \u21aa\u2192A1 {a1,a3,a4} (if (a3, \u03f5,a1) or (a1, \u03f5,a4) or both of them take place) or {a1,a3,a4} \u21aa\u2192A1 {a1,a2,a3,a4}. Similarly for {a2,a3,a4}. From {a1,a2,a3,a4}, we have {a1,a2,a3,a4} \u21aa\u2192A1 {a1,a2,a3,a4} or {a1,a2,a3,a4} \u21aa\u2192A1 {a2,a3,a4} (if (a2,a1,a4) takes place but not (a3, \u03f5,a1)), or {a1,a2,a3,a4} \u21aa\u2192A1 {a1,a3,a4} (if (a1,a2,a3) takes place but not (a4, \u03f5,a2)). And these are all the possible transitions in the top-right figure.\nThe bottom figure contains persuasive acts and, unlike in the two previous figures, also an attack. For any A1 such that a2 < A1, we have {a1,a3,a4} \u21aa\u2192A1 {a1,a3,a5} (if conversion takes place before inducement) or {a1,a3,a4} \u21aa\u2192A1 {a1,a2,a3,a4} (if inducement takes place before conversion) or {a1,a3,a4} \u21aa\u2192A1 {a1,a2,a3,a5} (if both persuasion acts take place at the same time). From {a1,a3a5}, we have {a1,a3,a5} \u21aa\u2192A1 {a1,a2,a3,a5}. From {a1,a2,a3,a4}, we have {a1,a2,a3,a4} \u21aa\u2192A1 {a1,a2,a3,a4} (if conversion does not take place) or {a1,a2,a3,a4} \u21aa\u2192A1 {a1,a2,a3,a5}. However, for any A2 such that a2 \u2208 A2, the conversion will not take place when a2 \u2208 VisA. While, if VisA does not contain a2, the transitions from VisA are the same as before, from {a1,a2,a3,a4}, we do not have {a1,a2,a3,a4} \u21aa\u2192A2 {a1,a2,a3,a5}."}, {"heading": "3.1 Admissibilities", "text": "Now, what distinct properties are there for an admissible arguments set in APA frameworks? Just as conflict-freeness and defendedness in Dung\u2019s frameworks, reasonable criteria may be set forth. Conflict-freeness We say that A1 \u2286 A is currently conflict-free iff no visible element of A1 attacks a visible element of A1 at VisA. Mutation-freeness We say that A1 \u2286 A is currently mutation-free iff no visible element of A1 converts a visible element of A1 at VisA. Defendedness We say that A1 \u2286 A is currently defended iff for each (a2,a1,\u03b1) \u2208 R for a2 \u2208 VisA\\A1, a1 \u2208 VisA \u2229A1 and \u03b1 \u2208 {\u03f5} \u222aA, there exists some ax \u2208 VisA \u2229A1 such that (ax ,a2, \u03f5) \u2208 R. Properness We say that A1 \u2286 A is currently proper iff A1 \u2286 VisA.\nMutation-freeness is a natural variation of conflict-freeness for internal conversions, and defendedness is a natural extension of Dung\u2019s defendedness with conversions. Properness ensures that we will not\nbe talking of invisible arguments. The major difference from Dung\u2019s properties is that, because of transitions of currently visible arguments, all these properties are dependent on VisA. We naturally find characterisation of \u2018current\u2019 admissibility with these notions:A1 \u2286 A is currently admissible iff A1 is currently conflict-free, mutation-free, defended and proper.\nFor general admissibilities, one way of describing more varieties is to embed this admissibility and transitions into computation tree logic (CTL) or other branching-time logic, by which model-theoretical results known to the logic become available to APA frameworks, too. Let the grammar of \u03d5 be:\n\u03d5 := \u22a5 | > | P\u03b4 (Ax ) | \u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2227 \u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2228 \u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2283 \u03d5 | AX\u03d5 | EX\u03d5 | AF\u03d5 | EF\u03d5 | AG\u03d5 | EG\u03d5\nwhere P\u03b4 (Ax ) is the atomic expression that some set of arguments Ax is currently admissible in an argumentation framework \u03b4 := (AI,A,R, \u21aa\u2192). We did not include Until operators for certain semantic awkwardness, as to be mentioned later. We denote the class of all atomic predicates for \u03b4 by P\u03b4 . For semantics, let S be the class of all sequences of the elements of X:{s\u2200N , s \u2203 N , s \u2200 F , s \u2203 F , s \u2200 G , s \u2203 G }. We refer to an element of S by \u0393. \u0393 may be empty. Let L : 2A \u2192 2P\u03b4 be a labelling function such that L(Ax ) = {P\u03b4 (Ay ) \u2208 P\u03b4 | Ay is currently admissible when VisA is Ax }. We define a head and a tail operator h : S \u2192 X, t : S \u2192 S , such that for any non-empty \u0393, we have h(\u0393).t(\u0393) = \u0393. Here \u2018.\u2019 is a sequence concatenator.

If one is so inclined, he/she may choose to consider that components of \u03b4 that appear in M are semantic counterparts of those that appear in the syntax of CTL with one-to-one correspondence between them.\n\u2022 M,A1, \u0393 |= AF\u03d5 iffM,A1, s\u2200F .\u0393 |= \u03d5. \u2022 M,A1, \u0393 |= EF\u03d5 iffM,A1, s\u2203F .\u0393 |= \u03d5. \u2022 M,A1, \u0393 |= AG\u03d5 iffM,A1, s\u2200G .\u0393 |= \u03d5. \u2022 M,A1, \u0393 |= EG\u03d5 iffM,A1, s\u2203G .\u0393 |= \u03d5. We say that \u03d5 is true in \u03b4 iff M,AI, (empty) |= \u03d5. It is straightforward to see the following well-known equivalences of CTL in our semantics. \u00acAF\u03d5 \u2261 EG\u00ac\u03d5, \u00acEF\u03d5 \u2261 AG\u00ac\u03d5, \u00acAX\u03d5 \u2261 EG\u00ac\u03d5 (De Morgan\u2019s Laws), AG\u03d5 \u2261 \u03d5 \u2227 AXAG\u03d5, EG\u03d5 \u2261 \u03d5 \u2227 EXEG\u03d5, AF\u03d5 \u2261 \u03d5 \u2228 AXAF\u03d5, EF\u03d5 \u2261 \u03d5 \u2228 EXEF\u03d5 (Expansion Laws) by induction on the size (the number of symbols) of \u03d5.\nAs readers notice, we are dealing with all state transitions only at entailments of an atomic expression. This is because semantic interpretation of an expression of the kind EX(P\u03b4 (A1) \u2227 P\u03b4 (A2)) with a temporal operator over more than two atomic predicates are possibly taking a distinct arguments set. In words, this expression says: there exists a transition such that after the transition, P\u03b4 (A1) and P\u03b4 (A2) are both true in the next state. However, the meaning of the \u2018next state\u2019 actually depends on the parameter to P\u03b4 , as a transition by a persuasive act is relativised to a reference arguments set. As such, until the recursive entailment reaches an atomic expression, we cannot really pinpoint which states the next states are. The consequence is that EX,EF,EG distribute over inner expressions, e.g. EX(\u03d51 \u2227 \u03d52) and EX\u03d51 \u2227 EX\u03d52 have the same semantic meaning. The reason we dropped Until operators is due to this semantic interpretation that it does not reflect an ordinary expectation out of the operations. Of course, when it is known that all atomic predicates accept the same arguments set, a more standard interpretation may be given, and the Until operators will behave as anticipated. We shall discuss these semantic interpretations in a greater detail in a future work.\nThere are some notable admissibility types we can take out of the CTL sub-logic.\n(1) EXP\u03b4 (Ax ) and EFP\u03b4 (Ax ). An example situation where these properties are useful: a sales person X can attempt persuasion of his/her unwilling customer A just once (EXP\u03b4 (Ax )) or as many as he/she likes (EFP\u03b4 (Ax )) before A delivers a final decision. Is it possible to influence A\u2019s decision to include Ax , favourable decisions to X? The duals of these expressions deal with negative statements. Enforcement [9] is somehow related to a particular instance of these kinds of queries. (2) AGP\u03b4 (Ax ): An example: a patient is under treatment for one morbidity based on a clinical guideline. His/her clinician sees a need of prescribing more actions to him/her for another morbidity he/she sustains. Is it possible that those actions (described with the persuasion operators) will keep the currently attained desirable effects of the treatment (Ax ) intact? The dual of this expression deals with negative statements.\nAdaptation of Dung\u2019s complete, preferred, stable and grounded semantics should also diversify our admissibilities. It must be noted, however, that the presence of our relativised dynamic transitions do not permit step-wise construction of a preferred set from the grounded set as meaningfully as in Dung\u2019s."}, {"heading": "3.2 Conclusion with related work", "text": "We have shown a new research direction for abstract argumentation with dynamic operators of persuasive acts on Dung\u2019s frameworks.\nWe set forth important properties and notions, and showed embedding of \u2018current admissibility\u2019 into CTL for various admissibilities. Many technical developments are expected to follow. Our contribution is promising for bringing together knowledge of abstract argumentation in AI and techniques and issues of concurrency in program analysis in a very near future. Cross-studies in the two domains is highly expected. Studying concurrent aspects of argumentation are in fact important for evaluation of opinion transitions, which influences development of more effective sales approaches and better marketing in business, and consensus control tactics in politics. Harnessing our study with probabilistic methods are likely to form exciting research. Our present plan is to take into account nuances of persuasive acts like pseudo-logic, scapegoating, threat, and half-truths in addition to the future work we mentioned earlier.\nFor dynamic aspects, [6, 11, 12, 14, 15, 26] calculate a modified argumentation framework (post-state) from an original argumentation framework (pre-state) given some input. In spirit, they are similar to the AGM belief revision [1]. Coordination of dynamics and statics, on the other hand, is still under-investigated. A kind was studied in [3] for coalition profitability and formability semantics. More closely, propositional dynamic logic [16] was used to represent abstract argumentation so that in the language addition and removal of arguments and attacks may be expressed. In an extended work, we will detail comparisons with their work.\nArgumentation theories that accommodate aspects of persuasion have been noted across several papers. In [7], argumentation frameworks were augmented with values that controlled defeat judgement. Unlike their work, our persuasion acts are stand-alone relations which may be \u2018executed\u2019 non-deterministically and concurrently, may irreversibly modify visible arguments, and may produce loops. In most of argumentation papers on this topic, persuasion or negotiation is treated in a dialogue game [2, 8, 10, 18\u201320, 22\u201325]. While we do not assume any dialogue here, our admissibilities should provide means of describing many types of argumentation queries. Studies on temporal arguments include [4, 5, 21]. These actually consider arguments that may be time-dependent. APA frameworks keep arguments abstract, but observe temporal progress through actual execution of persuasive acts. Our use of temporal logic is for describing admissibilities rather than arguments (recall that P\u03b4 (Ax ) is a formula on admissibility and not an argument). The idea of visible and invisible arguments is similar to usable and unusable arguments in [5]. However, while their usable/unusable judgement is coupled directly with defendedness of arguments, our visibility changes are in accordance to executions of persuasive acts."}], "references": [{"title": "On the Logic of Theory Change: Partial Meet Contraction and Revision Functions", "author": ["Carlos E.
