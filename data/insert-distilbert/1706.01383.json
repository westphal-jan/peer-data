Specifically, those arms are characterized by their distributions \u03bd1, . . . , \u03bdd and pulling arm i \u2208 [d] := {1, ..., d} at time t yields a reward Xi(t) \u223c \u03bdi, the sequence (Xi(t))t>1 being assumed to be i.i.d. There are many motivations behind the study of those models, ranging from random clinical trials, to maximization of the click through rate, portfolio optimization, etc.\nAn algorithm (or policy) maps anterior observations to the next arm I(t) \u2208 [d] to be pulled. The performance of a given algorithm is evaluated by its cumulative regret Reg(T ) defined as the difference between the rewards gathered by the sequence (I(t))16t6T and those that might have been obtained in expectation by always behaving optimally, that is, by pulling the arm with maximal mean \u00b5i := E\u03bdi [X] at each round:\nReg(T ) = T\u00b5\u2217 \u2212 T\u2211 t=1 XI(t)(t) where \u00b5\u2217 = max i\u2208[d] \u00b5i .\nThe classical multi-armed bandit problem is now well understood, and there exist algorithms minimizing the regret such that\nE [Reg(T )] . \u2211 i\u2208[d] \u2206i>0 log(T ) \u2206i , where \u2206i = \u00b5\u2217 \u2212 \u00b5i ,\nand where the notation . indicates that the inequality holds up to some universal multiplicative constants and some additive constants1. Converse statements have also been proved, first by Lai and Robbins (1985) and then by Burnetas and Katehakis (1996): Any consistent policy (i.e. whose regret is always less than T\u03b1 for all \u03b1 > 0) always have a regret larger than \u2211d i=1 log(T ) \u2206i\n(again, up to some constants). When T is fixed and the parameters \u00b5i are chosen to maximize regret, the\ndistribution-independent bounds are of order \u221a dT as first shown in Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi (2006).\nThe main drawback of those results is that the regret scales linearly with the number of arms d,or with \u221a d in the minimax analysis. Since upper and lower bounds match, this is actually ineluctable. On the other hand, we aim at leveraging 1We focus, for the sake of clarity, on the leading terms in T with explicit dependencies in the different parameters of the problems.\nan additional assumption to reduce that (linear) dependency in d and even get rid of it, if possible. We therefore define and investigate the sparse bandit problem (SPB) where the decision maker knows a priori that only s of the d arms have a significant mean \u00b5i.\nSpecifically, we assume that exactly s arms have positive means2. Without loss of generality, we number the arms in nonincreasing order and write\n\u00b5\u2217 = \u00b51 > \u00b52 > \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 > \u00b5s > 0 > \u00b5s+1 > \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 > \u00b5d.\nA key quantity will be the lowest positive mean \u00b5s: if \u00b5s is arbitrarily close to 0, then the sparsity assumption is useless. On the other side of the spectrum, if \u00b5s 0, then the sparsity assumption will turn out to be helpful.\nInformally, we aim at replacing the dependency in the total number of arms d with the same dependency in the number s of arms with positive means. In other words, we wish to achieve an upper bound of the following kind\nE [Reg(T )] . \u2211 i\u2208[s] \u2206i>0 log(T ) \u2206i ,\nwhenever this is possible. Notice that the above is precisely the optimal regret bound if the agent knew in advance which are s arms with positive means. In the worst case, this gives a distribution independent upper bound of the order of \u221a sT\ninstead of the classical \u221a dT (up to logarithmic terms).\nThe Sparse Bandit problem is therefore a variation of the classical stochastic multi-armed bandit problem (see Bubeck and Cesa-Bianchi (2012) for a survey) in which the agent knows the number of arms with positive means.\nThere have been some works regarding sparsity assumptions in bandit problems. In the full information setting, some of them focus on sparse reward vectors, i.e., at most s components of (X1(t), . . . , Xd(t)) are positive (see for instance Langford et al. (2009); Kwon and Perchet (2016)). Another considered problem is the one of sparse linear bandits Carpentier et al. (2012); Abbasi-Yadkori et al. (2012); Gerchinovitz (2013); Lattimore et al. (2015) in which the underlying unknown vector of parameter is assumed to be sparse \u2013 that is with a constraint on its L1 norm \u2013 or even spiky in the crude and very specific case where s = 1 Bubeck et al. (2013). However, none of the previously cited work tackles the following concrete problem. Assume that you are planning a marketing campaign for wich you have thousands of possible products to display. Most probably, many of them\n2Equivalently, we could be given a threshold \u03c4 and the exact number s of arms with means strictly greater than \u03c4 .\nwill be similar and have similar, very low expected returns but you do not have any possibility to know that in advance. In many common datasets such as Yandex\u2019s one 3, depending on the query it is usual to have only 50 items out of 1500 that can be considered as relevant. Consequently, in order to avoid exploring thoses bad items, you want to be able to set rules to eliminate them as quickly as possible and get a regret that scales in the number of good arms."}, {"heading": "1.1 Contributions", "text": "We introduce and investigate the sparse bandits problem by deriving an asymptotic lower bound on the regret.

And this is indeed the case without further assumption to leverage.\nAssumption 1. s arms have positive means (i.e., \u00b5i > 0), while the other d \u2212 s arms have nonpositive means (i.e., \u00b5i\u2032 6 0).\nAn arm with positive (resp. nonpositive) mean will also be refered to as good (resp. bad).

To avoid too heavy expressions, the lower bound we establish holds for problems where the bad arms have a null expected reward, though handling general negative means does not require huge modifications from the given proof. Our goal is to provide a result that is easily generalizable to any stochastic bandit problem containing a sparsity information in the form of a threshold on the values of the expected return of the arms of interest. A generalization of the presented bound can be found in Appendix B.\nDefinition 1. An algorithm is uniformly efficient if for any sparse bandit problem and all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1], its expected regret satisfies E [Reg(T )] = o(T\u03b1).\nWe state the bound for Gaussian bandit models with a fixed variance equal to 1/4. In that case, a distribution is simply characterized by its mean \u00b5 and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between two models \u00b5 and \u00b5\u2032 is equal to 2(\u00b5\u2212 \u00b5\u2032)2.

Then, for any uniformly efficient algorithm, played against arms whose distributions are Gaussian with variance 1/4 and with respective means \u00b51, . . . , \u00b5d, one of the following asymptotic lower bounds hold.\n\u2022 If d\u2212s\u00b51 \u2212 \u2211\ni\u2208[s] \u2206i>0\n\u2206i \u00b52i > 0,\nlim inf T\u2192\u221e\nReg(T ) log(T ) > \u2211 i\u2208[s] \u2206i>0 max { 1 2\u2206i , \u2206i 2\u00b52i } (1)\n\u2022 otherwise, there exist k 6 s such that d\u2212s\u00b51 \u2212 \u2211s i=k \u2206i \u00b52i\n< 0, and the lower bound is\nlim inf T\u2192\u221e\nReg(T ) log(T ) > \u2211 i\u2208[k] \u2206i>0 1 2\u2206i + s\u2211 i=k+1 \u00b52k \u00b52i \u2206i 2\u22062k + (d\u2212 s) 2\u00b51 ( 1\u2212 \u00b5 2 k \u22062k ) . (2)\nRemarks. Since the decision maker has more knowledge on the parameters of the problem than in the classical multi-armed bandit problem, we expect the lower bound to be less than the traditional one (without the sparsity assumption), which is\nlim inf T\u2192\u221e\nReg(T ) log(T ) > \u2211 i\u2208[d] \u2206i>0 1 2\u2206i .\nIndeed, since the max is smaller than the sum, in the first case, we have\u2211 i\u2208[s] \u2206i>0 max { 1 2\u2206i , \u2206i 2\u00b52i } 6 \u2211 i\u2208[s] \u2206i>0 1 2\u2206i + \u2211 i\u2208[s] \u2206i>0 \u2206i 2\u00b52i 6 \u2211 i\u2208[s] \u2206i>0 1 2\u2206i + d\u2212 s \u00b51 = \u2211 i\u2208[d] \u2206i>0 1 2\u2206i .\nSimilarly, in the second case, we get that k\u2211 i=1 1 2\u2206i + s\u2211 i=k+1 \u00b52k \u00b52i \u2206i 2\u22062k + (d\u2212 s) 2\u00b51 ( 1\u2212 \u00b5 2 k \u22062k ) = \u2211 i\u2208[d] \u2206i>0 1 2\u2206i \u2212 \u00b5 2 k \u22062k ( d\u2212 s 2\u00b51 \u2212 s\u2211 i=k+1 \u2206i 2\u00b52i\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n>0\n) \u2212 s\u2211 i=k+1 1 2\u2206i .\nMoreover, if \u2206s \u00b52s > d\u2212s\u00b51 , then both lower bounds match. Stated otherwise, the sparsity assumption is irrelevant as soon as\n\u00b5s 6 \u00b51 \u22121 +\n\u221a 1 + 4(d\u2212 s)\n2(d\u2212 s) ' \u00b51\u221a d\u2212 s .\nProof. The proof relies on changes of measure arguments originating from Graves and Lai (1997). First, consider the set of changes of distributions that modify the best arm without changing the marginal of the best arm in the original sparse bandit problem:\nB(\u00b5) = { \u00b5\u2032 \u2208 S(d, s) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u00b5\u20321 = \u00b51 and maxi\u2208[d] \u00b5i < maxi\u2208[d] \u00b5\u2032i } .\nConcretely, if one considers an alternative sparse bandit model \u00b5\u2032 such that one of the originally null arms becomes the new best arm, then one of the originally non-null arms in \u00b5 must be taken to zero in \u00b5\u2032 in order to keep the sparse structure of the problem.\nIn general, the equivalent of Th. 17 in (Kaufmann et al., 2015) or Proposition 3 in (Lagr\u00e9e et al., 2016) can be stated in our case as follows: For all changes of measure \u00b5\u2032 \u2208 B(\u00b5),\nlim inf T\u2192\u221e\n\u2211d i=1 2E[Ni(T + 1)](\u00b5i \u2212 \u00b5\u2032i)2\nlog(T ) > 1. (3)\nDetails on this type of informational lower bounds can be found in Garivier et al. (2017.To appear.) and references therein. Now, following general ideas from Graves and Lai (1997) and lower bound techniques from Lagr\u00e9e et al. (2016) and Combes et al. (2015), we may give a variational form of the lower bound on the regret satisfying the above constraint.\nlim inf T\u2192\u221e\nReg(T )\nlog(T ) > inf c\u2208C \u2211 i\u2208[d] ci\u2206i, (4)\nwhere the set C corresponds to constraints that are directly implied by Eq.(3) above:\nC = (ci)i\u2208[d] \u2208 Rd+ \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2200\u00b5\u2032 \u2208 B(\u00b5), 2 \u2211 i\u2208[d] ci(\u00b5i \u2212 \u00b5\u2032i)2 > 1  . We aim at obtaining a lower bound of the infimum from Eq.(4). In this constrained optimization problem, the constraints set is huge because every change of measure \u00b5\u2032 \u2208 B(\u00b5) must satisfy (3). On the other side, relaxing some constraints \u2013 or considering only a subset of B(\u00b5)\u2013 simply allows to reach even lower values 4.\nWe consider C\u0303 defined as C\u0303 = {\n(ci)i\u2208[d] \u2208 Rd+ \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 for all i \u2208 [s] \\ {1} and j \u2208 [d] \\ [s], ci\u2206 2 i > 1/2\ncj\u00b5 2 1 + ci\u00b5 2 i > 1/2\n}\nand we prove that C is a subset of C\u0303, namely that there are more acceptable vectors of coefficients in C allowing us to reach lower values of the argument.\n4At that point, we may lose the optimality of the finally obtained lower bound but this is a price we accept to pay in order to obtain a computable solution.\nLet (ci)i\u2208[d] \u2208 C and let us prove that it belongs to C\u0303. Let i \u2208 [s] \\ {1}, \u03b3 > 0 and consider \u00b5(i,\u03b3) \u2208 Rd defined as the following modification of \u00b5:\n\u00b5 (i,\u03b3) k = { \u00b51 + \u03b3 if k = i \u00b5k otherwise, k \u2208 [d].\nWe easily see that \u00b5(i,\u03b3) belongs to B(\u00b5). Therefore, by definition of C, (ci)i\u2208[d] satisfies: \u2211\nk\u2208[d]\nck(\u00b5k \u2212 \u00b5(i,\u03b3)k )2 > 1\n2 ,\nwhich, by definition of \u00b5(i,\u03b3) boils down to ci(\u2206i + \u03b3)2 > 1/2. This being true for all \u03b3 > 0, we have ci\u22062i > 1/2. The first condition in the defintion of C\u0303 is then satisfied.\nSimilary, for i \u2208 [s] \\ {1}, j \u2208 [d] \\ [s] and \u03b3 > 0 we consider \u00b5(i,j,\u03b3) \u2208 Rd defined by:\n\u00b5 (i,j,\u03b3) k =  0 if k = i \u00b51 + \u03b3 if k = j \u00b5k otherwise, k \u2208 [d].\n\u00b5(i,j,\u03b3) also belongs to B(\u00b5). By definition of C, (ci)i\u2208[d] satisfies:\u2211 k\u2208[d] ck(\u00b5k \u2212 \u00b5(i,j,\u03b3)k )2 > 1 2 ,\nwhich boils down to ci\u00b52i + cj\u2206 2 j > 1/2 (after taking the infinimum over \u03b3 > 0). Since \u2206j = \u00b51, the second condition in the definition of C\u0303 is satisfied. We have proved that (ci)i\u2208[d] belongs to C\u0303 and consequently that C is a subset of C\u0303. Therefore,\nlim inf T\u2192+\u221e\nReg(T )\nlog(T ) > inf c\u2208C \u2211 i\u2208[d] ci\u2206i > inf c\u2208C\u0303 \u2211 i\u2208[d] ci\u2206i.\nThe computation of the optimization problem over C\u0303 is deferred to Appendix A.\nRemark 1. This is a linear optimization problem under inequality constraints so there exist algorithmic methods such as the celebrated Simplex algorithm Dantzig (2016) to compute a numeric solution of it. Nonetheless, in our case, it is possible to give an explicit solution."}, {"heading": "4 Sparse UCB", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.1 The SPARSEUCB algorithm", "text": "The SPARSEUCB algorithm is formally defined in Algorithm 1 but let us first provide an informal description. The algorithm can be in different phases (denoted r, f and u), depending on past observations, and its behavior radically changes from one phase to another.

We now describe the different phases.\nRound-robin The algorithm starts with a round-robin phase, which corresponds to \u03c9(t) = r. Each of the d arms is pulled once successively.\nThen, for each time t > d+ 1, the following sets are defined:\nJ (t) := { i \u2208 [d] \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Xi(Ni(t)) > 2 \u221a log(Ni(t))\nNi(t)\n} ,\nK(t) := { i \u2208 [d] \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Xi(Ni(t)) > 2 \u221a log(t)\nNi(t)\n} .\nWe will refer to the arms in J (t) as the active arms and those in K(t) as active and sufficiently sampled.\nIf there are less than s active arms, i.e., |J (t)| < s, the algorithm enters a round-robin phase, and pulls each arm successively. This implies that \u03c9(t) = r for the next d stages.\nForce-log If there are at least s active arms, but less than s sufficiently sampled arms (|K(t)| < s), the algorithm enters a force-log phase (\u03c9(t) = f). In this phase, the algorithm pulls any arm in the set J (t) \\ K(t).\nUCB If the set K(t) contains at least s arms, the algorithm enters a UCB phase (\u03c9(t) = u). The algorithm selects an arm in K(t) according to the UCB rule, i.e. it chooses the arm i \u2208 K(t) which maximizes the quantity:\nXi(Ni(t)) + 2\n\u221a log(t)\nNi(t) .\nThe pseudo-code of the whole procedure is given in Algorithm 1 and the skeleton\nin Figure 2.\nInput: the total number of arms d and the number of arms with positive means s Initialization: t\u2190 1\nfor k = 1 . . . d do /* round-robin */ I(t)\u2190 k ; \u03c9(t)\u2190 r ; t\u2190 t+ 1 ; end while t 6 T do\nCompute J (t)\u2190 { i \u2208 [d] \u2223\u2223\u2223Xi(Ni(t)) > 2\u221a log(Ni(t))Ni(t) } Compute K(t)\u2190 { i \u2208 [d]\n\u2223\u2223\u2223Xi(Ni(t)) > 2\u221a log(t)Ni(t)} if |J (t)| < s then\nfor k = 1 . . . d do /* round-robin */ I(t)\u2190 k ; \u03c9(t)\u2190 r ; t\u2190 t+ 1 ;\nend else if |K(t)| < s then /* force-log */\nI(t) \u2208 J (t) \\ K(t) ; \u03c9(t)\u2190 f ; t\u2190 t+ 1 ;\nelse /* UCB */ I(t) \u2208 arg maxi\u2208K(t) { Xi(Ni(t)) + 2 \u221a log(t) Ni(t) } ; \u03c9(t)\u2190 u ; t\u2190 t+ 1 ;\nend end\nAlgorithm 1: SPARSEUCB The broad idea is that the algorithm should quickly identify the s good arms, and then pull those arms according to an UCB rule (or, alternatively, any other\npolicy). At the end, only those s good arms would be pulled an infinite number of times.\nThe set J (t) of active arms is defined in such a way that the expected number of pulls needed for a good arm to become active is finite. Therefore, only a finite number (in expectation) of round-robin phases is needed for all s good arms to become active (see Lemma 7).\nReciprocally, a bad arm (with non-positive mean) is only pulled while active, that is a finite number of times in expectation. The main issue occurs when a bad arm happens to be active. In that case, the delay between two successive pulls of an active null arm typically increases exponentially fast because the regret scales with log(t). Consequently, it would take an exponential number of stages for this arm to become inactive again. And this could be dramatic for the regret if the best arm was, at the same time, inactive, as the regret would increase by a fixed constant of at least \u22062 on all those stages. The purpose of the force-log phases is to make sure that each active arm gets pulled sufficiently often so that the expected number of steps a bad arm remains active is finite. If the best arm happened to be inactive, then the number of active arms would drop below s, and performing a round-robin phase would allow it to quickly become active again.\nTheorem 2. The SPARSEUCB algorithm guarantees\nE [Reg(T )] . log(T ) \u2211 i\u2208[s] \u2206i>0 ( 1 \u2206i + \u2206i \u00b52i ) ,\nwhere notation . removes universal multiplicative constants and additive datadependant constants.

For t > d+ 1, we introduce Ai(t) := {I(t) = i, i \u2208 J (t)}, which is the event of arm i being pulled at time t while active, so that\n{I(t) = i} = Ri(t) tAi(t), t > 1,\nsee, e.g. Property (v) from Lemma 6.\nUsing the above decompositions, we can write the regret as:\nE [Reg(T )] = \u2211 i\u2208[d] \u2206i>0 \u2206iE [ T\u2211 t=1 1 {Ri(t)} ] + \u2211 i\u2208[s] \u2206i>0 \u2206iE [ T\u2211 t=1 1 {Fi(t)} ] + \u2211 i\u2208[s] \u2206i>0 \u2206iE [ T\u2211 t=1 1 {Ui(t)} ]\n+ \u2211 i\u2208[s] \u2206i>0 \u2206iE [ T\u2211 t=1 1 {Vi(t)} ] + d\u2211 i=s+1 \u2206iE [ T\u2211 t=1 1 {Ai(t)} ] .\nWe upper-bound independently the five above quantities. For the sake of clarity, we only provide here the main ideas of proof. A detailed analysis can be found in Appendix C.\nLemma 1. The regret induced the round-robin phases is controlled by:\nE [ +\u221e\u2211 t=1 1 {Ri(t)} ] 6 1 + 3s+ 8 s\u2211 j=1 1 \u00b52j ( 1 + 4 log ( 16 \u00b52j )) , i \u2208 [d].\nMain argument of proof. The algorithm performs a round-robin phase only if less than s arms are active, thus necessarily when one of the good arms j \u2208 [s] is not active. This implies that Xj(Nj(t)) < 2 \u221a log(Nj(t)) Nj(t)\n. The probability of this happening decreases exponentially fast and as a consequence, the expected number of round-robin phases is bounded. 2\nLemma 2. The regret induced by a good arm i \u2208 [s] during force-log phases is controlled by:\nE [ T\u2211 t=1 1 {Fi(t)} ] 6 16 log(T ) + 8 \u00b52i .\nMain argument of proof. Arm i \u2208 [s] is pulled during a force-log phase if its empirical mean is below 2 \u221a log(t) Ni(t)\n. Because arm i has a positive mean, the probability of this happening turns out to decrease exponentially, as soon as Ni(t) >\n16 log(T ) \u00b52i . Therefore, the expected number of times arm i is pulled during\na force-log phase is bounded by 16 log(T ) \u00b52i plus a constant term. 2\nLemma 3. The regret induced by a good arm i \u2208 [s] during UCB phases, while 1 \u2208 K(t), is controlled by\nE [ T\u2211 t=1 1 {Ui(t)} ] 6 16 log(T ) + 8 \u22062i + 3.\nMain argument of proof. The proof basically follows the steps of the classic UCB analysis by Auer et al. (2002). 2\nLemma 4. The regret induced by good arms during UCB phases, while 1 6\u2208 K(t), is controlled by: \u2211\ni\u2208[s]\n\u2206iE [ T\u2211 t=1 1 {Vi(t)} ] 6 d\u2206s\u03c0 2 6 .\nMain argument of proof. The algorithm performs a UCB phase if the setK(t) has at least s arms. If it does not contain the best arm 1, it must necessarily contain an arm j \u2208 {s+ 1, . . . , d}, i.e. with nonpositive mean. As a consequence, the\nempirical mean of arm j is above 2 \u221a\nlog(t) Nj(t) . Because arm j has a nonpositive mean,\nthe probability of this happening turns out to decrease as t\u22121/2. Consequently, the expected number of times a good arm is pulled during a UCB phase while the best arm does not belong to K(t) is finite. 2\nLemma 5. The regret induced by a bad arm i \u2208 {s+ 1, . . . , d} while active is controlled by:\nE [ +\u221e\u2211 t=1 1 {Ai(t)} ] 6 \u03c02 6 .\nMain argument of proof. Arm i is active if its empirical mean is above 2 \u221a\nlog(Ni(t)) Ni(t) . Because its mean is nonpositive, this happens with a total probability of the order of \u2211 t\u22122. Therefore, the regret incurred when i is active is bounded. 2\nIt only remains to combine the above results, to upper bound the expected regret as\nE [Reg(T )] . log(T ) \u2211 i\u2208[s] \u2206i>0 ( 1 \u2206i + \u2206i \u00b52i ) + d s\u2211 j=1 \u00b51 log(1/\u00b5 2 j ) \u00b52j ,\nwhere we omitted multiplicative universal constants. We emphasize the fact that the last term is independent of T , hence the dominating term is\nE [Reg(T )] . log(T ) \u2211 i\u2208[s] \u2206i>0 max { 1 \u2206i , \u2206i \u00b52i } ."}, {"heading": "5 Optimality, ranges of sparsity and constants optimization", "text": "We prove in this section that the algorithm SPARSEUCB is optimal, up to multiplicative factor, for a wide range of parameters.

In that case,\nthe lower bound of Theorem 1 rewrites as\nlim inf T\u2192\u221e\nReg(T ) log(T ) & \u2211 i\u2208[s] \u2206i>0 max { 1 \u2206i , \u2206i \u00b52i }\nwhile SPARSEUCB suffers an expected regret bounded as\nReg(T ) log(T ) . \u2211 i\u2208[s] \u2206i>0 1 \u2206i + \u2206i \u00b52i . \u2211 i\u2208[s] \u2206i>0 max { 1 \u2206i , \u2206i \u00b52i } .\nObviously, SPARSEUCB is optimal for all those values of parameters. More importantly, its regret scales linearly with s and is independent of the number of arms with non-positive means.\nThe minimax regret of SPARSEUCB is necessarily of the same order of UCB, as they achieve the same regret when d\u2212s\u00b51 \u2212 \u2211 i\u2208[s] \u2206i>0 \u2206i \u00b52i is arbitrarily close to 0. So we consider instead the minimax regret with respect to the distributions with a relative sparsity level bounded away from 0, i.e., such that for some \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1), \u00b5s > \u03b8\u00b51. In particular, this yields that d\u2212ss > 1\u2212\u03b8 \u03b82\nso that the strong sparsity assumption is satisfied.\nThen, for this class of parameters, it is quite straightforward to get that the minimax regret of UCB scales as \u221a dT log(T ) \u221a 1 + \u03b81\u2212\u03b8 s d while the minimax re-\ngret of SPARSEUCB increases as \u221a sT log(T ) \u221a (1\u2212\u03b8)2 \u03b82\n+ 1.

In other words, Fi(t), Ui(t) and Vi(t) are subsets of Ai(t).\n(vi) For all t > d + 1, if an arm is pulled at time t during an UCB phase while the best arm does not belong to the set K(t), necessarily, a bad arm j \u2208 {s+ 1, . . . , d} belongs to K(t).

For i \u2208 [d], the number of times arm i is pulled, while the algorithm is performing a round-robin phase, is bounded in expectation as:\nE [ +\u221e\u2211 t=1 1 {Ri(t)} ] 6 1 + 3s+ s\u2211 j=1 1 \u00b52j ( 8 + 32 log ( 16 \u00b52j )) .\nProof. By definition of the algorithm, arm i is pulled exactly once during the first d stages:\nd\u2211 t=1 1 {Ri(t)} = 1.\nLet t > d + 1.

Indeed, let t < t\u2032 such that I(t) = I(t\u2032) = i and \u03c9(t) = \u03c9(t\u2032) = r. As a consequence of property (iii) from Lemma 6, we have\n(i) I(t\u2212 i+ k) 6= 1 for k \u2208 {2, . . . , d};\n(ii) I(t\u2032 \u2212 i+ 1) = 1.\n(iii) I(t\u2212 i+ j) = j;\nThe above properties (i) and (ii) imply t \u2212 i + d 6 t\u2032 \u2212 i, which in turn, together with property (iii), gives that arm j is pulled at least once between time t \u2212 i + 1 and t\u2032\u2212 i (at time t\u2212 i+ j). Therefore, Nj(t\u2212 i+ 1) < Nj(t\u2032\u2212 i+ 1). Therefore, the last sum in Equation (16) can be bounded, with a change of variable, as\n\u2211 d<t<+\u221e I(t)=i \u03c9(t)=r 1\n{ Xj(Nj(t\u2212 i+ 1)) < 2 \u221a log(Nj(t\u2212 i+ 1)) Nj(t\u2212 i+ 1) } 6 +\u221e\u2211 u=1 1 { Xj(u) < 2 \u221a log(u) u } .\nGoing back to Equation (16), we can now bound the expectation of the number of times arm i was pulled after time d as follows:\nE [ +\u221e\u2211 t=d+1 1 {Ri(t)} ] 6 s\u2211 j=1 +\u221e\u2211 u=1 P [ Xj(u) < 2 \u221a log(u) u ]\n6 s\u2211 j=1 +\u221e\u2211 u=1 P\n[ Xj(u)\u2212 \u00b5j < 2 \u221a log(u)\nu \u2212 \u00b5j\n] .\nOne can easily check that\nu > 3 + 32\n\u00b52j log\n( 16\n\u00b52j\n) implies 2 \u221a log(u)\nu \u2212 \u00b5j 6 \u2212 \u00b5j 2 .\nTherefore, we set uj := 3 + d(32/\u00b52j ) log(16/\u00b52j )e and write:\nE [ +\u221e\u2211 t=d+1 1 {Ri(t)} ] 6 s\u2211 j=1 +\u221e\u2211 u=1 P [ Xj(u)\u2212 \u00b5j < 2 \u221a log(u) u \u2212 \u00b5j ]\n6 s\u2211 j=1 3 + 32 \u00b52j log ( 16 \u00b52j ) + +\u221e\u2211 u=uj P [ Xj(u)\u2212 \u00b5j < \u2212 \u00b5j 2 ] 6\ns\u2211 j=1 3 + 32 \u00b52j log ( 16 \u00b52j ) + +\u221e\u2211 u=uj e\u2212u\u00b5 2 j/8  6 3s+\ns\u2211 j=1 1 \u00b52j\n( 8 + 32 log ( 16\n\u00b52j\n)) .\nLemma 8.

Let i \u2208 [s] and T > d + 1. By definition of the algorithm, 1 {Fi(t)} = 0\nfor t 6 d. Using property (iv) from Lemma 6, we write\nT\u2211 t=d+1 1 {Fi(t)} 6 T\u2211 t=d+1 1\n{ Xi(Ni(t)) < 2 \u221a log(t)\nNi(t) , I(t) = i\n}\n6 \u2211\nd+16t<+\u221e I(t)=i\n1 { Xi(Ni(t)) < 2 \u221a log(T )\nNi(t)\n} .\nThe quantity Ni(t) being increasing in the above sum, with a change of variable, we write:\nT\u2211 t=d+1 1 {Fi(t)} 6 +\u221e\u2211 u=1 1\n{ Xi(u) < 2 \u221a log(T )\nu\n} .\nWe now take the expectation:\nE\n[ T\u2211\nt=d+1\n1 {Fi(t)} ] 6\n+\u221e\u2211 u=1 P\n[ Xi(u) < 2 \u221a log(T )\nu\n] =\n+\u221e\u2211 u=1 P\n[ Xi(u)\u2212 \u00b5i < 2 \u221a log(T )\nu \u2212 \u00b5i\n] .\nWe consider u0 := d16 log(T )/\u00b52i e which gives that 2 \u221a\nlog(T )/u\u2212 \u00b5i 6 \u2212\u00b5i/2 as soon as u > u0.

Guarantees can be obtained on a relative quantity called regret, which scales linearly with d (or with \u221a d in the minimax sense). We here consider the sparse case of this classical problem in the sense that only a small number of arms, namely s < d, have a positive expected reward. We are able to leverage this additional assumption to provide an algorithm whose regret scales with s instead of d. Moreover, we prove that this algorithm is optimal by providing a matching lower bound \u2013 at least for a wide and pertinent range of parameters that we determine \u2013 and by evaluating its performance on simulated data. *J.
