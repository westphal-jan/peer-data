Introduction", "text": "Differential privacy (Dwork et al., 2006) has emerged as the dominant framework for protected privacy of sensitive training data when releasing learned models to untrusted third parties. This paradigm owes its popularity in part to the strong privacy model provided, and in part to the availability of general building block mechanisms such as the Laplace (Dwork et al., 2006) & exponential (McSherry & Talwar, 2007), and to composition lemmas for building up more complex mechanisms. These generic mechanisms come endowed with privacy and utility bounds that hold for any appropriate application.

For simple scalar statistics of the private database, sensitivity can be easily bounded (Dwork et al., 2006). However in many applications\u2014from collaborative filtering (McSherry & Mironov, 2009) to Bayesian inference (Dimitrakakis et al., 2014; 2017; Wang et al., 2015)\u2014the principal challenge in privatisation is completing this calculation.\nIn this work we develop a simple approach to approximating global sensitivity with high probability, assuming only oracle access to target function evaluations. Combined with generic mechanisms like Laplace, exponential, Gaussian or Bernstein, our sampler enables systematising of privatisation: arbitrary computer programs can be made differentially private with no additional mathematical analysis nor dynamic/static analysis, whatsoever. Our approach does not make any assumptions about the function under evaluation or underlying sampling distribution.\nContributions. This paper contributes: i) SENSITIVITYSAMPLER for easily-implemented empirical estimation of global sensitivity of (potentially black-box) non-private mechanisms; ii) Empirical process theory for guaranteeing random differential privacy for any mechanism that preserves (stronger) differential privacy under bounded global sensitivity; iii) Experiments demonstrating our sampler on learners for which analytical sensitivity bounds are highly involved; and iv) Examples where sensitivity estimates beat (pessimistic) bounds, delivering pain-free random differential privacy at higher levels of accuracy, when used in concert with generic privacy-preserving mechanisms.\nRelated Work. This paper builds on the large body of work in differential privacy (Dwork et al., 2006; Dwork & Roth, 2014), which has gained broad interest in part due the framework\u2019s strong guarantees of data privacy when releasing aggregate statistics or models, and due to availability of many generic privatising mechanisms e.g.,: Laplace (Dwork et al., 2006), exponential (McSherry & Talwar, 2007), Gaussian (Dwork & Roth, 2014), Bernstein (Alda\u0300 & Rubinstein, 2017) and many more. While these mechanisms present a path to privatisation without need for reproving differential privacy or utility, they do have in common a need to analytically bound sensitivity\u2014 a Lipschitz-type condition on the target non-private func-\nar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n02 56\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 8\nJ un\n2 01\n7\ntion. Often derivations are intricate e.g., for collaborative filtering (McSherry & Mironov, 2009), SVMs (Rubinstein et al., 2012; Chaudhuri et al., 2011), model selection (Thakurta & Smith, 2013), feature selection (Kifer et al., 2012), Bayesian inference (Dimitrakakis et al., 2014; 2017; Wang et al., 2015), SGD in deep learning (Abadi et al., 2016), etc. Undoubtedly the non-trivial nature of bounding sensitivity prohibits adoption by some domain experts. We address this challenge through the SENSITIVITYSAMPLER that estimates sensitivity empirically\u2014even for privatising black-box computer programs\u2014providing high probability privacy guarantees generically.\nSeveral systems have been developed to ease deployment of differentially privacy, with Barthe et al. (2016) overviewing contributions from Programming Languages. Dynamic approaches track privacy budget expended at runtime, typically through basic operations on data with known privacy loss, e.g., the PINQ (McSherry, 2009; McSherry & Mahajan, 2010) and Airavat (Roy et al., 2010) systems. These create a C# LINQ-like interface and a framework for bringing differential privacy to MapReduce, respectively. While such approaches are flexible, the lack of static checking means privacy violations are not caught until after (lengthy) computations. Static checking approaches provide forewarning of privacy usage. In this mould, Fuzz (Reed & Pierce, 2010; Palamidessi & Stronati, 2012) offers a higherorder functional language whose static type system tracks sensitivity based on linear logic, so that sensitivity (and therefore differential privacy) is guaranteed by typechecking. Limited to a similar level of program expressiveness as PINQ, Fuzz cannot typecheck many desirable target programs and specifically cannot track data-dependent function sensitivity, with the DFuzz system demonstrating preliminary work towards this challenge (Gaboardi et al., 2013). While promoting privacy-by-design, such approaches impose specialised languages or limit target feasibility\u2014challenges addressed by this work. Moreover our SENSITIVITYSAMPLER mechanism complements such systems, e.g., within broader frameworks for protecting against side-channel attacks (Haeberlen et al., 2011; Mohan et al., 2012).\nMinami et al. (2016) show that special-case Gibbs sampler is ( , \u03b4)-DP without bounded sensitivity. Nissim et al. (2007) ask: Why calibrate for worst-case global sensitivity when the actual database does not witness worst-case neighbours? Their smoothed sensitivity approach privatises local sensitivity, which itself is sensitive to perturbation. While this can lead to better sensitivity estimates, our sampled sensitivity still does not require analytical bounds. A related approach is the sample-and-aggregate mechanism (Nissim et al., 2007) which avoids computation of sensitivity of the underlying target function and instead requires sensitivity of an aggregator combining the outputs of\nthe non-private target run repeatedly on subsamples of the data. By contrast, our approach provides direct sensitivity estimates, permitting direct privatisation.\nOur application of empirical process theory to estimate hard-to-compute quantities resembles the work of Riondato & Upfal (2015). They use VC-theory and sampling to approximate mining frequent itemsets. Here we approximate analytical computations, and to our knowledge provide a first generic mechanism that preserves random differential privacy (Hall et al., 2012)\u2014a natural weakening of the strong guarantee of differential privacy. Hall et al. (2012) leverage empirical process theory for a specific worked example, while our setting is general sensitivity estimation."}, {"heading": "2. Background", "text": "We are interested in non-private mechanism f : Dn \u2192 B that maps databases in product space over domain D to responses in a normed space B. The terminology of \u201cdatabase\u201d (DB) comes from statistical databases, and should be understood as a dataset. Example 1. For instance, in supervised learning of linear classifiers, the domain could be Euclidean vectors comprising features & labels, and responses might be parameterisations of learned classifiers such as a normal vector.\nWe aim to estimate sensitivity which is commonly used to calibrate noise in differentially-private mechanisms. Definition 2. The global sensitivity of non-private f : Dn \u2192 B is given by \u2206 = supD,D\u2032 \u2016f(D)\u2212 f(D\u2032)\u2016B, where the supremum is taken over all pairs of neighbouring databases D,D\u2032 in Dn that differ in one point.

Randomized mechanism M : Dn \u2192 R responding with values in arbitrary response set R preserves -differential privacy for > 0 if for all neighbouring D,D\u2032 \u2208 Dn and measurable R \u2282 R it holds that Pr (M(D) \u2208 R) \u2264 exp( )Pr (M(D\u2032) \u2208 R). If instead for 0 < \u03b4 < 1 it holds that Pr (M(D) \u2208 R) \u2264 exp( )Pr (M(D\u2032) \u2208 R) + \u03b4 then the mechanism preserves the weaker notion of ( , \u03b4)-differential privacy.\nIn Section 4, we recall a number of key mechanisms that preserve these notions of privacy by virtue of target nonprivate function sensitivity.\nThe following definition due to Hall et al. (2012) relaxes the requirement that uniform smoothness of response distribution holds on all pairs of databases, to the requirement that uniform smoothness holds for likely database pairs. Definition 4. Randomized mechanism M : Dn \u2192 R responding with values in an arbitrary response set R preserves ( , \u03b3)-random differential privacy, at privacy level > 0 and confidence \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1), if Pr (\u2200R \u2282 R,Pr (M(D) \u2208 R) \u2264 e Pr (M(D\u2032) \u2208 R)) \u2265\n1 \u2212 \u03b3, with the inner probabilities over the mechanism\u2019s randomization, and the outer probability over neighbouring D,D\u2032 \u2208 Dn drawn from some Pn+1. The weaker ( , \u03b4)-DP has analogous definition as ( , \u03b4, \u03b3)-RDP.\nRemark 5. While strong -DP is ideal, utility may demand compromise. Precedent exists for weaker privacy, with the definition of ( , \u03b4)-DP wherein on any databases (including likely ones) a private mechanism may leak sensitive information on low probability responses, forgiven by the additive \u03b4 relaxation. ( , \u03b3)-RDP offers an alternate relaxation, where on all but a small \u03b3-proportion of unlikely database pairs, strong -DP holds\u2014RDP plays a useful role.\nExample 6. Consider a database on unbounded positive reals D \u2208 Rn+ representing loan default times of a bank\u2019s customers, and target release statistic f(D) = n\u22121 \u2211n i=1Di the sample mean. To -DP privatise scalarvalued f(D) it is natural to look to the Laplace mechanism. However the mechanism requires a bound on the statistic\u2019s global sensitivity, impossible under unbounded D. Note for \u2206 > 0, when neighbouring D,D\u2032 satisfy {|f(D) \u2212 f(D\u2032)| \u2264 \u2206} then Laplace mechanism M\u2206, (f(D)) enjoys -DP on that DB pair. Therefore the probability of the latter event is bounded below by the probability of the former. Modelling the default times by iid exponential variables of rate \u03bb > 0, then |f(D)\u2212 f(D\u2032)| = |Dn \u2212D\u2032n|/n is distributed as Exp(n\u03bb), and so\nPr (\u2200t \u2208 R,Pr (M\u2206, (D) = t) \u2264 e Pr (M\u2206, (D\u2032) = t)) \u2265Pr (|f(D)\u2212 f(D\u2032)| \u2264 \u2206) = 1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bbn\u2206 \u2265 1\u2212 \u03b3 ,\nprovided that \u2206 \u2265 log(1/\u03b3)/(\u03bbn). While -DP fails due to unboundedness, the data is likely bounded and so the mechanism is likely strongly private: M\u2206, is ( , \u03b3)-RDP."}, {"heading": "3. Problem Statement", "text": "We consider a statistician looking to apply a differentiallyprivate mechanism to an f : Dn \u2192 B whose sensitivity cannot easily be bounded analytically (cf. Example 6 or the case of a computer program).\nInstead we assume that the statistician has the ability to sample from some arbitrary product space Pn+1 on Dn+1, can evaluate f arbitrarily (and in particular on the result of this sampling), and is interested in applying a privatising mechanism with the guarantee of random differential privacy (Definition 4).\nRemark 7. Natural choices for P present themselves for sampling or defining random differential privacy. P could be taken as the underlying distribution from which a sensitive DB was drawn\u2014in the case of sensitive training data but insensitive data source; an alternate test distribution of interest in the case of domain adaptation; or P could be uniform or an otherwise non-informative likelihood (cf.\nExample 6). Proved in Appendix A, the following relates RDP of similar distributions.\nProposition 8. Let P,Q be distributions on D with bounded KL divergence KL(P\u2016Q) \u2264 \u03c4 .

In order to reason about such arguments, we introduce the concept of sensitivity-induced differential privacy.\nDefinition 9. For arbitrary mapping f : Dn \u2192 B and randomised mechanism M\u2206 : B \u2192 R, we say that M\u2206 is sensitivity-induced -differentially private if for a neighbouring pair of databases D,D\u2032 \u2208 Dn, and \u2206 \u2265 0\n\u2016f(D)\u2212 f(D\u2032)\u2016B \u2264 \u2206 =\u21d2 \u2200R \u2282 R, Pr (M\u2206(f(D)) \u2208 R)\n\u2264 exp( ) \u00b7 Pr (M\u2206(f(D\u2032)) \u2208 R)\nwith the qualification on R being all measurable subsets of the response set R. In the same vein, the analogous definition for ( , \u03b4)-differential privacy can also be made.\nMany generic mechanisms in use today preserve differential privacy by virtue of satisfying this condition. The following are immediate consequences of existing proofs of differential privacy. First, when a non-private target function f aims to release Euclidean vectors responses.\nCorollary 10 (Laplace mechanism). Consider database D \u2208 Dn, normed space B = (Rd, \u2016 \u00b7 \u20161) for d \u2208 N, nonprivate function f : Dn \u2192 B.

Example 6 used Corollary 10 for RDP of the Laplace mechanism on unbounded bank loan defaults.\nCorollary 12 (Gaussian mechanism). Consider database D \u2208 Dn, normed space B = (Rd, \u2016 \u00b7 \u20162) for some d \u2208 N, and non-private function f : Dn \u2192 B. The Gaussian mechanism (Dwork & Roth, 2014) M\u2206(f(D)) \u223c N (f(D),diag (\u03c3)) with \u03c32 > 2\u22062 log(1.25/\u03b4)/ 2, is sensitivity-induced ( , \u03b4)-differentially private.\nSecond, f may aim to release elements of an arbitrary set R, where a score function s(D, \u00b7) benchmarks quality of potential releases (placing a partial ordering onR).\n1Lap (a, b) has unnormalised PDF exp(\u2212\u2016x\u2212 a\u20161/b).\nAlgorithm 1 SENSITIVITYSAMPLER Input: database size n, target mapping f : Dn \u2192 B, sample size m, order statistic index k, distribution P for i = 1 to m do\nSample D \u223c Pn+1 Set Gi = \u2016f (D1...n)\u2212 f (D1...n\u22121,n+1)\u2016B\nend for Sort G1, . . . , Gm as G(1) \u2264 . . . \u2264 G(m) return \u2206\u0302 = G(k)\nCorollary 13 (Exponential mechanism).

The exponential mechanism (McSherry & Talwar, 2007) M\u2206(f(D)) \u223c exp ( (f(D)) (r)/2\u2206), which when normalised specifies a PDF over responses r \u2208 R, is sensitivity-induced -differentially private.\nThird, f could be function-valued as for learning settings, where given a training set we wish to release a model (e.g., classifier or predictive posterior) that can be subsequently evaluated on (non-sensitive) test points.\nCorollary 14 (Bernstein mechanism). Consider database D \u2208 Dn, query space Y = [0, 1]` with constant dimension ` \u2208 N, lattice cover of Y of size k \u2208 N given by L = ({0, 1/k, . . . , 1})`, normed space B = ( RY , \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e ) , non-private function F : Dn \u00d7 Y \u2192 R, and restriction f : Dn \u2192 B given by f(D) = F (D, \u00b7).

(2011), as that mechanism does not rely directly on a notion of sensitivity of objective function, classifier, or otherwise. However it can apply to the posterior sampler used for differentiallyprivate Bayesian inference (Mir, 2012; Dimitrakakis et al., 2014; 2017; Zhang et al., 2016): there the target function f : Dn \u2192 B returns the likelihood function p(D|\u00b7), itself mapping parameters \u0398 to R; using the result of f(D) and public prior \u03be(\u03b8), the mechanism samples from the posterior \u03be(B|D) = \u222b B p(D|\u03b8)d\u03be(\u03b8)/ \u222b \u0398 p(D|\u03b8)d\u03be(\u03b8); differential privacy follows from a Lipschitz condition on f that would require our sensitivity sampler to sample from all database pairs\u2014a minor modification left for future work."}, {"heading": "5.

A number of natural choices are available for P (cf. Remark 7). The main idea of SENSITIVITYSAMPLER is that for each extended-database observation of D \u223c Pn+1, we induce i.i.d. observations G1, . . . , Gm \u2208 R of the random variable\nG = \u2016f (D1...n)\u2212 f (D1...n\u22121;n+1)\u2016B .\nFrom these observations of the sensitivity of target mapping f : Dn \u2192 B, we estimate w.h.p. sensitivity that can achieve random differential privacy, for the full suite of sensitivity-induced private mechanisms discussed above.\nIf we knew the full CDF of G, we would simply invert this CDF to determine the level of sensitivity for achieving any desired \u03b3 level of random differential privacy: higher confidence would invoke higher sensitivity and therefore lower utility. However as we cannot in general possess the true CDF, we resort to uniformly approximating it w.h.p. using the empirical CDF induced by the sample G1, . . . , Gm. The guarantee of uniform approximation derives from empirical process theory. Figure 1 provides further intuition behind SENSITIVITYSAMPLER. Algorithm 2 presents SAMPLE-THEN-RESPOND which composes SENSITIVITYSAMPLER with any sensitivity-induced differentially-private mechanism.\nOur main result Theorem 15 presents explicit expressions for parameters m, k that are sufficient to guarantee that SAMPLE-THEN-RESPOND achieves ( , \u03b4, \u03b3)-random differential privacy. Under that result the parameter \u03c1, which controls the uniform approximation of the empirical CDF from G1, . . . , Gm sample to the true CDF, is introduced\nas a free parameter. We demonstrate through a series of optimisations in Corollaries 20\u201321 how \u03c1 can be tuned to optimise either sampling effort m, utility via order statistic index k, or privacy confidence \u03b3. These alternative explicit choices for \u03c1 serve as optimal operating points for the mechanism."}, {"heading": "5.1. Practicalities", "text": "SENSITIVITYSAMPLER simplifies the application of differential privacy by obviating the challenge of bounding sensitivity. As such, it is important to explore any practical issues arising in its implementation. The algorithm itself involves few main stages: sampling databases, measuring sensitivity, sorting, order statistic lookup (inversion), followed by the sensitivity-induced private mechanism.\nSampling. As discussed in Remark 7, a number of natural choices for sampling distribution P could be made. Where a simulation process exists, capable of generating synthetic data approximatingD, then this could be run. For example in the Bayesian setting (Dimitrakakis et al., 2014), one could use a public conditional likelihood p(\u00b7|\u03b8), parametric family \u0398, prior \u03be(\u03b8) and sample from the marginal\u222b\n\u0398 p(x|\u03b8)d\u03be(\u03b8). Alternatively, it may suffice to sample from the uniform distribution on D, or Gaussian restricted to EuclideanD. In any of these cases, sampling is relatively straightforward and the choice should consider meaningful random differential privacy guarantees relative to P .\nSensitivity Measurement. A trivial stage, given neighbouring databases, measurement could involve expanding a mathematical expression representing a target function, or a computer program such as running a deep learning or computer vision open-source package. For some targets, it may be that running first on one database, covers much of the computation required for the neighbouring database in which case amortisation may improve runtime. The cost of sensitivity measurement will be primarily determined by sample size m. Note that sampling and measurement can be trivially parallelised over map-reduce-like platforms.\nSorting, Inversion. Strictly speaking the entire sensitivity sample need not be sorted, as only one order statistic is required. That said, sorting even millions of scalar measurements can be accomplished in under a second on a stock machine. An alternative strategy to inversion as presented, is to take the maximum sensitivity measured so as to maximise privacy without consideration to utility.\nMechanism. It is noteworthy that in settings where mechanism M\u2206 is to be run multiple times, the estimation of \u2206\u0302 need not be redone.

The table summarises results with proofs found in Appendix B. The specific expressions derived involve branches of the Lambert-W function, which is the inverse relation of the function f(z) = z exp(z), and is implemented as a special function in scientific libraries as standard. While Lambert-W is in general a multi-valued relation on the analytic complex domain, all instances in our results are single-real-valued functions on the reals. The next result presents the first operating point\u2019s corresponding rate on effort in terms of privacy, and follows from recent bounds on the secondary branchW\u22121 due to Chatzigeorgiou (2013).2\nCorollary 16.

Theorem 15 and Table 1 elucidate that effort, privacy and utility are in tension. Effort is naturally decreased by reducing the confidence level of RDP (\u03c1 chosen to minimise m, or \u03b3). By minimising order statistic index k, we select smaller Gk and therefore sensitivity estimate \u2206\u0302. This in turn leads to lower generic mechanism noise and higher utility. All this is achieved by sacrificing effort or privacy confidence. As usual, sacrificing or \u03b4 privacy levels also leads to utility improvement. Figures 2 and 3 visualise these operating points.\nLess conservative estimates on sensitivity can lead to superior utility while also enjoying easier implementation. This hypothesis is borne out in experiments in Section 7.\nProposition 18.

We present experimental evidence of this utility savings in Section 7.3. While application domains may find the alternate balance towards utility appealing by itself, it should be stressed that a significant advantage of SENSITIVITYSAMPLER is its ease of implementation."}, {"heading": "7.1.

Global Sensitivity vs. Sampled Sensitivity", "text": "Consider now the challenging goal of privately releasing an SVM classifier fit to sensitive training data. In applying the Laplace mechanism to releasing the primal normal vector, Rubinstein et al. (2012) bound the vector\u2019s sensitivity using algorithmic stability of the SVM.

While the original work (and others since) did not consider the practical problem of releasing unregularised bias term b, we can effectively bound this sensitivity via a short argument in Appendix D.\nProposition 19. For the SVM run with hinge loss, linear kernel, D = [0, 1]d, the release (w, b) has L1 global sensitivity bounded by 2 + 2C \u221a d+ 4Cd/n.\nWe train private SVM using the Laplace mechanism (Rubinstein et al., 2012), with global sensitivity bound of Proposition 19 or SENSITIVITYSAMPLER. We synthesise a dataset of n = 1000 points, selected with equal probability of being drawn from the positive class N(0.2 \u00b7 1,diag(0.01)) or negative class N(0.8 \u00b7 1,diag(0.01)). The feature space\u2019s dimension varies from d = 8 through d = 64. The SVMs are run with C = 3, SENSITIVITYSAMPLER with m = 1500 & varying \u03b3. Figure 5 shows very different sensitivities obtained. While estimated \u2206\u0302 hovers around 0.01 largely independent of \u03b3, global sen-\nsitivity \u2206 exceeds 20\u2014two orders of magnitude greater. These patterns are repeated as dimension increases; sensitivity increasing is to be expected since as dimensions are added, the few points in the training set become more likely to be support vectors and thus affecting sensitivity. Such conservative estimates could clearly lead to inferior utility."}, {"heading": "7.3. Effect on Utility", "text": "Support Vector Classification. We return to the same SVM setup as in the previous section, with d = 2, now plotting utility as misclassification error (averaged over 500 repeats) vs. privacy budget . Here we set \u03b3 = 0.05 and include also the non-private SVM\u2019s performance as a bound on utility possible. See Figure 6. At very high privacy levels both private SVMs suffer the same poor error. But quickly with lower privacy, the misclassification error of SENSITIVITYSAMPLER drops until it reaches the nonprivate rate. Simultaneously the global sensitivity approach has a significantly higher value and suffers a much slower decline. These results suggest that SENSITIVITYSAMPLER can achieve much better utility in addition to sensitivity.\nKernel Density Estimation. We finally consider a one dimensional (d = 1) KDE setting. In Figure 7 we show the error (averaged over 1000 repeats) of the Bernstein mechanism (with lattice size k = 10 and Bernstein order h = 3) on 5000 points drawn from a mixture of two normal distributions N(0.5, 0.02) and N(0.75, 0.005) with weights 0.4, 0.6, respectively. For this experimental result, we set m = 50000 and two different values for \u03b3, as displayed in Figure 7. Once again we observe that for high privacy levels the global sensitivity approach incurs a higher error relative to non-private, while SENSITIVITYSAMPLER provides stronger utility. At lower privacy, both approaches converge to the approximation error of the Bernstein polynomial used."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we propose SENSITIVITYSAMPLER, an algorithm for empirical estimation of sensitivity for privatisation of black-box functions. Our work addresses an important usability gap in differential privacy, whereby several generic privatisation mechanisms exist complete with privacy and utility guarantees, but require analytical bounds on global sensitivity (a Lipschitz condition) on the non-private target. While this sensitivity is trivially derived for simple statistics, for state-of-the-art learners sensitivity derivations are arduous e.g., in collaborative filtering (McSherry & Mironov, 2009), SVMs (Rubinstein et al., 2012; Chaudhuri et al., 2011), model selection (Thakurta & Smith, 2013), feature selection (Kifer et al., 2012), Bayesian inference (Dimitrakakis et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015), and deep learning (Abadi et al., 2016).\nWhile derivations may prevent domain experts from leveraging differential privacy, our SENSITIVITYSAMPLER promises to make privatisation simple when using existing mechanisms including Laplace (Dwork et al., 2006), Gaussian (Dwork & Roth, 2014), exponential (McSherry & Talwar, 2007) and Bernstein (Alda\u0300 & Rubinstein, 2017). All such mechanisms guarantee differential privacy on pairs of databases for which a level \u2206 of non-private function sensitivity holds, when the mechanism is run with that \u2206 parameter. For all such mechanisms we leverage results from empirical process theory to establish guarantees of random differential privacy (Hall et al., 2012) when using sampled sensitivities only.\nExperiments demonstrate that real-world learners can easily be run privately without any new derivation whatsoever. And by using a naturally-weaker form of privacy, while replacing worst-case global sensitivity bounds with estimated (actual) sensitivities, we can achieve far superior utility than existing approaches."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "F.

This corresponds to optimising the expression (9) with respect to \u03c1. Noting that this expression is identical to the objective (8), again the global optimiser must be \u03c1? = exp(W\u22121(\u22121/(4m))/2). With this choice of \u03b3, the necessary k equates to m."}, {"heading": "C.
