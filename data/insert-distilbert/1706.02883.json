Each news headline (i.e., news title) is required to be classified into one or more predefined categories. With the rise of Internet and social media, the text data on the web is growing exponentially. Make a human being to analysis all those data is impractical, while machine learning techniques suits perfectly for this kind of tasks. after all, human brain capacity is too limited and precious for tedious and non-obvious phenomenons.\nFormally, the task is defined as follows: given a news headline x = (x1, x2, ..., xn), where xj represents jth word in x, the object is to find its possible category or label c \u2208 C. More specifically, we need to find a function to predict in which category does x belong to.\nc\u2217 = arg max c\u2208C f(x; \u03b8c), (1)\nwhere \u03b8 is the parameter for the function."}, {"heading": "2 Data", "text": "We collected news headlines (titles) from several Chinese news websites, such as toutiao, sina, and so on.\nThere are 18 categories in total.
