INTRODUCTION\nTHE so-called Symbol Grounding Problem (SGP, [1], [2],[3]) refers to how a cognitive agent forms an internal and unified representation of an external word referent from the continuous flow of low-level sensorimotor data generated by its interaction with the environment. In this paper, we focus on solving the SGP in the context of human-robot interaction (HRI), where a humanoid iCub robot [4] acquires and expresses knowledge about the world by interacting with a human partner. Solving the SGP is of particular relevance in HRI, where a repertoire of shared symbolic units forms the basis of an efficient linguistic communication channel between the robot and the human.\nTo solve the SGP, several questions should be addressed: \u2022 How are unified symbolic representations of external\nreferents acquired from the multimodal information collected by the agent (e.g., visual, tactile, motor)? This is referred to as the Physical SGP [?], [13]. \u2022 How to acquire a shared lexicon grounded in the sensorimotor interactions between two (or more) agents? This is referred to as the Social SGP [13], [14]. \u2022 How is this lexicon then used for communication and collective goal-oriented behavior? This refers to the functional role of physical and social symbol grounding.\n*C. Moulin-Frier and T. Fischer contributed equally to this work.\nThis paper addresses these questions by proposing a complete cognitive architecture for HRI and demonstrating its abilities on an iCub robot. Our architecture, called DACh3, builds upon our previous research projects in conceiving\nar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n03 66\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 2\nJu n\n20 17\nbiologically grounded cognitive architectures for humanoid robots based on the Distributed Adaptive Control theory of mind and brain (DAC, presented in the next section). In [?] we proposed an integrated architecture for generating a socially competent humanoid robot, demonstrating that gaze, eye contact and utilitarian emotions play an essential role in the psychological validity or social salience of HRI (DACh1). In [?], we introduced a unified robot architecture, an innovative Synthetic Tutor Assistant (STA) embodied in a humanoid robot whose goal is to interactively guide learners in a science-based learning paradigm through rich multimodal interactions (DAC-h2).\nDAC-h3 is based on a developmental bootstrapping process where the robot is endowed with an intrinsic motivation to act and relate to the world in interaction with social peers. This is referred to by Levinson [15] as the human interaction engine: a set of capabilities including looking at objects of interest and interaction partners, pointing to these entities [16], curiosity as a desire to acquire knowledge [17], as well as showing, telling and sharing of knowledge with others [16], [18]. This interaction engine drives the robot to proactively control its own acquisition and expression of knowledge, favoring the grounding of acquired symbols by learning multimodal representations of entities through interaction with a human partner. In DAC-h3, an entity refers to an internal or external referent: it can be either an object, an agent, an action, or a body part. In turn, the acquired multimodal and linguistic representations of entities are recruited in goal-oriented behavior and form the basis of a persistent concept of self through the development of an autobiographical memory and the expression of a verbal narrative.\nWe validate the proposed architecture following a humanrobot interaction scenario where the robot has to learn concepts related to its own body and its vicinity in a proactive manner, as well to express those concepts in goal-oriented behavior. We show a complete implementation running in real-time on the iCub humanoid robot. The interaction depends on the internal dynamics of the architecture, the properties of the environment, as well as the behavior of the human. We analyze a typical interaction in detail and provide videos showing the robustness of our system in various environments (http:// clement-moulin-frier.github.io/dac-h3/). Our results show that the architecture autonomously drives the iCub to acquire various concepts about the present entities (objects, humans, and body parts), proactively maintaining the interaction with a human and recruiting those concepts to express more complex goal-oriented behavior.\nIn Section II we position the current contribution with respect to related works in the field and rely on this analysis to emphasize the specificity of our approach. Our main contribution is described in Section III and consists in the proposition and implementation of an embodied and integrated cognitive architecture for the acquisition of multimodal information about external word referents, as well as a context-dependent lexicon shared with a human partner and used in goal-directed behavior and verbal narrative generation. The experimental validation of our approach on an iCub robot is provided in Section IV, followed by a discussion."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORKS AND PRINCIPLES OF THE PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE", "text": "In this section, we review related works on each of the topics related to the features of the proposed cognitive architecture. Those features are: (A) a biologically-grounded cognitive architecture ensuring autonomy, learning and goaloriented behavior; (B) the ability to solve the SGP by the acquisition of symbols grounded in the physical interaction with the (social) environment; (C) proactivity as a way to improve HRI and self-monitor knowledge acquisition; (D) goal-oriented behavior supported by the learned symbol; as well as (E) autobiographical memory expressed through a verbal narrative. Each of the subsections below presents related works in these topics, and briefly describes how the presented contribution addresses them."}, {"heading": "A. Functionally-driven vs. biologically-inspired approaches in social robotics", "text": "Conceiving socially interactive robots relies on two main approaches [19]. On the one hand, functionally-designed approaches are based on reverse engineering methods, assuming that a deep understanding of how the mind operates is not a requirement for conceiving socially competent robots (e.g. [20], [21], [22]). On the other hand, biologically-inspired robots are based on theories of natural and social sciences and expect two main advantages of constraining cognitive models by biological knowledge: to conceive robots better understandable by humans since they are built from similar principles, and to provide an efficient experimental benchmark from which the underlying theories can be confronted, tested and refined (e.g. [23], [24]).\nThe proposed DAC-h3 cognitive architecture takes advantage of both methods. It is based on an established biologically-grounded cognitive architecture of the brain and the mind (the DAC theory, presented below) that is here adapted for the HRI domain. However, whereas the global structure of the architecture is constrained by biology, the actual implementation of specific modules composing it can sometimes be driven by their functionality, i.e. using stateof-the-art methods from machine learning that are powerful at implementing a particular function without being directly constrained by biological knowledge."}, {"heading": "B. Cognitive architectures and the SGP", "text": "Another distinction in approaches for conceiving social robots, which is of particular relevance for addressing the SGP, reflects an historical distinction from the more general field of cognitive architectures (or unified theories of cognition [25]). Historically, two opposite approaches have been proposed formalizing how cognitive functions arise in an individual agent from the interaction of interconnected information processing modules structured in a cognitive architecture. On one hand, top-down approaches rely on a symbolic representation of a task, which has to be decomposed recursively into simpler ones to be executed by the agent. They mostly rely on methods from symbolic artificial intelligence (from the General\nProblem Solver [26] to Soar [27] or ACT-R [28]). Although relatively powerful at solving abstract symbolic problems, topdown architectures are not able to solve the SGP per se because they presuppose the existence of symbols and therefore are not suitable for addressing how they are acquired from low-level sensorimotor signals. On the other hand, bottomup approaches instead implement behavior without relying on complex knowledge representation and reasoning. This is typically the case in behavior-based robotics [29], emphasizing lower-level sensory-motor control loops as a starting point of behavioral complexity as in the Subsumption architecture [30]. Those approaches are not suitable to solve the SGP either because they do not consider symbolic representation as a necessary component of cognition (referred as intelligence without representation in [29]). Interestingly, this distinction between top-down representation-based and bottom-up behavior-based approaches still holds in the domain of social robotics [31], [32].\nTop-down representation-based approaches rely on modeling psychological aspects of social cognition (e.g. [33]), whereas bottom-up behavior-based approaches emphasize the role of embodiment and reactive control to enable the dynamic coupling of agents [34]. Solving the SGP, both in its physical and social aspects, therefore requires an integration of bottomup processes for acquiring and grounding symbols in the physical interaction with the (social) environment, with topdown processes for taking advantage of the abstraction, reasoning and communication abilities provided by the acquired symbol system. This has been referred as the micro-macro loop, i.e. a bilateral relationship between an emerged symbol system at the macro level and a physical system consisting of communicating and collaborating agents at the micro level [35].\nSeveral contributions in social robotics rely on such hybrid architectures integrating bottom-up and top-down processes (e.g. [38], [37], [36], [?]). In [36], an architecture called embodied theory of mind was developed to link high-level cognitive skills to the low-level perceptual abilities of a humanoid and implementing joint attention and intentional state understanding. In [37] or [38], the architecture combines deliberative planning, reactive control, and motivational drives for controlling robots in interaction with humans.\nIn this paper, we adopt the principles of the Distributed Adaptive Control theory of the mind and the brain (DAC, [39], [40]). DAC is a hybrid architecture which posits that cognition is based on the interaction of four interconnected control loops operating at different levels of abstraction (see Figure 1). The first level is called the somatic layer and corresponds to the embodiment of the agent within its environment, with its sensors and actuators as well as the physiological needs (e.g. for exploration or safety). Extending bottom-up approaches with drive reduction mechanisms, complex behavior is bootstrapped in DAC from the self-regulation of an agent\u2019s physiological needs when combined with reactive behaviors (the reactive layer). This reactive interaction with the environment drives the dynamics of the whole architecture [41], bootstrapping learning processes for solving the physical SGP (the adaptive layer) and the acquisition of higher-level cognitive represen-\ntations such as abstract goal selection, memory and planning (the contextual layer). These high-level representations in turn modulate the activity at the lower levels via top-down pathways shaped by behavioral feedback. The control flow in DAC is therefore distributed, both from bottom-up and top-down interactions between layers, as well as from lateral information processing into the subsequent layers."}, {"heading": "C. Solving the SGP", "text": "Other contributions have focused on the grounding of a lexicon from the physical interaction of a robot with its environment. Since the pioneering paradigm of \u201clanguage games\u201d proposed in [42], a number of multi-agent models have been proposed showing how particular properties of language can self-organize out of repeated dyadic interactions between agents of a population (e.g. [43], [44]). In the domain of HRI, contributions have focused on lexicon acquisition through the transfer of sensorimotor and linguistic information from the interaction between a teacher and a learner through imitation [45], action [46], [47] or active exploration [48]. In all these contributions, solving the SGP requires integrating multimodal information about external world entities (physical SGP) with linguistic labels acquired or negotiated through the interaction with social peers (social SGP).\nIn the proposed DAC-h3 architecture, entities refer to either object, agents, actions or body parts. Visual, tactile, motor and linguistic information about the present entities is collected proactively through reactive control loops triggering knowledge acquisition and expression behaviors in interaction with a human partner. An entity is therefore represented internally in the robot\u2019s memory as the association between multimodal representations and linguistic labels."}, {"heading": "D. Autonomous exploration and proactive behavior in HRI", "text": "Significant progress has been made in allowing robots to interact with humans, for example in learning shared plans [5], [6], [7], learning to imitate actions [8], [9], [10], and learning motor skills [11] that could be used for engaging in joint activities. In most of these interactions, the human is in charge and the robot is following the human\u2019s lead: the choice of the concept to learn is left to the human and the robot must identify it. In this case, the robot must solve the referential indeterminacy problem described by Quine [12], where the robot language learner has to extract the external concept that was referred to by a human speaker. However, acquiring symbols by interacting with other agents is not only an unidirectional process of information transfer between a teacher and learner [15].\nAutonomous exploration and proactive behavior allow robots to take the initiative in exploring their environment [49] and interacting with people [50]. The benefit of these abilities for knowledge acquisition has been demonstrated in several HRI experiments. In [48], it is shown how a combination of social guidance and intrinsic motivation improve the learning of object visual categories in HRI. In [51], planning conflicts due to the uncertainty of the detected human\u2019s intention are resolved by proactive execution of the corresponding task that\noptimally reduces the system\u2019s uncertainty. In [52], the task is to acquire human-understandable labels for novel objects and learning how to manipulate them. This is realized through a mixed-initiative interaction scenario and it is shown that proactivity improves the predictability and success of humanrobot interaction.\nA central aspect of the DAC-h3 architecture is the robot\u2019s ability to act proactively in a mixed-initiative scenario. This allows the self-monitoring of the robot\u2019s own knowledge acquisition process, instead of only relying on the human\u2019s initiative. Interestingly, proactivity in a sense reverses the referential indeterminacy problem mentioned above, by shifting the responsibility of solving ambiguities to the agent who is endowed with the adequate prior knowledge to solve it, i.e., the human in a HRI context. The robot is now in charge of the concepts it wants to learn, and can use joint attention behaviors to guide the human toward the knowledge it wants to acquire. In the proposed system, this is realized through a set of behavioral control loops, self-regulating knowledge acquisition, and proactively requesting missing information about entities from the human partner."}, {"heading": "E. Language learning, autobiographical memory and narrative expression", "text": "Several works address the ability of language learning in robotics. The cognitive architecture of iTalk [53] focuses on modeling the emergence of language by learning about the robot\u2019s embodiment, learning from others, as well as learning linguistic capability. Cangelosi et al. [54] propose that action, interaction and language should be considered together as they develop in parallel, and one influences the others. Antunes et al. [55] assume that language is already learned, and address the issue that linguistic input typically does not have a one-to-one mapping to actions. They propose to perform reasoning and planning on three different layers (low-level robot perception and action execution, mid-level goal formulation and plan execution, and high-level semantic memory) to interpret the human instructions. Similarly, [56] proposes a system to recognize novel objects using language capabilities in one shot. In these works, language is typically used to understand the human and perform actions, but not necessarily to talk about past events which the robot has experienced.\nVarious works investigate the expression of past events by developing narratives based on acquired autobiographical memories [57], [58], [59]. In [59], a user study is presented which suggests that a robot\u2019s narrative allows humans to get an insight to long term human-robot interaction from the robot\u2019s perspective. The method in [58] takes user preferences into account when referring to past interactions. Similarly to our framework, it is based on the implementation and cooperation between both episodic and semantic memories with a dialog system. However, no learning capabilities (neither language nor knowledge) are introduced by the authors.\nIn the proposed DAC-h3 architecture, the acquired lexicon allows the robot to execute action plans for achieving goaloriented behavior from human speech requests. Relevant information throughout the interaction of the robot with humans\nis continuously stored in an autobiographical memory used for the generation of a narrative self, i.e., a verbal description of the own robot\u2019s history over the long term (able to store and verbally describe interactions from a long time ago, e.g. several months ago).\nIn the next section, we describe how the above features are implemented in a coherent cognitive architecture relying on functional modules which are implemented as YARP [60] modules running in real-time on the iCub robot."}, {"heading": "III. THE DAC-H3 COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE", "text": "This section presents the DAC-h3 architecture in detail, which is an instantiation of the DAC architecture for humanrobot interaction. The proposed architecture provides a general framework for designing autonomous robots which act proactively for 1) maintaining social interaction with humans, 2) bootstrapping the association of multimodal knowledge with its environment that further enrich the interaction through goaloriented action plans, and 3) express a verbal narrative. It allows a principled organization of various functional modules into a biologically grounded cognitive architecture.\nIn DAC-h3, the somatic layer consists of an iCub humanoid robot equipped with advanced motor and sensory abilities for interacting with humans and objects. The reactive layer ensures the autonomy of the robot through drive reduction mechanisms implementing proactive behaviors for acquiring and expressing knowledge about the current scene. The adaptive layer learns high-level multimodal representations (visual, tactile, motor and linguistic) for the categorization of entities (objects, agents, actions and body parts) and associates them in unified representations. Finally, the contextual layer deals with goal representation and action planning, as well as the formation of an autobiographical memory of the robot that can be expressed in the form of a verbal narrative.\nThe complete DAC-h3 architecture is shown on Figure 1. It is composed of structural modules reflecting the cognitive modules proposed by the DAC theory. Each structural module possibly relies on one or more functional modules implementing more specific functionalities (e.g. dealing with motor control, object perception, and scene representation). In this section, we describe each structural module layer by layer, as well as their interaction with the functional modules."}, {"heading": "A. Somatic layer", "text": "The somatic layer corresponds to the physical embodiment of the system. We use the iCub robot, an open source humanoid platform developed for research in cognitive robotics [4]. The iCub is a 104 cm tall humanoid robot with 53 degrees of freedom (DOF). It has two dexterous hands with 19 underactuated joints and 9 DOF each. The robot is equipped with cameras in its articulated eyes allowing stereo vision, and tactile sensors in the fingertips, palms of the hand, arms and torso. The iCub is augmented with an external RGB-D camera above the robot head for agent detection and skeleton tracking. Finally, an external microphone and speakers are used for speech recognition and synthesis, respectively.\nThe somatic layer also contains the physiological needs of the robot that will drive its reactive behaviors, as described in the following section on the reactive layer."}, {"heading": "B. Reactive layer", "text": "Following DAC principles, the reactive layer oversees the self-regulation of the internal drives of a cognitive agent from the interaction of sensorimotor control loops. The drives aim at self-regulating internal state variables (the needs of the somatic layer) within their respective homeostatic ranges. In biological terms, such an internal state variable could for example reflect the current glucose level in an organism, with the associated homeostatic range defining the minimum and maximum values of that level. A drive for eating would then correspond to a self-regulation mechanism where the agent actively searches for food whenever its glucose level is below the homeostatic minimum, and stops eating even if food is present whenever it is above the homeostatic maximum. A drive is therefore defined as the real-time control loop triggering appropriate behaviors whenever the associated internal state variable goes out of its homeostatic range, as a way to self-regulate its value in a dynamic and autonomous way.\nIn the social robotics context that is considered in this paper, the drives of the robot do not reflect biological needs as above, but are rather related to knowledge acquisition and expression in social interaction. At the foundation of this developmental bootstrapping process is the intrinsic motivation to interact and communicate. As described by Levinson [15], a part of the human interaction engine is a set of capabilities that include the motivation to interact and communicate through universal (language independent) manners; including looking at objects of interest and at the interaction partner, and pointing to these objects. These reactive capabilities are built into the reactive layer of the architecture forming the core of the DAC-h3 interaction engine. These interaction primitives allow the DAC-h3 system and the human to share attention around specific entities (body parts, objects, or agents), bootstrapping learning mechanisms in the adaptive layer that associate visual, tactile, motor and linguistic representations of entities (see next section on the adaptive layer).\nCurrently the architecture implements the following two drives, however DAC-h3 is designed in a way that facilitates the addition of new drives for further advancements. First, a drive for knowledge acquisition provides the iCub with an intrinsic motivation to acquire new knowledge about the current scene. The internal variable associated with this drive is modulated by the number of entities (object, agents, body parts, etc.) in the current scene with missing information (e.g. unknown name, or missing property). The self-regulation of this drive is realized by proactively requesting the human to provide missing information about entities, for instance their name via speech, synchronized with gaze and pointing; or asking the human to touch its skin associated to a specific body part. Second, a drive for knowledge expression allows the iCub to proactively express its acquired knowledge by interacting with the human and objects. The internal variable associated with this drive is modulated by the number of\nentities in the current scene without missing information. The self-regulation is then realized by triggering actions toward the known entities, synchronized with verbal descriptions of those actions (e.g. pointing towards an object or moving a specific body part, while referring verbally to the considered entity).\nThe implementation of these drives is realized through the three structural modules described below, interacting with each other as well as with the surrounding layers: 1) sensations, 2) allostatic controller, and 3) behaviors (see Figure 1).\n1) Sensations: The sensations module pre-processes the data acquired by the sensors at the somatic level: the positions of entities present in the current scene (objects and the human), their visual salience, skeleton information from the RGB-D camera, as well as information indicating the presence or absence of the entity properties (linguistic label, or in case of body parts touch and motor information). The sensations module relies on several functional modules described below. Agent detector and the prediction, anticipation, sensation, attention and response module maintain information relative to the position of each entity and its respective salience, as well as speech recognition which deals with speech-to-text processing to provide relevant information for meaning extraction in the adaptive layer.\nThe agent detector is a functional module processing information gathered by the RGB-D camera and concerning a human agent present in the scene. This includes the location of the body parts of the human (of interest in this paper is the head location for gazing at the partner, the location of the hands for detecting pointing actions of the human, as well as the face image of the agent for face recognition.\nThe prediction, anticipation, sensation, attention and response (PASAR, [?]) functional module analyses the salience of entities in the world. The salience of an object is increased through acceleration of the entity, its appearance and disappearance, the human pointing to the object; and decreases when the iCub looks at the entity. The module receives information about properties of detected entities (position, color, presence), and about the human interaction with them (pointing to, waving to, etc.). After performing analysis of the salience of the object, the system generates the updated salience for the entities. This can be used to guide the gaze to the most pertinent objects.\nThe speech recognition functional module extracts text from human speech sensed by a microphone, using the MicrosoftTM speech API. With a given grammar provided by different modules or given by default, this module returns the sentence heard by the robot in textual form. This will be further processed in the adaptive layer described in the next section to extract meaning from those sentences.\n2) Allostatic Controller: In many situations, several drives which may conflict with each other, can be activated at the same time (in the case of this paper, the drive for knowledge acquisition and the drive for knowledge exploration). Such possible conflicts can be solved through the concept of an allostatic controller [61], [62], defined as a set of simple homeostatic control loops and dealing with their scheduling to ensure an efficient global regulation of the internal state variables. According to the internal state of the robot and\nthe output of the sensations module, the allostatic controller updates the drive levels in real-time and has the role of deciding which drive to regulate at the current time. For example, the knowledge acquisition drive is modulated by the amount of unknown information about the entities present in the current scene, whereas the knowledge expression drive is modulated by the amount of already acquired information about the entities present in the current scene. The decision of which drive to follow depends on several factors: the distance of each drive level to their homeostatic boundaries, as well as predefined drive priorities (in DAC-h3, knowledge acquisition has priority over knowledge expression, which results in a curious personality).\n3) Behaviors: To regulate the aforementioned drives, the allostatic controller is connected to the behaviors module, and each drive is linked to corresponding behaviors which are supposed to bring it back into its homeostatic range whenever needed. The drive for knowledge acquisition is regulated by requiring information about entities through coordinated behaviors. Those behaviors depend on the type of the considered entity:\n\u2022 In case of an object, the robot produces speech (e.g. \u201cWhat is this object?\u201d) while pointing and gazing at the unknown object. \u2022 In case of an agent, the robot produces speech (e.g. \u201cWho are you?\u201d) while looking at the unknown human. \u2022 In case of a body part, the robot either asks for the name (e.g. \u201cHow do you call this part of my body?\u201d) while moving it or, if the name is already known from a previous interaction, asks the human to touch the body part while moving it (e.g., \u201cCan you touch my index while I move it, please?\u201d).\nThe multimodal information collected through these behaviors will be used to form unified representation of entities in the adaptive layer (see next section).\nThe drive for knowledge expression is regulated by executing actions towards known entities, synchronized with speech sentences parameterized by the entities\u2019 linguistic labels acquired in the adaptive layer (see next section).\nMotor actions are realized through the action rendering engine (ARE [63]) functional module, executing complex actions (e.g. push, reach, take, look) in terms of primitive motor movements in both the joint and the Cartesian space. The ARE system takes as input the label of the requested action (e.g. push) along with the 3D coordinates of the object (provided by the sensations module) over which the action needs to be executed. The whole trajectory gets decomposed in multiple trajectories via points whose intermediate movements are resolved by means of a non-linear constraints optimization, and then performed by a multi-referential operational controller as described in [63]. The robot executes the motor actions moving its limbs in a coordinated human-like fashion.\nLanguage production abilities are also present in the reactive layer, implemented in the form of predefined grammars (for example naming an object or requesting information about it). Semantic words associated to entities are not present at the reactive level, but are provided from the learned association operating in the adaptive layer (see next section). The iSpeak\nmodule implements a bridge between the iCub and a voice synthesizer (e.g. Festival1, Acapela2) by synchronizing the produced utterance from a string with the LEDs of the iCub\u2019s mouth, producing lips movements to realize a more vivid interaction [64].\nThe positive influence of such a drive regulation mechanism on the acceptance of the HRI by naive users has been demonstrated in previous papers [65], [66]. In this paper, the focus is on its integration with an adaptive and contextual layer, as described in the next two sections, providing a complete cognitive architecture for HRI."}, {"heading": "C. Adaptive layer", "text": "The adaptive layer oversees the acquisition of a state space of the agent-environment interaction by binding visual, tactile, motor and linguistic representations of entities. It integrates functional modules for maintaining an internal representation of the current scene, visually categorizing entities, recognizing and sensing body parts, extracting linguistic labels from human speech, and learning associations between multimodal representations. They are grouped in three structural modules described below: perceptions, associations and action selection (see Figure 1).\n1) Perceptions: The object recognition functional module [67] is used to learn the categorization of objects directly from the visual information given by the iCub eyes. It provides a complete chain to address the real-world object recognition problem by coding the images with resort to the most recent deep convolutional networks, and successively applying a support vector machine linear classification. The input to this system are images acquired from the robot cameras containing the objects we aim to recognize. Objects are segmented out of the background relying on the local binary pattern technique; their bounding boxes are then fed to the learning module for the recognition stage. The whole chain can run in near realtime. The output of the system consists of the 2D (in the image plane) and 3D (in the world frame) positions of the identified objects along with the corresponding classification scores as stored in the objects properties collector memory (explained below).\nThe transformation of human speech into meaning (comprehension of narrative discourse) and vice versa (production of narrative discourse) is realized by the language reservoir handler (LRH). These models (comprehension and production of narrative discourse) are recurrent neuronal networks based on reservoir computing [68], [69], [70]. The model of narrative discourse production (meaning to speech) receives a representation of meaning and generates the corresponding sentence. The narrative discourse comprehension model is the opposite of the production model. It receives a sentence and produces the representation of the corresponding meaning, which is based on the theory of Goldberg [71] who proposes a tight correspondence between the structure of perceptual events that are basic to human experience, and constructions for the corresponding basic sentence types. In a simplistic way, this cor-\n1http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/ 2http://www.acapela-group.com/\nresponds to saying that the meaning of a sentence is contained in the semantic words that compose it. Thereby, we represent the meaning in term of PAOR: predicate(arguments) where arguments correspond to thematic roles (agent,object,recipient). These thematic roles called \u201cOpen Class Words\u201d (OCW) are at the interface of syntax and semantics. They are a first level of \u201cpoor\u201d semantics. From a syntactic point of view, thematic roles are linked to grammatical functions (such as to, the, in, on, a) also called \u201cClosed Class Words\u201d (CCW). The first role we can define is the \u201cagent\u201d role (such as I, John, iCub). It typically characterizes a person or entity with intelligence and cognitive properties that initiates or undergoes an action described by a verb (such as put, push, feel). We then find the notion of \u201cpatient\u201d or \u201crecipient\u201d (iCub gives the box to John, in this example, the recipient is John), which characterizes the entity that undergoes the action described by the predicate. The \u201cpredicate\u201d thematic role represents the key thematic role of an action. In case of narrative structure, we can also find narrative function words like \u201cbefore\u201d, \u201cthen\u201d, etc. This meaning representation in term of PAOR corresponds to the format of data contained in the autobiographical memory described in the next section (contextual layer).\nThe synthetic sensory memory (SSM) module provides abilities for pattern learning, recall, pattern completion and association, as defined by experimental psychologists and neuroscientists [86]. The functionality in SSM draws inspiration from the role of the hippocampus by fusing multiple sensory input streams and representing them in a latent feature space, which emerges as Deep Gaussian Processes [87] are used as the underlying technology. SSM takes various data as input as provided from the sensations module, e.g. vision, auditory, and touch information. SSM is capable of voluntary recall, involuntary recall, as well as imagination. During voluntary recall, SSM performs classification of incoming sensory data and returns a label along with an uncertainty measure corresponding to the returned label. SSM is also capable of imagining novel inputs or reconstructing previously encountered inputs and sending the corresponding generated sensory data which allows for the replay of memories using the visual memory inspector [88]. In DAC-h3, SSM is currently employed for face recognition and action recognition using a fusion of RGB-D data and object location data. In terms of action recognition, SSM has been trained to automatically segment and recognize the following actions: push, pull, lift, drop, wave, and point, while also actively recognizing if the current action is known or unknown.\n2) Associations: The associations structural module produces unified representations of entities by associating the multimodal categories formed in the perception module. Those unified representations are formed in the objects properties collector (OPC), a functional module storing all information associated with a particular entity at the present moment in a proto-language format as detailed in [65]. An entity is defined as a concept which can be manipulated, and is thus the basis for emerging knowledge. In DAC-h3, each entity has a name associated, which might be unknown if the entity has been discovered but not yet explored. More specifically, higher level entities such as objects, body parts and agents have additional\nintrinsic properties. For example, an object also has a location and dimensions associated to it. Furthermore, whether the object is currently present is encoded as well, and if so, its saliency value (as computed by the PASAR module described in Section III-B). On the other hand, a body part is an entity which contains a proprioceptive property (i.e. a specific iCub\u2019s joint), and a tactile information property (i.e. which tactile sensor are associated to it). Thus, the OPC allows integrating multiple modalities of one and the same entity to ground the knowledge about the self, other agents, and objects, as well as their relations. Relations can be used to link several instances in an ontological model (see III-D1 Episodic Memory).\nLearning the multimodal associations that form the internal representations of entities relies on the behavior generated by the knowledge acquisition drive operating at the reactive level (see previous section). Multimodal information about entities generated by those behaviors is bound together by registering the acquired information in the specific data format used by the OPC. For instance, the language reservoir handler module described above deals with speech analysis to extract entity labels from human replies (e.g. \u201cthis is a cube\u201d; {P:is, A:this, O:cube, R:\u2205}). The extracted labels are associated with the acquired multimodal information which depends on the entity type: visual representations generated by the object recognition module in case of an object or agent detector in case of an agent, as well as motor and touch information in case of a body part.\nThe associations of representations can also be applied to the developmental robot itself (instead of external entities as above), to acquire motor capabilities or to learn the links between motor joints and skin sensors of its body [72]. Learning self-related representations of the robot\u2019s own body schema is realized by the sensorimotor representation learning functional module dedicated to forward model learning by means of an online heterogeneous ensemble of predictors [73]. This learning method achieves predictions which are more accurate compared with single models\u2019 alternatives by combining multiple predictors of different types. The ensemble includes echo-state networks [74], online echo state Gaussian processes [75] and locally weighted projection regression models [76]. The system receives sensory data collected from the robot\u2019s sensors (e.g. cameras, skin, joint encoders). Sensory predictions are then produced using the self-learned forward model implemented by the proposed ensemble method.\nThe kinematic structure learning functional module [77], [78] estimates an articulated kinematic structure of arbitrary objects (including the robot\u2019s body parts, and humans) using local feature point trajectories extracted from the visual input videos of the iCub eye cameras. By combining estimated motion and skeleton information, it generates elaborate and plausible kinematic structures. Based on the estimated articulated kinematic structures [77], we also allow the iCub to anchor two objects\u2019 kinematic structure joints by observing their movements [78]. For this goal, we formulated the problem of finding corresponding kinematic joint matches between two articulated kinematic structures via hypergraph matching, whilst being accurate and plausible under appearance and motion variations. The similarity measures consider structural\ntopology (first order), kinematic correlation (second order) and combinatorial motion (third order) similarities simultaneously. This allows the iCub to infer correspondences between its own body parts (its left arm and its right arm), as well as between its own body and the body of the human as retrieved by the agent detector.\nFinally, the perspective taking functional module [79] enables the robot to reason about the state of the world from the partner\u2019s perspective. This is important in situations where the views of the robot and the human diverge, for example due to objects which are hidden to the human but visible to the robot. Interestingly, it was proposed that there are two separate processes involved in perspective taking depending on the difficulty of the task [80]. We follow this proposal and solve rather simple tasks such as determining whether an object is visible to the human using line of sight tracing. Complex tasks such as visually imagining the world from the human\u2019s point of view are solved by a mental rotation. For this, the point cloud acquired from the RGB-D camera is rotated such that the origin coincides with the head of the human. Furthermore, the mental rotation allows algorithms to reason as if the input data was acquired from an egocentric perspective, which can be used for left/right judgments of object locations. As input, the system receives the object locations; the estimated head pose of the partner; and the point cloud acquired from the RGB-D camera. The system produces an output that characterizes the visibility of each object, the spatial location of each object (left / right of human), as well as a reconstructed view from the human\u2019s perspective. This can then be used when reasoning about the object which is referred to by the human.\n3) Action Selection: The action selection module uses the information from associations to provide context to the behaviors module at the reactive level. This context corresponds to entity names which are provided as parameters to the behaviors module, for instance pointing at a specific object or using the object linguistic label in the parameterized grammars defined at the reactive level. This module also deals with the scheduling of action plans from the contextual layer according to the current state of the system as explained in the next section."}, {"heading": "D. Contextual layer", "text": "The contextual layer deals with higher-level cognitive functions that extend the time horizon of the cognitive agent, such as an episodic memory, goal representation, planning and the formation of a persistent autobiographical memory of the robot interaction with the environment. These functions rely on the unified representations of entities acquired at the adaptive level. The contextual layer consists of three functional modules that are described below: 1) episodic memory, 2) goals and action plans, and 3) autobiographical memory used to generate a narrative structure.\n1) Episodic Memory: The episodic memory relies on advanced functions of the object property collector (OPC) to store and associate information about entities in a uniform format based on the interrogative words \u201cwho\u201d, \u201cwhat\u201d, \u201cwhere\u201d, \u201cwhen\u201d, \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d called an H5W data structure [65].\nIt is used for goal representation and as elements of the autobiographical memory. Formalizing the content and evolution of a scene requires the combination of perceptual, symbolic and rule based reasoning in a single unified framework. Such processes will generate information about who is acting, what they are doing, where and when it happens, and this will give cues about why it is happening. H5W have been argued to be the main questions any conscious being must answer in order to survive in the world [81], [82].\nThe concept of relations is the core of the H5W framework. It links up to five concepts and assigns them with semantic roles to form a solution to the H5W problem. We define a relation as a set of five edges connecting those nodes in a directed and labeled manner. The labels of those edges are chosen so that the relation models a typical sentence from the English grammar of the form: Relation \u2192 Subject Verb [Object] [Place] [Time]. The brackets indicate that the complements are facultative; the minimal relation is therefore composed of two entities representing a subject and a verb.\n2) Goals and action plans: Goals can be provided to the iCub from human speech, and a meaning is extracted by the language reservoir handler, forming the representation of a goal in the goals module. Each goal consequently refers to the appropriately predefined action plan, defined as a state transition graph with states represented by nodes and actions represented by edges of the graph. The action plans module extracts sequences of actions from this graph, with each action being associated with a pre- and a post-condition state. Goals and action plans can be parameterized by the name of a considered entity. For example, if the human asks the iCub to take the cube, this loads an action plan for the goal \u201cTake an object\u201d which consists in two actions: \u201cAsk the human to bring the object closer\u201d and \u201cPull the object\u201d. In this case, each action is associated with a pre- and postcondition state in the form of a region in the space where the object is located. In the action selection module of the adaptive layer, the plan is instantiated toward a specific object according to the knowledge retrieved from the associations module (e.g. allowing to retrieve the current position of the cube). The minimal sequence of actions achieving the goal is then executed according to the perceived current state updated in real-time, repeating each action until its post-condition is met (or giving up after a predefined timeout).\nAlthough quite rigid in its current implementation, in the sense that action plans are predefined instead of being learned from the interaction, this planning ability allows closing the loop of the whole architecture, where drive regulation mechanisms at the reactive layer can now be bypassed through contextual goal-oriented behavior.\n3) Autobiographical Memory: The autobiographical memory (ABM [83], [84], [85]) collects long term information (days, months, years) about interactions. It stores data (e.g. objects locations, human presence) from the beginning (i.e. to extract pre-conditions) to the end (i.e. to extract the effect) of an episode by taking snapshots of the environmental information from the episodic memory. This allows the generation of high level concepts extracted by knowledge-based reasoning. The memory information itself is stored in a SQL database.\nThe ABM is bio-motivated based on the human declarative long term memory situated in the medial temporal lobe, and the distinction between facts and events [83], [84]. In addition, the ABM captures continuous information during an episode (e.g. images from the camera, joints values). This can be used by reasoning modules which focus on the action itself, leading to the production of a procedural memory (e.g. through learning from motor babbling or imitation) [85].\nThe narrative structure learning module builds on the language processing and ABM capabilities. Narrative structure learning occurs in three phases: First the iCub acquires experience in a given scenario. This generates the meaning representation in the ABM. The iCub then formats each story using an IGARF graph (for Initial Goal Action Result Final) according to the different states, actions and results of actions encountered [70]. The human then provides a narration (that is understood using the reservoir system explained in Section III-C) for the scenario. By mapping the events of the narration to the event of the story, the robot can extract the meaning of different discourse functions words (such as because). It can thus automatically generate the corresponding form-meaning mapping that defines the individual grammatical constructions, and their sequencing that defines the narrative construction for a new narrative."}, {"heading": "E. Layer Synergy", "text": "The complete system described in this section therefore integrates several state-of-the-art algorithms for cognitive robotics, and integrates them into a structured cognitive architecture grounded in the principles of the DAC theory. This allows a complex control of the iCub robot proactively interacting with humans trough drive reduction mechanisms in the reactive layer, which allows the bootstrapping of adaptive learning of multimodal representations about entities in the adaptive layer. Those representations form the basis of an episodic memory for goal-oriented behavior through planning in the contextual layer. The life-long interaction of the robot with humans continuously feed an autobiographical memory able to retrieve past experience from request and to express it verbally in a narrative."}, {"heading": "IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "text": "This section validates the cognitive architecture described in the previous section on a real demonstration with an iCub humanoid robot interacting with objects and a human. We first describe the experimental setup, then the autonomous and goal-oriented abilities provided to the robot. Finally we analyze the scenario progression in detail.\nThe code for reproducing this experiment on any iCub robot is available open-source on GitHub at https://github.com/ robotology/wysiwyd. It consists of all modules described in the last section implemented in either C++ or Python, and relies on the YARP middleware [60] for defining their connections and ensuring their parallel execution in real-time."}, {"heading": "A. Experimental setup", "text": "We consider an HRI scenario where the iCub and a human face each other with a table in the middle and objects placed on it. The surface of the table is divided in three distinct areas, as shown in Figure 2:\n1) an area which is only reachable by the iCub (I), 2) an area which is only reachable by the human (H), and 3) an area which is reachable by both agents (S for Shared).\nThe behaviors available to the iCub are the following:\n\u2022 \u201cAcquire missing information about an entity\u201d, which is described in more detail in Section IV-B1. \u2022 \u201cExpress the acquired knowledge\u201d, which is described in more detail in Section IV-B2. \u2022 \u201cMove an object on the table\u201d, either by pushing it from the region I to S or pulling it from the region S to I , \u2022 \u201cAsk the human to move an object\u201d, either asking to push the object from region H to S or asking to pull it from region S to H . \u2022 \u201cShow learned representations on screen\u201d while explaining what is being shown, e.g. displaying the robot kinematic structure learned from a previous arm babbling phase. \u2022 \u201cInteract verbally with the human\u201d while looking at her/him. This is used for replying to some human requests as described in Section IV-C below.\nThese behaviors are implemented in the behaviors module and can be triggered from two distinct pathways as shown in Figure 1. The behaviors for acquiring and expressing knowledge are triggered through the drive reduction mechanisms implemented in the Allostatic Controller (Section III-B). The remaining behaviors are triggered from the Action Selection module (Section III-C), scheduling action sequences from the Goals and Action Plans modules (Section III-D. We describe these two pathways in the two following subsections."}, {"heading": "B. Autonomous behavior", "text": "Two drives for knowledge acquisition and knowledge expression implement the interaction engine of the robot (see Section III-B). They regulate the knowledge acquisition process of the iCub and proactively maintain the interaction with the human. The generated sensorimotor data feeds the adaptive layer of the cognitive architecture to acquire multimodal information about the present entities (see Section III-C). In the current experiment, the entities are objects on the table, body parts (fingers of the iCub), interacting humans, and actions. The acquired multimodal information depends on the considered entity. Object representations are based on visual categorization and stereo-vision based 3D localization performed by the object recognition functional module. Body part representations associate motor and touch events. Agents and actions representations are learned from visual input in the synthetic sensory memory module presented in Section III-C1. Each entity is also associated with a linguistic label learned by self-regulating the two drives detailed below.\n1) Drive to acquire knowledge: This drive maintains a curiosity-driven exploration of the environment by proactively requesting to the human information about the present entities, e.g. the name of an object or the touch of a body part. The drive level decays proportionally to the amount of missing information about the present entities (e.g. the unknown name of an entity). When below a given threshold, it triggers a behavior following a generic pattern of interaction, instantiated according to the nature of the knowledge to be acquired. It begins with a behavior to obtain a joint attention between the human and the robot toward the entity that the robot wants to learn about. After the attention has been attracted toward the desired entity, the iCub asks for the missing information (e.g. the name of an object or of the human, or in case of a body part the name and touch information) and the human replies accordingly. In a third step, this information is passed to the adaptive layer and the knowledge of the robot is updated in consequence.\nEach time the drive level reaches the threshold, an entity is chosen in a pseudo-random way within the set of perceived entities with missing information, with a priority to request the name of a detected unknown human partner. Once a new agent enters the scene, the iCub asks for her/his name, which is stored alongside representations of its face in the synthetic sensory memory module. Similarly, the robot stores all objects it has previously encountered in its episodic memory implemented by the object property collector module. When the chosen entity is an object, the robot asks the human to provide the name of interest while pointing at it. Then, the visual representation of the object computed by the object recognition module is mapped to the name. When the chosen entity is a body part (left hand fingers), the iCub first raises its hand and moves a random finger to attract the attention of\nthe human. Then it asks for the name of that body part. This provides a mapping between the robot\u2019s joint identifier and the joint\u2019s name. This mapping can be later extended to also include tactile information, by asking the human to touch the body part the robot is moving.\nOnce a behavior has been triggered, the drive is reset to its default value and decays again as explained above (the amount of the decay being reduced according to what has been acquired).\n2) Drive to express knowledge: This drive regulates how the iCub expresses the acquired knowledge through synchronized speech, pointing and gaze. It aims at maintaining the interaction with the human by proactively informing her/him about its current state of knowledge. The drive level decays proportionally to the amount of already acquired information about the present entities. When below a given threshold (meaning that a significant amount of information has been acquired), it triggers a behavior alternating gazing toward the human and a known entity, synchronized with speech expressing the knowledge verbally, e.g. \u201cThis is the octopus\u201d, or \u201cI know you, you are Daniel\u201d. Once such a behavior has been triggered, the drive is reset to its default value and decays again as explained above (the amount of the decay changing according to what is learned by satisfying the drive for knowledge acquisition).\nThese two drives allow the robot to balance knowledge acquisition and expression in an autonomous and dynamic way. At the beginning of the interaction, the robot does not know much about the current entities and therefore favors behaviors for knowledge acquisition. By acquiring more and more knowledge, it progressively switches to behaviors for knowledge expression. If new entities are introduced, e.g. a new object or another human, it will switch back to triggering more behaviors for knowledge acquisition and so on."}, {"heading": "C. Goal-oriented behavior", "text": "The representations acquired by satisfying the drives above allow a more complex interaction through goal-oriented behavior managed by the contextual layer (see Figure 1 and Section III-D). Goals can be provided to the iCub from human speech and a meaning is extracted by the language reservoir handler, forming the representation of a goal in the goals module. Each goal is associated with an action plan on the form of a sequence of actions together with their pre- and postconditions in the action plans module. The action selection module takes care of the execution of the plan according to the associations known to the robots, triggering the appropriate behaviors according to its current perception of the scene updated in real time. Goal achievement bypasses the reactive behavior described in the previous subsection by freezing all the drive levels during the execution of the plan. The available goals are described below.\n1) Give or take an object: These goals are generated from a human verbal request, e.g. \u201cGive me the octopus\u201d or \u201cTake the cube\u201d. Here, the goal is represented as a region on the table, either the human area H (for the \u201cGive\u201d goal) or the iCub area I (for the \u201cTake\u201d goal), where the mentioned\nobject should be placed. Action plans are generated from the state-transition graph shown in Figure 3. State perception is updated in real-time according to the perceived location of the object computed through stereo-vision in the object recognition module.\n2) Point to an object: This goal is generated through a verbal request, e.g. \u201cPoint to the octopus\u201d. If the mentioned object is not known to the iCub, it will first ask the human to point to it in order to learn the new association between the name and the object visual representation. Once the name is known, or if it was already known, the iCub will point to the object.\n3) Say the name of a recognized action: This goal is generated through a verbal request, e.g. \u201cHow do you call this action?\u201d formulated just after the human has performed an action on an object. Four actions can be recognized: \u201cpush\u201d, \u201cpull\u201d, \u201clift\u201d, \u201cdrop\u201d, \u201cwave\u201d, and \u201cpoint\u201d. The reply from the iCub provides the name of the action and the object as well as the hand used by the human, e.g. \u201cYou pushed the cube with your left hand\u201d. The action classification is realized by the synthetic sensory memory module.\n4) Tell what happened during a past interaction with a human: This goal is generated through a verbal request, e.g. \u201cWhat have you done the other day?\u201d. Based on its past interactions with the environment and with humans, the iCub has stored all the relevant information in its autobiographical memory (see Section III-D), including its own drives, motivations and actions, as well of the actions of the human (both, spoken and physically enacted). The narrative handler functional module is able to generate a narrative discourse from the content of the autobiographical memory and to generate an action plan on the form of a sequence of sentences. The human can request more detailed information about an event using sentences like \u201cWhat happened next?\u201d or \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d, this later question being answered according to the stored drive levels and goal states of the considered events. The robot can also learn a set of questions that it can re-use in the context of another story. Figure 4 shows an example of a generated narrative.\n5) Show the learned kinematic structure: As for the previous goals, this goal is generated through verbal requests. When asked \u201cWhat have you learned from your arm babbling\u201d, the iCub refers the human to look at the screen where the kinematic structures of its arms are displayed. Also lines which connect nodes of the kinematic structures indicate the correspondences which the iCub has found between its left and right arm. Similarly, the iCub displays the correspondences\nfrom one sentence to the other, the open class words (OCW) which correspond to the meaningful words in terms of vocabulary of the sentence, and the closed class words (CCW) which have a grammatical function in the sentence (see [70]).\nwhich it has found between one of its arms and the body of the human (see Figure 5)."}, {"heading": "D. Scenario Progression", "text": "We propose to evaluate our system in a mixed-initiative scenario, where the iCub behaves autonomously as described in Section IV-B, and so does the human. The human can interrupt the robot behavior by formulating verbal requests as described in Section IV-C. The scenario can follow various paths according to the interaction between the iCub\u2019s internal drive dynamics, its perception of the environment and the behavior of the human.\nWe provide a series of videos of live interactions in a lab environment at http://clement-moulin-frier.github.io/dac-h3/.\nHere, we describe one particular instance of the scenario. Figure 6 shows the corresponding drive dynamics and humanrobot interactions, and Figure 1 shows the connections between the modules of the cognitive architecture. Each of the numbered items below is refers to its corresponding number in Figure 6.\n1) At the beginning of the interaction, the iCub does not know much information about the current scene. In the sensations module, the agent detector detects the presence of a human and extracts its skeleton. The object recognition module performs blob detection for extracting objects on the table from the visual input of the eye cameras and trains a classifier to categorize them. The 3D locations of the present objects are also computed in object recognition through stereo vision. This form a first incomplete representation of the scene in the episodic memory where the object property collector registers the location and type of each detected entity (here objects and an agent). It also contain slots for unknown body parts of the iCub, here the five fingers of its right hand. 2) The presence of a large amount of missing information (presence of unknown objects, human and body parts) in the sensations module makes the drive for knowledge acquisition decaying rapidly in the allostatic controller and the drive for knowledge expression is kept constant (since there is no knowledge to express yet). 3) When this drive level is below threshold, it triggers the associated behavior (behaviors module) for acquiring information about an entity. The choice of the unknown entity is pseudo-random, with priority for requesting the name of an unknown human. This makes the robot look at the human. The visual input is passed to the perceptions module where the synthetic sensory memory segments the face from the background and attempts to recognize it from previously seen faces. It does not recognize the face and asks \u201cI do not know you, who are you?\u201d. The human replies, e.g., \u201cI am Daniel\u201d. The level of the drive is reset to its default value and both drives are frozen during the behavior execution. 4) The perceived speech is analyzed by the language reservoir handler in perceptions to extract the name \u201cDaniel\u201d and is associated with the face representation in the associations module. Thus, the next time the iCub will interact with this person, it will directly recognize him and not ask for his name. 5) Once this interaction is achieved, the drives continue to decay. Since the iCub has just acquired more information, the decay of the drive for knowledge acquisition is slower and the one for knowledge expression is increased. Still, the drive for knowledge acquisition reaches the threshold first. The behavior for acquiring information is therefore triggered again. This time, the random choice of an unknown entity makes the robot point to an object and ask \u201cWhat is this object?\u201d. The human replies e.g. \u201cThis is the cube\u201d. The language reservoir handler extracts the name of the object from the reply and the associations module associates it with the visual representation of the pointed object from object recognition. Now the cube can later be referred by its name. 6) The drives continues to decay. This time, the drive for knowledge expression reaches the threshold first. This triggers the behavior for expressing the acquired knowledge. A known entity is chosen, here the cube, which is pointed while saying \u201cThis is a cube\u201d.\n7) The human asks \u201cTake the cube\u201d. A meaning is extracted by the language reservoir handler in perceptions and forms the representation of a goal to achieve in the goal module (here the desired location of the object, i.e. the region of the iCub I for the goal \u201ctake\u201d, see Figure 3). An action plan is built in action plans with the sequence of two actions \u201cAsk the human to push the object\u201d then \u201cPull the object\u201d, together with their preand post-conditions in term of states (I , S or H). The action selection module takes care of the realization of the plan. First, it instantiates the action plan toward the considered object, here the cube, through its connection with associations. Then, it executes each action until its associated post-condition is met (repeating it three times before giving up). Since the cube is in the human area H , the iCub first triggers the behavior for interacting verbally with the human, asking \u201cCan you please bring the cube closer to the shared area?\u201d. The human pushes the cube to the shared area S and the state transition is noticed by the robot thanks to the real-time object localization performed in object recognition. Then the robot triggers a motor action to pull the cube. Once the goal is achieved (i.e. the cube is in I), the drive levels which were frozen during this interaction continue to decay. 8) The drive for knowledge acquisition reaches the threshold first. The associated behavior now chooses to acquire the name of a body part. The robot triggers the behavior for raising its hand and moving a random unknown body part, here the middle finger. It looks at the human and asks \u201cHow do you call this part of my body?\u201d. The name of the body part is extracted from the human\u2019s reply and is associated with the joint that was moved in associations. The interaction continues following the dynamics of the drives and interrupted by the requests from the human. Once all available information about the present entities is acquired, the drive for knowledge acquisition stops to decay. However,\nthe robot still maintains the interaction through its drive for knowledge expression and the human can still formulate requests for goal-oriented behavior. When new entities are introduced, e.g. an unknown object or another human entering in the scene, the drive for knowledge acquisition decays again and the process continues."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS", "text": "This paper has introduced DAC-h3, a proactive robot cognitive architecture to acquire and express knowledge about the world and the self. The architecture is based on the Distributed Adaptive Control (DAC) theory of the brain and mind, which provides a biologically grounded framework for organizing various functional modules into a coherent cognitive architecture. Those modules implement state-of-the-art algorithms modeling various cognitive functions for autonomous selfregulation, whole-body motor control, multimodal perception, knowledge representation, natural language processing, and goal-oriented behavior. They are all implemented using the YARP robotic middleware on the iCub robot, ensuring their parallel execution in real time and providing synchronous and asynchronous communication protocols among modules.\nThe main contribution of this paper is not about the modeling of the specific functional modules, which already have been published (see Section III), but rather about the integration of a heterogeneous collection of modules into a coherent and operational cognitive architecture. For this aim, the DACh3 architecture is organized as a layered control structure with tight coupling within and between layers (Figure 1 and Section III): the somatic, reactive, adaptive, and contextual layers. Across these layers, a columnar organization exists that deals with the processing of states of the world or exteroception, the self or interoception and action. Two main control loops generate the behavior of the robot. First, a reactive-adaptive control loop ensures autonomy and proactivity through the self-regulation of internal drives for knowledge acquisition and expression. It allows the robot to proactively manage its own knowledge acquisition process and to maintain the interaction with a human partner, while associating multimodal information about entities with their linguistic labels. Second, an adaptive-contextual control loop allows the robot to satisfy human requests, triggering goal-oriented behavior relying on the acquired knowledge. Those goal-oriented behaviors are related to action planning for object passing, pointing, action recognition, narrative expression and kinematic structure learning demonstration.\nWe have implemented the entire DAC-h3 architecture and presented a HRI scenario where an iCub humanoid robot interacts with objects and a human to acquire information about the present objects and agents as well as its own body parts. We have analyzed a typical interaction in detail, showing how DAC-h3 is able to dynamically balance the knowledge acquisition and expression processes according to the properties of the environment, and to deal with a mixed initiative scenario where both the robot and the human are behaving autonomously. In a series of video recordings, we show the ability of DAC-h3 to adapt to different situations and environments.\nThe current work has the following limitations. First, some of the available abilities deserve to be better integrated into the HRI scenario. For example, this is the case for the kinematic structure learning process which is currently executed in a separated learning phase instead of being fully integrated within the interaction scenario. Similarly, the narrative can only be generated from specific chunks of the robot\u2019s history as recorded in the autobiographical memory. Second, in this paper we do not provide a statistical analysis of the HRI experiments. The reason is that we focus on the description of the entire architecture and on their theoretical principles. Statistical analysis will allow to better demonstrate the utility of some of these principles, for example how proactivity helps solving the referential indeterminacy problem, as well as the effect of the robot\u2019s autonomy on the acceptability of the system by naive users. Third, although DAC-h3 is able to solve parts of the Symbol Grounding Problem (SGP), it still presupposes a symbolic concept of entity which is given a priori to the system. Therefore, our contribution is more about the ability to proactively acquire multimodal information about these entities, and linking them to linguistic labels that can be reused to express complex goal-oriented behavior later on.\nWe are currently extending the proposed architecture in the following ways. First, we are better integrating some of the available abilities within the interaction scenario as mentioned above. This will allow to start the knowledge acquisition process from scratch in a fully autonomous way. Second, we are considering to use more biologically plausible models for some of the existing modules, namely the action planning and action selection modules. These are currently algorithmic implementations using predefined action plans. We want to replace it with an existing model of rule learning grounded in the neurobiology of the prefrontal cortex which is able to learn optimal action policies from experience to maximize long-term reward [?]. An interesting feature of this model for solving the SGP is that it relies on neural memory-units encoding sensorimotor contingencies with causal relationships learned through adaptive connections between them. Such sensorimotor contingencies, adaptively learned from experience, could provide the basis of emerging symbols without relying on a pre-existing concept of entity as in the current version of the architecture. Third, we are also integrating more low-level reactive control abilities through an acquired notion of a peripersonal space [?], where the robot will be able to optimize its own action primitives to maintain safety distances with aversive objects (e.g. a spider) in real time while executing reaching actions toward other objects. Finally, we are working on a self-exploration process to autonomously discover the area which is reachable by the robot, and subsequently employing this self-model and applying it to the human partner to estimate his/her reachability."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "text": "The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council under the European Union\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013) / ERC Grant Agreement n.

The framework, based on a biologically-grounded theory of the brain and mind, integrates a reactive interaction engine, a number of state-of-the art perceptual and motor learning algorithms, as well as planning abilities and an autobiographical memory. The architecture as a whole drives the robot behavior to solve the symbol grounding problem, acquire language capabilities, execute goal-oriented behavior, and express a verbal narrative of its own experience in the world. We validate our approach in a human-robot interaction experiment with the iCub humanoid robot, showing that the proposed cognitive architecture can be applied in real time within a realistic scenario.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
