Dung [Dung, 1995] states that formal argumentation \u201ccaptures naturally the way humans argue to justify their solutions to many social problems.\u201d This is one of the most common claims used to support research in formal argumentation. More recently there have been a number of empirical studies to investigate this claim [Rahwan and Reed, 2009, Cerutti et al., 2014, Rosenfeld and Kraus, 2016a, Rosenfeld and Kraus, 2016b]. The results, however, have been far from conclusive.\nThe use of graphical models to represent arguments is the most common approach used in the formal argumentation community to capture argument structures. This has been successfully applied in a number of real world situations: Laronge [Laronge, 2012]\nar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n04 03\n3v 1\n[ cs\n(an American barrister and researcher), for example, describes how he used argumentation graphs during trials. Despite this, our claim is that to produce and to consume a graphical representation of a structure of arguments there is need for significant levels of training.\nInstead of training users on another (graphical) language for representing argument structures, we can leverage our societal model, through which we are trained in reading and writing; that is, using natural language. We claim that natural language representations of formal argumentation are the way forward to develop formal models that capture human argumentation. In this paper we investigate one aspect of natural language interfaces to formal argumentation: moving from formal arguments to natural language text by exploiting Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems. We ground our investigation on an existing example (Section 2) from collaboration between the BBC and the Dundee argumentation group [Lawrence et al., 2012], namely an excerpt of the BBC Radio 4 Moral Maze programme from 22nd June 2012. In this way the reader can always relate to the original piece of text from where our investigation started. The excerpt has been already formalised into an argument network (i.e. a graph linking together different pieces of information together to display the web of arguments exchanged). In Figure 1 and in Section 3 we review all the necessary elements for our investigation: the notion of argumentation schemes; how to represent argument networks in the Argument Interchange Format (AIF); a (simple) approach to structured argumentation to build arguments and approximate arguments from an AIF argument network; Dung\u2019s theory of argumentation; and basic elements of NLG.\nIn NLG one of the most difficult tasks is to determine the communicative goal; i.e. deciding what we would like to communicate. Therefore, Section 4 is entirely dedicated to investigating relevant communicative goals in the context of formal argumentation.\nThe result we wish to achieve in this paper is a blueprint that outlines the complex research questions and their dense interconnections that our community needs to address in order to identify models that naturally capture human argumentation."}, {"heading": "2 Running Example", "text": "On 22nd June 2012, in the middle of the European debt crisis, the Moral Maze program on BBC Radio 4 addressed the topic of individual and national debt.

If you want the economy to run smoothly, you have to incentivise certain types of behaviour. [T4] So, for example in South Korea, in terms of how South Korean grew, it did incentivise saving, at certain times, by certain economic policies [T5]. On the other hand, I think what people don\u2019t realise, or only half realise, is the fact that we have actually written off massive amounts of debt [T6].

Each scheme has a set of critical questions that represents standard ways of critically probing into an argument to find aspects of it that are open to criticism.\nFor instance, in the dialogue reported in Section 2, part of Nick\u2019s position can be mapped into an argument from example that has the following structure:\nPremise: In this particular case, individual a has property F and also property G. Conclusion: Therefore, generally, if x has property F, the it also has property G.\nOne of the critical questions here is: \u201cIs the proposition claimed in the premise in fact true?\u201d"}, {"heading": "3.2 Representing an Argument Network", "text": "The Argument Interchange Format (AIF) [Chesnevar et al., 2006, Rahwan and Reed, 2009] is the current proposal for a standard notation for argument structures.

The user model is a characterisation of the intended audience, and the discourse history is a model of what has been said so far.\nAn NLG system divides processing into a pipeline [Reiter and Dale, 2006] composed of the three stages described in Table 1. First it determines the content and structure of a document (document planning); then it looks at syntactic structures and choices of words that needs to be used to communicate the content chosen in the document planning (microplanning). Finally, it maps the output of the microplanner into text (realisation).\nEach stage includes tasks that can be primary concerned with either content or structure. Document planning requires content determination \u2014 deciding what information should be communicated in the output document \u2014 and document structuring \u2014 how to order the information to be conveyed.\nMicroplanning requires (1) lexicalisation \u2014 deciding what syntactic constructions our NLG system should use; (2) referring expression generation \u2014 how to relate with entities; and (3) aggregation \u2014 how to map the structures created by the document planning onto linguistic structures such as sentences and paragraphs.\nDocument planning and microplanning are the most strategic and complex modules in this pipeline. They focus on identifying the communicative goal and how it relates to the user model, thus producing the blueprint of the document that will be generated.\nIt is the responsibility of the document planning module, in particular of the document structuring task, to consider the rhetorical relations (or discourse relations) that hold between messages or groups of messages. For instance, Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) [Mann and Thompson, 1988] stresses the idea that the coherency of a text depends on the relationships between pairs of text spans (an uninterrupted linear interval of text) a nucleus and a satellite. In [Mann and Thompson, 1988] a variety of relationships are provided, but for the purpose of this work, we focus on:\nEvidence The nucleus contains a claim, while the satellite(s) contain(s) evidence supporting such a claim.\nJustify The nucleus contains a claim, while the satellite(s) contain(s) justification for such a claim.\nAntithesis Nucleus and satellite are in contrast.\nFinally, once the more strategical tasks are performed, there is need for linguistic realisation \u2014 from abstract representations of sentences to actual text \u2014 and structure realisation \u2014 converting abstract structures such as paragraphs and sections into the mark-up symbols chosen for the document. The realisation module is the most algorithmic in this pipeline, and there are already several implementations for supporting it, for instance SimpleNLG [Gatt and Reiter, 2009].\nIn the next section we highlight the cases of document planning and microplanning we believe are most interesting from an argumentation perspective."}, {"heading": "4 Generating Natural Language Interfaces to Formal Argumentation", "text": "Let us now return to our running example to illustrate four relevant communicative goals. For the moment we are not making any assumptions about the user model, and we will assume no pre-existing discourse history.

Presenting a single argument or an approximate argument;\n2. Presenting an entire argument network;\n3. Explaining the acceptability status of a single argument or an approximate argument; and\n4. Explaining the extensions, given some semantics.\nIn the following, we discuss elements of content determination for each of these goals; i.e. deciding what messages should be included in the document to be generated. Examples will be provided based on our running example. In parts, the generated texts will sound a little awkward because we deliberately chose not to modify the content of the arguments. We will elaborate on this in Section 5."}, {"heading": "4.1 Presenting a Simple or an Approximate Argument", "text": "Simple and approximate arguments are composed of premises and a claim. There are two main strategies traditionally adopted to represent such a construct:\n\u2022 forward writing, from premises to claim;\n\u2022 backward writing,1 from claim to premises.\nLet us consider the argument b \u201c xt[T4], [T4] \u00d1 [T3]u, [T3]y. In the case of forward writing, we can write something like:\nIf you want the economy to run smoothly, you have to incentivise certain type of behaviour.

[T3] Indeed If you want the economy to run smoothly, you have to incentivise certain type of behaviour. [T4]\nMore interesting is the case of considering an approximate argument. Assuming that the communicative goal here is not to confuse the reader, it is probably reasonable not to include irrelevant elements in the presentation. Relevance theory may be seen as an attempt to analyse an essential feature of most human communication: the expression and recognition of intentions [Grice, 1989, Sperber and Wilson, 2005].\nFor instance, the First or Cognitive Principle of Relevance proposed by Sperber and Wilson [Sperber and Wilson, 1995, Sperber and Wilson, 2005] states: Human cognition tends to be geared to the maximisation of relevance. Therefore, it would be evidence of poor judgment to expand the argument by considering irrelevant elements. Unfortunately, defining the concept of relevance in formal argumentation is a nontrivial task [van Eemeren, F and Grootendorst, 2014, Paglieri and Castelfranchi, 2014]. To take a reasonable starting point, let us adapt the definition of relevant evidence from the Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence2 to our context. Therefore, an approximate argument is relevant for an argument if:\n1. Its premises have any tendency to make the argument\u2019s conclusion more or less probable than it would be without them; and\n2. It provides additional information that might advance the debate.\nGiven this (loose) definition of relevance, we could argue that the approximate argument b1 \u201c xt[T5], [T5] \u00d1 [T4], [T4] \u00d1 [T3]u, [T3]y is relevant for b. Similarly as before, there are different possibilities to write such a chain of inferences. In addition, it raises questions related to microplanning: perhaps, we desire to merge together different pieces such as in the following example using backward writing style.\n1Often also named assert-justify. 2https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_401 (on 13/05/2017)\nIn some ways you need that discipline, don\u2019t you, to be a saver, to think, \u201cI won\u2019t get into debt\u201d?. [T3] Indeed If you want the economy to run smoothly, you have to incen-\ntivise certain type of behaviour. [T4] , e.g. in South Korea, in terms of how South Korean grew, it did incentivise saving, at certain times, by certain economic policies [T5]\n[T4] and [T5] are merged by a comma and e.g. . In this way, we highlight the Evidence relation and identify the connection as an argument from example instead of forming two independent sentences, which is an aspect traditionally related to microplanning.\nFinally, if we have knowledge that an inference rule fulfils an argumentation scheme, then we can also map the elements of an argument into such a scheme. For instance, argument b is classified as an argument by established rule, that is represented by the following scheme:\nMajor Premise: If carrying out types of actions including the state of affairs A is the established rule for x, then (unless the case is an exception), x must carry out A.\nMinor Premise: Carrying out types of actions including state of affairs A is the established rule for a.\nConclusion: Therefore a must carry out A. It is interesting to note that the minor premise is left implicit in the formalisation of our example, and it might be an element that should be highlighted to the user. How to report an implicit premise may depend on the communicative goal. For example, if the system is intended for users to improve and make their arguments more explicit we may generate the text:\nIn some ways you need that discipline, don\u2019t you, to be a saver, to think, \u201cI won\u2019t get into debt\u201d?. [T3] Indeed If you want the economy to run smoothly, you have to incentivise certain type of behaviour. [T4] although we have no evidence that this is the established rule.\nIn this case, the fact that there is a lack of the minor premise is added to the generated text. On the other hand, if the system is intended to report an analysis of a conversation, we need to take into account that the premise is implicit as it may be already known by the participants. Hence, the system could assume that the premise holds, and generate an explicit sentence and we assume that this is the established rule. Further research is, however, needed in understanding how to generate text in case of unstated premises (e.g., in case of enthymemes[Walton et al., 2008, Black and Hunter, 2012]). With similar considerations, we could also include critical questions that have either already been answered, or that, if answered, could strengthen the argument."}, {"heading": "4.2 Presenting an Argument Network", "text": "One of the strengths of formal argumentation is its ability to handle conflicts. In the previous section we focused on how to represent a single argument. However, even in our small running example, we can note that (1) there are more than one argument; and (2) there are conflicts among them (Figures 1 and 2).\nThe simplest strategy for representing an argument network is just to enumerate all the arguments and to list the conflicts among them, eventually linking that with critical questions if the information is available (e.g. This counterargument answers\nthe critical question that states . . . ). However, we argue that there is a better approach, motivated by the need to satisfy Grice\u2019s maxim of relation and relevance [Grice, 1975]; i.e. that in a conversation one needs to be relevant and say things that are pertinent to the discussion. Let us consider Figure 3 that depicts the \u0393m argumentation framework (cf. Fig. 2) annotated with a second, bipolar-inspired [Amgoud et al., 2008],3 binary relation between arguments. Such a relation is grounded in the original argument network, Figure 1.\nOnce such an annotated graph is obtained, a line of reasoning annotated together (e.g. xa,b, cy in Figure 3) could be merged together in order to provide a single approximate argument. Once all the lines of reasoning annotated together are identified and merged, then we need a strategy to order their presentation; e.g. ordering by length of each line of reasoning versus ordering by the number of attacks received. We also need appropriate signals for antithesis relations need to be used. For instance:\nif you want the moral hazard, instead of kind of just going on about the bankers, is there not a danger that if we just said we\u2019d write off debt, that it actually isn\u2019t very helpful for our side, for ordinary people, to actually have that? [T1] Indeed There\u2019s no discipline there [T2] and In some ways you need that discipline, don\u2019t you, to be a saver, to think, \u201cI won\u2019t get into debt\u201d?. [T3] Indeed If you want the economy to run smoothly, you have to incentivise certain type of behaviour. [T4] , e.g. in South Korea, in terms of how South Korean grew, it did incentivise saving, at certain times, by certain economic policies [T5] However, people don\u2019t\n3By bipolar-inspired we intend that such a relation does not represent conflicts. At the same time, however, we are not in the position to argue that it would be a relationship of support.\nc d\nb\nPRO\nCON\nPRO"}, {"heading": "4.3 Explaining the Acceptability Status of a Single Argument or an Approximate Argument", "text": "Two of the traditional decision problems in abstract argumentation [Dunne and Wooldridge, 2009] are checking whether an argument is credulously or skeptically accepted (or not). An interested user might select one of the arguments (or one of the propositions in the argument network) and ask whether or not it is credulously or skeptically accepted.\nTo answer such a query, we can exploit research in proof theory and argument games [Modgil and Caminada, 2009]. For instance, to prove that c (in Figure 2) is credulously accepted according to preferred semantics, we can (1) compute the extensions; and (2) compute the dispute tree [Modgil and Caminada, 2009] needed to prove it. The dispute tree is depicted in Figure 4 which suggests that only the argument network comprising c, d, and b needs to be considered."}, {"heading": "4.4 Explaining Extensions", "text": "Explaining multiple extensions is analogous to present different argumentation (sub-)networks that are linked together by attacks. Therefore, the solution for this communication goal builds upon the procedures envisaged in Sections 4.2 and 4.3.\nIt is worth mentioning that a possible way to identify the attack connections between those extensions is to consider a set of arguments belonging to a set of issues S P Eissuesp\u0393q such that |S| \u201c |E\u03c3p\u0393q| for the chosen \u03c3 semantics.\n4 Those arguments could nicely provide foci of attention: for instance, tb,du P Eissuesp\u0393mq. Therefore, the text presented in Section 4.2 could be adapted in a straightforward manner to communicate the existence of two preferred extensions that gravitate around the issue tb,du.\n4Assuming that the semantics can be related to the notion of a complete labelling (Def. 4)."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper have we provided a blueprint for a complex set of research questions that arise when considering how to generate natural language representations of formal argumentation structures.\nFirst of all, as already noted at the beginning of Section 4, we assume neither a model of the user, nor pre-existing contexts that need to be referenced in the piece of text generated. These elements will need to be addressed in future research.\nMoreover some pieces of generated text sound quite awkward. To address such an issue, each piece of information inserted in an argument network should represent a single text-agnostic normal form proposition. In this way, we could compose them in a way in a meaningful way. This is clearly a constraint that might be unnatural if an untrained user tries to generate an argument network, and this raises an interesting research question concerning how to enable untrained users to formalise their lines of reasoning.\nIt is worth noting that the research questions highlighted in this paper have been grounded on a piece of argumentation formalised from a discussion between humans. We claim neither that our list is exhaustive nor that it is applicable to all possible argument networks. For instance, providing a natural language interface to an argument network built by an expert might lead to different, unforeseen, communicative goals. For instance, related research enabling the scrutiny of autonomous systems by allowing agents to generate plans through argument and dialogue [Tintarev et al., 2013] had the specific communication goal of justifying the purpose of each step within a plan.\nMoreover we support the effort of extending AIF to include additional information: for instance, the AIFdb [Lawrence et al., 2012] project extends the AIF model to include schemes: of rephrasing; of locution describing communicative intentions which speakers use to introduce propositional contents; and of interaction or protocol describing relations between locutions. Dealing with those pieces of information raise further research questions. Indeed, as we saw in Section 3.3, arguments a, b, and c form a conflict-free set, and in Section 4 we often considered them altogether in an approximate argument. However, while argument c was put forward by Claire Fox in the original dialogue (Section 2), arguments a and b belong to Nick Dearden. The question here is how to include the sources of those arguments in the generated natural language text. In the use of argumentation to support reasoning and intelligence analysis [Toniolo et al., 2015], sources are also important, but this is only one aspect of the provenance of an argument that could, in general, be considered.\nFinally, we will investigate the potential of applying NLG to existing systems using formal argumentation in real-world applications, such as CISpaces [Toniolo et al., 2015] \u2014 a system for collaborative intelligence analysis \u2014 and ArgMed [Hunter and Williams, 2012, Williams et al., 2015] \u2014 a system for reasoning about the results of clinical trials."}], "references": [{"title": "On bipolarity in argumentation frameworks", "author": ["Amgoud et al", "L. 2008] Amgoud", "C.
