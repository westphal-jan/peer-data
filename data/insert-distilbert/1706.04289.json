Introduction", "text": "Relational learning from network data, particularly with probabilistic methods, has gained a wide range of applications such as social network analysis (Xiang et al., 2010), recommender systems (Gopalan et al., 2014b), knowledge graph completion (Hu et al., 2016b), and bioinformatics (Huopaniemi et al., 2010). Generally speaking, the goal of relational learning is to discover and analyse latent clusters of entities (i.e., community detection), and predict missing links (i.e., link prediction).\nThe standard approach for modelling relational data is latent factor analysis via matrix factorisation and its variations. Among the existing approaches, Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) and the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) are prominent foundational methods. NMF is usually used to model relationships between two sets of entities such as users and movies in collaborative filtering (Mnih & Salakhutdinov, 2008). While developed independently, SBM (Wang & Wong, 1987; Nowicki & Snijders, 2001) can be viewed as an extension of NMF that introduces\n1Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Australia.

There have been many Bayesian extensions of these two methods, relaxing the assumptions and/or introducing extra components, such as the Infinite Relational Model (IRM) (Kemp et al., 2006), the mixture membership stochastic block model (MMSB) (Airoldi et al., 2008), and the non-parametric latent feature models (NLFM) (Miller et al., 2009). Poisson Factorisation (PF) (Dunson & Herring, 2005; Zhou et al., 2012), is a popular version of NMF which models count data with convenient statistical properties (Gopalan et al., 2014b; 2015). Combining the ideas of PF and SBM, the infinite Edge Partition Model (EPM) (Zhou, 2015) and its extensions (Hu et al., 2016b) have proven successful for relational networks.\nWhen a network has less data, relational learning becomes more difficult. One extreme case is the cold-start problem (Lin et al., 2013; Sedhain et al., 2014; Zhang & Wang, 2015), where a node has no observed links, making suggestion of links for that node even more challenging. In such cases, it is natural to appeal to side information such as node attributes or features. For instance, papers in citation networks are often associated with categories and authors, and users in Facebook or Twitter are often asked to provide information such as age, gender and interests. It is reasonable to assume that nodes having similar attributes are more likely to relate to each other (i.e., homophily, Nickel et al., 2016). Thus, node attributes serve as important complementary information to relational data.\nThere are few Bayesian probabilistic relational models that are able to leverage side information. For example, NLFM uses a linear regression model to transform the features of each node into a single number, which contributes to link probabilities. However, side information in NLFM cannot directly influence the latent factors, which gives little support for community detection. As an extension of MMSB, the Non-parametric Meta-data Dependent Relational (NMDR) model (Kim et al., 2012) incorporates attributes into the mixed-membership distribution of each node with the logistic-normal transform, which results in non-conjugacy for inference. Fan et al. (2016) further developed this idea in the Node information Involved Mixture Membership model (niMM), where side information is integrated in a conjugate way. Although these models demonstrate improvement using side information, they ar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n04 28\n9v 1\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n1 4\nJu n\n20 17\nscale quadratically in the number of nodes and the incorporation of side information is often complicated.\nSeveral recent methods (Gopalan et al., 2014a; Acharya et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2016a) extend PF with side information using the additivity of the Poisson and gamma distributions/processes. With improved scalability, the Structural Side Information Poisson Factorisation (SSI-PF) (Hu et al., 2016a) models directed unweighted networks with node labels, such as citation networks with papers labelled with one of several categories. However, its performance remains untested when a node has multiple attributes. Moreover, undirected networks are not handled by SSI-PF.\nIn this paper we present the Node Attribute Relational Model (NARM)1, a fully Bayesian approach that models large, sparse, and unweighted relational networks with arbitrary node attributes encoded in binary form. It works with Poisson gamma relational models to incorporate side information. Specifically, we propose the Symmetric NARM (Sym-NARM) for undirected networks, an extension of EPM (Zhou, 2015) and the Asymmetric NARM (Asym-NARM) for directed networks, an extension of PF (Zhou et al., 2012). The proposed models have several key properties: (1) Effectively modelling node attributes: the proposed models are able to achieve improved link prediction performance, especially where training data are limited. (2) Fully Bayesian and conjugate: the inference is done by efficient, closed-form Gibbs sampling which scales linearly in the number of observed links and takes advantage of the sparsity of node attributes. It makes our models scalable for large but sparse relational networks with large sets of node attributes. (3) Flexibility: the proposed models work on directed and undirected relational networks with flat and hierarchical node attributes."}, {"heading": "2. The Node Attribute Relational Model", "text": "Here we focus on modelling unweighted networks that can be either directed (i.e., the relationship is asymmetric) or undirected. Assume a relational network with N nodes is stored in a binary adjacency matrix Y \u2208 {0, 1}N\u00d7N where yi,j = 1 indicates the presence of a link between nodes i and j. If the relationship described in the network is symmetric, then yi,j = yj,i, and if asymmetric, possibly yi,j 6= yj,i. Node attributes are encoded in a binary matrix F \u2208 {0, 1}N\u00d7L, where L is the total number of attributes. Attribute fi,l = 1 indicates attribute l is active with node i and vice versa. Although our models incorporate binary attributes, categorical attributes and real-valued attributes can be converted into binary values with proper transformations (Kim et al., 2012; Fan et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2016a).\n1Code available at https://github.com/ ethanhezhao/NARM/"}, {"heading": "2.1. The Symmetric Node Attribute Relational Model", "text": "Sym-NARM works with undirected networks. Its generative process is shown in Figure 1. Instead of modelling the binary matrix Y directly, it applies the Bernoulli-Poisson link (BPL) function (Zhou, 2015) using an underlying latent count matrix X. One first draws a latent count xi,j from the Poisson distribution and then thresholds it at 1 to generate a binary value yi,j . This is shown in Eqs. (1)- (3). Analysed in (Zhou, 2015; Hu et al., 2016b;a), BPL has the appealing property that if yi,j = 0, then xi,j = 0 with probability one. Thus, only non-zeros in Y need to be sampled, giving huge computational savings for large sparse networks, illustrated in Section 3 and Section 5.4.\nThe latent matrix X is further factorised into K latent factors with a non-negative bilinear model: X \u223c Poi(\u03a6\u039b\u03a6T ) where \u03a6 \u2208 RN\u00d7K+ and \u039b \u2208 RK\u00d7K+ . \u03a6 is referred to as the node factor loading matrix where \u03c6i,k models the strength of the connection between node i and latent factor k. As in SBM, the correlations of the latent factors are modelled in a symmetric matrix \u039b, referred to as the block matrix. Following (Zhou, 2015), we draw \u039b from a hierarchical relational gamma process (implemented with truncation as a vector of gamma variables) , shown in Eqs. (8) and (9).\nOne appealing aspect of our model is the incorporation of node attributes on the prior of \u03c6i,k (i.e., gi,k). Shown in Eq. (5), gi,k is constructed with a log linear combination of fi,l. hl,k is referred to as the kth attribute factor loading of attribute l, which influences gi,k iff attribute l is active with node i (i.e., fi,l = 1). bk acts as an attribute-free bias for each latent factor k. hl,k and bk are gamma distributed with mean 1, hence if attribute l does not contribute to latent factor k or is less useful, hl,k is expected to be near 1 and to have little influence on gi,k. The hyper-parameter \u00b50 controls the variation of hl,k.\nThe intuition of our model is: if two nodes have more common attributes, their gamma shape parameters will be more similar, with similar node factor loadings, resulting in a larger probability that they relate to each other. Moreover, instead of incorporating the node attributes directly into the node factor loadings, Sym-NARM uses them as the prior information using Eq. (4), which results in a principled way of balancing the side information and the network data. In addition, different attributes can contribute differently to the latent factors. For example, the gender of an author may be much less important to co-authorship with others than the research fields. This is controlled by the attribute factor loading hl,k in our model."}, {"heading": "2.2. The Asymmetric Node Attribute Relational Model", "text": "Extending the Beta Gamma Gamma Poisson factorisation (BGGPF) (Zhou et al., 2012), Asym-NARM works on di-\nrected relational networks with node attributes incorporated in a similar way to Sym-NARM. Figure 2 shows its generative process. Here the latent count matrix X is factorised as X \u223c Poi(\u03a6\u0398), where \u03a6 \u2208 RN\u00d7K+ and \u0398 \u2208 RK\u00d7N+ are referred to as the factor loading matrix and the factor score matrix respectively. Similar to SSI-PF, the node attributes are incorporated on the prior of \u03a6."}, {"heading": "2.3. Incorporating Hierarchical Node Attributes", "text": "Relational networks can be associated with hierarchical side information (Hu et al., 2016a). For example, in a patent citation network, patents can be labelled with the International Patent Classification (IPC) code, which is a hierarchy of patent categories and sub-categories. Suppose the second level attributes are stored in a binary matrix F\u2032 \u2208 {0, 1}L\u00d7M whereM is the number of attributes in the second level. Our models can be used to incorporate hierarchical node attributes via a straightforward extension: re-\nplace hyper-parameter \u00b50 in Eq. (6) with \u00b5l,k = \u220fM m \u03b4 f \u2032l,m m,k . This extension mirrors what is done for first level attributes."}, {"heading": "3. Inference with Gibbs Sampling", "text": "Both Sym-NARM and Asym-NARM enjoy local conjugacy so the inference of all latent variables can be done by closed-form Gibbs sampling. Moreover, the inference only needs to be conducted on the non-zero entries in Y and F. This section focuses on the sampling of hl,k (bk), the key variable in the proposed incorporation of node attributes. The sampling of the other latent variables is similar to those in EPM and BGGPF, detailed in (Zhou, 2015;\nZhou et al., 2012). As the sampling for hl,k is analogous in Sym-NARM and Asym-NARM, our introduction will be based on Asym-NARM alone.\nWith the Poisson gamma conjugacy, the likelihood for gi,k with \u03c6i,k marginalised out is:\np(gi,k | xi,\u00b7,k) \u221d (1\u2212 qk)gi,k \u0393(gi,k + xi,\u00b7,k)\n\u0393(gi,k) (19) where xi,\u00b7,k = \u2211\nj xi,j,k and xi,j,k is the latent count. The gamma ratio in Eq. (19), i.e., the Pochhammer symbol for a rising factorial, can be augmented with an auxiliary variable ti,k:\n\u0393(gi,k+xi,\u00b7,k) \u0393(gi,k)\n= \u2211xi,\u00b7,k\nti,k=0 S xi,\u00b7,k ti,k g ti,k i,k where S x t in-\ndicates an unsigned Stirling number of the first kind (Chen et al., 2011; Teh et al., 2012; Zhou & Carin, 2015).\nTakingO(xi,\u00b7,k), ti,k can be directly sampled by a Chinese Restaurant Process with gi,k as the concentration and xi,\u00b7,k as the number of customers:\nti,k \u2190 ti,k + Bern (\ngi,k gi,k + i\u2032\n) for i\u2032 = 1 : xi,\u00b7,k (20)\nwhere Bern(\u00b7) is the Bernoulli distribution. Alternatively, for large xi,\u00b7,k, because the standard deviation of ti,k is O( \u221a\nlog xi,\u00b7,k) (Buntine & Hutter, 2012), one can sample ti,k in a small window around the current value (Du et al., 2010).\nWith the above augmentation and Eq. (15), we get: p(G,H | x:,\u00b7,:,T,F) \u221d (21) N\u220f i=1 K\u220f k=1 S xi,\u00b7,k ti,k e \u2212 log ( 1 1\u2212qk ) gi,k \u00b7 L\u220f l=1 K\u220f k=1 h \u2211N i=1 fi,lti,k l,k\nRecall that all the attributes are binary and hl,k influences gi,k only when fi,l = 1. Extracting all the terms related to\nhl,k in Eq. (21), we get the likelihood of hl,k:\np ( hl,k \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 gi,khl,k , t:,k, f:,l ) \u221d (22)\ne \u2212hl,k log\n( 1\n1\u2212qk )\u2211N i=1:fi,l=1 gi,k hl,k h \u2211N i=1 fi,lti,k\nl,k\nwhere gi,khl,k is the value of gi,k with hl,k removed when fi,l = 1. The likelihood function above is in a form that is conjugate to the gamma prior. Therefore, it is straightforward to yield the following sampling strategy for hl,k:\nhl,k \u223c Ga(\u00b5\u2032, 1/\u03bd\u2032) (23)\n\u00b5\u2032 = \u00b50 + N\u2211 i=1:fi,l=1 ti,k (24)\n\u03bd\u2032 = 1/\u00b50 \u2212 log (1\u2212 qk) N\u2211\ni=1:fi,l=1\ngi,k hl,k\n(25)\nPrecomputed with Eq. (15), gi,k can be updated with Eq. (26), after hl,k is sampled.\ngi,k \u2190 gi,kh\n\u2032 l,k\nhl,k for i = 1 : N and fi,l = 1 (26)\nwhere h\u2032i,k is the newly sampled value of hi,k.\nTo compute Eqs. (24)-(26), we only need to iterate over the nodes that attribute l is active with (i.e., fi,l = 1). Thus, the sampling for H takes O(D\u2032KL) where D\u2032 is the average number of nodes that an attribute is active with. This demonstrates how the sparsity of node attributes is leveraged. As the mean of xi,\u00b7,k is D/K, sampling the tables T \u2208 NN\u00d7K takes O(ND) which can be accelerated with the window sampling technique explained above.\nWe show the computational complexity of our and related models in Table 1. The empirical comparison of running speed is in Section 5.4. By taking advantage of both network sparsity and node attribute sparsity, our models are more efficient than the competitors, especially on large sparse networks with large sets of attributes."}, {"heading": "4. Related work", "text": "Compared with the node-attribute models such as NMDR and niMM whose methods result in complicated inference, our Sym-NARM is much more efficient on large sparse networks, illustrated in Table 1.\nThe most closely related model to our Asym-NARM, also extending the BGGPF algorithm, is SSI-PF. But it uses the gamma additivity to construct the prior of node factor loadings with the sum of attribute factor loadings. Our model has several advantages over SSI-PF: (1) The derivation of Gibbs sampling of SSI-PF requires that each column of \u0398 is normalised (Eq. (18)). This limits the application of SSI-PF to other models such as EPM which is an unnormalised model. (2) Shown in Table 1, Asym-NARM enjoys more efficient computational complexity. (3) Shown\nin Section 5, our model is more effective especially when a node has multiple attributes.\nThere are also models that extend PF and collective matrix factorisation (Singh & Gordon, 2008) to jointly factorise relational networks and document-word matrices such as (Gopalan et al., 2014a; Zhang & Wang, 2015; Acharya et al., 2015). Our NARM models incorporate general node attributes (not only texts) as the priors of the factor loading matrix in a supervised manner, rather than jointly modelling the side information in an unsupervised manner.\nAnother related area is supervised topic models such as (Mcauliffe & Blei, 2008; Ramage et al., 2009; Lim & Buntine, 2016). The Dirichlet Multinomial Regression (DMR) model (Mimno & McCallum, 2012) is the most related one to ours. It models document attributes on the priors of the topic proportions with the logistic-normal transform. For comparison, we propose DMR-MMSB, extending MMSB with the DMR technique to incorporate side information on the mixed-membership distribution of each node."}, {"heading": "5.

Note that Facebook-ego is much denser than the others, which means the network information itself could be rich enough for EPM to reconstruct the network and the node attributes contribute less. However in general, when relational data are highly incomplete (with less training data), our model is able to achieve improved link prediction performance.\nTo illustrate how side information helps, we qualitatively compared our model with EPM and niMM by estimating the link probabilities on NIPS234, shown in Figure 4.

Link Prediction with Hierarchical Node Attributes", "text": "Here we used two datasets with hierarchical node attributes: (1) Cora-hier: a citation network with 1712 papers and 6308 links extracted from the original Cora dataset3. The papers are labelled with one of 63 sub-areas (first level) and each sub-area belongs to one of 10 primary areas (second level), such as \u201cmachine learning in artificial intelligence\u201d and \u201cmemory management in operating systems\u201d; (2) Patent-hier: a citation network with 1461 patents and 2141 links from the National Bureau of Economic Research where the hierarchical International Patent Classification (IPC) code of a patent is used as attributes.\nThe AUC-ROC/PR scores in Figure 6 show that our AsymNARM with hierarchical attributes outperforms the others, which demonstrates leveraging hierarchical side information is beneficial to link prediction. Although SSI-PF also models the hierarchical attributes, its performance in these two datasets is not comparable with our model\u2019s."}, {"heading": "5.4. Running Time", "text": "In this section, we compare the running time of the models for directed networks (all implemented in MATLAB and running on a desktop with 3.40 GHz CPU and 16GB RAM). Using 80% data for training, the running time for Asym-NARM, SSI-PF, and niMM on Aminer with different sets of node attributes is reported in Table 2. Note DMR-MMSB did not complete with \u201cAuthors\u201d and \u201cAll\u201d due to our computational resources. Asym-NARM is about 10 times faster than SSI-PF with all the attributes and about\n3https://people.cs.umass.edu/\u02dcmccallum/ data.html\n2 times faster with the labels. Thus Asym-NARM is more efficient, especially with large sets of attributes, supporting the complexity analysis in Table 1."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "As a summary of the experiments, Asym/Sym-NARM achieved better link prediction performance with faster inference. While EPM, a non-node-attribute model, performed well on nearly complete networks, it degraded with less training data. niMM and DMR-MMSB, extensions to MMSB with the logistic-normal transform, had similar results to Sym-NARM but scaled inefficiently. SSI-PF\u2019s performance and scalability were not as good as Asym-NARM in the presented cases with flat and hierarchical attributes and it was less effective with larger numbers of attributes.\nThus NARM is a comparatively simple yet effective and efficient way of incorporating node attributes, including hierarchical attributes, for relational models with Poisson likelihood. This leads to improved link prediction and matrix completion for less complete relational data of both directed and undirected networks. With the efficient inference, our models can be used to model large sparse relational networks with node attributes.\nNARM can easily be extended to multi-relational networks such as (Hu et al., 2016b) and topic models with document and word attributes, which is left for our future work."}], "references": [{"title": "Gamma process Poisson factorization for joint modeling of network and documents.

Our method works flexibly with both directed and undirected relational networks. The inference can be done by efficient Gibbs sampling which leverages sparsity of both networks and node attributes. Extensive experiments show that our models achieve the stateof-the-art link prediction results, especially with highly incomplete relational data.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
