Negotiation is simultaneously a linguistic and a reasoning problem, in which an intent must be formulated and then verbally realised. Such dialogues contain both cooperative and adversarial elements, and require agents to understand, plan, and generate utterances to achieve their goals (Traum et al., 2008; Asher et al., 2012).\nWe collect the first large dataset of natural language negotiations between two people, and show\n1 https://github.com/facebookresearch/end-to-end-negotiator\nthat end-to-end neural models can be trained to negotiate by maximizing the likelihood of human actions. This approach is scalable and domainindependent, but does not model the strategic skills required for negotiating well. We further show that models can be improved by training and decoding to maximize reward instead of likelihood\u2014by training with self-play reinforcement learning, and using rollouts to estimate the expected reward of utterances during decoding.\nTo study semi-cooperative dialogue, we gather a dataset of 5808 dialogues between humans on a negotiation task. Users were shown a set of items with a value for each, and asked to agree how to divide the items with another user who has a different, unseen, value function (Figure 1).\nWe first train recurrent neural networks to imitate human actions. We find that models trained to maximise the likelihood of human utterances can generate fluent language, but make comparatively poor negotiators, which are overly willing to compromise. We therefore explore two methods for improving the model\u2019s strategic reasoning skills\u2014 both of which attempt to optimise for the agent\u2019s goals, rather than simply imitating humans:\nFirstly, instead of training to optimise likelihood, we show that our agents can be considerably improved using self play, in which pre-trained models practice negotiating with each other in order to optimise performance. To avoid the models diverging from human language, we interleave reinforcement learning updates with supervised updates. For the first time, we show that end-toend dialogue agents trained using reinforcement learning outperform their supervised counterparts in negotiations with humans.\nSecondly, we introduce a new form of planning for dialogue called dialogue rollouts, in which an agent simulates complete dialogues during decoding to estimate the eward of utterances. We show\nthat decoding to maximise the reward function (rather than likelihood) significantly improves performance against both humans and machines.\nAnalysing the performance of our agents, we find evidence of sophisticated negotiation strategies. For example, we find instances of the model feigning interest in a valueless issue, so that it can later \u2018compromise\u2019 by conceding it. Deceit is a complex skill that requires hypothesising the other agent\u2019s beliefs, and is learnt relatively late in child development (Talwar and Lee, 2002). Our agents have learnt to deceive without any explicit human design, simply by trying to achieve their goals.\nThe rest of the paper proceeds as follows: \u00a72 describes the collection of a large dataset of humanhuman negotiation dialogues. \u00a73 describes a baseline supervised model, which we then show can be improved by goal-based training (\u00a74) and decoding (\u00a75). \u00a76 measures the performance of our models and humans on this task, and \u00a77 gives a detailed analysis and suggests future directions."}, {"heading": "2 Data Collection", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Overview", "text": "To enable end-to-end training of negotiation agents, we first develop a novel negotiation task and curate a dataset of human-human dialogues for this task. This task and dataset follow our proposed general framework for studying semicooperative dialogue. Initially, each agent is shown an input specifying a space of possible actions and a reward function which will score the outcome of the negotiation. Agents then sequentially take turns of either sending natural language messages, or selecting that a final decision has been reached. When one agent selects that an\nagreement has been made, both agents independently output what they think the agreed decision was. If conflicting decisions are made, both agents are given zero reward."}, {"heading": "2.2 Task", "text": "Our task is an instance of multi issue bargaining (Fershtman, 1990), and is based on DeVault et al. (2015). Two agents are both shown the same collection of items, and instructed to divide them so that each item assigned to one agent.\nEach agent is given a different randomly generated value function, which gives a non-negative value for each item. The value functions are constrained so that: (1) the total value for a user of all items is 10; (2) each item has non-zero value to at least one user; and (3) some items have nonzero value to both users. These constraints enforce that it is not possible for both agents to receive a maximum score, and that no item is worthless to both agents, so the negotiation will be competitive. After 10 turns, we allow agents the option to complete the negotiation with no agreement, which is worth 0 points to both users. We use 3 item types (books, hats, balls), and between 5 and 7 total items in the pool. Figure 1 shows our interface."}, {"heading": "2.3 Data Collection", "text": "We collected a set of human-human dialogues using Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Our data collection interface was adapted from that of Das et al. (2016).\nWe collected a total of 5808 dialogues, based on 2236 unique scenarios (where a scenario is the\navailable items and values for the two users). We held out a test set of 252 scenarios (526 dialogues).

The examples differ on their input goals, output choice, and whether utterances were read or written.\nTraining examples contain an input goal g, specifying the available items and their values, a dialogue x, and an output decision o specifying which items each agent will receive. Specifically, we represent g as a list of six integers corresponding to the count and value of each of the three item types. Dialogue x is a list of tokens x0..T containing the turns of each agent interleaved with symbols marking whether a turn was written by the agent or their partner, terminating in a special token indicating one agent has marked that an agree-\nment has been made.

We refer to the final hidden state as h g . The model then predicts each token xt from left to right, conditioned on the previous tokens and hg . At each time step t, GRUw takes as input the previous hidden state ht\u22121, previous token xt\u22121 (embedded with a matrix E), and input encoding hg .

Instead, we explore pre-training with supervised learning, and then fine-tuning against the evaluation metric using reinforcement learning. Similar two-stage learning strategies have been used previously (e.g. Li et al. (2016); Das et al. (2017)).\nDuring reinforcement learning, an agent A attempts to improve its parameters from conversations with another agent B. While the other agent B could be a human, in our experiments we used our fixed supervised model that was trained to imitate humans. The second model is fixed as we found that updating the parameters of both agents led to divergence from human language. In effect,\nagent A learns to improve by simulating conversations with the help of a surrogate forward model.\nAgent A reads its goals g and then generates tokens x0..n by sampling from p\u03b8. When x generates an end-of-turn marker, it then reads in tokens xn+1..m generated by agent B. These turns alternate until one agent emits a token ending the dialogue. Both agents then output a decision o and collect a reward from the environment (which will be 0 if they output different decisions). We denote the subset of tokens generated by A as XA (e.g. tokens with incoming arrows in Figure 3b).\nAfter a complete dialogue has been generated, we update agent A\u2019s parameters based on the outcome of the negotiation. Let rA be the score agent A achieved in the completed dialogue, T be the length of the dialogue, \u03b3 be a discount factor that rewards actions at the end of the dialogue more strongly, and \u00b5 be a running average of completed dialogue rewards so far2.

For instance, an agent may be choosing between accepting an offer, or making a counter offer. The former will often have a higher likelihood under our model, as there are fewer ways to agree than to make another offer, but the latter may lead to a better outcome. Goal-based decoding also allows more complex dialogue strategies. For example, a deceptive utterance is likely to have a low model score (as users were generally honest in the supervised data), but may achieve high reward.\nWe instead explore decoding by maximising expected reward. We achieve this by using p\u03b8 as a\nforward model for the complete dialogue, and then deterministically computing the reward. Rewards for an utterance are averaged over samples to calculate expected future reward (Figure 4).\nWe use a two stage process: First, we generate c candidate utterances U = u0..c, representing possible complete turns that the agent could make, which are generated by sampling from p\u03b8 until the end-of-turn token is reached. Let x0..n\u22121 be current dialogue history. We then calculate the expected reward R(u) of candidate utterance u = xn,n+k by repeatedly sampling xn+k+1,T from p\u03b8, then choosing the best output o using Equation 12, and finally deterministically computing the reward r(o). The reward is scaled by the probability of the output given the dialogue, because if the agents select different outputs then they both receive 0 reward.\nR(xn..n+k) = Ex(n+k+1..T ;o)\u223cp\u03b8 [r(o)p\u03b8(o|x0..T )]\n(16)\nWe then return the utterance maximizing R.\nu\u2217 = argmax u\u2208U R(u) (17)\nWe use 5 rollouts for each of 10 candidate turns."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments", "text": ""}, {"heading": "6.1 Training Details", "text": "We implement our models using PyTorch.

The input tokens are embedded into a 64-dimensional space, while the dialogue tokens are embedded with 256-dimensional embeddings (with no pre-training).

The output GRU\u2212\u2192o and GRU\u2190\u2212o both have a hidden state of size 256, the size of hs is 256 as well. During supervised training, we optimise using stochastic gradient descent with a minibatch size of 16, an initial learning rate of 1.0, Nesterov momentum with \u00b5=0.1 (Nesterov, 1983), and clipping gradients whose L2 norm exceeds 0.5. We train the model for 30 epochs and pick the snapshot of the model with the best validation perplexity. We then annealed the learning rate by a factor of 5 each epoch. We weight the terms in the loss function (Equation 10) using \u03b1=0.5. We do not train against output decisions where humans selected different agreements.

Note however, that this divergence may not necessarily correspond to lower quality language\u2014it may also indicate different strategic decisions about what to say. Results in \u00a76.4 show all models could converse with humans."}, {"heading": "6.4 End-to-End Evaluation", "text": "We measure end-to-end performance in dialogues both with the likelihood-based agent and with humans on Mechanical Turk, on held out scenarios.\nHumans were told that they were interacting with other humans, as they had been during the collection of our dataset (and few appeared to realize they were in conversation with machines).\nWe measure the following statistics:\nScore: The average score for each agent (which could be a human or model), out of 10. Agreement: The percentage of dialogues where both agents agreed on the same decision. Pareto Optimality: The percentage of Pareto optimal solutions for agreed deals (a solution is Pareto optimal if neither agent\u2019s score can be improved without lowering the other\u2019s score). Lower scores indicate inefficient negotiations.\nResults are shown in Table 1. Firstly, we see that the RL and ROLLOUTS models achieve significantly better results when negotiating with the LIKELIHOOD model, particularly the RL+ROLLOUTS model. The percentage of Pareto optimal solutions also increases, showing a better exploration of the solution space. Compared to human-human negotiations (Table 2), the best models achieve a higher agreement rate, better scores, and similar Pareto efficiency. This result confirms that attempting to maximise reward can outperform simply imitating humans.\nSimilar trends hold in dialogues with humans, with goal-based reasoning outperforming imitation learning. The ROLLOUTS model achieves comparable scores to its human partners, and the RL+ROLLOUTS model actually achieves higher scores. However, we also find significantly more cases of the goal-based models failing to agree a deal with humans\u2014largely a consequence of their more aggressive negotiation tactics (see \u00a77)."}, {"heading": "7 Analysis", "text": "Table 1 shows large gains from goal-based methods. In this section, we explore the strengths and weaknesses of our models.\nGoal-based models negotiate harder. The RL+ROLLOUTS model has much longer dialogues with humans than LIKELIHOOD (7.2 turns vs. 5.3 on average), indicating that the model is accepting deals less quickly, and negotiating harder.\nA negative consequence of this more aggressive negotiation strategy is that humans were more likely to walk away with no deal, which is reflected in the lower agreement rates. Even though failing to agree was worth 0 points, people often preferred this course over capitulating to an uncompromising opponent\u2014a factor not well captured by the simulated partner in reinforcement learning training or rollouts (as reflected by the larger gains from goal-based models in dialogues with the LIKELIHOOD model). In particular, the goal-based models are prone to simply rephrasing the same demand each turn, which is a more effective strategy against the LIKELIHOOD model than humans. Future work should address this issue.\nFigure 5 shows an example of our goal-based model stubbornly negotiating until it achieves a good outcome.\nModels learn to be deceptive. Deception can be an effective negotiation tactic. We found numerous cases of our models initially feigning interest in a valueless item, only to later \u2018compromise\u2019 by conceding it. Figure 7 shows an example.\nModels produce meaningful novel sentences. One interesting question is whether our models are capable of generating novel sentences in the new circumstances they find themselves in, or if they simply repeat messages from the training data verbatim. We find that 76% of messages produced by the LIKELIHOOD model in self-play were found in the training data. Wemanually examined the novel\nutterances produced by our model, and found that the overwhelming majority were fluent English sentences in isolation\u2014showing that the model has learnt a good language model for the domain (in addition to results that show it uses language effectively to achieve its goals). These results suggest that although neural models are prone to the safer option of repeating sentences from training data, they are capable of generalising when necessary. Future work should choose domains that force a higher degree of diversity in utterances.\nMaintaining multi-sentence coherence is challenging. One common linguistic error we see RL+ROLLOUTS make is to start a message by indicating agreement (e.g. I agree or Deal), but then going on to propose a counter offer\u2014a behaviour that human partners found frustrating. One explanation is that the model has learnt that in the supervised data, messages beginning with I agree are often at the end of the dialogue, and partners rarely reply with further negotiation\u2014so the models using rollouts and reinforcement learning believe this tactic will help their offer to be accepted."}, {"heading": "8 Related Work", "text": "Most work on goal orientated dialogue systems has assumed that state representations are anno-\ntated in the training data (Williams and Young, 2007; Henderson et al., 2014; Wen et al., 2016). The use of state annotations allows a cleaner separation of the reasoning and natural language aspects of dialogues, but our end-to-end approach makes data collection cheaper and allows tasks where it is unclear how to annotate state. Bordes and Weston (2016) explore end-toend goal orientated dialogue with a supervised model\u2014we show improvements over supervised learning with goal-based training and decoding. Recently, He et al. (2017) use task-specific rules to combine the task input and dialogue history into a more structured state representation than ours.\nReinforcement learning (RL) has been applied in many dialogue settings. RL has been widely used to improve dialogue managers, which manage transitions between dialogue states (Singh et al., 2002; Pietquin et al., 2011; Rieser and Lemon, 2011; Gas\u030cic et al., 2013; Fatemi et al., 2016). In contrast, our end-toend approach has no explicit dialogue manager. Li et al. (2016) improve metrics such as diversity for non-goal-orientated dialogue using RL, which would make an interesting extension to our work. Das et al. (2017) use reinforcement learning to improve cooperative bot-bot dialogues. RL has also been used to allow agents to invent new languages (Das et al., 2017; Mordatch and Abbeel, 2017). To our knowledge, our model is the first to use RL to improve the performance of an end-toend goal orientated dialogue system in dialogues with humans.\nWork on learning end-to-end dialogues has concentrated on \u2018chat\u2019 settings, without explicit goals (Ritter et al., 2011; Vinyals and Le, 2015; Li et al., 2015). These dialogues contain a much greater diversity of vocabulary than our domain, but do not\nhave the challenging adversarial elements. Such models are notoriously hard to evaluate (Liu et al., 2016), because the huge diversity of reasonable responses, whereas our task has a clear objective. Our end-to-end approach would also be much more straightforward to integrate into a generalpurpose dialogue agent than one that relied on annotated dialogue states (Dodge et al., 2016).\nThere is a substantial literature on multi-agent bargaining in game-theory, e.g. Nash Jr (1950). There has also been computational work on modelling negotiations (Baarslag et al., 2013)\u2014our work differs in that agents communicate in unrestricted natural language, rather than pre-specified symbolic actions, and our focus on improving performance relative to humans rather than other automated systems. Our task is based on that of DeVault et al. (2015), who study natural language negotiations for pedagogical purposes\u2014their version includes speech rather than textual dialogue, and embodied agents, which would make interesting extensions to our work. The only automated natural language negotiations systems we are aware of have first mapped language to domainspecific logical forms, and then focused on choosing the next dialogue act (Rosenfeld et al., 2014; Cuaya\u0301huitl et al., 2015; Keizer et al., 2017). Our end-to-end approach is the first to to learn comprehension, reasoning and generation skills in a domain-independent data driven way.\nOur use of a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning for training, and stochastic rollouts for decoding, builds on strategies used in game playing agents such as AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2016). Our work is a step towards real-world applications for these techniques.

We gathered a large dataset of human-human ne-\ngotiations, which contain a variety of interesting tactics. We have shown that it is possible to train dialogue agents end-to-end, but that their ability can be much improved by training and decoding to maximise their goals, rather than likelihood. There remains much potential for future work, particularly in exploring other reasoning strategies, and in improving the diversity of utterances without diverging from human language. We will also explore other negotiation tasks, to investigate whether models can learn to share negotiation strategies across domains."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We would like to thank Luke Zettlemoyer and the anonymous EMNLP reviewers for their insightful comments, and the Mechanical Turk workers who helped us collect data."}], "references": [{"title": "Modelling Strategic Conversation: The STAC project", "author": ["Nicholas Asher", "Alex Lascarides", "Oliver Lemon", "Markus Guhe", "Verena Rieser", "Philippe Muller", "Stergos Afantenos", "Farah Benamara", "Laure Vieu", "Pascal Denis"], "venue": "Proceedings of SemDial", "citeRegEx": "Asher et al\\.,? \\Q2012\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Asher et al\\.", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Evaluating Practical Negotiating Agents: Results and Analysis of the 2011", "author": ["Tim Baarslag", "Katsuhide Fujita", "Enrico H Gerding", "Koen Hindriks", "Takayuki Ito", "Nicholas R Jennings", "Catholijn Jonker", "Sarit Kraus", "Raz Lin", "Valentin Robu"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Baarslag et al\\.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baarslag et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate", "author": ["Dzmitry Bahdanau", "KyunghyunCho", "Yoshua Bengio."], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.0473 .", "citeRegEx": "Bahdanau et al\\.,? 2014", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bahdanau et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Learning End-to-End Goal-oriented Dialog", "author": ["Antoine Bordes", "Jason Weston."], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.07683 .", "citeRegEx": "Bordes and Weston.,? 2016", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bordes and Weston.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "On the properties of neural machine translation: Encoder-decoder approaches", "author": ["Kyunghyun Cho", "Bart Van Merri\u00ebnboer", "Dzmitry Bahdanau", "Yoshua Bengio."], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.1259 .", "citeRegEx": "Cho et al\\.,? 2014", "shortCiteRegEx": "Cho et al\\.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Strategic Dialogue Management via Deep Reinforcement Learning", "author": ["Heriberto Cuay\u00e1huitl", "Simon Keizer", "Oliver Lemon."], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.08099 .", "citeRegEx": "Cuay\u00e1huitl et al\\.,? 2015", "shortCiteRegEx": "Cuay\u00e1huitl et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Visual Dialog", "author": ["Abhishek Das", "Satwik Kottur", "Khushi Gupta", "Avi Singh", "Deshraj Yadav", "Jos\u00e9 MF Moura", "Devi Parikh", "Dhruv Batra."], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.08669 .", "citeRegEx": "Das et al\\.,? 2016", "shortCiteRegEx": "Das et al\\.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Learning Cooperative Visual Dialog Agents with Deep Reinforcement Learning", "author": ["Abhishek Das", "Satwik Kottur", "Jos\u00e9 MF Moura", "Stefan Lee", "Dhruv Batra."], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.06585 .", "citeRegEx": "Das et al\\.,? 2017", "shortCiteRegEx": "Das et al\\.", "year": 2017}, {"title": "Toward Natural Turn-taking in a Virtual Human Negotiation Agent", "author": ["David DeVault", "Johnathan Mell", "Jonathan Gratch."], "venue": "AAAI Spring Symposium on Turn-taking and Coordination in HumanMachine Interaction.
