Federal records rely on incomplete cooperation from local police departments, and human rights statisticians assess that they fail to document thousands of fatalities (Lum and Ball, 2015).\nNews articles have emerged as a valuable alternative data source. Organizations including The Guardian, The Washington Post, Mapping Police Violence, and Fatal Encounters have started to build such databases of U.S. police killings\nby manually reading millions of news articles1 and extracting victim names and event details. This approach was recently validated by a Bureau of Justice Statistics study (Banks et al., Dec. 2016) which augmented traditional policemaintained records with media reports, finding twice as many deaths compared to past government analyses. This suggests textual news data has enormous, real value, though manual news analysis remains extremely laborious.\nWe propose to help automate this process by extracting the names of persons killed by police from event descriptions in news articles (Table 1). This can be formulated as either of two cross-document entity-event extraction tasks:\n1. Populating an entity-event database: From a corpus of news articles D(test) over timespan T , extract the names of persons killed by police during that same timespan (E(pred)).\n2. Updating an entity-event database: In addition toD(test), assume access to both a historical database of killings E(train) and a historical news corpus D(train) for events that oc-\n1Fatal Encounters director D.

This setting often occurs in practice, and is the focus of this paper; it allows for the use of distantly supervised learning methods.2\nThe task itself has important social value, but the NLP research community may be interested in a scientific justification as well. We propose that police fatalities are a useful test case for event extraction research. Fatalities are a well defined type of event with clear semantics for coreference, avoiding some of the more complex issues in this area (Hovy et al., 2013). The task also builds on a considerable information extraction literature on knowledge base population (e.g. Craven et al. (1998)). Finally, we posit that the field of natural language processing should, when possible, advance applications of important public interest. Previous work established the value of textual news for this problem, but computational methods could alleviate the scale of manual labor needed to use it.\nTo introduce this problem, we:\n\u2022 Define the task of identifying persons killed by police, which is an instance of crossdocument entity-event extraction (\u00a73.1).\n\u2022 Present a new dataset of web news articles collected throughout 2016 that describe possible fatal encounters with police officers (\u00a73.2).\n\u2022 Introduce, for the database update setting, a distant supervision model (\u00a74) that incorporates feature-based logistic regression and convolutional neural network classifiers under a latent disjunction model.\n\u2022 Demonstrate the approach\u2019s potential usefulness for practitioners: it outperforms two off-the-shelf event extractors (\u00a75) and finds 39 persons not included in the Guardian\u2019s \u201cThe Counted\u201d database of police fatalities as of January 1, 2017 (\u00a76). This constitutes a promising first step, though performance needs to be improved for real-world usage."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "This task combines elements of information extraction, including: event extraction (a.k.a. semantic parsing), identifying descriptions of events and\n2Konovalov et al.

A fatality event indicates the killing of a particular person; we wish to specifically identify the names of fatality victims mentioned in text. Thus our task could be viewed as unary relation extraction: for a given person mentioned in a corpus, were they killed by a police officer?\nPrior work in NLP has produced a number of event extraction systems, trained on text data hand-labeled with a pre-specified ontology, including ones that identify instances of killings (Li and Ji, 2014; Das et al., 2014). Unfortunately, they perform poorly on our task (\u00a75), so we develop a new method.\nSince we do not have access to text specifically annotated for police killing events, we instead turn to distant supervision\u2014inducing labels by aligning relation-entity entries from a gold standard database to their mentions in a corpus (Craven and Kumlien, 1999; Mintz et al., 2009; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Riedel et al., 2010). Similar to this work, Reschke et al. (2014) apply distant supervision to multi-slot, template-based event extraction for airplane crashes; we focus on a simpler unary extraction setting with joint learning of a probabilistic model. Other related work in the crossdocument setting has examined joint inference for relations, entities, and events (Yao et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2015).\nFinally, other natural language processing efforts have sought to extract social behavioral event databases from news, such as instances of protests (Hanna, 2017), gun violence (Pavlick et al., 2016), and international relations (Schrodt and Gerner, 1994; Schrodt, 2012; Boschee et al., 2013; O\u2019Connor et al., 2013; Gerrish, 2013). They can also be viewed as event database population tasks, with differing levels of semantic specificity in the definition of \u201cevent.\u201d"}, {"heading": "3 Task and Data", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Cross-document entity-event extraction for police fatalties", "text": "From a corpus of documents D, the task is to extract a list of candidate person names, E , and for each e \u2208 E find\nP (ye = 1 | xM(e)).

Recall a single entity will have one or more mentions (i.e. the same name occurs in multiple sentences in our corpus). For a given mention i in sentence xi, our model predicts whether the person is described as having been killed by police, zi = 1, with a binary logistic model,\nP (zi = 1 | xi) = \u03c3(\u03b2Tf\u03b3(xi)). (2)\nWe experiment with both logistic regression (\u00a74.4) and convolutional neural networks (\u00a74.5) for this component, which use logistic regression weights \u03b2 and feature extractor parameters \u03b3. Then we must somehow aggregate mention-level decisions to determine entity labels ye.9 If a human reader were to observe at least one sentence that states a person was killed by police, they would infer that person was killed by police. Therefore we aggregate an entity\u2019s mention-level labels with a deterministic disjunction:\nP (ye = 1 | zM(e)) = 1 { \u2228i\u2208M(e) zi } . (3)\nAt test time, zi is latent.

(2009)\u2019s distant supervision assumption, which assumes every mention of a goldpositive entity exhibits a description of a police killing.\nThis assumption is not correct. We manually analyze a sample of positive mentions and find 36 out of 100 name-only sentences did not express a police fatality event\u2014for example, sentences contain commentary, or describe killings not by police. This is similar to the precision for distant supervision of binary relations found by Riedel et al.

Alternatively, at training time we can treat zi as a latent variable and assume, as our model states, that at least one of the mentions asserts the fatality event, but leave uncertainty over which mention (or multiple mentions) conveys this information. This corresponds to multiple instance learning (MIL; Dietterich et al. (1997)) which has been applied to distantly supervised relation extraction by enforcing the at least one constraint at training time (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012; Ritter et al., 2013). Our approach differs by using exact marginal posterior inference for the Estep.\nWith zi as latent, the model can be trained with the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977). We initialize the model by training on the \u201chard\u201d distant labels (\u00a74.2), and then learn improved parameters by alternating E- and M-steps.\nThe E-step requires calculating the marginal posterior probability for each zi,\nq(zi) := P (zi | xM(ei), yei). (9)\nThis corresponds to calculating the posterior probability of a disjunct, given knowledge of the output of the disjunction, and prior probabilities of all disjuncts (given by the mention-level classifier).\nSince P (z | x, y) = P (z, y | x)/P (y | x),\nq(zi = 1) = P (zi = 1, yei = 1|xM(ei))\nP (yei = 1|xM(ei)) . (10)\nThe numerator simplifies to the mention prediction P (zi = 1 | xi) and the denominator is the entity-level noisyor probability (Eq. 6). This has the effect of taking the classifier\u2019s predicted probability and increasing it slightly (since Eq. 10\u2019s denominator is no greater than 1); thus the disjunction constraint implies a soft positive labeling. In the case of a negative entity with ye = 0, the disjunction constraint implies all zM(e) stay clamped to 0 as in the \u201chard\u201d label training method.\nThe q(zi) posterior weights are then used for the M-step\u2019s expected log-likelihood objective:\nmax \u03b8 \u2211 i \u2211 z\u2208{0,1} q(zi = z) logP\u03b8(zi = z | xi).\n(11) This objective (plus regularization) is maximized with gradient ascent as before.\nThis approach can be applied to any mentionlevel probabilistic model; we explore two in the next sections."}, {"heading": "4.4 Feature-based logistic regression", "text": "We construct hand-crafted features for regularized logistic regression (LR) (Table 4), designed to be broadly similar to the n-gram and syntactic dependency features used in previous work on feature-based semantic parsing (e.g. Das et al.

We use randomized feature hashing (Weinberger et al., 2009) to efficiently represent features in 450,000 dimensions, which achieved similar performance as an explicit feature representation.

We use Kim (2014)\u2019s open-source CNN implementation,12 where a logistic function makes the final mention prediction based on max-pooled values from convolutional layers of three different filter sizes, whose parameters are learned (\u03b3 in Eq. 2). We use pretrained word embeddings for initialization,13 and update them during training. We also add two special vectors for the TARGET and PERSON symbols, initialized randomly.14\nFor training, we perform stochastic gradient descent for the negative expected log-likelihood (Eq. 11) by sampling with replacement fifty mentionlabel pairs for each minibatch, choosing each (i, k) \u2208M\u00d7{0, 1} with probability proportional to q(zi = k). This strategy attains the same expected gradient as the overall objective. We use \u201cepoch\u201d to refer to training on 265,700 examples (approx. twice the number of mentions). Unlike EM for logistic regression, we do not run gradient descent to convergence, instead applying an Estep every two epochs to update q; this approach is related to incremental and online variants of EM (Neal and Hinton, 1998; Liang and Klein, 2009), and is justified since both SGD and E-steps improve the evidence lower bound (ELBO). It is also similar to Salakhutdinov et al. (2003)\u2019s expectation gradient method; their analysis implies the gradient calculated immediately after an Estep is in fact the gradient for the marginal loglikelihood.

In modern NLP research, a major paradigm for event extraction is to formulate a hand-crafted ontology of event classes, annotate a small corpus, and craft supervised learn-\ning systems to predict event parses of documents. We evaluate two freely available, off-the-shelf event extractors that were developed under this paradigm: SEMAFOR (Das et al., 2014), and the RPI Joint Information Extraction System (RPIJIE) (Li and Ji, 2014), which output semantic structures following the FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003) and ACE (Doddington et al., 2004) event ontologies, respectively.15 Pavlick et al.

We assume such systems are too narrow for our purposes, since we need an extraction system to handle different trigger constructions like \u201ckilled\u201d versus \u201cshot dead.\u201d\n16For SEMAFOR, we use the FrameNet \u2018Killing\u2019 frame with frame elements \u2018Victim\u2019 and \u2018Killer\u2019.

SEMAFOR defines a token span for every argument; RPI-JIE/ACE defines two spans, both a head word and entity extent; we use the entity extent. SEMAFOR only predicts spans as event arguments, while RPI-JIE also predicts entities as event arguments, where each entity has a within-text coreference chain over one or more mentions; since we only use single sentences, these chains tend to be small, though they do sometimes resolve pronouns.

Part of this is due to inherent difficulty of the task, though our task-specific model still outperforms (Table 5).

This outperformed the individual models\u2014especially for EM training\u2014and showed less fluctuation in AUPRC, which made it easier to detect convergence. Reported performance numbers in Table 5 are with the average of all three runs from the final epoch of training.\nLR vs. CNN: After feature ablation we found that hard-CNN and hard-LR with n-gram features (N1-N5) had comparable AUPRC values (Table 5). But adding dependency features (D1-D4) caused the logistic regression models to outperform the neural networks (albeit with bare significance: p = 0.046). We hypothesize these dependency features capture longer-distance semantic relationships between the entity, fatality trigger word, and police officer, which short n-grams cannot. Moving to sequence or graph LSTMs may better capture such dependencies.\nSoft (EM) training: Using the EM algorithm gives substantially better performance: for the CNN, AUC improves from 0.130 to 0.164, and for LR, from 0.142 to 0.193. (Both improvements are statistically significant.) Logistic regression with EM training is the most accurate model. Examining the precision-recall curves (Fig. 4), many of the gains are in the higher confidence predictions (left side of figure). In fact, the soft EM model makes fewer strongly positive predictions: for example, hard-LR predicts ye = 1 with more than 99% confidence for 170 out of 24,550 test set entities, but soft-LR does so for only 24. This makes sense given that the hard-LR model at training time assumes that many more positive entity mentions are evidence of a killing than they are in reality (\u00a74.2).\nManual analysis: Manual analysis of false positives indicates misspellings or mismatches of names, police fatalities outside of the U.S., people who were shot by police but not killed, and names of police officers who were killed are com-\nmon false positive errors (see detailed table in the appendix). This suggests many prediction errors are from ambiguous or challenging cases.18\nFuture work: While we have made progress on this application, more work is necessary for accuracy to be high enough to be useful for practitioners. Our model allows for the use of mentionlevel semantic parsing models; systems with explicit trigger/agent/patient representations, more like traditional event extraction systems, may be useful, as would more sophisticated neural network models, or attention models as an alternative to disjunction aggregation (Lin et al., 2016).\nOne goal is to use our model as part of a semi-automatic system, where people manually review a ranked list of entity suggestions. In this case, it is more important to focus on improving recall\u2014specifically, improving precision at highrecall points on the precision-recall curve. Our best models, by contrast, tend to improve precision at lower-recall points on the curve. Higher recall may be possible through cost-sensitive training (e.g. Gimpel and Smith (2010)) and using features from beyond single sentences within the document.\nFurthermore, our dataset could be used to contribute to communication studies, by exploring research questions about the dynamics of media attention (for example, the effect of race and geography on coverage of police killings), and discussions of historical killings in news\u2014for example, many articles in 2016 discussed Michael Brown\u2019s 2014 death in Ferguson, Missouri. Improving NLP analysis of historical events would also be useful for the event extraction task itself, by delineating between recent events that re-\n18We attempted to correct non-U.S. false positive errors by using CLAVIN, an open-source country identifier, but this significantly hurt recall.\nquire a database update, versus historical events that appear as \u201cnoise\u201d from the perspective of the database update task. Finally, it may also be possible to adapt our model to extract other types of social behavior events."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was partially supported by the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Credits for Research program.

This effectively removes duplicate mentions that occur in method 2 when the same document is drawn more than once in a sample.\nother, and both are arguably relevant in our context. The bootstrap sampling model assumes a given dataset represents a finite sample from a theoretically infinite population, and asks what variability there would be if a finite sample were to be drawn again from the population. This has different interpretations for entity and document resampling. Resampling entities measures robustness due to variability in the names that occur in the documents. Resampling documents measures robustness due to variability in our data source\u2014 for example, if our document scraping procedure was altered, or potentially, if the news generation process was changed. Since both entities and documents are not i.i.d., these are both dissatisfying assumptions.\nWe also conduct resampling of documents with deduplication of mentions since, during development, we found our noisy-or metric was sensitive to duplicate mentions; this deduplication step effectively includes running our analysis pipeline\u2019s sentence deduplication for each bootstrap sample.\nIn Fig. 9, we augment the results from Fig. 5 with standard errors calculated from B = 10, 000 bootstrap samples given the three methods for sampling described above. Document resampling tends to give smaller standard errors than entity resampling, which is to be expected since there is a larger number of documents than entities. We analyze our results using the standard errors and significance tests from method 3.\nWe examine the statistical significance of difference between models with a one-sided hypothesis test. Our statistic is\nTij = AUPRCmodel j \u2212AUPRCmodel i.\nWe use hypotheses H0 : T \u2264 0 and H1 : T > 0.

Therefore the final p-value comparing systems i and j is actually calculated as min(pij , pji), since the different directions correspond to the fraction of bootstrap samples with Tij \u2264 0 versus Tij > 0; these values are shown in Fig. 10. (Note pji = 1\u2212pij in expectation.) While this seems to follow standard practice in bootstrap hypothesis testing in NLP (BergKirkpatrick et al., 2012), we note that MacKinnon (2009) argues to instead multiply that by two (i.e., calculate 2min(pij , pji)) to conduct a two-sided test that correctly gives p \u223c Unif(0, 1) when a null hypothesis of equivalent performance is true."}], "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2017, "abstractText": "We propose a new, socially-impactful task for natural language processing: from a news corpus, extract names of persons who have been killed by police.
