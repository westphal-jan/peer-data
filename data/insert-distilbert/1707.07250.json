The central challenge in multimodal sentiment analysis is to model the inter-modality dynamics: the interactions between\n\u2020 means equal contribution\nlanguage, visual and acoustic behaviors that change the perception of the expressed sentiment.\nFigure 1 illustrates these complex inter-modality dynamics. The utterance \u201cThis movie is sick\u201d can be ambiguous (either positive or negative) by itself, but if the speaker is also smiling at the same time, then it will be perceived as positive. On the other hand, the same utterance with a frown would be perceived negatively. A person speaking loudly \u201cThis movie is sick\u201d would still be ambiguous. These examples are illustrating bimodal interactions. Examples of trimodal interactions are shown in Figure 1 when loud voice increases the sentiment to strongly positive. The complexity of inter-modality dynamics is shown in the second trimodal example where the utterance \u201cThis movie is fair\u201d is still weakly positive, given the strong influence of the word \u201cfair\u201d.\nA second challenge in multimodal sentiment analysis is efficiently exploring intra-modality dynamics of a specific modality (unimodal interaction). Intra-modality dynamics are particularly\nar X\niv :1\n70 7.\n07 25\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n3 Ju\nl 2 01\n7\nchallenging for the language analysis since multimodal sentiment analysis is performed on spoken language. A spoken opinion such as \u201cI think it was alright . . . Hmmm . . . let me think . . . yeah . . . no . . . ok yeah\u201d almost never happens in written text. This volatile nature of spoken opinions, where proper language structure is often ignored, complicates sentiment analysis. Visual and acoustic modalities also contain their own intra-modality dynamics which are expressed through both space and time.\nPrevious works in multimodal sentiment analysis does not account for both intra-modality and intermodality dynamics directly, instead they either perform early fusion (a.k.a., feature-level fusion) or late fusion (a.k.a., decision-level fusion). Early fusion consists in simply concatenating multimodal features mostly at input level (Morency et al., 2011; Pe\u0301rez-Rosas et al., 2013; Poria et al., 2016). This fusion approach does not allow the intra-modality dynamics to be efficiently modeled. This is due to the fact that inter-modality dynamics can be more complex at input level and can dominate the learning process or result in overfitting. Late fusion, instead, consists in training unimodal classifiers independently and performing decision voting (Wang et al., 2016; Zadeh et al., 2016a). This prevents the model from learning inter-modality dynamics in an efficient way by assuming that simple weighted averaging is a proper fusion approach.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new model, termed Tensor Fusion Network (TFN), which learns both the intra-modality and inter-modality dynamics end-to-end. Inter-modality dynamics are modeled with a new multimodal fusion approach, named Tensor Fusion, which explicitly aggregates unimodal, bimodal and trimodal interactions. Intramodality dynamics are modeled through three Modality Embedding Subnetworks, for language, visual and acoustic modalities, respectively.\nIn our extensive set of experiments, we show (a) that TFN outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches for multimodal sentiment analysis, (b) the characteristics and capabilities of our Tensor Fusion approach for multimodal sentiment analysis, and (c) that each of our three Modality Embedding Subnetworks (language, visual and acoustic) are also outperforming unimodal state-of-the-art unimodal sentiment analysis approaches."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Sentiment Analysis is a well-studied research area in NLP (Pang et al., 2008). Various approaches have been proposed to model sentiment from language, including methods that focus on opinionated words (Hu and Liu, 2004; Taboada et al., 2011; Poria et al., 2014b; Cambria et al., 2016), n-grams and language models (Yang and Cardie, 2012), sentiment compositionality and dependency-based analysis (Socher et al., 2013; Poria et al., 2014a; Agarwal et al., 2015; Tai et al., 2015), and distributional representations for sentiment (Iyyer et al., 2015).\nMultimodal Sentiment Analysis is an emerging research area that integrates verbal and nonverbal behaviors into the detection of user sentiment. There exist several multimodal datasets that include sentiment annotations, including the newly-introduced CMU-MOSI dataset (Zadeh et al., 2016b), as well as other datasets including ICT-MMMO (Wo\u0308llmer et al., 2013), YouTube (Morency et al., 2011), and MOUD (Pe\u0301rez-Rosas et al., 2013), however CMUMOSI is the only English dataset with utterancelevel sentiment labels. The newest multimodal sentiment analysis approaches have used deep neural networks, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with multiple-kernel learning (Poria et al., 2015), SAL-CNN (Wang et al., 2016) which learns generalizable features across speakers, and support vector machines (SVMs) with a multimodal dictionary (Zadeh, 2015).\nAudio-Visual Emotion Recognition is closely tied to multimodal sentiment analysis (Poria et al., 2017). Both audio and visual features have been shown to be useful in the recognition of emotions (Ghosh et al., 2016a). Using facial expressions and audio cues jointly has been the focus of many recent studies (Glodek et al., 2011; Valstar et al., 2016; Nojavanasghari et al., 2016).\nMultimodal Machine Learning has been a growing trend in machine learning research that is closely tied to the studies in this paper. Creative and novel applications of using multiple modalities have been among successful recent research directions in machine learning (You et al., 2016; Donahue et al., 2015; Antol et al., 2015; Specia et al., 2016; Tong et al., 2017)."}, {"heading": "3 CMU-MOSI Dataset", "text": "Multimodal Opinion Sentiment Intensity (CMUMOSI) dataset is an annotated dataset of video\n0 100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\nHighly Negative Negative Weakly Negative Neutral Weakly Positive Positive Highly Positive\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\n100%\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35\nPe rc\nen ta\nge o\nf S en\ntim en\nt D eg\nre es\nUtterance Size\nHighly Positive\nPositive\nWeakly Positive\nNeutral\nWeakly Negative\nNegative\nHighly Negative\nN um\nbe r o\nf O pi\nni on\nS eg\nm en\nts\nFigure 2: Distribution of sentiment across different opinions (left) and opinion sizes (right) in CMU-MOSI.\nopinions from YouTube movie reviews (Zadeh et al., 2016a). Annotation of sentiment has closely followed the annotation scheme of the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (Socher et al., 2013), where sentiment is annotated on a seven-step Likert scale from very negative to very positive. However, whereas the Stanford Sentiment Treebank is segmented by sentence, the CMU-MOSI dataset is segmented by opinion utterances to accommodate spoken language where sentence boundaries are not as clear as text. There are 2199 opinion utterances for 93 distinct speakers in CMU-MOSI. There are an average 23.2 opinion segments in each video. Each video has an average length of 4.2 seconds. There are a total of 26,295 words in the opinion utterances. These utterance are annotated by five Mechanical Turk annotators for sentiment. The final agreement between the annotators is high in terms of Krippendorf\u2019s alpha \u03b1 = 0.77. Figure 2 shows the distribution of sentiment across different opinions and different opinion sizes. CMU-MOSI dataset facilitates three prediction tasks, each of which we address in our experiments: 1) Binary Sentiment Classification 2) Five-Class Sentiment Classification (similar to Stanford Sentiment Treebank fine-grained classification with seven scale being mapped to five) and 3) Sentiment Regression in range [\u22123, 3]. For sentiment regression, we report Mean-Absolute Error (lower is better) and correlation (higher is better) between the model predictions and regression ground truth."}, {"heading": "4 Tensor Fusion Network", "text": "Our proposed TFN consists of three major components: 1) Modality Embedding Subnetworks take as input unimodal features, and output a rich modality embedding. 2) Tensor Fusion Layer explicitly models the unimodal, bimodal and trimodal interactions using a 3-fold Cartesian product from modality embeddings. 3) Sentiment Inference Subnetwork is a\nnetwork conditioned on the output of the Tensor Fusion Layer and performs sentiment inference. Depending on the task from Section 3 the network output changes to accommodate binary classification, 5-class classification or regression. Input to the TFN is an opinion utterance which includes three modalities of language, visual and acoustic. The following three subsections describe the TFN subnetworks and their inputs in detail."}, {"heading": "4.1 Modality Embedding Subnetworks", "text": "Spoken Language Embedding Subnetwork: Spoken text is different than written text (reviews, tweets) in compositionality and grammar. We revisit the spoken opinion: \u201cI think it was alright . . . Hmmm . . . let me think . . . yeah . . . no . . . ok yeah\u201d. This form of opinion rarely happens in written language but variants of it are very common in spoken language. The first part conveys the actual message and the rest is speaker thinking out loud eventually agreeing with the first part. The key factor in dealing with this volatile nature of spoken language is to build models that are capable of operating in presence of unreliable and idiosyncratic speech traits by focusing on important parts of speech.\nOur proposed approach to deal with challenges of spoken language is to learn a rich representation of spoken words at each word interval and use it as input to a fully connected deep network (Figure 3). This rich representation for ith word contains information from beginning of utterance through time, as well as ith word. This way as the model is discovering the meaning of the utterance through time, if it encounters unusable information in word i+ 1 and arbitrary number of words after, the representation up until i is not diluted or lost. Also, if the model encounters usable information again, it can recover by embedding those in the long short-term memory (LSTM). The time-dependent\nencodings are usable by the rest of the pipeline by simply focusing on relevant parts using the nonlinear affine transformation of time-dependent embeddings which can act as a dimension reducing attention mechanism. To formally define our proposed Spoken Language Embedding Subnetwork (Ul), let l = {l1, l2, l3, . . . , lTl ; lt \u2208 R300}, where Tl is the number of words in an utterance, be the set of spoken words represented as a sequence of 300-dimensional GloVe word vectors (Pennington et al., 2014).\nA LSTM network (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) with a forget gate (Gers et al., 2000) is used to learn time-dependent language representations hl = {h1, h2, h3, . . . , hTl ;ht \u2208 R128} for words according to the following LSTM formulation.\ni f o m  =  sigmoid sigmoid sigmoid tanh Wld (XtWleht\u22121 )\nct = f ct\u22121 + i m ht = o\u2297 tanh(ct) hl = [h1;h2;h3; . . . ;hTl ]\nhl is a matrix of language representations formed from concatenation of h1, h2, h3, . . . hTl . hl is then used as input to a fully-connected network that generates language embedding zl:\nzl = Ul(l; Wl) \u2208 R128\nwhere Wl is the set of all weights in the Ul network (including Wld , Wle ,Wlfc , and blfc), \u03c3 is the sigmoid function.\nVisual Embedding Subnetwork: Since opinion videos consist mostly of speakers talking to the audience through close-up camera, face is the most important source of visual information. The speaker\u2019s face is detected for each frame (sampled at 30Hz) and indicators of the seven basic emotions\n(anger, contempt, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise) and two advanced emotions (frustration and confusion) (Ekman, 1992) are extracted using FACET facial expression analysis framework1. A set of 20 Facial Action Units (Ekman et al., 1980), indicating detailed muscle movements on the face, are also extracted using FACET. Estimates of head position, head rotation, and 68 facial landmark locations also extracted per frame using OpenFace (Baltrus\u030caitis et al., 2016; Zadeh et al., 2017).\nLet the visual features v\u0302j = [v1j , v 2 j , v 3 j , . . . , v p j ] for frame j of utterance video contain the set of p visual features, with Tv the number of total video frames in utterance. We perform mean pooling over the frames to obtain the expected visual features v = [E[v1],E[v2],E[v3], . . . ,E[vl]]. v is then used as input to the Visual Embedding Subnetwork Uv. Since information extracted using FACET from videos is rich, using a deep neural network would be sufficient to produce meaningful embeddings of visual modality. We use a deep neural network with three hidden layers of 32 ReLU units and weights Wv. Empirically we observed that making the model deeper or increasing the number of neurons in each layer does not lead to better visual performance. The subnetwork output provides the visual embedding zv:\nzv = Uv(v; Wv) \u2208 R32\nAcoustic Embedding Subnetwork: For each opinion utterance audio, a set of acoustic features are extracted using COVAREP acoustic analysis framework (Degottex et al., 2014), including 12 MFCCs, pitch tracking and Voiced/UnVoiced segmenting features (using the additive noise robust Summation of Residual Harmonics (SRH) method (Drugman and Alwan, 2011)), glottal source parameters (estimated by glottal inverse filtering based on GCI synchronous IAIF (Drugman et al., 2012; Alku, 1992; Alku et al., 2002, 1997; Titze and Sundberg, 1992; Childers and Lee, 1991)), peak slope parameters (Degottex et al., 2014), maxima dispersion quotients (MDQ) (Kane and Gobl, 2013), and estimations of the Rd shape parameter of the Liljencrants-Fant (LF) glottal model (Fujisaki and Ljungqvist, 1986). These extracted features capture different characteristics of human voice and have been shown to be related to emotions (Ghosh et al., 2016b).\n1http://goo.gl/1rh1JN\nFor each opinion segment with Ta audio frames (sampled at 100Hz; i.e., 10ms), we extract the set of q acoustic features a\u0302j = [a1j , a 2 j , a 3 j , . . . , a q j ] for audio frame j in utterance. We perform mean pooling per utterance on these extracted acoustic features to obtain the expected acoustic features a = [E[a1],E[a2],E[a3], . . . ,E[q]]. Here, a is the input to the Audio Embedding Subnetwork Ua. Since COVAREP also extracts rich features from audio, using a deep neural network is sufficient to model the acoustic modality. Similar to Uv, Ua is a network with 3 layers of 32 ReLU units with weights Wa.\nHere, we also empirically observed that making the model deeper or increasing the number of neurons in each layer does not lead to better performance. The subnetwork produces the audio embedding za:\nza = Ua(a;Wa) \u2208 R32"}, {"heading": "4.2 Tensor Fusion Layer", "text": "While previous works in multimodal research has used feature concatenation as an approach for multimodal fusion, we aim to build a fusion layer in TFN that disentangles unimodal, bimodal and trimodal dynamics by modeling each of them explicitly. We call this layer Tensor Fusion, which is defined as the following vector field using three-fold Cartesian product:{\n(zl, zv, za) | zl \u2208 [ zl\n1\n] , zv \u2208 [ zv\n1\n] , za \u2208 [ za\n1\n]}\nThe extra constant dimension with value 1 generates the unimodal and bimodal dynamics. Each neural coordinate (zl, zv, za) can be seen as a 3-D point in the 3-fold Cartesian space defined by the language, visual, and acoustic embeddings dimensions [zl1]T , [zv1]T , and [za1]T .\nThis definition is mathematically equivalent to a differentiable outer product between zl, the visual representation zv, and the acoustic representation za.\nzm =\n[ zl\n1\n] \u2297 [ zv\n1\n] \u2297 [ za\n1 ] Here\u2297 indicates the outer product between vectors and zm \u2208 R129\u00d733\u00d733 is the 3D cube of all possible combination of unimodal embeddings with seven semantically distinct subregions in Figure 4. The first three subregions zl, zv, and za are unimodal embeddings from Modality Embedding Subnetworks forming unimodal interactions in Tensor Fusion. Three subregions zl \u2297 zv, zl \u2297 za, and zv \u2297 za capture bimodal interactions in Tensor Fusion. Finally, zl \u2297 zv \u2297 za captures trimodal interactions.\nEarly fusion commonly used in multimodal research dealing with language, vision and audio, can be seen as a special case of Tensor Fusion with only unimodal interactions. Since Tensor Fusion is mathematically formed by an outer product, it has no learnable parameters and we empirically observed that although the output tensor is high dimensional, chances of overfitting are low.\nWe argue that this is due to the fact that the output neurons of Tensor Fusion are easy to interpret and semantically very meaningful (i.e., the manifold that they lie on is not complex but just high dimensional). Thus, it is easy for the subsequent layers of the network to decode the meaningful information."}, {"heading": "4.3 Sentiment Inference Subnetwork", "text": "After Tensor Fusion layer, each opinion utterance can be represented as a multimodal tensor zm. We use a fully connected deep neural network called Sentiment Inference Subnetwork Us with weights Ws conditioned on zm. The architecture of the network consists of two layers of 128 ReLU activation units connected to decision layer. The likelihood function of the Sentiment Inference Subnetwork is defined as follows, where \u03c6 is the sentiment prediction:\narg max \u03c6 p(\u03c6 | zm;Ws) = arg max \u03c6 Us(zm;Ws)\nIn our experiments, we use three variations of the Us network. The first network is trained for binary sentiment classification, with a single sigmoid output neuron using binary cross-entropy loss. The second network is designed for five-class sentiment classification, and uses a softmax probability function using categorical cross-entropy loss. The third network uses a single sigmoid output, using meansquarred error loss to perform sentiment regression."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "In this paper, we devise three sets of experiments each addressing a different research question:\nExperiment 1: We compare our TFN with previous state-of-the-art approaches in multimodal sentiment analysis.\nExperiment 2: We study the importance of the TFN subtensors and the impact of each individual modality (see Figure 4).

This example contains a bimodal interaction where the visual modality shows a negative expression (frowning) which is correctly captured by our TFN approach.\nIn the second example, the spoken words are ambiguous since the model has no clue what a B is except a token, but the acoustic and visual modalities are bringing complementary evidences. Our TFN approach correctly identify this trimodal interaction and predicts a positive sentiment.
