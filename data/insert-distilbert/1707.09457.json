These tasks aim at extracting rich seman-\ntics from images and require large quantities of labeled data, predominantly retrieved from the web. Methods often combine structured prediction and deep learning to model correlations between labels and images to make judgments that otherwise would have weak visual support. For example, in the first image of Figure 1, it is possible to predict a spatula by considering that it is a common tool used for the activity cooking. Yet such methods run the risk of discovering and exploiting societal biases present in the underlying web corpora. Without properly quantifying and reducing the reliance on such correlations, broad adoption of these models can have the inadvertent effect of magnifying stereotypes.\nIn this paper, we develop a general framework for quantifying bias and study two concrete tasks, visual semantic role labeling (vSRL) and multilabel object classification (MLC). In vSRL, we use the imSitu formalism (Yatskar et al., 2016, 2017), where the goal is to predict activities, objects and the roles those objects play within an activity. For MLC, we use MS-COCO (Lin et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015), a recognition task covering 80 object classes. We use gender bias as a running example and show that both supporting datasets for these tasks are biased with respect to a gender binary1.\nOur analysis reveals that over 45% and 37% of verbs and objects, respectively, exhibit bias toward a gender greater than 2:1. For example, as seen in Figure 1, the cooking activity in imSitu is a heavily biased verb. Furthermore, we show that after training state-of-the-art structured predictors, models amplify the existing bias, by 5.0% for vSRL, and 3.6% in MLC.\n1To simplify our analysis, we only consider a gender binary as perceived by annotators in the datasets. We recognize that a more fine-grained analysis would be needed for deployment in a production system. Also, note that the proposed approach can be applied to other NLP tasks and other variables such as identification with a racial or ethnic group.\nar X\niv :1\n70 7.\n09 45\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 9\nJu l 2\n01 7\nTo mitigate the role of bias amplification when training models on biased corpora, we propose a novel constrained inference framework, called RBA, for Reducing Bias Amplification in predictions. Our method introduces corpus-level constraints so that gender indicators co-occur no more often together with elements of the prediction task than in the original training distribution. For example, as seen in Figure 1, we would like noun man to occur in the agent role of the cooking as often as it occurs in the imSitu training set when evaluating on a development set. We combine our calibration constraint with the original structured predictor and use Lagrangian relaxation (Korte and Vygen, 2008; Rush and Collins, 2012) to reweigh bias creating factors in the original model.\nWe evaluate our calibration method on imSitu vSRL and COCO MLC and find that in both instances, our models substantially reduce bias amplification. For vSRL, we reduce the average magnitude of bias amplification by 40.5%. For MLC, we are able to reduce the average magnitude of bias amplification by 47.5%. Overall, our calibration methods do not affect the performance of the underlying visual system, while substantially reducing the reliance of the system on socially biased correlations2.\n2Code and data are available at https://github. com/uclanlp/reducingbias"}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "As intelligence systems start playing important roles in our daily life, ethics in artificial intelligence research has attracted significant interest. It is known that big-data technologies sometimes inadvertently worsen discrimination due to implicit biases in data (Podesta et al., 2014). Such issues have been demonstrated in various learning systems, including online advertisement systems (Sweeney, 2013), word embedding models (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Caliskan et al., 2017), online news (Ross and Carter, 2011), web search (Kay et al., 2015), and credit score (Hardt et al., 2016). Data collection biases have been discussed in the context of creating image corpus (Misra et al., 2016; van Miltenburg, 2016) and text corpus (Gordon and Van Durme, 2013; Van Durme, 2010). In contrast, we show that given a gender biased corpus, structured models such as conditional random fields, amplify the bias.\nThe effect of the data imbalance can be easily detected and fixed when the prediction task is simple. For example, when classifying binary data with unbalanced labels (i.e., samples in the majority class dominate the dataset), a classifier trained exclusively to optimize accuracy learns to always predict the majority label, as the cost of making mistakes on samples in the minority class can be neglected. Various approaches have been proposed to make a \u201cfair\u201d binary classification (Barocas and Selbst, 2014; Dwork et al., 2012; Feldman\net al., 2015; Zliobaite, 2015). For structured prediction tasks the effect is harder to quantify and we are the first to propose methods to reduce bias amplification in this context.\nLagrangian relaxation and dual decomposition techniques have been widely used in NLP tasks (e.g., (Sontag et al., 2011; Rush and Collins, 2012; Chang and Collins, 2011; Peng et al., 2015)) for dealing with instance-level constraints. Similar techniques (Chang et al., 2013; Dalvi, 2015) have been applied in handling corpus-level constraints for semi-supervised multilabel classification. In contrast to previous works aiming for improving accuracy performance, we incorporate corpus-level constraints for reducing gender bias."}, {"heading": "3 Visualizing and Quantifying Biases", "text": "Modern statistical learning approaches capture correlations among output variables in order to make coherent predictions. However, for realworld applications, some implicit correlations are not appropriate, especially if they are amplified. In this section, we present a general framework to analyze inherent biases learned and amplified by a prediction model.\nIdentifying bias We consider that prediction problems involve several inter-dependent output variables y1, y2, ...yK , which can be represented as a structure y = {y1, y2, ...yK} \u2208 Y . This is a common setting in NLP applications, including tagging, and parsing. For example, in the vSRL task, the output can be represented as a structured table as shown in Fig 1. Modern techniques often model the correlation between the sub-components in y and make a joint prediction over them using a structured prediction model. More details will be provided in Section 4.\nWe assume there is a subset of output variables g \u2286 y, g \u2208 G that reflects demographic attributes such as gender or race (e.g. g \u2208 G = {man,woman} is the agent), and there is another subset of the output o \u2286 y, o \u2208 O that are corelated with g (e.g., o is the activity present in an image, such as cooking). The goal is to identify the correlations that are potentially amplified by a learned model.\nTo achieve this, we define the bias score of a given output, o, with respect to a demographic\nvariable, g, as:\nb(o, g) = c(o, g)\u2211\ng\u2032\u2208G c(o, g \u2032) ,\nwhere c(o, g) is the number of occurrences of o and g in a corpus. For example, to analyze how genders of agents and activities are co-related in vSRL, we define the gender bias toward man for each verb b(verb,man) as:\nc(verb,man)\nc(verb,man) + c(verb,woman) . (1)\nIf b(o, g) > 1/\u2016G\u2016, then o is positively correlated with g and may exhibit bias.\nEvaluating bias amplification To evaluate the degree of bias amplification, we propose to compare bias scores on the training set, b\u2217(o, g), with bias scores on an unlabeled evaluation set of images b\u0303(o, g) that has been annotated by a predictor. We assume that the evaluation set is identically distributed to the training set. Therefore, if o is positively correlated with g (i.e, b\u2217(o, g) > 1/\u2016G\u2016) and b\u0303(o, g) is larger than b\u2217(o, g), we say bias has been amplified. For example, if b\u2217(cooking,woman) = .66, and b\u0303(cooking,woman) = .84, then the bias of woman toward cooking has been amplified. Finally, we define the mean bias amplification as:\n1 |O| \u2211 g \u2211 o\u2208{o\u2208O|b\u2217(o,g)>1/\u2016G\u2016} b\u0303(o, g)\u2212 b\u2217(o, g).\nThis score estimates the average magnitude of bias amplification for pairs of o and g which exhibited bias."}, {"heading": "4 Calibration Algorithm", "text": "In this section, we introduce Reducing Bias Amplification, RBA, a debiasing technique for calibrating the predictions from a structured prediction model. The intuition behind the algorithm is to inject constraints to ensure the model predictions follow the distribution observed from the training data. For example, the constraints added to the vSRL system ensure the gender ratio of each verb in Eq. (1) are within a given margin based on the statistics of the training data. These constraints are applied at the corpus level, because computing gender ratio requires the predictions of all test\ninstances. As a result, a joint inference over test instances is required3. Solving such a giant inference problem with constraints is hard. Therefore, we present an approximate inference algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation. The advantages of this approach are:\n\u2022 Our algorithm is iterative, and at each iteration, the joint inference problem is decomposed to a per-instance basis. This can be solved by the original inference algorithm. That is, our approach works as a metaalgorithm and developers do not need to implement a new inference algorithm.\n\u2022 The approach is general and can be applied in any structured model.\n\u2022 Lagrangian relaxation guarantees the solution is optimal if the algorithm converges and all constraints are satisfied.\nIn practice, it is hard to obtain a solution where all corpus-level constrains are satisfied. However, we show that the performance of the proposed approach is empirically strong. We use imSitu for vSRL as a running example to explain our algorithm.\nStructured Output Prediction As we mentioned in Sec. 3, we assume the structured output y \u2208 Y consists of several sub-components. Given a test instance i as an input, the inference problem is to find\nargmax y\u2208Y f\u03b8(y, i),\nwhere f\u03b8(y, i) is a scoring function based on a model \u03b8 learned from the training data. The structured output y and the scoring function f\u03b8(y, i) can be decomposed into small components based on an independence assumption. For example, in the vSRL task, the output y consists of two types of binary output variables {yv} and {yv,r}. The variable yv = 1 if and only if the activity v is chosen. Similarly, yv,r = 1 if and only if both the activity v and the semantic role r are assigned 4. The scoring function f\u03b8(y, i) is decomposed accordingly such that:\nf\u03b8(y, i) = \u2211 v yvs\u03b8(v, i) + \u2211 v,r yv,rs\u03b8(v, r, i),\n3A sufficiently large sample of test instances must be used so that bias statistics can be estimated. In this work we use the entire test set for each respective problem.\n4We use r to refer to a combination of role and noun. For example, one possible value indicates an agent is a woman.\nrepresents the overall score of an assignment, and s\u03b8(v, i) and s\u03b8(v, r, i) are the potentials of the subassignments. The output space Y contains all feasible assignments of yv and yv,r, which can be represented as instance-wise constraints. For example, the constraint, \u2211 v yv = 1 ensures only one activity is assigned to one image.\nCorpus-level Constraints Our goal is to inject constraints to ensure the output labels follow a desired distribution. For example, we can set a constraint to ensure the gender ratio for each activity in Eq. (1) is within a given margin. Let yi = {yiv} \u222a {yiv,r} be the output assignment for test instance i5. For each activity v\u2217, the constraints can be written as\nb\u2217\u2212\u03b3\u2264 \u2211 i y i v=v\u2217,r\u2208M\u2211\ni y i v=v\u2217,r\u2208W+ \u2211 i y i v=v\u2217,r\u2208M \u2264b\u2217 + \u03b3\n(2) where b\u2217 \u2261 b\u2217(v\u2217,man) is the desired gender ratio of an activity v\u2217, \u03b3 is a user-specified margin. M and W are a set of semantic role-values representing the agent as a man or a woman, respectively.\nNote that the constraints in (2) involve all the test instances. Therefore, it requires a joint inference over the entire test corpus. In general, these corpus-level constraints can be represented in a form of A \u2211 i y i \u2212 b \u2264 0, where each row in the matrix A \u2208 Rl\u00d7K is the coefficients of one constraint, and b \u2208 Rl. The constrained inference problem can then be formulated as:\nmax {yi}\u2208{Y i} \u2211 i f\u03b8(y i, i),\ns.t. A \u2211 i yi \u2212 b \u2264 0, (3)\nwhere {Y i} represents a space spanned by possible combinations of labels for all instances. Without the corpus-level constraints, Eq. (3) can be optimized by maximizing each instance i\nmax yi\u2208Y i\nf\u03b8(y i, i),\nseparately.\nLagrangian Relaxation Eq. (3) can be solved by several combinatorial optimization methods. For example, one can represent the problem as an\n5For the sake of simplicity, we abuse the notations and use i to represent both input and data index.\ninteger linear program and solve it using an offthe-shelf solver (e.g., Gurobi (Gurobi Optimization, 2016)). However, Eq. (3) involves all test instances. Solving a constrained optimization problem on such a scale is difficult. Therefore, we consider relaxing the constraints and solve Eq. (3) using a Lagrangian relaxation technique (Rush and Collins, 2012). We introduce a Lagrangian multiplier \u03bbj \u2265 0 for each corpus-level constraint. The Lagrangian is\nL(\u03bb, {yi}) =\u2211 i f\u03b8(y i)\u2212 l\u2211 j=1 \u03bbj ( Aj \u2211 i yi \u2212 bj ) , (4)\nwhere all the \u03bbj \u2265 0,\u2200j \u2208 {1, . . . , l}. The solution of Eq. (3) can be obtained by the following iterative procedure:\n1) At iteration t, get the output solution of each instance i\nyi,(t) = argmax y\u2208Y \u2032 L(\u03bb(t\u22121), y) (5)\n2) update the Lagrangian multipliers.\n\u03bb(t)=max ( 0, \u03bb(t\u22121)+\n\u2211 i \u03b7(Ayi,(t) \u2212 b)\n) ,\nwhere \u03bb(0) = 0. \u03b7 is the learning rate for updating \u03bb. Note that with a fixed \u03bb(t\u22121), Eq. (5) can be solved using the original inference algorithms. The algorithm loops until all constraints are satisfied (i.e. optimal solution achieved) or reach maximal number of iterations."}, {"heading": "5 Experimental Setup", "text": "In this section, we provide details about the two visual recognition tasks we evaluated for bias: visual semantic role labeling (vSRL), and multi-label classification (MLC).

Yet such models risk potentially leveraging social bias in their training data. In this paper, we presented a general framework for visualizing and quantifying biases in such models and proposed RBA to calibrate their predictions under two different settings. Taking gender bias as an example, our analysis demonstrates that conditional random fields can amplify social bias from data while our approach RBA can help to reduce the bias.\nOur work is the first to demonstrate structured prediction models amplify bias and the first to propose methods for reducing this effect but significant avenues for future work remain. While RBA can be applied to any structured predictor, it is unclear whether different predictors amplify bias more or less. Furthermore, we presented only one method for measuring bias. More extensive analysis could explore the interaction among predictor, bias measurement, and bias deamplification method. Future work also includes applying bias reducing methods in other structured domains, such as pronoun reference resolution (Mitkov, 2014).\nAcknowledgement This work was supported in part by National Science Foundation Grant IIS1657193 and two NVIDIA Hardware Grants."}], "references": [{"title": "Vqa: Visual question answering", "author": ["Stanislaw Antol", "Aishwarya Agrawal", "Jiasen Lu", "Margaret Mitchell", "Dhruv Batra", "C Lawrence Zitnick", "Devi Parikh."], "venue": "Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 2425\u20132433.", "citeRegEx": "Antol et al\\.,? 2015", "shortCiteRegEx": "Antol et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "The Berkeley framenet project", "author": ["Collin F Baker", "Charles J Fillmore", "John B Lowe."], "venue": "Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 86\u201390.", "citeRegEx": "Baker et al\\.,? 1998", "shortCiteRegEx": "Baker et al\\.", "year": 1998}, {"title": "Big data\u2019s disparate impact", "author": ["Solon Barocas", "Andrew D Selbst."], "venue": "Available at SSRN 2477899.", "citeRegEx": "Barocas and Selbst.,? 2014", "shortCiteRegEx": "Barocas and Selbst.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases", "author": ["Aylin Caliskan", "Joanna J Bryson", "Arvind Narayanan."], "venue": "Science, 356(6334):183\u2013186.", "citeRegEx": "Caliskan et al\\.,? 2017", "shortCiteRegEx": "Caliskan et al\\.", "year": 2017}, {"title": "Tractable semi-supervised learning of complex structured prediction models", "author": ["Kai-Wei Chang", "S.

Structured prediction models are used in these tasks to take advantage of correlations between co-occurring labels and visual input but risk inadvertently encoding social biases found in web corpora. In this work, we study data and models associated with multilabel object classification and visual semantic role labeling. We find that (a) datasets for these tasks contain significant gender bias and (b) models trained on these datasets further amplify existing bias. For example, the activity cooking is over 33% more likely to involve females than males in a training set, and a trained model further amplifies the disparity to 68% at test time. We propose to inject corpus-level constraints for calibrating existing structured prediction models and design an algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation for collective inference. Our method results in almost no performance loss for the underlying recognition task but decreases the magnitude of bias amplification by 47.5% and 40.5% for multilabel classification and visual semantic role labeling, respectively.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
