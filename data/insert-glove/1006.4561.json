Therefore, the similarity identification between ontologies being used becomes a mandatory task for all these processes to handle the problem of semantic heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose an efficient technique for similarity measurement between two ontologies. The proposed technique identifies all candidate pairs of similar concepts without omitting any similar pair. The proposed technique can be used in different types of operations on ontologies such as merging, mapping and aligning. By analyzing its results a reasonable improvement in terms of completeness, correctness and overall quality of the results has been found.\nIndex Terms - Ontology Alignment, Semantic Web, Ontology Heterogeneity\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014"}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "It is quite difficult to retrieve relevant information from current web due to semantic heterogeneity problem in addition to other problems. Semantic web suggested solution of retrieval of specific information through ontologies, but ontologies may themselves suffer the heterogeneity problem when they are integrated, merged, shared, etc [1]. Same concept may be given different names or may be defined in different ways in two ontologies, although both ontologies belong to the same domain and may overlap. In order to use them together for different purposes such as merging, integrating, querying or even in creating a new ontology, those need to be aligned [2]. There are several techniques for aligning ontologies. They are mainly grouped into two classes: schema-based techniques and instance-based techniques. In schemabased techniques, the similarity among concepts of both ontologies is measured at structure-level while ignoring their actual data, whereas in instance-level techniques the similarity decision is made by taking actual data into consideration [3]. Ontology alignment at schema-level has different classifications such as structural, semantic, terminological and extensional [4]. Techniques for structural alignment are further divided into two classes: External structural alignment techniques and internal structural alignment techniques. External structure of a concept consists of the following elements [2], [5], [6]: super concepts; sub-concepts, sibling concepts and its nonAmjad\u00a0Farooq,\u00a0Syed\u00a0Ahsan\u00a0 and\u00a0Abad\u00a0Shah:\u00a0Computer\u00a0Science\u00a0 and\u00a0 Engineering\u00a0 Department,\u00a0 University\u00a0 of\u00a0 Engineering\u00a0 and\u00a0 Technology,\u00a0Lahore\u00a0\u2013Pakistan.\u00a0 taxonomic relations with the concepts. Therefore, when a concept Ci of ontology A is aligned with a concept Cj of ontology B, then all these elements i.e. super, sub and siblings are taken into consideration in the externalstructure level alignment of a concept. Structure-level similarities between concepts of ontologies are computed using different criteria [7],[8], [9], [10] such as their direct super-entities (or all of their super-entities) are already similar; their sibling-entities (or all of their siblingentities) are already similar; their direct sub-entities (or all of their sub-entities) are already similar; all (or most) of their descendant-entities (entities in the sub-tree rooted at the entity in question) are already similar; all (or most) of their leaf-entities (entities, which have no sub-entity, in the sub-tree rooted at the entity in question) are already similar and all (or most) of entities in the paths from the root to the entities in question are already similar. While aligning different ontologies using criteria as mentioned above, we observe that certain pairs of similar concepts remain unaligned because those concepts don\u2019t satisfy these criteria .e. their respective surrounding concepts are not similar. Secondly, the matching process should be made at domain vocabulary declaration level, to make it more generic, simple and efficient. Since domain vocabulary is the foundation of ontology, therefore it is easy and efficient to make an alignment between domain vocabularies of two ontologies. In the alignment process, first domain vocabularies of both ontologies are enriched by equipping each domain concept with its possible synonyms and then the similarities between concepts of both vocabularies are determined and formalized. Finally, both ontologies may be adapted accordingly.\n\u00a9 2010 Journal of Computing\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/journalofcomputing/\nOur proposed technique computes the similarity between concept Ci of Ontology A and concept Cj of ontology B, based on the criteria: (i) At least one of the super-concepts of Ci and Cj must be similar; (ii) Similarity between subconcepts of Ci and Cj is optional; (iii) Similarity between siblings of Ci and Cj is optional; (iv) Similarity between non-taxonomic relations of both concepts in their ontologies is also optional. However, to rank the level of similarity between those concepts or to measure their granularity level the options (ii), (iii) and (iv) may be considered. Our proposed technique is more generic, simple and efficient because when two ontologies are aligned using this technique, none of similar pair of concepts remains unaligned. However existing techniques may leave some similar concepts unaligned. Moreover, the computing of optional similarities such as for sub-concepts, sibling concepts and non-taxonomic relations of both concepts involved in similarity computing process are omitted in this technique. The remaining paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 an overview of some existing techniques is given. The proposed technique is given in Section 3 and it is illustrated by a case study in Section 4. The results generated through our technique and some existing techniques are compared in the same Section. Finally, the paper is concluded with future work in Section 5."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "Semantic web heavily relies on ontologies. When ontologies need to be merged, integrated, queried and are used for knowledge sharing, their heterogeneity becomes bottleneck. To resolve this problem these need to be aligned [3, 9]. For alignment, the semantic similarities among the concepts of ontologies are determined. While determining similarities; the semantics, structural, taxonomical and contextual perspectives of concepts are taken into consideration [5]. The structure-level techniques for ontology alignment compare similarity of concepts based on different criteria as listed in previous Section. According to [8], two concepts are similar if their direct super-entities are similar. In [11],[12],[13],[14] it is stated that two concepts are similar if their direct super-entities are similar, their sibling-entities are similar; their direct sub-entities are similar; their descendant-entities are similar; their leaf-entities are similar and entities in the paths from the root to those concepts are similar. In [15], the structural similarity between two concepts is computed from the average similarity of their respective super and sub-concepts. The super and sub concepts of two concepts being compared are fetched into separate sets and then the resultant similarity is computed from the similarities of concepts in those sets. If both the super and sub concepts similarity are undefined, then the concepts\nbeing compared are declared as dissimilar otherwise they are declared similar concepts. These techniques need to be more generic because for certain scenario these techniques are not suitable. For example, concepts of two ontologies are still similar (see\nFig. 6 and Fig 8 in Sec. 4), although their super concepts, sibling-concepts, sub-concepts, descendent-concepts, leafconcepts and concepts from root to those concepts are not similar. Furthermore, it is recommended that structural equality is not sufficient for measuring the alignment. Instead the concepts should be aligned on the basis of their semantics equality [15]. We think that these criteria should be more generic for computing similarities in two concepts."}, {"heading": "3. PROPOSED TECHNIQUE", "text": "As mentioned earlier that our proposed technique computes the similarity between concepts of two ontologies based on criteria. At least one super-concept from both concepts involved in the matching process must be similar. There is no need of finding similarity between sub-concepts, siblings and their interactions with other concepts in their respective ontologies. Here we include only algorithm for extracting super-concepts and their matching. Algorithms for matching the siblings-concepts, sub-concepts and other interacting objects of both concepts involved in similarity measuring process are omitted here because according to our proposed criteria, all these are optional. However to rank the level of similarity, we are also working on these aspects. Our proposed technique works in three steps: (i) Concepts Extraction (ii) Super-concepts Extraction (iii) Matching. This technique works with assumption that both ontologies are defined in Web Ontology Language (OWL) [16].\nStep 1: Concepts Extraction As stated earlier, only concepts are involved in alignment process based on external-structure whereas properties are involved in internal-structure alignment process. Therefore we extract concepts only and there is no need of extracting properties. Both source and target ontologies involved in alignment process are parsed and the concepts presented in \u201cowl:CLASS\u201d tag are extracted for determining their similarities. This step is very simple. Two vectors VA and VB are declared and then are populated from concepts of ontologies A and B respectively.\nStep 2: Super-Concepts Extraction Since the proposed criterion is based on the comparison of super-concepts for both concepts involved in the matching process, therefore for both ontologies we need all super-concepts of each concept extracted in previous step. Working of this step in pseudo form is given in Fig 1. Vectors named as CSA (Concepts along with Super-concepts of ontology\n\u00a9 2010 Journal of Computing\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/journalofcomputing/\nA) and CSB(Concepts along with Super-concepts of ontology B) are obtained as output of this step.\nStep 3: Matching We claim that ontology alignment based on similarities of external structure of concepts need only the similarity of at least on super-concept (immediate is not necessarily) from both concepts involved in matching process. Therefore in this step, each super-concept of cA presented in VA is compared with each super-concept of cBi for all 1\u2264 i\u2265 n. If there is a match between any super-concept of cA and any super-concept of cB then both cA and cB are declared similar concepts. A working of matching process in pseudo form is repented in Fig 2. The output e.g. SimilarPair Vector will consist of only those pairs of concepts having similarities from both ontolgies."}, {"heading": "4. CASE STUDY", "text": "The evaluation of proposed technique was performed automatically and manually with three test cases: (a) Both the source ontology A and the target ontology B belongs to same domain but are developed separately with different viewpoints. (b) Both the source ontology A and the target ontology B belongs to different domains with no similarity. (c)Using same ontology as the source ontology A and the target ontology B. The algorithms listed in the previous section were implemented in Java programming language. A pair of ontologies developed by different persons were used for evaluation. In first pair (see Fig.3), both ontologies were about \u201cResearch Activities\u201d domain conducted in a university. Workings of proposed technique were also traced manually, using same pairs of ontologies. Then the results obtained through automatically and manually were compared with each other and with expected results mentioned by respective domains experts.

According to [11,12,13], (c2_A, c2_B) and (c3_A, c3_B) are not similar because their leaf-entities are not similar and entities in the paths from the root to these concepts are not similar.Whereas according to our proposed criterion (c1_A, c1_B),(c1_A, c1_B) and (c1_A, c1_B) are similar and allthese concepts are actually similar, determined through manual matching and with results provided by respective domain experts.\n\u00a9 2010 Journal of Computing\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/journalofcomputing/\n\u00a9 2010 Journal of Computing\nhttp://sites.google.com/site/journalofcomputing/\nTo further verify proposed technique we have taken two independent ontologies C and D of Student domain, created by different groups.

Results with respect to existing approaches:\n According to [8], (Ci_C, Cj_D) is not similar because their direct super-entities are not similar.\n According to [11],[17],[18], (Ci_C, Cj_D) is not similar because their sub-entities are not similar and their siblingentities are not similar.\n According to [11],[20],[21], (Ci_C, Cj_D) is not similar because their leaf-entities are not similar and entities in the paths from the root to these concepts are not similar. Whereas according to our proposed technique (Ci_C, Cj_D) is similar and these concepts are actually similar, determined through manual matching and from respective domain experts.

"Ontologies usually suffer from the semantic heterogeneity when simultaneously used in information sharing, merging, integrating and querying processes. Therefore, the similarity identification between ontologies being used becomes a mandatory task for all these processes to handle the problem of semantic heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose an efficient technique for similarity measurement between two ontologies. The proposed technique identifies all candidate pairs of similar concepts without omitting any similar pair. The proposed technique can be used in different types of operations on ontologies such as merging, mapping and aligning. By analyzing its results a reasonable improvement in terms of completeness, correctness and overall quality of the results has been", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
