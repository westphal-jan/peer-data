Introdu tion\nThe NK lands ape is a tness lands ape model devised by Kau man (1989). An appealing property of the NK lands ape is that the \\ruggedness\" of the lands ape an be tuned by hanging some parameters. Over the years, the NK lands ape model itself has been studied from the perspe tives of statisti s and omputational omplexity (Weinberger, 1996; Wright, Thompson, & Zhang, 2000). In the study of geneti algorithms, NK lands ape models have been used as a prototype and ben hmark in the analysis of the performan e of di erent geneti operators and the e e ts of di erent en oding methods on the algorithm's performan e (Altenberg, 1997; Hordijk, 1997; Jones, 1995).\nIn the eld of ombinatorial sear h and optimization, one of the interesting dis overies is the threshold phenomena and phase transitions. Roughly speaking, a phase transition in\nombinatorial sear h refers to the phenomenon that the probability that a random instan e of the problem has a solution drops abruptly from 1 to 0 as the order parameter of the random model rosses a riti al value alled the threshold. Closely related to this phase transition in solubility is the hardness of solving the problems. There has been strong empiri al eviden e and theoreti al arguments showing that the hardest instan es of the problems usually o ur around the threshold and instan es generated with parameters far away from the threshold are relatively easy. Sin e the seminal work of Cheeseman et al. (Cheeseman, Kanefsky, & Taylor, 1991), many NP- omplete ombinatorial sear h problems have been shown to have the phase transition and the asso iated easy-hard-easy pattern (Cook & Mit hell, 1997; Culberson & Gent, 2001; Freeman, 1996; Gent, Ma Intyre, Prosser, &\n2002 AI A ess Foundation and Morgan Kaufmann Publishers. All rights reserved.\nWalsh, 1998; Kirkpatri k & Selman, 1994; Mit hell, Selman, & Levesque, 1992; Vandegriend & Culberson, 1998).\nIn this paper, we analyze the NK lands ape model from the perspe tive of threshold phenomena and phase transitions. We establish two random models for the de ision problem of NK lands apes and study the threshold phenomena and the asso iated hardness of the phase transitions in these two models.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Se tion 2, we introdu e the NK tness lands ape and our probabilisti models, the uniform probability model and the xed ratio model. In Se tion 3 and Se tion 4, the threshold phenomena and phase transitions in NK lands apes are analyzed. For the uniform probability model, we prove that the phase transition of the uniform probability model is easy in the sense that there is a polynomial algorithm that an solve a random instan e of the problem with the probability asymptoti to 1 as the problem size tends to in nity. For the xed ratio model, we establish two upper bounds for the solubility threshold, and prove that random instan es with parameters above these upper bounds an be solved polynomially. This, together with our empiri al study for random instan es generated below and in the phase transition region, suggests that the phase transition of the xed ratio model is also easy. In Se tion 5, we report our experimental results on typi al hardness of the xed ratio model. In Se tion 6, we on lude our investigation and dis uss impli ations of our results.\n2. NK Lands apes and their Probabilisti Models\nAn NK lands ape f(x) =\nn\nP\ni=1\nf\ni\n(x\ni\n; (x\ni\n)); is a real-valued fun tion de ned on binary strings\nof xed length, where n > 0 is a positive integer and x = (x\n1\n; ; x\nn\n) 2 f0; 1g\nn\n. It is the sum\nof n lo al tness fun tions f\ni\n; 1 i n. Ea h lo al tness fun tion f\ni\n(x\ni\n; (x\ni\n)) depends\non the main variable x\ni\nand its neighborhood (x\ni\n) P\nk\n(fx\n1\n; ; x\nn\ngnfx\ni\ng) where P\nk\n(X)\ndenotes the set of all subsets of size k from X. The most important parameters of an NK lands ape are the number of variables n, and the size of the neighborhood k = j (x\ni\n)j.\nIn an NK lands ape, the neighborhood (x\ni\n) an be hosen in two ways: the random\nneighborhood, where the k variables are randomly hosen from the set fx\n1\n; ; x\nn\ngnfx\ni\ng;\nand the adja ent neighborhood, where k variables with indi es nearest to i (modulo n) are\nhosen. For example, for any even integer k, the k variables in (x\ni\n) an be de ned as\nx\n((n+i\nk 2 ) mod n)\n; ; x\n((n+i+\nk 2 ) mod n)\n: On e the variables in the neighborhood are deter-\nmined, the lo al tness fun tion f\ni\nis determined by a tness lookup table whi h spe i es\nthe fun tion value f\ni\nfor ea h of the 2\nk+1\npossible assignments to the variables x\ni\nand (x\ni\n).\nThroughout this paper, we onsider NK lands apes with random neighborhoods. To simplify the dis ussion, we further assume that the lo al tness fun tions take on binary values. Given an NK lands ape f , the orresponding de ision problem is stated as follows: Is the maximum of f(x) equal to n? An NK lands ape de ision problem is insoluble if there is no solution for it.\nIt has been proved that the NK lands ape model is NP omplete for k 2 (e.g., Weinberger, 1996; Wright et al., 2000). The proofs were based on a redu tion from SAT to the de ision problem of NK lands apes. To study the typi al hardness of the NK lands ape de ision problems in the framework of thresholds and phase transitions, we introdu e two\nrandom models. In both of the models de ned below, the neighborhood set (x\ni\n) of a\nvariable x\ni\nis sele ted by randomly hoosing without repla ement k = j (x\ni\n)j variables\nfrom xnfx\ni\ng.\nDe nition 2.1. The Uniform Probability Model N(n; k; p): In this model, the tness value of the lo al tness fun tion f\ni\n(x\ni\n; (x\ni\n)) is determined as follows: For ea h assignment\ny 2 Dom(f\ni\n) = f0; 1g\nk+1\n, let f\ni\n(y) = 0 with the probability p and f\ni\n(y) = 1 with the\nprobability 1 p, where this is done for ea h possible assignment and ea h lo al tness fun tion independently.\nDe nition 2.2. The Fixed Ratio Model N(n; k; z): In this model, the parameter z takes on values from [0; 2 k+1 \u2104. If z is an integer, we spe ify the lo al tness fun tion f\ni\n(x\ni\n; (x\ni\n))\nby randomly hoosing without repla ement z tuples of possible assignments Y = (y\n1\n; ; y\nz\n)\nfrom Dom(f\ni\n) = f0; 1g\nk+1\n, and de ning the lo al tness fun tion as follows:\nf\ni\n(y) =\n0; if y 2 Y ; 1; else:\nFor a non-integer z = (1 )[z\u2104 + [z + 1\u2104 where [z\u2104 is the integer part of z, we hoose randomly without repla ement [(1 )n\u2104 lo al tness fun tions and determine their tness values a ording to N(n; k; [z\u2104). The rest of the lo al tness fun tions are determined a -\nording to N(n; k; [z\u2104 + 1).\nIn the theory of random graphs, there are two related random models G(n; p) where\nea h of the\nn(n 1)\n2\npossible edges is in luded in the graph independently with probability\np, and G(n;m) where exa tly m edges are hosen randomly and without repla ement from\nthe set of\nn(n 1)\n2\npossible edges. It is well known that for most of the monotone graph\nproperties, results proved in G(n; p) (or G(n;m)) also hold asymptoti ally for G(n;Np)\n( orrespondingly, G(n;\nm N )) where N =\nn(n 1)\n2\n. However, we annot expe t that similar\nrelations exist between the two random models of NK lands apes de ned above unless the parameter k tends to in nity. As a result, the asymptoti behaviors of the two NK lands ape models are signi antly di erent for xed k.\nWe on lude this se tion by establishing a relation between the de ision problem of NK\nlands apes and the SAT problem. A de ision problem of the NK lands ape\nf(x) =\nn\nX\ni=1\nf\ni\n(x\ni\n; (x\ni\n));\n\\is the maximum of f(x) equal or greater than n?\", an be redu ed to a (k+1)-SAT problem as follows:\n(1) For ea h lo al tness fun tion f\ni\n(x\ni\n; (x\ni\n)), onstru t a onjun tion C\ni\n=\nz\nV\nj=1\nC\nj i\nof lauses with exa tly k + 1 variable-distin t literals from the set of variables fx\ni\n; (x\ni\n)g,\nwhere z is the number of zero values that f\ni\ntakes and C\nj i is su h that for any assignment\ny\nj\n2 f0; 1g\nk+1\nthat falsi es C\nj i , we have f i (y j ) = 0.\n(2) The (k+1)-SAT is the onjun tion ' =\nn V\ni=1\nC\ni\n.\nTable 1 shows an example of the tness assignment of a lo al tness fun tion f\ni\n= f\ni\n(x; y; z)\nand its asso iated equivalent 3-SAT lauses. It is easy to see that for any assignment s to the variables x; y; z, f\ni\n(s) = 1 if and only if the assignment satis es the formula\nx _ y _ z; x _ y _ z; x _ y _ z; x _ y _ z:\n3. Analysis of The Uniform Probability Model\nIn the uniform probability model N(n; k; p), the parameter p determines how many zero values a lo al tness fun tion an take. We are interested in how the solubility and hardness of the NK lands ape de ision problem hange as the parameter p in reases from 0 to 1. It turns out that for xed p > 0, the de ision problem is asymptoti ally trivially insoluble. This is quite similar to the phenomena in the random models of the onstraint satisfa tion problem observed by A hlioptas et al. (1997).\nTo gain some more insight into the problem, we onsider the ase where p = p(n) is a\nfun tion of the problem size n with lim\nn\np(n) = 0. Our analysis shows that the solubility of\nthe problem depends on how fast p(n) de reases:\n(1) If\nlim\nn\np(n)n\n1\n2\nk+1\n= +1; (3.1)\nthe problem is still asymptoti ally trivially insoluble be ause with the probability asymptoti to 1, there is at least one lo al tness fun tion that always has a tness value 0;\n(2) On the other hand if p(n) de reases fast enough, i.e.,\nlim\nn\np(n)n\n1\n2\nk+1\n< +1; (3.2)\nthe problem an be de omposed into a set of independent sub-problems. In either ase the problem an be solved in polynomial time. The ase of (3.1) is not di\u00c6 ult to prove, but to prove the ase of (3.2), we need to make use of the following on epts and results.\nDe nition 3.1. The onne tion graph of an NK lands ape instan e f(x) =\nn\nP\ni=1\nf\ni\n(x\ni\n; (x\ni\n))\nis a graph G = G(V;E) satisfying\n(1) Ea h vertex v 2 V orresponds to a lo al tness fun tion; and (2)There is an edge between v\ni\n; v\nj\nif and only if the orresponding lo al tness fun tions\nf\ni\n; f\nj\nshare variables, i.e., the neighborhoods (x\ni\n) and (x\nj\n) of x\ni\nand x\nj\nhave a non-empty\ninterse tion, and both of them have at least one zero value.\nDe nition 3.2. Let f(x) =\nn\nP\ni=1\nf\ni\n(x\ni\n; (x\ni\n)) be an NK lands ape instan e with the on-\nne tion graph G = G(V;E). Let G\n1\n; ; G\nl\nbe the onne ted omponents of G. Sin e the\nverti es of G orrespond to lo al tness fun tions, we an regard G\ni\nas a set of lo al tness\nfun tions. For ea h 1 i l, let U\ni\nx = (x\n1\n; ; x\nn\n) be the set of variables that appear\nin the de nition of the lo al tness fun tions in G\ni\n.\nIt is easy to see that (U\n1\n; U\nl\n) ex luding independent verti es forms a disjoint partition\nof (a subset of) the variables x = (x\n1\n; ; x\nn\n), and that the lo al tness fun tions in G\ni\nonly depend on the variables in U\ni\n. Furthermore, the NK de ision problem is soluble if and\nonly if for ea h 1 i l, there is an assignment s\ni\n2 f0; 1g\njU\ni\nj\nto the variables in U\ni\nsu h\nthat for ea h lo al tness fun tion g 2 G\ni\n, g(s) = 1.\nTheorem 3.1 summarizes the result on the uniform probability model.\nTheorem 3.1. For any p(n) su h that lim\nn\np(n)n\n1\n2\nk+1\nexists, k xed,there is a polynomial\ntime algorithm that su essfully solves a random instan e of N(n; k; p) with probability asymptoti to 1 as n tends to in nity.\nProof: We onsider two ases: lim\nn\np(n)n\n1\n2\nk+1\n= +1 and lim\nn\np(n)n\n1\n2\nk+1\n< +1.\n(1) The ase of lim\nn\np(n)n\n1\n2\nk+1\n= +1.\nLet A\ni\nbe the event that f\ni\n(y) = 0 for ea h possible assignment y 2 f0; 1g\nk+1\nand let\nA =\nn S\ni=1\nA\ni\nbe the event that at least one of the A\ni\n's o urs. We have\nlim\nn!1\nPrfAg = 1 lim\nn!1\nPrf\nn\n\\\ni=1\nA\ni\ng\n= 1 lim\nn!1\n(1 p(n)\n2\nk+1\n)\nn\n:\nIt an be shown that if k is xed and lim\nn\np(n)n\n1\n2\nk+1\n= +1, then lim\nn!1\nPrfAg = 1. It follows\nthat with probability asymptoti to one, there is at least one lo al tness fun tion whi h takes on values 0 for any possible assignments. We an therefore show that in this ase, the NK de ision problem is insoluble by he king the lo al tness fun tions one by one. And this only takes linear time.\n(2) The ase of lim\nn\np(n)n\n1\n2\nk+1\n< +1.\nConsider an algorithm that rst nds the onne ted omponents G\ni\n; 1 i l of the\nonne tion graph G of the NK model, and then uses brute for e to nd an assignment\ns\ni\n2 f0; 1g\njU\ni\nj\nto the variables in U\ni\nsu h that for ea h lo al tness fun tion g 2 G\ni\n,\ng(s) = 1. The time omplexity of this algorithm is O(n\n2\n+n 2\nM(n;k;p)\n) whereM(n; k; p) =\nmax(jU\ni\nj; 1 i l) is the maximum size of the subsets (U\ni\n; 1 i l) asso iated with the\nonne ted omponents of the onne tion graph. To prove the theorem, we only need to show\nthat M(n; k; p) 2 O(log n). In the following, we will show that for lim\nn\np(n)n\n1\n2\nk+1\n< +1,\nwe have\nlim\nn!1\nPrfM(n; k; p) 2\nk\n+ 2g = 1\nConsider the onne tion graph G = G(V;E) of the NK model. It is a random graph and there is an edge between two nodes if and only if the two orresponding lo al tness fun tions share variables and both of the lo al tness fun tions take at least one zero as their tness value. However, under this de nition the edge probabilities are not independent. If vx 2 E then we know that f\nx\nhas at least one zero and so the probability that xw is in E is greater\nthan if there were no other edge on x.\nTo deal with this we resort to the following proof onstru tion. Let C\nm\n= fv\n1\n; : : : ; v\nm\ng\nbe a subset of V of size m. Let be an ordering (permutation) of v\n1\n: : : v\nm\n. We say that\nC\nm\nis variable onne ted with respe t to the ordering , denoted as C(C\nm\n; ), if for ea h\ni; 2 i m there is either\n1. a j < i su h that f\n(j)\nand f\n(i)\nshare a variable; or\n2. a j; 1 j i su h that the variable x\nj\nis one of the k random variables in f\ni\n.\nLemma If the indu ed subgraph G[C\nm\n\u2104 is onne ted then there exists at least one ordering\nof v\n1\n: : : v\nm\nsu h that C(C\nm\n; ).\nAs proof, onsider the ordering of verti es of any depth rst sear h of a onne ted\nsubgraph. In this ase, the onne tions are all by ase 1.\nThe expe ted number of permutations for whi h C(C\nm\n; ) is\nE = E[jf : C(C\nm\n; )gj\u2104 = m!PrfC(C\nm\n; )g\nWe then observe that the expe ted number of onne ted indu ed graphs on m verti es is less than p m\n0\nn m E , where p 0 is the probability that f i takes at least one value zero. We\nshow this value goes to zero in the limit if m 2\nk\n+2. Finally, sin e if there is a onne ted\nsubgraph on m verti es then there must be one for ea h i < m, it follows that the largest\nonne ted omponent has size at most 2\nk\n+ 1.\nFor a randomly generated permutation of C\nm\n, let C\ni\nbe the set of the rst i verti es\nof the permutation. For i 2 de ne P\ni\nto be the probability that f\n(i)\nshares at least one\nvariable with f\n(j)\nfor some j < i given that C(C\ni 1\n; =1; ; i 1). Let P\n1\n= 1. (A one\nvertex subgraph is always onne ted.)\nFor i > 1 we have P\ni\n= Prf9j < i; f\n(i)\nand f\n(j)\nshare variables, given C(C\ni 1\n; ) or\none of the k random variables in f\n(i)\nis in fx\n1\n: : : x\nm\ng fx\ni\ngg.\nPrfC(C\nm\n; )g =\nm\nY\ni=2\nP\ni\n:\nFinally, for i > 1 we note that C\ni 1\nhas at most (i 1)k distin t other variables. If C\ni 1\nis onne ted then the number of variables may be less than this. Thus,\nP\ni\n1\nn k(i 1) m\nk\nn 1\nk\n:\nThe ombinatorial part redu es to\n(n k(i 1) m) : : : (n k(i 1) m k + 1)\n(n 1) : : : (n k)\nn ki m+ 1\nn 1\nk\n:\nSo, PrfC(C\nm\n; )g is\nm\nY\ni=2\n1\nn ki m+ 1\nn 1\nk\n!\n1\n1\nkm+m 2\nn 1\nk\n!\nm 1\n2 O\n1\nn\nm 1\n!\n;m; k xed.\nNoting that p\nm 0 2 O n\nm\n2\nk\n+1\n, we see that the expe ted number of onne ted subgraphs of\nsize m is bounded by\np\nm 0\nn\nm\nE 2 O n\nm\nn\nm\n2\nk\n+1\n1\nn\nm 1\n!\nwhi h goes to zero ifm = 2\nk\n+2. It follows thatM(n; k; p) is less than 2\nk\n+2 with probability\nasymptoti to 1. This ompletes the proof.\n4. Analysis of The Fixed Ratio Model\nAs has been dis ussed in the previous se tion, the uniform probability model N(n; k; p) of NK lands apes is asymptoti ally trivial. Part of the ause of this asymptoti triviality lies in the fa t that if the parameter p does not de rease very qui kly with n, then asymptoti ally there will be at least one lo al tness fun tion that takes the value 0 for all the possible assignments, making the whole de ision problem insoluble. In this se tion, we study the\nxed ratio model N(n; k; z). In this model, we require that ea h lo al tness fun tion has xed number of zero values so that the trivially insoluble situation in the uniform probability model is avoided. We note that the same idea has been used in the study of the awless CSP (Gent et al., 1998).\nRe all that in the xed ratio model, we hoose the neighborhood stru ture for ea h lo al tness in the same way as in the uniform probability model N(n; k; p). To determine the tness value for a lo al tness fun tion f\ni\n, we randomly without repla ement sele t exa tly\nz tuples fs\n1\n; ; s\nz\ng from f0; 1g\nk+1\n, and let f\ni\n(s\nj\n) = 0 for ea h 1 j z and f\ni\n(s) = 1 for\nevery other s 2 f0; 1g\nk+1\n.\nFor the xed ratio model, we are interested in how the probability of an instan e of\nN(n; k; z) being soluble hanges as the parameter z in reases from 0 to 2\nk+1\n. It is easy to\nsee that the property \\There exists an assignment x su h that f(x) =\nn\nP\ni=1\nf\ni\n(x\ni\n; (x\ni\n)) = n\"\nis monotone in the parameter z| the number of tuples at whi h a lo al tness fun tion takes zero. A tually, we have the following Lemma on the property of the solubility probability of the xed ratio model:\nLemma 4.1. For the xed ratio model, if z\n1\n> z\n2\n, then\nPrfN(n; k; z\n1\n)is solubleg PrfN(n; k; z\n2\n)is solubleg:\nFurthermore, we have\nPrfN(n; k; z)is solubleg =\n1; if z 1; 0; if z = 2 k+1 :\nBased on the above Lemma and in parallel to the study of the threshold phenomena in other random ombinatorial stru tures su h as 3-Coloring of random graphs and random 3-SAT, we suggest the following onje ture:\nConje ture 4.1. There exists a threshold z su h that\nlim\nn!1\nPrfN(n; k; z)is solubleg =\n1; if z < z ; 0; if z > z :\nConje tures like this are the starting point of the study of phase transition in many random ombinatorial stru tures su h as 3- oloring of random graphs and random SAT, but the existen e of the thresholds is still an open question (A hlioptas, 1999; Cook & Mit hell, 1997). However, bounding the thresholds has been an important topi in the study of phase transition (A hlioptas, 1999, 2001; Dubois, 2001; Fran o & Gelder, 1998; Fran o & Paul, 1983; Frieze & Suen, 1996; Kirousis, P.Kranakis, D.Krizan , & Y.Stamation, 1994). In this se tion, we will establish two upper bounds on the threshold of the parameter z , and theoreti ally prove that random instan es generated with the parameter z above these upper bounds an be solved with probability asymptoti to 1 by polynomial (even linear) algorithms.\nChara terizing the sharpness of the thresholds is also of great interest in the study of the phase transition. After proving that every monotone graph property has a threshold behavior (Friedgut & Kalai, 1996), Friedgut (1999) established a ne essary and su\u00c6 ient\nondition for a monotone graph property to have sharp threshold, whi h has been used to prove the sharpness of the thresholds of 3- olorability and 3-SAT problems (Friedgut, 1999; A hlioptas, 1999). For the xed ratio model dis ussed in this paper, we suspe t that it will exhibit a oarse threshold behavior, and would like to leave a detailed investigation into this problem as a future resear h dire tion.\n4.1 The Upper Bound of z = 3:0\nThe derivation of this upper bound is based on the on ept of a on i ting pair of lo al\ntness fun tions. We say that two lo al tness fun tions f\ni\nand f\nj\non i t with ea h other\nif\n1. f\ni\nand f\nj\nshare at least one variable x; and\n2. For any assignment s 2 f0; 1g\nn\n, we have f\ni\n(s)f\nj\n(s) = 0.\nIt is obvious that an instan e of the NK de ision problem is insoluble if there exists a pair of on i ting lo al tness fun tions.\nBased on the se ond moment method in the theory of probability (Alon & Spen er, 1992), we an prove the following upper bound result. As it takes linear time to he k if there is a pair of on i ting lo al tness fun tions, we an see that the xed ratio model N(n; 2; z) is linearly solvable when z > 3:0.\nTheorem 4.1.

This also gives us a polynomial time algorithm whi h determines that N(n; 2; z) is insoluble with probability asymptoti to 1 for z > 2:837.\nRe all from Se tion 2 that ea h instan e of N(n; 2; z) has an equivalent 3-SAT instan e. The idea is to show that with probability asymptoti to 1, an instan e of N(n; 2; z) will\nontain a set of spe ially stru tured 3- lauses, alled a t-3-module (De nition 10.3, Fran o\n& Gelder, 1998):\nM = fM\n1\n; : : : ;M\n3p+2\ng; t = 3p+ 2;\nwhere\nM\n1\n= ( u\n1\n_ u\n2\n_ z\n1\n; u\n1\n_ u\n2\n_ z\n1\n);\nM\np 1\n= ( u\np 1\n_ u\np\n_ z\np 1\n; u\np 1\n_ u\np\n_ z\np 1\n);\nM\np\n= ( u\np\n_ u\n0\n_ z\np\n; u\np\n_ u\n0\n_ z\np\n);\nM\np+1\n= ( u\np+1\n_ u\np+2\n_ z\np+1\n; u\np+1\n_ u\np+2\n_ z\np+1\n);\nM\n3p 1\n= ( u\n3p 1\n_ u\n3p\n_ z\n3p 1\n; u\n3p 1\n_ u\n3p\n_ z\n3p 1\n);\nM\n3p\n= ( u\n3p\n_ u\n0\n_ z\n3p\n; u\n3p\n_ u\n0\n_ z\n3p\n)\nM\n3p+1\n= ( u\n0\n_ u\n1\n_ z\n3p+1\n; u\n0\n_ u\n1\n_ z\n3p+1\n);\nM\n3p+2\n= (u\n0\n_ u\np+1\n_ z\n3p+2\n; u\n0\n_ u\np+1\n_ z\n3p+2\n);\nand u\n1\n; ; u\n3p+1\n; z\n1\n; ; z\n3p+1\nare binary variables. Noti e that a t-3-module an be re-\ndu ed to a 2-SAT problem ontaining two ontradi tory y les and hen e is unsatis able.\nThe result is proved in two steps. In the rst step, it is shown that for z > 2:837 the average number of t-3-modules ontained in N(n; 2; z) tends to in nity as n in reases. In the se ond step, we use a result established by Alon and Spen er (1992) on the se ond moment method to prove that for z > 2:837 the probability that N(n; 2; z) ontains at least one t-3-module tends to 1.\nLet us start with the rst step to show that the average number of t-3-modules ontained\nin N(n; 2; z) tends to in nity as n in reases.\nDe nition 4.1. Given a t-3-module M and an NK lands ape instan e f =\nn\nP\ni=1\nf\ni\n; k = 2, a\nsequen e of lo al tness fun tions\ng = (g\n1\n; ; g\nt\n) (f\n1\n; ; f\nn\n)\nis said to be a possible mat h(PM) if for ea h 1 m t, the main variable of g\nm\nis one of\nthe three variables that o ur in the 3-module M\nm\n. A subsequen e (h\n1\n; ; h\nl\n) of a possible\nmat h g is legal if for any 1 m < j l; h\nm\n6= h\nj\n.\nLemma 4.2. Let f(x) =\nn\nP\ni=1\nf\ni\n(x\ni\n; (x\ni\n)) be an instan e of N(n; 2; z) and M be a t-3-\nmodule. Then the number of possible mat hes for the t-3-module M is 3\nt\n. Further, the\nnumber of legal possible mat hes is\n(\n3+\np\n5\n2\n)\nt\n.\nProof: For ea h 1 m t, there are exa tly 3 possible hoi es for g\nm\n:\nf\ni\n1\n(x\ni\n1\n; (x\ni\n1\n)); f\ni\n2\n(x\ni\n2\n; (x\ni\n2\n)); f\ni\n3\n(x\ni\n3\n; (x\ni\n3\n));\nwhere x\ni\n1\n; x\ni\n2\n; and x\ni\n3\norrespond to the three variables that o ur in the 3-module M\nm\n.\nTherefore, there are 3\nt\npossible mat hes for the t-3-module.\nTo prove the se ond on lusion, we divide the t-3-module into 3 partsM = (M\n1\n;M\n2\n;M\n3\n),\nwhere M\n1\n= (M\nm\n; 1 m p), M\n2\n= (M\nm\n; p + 1 m 3p 1), and M\n3\n=\n(M\n3p\n;M\n3p+1\n;M\n3p+2\n). Letting L\n1\n; L\n2\n; and L\n3\nbe the number of legal possible mat hes for\nM\n1\n;M\n2\n;M\n3\nrespe tively.

To this end, we onsider the probability spa e ( ; P ),\nwhere is the set of sequen es (g\n1\n; ; g\np\n) of lo al tness fun tions that possibly mat hM\n1\nand P is the uniform probability distribution. Then, the number of legal possible mat hes is\nL\n1\n= j j Prfa random sample from is legalg (4.5)\nLet g = (g\n1\n; ; g\np\n) be a random sample from and x\ng\nm\ndenote the main variable of the\nlo al tness fun tion g\nm\n, then we have\nPrfx\ng\nm\n= ju\nm\njg = Prfx\ng\nm\n= ju\nm+1\njg = Prfx\ng\nm\n= jz\nm\njg =\n1\n3\n;\nwhere juj denotes the variable orresponding to the literal u.\nLet B\nm\n; 0 < m p be the event that the rst m lo al tness fun tions g\n1\n; ; g\nm\nin\nthe possible mat h g = (g\n1\n; ; g\np\n) are mutually distin t.

From the de nition of the xed ratio model, g has two zeros in its tness value assignment with probability (1 ), and has three zeros in its tness assignment with probability .

The onditional probability that T\n1\nis implied, is less than or equal to P\n1\n+ P\n2\nwhere\nP\n1\nis the onditional probability that g also implies the lause x_ y_ u given that g implies\nT\n2\n, and P\n2\nis the onditional probability that the lause x _ y _ u is implied by other lo al\ntness fun tions. By the de nition of N(n; 2; z), we have that P\n1\n=\n1 6 . Sin e a lo al tness\nfun tion implies x _ y _ u only if it has the same variables with g = g(jxj; jyj; juj), we have that P\n2\n= O(\n1 n ). The laim is proved.

As before, q\n1\nis the number of 3-modules\nwhose two lauses are both shared and q\n2\n= q q\n1\nthe number of 3-modules that only has\none lause shared. We laim that\njA\nQ;q;q\n2\n(w)j = jA\n2q;q;0\n(w)j6\nq\n2\n: (4.23)\nwhere A\n2q;q;0\n(w) is the set of t-3-modules that share all the 2q lauses in the q 3-modules\nwith w. Let M = fM\n1\n; ;M\nt\ng be a t-3-module in whi h all the lauses M\ni\n; 1 i q\nare shared with w. Let M = fM\n1\n; ;M\nt\ng be a t-3-module in whi h all the lauses in\nM\ni\n; 1 i q\n1\nare shared and ea h of the 3-modules M\ni\n; q\n1\n+ 1 q\n1\n+ q\n2\nhas only one\nlause shared.

The laims follow.

Experiments\nOur study of the threshold phenomena in NK lands apes started with an experimental investigation. Many of the theoreti al results in the previous se tion are motivated by the observations made in our experiments. In this se tion, we des ribe the approa h and methods we used in the experimental study, and report the results and observations we have made.\nIn our experiments, an instan e of the NK lands ape de ision problem is onverted to an equivalent 3-SAT problem, and then the 3-SAT problem is solved using Roberto's relsat|an enhan ed version of the famous Davis-Putnam algorithm for SAT problems implemented in C ++ . The sour e ode of relsat an be found at http://www. s.ub . a/ hoos/SATLIB/.\nIn the experiments, we generated random instan es of the NK lands ape de ision problem from the random model N(n; 2; z). As a result, the equivalent SAT problem for ea h random NK lands ape instan e is a 3-SAT problem with n variables and (on average) zn\nlauses. By de nition, the parameter z is between 0 and 8. For z 1, the 3-SAT instan e an be solved easily by setting the literals that orrespond to the main variables of the lo al tness fun tion to true. As z in reases, we get more and more lauses and the 3-SAT problem be omes more and more onstrained. The aims of the experiments are threefold:(1)Investigating if there exists a threshold phenomenon in the random NK lands ape model; (2) Lo ating the threshold of the parameter z; and (3)Determining if there are any hard instan es around the threshold.\n5.1 Experiments on the Fixed Ratio Model\nIn this part of the experiments, we generate 100 random instan es of N(n; 2; z) for ea h of the parameters n = 2 9 2 16 and z = 2:71; 2:72; ; 3:00. These instan es are then\nonverted to 3-SAT instan es and solved by relsat. Figure 1 shows the fra tion of insoluble instan es as a fun tion of the parameter z. It an be seen that there exists a threshold phenomenon and the threshold is around 2.83. This shows that our upper bound z = 2:837 is very tight.\nIn Figure 2, we plot the square root of the average sear h ost as a fun tion of the\nparameter n. The gure indi ates that the average sear h is in O(n\n2\n) for any parameter\nz. We have also observed that more than 99 per ent of the insoluble instan es are solved qui kly in the prepro essing stage of relsat. This indi ates that there must be some \\small\" stru tures that make the instan es insoluble. More detailed experimental results an be found in Gao's thesis (Gao, 2001).\n5.2 Experiments on the 2-SAT sub-Problem\nThis is the part of the experiments that motivated our theoreti al analyses in Se tion 4.2. The idea an be explained as follows. Let\nf(x) =\nn\nX\ni=1\nf\ni\n(x\ni\n; (x\ni\n))\nbe an instan e of the de ision problem of NK lands ape and\n' = C\n1\n^\nC\n2\n^\nC\nn\nthe equivalent 3-SAT problem where C\ni\nis the set of 3- lauses equivalent to the lo al tness\nfun tion f\ni\n. For ea h i, there is a set of 2- lauses D\ni\n(possibly empty) implied by C\ni\n. For\nexample, if C\ni\nhas three 3- lauses ((x; y; z); (x; y; z); (x; y; z)), then the set of 2- lauses D\ni\nwould be ((x; z); (x; y)). The onjun tion of D\ni\n, denoted by ', is a 2-SAT problem. It is\nobvious that the original 3-SAT problem ' is satis able only if the 2-SAT sub-problem ' is satis able. In the experiment, we generate instan es of the NK lands apeN(n; 2; z), onvert them to the equivalent 3-SAT problems, and extra t the 2-SAT sub-problems. These 2-SAT problems are then solved by the relsat solver. If the 2-SAT problem is unsatis able, then the original NK lands ape instan e is also insoluble.\nThe experimental settings are the same as those in the experiment on the original problem. The results are shown in Figures 3-4, in parallel to the Figures 1-2 of the results on the original 3-SAT problems in Se tion 5.1. We see that the patterns of insoluble fra tions and sear h ost are similar to those we found in the original 3-SAT problems. There is a soluble-insoluble phase transition o urring around 2.83, but the fra tion of unsatis able instan es is lower than the fra tion in the original 3-SAT problems.\nWe also observed that the average sear h ost for the 2-SAT sub-problems remains the same as that for the original 3-SAT problems. This tells us that the di\u00c6 ulty of solving a soluble instan e of NK lands ape is almost the same as that of solving a 2-SAT problem, and hen e is easy. Therefore, on average the NK lands ape N(n; 2; z) is also easy at parameters below the threshold where almost all of the instan es are soluble.\n6. Impli ations and Con lusions\nOne of the questions that arises about this work is its impli ations to the design and analysis of geneti algorithms. NK lands apes were initially on eived as simpli ed models of evolutionary lands apes whi h ould be tuned with respe t to ruggedness and epistati intera tions (Kau man, 1989). In the study of geneti algorithms, NK lands ape models\nhave been used as a prototype and ben hmark in the analysis of the performan e of different geneti operators and the e e ts of di erent en oding methods on the algorithm's performan e (Altenberg, 1997; Hordijk, 1997; Jones, 1995). Kau man (1993) points out that the parameters that primarily a e t a number of ruggedness measures are n and k.\nNevertheless, the fa t that for k 2 the dis rete NK lands ape is NP- omplete (Wright et al., 2000) when the neighbors are arbitrarily hosen ould be onstrued as implying that random lands apes with xed k are in pra ti e hard.\nThe results in this paper should serve as a autionary note that this may not be the ase. Our analyses show that for xed k the uniform probability model is trivially solvable as the problem size tends to in nity. For the xed ratio model, we have derived two upper bounds for the threshold of the solubility phase transition, and proved that the problem with the ontrol parameter above the upper bounds an be solved in polynomial time with probability asymptoti to 1 due to the existen e of easy sub-problems su h as 2-SAT. A series of experiments has also been ondu ted to investigate the hardness of the problem with the ontrol parameters around and below the threshold. From the experiments, we have observed that the problem is also easy around and below the threshold.\nOur proofs hold only for the de ision version of the problem where the omponent fun - tions are dis rete on f0; 1g. The proofs are obtained by noti ing that the lustering of fun tions, or lauses, on sele ted subsets of variables implies that the overall problem is de omposable into independent subproblems, or that the problem ontains small substru - tures that identify the solution. The subproblems are the omponents of the onne tion graph de ned in Se tion 3 and the 2-SAT sub-problems studied in Se tion 4.2. It is urrently un lear to us to what extent our analysis an be extended to the optimization version of the NK model, and we would like to study this problem further in the future.\nIn response to the question `what are the impli ations for GAs?' we suggest the following spe ulative line of enquiry. For the dis rete model we use, the soluble instan es are readily solved by a standard algorithmi approa h based on re ognizing the omponents of the\nonne tion graph. (This should not be a surprise for us as it has been pointed out by He kendorn, Rana, and Whitley (1999) that `Even relatively old algorithms su h as DavisPutnam whi h are deterministi and exa t are orders of magnitude faster than GAs'.) 1 A similar onne tivity an be developed for real valued distributions, for example by apping the minimum value whi h we allow a sub-fun tion to take. We an spe ulate that the\nlustering imposed by xed values of k would also generate lo alized stru tures when real values are applied and when onsidering optimization instead of de ision, but perhaps with fuzzy boundaries. In fa t, this observation is just the ip side of limited epistasis. Geneti algorithms, or their variants su h as the probabilisti model-building algorithms (Larranaga & Lozano, 2001), designed to mimi natural evolution, are supposed to take advantage of this situation. So, to the extent that NK lands apes are an a urate re e tion of the features exploited by evolutionary algorithms, we pose the following question. Is it possible to identify these fuzzy omponents if they exist, and in doing so design an algorithm that exploits the same lands ape features that the evolutionary algorithms do, but far more e\u00c6 iently, as we have done for the uniform dis rete de ision problem?\n1. We thanks an anonymous referee for pointing out to us the work of He kendorn, et al. (He kendorn\net al., 1999)\nThese lands apes were designed with the intent of studying limited intera tions, and our results an also be seen as a on rmation that indeed limited epistasis leads to easier problems. In another domain, that of the more traditional resear h into sear h and optimization, there is a need for test bed problems with real world onne tions whi h are tunable with respe t to di\u00c6 ulty. NK lands apes might have been su h a domain for generating 3-SAT instan es. It is disappointing that for restri ted k the instan es generated are easy with high probability.\nA knowledgments\nThis resear h supported in part by Natural S ien es and Engineering Resear h Coun il Grant No. OGP8053.
