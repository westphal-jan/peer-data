A background to Indian scripts is given in [1]-[6]. Indian scripts are highly systematic in their arrangement of sounds, and the milieu in which they arose is provided in papers on early Indian science [7]-[11]. From the evidence available at this time it may be assumed that the 3 rd millennium BC Indus script evolved into the Brahmi script of late centuries BC which, in turn, evolved into the different Indian modern Scripts. Structurally, all the Indian scripts are thus closely related although their forms may look quite different. The Brahmi script is also the parent to Southeast Asian scripts.\nThe alphabets of Indian languages are classified into consonants, vowels and other symbols. An akshara or syllable consists of 0, 1, 2 or 3 consonants and a vowel or other symbol. Each akshara can be pronounced independently. Alphabets of all the Indian languages are derived from the Brahmi script. In all the Indian languages there are 33 common consonants and 15 common vowels. In addition, there are 3-4 consonants and 2- 3 vowels that are specific to each language, but not very significant in practice. Words are made up of one or more aksharas. If an akshara consists of more than one consonant, they are called samyuktakshara.\nThe similarity in alphabet is not extended in graphical form which is used for printing. Each language uses different scripts, which consists of different graphemes. There are about 10-12 major scripts in India among which Devanagari is the most widely used. Different languages have different statistical characteristics. Some have an over line for the entire word, while some have not touching graphemes. The vowels and the supporting consonants in samyuktakshara can appear on the left, right, above, below or in combinations to the main consonant.\nExamples:\nOver line \u091c\u092e\u094d\u092e\u0942-\u0915\u0936\u094d\u092e\u0940\u0930\nNon Touching \u0c2a\u0c26\u0c4d\u0c2e\u0c35\u0c3f\u0c2d\u0c42\u0c37\u0c23\u0c4d"}, {"heading": "Entropy", "text": "Entropy of the language is the measure of disorder associated with the system.

This can be inferred from both the time taken to read the text and also from the percentage of correctness. The words can be read with much ease if the first and last letters are left in their places.\nThe entropy of Telugu is higher than that of English, which means that Telugu is more succinct than English and each syllable in Telugu (as in other Indian languages) contains more information compared to English. The comparison of entropies of the language for original and jumbled texts confirms that the users can read jumbled text with not much difficulty."}], "references": [{"title": "A frequency analysis of the Indus script", "author": ["S.
