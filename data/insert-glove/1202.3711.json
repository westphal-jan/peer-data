Understanding which variables in a causal system influence which other is crucial for predicting the effects of actions and policies. Learning such relations from observational data is challenging, especially when latent confounders (hidden common causes) and selection bias (affecting the chance of inclusion in the data set) can be present.\nWith the introduction of the FCI algorithm in the seminal work of (Spirtes et al., 2000), it was shown that, under reasonable assumptions, it is indeed possible to infer valid causal information from observed probabilistic independencies in the large sample limit. Subsequent results and contributions from various researchers (Spirtes et al., 1999; Ali et al., 2005; Zhang,\n2008a) have developed this into a method that produces a provably sound and complete output model that captures all identifiable causal information.\nPerhaps surprisingly, this does not mean that the problem of causal discovery from data is now considered \u2018solved\u2019 by the wider research community: the method has trouble handling large models, and worse, in practice the output is often seen as unreliable.\nMost current constraint-based approaches to causal discovery rely on a two step process: a structure identification phase from observed independencies, followed by a (graphical) orientation phase. In real-world data, the large sample limit does not apply, and if one or more incorrect independence decisions are made, then this can lead to a series of erroneous orientations. But this ambiguity is not apparent in the output, severely limiting the interpretability of the entire model, also because there is little or no accountability prospect for any of the causal relations found. Bayesian scorebased methods such as GES (Chickering, 2002) are better suited to deal with this kind of problem, as they can produce multiple output models (Heckerman et al., 1999). However, they have trouble accounting for hidden variables and selection bias, and also suffer from the complexity problem. Would it be possible to give a (complete) characterization of identifiable causal relations, without first building a global structure?\nRelated work\nOne of the first to identify causal relations without recourse to a global structure was Cooper (1997), who presented an algorithm that could infer a causal relation from certain independence relations between three variables, in combination with information that one of these was known to be an uncaused variable. Later Mani et al. (2006) showed that certain independence relations between four variables, corresponding to a so-called embedded Y-structure, indicate the presence of a causal relation without the need for such background knowledge. A different approach to tackle the\nlarge scale complexity was taken by (Spirtes, 2001), who introduced a variant of FCI that could be interrupted at various stages in the inference process, with an output that is correct, but perhaps less informative than if the algorithm had been allowed to complete.\nThe perceived lack of robustness in the graphical orientation phase (due to incorrect independence decisions from limited available data), was addressed by Ramsey et al. (2006) who introduced checks to identify certain inconsistencies in the observed independencies that violate so-called \u2018orientation faithfulness\u2019, and avoid propagating these to the rest of the graph. In a related paper, Zhang and Spirtes (2008) also consider testable instances of adjacency unfaithfulness.\nIn this paper we introduce three rules to convert observed minimal (in)dependencies into logical statements about causal relations. We show that straightforward inference on these logical statements, using standard properties of causality, is sufficient to obtain all identifiable causal information. The result is the first provably sound and complete alternative to the augmented FCI algorithm. As such it generalizes other methods that do not need to build a global independence structure first, and is easily formulated as an anytime algorithm. The fact that the method only requires three simple rules that can be combined in any desired order of occurrence offers hope that this approach can be adapted to improve robustness on real-world data sets as well.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes some standard methods and terminology. Section 3 introduces the logical inference rules. Sections 4 and 5 show these rules are complete. Proofs are provided in the Appendix and in (Claassen and Heskes, 2011)."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Mixed graphical models", "text": "A mixed graph G is a graphical model that can contain three types of edges between pairs of nodes: directed (\u2212\u2192), bi-directed (\u2190\u2192), and undirected (\u2212\u2212). In a mixed graph, standard graph-theoretical notions, e.g. child/parent, ancestor/descendant, directed path, cycle, still apply. So, a vertex Z is a collider on a path u = \u3008. . . , X, Z, Y, . . .\u3009 if there are arrowheads at Z on both edges from X and Y , otherwise it is a noncollider ; if X and Y are not adjacent in G, then the subpath \u3008X, Z, Y \u3009 is unshielded.\nA mixed graph G is ancestral, iff an arrowhead at X on an edge to Y implies there is no directed path from X to Y in G, and there are no arrowheads at nodes with undirected edges. As a result, arrowhead marks\ncan be read as \u2018is not an ancestor of\u2019. In a mixed graph G, a vertex X is m-connected to Y by a path u, relative to a set of vertices Z, iff every noncollider on u is not in Z, and every collider on u is an ancestor of Z. If there is no such path, then X and Y are m-separated by Z. An ancestral graph is maximal (MAG) if for any two non-adjacent vertices there is a set that separates them. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a special kind of MAG, containing only \u2192 edges, for which m-separation reduces to the familiar d -separation criterion. The Markov property links the structure of an ancestral graph G to observed probabilistic independencies: X \u22a5\u22a5 Y |Z, if X and Y are m-separated by Z. Faithfulness implies that the only observed independencies in a system are those entailed by the Markov property. For more details, see (Koller and Friedman, 2009; Spirtes et al., 2000).\nAn important concept is that of a minimal conditional (in)dependence, capturing the notion that really all variables in the minimal set, indicated by brackets, play a role in making two variables (in)dependent:\n- X\u22a5\u22a5Y |W \u222a [Z] \u2261 \u2200Z\u2032( Z : X\u22a5\u22a5 Y |W \u222a Z\u2032, - X\u22a5\u22a5 Y |W \u222a [Z] \u2261 \u2200Z\u2032( Z : X\u22a5\u22a5Y |W \u222a Z\u2032.\nFinally, three path definitions that appear in the orientation rules in the next section: in a MAG, a path u = \u3008X, . . . , W, Z, Y \u3009 is a discriminating path for Z if X is not adjacent to Y , and every node between X and Y is a collider along u, and is a parent of Y . In a PAG P (see below), a path u = \u3008V0, . . . , Vn+1\u3009 is said to be an uncovered potentially directed (p.d.) path, if each successive triple along u is unshielded, and no edge Vi \u2217\u2212\u2217Vi+1 has an arrowhead at Vi or a tail at Vi+1. If all edges on u are of the form \u25e6\u2212\u25e6 , then the path is called an uncovered circle path."}, {"heading": "2.2 Causal models and ancestral graphs", "text": "A popular and intuitive way of representing a causal system is in the form of a causal DAG GC , where the arrows represent direct causal interactions between variables in a system (Pearl, 2000; Zhang, 2008b). We say there is a causal relation X \u21d2 Y , iff there is a directed path from X to Y in GC . Absence of such a path is denoted X \u21d2 Y . The following properties follow readily from this definition\nProposition 1. Causal relations in a DAG GC are:\nirreflexive : X \u21d2 X ` false acyclic : X \u21d2 Y ` Y \u21d2 X transitive : (X \u21d2 Y ) \u2227 (Y \u21d2 Z) ` X \u21d2 Z\nOther definitions are possible, for example we may want to allow for non-recursive relations (feedback) or include threshold effects. Such extensions imply\nthat the causal system is not faithful to a causal DAG, which may impact the conclusions in this article.\nWhen some variables in the causal DAG are hidden, or when there is possible selection bias (Spirtes et al., 1999), the independence relations between the observed variables can be represented in the form of a maximal ancestral graph (Richardson and Spirtes, 2002). Roughly speaking, hidden common causes become bi-directed edges, and selection bias on common effects gives undirected edges. The (complete) partial ancestral graph (PAG) represents all invariant features that characterize the equivalence class [G] of such a MAG, with a tail \u2018\u2212\u2019 or arrowhead \u2018>\u2019 end mark on an edge, iff it is invariant in [G], otherwise it has a circle mark \u2018\u25e6\u2019, see (Zhang, 2008a). Tails in a PAG are associated with identifiable (define?) direct causal relations, and arrowheads with the absence thereof, (Zhang, 2008b). Figure 1 illustrates the relation between these three types of graphs. Note that when selection bias may be present, an invariant arc in a PAG P by itself not necessarily implies a causal relation, e.g. link B \u2212\u2192 F in Figure 1.3). However, if the tail node also has an incoming invariant arrowhead from another node, as for arc E\u2212\u2192F , then it does represent a definite, identifiable causal relation.\nThe challenge of causal discovery from observed independencies is how to identify all these invariant features from a given data set, in order to determine which variables do or do not have a directed path to which others in the underlying causal DAG."}, {"heading": "2.3 Augmented FCI algorithm", "text": "The famous Fast Causal Inference (FCI) algorithm (Spirtes et al., 2000) was one of the first algorithms that was able to validly infer causal relations from conditional independence statements in the large sample limit, even in the presence of latent and selection variables. It consists of an efficient search for a conditional independence between each pair of variables to identify the skeleton of the underlying causal MAG, followed by an orientation stage to identify invariant tail and arrowhead marks. It was shown to be sound in the large sample limit (Spirtes et al., 1999), although not\nyet complete. Ali et al. (2005) proved that the seven graphical orientation rules employed by FCI were sufficient to identify all invariant arrowheads in the equivalence class [G], given a single MAG G. Later, Zhang (2008a) introduced another set of seven rules to orient all remaining invariant tails. Augmented with this set of rules the FCI algorithm is also provably complete.\nLoosely speaking, the augmented FCI algorithm consists of an ingenious adjacency search based on conditional independencies (details of which will not concern us here), to find the skeleton of the PAG P, followed by an orientation phase based on a set of graphical rules, detailed in Table 11. Inspection reveals a certain hierarchy in which rules can trigger which others, reflected in the structure of Algorithm 1.\nStarting from the fully \u25e6\u2212\u25e6 connected graph in line 1, R0a eliminates all edges between conditionally independent nodes to obtain the skeleton of P with only \u25e6\u2212\u25e6 edges (line 4). Then rules R0b-R4b obtain all invariant arrowheads (as well as some tails). Rules R5 \u2212R10 then suffice to identify all and only the remaining invariant tails. For example, in Figure 1, the arrowheads at C from A and B are identified by R0b, and the tailmark at B\u2212\u2192F follows from R9.\n1We follow the numbering from (Zhang, 2008a). The metasymbol \u2217 stands for an arbitrary edge mark, and X\u2212 \u2212Y explicitly indicates the absence of an edge between X and Y in the PAG P; see also Figures 2 and 3.\nInput : independence oracle for V Output : complete PAG P over V\n1: P \u2190 fully \u25e6\u2212\u25e6 connected graph over V 2: for all {X, Y } \u2208 V do 3: search in some clever way for a X\u22a5\u22a5Y |Z 4: P \u2190 R0a (eliminate X\u2212 \u2212Y ) 5: record Sep(X, Y )\u2190 Z 6: end for 7: P \u2190 R0b (unshielded colliders) 8: repeat P \u2190 R1\u2212R4b until finished 9: P \u2190 R5 (uncovered circle paths)\n10: repeat P \u2190 R6\u2212R7 until finished 11: repeat P \u2190 R8a\u2212R10 until finished\nAlgorithm 1: Augmented FCI algorithm"}, {"heading": "3 Inference from causal logic", "text": "Note: we use X, Y , Z, etc. to denote disjoint (sets of) observed variables, and S to denote the (possibly empty) set of selection nodes in a causal DAG GC ."}, {"heading": "3.1 Logical rules from minimal independence", "text": "There is a well-known, fundamental connection between minimal (in)dependencies and causal relations:\nLemma 2.

New statements can be inferred by substituting the subject of one line in another, and then reduce by using the three causal properties from Proposition 1.\nTo illustrate the inference process in deriving (new) causal information, consider these two examples:\nExample 1.

Then for the inference list this gives statement (1:) from the first independence, and (2:) and (3:) from the second:\n1: X \u21d2 Z \u2228 X \u21d2W \u2228 \u2228 X \u21d2 S 2: Z \u21d2 X \u2228 \u2228 Z \u21d2 Y \u2228 Z \u21d2 S 3: W \u21d2 X \u2228 W \u21d2 Y \u2228 W \u21d2 S\nUsing transitivity and irreflexivity, when substituting (2:) and (3:) in (1:), this reduces to (4:)\n` X \u21d2 X \u2228 X \u21d2 X \u2228 X \u21d2 Y \u2228 X \u21d2 S 4: X \u21d2 Y \u2228 X \u21d2 S\nThis case matches instances of R9, where all alternatives for X from the first minimal independence necessarily lead to a causal relation to node Y (or S).

A transitive relation from X to Y is a sequence of nodes [X, Z1, . . . , Zk, V1, . . . , Vm, Y ] (not necessarily distinct), such that:\n- \u2200Zi,\u2203Ui : Zi\u22121\u22a5\u22a5Zi+1 | [Ui \u222a Zi], - \u2200Vj : Vj \u21d2 (Vj+1 \u222a S),\nwith Z0 = X,Zk+1 = V1, Vm+1 = Y , for k,m \u2265 0.\nIn words: a series of overlapping minimal conditional independencies, followed by a causal relation. A transitive relation can be as short as a single independence X \u22a5\u22a5 Y | [Z1], or a relation X \u21d2 Y . As such, it is a generalization of the uncov. p.d. path in section 2.3.\nThe reason for this introduction is the property:\nCorollary 8.

Case (3) covers all instances of rules R5, R9, and R10, and case (4) accounts for tails from orientation rule R4a. In most instances of case (3) the transitive relation requires only a single minimal conditional independence, even for long paths. Often, both transitive relations can be captured together in a single independence, as in Example 2.\nA nice property is that all identifiable selection nodes X \u21d2 S also pop out \u2018automatically\u2019 by applying the inference rules in lemma 1 on instances of case (3):\nCorollary 10. In a PAG P, all identifiable selection nodes X \u21d2 S are covered by case (3), in the form of a minimal independence with two transitive relations back to itself.\nThat leaves just tails from three more orientation rules to handle. However, these too follow implicitly from the existing cases:\nCorollary 11. In a PAG P, all invariant tails from orientation rules R6, R8a, and R8b, are covered by the causal logic rules applied to cases (1)-(4)."}, {"heading": "5 Reconstructing the PAG", "text": "In this section we look at the logical inference process itself, and provide an efficient anytime algorithm for deriving the PAG."}, {"heading": "5.1 Inference procedure", "text": "A nice property is that the logical substitute/reduce steps take on a particularly simple form: it only involves statements that are a logical disjunction of at most two causal relations and possible selection bias, or a single term for the absence of a causal relation. In other words, the list L always keeps the form in section 3.1. Each step consists of a substitution of one statement in another followed by a reduction to this standard form. Furthermore, as more information becomes available, statements in the list can simplify from three to two or even one term.

In the logical causal inference (LoCI) approach, finding a single, arbitrary X\u22a5\u22a5Y | [Z], for each pair of nodes (X, Y ) in the graph (if it exists) is sufficient to find all invariant features of the PAG.\nFortunately, the current implementation of the FCI algorithm already finds only minimal conditional independencies for each pair of nodes (if it exists), as it looks for sets of increasing size until it finds one that separates the two. (This is also the dominant factor in the time-complexity of the algorithm.) For each pair found, we still need to check for other nodes that can destroy this independence (lemma 3, item 2), however, this is negligible compared to the search itself.\nFurthermore, the inferred blocking node from lemma 4, can be tackled efficiently, after all invariant arrowheads have been found from cases (1) and (2): it makes it possible to establish the \u2018non-ancestor\u2019 conditions in the sequence in one go.

Each time a minimal independence has been found, line 6 runs the inference rules to update the identifiable causal information. This step could be run just once, after the independence search has completed, but in practice the impact on performance is negligble and far outweighed by the fact that most causal information is already identifiable (available) in the early stages of the process. At line 8, all non-ancestor relations (X \u21d2 Y ) have been found (see lemma 7), which makes it relatively easy to find the remaining \u2018inferred blocking nodes\u2019 from lemma 4 in line 8.

Finally, lines 10\u2212 13 construct the equivalent PAG representation from the list L.\nThese results can now be summarized as:\nTheorem 1. The Logical Causal Inference (LoCI) algorithm is sound and complete."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion and conclusion", "text": "In this paper we developed a new approach to constraint-based causal discovery: observed minimal (in)dependencies are converted into logical statements about causal relations, and these statements are subsequently combined using basic properties of causality.\nIt leads to a remarkably simple characterization, in which all identifiable causal relations take the form of an (inferred) minimal conditional independence with either elimination of one alternative, or both alternatives leading to the same conclusion.\nThe resulting logical causal inference (LoCI) method was put to work in an efficient anytime algorithm, the first alternative to the augmented FCI-algorithm shown to be both sound and complete. The LoCI algorithm is strikingly simpler than its counterpart in section 2.3. Even though it is not necessarily faster, as for both the overall complexity is dominated by the independence search, the fact that the implementation takes on this very simple and elegant form suggests it is somehow more \u2018natural\u2019 to causal discovery.\nThe way in which the LoCI algorithm builds up this causal information is markedly different from many other constraint-based methods: instead of focussing on combinations of node-pairs that may or may not be separable (the essence of graphical orientation rules), the LoCI algorithm focusses on the nodes that separate them. In particular, as it does not need to search for pairs of nodes that cannot be separated by any set (the edges forming the skeleton of the PAG), the approach taken by the algorithm could be dubbed \u2018structure independent\u2019. As a result, it can be adapted to search for target causal relations in large models, updating each time as new independence information becomes available; of course, if we want to ensure completeness, we still have to find all of them.\nThe simplicity of the LoCI algorithm raises the question if a similar approach is viable in other applications as well. For example, incorporation of causal information from background knowledge or derived from other properties of the distribution (Shimizu et al., 2006; Mooij et al., 2010), is straightforward. The same holds for additional assumptions, such as \u2018no selection bias\u2019. Including interventional information also fits nicely in this framework, and requires only minor modifications of the minimal independence lemma 2. An extension to multiple models, similar to (Triantafillou et al., 2010; Claassen and Heskes, 2010), seems feasible as well. To prove completeness, we had to rely on the known completeness of the augmented FCI algorithm, but we suspect that a more direct proof should be possible.\nPerhaps the most promising aspect of the LoCI approach lies in the flexibility it offers in deriving causal information. For example, we are free to ignore any suspect, \u2018borderline\u2019 (in)dependence decisions, by not including them in the list L in lines 3 and 5: all inferred causal relations remain valid. This should definitely increase the reliability of the output, even though it is no longer guaranteed to be complete. Finally, the \u2018structure independent\u2019 aspect implies there are many different ways to arrive at the same conclusion. This makes it possible to choose the most reliable combination(s) of independencies for a more robust conclusion and to detect inconsistencies. Tracking which logical\nstatements in L are combined to identify new relations could also improve accountability for the output, indicating exactly why a causal relation was found."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "This research was supported by VICI grant 639.023.604 from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)."}, {"heading": "Appendix A. Proofs", "text": "This section contains the key steps of all proofs; for details, see supplement (Claassen and Heskes, 2011).\nLemma 2. Proof sketch. A variant of two well-known results, see (Spirtes et al., 1999; Claassen and Heskes, 2010). (1.) If Z blocks the (final) unblocked path between X and Y given W, then it must be a noncollider on a trek between two of the other nodes involved; hence a directed path in GC , and so a causal relation. (2.) A node can only unblock a path, if there are unblocked paths into that node given the others. Therefore, if Z has a directed path to any (W \u222a S), then conditioning on Z is not needed to unblock the path, and if it has a directed path to X or Y then without Z there is already an unblocked path (via Z). The special case follows from (1.) and acyclicity.\nLemma 4 Proof. In words: if no node Zi has a causal relation (directed path in GC) to either of its neighbors in the sequence [X,Z1, . . . , Zk, Z, Y ], and all neighboring nodes in the sequence are dependent given any subset of Z, then Z has a causal relation to Zk, Y , and/or S. By construction, in GC there is an unblocked path from X to Z, given Z. If both Zk and Y have paths that are into Z, then the sequence would represent an unblocked path between X and Y given Z \u222a Z in GC , which would make X and Y dependent, contrary the given. By the second item (dependent neigbors), all neighbors in the sequence, so also (Zk, Z) and (Z, Y ), are connected by treks between them (or treks to S), that are not blocked by any nodes from Z. Not both these paths from Zk and Y are into Z, therefore Z must either have a directed path to S in GC and/or be an ancestor of Zk or Y .\nLemma 7 Proof sketch. Both cases are sound: (1.) By lemma 3, item 2, the first gives (Y \u21d2 Z) \u2227 (Y \u21d2 S), which, by definition, implies that if Y has an edge to Z in P, then the mark at Y is an (invariant) arrowhead. (2.) The second is an application of lemma 3, item\n1, giving (Z \u21d2 X) \u2228 (Z \u21d2 Y ) \u2228 (Z \u21d2 S), where the first and third are eliminated by the arrowhead at X \u2217\u2192Z (def). Therefore Z \u21d2 Y , and so (acyclicity) also Y \u21d2 Z, but also Y \u21d2 S, otherwise (transitivity) Z \u21d2 S. Therefore, if Y has an edge to Z in P, then it has an arrowhead mark at Y . The proof that they are also complete follows by induction on the graphical orientation rules R0b\u2212R4b, showing that none of them introduces a violation of lemma 7. As these rules are sufficient for arrowhead completeness, it follows that the lemma holds for all invariant arrowheads.\nCorollary 8 Proof. The transitive relation implies:\n1: Z1 \u21d2 X \u2228 Z1 \u21d2 Z2 \u2228 Z1 \u21d2 S k: Zk \u21d2 Zk\u22121\u2228 Zk \u21d2 V1 \u2228 Zk \u21d2 S k+m: Vm \u21d2 Y \u2228 Vm \u21d2 S\nBack substituting in reverse order gives finally, ` Z1 \u21d2 X \u2228 Z1 \u21d2 Y \u2228 Z1 \u21d2 S to substitute in X \u21d2 Z1 \u2228X \u21d2 S.\nLemma 9 Proof sketch. All three cases are sound: (2b) By lemma 3, X \u22a5\u22a5 Y | [W \u222a Z] gives (Z \u21d2 X) \u2228 (Z \u21d2 Y )\u2228 (Z \u21d2 S). Combined with X \u21d2 Z \u2228X \u21d2 S this reduces to (Z \u21d2 Y )\u2228 (Z \u21d2 S), and so a tail at Z if it has an edge to Y in P. (3) Idem, U\u22a5\u22a5V | [W \u222aW ] gives (W \u21d2 U) \u2228 (W \u21d2 V ) \u2228 (W \u21d2 S). From corollary 8, the transitive relations give (W \u21d2 {U \u222a S}) ` (W \u21d2 {Y \u222a S}), and (W \u21d2 {V \u222aS}) ` (W \u21d2 {Y \u222aS}). Substituting these two in the first then gives (W \u21d2 Y )\u2228 (W \u21d2 S). This holds for all nodes on the two transitive chains, hence if Z \u2208 {U, V, W}, then (Z \u21d2 Y )\u2228 (Z \u21d2 S), and therefore a tail Z\u2212\u2212\u2217Y , if they are connected in P. (4) By lemma 4, as Z is an inferred blocking node between X and Y given Z, there is a Zk \u2208 Z such that Z \u21d2 Zk \u2228 Z \u21d2 Y \u2228 Z \u21d2 S. Together with the given Zk \u21d2 Y \u2228 Zk \u21d2 S, this reduces to Z \u21d2 Y \u2228 Z \u21d2 S, and hence an invariant tail Z\u2212\u2192Y . For completeness it is fairly straightforward to see that in a PAG P, all instances of rule R7 match (2b), instances of rules R5, R9, and R10 always match case (3), and R4a matches case (4).\nCorollary 10 Proof sketch. By corollary 8 a transitive relation [W, U, .., W ] implies that W \u21d2 (U \u222a S) ` W \u21d2 S. Idem for [W, V, .., W ]. Two such statements connected by U \u22a5\u22a5 V | [W \u222aW ] then reduce (W \u21d2 U) \u2228 (W \u21d2 V ) \u2228 (W \u21d2 S), from lemma 3, to (W \u21d2 S), i.e. identifiable selection bias. That all nodes with identifiable selection bias have this form follows from the fact that only rules R5 \u2212 R7 can produce undirected edges on\nnodes (corresponding to identifiable selection). The uncovered circle path from R5 already has this form; R6 can be ignored when identifying new nodes, andR7 can only produce undirected edges on transitive chains connecting two distinct circle-path components.\nCorollary 11 Proof. R8a and R8b do not take (in)dependence information as input, but only need lemma 1 to combine two relations already found as a result of cases (1)-(4). The tail from rule R6 only signifies that Z \u21d2 S, which will be found as case (3), by corollary 10.\nLemma 12 Proof sketch. We know from lemmas 7 and 9 that all orientation rules are covered by some combination of minimal independencies and subsequent dependencies. From the graphical description, we see that the rules orient tails/arrowheads between adjacent nodes that either involve a noncollider between two nonadjacent nodes, (and are therefore part of all minimal conditional independencies between the two), or as one of the separated nodes in the conditional independence (so any will do), possibly with a direct link to a node that destroys this independence (which will therefore also be found). The only rule that is not entirely straightforward is R2a, but this boils down to a similar case as for the invariant arrowheads in lemma 7, to which the same argument can be applied, to show that the node Z is a necessary part of at least some minimal independence that is destroyed by Y . Therefore all rules are covered, if we have at least one minimal independence for each pair of nonadjacent nodes, in combination with the subsequent dependencie. As we know that the set of graphical orientation rules is sufficient to find all invariant features in the PAG (Zhang, 2008a), this proves the lemma.\nTheorem 1 Proof sketch. Soundness follows from the validity of the lemmas 3 and 4, that produce the logical statements in the list L, in combination with the causal logic rules in lemma 1. Completeness follows from the fact that all rules are instancess of cases (1)-(4) for a single, arbitrary minimal independence between nodes, in combination with subsequent dependencies (lemma 11), the fact that all logical inference in each of the cases (1)-(4) is covered by lemma 3, the fact that case (1) and (2) will find all required non-ancestor relations (= invariant arrowheads, see Zhang, 2008a, lemma 6), needed to obtain the only remaining piece of information (inferred blocking node for case (4) from lemma 4). After running the logical rules on this set of statements to completion, all invariant edge marks have been found and can be transferred to the PAG."}], "references": [{"title": "Towards characterizing markov equivalence classes for directed acyclic graphs with latent variables", "author": ["R.A.

The approach shows that every identifiable causal relation corresponds to one of just two fundamental forms.
