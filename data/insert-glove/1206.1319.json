Representing uncertain and imprecise information", "text": "Fuzziness and randomness are two distinct components of uncertainty. While fuzzy sets are a rigorous softening of random sets, many of the operations defined in fuzzy logic lack a complete formalism, and are not strongly supported by experimental evidence. On the other hand causal possibilistic networks (CPN) or possibilistic Bayesian networks provide an ultimately flexible inference mechanism based on certainty or possibility distribution principles. However, CPNs suffer from the overwhelmingly large conditional possibility tables with discrete variables likewise probabilistic networks namely Bayesian networks. Fuzzification of continuous or crisp variables reduces the size of conditional certainty tables (case of certain networks in witch we use certainty degrees instead of possibilities or probabilities) to practically acceptable levels and these tables exhaustively encompass all the intuitive and fuzzy rules for inference problems. In this way, we reach a new knowledge representing engine, called fuzzy certain Bayesian networks, which provides a rigorous formalism for inference under fuzziness and randomness. The main idea of our modeling system of uncertain and imprecise knowledge is inspired from [3] where the authors have extended Dubois and Prade's [2] definition about the possibility and necessity measures of classical propositions to the case of\nInternet and Information Technology in Modern Organizations: Challenges & Answers 827\nfuzzy propositions through fuzzy truth values [1]. A classical proposition is true in some possible worlds and false in the rest of possible worlds, while a fuzzy proposition \u00de is true with respect to a possible world to a degree [3]. We model our uncertainty about the actual world by defining a fuzzy necessity distribution over all possible worlds to specify the degree of necessity that the actual world is in each certain world. More formally, we consider that each necessity degree associated to a propositional formula \u00de is a fuzzy number mapping from an interval [\u03b21,\u03b22]\u2286 [0 , 1] to [0 , 1] where [\u03b21, \u03b22] is given by expert. Here the exact necessity degree is not specified but we are \"certain\" that it belongs to the interval [\u03b21, \u03b22]. For each state (respectively for each formula), we associate a fuzzy necessity degree \u03c7 \u2208 [\u03b21, \u03b22]. And then we map the fuzzy necessity distribution defined by a membership function \u00b5 (\u03c71). More formally: \u00b5 : [\u03b21, \u03b22] [0 1] (1) \u03c71 \u00b5 (\u03c71)\nFigure1 illustrates the structure of fuzzy certain Bayesian network with five nodes where nodes may receive fuzzy values. \u2135(*) is the associated fuzzy certainty (i.e. necessity) distribution.

For example, the statement \u2018Jhon is tall\u2019 can be more or less true. If we had a precise definition, such as \u2018Jhon is tall if it has at least 1.75 of size\u2019, the membership function would only have values 0 and 1, and fuzzy sets would not be needed.

Such a network is usually represented as a directed graph in which there is an edge from each of the parents to the conditioned variable (fig 2). In our work a certain Bayesian networks is considered as a graphical representation of uncertain information. It offers an alternative to probabilistic causal network when numerical data are not available.\nLet V= {A1,A2,..An} a set of variables (i.e attributes or proprieties). The set of interpretations is the Cartesian product of all domains of attributes in V. When each attribute is binary, domains are denoted by Di={ai,\u00acai}. A certain graph denoted by NG is an acyclic graph where nodes represents attributes i.e a patient temperature and edges represent causal links between them. Uncertainty is represented by necessities distribution, and conditional necessities for each attribute explaining the link force between them.

As the formal representation of the knowledge base, we use a set of certain formulae. We represent random variables with necessities weights. Formally a necessity valued knowledge base is defined as the set: \u2211= {(\u03d5\u03b9 , \u03b1i) , i = 1\u2026.m} (14) Where \u03d5\u03b9 denotes a classical propositional formula, and \u03b1i denotes the lower bound of certainty (i.e necessity). We can represent the information contained in each node of a Bayesian network, as well as the quantitative information contained in the link matrices, if we can represent all the direct parent/child relations. We express the relation between each random variable and its parents over a class of networks with a collection of quantified formulae. The collection of formulae represents the relation between the random variable and its parents for any ground instantiation of the quantified variables. The network fragment consisting of a random variable and its parents with a set of formulae of the form (\u03d5 , \u03b1). We give next some definitions inspired from [9] and [10].

This is means that each redundant formula should be removed from the certain valued knowledge base since it can be deduced from the rest of formulae. Next, we describe the process that permit to deduce a certain valued knowledge base from a certain network.\nLet NG be a certain Bayesian network consisting of a set of labeled variables V= {A1,A2,..An}.

Based o the results obtained in [9], we can check in our case that it is possible to recover conditional necessities from \u2211A according to equations (17).\n1 if \u2200 (\u03d5i , \u03b1i) \u2208\u2211 \u03c9 \u03d5i N\u2211(\u03c9) = (17) 1- max { \u03b1i : \u03c9 \u03d5i } otherwise Example: by applying equation (16), we get the certain knowledge base associated to the certain\nBayesian network described in section 4.1. \u2211A = {(a, 0.9 )} \u2211B = {(b\u2228a,0.7),(b\u2228\u00aca,0.75)(\u00acb\u2228a, 0.8)} \u2211C={(c\u2228a, 0.9),(c\u2228\u00aca, 0.9) (\u00acc\u2228a, 0.8)} \u2211D = {{(d\u2228b\u2228c, 0.8), (d\u2228b\u2228\u00acc, 0.8), (d\u2228\u00acb\u2228c,0.9), (d\u2228\u00acb\u2228\u00acc, 0.6 ), (\u00acd\u2228\u00acb\u2228c, 0.9 )} Next section shows the other form of certain valued knowledge where weighted formulae will be replaced by fuzzy membership function de define a new representation of uncertain information by the mean of what we call fuzzy knowledge bases."}, {"heading": "5. CBN based on fuzzy necessity distribution", "text": "Logical formulae with a weight strictly greater than a given levels (lower bounds of necessity degrees) are immune to inconsistency and can be safely used in deductive reasoning [11]. However in order to perform reasoning for both imprecise and uncertain information, two important issues should be addressed. First, any improvement of the possibility level for a piece of information can only be achieved at the expense of the specificity of the information; second the accorded levels to the causality explained in terms of rules (case of fuzzy logic) and conditional dependencies (case of Bayesian networks) are somewhat expensive due to the fact that these confidence level is somewhat critical. We propose so to combine these three approaches (Bayesian networks certainty distribution and fuzzy logic) to develop a method for uncertain and imprecise knowledge representation that may improve decision based systems. Our fuzzy beliefs are to emulate a certain Bayesian necessity measure. For simplicity each variable here has two states: the presence or absence of an entity. The belief that A is present takes the form of a fuzzy truth fA. The extent to witch the belief of variable state influences the state beliefs of parent\nor child is modelled by a fuzzy set membership function: one for each influence direction. Example: Let our certain network be as described in figure representing a Bayesian network in metastatic cancer.\nFig. 4 shows a Bayesian network representing the above cause and effect relationships. Table 2 lists the causal influences in terms of fuzzy certainty distributions. Each variable is characterized by an unknown necessity degree given the state of its parents. For instance: C \u2208 [0, 1] represents the dichotomy between having a brain tumor and not having one, c denotes the assertion C = 1 or \u201cBrain tumor is present\u201d, and \u00acc is the negation of c, namely, C =0. The root node, A, which has no parent, is characterized by its prior fuzzy certainty distribution. Example Le the conditional fuzzy necessities associated to the graph presented in figure 4 be as described in table 3. For reason of simplicity we kept here four nodes only as in the graph presented in figure 3.\nFor instance N(d| b,\u00acc) cannot be 0.1 as described in table 1 but rather is a fuzzy number say \u03c71 \u2208[\u03b2D|BC1 , \u03b2 D|BC2 ] where \u03c71 = \u2135(d| b,\u00acc) is the fuzzy necessity associated with the fuzzy formula (d| b,\u00acc) and is associated with a membership function \u00b5 ( \u03c71 ) supposed to be a triangular function (respectively \u00b5 can be trapezoid or other kind of functions). \u00b5 is represented as follow (figure 5):\nInternet and Information Technology in Modern Organizations: Challenges & Answers 831\nThen we can deduce the next possible representation of \u00b5(\u03c71) as: \u00b5(\u03c71) = k1 x (\u03c71 \u2013\u03b2D|BC1) \u2013 k2 x (|\u03c71 \u2013 \u03b2D|BC2| + \u03c71 \u2013 \u03b1) Where:\n- \u03b1, k1 and k2 are two defined constants.. - | * | is the absolute value of term *\nThe above expression and figure mean that the interval of \u03c71 is [\u03b2D|BC1 , \u03b2 D|BC2 ]. If \u03c71 = \u03b1 then \u00b5(\u03c71)=1, implying that the fuzzy necessity \u03c71 = \u03b1 is the most possible situation. If \u03c71 \u2265 \u03b2 D|BC2 or \u03c71\u2264 \u03b2D|BC1 then \u00b5(\u03c71) = 0, the possible manifestation of \u03c71."}, {"heading": "6. Transformation between FBN and FNB", "text": "Analogously, when the given necessities degree are fuzzy numbers as we described in section 5, the necessity distribution N(X) associated to a node X is considered as a fuzzy distribution defined by a membership function \u00b5 : [\u03b21, \u03b22] [0 1] (18) \u03c7 \u00b5 (\u03c7) Example: consider the graph of figure 3. For simplicity each variable here has two states: the presence or absence of an entity and we will define the same membership function to a as to \u00aca.\nLet the different membership be as follow: \u00b5i(\u03c7) = ki1 x (\u03c7 \u2013\u03b2ij1) \u2013 ki2 x (|\u03c7 \u2013 \u03b2ij2| + \u03c7 \u2013 \u03b1i) Where:\n- \u00b5i(\u03c7) is the membership function associated to the fuzzy variable \u03c7, supposed to be triangular. - ki1 and ki2 are the used constant in each membership function supposed to be triangular. - \u03b2ij1 and \u03b2ij2 are the two min and the max boundary of a necessity degree.\nFinally by maximization of each membership function, we can deduce an optimal value for the certainty degree associated to each fuzzy variable (i.e. proposition).

Finally a fuzzy knowledge base can be defined so as the set of fuzzy certain formulae. We represent random variables with fuzzy necessities weights.

Conclusion and discussion", "text": "The present paper pretended to be an attempt to show and understand partially the world complexity that is being increasingly observed, being a try to contribute to ordering and organizing it. The considered approach combined the fuzzy logic and possibilistic logic in a framework of causal networks, which makes it an efficient tool that models knowledge taking into account the expert's subjectivity, vagueness and imprecision. Certain Bayesian networks with fuzzy knowledge bases approach in a natural way gives us the subsethood of the evidence for each logical formula. Although the methodology proposed in this paper, is aimed and illustrated by some typical examples, the developed techniques require experimental results. A future work is to extend this representation by definition of efficient algorithms for locally inferences. A future work will consist also on validating this approach by applying methodologies developed here on a real problem of knowledge representation with large scale data."}, {"heading": "8.

This paper deals with different definitions and classifications of uncertainty, sources of uncertainty, and theories and methodologies presented to deal with uncertainty. Fuzzification of crisp certainty degrees to fuzzy variables improves the quality of the network and tends to bring smoothness and robustness in the network performance. The aim is to provide a new approach for decision under uncertainty that combines three methodologies: Bayesian networks certainty distribution and fuzzy logic. Within the framework proposed in this paper, we address the issue of extending the certain networks to a fuzzy certain networks in order to cope with a vagueness and limitations of existing models for decision under imprecise and uncertain knowledge", "creator": "PDFCREATOR Version 0.8.0"}}}
