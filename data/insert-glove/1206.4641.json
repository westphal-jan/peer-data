Introduction", "text": "Supervised learning (Bishop, 2006; Hastie T., 2009) infers a function that maps inputs to desired outputs under the guidance of training data. Two main tasks in supervised learning are classification and regression. A huge number of supervised learning methods have been developed in several decades (see a com-\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nprehensive empirical comparison of these methods in (Caruana & Niculescu-Mizil, 2006)). Existing methods can be roughly divided into statistics based and function learning based (Kotsiantis et al., 2006). One advantage of function learning methods is that powerful mathematical theories in functional analysis can be utilized rather than doing optimizations on discrete data points.\nMost function learning methods can be derived from Tikhonov regularization, which minimizes a loss term plus a smoothing regularizer. The most successful classification and regression method is SVM (Bishop, 2006; Hastie T., 2009; Shawe-Taylor & Cristianini, 2000), whose cost function is composed of a hinge loss and a RKHS norm determined by a kernel. Replacing the hinge loss by a squared loss, the modified algorithm is called Regularized Least Squares (RLS) method (Rifkin, 2002). In addition, manifold regularization (Belkin et al., 2006) introduced a regularizer of squared gradient magnitude on manifolds. Its discrete version amounts to graph Laplacian regularization (Nadler et al., 2009; Zhou & Scho\u0308lkopf, 2005), which approximates the original energy functional. A most recent work is the geometric level set (GLS) classifier (Varshney & Willsky, 2010), with an energy functional composed of a margin-based loss and a geometric regularization term based on the surface area\nof the decision boundary. Experiments showed that GLS is competitive with SVM and other state-of-theart classifiers.\nIn this paper, the supervised learning problem is formulated as an energy functional minimization under Tikhonov regularization scheme, with the energy composed of a squared loss and a total variation (TV) penalty or an Euler\u2019s elastica (EE) penalty. Since the TV and EE models have achieved great success in image denoising and image inpainting (Aubert & Kornprobst, 2006; Barbero & Sra, 2011; Chan & Shen, 2005), a natural question is whether the success of TV and EE models on image processing applications can be transferred to high dimensional data analysis such as supervised learning. This paper investigates the question by extending TV and EE models to supervised learning settings, and evaluating their performance on benchmark data sets against state-ofthe-art methods. Figure 1 shows the classification result on the popular two moon data by the EE classifier, and the learned target function. Interestingly, the GLS classifier (Varshney & Willsky, 2010) is also motivated by image processing techniques, and its gradient descent time marching leads to a mean curvature flow.\nThe paper is organized as follows. We begin with a brief review of TV and EE in Section 2. In Section 3 the proposed models are described, and numerical solutions are developed in Section 4. Section 5 presents the experimental results, and Section 6 concludes this paper."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "We briefly introduce total variation and Euler\u2019s elastica from an image processing perspective, and point out connections with prior work in the machine learning literature."}, {"heading": "2.1. Total Variation (TV)", "text": "The total variation of a 1D real-valued function f is defined as\nV ab (f) = sup np\u22121\u2211 i=0 |f(xi+1)\u2212 f(xi)|,\nwhere the supremum runs over all partitions of given interval [a, b]. If f is differentiable, the total variation can be written as\nV ab (f) = \u222b b a |f \u2032(x)|dx.\nSimply, it is a measure of the total quantity of the change of a function. Notice that if f \u2032(x) > 0, x \u2208 [a, b], it is exactly f(b)\u2212 f(a) by the basic theorem of calculus. Total variation has been widely used for image processing tasks such as denoising and inpainting. The pioneering work is Rudin, Osher, and Fatemi\u2019s image denoising model (Rudin et al., 1992):\nJ = \u222b \u2126 ((I \u2212 I0)2 + \u03bb|\u2207I|)dx,\nwhere I0 is the input image with noise, I the desired output image, \u03bb a regulation parameter that balances two terms, and \u2126 a 2D image domain. The first fitting term measures the fidelity to the input, while the second is a p-Sobolev regularization term (p = 1) where \u2207I is understood in the distributional sense. The main merit is to preserve significant image edges during denoising (Aubert & Kornprobst, 2006; Chan & Shen, 2005). Note that TV may have different definitions (Barbero & Sra, 2011).\nIn the machine learning literature, p-Sobolev regularizer can be found in nonparametric smoothing splines, generalized additive models, and projection pursuit regression models (Hastie T., 2009). Specifically, Belkin et al. proposed the manifold regularization term\u222b\nx\u2208M |\u2207Mf |2dx,\non a manifold M (Belkin et al., 2006). On the other hand, discrete graph Laplacian regularization was discussed in (Zhou & Scho\u0308lkopf, 2005) as\u2211\nv\u2208V |\u2207vf |p,\nwhere v is a vertex from V , and p is an arbitrary number. This penalty measures the roughness of f over a graph."}, {"heading": "2.2. Euler\u2019s Elastica (EE)", "text": "Euler (1744) first introduced the elastica energy for a curve on modeling torsion-free elastic rods. Then Mumford (Mumford, 1991) reintroduced elastica into computer vision. Later, elastica based image inpainting methods were developed in (Chan et al., 2002; Masnou & Morel, 1998).\nA curve \u03b3 is said to be Euler\u2019s elastica if it is the equilibrium curve of the elasticity energy:\nE[\u03b3] = \u222b \u03b3 (a+ b\u03ba2)ds, (1)\nwhere a and b stand for two positive constant weights, \u03ba denotes the scalar curvature, and ds is the arc length\nelement. Euler obtained the energy in studying the steady shape of a thin and torsion-free rod under external forces. The curve implies the lowest elastica energy, thus getting its name. According to (Mumford, 1991), the key link between the elastica and image inpainting relies on the the interpolation capability of elastica. That is, elastica can comply to the connectivity principle better than total variation. Such kinds of \u201dnonlinear splines\u201d, like classical polynomial splines, are natural tools for completing the missing or occluded edges.\nThe Euler\u2019s elastica based inpainting model was proposed as (Chan & Shen, 2005)\nJ = \u222b \u2126\\D (I \u2212 I0)2dx+ \u03bb \u222b \u2126 (a+ b\u03ba2)|\u2207I|dx, (2)\nwhere D is the region to be inpainted, \u2126 the whole image domain, and \u03ba the curvature of the associated level set curve with\n\u03ba = \u2207 \u00b7 ( \u2207I |\u2207I| ). (3)\nBy using calculus of variation, its minimization is reduced to an nonlinear Euler-Lagrange equation. The finite difference scheme can be used to give numerical implementation, and experimental results show that the EE based inpainting performs better than its TV version.\nElastica can be regarded as an extension of total variation, since elastica degenerates to total variation if set a = 1 and b = 0. In fact, elastica is a combination of total variation suppressing oscillations in the gradient direction, and a curvature regularization term that penalizes non-smooth level set curves (see Figure 1)."}, {"heading": "3. The Proposed Framework", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1. Problem Setup", "text": "The general supervised learning problem can be described as follows: given a training data {(x1, y1), ...(xn, yn)} with data points xi \u2208 \u2126 \u2282 Rd and corresponding target varibles yi, the goal is to estimate an unknown function u(x) for a new point x. The difference between classification and regression lies only in the corresponding target values, with one discrete and the other continuous. The widely used Tikhonov regularization framework for supervised learning can be formulated as:\nmin n\u2211\ni=1\nL(u(xi), yi) + \u03bbS(u), (4)\nwhere L denotes a loss function and S(u) is a smoothing term. A variety of loss functions L have been pro-\nposed in the literature: hinge loss for SVM, squared loss for RLS, logistic loss for logistic regression, Huber loss, exponential loss, and among others. Throughout the paper, squared loss is used in all models due to its rather simpler differential form."}, {"heading": "3.2. Laplacian Regularization (LR)", "text": "A commonly used model using squared loss can be written as\nmin n\u2211\ni=1\n(u(xi)\u2212 yi)2 + \u03bbS(u). (5)\nIf the RKHS norm is used for the smoothing term, the model is called regularized least squares (RLS) (Rifkin, 2002). Another natural choice is the squared L2-norm of the gradient: S(u) = |\u2207u|2, as proposed in (Belkin et al., 2006). Under a continuous setting, we get the following Laplacian regularization (LR) model:\nJLR[u] = \u222b \u2126 ((u\u2212 y)2 + \u03bb|\u2207u|2)dx. (6)\nThis LR model has been widely used in the image processing literatures. Using calculus of variations, the minimization can be reduced to the following EulerLagrange partial differential equation (PDE) with a natural boundary condition along \u2202\u2126:{\n\u2212\u03bb\u25b3u+ (u\u2212 y) = 0 \u2202u \u2202n |\u2202\u2126 = 0 , (7)\nwhere \u25b3u is the Laplacian of u, and n denotes the normal vector along the boundary \u2202\u2126. This PDE is relatively simple and can be solved using common methods in two and three dimensions. The next Section provides a function approximation method for solving the PDE in high dimensions."}, {"heading": "3.3. Total Variation (TV) based Smoothing", "text": "Our goal is to explore how TV and EE can be applied to classification and regression problems on high dimensional data sets. A typical procedure has three steps: (a) Set the function learning problem under a continuous setting and design a proper energy functional; (b) Derive the Euler-Lagrange PDE via the calculus of variations; (c) Solve the PDE on discrete data points.\nSimilar to image denoising, total variation (TV) based supervised learning can be formulated as\nJTV [u] = \u222b \u2126 (u\u2212 y)2dx+ \u03bb \u222b \u2126 |\u2207u|dx. (8)\nNote that for binary classification the zero level set of u serves as the final decision boundary. The only\ndifference between LR and TV is just the p-Sobolev regularizer with p = 2 for LR and p = 1 for TV. Intuitively, LR penalizes too much gradients on edges, while TV can permit sharper edges near the decision boundaries between two classes."}, {"heading": "3.4. Euler\u2019s Elastica (EE) based Smoothing", "text": "Elastica based supervised learning can be formulated as\nJEE [u] = \u222b \u2126 (u\u2212 y)2dx+ \u03bb \u222b \u2126 (a+ b\u03ba2)|\u2207u|dx, (9)\nwhere\n\u03ba = \u2207 \u00b7 \u2207u |\u2207u| . (10)\nDue to the elastica regularizer, the resulting decision boundary of this model can have the lowest elastica energy. If set a = 1 and b = 0, this model degenerates to be the TV model. Therefore, an unified solution can be implemented for both TV model and EE model, as described in the next Section.\nHere we have remarks on the curvature in high dimensional spaces. For a 1-D curve such as in image inpainting tasks, u(x, y) = 0 determines a level set curve according to the implicit function theorem. For a 2-D surface, the curvature given by (3) amounts to the mean curvature of this surface. From (Spivak & Spivak, 1979), the mean curvature can be defined as the average of principal curvatures. Abstractly, it can be expressed as the trace of the second fundamental form divided by the intrinsic dimension d. Table 1 summarizes curvature expressions in 1- D, 2-D, and high dimensional spaces. Hence the same expression(10) can be used for high dimensional situations since the constant 1d\u22121 can be transferred to b or \u03bb."}, {"heading": "4. Algorithms", "text": "In contrast to discrete methods such as SVM and graph Laplacian, the proposed framework operates in a\ncontinuous fashion where powerful mathematical analysis tools can make a sense. Specifically, the calculus of variations can be exploited to minimize the energy functional, leading to the Euler-Langrange PDE.\nAs we have mentioned in section 3, the LR functional minimization can be transformed to solving the PDE (7). Similarly, we get the following PDE for the TV model\n\u03bb\u2207 \u00b7 ( \u2207u |\u2207u| ) \u2212 (u\u2212 y) = 0, (11)\nand the PDE for the EE model\n\u03bb\u2207 \u00b7V \u2212 (u\u2212 y) = 0, (12)\nwhere\nV = \u03d5(\u03ba)n\u2212 1 |\u2207u| \u2207(\u03d5\u2032(\u03ba)|\u2207u|)\n+ 1\n|\u2207u|3 \u2207u(\u2207uT\u2207(\u03d5\u2032(\u03ba)|\u2207u|)), (13)\nand \u03d5(\u03ba) := 1+b\u03ba2 by fixing a = 1 for simplicity. One can refer to (Chan et al., 2002) for details about the calculus of variations.\nDue to the nonlinearity of the regularizer in TV and EE model, the corresponding PDE is too complicated to be efficiently solved. Even though the PDE in (7) associated with the LR model can be solved by Finite Difference Method (FDM) or Finite Element Method (FEM) in 2-D or 3-D spaces, currently we have no PDE tools to deal with high dimensional data. Therefore we take a function approximation idea by using radial basis functions (RBF), similar to the treatment in GLS (Varshney & Willsky, 2010)."}, {"heading": "4.1. Radial Basis Function Approximation", "text": "The function approximation idea relies on the fact that a function u(x) can be expressed as a sum of weighted basis function {\u03c6i(x)}.

In order to handle multi-class situations, usually one versus all or one versus one strategies can be adopted. If using one vs all, one needs to learn M functions to fulfill the multi-class task, where M is the number of classes. Recently in (Varshney & Willsky, 2010), an efficient binary encoding strategy was proposed to represent the decision boundary by only log2M functions. In our experiments the one vs all strategy is used. Same as the binary problems, we use the 5-fold cross-validation to choose the optimal parameters for each method. Except BPNN, all other methods have 2 common parameters which are searched from logarithm from\u221210 : 10 with step 1. The results of average\naccuracies are shown in table 3.\nThe accuracy results demonstrate that BPNN performs the worst, while TV and EE are comparable to SVM on the 11 test data sets. Compared with TV/EE, SVM achieves higher accuracies on 4 data sets, performs worse on 4 data sets, and offers the same best accuracies on 2 data sets. One reason might be that very complex and even wiggly decision boundaries are preferred for some multi-class data sets. Due to the strong regularization on the geometric shapes, TV/EE can not adapt to yield complex decision hypersurfaces for these data sets."}, {"heading": "5.3. Regression", "text": "We use seven regression data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository to validate the proposed methods compared with SVM, BPNN, and LR. All data sets are scaled to [0,1]. Note that here the Gradient Descent (GD) method is used for TV and EE. We take the same experimental settings by running ten times of 5- fold cross-validation for each data set. Table 4 shows the regression results using mean square errors (MSE). Clearly, we can see that both TV and EE achieve lower\nMSE than SVM and LR on 6 data sets. Also TV and EE outperform BPNN on 5 data sets. The results demonstrated superb regression ability of our proposed methods."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "Regularization framework and function learning approaches have become very popular in the recent machine learning literature. Due to the great success of total variation and Euler\u2019s elastica models in image processing area, we extend these two models for supervised classification and regression on high dimensional data sets. The TV regularizer permits steeper edges near the decision boundaries, while the elastica smoothing term penalizes non-smooth level set hypersurfaces of the target function. Compared with SVM and BPNN, our proposed methods have demonstrated the competitive performance on commonly used benchmark data sets. Specifically, TV and EE models achieve better performance on most data sets for binary classification and regression. Currently one main disadvantage is the slow convergence speed of iteration procedures. The future work is to explore other\nfitting loss term such as hinge loss, to study other possibilities of basis functions, to investigate the existence and uniqueness of the PDE solutions, and to reduce the running time."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful suggestions.

This paper investigates how to extend TV and EE to the supervised learning settings on high dimensional data. The supervised learning problem can be formulated as an energy functional minimization under Tikhonov regularization scheme, where the energy is composed of a squared loss and a total variation smoothing (or Euler\u2019s elastica smoothing). Its solution via variational principles leads to an Euler-Lagrange PDE. However, the PDE is always high-dimensional and cannot be directly solved by common methods. Instead, radial basis functions are utilized to approximate the target function, reducing the problem to finding the linear coefficients of basis functions. We apply the proposed methods to supervised learning tasks (including binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression) on benchmark data sets. Extensive experiments have demonstrated promising results of the proposed methods.", "creator": " TeX output 2012.05.16:1551"}}}
