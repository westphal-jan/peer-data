This reliance has at its core the Revelation Principle [Myerson, 1981], which states that the outcome of any given mechanism can still be achieved if we restrict the design space to mechanisms that induce truthful revelation of agent preferences.

Our approach yields optimal or nearly optimal mechanisms in several application domains using various objective functions.
