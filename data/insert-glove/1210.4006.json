For example, in machine learning, a standard assumption is that the training and test data are generated from the same distribution. However, in some scenarios, such as Domain Adaptation (DA), this is not the case and the distributions are only assumed similar. It is quite intuitive to denote when two inputs are similar in nature, yet the following question remains open: given two sets of examples, how do we test whether or not they were generated by similar distributions? The main focus of this work is providing a similarity score and a corresponding statistical procedure that gives one possible answer to this question.\nDiscrepancy between distributions has been studied for decades, and a wide variety of distance scores have been proposed. However, not all proposed scores can be used for testing similarity. The main difficulty is that most scores have not been designed for statistical testing of similarity but equality, known as the Two-Sample Problem (TSP). Formally, let P and Q be the generating distributions of the data; the TSP tests the null hypothesisH0 : P = Q against the general alternative H1 : P 6= Q. This is one of the classical problems in statistics. However, sometimes, like in DA, the interesting question is with regards to similarity rather than equality. By design, most equality tests may not be transformed to test similarity; see Section 3 for a review of representative works.\nIn this work, we quantify similarity using a new score, the Perturbed Variation (PV). We propose that similarity is related to some predefined value of permitted variations. Consider the gait of two male subjects as an example. If their physical characteristics are similar, we expect their walk to be similar, and thus assume the examples representing the two are from similar distributions. This intuition applies when the distribution of our measurements only endures small changes for people with similar characteristics. Put more generally, similarity depends on what \u201csmall changes\u201d are in a given application, and implies that similarity is domain specific. The PV, as hinted by its name, measures the discrepancy between two distributions while allowing for some perturbation of each distribution; that is, it allows small differences between the distributions. What accounts for small differences is a parameter of the PV, and may be defined by the user with regard to a specific domain.\nar X\niv :1\n21 0.\n40 06\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n1 5\nO ct\n2 01\nFigure 1 illustrates the PV.

Let P and Q be two distributions on a Banach space X , and let M(P,Q) be the set of all joint distributions on X \u00d7 X with mariginals P and Q. The PV, with respect to a distance function d : X \u00d7 X \u2192 R and , is defined by\nPV(P,Q, ,d) .= inf \u00b5\u2208M(P,Q) P\u00b5[d(X,Y ) > ], (1)\nover all pairs (X,Y ) \u223c \u00b5, such that the marginal of X is P and the marginal of Y is Q.\nPut into words, Equation (1) defines the joint distribution \u00b5 that couples the two distributions such that the probability of the event of a pair (X,Y ) \u223c \u00b5 being within a distance grater than is minimized.\nThe solution to (1) is a special case of the classical mass transport problem of Monge [1] and its version by Kantorovich: inf\u00b5\u2208M(P,Q) \u222b X\u00d7X c(x, y)d\u00b5(x, y),where c : X \u00d7X \u2192 R is a measurable cost function. When c is a metric, the problem describes the 1st Wasserstein metric. Problem (1) may be rephrased as the optimal mass transport problem with the cost function c(x, y) = 1[d(x,y)> ], and may be rewritten as inf\u00b5 \u222b\u222b 1[d(x,y)> ]\u00b5(y|x)dy P (x)dx. The probability \u00b5(y|x) defines the transportation plan of x to y. The PV optimal transportation plan is obtained by perturbing the mass of each point x in its neighborhood so that it redistributes to the distribution of Q. These small perturbations do not add any cost, while transportation of mass to further areas is equally costly. Note that when P = Q the PV is zero as the optimal plan is simply the identity mapping. Due to its cost function, the PV it is not a metric, as it is symmetric but does not comply with the triangle inequality and may be zero for distributions P 6= Q. Despite this limitation, this cost function fully quantifies the intuition that small variations should not be penalized when similarity is considered. In this sense, similarity is not unique by definition, as more than one distribution can be similar to a reference distribution.\nThe PV is also closely related to the Total Variation distance (TV) that may be written, using a coupling characterization, as TV (P,Q) = inf\u00b5\u2208M(P,Q) P\u00b5 [X 6= Y ] [2]. This formulation argues that any transportation plan, even to a close neighbor, is costly. Due to this property, the TV is known to be an overly sensitive measure that overestimates the distance between distributions. For example, consider two distributions defined by the dirac delta functions \u03b4(a) and \u03b4(a+ ). For any , the TV between the two distributions is 1, while they are intuitively similar. The PV resolves this problem by adding perturbations, and therefore is a natural extension of the TV. Notice, however, that the used to compute the PV need not be infinitesimal, and is defined by the user.\nThe PV can be seen as a conciliatory between the Wasserstein distance and the TV. As explained, it relaxes the sensitivity of the TV; however, it does not \u201cover optimize\u201d the transportation plan. Specifically, distances larger than the allowed perturbation are discarded. This aspect also contributes to the efficiency of estimation of the PV from samples; see Section 2.2."}, {"heading": "2.1 The Perturbed Variation on Discrete Distributions", "text": "It can be shown that for two discrete distributions Problem (1) is equivalent to the following problem.

The objective is to minimize these discrepancies, therefore matrix Z describes the optimal transportation plan constrained to -perturbations. An example of an optimal plan is presented in Figure 2.1."}, {"heading": "2.2 Estimation of the Perturbed Variation", "text": "Typically, we are given samples from which we would like to estimate the PV. Given two samples S1 = {x1, ..., xn} and S2 = {y1, ..., ym}, generated by distributions P and Q respectively, P\u0302V(S1, S2, , d) is:\nmin wi\u22650,vi\u22650,Zij\u22650\n1\n2n n\u2211 i=1 wi + 1 2m m\u2211 j=1 vj (3)\ns.t. \u2211\nyj\u2208ng(xi, )\nZij + wi = 1, \u2211\nxi\u2208ng(yj , )\nZij + vj = 1, \u2200i, j\nZij = 0 , \u2200(i, j) 6\u2208 ng(xi, ),\nwhere Z \u2208 Rn\u00d7m. When n = m, the optimization in (3) is identical to (2), as in this case the samples define a discrete distribution. However, when n 6= m Problem (3) also accounts for the difference in the size of the two samples.\nProblem (3) is a linear program with constraints that may be written as a totally unimodular matrix. It follows that one of the optimal solutions of (3) is integral [3]; that is, the mass of each sample is transferred as a whole. This solution may be found by solving the optimal assignment on an appropriate bipartite graph [3]. Let G = (V = (A,B), E) define this graph, with A = {xi, wi ; i = 1, ..., n} and B = {yj , vj ; j = 1, ...,m} as its bipartite partition. The vertices xi \u2208 A are linked\nAlgorithm 1 Compute P\u0302V(S1, S2, ,d)\nInput: S1 = {x1, ..., xn} and S2 = {y1, ..., ym}, rate, and distance measure d. 1. Define G\u0302 = (V\u0302 = (A\u0302, B\u0302), E\u0302): A\u0302 = {xi \u2208 S1}, B\u0302 = {yj \u2208 S2},\nConnect an edge eij \u2208 E\u0302 if d(xi, yj) \u2264 . 2. Compute the maximum matching on G\u0302. 3. Define Sw and Sv as number of unmatched edges in sets S1 and S2 respectively. Output: P\u0302 V (S1, S2, , d) = 12 ( Sw n + Sv m ).\nwith edge weight zero to yj \u2208 ng(xi) and with weight\u221e to yj 6\u2208 ng(xi). In addition, every vertex xi (yj) is linked with weight 1 to wi (vj). To make the graph complete, assign zero cost edges between all vertices xi and wk for k 6= i (and vertices yj and vk for k 6= j). We note that the Earth Mover Distance (EMD) [4], a sampled version of the transportation problem, is also formulated by a linear program that may be solved by optimal assignment. For the EMD and other typical assignment problems, the computational complexity is more demanding, for example using the Hungarian algorithm it has anO(N3) complexity, whereN = n+m is the number of vertices [5]. Contrarily, graph G, which describes P\u0302V, is a simple bipartite graph for which maximum cardinality matching, a much simpler problem, can be applied to find the optimal assignment. To find the optimal assignment, first solve the maximum matching on the partial graph between vertices xi, yj that have zero weight edges (corresponding to neighboring vertices). Then, assign vertices xi and yj for whom a match was not found with wi and vj respectively; see Algorithm 1 and Figure 1 for an illustration of a matching. It is easy to see that the solution obtained solves the assignment problem associated with P\u0302V.\nThe complexity of Algorithm 1 amounts to the complexity of the maximal matching step and of setting up the graph, i.e., additional O(nm) complexity of computing distances between all points. Let k be the average number of neighbors of a sample, then the average number of edges in the bipartite graph G\u0302 is |E\u0302| = n \u00d7 k. The maximal cardinality matching of this graph is obtained in O(kn \u221a (n+m)) steps, in the worst case [5]."}, {"heading": "3 Related Work", "text": "Many scores have been defined for testing discrepancy between distributions. We focus on representative works for nonparametric tests that are most related to our work. First, we consider statistics for the Two Sample Problem (TSP), i.e., equality testing, that are based on the asymptotic distribution of the statistic conditioned on the equality. Among these tests is the well known Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (for one dimensional distributions), and its generalization to higher dimensions by minimal spanning trees [6]. A different statistic is defined by the portion of k-nearest neighbors of each sample that belongs to different distributions; larger portions mean the distributions are closer [7]. These scores are well known in the statistical literature but cannot be easily changed to test similarity, as their analysis relies on testing equality.\nAs discussed earlier, the 1st Wasserstein metric and the TV metric have some relation to the PV. The EMD and histogram based L1 distance are the sample based estimates of these metrics respectively. In both cases, the distance is not estimated directly on the samples, but on a higher level partition of the space: histogram bins or signatures (cluster centers). As a result, these estimators have inaccuracies. Contrarily, the PV is estimated directly on the samples and converges to its value between the underlying continuous distributions. We note that after a good choice of signatures, the EMD captures perceptual similarity, similar to that of the PV. However, due to the abstraction to signatures, the EMD does not converge to the Wasserstein metric between the continuous distributions, and therefore is commonly used to rate distances and not for statistical testing. It is possible to consider the PV as a refinement of the EMD notion of similarity; instead of clustering the data to signatures and moving the signatures, it perturbs each sample. In this manner it captures a finer notion of the perceptual similarity.\nThe partition of the support to bins allows some relaxation of the TV notion. Therefore, instead of the TV, it may be interesting to consider the L1 as a similarity distance on the measures after discretization. The example in Figure (2) shows that this relaxation is quite rigid and that there is no single partition that captures the perceptual similarity. In general, the problem would remain even if bins with varying width were permitted. Namely, the problem is the choice of a single partition to measure similarity of a reference distribution to multiple distributions, while choosing multiple partitions would make the distances incomparable. Also note that defining a \u201cgood\u201d partition is a difficult task, which is exasperated in higher dimensions.\nThe last group of statistics are scores established in machine learning: the dA distance presented by Kifer et al. that is based on the maximum discrepancy on a chosen subset of the support [8], and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) by Gretton et al., which define discrepancy after embeddings the distributions to a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)[9]. These scores have corresponding statistical tests for the TSP; however, since their analysis is based on finite convergence bounds, in principle they may be modified to test similarity. The dA captures some intuitive notion of similarity, however, to our knowledge, it is not known how to compute it for a general subset class 1. The MMD captures the distance between the samples in some RKHS. While this distance perfectly defines an equality test, it is not clear if it translates to a well defined similarity test. As an example, consider testing if the MMD is grater than some value larger than zero using the RBF kernel. To do so, the parameter \u03c3 must be chosen in advance. Clearly, the result of the test is highly dependent on this choice, but it is not clear how it should be made. Contrarily, the PV\u2019s parameter is related to the data\u2019s input domain and may be chosen accordingly."}, {"heading": "4 Analysis", "text": "We present sample rate convergence analysis of the PV. The proofs of the theorems are provided in the supplementary material. When no clarity is lost, we omit d from the notation. Our main theorem is stated as follows: Theorem 3. Suppose we are given two i.i.d. samples S1 = {x1, ..., xn} \u2208 Rd and S2 = {y1, ..., ym} \u2208 Rd generated by distributions P and Q, respectively. Let the ground distance be d = \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e and let N ( ) be the cardinality of a disjoint cover of the distributions\u2019 support. Then, for any \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1), N = min(n,m), and \u03b7 = \u221a 2(log(2(2N( )\u22122))+log(1/\u03b4))\nN we have that P (\u2223\u2223\u2223P\u0302V (S1, S2, )\u2212 PV (P,Q, )\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u03b7) \u2265 1\u2212 \u03b4.\nThe theorem is defined using \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e, but can be rewritten for other metrics (with a slight change of constants). The proof of the theorem exploits the form of the optimization Problem 3. We use the bound of Theorem 3 construct hypothesis tests. A weakness of this bound is its strong dependency on the dimension. Specifically, it is dependent onN ( ), which for \u2016\u00b7\u2016\u221e isO((1/ )d): the number of disjoint boxes of volume d that cover the support. Unfortunately, this convergence rate is inherent; namely, without making any further assumptions on the distribution, this rate is unavoidable and is an instance of the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d. In the following theorem, we present a lower bound on the convergence rate.\n1Most work with the dA has been with the subset of characteristic functions, and approximated by the error of a classifier.\nTheorem 4. Let P = Q be the uniform distribution on Sd\u22121, a unit (d \u2212 1)\u2013dimensional hypersphere. Let S1 = {x1, ..., xN} \u223c P and S2 = {y1, ..., yN} \u223c Q be two i.i.d. samples. For any , \u2032, \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1), 0 \u2264 \u03b7 < 2/3 and sample size log(1/\u03b4)2(1\u22123\u03b7/2)2 \u2264 N \u2264 \u03b7 2e d(1\u2212 22 )/2, we have PV (P,Q, \u2032) = 0 and\nP(P\u0302V (S1, S2, ) > \u03b7) \u2265 1\u2212 \u03b4. (4)\nFor example, for \u03b4 = 0.01, \u03b7 = 0.5, for any 37 \u2264 N \u2264 0.25ed(1\u2212 2\n2 )/2 we have that P\u0302V > 0.5 with probability at least 0.99. The theorem shows that, for this choice of distributions, for a sample size that is smaller than O(ed), there is a high probability that the value of P\u0302V is far form PV.\nIt can be observed that the empirical estimate P\u0302V is stable, that is, it is almost identical for two data sets differing on one sample. Due to its stability, applying McDiarmid inequality yields the following. Theorem 5. Let S1 = {x1, ..., xn} \u223c P and S2 = {y1, ..., ym} \u223c Q be two i.i.d. samples. Let n \u2265 m, then for any \u03b7 > 0\nP ( |P\u0302V (S1, S2, )\u2212 E[P\u0302V (n,m, )]| \u2265 \u03b7 ) \u2264 e\u2212\u03b7 2m2/4n,\nwhere E[P\u0302V (n,m, )] is the expectation of P\u0302V for a given sample size.\nThis theorem shows that the sample estimate of the PV converges to its expectation without dependence on the dimension. By combining this result with Theorem 3 it may be deduced that only the convergence of the bias \u2013 the difference |E[P\u0302V(n,m, )]\u2212PV(P,Q, )| \u2013 may be exponential in the dimension. This convergence is distribution dependent. However, intuitively, slow convergence is not always the case, for example when the support of the distributions lies in a lower dimensional manifold of the space. To remedy this dependency we propose a bootstrapping bias correcting technique, presented in Section 5. A different possibility is to project the data to one dimension; due to space limitations, this extension of the PV is left out of the scope of this paper and presented in Appendix A.2 in the supplementary material."}, {"heading": "5 Statistical Inference", "text": "We construct two types of complementary procedures for hypothesis testing of similarity and dissimilarity2. In the first type of procedures, given 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < 1, we distinguish between the null hypothesis H(1)0 : PV(P,Q, ,d) \u2264 \u03b8, which implies similarity, and the alternative hypothesis H(1)1 : PV(P,Q, ,d) > \u03b8. Notice that when \u03b8 = 0, this test is a relaxed version of the TSP. Using PV(P,Q) = 0 instead of P = Q as the null, allows for some distinction between the distributions, which gives the needed relaxation to capture similarity. In the second type of procedures, we test whether two distributions are similar. To do so, we flip the role of the null and the alternative. Note that there isn\u2019t an equivalent of this form for the TSP, therefore we can not infer similarity using the TSP test, but only reject equality. Our hypothesis tests are based on the finite sample analysis presented in Section 4; see Appendix A.1 in the supplementary material for the procedures.\nTo provide further inference on the PV, we apply bootstrapping for approximations of Confidence Intervals (CI). The idea of bootstrapping for estimating CIs is based on a two step procedure: approximation of the sampling distribution of the statistic by resampling with replacement from the initial sample \u2013 the bootstrap stage \u2013 following, a computation of the CI based on the resulting distribution. We propose to estimate the CI by Bootstrap Bias-Corrected accelerated (BCa) interval, which adjusts the simple percentile method to correct for bias and skewness [10]. The BCa is known for its high accuracy; particularly, it can be shown, that the BCa interval converges to the theoretical CI with rate O(N\u22121), where N is the sample size. Using the CI, a hypothesis test may be formed: the nullH(1)0 is rejected with significance \u03b1 if the range [0, \u03b8] 6\u2282 [CI,CI]. Also, for the second test, we apply the principle of CI inclusion [11], which states that if [CI,CI] \u2282 [0, \u03b8], dissimilarity is rejected and similarity deduced.\n2The two procedures are distinct, as, in general, lacking evidence to reject similarity is not sufficient to infer dissimilarity, and vice versa.\n10 2\n10 3\n10 4\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nSample size\nT yp\ne\u2212 2\ner ro\nr\n\u03b5=0.1 \u03b5=0.2 \u03b5=0.3 \u03b5=0.4 \u03b5=0.5\n(a) The Type-2 error for varying perturbation sizes and values.\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nRecall\nP re\nci si\non\nPV MMD FR KNN\n(b) Precision-Recall: Gait data.\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nRecall\nP re\nci si\non\nPV MMD FR KNN\n(c) Precision-Recall: Video clips."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments", "text": ""}, {"heading": "6.1 Synthetic Simulations", "text": "In our first experiment, we examine the effect of the choice of on the statistical power of the test.

Lastly, each frame of a video was transformed to a 32- RGB representation. We computed the similarity rate for each query video to all videos in the set, and ranked the position of each video. The results show that the PV and the KNN score are invariant to most of the transformations, and outperform the FR and MMD methods (Table 1 and Figure 3(c)). We found that brightness changes were most problematic for the PV. For this type of distortion, the simple RGB representation is not sufficient to capture the similarity.\nWe also tested gait similarity of female and male subjects; same gender samples are assumed similar. We used gait data that was recorded by a mobile phone, available at [13]. The data consists of two sets of 15min walks of 20 individuals, 10 women and 10 men. As features we used the magnitude of the triaxial accelerometer.We cut the raw data to intervals of approximately 0.5secs, without identification of gait cycles. In this manner, each walk is represented by a collection of about 1500 intervals. An initial scaling to [0,1] was performed once for the whole set. The comparison was done by ranking by gender the 39 samples with respect to a reference walk.\nThe precision-recall curves in Figure 3(b) show that the PV is able to retrieve with higher precision in the mid-recall range. For the early recall points the PV did not show optimal performance; Interestingly, we found that with a smaller , the PV had better performance on early recall points. This behavior reflects the flexibility of the PV: smaller should be chosen when the goal is to find very similar instances, and larger when the goal is to find higher level similarity. The MAP results presented in Table 1 show that the PV had better performance on the female subjects. From examination of the subject information sheet we found that the range of weight and hight within the female group is 50-77Kg and 1.6-1.8m, while within the male group it is 47-100Kg and 1.65-1.93m; that is, there is much more variability in the male group. This information provides a reasonable explanation to the PV results, as it appears that a subject from the male group may have a gait that is as dissimilar to the gait of a female subject as it is to a different male. In the female group the subjects are more similar and therefore the precision is higher."}, {"heading": "7 Discussion", "text": "We proposed a new score that measures the similarity between two multivariate distributions, and assigns to it a value in the range [0,1]. The sensitivity of the score, reflected by the parameter , allows for flexibility that is essential for quantifying the notion of similarity. The PV is efficiently estimated from samples. Its low computational complexity relies on its simple binary classification of points as neighbors or non-neighbor points, such that optimization of distances of faraway points is not needed. In this manner, the PV captures only the essential information to describe similarity. Although it is not a metric, our experiments show that it captures the distance between similar distributions as well as well known distributional distances. Our work also includes convergence analysis of the PV. Based on this analysis we provide hypothesis tests that give statistical significance to the resulting score. While our bounds are dependent on the dimension, when the intrinsic dimension of the data is smaller than the domains dimension, statistical power can be gained by bootstrapping. In addition, the PV has an intuitive interpretation that makes it an attractive score for a meaningful statistical testing of similarity. Lastly, an added value of the PV is that its computation also gives insight to the areas of discrepancy; namely, the areas of the unmatched samples. In future work we plan to further explore this information, which may be valuable on its own merits."}, {"heading": "A Supplementary Material", "text": ""}, {"heading": "A.1 Hypothesis Testing Procedures", "text": "The statistical tests in this section are based on the convergence bounds in Section 4.\nNotations Throughout this section the probabilities P0 and P1 represent the probability conditioned on the null hypothesisH0, and the alternative hypothesisH1.\nThe following procedure tests the hypothesis H(1)0 : PV(P,Q, ) \u2264 \u03b8 against the alternative H (1) 1 : PV(P,Q, ) > \u03b8.\nProcedure 1. Similarity Testing Based on P\u0302V. Input: , \u03b8 and significance level \u03b1.\n1. Sample S1 = {x1, ..., xn} \u223c P and S2 = {y1, ..., ym} \u223c Q (define N = min(n,m)). 2. Normalize the data to be in [0, 1]d.\n3. Compute P\u0302 V (S1, S2, , \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e) by Algorithm 1. 4. Compute t = \u221a\n(2 log(2(2(1/ )d\u22122))+2 log(1/\u03b1) N .\nOutput: RejectH(1)0 if P\u0302 V (S1, S2, , \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e) > t+ \u03b8\n.\nThe probability to reject H(1)0 by applying Procedure 1 when in fact it holds \u2013 also known as the Type 1 error \u2013 is bounded in the following corollary.\nCorollary 6. Assume that for a given and \u03b8 values H(1)0 : PV (P,Q, ,d) \u2264 \u03b8 holds. Then for the threshold t of Procedure 1 and any \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) we have that\nP0 ( P\u0302 V (S1, S2, , \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e) \u2265 t+ \u03b8 ) \u2264 \u03b1. (5)\nMoreover, the procedure is consistent: when n,m \u2192 \u221e we have that t \u2192 0 and P1(P\u0302 V (S1, S2, , \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e) > \u03b8) = 1.\nThe corollary is a direct result of Theorem 3.\nNext, we consider the probability that Procedure 1 fails to rejectH(1)0 when the alternative hypothesis H(1)1 holds, also known as the Type 2 error. Unfortunately, it is not possible to bound this probability for a finite sample of any two distributions. To see this, consider the following example: let P,Q be two distributions with PV (P,Q, ) > 0, but differ only in an area of very low probability. Then, for any finite sample size, there is a high probability that the samples are identical, resulting in P\u0302 V (S1, S2, ) = 0. As a result, the null hypothesis will not be rejected even thoughH(1)1 holds. However, if the PV is larger than some constant the Type 2 error is bounded. Corollary 7. For PV (P,Q, ,d) > \u03b8 + t + b, with t of Procedure 1, and b =\u221a\n2(log(2(2(1/ )d\u22122))+2 log(1/\u03b2) N we have that P ( P\u0302 V (S1, S2, , \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e) > t+ \u03b8 ) \u2265 1\u2212 \u03b2.\nNote that as N grows, the values of b and t get smaller, and the lower bound PV (P,Q, ,d) > \u03b8 + t+ b decreases.\nProof. We have that P1 ( P\u0302 V (S1, S2, , \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e) > t+ \u03b8 ) = P1 ( P\u0302 V (S1, S2, , \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e) > b+ t+ \u03b8 \u2212 b ) \u2265\nP ( P\u0302 V (S1, S2, , \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e) > PV (P,Q, , \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e)\u2212 b ) \u2265 1\u2212 \u03b2.\nThe first inequality holds by inserting the assumption on PV , and the second holds by applying the convergence bound of Theorem 3.\nTo give an estimate of the sample size needed for the procedure, first define the effect size \u03b80: the minimal value of PV that is significant. Given \u03b80, set the sample size so that\nN \u2265 4 log(2(2 (1/ )d \u2212 2)) + 2 log(1/\u03b1) + 2 log(1/\u03b2)\n\u03b820 .\nUsing this size ensures a false positive rate bounded by \u03b1 (Corollary 6), and a false negative rate bounded by \u03b2 (Corollary 7).\nThe second test we consider is an equivalence type test [11]. Equivalence is achieved when PV(P,Q, ) < \u03b8, for some chosen \u03b8, and may be obtained by switching the roles of the null and the alternative of Procedure 1. Namely, to claim similarity we need to rejectH(2)0 : PV(P,Q, ) \u2265 \u03b8. To test this hypothesis, a similar procedure to Procedure 1 may be applied, with a principal difference in the rejection area, which is changed to P\u0302 V (S1, S2, , \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e) < \u03b8 \u2212 t.\nA.2 1D Projections\nWe present a method to gain insight on the value of the PV by multiple random projections to one dimension. The PV between two distributions is not retained after projection to a single dimension, as the projection contracts the distance between the points. However, we show that multiple projections can still aid to distinguish between two situations: PV(P,Q, ) = 0 and PV(P,Q, ) 6= 0 4. First, we define a score that is based on the value of the PV after projections.\nDefinition 8. Let fi : Rd \u2192 R for i = 1, ...,K, define random projection mappings. Let X and Y be random variables with distributions P and Q. The maximum projected score of two distributions P and Q is\nPPVK(P,Q, ) = max i=1,...,K PV(fi(X), fi(Y ), )."}, {"heading": "For two samples S1 \u223c P and S2 \u223c Q the score is", "text": "P\u0302PVK(S1, S2, ) = max i=1,...,K P\u0302V(fi(S1), fi(S2), ).\nThe next theorem presents the convergence of P\u0302PVK to zero for distributions with PV (P,Q) = 0.\nTheorem 9. Let P and Q be two distributions on the space ([0, 1]d,d), and S1 = {x1, ..., xn} \u223c P and S2 = {y1, ..., ym} \u223c Q two i.i.d. samples (N = min(n,m)). Perform K i.i.d. random projections of samples S1 and S2 to one dimension. If PV (P,Q, ,d) = 0, then for any \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1), with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4\nP\u0302PVK(S1, S2, ) \u2264 \u221a\n2 log(2K(21/ \u2212 2)/\u03b4) N .\nProof. Given PV (P,Q, ,d) = 0, we have that for all K projections PPV1i(P,Q, , | \u00b7 |) = PV (P,Q, ,d) = 0, as the projection to 1D is a non-expansion.\nIn the following we denote by P0(A) the probability of event A under the assumption PV (P,Q, ,d) = 0. Denote P\u0302PVi( ) = P\u0302V(fi(S1), fi(S2), ) as the value of PV obtained due to the ith projection.\nWe bound the probability of the event P\u0302PVK(S1, S2, ) \u2265 \u03b7:\nP0 (\nmax 1\u2264i\u2264K\nP\u0302PV i( ) \u2265 \u03b7 ) = P0 ( \u22031 \u2264 i \u2264 K : P\u0302PV i( ) \u2265 \u03b7 ) \u2264 K\u2211 i=1 P0 ( P\u0302PV i( ) \u2265 \u03b7 ) ,\n(6)\n4Recall that PV=0 not only when the distributions are equal, but also when they are similar.\nwhere the last inequality is obtained by applying the union bound.\nCombining (6) with Theorem 3, we have that for any \u03b7 \u2208 (0, 1) P0 (\nmax 1\u2264i\u2264K\nP\u0302PV i( ) \u2265 \u03b7 ) \u2264 K max 1\u2264i\u2264K P0 ( P\u0302PV i( ) \u2265 \u03b7 ) \u2264 2K(21/ \u2212 2)e\u2212N\u03b7 2/2.\nSetting \u03b4 = 2K(21/ \u2212 2)e\u2212N\u03b72/2 concludes the proof.\nFor PV(P,Q) > 0 , we provide a similar lower bound on the maximum score. We will need a further assumption for this bound. Assumption 1. Given distributions P and Q with PV(P,Q, ) > 0, they are 1D distinguishable if limK\u2192\u221e PPVK(P,Q, ) > 0 almost surely.\nThis assumption ensures that the difference in the PV value exists in at least one projection. Theorem 10. Let P and Q be two distributions on the space ([0, 1]d,d). Given i = 1, ...,K i.i.d. samples Si1 = {xi1, ..., xin} \u223c P and Si2 = {yi1, ..., yim} \u223c Q, and K mappings fi, for any two distribution that fulfill Assumption 1 there exists some q \u2208 (0, 1), for which for any \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1) with probability at least 1\u2212 (q \u2212 q\u03b4 + \u03b4)K\nP\u0302PV({Si1}, {Si2}, ) \u2265 \u221a\n2 log(2K(21/ \u2212 2)/\u03b4) N .\nThe notation P\u0302PV({Si1}, {Si2}, ) denotes the maximum taken over the projections of the K sets. Notice that q \u2212 q\u03b4 + \u03b4 < 1, and therefore is an exponential decay in the number of projections K.\nProof. Let f : Rd \u2192 R define a random projection mappings. Let X and Y be random variables generated by P and Q. Denote PV1 = PV(f(X), f(Y ), ), and P\u0302V1( ) = P\u0302V(f(S1), f(S2), ). Note that there are two sources of randomization, the sample\u2019s and the projection\u2019s, and therefore PV1 is also a random variable.\nWe have that\nP(P\u0302PV({Si1}, {Si2}, ) \u2264 \u03b7) = P( max 1\u2264i\u2264K P\u0302V(fi(Si1), fi(Si2), ) \u2264 \u03b7) = (7)\nP(\u2200 1 \u2264 i \u2264 K , P\u0302V(fi(Si1), fi(Si2), ) \u2264 \u03b7) = [P(P\u0302V1( ) \u2264 \u03b7)]K , where the last equality holds due to the independence of the events. Next, we bound the probability P(P\u0302V1( ) \u2264 \u03b7). We define complementary events A : PV1( ) \u2265 2\u03b7 and Ac : PV1( ) < 2\u03b7.\nP(P\u0302V1( ) \u2264 \u03b7) = P (A)P (P\u0302V1( ) \u2264 \u03b7 |A) + P (Ac)P (P\u0302V1( ) \u2264 \u03b7 |Ac) (8) \u2264 P (A)P ( P\u0302V1( ) \u2264 PV1 \u2212 \u03b7 |A ) + P (Ac)P ( P\u0302V1( ) \u2264 \u03b7 |Ac )\n\u2264 P (A)2(21/ \u2212 2)e\u2212N\u03b7 2/2 + P (Ac) \u2264 P (A)2K(21/ \u2212 2)e\u2212N\u03b7 2/2 + 1\u2212 P (A).\nThe inequality before last is obtained by applying Theorem 3 for any \u03b7 \u2208 (0, 1). For \u03b4 = 2K(21/ \u2212 2)e\u2212N\u03b7\u0303 2/2 we have \u03b7\u0303 = \u221a\n2 log(2K(21/ \u22122)\u03b4) N . Substituting this \u03b7\u0303 to (8) results in\nP(PV1( ) \u2264 \u03b7\u0303) \u2264 1\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b4)P (A). (9)\nLet p(\u03b7, ) = P(PV1(P,Q, ) \u2264 \u03b7) be the distribution of the projected PV. Clearly, p(\u03b7, ) depends on the generating distributions P and Q, and its support is [0, supi(PPVi(P,Q, ))]. We assume that supi(PPVi(P,Q, )) > 0, and therefore there must be some q \u2208 (0, 1) for which\nP(PV1(P,Q, ) < 2\u03b7\u0303) \u2264 q. (10)\nCombining the results of (7), (9) and (10), we have that for any 0 < \u03b4 < 1\nP(P\u0302PV({Si1}, {Si2}, ) \u2264 \u03b7\u0303) \u2264 (1\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b4)P(PV1( ) \u2265 2\u03b7\u0303))K \u2264 (q \u2212 q\u03b4 + \u03b4)K .\nTherefore, with probability at least 1\u2212 (q \u2212 q\u03b4 + \u03b4)K P\u0302PV({Si1}, {Si2}, ) \u2265 \u221a\n2 log(2K(21/ \u2212 2)/\u03b4) N .\nNote that for any q < 1 results in q \u2212 q\u03b1 + \u03b1 < 1, and therefore we get exponential decay. For example for q = 1/2 (2\u03b7\u0303 is smaller then the median) we have (q \u2212 q\u03b4 + \u03b4)K = ( 1+\u03b4 2 )K .\nTheorems 9 and 10 are complementary, and may be used together to infer whether or not PV(P,Q) = 0. Next, we describe the suitable hypothesis testing procedure for this goal. Procedure 2 provides statistical tests based on the score P\u0302PVK (Definition 8). The procedure tests an hypothesis of the first type with \u03b8 = 0: H(1)0 : PV (P,Q, ) = 0 againstH (1) 1 : PV (P,Q, ) > 0.\nProcedure 2. Similarity testing based on P\u0302PVK . Input: level, number of projections K, and significance level \u03b1. For i = 1, ...,K do\n1. Sample Si1 = {x1, ..., xn} \u223c P and Si2 = {y1, ..., ym} \u223c Q i.i.d. examples on [0, 1]d. 2. Sample a unit random vector ri \u2208 Sd\u22121. 3. Project to 1D: Psi1 = {rTi x1, ..., rTi xn} and Psi2 = {rTi y1, ..., rTi ym}. 4. Compute P\u0302V(Psi1, Psi2, ).\nend for Compute P\u0302PVK = maxi=1,...,K P\u0302V(Psi1, Psi2, ). Compute t = \u221a\nlog(K)+2 log(2(21/ \u22122))+2 log(1/\u03b1) N , for N = min(n,m).\nOutput: RejectH0 if P\u0302PVK > t.\nThe next corollary bounds the Type 1 error of Procedure 2, and shows that the test is consistent. Corollary 11. Assume that the null hypothesis holds: H0 : PV (P,Q, ,d) = 0. Then, for the threshold t of Procedure 2 and any \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) we have that\nP0 ( P\u0302PVK(S1, S2, ) \u2265 t ) \u2264 \u03b1. (11)\nMoreover, when N \u2192\u221e,K \u2192\u221e and log(K)N \u2192 0 we have that P1(P\u0302PVK(S1, S2, ) > t) = 1.\nThe bound is obtained by Theorem 9. The consistency is conditioned on Assumption 1, and obtained by Theorem 10.\nTheorem 10 bounds the Type 2 error of Procedure 2, which is dependent on the number of projections K, and the fraction q that is distribution dependent. The bound exponentially decays as K grows, and therefore, to gain statistical power, a larger number of projections can be used."}, {"heading": "A.3 Proof of Theorem 3", "text": "We restate the theorem for clarity: Theorem 3.

The proofs of the lammas are presented immediately after the proof of the theorem. We assume the domain is totally bounded, and, for simplicity of presentation, we assume the metric space is ([0, 1]d,d\u221e = \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e). We define a discretization on the support of the distributions. Definition 12 (Discretization). The -discretization over the space ([0, 1]d,d\u221e = \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e) is a partition on the set C( ) = {a1, ..., aN}, with cardinality N = (1/ )d. Each element in C( ) is the center of a box of volume d. The boxes do not intersect, and their union covers [0, 1]d. Each ai \u2208 C( ) has a density equal to the distribution\u2019s mass in its neighborhood: B(ai,d\u221e, ) = {z : d\u221e(ai, z) \u2264 /2}.\nWe refer to the resulting discretized versions of the distributions P and Q as \u00b51( ), \u00b52( ) respectively. Also, let \u00b5\u03021( ), \u00b5\u03022( ) be the histograms of the samples S1 and S2, defined on the -discretization C( ).\nThe proof of Theorem 3 is based on formulating the relations between P\u0302V(S1, S2) and PV(\u00b5\u03021, \u00b5\u03021), and between PV (P,Q) and PV (\u00b51, \u00b52); then, turning to the discrete versions, bounding the difference between PV(\u00b5\u03021, \u00b5\u03021) and PV (\u00b51, \u00b52).\nThe relation between the different versions of the PV, continuous, discrete and sampled, is provided in the next lemma. Lemma 13. Let S1 = {x1, ..., xn} \u223c P and S2 = {y1, ..., ym} \u223c Q be two samples. Let \u00b51(\u03bd) and \u00b52(\u03bd) be the \u03bd-discretizations of P and Q for any integer T > 1 and \u03bd = T . Let \u00b5\u03021(\u03bd) and \u00b5\u03022(\u03bd) be their empirical distributions. The following relations hold for any , \u2032 = (T\u22121) T ,\n\u2032\u2032 = (T+1) T and d = \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e :\nPV(\u00b5\u03021, \u00b5\u03022, \u2032\u2032) \u2264 P\u0302V(S1, S2, ) \u2264 PV(\u00b5\u03021, \u00b5\u03022, \u2032) (12) PV(\u00b51, \u00b52, \u2032\u2032) \u2264 PV(P,Q, ) \u2264 PV(\u00b51, \u00b52, \u2032). (13)\nWe use the following structure of two discretizations. Definition 14 (Refinement of a discretization). Define an initial -discretization C1( ) = {b1, ..., bN( )} on ([0, 1]d, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e). The refinement of the discretization, for any and T > 1, is defined as a \u03bd-discretization on C2(\u03bd) = {a1, ..., aN(\u03bd)}, where \u03bd = /T , such that each element of the refinement is a result of splitting an element of the initial cover to ( /T )d elements of equal volume.\nThe next lemma bounds the difference between the PV on the discrete distributions \u00b5\u03021(\u03bd), \u00b5\u03022(\u03bd) and the distributions \u00b51(\u03bd) and \u00b52(\u03bd). Lemma 15. Let C1( ) be an -discretization on [0, 1]d, and C2(\u03bd) its refined discretization (Definition 14). Let \u00b5\u0302i( ) and \u00b5i( ) be distributions on C1( ), and \u00b5\u0302i(\u03bd) and \u00b5i(\u03bd) distributions on the refinement C2(\u03bd).

Lemma 13\nLet sample xi \u2208 S1 belong to the element ak in the \u03bd-discretization, that is xi \u2208 B(ak, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e, \u03bd = T ). Recall that the -neighborhood of a sample xi is the set ng(xi, ) = {z : d(xi, z) \u2264 }, and the (T+1) T -neighborhood of bin ak is the set ng(ak, (T+1) T ) = {z : d(ak, z) \u2264 (T+1) T }. For the left side of (12), observe that for any such xi there exists values of z such that \u2016z \u2212 ak\u2016\u221e \u2264 (T+1)T\nbut \u2016z \u2212 xi\u2016\u221e > , while for any z for which \u2016z \u2212 xi\u2016\u221e \u2264 also \u2016z \u2212 ak\u2016\u221e \u2264 (T+1)T . As a result, ng(xi, ) \u2286 ng(ak, (T+1)T ). Enlarging the number of neighbors adds edges to the bipartite graph describing the problem, and accordingly, a matching with a larger cardinality may be found. In such a case, the number of unmatched samples is decreased, and therefore the PV is decreased, as it is the normalized sum of the unmatched samples.\nFor the right hand side of (12), observe that when the discretization is (T\u22121)T , for any point xi \u2208 B(ak, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e, \u03bd) we have that ng(xi, ) \u2287 ng(ak, (T\u22121)T ), as the -neighborhood of each point mass encloses the (T\u22121)T -neighborhood of its ascribed bin. As a result, the PV between the histograms \u00b5\u03021 and \u00b5\u03022 may correspond to a graph that has less edges, which may result in a maximum matching with a smaller cardinality. As a result, the discrete version may have a larger PV. Inequalities (13) hold, as the same claims apply for the discretization of the distributions.\nThe following representation of Problem (2) will be useful for the proof of Lemma 15.\nLemma 17. The solution of Problem (2) may be obtained by solving the following problem\nmin wi,vi,Zij\n1\n2 N\u2211 i=1 |wi|+ 1 2 N\u2211 j=1\n|vj | (18)\u2211 aj\u2208ng(ai, ) Zij + wi = \u00b51(ai), i = 1, ..., N\n\u2211 ai\u2208ng(aj , ) Zij + vj = \u00b52(aj), j = 1, ..., N\nZij \u2265 0, \u2200i, j,\nwhich we call PVeq(\u00b51(\u03bd), \u00b52(\u03bd), ).\nThe lemma states that the constraints wi \u2265 0, vj \u2265 0 may be removed, and instead the sum in the objective is taken over the absolute values.\nProof. Lemma 17\nFirst note that any solution of Problem (2) is a feasible solution of Problem (18), and so we have that the optimum PV(\u00b51(\u03bd), \u00b52(\u03bd), ) \u2265 PVeq(\u00b51(\u03bd), \u00b52(\u03bd), ). We construct a solution of (2) that realizes the equality, and therefore is optimal. Namely, to show the problems are equivalent it is sufficient to show that any solution of (18) has a corresponding solution of (2) with the same objective value.\nLet wi, vj , Zij be the solution to (18). In the following, we construct a feasible solution w\u0303i, v\u0303i, Z\u0303ij to (2):\nIf wi < 0 and vi > 0 set \u2206i = |wi| and w\u0303i = wi + \u2206i = 0, v\u0303i = vi + \u2206i > 0, \u2211\naj\u2208ng(ai)\nZ\u0303ij = \u2211\naj\u2208ng(ai)\nZij \u2212\u2206i.\nIf vi < 0 and wi > 0 set \u0393j = |vj | and v\u0303i = vi + \u0393i = 0, w\u0303i = wi + \u0393i > 0, \u2211\naj\u2208ng(ai)\nZ\u0303ji = \u2211\naj\u2208ng(ai)\nZji \u2212 \u0393i.\nIf both wi < 0 and vi < 0 set w\u0303i = wi + \u2206i + \u0393i > 0, v\u0303i = vi + \u2206i + \u0393i > 0, \u2211\naj\u2208ng(ai)\n(Z\u0303ij + Z\u0303ji) = \u2211\naj\u2208ng(ai)\n(Zij + Zji)\u2212\u2206i \u2212 \u0393i.\nOtherwise, set w\u0303i = wi, v\u0303j = vj , and Z\u0303ij = Zij .\nThe resulting w\u0303i, v\u0303j , Z\u0303ij obey the equality constraints in (2) while fixing w\u0303i \u2265 0, v\u0303j \u2265 0. It is easy to show that there exists Z\u0303ij \u2265 0 that obeys the equalities above. The objective value of (18) with\nwi, vj , Zij and of (2) with w\u0303i, v\u0303j , Z\u0303ij is equal: N\u2211 i=1 w\u0303i + N\u2211 j=1 v\u0303j = N\u2211 i=1 (wi + vi)1[wi\u22650 , vi\u22650] + N\u2211 i=1 ((wi + \u2206i) + vi + \u2206i)1[wi<0 , vi\u22650]+\nN\u2211 j=1 (wj + \u0393j + (vj + \u0393j))1[wj\u22650 , vj<0] + N\u2211 i=1 ((wi + \u2206i + \u0393i) + (vi + \u0393i + \u2206i))1[wi<0 , vi<0]\n= N\u2211 i=1 |wi|+ N\u2211 j=1 |vj |.\nWe conclude that w\u0303i, v\u0303j , Z\u0303ij attains the optimal solution to Problem (2).\nProof. Lemma 15\nLet Z\u2217ij , w \u2217 i , v \u2217 j be the optimal arguments for which PV(\u00b51, \u00b52, ) is obtained (Problem (2)). There are two stages to bounding the difference between PV(\u00b51, \u00b52, ) and PV(\u00b5\u03021, \u00b5\u03022, ). First, by Lemma 17 we know that given a solution PVeq(\u00b5\u03021, \u00b5\u03022, ) we can find an equivalent solution PV(\u00b5\u03021, \u00b5\u03022, ). As a result, we may bound the difference between PV(\u00b51, \u00b52, ) and PVeq(\u00b5\u03021, \u00b5\u03022, ) instead of the difference between PV(\u00b51, \u00b52, ) and PV(\u00b5\u03021, \u00b5\u03022, ). To bound this difference, we change the solution Z\u2217ij , w \u2217 i , v \u2217 j to describe a feasible solution to Problem (18) for distributions \u00b5\u03021 and \u00b5\u03022.\nTo obtain a feasible solution to Problem (18), we must fix the violations that are made to its constraints by substituting Z\u2217ij , w \u2217 i , v \u2217 j into Problem (18). The constraints are fixed in two manners. Some constraints are fixed by optimizing the transportation plan, described by matrix Z, within the refinement of the discretization. Additional violations are fixed by changing the variables wj and vj .\nDefine sk = {ai : ai \u2208 B(bk, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e, )}; i.e., the set of bins ai \u2208 C2(\u03bd) that are a refinement of element bk \u2208 C1( ) (Definition 14). Let |sk| be the cardinality of this set. By definition, all the bins in sk are -neighbors: \u2200ai \u2208 sk, sk \u2208 ng(ai, ). For any ai, aj \u2208 sk, consider the following feasibility problem:\nFind Cij (19)\u2211 aj\u2208sk\nCij = ci, \u2200ai \u2208 sk,\u2211 ai\u2208sk Cij = bj , \u2200aj \u2208 sk,\nZ\u2217ij + Cij \u2265 0, \u2200ai, aj \u2208 sk, where\nci . = (\u00b5\u03021(ai)\u2212 \u00b51(ai))\u2212\n1\n|sk| (\u00b5\u03021(bk)\u2212 \u00b51(bk)),\nbj . = (\u00b5\u03022(aj)\u2212 \u00b52(aj))\u2212\n1\n|sk| (\u00b5\u03022(bk)\u2212 \u00b52(bk)).\nNote that ci and bi may be positive or negative, and that \u2211 ai\u2208sk ci = 0 and \u2211 aj\u2208sk bj = 0.\nWe show that the following values w\u0304i, v\u0304j , Z\u0304ij for i, j = 1, ..., N(\u03bd) are a feasible solution to Problem (18).\nw\u0304i = w \u2217 i +\n1\n|sk| (\u00b5\u03021(bk)\u2212 \u00b51(bk)) (20)\nv\u0304j = v \u2217 j +\n1\n|sk| (\u00b5\u03022(bk)\u2212 \u00b52(bk))\nZ\u0304ij = { Z\u2217ij if aj \u2208 sck, ai \u2208 sk, Z\u2217ij + Cij if aj \u2208 sk, ai \u2208 sk,\nwhere Cij is the solution to the (19).\nFirst, we show that Problem (19) is feasible. To do so, we consider its dual representation. Define v = Vec({Cij}ai,aj\u2208sk) \u2208 R|sk|\n2\u00d71, the vector form of the sub-matrix {Cij}ai,aj\u2208sk . Similarly, let z\u2217 = Vec({Z\u2217ij}ai,aj\u2208sk) \u2208 R|sk|\n2\u00d71. Let A \u2208 R2|sk|\u00d7|sk|2 be the zero-one matrix defined by the left-hand sides of the equality constraints in (19), and d = [c1, ..., c|sk|, b1, ..., b|sk|]\nT \u2208 R2|sk|\u00d71, the vector defined by the right-hand sides of these constraints. Using these notations, Problem (19) is equivalent to\nFind v Av = d , \u2212v \u2212 z\u2217 \u2264 0,\nwhose dual representation is the existence of \u03bb \u2208 R|sk|2\u00d71, \u03b7 \u2208 R2|sk|\u00d71 for which\ng(\u03bb, \u03b7) = inf v \u03bbT (\u2212v \u2212 z\u2217) + \u03b7T (Av \u2212 d) > 0, (21)\n\u03bb \u2265 0.\nThe value of g(\u03bb, \u03b7) in (21) is not \u2212\u221e only when AT \u03b7 \u2212 \u03bb = 0, for which\ng(\u03bb, \u03b7) = inf v \u03bbT (\u2212v \u2212 z\u2217) + \u03b7T (Av \u2212 d) = inf v vT (\u2212\u03bb+AT \u03b7)\u2212 \u03bbT z\u2217 \u2212 \u03b7T d = \u2212\u03bbT z\u2217 \u2212 \u03b7T d.\nSince z\u2217 \u2265 0 and \u03bb \u2265 0, we have that\u2212\u03bbT z\u2217 \u2264 0. By noting that 1T d = \u2211 ai\u2208sk ci+ \u2211 aj\u2208sk bj = 0, we have that \u2212\u03b7T d \u2264 \u2212min \u03b7` \u00b7 1T d = 0. We conclude that g(\u03bb, \u03b7) \u2264 0, and therefore Problem (21) is infeasible. By the theorem of alternatives [15] Problem (19) is feasible.\nNext, we show that the proposed solution Z\u0304ij , w\u0304i, v\u0304j is indeed a feasible solution of Problem (18).
