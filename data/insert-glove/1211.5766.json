INTRODUCTION\nThe exponential growth in the number of documents circulating the web has caused a rapid growth of activity on the Web and an explosion of data resulting from this activity. These data are at a very high percentage of text data that currently represent the support of the information used in web and communication, to do this, a tool of management, organization and analysis of these data is required. This new tool and algorithms had to be proposed to meet the growing needs in terms of extraction and interpretation of knowledge from these data. Data mining or specifically text mining that represents the search of textual data is thus growth in the development of techniques for extracting, manipulating and to formatting the information from the data, so in\neffect this is to automatically extract knowledge from a set of texts (corpus or database)using methods of discovery such as statistics, learning or data analysis. In our study, we are interested in a non-supervised learning problem in which a classification of textual documents is necessary. We have used a bio method inspired the cellular automata that we have already tested with the two dimension (2D) [1,2,3], but in the current study the experimentation is carried out with the three dimension (3D) because we wanted to solve the problem of the spatiality of the structure (do the non-supervised a large number of textual documents classification to large 2D cellular automaton to well represent the resulting clusters) and exploit the power of visualization of cellular automata 3D and its structure. Our work consists of three parts namely, a representation of the data portion, part classification and in the late part of visualization of classes."}, {"heading": "A. Problematic", "text": "The supervised classification problems are: \u2022 Supervised classification requires a lot of human\nresources.\n\u2022 When the number of documents increases, the initial classification is to review resulting in the creation of new classes and change of the criteria of choice.\n\u2022 Little consistent classifications Given the problems that the supervised classification pauses and according to [6] where about 80% of the documents are in text format. This huge volume of unstructured or structured semi gives rise to an act to find relevant information more difficult to achieve, generating a problem known as the problem of information overload [4]. The techniques and tools of knowledge discovery in text (KDT) [7] or simply text mining [6] are being developed to deal with this problem. One of these techniques is the clustering, a technique used to group similar documents of a given collection by assisting in the understanding of its content [8, 9]. One of its objectives is to similar documents in the same group and to place different documents in different groups. The assumption is that, thanks to a process of clustering, similar objects remain in the same group according to the attributes they\nhave in common. This hypothesis is known as the hypothesis of cluster described in [10]. It is important to analyze the difference between clustering and classification processes. Both activities have different purposes and are different in essence: the process of grouping or clustering produces clusters without prior on the content of the document knowledge or which exist classes, while the classification (or categorization) is a process that begins with a predefined set of categories and tries to identify to which category a document belongs [9]. Thus, the clustering helps people to identify classes and build taxonomies. Some advantages of clustering are:\n\u2022 Ability to consolidate large amounts of documents: humans cannot parse many aspects (characteristics) of documents.\n\u2022 The impartiality in the process: human beings have a knowledge base (KB) which tends to bias the process of personal consolidation.\n\u2022 Identification of the common features between documents (models such as words or concepts) : they can be used to understand why these documents in a same cluster are similar and include a collection of documents and its content.\n\u2022 Organization of unstructured documents: clustering minimizes the overload of information (inability to analyze excessive amounts of information) in search of information, grouping similar information (sharing a set of documents), summarizing common characteristics, thus contributing to the user to view the results of a query or search, and help the user navigate through a set of documents automatically.\nIn this study we used and experienced unstructured data in this case the text data. Grouping or clustering of textual documents, in particular Web pages is one of the challenges of current research. This task is similar to the classification of documents structured in a database."}, {"heading": "B. State of the art", "text": "A well designed clustering algorithm follows\ngenerally the four phases of design: the representation of the data, modelling, optimization, and validation [11]. The representation of the data phase predetermines what kind of cluster structures can be found in the data. On the basis of the representation of the data, the modelling phase defines the concept of clusters and criteria that separate structures desired groups of those non-desired or unfavourable ones. In this phase, a measure of quality which can be optimized or approached while searching for hidden in the data structures is produced. In General, traditional clustering algorithms can be classified into two categories: Hierarchical algorithms and Partitioning algorithms. There are two types of hierarchical algorithms: the hierarchical division algorithms and hierarchical algorithms of agglomeration. In a hierarchical division algorithm, the algorithm performs from the top to the bottom, that is to say, the algorithm starts with a large cluster containing all data in all of data points and continues to make splitting of clusters. In algorithm of hierarchical agglomeration, the algorithm proceeds from bottom to top, namely, the algorithm starts\nwith clusters each containing a data point and continues to merge clusters. Unlike the hierarchical algorithms, partitioning algorithms create a level of non-overlapping partitioning of the data points. For large data sets, the hierarchical methods become impractical unless other techniques are integrated, because usually prioritised methods are of complexity O (n2) for space memory and O (n3) for time CPU [12, 13, 14], where n is the number of data in the dataset. Partitioning clustering algorithms attempt to break down all data directly in a series of disjointed groups. They try to optimize a certain test function which can focus on the local structure of the data. As a general rule, criteria of bases are to minimise some measure of dissimilarity in samples of each cluster, while maximizing the dissimilarity of the different clusters. The advantages of hierarchical algorithms are the disadvantages of partitioning algorithms and vice versa. Partitioning clustering algorithms are usually iterative in nature and converge Optima premises and include the k-means, k-m\u00e9do\u00efdes, Fuzzy C-Means, expectation - maximization (EM), k-harmonic means. What really interests us is a State of the art on the clustering using biomimetic methods since our method based on 3D cellular automata which is no other than a biomimetic method. The different types of algorithms which contributed in the field of classification data are: genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming, evolutionary, genetic programming strategies, the immune systems and intelligence in swarm in a comprehensive way. The idea of using genetic algorithms in the area of clustering has its forces to create a population of solutions candidates to an optimization problem, which is iteratively refined by alteration and selection of the right solutions for the next iteration. The candidate solutions are selected according to a fitness function that evaluates their quality. An advantage of these algorithms is their ability to face a local optimum by maintaining, recombination and comparison of multiple solutions simultaneously. In contrast, the heuristics of local research, such as the algorithm of simulated annealing [15], allows refining a single candidate solution and shows a weakness to deal with a local optimum. Determinism of local search, which is used in algorithms such as k-means, always converges to the nearest local optimum of the starting position of the research. Evolutionary or evolution strategies (ES) [16, 17] are optimization techniques based on ideas of adaptation and evolution. The evolution of strategies uses natural representations of dependent problems, and primarily mutation and selection of search operators. As algorithms evolutionary, the operators are applied in a loop. An iteration of the loop is called a generation. The sequence of generations is continued until a decision criterion is reached. The selection in evolution strategies is deterministic and is based only on rankings fitness not on values actual fitness. In the case of the clustering, Lee and Antonsson [18] used an evolution strategy (ES) to a set of data without any prior knowledge of the number of clusters. SLS proposed implements variable length individuals to simultaneously search for centroid and the\nnumber of clusters. Genetic programming (GP), is a methodology of evolutionary algorithm inspired by biological evolution to find computer programs that perform a task set by the user. It is a specialization of genetic algorithms, where each individual is a computer program. The main difference between the genetic programming and genetic algorithms is the representation of the solution. Genetic programming creates computer programs in computer languages Lisp or Scheme as a solution. Genetic algorithms create a string of numbers that represent the solution. The first results on the GP methodology was developed by Smith [20] and Cramer [21]. Koza, however remains the main initiator of the GP and paved the way for the application of genetic programming in complex optimization and various problems of research [19]. The work of Sarkar and al. [22] highlight an approach for classifying data dynamically using evolutionary programming (PE) where two fitness functions are optimized simultaneously. One gives the optimal cluster number, while the other leads to an identification of each cluster centro\u00efd. This algorithm determines the optimal number of clusters and optimal cluster centers such that locally optimal solutions are avoided. Another advantage that this approach is that clustering is here independent of the initial choice of cluster centres in other words independent of initial conditions. However, the proposed method is applicable for the clustering of tasks where the clusters are not overlapping. For immune systems the Data: d1,...,dn represent antigens. These antigens are presented to the system repeatedly until a stop condition. The modelling data is digital, and therefore the antigen is a vector of dimension n. At each iteration, the antigen is presented to enable antibodies (similar, in this modelling, lymphocyte -B). An antibody is also represented by a vector of dimension n. The antibodies close enough to the antigen (in the sense of Euclidean distance) (ie: similar) will undergo clones with mutation (interaction antibody / antigen) to amplify and refine the system response. Also, these antibodies will undergo a selection (interaction antibody / antibodies): those who are too close to each other will be reduced in number. After these iterations, the system converges by placing antibodies (which act as sensors) wisely and number of suitable data. The main ideas used for the design of metaheuristics are operated upon the selections on lymphocytes, accompanied by the positive feedback allowing the multiplication and the memory system. Indeed, these attributes are critical to maintain the properties of self-organized system. With regard to swarm intelligence algorithms found a contribution in the area of clustering in ants and swarm particulate matter such as insects and birds. The behaviour of an Ant, bee, termite and the Wasp is often too simple, but their collective and social behaviour is of paramount importance. Approach to optimization by colonies of ants (Ant Colony Optimization) is a meta heuristics based on the population that can be used to find approximate solutions to difficult optimization problems. The main fields of applications of the COA are the problems of combinatorial optimization NP hard [23].\nSince data classification problems and in particular the clustering is one of these problems then COA was one of the approaches to venture into this area. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) was introduced by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995 [24]. They were inspired by research and simulation of behavior and the social psychology of insects. Research efforts have used to describe clustering as an optimization problem. This view gives us a chance to apply the PSO algorithm to evolve a set of cluster centroids candidates and thus determine a near optimal partitioning of the data at hand set. The clustering algorithm based on the PSO was introduced by Omran and al. [25]. [25, 26] Results show that the PSO-based method carries out the k-means, the FCM and a few other algorithms of classification on the State of the art. There are also other algorithms of clustering such as algorithms of clustering based on grid and density."}, {"heading": "II. THE REPRESENTATION OF DATA", "text": "The vector space of information search system,\nlaunched by Gerard Salton [27], [28], represents the documents as vectors in a vector space. The set includes a mxn Word document and a matrix document (A) , in which each column represents a document, and each A (i, j) entry represents the weighted frequency of the term i in document j. A major advantage of this representation is that the algebraic structure vector space can be exploited [29]. To achieve greater efficiency in the handling of data, it is often necessary to reduce the dimension especially when the data set is huge. The classic representation of a document text search for information is the representation in words bag (bag is a set where the repetitions are allowed), also known as the model vector (Vector Space), because a bag can be represented as a vector recording the number of occurrences of each word in the dictionary in the document at hand. In the vector model, a document is represented by a vertical vector indexed by all the elements of the dictionary (nth element of the vector is the ith term frequency in document TFi). A body is represented by a matrix D, whose columns are indexed by the documents and whose lines are indexed by terms, D = (d1,..., dn). All of the terms of the collection have the same importance to determine the similarity (concept which we will later examine in detail) between the documents; we introduce the weight of the words. The weight of the term corresponds to the importance of the term in the corpus, and each element of the document vector is multiplied by the respective weight of the term. The most widely used weighting is called TF - IDF weighting and is used in our study [30]. IDF weight for term i of the dictionary is defined as follows: Wi = log (N / ni) Where, Ni is the number of documents in the corpus contains the word i.\nVector TF - DF of a document is a vector with the\nelements: (Tf-Idf) i = TFi x log (N / ni). Bag of words representation excludes any form of grammatical analysis and any notion of distance between the words. Other representation, which has several advantages (essentially, this method processes the text regardless of the language\nused), is based on the \"n-grams (one\"n-gram is a sequence of n consecutive characters\").\"\nA document D is converted to a vector V in the\nfollowing manner:\nThe idea is to encode each word of the bag by a\nscalar (number) called tf-idf to give a mathematical aspect to text documents. Where: \u2022 tf(i,j) is the term frequency: the frequency of term ti in document dj \u2022 idf(i) is the inverse document frequency: the logarithm of the ratio between the number N of documents in the corpus and Ni the number of documents containing the term ti.\nA document corpus di after vectorization is:\ndi = (x1, x2, ... ...., xm) where m is the number of word\nof i th\nbag of word and xj is the tf-idf.\nA. Dimension reduction\nSeveral dimension reduction methods are described\nin the literature, but the methods of interest are those relating to the textual data is unstructured data used in our study. For a body of very large document, the treatment of the vector space representing such volume of data intends to apply a computation time and a very large memory space and may even prevent the use of classification algorithms. By definition, a text document is a set of words. Use these words for a task of classification for example could negatively influence on the accuracy of the classification. Indeed, and regardless of the language used several words are empty of meaning and therefore their use is unnecessary to emphasize the semantics of a text. In addition to these words of meaning, if a word appears in several documents of a corpus then it may not affect the membership of a document nor the document no-membership to a certain class, we then say that the power of the word discrimination is low. This dimension of vocabularies reduction techniques are born and are divided into two families: The selection of attributes (\u00abfeature selection\u00bb) and retrieving attributes (\"feature extraction\").\nThe principle of selection of attributes to reduce the\ndimension is very simple in its conceptual point of view and is to retain the attributes (or words) found to be relevant to the task of classification according to an evaluation function. The words that do not meet the assessment criteria are eliminated. These methods include the deletion of empty words, radical research (Stemming), frequency, information gain, the statistics of the \u03c72 and mutual information. The phenomenon of attribute extraction is to create a set of attributes that maximizes the classification process from the original attributes. We have techniques for extracting attributes, grouping of terms (\"term clustering\") and latent semantic indexing techniques. For our testing, we used the \u03c72 statistics and of gain of information because and from literature this two dimension reduction techniques give best results over the others. The information gain\nThis measure reflects mathematically by:\nWhere\nPr (x) represents the proportion of documents having the\ncharacteristic x.\nThis means that a document is part of the category\nabove\nt means that a document has the term t\n\u20b8 means that a document does not have the term t\nm is the number of class or classes\nThe \u03c72 statistics\nThe principle of this reduction technique is as follows: Given the matrix Nij occurrences of i in the j text\nwords.\n\u2022 Calculate frequencies corresponding IFJ by fij = Nij /\nN\n\u2022 Calculate (ij) contribution to the the \u03c72 statistic:\n\u2022 Sort the table of \u03c72 in descending order \u2022 Finally, determine the list of the k first words for each\ntext for standardization (heuristic choice)\nthe relationship between two data points [31]. More two data points are similar over the similarity coefficient is large. Is x = (x1, x2,..., xd) and y = (y1, y2,..., yd) two points of data in d dimensions. Then, the coefficient of similarity between x and there will be a certain function of their attribute values, namely s(x,_y) = s(x1,_x2,...,_xd,_y1,_y2,...,_yd).\nThe similarity is generally symmetric, i.e. s (x, y) = s\n(y, x).\nA proximity matrix is a matrix that contains the\nindices of pairs of proximity of a set of data. Usually, proximity matrices are symmetric. In what follows, a proximity index refers to similarity or dissimilarity index.\nGiven a set of data D = {x1, x2,..., xn}, each object\nis described by a vector of characteristics d-dimensional, the distance d matrix is defined as follows:\nWhere dij = d (xi, xj) that represents a digital\ndistance between xi and xj data.\nThe similarity to D matrix is defined as\nWhere Sij = s (xi, xj) is the similarity between xj and\nxi data.\nThe matrix remote Mdist (D) and the similarity\nmatrix Msim (D) the D data set are two examples of a proximity matrix. If the distance function and similarity function are symmetric then two proximity matrices are symmetric.\nC.

The software is fully configurable knowing that you can choose the colour of a cluster, the palette, the dimension of the scale and the functions of navigation (horizontal rotation, vertical rotation, zoom in and zoom out) to make a good visual classification. Each text document (data) is represented by a cube. A simple click of the mouse on the small cube allows us to view the corresponding gross document or its associated vector. Somehow our 3D cellular automatons like a magic cube. Software designed to make text clustering and visualization classes. This software consists of two parts, a data representation and part classification and visualization classes. The party representation receives as input a text corpus in which each document will be converted to numeric vector for each method chosen by the user in this case the n-grams and the conceptual approach (WordNet). The other part of the software, which is the largest in our study is devoted to the clustering of the vectors already found by calculating a similarity matrix represented by several distances quoted above and visualization clusters. The classification is performed by 3D cellular automata. These automata are visualized by a visualization system\ndesigned in JAVA 3D which offers very high performance navigation such as zooming in, zooming, rotation, horizontal and vertical rotation. Regarding the classification, two strategies constitution of clusters were developed in this case a constitution similar standard where documents are stored in neighboring cells (Von Neumann or Moore) and a linear formation where similar document agreed with next to the last document linearly. The figures below represent visualizations and classification results after navigation and an optimal Visual search for the different parameters of classification such as similarity threshold, the distance of similarity. Among other best classification results obtained in the tables above have been the work of optimization software also designed the study. Figures 3.4 and 5 respectively show the results of classification by cellular automata 3D cosine distance, Euclidean and Chebyshev. These figures show the best results in terms of validation tools (Entropy and F-measure) for different distances. After browsing the visualization platform based on cellular automata, we took the best plans. These jacks are made by the operations of rotation and zoom. Figures 7 and 8 show plans visualization of classes using the strategy of building linear clusters."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES", "text": "In this paper a 3D cellular automaton is proposed as a solution to the problem of unsupervised classification (clustering) of textual and spatial problems in classes in 2D cellular automata. The transition function used in our cellular automata evolved to form the group (cluster) similar to a certain threshold fields. The experimental results are positive and confirm the idea of increasing the dimension of the automat to navigate and make good reading classes in the visual design. The analysis and validation of classification results were based on evaluation criteria based on the notion of recall and precision are the f-measure and entropy. Given the results, our approach based on a biomimetic approach (3D cellular automaton) can help solve one of the problems of textual data mining and visualization. In perspective we will try to explore other methods biomimetic, because nature has not yet revealed all the secrets to solve combinatorial problems still existing in the field of data mining."}], "references": [{"title": "A concept space approach to addressing the vocabulary problem in scientific information retrieval: An experiment on the worm community system", "author": ["H.
