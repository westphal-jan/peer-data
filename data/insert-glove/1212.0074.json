Its closest better-known relative is Persian. Kurdish is spoken in Kurdistan, a large geographical area spanning the intersections of Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria. It is one of the two official languages in Iraq and has a regional status in Iran.\nDespite having 20 to 30 millions of speakers1, Kurdish is among the lessresourced languages and there are very few tailor-made tools available for processing texts written in this language. Similarly, it has not seen much attention from the IR and NLP research communities and the existing literature can be summarized as a few attempts in building corpus and lexicon for Kurdish [2,8]. In order to provide the basic tools and techniques for processing Kurdish, we have recently launched a project at University of Kurdistan (UoK 2). This paper gives an overview of the main challenges that we need to address throughout this project.\nBefore proceeding to enumerate the challenges, we would first like to highlight a few things about the scope and methodology of the current paper. Firstly, in this work we only consider the two largest and closely-related branches of Kurdish \u2013namely Kurmanji (or Northern Kurdish) and Sorani (or Central Kurdish)\u2013 and exclude the other smaller and distant dialects. Secondly, in the interest of space, we give greater importance to the issues that are specific to Kurdish and refer to the related papers for in-depth discussion of issues that are shared between Kurdish and other languages (in particular, Persian, Arabic, and Urdu). Finally, we restrict our discussion to the bag-of-words (i.e., IR) model and do not address the structural (i.e., NLP) aspects.\n1 Numbers vary, depending on the source. 2 Project\u2019s website: http://eng.uok.ac.ir/esmaili/research/klpp/en/main.htm.\nar X\niv :1\n21 2.\n00 74\nv1 [\ncs .I\nR ]\n1 D\nec 2\n01 2"}, {"heading": "2 Challenges", "text": "We have categorized the main challenges into five groups. While the first two groups are concerned with the diversity aspect of the Kurdish language, the third and fourth highlight the processing difficulties and the last one examines the depth of resource-scarcity for Kurdish."}, {"heading": "2.1 Dialect Diversity", "text": "The first and foremost challenge in processing Kurdish texts is its dialect diversity. In this paper we focus on Kurmanji and Sorani which are the two most important Kurdish dialects in terms of number of speakers and degree of standardization [3]. Together, they account for more than 75% of native Kurdish speakers [8].\nThe features distinguishing these two dialects are mainly morphological (the phonological differences are explained in the next section). The important morphological differences are [5,3]:\n\u2013 Kurmanji is more conservative in retaining both gender (feminine:masculine) and case opposition (absolute:oblique) for nouns and pronouns. Sorani has largely abandoned this system and uses the pronominal suffixes to take over the functions of the cases3.\n\u2013 in the past-tense transitive verbs, Kurmanji has the full ergative alignment but Sorani, having lost the oblique pronouns, resorts to pronominal enclitics.\n\u2013 in Sorani, passive and causative can be created exclusively via verb morphology, in Kurmanji they can also be formed with the verbs hatin (to come) and dan (to give) respectively.\n\u2013 the definite suffix -eke appears only in Sorani"}, {"heading": "2.2 Script Diversity", "text": "Due to geopolitical reasons, each of the two aforementioned dialects has been using its own writing system. In fact, Kurdish is considered a bi-standard language [2], with Kurmanji written in Latin-based letters and Sorani written in Arabic-based letters. Both of these systems are almost totally phonetic [2]. As noted before, Sorani and Kurmanji are not morphologically identical and since these systems reflect the phonology of their corresponding dialects, there is no bijective mapping between them. In Figure 1 we have included three tables to demonstrate the non-trivial mappings between these two writing systems. It should be noted that the table in c) contains approximate equivalences. These mappings are in line with the list proposed in [4]."}, {"heading": "2.3 Normalization", "text": "The Unicode assignments of the Arabic-based Kurdish alphabet has two potential sources of ambiguity which should be dealt with carefully:\n3 Although there is evidence of gender distinctions weakening in some varieties of Kurmanji [3].\n\u2013 for some letters such as ye and ka there are more than one Unicode [7]. During the normalization phase, the occurrences of these multi-code letters should be unified. \u2013 as in Urdu, the isolated and final forms of the Arabic letter ha constitute one letter (pronounced e), whereas the initial and medial forms of the same Arabic letter constitute another letter (pronounced h), for which a different Unicode encoding is available [8,2]. In many electronic texts, these letters are written using only the ha, differentiated by using the zero-width non-joiner character that prevents a character from being joined to its follower. This distinction must be taken into account in the normalization phase."}, {"heading": "2.4 Segmentation and Tokenization", "text": "Segmentation refers to the process of recognizing boundaries of text constituents, including sentences, phrases and words. Compared to Persian and Arabic, this process is relatively easier in Kurdish, mainly because short vowels are explicitly represented in the Kurdish writing systems.\nIn fact, as discussed in [1], the absence of short vowels contributes most significantly to ambiguity in Arabic language, causing difficulty in homograph resolution, word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech detection. In Persian, its negative consequence is more visible in detecting the Izafe constructs [7] 4.\nDespite incorporating short vowels, the Arabic-based Kurdish alphabet still suffers from two problems which are inherited from the Arabic writing system:\n\u2013 Arabic alphabet does not have capitalization and therefore it is more difficult to recognize sentence boundaries as well as recognizing Named Entities. \u2013 Space is not a deterministic delimiter and boundary sign [7]. It may appear within a word or between words, or may be absent between some sequential words. There are some proposals on how to tackle this issue in Persian [6] and Urdu [9].\n4 Izafe is an unstressed vocal -e or -i added between prepositions, nouns and adjectives in a phrase. It approximately corresponds to the English preposition of. This construct is frequently used in both Persian and Kurdish languages."}, {"heading": "2.5 Lack of Language Resources", "text": "Kurdish is a resource-scarce language for which the only linguistic resource available on the Web is raw text [8].\nMore concretely, in spite the few attempts in building corpus [2] and lexicon [8], Kurdish still does not have any large-scale and reliable general/domainspecific corpus. Furthermore, no test collection \u2013which is essential in evaluation of Information Retrieval systems\u2013 or stemming algorithm has been developed for Kurdish so far.\nLastly, although Kurdish is well served with dictionaries [3], it still lacks a WordNet-like semantic lexicon."}, {"heading": "3 Conclusions", "text": "Kurdish text processing poses a range of challenges. The most important one is the dialect/script diversity which has resulted in a bi-standard situation. As the examples in [2] show, the \u201csame\u201d word, when going from Kurmanji to Sorani, may at the same time go through several levels of change: writing systems, phonology, morphology, and sometimes semantics. This clearly shows that the mapping between this two dialects are more than transliteration, though less complicated than translation. Any text processing system designed for Kurdish language should develop and exploit a mapping between these two standards.\nOn the technical side, providing the required processing techniques \u2013through leveraging the existing techniques or designing new ones if needed\u2013 offers many avenues for future work. However, as a critical prerequisite to most of these tasks, a core set of language resources must be available first. At UoK, we have taken the first step and are currently working on building a large standard test collection for Kurdish language."}], "references": [{"title": "Arabic Natural Language Processing: Challenges and Solutions", "author": ["A.
