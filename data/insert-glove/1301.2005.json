In description logics, an ontology is expressed as a knowledge base (KB). Inconsistency is not rare in ontology applications and may be caused by several reasons, such as errors in modeling, migration from other formalisms, ontology merging, and ontology evolution. Therefore, handling inconsistency is always considered an important problem in DL and ontology management communities. However, DL-Lite reasoning mechanism based on classical DL semantics faces problem when inconsistency occurs, which is referred to as the triviality problem. That is, any conclusions, that are possibly irrelevant or even contradicting, will be entailed from an inconsistent DL-Lite ontology under the classical semantics.\nIn many practical ontology applications, there is a strong need for inferring (only) useful information from inconsistent ontologies. For instance, consider a simple DLLite KB K = (T ,A) where T = {Penguin \u2291 Bird, Swallow \u2291 Bird,Bird \u2291 Fly} and A = {Penguin(tweety),\u00acFly(tweety), Swallow(fred)}. Under the classical semantics for DLs, anything can be inferred from K. Intuitively, one might\nwish to still infer Brid(fred) and Fly(fred), while they are useless to derive both Fly(tweety) and \u00acFly(tweety) from K.\nThere exist several proposals for reasoning with inconsistent DL-Lite KBs in the literature. These approaches usually fall into one of two fundamentally different streams. The first one is based on the assumption that inconsistencies are caused by erroneous data and thus, they should be removed in order to obtain a consistent KB ([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]). In most approaches in this stream, the task of repairing inconsistent ontologies is actually reduced to finding a maximum consistent subset of the original KB. A shortcoming of these approaches is the so-called multi-extension problem. That is, in many cases, an inconsistent KB may have several different sub-KBs that are maximum consistent. The other stream, based on the idea of living with inconsistency, is to introduce a form of paraconsistent reasoning or inconsistency-tolerant reasoning by employing non-standard reasoning methods (e.g., non-standard inference and non-classical semantics). [7, 8, 9, 10] introduce some strategies to select consistent subsets from an inconsistent KB as substitutes of the original KB in reasoning. [11] present the Belnap\u2019s four-valued semantics of DLs where two additional logical values besides \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d are introduced to indicate contradictory conclusions. [12, 13] present the Hunter\u2019s quasi-classical semantics of DLs whose strong semantics strengthens the inference power of four-valued semantics. However, the reasoning capability of such paraconsistent methods is not strong enough for many practical applications. For instance, a conclusion \u03c6, that can inferred from a consistent KB K under the classical semantics, may become not derivable under their paraconsistent semantics. We argue that approaches in these two streams are mostly coarse-grained in the sense that they fail to fully utilize semantic information in the given inconsistent KB. For instance, when two interpretations make a concept unsatisfiable, one interpretation may be more reasonable than the other. But existing approaches to paraconsistent semantics in DLs do not take this into account usually.\nRecently a distance-based semantics presented by [14] has been proposed to deal with inconsistent KBs in propositional logic. However, it is not straightforward to generalize this approach to DLs because a DL KB can have infinite number of models and a model can also be infinite. Additionally, it is also a challenge in adopting distancebased semantics for DL complex constructors.\nTo overcome these difficulties, in this paper we first use the notion of features [15] and introduce a distance-based semantics for paraconsistent reasoning with DL-Lite. Feature in DL-Lite are Herbrand interpretations extended with limited structure, which provide a novel semantic characterization for DLs. In addition, features also generalize the notion of types for TBoxes [16] to general KBs. Each KB in DL-Lite has a finite number of features and each feature is finite. This makes it possible to cast Arieli\u2019s distance-based semantics to DL-Lite.\nThe main innovations and contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. We introduce distances on types of DL-LiteNbool KBs, which avoids the problem of domain infiniteness and model infiniteness in defining the distance in terms of models of KBs. Based on the new distance on types, we develop a way of measuring types that are closest to a TBox and the notion of minimal model types is introduced. This notion is also extended to minimal model features for KBs. We propose a distance-based semantics for DL-LiteNbool so that useful information can still be inferred when a KB\nis inconsistent. This is accomplished by introducing a novel entailment relation (i.e. distance-based entailment) between a KB and an axiom in terms of minimal model features. Our results show that the distance-based entailment is paraconsistent, nonmonotonic, cautious as the paraconsistent based on multi-valued semantics. We also show that the distance-based entailment is not over-skeptical in the sense that for a classically consistent KB, the distance-based entailment coincides with the classical entailment, which is missing in most existing paraconsistent semantics for DLs."}, {"heading": "2 The DL-Lite Family and Features", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 The DL-Lite Family", "text": "A signature is a finite set \u03a3 = \u03a3A \u222a\u03a3R \u222a\u03a3I \u222a\u03a3N where \u03a3A is the set of atomic concepts, \u03a3R the set of atomic roles, \u03a3I the set of individual names (or, objects) and \u03a3N the set of natural numbers in \u03a3.

To characterize infinite models in a finite expression, two important notions, namely, type and feature, are respectively defined by [16] and [15] for TBoxes and general KBs in DL-Lite.\nLet \u03a3 be a signature. A \u03a3-type (or simply a type) is a set of basic concepts over \u03a3, s.t., \u22a4 \u2208 \u03c4 , and for any m,n \u2208 \u03a3N with m < n, R \u2208 \u03a3R \u222a {P\u2212 | P \u2208 \u03a3R}, \u2265 nR \u2208 \u03c4 implies \u2265 mR \u2208 \u03c4 .

Thus T\u03a3(C) = {\u03c411, \u03c412, \u03c413, \u03c414, \u03c421, \u03c422, \u03c423, \u03c424, \u03c431, \u03c432, \u03c433, \u03c434}, where\n\u03c411 = {A,B, \u2203P,\u2203P\u2212, D} \u03c412 = {A,B, \u2203P,\u00ac\u2203P\u2212,D} \u03c413 = {A,B, \u2203P,\u2203P\u2212,\u00acD} \u03c414 = {A,B, \u2203P,\u00ac\u2203P\u2212,\u00acD} \u03c421 = {A,\u00acB, \u2203P,\u2203P\u2212, D} \u03c422 = {A,\u00acB, \u2203P,\u00ac\u2203P\u2212,D} \u03c423 = {A,\u00acB, \u2203P,\u2203P\u2212,\u00acD} \u03c424 = {A,\u00acB, \u2203P,\u00ac\u2203P\u2212,\u00acD} \u03c431 = {A,B,\u00ac\u2203P,\u2203P\u2212, D} \u03c432 = {A,B,\u00ac\u2203P,\u00ac\u2203P\u2212,D} \u03c433 = {A,B,\u00ac\u2203P,\u2203P\u2212,\u00acD} \u03c434 = {A,B,\u00ac\u2203P,\u00ac\u2203P\u2212,\u00acD}\nNote that types coincide with propositional models while T\u03a3(C) coincides with the set of models of concept C. A type \u03c4 satisfies a basic concept B if B \u2208 \u03c4 , \u03c4 satisfies \u00acC if \u03c4 does not satisfy C, and \u03c4 satisfiesC1\u2293C2 if \u03c4 satisfies bothC1 andC2. T\u03a3(C) denotes a collection of all \u03a3-types of C. In this way, each general concept C over \u03a3 corresponds to a set T\u03a3(C) of all \u03a3-types satisfying C. \u03c4 satisfies a concept inclusion C \u2291 D if \u03c4 \u2208 T\u03a3(\u00acC \u2294 D). And \u03c4 is a model type a TBox T iff it satisfies each inclusion in T .\nModel type sets and model type groups are analogously defined. If \u039e is a model type set of a TBox T then \u2203P \u2208 \u222a\u039e iff \u2203P\u2212 \u2208 \u222a\u039e. This property is called role coherence which can be used to check whether a type set is the model type set of some TBox. \u03a0\u03a3(T ) denotes the model type group {T\u03a3(\u00acC1 \u2294D1), . . . , T\u03a3(\u00acCn \u2294Dn)} of T where T = {C1 \u2291 D1, . . . , Cn \u2291 Dn} is a TBox over \u03a3. It appears that \u2229\u03a0\u03a3(T ) is the collection of model \u03a3-types of T .\nA \u03a3-Herbrand set (or simply Herbrand set) H is a finite set of member assertions satisfying:\n\u2022 for each a \u2208 \u03a3I , if B1(a), . . . , Bk(a), where {B1, . . . , Bk} \u2286 \u03a3B are all the concept assertions about a in H, then the set {B1, . . . , Bk} is a \u03a3-type;\n\u2022 for each P \u2208 \u03a3R, if P (a, bi)(1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) are all the role assertions about a in H, then for any m \u2208 \u03a3N with m \u2264 n, (\u2265 mP )(a) is in H;\n\u2022 for each P \u2208 \u03a3R, if P (bi, a)(1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) are all the role assertions in H, then for any m \u2208 \u03a3N with m \u2264 n, (\u2265 mP\u2212)(a) is in H.\nNote that Herbrand sets are different from ABoxes by adopting a close world assumption (CWA). For instance, assertion B(a) 6\u2208 H means that \u00acB(a) holds in H and P (a, b) 6\u2208 H means that there does no relationship w.r.t. P from individual a to individual b.\nWe simply write \u03c4(a) = {B1(a), . . . , Bk(a)} where \u03c4 = {B1, . . . , Bk}. Moreover, given a set of types \u039e = {\u03c41, . . . , \u03c4m}, \u039e(a) denotes {\u03c41(a), . . . , \u03c4m(a)} without confusion. In this case, we say \u03c4(a) is in H if {B1(a), . . . , Bk(a)} \u2286 H. A Herbrand set H satisfies a concept assertion C(a) (a role assertion P (a, b) or P\u2212(b, a)) if \u03c4(a) is in H and \u03c4 \u2208 T\u03a3(C) (P (a, b) \u2208 H or P\u2212(b, a) \u2208 H). A Herbrand set H satisfies an ABox A if H satisfies all assertions in A.\nA \u03a3-feature (or simply a feature) F is a pair \u3008\u039e,H\u3009, where \u039e is a non-empty set of \u03a3-types and H a \u03a3-Herbrand set, if F satisfies:\n\u2022 for each P \u2208 \u03a3R, \u2203P \u2208 \u22c3 \u039e iff \u2203P\u2212 \u2208 \u22c3 \u039e (i.e., \u039e holds role coherence);\n\u2022 for each a \u2208 \u03a3I and \u03c4(a) in H, s.t., \u03c4 is a \u03a3-type, \u03c4 \u2208 \u039e.\nA feature F satisfies an inclusion C1 \u2291 C2 over \u03a3, if \u039e \u2286 T\u03a3(\u00acC1 \u2294 C2); F satisfies a concept assertion C(a) over \u03a3, if \u03c4(a) \u2208 H and \u03c4 \u2208 T\u03a3(C); and F satisfies a role assertion P (a, b) (resp., P\u2212(b, a)) over \u03a3, if P (a, b) \u2208 H. A feature F is a model feature of KB K if F satisfies each inclusion and each assertion in K. ModF (K) denotes the set of all model features of K. It easily concludes that K is consistent iff ModF (K) 6= \u2205. Given two KBs K1 and K2, let \u03a3 = Sig(K1 \u222a K2), K1 F-entails K2 if ModF (K1) \u2286 ModF (K2), written by K |=F K2; and K1 is F-equivalent K2 if ModF (K1) =ModF (K2), written by K \u2261F K2.\nExample 2 Consider a KB K = (T ,A), where T = {A \u2291 \u2203P, B \u2291 \u2203P, \u2203P\u2212 \u2291 B, A \u2293 B \u2291 \u22a5, \u2265 2 P\u2212 \u2291 \u22a5} and A = {A(a), P (a, b) }. It is shown in [17] that K is a KB having no finite model. An infinite model I of K is defined as follows: \u2206I = {da, db, d1, d2, d3 . . .}, aI = da and bI = db; the concept A is interpreted as a singleton {da} and B as {db, d1, d2, d3 . . .}; and role P is interpreted as {(da, db), (db, d1), (d1, d2), . . . , (di, di+1), . . .}. Let \u03a3K = {A,B, P, 1, 2, a, b}. The (finite) model feature of K that corresponds to I is F = \u3008\u039e,H\u3009 where the Herbrand set H = { \u03c41(a), \u03c42(b), P (a, b) } and \u039e = {\u03c41, \u03c42} with \u03c41 = {A,\u00acB, \u2203P,\u00ac\u2203P\u2212} and \u03c42 = {\u00acA,B, \u2203P, \u2203P\u2212}. Moreover, K |=F B(b) and K |=F \u2203P\u2212(b) since \u03c42(b) \u2208 H. T |=F A \u2291 \u2203P since {\u03c41, \u03c42} \u2286 T\u03a3(\u00acA \u2294 \u2203P ) where T\u03a3(\u00acA \u2294 \u2203P ) is a\nset of types as follows:\n{\u00acA,B, \u2203P, \u2203P\u2212}, {A,B, \u2203P, \u2203P\u2212}, {\u00acA,B, \u2203P,\u00ac\u2203P\u2212}, {\u00acA,B,\u00ac\u2203P, \u2203P\u2212}, {A,B, \u2203P,\u00ac\u2203P\u2212}, {A,\u00acB, \u2203P, \u2203P\u2212}, {\u00acA,B,\u00ac\u2203P,\u00ac\u2203P\u2212}, {A,\u00acB, \u2203P,\u00ac\u2203P\u2212}, {\u00acA,\u00acB,\u00ac\u2203P, \u2203P\u2212}, {\u00acA,\u00acB, \u2203P, \u2203P\u2212}, {\u00acA,\u00acB, \u2203P,\u00ac\u2203P\u2212}, {\u00acA,\u00acB,\u00ac\u2203P,\u00ac\u2203P\u2212}.\nIt would be conclude that model features can capture the semantic properties of KBs shown by following lemmas.\nLemma 1 ([15]) Let K be a KB and \u03a3 = Sig(K). Then (1) K is consistent iff K has a model feature; (2) for any inclusion or assertion \u03c6 over \u03a3, we have K |= \u03c6 iff K |=F \u03c6.\nFrom Lemma 1, the first item shows that all inconsistent KBs have no model features and the second item shows that querying entailment based on models can be reduced to querying entailment based on model features.\nLemma 2 ([15]) Let K1,K2 be two KBs and \u03a3 = Sig(K1 \u222aK2). Then (1) K1 |= K2 iff K1 |=F K2; (2) K1 \u2261 K2 iff K1 \u2261F K2.\nIntuitively, F-entailment relation is equal to classical entailment relation. In the remainder of this paper, we directly use |= to express F-entailment relation (|=F )."}, {"heading": "3 Distance-based Semantics for Knowledge Bases", "text": "This section define minimal model features of KBs. Compared with inconsistency of TBoxes, inconsistency occurring in KBs is complicated since it contains two extra cases: inconsistency of ABoxes and inconsistency between TBoxes and ABoxes. In more detail, these inconsistencies occur in among concept assertions, between concept assertions and role assertions, between assertions and inclusions, even between a single inclusion and a single assertion. For instance,\nExample 3 Let K = ({\u2203P\u2212 \u2291 \u22a5}, {\u2203P (a)}) be a KB (see [15]) and \u03a3 = {P, a, 1}. It concludes that K is inconsistent and thus has no model feature, i.e., ModF (K) = \u2205.\nTo deal with those various inconsistencies in a unified way, we adopt the technique of computing minimal model types to construct minimal model features instead of directly introducing distance over features. We argue that this adoption can not only uniformly deal with all inconsistencies but also overcome difficulty of defining distance over pairs of features (see [15]).\nWe first introduce concept profiles to use type distance can describe how far apart features are. Let \u03a3 be a signature and A an ABox over \u03a3. Assume that NA a set of all named individuals in A. AR = {P (a, b) | P (a, b) or P\u2212(b, a) \u2208 A}. A concept profile of a in A, denoted by \u03a3C(a), defined as follows: \u03a3C(a) =\n\u22c3 D(a)\u2208A{D}\u222a\u22c3\nP (a,b1),...,P (a,bn)\u2208AR {\u2265 mP | m \u2208 \u03a3N ,m \u2264 n}\u222a \u22c3 P (b1,a),...,P (bn,a)\u2208AR {\u2265\nmP\u2212 | m \u2208 \u03a3N ,m \u2264 n}.\nIntuitively speaking, a set of concept profiles is a partition of concepts occurring in an ABox w.r.t. individuals. For instance, let \u03a3 = {C,D, P, a, b1, b2, 1, 2} and A = {C \u2293 D(a), P (a, b1), P (a, b2), D(b1)}. Thus \u03a3C(a) = {C \u2293 D, \u2203P,\u2265 2P}, \u03a3C(b1) = {D, \u2203P\u2212} and \u03a3C(b2) = {\u2203P\u2212}.\nLet K = (T ,A) be a KB. We extend the signature Sig(K) of K as Sig\u2217(K) = Sig(T ) \u222a Sig(\u03a3C(A)) where \u03a3C(A) = \u22c3 a\u2208NA\n\u03a3C(a). Indeed, Sig\u2217(K) is obtained from Sig(K) by adding all possible natural numbers occurring all concept profiles but not occurring K. In other words, Sig\u2217(K) and Sig(K) are no different except \u03a3N . In the above example, Sig(A) = {C,D, P, a, b1, b2} while Sig\u2217(A) = {C,D, P, a, b1, b2, 1, 2}.\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that \u03a3 = Sig\u2217(K) in the remain of this paper, unless otherwise stated.\nNext, we will define the notion of minimal model features.\nDefinition 1 (Minimal Model Feature) Let K = (T ,A) be a KB. Denote \u03a0\u03a3(a) = {T\u03a3(D) | D \u2208 \u03a3C(a)}. Given d and f , a df -minimal model feature of K is a feature F = \u3008\u039e,H\u3009 satisfying the following three conditions:\n\u2022 \u039e \u2286 \u039b+d,f(\u03a0\u03a3(T ), T\u03a3);\n\u2022 for each P \u2208 \u03a3R, \u2203P \u2208 \u222a\u039e iff \u2203P\u2212 \u2208 \u222a\u039e;\n\u2022 \u03c4 \u2208 \u039b+d,f(\u03a0\u03a3(a),\u039b + d,f(\u03a0\u03a3(T ), T\u03a3)) \u2229 \u039e for each a \u2208 \u03a3I and \u03c4(a) \u2208 H;\n\u2022 for anyP (a, b) \u2208 AR\u2212H, either\u2265 n+1P (a) 6\u2208 H andP (a, b1), . . . , P (a, bn) \u2208 H, or \u2265 n+ 1P\u2212(b) 6\u2208 H and P (a1, b), . . . , P (an, b) \u2208 H.\nModFd,f(K) is the set of df -minimal model features of K.\nIn the above definition, a minimal model feature is a feature F which contains two parts, namely, type set \u039e and Herbrand set H. The first condition requires that all types of \u039e be minimal; the second says that \u039e should be a model type set, i.e., it satisfies the property of role coherence; the third guarantees that each type of \u039e satisfying each concept assertion in H has the minimal distance to its corresponding concept profile, that is, if a concept assertion D(a) satisfied by H then types satisfying D are minimal w.r.t. type group \u03a0\u03a3(a) of concept profile \u03a3C(a); and the last ensures that F is consistent by those role assertions conflicting with concept assertions.\nExample 4 In Penguin KB, we abbreviate Penguin to P , Swallow to S, Bird to B, Fly to F , tweety to t and fred to r. Thus \u03a3 = {P, S,B, F, t, r}, \u03a3C(t) = {P,\u00acF} and \u03a3C(r) = {S}. Assume that d is the Hamming distance and f is the aggregation function. We have\u039b+d,f(\u03a0\u03a3(T ), T\u03a3) = {\u03c41, \u03c42, \u03c44, \u03c48, \u03c412, \u03c416}, shown in the following table.\nType d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 \u03c41 = {} 1 0 1 1 1 \u03c42 = {F} 1 1 2 1 1 \u03c44 = {B,F} 1 1 2 1 1 \u03c48 = {S,B, F} 1 1 2 0 0 \u03c412 = {P,B, F} 0 1 1 1 1 \u03c416 = {P, S,B, F} 0 1 1 0 0\nHere d1 = d(\u03c4, T\u03a3(P )), d2 = d(\u03c4, T\u03a3(\u00acF )), d3 = \u03bbd,f (\u03c4,\u03a0\u03a3(t)), d4 = d(\u03c4, T\u03a3(S)) and d5 = \u03bbd,f (\u03c4,\u03a0\u03a3(r)). From the above table, it concludes that \u039b+d,f(\u03a0\u03a3(a),\u039b + d,f(\u03a0\u03a3(T ), T\u03a3)) = {\u03c41, \u03c412, \u03c416} and \u039b + d,f(\u03a0\u03a3(r),\u039b + d,f (\u03a0\u03a3(T ), T\u03a3)) = {\u03c48, \u03c416}. Thus, ModFd,f (K) = {\u3008\u039e, \u03c4(t) \u222a \u03c4 \u2032(r)\u3009 | \u03c4 \u2208 {\u03c41, \u03c412, \u03c416}, \u03c4 \u2032 \u2208 {\u03c48, \u03c416}, {\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032} \u2286 \u039e and \u039e \u2286 {\u03c41, \u03c48, \u03c412, \u03c416}}.\nWe find that minimal model features can reach our aim.\nProposition 1 Let K be a KB. For any d and f , we have\n\u2022 ModFd,f (K) 6= \u2205;\n\u2022 ModFd,f (K) =Mod F (K), if K is consistent.\nThe intuition behind Proposition 1 is that the minimal model features of a KB are features closet to it\u2019s classical semantics. Remember that, while an inconsistent KB does not have any model feature, each KB has at least one minimal model feature. An expected result is that the second statement of Proposition 1 does not necessarily hold if K is inconsistent. For instance, in Example 3, ModFd,f(K) = {F1,F2} where F1 = \u3008{\u2203P}, {\u2203P (a)}\u3009 and F2 = \u3008{\u2203P, \u2203P\u2212}, {\u2203P (a), \u2203P\u2212(a)}\u3009 while ModF (K) = \u2205.\nNow, based on minimal model features, we are ready to define the distance-based entailment for KBs, written |=d,f , under which meaningful information can be entailed from an inconsistent KB.\nDefinition 2 (KB Distance-based Entailment) Let K be a KB and \u03c6 an axiom. Assume \u03a3 = Sig\u2217(K \u222a {\u03c6}) be a signature. Given d and f , K distance-based entails (d-entails) \u03c6, still denoted by K |=d,f \u03c6, if ModFd,f(K) \u2286Mod F ({\u03c6}).\nDistance-based entailment brings a new semantics (called distance-based semantics) for inconsistent KBs by weakening classical entailment. It is not hard to see that no contradiction can be entailed in this semantics. For instance, in Penguin KB, \u00acFly \u2293Fly(tweety) can not entailed but \u00acFly \u2294Fly(tweety) can under this semantics.\nIn the rest of this section, we exemplify that distance-based semantics is suitable for reasoning with inconsistent KBs.\nConsequences are intuitive and reasonable under the distance-based semantics. In Penguin KB,K |=dH ,fs Fly(fred) whileK 6|=dH ,fs Penguin(tweety) andK 6|=dH ,fs Fly(tweety). We further analyze those conclusions under distance-based semantics. The inconsistency of K is caused by statement about tweety. On the one hand, tweety is a penguin which can not fly, i.e., \u00acFly(tweety). On the other hand, penguin is a bird which can fly, i.e., Fly(tweety). Moreover, there exists no more argument for either Penguin(tweety) or Fly(tweety). In this sense, neither Penguin(tweety) nor Fly(tweety) can be entailed under distance-based semantics. However, the statement about fred in K contains no conflict. Thus Fly(fred) can be entailed under distance-based semantics.\nFurthermore, distance-based semantics also embodies the idea of \u201cmajority vote consideration\u201d (see [14]), that is, conclusions must hold more argument for them, for resolving contradictions so that the results are more stable. For instance,\nExample 5 Let K be a KB ({A \u2291 B}, {A(a), B(a),\u00acB(a)}). Thus \u03a3 = Sig\u2217(K) = {A,B, a} and \u03a3C(a) = {A,B,\u00acB}. Then \u039bdH ,fs(\u03a0\u03a3(T ), T\u03a3) = {{\u00acA,\u00acB}, {A,\u00acB}, {A,B}}. ModF\ndH ,fs (K) = {\u3008\u039e, \u03c4(a)\u3009 | \u039e \u2286 \u039bdH ,fs(\u03a0\u03a3(T ), T\u03a3) and\n\u03c4 \u2208 \u039e}. Therefore, K can d-entails A(a), B(a) and A \u2291 B except for \u00acB(a). Intuitively, compared with \u00acB(a), there is an extra argument {A(a), A \u2291 B} for B(a)."}, {"heading": "4 Properties of Distance-based Semantics", "text": "In general, our distance-based semantics can be taken as a framework in which many logical consequences are defined by selecting various distances and aggregation functions. In this section, we enumerate several good properties of distance-based semantics and several interesting relationships among them.\nIf K is inconsistent and there exists an axiom \u03c6 such that K 6|=p \u03c6 where |=p is an entailment relation, then we say |=p is paraconsistent. It is well known that classical entailment |= is not paraconsistent.\nProposition 2 (Paraconsistency) For any d and f , |=d,f is paraconsistent.\nTo show the paraconsistency of the distance-based entailment, consider Example 3 and we have K |=dH ,fs \u2203P\n\u2212 \u2291 \u22a5 while K 6|=dH ,fs \u2203P (a). Most existing semantics for paraconsistent reasoning in DLs are much weaker than the classical semantics in this sense that there exists a consistent KB K and an axiom \u03c6 such that K |= \u03c6 (also called consistency preservation) but \u03c6 is not entailed by K under the paraconsistent semantics. The following result shows that the distance-based semantics does not have such shortcoming.\nProposition 3 (Consistency Preservation) Let K be a KB and \u03c6 an axiom. For any d and f , if K is consistent, then K |=d,f \u03c6 iff K |= \u03c6.\nIn classical semantics, a property that K |= \u03c8 iff T |= \u03c8 for any inclusion \u03c8 is called TBox-preservation where the problem of subsumption checking is irrelevant to ABoxes. Our distance-based semantics satisfies such a property.\nProposition 4 (TBox Preservation) Let K = (T ,A) be a KB and \u03c8 an inclusion. For any d and f , K |=d,f \u03c8 iff T |=d,f \u03c8.\nThe closure w.r.t. |=d,f of an arbitrary KB is always consistent.\nProposition 5 (Closure Consistency) Let K = (T ,A) be a KB. For any d and f , let\n\u2022 Cnd,f (T ) = {\u03c8 is an inclusion | T |=d,f \u03c8};\n\u2022 CnTd,f (A) = {\u03d5 is an assertion | (T ,A) |=d,f \u03d5}.\nWe have both Cnd,f(T ) and CnTd,f (A) are consistent.\nLet \u03a3 be a signature. A distance d is \u03a3-unbiased, if for any \u03a3-concept C and any two \u03a3-types \u03c41, \u03c42 so that A \u2208 \u03c41 iff A \u2208 \u03c42 for any concept name A occurring in C then d(\u03c41, T\u03a3(C)) = d(\u03c42, T\u03a3(C)). Unbiasedness will bring a good property of relevance in reasoning.\nProposition 6 (Relevance) Let K be a KB, \u03c6 a non-tautological axiom and \u03a3 = Sig\u2217(K \u222a {\u03c6}) a signature. If d is unbiased and Sig(K) \u2229 Sig({\u03c6}) = \u2205, then K 6|=d,f \u03c6 for any f .\nAn entailment relation |=m is monotonic if K\u2032 |=m \u03c6 implies K |=m \u03c6 for any K\u2032 \u2286 K; nonmonotonic otherwise. Another characteristic property of |=d,f is its nonmonotonic nature.\nProposition 7 (Non-monotonicity) For any d and f , |=d,f is non-monotonic.\nWhile the distance-based semantics is non-monotonic in general, it possesses a kind of cautious monotonicity, which is usually referred to as splitting property.\nFor instance, let K = ({\u22a4 \u2291 A,A \u2291 \u2203P, \u2203P \u2291 \u22a5, \u2203P1 \u2291 \u2203P2}, {A(a), \u2203P1(b)}) be a KB, K can be split into K = K1 \u222a K2 where K1 = ({\u2203P1 \u2291 \u2203P2}, {\u2203P1(b)}) and K2 = ({\u22a4 \u2291 A,A \u2291 \u2203P, \u2203P \u2291 \u22a5}, {A(a)}). Then, let \u03c6 = P2(b), the problem of deciding K |=d,f \u03c6 can be reduced to checking whether K1 |=d,f \u03c6. Notice that K1 is consistent and Sig(K1) \u2229 Sig(K2) = \u2205. For some non-monotonic semantics, these two conditions are sufficient to guarantee the validity of the splitting property. However, it is not the case when K1 contains more than one axiom. For this reason, we need hereditary aggregation functions to really guarantee the validity of the splitting property (see [14]).\nWe say K is split into K\u2032 and K\u2032\u2032, denoted K = K\u2032 \u2295K\u2032\u2032, if (1) K = K\u2032 \u222a K\u2032\u2032, and (2) Sig(K\u2032) \u2229 Sig(K\u2032\u2032) = \u2205.\nAn aggregation function f is hereditary iff f({x1, . . . , xn}) < f({y1, . . . , yn}) implies for any z1, . . . , zm, f({x1, . . . , xn, z1, . . . , zm})< f({y1, . . . , yn, z1, . . . , zm}). For instance, the summation function is hereditary.\nProposition 8 (Splitting Property) Let K = K\u2032\u2295K\u2032\u2032 where K\u2032 is consistent. If K\u2032 |= \u03c6 then for any hereditary aggregation function f and d, K |=d,f \u03c6 for each axiom \u03c6 such that Sig(\u03c6) \u2229 Sig(K\u2032\u2032) = \u2205.\nOne advantage of the splitting property is that the paraconsistent reasoning in KB K can be localized into the classical reasoning in a consistent module of K, which is usually smaller than the original K. Such a property can be very useful for a highly distributed ontology system.\nA relation |\u2248 is cautious if it satisfies:\n\u2022 (cautious reflexivity) if K = K\u2032 \u2295 K\u2032\u2032 and K\u2032 is consistent, then K|\u2248\u03d5 for all \u03d5 \u2208 K\u2032;\n\u2022 (cautious monotonicity) if K|\u2248\u03d5 and K|\u2248\u03c8, then K \u222a {\u03d5}|\u2248\u03c8;\n\u2022 (cautious cut) if K|\u2248\u03d5 and K \u222a {\u03d5}|\u2248\u03c8 then K|\u2248\u03c8.\nProposition 9 (Cautious Relation) For any d and monotonic hereditary aggregation function f , |=d,f is cautious.\nProposition 10 Let K = (T ,A) be a KB, \u03c6 an axiom and \u03a3 = Sig\u2217(K \u222a {\u03c6}) a signature. For any f , if K |=dD,f \u03c6 then K |=dH ,f \u03c6.\nIn Proposition 10, the converse does not hold.\nExample 6 Let A = {A(a),\u00acA \u2293 \u2203P (a),\u00ac\u2203P (a)} be an inconsistent ABox. Thus A |=dH ,fm \u00acA \u2294 \u2203P (a) while A 6|=dD,fm \u00acA \u2294 \u2203P (a).\nIn general, different result for a KB would be brought by selecting different distance and aggregation. For instance, in Example 3, A |=\ndH ,f 1 2\nA(a) while A 6|=dH ,fs A(a).\nThe next result shows that for \u03ba-voting functions, the greater \u03ba is, the stronger the power of distance-based entailment is.\nProposition 11 (\u03ba-voting Monotonicity) Let K be a KB and \u03c6 an axiom. Assume \u03a3 = Sig\u2217(K\u222a{\u03c6}) is a signature. For any two voting indexes \u03ba1, \u03ba2 \u2208 (0, 1) and any d, if \u03ba1 \u2264 \u03ba2 then K |=d,f\u03ba1 \u03c6 implies K |=d,f\u03ba2 \u03c6."}, {"heading": "5 Related Works", "text": "In this section, we compare our scenario with existing paraconsistent approaches in DL-Lite or other DLs.\nExisting model-centered approaches for inconsistency handling are usually based on sorts of extended inconsistency tolerable semantics, such as four-valued description logics by [18] and quasi-classical description logics by [12]. Compared to them, our distance-based semantics works on classical interpretations but still can draw more useful and reasonable logical consequences. For example, under four-vaued DL-Lite, modus ponens, modus tollens and disjunctive syllogism are no longer hold. Taking the Penguin KB for example, we can not drive the intuitive conclusions that the swallow fred is a bird and can fly under the four-valued semantics (with the material inclusion interpretation [18]). Contrarily, quasi-classical DLs can satisfy basic reasoning rules mentioned above. However, they might bring too much contradictory consequences. Considering again the Penguin KB, all assertions about tweety become contradictory under the quasi-classical semantics. Moreover, these approaches do not provide a mechanism of comparing different models for a KB and are usually monotonic such that they do not hold consistency-preserving. And above all, our scenario provides a framework which is feasibly extended in a natural way to multiple-valued semantics so that multiple-valued logics can be incorporated.\nDifferent from model-based approaches, syntax-based paraconsistent approaches taking some consistent subsets as substitutes of KBs in reasoning, such as [7, 8, 9]. Similarly to our approach, those syntax-based paraconsistent semantics can satisfy several properties that do not hold in multi-valued semantics, such as non-monotonicity, consistency-preserving and splitting property. But they differ from ours in the following aspects. Firstly, they do not satisfy the closure consistency. Secondly, those syntaxbased approaches focus on local information so that they could difficultly capture the semantics of whole a KB. Finally, they might bring the multi-extension problem because of limitations of their selection mechanisms."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have presented a model-based framework to handle inconsistency in DL-Lite by introducing distances over types of features for KBs. Within this framework, we defined a kind of semantics (called distance-based semantics) which characterize a kind of cautious entailment relations that are paraconsistent, non-monotonic and hold the splitting property. A characteristic property of distance-based entailments is that they retain consistency to a large extent. Furthermore, our model-based framework gives consideration to both semantic minimal change and the rule of \u201cmajority vote consideration\u201d in syntax. In this sense, our approach is a natural combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. As a result, our scenario is a more fine-grained compared to previous approaches to paraconsistent reasoning. Though distance-based semantics presented in this paper is built on classical semantics (two-valued semantics), we can also define distance-based semantics on multi-valued semantics within our framework.\nThe definition of the distance-based entailment relation actually provides an algorithm for paraconsistent reasoning in DL-Lite for general distances. It would be useful to develop efficient algorithms and implement them in the future. In addition, [18] propose a distance-based approach to measure inconsistency of TBoxes. However, this approach might be difficult to do so because of infinity of models of DL KBs.

In this paper, we present a distance-based paraconsistent semantics based on the notion of feature in DL-Lite, which provides a novel way to rationally draw meaningful conclusions even from an inconsistent knowledge base. Finally, we investigate several important logical properties of this entailment relation based on the new semantics and show its promising advantages in non-monotonic reasoning for DL-Lite.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
