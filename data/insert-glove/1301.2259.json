The network de\u00ad composes a utility function into a number of additive factors, with the directionality of the arcs reflecting conditional dependence in the underlying (qualitative) preference ordering under a ceteris paribus interpreta\u00ad tion. The CP-semantics ensures that computing opti\u00ad mization and dominance queries is very efficient. We also demonstrate the value of this representation in de\u00ad cision making. Finally, we describe an interactive elic\u00ad itation procedure that takes advantage of the linear na\u00ad ture of the constraints on \"tradeoff weights\" imposed by a UCP-network.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
