Unlike computing priors, posteriors, and MPE (a special case of MAP), the time and space complexity of MAP is not only exponen\u00ad tial in the network treewidth, but also in a larger parameter known as the \"constrained\" treewidth. In practice, this means that com\u00ad puting MAP can be orders of magnitude more expensive than computing priors, pos\u00ad teriors or MPE. For this reason, MAP com\u00ad putations are generally avoided or approxi\u00ad mated by practitioners. We have investigated the approximation of MAP using local search. The local search method has a space complexity which is ex\u00ad ponential only in the network treewidth, as is the complexity of each step in the search process. Our experimental results show that local search provides a very good approxima\u00ad tion of MAP, while requiring a small number of search steps. Practically, this means that the average case complexity of local search is often exponential only in treewidth as op\u00ad posed to the constrained treewidth, mak\u00ad ing approximating MAP as efficient as other computations.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
