Unlike loopy belief propagation, which iterates fixed point equations, we directly descend on the Bethe free energy. The algorithm consists of two phases, first we update the pairwise probabilities, given the marginal probabili\u00ad ties at each unit, using an analytic expres\u00ad sion. Next, we update the marginal proba\u00ad bilities , by following the negative gradient of the Bethe free energy. Both steps are guar\u00ad anteed to decrease the Bethe free energy, and since it is lower bounded, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum. We also show that the Bethe free energy is equal to the TAP free energy up to second order in the weights. In experiments we con\u00ad firm that when belief propagation converges it usually finds identical solutions as our be\u00ad lief optimization method. The stable nature of belief optimization makes it ideally suited for learning graphical models from data.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
