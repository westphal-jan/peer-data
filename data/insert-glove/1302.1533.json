We intro\u00ad duce a property of state space partitions which we call f-homogeneity. Intuitively, an f-homogeneous partition groups together states that behave approximately the same under all or some subset of policies. Borrow\u00ad ing from recent work on model minimization in computer-aided software verification, we present an algorithm that takes a factored representation of an MDP and an 0 \ufffd f \ufffd I and computes a factored f-homogeneous par\u00ad tition of the state space. This partition defines a family of related MOPs-those MOP's with state space equal to the blocks of the partition, and transition probabilities \"appro:X:imately\" like those of any (original MDP) state in the source block. To formally study such families of MDPs, we introduce the new notion of a \"bounded parameter MDP\" (BMDP), which is a fam\u00ad ily of (traditional) MOPs defined by speci\u00ad fying upper and lower bounds on the transi\u00ad tion probabilities and rewards. We describe algorithms that operate on BMDPs to find policies that are approximately optimal with respect to the original MDP. In combination, our method for reducing a large implicit MDP to a possibly much smaller BMDP using an f-homogeneous par\u00ad tition, and our methods for selecting actions in BMDP's constitute a new approach for an\u00ad alyzing large implicit MOP's. Among its ad\u00ad vantages, this new approach provides insight into existing algorithms to solving implicit MDPs, provides useful connections to work in automata theory and model minimization, and suggests methods, which involve vary\u00ad ing f, to trade time and space (specifically in terms of the size of the corresponding state space) for solution quality.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
