An influence diagram specifies a certain or\u00ad der of observations and decisions through its structure. This order is reflected in the corre\u00ad sponding junction trees by the order in which the nodes are marginalized. This order of marginalization can be changed by table ex\u00ad pansion and use of control structures, and this facilitates for calculating the expected value of information for different information scenarios within the same junction tree. In effect, a strong junction tree with expanded tables may be used for calculating the value of information between several scenarios with different observation-decision order. We compare our method to other methods for calculating the value of information in in\u00ad fluence diagrams.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
