The idea is that subtracting the current image from a time\u00ad averaged background image will leave only non\u00ad stationary objects. It is, however, a crude ap\u00ad proximation to the task of classifying each pixel of the current image; it fails with slow-moving objects and does not distinguish shadows from moving objects. The basic idea of this paper is that we can classify each pixel using a model of how that pixel looks when it is part of different classes. We learn a mixture-of-Gaussians classi\u00ad fication model for each pixel using an unsuper\u00ad vised technique-an efficient, incremental ver\u00ad sion of EM. Unlike the standard image-averaging approach, this automatically updates the mixture component for each class according to likelihood of membership; hence slow-moving objects are handled perfectly. Our approach also identifies and eliminates shadows much more effectively than other techniques such as thresholding.
