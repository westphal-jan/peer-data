That is, the mes\u00ad sage to be sent from a clique can be com\u00ad puted via a factorization of the clique poten\u00ad tial in the form of a junction tree. In this pa\u00ad per we show that by exploiting such nested junction trees in the computation of messages both space and time costs of the conventional propagation methods may be reduced. The paper presents a structured way of exploit\u00ad ing the nested junction trees technique to achieve such reductions.
