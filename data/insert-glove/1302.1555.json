We also provide a simple but efficient procedure for nonuniform partition. To represent a nonuni\u00ad form discretization in the computer memory, we introduce a new data structure, which we call a Bi\u00ad nary Split Partition (BSP) tree. We show that BSP trees can be an exponential factor smaller than the data structures in the standard uniform discretiza\u00ad tion in multiple dimensions and show how the BSP trees can be used in the standard join tree algo\u00ad rithm. We show that the accuracy of the inference process can be significantly improved by adjusting discretization with evidence.
