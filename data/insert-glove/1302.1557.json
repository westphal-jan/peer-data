In more complex domains, problem-specific models must be constructed from a knowledge base encoding probabilistic relationships in the domain. Most work in knowledge-based model construction takes the rule as the basic unit of knowledge. We present a knowledge representation framework that permits the knowledge base designer to specify knowledge in larger semantically meaningful units which we call network fragments. Our framework provides for representation of asymmetric independence and canonical intercausal interaction. We discuss the combination of network fragments to form problem-specific models to reason about particular problem instances. The framework is illustrated using examples from the domain of military situation awareness.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
