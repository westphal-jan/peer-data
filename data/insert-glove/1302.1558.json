Relevance-based decomposition ap\u00ad proaches belief updating in large networks by focusing on their parts and decompos\u00ad ing them into partially overlapping subnet\u00ad works. This makes reasoning in some in\u00ad tractable networks possible and, in addition, often results in significant speedup, as the to\u00ad tal time taken to update all subnetworks is in practice often considerably less than the time taken to update the network as a whole.
