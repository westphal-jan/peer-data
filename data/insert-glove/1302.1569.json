Default logic [Reiter, 1980] is one of the most well known formalisms of non-monotonic reasoning. Al though default logic has many attractive features, it also encounters some conceptual difficulties in repre senting common sense reasoning tasks. In some cases, the most \"intuitive\" and direct formulation of a sce nario can lead to unexpected interactions and unin tended extensions, and we need to revise the formu lation to some less intuitive form in order to arrive at the intended results. A number of variants of de fault logic have been proposed to circumvent some of these difficulties encountered by Reiter's default logic, but they too in some cases produce counter-\nintuitive results [Lukaszewicz, 1988; Brewka, 1991; Gelfand et al., 1991; Delgrande et al., 1994; Mikitiuk and Truszczynski, 1995].\nMost of these approaches downplay an important as pect: that each reasoning step is not done in isola tion. One implicit assumption of default logic and its variants seems to be that default reasoning can be characterized using simple rules that work equally well across all typical situations. A brute force method to deal with the unintuitive use of a default rule in some particular situation is to add a condition to the justi fication list to explicitly block the rule when that sit uation arises. This was first suggested in [Reiter and Criscuolo, 1981], where the use of semi-normal default rules instead of normal default rules was introduced.\nWe argue that we should not hope to write down de fault rules that are both simple and intuitive across many situations. A rule that appears to be intuitive and straightforward at first sight may have side effects and unintended applications in some circumstances. We need to take into account the context that is con tinuously evolving when we reason non-monotonically. After we have accepted a default conclusion, we take that conclusion as true, and it becomes part of the con text with respect to which we evaluate the remaining default rules. Thus the context consists of the state ments we take as true at the moment: the initial set of given \"facts\" F, plus the consequents of the default rules that have been applied up to this point.\nAnother way to handle the problem is to appeal to some external source of information not communicated in the default rules, such as using inheritance or prior ity hierarchies to prefer more specific or higher priority default rules [Touretzky, 1984; Harty et al., 1987], and the utilization of probability theory for determining ac ceptable default rules [Pearl, 1989; Neufeld et al., 1990; Bacchus et al., 1993]. Our approach of sequential thresholding also makes use of probability, in a way closer to the spirit of non-monotonic reasoning and in particular default logic.\n438 Teng\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec tion 2 outlines the distinction between non-monotonic reasoning and Bayesian based probabilistic reasoning. Section 3 gives a brief summary of default logic, and discusses some of its conceptual difficulties and how they are related to the evolving context that is not ac cessible to the default logic mechanism. Section 4 in troduces a probabilistic non-monotonic reasoning for malism we call sequential thresholding, and Section 5 provides a semantic account of non-monotonic reason ing in general and default logic and sequential thresh olding in particular. Section 6 discusses how the two mechanisms can benefit from each other, and Section 7 concludes the discussion.\n2 NON-MONOTONIC DEFAULTS, MONOTONIC PROBABILITIES\nAs pointed out in [Kyburg, 1996], there is a distinc tion between uncertain inferences and uncertain con clusions. In the former, the inference mechanism is uncertain, but the conclusions thus obtained are re garded as perfectly certain. There may be multiple extensions, each of which representing a possible sce nario, but within each extension there is no question about the \"truth\" of the inferred conclusions. We may need to retract such conclusions in the face of new in formation, hence the non-monotonicity. Default logic and many other logical formalisms such as autoepis temic logic [Moore, 1985] and circumscription [Mc Carthy, 1980] fall into this category.\nOn the other hand, most of the probabilistic com munity falls into the latter category. The rules of probability employed, such as Bayes' rule, are per fectly deductive, and it is the conclusions, of the form Pr(x) = r, which convey the uncertainty. New in formation does not invalidate the previous probability calculations, since the original probability values are conditioned on a string of events without the new piece of information, while with the update, we are condi tioning on an additional piece of information. The two probability distributions are distinct as they are conditioned on distinct sets of events. Therefore such probability mechanisms are not non-monotonic.\nAn exception to this monotonic probabilistic trend is Kyburg's probabilistic acceptance [Kyburg, 1961], which advocates accepting the conclusions fully when their probabilities are deemed high enough. The work described in this paper is along the same lines. We focus on default logic as a concrete example of non monotonic reasoning formalisms, and discuss how a link between default logic and probability can be ben eficial to both. Below let us briefly summarize the preliminary terminology of default logic.\n3 DEFAULT LOGIC [Reiter, 1980]\nLet \u00a3 be a standard propositional language, and P be the finite set of propositional constants in \u00a3. We denote the provability operator by f-, and for any S s;; \u00a3,we have Th(S):::::: {\u00a2:Sf-\u00a2}.\nDefinition 1 A default rule is an expression O<:M\u00a71\ufffd .. ,M/3n, where n:,{31, . . . ,(3n, ryE C. We call n: the prerequisite, {31, . .. , /3n the justifications, and 1 the consequent of the default rule. A default rule is normal if it is of the form a::\ufffd1, and semi-normal if it is of the form a::\ufffdf\"7. A default theory \ufffd is an ordered pair (D, F), where D is a set of default rules and F (facts) s;; \u00a3.\nLoosely speaking, a default rule a::Mi3t\ufffd\u00b7 ,Mf3, repre sents that if n: is provable, and -,j31, ... , '/3n is each not provable, then we by default assert that 7 is true. For a default theory \ufffd = (D, F), the known facts con stitute F, and a theory extended from F by applying the default rules in D is known as an extension of \ufffd. defined as follows.\nDefinition 2 Let \ufffd = (D, F) be a default theory over C, and E s;; C. f(E) is the smallest set satis fying the following three properties. [ 1 j F s;; r( E), {2] f(E) = Th(r(E)), and {3] for every default rule a::M\u00a7t\ufffd .. ,M\u00a7n E D, if (a) a E f(E), and (b) \u2022/31 , ... , \u2022/3n \ufffd E, then 1 E r( E). E is an extension of\ufffd iff Eis a fixed point of r, that is, E:::: f(E).\n3.1 CONCEPTUAL DIFFICULTIES\nAt first glance, a default rule is very easy to under stand: if the prerequisite is true, and each of the jus tifications is possible, then infer by default the con sequent. Reiter first argued [Reiter, 1980] that nor mal defaults are expressive enough for most common sense applications. However, on closer inspection, de fault rules that appear intuitively reasonable in isola tion can give rise to unintuitive results when taken to gether [Reiter and Criscuolo, 1981; Lukaszewicz, 1985; Poole, 1989]. The facts and default rules may inter act in unexpected ways, and result in no extension or unwanted multiple extensions.\nWe argue that this problem is to be expected in the default logic framework. Consider the following canon ical normal default theory.\nExample 3 Ll- (D F) where D- {a:Mb a':M\ufffdb} .,. ' b ., --.b ' and F = {a, a'} . There are two extensions, E1 == Th({a,a',b}), and E2 == Th({a,a',-.b}). Which extension is better? Should we get rid of one, or should we keep both? Let us consider the following\nSequential Thresholds: Context Sensitive Default Extensions 439\npopular instantiations.\n\u2022 a: bird, a' :penguin, b: fly, we want only E2.\n\u2022 a: bird, a' : animal, b : fly, we want only E1.\n\u2022 a : quaker, a' : republican, b : pacifist, then we want to treat E1 and E2 equally.\nThe three instantiations are propositionally identical. Given the same default theory, we cannot expect the\nmechanism to generate different results. It is quite obvious that we, the \"intelligent beings\", are in pos session of some contextual information that leads us to want to draw different conclusions in the different ex amples. However, this additional information, which underlies our \"intuition\" in choosing between the ex tensions, is not available to the default theory as it is formulated above. The theory is indifferent to whether\na1 is supposed to stand for penguin or animal. Nor does it know that penguins are animals either. 0\nThis problem motivates semi-normal defaults [Reiter and Criscuolo, 1981], where an extra justification is used to denote \"non-exceptions\", so that the rule can only be applied when the object in question is not a known exception. For example, the default rules in the first case discussed above would be amended as follows.\n{ bird: M-.penguin 1\\ fly penguin: M-.fly\n} fly ' -.fly\nwhere the term -.penguin is added to the justification to prevent the rule from firing when the bird in ques tion is a penguin.\nThis amended rule works fine in this case, but there are many other exceptions to the \"birds typically fly\" rule. This leads to a qualification problem, where we need to have a longer and longer (3 in the justification part in order to cover all \"unintuitive\" cases. This seems to defeat the purpose of doing non-monotonic reasoning in the first place: we can as well explicitly list all exceptions, and revert to deductive inferences instead, which is not desirable even if feasible. \"Nam ing defaults\" [Poole, 1987) also has a similar problem.\n3.2 MISSING CONTEXT\nWe argue that this \"intuition problem\" arises because we are misled into thinking that we can formulate de fault rules that are modular. By that we mean the default rules are expected to \"do the right thing\" re gardless of what else is present in the environment. For example, the rule \"birds typically fly\" should fire when we only know that Tweety is a bird, but the same rule\nshould not fire when we know in addition that Tweety is a penguin. The incorporation of exceptions into the justification is an attempt to encode some of this con textual information into the rule itself, but this makes the rules very cumbersome and difficult to formulate.\nA much simpler approach is to take default rules as just one component of a non-monotonic reasoning system. We evaluate each default rule with respect to a con textual element which is encoded in some way external to the rule itself. An example of this approach is the use of inheritance and priority hierarchies [Touretzky, 1984; Horty et al., 1987] to determine the more spe cific or higher priority extension (s ). For example, from the inheritance hierarchy we know that penguins are a subclass of birds, and the more specific rule concerning penguins is given priority over the more general rule concerning birds.\nHowever, it is not always straightforward to establish a specificity hierarchy, especially when the classes con cerned do not have a strict set inclusion relation. For example, consider a world in which not all penguins are birds, that is, penguins are typically birds, but there are some exceptions. It is then not obvious on what basis we can claim that penguins are more spe cific than birds.1\n3.3 DYNAMICS OF THE CONTEXT\nWe pointed out that a default rule has to be evaluated relative to the context it is situated in. Now we also want to stress that this context is not a constant even if we only consider a single situation requiring default reasoning. Rather, the context is continuously evolv ing during the course of the reasoning process, as we draw more and more default conclusions.\nOne property that is present in many non-monotonic reasoning systems is that we can build upon the non monotonic conclusions drawn earlier to draw yet more non-monotonic conclusions. In default logic this cor responds to the chaining of default rules. Every time a default rule is applied, the consequent 'Y of that rule is added as part of the context available to the remain ing rules, and 'Y acquires virtually the same status as the statements in the original given set of facts F of the default theory in subsequent computations. The default consequent of one rule can act as the prerequi site of another rule, and the latter rule is dependent on the former to create the favorable conditions for itself. Thus, even within one reasoning episode, the relevant\n1 Of course all penguins are birds, but consider replacing \"birds\", \"fly\", and \"penguins\" with \"adults\", \"employed\", and \"university students\" [Reiter and Criscuolo, 1981], and we would need to show that \"university students\" are more specific than \"adults\" , a dubious assertion.\n440 Teng\ncontext is not a static component; rather each default rule operates within a different context.\nOne way to make this evolving context available to the reasoning machinery without explicitly and ex haustively listing all possibilities and conditions is to appeal to probability and the conditioning operation. Below we show a quantitative counterpart of default logic that retains its non-monotonic characteristic.\n4 SEQUENTIAL THRESHOLDING\nNow we present a probabilistic reasoning mechanism that is non-monotonic and very close in flavor to de fault logic. Sequential thresholding can be classified as a kind of probabilistic acceptance [Kyburg, 1961]. We accept a statement as true when its associated prob ability is high, say, above a certain threshold. The novelty here is that the thresholding is done sequen tially, that is, each statement is considered in turn, and all accepted statements participate in the conditioning of subsequent statements in determining whether they are above threshold.\nThe thresholding process can be thought of as a form of generalized conditioning. In regular conditioning, the conditional probability Pr(\ufffd I \u00a2) is computed when Pr( \u00a2) is assumed to have changed to 1. Thresholding imposes a weaker requirement: given a threshold pa rameter e, accept \u00a2if Pr(\u00a2) 2:: 1- e, and adjust the posterior probabilities of all statements as if they are conditioned on \u00a2. 2\nMore formally, we have the following definition.\nDefinition 4 A threshold collection C is an ordered pair (T, F), where T and F \ufffd \u00a3. We call T the thresh old set and F the fact set.\nA filtered sequence 11 of C = (T, F) with respect to the sequential threshold parameter e is a sequence (\u00a21, ... ,\u00a2n), such that {1} V\u00a2i in 11: \u00a2i E T and Pr(\u00a2i IF U {\u00a21, ... ,<f>;-d) \ufffd 1- e, and {2] V\u00a2 E T but not in 11, Pr(\u00a2 I F U { \u00a21, ... , \u00a2n}) < 1 -e.\nPr<l> ( 1/J), the threshold probability of\ufffd with respect to a filtered sequence 11 = {\u00a21, ... , \u00a2n) of C, is defined as Pr<\ufffd> ( 1/J) = Pr( \ufffd I F u { <f>1, . . . , <Pn}).\nThe filtered sequence 11 contains the formulas that we accept as true using the sequential thresholding pro cess. The threshold probability Pr<\ufffd> ( 1/J) is the probabil ity value of interest: the probability of 1j; conditioned on the facts F and all the formulas in the filtered se quence, which are the formulas we have decided to\n2The t: in the threshold does not tend to 0 in the limit, as in .:-semantics [Adams, 1975; Pearl, 1989], but is assumed to be some small quantity.\naccept.\nThe formulas in the fact set F do not need to be above threshold to enter into the computation of the thresh old probability. The formulas in the threshold set T, however, have to pass a threshold test in order to be included in the filtered sequence 11.\nThe value compared in the threshold test is the prob ability of \u00a2; conditioned on the facts F and all the formulas that have been entered into the filtered se quence before (h This sequence is maximal, in the sense that no other formula in T that is not already in 11 can be appended to the end of the sequence in accordance to the threshold test.\nNote that the effective probability space is shrinking. If Pr(\u00a2l1 I F) is above threshold, we then only con sider the space in which F and \u00a21 are true in sub sequent tests, and the probability distribution of in terest becomes Pr( * I F U { <f>t}), which becomes Pr( * I FU{ \u00a21 , \u00a22, ... <f>k}) as more formulas are admit ted into the filtered sequence. The probability value associated with a formula is technically unchanging: for example Pr( \ufffd I F U {<flo, \u00a21}) is invariant through out. Rather it is the \"context\" in which to compute the target probability value of 1/J that is continuously evolving, as we build the filtered sequence.\nNote also the sequential nature of how the thresh old test is administered. Since in general Pr(1/l I \u00a2o, . .. , \u00a2Jk) i- Pr('I/J lr/>o, ... , \u00a2lk1 \u00a2k+t), a formula that is below threshold at one point might become eligible for thresholding after we have taken a few other for mulas as true, and a formula that is above threshold at one point may not be so after we have thresholded some other formulas. In this sense, sequential thresh olding is non-monotonic; we commit to the truth of certain formulas when they become above threshold, and the probability distribution of interest is changed accordingly.\n5 DRAWING A PARALLEL\nIn this section, we characterize a generic non monotonic reasoning mechanism in terms of the con text that evolves as the computation progresses. This generic process can be instantiated in various ways to characterize various specific reasoning formalisms, in particular, default logic and sequential thresholding, thus providing a link between the two.\nInformally, a non-monotonic reasoning step can be de picted generically as follows.\n1. Find a non-monotonic rule that is applicable in the current context.\nSequential Thresholds: Context Sensitive Default Extensions 441\n2. Apply the rule, and accept its non-monotonic con clusion as true.\n3. Extend the context to reflect the addition of the newly inferred conclusion.\nAfter one cycle we find another rule that is applicable in the extended context, apply this rule, and add its non-monotonic conclusion to the new context, and the process repeats ...\nBoth default logic and sequential thresholding conform to this characterization. For simplicity, in the case of default logic, we give the instantiation for normal de fault theories only. Non-normal default theories re quire some additional consideration, but the results basically hold for the general case as well [Teng, 1997].\nNormal default theories have essentially the same structure as sequential thresholding. This can best be shown semantically by looking at the possible world partition sequences [Teng, 1996] of the generic non monotonic reasoning mechanism described above, and of its instantiations for these two specific formalisms.\n5.1 GENERIC NON-MONOTONIC PARTITION SEQUENCES\nA possible world is characterized by a truth assignment to all propositions in the language, and a real number weight. Given an exhaustive set of possible worlds W, a partition sequence of W is a tuple (W0, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , W1), l \ufffd 1, where the non-empty sets W; in the sequence form a partition3 of W.\nDefinition 5 A generic non-monotonic reasoning partition sequence can be characterized by the process Partitionw(B,R), as follows.\nInput An exhaustive set of possible worlds W, a set of background facts B, a set of non-monotonic rules R, each of the form r = (cond; res), where cond is the condition under which the rule r can be applied, and res is the non-monotonic conclusion to be inferred if r is indeed applied.\nOutput A partition sequence (W0, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , W1) depicting the non-monotonic reasoning process.\nProcess\nW0: Initialization Wo contains all the worlds in which the set of background facts B is false. W;: Non-monotonic Step For each W;, 0 < i < l , find a non-monotonic rule r = (cond; res) E R such that\n3 A partition of a set S is a set of non-empty sets sl, ... 'Sn, such that U; S; = s, and S; n Sj = 0 fori =I= j.\nApplicability cond is satisfied in the con text (W;, ... , Wz). Context Expansion All the worlds in which res is false are grouped into W;. The revised context of reference becomes (W;+l, ... , WI). W1: Closure Every rule in R whose cond is sat isfied in the context (WI) has been applied.\nGiven a set of facts B and a set of non-monotonic rules R, Parti tionw (B, R) describes one way of how a partition sequence characterizing the reasoning with respect to B and R progresses. Each reasoning step is performed with respect to a context (W;, . .. , Wz), which represents the body of information taken as true at the moment. The partition sequence can be seen as recording the change in this context as we draw more and more non-monotonic conclusions. The con text evolves, starting at (W0, ... , Wz), and changing to (W1, .. . , Wz), . . . , (W;, . . . , Wl), ... , until we reach (W1). Successive contexts differ by one formula res, which is the non-monotonic conclusion of the rule most recently applied.\nNote that some of the Wi'S may be empty. For exam ple, in the initialization step, if B is empty, then Wo is empty. The last class W1 in the partition sequence is of particular interest. It is the \"end-state\" of the reason ing process. In default logic, W1 represents a default extension, and in sequential thresholding, this corre sponds to the thresholded population. Also note that Partitionw(B, R) is not a function; there can be more than one partition sequence that can be constructed from the same initial parameters, such as when there are multiple extensions.\n5.2 INSTANTIATIONS\nNow we give the instantiations for normal default the ory and sequential thresholding respectively. We bor row the notation of modal logic: Da is taken to mean a is true in all worlds, O\"f is taken to mean 1 is true in some world, both with respect to the reference context (W;, ... , W1} in the following.\nTheorem 6 Given a normal default theory .6. = (D, F), a default partition sequence can be constructed by Partitionw(F,R), where\na\u00b7M1 R = { (Da 1\\ O\"f; \"/) : . E D}.\nI\nE is an extension of .6. iff there is a default partition sequence (Wo, ... , Wl) such that E is the set of sen tences true in all the worlds in wl.\nIn the following, let%(\u00a2) denote the weighted propor tion of worlds in which \u00a2 is true among the worlds in\n442 Teng\nthe context (W;, ... , W1).\nTheorem 7 Given a threshold collection C = (T, F) and a threshold parameter t, a sequential threshold partition sequence can be constructed by Parti tionw (F, R), where\nR={(%(\u00a2)\ufffd1-t; \u00a2}:\u00a2ET}.\nci> == (\u00a21, ... , \u00a21-I) is a filtered sequence of C at t iff there is a sequential threshold partition sequence (Wo, ... , W1/ such that r; = (%(\u00a2;) \ufffd 1- E; \u00a2;) is the rule used at step i. The threshold probability Pr <:\u00bb ( \ufffd) is the weighted proportion of worlds in which 1/J is true in \"Wi.\nThe partition sequences for normal default theories and sequential thresholding sport very similar condi tions. The set of facts used to construct W0 is given by a fact set F in both formalisms. In normal de fault theory, a default rule 0'\ufffd1 can be applied when o: is true and \"Y is possible in the current context of (W;, ... , Wz). After this rule is applied, we take \"Y as true, and exclude all those worlds in which \"Y is false when we construct the revised context (W;+l, ... , W1 ) .\nSimilarly in sequential thresholding, \u00a2; E T is ap pended to the filtered sequence when the proportion of worlds in which \u00a2; is true among those in the cur rent context (W;, ... , WI) is above threshold. After we have thresholded \u00a2;,we take\u00a2; to be true, and exclude all those worlds in which \u00a2; is false when we construct the revised context (WH1, .. . , W!)-\nFor default logic, the last class W1 determines what for mulas are present in that particular extension, while for sequential thresholding, wl represents the formu las we have accepted (the filtered sequence) and the threshold probabilities with respect to these formulas.\n6 SYMBIOSIS\nGiven the similarities regarding the structures of de fault logic and sequential thresholding, we can com bine them easily into a hybrid formalism that makes use of non-monotonic rules whose applicability condi tions involve both default logic style and probabilistic threshold style components. In this section we discuss how each formalism can benefit from the other in a hybrid arrangement.\n6.1 FINDING THE GOOD EXTENSIONS\nWe saw that unlike many other probabilistic for malisms, sequential thresholding is non-monotonic, in that previously thresholded formulas can enter into subsequent computations as ( defeasibly) true and not just highly probable statements.\nThe similarity in structure of sequential thresholding and default logic provides a link from \"intuition\" to probabilistically grounded rules, with respect to the specific context a default rule faces when it is applied during the reasoning process. This can be used to establish a context-sensitive metric for evaluating the relative \"goodness\" of multiple extensions, a situation often encountered in default logic.\nAn extension is constructed from a default theory \ufffd = {D, F) by starting with the set of facts F, and applying a sequence of default rules (d1, ... , d1_1) successively. Let each default rule be normal and of the form d; = a:;:\ufffd'\"fi. The same partition sequence corresponding to this default extension can be achieved by sequential thresholding, using F as the fact set and { -y1 , ... , 11-1} as the filtered sequence, with respect to some \u20ac large enough so that all the 1's can be above threshold.\nThere can be various ways to define a goodness mea sure of an extension as a function of this t: value. For example, one way is to take the minimum value fmin that would yield the extension in question. The se quential threshold 1 - Emin measures how probable the most improbable (in the sequential context) default consequent is among those of the default rules used in constructing the particular extension. We can consider an extension \"better\" than another if its associated minimum threshold parameter Emin is smaller.\nIn contrast to other works relating default logic to probability, such as [Pearl, 1989; Neufeld et al., 1990; Goldszmidt et al., 1990; Bacchus et al., 1993], sequen tial thresholding retains the non-monotonic nature of default logic. This gives a fairer measure of the good ness of an extension, since it obeys a fundamental principle motivating default logic. In particular, both default logic and sequential thresholding rely on the evolving context resulting from the non-monotonic ac ceptance of conclusions.\n6.2 WHAT'S IN IT FOR THRESHOLDING?\nSome may argue the main strength of default logic over probabilistic approaches is that we can avoid having to come up with messy numbers. Why, one would then ask, do we need to have default rules at all when we have the probabilities?\nPeople are not good at assigning numeric values to propositions. This difficulty alone provides a good in centive for seeking out formalisms that either do not make use of numeric information, or if they do, are not sensitive to perturbations in the numbers assigned. Se quential thresholding by itself is very sensitive to the value of the threshold parameter t: [Teng, 1996], and thus it makes more sense to use it as a companion\nSequential Thresholds: Context Sensitive Default Extensions 443\nmechanism for ranking default extensions rather than using it as a standalone reasoning mechanism. We are not as dependent on the actual numbers assigned when we only need to use them as a way to determine the relative goodness of the extensions.\nAnother problem of thresholding concerns the compo sition of the threshold set T, which contains the formu las we will attempt to threshold. Sequential threshold ing does not deal with how we come up with this set. However, there is no reason to assume that we should threshold exhaustively until there are no more formu las above threshold (except tautologies), nor that it suffices to try arbitrary formulas. Until we have a reli able way of automatically generating candidates of \"in teresting and relevant\" formulas, we need some mecha nism for directing the thresholding process to focus on the formulas of our choice. Logical contraptions such as default logic provide a concise and well defined tool for expressing preferences in choosing the next formula to threshold.\n6.3 EXAMPLE\nAn extended example is not possible here due to space limitation, but we will reuse the canonical Example 3 to give a sense of how the different formalisms com pare.\nA partition sequence corresponding to E1 is 51 = (Wa, Wb, We), where\nWa { {...,a, ...,a', -,b}, {-,a, -,a', b }, {-,a, a', ..,b}, {-,a, a', b}, {a, ..,a', -,b}, {a, ..,a', b} },\nwb { {a, a' -,b}}' We {{a,a',b}}.\nA partition sequence corresponding to E2 is 52 = (Wa, We, Wb)\u00b7 In sequential threshold terms, we have a threshold col lection (T,F), where T = {b,-,b}, and F = {a,a'}. The partition sequence 51 characterizes the sequen tial thresholding process with respect to the filtered sequence (b), while s2 can be generated with the fil tered sequence (-.b). The minimum f that would yield 51 is the weighted proportion of worlds in Wb among those in both Wb u We. The minimum f for 52 is the weighted proportion of We with respect to Wb u We.\nNow consider the instantiation a: bird, a' : penguin, b: fly. We know that flying penguins are quite rare, but how rare? The constraints on the magnitude of the weights assigned to the worlds in order to make E2 more favorable than Et is very loose: we just need to make sure that the weight of {a, a', b} (flying pen guins) is smaller than the weight of {a, a', -,b} (non flying penguins). This will ensure that the minimum\ne required for s2 is smaller than that for sl.\nIt is very obvious in this toy example that the weights of the two worlds in question should differ greatly. However, in more complicated situations, we may only have a vague idea of the distribution of weights, and it would be helpful to know that there can be some leeway in the specification.\n7 CONCLUSION\nIn non-monotonic reasoning, we accept certain conclu sions as true although we do not know for sure that they are. All subsequent reasoning is carried out with the assumption that these accepted conclusions are in deed true. We argued that the problem of choosing be tween multiple extensions in default logic is due to the lack of contextual information. The evolving context during the course of the reasoning process is important in determining the \"intuition\" behind a default rule. This context can be made accessible in a few ways, one of which is sequential thresholding, a quantitative non-monotonic formalism that is very similar in spirit to default logic. Sequential thresholds can be used to evaluate the goodness of default extensions by access ing how probable each default rule is with respect to the continuously evolving context.\nWe presented a generic semantic characterization of non-monotonic reasoning, as well as the instantia tions pertaining to normal default logic and sequen tial thresholding. This progressive addition of conclu sions to the context, or the progressive restriction of admissible sets of possible worlds in (Wi, ... , W1), is the crux of non-monotonic reasoning: the conclusions of the applied rules are taken as true, and the worlds in which these non-deductive conclusions are false are eliminated from further consideration.\nWe stress here that the rules are not modular, in the sense that they are not intended to be specified in a way that makes them independent of the rest of the rules and facts. On the contrary, the applicability con dition cond of a rule depends critically on the current context, which is an environment created by the facts and the use of other rules. A more rigorous formaliza tion of the generic non-monotonic partition sequences and further discussion can be found in [Teng, 1997).\nAcknowledgements\nMany thanks to my advisor Henry Kyburg, for his many comments and repeated assurance that this is interesting, and for his NSF grant IRI-9411267.\n444 Teng\nReferences\n[Adams, 1975) Ernest W.
