Even though the correct working of these schemes is practically con\u00ad tingent upon the existence of a small number of probable states, no formal justification has been proposed of why this should be the case. This paper attempts to fill this apparent gap by studying asymmetries among probabili\u00ad ties of various states of uncertain models. By rewriting the joint probability distribu\u00ad tion over a model's variables into a product of individual variables' prior and conditional probability distributions and applying cen\u00ad tral limit theorem to this product, we can demonstrate that the probabilities of indi\u00ad vidual states of the model can be expected to be drawn from highly skewed lognormal distributions. With sufficient asymmetry in individual prior and conditional probability distributions, a small fraction of states can be expected to cover a large portion of the total probability space with the remaining states having practically negligible probabil\u00ad ity. Theoretical discussion is supplemented by simulation results and an illustrative real\u00ad world example.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
