It differs from existing simulation methods in that it starts simulation from the known evidence and works backward (i.e., contrary to the direction of the arcs). The technique's focus on the evidence leads to improved convergence in situations where the posterior beliefs are dominated by the evidence rather than by the prior probabilities. Since this class of situations is large, the technique may make practical the application of approximate inference in Bayesian belief networks to many real\ufffdworld problems.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
