In such languages the terminological formalism ( TBox) is used to rep resent a hierarchy of terms (concepts) that are par tially ordered by a subsumption relation: concept B is subsumed by concept A, if, and only if, the set of B's real world objects is necessarily a. sub set of A's world objects. In this sense, the seman tics of such languages can be based on set theory. Tw\ufffdplace relations (roles) are used to describe con cepts. In the case of defined concepts, restrictions on roles represent both necessary and sufficient con ditions. For primitive concepts, only necessary con-\nditions are specified. The algorithm called classi fier inserts new generic concepts at the most spe cific place in the terminological hierarchy according to the subsumption relation. Work on terminologi cal languages led further to hybrid representation sys tems. Systems like BACK, CLASSIC, LOOM, KANDOR, KL-TWO, KRIS, KRYPTON, MESON, SB-ONE, and YAK (for overview and analyses see [Sigart Bulletin, 1991; Heinsohn et al., 1994]) make use of a separation of terminological and assertional knowledge.\nSince, on the one hand, the idea of terminological rep resentation is essentially based on the possibility of defining concepts (or at least specifying necessary con ditions), the classifier can be employed to draw correct inferences. On the other hand, characterizing domain concepts only categorically can lead to problems, es pecially in domains where certain important proper ties cannot be used as part of a. concept definition. This may happen especially in real world applications where, besides their description, terms can only be characterized as having additional typical properties or properties that are, for instance, usually true. In the real world such properties often are only tendencies. Until now, tendencies as well as differences in these tendencies have not been considered in the framework of terminological logics.\nWhile, as argued above, classical terminological knowl edge representation excludes the possibility of handling uncertain concept descriptions, purely numerical ap proaches for handling uncertainty (see, e.g., [Kruse et al., 1991]) in general are unable to consider termino logical knowledge. The basic idea underlying the for malism presented in this paper is to generalize termi nological logics by using probabilistic semantics and in this way to close the gap between the two areas of research.\nThis paper presents the language .AIXP [Heinsohn, 1993) which is a. probabilistic extension of termin\ufffd logical logics and allows one to handle the problems discussed above. First, we briefly introduce .Alr [Schmidt-Schau8 and Smolka, 1991], a propositionally complete terminological language containing the logi cal connectives conjunction, disjunction and negation,\n312 Heinsohn\nas well as role quantification. In Section 3 we extend ACC by defining the syntax and semantics of probabilis tic conditioning (l'conditioning), a construct aimed at considering uncertain knowledge sources and based on a statistical interpretation. In Section 4 we introduce the formal model underlying both the terminological and the probabilistic formalism. We further charac terize the classes of probabilities induced by a termi nology and a set of l'conditionings. As demonstrated in Section 5, a set of consistency requirements have to be met on the basis of terminological and proba bilistic knowledge. Moreover, the developed interval valued probabilistic constraints allow the inference of implicitly existent probabilistic relationships and their quantitative computation. Related work and the con clusions are given in Sections 6 and 7, respectively. The research presented in this paper completes our earlier investigations that introduced first probabilistic constraints [Heinsohn, 1991] and discussed the impor tance of subsumption computation in the framework of probabilistic knowledge lHeinsohn, 1992].\n2 THE TERMINOLOGICAL FORMALISM\nThe basic elements of the terminoloe;ical language ACC [Schmidt-SchauB and Smolka, 1991j are concepts and roles (denoting subsets of the domain of interest and binary relations over this domain, respectively). As sume that T (\"top\", denoting the entire domain) and .l (\"bottom\", denoting the empty set) are concept symbols, that A denotes a concept symbol, and R de notes a role. Then the concepts (denoted by letters C and D) of the language .ACC are built according to the abstract syntax rule\nc, D -+ A I T I .l enD CUD -.c VR:C 3R:C\natomic concepts concept conjunction concept disjunction concept negation value restriction existential restriction\nWith an introduction to formal semantics of ACC in mind, we give a translation into set theoretical expres sions with 1> being the domain of discourse. For that purpose, we define a mapping f: that maps every con cept description to a subset of 1> and every role to a subset of 1> x 1> in the following way:\n&[T] = &[.l]\n&[(CnD)] &[(CUD)]\n& [(..,c)] = &[{VR: C)]\n\u00a3[{3R : C)] =\n1> 0 &[C] n &[D] &[C] U &[D] 'D \\&[C) { x E 1> I for all y E 'D :\n( (x, y) E E[R]:::;. y E &[C))} {x E 1>1 there exists y E 'D: ((x,y) E &[R]Ay E &[C])}\nConcept descriptions are used to state necessary, or necessary and sufficient conditions by means of special izations \" !;;;;; \" or definitions \" :::::\" , respectively. Assum ing symbol A and concept description C, then \"A !;;;;; C\" means the inequality &[A] \ufffd \u00a3[ C], and \"A ::::: C\" means the equation &[A]= &[C). A set of well formed concept definitions and specializations forms a termi nology, if every concept symbol appears at most once on the left hand side and there are no terminological cycles.\nDefinition 1 LetT be a terminology. The set\nmod(T) \ufffdr {\u00a31\u00a3 extension function ofT} (1) is called set of models ofT.\nA concept C1 is said to be subsumed by a concept C2 in a terminology T, written Ct :jr C2, iff the inequal ity E[Ct] \ufffd \u00a3[C2] holds for all extension functions satisfying the equations introduced in T (i.e., for all f: E mod(T)). Terminological languages as .ACC can be usefully &I' plied to categorical world knowledge. For instance, we may introduce\nExample 1 animal C flying C\nantarctic_animal C bird -\nantarctic_bird - penguin C T T animal animaln (Vmoves_by: flying) antarctic_animaln bird antarctic_bird\nTo characterize the expressiveness of terminological languages, we examine the different relations imagin able between two concept extensions, i.e., inclusion, disjointness, and overlapping: Inclusion can be caused by terminological subsumption. For instance, in Ex ample 1 the set of penguins is known to be a subset of the set of antarctic birds. Also disjointness can be a terminological property. For instance, the above lan guage construct \"concept negation\" used in the expres sion Ct!;;;;; C, C2::::: (Cn ...,ct) implies &[Ct] n \u00a3[C2] = 0. However, the information of overlapping concept extensions cannot be expressed and used in classical terminological logics. The importance of having such language constructs becomes obvious, if we examine the above birds' taxonomy in more detail: Because of terminological subsumption, the flying property of birds is inherited also to the penguin concept. How ever, it is well known that concerning this aspect pen guins represent a real exception, so that the (categori cal) definition of birds seems also to be inadequate: At best \"most birds move by flying\" or are flying objects that are defined to move by flying. It seems to be more suitable to consider generally the \"degree of intersec tion\" between the respective concept's extensions and to characterize it using an appropriate technique. The idea behind this generalization is to use probabilistic semantics.\n3 PROBABILISTIC CONDITIONING\nIn the following we consider only one representative for equivalent concept expressions (such as A, AnT, AnA). The algebra based on representatives of equiv alence classes and on the logical connectives n , U , and ..., is known as Lindenbaum algebra of the set S of concept symbols. We use the symbol C for the set of concept descriptions. Domain 'D is assumed to be finite. As a language construct that takes into account overlapping concept extensions, we introduce the notion of p-conditioning: the language construct\nC1 !P\ufffd .. J C2 is called p-conditioning, iff [p1, p,.] is a subrange of real numbers with 0 \ufffd PI \ufffd Pu \ufffd 1 and C1, C2 E C. The semantic is defined as follows: Definition 2 An extension function \u00a3 over C satisfies\nd \u2022t. . c fp, ,p .. J c \u2022tt L- c [PI ,p .. J G a p-eon 1 aonmg 1 -t 2, wn en r-e 1 -t 21 iff\nI\u00a3[C1nC2]I I\u00a3[C1]I\n(2)\nholds for concepts Ct, C2 E C, \u00a3[Ct] :f. 0.\nIn case of Pl = Pu we simply write C1 4 C2 with p = PI = Pu instead of Ct [p\ufffd .. ] c2. From the above it is obvious that we use the relative cardinality for inter preting the notion of p-conditioning. For illustrating the meaning of Definition 2, assume that an observ er examines the flying ability of birds in more detaiL When finishing his study he may have learned that, un like the model of Example 1, relation moves_by:jlying holds only for a certain percentage of the birds. The notion ofp-conditioning now allows a representation of universal knowledge of statistical kind in a way that maintains the semantics of the roles: the new concept flying_object is created with role moves_ by restricted to the range flying. The uncertainty is represented by a p-conditioning stating that \"at least 95% of birds are jlying_objects that, by definition, all move by flying\". The now more detailed view of the example world leads to the following revision of Example 1: Example 2 (revises Example 1}\nanimal C T flying \ufffd T\nflying_ob;\"ect -=- 'r/moves_by :flying antarctic-animal C animal\nbird !;;;:; animal antarctic_bird - antarctic_animaln bird\npenguin C antarctic_bird bJ.rd [0.95,1] fl . b. -t ymg_o ')ect bird 04\u00b0 antarctic_bird\npenguin \ufffd flying_object This demonstrates that set theory is sufficient for a consistent semantic basis on which both terminologi-\nProbabilistic Description Logics 313\ncal and probabilistic language constructs can be inter preted. On this basis, the p-conditioning serves also as a generalization of both \"inclusion\" and \"disjointness\" (now appearing as A4B and A\ufffd B. respectively). Example 2 shows not only an adequate representation of the fact that \"most (i.e., ;::: 95%) birds are flying objects\" but also that \"20% of the birds are antarctic birds\" and \"no penguin is a flying object\". This direct ly leads to the question in which way inferences can be drawn on the basis of terminological and probabilistic knowledge to infer implicitly existent relationships. In fact, Example 2 implicitly covers the knowledge, that \"at least 75% of antarctic birds are flying objects\" and that \"at most 5% of birds are penguins\", for instance. For this, we first introduce the formal model based on classes of probabilities and then derive the associated probabilistic constraints.\n4 THE FORMAL MODEL\nIn concrete application domains, knowledge about un certain concept relations generally exists only for some pairs of concepts of a terminology-neither direct ly representable statistical knowledge nor textbook knowledge is complete in this sense. Consequent ly, the question arises in which way, starting with a set of models restricted with respect to terminology and p-conditionings, one can infer (uncertain) rela tionships between those pairs of concepts for which p conditionings are not explicitly introduced. Below we give an answer to this question by defining the sets of entailed and minimal p-conditionings. The first part of the definition considers the fact that the set of models of a terminology (see equation ( 1)) is generally refined if p-conditionings are introduced.\nDefinition 3 Let 7 be a terminology and I be a set of p-conditionings. Then\nmodr(Z) \ufffdr {\u00a3I F=e Z} n mod(T) (3) is called the set of models of I wrt. /.\nThr(Z) \ufffd{I I for all\u00a3 E modr(I) : f:e I} (4) is called the set of entailed p-conditionings wrt. I and 7.\nminr(I) \ufffdr U {CR.!!\u00a5\u2022 D j Rrnin = n R} (5) C,DEC R: \ufffdDEThr(I) is called the set of minimal p-conditionings wrt. I and 7. These definitions-especially the set defined in (5) describe a formal model that characterizes the com putation of p-conditionings introduced not explicitly and the further refinement of p-conditionings that are known. Note that both sets (4) and (5) contain p conditionings for all pairs of concepts. Further note that ( 4) generally is of infinite size: For instance, if a\n314 Heinsohn\nd. \u00b7 \u00b7 c (p.,p\ufffd1 c \u00b7 \u00b7 fi d b \u00b7 p-eon ttlonmg 1 -t 2 ts satls e y all extensiOn functions in modr (I), then all p-conditionings with ranges that cover [p1, P2] are also satisfied, i.e.,\n( C1 [p\ufffd,J C,.) E Thr (I) ::} ( C1 [q\ufffd,J c,_) E Thr(I)\nholds for all 91, q2 E [0, 1], 91 ::::; Pt1 P2 ::::; q2. While Thr (I) generally is of infinite size, set minr (I) de fined in (5) contains exactly one p-conditioning for one pair of concepts.\nDefinition 4 a) A set I of p-conditionings is called consistent wrt. 7, iff modr (I) ::f 0 holds. b) A concept C1 is said to be subsumed by a concept C2 wrt. T andi, writtenC1 j r,x C2 , iffthe inequality E[Ct] c; E[C2] holds for all extension functions t: E modr(I).\nIt can be shown that all minimal sets Rmin of real num bers defined in (5) form ranges as it is the case for ex plicitly introduced p-conditionings. This is due to the convexity property of those probability classes that are induced by terminological axioms and p-conditionings over the set of atomic concept expressions. In the fol lowing we focus on this aspect.\nIn addition to the symbol C for the set of concept descriptions We use CA for the set of atomic concept expressions (i.e., the atoms of the Lindenbaum al gebra). Atomic concept expressions are of the form Bt n B2 n . . . n Bm I where B; is either a concept sym bol A or the negation ...,A of a symbol. The relation cA c; c holds. A first simple observation is that for every extension function t: E modr(I) the set of ex tensions of the elements in CA forms a partition of V. A direct consequence of this observation is that every extension function e uniquely determines a probability over CA.\nProposition 1 Let T be a terminology and I be a consistent set of p-conditionings. Further, let t: E modr(I) be an extension function for which\nI= TPic:- . \ufffd lt:lcnl , ll c:- cA e \ufffd I ' p, lVI Jor a I E (6)\nholds. Then the real-valued set function Pe defined by\nPe: 'fA---+ [0,1], Pe({c;-}) \ufffd p;, c;- E cA (7) is a probability function over CA.\nProof: Lett: be an extension function for which (6) holds. Since t: induces a partition of V and because of the semantic (2) of p-conditionings we derive\nPe(CA) = 1, Pe(D;) \ufffd 0 for all D; c; CA,\nPe(D, U Dj) = Pe(D.) + Pe(Dj) if D, n Dj = 0. Consequently, Pt: is a probability function over cA . \u2022\nExample 3 Assume the set 7 = {A!;T,B!;T,C:::::AnB}\nof terminological axioms. From S = {T, A, B} we ob tain cA = {-,An-,B,-.AnB,AnB,An-,B}. Then, e and v with lVI = 100, IE[A]I = 40, IE[B]I = 20,IE[AnB]I = 10 induce a probability function\nPt: : ...,An -.B t-+ 0.5 -.AnB t-+ 0.1\nAnB \ufffd--+ 0.1 An ...,B t-+ 0.3.\nNote that every concept can be represented as a dis junction of atomic concept expressions, i.e., for everr concept expression C E C there exists a subset D C C of atoms such that C = UD. In this way Pe c\ufffd be extended to concept expressions. In particular,\nPc(T) Pc( U cA) = 1 , Pe(C) > 0 for all C E C ,\nPt:(C; UCj) = P\u00a3(C;) + Pe(Cj) if C; nCj ::$r,z .L hold, so that Pe defined by\nPe : C -t [0, 1], Pt:(C) \ufffdr\nc- :C- ED ,DI;;CA ,C= U D is a probability function over C. Example 3 shows that, assuming complete knowledge of domain V and of the involved cardinalities, a proba bility function Pe over cA is induced by the extension function t:. However, it is generally more realistic to assume less complete knowledge and cardinalities that are rather relative. Consequently, the set modr(I) generally contains more than one element, so that a class of probabilities is induced by a terminology and a set of p-conditionings. The most general set of all probabilities over CA is defined by\nM \ufffd {(pl, ... ,pn)E\ufffd\"IPt+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+Pn=1, p, \ufffd 0 for all 1 ::::; i $ n},\nwith n = 2m. Without any knowledge about termi nology and p-conditionings the set M characterizes the status of complete ignorance. On the other hand, for a particular extension function e I the set M con sists of exactly one point in the n-dimensional space [0,1]\". In the case of the given terminology 7 and p-conditionings I, by (3) a set modr(I) of extension functions and also a. set\nMr,z \ufffdc {(p1 , ... ,Pn) EM I exists E E modr(I): Pj = P\u00a3( { Cj}), j = 1, . . . , n}\nof probabilities are defined. Mr,z corresponds to the set of probabilities in M that are compatible with T and all p-conditionings in I.\nProposition 2 For every consistent T and I the set Mr,z = n/EZ Mr,{I} is convex. Proof: We show that p-conditionings can be repre sented as linear combinations of atomic concept ex. A d\" . . I C [qr ,qu) C presswns. ssume p-eon 1tlonmg : 1 -t 2, Ct. C2 E C. I can be rewritten as\nPt:(C1 nC2) \ufffd q, \u00b7 Pe(CI), qu \u00b7 Pe(CI) \ufffd Pe(Cl nC2), (8)\nif Pe(Ct) # 0. With CA as the set of atoms of the Lindenbaum algebra, the concept expressions C1 n C2 and cl can be substituted by disjunctions of atomic expressions:\nk I c1nC2=U. c1., Ct=U. c1., k \ufffd l.\nJ=l J J=l J\nTherefore, both inequalities (8) can be represented by expressions of the general form\nn n\n\u00b7z::>\u2022P\u2022 \ufffd I:y;p,,witbp, = Pt({Ci}), c,- ECA i=l i=l\nwhere z, (Yi) is 0 if the corresponding concept disjunc tion does not contain c,-' and qu (ql) or 1 otherwise. Making use of Zi = x; -Yo we derive the general rep resentation L\ufffd=l z;p; \ufffd 0 of the inequalities and the set\nn\n{(pl,\u2022 .. ,pn) E M I I:ziPi \ufffd 0} i=l\nwith appropriate values z;. Using a geometric interpre tation, each inequality defines a (convex) hyperplane. Since the intersection of convex regions is known to be always convex, Mr,z = n/eZ Mr,{I} is convex, too. \u2022\nThis convexity property represents a sufficient condi tion for the existence of the intersections used in (5) and of the probabilistic constraints derived below .1"}, {"heading": "5 PROBABILISTIC CONSTRAINTS", "text": "In the following, we focus on probabilistic constraints corresponding to the formal model introduced above.

Further, not as yet known p-conditionings can be generated and the associated probability ranges can be stepwise re fined. In the general case, testing probabilistic consis tency leads, for every p-conditioning, to a successive computing of the intersections of probability ranges derived from different local examinations.\n6 RELATED WORK\nThe importance of providing an integration of both term classification and uncertainty representation3 was recently emphasized in some publications. How ever, they differ from each other and also from our work. For example, Yen [1991] proposes an extension of term subsumption languages to fuzzy logic that aims at representing and handling vague concepts. His ap proach generalizes a subsumption test algorithm for dealing with the notion of vagueness and imprecision. Since the language .ALCP aims at modeling uncertain ty, it already differs from Yen's proposal in its general objectives. Saffiotti [1990] presents a hybrid frame work for representing epistemic uncertainty. His ex tension allows one to model uncertainty about categor ical knowledge, e.g., to express one's belief on quanti fied statements such as \"I am fairly (80%) sure that all birds fly\". Note the difference from \"I am sure that 80% of birds fly\", which is modeled in this paper and requires a different formal basis. The work of Bacchus [1990] is important because he not only explores the question of how far one can go using statistical knowl edge but also presents LP, a logical formalism for rep resenting and reasoning with statistical knowledge. In spite of being closely related to our work, Bacchus does not provide a deep discussion of conditionals and the associated local consistency requirements.\nFrom the viewpoint of interval-valued probabilistic constraints, our work has been influenced by the early paper [Dubois and Prade, 1988], where first probabilis tic constraints were presented. In this framework the system INFERNO [Quinlan, 1983] also has to be men tioned since it is based on the intuition of comput ing \"maximally consistent ranges\" underlying the lan guage .AJrP. Probabilistic constraints that are related to our work were independently developed by Thone et al. [1992] in the context of deductive databas es and by Armarger et aL [Amarger et al., 1991;\n3Brachman [1990] considers \"probability and statis tics\" as one of the ''potential highlights\" in knowledge representation.\nProbabilistic Description Logics 317\nDubois et al., 1992]. Thone et al. presented an im proved upper bound for the interval-valued situation discussed in Proposition 4. Their result allowed us to refine our earlier constraints and has been adopt ed in this paper. One basic difference to the work on constraints discussed above is that the terminological formalism of .AfJ::P allows for subsumption computa tion and for correctly handling logically interrelated concepts. One consequence is that the integrated ter minological and probabilistic formalism is able to ap ply refined constraints if necessary [Heinsohn, 1991; Heinsohn, 1992].\nWhile this paper focuses mainly on terminological and probabilistic aspects of generic knowledge, the consid eration of assertions would mean the ability to draw inferences about \"probabilistic memberships\" of in stances and associated belief values. A corresponding extension of .A\u00a3rP that is based on probability distri butions over both, domains and worlds, is described in [Heinsohn , 1993]. If we enlarge our discussion of related work to this borderline between statistical and belief knowledge and to the question how statistical knowledge can be used to derive beliefs, other work has to be mentioned, too: While Bacchus et al. [1992] and Shastri [1989] examine this question in the general frameworks of first-order lo\ufffdic and semantic networks, respectively, in [Jager, 1994j an extension of termin\ufffd logical logics is presented. While Jager employs croes entropy minimization to derive beliefs, the assertional formalism of .AJrP makes use of the maximally con sistent ranges derived in the generic knowledge base. Finally, it is worth pointing out that the constraint interpretation used in this paper is only one of sev eral conceivable ways of integrating probabilities with terminological logics.\n7 CONCLUSIONS\nWe have proposed the language .ACCP which is a prob abilistic extension of terminological logics. The knowl edge, that .ACCP allows us to handle, includes termi nological knowledge covering term descriptions and un certain knowledge about (not generally true) concept properties. For this purpose, the notion of probabilistic conditioning based on a statistical interpretation has been introduced. The developed formal framework for terminological and probabilistic language constructs has been based on classes of probabilities that offer a modeling of ignorance as one special feature. Proba bilistic constraints allow the context-related generation and refinement of p-conditionings and check the con sistency of the knowledge base. It has been shown that the results of the constraints essentially depend on the correctness of the terminology which is guaranteed by the subsumption algorithm. More details about the language .AfJ::P, the formal framework, the associated interval-valued constraints, proofs, and other related work can be found in [Heinsohn, 1993]. There, an ex tension for assertional knowledge is also offered.\n318 Heinsohn\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank Bernhard Nebel and the anony mous referees for their valuable comments on earlier versions of this paper.
