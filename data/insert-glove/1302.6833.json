The main result of this paper is the incremental extension of the singly connect\u00ad ed polytree network in such a way that the network retains its singly connected polytree structure after the changes. The algorithm is deterministic and is guaranteed to have a complexity of single node addition that is at most of order proportional to the number of nodes (or size) of the network. Addition\u00ad al speed-up can be achieved by maintaining the path information. Despite its incremental and dynamic nature, the algorithm can also be used for probabilistic inference in belief networks in a fashion similar to other exact inference algorithms.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
