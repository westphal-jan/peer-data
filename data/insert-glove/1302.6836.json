We present an algorithm which computes conditional plans of maximum expected utility. This algorithm relies on a representation of the search space as an AND/OR tree and employs a depth-limit to control computation costs. A numeric robustness factor, which parameterizes the utility function, allows the user to modulate the degree of risk-aversion employed by the planner. Via a look-ahead search, the planning algorithm seeks to fmd an optimal plan using expected utility as its optimization criterion. We present experimental results obtained by applying our algorithm to a non-deterministic extension of the blocks world domain. Our results demonstrate that the robustness factor governs the degree of risk embodied in the conditional plans computed by our algorithm.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
