Language models, which play a crucial role in speech recognizers and machine translation systems, are particularly sensitive to such changes, unless some form of adaptation takes place. One approach to speech language model adaptation is self-training, in which a language model\u2019s parameters are tuned based on automatically transcribed audio. However, transcription errors can misguide self-training, particularly in challenging settings such as conversational speech. In this work, we propose a model that considers the confusions (errors) of the ASR channel. By modeling the likely confusions in the ASR output instead of using just the 1-best, we improve self-training efficacy by obtaining a more reliable reference transcription estimate. We demonstrate improved topic-based language modeling adaptation results over both 1-best and lattice selftraining using our ASR channel confusion estimates on telephone conversations."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Modern statistical automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems rely on language models for ranking hypotheses generated from acoustic data. Language models are trained on millions of words (or more) taken from text that matches the spoken language, domain and style of interest. Reliance on (static) training data makes language models brittle (Bellegarda, 2001) to changes in domain. However, for\nmany problems of interest, there are numerous hours of spoken audio but little to no written text for language model training. In these settings, we must rely on language model adaptation using the spoken audio to improve performance on data of interest. One common approach to language model adaptation is self-training (Novotney et al., 2009), in which the language model is retrained on the output from the ASR system run on the new audio. Unfortunately, self-training learns from both correct and error ridden transcriptions that mislead the system, a particular problem for high word error rate (WER) domains, such as conversational speech. Even efforts to consider the entire ASR lattice in self-training cannot account for the ASR error bias. Worse still, this is particularly a problem for rare content words as compared to common function words; the fact that content words are more important for understandability exacerbates the problem.\nConfusions in the ASR output pose problems for other applications, such as speech topic classification and spoken document retrieval. In high-WER scenarios, their performance degrades, sometimes considerably (Hazen and Richardson, 2008).\nIn this work, we consider the problem of topic adaptation of a speech recognizer (Seymore and Rosenfeld, 1997), in which we adapt the language model to the topic of the new speech. Our novelty lies in the fact that we correct for the biases present in the output by estimating ASR confusions. Topic proportions are estimated via a probabilistic graphical model which accounts for confusions in the transcript and provides a more accurate portrayal of the spoken audio. To demonstrate the util-\nity of our model, we show improved results over traditional self-training as well as lattice based selftraining for the challenging setting of conversational speech transcription. In particular, we show statistically significant improvements for content words.\nNote that Bacchiani et al. (2004) also consider the problem of language model adaptation as an error correction problem, but with supervised methods. They train an error-correcting perceptron model on reference transcriptions from the new domain. In contrast, our approach does not assume the existence of transcribed data for training a confusion model; rather, the model is trained in an unsupervised manner based only on the ASR output.\nThe paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes our setting of language model adaptation and our topic based language model. Section 3 presents a language model adaptation process based on maximum-likelihood and maximum-aposteriori self-training, while Section 4 introduces adaptation that utilizes ASR channel estimates. Section 5 describes experiments on conversational speech."}, {"heading": "2 Language Model Adaptation", "text": "We are given a trained speech recognizer, topicbased language model and a large collection of audio utterances (many conversations) for a new domain, i.e. a change of topics, but not manually transcribed text needed for language model training. Our goal is to adapt the language model by learning new topic distributions using the available audio. We consider self-training that adapts the topic distributions based on automatically transcribed audio.\nA conversation C is composed of N speech utterances are represented by N lattices (confusion networks) \u2013 annotated with words and posterior probabilities \u2013 produced by the speech recognizer. 1 Each confusion network consists of a sequence of bins, where each bin is a set of words hypothesized by the recognizer at a particular time. The i-th bin is denoted by bi and contains words {wi,j}|V|j=1, where V is the vocabulary. 2 When obvious from context, we\n1We assume conversations but our methods can be applied to non-conversational genres.\n2Under specific contexts, not all vocabulary items are likely to be truly spoken in a bin. Although we use summations over all w \u2208 V , we practically use only words which are acoustically confusable and consistent with the lexical context of the bin.\nomit subscript j. The most likely word in bin bi is denoted by w\u0302i. Let M be the total number of bins in the N confusion networks in a single conversation.\nWe use unigram topic-based language models (multinomial distributions over V), which capture word frequencies under each topic. Such models have been used in a variety of ways, such as in PLSA (Hofmann, 2001) and LDA (Blei et al., 2003), and under different training scenarios. Topic-based models provide a global context beyond the local word history in modeling a word\u2019s probability, and have been found especially useful in language model adaptation (Tam and Schultz, 2005; Wang and Stolcke, 2007; Hsu and Glass, 2006). Each topic t \u2208 {1, . . . , T} has a multinomial distribution denoted by q(w|t), w \u2208 V . These topic-word distributions are learned from conversations labeled with topics, such as those in the Fisher speech corpus.3\nAdapting the topic-based language model means learning a set of conversation specific mixture weights \u03bbC = (\u03bbC1 , . . . , \u03bb C T ), where \u03bb C t indicates the likelihood of seeing topic t in conversation C.4 While topic compositions remain fixed, the topics selected change with each conversation.5 These mixture weights form the true distribution of a word:\nq(w) = T\u2211 t=1 \u03bbtq(w|t).

We consider self-training based on 1-best and lattice maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) as well as maximum-aposteriori (MAP) training. In the next section, we modify these approaches to incorporate our confusion estimates.\nFor estimating the topic mixtures \u03bb using selftraining on the 1-best ASR output, i.e. the 1-best path in the confusion network w\u0302 = {w\u0302i}Mi=1, we write the log-likelihood of the observations w\u0302:\nL(1) = M\u2211 i=1 log q(w\u0302i), (2)\n3Alternative approaches estimate topics from unlabeled data, but we use labeled data for evaluation purposes.\n4Unless required we drop the superscript C. 5This assumption can be relaxed to learn q(w|t) as well.\nwhere q is a mixture of topic models (1), for mixture weights \u03bb. We expect topic-based distributions will better estimate the true word distribution than the empirical estimate q\u0302(w) = 1M \u2211M i=1 1(w\u0302i = w), as the latter is biased due to ASR errors.

By modeling these confusions we can guide self-training and recover from recognition errors.\nThe ASR channel confusion model is represented by a conditional probability distribution pc(v|w), v, w \u2208 V , which denotes the probability that the most likely word in the output of the recognizer (i.e., the \u201c1-best\u201d word) is v, given that the true (reference) word spoken is w. Of course, this conditional distribution is just an approximation as many other phenomena \u2013 coarticulation, non-stationarity of speech, channel variations, lexical choice in the context, etc. \u2013 cause this probability to vary. We assume that pc(v|w) is an \u201caverage\u201d of the conditional probabilities under various conditions.\nWe use the following simple procedure for estimating the ASR channel, similar to that of (Xu et al., 2009) for computing cohort sets:\n\u2022 Create confusion networks (Mangu et al., 1999) with the available audio.\n\u2022 Count c(w, v), the number of times words w, v appear in the same bin.\n\u2022 The conditional ASR probability is computed as pc(v|w) = c(v, w)/ \u2211 v\u2032 c(v \u2032, w). \u2022 Prune words whose posterior probabilities are lower than 5% of the max probability in a bin.\n\u2022 Keep only the top 10 words in each bin.\nThe last two items above were implemented as a way of reducing the search space and the complexity of the task. We did not observe significant changes in the results when we relaxed these two constraints."}, {"heading": "4.1 Learning \u03bb with ASR Confusion Estimates", "text": "We now derive a maximum-likelihood estimate of \u03bb based on the 1-best ASR output but relies on the ASR channel confusion model pc. The loglikelihood of the observations (most likely path in the confusion network) is:\nL(2) = M\u2211 i=1 log p(w\u0302i), (14)\nwhere p is the induced distribution on the observations under the confusion model pc(v|w) and the estimated distribution q of (1):\np(w\u0302i) = \u2211 w\u2208V q(w)pc(w\u0302i|w). (15)\nRecall that while we sum over V , in practice the summation is limited to only likely words. One could argue that the ASR channel confusion distribution pc(w\u0302i|w) should discount unlikely confusions. However, since pc is not bin specific, unlikely words in a specific bin could receive non-negligible probability from pc if they are likely in general. This makes the truncated summation over V problematic.\nOne solution would be to reformulate pc(w\u0302i|w) so that it becomes a conditional distribution given the left (or even right) lexical context of the bin. But this formulation adds complexity and suffers from the usual sparsity issues. The solution we follow here imposes the constraint that only the words already\nexisting in bi are allowed to be candidate words giving rise to w\u0302i. This uses the \u201cpre-filtered\u201d set of words in bi to condition on context (acoustic and lexical), without having to model such context explicitly. We anticipate that this conditioning on the words of bi leads to more accurate inference. The likelihood objective then becomes:\nL\u2032(2) = M\u2211 i=1 log pi(w\u0302i), (16)\nwith pi defined as: pi(w\u0302i) = \u2211 w\u2208bi q(w)\u2211 w\u2032\u2208bi q(w \u2032) pc(w\u0302i|w), (17)\ni.e., the induced probability conditioned on bin bi. Note that although we estimate a conversation level distribution q(w), it has to be normalized in each bin by dividing by \u2211 w\u2208bi q(w), in order to condition only on the words in the bin. The maximumlikelihood estimation for \u03bb becomes:\n\u03bb\u2217 = argmax \u03bb L\u2032(2) = argmax \u03bb M\u2211 i=1 log pi(w\u0302i)\n= argmax \u03bb M\u2211 i=1 log \u2211 w\u2208bi \u2211 t \u03bbtq(w|t)pc(w\u0302i|w)\u2211 w\u2032\u2208bi \u2211 t\u2032 \u03bbt\u2032q(w \u2032|t\u2032)  (18)\nNote that the appearance of \u03bbt in the denominator makes the maximization harder.\nAs before, we rely on an EM-procedure to maximize this objective. Let us assume that at the j-th iteration of EM we have an estimate of the prior distribution q, denoted by q(j). This induces an observation probability in bin i based on equation (17), as well as a posterior probability r(j)i (w|w\u0302i) that a word w \u2208 bi is the reference word, given w\u0302i. The goal is to come up with a new estimate of the prior distribution q(j+1) that increases the value of the loglikelihood. If we define:\nQ(q(j), q\u2032) =\n= M\u2211 i=1 \u2211 w\u2208bi r (j) i (w|w\u0302i) log(pc(w\u0302i|w)q \u2032 i(w))\n= M\u2211 i=1 \u2211 w\u2208bi r (j) i (w|w\u0302i) log\n( pc(w\u0302i|w)q\u2032(w)\u2211\nw\u2032\u2208bi q \u2032(w\u2032) ) (19)\nthen we have:\nL\u2032(2)(q(j), q\u2032)\u2212 L\u2032(2)(q(j), q(j)) = Q(q(j), q\u2032)\u2212Q(q(j), q(j))\n+ M\u2211 i=1 D(r (j) i (\u00b7|w\u0302i)\u2016r \u2032 i(\u00b7|w\u0302i))\n\u2265 Q(q(j), q\u2032)\u2212Q(q(j), q(j)) , (20)\nwhere (20) holds because D(r(j)i (\u00b7|w\u0302i)\u2016r\u2032i(\u00b7|w\u0302i)) \u2265 0 (Cover and Thomas, 1996). Thus, we just need to find the value of q\u2032 that maximizes Q(q(j), q\u2032), as this will guarantee that L\u2032(2)(q(j), q\u2032) \u2265 L\u2032(2)(q(j), q(j)). The distribution q\u2032 can be written:\nq\u2032(w) = \u2211 t \u03bbtq(w|t). (21)\nThus, Q, as a function of \u03bb, can be written as:\nQ(q(j),\u03bb) = M\u2211 i=1 \u2211 w\u2208bi r (j) i (w|w\u0302i) log ( pc(w\u0302i|w) \u2211 t \u03bbtq(w|t)\u2211 w\u2032\u2208bi \u2211 t \u03bbtq(w \u2032|t) ) .\n(22)\nEquation (22) cannot be easily maximized with respect to \u03bb by simple differentiation, because the elements of \u03bb appear in the denominator, making them coupled. Instead, we will derive and maximize a lower bound for the Q-difference (20).\nFor the rest of the derivation we assume that \u03bbt = e\u00b5t\u2211 t\u2032 e\n\u00b5t\u2032 , where \u00b5t \u2208 R. We can thus express Q as a function of \u00b5 = (\u00b51, . . . , \u00b5T ) as follows:\nQ(q(j),\u00b5) = M\u2211 i=1 \u2211 w\u2208bi r (j) i (w|w\u0302i) log ( pc(w\u0302i|w) \u2211 t e\u00b5t\u2211 t\u2032 e \u00b5t\u2032 q(w|t)\u2211 w\u2032\u2208bi \u2211 t e\u00b5t\u2211 t\u2032 e \u00b5t\u2032 q(w \u2032|t) )\n= M\u2211 i=1 \u2211 w\u2208bi r (j) i (w|w\u0302i) log\n( pc(w\u0302i|w) \u2211 t e \u00b5tq(w|t)\u2211\nw\u2032\u2208bi \u2211 t e \u00b5tq(w\u2032|t) ) (23)\nInterestingly, the fact that the sum \u2211\nt e \u00b5t appears\nin both numerator and denominator in the above expression allows us to discard it.\nAt iteration j + 1, the goal is to come up with an update \u03b4, such that \u00b5(j)+\u03b4 results in a higher value for Q; i.e., we require:\nQ(q(j),\u00b5(j) + \u03b4) \u2265 Q(q(j),\u00b5(j)), (24)\nwhere \u00b5(j) is the weight vector that resulted after optimizing Q in the j-th iteration. Obviously,\nq(j)(w) = \u2211 t e\u00b5 (j) t q(w|t)\u2211 t\u2032 e \u00b5 (j) t\u2032 .

We estimate the topic distributions \u03bbC for a conversation C by either selftraining directly on the ASR output, or including our ASR channel confusion model. For training on the ASR output, we rely on MLE 1-best training ((5),(6), left figure), or expected counts from the lattices (10). For both settings we also consider MAP estimation: 1-best (12) and expected counts (13). When using the ASR channel confusion model, we derived parallel cases for MLE 1-best ((32), middle figure) and expected counts (36), as well as the MAP (right figure) training of each ((41),(42))."}, {"heading": "5 Experimental Results", "text": "We compare self-training, as described in Section 3, with our confusion approach, as described in Section 4, on topic-based language model adaptation.\nSetup Speech data is taken from the Fisher telephone conversation speech corpus, which has been split into 4 parts: set A1 is one hour of speech used for training the ASR system (acoustic modeling). We chose a small training set to simulate a high WER condition (approx. 56%) since we are primarily interested in low resource settings. While conversational speech is a challenging task even with many hours of training data, we are interested in settings with a tiny amount of training data, such as for new domains, languages or noise conditions. Set A2, a superset of A1, contains 5.5mil words of manual transcripts, used for training the topic-based distribution q(\u00b7|t). Conversations in the Fisher corpus are labeled with 40 topics so we create 40 topic-based unigram distributions. These are smoothed based on the vocabulary of the recognizer using the WittenBell algorithm (Chen and Goodman, 1996). Set B, which consists of 50 hours and is disjoint from the other sets, is used as a development corpus for tuning the MAP parameter \u03b2(\u03b1\u2212 1). Finally, set C (44 hours) is used as a blind test set. The ASR channel and the topic proportions \u03bb are learned in an unsupervised manner on both sets B and C. The results are reported on approximately 5-hour subsets of sets B and C, consisting of 35 conversations each.\nBBN\u2019s ASR system, Byblos, was used in all ASR experiments. It is a multi-pass LVCSR system that uses state-clustered Gaussian tied-mixture models at the triphone and quinphone levels (Prasad et al., 2005). The audio features are transformed using cepstral normalization, HLDA and VTLN. Only ML estimation was used. Decoding performs three passes: a forward and backward pass with a triphone acoustic model (AM) and a 3-gram language model (LM), and rescoring using quinphone AM and a 4-gram LM. These three steps are repeated after speaker adaptation using CMLLR. The vocabulary of the recognizer is 75k words. References of the dev and test sets have vocabularies of 13k and 11k respectively.\nContent Words Our focus on estimating confusions suggests that improvements would be manifest for content words, as opposed to frequently occurring function words. This would be a highly desirable improvement as more accurate content words lead to improved readability or performance on downstream tasks, such as information retrieval and spoken term detection. As a result, we care more about reducing perplexity on these content words than reducing overall scores, which give too much emphasis to function words, the most frequent tokens in the reference transcriptions.\nTo measure content word (low-frequency words) improvements we use the method of Wu and Khudanpur (2000), who compute a constrained version of perplexity focused on content words. We restrict the computation to only those words whose counts in the reference transcripts are at most equal to a threshold thr. Perplexity (Jelinek, 1997) is measured on the manual transcripts of both dev and test data based on the formula PPL(p) , 10 \u2212 1|C| \u2211|C| i=1 log10(p(wi)), where p represents the estimated language model, and |C| is the size of the (dev or test) corpus. We emphasize that constrained perplexity is not an evaluation metric, and directly optimizing it would foolishly hurt overall perplexity. However, if overall perplexity remains unchanged, then improvements in content word perplexity reflect a shift of the probability mass, emphasizing corrections in content words over the accuracy of function words, a sensible choice for improving output quality.\nResults First we observe that overall perplexity (far right of Figure 2) remains unchanged; none of the differences between models with and without confusion estimates are statistically significant. However, as expected, the confusion estimates significantly improves the performance on content words (left and center of Figure 2.) The confusion model gives modest (4-6% relative) but statistically significant (p < 2 \u00b7 10\u22122) gains in all conditions for content (low-frequency) word. Additionally, the MAP variant (which was tuned based on low-frequency words) gives gains over the MLE version in all conditions, for both the self-supervised and the confusion model cases. This indicates that modeling confusions focuses improvements on content words, which improve readability and downstream applications.\nASR Improvements Finally, we consider how our adapted language models can improve WER of the ASR system. We used each of the language models with the recognizer to produce transcripts of the dev and test sets. Overall, the best language model (including the confusion model) yielded no change in the overall WER (as we observed with perplexity). However, in a rescoring experiment, the adapted model with confusion estimates resulted in a 0.3% improvement in content WER (errors restricted to words that appear at most 3 times) over the unadapted model, and a 0.1% improvement over the regular adapted model. This confirms that our improved language models yield better recognition output, focused on improvements in content words."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We have presented a new model that captures the confusions (errors) of the ASR channel. When incorporated with adaptation of a topic-based language model, we observe improvements in modeling of content words that improve readability and downstream applications. Our improvements are consistent across a number of settings, including 1-best and lattice self-training on conversational speech. Beyond improvements to language modeling, we believe that our confusion model can aid other speech tasks, such as topic classification. We plan to investigate other tasks, as well as better confusion models, in future work."}], "references": [{"title": "Unsupervised language model adaptation", "author": ["Bacchiani", "Roark2003] M.

Language models, which play a crucial role in speech recognizers and machine translation systems, are particularly sensitive to such changes, unless some form of adaptation takes place. One approach to speech language model adaptation is self-training, in which a language model\u2019s parameters are tuned based on automatically transcribed audio. However, transcription errors can misguide self-training, particularly in challenging settings such as conversational speech. In this work, we propose a model that considers the confusions (errors) of the ASR channel. By modeling the likely confusions in the ASR output instead of using just the 1-best, we improve self-training efficacy by obtaining a more reliable reference transcription estimate. We demonstrate improved topic-based language modeling adaptation results over both 1-best and lattice selftraining using our ASR channel confusion estimates on telephone conversations.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
