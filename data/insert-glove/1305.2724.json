INTRODUCTION", "text": "In Many complicated problems like, engineering problems, social, economic, computer science, medical science\u2026etc, the data associated are not necessarily crisp, precise, and deterministic because of their vague nature. Most of these problem were solved by different theories. One of these theories was the fuzzy set theory discovered by Lotfi, Zadeh in 1965 [1], Later several researches present a number of results using different direction of fuzzy set such as: interval fuzzy set [12], generalized fuzzy set by Atanassov [2]..., all these are successful to some extent in dealing with the problems arising due to the vagueness present in the real world ,but there are also cases where these theories failed to give satisfactory results, possibly due to indeterminate and inconsistent information which exist in belief system, then in 1995, Smarandache [3] initiated the theory of neutrosophic set as new mathematical tool for handling problems involving imprecise, indeterminacy, and inconsistent data. Several researchers dealing with the concept of neutrosophic set such as M. Bhowmik and M.Pal in [13], A.A.Salama in [7], and H.Wang in [14]. Furthermore, In 1999, a Russian mathematician (Molodtsov [4]) introduce a new mathematical tool for dealing with uncertainties, called \u201csoft set theory\u201d. This new concept is free from the limitation of variety of theories such as probability theory, Fuzzy sets and rough sets. Soft set theory has no problem of setting the membership function, which makes it very convenient and easy to apply in practice. After Molodtsov\u2019work, there have been many researches in combining fuzzy set with soft set, which incorporates the beneficial properties of both fuzzy set and soft set techniques ( see [11] [6] [8]). So in this paper we present a new model which combine two concepts: Generalized neutrosophic set proposed by A.A.Salama [7] and soft set proposed by Molodtsov in [4], together by introducing a new concept called generalized neutrosophic sof set, thus we introduce its operations namely equal, subset, union, and intersection, Finally we present an application of generalized neutrosophic soft set in decision making problem.\nInternational Journal of Computer Science, Engineering and Information Technology (IJCSEIT), Vol.3, No.2,April2013\nThe content of the paper is orgonaized as follow: In section 2, we briefly present some basic definitions and preliminary results are given which will be used in the rest of the paper.

The definitions in this part may be found in references [3, 4, 7, 10].\nThroughout this paper, let U be a universal set and E be the set of all possible parameters under consideration with respect to U, usually, parameters are attributes, characteristics, or properties of objects in U.\nDefinition 2.1 (see [3]). Neutrosophic Set\nLet U be an universe of discourse then the neutrosophic set A is an object having the form A = {< x: TA(x),I A(x),FA(x) >,x \u2208 U}, where the functions T,I,F : U\u2192]\u22120,1\n+[ define respectively the degree of membership , the degree of indeterminacy, and the degree of non-membership of the element x\u2208 X to the set A with the condition.\n\u22120\u2264 TA(x) + IA(x) + FA(x)\u2264 3 +.\nFrom philosophical point of view, the neutrosophic set takes the value from real standard or non-standard subsets of ]\u22120,1+[. So instead of ]\u22120,1+[ we need to take the interval [0,1] for technical applications, because ]\u22120,1+[ will be difficult to apply in the real applications such as in scientific and engineering problems.\nDefinition 2.2. (see [10])\nA neutrosophic set A is contained in another neutrosophic set B i.e. A \u2286 B if \u2200x \u2208 U, TA(x) \u2264 TB(x), IA(x) \u2265 IB(x), FA(x) \u2265 FB(x).\nDefinition 2.3(see [7]). Generalized Neutrosophic Set\nLet X be a non-empty fixed set. A generalized neutrosophic set (GNS for short) A is an object having the form A = {< x: TA(x), IA(x), FA(x) >,x \u2208 U}, Where TA(x), represent the degree of membership function , IA(x) represent the degree of indeterminacy, and FA(x) represent the degree of non-member ship respectively of each element x\u2208 X to the set A where the functions satisfy the condition:\nTA( x )\u2227 FA( x )\u2227 IA( x ) \u2264 0.5 As an illustration, let us consider the following example.\nExample2.4. Assume that the universe of discourse U={x1,x2,x3},where x1 characterizes the capability, x2 characterizes the trustworthiness and x3 indicates the prices of the objects. It may be further assumed that the values of x1, x2 and x3 are in [0, 1] and they are obtained from some questionnaires of some experts. The experts may impose their opinion in three components viz.\nInternational Journal of Computer Science, Engineering and Information Technology (IJCSEIT), Vol.3, No.2,April2013\nthe degree of goodness, the degree of indeterminacy and that of poorness to explain the characteristicsof the objects. Suppose A is an generalized neutrosophic set ( GNS ) of U, such that, A = {< x1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.4 >,< x2,0.4, 0.2, 0.6 >,< x3, 0.7, 0.3, 0.5 >}, where the degree of goodness of capability is 0.3, degree of indeterminacy of capability is 0.5 and degree of falsity of capability is 0.4 etc.\nDefinition 2.5 (see[4]). Soft Set\nLet U be an initial universe set and E be a set of parameters. Let P(U) denotes the power set of U. Consider a nonempty set A, A \u2282 E A pair ( F, A ) is called a soft set over U, where F is a mapping given by F : A\u2192 P(U). As an illustration , let us consider the following example.\nExample 2.6. Suppose that U is the set of houses under consideration, say U = {h1, h2, . . ., h5}. Let E be the set of some attributes of such houses, say E = {e1, e2, . . ., e8}, where e1, e2, . . ., e8 stand for the attributes \u201cexpensive\u201d, \u201cbeautiful\u201d, \u201cwooden\u201d, \u201ccheap\u201d, \u201cmodern\u201d, and \u201cin bad repair\u201d, respectively.\nIn this case, to define a soft set means to point out expensive houses, beautiful houses, and so on. For example, the soft set (F, A) that describes the \u201cattractiveness of the houses\u201d in the opinion of a buyer, say Thomas, may be defined like this:\nA={e1, e2, e3, e4, e5}; F(e1) = {h2, h3, h5}, F(e2) = {h2, h4}, F(e3) = {h1}, F(e4) = U, F(e5) = {h3, h5}.\nFor more details on the algebra and operations on generalized neutrosophic set and soft set, the reader may refer to [ 5, 6, 8 , 7, 9, 11]."}, {"heading": "3.

In this case, to define a generalized neutrosophic soft set means to point out\nInternational Journal of Computer Science, Engineering and Information Technology (IJCSEIT), Vol.3, No.2,April2013\nBright blouses, Cheap blouses, Blouses in Cotton and so on. Suppose that, there are five blouses in the universe U given by, U = {b1, b2, b3, b4, b5} and the set of parameters A = {e1, e2, e3, e4}, where each ei is a specific criterion for blouses:\ne1 stands for \u2018Bright\u2019, e2 stands for \u2018Cheap\u2019,\ne3 stands for \u2018costly\u2019, e4 stands for \u2018Colorful\u2019,\nSuppose that,\nF(Bright)={<b1, 0.5, 0.6, 0.3>,<b2,0.4, 0.7, 0.2>,<b3,0.6, 0.2, 0.3>,<b4, 0.7, 0.3, 0.2> ,<b5,0.8, 0.2, 0.3>}.

The mapping F here is \u2018blouses (.)\u2019, where dot(.) is to be filled up by a parameter ei\u2208 E. Therefore, F(e1) means \u2018blouses (Bright)\u2019 whose functional-value is the generalized neutrosophic set {< b1, 0.5, 0.6, 0.3 >,< b2, 0.4, 0.7, 0.2 >, < b3, 0.6, 0.2, 0.3 >,< b4, 0.7, 0.3, 0.2 >,< b5, 0.8, 0.2, 0.3 >}.\nThus we can view the generalized neutrosophic soft set ( GNSS) (F,A) as a collection of approximation as below:\n( F, A ) = { Bright blouses= {< b1, 0.5, 0.6, 0.3 >,< b2, 0.4, 0.7, 0.2 >, < b3, 0.6, 0.2, 0.3 >,< b4,0.7,0.3,0.2 >,< b5,0.8,0.2,0.3 >}, Cheap blouses= {< b1,0.6,0.3,0.5 >,< b2,0.7,0.4,0.3 >,< b3,0.8,0.1,0.2 >, < b4, 0.7,0.1,0.3 >,< b5, 0.8,0.3,0.4 >}, costly blouses= {< b1,0.7,0.4,0.3 > ,< b2, 0.6, 0.1, 0.2 >,< b3, 0.7, 0.2, 0.5 >,< b4, 0.5,0.2,0.6 >,< b5, 0.7, 0.3, 0.2 >}, Colorful blouses= {< b1, 0.8, 0.1,0.4 >,< b2, 0.4, 0.2,0.6 >,< b3, 0.3, 0.6,0.4 >, < b4, 0.4, 0.8, 0.5>,< b5, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 >}}. where each approximation has two parts: (i) a predicate p, and (ii) an approximate value-set v ( or simply to be called value-set v ).\nFor example, for the approximation \u2018Bright blouses={<b1,0.5,0.6,0.3>,<b2,0.4,0.7,0.2 >,<b3,0.6,0.2,0.3>,<b4,0.7,0.3,0.2>,<b5,0.8,0.2,0.3>}\u2019.\nWe have (i) the predicate name \u2018Bright blouses\u2019, and (ii) the approximate value-set is{<b1,0.5,0.6,0.3>,<b2,0.4,0.7,0.2>,<b3,0.6,0.2,0.3>,<b4,0.7,0.3,0.2> ,< b5,0.8,0.2,0.3 >}. Thus, an generalized neutrosophic soft set ( F, E ) can be viewed as a collection of approximation like ( F, E ) = {p1 = v1,p2 = v2,\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,p10 = v10}. In order to store a generalized neutrosophic soft set in a computer, we could represent it in the form of a table as shown below ( corresponding to the generalized neutrosophic soft set in the above example ). In this table, the entries are cij corresponding to the blouse bi and the parameter ej, where cij = (true-membership value of bi, indeterminacy-membership value of bi, falsity membership value of bi) in F(ej).

We also assume that corresponding to the parameter ej (j =1,2,\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7 ,m) the performance value of the blouse bi (i = 1, 2,\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 , n) is a tuple pij = (T F(ej) (bi),I F(ej) (bi),T F(ej) (bi)), such that for a fixed i that values pij (j = 1, 2,\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,m) represents a generalized neutrosophic soft set of all the n objects. Thus the performance values could be arranged in the form of a matrix called the \u2018criteria matrix\u2019. The more are the criteria values, the more preferability of the corresponding object is. Our problem is to select the most suitable object i.e. The object which dominates each of the objects of the spectrum of the parameters ej. Since the data are not crisp but generalized neutrosophic soft the selection is not straightforward. Our aim is to find out the most suitable blouse with the choice parameters for Mrs. X. The blouse which is suitable for Mrs. X need not be suitable for Mrs. Y or Mrs. Z, as the selection is dependent on the choice parameters of each buyer. We use the technique to calculate the score for the objects."}, {"heading": "4.1. Definition: Comparison matrix.", "text": "The Comparison matrix is a matrix whose rows are labeled by the object names of the universe such as b1, b2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , bn and the columns are labeled by the parameters e1,e2,\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , em. The entries are cij, where cij, is the number of parameters for which the value of bi exceeds or is equal to the value bj. The entries are calculated by cij = a + d - c, where \u2018a\u2019 is the integer calculated as \u2018how\nInternational Journal of Computer Science, Engineering and Information Technology (IJCSEIT), Vol.3, No.2,April2013\nmany times Tbi (ej) exceeds or equal to Tbk (ej)\u2019, for bi \u2260 bk, \u2200 bk \u2208 U, \u2018d\u2019 is the integer calculated as \u2018how many times Ibi(ej) exceeds or equal to Ibk(ej)\u2019, for bi \u2260 bk, \u2200 bk \u2208 U and \u2018c\u2019 is the integer \u2018how many times Fbi(ej) exceeds or equal to Fbk(ej)\u2019, for bi \u2260 bk, \u2200 bk \u2208 U.

Algorithm (1) input the generalized neutrosophic Soft Set ( F, A). (2) input P, the choice parameters of Mrs. X which is a subset of A. (3) consider the GNSS ( F, P) and write it in tabular form. (4) compute the comparison matrix of the GNSS ( F, P). (5) compute the score Si of bi, \u2200i. (6) find Sk = maxi Si (7) if k has more than one value then any one of bi may be chosen. To illustrate the basic idea of the algorithm, now we apply it to the generalized neutrosophic soft set based decision making problem. Suppose the wishing parameters for Mrs. X where P={ Cheap, Colorful, Polystyreneing, costly , Bright }.\nConsider the GNSS ( F, P ) presented into the following table.\nThe comparison-matrix of the above GNSS ( F, P) is represented as follow:\nInternational Journal of Computer Science, Engineering and Information Technology (IJCSEIT), Vol.3, No.2,April2013\nNext we compute the score for each bi as shown below:\nU Score (Si) b1 3 b2 2 b3 11 b4 19 b5 17\nClearly, the maximum score is the score 19, shown in the table above for the blouse b4. Hence the best decision for Mrs. X is to select b4, followed by b5 ."}, {"heading": "5.
