Introduction", "text": "Studies on the intertranslatability of different approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning have always been considered as an important contribution to the field in order to understand the expressibility and representation capacity of the various formalisms. By intertranslatability we understand a function Tr which maps theories from one formalism into another such that intended models of a theory \u2206 from the source formalism are in a certain relation to the intended models of Tr (\u2206). Several desired properties for such translation functions have been identified, including to be polynomial (Tr (\u2206) can be computed in polynomial time wrt. the size of \u2206) or to be modular (roughly speaking, that allows to transform parts of the theory independently of each other). In particular, the relationship between (variants of) default logic (Reiter, 1980) and nonmonotonic modal logics, e.g. autoepistemic logic (Moore, 1985), has always received a lot of attention, (see, e.g., Denecker, Marek, & Truszczyn\u0301ski, 2003; Konolige, 1988; Marek & Truszczyn\u0301ski, 1993). Perhaps most notably, Gottlob (1995) showed that a modular translation from default logic to autoepistemic logic is impossible. Other important contributions in this direction include translations between default logic and circumscription (Imielinski, 1987), modal nonmonotonic logics and logic programs (see, e.g., de Bruijn, Eiter, & Tompits, 2008 for an overview and recent applications) and the work by Janhunen (1999). Let us also refer here to recent work by Pearce and Uridia (2011), who show that translations of the aforementioned kind have already been known in the context of non-classical logics and related results date back to the work of Go\u0308del.\nIn this work, we study translation functions within a particular formalism of nonmonotonic reasoning but wrt. to different semantics proposed for this formalism. In the area of default logic, similar research was undertaken, for instance by Liberatore (2007) or Delgrande and Schaub (2005). Likewise, for work concerning the relationship between different logic programming semantics we refer to the work of Janhunen, Niemela\u0308, Seipel, Simons,\nc\u00a92011 AI Access Foundation.

The formalism we focus on in this paper are Dung\u2019s argumentation frameworks (Dung, 1995) which received increasing interest within the last decade. In a nutshell, such argumentation frameworks (AFs, for short) represent abstract statements1 together with a relation denoting attacks between them. Different semantics provide different ways to solve the inherent conflicts between statements by selecting acceptable subsets \u2014 usually called extensions \u2014 of them. Several such semantics have already been proposed by Dung in his seminal paper (Dung, 1995), but also alternative approaches play a major role nowadays (see, e.g., Baroni, Dunne, & Giacomin, 2011; Baroni, Giacomin, & Guida, 2005; Caminada, 2006; Dung, Mancarella, & Toni, 2007; Verheij, 1996). Compared to other nonmonotonic formalisms (which are built on top of classical logical syntax), argumentation frameworks are a much simpler formalism (in the end, they are just directed graphs). However, this simplicity made them an attractive modeling tool in several diverse areas, like formalizations of legal reasoning (Bench-Capon & Dunne, 2005) or multi-agent negotiation (Amgoud, Dimopoulos, & Moraitis, 2007).\nIn the field of argumentation, intertranslatability has mainly been studied in connection with generalizations of Dung\u2019s argumentation frameworks. By generalization we mean here the augmentation of simple frameworks by further concepts as priorities or additional relations between arguments. In this context, translations were used to show that proposed semantics for such generalizations are in a close relation with the corresponding semantics of standard AFs. In other words, given such a generalized AF one is interested in translating them to standard AFs while preserving semantics. Such translations have been discussed, for instance, in terms of bipolar AFs (Cayrol & Lagasquie-Schiex, 2009), valuebased AFs (Bench-Capon & Atkinson, 2009), AFs with recursive attacks (Baroni, Cerutti, Giacomin, & Guida, 2011), or abstract dialectical frameworks (Brewka, Dunne, & Woltran, 2011). A recent exception where intertranslatability within Dung AFs is discussed, is the work by Baumann and Brewka (2010), who consider to enforce a desired extension in Dung AFs by adding new arguments and switching semantics. From a slightly different perspective, also the work by Gabbay (2009) is related, since it investigates the substitution of an argumentation framework as a node in another framework.\nWe focus here exclusively on standard argumentation frameworks and have the following main objective: Given an AF F and argumentation semantics \u03c3 and \u03c3\u2032, find a function Tr such that the \u03c3-extensions of F are in certain correspondence to the \u03c3\u2032-extensions of Tr (F ). We believe that such results are important from different points of view.\nFirstly, consider there is an advanced argumentation engine for a semantics \u03c3\u2032, but one wants to evaluate an AF F wrt. to a different semantics \u03c3. Then, it might be a good plan to transform F in such a way into an AF F \u2032 such that evaluating F \u2032 wrt. semantics \u03c3\u2032 allows for an easy reconstruction of the \u03c3-extensions of F . If the required transformations are efficiently computable, this leads to a potentially more successful approach than implementing a distinguished algorithm for the \u03c3-semantics from scratch. Figure 1 illustrates this idea. The concept of a filter is required in case Tr (F ) introduces further arguments (which thus might appear in the \u03c3\u2032-extensions of Tr (F )) in the course of the translation making a filter-\n1. In general, arguments are not considered as simple statements but contain a number of reasons that lead to a conclusion (see, e.g., Besnard & Hunter, 2001; Caminada & Amgoud, 2007). However, for the purpose of this work, we will treat arguments as atomic entities thus abstracting from their internal structure.\ning of these new arguments necessary to obtain the desired original extensions. However, we will also consider translations for which such a back-translation is not necessary.\nA second motivation of our work is concerned with meta(level) argumentation (see, e.g., Modgil & Bench-Capon, 2011; Villata, 2010) which can be explained as follows: \u201cA meta-level Dung argumentation framework is itself instantiated by arguments that make statements about arguments, their interactions, and their evaluation in an object-level argumentation framework\u201d(Modgil & Bench-Capon, 2011). The translations we shall present here exactly fit into this picture in the sense that we have to model certain features of a semantics \u03c3 within another semantics \u03c3\u2032, when giving a translation from \u03c3 to \u03c3\u2032. To have a more concrete example, let \u03c3\u2032 be the complete semantics and \u03c3 denote stable semantics (we will provide the formal details about the different semantics in Section 2; for the sake of this illustration the details are not required). Then, the transformation has to capture the concept of admissibility (informally speaking, a set of arguments has to defend itself) which is implicitly present in complete semantics by a suitable introduction of new arguments, such that stable semantics can perform such a type of reasoning. In other words, translatability results between different semantics of AFs yield an understanding of how certain properties, which are specified implicitly within one semantics, can be made (syntactically) explicit within an AF in order to make these properties amenable to another semantics.\nAs a third important application of our work, we consider situations where different semantics of argumentation have to be dealt with simultaneously. This might be the case if different agents share their views about a certain situation (modeled as AFs) but these agents use different semantics to reason over their frameworks. As well, the problem of combining frameworks which have been constructed under the assumption that they will be evaluated under different semantics falls into a possible application area of our work.\nFinally, we emphasize that understanding which translations can be efficiently performed wrt. different semantics complements the picture about expressibility of argumentation semantics. For instance, if there exists an efficient translation from semantics \u03c3 to semantics \u03c3\u2032, but there is no such translation in the other direction, \u03c3 could be understood as more expressible than \u03c3\u2032, although complexity analysis for typical decision problems associated to AFs does not show any difference between \u03c3 and \u03c3\u2032. As an example consider semi-stable and stage semantics. For both semantics the credulous acceptance problem is \u03a3P2 -complete and the skeptical acceptance problem is \u03a0P2 -complete (Dvor\u030ca\u0301k & Woltran, 2010). But when considering what we call efficient exact translations one can map stage semantics to semistable semantics but not vice versa. Thus semi-stable semantics are more expressible than stage semantics wrt. efficient exact translations. However we will argue that the notion of exact translations may be too restrictive for comparing the expressibility of argumentation semantics.\nBeside these aspects of motivation, we would like to mention that positive results on intertranslations indicate a certain form of independence of semantics in argumentation. This is of particular importance, having in mind that the argumentation community nowadays is overwhelmed with different proposals of semantics. Thus understanding the basic principles underlying different semantics is crucial, and we believe the results provided in this paper contribute to this question.\nThe organization of the remainder of the paper and its main contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 In Section 2, we introduce argumentation frameworks and the different semantics we deal with in this paper. We also review known complexity results which we complement in the sense that we show some of the known tractable problems to be P -hard; a fact we will use for some impossibility results in Section 5.\n\u2022 Section 3 defines properties for translations basically along the lines of Janhunen (1999). In particular, we consider here as desired properties efficiency (the translation can be computed in logarithmic space wrt. the given AF), modularity (the translation can be done independently for certain parts of the framework) and faithfulness (there should be a clear correspondence between the extensions of the translated AF and the original AF). However, we also consider some additional features which are needed to deal with some of the argumentation semantics (for instance, the admissible semantics always yields the empty set as one solution; thus filtering such an entire solution is necessary).\n\u2022 Section 4 contains our main results, in particular we provide translations between Dung\u2019s original semantics (admissible, preferred, stable, complete, grounded), stage semantics (Verheij, 1996) and semi-stable semantics (Caminada, 2006). We analyze these translations wrt. the properties mentioned above using as minimal desiderata efficiency and (a particular form of) faithfulness.\n\u2022 As already mentioned, Section 5 then provides negative results, i.e. we show that certain translations between semantics are not possible. Some of these impossibility results make use of typical complexity-theoretic assumptions; others are genuine due to the different properties of the compared semantics.\n\u2022 Finally, in Section 6 we conclude the paper with a summary and discussion of the presented results. As well, an outlook to potential future work is given there."}, {"heading": "2. Argumentation Frameworks", "text": "In this section we introduce (abstract) argumentation frameworks (Dung, 1995) and recall the semantics we study in this paper (see also Baroni & Giacomin, 2009, for an overview). Moreover, we highlight and complement complexity results for typical decision problems associated to such frameworks.\nDefinition 1. An argumentation framework (AF) is a pair F = (A, R) where A is a nonempty set of arguments 2 and R \u2286 A\u00d7A is the attack relation. For a given AF F = (A, R)\n2. For technical reasons we only consider AFs with A 6= \u2205.\nwe use AF to denote the set A of its arguments and RF to denote its attack relation R. The pair (a, b) \u2208 R means that a attacks b.\nWe sometimes use the notation a R b instead of (a, b) \u2208 R. For S \u2286 A and a \u2208 A, we also write S R a (resp. a R S) in case there exists an argument b \u2208 S, such that b R a (resp. a R b). In case no ambiguity arises, we use  instead of R.\nAn AF can naturally be represented as a directed graph. Semantics for argumentation frameworks are given via a function \u03c3 which assigns to each AF F = (A, R) a set \u03c3(F ) \u2286 2A of extensions. We shall consider here for \u03c3 the functions stb, adm, prf , com, grd , stg , and sem which stand for stable, admissible, preferred, complete, grounded, stage, and respectively, semi-stable semantics. Before giving the actual definitions for these semantics, we require a few more formal concepts.\nDefinition 2. Given an AF F = (A, R), an argument a \u2208 A is defended (in F ) by a set S \u2286 A if for each b \u2208 A, such that b  a, also S  b holds. Moreover, for a set S \u2286 A, we define the range of S, denoted as S+R , as the set S \u222a {b | S  b}.\nWe continue with the definitions of the considered semantics. Observe that their common feature is the concept of conflict-freeness, i.e. arguments in an extension are not allowed to attack each other.\nDefinition 3. Let F = (A, R) be an AF. A set S \u2286 A is conflict-free (in F ), if there are no a, b \u2208 S, such that (a, b) \u2208 R. For such a conflict-free set S, it holds that\n\u2022 S \u2208 stb(F ), if for each a \u2208 A \\ S, S  a, i.e. S+R = A;\n\u2022 S \u2208 adm(F ), if each a \u2208 S is defended by S;\n\u2022 S \u2208 prf (F ), if S \u2208 adm(F ) and there is no T \u2208 adm(F ) with T \u2283 S;\n\u2022 S \u2208 com(F ), if S \u2208 adm(F ) and for each a \u2208 A that is defended by S, a \u2208 S;\n\u2022 S \u2208 grd(F ), if S \u2208 com(F ) and there is no T \u2208 com(F ) with T \u2282 S;\n\u2022 S \u2208 stg(F ), if there is no conflict-free set T in F , such that T+R \u2283 S + R ;\n\u2022 S \u2208 sem(F ), if S \u2208 adm(F ) and there is no T \u2208 adm(F ) with T+R \u2283 S + R .\nFor all semantics \u03c3, the sets defined above are the only ones in \u03c3(F ).\nWe recall that for each AF F ,\nstb(F ) \u2286 sem(F ) \u2286 prf (F ) \u2286 com(F ) \u2286 adm(F )\nholds, and that for each of the considered semantics \u03c3 except stable semantics, \u03c3(F ) 6= \u2205 holds. The grounded semantics always yields exactly one extension. Moreover if an AF has at least one stable extension then its stable, semi-stable, and stage extensions coincide.\nExample 1. Consider the AF F = (A, R), with A = {a, b, c, d, e} and R = {(a, b), (c, b), (c, d), (d, c), (d, e), (e, e)}. The graph representation of F is given as follows.\na b c d e\nWe have stb(F ) = stg(F ) = sem(F ) = {{a, d}}. Further we have as admissible sets of F the collection {}, {a}, {c}, {d}, {a, c}, {a, d}, thus prf (F ) = {{a, c},{a, d}}. Finally the complete extensions of F are {a}, {a, c} and {a, d}, with {a} being the grounded extension of F . \u2666\nWe now turn to the complexity of reasoning in AFs. To this end, we define the following decision problems for the semantics \u03c3 introduced in Definition 3.\n\u2022 Credulous Acceptance Cred\u03c3: Given AF F = (A, R) and an argument a \u2208 A. Is a contained in some S \u2208 \u03c3(F )?\n\u2022 Skeptical Acceptance Skept\u03c3: Given AF F = (A, R) and an argument a \u2208 A. Is a contained in each S \u2208 \u03c3(F )?\n\u2022 Verification of an extension Ver\u03c3: Given AF F = (A, R) and a set of arguments S \u2286 A. Is S \u2208 \u03c3(F )?\n\u2022 Existence of an extension Exists\u03c3: Given AF F = (A, R). Is \u03c3(F ) 6= \u2205?\n\u2022 Existence of a nonempty extension Exists\u00ac\u2205\u03c3 : Given AF F = (A, R). Does there exist a set S 6= \u2205 such that S \u2208 \u03c3(F )?\nBefore giving an overview about known results, we provide a few lower bounds which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been established yet.\nProposition 1. The problems Credgrd = Skeptgrd = Skeptcom as well as Vergrd are P-hard (under L-reductions, i.e. reductions using logarithmic space).\nProof. We use a reduction from the P-hard problem to decide, given a propositional definite Horn theory T and an atom x, whether x is true in the minimal model of T .\nLet, for a definite Horn theory T = {rl : bl,1 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 bl,il \u2192 hl | 1 \u2264 l \u2264 n} over atoms X and an atom z \u2208 X, FT,z = (A, R) be an AF defined as follows:\nA = T \u222a X \u222a {t}\nR = {(x, x), (t, x) | x \u2208 X} \u222a {(z, t)} \u222a\n{(rl, hl), (bl,j , rl) | rl \u2208 T, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 il)}\nwhere t is a fresh argument. See Figure 2 for an example. Clearly the AF FT,z can be constructed using only logarithmic space in the size of T .\nIn the following we show that z is in the minimal model of T iff t is in the grounded extension of FT,z iff grd(FT,z) = {T \u222a {t}}.\nFirst we attend that t is in the grounded extension E of FT,z iff E = {T\u222a{t}}. Obviously the if-direction holds. Thus let us assume t \u2208 E, then each x \u2208 X is attacked by E and thus each r \u2208 T is defended by E. Hence E = {T \u222a {t}}.\nIt remains to show that z is in the minimal model of T iff t is in the grounded extension E of FT,z. We recall the definition of the characteristic function FF of an AF F , defined as FF (S) = {x \u2208 AF | x is defended by S}, and that the grounded extension of F is the least fix-point of FF . To show the only-if part, let us assume that z is in the minimal model of T . Thus there exists a finite sequence of rules (rli)1\u2264i\u2264k, such that (i) for each rule rli and each atom bli,s there exists a rule rlj , j < i with hlj = bli,s and (ii) hlk = z. Clearly rl1 has empty body and thus the corresponding argument has no attackers in FT,z, i.e. rl1 \u2208 E. We now claim that for each i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, rli \u2208 E holds as well and prove this by induction. To this end, we assume the claim holds for all m < i, i.e. rlm \u2208 E, and thus E  hlm for m < i holds. Using (i) we get that for each argument a \u2208 A with a  rli , it holds that E  a. Hence rli \u2208 E. Now in particular rlk \u2208 E and by (ii) we have that E  z. As z is the only argument attacking t we also have that t \u2208 E.\nTo show the if-part, let us assume that t is contained in the grounded extensions E of FT,z. Then by construction E  z and thus there exists an integer k, such that F k F (\u2205)  z and for each m < k : FmF (\u2205) 6 z. We claim that for 1 \u2264 m \u2264 k and x \u2208 X it holds that if FmF (\u2205)  x then x is in the minimal model of T . The proof is by induction on m. As induction base consider FF (\u2205). By construction FF (\u2205) is the set of arguments that correspond to rules in T having empty body. The arguments attacked by FF (\u2205) are the head atoms of these rules, which are clearly in the minimal model. For the induction step assume that Fm\u22121F (\u2205) only attacks arguments corresponding to atoms in the minimal model. As Fm\u22121F (\u2205) 6 z we have t 6\u2208 F m\u22121 F (\u2205). Let x \u2208 X be an argument such that F m F (\u2205)  x, but Fm\u22121F (\u2205) 6 z. Then there exists an ri \u2208 T such that hi = x and ri \u2208 F m F (\u2205). By construction of FT,z we have that the argument ri is defended by F m\u22121 F (\u2205) iff each atom in the body of ri is attacked by F m\u22121 F (\u2205). Hence, by assumption each atom in the body of ri is contained in the minimal model of T . But then the head hi of ri is in the minimal model of T . Hence, as FkF (\u2205)  z, we get that z is in the minimal model of T .\nProposition 2. Verstg is coNP-hard.\nProof. We prove the assertion by reducing the (NP-hard) problem 3-SAT to the complementary problem of Verstg . We assume that a 3-CNF formula is given as a set C of clauses, where each clause is a set over atoms and negated atoms (denoted by x\u0304). For such a CNF \u03d5 over variables X, define the AF F\u03d5 = (A, R) with\nA = X \u222a X\u0304 \u222a C \u222a {s, t, b}\nR = {(x, x\u0304), (x\u0304, x) | x \u2208 X} \u222a {(l, c) | l \u2208 c, c \u2208 C} \u222a\n{(c, t) | c \u2208 C} \u222a {(s, y), (y, s) | y \u2208 A \\ {s, b}} \u222a {(t, b), (b, b)}\nwhere X\u0304 = {x\u0304 | x \u2208 X} and s, t, b are fresh arguments. See Figure 3 for an illustrating example. We show that \u03d5 is satisfiable iff {s} is not a stage extension of F\u03d5. First let us assume \u03d5 is satisfiable and let T be any satisfying assignment of \u03d5. Then the set\nE = {t} \u222a {x | x \u2208 X, T (x) = true} \u222a {x\u0304 | x \u2208 X, T (x) = false} is a stable extension of F\u03d5, i.e. E + R = A, and since {s} + R = A \\ {b}, {s} is not a stage extension of F\u03d5. Now let us assume that {s} is a stage extension. By the same argumentation as above, i.e. using {s}+R \u2282 A, we get that F\u03d5 has no stable extension. But as we have seen before each satisfying assignment of \u03d5 corresponds to a stable extension of F\u03d5. Thus we can conclude that \u03d5 is unsatisfiable.\nTogether with results from the literature (Coste-Marquis, Devred, & Marquis, 2005; Dimopoulos & Torres, 1996; Dung, 1995; Dunne & Bench-Capon, 2002; Dunne & Caminada, 2008; Dvor\u030ca\u0301k & Woltran, 2010), we obtain the complexity-landscape of abstract argumentation as given in Table 1."}, {"heading": "3. Properties for Translations", "text": "In what follows, we understand as a translation Tr a function which maps AFs to AFs. In particular, we seek translations, such that for given semantics \u03c3, \u03c3\u2032, the extensions \u03c3(F ) are in a certain relation to extensions \u03c3\u2032(F ) for each AF F . To start with, we introduce a few additional properties which seem desirable for such translations. To this end, we define, for\nAFs F = (A, R), F \u2032 = (A\u2032, R\u2032), the union of AFs as F \u222aF \u2032 = (A\u222aA\u2032, R\u222aR\u2032), and inclusion as F \u2286 F \u2032 iff jointly A \u2286 A\u2032 and R \u2286 R\u2032.\nDefinition 4. A translation Tr is called\n\u2022 efficient if for every AF F , the AF Tr (F ) can be computed using logarithmic space wrt. to |F |;\n\u2022 covering if for every AF F , F \u2286 Tr (F );\n\u2022 embedding if for every AF F , AF \u2286 ATr (F ) and RF = RTr (F ) \u2229 (AF \u00d7 AF );\n\u2022 monotone if for any AFs F, F \u2032, F \u2286 F \u2032 implies Tr (F ) \u2286 Tr (F \u2032);\n\u2022 modular if for any AFs F, F \u2032, Tr (F ) \u222a Tr (F \u2032) = Tr (F \u222a F \u2032).\nA translation should not reduce the expressiveness of a semantic using some expensive computation. Thus the computational cost of a translation should be less than the computational cost of any semantic under our focus, i.e. less than P. Thus using the class of logarithmic space computable functions is appropriate for our purposes. In addition, one could seek translations which are minimal wrt. certain parameters (for instance, number of additional arguments and attacks). However, we decided not to design our translations towards such aims, since this would partly hide the main intuitions underlying the translations.\nWhile the property of efficiency is clearly motivated, let us spend a few words on the other properties. Covering holding ensures that the translation does not hide some original arguments or conflicts. Being embedding, in addition, ensures that no additional attacks between the original arguments are pretended. While efficiency is motivated by expressiveness and the possibility to reuse reasoning algorithms, the properties of covering and embedding can be motivated by the meta-argumentation scenario. Translations which are covering or embedding preserve the arguments and conflicts we (meta)-argue about, an assumption one usually has in mind in the context of meta-argumentation. To put it in other words, having an embedding translation, the original framework and the meta-level part are clearly separated in the translated framework.\nMonotonicity and modularity are crucial when extending the source AF after translation. Let us first consider monotonicity. In multi-agent scenarios it may be impossible for one agent to withdraw already interchanged arguments and attacks, as the other agents may not agree to forget arguments and conflicts they already know about; hence, re-translating the augmented source AF should respect the already existing translation. Now let us consider modularity and adding only a few arguments/attacks to a huge AF. When updating the translation it suffices to only consider the new arguments/attacks, instead of the whole source AF, which indeed can be of computational value. In the field of meta-argumentation, modular translations are in particular interesting as they are compatible with merging AFs. Thus one can interchange merge- and translation-operations, i.e. it does not make a difference if one first merges two AFs and then translates the union or first translates both AFs and then merges the translations. Moreover, as it can be easily checked each modular transformation is also monotone.\nNext, we give two properties which refer to semantics. We note that our concept of faithfulness follows the definition used by Janhunen (1999); while exactness is in the spirit of bijective faithfulness wrt. equivalence as used by Liberatore (2007).\nDefinition 5. For semantics \u03c3, \u03c3\u2032 we call a translation Tr\n\u2022 exact for \u03c3 \u21d2 \u03c3\u2032 if for every AF F , \u03c3(F ) = \u03c3\u2032(Tr (F ));\n\u2022 faithful for \u03c3 \u21d2 \u03c3\u2032 if for every AF F , \u03c3(F ) = {E \u2229 AF | E \u2208 \u03c3 \u2032(Tr (F ))} and\n|\u03c3(F )| = |\u03c3\u2032(Tr (F ))|.\nHowever, due to the very nature of the different semantics we want to consider, we need some less restricted notions. For instance, if we consider a translation from stable to some other semantics, we have to face the fact that some AFs do not possess a stable extension, while other semantics always yield at least one extension. The following definition takes care of this issue.\nDefinition 6. For semantics \u03c3, \u03c3\u2032, we call a translation Tr\n\u2022 weakly exact for \u03c3 \u21d2 \u03c3\u2032 if there exists a collection S of sets of arguments, such that for any AF F , \u03c3(F ) = \u03c3\u2032(Tr (F )) \\ S;\n\u2022 weakly faithful for \u03c3 \u21d2 \u03c3\u2032 if there exists a collection S of sets of arguments, such that for any AF F , \u03c3(F ) = {E \u2229 AF | E \u2208 \u03c3 \u2032(Tr (F )) \\ S} and |\u03c3(F )| = |\u03c3\u2032(Tr (F )) \\ S|.\nWe sometimes refer to the elements from S as remainder sets. Note that S depends only on the translation, but not on the input AF. Thus, by definition, each S \u2208 S only contains arguments which never occur in AFs subject to translation. In other words, we reserve certain arguments for introduction in weak translations.\nFinally, we mention that the properties from Definition 4 as well as being exact, weakly exact and faithful are transitive, i.e. for two transformations satisfying one of these properties, also the concatenation satisfies the respective property. However, transitivity is not guaranteed for being weakly faithful."}, {"heading": "4. Translations", "text": "In this section, we provide numerous faithful translations between the semantics introduced in Definition 3. As minimal desiderata, we want the translations to be efficient, monotone, and covering (see Definition 4). Thus, in this section when speaking about translations we tacitly assume that they satisfy at least these three properties."}, {"heading": "4.1 Exact Translations", "text": "We start with a rather simple such translation, which we will show to be exact for prf \u21d2 sem and adm \u21d2 com.\nTranslation 1. The translation Tr1 is defined as Tr1(F ) = (A \u2217, R\u2217), where\nA\u2217 = AF \u222a A \u2032 F R\u2217 = RF \u222a {(a, a \u2032), (a\u2032, a), (a\u2032, a\u2032) | a\u2208AF },\nwith A\u2032F = {a \u2032 | a\u2208AF }.\nA few words about the intuition behind the above translation (for illustration see Figure 4 which depicts the translation of our example AF from Example 1): the new arguments a\u2032 \u2208 A\u2032F are all self-attacking and thus never appear in any extension of the resulting framework. However, each a\u2032 attacks the original argument a (and a attacks a\u2032), thus an argument a is only defended by a set E in Tr1(F ) if a \u2208 E. Consequently, we have that in Tr1(F ) each admissible set is also a complete one.\nLemma 1. For an AF F and a set E of arguments, the following propositions are equivalent:\n1. E \u2208 adm(F )\n2. E \u2208 adm(Tr1(F ))\n3. E \u2208 com(Tr1(F ))\nProof. As all arguments in A\u2032F are self-conflicting, every conflict-free set E of Tr1(F ) satisfies E \u2286 AF . Further, since Tr1 is embedding, E is conflict-free in F iff E is conflict-free in Tr1(F ). Moreover, since Tr1 only adds symmetric attacks against arguments a \u2208 AF , we have that E defends its arguments in F iff E defends its arguments in Tr1(F ). Thus, adm(F ) = adm(Tr1(F )) and (1)\u21d4(2) follows. For (2)\u21d2(3), let a \u2208 A be an arbitrary argument and E \u2286 A. In Tr1(F ) the argument a is attacked by a\n\u2032 and a is the only attacker (except a\u2032 itself) of a\u2032. Hence, for each a \u2208 A, E defends a only if a \u2208 E and thus every admissible set of Tr1(F ) is also a complete one. Finally, (2)\u21d0(3) holds since com(F ) \u2286 adm(F ) is true for any AF F .\nConcerning Tr1 we observe another side effect. As already mentioned a \u2208 A is the only argument attacking a\u2032. Thus different preferred extensions of Tr1(F ) have incomparable range (recall Definition 2), and therefore each preferred extension of Tr1(F ) is also a semistable extension of Tr1(F ).\nLemma 2. For an AF F and a set E of arguments, the following propositions are equivalent:\n1. E \u2208 prf (F )\n2. E \u2208 prf (Tr1(F ))\n3. E \u2208 sem(Tr1(F ))\nProof. For (1)\u21d4(2), it is sufficient to show that E \u2208 adm(F ) iff E \u2208 adm(Tr1(F )) holds for each E. This is captured by Lemma 1. For (2)\u21d2(3), let D, E \u2208 prf (Tr1(F )) and, towards a contradiction, assume that D+R\u2217 \u2282 E + R\u2217 , i.e. D /\u2208 sem(Tr1(F )). As both D and\nE are preferred extensions, we have D 6\u2286 E. Thus, there exists an argument a \u2208 D \\ E. By construction of Tr1(F ), we get a \u2032 \u2208 D+R\u2217 but a \u2032 /\u2208 E+R\u2217 , a contradiction to D + R\u2217 \u2282 E + R\u2217 . (2)\u21d0(3) follows from the fact sem(F ) \u2286 prf (F ) for any AF F .\nObviously Tr1 is an embedding translation and as the introduction of a new argument or attack in Tr1 only depends on one original argument it is also modular. Together with the results from Lemma 1 and 2 we thus get our first main result.\nTheorem 1. Tr1 is a modular, embedding, and exact translation for prf \u21d2 sem and adm \u21d2 com.\nOur next translation, Tr2, is concerned with stage and semi-stable semantics. In addition to Tr1, we make all attacks from the original AF symmetric (thus Tr2 will not be embedding) and add for each original attack (a, b) also an attack (a, b\u2032).\nTranslation 2. The translation Tr2 is defined as Tr2(F ) = (A \u2217, R\u2217), where\nA\u2217 = AF \u222a A \u2032 F R\u2217 = RF \u222a {(b, a), (a, b \u2032) | (a, b) \u2208 RF }\n\u222a {(a, b) | a \u2208 AF , (b, b) \u2208 RF } \u222a {(a, a\u2032), (a\u2032, a\u2032) | a \u2208 AF }\nThe symmetric attacks in Tr2(F ) mirror the fact that we do not mind the orientation of attacks when considering conflict-freeness. In other words, we exploit the well known property that for symmetric frameworks conflict-free and admissible sets coincide. However, making attacks symmetric destroys the original range of extensions. Thus we make use of arguments a\u2032 \u2208 A\u2032F in the sense that, for a given set E of arguments, an argument a\n\u2032 is contained in E+R\u2217 iff a is contained in E + R . Likewise, we have to add attacks into selfdefeating arguments. The technical reason for this is that we require that each original argument is attacked by a maximal conflict-free non-empty set in Tr2(F ) (see also the proof of the forthcoming lemma). For illustration we refer to Figure 5.\nLemma 3. For an AF F and any set E of arguments, the following propositions are equivalent:\n1. E \u2208 stg(F )\n2. E \u2208 stg(Tr2(F ))\n3. E \u2208 sem(Tr2(F ))\nProof. First, we mention that every stage extension of an AF F is also maximal (wrt. \u2286) conflict-free in F . Let us now consider the case where \u2205 \u2208 stg(F ). We then have that stg(F ) = {\u2205} which is equivalent to, for each a \u2208 AF also (a, a) \u2208 RF . Then by construction of Tr2 for each a \u2208 A\n\u2217 also (a, a) \u2208 R\u2217 and therefore stg(Tr2(F )) = sem(Tr2(F )) = {\u2205}. Hence the lemma holds for such AFs, and for the remainder of the proof we can assume that \u2205 6\u2208 stg(F ).\nFor (1)\u21d4(2), we again observe that a set E is conflict-free in F iff it is conflict-free in Tr2(F ). In the following we use (E\n+ RF )\u2032 as a short hand for {a\u2032 \u2208 A\u2032 | a \u2208 E+RF }. Then\nwe have that (E+RF ) \u2032 \u2286 E+R\u2217 , since for each (a, b) \u2208 RF , we have (a, b \u2032) \u2208 R\u2217. Furthermore, for each maximal conflict-free set E in F (and thus in Tr2(F )), it holds that AF \u2286 E + R\u2217 . We show this by contradiction. To this end, let us assume that AF 6\u2286 E + R\u2217 , i.e. there exists a \u2208 AF such that a 6\u2208 E + R\u2217 . As E 6= \u2205 we have that all self-attacking arguments are contained in E+R\u2217 , thus (a, a) 6\u2208 R \u2217. As a 6\u2208 E+R\u2217 we have that E 6\nR a and a 6R E, but then the set E\u222a{a} is conflict-free in F and as E is maximal a \u2208 E; a contradiction. Hence, for each maximal conflict-free set E \u2286 AF in F , i.e. the candidates for stage extensions, it holds that E+R\u2217 = AF \u222a (E + RF )\u2032 and thus E+RF is maximal (wrt. subset inclusion) iff E + R\u2217 is maximal.\nFor (2)\u21d4(3), observe that each a \u2208 AF with (a, a) 6\u2208 R \u2217 defends itself in Tr2(F ) and all arguments a\u2032 \u2208 A\u2032F are self-conflicting. Thus, admissible and conflict-free sets coincide in Tr2(F ). Consequently, the stage and semi-stable extensions of Tr2(F ) coincide.\nBy definition the translation Tr2 is covering, but not embedding. Moreover, as each selfattacking argument is attacked by all of the other arguments Tr2 is not modular. Together with the above lemma, we thus obtain the following result.\nTheorem 2. Tr2 is an exact translation for stg \u21d2 sem.\nThe next translations consider the stable semantics as source formalism. Recall that not all AFs possess a stable extension, while this holds for all other semantics (also recall we excluded empty AFs for our considerations). Thus we have to use weak translations as introduced in Definition 6. Our first such translation is weakly exact and uses a single remainder set {t} (recall the definition of remainder sets as given in Definition 6).\nTranslation 3. The translation Tr3(F ) is defined as Tr3(F ) = (A \u2217, R\u2217) where\nA\u2217 = AF \u222a {t} R\u2217 = RF \u222a {(t, a), (a, t) | a \u2208 AF }\nHere the intuition is rather simple, see also Figure 6. In fact, the new argument t in Tr3(F ) encodes that there might not exist a stable extension for F . Thus none of the (other) arguments in Tr3(F ) is accepted, whenever t is accepted. Since the argument t guards that there exists at least one stable extension of Tr3(F ) (for any AF F ), namely {t}, we can make use of the fact that stable, semi-stable and stage semantics thus coincide for Tr3(F ).\nLemma 4. Let F = (A, R) be an AF and E \u2286 A. Then the following statements are equivalent:\n1. E \u2208 stb(F )\n2. E \u2208 stb(Tr3(F ))\n3. E \u2208 sem(Tr3(F ))\n4. E \u2208 stg(Tr3(F ))\nFurther for each E \u2208 \u03c3(Tr3(F )) with \u03c3 \u2208 {stb, sem, stg} either E = {t} or t 6\u2208 E holds.\nProof. As the translation does not modify the original AF F , i.e. Tr3 is embedding, we have that for each E \u2286 AF , E is conflict-free in F iff E is conflict-free in Tr3(F ).\n(1)\u21d2(2): Each E \u2208 stb(F ) by definition is non-empty, conflict-free and satisfies E+RF =\nAF . By construction it also holds that E  R\u2217 t and thus E+R\u2217 = A \u2217, i.e. E \u2208 stb(Tr3(F )). For (1)\u21d0(2) consider E \u2208 stb(Tr3(F )), E \u2286 AF . Then by definition we have that E is conflict-free in Tr3(F )) and thus in F ; moreover, E + R\u2217 = A\n\u2217 and as Tr3 is embedding also E+R = AF . Hence E \u2208 stb(F ).\nFor (2)\u21d4(3)\u21d4(4), we mention that {t} is a stable extension of Tr3(F ) for any AF F . Furthermore, we know that if there exists a stable extension for an AF, then stable, semi-stable and stage extensions coincide.\nFinally as the argument t is in conflict with all of the other arguments the only extension E with t \u2208 E is the set {t}.\nAdding argument t and the corresponding attacks to the source AF is a modular operation and as no further attacks are added Tr3 is also embedding.\nTheorem 3. Tr3 is modular, embedding and weakly exact for stb\u21d2\u03c3, \u03c3\u2208{sem, stg}.\nProof. The result follows from Lemma 4, which states that sem(Tr3(F )) = stg(Tr3(F )) = stb(F ) \u222a {{t}}. Thus by taking as remainder set S = {{t}}, Tr3 is weakly exact.\nWe continue with a different translation from stable to other semantics.\nTranslation 4. Tr4 is defined as Tr4(F ) = (A \u2217, R\u2217) where\nA\u2217 = AF \u222a A \u2032 F R\u2217 = RF \u222a {(b \u2032, a) | a, b \u2208 AF }\n\u222a {(a\u2032, a\u2032), (a, a\u2032) | a \u2208 AF } \u222a {(a, b\u2032) | (a, b) \u2208 RF }.\nAs before in translation Tr2, new arguments a \u2032 \u2208 A\u2032F are used to encode the range of an extension in the sense that a\u2032 is attacked by a set E in Tr4(F ) only if a is in the range of E in F . However, given the fact that each a\u2032 \u2208 A\u2032F attacks back all original arguments a \u2208 A, we can now accept an argument in a set E only if all arguments are in the range of E. For illustration on our running example, see Figure 7. Observe that in our example each of the arguments a\u2032, b\u2032, c\u2032, d\u2032, e\u2032 attacks each of the arguments a, b, c, d, e.\nLemma 5. Let F = (A, R) be an AF and E \u2286 A with E 6= \u2205. Then, the following statements are equivalent:\n1. E \u2208 stb(F )\n2. E \u2208 stb(Tr4(F ))\n3. E \u2208 adm(Tr4(F ))\n4. E \u2208 prf (Tr4(F ))\n5. E \u2208 com(Tr4(F ))\n6. E \u2208 sem(Tr4(F ))\nFurther for each conflict-free set E of Tr4(F ) it holds that E \u2286 A.\nProof. First, as all arguments a\u2032 \u2208 A\u2032 are self-attacking, for each conflict-free set E in Tr4(F ) it holds that E \u2286 A. Since the translation is embedding, any set E is conflict-free in F iff it is conflict-free in Tr4(F ). To show (1)\u21d2(2), let E \u2208 stb(F ). Hence, for all a \u2208 A \\ E, E R a. We now claim that each argument in A\u2217 \\ E is attacked by E in Tr4(F ). We distinguish between two cases for the different arguments in A \u2217 \\ E:\n(i) a \u2208 A \\ E: The construction of Tr4(F ) preserves all attacks in R. Thus as each a \u2208 A \\ E satisfies E R a, we obtain that E R \u2217 a\n(ii) a\u2032 \u2208 A\u2032: In case a \u2208 E we have E R \u2217 a\u2032, since (a, a\u2032) \u2208 R\u2217 In case a \u2208 A \\ E, by the assumption E \u2208 stb(F ), there exists an argument b \u2208 E such that (b, a) \u2208 R. But then by construction (b, a\u2032) \u2208 R\u2217 and thus E R \u2217 a\u2032.\nTogether with our observations about conflict-free sets, we get E \u2208 stb(Tr4(F )). Vice versa, to show (1)\u21d0(2) we get, for E \u2208 stb(Tr4(F )), E \nR\u2217 a, for each a \u2208 A\u2217 \\E, and thus, in particular, for each a \u2208 A \\ E. By definition of Tr4, we also have E \nR a for each a \u2208 A \\ E. Thus E \u2208 stb(F ) follows.\nTo show (2)\u21d0(3), let E be a nonempty admissible extension of Tr4(F ) and a \u2208 E. By construction, we have that a\u2212 := {b \u2208 A\u2217 | (b, a) \u2208 R\u2217} \u2287 A\u2032. As E \u2208 adm(Tr4(F )), E R \u2217 a\u2032 for each a\u2032 \u2208 A\u2032. But E  a\u2032 only if either a \u2208 E or E R \u2217\na. Thus for every a \u2208 A\u2217 it holds that either a \u2208 E or E R \u2217\na; hence, E \u2208 stb(Tr4(F )). The remaining implications follow by well-known relations between the semantics, i.e. stb(G) \u2286 sem(G) \u2286 prf (G) \u2286 com(G) \u2286 adm(G), for each AF G. Hence, in particular, since for Tr4(F ), stable extensions and non-empty admissible sets coincide, the claim follows.\nClearly Tr4 is an embedding translation, but as for each new argument we add attacks to all original arguments, Tr4 is not modular.\nTheorem 4. Tr4 is an embedding and weakly exact translation for stb \u21d2 \u03c3 with \u03c3 \u2208 {adm, com, prf , sem}.\nProof. By Lemma 5, we in particular have that stb(F ) = \u03c3(Tr4(F )) \\ {\u2205}, for any AF F . Thus taking \u2205 as a remainder set, we obtain that Tr4 is weakly exact for the involved semantics.\nThus we have that both Tr3 and Tr4 are weakly exact translations for stb \u21d2 sem, of course with different remainder sets. Due the to different properties of two translations it depends on the concrete application which of them would be the better choice."}, {"heading": "4.2 Faithful Translations", "text": "So far, we have only introduced exact and weakly exact translations. We now present translations which relax this semantical property, i.e. we switch to faithful translations. As a first example, we consider a translation for stg \u21d2 sem which is faithful and embedding, but not exact. This is in contrast to translation Tr2 which is exact for stg \u21d2 sem but not embedding. As we will see in Section 5 it is impossible to give a translation that is both embedding and exact for stg \u21d2 sem, thus one has to decide which property is more important for a concrete application scenario.\nTranslation 5. The translation Tr5(F ) is defined as Tr5(F ) = (A \u2217, R\u2217) where\nA\u2217 = AF \u222a A\u0304F \u222a A \u2032 F R\u2217 = RF \u222a {(a, a\u0304), (a\u0304, a) | a \u2208 AF }\n\u222a {(a, a\u2032), (a\u2032, a\u2032) | a \u2208 AF } \u222a {(a, b\u2032) | (a, b) \u2208 RF }\nAs in Tr2(F ) the arguments a \u2032 \u2208 A\u2032F handle the range of the original extensions. But instead of making original attacks symmetric (as in Tr2) we add the arguments a\u0304 \u2208 A\u0304F to encode that an argument is not in the extension (also compare Figures 5 and 8). In fact, such meta-arguments indicating that some a is out of an extension will be used in all faithful translations presented in this subsection.\nLemma 6. Let F = (A, R) be an AF, E \u2286 A and E\u2217 = E \u222a (A \\ E). The following statements are equivalent:\n1. E \u2208 stg(F )\n2. E\u2217 \u2208 stg(Tr5(F ))\n3. E\u2217 \u2208 sem(Tr5(F ))\nMoreover for each S \u2208 sem(Tr5(F )) there exists a set E \u2286 A such that S = E \u222a (A \\ E).\nProof. First we prove that each S \u2208 stg(Tr5(F )) is of the form S = E \u222a (A \\ E). As S is conflict-free we have that A\u2032F \u2229 S = \u2205 (each a\n\u2032 \u2208 A\u2032 is self-attacking) and for each a \u2208 A that {a, a\u0304} 6\u2286 E\u2217 (as a attacks a\u0304 and vice versa). Further as each stage extension is also a \u2286-maximal conflict-free set we have that for each a \u2208 A either a \u2208 S or a\u0304 \u2208 S. Hence there exists an E \u2286 A such that S = E \u222a (A \\ E).\n(1)\u21d2(2): Let E \u2208 stg(F ). It is easy to see that E\u2217 is conflict-free in Tr5(F ). By construction for each argument a \u2208 A either a \u2208 E\u2217 or a\u0304 \u2208 E\u2217 holds and there are mutual attacks between a and a\u0304, hence we have that A \u222a A\u0304 \u2286 (E\u2217)+R\u2217 . Next we observe that each a\u2032 \u2208 A\u2032 is self-attacking and thus a\u2032 \u2208 (E\u2217)+R\u2217 iff E\n\u2217  a\u2032. Further by the definition of Tr5(F ) each argument a\n\u2032 is attacked by a and all arguments b such that (b, a) \u2208 R. That is a\u2032 \u2208 (E\u2217)+R\u2217 iff either a \u2208 E or there exists a b \u2208 A such that (b, a) \u2208 R iff a \u2208 (E) + R. By assumption E is a stage extension of F and thus we have that (E)+R is \u2286-maximal. Using the above observation we have that also (E\u2217)+R\u2217 is \u2286-maximal in Tr5(F ) and therefore E\u2217 \u2208 stg(Tr5(F )).\n(1)\u21d0(2): Let E\u2217 \u2208 stg(Tr5(F )). We recall that E \u2217 is of the form S = E \u222a (A \\ E), for some E \u2286 A. It can be easily checked that E is conflict-free in F . By the above observation that a\u2032 \u2208 (E\u2217)+R\u2217 iff a \u2208 (E) + R and the fact that (E\n\u2217)+R\u2217 is \u2286-maximal in Tr5(F ) we get that also E+R is \u2286-maximal in F . Hence, E \u2208 stg(F ).\n(2)\u21d4(3): Let us consider E\u2217 \u2208 stg(Tr5(F )). As we have already observed, E \u2217 is of the desired form and for each a \u2208 AF \u222aA\u0304F either a \u2208 E \u2217 or E\u2217  a. Further by construction an argument b \u2208 A\u2032F does not attack E \u2217. We can conclude that each stage extension defends itself against all attackers, i.e. is an admissible set. Hence, stage and semi-stable extensions of Tr5(F ) coincide.\nBy above lemma and construction of Tr5, the following result is immediate.\nTheorem 5. Tr5 is a modular, embedding and faithful translation for stg \u21d2 sem.\nNext we give a faithful translation from admissible semantics to stable, semi-stable and stage semantics.\nTranslation 6. The translation Tr6(F ) is defined as Tr6(F ) = (A \u2217, R\u2217) where\nA\u2217 = AF \u222a A\u0304F \u222a RF R\u2217 = RF \u222a {(a, a\u0304), (a\u0304, a) | a \u2208 AF }\n\u222a {(r, r) | r \u2208 RF }\n\u222a {(a\u0304, r) | r = (y, a) \u2208 RF }\n\u222a {(a, r) | r = (z, y) \u2208 RF , (a, z) \u2208 RF }\nThe main idea is to use additional arguments (a, b) \u2208 A\u2217 which represent the attack relations from the source framework in order to capture admissibility as follows: (a, b) is attacked by an extension E\u2217 in Tr6(F ) if (a, b) is not critical wrt. the corresponding extension E in F , meaning that either b /\u2208 E or there exists a c \u2208 E such (c, b) \u2208 RF , i.e. a is defended by E. For instance, consider the argument (c, b) in the translation of our example framework as depicted in Figure 9. Then, we have that (1) b\u0304 attacks (c, b) since if b is chosen to be out (i.e. b\u0304 is chosen in), there is no need to defend b; (2) d attacks (c, b) since if d is chosen in, d defends b against attacker c (recall that (d, c) is present in the source AF). Thus, as long as (c, b) is attacked by some argument, b is treated corrected in terms of admissibility (wrt. attacker c). Note that in our example b cannot be defended against a, thus the only way to get (a, b) into the range is to select b to be out.\nLemma 7. Let F = (A, R) be an AF, E \u2286 A and E\u2217 = E \u222a (A \\ E). The following statements are equivalent:\n1. E \u2208 adm(F )\n2. E\u2217 \u2208 stb(Tr6(F ))\n3. E\u2217 \u2208 sem(Tr6(F ))\n4. E\u2217 \u2208 stg(Tr6(F ))\nMoreover for each E\u2217 \u2208 \u03c3(Tr6(F )) (\u03c3 \u2208 {stb, sem, stg}) there exists a set E \u2286 A such that E\u2217 = E \u222a (A \\ E).\nProof. (1)\u21d2(2): Let E \u2208 adm(F ). It is easy to see that E\u2217 is conflict-free in Tr6(F ) and further that A \u222a A\u0304 \u2286 (E\u2217)+R\u2217 . It remains to show that each argument r \u2208 A \u2217 for r \u2208 R is\nattacked by E\u2217. Let (a, b) be such an argument r. If b /\u2208 E then b\u0304 \u2208 E\u2217 and thus E\u2217 R \u2217\nr. Otherwise, b \u2208 E (thus b \u2208 E\u2217) and, by assumption, E defends b in F , i.e. (c, a) \u2208 R for some c \u2208 E (thus c \u2208 E\u2217). By construction, (c, r) \u2208 R\u2217 and E\u2217 R \u2217\nr. (1)\u21d0(2): Let E\u2217 \u2208 stb(Tr6(F )). E \u2217 is conflict-free, thus R \u2229 E\u2217 = \u2205 and {a, a\u0304} 6\u2286 E\u2217 for all a \u2208 A. By construction, E is conflict-free in F . It remains to show that E defends all its arguments in F . Let b \u2208 A \\ E such that b R a for some a \u2208 E. Then there exists an argument (b, a) in Tr6(F ) attacked by E. As a \u2208 E we have that a\u0304 /\u2208 E\n\u2217 and thus there exists an argument c \u2208 E such that (c, b) \u2208 R.\n(2)\u21d4(3)\u21d4(4): As the empty set is always admissible we have that A\u0304 is always a stable extension of Tr6(F ). Hence, stable, semi-stable and stage extensions coincide in Tr6(F ), for any AF F .\nObserve that in the construction of Tr6 drawing attacks {(a, r) | r = (z, y) \u2208 RF , (a, z) \u2208 RF } depends on two attacks and three arguments from the original framework. Hence Tr6 is not modular. By Lemma 7 the next result follows quite easily.\nTheorem 6. Translation Tr6 is embedding and faithful for adm \u21d2 \u03c3 (\u03c3 \u2208 {stb, sem, stg}).\nIn our faithful translation from complete to stable semantics which we present next, we extend the given AF by arguments that represent whether an argument is attacked in the corresponding extension or not. Further we add arguments that ensure admissibility and completeness. The entire translation is thus slightly more complicated; see also Figure 10 which depicts the translated framework for our running example.\nTranslation 7. The translation Tr7(F ) is defined as Tr7(F ) = (A \u2217, R\u2217) where\nA\u2217 = AF \u222a A\u0304F \u222a A \u25e6 F \u222a A\u0304 \u25e6 F \u222a A \u2032 F \u222a RF R\u2217 = RF \u222a {(x, x) | x \u2208 A \u2032 F \u222a RF }\n\u222a {(a, a\u0304), (a\u0304, a), (a\u0304\u25e6, a\u25e6), (a, a\u2032) | a \u2208 AF } \u222a {(a, b\u0304\u25e6), (a\u0304\u25e6, b\u2032) | (a, b) \u2208 RF } \u222a {(a\u0304, r\u2032), (b\u25e6, r\u2032) | r = (b, a) \u2208 RF }\nThe intuition behind arguments A\u2032F , A\u0304F , and RF is similar as in previous translations. An argument a\u25e6 \u2208 A\u25e6F indicates that a is attacked by an extension E of F , while a\u0304\n\u25e6 \u2208 A\u0304\u25e6F says that a is not attacked by E.\nLemma 8. Let F = (A, R) be an AF, E \u2286 A and E\u2217 = E\u222a (A \\ E)\u222a{a\u25e6 | E R a}\u222a{a\u0304\u25e6 | E 6R a}. Then the following statements are equivalent:\n1. E \u2208 com(F )\n2. E\u2217 \u2208 stb(Tr7(F ))\n3. E\u2217 \u2208 sem(Tr7(F ))\n4. E\u2217 \u2208 stg(Tr7(F ))\nMoreover for each E\u2217 \u2208 \u03c3(Tr6(F )) (\u03c3 \u2208 {stb, sem, stg}) there exists a set E \u2286 A such that E\u2217 = E \u222a (A \\ E) \u222a {a\u25e6 | E R a} \u222a {a\u0304\u25e6 | E 6R a}.\nProof. To show (1)\u21d2(2), let E \u2208 com(F ). Then by construction E\u2217 is conflict-free in Tr7(F ) (for x, y \u2208 E we have x  R y \u21d4 x R \u2217\ny). Moreover, by definition of E\u2217, it can be verified that A \u222a A\u0304 \u222a A\u25e6 \u222a A\u0304\u25e6 \u2286 (E\u2217)+R\u2217 . Thus it remains to show that (i) A\n\u2032 \u2286 (E\u2217)+R\u2217 and (ii) R \u2286 (E\u2217)+R\u2217 .\n(i) Let a \u2208 A be an arbitrary argument of F . As E is a complete extension we have that either a \u2208 E, and thus a \u2208 E\u2217, or there exists an attack (b, a) \u2208 R with E 6R b, and thus b\u0304\u25e6 \u2208 E\u2217. As by construction (b\u0304\u25e6, a\u2032) \u2208 R\u2217 we thus have that E\u2217 R \u2217 a\u2032.\n(ii) Let r = (b, a) \u2208 R be an arbitrary attack of F . As E is admissible it holds that either a /\u2208 E, and thus a\u0304 \u2208 E\u2217, or E R b, and thus b\u25e6 \u2208 E\u2217. In both cases E\u2217 R \u2217 r.\nPutting things together, we get that A \u222a A\u0304 \u222a A\u25e6 \u222a A\u0304\u25e6 \u222a A\u2032 \u222a R = A\u2217 \u2286 (E\u2217)+R\u2217 which is equivalent to E\u2217 being a stable extension of Tr7(F ).\nTo show (1)\u21d0(2), let E\u2217 \u2208 stb(Tr7(F )). First we prove that E \u2217 is of the desired form. As E\u2217 is both conflict-free and \u2286-maximal we clearly have that E\u2217 \u2229 (A \u222a A\u0304) = E \u222a A \\ E for some E \u2286 A. Let now a \u2208 A be an arbitrary argument. We have that a\u25e6 \u2208 E\u2217 iff a\u0304\u25e6 6\u2208 E\u2217. But as E\u2217 is stable a\u0304\u25e6 6\u2208 E\u2217 iff there exists an attack (b, a\u0304\u25e6) such that b \u2208 E\u2217. By construction of Tr7(F ) this is equivalent to b \u2208 E and therefore E \nR a. Thus E\u2217 is of the desired form, it remains to show that E is complete. As mentioned before we have for x, y \u2208 E : x R y \u21d4 x R \u2217\ny and thus E is conflict-free in F . Thus it remains to show that (i) E defends each of its arguments in F and (ii) E contains each argument defended by E in F .\n(i) Let us assume there exists an argument a \u2208 E not defended by E. Thus there exists r = (b, a) \u2208 R, E 6 b. By construction we also have that a\u0304 /\u2208 E\u2217 (as a \u2208 E) and b\u25e6 6\u2208 E\u2217 (as E 6 b). But in Tr7(F ) the self-attacking argument r is only attacked by the arguments a\u0304, b\u25e6 (and itself). Hence, this is in contradiction to E\u2217 being a stable extension.\n(ii) Let a \u2208 A be an argument defended by E. Then for all arguments b R a we have that E R b and thus b\u25e6 \u2208 E\u2217 and b\u0304\u25e6 /\u2208 E\u2217. Recall that in Tr7(F ) the argument a\n\u2032 is self-attacking and thus does not belong to E\u2217 and is only attacked by the arguments b\u0304\u25e6 and a. As E\u2217 is a stable extension and a\u2032 6\u2208 E\u2217 we have that a \u2208 E\u2217 and a \u2208 E.\n(2) \u21d4 (3) \u21d4 (4): As there always exists a complete extension we know that any framework Tr7(F ) has a stable extension. But then stable, stage and semi-stable extensions coincide.\nTranslation Tr7 introduces a huge number of new arguments, despite this the introduction of a concrete argument or attack only depends on a single argument or attack. Hence Tr7 is modular. It is easily checked that Tr7 is also embedding. Together with Lemma 8 we thus can state the following result for Tr7.\nTheorem 7. Tr7 is a modular, embedding and faithful translation for com \u21d2 \u03c3 (\u03c3 \u2208 {stb, sem, stg}).\nFinally we present a translation from grounded semantics to most of the other semantics under our focus, i.e. to all semantics except admissible semantics. The main idea is to simulate the computation of the least fixed-point of the characteristic function FF (S) = {x \u2208 AF | x is defended by S} of an AF F within the target AF.\nTranslation 8. The translation Tr8(F ) is defined as Tr8(F ) = (A \u2217, R\u2217) where\nA\u2217 = AF,1 \u222a A\u0304 \u25e6 F,1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a AF,l \u222a A\u0304 \u25e6 F,l R\u2217 = RF \u222a {(a\u0304 \u25e6 i , bi) | (a, b) \u2208 R, i \u2208 [l]}\n\u222a {(ai, b\u0304 \u25e6 i+1) | (a, b) \u2208 R, i \u2208 [l \u2212 1]}\nwith AF = AF,l and l = \u2308 |AF |\n2 \u2309.\nFor illustration, we use here a slightly different example depicted in Figure 11(a). Observe that this AF has {a, c, d} as its grounded extension. The translated framework is given in Figure 11(b).\nThe intuition behind arguments ai \u2208 AF,i is that a \u2208 F i F (\u2205), while the intuition of\na\u0304\u25e6i \u2208 A\u0304 \u25e6 F,i is that F (i\u22121) F (\u2205) 6 a. The integer l is an upper bound for the number of iterations we need to reach the least fixed-point, i.e. the grounded extension.\nLemma 9. Let F = (A, R) be an AF and E\u2217 the grounded extension of Tr8(F ). Then E\u2217 \u2229 A is the grounded extension of F . We further have that on Tr8(F ) the grounded, stable, complete, preferred, semi-stable and stage extensions coincide.\nProof. We recall the definition of the characteristic function FF of an AF F , defined as FF (S) = {x \u2208 AF | x is defended by S}, and that the grounded extension of F is the least fix-point of FF . Further we use as a shorthand F\n\u2217 = Tr8(F ). One can show that for arbitrary a \u2208 A we have\n(i) ai \u2208 E \u2217 iff a \u2208 F iF (\u2205);\n(ii) a\u0304\u25e6i \u2208 E \u2217 iff F i\u22121F (\u2205) 6 R a; and\n(iii) AF,i \u2286 (E \u2217)+R\u2217 .\n(iv) A\u0304\u25e6F,i \u2286 (E \u2217)+R\u2217 .\nWe prove this by structural induction. As induction base we show (ii) and (iv) for the arguments a\u0304\u25e61. For a \u2208 A we have that a\u0304 \u25e6 1 \u2208 E\n\u2217 as they are not attacked by any argument. This coincides with the fact that F0F (\u2205) = \u2205 doesn\u2019t attack any argument and thus (ii) and (iv) holds.\nWe have two induction steps: (1) Showing that (i) and (iii) hold for arbitrary n iff (ii) and (iv) hold for n; and (2) showing that (ii) and (iv) hold for arbitrary n iff (i) and (iii) hold for n \u2212 1.\n(1) We assume (ii) and (iv) hold for all a\u0304\u25e6n. By the definition of FF we have that a \u2208 F n F (\u2205)\niff all b \u2208 a\u2212 = {b \u2208 A | b  a} are attacked by Fn\u22121F (\u2205). Applying the induction hypothesis (ii) to b \u2208 a\u2212 we obtain that a \u2208 FnF (\u2205) iff each b\u0304 \u25e6 i \u2208 {b\u0304 \u25e6 i | (b, a) \u2208 R} is attacked by E\u2217. Further, as by the construction of Tr8(F ) these are the only attackers of a, this is equivalent to argument ai being defended by E\n\u2217. Now recall that the each argument defended by the grounded extension is indeed contained in the grounded extension. Hence, a \u2208 FnF (\u2205) iff ai \u2208 E \u2217 and (i) holds. To show (iii) we consider ai \u2208 AF,i. If ai \u2208 E \u2217 then clearly ai \u2208 (E\n\u2217)+R\u2217 . Thus let us consider ai /\u2208 E\n\u2217. Then, by the above observations, there exists a b\u0304\u25e6i such that b\u0304\u25e6i  ai and E\n\u2217 6 b\u0304\u25e6i . Using the latter and the induction hypothesis (iv) we obtain that b\u0304\u25e6i \u2208 E \u2217. Now we have that E\u2217  ai, hence ai \u2208 (E \u2217)+R\u2217 and we obtain (iii).\n(2) Now let us assume that (i) and (iii) hold for all an\u22121. We have that F n\u22121 F (\u2205)  a\niff there exists b \u2208 Fn\u22121F (\u2205) \u2229 {b | (b, a) \u2208 R \u2217}. By induction hypothesis this holds iff\nthere exists a bi\u22121 \u2208 E \u2217 such that (b, a) \u2208 R. In other words there exists bi\u22121 \u2208 E \u2217 such that bi\u22121  R\u2217 a\u0304\u25e6i , which implies that a\u0304 \u25e6 i 6\u2208 E \u2217. Moreover if there is no bi\u22121 \u2208 E \u2217 such that bi\u22121  R\u2217 a\u0304\u25e6i , by assumption (iii) we have that E\n\u2217 defends a\u0304\u25e6i and thus a\u0304\u25e6i \u2208 E \u2217. Hence (ii) and (iv) hold.\nFurthermore when applying the FF operator we either add a new argument to the set and attack an additional argument or we reach the fixed-point. So in each step we make a decision about at least two arguments and thus F lF (\u2205) = grd(F ). In combination with (i), we get that al \u2208 E\n\u2217 iff a \u2208 grd(F ). Moreover by (iii) and (iv) it holds that E\u2217 is also a stable extension and thus grd(F \u2217) = stb(F \u2217) = com(F \u2217) = prf (F \u2217) = sem(F \u2217) = stg(F \u2217).\nAs in Tr8 the integer value l depends on the size S of the source AF, Tr8 is not modular. However, it can be verified that the computation of the translation only requires logarithmic space wrt. S and that Tr8 is embedding (the original AF is indeed contained in the resulting AF; see also the bottom layer in Figure 11(b)). Our final result concerning translations thus follows immediately from Lemma 9.\nTheorem 8. Tr8 is an embedding and faithful translation for grd \u21d2 \u03c3 (\u03c3 \u2208 {stb, com, prf , stg , sem})."}, {"heading": "5. Negative Results", "text": "In this section, we present results fortifying that for several semantics there does not exist any translation with the desired properties. The first result, which is rather straight forward, relies on the fact that the grounded semantics is a unique-status semantics.\nProposition 3. There is no (weakly) faithful translation for \u03c3 \u21d2 grd with \u03c3 \u2208 {sem, stg , prf , com, stb, adm}.\nProof. For instance consider the AF F = ({a, b}, {(a, b), (b, a)}). We have that {{a}, {b}} \u2286 \u03c3(F ) for \u03c3 \u2208 {sem, stg , prf , com, stb, adm} but the grounded semantics always proposes a unique extension.\nWe observe that in general it holds that if \u03c3 is a multiple status semantics and \u03c3\u2032 is a unique status semantics then there is no (weakly) faithful translation for \u03c3 \u21d2 \u03c3\u2032.\nFurther results are based on complexity gaps between different semantics (see Table 1) and the fact that certain translations preserve some decision problem. We start with cases where it is impossible to find efficient faithful translations; even if we allow for weakly faithful translations, cf. Definition 6. Afterwards, we give some negative results concerning (weakly) exact translations.\nThe following theorem concerns the intertranslatability of preferred, semi-stable and stage semantics, i.e. the semantics where skeptical acceptance is \u03a0P2 -complete. The underlying reason for the impossibility result is the complexity gap for the credulous acceptance problems.\nTheorem 9. There is no efficient (weakly) faithful translation for sem \u21d2 prf or stg \u21d2 prf unless \u03a3P2 = NP.\nProof. Let Tr be an efficient (weakly) faithful translation from \u03c3 \u2208 {sem, stg} to prf . By definition this translation is L-computable and as we show next reduces Cred\u03c3 to Credprf : Let F = (A, R) be an arbitrary AF, x \u2208 A an argument. First let us assume that x is credulously accepted wrt. to \u03c3. Hence, there exists an E \u2208 \u03c3(F ) with x \u2208 E. As Tr is a weakly faithful translation, there is an E\u2217 \u2208 prf (Tr (F )), such that E\u2217 \u2229 A = E. Thus x \u2208 E\u2217, i.e. x is credulously accepted wrt. preferred semantics in Tr (F ).\nSo assume x is credulously accepted in Tr (F ) wrt. to prf , i.e. x \u2208 E\u2217 for some E\u2217 \u2208 prf (Tr (F )). By x \u2208 E\u2217\u2229A we can conclude that E\u2217 is not a remainder set of Tr . As Tr is a weakly faithful translation we have that E = E\u2217 \u2229A is in \u03c3(F ), and thus x is credulously accepted in F wrt. \u03c3. Thus, Tr is a L-reduction from the \u03a3P2 -hard problem Cred\u03c3 to the NP-easy problem Credprf .\nThe following theorem makes use of complexity gaps for the skeptical acceptance.\nTheorem 10. There is no efficient (weakly) faithful translation for \u03c3 \u21d2 \u03c3\u2032, where \u03c3 \u2208 {sem, stg , prf } and \u03c3\u2032 \u2208 {com, stb, adm}, unless \u03a3P2 = NP.\nProof. Given an efficient weakly faithful translation Tr with remainder set S for \u03c3 \u21d2 \u03c3\u2032 we have that Skept\u03c3 is translated to the problem Skept S \u03c3\u2032 , that is deciding whether an argument is in each \u03c3\u2032-extension which is not in the set S. Next we show that the problem SkeptS\u03c3\u2032 remains in coNP. One can disprove SkeptS\u03c3\u2032 , by guessing a set E \u2286 A, such that a 6\u2208 E and verify that E \u2208 \u03c3\u2032(F ) and E 6\u2208 S. As Ver\u03c3\u2032 \u2208 P and the set S is fixed, i.e. S does not depend on the input, this is an NP-algorithm. Hence proving SkeptS\u03c3\u2032 is in coNP. Thus Tr would be an L-reduction from the \u03a0P2 -hard problem Skept\u03c3 to the coNP-easy problem SkeptS\u03c3\u2032 , which implies \u03a3 P 2 = NP.\nOne might prefer (weakly) exact over (weakly) faithful translations. As we have seen in Section 4, several of our translations are not exact but only faithful. In these cases we are interested in either finding an exact translation or an evidence that an exact translation is not possible. The following theorems approve that it was appropriate to have given only a (weakly) faithful translation in Section 4, as there cannot be any exact such translation.\nTheorem 11. There is no (weakly) exact translation for \u03c3 \u21d2 \u03c3\u2032 where \u03c3 \u2208 {adm, com} and \u03c3\u2032 \u2208 {stb, prf , sem, stg}.\nProof. This is basically by the fact that admissible resp. complete extensions may be in a \u2282-relation; consider e.g. F = ({a, b}, {(a, b), (b, a)}) with \u03c3(F ) = {{a}, {b}, \u2205}. Let us now assume there exists a (weakly) exact translation Tr for \u03c3 \u21d2 \u03c3\u2032. By definition, \u03c3(F ) = {{a}, {b}, \u2205} \u2286 \u03c3\u2032(Tr (F )), but as \u2205 \u2282 {a} this contradicts \u03c3\u2032 \u2208 {stb, prf , sem, stg}.\nTheorem 12. There is no (weakly) exact translation for com \u21d2 adm.\nProof. We observe that for every AF F it holds that \u2205 \u2208 adm(F ), but there are AFs where \u2205 /\u2208 com(F ). Thus for a weakly exact translation Tr , with the collection S of remainder sets, it holds that \u2205 \u2208 S. But then, given an AF F with \u2205 \u2208 com(F ), e.g. F = ({a, b}, {(a, b), (b, a)}), we can conclude that \u2205 \u2208 adm(Tr (F )) \\ S, a contradiction.\nTheorem 13. There is no efficient (weakly) exact translation for grd \u21d2 \u03c3 where \u03c3 \u2208 {stb, adm, com}, unless L = P.\nProof. Let us, towards a contradiction, assume that there exists an efficient (weakly) exact translation Tr for grd \u21d2 \u03c3. For a given AF F = (A, R) with a set E \u2286 A it holds that E \u2208 grd(F ) iff E \u2208 \u03c3(Tr (F )). Thus Tr would be an L-reduction from the P-hard problem Vergrd (see Proposition 1) to Ver\u03c3 (\u03c3 \u2208 {stb, adm, com}) which is in L.\nIn Section 4 we presented two translations for stg \u21d2 sem: Tr2 which is an exact translation, but not embedding, and Tr5 which is an embedding and faithful translation, but not exact. Let us also mention at this point that Tr2 was the only translation presented in Section 4 that is not embedding. Hence a natural question that occurs is whether a translation that is embedding and exact for stg \u21d2 sem is possible. We give a negative answer to this question.\nTheorem 14. There is no embedding and (weakly) exact translation for stg \u21d2 sem.\nProof. Let us assume there exists an embedding and (weakly) exact translation Tr for stg \u21d2 sem. Consider the AF F = ({a, b}, {(a, a), (a, b)}) with stg(F ) = {{b}}. As Tr is a (weakly) exact translation we have that {b} \u2208 sem(Tr (F )) and thus {b} \u2208 adm(Tr (F )). Further we have that (a, b) \u2208 RTr (F ) (Tr (F ) is embedding) and thus {b} must attack a. But then we have (b, a) \u2208 RTr (F ) which is contradiction to Tr being an embedding translation.\nFinally we present an impossibility result for prf \u21d2 stg and sem \u21d2 stg .\nTheorem 15. There is no (weakly) exact translation for \u03c3 \u21d2 stg (\u03c3 \u2208 {sem, prf }).\nProof. Consider the AF F = ({a, b, c, d, e, f, g1, g2, h}, {(g1, g1), (g2, g2), (a, b), (b, a), (c, d), (d, c), (a, g1), (b, e), (c, e), (d, g2), (e, f), (f, h), (h, e)}) illustrated in Figure 12. We have that sem(F ) = {{b, d, f}, {a, c, f}, {a, d}} and prf (F ) = sem(F ) \u222a {{b, c, f}}.\nTo prove that there is no weakly exact translation for \u03c3 \u21d2 stg (\u03c3 \u2208 {sem, prf }), we will show that there exists no AF F \u2032 with sem(F ) \u2286 stg(F \u2032). To this end, let us assume that F \u2032 = (A\u2032, R\u2032) is such an AF with {{b, d, f}, {a, c, f}, {a, d}} \u2286 stg(F \u2032). Using the fact that {b, d, f} is conflict-free in F \u2032 we obtain that (d, f), (f, d) 6\u2208 R\u2032 and similar by using that {a, c, f} is conflict-free in F \u2032 we get that (a, f), (f, a) 6\u2208 R\u2032. By assumption {a, d} \u2208 stg(F \u2032) and thus {a, d} is a maximal conflict-free set of F \u2032, but by the above observations the set {a, d, f} is also conflict-free in F \u2032, a contradiction."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "In this work, we investigated intertranslations between different semantics for abstract argumentation. We focused on translations which are efficiently computable and faithful (with a few relaxations due to certain differences implicit to the semantics). An overview of our results is given in Table 2.3 The entry in row \u03c3 and column \u03c3\u2032 is to read as follows: \u201c\u2013\u201d states that we have shown (Section 5) that no efficient faithful (even weakly faithful) translation for \u03c3 \u21d2 \u03c3\u2032 exists. If the entry refers to a translation (or a concatenation of translations), we have found an efficient (weakly) exact translation for \u03c3 \u21d2 \u03c3\u2032. An entry which is split into two parts, e.g. \u201cTr8 / -\u201d, means that we have found an efficient (weakly) faithful translation, but there is no such exact translation. \u201c?\u201d indicates an open problem. We mention that all the concatenated translations are weakly faithful as they are built from a weakly exact translation Tr4 (which has as only remainder set the empty set) and a faithful translation (either Tr6, Tr7, or Tr8).\nFigure 13 illustrates our intertranslatability results at one glance. Here, a solid arrow expresses that there is an efficient faithful translation while a dotted arrow depicts that there may exist such a translation, but so far we have neither found one nor have an argument against its existence. Furthermore, if for two semantics \u03c3, \u03c3\u2032 there is no path from \u03c3 to \u03c3\u2032 then it is proven (partly under typical complexity theoretical assumptions) that there is no efficient faithful translation for \u03c3 \u21d2 \u03c3\u2032. If we consider the relations between the semantics wrt. exactness rather than just faithfulness, the overall picture changes; see Figure 14. Here, we get a more detailed picture about the relations between stable, admissible, and complete semantics. One conclusion, we can draw from these pictures is that semi-stable semantics is the most expressive one, since each of the other investigated semantics can be efficiently embedded. Moreover, we believe that our investigations complements recent results about comparisons between the different semantics proposed for argumentation frameworks.\nLet us at this point also mention that, instead of considering different properties for the translations, we could also have used slightly revised semantics. The notion of remainder sets (as given in Definition 6) can partly be circumvented by, for instance, using a quasiadmissible semantics instead of admissible semantics, where the quasi-admissible extensions\n3. One may notice that Tr5 does not appear in the table. Recall that Tr5 was proposed as an alternative to Tr2 satisfying slightly different properties for stg \u21d2 sem; see also the discussion before Theorem 14.\nof an AF are all non-empty admissible extensions (in case such ones exist), or is only the empty set otherwise. Also it is obvious that the more restricted the properties for a translation are, the less such translations exist (compare Figures 13 and 14). Hence, we observe a certain trade-off between translation criteria and comparability between semantics.\nAn alternative option to obtain translations would have been to exploit known relations between argumentation semantics and logic-programming semantics (see, e.g., Dung, 1995; Wu, Caminada, & Gabbay, 2009) and making use of known translatability results for the latter. However, we refrained from such an approach here, since it might blur the minimal requirements for the translations under consideration. In particular, from the point of meta-argumentation, translations via logic-programming semantics might introduce new arguments just for technical reasons due to the logic-programming syntax, but which have no meaning on the level of AFs.\nFor future work, we identify the following tasks: First, we want to solve the few open slots in Table 2. Second, further properties for translations could be of interest. For instance, one could even strengthen the property of being exact (which is defined in terms of the extensions) to the requirement that the labelings (Caminada & Gabbay, 2009) of the source and target framework coincide. Labelings provide additional information, in particular for arguments not contained in an extension. Likewise, it would be interesting to investigate intertranslatability in the more general approach of equational semantics for argumentation frameworks (Gabbay, 2011). Further properties for translations could be given in terms of graph properties. As an example, acyclic AFs should remain acyclic after the translations, or parameters as tree-width should remain unchanged. Requirements of such a form are also termed \u201cstructural preservation\u201d (Janhunen et al., 2006). Such properties are of interest from a computational point of view in the sense that, in case the source AF is easy to evaluate (because of its structure), this advantage should not be lost during the translation; recall here Figure 1 where we suggested to use our translations for a rapid prototyping approach to compute the extensions of a semantics via an argumentation engine based on a different semantics. Finally, we plan to extend our considerations to other important semantics like the ideal semantics (Dung et al., 2007), cf2-semantics (which is proposed among others in Baroni et al., 2005), or resolution-based semantics (Baroni, Dunne, & Giacomin, 2011), among which the resolution-based grounded semantics is of particular interest. As well studying translations between semantics for generalizations of Dung-style AFs as EAFs (Modgil, 2009) or AFRAs (Baroni, Cerutti, et al., 2011) is an interesting subject for future work."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by the Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF) under grant ICT08-028.
