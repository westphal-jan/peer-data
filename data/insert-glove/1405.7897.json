By \u03c0 we denote the natural projection from X to XG . For details we refer to [1,2]. The stabilizer of w \u2208 X is a subgroup defined by\nGw = {\u03b3 \u2208 G : \u03b3w = w} .\nIf Gw is the trivial group, then each element of the orbit [w] has a trivial stabilizer.

The closure of the image \u03c6(XG) is the Dirichlet (fundamental) domain with basepoint (center) w defined by\nDw = { x \u2208 X : wTx \u2265 w\u0303Tx, w\u0303 \u2208 W } .\nA Dirichlet domain is a convex polyhedral cone of dimension dim(X ) with the following properties: (1) Dw is well-defined, (2) x \u2208 Dw iff (x,w) is an optimal alignment, (3) \u03c0(Dw) = XG, and (4) \u03c0 is injective on the interior of Dw [2]."}, {"heading": "3 Auxiliary Results", "text": "Lemma 1. Let \u03c6 : XG \u2192 X be a fundamental cross section with basepoint w. Then \u03b3 \u25e6 \u03c6 is a fundamental cross section with basepoint \u03b3w for all \u03b3 \u2208 G.\nProof. From the axioms of a group action follows that \u03b3 is bijective. A cross section \u03c6 is injective by definition. Then the composition \u03c6\u2032 = \u03b3 \u25e6 \u03c6 is also injective. We show that W \u00b7X = \u03c6\u2032(W )T\u03c6\u2032(X). We have\n\u03c6\u2032(W )T\u03c6\u2032(X) = \u03b3wT\u03b3x,\nwhere w = \u03c6(W ) and x = \u03c6(X). Since G is a permutation group, the mapping \u03b3 is orthogonal. As an orthogonal mapping, \u03b3 preserves the inner product, that is \u03b3wT \u03b3x = wTx. Since \u03c6 is a fundamental cross section with basepoint w, we have\nW \u00b7X = \u03c6(W )T \u03c6(X) = wTx = \u03b3wT\u03b3x = \u03c6\u2032(W )T\u03c6\u2032(X).\nNote that this part also shows that the \u03c6\u2032 is a cross section with basepoint \u03b3w. Finally, we show that \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6\u2032(X) = X for all X \u2208 XG . Since \u03c6 is a fundamental cross section, the vector x = \u03c6(X) projects to X via \u03c0. The graph X can be regarded as the orbit [x] of x. As an element of [x] the vector \u03b3x also projects to X via \u03c0. This shows \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6\u2032(X) = X . \u2293\u2294\nLemma 2. Let \u03c6 : XG \u2192 X be a fundamental cross section with basepoint w and Dirichlet domain Dw. Then w is an interior point of Dw if and only if W = \u03c0(w) is regular.\nProof. Let w be an interior point of Dw. We assume that W is not regular. Then there is a \u03b3 \u2208 G \\ {id} such that w = \u03b3w. According to Lemma 1, the composition \u03c6\u2032 = \u03b3 \u25e6 \u03c6 is a fundamental cross section with basepoint \u03b3w and Dirichlet domain \u03b3Dw = D\u03b3w. From w = \u03b3w follows that\nD = intDw \u2229 int \u03b3Dw 6= \u2205,\nwhere intS denotes the interior of a set S \u2286 X . As an intersection of open convex sets, the setD is also open and convex. Then there are n+1 points x0, . . . ,xn \u2208 D\nin general position, where n = dim(X ). By definition of a Dirichlet domain, we have\nw T xi = w T\u03b3xi\nfor all i \u2208 {0, . . . , n}. This implies xi = \u03b3xi, because cross sections are injective. Observe that G acts isometrically on X . Since two isometries are the same if they coincide on n+ 1 points in general position, we obtain \u03b3 = id. This contradicts our assumption that there is a \u03b3 6= id such that w = \u03b3w. Hence, W is regular.\nNow we assume that W is regular and show that there is a representation w of W such that w \u2208 intDw. The boundary of Dw is of the form\nbdDw = \u22c3\n\u03b3\u2208G\\{id}\nDw \u2229 \u03b3Dw.\nSince W is regular, \u03b3w 6= w for all \u03b3 \u2208 G \\ {id}\nSuppose that w\u0303 6= w is another representation of W with Dirichlet domain Dw\u0303. The bisection of Dw and Dw\u0303 is defined by the set\nH(w, w\u0303) = { x \u2208 D : wTx = w\u0303Tx } ,\nwhere D = Dw \u2229 Dw\u0303. Since w and w\u0303 are unequal, H(w,w \u2032) is a subset of a hyperplane H defined by the equation h(x) = (w\u2212 w\u0303)Tx. The hyperplane H is perpendicular to the vector v = w \u2212 w\u0303 and passes through the midpoint of the connecting line between w and w\u0303. This shows that w is not a point on H(w, w\u0303). Since w\u0303 was chosen arbitrarily, w is in the interior of Dw. \u2293\u2294\nLemma 3. Let W \u2208 XG be regular. Suppose that \u03c6 is a fundamental cross section with basepoint w and Dirichlet domain Dw. Then \u2212w /\u2208 Dw.\nProof. Observe that w 6= 0 and w 6= \u2212w for all representations w of a regular graph W . In addition, with W the graph W \u2032 = \u03c0(\u2212w) is also regular. As shown in [1], we have\nW \u00b7W = max \u03b3\u2208G\n\u03b3wTw = wTw. (1)\nLet W \u2032 be the graph represented by \u2212w. From eq. (1) follows\n\u2212wTw = \u2212min \u03b3 \u03b3wTw < max \u03b3 \u2212wTw = W \u2032 \u00b7W (2)\nStrict inequality in eq. (2) follows from regularity of W and W \u2032 together with w 6= \u2212w. Thus, \u2212w is not an element of the Dirichlet domainDw with basepoint w. \u2293\u2294\nProof of Theorem 1\nSuppose that each graph X \u2208 XG has a class label y \u2208 Y = {\u00b11}. By C[f ] we denote the expected misclassification error of the sublinear function f . Consider a sublinear function of the form f(X) = W \u00b7 X + b, where W is regular and b 6= 0. The equation f(X) = 0 defines a decision surface Hf that separates the graph space XG into two disjoint regions R+(f) and R\u2212(f). By construction we have C[f ] = 0.\nLet \u03c6 be a fundamental cross section with basepoint w = \u03c6(W ) and Dirichlet domain Dw. By D+(f) = \u03c6(R+(f)) and D\u2212(f) = \u03c6(R\u2212(f)) we denote the images of both class regions R+(f) and R\u2212(f) in Dw. The hyperplane separating D+(f) and D\u2212(f) is defined by the equation h(x) = wTx+ b = 0. By construction, the expected misclassification error of h(x) is CX [h] = 0. In addition, h(x) is the unique global minimum of CX [\u00b7] over all linear functions.\nNow we relabel both class regions R+(f) and R\u2212(f) such that all graphs from the positive class region R+(f) have negative labels and all graphs from the negative class region R\u2212(f) have positive labels. We denote the relabeled regions in XG by R+(f) and R\u2212(f), resp., and similarly the relabeled regions in Dw by D+(f) and D\u2212(f). For the relabeled variant, the linear classifier in Dw determined by h\u2032(x) = \u2212wTx + b has also minimal misclassification error CX [h\n\u2032] = 0 and is the unique minimizer of CX [\u00b7]. By Lemma 3 the opposite direction \u2212w of basepoint w is not an element of the Dirichlet domain Dw.\nSuppose that f \u2032(X) = W \u2032 \u00b7X + b\u2032 is a sublinear function such that\nC[f \u2032] = min g C[g]\nunder the relabeled setting with class regionsR+(f) andR\u2212(f). Let w\u2032 = \u03c6(W \u2032) be a representation of W \u2032 in Dw and let \u03c6\u2032 be a fundamental cross section with basepoint w\u2032 = \u03c6\u2032(W \u2032) and Dirichlet domain Dw\u2032 . We consider the intersection D = Dw \u2229 Dw\u2032 . According to [3], Theorem 12, the intersection of two convex polyhedral cones is again a convex polyhedral cone. We show that D has codimension 0. For this, we first show that the relative interior of the intersection D contains an inner point z from Dw. Since W is regular, w is an inner point of Dw lying in D. Two cases can occur: (i) w is in the relative interior of D; and (ii) w lies on the boundary of D. If (i) holds, we set z = w. Suppose that (ii) holds. Since w and w\u2032 are distinct elements of the intersection D, any point z = \u03bbw+(1\u2212\u03bb)w\u2032 with 0 < \u03bb < 1 lies in the relative interior of D by convexity.\nNext we show that there is an \u03b5 > 0 such that the open ball B(z, \u03b5) with center z and radius \u03b5 is contained in D. We choose \u03b5 < min(\u03bb, 1 \u2212 \u03bb). Then B(z, \u03b5) \u2282 Dw, because z is an interior point of Dw. Suppose that B(z, \u03b5) is not contained in D. Since z lies in the relative interior of D, the co-dimension of D is positive. In addition, z lies on the boundary of Dw\u2032 . This implies that z is also a boundary point of Dw, which is a contradiction of our construction. Hence, the co-dimension of D is zero.\nSince b 6= 0, the hyperplane defined by equation h(x) = wTx + b = 0 does not pass through the origin 0. Boundaries of any Dirichlet domain are\nV supported by hyperplanes passing through 0. Thus the intersection D contains an open set U separated by the hyperplane segment Hf . Then there are n + 1 points x0, . . . ,xn \u2208 D in general position that fix the unique hyperplane. Since \u2212w /\u2208 Dw, we have C[f \u2032] > 0 implying that f \u2032 is not a dual of f .\nThe probabilistic statement follows from the fact that interior points are regular and therefore have Lebesgue measure one. With respect to the bias b, the set R \\ {0} also has Lebesgue measure one. Combining all parts we arrive at the assertion. \u2293\u2294"}], "references": [{"title": "Structure Spaces", "author": ["B. Jain", "K.
