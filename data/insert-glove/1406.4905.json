[3]). State-space models generalize other popular time series models such as linear and nonlinear auto-regressive models: (N)ARX, (N)ARMA, (G)ARCH, etc. [21].\nIn this article we focus on Bayesian learning of nonparametric nonlinear state-space models. In particular, we use sparse Gaussian processes (GPs) [19] as a convenient method to encode general assumptions about the dynamical system such as continuity or smoothness. In contrast to conventional parametric methods, we allow the user to easily trade off model capacity and computation time. Moreover, we present a variational training procedure that allows very complex models to be learned without risk of overfitting.\nOur variational formulation leads to a tractable approximate posterior over nonlinear dynamical systems. This approximate posterior can be used to compute fast probabilistic predictions of future trajectories of the dynamical system. The computational complexity of our learning approach is linear in the length of the time series. This is possible thanks to the use of variational sparse GPs [22] which lead to a smoothing problem for the latent state trajectory in a simpler auxiliary dynamical system. Smoothing in this auxiliary system can be carried out with any conventional technique (e.g. sequential Monte Carlo). In addition, we present a stochastic variational inference procedure [10] to accelerate learning for long time series and we also present an online learning scheme.\nThis work is useful in situations where: 1) it is important to know how uncertain future predictions are, 2) there is not enough knowledge about the underlying nonlinear dynamical system to create a principled parametric model, and 3) it is necessary to have an explicit model that can be used to simulate the dynamical system into the future. These conditions arise often in engineering and finance. For instance, consider an autonomous aircraft adapting its flight control when carrying a large external load of unknown weight and aerodynamic characteristics. A model of the nonlinear dynamics of the new system can be very useful in order to automatically adapt the control strategy. When few data points are available, there is high uncertainty about the dynamics.

Ghahramani and Roweis [9] presented a maximum likelihood approach to learn nonlinear SSMs based on radial basis functions. This work was later extended by using a parameterized Gaussian process point of view and developing tailored filtering algorithms [6, 7, 23]. Approximate Bayesian learning has also been developed for parameterized nonlinear SSMs [5, 24].\nWang et al. [25] modeled the nonlinear functions in SSMs using Gaussian processes (GP-SSMs) and found a MAP estimate of the latent variables and hyperparameters. Their approach preserved the nonparametric properties of Gaussian processes. Despite using MAP learning over state trajectories, overfitting was not an issue since it was applied in a dimensionality reduction context where the latent space of the SSM was much smaller than the observation space. In a similar vein, [4, 12] presented a hierarchical Gaussian process model that could model linear dynamics and nonlinear mappings from latent states to observations. More recently, Frigola et al. [8] learned GP-SSMs in a fully Bayesian manner by employing particle MCMC methods to sample from the smoothing distribution. However, their approach led to predictions with a computational cost proportional to the length of the time series.\nIn the rest of this article, we present an approach to variational Bayesian learning of flexible nonlinear state-space models which leads to a simple representation of the posterior over nonlinear dynamical systems and results in predictions having a low computational complexity."}, {"heading": "2 Gaussian Process State-Space Models", "text": "We consider discrete-time nonlinear state-space models built with deterministic functions and additive noise\nxt+1 = f(xt) + vt, (1a) yt = g(xt) + et. (1b)\nThe dynamics of the system are defined by the state transition function f(xt) and independent additive noise vt (process noise). The states xt \u2208 RD are latent variables such that all future variables are conditionally independent on the past given the present state. Observations yt \u2208 RE are linked to the state via another deterministic function g(xt) and independent additive noise et (observation noise). State-space models are stochastic dynamical processes that are useful to model time series y , {y1, ...,yT }. The deterministic functions in (1) can also take external known inputs (such as control signals) as an argument but, for conciseness, we will omit those in our notation.\nA traditional approach to learn f and g is to restrict them to a family of parametric functions. This is particularly appropriate when the dynamical system is very well understood, e.g. orbital mechanics of a spacecraft. However, in many applications, it is difficult to specify a class of parametric models that can provide both the ability to model complex functions and resistance to overfitting thanks to an easy to specify prior or regularizer. Gaussian processes do have these properties: they can represent functions of arbitrary complexity and provide a straightforward way to specify assumptions about those unknown functions, e.g. smoothness. In the light of this, it is natural to place Gaussian process priors over both f and g [25]. However, the extreme flexibility of the two Gaussian processes leads to severe nonidentifiability and strong correlations between the posteriors of the two unknown functions. In the rest of this paper we will focus on a model with a GP prior over the transition function and a parametric likelihood. However, our variational formulation can also be applied to the double GP case (see supplementary material).\nA probabilistic state-space model with a Gaussian process prior over the transition function and a parametric likelihood is specified by\nf(x) \u223c GP ( mf (x), kf (x,x \u2032) ) , (2a)\nxt | ft \u223c N (xt | ft,Q), (2b) x0 \u223c p(x0) (2c)\nyt | xt \u223c p(yt | xt,\u03b8y), (2d) where we have used ft , f(xt\u22121). Since f(x) \u2208 RD, we use the convention that the covariance function kf returns a D\u00d7D matrix. We group all hyperparameters into \u03b8 , {\u03b8f ,\u03b8y,Q}. Note that\nwe are not restricting the likelihood (2d) to any particular form. The joint distribution of a GP-SSM is\np(y,x, f) = p(x0) T\u220f t=1 p(yt|xt)p(xt|ft)p(ft|f1:t\u22121,x0:t\u22121), (3)\nwhere we use the convention f1:0 = \u2205 and omit the conditioning on \u03b8 in the notation. The GP on the transition function induces a distribution over the latent function values with the form of a GP predictive:\np(ft|f1:t\u22121,x0:t\u22121) = N ( mf (xt\u22121) + Kt\u22121,0:t\u22122K \u22121 0:t\u22122,0:t\u22122(f1:t\u22121 \u2212mf (x0:t\u22122)),\nKt\u22121,t\u22121 \u2212Kt\u22121,0:t\u22122K\u221210:t\u22122,0:t\u22122K>t\u22121,0:t\u22122 ) , (4)\nwhere the subindices of the kernel matrices indicate the arguments to the covariance function necessary to build each matrix, e.g. Kt\u22121,0:t\u22122 = [kf (xt\u22121,x0) . . . kf (xt\u22121,xt\u22122)]. When t = 1, the distribution is that of a GP marginal p(f1|x0) = N (mf (x0), kf (x0,x0)). Equation (3) provides a sequential procedure to sample state trajectories and observations. GPSSMs are doubly stochastic models in the sense that one could, at least notionally, first sample a state transition dynamics function from eq. (2a) and then, conditioned on that function, sample the state trajectory and observations.\nGP-SSMs are a very rich prior over nonlinear dynamical systems. In Fig. 1 we illustrate this concept by showing state trajectories sampled from a GP-SSM with fixed hyperparameters. The dynamical systems associated with each of these trajectories are qualitatively very different from each other. For instance, the leftmost panel shows the dynamics of an almost linear non-oscillatory system whereas the rightmost panel corresponds to a limit cycle in a nonlinear system. Our goal in this paper is to use this prior over dynamical systems and obtain a tractable approximation to the posterior over dynamical systems given the data."}, {"heading": "3 Variational Inference in GP-SSMs", "text": "Since the GP-SSM is a nonparametric model, in order to define a posterior distribution over f(x) and make probabilistic predictions it is necessary to first find the smoothing distribution p(x0:T |y1:T ). Frigola et al. [8] obtained samples from the smoothing distribution that could be used to define a predictive density via Monte Carlo integration. This approach is expensive since it requires averaging over L state trajectory samples of length T . In this section we present an alternative approach that aims to find a tractable distribution over the state transition function that is independent of the length of the time series. We achieve this by using variational sparse GP techniques [22]."}, {"heading": "3.1 Augmenting the Model with Inducing Variables", "text": "As a first step to perform variational inference in a GP-SSM, we augment the model withM inducing points u , {ui}Mi=1.

There are various existing strategies to find the smoothing distribution which could be used depending on the characteristics of each particular problem [20]. For instance, in a mildly nonlinear system with Gaussian noise, an extended Kalman smoother can have very good performance. On the other hand, problems with severe nonlinearities and/or non-Gaussian likelihoods can lead to heavily multimodal smoothing distributions that are better represented using particle methods. We note that the application of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) is particularly straightforward in the present auxiliary model."}, {"heading": "3.5 Optimizing the Evidence Lower Bound", "text": "Algorithm 1 presents a procedure to maximize the evidence lower bound by alternatively sampling from the smoothing distribution and taking steps both in \u03b8 and in the natural parameters of q\u2217(u). We propose a hybrid variational-sampling approach whereby approximate samples from q\u2217(x) are obtained with a sequential Monte Carlo smoother. However, as discussed in section 3.4, depending on the characteristics of the dynamical system, other smoothing methods could be more appropriate [20]. As an alternative to smoothing on the auxiliary dynamical system in (12), one could force a q(x) from a particular family of distributions and optimise the evidence lower bound with respect to its variational parameters. For instance, we could posit a Gaussian q(x) with a sparsity pattern in the covariance matrix assuming zero covariance between non-neighboring states and maximize the ELBO with respect to the variational parameters.\nWe use stochastic gradient descent [10] to maximize the ELBO (where we have plugged in the optimal q\u2217(u) [22]) by using its gradient with respect to the hyperparameters. Both quantities are stochastic in our hybrid approach due to variance introduced by the sampling of q\u2217(x). In fact, vanilla sequential Monte Carlo methods will result in biased estimators of the gradient and the parameters of q\u2217(u). However, in our experiments this has not been an issue.

The reported SVI performance has been obtained with mini-batches of 100 time-steps."}, {"heading": "6.2 Neural Spike Train Recordings", "text": "We now turn to the use of SSMs to learn a simple model of neural activity in rats\u2019 hippocampus. We use data in neuron cluster 1 (the most active) from experiment ec013.717 in [14]. In some regions of the time series, the action potential spikes show a clear pattern where periods of rapid spiking are followed by periods of very little spiking. We wish to model this behaviour as an autonomous nonlinear dynamical system (i.e. one not driven by external inputs). Many parametric models of nonlinear neuron dynamics have been proposed [11] but our goal here is to learn a model from data\nwithout using any biological insight. We use a GP-SSM with a structure such that it is the discretetime analog of a second order nonlinear ordinary differential equation: two states one of which is the derivative of the other. The observations are spike counts in temporal bins of 0.01 second width. We use a Poisson likelihood relating the spike counts to the second latent state yt|xt \u223c Poisson(exp(\u03b1x\n(2) t + \u03b2)).\nWe find a posterior distribution for the state transition function using our variational GP-SSM approach. Smoothing is done with a fixed-lag particle smoother and training until convergence takes approximately 50 iterations of Algorithm 1. Figure 2 shows a part of the raw data together with an approximate sample from the smoothing distribution during the same time interval. In addition, we show the distribution over predictions made by chaining 1-step-ahead predictions. To make those predictions we have switched off process noise (Q = 0) to show more clearly the effect of uncertainty in the state transition function. Note how the frequency of roughly 6 Hz present in the data is well captured. Figure 3 shows how the limit cycle corresponding to a nonlinear dynamical system has been captured (see caption for details)."}, {"heading": "7 Discussion and Future Work", "text": "We have derived a tractable variational formulation to learn GP-SSMs: an important class of models of nonlinear dynamical systems that is particularly suited to applications where a principled parametric model of the dynamics is not available. Our approach makes it possible to learn very expressive models without risk of overfitting. In contrast to previous approaches [4, 12, 25], we have demonstrated the ability to learn a nonlinear state transition function in a latent space of greater dimensionality than the observation space. More crucially, our approach yields a tractable posterior over nonlinear systems that, as opposed to those based on sampling from the smoothing distribution [8], results in a computation time for the predictions that does not depend on the length of the time series.\nGiven the interesting capabilities of variational GP-SSMs, we believe that future work is warranted. In particular, we want to focus on structured variational distributions q(x) that could eliminate the need to solve the smoothing problem in the auxiliary dynamical system at the cost of having more variational parameters to optimize. On a more theoretical side, we would like to better characterize GP-SSM priors in terms of their dynamical system properties: stability, equilibria, limit cycles, etc."}, {"heading": "B Relationship of Variational Approximation with Other Models", "text": "B.1 Markovian Model with Heteroscedastic Noise\nAlthough not strictly a GP-SSM, it is also interesting to consider a model where the state transitions are independent of each other given the inducing variables\np(f1:T ,x0:T |u) = p(x0) T\u220f t=1 N ( ft|At\u22121u,Bt\u22121 ) p(xt|ft). (21)\nThis model can be interpreted as a parametric model where At\u22121u is a deterministic transition function and Bt\u22121 provides the description of an heteroscedastic process noise. Note that this process noise is independent between any two time steps.\nIf we look for an evidence lower bound with using an analogous procedure to that of section 3 and the following variational distribution\nq(x, f ,u) = q(u)q(x) T\u220f t=1 N ( ft|At\u22121u,Bt\u22121 ) , (22)\nthe lower bound becomes the same as the one in equation (9).\nB.2 Bayesian RBF Model\nThe Radial Basis Function in this model uses a deterministic state transition function of the form f(x) = A(x) u which leads to\np(f1:T ,x0:T |u) = p(x0) T\u220f t=1 N ( ft|At\u22121 u,0 ) p(xt|ft). (23)\nAs opposed to the model in B.1, this transition dynamics is not heteroscedastic. It is fully deterministic and parameterized by u and z. From a GP perspective, this model is analogous to the Subset of Regressors sparse GP [18]. This model has the undesirable characteristic that the predictive variance shrinks to zero away from the inducing inputs when exactly the opposite behaviour would be desirable.\nB.3 Double GP Model\nA state space model having a Gaussian process prior over the state transition function and the emission/observation function can be represented by\nf(x) \u223c GP ( mf (x), kf (x,x \u2032) ) , (24a)\ng(x) \u223c GP ( mg(x), kg(x,x \u2032) ) , (24b)\nx0 \u223c p(x0) (24c) xt | ft \u223c N (xt | ft,Q), (24d) yt | gt \u223c N (yt | gt,R), (24e)\nwhere we have used ft , f(xt\u22121) and gt , g(xt). If the transition GP is augmented with inducing variables u and the emission GP is augmented with v, we obtain the following joint distribution of the model\np(y,x, f ,u,g,v) = p(g|x,v) p(x, f |u) p(u) p(v) T\u220f t=1 p(yt|gt), (25)\nwhere p(x, f |u) is the same as in the model presented in the paper and p(g|x,v) is straightforward since it is conditioned on all the states.\nWe use the following variational distribution over latent variables\nq(x, f ,u,g,v) = q(u)q(v)q(x)p(g|x,v) T\u220f t=1 p(ft|f1:t\u22121,x0:t\u22121,u).
