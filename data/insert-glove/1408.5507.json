These soft neutrosophic algebraic structures are\nbasically defined over the neutrosophic algebraic structures which\nmeans a parameterized collection of subsets of the neutrosophic\nalgebraic structure. For instance , the existence of a soft neutrosophic\ngroup over a neutrosophic group or a soft neutrosophic semigroup over a\nneutrosophic semigroup, or a soft neutrosophic field over a neutrosophic\nfield, or a soft neutrosophic LA-semigroup over a neutrosophic LA-\nsemigroup, or a soft neutosophic loop over a neutrosophic loop. It is\ninteresting to note that these notions are defined over finite and infinite\nneutrosophic algebraic structures. These structures are even bigger than\nthe classical algebraic structures.\nThis book contains five chapters. Chapter one is about the\nintroductory concepts. In chapter two the notions of soft neutrosophic\ngroup, soft neutrosophic bigroup and soft neutrosophic N-group are\nintroduced and many fantastic properties are given with illustrative\nexamples. Soft neutrosophic semigroup, soft neutrosophic bisemigroup\nand soft neutrosophic N-semigroup are placed in the second chapter with\nrelated properties. The chapter three is about soft neutrosophic loop with\nsoft neutrosophic biloop and soft neutrosophic N-loop.

Neutrosophic groups\nareeven bigger algebraic structures than groups with some kind of\nindeterminacy factor. Now we proceed to define a neutrosophic group.\nDefinition 1.1.1: Let ( , )G be any group and let\n{ : , }G I a bI a b G . Then the neutrosophic group is generated by\nI and G under denoted by ( ) { , }N G G I . I is called the neutrosophic element with the property 2I I . For an integer n , n I and nI are neutrosophic elements and 0. 0I .\n1 I , the inverse of I is not defined and hence does not exist.\nTheorem 1.1.1: Let ( )N G be a neutrosophic group.

If every strong neutrosophic\nsubbigroup of G I is a Lagrange strong neutrosophic subbigroup then\nwe call G I a Lagrange strong neutrosophic bigroup.\nDefinition 1.1.25: If the strong neutrosophic bigroup has at least one Lagrange strong neutrosophic subbigroup then we call G I\na weakly Lagrange strong neutrosophic bigroup.\nDefinition 1.1.26: If G I has no Lagrange strong neutrosophic\nsubbigroup then we call G I a Lagrange free strong neutrosophic\nbigroup.\nDefinition 1.1.27: Let  , ,G I  be a strong neutrosophic bigroup\nwith 1 2G I G I G I     . Let  , ,H  be a neutrosophic subbigroup where 1 2H H H  .

We say two neutrosophic strong subbigroups 1 2H H H  and 1 2K K K  are conjugate neutrosophic subbigroups of 1 2G I G I G I     if 1H is conjugate to 1K and 2H is conjugate to 2K as neutrosophic subgroups of\n1G I and 1G I respectively.\nDefinition 1.1.29: Let  1, ,..., NG I   be a nonempty set with N -binary operations defined on it. We say G I is a strong neutrosophic N -\ngroup if the following conditions are true.\n1) 1 2 ... NG I G I G I G I        where iG I are proper subsets of\nG I .\n2)  ,i iG I  is a neutrosophic group, 1,2,...,i N .\n3) If in the above definition we have\na. 1 2 1... ...k k NG I G G I G I G I G           b.  ,i iG  is a group for some i or\n4)  ,j jG I  is a neutrosophic group for some j . Then we call G I\nto be a neutrosophic N -group.\nExample 1.1.8: Let  1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4, , , ,G I G I G I G I G I             be a neutrosophic 4 -group where  1 1,2,3,4, ,2 ,3 ,4G I I I I I  neutrosophic group under multiplication modulo 5 .\n 2 0,1,2, ,2 ,1 ,2 ,1 2 ,2 2G I I I I I I I      a neutrosophic group under\nmultiplication modulo 3 , 3G I Z I   , a neutrosophic group under addition and     4 , : , 1, ,4,4G I a b a b I I   , component-wise multiplication modulo 5 . Hence G I is a strong neutrosophic 4 -group.\nExample 1.1.9: Let  1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4, , , ,G I G I G I G G           be a neutrosophic 4 -group, where  1 1,2,3,4, ,2 ,3 ,4G I I I I I  a neutrosophic group under multiplication modulo 5 .  2 0,1, ,1G I I I   ,a neutrosophic group under multiplication modulo 2 . 3 3G S and 4 5G A , the alternating group.

It is important to note  , iP  for no i is a neutrosophic group.\nThus we see a strong neutrosophic N -group can have 3 types of\nsubgroups viz.\n1. Strong neutrosophic sub N -groups. 2. Neutrosophic sub N -groups. 3. Sub N -groups.\nAlso a neutrosophic N -group can have two types of sub N -groups.\n1. Neutrosophic sub N -groups. 2.

The semigroup generated by S and I i.e. S I is denoted by S I is defined to be a neutrosophic\nsemigroup where I is indeterminacy element and termed as neutrosophic element. It is interesting to note that all neutrosophic semigroups contain a proper subset which is a semigroup.\nExample 1.2.1: Let {Z  the set of positive and negative integers with zero} , Z is only a semigroup under multiplication.
