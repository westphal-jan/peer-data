Introduction", "text": "Ad hoc microphone arrays consist of a set of sensor nodes spatially distributed over the acoustic field, in an ad hoc fashion. Processing of the data acquired with distributed sensors involves challenges attributed to the issues such as asynchronous sampling and unknown microphone positions. In this paper, we assume that the recordings are synchronized and address the problem of finding the microphone positions; this problem is referred to as microphone calibration. The precise knowledge of the microphones positions is required for a plethora of multi-channel audio processing applications such as distant speech recognition [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and source localization and separation [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].\nPrevious studies often consider activation of a (known) source signal in a specific configuration to estimate the distances between the source and microphones. The pairwise distances are then used to reconstruct the array geometry. This approach is referred to as self-calibration.\nIt may be noted that the knowledge of the source signal simplifies the estimation problems. If the signal is known beforehand, the time of arrival (ToA) of the source signal for each individual microphone is obtained through cross-correlation with the given signal. Hence, the negative effects of noise and reverberation are reduced as only one of the signals is noisy. On the other hand, if the source signal is unknown, the time difference of arrival (TDoA) for a pair of microphones is estimated through cross-correlation of the two microphone signals. Although TDoA-based methods can alleviate the need for activating a specific source signal or prior knowledge on the original signal, they may be more sensitive to noise and reverberation.\nSachar et al. [11] presented a set-up using a pulsed acoustic excitation generated by five domed tweeters for measuring the transmit times and distances between speakers and microphones. Raykar et al. [12] exploited a maximum length sequence or chirp signal in a distributed computing platform. The time difference of arrival of microphone signals were computed by cross-correlation and used for estimating the microphone locations. Since the original signal is known, these techniques are robust to noise and reverberation.\nGaubitch et al. [13] proposed an auto-localization method exploiting the asynchronous timeof-arrival measurements obtained from spatially distributed acoustic events. He developed an\niterative rank reduction algorithm to correct for the time offsets without imposing any geometrical constraint on the placement of the microphones and sound sources. These aligned time-of-arrival measurements are then used to estimate the location of source and microphones using the bilinear optimization approach proposed in [14]. This approach requires a minimum of five microphones and thirteen sound source events.\nIn an alternative approach to alleviate the requirement for a specific source signal, Chen et al. [15] formulated an energy-based method for maximum likelihood estimation of joint sourcesensor positions. These methods require several active sources and the pairwise distances are used for a nonlinear optimization to extract the array geometry.\nPollefeys and Nistre proposed a method for direct joint source and microphone localization which requires matrix factorization and solving linear equations [16]. Along that line, Kuang et al. [17] exploited the rank constraints to determine the unknown time offset for time-of-arrival measurements. The problem is then reduced to solving a system of polynomials for extracting the location of source and microphones. The estimates are further refined using a non-linear least squares optimization to find the correct position and time delays matching the measurements of source-microphones distances. It has been shown that exploiting the structure underlying the problem through rank and polynomial constraints enables direct recovery of source and microphone positions using as few as three microphones and six sources, thus achieves a minimal case for the self-calibration problem.\nRecently, McCowan and Lincoln [18] exploited properties of a diffuse noise field model for microphone calibration; this approach alleviates the need for activating several sources. A diffuse noise field is characterized by noise signals that propagate with equal probability in all directions and its coherence is defined by the sinc function of the distance of the two microphones. The distances can thus be estimated by fitting the computed noise coherence with the sinc function in the least squares sense. Once the pairwise distances are estimated, the classic multi-dimensional scaling method is used to reconstruct the microphone array geometry [19]. Along similar lines, Hennecke et al. [20] proposed a hierarchical approach where the compact sub-arrays are calibrated using the coherence model of a diffuse sound field. A sound signal is activated and the\nrelative positions of the distributed arrays are determined using steered response power based source localization.\nIn this paper, we use the coherence model of a diffuse field for pairwise distance estimation due to its practical assumptions for distant audio applications in reverberant enclosures [7] and no requirement for activating a specific source signal 1. Estimation of the pairwise distances becomes unreliable as the distances between the microphones are increased. Hence, the goal of this paper is to enable microphone calibration when some of the pairwise distances are missing.\nThe problem of missing data arises when the pairwise distance of only a subset of the sensors can be measured. If a source event is activated, device malfunctioning or architectural barriers (e.g. indoor calibration) may cause the signal of the emitted sounds to reach, or be acquired, by only a subset of the sensors. Furthermore, some of sensors deployed far apart may fail to capture the source energy leading to a locality constraint in distance estimation in ad hoc microphone arrays [21]. In this paper, as an example use case, the local pairwise distances are measured based on the diffuse sound field coherence model. However, the proposed algorithm and theoretical results are applicable for calibration of a general ad hoc microphone array network. The approach proposed in this paper imposes no constraint on the geometrical set up.\nTo address the problem of missing distances, we rely on the characteristics of a Euclidean distance matrix. The matrix consisting of the squared pairwise distances has very low rank (explained in Section 3.1). The low-rank property has been investigated in the past years to devise efficient optimization schemes for matrix completion, i.e. recovering a low-rank matrix from randomly known entries. Cande\u0300s et al. [22] showed that a small random fraction of the entries are sufficient to reconstruct a low-rank matrix exactly. Keshavan et al. proposed a matrix completion algorithm known as OptSpace and showed its optimality [23]. Furthermore, they proved that their algorithm is robust against noise [24]. Drineas et al. [25] exploited the low rank property to recover the distance matrix. However, they assume a nonzero probability of obtaining accurate distances for any pair of sensors regardless of their distance. This assumption severely restricts the applicability of their result for the microphone array calibration problem.\n1In fact, the ambient noise typical of many enclosures provides a sound field which enables microphone calibration and no additional source signal is required to be played.\nIn the present study, we first estimate the pairwise distances of the microphones in close proximity using the coherence model of the signals of the two microphones in a diffuse noise field using the improved method described in [26]; this approach implies a local connectivity constraint as the pairwise distances of the further microphones can not be estimated. We construct a matrix of all the pairwise distances with missing entries corresponding to the unknown distances. We exploit the low-rank property of the square of this matrix to enable estimation of all the pairwise distances using matrix completion approach.\nThe goal of this paper is to show that exploiting the combination of the rank condition of Euclidean distance matrices (EDMs), similarity in the measured distances, and projection on the EDM cone enables us to estimate the microphone array geometry accurately from only partial measurements of the pairwise distances. To this end, we show that matrix completion is capable of finding the missing entries in our scenario and provide theoretical guarantees to bound the error for ad hoc microphone calibration considering the local connectivity of the noisy known entries. To increase the accuracy, we incorporate the properties of EDMs in the matrix completion algorithm. We show that imposing EDM characteristics on matrix completion improves the robustness and accuracy of extraction of the ad hoc microphone geometry.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we explain how pairwise distances of the microphones are estimated using the coherence model of the diffuse noise field as an example use case of the proposed method. Section 3 describes the mathematical basis and the model used for the calibration problem. The proposed Euclidean distance matrix completion algorithm is elaborated in Section 4. Section 5 is dedicated to the theoretical guarantees for ad hoc microphone array calibration based on matrix completion. The related methods are investigated in Section 6 and the experimental analysis are presented in section 7. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 8."}, {"heading": "2. Example Use Case", "text": "We consider N microphones located at random positions on a large circular table in a meeting room with homogeneous reverberant acoustics. In the time intervals that there is no active\nspeaker, diffuse noise is the dominant signal in the room. The table is located at the center of the room, hence deviation from diffuseness near the walls can be neglected. Based on the theory of the diffuse noise model, the distance of each two close microphones can be estimated by computing the coherence of their signals \u0393, and fitting a sinc function with the relation expressed as\n\u0393i j(\u03c9) = sinc ( \u03c9di j\nc\n) , (1)\nwhere \u03c9 is the frequency, di j is the distance between the two microphones i and j, and c is the speed of sound [27]. Figure 1 represents an example of the coherence and the fitted sinc function.\nIn practice, if the distance between the sensors is large (e.g. greater than 73 cm [26, 28]) we observe deviations from the diffuse characteristics. The maximum distance that can be computed by this method is assumed to be dmax. Therefore, pairwise distances greater than dmax are missing implying a locality structure in the missing entries in the distance matrix consisting of the pairwise distances. In addition, the computation algorithm can lead to deviation from the model resulting in unreliable estimates of the short distances causing random missing entries in the distance matrix; the random missing entries intend to model the distances which can not be measured due to mismatch or violations of the underlying pairwise distance estimation model pertained to the acoustic ambiguities. Furthermore, the known entries are noisy due to measurement inaccuracies and variations of diffuseness [28]."}, {"heading": "3. Problem Formulation", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1. Distance Matrix", "text": "Consider a distance matrix DN\u00d7N consisting of the distances between N microphones con-\nstructed as\nD = [ di j ] , di j = \u2225\u2225\u2225xi \u2212 x j\u2225\u2225\u2225 , i, j \u2208 {1, . . . ,N} , (2) where di j is the Euclidean distance between microphones i and j located at xi and x j. Therefore, D is a symmetric matrix and it is often full rank.\nLet XN\u00d7\u03b6 denote the position matrix whose ith row, xTi \u2208 R\u03b6 , is the position of microphone i in \u03b6-dimensional Euclidean coordinate where microphones are deployed and .T denotes the transpose operator.

Therefore, the\nrank of the squared distance matrix constructed of the elements Mi j = [ d2i j ] is at most \u03b6 + 2 [25]. For instance, if the microphones are located on a plane or shell of a sphere, M has rank 4 and if they are placed on a line or circle, the rank is exactly 3. Hence, there is significant dependency between the elements of M and exploiting this low-rank property is the core of the proposed algorithm in this paper."}, {"heading": "3.2.

Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion Algorithm", "text": "The approach proposed in this paper exploits low-rank matrix completion and incorporates\nthe EDM properties for recovering the distance matrix."}, {"heading": "4.1. Matrix Completion", "text": "We recall our problem of having N microphones distributed on a space of dimension \u03b6. Hence, the squared distance matrix M has rank \u03b7 = \u03b6 + 2, but it is only partially known. The objective is to recover MN\u00d7N of rank \u03b7 N from a sampling of its entries without having to ascertain all the N2 entries, or collect N2 measurements about M. The approach proposed through matrix completion relies on the fact that a low-rank data matrix carries much less information than its ambient dimension implies. Intuitively, as the matrix M has (2N \u2212 \u03b7)\u03b7 degrees of freedom3, we need to know at least \u03b7N of the row entries as well as \u03b7N of the column entries reduced by \u03b72 of the repeated values to recover the entire elements of M.\nGiven ME defined in (12), the matrix completion recovers an estimate of the distance matrix\nM\u0302 through the following optimization\nMinimize rank (M\u0302 ) subject to M\u0302i j = Mi j , (i, j) \u2208 E (16)\nIn this paper, we use the procedure of OptSpace proposed by Keshavan et al. [24] for estimating a matrix given the desired rank \u03b7. This algorithm is implemented in three steps: (1)\n3The degrees of freedom can be estimated by counting the parameters in the singular value decomposition (the number of degrees of freedom associated with the description of the singular values and of the left and right singular vectors). When the rank is small, this is considerably smaller than N2 [30].\nTrimming, (2) Projection and (3) Minimizing the cost function.\nIn the trimming step, a row or a column is considered to be over-represented if it contains more samples than twice the average number of non-zero samples per row or column. These rows or columns can dominate the spectral characteristics of the observed matrix ME . Thus, some of their entries are removed uniformly at random from the observed matrix. Let M\u0303E be the resulting matrix of this trimming step.\nIn the projection step, we first compute the singular value decomposition (SVD) of M\u0303E thus\nM\u0303E = N\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c3i(M\u0303E)U.iVT.i , (17)\nwhere \u03c3i(\u00b7) denotes the ith singular value of the matrix and U.i and V.i designate the ith column of the corresponding SVD matrices. Then, the rank-\u03b7 projection, P\u03b7(\u00b7) returns the matrix obtained by setting to 0 all but the \u03b7 largest singular values as\nP\u03b7(M\u0303E) = (N2/|E|) \u03b7\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c3i(M\u0303E)U.iVT.i = U0S0V T 0 . (18)\nStarting from the initial guess provided by the rank-\u03b7 projection P\u03b7(M\u0303E), U = U0 , V = V0 and S = S0, the final step solves a minimization problem stated as follows: Given U \u2208 RN\u00d7\u03b7,V \u2208 RN\u00d7\u03b7, find\nF(U,V) = min S\u2208R\u03b7\u00d7\u03b7 F (U,V,S) ,\nF (U,V,S) = 1 2 \u2211 (i, j)\u2208E (Mi j \u2212 (USVT )i, j)2 (19)\nF(U,V) is determined by minimizing the quadratic functionF over S, U, V estimated by gradient decent with line search in each iteration.

Cadzow Projection to the Set of EDM Properties", "text": "The classic matrix completion algorithm as described above recovers a low-rank matrix with elements as close as possible to the known entries. However, the recovered matrix does not necessarily correspond to a Euclidean distance matrix; for example, EDMs are symmetric with zero diagonal elements. These properties are not incorporated in the matrix completion algorithm. Hence, we modify the aforementioned procedure to have, as output, matrices that are closer to EDMs [26].\nTo this end, we apply a Cadzow-like method. The Cadzow algorithm [31] (also known as Papoulis-Gershberg) is a method for finding a signal which satisfies a composite of properties by iteratively projecting the signal into the property sets. We modify the matrix completion algorithm by inserting an extra step at each iteration. In the classic version of this algorithm a simple rank-\u03b7 approximation is used as the starting point for the iterations using gradient descent on (19). After each iteration of the gradient descent, we apply the transformation Pc : RN\u00d7N 7\u2212\u2192 SNh on the obtained matrix where S N h is the space of symmetric, positive hollow matrices, to make sure that the output satisfies the following properties\nM\u0302 \u2208 SNh \u21d0\u21d2  di j = 0\u21d4 xi = x j di j > 0, i , j di j = d ji\n(20)\nfor i, j \u2208 [N]; nonnegativity and symmetry are achieved by setting all the negative elements to zero and averaging the symmetric elements."}, {"heading": "4.3.

In the second step, conditions (30) and (31) are shown to hold along with the (\u00b51, \u00b52)-incoherence property.\nTheorem 2.

(34)\nTherefore, based on Theorem 2, Theorem 3 and the relations (29) and (34), the upper bound stated in (28) is correct where C1 = C\u20321C \u2032\u2032 1 and C2 = C \u2032 2C \u2032\u2032 2 ; it is enough to investigate conditions (30) and (31) and (\u00b51, \u00b52)-incoherency of M to prove Theorem 1.\nTo show the inequality stated in (30), we can equivalently show that\nN p \u2265 C\u20321\u00b52\u03b72\u03ba6\u03b7(M) log N , (35)\nwhere \u00b5 = max(\u00b51, \u00b52). In order to show that (35) holds with high probability for N \u2265 C log N/p and some constant C, we show that \u03ba\u03b7(M) and \u00b5 are bounded with high probability independent of N.\nThe squared distance between xi and x j \u2208 R\u03b6 is given by\nMi j = \u03c12i + \u03c1 2 j \u2212 2xTi x j , (36)\nwhere \u03c1i is the distance of microphone i from the center of the table. The squared distance matrix can be expressed as\nM = ASAT , (37)\nwhere for a planar deployment of microphones, i.e., \u03b6 = 2, \u03b7 = 4, and xTi = [xi, yi] \u2208 R2, we have\nA =  a/2 x1 y1 \u2212a2/4 + \u03c121 ... ... ... ...\na/2 xN yN \u2212a2/4 + \u03c12N  , (38) and\nS =  2 0 0 2/a 0 \u22122 0 0 0 0 \u22122 0\n2/a 0 0 0\n . (39)\nSince S is nondefective, using eigendecomposition, there is a non-singular matrixW and diagonal matrix \u0393 such that\nS =W\u0393W\u22121 , (40)\nwhere\n\u0393 = diag \u22122,\u22122, a + \u221a4 + a2a , a \u2212 \u221a 4 + a2 a  . (41)\nThe largest and smallest singular values of S are \u03c31(S) = a+ \u221a 4+a2 a and \u03c34(S) = min ( 2, \u221a 4+a2\u2212a a ) respectively. Based on (37), we have\n\u03c31(M) \u2264 \u03c31(S)\u03c31(AAT ) , (42)\n\u03c34(M) \u2265 \u03c34(S)\u03c34(AAT ) . (43)\nTherefore, to bound \u03ba4(M) = \u03c31(M)/\u03c34(M), we need to derive the bound for \u03c31(AAT ) and \u03c34(AAT ). Assuming a uniform distribution of the microphones on the circular table, we have the following distribution for \u03c1\nP\u03c1(\u03c1) = 2\u03c1 a2\nfor 0 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 a . (44)\nTherefore, the expectation of the matrix AT A is\nE[AT A] =  Na2/4 0 0 Na3/8 0 Na4/4 0 0 0 0 Na4/4 0\nNa3/8 0 0 7Na4/48\n . (45)\nHence, the largest and smallest singular values of E[AT A] are N\u03c3max(a) and N\u03c3min(a) respectively with \u03c3max(a) and \u03c3min(a) independent of N. Moreover, \u03c3i(\u00b7) is a Lipschitz continuous function of its arguments and based on the Chernoff bound [34], we get\nP(\u03c31(AAT ) > 2N\u03c3max(a)) \u2264 e\u2212C \u2032N , (46) P(\u03c31(AAT ) < (1/2)N\u03c3max(a)) \u2264 e\u2212C \u2032N , (47)\nP(\u03c34(AAT ) < (1/2)N\u03c3min(a)) \u2264 e\u2212C \u2032N , (48)\nfor a constant C\u2032. Hence, with high probability, based on relations (42), (43), (46) and (48), we have\n\u03ba4(M) \u2264 4\u03c3max(a)\u03c31(S) \u03c3min(a)\u03c34(S) = f\u03ba4 (a) . (49)\nThis bound is independent of N.\nIn the next step, we have to bound \u00b51 and \u00b52. The rank of matrix A is \u03b7, therefore there are matrices B \u2208 R\u03b7\u00d7\u03b7 and V \u2208 RN\u00d7\u03b7 such that A = VBT and VT V = NI. Given M = U\u03a3UT and (37), we have \u03a3 = QT BTSBQ and U = VQ for an orthogonal matrix Q. To show the incoherence propertyA1, we show that\n\u2016Vi.\u20162 \u2264 \u03b7 \u00b51 \u2200 i \u2208 [N] , (50)\nwhere Vi. denotes the transpose of ith row of the corresponding matrix. For \u03b7 = 4, since Vi. = B\u22121 Ai., we have \u2016Vi.\u20162 \u2264 \u03c34(B)\u22122\u2016Ai.\u20162 and \u03c34(A) = \u221a N \u03c34(B), therefore\n\u2016Vi.\u20162 \u2264 \u03c34(A)\u22122\u2016Ai.\u20162 N . (51)\nMoreover, \u2016Ai.\u20162 = a2/4 + \u03c12i + (\u2212a2/4 + \u03c12i )2 \u2264 5a2/4 + 9a4/16. Defining\nf\u00b51 (a) = 5a2/2 + 9a4/8\n\u03c3min(a) , (52)\nand based on (48) and (51), with high probability we have\n\u2016Ui.\u20162 \u2264 f\u00b51 (a) \u2200 i \u2208 [N] . (53)\nTherefore, the incoherence propertyA1 for \u00b51 = f\u00b51 (a)/\u03b7 is correct; that is independent of N. To prove the incoherence property A2, it is enough to prove that \u2223\u2223\u2223Mi j/\u03c31(M)\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u221a\u03b7 \u00b52/N for all i, j \u2208 [N]. The maximum value of Mi j is 4a2 and based on (43) and (48) we have\n\u03c31(M) \u2265 \u03c34(M) \u2265 1 2 N \u03c3min(a)\u03c34(S) , (54)\nDefining f\u00b52 (a) = 8a 2/\u03c3min(a)\u03c34(S), we have \u2223\u2223\u2223Mi j/\u03c31(M)\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 f\u00b52 (a)N \u2200 i, j \u2208 [N] . (55) Therefore, the incoherence property A2 for \u00b52 = f\u00b52 (a)/ \u221a \u03b7 is correct; that is independent of N. Since \u03ba4(M), \u00b51 and \u00b52 are bounded independent of N, matrix M is (\u00b51, \u00b52)-incoherent and the inequalities (30) and (35) are correct.\nFurther, (31) holds with high probability, if the right-hand side of (28) is less than C3 \u03c3min(a)\u03c34(S), since based on (48), \u03c3\u03b7(M)N \u2265 1 2\u03c3min(a)\u03c34(S). This finishes the proof of Theorem 1.\nThe theoretical analysis elaborated in this section, elucidates a link between the performance of microphone array calibration and the number of microphones, noise level and the ratio of missing pairwise distances. In Section 7, thorough evaluations are conducted that demonstrate these theoretical insights. Furthermore, The theoretical error bounds of ad hoc microphone calibration established above corresponds to the classic matrix completion algorithm. We will extend the mathematical results to the completion of Euclidean distance matrices incorporating the Cadzow and EDM projections through the experiments. As we will see in Section 7, this bound is not tight for the Cadzow projection and the Euclidean distance matrix completion algorithm as we achieve better results than matrix completion for microphone array calibration."}, {"heading": "6.

In the ideal case where matrix M is complete and noiseless, this algorithm outputs the relative positions of the microphones. At the first step, a double centering transformation is applied to M to subtract the row and column means of the distance matrix via \u039e(M) = \u221212 J M J where J = IN \u2212 1/N1N1TN . The \u03b6 largest eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of \u039e(M) denoted by\u03a0+ and U+ are calculated and the microphone positions are obtained as X = U+ \u221a \u03a0+.\nIn a real scenario of missing distances, a modification called MDS-MAP [35] computes the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in the region of consideration. The shortest path between microphones i and j is defined as the path between two nodes such that the sum of the estimated distance measures of its constituent edges is minimized.

Experimental Analysis", "text": ""}, {"heading": "7.1. A-priori Expectations", "text": "The simplest method that we discussed is the classical MDS algorithm. This method assumes that all the pairwise distances are known and in the case of missing entries and noise, it does not minimize a meaningful utility function. An extension of this method is MDS-MAP which replaces the missing distances with the shortest path. In many scenarios, this is considered as a coarse approximation of the true distances.\nThe SDP-based method on the other hand is known to perform fairly well with missing distance information. Together with its final gradient descent phase, has been shown to find good estimates of the location. However, since each distance information translates into a constraint in the semi-definite program, this approach is not scalable and becomes intractable for large sensor networks.\nThe alternative approach is to minimize the non-convex s-stress function. Although it is known to perform well in many conditions, in the case of missing distances, one cannot eliminate the possibility of falling into local minima using this approach.\nThe approach that we proposed in this paper exploits a matrix completion algorithm to recover the missing distances considering the low-rank as well as Euclidean properties of the distance matrix. The classic matrix completion does not take into account the EDM properties. By integrating the Cadzow projection, the estimated matrix has partial EDM properties, and hence we expect better reconstruction results.

We do not assume a particular (e.g. diffuse noise) model for pairwise distance estimation and the conclusions of this section hold for a general ad hoc array calibration framework where the pairwise distances may be provided by any other means meeting the local connectivity assumption."}, {"heading": "7.2.1. Performance for Different Numbers of Microphones", "text": "In this section, we present the performance of ad hoc array calibration when the number of microphones varies from 15 to 200.

Hence, the total missing entries vary from\n42% to 60%. The standard deviation of the noise on measured distances (expressed through (13)- (14)) between two microphones i and j is \u03c2 di j where \u03c2 = 0.0167; the dependency of the noise level on the distance is due to the limitation of the diffuse noise coherence model for pairwise distance estimation as elaborated in [28].\nThe results for each number of microphones are averaged over 500 random configurations. The calibration error is quantified using the metric defined in (15). Furthermore, the absolute position of the microphones is estimated using the nonlinear optimization method [39] and the mean position error as defined in (59) over all configurations is evaluated.

This observation is inline with the theoretical analysis provided in Section 5. The best results are achieved by the proposed E-MC2 algorithm as it confines the search space to the Euclidean space through iterative EDM projections. We can see that for the number of microphones above 45, the error in position estimation is less than 6.2 cm and it reduces to 2.2 cm for 200 microphones.

Hence, without loss of generality, we rely on this available setup to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.\nThe floor of the room is covered with carpet and surrounded with plaster walls having two big windows. The enclosure is a 8 \u00d7 5.5 \u00d7 3.5 m3 rectangular room and it is moderately reverberant; the reverberation time is about 300 ms. It contains a centrally located 4.8 \u00d7 1.2 m2 rectangular table. This scenario mimics the MONC database [40]. The sampling rate is 48 kHz while the processing applied for microphone calibration is based on down-sampled signal of rate 16 kHz to reduce the computational cost of pairwise distance estimation."}, {"heading": "7.3.2. Pairwise Distance Estimation", "text": "In order to estimate the pairwise distances, we take two microphone signals of length 2.14 s, frame them into short windows of length 1024 samples using a Tukey function (parameter = 0.25) and apply Fourier transform. For each frame, we compute the coherence function. The average of the coherence functions over 1000 frames are computed and used for estimation of the pairwise distance by fitting a sinc function as stated in (1) using the algorithm described in [26]. This algorithm is an improved version of the distance estimation using diffuse noise coherence model which enables a reasonable estimate up to 73 cm. We empirically confirm that the distances beyond that are not reliably estimated so they are regarded as missing. Thereby, the following entries of the Euclidean distance matrix are missing: d10,11, d1,10, d7,10, d8,10, d5,11, d6,11, d7,11 (see Figure 9)."}, {"heading": "7.3.3. Geometry Estimation", "text": "In the scenario described above, microphone calibration is achieved in two steps. First, all methods are used to find the nine close microphones in order to evaluate them for geometry estimation when we have all distances. The geometry of these microphones is fixed and used to calibrate the rest of the network. Figure 11 demonstrates the results of MDS-MAP, SDP, sstress and the proposed Euclidean distance matrix completion algorithm. The calibration error is quantified based on (15). The best results are achieved by the proposed algorithm with error 5.85 cm2. The second place belongs to s-stress with error 6.14 cm2 followed by MDS-MAP and SDP with errors 8.13 cm2 and 8.63 cm2 respectively.\nFigure 12 provides a comparative illustration of the results of matrix completion (MC), MC+Cadzow (MC2) and the proposed Euclidean distance matrix completion (E-MC2) algorithm. We can see that MC2 yields better result with error 7.68 compared to MDS-MAP, SDP and MC, but worse than s-stress. The proposed E-MC2 algorithm achieves the best performance.\nThe scenario using eleven channels of microphones addresses the problem of having partial estimates of the distances for calibration of a microphone array. The experiments show that the proposed method offers the best estimation of the geometry as illustrated in Figure 9 and 10 with an error of 49.6 cm2. As we can see, the proposed Euclidean distance matrix completion algorithm achieves less than half the error of the best state-of-the-art alternative.\nThe worst result belongs to MDS-MAP with error 434.4 cm2 because the shortest path is a poor estimation of missing entries. The s-stress and SDP search the Euclidean space corresponding to the feasible positions hence, their performance are more reasonable with errors 141 cm2 and 125 cm2. The advantage of being constrained to a physically possible search space or close to it is considered in extensions of matrix completion in MC+Cadzow (MC2) and the proposed method (E-MC2) and achieves the best performance. These experimental evaluation confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the hypothesis that incorporating the EDM properties in matrix completion algorithm enables calibration of microphone arrays from partial measurements of the pairwise distances.\nThe theoretical analysis provided in Section 5 elucidates a link between the calibration er-\nror and the number of microphones. To demonstrate this relation, a calibration of a 8-channel circular array when the distances are all measured is performed. In addition, an extra microphone (#12) is also included which is located with a symmetry to microphone 10. Hence, d12,11, d10,12, d3,12, d4,12, d5,12 are also missing. The calibration errors are listed in Table 3.\nFurthermore, in addition to the calibration error expressed in (15), we apply the nonlinear optimization proposed in [39] to find the best match between X\u0302 and X by considering various rigid transformations and quantify the position error as\n1 N N\u2211 n=1 \u2016x\u0302n \u2212 xn\u20162 . (59)\nThe position errors are listed in Table 4. The results show that considering further microphone improves the calibration performance which is in line with the theoretical analysis of Section 5."}, {"heading": "8. Conclusions", "text": "We proposed a Euclidean distance matrix completion algorithm for calibration of ad hoc microphone arrays from partially known pairwise distances. This approach exploits the low-rank property of the distance matrix and recovers the missing entries based on a matrix completion optimization scheme. To incorporate the properties of a Euclidean distance matrix, the estimated matrix at each iteration of the matrix completion is projected onto the EDM cone. Furthermore, we derived the theoretical bounds on the calibration error using matrix completion algorithm. The experimental evaluations conducted on real data recordings demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for ad hoc array calibration. This study confirmed that exploiting the combination of the rank condition of EDMs, similarity in the measured distances, and iterative projection on the EDM cone leads to the best position reconstruction results. The proposed algorithm and the theoretical guarantees are applicable to the general framework of ad hoc sensor networks calibration.\nAppendix 1. Proof of Theorem 2\nThe goal is to find the bound of the norm of the squared distance matrix with missing entries\naccording to structures indicated by E and S . Based on (6) and (11), we define matrix E as\nEi j =  1 if (i, j) \u2208 E \u2229 S 0 otherwise (60)\nBoth E and S are symmetric matrices, hence E is also symmetric. Due to the physical setup, we know that \u03a8E(M)i j \u2264 4a2 for all i, j \u2208 [N] and from the norm definition we have\n\u2016\u03a8E(Ms)\u20162 \u2264 4a2 max \u2016h\u2016=\u2016~\u2016=1 \u2211 i, j |hi| |~ j| Ei j = 4a2\u2016E\u20162 ,\nwhere h = [h1, h2, ..., hN]T and ~ = [~1, ~2, ..., ~N]T are right and left eigenvectors of matrix E. In order to bound \u2016E\u20162, we first define a binomial random variable vector \u03bd = [\u03bd1, \u03bd2, ..., \u03bdN]T where\n\u03bdi = \u2211 j\u2208[N] |Ei j| . (61)\nBased on the Gershgorin circle theorem we have \u2016E\u20162 \u2264 \u2016\u03bd\u2016\u221e. Each entry in matrix E is one with probability p q where q is the probability that the entry is included in structured missing entries or\nq = P{|xi \u2212 x j| \u2265 dmax} . (62)\nHence, we have\nE[\u03bdi] = N pq , (63)\nFor bounding E[\u03bdi], it is necessary to bound q. Figure 13.I depicts the lowest probability of missing distances if the microphone location with respect to the edge of the circular table has a distance more than dmax and Figure 13.II depicts the highest probability if the microphone is located right at the edge of the table.\nThe maximum of dmax is a. We denote the upper bound and lower bound with qmax(a, dmax)\nand qmin(a, dmax) respectively, therefore\nqmin(a, dmax) \u2264 q \u2264 qmax(a, dmax) . (64)\nAs illustrated in Figure 13. qmin(a, dmax) = max{1 \u2212 ( dmax a )2 , 0} and qmax(a, dmax) = 1 \u2212 B\u03c0a2 where B is the intersection area between the two circles. By computing B, we obtain\nqmax = 1 \u2212 2\u03b3 \u03c0 + 1 2\u03c0 sin 4\u03b3 +\n2\u03be2\n\u03c0 [2\u03b3 + sin 2\u03b3] \u2212 2\u03be2 , (65)\nwhere \u03be = dmax/2a and \u03b3 = sin\u22121 \u03be. Based on (63) and (64) we have\nN pqmin(a, dmax) \u2264 E[\u03bdi] \u2264 N pqmax(a, dmax) . (66)\nBy applying the Chernoff bound to \u03bdi we have\nP ( \u03bdi > (1 + )E[\u03bdi] ) \u2264 2\u2212(1+ )E[\u03bdi] , (67) where is an arbitrary positive constant. Therefore, based on (66) we have\nP ( \u03bdi > (1 + )N p qmax ) \u2264 2\u2212(1+ )N p qmin . (68) By applying the union bound we have\nP (\nmax i\u2208[N]\n\u03bdi > (1 + )N p qmax ) \u2264 2\u2212(1+ )N p qmin+log2 N . (69)\nWe assume that qmin and qmax grow as O( log2 NN ); this assumption indicates that the ratio of the structured missing entries with respect to N decreases as N grows5 or in other words, dmax in-\n5This assumption can be dropped to achieve a tighter bound, but it increases the complexity of the proof.\ncreases as the size of the network N grows. Therefore, we have\nP (\nmax i\u2208[N]\n\u03bdi > (1 + )N p qmax ) \u2264 N\u2212\u03b8 , (70)\nwhere the positive parameter \u03b8 = (1 + )p \u2212 1; by choosing \u2265 4/p \u2212 1, with probability greater than 1 \u2212 N\u22123, we have\n\u2016\u03a8E(Ms)\u20162 \u2264 4a2 max i\u2208[N] \u03bdi , (71)\nand based on (70)\n\u2016\u03a8E(Ms)\u20162 \u2264 4a2(1 + \u03b8)qmaxN . (72)\nTherefore, we achieve\n\u2016\u03a8E(Ms)\u20162 \u2264 C\u2032\u20321 a2 log2 N . (73)\nAppendix 2.

(75)\nBy setting t = 2d2max \u221a 6\u03c22 log N we have\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u03a8E(Z s\u0304)\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2264 E (\u2225\u2225\u2225\u03a8E(Z s\u0304)\u2225\u2225\u2225) + 2d2max \u221a6\u03c22 log N (76) with probability bigger than 1\u2212N\u22123.
