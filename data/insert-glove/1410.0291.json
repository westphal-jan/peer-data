However, the Japanese language do have an extensive honorific system, and nouns often take politeness prefixes and suffixes (for animate objects), a small group of suffixes are also used to refer to collective nouns.\nHonorific prefixes The prefixes o- (\u304a-) and go- (\u3054-) are prefixes applied to nouns (and sometimes verbs) to convey a respectful or polite tone of speech. Native Japanese words are preceded by o- while Sino-Japanese words are usually preceded by go-, although there are exceptions to both cases.\n4http://mecab.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mecab/doc/posid.html\n2 of 11\nHonorific suffixes Honorific suffixes are almost always attached to person names and occasionally other non-human objects (such as animals, inanimate objects, etc). These suffixes depend on the formality of the dialogue, the speaker\u2019s familiarity and status difference with the referred person, as well as the gender/age of the referred person.\nCollective suffixes Collective suffixes are appended to nouns to signify a collective group of the noun. These suffixes are often used with singular pronouns to refer to its plural counterpart. Common collective suffixes are -tachi and -ra. Occasionally, these suffixes maybe used with proper animate nouns to signify a group including the mentioned noun (collective, not pluralizing). For instance, Tanaka-tachi maybe translated as \u2018Tanaka and his friends\u2019 or \u2018Tanaka and his family\u2019 but not \u2018some people named Tanaka\u2019. We take this distinction into account when collective suffixes are used in the context of pronouns.\nPronouns Japanese is a pro-drop language, and hence are used less frequently than in English. Hence, pronouns are usually treated morphologically like nouns and plural pronouns are formed with collective suffixes. In addition, pronouns are considered an open lexical class (since it behaves just like a noun), which means that new pronouns are being \u201ccreated\u201d to be used in specialized contexts (age, familiarity, different levels of formality, etc). As such, we will only consider pronouns that are found in our corpus."}, {"heading": "4.2 Verbs", "text": "Verbs in the Japanese language are conjugated extensively depending on their grammatical categories. Due to the agglutinative nature of the language, the suffixes are fairly productive and in casual speech, many contractions are used. Generally, verbs can be conjugated for aspect, polarity, politeness, mood, voice, tense. Details about verb conjugations will be described in \u00a77.1.\n3 of 11"}, {"heading": "4.3 Adjectives", "text": "Japanese do not have adjectives in a syntactic sense. Unlike western languages where adjectives are usually inflected similar to noun declensions, Japanese adjectives are conjugated like a verb. This is because words that behave semantically as adjectives are technically considered as specialized verbs (i -adjectives) or nominals (na-adjectives). There are several other classes of adjectives, which are more commonly used in Classical Japanese, and in Modern Japanese are limited to a select few special cases. There are two main classes of adjectives: adjectival verbs and adjectival nouns."}, {"heading": "5 System Design", "text": ""}, {"heading": "5.1 High level overview", "text": "Our morphological analyzer will focus on the task of analyzing the morphology of individual tokens. Hence, we will design our analyzer to take input from the processed output of MeCab, a high quality state of the art Japanese part of speech tagger and morphological analyzer. MeCab is a CRF classifier that segments and tags each tokens with a part of speech category. It has a hierarchical tag set (of up to 4 levels), starting with 8 coarse categories and 68 fine categories in total. In the case of nouns, it provides a coarse morphological analysis by segmenting the morphemes for honorifics and collectivism and classifying it as suffixes or prefixes belonging to persons, locations, quantifiers, etc. Hence, our contribution would be to incorporate finer details of classification such as politeness and gender attributes. Details of our implementation for nouns would be described in \u00a75.3.\nFor verbs, adjectives and adverbs, the morphemes are not segmented as the surface forms undergo various morphophonological changes. Thus, the analysis by MeCab is limited to the forms of the verbs and its lemma. Our analyzer will therefore focus on extracting the morphological attributes such as tense, mood, voice, etc. The details of our implementation for verbs will be discussed in \u00a77.\nFigure 4 shows the high level view of our morphological analyzer pipeline."}, {"heading": "5.2 Morphological analyzer system details", "text": "We implement our analyzer by building finite state transducers to process and generate finer analyses. We will use Foma5, which is a popular open source tool compiler, programming language, and C library for constructing finite-state automata and transducers for NLP applications.\nOur morphological analyzer will consist of two independent FSTs, for handling (i) nouns, and (ii) verbs/adjectives, which we will describe in the sequel.\n5https://code.google.com/p/foma/\n4 of 11"}, {"heading": "5.3 FSTs for analyzing nouns", "text": "Japanese nouns have fairly regular conjugations, as such, we will design our FST as a transducer that takes MeCab\u2019s part of speech information as input, and translate it into its analysis.\nFrom MeCab\u2019s output, we will have a post-processing script that parses MeCab\u2019s output and convert it into a format suitable for our analyzers. We will do this using a Python script and the input to the FST would be\nN#<token1>/<pos_id1> <token2>/<pos_id2> ...$\nFor some nouns, the prefixes and suffixes have been segmented into separate tokens. Thus, an input may consist of several tokens with different part of speech IDs.\nNoun morphology phenomena The following noun morphology are handled by our analyzer:\n1. Honorific prefixes: \u304a-, \u3054- (common) and\u5fa1- (usually only found in literary writings). Output will be marked with a +polite attribute.\n2. Formal/informal honorific suffixes for animate objects: -\u3061\u3083\u3093, -\u3055\u3093, -\u541b and -\u69d8. For - \u3061\u3083\u3093 and -\u541b, the output will be marked with +informal, while -\u69d8 will be marked with +formal. The very common -\u3055\u3093 suffix is not tagged formal/informal because the use of it is standard in Japanese (as a default polite form) and hence its use do not convey much politeness information beyond that of typical social scenarios. However, all objects with honorific suffixes mentioned above will have an +animate attribute.\n3. Collective suffixes: \u9054, \u7b49, \u65b9, \u305f\u3061, \u3089 and \u304b\u305f. Output will be marked with a +collective attribute.\n4. Table 2 presents a list of pronouns that are handled by our analyzer and their morphological attributes. Furthermore, consecutive sequences of pronouns-collectives are handled as a single entity even if MeCab segments them into separate tokens (i.e +plural instead of +collective).\n5. Noun possessive marker no (\u306e). Noun phrases ending with a no6 token are replaced with a +possessive attribute."}, {"heading": "6 First System Analysis (Nouns)", "text": "We extracted all the types that were tagged as nouns in Tanaka corpus. Table 1 show statistics about nouns in the corpus. We randomly selected 1,000 types to manually evaluate and analyze for mistakes.\nTable 3 shows some statistics about the nouns evaluation set. In general, most nouns in the corpus does not exhibit any morphology. For those that do contain morphological elements, our analyzer was able to identify them with high accuracy. However, our analyzer made a few mistakes (10 on the evaluation set to be exact), which can all be attributed to segmentation/tagging errors returned by MeCab, which was unable to segment the sentences correctly."}, {"heading": "6.1 Examples", "text": "Table 4 shows example analyses produced by our noun FST.\n6MeCab tags such tokens as \u540d\u8a5e,\u975e\u81ea\u7acb,\u4e00\u822c, with a POS ID of 63.\n5 of 11"}, {"heading": "7 FSTs for analyzing verbs and adjectives", "text": "Japanese verbs and adjectives are handled very similarly. In fact, most adjectives can be considered a form of specialized verbs, and feature very similar conjugation rules. As such, we shall use a single FST to handle these two categories of words."}, {"heading": "7.1 Verb morphology phenomena", "text": "Lexically, almost every verb in Japanese is belongs to one of four conjugation groups:\n(i) Ichidan verb (\u4e00\u6bb5\u52d5\u8a5e),\n(ii) Godan verb (\u4e94\u6bb5\u52d5\u8a5e),\n(iii) Sa row irregular conjugations (\u30b5\u884c\u5909\u683c\u6d3b\u7528), and\n(iv) Ka row irregular conjugations (\u30ab\u884c\u5909\u683c\u6d3b\u7528)\nA verb in Japanese is made up two parts, a stem form and a series of morphemes. The stem form is usually written in kanji along with a kana character that denote one of the 6 verb forms in\n6 of 11\nJapanese. The morphemes suffixes are usually written in kana. We refer the user to a comprehensive grammar guidebook for more information about the stem forms. Here, we will briefly describe the morpheme suffixes that are handled by our analyzer. We will now describe the suffixes that are analyzed by our system:\nIn addition, there are also many auxiliaries that compound with non te-form stems.\n6. Conditional moods (+cond) are used in conditionals and denoted (usually) by the -ba (-\u3070) and -ra (-\u3089) suffixes.\n7 of 11\n7. Volitional form (+vol) expresses intention and are used with the -u (-\u3046) suffix.\n8. Imperative form (+imp) are characterized by verbs conjugating to have an e phonetic ending.\n9. Causative forms (+caus) generally have a -seru (-\u305b\u308b) / -saru (-\u3055\u308b) suffix.\n10. Potential forms (+pot) are used to express that one has the ability to do something.\n11. Like nouns, verbs have a polite form (+pol) that is usually characterized by a -masu (-\u307e\u3059) suffix."}, {"heading": "7.2 Phonological rules", "text": "Like most languages, there are several phonological rules that apply to the conjugated verbs and adjectives. One such common and regular rule is phonological change when ending with a [t] consonant. For example te-form verb endings -ite, -chite, -rite change to a double consonant, -tte, endings in -bite, -mite, -nite change to -nde (voicing of the te syllable), endings in -kite change to -ite, and endings in -gite change to -ide (voicing of the te syllable). The above double consonants and voicing patterns also applies when dealing with perfective aspect endings -ta.\nThere are also numerous contractions that are used in colloquial conversations. For instance, the progressive marker -teiru becomes -teru and -teshimau becomes -chau."}, {"heading": "7.3 FST as a generator", "text": "Due to the agglutinative nature of the language, the morphemes suffixes can be added in many different arbitrary order. Hence, we have designed the FST as a generator, meaning the output of the FST is the surface form of a conjugated verb and the input is its lemma and morphological feature. The FST inherently has no knowledge of valid or invalid orderings of these suffixes and thus tend to over generate surface forms for a particular input.\nWhen the FST is being used, it is trivial to reverse the direction of the FST, and return the underlying form of the verb token. However, it is very possible for a verb token to have multiple analysis and it is up to the downstream application to decide between possible analyses.\n7.4 Adjective morphology phenomena\n. As described in \u00a74.3, there are two main classes of adjectives, and we describe how our analyzer handle them here.\nAdjectival verbs (i-adjectives) end with -i (-\u3044) and can be conjugated with almost all the suffixes for verbs. These adjectives are also often found in predicate positions, denoting their verb-like nature. For instance, when a verb takes on a -nai negation suffix, it can be treated morphologically like an i-adjective, and likewise, when an i -adjective is conjugated for te-form, it behaves just like any other te-form verb.\nAdjectival nouns (na-adjectives) always occur with a form of the copula -da (-\u3060). Because adjectival nouns are usually formed from nouns, it has led many linguists to consider them a type of nominal. The copula (considered an irregular ichidan verb) can conjugated just like any other verb. It is thus treated as such by our analyzers.\n8 of 11\nOther adjective classes have limited use in modern Japanese. In our analyzer, we have chosen to ignore these adjectives and not analyze them."}, {"heading": "8 Second System Analysis (verbs and adjectives)", "text": "We extracted all the tokens that were tagged as verbs or adjectives in the Tanaka corpus. Table 1 show statistics about the verbal and adjectival lexical items in the corpus. From all the tokens, we extracted 2,000 verb and 1,000 adjective tokens for manual evaluation. Since for each token, the FST produce multiple analyses (there can also be multiple valid analyses absent context), we measure the precision/recall performance of our analyzer. Precision is computed by\n1\n|evaluation set|\n\u2211\ni\u2208evaluation set\n# of correct analyses\n# of analyses\nand recall is computed by\n1\n|evaluation set|\n\u2211\ni\u2208evaluation set\nI(# of correct analyses > 0)\nTable 5 presents the results of our evaluation. Since our FST over generates (see table 6 and 7 for such examples), we were able to obtain reasonably good recall. However, we missed many items due to a lack of coverage in our lexicon. The Japanese-Multilingual dictionary, though comprehensive, does not provide coverage of all the lexical items that appeared in the Tanaka corpus. This problem is more pronounced in verbs due to verbs being a much larger and more productive lexical class.\nThe precision for our verb analysis were quite low, which we attribute to the agglutinative nature of the language. The morpheme suffixes are a productive class, and the Tanaka corpus contain a significant amount of conversational text and colloquial language. On the other hand, adjectives tend to exhibit far lesser conjugations and hence we are able to achieve better precision. In fact, 77.4% of the surface forms in the adjective evaluation set were found to be in dictionary form (i.e were not conjugated). Adjectives are usually conjugated when they are used in the predicate position."}, {"heading": "8.1 Examples", "text": "See table 6 and 7 for verb and adjective example analyses respectively."}, {"heading": "9 Final Revisions", "text": "Many of the errorneous analyses produced can be eliminated by means of simple heuristics. We built a post-processing recognizer (instead of an FST) that takes as input: (i) the dictionary forms (lemmas) returned by MeCab, and (ii) each of the various analyses returned by our; and decide whether the analysis\n9 of 11\n(i) contained invalid orderings of morphemes, or\n(ii) matches MeCab\u2019s dictionary forms.\nWe believe this will help reduce the number of analyses generated per input, thus improving precision without hurting recall."}, {"heading": "10 Future Work", "text": "For future work, we propose the following improvements\n(i) increasing coverage of verbal and adjectival lexical items,\n(ii) extending coverage of analyzer to handle te-form conjunctive verbs,\n(iii) extending coverage of adjective analyzer to handle rare adjectives and verb classes, and\n(iv) possibly more heuristics in the post-processing to reduce over-generation.\n10 of 11"}], "references": [{"title": "JMDict: A Japanese-Multilingual Dictionary", "author": ["James Breen"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Workshop on Multilingual Linguistic Resources,", "citeRegEx": "Breen.,? \\Q2004\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Breen.", "year": 2004}, {"title": "FOMA: A Finite-State Compiler and Library.

The Japanese writing system makes extensive use of Chinese characters, also known as kanji , along with scripts, hiragana and katakana, which are syllabic.
