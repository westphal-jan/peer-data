The objective of clustering is to cluster the original data points into various clusters, so that data points within the same cluster are dense while those in different clusters are far away from each other (Filippone et al. 2008). Researchers have proposed a variety of clustering algorithms, such as Kmeans clustering and mixture models (Wang et al. 2014; Nie, Wang, and Huang 2014; Nie et al. 2011b), etc.\nThe existing clustering algorithms, however, mostly work well when the samples\u2019 dimensionality is low. When partitioning high-dimensional data, the performance of these algorithms is not guaranteed. For example, K-means clustering iteratively assigns each data point to the cluster\nThis paper was partially supported by the ARC DECRA project DE130101311, UQ ECR (2013002401) and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Application.

But the distance/similarity measurements may be inaccurate on high-dimensional data, which tends to limit the clustering performance. As suggested by some researchers, many high-dimensional data may exhibit dense grouping in a low-dimensional subspace (Nie et al. 2009). Hence, researchers have proposed to first project the original data into a low-dimensional subspace via some dimensionality reduction techniques and then cluster the computed lowdimensional embedding for high-dimensional data clustering. For instance, a popular approach is to use Principle component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the original data followed by Kmeans for clustering (PcaKm) (Xu and Wunsch 2005). Ding et al. present a clustering algorithm based on Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method (Ding and Li 2007). Ye et al propose discriminative K-means (DisKmeans) clustering which unifies the iterative procedure of dimensionality reduction and K-means clustering into a trace maximization problem (Ye, Zhao, and Wu 2007).\nAnother genre of clustering, i.e., spectral clustering (Shi and Malik 2000) integrates dimensionality reduction into its clustering process. The basic idea of spectral clustering is to find a clustering assignment of the data points by adopting the spectrum of similarity matrix that leverages the nonlinear manifold structure of original data. Spectral clustering has been shown to be easy to implement and oftentimes it outperforms traditional clustering methods because of its capacity of mining intrinsic geometric structures, which facilitates partitioning data with more complicated structures. The benefit of utilizing manifold information has been demonstrated in many applications, such as image segmentation and web mining. Due to the advantage of spectral clustering, different variants of spectral clustering algorithms have been proposed these years (Li et al. 2015). For example, local learning-based clustering (LLC) (Wu and Schlkopf 2006) utilizes a kernel regression model for label prediction based on the assumption that the class label of a data point can be determined by its neighbors. Self-tuning SC (Zelnik-Manor and Perona 2004) is able to tune parameters automatically in an unsupervised scenario. Normalized cuts is capable of balancing the volume of clusters for the usage of data density information\n(Shi and Malik 2000). Spectral clustering is essentially a two-stage approach, i.e., manifold learning based in the original highdimensional space and dimensionality reduction. To achieve proper clustering, spectral clustering assumes that two nearby data points in the high density region of the reduceddimensional space have the same cluster label. However, this assumption does not always hold. More possibly, these nearest neighbors may be far away from each other in the original high-dimensional space due to the curse of dimensionality. That being said, the distance measurement of the original data could not precisely reflect the low-dimensional manifold structure, thus leading to suboptimal clustering performance.\nIntuitively, if the manifold structure in the lowdimensional space is precisely captured, the clustering performance could be enhanced when applied to highdimensional data clustering. Aiming to achieve this goal, we propose a novel clustering algorithm that is able to mine the inherent manifold structure of the low-dimensional space for clustering. Moreover, compared to traditional spectral clustering algorithms, the shrunk pattern learned by the proposed algorithm does not have an orthogonal constraint, giving it more flexibility to fit the manifold structure. It is worthwhile to highlight the following merits of our work:\n\u2022 The proposed algorithm is more capable of uncovering the manifold structure. Particularly, the shrunk pattern does not have the orthogonal constraint, making it more flexible to fit the manifold structure.\n\u2022 The integration of manifold learning and clustering makes the former particularly tailored for the latter. This is intrinsically different from most state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.\n\u2022 The proposed algorithm is convex and converges to global optimum, which indicates that the proposed algorithm does not rely on the initialization.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. After reviewing related work on spectral clustering in section 2, we detail the proposed algorithm in section 3. Extensive experimental results are given in section 4 and section 5 concludes this paper."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "Our work is inspired by spectral clustering. Therefore, we review the related work on spectral clustering in this section."}, {"heading": "Basics of Spectral Clustering", "text": "To facilitate the presentation, we first summarize the notations that will be frequently used in this paper. Given a dataset X = {x1, . . . , xn}, xi \u2208 Rd(1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) is the i-th datum and n is the total number of data points. The objective of clustering is to partition \u03c7 into c clusters. Denote the cluster assignment matrix by Y = {y1, . . . , yn} \u2208 Rn\u00d7c, where yi \u2208 {0, 1}c\u00d71 (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) is the cluster indicator vector for the datum xi. The j-th element of yi is 1 if xi is clustered to the j-th cluster, and 0 otherwise.\nExisting spectral clustering algorithms adopt a weighted graph to partition the data. Let us denote G = {X , A} as a weighted graph with a vertex set X and an affinity matrix A \u2208 Rn\u00d7n. Aij is the affinity of a pair of vertexes of the weighted graph. Aij is commonly defined as:\nAij =\n{ exp(\u2212 \u2016xi\u2212xj\u2016 2\n\u03b42 ), if xi and xj are k nearest neighbors.\n0, otherwise.\nwhere \u03b4 is the parameter to control the spread of neighbors. The Laplacian matrix L is computed according to L = D \u2212 A, where D is a diagonal matrix with the diagonal elements as Dii = \u2211 j Aij , \u2200i. Following the work in (Ye, Zhao, and Wu 2007), we denote the scaled cluster indicator matrix F as follows:\nF = [F1, F2, . . . , Fn] T = Y (Y TY )\u2212 1 2 , (1)\nwhere Fi is the scaled cluster indicator of xi. The j-th column of F is defined as follows by (Ye, Zhao, and Wu 2007):\nfj =  0, . . . , 0,\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n\u2211j\u22121 i=1 ni\n1 \u221a nj , . . . , 1 \u221a nj , \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 nj 0, . . . , 0\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\u2211 c i=j+1 nk\n  , (2)\nwhich indicates which data points are partitioned into the jth cluster Cj . nj is the number of data points in cluster Cj .\nThe objective function of spectral clustering algorithm is generally formulated as follows:\nmin F\nTr(FTLF )\ns.t. F = Y (Y TY )\u2212 1 2\n(3)\nwhere Tr(\u00b7) denotes the trace operator. By denoting I as an identity matrix, we can define the normalized Laplacian matrix Ln as:\nLn = I \u2212D\u2212 1 2AD\u2212 1 2 . (4)\nBy replacing L in Eq. (3) with the normalized Laplacian matrix, the objective function becomes the well-known SC algorithm normalized cut (Shi and Malik 2000). In the same manner, if we replace L in Eq. (3) by the Laplacian matrix obtained by local learning (Yang et al. 2010)(Wu and Schlkopf 2006), the objective function converts to Local Learning Clustering (LLC)."}, {"heading": "Progress on Spectral Clustering", "text": "Being easy to implement and promising for many applications, spectral clustering has been widely studied for different problems. Chen et al. propose a Landmark-based Spectral Clustering (LSC) for large scale clustering problems (Chen and Cai 2011). Specifically, a few representative data points are first selected as the landmarks and the original data points are then represented as the linear combinations of these landmarks. The spectral clustering is performed on the landmark-based representation.\nYang et al. propose to utilize a nonnegative constraint to relax the elements of cluster indicator matrix for spectral clustering (Yang et al. 2011). Liu et al. propose to compress the original graph used for spectral clustering into a sparse bipartite graph. The clustering is then performed on the bipartite graph instead, which improved the efficiency for large-scale data (Liu et al. 2013). Xia et al. propose a multi-view spectral clustering method based on low-rank and sparse decomposition (Xia et al. 2014). Yang et al. propose to use Laplacian Regularized L1-Graph for clustering (Yang et al. 2014). Tian et al. recently propose to adopt deep learning in spectral clustering (Tian et al. 2014).\nIn spite of the encouraging progress, few of the existing spectral clustering methods have considered learn the manifold in the low-dimensional subspace more precisely, not to mention integrating such manifold learning and clustering into a unified framework. This issue shall be addressed in this paper for boosted clustering performance."}, {"heading": "The Proposed Algorithm", "text": "In this section, we present the details of the proposed algorithm. A fast iterative method is also proposed to solve the objective function."}, {"heading": "Problem Formulation", "text": "Our algorithms is built atop the aim of uncovering the utmost manifold structure in the low-dimensional subspace of original data. Inspired by (Hou et al. 2013), we adopt the pattern shrinking during the manifold learning and the shrunk patterns are exploited for clustering simultaneously.\nTo begin with, we have the following notations. Denote the shrunk patterns of n data samples as {g1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , gn}, where gi \u2208 Rc. We first obtain spectral embedding F of the original samples by minimizing the traditional spectral clustering algorithm min Tr(FTLnF ), where Ln is a normalized Laplacian matrix.\nNext, the shrunk patterns are computed by satisfying the following requirements. (1) The shrunk patterns should keep consistency with the spectral embedding. To be more specific, the shrunk patterns should not be far away from the spectral clustering. (2) Note that nearby points are more likely to belong to the same cluster. We thus design a similarity matrix to measure pair similarity of any two spectral embedding, which the shrunk patters should follow.\nTo characterize the manifold structure of the spectral embedding {f1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , fn}, a k-nearest neighbor graph is constructed by connecting each point to its k nearest neighbors. The similarity matrix, W , is computed by Wij = exp(\u2212 \u2016fi\u2212fj\u2016 2\n\u03b42 ).\nFrom this similarity matrix, we can observe that if two spectral embeddings are nearby, they should belong to the same cluster and the corresponding weight should be large, which satisfies the first requirement (Nie et al. 2011a).\nTo keep the local similarity of spectral embedding, we propose to optimize the following objective function.\nmin G\n\u2211\nij\nWij\u2016gi \u2212 gj\u20162 (5)\nWe also aim to keep the consistency between spectral embedding and shrunk patterns. Hence, we propose to minimize the following loss function directly.\nmin G\n\u2016G\u2212 F\u201622 (6)\nTo this end, we formulate the objection function as follows:\nmin G\n\u2016G\u2212 F\u201622 + \u03b3 \u2211\ni,j\nWij\u2016gi \u2212 gj\u20162 (7)\nwhere \u03b3 is a balance parameter. It can be easily proved that our formulation is convex. Due to the space limit, we omit the proof here. Since our method exploits shrunk patterns as the input for clustering, we name it Spectral Shrunk Clustering (SSC).\nAs indicated in (Ma et al. 2012; Kong, Ding, and Huang 2011), the least square loss function is not robust to outliers. To make our method even more effective, we follow (Ma et al. 2012; Nie et al. 2010) and employ l2,1-norm to handle the outliers. The objective function is rewritten as follows:\nmin G\n\u2016G\u2212 F\u20162,1 + \u03b3 \u2211\ni,j\nWij\u2016gi \u2212 gj\u20162 (8)"}, {"heading": "Optimization", "text": "The proposed function involves the l2,1-norm, which is difficult to solve in a closed form.

Most<lb>existing spectral clustering algorithms integrate dimen-<lb>sionality reduction into the clustering process assisted<lb>by manifold learning in the original space. However,<lb>the manifold in reduced-dimensional subspace is likely<lb>to exhibit altered properties in contrast with the orig-<lb>inal space. Thus, applying manifold information ob-<lb>tained from the original space to the clustering process<lb>in a low-dimensional subspace is prone to inferior per-<lb>formance. Aiming to address this issue, we propose a<lb>novel convex algorithm that mines the manifold struc-<lb>ture in the low-dimensional subspace. In addition, our<lb>unified learning process makes the manifold learning<lb>particularly tailored for the clustering. Compared with<lb>other related methods, the proposed algorithm results in<lb>more structured clustering result. To validate the effi-<lb>cacy of the proposed algorithm, we perform extensive<lb>experiments on several benchmark datasets in compar-<lb>ison with some state-of-the-art clustering approaches.<lb>The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed<lb>algorithm has quite promising clustering performance. Introduction<lb>Clustering has been widely used in many<lb>real-world applications (Jain and Dubes 1988;<lb>Wang, Nie, and Huang 2014). The objective of cluster-<lb>ing is to cluster the original data points into various<lb>clusters, so that data points within the same cluster<lb>are dense while those in different clusters are far away<lb>from each other (Filippone et al. 2008). Researchers have<lb>proposed a variety of clustering algorithms, such as K-<lb>means clustering and mixture models (Wang et al. 2014;<lb>Nie, Wang, and Huang 2014; Nie et al. 2011b), etc.<lb>The existing clustering algorithms, however, mostly work<lb>well when the samples\u2019 dimensionality is low. When par-<lb>titioning high-dimensional data, the performance of these<lb>algorithms is not guaranteed. For example, K-means clus-<lb>tering iteratively assigns each data point to the cluster This paper was partially supported by the ARC DECRA project<lb>DE130101311, UQ ECR (2013002401) and Tianjin Key Labo-<lb>ratory of Cognitive Computing and Application.

But<lb>the distance/similarity measurements may be inaccurate<lb>on high-dimensional data, which tends to limit the clus-<lb>tering performance. As suggested by some researchers,<lb>many high-dimensional data may exhibit dense grouping<lb>in a low-dimensional subspace (Nie et al. 2009). Hence, re-<lb>searchers have proposed to first project the original data<lb>into a low-dimensional subspace via some dimensionality<lb>reduction techniques and then cluster the computed low-<lb>dimensional embedding for high-dimensional data cluster-<lb>ing. For instance, a popular approach is to use Princi-<lb>ple component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensional-<lb>ity of the original data followed by Kmeans for cluster-<lb>ing (PcaKm) (Xu and Wunsch 2005). Ding et al. present a<lb>clustering algorithm based on Linear discriminant analysis<lb>(LDA) method (Ding and Li 2007). Ye et al propose dis-<lb>criminative K-means (DisKmeans) clustering which uni-<lb>fies the iterative procedure of dimensionality reduction and<lb>K-means clustering into a trace maximization problem<lb>(Ye, Zhao, and Wu 2007). Another genre of clustering, i.e., spectral clustering<lb>(Shi and Malik 2000) integrates dimensionality reduction<lb>into its clustering process. The basic idea of spectral clus-<lb>tering is to find a clustering assignment of the data points<lb>by adopting the spectrum of similarity matrix that leverages<lb>the nonlinear manifold structure of original data. Spectral<lb>clustering has been shown to be easy to implement and of-<lb>tentimes it outperforms traditional clustering methods be-<lb>cause of its capacity of mining intrinsic geometric struc-<lb>tures, which facilitates partitioning data with more com-<lb>plicated structures. The benefit of utilizing manifold infor-<lb>mation has been demonstrated in many applications, such<lb>as image segmentation and web mining. Due to the ad-<lb>vantage of spectral clustering, different variants of spec-<lb>tral clustering algorithms have been proposed these years<lb>(Li et al. 2015). For example, local learning-based cluster-<lb>ing (LLC) (Wu and Schlkopf 2006) utilizes a kernel regres-<lb>sion model for label prediction based on the assumption<lb>that the class label of a data point can be determined by its<lb>neighbors. Self-tuning SC (Zelnik-Manor and Perona 2004)<lb>is able to tune parameters automatically in an unsupervised<lb>scenario. Normalized cuts is capable of balancing the vol-<lb>ume of clusters for the usage of data density information (Shi and Malik 2000).<lb>Spectral clustering is essentially a two-stage approach,<lb>i.e., manifold learning based in the original high-<lb>dimensional space and dimensionality reduction. To achieve<lb>proper clustering, spectral clustering assumes that two<lb>nearby data points in the high density region of the reduced-<lb>dimensional space have the same cluster label. However, this<lb>assumption does not always hold. More possibly, these near-<lb>est neighbors may be far away from each other in the original<lb>high-dimensional space due to the curse of dimensionality.<lb>That being said, the distance measurement of the original<lb>data could not precisely reflect the low-dimensional mani-<lb>fold structure, thus leading to suboptimal clustering perfor-<lb>mance.<lb>Intuitively, if the manifold structure in the low-<lb>dimensional space is precisely captured, the clustering<lb>performance could be enhanced when applied to high-<lb>dimensional data clustering. Aiming to achieve this goal, we<lb>propose a novel clustering algorithm that is able to mine the<lb>inherent manifold structure of the low-dimensional space for<lb>clustering. Moreover, compared to traditional spectral clus-<lb>tering algorithms, the shrunk pattern learned by the proposed<lb>algorithm does not have an orthogonal constraint, giving it<lb>more flexibility to fit the manifold structure. It is worthwhile<lb>to highlight the following merits of our work: \u2022 The proposed algorithm is more capable of uncovering the<lb>manifold structure. Particularly, the shrunk pattern does<lb>not have the orthogonal constraint, making it more flexi-<lb>ble to fit the manifold structure.<lb>\u2022 The integration of manifold learning and clustering makes<lb>the former particularly tailored for the latter. This is in-<lb>trinsically different from most state-of-the-art clustering<lb>algorithms.<lb>\u2022 The proposed algorithm is convex and converges to global<lb>optimum, which indicates that the proposed algorithm<lb>does not rely on the initialization. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. After re-<lb>viewing related work on spectral clustering in section 2, we<lb>detail the proposed algorithm in section 3. Extensive experi-<lb>mental results are given in section 4 and section 5 concludes<lb>this paper.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
