The RNNs can contain special units, the long short-term memory (LSTM) cells. They are able to learn long term dependencies but they get unstable when the dimension is chosen greater than one. We defined some useful and necessary properties for the one-dimensional LSTM cell and extend them in the multi-dimensional case. Thereby we introduce several new cells with better stability.

Introduction", "text": "Since the last decade, artificial neural networks (NN) became state-of-the-art in many fields of machine learning, for example they can be applied to pattern recognition. Typical NN are feedforward NN (FFNN) or recurrent NN (RNN), whereas the latter contain recurrent connections. When nearby inputs depend on each other, providing these inputs as additional information to the NN can improve its recognition result. FFNNs obtain these dependencies by making this nearby inputs accessible. If RNNs are used, the recurrent connections can be used to learn if the surrounding input is relevant, but these connections result in a vanishing dependency over time. In S. Hochreiter (1997) the authors develop the long short-term memory (LSTM) which is able to have a long term dependency. This LSTM is extended in A. Graves and Schmidhuber (2007) to the multi-dimensional (MD) case and is used in a hierarchical multi-dimensional RNN (MDRNN) which performed best in three competitions at the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR) in 2009 without any feature extraction and knowledge of the recognized language model. In this paper we analyse these MD LSTM regarding the ability to provide long term dependencies in MDRNNs and show that it can easily have an unwanted growing dependency for higher dimensions. We define a more general description of an LSTM\u2014a cell\u2014and change the LSTM architecture which leads to new MD cell types, which also can provide long term dependencies. In two experiments we show that substituting the LSTM in MDRNNs by these cells works well. Due to this we assume that substituting the LSTM cell by the best performing cell, the LeakyLP cell, will improve the performance of an MDRNN also in other scenarios. Furthermore the new cell types could also be used for the one-dimensional (1D) case, so using them in a bidirectional RNN with LSTMs (BLSTM) could lead to better recognition rates. In Section 2 we introduce the reader to the development of the LSTM cells (S. Hochreiter, 1997) and its extension (F. A. Gers and Cummins, 1999). Based on that in Section 3 we define two properties that probably lead to the good performance of the 1D LSTM cells. Both together guarantee that the cell can have a long term dependency. A third property ensures that gradient cannot explode over time. In Section 4 we show that the MD version of the LSTM is still able to provide long term dependency whereas the gradient can explode easily for dimension greater than 1. In Section 5 we change the architecture of the MD LSTM cell and reduce it to the 1D LSTM cell so that the cell fulfills the two properties for any dimension. Nevertheless the internal cell state can linearly grow over time. This problem is solved in Section 6 using a trainable convex combination of the input and the previous internal cell states. The new cell type can provide long term dependencies and does not suffer from exploding gradients. Motivated by the last sections we introduce a more general way to define MD cells in Section 7. Using the theory of linear shift-invariant systems and their frequency analysis we are able to get a new interpretation of the cells and we create 5 new cell types. To test the performance of the cells in Section 8 we take two data sets from the ICDAR 2009 competitions, where the MDRNNs with LSTM cell won. On these data sets we compare the recognition results of the MDRNNs when we substitute the LSTM cells by the new developed cells. On both data sets, the IFN/ENIT data set and the RIMES data set we can improve the recognition rate using the new developed cells."}, {"heading": "2. Previous Work", "text": "In this section we briefly want to introduce a recurrent neural network (RNN) and the development of the LSTM cell. In previous literature there are various notation to describe the update equations of RNNs an LSTMs. To unify the notations we will refer to their notation using \u201c,\u201d (F. A. Gers and Cummins, 1999; S. Hochreiter, 1997; Graves and Schmidhuber, 2008). Therefore we concentrate on a simple hierarchical RNN with one input layer with the set of neurons I , one recurrent hidden layer with the set of neurons H and one output layer with the set of neurons O. For each time step t \u2208 N the layers are updated asynchronously in the order I,H,O. In one specific layer all neurons can be updated synchronously. In the hidden layer for one neuron c \u2208 H at time t \u2208 N we calculate the neuron\u2019s input activation netc by(\nac(t) , ) netc(t) = \u2211 i\u2208I wc,iyi(t) + \u2211 h\u2208H wc,hyh(t\u2212 1). (1)\nwith weights w[target neuron],[source neuron]. A bias in (1) can be added by extending the set I := I \u222a {bias} with ybias(t) = 1\u2200t \u2208 N and hence we will not write the bias in the equations, but we use them in our RNNs in Section 8. The neuron\u2019s output activation is calculated by(\nyc(t), bc(t) , ) yc(t) = fc (netc(t))\nwith a differentiable sigmoid activation function fc. To make (1) suitable for t \u2264 0 we define \u2200h \u2208 H,\u2200t \u2208 Z \\ N : yh(t) = 0. This simple neuron with a linear function of activations as input and one activation function we call unit (compare to Figure 1). In (1) the activation of the unit is dependent on the current activations of the layer below and the previous activations of the units from the same layer. When there are no recurrent connections (\u2200c, h \u2208 H : wc,h = 0), the layer is called feed-forward layer, otherwise recurrent layer."}, {"heading": "2.1 The Long Short-Term Memory", "text": "A standard LSTM cell c has one input with an input activation ycin(t) a set of gates, one internal state sc and one output(-activation) yc (, yc). The gates are also units and their task is to learn whether a signal should pass the gate or not. They almost always have the logistic activation function\nflog(x) := 1 1+exp(\u2212x) (, f1(x)). The input of the standard LSTM cell is calculated from a unit with an odd activation function with a slope of 1 at x = 0. We use fc(x) = tanh (x) in this paper, another solution could be fc(x) = 2 tanh ( x 2 ) (see S. Hochreiter, 1997). The standard LSTM has two gates: The input gate (IG or \u03b9) and the output gate (OG or \u03c9). These both gates are calculated like a unit, so that\nnet\u03b9(t) = \u2211 i\u2208I w\u03b9,iyi(t) + \u2211 h\u2208H\nw\u03b9,hyh(t\u2212 1)( yinc(t), b\u03b9(t) , ) y\u03b9(t) = flog (net\u03b9(t))\nand\nnet\u03c9(t) = \u2211 i\u2208I w\u03c9,iyi(t) + \u2211 h\u2208H\nw\u03c9,hyh(t\u2212 1)( youtc(t), b\u03c9(t) , ) y\u03c9(t) = flog (net\u03c9(t)) .\nThe input of an LSTM is defined like in (1) by( netc(t) , ) netcin(t) = \u2211 i\u2208I wc,iyi(t) + \u2211 h\u2208H\nwc,hyh(t\u2212 1),( g (netc(t)) , f2 (netc(t)) , ) ycin(t) = fc (netcin(t)) .\nThe internal state sc(t) is calculated by\nsc(t) = ycin(t) \u00b7 y\u03b9(t) + sc(t\u2212 1), (2)\nthe output activation yc(t) of the LSTM is calculated from( yc(t), bc(t) , ) yc(t) = hc (sc(t)) \u00b7 y\u03c9(t) (3)\nwith hc (x) := tanh(x) (, f3(x)). The LSTM can be interpreted as a kind of memory module where the internal state stores the information. For a given input ycin(t) \u2208 (\u22121, 1) the IG \u201cdecides\u201d if the new input is relevant for the internal state. If so, the input is added to the internal state. The information of the input is now saved in the activation of the internal state. The OG determines whether or not the internal activation should be displayed to the rest of the network. So the information, stored in the LSTM is just \u201creadable\u201d when the OG is active. To sum up, an open IG can be seen as a \u201cwrite\u201d-operation into the memory and an open OG as a \u201cread\u201d-operation of the memory.\nAnother way to understand the LSTM is to take a look at the gradient propagated through it. To analyse the LSTM properly, we have to ignore gradients comming from recurrent weights. We define the truncated gradient similar to S. Hochreiter (1997) and F. A. Gers and Cummins (1999).\nDefinition 1 (truncated gradient) Let \u03b3 \u2208 {cin, \u03b9, \u03c9} be any input or gate unit and yc(t\u2212 1) any previous output activation. The truncated gradient differs from the exact gradient only by setting recurrent weighted gradient propagation \u2202net\u03b3(t)\u2202yc(t\u22121) to zero. We write\n\u2202net\u03b3(t)\n\u2202yc(t\u2212 1)\n( = w\u03b3,c ) = tr 0.\nNow, let E be an arbitrary error which is used to train the RNN and \u2202E(t)\u2202yc(t) the resulting derivative at the output of the LSTM. The OG can eliminate the gradient coming from the output, because\n\u2202yc(t) \u2202sc(t) = h\u2032c (sc(t))\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n\u2208(0,1] \u00b7 y\u03c9(t)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 \u2208(0,1) ,\nso the OG decides when the gradient should go into the internal state. Especially for |sc(t)| 1 we get\n\u2202yc(t) \u2202sc(t) \u2248 y\u03c9(t).\nThe key idea of the LSTMs is that an error that occurs at the internal state neither explode nor vanish over time. Therefore, we take a look at the partial derivative \u2202sc(t)\u2202sc(t\u22121) , which is also known as error carousel (for more details see S. Hochreiter, 1997). Using the truncated gradient of Definition 1 for this derivative, we get\n\u2202sc(t)\n\u2202sc(t\u2212 1) =ycin(t) \u00b7\n\u2202y\u03b9(t)\n\u2202sc(t\u2212 1) + y\u03b9(t) \u00b7\n\u2202ycin(t)\n\u2202sc(t\u2212 1) + 1\n=ycin(t) \u00b7 \u2202y\u03b9(t) \u2202yc(t\u2212 1) \u2202yc(t\u2212 1) \u2202sc(t\u2212 1) + y\u03b9(t) \u00b7 \u2202ycin(t) \u2202yc(t\u2212 1) \u2202yc(t\u2212 1) \u2202sc(t\u2212 1) + 1\n=ycin(t) \u00b7 \u2202y\u03b9(t)\n\u2202net\u03b9(t)\n\u2202net\u03b9(t)\n\u2202yc(t\u2212 1)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 = tr 0\n\u2202yc(t\u2212 1) \u2202sc(t\u2212 1)\n+ y\u03b9(t) \u00b7 \u2202ycin(t)\n\u2202netcin(t)\n\u2202netcin(t) \u2202yc(t\u2212 1)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 = tr 0 \u2202yc(t\u2212 1) \u2202sc(t\u2212 1) + 1\n\u21d2 \u2202sc(t) \u2202sc(t\u2212 1) = tr 1. (4)\nSo, once having a gradient at the internal state we can use the chain rule and get \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 N : \u2202sc(t)\u2202sc(t\u2212\u03c4) =tr 1. This is called constant error carousel. Like the OG can eliminate the gradient coming from the LSTM output, the IG can do the same with the gradient coming from the internal state, that means it decides when the gradient should be injected to the source activations. This can be seen by taking a look at the partial derivative\n\u2202sc(t)\n\u2202netcin(t) =\n\u2202sc(t)\n\u2202ycin(t)\n\u2202ycin(t)\n\u2202netcin(t) = y\u03b9(t)f\n\u2032 c (netcin(t)) .\nIf there is a small input |netcin(t)| 1, we get f \u2032c (netcin(t)) \u2248 1 and can estimate\n\u2202sc(t)\n\u2202netcin(t) \u2248 y\u03b9(t).\nAll in all, this LSTM is able to store information and learn long-term dependencies, but it has one drawback which will be discussed in 2.2."}, {"heading": "2.2 Learning to Forget", "text": "For long time series the internal state is unbounded (compare with F. A. Gers and Cummins, 1999, 2.1). Assuming a positive or negative input and a non zero activation of the IG, the absolute activation of the internal state grows over time. Using the weight-space symmetries in a network with at least one hidden layer (Bishop, 2006, 5.1.1) we assume without loss of generality ycin(t) \u2265 0, so sc(t) t\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\u221e. Hence, the activation function hc saturates and (3) can be simplified to\nyc(t) = hc (sc(t))\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 \u21921 y\u03c9(t) \u2248 y\u03c9(t).\nThus, for great activations of sc(t) the whole LSTM works like a unit with a logistic activation function. A similar problem can be observed for the gradient. The gradient coming from the output is multiplied by the activation of the OG and the derivative of hc. For great values of sc(t) we get h\u2032c (sc(t))\u2192 0 and we can estimate the partial derivative\n\u2202yc(t)\n\u2202sc(t) = h\u2032c ((sc(t)) \u00b7 y\u03c9(t) \u2248 0,\nwhich can be interpreted that the OG is not able to propagate back the gradient into the LSTM. Some solutions to solve the linear growing state problem are introduced in F. A. Gers and Cummins (1999). They tried to stabilize the LSTM with a \u201cstate decay\u201d by multiplying the internal state in each time step with a value \u2208 (0, 1), which did not improve the performance. Another solution was to add an additional gate, the forget gate (FG or \u03c6). The last state sc(t \u2212 1) is multiplied by the activation of the FG before it is added to the current state sc(t). So we can substitute (2) by\nsc(t) = ycin(t) \u00b7 y\u03b9(t) + sc(t\u2212 1) \u00b7 y\u03c6(t),\nso that the truncated gradient in (4) is changed to\n\u2202sc(t)\n\u2202sc(t\u2212 1) = ycin(t) \u00b7\n\u2202y\u03b9(t)\n\u2202sc(t\u2212 1) + y\u03b9(t) \u00b7\n\u2202ycin(t)\n\u2202sc(t\u2212 1) + y\u03c6(t)\n= tr y\u03c6(t)\nand for longer time series we get \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 N\n\u2202sc(t)\n\u2202sc(t\u2212 \u03c4) = tr \u03c4\u22121\u220f t\u2032=0 y\u03c6(t\u2212 t\u2032).\nNow, the Extended LSTM is able to learn to forget its previous state. However, an Extended LSTM is still able to work like an standard LSTM without FG by having an activation y\u03c6(t) \u2248 1. In this paper we denote the Extended LSTM as LSTM Another point of view was introduce in Bengio et al. (1994): To learn long-term dependencies a system must have an architecture to that an input can be saved over long time and does not suffer from the \u201cvanishing gradient\u201d problem. On the other hand the system should avoid an \u201cexploding gradient\u201d, which means that a small disturbance has a growing influence over time. In this paper we do not want to solve the problem of vanishing and exploding gradient for a whole system, we want to solve this problem only for one single cell. But we think that it is an necessary condition to provide long time dependencies of a system.\nyI(t) yH(t\u2212 1)\nyI(t) yH(t\u2212 1)"}, {"heading": "3. Cells and Their Properties", "text": "In this section we want to introduce a general cell and figure out properties for these cells which probably lead to the good performance observed by LSTM cells.\nDefinition 2 (Cell, cf. Fig. 2) A cell, c, of order k consists of\n\u2022 one designated input unit, cin, with sigmoid activation function fc (typically fc = tanh unless specified otherwise);\n\u2022 a set \u0393 (not containing cin) of units called gates \u03b31, \u03b32, . . . with sigmoid activation functions f\u03b3i , i = 1, . . . (typically logistic f\u03b3i = flog unless specified otherwise);\n\u2022 an arbitrary function, gint, and a cell activation function, gout, mapping into [\u22121, 1].\nEach unit of \u0393\u222a {cin} receives the same set of input activations. The cell update in time step t \u2208 N is performed in three subsequent phases:\n1. Following the classical update scheme of neurons (see Section 2), all units in \u0393 \u222a {cin} calculate synchronously their activations, which will be denoted by y\u0393(t) := ( y\u03b3(t) ) \u03b3\u2208\u0393 and\nycin(t). Furthermore, we call ycin(t) the input activation of the cell.\nyI(t) yH(t\u2212 1)\nyI(t) yH(t\u2212 1)\nyI(t) yH(t\u2212 1)\n2. Then, the cell computes it\u2019s so-called internal state\nsc(t) := gint (y\u0393(t), ycin(t), sc(t\u2212 1), . . . , sc(t\u2212 k)) .\n3. Finally, the cell computes it\u2019s so-called output activation\nyc(t) := gout (y\u0393(t), ycin(t), sc(t), sc(t\u2212 1), . . . , sc(t\u2212 k)) .\nIn this paper we concentrate on first order cells (k = 1). Now, we use Definition 2 to re-introduce the (Extended) LSTM cell.\nRemark 3 (LSTM cell) An LSTM cell is a cell of order 1 where hc = tanh and\n\u2022 \u0393 = {\u03b9, \u03c6, \u03c9}\n\u2022 sc(t) := gint (y\u0393(t), ycin(t), sc(t\u2212 1)) := ycin(t)y\u03b9(t) + sc(t\u2212 1)y\u03c6(t)\n\u2022 yc(t) := gout (y\u0393(t), sc(t)) := hc (sc(t)) y\u03c9(t)\nProperties of cells. Developing the 1D LSTM cells, the main idea is to save exactly one piece of information over a long time series and to propagate the gradient back over this long time, so that the system can learn precise storage of this piece of information. In instance a given input ycin (which represent the information) at time tin should be stored into the cell state sc until the information is required at time tout. To be able to prove the following properties, we will assume the truncated gradient defined in Definition 1. Nevertheless we will use the full gradient in our Experiments, because it turned out that it works much better. The next two properties of a cell ensure the ability to work as such a memory. The first property should ensure that an input ycin at time tin can be memorized (the cell input is open) in the internal activation sc until tout (the cell memorizes) and has a negligibly influence on the internal activation for t > tout (the cell forgets). In addition, the cell is able to prevent influence of other inputs at time steps t 6= tin (the cell input is closed). Definition 4 (Not vanishing gradient (NVG)) A cell c allows an NVG :\u21d4 For arbitrary tin, tout \u2208 N, tin \u2264 tout, \u2200\u03b4 > 0 there exist gate activations y\u0393(t) such that for any t1, t2 \u2208 N\n\u2202sc (t2)\n\u2202ycin (t1) \u2208 tr\n{ [1\u2212 \u03b4, 1] for t1 = tin and tin \u2264 t2 \u2264 tout\n[0, \u03b4] otherwise (5)\nholds.\nThe next definition guaranties that at any time t \u2208 N the gate activations can (the cell output is open) or not (the cell output is closed) distribute the piece of information saved in sc to the network. This is an important property because the piece of information can be memorized in the cell without presenting it to the network. Note that the decision is just dependent on gate activations at time t and there are no constraints to previous gate activations. In Definition 2 we require yc(t) \u2208 [\u22121, 1] whereas sc(t) \u2208 R. So we cannot have arbitrarily small intervals of the derivative as in (5), but we can ensure two distinct intervals for open and closed cell output. When we take Definition 4 and 5 together, a cell is able to save an input over long term series, can decide at each time step whether or not it is presented to the network and can forget the saved input.\nDefinition 5 (Controllable output dependency (COD)) A cell c of order k allows an COD :\u21d4 There exist \u03b41, \u03b42 \u2208 (0, 1), \u03b42 < \u03b41 so that for any time t \u2208 N there exists a gate vector y\u0393(t) leading to open output dependency\n\u2202yc (t) \u2202sc (t) \u2208 [\u03b41, 1] (6)\nand there exists another gate vector y\u0393(t) leading to a closed output dependency\n\u2202yc (t) \u2202sc (t) \u2208 [0, \u03b42] . (7)\nThe third property is a kind of stability criterion. An unwanted case is that a small change (caused by any noisy signal) at time step tin has a growing influence at later time steps. This is equivalent to an exploding gradient over time. Controlling the gradient of the whole system and avoiding him not to explode is a hard problem. But we can at least avoid the exploding gradient in one cell. This should be prohibited for any gate activations.\nDefinition 6 (Not exploding gradient (NEG)) A cell c has an NEG :\u21d4 For any time steps tin, t \u2208 N, tin < t and any gate activations y\u0393(t) the truncated gradient in bounded by\n\u2202sc (t)\n\u2202sc (tin) \u2208 tr [0, 1] .\nWe think that a cell fulfilling these three properties can work as stable memory. To be able to prove these properties for the LSTM cell we have to considerate the gate activations. In general, the activation function of the gates does not have to be the logistic activation function flog, whereas for this paper we set \u2200\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 : f\u03b3 := flog. So the activation of gates can never be exactly 0 or 1, because of a finite input activation net\u03b3(t) to the gate activation function. But a gate can have an activation y\u03b3(t) \u2208 [1\u2212 \u03b5, 1) if it is opened or y\u03b3(t) \u2208 (0, \u03b5] if it is closed, because for a realistic large input activation net\u03b3(t) \u2265 7 (low input activation net\u03b3(t) < \u22127) we get an activation within the interval y\u03b3(t) \u2208 [1 \u2212 \u03b5, 1) (y\u03b3(t) \u2208 (0, \u03b5]) with \u03b5 < 11000 . Handling with these activation intervals we can prove the definitions for the LSTM cell. Now we can prove whether or not the LSTM cell has these properties.\nTheorem 7 (Properties of the LSTM cell) The 1D LSTM cell allows NVG and has an NEG, but does not allow COD.\nProof see A.1 in appendix."}, {"heading": "4. Expanding to More Dimensions", "text": "In A. Graves and Schmidhuber (2007) the 1D LSTM cell is extended to an arbitrary number of dimensions; this is solved by using one FG for each dimension. In many publications using the MD LSTM cell in MDRNNs outperform state-of-the-art recognition systems (for example see Graves and Schmidhuber, 2008). But by expanding the cell to the MD case, the absolute value of the internal state |sc| can grow faster than linear over time. When\n\u2223\u2223spc \u2223\u2223 \u2192 \u221e and there are peephole connections (for peephole connection details see F. A. Gers and Schmidhuber, 2002), the cells have an output activation of ypc \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1}: The internal state multiplied by the peephole weight overlays the other activationweight-products and this leads to an activation of the OG yp\u03c9 \u2208 {0, 1} and a squashed internal state hc ( spc ) \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. So the output of the cell is yp\u03c9hc ( spc )\n= ypc \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1}. But also without peephole connections the internal state can grow, which leads to hc ( spc ) \u2208 {\u22121, 1} and the cell works like a conventional unit with a logistic activation function yc(t) \u2248 \u00b1y\u03c9(t). Our goal is to transfer the Definitions 4, 5 and 6 defined in Section 3 into the MD case and we will see that the MD LSTM cell has an exploding gradient. In the next sections we will provide alternative cell types, that fulfill two or all of these definitions. In the 1D case it is clear, that there is just one way to come from date t1 to date t2, when t1 < t2, by incrementing t1 as long as t2 is reached. For the MD case the number of paths depends on the number of dimensions and the distance between these two dates. An MD path is defined as follows.\nDefinition 8 (MD path) Let p,q \u2208 ND be two dates. A p-q-path \u03c0 of length k \u2265 0 is a sequence\n\u03c0 := {p = p0, p1, . . . , pk = q}\nwith \u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , k}\u2203!d \u2208 {1, . . . , D} : (pi) \u2212 d = pi\u22121. Further, let \u03c0i := pi.\nWe can define the distance vector\n\u2212\u2192pq := q \u2212 p =  q1 \u2212 p1... qD \u2212 pD  =  \u2212\u2192pq1 ... \u2212\u2192pqD  between the dates p and q . When \u2212\u2192pq has at least one negative component, there exists no p-q-path. Otherwise there exist exactly\n#{\u2212\u2192pq} :=  \u2211Di=1\u2212\u2192pq i \u2212\u2192pq1, . . . ,\u2212\u2192pqD  = (\u2211D i=1 \u2212\u2192pq i ) !\u220fD i=1 \u2212\u2192pq i!\np-q-paths (compare with the multinomial coefficient). We write p < q when #{\u2212\u2192pq} \u2265 1 and p \u2264 q when p = q \u2228 p < q . Now we can extend the definitions of the 1D case to the MD case, whereas we concentrate on the MD cells of order 1.\nDefinition 9 (MD cell) An MD cell, c, of order 1 and dimension D consists of the same parts as a 1D cell of order 1. The cell update in date p \u2208 ND is performed in three subsequent phases:\n1. Following the classical update scheme of neurons (see Section 2), all units in \u0393 \u222a {cin} synchronously calculate their activations, which will be denoted by yp\u0393 = ( yp\u03b3 ) \u03b3\u2208\u0393. Furthermore,\nwe call ypcin the input activation of the cell.\n2. Then, the cell computes it\u2019s so-called internal state\nspc := gint ( yp\u0393, y p cin , s p\u22121 c , . . . , s p\u2212D c ) .\n3. Finally, the cell computes it\u2019s so-called output activation\nypc := gout ( yp\u0393, y p cin , s p c , s p\u22121 c , . . . , s p\u2212D c ) .\nUsing this, we can reintroduce the LSTM cell as well as Definition 4, 5 and 6 for the MD case:\nDefinition 10 (MD LSTM cell) An MD LSTM cell is a cell of dimension D and order 1 where hc = tanh and\n\u2022 \u0393 = {\u03b9, (\u03c6, 1) , . . . , (\u03c6,D) , \u03c9} \u2022 spc = gint ( yp\u0393, y p cin , s p\u22121 c , . . . , s p\u2212D c ) = yp\u03b9 y p cin + D\u2211 d=1 s p\u2212d c y p \u03c6,d\n\u2022 ypc = gout ( yp\u0393, s p c ) = hc ( spc ) yp\u03c9\nDefinition 11 (MD Not vanishing gradient (NVG)) An MD cell c allows an NVG :\u21d4 For arbitrary pin, pout \u2208 ND, pin \u2264 pout,\u2200\u03b4 > 0 there exist \u2200p \u2208 ND gate activations y p \u0393 such that for any p1, p2 \u2208 ND\n\u2202s p2 c \u2202y p1 cin \u2208 tr\n{ [1\u2212 \u03b4, 1] for p1 = pin and pin \u2264 p2 \u2264 pout\n[0, \u03b4] otherwise (8)\nholds.\nDefinition 12 (MD Controllable output dependency (COD)) An MD cell c allows an COD :\u21d4 There exist \u03b41, \u03b42 \u2208 (0, 1), \u03b42 < \u03b41 so that for any time t \u2208 N there exists a gate vector yp\u0393 leading to open output dependency\n\u2202ypc \u2202spc \u2208 [\u03b41, 1] (9)\nand there exists another gate vector yp\u0393 leading to a closed output dependency\n\u2202ypc \u2202spc \u2208 [0, \u03b42] .

Reducing the MD LSTM Cell to One Dimension", "text": "In the last section, we showed that the MD LSTM cell can have an exploding gradient. We tried different ways to solve this problem. For example we divided the activation of the FG by the number of dimensions. Then the gradient cannot explode over time, but the gradient vanishes along some paths rapidly.

Therefore we add an additional peephole connection between the\nsquare value of the previous internal states ( s p\u2212d c )2 and the FGs so that the cell is able to learn that\nit has to close the FG for large internal states.

Therefore, a function\nsp \u2212 c = f ( s p\u22121 c , . . . , s p\u2212D c ) is needed, so that the following two benefits of the 1D LSTM cell remain:\n1. The MD LSTM Stable cell has an NEG\n2.

When D \u2265 2 an MD LSTM Stable cell has one more gate than a classical MD LSTM (for D = 1 the both cells are equivalent). But it is possible to reduce the number of LGs by one.

Bounding the Internal State", "text": "In the last sections we discussed the growing of the EC over time and we found a solution to have a NGEC for higher dimensions.

Again, ideas like state decay, additional peephole connections or additional loss functions like mentioned in Section 4 either do not work or destroy the NVG of the LSTM and LSTM Stable cell. So, our solution is to change the architecture of the MD LSTM Stable cell, so\nthat it fulfills has an NEG and allows NVG and COD. The key idea is to bound the internal state, so that for all inputs \u2223\u2223ypcin\u2223\u2223 \u2264 1, p \u2208 ND the internal state is bounded by \u2223\u2223spc \u2223\u2223 \u2264 1. Note that this is comparable with the well-known Bounded-Input-Bounded-Output-Stability (BIBOStability). To create an MD cell that has an NEG, allows NVG and has a bounded internal state, we take the MD LSTM Stable cell proposed in the last section and change its layout. Therefore we calculate the activation of the IG as function of the FG, so that we achieve\n\u2223\u2223spc \u2223\u2223 \u2264 1 by choosing yp\u03b9 := 1 \u2212 yp\u03c6. So the activation of the FG controls how much leaks from the previous states. The activation of the FG can also be interpreted as switch, if the internal activation, the new activation or a convex combination of these both activations should be stored in the cell. So the sc can be seen as time-dependent exponential moving average of ycin .\nDefinition 19 (MD Leaky cell) An MD Leaky cell is a cell of dimension D and order 1 where hc = tanh and\n\u2022 \u0393 = {(\u03bb, 1) , . . . , (\u03bb,D) , \u03c6, \u03c9}\n\u2022 sp \u2212 c = gconv ( yp\u0393, s p\u22121 c , . . . , s p\u2212D c ) = D\u2211 d=1 s p\u2212d c\nyp\u03bb,d D\u2211 d\u2032=1 yp \u03bb,d\u2032\n\u2022 spc = gint ( yp\u0393, y p cin , s p\u2212 c ) = ( 1\u2212 yp\u03c6 ) ypcin + s p\u2212 c y p \u03c6\n\u2022 ypc = gout ( yp\u0393, s p c ) = yp\u03c9hc ( spc )\nNow we can prove that the resulting cell has all benefits.\nTheorem 20 The MD Leaky cell has an NEG and allows NVG and COD.\nProof See A.6 in appendix.\nThe MD Leaky cell can have one gate less than the MD LSTM cell and the MD LSTM Stable cell and because of this, the update path requires less computations."}, {"heading": "7. General Derivation of Leaky Cells", "text": "So far we proposed cells for the MD case, which are able to provide long term memory. But especially in MDRNNs with more than one MD layer it is hard to measure if and how much long term dependencies are used and even if it is useful. Another way to interpret the cell is to consider them as kind of MD feature extractor like \u201cfeature maps\u201d in Convolutional Neural Networks (Bengio and LeCun, 1995). Then the aim is to construct an MD cell which is able to generate useful features. Having a hierarchical Neural Network like in Bengio and LeCun (1995) and Graves and Schmidhuber (2008) over the hierarchies the number of features increases with a simultaneously decreasing feature resolution. Features in a layer with low resolution can be seen as low frequency features in comparison to features in a layer with high resolution. So it would be useful to construct a cell as feature extractor which produces a low frequency output in comparison to its input. In appendix B we take a closer look at the theory of linear shift invariant (LSI)-systems and their frequency analysis and analyse a first order LSI-system regarding its free selectable parameters using the Fand Z-transform. There, we derive the MD LeakyLP cell (see Definition 21) and 5 additional first order MD cells, which we do not test in Section 8.\nDefinition 21 (MD LeakyLP cell) An MD LeakyLP cell is a cell of dimensionD and order 1 where hc = tanh and\n\u2022 \u0393 = {(\u03bb, 1) , . . . , (\u03bb,D) , \u03c6, \u03c90, \u03c91}\n\u2022 sp \u2212 c = gconv ( yp\u0393, s p\u22121 c , . . . , s p\u2212D c ) = D\u2211 d=1 s p\u2212d c\nyp\u03bb,d D\u2211 d\u2032=1 yp \u03bb,d\u2032\n\u2022 spc = gint ( yp\u0393, y p cin , s p\u2212 c ) = ( 1\u2212 yp\u03c6 ) ypcin + s p\u2212 c y p \u03c6 \u2022 ypc = gout ( yp\u0393, s p c , s p\u2212 c ) = hc ( spcy p \u03c90 + s p\u2212 c y p \u03c91\n) Setting the second OG (yp\u03c91) to zero, the LeakyLP cell corresponds to the Leaky cell, hence it fulfills all three properties, but has one more gate, which is as much gates as the LSTM cell."}, {"heading": "8. Experiments", "text": "RNNs with 1D LSTM cells are well studied. In some experiments the activations of the gates and the internal state are observed and one can see that the cell can really learn, when to \u201cforget\u201d information and when the internal state should be accessible for the network (see F. A. Gers and Schmidhuber, 2002). However, we did not find experiments like these for the MD case and we do not want to transfer these experiments into the MD case. Instead we compare the different cell types with each other in two scenarios where the MD RNNs with LSTM cells perform very well. In both benchmarks the task is to transcribe a handwritten text on an image, so we have a 2D RNN. In this case we compare the cells on the IFN/ENIT (Pechwitz et al., 2002) and the Rimes database (Augustin et al., 2006). Both tasks are solved with the MD RNN layout described in Graves and Schmidhuber (2008) and shown in Figure 4. All networks are trained with Backpropagation through time (BPTT) . To compare the different cell types in RNNs with each other we take 10 RNNs with different weight initializations of each cell type and calculate the minimum, the maximum and the median of the best label error rate (LER) on a validation set of these 10 RNNs. In all tables we present these three LERs to compare the cell types. We think it is more important to have stable cells in the lower MD layers because of two reasons: First, when we have just a few cells in a layer, the saturation of one cell has a greater effect on the performance of the network. Second, in lower layers there are longer time series so having an unstable cell in such a layer, it has time to saturate. So our first experiment compares the recognition results when we substitute the LSTM cells in the lowest layer (which is \u201c2D layer 1\u201d in Figure 4) by the newly developed cells. In the second experiment we compare the LSTM cell and the LeakyLP cell also in the higher MD layers (\u201c2D layer 2 and 3 in Figure 4), to evaluate if the LeakyLP cell work better also in long time series. In Bengio (2012, 3.1.1) it is mentioned, that an important hyper parameter for a training is the learning rate, so another experiment is to train all networks with stochastic gradient decent with different learning rates \u03b4 \u2208 { 1 \u00b7 10\u22123, 5 \u00b7 10\u22124, 2 \u00b7 10\u22124, 1 \u00b7 10\u22124 } and compare the best LER according a fixed learning rate."}, {"heading": "8.1 The IFN/ENIT Database", "text": "This database contains handwritten names of towns and villages of Tunisia.

So we cannot say, that LeakyLP is always better. But it can be observed that the variance of the RNN performance is very high with LSTM cells in the lowest MD layer. Our interpretation is that LSTM cells have a comparable performance like the LeakyLP cells in the lowest layer, when they do not saturate.

The best results can be achieved when we use LeakyLP cells in 2D layer 1 and LSTM cells in 2D layer 3.

Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we took a look at the one-dimensional LSTM cell and discussed the benefits of this cell. We found two properties, that probably make these cells so powerful in the one dimensional case. Expanding these properties to the multi dimensional case, we saw that the LSTM does not fulfill one of these properties any more. We solved this problem by changing the architecture of the cell. In addition we presented a more general idea how to create one dimensional or multi dimensional cells. We compare some newly developed cells with the LSTM cell on two data sets and we can improve the performance using the new cell types. Due to this we think that substituting the multidimensional LSTM cells by the multi-dimensional LeakyLP cell could improve the performance of many system working with a multi-dimensional space."}, {"heading": "Appendix A.

(14)\nWe will prove the properties successively. NEG: For the LSTM cell the FG f\u03c6 = flog ensures y\u03c6(t) \u2208 (0, 1), so using these bounds in (13) with\n\u2202sc (t)\n\u2202sc (tin) = tr t\u220f t\u2032=tin+1 y\u03c6(t \u2032) \u2208 (0, 1)\nthe LSTM cell has an NEG. NVG: Therefore, we choose\ny\u03b9 (t) \u2208 {\n[1\u2212 \u03b5, 1) if t = tin (0, \u03b5] otherwise ,\ny\u03c6 (t) \u2208 {\n[1\u2212 \u03b5, 1) if tin < t \u2264 tout (0, \u03b5] otherwise ,\nwith a later chosen \u03b5 > 0. Let t1, t2 \u2208 N, t1 \u2264 t2 be two arbitrary dates, where we want to calculate the gradient \u2202sc(t2)\u2202ycin (t1)\n. First, we want to show that the LSTM cell allows NVG for t1 = tin and tin \u2264 t2 \u2264 tout: We have y\u03b9(t1) \u2208 [1\u2212 \u03b5, 1) and \u2200t = tin + 1, . . . , tout : y\u03c6(t) \u2208 [1\u2212 \u03b5, 1). Then, we can estimate the derivative from (12) and (14) by\n\u2202sc (t2) \u2202ycin (t1) = \u2202sc (t2) \u2202sc (t1) \u2202sc (t1) \u2202ycin (t1) = tr y\u03b9 (t1) t2\u220f t=t1+1 y\u03c6 (t)\n\u2208 tr\n[ (1\u2212 \u03b5)\nt2\u220f t=t1+1 (1\u2212 \u03b5) , 1\n) \u2286 [ (1\u2212 \u03b5)tout\u2212tin+1 , 1 ) .\nTo fulfill the equation for NVG we choose \u03b5 depending on \u03b4 such that\n1\u2212 \u03b4 \u2264 (1\u2212 \u03b5)tout\u2212tin+1\n\u21d4 \u03b5 \u2264 1\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b4) 1 tout\u2212tin+1\nholds. Second, we have to show, that the derivative is in [0, \u03b4], when t1 = tin and tin \u2264 t2 \u2264 tout is not fulfilled. In the case of t1 6= tin when \u03b5 \u2264 \u03b4 we can use the NEG which leads to\n\u2202sc (t2) \u2202ycin (t1) = \u2202sc (t2)\n\u2202sc (t1)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 \u2208 tr [0,1]\n\u2202sc (t1)\n\u2202ycin (t1)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 \u2208(0,\u03b5]\n\u2286 [0, \u03b5] \u2286 [0, \u03b4].\nWhen t1 = tin we have two cases: t2 < tin or t2 > tout. For the case t2 < tin the derivative is zero (\u2282 [0, \u03b4]), because the cell is causal. For t2 > tout we can split the derivative at tout and get\n\u2202sc (t2)\n\u2202ycin (t1) = tr y\u03b9(t1) tout\u220f t=t1+1\ny\u03c6(t)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 \u2208(0,1)\nt2\u220f t=tout+1 y\u03c6(t)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 \u2208(0,\u03b5]\n\u2208 tr\n( 0, \u03b5t2\u2212tout ] \u2282 [0, \u03b5] \u2286 [0, \u03b4].\nFor \u03b5 \u2264 min { \u03b4, 1\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b4) 1 tout\u2212tin+1 } the LSTM cell allows NVG.\nCOD: To prove that the LSTM cell has no COD, we show that there are gate activations such that in Definition 5 we get \u03b42 > \u03b41. Therefore, we assume that all gate activations are arbitrary (y\u03b3(t) \u2208 (0, 1)), closed (y\u03b3(t) \u2208 (0, \u03b5]) or opened (y\u03b3(t) \u2208 [1 \u2212 \u03b5, 1)) with a later chosen \u03b5 > 0. We take a look at the right side of (14). For sc(t) = 0 we get h\u2032c (sc(t)) = 1. In Definition 5 we have to satisfy \u2203y\u0393(t) : \u2202yc(t)\u2202sc(t) \u2208 [0, \u03b42] an choose the OG y\u03c9(t) \u2208 (0, \u03b5] with\n\u03b5 \u2264 \u03b42.
