Introduction Transcription of broadcast news has been an active topic of research in the last decade. Various languages apart from English [1, 2] have been covered, including Arabic [3], French [4], German [5, 6], and Mandarin [7, 8]. The process of full transcription is usually divided into a segmentation and speech recognition step: first, the audio signal is segmented into speech and nonspeech parts (e. g. music), and then the speech parts are decoded by a speech recogniser [9].\nIn this paper, we do not aim at a full-featured transcription system, but rather focus on the challenge of speakerindependent German large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR), using a broadcast news speech corpus for evaluation. This corpus was originally created at Duisburg University in the context of the ALERT project, and used as a whole for training a broadcast news transcription system [5]. In that study the test set was rather small and not clearly specified. In contrast, this paper proposes a suitable corpus structure for systematic tuning and evaluation of a German LVCSR system, including subdivision into training, development, and test sets. We believe that provision of the corpus will be a valuable contribution for the engineering of speech recognition tools for diverse applications in the future, since recognition of German broadcast news is a considerably challenging application for LVCSR: on the one hand, recognition of broadcast news has to utilise large dictionaries to avoid frequent out-of-vocabulary events; on the other hand, it has to deal with the pecularities of the German language, such as frequent inflection (e. g. German einen or einem = English a(n)) and complex compound words (e. g. German Spracherkennungsproblem = English speech recognition problem) [6].\nOur work focused on structuring and preparing the German speech data available from the ALERT project into a corpus suitable for evaluation of speaker-independent LVCSR systems (Section 2), assessing the benefit of different acoustic feature sets (Section 3), and fine-tuning of the decoding parameters (Section\n4) with respect to the trade-off between real-time factor (RTF) and word error rate (WER). We will present the results of our experiments in Section 5, and show that real-time processing on a state-of-the-art PC is feasible at a WER of less than 10 %, which is lower than the ones typically found in previous works on transcription of German broadcast news."}, {"heading": "2. The Broadcast News Corpus", "text": "The Broadcast News (BCN) Corpus was recorded in 2000\u201301 at Duisburg University and consists of over 160 hours of German speech, including mainly radio broadcasts, but also news on television (Tagesschau). For the television parts, video is available as an additional modality, e. g. for audiovisual speech recognition, but was not considered in our experiments. Audio is sampled at 16 kHz with 16-bit PCM encoding. The audio files each correspond to a broadcast with several minutes length. The segmentation and transcription is contained in a flexible XML file format that is illustrated in Figure 1: first, each of the audio files is coarsely divided into sections, corresponding e. g. to jingles at the beginning of the broadcast, or speech parts. Each speech part is segmented into turns of different speakers which are listed at the beginning of the file. Gender information could be used to train specific acoustic models, which we leave as a topic for further experiments. Each turn corresponds to one or several news messages read by one speaker and is transcribed on the word level, using reference texts from the web sites of the radio and TV stations whenever available. Manually created alignments (sync times) divide the turns into utterances, which usually correspond to complete news messages and hence contain a few sentences. The average utterance length in the corpus is 80 words. Alignments are also provided whenever the background condition (clean speech, music, background noise, or a combination of them) changes, which allows further partitioning of the utterances into segments with only a specified background condition. Finally, signal segments with low speech quality \u2013 due to transmission or microphone problems \u2013 are also identified. We divided the utterances from the clean speech parts into a training, development, and test set, ignoring the low-quality segments (approx. 1.4 % of the total utterance length). We realised the constraint of speaker-independency by choosing these sets such that no radio or TV channel occurs in more than one set. The recording length and number of utterances for the three sets is shown in Table 1, while the number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) entries is outlined in Table 2 for a 148 K language model vocabulary size."}, {"heading": "3. Feature Extraction", "text": "To be able to measure how recognition performance is affected by different acoustic features, we extracted three feature sets.\nar X\niv :1\n41 2.\n46 16\nv1 [\ncs .C\nL ]\n1 5\nD ec\n2 01\n4\nA baseline set contained Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) 1\u201312 and signal log-energy, and their first (\u03b4) and second order regression coefficients (\u03b4\u03b4), which were extracted using the openEAR feature extractor [10], and are identical to the features extracted by the HTK toolkit [11].\nNext, this feature set was augmented by 12 Line Spectral Pairs (LSP), along with their \u03b4 and \u03b4\u03b4 coefficients, computed with openEAR. To reduce the number of parameters that had to be estimated for the acoustic models, and to have feature sets of comparable dimension, we applied Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to the 75-dimensional feature vectors. For PCA, we computed the covariance matrix of the training set when testing with the development set, or the one of the union of training and development set when testing with the test set. The feature space was reduced by considering only the first N eigenvalues (in descending magnitude) \u03bb1, . . . , \u03bbN such that\u2211N\ni=1 \u03bbi\u221175 i=1 \u03bbi \u2265 0.9999, (1)\nand choosing the corresponding eigenvectors as basis. For both cases (training set or union of training and development set), the resulting dimensionality was N = 38. The final features will be denoted by MFCC-LSP-PCA.\nFinally, as a third feature set, we chose the Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP) coefficients 1\u201312 along with log-energy and their \u03b4 and \u03b4\u03b4 coefficients, computed with HTK [11].\n4. Acoustic and Language Models\nIn contrast to previous work on German broadcast data [5] using the \u201cDucoder\u201d stack decoder [12], we implemented a LVCSR system on top of HDecode [11]. Our acoustic models included tied-state Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with three emitting states, corresponding to decision-tree clustered cross-word triphones built from 54 monophone models. Apart from 51 models for the common German phoneme alphabet and silence, the monophones also included a model for the nasal en vowel that quite frequently occurs in German due to a considerable number of French foreign words (e. g. Arrangement). Two additional models were needed for technical reasons: a \u2018garbage\u2019 phoneme model was trained to model out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in the training set, in order to be able to use all available utterances from the training set. Also, due to utterances containing multiple sentences in the corpus, it was necessary to introduce an additional \u2018within-utterance\u2019 silence model (\u2018full stop\u2019), because the HDecode decoder assumes an end of turn once \u2018standard\u2019 silence is detected. After building the tied-state triphones, Gaussian mixtures (GM) were split until each state had 8 GMs, with an additional split for silence (16 GMs).\nAs has been shown in [5], using a domain-specific language model (LM) can vastly increase recognition rate. For our experiments, we built a trigram LM from the archive of the German newspaper taz (die tageszeitung), consisting of 633 611 articles from the years 1986-2000 with 185.9 million words in total. For the 148.5 K LM vocabulary, pronunciations were taken from a semi-automatically generated dictionary. Notably, for lower vocabulary sizes the OOV rate increased significantly (see Table 3). To match the structure of the utterance annotation appropriately with the LM, we replaced the full stops in the articles by a word corresponding to the aforementioned \u2018within-utterance\u2019 silence model. We ended up with an LM size of approx. 400 megabytes in ARPA format, hence the LM fits well into the memory of a state-of-the-art PC, and for our purpose no special effort to cope with memory requirements was needed, unlike in [12]. Table 4 shows the perplexity \u2013 measured by the method described in [11] \u2013 of the transcription of the training, development, and test sets, and the BCN corpus as a whole, using the unigram, bigram, and trigram LM.\n5. Experimental Results We defined suitable ranges for the decoding parameters on the development set: the word insertion penalty used by HDecode was set to a log probability of -4.0, the HDecode beam width was chosen between 170.0 and 250.0, and values of the LM scale factor between 12.0 and 20.0. Then, we joined the training and development sets and evaluated different combinations of these parameters on the test set. First, Figure 2 shows the WER for the three different feature sets (Section 3) at various beam widths of the decoder (170.0, 180.0, 190.0, 200.0, 225.0, and 250.0). With the minimal pruning (beam width 250.0) and PLP features, a WER of 8.1 % can be achieved. Comparing the results with different feature sets, it can be seen that while a WER of below 10 % is feasible for all three feature sets, the overall picture clearly shows that PLP outperform MFCC and the combination of MFCC and LSP reduced by PCA. The latter exhibit the lowest performance in the test scenario.\nNext, Figure 3 shows the trade-off between WER and RTF, again for the three different feature sets. It is remarkable that the 39 MFCC and PLP features are approximately on par concerning RTF, while the 38 PCA features from MFCC and LSP significantly increase the RTF needed for a given WER. Note that in this figure, different RTFs resulted from using the various aforementioned pruning settings, and were computed as the quotient of the total CPU time used by HDecode on the test set and the total utterance length of the test set. The measurement of CPU time was carried out with HTK 3.4 on a Linux PC with a 3.0 GHz AMD Phenom II X4 processor and 8 GB of RAM. Only one of the four cores was used for each decoding process. For the results in Figure 2 and 3, the LM scale factor was 15.0.\nVariation of the LM scale factor is another method to finetune the trade-off between WER and RTF: Figure 4 depicts the WER induced by different scale factors, while Figure 5 shows the trade-off between WER and RTF in analogy to Figure 3, but varying the LM scale factor instead of the beam width. Here, PLP features were used. Opposing Figure 5 and Figure 3, one can see that variation of the beam width at a constant LM scale factor of 15.0 is more beneficial for improving the trade-off between WER and RTF than keeping the beam width constant (200.0) and varying the LM scale factor. In the latter case, a higher WER of 9.7 % has to be accepted for real-time decoding (with an LM scale factor of 17.0), compared to a WER of about 9.2 % achieved by a beam width of 190.0. Furthermore, a RTF of 0.67 at a WER of 10.82 % can be achieved by a beam width of 170.0, while accomplishing a RTF of 0.79 by a LM scale factor\nof 20.0 induces a WER of 14.10 %. As a final note concerning WER, it is noteworthy that sometimes calculation of WER for German speech takes into account equivalence classes for compound words [6]. That is, if the reference transcription contains the word Sportveranstaltung (sports event) and the decoder splits it up into the sequence Sport Veranstaltung, this is not considered erroneous (more precisely, as one insertion and one substitution). However, we calculate WER without using such equivalence classes, for two reasons: first, we believe that the decoder should produce an orthographically correct transcription, which Sport Veranstaltung is not; second, it is expected that compound words are pronounced without pauses, which the system should be able to detect. The \u2018full stop\u2019 word (Section 4) was however ignored in computation of accuracy."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions", "text": "We presented a corpus of German broadcast news for fine-tuning and evaluation of German LVCSR systems, focusing on the\ndecoding of clean speech. Using a decoding system based on state-of-the-art LVCSR research and a LM vocabulary size of 148 K, we achieved a word error rate of about 9 % in real-time on a desktop PC. Different feature sets were evaluated, whereby PLP coefficients showed the best performance. Furthermore, we extensively fine-tuned the decoding parameters, and identified the beam widths and LM scale factors needed to achieve various real-time factors. Comparing our results to previous work on broadcast news transcription, we conclude that our results are competitive, especially given that German is a considerably challenging language for LVCSR applications. Naturally, comparisons with previous studies must be done very carefully, as our results were achieved on manually segmented data, and capabilities of PC hardware have developed at a fast pace in the last decade.\nIn the future, we will use the BCN corpus to evaluate novel\nhybrid decoders and approaches for feature extraction, e. g. decoders using bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural networks or features generated by non-negative matrix factorisation. While both of these have been successfully used in whole-word recognition tasks [13], it will be an interesting research topic to assess their usefulness for German LVCSR.\n7.
