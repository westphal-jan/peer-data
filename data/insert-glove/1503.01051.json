For example, our judgments on two similarly modelled cases may differ depending on whether it takes place in a moral context or a purely mechanical one, or on whether what we take to be the default setting, or on whether we take something to be a background condition or not, etc. (Knobe and Fraser 2008; Moore 2009; Hitchcock and Knobe 2009). This has led HH to develop a flexible framework that allows room for incorporating different judgments on actual causation. More specifically, in their view the difference between cases that are modelled using similar structural models depends on\nwhich worlds we take to be more normal than others in the different contexts. Therefore their solution is to extend structural models with a normality ranking on worlds, and use it to adapt and order our judgments of actual causation in a manner suited for the particular context.\nWe sympathize with many of their observations, and we agree that normality considerations do influence our causal judgments. However, we find their representation of normality lacking for two reasons. First, although they emphasize the importance of distinguishing between statistical and normative normality, they use a single ranking for both. Second, they refrain from using probabilities to represent statistical normality, and instead work with a partial preorder over worlds. In this paper we offer an alternative, in which statistical normality is represented in the usual way, i.e., by means of probabilities. As we will show, such a quantitative representation of statistical normality avoids a number of problems that HH\u2019s ordinal representation runs into. To cope with normative normality, we introduce a separate notion of norms. As a technical tool for our analysis, we will use a normative extension of a general framework for the study of actual causation (Beckers and Vennekens ) that was defined in the language of CP-logic (Causal Probabilistic logic) (Vennekens, Denecker, and Bruynooghe 2009). An important property of our technical approach is that we implement the concept of normality by means of a syntactic transformation, similar to how previous work has defined the concept of interventions in CP-logic (Vennekens, Denecker, and Bruynooghe 2010). This allows us to improve on the HH approach, by properly accommodating the counterfactual nature of causation. The result will be a more generally applicable and yet simpler approach.\nIn Section 2 we shortly present the formal language of CP-logic and use it to formulate a definition of actual causation. The following section presents the extension to actual causation by HH. We translate their work into the CP-logic framework in Section 4. Section 5 contains a first improvement to this translation, followed by some examples and our final extension to actual causation in Section 6.\nWe will use the following story from (Knobe and Fraser 2008) as our running example, as it illustrates the influence normative considerations can have on our causal attributions:\nThe receptionist in the philosophy department keeps\nher desk stocked with pens. The administrative assistants are allowed to take pens, but faculty members are supposed to buy their own. The administrative assistants typically do take the pens. Unfortunately, so do the faculty members. The receptionist repeatedly e-mailed them reminders that only administrators are allowed to take the pens. On Monday morning, one of the administrative assistants encounters professor Smith walking past the receptionists desk. Both take pens. Later, that day, the receptionist needs to take an important message...but she has a problem. There are no pens left on her desk."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries: CP-logic", "text": "We give a short, informal introduction to CP-logic. A detailed description can be found in (Vennekens, Denecker, and Bruynooghe 2009; 2010). The basic syntactical unit of CP-logic is a CP-law, which takes the general form of Head \u2190 Body. The body can in general consist of any firstorder logic formula. However, in this paper, we restrict our attention to grounded formulas in CNF. The head contains a disjunction of atoms annotated with probabilities, representing the possible effects of this law. When the probabilities in a head do not add up to one, we implicitly assume an empty disjunct, annotated with the remaining probability.\nEach CP-law models a specific causal mechanism. Informally, we take this to mean that, if the Body of the law is satisfied, then at some point it will be applied, meaning one of the disjuncts in the Head is chosen, each with their respective probabilities. If a disjunct is chosen containing an atom that is not yet true, then this law causes it to become true; otherwise, the law has no effect. A finite set of such CP-laws forms a CP-theory, and represents the causal structure of the domain at hand. The domain unfolds by laws being applied one after another, where multiple orders are often possible, and each law is applied at most once. To illustrate this, we describe the relevant events on the Monday morning from our running example. The domain consists of the variables Pro f and Assistant, which stand for the professor respectively the assistant taking a pen, and NoPens, which is true when there are no pens left. The causal structure can be represented by the following CP-theory T :\n(Pro f : 0.7)\u2190 . (1)\n(Assistant : 0.8)\u2190 . (2)\nNoPens \u2190 Pro f \u2227Assistant. (3)\nThe first two of these causal laws are vacuous (i.e, they will be applied in every story) and non-deterministic. The first one results in either the professor taking the pen, or nothing at all. Since it is stated that professors typically do take pens, we simply chose some probability above 0.5. Similarly, the second law describes the possible behaviour of the assistant. The last law is deterministic, i.e., it only has one possible outcome (where we leave implicit the probability 1).\nThe given theory summarizes all possible stories that can take place in this model. One of those is what in fact did happen that Monday morning: both the professor and the assistant take a pen, leaving the receptionist faced with no\npens. The other stories consist in only the professor taking a pen, only the assistant doing so, or neither.\nTo formalize this idea, the semantics of CP-logic uses probability trees (Shafer 1996). For this example, one such tree is shown in Figure 1. Here, each node represents a state of the domain, which is characterized by an assignment of truth values to the atomic formulas, in this case Pro f , Assistant and NoPens. In the initial state of the domain (the root node), all atoms are assigned their default value false. In this example, initially there are still pens left, and neither the professor nor the assistant have taken one. The children of a node x are the result of the application of a law: each edge (x,y) corresponds to a specific disjunct that was chosen from the head of the law that was applied in node x. Because in this particular tree the professor arrives first, there are two child-nodes, corresponding to the law (1) being applied and resulting in a pen being taken (left child) or not (right child). In the former case, the assignment is updated by setting Pro f to true, its deviant value. Similarly, the subsequent nodes represent the possible outcomes of the application of law (2), and whether or not this results in the lack of pens. The leftmost branch is thus the formal counterpart of the above story. A probability tree of a theory T defines an a priori probability distribution PT over all stories that might happen in this domain, which can be read off the leaf nodes of the branches by multiplying the probabilities on the edges. For instance, the probability of our example story is 0.56. We have shown here only one such probability tree, but we can construct another one as well by applying the laws in different orders.\nAn important property however is that all trees defined by the same theory result in the same probability distribution. To ensure that this property holds even when there are bodies containing negative literals, CP-logic makes use of the well-founded semantics. Simply put, this means the condition for a law to be applied in a node is not merely that its body is currently satisfied, but that this will remain so. This implies that a negated atom in a body should not only be currently assigned false, but actually has to have become impossible, so that it will remain false through to the endstate. For atoms currently assigned true, it always holds that they remain true, hence here there is no problem."}, {"heading": "2.1 Operations on CP-theories", "text": "We specify some operations on CP-logic theories that will be used throughout this paper. Assume we have a theory T and a branch b of one of T \u2019s probability trees, such that both C and E hold in its leaf. To make T deterministic in accordance with the choices made in b, means to transform T into T b by replacing the heads of the laws that were applied in b with the disjuncts which were chosen from those heads in b.\nFor our example story b, T b is:\nPro f \u2190 . (4)\nAssistant \u2190 . (5)\nNoPens \u2190 Pro f \u2227Assistant. (6)\nWe will use Pearl\u2019s do()-operator to indicate an intervention (Pearl 2000). The intervention on a theory T that makes variable C false, denoted by do(\u00acC), removes C from the head of any law in which it occurs, yielding T |do(\u00acC). For example, to prevent the professor from taking a pen, the resulting theory T |do(\u00acPro f ) is given by:\n\u2190 . (7)\n(Assistant : 0.8)\u2190 . (8)\nNoPens \u2190 Pro f \u2227Assistant. (9)\nLaws with an empty head, such as (7), can also simply be omitted. The analogous operation do(C) on a theory T corresponds to adding the deterministic law C \u2190."}, {"heading": "2.2 Actual Causation in CP-logic", "text": "In recent years many proposals for defining actual causation have entered the scene, such as (Hall and Paul 2003; Hall 2004; 2007; Halpern and Pearl 2005; Vennekens 2011; Beckers and Vennekens 2012). In (Beckers and Vennekens ) we developed a general definition, which encompasses several of these. The idea behind our general definition is that one should first modify the theory T into a theory T \u2217 that takes into account the influence of the actual story b, and then judge causation by using the probabilistic extension of counterfactual dependence. The available operations to construct T \u2217 are to make laws deterministic in accordance with the choices made in b, and to remove laws. A specific definition is obtained by specifying which laws fall under the first category \u2013 called the intrinsic laws and noted as Int \u2013 and those which fall under the second \u2013 called the irrelevant laws and noted as Irr.1 We then construct T \u2217 as T \\ (Irr\u222a Int)\u222a Intb.\nDefinition 1. [Actual causation] Given a theory T and a branch b such that both C and E hold in its leaf. We define that C is an actual cause of E in (T,b) if and only if PT\u2217(\u00acE|do(\u00acC))> 0.\nIf desired, the degree to which different events actually caused some effect can then be further compared by comparing their associated probabilities.\nHH use the HP-definition (Halpern and Pearl 2005) as their working definition to illustrate their extension to actual causation. However, they stress the generality of their\n1These specifications are implicitly parametrized with regard to a theory, a story, and events C and E.\napproach, and mention that one could for example apply it to Hall\u2019s definition from (Hall 2007). In (Beckers and Vennekens ), we reformulated Hall\u2019s definition as an instantation of the general definition here presented. We will choose this reformulation to work with in this paper, because this makes it easier to apply the current discussion to other instantiations.\nBy Lea fb we denote the set of true variables in the leaf of a branch b. For a law r that was applied in b, we call the node in b that results from its application Nodebr . Our working definition states that no laws are irrelevant, and determines the intrinsic laws as follows:\nIntrinsic. A non-deterministic law r of T that was applied in b is intrinsic iff there is no branch d passing through a sibling of Nodebr such that {C,E} \u2286 Lea fd \u2286 Lea fb.\nIf we look at the probability tree in Figure 1, we see that E = NoPens only occurs in Lea fb, and hence both the laws (1) and (2) are intrinsic. This gives T \u2217 = T b. As there is counterfactual dependency of NoPens on both Assistant and Pro f , they are full causes. However it was shown in (Knobe and Fraser 2008) that most people do not judge the assistant to be a cause, or at least far less so than the professor is. This illustrates how our causal judgment can be influenced by normative considerations."}, {"heading": "3 The HH Extension to Actual Causation", "text": "In this section we succinctly present the graded, contextdependent approach to actual causation from (Halpern and Hitchcock ). As with much work on actual causation, HH frame their ideas using structural models. Such a model consists of a set of equations, one for each endogenous variable, that express the functional dependencies of the endogenous variables on others. These dependencies are acyclic, and have their roots in the exogenous variables. HH only consider structural models with two types of (Boolean) endogenous variables: the ones that deterministically depend on other endogenous variables, and those that depend directly on exogenous variables.\nHH take a world to be an assignment to all endogenous variables. Given a structural model, each assignment u of the exogenous variables \u2013 a so-called context \u2013 determines a unique world, denoted by su.\nAn extended structural model (M, ) consists of a structural model M together with a normality ranking over worlds. This ranking is a partial pre-order informed by our \u2013 possibly subjective \u2013 judgments about what we take to be normal in this context. It is derived by considering the typicality of the values the variables in a world take. For the variables that depend only on other endogenous variables, things are straightforward: it is typical that these variables take the value dictated by their deterministic equation. For the other variables, i.e., those that depend only on the exogenous variables, their possible values are ranked according to typicality. A world s is more normal than s\u2032 if there is at least one variable that takes a more typical value in s than it does in s\u2032, and no variable takes a less typical value. Typicality and normality are meant to encompass both statistical and normative judgments. Although HH make no syntactic\ndistinction between the two kinds of normality, in the examples discussed they do differentiate between them informally. We will also make a formal distinction between the two, because in this manner we can incorporate information regarding both.\nSay we have a story, i.e., an assignment to all variables, such that C and E happen in it. In order to establish whether C is a cause of E , any definition in the counterfactual tradition restricts itself to some particular set of counterfactual worlds in which \u00acC holds and checks whether also \u00acE holds in these worlds. If this set contains a world which serves to justify that C is indeed a cause of E , then HH call such a world a witness of this. HH adapt a given definition of actual causation using the normality ranking to disallow worlds that are less normal than the actual world, in order to reflect the influence of normality on possible causes.\nDefinition 2. [HH-extension of actual causation.] Given are an extended structural model (M, ) and context u, such that both C and E hold in su. C is an HH-actual cause of E in (M, ,u) iff C is an actual cause of E in (M,u) when we consider only witnesses w such that w su.\nSince we have a ranking on the normality of worlds, this definition straightforwardly leads to an ordering between different causes indicating the strength of the causal relationship by looking at the highest ranked witness for a cause, which is called its best witness.\nIn case of our example, we get that {\u00acPro f ,Assistant,\u00acNoPens} \u227b {Pro f ,Assistant,NoPens} \u227b {Pro f ,\u00acAssistant,\u00acNoPens}. Since the actual world is in the middle, the first of these can serve as a witness for Pro f being a cause, but the last may not be used to judge Assistant to be a cause."}, {"heading": "4 The HH Extension in CP-logic", "text": "We proceed with translating the HH-extension of actual causation into CP-logic. To get there, we will translate one by one all of the required concepts.\nA structural model M in the HH-setting corresponds to a CP-theory T : a direct dependency on the exogenous variables results in a non-deterministic, vacuous law (such as (1) and (2)), while a dependency on only endogenous variables results in a deterministic law (such as (3)).\nA world s described by M then corresponds to a branch b \u2013 or to be more precise, the leaf of a branch \u2013 of a probability tree of T . In Def. 2 we restrict an extended structural model to those worlds that are at least as normal as the actual world. The CP-logic-equivalent of this will be the normal refinement of T according to b, which is a theory that describes those stories which are at least as normal as b.\nFirst we introduce two operations on CP-laws, corresponding to the two different interpretations of normality. Assume at some point a CP-law r was applied in b, choosing the disjunct rb that occurs in its head.\nOn a probabilistic reading, an alternative application of r is at least as normal as the actual one if a disjunct is chosen which is at least as likely as rb. Therefore the probabilistically normalized refinement of r according to b \u2013 denoted by rPN(b) \u2013 consists in r without all disjuncts that have a strictly\nsmaller probability than rb. Remain the laws that were not applied in b. In line with the understanding of normality from HH, we choose to handle these such that they cannot have effects which result in a world less normal than the actual world. Thus we remove those disjuncts which have a probability lower than 0.5, and are inconsistent with the assignment in the leaf of b. Further, say the total probability of the removed disjuncts in some law is p, then we renormalize the remaining probabilities by dividing by 1\u2212 p (Unless p = 1, then we simply remove the law.)\nDefinition 3. Given a theory T , and a story b, we define the probabilistically normalized refinement of T according to b as T PN(b) := {rPN(b)|r \u2208 T}.\nIn case of our example, T PN(b) = T b, shown earlier. A second reading of normality considers not what did or could happen, but what ought to happen. To allow such considerations, we extend CP-logic theories with norms. Everything that can possibly happen is described by the CP-laws of a theory, hence we choose to introduce prescriptive norms as corrections to descriptive CP-laws. These corrections take the form of alternative probabilities for the disjuncts in the head of a law, which represent how the law should behave. (A more general approach could be imagined, but for the present purpose this extension will suffice.) These probabilities will be enclosed in curly braces, and have no influence on the actual behaviour of a theory. However, if we wish to look at how the world should behave, we can enforce the norms by replacing the original probabilities of a theory T with the normative ones. For example, extending law (1) with the norm that the professor shouldn\u2019t take pens, even though he often does, gives (Pro f : 0.7{p})\u2190, where 1\u226b p. The normatively normalized refinement is then given by the CP-law (Pro f : p) \u2190. To properly capture the HH definition, our normalized theory should allow all worlds that are at least as normal as b, including of course b itself. For this reason, we here restrict attention to norms with 0 < p < 1, because a norm p = 0 or p = 1 could make the actual world b impossible. (This restriction is lifted in our own proposal in Section 6.4).\nDefinition 4. Given an extended theory T , i.e., a theory also containing norms, we define the normatively normalized refinement of T as T NN := {rNN |r \u2208 T}, where rNN is the normatively normalized refinement of r.\nWe can combine both senses of normality, as follows:\nDefinition 5. Given an extended theory T , and a story b, we define the normal refinement of T according to b as T Normal(b) := (T NN)PN(b).\nThe normal refinement according to b is constructed out of T by eliminating all the disjuncts with values of variables that are less normal (either probabilistically or normatively) than the values from b, and thus it allows precisely those stories which are at least as normal as b.2 In case of our example, T Normal(b) is given by (Pro f : p) \u2190 and laws (5) and (6).\n2A formal proof of this can be found in the Appendices, as Lemma 1.\nRemains to be explained how we get from a given extended structural model to an extended CP-theory. The normality ranking is derived by considering what is typical for those variables depending directly on the exogenous variables, i.e., those that we represent by X : p \u2190. HH use statements that take the form: \u201cit is typical for the variable X to be true\u201d, or \u201cit is typical for it to be false\u201d. In CP-logic this becomes: p > 0.5, and p < 0.5 respectively. A statement of the form: \u201cit is more typical for X to be true than for Y to be true\u201d translates in an ordering on the respective probabilities. If the typicality statement is of the normative kind, then it is best represented by norms in CP-logic. Thus if there is a norm regarding X then the law will take the extended form X : p{q}\u2190.\nIn Def. 2, we have that a world is an acceptable witness only if it belongs to the set of worlds allowed by the definition of actual causation, and it is at least as normal as the actual world. Similarly, we need to limit the stories allowed by Def. 1 \u2013 which are described by T \u2217 \u2013 to those stories which are at least as normal as b. We would like to do this in exactly the same manner as we did for T , i.e., by looking at (T \u2217)Normal(b). Unfortunately we need to treat the unique law that contains C in its head \u2013 denoted by r(C) \u2013 somewhat special. That\u2019s because in Def. 1 the intervention do(\u00acC) makes this law deterministic with an empty head. As we want to take into account the (ab)normality of \u00acC, we work with the normal refinement instead. Hence we denote by T \u2217\u2217 the theory identical to T \u2217 except that it contains the normal refinement of r(C).\nDefinition 6. Given an extended theory T , a story b such that C and E hold in its leaf, and the theory T \u2217 as described in Section 2.2. We define the normal refinement of T \u2217 according to b and C as T Normal(b)\u2217 := (T \u2217\u2217)Normal(b).\nBesides the normality and belonging to T \u2217, recall that the remaining requirement for a story to be a witness, is that \u00acC and \u00acE hold in it. This leads us to the following formulation of the HH-approach in CP-logic.\nDefinition 7. [HH-CP-logic-extension of actual causation] Given an extended theory T , and a branch b such that both C and E hold in its leaf. We define that C is an HH-CP-logicactual cause of E in (T,b) iff PT Normal(b)\u2217(\u00acE \u2227\u00acC)> 0.\nFor C = Assistant, the probabilistic normalisation of T \u2217\u2217 replaces rC with the deterministic law Assistant \u2190, leading to P(\u00acNoPens\u2227 \u00acAssistant) = 0. On the other hand, for C = Pro f essor, the normative normalisation replaces rC with (Pro f : p) \u2190, leading to P(\u00acNoPens\u2227\u00acPro f ) = q. Thus Pro f is judged to be a strong cause of NoPens, whereas Assistant isn\u2019t a cause at all, in line with the empirical results from (Knobe and Fraser 2008). Note that it is only by using the normative probabilities rather than the statistical ones that we get the correct response for Pro f .\nWe now show that Def. 7 is indeed the correct translation of the HH approach from structural models to CP-logic.\nTheorem 1. C is an HH-actual cause of E in an extended model and context (M, ,u) iff C is an HH-CP-logic-actual cause of E in (T,b), where (T,b) is derived from (M, ,u) in the sense described above.\nProof. See Appendix."}, {"heading": "5 The Importance of Counterfactuals", "text": "We mentioned earlier that one criterion for a story to be normal was that it respects the laws/equations. On the other hand definitions of actual causation look at counterfactual stories resulting from an intervention, namely do(\u00acC), which violates the laws. Following HH, Def. 7 tries to circumvent the use of this intervention by simply demanding that \u00acC holds. However this solution is not always available, and when it isn\u2019t this provides counterintuitive results. We illustrate what goes wrong by using the following theory:\n(A : 0.1)\u2190 .\nC \u2190 A.\nE \u2190C.\nE \u2190\u00acA.\nConsider the story where first A occurs, followed by C and E . Intuitively, C is a strong cause of E , also when taking into account the typicality of C. The law with A in its head is intrinsic, and thus T Normal(b)\u2217 is:\nA \u2190 .\nC \u2190 A.\nE \u2190C.\nE \u2190\u00acA.\nApplying the definition, we get that PTNormal(b)\u2217(\u00acE \u2227\u00acC) = 0, giving the absurd result that C is not a cause of E at all. The problem lies in the fact that in its current form we only allow stories containing \u00acC in the usual, lawful way, rather than stories which contain \u00acC as a result of the intervention do(\u00acC). The problem remains if we use the HP-definition \u2013 as HH does \u2013 instead of our working definition.\nWe can set this straight by looking instead at PTNormal(b)\u2217(\u00acE|do(\u00acC)), so that we re-establish the counterfactual nature of our definition. (As T \u2217\u2217|do(\u00acC) = T \u2217|do(\u00acC), this is equivalent to P(T\u2217)Normal(b)(\u00acE|do(\u00acC)), which no longer mentions the artificial theory T \u2217\u2217.) However, by making this move we no longer take into account the (ab)normality of C itself, whereas research shows extensively that causal judgments regarding an event are often influenced by how normal it was (Kahneman 1986; Knobe and Fraser 2008; Hitchcock and Knobe 2009). (This effect is not limited to normative contexts. For example, the lighting of a match is usually judged a cause of a fire, whereas the presence of oxygen is considered so normal that it isn\u2019t.) Hence we should factor in this normality, which is expressed by PTNormal(b)(\u00acC)). As the following theorem shows, our new choice only makes a difference in a limited set of cases.\nTheorem 2. If r(C) is non-deterministic or PTNormal(b)(\u00acC) = 0, then PT Normal(b)\u2217(\u00acE \u2227 \u00acC) = P(T\u2217)Normal(b)(\u00acE|do(\u00acC))\u2217PTNormal(b)(\u00acC).\nProof. See Appendix.\nIf r(C) is deterministic and PTNormal(b)(\u00acC) > 0, as in the example shown, then contrary to the left-hand side of the equation, the proposed adjustment on the right-hand side of the equation gives the desired result 1 \u2217 0.9 = 0.9."}, {"heading": "6 The Importance of Probabilities", "text": "Because the HH-approach lacks the quantification of normality offered by probabilities, they dismiss entirely all witnesses that are less normal than the actual world.

By using probabilities, this qualitative criterion is no longer necessary: less normal witnesses simply influence our causal judgment less.

If a 10-sided die lands 1, you win a car. If not, you get a 100 more throws. If all of them land higher than 1, then you also win the car. The first throw lands 1, and you win the car.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine anyone objecting to the judgment that the first throw is a cause of you winning the car. Yet that is exactly what we get when applying the current definition. The following theory T describes the set-up of the contest, where T hrow(i, j) means that the i-th throw landed j or smaller.\n(T hrow(1,1) : 0.1)\u2190 .\n(T hrow(2,1) : 0.1)\u2190\u00acT hrow(1,1).\n(T hrow(3,1) : 0.1)\u2190\u00acT hrow(1,1)\u2227\u00acThrow(2,1).\n...\nWinCar \u2190 Throw(1,1).\nWinCar \u2190\u00acT hrow(2,1)\u2227 ...\u2227\u00acThrow(100,1).\nThe normal refinement of T according to the story is given by:\n(T hrow(1,1) : 0.1)\u2190 .\nWinCar \u2190 Throw(1,1).\nWinCar \u2190\u00acT hrow(2,1)\u2227 ...\u2227\u00acThrow(100,1).\nWe get that P(T\u2217)Normal(b)(\u00acWinCar|do(\u00acThrows(1,1))) = 0, and thus Throws(1,1) is not a cause of WinCar. In terms of HH: although \u00acT hrow(1,1)\u2227\u00acThrow(2,1)\u2227 ...\u2227 \u00acT hrow(100,1)\u2227WinCar, is very unlikely, it is the only candidate witness. To see why, recall that a witness needs to have \u00acT hrows(1,1), and should be at least as normal as the actual world. In every other world with \u00acT hrows(1,1), at least one of the T hrows(i,1) is true, and hence it is less normal. But in a witness it should hold that \u00acWinCar, so there is no witness for T hrows(1,1) being a cause of WinCar.\nOn the other hand the theory (T \u2217)NN in this case is simply equal to T , but for the first law being T hrow(1,1) \u2190. Hence the probability of not winning the car given that the first throw does not land 1 is pretty much 1, and the value in the equation becomes approximately 0.9, indicating T hrow(1,1) to be a very strong cause of WinCar.\n6.2 Why we should look at all witnesses The current example also illustrates why it makes sense to aggregate the strength of all witnesses: the best witness for T hrow(1,1) is the story in which \u00acT hrow(1,1)\u2227 Throw(2,1)\u2227\u00acT hrow(3,1)\u2227 ...\u2227\u00acT hrow(100,1), with a probability of 0.09, thus making T hrow(1,1) a very minor cause of WinCar under the HH-approach. Put informally, the alternative we should be considering is not one particular outcome \u2013 the best witness \u2013 of the throwing sequence that makes you lose the car, but the set of all such sequences \u2013 all witnesses \u2013 taken together."}, {"heading": "6.3 Why it is better to use T NN in the second factor", "text": "Imagine the same story, with a slight variation to the rules of the contest: you win the car on the first throw if the die lands anything under 7. Hence the first head changes to T hrow(1,6) : 0.6, making it a typical outcome. Therefore the first law becomes deterministic in T PN(b), giving that PTNormal(b)(\u00acT hrow(1,6)) = 0, which again results in the counterintuitive judgment that the first throw in no way caused you to win the car.\nWe therefore suggest to use T NN in the second factor of the inequality rather than T Normal(b), making use of the gradual measurement offered by probabilities. Applying this idea to the example, we get the result that T hrow(1,6) has causal strength 0.4.

We can then define that C actually causes E in (M,u) if and only if there exists some witness w \u2208WM,u(C,E) for which w |= \u00acC\u2227\u00acE . Assume also that we have a corresponding definition in the context of CP-logic: for a CP-logic theory T and branch b, we have defined the set of counterfactual branches BT,b(C,E), and say that C actually caused E in b if and only if there exists a witness b\u2032 \u2208 BT,b(C,E) such that Lea f \u2032b |= \u00acC \u2227\u00acE . Moreover, assume that these two notions are equivalent, i.e., that w \u2208 WM,u(C,E) if and only if there exists a branch b \u2208 BT,b(C,E) such that Lea fb = w.\nTo facilitate the proof of Theorem 1, we introduce the following lemma.\nLemma 1. Given an extended model and context (M, ,u), and a theory and branch (T,b) that are derived from (M, ,u) in the sense described earlier. Then for any world w, and a branch d of a probability tree from T that corresponds to it, it holds that w su iff d occurs in a probability tree of T Normal(b).\nProof. We know that b is a branch in a probability tree from T such that Lea fb has the same assignment as su. Recall that T consists of two categories of laws. First there are those corresponding to the equations for the endogenous variables which depend on other endogenous variables, which are deterministic and thus re-appear in T Normal(b) unchanged. Second there are those corresponding to the endogenous variables which directly depend on the exogenous variables, which take the form X : p{q} \u2190, where the second probability need not be present.\nAssume we have a world w such that w su. Any world that satisfies the equations of M follows deterministically from a context, i.e., an assignment to all exogenous variables. As su is a world that satisfies the equations, and w is at least as normal, it also satisfies the equations. Hence there is a context u\u2032 which determines w. In CP-logic, such a context corresponds to choosing particular disjuncts in the heads of all laws from the second category.\nConcretely, this means that for each law/equation of the second category, the value of the corresponding variable X is at least as typical in w = s\u2032u as it is in su. Denote by Xw and Xs the values X takes in the worlds w and su respectively. By construction of T Normal(b), the disjuncts which are at least typical as Xs \u2013 be it in the statistical or in the normative sense \u2013 still appear in the law for X in T Normal(b), and hence can be chosen when this law is applied. Therefore the branches corresponding to w from the probability trees of T also appear in the probability trees of T Normal(b), be it that the values of the probabilities may have changed.\nNow assume we have a branch d corresponding to a world w, that occurs in a probability tree of T Normal(b). We can simply reverse the correspondence between the choices of disjuncts and a context, to obtain that w su.\nTheorem 1. C is an HH-actual cause of E in an extended model and context (M, ,u) iff C is an HH-CP-logic-actual cause of E in (T,b), where (T,b) is derived from (M, ,u) in the sense described in Section 4.\nProof. We begin with the implication from left to right. So assume we have an extended model and context (M, ,u), such that C and E hold in su, and there is at least one witness w of C being an actual cause of E in (M,u) such that w su.\nBy the assumptions made above, we get that C is an actual cause of E in (T,b), and more specifically that any branch d that corresponds to w is a witness of this. Thus d appears in a probability tree of T \u2217|do(\u00acC).\nBy Lemma 1, we know that such a branch d also appears in a probability tree of T Normal(b).\nWe look separately at the two options regarding r(C). First we assume that r(C) is non-deterministic. Since d occurs in a tree of T Normal(b), and \u00acC holds in it, the empty disjunct remains present in the normal refinement of r(C). By definition, T \u2217\u2217 is simply T \u2217 with the normal refinement of r(C). Therefore d also occurs in a tree of T \u2217\u2217.\nSecond, assume r(C) is deterministic. Then T \u2217\u2217 = T \u2217. Since d occurs in a tree of T Normal(b), which obviously contains C in the head of r(C), the body for r(C) cannot be satisfied in d. Thus the intervention do(\u00acC) is irrelevant to d, and again we can conclude that d also occurs in a tree of T \u2217\u2217.\nSo in all cases we have that d occurs both in a tree of T Normal(b), and in a tree of T \u2217\u2217. This implies that the disjuncts chosen in the laws applied in d occur in the versions these laws take in both of these theories, with possibly different but strictly positive probabilities. Note that every law from T Normal(b)\u2217 either takes the form it has in T \u2217\u2217 or it takes the form it has in T Normal(b). Therefore d also appears in T Normal(b)\u2217. It being a witness, \u00acC and \u00acE hold in it, and thus the stated probability is strictly positive.\nNow we continue with the reverse implication. Assume we have an extended theory T , a story b such that C and E hold in it, and PTNormal(b)\u2217(\u00acE \u2227\u00acC) > 0. This implies the existence of a branch d in T Normal(b)\u2217 such that both \u00acC and \u00acE holds.\nSay r is a law from T Normal(b)\u2217. If r is intrinsic and not r(C), it is deterministic, containing the single (possibly empty) disjunct rd with associated probability 1. As rd was the actual choice from b, by construction rd also appears in the normal refinement of r, although the probability may be different. However, as long as we do not have strict norms, i.e., norms where p or q is 1, this probability will be strictly positive. A strict norm means that a violation of it is considered entirely abnormal, analogous to the occurrence of an event with zero probability. Since HH treat norms identical to statistical normality, and since the actual world was\npossible, it follows that the actual world is not entirely abnormal. Hence even if rd was a violation of a norm, it will not have been a strict norm. (Our final definition from Section 5.5 does allow for strict norms.) Thus, we conclude that rd occurs in the head of the versions of the law r we find in both T \u2217 and T Normal(b). Because r is not r(C), we can say the same about T \u2217|do(\u00acC).\nIf r is not intrinsic and not r(C), it contains all of its original disjuncts when it occurs in T \u2217. Therefore it takes the same form in T Normal(b)\u2217 as it does in T Normal(b). Again we conclude that rd occurs in the head of the versions of the law r we find in each of T \u2217, T Normal(b) and T \u2217|do(\u00acC).\nThis leaves us to consider r(C). By definition, T Normal(b)\u2217 contains the same version as T Normal(b). From this and the previous paragraphs we can already conclude that any branch occuring in a tree of T Normal(b)\u2217 also occurs in a tree of T Normal(b). More specifically this holds for d. Thus by Lemma 1, it holds for the corresponding world w that w su.\nIf the body for r(C) is false in d, then the precise form of the head of r(C) is irrelevant for d. As the head of r(C) is the only difference between T \u2217\u2217 and T \u2217|do(\u00acC), we can again conclude that d also occurs in T \u2217|do(\u00acC).\nLeaves us to consider the case that the body for r(C) is true in d. From the fact that d \u2013 in which \u00acC holds \u2013 occurs in T Normal(b), we can infer that r(C) is a non-deterministic law. Taken together with the knowledge that the disjunct containing C was chosen in b, it follows that the normal refinement of r(C) contains both C and the empty disjunct in its head. Furthermore, in d the empty disjunct was chosen. These observations taken together imply that the disjunct of r(C) chosen in d occurs in the head of the versions of r(C) we find in both T \u2217\u2217 and T \u2217|do(\u00acC). Once more we conclude that d also occurs in T \u2217|do(\u00acC).\nThus d is a witness for C being an actual cause of E in (T,b). Therefore the world w corresponding to d is a witness for C being an actual cause of E in (M,u). Together with the fact that w su, the conclusion follows.\nTheorem 2. If r(C) is non-deterministic or PTNormal(b)(\u00acC) = 0, then PTNormal(b)\u2217(\u00acE \u2227 \u00acC) = P(T\u2217)Normal(b)(\u00acE|do(\u00acC))\u2217PTNormal(b)(\u00acC).\nProof. First we examine the case where PT Normal(b)(\u00acC) = 0. This implies that the right-hand side of the equation is 0. Also, any branch from a tree T Normal(b)\u2217 occurs as well in a tree of T Normal(b), so PTNormal(b)\u2217(\u00acC) = 0 and the left-hand side is also equal to 0.\nThis leaves us to consider the case where PTNormal(b)(\u00acC)> 0 and r(C) is non-deterministic.\nIn this case PT Normal(b)\u2217(\u00acC) = PTNormal(b)(\u00acC), so we have: PTNormal(b)\u2217(\u00acE \u2227 \u00acC) = PTNormal(b)\u2217(\u00acE \u2227 \u00acC) \u2217 PTNormal(b)(\u00acC)/PT Normal(b)\u2217(\u00acC) = PT Normal(b)\u2217(\u00acE|\u00acC) \u2217 PTNormal(b)(\u00acC).\nFurther, conditioning on \u00acC when C only occurs in a vacuous non-deterministic law, is identical to looking at the intervention do(\u00acC), thus the list of equalities continues:\n= PTNormal(b)\u2217(\u00acE|do(\u00acC)) \u2217 PTNormal(b)(\u00acC). Also, T Normal(b)\u2217|do(\u00acC) = (T \u2217)Normal(b)\u2217|do(\u00acC), which brings us to the desired conclusion."}], "references": [{"title": "Counterfactual dependency and actual causation in cp-logic and structural models: a comparison", "author": ["S.
