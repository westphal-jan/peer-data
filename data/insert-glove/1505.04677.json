The graded attribute implications are more general formulas than the classic attribute implications in that they allow to express attribute dependencies to degrees. For instance, a rule\n{0.9/good neighborhood , 1/large} \u21d2 {0.98/expensive} (1)\nsaying that if an object (e.g., a house for sale) is located in a good neighborhood and is large, then it is expensive, may be seen as a typical example of a graded attribute implication. In this example, the values 0.9, 1, and 0.98 (taken from the real unit interval) express lower bounds (or thresholds) of truth degrees to which we consider the attributes valid in data. Therefore, a finer reading of the rule is: \u201cif a house is located in a good neighborhood at least to degree 0.9 and is large at least to degree 1, then it is expensive at least to degree 0.98\u201d. In formal concept analysis (FCA) of graded object-attribute data and in particular in the approach to FCA with linguistic hedges [17], graded attribute implications play an analogous role as the classic attribute implications in the ordinary FCA.\nIn FCA, one typically wants to find a small representative set of attribute implications which conveys the information about all attribute implications which hold is a given formal context. Equivalently, one wishes to find a small set of attribute implications whose models are exactly all concept intents of the data. Guigues-Duquenne bases [34] which are determined by pseudo-intents of formal concepts are examples of such sets which are in addition minimal in terms of the number of contained formulas, cf. also [29]. In FCA with graded attributes, a general notion of a system of pseudo-intents has been proposed and studied, see [18] for a survey. Unlike the classic case, general systems of pseudo-intents are not unique and may not ensure minimality of the corresponding base. Also, such systems may not exist when the structure of degrees is infinite and their existence for general finite scales is an open problem. From the computational point of view, graph-theoretic methods for obtaining general systems of pseudointents are proposed but they are limited only to small data sets. Therefore, further investigation is needed and this paper makes a contribution to this area.\nIn this paper, we show that bases of graded attribute implications given by general systems of pseudo-intents correspond to non-redundant sets of graded attribute implications with saturated consequents where the non-redundancy of each formula in the set is witnessed by its own antecedent. Both the notions of saturation and witnessed non-redundancy are introduced in Section 4. Furthermore, we introduce a constructive method for transformation of any set of graded attribute implications (which is complete in a given data) to a non-redundant base with witnessed non-redundancy from which a system of pseudo-intents can be derived. In practice, this means that we can avoid the graph-based method and compute systems of pseudo-intents by an alternative and much faster approach. We prove that the proposed procedure works if we consider globalization [51] as a parameter of the interpretation of graded attribute implications. For linguistic hedges [17, 26, 37] other than the globalization, which serve as parameters of the interpretation of graded attribute implications, the procedure may not produce the desired base but as our experimental observations show, it seems to have a high success rate.\nThe results contained in our paper fall in the category of results on bases of if-then rules generated from data [3, 19, 43] which develop ideas of the seminal paper [34]. Although we work with graded if-then rules with semantics defined using complete residuated lattices as structures of degrees and parameterized by linguistic hedges, our approach is general and we anticipate it can be adopted in recently developed approaches such as [40, 45].\nOur paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the basic notions of residuated structures of truth degrees and graded attribute implications. In Section 3, we present a background and a survey of existing results on nonredundant bases of graded attribute implications and give further motivation for our work. Section 4 contains the new results. Finally, Section 5 shows experimental observations on efficiency on computing sets of graded attribute implications with witnessed non-redundancy and presents open problems."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In this section, we present the basic notions of structures of truth degrees and graded attribute implications. Whenever possible, we keep the same notation as in [4] for general residuated structures and [18] for graded attribute implications.\nWe utilize complete residuated lattices as structures of truth degrees. For our development, these structures represent a reasonable generalization of the most common structures of degrees defined on the real unit interval using leftcontinuous triangular norms [25, 38]. Recall that a complete residuated lattice [4, 28] is an algebra L = \u3008L,\u2227,\u2228,\u2297,\u2192, 0, 1\u3009 where \u3008L,\u2227,\u2228, 0, 1\u3009 is a complete lattice (i.e., a lattice where infima and suprema exist for arbitrary subsets of L), \u3008L,\u2297, 1\u3009 is a commutative monoid (i.e., \u2297 is commutative, associative, and 1 is neutral with respect to \u2297), and \u2297 and \u2192 satisfy the so-called adjointness property: for all a, b, c \u2208 L, we have that a \u2297 b \u2264 c iff a \u2264 b \u2192 c, where \u2264 is the (complete lattice) order induced by L (i.e., a \u2264 b iff a = a \u2227 b iff a \u2228 b = b iff a \u2192 b = 1). We interpret \u2297 and \u2192 as it is usual in mathematical fuzzy logics [20, 32, 33, 36] and their applications [39]: \u2297 is a truth function of \u201cfuzzy conjunction\u201d and \u2192 is a truth function of \u201cfuzzy implication\u201d, cf. also [21, 22] for surveys of results on fuzzy logics in the narrow sense.\nIn the paper, we use illustrative examples based on finite (and thus complete) residuated lattices defined on equidistant subchains of the real unit interval. That is, we consider L = {\n0, 1n , 2 n , . . . , 1\n}\nfor some natural n and use the\nnatural ordering of rational numbers, i.e., \u2227 and \u2228 coincide with the operations of minimum and maximum, respectively. If \u2297 coincides with \u2227, we call the resulting L a finite Go\u0308del chain in which case we have a \u2192 b = 1 iff a \u2264 b and a \u2192 b = b otherwise. If \u2297 and \u2192 are given by\ni n \u2297 j n = max\n{\n0, in + j n \u2212 1\n}\n, (2)\ni n \u2192 j n = min\n{\n1, 1\u2212 in + j n\n}\n, (3)\nwe call the resulting L a finite Lukasiewicz chain. More general finite residuated lattices on equidistant subchains of the real unit interval may be considered but\nin our examples we utilize only these two basic structures, cf. [23, 38].\nIn addition to \u2297 and \u2192 which may be seen as generalizations of truth function of the classic logical connectives \u201cconjunction\u201d and \u201cimplication\u201d, we make use of linguistic hedges [55, 56, 57, 58] which do not have nontrivial counterparts in classic logics. In particular, we utilize idempotent truth-stressing (i.e., truth intensifying) linguistic hedges (shortly, hedges), which are considered as maps \u2217 : L \u2192 L such that 1\u2217 = 1, a\u2217 \u2264 a, (a \u2192 b)\u2217 \u2264 a\u2217 \u2192 b\u2217, and a\u2217 \u2264 a\u2217\u2217 for all a, b \u2208 L. Using similar arguments as in [37], such maps may be seen as truth functions of logical connectives \u201cvery true\u201d, cf. also [26] and [22] for recent results on hedges. Two basic hedges can be introduced on any complete residuated lattice. Namely, (i) the identity (i.e., a\u2217 = a for all a \u2208 L), and (ii) the so-called globalization [51]:\na\u2217 =\n \n\n1, if a = 1, 0, otherwise, (4)\nfor all a \u2208 L. Note that on linear residuated lattices, the globalization coincides with the truth function of the Baaz \u2206 connective [2].\nFor a fixed complete residuated lattice L and a non-empty universe set Y , an L-set A in Y (or an L-fuzzy set [31]) is any map A : Y \u2192 L. As usual, A(y) is interpreted as the degree to which y belongs to A. The collection of all L-sets in Y is denoted by LY . In a similar fashion, we introduce binary L-relations: for non-empty universe sets X and Y , a (binary) L-relation between X and Y (or an L-fuzzy relation between X and Y ) is any map R : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 L with R(x, y) understood as the degree to which x and y are R-related (or related by R). It is convenient to treat binary L-relations between X and Y as L-set in X\u00d7Y . We write L-sets and L-relation on finite universes in the usual way, i.e., {a1/y1, . . . , an/yn} denotes an L-set A in Y = {y1, . . . , yn} such that A(yi) = ai for all i = 1, . . . , n. Optionally, we omit ai/yi whenever ai = 0 and write just yi instead of ai/yi whenever ai = 1. In particular, {} denotes the empty L-set in Y , i.e., {}(y) = 0 for all y \u2208 Y . The basic operations with L-sets are defined componentwise using operations in L. For instance, if A and B are L-sets in\nY , then A\u2229B denotes the L-set in Y (called the intersection of A and B) such that (A \u2229B)(y) = A(y) \u2227B(y) for each y \u2208 Y and analogously for \u222a and \u2228.\nWe utilize the notion of a graded subsethood [31, 32] (graded inclusion) which generalizes the ordinary set inclusion. For any A,B \u2208 LY , we define a degree S(A,B) of subsethood of A in B by\nS(A,B) = \u2227\ny\u2208Y\n( A(y) \u2192 B(y) ) . (5)\nClearly, S(A,B) is a general degree in L. If S(A,B) = 1, we denote the fact by A \u2286 B and say that A is (fully) included in B. Notice that in this case, we have A(y) \u2264 B(y) for all y \u2208 Y (this is owing to the fact that a \u2192 b = 1 iff a \u2264 b).\nNow, graded attribute implications and their interpretation [18] may be introduced as follows. Let Y be a finite non-empty set of (symbolic names of) attributes. A graded attribute implication in Y is an expression A \u21d2 B where A,B \u2208 LY ; A is called the antecedent of A \u21d2 B, B is called the consequent of A \u21d2 B. Alternatively, graded attribute implications are called fuzzy attribute implication [10] and for brevity we refer to the formulas as FAIs. For A,B,M \u2208 LY , we define the degree ||A \u21d2 B||M to which A \u21d2 B is true in M by\n||A \u21d2 B||M = S(A,M) \u2217 \u2192 S(B,M). (6)\nRecall that in (6), S stands for graded subsethood (5), and \u2217 is a hedge on L. Furthermore, if M \u2286 LY , then we put\n||A \u21d2 B||M = \u2227 M\u2208M ||A \u21d2 B||M (7)\nand call ||A \u21d2 B||M the degree to which A \u21d2 B is true in M.\nRemark 1. According to its definition, the degree to which A \u21d2 B is true in M depends not only on the operations in L (namely, \u2227 and \u2192) but also on the hedge \u2217. The hedge in (6) may be seen as a parameter of the interpretation of A \u21d2 B in M and will play an important role in our paper, see also [18] for detailed comments on the role of hedges. Also note that if M is regarded as an L-set of attributes of an object (i.e., M(y) is a degree to which an object\nhas the attribute y), then ||A \u21d2 B||M is a degree to which it is true that \u201cIf the object has all the attributes from A, then it has all the attributes from B\u201d. This naturally generalizes the ordinary attribute implications and their semantics, see [30].\nConsider fixed Y and let \u03a3 be a set of FAIs. An L-set M \u2208 LY is called a model of \u03a3 whenever ||A \u21d2 B||M = 1 for all A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u03a3. The set of all models of \u03a3 is denoted by Mod(\u03a3). The degree ||A \u21d2 B||\u03a3 to which A \u21d2 B is semantically entailed by \u03a3 is defined by\n||A \u21d2 B||\u03a3 = \u2227 M\u2208Mod(\u03a3) ||A \u21d2 B||M . (8)\nTherefore, the degree to which a FAI (semantically) follows from \u03a3 is defined as the infimum of all degrees to which it is true in all models of \u03a3. This is consistent with the abstract logic framework proposed by Pavelka [46, 47, 48] which was inspired by the influential paper [32] by Goguen. Note that since Mod(\u03a3) \u2286 LY , we may write ||A \u21d2 B||\u03a3 = ||A \u21d2 B||Mod(\u03a3) on account of (7).\nIn our paper, we exploit a characterization of the semantic entailment which is based on least models. The system Mod(\u03a3) of all models of any \u03a3 is known to form a particular closure system (called an L\u2217-closure system [7]), see [16]. Therefore, we may introduce the least model [M ]\u03a3 of \u03a3 which contains M :\n[M ]\u03a3 = \u22c2 {N \u2208 Mod(\u03a3); M \u2286 N}. (9)\nThe following proposition establishes a characterization of the semantic entailment by least models and graded subsethood, see [18, Theorem 3.11].\nProposition 1. For any \u03a3 and A,B \u2208 LY: ||A \u21d2 B||\u03a3 = S(B, [A]\u03a3).\nIn particular, Proposition 1 yields that ||A \u21d2 B||\u03a3 = 1 iff S(B, [A]\u03a3) = 1 which is true iff B is fully contained in [A]\u03a3, i.e., B \u2286 [A]\u03a3. As a further consequence, for given A, [A]\u03a3 is the greatest L-set among all B \u2208 LY such that ||A \u21d2 B||\u03a3 = 1.\nLet \u03a3 and \u0393 be sets of FAIs in Y . We call \u03a3 and \u0393 equivalent whenever ||A \u21d2 B||\u03a3 = ||A \u21d2 B||\u0393 for all A,B \u2208 LY . In words, \u03a3 and \u0393 are equivalent\nwhenever they entail each FAI to the same degree. The following proposition shows that the condition can be restated in several equivalent ways, see [10, 18].\nProposition 2. For any \u03a3 and \u0393, the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) \u03a3 and \u0393 are equivalent,\n(ii) for all A,B \u2208 LY : ||A \u21d2 B||\u03a3 = 1 iff ||A \u21d2 B||\u0393 = 1,\n(iii) for all A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u03a3: ||A \u21d2 B||\u0393 = 1 and\nfor all C \u21d2 D \u2208 \u0393: ||C \u21d2 D||\u03a3 = 1,\n(iv) Mod(\u03a3) = Mod(\u0393).\nWe conclude the preliminaries by the following remark on alternative seman-\ntics and axiomatizations of the semantic entailment of FAIs.\nRemark 2. (a) The notion of a degree of semantic entailment used in this paper is defined in a way which generalizes the classic propositional semantics of attribute implications. That is, for M \u2208 Mod(\u03a3), the degree M(y) is interpreted as the degree to which y is present in M . Thus, if attributes are considered as propositional variables, M may be seen as their evaluation prescribing degrees to which the propositional variables are true. Since the classic attribute implications have an alternative database semantics [24, 27, 50] which yields the same notion of semantic entailment, it may be tempting to look for an analogous alternative semantics in the graded setting. In [12], it is shown that such an alternative semantics exists and that FAIs may alternatively be seen as formulas prescribing similarity-based dependencies in relational databases [44].\n(b) The semantic entailment introduced in this paper has (several) interesting Armstrong-style [1] axiomatizations. An inference system which is complete over arbitrary L is presented in [13]. Note that the inference system presented therein contains an infinitary rule which may be disregarded in some important cases [18, 54], cf. also [41] for an alternative axiomatization with an infinitary rule. An alternative inference systems based on the rules of simplification in presented in [6]. A graph-based inference system for FAIs is presented in [52]."}, {"heading": "3 Non-Redundant Bases: Overview and Related Work", "text": "In this section, we present an overview of existing results regarding bases of FAIs. The existing approaches are concerned with describing bases of objectattribute data with graded attributes which are formalized as formal L-contexts: For non-empty finite sets X (set of objects) and Y (set of attributes), and a binary L-relation I : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 L, the triplet I = \u3008X,Y, I\u3009 is called a formal L-context [4]. A formal L-context I induces a couple of operators \u2191 : LX \u2192 LY and \u2193 : LY \u2192 LX defined by\nA\u2191(y) = \u2227\nx\u2208X\n( A(x)\u2217 \u2192 I(x, y) ) , (10)\nB\u2193(x) = \u2227\ny\u2208Y\n( B(y) \u2192 I(x, y) ) , (11)\nfor all A \u2208 LX , B \u2208 LY , x \u2208 X , and y \u2208 Y . The operators \u2193, \u2191 form a so-called Galois connection with hedge [17] and their composition \u2193\u2191 is an L\u2217-closure operator [7]. Given I = \u3008X,Y, I\u3009, which represents input data, we define the degree ||A \u21d2 B||I to which A \u21d2 B (A,B \u2208 L Y ) is true in I, see [5], as follows:\n||A \u21d2 B||I = \u2227 x\u2208X ||A \u21d2 B||{1/x}\u2191 . (12)\nHence, ||A \u21d2 B||I may be understood as a generalization of the ordinary notion of an attribute implication valid in a formal context: ||A \u21d2 B||I is the degree to which the following condition is true: \u201cFor each object x \u2208 X , if the object has all the attributes from A, then it has all the attributes from B\u201d.\nNow, the basic problem regarding FAIs and formal L-contexts is the follow-\ning: Given I = \u3008X,Y, I\u3009, find \u03a3 such that\n||A \u21d2 B||\u03a3 = ||A \u21d2 B||I (13)\nfor all A,B \u2208 LY . Such a \u03a3 is called complete in I. In addition, if \u03a3 is nonredundant (or minimal), then it is called a non-redundant (or minimal) base of I. The notion of non-redundancy is considered the usual way: A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u03a3 is redundant in \u03a3 whenever ||A \u21d2 B||\u03a3\\{A\u21d2B} = 1; \u03a3 is non-redundant whenever there is no A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u03a3 which is redundant in \u03a3. Analogously, \u03a3 being minimal means that there is no \u0393 which is equivalent to \u03a3 such that |\u0393| < |\u03a3|.\nThe investigation of complete sets and bases in the graded setting started with [49] where the author generalizes the ordinary notion of a pseudo-intent [34], see also [29, 30]. In this setting, the hedges were not involved as parameters of the semantics of FAIs as in (6) which may be viewed in our general setting so that \u2217 is taken as the identity. In [49], P \u2208 LY is called a pseudo-intent (of I) whenever P 6= P \u2193\u2191 (i.e., P \u2282 P \u2193\u2191) and\nfor each pseudo-intent Q \u2282 P , we have Q\u2193\u2191 \u2286 P. (14)\nTherefore, the definition of the notion of a pseudo-intent copies the classic definition except for \u2193\u2191 is given by (10) and (11). If L is finite, pseudo-intents exist and are uniquely given (recall that in our paper, we consider Y always finite). Furthermore, [49] observes that\n\u03a3 = {P \u21d2 P \u2193\u2191; P is a pseudo-intent} (15)\nis complete in I but in general, \u03a3 is redundant. Clearly, for L being the twoelement Boolean algebra, the notion of a pseudo-intent coincides with the classic one [34].\nIn [5], the authors propose a different notion of pseudo-intents in the graded setting. Namely, the approach in [5] started with using general hedges as parameters of the interpretation of FAIs in formal L-contexts (similar approach to parameterizations of if-then rules appeared in [14, 15]). In addition to that, the paper introduces a general concept of a system of pseudo-intents: Put\nU = {P \u2208 LY ; P 6= P \u2193\u2191} (16)\nand call P \u2286 U a system of pseudo-intents whenever for each P \u2208 U , we have\nP \u2208 P iff ||Q \u21d2 Q\u2193\u2191||P = 1 for any Q \u2208 P such that Q 6= P. (17)\nThe results in [5, 9] show that if \u2217 is globalization, then provided that L is finite, I admits a unique system of pseudo-intents which determines a minimal base\n\u03a3 = {P \u21d2 P \u2193\u2191; P \u2208 P} (18)\nof I analogously as in the classic case. In fact, for \u2217 being the globalization, (17) translates into (14). In [53], a criterion for minimality of a general set of FAIs for \u2217 being the globalization is described.\nThe analysis in [9] further showed that for general hedges, the systems of pseudo-intents are not given uniquely and may have different sizes and, in case of infinite L, may not even exist, cf. [18, Example 5.13]. On the other hand, if there is a system P of pseudo-intents of I, then (18) always determines a non-redundant base.\nIn order to compute general systems of pseudo-intents considering general hedges, a graph-based method has been announced in [8] and further described in [11]. The method is based on an observation that systems of pseudo-intents coincide with particular maximal independent sets in graphs induced by I. Namely, we can introduce\nE = {\u3008P,Q\u3009\u2208 U \u00d7 U ; P 6= Q and ||Q \u21d2 Q\u2193\u2191||P 6= 1} (19)\nIf U (defined as before) is non-empty, then G = \u3008U , E \u222a E\u22121\u3009 is a graph. Furthermore, for any P \u2286 U , [11] defines the following subsets of U :\nPred(P) = \u22c3\nQ\u2208P{P \u2208 U ; \u3008P,Q\u3009 \u2208 E}. (20)\nThe main observations of [11] which allow to determine systems of pseudointents as particular maximal independent sets are the following:\n(i) P is a system of pseudo-intents iff U \\ P = Pred(P);\n(ii) If U \\ P = Pred(P), then P is a maximal independent set in G.\nThe implications of [11] are more or less just theoretical because in practice one is unable to use such a graph-based procedure to find a system of pseudo-intents\u2014 because of the enormous size of G, enumerating of all maximal independent sets satisfying the additional condition (i) is intractable. Furthermore, the description does not answer the question if for any finite L and arbitrary hedge \u2217 there exists at least one system of pseudo-intents. This remains an open problem [42]."}, {"heading": "4 Results", "text": "The first observation we present in this section involves sets of FAIs in a special form. From the model-theoretic point of view, we show that for each set of FAIs, one can find an equivalent set where the consequents of all the FAIs contained in the set are models. This property is introduced in the following definition.\nDefinition 3. Let \u03a3 be a set of FAIs. We say that the FAIs in \u03a3 have saturated consequents whenever for every A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u03a3, we have [A]\u03a3 \u2286 B.\nObviously, whether a given A \u21d2 B has a saturated consequent depends on \u03a3 from which it is taken. Applying Proposition 1, it follows that FAIs in \u03a3 have saturated consequents iff for every A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u03a3, we have B = [A]\u03a3. Therefore, if FAIs in \u03a3 have saturated consequents, then all FAIs in \u03a3 are of the form A \u21d2 [A]\u03a3. The following assertion shows that each set of FAIs admits an equivalent set of FAIs with saturated consequents.\nLemma 4. Let \u0393 be a set of FAIs and let\n\u03a3 = {A \u21d2 [A]\u0393; A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u0393}. (21)\nThen, \u03a3 and \u0393 are equivalent. In addition, if \u0393 is minimal then so is \u03a3.\nProof. In order to prove the first part of the claim, according to Proposition 2 it suffices to check that \u0393 and \u03a3 given by (21) have the same models. This can be checked using Proposition 1 as follows.\nLet M \u2208 Mod(\u0393). In order to prove that M \u2208 Mod(\u03a3), it suffices to prove ||A \u21d2 [A]\u0393||M = 1 for each A \u21d2 [A]\u0393 \u2208 \u03a3 which is indeed true: Using Proposition 1, we get ||A \u21d2 [A]\u0393||\u0393 = 1 on the account of [A]\u0393 \u2286 [A]\u0393. Since M \u2208 Mod(\u0393), we therefore have ||A \u21d2 [A]\u0393||M = 1.\nConversely, let M \u2208 Mod(\u03a3) and take any A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u0393. Observe that ||A \u21d2 B||\u0393 = 1 and thus B \u2286 [A]\u0393 owing to Proposition 1. Since A \u21d2 [A]\u0393 \u2208 \u03a3, it follows that S(A,M)\u2217 \u2264 S([A]\u0393,M) which further gives\nS(A,M)\u2217 \u2264 S([A]\u0393,M) \u2264 S(B,M)\nbecause B \u2286 [A]\u0393 and the graded subsethood is antitone in the first argument, i.e., S(B1,M) \u2264 S(B2,M) whenever B2 \u2286 B1. Hence, S(A,M)\u2217 \u2264 S(B,M) gives ||A \u21d2 B||M = 1.\nThe second claim is an easy consequence of the first one: Suppose that \u0393 is minimal. Since \u03a3 and \u0393 are equivalent, we then have |\u0393| \u2264 |\u03a3|. Directly from (21), it follows that |\u03a3| \u2264 |\u0393| and thus |\u0393| = |\u03a3| which shows that \u03a3 is minimal as well.\nSince \u0393 and \u03a3 given by (21) are equivalent, it is easy to see that each FAI in \u03a3 is of the form A \u21d2 [A]\u03a3, i.e., the consequents on FAIs in \u03a3 are saturated. Also note that if the FAIs in \u0393 already have saturated consequents, then \u03a3 = \u0393 for \u03a3 given by (21).\nExample 1. (a) Let us note that \u03a3 given by (21) may be strictly smaller than \u0393 in terms of the number of formulas. This is true even in the case when L is the two-element Boolean algebra. Indeed, for \u0393 given by\n\u0393 = {{p} \u21d2 {q}, {p} \u21d2 {r}},\nwe obviously have [{p}]\u0393 = {q, r} and thus the corresponding \u03a3 given by (21) is of the form\n\u03a3 = {{p} \u21d2 {q, r}}.\n(b) Notice that in the previous case, both \u03a3 and \u0393 are non-redundant. In general, given a non-redundant \u0393, it may happen that the corresponding \u03a3 given by (21) is redundant. For instance, consider \u0393 as follows:\n\u0393 = {{} \u21d2 {p}, {p} \u21d2 {q}}.\nSince [{}]\u0393 = [{p}]\u0393 = {p, q}, \u03a3 given by (21) is of the form\n\u03a3 = {{} \u21d2 {p, q}, {p} \u21d2 {p, q}}.\nNow, observe that \u0393 is non-redundant while \u03a3 is redundant because {p} \u21d2 {p, q} is redundant in \u03a3. Therefore, unlike in the case of minimality, see Lemma 4, nonredundancy is not preserved by saturating the consequents of FAIs as in (21).\nLemma 4 allows us to restrict our considerations on bases only to sets of FAIs with saturated consequents. Thus, for brevity, for any \u0393 consisting of FAIs over Y , we let\nTh(\u0393, Y ) = {A \u21d2 [A]\u0393; A \u2208 L Y and A 6= [A]\u0393}. (22)\nTrivially, \u0393 and Th(\u0393, Y ) are equivalent and the consequents in all FAIs in Th(\u0393, Y ) are obviously saturated. For subsets \u03a3 \u2286 Th(\u0393, Y ), we have the following if-and-only-if condition for \u03a3 and \u0393 being equivalent.\nTheorem 5. For any \u03a3 \u2286 Th(\u0393, Y ), the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) \u03a3 and \u0393 are equivalent as sets of FAIs.\n(ii) For every A \u2208 LY such that A 6= [A]\u0393 :\nif A \u2208 Mod(\u03a3 \\ {A \u21d2 [A]\u0393}), then A \u21d2 [A]\u0393 \u2208 \u03a3.\nProof. Let \u03a3 and \u0393 be equivalent. Take any A \u2208 LY such that A 6= [A]\u0393. Moreover, let us assume that A \u21d2 [A]\u0393 6\u2208 \u03a3. Obviously, \u03a3 \\ {A \u21d2 [A]\u0393} = \u03a3, i.e., in order to prove (ii), it suffices to show that\nA 6\u2208 Mod(\u03a3 \\ {A \u21d2 [A]\u0393}) = Mod(\u03a3)\nbut this is indeed the case: A 6= [A]\u0393 means A 6\u2208 Mod(\u0393) and so Proposition 2 gives A 6\u2208 Mod(\u03a3) because \u03a3 and \u0393 are equivalent.\nConversely, assume that (ii) is satisfied. Since \u03a3 \u2286 Th(\u0393, Y ) and in addition\n\u0393 and Th(\u0393, Y ) are equivalent, Proposition 2 yields\nMod(\u0393) = Mod(Th(\u0393, Y )) \u2286 Mod(\u03a3).\nTherefore, in order to prove the equivalence of \u0393 and \u03a3, it suffices to check the converse inclusion. By contradiction, let us assume that Mod(\u03a3) * Mod(\u0393). Using this assumption, there is A \u2208 Mod(\u03a3) such that A 6\u2208 Mod(\u0393). Utilizing the fact A 6\u2208 Mod(\u0393), it directly follows that A 6= [A]\u0393. In addition, A \u2208 Mod(\u03a3) gives A \u2208 Mod(\u03a3\\{A \u21d2 [A]\u0393}). Hence, using (ii), we get A \u21d2 [A]\u0393 \u2208 \u03a3. Using the fact A \u2208 Mod(\u03a3) again, ||A \u21d2 [A]\u0393||A = 1, i.e., S(A,A) \u2217 \u2264 S([A]\u0393, A). The\nlast inequality gives\n1 = 1\u2217 = S(A,A)\u2217 \u2264 S([A]\u0393, A),\nwhich in fact shows that [A]\u0393 \u2286 A which together with the extensivity A \u2286 [A]\u0393 of [\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7]\u0393 contradicts A 6= [A]\u0393. Therefore, Mod(\u03a3) \u2286 Mod(\u0393), i.e., \u03a3 and \u0393 are equivalent owing to Proposition 2.\nThe following lemma shows that the converse implication to that in Theo-\nrem 5 (ii) constitutes a sufficient condition of non-redundancy.\nLemma 6. Let \u03a3 \u2286 Th(\u0393, Y ) be a set of FAIs satisfying the following condition: For every A \u21d2 [A]\u0393 \u2208 \u03a3, we have A \u2208 Mod(\u03a3 \\ {A \u21d2 [A]\u0393}). Then, \u03a3 is nonredundant.\nProof. Clearly, for any A \u21d2 [A]\u0393 \u2208 \u03a3, using the fact that A \u21d2 [A]\u0393 \u2208 Th(\u0393, Y ), i.e., A 6= [A]\u0393, it follows that ||A \u21d2 [A]\u0393||A < 1 and thus A 6\u2208 Mod(\u03a3). Hence, A \u2208 Mod(\u03a3 \\ {A \u21d2 [A]\u0393}) gives that A \u21d2 [A]\u0393 is not redundant in \u03a3 because the theories \u03a3 \\ {A \u21d2 [A]\u0393} and \u03a3 are not equivalent.\nExample 2. The converse implication to that in Lemma 6 does not hold in general. For instance, let L be a three-element Lukasiewicz chain and let \u2217 be the identity on L = {0, 0.5, 1}. Furthermore, consider \u03a3 such as\n\u03a3 = {{p} \u21d2 {p, q}, {} \u21d2 {0.5/q}}.\nObserve that \u03a3 is non-redundant. Indeed, we have that {} 6\u2208 Mod(\u03a3) because ||{} \u21d2 {0.5/q}||{} = 0.5 < 1 and ||{p} \u21d2 {p, q}||{} = 1, i.e., {} \u21d2 { 0.5/q} is not redundant in \u03a3. Furthermore,\n||{p} \u21d2 {p, q}||{p,0.5/q} = 1 \u2192 S({p, q}, {p, 0.5/q}) = 1 \u2192 0.5 = 0.5 < 1,\ni.e., {p, 0.5/q} 6\u2208 Mod(\u03a3). On the other hand, we clearly have\n||{} \u21d2 {0.5/q}||{p,0.5/q} = 1 \u2192 S({ 0.5/q}, {p, 0.5/q}) = 1 \u2192 1 = 1.\nAltogether, {p} \u21d2 {p, q} is not redundant in \u03a3. Also note that both FAIs in \u03a3 have saturated consequents since [{p}]\u03a3 = {p, q} and [{}]\u03a3 = {0.5/q}. Now, observe that for {p} \u21d2 {p, q} \u2208 \u03a3, we have\n||{} \u21d2 {0.5/q}||{p} = 1 \u2192 S({ 0.5/q}, {p})\n= 1 \u2192 ((0 \u2192 1) \u2227 (0.5 \u2192 0))\n= 1 \u2192 (1 \u2227 0.5) = 1 \u2192 0.5 = 0.5 < 1,\nwhich shows that {p} 6\u2208 Mod(\u03a3 \\ {{p} \u21d2 {p, q}}), i.e., the converse implication to that in Lemma 6 does not hold for general L. Let us note that an analogous observation can also be made for \u2217 being (4) or for L being the two-element Boolean algebra in which case at least three distinct attributes must be used to find a counterexample.\nIn the rest of this section, we pay attention to a condition which is derived from the assumption in Lemma 6. As we have shown, the condition in Lemma 6 is sufficient for non-redundancy but not necessary in general. Indeed, Example 2 shows a non-redundant \u03a3 \u2286 Th(\u0393, Y ) and a particular A \u21d2 [A]\u0393 \u2208 \u03a3 such that A 6\u2208 Mod(\u03a3 \\ {A \u21d2 [A]\u0393}). In general, if A \u2208 Mod(\u03a3 \\ {A \u21d2 [A]\u0393}) for A \u21d2 [A]\u0393 \u2208 \u03a3, we may say that A acts as a \u201cwitness\u201d of the non-redundancy of A \u21d2 [A]\u0393 in \u03a3 because A is a model of \u03a3 \\ {A \u21d2 [A]\u0393} but it is not a model of \u03a3, see Proposition 2. If A 6\u2208 Mod(\u03a3 \\ {A \u21d2 [A]\u0393}), A does not act as such a witness because A 6\u2208 Mod(\u03a3) and A 6\u2208 Mod(\u03a3 \\ {A \u21d2 [A]\u0393}). Therefore, for a non-redundant \u03a3 \u2286 Th(\u0393, Y ) we may consider whether its non-redundancy is witnessed by antecedents of FAIs in \u03a3 which is, in fact, a stronger requirement on non-redundancy. We introduce the key notion as follows.\nDefinition 7. Let \u03a3 be a non-redundant set of FAIs. We say that the nonredundancy of \u03a3 is witnessed (by the antecedents of FAIs in \u03a3) whenever for every A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u03a3, we have that A \u2208 Mod(\u03a3 \\ {A \u21d2 B}).\nRemark 3. Let us note that the general property A \u2208 Mod(\u03a3\\{A \u21d2 B}) whenever A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u03a3 may also be possessed by sets of FAIs which are redundant. For instance, one can consider \u03a3 = {{} \u21d2 {}} which trivially has this property.\nIn order to prove the existence of sets of FAIs which witnessed non-redundancy\nfor a particular setting of structures of degrees and hedges, we utilize the following technical observation which ensures the existence of a total strict order on antecedents of FAIs in a given set of FAIs.\nLemma 8. Let L be a complete residuated lattice with globalization, \u0393 be a\nfinite non-redundant set of FAIs with saturated consequents, and\nX = { A \u2208 LY ; A \u21d2 [A]\u0393 \u2208 \u0393 } . (23)\nThen, there exists a strict total order relation \u22b3 on X such that\n[B]\u0393\\{B\u21d2[B]\u0393} = [B]{A\u21d2[A]\u0393\u2208\u0393;A\u22b3B} (24)\nfor all B \u2208 X .\nProof. It is immediate that the claim holds trivially for \u0393 = \u2205. We inspect the situation for \u0393 6= \u2205. The finiteness of \u0393 gives that X is finite as well. We proceed by induction and assume that we have already found A1, . . . , An \u2208 X (n \u2265 0) such that A1 \u22b3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u22b3 An and we put\n\u03a8 = {A1 \u21d2 [A1]\u0393, . . . , An \u21d2 [An]\u0393}.\nIn order to prove the assertion, we check that if \u0393 \\ \u03a8 is non-empty, then it contains some B \u21d2 [B]\u0393 such that\n[B]\u0393\\{B\u21d2[B]\u0393} = [B]\u03a8\nfrom which we immediately get that A1 \u22b3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u22b3 An can be extended by An \u22b3 B, see (24). By contradiction, let us assume that \u0393 \\ \u03a8 is non-empty and no such B \u21d2 [B]\u0393 \u2208 \u0393 \\\u03a8 exists. Thus, we assume that for each B \u21d2 [B]\u0393 \u2208 \u0393 \\ \u03a8 we have [B]\u03a8 \u2282 [B]\u0393\\{B\u21d2[B]\u0393} because \u03a8 \u2286 \u0393 \\ {B \u21d2 [B]\u0393}.\nObserve that for each B0 \u21d2 [B0]\u0393 \u2208 \u0393 \\\u03a8, there is \u03a81 6= \u2205 which is minimal\nin the number of contained FAIs such that \u03a8 \u222a\u03a81 \u2286 \u0393 \\ {B0 \u21d2 [B0]\u0393} and\n[B0]\u03a8\u222a\u03a81 = [B0]\u0393\\{B0\u21d2[B0]\u0393}.\nTherefore, using the fact that \u2217 is globalization together with the last equality and the fact that [B0]\u03a8 \u2282 [B0]\u0393\\{B0\u21d2[B0]\u0393}, it follows that there must be some B1 \u21d2 [B1]\u0393 \u2208 \u03a81 \\ \u03a8 with B1 6= B0 such that the following conditions are satisfied:\n\u2022 B1 \u2286 [B0]\u03a8,\n\u2022 [B1]\u0393 \u2286 [B0]\u0393\\{B0\u21d2[B0]\u0393}, and thus\n\u2022 [B1]\u0393 \u2286 [B0]\u0393.\nNow, the same observation can be made for B1 \u21d2 [B1]\u0393. That is, there is some B2 \u21d2 [B2]\u0393 \u2208 \u0393 \\\u03a8 such that the following conditions are satisfied:\n\u2022 B2 \u2286 [B1]\u03a8,\n\u2022 [B2]\u0393 \u2286 [B1]\u0393\\{B1\u21d2[B1]\u0393}, and\n\u2022 [B2]\u0393 \u2286 [B1]\u0393.\nTherefore, we may repeat the idea over and over again to form a sufficiently long sequence B0, B1, B2, . . . in which, owing to the finiteness of \u0393, there must be two indices i < j such that Bi = Bj . As a consequence of the above-listed properties of the elements in the sequence, we obtain [Bi]\u03a8 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = [Bj ]\u03a8 as well as [Bi]\u0393 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = [Bj ]\u0393. Now, observe that using Bi 6= Bi+1, we trivially get\n||Bi+1 \u21d2 [Bi+1]\u0393||\u0393\\{Bi\u21d2[Bi]\u0393} = 1\nbecause Bi+1 \u21d2 [Bi+1]\u0393 \u2208 \u0393. Moreover, the fact that [Bi]\u0393 = [Bi+1]\u0393 yields\n||Bi+1 \u21d2 [Bi]\u0393||\u0393\\{Bi\u21d2[Bi]\u0393} = 1. (25)\nFinally, using Bi+1 \u2286 [Bi+1]\u03a8 = [Bi]\u03a8 and Proposition 1, we get that\n1 = ||Bi \u21d2 Bi+1||\u03a8 \u2264 ||Bi \u21d2 Bi+1||\u0393\\{Bi\u21d2[Bi]\u0393} (26)\non the account of \u03a8 \u2286 \u0393 \\ {Bi \u21d2 [Bi]\u0393}. Since the semantic entailment of FAIs is transitive, from (25) and (26) we further get\n||Bi \u21d2 [Bi]\u0393||\u0393\\{Bi\u21d2[Bi]\u0393} = 1\nwhich contradicts the non-redundancy of \u0393. As a result, A1 \u22b3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u22b3 An can always be extended by some B \u2208 X satisfying (24) provided that \u0393 \\ \u03a8 is non-empty. Since \u0393 is finite, this ultimately defines a strict total order on X satisfying (24).\nExample 3. Let us note that in general the existence of the strict total order described in Lemma 8 is not ensured if \u2217 is other than the globalization. For illustration, let us consider the same structure of truth degrees as in Example 2 with \u2217 being the identity. Furthermore, consider \u0393 such as\n\u0393 = {{0.5/r} \u21d2 {p, 0.5/q, 0.5/r}, {} \u21d2 {p}}.\nIn this case, we clearly have\n[{0.5/r}]\u0393\\{{0.5/r}\u21d2{p,0.5/q,0.5/r}} = [{ 0.5/r}]{{}\u21d2{p}} = {p, 0.5/r},\nwhich means that for \u22b3 satisfying (24) we must have {} \u22b3 {0.5/r}. On the other hand, we also have\n[{}]\u0393\\{{}\u21d2{p}} = [{}]{{0.5/r}\u21d2{p,0.5/q,0.5/r}} = { 0.5/p},\ni.e., {0.5/r} \u22b3 {}. Hence, \u22b3 cannot be a strict total order. Analogous counterexamples may also be found using other structures of degrees, including the three-element Go\u0308del chain with \u2217 being the identity.\nTheorem 9. Let L be a complete residuated lattice with globalization. Then,\nfor each finite non-redundant set of FAIs with saturated consequents there is an equivalent non-redundant set of FAIs with witnessed non-redundancy.\nProof. Let \u0393 be a non-redundant set of FAIs with saturated consequents. Recall that in this case, each A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u0393 is in fact in the form A \u21d2 [A]\u0393. In addition, since \u0393 is non-redundant, we have A 6= [A]\u0393 whenever A \u21d2 [A]\u0393 \u2208 \u0393, i.e., it follows that \u0393 \u2286 Th(\u0393, Y ). Now, put\n\u03a3 = { [A]\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u0393} \u21d2 [A]\u0393; A \u21d2 [A]\u0393 \u2208 \u0393 } . (27)\nFirst, we prove that \u03a3 and \u0393 are equivalent. According to Proposition 2, it means showing that Mod(\u0393) = Mod(\u03a3). Clearly, if M \u2208 Mod(\u0393) and for A \u21d2 [A]\u0393 \u2208 \u0393 we have [A]\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u0393} \u2286 M , then A \u2286 M because of the extensivity of [\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7]\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u0393} which directly gives [A]\u0393 \u2286 M on account of M \u2208 Mod(\u0393). As a consequence, we have Mod(\u0393) \u2286 Mod(\u03a3). Thus, it remains to prove the converse inclusion.\nTake any M \u2208 Mod(\u03a3). Applying Lemma 8, we assume that \u22b3 is the strict total order satisfying (24). Furthermore, for a given A \u21d2 [A]\u0393 \u2208 \u0393, we assume that ||B \u21d2 [B]\u0393||M = 1 holds for all B \u22b3 A. Using Lemma 8 and the fact that \u2217 is globalization [16], we may write\n[A]\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u0393} = A \u222a [B1]\u0393 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a [Bn]\u0393 (28)\nfor B1 \u22b3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u22b3 Bn \u22b3 A so that for the elements in the sequence, we have B1 \u2286 A, B2 \u2286 A \u222a [B1]\u0393, B3 \u2286 A \u222a [B1]\u0393 \u222a [B2]\u0393, . . . , i.e., in general\nBi \u2286 A \u222a \u22c3 {[Bk]\u0393; k < i}\nfor all i = 1, . . . , n. Now, suppose that A \u2286 M . It is easy to see that by induction over i = 1, . . . , n, it follows that\nBi \u2286 A \u222a \u22c3 {[Bk]\u0393; k < i} \u2286 M\nfor all i = 1, . . . , n. Since for each Bi \u21d2 [Bi]\u0393 \u2208 \u0393 we have Bi \u22b3 A and for such a formula we have assumed ||Bi \u21d2 [Bi]\u0393||M = 1, the previous inclusion gives [Bi]\u0393 \u2286 M for all i = 1, . . . , n. Therefore, from (28) it follows that\n[A]\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u0393} \u2286 M.\nFurthermore, (27) and M \u2208 Mod(\u03a3) together with the previous inclusion yield [A]\u0393 \u2286 M which proves ||A \u21d2 [A]\u0393||M = 1. Since A \u21d2 [A]\u0393 was taken as an arbitrary formula in \u0393, we get M \u2208 Mod(\u0393). Hence, \u0393 and \u03a3 are equivalent.\nWe now show that \u03a3 is non-redundant and its non-redundancy is witnessed. In order to see that, we check the condition in Lemma 6. Thus, take an arbitrary [A]\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u0393} \u21d2 [A]\u0393 \u2208 \u03a3. Notice that [A]\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u0393} is not a\nmodel of \u0393 because [A]\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u0393} \u2286 [A]\u0393 and the non-redundancy of \u0393 yields ||A \u21d2 [A]\u0393||\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u0393} < 1, i.e., [A]\u0393 * [A]\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u0393} and therefore we get that [A]\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u0393} \u2282 [A]\u0393, i.e., \u03a3 \u2286 Th(\u0393, Y ). Now, suppose that\n[B]\u0393\\{B\u21d2[B]\u0393} \u2286 [A]\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u0393}\nfor any [B]\u0393\\{B\u21d2[B]\u0393} \u21d2 [B]\u0393 \u2208 \u03a3 such that B 6= A. As an immediate consequence of the extensivity of [\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7]\u0393\\{B\u21d2[B]\u0393}, we get\nB \u2286 [A]\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u0393}.\nMoreover, B \u21d2 [B]\u0393 \u2208 \u0393 and since A 6= B, [A]\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u0393} is a model of all FAIs in \u0393 with the exception of A \u21d2 [A]\u0393, i.e., including B \u21d2 [B]\u0393 \u2208 \u0393. Therefore, it follows that\n[B]\u0393 \u2286 [A]\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u0393}.\nAs a consequence, [A]\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u0393} is a model of\n\u03a3 \\ {[A]\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u0393} \u21d2 [A]\u0393}.\nNow, apply Lemma 6.\nExample 4. The construction in Theorem 9 cannot be extended to any L with arbitrary \u2217. For instance, let L be the three-element Go\u0308del chain with \u2217 being the identity. Furthermore, let\n\u0393 = {{0.5/p} \u21d2 {0.5/p, 0.5/q, r}, {p} \u21d2 {p, q, r}}.\nThen, the corresponding \u03a3 given by (27) is\n\u03a3 = {{0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.5/r} \u21d2 {0.5/p, 0.5/q, r}, {p, 0.5/q, r} \u21d2 {p, q, r}}\nbecause, using the fact that \u2297 is \u2227, we have\n[{0.5/p}]{{p}\u21d2{p,q,r}} = { 0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.5/r},\n[{p}]{{0.5/p}\u21d2{0.5/p,0.5/q,r}} = {p, 0.5/q, r}.\nTrivially, {0.5/p} \u2208 Mod(\u03a3) because\n||{0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.5/r} \u21d2 {0.5/p, 0.5/q, r}||{0.5/p} = 0 \u2192 0 = 1,\n||{p, 0.5/q, r} \u21d2 {p, q, r}}||{0.5/p} = 0 \u2192 0 = 1.\nIn contrast, {0.5/p} 6\u2208 Mod(\u0393) since\n||{0.5/p} \u21d2 {0.5/p, 0.5/q, r}||{0.5/p} = 1 \u2192 0 = 0.\nHence, using Proposition 2, \u0393 and \u03a3 are not equivalent.\nThe following assertion gives a connection between sets of FAIs with witnessed non-redundancy and systems of pseudo-intents, see (17). As a consequence, under the assumption of \u2217 being the globalization, we establish a procedure for getting a non-redundant base given by pseudo-intents from any non-redundant base of a given L-context.\nTheorem 10. Let I = \u3008X,Y, I\u3009 be a formal L-context, \u03a3 be a non-redundant base of I. Then, the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) \u03a3 \u2286 Th(\u03a3, Y ) and the non-redundancy of \u03a3 is witnessed.\n(ii) There is a system P of pseudo-intents of I such that \u03a3 is given by (18).\nProof. Clearly, if \u03a3 is given by (18) for some system P of pseudo-intents of I, then \u03a3 \u2286 Th(\u03a3, Y ). Furthermore, since \u03a3 is complete in I, we haveM\u2193\u2191 = [M ]\u03a3 for all M \u2208 LY , see [18, Theorem 5.3]. Now, assume that (i) holds. Since \u03a3 is complete in I, Theorem 5 yields that for each P 6= P \u2193\u2191, we have P \u21d2 P \u2193\u2191 \u2208 \u03a3 provided that P \u2208 Mod(\u03a3 \\ {P \u21d2 P \u2193\u2191}). In addition to that, the fact that the non-redundancy of \u03a3 is witnessed gives that for each P 6= P \u2193\u2191, we have P \u2208 Mod(\u03a3 \\ {P \u21d2 P \u2193\u2191}) provided that P \u21d2 P \u2193\u2191 \u2208 \u03a3. Altogether, for each P 6= P \u2193\u2191, we have"}, {"heading": "P \u21d2 P \u2193\u2191 \u2208 \u03a3 iff P \u2208 Mod(\u03a3 \\ {P \u21d2 P \u2193\u2191}).", "text": "Thus, for P = {P \u2208 LY ; P \u21d2 P \u2193\u2191 \u2208 \u03a3}, it follows that for each P 6= P \u2193\u2191:\nP \u2208 P iff P \u2208 Mod(\u03a3 \\ {P \u21d2 P \u2193\u2191}).\nNow, observe that P \u2208 Mod(\u03a3 \\ {P \u21d2 P \u2193\u2191}) is true iff for each Q \u21d2 Q\u2193\u2191 \u2208 \u03a3 such that Q 6= P , we have ||Q \u21d2 Q\u2193\u2191||P = 1 Hence, for each P 6= P \u2193\u2191:\nP \u2208 P iff ||Q \u21d2 Q\u2193\u2191||P = 1 for any Q \u2208 P such that Q 6= P.\nAltogether, P is a system of pseudo-intents and \u03a3 is of the form (18) which proves (ii). Conversely, (i) is a direct consequence of (ii).\nCorollary 11. Let I = \u3008X,Y, I\u3009 be a formal L-context and let \u0393 be a nonredundant base of I which consists of FAIs with saturated consequents. If L is finite and \u2217 is globalization, then \u03a3 given by (27) is a minimal base of I and\nP = {A \u2208 LY; A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u03a3} (29)\nis a system of pseudo-intents of I.\nProof. Apply Theorem 9 and Theorem 10. The minimality of \u03a3 then follows by [18, Theorem 5.20], cf. also [9].\nRemark 4. Corollary 11 allows us to find a non-redundant base of I given by a system of pseudo-intents in an alternative way. The method is restricted to \u2217 being globalization but as we shall see in Section 5, the procedure may produce the desired base even in case of general hedges and our experiments indicate that this happens frequently. Compared to the graph-based method discussed in Section 3, such an approach is considerably faster."}, {"heading": "5 Experimental Observations and Comments", "text": "In this section, we present an additional experimental insight into the problem of computing sets of FAIs with witnessed non-redundancy based on the observation in the proof of Theorem 9 and Corollary 11. Recall that the assertions presuppose that the utilized hedge is a globalization and Example 4 shows that the procedure cannot be extended for arbitrary hedges in general. That is, if \u0393 is finite and non-redundant set of FAIs with saturated consequents, it can happen that \u03a3 given by (27) is not equivalent to \u0393. A question is whether such\nsituations are frequent or rare. The first series of our experiments focuses on this phenomenon.\nWe have performed experiments with randomly generated non-redundant sets of FAIs with saturated consequents using structures of truth degrees defined on 11-element equidistant subchains of the real unit interval. The utilized structures of degrees were all BL-algebras [35, 36] which can be defined on such chains. It is a well-known fact that such BL-algebras result as ordinal sums [35] of finite linear Lukasiewicz algebras and are given solely by the elements which are idempotent with respect to \u2297, see [38, 23]. The hedge was always considered as the identity. Recall that in this setting, \u03a3 given by (27) is not equivalent to the input \u0393 in general. Nevertheless, our experimental observations show that with growing number of idempotents in the structure, the ratio of successful transformations of \u0393 to an equivalent \u03a3 given by (27) is decreasing. Figure 1 shows the mean percentages of successful transformations depending on the number of idempotents in linear 11-element BL-algebras with \u2217 being the identity. The graph was generated using more than 106 randomly generated sets of\nFAIs consisting of 20 formulas using up to 10 distinct attributes. Interestingly, in case of the 11-element Lukasiewicz chain (the case of only 2 idempotents), the transformation was always successful. Therefore, we hypothesize that at least on finite Lukasiewicz chains, Theorem 9 can be extended to \u2217 being the identity. To prove this hypothesis is an interesting open problem. Note that due to Example 3, one cannot use the proof technique of Theorem 9 because the utilized strict total order described in Lemma 8 may not exist. Also note that even in the worst case which seems to be the 11-element Go\u0308del chain (all elements idempotent), the percentage of successes is relatively high (above 87%), i.e., we can say that even if Theorem 9 does not hold for general hedges, the chance of obtaining a desired equivalent set of FAIs with witnessed non-redundancy is relatively high.\nOur next experiment shows the comparison of running times needed to determine a non-redundant base given by systems of pseudo-intents using the graph-based method outlined in Section 3 and the alternative method based on removing redundant FAIs from a complete set consisting of FAIs with saturated consequents and then applying Theorem 9. Figure 2 shows the alter-\nnative method is (as expected) faster by an order of several magnitudes. The graph was generated based on observing the running time of the algorithms for 105 randomly generated contexts with 50 objects and (only) 4 attributes using a three-element Lukasiewicz chain. For higher numbers of attributes and/or higher numbers of truth degrees, the graph-based method is practically not applicable. The graph in Figure 2 shows the dependency of the mean running time on the density of input data sets which is for I = \u3008X,Y, I\u3009 introduced as\n\u2211\nx\u2208X\n\u2211\ny\u2208Y I(x, y)\n|X | \u00b7 |Y | \u00b7 100. (30)\nNotice that Figure 2 shows that the tendency of the graph-based algorithm is that for sparse datasets (i.e., datasets where the value of (30) is small) the running time is higher than for more dense datasets. This is caused by the fact that in such cases, the graphs associated to input data are usually more complex. On the contrary, Figure 3 and Figure 4 show that in the case of the alternative algorithm, the running time more or less copies the size of the computed bases (in terms of the number of formulas contained in the bases). This behavior may be considered more natural. For both, we have used the same parameters: L with 5 truth degrees and 104 randomly generated datasets with 10 objects and 10 attributes.\nTo sum up, the experiments presented in this section indicate that (i) the method of computing bases with witnessed non-redundancy presented in this paper can be applied even if \u2217 is not a globalization and its success rate is relatively high, and (ii) the method significantly outperforms the graph-based method. As we have mentioned in the section, further investigation regarding the existence of systems of pseudo-intents for general hedges and possible generalizations of Theorem 9 are needed and we consider these important open problems."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "Supported by grant no.
