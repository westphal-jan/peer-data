Introduction", "text": "Graphs have been extensively studied for their propagative abilities: connectivity, routing, gossip algorithms, etc. A diffusion process taking place over a graph provides valuable information about the presence and weights of its edges. Influence cascades are a specific type of diffusion processes in which a particular infectious behavior spreads over the nodes of the graph. By only observing the \u201cinfection times\u201d of the nodes in the graph, one might hope to recover the underlying graph and the parameters of the cascade model. This problem is known in the literature as the Network Inference problem.\nMore precisely, solving the Network Inference problem involves designing an algorithm taking as input a set of\nProceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Lille, France, 2015. JMLR: W&CP volume 37. Copyright 2015 by the author(s).\nobserved cascades (realisations of the diffusion process) and recovers with high probability a large fraction of the graph\u2019s edges. The goal is then to understand the relationship between the number of observations, the probability of success, and the accuracy of the reconstruction.\nThe Network Inference problem can be decomposed and analyzed \u201cnode-by-node\u201d. Thus, we will focus on a single node of degree s and discuss how to identify its parents among the m nodes of the graph. Prior work has shown that the required number of observed cascades is O(poly(s) logm) (Netrapalli & Sanghavi, 2012; Abrahao et al., 2013).\nA more recent line of research (Daneshmand et al., 2014) has focused on applying advances in sparse recovery to the network inference problem. Indeed, the graph can be interpreted as a \u201csparse signal\u201d measured through influence cascades and then recovered. The challenge is that influence cascade models typically lead to non-linear inverse problems and the measurements (the state of the nodes at different time steps) are usually correlated. The sparse recovery literature suggests that \u2126(s log ms ) cascade observations should be sufficient to recover the graph (Donoho, 2006; Candes & Tao, 2006). However, the best known upper bound to this day is O(s2 logm) (Netrapalli & Sanghavi, 2012; Daneshmand et al., 2014)\nThe contributions of this paper are the following: \u2022 we formulate the Graph Inference problem in the con-\ntext of discrete-time influence cascades as a sparse recovery problem for a specific type of Generalized Linear Model. This formulation notably encompasses the well-studied Independent Cascade Model and Voter Model.\n\u2022 we give an algorithm which recovers the graph\u2019s edges using O(s logm) cascades. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm is also able to efficiently recover the edge weights (the parameters of the influence model) up to an additive error term,\n\u2022 we show that our algorithm is robust in cases where the signal to recover is approximately s-sparse by\nar X\niv :1\n50 5.\n05 66\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.S I]\n2 1\nM ay\n2 01\nproving guarantees in the stable recovery setting.\n\u2022 we provide an almost tight lower bound of \u2126(s log ms ) observations required for sparse recovery.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows: we conclude the introduction by a survey of the related work. In Section 2 we present our model of Generalized Linear Cascades and the associated sparse recovery formulation. Its theoretical guarantees are presented for various recovery settings in Section 3. The lower bound is presented in Section 4. Finally, we conclude with experiments in Section 5.\nRelated Work The study of edge prediction in graphs has been an active field of research for over a decade (Liben-Nowell & Kleinberg, 2008; Leskovec et al., 2007; Adar & Adamic, 2005). (Gomez Rodriguez et al., 2010) introduced the NETINF algorithm, which approximates the likelihood of cascades represented as a continuous process. The algorithm was improved in later work (Gomez-Rodriguez et al., 2011), but is not known to have any theoretical guarantees beside empirical validation on synthetic networks. Netrapalli & Sanghavi (2012) studied the discrete-time version of the independent cascade model and obtained the first O(s2 logm) recovery guarantee on general networks. The algorithm is based on a likelihood function similar to the one we propose, without the `1-norm penalty. Their analysis depends on a correlation decay assumption, which limits the number of new infections at every step. In this setting, they show a lower bound of the number of cascades needed for support recovery with constant probability of the order \u2126(s log(m/s)). They also suggest a GREEDY algorithm, which achieves aO(s logm) guarantee in the case of tree graphs. The work of (Abrahao et al., 2013) studies the same continuous-model framework as (Gomez Rodriguez et al., 2010) and obtains an O(s9 log2 s logm) support recovery algorithm, without the correlation decay assumption. (Du et al., 2013) propose a similar algorithm to ours for recovering the weights of the graph under a continuous-time independent cascade model, without proving theoretical guarantees.\nClosest to this work is a recent paper by Daneshmand et al. (2014), wherein the authors consider a `1-regularized objective function. They adapt standard results from sparse recovery to obtain a recovery bound of O(s3 logm) under an irrepresentability condition (Zhao & Yu, 2006). Under stronger assumptions, they match the (Netrapalli & Sanghavi, 2012) bound of O(s2 logm), by exploiting similar properties of the convex program\u2019s KKT conditions. In contrast, our work studies discrete-time diffusion processes including the Independent Cascade model under weaker assumptions. Furthermore, we analyze both the recovery of the graph\u2019s edges and the estimation of the model\u2019s parameters, and achieve close to optimal bounds.\nThe work of (Du et al., 2014) is slightly orthogonal to ours since they suggest learning the influence function, rather than the parameters of the network directly."}, {"heading": "2. Model", "text": "We consider a graph G = (V,E,\u0398), where \u0398 is a |V | \u00d7 |V | matrix of parameters describing the edge weights of G. Intuitively, \u0398i,j captures the \u201cinfluence\u201d of node i on node j. Let m \u2261 |V |. For each node j, let \u03b8j be the jth column vector of \u0398. A discrete-time Cascade model is a Markov process over a finite state space {0, 1, . . . ,K \u2212 1}V with the following properties:\n1. Conditioned on the previous time step, the transition events between two states in {0, 1, . . . ,K \u2212 1} for each i \u2208 V are mutually independent across i \u2208 V .\n2. Of the K possible states, there exists a contagious state such that all transition probabilities of the Markov process can be expressed as a function of the graph parameters \u0398 and the set of \u201ccontagious nodes\u201d at the previous time step.\n3. The initial probability over {0, 1, . . . ,K \u2212 1}V is such that all nodes can eventually reach a contagious state with non-zero probability. The \u201ccontagious\u201d nodes at t = 0 are called source nodes.\nIn other words, a cascade model describes a diffusion process where a set of contagious nodes \u201cinfluence\u201d other nodes in the graph to become contagious. An influence cascade is a realisation of this random process, i.e. the successive states of the nodes in graph G. Note that both the \u201csingle source\u201d assumption made in (Daneshmand et al., 2014) and (Abrahao et al., 2013) as well as the \u201cuniformly chosen source set\u201d assumption made in (Netrapalli & Sanghavi, 2012) verify condition 3. Also note that the multiple-source node assumption does not reduce to the single-source assumption, even under the assumption that cascades do not overlap. Imagining for example two cascades starting from two different nodes; since we do not observe which node propagated the contagion to which node, we cannot attribute an infected node to either cascade and treat the problem as two independent cascades.\nIn the context of Network Inference, (Netrapalli & Sanghavi, 2012) focus on the well-known discrete-time independent cascade model recalled below, which (Abrahao et al., 2013) and (Daneshmand et al., 2014) generalize to continuous time. We extend the independent cascade model in a different direction by considering a more general class of transition probabilities while staying in the discrete-time setting. We observe that despite their obvious differences, both the independent cascade and the voter models make\nthe network inference problem similar to the standard generalized linear model inference problem. In fact, we define a class of diffusion processes for which this is true: the Generalized Linear Cascade Models. The linear threshold model is a special case and is discussed in Section 6."}, {"heading": "2.1.

We draw inspiration from generalized linear models to introduce Generalized Linear Cascades:\nDefinition 1. Let Xt be the indicator variable of \u201ccontagious nodes\u201d at time step t. A generalized linear cascade model is a cascade model such that for each susceptible node j in state s at time step t, the probability of j becoming \u201ccontagious\u201d at time step t+ 1 conditioned on Xt is a Bernoulli variable of parameter f(\u03b8j \u00b7Xt):\nP(Xt+1j = 1|X t) = f(\u03b8j \u00b7Xt) (1)\nwhere f : R\u2192 [0, 1]\nIn other words, each generalized linear cascade provides, for each node j \u2208 V a series of measurements (Xt, Xt+1j )t\u2208Tj sampled from a generalized linear model. Note also that E[Xt+1i |Xt] = f(\u03b8i \u00b7Xt). As such, f can be interpreted as the inverse link function of our generalized linear cascade model."}, {"heading": "2.2. Examples", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.2.1. INDEPENDENT CASCADE MODEL", "text": "In the independent cascade model, nodes can be either susceptible, contagious or immune. At t = 0, all source nodes are \u201ccontagious\u201d and all remaining nodes are \u201csusceptible\u201d. At each time step t, for each edge (i, j) where j is susceptible and i is contagious, i attempts to infect j with probability pi,j \u2208 [0, 1]; the infection attempts are mutually independent. If i succeeds, j will become contagious at time step t+1. Regardless of i\u2019s success, node i will be immune at time t+ 1, such that nodes stay contagious for only one time step. The cascade process terminates when no contagious nodes remain.\nIf we denote by Xt the indicator variable of the set of contagious nodes at time step t, then if j is susceptible at time step t+ 1, we have:\nP [ Xt+1j = 1 |X t ] = 1\u2212 m\u220f i=1 (1\u2212 pi,j)X t i .\nDefining \u0398i,j \u2261 log( 11\u2212pi,j ), this can be rewritten as:\nP [ Xt+1j = 1 |X t ] = 1\u2212 m\u220f i=1 e\u2212\u0398i,jX t i (IC)\n= 1\u2212 e\u2212\u0398j \u00b7X t\nTherefore, the independent cascade model is a Generalized Linear Cascade model with inverse link function f : z 7\u2192 1\u2212e\u2212z . Note that to write the Independent Cascade Model as a Generalized Linear Cascade Model, we had to introduce the change of variable \u0398i,j = log( 11\u2212pi,j ). The recovery results in Section 3 pertain to the \u0398j parameters.

Each round, every node j independently chooses one of its neighbors with probability \u0398i,j and adopts their color. The cascades stops at a fixed horizon time T or if all nodes are of the same color.

DISCRETIZATION OF CONTINUOUS MODEL", "text": "Another motivation for the Generalized Linear Cascade model is that it captures the time-discretized formulation of the well-studied continuous-time independent cascade model with exponential transmission function (CICE) of (Gomez Rodriguez et al., 2010; Abrahao et al., 2013; Daneshmand et al., 2014). Assume that the temporal resolution of the discretization is \u03b5, i.e. all nodes whose (continuous) infection time is within the interval [k\u03b5, (k + 1)\u03b5) are considered infected at (discrete) time step k. Let Xk be the indicator vector of the set of nodes \u2018infected\u2019 before or during the kth time interval. Note that contrary to the discrete-time independent cascade model, Xkj = 1 =\u21d2 Xk+1j = 1, that is, there is no immune state and nodes remain contagious forever.\nLet Exp(p) be an exponentially-distributed random variable of parameter p and let \u0398i,j be the rate of transmis-\nsion along directed edge (i, j) in the CICE model. By the memoryless property of the exponential, if Xkj 6= 1:\nP(Xk+1j = 1|X k) = P( min i\u2208N (j) Exp(\u0398i,j) \u2264 )\n= P(Exp( m\u2211 i=1 \u0398i,jX t i ) \u2264 ) = 1\u2212 e\u2212 \u0398j \u00b7X t\nTherefore, the -discretized CICE-induced process is a Generalized Linear Cascade model with inverse link function f : z 7\u2192 1\u2212 e\u2212 \u00b7z ."}, {"heading": "2.2.4. LOGISTIC CASCADES", "text": "\u201cLogistic cascades\u201d is the specific case where the inverse link function is given by the logistic function f(z) = 1/(1 + e\u2212z+t). Intuitively, this captures the idea that there is a threshold t such that when the sum of the parameters of the infected parents of a node is larger than the threshold, the probability of getting infected is close to one. This is a smooth approximation of the hard threshold rule of the Linear Threshold Model (Kempe et al., 2003). As we will see later in the analysis, for logistic cascades, the graph inference problem becomes a linear inverse problem."}, {"heading": "2.3. Maximum Likelihood Estimation", "text": "Inferring the model parameter \u0398 from observed influence cascades is the central question of the present work. Recovering the edges in E from observed influence cascades is a well-identified problem known as the Network Inference problem. However, recovering the influence parameters is no less important. In this work we focus on recovering \u0398, noting that the set of edgesE can then be recovered through the following equivalence: (i, j) \u2208 E \u21d4 \u0398i,j 6= 0\nGiven observations (x1, . . . , xn) of a cascade model, we can recover \u0398 via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Denoting byL the log-likelihood function, we consider the following `1-regularized MLE problem:\n\u0398\u0302 \u2208 argmax \u0398\n1 n L(\u0398 |x1, . . . , xn)\u2212 \u03bb\u2016\u0398\u20161\nwhere \u03bb is the regularization factor which helps prevent\noverfitting and controls the sparsity of the solution.\nThe generalized linear cascade model is decomposable in the following sense: given Definition 1, the log-likelihood can be written as the sum of m terms, each term i \u2208 {1, . . . ,m} only depending on \u03b8i. Since this is equally true for \u2016\u0398\u20161, each column \u03b8i of \u0398 can be estimated by a separate optimization program:\n\u03b8\u0302i \u2208 argmax \u03b8 Li(\u03b8i |x1, . . . , xn)\u2212 \u03bb\u2016\u03b8i\u20161 (2)\nwhere we denote by Ti the time steps at which node i is susceptible and:\nLi(\u03b8i |x1, . . . , xn) = 1 |Ti| \u2211 t\u2208Ti xt+1i log f(\u03b8i \u00b7 x t)\n+ (1\u2212 xt+1i ) log ( 1\u2212 f(\u03b8i \u00b7 xt) ) In the case of the voter model, the measurements include all time steps until we reach the time horizon T or the graph coalesces to a single state. For the independent cascade model, the measurements include all time steps until node i becomes contagious, after which its behavior is deterministic. Contrary to prior work, our results depend on the number of measurements and not the number of cascades.\nRegularity assumptions To solve program (2) efficiently, we would like it to be convex. A sufficient condition is to assume that Li is concave, which is the case if f and (1\u2212 f) are both log-concave. Remember that a twicedifferentiable function f is log-concave iff. f \u2032\u2032f \u2264 f \u20322. It is easy to verify this property for f and (1 \u2212 f) in the Independent Cascade Model and Voter Model.\nFurthermore, the data-dependent bounds in Section 3.1 will require the following regularity assumption on the inverse link function f : there exists \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) such that\nmax { |(log f)\u2032(zx)|, |(log(1\u2212 f))\u2032(zx)| } \u2264 1 \u03b1 (LF)\nfor all zx \u2261 \u03b8\u2217 \u00b7 x such that f(zx) /\u2208 {0, 1}.\nIn the voter model, f \u2032(z) f(z) = 1 z and f \u2032(z) (1\u2212f)(z) = 1 1\u2212z . Hence (LF) will hold as soon as \u03b1 \u2264 \u0398i,j \u2264 1\u2212 \u03b1 for all (i, j) \u2208 E which is always satisfied for some \u03b1 for non-isolated nodes. In the Independent Cascade Model, f\n\u2032(z) f(z) = 1 ez\u22121\nand f \u2032(z)\n(1\u2212f)(z) = 1. Hence (LF) holds as soon as pi,j \u2265 \u03b1 for all (i, j) \u2208 E which is always satisfied for some \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1).\nFor the data-independent bound of Proposition 1, we will require the following additional regularity assumption:\nmax { |(log f)\u2032\u2032(zx)|, |(log(1\u2212 f))\u2032\u2032(zx)| } \u2264 1 \u03b1 (LF2)\nfor some \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) and for all zx \u2261 \u03b8\u2217\u00b7x such that f(zx) /\u2208 {0, 1}. It is again easy to see that this condition is verified for the Independent Cascade Model and the Voter model for the same \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1).\nConvex constraints The voter model is only defined when \u0398i,j \u2208 (0, 1) for all (i, j) \u2208 E. Similarly the independent cascade model is only defined when \u0398i,j > 0. Because the likelihood function Li is equal to \u2212\u221e when the parameters are outside of the domain of definition of the models, these contraints do not need to appear explicitly in the optimization program. In the specific case of the voter model, the constraint\u2211 j \u0398i,j = 1 will not necessarily be verified by the estimator obtained in (2). In some applications, the experimenter might not need this constraint to be verified, in which case the results in Section 3 still give a bound on the recovery error. If this constraint needs to be satisfied, then by Lagrangian duality, there exists a \u03bb \u2208 R such that adding \u03bb (\u2211 j \u03b8j \u2212 1 ) to the objective function of (2) enforces the constraint. Then, it suffices to apply the results of Section 3 to the augmented objective to obtain the same recovery guarantees. Note that the added term is linear and will easily satisfy all the required regularity assumptions."}, {"heading": "3. Results", "text": "In this section, we apply the sparse recovery framework to analyze under which assumptions our program (2) recovers the true parameter \u03b8i of the cascade model. Furthermore, if we can estimate \u03b8i to a sufficiently good accuracy, it is then possible to recover the support of \u03b8i by simple thresholding, which provides a solution to the standard Network Inference problem.\nWe will first give results in the exactly sparse setting in which \u03b8i has a support of size exactly s. We will then relax this sparsity constraint and give results in the stable recovery setting where \u03b8i is approximately s-sparse.\nAs mentioned in Section 2.3, the maximum likelihood estimation program is decomposable.

Since L is twice differentiable and convex, assumption (4) with \u03baL = \u03b32 is implied by the (RE)-condition.

This departs from the usual assumptions made in sparse recovery settings, that the measurements are independent from one another. We now show how to use Theorem 1 to recover the support of \u03b8\u2217, that is, to solve the Network Inference problem.\nCorollary 1.

In other words, even if \u03b8\u2217 is not exactly s-sparse, it can be well approximated by s-sparse vectors.\nRather than obtaining an impossibility result, we show that the bounds obtained in Section 3.1 degrade gracefully in this setting. Formally, let \u03b8\u2217bsc \u2208 argmin\u2016\u03b8\u20160\u2264s \u2016\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\n\u2217\u20161 be the best s-approximation to \u03b8\u2217.

Restricted Eigenvalue Condition", "text": "There exists a large class of sufficient conditions under which sparse recovery is achievable in the context of regularized estimation (van de Geer & B\u00fchlmann, 2009). The restricted eigenvalue condition, introduced in (Bickel et al., 2009b), is one of the weakest such assumption. It can be interpreted as a restricted form of non-degeneracy. Since we apply it to the Hessian of the log-likelihood function \u22072L(\u03b8), it essentially reduces to a form of restricted strong convexity, that Lemma 2 ultimately relies on.\nObserve that the Hessian of L can be seen as a re-weighted Gram matrix of the observations:\n\u22072L(\u03b8\u2217) = 1 |T | \u2211 t\u2208T xt(xt)T [ xt+1i f \u2032\u2032f \u2212 f \u20322 f2 (\u03b8\u2217 \u00b7 xt)\n\u2212 (1\u2212 xt+1i ) f \u2032\u2032(1\u2212 f) + f \u20322\n(1\u2212 f)2 (\u03b8\u2217 \u00b7 xt) ] If f and (1 \u2212 f) are c-strictly log-convex for c > 0, then min ((log f)\u2032\u2032, (log(1\u2212 f))\u2032\u2032) \u2265 c. This implies that the (S, \u03b3)-(RE) condition in Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 reduces to a condition on the Gram matrix of the observations XTX = 1|T | \u2211 t\u2208T x t(xt)T for \u03b3\u2032 \u2261 \u03b3 \u00b7 c.\n(RE) with high probability The Generalized Linear Cascade model yields a probability distribution over the observed sets of infected nodes (xt)t\u2208T . It is then natural to ask whether the restricted eigenvalue condition is likely to occur under this probabilistic model. Several recent papers show that large classes of correlated designs obey the restricted eigenvalue property with high probability (Raskutti et al., 2010; Rudelson & Zhou, 2013).\nThe (RE)-condition has the following concentration property: if it holds for the expected Hessian matrix E[\u22072L(\u03b8\u2217)], then it holds for the finite sample Hessian matrix \u22072L(\u03b8\u2217) with high probability.\nTherefore, under an assumption which only involves the probabilistic model and not the actual observations, we can obtain the same conclusion as in Theorem 1: Proposition 1. Suppose E[\u22072L(\u03b8\u2217)] verifies the (S, \u03b3)(RE) condition and assume (LF) and (LF2). For \u03b4 > 0, if n1\u2212\u03b4 \u2265 128\u03b3\u03b1s\n2 logm, then\u22072L(\u03b8\u2217) verifies the (S, \u03b32 )- (RE) condition, w.p \u2265 1\u2212 e\u2212n\u03b4 logm.\nObserve that the number of measurements required in Proposition 1 is now quadratic in s. If we only keep the first measurement from each cascade, which are independent, we can apply Theorem 1.8 from (Rudelson & Zhou, 2013), lowering the number of required cascades to s logm log3(s logm).\nIf f and (1 \u2212 f) are strictly log-convex, then the previous observations show that the quantity E[\u22072L(\u03b8\u2217)] in Proposition 1 can be replaced by the expected Gram matrix: A \u2261 E[XTX]. This matrix A has a natural interpretation: the entry ai,j is the probability that node i and node j are infected at the same time during a cascade. In particular, the diagonal term ai,i is simply the probability that node i is infected during a cascade."}, {"heading": "4. A Lower Bound", "text": "In (Netrapalli & Sanghavi, 2012), the authors explicitate a lower bound of \u2126(s log ms ) on the number of cascades necessary to achieve good support recovery with constant probability under a correlation decay assumption. In this section, we will consider the stable sparse recovery setting of Section 3.2. Our goal is to obtain an informationtheoretic lower bound on the number of measurements necessary to approximately recover the parameter \u03b8\u2217 of a cascade model from observed cascades. Similar lower bounds were obtained for sparse linear inverse problems in (Price & Woodruff, 2011; 2012; Ba et al., 2011). Theorem 3. Let us consider a cascade model of the form (1) and a recovery algorithmA which takes as input n random cascade measurements and outputs \u03b8\u0302 such that with probability \u03b4 > 12 (over the measurements):\n\u2016\u03b8\u0302 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217\u20162 \u2264 C min \u2016\u03b8\u20160\u2264s \u2016\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217\u20162 (5)\nwhere \u03b8\u2217 is the true parameter of the cascade model. Then n = \u2126(s log ms / logC).\nThis theorem should be contrasted with Theorem 2: up to an additive s log s factor, the number of measurements required by our algorithm is tight. The proof of Theorem 3 follows an approach similar to (Price & Woodruff, 2012). We present a sketch of the proof in the Appendix and refer the reader to their paper for more details."}, {"heading": "5. Experiments", "text": "In this section, we validate empirically the results and assumptions of Section 3 for varying levels of sparsity and different initializations of parameters (n,m, \u03bb, pinit), where pinit is the initial probability of a node being a source node. We compare our algorithm to two different state-of-the-art algorithms: GREEDY and MLE from (Netrapalli & Sanghavi, 2012). As an extra benchmark, we also introduce\na new algorithm LASSO, which approximates our SPARSE MLE algorithm.\nExperimental setup We evaluate the performance of the algorithms on synthetic graphs, chosen for their similarity to real social networks. We therefore consider a WattsStrogatz graph (300 nodes, 4500 edges) (Watts & Strogatz, 1998), a Barabasi-Albert graph (300 nodes, 16200 edges) (Albert & Barab\u00e1si, 2001), a Holme-Kim power law graph (200 nodes, 9772 edges) (Holme & Kim, 2002), and the recently introduced Kronecker graph (256 nodes, 10000 edges) (Leskovec et al., 2010). Undirected graphs are converted to directed graphs by doubling the edges.\nFor every reported data point, we sample edge weights and generate n cascades from the (IC) model for n \u2208 {100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000}. We compare for each algorithm the estimated graph G\u0302 with G. The initial probability of a node being a source is fixed to 0.05, i.e. an average of 15 nodes source nodes per cascades for all experiments, except for Figure (f). All edge weights are chosen uniformly in the interval [0.2, 0.7], except when testing for approximately sparse graphs (see paragraph on robustness). Adjusting for the variance of our experiments, all data points are reported with at most a \u00b11 error margin. The parameter \u03bb is chosen to be of the order O( \u221a logm/(\u03b1n)). We report our results as a function of the number of cascades and not the number of measurements: in practice, very few cascades have depth greater than 3.\nBenchmarks We compare our SPARSE MLE algorithm to 3 benchmarks: GREEDY and MLE from (Netrapalli & Sanghavi, 2012) and LASSO. The MLE algorithm is a maximum-likelihood estimator without `1-norm penalization. GREEDY is an iterative algorithm. We introduced the LASSO algorithm in our experiments to achieve faster computation time:\n\u03b8\u0302i \u2208 arg min \u03b8 \u2211 t\u2208T |f(\u03b8i \u00b7 xt)\u2212 xt+1i | 2 + \u03bb\u2016\u03b8i\u20161\nLASSO has the merit of being both easier and faster to optimize numerically than the other convex-optimization based algorithms. It approximates the SPARSE MLE algorithm by making the assumption that the observations xt+1i are of the form: xt+1i = f(\u03b8i \u00b7xt)+ , where is random white noise. This is not valid in theory since depends on f(\u03b8i \u00b7 xt), however the approximation is validated in practice.\nWe did not benchmark against other known algorithms (NETRATE (Gomez-Rodriguez et al., 2011) and FIRST EDGE (Abrahao et al., 2013)) due to the discrete-time assumption. These algorithms also suppose a single-source model, whereas SPARSE MLE, MLE, and GREEDY do not. Learning the graph in the case of a multi-source cascade\nmodel is harder (see Figure 2 (f)) but more realistic, since we rarely have access to \u201cpatient 0\u201d in practice.\nGraph Estimation In the case of the LASSO, MLE and SPARSE MLE algorithms, we construct the edges of G\u0302 : \u222aj\u2208V {(i, j) : \u0398ij > 0.1}, i.e by thresholding. Finally, we report the F1-score= 2precision\u00b7recall/(precision+recall), which considers (1) the number of true edges recovered by the algorithm over the total number of edges returned by the algorithm (precision) and (2) the number of true edges recovered by the algorithm over the total number of edges it should have recovered (recall). Over all experiments, SPARSE MLE achieves higher rates of precision, recall, and F1-score. Interestingly, both MLE and SPARSE MLE perform exceptionally well on the Watts-Strogatz graph.\nQuantifying robustness The previous experiments only considered graphs with strong edges. To test the algorithms in the approximately sparse case, we add sparse edges to the previous graphs according to a bernoulli variable of parameter 1/3 for every non-edge, and drawing a weight uniformly from [0, 0.1]. The non-sparse case is compared to the sparse case in Figure 2 (d)\u2013(e) for the `2 norm showing that both the LASSO, followed by SPARSE MLE are the most robust to noise."}, {"heading": "6. Future Work", "text": "Solving the Graph Inference problem with sparse recovery techniques opens new venues for future work. Firstly, the sparse recovery literature has already studied regularization patterns beyond the `1-norm, notably the thresholded and adaptive lasso (van de Geer et al., 2011; Zou, 2006). Another goal would be to obtain confidence intervals for our estimator, similarly to what has been obtained for the Lasso in the recent series of papers (Javanmard & Montanari, 2014; Zhang & Zhang, 2014).\nFinally, the linear threshold model is a commonly studied diffusion process and can also be cast as a generalized linear cascade with inverse link function z 7\u2192 1z>0: Xt+1j = sign (\u03b8j \u00b7Xt \u2212 tj). This model therefore falls into the 1-bit compressed sensing framework (Boufounos & Baraniuk, 2008). Several recent papers study the theoretical guarantees obtained for 1-bit compressed sensing with specific measurements (Gupta et al., 2010; Plan & Vershynin, 2014). Whilst they obtained bounds of the order O(s log ms ), no current theory exists for recovering positive bounded signals from binary measurememts.

Running Time Analysis", "text": "We include here a running time analysis of our algorithm. In Figure 3, we compared our algorithm to the benchmark algorithms for increasing values of the number of nodes. In Figure 4, we compared our algorithm to the benchmarks for a fixed graph but for increasing number of observed cascades.\nIn both Figures, unsurprisingly, the simple greedy algorithm is the fastest. Even though both the MLE algorithm\nand the algorithm we introduced are based on convex optimization, the MLE algorithm is faster. This is due to the overhead caused by the `1-regularisation in (2).\nThe dependency of the running time on the number of cascades increases is linear, as expected. The slope is largest for our algorithm, which is again caused by the overhead induced by the `1-regularization."}], "references": [{"title": "Trace complexity of network inference", "author": ["Abrahao", "Bruno D", "Chierichetti", "Flavio", "Kleinberg", "Robert", "Panconesi", "Alessandro"], "venue": "In The 19th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,", "citeRegEx": "Abrahao et al\\.,? \\Q2013\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Abrahao et al\\.", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Tracking information epidemics in blogspace", "author": ["Adar", "Eytan", "Adamic", "Lada A"], "venue": "IEEE / WIC / ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI 2005),", "citeRegEx": "Adar et al\\.,? \\Q2005\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Adar et al\\.", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Statistical mechanics of complex networks", "author": ["Albert", "R\u00e9ka", "Barab\u00e1si", "Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3"], "venue": "CoRR, condmat/0106096,", "citeRegEx": "Albert et al\\.,? \\Q2001\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Albert et al\\.", "year": 2001}, {"title": "Lower bounds for sparse recovery", "author": ["Ba", "Khanh Do", "Indyk", "Piotr", "Price", "Eric", "Woodruff", "David P"], "venue": "CoRR, abs/1106.0365,", "citeRegEx": "Ba et al\\.,? \\Q2011\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Ba et al\\.", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Simultaneous analysis of lasso and dantzig selector", "author": ["Bickel", "Peter J", "Ritov", "Ya\u2019acov", "Tsybakov", "Alexandre B"], "venue": "The Annals of Statistics,", "citeRegEx": "Bickel et al\\.,? \\Q2009\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bickel et al\\.", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Simultaneous analysis of lasso and dantzig selector", "author": ["Bickel", "Peter J", "Ritov", "Ya\u2019acov", "Tsybakov", "Alexandre B"], "venue": "Ann.
