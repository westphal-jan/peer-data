Introduction", "text": "Input media for automatic summarization has varied from text [18, 5] to speech [21, 39, 34] and video [1], but the application domain has been, in general, restricted to informative sources: news [2, 30, 33, 11], meetings [26, 8], or lectures [7]. Nevertheless, application areas within the entertainment industry are gaining attention: e.g. summarization of literary short stories [12], music summarization [31], summarization of books [24], or inclusion of character analyses in movie summaries [36]. We follow this direction, creating extractive, text-driven video summaries for films and documentaries.\nDocumentaries started as cinematic portrayals of reality [10]. Today, they continue to portray historical events, argumentation, and research. They are commonly understood as capturing reality and therefore, seen as inherently non-fictional. Films, in contrast, are usually associated with fiction. However, films and documentaries do not fundamentally differ: many of the strategies and narrative structures employed in films are also used in documentaries [27].\nIn the context of our work, films (fictional) tell stories based on fictive events, whereas documentaries (non-fictional) address, mostly, scientific subjects. We study the parallelism between the information carried in subtitles and scripts of both films and documentaries.

Our main goal is to understand the quality of automatic summaries, produced for films and documentaries, using the well-known behavior of news articles as reference. Generated summaries are evaluated against manual abstracts using ROUGE metrics, which correlate with human judgements [15, 17].\nThis article is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the summarization algorithms; Section 3 presents the collected datasets; Section 4 presents the evaluation setup; Section 5 discusses our results; Section 6 presents conclusions and directions for future work."}, {"heading": "2.

In contrast with news articles and documentaries, three types of input were considered: script, subtitles, script+subtitles.\nFor each documentary, a summary was generated with the same average number of sentences of its manual plot summaries (\u2248 1% of the documentary\u2019s size).\nContent quality of summaries is based on word overlap (as defined by ROUGE) between generated summaries and their references. ROUGE-N computes the fraction of selected words that are correctly identified by the summarization algorithms (cf. Equation 5: RS are reference summaries, gramn is the ngram length, and countmatch(gramn) is the maximum number of n-grams of a candidate summary that co-occur with a set of reference summaries). ROUGE-SU measures the overlap of skip-bigrams (any pair of words in their sentence order, with the addition of unigrams as counting unit).

Films", "text": "Table 7 presents the scores for the film data combinations against plot summaries. Overall, Support Sets, LSA, and LexRank, capture the most relevant sentences for plot summaries. It would be expected, for algorithms such as GRASSHOPPER and MMR, that maximize diversity, to perform well in this context, because plot summaries are relatively small and focus on the more important aspects of the film, ideally, without redundant content. However, our results show otherwise. For scripts, LSA and LexRank are the best approaches in terms of R-1 and R-SU4.\nTable 8 presents the scores for the film data combinations against plot synopses. The size of synopses is very different from that of plot summaries. Although synopses also focus on the major events of the story, their larger size allows for a more refined description of film events. Additionally, because summaries are created with the same number of sentences of the corresponding synopsis, higher scores are expected. From all algorithms, LexRank clearly stands out with the highest scores for all metrics (except for R-SU4, for scripts).\n5 The script+subtitles combination was used in order to determine whether the inclusion of redundant content would improve the scores, over the separate use of scripts or subtitles. However, in all cases (Figure 4), script+subtitles leads to worse scores, when compared to scripts alone. The same behavior is observed when using subtitles except for Support Sets-based methods (Support Sets and KP-Centrality). For plot synopses, the best scores are achieved by LexRank and GRASSHOPPER, while, for plot summaries, the best scores are achieved by LexRank and LSA. By inspection of the summaries produced by each algorithm, we observed that MMR chooses sentences with fewer words in comparison with all other algorithms (normally, leading to lower scores). Overall, the algorithms behave similarly for both subtitles and scripts."}, {"heading": "5.3. Documentaries", "text": "From all algorithms (Table 9), LSA achieved the best results for R-1 and R-SU4, along with LexRank for R-1. KP-Centrality achieved the best results for R-2. It is important to notice that LSA also produces the summaries with the highest word count (favoring recall). Figure 2 shows the relative performance results: LSA outperformed all other algorithms for R-1 and RSU4, and KP-Centrality was the best for R-2; Support Sets and KP-Centrality performed closely to LSA for R-SU4; the best MMR results were consistently worse across all metrics (MMR summaries have the lowest word count)."}, {"heading": "5.4. Discussion", "text": "News articles intend to answer basic questions about a particular event: who, what, when, where, why, and often, how. Their structure is sometimes referred to as \u201cinverted pyramid\u201d, where the most essential information comes first. Typically, the first sentences provide a good overview of the entire article and are more likely to be chosen when composing the final summary. Although documentaries follow a narrative structure similar to films, they can be seen as more closely related to news than films, especially regarding their intrinsic informative nature. In spite of their different natures, however, summaries created by humans produce similar scores for all of them. It is possible to observe this behavior in Figure 3. Note that documentaries achieve higher scores than news articles or films, when using the original subtitles documents against the corresponding manual plot summaries.\nFigure 4 presents an overview of the performance of each summarization algorithm across all domains. The results concerning news articles were the best out of all three datasets for all experiments. However, summaries for this dataset preserve, approximately, 31% of the original articles, in terms of sentences, which is significantly higher than for films and documentaries (which preserve less than 1%), necessarily leading to higher scores. Nonetheless, we can observe the differences in behavior between these domains. Notably, documentaries achieve the best results for plot summaries, in comparison with films, using scripts, subtitles, or the combination of both. The relative scores on the films dataset are influenced by two major aspects: the short sentences found in the films dialogs; and, since the generated summaries are extracts from subtitles and scripts, they are not able to represent the film as a whole, in contrast with what happens with plot summaries or synopses. Additionally, the experiments conducted for script+subtitles for films, in general, do not improve scores above those of scripts alone, except for Support Sets for R-1. Overall, LSA performed consistently better for news articles and documentaries. Similar relatively good behavior had already been observed for meeting\n6 recordings, where the best summarizer was also LSA [26]. One possible reason for these results is that LSA tries to capture the relation between words in sentences. By inferring contextual usage of text based on these relations, high scores, apart from R-1, are produced for R-2 and R-SU4. For films, LexRank was the best performing algorithm for subtitles, scripts and the combination of both, using plot synopses, followed by LSA and Support Sets for plot summaries. MMR has the lowest scores for all metrics and all datasets. We observed that sentences closer to the centroid typically contain very few words, thus leading to shorter summaries and the corresponding low scores.\nInterestingly, by observing the average of R-1, R-2, and RSU4, it is possible to notice that it follows very closely the values of R-SU4. These results suggest that R-SU4 adequately reflects the scores of both R-1 and R-2, capturing the concepts derived from both unigrams and bigrams.\nOverall, considering plot summaries, documentaries achieved higher results in comparison with films. However, in general, the highest score for these two domains is achieved using films scripts against plot synopses. Note that synopses have a significant difference in terms of sentences in comparison with plot summaries. The average synopsis has 120 sentences, while plot summaries have, on average, 5 sentences for films, and 4 for documentaries. This gives synopses a clear advantage in terms of ROUGE (recall-based) scores, due to the high count of words."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "We analyzed the impact of the six summarization algorithms on three datasets. The newspaper articles dataset was used as a reference. The other two datasets, consisting of films and documentaries, were evaluated against plot summaries, for films and documentaries, and synopses, for films. Despite the different nature of these domains, the abstractive summaries created by humans, used for evaluation, share similar scores across metrics.\nThe best performing algorithms are LSA, for news and documentaries, and LexRank for films. Moreover, we conducted experiments combining scripts and subtitles for films, in order to assess the performance of generic algorithms by inclusion of redundant content. Our results suggest that this combination is unfavorable. Additionally, it is possible to observe that all algorithms behave similarly for both subtitles and scripts. As previously mentioned, the average of the scores follows closely the values of R-SU4, suggesting that R-SU4 is able to capture concepts derived from both unigrams and bigrams.\nWe plan to use subtitles as a starting point to perform video summaries of films and documentaries. For films, the results from our experiments using plot summaries show that the summarization of scripts only marginally improved performance, in comparison with subtitles. This suggests that subtitles are a viable approach for text-driven film and documentary summarization. This positive aspect is compounded by their being broadly available, as opposed to scripts."}, {"heading": "7.

We use three datasets: (i) news articles, (ii) film scripts and subtitles, and (iii) documentary subtitles. Standard ROUGE metrics are used for comparing generated summaries against news abstracts, plot summaries, and synopses. We show that the best performing algorithms are LSA, for news articles and documentaries, and LexRank and Support Sets, for films. Despite the different nature of films and documentaries, their relative behavior is in accordance with that obtained for news articles. c \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
