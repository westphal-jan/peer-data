In the past few years, an influx of new, large vision & language corpora, alongside dramatic advances in vision research, has sparked renewed interest in connecting vision and language. Vision & language corpora now provide alignments between visual content that can be recognized with Computer Vision (CV) algorithms and language that can be understood and generated using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.\nFueled in part by the newly emerging data, research that blends techniques in vision and in language has increased at an incredible rate. In just\n\u2217F.F. and N.M. contributed equally to this work.\nthe past year, recent work has proposed methods for image and video captioning (Fang et al., 2014; Donahue et al., 2014; Venugopalan et al., 2015), summarization (Kim et al., 2015), reference (Kazemzadeh et al., 2014), and question answering (Antol et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2015), to name just a few. The newly crafted large-scale vision & language datasets have played a crucial role in defining this research, serving as a foundation for training/testing and helping to set benchmarks for measuring system performance.\nCrowdsourcing and large image collections such as those provided by Flickr1 have made it possible for researchers to propose new algorithms alongside an accompanying dataset. As more and more datasets have emerged in this space, it has become unclear how different methods generalize beyond the datasets they are evaluated on, and which datasets may be most useful for moving the field towards solving larger AI problems.\nIn this paper, we take a step back to document this moment in time, making a record of the major available corpora that are driving the field. We propose a set of criteria for analyzing and evaluating the quality of vision & language datasets. We categorize the available datasets into three major categories and evaluate them against this critera. As a supplement to this paper, we provide an evolving website2 with visualizations and links to more vision & language tasks and datasets."}, {"heading": "2 Quality Criteria for Language & Vision Datasets", "text": "The quality of a dataset is highly dependent on the sampling and scraping techniques used early in the data collection process. However, the content of datasets can play a major role in narrowing the focus of the field. Datasets are affected by both\n1 http://www.flickr.com 2http://visiontolanguageteam.github.\nio/Vision-To-Language-Survey/\nar X\niv :1\n50 6.\n06 83\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n3 Ju\nn 20\n15\nreporting bias (Gordon and Durme, 2013), where the frequency with which people write about actions, events, or states does not directly reflect real-world frequencies of those phenomena; they are also affected by photographer\u2019s bias (Torralba and Efros, 2011), where photographs are somewhat predictable within a given domain. This suggests that new datasets may be useful towards the larger AI goal if provided alongside a set of quantitative metrics that show how they compare against similar corpora, as well as more general \u201cbackground\u201d corpora. Such metrics can be used as indicators of dataset bias and language richness. At a higher level, we argue that clearly defined metrics are necessary to provide quantitative measurements of how a new dataset compares to previous work. This helps clarify and benchmark how research is progressing towards a broader AI goal as more and more data comes into play.\nIn this section, we propose a set of such metrics that help characterize disparate vision & language datasets. We focus on methods to measure language quality that can be used across several corpora. We also briefly examine metrics for vision quality. We evaluate several recent datasets based on all proposed metrics in Section 4, with results reported in Tables 1, 2, and Figure 1.\nLanguage Quality We define the following language quality criteria for evaluating the caption or instructions of the datasets: \u2022 Vocabulary Size (#vocab), the number of unique vocabulary words. \u2022 Syntactic Complexity (Frazier, Yngve) measures the amount of embedding/branching in a sentence\u2019s syntax. We use both Yngve (Yngve, 1960) and Frazier metrics (Frazier, 1985). \u2022 Part of Speech Distribution measures the distribution over nouns, verbs, adjective, and other parts of speech. \u2022 Abstract:Concrete Ratio (#Conc, #Abs, %Abs) indicates the range of visual and non-visual concepts the dataset covers. Abstract terms are ideas or concepts, such as \u2018love\u2019 or \u2018think\u2019 and concrete terms are all the objects or events that are mainly available to the senses. For this purpose, we use a list of most common abstract terms in English (Vanderwende et al., 2005), and define concrete terms as all other words except for a small set of function words. \u2022 Average Sentence Length (Sent Len.) shows how rich and descriptive the sentences are.\n\u2022 Perplexity provides a measure of data skew by measuring how expected sentences are from one corpus according to a model trained on another corpus. We analyze perplexity (Ppl) for each dataset against a 5-gram language model learned on a generic 30B words English dataset. We further analyze pair-wise perplexity of datasets against each other in Section 4.\nVision Quality Our focus in this survey is mainly on language, however, the characteristics of images or videos and their corresponding annotations is as important in vision & language research. The quality of vision in a dataset can be characterized in part by the variety of visual subjects and scenes provided, as well as the richness of the annotations (e.g., segmentation using bounding boxes (BB) or visual dependencies between boxes). Moreover, a vision corpus can use abstract or real images (Abs/Real)."}, {"heading": "3 The Available Datasets", "text": "We group a representative set of available datasets based on their content. For a complete list of datasets and their descriptions, please refer to the supplementary website.2"}, {"heading": "3.1 Captioned Images", "text": "Several recent vision & language datasets provide one or multiple captions per image. The captions of these datasets are either the original photo title and descriptions provided by online users (Ordonez et al., 2011; Thomee et al., 2015), or the captions generated by crowd workers for existing images (Yatskar et al., 2014). The former datasets tend to be larger in size and contain more contextual descriptions."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 User-generated Captions", "text": "\u2022 De\u0301ja\u0300 Images Dataset (Chen et al., 2015) consists of 180K unique user-generated captions associated with about 4M Flickr images, where one caption is aligned with multiple images. Collected by querying Flickr for 693 high frequency nouns, then further filtered to have at least one verb and be judged as \u201cgood\u201d captions by Turkers."}, {"heading": "3.1.2 Crowd-sourced Captions", "text": "\u2022 Flickr 30K Images (Young et al., 2014) extends previous Flickr datasets (Rashtchian et al., 2010), and includes 158,915 crowd-sourced captions that describe 31,783 images of people involved in everyday activities and events.\n\u2022Microsoft COCO Dataset (MS COCO) (Lin et al., 2014) includes complex everyday scenes with common objects in naturally occurring contexts. Objects in the scene are labeled using per-instance segmentations. In total, this dataset contains photos of 91 basic object type with 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, each paired with 5 captions. This dataset gave rise to the CVPR 2015 image captioning challenge and is continuing to be a benchmark for comparing various aspects of vision and language research. \u2022 Abstract Scenes Dataset (Clipart) (Zitnick et al., 2013) was created with the goal of representing real-world scenes with clipart to study scene semantics isolated from object recognition and segmentation issues in image processing. This removes the burden of low-level vision tasks. This dataset contains 10,020 images of children playing outdoors associated with total 60,396 descriptions."}, {"heading": "3.2 Video Description and Instruction", "text": "Video datasets aligned with descriptions (Chen et al., 2010; Rohrbach et al., 2012; Regneri et al., 2013; Naim et al., 2015; Malmaud et al., 2015) generally represent limited domains and small lexicons, which is due to the fact that video processing and understanding is a very compute-intensive task. Available datasets include: \u2022 Short Videos Described with Sentences (Yu and Siskind, 2013) includes 61 video clips (each 35 seconds in length, filmed in three different outdoor environments), showing multiple simultaneous events between a subset of four objects: a person, a backpack, a chair, and a trash-can. Each video was manually annotated (with very restricted grammar and lexicon) with several sentences describing what occurs in the video. \u2022 Microsoft Research Video Description Corpus (MS VDC) (Chen and Dolan, 2011) contains parallel descriptions (85,550 English ones)\nof 2,089 short video snippets (10-25 seconds long). The descriptions are one sentence summaries about the actions or events in the video as described by Amazon Turkers. In this dataset, both paraphrase and bilingual alternatives are captured, hence, the dataset can be useful translation, paraphrasing, and video description purposes."}, {"heading": "3.3 Beyond Visual Description", "text": "Recent work has demonstrated that n-gram language modeling paired with scene-level understanding of an image trained on large enough datasets can result in reasonable automatically generated captions (Fang et al., 2014; Donahue et al., 2014). Some works have proposed to step beyond description generation, towards deeper AI tasks such as question answering (Ren et al., 2015; Malinowski and Fritz, 2014). We present two of these attempts below: \u2022 Visual Madlibs Dataset (VML) (Yu et al., 2015) is a subset of 10,783 images from the MS COCO dataset which aims to go beyond describing which objects are in the image. For a given image, three Amazon Turkers were prompted to complete one of 12 fill-in-the-blank template questions, such as \u2018when I look at this picture, I feel \u2013\u2019, selected automatically based on the image content. This dataset contains a total of 360,001 MadLib question and answers. \u2022 Visual Question Answering (VQA) Dataset (Antol et al., 2015) is created for the task of openended VQA, where a system can be presented with an image and a free-form natural-language question (e.g., \u2018how many people are in the photo?\u2019), and should be able to answer the question. This dataset contains both real images and abstract scenes, paired with questions and answers. Real images include 123,285 images from MS COCO dataset, and 10,000 clip-art abstract scenes, made up from 20 \u2018paperdoll\u2019 human models with ad-\njustable limbs and over 100 objects and 31 animals. Amazon Turkers were prompted to create \u2018interesting\u2019 questions, resulting in 215,150 questions and 430,920 answers. \u2022 Toronto COCO-QA Dataset (CQA) (Ren et al., 2015) is also a visual question answering dataset, where the questions are automatically generated from image captions of MS COCO dataset. This dataset has a total of 123,287 images with 117,684 questions with one-word answer about objects, numbers, colors, or locations."}, {"heading": "4 Analysis", "text": "We analyze the datasets introduced in Section 3 according to the metrics defined in Section 2. We find evidence that the VQA dataset captures more abstract concepts than other datasets, with almost 20% of the words found in our abstract concept resource. The Deja corpus has the least amount of abstract concepts, followed by COCO and VDC. This reflects some of the differences in collecting the various corpora: For example, the Deja corpus was collected to find specifically visual phrases that can be used to describe multiple images. This corpus also has the most syntactically simple phrases, as measured by both Frazier and Yngve; this is likely caused by the phrases needing to be general enough to capture multiple images.\nThe most syntactically complex sentences are found in the Flickr30K, COCO and CQA datasets.\nHowever, the CQA dataset suffers from a high perplexity against a background corpus relative to the other datasets, at odds with relatively short sentence lengths. This suggests that the automatic caption-to-question conversion may be creating unexpectedly complex sentences that are less reflective of general language usage. In contrast, the COCO and Flickr30K dataset\u2019s relatively high syntactic complexity is in line with their relatively high sentence length.\nTable 2 illustrates further similarities between datasets, and a more fine-grained use of perplexity to measure the usefulness of a given training set for predicting words of a given test set. Some datasets such as COCO, Flickr30K, and Clipart are generally more useful as out-domain data compared to the QA datasets. Test sets for VQA and CQA are quite idiosyncratic and yield poor perplexity unless trained on in-domain data.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the COCO dataset is balanced across POS tags most similarly to the balanced Brown corpus (Marcus et al., 1999). The Clipart dataset provides the highest proportion of verbs, which often correspond to actions/poses in vision research, while the Flickr30K corpus provides the most nouns, which often correspond to object/stuff categories in vision research."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We detail the recent outgrowth of vision & language corpora and compare and contrast several recently released large datasets. We argue that a newly introduced corpus may measure how they compare to similar datasets by measuring perplexity, syntactic complexity, abstract:concrete word ratios, among other metrics. By leveraging such metrics and comparing across corpora, research can narrow in on how datasets are biased or skewed in different directions, and define new cor-\npora accordingly."}], "references": [{"title": "VQA: visual question answering", "author": ["Stanislaw Antol", "Aishwarya Agrawal", "Jiasen Lu", "Margaret Mitchell", "Dhruv Batra", "C.
