This is however not the case with general-sum stochastic games. A fairly general optimization problem formulation is available for general-sum stochastic games by Filar and Vrieze [2004]. However, the optimization problem there has a non-linear objective and non-linear constraints with special structure. Since gradients of both the objective as well as constraints of this optimization problem are well defined, gradient based schemes seem to be a natural choice. We discuss a gradient scheme tuned for two-player stochastic games. We show in simulations that this scheme indeed converges to a Nash equilibrium, for a simple terrain exploration problem modelled as a general-sum stochastic game. However, it turns out that only global minima of the optimization problem correspond to Nash equilibria of the underlying general-sum stochastic game, while gradient schemes only guarantee convergence to local minima. We then provide important necessary conditions for gradient schemes to converge to Nash equilibria in general-sum stochastic games.\nKeywords: Game theory, Nonlinear programming, Non-convex constrained problems, Discounted cost criteria, General-sum stochastic games, Nash equilibrium."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Game theory is seen as a useful means to handle multi-agent scenarios. Since the seminal work of Shapley [1953], stochastic games have been an important class of models for multi-agent systems. A comprehensive treatment of stochastic games under various payoff criteria is given by Filar and Vrieze [2004]. Many interesting problems like fishery games, advertisement games, etc., can be modelled as stochastic games, see Filar and Vrieze [2004]. One of the significant results is that every stochastic game has a Nash equilibrium and it can be characterised in terms of global minima of a suitable mathematical programming problem.\nAs an application of general-sum games to the multi-agent scenario, Singh et al. [2000] observed that in a two-agent iterated general-sum game, Nash convergence is assured either in strategies or in the very least in average payoffs. Later by Hu and Wellman [1999], stochastic game theory was observed to be a better framework for multi-agent scenarios as it could be viewed as an extension of the well studied Markov decision theory (see Bertsekas [1995]). However, in the stochastic game setting, general-sum games are difficult to solve as, unlike\n\u2217hlprasu@csa.iisc.ernet.in \u2020shalabh@csa.iisc.ernet.in\nzero-sum games, they cannot be cast in the framework similar to Markov decision processes. Hu and Wellman [1999] proposed an interesting Q-learning algorithm, that is based on reinforcement learning (see Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis [1996]). However, their algorithm assures convergence only if the game has exactly one Nash equilibrium. An extension to the above algorithm called NashQ was proposed by Hu and Wellman [2003] which showed improvement in performance. However, convergence in a scenario with multiple Nash equilibria was not addressed. Another noteworthy work is of Littman [2001] who proposed a friend-or-foe Q-learning (FFQ) algorithm as an improvement over the NashQ algorithm with assured convergence, though not necessarily to a Nash equilibrium. Moreover, the FFQ algorithm is applicable to a restricted class of games where either full co-operation between agents is ensured or the game is zero-sum. Algorithms for some specific cases of stochastic games such as Additive Reward and Additive Transition (AR-AT) games are discussed by Filar and Vrieze [2004] as well as Breton et al. [1986].\nA new type of approach based on homotopy is proposed by Herings and Peeters [2004]. In this approach, a homotopic path between equilibrium points of N independent MDPs and the N -player stochastic game in question, is traced numerically giving a Nash equilibrium point of the stochastic game of interest. Their result applies to both normal form as well as extensive form games. However, this approach has a complexity similar to that of typical gradient descent schemes discussed in this paper. For more recent developments in this direction, see the work by Herings and Peeters [2006] and Borkovsky et al. [2010].\nA recent approach for the computation of Nash equilibria is given by Akchurina [2009] in which a reinforcement learning type scheme is proposed. Though their experiments do show convergence in a large group of randomly generated games, a formal proof of convergence has not been provided.\nFor general-sum stochastic games, [Breton et al., 1986, Section 4.3] provides an interesting optimization problem with non-linear objectives and linear constraints whose global minima correspond to Nash equilibria of the underlying general-sum stochastic game. However, since the objective is not guaranteed to be convex, simple gradient descent techniques might not converge to a global minimum. Mac Dermed and Isbell [2009] formulate intermediate optimization problems, called Multi-Objective Linear Programs (MOLPs), to compute Nash equilibria as well as Pareto optimal solutions. However, as mentioned in that paper, the complexity of their algorithm scales exponentially with the problem size. Thus, their algorithm is tractable only for small sized problems with a few tens of states.\nAnother non-linear optimization problem for computing Nash equilibria in general-sum stochastic games has been given by Filar and Vrieze [2004]. We begin with this optimization problem by discussing it in Section 2. Gradient based techniques are quite common for solving optimization problems. In the optimization problem, gradients of (both) the objective and all constraints w.r.t. the value vector v and strategy vector \u03c0, are well defined. A possible solution approach is to apply simple gradient based techniques to solve these optimization problems. We look at a possible gradient descent scheme in Section 3. In the process of construction of this scheme, several initial hurdles for gradient descent schemes are discussed and addressed. We then consider an example problem of terrain exploration, modelled as a general-sum stochastic game, in Section 4. In the same section, we show via simulation that the gradient descent scheme of Section 3 does indeed give a Nash equilibrium solution to the terrain exploration problem. In our case, the optimization problem at hand has only global minima correspond to Nash equilibria of the underlying general-sum stochastic game as discussed later in Section 2.4. It is well known that gradient descent schemes can only guarantee convergence to local minima. But, in the optimization problems that we consider, global minima are desired. So, a question remains: Are simple gradient descent schemes good enough to give Nash equilibria in the aforementioned optimization problems? In other words, are there only global minimum points in these optimization problems, so that simple gradient descent schemes can easily work? We\naddress this issue in Section 5. Finally, in Section 6 we provide the concluding remarks."}, {"heading": "2 The Optimization Problem", "text": "The framework of a general-sum stochastic game is described in Section 2.1. A basic idea of the optimization problem is given in Section 2.2. The full optimization problem is then formulated in Section 2.3 for the infinite horizon discounted reward setting. Some important results by Filar and Vrieze [2004] that are applicable here are then described."}, {"heading": "2.1 Stochastic Games", "text": "A two-agent scenario is considered in the following formulation. One can in general consider an N -agent scenario for N \u2265 2. We assume N = 2 only for notational simplicity. We interchangeably use the terms \u2018agent\u2019 and \u2018player\u2019 to mean the same entity in the description below. We assume that the stochastic game terminates in a finite but random time. Hence, a discounted value framework in dynamic programming has been chosen for the optimization problem.\nA stochastic game is described via a tuple < S,A, p, r >. The quantities in the tuple are explained through the description below. (i) S denotes the state space. (ii) Ai(x) denotes the action space for the ith agent, i = 1, 2. A(x) =\n2 \u00d7 i=1\nAi(x), the Cartesian product, is the aggregate action space consisting of all possible actions of both agents when the state of the game is x \u2208 S. (iii) p(y|x, a) denotes the probability of going from the state x \u2208 S at the current instant to y \u2208 S at the immediate next instant when the action a \u2208 A(x) is chosen. (iv) Finally, r(x, a) denotes the vector of reward functions of both agents when the state is x \u2208 S and the vector of actions a \u2208 A(x) is chosen.\nFor an infinite horizon discounted reward setting, a discount factor 0 < \u03b2 < 1 is also included in the tuple describing the game. As is clear from this definition, a stochastic game can be viewed as an extension of the single-agent Markov decision process.\nA strategy \u03c0i \u25b3 = \u2329 \u03c0i1, \u03c0 i 2, . . . , \u03c0 i t, . . . \u232a of the ith player in a stochastic game prescribes the action to be performed in each state at each time instant t, by that player. We denote by \u03c0it(\u00b7) the action prescribed for the ith agent by the strategy \u03c0it at time instant t. The quantity \u2018\u00b7\u2019 in \u03c0it(\u00b7), in general, corresponds to the entire history of states and actions of all agents up to the (t \u2212 1)st instant and the current system state at the tth instant. Let the set of all possible strategies for the ith player be denoted by F i. A strategy \u03c0i of player i, is said to be a Markov strategy if \u03c0it depends only on the current state xt \u2208 S at time t. Thus, for a Markov strategy \u03c0i of player i, \u03c0it(x) \u2208 Ai(x), \u2200t \u2265 0, x \u2208 S, i = 1, 2. If the action chosen in any state for a Markov strategy \u03c0i is independent of the time instant t, viz., \u03c0it \u2261 \u03c0\u0304i, \u2200t \u2265 0, i = 1, 2, for some \u03c0\u0304 such that \u03c0\u0304i(x) \u2208 Ai(x), \u2200x \u2208 S, then the strategy is said be stationary. Henceforth, we shall restrict our attention to stationary strategies only. By abuse of notation, we denote by \u03c0 itself the stationary strategy. Extending this to all players, we denote a Markov strategy-tuple by \u03c0 \u25b3 = \u2329 \u03c01, \u03c02 \u232a\nLet\u2206(A(x)) (resp. \u2206(Ai(x))) denote the set of all probability measures onA(x) (resp. Ai(x)). A randomized Markov strategy is specified via the sequence of maps \u03c6it : S \u2192 \u2206(Ai(x)), x \u2208 S, t \u2265 0, i = 1, 2. Thus, \u03c6it(x) is a distribution on the set of actions Ai(x) and in general depends on time instant t. We say that \u03c6it is a stationary\nrandomized strategy or simply a randomized strategy for player i if \u03c6it \u2261 \u03c6i. By an abuse of notation, we denote by \u03c0 = \u2329 \u03c01, \u03c02 \u232a , a stationary randomized strategy-tuple that we also (many times) call a strategy, since from now on, we shall only work with randomized strategies. We use \u03c0i(x, a) to denote the probability of picking action a \u2208 Ai(x) in state x \u2208 S by agent i. [Filar and Vrieze, 2004, Theorem 3.8.1, pp. 130] states that a Nash equilibrium in stationary randomized strategies exists for general-sum discounted stochastic games. We will refer to such stationary randomized strategies as Nash strategies. Similar to MDPs [Bertsekas, 1995], one can define the value function as follows:\nvi\u03c0(x0) = E\n  \u2211\nt\n\u03b2t \u2211\na\u2208A(x)\n( ri(xt, a) 2\u220f\ni=1\n\u03c0i(xt, a) )  , \u2200i = 1, 2. (1)\nLet \u03c0\u2212i represent the strategy of the agent other than the ith agent, that is, \u03c0\u22121 = \u03c02 and \u03c0\u22122 = \u03c01 respectively. Formally, we define Nash strategies and Nash equilibrium below. Definition 1 (Nash Equilibrium) A stationary Markov strategy \u03c0\u2217 = \u2329 \u03c01\u2217, \u03c02\u2217 \u232a is said to be Nash if\nvi\u03c0\u2217(x) \u2265 vi\u3008\u03c0i,\u03c0\u2212i\u2217\u3009(x), \u2200\u03c0i, i = 1, 2, \u2200x \u2208 S.\nThe corresponding equilibrium of the game is said to be a Nash equilibrium.\nLike in normal-form games [Nash, 1950], pure strategy Nash equilibria may not exist in the case of stochastic games. Using dynamic programming, the Nash equilibrium condition can be written as:\nvi(x) = max \u03c0i(x)\u2208\u2206(Ai(x))   E\u03c0(x)  ri(x, a) + \u03b2 \u2211\ny\u2208U(x)\np(y|x, a)vi(y)      , \u2200i = 1, 2. (2)\nUnlike MDPs, (2) involves two maximization equations. Note that the two equations are coupled because the reward of one agent is influenced by the strategy of the other agent and so is the state transition."}, {"heading": "2.2 The Basic Formulation", "text": "The dynamic programming equation (2) for finding optimal values can now be revised to:\nvi(x) = max \u03c0i(x)\u2208\u2206(Ai(x))\n{ E\u03c0i(x)Q i(x, ai) } , \u2200x \u2208 S, \u2200i = 1, 2, (3)\nwhere\nQi(x, ai) = E\u03c0\u2212i(x)\n ri(x, a) + \u03b2 \u2211\ny\u2208U(x)\np(y|x, a)vi(y)   ,\nrepresents the marginal value associated with picking action ai \u2208 Ai(x), in state x \u2208 S for agent i. Also, \u2206(Ai(x)) denotes the set of all possible probability distributions over Ai(x). We derive a possible optimization problem from (3) in Section 2.2.1 followed by a discussion of possible constraints on the feasible solutions in Section 2.2.2."}, {"heading": "2.2.1 The objective", "text": "Equation (3) says that vi(x) represents the maximum value of E\u03c0iQi(x, ai) over all possible convex combinations of policy of agent i, \u03c0i \u2208 \u2206(Ai(x)). However, neither the optimal value vi(x) nor the optimal policy \u03c0i are known apriori. So, a possible optimization objective would be\nf i(vi, \u03c0i) = \u2211\nx\u2208S\n( vi(x)\u2212 E\u03c0iQi(x, ai) ) ,\nwhich will have to be minimized over all possible policies \u03c0i \u2208 \u2206(Ai(x)). But Qi(x, ai), by definition, is dependent on strategies of all other agents. So, an isolated minimization of f i(vi, \u03c0i) would really not make sense. Rather we need to consider the aggregate objective,\nf(v, \u03c0) =\n2\u2211\ni=1\nf i(vi, \u03c0i),\nwhich is minimized over all possible policies \u03c0i \u2208 \u2206(Ai(x)), i = 1, 2. Thus, we have an optimization problem with objective as f(v, \u03c0) along with natural constraints ensuring that the policy vectors \u03c0i(x) remain as probabilities over all possible actions Ai(x) for all states x \u2208 S for both agents. Formally, we write this optimization problem as below:\nmin v,\u03c0\nf(v, \u03c0) = 2\u2211\ni=1 \u2211 x\u2208S ( vi(x) \u2212 E\u03c0iQi(x, ai) ) s.t.\n(a)\u03c0i(x, ai) \u2265 0, \u2200ai \u2208 Ai(x), x \u2208 S, i = 1, 2, (b) 2\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c0i(x, ai) = 1, \u2200x \u2208 S, i = 1, 2.\n  \n(4)\nIntuitively, all those (v, \u03c0) pairs which make f(v, \u03c0) as zero with \u03c0 satisfying (4(a))-(4(b)), should correspond to Nash equilibria of the corresponding general-sum discounted stochastic game. The question is: Is this true? We address this question in two parts. First, if \u03c0\u2217 represents a Nash strategy-tuple with v\u2217 as the corresponding dynamic programming value obtained from (2), then we answer the question whether f(v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217) is zero? Second, if (v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217) is such that (4(a))-(4(b)) are satisfied and f(v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217) is zero, then whether \u03c0\u2217 is a Nash strategy-tuple? We address these two questions in Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2.\nLemma 2.1 Let (v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217) represent a possible solution for the dynamic programming equation (2). Then, (v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217) is a feasible solution of the optimization problem (4) and f(v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217) = 0.\nProof: Proof follows simply from the construction of the optimization problem (4).\nLemma 2.2 Let (v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217) be a feasible solution of the optimization problem (4) such that f(v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217) = 0. Then, \u03c0\u2217 need not be Nash strategy-tuple and v\u2217 need not correspond to the dynamic programming value obtained from (2).\nProof: We provide a proof by example. Choose a \u03c0\u2217 such that it is not a Nash strategy-tuple. Then, to make f(v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217) = 0, we need to compute a v\u2217 such that\nvi\u2217(x) \u2212 E\u03c0i\u2217(x)Qi(x, ai) = 0, \u2200x \u2208 S, i = 1, 2. (5)\nLet Ri = \u2329 E\u03c0\u2217(x)r i(x, a) : x \u2208 S \u232a be a column vector over rewards to agent i in various states of the underlying game. Also, let P = [ E\u03c0\u2217(x)p(y|x, a) : x \u2208 S, y \u2208 S ] represent the state-transition matrix of the underlying Markov process. Then, (5) can be written in vector form as\nv i\u2217 \u2212 ( Ri + \u03b2Pvi\u2217 ) = 0, \u2200i = 1, 2. (6)\nSince P is a stochastic matrix, all its eigen-values are less than or equal to one. Thus, the matrix I \u2212 \u03b2P is invertible. So the system of equations (6) has a unique solution with\nv i\u2217 = (I \u2212 \u03b2P )\u22121 Ri, i = 1, 2.\nThus for any strategy-tuple \u03c0\u2217, which need not be Nash, there exists a corresponding v\u2217 such that f(v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217) = 0."}, {"heading": "2.2.2 Constraints", "text": "The basic optimization problem (4) has only a set of simple constraints ensuring that \u03c0 remains a valid strategy. As shown in lemma 2.2, this optimization problem is not sufficient to accurately represent Nash equilibria of the underlying general-sum discounted stochastic game. Here, we look at a possible set of additional constraints which might make the optimization problem more useful. Note that the term being maximized in equation (3), i.e., E\u03c0iQ i(x, ai), represents a convex combination of the values of Qi(x, ai) over all possible actions ai \u2208 Ai(x) in a given state x \u2208 S for a given agent i.

However, the previously posed question remains: Is this good enough to make f(v, \u03c0) = 0, for a feasible (v, \u03c0) to correspond to a Nash equilibrium?

(vii) P (y|x, a1,A2(x)) is the column in P (y|x) corresponding to the case when the first player picks action a1 \u2208 A1(x). As with ri(x, a1,A2(x)), each entry in the above column corresponds to an action of the second player.

The first set of inequality constraints (7(a)) on the first agent are quadratic in v1 and \u03c02 and the second set (7(b)) on the second agent are quadratic in v2 and \u03c01 respectively. However, in both cases, the quadratic terms are only cross products between the components of a value vector and a strategy vector.\nThe objective function is a non-negative cubic function of v and \u03c0. All the terms in the objective function consist of only cross terms. The cross terms between the value vector of an agent and the strategy vector of either agent are present in the term P (\u03c0)vi of the objective function and those between strategy vectors of the two agents are in the term ri(\u03c0).\nWe modify the constraints in the optimization problem (7) by eliminating all the equality constraints in it, as follows: One of the elements \u03c0i(x, ai), ai \u2208 Ai(x), in each of the equations 1Tmi(x)\u03c0i(x, ai) = 1 can be automatically set, thereby resulting in inequality constraints over the remaining components as below.

So, as the first naive way of handling this optimization problem, we see whether the same can be broken down into smaller problems via a uni-variate type scheme [Rao, 1996, Section 5.4, pp. 350]. It is possible to see that the original problem can be split into two sets of linear optimization problems with (i) the first set having two optimization problems in v1 and v2 separately. Here, \u03c0 is held constant; and, (ii) the second having one in\u2329 \u03c01(x), \u03c02(x) \u232a for every possible state x \u2208 S. In each of these cases, v is held constant. Thus, with a uni-variate type of break down of the original problem, we get several smaller problems that can be easily solved. However, a major drawback of this approach is the inherent deficiency of the uni-variate methods which do not have guaranteed convergence in general. In fact, we observed in simulations and also through numerical calculations that this approach does indeed fail because of the above mentioned deficiency. Hence, we look at devising a non-linear programming approach. The algorithm to be discussed is mainly based on an interior-point search algorithm by Herskovits [1986].\nWe first discuss the difficulties posed by the optimization problem (7). We try to address these issues in the subsequent sections by presenting a suitable gradient-based algorithm. With a suitable initial feasible point, the iterative procedure of Herskovits [1986] converges to a constrained local minimum of a given optimization problem. The unmodified algorithm of Herskovits [1986] is presented in Section 3.2. Section 3.3 discusses a\nscheme for finding an initial feasible point. Exploiting the knowledge about the functional forms of the objective and constraints, we present in Section 3.5 our modification in Herskovits algorithm to the procedure of selection of a suitable step length. And finally the modified algorithm in full, is provided in Section 3.6."}, {"heading": "3.1 Difficulties", "text": "We note that the optimization problem (7) presents the following difficulties.\n1. Dimensionality - The numbers of variables and constraints involved in the optimization problem are large.\nFor the two agent scenario, the number of variables can be shown to be twice the sum of the cardinalities of the state and action spaces. For instance, in the terrain exploration problem discussed in Section 4, for a simple 4 \u00d7 4 grid terrain with two agents and two objects, the number of variables is (647 \u00d7 2) + (4169 \u00d7 2) = 9632. The total number of inequality constraints for the same can also be computed to be (4169\u00d7 2) + (4169\u00d7 2) = 16676.\n2. Non-convexity - The constraint region in the optimization problem is not necessarily convex. In fact, during simulations related to the terrain exploration problem (Section 4), we observed that the condition does not\nhold for many constraints. So, in general, the optimization problem (7) has non-convex feasible region.\n3. Issue with steepest descent - As explained in Section 2.2, the objective function in the optimization problem (7) is obtained by averaging over strategies, the inequality constraint sets (7(a)) and (7(b)) respectively. This\nhas an effect on the steepest descent gradient directions at the constraint boundaries. The steepest descent direction has been found to be always opposing the constraint boundaries. As a result, a gradient method with the steepest descent direction as its search direction will get stuck when it hits a constraint boundary."}, {"heading": "3.2 The Herskovits Algorithm", "text": "We observed that in the optimization problem (7), steepest descent directions most often oppose the active constraint boundaries. Hence a steepest descent direction cannot be used as it would get stuck at one such boundary point which may not be an optimal point. Herskovits method offers two features which address this issue: (1) The search direction selected at each iteration, while being a strictly descent direction, makes use of the knowledge of the gradients of constraints as well as the gradient of the objective; and (2) the procedure is strictly feasible, i.e., at any iteration, the current best feasible point is not touching any constraint boundary.\nAssumptions: The assumptions required for the two-stage method are as follows:\n(i) The feasible region \u2126 has an interior \u2126o and is equal to the closure of \u2126o, i.e., \u2126 = \u2126\u0304o.\n(ii) Each \u3008v, \u03c0\u3009 \u2208 \u2126o, satisfies gi(v, \u03c0) < 0, i = 1, 2, . . . , n.\n(iii) There exists a real number a such that the level set \u2126a = {\u3008v, \u03c0\u3009 \u2208 \u2126|f(v, \u03c0) \u2264 a} is compact and has an interior.\n(iv) The function f is continuously differentiable and gj , j = 1, 2, . . . , n, is twice continuously differentiable in\n\u2126a.\n(v) At every \u3008v, \u03c0\u3009 \u2208 \u2126a, the gradients of active constraints form an independent set of vectors.\nIt can be seen that assumptions (i)-(iv) are easily verified considering the functional forms of the objective and constraints of the optimization problem (7) and that state space, S and action space, A, are assumed to be finite.

Let D(x, a1) = c1(x, a1)c1(x, a1) \u2212 4b1(x, a1)d1(x, a1). Consider the case where D < 0. This implies that the quadratic does not intersect the t-axis at any point i.e., it lies fully above the t-axis or fully below it. Clearly, d1(x, a1) < 0, implies that the quadratic lies fully below the t-axis and vice versa for d1(x, a1) > 0.\nProposition 3.6 If D(x, a1) < 0, then d1(x, a1) < 0.\nProof: Suppose this is not true. Then d1(x, a1) \u2265 0. Hence, b1(x, a1)d1(x, a1) \u2264 0 because by definition of \u03b4j and gj(v0, \u03c00), we have that b1(x, a1) \u2264 0. Thus, we obtain c1(x, a1)c1(x, a1) \u2212 4b1(x, a1)d1(x, a1) \u2265 0 which is a contradiction. Hence, d1(x, a1) < 0.\nThus, for the case when D(x, a1) < 0, any value of t \u2265 0 is fine as the quadratic is fully below the t-axis. Now consider the case where D(x, a1) \u2265 0.

If t11(x, a1) \u2265 t12(x, a1), it can be shown that the region allowed by this constraint is given by the interval [t12(x, a 1), t11(x, a 1)] in the given direction S. Otherwise for t11(x, a 1) < t12(x, a 1), the region allowed by this constraint on the real line is given by the interval ( \u2212\u221e, t11(x, a1) ] \u22c3 [ t12(x, a 1),\u221e ) . Note that this implies that the constraint is not convex. The above explanation can be easily adapted for constraints on the second agent as well. Thus, feasible value ranges for t imposed by the constraints (7(a)) and (7(b)) can be obtained.

Upon substituting \u03c0i(x, aj) = \u03c0i0(x, a j) + tSi\u03c0(x, a j), we get, \u03c0i0(x, a j) + tSi\u03c0(x, a j) \u2265 \u03b4j\u03c0i0(x, aj).

In the next section, we apply this algorithm to a simple terrain exploration problem, modelled as a general-sum discounted stochastic game, and observe in the simulations that the convergence is also to a Nash equilibrium. However, later in Section 5, we show that in general, convergence to a KKT point is not sufficient to guarantee convergence to a Nash equilibrium."}, {"heading": "4 A Simple Terrain Exploration Problem", "text": "A simplified version of the general terrain exploration problem is presented below. Consider a pair of agents that are assigned the task of collecting a set of objects located at various positions in a terrain. We assume that the object positions are known aproiri. The game between the pair of agents terminates if all the objects are collected. The agent movements are considered to be stochastic. Modelling of this problem as a discounted stochastic game \u3008S,A, p, r, \u03b2\u3009 is described as follows. (i) State Space, S - Let the entire terrain be discretized into a grid structure defined by SG = G \u00d7 G where G = {0,\u00b11,\u00b12, . . . ,\u00b1M} . The position of an agent can be represented by a point in SG. Let the position of the ith agent be denoted by xi \u2208 SG with xi(1), xi(2) \u2208 G being its two co-ordinate components. So, the positional part of the overall state space considering the two agents, is given by Sp = SG\u00d7SG. The status regarding whether a particular object is collected or not is also a part of the state space. So, the overall state space would be given by S \u2032 = Sp \u00d7 {0, 1}K , where K is the total number of objects to be collected from the terrain. Let oi represent the Boolean variable for the status of the ith object. Here oi = 0 implies that the ith object is not yet collected and the opposite is true for oi = 1. Thus, x = \u2329 x1, x2, o1, o2, . . . , oK \u232a \u2208 S \u2032 where xi \u2208 SG, i = 1, 2. Let B = {y \u2208 SG : an object is located at y}. The two sets S1 = { x \u2208 S \u2032 : xi \u2208 B and oxi = 0 for some i = 1, 2 }\nand S2 = {x \u2208 S \u2032 : oj = 1 \u2200j = 1 to K} , represent those combinations of states which are not feasible. Thus, the actual state space containing only feasible states is S = [S \u2032\\ (S1 \u222a S2)] \u222a T , where T represents the terminal state of the game. (ii) Action Space, A - The action space of the ith agent can be defined as\nAi(x) = { Go to y \u2208 SG : d\u221e(xi, y) \u2264 1 } ,\nwhere xi \u2208 SG is the position of the ith agent and d\u221e(xi, y) = max(|xi(1)\u2212y(1)|, |xi(2)\u2212y(2)|) is the L\u221e distance metric. The aggregate action space of the two agents at state x \u2208 S\\{T } is given by A(x) = A1(x) \u00d7 A2(x). Note that x = \u2329 x1, x2, o1, o2, . . . , oK \u232a . Thus, the action space does not depend upon the object state except for the termination state T . For the termination state T , the only action available is to stay in the termination state. The action related to the termination state T is ignored in subsequent discussions. (iii) Transition Probability, p(y|x, a) - The movements of each agent are assumed to be independent of other agents. The transition probability pi(yi|xi, ai) for the ith agent is given by pi(yi|xi, ai) = C(xi) 2\u2212d1(ai,yi) \u2200yi \u2208 U i(xi) \u2286 SG, i = 1, 2, where C(xi) =\n\u2211 y\u2208Ui(xi) 2\u2212d1(a i,y) is the normalization factor chosen to make this a\nprobability measure and d1(ai, y) = ( |ai(1) \u2212 y(1)|+ |ai(2) \u2212 y(2)| ) , the L1 norm distance between ai and y. The joint transition probability is given by p(y|x, a) = p1(y1|x1, a1)p2(y2|x2, a2). (iv) Reward function, r(x, a) - To ensure that the two agents do not get to the same position, a penalty may be imposed on the two agents when they attain the same position. Thus, the stochastic reward function for the ith agent can be defined accordingly as\nri(x, a, y) =    \u2212 12 if yi = yj , j = 1, 2, j 6= i and Oy 6= \u30081, 1, . . . , 1\u3009 , 1 if object present at yi,\n0 otherwise,\n(21)\ni = 1, 2.

With the given initial positions of agents and object locations, strategies pertaining only to those positions which an agent can visit with the other agent sticking to its own position\nare plotted. Consider for instance, Figure 3. The figure shows the strategy of the first agent with the second agent sticking to the position (2,0). At the start of the algorithm, all transition probabilities are chosen according to the uniform distribution. In Figures 3 and 4, we show the strategy profile of both the agents after the 1st, 11th and 100th iterations, and upon convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm converged in a total of 278 iterations.\nThe Nash strategies have an interesting structure here which is evident in Figures 3 and 4 as well. The strategies are deterministic except when both agents are in the vicinity of one another. This is expected from the structure of the reward function. Also, it is clear from Figures 3 and 4 that strategy components that are near to the two objects converge faster compared to those which are farther from the two objects. Note that strategy components of those positions which have no probability of being visited by an agent, with the agent being in a particular position, are not shown with arrow marks. For instance, in Figure 3(d), position (1,1) has no probability of being visited by the first agent located at (2,1)."}, {"heading": "5 Non-Convergence to a Nash Equilibrium", "text": "Theorem 2.4 showed that it is both necessary and sufficient for a feasible point \u3008v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217\u3009 to correspond to a Nash equilibrium, if the objective value, f(v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217) = 0. However, for a gradient-based scheme, it would be apt to have conditions represented in terms of gradients of the objective and constraints. In this direction, we now present a series of results which ultimately give the desired set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a minimum point to be a global minimum. For a given point \u3008v, \u03c0\u3009, let G = [\u2207gj(v, \u03c0) : j = 1, 2, . . . , N ] represent a matrix whose columns are gradients of all the constraints (8).\nProposition 5.7 At any given point \u3008v, \u03c0\u3009, the gradient of the objective function f(v, \u03c0), can be expressed as a linear combination of the gradient of all the constraints (8). In other words, \u2207f(v, \u03c0) = G\u03bb\u2032 where \u03bb\u2032 is an appropriate vector.\nProof: Let h1(x, a1) = \u03c02(x)T [ r 1(x, a1,A2(x)) + \u03b2 \u2211\ny\u2208U(x)\nP (y|x, a1,A2(x))v1(y) ] \u2212v1(x). Then, h1(x, a1) \u2264\n0 represents the set of constraints (7(a)). Similarly, let h2(x, a2) = [ r 2(x,A1(x), a2) + \u03b2 \u2211\ny\u2208U(x)\nP (y|x,A1(x), a2)v2(y) ] \u03c01(x)\u2212\nv2(x). Thus, h2(x, a2) \u2264 0 represents the set of constraints (7(b)). Now, we observe that the objective of the optimization problem (7) can be re-expressed in terms of hi(x, ai) and \u03c0i(x, ai), i = 1, 2, as follows:\nf(v, \u03c0) =\n2\u2211\ni=1\n\u2211\nx\u2208S\n\u2212\u03c0i(x, ai)hi(x, ai). (22)\nSo, the objective can be visualized as the sum of products between LHS of (7(a)) and that of corresponding constraints in (7(e)). Note that the equality constraints are easily eliminated as expressed in (8). Thus, all the constraints of interest are inequality constraints which pair up, one from (7(a))-(7(b)) and the other from (7(e))(7(f)). It is now easy to see the desired result by considering the chain-rule of differentiation.\nNote that the vector\u03bb\u2032 discussed in the proposition 5.7, is in value the same as the negative of the pair constraint. For instance, let for some j, gj(v, \u03c0) = hi(x, ai). Then, \u03bb\u2032j = \u2212\u03c0i(x, ai). Similarly, for some j for which gj(v, \u03c0) = \u03c0 i(x, ai), we have \u03bb\u2032j = \u2212hi(x, ai).\nLet \u03bb\u2032 = [ \u03bb\u2032I \u03bb\u2032K ] , where \u03bb\u2032I is the part of \u03bb \u2032 corresponding to active constraints and \u03bb\u2032K is that corresponding\nto inactive constraints. Similarly, let the set of Lagrange multipliers, \u03bb =\n[ \u03bbI\n\u03bbK\n] , where \u03bbI is the part of \u03bb\ncorresponding to active constraints and \u03bbK is that corresponding to inactive constraints.\nLemma 5.8 Under assumption (v) of Section 3.2, if \u03bb\u2032K = 0 at a KKT point \u3008v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217\u3009, then \u03bbI = \u2212\u03bb\u2032I .\nProof: Let G = [GI GK ] be the previously defined matrix of gradients of all constraints, where GI is the part of matrix G containing gradients of all active constraints and GK that containing gradients of all inactive\nconstraints. Now, from proposition 5.7, we have that \u2207f(v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217) = G\u03bb\u2032. From the KKT conditions (20), we have \u2207f(v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217) = \u2212G\u03bb. Combining the two, we get G(\u03bb + \u03bb\u2032) = 0. Since G is full-rank from assumption (v), we have\nGTG(\u03bb + \u03bb\u2032) = 0.\nThis can be re-written as [ GTI GI G T I GK\nGTKGI G T KGK\n][ \u03bbI + \u03bb \u2032 I\n\u03bbK + \u03bb \u2032 K\n] = 0.\nIn other words, we have a set of simultaneous equations as follows:\nGTI GI(\u03bbI + \u03bb \u2032 I) +G T I GK(\u03bbK + \u03bb \u2032 K) = 0, (23)\nGTKGI(\u03bbI + \u03bb \u2032 I) +G T KGK(\u03bbK + \u03bb \u2032 K) = 0. (24)\nNote that at a KKT point, it is easy to see that \u03bbK = 0. Also, we have \u03bb\u2032K = 0. So, from (23), we have,\nGTI GI(\u03bbI + \u03bb \u2032 I) = 0.\nSince GI is of full rank, GTI GI is invertible. Hence, the result.\nCorollary 5.9 Under assumption (v) of Section 3.2, if \u03bb\u2032K = 0 at a KKT point \u3008v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217\u3009, then \u03bb = \u2212\u03bb\u2032.\nProof: At a KKT point, \u03bbK = 0. Thus, the result follows.\nTheorem 5.10 A KKT point \u3008v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217\u3009 corresponds to a Nash equilibrium of the underlying general-sum stochastic game, if and only if \u03bb\u2032K = 0.\nProof: We provide the proof in two parts below. If part: From corollary 5.9, we have \u03bb = \u2212\u03bb\u2032. Let us consider a pair of constraints, hi(x, ai) \u2264 0, and \u03c0i(x, ai) \u2265 0 for some x \u2208 S, ai \u2208 Ai(x), i = 1, 2. We consider the following cases in each of which we show that hi(x, ai)\u03c0i(x, ai) = 0 independent of the choice of x \u2208 S, ai \u2208 Ai(x), i = 1, 2. Thus from (22), it would follow that f(v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217) = 0. The result then follows from theorem 2.4.\n1. When hi(x, ai) < 0 and \u03c0i(x, ai) = 0 or hi(x, ai) = 0 and \u03c0i(x, ai) > 0 or hi(x, ai) = 0 and \u03c0i(x, ai) = 0\nthe result follows.\n2. The case when hi(x, ai) < 0 and \u03c0i(x, ai) < 0 does not occur. We prove this by contradiction. Suppose\nthis case holds. Since hi(x, ai) < 0, is an inactive constraint, by complementary slackness KKT condition (20(b)), we have that the corresponding \u03bbj = 0 = \u2212\u03bb\u2032j = \u03c0i(x, ai). Thus, this case does not occur.\nOnly if part: If a KKT point \u3008v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217\u3009 corresponds to a Nash equilibrium, then by theorem 2.4, we have that f(v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217) = 0. From equation (22), we have\n2\u2211\ni=1\n\u2211\nx\u2208S\n\u2212\u03c0i(x, ai)hi(x, ai) = 0.\nSince a KKT point is always a feasible point of the optimization problem (7), every summand in this equation is non-negative. So, we have\n\u03c0i(x, ai)hi(x, a i) = 0, \u2200x \u2208 S, ai \u2208 Ai(x), i = 1, 2. (25)\nNow from (25) and the complementary slackness KKT condition (20(b)), it is easy to see that \u03bb\u2032K = 0.\nDefinition 2 (KKT-N point) A KKT point \u3008v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217\u3009 of the optimization problem (7) is defined to be a KKT-N (KKT-Nash) point, if the matrix G\u2032 = GTK ( I \u2212GI(GTI GI)\u22121GTI ) GK , computed at the KKT point, is full rank.\nLemma 5.11 Under assumption (v) of Section 3.2, a KKT-N point \u3008v\u2217, \u03c0\u2217\u3009 of the optimization problem (7), corresponds to a Nash equilibrium of the underlying general-sum discounted stochastic game.\nProof: From assumption (v), we have that GI is full-rank and hence GTI GI is invertible. So, (23) can be simplified to get\n(\u03bbI + \u03bb \u2032 I) = \u2212 ( GTI GI )\u22121 GTI GK(\u03bbK + \u03bb \u2032 K).\nNote that \u03bbK = 0 by definition at a KKT point. The above can be substituted in (24) and simplified to get\nGTK ( I \u2212GI(GTI GI)\u22121GTI ) GK\u03bb \u2032 K = 0.\nSince at a KKT-N point, the matrix GTK ( I \u2212GI(GTI GI)\u22121GTI ) GK is full-rank, we have \u03bb\u2032K = 0. Now we have the desired result from theorem 5.10.\nThus, we have a sufficient condition for a KKT point to correspond to a Nash equilibrium. Note that the matrix G\u2032 that needs to be of full rank is dependent on (i) the reward function and state transition probabilities of the underlying stochastic game, (ii) the value function and strategy-pair at the current KKT point, and (iii) the set of active and inactive constraints. These dependencies are highly non-linear and difficult to separate. Using this sufficient condition, we can obtain a weak result on the convergence of gradient-based algorithms to Nash equilibrium solutions, as follows. Here by gradient-based algorithms, we mean those algorithms which assure convergence to a KKT point of a given optimization problem. For instance, the algorithm given in Section 3 is one such algorithm.\nTheorem 5.12 Under assumption (v) of Section 3.2, if every KKT point is also a KKT-N point, then any gradientbased algorithm when applied to the optimization problem (7) would converge to a point corresponding to a Nash equilibrium of the underlying general-sum discounted stochastic game.\nOn the contrary, if a general-sum discounted stochastic game is such that there is at least one KKT point which\nis not a KKT-N point, then convergence of plain gradient-based algorithms to Nash equilibrium is not assured."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We first proposed a simple gradient descent scheme for solution of general-sum stochastic games. During the construction of the scheme, we discussed the overall nature of the indefinite objective and non-convex constraints illustrating the fact that a simple steepest descent algorithm may not even converge to a local minimum of the optimization problem. The proposed scheme takes these issues while constructing both (i) feasible search direction as well as, (ii) optimal step-length. Also, it tries to address numerical efficiency by appropriately using sparsity techniques for an associated matrix inversion. We observed that the size of the optimization problem increases exponentially in the number of variables and the number of constraints. We showed that the proposed scheme converges to a KKT point of the optimization problem. This was seen to be sufficient in simulations performed for the example problem of terrain exploration. However, in general, we showed in Section 5 that it may not be sufficient for a scheme to converge to any KKT point as the same may not correspond to a Nash equilibrium. The\nresults discussed in Section 5 can be easily generalized to the case where there are more than two players. In summary, usual gradient schemes could possibly suffer from two issues: (i) Non-convergence to Nash equilibria which is the more serious of the two issues, and (ii) scalability to higher problem sizes. In would be interesting to derive gradient-based algorithms that provide guaranteed convergence to Nash equilibria."}], "references": [{"title": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning: Algorithm converging to Nash equilibrium in general-sum stochastic games", "author": ["N.

This is however not the case with general-sum stochastic games. A fairly general optimization problem formulation is available for general-sum stochastic games by Filar and Vrieze [2004]. However, the optimization problem there has a non-linear objective and non-linear constraints with special structure. Since gradients of both the objective as well as constraints of this optimization problem are well defined, gradient based schemes seem to be a natural choice. We discuss a gradient scheme tuned for two-player stochastic games. We show in simulations that this scheme indeed converges to a Nash equilibrium, for a simple terrain exploration problem modelled as a general-sum stochastic game. However, it turns out that only global minima of the optimization problem correspond to Nash equilibria of the underlying general-sum stochastic game, while gradient schemes only guarantee convergence to local minima. We then provide important necessary conditions for gradient schemes to converge to Nash equilibria in general-sum stochastic games.", "creator": "dvips(k) 5.991 Copyright 2011 Radical Eye Software"}}}
