Because the specification of a hedonic game requires the expression of each player\u2019s ranking over all sets of players including him, in general, such a specification requires exponential space \u2013 and, when used by a centralised mechanism, exponential elicitation time. Such an exponential blow-up severely limits the practical applicability of hedonic games, and for this reason researchers have investigated compactly represented hedonic games. One approach to this problem has been to consider possible restrictions on the possible preferences that players have. For example, one may\n\u2217This paper was presented at the Eleventh Conference on Logic and the Foundations of Game and Decision Theory (LOFT 2014) in Bergen, Norway, July 27-30, 2014.\nassume that each player specifies only a ranking over single players, and that her preferences over coalitions are defined according to the identity of the best (respectively, worst) element of the coalition (Cechl\u00e1rov\u00e1 and Hajdukov\u00e1, 2004; Cechl\u00e1rov\u00e1, 2008). One may also assume that each player\u2019s preferences depend only on the number of players in her coalition (Bogomolnaia and Jackson, 2002). These representations come with a domain restriction, i.e., a loss of expressivity: Elkind and Wooldridge (2009) consider a fully expressive representation for hedonic games, based on weighted logical formulas. In the worst case, the representation of Elkind and Wooldridge requires space exponential in the number of players, but in many cases the space requirement is much smaller.\nIn this paper, we consider another natural restriction on player preferences. We consider hedonic games with dichotomous preferences. The assumption of dichotomous preferences means that each player\u2019s preference relation partitions the set of coalitions of which that player is a member into just two equivalence classes: satisfactory and unsatisfactory. A player is indifferent between satisfactory coalitions, and is indifferent between unsatisfactory coalitions, but strictly prefers any satisfactory coalition over any unsatisfactory coalition.\nWhile to the best of our knowledge dichotomous preferences have not been previously studied in the context of hedonic games, they have of course been studied in other economic settings, such as by Bogomolnaia et al. (2005), Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2004), and Bouveret and Lang (2008) in the context of fair division, by Harrenstein et al. (2001) in the context of Boolean games, by Konieczny and Pino-P\u00e9rez (2002) in the context of belief merging, by Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2004) in the context of matching, and by Brams and Fishburn (2007) (and many others) in the context of approval voting.\nWhen the space of all possible alternatives has a combinatorial structure, propositional formulas are a very natural representation of dichotomous preferences. In such a representation, variables correspond to goods (in fair division), outcome variables (Boolean games), state variables (belief merging), or players (coalition formation). In the latter case, which we will be concerned with in the present paper, each player i can express her preferences over coalitions containing her by using propositional atoms of the form ij (j 6= i), meaning that j is in the same coalition as i. Thus, for example, player 1 can express by the formula (12\u2228 13)\u2227\u00ac14 that he wants to be in a coalition with player 2 or with player 3, but not with player 4. Our primary aim in this paper is to present such a propositional framework for specifying hedonic games and computing various solution concepts. We will first define a propositional logic using atoms of the form ij, together with domain axioms expressing that the output of the game should be a partition of the set of players. Then we consider a range of solution concepts, and show that they can be characterised by some specific classes of (sometimes polysize) formulas, and solved using propositional satisfiability solvers. The result is a simple, natural, and compact representation scheme for expressing preferences, and a machinery based on satisfiability for computing partitions satisfying some specific stability criteria such as Nash stability or core stability."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In this section, we recall some definitions relating to coalitions, coalition structures (or partitions), and hedonic games. See, e.g., Chalkiadakis et al. (2011) for an in-depth discussion of these and related concepts.\nCoalitions and Partitions We consider a setting in which there is a set N of n players with typical elements i, j, k, . . . . Players can form coalitions, which we will denote by S, T, . . . . A coalition is simply a subset of the players N . One may usefully think of the players as getting together to form teams that will work together. A coalition structure is an exhaustive partition \u03c0 = {S1, . . . , Sm} of the players into disjoint coalitions, i.e., S1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a Sm = N and Si \u2229 Sj = \u2205 for all Si, Sj \u2208 \u03c0 such that i 6= j. For technical convenience, we slightly deviate from standard conventions and require that every coalition structure \u03c0 contains the empty set \u2205. We commonly refer to coalition structures simply as partitions. In examples, we also write, e.g., [12 |34 | 5 ] rather than the more cumbersome {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5}, \u2205}. For each player i in N , we let Ni = {S \u2286 N : i \u2208 S} denote the set of coalitions over N that contain i. If \u03c0 = {S1, . . . , Sm} is a partition, then \u03c0(i) refers to the coalition in \u03c0 that player i is a member of.\nThe notion of players leaving their own coalition and joining another lies at the basis of many of the solution concepts that we will come to consider. We introduce some notation to represent such situations. For T a group of players (not necessarily a coalition in \u03c0), by \u03c0|T we refer to the partition {S1 \u2229 T, . . . , Sm \u2229 T } and we write \u03c0|\u2212T for \u03c0|N\\T . Moreover, for S a coalition in partition \u03c0|\u2212T , we use \u03c0[T \u2192 S] to refer to the partition that results if the players in T leave their respective coalitions in \u03c0 and join coalition S. We also allow T to form a coalition of its own, in which case we write \u03c0[T \u2192 \u2205]. Formally, we have, for S \u2208 \u03c0|\u2212T ,\n\u03c0[T \u2192 S] = {Sj \u2208 \u03c0|\u2212T : Sj 6= S} \u222a {S \u222a T, \u2205}.\nIf T is a singleton {i} we also write \u03c0|\u2212i and \u03c0[i \u2192 S] instead of \u03c0|\u2212{i} and \u03c0[{i} \u2192 S], respectively. Thus, e.g., S\u222a{i} \u2208 \u03c0[i \u2192 S] and \u03c0[i \u2192 \u03c0(i)\\{i}] = \u03c0.\nFinally, define \u03c0[i \u21c4 j] as the partition where i and j exchange their places, i.e.:\n\u03c0[i \u21c4 j] = (\u03c0 \\ {\u03c0(i), \u03c0(j)}) \u222a {(\u03c0(i) \\ {i}) \u222a {j}, (\u03c0(j) \\ {j}) \u222a {i}}.\nThus, for partition \u03c0 = [123|45], we have \u03c0(1) = \u03c0(2) = {1, 2, 3} and \u03c0(4) = {4, 5}. Furthermore, \u03c0|{1,2,4,5} = [12|45] and \u03c0|\u2212{3,4} = [12|5]. Also, \u03c0[1 \u2192 {4, 5}] = [23|145], \u03c0[1 \u2192 \u2205] = [1|23|45], and \u03c0[3 \u21c4 4] = [124|35].\nHedonic games Hedonic games are the class of coalition formation games in which each player is only interested in the coalition he is a member of, and is indifferent as to how the players outside his own coalition are grouped. Hedonic games were originally introduced by Dr\u00e8ze and Greenberg (1980) and further developed by, e.g., Bogomolnaia and Jackson (2002). Also see Hajdukov\u00e1 (2006)\nfor a survey from a more computational point of view. Formally, a hedonic game is a tuple (N,R1, . . . , Rn), where Ri represents i\u2019s transitive, reflexive, and complete preferences over the set of all coalitions Ni containing i. Thus, S Ri T intuitively signifies that player i considers coalition S at least as desirable as coalition T , where S and T are coalitions in Ni. By Pi and Ii we denote the strict and the indifferent part of Ri, respectively. The preferences Ri of a player i are said to be dichotomous whenever Ni can be partitioned into two disjoint sets N +i and N \u2212 i such that i strictly prefers all coalitions in N +\ni to those in N \u2212i and is indifferent otherwise, i.e., S Pi T if and only if S \u2208 N + i and T \u2208 N \u2212i . A coalition S in Ni is acceptable to i if i (weakly) prefers S to coalition {i}, where he is on his own, i.e., if S Ri {i}. By contrast, we say that a coalition S is satisfactory or desirable for i if S \u2208 N +i . Satisfactory partitions are thus generally acceptable to all players. The implication in the other direction, however, does not hold.\nWe lift preferences on coalitions to preferences on partitions in a natural way: player i prefers partition \u03c0 to partition \u03c0\u2032 whenever i prefers coalition \u03c0(i) to coalition \u03c0\u2032(i). We also extend the concepts of acceptability and desirability of coalitions to partitions.\nExample 1 Consider the following Boolean game with four players, 1, 2, 3, and 4, whose (dichotomous) preferences are as follows. (Indifferences are indicated by commas.)\n1: {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4} P1 {1}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}\n2: {2, 1, 3}, {2, 1, 4}, {2, 3, 4} P2 {2}, {2, 1}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {2, 1, 3, 4}\n3: {3, 1}, {3, 2}, {3, 1, 2} P3 {3}, {3, 4}, {3, 1, 4}, {3, 2, 4}, {3, 1, 2, 4}\n4: {4, 1}, {4, 2}, {4, 3}, {4, 1, 2}, {4, 1, 3}, {4} P4 {4, 2, 3}, {4, 1, 2, 3}\nThus, player 1 wants to be in a coalition of at least three and player 2 wishes to be in a coalition of exactly three. Moreover, player 3 wants to be in the same coalition as player 1 or as 2. He does not want to be in a coalition with player 4. Finally, player 4 does not want to be with players 2 and 3 together. There is exactly one partition that is satisfactory for all four players, namely [123 |4]. For players 1, 2, and 3, all coalitions are acceptable. For player 4, however, {4, 2, 3} and {1, 2, 3, 4} are unacceptable.\nSolution Concepts for Hedonic Games A solution concept associates with every hedonic game (N,R1, . . . , Rn) a (possibly empty) set of partitions of N . Here we review some of the most common solution concepts for hedonic games.\nIndividual rationality captures the idea that every player prefers the coalition he is in to being on his own, i.e., that coalitions are acceptable to its members. Thus, formally, \u03c0 is individually rational if, for all players i in N ,\n\u03c0(i) Ri {i}.\nThis condition is obviously equivalent to \u03c0 Ri \u03c0[i \u2192 \u2205].\nFor dichotomous hedonic games, a partition \u03c0 is said to be social welfare optimal if it maximises the number of players who are in a satisfactory coalition, that is, if \u03c0 maximises |{i \u2208 N : \u03c0(i) \u2208 N +i }|. In a similar way, a partition \u03c0 is Pareto optimal if it maximises the set of players being in a satisfactory coalition with respect to set-inclusion, that is, if there is no partition \u03c0\u2032 with\n{i \u2208 N : \u03c0(i) \u2208 N +i } ( {i \u2208 N : \u03c0 \u2032(i) \u2208 N +i }.\nIn the extreme case in which every player is in a most preferred coalition, \u03c0 is said to be perfect (cf., Aziz et al., 2013). A perfect partition satisfies any other of our stability concepts.\nA partition is Nash stable if no player would like to unilaterally abandon the coalition he is in and join any other existing coalition or stay on his own, that is, if, for all i \u2208 N and all S \u2208 \u03c0,\n\u03c0(i) Ri S \u222a {i}.\nObserve that this condition is equivalent to \u03c0 Ri \u03c0[i \u2192 S].\nCore stability concepts consider group deviations instead of individual ones. A group of players, possibly from different coalitions, is said to block a partition if they would all benefit by joining together in a separate coalition. Formally, T blocks (or is blocking) partition \u03c0 if, for all i \u2208 T ,\nT Pi \u03c0(i).\nThus, T blocks \u03c0 if and only if \u03c0[T \u2192 \u2205] Pi \u03c0 for all i \u2208 T . A group T weakly blocks (or is weakly blocking) \u03c0 if T Ri \u03c0(i) holds for all i \u2208 T and T Pi \u03c0(i) holds for some i \u2208 T . Then, \u03c0 is core stable if no group is blocking it and \u03c0 is strict core stable if no group is weakly blocking it.\nPartition \u03c0 is envy-free if no player is envious of another player, that is, if no player i would prefer to change places with another player j. Formally, partition \u03c0 is envy-free if, for all players i and j,\n\u03c0 Ri \u03c0[i \u21c6 j].\nIf \u03c0[i \u21c6 j] Pi \u03c0 we also say that player i envies player j.\nExample 1 (continued) In our example, in partition [1, 2, 3 |4] each player is in a most preferred coalition. As such [1, 2, 3 |4] is perfect as well as social welfare optimal and satisfies all solution concepts mentioned above. Moreover, all partitions except [1 |2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4] individually rational.\nNow, consider partition \u03c0 = [1 |2, 3 |4]. Here, player 2 does not want to abandon her coalition {2, 3} and join another as she prefers none of the following partitions to \u03c0: \u03c0[2 \u2192 {1}] = [1, 2 |3 |4], \u03c0[2 \u2192 {2, 3}] = [1 |2, 3 |4], \u03c0[2 \u2192 {4}], and \u03c0[2 \u2192 \u2205] = [1 |2 |3 |4]. As, however, \u03c0[1 \u2192 {2, 3}] = [1, 2, 3 |4] and [1, 2, 3 |4] P1 \u03c0, partition \u03c0 is not Nash stable.\nAlso observe that for \u03c0 = [1 |2, 3 |4] the group {1, 2, 3} is strongly blocking, as \u03c0[{1, 2, 4} \u2192 \u2205] = [1, 2, 4 |3] and [1, 2, 4 |3] Pi \u03c0 for all i \u2208 {1, 2, 4}. Thus, \u03c0 is not core stable. By contrast, [1, 4 |2, 3] is core stable as only player 1 and 2 are not satisfied and both of them will only be if they can form a blocking coalition of exactly three. However, {1, 2, 4} is still weakly blocking, and as such [1, 4 |2, 3] is not strict core stable.\nFor envy-freeness, consider partition \u03c0\u2032 = [1 |2, 4 |3]. Then, player 3 envies player 4, as \u03c0\u2032[3 \u21c6 4] = [1 |2, 3 |4] and [1 |2, 3 |4] P3 \u03c0\u2032. By contrast, player 3 does not envy player 2: we have \u03c0\u2032[3 \u21c6 2] = [1 |2 |3, 4] but not [1 |2 |3, 4] P3 \u03c0\u2032."}, {"heading": "3 A Logic for Coalition Structures", "text": "In this section, we develop a logic for representing coalition structures. We will then use this logic as a compact specification language for dichotomous preference relations in hedonic games.\nSyntax Given a set N of n players, we define a propositional language LN built from the usual connectives and with for every (unordered) pair {i, j} of distinct players a propositional variable p{i,j}. The set of propositional variables we denote by V . Observe that |V | = (\nn 2\n)\n. For notational convenience we will write ij for p{i,j}. Thus, ij and ji refer to the same symbol. The language is interpreted on coalition structures on N and the informal meaning of ij is \u201ci and j are in the same coalition\u201d. Formally, the formulas of the language LN , with typical element \u03d5 is given by the following grammar\n\u03d5 ::= ij | \u00ac\u03d5 | (\u03d5 \u2228 \u03d5)\nwhere i, j \u2208 N and i 6= j. By |\u03d5| we denote the size of \u03d5. For a given coalition S of players, we write VS for the propositional variables in which some i \u2208 S appears, i.e.,\nVS = {ij \u2208 V : i \u2208 S or j \u2208 S}.\nNote that for distinct players i and j we have Vi \u2229 Vj = {ij}. The propositional language over VS we denote by LS . We write Vi and Li for V{i} and L{i}, respectively. The remaining classical connectives \u22a5, \u22a4, \u2227, \u2192, and \u2194 are defined in the usual way. Moreover, for formulas \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8k of formulas, we have \u2227\n1\u2264m\u2264k \u03c8m and \u2228\n1\u2264m\u2264k \u03c8m abbreviate \u03c81 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 \u03c8k and \u03c81 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 \u03c8k, respectively. We also make use of the following useful notational shorthand:\ni1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 imim+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ip = \u2227\n1\u2264j\u2264m\ni1ij \u2227 \u2227\nm<k\u2264p\n\u00aci1ik.\nThus, i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 imim+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ip conveys that i1, . . . , im are in the same coalition and each of them in another coalition than im+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ip. Thus, where N = {1, 2, 3, 4}, 1234\u22281324\u22281423 abbreviates (12\u2227\u00ac13\u2227\u00ac14)\u2228(13\u2227\u00ac12\u2227\u00ac14)\u2228(14\u2227\u00ac12\u2227\u00ac13) and signifies that player 1 is in a coalition of two players.\nSemantics We interpret the formulas of LN on partitions \u03c0 as follows.\n\u03c0 |= ij if and only if \u03c0(i) = \u03c0(j) \u03c0 |= \u00ac\u03d5 if and only if \u03c0 6|= \u03d5 \u03c0 |= \u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8 if and only if \u03c0 6|= \u03d5 or \u03c0 |= \u03c8\nFor \u03a8 \u2286 LN , we have \u03a8 |= \u03d5 if \u03c0 |= \u03c8 for all \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a8 implies \u03c0 |= \u03d5. If \u03a8 = \u2205, we write |= \u03d5 and say that \u03d5 is valid.\nNotice that partitions play a dual role in our framework: both their initial role as coalition structures, and the role of models in our logic. This dual role is key to using formulas of our propositional language as a specification language for preference relations. Thus, e.g., partition [1|2|345] satisfies the following formulas of LN : 345, 31, 34512, \u00ac12 \u2227 (23 \u2228 34), and 12 \u2194 23.\nAxiomatisation We have the following axiom schemes for mutually distinct players i, j, and k,\n(A0) all propositional tautologies\n(A1) ij \u2227 jk \u2192 ik (transitivity)\nas well as modus ponens as the only rule of the system:\n(MP) from \u03d5 and \u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8 infer \u03c8. (modus ponens)\nThe resulting logic we refer to as P and write \u03a8 \u22a2P \u03d5 if there is a derivation of \u03d5 from \u03a8, (A0), and (A1), using modus ponens.\nTheorem 1 (Completeness) Let \u03a8 \u222a {\u03d5} \u2286 LN . Then,\n\u03a8 \u22a2P \u03d5 if and only if \u03a8 |= \u03d5.\n(sketch): Soundness is straightforward. For completeness a standard Lindenbaum construction can be used. To this end, assume \u03a8 6\u22a2P \u03d5. Then, \u03a8 \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5} is consistent and can as such be extended to a maximal consistent theory \u03a8\u2217. Define a relation \u223c\u03a8\u2217 such that for all i, j \u2208 N ,\ni \u223c\u03a8\u2217 j if and only if ij \u2208 \u03a8 \u2217.\nThe axiom schemes (A0) and (A1) ensure that \u223c\u03a8\u2217 is a well-defined equivalence relation. Let [ i ]\u223c\u03a8\u2217 = {j \u2208 N : i \u223c\u03a8\u2217 j} be the equivalence class under \u223c\u03a8\u2217 to which player i belongs. Then define the partition \u03c0\u03a8\u2217 = {[ i ]\u223c\u03a8\u2217 : i \u2208 N}. By a straightforward structural induction, it can then be shown that for all \u03c8 \u2208 LN ,\n\u03c0\u03a8\u2217 |= \u03c8 if and only if \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a8 \u2217.\nIt follows that \u03c0\u03a8\u2217 |= \u03a8 and \u03c0\u03a8\u2217 6|= \u03d5. Hence, \u03a8 6|= \u03d5. \u2737\nAlternatively, one can reason with coalition structures in standard propositional logic, by writing the transitivity axiom directly as a propositional logic formula. Let\ntrans = \u2227\ni,j,k\u2208N\n(ij \u2227 jk \u2192 ik).\nThen, for any propositional formulas \u03d5 and \u03c8 of LN ,\n\u03d5 \u22a2P \u03c8 if and only if \u03d5 \u2227 trans \u22a2 \u03c8\nthat is, checking whether a formula \u03d5 implies another formula \u03c8 in P is equivalent to saying that \u03d5 together with the transitivity constraint implies \u03c8. This means that reasoning tasks in P can be done with a classical propositional theorem prover. In what follows we say that two formulas \u03d5 and \u03c8 are P-equivalent whenever their equivalence can be proven in P, i.e., \u22a2P \u03d5 \u2194 \u03c8."}, {"heading": "4 Boolean Hedonic Games", "text": "The denotation of a formula \u03d5 of our propositional language is a set of coalition structures, and we can naturally interpret these as being the desirable or satisfactory coalition structures for a particular player. Thus, instead of writing a hedonic game with dichotomous preferences as a structure (N,R1, . . . , Rn), in which we explicitly enumerate preference relations Ri, we can instead write (N, \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3n), where \u03b3i is a formula of our propositional language that acts as a specification of the preference relation Ri. Intuitively, \u03b3i represents player i\u2019s \u2018goal\u2019 and player i is satisfied if his goal is achieved and unsatisfied if he is not. We refer to a structure (N, \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3n) as a Boolean hedonic game. Thus, a Boolean hedonic game (N, \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3n) represents the (standard) hedonic game (N,R1, . . . , Rn) with for each i,\n\u03c0(i) Ri \u03c0 \u2032(i) if and only if \u03c0 |= \u03b3i implies \u03c0 \u2032 |= \u03b3i.\nObserve that, defined thus, the preferences of each player in a hedonic Boolean game are dichotomous.\nIt should be clear that every dichotomous preference relation Ri can be specified by a propositional formula \u03b3i, and hence our propositional language forms a fully expressive representation scheme for Boolean hedonic games.1 In fact, formulas in LN are strictly more expressive in the sense that they can represent any dichotomous preference relation over partitions rather than just preference relations over partitions as induced by a preference relation Ri for a player i over coalitions in Ni. We find, however, that every Boolean hedonic\n1Let i be a player with dichotomous preferences Ri and let Xi be the set of coalitions most preferred by i, i.e., S \u2208 Xi if and only if S Ri S\n\u2032 for all coalitions S and S\u2032 containing i.

Intuitively, formulas in Li only convey information about the coalitions player i is in or she is not in.\nProposition 1 If a Boolean hedonic game (N, \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3n) represents a hedonic game with dichotomous preferences, then for every player i there is a formula \u03d5i \u2208 Li that is P-equivalent to \u03b3i. Moreover, if for every player i there is a formula \u03d5i \u2208 Li that is P-equivalent to \u03b3i, then (N, \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3n) represents a hedonic game with dichotomous preferences.\n(sketch): For a player i and \u03d5 a formula in Li, a straightforward inductive argument shows that\n\u03c0 |= \u03d5 if and only if \u03c0\u2032 |= \u03d5 for all \u03c0\u2032 with \u03c0\u2032(i) = \u03c0(i).\nThen, the result follows as a corollary. \u2737\nOften, the use of propositional formulas \u03b3i gives a \u2018concise\u2019 representation of the preference relation Ri, although of course in the worst case the shortest formula \u03b3i representing Ri may be of size exponential in the number of players. In what follows, we will write (N, \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3n), understanding that we are referring to the game (N,R1, . . . , Rn) corresponding to this specification.\nExample 1 (continued) The hedonic game with dichotomous preferences in Example 1 is represented by the Boolean hedonic game (N, \u03b31, \u03b32, \u03b33, \u03b34) with N = {1, 2, 3, 4} and the players\u2019 goals given by:\n\u03b31 = (123 \u2228 124 \u2228 134) \u03b32 = (2134 \u2228 2143\u2228 2341)\n\u03b33 = (31 \u2228 32) \u2227 \u00ac34 \u03b34 = \u00ac423.\nFor each player i we then have that \u03c0 |= \u03b3i if and only if \u03c0 \u2208 N + i ."}, {"heading": "5 Substitution and Deviation", "text": "We establish a formal link between substitution in formulas of our language and the possibility of players deviating from their respective coalition in a given partition and joining other coalitions.\nSubstitution We first introduce some formal notation and terminology with respect to substitution of formulas for variables in our logic.\nFor ij a propositional variable in VN and \u03d5 and \u03c8 formulas of LN , we denote by \u03d5ij\u2190\u03c8 the uniform substitution of variable ij by \u03c8 in \u03d5. If ~\u0131 = i1j1, . . . , ikjk is a sequence of k distinct variables in V and ~\u03c8 = \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8k a sequence of k formulas,\n\u03d5 ~\u0131\u2190~\u03c8 = \u03d5i1j1,...,ikjk\u2190\u03c81,...,\u03c8k\ndenotes the simultaneous substitution of each imjm by \u03c8m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 k). Thus, e.g., (ij \u2228 \u00acjk)ij,jk\u2190jk,ik = jk \u2228 \u00acik. A special case, which recurs frequently in what follows, is if every \u03c8i is a Boolean, i.e., if \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8k \u2208 {\u22a4,\u22a5}. Sequences ~b = b1, . . . , bk where b1, . . . , bk \u2208 {\u22a4,\u22a5} we will also refer to as Boolean vectors of length k. Thus, e.g., \u22a4,\u22a5 is a Boolean vector of length 2 and (ij \u2227 jk \u2192 ki)ij,ki\u2190\u22a4,\u22a5 = \u22a4 \u2227 jk \u2192 \u22a5.\nCharacterising individual deviations Some of the stability concepts for Boolean hedonic games we consider in this paper, e.g., Nash stability, are based on which coalitions an individual player i can join given a partition \u03c0. Recall that these coalitions are given by \u03c0|\u2212i. Of course, not all groups of agents are included in \u03c0\u2212i. For instance, let partition \u03c0 be given by [ 12 |34 |5 ]. Then, player 1 can join coalition {3, 4} but cannot form a coalition with players 4 and 5 by unilaterally deviating from \u03c0. We find that the set \u03c0|\u2212i can be characterised in our logic. This furthermore yields a logical characterisation of when a player i can unilaterally break loose from his coalition, join another one and thereby guarantee that a given formula \u03d5 will be satisfied. A particularly interesting case is if \u03d5 implies the respective player\u2019s goal. We thus gain expressive power with respect to whether a player can beneficially deviate from a given partition, a crucial concept.\nLemma 1 Let \u03c0 be a partition, i a player, B a group of players in N \\ {i}. Let furthermore ~b = b1, . . . , bn\u22121 be a Boolean vector of length n \u2212 1 and i~ = ij1, . . . , ijn\u22121 an enumeration of Vi such that B = {j : iji~\u2190~b = \u22a4}. Then,\n(i) B \u2208 \u03c0|\u2212i iff \u03c0 |= transi~\u2190~b,\n(ii) B \u2208 \u03c0|\u2212i and \u03c0[i \u2192 B] |= \u03d5 iff \u03c0 |= (\u03d5 \u2227 trans)i~\u2190~b.\nProof: We prove (i); the proof for (ii) is by structural induction on \u03d5 and relies on similar principles as (i). As~b and i~ are fixed throughout the proof, for better readability, we write \u03d5\u2032 for \u03d5\ni~\u2190~b.\nFor the \u201conly if\u201d-direction, assume that B \u2208 \u03c0\u2212i as well as \u03c0 6|= trans \u2032. Observe that trans \u2032 = \u2227\nk,l,m\n( kl\u2032 \u2227 lm\u2032 \u2192 km\u2032 )\n. Accordingly, there are some (mutually distinct) k, l, and m such that \u03c0 6|= kl\u2032 \u2227 lm\u2032 \u2192 km\u2032. It suffices to consider the following three cases.\n(a) i /\u2208 {k, l,m}, (b) i = k, (c) i = l.\nCase (a) cannot occur as we would have kl\u2032 = kl, lm\u2032 = lm, km\u2032 = km, and kl \u2227 lm \u2192 km is a theorem of the system.\nIf (b), then \u03c0 6|= il\u2032 \u2227 lm\u2032 \u2192 im\u2032. It follows that \u03c0 |= il\u2032, \u03c0 |= lm\u2032, and \u03c0 6|= im\u2032. Observe that in this case lm\u2032 = lm. Hence, \u03c0(l) = \u03c0(m). Also notice that il\u2032, im\u2032 \u2208 {\u22a4,\u22a5} and, thus, im\u2032 = \u22a5 and il\u2032 = \u22a4. Accordingly, l \u2208 B but m /\u2208 B. As i 6= m and having assumed B \u2208 \u03c0|\u2212i, a contradiction follows:\n\u03c0(m) 6= \u03c0(i) = \u03c0(l) = \u03c0(m).\nIf (c), we have \u03c0 6|= ik\u2032 \u2227 im\u2032 \u2192 km\u2032. Thus, \u03c0 |= ik\u2032, \u03c0 |= im\u2032, and \u03c0 6|= km\u2032. Observe that km\u2032 = km. Hence, \u03c0(k) 6= \u03c0(m). Moreover, ik\u2032, im\u2032 \u2208 {\u22a4,\u22a5}, from which follows that ik\u2032 = \u22a4 and im\u2032 = \u22a4. Accordingly, both k,m \u2208 B. With B \u2208 \u03c0|\u2212i, we obtain that \u03c0(k) = \u03c0(m), a contradiction.\nFor the \u201cif\u201d-direction, assume B /\u2208 \u03c0|\u2212i and B 6= \u2205. Because of the latter, there is some j \u2208 B. Accordingly, ij\u2032 = \u22a4. As B /\u2208 \u03c0|\u2212i, and thus in particular B 6= \u03c0(j) \\ {i}, there are two possibilities:\n(1) there is some k 6= i with k \u2208 \u03c0(j) and k /\u2208 B, or\n(2) there is some k 6= i with k /\u2208 \u03c0(j) and k \u2208 B.\nIf (1), we have \u03c0(j) = \u03c0(k) as well as ik\u2032 = \u22a5. As jk\u2032 = jk, it holds that \u03c0 |= ij\u2032 \u2227 jk\u2032 but \u03c0 6|= ik\u2032. If (2), however, we have \u03c0(j) 6= \u03c0(k) and ik\u2032 = \u22a4. As jk\u2032 = jk, it holds that \u03c0 |= ij\u2032 \u2227 ik\u2032 but \u03c0 6|= jk\u2032. In either case it follows that \u03c0 6|= trans \u2032. \u2737\nThe following example illustrates Lemma 1.\nExample 2 Consider the partition \u03c0 = [12 |34 |5]. Then, \u03c0|\u22121 = {{2}, {34}, {5}, \u2205}. Let 1~ = 12, 13, 14, 15 be a fixed enumeration of V1. Also let ~b1 = \u22a5,\u22a4,\u22a4,\u22a5 and ~b2 = \u22a5,\u22a4,\u22a5,\u22a4 be Boolean vectors (of length 4). Then,\n[ 12 |34 |5 ] |= trans12,13,14,15\u2190\u22a5,\u22a4,\u22a4,\u22a5.\n(This may be established, somewhat tediously, by painstakingly checking all 30 conjuncts of the form (kl \u2227 lm) \u2192 km of trans.) Now, observe that {j : 1j\n1~j\u2190~b1 } = {3, 4} and that {3, 4} \u2208 \u03c0\u22121. On the other hand, observe that\n(13 \u2227 15 \u2192 35) 1~\u2190~b2 = (\u22a4 \u2227 \u22a4) \u2192 35. It is easily established, however, that [12|34|5] does not satisfy (\u22a4\u2227\u22a4) \u2192 35 and, hence, neither trans 1~\u2190~b2 . Finally, observe that {j : 1j 1~\u2190~b1 } = {3, 5} and that {3, 5} is not in \u03c0|\u22121.\nWe now introduce the following abbreviation, where i~ = ij1, . . . , ijn\u22121 is assumed to be a fixed enumeration of Vi.\n\u2203\u0302i \u03d5 = \u2228\n~b\u2208{\u22a5,\u22a4}n\u22121\n(\u03d5 \u2227 trans) i~\u2190~b\nThus, \u2203\u0302i can be understood as the operation of forgetting everything about player i (in the sense of Lin and Reiter (1994)) while taking the transitivity\nconstraint into account. Intuitively, \u2203\u0302i \u03d5 signifies that given partition \u03c0 player i can deviate to some coalition such that that \u03d5 is satisfied.\nProposition 2 Let \u03c0 be a partition, i a player, and \u03d5 a formula of LN . Then,\n\u03c0 |= \u2203\u0302i \u03d5 iff \u03c0[i \u2192 S] |= \u03d5 for some S \u2208 \u03c0|\u2212i,\nProof: First assume \u03c0 |= \u2203\u0302i \u03d5. Then, \u03c0 |= (\u03d5 \u2227 trans) i~\u2190~b for some\n~b \u2208\n{\u22a5,\u22a4}n\u22121. Define S = {j : ij i~\u2190~b = \u22a4}. By Lemma 1(ii), we then obtain \u03c0[i \u2192 S] |= \u03d5. For the opposite direction, assume that \u03c0[i \u2192 S] |= \u03d5 for some S \u2208 \u03c0|\u2212i. Define ~b = b1, . . . , bn\u22121 as the Boolean vector of length n\u22121 such that for every 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n\u2212 1,\nbk =\n{\n\u22a4 if j \u2208 S \u222a {i}\n\u22a5 otherwise.\nThen, clearly, S = {j : ij i~\u2190~b = \u22a4}. By Lemma 1(ii), it follows that \u03c0 |= \u03d5i~\u2190~b. We may conclude that \u03c0 |= \u2203\u0302i \u03d5. \u2737\nIt is important to note, however, that the number of Boolean vectors of length k is exponential in k. Accordingly, \u2203\u0302i \u03d5 abbreviates a formula whose size is exponential in the size of \u03d5.\nCharacterising group deviations Besides a single player deviating from its coalition and joining another, multiple players (from possibly different coalitions) could also deviate together and form a coalition of their own. This concept lies at the basis of, e.g., the core stability concept. We establish a formal connection between substitution and group deviations.\nLet T = {i1, . . . , it} be a group of players. Observe that |VT | = ( n 2 ) \u2212 ( n\u2212t 2 ) and let ~\u0131T be a fixed enumeration of VT . By the T -separating Boolean vector (given ~\u0131T ) we define as the unique Boolean vector ~bT of length ( n 2 ) \u2212 ( n\u2212t 2 )\nsuch that for all i \u2208 T and all j \u2208 N ,\nij ~\u0131 T \u2190~bT =\n{\n\u22a4 if j \u2208 T ,\n\u22a5 otherwise.\nIntuitively, ~bT represents the choice of group T to form a coalition of their own. Whenever T is clear from the context we omit the subscript in ~bT and ~\u0131T . The following characterisation now holds.\nLemma 2 Let (N, \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3n) be a Boolean hedonic game, T a group of players, \u03c0 a partition, ~\u0131 a fixed enumeration of VT , and ~bT the corresponding T - separating Boolean vector. Then, for every formula \u03d5 \u2208 LN ,\n\u03c0 |= \u03d5 ~\u0131\u2190~bT if and only if \u03c0[T \u2192 \u2205] |= \u03d5."}, {"heading": "6 Characterising Solutions", "text": "Our task in this section is to show how the various solution concepts we introduced above can be characterised as formulas of our propositional language. Let f be a function mapping each Boolean hedonic game G for N to a formula f(G) of LN . Given a solution concept \u03b8, we say that f is a characterisation of \u03b8 if for every Boolean hedonic game G on N and every partition \u03c0, we\nhave that \u03c0 is a solution according to \u03b8 for game G if and only if \u03c0 |= f(G). If, furthermore, there exists a polynomial p such that |f(G)| \u2264 p(|N |), then f is a polynomial characterisation of \u03b8.\nOnce we have a characterisation of \u03b8, we know that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the partitions of N satisfying \u03b8 and the models of f(G). Therefore, given a Boolean hedonic game G:\n\u2022 checking whether there exists a partition satisfying \u03b8 in G amounts to checking whether f(G) is satisfiable;\n\u2022 computing a partition satisfying \u03b8 in G amounts to finding a model of f(G);\n\u2022 computing all partitions satisfying \u03b8 in G amounts to finding all models of f(G).\nThus, once we have a characterisation of a solution concept, one can use a SAT solver to find (some or all) or to check the existence of partitions that satisfy it. This carries over to conjunctions of solution concepts. For instance, if individual rationality is characterised by fIR and envy-freeness by fEF , the there is a one-to-one correspondence between the individual rational envy-free partitions for G and the models of fIR(G) \u2227 fEF (G). More generally, these techniques can be used for finding or checking partitions satisfying \u03b8 that also have certain other properties expressible in LN .\nIn the remainder of the section we focus on how a number of classical solution concepts, and see how they can be characterised in our logic.\nIndividual rationality, perfection, and optimality Recall that a partition is individually rational if any player is at least as happy in her coalition as being alone, that is, no player would prefer to leave her coalition to form a singleton coalition. Now we have the following characterisation of individual rationality in our logic.\nProposition 3 Let (N, \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3n) be a Boolean hedonic game, let i be a player with goal \u03b3, and let \u03c0 be a partition. Let, furthermore, i~ be a fixed enumeration of Vi and let ~b = \u22a5, . . . ,\u22a5 be the Boolean vector of length n \u2212 1 only containing \u22a5. Then,\n(i) \u03c0 is acceptable to i iff \u03c0 |= (\u03b3i)i~\u2190~b \u2192 \u03b3i,\n(ii) \u03c0 is individually rational iff \u03c0 |= \u2227\ni\u2208N\n( (\u03b3i)i~\u2190~b \u2192 \u03b3i ) .\nProof: We only give the proof for (i), as (ii) follows as an immediate consequence. For (i), merely consider the following equivalences, of which the third\none follows from Lemma 1(ii).\n\u03c0 is acceptable to i iff \u03c0 Ri \u03c0[i \u2192 \u2205]\niff \u03c0[i \u2192 \u2205] |= \u03b3i implies \u03c0 |= \u03b3i\niff \u03c0 |= (\u03b3i)i~\u2190~b implies \u03c0 |= \u03b3i iff \u03c0 |= (\u03b3i)i~\u2190~b \u2192 \u03b3i.\nThis concludes the proof. \u2737\nTo illustrate Proposition 3 we consider again Example 1.\nExample 1 (continued) In the game of our example, all partitions are acceptable to player 1, whose goal is given by \u03b31 = 123 \u2228 124 \u2228 134. Let V1 be enumerated by 1~ = 12, 13, 14 and let ~b = \u22a5,\u22a5,\u22a5. Then, (\u03b32)12,13,14\u2190\u22a5,\u22a5,\u22a5 is P-equivalent to \u22a5 and, hence, \u03c0 |= (\u03b32)12,13,14\u2190\u22a5,\u22a5,\u22a5 \u2192 \u03b31 for all partitions \u03c0. According to Proposition 3 this signifies that to player 1 every partition is acceptable.\nNow consider player 4, whose goal is given by \u00ac423, that is, by \u00ac(42 \u2227 43). Let V4 be enumerated by 41, 42, 43 and let ~b = \u22a5,\u22a5,\u22a5. Then, \u00ac(42 \u2227 43)41,42,43\u2190\u22a5,\u22a5,\u22a5 = \u00ac(\u22a5 \u2227 \u22a5), which is obviously P-equivalent to \u22a4. Hence,\n\u03c0 |= \u00ac(42 \u2227 43)41,42,43\u2190\u22a5,\u22a5,\u22a5 if and only if \u03c0 |= \u00ac(42 \u2227 43),\nmeaning that a partition \u03c0 is acceptable to player 4 if and only if \u03c0 satisfies his goal.\nThe logical characterisation of perfect perfect partition is immediate, as witnessed by the following proposition.\nProposition 4 Let (N, \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3n) be a Boolean hedonic game. Then, a partition \u03c0 is perfect if and only if \u03c0 |= \u2227\ni\u2208N\n\u03b3i.\nAs a consequence, a perfect partition exists if and only if the formula trans \u2227 \u2227\ni\u2208N \u03b3i is satisfiable. Moreover, finding a social welfare maximising partition reduces to finding valuation satisfying a maximum number of formulas \u03b3i\u2227trans , that is, to solving a maxsat problem.\nLeveraging the same idea of iteratively checking whether a perfect partition can be found for a subset of agents, one can compute Pareto optimal solutions for a given game. A subset \u03a8 of formulas is said to be a maximal trans-consistent if both\n(i) \u03a8 \u222a {trans} is consistent, and\n(ii) \u03a8\u2032 \u222a {trans} is inconsistent for all sets of formulas \u03a8\u2032 with \u03a8 ( \u03a8\u2032.\nWe now have the following proposition.\nProposition 5 A partition \u03c0 of a Boolean hedonic game is Pareto optimal if and only if {\u03b3i : \u03c0 |= \u03b3i} is a maximal trans-consistent subset of {\u03b31, . . . , \u03b3n}\nAlgorithms for computing maximal consistent subsets are well-known and could thus be exploited for the computation of Pareto optimal partitions.\nNash stability Recall that a partition \u03c0 is Nash stable, if no player i wishes to leave his coalition \u03c0(i) and join another (possibly empty) coalition so as to satisfy his goal. Leveraging our results from Section 5, we obtain the following characterisation of this fundamental solution concept.\nProposition 6 Let (N, \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3n) be a Boolean hedonic game and \u03c0 a partition. Then,\n\u03c0 is Nash stable if and only if \u03c0 |= \u2227\ni\u2208N\n( (\u2203\u0302i \u03b3i) \u2192 \u03b3i ) .\nProof: Consider an arbitrary player i and observe that following equivalences hold. The fourth equivalence holds in virtue of Proposition 2. The third one is a standard law of logic: merely observe that \u03c0 |= \u03b3i is not dependent on S.\n\u03c0 is Nash stable\niff for all i \u2208 N and S \u2208 \u03c0|\u2212i: \u03c0 Ri \u03c0[i \u2192 S]\niff for all i \u2208 N and S \u2208 \u03c0|\u2212i: if \u03c0[i \u2192 S] |= \u03b3i then \u03c0 |= \u03b3i\niff for all i \u2208 N : if \u03c0[i \u2192 S] |= \u03b3i for some S \u2208 \u03c0|\u2212i then \u03c0 |= \u03b3i\niff for all i \u2208 N : if \u03c0 |= \u2203\u0302i \u03b3i then \u03c0 |= \u03b3i\niff for all i \u2208 N : \u03c0 |= (\u2203\u0302i \u03b3i) \u2192 \u03b3i iff \u03c0 |= \u2227\ni\u2208N\n( (\u2203\u0302i \u03b3i) \u2192 \u03b3i )\nThis concludes the proof. \u2737\nOur running example illustrates this result.\nExample 1 (continued) Consider again the game of Example 1. Partition [123|4] satisfies each player\u2019s goal and, consequently, is Nash stable. We also have that [123|4] |= \u03b31 \u2227 \u03b32 \u2227 \u03b33 \u2227 \u03b34 and, thus,\n[123|4] |= \u2227\ni\u2208N\n( (\u2203\u0302i \u03b3i) \u2192 \u03b3i ) .\nNow recall that for partition \u03c0 = [1|23|4] player 2\u2019s goal is not satisfied and that she cannot deviate and join another coalition to make this happen. In this case, \u03c0|\u22122 = {{1}, {3}, {4}}. Moreover, \u03c0[2 \u2192 {1}] = [12|3|4], \u03c0[2 \u2192 {3}] = [1|23|4], and \u03c0[2 \u2192 {4}] = [1|3|24]. Since, [12|3|4] 6|= \u03b32, [1|23|4] 6|= \u03b32, and [1|3|24] 6|= \u03b32, it follows that \u03c0 6|= \u2203\u03022 \u03b32. Hence, \u03c0 |= (\u2203\u03022 \u03b32) \u2192 \u03b32. Player 1, however, could deviate from \u03c02 and join {2, 3} and thus have his goal satisfied. Thus, \u03c0 is not Nash stable. Now observe that {2, 3} \u2208 \u03c0|\u22121 and that \u03c0[1 \u2192 {2, 3}] = [123|4]. Moreover, [123|4] |= \u03b31. As thus \u03c0 |= \u2203\u03021 \u03b31, also \u03c0 6|= (\u2203\u03021 \u03b31) \u2192 \u03b31. We may conclude that\n[1|23|4] 6|= \u2227\ni\u2208N\n( (\u2203\u0302i \u03b3i) \u2192 \u03b3i ) .\nNash stable partitions are not guaranteed to exist in Boolean hedonic games. The two-player game ({1, 2}, 12,\u00ac21) witnesses this fact, as can easily be appreciated. The translation into a SAT instance gives us a way to compute all Nash stable partitions of a given Boolean hedonic game. Recall, however, that the size of \u2203\u0302i \u03b3i is generally exponential in the size of \u03b3i.\nCore and strict core stability Core and strict core stability relate to group deviations much in the same way as Nash stability relates to individual deviations. Group deviations we characterised in Section 5. We thus find that Lemma 2 yields a straightforward characterisation in our logic of a specific group blocking or weakly blocking a given partition.\nProposition 7 Let (N, \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3n) be a Boolean hedonic game and T a group of players, and \u03c0 be a partition. Let, furthermore, ~\u0131 a fixed enumeration of VT and ~b the corresponding T -separating Boolean vector. Then,\n(i) T blocks \u03c0 if and only if \u03c0 |= \u2227\ni\u2208T\n( \u00ac\u03b3i \u2227 (\u03b3i)~\u0131\u2190~b ) ,\n(ii) T weakly blocks \u03c0 if and only if\n\u03c0 |= \u2227\nj\u2208T\n( \u03b3j \u2192 (\u03b3j)~\u0131\u2190~b ) \u2227 \u2228\ni\u2208T\n( \u00ac\u03b3i \u2227 (\u03b3i)~\u0131\u2190~b ) .\nProof: We give the proof for (i), as the one for (ii) runs along analogous lines. Consider the following equivalences, of which the third one follows immediately from Lemma 2.\nT blocks \u03c0 iff for all i \u2208 T : \u03c0[T \u2192 \u2205] Pi \u03c0\niff for all i \u2208 T : \u03c0[T \u2192 \u2205] |= \u03b3i and \u03c0 6|= \u03b3i\niff for all i \u2208 T : \u03c0 |= (\u03b3i)~\u0131\u2190~b and \u03c0 6|= \u03b3i iff \u03c0 |= \u2227\ni\u2208T\n( \u00ac\u03b3i \u2227 (\u03b3i)~\u0131\u2190~b ) .\nThis concludes the proof. \u2737\nObserve that the size of \u2227\ni\u2208T\n( \u00ac\u03b3i \u2227 (\u03b3i)~\u0131\u2190~b )\nis obviously polynomial in \u2211\ni\u2208T |\u03b3i| and, hence, a partition \u03c0 being blocking by particular group T of players can be polynomially characterised. It might also be worth observing that this characterisation is reminiscent of that for individual rationality and, surprisingly, much more so than of the one for Nash stability.\nAs a corollary of Proposition 7 and de Morgan laws, we obtain the following characterisations of a partition being core stable and of a partition being strict core stable. The characterisations, however, involve a conjunctions over all groups of players and as such is not polynomial.\nCorollary 1 Let (N, \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3n) be a Boolean hedonic game and \u03c0 be a partition. Let for each coalition T , ~\u0131 be an enumeration of VT and ~b the corresponding T -separating Boolean vector. Then,\n(i) \u03c0 is core stable if and only if \u03c0 |= \u2227\nT\u2286N\n\u2228\ni\u2208T\n( (\u03b3i)~\u0131\u2190~b \u2192 \u03b3i ) ,\n(ii) Then, \u03c0 is strict core stable if and only if\n\u03c0 |= \u2227\nT\u2286N\n(\n\u2228\nj\u2208T\n(\u03b3j \u2227 \u00ac(\u03b3j)~\u0131\u2190~b) \u2228 \u2227\ni\u2208T\n((\u03b3i)~\u0131\u2190~b \u2192 \u03b3i) ) .\nAlthough core stable coalition structure are not guaranteed to exist in general hedonic games, the restriction to dichotomous preferences allows us to derive this positive result.\nProposition 8 For every Boolean hedonic game, a core stable coalition structure is guaranteed to exist.\nProof: We initialise N \u2032 to N and partition \u03c0 to {\u2205}. We find a maximal subset of S \u2282 N \u2032 for which all players are in an approved coalition that satisfies their formulas. We modify \u03c0 to \u03c0 \u222a{S} and N \u2032 to N \u2032 \\S. The procedure is repeated until no such maximal subset S exists. If N \u2032 6= \u2205, then \u03c0 is set to \u03c0 \u222a {{i} : i \u2208 N \u2032}.\nWe now argue that \u03c0 is core stable. We note that each player who was in some subset S will never be part of a blocking coalition. If N \u2032 was non-empty in the last iteration, then no subset of players in N \u2032 can form a deviating coalition among themselves. \u2737\nBy contrast, a strict core stable partition is not guaranteed to exist. To see this consider the three-player Boolean hedonic game ({1, 2, 3}, 12, 21\u2228 23, 32). It is not hard to see that each of the five possible partitions is weakly blocked by either {1, 2} or {2, 3}.\nEnvy-freeness Recall that a partition is envy-free if no player would strictly prefer to exchange places with another player. Observe that for the trivial partitions \u03c00 = [1 | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |n] and \u03c01 = [1, . . . , n], we have \u03c00[i \u21c6 j] = \u03c00 and \u03c01[i \u21c6 j] = \u03c01 for all players i and j. Accordingly \u03c00 and \u03c01 are envy-free. Envy-free partitions are thus guaranteed to exist in our setting. The following lemma allows us to derive a polynomial characterisation of envy-freeness.\nLemma 3 Let (N, \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3n) be a Boolean hedonic game and i and j players in N , and \u03d5 a formula in LN . Fix, furthermore, an enumeration k1, . . . , kn\u22122 of N \\ {i, j} and let i~k = ik1, . . . , ikn\u22122 and j~k = jk1, . . . , jkn\u22122 enumerate Vi \\ {ij} and Vj \\ {ji}, respectively. Then,\n\u03c0 |= \u03d5 i~k,j~k\u2190j~k,i~k if and only if \u03c0[i \u21c6 j] |= \u03d5.\nProof: With i~k and j~k being fixed we write \u03d5\u2032 for \u03d5 i~k,j~k\u2190j~k,i~k . The proof is then by induction on \u03d5. For the basis, let \u03d5 = lm. There are three possibilities:\n(a) lm = ij, (b) lm \u2208 (Vi \u222a Vj) \\ {ij}, and (c) lm /\u2208 Vi \u222a Vj .\nIf (a), we have that lm\u2032 = ij\u2032 = ij = lm. Now, either \u03c0(i) = \u03c0(j) or \u03c0(i) 6= \u03c0(j). If the former, \u03c0[i \u21c6 j] = \u03c0 as well as both \u03c0 |= ij\u2032 and \u03c0[i \u21c6 j] |= ij. If the latter, however, it can easily be seen that both \u03c0 6|= ij\u2032 and \u03c0[i \u21c6 j] 6|= ij.\nFor case (b), we may assume without loss of generality that lm = ik for some k 6= j. Then, ik\u2032 = jk. In case \u03c0(i) = \u03c0(j), obviously, \u03c0 = \u03c0[i \u21c6 j] as well as k \u2208 \u03c0(i) if and only if k \u2208 \u03c0(j). Hence, \u03c0 |= ik\u2032 if and only if \u03c0[i \u21c6 j] |= ik. So, assume \u03c0(i) 6= \u03c0(j). Now, either (i) k \u2208 \u03c0(i) and k /\u2208 \u03c0(j), (ii) k /\u2208 \u03c0(k) and k \u2208 \u03c0(j), or (iii) k /\u2208 \u03c0(i) and k /\u2208 \u03c0(j). If (i), \u03c0 |= ik\u2032 as well as \u03c0[i \u21c6 j] |= jk. In cases (ii) and (iii), we have \u03c0 6|= ik\u2032 and \u03c0[i \u21c6 j] 6|= jk.\nFinally, if (c), we have lm\u2032 = lm. As l,m /\u2208 {i, j}, it can then easily be seen that \u03c0 |= lm\u2032 if and only if \u03c0[i \u21c6 j] |= lm.\nThe cases \u03d5 = \u00ac\u03c8 and \u03d5 = \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c7 follow by induction. \u2737\nWe are now in a position to state the following result.\nProposition 9 Let (N, \u03b31, . . . , \u03b3n) be a Boolean hedonic game. Furthermore, for every two players, i and j, and enumeration k1, . . . , kn\u22122 of N \\ {i, j}, let i~k = ik1, . . . , ikn\u22122 and j~k = jk1, . . . , jkn\u22122 enumerate Vi \\ {ij} and Vj \\ {ij}, respectively. Then,\n\u03c0 is envy-free if and only if \u03c0 |= \u2227\ni,j\u2208N\n( (\u03b3i)i~k,j~k\u2190j~k,i~k \u2192 \u03b3i ) .\nProof: By virtue of Lemma 3, the following equivalences hold:\n\u03c0 is envy-free\niff for all i, j \u2208 N : \u03c0 Ri \u03c0[i \u21c6 j]\niff for all i, j \u2208 N : \u03c0[i \u21c6 j] |= \u03b3i implies \u03c0 |= \u03b3i\niff for all i, j \u2208 N : \u03c0 |= (\u03b3i)i~k,j~k\u2190j~k,i~k implies \u03c0 |= \u03b3i iff for all i, j \u2208 N : \u03c0 |= (\u03b3i)i~k,j~k\u2190j~k,i~k \u2192 \u03b3i iff \u03c0 |= \u2227\ni,j\u2208N\n( (\u03b3i)i~k,j~k\u2190j~k,i~k \u2192 \u03b3i )\nThis concludes the proof. \u2737\nObserve that the size of \u2227\ni,j\u2208N\n( (\u03b3i)i~k,j~k\u2190j~k,i~k \u2192 \u03b3i )\nis clearly polynomial in \u2211\ni\u2208T |\u03b3i|. Hence, a partition \u03c0 being envy-free can be polynomially characterised.\nExample 1 (continued) Recall that \u03b33 = (31 \u2228 32) \u2227 \u00ac34 and that player 3 envies player 4 if partition \u03c0\u2032 = [1|24|3] obtains. To see how this is reflected by Proposition 9, let 31, 32 and 41, 42 enumerate V3 \\ {34} and V4 \\ {43}, respectively. Then,\n((31 \u2228 32) \u2227 \u00ac34)31,32,41,42\u219041,42,31,32 = (41 \u2228 42) \u2227 \u00ac34.\nNow, both \u03c0\u2032 |= (41 \u2228 42) \u2227 \u00ac34 and \u03c0\u2032 6|= (31 \u2228 32) \u2227 \u00ac34, and, hence, \u03c0\u2032 6|= (\u03b33)34,31,32\u219043,41,42 \u2192 \u03b33."}, {"heading": "7 Related Work and Conclusions", "text": "Our motivation and approach is strongly reminiscent of the setting of Boolean games in the context of non-cooperative game theory (Harrenstein et al., 2001). A major difference with Boolean games and propositional hedonic games is that in Boolean games, players have preferences over outcomes, where an outcome is a truth assignment to outcome variables, and each outcome variable is controlled by a specific player. This control assignment function, which is a central notion in Boolean games, has no counterpart here, where the outcome is a partition of the players. However, there are technical similarities with and conceptual connections to Boolean games, especially when characterising solution concepts. For instance, the characterisation of Nash stable partitions by propositional formulas (Section 4) is similar to the characterisation of Nash equilibria by propositional formulas in Boolean games as by Bonzon et al. (2009). The basic Boolean games model of Harrenstein et al. (2001) was adapted to the setting of cooperative games by Dunne et al. (2008). However, the logic used to specific player\u2019s goals in the work of Dunne et al. was not intended for specifying desirable coalition structures, as we have done in the present paper.\nOur work also shares some common ground with the work of Bonzon et al. (2012), who study the formation of efficient coalitions in Boolean games, that is, coalitions whose joint abilities allow their members to jointly achieve their goals. Our work also bears some resemblance to the work of Elkind and Wooldridge (2009), who were interested in using logic as a foundation upon which to build a compact representation scheme for hedonic games; more precisely, their work made use of weighted Boolean formulas, and was inspired by themarginal contribution nets representation for cooperative games in characteristic function form proposed byIeong and Shoham (2005). The focus of Elkind and Wooldridge (2009), however, was more on complexity issues than in finding exact characterisations for solution concepts.\nFinally, our work contributes to the extensive literature on compact representations for cooperative games, which has expanded rapidly over the past decade (Chalkiadakis et al., 2011).\nOur characterisations of solution concepts enable to compute, using an offthe-shelf SAT solver, a partition or all partitions satisfying a solution concept or a logical combination of solution concepts. Of course, this translation is interesting only when we cannot do better. For instance, for solution concepts\nleading to a polynomial characterisation, we cannot do better if and only if the corresponding decision problem is NP-complete. Identifying the complexity of finding partitions satisfying solution concepts for Boolean hedonic games is therefore the most immediate direction of further research.\nThere are at least three more directions in which our work might be further developed. First, we could think of relaxing our restriction to dichotomous preferences and study more general hedonic games with compact logical representations and derive exact characterisations of solution concepts. There are several ways in which more general preferences can be incorporated in our logical framework for hedonic games. For instance, instead of a single goal, we could associate with each player a prioritised set of goals. The different possibilities in this respect, however, vary in their level of sophistication. For some of the cruder extensions our results extend naturally and straightforwardly. For the more sophisticated settings more research seems to be required, which falls beyond the scope of this paper.\nSecond, our restriction to hedonic preferences can also be relaxed, so that players may have preferences that do depend not only on on the coalition to which they belong. This would also pave the way to a more general logic of coalition structures. Solution concepts, once generalised, can hopefully be characterised. (We have positive preliminary results that go into this direction).\nA third topic of future research would be the characterisation of classes of hedonic and coalition formation games in our logic. As mentioned above, various classes of hedonic games that allow for a concise representation have been proposed in the literature. It would be interesting to see whether these classes can also be polynomially characterised in our logic.\nAcknowledgments The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees of LOFT 2014 for their constructive comments.
