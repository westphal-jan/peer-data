\u00a0in \u00a0 computer-\u2010assisted \u00a0coding \u00a0becomes \u00a0especially \u00a0acute \u00a0with \u00a0the \u00a0introduction \u00a0of \u00a0ICD-\u201010 \u00a0 and \u00a0the

\u00a0ICD-\u201010 \u00a0presents \u00a0unprecedented \u00a0challenges \u00a0for \u00a0developers \u00a0 of \u00a0rule-\u2010based \u00a0auto-\u2010coding \u00a0software. \u00a0In \u00a0turn, \u00a0statistical \u00a0auto-\u2010coding \u00a0methods \u00a0are \u00a0 constrained \u00a0by \u00a0the \u00a0scarcity \u00a0of \u00a0available \u00a0training \u00a0data \u00a0with \u00a0human-\u2010assigned \u00a0ICD-\u201010 \u00a0 codes. \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 The \u00a0present \u00a0study \u00a0concentrates \u00a0on \u00a0a \u00a0particular \u00a0challenge \u00a0common \u00a0to \u00a0all \u00a0auto-\u2010coding \u00a0 algorithms, \u00a0regardless \u00a0of \u00a0the \u00a0code \u00a0set \u00a0they \u00a0work \u00a0with: \u00a0how \u00a0to \u00a0take \u00a0into

\u00a0the \u00a0codes \u00a0independently \u00a0of \u00a0one \u00a0another, \u00a0but \u00a0this \u00a0often \u00a0leads \u00a0to \u00a0errors, \u00a0 since \u00a0the \u00a0practical \u00a0restrictions \u00a0on \u00a0possible \u00a0code \u00a0combinations \u00a0are \u00a0ignored. \u00a0For \u00a0 example, \u00a0the \u00a0ICD-\u201010-\u2010PCS \u00a0codes \u00a0for \u00a0hip \u00a0replacement \u00a0contain \u00a0a \u00a0character \u00a0 representing \u00a0the \u00a0material \u00a0the \u00a0prosthesis \u00a0is \u00a0made \u00a0of \u00a0(unspecified, \u00a0metal, \u00a0ceramic, \u00a0 etc.) \u00a0In \u00a0practice, \u00a0only \u00a0one \u00a0of \u00a0these \u00a0options \u00a0can \u00a0apply \u00a0in \u00a0a \u00a0given \u00a0case, \u00a0but \u00a0an \u00a0auto-\u2010 coder \u00a0that \u00a0ignores \u00a0relationships \u00a0between \u00a0codes \u00a0can \u00a0easily \u00a0generate \u00a0more \u00a0than \u00a0one \u00a0 of \u00a0these \u00a0codes, \u00a0simply \u00a0because \u00a0the \u00a0right \u00a0choice \u00a0can \u00a0be \u00a0difficult \u00a0to \u00a0infer \u00a0from \u00a0the \u00a0 clinical \u00a0narrative. \u00a0Cases \u00a0like \u00a0these \u00a0could \u00a0be \u00a0handled \u00a0by \u00a0applying \u00a0rule-\u2010based \u00a0logic \u00a0to \u00a0 the \u00a0output \u00a0of \u00a0the \u00a0auto-\u2010coder. \u00a0However,

\u00a0procedures \u00a0are \u00a0often \u00a0but \u00a0not \u00a0 always \u00a0performed \u00a0together, \u00a0while \u00a0others \u00a0could \u00a0only \u00a0appear \u00a0in \u00a0the \u00a0same

\u00a0propensities \u00a0cannot \u00a0be \u00a0reliably \u00a0encoded \u00a0by \u00a0rules, \u00a0but \u00a0they \u00a0are \u00a0a \u00a0natural \u00a0 fit \u00a0for \u00a0statistical \u00a0methods. \u00a0This \u00a0is \u00a0especially \u00a0the \u00a0case \u00a0when \u00a0the \u00a0primary \u00a0auto-\u2010coder \u00a0 itself \u00a0utilizes \u00a0statistical \u00a0methods, \u00a0so \u00a0that
