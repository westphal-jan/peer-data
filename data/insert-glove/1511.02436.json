For example, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) screening tools use series of questions to assess different cognitive abilities [3]. Since MCI causes deterioration of nerve cells that control cognitive, speech, and language processes [4, 5], linguistic impairments from verbal utterances could indicate signs of MCI [6, 7, 8]. In [9], complex syntactic features were used to distinguish between 37 patients with MCI and 37 healthy control group. Seven statistically significant \u2018immediate logic memory\u2019 linguistic features were combined with several test scores to achieve 86.1% AUC. In contrast, we distinguished MCI patients using several skip-grams alone [10]. The skip-grams are capable of representing the MCI patients\u2019 language space due to the lexical and syntactic errors that are commonly observed in their language. Thus, we introduce an extensive use of word skip-grams to predicting MCI."}, {"heading": "2 Learning linguistic skip-gram biomarkers", "text": "Skip-grams are commonly used in statistical language models for natural language processing (NLP) problems such as speech processing [10]. Unlike the ordinary n-grams, word tokens are skipped intermittently while creating the n-grams. For instance, in the sentence \u201ctake the Cookie Jar\u201d, there are three conventional bigrams: \u201ctake the\u201d, \u201cthe Cookie\u201d, and \u201cCookie Jar\u201d. With skip-gram, one might skip one word intermittently for creating additional bigrams, which include \u201ctake Cookie\u201d, and \u201cthe jar\u201d. We believe such skip-grams could capture unique linguistic biomarkers in verbal utterances. Thus, we used a compound of skip-grams to effectively distinguish the MCI patients from their healthy control individuals. For each sentence S = {w1...wm} in a verbal dialogue, we define k-skip-n-grams as a set of n-gram tokens\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n02 43\n6v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\nTn\u2212gram = {wa, ..., wa+n\u2212k, ..., wa+n, ..., wm\u2212n, ..., w(m\u2212n)+n\u2212k, ..., wm}, where n is the specified n-gram (e.g. 2 for bigram and 3 for trigram), m is the number of word tokens in S, k is the number of word skip between n-grams given that k < m, and a = {1, ...,m \u2212 n}. Thus for the sentence \u201ctake the Cookie Jar from the cabinet\u201d, 1-skip-2-grams will give {\u2018take Cookie\u2019, \u2018the jar\u2019, \u2018Cookie from\u2019, \u2018jar the\u2019, \u2018from cabinet\u2019} and 1-skip-3-grams will produce {\u2018take Cookie Jar\u2019, \u2018take the Jar\u2019, \u2018the Jar from\u2019, \u2018the Cookie from\u2019, \u2018Cookie Jar the\u2019, \u2018Cookie from the\u2019, \u2018Jar the cabinet\u2019, \u2018Jar from cabinet\u2019}."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments and Results", "text": "The DementiaBank1 clinical dataset was used. The dataset contains English language transcripts of multiple verbal interviews, where MCI and Control participants described the Cookie-Theft picture component of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination [11]. Thus, we extracted a combination of skip-grams features from the transcript files of the \u2018last\u2019 interview with the participants. There are 19 MCI patients with an approximate age range of 49 to 90 years. Similarly, we selected an equivalent 19 healthy control individuals from the dataset with an approximate age range of 46 to 81 years. We identified hyperparameters using Auto-Weka [12] for four WEKA2 ML algorithms (i.e. SVM, Na\u0131\u0308ve Bayes, Decision Trees, and Logistic). A separate validation set of transcript files from the \u2018second to the last\u2019 visits to the participants were used to find hyperparameters. The validation set has 8 patients with MCI and Control, respectively, using the top 1000 skip-gram features only. As baseline, we implemented all the \u20187 Wechsler Logical Memory I\u2019 significant features in [9], which includes Words per clause, Part-Of-Speech cross entropy, content density, Standard Pause Rate, Total Phonation Time, Phonation Rate, and Transformed Phonation Rate. The Wechsler Logical Memory I is a narrative memory task, which required the subjects to listen to a story and then recall everything they can from the story. That task allowed the subjects to formulate original language structures on their own, which helps to captured both linguistic and memory deficiencies from the subjects by using various language and speech measures. Similarly, we believe that the CookieTheft picture description task captured various linguistic deficiencies, which can be detected by a compound of skip-grams. Figures 1-5 show the accuracy with different top skip-gram features. Table 1 compares our models with the baseline using the weighted Precision, Recall, F-measure, and AUC from 10-fold cross-validation on top 200 combined skip-grams.\n100 250 400 550 700 850 1000\n4 0\n6 0\n8 0\n1 0\n0\nTop 1000 1\u2212skip\u22122\u2212grams\nA c\nc u\nra c y\n(% )\nSVM NB DT Logit\nFigure 1: 1-skip-2-grams. 100 250 400 550 700 850 1000\n4 0\n6 0\n8 0\n1 0\n0\nTop 1000 1\u2212skip\u22123\u2212grams\nA c\nc u\nra c y\n(% )\nSVM NB DT Logit\nFigure 2: 1-skip-3-grams. 100 250 400 550 700 850 1000\n4 0\n6 0\n8 0\n1 0\n0\nTop 1000 2\u2212skip\u22122\u2212grams\nA c\nc u\nra c y\n(% )\nSVM NB DT Logit\nFigure 3: 2-skip-2-grams.\nConclusion and Future Work Our results show that linguistic skip-grams could help the diagnosis of MCI. However, these skipgram features are likely to be limited to the description of the Cookie-Theft picture alone. We plan to conduct further clinical evaluations with leave-pair-out cross-validation and evaluate our models against the MMSE and MoCA on actual MCI patients in the future."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was partially funded by the Tropical Medicine and Biology Multidisciplinary Research Platform of Monash University Malaysia and the Malaysian Ministry of Education Fundamental Research Grant Scheme(FRGS) - FRGS/2/2014/ICT07/ MUSM/03/1.
