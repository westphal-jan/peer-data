The goal of the decision maker is to draw arms so as to maximize the total reward\n\u2211T t=1 rt obtained.\nThis problem is a model for many applications where there is a need for trading-off exploration and exploitation. This occurs because we only see the reward of the arm we pull. An example is clinical trials, where arms correspond to different treatments or tests, and the goal can be to maximise the number of cured patients over time while being uncertain about the effects of treatments. Other problems, such as search engine advertisement and movie recommendations can be formalised similarly (Pandey and Olston 2006).\nIt has been previously noted (Jain, Kothari, and Thakurta 2012; Thakurta and Smith 2013; Mishra and Thakurta 2015; Zhao et al. 2014) that privacy is an important consideration for many multi-armed bandit applications. Indeed, privacy can be easily violated by observing changes in\nCopyright c\u00a9 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

This has been demonstrated for recommender systems such as Amazon by (Calandrino et al. 2011) and for user-targeted advertising such as Facebook by (Korolova 2010). In both cases, with a moderate amount of side information and by tracking changes in the output of the system, it was possible to learn private information of any targeted user.\nDifferential privacy (DP) (Dwork 2006) provides an answer to this privacy issue by making the output of an algorithm almost insensitive to any single user information. That is, no matter what side information is available to an outside observer, he can not have more information about a user than he already had by observing the outputs released by the algorithm. This goal is achieved by formally bounding the loss in privacy through the use of two parameters (\u01eb, \u03b4) as shown in Definition 2.1.\nFor bandit problems, differential privacy implies that the actions taken by the bandit algorithm do not reveal information about the sequence of rewards obtained. In the context of clinical trials and diagnostic tests, it guarantees that even an adversary with arbitrary side information, such as the identity of each patient, cannot learn anything from the output of the learning algorithm about patient history, condition, or test results."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related Work", "text": "Differential privacy (DP) was introduced by (Dwork et al. 2006); a good overview is given in (Dwork and Roth 2013). While initially the focus in DP was static databases, interest in its relation to online learning problems has increased recently. In the full information setting, (Jain, Kothari, and Thakurta 2012) obtained differentially private algorithms with near-optimal bounds. In the bandit setting, (Thakurta and Smith 2013) were the first to present a differentially private algorithm, for the adversarial case, while (Zhao et al. 2014) present an application to smart grids in this setting. Then, (Mishra and Thakurta 2015) provided a differentially private algorithm for the stochastic bandit problem. Their algorithms are based on two non private stochastic bandit algorithms: Upper Confidence Bound (UCB, (Auer, Cesa-Bianchi, and Fischer 2002)) and Thompson sampling (Thompson 1933). Their results are sub-optimal: although sim-\nple index-based algorithms achieving O(log T ) regret exist (Burnetas and Katehakis 1996; Auer, Cesa-Bianchi, and Fischer 2002), these differentially private algorithms additional poly-log terms in time T , as well further linear terms in the number of arms compared to the non-private optimal regret O(log T ).\nWe provide a significantly different and improved UCBstyle algorithm whose regret only adds a constant, privacydependent term to the optimal. We also improve upon previous algorithms by relaxing the need to know the horizon T ahead of time, and as a result we obtain a uniform bound. Finally, we also obtain significantly improved bounds for a variant of the original algorithm of (Mishra and Thakurta 2015), by using a different proof technique and confidence intervals.

At each time step t, the player selects an action at = i \u2208 A and obtains a reward rt \u2208 [0, 1]. The reward rt is drawn from some fixed but unknown distribution Pi such that E(rt | at) = \u00b5i. The goal of the decision maker is to draw arms so as to maximize the total reward obtained after T interactions. An equivalent notion is to minimize the total regret against an agent who knew the arm with the maximum expectation before the game starts and always plays it.

In the context of our setup, the algorithm\u2019s input is the sequence of rewards, and its output the actions. Consequently, we use the following definition of differentially private bandit algorithms.\nDefinition 2.1 ((\u01eb, \u03b4)-differentially private bandit algorithm). A bandit algorithm \u03c0 is (\u01eb, \u03b4)-differentially private if for all sequences r1:t\u22121 and r\u20321:t\u22121 that differs in at most one time step, we have for all S \u2286 A: \u03c0(at \u2208 S | a1:t\u22121, r1:t\u22121) \u2264 \u03c0(at \u2208 S | a1:t\u22121, r\u20321:t\u22121)e\u01eb+\u03b4 where A is the set of actions. When \u03b4 = 0, the algorithm is said to be \u01eb-differential private.\nIntuitively, this means that changing any reward rt for a given arm, will not change too much the best arm released at time t or later on. If each rt is a private information or a point associated to a single individual, then the definition aboves means that the presence or absence of that individual will not affect too much the output of the algorithm. Hence, the algorithm will not reveal any extra information about this individual leading to a privacy protection. The privacy parameters (\u01eb, \u03b4) determines the extent to which an individual entry affects the output; lower values of (\u01eb, \u03b4) imply higher levels of privacy.\nA natural way to obtain privacy is to add a noise such as Laplace noise (Lap ) to the output of the algorithm. The main challenge is how to get the maximum privacy while adding a minimum amount of noise as possible. This leads to a trade off between privacy and utility. In our paper, we demonstrated how to optimally trade-off this two notions."}, {"heading": "2.3 Hybrid Mechanism", "text": "The hybrid mechanism is an online algorithm used to continually release the sum of some statistics while preserving differential privacy. More formally, there is a stream \u03c3t = r1, r2 . . . rt of statistics with ri in [0, 1]. At each time step t a new statistic rt is given. The goal is to output the partial sum (yt = \u2211t i=1 ri) of the statistics from time step 1 to t without compromising privacy of the statistics. In other words, we wish to find a randomised mechanism M(yt | \u03c3t, y1:t\u22121) that is (\u01eb, \u03b4)-differential private.\nThe hybrid mechanism solves this problem by combining the Logarithm and Binary Noisy Sum mechanisms. Whenever t = 2k for some integer k, it uses the Logarithm mechanism to release a noisy sum by adding Laplace noise of scale \u01eb\u22121. It then builds a binary tree B, which is used to release noisy sums until t = 2k+1 via the Binary mechanism.\nThis uses the leaf nodes of B to store the inputs ri, while all other nodes store partial sums, with the root containing the sum from 2k to 2k+1 \u2212 1. Since the tree depth is logarithmic, there is only a logarithmic amount of noise added for any given sum, more specifically Laplace noise of scale log t\u01eb and mean 0 which is denoted by Lap( log t\u01eb ).\n(Chan, Shi, and Song 2010) proves that the hybrid mechanism is \u01eb-differential private for any n where n is the number of statistics seen so far. They also show that with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b3, the error in the released sum is upper bounded by 1\u01eb log( 1 \u03b3 ) log\n1.5 n. In this paper, we derived and used a tighter bound for this same mechanism (see Appendix in Supplementary Material) which is:\n\u221a 8\n\u01eb log(\n4 \u03b3 ) log n+\n\u221a 8\n\u01eb log(\n4 \u03b3 ) (2.2)"}, {"heading": "3 Private Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits", "text": "We describe here the general technique used by our algorithms to obtain differential privacy. Our algorithms are based on the non-private UCB algorithm by (Auer, Cesa-Bianchi, and Fischer 2002). At each time step, UCB based its action according to an optimistic estimate of the expected reward of each arm. This estimate is the sum of the empirical mean and an upper bound confidence equal to \u221a\n2 log t na,t where t is the time step and na,t the number of\ntimes arm a has been played till time t. We can observe that the only quantity using the value of the reward is the empirical mean. To achieve differential privacy, it is enough to make the player based its action on differentially private empirical means for each arm. This is so, because, once the mean of each arm is computed, the action which will be played is a deterministic function of the means. In particular, we can see the differentially private mechanism as a black box, which keeps track of the vector of non-private empirical means Y for the player, and outputs a vector of private empirical means X . This is then used by the player to select an action, as shown in Figure 1.\nWe provide three different algorithms that use different techniques to privately compute the mean and calculate the index of each arm. The first, DP-UCB-BOUND, employs the Hybrid mechanism to compute a private mean and then adds a suitable term to the confidence bound to take into account the additional uncertainty due to privacy. The second, DP-UCB employs the same mechanism, but in such a way so as all arms have the same privacy-induced uncertainty; consequently the algorithm then uses the same index as standard UCB. The final one, employs a mechanism that only releases a new mean once at the beginning of each interval. This allows us to obtain the optimal regret rate."}, {"heading": "3.1 The DP-UCB-BOUND Algorithm", "text": "In Algorithm 1, we compute the sum of the rewards of each arm using the hybrid mechanism (Chan, Shi, and Song 2010).

This makes it difficult to identify the best arms. To solve this issue, we add a tight upper bound defined in equation (2.2) on the noise added by the hybrid mechanism.\nTheorem 3.2 validates this choice by showing that only O(\u01eb\u22121 log log t) factors are added to the optimal non private regret. In theorem 3.1, we demonstrate that Algorithm 1 is indeed \u01eb-differential private.\nTheorem 3.1. Algorithm 1 is \u01eb-differential private after any number of t of plays.\nProof. This follows directly from the fact that the hybrid mechanism is \u01eb-DP after any number t of plays and a single flip of one reward in the sequence of rewards only affect one mechanism. Furthermore, the whole algorithm is a random mapping from the output of the hybrid mechanism to the action taken and using Proposition 2.1 of\n(Dwork and Roth 2013) completes the proof.\nTheorem 3.2 gives the regret for algorithm 1. While here we give only a sketch proof, the complete derivation can be found in the supplementary material (Tossou and Dimitrakakis 2016).\nTheorem 3.2. If Algorithm 1 is run with K arms having arbitrary reward distributions, then, its expected regret R after any number t of plays is bounded by:\nR \u2264 \u2211\na:\u00b5a<\u00b5\u2217\nmax\n(\nB (lnB + 7) , 8\n\u03bb20\u2206a log t\n)\n+ \u2211\na:\u00b5a<\u00b5\u2217\n(\n\u2206a + 2\u03c02\u2206a\n3\n)\n(3.1)\nB =\n\u221a 8\n\u01eb(1\u2212 \u03bb0) \u00b7 ln(4t4)\nfor any \u03bb0 such that 0 < \u03bb0 < 1 where \u00b51, . . . , \u00b5K are the expected values of P1, . . . , PK and \u2206a = \u00b5\u2217 \u2212 \u00b5a. Proof Sketch. We used the bound on the hybrid mechanism defined in equation 2.2 together with the union and Chernoff-Hoeffding bounds. We then select the error probability \u03b3 at each step to be t\u22124. This leads to a transcendental inequality solved using the Lambert W function and approximated using section 3.1 of (Barry et al. 2000)."}, {"heading": "3.2 The DP-UCB Algorithm", "text": "The key observation used in Algorithm 2 is that if at each time step we insert a reward to all hybrid mechanisms, then the scale of the noise will be the same. This means that there is no need anymore to compensate an additional bound. More precisely, every time we play an arm at = a and receive the reward rt, we not only add it to the hybrid mechanism corresponding to arm a but we also add a reward of 0 to the hybrid mechanism of all other arms. As these calculate a sum, it doesn\u2019t affect subsequent calculations.\nTheorem 3.3 shows the validity of this approach by demonstrating a regret bound with only an additional factor of O(\u01eb\u22122 log2 log t) to the optimal non private regret.\nAlgorithm 2 DP-UCB\nRun Algorithm 1 and set \u03bda to 0 When arm at = a is played, insert 0 to all hybrid mechanisms corresponding to arm a\u2032 6= a (Do not increase na\u2032,t)\nTheorem 3.3.

The proof is similar to the one for Theorem 3.2, but we have to choose the error probability to be t\u22123.5."}, {"heading": "3.3 The DP-UCB-INT Algorithm", "text": "Both Algorithms 1 and 2 enjoy a logarithmic regret with only a small additional factor in the time step t to the optimal non-private regret. However, this includes a multiplicative factor of \u01eb\u22121 and \u01eb\u22122 respectively. Consequently, increasing privacy scales the total regret proportionally. A natural question is whether or not it is possible to get a differentially private algorithm with only an additive constant to the optimal regret. Algorithm 3 answers positively to this question by using novel tricks to achieve differential privacy. Looking at regret analysis of Algorithms 1 and 2, we observe that by adding noise proportional to \u01eb, we will get a multiplicative factor to the optimal. In other words, to remove this factor, the noise should not depend on \u01eb. But how can we get \u01eb-DP in this case?\nNote that if we compute and use the mean at each time step with an \u01eb\u2032na,t-DP algorithm, then after time step t, our overall privacy is roughly the sum E \u2032 of all \u01eb\u2032na,t . We then change the algorithm so that it only uses a released mean once every 1\u01eb times, making privacy \u01ebE \u2032. In any case, \u01eb\u2032na,t needs to decrease, at least as n\u22121a,t , for the sum to be bounded by logna,t. However, \u01eb\u2032na,t should also be big enough such that the noise added keeps the UCB confidence interval used at the same order, otherwise, the regret will be higher.\nA natural choice for \u01eb\u2032na,t is a p-series. Indeed, by mak-\ning \u01eb\u2032na,t to be of the form 1\nn v/2 a,t\n, where na,t is the num-\nber of times action a has been played until time t, its sum will converge to the Riemann zeta function when v is appropriately chosen. This choice of \u01eb\u2032na,t leads to the addition of a Laplace noise of scale 1\nn 1\u2212v/2 a,t\nto the mean (See\nLemma 3.1). Now our trade-off issue between high privacy and low regret is just reduced into choosing a correct value for v. Indeed, we can pick v > 2, for the privacy to converge; but the noise added at each time step will be increasing and greater than the UCB bound; which is not desirable. To overcome this issue, we used the more sophisticated k-fold adaptive composition theorem (III-3 in (Dwork, Rothblum, and Vadhan 2010)). Roughly speaking, this theorem shows that our overall privacy after releasing the mean a number of times depends on the sum of the square of each individual privacy parameter \u01eb\u2032na,t . So, v > 1 is enough for convergence and with v \u2264 1.5, the noise added will be decreasing and will eventually become lower than the UCB bound.\nIn summary, we just need to lazily update the mean of each arm every 1\u01eb times. However, we show that the interval of release is much better than 1\u01eb and follows a series f as defined by Lemma (B.1) in the supplements\n(Tossou and Dimitrakakis 2016). Algorithm 3 summarizes the idea developed in this section.\nThe next lemma establishes the privacy \u01eb\u2032 each time a new mean is released for a given arm a.\nAlgorithm 3 DP-UCB-INT (\u01eb, v, K , A) Input \u01eb \u2208 (0, 1] v \u2208 (1, 1.5]; privacy rate.

We begin by using similar observations as in Theorem 3.1. Then, we compute the privacy of the mean of an arm using the k-fold adaptive composition theorem in (Dwork, Rothblum, and Vadhan 2010) (see the supplements (Tossou and Dimitrakakis 2016)).\nThe next corollary gives a nicer closed form for the privacy parameter which is needed in practice.\nCorollary 3.1.

The proof is obtained by inverting the term using the Riemann zeta function in corollary 3.1.\nFinally, we present the regret of Algorithm 3 in theorem 3.5 . A simple observation shows us that it has the same regret as the non private UCB with just an additive constant.\nTheorem 3.5.

More precisely, f0 is the first value of the series f defined in Lemma B.1 in the supplements (Tossou and Dimitrakakis 2016).\nSketch. This is proven using a Laplace concentration inequality to bound the estimate of the mean then we selected the error probability to be t\u22123.5."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "We perform experiments using arms with rewards drawn from independent Bernoulli distribution. The plot, in logarithmic scale, shows the regret of the algorithms over 100, 000 time steps averaged over 100 runs. We targeted 2 different \u01eb privacy levels : 0.1 and 1. For DP-UCB-INT, we pick \u01eb such that the overall privacy is (\u01eb\u2032, \u03b4\u2032)-DP with \u01eb as defined in corollary 3.2 and \u03b4\u2032 = e\u221210, \u01eb\u2032 \u2208 {0.1, 1}, v = 1.1. We put in parenthesis the input privacy of each algorithm.\nWe compared against the non private UCB algorithm and the algorithm presented in (Mishra and Thakurta 2015) (Private-UCB ) with a failure probability chosen to be t\u22124.\nWe perform two scenarios. Firstly we used two arms: one with expectation 0.9 and the other 0.6. The second scenario is a more challenging one with 10 arms having all an expectation of 0.1 except two with 0.55 and 0.2.\nAs expected, the performance of DP-UCB-INT is significantly better than all other private algorithms. More importantly, the gap between the regret of DP-UCB-INT and the non private UCB does not increase with time confirming the theoretical regret. We can notice that DP-UCB is better than DP-UCB-BOUND for small time steps. However, as the time step increases DP-UCB-BOUND outperforms DPUCB and eventually catches its regret. The reason for that is: DP-UCB spends less time to distinguish between arms with close rewards due to the fact that the additional factor\nin its regret depends on \u2206a = \u00b5\u2217 \u2212\u00b5a which is not the case for DP-UCB. Private-UCB performs worse than all other algorithms which is not surprising.\nMoreover, we noticed that the difference between the best regret (after 100 runs) and worst regret is very consistent for all ours algorithms and the non private UCB (it is under 664.5 for the 2 arms scenario). However, this gap reaches 30, 000 for Private-UCB. This means that our algorithms are able to correctly trade-off between exploration and exploitation which is not the case for Private-UCB."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed and analysed differentially private algorithms for the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, significantly improving upon the state of the art. The first two, (DP-UCB and DP-UCBBOUND) are variants of an existing private UCB algorithm (Mishra and Thakurta 2015), while the third one uses an interval-based mechanism.\nThose first two algorithms are only within a factor of O(\u01eb\u22121 log log t) and O(\u01eb\u22122 log2 log t) to the non-private algorithm. The last algorithm, DP-UCB-INT, efficiently trades off the privacy level and the regret and is able to achieve the same regret as the non-private algorithm up to an additional additive constant. This has been achieved by using two key tricks: updating the mean of each arm lazily with a frequency proportional to the privacy \u01eb\u22121 and adding a noise independent of \u01eb. Intuitively, the algorithm achieves better privacy without increasing regret, because its output is less dependent on individual reward.\nPerhaps it is possible to improve our bounds further if we are willing to settle for asymptotically low regret (Cowan and Katehakis 2015). A natural future work is to study if we can use similar methods for other mechanisms such as Thompson sampling (known to be differentially private (Dimitrakakis et al. 2014)) instead of UCB. Another question is whether a similar analysis can be performed for adversarial bandits.\nWe would also like to connect more to applications by two extensions of our algorithms. The first natural extension is to consider some side-information. In the drug testing example, this could include some information about the drug, the test performed and the user examined or treated. The second extension would relate to generalising the notion of neighbouring databases to take into account the fact that multiple observations in the sequence (say m) can be associated with a single individual. Our algorithms can be easily extended to deal with this setting (by re-scaling the privacy parameter to \u01eb m ). However, in practice, m could be quite large and it will be an interesting future work to check if we could get sub linearity in the parameter m under certain conditions."}, {"heading": "A Collected proofs", "text": ""}, {"heading": "A.1 Proof of Theorem 3.2", "text": "a will be used to indicate the index of an arm. \u01eb is the differential privacy parameter. t is used to denote the time step.\nFrom Lemma (B.2), we know that the error between the empirical and private mean is bounded as |Y \u2212X | \u2264 hn with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b3, X is the empirical mean returned by the private mechanism, Y the true empirical mean, hn the error due to the differentially private mechanism.

So, we should multiply na by f which cancel out the effect of the division.\nIn summary, (and similarly to Theorem 3.2)\nTa(s) \u2264 f0 + \u2308 max ( ( 2\u2212\n\u221a 3.5\n3.5 \u221a 2 log t ) 2\nv\u22121 , 8\n\u22062a log t\n)\u2309\n+\n\u221e \u2211\nt=1\nt\u22121 \u2211\nn=1\nt\u22121 \u2211\nna=\u2113\n4t\u22123.5\n\u2264 f0 + \u2308 8\n\u22062a log t\n\u2309\n+\n\u221e \u2211\nt=1\n4t\u22121.5\n\u2264 f0 + 1 + 8\n\u22062a log t+ 4\u03b6(1.5)\n\u2264 f0 + 1 + 8\n\u22062a log t+ 4\u03b6(1.5) (B.21)\nLemma B.2 (Improved (Chan, Shi, and Song 2010) bound). For any \u03b3 \u2264 n\u2212b, where b > 0, Chan\u2019s hybrid mechanism is \u01eb-differential private and has an error bounded with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b3 by \u221a 8 \u01eb log( 4 \u03b3 ) logn+ \u221a 8 \u01eb log( 4 \u03b3 ).\nProof. Our improvement is based on two observations. Firstly, if \u03b3 \u2264 n\u2212b then we can use the alternative concentration bound for the sum of the Laplace distribution. Secondly, we note that given all the previous released sums, the current sum is only drawn from one of the two mechanisms. Thus there is no need to apply a composition theorem."}], "references": [{"title": "Finite time analysis of the multiarmed bandit problem.
