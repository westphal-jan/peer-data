The 55 functions are derived from combining a subset of the 24 well-known single-objective functions of the bbob test suite [HAN2009] which has been used since 2009 in the BBOB workshop series. While concrete details on each of the 55 bbob-biobj functions are given in Section The bbob-biobj Test Functions and Their Properties, we will detail here the main rationale behind them together with their common properties.\n2.1 The Single-objective bbob Functions\nThe bbob-biobj test suite is designed to be able to assess performance of algorithms with respect to well-identified difficulties in optimization typically occurring in real-world problems. A\nmulti-objective problem being a combination of single-objective problems, one can obtain multiobjective problems with representative difficulties by simply combining single objective functions with representative difficulties observed in real-world problems. For this purpose we naturally use the single-objective bbob suite [HAN2009].\nCombining all 24 bbob functions in pairs thereby results in 242 = 576 bi-objective functions overall. We however assume that multi-objective optimization algorithms are not sensitive to permutations of the objective functions such that combining the 24 bbob functions and taking out the function (\ud835\udc542, \ud835\udc541) if the function (\ud835\udc541, \ud835\udc542) is present results in 24 + (\ufe00 24 2 )\ufe00 = 24 + (24 \u00d7 23)/2 = (24\u00d7 25)/2 = 300 functions.\nSome first tests, e.g. in [BRO2015], showed that having 300 functions is impracticable in terms of the overall running time of the benchmarking experiment. We then decided to exploit the organization of the bbob functions into classes to choose a subset of functions. More precisely, the 24 original bbob functions are grouped into five function classes where each class gathers functions with similar properties, namely\n1. separable functions\n2. functions with low or moderate conditioning\n3. functions with high conditioning and unimodal\n4. multi-modal functions with adequate global structure,\n5. multi-modal functions with weak global structure.\nTo create the bbob-biobj suite, we choose two functions within each class. This way we do not introduce any bias towards a specific class. In addition within each class, the functions are chosen to be the most representative without repeating similar functions. For example, only one Ellipsoid, one Rastrigin, and one Gallagher function are included in the bbob-biobj suite although they appear in separate versions in the bbob suite. Finally our choice of 10 bbob functions for creating the bbob-biobj test suite is the following:\n\u2022 Separable functions\n\u2013 Sphere (function 1 in bbob suite)\n\u2013 Ellipsoid separable (function 2 in bbob suite)\n\u2022 Functions with low or moderate conditioning\n\u2013 Attractive sector (function 6 in bbob suite)\n\u2013 Rosenbrock original (function 8 in bbob suite)\n\u2022 Functions with high conditioning and unimodal\n\u2013 Sharp ridge (function 13 in bbob suite)\n\u2013 Sum of different powers (function 14 in bbob suite)\n\u2022 Multi-modal functions with adequate global structure\n\u2013 Rastrigin (function 15 in bbob suite)\n\u2013 Schaffer F7, condition 10 (function 17 in bbob suite)\n\u2022 Multi-modal functions with weak global structure\n\u2013 Schwefel x*sin(x) (function 20 in bbob suite)\n\u2013 Gallagher 101 peaks (function 21 in bbob suite) Using the above described pairwise combinations, this results in having 10+ (\ufe00 10 2 )\ufe00 = 55 bi-objective functions in the final bbob-biobj suite. These functions are denoted \ud835\udc531 to \ud835\udc5355 in the sequel."}, {"heading": "2.2 Function Groups", "text": "From combining the original bbob function classes, we obtain 15 function classes to structure the 55 bi-objective functions of the bbob-biobj test suite.

Typically, different orders of magnitude between the objective values can be observed.\nHowever, to facilitate comparison of algorithm performance over different functions, we normalize the objectives based on the ideal and nadir points before calculating the hypervolume indicator [BRO2016biperf]. Both points can be computed, because the global optimum is known and is unique for the 10 bbob base functions. In the black-box optimization benchmarking setup, however, the values of the ideal and nadir points are not accessible to the optimization algorithm [HAN2016ex]."}, {"heading": "2.4 Instances", "text": "Our test functions are parametrized and instances are instantiations of the underlying parameters (see [HAN2016co]). The instances for the bi-objective functions are using instances of each single objective function composing the bi-objective one. In addition, we assert two conditions:\n1. The Euclidean distance between the two single-objective optima (also called the extreme optimal points) in the search space is at least 10\u22124.\n2. The Euclidean distance between the ideal and the nadir point in the non-normalized objective space is at least 10\u22121.\nWe associate to an instance, an instance-id which is an integer. The relation between the instanceid, \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc53id, of a bi-objective function \ud835\udc53 = (\ud835\udc53\ud835\udefc, \ud835\udc53\ud835\udefd) and the instance-ids, \ud835\udc3e \ud835\udc53\ud835\udefc id and \ud835\udc3e \ud835\udc53\ud835\udefd id , of its underlying single-objective functions \ud835\udc53\ud835\udefc and \ud835\udc53\ud835\udefd is the following:\n\u2022 \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc53\ud835\udefcid = 2\ud835\udc3e \ud835\udc53 id + 1 and\n\u2022 \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc53\ud835\udefdid = \ud835\udc3e \ud835\udc53\ud835\udefc id + 1\nIf we find that above conditions are not satisfied for all dimensions and functions in the bbob-biobj suite, we increase the instance-id of the second objective successively until both properties are fulfilled. For example, the bbob-biobj instance-id 8 corresponds to the instanceid 17 for the first objective and instance-id 18 for the second objective while for the bbob-biobj instance-id 9, the first instance-id is 19 but for the second objective, instance-id 21 is chosen instead of instance-id 20.\nExceptions to the above rule are, for historical reasons, the bbob-biobj instance-ids 1 and 2 in order to match the instance-ids 1 to 5 with the ones proposed in [BRO2015]. The bbob-biobj instance-id 1 contains the single-objective instance-ids 2 and 4 and the bbob-biobj instance-id 2 contains the two instance-ids 3 and 5.\nFor each bi-objective function and given dimension, the bbob-biobj suite contains 10 instances.2\n3 The bbob-biobj Test Functions and Their Properties\nIn the following, we detail all 55 bbob-biobj functions and their properties.\nThe following table gives an overview and quick access to the functions, inner cell IDs refer to the bbob-biobj functions, outer column and row annotations refer to the single-objective bbob functions.\n\ud835\udc531 \ud835\udc532 \ud835\udc536 \ud835\udc538 \ud835\udc5313 \ud835\udc5314 \ud835\udc5315 \ud835\udc5317 \ud835\udc5320 \ud835\udc5321 \ud835\udc531 f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 f8 f9 f10 \ud835\udc532 f11 f12 f13 f14 f15 f16 f17 f18 f19 \ud835\udc536 f20 f21 f22 f23 f24 f25 f26 f27 \ud835\udc538 f28 f29 f30 f31 f32 f33 f34 \ud835\udc5313 f35 f36 f37 f38 f39 f40 \ud835\udc5314 f41 f42 f43 f44 f45 \ud835\udc5315 f46 f47 f48 f49 \ud835\udc5317 f50 f51 f52 \ud835\udc5320 f53 f54 \ud835\udc5321 f55"}, {"heading": "3.1 Some Function Properties", "text": "In the description of the 55 bbob-biobj functions below, several general properties of objective functions will be mentioned that are defined here in short. It depends on these properties whether the optimization problem is easy or hard to solve.\nA separable function does not show any dependencies between the variables and can therefore be solved by applying \ud835\udc37 consecutive one-dimensional optimizations along the coordinate axes while keeping the other variables fixed. Consequently, non-separable problems must be considered. They are much more difficult to solve. The typical well-established technique to generate nonseparable functions from separable ones is the application of a rotation matrix R to \ud835\udc65, that is \ud835\udc65 \u2208 R\ud835\udc37 \u21a6\u2192 \ud835\udc54(R\ud835\udc65), where \ud835\udc54 is a separable function.\nA unimodal function has only one local minimum which is at the same time also its global one. A multimodal function has at least two local minima which is highly common in practical optimization problems.\n2 In principle, as for the instance generation for the bbob suite, the number of possible instances for the bbob-biobj suite is unlimited [HAN2016co]. However, running some tests with too few instances will render the potential statistics and their interpretation problematic while even the tiniest observed difference can be made statistically significant with a high enough number of instances. A good compromise to avoid either pitfall seems to lie between, say, 9 and 19 instances.\nIll-conditioning is another typical challenge in real-parameter optimization and, besides multimodality, probably the most common one. In a general case, we can consider a function as illconditioned if for solution points from the same level-set \u201cthe minimal displacement [...] that produces a given function value improvement differs by orders of magnitude\u201d [HAN2011]. Conditioning can be rigorously formalized in the case of convex quadratic functions, \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) = 1\n2 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc65\nwhere \ud835\udc3b is a symmetric positive definite matrix, as the condition number of the Hessian matrix \ud835\udc3b . Since contour lines associated to a convex quadratic function are ellipsoids, the condition number corresponds to the square root of the ratio between the largest axis of the ellipsoid and the shortest axis.\nThe proposed bbob-biobj testbed contains ill-conditioned functions with a typical conditioning of 106. We believe this is a realistic requirement, while we have seen practical problems with conditioning as large as 1010."}, {"heading": "3.2 Domain Bounds", "text": "All bi-objective functions provided in the bbob-biobj suite are unbounded, i.e., defined on the entire real-valued space R\ud835\udc37.
