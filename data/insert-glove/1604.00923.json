Introduction", "text": "The ability to predict the performance of a policy without actually having to use it is crucial to the responsible use of reinforcement learning algorithms. Consider the setting where the user of a reinforcement learning algorithm has already deployed some policy, e.g., for determining which advertisement to show a user visiting a website (Theocharous et al., 2015), for determining which medical treatment to suggest for a patient (Thapa et al., 2005), or for suggesting a personalized curriculum for a student (Mandel et al., 2014). In these examples, using a bad policy can be costly or dangerous, so it is important that the user of a reinforcement learning algorithm be able to accurately predict how well a new policy will perform without having to deploy it.\nIn this paper we propose a new algorithm for tackling this performance prediction problem, which is called the offpolicy policy evaluation (OPE) problem. The primary objective in OPE problems is to produce estimates that minimize some notion of error. We select mean squared error, a\npopular notion of error for estimators, as our loss function. This is in line with previous works that all use (root) mean squared error when empirically validating their methods (Precup et al., 2000; Dud\u0131\u0301k et al., 2011; Mahmood et al., 2014; Thomas, 2015b; Jiang & Li, 2015).\nGiven this goal, an estimator should be strongly consistent\u2014its mean squared error should converge almost surely to zero as the amount of available data increases.1 In this paper we introduce a new strongly consistent estimator, MAGIC, that directly optimizes mean squared error. Our empirical results show that MAGIC can produce estimates with orders of magnitude lower mean squared error than the estimates produced by existing algorithms.\nOur new algorithm comes from the synthesis of two new contributions. The first contribution is an extension of the recently proposed doubly robust (DR) OPE algorithm (Jiang & Li, 2015). We present a novel derivation of their algorithm that removes the assumption that the horizon is finite and known. We also give conditions under which the DR estimator is strongly consistent. We then show how we can significantly reduce the variance of the DR estimator by introducing a small amount of bias\u2014an effective tradeoff when attempting to minimize the mean squared error of the estimates. We call our extension of the DR estimator the weighted doubly robust (WDR) estimator.\nOur second major contribution is a new estimator, which we call the blending IS and model (BIM) estimator, that combines two different OPE estimators not just by selecting between them, but by blending them together in a way that minimizes the mean squared error. The combination of these two contributions results in a particularly powerful new OPE algorithm that we call the model and guided importance sampling combining (MAGIC) estimator, which uses BIM to combine a purely model-based estimator with WDR. In our simulations, MAGIC has the best general per-\n1A formal definition of what it means for an estimator to be strongly consistent is provided in Appendix A, where, in Lemma 3, we also elucidate the relationship between strong consistency and mean squared error.\nar X\niv :1\n60 4.\n00 92\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 4\nA pr\n2 01\nformance, often exhibiting orders of magnitude lower mean squared error than prior state-of-the-art estimators."}, {"heading": "2. Notation", "text": "We assume that the reader is familiar with reinforcement learning (Sutton & Barto, 1998) and adopt notational standard MDPNv1 for Markov decision processes (Thomas, 2015a, MDPs). For simplicity, our notation assumes that the state, action, and reward sets are finite, although our results carry over to more general settings.2 Let H := (S0, A0, R0, S1, . . . ) be a trajectory,3\nand g(H) := \u2211\u221e\nt=0 \u03b3 tRt denote the return of a trajec-\ntory. We assume that the (possibly unknown) minimum and maximum rewards, rmin and rmax, are finite and that \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1] for the finite-horizon setting and \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1) for the indefinite and infinite horizon settings so that g(H) is bounded. We use the discounted objective function, v(\u03c0) := E[g(H)|H \u223c \u03c0], where H \u223c \u03c0 denotes that H was generated using the policy \u03c0. When dealing with multiple trajectories, we use superscripts to denote which trajectory a term comes from. For example, we write SHt to denote the state at time t during trajectory H . Let v\u03c0 and q\u03c0 be the state value function and state-action value function for policy \u03c0\u2014for all (\u03c0, s, a) \u2208 \u03a0 \u00d7 S \u00d7 A, let v\u03c0(s) := E [ \u2211\u221e t=0 \u03b3\ntRt|S0 = s, \u03c0] and q\u03c0(s, a) := E [ \u2211\u221e\nt=0 \u03b3 tRt|S0 = s,A0 = a, \u03c0]. Notice that v without\na superscript denotes the objective function, while v\u03c0 denotes a value function.\nWe will assume that historical data, D, is provided. Formally this historical data is a set of n \u2208 N>0 trajectories and the known policies, called behavior policies, that were used to generate them. That is, D := {(Hi, \u03c0i)}ni=1, where Hi \u223c \u03c0i. Importantly, when we write Hi, we always mean that Hi \u223c \u03c0i. Let \u03c1t(H,\u03c0e, \u03c0b) := \u220ft i=0 \u03c0e ( AHi \u2223\u2223SHi ) /\u03c0b ( AHi \u2223\u2223SHi ) , be an importance weight, which is the probability of the first t steps of H under the evaluation policy, \u03c0e, divided by its probability under the behavior policy \u03c0b (Precup et al., 2000, Section 2). For brevity, we write \u03c1it as shorthand for \u03c1t(Hi, \u03c0e, \u03c0i) and \u03c1t as shorthand for \u03c1t(H,\u03c0e, \u03c0b). To\n2We have verified that our results carry over to the setting where the states, actions, and rewards are continuous random variables with density functions. This result is relatively straightforward\u2014summations are replaced with integrals, probability mass functions with probability density functions, and probabilities with probability densities, where appropriate. We have included Assumption 4, which is implied when the setting is restricted to finite state, action, and reward sets, since it is necessary for the continuous setting. We have not verified our results for the setting where the states, actions, and rewards come from distributions that do not have probability mass or density functions, e.g., if the rewards come from the Cantor distribution.\n3For alliteration, one might think ofH as denoting the history of an episode.\nsimplify later expressions, let \u03c1i\u22121 := 1 for all i. One of the primary challenges will be to combat the high variance and large range of the importance weights, \u03c1t.\nSome of the methods that we describe use an approximate model of an MDP. Let r\u0302\u03c0(s, a, t) denote the model\u2019s prediction of the reward t steps later, Rt, if S0 = s, A0 = a, and the policy \u03c0 is used to generate the subsequent actions, A1, A2, . . . . For example, r\u0302\u03c0(s, a, 0) is a prediction of the immediate reward after taking action a in state s and is thus the same for all policies, \u03c0. We assume that these predictions are bounded by finite (possibly unknown) constants rmodelmin and r model max , i.e., r\u0302 \u03c0(s, a, t) \u2208 [rmodelmin , rmodelmax ]. Let\nr\u0302\u03c0(s, t) := \u2211\na\u2208A \u03c0(a|s)r\u0302\u03c0(s, a, t), (1)\nbe a prediction of Rt if S0 = s and the policy \u03c0 is used to generate actions A0, A1, . . . , for all (s, t, \u03c0) \u2208 S \u00d7 N\u22650 \u00d7 \u03a0. Let v\u0302\u03c0(s) := \u2211\u221e t=0 \u03b3\ntr\u0302\u03c0(s, t) and q\u0302\u03c0(s, a) :=\u2211\u221e t=0 \u03b3\ntr\u0302\u03c0(s, a, t) be the model\u2019s estimates of v\u03c0(s) and q\u03c0(s, a). We assume that if a terminal absorbing state, \u221e s , is reached, the model\u2019s predictions of rewards that occur thereafter are always zero: r\u0302\u03c0( \u221e s , a, t) = 0 for all (\u03c0, a, t) \u2208 \u03a0 \u00d7 A \u00d7 N\u22650. Although better models will tend to improve our estimates, we make no assumptions about the veracity of the approximate model\u2019s predictions, r\u0302\u03c0(s, a, t)."}, {"heading": "3. Off-Policy Policy Evaluation (OPE)", "text": "The problem of off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) is defined as follows. We are given an evaluation policy, \u03c0e, historical data, D, and an approximate model.

(2016)."}, {"heading": "4. Doubly Robust (DR) Estimator", "text": "The doubly robust (DR) estimator (Jiang & Li, 2015) is a new unbiased estimator of v(\u03c0e) that achieves promising empirical and theoretical results by leveraging an approximate model of an MDP to decrease the variance of the unbiased estimates produced by ordinary importance sam-\npling (Precup et al., 2000). It is doubly robust in that it will provide \u201cgood\u201d estimates if either 1) the model is accurate or 2) the behavior policies are known. By \u201cgood\u201d it is meant that if the former does not hold then the estimator will remain unbiased (although it might have high variance and thus high mean squared error), and if the latter does not hold then if the model has low error the doubly robust estimator will also tend to have low error. Doubly robust estimators were introduced and remain popular in the statistics community (Rotnitzky & Robins, 1995; Heejung & Robins, 2005).\nThe work that introduced the DR estimator for MDPs (Jiang & Li, 2015) derived it as a generalization of a doubly robust estimator for bandits (Dud\u0131\u0301k et al., 2011). This may be why the DR estimator was derived only for the finite horizon setting where the horizon is known (every trajectory must terminate within L < \u221e time steps, and L must be known). It also resulted in a recursive definition of the DR estimator that can be difficult to interpret. In Appendix B we instead derive the DR estimator for MDPs as an application of control variates. Our new derivation holds without assumptions on the horizon and gives the intuitive non-recursive definition, where wit = \u03c1 i t/n:\nDR(D) := n\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3twitR Hi t (2)\n\u2212 n\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t ( witq\u0302 \u03c0e ( SHit , A Hi t ) \u2212 wit\u22121v\u0302\u03c0e ( SHit )) .\nIn Appendix B we show that this definition is equivalent to that of Jiang & Li (2015) when the horizon is finite and known, and we provide several new theoretical results pertaining to the DR estimator. Specifically, we give conditions for DR to be an unbiased estimator without assumptions on the horizon, and we give the first proofs that it is a strongly consistent estimator. Although these are important properties to establish, we relegate them to an appendix due to space limitations.\nThe non-recursive definition of the DR estimator presented in (2) also reveals the close relationship of the DR estimator to advantage sum estimators. Advantage sum estimators were introduced as a way to lower the variance of on-policy Monte Carlo performance estimates for a setting that is a generalization of the (partially observable) MDP setting (Zinkevich et al., 2006; White & Bowling, 2009). The DR estimator for the on-policy setting can be found in the work of Zinkevich et al. (2006, Equation 8). One may therefore view the DR estimator (Jiang & Li, 2015) as the extension of the advantage sum estimator (Zinkevich et al., 2006) to the off-policy setting or as the extension of the doubly robust estimator for bandits (Dud\u0131\u0301k et al., 2011) to the sequential setting. We are therefore not the first to\nshow that the DR estimator can be viewed as an application of control variates, since Veness et al. (2011, Section 3.1) point out that the advantage sum estimator is an application of control variates. Still, our derivation in Appendix B of the DR estimator is novel.\nThe DR estimator is not purely model based, since it uses importance weights. However, it is also not a model-free importance sampling method, since it uses an approximate model to decrease the variance of its estimates. We therefore refer to it as a guided importance sampling method, since the approximate model is used to guide, but not completely replace, the importance sampling estimates."}, {"heading": "5. Weighted Doubly Robust (WDR) Estimator", "text": "Empirical and theoretical results show that the DR estimator developed, analyzed, and tested by Jiang & Li (2015) can significantly reduce the variance of ordinary importance sampling without introducing bias. The fact that it does not introduce bias can be particularly important when the estimator is used to produce confidence bounds on v(\u03c0e) (Thomas, 2015b). However, in practice these confidence bounds often require an impractical amount of data before they are tight enough to be useful, and so approximate confidence bounds (e.g., bootstrap confidence bounds) are used instead (Theocharous et al., 2015; Thomas, 2015b). When using these approximate confidence bounds, the strict requirement that an OPE estimator be an unbiased estimator of v(\u03c0e) is not necessary. Furthermore, often the goal of OPE is not to produce confidence bounds, but to produce the best estimate of v(\u03c0e) possible, in order to determine whether \u03c0e should be used instead of the current behavior policy or as an internal mechanism in a policy search algorithm (Levine & Koltun, 2013). In these cases, the \u201cbest\u201d estimator is typically defined as the one that has the lowest mean squared error (MSE). For example, in their experiments, Precup et al. (2000), Dud\u0131\u0301k et al. (2011), Mahmood et al. (2014), Thomas (2015b), and Jiang & Li (2015) all use the (root) MSE when evaluating OPE methods.\nAlthough unbiasedness might seem like a desirable property of an estimator, when the goal is to minimize MSE, it often is not. In general, the MSE of an estimator, \u03b8\u0302, of a statistic, \u03b8, can be decomposed into its variance and its squared bias: MSE(\u03b8\u0302, \u03b8) = E[(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u0302)2] = Var(\u03b8\u0302) + Bias(\u03b8\u0302)2, where Bias(\u03b8\u0302) := E[\u03b8\u0302] \u2212 \u03b8. The optimal estimator in terms of MSE is typically one that balances this bias-variance trade-off, not one with zero bias. Therefore, in the context of minimizing MSE, strong asymptotic consistency, which requires the MSE of an estimator to almost surely converge to zero as the amount of available data increases, is a more desirable property than unbiasedness.\nIn this section we propose a new OPE estimator that we call the weighted doubly robust (WDR) estimator. The WDR estimator comes from applying a simple well-known extension to importance sampling estimators to the DR estimator to produce a new guided importance sampling method. This extension does not directly optimize the bias-variance trade-off, but it does tend to significantly better balance it while maintaining asymptotic consistency. More specifically, WDR is based on weighted importance sampling (Powell & Swann, 1966) as opposed to ordinary importance sampling (Hammersley & Handscomb, 1964). For further discussion of the benefits of weighted importance sampling over ordinary importance sampling, see the work of Thomas (2015b, Section 3.8). Weighted importance sampling has been used before for OPE (Precup et al., 2000), but not in conjunction with the DR estimator.\nOur WDR estimator is defined as the DR estimator in (2), except where wit := \u03c1 i t/ \u2211n j=1 \u03c1 j t . 4 Intuitively it is clear that this estimator is asymptotically correct because E[\u03c1jt ] = 1, and so by the law of large numbers the denominator of wit will converge to n. Although WDR is not an unbiased estimator of v(\u03c0e), its bias follows a pattern that is both predictable and also sometimes desirable. When there is only a single trajectory, i.e., n = 1, WDR(D) is an unbiased estimator of the performance of the behavior policy, since w1t = 1 for all t. If there is a single behavior policy, \u03c0b, as the number of trajectories increases, the expected value ofWDR(D) shifts away from v(\u03c0b) towards v(\u03c0e).\nBefore presenting theoretical results about the WDR estimator, we introduce assumptions that they will require. These assumptions are only included if they are explicitly mentioned in a theorem\u2014most theorems only rely on few of these assumptions. Even when these assumptions are not satisfied, it does not mean that the result does not hold or that the WDR estimator will perform poorly\u2014it merely means that the theoretical results that we provide are not guaranteed by our proofs.\nAssumption 1 ensures that all trajectories of interest when evaluating \u03c0e will be produced by all of the behavior policies. This is a standard assumption in OPE and typically precludes the use of deterministic behavior policies.5\nAssumption 1 (Absolute continuity). For all (s, a, i) \u2208 4Just as DR-v2 extends the DR estimator (Jiang & Li, 2015, Section 4.4), one can create the WDR-v2 estimator by replacing q\u0302\u03c0e(St, At) with r\u0302\u03c0e(St, At, 0) + \u03b3v\u0302\u03c0e(St+1) in (2). Empirical results for DR-v2 and WDR-v2 are included in the spreadsheet in the supplemental documents. For the domains presented here, these variants did not outperform the original DR and WDR estimators.\n5Assumption 1 could be replaced with a less-restrictive assumption like that used by Thomas (2015b, Section 3.5). We use Assumption 1 because it allows for simplified proofs.\nS \u00d7A\u00d7 {1, . . . , n}, if \u03c0i(a|s) = 0 then \u03c0e(a|s) = 0.\nAssumption 2 requires all of the behavior policies to be identical. This assumption is trivially satisfied if data is collected from one behavior policy. Also, this assumption is often satisfied for applications where data is abundant, so that evaluation can be performed using only the data from the most recent behavior policy. Also, Assumption 3 requires the horizon, L, to be finite.\nAssumption 2 (Single behavior policy). For all (i, j) \u2208 {1, . . . , n}2, \u03c0i = \u03c0j . Assumption 3. L is finite.\nAssumption 4 requires the importance weights, \u03c1it, to be bounded above by a finite constant, \u03b2 \u2208 R (they are always bounded below by zero). It is trivially satisfied in the common setting where the horizon is finite and the state and action sets are finite. Although Assumption 4 requires \u03b2 to exist, none of our results depend on how large \u03b2 is. So, in the non-finite state, action, and horizon settings one may ensure that evaluation policies are only considered if they satisfy Assumption 4 for some arbitrarily large \u03b2.\nAssumption 4 (Bounded importance weight). There exists a constant \u03b2 < \u221e such that for all (t, i) \u2208 N\u22650 \u00d7 {1, . . . , n}, \u03c1it \u2264 \u03b2 surely.\nIn the following theorems, Theorems 1 and 2, we give two different sets of assumptions that are sufficient to show that WDR is a strongly consistent estimator of v(\u03c0e). Notice that if the sets of states and actions are finite and the horizon is finite, then Assumption 4 holds, and so Theorem 2 means that WDR will be strongly consistent given only Assumption 1.\nTheorem 1 (WDR \u2013 strongly consistent estimator for one behavior policy, finite horizon). If Assumptions 1, 2, and 3 hold thenWDR(D) a.s.\u2212\u2192 v(\u03c0e). Proof See Appendix C.1. Theorem 2 (WDR \u2013 strongly consistent estimator for many behavior policies). If Assumptions 1 and 4 hold then WDR(D) a.s.\u2212\u2192 v(\u03c0e). Proof See Appendix C.2."}, {"heading": "6. Empirical Studies (WDR)", "text": "In order to both show the empirical benefits of WDR over existing importance sampling estimators and better motivate our second major contribution, in this section we present an empirical comparison of different OPE methods.6 We compare to a broad sampling of model-free importance sampling estimators, definitions of which can be found in the work of Thomas (2015b, Chapter 3): importance sampling (IS), per-decision importance sampling\n6The raw data for all of the plots provided in this paper (as well as additional plots) are available in the spreadsheet included in the supplemental material.\nIS PDIS WIS CWPDIS DR AM WDR\n(PDIS), weighted importance sampling (WIS), and consistent weighted per-decision importance sampling (CWPDIS). We also compare to the guided importance sampling doubly robust (DR) estimator (Jiang & Li, 2015).\nLastly, we compare to the approximate model (AM) estimator, which uses all of the available data to construct an approximate model of the MDP.7 The performance of the evaluation policy on the approximate model is typically easy to compute and can be used as an estimate of v(\u03c0e). For example, in our experiments the approximate model maintains an estimate, d\u03020, of the initial state distribution, and so we define AM := \u2211 s\u2208S d\u03020(s)v\u0302\n\u03c0e(s). Notice that unlike the importance sampling based methods, AM does not include any importance weights (\u03c1t terms).\nIn Appendix D we provide detailed descriptions of the experimental setup and results. Here we provide only an overview. We used three domains: a 4 \u00d7 4 gridworld previously constructed specifically for evaluating OPE methods (Thomas, 2015b, Section 2.5), as well as two simple domains that we developed to exemplify the settings where different methods excel and fail. In our simulations, WDR dominated the other importance sampling and guided importance sampling estimators (but not AM). Not only did WDR always achieve the lowest mean squared error of these estimators, but no other single (guided) importance sampling estimator was able to always achieve mean squared errors within an order of WDR\u2019s. Figure 1a is an example using the gridworld where no other method achieved mean squared errors within an order of WDR\u2019s.\nThe second notable trend is that WDR often significantly outperformed AM. We constructed a simple MDP and experimental setup that we callModelFail, which exemplifies this. In the ModelFail experiments, the approximate model\n7This model-based estimator has been called the direct method in previous work (Dud\u0131\u0301k et al., 2011), however, in other previous work direct methods are model-free while indirect methods are model-based (Sutton & Barto, 1998, Section 9.2).\nuses function approximation, which causes it to converge to the wrong MDP. This results in AM\u2019s mean squared error plateauing at a non-zero value, as shown in Figure 1b. Since WDR remains strongly consistent in this setting, its MSE converges almost surely to zero.\nThe third notable trend is that when an accurate approximate model is available, WDR does not always outperform AM.We constructed a simple MDP that we callModelWin, which exemplifies this. In the ModelWin MDP, the approximate model quickly converges to the correct MDP, and so AM outperforms WDR. This is depicted in Figure 1c.\nOne might wonder why DR and WDR can do worse than AM even though they incorporate the approximate model. Notice that we can write the DR and WDR estimators as:\nWDR(D) := 1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\nv\u0302\u03c0e(SHi0 )\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 (a)\n(3)\n+\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3twit [ RHit \u2212 q\u0302\u03c0e ( SHit , A Hi t ) + \u03b3v\u0302\u03c0e ( SHit+1 )\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 (b)\n] .\nIf the approximate model is perfect, then (a) is both a low variance and unbiased estimator of v(\u03c0e). If the approximate model is perfect and Rt and St+1 are deterministic functions of St and At, then (b) is zero, and so the second term is always zero andWDR is an excellent estimator. However, ifRt or St+1 is not a deterministic function of St and At\u2014if the state transitions or rewards are stochastic\u2014 then (b) is not necessarily zero. If the importance weights, wit, have high variance, then even slightly non-zero values of (b) can cause DR and WDR to have high variance.\nIn summary, in our experiments, WDR dominated the other (guided) importance sampling estimators, sometimes achieving orders of magnitude lower MSE. However, the experiments also show that WDR is not always the best\nestimator\u2014sometimes AM can produce estimates with an order lower MSE. This trend is also visible in the results of Jiang & Li (2015), where AM performs better than DR (although they did not compare to WDR, since it had not yet been introduced). Ideally we would like an estimator that combines WDR and AM or switches between them automatically, to always achieve the performance of the better estimator. In the following sections we show how this can be done."}, {"heading": "7. Blending IS and Model (BIM) Estimator", "text": "In this section we show how two OPE estimators can be merged into a single estimator that exhibits the desirable properties of both. Before doing so, we establish some terminology. We divide OPE estimators into three classes. The first class we call importance sampling estimators. We define this class to include all estimators that, when L is finite, are defined using all of the importance weights \u03c10, \u03c11, . . . , \u03c1L\u22121. Notice that this includes IS, PDIS, WIS, and CWPDIS, as well as the guided importance sampling methods, DR and WDR.\nThe second class we call purely model-based estimators. We define this class to include all estimators that do not contain any \u03c1t terms for t \u2265 0. The only purely modelbased estimator in this paper is AM. Finally, we call the third class partial importance sampling estimators. These estimators are those that do not fall into either of the other two classes\u2014estimators that use importance weights, \u03c1t, but only for t < L\u2212 1. We will introduce one such estimator later in this section.\nWe contend that importance sampling estimators and purely model-based estimators are two extremes on a spectrum of estimators. Importance sampling estimators tend to be strongly consistent. That is, as more historical data becomes available, their estimates become increasingly accurate. However, their use of importance weights means that they all (including DR and WDR) also can have high variance relative to purely model-based estimators. This is evident in the results on the ModelWin domain.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, purely model-based estimators like AM are often not strongly consistent. If the approximate model uses function approximation or if there is some partial observability, then the approximate model may not converge to the true MDP. So, as more historical data becomes available, the estimates of AMmay converge to a value other than v(\u03c0e). Thus, purely model-based estimators tend to have high bias, even asymptotically, as evidenced by the AM curve in Figure 1b. However, purely model-based methods also tend to have low variance because they do not contain any \u03c1t terms.\nBetween these two extremes lies a range of partial im-\nportance sampling estimators. Estimators that are close to the purely model-based estimators use \u03c1t terms only for small t, while estimators that are close to importance sampling estimators use \u03c1t terms with large t approaching L \u2212 1. Before formally defining one such partial importance sampling estimator, we present a few additional definitions. First, let IS(j)(D) denote an estimate of E[ \u2211j\nt=0 \u03b3 tRt|H \u223c \u03c0e], constructed from D using an im-\nportance sampling method like PDIS or WDR, which uses importance weights up to and including \u03c1t. Similarly, let AM(j)(D) denote a primarily model-based prediction from D of E[ \u2211\u221e t=j \u03b3\ntRt|H \u223c \u03c0e] that may not use \u03c1t terms with t \u2265 j. We can now define a partial importance sampling estimator that we call the off-policy j-step return, g(j)(D), which uses an importance sampling based method to predict the outcome of using \u03c0e up until Rj is generated, and the approximate model estimator to predict the outcomes thereafter. That is, for all j \u2208 N\u2265\u22121, let8\ng(j)(D) := IS(j)(D) + AM(j+1)(D)\ng(\u221e)(D) := lim j\u2192\u221e g(j)(D). (4)\nWe refer to j as the length of the j-step return.\nNotice that g(\u22121)(D) is a purely model-based estimator, g(\u221e)(D) is an importance sampling estimator, and the other off-policy j-step returns are partial importance sampling estimators that blend between these two extremes. When j is small, the off-policy j-step return is similar to AM, using importance sampling to predict only a few early rewards. When j is large, it uses importance sampling to predict most of the rewards and the model only for a few rewards at the end of a trajectory. So, as j increases, we expect the variance of the return to increase, but the bias to decrease.\nWe propose a new estimator, which we call the blending IS and model (BIM) estimator, that leverages this spectrum of estimators to blend together the IS and AM estimators in a way that minimizes MSE. It does this by computing a weighted average of the different length returns: BIM(D) := x\u22bag(D), where x := (x\u22121, x0, x1, . . . )\u22ba is an infinite-dimensional weight vector and g(D) is an infinitedimensional vector of different length returns, g(D) := (g(\u22121)(D), g(0)(D), . . . , )\u22ba. Although in theory x can be infinite, in practice there is always finite data, so x is finite. The remaining question is then: how should we select the weights, x?\nA similar question has been studied before in reinforce-\n8If prior knowledge about d0 is available, then one might consider adding g(\u22122)(D) to denote the model\u2019s prediction of v(\u03c0e), which might differ from g(\u22121)(D).\nment learning research when deciding how to weight jstep returns (not off-policy), as reviewed by Sutton & Barto (1998, Section 7.2). The most common solution, a complex return called the \u03bb-return, uses x\u22121 = 0 and xj = (1\u2212 \u03bb)\u03bbj for all other j. The \u03bb-return is the foundation of the entire TD(\u03bb) family of algorithms, which includes the original linear-time algorithm (Sutton, 1988), least-squares formulations (Bradtke & Barto, 1996; Mahmood et al., 2014), methods for adapting \u03bb (Downey & Sanner, 2010), true-online methods (van Hasselt et al., 2014), and the recent emphatic methods (Mahmood et al., 2015).\nRecent work has suggested that the \u03bb-return could be replaced by more statistically principled complex returns like the \u03b3-return (Konidaris et al., 2011) or \u2126return (Thomas et al., 2015). For the finite-horizon setting and for j \u2208 {0, . . . , L \u2212 1} the \u03b3-return uses xj := ( \u2211j i=0 \u03b3 2i))\u22121/ \u2211L\u22121 j\u0302=0 ( \u2211j\u0302 i=0 \u03b3 2i)\u22121, and the \u2126return uses xj = \u2211L\u22121 i=0 \u2126 \u22121 n (j, i)/ \u2211L\u22121 j\u0302,i=0 \u2126\u22121n (j\u0302, i), where \u2126n is the L\u00d7L covariance matrix where \u2126n(i, j) = Cov(g(i)(D), g(j)(D)), and where both the \u03b3 and \u2126returns use xj = 0 for j 6\u2208 {0, . . . , L\u2212 1}. The advantage of the \u03b3-return over the \u03bb-return is that it uses a more accurate model of how variance increases with the length of a return, which also eliminates the \u03bb hyperparameter used by the \u03bb-return. The advantages of the \u2126return over the \u03b3-return are that it both uses a yet moreaccurate estimate of how variance grows with the length of the return, which is computed from historical data, and that it better accounts for the fact that different length returns are not independent, i.e., g(i)(D) and g(j)(D) are not independent even if i 6= j. However, none of these weighting schemes are sufficient for our needs because they do not cause BIM to necessarily be a strongly consistent estimator.9 This is likely because they were all designed for the setting where only one trajectory is available, i.e., n = 1, while strong consistency is a property that deals with performance as n\u2192\u221e. Furthermore, they were designed for on-policy policy evaluation.\nWe therefore propose a new weighting scheme (a new complex return for multiple trajectories) that directly optimizes our primary objective: the mean squared error. This new weighting scheme is x\u22c6 := argminx\u2208R\u221e MSE(x\u22bag(D), v(\u03c0e)). Unfortunately, we typically cannot compute x\u22c6, because we do not know MSE(x\u22bag(D), v(\u03c0e)) for any x. Instead, we propose estimating x\u22c6 by minimizing an approximation of MSE(x\u22bag(D), v(\u03c0e)). First, dealing with an infinite number of different return lengths is challenging. To avoid this, we propose only using a subset of the returns, {g(j)(D)},\n9The \u03bb-return with \u03bb = 1 is defined to be g(\u221e)(D) and is consistent, but it does not mix the two OPE methods at all.\nfor j \u2208 J , where |J | < \u221e. For all j 6\u2208 J , we assign xj = 0. We suggest including \u22121 and\u221e in J . To simplify later notation, let gJ (D) \u2208 R|J | be the elements of g(D) whose indexes are in J\u2014the returns that will not necessarily be given weights of zero. Also let Jj denote the jth element in J . We can then estimate x\u22c6 by:\nx\u0302\u22c6 \u2208 arg min x\u2208R|J | MSE(x\u22bagJ (D), v(\u03c0e)),\nwhere our estimate of x\u22c6j is zero if j 6\u2208 J and our estimate of x\u22c6Jj is x\u0302 \u22c6 j for j \u2208 {1, . . . , |J |}.\nNext, to avoid searching all of R|J | and also to serve as a form of regularization on x\u0302\u22c6, we limit the set of x that we consider to the |J |-simplex, i.e., we require xj \u2265 0 for all j \u2208 {1, . . . , |J |} and \u2211|J |j=1 xj = 1. We write \u2206|J | to denote this set of weight vectors\u2014the |J |-simplex. Using the bias-variance decomposition of MSE, we therefore have that\nx\u0302\u22c6 \u2208 arg min x\u2208\u2206|J | Bias(x\u22bagJ (D))2 +Var(x\u22bagJ (D))\n= arg min x\u2208\u2206|J |\nx\u22ba[\u2126n + bnb\u22ban]x,\nwhere n remains the number of trajectories in D, \u2126n is the |J | \u00d7 |J | covariance matrix where \u2126n(i, j) = Cov(g(Ji)(D),g(Jj)(D)) and bn is the |J |-dimensional vector with bn(j) = E[g(Jj)(D)] \u2212 v(\u03c0e) for all j \u2208 {1, . . . , |J |}.10 This simplifies the problem of estimating the MSE for all possible x into estimating two terms: the bias vector, bn, and the covariance matrix, \u2126n.\nLet b\u0302n and \u2126\u0302n be the estimates of bn and \u2126n when there are n trajectories in D. The exact scheme used to estimate bn and \u2126n depends on the definitions of IS(j)(D) and AM(j)(D). In general, both terms are easier to estimate for unweighted importance sampling estimators like PDIS and DR than for weighted estimators like CWPDIS or WDR.\nTo make the dependence of BIM on the estimates of \u2126n and bn explicit, and to summarize the approximations we have made, we redefine the BIM estimator as:\nBIM(D, \u2126\u0302n, b\u0302n) := (x\u0302 \u22c6)\u22bagJ (D),\nwhere\nx\u0302\u22c6 \u2208 arg min x\u2208\u2206|J | x\u22ba[\u2126\u0302n + b\u0302nb\u0302\u22ban]x.\nIn the next section we propose using WDR as the importance sampling method, IS, and show how bn and \u2126n can\n10Since bn (similarly, \u2126n) already has a subscript, we write bn(j) to denote the j th element of bn.\nbe approximated in this setting. First we show that if at least one of the returns included in J is a strongly consistent estimator of v(\u03c0e), and if the estimates of bn and \u2126n are themselves strongly consistent, then BIM is a strongly consistent estimator of v(\u03c0e): Theorem 3. If Assumption 4 holds, there exists at least one j \u2208 J such that g(j)(D) is a strongly consistent estimator of v(\u03c0e), b\u0302n \u2212 bn a.s.\u2212\u2192 0, and \u2126\u0302n \u2212\u2126n a.s.\u2212\u2192 0, then BIM(D, \u2126\u0302n, b\u0302n) a.s.\u2212\u2192 v(\u03c0e).

Model and Guided Importance Sampling Combining (MAGIC) Estimator", "text": "In this section we propose using the BIM estimator with WDR as the importance sampling estimator. The resulting estimator combines purely model based estimates with the estimates of the guided importance sampling algorithm WDR, and so we call it the model and guided importance sampling combining (MAGIC) estimator.\nAlthough the derivation of how to properly define IS(j)(D) and AM(j)(D) in order to blend WDR with the approximate model is less obvious than one might expect and therefore an important technical detail, we relegate it to Appendix F due to space restrictions.

See Appendix G for details and pseudocode for MAGIC.\nEstimating the bias vector, bn, is challenging because it has a strong dependence on the value that we wish we knew, v(\u03c0e). We cannot use AM\u2019s estimate as a stand-in for v(\u03c0e) because it would cause us to assume that AM\u2019s greatest weakness\u2014its high bias\u2014is negligible. We cannot use WDR\u2019s estimate (or any other importance sampling estimator\u2019s estimate) because our estimate of bn would then conflate the high variance of importance sampling estimates with the bias that we wish to estimate.\nWhen n, the number of trajectories inD, is small, variance tends to be the root cause of high MSE. We therefore propose using an estimate of bn that is initially conservative\u2014 initially it underestimates the bias\u2014but which becomes\ncorrect as n increases. LetCI(g(\u221e)(D), \u03b4) be a 1\u2212\u03b4 confidence interval on the expected value of the random variable g(\u221e)(D) = WDR(D). Intuitively, as n increases we expect that this confidence interval will converge to g(\u221e)(D), which in turn converges to v(\u03c0e). So, we estimate bn(j), the bias of the off-policy j-step return, by its distance from the 10% confidence interval. That is, we estimate bn(j) as\nb\u0302n(j) := dist ( g(Jj)(D),CI(g(\u221e)(D), 0.5) ) ,\nwhere dist(y,Z) is the distance between y \u2208 R and the set Z \u2286 R: dist(y,Z) = minz\u2208Z |y\u2212z|.We use both the percentile bootstrap confidence interval (Efron & Tibshirani, 1993) and Chernoff-Hoeffding\u2019s inequality\u2014whichever is tighter\u2014for CI in our experiments.\nIn Theorem 4 we show that the MAGIC estimator is a strongly consistent estimator of v(\u03c0e) given one set of assumptions that we used to show that WDR is strongly consistent and that WDR is included as one of the off-policy j-step returns.\nTheorem 4 (MAGIC - strongly consistent).

Empirical Studies (MAGIC)", "text": "Appendix I provides detailed experiments using MAGIC. In this section we provide an overview of these results. The first three plots in Figure 2 correspond to those in Figure 1, but include MAGIC. In general MAGIC does very well, tracking or exceeding the best performance of WDR and AM. However, in Figure 2c MAGIC does not perfectly track AM. The scale is logarithmic, so the difference between MAGIC and AM is small in comparison to the benefit of MAGIC over WDR. We hypothesize that the reason MAGIC does not match AM may be due to error in our estimates of \u2126n and bn.\nFigure 2d is for an experimental setup that we call Hybrid, where early in trajectories there is partial observability (e.g., initial uncertainty about a student\u2019s knowledge in an intelligent tutoring system, or uncertainty about the state of the world in a robotic application). In these settings MAGIC outperforms all other estimators, even AM and WDR, by automatically leveraging WDR for the parts of trajectories where partial observability causes the model to be inaccurate, and AM for parts of the trajectories where the model is accurate. To emphasize this, we include MAGIC-B (B for binary) where J = {\u22121,\u221e}, so that BIM can only blend AM and WDR by placing weights on them.

Notice that even if \u03c1it < \u03b2, it is possible for \u03c1itR i t > \u03b2rmax if rmax is negative, since \u03c1 i t could be zero. Additionally, sometimes we may deal with rmax terms and other times rmodelmax . To avoid explicitly handling these cases, we will bound terms using loose bounds that depend on a new term: r\u22c6max := max{|rmin|, |rmax|, |rmodelmin |, |rmodelmax |}.

In order to establish this property we begin with Lebesgue\u2019s dominated convergence theorem:\nTheorem 5 (Lebesgue\u2019s Dominated Convergence Theorem).

If (Xi)\u221ei=1 is a sequence of uniformly bounded real-valued random variables and if Xn\na.s.\u2212\u2192 X , then limn\u2192\u221eE[Xn] = E[X].\nProof. Let Xn (for all n) and X be random variables on the probability space (\u2126,\u03a3, P ) and let A = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 : limn\u2192\u221eXn = X}.

For term (b), notice that for all \u03c9 \u2208 A, limn\u2192\u221eXn = X . For term (c), notice that by the assumption thatXn\na.s.\u2212\u2192 X , we have that \u2126 \\ A has measure zero. So:\nlim n\u2192\u221e E [Xn] =\n\u222b\nA XdP\n=\n\u222b\nA XdP +\n\u222b\n\u2126\\A XdP\n=E[X].\nNext we present a lemma that relates almost sure convergence of estimators to mean squared error. Let \u03b8\u0302 be an estimator of \u03b8. Recall that:\nMSE(\u03b8\u0302, \u03b8) := E [ (\u03b8\u0302 \u2212 \u03b8)2 ] .\nWe show that a sequence, (Xn)\u221en=1 converges almost surely to X if and only if limn\u2192\u221eMSE(Xn, X) = 0.\nLemma 3. If (Xi)\u221ei=1 is a sequence of uniformly bounded real-valued random variables, then Xn\na.s.\u2212\u2192 X if and only if limn\u2192\u221eMSE(Xn, X) = 0.\nProof. We show each direction separately. First we show that Xn a.s.\u2212\u2192 X implies limn\u2192\u221eMSE(Xn, X) = 0.\nMSE(Xn, X) =E[(Xn \u2212X)2] =E[Yn],\nwhere Yn := (Xn \u2212 X)2. By the continuous mapping theorem we have that Yn\na.s.\u2212\u2192 (X \u2212 X)2 = 0. So, by Lemma 2 (applied to E[Yn]) we have that\nlim n\u2192\u221e MSE(Xn, X) =E[0]\n= 0.\nNext we show the other direction: that limn\u2192\u221eMSE(Xn, X) = 0 implies Xn\na.s.\u2212\u2192 X . Let X and allXn be random variables on the probability space (\u2126,\u03a3, P ), A = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 : limn\u2192\u221eMSE(Xn, X) = 0}, and B = {\u03c9 \u2208 A : limn\u2192\u221eXn 6= X}. If limn\u2192\u221eMSE(Xn, X) = 0, then by the definition of\nMSE we have that:\n0 = lim n\u2192\u221e\n\u222b\n\u2126\n(Xn \u2212X)2 dP\n(a) =\n\u222b\n\u2126\n( lim n\u2192\u221e Xn \u2212X )2 dP\n=\n\u222b\nB\n( lim n\u2192\u221e Xn \u2212X )2\ndP \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n(b)\n+\n\u222b\nA\\B\n( lim n\u2192\u221e Xn \u2212X )2 dP\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 (c)\n+\n\u222b\n\u2126\\A\n( lim n\u2192\u221e Xn \u2212X )2 dP\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 (d)\n,\nwhere we get (a) by using the bounded convergence theorem to pass the limit inside the integral and the fact that (Xn \u2212 X)2 is a continuous function of Xn to then move the limit to the Xn term. Notice that (b), (c), and (d) are all positive, and so they must all be zero for the equality with zero to hold. We have that (d) is necessarily zero due to the definition of A and our assumption that limn\u2192\u221eMSE(Xn, X) = 0. Similarly, (c) is zero because, from the definition of B, A \\ B causes limn\u2192\u221eXn = X . However, in (b), by the definition of B, limn\u2192\u221eXn\u2212X is non-zero, and so for the equality with zero to hold, B must have measure zero. That is, Pr(limn\u2192\u221eXn 6= X) = 0, and thus Pr(limn\u2192\u221eXn = X) = 1.\nNext we show that if two sequences of random variables converge to the same random variable, then any sequence of random variables bounded between the two sequences must also converge to the same random variable.\nLemma 4. If Xn a.s.\u2212\u2192 X , Zn a.s.\u2212\u2192 X , and for all n, Xn \u2264 Yn \u2264 Zn, then Yn a.s.\u2212\u2192 X ."}, {"heading": "Proof.", "text": "Pr ( lim n\u2192\u221e Yn = X ) = Pr (( lim n\u2192\u221e Yn \u2264 X )\n(5) \u22c2(\nlim n\u2192\u221e\nYn \u2265 X ))\nSince\nPr ( lim n\u2192\u221e Yn \u2265 X ) \u2265Pr ( lim n\u2192\u221e Xn \u2265 X )\n\u2265Pr ( lim n\u2192\u221e Xn = X )\n=1,\nand\nPr ( lim n\u2192\u221e Yn \u2264 X ) \u2265Pr ( lim n\u2192\u221e Zn \u2264 X )\n\u2265Pr ( lim n\u2192\u221e Zn = X )\n=1,\nwe have that (5) is the probability of the joint occurance of two probability one events, and so\nPr ( lim n\u2192\u221e Yn = X ) = 1.\nNext we show that if the difference between two sequences converges almost surely to zero, then we can substitute one sequence for the other as an input to a continuous function without changing the almost sure convergence properties of the function: Lemma 5. If f is a continuous function, f(Xn) a.s.\u2212\u2192 X , and Yn \u2212Xn a.s.\u2212\u2192 0, then f(Yn) a.s.\u2212\u2192 X ."}, {"heading": "Proof.", "text": "Pr ( lim n\u2192\u221e f(Yn) = X ) = Pr ( lim n\u2192\u221e f(Yn \u2212Xn +Xn) = X )\n(a) =Pr ( f ( lim n\u2192\u221e Yn \u2212Xn +Xn ) = X )\n(b) \u2265Pr (( lim n\u2192\u221e Yn \u2212Xn = 0 )\n\u22c2( f ( lim n\u2192\u221e Xn ) = X\n))\n=Pr (( lim n\u2192\u221e Yn \u2212Xn = 0 )\n\u22c2( lim n\u2192\u221e f(Xn) = X ))\n(c) =1,\nwhere (a) holds because f is a continuous function, and where (b) holds because it gives sufficient conditions for the event in the line above to hold, and (c) holds because under our assumptions the two events both occur with probability one. So we can conclude that f(Yn) a.s.\u2212\u2192 X .\nNext we review two standard forms of the strong law of large numbers.\nTheorem 6 (Khintchine Strong Law of Large Numbers). Let {Xi}\u221ei=1 be independent and identically distributed random variables. Then ( 1n \u2211n i=1Xi) \u221e n=1 is a sequence of random variables that converges almost surely to E[X1].\nProof. See the work of Sen & Singer (1993, Theorem 2.3.13).\nTheorem 7 (Kolmogorov Strong Law of Large Numbers). Let {Xi}\u221ei=1 be independent (not necessarily identically distributed) random variables. If all Xi have the same mean and bounded variance (i.e., there is a finite constant b such that for all i \u2265 1, Var(Xi) \u2264 b), then ( 1n \u2211n i=1Xi) \u221e n=1 is a sequence of random variables that converges almost surely to E[X1].\nProof. See the work of Sen & Singer (1993, Theorem 2.3.10 with Proposition 2.3.10).\nIn Corollary 1 we present a simple extension of Kolmogorov\u2019s strong law of large numbers that we often still refer to as Kolmogorov\u2019s strong law of large numbers:\nCorollary 1. Let {Xi}\u221ei=1 be independent (not necessarily identically distributed) random variables. If all Xi have the same mean and are uniformly bounded by a finite constant b, then ( 1n \u2211n i=1Xi) \u221e n=1 is a sequence of random variables that converges almost surely to E[X1].\nProof. For all i \u2208 N>0 we have that |Xi| \u2264 b surely, so from Popoviciu\u2019s inequality, Var(Xi) \u2264 b2, and so we can apply Theorem 7.\nWe now turn to results that are more specific to reinforcement learning and off-policy policy evaluation. Lemma 6 establishes a relationship between the expected values of r\u0302\u03c0e(s, i) and r\u0302\u03c0e(s,A, i) for all i ifA is generated by some policy \u03c0.\nLemma 6. Let (\u03c0e, \u03c0) \u2208 \u03a02, where (\u03c0(a|s) = 0) =\u21d2 (\u03c0e(a|s) = 0) for all (a, s) \u2208 A \u00d7 S .

Let (\u03c0e, \u03c0) \u2208 \u03a02, where (\u03c0(a|s) = 0) =\u21d2 (\u03c0e(a|s) = 0) for all (a, s) \u2208 A\u00d7 S .

This lemma is the bulk of the proof that the full DR estimator is unbiased\u2014we have placed it in a separate lemma because it is also a useful result when showing that the DR estimator is strongly consistent.\nLemma 7. If Assumption 1 holds then E[DRi(D)] = v(\u03c0e) for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}.\nProof. Recall that\nDRi(D) := \u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t\u03c1itR Hi t\n\u2212 \u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t ( \u03c1itq\u0302 \u03c0e ( SHit , A Hi t ) \u2212 \u03c1it\u22121v\u0302\u03c0e ( SHit )) .\nFirst, notice that \u2211\u221e\nt=0 \u03b3 t\u03c1Hit R Hi t is the per-decision im-\nportance sampling (PDIS) estimator, which is known to be an unbiased estimator of v(\u03c0e) (Precup et al., 2000; Thomas, 2015b). So, we need only show that the remaining terms in the definition of DRi(D) have expected value zero, i.e., that\nE\n[ \u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t\u03c1itq\u0302 \u03c0e ( SHit , A Hi t )] = E [ \u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t\u03c1it\u22121v\u0302 \u03c0e ( SHit )] .\nBy Corollary 2 (which requires Assumption 1) we have that\nE\n[ \u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t\u03c1it\u22121v\u0302 \u03c0e ( SHit\n)]\n=E\n[ \u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t\u03c1it\u22121 \u03c0e\n( AHit |SHit )\n\u03c0i ( AHit |SHit\n) q\u0302\u03c0e ( SHit , A Hi t\n)]\n=E\n[ \u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t\u03c1itq\u0302 \u03c0e ( SHit , A Hi t )] .\nFor completeness, next we show formally the obvious result that Assumption 1 implies that partial trajectories that occur under the evaluation policy must occur under the behavior policy.\nLemma 8. Assumption 1 implies that if Pr(Ht=ht|\u03c0i) = 0, then Pr(Ht = ht|\u03c0e) = 0 for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, ht := (s0, a0, r0, s1, . . . , st\u22121, at\u22121, rt\u22121, st) \u2208 Ht, and 0 \u2264 t <\u221e.\nProof. If t = 0 then ht = (s0), which does not depend on the policy, so clearly if Pr(H0 = h0|\u03c0i) = 0 then Pr(H0 = h0|\u03c0e) = 0. Hereafter we assume 1 \u2264 t < \u221e. Notice that for any \u03c0 \u2208 \u03a0,\nPr(Ht=ht|\u03c0) (a) =Pr(S0=s0) Pr(A0=a0|S0 = s0, \u03c0)\n\u00d7 ( t\u22121\u220f\ni=1\nPr(Si=si|Si\u22121 = si\u22121, Ai\u22121 = ai\u22121)\n\u00d7 Pr(Ri\u22121=ri\u22121|Si\u22121=si\u22121, Ai\u22121=ai\u22121, Si=si) \u00d7 Pr(Ai=ai|Si=si, \u03c0) )\n\u00d7 Pr(St=st|St\u22121 = st\u22121, At\u22121 = at\u22121) \u00d7 Pr(Rt\u22121 = rt\u22121|St\u22121 = st\u22121, At\u22121 = at\u22121, St = st)\n(b) =d0(s0)\u03c0(a0|s0)P (st|st\u22121, at\u22121)R(rt\u22121|st\u22121, at\u22121, st)\n\u00d7 t\u22121\u220f\ni=1\nP (si|si\u22121ai\u22121)R(ri\u22121|si\u22121, ai\u22121, si)\u03c0(ai|si).\nwhere (a) comes from repeated application of the rule that, for any random variables X and Y , Pr(X = x, Y = y) = Pr(X =x) Pr(Y = y|X =x) and the Markov property for state transitions, actions, and rewards, and (b) comes from the definitions of d0, \u03c0, R and P in MDPNv1.\nSo, if Pr(Ht = ht|\u03c0i) = 0, then one of the terms in the product above (using \u03c0i for \u03c0) must be zero. If that term is not a \u03c0i term, then it also shows up in Pr(Ht = ht|\u03c0e), and so Pr(Ht = ht|\u03c0e) = 0. If the term is a \u03c0i term, then by Assumption 1, the corresponding \u03c0e term must also be zero, and so Pr(Ht = ht|\u03c0i) = 0.\nNext, recall the known result that the ratio of partial trajectory probabilities under two different policies can be written in terms of the two policies:\nLemma 9. Let \u03c0e and \u03c0b be any two policies and t \u2208 N>0. Let ht be any history of length t that has non-zero probability under \u03c0b, i.e., Pr(Ht=ht|\u03c0b) 6= 0. Then\nPr(Ht=ht|\u03c0e) Pr(Ht=ht|\u03c0b) = t\u22121\u220f\ni=0\n\u03c0e (ai|si) \u03c0b (ai|si) .\nProof. See the works of (Precup et al., 2000) or (Thomas, 2015b, Lemma 1).\nNext we establish Lemma 10, which states that we can use importance sampling to generate unbiased estimates of any function of partial trajectories in D. Recall that whenever\nwe writeHi (orHti ) we always mean a trajectory generated by \u03c0i, so Hi \u223c \u03c0i. Lemma 10.

If t = \u22121 then Ht\u22121 = (S0), which does not depend on the policy, so the result is immediate.

For all \u03c0i and t \u2208 N\u2265\u22121, if Assumption 1 holds, then E[\u03c1it] = 1.\nProof. This follows from Lemma 10 with f(Ht+1) := 1.\nNext we establish a lemma that will be crucial to showing that the WDR estimator is strongly consistent:\nLemma 12. For all t \u2208 N\u22650, let ft : Ht+1 \u2192 R. If Assumption 1 holds, ft = 0 for all t \u2208 N\u2265L, and either: \u2022 Case 1: Assumptions 2 and 3 hold.\nor \u2022 Case 2: Assumption 4 holds and there is a finite fmax such that for all t \u2208 N\u22650 and ht+1 \u2208 Ht+1, |ft(ht+1)| < fmax.\nthen \u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t n\u2211\ni=1 \u03c1it\u2211n j=1 \u03c1 j t ft(H t+1 i ) (6)\na.s.\u2212\u2192 E [ \u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3tft(H t+1) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223H \u223c \u03c0e ] .\nProof. Let\nXtn := n\u2211\ni=1 \u03c1it\u2211n j=1 \u03c1 j t \u03b3tft(H t+1 i ),\nso that the left side of (6) can be written as \u2211\u221e\nt=0X t n. First\nwe multiply the numerator and denominator ofXtn by 1 n to get:\nXtn = 1 n\n\u2211n i=1 \u03b3 t\u03c1itft(H t+1 i )\n1 n \u2211n i=1 \u03c1 i t\n. (7)\nWe will show that the numerator of (7) converges almost surely to the desired value:\n1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c1it\u03b3 tft(H t+1 i ) a.s.\u2212\u2192 E[\u03b3tft(Ht+1)|Ht+1 \u223c \u03c0e].\n(8) By Lemma 10, which relies on Assumption 1, we have that E[\u03c1it\u03b3 tft(H t+1 i )] = E[\u03b3 tft(H t+1)|Ht+1 \u223c \u03c0e]. Consider the two cases from the statement of the lemma:\n1. Case 1: Ht+1i is independent and identically distributed for all i, so \u03c1it\u03b3 tft(H t+1 i ) is also indepen-\ndent and identically distributed for all i. Therefore by Khintchine\u2019s strong law of large numbers, Theorem 6, we have (8). 2. Case 2: Ht+1i are not necessarily identically distributed since there may be multiple behavior policies, so we cannot directly apply Khintchine\u2019s strong law of large numbers. Instead notice that \u03c1it is bounded by \u03b2 due to Assumption 4, and so |\u03c1it\u03b3tft(Ht+1i )| \u2264 \u03b2\u03b3tfmax. So, we can apply Kolmogorov\u2019s strong law of large numbers, Corollary 1, to get (8).\nNext we show that the denominator of (7) converges almost surely to one:\n1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c1it a.s.\u2212\u2192 1. (9)\nBy Lemma 11, which relies on Assumption 1, we have that E[\u03c1it] = 1. Again consider the two possible settings:\n1. Case 1: Ht+1i is independent and identically distributed for all i, so \u03c1it is also independent and identically distributed for all i. Therefore by Khintchine\u2019s strong law of large numbers we have (9). 2. Case 2: Since \u03c1it \u2264 \u03b2, we can apply Kolmogorov\u2019s strong law of large numbers to get (9).\nBy applying Property 2 to (8) and (9) we have that for all t, Xtn a.s.\u2212\u2192 E [ \u03b3tft(H t+1) \u2223\u2223Ht+1 \u223c \u03c0e ] . So,\n1. Case 1: Since Xtn = 0 for t \u2265 L and by Property 3, \u221e\u2211\nt=0\nXtn = L\u22121\u2211\nt=0\nXtn\na.s.\u2212\u2192E [ L\u22121\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3tft(H t+1) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223H t+1 \u223c \u03c0e ]\n=E\n[ \u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3tft(H t+1) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223H \u223c \u03c0e ] .\n2. Case 2: In order to apply Property 4 we must show that there exists a function g : N\u22650 \u2192 R such that\u2211\u221e\nt=0 g(t) < \u221e and for all n \u2208 N>0 and t \u2208 N\u22650, |Xtn| \u2264 g(t). The following definition of g satisfies these requirements:\ng(t) := { \u03b3tfmax if t < L, 0 otherwise.\nThat is,\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\ng(t) \u2264 {\nfmax 1\u2212\u03b3 if \u03b3 < 1, Lfmax otherwise,\n<\u221e,\nsince we have assumed that \u03b3 can only be 1 in the finite-horizon setting, where L 6= \u221e. Also, |Xtn| = 0 = g(t) by definition if t \u2265 L and if t < L then:\n|Xtn| := \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 n\u2211\ni=1 \u03c1it\u2211n j=1 \u03c1 j t \u03b3tft(H t+1 i )\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u2264\u03b3tfmax n\u2211\ni=1 \u03c1it\u2211n j=1 \u03c1 j t\n=\u03b3tfmax\n=g(t).\nSo, by Property 4, we have (6).\nFinally, we establish an extension of Lemma 12 that will facilitate its use with sequences that are not quite in the form that it is defined for:\nLemma 13. For all t \u2208 N\u22650, let ft : Ht \u2192 R. If Assumption 1 holds, ft = 0 for all t \u2208 N\u2265L, and either: \u2022 Case 1: Assumptions 2 and 3 hold. or\n\u2022 Case 2: Assumption 4 holds and there is a finite fmax such that for all t \u2208 N\u22650 and ht \u2208 Ht, |ft(ht)| < fmax.\nthen\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t n\u2211\ni=1 \u03c1it\u22121\u2211n j=1 \u03c1 j t\u22121 ft(H t i )\na.s.\u2212\u2192 E [ \u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3tft(H t) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223H \u223c \u03c0e ] .\n(10)\nProof. By removing the first term of the sum and shifting the variable that the sum uses by one, we can rewrite the left side of (10) as\n1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\nf0(H 0 i ) +\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t n\u2211\ni=1 \u03c1it\u2211n j=1 \u03c1 j t \u03b3ft+1(H t+1 i ).\nWe have that\n1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\nf0(H 0 i ) a.s.\u2212\u2192 E[f0(H0)], (11)\nby Khintchine\u2019s strong law of large numbers in Case 1, and Kolmogorov\u2019s strong law of large numbers in Case 2 (since f0 is bounded). Also, by Lemma 12 (where the definition of ft+1 in this lemma is used for ft in our application of Lemma 12) we have that\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t n\u2211\ni=1 \u03c1it\u2211n j=1 \u03c1 j t \u03b3ft+1(H t+1 i ) a.s.\u2212\u2192 E [ \u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t+1ft+1(H t+1) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223H \u223c \u03c0e ] .

Doubly Robust Derivation and Proofs", "text": "In this appendix we provide an alternate derivation of the DR estimator using control variates. The idea behind control variates is as follows. Suppose that we would like to estimate \u03b8 := E[X] given a sample of X . The obvious estimator would be \u03b8\u03021 := X . However, if we have a sample of another random variable, Y , with known expected value, E[Y ], then the estimator \u03b8\u03022 := X \u2212 Y + E[Y ] may have\nlower variance. Specifically, while Var(\u03b8\u03021) = Var(X), we have thatVar(\u03b8\u03022) = Var(X)+Var(Y )\u22122Cov(X,Y ). So, \u03b8\u03022 has lower variance than \u03b8\u03021 if 2Cov(X,Y ) > Var(Y ). Often Y is referred to as the control variate. Notice that the optimal control variate is Y := X , since then Var(\u03b8\u03022) = 0. Furthermore, notice that \u03b8\u03022 remains an unbiased estimator of \u03b8 as long as the expected value of Y exists\u2014E[\u03b8\u03022] = E[X \u2212 Y +E[Y ]] = E[X]\u2212E[Y ] +E[Y ] = E[X] = \u03b8. Control variates have been used before in reinforcement learning to reduce the variance of policy gradient estimates (Bhatnagar et al., 2009), where the control variate was referred to as a baseline.\nRecall that we have defined the DR estimator in (2) as\nDR(D) := n\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3twitR Hi t\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 X\n\u2212 n\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t ( witq\u0302 \u03c0e ( SHit , A Hi t ) \u2212 wit\u22121v\u0302\u03c0e ( SHit ))\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 Y\n.\nIn this definition theX term is the per-decision importance sampling (PDIS) estimator, which is known to be an unbiased and strongly consistent estimator of v(\u03c0e) (Precup et al., 2000; Thomas, 2015b). Also, the control variate, Y , is mean zero, i.e., E[Y ] = 0. To see why this control variate is reasonable, notice that all of the terms that are multiplied by \u03b3twit approximately cancel:\nq\u0302\u03c0e ( SHit , A Hi t ) \u2248 RHit + \u03b3v\u0302\u03c0e ( SHit+1 ) .\nSo, Y is a decent approximation of X , and therefore DR(D) will have low variance.\nOur derivation of the control variate used by the DR estimator is based on an alternate view of control variates. If we do not know the expected value of the control variate, Y , but we have another random variable, Z, such that E[Z] = E[Y ], then we can use the unbiased estimator \u03b8\u03023 = X \u2212 Y + Z. The variance of this estimator is given by Var(\u03b8\u03023) = Var(X)+Var(Y \u2212Z)\u22122Cov(X,Y \u2212Z). So, if Y \u2248 X and Z has low variance, then this estimator may have lower variance than \u03b81. Technically, this is an ordinary application of control variates using Y \u2212Z as the mean-zero control variate. We derive DR using this alternate view.\nWe begin with the per-decision importance sampling (PDIS) estimator, which is known to be an unbiased and strongly consistent estimator of v(\u03c0e) (Precup et al., 2000;\nThomas, 2015b). The PDIS estimator is given by:\nPDIS(D) := 1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03c1it\u03b3 tRHit .\nIn order to reduce the variance of this estimator we will subtract a control variate that we expect to be highly correlated with the PDIS estimator, and then add back in the expected value of the control variate:\n1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03c1it\u03b3 tRHit\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 PDIS estimator,X\n\u2212 1 n\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03c1it\u03b3 tr\u0302\u03c0e(SHit , A Hi t , 0)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 control variate, Y\n+E\n[ 1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03c1it\u03b3 tr\u0302\u03c0e(SHit , A Hi t , 0)\n]\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 E[control variate]=E[Y ]\n. (13)\nHere we expect the control variate to be similar to the PDIS estimator if the model\u2019s reward predictions are accurate, i.e., if RHit \u2248 r\u0302\u03c0e(SHit , AHit , 0). If it could be used, (13) would be an extremely lowvariance estimator of v(\u03c0e) sinceX \u2212 Y would usually be near-zero and E[Y ] is a constant that is near v(\u03c0e). However, E[control variate] is not known, and so we cannot use (13) directly. Although estimating E[Y ] is nearly as hard as estimating v(\u03c0e), it is marginally easier. It is easier because v(\u03c0e) uses the unknown transition and reward functions of the MDP to produce the distribution of rewards at each time step, while E[Y ] uses the known approximate model\u2019s transition and reward function for the last transition before each reward occurs. We can therefore estimate E[Y ] using an unbiased estimator that typically has lower variance than the control variate. In the alternate view of control variates this new term will be Z:\n1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03c1it\u03b3 tRHit\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 PDIS estimator,X\n\u2212 1 n\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03c1it\u03b3 tr\u0302\u03c0e ( SHit , A Hi t , 0 )\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 control variate, Y\n+ 1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03c1it\u22121\u03b3 tr\u0302\u03c0e ( SHit , 0 )\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 Z\n. (14)\nHere we expect the Z term to have lower variance than the Y term because for each i and t it only depends on actions AHi1 , . . . , A Hi t\u22121 and not A Hi t . This is reflected in its use of \u03c1it\u22121 rather than \u03c1 i t. Before continuing our derivation we\nverify that E[Y ] = E[Z] if Assumption 1 holds:\nE[Z] =E\n[ 1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03c1it\u22121\u03b3 tr\u0302\u03c0e ( SHit , 0\n)]\n(a) =E   1 n n\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03c1it\u22121\u03b3 t \u03c0e ( AHit |SHit )\n\u03c0i ( AHit |SHit\n) r\u0302\u03c0e ( SHit , A Hi t , 0\n)  \n=E\n[ 1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03c1it\u03b3 tr\u0302\u03c0e ( SHit , A Hi t , 0\n)]\n=E[Y ],\nwhere (a) comes from Lemma 6.\nSo far, in (14), we have introduced a control variate into PDIS that we expect might reduce the variance of the estimator a little without introducing bias. However, it will still have high variance because Z is a high-variance estimator ofE[Y ]. To overcome this, we can introduce another control variate into Z to make it a lower-variance estimator of E[Y ]. So, we introduce another control variate:\n1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03c1it\u03b3 tRHit\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 X\n\u2212 1 n\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03c1it\u03b3 tr\u0302\u03c0e ( SHit , A Hi t , 0 )\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 Y\n+ 1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03c1it\u22121\u03b3 tr\u0302\u03c0e ( SHit , 0 )\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 Z\n\u2212 1 n\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03c1it\u22121\u03b3 tr\u0302\u03c0e ( SHit\u22121, A Hi t\u22121, 1 )\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 new control variate,Y \u2032\n+ 1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03c1it\u22122\u03b3 tr\u0302\u03c0e ( SHit\u22121, 1 )\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 Z\u2032\n.\nHere E[Z \u2032] = E[Y \u2032] (although we omit to proof of this claim), Y \u2032 is similar to Z and so it serves as a good control variate therefor, and Z \u2032 will usually have lower variance than Y \u2032 because it uses \u03c1it\u22122 rather than \u03c1 i t\u22121. However, now Z \u2032 is a high-variance estimator ofE[Y \u2032]. We therefore introduce a control variate for Z \u2032, and this process repeats. This process of introducing control variates eventually terminates when the new control variate is not random.

Our derivation makes neither of these assumptions. That is, it allows for infinite or indefinite horizons and for finite horizons where the horizon is not known. If the horizon, L, is finite and known, then one should ensure that the model uses all of the available information, including the known horizon and time step. In the next section we show that if L is finite and known, then our non-recursive definition of the DR estimator is equivalent to the recursive form of (Jiang & Li, 2015)."}, {"heading": "B.1. Equivalence of DR Definitions", "text": "In this section we show that our non-recursive definition of the DR estimator is equivalent to the recursive definition provided by Jiang & Li (2015) when the horizon is finite and known. Theorem 8. (2) is equivalent to the DR estimator presented by Jiang & Li (2015) if the finite horizon, L, of the MDP is known.\nProof. Jiang & Li (2015) define theDR estimator for a single trajectory (i.e., n = 1) as the last element, XL, of a sequence, (Xi)Li=0. This sequence is defined by the following recurrence relation. LetX0 := 0 and for all k \u2208 {1, . . . , L} let\nXk :=v\u0302 \u03c0e (SL\u2212k) + \u03c0e (AL\u2212k|SL\u2212k) \u03c01 (AL\u2212k|SL\u2212k)\n( RL\u2212k + \u03b3Xk\u22121\n\u2212 q\u0302\u03c0e (SL\u2212k, AL\u2212k) ) .\nAs in the definition of DR(D) in (2), Jiang & Li (2015) define the DR estimator for multiple trajectories to be the average of the estimator for each trajectory individually. So, to show that their recursive definition and our definition are equivalent, we need only show that they are equivalent when there is a single trajectory.\nSince hereafter in this proof we deal with only a single trajectory, we drop the superscripts that we use to specify the trajectory, i.e., we write \u03c1t rather than \u03c11t . Also let \u03c0b := \u03c01 denote the single behavior policy. For further brevity, let\n\u03c0eb(t) := \u03c0e (At|St) \u03c0b (At|St) .\nFirst, notice that we can rewrite (2) for the single-trajectory finite-horizon setting as:\nDR(D) =\nL\u22121\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t\u03c1tRt \u2212 L\u22121\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t\u03c1tq\u0302 \u03c0e (St, At)\n+ L\u22121\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t\u03c1t\u22121v\u0302 \u03c0e (St)) , (16)\nsince SL is surely the absorbing state and so Rt, q\u0302\u03c0e (St, At), and v\u0302\u03c0e (St) are all zero for t \u2265 L. To verify that this definition is equivalent to XL, we will define another sequence, (Yi)Li=1, such that Xi = Yi for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , L} and such that YL = DR(D) trivially. Let\nYk :=\n\u2211L\u22121 t=L\u2212k \u03b3 t [ \u03c1t (Rt \u2212 q\u0302\u03c0e (St, At)) + \u03c1t\u22121v\u0302\u03c0e (St) ]\n\u03b3L\u2212k\u03c1L\u2212k\u22121 .\nNotice that YL is identical to (16) since \u03b3L\u2212L\u03c1L\u2212L\u22121 = 1. So, all that remains is to show that Yk = Xk for all k \u2208 {1, . . . , L}. We will show this using a proof by induction. For the base case, k = 1, it is straightforward to verify that X1 = Y1. For the inductive step we assume the inductive hypothesis that Xk\u22121 = Yk\u22121 and show that then Xk = Yk:\nXk :=v\u0302 \u03c0e (SL\u2212k) + \u03c0 e b(L\u2212 k) ( RL\u2212k + \u03b3Xk\u22121\n\u2212 q\u0302\u03c0e (SL\u2212k, AL\u2212k) )\n=v\u0302\u03c0e (SL\u2212k) + \u03c0 e b(L\u2212 k) ( RL\u2212k + \u03b3Yk\u22121\n\u2212 q\u0302\u03c0e (SL\u2212k, AL\u2212k) ) .\nSubstituting in the definition of Yk\u22121 and performing algebraic manipulations we have that:\nXk =v\u0302 \u03c0e (SL\u2212k) + \u03c0 e b(L\u2212 k)RL\u2212k + \u03c0eb(L\u2212 k) \u03b3L\u2212k\u03c1L\u2212k\n\u00d7 L\u22121\u2211 t=L\u2212k+1 \u03b3t [ \u03c1t (Rt \u2212 q\u0302\u03c0e (St, At)) + \u03c1t\u22121v\u0302\u03c0e (St) ]\n\u2212 \u03c0eb(L\u2212 k)q\u0302\u03c0e (SL\u2212k, AL\u2212k) ,\nwhere\u00d7 denotes that a line was split into multiple lines (we do not use cross-products anywhere in this paper).

Extended Empirical Studies (WDR)", "text": "In this section we provide a detailed description of our experiments comparing the WDR estimator to various importance sampling estimators (IS, PDIS, WIS, CWPDIS), as well as DR and AM. We performed experiments using three domains: ModelFail, ModelWin, and a gridworld. We will describe each domain, then describe the experimental setup, and then present empirical results. All three domains have a finite horizon and use \u03b3 = 1.0."}, {"heading": "D.1. The ModelFail Domain", "text": "The ModelFail domain was constructed so that the model would fail to converge to the true MDP. One way that this can happen is if the model uses function approximation, so that it cannot represent the true MDP. Another way that this can happen is if there is some partial observability, which is common in real applications. We therefore construct a domain where the true underlying MDP has three states (plus the terminal absorbing state), but where the agent cannot tell the difference between any of the states.\nThe MDP used by ModelFail is depicted in Figure 3. Although the MDP has three states (denoted by circles) plus the terminal absorbing state (denoted by the double-circle), the agent does not observe which state it is in\u2014it only sees a single state. The agent begins in the left-most state, where it has two actions available. The first action always takes it to the upper state, while the second always takes in to the lower state. In both cases, the agent receives no reward.\nAt time t = 1, the agent is always in the upper or lower state (although it cannot tell the difference between them and the initial state), and it must select between two possible actions. Both actions always have the same effect\u2014the agent transitions to the terminal absorbing state. However, if the agent was in the upper state, R1 = 1, whileR1 = \u22121 if the agent was in the lower state. The horizon is L = 2 since S2 = \u221e s always.\nThe behavior policy selects a1 with probability approximately 0.88 and a2 with probability approximately 0.12 (these probabilities were chosen arbitrarily by using weights of 1 and \u22121 with softmax action selection,\nand were not optimized). The evaluation policy does the opposite\u2014it selects a1 with probability approximately 0.12 and a2 with probability approximately 0.88.\nConsider what happens when we try to model this MDP based on the observations produced by running the behavior policy to produce an infinite number of trajectories (without trying to infer anything about the true underlying structure of the MDP). Recall that we observe only a single state. First consider the transition dynamics: half of the time either action causes a transition back to the single state, while half of the time the agent transitions to the absorbing state. Next consider the rewards: half of the time the agent receives no reward, with probability 0.88/2 it receives a reward of 1, and with probability 0.12/2 it receives a reward of \u22121, and these rewards appear completely uncorrelated with the action that was selected (since non-zero rewards occur at time t = 1 and A1 has no bearing on rewards or state transitions). So, from the model\u2019s point of view, the actions have no impact on state transitions or rewards, and so every policy is equally good and will produce an expected return of 0.38, while in reality an optimal policy will produce an expected return of 0.5 and a pessimal policy will produce an expected return of \u22120.5. We provided the model with the true horizon, L = 2, so that its predictions of Rt are zero for t \u2265 2."}, {"heading": "D.2. The ModelWin Domain", "text": "This domain was constructed so that the approximate model of the MDP would quickly converge to the true MDP, while importance sampling based approaches like DR and WDR would continue to have high variance. Recall from our discussion in Section 6 that DR and WDR will be equal to a simple model-based approach if the approximate MDP is perfect and state transition and rewards are deterministic. To avoid this, the ModelWin domain has stochastic state transitions that cause the (b) term in (3) to not necessarily be zero.\nThe ModelWin MDP is depicted in Figure 4. Unlike the ModelFail domain, the agent observes the true underlying states of the ModelWin MDP, of which there are three, plus a terminal absorbing state (not pictured). The agent always begins in s1, where it must select between two actions. The\nfirst action, a1, causes the agent to transition to s2 with probability 0.4 and s3 with probability 0.6. The second action, a2, does the opposite: the agent transitions to s2 with probability 0.6 and s3 with probability 0.4. If the agent transitions to s2, then it receives a reward of 1, and if it transitions to s3 it receives a reward of \u22121. In states s2 and s3, the agent has two possible actions, but both always produce a reward of zero and a deterministic transition back to s1. The horizon is set to L = 20, so, S20 = \u221e s always.12\nTo see why DR and WDR struggle on this domain, consider what happens if the approximate model is perfect and the agent takes action a1 in state s1. In our discussion of (3) we concluded that DR and WDR will perform well if R1 = q\n\u03c0e(s1, a1) \u2212 \u03b3v\u0302\u03c0e(S\u2032), where S\u2032 is the state that the agent transitions to after taking action a1 in state s1, which is a random variable. Consider the two values that the right side can take, depending on whether S\u2032 = s2 or S\u2032 = s3. It can be either q\u0302\u03c0e(s1, a1) \u2212 \u03b3v\u0302\u03c0e(s2) or q\u0302\u03c0e(s1, a1) \u2212 \u03b3v\u0302\u03c0e(s3). Since v\u0302\u03c0e(s2) = v\u0302\u03c0e(s3), these two statements are equal\u2014the prediction of R1 will be the same regardless of whether the agent transitions to s2 or s3, and so its prediction must sometimes be wrong (since the rewards differ depending on whether the agent transitions to s2 or s3). So, term (b) in (3) will not be zero\u2014the control variate used by DR and WDR does not perfectly cancel with the PDIS (or CWPDIS) term. If wit is large, then this will produce high variance. In order to make wit large, we need only make the horizon long and the behavior and evaluation policies dissimilar.\nThe behavior and evaluation policies both select actions uniformly randomly in states s2 and s3. However, in s1 the behavior policy takes action a1 with probability approximately 0.73 and action a2 with probability approximately 0.27, while the evaluation policy does the opposite\u2014it takes action a1 with probability approximately 0.27 and action a2 with probability approximately 0.73 (these probabilities come from using softmax action selection with weights of 1 and 0).\n12Technically, implementing the horizon of L = 20 requires the states to be augmented to include the current time step so that state transitions are Markovian. The approximate model is provided with the time step and the horizon.\nAs in the ModelFail domain, for the ModelWin domain we provided the approximate model with the true horizon of the MDP, L = 20, so that its predictions of Rt were zero for t \u2265 20."}, {"heading": "D.3. The Gridworld Domain", "text": "The third domain that we used was the gridworld domain developed by Thomas (2015b, Section 2.5) for evaluating OPE algorithms. It is a 4 \u00d7 4 gridworld with four actions, L = 100, and deterministic transition and reward functions. This domain was developed specifically for evaluating different OPE methods. Thomas (2015b) proposed five policies, \u03c01, . . . , \u03c05, that can serve as the behavior and evaluation policies.\nAlthough this setup was developed for evaluating OPE methods, it was not developed with DR and WDR in mind (since they were introduced later). Specifically, its use of deterministic state-transition and reward functions means that when the model is accurate, AM, DR, and WDR will all perform similarly (due the the (b) term in (3) being nearzero).\nWe therefore performed experiments with two variants of this gridworld. In the first variant the approximate model was provided with the horizon, L = 100. However, in the second variant we introduced some partial observability by providing the model with the incorrect horizon: L = 101. This has a significant impact for value predictions close to the end of a trajectory because the model incorrectly predicts when the rewards will necessarily be zero. We write Gridworld-TH and Gridworld-FH to denote the gridworld where the agent is provided with the true horizon and false horizon, respectively."}, {"heading": "D.4. Experimental Setup", "text": "For each domain we generated n trajectories (for various n) and computed the sample mean squared error between the predictions of the various OPE methods and the true performance of the evaluation policy (estimated using a large number of on-policy Monte-Carlo rollouts). For each value of n and each OPE algorithm, we performed this experiment 128 times and report the average sample mean squared error over these 128 trials. All plots include standard error bars and use logarithmic scales for both the horizontal and vertical axes.\nPerhaps surprisingly, it is not obvious how to fairly compare the different OPE algorithms. Clearly IS, PDIS, WIS, and CWPDIS should use all of the trajectories in D, since they do not require an approximate model. Similarly, AM should use all of the data to construct an approximate model. However, how should the available data be split for DR, WDR, and the MAGIC estimators? We believe that\nthere are at least three reasonable answers:\n1. DR, WDR, and MAGIC should be provided with additional trajectories not available to IS, PDIS, WIS, and CWPDIS, and these trajectories should be used to construct an approximate model. This setup would emulate the setting where prior domain knowledge (not necessarily trajectories) can be used to construct an approximate model, which IS, PDIS, WIS, and CWPDIS ignore. 2. DR, WDR, and MAGIC should use all of the available data, D, to construct an approximate model. They should then reuse this same data to compute their estimates. This approach is reasonable, but the reuse of data invalidates our theoretical guarantees. Still, empirically we find that this approach causes DR, WDR, and MAGIC to perform at their best. 3. DR, WDR, and MAGIC should partition D into two sets. The first set should be used to construct the approximate model, and the second set should be used to compute the DR, WDR, and MAGIC estimates using the approximate model.\nSince there is not necessarily a \u201ccorrect\u201d answer to which way of performing experiments is best, we show our results using both the second and third approach. For each domain, the \u201cfull-data\u201d variant uses the second approach while the \u201chalf-data\u201d variant uses the third approach, whereD is partitioned into two sets of equal size.\nSince all of the domains that we use have finite state and action sets, we use a simple maximum-likelihood approximate model. That is, we predict that the probability of transitioning from s to s\u2032 given action a is the number of times this transition was observed divided by the number of times action a was taken in state s. If D contains no examples of action a being taken in state s, then we assume that taking action a in state s always causes a transition to the terminal absorbing state.\nIn this appendix, we present empirical results from four previous importance sampling methods, definitions of which can be found in the work of Thomas (2015b, Chapter 3): importance sampling (IS), per-decision importance sampling (PDIS), weighted importance sampling (WIS), and consistent weighted per-decision importance sampling (CWPDIS). We also show results for the guided importance sampling methods DR and WDR and the purely modelbased method, AM.

ModelFail Results", "text": "Figure 1b in Section 6 depicts the result on the ModelFail domain in the full-data setting. We reproduce this plot in Figure 6. Here the weighted importance sampling methods, WIS and CWPDIS, are obscured by the curve for WDR, while the unweighted importance sampling methods, IS and PDIS, are obscured by the curve for DR. Notice that WDR outperforms AM by orders of magnitude and DR by approximately an order of magnitude. Also notice that even though the approximate model is not accurate, which means that the control variates used by DR and WDR may be poor, the DR andWDR estimators do not perform worse than PDIS and CWPDIS, respectively.\nIn Figure 7 we reproduce this experiment in the half-data setting. Since AM does not use any data for importance sampling, in both settings (half-data and full-data) it is identical. Similarly, IS, PDIS, WIS, and CWPDIS do not use an approximate model, so they always use all of the data and are therefore also identical in both settings. However, DR and WDR are not the same\u2014they use half of the data to construct the approximate model and the other half to compute their estimates. This means that, for DR and WDR, the approximate model tends to be worse, and the importance sampling estimate also tends to be worse. As a result, the DR and WDR curves are shifted up slightly. Still, the same general trends are evident\u2014WDR outperforms AM by orders and DR by an order."}, {"heading": "D.6.

As with the ModelWin setup, this only hurts DR and WDR. When there are few trajectories, it appears to impact DR more than WDR, although this may be due to noise (notice the large standard error bars on the DR curve when n is small."}, {"heading": "D.7. Gridworld Results", "text": "Figure 1a in Section 6 depicts the results of using the fourth gridworld policy, \u03c04, as the behavior policy and the fifth, \u03c05, as the evaluation policy for the Gridworld-FH domain in the full-data setting.

As before there is little change, except that the DR and WDR curves shift up. WDR remains the bestperforming estimator, by approximately an order of magnitude.\nNext we reproduced Figures 10 and 11 for Gridworld-TH as opposed to Gridworld-FH. The results are in Figures 12 and 13 respectively. Notice that, when given the true horizon, AM excels. In the full-data setting DR and WDR both lie directly on top of the curve for AM. This makes sense because the transition function and reward function are deterministic, and so, given the way that we constructed our approximate model, both methods degenerate to exactly AM. In the half-data setting DR and WDR lag slightly behind the curve for AM since they can only use half as much data.\nNext we reproduced these four figures using the first gridworld policy, \u03c01, as the behavior policy and the second, \u03c02, as the evaluation policy. Whereas \u03c04 and \u03c05 are nearly deterministic and produce long trajectories, \u03c01 and \u03c02 are far from deterministic and tend to produce shorter trajectories. Notably, the behavior policy, \u03c01, selects actions uniformly randomly, and so this presents a very different setting for OPE. The results are provided in Figures 14\u201317. In this example, DR and WDR perform similarly\u2014significantly better than the importance sampling algorithms IS, PDIS, WIS, and CWPDIS, and marginally better than AM given enough data. Also, when the true horizon is provided to the model, DR and WDR again degenerate to AM."}, {"heading": "D.8. Summary", "text": "The key takeaways from these experiments are that WDR tends to outperform the other importance sampling estimators, IS, PDIS, WIS, and CWPDIS, as well as the guided importance sampling method, DR. None of these methods achieved mean squared errors within an order of magnitude of WDR\u2019s across all of our experiments. This shows the power of WDR as a guided importance sampling method.\nHowever, WDR did not always win\u2014in the ModelFail setting, AM outperformed WDR by an order of magnitude. Similar results have been observed by others. For example, in the experiments of Jiang & Li (2015), AM tended to outperform DR (although they did not compare to WDR, since it had not yet been introduced). This motivated our introduction of the BIM estimator as a way to blend together WDR and AM.\nNotice that, if the transition function and reward function are deterministic and there is no partial observability (as in the gridworld experiments using the true horizon), then, given the way that we constructed our approximate model, DR andWDR degenerate to AM. This degeneration (which\nis not bad, but suggests that importance sampling methods are not necessary) would also not occur if the approximate model used function approximation.\nLastly, notice that DR and WDR performed better in the full-data setting than in the half-data setting. This suggests that, in practice, one should use all of the available data both to produce an approximate model and to compute the DR and WDR estimates. Even though this violates the assumptions used by our theoretical guarantees, this does not mean, for example, that MAGIC will not still be a strongly consistent estimator for the application at hand."}, {"heading": "E. Consistency of BIM", "text": "In this appendix we prove Theorem 3, which states that if Assumption 4 holds, there exists at least one j \u2208 J such that g(j)(D) is a strongly consistent estimator of v(\u03c0e), and b\u0302n \u2212 bn a.s.\u2212\u2192 0, and \u2126\u0302n \u2212 \u2126n a.s.\u2212\u2192 0, then BIM(D, \u2126\u0302n, b\u0302n)\na.s.\u2212\u2192 v(\u03c0e). We begin by showing that BIM converges almost surely to v(\u03c0e) if it were to use the true \u2126n and bn, rather than estimates thereof. Let j\u22c6 \u2208 J be an index such that g(j \u22c6)(D) a.s.\u2212\u2192 v(\u03c0e), which exists by assumption. Let y \u2208 \u2206|J | be the weight vector that places a weight of one on g(j\n\u22c6)(D) and a weight of zero on the other returns, such that y\u22bagJ (D) = g(j \u22c6)(D) a.s.\u2212\u2192 v(\u03c0e).

Since (x\u22c6)\u22bagJ (D) = BIM(D,\u2126n,bn) this can be rewritten as\nlim n\u2192\u221e MSE(BIM(D,\u2126n,bn), v(\u03c0e)) = 0.\nBy Lemma 3 we have that this implies that BIM(D,\u2126nbn)\na.s.\u2212\u2192 v(\u03c0e).

Derivation of g(j)(D) using WDR In this appendix we derive a reasonable definition for g(j)(D), the off-policy j-step return, when using WDR for the importance sampling estimator. We assume that the reader is familiar with our use of control variates in Appendix B. First, consider what control variate should be added to the j-step PDIS or CWPDIS estimator:\nn\u2211\ni=1\nj\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3twitR Hi t ,\nwhere the definition of wit determines whether this is PDIS or CWPDIS. Reproducing our arguments from Appendix B, we find that a reasonable definition for IS(j)(D) is similar to (15), but with the time index, t, summing only to t = j and using wit terms rather than \u03c1 i t terms for generality:\nIS(j)(D) := n\u2211\ni=1\nj\u2211\nt=0\nwit\u03b3 tRHit\n\u2212 n\u2211\ni=1\nj\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t t\u2211\n\u03c4=0\nwi\u03c4 r\u0302 \u03c0e ( SHi\u03c4 , A Hi \u03c4 , t\u2212 \u03c4 )\n+\nn\u2211\ni=1\nj\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b3t t\u2211\n\u03c4=0\nwi\u03c4\u22121r\u0302 \u03c0e ( SHi\u03c4 , t\u2212 \u03c4 ) .\nNotice that this definition is not equivalent to what one would get if (2) were modified only so that the sum goes from time t = 0 to t = j, since that definition would include reward predictions beyond Rj in v\u0302 and q\u0302 terms. Instead, this definition is equivalent to the definition of (2) if it were applied to a modified MDP where every episode terminates after Rj is produced.\nNext, consider the definition of AM(j)(D). We might use importance sampling to correct for the distribution of Sj , and the model to predict the remaining rewards:13\nAM(j)(D) =\u03b3j n\u2211\ni=1\nwij\u22121v\u0302 \u03c0e(SHij )\n=\u03b3j n\u2211\ni=1\nwij\u22121\n\u221e\u2211\n\u03c4=0\n\u03b3\u03c4 r\u0302\u03c0e(SHij , \u03c4).\n13This is just one possible definition of AM(j). We also experimented with a definition that is purely model based: AM(j)(D) := \u2211 s\u2208S d\u03020(s) \u2211\u221e t=j \u03b3\ntr\u0302\u03c0e(s, t). Since this definition does not include any importance weights, it does not require an additional control variate.

We use \u03ba to denote the number of times the bootstrap algorithm should resample the trajectories. In our experiments we used \u03ba = 200. In general, it should be made as large as possible given any runtime constraints.

However, as the trajectory progresses the robot may be able to better localize itself, removing or diminishing the uncertainty.\nWe emulate this setting by concatenating the ModelFail and ModelWin domains. That is, the agent begins in the ModelFail domain. Whenever it would transition to the absorbing state, it instead transitions to the initial state of the ModelWin domain."}, {"heading": "I.2. Experimental Setup", "text": "We performed these experiments in the same way as those in Appendix D, except that we compared different estimators. Specifically, we introduce curves for the MAGIC estimator, but remove the curves for the poorly-performing importance sampling estimators, IS, PDIS, WIS, and CWPDIS. So, the plots contain curves for DR, WDR, AM, and MAGIC. The legend used by all of the plots in this appendix is provided in Figure 18.\nDR AM WDR MAGIC MAGIC-B\nFigure 18: The legend used by all plots in Appendix I.\nAlso, for the hybrid domain we included a curve for binary MAGIC (MAGIC-B), which uses J = {\u22121,\u221e}. Whereas MAGIC blends between AM and WDR using off-policy jstep returns of various lengths, binary MAGIC only places weights on AM and WDR. Our comparison to MAGICB shows the importance of including the off-policy j-step returns rather than merely trying to switch between, or directly weight, AM and WDR.\nLastly, since all of the domains have finite horizons, we used J = {\u22121, . . . , L} for MAGIC. This means that it uses all of the possible off-policy j-step returns."}, {"heading": "I.3. ModelFail Results", "text": "Figure 2b in Section 9 depicts the results for the ModelFail domain in the full-data setting. We reproduce this plot in Figure 19. In Figure 20 we show the results for ModelFail in the half-data setting. There is little difference between the plots\u2014in both cases MAGIC properly tracks WDR, so that both WDR and MAGIC outperform AM an DR by at least an order of magnitude for most n."}, {"heading": "I.4. ModelWin Results", "text": "Figure 2c in Section 9 depicts the results for the ModelWin domain in the full-data setting. We reproduce this plot in Figure 21. In Figure 22 we show the results for ModelFail in the half-data setting. In both cases MAGIC tracks AM, although it drifts away a little as n increases. This suggests that there may be room for improvement in our estimates of \u2126n and bn. However, also notice that due to the logarithmic scale, the difference between MAGIC and AM is small in comparison to the distance between MAGIC and DR."}, {"heading": "I.5. Gridworld Results", "text": "Figures 23 through 30 depict the results for the GridworldFH and Gridworld-TH domains in both the full and halfdata settings. The same general trends are visible. First, WDR tends to outperform DR, sometimes by an order of magnitude. Also, MAGIC tends to track WDR, since in these experiments it is usually the best-performing algorithm. Lastly, for the Gridworld-TH, full-data setting, DR, WDR, and MAGIC all degenerate to AM, while in the Gridworld-TH, half-data setting they degenerate to approximately AM using half as much data."}, {"heading": "I.6. Hybrid Results", "text": "Last, but not least, Figures 31 and 32 show the results on the Hybrid domain in the full-data and half-data settings, respectively.

Summary", "text": "Overall, MAGIC acts as desired\u2014it tracks WDR or AM, whichever is better for the application at hand. However, notice that it does not do this perfectly, particularly when there is little data available. This is likely because when there is little data it is difficult to estimate \u2126n, and the confidence interval used when estimating bn will be loose. In some cases, even when there is a large amount of data, MAGIC struggles to properly track AM. However, this tends to be when both methods perform well, and may be\n0.0001\n0.001\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n2 20 200 2,000\nM e\na n\nS q\nu a\nre d\nE rr\no r\nNumber of Episodes, n\nFigure 29: Gridworld-TH, full-data. p1p2\n0.0001\n0.001\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n2 20 200 2,000\nM e\na n\nS q\nu a\nre d\nE rr\no r\nNumber of Episodes, n\nFigure 30: Gridworld-TH, half-data. p1p2\ndue to an increased difficulty of determining which method to favor when they both are improving rapidly with n.\nWe also showed in Figures 31 and 32 an example where MAGIC outperformed MAGIC-B by an order of magnitude, and all previous methods (including DR) by 2\u20133 orders of magnitude. This exemplifies 1) the importance of blending between importance sampling methods and purely model-based estimators using off-policy j-step returns, as opposed to selecting between or directly weighting WDR and AM and 2) the power of MAGIC relative to existing estimators."}, {"heading": "J. Future Work", "text": "Several avenues of future work remain. Good performance of MAGIC is contingent on our ability to efficiently estimate \u2126n and bn, and so improved estimators for these terms could yield even better performance. For instance, if the sample mean importance weight is near zero, then the importance sampling estimators have high variance that is not captured by the sample covariance matrix that we use.\nAnother possible avenue of future work would be to consider how MAGIC could be applied when our fundamental assumptions are violated. For example, what should be done if the transition and reward functions of the MDP are nonstationary? Can our estimators be extended to the average reward setting? What should be done if the behavior policies are not known exactly? If the approximate model is not provided initially, but constructed from the same data that is used to produce the DR,WDR, orMAGIC estimates, will DR, WDR, and MAGIC remain strongly consistent estimators? If there are multiple approximate models available, is there a way to detect which one will work best with DR, WDR, and MAGIC?"}], "references": [{"title": "The elements of integration and Lebesgue measure", "author": ["Bartle", "Robert G"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Bartle and G.,? \\Q2014\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bartle and G.", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Linear least-squares algorithms for temporal difference learning", "author": ["S.J.
