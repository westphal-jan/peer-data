In a traditional face-to-face conversation, paralanguage, or the ancillary meaning- and emotion-laden aspects of speech that are not actual verbal prose, gives contextual information that allows interactors to more appropriately understand the message being conveyed. In this paper, we conceptualize textual paralanguage (TPL), which we define as written manifestations of nonverbal audible, tactile, and visual elements that supplement or replace written language and that can be expressed through words, symbols, images, punctuation, demarcations, or any combination of these elements. We develop a typology of textual paralanguage using data from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. We present a conceptual framework of antecedents and consequences of brands\u2019 use of textual paralanguage. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.\nA customer of Whole Foods tweets that he received a bad cupcake from the grocer, to\nwhich Whole Foods replies, \u201cA bad cupcake?!!?! Oh No!!! I\u2019m so sorry. *sigh* Thank you for letting us know\u201d (Whole Foods Market, 2013). How does communication on social media affect brand perceptions? Marketers are communicating with customers using a \u201cshorthand, digital language\u201d (Smith, 2015), yet the nature of these communications is under-investigated.\nIn marketing, research on linguistics has focused primarily on the effects of word choice,\nsuch as the effect of explanatory words on consumption experiences (Moore, 2012), refusal words on choice (Patrick & Hagtvedt, 2012), and vowel sounds in brand names on brand preferences (Lowrey & Shrum, 2007). We also see evidence that imperative messages (e.g., \u201cBuy Now!\u201d) are more effective in uncommitted consumer-brand relationships (Moore, ZemackRugar, & Fitzsimons, working paper), and assertive statements are more effective at garnering consumer compliance for hedonic products (Kronrod, Grinstein, & Wathieu, 2012). In contrast, our work focuses not on the words said, but on the way nonverbal information is conveyed in writing.\nAs computer-mediated communication (CMC) has become more prevalent, people have\nevolved new ways of communicating. Electronic messages are often imbued with nonverbal cues that signal individual characteristics, attitudes, and emotions. Indeed, various researchers recognize that people adapt to the limitations of CMC by creating surrogates for missing social cues (Byron & Baldridge, 2007; Ganster, Eimler, & Kr\u00e4mer, 2012; Walther, 1996). The primary goal of this paper is to provide a framework for the surrogates that people are using in digital communications.\nWe define textual paralanguage (TPL) as written manifestations of nonverbal audible,\ntactile, and visual elements that supplement or replace written language and that can be\n2\nexpressed through words, symbols, images, punctuation, demarcations, or any combination of these elements. Expression of nonverbals in text typically differs from the verbal message in several ways: (1) the words are delineated by special characters (e.g., \u201c*\u201d) or styles (e.g., CAPS), (2) the words are not standard English but still possess meaning, (3) the words do not flow grammatically with the sentence, and/or (4) the nonverbals occur in the form of a visual image (e.g., emoji). The Whole Foods\u2019 tweet, for example, contains four instances of TPL: \u201c?!!?!\u201d, \u201cOh\u201d, \u201c!!!\u201d, and \u201c*sigh*\u201d.\nIn this paper, we take both an inductive and a deductive approach to the\nconceptualization of TPL, first exploring how linguistic theory informs the study of TPL, then analyzing how companies are using TPL in their online interactions. We theorize five types of TPL and conclude with a discussion of theoretical and managerial implications as well as avenues for future research.\nIn-Person Nonverbal Communication and Behavior\nNonverbal communication refers to communication effected by means other than words\n(Knapp, Hall, & Horgan, 2013). It is readily observed in all in-person interactions, yet the notion of what constitutes nonverbal communication online is not as clear. To understand the nature of nonverbals in text, we first explore nonverbals in face-to-face interactions."}, {"heading": "Auditory Nonverbal Communication", "text": "One of the earliest theorists to study nonverbal communication was Trager (1958, 1960),\nwho noted the depth and importance of information communicated by aspects of speech such as pitch, rhythm, and tempo. Trager (1958) described paralanguage in terms of vocal qualities and vocalizations that qualify literal words. These vocal properties have been termed \u201cimplicit\u201d\n3\naspects of speech (Mehrabian, 1970) since human speech is naturally imbued with vocal sounds. Communicating aspects of speech aside from literal words has been common among playwrights for centuries. In cinema and theater, paralinguistic elements are inserted into scripts to give stage directions, relay emotions, and facilitate interaction, guiding theatrical performance across languages, cultures, and time (Poyatos, 2008)."}, {"heading": "Visual Nonverbal Communication", "text": "Just as auditory aspects of speech are inherent in face-to-face communication, so too are\nvisual elements of communication. Birdwhistell (1970) investigated kinesics, the conscious or unconscious bodily movements that possess communicative value, including human gestures and body language. An important bodily communicator is the human face; some scholars claim that it is the primary source of communicative information next to human speech (Knapp et al., 2013). Subtle changes in facial muscle movements can communicate emotional states and provide nonverbal feedback (Ekman et al., 1987). It is thus not surprising that visual textual paralinguistic elements exist in the form of facial emojis.\nNonverbal visual elements are not exclusively related to bodily movements. Visual\npresentational style conveys information in face-to-face communication through adornments, clothing, style, tattoos, and cosmetics (Barnard, 2001). Often referred to as artifacts, these stylistic choices possess nonverbal signaling power that can communicate personality characteristics (Back, Schmulke, & Egloff, 2010) and are often the basis for initial judgments and impressions."}, {"heading": "Haptic Nonverbal Communication", "text": "Touch is the most basic form of communication; indeed, at birth the sense of touch is the\n4\nmost developed of our senses (Hall, 1966; Knapp et al., 2013). Young children use touch to explore their environment, and later in life touch becomes an effective method for communicating with others. We know that individuals have differing preferences for touch in interactions with others, with some people seeking out touch when others avoid it (Webb & Peck, 2015). The meaning of touch in interaction is highly dependent on environmental, personal, and contextual factors. Recent research shows that the degree of relationship closeness influences the types of touch that are deemed appropriate (Suvilehto, Glerean, Dunbar, Hari, & Nummenmaa, 2015).\nNonverbal Communication Online and Textual Paralanguage Conceptualization\nGiven the importance of nonverbal communication in face-to-face interactions, it is\nreasonable to assume that nonverbals play an important role in textual communication as well. Various researchers have noted the presence of paralinguistic elements in text-based messages (e.g., Lea & Spears, 1992; Poyatos, 2008). Lea and Spears (1992) suggest that paralinguistic marks, which they define as ellipses, inverted commas, quotation marks, and exclamation marks, affect perceptions of anonymous communicators online. Although symbols and punctuation possess communicative value, a broader conceptualization of textual paralanguage is needed. To this end, we propose a typology for categorizing and differentiating the various paralinguistic elements that occur in text. It is our hope that this typology will facilitate future research on TPL, its antecedents, and its consequences.\nCombining theoretical perspectives on verbal and nonverbal communication, we assert\nthat in-person paralanguage and text-based paralanguage vary in three consequential ways. First, face-to-face paralanguage is typically superimposed on the message, whereas TPL is often\n5\ndecomposed. That is, in face-to-face communication, the verbal and nonverbal elements are combined; vocal aspects of speech are inherent in the production of speech, and gestures occur concurrently with the message (Key, 1975). In text-based communication, however, it is possible for the paralinguistic element (e.g., *wink*) to occur before or after the verbal component of the message.\nSecond, paralanguage in face-to-face communication is more likely to be processed\nnonconsciously; that is, in-person gestures and nonverbals are encoded and decoded with varying degrees of awareness and control (Knapp et al., 2013). In text, however, encoding and decoding of paralanguage is more likely to be a conscious process. Whereas in-person nonverbals may be incidental or automatically enacted (e.g., smiling while talking), nonverbals in text tend to be more deliberate and intentional (e.g., inserting a smiley face).\nThird, when communicating in-person, paralanguage may be seen, heard, or felt, but in\ntext it is visual, since it is through the eyes that the message and accompanying paralanguage are received. Although audible and haptic cues are referenced in text, no auditory or haptic stimuli are experienced. That said, TPL may evoke imagery of represented gestures, sounds, or facial expressions, which can make the message more concrete and realistic (Borst & Kosslyn, 2010).\nOur typology of TPL (figure 1) is based on the senses predominantly used in human\ninteraction: sound, touch, and visuals, rather than taste and smell, which are more relevant for personal experience. From the literature, we identified auditory, tactile, and visual properties of communication that are likely to occur in text. Consistent with previous research on paralanguage, we distinguish between voice qualities, vocalizations, and kinesics (Key, 1975). We further add a category of \u201cartifacts\u201d to accommodate visuals in text that may not correspond directly to in-person communication. We elaborate on each of these in the following paragraphs.\n6\nVoice Qualities. Voice qualities are characteristics of the sound of the words being\ncommunicated that have to do with how the word(s) should be spoken. This type of paralanguage represents auditory properties and incorporates aspects such as emphasis, pitch, and rhythm. Voice qualities are often communicated through capitalization, underlining, punctuation, and special characters (e.g., an asterisk). An example of a message that conveys voice qualities, and more specifically rhythm, is \u201cBest. Sale. Ever.\u201d The rhythm of the message is indicated by the periods after each word. Thus, the TPL imbues the message with additional significance, and \u201cBest. Sale. Ever.\u201d conveys more information than \u201cBest sale ever.\u201d There are also non-standard spellings of words that are intentionally written to convey sound qualities. As Carey (1980, p. 67) notes, \u201c[mis]spelling may serve to mark a regional accent or an idiosyncratic manner of speech.\u201d For example, \u201cvell vell\u201d suggests a different intonation than \u201cwell well\u201d.\nVocalizations. Vocalizations are utterances, fillers, terms, or sounds that can be spoken\nor produced by the body and that result in an audible noise that is recognizable. Vocalizations are not necessarily English words, but they do convey meaning. Examples include utterances such as \u201cumm\u201d or \u201cuhhh,\u201d which, depending on the context of the message, may convey hesitancy, nervousness, or indecision. Physiologic or bodily sounds, such as burping or sneezing, are also included in this type of paralanguage. While some vocalizations are clearly not \u201cEnglish words,\u201d there are vocal sounds that have been granted \u201cword\u201d status by dictionaries. For example, \u201cuh\u201d and \u201cuh-huh\u201d are considered words by Merriam-Webster. Conversely, \u201czzz\u201d is not recognized by Merriam-Webster or the Oxford English Dictionary (OED, 2015), although it is found in almost every online dictionary (e.g., Dictionary.com, 2015).\nTactile Kinesics. Tactile kinesics is the conveyance of nonverbal communication related\nto physical, haptic interaction with another individual. Tactile kinesic TPL includes interactional\n7\nelements between two communicating parties through the use of interpersonal touch. For example, \u201c*high five*\u201d is a tactile kinesic because it is suggestive of physical contact between the sender and the recipient.\nVisual Kinesics. Visual kinesics is the conveyance of nonverbal communication related\nto representation or movement of any part of the body or the body as a whole. Visual kinesics in TPL includes emoticons and emojis that signify bodily movements. Although various researchers have investigated the use of emoticons in online communications (e.g., Kim & Gupta, 2012, Walther & D\u2019Addario, 2001), within our conceptualization emoticons are simply one example of visual kinesic paralanguage. For example, \u201c*eyeroll*\u201d indicates a bodily movement and thus is an example of visual kinesic TPL.\nArtifacts. Artifacts are the presentational style of the text-based message. In text,\nartifacts pertain to how the message appears: typeface, stylistic spacing, color, formatting, and layout. Investigating written communication in print advertising, Childers and Jass (2002) demonstrate that typeface semantic cues affect brand perceptions. Also included in this category are non-kinesic and non-tactile emojis and stickers, such as the emoji for a car. Images and icons often supplement or replace words in online communications.\n[INSERT FIGURE 1]\nExploratory Study: Brands\u2019 Use of Textual Paralanguage\nHeretofore we have employed an inductive approach to understanding the TPL\nphenomenon. In this study we approach TPL deductively; that is, we examine evidentiary data to\n8\nsee how TPL is being used in actual online communications. We examine brand posts on various social media platforms to substantiate our framework."}, {"heading": "Sample", "text": "To adequately capture the TPL phenomenon, we selected large national brands that have\na diverse social media presence. It is common for brand communications to originate from both a corporate account (e.g., @Geico) and a spokescharacter account (e.g., @TheGEICOGecko) (Cohen, 2014). For each brand and spokescharacter, the most recent posts from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram were collected. These text-based messages were then imported into TAMS Analyzer, an open source tool for coding text, and three individuals manually coded the tweets for TPL. (For additional methodological information and analyses, see the Methodological Details Appendix.)"}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "In our sample, 20.6% of brand tweets, 19.1% of Facebook posts, and 31.3% of Instagram\nposts contained TPL. Across the three platforms, there is evidence that all five types of TPL are utilized by brands, with voice qualities appearing most frequently and tactile kinesics least frequently (tables 1, 2, 3 and 4).\nUses of TPL emerged from the data that were not initially theorized from our review of\nthe literature. One example is the spelling out of words. In a Facebook post, Chester the Cheetah (2014) wrote, \u201cHow do you spell Flamin\u2019 Hot CHEETOS Burrito? M-I-N-E\u201d. The use of the dashes to separate the letters in \u201cmine\u201d indicates that each letter is to be vocalized, thus representing a new instance of voice quality.\n9\n[INSERT TABLES 1, 2, 3, 4]\nAntecedents of Textual Paralanguage Use\nWe now touch on brand, platform, and target audience factors that motivate the use of\nTPL (figure 2). In online communications, brands try to foster a strong \u201csocial presence\u201d and the perception of being \u201creal\u201d (Sung & Mayer, 2012; Tu, 2002). Successful interaction with customers online has been attributed to whether or not an organization can demonstrate a \u201cconversational human voice\u201d (Kelleher, 2009). Many individuals within an organization contribute to the voice of the organization, and the degree to which interactions are interactive, candid, and \u201chuman\u201d can have a lasting impact on relational outcomes, especially when encountering negative electronic word of mouth (Van Noort & Willemsen, 2012). Since nonverbal cues are lacking in electronic communication (Walther, 1993), online communicators use TPL to convey meaning and emotion.\nCertain product categories, such as orange juice, possess inherent personality differences\n(e.g., warmth) compared to other product categories, like pain relievers (Bennett & Hill, 2012). TPL may be beneficial for brands that are motivated to create a young, relatable, or warm image. Brands may also choose to use TPL differentially across their communication portfolios. Consumer brands, like people, are imbued with personality traits (Aaker, 1997; Fournier, 1998), often through techniques such as anthropomorphism (Aggarwal & McGill, 2012) and the use of a brand mascot (Brown, 2010), and these characters may be more likely to use TPL. Additionally, the type of TPL employed may depend on the personality of the communicator. Barbe and Milone (1980) identify visual, auditory, and kinesthetic cognitive learning styles. A visual individual may use more artifacts, a kinesthetic communicator may prefer tactile kinesics,\n10\nand an auditory-oriented individual may favor vocalizations.\nBesides brand considerations, platform-specific norms of communication may guide the\nuse of TPL. For example, the character limit on Twitter encourages posters to find unique ways of constructing messages to save space (e.g., J). In addition, platforms are characterized by differences in synchronicity (Porter, 2004). In synchronous communication, conversations take place in real time through written language (Hoffman & Novak, 1996), as in online chats with customer service representatives. In asynchronous communication, posting, viewing, and responding takes place at intervals of time. Since synchronous communication requires immediate responses, message length is necessarily limited, and it is possible that synchronous interactions will contain more TPL.\nCommunications also vary based on the target or the intended recipient of a message. For\nexample, a younger target may respond more positively to the informal nature of TPL. When a brand is communicating directly with one customer, the personality of the recipient is likely to influence whether TPL is used and how it is interpreted. If a brand is interacting with an expressive and emotional consumer, more consideration may be given to the use of TPL.\nConsequences of Textual Paralanguage Use\nTPL has potential downstream consequences for brands (figure 2). For example, TPL is\nlikely to impact perceptions of a brand\u2019s personality (Aaker, 1997). Warmth and competence are two characteristics that brands may cultivate, since these translate into increased consumer engagement, connection, and loyalty (Aaker, Garbinsky, & Vohs, 2012). Emoticons, for example, are used more in communications with friends than strangers (Derks, Bos, & Von Grumbkow, 2008) and may foster feelings of warmth and personableness. Emoticons have also\n11\nbeen viewed as casual and unprofessional (Jett, 2005), though, and the level of informality associated with TPL could potentially hurt perceptions of firm competence.\nAside from perceptions of a brand\u2019s personality, TPL has the potential to influence the\nbrand-consumer relationship. Tactile kinesics, for example, may be used to convey relationship closeness. Many of the textual paralinguistic elements that fall into this category are of a personal nature (e.g., \u201c*hug*\u201d), which foster a sense of closeness.\nOn the consumer end, TPL may affect message interpretation. Derks et al. (2008) show\nthat emoticons strengthen the intensity of a message. They find that emoticons often serve the same functions as nonverbal behavior and aid in message comprehension. Brand and consumer effects of TPL remain unstudied empirically, and in the next section we consider avenues for future research.\n[INSERT FIGURE 2]\nGeneral Discussion and Future Research\nIn 2015 the Oxford Dictionaries chose, for the first time ever, an emoji as the word of the\nyear (Dictionaries, 2015). Textual paralanguage has become germane to consumer and marketing communications, and it carries the potential to shape how messages are understood. This work suggests that there exists much complexity in the way in which textual messages are used and interpreted. By developing a typology of TPL, we have attempted to make it easier for future researchers to study the properties of text and their various effects on marketing communications.\n12\nThe TPL dictionary is infinite and ever-expanding. From an etymological perspective, the\nnumber of words (and symbols) that we use to communicate meaning has grown exponentially with CMC. It is important to note that nonverbal cues, like verbal ones, rarely have a single denotative meaning; rather, meaning depends greatly on the social context in which the communication resides. Furthermore, the categories of TPL are generally, although not absolutely, mutually exclusive. For example, \u201c*sigh*\u201d can be interpreted as the sound of breath being exhaled forcefully (vocalization), or as the bodily movements associated with sighing, such as shrugging one\u2019s shoulders forward or physically looking down (visual kinesics). Notwithstanding examples like this, most instances of TPL are readily classifiable.\nVarious scholars acknowledge the need for more research on language in consumer\npsychology (e.g., Kronrod & Danziger, 2013; Schellekens, Verlegh, & Smidts, 2010; Sela, Wheeler, & Sarial-Abi, 2012). Krishna (2012) calls for work on the extent to which language comprehension is bodily grounded. \u201cCan a product description make something smell, feel, sound different? There is an enormous need for research exploring the effect of verbal information on sensory perception\u201d (Krishna, 2012, p. 347). Similarly, can the use of TPL alter sensory experiences? Our TPL typology provides the foundation for exploring these questions.\nAuditory, tactile, and visual TPL may be processed differently. There is evidence that\nmodality influences how attitudes are formed, remembered, and altered. Tavassoli and Fitzsimons (2006) demonstrate that attitudes expressed through oral and written communication recruit different cognitive, motor, and perceptual systems and result in the encoding of differentiated memory traces. When the same information is presented in varied contexts, multiple routes are formed in memory. Ease of encoding and response latencies in decoding the types of TPL might differ across individuals\u2019 auditory, tactile, and visual learning styles. Future\n13\nresearch should consider how the types of TPL are encoded in memory and how this affects retrieval and use of information.\nMental imagery relies on sensory experiences represented in working memory (MacInnis\n& Price, 1987), and TPL is likely to evoke strong auditory, haptic, and visual imagery. We anticipate that the different types of TPL evoke imagery corresponding to the sensory experience being conveyed, but we also know that imagery systems are interrelated, for example haptic and visual imagery can occur simultaneously (Peck, Barger, & Webb, 2013). There are also individual differences in both the ease of processing and the vividness of imagery (Childers, Houston, & Heckler, 1985). The exploration of imagery evoked by TPL thus promises to be an intriguing area of research.\nNonverbal communication may be processed by either hemisphere of the brain, although\nthe left hemisphere is thought to process more of the verbal and linguistic aspects of communication, and the right hemisphere is credited with visual/spatial relationships, Gestalt information, and the bulk of nonverbal information (Knapp et al., 2013). It would be interesting to test if visual and alphabetic TPL are processed in different regions of the brain. Perhaps characteristics of communicators, such as left vs. right brain dominance, affect the types of TPL they employ. For example, right-brain dominance may lead to more image-based TPL (e.g., emojis), whereas left-brain dominance may favor TPL that modifies words (e.g., loooooong).\nIf a consumer employs TPL while interacting with a customer service representative,\ndoes mimicry of the consumer\u2019s writing style by the representative affect what the consumer thinks of the service? We would expect so. Previous research shows that language accommodation is important for customer satisfaction (Van Vaerenbergh & Holmqvist, 2013).\n14\nConcordance or discordance in the use of TPL in conversation may affect the way a consumer perceives a brand.\nRelatedly, physical mimicry could be investigated. When a consumer is reading a\nmessage that contains TPL, does she unconsciously simulate or mimic the expression? For instance, when encountering \u201c*shrug*\u201d, do people physically shrug their shoulders? There is research to suggest that when reading auditory cues, people sound out words or imitate how they believe the words to be communicated (Ehri, 2005). We know that when we form perceptions, it is not just a cognitive process, but also an emotional (Loewenstein, 2000) and physiologic (Barsalou, 2008; Carney, Cuddy, & Yap, 2010) one.\nThere is evidence that language is embodied as well. A growing literature on linguistic\nembodiment suggests that comprehension relies on internal simulation and bodily action (Fischer & Zwaan, 2008). Recent research on phonetic embodiment finds that phonetic structure influences meaning, as in the direction of tongue movement influencing approach-avoidance tendencies (Topolinski, Maschmann, Pecher, & Winkielman, 2014) and perceptions of acceptance or rejection of a brand name (Kronrod, Lowrey, & Ackerman, working paper). Linking TPL that employs embodiment to measures such as recall and recognition would be a promising area of study.\nConceptually, this research has focused on brands\u2019 use of TPL in communications with\nconsumers. However, future research could explore what companies can understand about consumers based on their personal usage of TPL. Can we predict personality, loyalty, or engagement based on TPL? Language use is an individual difference and a meaningful way of exploring personality (Pennebaker & King, 1999). TPL could be used as a predictor of customer personality, tendencies, and behaviors, including age, gender, socioeconomic status, education\n15\nlevel, emotional intelligence, closeness of relationships, structure of networks, sentiment, and purchase behavior.\nFrom a managerial perspective, TPL is an important consideration when connecting with\nconsumers online. Choosing whom to hire to manage a brand\u2019s social presence has an immense impact on the personality of the brand. Hiring and training decisions should consider TPL, which is a facet of one\u2019s tone and \u201cvoice\u201d in online communication. For example, a customer service representative who uses online chat to address consumer complaints may need to utilize different communication strategies depending on the source, valence, and context of the message.\nOnline communication has qualities of both spoken and written language, but it is truly\nneither. Although early work on interactional and conversational research in marketing acknowledges that nonverbal factors have an immense impact on the interpretation of a marketing message, it was thought that \u201cparalanguage can be eliminated only in situations in which stimulus materials are presented in the form of written dialogue\u201d (Thomas, 1992, p. 89). It is possible for written content to be devoid of paralanguage, but this is rarely the case. Paralanguage is abundant in online communication, and its use will continue to grow with social media. Language, as the basis for human interaction (Grice, 1975), has the capacity to reveal our social and psychological selves. Textual paralanguage contains a wealth of information that marketers should be eager to explore.\n16\nReferences\nAaker, J. L. (1997). Dimensions of brand personality.

To ensure saturation of the TPL phenomenon, we collected data from consumers as well as brands. We describe the analyses we conducted on consumer tweets, brand tweets, brand at-replies, brand posts on Facebook, and brand posts on Instagram."}, {"heading": "Consumer Tweets", "text": ""}, {"heading": "To obtain a sample of public tweets, a Python program was written to collect tweets from", "text": "Twitter for analysis. Twitter is an ideal social media platform for investigating TPL, since posts are primarily textual, messages are limited to 140 characters, and programmatic access to all public tweets is possible using an application programming interface (API). To obtain a sample of all public tweets written in the English language, the program queried the Twitter Streaming with the parameter \u201clanguage=en\u201d. This was done at different times of the day (during daytime hours in the United States) over the course of several days until 5,000 tweets were acquired. This sample provides consumer-level data on how individuals use TPL.\nAfter each query, the tweets were downloaded in JSON format and saved using UTF-8\nencoding to preserve emojis and other symbols. The tweets were then imported into TAMS Analyzer, an open-source research tool, for manual coding of textual paralanguage (see Table A1 for coding guide). The coders were instructed to identify all instances of nonverbal communication in text, regardless of its fit within the existing categories. It was made clear that the purpose was to uncover whether or not the existing classification was indeed the correct one, or whether categories exist that are not captured using the current framework. The tweets were\ncoded independently by four coders, and the resulting documents were compared using Kaleidoscope. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion amongst the researchers.\nOf the 5,000 randomly sampled tweets, 4,608 (92.2%) were valid tweets. Tweets were\ncoded as not valid if they used languages other than English (0.1%), if they were generated automatically by a program (3.7%), or were spam (4%). Of the 4,608 valid tweets, 1,859 (40.3%) employed some form of TPL. Clearly how messages are written matters. The prevalence of the various types of TPL is important as well. Of the 3,097 instances of TPL, voice quality was the most common (35.4%), with visual kinesics a close second (33.7%). This was followed by artifacts (16.4%), vocalizations (11.5%), and tactile kinesics (3%)."}, {"heading": "Brand Tweets", "text": "Twitter is not only used by consumers but is also widely used by brands (King, 2008). A\nPython program was written to collect brand tweets for analysis.

All at-replies (tweets that begin with \u201c@\u201d) were excluded from this sample, since these are primarily responses to tweets from other Twitter users; in addition, at-replies are typically only seen by the intended recipient of the tweet. For comprehensiveness, however, we analyze at-replies in the following section. Retweets were also excluded, since the text of a retweet is not composed by the brand. The most recent 200 tweets for each brand were imported into TAMS Analyzer for coding. Only three of the brand accounts had fewer than 200 tweets after removing retweets and at-replies: frappuccino (N=194), starbucks (N=122), and therealpsl (N=52).

In this paper, we conceptualize textual paralanguage (TPL), which we define as written manifestations of nonverbal audible, tactile, and visual elements that supplement or replace written language and that can be expressed through words, symbols, images, punctuation, demarcations, or any combination of these elements. We develop a typology of textual paralanguage using data from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. We present a conceptual framework of antecedents and consequences of brands\u2019 use of textual paralanguage. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

In marketing, research on linguistics has focused primarily on the effects of word choice, such as the effect of explanatory words on consumption experiences (Moore, 2012), refusal words on choice (Patrick & Hagtvedt, 2012), and vowel sounds in brand names on brand preferences (Lowrey & Shrum, 2007). We also see evidence that imperative messages (e.g., \u201cBuy Now!\u201d) are more effective in uncommitted consumer-brand relationships (Moore, ZemackRugar, & Fitzsimons, working paper), and assertive statements are more effective at garnering consumer compliance for hedonic products (Kronrod, Grinstein, & Wathieu, 2012). In contrast, our work focuses not on the words said, but on the way nonverbal information is conveyed in writing. As computer-mediated communication (CMC) has become more prevalent, people have evolved new ways of communicating. Electronic messages are often imbued with nonverbal cues that signal individual characteristics, attitudes, and emotions. Indeed, various researchers recognize that people adapt to the limitations of CMC by creating surrogates for missing social cues (Byron & Baldridge, 2007; Ganster, Eimler, & Kr\u00e4mer, 2012; Walther, 1996). The primary goal of this paper is to provide a framework for the surrogates that people are using in digital communications. We define textual paralanguage (TPL) as written manifestations of nonverbal audible, tactile, and visual elements that supplement or replace written language and that can be", "creator": "Word"}}}
