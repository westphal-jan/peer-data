Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are often used to represent sentences or phrases (Sutskever et al., 2014; Kiros et al.,\n* indicates equal contribution\n2015), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are often used to represent images (Donahue et al., 2013; He et al., 2015). For tasks such as visual question answering (VQA), most approaches require joining the representation of both modalities. For combining the two vector representations (multimodal pooling), current approaches in VQA or grounding rely on concatenating vectors or applying the element-wise addition or multiplication. While this generates a joint representation, it might not be expressive enough to fully capture the complex associations between the two different modalities.\nIn this paper, we propose to rely on Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB) to get a joint representation. Bilinear pooling computes the outer product between two vectors, which allows, in contrast to element-wise multiplication, a multiplicative interaction between all elements of both vectors. Bilinear pooling models (Tenenbaum and Freeman, 2000) have recently been shown to be beneficial for finegrained classification for vision only tasks (Lin et al., 2015). However, given their high dimensional-\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n01 84\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 6\nJ un\nity (n2), bilinear pooling has so far not been widely used. In this paper, we adopt the idea from Gao et al. (2016) which shows how to efficiently compress bilinear pooling for a single modality. In this work, we discuss and extensively evaluate the extension to the multimodal case for text and visual modalities. As shown in Figure 1, Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB) is approximated by randomly projecting the image and text representations to a higher dimensional space (using Count Sketch (Charikar et al., 2002)) and then convolving both vectors efficiently by using element-wise multiplication in Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) space. We use MCB to predict answers for the VQA task and locations for the visual grounding task. For open-ended question answering, we present an architecture for VQA which uses MCB twice, once to predict spatial attention and the second time to predict the answer. For multiplechoice question answering we introduce a third MCB to relate the encoded answer to the question-image space. Additionally, we discuss the benefit of multiple attention maps and additional training data for the VQA task. To summarize, MCB is evaluated on two tasks, four datasets, and with a diverse set of ablations and comparisons to the state-of-the-art."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Multimodal pooling. Current approaches to multimodal pooling involve element-wise operations or vector concatenation. In the visual question answering domain, a number of models have been proposed. Simpler models such as iBOWIMG baseline (Zhou et al., 2015) use concatenation and fully connected layers to combine the image and question modalities. Stacked Attention Networks (Yang et al., 2015) and Spatial Memory Networks (Xu et al., 2015) use LSTMs or extract soft-attention on the image features, but ultimately use element-wise product or element-wise sums to merge modalities. D-NMN (Andreas et al., 2016a) introduced REINFORCE to dynamically create a network and use element-wise multiplication to joint attentions, and elementwise sum to predict answers. Dynamic Memory Networks (DMN) (Xiong et al., 2016) pool image and question with element-wise multiplication and addition, attending to part of image and question with a Episodic Memory Module (Kumar et al., 2015). DPPnet (Noh\net al., 2015) create a Parameter Prediction Network which learns to predict the parameters of the second last visual recognition layer dynamically from the question. Lu et al. (2016) recently proposed a model that extracts multiple co-attentions on the image and question and combines the co-attentions in a hierarchical manner using all of element-wise sums, concatenation, and fully connected layers.\nFor the visual grounding task Rohrbach et al. (2016) propose an approach where language phrase embedding are concatenated with the visual features in order to predict the attention weights over multiple bounding box proposals. Similarly, Hu et al. (2016a) concatenate phrase embeddings with visual features at different spatial locations to obtain a segmentation.\nBilinear pooling. Bilinear pooling has been applied to the fine-grained visual recognition task. Lin et al. (2015) use two CNNs to extract features from an image and combine the resulting vectors using an outer product, which is fully connected to an output layer. Gao et al. (2016) address the space and time complexity of bilinear features by viewing the bilinear transformation as a polynomial kernel. Pham and Pagh (2013) describes a method to approximate the polynomial kernel using Count Sketches and convolutions.\nJoint multimodal embeddings. In order to model similarity between two modalities many prior works have learned joint multimodal spaces, or embeddings. Some of such embeddings are based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (Hardoon et al., 2004) e.g. (Gong et al., 2014; Klein et al., 2015; Plummer et al., 2015), linear models with ranking loss (Frome et al., 2013; Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2015; Socher et al., 2014; Weston et al., 2011) or non-linear deep learning models (Kiros et al., 2014; Mao et al., 2015; Ngiam et al., 2011). Our multimodal compact bilinear pooling can be seen as a complementary operation that allows to capture different interactions between two modalities more expressively than e.g. concatenation. Consequently many embedding learning approaches could benefit from incorporating such interactions."}, {"heading": "3 Multimodal Compact Bilinear Pooling for Visual and Textual Embeddings", "text": "For the task of visual question answering (VQA) or visual grounding, we have to predict the most likely answer or location a\u0302 for a given image x and question or phrase q. This can be formulated as\na\u0302 = argmax a\u2208A\np(a|x,q; \u03b8) (1)\nwith parameters \u03b8 and the set of answers or locations A. For an image embedding x = \u039e(x) (i.e. a CNN) and question embedding q = \u2126(q) (i.e. an LSTM), we are interested in getting a good joint representation by pooling both representations. With a multimodal pooling \u03a6(x, q) that encodes the relationship between x and q well, it becomes easier to learn a classifier for Equation (1).\nIn this section, we first discuss our multimodal pooling \u03a6 for combining representations from different modalities into a single representation (Sec. 3.1) and then detail our architectures for VQA (Sec. 3.2) and visual grounding (Sec. 3.3), further explaining how we predict a\u0302 with the given image representation \u039e and text representation \u2126."}, {"heading": "3.1 Multimodal Compact Bilinear Pooling (MCB)", "text": "Bilinear models (Tenenbaum and Freeman, 2000) take the outer product of two vectors x \u2208 Rn1 and q \u2208 Rn2 and learn a model W (here linear), i.e. z = W [x\u2297 q], where \u2297 denotes the outer product (xqT ) and [ ] denotes linearizing the matrix in a vector. As discussed in the introduction, bilinear pooling is interesting because it allows all elements of both vectors to interact with each other in a multiplicative way. However, high dimensional representation\nAlgorithm 1 Multimodal Compact Bilinear 1: input: v1 \u2208 Rn1 , v2 \u2208 Rn2 2: output: \u03a6(v1, v2) \u2208 Rd 3: procedure MCB(v1, v2) 4: for i\u2190 1 . . . 2 do 5: if hi, si uninitialized then 6: for k \u2190 1 . . . ni do 7: sample hi[k] from {1, . . . , c} 8: sample si[k] from {1,\u22121} 9: v\u2032i \u2190 \u03a8(vi, hi, si) 10: \u03a6 = FFT\u22121(FFT(v\u20321) FFT(v\u20322)) 11: return \u03a6 12: procedure \u03a8(v, h, s) 13: y \u2190 [0, . . . , 0] 14: for j \u2190 1 . . . n do 15: y[h[j]]\u2190 y[h[j]] + s[j] \u00b7 v[j] 16: return y\n(i.e. when n1 and n2 are large) lead to an infeasible number of parameters to learn in W . For example, we use n1 = n2 = 2048 and z \u2208 R3000 for VQA. W thus would have 12.5 billion parameters which leads to very high memory consumption and high computation times.\nWe thus need a method that projects the outer product to a lower dimensional space and also avoids computing the outer product directly. As suggested by Gao et al. (2016) for a single modality, we rely on the count sketch projection function \u03a8 (Charikar et al., 2002), which projects a vector v \u2208 Rn to y \u2208 Rd. y is initialized to a vector of d zeros, and every element vi is multiplied by its corresponding value si \u2208 {\u22121, 1} and added to the jth element in y, where h maps indices i in v to indices j in y. The h and s vectors are initialized randomly from uniform distribution, but remain fixed.\nThis allows us to project the outer product to a lower dimensional space, which reduces the number of parameters in W . To not compute the outer product explicitly, Pham and Pagh (2013) showed that the count sketch of the outer product of two vectors can be expressed as convolution of each count sketch: \u03a8(x \u2297 q, h, s) = \u03a8(x, h, s) \u2217 \u03a8(q, h, s). Additionally, the convolution theorem states that convolution in the time domain is equivalent to element-wise multiplication in the frequency domain. The convolution x\u2032\u2217q\u2032 can be rewritten as FFT\u22121(FFT(x\u2032) FFT(q\u2032)). These ideas are summarized in Figure 2 and formal-\nized in Algorithm 1, which is based on the Tensor Sketch algorithm of Pham and Pagh (2013). We invoke the algorithm with v1 = x and v2 = q."}, {"heading": "3.2 Architectures for VQA", "text": "The input to the model is an image and a question, and the goal is to answer the question. Our model extracts representations for the image and the question, pools the vectors using MCB, and arrives at the answer by treating the problem as a multi-class classification problem with 3,000 possible classes.\nWe extract image features using a 152-layer Residual Network (He et al., 2015) that is pretrained on ImageNet data (Deng et al., 2009). Images are resized to 448\u00d7448, and we use the output of the layer (\u201cpool5\u201d) before the 1000-way classifier. We then perform L2 normalization on the vector.\nInput questions are first tokenized into words, and the words are one-hot encoded and passed through an embedding layer. The tanh nonlinearity is used after the embedding. The embedding layer is followed by a 2-layer LSTM with 1024 units in each layer. The outputs of each LSTM layer are concatenated to form a 2048-D vector. The two vectors are then passed through MCB. The MCB is followed by an elementwise signed square-root and L2 normalization. After MCB pooling, a fully connected layer connects the resulting 16,000-D multimodal representation to the 3,000 top answers.\nAttention. To incorporate spatial information, we use soft attention on our MCB pooling method. Explored by (Xu et al., 2015) for image captioning and\nby (Xu and Saenko, 2015) and (Yang et al., 2015) for VQA, the soft attention mechanism can be easily integrated to our model.\nFor each spatial grid location in the visual representation (i.e. last convolutional layer of ResNet [res5c], last convolutional layer of VGG [conv5]), we use MCB pooling to merge with the language representation. As depicted in Figure 3, after the pooling we use two convolutional layers to reduce dimensionality and apply softmax to compute weights (soft attention maps) for each grid location. The spatial vectors in the visual representation are then weighted summed to create attention vectors. As we can see from Figure 3, we experiment with generating two attention maps to allow the model to make multiple \u201cglimpses\u201d and these glimpses are concatenated before being merged with the language representation through another MCB pooling for prediction. Generating attention maps directly from the MCB pooling allows the model to effectively learn how to attend to salient locations based on both visual and language representations.\nAnswer Encoding. For VQA with multiple choices, we can additionally embed the answers. For that we base our approach on the proposed MCB with attention. As can be seen from Figure 4, to deal with multiple variable-length answer choices written in natural language, we devise an architecture in which each candidate is encoded using word embedding and LSTM layers whose weights are shared across the candidates. Unlike the MCB with attention, we use an additional MCB pooling to merge the encoded\nanswer choices and the multimodal representation of the original pipeline. The resulting embedding is projected to a classification vector with a dimension equal to the number of answers."}, {"heading": "3.3 Architecture for Visual Grounding", "text": "We base our grounding approach on the fullysupervised version of GroundeR (Rohrbach et al., 2016). The overview of our model is shown in Figure 5. The input to the model is a query natural language phrase and an image along with multiple proposal bounding boxes. The goal is to predict a bounding box which corresponds to the query phrase. We replace the concatenation of the visual representation and the encoded phrase in Grounder with MCB to combine both modalities. In contrast to Rohrbach et al. (2016), we include a linear embedding of the visual representation and L2 normalization of both input modalities, instead of batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015), which we found to be beneficial when using MCB for the grounding task."}, {"heading": "4 Evaluation on Visual Question Answering", "text": "We evaluate the benefit of MCB with a diverse set of ablations on two visual question answering datasets."}, {"heading": "4.1 Datasets", "text": "The Visual Question Answering real-image dataset (Antol et al., 2015) consists of approximately 200,000 MSCOCO images (Lin et al., 2014), with 3 questions per image and 10 answers per question.

Ac-\ncuracies for ablation experiments in this paper are reported on the test-dev data split. We use the VQA tool provided by Antol et al. (2015) for evaluation. We conducted most of our experiments on the openended real-image task. In Table 4, we also report our multiple-choice real-image scores.\nThe Visual Genome dataset (Krishna et al., 2016) uses 108,249 images from the intersection of YFCC100M (Thomee et al., 2015) and MSCOCO.

There are 1.7 million QA pairs of the 6W question types (what, where, when, who, why, and how).\nThe Visual7W dataset (Zhu et al., 2016) is a part of the Visual Genome. Visual7W adds a 7th which question category to accommodate visual answers, but we only evaluate the models on the Telling task which involves 6W questions. The natural language answers in Visual7W are in a multiple-choice format and each question comes with four answer candidates, with only one being the correct answer.

We see that MCB pooling outperforms all non-bilinear pooling methods, such as eltwise sum, concatenation, and eltwise product.\nOne could argue that the compact bilinear method simply has more parameters than the non-bilinear pooling methods, which contributes to its perfor-\nmance. We compensated for this by stacking fully connected layers (with 4096 units per layer, ReLU activation, and dropout) after the non-bilinear pooling methods to increase their number of parameters. However, even with similar parameter budgets, nonbilinear methods could not achieve the same accuracy as the MCB method. For example, the \u201cConcat + FC + FC\u201d pooling method has approximately 40962 + 40962 + 4096 \u00d7 3000 \u2248 46 million parameters, which matches the 48 million parameters available in MCB with d = 16000. However, the performance of the \u201cConcat + FC + FC\u201d method is only 57.10% compared to MCB\u2019s 59.83%.\nSection 2 in Table 1 also shows that compact bilinear pooling has no impact on accuracy compared to full bilinear pooling. Section 3 in Table 1 demonstrates that the multimodal compact bilinear layer brings improvements regardless of the image CNN used. We primarily use ResNet-152 in this paper, but MCB also improves performance if VGG-19 is used. Section 4 in Table 1 shows that our soft attention model works best with MCB pooling. In fact, attending to the Concat + FC layer has the same performance as not using attention at all, while attending the MCB layer improves performance by 2.67 points.

Approximating the bilinear feature with a 16,000-D vector yielded the highest accuracy.\nTable 3 presents results for the Visual7W multiplechoice QA task.

However, tasks such as visual question answering require combining these vector representations with each other. Approaches to multimodal pooling include element-wise multiplication or addition, as well as concatenation of the visual and textual representations. We hypothesize that these methods are not as expressive as an outer product of the visual and textual vectors. As the outer product is typically infeasible due to its high dimensionality, we instead propose utilizing Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB) to efficiently and expressively combine multimodal features. We extensively evaluate MCB on the visual question answering and grounding tasks. We consistently show the benefit of MCB over ablations without MCB. For visual question answering, we present an architecture which uses MCB twice, once for predicting attention over spatial features and again to combine the attended representation with the question representation. This model outperforms the state-of-the-art on the Visual7W dataset and the VQA challenge.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
