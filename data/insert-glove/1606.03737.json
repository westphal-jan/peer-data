INTRODUCTION\nIn the era of digital information the biggest challenge is to, from diverse and voluminous data, create means to generate knowledge and apply it with effectiveness. One of the areas that best exemplify the context described above is the urban mobility. Sensors and digital media record daily information on tracks of people, which becomes a rich input for the carrying out of studies for understanding human mobility and its impact in public transportation, for instance.\nIn this article we describe our experience in a large Brazilian metropolis within the framework of its project for Smart City. From an origin-destination matrix estimated from data about the use of smart cards in buses, we created first a complex network that represents the demand of public transportation in the city. For doing this we have developed a heuristic algorithm to rebuild the complete itinerary of the passengers of the bus system. Another network, representing the supply of public transport considering the vehicles used, the routes followed and the itinerary of the routes with their bus stops, was produced.\nThe characterization of these networks and a strategy to overlap them, lead us to fiund out mobility patterns of persons using buses and how this generated knowledge to uncover problems of the supply and demand networks of public transport such as botlenecks and/or waste of resources.\nII. RELATED WORK\nRecently a growing body of literature has been generated\ndescribing the complex networks modeling in context of air [3], rail [4] or urban bus [5] and bikes [6] transport. In\ngeneral, these studies aim to characterize the networks using\nmetrics such as the weight distribution, average path length\nand clustering coefficient. It is noteworthy mentioning the\nwork of [7] who compared the public transport system in 22\ntowns in Poland. Among other characteristics, the authors showed that the degree and weight distribution follows a\nPower Law, in particular, a Small-World one that are\nhierarchically organized.\nThe work presented in [8] is particularly relevant in this\ncontext and is complementary to our. The paper presents an\nalgorithm for detecting bottlenecks in a congested large-scale packet-switched network. The approach is based on\nestimating the per-link expected value of delay and turning\nthis expected value to a per-link weight.\nRegarding the ODM estimation, traditional methods are\nthrough large-scale sampled surveys, conducted once in every 1-2 decade. Two main disadvantages of these methods are the\nfinancial cost and obsolescence. Alternatively, models using\nthe traffic count on a set of links have been proposed. The\naccuracy of these models depends on estimation model used,\nthe input data errors and on the set of links with collected\ntraffic counts [9]. In this work we are interested in static ODM for long-time transportation planning. The Entropy\nMaximization (EM) and Information Minimization (IM)\nmodels, and statistical approaches like Maximum Likelihood\n(ML), Generalized Least Squares (GLS) and Bayesian\nInference (BI) have been mostly adopted. However, [9]\nhighlight that few realistic approaches focused on large size network applications. More recently, Artificial Neural\nNetworks for ODM estimation was applied on hypothetical\nnetworks with several constraints [10], and more studies still\nneed to be carried out for planning and designing purpose for\nlarge size networks.\nIII. REPRESENTING THE PUBLIC TRANSPORT NETWORK THROUGH A COMPLEX NETWORK"}, {"heading": "A. Data about Public Transport", "text": "For the realization of this research five datasets were used related to network of public transport of Fortaleza in Brazil. The data refer to March 2015 and comprise the following: bus stops; routes; Terminals; bus GPS; and ticket validation. The bus stops are places where passengers go on and go off the vehicles. In all, this data set has 4783 geo-referenced records. Bus routes have 359 records, which have information about the route direction and its itinerary. Bus terminals, the smallest of the data sets, as they possess only seven records, a terminal is a place designed to provide a better service in the user transshipment, various bus routes pass through terminals. The bus GPS dataset data has around 104 million records. The buses register their location every thirty seconds. In total 2034 buses circulated in Fortaleza in March 2015.\nThe user of bus in Fortaleza can use a smart card as a ticket for validating a trip. With the smart card it is possible to make connections in any point of the city as long as it is within the period of two hours since the last ticket validation. A validation occurs when the user passes his or her smart card in the bus or in a terminal validator.\nThe dataset of ticket validation refers to the month of March and has about 29 million recordings made in bus or directly at the validator of a bus terminal. The basic data are the user\u00b4s id, data and time of the validation, bus route identification, terminal identification (in case of validation in a terminal validator), and vehicle identification.\nFigure 1 illustrates the distribution of validations made in the days of March 2015. There is a pattern for days of the week, another for Saturdays (7th, 14th, 21st, 28th) and another for Sundays (1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd) and public holidays (the 19th and 25th). Practically all the days of the week that were not holidays there were approximately 1.1 million validations made, the only exceptions were the days 5 and 6, while the\nfirst there were 2.3 million validations and the second had only 838. The administrator of the database believes that there must have been some errors generating the file, for this reason, these data will be disregarded in our analysis."}, {"heading": "B. Generating the Origin-Destination Matrix", "text": "To perform the origins estimates and the user\u2019s destinations, the data already detailed previoulsly were used. The problem that we faced was that the raw data did not allow saying precisely the bus stop where the passenger got on the bus, because they contain the time that a given user validated his ticket on the bust ratchet. We had first to estimate the place where this validation was done. For this reason, we retrieved in the bus GPS dataset the latitude and the longitude where the bus was at that validation time. However, this geographical coordinate is not necessarily the origin of the passenger, since he/she may not have done the validation of the ticket at the time that got on the bus. He could, for example, have remained at the rear of the vehicle up to the moment in which the bus approached from its destination. This problem can be minimized as we detail further.\nWith regard to the destination of the user unfortunately there is no precise record that indicates where the passenger got off. However, in literature, we found some heuristics that aim at supporting the estimate of that point of going off the bus with good reliability. The first is that, in their last journey in the day, the majority of people tend to return to the point where they set off [11, 12]. That is, in a day where the passenger has made only two trips, for example, the location of the first validation corresponds to the origin and the location of the second validation has good probability of being the destination. With this you can assume with certain reliability that the pair origin and destination (OD pair) of this user in question corresponds to the ticket validation coordinates.\nThe OD pairs may still be generalized to the cases where the passengers take more than two trips in a day. If the user has made three trips in a day, you can assume that the first trip corresponds to his first origin at the day, O1, the second trip has at its validation point at the first destination, D1, and the second origin of the day, O2. The third journey, in its turn, has in its Single ticket validation location at the second destination at the day, D2, and the third the origin, O3. Closing the triangle of OD pairs, it is assumed that the user will terminate their paths of the day returning to the point of first origin in the day, which in this case would also be the destination, D3, the user. The OD pairs in this example would then be {O1, D1}, {O2, D2} and {O3, D3} where in terms of geographical coordinates D1 = O2, D2 = O3 and O1 = D3. This example exposed in this graph may be associated with the case of a citizen who, for example, leaves the house in the morning toward the location where he or she works, then in another shift, goes to the university and then back home at the end of their daily routine.\nIn [11, 12] different strategies have been proposed for the validation of origin and destination. One of them says that the behavior of a recurring user must be checked. In days equal in the week, it is expected that the user leaves the same origins to the same destinations, for example, if in almost every\nMonday of a month, a user \"X\" leaves a point P1 for a P2 and then to a point P3, it should be assumed that this is the default for moving the user \"X\" on Mondays. Then if in few Mondays it is recorded that he made only the route P1 to P3, it must be verified if these origins and destinations are correct. In this work it is verified if the route taken by the user from P1 arrives in P3, if not reached, it is verified if the same arrives in P2, and if he or she does, then it is added to the user analyzed the point P2 as an intermediary point in the itinerary. In case it is not possible to arrive in P2 from the bus route of P1, the OD is removed. This user scenario described usually occurs because possibly the user made part of the path that day by another modal such as bicycle, train or subway.\nAs it has already been mentioned, the point where the user made the ticket validation may not necessarily be the origin of the same, because this user may not have validated his or her ticket at the time that he or she got on the bus. The literature suggests [11,12] that to give more precision to these points, it must also be adopted a strategy to analyze the behavior of a recurring user. A person normally sets off from the same origins, but may have validated the ticket in different points of the bus route (capacity of the vehicle can motivate this), then it must be adjusted all the origins of the user in question to the first point of the validation found in the days analyzed. This is probably the closest point of origin of the user.\nUsing the strategies outlined in this section, the OD pairs have been generated of the bus network of Fortaleza for a week in the month of March 2015. The chosen period was from 11th (Wednesday) today 17th (Tuesday). This week has been chosen due to the absence of holidays and also due to the fact that the same does not possess the inconsistencies mentioned in section III of this work. In total, around 1.7 million OD pairs have been generated in this period."}, {"heading": "C. Statistical validation of the representativeness of the OD sample spatial", "text": "Typically, ODM are constructed via surveys with a\nsample of the users. It is expected that the samples guarantee, with a certain degree of reliability, that the ODs estimated\nare correct. A major challenge is to ensure that the sample is\nnot biased spatially, for example, that the embarkings into\nthe bus used in estimates are not proportional (considering\neach bus stop) to the total of embarkings.\nTo spatially validate the sample we have generated we\nhave checked the correlation between the embarkings used to\nestimate the OD pairs and the total of embarkings in the bus stops in Fortaleza. From the equation \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc4c \u2217 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udefd, where \ud835\udc65 represents the total of embarkings at the bus stops, \ud835\udc66 the total of embarkings used at the estimates and \ud835\udc4c is a normalization constant, we say that a linear or isometric relationship, as evidenced by the value of the exponent \ud835\udefd close to one, indicates that, proportionally, the embarkings\nused in estimates are equivalent to the total of embarkings in bus stops, noting that the samples were extracted in random\norder.\nFigure 2 shows the correlation between the sample of the\nembarkings used in the estimation of origins and destinations\nand the total of bus embarkings recorded in the period\nstudied.

Supply Transport Network", "text": "The transport infrastructure network of buses of a city is determinant in the movement of persons making the same reach their places of desire for performing daily activities. In the specific case of bus network, the nodes are bus stops and the bus routes that lead people between these bus stops are the edges. The itinerary of a route is the set of bus stops visited during a route. It is said that a route finished its itinerary when the bus reaches its last stop.\nWe can thus model a network as a directed graph, G (V, E), with vertices, v (\u2208 V), representing the bus stops and edges, e (\u2208 E), supplies between two bus stops. Formally the weight of the edge, \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\u2192\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc57, represents the bus supply between two bus stops vi and vj (\u2208 V). This supply is then calculated from the summing up of the bus routes weight, \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc56 , that pass by two bus stops. Formally \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\u2192\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc57 = \u2211 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc56=1 , where \ud835\udc41 is the total number of routes that visit, in sequence, vi and vj. In\nits turn, the weight of the bus routes, is calculated from the product of the quantity of vehicles, \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc56, by the number of times that a vehicle of this route finishes its itinerary in a day, \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56. That is, \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56. The Figure 3 illustrate the generated supply graph.\nThe concept of \"completing the itinerary\", done by a route, is fundamental in this calculation because the itineraries can have different sizes, a route that has more vehicles than another not necessarily has a higher supply. Said another way, the greater the weight of \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc56 , the more the vehicles of \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc56 pass by their itinerary\u00b4s bus stops."}, {"heading": "B. Demmand Transport Network from the passenger route", "text": "From the estimated OD matrix, we developed an algorithm to reconstruct the full path of an user in the bus network. The simplest case of route reconstruction is when the adopted route by the passenger takes him from the origin bus stop to the estimated destination. The case where there is no direct way to reach the destination by following only one route requires other heuristics. It is assumed in this case that the passenger made a connection with another line somewhere. The first problem in this situation is to identify this other line. This is trivial for cases where the connection was registered with the passage of the card in another bus indicating that it is the continuation of the route. The problem is that sometimes the connections are made at terminals where it is not necessary to make the card validation again. The passengers, who make connections at terminals, ascend the bus from the front door and do not need any card validation. One must then estimate in which terminal this connection has been made.\nIn these cases the aim is to identify the terminal(s) that are visited by both lines: leaving the source and arriving at the\ndestination. That is, if there is a terminal in common on the route of these lines, it is assumed then that the transfer was made there. As a result, the passenger path becomes the route from source to terminal and from terminal to destination. In total, more than 1.2 million full path have been generated.\nThe demand network contains all the passenger paths that have been reconstructed. The path of a passenger is represented by a bus stop sequence. Formally it is a directed\ngraph, G (V, E) with vertices v (\u2208 V), representing the bus\nstops and edges (\u2208 E) representing the flow of people. The weight of the edge, \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\u2192\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc57, totals the amount of people who passe between \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc57 .\nFigure 4 illustrates the buiding process of this network. Given an user \ud835\udc481 who makes the path containing the bus stop sequence [\ud835\udc633, \ud835\udc634, \ud835\udc635e \ud835\udc636,] and another user \ud835\udc482, with path [\ud835\udc631, \ud835\udc632, \ud835\udc634, \ud835\udc635, \ud835\udc637 e \ud835\udc638], then the weight of the edge between \ud835\udc634 and \ud835\udc635 is incremented."}, {"heading": "C. Networks Characterization", "text": "In this section we describe the characterization process of supply and demand Fortaleza bus system. To allow comparisons, edges of the weights of the two networks were normalized. In the demand network, for each edge, \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51, the weight \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc51, describing the demando f passengers between two bus stops, was normalized by the ratio \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc51/\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 where \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 is the largest weight registered on the network. For the supply network the same strategy was used for computing the weight that representes the amount of available buses. Note that both networks have the same degree distribution, i.e., for each edge in the supply network there is a corresponding edge on demand network, they differ only with respect to the weights of the edges.\nFigure 5 illustrates the weight distribution for the two networks. In Figure 5 (a) it is shown a Power Law [25,26] with exponente \u03b1 = -2.90 for the Supply network. This result suggest that this network was projected for offering a high number of resources in few places and for supplying few resources in several places. Similarly, the Power Law found for the demand network and depicted in Figure 5 (b) with\nexponente \u03b1 = -1.97 indicates that there a few places with high demand several other places with low demand.\nDespite the distributions present similarity in terms of scale, this does not necessarily imply that the networks are balanced. The first hint of imbalance is the difference between the exponents, the large volume of concentration in few places is much more intense in the supply network. Figure 6 shows the difference in slope of the estimated regressions.\nStill on the weight distributions of the networks, in Figure 7, it is illustrated the cumulative distributions of these data. The orange curve shows that the demand network accumulates more edges with small weights that the supply\nnetwork, the probabilities are equals in the two networks to edges with weight 0.16. Here is another hint of imbalance due to differences between the accumulated probabilities on both networks.\nWe have investigated also if the networks (giant component) could be divided into sub nets with high internal clustering coefficient and low connectivity with external components. This might indicate the existence of areas where the bus supply is privileged and also bottlenecks (weak links)\nbetween these areas. It was used the algorithm [15] to detect the communities. This algorithm makes use of a heuristic method based on the optimization of modularity of graphs. The modularity of a set of nodes is measured by an actual value between 0 and 1, being computed by the ratio between the quantity of edges that connect the elements of the set among themselves by the total of the edges of the set of nodes [27-31]. The algorithm can be divided in two phases that are repeated iteratively. In the first phase it is assigned a different community for each network node. Thus, in this initial split there are many communities as nodes. For each node i are considered the neighbors of i and j is evaluated the gain of modularity that occurs when moving i of their community to the community of j. The node i is then placed in the Community for which this gain is maximum, but only if this gain is positive. If no positive gain is possible, i remains in their original community. This process is applied to all nodes repeatedly until no improvement can be achieved and the first phase is thus completed. The second phase of the algorithm consists of the construction of a new network whose nodes are the communities found during the first phase. To do this, the weights of the connections between the new nodes are given by the sum of the weight of the connections between the nodes in the two corresponding communities. The connections between the nodes of the same community are represented by self-loops for this node of the new network. The phases are repeated until the maximum global modularity is found.\nFigure 8 illustrates the increased modularity when the network is divided into more communities. The modularity of the supply network is greater than the demand network in virtually all configurations. This result reveals that the supply network is designed to meet shorter movements than the fact that people need, because the modularity found in this\nnetwork indicates that there are more strong links intracommunity than those found in demand network, possibly because the users of the network travels over longer stretches, increasing the weight of the edges in these locals and preventing community detection algorithms find modular configurations such as those found in the supply network.\nIn balanced networks, where supply grows in direct proportion to the growth of demand, it is expected that there is an isometric relationship between supply and demand volumes. In Figure 9 we measure the correlation between the weights of edges of supply and demand networks. Low correlation, R\u00b2 = 0.53, reveals an imbalance between supply and demand, and that the value of \u03b2 = 1.24 reveals a allometric relationship [20-24], different from the expected isometric relationship. Above the red line (linear regression) are the edges or parts of the network, where demand is proportionally greater than the supply. However, it draws attention the highest concentration of dots below the regression line, indicating that there are parts of the city in where resources offered are, proportionally, greater than the existing demand in the region. This signals that one can best meet the demand of the network without the need to increase the operating cost of the same, just trying to balance supply in some parts of the city.\nSpatially, the city places (segments between two bus stops) where the network is potentially overloaded by demand can be seen in Figure 10. We have them created a third network, where each edge \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc51 was assigned \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc60/\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 - \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc51/\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65. Subtracting the edges of weights generates new weights with values between 1 and -1, where negative values\nindicate overload on the edge. 14.88% of the edges of Fortaleza bus network have \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc51 < 0.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThis work explored the supply and demand for bus networks in a case study with a large Brazilian metropolis. Models and metrics of complex networks have been used to understand the dynamics of urban mobility. Our main contribution is THE propose a model based on complex networks with potential to discover bottlenecks and resource waste in bus networks in big cities.\nSecondary contributions of this work are, first, the\nreconstruction and statistical validation of the origins and\ndestinations of users from public data bus GPS and, second,\nthe reconstruction of paths of users within the bus system\nmaking use of heuristics based on the behavior of these\nusers."}], "references": [{"title": "The strategy of urban acupuncture.\" Structure Fabric and Topography Conference, Nanjing", "author": ["M.
