Not surprisingly, there is an increasing interest in developing methods for extractive summarization for meetings and conversations (Zechner, 2002; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2005; Galley, 2006; Lin and Chen, 2010; Murray et al., 2010a). Carenini et al. (2011) describe the specific need for focused summaries of meetings, i.e., summaries of a particular aspect of a meeting rather than of the meeting as a whole. For example, the decisions made, the action items that emerged and the problems arised are all important outcomes of meetings. In particular, decision summaries would allow participants to review decisions from previous meetings and understand the related topics quickly, which facilitates preparation for the upcoming meetings.\nMeeting conversation is intrinsically different from well-written text, as meetings may not be well organized and most utterances have low density of salient content. Therefore, multiple problems need to be addressed for speech summarization. Consider the sample dialogue snippet in Figure 1 from the AMI meeting corpus (Carletta et al., 2005). Only decision-related dialogue acts (DRDAs) \u2014 utter-\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n07 82\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n4 Ju\nn 20\nances at least one decision made in the meeting1 \u2014 are listed and ordered by time. Each DRDA is labeled numerically according to the decision it supports; so the second and third utterances (in bold) support DECISION 2, as do the fifth utterance in the snippet. Manually constructed decision abstracts for each decision are shown at the bottom of the figure.\nBesides the prevalent dialogue phenomena (such as \u201cUh I\u2019m kinda liking\u201d in Figure 1), disfluencies and off-topic expressions, we notice that single utterance is usually not informative enough to form a decision. For instance, no single DRDA associated with DECISION 4 corresponds all that well with its decision abstract: \u201cpushbuttons\u201d, \u201cmenu button\u201d and \u201cPre-set channels\u201d are mentioned in separate DAs. As a result, extractive summarization methods that select individual utterance to form the summary will perform poorly.\nFurthermore, it is difficult to identify the core topic when multiple topics are discussed in one utterance. For example, all of the bold DRDAs supporting DECISION 2 contain the word \u201clatex\u201d. However, the last DA in bold also mentions \u201cbigger impact\u201d and \u201cthe scroll wheel\u201d, which are not specifically relevant for DECISION 2. Though this problem can be approached by training a classifier to identify the relevant phrases and ignore the irrelevant ones or dialogue phenomena, it needs expensive human annotation and is limited to the specific domain.\nNote also that for DECISION 4, the \u201cpower button\u201d is not specified in any of the listed DRDAs supporting it. By looking at the transcript, we find \u201cpower button\u201d mentioned in one of the preceding, but not decision-related DAs. Consequently another challenge would be to add complementary knowledge when the DRDAs cannot provide complete information.\nTherefore, we need a summarization approach that is tolerant of dialogue phenomena, can determine the key semantic content and is easily transferable between domains. Recently, topic modeling approaches have been investigated and achieved state-of-the-art results in multi-document summarization (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009; Celiky-\n1These DRDAs are annotated in the AMI corpus and usually contain the decision content. They are similar, but not completely equivalent, to the decision dialogue acts (DDAs) of Bui et al. (2009), Ferna\u0301ndez et al. (2008), Frampton et al. (2009).\nilmaz and Hakkani-Tur, 2010). Thus, topic models appear to better ref for document similarity w.r.t. semantic concepts than simple literal word matching. However, very little work has investigated its role in spoken document summarization (Chen and Chen, 2008; Hazen, 2011), and much less conducted comparisons among topic modeling approaches for focused summarization in meetings.\nIn contrast to previous work, we study the unsupervised token-level decision summarization in meetings by identifying a concise set of key words or phrases, which can either be output as a compact summary or be a starting point to generate abstractive summaries. This paper addresses problems mentioned above and make contributions as follows:\n\u2022 As a step towards creating the abstractive summaries that people prefer when dealing with spoken language (Murray et al., 2010b), we propose a token-level rather than sentence-level framework for identifying components of the summary. Experimental results show that, compared to the sentence ranking based summarization algorithms, our token-level summarization framework can better identify the summary-worthy words and remove the redundancies.\n\u2022 Rather than employing supervised learning methods that rely on costly manual annotation, we explore and evaluate topic modeling approaches of different granularities for the unsupervised decision summarization at both the token-level and dialogue act-level. We investigate three topic models \u2014 Local LDA (LocalLDA) (Brody and Elhadad, 2010), Multi-grain LDA (MG-LDA) (Titov and McDonald, 2008) and Segmented Topic Model (STM) (Du et al., 2010) \u2014 which can utilize the latent topic structure on utterance level instead of document level. Under our proposed token-level summarization framework, three finegrained models outperform the basic LDA model and two extractive baselines that select the longest and the most representative utterance for each decision, respectively. (ROUGE-SU4 F score of 14.82% for STM vs. 13.58% and 13.46% for the baselines, given the perfect clusterings of DRDAs.)\n\u2022 In line with prior research that explore the role of context for utterance-based extractive summariza-\ntion (Murray and Renals, 2007), we investigate the role of context in our token-level summarization framework. For the given clusters of DRDAs, We study two types of context information \u2014 the DAs preceding and succeeding a DRDA and DAs of high TF-IDF similarity with a DRDA. We also investigate two ways to select relevant words from the context DA. Experimental results show that two types of context have comparable effect, but selecting words from the dominant topic of the center DRDA performs better than from the dominant topic of the context DA. Moreover, by leveraging context, the recall exceeds the provided upperbound\u2019s recall (ROUGE-1 recall: 48.10% vs. 45.05% for upperbound by using DRDA only) although the F scores decrease after adding context information. Finally, we show that when the true DRDA clusterings are not available, adding context can improve both the recall and F score."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Speech and dialogue summarization has become important in recent years as the number of multimedia resources containing speech has grown. A primary goal for most speech summarization systems is to account for the special characteristics of dialogue. Early work in this area investigated supervised learning methods, including maximum entropy, conditional random fields (CRFs), and support vector machines (SVMs) (Buist et al., 2004; Galley, 2006; Xie et al., 2008). For unsupervised methods, maximal marginal relevance (MMR) is investigated in (Zechner, 2002) and (Xie and Liu, 2010). Gillick et al. (2009) introduce a conceptbased global optimization framework by using integer linear programming (ILP).\nOnly in very recent works has decision summarization been addressed in (Ferna\u0301ndez et al., 2008), (Bui et al., 2009) and (Wang and Cardie, 2011). (Ferna\u0301ndez et al., 2008) and (Bui et al., 2009) utilize semantic parser to identify candidate phrases for decision summaries and employ SVM to rank those phrases. They also train HMM and SVM directly on a set of decision-related dialogue acts on token level and use the classifiers to identify summary-worthy words. Wang and Cardie (2011) provide an exploration on supervised and unsupervised learning for decision summarization on both\nutterance- and token- level. Our work also arises out of applying topic models to text summarization (Bhandari et al., 2008; Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009; Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur, 2010; Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur, 2010). Mostly, the sentences are ranked according to importance based on latent topic structures, and top ones are selected as the summary. There are some works for applying document-level topic models to speech summarization (Kong and shan Leek, 2006; Chen and Chen, 2008; Hazen, 2011). Different from their work, we further investigate the topic models of fine granularity on sentence level and leverage context information for decision summarization task.\nMost existing approaches for speech summarization result in a selection of utterances from the dialogue, which cannot remove the redundancy within utterances. To eliminate the superfluous words, our work is also inspired by keyphrase extraction of meetings (Liu et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2011) and keyphrase based summarization (Riedhammer et al., 2010). However, a small set of keyphrases are not enough to concretely display the content. Instead of only picking up keyphrases, our work identifies all of the summary-worthy words and phrases, and removes redundancies within utterances."}, {"heading": "3 Summarization Frameworks", "text": "In this section, we first present our proposed tokenlevel decision summarization framework \u2014 DomSum \u2014 which utilizes latent topic structure in utterances to extract words from Dominant Topic (see details in Section 3.1) to form Summaries. In Section 3.2, we describe four existing sentence scoring metrics denoted as OneTopic, MultiTopic, TMMSum and KLSum which are also based on latent topic distributions. We adopt them to the utterance-level summarization for comparison in Section 6."}, {"heading": "3.1 Token-level Summarization Framework", "text": "Domsum takes as input the clusters of DRDAs (with or without additional context DAs), the topic distribution for each DA and the word distribution for each topic. The output is a set of topic-coherent summary-worthy words which can be used directly as the summary or to further generate abstractive summary. We introduce DomSum in two steps according to its input: taking clusters of DRDAs as the input and with additional context information.\nDRDAs Only. Given clusters of DRDAs, we use Algorithm 1 to produce the token-level summary for each cluster. Generally, Algorithm 1 chooses the topic with the highest probability as the dominant topic given the dialogue act (DA). Then it collects the words with a high joint probability with the dominant topic from that DA.\nInput : Cluster C = {DAi}, P (Tj |DAi), P (wk|Tj) Output: Summary\nSummary\u2190 \u03a6 (empty set) foreach DAi in C do\nDomTopic\u2190 maxTj P (Tj |DAi) (*) Candidate\u2190 \u03a6 foreach word wk in DAi do\nSampleTopic\u2190 maxTj P (wk|Tj)P (Tj |DAi) if DomTopic == SampleTopic then\nCandidate\u2190 Union(Candidate, wk) end\nend Summary\u2190 Union(Summary, Candidate)\nend\nAlgorithm 1: DomSum \u2014 The token-level summarization framework. DomSum takes as input the clusters of DRDAs and related probability distributions.\nLeveraging Context. For each DRDA (denoted as \u201ccenter DA\u201d), we study two types of context information (denoted as \u201ccontext DAs\u201d). One is adjacent DAs, i.e., immediately preceding and succeeding DAs, the other is the DAs having top TF-IDF similarities with the center DA. Context DAs are added into the cluster the corresponding center DA in.\nWe also study two criteria of word selection from the context DAs. For each context DA, we can take the words appearing in the dominant topic of either this context DA or its center DRDA. We will show in Section 6.1 that the latter performs better as it produces more topic-coherent summaries. Algorithm 1 can be easily modified to leverage context DAs by updating the input clusters and assigning the proper dominant topic for each DA accordingly \u2014 this changes the step (\u2217) in Algorithm 1."}, {"heading": "3.2 Utterance-level Summarization Metrics", "text": "We also adopt four sentence scoring metrics based on the latent topic structure for extractive summarization. Though they are developed on different topic models, given the desired topic distributions as input, they can rank the utterances according to their importance and provide utterance-level summaries for comparison.\nOneTopic and MultiTopic. In (Bhandari et al., 2008), several sentence scoring functions are introduced based on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing. We adopt two metrics, which are OneTopic and MultiTopic. For OneTopic, topic T with highest probability P (T ) is picked as the central topic per cluster C. The score for DA in C is:\nP (DA|T ) = \u2211 w\u2208DA P (T |DA,w)\u2211\nDA\u2032\u2208C,w\u2208DA\u2032 P (T |DA\u2032, w) ,\nMultiTopic modifies OneTopic by taking all of the topics into consideration. Given a cluster C, DA in C is scored as: \u2211 T P (DA|T )P (T ) = \u2211 T \u2211 w\u2208DA P (T |DA,w)\u2211 DA\u2032\u2208C,w\u2208DA\u2032 P (T |DA\u2032, w) P (T )\nTMMSum. Chen and Chen (2008) propose a Topical Mixture Model (TMM) for speech summarization, where each dialogue act is modeled as a TMM for generating the document. TMM is shown to provide better utterance-level extractive summaries for spoken documents than other conventional unsupervised approaches, such as Vector Space Model (VSM) (Gong and Liu, 2001), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Gong and Liu, 2001) and Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) (Murray et al., 2005). The importance of a sentence S can be measured by its generative probability P (D|S), where D is the document S belongs to. In our experiments, one decision is made per cluster of DAs. So we adopt their scoring metric to compute the generative probability of the cluster C for each DA:\nP (C|DA) = \u220f wi\u2208C \u2211 Tj P (wi|Tj)P (Tj |DA),\nKLSum. Kullback-Lieber (KL) divergence is explored for summarization in (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009) and (Lin et al., 2010), where it is used to measure the distance of distributions between the document and the summary. For a cluster C of DAs, given a length limit \u03b8, a set of DAs S is selected as:\nS\u2217 = arg min S:|S|<\u03b8 KL(PC ||PS) = arg min S:|S|<\u03b8 \u2211 Ti P (Ti|C)log P (Ti|C) P (Ti|S)"}, {"heading": "4 Topic Models", "text": "In this section, we briefly describe the three finegrained topic models employed to compute the latent topic distributions on utterance level in the\nmeetings.

We evaluate our approach on the AMI meeting corpus (Carletta et al., 2005) that consists of 140 multi-party meetings. The 129 scenariodriven meetings involve four participants playing different roles on a design team. A short (usually one-sentence) abstract is manually constructed to summarize each decision discussed in the meeting and used as gold-standard summaries in our experiments.\nSystem Inputs. Our summarization system requires as input a partitioning of the DRDAs according to the decision(s) that each supports (i.e., one cluster of DRDAs per decision). As mentioned earlier, we assume for all experiments that the DRDAs for each meeting have been identified. For evaluation we consider two system input settings. In the True Clusterings setting, we use the AMI annotations to create perfect partitionings of the DRDAs as the input; in the System Clusterings setting, we employ a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm used for this task in previous work (Wang and Cardie, 2011). The Wang and Cardie (2011) clustering method groups DRDAs according to their LDA topic distribution similarity. As better approaches for DRDA clustering become available, they could be employed instead.\nEvaluation Metric. To evaluate the performance of various summarization approaches, we use the widely accepted ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) metrics. We use the stemming option of the ROUGE software at http://berouge.com/ and remove stopwords from both the system and gold-standard summaries, same as Riedhammer et al. (2010) do.\nInference and Hyperparameters We use the implementation from (Lu et al., 2011) for the three topic models in Section 4. The collapsed Gibbs Sampling approach (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) is exploited for inference. Hyperparameters are chosen according to (Brody and Elhadad, 2010), (Titov and McDonald, 2008) and (Du et al., 2010). In LDA and LocalLDA, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are both set to 0.1 . For MG-LDA, \u03b1gl, \u03b1loc and \u03b1mix are set to 0.1; \u03b3 is 0.1\nand the window size T is 3. And the number of local topic is set as the same number of global topic as discussed in (Titov and McDonald, 2008). In STM, \u03b1, a and b are set to 0.5, 0.1 and 1, respectively."}, {"heading": "5.1 Baselines and Comparisons", "text": "We compare our token-level summarization framework based on the fine-grained topic models to (1) two unsupervised baselines, (2) token-level summarization by LDA, (3) utterance-level summarization by Topical Mixture Model (TMM) (Chen and Chen, 2008), (4) utterance-level summarization based on the fine-grained topic models using existing metrics (Section 3.2), (5) two supervised methods, and (6) an upperbound derived from the AMI gold standard decision abstracts. (1) and (6) are described below, others will be discussed in Section 6.\nThe LONGEST DA Baseline. As in (Riedhammer et al., 2010) and (Wang and Cardie, 2011), this baseline simply selects the longest DRDA in each cluster as the summary. Thus, it performs utterance-level decision summarization. This baseline and the next allow us to determine summary quality when summaries are restricted to a single utterance.\nThe PROTOTYPE DA Baseline. Following Wang and Cardie (2011), the second baseline selects the decision cluster prototype (i.e., the DRDA with the largest TF-IDF similarity with the cluster centroid) as the summary.\nUpperbound. We also compute an upperbound that reflects the gap between the best possible extractive summaries and the human-written abstracts according to the ROUGE score: for each cluster of DRDAs, we select the words that also appear in the associated decision abstract."}, {"heading": "6 Results and Discussion", "text": "6.1 True Clusterings How do fine-grained topic models compare to basic topic models or baselines? Figure 2 demonstrates that by using the DomSum token-level summarization framework, the three fine-grained topic models uniformly outperform the two non-trivial baselines and TMM (Chen and Chen, 2008) (reimplemented by us) that generates utterance-level summaries. Moreover, the fine-grained models also beat basic LDA under the same DomSum token-level summarization framework. This shows the fine-\ngrained topic models that discover topic structures on utterance-level better identify gist information.\nCan the proposed token-level summarization framework better identify important words and remove redundancies than utterance selection methods? Figure 3 demonstrates the comparison results for our DomSum token-level summarization framework with four existing utterance scoring metrics discussed in Section 3.2, namely OneTopic, MultiTopic, TMMSum and KLSum. The utterance with highest score is extracted to form the summary. LocalLDA and STM are utilized to compute the input distributions, i.e., P (T |DA) and P (w|T ). From Figure 3, DomSum yields the best F scores which\nshows that the token-level summarization approach is more effective than utterance-level methods.\nWhich way is better for leveraging context information? We explore two types of context information. For adjacent content (Adj in Figure 4), 5 DAs immediately preceding and 5 DAs succeeding the center DRDA are selected. For TF-IDF context (TFIDF in Figure 4), 10 DAs of highest TF-IDF similarity with the center DRDA are taken. We also explore two ways to extract summary-worthy words from the context DA \u2014 selecting words from the dominant topic of either the center DA (denoted as \u201cOne\u201d in parentheses in Figure 4) or the current context DA (denoted as \u201cmulti\u201d in parentheses in Fig-\nure 4). Figure 4 indicates that the two types of context information do not have significant difference, while selecting the words from the dominant topic of the center DA results in better ROUGE-SU4 F scores. Notice that compared with Figure 3, the results in Figure 4 have lower F scores when using the true clusterings of DRDAs. This is because context DAs bring in relevant words as well as noisy information. We will show in Section 6.2 that when true clusterings are not available, the context information can boost both recall and F score.\nHow do the token-level summarization framework compared to utterance selection methods for leveraging context? We also compare the ability of leveraging context of DomSum to utterance scoring metrics, i.e., OneTopic and MultiTopic. 5 DAs preceding and 5 DAs succeeding the center DA are added as context information. For context DA under DomSum, we select words from the dominant topic of the center DA (denoted as \u201cOne\u201d in parentheses in Figure 5). For OneTopic and MultiTopic, the top 3 DAs are extracted as the summary. Figure 5 demonstrates the combination of LocalLDA and STM with each of the metrics. DomSum, as a token-level summarization metrics, dominates other two metrics in leveraging context.\nHow do our approach perform when compared with supervised learning approaches? For a better comparison, we also provide summarization results by using supervised systems along with an upperbound. We use Support Vector Machines (Joachims, 1998) with RBF kernel and order1 Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) \u2014 trained with the same features as (Wang and Cardie, 2011) to identify the summary-worthy tokens to include in the abstract. A three-fold cross validation is conducted for both methods. ROUGE1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4 scores are listed in Table 1. From Table 1, our token-level summarization approaches based on LocalLDA and STM are shown to outperform the baselines and even the CRF. Meanwhile, by adding context information, both LocalLDA and STM can get better ROUGE-1 recall than the supervised methods, even higher than the provided upperbound which is computed by only using DRDAs. This shows the DomSum framework can leverage context to compensate the summaries."}, {"heading": "6.2 System Clusterings", "text": "Results using the System Clusterings (Table 2) present similar findings, though all of the system and baseline scores are lower.
