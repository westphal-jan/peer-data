The majority forms of the poetry in Tang and Song were Shi (\u8a69) and Ci (\u8a5e), respectively. Tang Shi and Song Ci established crucial foundations of the Chinese literature, and their influences in both literary works and daily lives of the Chinese communities last until today. Recognizing the importance of Tang Shi, a Chinese emperor of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), Kangxi, ordered to compile a collection of Tang poems, Quan-Tang-Shi (QTS, \u5168\u5510\u8a69). QTS contains nearly 50 thousand works of about 2200 poets. A similar effort for compiling a collection of Song Ci from the private sector began in the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), and achieved in a collection called Quan-Song-Ci (QSC, \u5168\u5b8b\u8a5e) in the early Republican period of China (ca. 1937). QSC contains around 20 thousand works of about 1330 poets. The exact statistics about QTS and QSC may vary slightly depending on the sources. In the past more than a thousand years, literary and linguistic researchers have had done a myriad of research about the poetry of the Tang and Song dynasties.

In this presentation, we will discuss some interesting findings in some quantitative analyses of QTS and QSC."}, {"heading": "Colors and Imageries", "text": "Colors are an important ingredient in everyday lives, and actually carried important meanings in religion and social statuses in pre-modern Chinese societies. Wong, a specialist in colors, discusses hidden meanings of colors in China in his book on \u201cThe colors of China\u201d6. The beauty and imageries conveyed in the poetry originate from the collocations of the written words in the poems. Lo7 and Huang8 attempt to classify terms in the poetry by their semantic categories. The results can then serve as a foundation for analyzing the imageries hidden in the poems. Liu9 and his colleagues emphasize that colors play a crucial role in painting the imaginaries of poems: \u201ccolors in poems are like audios in movies\u201d, and they analyze the words related to colors in QTS. Using methods for text analysis, one may analyze occurrences and collocations of colors in QTS and QCS. The main contribution of our work will be illustrating meaningful applications of text analysis for linguistics and literary. The collocations of color words that appeared frequently in QTS are certainly interesting9. Yet, the analysis can be extended in at least two directions. First, did a poet have specific preferences on some collocations? Second, how were the collocations used by different authors? Bai Juyi10 has the largest number of works in QTS. He used \u201c\u767d\u9aee\u201d11 with \u201c\u9752\u886b\u201d11, \u201c\u9752\u96f2\u201d11, \u201c\u4e39\u7802\u201d11, and \u201c\u9752\u5c71\u201d11, and \u201c\u767d\u9996\u201d11 with \u201c\u9752\u5c71\u201d and \u201c\u7d05\u5875\u201d11 relatively often. Liu Changqin10 , another important poet in the mid Tang period, used \u201c\u767d\u9aee\u201d with \u201c\u6ec4\u6d32\u201d11, and \u201c\u767d\u9996\u201d with \u201c\u9752 \u5c71\u201d, \u201c\u6ec4\u6d32\u201d, and \u201c\u9752\u6625\u201d11 relatively often. These different words and collocations convey the imagery of \u201caging\u201d, and the variations in the word choices shed light on the subtle differences between the poets about how they expressed emotions about aging.\n5 Lee, John (\u674e\u601d\u6e90) (2012) \u201cA classical Chinese corpus with nested part-of-speech tags,\u201d Proc. of the 6th EACL\nWorkshop on Language Technology for Cultural Heritage, Social Sciences, and Humanities, 75\u201384. 6 Wong, Yan T.

Collocating with different words would create different imageries in the poems, e.g., \u201c\u9ec3\u8449\u201d13, \u201c\u6ec4\u6d77\u201d14, \u201c\u6e05\u9732\u201d15, and \u201c\u6d41\u6c34\u201d16. Each of these collocations may brew a different scene in readers\u2019 minds, and some of these collocations are more popular than other. It should be interesting for researchers to extract the source poems17 from the QTS to thoroughly study them. Liu et al. reported that white (\u201c\u767d\u201d) is the most frequent color in QTS9. We may check and find that red (\u201c\u7d05\u201d) is the most frequent color in QCS. It is interesting to investigate the changes (and their causes) of the popular colors from QTS to QCS. Again, using text analysis methods, we can find a good approximation of the trend, though obtaining the precise frequencies of the colors requires the techniques of word sense disambiguation (WSD). For instance, \u201c\u91d1\u201d18 could represent a material or a color, so WSD is necessary to achieve precise statistics. In QSC, the most frequent six colors are in the order of \u201c\u7d05\u201d, \u201c\u9752\u201d, \u201c\u9ec3\u201d, \u201c\u7da0\u201d, \u201c\u767d\u201d, and \u201c\u78a7\u201d19, while, in QTS, the most frequent six colors are \u201c\u767d\u201d, \u201c\u9752\u201d, \u201c\u7d05\u201d, \u201c\u9ec3\u201d, \u201c\u78a7\u201d, and \u201c\u7da0\u201d. \u201c\u7d05\u5875\u201d, \u201c\u6b98\u7d05\u201d, \u201c\u7d05\u599d\u201d, \u201c\u7d05\u8449\u201d, \u201c\u7d05\u8896\u201d, \u201c\u7d05\u65e5\u201d, and \u201c\u7d05\u6a13\u201d20 are some of the most frequent red words in QSC. The changes in the dominant colors from QTS to QSC may be a result of the selection process and may be a result of the cultural shift, and is an academically interesting issue to purse further.\nWord Inventions and Influences\nLiu and Wang21 propose a method to measure and compare the influences of the poems of a poet. Their methods consider whether or not the poems were selected to be included in famous collections. While our goal is not to challenge Liu and Wang\u2019s viewpoint, we would propose to consider also whether poets created new words that were used by later Chinese generations. Isn\u2019t it practically meaningful and academically significant to create new words that future generations continue to use? At the time of Tang and Song, poets were at an excellent stage of the Chinese history to achieve such a cultural impact.\n12 \u767d\u96f2: bai yun, white cloud 13 Collocations of \u201c\u767d\u96f2\u201d and \u201c\u9ec3\u8449\u201d (huang2 ye4, yellow leaves) appeared in poems of \u5289\u9577\u537f(4 times), \u76e7\u7db8(1), \u5e38\u889e(1), and \u8cc8\u5cf6(1). 14 Collocations of \u201c\u767d\u96f2\u201d and \u201c\u6ec4\u6d77\u201d (cang1 hai3, broad ocean) appeared in poems of \u5289\u9577\u537f(4), \u59da\u5408(1), \u5d14\u5cd2(1), and \u8cc8\u5cf6(1). 15 Collocations of \u201c\u767d\u96f2\u201d and \u201c\u6e05\u9732\u201d (qing1 lou4, light dew) appeared in poems of\u6b0a\u5fb7\u8f3f(1) and \u8cc8\u5cf6(1). 16 Collocations of \u201c\u767d\u96f2\u201d and \u201c\u6d41\u6c34\u201d (liu2 shui3, running water) appeared in poems of\u5289\u79b9\u932b(1), \u59da\u5408(1), \u7687\u752b\u5189(1), \u7687\u752b\u66fe(1), \u8cc8\u5cf6(1), and\u9322\u8d77(1). 17 Two examples by \u5289\u9577\u537f: \u201c\u767d\u96f2\u7559\u6c38\u65e5\uff0c\u9ec3\u8449\u6e1b\u9918\u5e74\u201d and \u201c\u8fd1\u5317\u59cb\u77e5\u9ec3\u8449\u843d\uff0c\u5411\u5357\u7a7a\u898b\u767d\u96f2\u591a\u201d. 18 \u91d1: jin1, gold 19 \u767d: bai1, white; \u9752: qing1, blue; \u7d05: hong2, red; \u9ec3: huang1, yellow; \u78a7: bi4, green; \u7da0: lu4, green 20 \u7d05\u5875: hong2 chen2; \u6b98\u7d05: can2 hong2; \u7d05\u599d: hong2 zhuang1; \u7d05\u8449: hong2 ye4; \u7d05\u8896: hong2 xui4; \u7d05\u65e5: hong2\nri4; \u7d05\u6a13: hong2 lou2 21 Liu, Zunming (\u5289\u5c0a\u660e) and Zhaopeng Wang (2012) Quantitative Analysis of Ci in Tang and Song Dynasties, Beijing:\nPeking University Press.\nWe conduct an analysis of frequent bigrams in QTS and QSC, and compare the differences. Words that appeared only in QSC are candidates of new words which were invented in Song dynasty. Words that appeared only in QTS are candidates of words that failed to survive in Chinese language. Although this process does not really guarantee a water-proof theoretical foundation for word invention, the findings should still serve as a persuasive factor in linguistic, literary, or historical research. Here are some of such findings. \u201c\u7d05\u5875\u201d22 appeared in both QTS and QSC. \u201c\u60fa\u5fea\u201d22 is a word that appeared in QSC23 but not in QTS, and is still being used in modern Chinese. \u201c\u7a7a\u9580\u201d22 is a word that appeared in QTS but not in QSC, and is being used in Chinese. \u201c\u6b66\u7687\u201d22 is a word that appeared in QTS but not in QSC, and is not normally used in Chinese. \u201c\u9174\u91be\u201d24 represents another type of instance. This word appeared much often in QSC than in QTS."}, {"heading": "Discussions", "text": "A major challenge in analyzing the words in Chinese poetry is word segmentation. Traditional experience indicates that most words in poetry consist of one or two characters25. Relying on this heuristic, we can algorithmically analyze the corpora containing about 4.9 million characters at least approximately. To really understand and appreciate the poetry, one should not read them verbatim. Metaphor recognition can be essential for revealing the real intentions of the poets. Observations resulting from quantitative analysis of QTS and QSC open windows to promising research opportunities about QTS, QSC, and their transition. In addition to colors, terms about astronomical objects, floral entities, meteorological phenomena, and geographical sights, are important participants in poetry. Innovative collocations of them paint impressive imageries in readers\u2019 minds.
