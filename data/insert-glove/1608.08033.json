Introduction", "text": "Extending logical systems of mathematical fuzzy logic (MFL) with hedges is axiomatized by Ha\u0301jek [1], Vychodil [2], Esteva et al. [3], among others. Hedges are called truthstressing or truth-depressing if they, respectively, strengthen or weaken the meaning of the applied proposition. Intuitively, on a chain of truth values, the truth function of a truth-depressing (resp., truth-stressing) hedge (connective) is a superdiagonal (resp., subdiagonal) non-decreasing function preserving 0 and 1. In [1, 2, 3], logical systems of MFL are extended by a truth-stressing hedge and/or a truth-depressing one.\nNevertheless, in the real world, humans often use many hedges, e.g., very, highly, rather, and slightly, simultaneously to express different levels of emphasis. Furthermore, a hedge may or may not have a dual one, e.g., slightly (resp., rather) can be seen as a dual hedge of very (resp., highly). Therefore, in [4, 5], Le et al. propose two axiomatizations for propositional logical systems of MFL with many hedges. In the axiomatization in [5], each hedge does not have any dual one whereas in the axiomatization in [4], each hedge can have its own dual one. In [5, 6], logical systems with many hedges for representing and reasoning with linguistically-expressed human knowledge are also proposed.\nFuzzy logic in narrow sense with graded syntax (FLn) is introduced by Nova\u0301k et al. in [7]. In FLn, both syntax and semantics are evaluated by degrees. The graded approach to syntax can be seen as an elegant and natural generalization of classical logic for inference under vagueness since it allows one to explicitly represent and reason with partial truth, i.e., proving partially true conclusions from partially true premises, and it enjoys the Pavelka-style completeness. In this paper, we extend FLn with many hedges in order to provide a foundation for human knowledge representation and reasoning in the presence of vagueness since linguistic hedges are very often used by humans and play a very important\nar X\niv :1\n60 8.\n08 03\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 9\nA ug\n2 01\n6\nrole in the modification of fuzzy predicates. FLn is extended in two cases: (i) each hedge does not have a dual one, and (ii) each hedge can have its own dual one. We show that the resulting logics also have the Pavelka-style completeness.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of notions and results of FLn. Section 3 presents two extensions of FLn with many hedges. In one case, each hedge does not have any dual one, and in the other, each hedge can have its own dual one. The resulting logics are also shown to have the Pavelka-style completeness. Section 4 concludes the paper."}, {"heading": "2. Fuzzy Logic in Narrow Sense", "text": "FLn [7] is truth functional. A compound formula is built from its constituents using a logical connective. The truth value of a compound formula is a function of the truth values of its constituents. The function is called the truth function of the connective.\nThe set of truth values forms a residuated lattice, and more precisely, a Lukasiewicz algebra (or MV-algebra) L = \u3008L,\u2228,\u2227,\u2297,\u21d2, 0, 1\u3009, where L = [0, 1], in which:\n(i) \u3008L,\u2228,\u2227, 0, 1\u3009 is a lattice with the ordering\u2264 defined using the operations \u2228 (supremum), \u2227 (infimum) as usual, and 0, 1 are its least and the greatest elements, respectively;\n(ii) The operations \u2297 and \u21d2 are Lukasiewicz conjunction and implication defined by a\u2297 b = 0\u2228 (a+ b\u2212 1) and a\u21d2 b = 1\u2227 (1\u2212 a+ b), respectively. Thus, a \u2264 b iff a\u21d2 b = 1. They satisfy the residuation property [8]: a\u2297 b \u2264 c iff a \u2264 b\u21d2 c.\nThe language J of FLn consists of: (a) a countable set V ar of object variables x, y, . . . ; (b) a finite or countable set of object constants u1,u2, . . . ; (c) a finite or countable set Func of functional symbols f, g, . . . ; (d) a nonempty finite or countable set Pred of predicate symbols P,Q, . . . ; (e) logical constants a for all a \u2208 L; (f ) implication connective \u2192; (g) general quantifier \u2200; and (h) various types of brackets as auxiliary symbols.\nTerms are defined as follows: (i) a variable x or constant u is a (atomic) term; (ii) if f be an n-ary functional symbol and tl, . . . , tn terms, then f(tl, . . . , tn) is a term.\nFormulae are defined as follows: (a) logical constants a are a formula; (b) if P is an n-ary predicate symbol, and tl, . . . , tn are terms, then P (tl, . . . , tn) is a formula; (c) if A,B are formulae, then A \u2192 B is a formula; and (d) if x is a variable, and A is a formula, then (\u2200x)A is a formula. Other connectives and formulae are defined as follows:\n\u00acA \u2261 A\u2192 0 (negation); A&B \u2261 \u00ac(A\u2192 \u00acB) ( Lukasiewicz conjunction); A \u2228B \u2261 (B \u2192 A)\u2192 A (disjunction); AOB \u2261 \u00ac(\u00acA&\u00acB) ( Lukasiewicz disjunction);\nA \u2227B \u2261 \u00ac((B \u2192 A)\u2192 \u00acB) (conjunction); A\u2194 B \u2261 (A\u2192 B) \u2227 (B \u2192 A) (equivalence); An \u2261 A&A& . . .&A\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nn\u2212times\n(n-fold conjunction); nA \u2261 AOAO . . .OA\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 n\u2212times (n-fold disjunction);\n(\u2203x)A \u2261 \u00ac(\u2200x)\u00acA (existential quantifier).\nThe set of all formulae of J is denoted by FJ .\nAn evaluated formula is a pair a/A, where A \u2208 FJ and a \u2208 L is its syntactic evaluation. Axioms are sets of evaluated formulae. Since the evaluations can be interpreted as membership degrees in the fuzzy set, axioms can be seen as fuzzy sets of formulae.\nA b U denotes that A is a fuzzy set on a universe U . The set of all fuzzy sets on U is denoted by F(U) = {A|A b U}. F(U) also contains all ordinary subsets of U .\nSince a fuzzy set can be considered as a function, if we have a function V : FJ \u21d2 L and a fuzzy set W b FJ , then V \u2264W means the ordering of functions.\nDefinition 1 [7] An n-ary inference rule r in FLn is of the form:\nr : a1/A1, . . . , an/An\nrevl(a1, . . . , an)/rsyn(A1, . . . , An) (1)\nwhich means from a1/A1, . . . , an/An infer r evl(a1, . . . , an)/r syn(A1, . . . , An), where r syn is a partial n-ary syntactic operation on FJ , and r evl is an n-ary lower semicontinuous evaluation operation on L (i.e., it preserves arbitrary suprema in all variables).\nA fuzzy set V b FJ is closed w.r.t. r if V (rsyn(A1, . . . , An)) \u2265 revl(V (A1), . . . , V (An)) holds for all formulae A1, . . . , An \u2208 Dom(rsyn).\nThe set R of inference rules of FLn consists of the following:\nModus ponens: rMP : a/A, b/A\u2192 B\na\u2297 b/B ; Generalization: rG :\na/A\na/(\u2200x)A\nLogical constant introduction: rLC : a/A\na\u21d2 a/a\u2192 A\nNote that the evaluation operation revlLC(x) of rLC is a\u21d2 x.\nAn proof of A \u2208 FJ from a fuzzy set X b FJ is a finite sequence of evaluated formulae w := a0/A0, a1/A1, . . . , an/An, whose each member is either a member of X, i.e., ai/Ai := X(Ai)/Ai, or follows from some preceding members of the sequence using an inference rule of FLn, and the last member is an/An := a/A. The evaluation a is called the value of the proof w, denoted V al(w). A proof w of a formula A can be denoted wA.\nA graded consequence operation is a closure operation C : F(FJ) \u21d2 F(FJ) assigning to a fuzzy set X b FJ a fuzzy set C(X) b FJ and fulfilling C(X) = C(C(X)).\nDefinition 2 [7] Let R be the set of inference rules. The fuzzy set of syntactic consequences of a fuzzy set X b FJ is the following membership function, for all A \u2208 FJ :\nCsyn(X)(A) = \u2227 {V (A)|V b FJ , X \u2264 V and V is closed w.r.t. all r \u2208 R} (2)\nTheorem 1 [7] Let X b FJ . Then, Csyn(X)(A) = \u2228 {V al(w)|w is a proof of A from X}.\nA structure for the language J of FLn is D = \u3008D, (PD)P\u2208Pred, (fD)f\u2208Func, u1, u2, . . . \u3009, where D is a non-empty domain (set); (PD) b D assigns to each n-ary predicate symbol P \u2208 Pred an n-ary fuzzy relation PD on D; (fD) assigns to each n-ary functional symbol f \u2208 Func an n-ary function fD on D; u1, u2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2208 D are designated elements which are assigned to each constant u1,u2, . . . of the language J , respectively.\nA truth valuation of formulae in a structure D is a function (also denoted by) D : FJ \u2192 L defined by means of interpretation. Let D be a structure for the language J . The language J(D) is obtained from J by adding new constants being names for all elements from D, i.e., J(D) = J \u222a {d|d \u2208 D}.\nLet A(x) be a formula and t a term. Ax[t] denotes a formula obtained from A by replacing all free occurrences of the variable x with t.\nInterpretations of closed terms and formulae are defined as follows:\n(i) Interpretation of closed terms: D(ui) = ui if ui \u2208 J and ui \u2208 D; D(d) = d if d \u2208 D; D(f(t1, . . . , tn)) = fD(D(t1), . . . ,D(tn)).\n(ii) Interpretation of closed formulae (where t1, . . . , tn are closed terms): D(a) = a for all a \u2208 L; D(P (t1, . . . , tn)) = PD(D(t1), . . . ,D(tn)); D((\u2200x)A) = \u2227 {D(Ax[d])|d \u2208 D}.\n(iii) Interpretation of the derived connectives:\nD(\u00acA) = \u00acD(A) D(A \u2227B) = D(A) \u2227 D(B) D(A&B) = D(A)\u2297D(B) D(A \u2228B) = D(A) \u2228 D(B) D(AOB) = D(A)\u2295D(B) D(A\u2194 B) = D(A)\u21d4 D(B)\nD((\u2203x)A) = \u2228 {D(Ax[d])|d \u2208 D}\nwhere \u00ac and \u2295 are Lukasiewicz negation and disjunction defined by \u00aca = 1 \u2212 a and a\u2295 b = 1 \u2227 (a+ b), respectively.\nIf A(x1, . . . , xn) is not a closed formula, an evaluation of its free variables x1, . . . , xn is first defined such that e(x1) = d1, . . . , e(xn) = dn. Then, the interpretation of A is the interpretation of Ax1,...,xn [d1, . . . ,dn], which is a closed formula.\nDefinition 3 [7] Let X b FJ be a fuzzy set of formulae. Then the fuzzy set of its semantic consequences is the following membership function:\nCsem(X)(A) = \u2227 {D(A)| for all structure D, X \u2264 D}. (3)\nA formula A is an a-tautology (tautology in the degree a) if a = Csem(\u2205)(A), and it is denoted by |=a A. If a = 1, it is simply written by |= A, and A is called a tautology.\nThe following lemma gives simple rules how to verify tautologies in FLn.\nLemma 1 [7] Let A,B be formulae in the language J .\n(a) |= A\u2192 B iff D(A) \u2264 D(B) holds for every structure D for the language J .\n(b) |= A\u2194 B iff D(A) = D(B) holds for every structure D for the language J .\nDefinition 4 [7] Let (R1) A\u2192 (B \u2192 A); (R2) (A\u2192 B)\u2192 ((B \u2192 C)\u2192 (A\u2192 C));\n(R3) (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA)\u2192 (A\u2192 B); (R4) ((A\u2192 B)\u2192 B)\u2192 ((B \u2192 A)\u2192 A);\n(B1) (a \u2192 b) \u2194 (a\u21d2 b), where (a\u21d2 b) denotes the logical constant for the value a \u21d2 b when a and b are given. This is called book-keeping axiom;\n(T1) (\u2200x)A\u2192 Ax[t] for any substitutible term t. This is called substitution axiom;\n(T2) (\u2200x)(A\u2192 B)\u2192 (A\u2192 (\u2200x)B) provided that x is not free in A.\nUsing Lemma 1, it can be verified that (R1)-(R4), (B1) and (T1)-(T2) are (1-)tautologies.\nThe fuzzy set LAx of logical axioms of FLn is as follows: LAx(F ) = 1 if F is one of the forms (R1)-(R4), (B1) and (T1)-(T2); LAx(F ) = a if F = a; and LAx(F ) = 0 otherwise.\nDefinition 5 [7] A fuzzy theory (or theory for short) T in the language J of FLn is a triple T = \u3008LAx, SAx,R\u3009, where LAx is the fuzzy set of logical axioms, SAx b FJ is a fuzzy set of special axioms, and R is the set of inference rules.\nA theory can be viewed as a fuzzy set T = Csyn(LAx \u222a SAx) b FJ .\nDefinition 6 [7] Let T be a theory and A \u2208 FJ a formula.\n(i) If Csyn(LAx\u222aSAx)(A) = a, it is denoted by T `a A, and A is said to be a theorem or provable in the degree a in T . The value a is called the provability degree of A over T .\n(ii) If Csem(LAx \u222a SAx)(A) = a, it is denoted by T a A, and A is said to be true in the degree a in T . The value a is called the truth degree of A over T .\n(iii) Let D be a truth valuation of formulae. Then, it is a model of T , denoted D T , if SAx(A) \u2264 D(A) holds for all formulae A \u2208 FJ .\nTherefore, Theorem 1 can be restated as follows: T `a A iff a = \u2228 {V al(w)|w is a proof of A from LAx \u222a SAx} (4)\nAlso, due to the assumption made on LAx, we have LAx(A) \u2264 D(A) holds for every truth valuation D of formulae. Thus,\nT a A iff a = \u2227 {D(A)|D T}. (5)\nDefinition 7 [7] A theory T is contradictory if there exists a formula A, and there are proofs wA and w\u00acA of A and \u00acA from T , respectively, such that V al(wA)\u2297V al(w\u00acA) > 0. Otherwise, it is consistent.\nTheorem 2 [7] A fuzzy theory T is consistent iff it has a model.\nTheorem 3 (Completeness) [7] T `a A iff T |=a A holds for every formula A \u2208 FJ and every consistent fuzzy theory T .\nThis means that the provability degree of A in T coincides with its truth degree over T . This is usually referred to as the Pavelka-style completeness [9, 8]."}, {"heading": "3. Fuzzy Logic in Narrow Sense with Hedges", "text": "In order to provide a foundation for a computational approach to human reasoning in the presence of vagueness, imprecision, and uncertainty, fuzzy logic should have the ability to deal with linguistic hedges, which play a very important role in the modification of fuzzy predicates. Therefore, in this section, we will extend FLn with hedges connectives in order to model human knowledge and reasoning. In addition to extending the language and the definition of formulae, new logical axioms characterizing properties of the new connectives are added. One of the most important properties should be preservation of the logical equivalence.\nDefinition 8 [7] Let : Ln \u2192 L be an n-ary operation. It is called logically fitting if it satisfies the following condition: there are natural numbers k1 > 0, . . . , kn > 0 such that\n(a1 \u21d4 b1)k1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 (an \u21d4 bn)kn \u2264 (a1, . . . , an)\u21d4 (b1, . . . , bn)\nholds for all a1, . . . , an, b1, . . . , bn \u2208 L, and the power is taken w.r.t. the operation \u2297, e.g.,\n(a1 \u21d4 b1)k1 = (a1 \u21d4 b1)\u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 (a1 \u21d4 b1)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 k1\u2212times\nHence, logically fitting operations preserve the logical equivalence. It can be proved that all the basic operations \u2228,\u2227,\u2297,\u21d2 are logically fitting, and any composite operation obtained from logically fitting operations is also logically fitting.\nA connective is logically fitting if it is assigned a logically fitting truth function (operation)."}, {"heading": "3.1. FLn with many hedges", "text": "In this subsection, FLn is extended with many hedges, in which each hedge does not have any dual one. To ease the presentation, we let s0, d0 denote the identity connective, i.e., for all formula A, A \u2261 s0A \u2261 d0A, and their truth functions s\u20220 and d\u20220 are the identity.\nDefinition 9 (FLn with many hedges) On the syntactic aspect, FLn is extended as follows (where p, q are positive integers):\n(i) The language J is extended into a language Jh by a finite set H = {s1, . . . , sp, d1, . . . , dq} of additional unary connectives, where si\u2019s are truth-stressing hedges, and dj\u2019s are truthdepressing ones.\n(ii) The definition of formulae is extended by adding the following: If A is a formula and h \u2208 H, hA is a formula.\n(iii) The fuzzy set LAx of logical axioms is extended by the following axioms:\n1/(A\u2192 B)\u2192 (hA\u2192 hB), for all h \u2208 H (6) 1/siA\u2192 si\u22121A, for i = 1, . . . , p (7)\n1/sp1 (8)\n1/dj\u22121A\u2192 djA, for j = 1, . . . , q (9) 1/\u00acdq0 (10)\nAxiom (6) states that if A implies B, then very (resp., slightly) A implies very (resp., slightly) B. Axiom (8) (resp., (10)) says that the truth function s\u2022p (resp., d \u2022 q) preserves 1 (resp., 0). Axiom (7) (resp., (9)) expresses that si (resp., dj) modifies truth more than si\u22121 (resp., dj\u22121), for i = 2, . . . , p (resp., j = 2, . . . , q). For example, slightly (resp., very) modifies truth more than rather (resp., highly) since slightly true < rather true < true (resp., true < highly true < very true). Also, for instance, let A = young(x), s1 = highly , s2 = very , d1 = rather , d2 = slightly , by (7), we have very young(x) \u2192 highly young(x) and highly young(x)\u2192 young(x). Moreover, by (9), we have young(x)\u2192 rather young(x) and rather young(x)\u2192 slightly young(x). Therefore, we have:\nvery young(x)\u2192 highly young(x)\u2192 young(x)\u2192 rather young(x)\u2192 slightly young(x)\nThis is also in accordance with fuzzy-set-based interpretations of hedges [10, 11, 12], in which very and highly are called intensifying modifiers while rather and slightly are called weakening modifiers, and they satisfy the so-called semantic entailment property:\nx is very A\u21d2 x is highly A\u21d2 x is A\u21d2 x is rather A\u21d2 x is slightly A\nwhere A is a fuzzy predicate. Note that, according to [10], if A is represented by a fuzzy set with a membership function \u00b5A(x), the membership function of very A can be \u00b5very A(x) = \u00b5 2 A(x). Since for all x, 0 \u2264 \u00b5A(x) \u2264 1, we have for all x, \u00b5very A(x) \u2264 \u00b5A(x). By fuzzy set inclusion, it is said that very A is included by A, denoted very A \u2286 A. Since the degree of membership of x to A is regarded as the truth value of \u201cx is A\u201d, the truth value of \u201cx is very A\u201d is less than or equal to that of \u201cx is A\u201d.\nTheorem 4 For every hedge connective h \u2208 H, its truth function h\u2022 is non-decreasing and preserves 0 and 1.\nProof. By (6), for all structure D of the language Jh, we have D(A\u2192 B) \u2264 D(hA\u2192 hB). Hence, D(A) \u21d2 D(B) \u2264 h\u2022(D(A)) \u21d2 h\u2022(D(B)). Let a, b \u2208 L and a \u2264 b. Since D(a) \u21d2 D(b) = a \u21d2 b = 1, we have h\u2022(D(a)) \u21d2 h\u2022(D(b)) = 1, i.e., h\u2022(a) \u2264 h\u2022(b). Therefore, the truth function h\u2022 of any hedge connective h \u2208 H is non-decreasing.\nBy (8), we have s\u2022p(1) = 1. Using (7) and taking A = 1, i = p, we have, for all structure D of the language Jh, D(sp1) \u2264 D(sp\u221211), i.e, 1 = s\u2022p(1) \u2264 s\u2022p\u22121(1). Hence, s\u2022p\u22121(1) = 1.\nSimilarly, we have s\u2022i (1) = 1 for all i = p\u22122, . . . , 1. Also, using (7) and taking A = 0, i = 1, we have, for all structure D of the language Jh, D(s10) \u2264 D(s00), i.e, s\u20221(0) \u2264 s\u20220(0) = 0. Hence, s\u20221(0) = 0. Similarly, we have s \u2022 i (0) = 0 for all i = 2, . . . , p. Therefore, all s \u2022 i preserve 0 and 1.\nBy (10), we have d\u2022q(0) = 0. Using (9) and taking A = 0, j = q, we have, for all structure D of the language Jh, D(dq\u221210) \u2264 D(dq0), i.e, d\u2022q\u22121(0) \u2264 d\u2022q(0) = 0. Hence, d\u2022q\u22121(0) = 0. Similarly, we have d\u2022j (0) = 0 for all j = q\u22122, . . . , 1. Also, using (9) and taking A = 1, j = 1, we have, for all structure D of the language Jh, D(d01) \u2264 D(d11), i.e, 1 = d\u20220(1) \u2264 d\u20221(1). Hence, d\u20221(1) = 1. Similarly, we have d \u2022 j (1) = 1 for all j = 2, . . . , q. Therefore, all d \u2022 j preserve 0 and 1.\nTheorem 5 For every truth-stresser si \u2208 H, i = 1, p, its truth function s\u2022i is subdiagonal.\nProof. For any a \u2208 L, using (7) and taking A = a, i = 1, we have, for all structure D of the language Jh, s\u20221(a) = D(s1a) \u2264 D(s0a) = s\u20220(a) = a. Thus, s\u20221(a) \u2264 a for all a \u2208 L, i.e., s\u20221 is subdiagonal. Again, using (7) and taking A = a, i = 2, we have s\u20222(a) = D(s2a) \u2264 D(s1a) = s\u20221(a) \u2264 a. Similarly, s\u2022i is subdiagonal for all i = 3, . . . , p. Theorem 6 For every truth-depresser dj \u2208 H, j = 1, q, its truth function d\u2022j is superdiagonal.\nProof. For any a \u2208 L, using (9) and taking A = a, j = 1, we have, for all structure D of the language Jh, a = d\u20220(a) = D(d0a) \u2264 D(d1a) = d\u20221(a). Thus, d\u20221(a) \u2265 a for all a \u2208 L, i.e., d\u20221 is superdiagonal. Again, using (9) and taking A = a, j = 2, we have a \u2264 d\u20221(a) = D(d1a) \u2264 D(d2a) = d\u20222(a). Similarly, d\u2022j is superdiagonal for all j = 3, . . . , q.\nThe following theorem shows that the additional hedge connectives are logically fitting.\nTheorem 7 For every hedge connective h \u2208 H, its truth function h\u2022 is logically fitting.\nProof. Given a, b \u2208 L, using (6) and taking A = a,B = b, we have, for all structure D of the language Jh, D(a \u2192 b) \u2264 D(ha \u2192 hb). Hence, a \u21d2 b \u2264 h\u2022(a) \u21d2 h\u2022(b). Again, using (6) and taking A = b, B = a, we have b \u21d2 a \u2264 h\u2022(b) \u21d2 h\u2022(a). Therefore, a\u21d4 b = (a\u21d2 b) \u2227 (a\u21d0 b) \u2264 (h\u2022(a)\u21d2 h\u2022(b)) \u2227 (h\u2022(a)\u21d0 h\u2022(b)) = h\u2022(a)\u21d4 h\u2022(b), i.e., h\u2022 is logically fitting according to Definition 8.\nWe can also say that all the hedge connectives h \u2208 H are logically fitting.\nSince it is shown in [7] that introducing logically fitting operations have no influence on the algebraic proof of the completeness theorem of FLn (Theorem 3), we have the following completeness theorem for FLn with many hedges.\nTheorem 8 Let T be a consistent fuzzy theory in the extended language Jh. Then\nT `a A iff T |=a A\nholds for every formula A \u2208 FJh.\nThat means FLn with many hedges also has the Pavelka-style completeness."}, {"heading": "3.2. FLn with many dual hedges", "text": "It can be observed that each hedge can have a dual one, e.g., slightly and rather can be seen as a dual hedge of very and highly, respectively. Thus, there might be axioms expressing dual relations of hedges in addition to axioms expressing their comparative truth modification strength.\nIn this subsection, FLn is extended with many dual hedges, in which each hedge has its own dual one.\nDefinition 10 (FLn with many dual hedges) On the syntactic aspect, FLn is extended as follows (where n is a positive integer):\n(i) The language J is extended into a language Jdh by a finite set H = {s1, . . . , sn, d1, . . . , dn} of additional unary connectives, where si\u2019s are truth-stressing hedges, and di\u2019s are truthdepressing ones.\n(ii) The definition of formulae is extended by adding the following: If A is a formula and h \u2208 H, hA is a formula.\n(iii) The fuzzy set LAx of logical axioms is extended by the following axioms:\n1/(A\u2192 B)\u2192 (hA\u2192 hB), for all h \u2208 H (11) 1/siA\u2192 si\u22121A, for i = 1, . . . , n (12)\n1/sn1 (13)\n1/di\u22121A\u2192 diA, for i = 1, . . . , n (14) 1/diA\u2192 \u00acsi\u00acA (15)\nThe main differences between the fuzzy set LAx of FLn with many dual hedges and that of FLn with many hedges are that we have the axiom (15) expressing the duality between hedges si and di, and we do not need an axiom similar to (10).\nConcerning Axiom (15), for instance, let A = young(x), si = very, di = slightly, then it means \u201cslightly young implies not very old\u201d. Using (15) and taking A = a for any a \u2208 L, we have D(dia) \u2264 D(\u00acsi\u00aca) for all structure D of the language Jdh. Thus, d\u2022i (a) \u2264 1\u2212s\u2022i (1\u2212a), then s\u2022i (1\u2212a) \u2264 1\u2212d\u2022i (a). Let b = 1\u2212a = \u00aca, hence a = 1\u2212b = \u00acb. We have s\u2022i (b) \u2264 1\u2212d\u2022i (\u00acb). Let B be a formula whose truth valuation is b, i.e., D(B) = b. We have D(siB) = s\u2022i (b) \u2264 1 \u2212 d\u2022i (\u00acb) = D(\u00acdi\u00acB). Therefore, we have a tautology 1/siB \u2192 \u00acdi\u00acB. This means, for instance, \u201cvery old implies not slightly young\u201d as well.\nSince axioms (12) and (13) are respectively similar to (7) and (8), we also have that all s\u2022i , i = 1, n, preserve 1. Using (15) and taking A = 0, we have D(di0) \u2264 D(\u00acsi\u00ac0) for all structure D of the language Jdh. Hence, d\u2022i (0) \u2264 1 \u2212 s\u2022i (1) = 0. Therefore, d\u2022i (0) = 0 for all i = 1, n. That means we do not need an axiom similar to (10).\nNow, given a hedge function s\u2022n, which is non-decreasing, subdiagonal, and preserves 0 and 1, the boundaries for the other hedge functions are one by one determined as follows. Using (12) and taking A = a for any a \u2208 L and i = n, we have s\u2022n(a) \u2264 s\u2022n\u22121(a). Thus, the lower boundary of s\u2022n\u22121(a) is s \u2022 n(a), and its upper boundary is a. Similarly, we have s\u2022n\u22121(a) \u2264 s\u2022n\u22122(a) \u2264 a, and finally, s\u20222(a) \u2264 s\u20221(a) \u2264 a. Then, by (15), we have a \u2264 d\u2022i (a) \u2264 \u00acs\u2022i (\u00aca) for all i = 1, n, thus, a and \u00acs\u20221(\u00aca) are the lower boundary and upper boundary of d\u20221(a), respectively (note that since s \u2022 1(1 \u2212 a) \u2264 1 \u2212 a, we have \u00acs\u20221(\u00aca) = 1\u2212 s\u20221(1\u2212 a) \u2265 1\u2212 (1\u2212 a) = a). Using (14) and taking A = a, i = 2, we have d\u20221(a) \u2264 d\u20222(a), thus, d\u20221(a) and \u00acs\u20222(\u00aca) are the lower boundary and upper boundary of d\u20222(a), respectively. Similarly, we have d \u2022 i\u22121(a) and \u00acs\u2022i (\u00aca) are the lower boundary and upper boundary of d\u2022i (a), respectively, for all i = 3, n. In summary, the boundaries are shown in Table 1.\nWe also have the following completeness theorem for FLn with many dual hedges.\nTheorem 9 Let T be a consistent fuzzy theory in the extended language Jdh . Then\nT `a A iff T |=a A\nholds for every formula A \u2208 FJdh.\nIt can be seen that in a case when we want to extend the above logic with one truthstressing (resp., truth-depressing) hedge without a dual one, we only need to add axioms expressing its relations to the existing truth-stressing (resp., truth-depressing) hedges according to their comparative truth modification strength."}, {"heading": "4. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we extend fuzzy logic in narrow sense with many hedge connectives in order to provide a foundation for human knowledge representation and reasoning. In fuzzy logic in narrow sense, both syntax and semantics are evaluated by degrees in [0,1]. The graded approach to syntax can be seen as an elegant and natural generalization of classical logic for inference under vagueness since it allows one to explicitly represent and reason with partial truth, i.e., proving partially true conclusions from partially true premises, and it enjoys the Pavelka-style completeness. FLn is extended in two cases: (i) each hedge does not have a dual one, and (ii) each hedge can have its own dual one. In addition to extending the language and the definition of formulae, new logical axioms characterizing properties of the hedge connectives are added. The truth function of a truth-depressing (resp., truthstressing) hedge connective is a superdiagonal (resp., subdiagonal) non-decreasing function preserving 0 and 1. The resulting logics are shown to have the Pavelka-style completeness."}, {"heading": "5. Acknowledgments", "text": "Funding from HUMG under grant number T16-02 is acknowledged."}, {"heading": "6.
