At a high level, a set of K arms is available to a player. At each turn, she has to choose one arm and receives a reward corresponding to the played arm, without knowing what would have been the received reward had she played another arm. The player faces the dilemma of exploring, that is playing an arm whose mean reward is loosely estimated in order to build a better estimate or exploiting, that is playing a seemingly best arm based on current mean estimates in order to maximize her cumulative reward. The accuracy of the player policy at time horizon T is typically measured in terms of sample complexity or of regret. The sample complexity is the number of plays required to find an approximation of the best arm with high probability.\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n02 13\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\nIn that case, the player can stop playing after identifying this arm. The regret is the difference between the cumulative rewards of the player and the one that could be acquired by a policy assumed to be optimal.\nThe stochastic multi-armed bandit problem assumes the rewards to be generated independently from stochastic distribution associated with each arm. Stochastic algorithms usually assume distributions to be constant over time like with the Thompson Sampling (TS) [13], UCB [2] or Successive Elimination (SE) [4]. Under this assumption of stationarity, TS and UCB achieve optimal upper-bounds on the cumulative regret with logarithmic dependencies on T . SE algorithm achieves near optimal sample complexity.\nIn the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem, rewards are chosen by an adversary. This formulation can model any form of non-stationarity. The EXP3 algorithm [3, 11] achieves an optimal regret ofO( \u221a T ) against an oblivious opponent that chooses rewards before the beginning of the game, with respect to the best policy that pulls the same arm over the totality of the game. This weakness is partially overcomed by EXP3.S [3], a variant of EXP3, that forgets the past adding at each time step a proportion of the mean gain and achieves controlled regret with respect to policies that allow arm switches during the run.\nThe switching bandit problem introduces non-stationarity within the stochastic bandit problem by allowing means to change at some time-steps. Discounted UCB [10] and sliding-window UCB [6] are adaptations of UCB to the switching bandit problem and achieve a regret bound of O( \u221a MT log T ), where M \u2212 1 is the number of distribution changes. EXP3.R [1] combines EXP3 with a switch detector based on Hoeffding inequality [8] in order to detect switches of best arm. This detector does not require mean rewards to be constant on the tested interval. This use of the Hoeffding inequality on nonidentical distributions is extented to SE in this paper to allow the algorithm to achieve efficient theoretical guarantees on non-stationary distributions of rewards. EXP3.R achieves a regret bound of O(N \u221a T log T ), where N \u2212 1 is the number of times when the best arm changes. As this is always smaller (and potentially much smaller) than the number of distribution changes (N \u2264M ), EXP3.R appears to be a strong competitor. It is also worth citing META-EVE [7] that associates UCB with a mean change detector, reseting the algorithm when a change is detected. While no analysis is provided, it has demonstrated strong empirical performances.\nStochastic and Adversarial. Several variants combining stochastic and adversarial rewards have been proposed by Seldin & Slivkins [12]. For instance, in the setting with contaminated rewards, rewards are mainly drawn from stationary distributions except for a minority of rewards of means chosen in advance by an adversary. In order to guarantee their proposed algorithm EXP3++ achieves logarithmic guarantees, the adversary is constrained in the sense it cannot lowered the gap between arms more than a factor 1/2. They also proposed another variant called adversarial with gap [12] which assumes the existence of a round after which an arm persists to be the best. This work is motivated by the desire to create generic algorithms able to perform bandit tasks\nwith various reward types, stationary, adversary or mainly stationary. However, despite achieving good performances on a wide range of problems, each one needs a specific parametrization (i.e. an instance of EXP3++ parametrized for stationnary rewards may not perform well if rewards are choosen by an adversary).\nOur contribution. We consider a formalization of the bandit problem where rewards are drawn from stochastic distributions of arbitrary means defined before the beginning of the game. In this non-stationary stochastic bandit context, our first contribution is to introduce and analyze a randomized version of SUCCESSIVE ELIMINATION. We show that the seemingly minor modification \u2013 a randomized round-robin procedure \u2013 leads to a dramatic improvement of the performance over the original SUCCESSIVE ELIMINATION algorithm. We show for instance in Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 that the proposed SUCCESSIVE ELIMINATION WITH RANDOMIZED ROUND-ROBIN (SER3) algorithm achieves a controlled sample complexity and cumulative regret in situations where SUCCESSIVE ELIMINATION may even suffers from a linear regret in the time horizon T , as supported by numerical experiments (see Section 5). Our second contribution is to identify a notion of gap that generalizes the gap from stochastic bandits to the non-stationary case, and derive gap-dependent (also known as problem-dependent) sample complexity and regret bounds, instead of the more classical and less informative problem-free bounds.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 3 starts with the case of non-stationary stochastic bandits when the best arm does not change during the game. We show that the sample complexity of SER3 is controlled as O( K\u22062 log K \u03b4\u2206 ) where \u2206 generalizes the usual notion of stochastic gap from the stationary case. This comes under a mild assumption (see assumption 1). In Section 4, we then extend the setting to a full-blown switching problem when the best arm is allowed to change over time. We naturally extend the definition of sample complexity to allow the optimal arm to change over time (see Definition 1), and introduce the RANDOMIZED SUCCESSIVE ELIMINATION WITH RESETS (SER4) algorithm. We show in Theorem 2 and Corollary 2 that this algorithm achieves an expected sample complexity of O( \u221a NK log(K/\u03b4)/(\u03b4\u22062)) where N \u2212 1 is the number of arm switches assumed to be known. Corollary 3 extend this result to the expected cumulative regret with an upper-bound of O(\u2206\u22121 \u221a NTK log(TK)). These results do not assume any constraint on the behavior of the stochastic distributions and provide a gap-dependent performance bound in the challenging setting of non-stationary stochastic bandits competing against switching best arms. We finally illustrate the proposed approaches on synthetic problems in Section 5."}, {"heading": "2 Setting", "text": "We consider a generalization of the adversarial setting where the adversary chooses before the beginning of the game a sequence of distributions instead of directly choosing a sequence of rewards. This generalizes the setting since choosing arbitrarily a reward yk(t) is equivalent to drawing this reward from a distribution of mean yk(t) and a variance of zero.\nThe problem. Let [K] = 1, ...,K be a set of K arms. The reward ykt(t) \u2208 [0, 1] obtained by the player after playing the arm kt is drawn from a distribution of mean \u00b5kt(t) \u2208 [0, 1]. The instantaneous gap between arms k and k\u2032 at time t is:\n\u2206k,k\u2032(t) def = \u00b5k(t)\u2212 \u00b5k\u2032(t) . (1)\nLet k\u2217(t) be the arm played by the optimal policy at time t. The notion of sample complexity. In the literature [9], the sample-complexity of an algorithm is the number of samples needed by this algorithm to find a policy achieving a specific level of performance with high probability. We denote \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 0.5] the probability of failure. For instance, for the best arm identification in the stochastic stationary bandit (that is when \u2200k\u2200t , \u00b5k(t) = \u00b5k(t + 1) and k\u2217(t) = k\u2217(t + 1)), the sample complexity is the number of sample needed to find, with a probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, an arm k\u2217 of mean reward maxk\u2208[K] \u00b5k. In section 3.1 we define the best arm in the stochastic non-stationary bandit problem without switches and in section 4 we propose a new definition of the sample complexity for the best arm identification problem with switches.\nAnalysis in sample complexity are useful for building hierarchical models of contextual bandits in a greedy way [5], reducing the exploration space.\nThe notion of regret. We define the pseudo cumulative regret as the difference of mean rewards between the arms chosen by the optimal policy and those chosen by the player:\nT\u2211\nt=1\n\u00b5k\u2217(t)(t)\u2212 \u00b5kt(t) . (2)\nUsually, in the stochastic bandit setting, the distributions of rewards are stationary and the instantaneous gap \u2206k,k\u2032(t) = \u00b5k(t)\u2212 \u00b5k\u2032(t) is the same for all the time-steps."}, {"heading": "3 Best Arm Identification in Non-stationary Stochastic Bandits.", "text": "In this section, we present the algorithm SUCCESSIVE ELIMINATION WITH RANDOMIZED ROUND-ROBIN (SER3, see algorithm 1), a randomized version of SUCCESSIVE ELIMINATION which tackles the best arm identification problem when rewards are non-stationary."}, {"heading": "3.1 A modified Successive Elimination algorithm", "text": "We elaborate on several notions required to understand the behavior of the algorithm and to relax the constrain of stationarity. The elimination mechanism The elimination mechanism was introduced by SUCCESSIVE ELIMINATION [4]. Estimators of the rewards are built by sequentially sampling the arms. After \u03c4min turns of round-robin, the elimination mechanism starts to occur. A lower-bound of the reward of the best empirical arm is computed and compared with an upper-bound of the reward of all other arms. If the lower-bound is higher than one of\nthe upper-bounds, then the associated arm is eliminated and stop being considered by the algorithm. Processes of sampling and elimination are repeated until the elimination of all arms except one.\nAlgorithm 1 SUCCESSIVE ELIMINATION WITH RANDOMIZED ROUND-ROBIN (SER3)\ninput: \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 0.5], \u2208 [0, 1), \u03c4min = log K\u03b4 output: an -approximation of the best arm S1 = [K], \u2200k, \u00b5\u0302k(0) = 0, t = 1, \u03c4 = 1 While |S\u03c4 | > 1 Shuffle S\u03c4 For each k \u2208 S\u03c4 do Play k \u00b5\u0302k(\u03c4) = \u03c4\u22121 \u03c4 \u00b5\u0302k(\u03c4 \u2212 1) + yk(t) \u03c4\nt = t+ 1 End for kmax = arg maxk\u2208S \u00b5\u0302k(\u03c4) If \u03c4 \u2265 \u03c4min Remove from S\u03c4+1 all k such as:\n\u00b5\u0302max(\u03c4)\u2212 \u00b5\u0302k(\u03c4) + \u2265 \u221a 2\n\u03c4 log\n( 4K\u03c42\n\u03b4\n)"}, {"heading": "End if", "text": "\u03c4 = \u03c4 + 1\nEnd while\nHoeffding inequality. SUCCESSIVE ELIMINATION assumes that the rewards are drawn from stochastic distributions that are identical over time (rewards are identically distributed). However, the Hoeffding inequality used by this algorithm does not require stationarity and only requires independence. We remember the Hoeffding inequality:\nLemma 1 (Hoeffding inequality [8]). If X1, X2, ..., X\u03c4 are \u03c4 independent random variables and 0 \u2264 Xi \u2264 1 for all (i = 1, 2, ..., \u03c4), then for \u03c4 > 0\nP (\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 t\u2211\ni=1\nXi \u03c4 \u2212 E\n[ t\u2211\ni=1\nXi \u03c4 ]\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2265 \u03c4 ) \u2264 2 exp ( \u22122 2\u03c4\u03c4 ) .\nThus we can use this inequality to calculate confidence bounds of empirical means computed with rewards drawn from non identical distributions.\nRandomization of the Round-Robin. We illustrate the need of randomization with an example tricking a deterministic algorithm (see figure 1).\nThe best arm seem to be k = 1 as \u00b51(t) is greater than \u00b52(t) at every time-step t. However, by sampling the arms with a deterministic policy playing sequentially k = 1 and then k = 2, after t = 6 the algorithm has only sampled rewards from a distribution of mean 0.6 for k = 1 and of mean 0.8 for k = 2. After enough time following this pattern, an elimination algorithm will eliminate the first arm. Our algorithm SER3 adds a shuffling of the arm set after each round-robin cycle to SUCCESSIVE ELIMINATION and avoids this behavior.\nUniqueness of the best arm. The best arm identification task assumes a criteria identifying the best arm without ambiguity. We define the optimal arm as:\nk\u2217 = arg max k\u2208[K]\nT\u2211\nt=1\n\u00b5k(t) . (3)\nAs an efficient algorithm will find the best arm before the end of the run, we use assumption 1 to ensure its uniqueness at every time-step. First, we define some notations. A run of SER3 is a succession of round-robin. The set [\u03c4 ] = {(t1, |S1|), ..., (t\u03c4 , |S\u03c4 |)} is a realization of SER3 and ti is the timestep when the round-robin ith of size |Si| starts (ti = 1 + \u2211i\u22121 j=1 |Sj |). As arms are only eliminated, |Si| \u2265 |Si+1|. We denote T(\u03c4) the set containing all possible realizations of \u03c4 round-robin steps. Now, we can introduce assumption 1 that ensures the best arm is the same at any time-step.\nAssumption 1 (Positive mean-gap). For any k \u2208 [K]\u2212 {k\u2217} and any [\u03c4 ] \u2208 T(\u03c4) with \u03c4 \u2265 \u03c4min, we have:\n\u2206\u2217k ([\u03c4 ]) = 1\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\u2211\ni=1\nti+|Si|\u22121\u2211\nj=ti\n\u2206k\u2217,k(j)\n|Si| > 0 . (4)\nAssumption 1 is quite weak (see e.g. figure 2(b)) and can tolerate a large noise when \u03c4 is high. As the optimal arm must distinguish itself from others, instantaneous gaps are more constrained at the beginning of the game. It is quite similar to the assumption used by Seldin & Slivkins [12] to be able to achieve logarithmic expected regret on moderately contaminated rewards, i.e., the adversary does not lower the averaged gap too much. Another analogy can be done with the adversarial with gap setting [12], \u03c4min representing the time needed for the optimal arm to accumulate enough rewards and to distinguish itself from the suboptimal arms.\nFigure 2(a) illustrates assumption 1. In this example the mean of the optimal arm k\u2217 is lower than the second one on time-steps t \u2208 {5, 6, 7}. Thus even if the instantaneous gap\nis negative during these time-steps, the mean gap \u2206\u2217k ([\u03c4 ]) stays positive. The parameter \u03c4min protects the algorithm from local noise at the initialization of the algorithm. In order to ease the reading of the results, we here assume \u03c4min = log K\u03b4 .\nAssumption 1 can be seen as a sanity-check assumption ensuring that the best-arm identification problem indeed makes sense. In section 4, we consider the more general switching bandit problem. In this case, assumption 1 may not be verified (see figure 2(b)), and is naturally extended by dividing the game in segments wherein assumption 1 is satisfied."}, {"heading": "3.2 Analysis", "text": "The sample-complexity is the number of observations needed to find an -optimal arm with high probability. All theoretical results are provided for = 0 and therefore\naccept only k\u2217 as the optimal arm. All proofs are provided in the appendix.\nTheorem 1.

(5)\nHowever, in a non-stationary environment satisfying assumption 1 SUCCESSIVE ELIMINATION will eliminate the optimal arm if the adversary knows the order of its round-robin before the beginning of the run and exploits this knowledge against the learner, thus resulting in a linear cumulative regret.\nRemark: These logarithmic guarantees result from assumption 1 that allows to stop the exploration of eliminated arms. They do not contradict the lower bound for non-stationary bandit whose scaling is in \u2126( \u221a T ) [6] as it is due to the cost of the constant exploration for the case where the best arm changes."}, {"heading": "4 Non-stationary Stochastic Multi-armed Bandit with Best Arm Switches", "text": "The switching bandit problem has been proposed by Garivier et al. [6] and assumes means to be stationary between switches. In particular, the algorithm SW-UCB is built on this assumption. The setting has been extended by Allesiardo and F\u00e9raud with EXP3.R [1] to allow mean rewards to change at every time-steps. We follow this setting and consider that a best arm switch occurs when the arm with the highest mean change.\nAlgorithm. In order to allow the algorithm to choose another arm when a switch occurs, at each turn, estimators of SER3 are reseted with a probability \u03d5 \u2208 [0, 1] and\na new task of best arm identification is started. We name this algorithm SUCCESSIVE ELIMINATION WITH RANDOMIZED ROUND-ROBIN AND RESETS (SER4).\nThe sample complexity of the best arm identification problem with switches.

The optimal policy starts playing the arm k\u2217n at the time-step Tn. Time-steps Tn when switches occur are unknown to the player.\nThe cost of switches. A cost associated to the number of iterations after a switch when the player does not know the optimal arm and does not sample is added to the usual sample complexity.\nDefinition 1. Let A be an algorithm. The sample-complexity of A performing a best arms identification task for a segmentation {Tn}n=1..N of [1 : T ], with T1 = 1 < T2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < TN < T , is \u2211N n=1 \u2211Tn+1\u22121 t=Tn\n(s(t) + 1Jkt 6=k\u2217nK), where s(t) is a binary variable equal to 1 if and only if the time-step t is used by the sampling process of A, kt is the arm identified as optimal by A at time t, k\u2217n is the optimal arm over the segment n and TN+1 = T + 1.\nPerformance analysis.

Contrarily to problem 1, mean rewards evolve slowly and SUCCESSIVE ELIMINATION (SE) achieves the same level of performance than SER3. Similarly to problem 1, UCB achieves an high cumulative regret. The cumulative regret of EXP3 is low at the end of the game but would still increase linearly with time.\nProblem 3: Decreasing means with arm switches. At every turn, the optimal arm k\u2217(t) changes with a probability of 10\u22126. In expectation, there are 10 switches by run. The mean of all suboptimal arms is \u00b5(t) = 0.95\u2212min(0.45, 10\u22127(t[mod 106]).\nOn problem 3, SER4 is challenged against SW-UCB, EXP3.S, EXP3.R and META-EVE. The probability of reset of SER4 is \u03d5 = 5\u22125. The size of the window of SW-UCB is 105. The historic considered by EXP3.R is H = 4 \u00b7 105 and the regularization parameter of EXP3.S is \u03b1 = 10\u22125.\nSER4 obtains the lowest cumulative regret, confirming the random resets approach to overcome switches of best arm. SW-UCB suffers from the same issues as UCB in previous problems and obtains a very high regret. Constant changes of mean cause META-EVE to reset very frequently and to obtain a lower regret than SW-UCB. EXP3.S and EXP3.R achieves both low regrets but EXP3.R suffers from the large size of historic needed to detect switches with a gap of \u2206. We can notice that the randomization of resets in SER4, while allowing to achieves the best performances on this problem, involve an highest variance. Indeed, on some runs, a reset may occur latelly after a best arm switch whereas the use of windows or regularization parameters will be more consistant."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We studied the benefit of random shuffling in the design of sequential elimination bandit algorithms. We showed that the use of random shuffling extends their range of application to a new class of best arm identification problems involving non-stationary distributions, without requiring new parameter, while achieving the same level of guarantees than SE with stationary distributions. We introduced SER3 and extended it to the switching bandit problem with SER4 by adding a probability of restarting the best arm identification task. Up to our knowledge, we proved the first sample complexity based upper-bound for the best arm identification problem with arm switches. The upper-bound over the cumulative regret of SER4 depends only of the number N \u2212 1 of arm switches, as opposed to the number of distribution changes M \u2212 1 in SW-UCB (M \u2265 N can be of order T in our setting)."}, {"heading": "A Technical results", "text": ""}, {"heading": "A.1 Proof of Theorem 1", "text": "The proof consists of three main steps.

Let us remind that T(\u03c4) is the set containing all possible realizations of \u03c4 sequences of round-robin. Each arm k is played one time during each round-robin phase and thus \u03c4 observations per arm are available after \u03c4 th round-robin phases.

For the best-arm identification task, we introduce a version of SUCCESSIVE ELIMINATION based on random shuffling of the K arms. We prove that under a novel and mild assumption on the mean gap \u2206, this simple but powerful modification achieves the same guarantees in term of sample complexity and cumulative regret than its original version, but in a much wider class of problems, as it is not anymore constrained to stationary distributions. We also show that the original SUCCESSIVE ELIMINATION fails to have controlled regret in this more general scenario, thus showing the benefit of shuffling. We then remove our mild assumption and adapt the algorithm to the best-arm identification task with switching arms. We adapt the definition of the sample complexity for that case and prove that, against an optimal policy with N \u22121 switches of the optimal arm, this new algorithm achieves an expected sample complexity ofO(\u2206\u22122 \u221a NK\u03b4\u22121 log(K\u03b4\u22121)), where \u03b4 is the probability of failure of the algorithm, and an expected cumulative regret of O(\u2206\u22121 \u221a NTK log(TK)) after T time steps.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
