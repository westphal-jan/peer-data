Our main goal is to investigate the similarities and differences between these two phenomena, and contrast them with native language. In particular, we are interested in the reasons for the differences between translations and originals, on one hand, and native and non-native language, on the other. Do they reflect \u201cuniversal\u201d principles, or are they dependent on the source/native language?\nMuch research in translation studies indicates that translated texts have unique characteristics. Translated texts (in any language) constitute a sublanguage of the target language, sometimes referred to as translationese (Gellerstam, 1986). The unique characteristics of translationese have been traditionally classified into two categories: properties that stem from interference of the source language (Toury, 1979), and universal traits resulting\nfrom the translation process itself, independently of the specific source and target languages (Baker, 1993; Toury, 1995). The latter so-called translation universals have triggered a continuous debate among translation studies researchers (Mauranen and Kujama\u0308ki, 2004; House, 2008; Becher, 2010).\nSimilarly, over half a century of research on second language acquisition (SLA) established the presence of cross-linguistic influences (CLI) in non-native utterances (Jarvis and Pavlenko, 2008). CLI is a cover term proposed by Kellerman and Sharwood-Smith (1986) to denote various phenomena that stem from language contact situations such as transfer, interference, avoidance, borrowing, etc.1 In addition, universal traits resulting from the learning process itself have been noticed regardless of the native language, L1.2 For example, similar developmental sequences have been observed for negation, question formation, and other sentence structures in English (Dulay and Burt, 1974; Odlin, 1989) for both Chinese and Spanish natives. Phenomena such as overgeneralization, strategies of learning (Selinker, 1972), psychological factors (Ellis, 1985), and cultural distance (Giles and Byrne, 1982) are also influential in the acquisition process.\nThere are clear similarities between translations and non-native language: both are affected by the simultaneous presence of (at least) two linguistic systems, which may result in a higher cognitive load (Shlesinger, 2003). The presence of the L1 may also cause similar CLI effects on the target language.\nOn the other hand, there are reasons to believe\n1To avoid terminological conflicts, we shall henceforth use CLI to denote any influence of one linguistic system over another, w.r.t. both translations and non-native productions.\n2For simplicity, we will use L1 to refer both to the native language of a speaker and to the source language of a translated text. We use target language to refer to second and translation languages (English in this paper).\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n03 20\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n1 Se\np 20\n16\nthat translationese and non-native language should differ from each other. Translations are produced by native speakers of the target language. Nonnatives, in contrast, arguably never attain nativelike abilities (Coppieters, 1987; Johnson and Newport, 1991), however this hypothesis is strongly debated in the SLA community (Birdsong, 1992; Lardiere, 2006).\nOur goal in this work is to investigate three language varieties: the language of native speakers (N), the language of advanced, highly fluent nonnative speakers (NN), and translationese (T). We use the term constrained language to refer to the latter two varieties. We propose a unified computational umbrella for exploring two related areas of research on bilingualism: translation studies and second language acquisition. Specifically, we put forward three main hypotheses: (1) The three language varieties have unique characteristics that make them easily distinguishable. (2) Non-native language and translations are closer to each other than either of them is to native language. (3) Some of these characteristics are dependent on the specific L1, but many are not, and may reflect unified principles that similarly affect translations and non-native language.\nWe test these hypotheses using several corpusbased computational methods. We use supervised and unsupervised classification (Section 4) to show that the three language varieties are easily distinguishable. In particular, we show that native and advanced non-native productions can be accurately separated. More pertinently, we demonstrate that non-native utterances and translations comprise two distinct linguistic systems.\nIn Section 5, we use statistical analysis to explore the unique properties of each language variety. We show that the two varieties of constrained language are much closer to each other than they are to native language: they exhibit poorer lexical richness, a tendency to use more frequent words, a different distribution of idiomatic expressions and pronouns, and excessive use of cohesive devices. This is an unexpected finding, given that both natives and translators (in contrast to non-natives) produce texts in their mother tongue.\nFinally, in Section 6 we use language modeling to show that translations and non-native language exhibit similar statistical properties that clearly reflect cross-linguistic influences: experiments with distinct language families reveal salient ties be-\ntween the two varieties of constrained language. The main contribution of this work is thus theoretical: it sheds light on some fundamental questions regarding bilingualism, and we expect it to motivate and drive future research in both SLA and translation studies. Moreover, a better understanding of constrained language may also have some practical import, as we briefly mention in the following section."}, {"heading": "2 Related work", "text": "Corpus-based investigation of translationese has been a prolific field of recent research, laying out an empirical foundation for the theoretically motivated hypotheses on the characteristics of translationese. More specifically, identification of translated texts by means of automatic classification shed light on the manifestation of translation universals and cross-linguistic influences as markers of translated texts (Baroni and Bernardini, 2006; van Halteren, 2008; Gaspari and Bernardini, 2008; Kurokawa et al., 2009; Koppel and Ordan, 2011; Ilisei and Inkpen, 2011; Volansky et al., 2015; Rabinovich and Wintner, 2015; Nisioi, 2015b), while Gaspari and Bernardini (2008) introduced a dataset for investigation of potential common traits between translations and non-native texts. Such studies prove to be important for the development of parallel corpora (Resnik and Smith, 2003), the improvement in quality of plagiarism detection (Potthast et al., 2011), language modeling, and statistical machine translation (Lembersky et al., 2012, 2013).\nComputational approaches also proved beneficial for theoretical research in second language acquisition (Jarvis and Pavlenko, 2008). Numerous studies address linguistic processes attributed to SLA, including automatic detection of highly competent non-native writers (Tomokiyo and Jones, 2001; Bergsma et al., 2012), identification of the mother tongue of English learners (Koppel et al., 2005; Tetreault et al., 2013; Tsvetkov et al., 2013; Nisioi, 2015a) and typology-driven error prediction in learners\u2019 speech (Berzak et al., 2015). These studies are instrumental for language teaching and student evaluation (Smith and Swan, 2001), and can improve NLP applications such as authorship profiling (Estival et al., 2007) or grammatical error correction (Chodorow et al., 2010). Most of these studies utilize techniques that are motivated by the same abstract principles associ-\nated with L1 influences on the target language. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to address both translations and non-native language under a unifying computational framework, and in particular to compare both with native language."}, {"heading": "3 Methodology and experimental setup", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Dataset", "text": "Our dataset3 is based on the highly homogeneous corpus of the European Parliament Proceedings (Koehn, 2005). Note that the proceedings are produced as follows: (1) the utterances of the speakers are transcribed; (2) the transcriptions are sent to the speaker who may suggest minimal editing without changing the content; (3) the edited version is then translated by native speakers. Note in particular that the texts are not a product of simultaneous interpretation.\nIn this work we utilize a subset of Europarl in which each sentence is manually annotated with speaker information, including the EU state represented and the original language in which the sentence was uttered (Nisioi et al., 2016). The texts in the corpus are uniform in terms of style, respecting the European Parliament\u2019s formal standards. Translations are produced by native English speakers and all non-native utterances are selected from members not representing UK or Ireland. Europarl N consists of texts delivered by native speakers from England.\nTable 1 depicts statistics of the dataset.4 In contrast to other learner corpora such as ICLE (Granger, 2003), EFCAMDAT (Geertzen et al., 2013) or TOEFL-11 (Blanchard et al., 2013), this corpus contains translations, native, and nonnative English of high proficiency speakers. Members of the European Parliament have the right to use any of the EU\u2019s 24 official languages when speaking in Parliament, and the fact that some of them prefer to use English suggests a high degree of confidence in their language skills."}, {"heading": "3.2 Preprocessing", "text": "All datasets were split by sentence, cleaned (text lowercased, punctuation and empty lines removed) and tokenized using the Stanford tools\n3The dataset is available at http://nlp.unibuc. ro/resources.html\n4Appendix A provides details on the distribution of NN and T texts by various L1s.\n(Manning et al., 2014). For the classification experiments we randomly shuffled the sentences within each language variety to prevent interference of other artifacts (e.g., authorship, topic) into the classification procedure. We divided the data into chunks of approximately 2,000 tokens, respecting sentence boundaries, and normalized the values of lexical features by the number of tokens in each chunk. For classification we used Platt\u2019s sequential minimal optimization algorithm (Keerthi et al., 2001; Hall et al., 2009) to train support vector machine classifiers with the default linear kernel.\nIn all the experiments we used (the maximal) equal amount of data from each category, thus we always randomly down-sampled the datasets in order to have a comparable number of examples in each class; specifically, 354 chunks were used for each language variety: N, NN and T."}, {"heading": "3.3 Features", "text": "The first feature set we utilized for the classification tasks comprises function words (FW), probably the most popular choice ever since Mosteller and Wallace (1963) used it successfully for the Federalist Papers. Function words proved to be suitable features for multiple reasons:(1) they abstract away from contents and are therefore less biased by topic; (2) their frequency is so high that by and large they are assumed to be selected unconsciously by authors; (3) although not easily interpretable, they are assumed to reflect grammar, and therefore facilitate the study of how structures are carried over from one language to another. We used the list of approximately 400 function words provided in Koppel and Ordan (2011).\nA more informative way to capture (admittedly shallow) syntax is to use part-of-speech (POS) trigrams. Triplets such as PP (personal pronoun) + VHZ (have, 3sg present) + VBN (be, past participle) reflect a complex tense form, represented distinctively across languages. In Europarl, for example, this triplet is highly frequent in translations\nfrom Finnish and Danish and much rarer in translations from Portuguese and Greek. In this work we used the top-3,000 most frequent POS trigrams in each corpus.\nWe also used positional token frequency (Grieve, 2007). The feature is defined as counts of words occupying the first, second, third, penultimate and last positions in a sentence. The motivation behind this feature is that sentences open and close differently across languages, and it should be expected that these opening and closing devices will be transferred from L1 if they do not violate the grammaticality of the target language. Positional tokens were previously used for translationese identification (Volansky et al., 2015) and for native language detection (Nisioi, 2015a).\nTranslations are assumed to exhibit explicitation: the tendency to render implicit utterances in the source text more explicit in the translation product. For example, causality, even though not always explicitly expressed in the source, is expressed in the target by the introduction of cohesive markers such as because, due to, etc. (BlumKulka, 1986). Similarly, Hinkel (2001) conducted a comparative analysis of explicit cohesive devices in academic texts by non-native English students, and found that cohesive markers are distributed differently in non-native English productions, compared to their native counterparts. To study this phenomenon, we used the set of over 100 cohesive markers introduced in Hinkel (2001)."}, {"heading": "4 The status of constrained language", "text": "To establish the unique nature of each language variety in our dataset, we perform multiple pairwise binary classifications between N, NN, and T, as well as three-way classifications. Table 2 reports the results; the figures reflect average tenfold cross-validation accuracy (the best result in each column is boldfaced).\nIn line with previous works (see Section 2), classification of N\u2013T, as well as N\u2013NN, yields excellent results with most features and feature combinations. NN\u2013T appears to be easily distinguishable as well; specifically, FW+POS-trigrams combination with/without positional tokens yields 99.57% accuracy. The word maybe is among the most discriminative feature for NN vs. T, being overused in NN, as opposed to perhaps, which exhibits a much higher frequency in T; this may indicate a certain degree of formality, typical of trans-\nlated texts (Olohan, 2003). The words or, which and too are considerably more frequent in T, implying higher sentence complexity. This trait is also reflected by shorter NN sentences, compared to T: the average sentence length in Europarl is 26 tokens for NN vs. 30 for T. Certain decisiveness devices (sure, very) are underused in T, in accordance with Toury (1995)\u2019s law of standardization (Vanderauwera, 1985). The three-way classification yields excellent results as well; the highest accuracy is obtained using FW+positional tokens with/without POS-trigrams.\nA careful inspection of the results in Table 2 reveals that NN\u2013T classification is a slightly yet systematically harder task than N\u2013T or N\u2013NN; this implies that NN and T texts are more similar to each other than either of them is to N.\nTo emphasize this last point, we analyze the separability of the three language varieties by applying unsupervised classification. We perform bisecting KMeans clustering procedure previously used for unsupervised identification of translationese by Rabinovich and Wintner (2015). Clustering of N, NN and T using function words into three clusters yields high accuracy, above 90%. For the sake of clusters\u2019 visualization in a bidimensional plane, we applied principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction.\nThe results are depicted in Figure 1 (a). Evidently, NN and T exhibit higher mutual proximity than either of them with N. Fixing the number of expected clusters to 2 further highlights this observation, as demonstrated in Figure 1 (b): both NN and T instances were assigned to a single cluster, distinctively separable from the N cluster.\nWe conclude that the three language varieties (N, NN, and T) constitute three different, distinguishable ontological categories, characterized by various lexical, syntactic and grammatical properties; in particular, the two varieties of constrained language (NN and T) represent two distinct linguistic systems. Nevertheless, we anticipate NN and T to share more common tendencies and regularities, when compared to N. In the following sections, we put this hypothesis to the test."}, {"heading": "5 L1-independent similarities", "text": "In this section we address L1-independent similarities between NN and T, distinguishing them from N. We focus on characteristics which are theoretically motivated by translation studies and which are considered to be L1-independent, i.e., unrelated to cross-linguistic influences. We hypothesize that linguistic devices over- or underrepresented in translation would behave similarly in highly competent non-native productions, compared to native texts.\nTo test this hypothesis, we realized various linguistic phenomena as properties that can be easily computed from N, NN and T texts. We refer to the computed characteristics as metrics. Our hypothesis is that NN metric values will be similar to T, and that both will differ from N. We used equallysized texts of 780K tokens for N, NN and T; the exact computation is specified for each metric.\nFor the sake of visualization, the three values of each metric (for N, NN and T) were zeroone scaled by total-sum normalization. Figure 2 graphically depicts the normalized metric values. We now describe and motivate each metric. We analyze the results in Section 5.1 and establish their statistical significance in Section 5.2.\nLexical richness Translated texts tend to exhibit less lexical diversity (Al-Shabab, 1996). BlumKulka (1986) suggested that translated texts make do with less words, which is reflected by their lower type-to-token ratio (TTR) compared to that of native productions. We computed the TTR metric by dividing the number of unique (lemmatized)\ntokens by the total number of tokens.\nMean word rank Halverson (2003) claims that translators use more prototypical language, i.e., they regress to the mean (Shlesinger, 1989). We, therefore, hypothesize that rarer words are used more often in native texts than in non-native productions and translationese. To compute this metric we used a BNC-based ranked list of 50K English words5, excluding the list of function words (see Section 3.3). The metric value was calculated by averaging the rank of all tokens in a text; tokens that do not appear in the list of 50K were excluded.\nCollocations Collocations are distributed differently in translations and in originals (Toury, 1980; Kenny, 2001). Common and frequent collocations are used almost subconsciously by native speakers, but will be subjected to a more careful choice by translators and, presumably, by fluent non-native speakers (Erman et al., 2014). For example, the phrase make sure appears twice more often in native Europarl texts than in NN, and five times more than in T; bear in mind has almost double frequency in N, compared to NN and T. Expressions such as: bring forward, figure out, in light of, food chain and red tape appear dozens of times in N, as opposed to zero occurrences in NN and T Europarl texts. This metric is defined by computing the frequency of idiomatic expressions6 in terms of types.\nCohesive markers Translations were proven to employ cohesion intensively (Blum-Kulka, 1986; \u00d8vera\u030as, 1998; Koppel and Ordan, 2011). Nonnative texts tend to use cohesive markers differently as well: sentence transitions, the major cohesion category, was shown to be overused by nonnative speakers regardless of their native language (Hinkel, 2001). The metric is defined as the frequency of sentence transitions in the three language varieties.\nQualitative comparison of various markers between NN and T productions, compared to N in the Europarl texts, highlights this phenomenon: in addition is twice as frequent in NN and T than in N; according, at the same time and thus occur three times more frequently in NN and T, compared to N; moreover is used four times more fre-\n5https://www.kilgarriff.co.uk we used the list extracted from both spoken and written text.\n6Idioms were taken from https://en. wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_ idioms. The list was minimally cleaned up.\nquently; and to conclude is almost six times more frequent.\nPersonal pronouns We expect both non-native speakers and translators to spell out entities (both nouns and proper nouns) more frequently, as a means of explicitation (Olohan, 2002), thus leading to under-use of personal pronouns, in contrast to native texts. As an example, his and she are twice more frequent in N than in NN and T.\nWe define this metric as the frequency of (all) personal and possessive pronouns used in the three language varieties. The over-use of personal pronouns in N utterances, is indeed balanced out by lower frequency of proper and regular nouns in these texts, compared to T and NN.7"}, {"heading": "5.1 Analysis", "text": "Evidently (see Figure 2), translationese and nonnative productions exhibit a consistent pattern in both datasets, compared to native texts: NN and T systematically demonstrate lower metric values than N for all characteristics (except sentence transitions, where both NN and T expectedly share a higher value). All metrics except mean word rank exhibit substantial (sometimes dramatic) differences between N, on the one hand, and NN and T, on the other, thus corroborating our hypothesis. Mean word rank exhibits a more moderate variability in the three language varieties, yielding near identical value in NN and T; yet, it shows excessive usage in N.\nThe differences between metric values are statistically significant for all metrics (Section 5.2).\n7Normalized frequencies of nouns and proper nouns are 0.323, 0.331 and 0.345 for N, T, and NN, respectively.\nMoreover, in all cases (except transitions), the difference between NN and T metrics is significantly lower than the difference between either of them and N, implying a higher proximity of NN and T distributions, compared individually to N. This finding further emphasizes the common tendencies between NN and T.\nAs shown in Figure 2, NN and T are systematically and significantly different from N. Additionally, we can see that T is consistently positioned between N and NN (except for sentence transitions), implying that translations produced by native speakers tend to resemble native utterances to a higher degree than non-native productions."}, {"heading": "5.2 Statistical significance", "text": "Inspired by the results depicted in Figure 2, we now put to test two statistical hypotheses: (1) N, NN and T productions do not represent identical underlying distributions, i.e., at least one pair is distributed differently; and consequently, (2) NN and T productions exhibit higher similarity (in terms of distance) than either of them with N. We test these hypotheses by applying the bootstrapping statistical analysis.\nBootstrapping is a statistical technique involving random re-sampling (with replacement) from the original sample; it is often used to assign a measure of accuracy (e.g., a confidence interval) to an estimate. Specifically, let CN, CNN and CT denote native, non-native and translated sub-corpora of equal size (780K tokens). Let CALL denote the concatenation of all three sub-corpora, resulting in a total of 2,340M tokens. We further denote a function computing a metric m by fm; when applied to C, its value is fm(C). The sum of pair-\nwise distances between the three individual dataset metrics is denoted by Dtotal:\nDtotal = |fm(CN)\u2212 fm(CNN)|+ |fm(CN)\u2212 fm(CT)|+ |fm(CNN)\u2212 fm(CT)|\nHigh values of Dtotal indicate a difference between the three language varieties. To examine whether the observed Dtotal is high beyond chance level, we use the bootstrap approach, and repeat the following process 1,000 times:8 we sample CALL with replacement (at sentence granularity), generating in the j-th iteration equal-sized samples C\u0302N j , C\u0302NN j , C\u0302T j . The corresponding distance estimate, therefore, is:\nD\u0302total j = |fm(C\u0302N j )\u2212 fm(C\u0302NN j )|+\n|fm(C\u0302N j )\u2212 fm(C\u0302T j )|+ |fm(C\u0302NN j )\u2212 fm(C\u0302T j )|\nWe repeat random re-sampling and computation\nof D\u0302total j\n1,000 times, and estimate the p-value of D\u0302total by calculation of its percentile within the series of (sorted) D\u0302total j\nvalues, where j \u2208 (1, . . . , 1000). In all our experiments the original distance Dtotal exceeds the maximum estimate in the series of D\u0302total j , implying highly significant difference, with p-value<0.001 for all metrics. In order to stress this outcome even further, we now test whether (the constrained) NN and T exhibit higher pairwise similarity, as opposed to N. We achieve this by assessment of the distance between NN and T productions, compared to the distance between N and its closest production (again, in terms of distance): either NN or T. We sample CN, CNN and CT (with replacement) separately, constructing C\u0303N, C\u0303NN and C\u0303T, respectively, and define the following distance function:\nD\u0303dif j = |fm(C\u0303N j )\u2212fm(C\u0303jK)|\u2212|f m(C\u0303NN j )\u2212fm(C\u0303T j )|\nwhere\nK=  NN if |fm(CN)\u2212 fm(CNN)| <\n|fm(CN)\u2212 fm(CT)| T otherwise\nWe repeat re-sampling and computation of D\u0303dif j 1,000 times for each metric value in both\n8This sample size is proven sufficient by the highly significant results (very low p-value).\ndatasets and sort the results. The end points of the 95% confidence interval are defined by estimate values with 2.5% deviation from the minimum (min-end-point) and the maximum (maxend-point) estimates. We assess the p-value of the test by inspecting the estimate underlying the minend-point; specifically, in case the min-end-point is greater than 0, we consider p<0.05. Metric categories exhibiting higher NN-T similarity than either N-NN or N-T are marked with \u201c*\u201d in Figure 2."}, {"heading": "6 L1-related similarities", "text": "We hypothesize that both varieties of constrained language exhibit similar (lexical, grammatical, and structural) patterns due to the influence of L1 over the target language. Consequently, we anticipate that non-native productions of speakers of a certain native language (L1) will be closer to translations from L1 than to translations from other languages.\nLimited by the amount of text available for each individual language, we set out to test this hypothesis by inspection of two language families, Germanic and Romance. Specifically, the Germanic family consists of NN texts delivered by speakers from Austria, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden; and the Romance family includes NN speakers from Portugal, Italy, Spain, France and Romania. The respective T families comprise translations from Germanic and Romance originals, corresponding to the same countries. Table 3 provides details on the datasets.\nWe estimate L1-related traces in the two varieties of constrained language by the fitness of a translationese-based language model (LM) to utterances of non-native speakers from the same language family. Attempting to trace structural and grammatical, rather than content similarities, we compile five-gram POS language models from Germanic and Romance translationese (GerT and RomT, respectively).9 We examine the predic-\n9For building LMs we used the closed vocabulary of Penn\ntion power of these models on non-native productions of speakers with Germanic and Romance native languages (GerNN and RomNN), hypothesizing that an LM compiled from Germanic translationese will better predict non-native productions of a Germanic speaker and vice versa. The fitness of a language model to a set of sentences is estimated in terms of perplexity (Jelinek et al., 1977).\nFor building and estimating language models we used the KenLM toolkit (Heafield, 2011), employing modified Kneser-Ney smoothing without pruning. Compilation of language-family-specific models was done using 7M tokens of Germanic and Romance translationese each; the test data consisted of 5350 sentences of Germanic and Romance non-native productions. Consequently, for perplexity experiments with individual languages we utilized 500 sentences from each language. We excluded OOVs from all perplexity computations.\nTable 4 reports the results. Prediction of GerNN by the GerT language model yields a slightly lower perplexity (i.e., a better prediction) than prediction by RomT. Similarly, RomNN is much better predicted by RomT than by GerT. These differences are statistically significant: we divided the NN texts into 50 chunks of 100 sentences each, and computed perplexity values by the two LMs for each chunk. Significance was then computed by a two-tailed paired t-test, yielding p-values of 0.015 for GerNN and 6e-22 for RomNN.\nAs a further corroboration of the above result, we computed the perplexity of the GerT and RomT language models with respect to the language of NN speakers, this time distinguishing speakers by their country of origin. We used the same language models and non-native test chunks of 500 sentences each. Inspired by the outcome of the previous experiment, we expect that NN productions by Germanic speakers will be better predicted by GerT LM, and vice versa. Figure 3 presents a scatter plot with the results.\nA clear pattern, evident from the plot, reveals\nTreebank POS tag set.\nthat all English texts with underlying Romance native languages (under the diagonal) are better predicted (i.e., obtain lower perplexity) by the RomT LM. All Germanic native languages (except German), on the other hand, are better predicted by the GerT LM. This finding further supports the hypothesis that non-native productions and translationese tend to exhibit similar L1-related traits."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "We presented a unified computational approach for studying constrained language, where many of the features were theoretically motivated. We demonstrated that while translations and nonnative productions are two distinct language varieties, they share similarities that stem from lower lexical richness, more careful choice of idiomatic expressions and pronouns, and (presumably) subconscious excessive usage of explicitation cohesive devices. More dramatically, the language modeling experiments reveal salient ties between the native language of non-native speakers and the source language of translationese, highlighting the unified L1-related traces of L1 in both scenarios. Our findings are intriguing: native speakers and translators, in contrast to non-native speakers, use their native language, yet translation seems to gravitate towards non-native language use.\nThe main contribution of this work is empirical, establishing the connection between these types of language production. While we believe that these common tendencies are not incidental, more research is needed in order to establish a theoretical\nexplanation for the empirical findings, presumably (at least partially) on the basis of the cognitive load resulting from the simultaneous presence of two linguistic systems.
