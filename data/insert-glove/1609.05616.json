Fuzzy set theory is a formalism for representation of imprecise, linguistic information. A vague concept is described by a membership function, attributing to all members of a given universe X a degree of membership from the interval [0,1]. The graded membership value refers to many-valued propositions in presence of complete information. But this \u2019one-dimensional\u2019 measurement cannot capture the uncertainty present\nin information. In absence of complete information the membership degree may not be assigned precisely. This uncertainty with respect to the assignment of membership degrees is captured by assigning a range of possible membership values, hence by assigning an interval. Interval-valued Fuzzy Sets (IVFSs) deal with vagueness and uncertainty simultaneously by replacing the crisp [0,1]-valued membership degree by intervals in [0,1]. The intuition is that the actual membership would be a value within this interval. The intervals can be ordered with respect to their degree of truth as well as with respect to their degree of certainty by means of a bilattice-based algebraic structure, namely Triangle (Arieli, Cornelis, Deschrijver, & Kerre, 2004, 2005; Cornelis, Arieli, Deschrijver, & Kerre, 2007). This algebraic structure serves as an elegant framework for reasoning with uncertain and imprecise information.\nThe truth and knowledge ordering of intervals as induced by the bilatticebased triangle are inadequate for capturing the repetitive revision and modification of belief in nonmonotonic reasoning and are not always intuitive. In this paper we address this issue and attempt to propose an alternate algebraic structure to eliminate the shortcomings of bilattice-based triangle. The major contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\u2022 We demonstrate, with the help of proper examples (in section 3), that bilattice-based triangle is incapable of handling belief revision associated with nonmonotonic reasoning. In nonmonotonic reasoning, inferences are modified as more and more information is gathered. The prototypical example is inferring a particular individual can fly from the fact that it is a bird, but retracting that inference when an additional fact is added, that the individual is a penguin. Such continuous belief revision is not properly represented in bilattice-based triangle.\n\u2022 We point that the truth ordering is unintuitive regarding the ordering of intervals when one interval lies completely within the other (section 3).\n\u2022 Exploiting the discrepancies mentioned, we propose modifications for knowledge ordering and truth ordering of intervals so that the aforementioned shortcomings are removed (in section 4).\n\u2022 Using the modified knowledge and truth ordering we construct an alternate algebraic structure, namely preorder-based triangle (in section 5). This structure can be thought of as a unification of bilattice-based triangle and default bilattice (Ginsberg, 1988). With this we come out of the realm of bilattice-based structures and explore a new algebraic structure based on simple linear pre-ordering.\n\u2022 The proposed algebraic structure is then equipped with appropriate logical operators, i.e. negation, t-norms, t-conorms, implicators, in section\n6. Most of the operators are in unison with those used for the bilattice-based structure. But the modified orderings offer additional flexibility."}, {"heading": "2 Intervals as degree of belief:", "text": "This section addresses some of the basic definitions and notions that will ease the discussion in the forthcoming sections.\nUncertainty and incompleteness of information is unavoidable in real life reasoning. Hence, sometimes it becomes difficult and misleading, if not impossible, to assign a precise degree of membership to some fuzzy attribute or to assert a precise degree of truth to a proposition. Therefore, assigning an interval of possible truth values is the natural solution. Intervals are appropriate to describe experts\u2019 degrees of belief, which may not be precise (Nguyen, Kreinovich, & Zuo, 1997). If an expert chooses a value, say 0.8, as his degree of belief for a proposition, actually we can only specify vaguely that his chosen value is around 0.8 and can be represented by an interval, say [0.75, 0.85]. Otherwise an interval can be thought of as a collection of possible truth values that a single or multiple rational experts would assign to a proposition in a scenario. Due to lack of complete knowledge the assertions made by different experts will be different and this lack of unanimity can be reflected by appropriate interval. The natural ordering of degree of memberships (\u2264) can be extended to the set of intervals and that gives rise to IVFS (Sambuc, 1975).\nAn IVFS can be viewed as an L-fuzzy set (Goguen, 1967) and the corresponding lattice can be defined as (Deschrijver, Arieli, Cornelis, & Kerre, 2007):\nDefinition 2.1. LI = (LI ,\u2264L), where L I = {[x1, x2]|(x1, x2) \u2208 [0, 1]\u00d7[0, 1] and x1 \u2264 x2} and [x1, x2] \u2264L [y1, y2] iff x1 \u2264 y1 and x2 \u2264 y2.\nIn the definition, LI is the set of all closed subintervals in [0,1].Figure 1 shows the set LI ."}, {"heading": "2.1 Bilattice-based Triangle:", "text": "Bilattices are ordered sets where elements are partially ordered with respect to two orderings, typically one depicts the degree of vagueness or truth (namely, truth ordering) and the other one depicting the degree of certainty (namely, knowledge ordering) (Arieli et al., 2004; Cornelis et al., 2007). A bilattice-based triangle, or simply Triangle, can be defined as follows:\nDefinition 2.2. Let L = (L,\u2264L) be a complete lattice and let I(L) = {[x1, x2] | (x1, x2) \u2208 L\n2 and x1 \u2264L x2}. A (bilattice-based) triangle is defined as a structure B(L) = (I(L),\u2264t,\u2264k), where, for every [x1, x2], [y1, y2] in I(L):\n1. [x1, x2] \u2264t [y1, y2] \u21d4 x1 \u2264L y1 and x2 \u2264L y2. 2. [x1, x2] \u2264k [y1, y2] \u21d4 x1 \u2264L y1 and x2 \u2265L y2.\nThis triangle B(L) is not a bilattice, since, though the substructure (I(L),\u2264t) is a complete lattice but (I(L),\u2264k) is a complete semilattice.\nWhen L is the unit interval [0,1], then I(L) describes membership of IVFS, LI , and the lattice LI becomes (I(L),\u2264t). In knowledge ordering, the intervals are ordered by set inclusion, as was suggested by Sandewall (Sandewall, 1989). The knowledge inherent in an interval [c, d] is greater than another interval [a, b] if [c, d] \u2286 [a, b].\nTriangle B({0, 0.5, 1}) is shown in Figure 2."}, {"heading": "3 Inadequacy of Bilattice-based Triangle:", "text": "Intervals are used to approximate degree of truth of propositions in absence of complete knowledge. All values within an interval are considered to be equally probable to be the actual truth value of the underlying proposition. Thus considering intervals as truth status or epistemic state of propositions enables efficient representation of vagueness and uncertainty of information and reasoning. However, the Triangle structure suffers from the following shortcomings which must be eliminated."}, {"heading": "3.1 Inadequacy in modeling belief revision in nonmonotonic reasoning:", "text": "One important aspect of human commonsense reasoning is that it is nonmonotonic in nature (Brewka, 1991). In many cases conclusions are drawn in absence of complete information and we have to draw plausible conclusions based on the assumption that the world in which the reasoning is performed is normal and as expected. This is the best that can be done in contexts where the acquired knowledge is incomplete. But, these conclusions may have to be given up in light of further information. A proposition that was assumed to be true, may turn out to be false when new information is gathered. Such repetitive alterations of believes is an essential part of nonmonotonic reasoning. This type of belief revision may not be adequately represented by Triangle. The following discussion will illuminate this issue."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 An intuitive explanation:", "text": "Suppose the following information is given:\nRules: Bird(x) \u2212\u2192 Fly(x), [Birds Fly] Penguin(x) \u2212\u2192 \u00acFly(x), [Penguin doesn\u2019t Fly]\nFacts: Bird (Tweety) [Tweety is a bird] Given this information, suppose, multiple experts are trying to assess the\ndegree of truth of the proposition \u201dTweety Flies\u201d [Fly (Tweety)]. The rule \u201dBirds Fly\u201d is not a universally true fact, rather it\u2019s a general assumption that has several exceptions. Thus, being a Bird is not sufficient to infer that it will fly, since it may be a Penguin, an ostrich or some other non-flying bird. Since, nothing is specified about Tweety except for it is a bird, it is natural in human commonsense reasoning to \u201dassume\u201d that Tweety is not an exception and it will fly. Now, the confidence about this \u201dasumption\u201d will be different for different experts. An expert may bestow his complete faith on the fact that Tweety is not an exceptional bird and he will assign truth value 1 to \u201dTweety flies\u201d. Another expert may remain indecisive as he cannot ignore the chances that Tweety may be a non-flying bird and he will assign 0.5 (neither true nor false) to the proposition \u201dTweety flies\u201d. Others\u2019 assignments may be at some intermediate level depending on their perception about the world. Thus, the experts\u2019 truth assignments collectively construct an interval [0.5, 1] as the epistemic state of the rule \u201dBirds fly\u201d as well as of the fact \u201d Fly(Tweety)\u201d.\nNow, suppose an additional information is acquired that:\nPenguin(Tweety). [Tweety is a penguin]\nThen all the experts will unanimously declare Tweety doesn\u2019t fly and assign an interval [0, 0] as the revised epistemic state of the proposition \u201dTweety flies\u201d. The epistemic state of the proposition \u201d Tweety flies\u201d was first asserted by an interval [0.5, 1] and later the experts retracted their previously drawn decision to assert another interval [0, 0]. From intuition it can be claimed that the interval [0, 0] makes a more confident and precise assertion than [0.5, 1], since in the former case all the experts were unanimous. But this is not reflected in the bilattice-based triangle (Figure 2); since in Triangle [0.5, 1] and [0, 0] are incomparable in knowledge ordering. Thus, given the two intervals, based on the triangle structure, we remain clueless about which interval has higher degree of knowledge and which interval we should take up as final assertion of \u201d Tweety flies\u201d. This is counter-intuitive and unwanted.\nThis type of scenario can be efficiently taken care of in the default bilattice (Ginsberg, 1988). The general rule \u201dBirds fly\u201d will be assigned \u2019dt\u2019, i.e. true by default. Hence, \u2019Tweety flies\u2019 will also get dt. After acquiring the knowledge that Tweety is a penguin, \u2019Tweety flies\u2019 is asserted definitely false, i.e. f. In the default bilattice (Figure 3.a) f \u2265k dt, expressing that the later conclusion is more certain than the earlier one.\nThe aforementioned example demonstrates that Triangle is incapable of\ndepicting the continuous revision of decisions in absence of complete knowledge. Default bilattice is more appropriate than Triangle with respect to belief revision in nonmonotonic reasoning, but, vagueness or imprecision of information cannot be represented in Default bilattice."}, {"heading": "3.1.2 Inadequacy of bilattice-based triangle in performing logical reasoning in application areas:", "text": "Bilattice-based structures are put to use for logical reasoning involving human detection and identity maintenance in visual surveillance systems by Shet et al. (Shet, 2007; Shet, Neumann, Ramesh, & Davis, 2007; Shet, Harwood, & Davis, 2006a).\nMulti-valued default bilattice (also known as prioritized default bilattice (Figure 3.b) has been used for identity maintenance and contextual reasoning in visual surveillance system (Shet et al., 2006a). However in practice, logical facts are generated from vision analytics, which rely upon machine learning and pattern recognition techniques and in general have noisy values. Thus, in practical applications it would be more realistic to attach arbitrary amount of beliefs to logical rules rather than values such as dt, df etc that are allowed in multivalued default bilattices. For instance, similarity of different persons based on their appearances is a fuzzy attribute and may attain any degree over the [0,1] scale. But this cannot be captured by the multivalued default bilattice.\nBilattice-based square (Arieli et al., 2005) has been used for human detection in visual surveillance system. This algebraic structure is a better candidate than multivalued default bilattice as it provides continuous degrees of belief states.\nThe difference between bilattice-based square and bilattice-based triangle is that the former allows explicit representation of inconsistent information with different degrees inconsistency. But it is pointed out by Dubois (Dubois, 2008) that square-like bilattices, where explicit representations of unknown (\u30080, 0\u3009) and inconsistent (\u30081, 1\u3009) epistemic states are allowed, can not preserve classical tautologies and sometimes give rise to unintuitive results.\nHence, bilattice-based triangle seems to be the most dependable and suitable algebraic structure to be used in the aforementioned applications.\nNow let\u2019s apply the bilattice-based triangle to a slightly modified version of an example demonstrated by Shet et. al. (Shet et al., 2006a; Shet, Harwood, & Davis, 2006b) involving logical reasoning in identity maintenance. The example deals with determining whether two individuals observed in an image should be considered as being one and the same. The rules and facts along with the assigned epistemic states are as follows:\nrules: r1: \u03c6[appear similar(P1, P2) \u2212\u2192 equal(P1, P2)] = [0.5, 1] r2: \u03c6[distinct(P1, P2) \u2212\u2192 \u00acequal(P1, P2)] = [0.9, 1]\nfacts: f1: \u03c6[appear similar(a, b)] = [0.8, 0.8] f2: \u03c6[appear similar(c, d)] = [0.5, 0.5] f3: \u03c6[distinct(a, b)] = [1, 1]\nThe specified set of facts depicts that Individuals a and b are more similar than c and d. Rules r1 and r2 encode the judgments of two different information sources or different algorithms, none of which present a confident, full-proof answer. However rule r2 (which may be based on some information of higher priority) gives greater assurance to the non-equality of two persons than the assertion of equality guaranteed by rule r1, which may have came from a simple appearance matching technique of low dependability.\nIntuitively, from the given information, a rational agent would put more confidence to the fact that individuals a, b are not equal than on their equality; since the degree of distinction is more than the degree of similarity.The inference mechanism is specified in (Ginsberg, 1988). The closure operator over the truth assignment function \u03c6 (cl(\u03c6))denotes the truth assignment\nthat labels information entailed from the given set of rules and facts. The operator cl+(\u03c6)(q) takes into account set of rules that entail q and cl\u2212(\u03c6)(q) considers set of rules that entail \u00acq. Here the conjunctor, disjunctor and negator used are min, max and 1\u2212 operators respectively.\ncl+(\u03c6)(equal(a, b)) = [[0, 1] \u2228 ([0.8, 0.8] \u2227 [0.5, 1])] = [[0, 1] \u2228 [0.5, 0.8]] = [0.5, 0.8]\ncl \u2212 (\u03c6)(equal(a, b)) = \u00ac[[0, 1] \u2228 ([1, 1] \u2227 [0.9, 1])] = \u00ac[[0, 1] \u2228 [0.9, 1]] =\n[0, 0.1]\nNow the two intervals [0.5, 0.8] and [0, 0.1] are neither comparable with respect to \u2264k in Triangle nor they have a glbk in the Triangle structure. Thus the two intervals cannot be combined to get a single assertion for equal(a, b). Hence, using Triangle it is not possible to achieve the intended inference that a and b don\u2019t seem to be equal.\nThus the knowledge ordering in bilattice-based triangle must be modified in order to remove the aforementioned discrepancy. The modified knowledge ordering must incorporate within Triangle the ability to perform reasoning in presence of nonmonotonicity and demonstrate the repetitive belief revision as the default bilattice has."}, {"heading": "3.2 Truth ordering is not always accurate:", "text": "In the bilattice-based triangle, for two intervals [x1, x2] and [y1, y2], [x1, x2] \u2264t [y1, y2] iff x1 \u2264 y1 and x2 \u2264 y2. According to this ordering any two intervals x and y are incomparable if x is a proper sub-interval of y or vice versa, i.e. if one interval lies completely within the other with no common boundary. The justification behind this incomparability is that, if an interval, say y, is a proper sub-interval of x then the actual truth value approximated by interval x(x\u0302) may be greater or less than that of y\u0302. For instance, if x = [0.4, 0.8] and y = [0.5, 0.7] then x\u0302 can be less than y\u0302 ( if x\u0302 \u2208 [0.4, 0.5)) or x\u0302 can be greater than y\u0302 (if x\u0302 \u2208 (0.7, 0.8]).\nBut similar situation may arise even when two intervals are not proper sub-interval of one another but just overlap, e.g. say x = [0.4, 0.8] and y = [0.6, 0.9]. These intervals are t-comparable, i.e., [0.4, 0.8] \u2264t [0.6, 0.9]. Though, as the two intervals overlap, it is not ensured that the real truth value approximated by the lower interval will be smaller than the real truth value approximated by the higher interval (e.g. though x \u2264t y but it may be the case that x\u0302 = 0.75 and y\u0302 = 0.65). In this respect the comparibility of the two intervals is not justified. Therefore, it is not always the most accurate ordering and can be regarded as a \u201d weak truth ordering\u201d (Esteva,\nGarcia-Calve\u0301s, & Godo, 1994). The truth ordering must be modified in order to remove the anomaly, so that, if two overlapping intervals are (not) t-comparable, so would be two intervals - one lying inside the other."}, {"heading": "4 Modification in Triangle structure:", "text": "Based on the discussions in the above two subsections the bilattice-based triangle is modified."}, {"heading": "4.1 Modification in knowledge ordering:", "text": "The knowledge ordering can be defined based on just the length of intervals and irrespective of the real truth values they attempt to approximate.

Equality of the width of intervals is a necessary condition for x = y, but not a sufficient condition; because two different intervals may have equal width, e.g. [0.1, 0.2] and [0.7, 0.8].\nUsing this modified knowledge ordering(kp) the shortcomings demonstrated in sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 can be overcome.\n1. Interval [0.0] is placed higher in k-ordering than [0.5, 1] (since (1 \u2212 0.5) > (0\u22120))and thus the new ordering prompts to choose the definite fact \u201dTweety doesn\u2019t fly\u201d (with the assigned interval [0,0]) over the default fact \u201dTweety flies\u201d (with the assigned interval [0.5,1]).\n2. Since, [0.5, 0.8] \u2264kp [0, 0.1], thus glbk([0.5, 0.8], [0, 0.1]) = [0, 0.1], will be taken as the final assertion of equal(a, b) in the example shown in section 3.1.2. Hence using the modified knowledge ordering the intended inference that individuals a and b are not equal is achieved.\nThe algebraic structure for (I({0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1}),\u2264t ,\u2264kp) is shown in Fig. 4."}, {"heading": "4.2 Modification in Truth Ordering:", "text": "The truth ordering (\u2264t) gives rise to certain discrepancies in ordering intervals, as discussed in section 3.2. The justification in support of this weak truth ordering is (Deschrijver, 2009)\n\u201dx \u2264t y iff the probability that x\u0302 \u2264 y\u0302 is larger than x\u0302 \u2265 y\u0302\u201d (\u2217)\ni.e. the basic intuition behind truth ordering of intervals lies in comparing the probabilities Prob(x\u0302 \u2265 y\u0302) and Prob(x\u0302 \u2264 y\u0302). Lets take this statement as a starting point to revisit the truth ordering, especially in case when one interval is a proper sub-interval of the other.

The proof is constructed by considering several cases depending on how intervals x and y are situated on the [0, 1] scale. Without loss of generality it is assumed that x1 \u2264 y1 for showing the proof. For the other case, i.e. x1 > y1 similar proof can be constructed which is not shown here.\nSince any x \u2208 [x1, x2] is equally probable to be equal to x\u0302 (i.e. there is a uniform probability distribution over [x1, x2]) then for a sub-interval [a, b] of [x1, x2] we have, Prob(x\u0302 \u2208 [a, b]) = Prob(x\u0302 \u2208 (a, b]) = Prob(x\u0302 \u2208 [a, b)) = b\u2212a x2\u2212x1 .\nCase 1:\nSuppose, x = [x1, x2] has y = [y1, y2] as a proper sub-interval (Figure 5).

Case 1 in the above proof is particularly interesting, where one interval is a proper sub-interval of the other. Though the chosen intervals x and y are not comparable with respect to \u2264t ordering, but we can compare their midpoints and thus order the probabilities Prob(x\u0302 \u2265 y\u0302) and Prob(x\u0302 \u2264 y\u0302). Thus following statement (\u2217) a truth ordering can be imposed on x and y based on the probabilistic comparison. The existing truth ordering (\u2264t) as shown in Definition 2.2, doesn\u2019t allow this comparability of x and y, and hence a new truth ordering is called for.\nNow that we are able to estimate and order the probabilities, in light of statement (\u2217) we are in a place to construct a generalised truth ordering (\u2264tp) as follows:\nx \u2264tp y \u21d4 xm \u2264 ym.\nThe equality of midpoints of two intervals x and y, (i.e. x1+x22 = y1+y2\n2 ) is a necessary condition for x = y, but not a sufficient condition; because two different intervals can have same midpoint, as shown in Figure 8.\nMoreover, the discrepancy mentioned in section 3.2 is resolved, since cases where intervals are overlapped and when one interval is a proper subinterval of the other are treated uniformly and in each case intervals are comparable with respect to \u2264tp .\nTheorem 4.2. For two intervals x = [x1, x2] and y = [y1, y2] \u2208 L I , such that none is a proper subinterval of the other,\nx \u2264t y \u21d2 x \u2264tp y.\nProof. From the definition,\nx \u2264t y \u21d4 x1 \u2264 x2 and y1 \u2264 y2 \u21d2 x1 + x2 \u2264 y1 + y2 \u21d2 xm \u2264 ym \u21d2 x \u2264tp y.\nThus, the probabilistic analysis gives a broader truth ordering of the intervals that can be achieved by comparing midpoints of intervals. For each pair of intervals if they are comparable with respect to \u2264t they are also comparable with respect to the modified truth ordering \u2264tp and additionally \u2264tp can order intervals when one of them is a proper sub-interval of the other and hence are not \u2264t \u2212comparable.\nFor instance, for two intervals x = [0, 1] and y = [0.8, 0.9] we have [0, 1] <tp [0.8, 0.9] though x and y are not t-comparable w.r.t. \u2264t.\nThe algebraic structure for (I({0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1}),\u2264tp ,\u2264k) is shown in Figure 9."}, {"heading": "5 An alternative algebraic structure", "text": "Based on these modifications we propose a modified and more intuitive algebraic structure for ordering intervals with respect to degree of truth and knowledge (or certainty).\nNotation: For an interval x \u2208 LI ; xm and xw will be used to denote the midpoint (or center) and the length of the interval respectively; i.e. xm = (x1 + x2)/2 and xw = (x2 \u2212 x1). The pair (xm, xw) uniquely specifies an interval x and hence may be used instead of the traditional representation [x1, x2].\nDefinition 5.1. A preorder-based triangle is a structure P(L) = (LI ,\u2264tp ,\u2264kp), defined for every [x1, x2] and [y1, y2] \u2208 L\nI as: 1. [x1, x2] \u2264tp [y1, y2] \u21d4 xm \u2264 ym, 2. [x1, x2] \u2264kp [y1, y2] \u21d4 xw \u2265 yw, 3. x = y \u21d4 xm = ym and xw = yw.\nPreorder-based triangle can be defined for any subset of LI as well. For instance preorder-based triangle for I({0, 0.5, 1}) and for I({0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1}) are shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11 respectively. The dashed lines demonstrate the connections that were absent in the bilattice-based triangle.\nWith the truth and knowledge ordering presented in Definition 5.1 we step out of the realm of lattice-based structures. The substructure (LI ,\u2264tp) is not a lattice since for any two intervals a and b, existence of lubtp(a, b) and glbtp(a, b) are not guaranteed. For instance, suppose L = {0, 0.1, 0.2.., 1} i.e. the unit interval discretised with eleven equidistant points. Now, two intervals in I(L), [0.8, 0.8] and [0.6, 1] are incomparable with respect to \u2264tp . The upper bound of the two intervals is not a unique element, but a set of intervals {[0.7, 1], [0.8, 0.9]}. Hence lubtp doesn\u2019t exist. Lower bound of the two intervals is the set {[0.7, 0.8], [0.6, 0.9], [0.5, 1]}.\nThe ordering \u2264tp and \u2264kp over the set of intervals are not lattice-orders but pre-orders, i.e reflexive and transitive. The orderings are not symmetric clearly. Nor they are anti-symmetric, since [0.5, 0.5] \u2264tp [0, 1] and [0, 1] \u2264tp [0.5, 0.5] but [0.5, 0.5] 6= [0, 1] and similar example holds for the k-ordering. Thus the substructure (LI ,\u2264tp) and (L\nI ,\u2264kp) form pre-ordered sets instead of lattices. Moreover, in (LI ,\u2264kp) any set of intervals have lower bound but may not have upper bound. For instance, following the earlier example, intervals [0.5, 0.5] and [0.8, 0.8] doesn\u2019t have an upper bound, but has the set of intervals of length 0.1 as its lower bound.\nBecause of the modified knowledge ordering, the preorder-based triangle can be thought of as a unification of the default bilattice and the bilatticebased triangle.\nOne point must be emphasized here is that, bilattice-based triangle is a more generalised algebraic structure that can be defined for any set of intervals over any complete lattice. However, preorder-based triangle can only be defined over subintervals of [0, 1] (or any interval of real numbers), because intervals in general complete lattices may not have midpoints or lengths.\nDefinition 5.2. A set of intervals in LI is said to be an m-set for a specific value a \u2208 [0, 1] and is defined as:\nm\u2212 seta = {x|x \u2208 L I and xm = a}.\ni.e. the set of intervals incomparable with the interval [a, a] with respect to their degree of truth."}, {"heading": "6 Logical Operators on P(L)", "text": "All the logical operators, e.g. conjunction, disjunction, implication and negation, defined for bilattice-based triangle (B(L)) (Cornelis et al., 2007; Deschrijver et al., 2007) are applicable for preorder-based triangle (P(L)) as well.

Thus,\nx1 \u2264 y1 and y2 \u2264 x2\nHence, N(x1) \u2265 N(y1) and N(y2) \u2265 N(x2). Since, x \u2265tp y, x1 + x2 \u2265 y1 + y2. or, x2 \u2212 y2 \u2265 y1 \u2212 x1. Therefore, N(y2)\u2212N(x2) \u2265 N(x1)\u2212N(y1); since N is decreasing. or, N(y2) +N(y1) \u2265 N(x1) +N(x2). or, N(y) \u2265tp N(x). Thus, N is decreasing.\nCase 3: When x is a sub-interval of y. Then;\nx1 \u2265 y1 and y2 \u2265 x2\nHence, N(x1) \u2264 N(y1) and N(y2) \u2264 N(x2).

Thus, for all x, y \u2208 L I\neither TMinp(x, y) = x or TMinp(x, y) = y.\nTheorem 6.10. The t-norm TMinp, t-conorm SMinp and negator Ns forms a De-Morgan triplet, i.e. 1. TMinp(x, y) = Ns(SMinp(Ns(x),Ns(y))), 2. SMinp(x, y) = Ns(TMinp(Ns(x),Ns(y))). Proof. Consider two intervals x, y \u2208 LI . Part 1: First, suppose intervals x and y are comparable with respect to \u2264tp , and lets assume, without loss of generality x \u2265tp y. Thus TMinp(x, y) = y and SMinp(x, y) = x. Since Ns is decreasing with respect to the degree of truth, then Ns(x) \u2264tp Ns(y). So, from definition SMinp(Ns(x),Ns(y)) = Ns(y). Thus Ns(SMinp(Ns(x),Ns(y))) = y = TMinp(x, y).\nMoreover, if xm = ym (i.e. x and y are incomparable with respect to their degree of truth), and say, x \u2264kp y TMinp(x, y) = y. Since the negator Ns preserves the degree of knowledge and reverses the degree of truth, Ns(x) and Ns(y) are incomparable in t-ordering and Ns(x) \u2264kp Ns(y). Thus, from definition SMinp(Ns(x),Ns(y)) = Ns(y) and Ns(SMinp(Ns(x),Ns(y))) = y = TMinp(x, y).\nPart 2: If x \u2264tp y, then Ns(x) \u2265tp Ns(y) and TMinp(Ns(x),Ns(y)) = Ns(y). Thus Ns(TMinp(Ns(x),Ns(y))) = y = SMinp(x, y).\nMoreover, if xm = ym and say, x \u2264kp y SMinp(x, y) = y. The negator Ns being order preserving for k-ordering, Ns(x) \u2264kp Ns(y). Thus, from definition TMinp(Ns(x),Ns(y)) = Ns(y) and Ns(TMinp(Ns(x),Ns(y))) = y = SMinp(x, y).\nHence, the t-norm TMinp , t-conorm SMinp and negator Ns forms a DeMorgan triplet."}, {"heading": "6.2.2 Product t-norm and t-conorm", "text": "The product t-(co)norm is useful to model the conjunction of independent events in probabilistic semantics.

An implicator on (LI ,\u2264tp) is a hybrid monotonous L I \u00d7 LI \u2192 LI mapping I(i.e. a mapping with decreasing first and increasing second partial mapping) that satisfies I(0LI , 0LI ) = I(0LI , 1LI ) = I(1LI , 1LI ) = 1LI and I(1LI , 0LI ) = 0LI .\nOne of the common class of implicators are Strong-implicators or Simplicators in short.\nDefinition 6.16. For two intervals x, y \u2208 LI and any t-conorm S and negator N on (LI ,\u2264t) the S-implicator generated by S and N is\nIS,N (x, y) = S(N(x), y).\nThe S-implicators defined for the structure (LI ,\u2264tp) are similar to those defined for (LI ,\u2264t), and are not discussed further.\nThere is another important class of implicators, namely R-implicators, generated as residuum of some t-norms on (LI ,\u2264t). An R-implicator on (LI ,\u2264t) generated by a t-norm T is defined as:\nIR(x, y) = Sup{\u03b3 \u2208 L I |T(x, \u03b3) \u2264t y}.\nNow, because the definition involves truth ordering, the modified definition of \u2264tp demands modification to the definition of R-implicator.\nDefinition 6.17. For a t-norm T defined on (LI ,\u2264tp) an R-implicator generated from T is defined as:\nIRtp (x, y) = Suptp{\u03b3 \u2208 L I |T(x, \u03b3) \u2264tp y or [T(x, \u03b3)]m = ym}\nwhere, Suptp is the interval having maximum degree of truth. Sometimes, instead of a unique value, the operation Suptp may give a set of intervals belonging to the same m-set and hence IRtp (x, y) may not be unique.\nExample: Suppose L = ([0, 1],\u2264) and the t-norm is TMinp . Then the R-implicator generated from this t-norm is given by:\nIMin = Suptp{\u03b3 \u2208 L I |TMinp(x, \u03b3) \u2264tp y or [TMinp(x, \u03b3)]m = ym}.\n1. If x \u2264tp y, for any \u03b3 \u2208 L I , TMinp(x, \u03b3) \u2264tp y. Thus, IMin = [1, 1].\n2. If xm = ym, then for any \u03b3 \u2265tp x, [TMinp(x, \u03b3)]m = ym. Thus, IMin = [1, 1].\n3. If x \u2265tp y, then for any interval \u03b3 with \u03b3m = ym, we have [TMinp(x, \u03b3)]m = ym. Thus, IMin = \u03b3 s.t. \u03b3m = ym. Hence, the implicator does not give a unique element, but an m\u2212 seta of intervals with a = ym.\nExample: Suppose L = ([0, 1],\u2264) and the t-norm is Tpr. Then the R-implicator generated from this t-norm is given by:\nIpr = Suptp{\u03b3 \u2208 L I |Tpr(x, \u03b3) \u2264tp y or [Tpr(x, \u03b3)]m = ym}.\nor, in other words,\nIpr = Suptp{\u03b3 \u2208 L I |(x1 \u00d7 \u03b31 + x2 \u00d7 \u03b32 \u2264 y1 + y2) or (x1 \u00d7 \u03b31 = y1 and\nx2 \u00d7 \u03b32 = y2)}.\nCase 1: If x1 + x2 \u2264 y1 + y2; Ipr = [1, 1].

The structure, preorder-based triangle, together with the logical operators defined on it, provides a framework for reasoning with imprecise, uncertain and incomplete information. Unlike bilattice-based triangle, the preorder-based triangle is capable of handling repetitive belief revisions in nonmonotonic reasoning. Moreover the truth ordering in the new structure is more intuitive. The fact that the knowledge and truth order now become fully orthogonal does have a strong appeal in application areas involving nonmonotonic logical reasoning with vague and\nincomplete information. As demonstrated here, all the operators defined for bilattice-based triangles are suitable for the proposed structure as well and the modified truth ordering invokes some new logical connectives with interesting properties. Thus, the proposed preorder-based structure can be considered as an enhancement to bilattice-based triangle.\nThis work is an preliminary analysis of the necessity of preorder-based triangle and its pros and cons, and leaves enough scope for further investigation and analysis."}], "references": [{"title": "Relating intuitionistic fuzzy sets and interval-valued fuzzy sets through bilattices", "author": ["O.
