And because speech transcription is a costly and slow process, speech is more likely to be annotated with translations than with transcriptions. This translated speech is a potentially valuable source of information \u2013 for example, for documenting endangered languages or for training speech translation systems.\nIn language documentation, data is usable only if it is interpretable. To make a collection of speech data usable for future studies of the language, something resembling interlinear glossed text (transcription, morphological analysis, word glosses, free translation) would be needed at minimum. New\ntechnologies are being developed to facilitate collection of translations (Bird et al., 2014), and there already exist recent examples of parallel speech collection efforts focused on endangered languages (Blachon et al., 2016; Adda et al., 2016). As for the other annotation layers, one might hope that a first pass could be done automatically. A first step towards this goal would be to automatically align spoken words with their translations, capturing information similar to that captured by word glosses.\nIn machine translation, statistical models have traditionally required alignments between the source and target languages as the first step of training. Therefore, producing alignments between speech and text would be a natural first step towards MT systems operating directly on speech.\nWe present a model that, in order to learn such alignments, adapts and combines two components: Dyer et al.\u2019s reparameterization of IBM Model 2 (Dyer et al., 2013), more commonly known as fast_align, and k-means clustering using Dynamic Time Warping (Berndt and Clifford, 1994) as a distance metric. The two components are trained jointly using expectation-maximization.\nWe experiment on two language pairs. One is Spanish-English, using the CALLHOME and Fisher corpora. The other is Griko-Italian; Griko is an endangered language for which we created (and make freely available)1 gold-standard translations and word alignments (Lekakou et al., 2013). In all cases, our model outperforms both a naive but strong baseline and a neural model (Duong et al., 2016).\n1https://www3.nd.edu/\u02dcaanastas/griko/\ngriko-data.tar.gz\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n08 13\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n6 Se\np 20"}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "In this section, we briefly describe the existing models that the two components of our model are based on. In the next section, we will describe how we adapt and combine them to the present task.\n2.1 IBM Model 2 and fast_align\nThe IBM translation models (Brown et al., 1993) aim to model the distribution p(e | f) for an English sentence e = e1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 el, given a French sentence f = f1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 em. They all introduce a hidden variable a = a1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 al that gives the position of the French word to which each English word is aligned.\nThe general form of IBM Models 1, 2 and fast_align is\np(e, a | f) = p(l) l\u220f\ni=1\nt(ei | fai) \u03b4(ai | i, l,m)\nwhere t(e | f ) is the probability of translating French word f to English word e, and \u03b4(ai = j | i, l,m) is the probability of aligning the i-th English word with the j-th French word.\nIn Model 1, \u03b4 is uniform; in Model 2, it is a categorical distribution. Dyer et al. (2013) propose a reparameterization of Model 2, known as fast_align:\nh(i, j, l,m) = \u2212 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 il \u2212 jm \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b4(ai | i, l,m) =\np0 ai = 0(1 \u2212 p0) exp \u03bbh(i,ai,l,m)Z\u03bb(i,l,m) ai > 0 where the null alignment probability p0 and precision \u03bb \u2265 0 are hyperparameters optimized by grid search. As \u03bb \u2192 0, the distribution gets closer to the distribution of IBM Model 1, and as \u03bb gets larger, the model prefers monotone word alignments more strongly."}, {"heading": "2.2 DTW and DBA", "text": "Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) (Berndt and Clifford, 1994) is a dynamic programming method for measuring distance between two temporal sequences of variable length, as well as computing an alignment based on this distance. Given two sequences \u03c6, \u03c6\u2032 of length m and m\u2032 respectively, DTW\nconstructs an m\u00d7m\u2032 matrix w. The warping path can be found by evaluating the following recurrence:\nwi, j = d(\u03c6i, \u03c6\u2032j) + min{wi\u22121, j,wi\u22121, j\u22121,wi, j\u22121}\nwhere d is a distance metric. In this paper, we normalize the cost of the warping path:\nDTW(\u03c6, \u03c6\u2032) = wm,m\u2032\nm + m\u2032\nwhich lies between zero and one. DTW Barycenter Averaging (DBA) (Petitjean et al., 2011) is an iterative approximate method that attempts to find a centroid of a set of sequences, minimizing the sum of squared DTW distances.\nIn the original definition, given a set of sequences, DBA chooses one sequence randomly to be a \u201cskeleton.\u201d Then, at each iteration, DBA computes the DTW between the skeleton and every sequence in the set, aligning each of the skeleton\u2019s points with points in all the sequences. The skeleton is then refined using the found alignments, by updating each frame in the skeleton to the mean of all the frames aligned to it. In our implementation, in order to avoid picking a skeleton that is too short or too long, we randomly choose one of the sequences with median length."}, {"heading": "3 Model", "text": "We use a generative model from a source-language speech segment consisting of feature frames \u03c6 = \u03c61 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6m to a target-language segment consisting of words e = e1 . . . el. We chose to model p(e | \u03c6) rather than p(\u03c6 | e) because it makes it easier to incorporate DTW. The other direction is also possible, and we plan to explore it in future work.\nIn addition to the target-language sentence e, our model hypothesizes a sequence f = f1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 fl of source-language clusters (intuitively, sourcelanguage words), and spans (ai, bi) of the source signal that each target word ei is aligned to. Thus, the clusters f = f1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 fl and the spans a = a1, . . . , al and b = b1, . . . , bl are the hidden variables of the model:\np(e | \u03c6) = \u2211 a,b,f p(e, a,b, f | \u03c6).\nThe model generates e, a,b, and f from \u03c6 as follows.\n1. Choose l, the number of target words, with uniform probability. (Technically, this assumes a maximum target sentence length, which we can just set to be very high.)\n2. For each target word position i = 1, . . . , l:\n(a) Choose a cluster fi. (b) Choose a span of source frames (ai, bi) for\nei to be aligned to. (c) Generate a target word ei from fi.\nAccordingly, we decompose p(e, a,b, f | \u03c6) into several submodels:\np(e, a,b, f | \u03c6) = p(l) l\u220f\ni=1\nu( fi) \u00d7\ns(ai, bi | fi,\u03c6) \u00d7 \u03b4(ai, bi | i, l, |\u03c6|) \u00d7 t(ei | fi).\nNote that submodels \u03b4 and s both generate spans (corresponding to step 2b), making the model deficient. We could make the model sum to one by replacing u( fi)s(ai, bi | fi,\u03c6) with s( fi | ai, bi,\u03c6), and this was in fact our original idea, but the model as defined above works much better, as discussed in Section 7.4. We describe both \u03b4 and s in detail below.\nClustering model The probability over clusters, u( f ), is just a categorical distribution. The submodel s assumes that, for each cluster f , there is a \u201cprototype\u201d signal \u03c6 f (cf. Ristad and Yianilos, 1998). Technically, the \u03c6 f are parameters of the model, and will be recomputed during the M step. Then we can define:\ns(a, b | f ,\u03c6) = exp(\u2212DTW(\u03c6 f , \u03c6a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6b)2)\u2211m\na,b=1 exp(\u2212DTW(\u03c6 f , \u03c6a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6b)2)\nwhere DTW is the distance between the prototype and the segment computed using Dynamic Time Warping. Thus s assigns highest probability to spans of \u03c6 that are most similar to the prototype \u03c6 f .\nDistortion model The submodel \u03b4 controls the reordering of the target words relative to the source frames. It is an adaptation of fast_align to our\nsetting, where there is not a single source word position ai, but a span (ai, bi). We want the model to prefer the middle of the word to be close to the diagonal, so we need the variable a to be somewhat to the left and b to be somewhat to the right. Therefore, we introduce an additional hyperparameter \u00b5 which is intuitively the number of frames in a word. Then we define\nha(i, j, l,m, \u00b5) = \u2212 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 il \u2212 jm \u2212 \u00b5 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 hb(i, j, l,m, \u00b5) = \u2212 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 il \u2212 j \u2212 \u00b5m \u2212 \u00b5 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03b4a(ai | i, l,m) = p0 ai = 0(1 \u2212 p0) exp \u03bbha(i,ai,l,m)Z\u03bb(i,l,m) ai > 0\n\u03b4b(bi | i, l,m) = p0 bi = 0(1 \u2212 p0) exp \u03bbhb(i,bi,l,m)Z\u03bb(i,l,m) bi > 0\n\u03b4(ai, bi | i, l,m) = \u03b4a(ai | i, l,m) \u03b4b(bi | i, l,m)\nwhere the Z\u03bb(i, l,m) are set so that all distributions sum to one. Figure 1 shows an example visualisation of the the resulting distributions for the two variables of our model.\nWe set \u00b5 differently for each word. For each i, we set \u00b5i to be proportional to the number of characters in ei, such that \u2211 i \u00b5i = m.\nTranslation model The translation model t(e | f ) is just a categorical distribution, in principle allowing a many-to-many relation between source clusters and target words. To speed up training (with nearly no change in accuracy, in our experiments), we restrict this relation so that there are k source clusters for each target word, and a source cluster uniquely determines its target word. Thus, t(e | f ) is fixed to\neither zero or one, and does not need to be reestimated. In our experiments, we set k = 2, allowing each target word to have up to two source-language translations/pronunciations. (If a source word has more than one target translation, they are treated as distinct clusters with distinct prototypes.)"}, {"heading": "4 Training", "text": "We use the hard (Viterbi) version of the ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of our model, because calculating expected counts in full EM would be prohibitively expensive, requiring summations over all possible alignments.\nRecall that the hidden variables of the model are the alignments (ai, bi) and the source words ( fi). The parameters are the translation probabilities t(ei | f ) and the prototypes (\u03c6 f ). The (hard) E step uses the current model and prototypes to find, for each target word, the best source segment to align it to and the best source word. The M step reestimates the probabilities t(e | f ) and the prototypes \u03c6 f . We describe each of these steps in more detail below.\nInitialization Initialization is especially important since we are using hard EM.\nTo initialize the parameters, we initialize the hidden variables and then perform an M step. We associate each target word type e with k = 2 source clusters, and for each occurrence of e, we randomly assign it one of the k source clusters.\nThe alignment variables ai, bi are initialized to\nai, bi = arg max a,b \u03b4(a, b | i, l,m).\nM step The M step reestimates the probabilities t(e | f ) using relative-frequency estimation.\nThe prototypes \u03c6 f are more complicated. Theoretically, the M step should recompute each \u03c6 f so as to maximize that part of the log-likelihood that depends on \u03c6 f :\nL\u03c6 f = \u2211 \u03c6 \u2211 i| fi= f log s(ai, bi | f ,\u03c6)\n= \u2211 \u03c6 \u2211 i| fi= f log exp(\u2212DTW(\u03c6 f , \u03c6ai \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6bi)2) Z( f ,\u03c6)\n= \u2211 \u03c6 \u2211 i| fi= f \u2212DTW(\u03c6 f , \u03c6ai \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6bi)2 \u2212 log Z( f ,\u03c6)\nwhere the summation over \u03c6 is over all source signals in the training data. This is a hard problem, but note that the first term is just the sum-of-squares of the DTW distance between \u03c6 f and all source segments that are classified as f . This is what DBA is supposed to approximately minimize, so we simply set \u03c6 f using DBA, ignoring the denominator.\nE step The (hard) E step uses the current model and prototypes to find, for each target word, the best source segment to align it to and the best source cluster.\nIn order to reduce the search space for a and b, we use the unsupervised phonetic boundary detection method of Khanagha et al. (2014). This method operates directly on the speech signal and provides us with candidate phone boundaries, on which we restrict the possible values for a and b, creating a list of candidate utterance spans.\nFurthermore, we use a simple silence detection method. We pass the envelope of the signal through a low-pass filter, and then mark as \u201csilence\u201d time spans of 50ms or longer in which the magnitude is below a threshold of 5% relative to the maximum of the whole signal. This method is able to detect about 80% of the total pauses, with a 90% precision in a 50ms window around the correct silence boundary. We can then remove from the candidate list the utterance spans that include silence, on the assumption that a word should not include silences. Finally, in case one of the span\u2019s boundaries happens to be within a silence span, we also move it so as to not include the silence.\nHyperparameter tuning The hyperparameters p0, \u03bb, and \u00b5 are not learned. We simply set p0 to zero (disallowing unaligned target words) and set \u00b5 as described above.\nFor \u03bbwe perform a grid search over candidate values to maximize the alignment F-score on the development set. We obtain the best scores with \u03bb = 0.5."}, {"heading": "5 Related Work", "text": "A first step towards modelling parallel speech can be performed by modelling phone-to-word alignment, instead of directly working on continuous speech. For example, Stahlberg et al. (2012) extend IBM Model 3 to align phones to words in order to build\ncross-lingual pronunciation lexicons. Pialign (Neubig et al., 2012) aligns characters and can be applied equally well to phones. Duong et al. (2016) use an extension of the neural attentional model of Bahdanau et al. (2015) for aligning phones to words and speech to words; we discuss this model below in Section 6.2.\nThere exist several supervised approaches that attempt to integrate speech recognition and machine translation. However, they rely heavily on the abundance of training data, pronunciation lexicons, or language models, and therefore cannot be applied in a low- or zero-resource setting.\nA task somewhat similar to ours, which operates at a monolingual level, is the task of zero-resource spoken term discovery, which aims to discover repeated words or phrases in continuous speech. Various approaches (Ten Bosch and Cranen, 2007; Park and Glass, 2008; Muscariello et al., 2009; Zhang and Glass, 2010; Jansen et al., 2010) have been tried, in order to spot keywords, using segmental DTW to identify repeated trajectories in the speech signal.\nKamper et al. (2016) try to discover word segmentation and a pronunciation lexicon in a zero-resource setting, combining DTW with acoustic embeddings; their methods operate in a very low-vocabulary setting. Bansal (2015) attempts to build a speech translation system in a low-resource setting, by using as source input the simulated output of an unsupervised term discovery system."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments", "text": "We evaluate our method on two language pairs, Spanish-English and Griko-Italian, against two baseline methods, a naive baseline, and the model of Duong et al.

(2013). Spanish is obviously not a low-resource language, but we pretend that it is low-resource by not making use of any Spanish ASR or resources like transcribed speech or pronunciation lexicons.\nSince there do not exist gold standard alignments between the Spanish speech and English words, we use the \u201csilver\u201d standard alignments produced by Duong et al. (2016) for the CALLHOME corpus, and followed the same procedure for the Fisher corpus as well. In order to obtain them, they first used a forced aligner to align the speech to its transcription, and GIZA++ with the gdfa symmetrization heuristic to align the Spanish transcription to the English translation. They then combined the two alignments to produce \u201csilver\u201d standard alignments between the Spanish speech and the English words.\nThe CALLHOME dataset consists of 17532 Spanish utterances, based on the dialogue turns. We first use a sample of 2000 sentences, out of which we use 200 as a development set and the rest as a test set. We also run our experiments on the whole dataset, selecting 500 utterances for a development set, using the rest as a test set. The Fisher dataset consists of 143355 Spanish utterances.

Although the corpus is very small, we use it to showcase the effectiveness of our method in a hard setting with extremely low resources.\nAll utterances were manually annotated and transcribed by a trained linguist and bilingual speaker of both languages, who produced the Griko transcriptions and Italian glosses.

Our model, when compared to the baselines, improves greatly on precision, while slightly underperforming the naive baseline on recall. In certain applications, higher precision may be desirable: for example, in language documentation, it\u2019s probably better to err on the side of precision; in phrase-based translation, higher-precision alignments lead to more extracted phrases.\nThe rest of the section provides a further analysis of the results, focusing on the extremely lowresource Griko-Italian dataset."}, {"heading": "7.2 Speaker robustness", "text": "Figure 2 shows the alignments produced by our model for three utterances of the same sentence from the Griko-Italian dataset by three different speakers.

As shown in Figure 3, the longer the word\u2019s utterance, the easier it is for our model to correctly align it. Longer utterances seem to carry enough information for our DTW-based metric to function properly. On the other hand, shorter utterances are harder to align. The vast majority of Griko utterances that have less than 20 frames and are less accurately aligned correspond to monosyllabic determiners (o, i,a, to, ta) or conjunctions and prepositions (ka, ce, en, na, an). For such short utterances, there could be several parts of the signal that possibly match the prototype, leading the clustering component to prefer to align to wrong spans.\nFurthermore, we note that rare word types tend to be correctly aligned. The average F-score for hapax legomena (on the Italian side) is 63.2, with 53% of them being aligned with an F-score higher than 70.0."}, {"heading": "7.4 Comparison with proper model", "text": "As mentioned in Section 3, our model is deficient, but it performs much better than the model that sums to one (henceforth, the \u201cproper\u201d model): In the Spanish-English dataset (2000 sentences sample) the proper model yields an F-score of 32.1, performing worse than the naive baseline; in the Griko-\nItalian dataset, it achieves an F-score of 44.3, which is better than the baselines, but still worse than our model.\nIn order to further examine why this happens, we performed three EM iterations on the Griko-Italian dataset with our model (in our experience, three iterations are usually enough for convergence), and then computed one more E step with both our model and the proper model, so as to ensure that the two models would align the dataset using the exact same prototypes and that their outputs will be comparable.\nIn this case, the proper model achieved an overall F-score of 44.0, whereas our model achieved an F-score of 53.6. Figures 4 and 5 show the resulting alignments for two sentences. In both of these examples, it is clear that the proper model prefers extreme spans: the selected spans are either much too short or\n(less frequently) much too long. This is further verified by examining the statistics of the alignments: the average span selected by the proper model has a length of about 30 \u00b1 39 frames whereas the average span of the alignments produced by our deficient model is 37 \u00b1 24 frames. This means that the alignments of the deficient model are much closer to the gold ones, whose average span is 42 \u00b1 26 frames.\nWe think that this is analogous to the \u201cgarbage collection\u201d problem in word alignment. In the IBM word alignment models, if a source word f occurs in only one sentence, then EM can align many target words to f and learn a very peaked distribution t(e | f ). This can happen in our model and the proper model as well, of course, since IBM Model 2 is embedded in them. But in the proper model, something similar can also happen with s( f | a, b): EM can make the span (a, b) large or small, and evidently making the span small allows it to learn a very peaked distribution s( f | a, b). By contrast, our model has s(a, b | f ), which seems less susceptible to this kind of effect."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "Alignment of speech to text translations is a relatively new task, one with particular relevance for low-resource or endangered languages. The model we propose here, which combines fast_align and k-means clustering using DTW and DBA, outperforms both a very strong naive baseline and a neural attentional model, on three tasks of various sizes.\nThe language pairs that we work on do not have very much word reordering, and more divergent lan-\nguage pairs should prove more challenging. In that case, the naive baseline should be much less competitive. Similarly, the fast_align-based distortion model may become less appopriate; we could turn the hyperparameter \u03bb down, bringing it closer to IBM Model 1, but we plan to try incorporating IBM Model 3 or the HMM alignment model (Vogel et al., 1996) instead.\nFinally, we will investigate downstream applications of our alignment methods, in the areas of both language documentation and speech translation."}], "references": [{"title": "Breaking the unwritten language barrier: The BULB", "author": ["Adda et al.2016] Gilles Adda", "Sebastian St\u00fcker", "Martine Adda-Decker", "Odette Ambouroue", "Laurent Besacier", "David Blachon", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Bonneau-Maynard", "Pierre Godard", "Fatima Hamlaoui", "Dmitry Idiatov"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Adda et al\\.,? \\Q2016\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Adda et al\\.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate", "author": ["Kyunghyun Cho", "Yoshua Bengio"], "venue": "In Proceedings of ICLR", "citeRegEx": "Bahdanau et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bahdanau et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Speech translation without speech recognition.
