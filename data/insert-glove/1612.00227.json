They have quite different properties, starting from the way they relate to time and space: objects are primarily related to space while events to time. Furthermore, in reading a book, the book (an object) is wholly present at any time during the reading (an event), while some temporal parts of the reading are not. These examples also show the role of the participation relation between objects and events: an object exists in time by participating in some event (the reader and the book participate in the reading event), and an event is spatially located where its participants are [17].\nWhile research on knowledge extraction from text has traditionally concentrated on objects and their properties. Systems for automatic extraction of semantic information about events are more recent and have largely ignored the events\u2019 ontological structure. These tools (e.g., NewsReader [19], Pikes [8]) are clearly important and can be further exploited for other tasks. By generating RDF datasets focused on (text extracted) events, they make possible to use RDF knowledge to reason over the detected events, so that one can now automatically infer new facts. This opportunity allows, for example, to identify conflicting information within and across event knowledge, as well as to discover implicit relationships between events.\nAs said, text based tasks for event recognition, as for example event coreference (i.e. recognizing whether two textual descriptions refer to the same event), do not typically take into account ontological information of the extracted events in their process. In this paper, we aim to show that an ontological analysis of event types [18] contributes positively in this endeavor. To achieve this, we propose a method to derive event coreference on text extracted event data using rule reasoning on the base of a well-founded ontological description of events and their relations. Our proposed method goes as follows:\nar X\niv :1\n61 2.\n00 22\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 D\nec 2\n01 6\n\u2013 We first provide a formal analysis on events and event types by isolating relevant ontological properties. \u2013 On the base of this, we consider a set of criteria to discover (probable) coreferring events. \u2013 We then implement these criteria as RDF-based reasoning rules to be applied on text extracted\nevent data. \u2013 Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach over a standard coreference benchmark\ndataset.\nIn particular, we will exemplify and evaluate our approach on a known benchmark for the evaluation of event coreference, the EventCorefBank (ECB)3 [3] corpus. In presenting each step of our approach, we describe how it has been applied to the events and event types in the corpus and, finally, we show an experimental evaluation of our implementation over the dataset.\nOur goal is to demonstrate that, by taking into account the ontological properties of events and their formalization as reasoning rules, it is possible to provide enough flexibility to manage typically large, noisy and incorrect knowledge about text extracted events. We insist that the ontology-based rules provide an additional means for knowledge extraction and should not be considered an alternative to other types of rules.\nThe main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n\u2013 We first propose (in Section 2) a formal analysis of the ontological properties of events and we define our event model. \u2013 In Section 3 we consider the event extraction task and we define a set of tasks (in Section 4) that can be solved via reasoning on the formal representation in our model. \u2013 Then, in Section 5 we consider the particular task of event coreference and we provide its formal characterization. \u2013 Finally, in Section 6 we describe an implementation and evaluation of the approach over the ECB corpus."}, {"heading": "2 Events and Event descriptions", "text": "We start by stating a formal ontological definition of event, adapted from the approach followed in DOLCE [4]:\nAn Event is a happening, that is, an entity directly related to time and (indirectly) related to space via its participants [4].\nWe slightly simplify this view by rephrasing the notion as follows:\nAn Event identifies a spatio-temporal region, some relevant entities in it, and what happens to these entities.\nAs usual, we divide the happenings in types depending on the changes that occur to the participants during the time spanned by the event. Formally, we characterize events via four features that we take as ontologically necessary for an event to occur:\n1. Event type (i.e. the type of happening) 2. Participant(s) with their thematic role in the event (i.e. their relevance in the event) 3. Time of happening 4. Global happening location\nFor time and location features we might agree on a specified granularity. Note that an event must have at least one participant. We will typically distinguish agents (persons, organisms etc.) Vs. non-agents (objects and materials) as participants. However, the terms \u2018active\u2019, \u2018passive\u2019 and \u2018tool\u2019 participant are borrowed from the linguistic terminology. For specific types of events, one might also define the \u201cmain\u201d participants, i.e. those that characterize and identify an event, and the \u201caccessory\u201d participants.\nWe use the term \u2018role\u2019 in the ontological sense: the function played by the participant in the event (e.g. a person having the role of public officer in an arrest).\nMoreover, we concentrate in particular on facts, i.e., events that actually happened (and not, for example, hypothetical happenings or descriptions of events as reported in speeches).\n3 http://adi.bejan.ro/data/ECB1.0.tar.gz"}, {"heading": "2.1 Formal analysis of event types", "text": "On the base of this, we can refine the four features by providing a characterization of event types by the following points:\nOntological classification: classification of the event type with respect to DOLCE definition of events (i.e. accomplishments or achievements) [4].

The EventCorefBank (ECB) corpus [3] is a known testset for event coreference. It consists of 482 news texts divided in 43 different topics. A total of 1744 event mentions are annotated, corresponding to 339 distint events. We chose to work on this corpus because it offers a small but relevant set of event types.\nWe chose 6 of the more representative event (facts) types in the collection (namely: Arresting, Killing, Dying, Charging, Shooting, Attacking) and we applied to them our formal analysis. We note that these types of event are closely connected and can give rise to interesting coreference examples. The complete results of the analysis on such event types are provided in Appendix A. For example, in Table 1 we present the analysis of the Killing event type. We note that this initial analysis in our approach requires the most effort to be completed4: on the other hand, once this effort is completed, the information can be used to define sets of reasoning rules for different tasks and independent from the size and quality of the processed event data. Note that, for some of the event types, their linguistic interpretation (viz. their definition provided in FrameNet) covers multiple types in the ontological classification (e.g., Arresting defines both the instantaneous act of seizing someone as well as the whole process of searching, seizing and taking the person into custody). In the current experiment we chose only one of the interpretations (e.g. we consider Arresting as an achievement) in order to define an univocal set of coreference rules: however, in a more complete characterization, one may define different analysis for both interpretations and infer from the text context which one is intended."}, {"heading": "3 Event extraction from text", "text": "Information about events can be gathered from many resources.

Graphical representation of the output produced by Pikes on the example sentence.\nThe growing maturity level of NLP techniques makes now possible to automatic process large amount of textual resources and extract information about the events mentioned in the text. The output however cannot be considered as certain information, as errors might occurs in the extraction process, or wrong information could be present in the source text.\nTypically, various types of information about events can be automatically extracted from a text corpus. We review them looking at the output produced by one of the state-of-the-art tools for knowledge extraction, Pikes [8].\nPikes is a Knowledge Extraction framework adopting a 2-phase approach. First\u2014phase 1: linguistic feature extraction\u2014an RDF graph of mentions is built by distilling the output of several state-of-the-art NLP tools, including Stanford CoreNLP5 (tokenization, POS-tagging, lemmatization, NERC, TERN, parsing and coreference resolution), UKB6 (WSD), DBpedia Spotlight7 (EL), Mate-tools8 and Semafor9 (SRL). Then\u2014phase 2: knowledge distillation\u2014the mention graph is processed to distill the knowledge graph using SPARQL-like mapping rules, which are evaluated using RDFpro10 [7], an RDF manipulation tool used also for RDFS reasoning.\nThe RDF knowledge graph returned by Pikes contains various typologies of content, that we illustrate using as example the output produced when parsing the sentence \u201cOn December 8, 1980, in NYC, Mark Chapman killed John Lennon.\u201d (see Figure 1 for a graphical rendering of the output produced or directly access the online demo on Pikes web-site11):\n5 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml 6 http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/ukb/ 7 http://spotlight.dbpedia.org/ 8 http://code.google.com/p/mate-tools/ 9 http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/SEMAFOR/\n10 http://rdfpro.fbk.eu/ 11 http://pikes.fbk.eu\n\u2013 event instances (e.g., \u201ckill\u201d), typed with respect to known ontological (e.g., FrameBase12, SUMO13) and linguistic resources (e.g., FrameNet14, VerbNet15); \u2013 event participants (e.g., \u201cdbpedia:John Lennon\u201d), i.e., individuals possibly linked to typed instances in linked data repositories (e.g., DBpedia16); \u2013 role of participants in the event (e.g., \u201ckilling-victim\u201d), according to role catalogs taken from available ontological (e.g., FrameBase) and linguistic resources (e.g., FrameNet, VerbNet); \u2013 temporal information (e.g., \u201c19801208\u201d), grounding the event in time, formalized according to reference time ontology (e.g., OWL-time17); \u2013 location information (e.g., \u201cdbpedia:New York City\u201d), grounding the event geographically.\nThis output perfectly fits the 4-feature ontologically necessary characterization of events introduced at the beginning of Section 2."}, {"heading": "4 Ontological-based reasoning tasks for events", "text": "Provided the formal ontological characterization of event types presented in the analysis in Section 2, our goal is to demonstrate that this knowledge enables us to deal with different high-level reasoning tasks on events and their properties. In the following, we briefly exemplify some of these possible tasks and, following our approach, we mention what kind of information from the ontological analysis can be used; in the remainder of the paper, we will then turn our attention to the specific task of event coreference.\nPre- and Post-condition inference. One task regards the ability to reason on the states that enable the activation of an event (i.e. its pre-conditions), the effects on the knowledge that the event produces on the state (i.e. its post-conditions), and possibly the facts that are true during the event execution (aka \u201cimplied situations\u201d in [22]). For example, supposing that we extract the event \u201cJohn has been hired by Google\u201d, then we would like to be able to infer that before this event \u201cJohn was not working in Google\u201d while later this fact is true.\nThe ontological properties that can be used for this task are clearly the information about status before, during and after events and possibly information on super- and sub-events with their associated knowledge content.\nCompletion of missing events. Another reasoning task can regard the inference of missing or implicit events and the completion of the events set on the base of the available event information. For example, suppose that we detect the two events \u201cJobs is the CEO of Apple\u201d, and \u201cCook is the CEO of Apple\u201d at different dates. We would like to infer that an event of the appointing of the new CEO of Apple has happened between the two events.\nIn this case, the useful ontological features can regard the status before, during and after the event, the possible asserted relations across event types (e.g. causality) and the local information about the participants.\nEvent information refinement. On the base of the ontological information, we might also want to refine the extracted information associated to an event in order to reach a more fine grained representation of the event local knowledge. This can be achieved possibly using contextual information known from the previously recognized events or background knowledge. For instance, suppose that we extract the event \u201cThe president visited the capital of France and met the prime minister\u201d in the time period of July 2016 and American politics news, then we might infer that \u201cBarack Obama visited Paris and met Manuel Valls\u201d.\nThis task requires ontological information about roles and the ability to reason with contextual information (e.g. on the time and location of the event occurence).\nIncompatible events. From the text extraction, we can obtain two events that have incompatible information (e.g. possibly coming from different sources): we want to be able to find that the"}, {"heading": "12 http://www.framebase.org/", "text": ""}, {"heading": "13 http://www.adampease.org/OP/", "text": ""}, {"heading": "14 http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/", "text": ""}, {"heading": "15 https://verbs.colorado.edu/~mpalmer/projects/verbnet.html", "text": ""}, {"heading": "16 http://dbpedia.org/", "text": "17 https://www.w3.org/2006/time\nhappening is the same but the information is incompatible (due to errors or simply different versions of the facts). For example, we might have that a news reports \u201cLast night, John Smith killed two people with a knife\u201d while another news might report \u201cLast night, an unidentified suspect killed a woman with a knife\u201d: without knowing which version of the facts actually happened, we want to be able to assert that the two descriptions are incompatible.\nTo be able to obtain these inferences, we might want to compare the event descriptions that refer to the same event with respect to their roles, time and location in order to recognize the incompatible information and use information about incompatible states."}, {"heading": "5 Event coreference task", "text": "In the following, we will first provide a definition of event coreference, then we show how the task of coreference discovery has been formalized and implemented in our experiments on the base of the ontological representation of events."}, {"heading": "5.1 Coreference definition", "text": "In this paper, we define event coreference as an equivalence relation \u2261c among events: e1 \u2261c e2 holds when events e1 and e2 describe the same happening or parts of the same happening regarding the four characterizing features described in Section 2. In other terms, the features of e1 and e2 identify different classifications (perspectives) of the same happening or the set of features of e1 (e2) identifies a part of the happening identified by e2 (e2, resp.ly).\nNote that even when event coreference holds between two events e1 and e2, these events can still differ in terms of information content. For instance, if the event is an olympic race, e1 may have information about the weather during the race which might not be available in event e2. Indeed, for event coreference to be satisfied it suffices that they both have the same information regarding the event type (a race), time, participants and location.\nThe task that we consider with respect to event coreference is to determine the existence and degree of truth to which a coreference relation exists based on the related data on the events. Our underlying hypothesis is that an analysis at the event level, based on the proposed ontological properties and linguistic resources (e.g. FrameNet [2]), can emend and complete the information extracted from single event detection."}, {"heading": "5.2 Coreference measure and aggregation", "text": "We can formally define a coreference measure and a relation to aggregate event descriptions as follows.\nWe call a coreference measure \u00b5t for event type t any function that assigns to every pair of event descriptions ed1, ed2 of type t a value in [0, 1]. Intuitively a coreference measure, provides an estimation of the plausibility for two event descriptions to refer to the same event.\nA coreference aggregation \u03b1t for event type t is a function that given two event descriptions, ed1, ed2 of type t returns a new joint event description ed1+2. A coreference aggregation provides a way to merge two event descriptions into a single event description that aggregates all the information contained in the starting event descriptions."}, {"heading": "5.3 Implementing coreference conditions rules", "text": "In our approach, rules for coreference measure and aggregation are formulated starting from the ontological definition of events.\nIn our first formulation for coreference rules we only considered the conditions for coreference measure: that is, in our experiments we are not interested in aggregating event descriptions but we only recognize and mark them as (possibly) coreferring.\nAs a first formulation for coreference measure, we simply provided rules for certain and possible coreference: the first conditions correspond to sufficient and necessary conditions (for each event type) for coreference existence, while the latter constitute only necessary conditions, providing an\nevidence for possible existence of coreference. Such conditions have been extracted from the ontological analysis of the considered event type: in other words, these coreference criteria correspond to necessary (and sometime sufficient) event identity criteria that result from that analysis.\nIn the formulation of the rules, we considered the availability of FrameNet frame elements data and the event type properties defined in the ontological analysis. These rules have then been implemented as SPARQL rules and used in the evaluation of our approach, as described in next section.\nThe complete set of rules can be found in Appendix B. In Table 2, for example, we report the conditions we identified for the event type Killing. In the table, each row represents one condition: E1 and E2 are variables identifying two Killing event instances and we use the dot notation to denote the value of their properties (viz. frame elements). With == we indicate equality of the values and with \u223c their compatibility (e.g. time value of E1 can be included of the time value for E2). The relation hasCoref indicates that the compared (sub-)events are themselves recognized as coreferring.\nWe remark that in this version of the rules we only considered \u201cintra-type\u201d coreference rules: this choice was made in order to compare with the existing coreference approaches in the evaluation. However, it is easy to extend the set of rules with conditions establishing coreference relations across events of different types. For example, considering Killing and Dying events, we can assert that they (certainly) describe the same happening if the victim is the same individual: we can write this condition as\n(E1.V ictim == E2.P rotagonist) & Killing(E1) & Dying(E2)"}, {"heading": "6 Evaluation on ECB benchmark", "text": "In this section, we evaluate the extraction of the coreference on the extended Event Coreference Bank corpus [3]. The dataset is a collection of 482 text documents from Google News, divided into 43 sets representing different topics. For each topic, the set of texts is annotated with intra- and cross-document event coreference, in accordance with the TimeML specification.\nIn literature, there are different ways to evaluate event coreference, each of them having different peculiarity: e.g., MUC [23], B3 [1], CEAF [14], and BLANC [15]. BLANC, in particular, was developed to overcome the limitations of the other previously proposed metrics, as it takes into consideration both coreference and non-coreference links, does not ignore singletons (problematic for MUC) and does not boost the score in their presence (as typically occurs for B3 and CEAF scores).\nTo compute these metrics, we relied on an already available package, CorScorer18, an open source tool that measure coreference sets w.r.t. the most important metrics used for this kind of evaluation.\n18 http://conll.github.io/reference-coreference-scorers/"}, {"heading": "6.1 Experiments setup", "text": "Unfortunately, not every event in the ECB corpus is annotated in the document, therefore we choose to consider, in our classification, only the words that are actually annotated in the gold standard.\nIn addition, as we are currently dealing with the most-frequent 6 event types, we filter out the lemmas that do not appear as lexical units in the corresponding frames in FrameNet. In particular, our evaluation is restricted to 137 different lemmas.\nWe develop a lemma-based baseline to be compared with the results obtained by our system: all predicates in FrameNet that have the same lemma are coreferential.\nWe processed the ECB corpus with Pikes, obtaining an RDF knowledge graph of the knowledge about events, entities, locations, etc., conveyed by the news documents in the corpus. We then applied the rules expressing coreference conditions on this RDF knowledge graph. The rules were implemented as SPARQL based rules, enriching the input knowledge graph with additional possibleCoref or certainCoref triples based on the condition expressed in the body. The rules were applied to the RDF data using RDFpro [7]."}, {"heading": "6.2 Experiments results", "text": "Results of our experiments are shown in Table 3. Besides the baseline, we report the performances of applying possible and certain event coreference rules separately, and altogether. A total of 152 possible event coreference pairs and 275 certain event coreference pairs were generated. On BLANC,\nour approach clearly outperforms the lemma baseline (approx. 27% difference on F1, considering both probable and certain coreference). On all metrics, our work consistently shows better precision scores than the baseline, while the contrary holds for recall. The good performances on precision should not surprise, as our rules get fired only when several conditions on the event description are met, and works also on events of the same type but expressed with different lemmas. On the contrary, the low performances on recall, especially compared with the baselines, are partly justified by the nature of the dataset considered in the evaluation: it consists of 43 different topics, and within each topic all documents mostly refer to the very same event, thus an approach based on matching lemma predicates it is likely to show good overall performances. However, in a general event extraction context, especially when dealing with event extraction from large news documents, such baseline approach will likely corefer very different event mentions just because they share the same predicate. In such context, precision-tuned approaches, as our work, tend to be more successful as they better cope with the noise and redundancy of information. As a final remark, our approach performs better when considering both certain and possible rules."}, {"heading": "7 Related work", "text": "Determining when two event descriptions in a text corpus are about the same event is a challenging, popular research stream. Several approaches have been proposed, and we summarize the main ones in this section. Approaches typically exploit the event arguments (e.g., action, participants, location, time) when comparing and clustering events descriptions (cfr. [24]).\nAmong them, some approaches [10,6] adopt models consisting of labeled training data. [10] proposed an ontology-based deterministic clustering algorithm to group event descriptions of certain type. [6] presented a learning-based classification algorithm exploiting event arguments and features.\nIn [3] an unsupervised Bayesian clustering model is proposed for within- and cross-document event coreference. It is based on the hierarchical Dirichlet process, and grounded on the assumption that two event descriptions corefer if they have the same event properties and share the same event participants.\n[12] presented an iterative approach, where entity coreference and event coreference are jointly performed, so that at each iteration, the intermediate results produced for one of the two tasks can be used in solving the other.\nIn [13] a supervised method for event coreference is proposed: the method exploits a rich feature set, and propagates information (alternatively) between events and their arguments.\nFinally, [9] considered granularity (e.g., durations of event actions, granularity level of locations) in computing event coreference. The authors present a supervised pairwise binary classifier based on decision-trees which computes the compatibility of event attributes (e.g., event trigger, time, location, human and non-human participants).\nNotwithstanding some attempts to use ontologies (e.g. [10]), none of the state-of-the-art approaches for within- and cross-document event coreference makes use of an ontological representation of events as presented in this paper.\nOn the other side, there is a long history of proposals for ontological definitions of events, for example inside DOLCE [4], conceptualization efforts as the Event Model F [21] or ontology design patterns19: in the context of Semantic Web data, some works considered reasoning with ontologically well founded definitions of events in a noisy and incomplete knowledge scenario like the case of (text extracted) news data. For instance, [16] introduces a formalization of composite events through a formal ontology called Ontology of Complex Events (OntoCE). This work aims at integrating complex event information from different media by managing incompatibilities across their contents. Such definition of events is then used to reason for checking temporal consistency of complex events, find new temporal relations and perform causal reasoning. On the other hand, in events extraction, ontological models (like the ESO ontology [22]) are generally used to structure and expose events objects and reasoning is only applied at a high level, assuming already clean and reconciled representations.\nOther works do not aim at a foundational characterization of event types, but concentrate on defining the properties of events in particular domains and (textual) resources. For example, [5] focus on characterizing text extracted events for RDF representation and reasoning over archeological procedures. Similarly, [20] outlines a project of an ontology-based framework to formally represent and extract historical domain events from archives in form of linked data: purpose of this extraction is to semi-automatically build narratives of complex events.\nIn the area of event representation, we may also cite works regarding Semantic Web enabled event stream reasoning: for example, [11] surveys the features of different approaches for analyzing streams of social media data to extract complex events. The authors, however, notice that the current approaches are limited by non-realistic assumptions of well-structured data, known streams and static ontologies. Current approaches lack support for temporal and spatial reasoning on complex events and usually do not support RDFS or OWL reasoning, restricting the possibilities to use background knowledge (thus including ontological definitions of events).\nAs noticed, the proposed approaches are usually interested in reasoning on high level (ontological) features and classification of events: in our work, our goal is to demonstrate that also \u201clow level\u201d processing tasks as event coreference can benefit from a well-founded characterization of events. Moreover, the contribution of our work does not reside in showing the benefits of using an event ontology for the execution of such tasks, but in the application of a prior ontological analysis of events types present in the resources."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we presented a method to derive coreference of text-extracted events on the base of a well-founded ontological analysis of events and their relations. We first provided a formal definition of event and presented a form of ontological analysis of event types.

Finally, we evaluated our approach and hypotheses over the ECB corpus:\n19 See, for example, http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:EventCore\nthe experiments show promising results encouraging us for further investigation in the direction of this initial work.\nIn this regard, we plan on extending the current work by considering a larger set of event types to be analyzed and the possiblity to apply our method to larger news datasets.
