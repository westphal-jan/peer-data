In this problem, each training example consists of one source and one target variable-length sequence, with no prior information regarding the alignments between the two. A model is trained to translate sequences in the\nsource language into corresponding sequences in the target. This framework has been successfully used in many different tasks, such as handwritten text generation (Graves, 2013), image description generation (Hodosh et al., 2013; Kiros et al., 2014; Mao et al., 2014; Elliott et al., 2015; Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2015; Vinyals et al., 2015), machine translation (Cho et al., 2014b; Sutskever et al., 2014) and video description generation (Donahue et al., 2015; Venugopalan et al., 2015).\nRecently, there has been an increase in the number of natural language generation models that explicitly use attention-based decoders, i.e. decoders that model an intra-sequential mapping between source and target representations. For instance, Xu et al. (2015) proposed an attentionbased model for the task of image description generation where the model learns to attend to specific parts of an image (the source) as it generates its description (the target). In MT, one can intuitively interpret this attention mechanism as inducing an alignment between source and target sentences, as first proposed by Bahdanau et al. (2015). The common idea is to explicitly frame a learning task in which the decoder learns to attend to the relevant parts of the source sequence when generating each part of the target sequence.\nWe are inspired by recent successes in using attention-based models in both image description generation and NMT. Our main goal in this work is to propose end-to-end multi-modal NMT models which effectively incorporate visual features in different parts of the attention-based NMT framework. The main contributions of our work are:\n\u2022 We propose novel attention-based multimodal NMT models which incorporate visual features into the encoder and the decoder.\n\u2022 We discuss the impact that adding synthetic multi-modal and multilingual data brings to\nar X\niv :1\n70 1.\n06 52\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n3 Ja\nn 20\n17\nmulti-modal NMT.\n\u2022 We show that images bring useful information to an NMT model and report state-ofthe-art results.\nOne additional contribution of our work is that we corroborate previous findings by Vinyals et al. (2015) that suggested that using image features directly as additional context to update the hidden state of the decoder (at each time step) leads to overfitting, ultimately preventing learning.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In \u00a71.1 we briefly discuss relevant previous related work. We then revise the attention-based NMT framework and further expand it into different multi-modal NMT models (\u00a72). In \u00a73 we introduce the data sets we use in our experiments. In \u00a74 we detail the hyperparameters, parameter initialisation and other relevant details of our models. Finally, in \u00a75 we draw conclusions and provide some avenues for future work."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related work", "text": "Attention-based encoder-decoder models for MT have been actively investigated in recent years. Some researchers have studied how to improve attention mechanisms (Luong et al., 2015; Tu et al., 2016) and how to train attention-based models to translate between many languages (Dong et al., 2015; Firat et al., 2016).\nThere has been some previous related work on using images in tasks involving multilingual and multi-modal natural language generation. Calixto et al. (2012) studied how the visual context of a textual description can be helpful in the disambiguation of Statistical MT (SMT) systems. Hitschler et al. (2016) used image features for re-ranking translations of image descriptions generated by an SMT model and reported significant improvements. Elliott et al. (2015) generated multilingual descriptions of images by learning and transferring features between two independent, non-attentive neural image description models. Luong et al. (2016) proposed a multi-task learning approach and incorporated neural image description as an auxiliary task to sequence-tosequence NMT and improved translations in the main translation task.\nMulti-modal MT has recently been addressed by the MT community in the form of a shared task (Specia et al., 2016). We note that in the of-\nficial results of this first shared task no submissions based on a purely neural architecture could improve on the phrase-based SMT (PBSMT) baseline. Nevertheless, researchers have proposed to include global visual features in re-ranking nbest lists generated by a PBSMT system or directly in a purely NMT framework with some success (Caglayan et al., 2016; Calixto et al., 2016; Libovicky\u0301 et al., 2016; Shah et al., 2016). The best results achieved by a purely NMT model in this shared task are those of Huang et al. (2016), who proposed to use global and regional image features extracted with the VGG19 network.\nSimilarly to one model we propose,1 they extract global features for an image, project these features into the vector space of the source words and then add it as a word in the input sequence. Their best model improves over a strong NMT baseline and is comparable to results obtained with a PBSMT model trained on the same data. For that reason, their models are used as baselines in our experiments. Next, we point out some key differences between their models and ours.\nArchitecture Their implementation is based on the attention-based model of Luong et al. (2015), which has some differences to that of Bahdanau et al. (2015), used in our work (\u00a72.1). Their encoder is a single-layer unidirectional LSTM and they use the last hidden state of the encoder to initialise the decoder\u2019s hidden state, therefore indirectly using the image features to do so. We use a bi-directional recurrent neural network (RNN) with GRU (Cho et al., 2014a) as our encoder, better encoding the semantics of the source sentence.\nImage features We include image features separately either as a word in the source sentence (\u00a72.2.1) or directly for encoder (\u00a72.2.2) or decoder initialisation (\u00a72.2.3), whereas Huang et al. (2016) only use it as a word. We also show it is better to include an image exclusively for the encoder or the decoder initialisation (Tables 1 and 2).\nData Huang et al. (2016) use object detections obtained with the RCNN of Girshick et al. (2014) as additional data, whereas we study the impact that additional back-translated data brings.\nPerformance All our models outperform Huang et al. (2016)\u2019s according to all metrics evaluated,\n1This idea has been developed independently by both research groups.\neven when they use additional object detections. If we use additional back-translated data, the difference becomes even larger."}, {"heading": "2 Attention-based NMT", "text": "In this section, we briefly revise the attentionbased NMT framework (\u00a72.1) and expand it into a multi-modal NMT framework (\u00a72.2)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Text-only attention-based NMT", "text": "We follow the notation of Bahdanau et al. (2015) and Firat et al. (2016) throughout this section. Given a source sequence X = (x1, x2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xN ) and its translation Y = (y1, y2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , yM ), an NMT model aims at building a single neural network that translates X into Y by directly learning to model p(Y |X). Each xi is a row index in a source lookup matrix Wx \u2208 R|Vx|\u00d7dx (the source word embeddings matrix) and each yj is an index in a target lookup matrix Wy \u2208 R|Vy |\u00d7dy (the target word embeddings matrix). Vx and Vy are source and target vocabularies and dx and dy are source and target word embeddings dimensionalities, respectively.\nA bidirectional RNN with GRU is used as the encoder. A forward RNN \u2212\u2192 \u03a6 enc reads X word by word, from left to right, and generates a sequence of forward annotation vectors ( \u2212\u2192 h 1, \u2212\u2192 h 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u2212\u2192 hN ) at each encoder time step i \u2208 [1, N ]. Similarly, a backward RNN \u2190\u2212 \u03a6 enc reads X from right to left, word by word, and generates a sequence of backward annotation vectors ( \u2190\u2212 h 1, \u2190\u2212 h 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n\u2190\u2212 hN ), as in (1):\u2212\u2192\nhi = \u2212\u2192 \u03a6 enc ( Wx[xi], \u2212\u2192 h i\u22121 ) , \u2190\u2212 hi = \u2190\u2212 \u03a6 enc ( Wx[xi], \u2190\u2212 h i+1 ) . (1)\nThe final annotation vector for a given time step i is the concatenation of forward and backward vectors hi = [\u2212\u2192 hi; \u2190\u2212 hi ] .\nIn other words, each source sequence X is encoded into a sequence of annotation vectors h = (h1,h2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,hN ), which are in turn used by the decoder: essentially a neural language model (LM) (Bengio et al., 2003) conditioned on the previously emitted words and the source sentence via an attention mechanism.\nAt each time step t of the decoder, we compute a time-dependent context vector ct based on the annotation vectors h, the decoder\u2019s previous hidden state st\u22121 and the target word y\u0303t\u22121 emitted by\nthe decoder in the previous time step.2\nWe follow Bahdanau et al. (2015) and use a single-layer feed-forward network to compute an expected alignment et,i between each source annotation vector hi and the target word to be emitted at the current time step t, as in (2):\net,i = va T tanh(Uast\u22121 +Wahi). (2) In Equation (3), these expected alignments are further normalised and converted into probabilities:\n\u03b1t,i = exp (et,i)\u2211N j=1 exp (et,j) , (3)\nwhere \u03b1t,i are called the model\u2019s attention weights, which are in turn used in computing the time-dependent context vector ct = \u2211N i=1\u03b1t,ihi. Finally, the context vector ct is used in computing the decoder\u2019s hidden state st for the current time step t, as shown in Equation (4):\nst = \u03a6dec(st\u22121,Wy[y\u0303t\u22121], ct), (4) where st\u22121 is the decoder\u2019s previous hidden state, Wy[y\u0303t\u22121] is the embedding of the word emitted in the previous time step, and ct is the updated timedependent context vector. In Figure 1 we illustrate the computation of the decoder\u2019s hidden state st.\nWe use a single-layer feed-forward neural network to initialise the decoder\u2019s hidden state s0 at time step t = 0 and feed it the concatenation of the last hidden states of the encoder\u2019s forward RNN\n2At training time, the correct previous target word yt\u22121 is known and therefore used instead of y\u0303t\u22121. At test or inference time, yt\u22121 is not known and y\u0303t\u22121 is used instead. Bengio et al. (2015) discussed problems that may arise from this difference between training and inference distributions.\n( \u2212\u2192 \u03a6 enc) and backward RNN ( \u2190\u2212 \u03a6 enc), as in (5): s0 = tanh ( Wdi[ \u2190\u2212 h 1; \u2212\u2192 hN ] + bdi ) , (5) where Wdi and bdi are model parameters. Since RNNs normally better store information about recent inputs in comparison to more distant ones (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Bahdanau et al., 2015), we expect to initialise the decoder\u2019s hidden state with a strong source sentence representation, i.e. a representation with a strong focus on both the first and the last tokens in the source sentence."}, {"heading": "2.2 Multi-modal NMT (MNMT)", "text": "Our models can be seen as expansions of the attention-based NMT framework described in \u00a72 with the addition of a visual component to incorporate image features.\nSimonyan and Zisserman (2014) trained and evaluated an extensive set of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models for classifying images into one out of the 1000 classes in ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015). We use their 19-layer VGG network (VGG19) to extract image feature vectors for all images in our dataset. We feed an image to the pre-trained VGG19 network and use the 4096D activations of the penultimate fully-connected layer FC73 as our image feature vector, henceforth referred to as q.\nWe propose three different methods to incorporate images into the attentive NMT framework: using an image as words in the source sentence (\u00a72.2.1), using an image to initialise the source language encoder (\u00a72.2.2) and the target language decoder (\u00a72.2.3).\nWe also evaluated a fourth mechanism to incorporate images into NMT, namely to use an image as one of the different contexts available to the decoder at each time step of the decoding process. We add the image features directly as an additional context, in addition to Wy[y\u0303t\u22121], st\u22121 and ct, to compute the hidden state st of the decoder at a given time step t. We corroborate previous findings by Vinyals et al. (2015) in that adding the image features as such causes the model to overfit, ultimately preventing learning.4\n3We use the activations of the FC7 layer, which encode information about the entire image, of the VGG19 network (configuration E) in Simonyan and Zisserman (2014)\u2019s paper.\n4For comparison, translations for the translated Multi30k test set (described in \u00a73) achieve just 3.8 BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), 15.5 METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2014) and 93.0 TER (Snover et al., 2006)."}, {"heading": "2.2.1 Images as source words: IMGW", "text": "One way we propose to incorporate images into the encoder is to project an image feature vector into the space of the words of the source sentence. We use the projected image as the first and/or last word of the source sentence and let the attention model learn when to attend to the image representation. Specifically, given the global image feature vector q \u2208 R4096, we compute (6): d = W 2I \u00b7 (W 1I \u00b7 q + b1I) + b2I , (6) whereW 1I \u2208 R4096\u00d74096 andW 2I \u2208 R4096\u00d7dx are image transformation matrices, b1I \u2208 R4096 and b2I \u2208 Rdx are bias vectors, and dx is the source words vector space dimensionality, all trained with the model. We then directly use d as words in the source words vector space: as the first word only (model IMG1W), and as the first and last words of the source sentence (model IMG2W).\nAn illustration of this idea is given in Figure 2, where a source sentence that originally contained N tokens, after including the image as source words will contain N + 1 tokens (model IMG1W) or N + 2 tokens (model IMG2W). In model IMG1W, the image is projected as the first source word only (solid line in Figure 2); in model IMG2W, it is projected into the source words space as both first and last words (both solid and dashed lines in Figure 2).\nGiven a source sequence X = (x1, x2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xN ), we concatenate the transformed image vector d to Wx[X] and apply the forward and backward encoder RNN passes, generating hidden vectors as in Figure 2. When computing the context vector ct (Equations (2) and (3)), we effectively make use of the transformed image vector, i.e. the \u03b1t,i attention weight parameters will use this information to attend or not to the image features.\nBy including images into the encoder in models IMG1W and IMG2W, our intuition is that (i) by including the image as the first word, we propagate image features into the source sentence vector representations when applying the forward RNN \u2212\u2192 \u03a6 enc (vectors \u2212\u2192 hi), and (ii) by including the image as the last word, we propagate image features into the source sentence vector representations when applying the backward RNN \u2190\u2212 \u03a6 enc (vectors \u2190\u2212 hi)."}, {"heading": "2.2.2 Images for encoder initialisation: IMGE", "text": "In the original attention-based NMT model described in \u00a72, the hidden state of the encoder is initialised with the zero vector #\u00bb 0 .

To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time a purely neural model significantly improves over a PBSMT model in all metrics on this data set.\nArguably, the main downside of applying multimodal NMT in a real-world scenario is the small amount of publicly available training data (\u223c30k), which restricts its applicability. For that reason, we back-translated the German sentences in the M30kC and created additional 145k synthetic triples (synthetic English sentence, original German sentence and image).\nIn Table 2, we present results for some of the models evaluated in Table 1 but when also trained on the additional data.

(2016) when trained on the same data.\n7Adding the synthetic sentence pairs to train the baseline PBSMT model, as we did with all neural MT models, deteriorated the results.\ncludes both precision and recall, and has a recall bias. That is also a noteworthy finding, since chrF3 is the only character-level metric we use, and it has shown a high correlation with human judgements (Stanojevic\u0301 et al., 2015).\nIn Table 3 we see translations for two entries in the test M30k set. In the first entry, although the reference translation is incorrect\u2014there is just one dog in the image\u2014, the multi-modal models translated it correctly. In the second entry, the last three multi-modal models extrapolate the reference+image and describe \u201cceremony\u201d as a \u201cwedding ceremony\u201d (IMG2W) and as an \u201cOlympics ceremony\u201d (IMGE and IMGD). This could be due to the fact that the training set is small, depicts a small variation of different scenes and contains different forms of biasses (van Miltenburg, 2015).\nWe note that the idea of using images as words in the source sentence, also entertained by Huang et al. (2016), does not perform as well as directly using the images in the encoder or decoder initialisation. The fact that multi-modal NMT models can benefit from back-translated data is also an interesting finding."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "We have introduced different ideas to incorporate images into state-of-the-art attention-based NMT, by using images as words in the source sentence, to initialise the encoder\u2019s hidden state and as additional data in the initialisation of the decoder\u2019s hidden state. We corroborate previous findings in that using image features directly at each time step of the decoder causes the model to overfit and prevents learning. The intuition behind our effort is to use global image feature vectors to visually ground translations and consequently increase translation quality. Extensive experiments show that adding global image features into attentionbased NMT is useful and improves over NMT and PBSMT as well as a strong multi-modal NMT baseline, according to all metrics evaluated.\nIn future work we will conduct a more systematic study on the impact that synthetic backtranslated data can have on multi-modal NMT, and also investigate how to incorporate local, spatialpreserving image features."}], "references": [{"title": "Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate", "author": ["Dzmitry Bahdanau", "Kyunghyun Cho", "Yoshua Bengio."], "venue": "International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2015.

In our experiments, we evaluate how these different strategies to incorporate global image features compare and which ones perform best. We also study the impact that adding synthetic multi-modal, multilingual data brings and find that the additional data have a positive impact on multi-modal models. We report new state-of-the-art results and our best models also significantly improve on a comparable phrase-based Statistical MT (PBSMT) model trained on the Multi30k data set according to all metrics evaluated. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time a purely neural model significantly improves over a PBSMT model on all metrics evaluated on this data set.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
