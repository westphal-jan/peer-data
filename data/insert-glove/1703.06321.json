Goddard, see (Goddard, 1919), the problem is to establish the optimal thrust profile for a rocket ascending vertically from the Earth\u2019s surface to achieve a given altitude with a given speed and pay load and with the minimum fuel expenditure. The aerodynamic drag and the gravitation varying with the altitude are considered. We study a problem version that assumes a bounded thrust. The problem has become a benchmark in the optimal control theory due to a characteristic singular arc behavior in connection with a relatively simple model structure, which makes the Goddard problem an ideal object of study, c.f.
