As for the latter, it was conjectured that representations may be disentangled by being flattened progressively and at a local scale (DiCarlo and Cox, 2007). An attempt at a formalization of the role of invariance in learning representations was made recently, being referred to as I-theory (Anselmi et al., 2013b). In this framework and using the language of differential geometry, we show that pooling over a group of transformations of the input contracts the metric and reduces its curvature, and provide quantitative bounds, in the aim of moving towards a theoretical understanding on how to disentangle representations.

Introduction", "text": "What does disentangling representations mean? In machine learning and neurosciences, representations being tangled has two principal interpretations, and they are intimately connected with each other. The first one is geometrical: consider two sheets of paper of different colors, place one of the two on top of the other, and crumple them together in a paper ball; now, it may look difficult to separate the two sheets with a third one: they are tangled, one color sheet representing one class of a classification problem. The second one is analytical: consider a dataset being parametrized by a set of coordinates {xi}i\u2208I , such as images parametrized by pixels, and a classification task between two classes of images. On the one hand, we cannot find a subset {xi}i\u2208J with J \u2282 I of this coordinate system such that a variation of these would not change the class of an element, while still spanning a reasonable amount of different images of this class. On the other hand, we are likely to be capable of finding a large amount of transformations preserving the class of any image of the dataset, without being expressible as linear transformations on this coordinate system, and this is another way to interpret representations or factors of variation as being tangled.\nWhy is disentangling representations important? On the physiological side, the brains of humans and primates alike have been observed to solve object recognition tasks by progressively disentangling their representations via the visual stream, from V1 to the IT cortex (DiCarlo and Cox, 2007; DiCarlo et al., 2012). On the side of deep learning, deep convolutional neural networks are also able to disentangle highly tangled representations, since a softmax \u2212 which, geometrically, performs essentially a linear separation \u2212 computed on the representation of their last hidden layer\nc\u00a9 2017 G. Be\u0301cigneul.\ncan yield very good accuracy (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). Conversely, disentangling representations might be sufficient to pre-solve practically any task relevant to the observed data (Bengio, 2013).\nHow can we design algorithms in order to move towards more disentangled representations? Although it was conjectured that the visual stream might disentangle representations by flattening them locally, thus inducing a decrease in the curvature globally (DiCarlo and Cox, 2007), the mechanisms underlying such a disentanglement, whether it be for the brain or deep learning architectures, remain very poorly understood (DiCarlo and Cox, 2007; Bengio, 2013). However, it is now of common belief that computing representations that are invariant with respect to irrelevant transformations of the input data can help. Indeed, on the one hand, deep convolutional networks have been noticed to naturally learn more invariant features with deeper layers (Goodfellow et al., 2009; Lenc and Vedaldi, 2015; Tensmeyer and Martinez, 2016). On the other hand, the V1 part of the brain similarly achieves invariance to translations and rotations via a \u201cpinwheels\u201d structure, which can be seen as a principal fiber bundle (Petitot, 2003; Poggio et al., 2012). Conversely, enforcing a higher degree of invariance with respect to not only translations, but also rotations, flips, and other groups of transformation has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in various machine learning tasks (Bruna and Mallat, 2013; Gens and Domingos, 2014; Oyallon and Mallat, 2015; Dieleman et al., 2016; Cohen and Welling, 2016a,b), and is believed to help in linearizing small diffeomorphisms (Mallat, 2016). To the best of our knowledge, the main theoretical efforts in this direction include the theory of scattering operators (Mallat, 2012; Wiatowski and Bo\u0308lcskei, 2015) as well as I-theory (Anselmi et al., 2013b,a; Anselmi and Poggio, 2014; Anselmi et al., 2016). In particular, I-theory permits to use the whole apparatus of kernel theory to build invariant features (Mroueh et al., 2015; Raj et al., 2016).\nOur work builds a bridge between the idea that disentangling is a result of (i) a local decrease in the curvature of the representations, and (ii) building representations that are invariant to nuisance deformations, by proving that pooling over such groups of transformations results in a local decreasing of the curvature.\nWe start by providing some background material, after which we introduce our formal framework and theorems, which we then discuss in the case of the non-commutative group generated by translations and rotations."}, {"heading": "2. Some background material", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1. Groups and geometry", "text": "A group is a set G together with a map \u00b7 : G\u00d7G \u2192 G such that: (i) \u2200g, g\u2032, g\u2032\u2032 \u2208 G, g \u00b7 (g\u2032 \u00b7 g\u2032\u2032) = (g \u00b7 g\u2032) \u00b7 g\u2032\u2032, (ii) \u2203e \u2208 G, \u2200g \u2208 G, g \u00b7 e = e \u00b7 g = g, (iii) \u2200g \u2208 G, \u2203g\u22121 \u2208 G : g \u00b7 g\u22121 = g\u22121 \u00b7 g = e, where e is called the identity element. We write gg\u2032 instead of g \u00b7 g\u2032 for simplicity. If, moreover, gg\u2032 = g\u2032g for all g, g\u2032 \u2208 G, then G is said to be commutative or abelian.\nA subgroup of G is a set H \u2282 G such that for all h, h\u2032 \u2208 H , hh\u2032 \u2208 H and h\u22121 \u2208 H . A subgroup H of a group G is said to be normal in G if for all g \u2208 G, gH = Hg, or equivalently, for all g \u2208 G and h \u2208 H , ghg\u22121 \u2208 H . If G is abelian, then all of its subgroups are normal in G.\nA Lie group is a group which is also a smooth manifold, and such that its product law and inverse map are smooth with respect to its manifold structure. A Lie group is said to be locally compact if each of its element possesses a compact neighborhood. On every locally compact Lie group, one can define a Haar measure, which is a left-invariant, non-trivial Lebesgue measure on its Borel algebra, and is uniquely defined up to a positive scaling constant. If this Haar measure is also right-invariant, then the group is said to be unimodular. This Haar measure is always finite on compact sets, and strictly positive on non-empty open sets. Examples of unimodular Lie groups include in particular all abelian groups, compact groups, semi-simple Lie groups and connected nilpotent Lie groups.\nA group G is said to be acting on a set X if we have a map \u00b7 : G \u00d7 X \u2192 X such that for all g, g\u2032 \u2208 G, for all x \u2208 X, g \u00b7 (g\u2032 \u00b7 x) = (gg\u2032) \u00b7 x and e \u00b7 x = x. If this map is also smooth, then we say that G is smoothly acting on X. We write gx instead of g \u00b7 x for simplicity. Then, the group orbit of x \u2208 X under the action of G is defined by G \u00b7 x = {gx | g \u2208 G}, and the stabilizer of x by Gx = {g \u2208 G | gx = x}. Note that Gx is always a subgroup of G, and that for all x, y \u2208 X, we have either (G \u00b7x)\u2229 (G \u00b7y) = \u2205, orG \u00b7x = G \u00b7y. Hence, we can writeX as the disjoint union of its group orbits, i.e. there exists a minimal subset X\u0303 \u2282 X such that X = \u2294x\u2208X\u0303G \u00b7 x. The set of orbits ofX under the action ofG is writtenX/G, and is in one-to-one correspondence with X\u0303. Moreover, note that ifH is a subgroup ofG, thenH is naturally acting on G via (h, g) \u2208 H\u00d7G 7\u2192 hg \u2208 G; if we further assume that H is normal in G, then one can define a canonical group structure on G/H , thus turning the canonical projection g \u2208 G 7\u2192 H \u00b7 g into a group morphism.\nA diffeomorphism between two manifolds is a map that is smooth, bijective and has a smooth inverse. A group morphism between two groups G and G\u2032 is a map \u03d5 : G \u2192 G\u2032 such that for all g1, g2 \u2208 G, \u03d5(g1g2) = \u03d5(g1)\u03d5(g2). A group isomorphism is a bijective group morphism, and a Lie group isomorphism is a group isomorphism that is also a diffeomorphism.\nThe Lie algebra g of a Lie group G is its tangent space at e, and is endorsed with a bilinear map [\u00b7, \u00b7] : g \u00d7 g \u2192 g called its Lie bracket, and such that for all x, y, z \u2208 g, [x, y] = \u2212[y, x] and [x, [y, z]] + [y, [z, x]] + [z, [x, y]] = 0. Moreover, there is a bijection between g and left-invariant vector fields on G, defined by \u03be \u2208 g 7\u2192 {g \u2208 G 7\u2192 deLg(\u03be)}, where Lg(h) = gh is the left translation. Finally, the flow t 7\u2192 \u03c6t of such a left-invariant vector fieldX\u03be is given by \u03c6t(g) = g exp(t\u03be), where exp : g \u2192 G is the exponential map on G.\nFor more on Lie groups, Lie algebras, Lie brackets and group representations, see Kirillov (2008), and for a rapid and clear presentation of the notions of sectional curvature and Riemannian curvature, see Andrews and Hopper (2010).\n2.2. I-theory\nI-theory aims at understanding how to compute a representation of an image I that is both unique and invariant under some deformations of a groupG, and how to build such representations in a hierarchical way (Poggio et al., 2012; Anselmi et al., 2013b,a; Anselmi and Poggio, 2014; Anselmi et al., 2016).\nSuppose that we are given a Hilbert space X , typically L2(R2), representing the space of images. LetG be a locally compact group acting on X . Then, note that the group orbit G \u00b7I constitutes such an invariant and unique representation of I , as G \u00b7 I = G \u00b7 (gI), for all g \u2208 G, and since two group orbits intersecting each other are equal.\nBut how can we compare such group orbits? For an image I \u2208 X , define the map \u0398I : g \u2208 G 7\u2192 gI \u2208 X and the probability distribution PI(A) = \u00b5G(\u0398\u22121I (A)) for any borel set A of X , where \u00b5G is the Haar measure on G. For I, I\n\u2032 \u2208 X , write I \u223c I \u2032 is there exists g \u2208 G such that I = gI \u2032. Then, one can prove that I \u223c I \u2032 if and only if PI = PI\u2032 . Hence, we could compare G \u00b7 I andG\u00b7I \u2032 by comparing PI and PI\u2032 . However, computing PI can be difficult, so one must be looking for ways to approximate PI . If t \u2208 S(L2(R2)), define P\u3008I,t\u3009 to be the distribution associated with the random variable g 7\u2192 \u3008gI, t\u3009. One can then prove that PI = PI\u2032 if and only if P\u3008I,t\u3009 = P\u3008I\u2032,t\u3009 for all t \u2208 S(L2(R2)), and then provide a lower bound on the sufficient numberK of such templates tk, 1 6 k 6 K , drawn uniformly on S(L2(R2)), in order to recover the information of PI up to some error \u03b5 and with high probability 1\u2212 \u03b4. Finally, each P\u3008I,tk\u3009 can be approximated by a histogram\nhkn(I) = 1 |G| \u2211\ng\u2208G\n\u03b7n(\u3008gI, tk\u3009),\nif G is finite or\nhkn(I) = 1\n\u00b5G(G)\n\u222b\ng\u2208G \u03b7n(\u3008gI, tk\u3009)d\u00b5G(g),\nif G is compact, where \u03b7n are various non-negative and possibly non-linear functions, 1 6 n 6 N , such as sigmoid, ReLU, modulus, hyperbolic tangent or x 7\u2192 |x|p, among others.\nIn the case where the group G is only partially observable (for instance if G is only locally compact but not bounded), one can define instead a \u201cpartially invariant representation\u201d, replacing each hkn(I) by 1\n\u00b5G(G0)\n\u222b\ng\u2208G0\n\u03b7n(\u3008gI, tk\u3009)d\u00b5G(g),\nwhere G0 is a compact subset of G which can be observed in practice. Under some \u201clocalization condition\u201d (see (Anselmi et al., 2013b)), it can be proved that this representation is invariant under deformations by elements of G0. When this localization condition is not met, we do not have any exact invariance a priori, but one might expect that the variation in directions defined by the symmetries of G0 is going to be reduced.\nFor instance, let G be the group R2 of translations in the plane, G0 = [\u2212a, a]2 for some a > 0, \u03b7 : x 7\u2192 (\u03c3(x))2 where \u03c3 is a point-wise non-linearity commonly used in neural networks, and tk \u2208 S(L2(R2)) for 1 6 k 6 K . Then, note that the quantities\n\u221a |G0|hk(I) = \u221a \u2211\ng\u2208G0\n\u03b7(\u3008gI, tk\u3009),\nfor 1 6 k 6 K are actually computed by a 1-layer convolutional neural network with filters (tk)16k6K , non-linearity \u03c3 and L 2-pooling. Moreover, the family ( \u221a |G0|hk(gI))g\u2208G is exactly\nthe output of this convolutional layer, thus describing a direct correspondence between pooling and locally averaging over a group of transformations.\nAnother correspondence can be made between this framework and deep learning architectures. Indeed, assume that during learning, the set of filters of a layer of a convolutional neural network becomes stable under the action of some unknown group G acting on the pixel space, and denote by \u03c3 the point-wise non-linearity computed by the network. Moreover, suppose that the convolutional layer and point-wise non-linearity are followed by an Lp-pooling, defined by \u03a0p\u03c6(I)(x) = ( \u222b y\u2208R2 |I(y)1[0,a]2(x \u2212 y)|p dy )1/p . Then, observe that the convolutional layer outputs the following feature maps:\n{\u03a0p\u03c6(\u03c3(I \u22c6 tk))}16k6K .\nBesides, if the groupG has a unitary representation, and if its action preserves R2, then for all g \u2208 G and 1 6 k 6 K , we have\n\u03a0p\u03c6(\u03c3(gI \u22c6 tk)) = \u03a0 p \u03c6(\u03c3(g(I \u22c6 g \u22121tk))) = g\u03a0 p \u03c6(\u03c3(I \u22c6 g \u22121tk)).\nThen, the following layer of the convolutional network is going to compute the sum across channels k of these different signals. However, if our set of filters tk can be written as G0 \u00b7 t for some filter t and a subpart G0 of G, then this sum will be closely related to a histogram as in I-theory:\n\u2211\ng\u2208G0\n\u03a0p\u03c6(\u03c3(I \u22c6 gt)) = \u2211\ng\u2208G0\ng\u03a0p\u03c6(\u03c3(g \u22121I \u22c6 tk)).\nIn other words, (local) group invariances are free to appear during learning among filters of a convolutional neural network, and will naturally be pooled over by the next layer. For more on this, see (Bruna et al., 2013; Mallat, 2016).\nFinally, let\u2019s mention that this implicit pooling over symmetries can also be computed explicitly, and such group invariances across filters enforced, if we know the group in advance, as in G-CNNs and steerable CNNs (Cohen and Welling, 2016a,b)."}, {"heading": "3. Main results: formal framework and theorems", "text": "Let G be a finite-dimensional, locally compact and unimodular Lie group smoothly acting on R2. This defines an action (Lgf)(x) = f(g\n\u22121x) on L2(R2).

Note that, as one could have expected, this result doesn\u2019t depend on the scaling constant of the Haar measure. Intuitively, this result formalizes the idea that locally averaging with respect to some factors of variation, or coordinates, will reduce the variation with respect to those coordinates. The following drawings illustrate the intuition behind Theorem 1, where we pass from left to right by applying \u03a6.\nNote that the quantity \u00b5G((G0g)\u2206G0)\n\u00b5G(G0) , depending on the geometry of the group, is likely to de-\ncrease when we increase the size of G0: if G = R 2 is the translation group, G0 = [0, a] 2 for some a > 0, and g\u03b5 is the translation by the vector (\u03b5, \u03b5), then \u00b5G is just the usual Lebesgue measure in R 2 and\n\u00b5G((G0g\u03b5)\u2206G0)\n\u00b5G(G0) \u223c \u03b5\u21920 2 2a\u03b5 a2 = 4\u03b5 \u221a \u00b5G(G0) .\nIndeed, locally averaging over a wider area will decrease the variation even more.\nAs images are handily represented by functions from the space of pixels R2 to either R or C, let us define our dataset X to be a finite-dimensional manifold embedded in a bigger space of functions Y . As for technical reasons we will need our functions to be L2, smooth, and with a gradient having a fast decay at infinity, we choose Y to be the set of functions f \u2208 L2(R2) \u2229 C\u221e(R2) such that |\u3008\u2207f(x), x\u3009| = Ox\u2192\u221e( 1\u2016x\u20161+\u03b5 ), for some fixed small \u03b5 > 0. Note that in practice, images are only non-zero on a compact domain, therefore these assumptions are not restrictive.\nFurther assume that for all f \u2208 X , for all g \u2208 G, Lgf \u2208 X . Intuitively, X is our manifold of images, and G corresponds to the group of transformations that are not relevant to the task at hand. Recall that from I-theory, the orbit of an image f under G constitutes a good unique and invariant\nrepresentation. Here, we are interested in comparing G \u00b7f and \u03a6(G \u00b7f), i.e. before and after locally averaging.\nBut how can we compute a bound on the curvature of \u03a6(G \u00b7 f)? It is well known that in a Lie group endorsed with a bi-invariant pseudo-Riemannian metric \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009, the Riemann curvature tensor is given by\nR(X,Y,Z,W ) = \u22121 4 \u3008[X,Y ], [Z,W ]\u3009,\nwhere X,Y,Z,W are left-invariant vector-fields, and hence if (X,Y ) forms an orthonormal basis of the plane they span, then the sectional curvature is given by\n\u03ba(X \u2227 Y ) = R(X,Y, Y,X) = 1 4 \u3008[X,Y ], [X,Y ]\u3009.\nTherefore, would we be able to define a Lie group structure and a bi-invariant pseudo-Riemannian\nmetric on \u03a6(G \u00b7f), we could use this formula to compute its curvature. First, we are going to define a Lie group structure on G \u00b7 f , which we will then transport on \u03a6(G \u00b7 f). As a Lie group structure is made of a smooth manifold structure and a compatible group structure, we need to construct both. In order to obtain the group structure on the orbit, let\u2019s assume that the stabilizer Gf is normal; a condition that is met for instance if G is abelian, or if this subgroup is trivial, meaning that f does not have internal symmetries corresponding to those of G, which is only a technical condition, as it can be enforced in practice by slightly deforming f , by breaking the relevant symmetries with a small noise. Besides, in order to obtain a smooth manifold structure on the orbits, we need to assume that Gf is an embedded Lie subgroup of G, which, from proposition B.0 (see appendix), is met automatically when this group admits a finite-dimensional representation.\nThen, from proposition B.1, there is one and only one manifold structure on the topological quotient space G/Gf turning the canonical projection \u03c0 : G \u2192 G/Gf into a smooth submersion; moreover, the action of G on G/Gf is smooth, G/Gf is a Lie group, \u03c0 is a Lie group morphism, the Lie algebra gf of Gf is an ideal of the Lie algebra g of G and the linear map from TeG/TeGf to TeGf (G/Gf ) induced by Te\u03c0 is a Lie algebra isomorphism from g/gf to the Lie algebra of G/Gf .\nFinally, we need a geometrical assumption on the orbits, insuring that G is warped on G \u00b7 f in a way that is not \u201cfractal\u201d, i.e. that this orbit can be given a smooth manifold structure: assume that G \u00b7 f is locally closed in X . Using this assumption and proposition B.2, the canonical map \u0398f : G/Gf \u2192 X defined by \u0398f (gGf ) = Lgf is a one-to-one immersion, whose image is the orbit G \u00b7f , which is a submanifold of X ; moreover, \u0398f is a diffeomorphism fromG/Gf toG \u00b7f . Further notice that \u0398f is G-equivariant, i.e. for all g, g \u2032 \u2208 G,\n\u0398f (g(g \u2032Gf )) = Lgg \u2032f = LgLg\u2032f = Lg\u0398f (g \u2032Gf ).\nMoreover, we can define on G \u00b7 f a group law by\n(Lg1f) \u00b7 (Lg2f) := Lg1g2f,\nfor g1, g2 \u2208 G. Indeed, let\u2019s prove that this definition doesn\u2019t depend on the choice of g1, g2. Assume that gi = aibi for ai \u2208 G and bi \u2208 Gf , i \u2208 {1, 2}. Then, as Gf is normal in G, there exists\nb\u20321 \u2208 Gf such that b1a2 = a2b\u20321. Then g1g2 = a1a2b\u20321b2 and hence Lg1g2f = La1a2f , and this group law is well-defined. Now that G \u00b7 f is a group, observe that \u0398f is a group isomorphism from G/Gf to G \u00b7 f . Indeed, it is bijective since it is a diffeomorphism, and it is a group morphism as\n\u0398f ((gGf )(g \u2032Gf )) = \u0398f ((gg \u2032)Gf ) = Lgg\u2032f = (Lgf) \u00b7 (Lg\u2032f) = \u0398f (gGf ) \u00b7\u0398f (g\u2032Gf ).\nHence, G \u00b7f is also a Lie group, since G/Gf is a Lie group and\u0398f : G/Gf \u2192 G \u00b7f is a diffeomorphism. Moreover, Lie(G \u00b7 f) is isomorphic to g/gf as a Lie algebra, since they are isomorphic as vector spaces (\u0398f being an immersion), and by the fact that the pushforward of a diffeomorphism always preserves the Lie bracket.\nNow that we have defined a Lie group structure on G \u00b7 f , how can we obtain one on \u03a6(G \u00b7 f)? Suppose that \u03a6 is injective on G \u00b7 f and on Lie(G \u00b7 f). We can thus define a group law on \u03a6(G \u00b7 f) by: \u2200g1, g2 \u2208 G/Gf , \u03a6(Lg1f) \u00b7 \u03a6(Lg2f) := \u03a6(Lg1g2f). As the inverse function theorem tells us that \u03a6 is a diffeomorphism from G \u00b7 f onto its image, \u03a6(G \u00b7 f) is now endorsed with a Lie group structure. However, in order to carry out the relevant calculations, we still need to define left-invariant vector-fields on our Lie group orbits.\nFor all \u03be \u2208 g, define the following left-invariant vector-fields respectively on G \u00b7f and \u03a6(G \u00b7f):\nX\u03be : Lgf 7\u2192 d\ndt |t=0 (LgLexp(t\u03be)f),\nX\u0303\u03be : \u03a6(Lgf) 7\u2192 d\ndt |t=0 \u03a6(LgLexp(t\u03be)f).\nWe can now state the following theorem:\nTheorem 2. For all f \u2208 X , for all \u03be, \u03be\u2032 \u2208 g,\n\u2016[X\u0303\u03be , X\u0303\u03be\u2032 ]\u03a6(f)\u201622 6 \u03bb [ d\nds |s=0\n\u00b5G((G0 exp(s[\u03be, \u03be \u2032]))\u2206G0)\n\u00b5G(G0)\n]2\u2016f\u201622.\nProof: See Appendix A.\nAs X is a manifold embedded in L2(R2), it inherits a Riemannian metric by projection of the usual inner-product of L2(R2) on the tangent bundle of X . Moreover, if we further assume that for all g \u2208 G, |Jg| = 1, then this Riemannian metric is bi-invariant, and we can finally use the above formula on the Riemannian curvature, together with the previous inequality, to compute a bound on the curvature in a Lie group endorsed with an bi-invariant metric:"}, {"heading": "Corollary.", "text": "For all f \u2208 X , for all \u03be, \u03be\u2032 \u2208 g,\n0 6 R\u03a6(f)(X\u0303\u03be, X\u0303\u03be\u2032 , X\u0303\u03be\u2032 , X\u0303\u03be) 6 [1\n2\nd\nds |s=0\n\u00b5G((G0 exp(s[\u03be, \u03be \u2032]))\u2206G0)\n\u00b5G(G0)\n]2\u2016f\u201622.\nAnd if (X\u0303\u03be , X\u0303\u03be\u2032) forms an orthonormal basis of the plane they span in Lie(\u03a6(G \u00b7 f)) = \u03a6(Lie(G \u00b7 f)), then:\n0 6 \u03ba\u03a6(f)(X\u0303\u03be \u2227 X\u0303\u03be\u2032) 6 [1\n2\nd\nds |s=0\n\u00b5G((G0 exp(s[\u03be, \u03be \u2032]))\u2206G0)\n\u00b5G(G0)\n]2\u2016f\u201622.\nRemark. The sectional curvature of the basis (X\u0303\u03be, X\u0303\u03be\u2032) at \u03a6(f) is also the Gaussian curvature of the two-dimensional surface swept out by small geodesics induced by linear combinations of X\u0303\u03be(\u03a6(f)) and X\u0303\u03be\u2032(\u03a6(f)).\nAmong well-known finite-dimensional, locally compact and unimodular Lie group smoothly acting on R2, there are the group R2 of translations, the compact groups O(2) and SO(2), the euclidean group E(2), as well as transvections, or shears. Moreover, another class of suitable unimodular Lie groups is given by the one-dimensional flows of Hamiltonian systems, which, as deformations of images, could be interpreted as the smooth evolutions of the screen in a video over time, provided that these evolutions can be expressed as group actions on the pixel space.\nFinally, let\u2019s see what Theorem 2 gives us in the case G = R2 \u22c9 SO(2). Note that this group is not commutative, and its curvature form is not identically zero. Let \u03b8 \u2208 (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0), a > 0, and G0 = [\u2212\u03b8, \u03b8]\u00d7 [0, a]2. A representation of this group is given by matrices of the form\ng(\u03b8, x, y) =\n\n cos(\u03b8) \u2212 sin(\u03b8) x sin(\u03b8) cos(\u03b8) y\n0 0 1\n\n ,\nand a representation of its Lie algebra is given by\n\u03be(\u03b6, x, y) =\n\n 0 \u2212\u03b6 x \u03b6 0 y 0 0 0\n\n .\nThe Lie bracket is then given by\n[\u03be(\u03b6, x, y), \u03be(\u03b6 \u2032, x\u2032, y\u2032)] = \u03be(\u03b6, x, y)\u03be(\u03b6 \u2032, x\u2032, y\u2032)\u2212\u03be(\u03b6 \u2032, x\u2032, y\u2032)\u03be(\u03b6, x, y) = \u03be(0, \u03b6 \u2032y\u2212\u03b6y\u2032, \u03b6x\u2032\u2212\u03b6 \u2032x).\nAs the exponential map on the group of translations is the identity map, and as the Haar measure on R 2 \u22c9 SO(2) is just the product of the Haar measures on R2 and SO(2), we have\n\u00b5G((G0 exp(s[\u03be(\u03b6, x, y), \u03be(\u03b6 \u2032, x\u2032, y\u2032]))\u2206G0) =\n2\u03b8\u00b5R2(([s(\u03b6 \u2032y \u2212 \u03b6y\u2032), s(\u03b6 \u2032y \u2212 \u03b6y\u2032) + a]\u00d7 [s(\u03b6x\u2032 \u2212 \u03b6 \u2032x), s(\u03b6x\u2032 \u2212 \u03b6 \u2032x) + a])\u2206[0, a]2),\nand \u00b5G(G0) = 2\u03b8a 2.

Conclusion", "text": "Being able to disentangle highly tangled representations is a very important and challenging problem in machine learning. In deep learning in particular, there exist successful algorithms that may disentangle highly tangled representations in some situtations, without us understanding why. Similarly, the ventral stream of the visual cortex in humans and primates seems to perform such a disentanglement of representations, but, again, the reasons behind this process are difficult to understand. It is believed that making representations invariant to some nuisance deformations, as well as locally flattening them, might help or even be an essential part of the disentangling process. As shown by our theorems, there is a connection between these two intuitions, in the sense that achieving a higher degree of invariance with respect to some group transformations will flatten the representations in directions of the tangent space corresponding to the Lie algebra generators of these transformations. Using our theorems, we showed that in the case of the group of positive affine isometries, a precise bound on the sectional curvature can be computed, with respect to the pooling parameters. We hope that this work will encourage the geometrical study of how representations evolve during learning, in function of the hyperparameters of the algorithm that is used on these representations."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank Simon Janin and Victor Godet for interesting conversations."}, {"heading": "Appendix A.

An attempt at a formalization of the role of invariance in learning representations was made recently, being referred to as I-theory (Anselmi et al., 2013b). In this framework and using the language of differential geometry, we show that pooling over a group of transformations of the input contracts the metric and reduces its curvature, and provide quantitative bounds, in the aim of moving towards a theoretical understanding on how to disentangle representations.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
