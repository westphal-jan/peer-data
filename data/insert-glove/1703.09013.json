Traditional RE systems have concentrated on identifying and extracting relations of interest by taking as input the target relations, along with hand-crafted extraction patterns or patterns learned from hand-labeled training examples. Consequently, shifting to a new domain requires to first specify the target relations and then to manually create new extraction rules or to annotate new training examples by hand (Banko and Etzioni, 2008). As this manual labor scales linearly with the number of target relations, this supervised approach does not scale to large, heterogeneous corpora which are likely to contain a variety of unanticipated relations (Schmidek and Barbosa, 2014). To tackle this issue, Banko and Etzioni (2008) introduced a new extraction paradigm named \u2019Open RE\u2019 that facilitates domain-independent discovery of relations extracted from text by not depending on any relation-specific human input. Generally, state-of-the-art Open RE systems identify relationships between entities in a sentence by matching patterns over either its POS tags, e. g. (Banko et al., 2007; Fader et al., 2011; Merhav et al., 2012), or its dependency tree, e. g. (Nakashole et al., 2012; Mausam et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2013; Mesquita et al., 2013). However, particularly in long and syntactically complex sentences, relevant relations often span several clauses or are presented in a non-canonical form (Angeli et al., 2015), thus posing a challenge for current Open RE approaches which are prone to make incorrect extractions - while missing others - when operating on sentences with an intricate structure. To achieve a higher accuracy on Open RE tasks, we have developed a framework for simplifying the linguistic structure of NL sentences. It identifies components of a sentence which usually provide supplementary information that may be easily extracted without losing essential information. By applying a set of hand-crafted grammar rules that have been defined in the course of a rule engineering process based on linguistic features, these constituents are then disembedded and transformed into self-contained simpler context sentences. In this way, sentences that present a complex syntax are converted into a set of more concise sentences that are easier to process for subsequently applied Open RE systems, while still expressing the original meaning.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

However, unlike recent approaches in the field of extractive sentence compression, we do not delete these constituents, which would result in a loss of background information, but rather aim at preserving the full informational content of the original sentence. Thus, on the basis of syntax-driven heuristics, components which typically provide mere secondary information are identified and transformed into simpler stand-alone context sentences with the help of paraphrasing operations adopted from the text simplification area.\nDefinition of the Simplification Rules By analyzing the structure of hundreds of sample sentences from the English Wikipedia, we have determined constituents that commonly supply no more than contextual background information. These components comprise the following syntactic elements:\n\u2022 non-restrictive relative clauses (e. g. \u201dThe city\u2019s top tourist attraction was the Notre Dame Cathedral, which welcomed 14 million visitors in 2013.\u201d)\n\u2022 non-restrictive (e. g. \u201dHe plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school\u2019s varsity team.\u201d) and restrictive appositive phrases (e. g. \u201dHe met with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.\u201d)\n\u2022 participial phrases offset by commas (e. g. \u201dThe deal, titled Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, saw the removal of sanctions.\u201d)\n\u2022 adjective and adverb phrases delimited by punctuation (e. g. \u201dOverall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9 percent in 2010.\u201d)\n\u2022 particular prepositional phrases (e. g. \u201dIn 2012, Time magazine named Obama as its Person of the Year.\u201d)\n\u2022 lead noun phrases (e. g. \u201dSix weeks later, Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination.\u201d)\n\u2022 intra-sentential attributions (e. g. \u201dHe said that both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples.\u201d)\n\u2022 parentheticals (e. g. \u201dHe signed the reauthorization of the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).\u201d)\nBesides, both conjoined clauses presenting specific features and sentences incorporating particular punctuation are disconnected into separate ones. After having thus identified syntactic phenomena that generally require simplification, we have determined the characteristics of those constituents, using a number of syntactic features (constituency-based parse trees as well as POS tags) that have occasionally been enhanced with the semantic feature of NE tag. For computing them, a number of software tools provided by the Stanford CoreNLP framework have been employed (Stanford Parser, Stanford POS Tagger and Stanford Named Entity Recognizer).1 Based upon these properties, we have then specified a set of hand-crafted grammar rules for carrying out the syntactic simplification operations which are applied one after another on the given input sentence. In that way, linguistically peripheral material is disembedded, thus producing a more concise core sentence which is augmented by a number of related self-contained contextual sentences (see the example displayed in figure 1).\n1http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/\nAlgorithm 1 Syntax-based sentence simplification Input: sentence s 1: repeat 2: r \u2190 next rule \u2208 R # Null if no more rules 3: if r is applicable to s then 4: C, P \u2190 apply rextract to s # Identify the set of constituents C to extract from s, and their positions P in s 5: for all constituents c \u2208 C do 6: context\u2190 apply rparaphrase to c # Produce a context sentence 7: contextSet\u2190 add context # Add it to the core\u2019s set of associated context sentences 8: until R = \u2205 9: core\u2190 delete tokens in s at positions p \u2208 P # Reduce the input to its core 10: return core and contextSet # Output the core and its context sentences\nApplication of the Simplification Operations The simplification rules we have specified are applied one after another to the source sentence, following a three-stage approach (see algorithm 1). First, clauses or phrases that are to be separated out - including their respective antecedent, where required - have to be identified by pattern matching. In case of success, a context sentence is constructed by\neither linking the extractable component to its antecedent or by inserting a complementary constituent that is required in order to make it a full sentence. Finally, the main sentence has to be reduced by dropping the clause or phrase, respectively, that has been transformed into a stand-alone context sentence. In this way, a complex source sentence is transformed into a simplified two-layered representation in the form of core facts and accompanying contexts, thus providing a kind of normalization of the input text. Accordingly, when carrying out the task of extracting semantic relations between entities on the reduced core sentences, the complexity of determining intricate predicate-argument structures with variable arity and nested structures from syntactically complex input sentences is removed. Beyond that, the phrases of the original sentence that convey no more than peripheral information are converted into independent sentences which, too, can be more easily extracted under a binary or ternary predicateargument structure (see the example illustrated in figure 1).\n3 Evaluation\nThe results of an experimental evaluation show that state-of-the-art Open RE approaches obtain a higher accuracy and lower information loss when operating on sentences that have been pre-processed by our simplification framework. In par-\nticular when dealing with sentences that contain nested structures, Open RE systems benefit from a prior simplification step (see figures 2 and 3 for an example). The full evaluation methodology and detailed results are reported in Niklaus et al. (2016)."}, {"heading": "4 Usage", "text": "The text simplification framework is publicly available2 as both a library and a command line tool whose workflow is depicted in figure 1. It takes as input NL text in the form of either a single sentence or a file with line separated sentences. As described above, each input sentence is first transformed into a structurally simplified version consisting of 1 to n core sentences and 0 to m associated context sentences. In a second step, the relations contained in the input are extracted by applying the Open IE system3 upon the simplified sentences. Finally, the results generated in this way are written to the console or a specified output file in JSON format. As an example, the outcome produced by our simplification system when applied to a full Wikipedia article is provided online.4"}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We have described a syntax-driven rule-based text simplification framework that simplifies the linguistic structure of input sentences with the objective of improving the coverage of state-of-the-art Open RE systems.
