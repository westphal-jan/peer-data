Cognates detection is the task of identifying words across languages that have a common origin. Automatic cognates detection is important to linguists because cognates are needed to determine how languages evolved. Cognates are used for protolanguage reconstruction (Hall and Klein, 2011; Bouchard-Co\u0302te\u0301 et al., 2013). Cognates are important for cross-language dictionary look-up and can also improve the quality of machine translation, word alignment, and bilingual lexicon induction (Simard et al., 1993; Kondrak et al., 2003).\nA word is traditionally only considered cognate with another if both words proceed from the same ancestor. Nonetheless, in line with the conventions of previous research in computational lin-\nguistics, we set a broader definition. We use the word \u2018cognate\u2019 to denote, as in (Kondrak, 2001): \u201c...words in different languages that are similar in form and meaning, without making a distinction between borrowed and genetically related words; for example, English \u2018sprint\u2019 and the Japanese borrowing \u2018supurinto\u2019 are considered cognate, even though these two languages are unrelated.\u201d These broader criteria are motivated by the ways scientists develop and use cognate identification algorithms in natural language processing (NLP) systems. For cross-lingual applications, the advantage of such technology is the ability to identify words for which similarity in meaning can be accurately inferred from similarity in form; it does not matter if the similarity in form is from strict genetic relationship or later borrowing (Mericli and Bloodgood, 2012).\nCognates detection has received a lot of attention in the literature. The research of the use of statistical learning methods to build systems that can automatically perform cognates detection has yielded many interesting and creative approaches for gaining traction on this challenging task. Currently, the highest-performing state of the art systems detect cognates based on the combination of multiple sources of information. Some of the most indicative sources of information discovered to date are word context information, phonetic information, word frequency information, temporal information in the form of word frequency distributions across parallel time periods, and word burstiness information. See section 3 for fuller explanations of each of these sources of information that state of the art systems currently use. Scores for all pairs of words from language L1 x language L2 are generated by generating component scores based on these sources of information and then combining them in an appropriate manner. Simple methods of combination are giving equal weight-\nThis paper is to appear in the Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Vancouver, Canada, 2017. c\u00a92017 Association for Computational Linguistics\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n07 05\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n4 A\npr 2\n01 7\ning for each score, while state of the art performance is obtained by learning an optimal set of weights from a small seed set of known cognates. Once the full matrix of scores is generated, the word pairs with the highest scores are predicted as being cognates.\nThe methods we propose in the current paper consume as input the final score matrix that state of the art methods create. We test if our methods can improve performance by generating new rescored matrices by rescoring all of the pairs of words by taking into account global constraints that apply to cognates detection. Thus, our methods are complementary to previous methods for creating cognates detection systems. Using global constraints and performing rescoring to improve cognates detection has not been explored yet. We find that rescoring based on global constraints improves performance significantly beyond current state of the art levels.\nThe cognates detection task is an interesting task to apply our methods to for a few reasons:\n\u2022 It\u2019s a challenging unsolved task where ongoing research is frequently reported in the literature trying to improve performance;\n\u2022 There is significant room for improvement in performance;\n\u2022 It has a global structure in its output classifications since if a word lemma1 wi from language L1 is cognate with a word lemma wj from language L2, then wi is not cognate with any other word lemma from L2 different from wj and wj is not cognate with any other word lemma wk from L1.\n\u2022 There are multiple standard datasets freely and publicly available that have been worked on with which to compare results.\n\u2022 Different datasets and language pairs yield initial score matrices with very different qualities. Some of the score matrices built using the existing state of the art best approaches yield performance that is quite low (11-point interpolated average precision of only approximately 16%) while some of these score\n1A lemma is a base form of a word. For example, in English the words \u2018baked\u2019 and \u2018baking\u2019 would both map to the lemma \u2018bake\u2019. Lemmatizing software exists for many languages and lemmatization is a standard preprocessing task conducted before cognates detection.\nmatrices for other language pairs and data sets have state of the art score matrices that are already able to achieve 11-point interpolated average precision of 57%.\nAlthough we are not aware of work using global constraints to perform rescoring to improve cognates detection, there are related methodologies for reranking in different settings. Methodologically related work includes past work in structured prediction and reranking (Collins, 2002; Collins and Roark, 2004; Collins and Koo, 2005; Taskar et al., 2005a,b). Note that in these past works, there are many instances with structured outputs that can be used as training data to learn a structured prediction model. For example, a seminal application in the past was using online training with structured perceptrons to learn improved systems for performing various syntactic analyses and tagging of sentences such as POS tagging and base noun phrase chunking (Collins, 2002). Note that in those settings the unit at which there are structural constraints is a sentence. Also note that there are many sentences available so that online training methods such as discriminative training of structured perceptrons can be used to learn structured predictors effectively in those settings. In contrast, for the cognates setting the unit at which there are structural constraints is the entire set of cognates for a language pair and there is only one such unit in existence (for a given language pair). We call this a single overarching global structure to make the distinction clear. The method we present in this paper deals with a single overarching global structure on the predictions of all instances in the entire problem space for a task. For this type of setting, there is only a single global structure in existence, contrasted with the situation of there being many sentences each imposing a global structure on the tagging decisions for that individual sentence. Hence, previous structured prediction methods that require numerous instances each having a structured output on which to train parameters via methods such as perceptron training are inapplicable to the cognates setting. In this paper we present methods for rescoring effectively in settings with a single overarching global structure and show their applicability to improving the performance of cognates detection. Still, we note that philosophically our method builds on previous structured prediction methods since in both cases there is a similar intuition in that we\u2019re\nusing higher-level structural properties to inform and accordingly alter our system\u2019s predictions of values for subitems within a structure.\nIn section 2 we present our methods for performing rescoring of matrices based on global constraints such as those that apply for cognates detection. The key intuition behind our approach is that the scoring of word pairs for cognateness ought not be made independently as is currently done, but rather that global constraints ought to be taken into account to inform and potentially alter system scores for word pairs based on the scores of other word pairs. In section 3 we provide results of experiments testing the proposed methods on the cognates detection task on multiple datasets with multiple language pairs under multiple conditions. We show that the new methods complement and effectively improve performance over state of the art performance achieved by combining the major research breakthroughs that have taken place in cognates detection research to date. Complete precision-recall curves are provided that show the full range of performance improvements over the current state of the art that are achieved. Summary measurements of performance improvements, depending on the language pair and dataset, range from 6.73 absolute MaxF1 percentage points to 16.75 absolute MaxF1 percentage points and from 5.58 absolute 11-point interpolated average precision percentage points to 17.19 absolute 11-point interpolated average precision percentage points. Section 4 discusses the results and possible extensions of the method. Section 5 wraps up with the main conclusions."}, {"heading": "2 Algorithm", "text": "While our focus in this paper is on using global constraints to improve cognates detection, we believe that our method is useful more generally. We therefore abstract out some of the specifics of cognates detection and present our algorithm more generally in this section, with the hope that it will be able to be used in the future for other applications in addition to cognates detection. None of our abstraction harms understanding of our method\u2019s applicability to cognates detection and the fact that the method may be more widely beneficial does not in any way detract from the utility we show it has for improving cognates detection.\nA common setting is where one has a set X = {x1, x2, ..., xn} and a set Y = {y1, y2, ..., yn}\nwhere the task is to extract (x, y) pairs such that (x, y) are in some relation R. Here are examples:\n\u2022 X might be a set of states and Y might be a set of cities and the relation R might be \u201cis the capital of\u201d;\n\u2022 X might be a set of images and Y might be a set of people\u2019s names and the relation R might be \u201cis a picture of\u201d;\n\u2022 X might be a set of English words and Y might be a set of French words and the relation R might be \u201cis cognate with\u201d.\nA common way these problems are approached is that a model is trained that can score each pair (x, y) and those pairs with scores above a threshold are extracted. We propose that often the relation will have a tendency, or a hard constraint, to satisfy particular properties and that this ought to be utilized to improve the quality of the extracted pairs.\nThe approach we put forward is to re-score each (x, y) pair by utilizing scores generated for other pairs and our knowledge of properties of the relation being extracted. In this paper, we present and evaluate methods for improving the scores of each (x, y) pair for the case when the relation is known to be one-to-one and discuss extensions to other situations.\nThe current approach is to generate a matrix of scores for each candidate pair as follows:\nScoreX,Y = sx1,y1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 sx1,yn... . . . ... sxn,y1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 sxn,yn  . (1) Then those pairs with scores above a threshold are predicted as being in the relation. We now describe methods for sharpening the scores in the matrix by utilizing the fact that there is an overarching global structure on the predictions."}, {"heading": "2.1 Reverse Rank", "text": "We know that if (xi, yj) \u2208 R, then (xk, yj) /\u2208 R for k 6= i when R is 1-to-1. We define reverse rank(xi, yj) = |{xk \u2208 X|sxk,yj \u2265 sxi,yj}|. Intuitively, a high reverse rank means that there are lots of other elements of X that score better to yj than xi does; this could be evidence that (xi, yj) is not in R and ought to have a lower score. Alternatively, if there are very few or no other elements of X that score better to yj than xi does this\ncould be evidence that (xi, yj) is in R and ought to have a higher score. In accord with this intuition, we use reverse rank as the basis for rescaling our scores as follows:\nscoreRR(xi, yj) = sxi,yj\nreverse rank(xi, yj) . (2)"}, {"heading": "2.2 Forward Rank", "text": "Analogous to reverse rank, another basis we can use for adjusting scores is the forward rank. We define forward rank(xi, yj) = |{yk \u2208 Y |sxi,yk \u2265 sxi,yj}|. We then scale the scores analogously to how we did with reverse ranks via an inverse linear function.2"}, {"heading": "2.3 Combining Reverse Rank and Forward Rank", "text": "For combining reverse rank and forward rank, we present results of experiments doing it two ways. The first is a 1-step approach:\nscoreRR FR 1step(xi, yj) = sxi,yj\nproduct , (3)\nwhere\nproduct =reverse rank(xi, yj)\u00d7 forward rank(xi, yj).\n(4)\nThe second combination method involves first computing the reverse rank and re-adjusting every score based on the reverse ranks. Then in a second step the new scores are used to compute forward ranks and then those scores are adjusted based on the forward ranks. We refer to this method as RR FR 2step."}, {"heading": "2.4 Maximum Assignment", "text": "If one makes the assumption that all elements in X and Y are present and have their partner element in the other set present with no extra elements and the sets are not too large, then it is interesting to compute what the \u2018maximal assignment\u2019 would be using the Hungarian Algorithm to optimize:\nmax Z\u2208X\u00d7Y \u2211 (x,y)\u2208Z score(x, y)\ns.t.

For our larger datasets where the assumptions don\u2019t hold, the Hungarian either can\u2019t complete due to limited computational resources or it functioned poorly in comparison with the performance of our reverse rank and forward rank combination methods."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": "Our goal is to test whether using the global structure algorithms we described in section 2 can significantly boost performance for cognates detection. To test this hypothesis, our first step is to implement a system that uses state of the art research results to generate the initial score matrices as a current state of the art system would currently do for this task. To that end, we implemented a baseline state of the art system that uses the information sources that previous research has found to be helpful for this task such as phonetic information, word context information, temporal context information, word frequency information, and word burstiness information (Kondrak, 2001; Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002; Klementiev and Roth, 2006; Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013). Consistent with past work (Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013), we use supervised training to learn the weights for combining the various information sources. The system combines the sources of information by using weights learned by an SVM (Support Vector Machine) on a small seed training set of cognates3 to optimize performance. This baseline system obtains state of the art performance on cognates detection. Using this state of the art system as our baseline, we investigated how much we could improve performance beyond current state of the art levels by applying the rescoring algorithm we described in section 2. We performed experiments on three language pairs: French-English, German-English, and Spanish-English, with different text corpora used as training and test data. The different language pairs and datasets have different levels of performance in terms of their baseline current state of the art score matrices. In the\n3The small seed set was randomly selected and less than 20% in all cases. It was not used for testing. Note that using this data to optimize performance of the baseline system makes our baseline even stronger and makes it even harder for our new rescoring method to achieve larger improvements.\nnext few subsections, we describe our experimental details."}, {"heading": "3.1 Lemmatization", "text": "We used morphological analyzers to convert the words in text corpora to lemma form.

From these corpora we compute word context similarity scores across languages using Rapp\u2019s method (Rapp, 1995, 1999). The intuition behind this method is that cognates are more likely to occur in correlating context windows and this statistic inferred from large amounts of data captures this correlation."}, {"heading": "3.3 Frequency Information", "text": "The intuition is that over large amounts of data cognates should have similar relative frequencies. We compute our relative frequencies by using the same corpora mentioned in the previous subsection."}, {"heading": "3.4 Temporal Information", "text": "The intuition is that cognates will have similar temporal distributions (Klementiev and Roth, 2006). To compute the temporal similarity we use newspaper data and convert it to simple daily word counts. For each word in the corpora the word counts create a time series vector. The Fourier transform is computed on the time series vectors. Spearman rank correlation is computed on the transform vectors. For English we used the English Gigaword Fifth Edition4.

At this point the matrix of scores would be used to predict cognates. We now turn to evaluation of the use of the global constraint rescoring methods from section 2 for improving performance beyond the state of the art levels."}, {"heading": "3.8 Using Global Constraints to Rescore", "text": "For our cognates data we used the French-English pairs from (Bergsma and Kondrak, 2007) and the German-English and Spanish-English pairs from (Beinborn et al., 2013). Figure 1 shows the precision-recall7 curves for\n7Precision and recall are the standard measures used for systems that perform search. Precision is the percentage of predicted cognates that are indeed cognate. Recall is the percentage of cognates that are predicted as cognate. We vary the threshold that determines cognateness to generate all points along the Precision-Recall curve. We start with a very high threshold enabling precision of 100% and lower the threshold until recall of 100% is reached. In particular, we sort the test examples by score in descending order and then go down the list of scores in order to complete the entire precision-recall curve.\nFrench-English, Figure 2 shows the performance for German-English, and Figure 3 shows the performance for Spanish-English. Note that state of the art performance (denoted in the figures as Baseline) has very different performance across the three datasets, but in all cases the systems from section 2 that incorporate global constraints and perform rescoring greatly exceed current state of the art performance levels. The Max Assignment is really just the single point that the Hungarian finds. We drew lines connecting it, but keep in mind those lines are just connecting the single point to the endpoints. Max Assignment Score traces the precision-recall curve back from the Max Assignment by steadily increasing the threshold so that only points in the maximum assignment set with scores above the increasing threshold are predicted as cognate.\nFor the non-max assignment curves, it is sometimes helpful to compute a single metric summarizing important aspects of the full curve. For this purpose, maxF1 and 11-point interpolated average precision are often used. MaxF1 is the F1 measure (i.e., harmonic mean of precision and recall) at the point on the precision-recall curve where F1 is highest. The interpolated precision pinterp at a given recall level r is defined as the highest precision level found for any recall level r\u2032 \u2265 r:\npinterp(r) = maxr\u2032\u2265rp(r \u2032). (7)\nThe 11-point interpolated average precision (11-point IAP) is then the average of the pinterp at r = 0.0, 0.1, ..., 1.0. Table 1 shows these performance measures for French-English, Table 2\nshows the results for German-English, and Table 3 show the results for Spanish-English. In all cases, using global structure greatly improves upon the state of the art baseline performance. In (Bergsma and Kondrak, 2007), for French-English data a result of 66.5 11-point IAP is reported for a situation where word alignments from a bitext are available and a result of 77.7 11-point IAP is reported for a situation where translation pairs are available in large quantities. The setting considered in the current paper is much more challenging since it does not use bilingual dictionaries or word alignments from bitexts. The setting in the current paper is the one mentioned as future work on page 663 of (Bergsma and Kondrak, 2007): \u201dIn particular, we plan to investigate approaches that do not re-\nquire the bilingual dictionaries or bitexts to generate training data.\u201d\nNote that the evaluation thus far is a bit artificial for real cognates detection because in a real setting you wouldn\u2019t only be selecting matches for relatively small subsets of words that are guaranteed to have a cognate on the other side. Such was the case for our evaluation where the French-English set had approx. 600 cognate pairs, the German-English set had approx. 1000 pairs, and the Spanish-English set had approx. 3000 pairs. In a real setting, the system would have to consider words that don\u2019t have a cognate match in the other language and not only words that were hand-selected and guaranteed to have cognates. We are not aware of others evaluating according to this much more difficult condition, but we think it is important to consider especially given the potential impacts it could have on the global structure methods we\u2019ve put forward. Therefore, we run a second set of evaluations where we take the ten thousand most common words in our corpora for each of our languages, which contain many of the cognates from the standard test sets and we add in any remaining words from the standard test sets that didn\u2019t make it into the top ten thousand. We then repeat each of the experi-\nments under this much more challenging condition. With approx. ten thousand squared candidates, i.e., approx. 100 million candidates, to consider for cognateness, this is a large data condition. The Hungarian didn\u2019t run to completion on two of the datasets due to limited computational resources. On French-English it completed, but achieved poorer performance than any of the other methods. This makes sense as it is designed when there really is a bipartite matching to be found like in the artificial yet standard cognates evaluation that was just presented. When confronted with large amounts of words that create a much denser space and have no match at all on the other side the all or nothing assignments of the Hungarian are not ideal. The reverse rank and forward rank rescoring methods are still quite effective in improving performance although not by as much as they did in the small data results from above.\nFigure 4 shows the full precision-recall curves for French-English for the large data condition, Figure 5 shows the curves for German-English for the large data condition, and Figure 6 shows the results for Spanish-English for the large data condition.\nTables 4 through 6 show the summary metrics for the three language pairs for the large data experiments. We can see that the reverse rank and forward rank methods of taking into account the global structure of interactions among predictions is still helpful, providing large improvements in performance even in this challenging large data condition over strong state of the art baselines that\nmake cognate predictions independently of each other and don\u2019t do any rescoring based on global constraints."}, {"heading": "4 Discussion", "text": "We believe that this work opens up new avenues for further exploration.
