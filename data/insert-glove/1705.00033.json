The common ensemble technique in wind and solar power forecasting is the blending of meteorological data from several sources.

INTRODUCTION\nThe wind and solar energy resources have created operational challenges for the electric power grid due to the uncertainty involved in their output in the short term. The intermittency of these resources may adversely affect the operation of the electric grid when the penetration levels of these variable generations are high. Thus, wherever the variable generation resources are used, it becomes highly desirable to maintain higher than normal operating reserves and efficient energy storage systems to manage the power balance in the system. The operating reserves that use fossil fuel generating units should be kept to a minimum in order to get the maximum benefit from the deployment of the renewable resources. Therefore, the forecast of these variable generations becomes a vital tool in the operation of the power systems and electricity markets [1].\nAs in wind power forecasting, the solar power also consists of a variety of methods based on the time horizon being forecasted, the data available to the forecaster and the particular application of the forecast. The methods are broadly categorized according to the time horizon in which they generally show value. Methods that are common in solar power forecasting include Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and Model Output Statistics (MOS) to produce forecasts, as well as hybrid techniques that combine ensemble forecasts and Statistical Learning Methods [2]. Applying machine learning\ntechniques directly to historical time series of solar photovoltaic (PV) production associated with NWP outcomes have placed among the top models in the recent global competition of energy forecasting, GEFCom2014 [3]. Just to name a few of the machine learning tools, the artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR), gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), etc. are believed to be the most common.\nHybrid models of two or more statistical and physical techniques are often combined to capture complex interactions and provide useful insights and better forecasts. In ref. [4], the authors implement a hybrid model that consists of ARMA and ANN to forecast the solar irradiance by NWP data for 5 locations of a Mediterranean climate. They found the proposed model outperforms the na\u00efve persistence model and improvement with respect to its core techniques as well. The study reported in ref. [5] presents the benefits of combining the data of solar irradiance that is derived from a satellite with ground-measured data to improve the intraday forecasts in the range up to six hours ahead. In ref [6], the authors combine satellite images with ANN outcomes to forecast the solar irradiance of leading time up to two hours for two sites in California.\nIn ref. [7], several statistical combining methods are used to combine multiple linear regression models for load forecasting, and the authors conclude that the regression combining technique is the best. While ref. [8] uses several statistical models to forecast the hourly PV electricity production for the next day at some power plants in France, the random forest (RF) has shown a superior performance. Ref. [9] also found the random forest has the best performance among others to predict the daily solar irradiance variability of four sites with different climatic conditions in Australia. The authors of [10] used random forest with other models as well to forecast the solar power in GEF2014 competition. They indicate that the random forest and the gradient boosting technique are the most accurate models. In the aforementioned studies, RF is not implemented there as a combining method; it is a standalone forecasting model that depends on its own trees.\nThe commonly used ensemble technique in wind and solar power forecasting is to blend the weather data from several sources. As in ref. [11], the authors compare several data-\nNote: This is a pre-print of the full paper that published in Innovative Smart Grid Technologies, North America Conference, 2017, which can be referenced as below:\nM. Abuella and B. Chowdhury, \u201cRandom Forest Ensemble of Support Vector Regression for Solar Power Forecasting,\u201d in Proceedings of Innovative Smart Grid\nTechnologies, North America Conference, 2017.\ndriven models using input data from two NWPs and building two artificial hybrid and stochastic ensemble models based on ANN, the model that combines multiple models outperforms the rest of the models. It points out that the ensemble is enhanced by including forecasts with similar accuracy, but generated from NWP data of higher variance and different data-driven techniques. Ref. [12] uses Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) to produce weather scenarios by running multiple initials to quantify the uncertainty and then produce the probabilistic solar power forecasts of sites in Italy. Ref. [13] applies a physical post processing and ANN to improve the solar irradiance forecasts of one and two days ahead.\nThe majority of the existing research literature on combining forecasting methods of solar forecasts do not include the previously generated forecasts to boost the model performance. It can be useful to add these past models\u2019 outcomes as well into the ensemble learning methods. The research team from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and IBM Thomas Watson Research Center [17] deployed and tested several machine-learning techniques to blend three NWPs outcomes. They conclude that the ensemble approaches that take into account the diversity and the state parameters of the models provide lower errors in the solar irradiance forecasting. Although these studies forecast the solar irradiance at different sites in the U.S., the time period is limited since they do not investigate the performance of the different seasons over the entire year.\nUsing RF as a combining method of other models in solar power is scarce. This paper adopts RF to combine the forecasts for a PV system and investigates the performance throughout a complete year. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the ensemble method that is used to build and combine the SVR models. Section III discusses the methodology of combining the solar power forecasts. Section IV presents the results and the evaluation of the model. Section V provides the conclusions.\nII. ENSEMBLE LEARNING\nThe algorithms that use decision trees can be useful to combine the different models\u2019 outcomes efficiently. This ensemble approach combines all the outputs from variant models besides the features, such as the weather data that allow the ensemble method to find the associative rules to determine the best output. For instance, if the weather is sunny, then model A performs best, and its output should be selected; otherwise model B should be selected, and so on. This ensemble learning approach has shown very promising results in numerous machine learning benchmarks. For more details on this topic, i.e., ensemble learning and its techniques as bagging, boosting, stacking, and Bayesian averaging, the interested reader may refer to [16], The general diagram of combining the models is shown in Fig.1."}, {"heading": "A. Random Forest", "text": "Since the classification and regression trees (CART) use the bagging principle of the ensemble learning, and they are built by the same data, these trees are sometimes correlated and statistically dependent. Consequently, to make the trees more variant and uncorrelated, Breiman [17] proposed that each split\nof the bagged tree should be grown by a random number of features and observation samples. Hence, this method is called the random forest (RF).\nFig.1. General diagram of combining different models\nThree parameters are required to be set in RF, the number of trees B (forest size), m the number of predictors out of p available variables (features) that are randomly chosen to be used for each split, and the minimum number nmin of observations per node (leaf size).\nThe random forest building algorithm [16] has three major steps.\n\u2022 Create B sample datasets of size N from the training data; these sample datasets can be replaced and overlapped.\n\u2022 For each sample dataset, grow a random forest tree Tb, by repeating the following steps for each terminal node, until the minimum node size nmin is reached:\nI.

This process of decorrelation of the trees makes the random forest outcomes less variable, and hence more reliable.\nIII. MODELING"}, {"heading": "A.

For the aggregation of daily RMSEs over the whole month, it is obvious the ensemble forecasts (black line) has a lower RMSE than SVR models and the simple average combining method (dark blue line). However, in a few days, the best SVR model (model-4) or the average method could be more accurate, as in 6th, 7th, 16th, 28th, and 29th days, when they have a lower RMSE.\nThe fluctuation in the daily RMSE can be seen among the 24 SVR models, and it\u2019s a normal trend in the forecasting models. However, the ensemble method produces more accurate combined forecasts and the performance of this combining model becomes more stable than in the individual SVR models.\nFig.6. Daily RMSE of different models and combined forecasts, October\nTo get a broader evaluation of the combined forecasts performance, the comparison is conducted with the best model (model 4) and the simple average method over a complete year, as shown in TABLE I. It is clear that the ensemble method has lower monthly RMSEs. The improvement rate of the ensemble method over the other methods is calculated as in (5). In some months such as October, the ensemble method has an improvement rate of 18% and 28% over the best model and the average method respectively. For two months where the improvement rate is negative, such as in March the simple average and the best model are better than the ensemble, and also in June, the best model has the lowest monthly RMSE.\nIn general, the aggregated mean (i.e., the statistical average) of the monthly RMSEs indicates that the combined forecasts from the ensemble method have the most accurate forecasts (RMSEmean=0.0725), while, the total improvement of the ensemble method over the average and the best model is 9% and 5 % respectively.\nNotice that the monthly RMSE is calculated for all hours of the month where n in (4) is not the day hour, but rather the month hours. Thus, it could be 744, or any other number of hours depending on the month.\nThe Random Forest is a nonlinear model and a black-box and difficult to analyze. In order to get an idea about the performance of the model, a statistical analysis is conducted. Firstly, the importance estimation of the RF inputs (features) is found. This would be available since one of the algorithm steps is to estimate the best features to split the nodes, as explained in Section II.A. October and March are chosen for this analysis, because in these months, the largest change in the ensemble method performance occurs. The features are the weather variables and the 24 SVRs\u2019 outcomes. As shown in Fig.7 and Fig.8, the features do not have the similar pattern of importance; thereby, in the data training by RF, they would give different results and different performance.\nSecondly, a statistical analysis by finding the standard deviation and the correlation between the SVR models\u2019 outcomes is conducted over the full year. Fig.9 presents the histograms of this statistical metrics.\n(a) (b)\nFig.7.

These combined forecasts are produced from an intelligent weighting approach that takes into account the weather situations, the past forecast of the forecasting models (24 SVRs), and their different temporal horizons - these all are used as associative rules in the ensemble method to yield accurate forecasts and a stable performance. The simple average as a combining method is not enough to get better forecasts since it does not capture or represent all the varieties in the weather data, and hence the solar power forecast. The forecasting errors are inherited mostly from the NWP model errors, and some of the errors resulting from the technical degrading of the physical systems (PV modules efficiency, orientation, etc.). Adding the past generated forecasts increases the accuracy of the combined forecasts.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J. M. Morales, A. J. Conejo, H. Madsen, P. Pinson, and M.
