In the Bayesian inference setting, z denotes unknown parameters and p(z) represents a posterior over\n1College of Computing and Information Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA.

Computing p(z) thus requires a full pass over the dataset. The idea of Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (Welling & Teh, 2011) is to get an unbiased estimate of the gradient of log p(z) by approximating the posterior using a minibatch. Since the gradient term is multiplied by \u270f, the variance of its error has order \u270f2, while the variance of p \u270f\u2318 has order \u270f. Thus, with a small step \u270f, the injected noise dominates, meaning one can might expect these to have a stationary distribution close to the target p(z).\nThe idea of variational inference is to posit a simple family of distributions qw(z) and then optimize w to minimize the KL-divergence from qw(z) to the target p(z). (In a Bayesian setting, this is equivalent to maximizing the evidence lower bound.) If one were to use plain gradient ascent to perform this optimization, this leads to the iterate of\nw w + \u270f 2 rwEqw(Z)[log p(Z) log qw(Z)], (2)\nwhere the gradient step \u270f is divided by two for convenience, and may again decay over time. In practice, doing gradient ascent like this has two difficulties. First, in the Bayesian inference setting, computing log p(z) requires a full pass over the data. This can be approximated without bias using a minibatch. The second difficulty stems from the expectation of log p(z) with respect to qw(z) in Eq. 2. The gradient of this expectation can be approximated in different ways using samples from qw(Z) (Section 3.2). Since this gives unbiased estimates of the gradient, stochastic optimization methods, such as stochastic gradient descent, will converge to a local optima when the step-size becomes small.\nIntuitively, both MCMC and variational methods can be thought of as trying to find a high-probability region of log p(z), with different strategies to encourage entropy to get coverage of the distribution. In MCMC, entropy is created by randomness in the Markov chain, while in variational methods the KL-divergence directly measures the entropy of the variational distribution. It is natural to think that hybrid methods might employ fractions of these two strategies. This paper does so by defining a distribution over the parameters w of the approximating family q(z|w). This distribution q(w) is designed to minimize a bound on the KL-divergence of the resulting marginal distribution\nar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n06 52\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n0 Ju\nn 20\n17\nq(z) to the target p(z). Intuitively, when defining q(w), there are two ways to encourage entropy, namely to give higher density to vectors w where q(Z|w) has high entropy or to encourage entropy over w itself.\nGiven a distribution q(w, z) and a target distribution p(z), this paper uses two bounds on the marginal divergence Dtrue = KL (q(Z)kp(Z)) . First, one can upper-bound by the conditional divergence D0 = KL (q(Z|W )kp(Z)). Second, one can \u201cadjoin\u201d some distribution p(w|z) to p(z), and bound Dtrue by the joint divergence D1 = KL (q(W, Z)kp(W, Z)). This paper takes a convex combination of these two bounds, i.e. uses the family of bounds D = (1 )D0 + D1 . For any between 0 and 1, the distribution q(w) is derived that minimizes this bound for fixed p and a fixed approximating family q(z|w) (Theorem 3). Then, one can sample from this distribution over w by (stochastic) Langevin dynamics. This turns out to lead to the iterate\nw w + \u270f 2 rw\n\u21e3 Eqw [log p(Z) + ( 1) log qw(Z)]\n+ log r(w) \u2318 + p \u270f \u2318, (3)\nwhere r(w) is related to the adjoining distribution p(w|z) and may be thought of as a \u201cbase measure\u201d 1 over the space of w. Of course, exactly computing this gradient is intractable in general, but the same strategies used for variational inference can be used to efficiently compute an un-\n1To see why r is necessary, consider a reparameterization of w. In order for the marginal distribution q(z) to stay the same, the density of the base measure must be transformed corresponding to the reparameterization. Put another way, without r(w), the results of inference would depend on the parameterization of w, even with an arbitrarily small step-size.\nbiased estimate.\nIt can be shown that as ! 0, the solution concentrates in the optima of the variational optimization, and thus the sampling algorithm reduces to gradient ascent on the variational objective. Meanwhile, as will be discussed in Sections 2.3 and 5 it is best to make r a function of such that w with high entropy have less density when approaches 1. When this is true, then as ! 1, only w indexing highly concentrated distributions over z retain density, and so sampling from q(w) is essentially just a reparameterization of sampling from p(z), and the algorithm reduces to Langevin dynamics.\nThus, for the extreme cases of = 0 and = 1, this algorithm reduces to variational inference and Langevin dynamics, respectively. Informally, at these extremes, the algorithm is \u201cfast but approximate\u201d and \u201cslow but accurate\u201d. In the intermediate range, the algorithm exhibits new behavior with a fine-grained trade-off between speed and accuracy. Thus, this approach gives a smooth continuum of algorithms with different priorities of speed and accuracy."}, {"heading": "1.1. Notation", "text": "This paper uses three notational conventions that are not universal. First, the conditional probability q(z|w) will alternatively be written as qw(z) when convenient. Second, A ' B indicates that A and B have the same expected value or (if A is a constant) that B is an unbiased estimator of A. Finally, upper and lower-cases indicate what terms are random variables in a KL-divergence. So, KL (q(Z|w)kp(Z|w)) = Eq(Z|w) log (q(Z|w)/p(Z|w)) is the divergence between q(z|w) and p(z|w) for a fixed w, while KL (q(Z|W )kp(Z|W )) =\nEq(W,Z) log (q(Z|W )/p(Z|W )) is a standard conditional divergence."}, {"heading": "2. Information Theoretic Results", "text": "This section derives a few results from an information theoretic viewpoint, without any particular regard for form of the target distribution, or how one might sample from it. Proofs are given in the appendix."}, {"heading": "2.1. Preliminaries", "text": "Let p(z) be the target distribution. For simplicity, z is treated here as a continuous variable, although the results in this section remain true if it is discrete. There is some fixed set of conditional distributions q(z|w), which may also be written as qw(z). In principle, one might like to know how to set q(w) such that the resulting marginal distribution over z, is close to p(z), as measured by the KLdivergence,\nDtrue = KL (q(Z)kp(Z)) = Eq(Z) log q(Z)\np(Z) . (4)\nThis quantity is difficult to control directly, since the marginal q(z) typically cannot be evaluated in closed form. One bound comes from the conditional KL-divergence, as stated in the following Lemma.\nLemma 1. The divergence from q(z) to p(z) is\nKL (q(Z)kp(Z)) = KL (q(Z|W )kp(Z))| {z } D0 Iq[W, Z],\n(5) where D0 = Eq(W,Z) log (q(Z|W )/p(Z)) is the conditional divergence and Iq = KL (q(Z, W )kq(Z)q(W )) denotes mutual information under q.\nA second bound comes from adjoining some distribution p(w|z) to p(z). Then, the following lemma is essentially just a re-statement of the chain rule for the KL-divergence (Cover & Thomas, 2006, Thm. 2.5.3).\nLemma 2. The KL-divergence between q(z) and p(z) can be written as\nKL(q(Z)kp(Z))) = KL (q(W, Z)kp(W, Z))| {z } D1\nKL (q(W |Z)kp(W |Z)) . (6)\nSince the mutual information in Eq. 5 and the conditional divergence on the right of Eq. 6 are both non-negative, both D0 and D1 are upper-bounds on Dtrue. Note that if p(w|z) = q(w), then D1 = D0, and so Lemma 1 follows from Lemma 2."}, {"heading": "2.2. Divergence Bound and its Minimizer", "text": "This paper is based on convex combination of D0 and D1 , parameterized by some 2 [0, 1], namely\nD = (1 )D0 + D1.

This can also be seen directly, since it can be written as A = log R w\np(w) exp( KL (q(Z|w)kp(Z|w)) 1 1 KL (q(Z|w)kp(Z))), and the inner divergences as well as 1 1 are non-negative. To understand the connection of this bound to variational inference and MCMC, one can look at behavior where = 0 or where = 1. For the former case, one obtains a result closely related to the solution to the variational inference problem. Remark 4. In the limit where ! 0 the divergence bound at the optimal q\u21e4 becomes\nlim !0 D\u21e4 = inf w KL (q(Z|w)kp(Z)) . (9)\nSimilarly, when ! 0, q\u21e4(w) concentrates at the minimizer(s) of this divergence. (Formally, with multiple global optima with the same divergence, q(w) will concentrate equally around all minimizers.)\nFor the case where = 1 , it is easy to see that\nD\u21e41 = log Z\nw p(w) exp ( KL (q(Z|w)kp(Z|w))) , (10)\nwhich will be zero if p(w) is only supported on w where the divergence between q(z|w) and p(z|w) is zero. This may initially seem like a strange condition, given that p(w) results from both the target distribution p(z) and the adjoined distribution p(w|z). However, the next section gives more specifics.\n2.3. Specific Form for p(w|z) The results in the previous section were written without without considering the specific form of p(w|z). This paper takes the approach of defining\np(w|z) = r(w)q(z|w) rz , (11)\nwhere r(w) is a possibly improper distribution over w and rz = R w\nr(w)q(z|w) is a normalizer. Note that p(w|z) is still well-defined as long as the integral defining rz exists.\nHere, we assume for convenience that rz is a constant, not depending on z. Enforcing rz to be constant essentially means choosing r(w) in such a way that it doesn\u2019t \u201cfavor\u201d any z over any other since if q(w) / r(w) then q(z) is uniform over z.\nLemma 5. If p(w|z) = r(w)q(z|w)/rz and rz is a constant, then the solution in Thm. 3 holds with\ns(w) = log r(w) log rz + Eqw(Z)[ 1 log p(Z) + (1 1) log qw(Z)]. (12)\nThis gives a distribution over q(w) that can be written in various equivalent ways, such as\nq\u21e4(w) / r(w) exp 1E(w) + ( 1 1)H(w) (13)\n=r(w) exp H(w) 1KL (qw(Z)kp(Z))\n=r(w) exp1/ E qw(Z) [log p(Z) + ( 1) log qw(Z)] ,\nwhere H(w) = Eqw(Z)[log qw(Z)] is the entropy of qw and E(w) = Eqw(z)[log p(Z)].\nHere, r(w) plays a role similar to a base density in an exponential family. If one simply used r(w) = 1, then p(w|z) may not be well-defined. Further, without a base density, the marginal q(z) would depend on the particular parameterization of w. To see this, take single parameter w, and imagine re-parameterizing so the negative reals are \u201csquashed\u201d by a factor of two. The base density must increase by a factor of two for the negative reals to compensate in order to leave the marginal q(z) unchanged under the reparameterization."}, {"heading": "2.4. Latent variables in variational inference", "text": "Adjoining p(w|z) to p(z) to define D1 above is strongly related to auxiliary random variables (Agakov & Barber, 2004) explored in variational inference to increase the representative power of q, e.g. by including latent stochastic transition operators (Salimans et al., 2015), random Gaussian process mappings (Tran et al., 2016), or hierarchical variables (Ranganath et al., 2016). Imagine doing variational inference with q\u2713(z, w), where now w is auxiliary\nand the goal is to set \u2713 so that q\u2713(z) \u21e1 p(z). Since w must be integrated out, the entropy of z under q is typically intractable, but can be bounded by augmenting p with some distribution p(w|z) and then optimizing the joint KLdivergence over z and w, similarly to Lemma 2. Note two differences. First, here the distribution over w is mathematically derived to minimize the bound, while previous work numerically optimizes \u2713 at run-time. Second, previous work also optimizes parameters of the distribution p(w|z) to further improve the bound, while here it is left fixed (for each ) for simplicity (Sec. 5). Future work might explore optimizing p(w|z) at run-time in the current paper\u2019s framework."}, {"heading": "3. Bayesian Inference", "text": "This section considers algorithms to sample from the distribution defined by Eq. 13. Probabilistic inference can be used in various settings, but for concreteness the rest of this paper will focus on Bayesian inference. To fix notation, suppose a set of N inputs xi with corresponding outputs yi. (In a generative setting, xi would be empty.) Then, if z is a vector of parameters, the posterior distribution over z is, up to a constant\nlog p(z) = log p0(z) + NX\ni=1\nlog p(yi|xi, z) + C, (14)\nwhere p0(z) is the prior, and p(yi|xi, z) is the likelihood for the i-th datum.

Langevin Dynamics", "text": "The goal of MCMC methods is to obtain samples from the target distribution p(z). Langevin dynamics sample by an extremely simple process of repeating gradient steps of log(z) with injected Gaussian noise. Specifically, the iterate is\nz z + \u270f 2 r log p(z) +p\u270f\u2318, (15)\nwhere \u2318 is sampled from a standard Multivariate Gaussian distribution and \u270f is a step-size that may decay over time. If Langevin dynamics are used as a proposal for a MetropolisHastings sampler, it can be shown that correct acceptance ratio is\nexp s(z0) s(z) + \u270f 8 krs(z)k2 \u270f 8 krs(z0)k2\n+ 1 2 (z z0) \u00b7 (rs(z) +rs(z0)) , (16)\nwhere s(z) = log p(z) up to a constant factor, and z0 is the proposed point from Eq. 15. It is easy to see that as \u270f becomes small, this acceptance ratio will go to one, and so one can disregard the acceptance step with some bias in the results determined by the step size.\nLangevin dynamics explore the space of z through a random walk, and thus are likely to be slower than alternatives such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo when used as an exact method (Neal, 2010, Section 5.2). The main practical advantage of Langevin dynamics comes from the case where the number of data N is large. In that case, one can use a minibatch of M elements and approximate r log p(z) as\nr log p(z) ' r log p0(z)+ N\nM\nX\ni2minibatch r log p(yi|xi, z).\n(17)\nThus, Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics, avoid a full pass through the dataset in each iteration, and so can scale to large datasets. Though Eq. 17 is an unbiased estimate of the gradient of log p(z) this still adds a bias to the stationary distribution of the the chain. (See (Mandt et al., 2016) for an analysis.) In the limit of a small step-size, the variance of the noise due to stochastic estimation of the gradient of log p(z) will be of order \u270f2 while the variance of the injected noise is of order \u270f, meaning the latter dominates (Welling & Teh, 2011; Teh et al., 2016)."}, {"heading": "3.2. Stochastic Gradient Variational Inference", "text": "The goal of variational inference is to maximize\nL(w) = Eqw(Z)[log p(Z) log qw(Z)], (18) equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence between qw(z) and p(z). If it were possible to exactly compute L, this could be maximized (to a local optima) by a simple gradient iteration like\nw w + \u270f 2 rwL(w). (19)\nWhile in some cases with specific p and q, one can derive exact updates of L (Ghahramani & Beal, 2000) in general one cannot exactly evaluate the expectation over Z in L. One line of approach to this (Ranganath et al., 2014; Salimans & Knowles, 2014) is to write the gradient as rL = Eqw(Z)[(log qw(Z) log p(Z))r log qw(Z)], and estimate this by drawing samples from qw(z). This experimentally seems to result in gradients with large variance, but this can be reduced by two strategies. Firstly, one can use control variates, based on either Taylor expansion (Paisley et al., 2012) or the fact that the expected value of rw log qw(Z) is zero. Secondly, since log p(z) is often a sum of terms defined on subsets of variables, one can RaoBlackwellize by integrating out other variables. This approach only needs to be able to compute log p(z)\u2013 no other access, even to the gradient of p, is needed."}, {"heading": "3.2.1. REPARAMETERIZATION TRICK", "text": "Another line of approach to variational inference is based on the \u201creparameterization trick\u201d (Kingma & Welling,\n2014; Rezende et al., 2014; Titsias & La\u0301zaro-Gredilla, 2014), known in the stochastic approximation literature as a \u201cpathwise\u201d derivative (Kushner & Yin, 2003, Sec. 2.5.1). Suppose that there is a deterministic mapping zr,w from parameters w and random numbers r (from some fixed standard distribution) such that zr,w \u21e0 qw(z). Then, we could equivalently write\nL(w) = ER[log p(zR,w)] + H(w). (20)\nwhere H(w) = Eqw(Z) log qw(Z) denotes the entropy. The advantage of Eq. 20 this is that the expectation is not a function of w, and so if computing the gradient of L, the gradient moves inside the expectation. Then, provided zr,w is differentiable with respect to w, an unbiased estimate of the gradient of L is available as\nrwL(w) ' rw log p(zr,w) +rwH(w).

For simple distributions like Gaussians zr,w this is easy to do analytically (Section 5). Alternatively, this can all be done efficiently by automatic differentiation, (Kucukelbir et al., 2017) the approach used here.\nAs with Langevin dynamics, with a large dataset, log p(z) can be approximated by taking a sum over a minibatch. The most obious approach to this would be to choose a single vector r and use it throughout the minibatch. However, variance can often be reduced by the \u201clocal reparameterization trick\u201d (Kingma et al., 2015) in which a different random vector ri is drawn for each datum in the minibatch. Intuitively, the motivation is that if i and j are two data in the minibatch then log p(yi|xi, zr,w) should be less correlated with log p(yj |xj , zr0,w) when a different random vector r0 is used for the second datum (consider the limiting case where all data are identical).

It is possible that other choices could be better, though performance was surprisingly insensitive in practice.

Experiments", "text": "There does not appear to be a single standard performance measure to evaluate approximate inference algorithms.

MMD is essentially the empirical difference of the means of two samples in some feature space. We first draw a sample from p(z) by exhaustively running a traditional MCMC algorithm (Stan (Team, 2016), based on a variant of Hamil-\ntonian Monte Carlo (Hoffman & Gelman, 2014)) for a large number of iterations, and compare this to the results of approximate inference. Since we have large samples, and want to compute the online performance at all iterations, a finite-dimensional feature space must be used to avoid the quadratic complexity of computing MMD using an arbitrary kernel. For two-dimensional problems, it was beneficial to use random Fourier features (Rahimi & Recht, 2007) to approximate the radial-basis function kernel k(x, y) = exp( kx yk2). For higher dimensions, the original feature space was sufficiently discriminative.\nApproximate inference gives a sequence of vectors wt. For each time-step, a set of 100 samples At are drawn from q(z|wt). Then, the MMD between A1[A2[ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 At and the sample from exhaustive MCMC can be computed for all t in linear time. A disadvantage of this approach is the need for exhaustive MCMC for comparison, which by definition eludes the large-scale cases that motivate Langevin dynamics and stochastic variational inference. However this gives a more fine-grained view of performance."}, {"heading": "6.1. Toy Distributions", "text": "For a first demonstration, the algorithm was applied to a set of toy 2-dimensional distributions, with various values of . A few results are shown in Fig. 1, with more in\nthe appendix. While the algorithm displays the expected trade-offs between speed and accuracy for different (Fig. 2), the results fairly uninteresting as all curves cross near the same time/MMD point where = 0 (variational inference) and = 1 (MCMC) meet. So, for any given amount of time, either variational inference or MCMC are nearoptimal, and so intermediate do not much expand the \u201cPareto frontier\u201d on these problems, although one might prefer an intermediate since the crossover horizon is not known in advance."}, {"heading": "6.2. Bayesian Logistic Regression", "text": "Next, the algorithm was applied to binary logistic regression with several standard datasets, using a minibatch size of 25, a different random vector r for each element in the minibatch, and a standard multivariate Laplace distribution as a prior. Simply picking a single value or schedule for the step \u270f is unsatisfactory, as the best schedule for a given problem, length of time, and value of varies. To give a fair comparison, inference was run for with a range of constant \u270f varying by factors of two from 23/N to 2 2/N . This spans the range from large enough to often diverge to below optimal even after 106 iterations. Then, for each time, the best value of \u270f was retrospectively chosen (with performance averaged over repetitions before this choice). It is likely that decaying step-size schedules would perform\nbetter, but this was not pursued since it would reduce transparency of the results.\nThe mean errors after 100 repetitions are shown in Fig. 4, while samples are compared to the ground truth for ionosphere in Fig. 3. This confirms the basic ideas of the algorithm, namely that it smoothly interpolates between the two previous algorithms without introducing any new behavior. The main experimental finding is that there is usually a large range of time horizons for which an intermediate setting of performs better than either of the previous existing algorithms. This suggests that, say, someone who has a time budget slightly larger than that needed for variational inference could benefit from running the algorithm with a small value of for a slightly larger time. This is in contrast to the toy two-dimensional examples where for almost all time horizons either = 0 or = 1 was optimal."}, {"heading": "7. Discussion", "text": "This paper has two contributions. First, a distribution over variational parameters is derived to minimize a bound on the marginal divergence to a target distribution. Secondly, this is used to derive an algorithm that interpolates between Langevin dynamics and stochastic variational inference. The Bayesian logistic regression experiments show that the intermediate values of this algorithm are useful in the sense that there are several orders of magnitude of time horizons where an intermediate algorithm performs better than either Langevin dynamics or variational inference.\nMany improvements to stochastic Langevin dynamics and variational inference have been proposed beyond the simple algorithms used here. For Langevin dynamics, Welling & Teh (2011) and Li et al. (2016) suggest adding a preconditioner, Patterson & Teh (2013) propose Riemannian Langevin Dynamics, and Dubey et al. (2016) propose to make use of the finite sum structure in a Bayesian posterior p(z) by incorporating techniques for incremental optimization. For stochastic variational inference, Hoffman et al.\n(2013) propose to use the natural gradient, Mandt & Blei (2014) propose using smoothed gradients, and Sakaya & Klami (2016) propose a strategy of re-using previous gradient computations. It would be interesting to consider using these ideas with the hybrid algorithm, which could give insight into the relationship between the two different methods.\nThere is other work based on combining the advantages of variational inference and MCMC. Stochastic Gradient Fisher Scoring (Ahn et al., 2012) interpolates between Langevin dynamics and a Gaussian approximation of the target. However, this approximation is based on the Bayesian central limit theorem and so will not be the same in general as the optimal variational distribution, even when a Gaussian is used as the variational family. Another line of research is that of interpreting the path of a MCMC algorithm as a variational distribution, and then fitting parameters to tighten a variational bound (Salimans et al., 2015; Rezende & Mohammed, 2015). While motivationally quite similar, the contribution of this paper is orthogonal, in that one could conceivably use these same ideas to define the variational family qw(z) used in this paper. This would result in a somewhat unusual method that runs MCMC over the parameters of variational family of distributions that are themselves defined in terms of a (different) MCMC algorithm."}, {"heading": "Ghahramani, Zoubin and Beal, Matthew J.

The divergence from q(z) to p(z) is\nKL (q(Z)kp(Z)) = KL (q(Z|W )kp(Z))| {z } D0 Iq[W, Z],\n(27) where D0 = Eq(W,Z) log (q(Z|W )/p(Z)) is conditional divergence and Iq denotes mutual information under q.\nProof. Define the joint distribution p(w, z) = q(w)p(z). Then, the chain-rule of KL-divergence (Cover & Thomas, 2006, Thm. 2.5.3) states that\nKL (q(Z, W )kp(Z, W )) = KL (q(W |Z)kp(W |Z)) + KL (q(Z)kp(Z)) . (28)\nThe left-hand side simplifies into D0, and the first term on the right-hand side simplifies into Iq[W, Z].\nTheorem 7.

First, consider derivatives of D0 and D1 with respect to q(w).

Using the above derivatives, we therefore have that\n0 =(1 )KL (q(Z|w)kp(Z)) + KL (q(Z|w)kp(Z|w)) log p(w) + log q(w) + ,\nWhich solved for q(w), this gives\nq(w) / exp (1 1)KL (q(Z|w)kp(Z))\nKL (q(Z|w)kp(Z|w)) + log p(w) ,\nwhich establishes the given form for s(w) and A.\nNow, to establish the value of D at the solution, expand the negative entropy of q(w) to get\nZ\nw\nq(w) log q(w)\n=\nZ\nw\nq(w) \u21e3 (1 1)KL (q(Z|w)kp(Z))\nKL (q(Z|w)kp(Z|w)) + log p(w) \u2318 A.

In the limit where ! 0 the divergence bound becomes\nlim !0 D\u21e4 = inf w KL (q(Z|w)kp(Z)) .\nProof.

MCMC tends to be accurate if run for a long enough time, while variational inference tends to give better approximations at shorter time horizons. However, the amount of time needed for MCMC to exceed the performance of variational methods can be quite high, motivating more fine-grained tradeoffs. This paper derives a distribution over variational parameters, designed to minimize a bound on the divergence between the resulting marginal distribution and the target, and gives an example of how to sample from this distribution in a way that interpolates between the behavior of existing methods based on Langevin dynamics and stochastic gradient variational inference (SGVI).", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
