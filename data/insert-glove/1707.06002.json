While understanding the structure of an argument is the predominant task of argument mining/computational argumentation (Mochales and Moens, 2011; Stab and Gurevych, 2014; Habernal and Gurevych, 2017), a parallel strand of research tries to assess qualitative properties of arguments (Habernal and Gurevych, 2016b; Stab and Gurevych, 2017). Yet the gap between theories and everyday argumentation, in understanding what \u2018argument quality\u2019 actually is, remains an open research question (Wachsmuth et al., 2017; Habernal and Gurevych, 2016a).\nArgumentation theories and critical thinking textbooks, however, offer an alternative view on quality of arguments, namely the notion of fallacies: prototypical argument schemes or types that pretend to be correct and valid arguments but suffer logically, emotionally, or rhetorically (Tindale, 2007; Hamblin, 1970). Although this topic was first brought up by Aristotle already some 2,300 years ago, contemporary research on fallacies still does not provide a unifying view and clashes even in the fundamental questions (Boudry et al., 2015; Paglieri, 2016). Nevertheless, there seem to be several types of fallacies, such as argument ad hominem,1 various emotional appeals, rhetorical moves of the red herring,2 or hasty generalization that are, unfortunately, widely spread in our everyday argumentative discourse. Their powerful and sometimes detrimental impact was revealed in a few manual analyses (Sahlane, 2012; Nieminen and Mustonen, 2014). To the best of our knowledge, there is neither any NLP research dealing with fallacies, nor any resources that would allow for empirical investigation of that matter.\nThe lack of fallacy-annotated linguistic resources and thus the need for creating and labeling a new dataset from scratch motivated us to investigate serious games (also games with a purpose)\u2014a scenario in which a task is gamified and users (players) enjoy playing a game without thinking much of the burden of annotations (von Ahn and Dabbish, 2008; Mayer et al., 2014). Serious games have been successful in NLP tasks that can be easily represented by images (Jurgens and Navigli, 2014; Kazemzadeh et al., 2014) or that can be simplified to assessing a single word or a pair of propositions (Neve\u030cr\u030cilova\u0301, 2014; Poesio et al., 2013). More complex tasks such as argument un-\n1Attacking the opponent instead of her argument 2Distracting to irrelevant issues\nar X\niv :1\n70 7.\n06 00\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n9 Ju\nl 2 01\n7\nderstanding, reasoning, or composing pose several design challenges centered around the key question: how to make data creation and annotation efforts fun and entertaining in the first place.\nTo tackle this open research challenge, we created Argotario\u2014an online serious game for acquiring a dataset with fallacious argumentation. The main research contributions and features of Argotario include: \u2022 Gamification of the fallacy recognition task\nincluding player vs. player interaction \u2022 Learning by playing and educational aspects \u2022 Full in-game data creation and annotation, all\ndata are under open license \u2022 Automatic gold label and quality estimation\nbased solely on the crowd \u2022 Multilingual, platform independent, open-\nsource, modular, with native look-and-feel on smartphones"}, {"heading": "2 Background and Related Work", "text": "Fallacies have been an active topic in argumentation theory research in the past several decades. While Aristotle\u2019s legacy was still noticeable in the twentieth century, a \u2018fresh\u2019 look by Hamblin (1970) showed that the concept of fallacies as arguments \u2018that seem to be valid but are not so\u2019 deserves to be put under scrutiny.3 Theories about fallacies evolved into various categorizations and treatments, ranging from rather practical education-oriented approaches (Tindale, 2007; Schiappa and Nordin, 2013) to rhetorical ones in informal logic (Walton, 1995) or pragma-dialectic (Van Eemeren and Grootendorst, 1987). For a historical overview of fallacies see, e.g., (Hansen, 2015).\nSurprisingly, the vast majority of current works on fallacies, and especially textbooks, present only toy examples that one is unlikely to encounter in real life (Boudry et al., 2015, p. 432). The distinction between fallacies and acceptable inference is fuzzy and theories do not offer any practical guidance: fully-fledged fallacies are harder to find in real life than is commonly assumed (Boudry et al., 2015). To this account, analysis of fallacies in actual argumentative discourse has been rather limited in scope and size. Nieminen and Mustonen (2014) examined fallacies found in articles supporting creationism. Sahlane (2012) manualy analysed\n3Hamblin (1970) criticized the \u2018standard treatment\u2019 of fallacies widely present in contemporary textbooks as being \u2018debased,\u2019 \u2018worn-out\u2019, \u2018dogmatic\u2019 and \u2018without a connection to modern logic\u2019.\nfallacies in newswire editorials in major U.S. newspapers before invading Iraq in 2003. These two works rely on a list of several fallacy types, such as ad hominem, ad populum, appeal to guilt, slippery slope, hasty generalization, and few others.\nWhen scaling up annotations and resource acquisitions, serious games provide an alternative to paid crowdsourcing. Recent successful applications include knowledge base extension (Vannella et al., 2014), answering quizes related to medical topics (Ipeirotis and Gabrilovich, 2014), word definition acquisition (Parasca et al., 2016), or word sense labeling (Venhuizen et al., 2013); where the latter one resembles a standard annotation task with bonus rewards rather than a traditional entertaining game. Niculae and Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil (2016) built a game for guessing places given Google Street View images in order to collect data for investigating constructive discussions. An important aspect of serious games for NLP is their benefit to the users other than getting the annotations done quickly: learning a language in Duolingo4 has more added value than killing zombies (despite its obvious fun factor) in Infection (Vannella et al., 2014)."}, {"heading": "3 Argotario: Overview", "text": "Architecture and Implementation Argotario is a client-server Web-based application that runs in all modern browsers and seamlessly works on smartphones, providing an authentic look-and-feel. Its three-tier architecture consists of a backend MongoDB database, a Python server behind an Apache2 SSL proxy, and a Javascript client built on top of Ionic framework. Argotario is modular as it allows developers to add new content (worlds, levels, rounds) as independent modules. The game workflow is configurable using JSON files, so it can be customized for evaluating new game scenarios. Security is ensured by a SSL certificate and securely hashing all passwords with salt. Localization utilizes the built-in capabilities of ng-translate so that all texts are stored externally in a JSON file and adding another language to the UI requires only manual translation of these texts.5 Currently, Argotario is available in English\n4Although Duolingo presents itself as a learning tool, its incentives and competition features make it feel like accomplishing quests in a game.\n5Needless to say that providing an initial content for a new language, such as a list of language-dependent topics, arguments, and fallacies, requires substantial manual work.\n(a) A single world with the two first levels finished, the third one about to be played, and other to be \u2018explored\u2019. (b) The recognize fallacy type round. (c) The player vs. player level, now waiting for the opponent\u2019s turn. (d) An example of hard feedback in a fallacy recognition round.\nFigure 1: Screenshots of Argotario taken in a smartphone emulator.\nand German.\nGame Design We first present the abstract architecture; concrete examples follow in \u00a74. According to Salen and Zimmerman (2004, p. 50), a game is a system consisting of different types of interacting entities that have certain attributes. Argotario follows this structure by a hierarchy of worlds, levels, and game rounds (Hannemann, 2015).\nA game round represents an atomic mini-game in which users take an action and are rewarded with points. Conceptually, each game round follows the same procedure: the users are first faced with game data, which they need to interact with. Their response (a choice or free-text input) is then validated with respect to the current game round configuration, similar to form validation on web pages. If the game determines correctness of the response data, it rewards the user with a certain number of points.\nA sequence of game rounds form a level. To complete a level, all game rounds must be finished, independently of whether the user successfully fulfilled the respective task or not. Whereas game rounds can be re-used in different levels, each level is unique and can be individually designed to fit a certain purpose (i.e., only some types of fallacies are dealt with).\nFinally, all levels reside in a world which is a wrapper for all included levels, visually resembling\na treasure map (see Figure 1a). Their look can be freely customized to be visually appealing and capture a certain atmosphere or theme. There are multiple worlds within the game next to each other.\nUsers are represented as small circular comic faces (avatars). The first user\u2019s goal is to finish all levels in all worlds. Initially, the game worlds are covered by a fog, which can be cleared by the user by completing levels. Ranking (score) is the second important game goal. Repeating levels allows users to collect more points and hence improve their global rank."}, {"heading": "4 Gamifying Fallacy Recognition", "text": "The backbone principle of Argotario can be summarized as follows. First, since a fallacious argument is one \u2018that seems to be valid but is not so\u2019 (Hamblin, 1970), users must try to \u2018fool\u2019 other users by writing a fallacious argument of a given type without being revealed that this is in fact a fallacy. By writing a fallacious argument on purpose with the aim to \u2018disguise\u2019 it as a valid argument, users get sensitive to the very gist of fallacious argumentation (such as rhetorical strategies, linguistic devices, logic, etc.). Second, users learn to recognize fallacies in existing arguments\u2014either by revealing the correct fallacy type or stating that the given argument is not fallacious\u2014and get feedback about\ntheir \u2018debunking\u2019 skills (see Figure 1b).6\nIn the serious-game terminology of von Ahn and Dabbish (2008, p. 61), recognizing the correct fallacy type combines the inversion-problem game (the guesser produces the input that was originally given to the describer\u2018) and a modification of the output-agreement game (the guesser has to produce the same output as the crowd; details will be discussed later in \u00a74).\nFallacy Types We gathered an inventory of fallacy types suitable for our game scenarios. Given the breadth and variety of fallacy types (Tindale, 2007; Govier, 2010), we conducted several pilot studies to identify types that are (1) common in everyday argumentative discourse, (2) are distinguishable from each other, and (3) have increasing difficulty.7 The fallacy type inventory in Argotario currently contains ad hominem, appeal to emotion, red herring, hasty generalization, irrelevant authority, and a non-fallacious argument (Pollak, 2016).\nPlayers learn to recognize different fallacy types gradually, as they accomplish each level. After finishing the first world in which all fallacy types are mastered, users can engage in the player versus player world. Here, a dialogue exchange about a given controversy requires users to write fallacious arguments (as in the previous world) and guess which fallacy was used by its opponent (thus getting points for correct answers; details about gold data estimation are explained in the next section). This level is asynchronous; when a user writes a new argument, his opponents gets notification about the turn change, so they do not have to play at the same time (see Figure 1c).\nGold Label Estimation Because all content is created within the game by players with different abilities to write or comprehend argumentation, we treat the data as noisy in the first place. First, spam can be reported in all rounds and is submitted to the admins to take action. Second, we rely on MACE (Hovy et al., 2013) for gold label estimation which we seamlessly integrated to the backend. For example, if the user has to write an argument of a given fallacy type, we treat the type only as a single \u2018vote\u2019 and require another four players to guess the correct type of this fallacy in other levels. Only\n6All written texts and user input are licensed under CC-BY. 7Details are out of scope of this demo paper and will be reported in future works. Briefly, we started our selection by taking the \u2018usual suspects\u2019 from the \u2018gang of eighteen\u2019 (?).\narguments that receive at least five \u2018votes\u2019 are fed into MACE to establish their gold label.\nBy utilizing crowd voting and spam reporting, we indirectly aim for high-quality labels. Predicting gold labels can be further parametrized by a threshold in MACE, which then provides only gold label estimates for instances whose entropy is below the threshold (Hovy et al., 2013, p. 1125). However, a deep analysis of the data quality is on our current research agenda.\nFeedback and Incentives Argotario provides two types of feedback: soft and hard one. For labeling arguments with yet unknown gold label, users get only one point without knowing whether their answer was right (soft feedback). For arguments with already estimated gold labels, hard feedback (see Figure 1d) is given: if the user makes an error, she receives no reward. Apparently, hard feedback is better from the educational point of view as one knows immediately whether her answer was right or wrong; however, users do not know in advance whether a current assessment gives them a soft or hard feedback, so they are inherently encouraged to try their best.\nWe also built in several sorts of incentives to keep the player engaged. First, Argotario shows the overall leaderboard as well as weekly ranks to ensure newcomers have chances to succeed, see (Ipeirotis and Gabrilovich, 2014) for details. Players of the week are publicly shown and receive a small monetary prize. Second, debunking fallacious arguments to familiar topics is reportedly entertaining for players interested in rhetoric, argumentation, or public deliberation, according to user feedback obtained after few classroom runs."}, {"heading": "5 Benchmarking", "text": "So far we tested Argotario in serveral user studies and beta-testing sessions. The first study on early versions of Argotario examined the effect of hard feedback and the lack thereof on overall users\u2019 engagement in the game. We found that the soft feedback has no significant negative impact on the users\u2019 experience8 (Hannemann, 2015).\nIn a subsequent study, we benchmarked the player vs. player level using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). We asked workers to play a specially\n8Two user groups (20 and 17 participants, respectively) with the same game configuration but with either only soft or hard feedback; final questionnaire with Likert-scale questions; Mann-Whitney-U non-parametric test.\nconfigured version of Argotario in order to \u2018win\u2019 20 points required for submitting the HIT. As the player vs. player round needs two dialogue turns of two users and thus two or more people actively participating over a longer period of time, we also implemented a naive bot for this study.9 At the same time, we promoted the game on social media and attracted some non-paid users. Using this process, we could quickly test the entire game mechanism with a larger crowd, identify potential drawbacks, and gather about 1,160 hand-written fallacious arguments. We also experimented with various price per HIT ($1\u2013$2) with respect to average playing time. While the number of rejected low-quality HITs remained negligible for all configurations, we did not observe any correlation between HIT prices and playing times (\u2248 18\u201326 min). Our interpretation is that the HIT price for benchmarking studies should be fair and reflect the study time but does not influence the quality (Pollak, 2016)."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions and Outlook", "text": "Argotario is a serious game that serves several purposes. First, it is a software tool for computational linguistics research, as it focuses on fallacies in argumentative discourse, an important part of qualitative criteria in computational argumentation. Second, it is software supporting learning and education. Its main educational purpose is to raise awareness\u2014not only that fallacies do exist but they might be easily overlooked and misused in everyday argumentation. Finally, Argotario is also a data-acquisition and annotation tool that applies successful techniques for quality estimation from crowd-sourcing approaches. All content is created by users within the game, as opposed to usual annotation tools.\nIn the long run, we expect that Argotario provides a feasible method for data acquisition as compared to standard crowdsourcing. First, a purely monetary-driven perspective is not always the deciding factor of playing additional levels, as shown by Eickhoff et al. (2012). Second, \u2018experts\u2019 from\n9We trained a fallacy classifier system on existing arguments in the database using a Convolutional Neural Network based on GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) and Keras framework, so the bot tried to recognize a fallacy in its opponent arguments during the player vs. player discussion. For generating an answer, it simply looked up an existing fallacy to the given topic. On the one hand, it disobeyed the discourse flow, as it obviously did not coherently respond to its opponent. On the other hand, it allowed us to deploy the game as a HIT on AMT and get a sufficient number of player vs. bot games in a short time.\nthe crowd motivated by the potential for achievement can help engage in participation (Ipeirotis and Gabrilovich, 2014).\nIn the current version, Argotario is still a proof of concept. Its capabilities need to be verified at a large scale in order to reveal patterns in the game dynamics with impact on the overall user experience and quality; these cannot be easily anticipated on small-scale benchmarks (\u00a75). In this regard, any manual intervention (such as spam removal) needs to be automated.\nArgotario is accessible at www.argotario.net along with tutorial videos and runs in any modern web-browser, preferably on smartphones. It is also open-source, source codes under ASL license are available at GitHub.10"}], "references": [{"title": "Designing games with a purpose", "author": ["Luis von Ahn", "Laura Dabbish."], "venue": "Communications of the ACM, 51(8):57.", "citeRegEx": "Ahn and Dabbish.,? 2008", "shortCiteRegEx": "Ahn and Dabbish.", "year": 2008}, {"title": "The Fake, the Flimsy, and the Fallacious: Demarcating Arguments in Real Life", "author": ["Maarten Boudry", "Fabio Paglieri", "Massimo Pigliucci."], "venue": "Argumentation, 29(4):431\u2013456.", "citeRegEx": "Boudry et al\\.,? 2015", "shortCiteRegEx": "Boudry et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Quality through flow and immersion: gamifying crowdsourced relevance assessments", "author": ["Carsten Eickhoff", "Christopher G.
