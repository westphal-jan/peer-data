We study the problem of extraction of Adverse-Drug-Reaction (ADR) mentions from social media, particularly from Twi er. Medical information extraction from social media is challenging, mainly due to short and highly informal nature of text, as compared to more technical and formal medical reports.\nCurrent methods in ADRmention extraction rely on supervised learning methods, which suffer from labeled data scarcity problem.\ne State-of-the-art method uses deep neural networks, specifically a class of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which are LongShort-Term-Memory networks (LSTMs) [6]. Deep neural networks, due to their large number of free parameters relies heavily on large annotated corpora for learning the end task. But in the real-world, it is hard to get large labeled data, mainly due to the heavy cost associated with the manual annotation. To this end, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning based RNN model, which can leverage unlabeled data also present in abundance on social media. rough experiments we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in ADR mention extraction.\nCCS CONCEPTS\n\u2022Information systems\u2192 Information extraction; \u2022 eory of computation\u2192 Semi-supervisedlearning;Unsupervised learning and clustering;\nKEYWORDS\nPharmacovigilance, RNN, LSTM, semi-supervised learning\n\u2217Work done during internship at TRDDC, Pune.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

In a study, it was observed that from a death count in the range of (44,000-98,000) due to medical errors, 7000 deaths occurred due to ADRs.1. Postmarket drug surveillance is therefore required to identify such potential adverse reactions. e formal systems for postmarket surveillance can be slow and under-efficient. Studies show that 94% ADRs are underreported [5].\nSocial media presents a useful platform to conduct such postmarket surveillance, given the large audience and vast reach of such platforms. Such platforms have been used for real-time information retrieval and trends tracking, including digital disease surveillance system [12]. Recent study shows that twi er has 3 times more ADRs reported than were reported through FDA. Out of 61,000 tweets collected, 4400 had mention of ADRs as compared to 1400 ADRs reported through FDA during the same time-period [2]. is makes Twi er a great source for building a real-time postmarketing drug safety surveillance system. However, information extraction from social media comes with its own set of challenges. Some of them are: 1) Short nature of the text (twi er has a 142 character limit), making the language more ambiguous. 2) Sparsity of drug-related tweets 3) Highly colloquial language as compared to more technical and formal medical reports.\nConsider for example the tweets, \u2019Cymbalta, you\u2019re driving me insane\u2019; \u2019@<USER> Ugh, sorry. is effexor is not making me feel so awesome\u2019. In the first tweet, \u2019driving me insane\u2019 and in the second one, \u2019not making me feel so awesome\u2019 are ADR mentions which indicate some level of discomfort in the user\u2019s body. ese tweets clearly show how information extraction from social media suffers from above-mentioned problems.\nRecent work in deep learning has demonstrated its superiority over traditional hand-cra ed feature based machine learning models [8, 11]. However, due to a large number of free parameters, deep learning models rely heavily on large annotated dataset. In the real-world, it is o en the case that labeled data is sparse, making it challenging to train such models. Semi-supervised learning\n1h p://bit.ly/2vaWF6e\nbased methods provide a viable solution to this. ese methods rely on a small labeled data and a large unlabeled data for training.\nIn this work, we present a novel semi-supervised Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) [4] based method for ADR mention extraction, specifically leveraging a relatively large unlabeled data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experimentation on ADRmention annotated tweet corpus [1]. Ourmethod achieves superior results than the current state-of-the-art in ADR extraction from twi er. Our main contributions are :\n\u2022 Wepropose a novel semi-supervised sequence labelingmethod\nbased onRNN, specifically Long-Short-Term-Memory Network [6] which are known to capture long-term dependencies be er than vanilla RNN.\n\u2022 For the unsupervised learning part, we explore a novel\nproblem of drug name prediction given context from tweets.\ne goal is to predict the drug-name which is masked,\ngiven it\u2019s context in the tweet.\n\u2022 For supervised learning, we explore different word embed-\nding initializing schemes and present results for the same. \u2022 We demonstrate that by training a semi-supervised model,\nADR extraction performance can be improved substantially as compared to current methods.\n\u2022 On the twi er dataset with ADR mentions annotated [1],\nour method achieves an F-score of 0.751 surpassing the current state-of-the-art method by 3.01%."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORK", "text": "e problem of ADRmention extraction falls under the category of sequence labeling problem. State-of-the-art method for sequence labeling problem is Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) [10]. ADRMine [16], is a CRF-based model for ADR extraction task. It uses a variety of hand-cra ed features, including word context, ADR lexicon, POS-tag and word embedding based features as input to CRF.\ne word embedding based features are trained on a large domainspecific tweet corpus. e problem with the above-mentioned approach is its dependency on hand-cra ed features, which is time and effort consuming. A Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) network based model is proposed [1] to get around this problem. Instead of using human-engineered features, word embedding based features are passed to a Bi-directional LSTMmodelwhich is trained to generate a sequence of labels, given the input word sequence. State-of-the-art results are achieved, surpassing CRF-based ADRMine results.\nSome recent work also focuses on the problem of Adverse-DrugEvent (ADE) detection [7, 13]. e goal is to identify whether there is an Adverse-Drug-Event mentioned in the tweet based on its textual content."}, {"heading": "3 ADR-MENTION EXTRACTION USING SEMI-SUPERVISED BI-DIRECTIONAL LSTM", "text": "In this section, we present our approach for ADR extraction.

Since\nwe already know the drug name beforehand, it doesn\u2019t need any annotation effort. 2) Supervised learning: In this phase, we use the same bidirectional LSTM model from phase 1 and (re)train it to predict the sequence of labels, given the tweet text."}, {"heading": "3.1 Unsupervised learning", "text": "For this phase, we choose a novel task of drug name prediction from its context in the tweet. For training data, we use a large collection of tweets with exactly one mention of the drug name in them. Since we are predicting the drug name from a tweet which is already present in it, in order to avoid the network to learn a trivial function which maps drug-name in input to drug-name in output without considering the context in account, we mask the drugname in the tweet with a dummy token. For feature-extraction, we use a Bidirectional LSTM model. e model takes as input, a sequence of continuous word vectors as input and predicts a corresponding sequence of word vectors as output. e equations governing the dynamics of LSTMs are defined as follows:\n\u00ae\u0434u = \u03c3 (W u \u2217 \u00aeht\u22121 + I u \u2217 \u00aext )\n\u00ae\u0434f = \u03c3 (W f \u2217 \u00aeht\u22121 + I f \u2217 \u00aext )\n\u00ae\u0434c = tanh(W c \u2217 \u00aeht\u22121 + I c \u2217 \u00aext )\n\u00aemt = \u00ae\u0434 f \u2299 +\u00ae\u0434u \u2299 \u00ae\u0434c\n\u00ae\u0434o = \u03c3 (W o \u2217 \u00aeht\u22121 + I o \u2217 \u00aext )\n\u00aeht = tanh(\u00ae\u0434 o \u2299 \u00aemt\u22121)\n(1)\nhere \u03c3 is the logistic sigmoid function,Wu ,Wf ,Wo ,Wc are recurrent weight matrices and Iu , If , Io , Ic are projection matrices. In a conventional LSTM, the sequence order is from le to right.

It should be noted that, similar to the baseline method [1] we report the performance on the ADR label only. is is because the number of Indication annotations are very less in number6.

For the unsupervised learning phase, we select the task of drug-name prediction given its context.

We experiment with word embeddings trained on different corpus to observe its effect on the end-performance. We experiment with embeddings trained on part of Google News Dataset, which consists of around 100 billion words9. It can be observed that using Google News Corpus trained embeddings degrade the performance by 2.038% in F-score.\nis is due to the fact that these embeddings are trained on a large News Corpus, which is more grammatically sound and formal than the raw social media posts. Conceptually, the shi in the lexical data distribution of the News corpus as compared to tweets containing ADR causes the degradation in performance. We also experiment withword embeddings trained on a largemedical-concept terms related tweet corpus10 [14]. Intuitively, embeddings trained on similar domain (medical in this case) should perform be er, but surprisingly it performs worst amongst all methods. e generic embeddings trained on large tweet corpus captures potentially large variation of semantics and linguistic properties of text and due to the free-style nature of writing on social media, this helps more than domain-knowledge, as captured by medical-domain trained embeddings.\nWe also experimented with a different vocabulary initialization. In our proposed formulation, we construct vocabulary from both unlabeled and labeled corpus, resulting in a larger vocabulary size. When experimented with a restricted vocabulary (only from labeled training data), we observe that the F1-score drops by 0.8%.\nis suggests the use of a larger vocabulary with more coverage in\nsimilar se ings."}, {"heading": "5 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "We present a novel semi-supervised Bi-directional LSTM based model for ADR mention extraction.

pharmacovigilance. We study the problem of extraction of Adverse-Drug-Reaction (ADR) mentions from social media, particularly from Twi\u008aer. Medical information extraction from social media is challenging, mainly due to short and highly informal nature of text, as compared to more technical and formal medical reports. Current methods in ADRmention extraction rely on supervised learning methods, which suffer from labeled data scarcity problem. \u008ce State-of-the-art method uses deep neural networks, specifically a class of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which are LongShort-Term-Memory networks (LSTMs) [6]. Deep neural networks, due to their large number of free parameters relies heavily on large annotated corpora for learning the end task. But in the real-world, it is hard to get large labeled data, mainly due to the heavy cost associated with the manual annotation. To this end, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning based RNN model, which can leverage unlabeled data also present in abundance on social media. \u008crough experiments we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in ADR mention", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
