Not surprisingly, there has been a great deal of work on giving semantics to counterfactuals. Perhaps the best-known approach is due to Lewis [1973] and Stalnaker [1968], and involves possible worlds. The idea is that a counterfactual of the form \u201cif A were the case then B would be the case\u201d, typically written A B, is true at a world w if B is true at all the worlds closest to w where A is true. Of course, making this precise requires having some notion of \u201ccloseness\u201d among worlds.\nMore recently, Pearl [2000] proposed the use of causal models based on structural equations for reasoning about causality. In causal models, we can examine the effect of interventions, and answer questions of the form \u201cif random variable X were set to x, what would the value of random variable Y be\u201d. This suggests that causal models can also provide semantics for (at least some) counterfactuals.\nThe relationship between the semantics of counterfactuals in causal models and in counterfactual structures (i.e., possible-worlds structures where the semantics of counterfactuals is given in terms of\n\u2217A preliminary version of this paper appears in the Proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR 2010), 2010.\n\u2020Supported in part by NSF grants IIS-0534064, IIS-0812045, and IIS-0911036, and by AFOSR grants FA9550-08-1-0438 and FA9550-09-1-0266, and ARO grant W911NF-09-1-0281.\nclosest worlds) was studied by Galles and Pearl [1998]. They argue that the relationship between the two approaches depends in part on whether we consider recursive (i.e., acyclic) models (those without feedback\u2014see Section 2 for details). They reach the following conclusion [Pearl 2000, p. 242].1\nIn sum, for recursive models, the causal model framework does not add any restrictions to counterfactuals beyond those imposed by Lewis\u2019s framework; the very general concept of closest worlds is sufficient. Put another way, the assumption of recursiveness is so strong that it already embodies all other restrictions imposed by structural semantics. When we consider nonrecursive systems, however, we see that reversibility [a particular axiom introduced by Galles and Pearl] is not enforced by Lewis\u2019s framework.\nThis conclusion seems to have been accepted by the community. For example, in the Wikipedia article on \u201cCounterfactual conditional\u201d (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfactual conditional; Sept., 2009), it says \u201c[The definition of counterfactuals in causal models] has been shown to be compatible with the axioms of possible world semantics.\u201d\nIn this paper I examine these claims and the proofs given for them more carefully, and try to settle once and for all the relationship between causal models and counterfactual structures. The first sentence in the statement above says \u201cfor recursive models, the causal model framework does not add any restrictions to counterfactuals beyond those imposed by Lewis\u2019s framework\u201d. It is not clear (at least to me) exactly what this means. Recursive models are a well-defined subclass of causal models. Galles and Pearl themselves show that there are additional axioms that hold in recursive models over and above those that hold in counterfactual structures. Indeed, they show that the reversibility axiom mentioned above is valid in recursive models and is not valid in possible-worlds models. They also show that all the axioms of causal reasoning in the possible-worlds framework that they view as relevant (specifically, axioms that do not mention disjunction, since it is not in their language) hold in recursive causal models. Thus, the only conclusion that can be drawn from their argument is just the opposite to what they claim, namely, that the possible-worlds approach does not add any restrictions to causal reasoning beyond those imposed by causal models, since causal models satisfy all the axioms that counterfactual structures do, and perhaps more.2\nPearl [private communication, 2010] intended the clause \u201cfor recursive models\u201d to apply to counterfactual structures as well as to structural models. However, the notion of a recursive counterfactual structure is not defined either by Galles and Pearl [1998] or Pearl [2000]. In fact, in general, the notion of recursive model as defined, for example, in [Pearl 2000, Definition 7.3.4], does not even make sense for counterfactual structures. I show that, if we focus on the language considered by Galles and Pearl and counterfactual structures appropriate for this language, there is a well-defined subclass of counterfactual structures that can justifiably be viewed as recursive (counterfactual) structures. I then show that precisely the same formulas in this language are valid in recursive causal models and recursive counterfactual structures. Put another way, at least as far as Galles and Pearl\u2019s language goes, recursive causal models and recursive counterfactual structures are equally expressive. Thus, by restricting to recursive counterfactual structures (as Pearl intended), the Galles-Pearl claim is, in a sense, correct (although the\n1The discussion in Section 7.4.2 of [Pearl 2000] is taken almost verbatim from [Galles and Pearl 1998]; since the former is more widely available, that is what I cite in this paper.\n2Although it is not relevant to the focus of this paper, I in fact also do not understand the second sentence in the Pearl quote above. As for the third sentence, while it is the case that reversibility does not hold in counterfactual structures in general, reversibility holds in recursive causal structures as well as more general causal structures, as Pearl and Galles themselves show.\nclaim does not follow from their argument\u2014see below). However, it should be noted that Galles and Pearl\u2019s language cannot, for example, express statements with disjunctive antecedents, such as \u201cif he had chosen a different running mate or had spent his campaign funding more wisely then he would have won the election\u201d. The claim applies only to their restricted language.\nGalles and Pearl try to prove their claims by considering axioms; my proof works at the level of structures. Specifically, I show that a recursive causal model satisfying a particular formula can be effectively converted to a recursive counterfactual structures satisfying this formula, and vice versa. It is actually important to work at the level of structures to prove this claim, rather than working at the level of axioms. I show that the argument that Galles and Pearl give for their claim is incorrect in some significant respects. The problem lies with their claim that axioms involving disjunctive antecedents are irrelevant. As I show, they are quite relevant; a proof of a formula not involving disjunction in the antecedent may need to use an axiom that does. This possibility is illustrated by considering a class of models slightly larger than recursive models. In a recursive model, given a context, there is a unique solution to every equation. In earlier work [Halpern 2000], I showed that there are nonrecursive causal models where every equation has a unique solution. Galles and Pearl\u2019s argument applies without change to causal models where the equations have a unique solution. However, as I show here, these models are actually incomparable in expressive power to counterfactual structures. The reversibility axiom remains valid in causal models where the equations have a unique solution. But, as I show by example, there is a formula that does not involve disjunction that is valid in counterfactual structures but is not valid in causal models where the equations have a unique solution. Not surprisingly, proving that this formula is valid from the axioms requires the use of an axiom that involves disjunction.\nThese results show that the quote from Wikipedia is not quite true. While it is true that recursive causal structures are, in a certain sense, compatible with the axioms of possible worlds semantics, the slightly more general class of causal structures with unique solutions to the equations is not. Thus, in general, the semantics of counterfactuals in causal structures cannot be understood in terms of closest worlds.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I review the causal models and counterfactual structures. The main technical results are in Section 3, which also includes a discussion of the problems with the Galles-Pearl argument. I conclude in Section 4 with some discussion of these results."}, {"heading": "2 Causal models and possible-worlds models: a review", "text": "In this section I review the relevant material on causal models and possible-worlds models."}, {"heading": "2.1 Causal models", "text": "(The following discussion is taken, with minor modifications, from [Halpern 2000].) Causal models describe the world in terms of random variables, some of which have a causal effect on others. It is conceptually useful to split the random variables into two sets, the exogenous variables, whose values are determined by factors outside the model, and the endogenous variables, whose values are ultimately determined by the exogenous variables. The values of the endogenous variables are characterized by a set of structural equations.\nFor example, if we are trying to determine whether a forest fire was caused by lightning or an arsonist, we can take the world to be described by four random variables:\n\u2022 FF for forest fire, where FF = 1 if there is a forest fire and FF = 0 otherwise;\n\u2022 L for lightning, where L = 1 if lightning occurred and L = 0 otherwise;\n\u2022 MD for match dropped (by arsonist), where MD = 1 if the arsonist dropped a lit match, and MD = 0 otherwise;\n\u2022 E, which captures the external factors that determine whether the arsonist will drop a match, or whether lightning will strike.\nThe variables FF , L, and MD are endogenous, while E is exogenous. If we want to model the fact that if the arsonist drops a match or lightning strikes then a fire starts, then we would have the equation FF = max(L,MD); that is, the value of the random variable FF is the maximum of the values of the random variables MD and L. This equation says, among other things, that if MD = 0 and L = 1, then FF = 1. Alternatively, if we want to model the fact that a fire requires both a lightning strike and a dropped match (perhaps the wood is so wet that it needs two sources of fire to get going), then the only change in the model is that the equation for FF becomes FF = min(L,MD); the value of FF is the minimum of the values of MD and L. The only way that FF = 1 is if both L = 1 and MD = 1.\nFormally, a signature S is a tuple (U ,V,R), where U is a finite set of exogenous variables, V is a finite set of endogenous variables, and R associates with every variable X \u2208 U \u222a V a finite set R(X) of possible values for X (the range of possible values of X). A causal model is a pair T = (S,F), where S is a signature and F associates with each variable X \u2208 V a function denoted FX such that FX : (\u00d7Z\u2208(U\u222aV\u2212{X})R(Z)) \u2192 R(X). FX characterizes the value of X given the values of all the other variables in U\u222aV . Because FX is a function, there is a unique value of X once all the other variables are set. Notice that we have such functions only for the endogenous variables. The exogenous variables are taken as given; it is their effect on the endogenous variables (and the effect of the endogenous variables on each other) that is modeled by the structural equations.\nGiven a causal model T = (S,F), a (possibly empty) vector ~X of variables in V , and a vector ~x of values for the variables in ~X, we can define a new causal model denoted T ~X=~x. Intuitively, this is the causal model that results when the variables in ~X are set to ~x. We can think of setting ~X to ~x as an intervention. For example, if T is the causal model for the forest fire described above, where FF = max(L,MD), then TL=0 is the model where the lightning definitely does not occur, so that there is a forest fire if and only if the arsonist drops a match. If T \u2032 is the model where FF = min(L,MD), then T \u2032L=0 is the model where there is no forest fire, since there is no lightning.\nFormally, T ~X=~x = (S,F ~X=~x}), where F ~X=~x is identical to F except that the equation for X is replaced by the equation X = x. The model T ~X=~x describes a possible counterfactual situation; that is, even though, under normal circumstances, setting the exogenous variables to ~u results in the variables ~X having value ~x\u2032 6= ~x, this submodel describes what happens if they are set to ~x due to some \u201cexternal action\u201d, the cause of which is not modeled explicitly.\nIn general, given a context ~u, that is, a setting for the exogenous variables, there may not be a unique vector of values that simultaneously satisfies all the equations in T ~X=~x; indeed, there may not be a solution at all. One special case where the equations in a causal model T are guaranteed to have\na unique solution is when there is a total ordering \u227aT of the variables in V such that if X \u227aT Y , then FX is independent of the value of Y ; that is, FX(. . . , y, . . .) = FX(. . . , y\u2032, . . .) for all y, y\u2032 \u2208 R(Y ). In this case, T is said to be recursive or acyclic. Intuitively, if T is recursive, then there is no feedback; if X \u227aT Y , then the value of X may affect the value of Y , but the value of Y has no effect on the value of X. It should be clear that if T is a recursive model, then, given a context ~u, there is always a unique solution to the equations in T ~X=~x, for all\n~X and ~x, (We simply solve for the variables in the order given by \u227aT .)\nFollowing [Halpern 2000], I consider three successively more general classes of causal models for a given signature S (with a focus on the first two):\n1. Trec(S): the class of recursive causal models over signature S;\n2. Tuniq(S): the class of causal models T over S where, for all ~X \u2286 V , ~x, the equations in T ~X=~x have a unique solution for all contexts ~u;\n3. T (S): the class of all causal models over S .\nI often omit the signature S when it is clear from context or irrelevant, but the reader should bear in mind its important role.\nSyntax and Semantics: In [Halpern 2000], a number of languages for reasoning about causality are considered. The choice of language is significant. As Galles and Pearl already point out, we cannot in any obvious way give a meaning in causal models to counterfactual implications where there is a disjunction on the left-hand side of the implication, that is formulas of the form (A \u2228 A\u2032) B. Thus, our results effectively consider a language with no disjunction on the left-hand side of . As mentioned in the introduction, one of the results of this paper have the form \u201cfor every recursive causal model, there is a recursive causal structure that satisfies the same formulas\u201d, and vice versa. For this result to have any bite, we must choose a reasonably rich language.\nIn [Halpern 2000], I considered a number of languages appropriate for reasoning about causality in causal models. I briefly review two of them here. The languages are parameterized by the signature S . A basic causal formula is one of the form [Y1 = y1, . . . , Yk = yk]\u03d5, where \u03d5 is a Boolean combination of formulas of the form X = x, Y1, . . . , Yk,X are variables in V , Y1, . . . , Yk are distinct, and x \u2208 R(X). I typically abbreviate such a formula as [~Y = ~y]\u03d5. The special case where k = 0 is abbreviated as \u03d5. A causal formula is a Boolean combination of basic causal formulas. Let L+(S) consist of all causal formulas over the signature S . (Again, I often omit the signature S if it is clear from context or not relevant.)\nRoughly speaking, we can think of L+(S) as the language that results by starting with primitive propositions of the form X = x, where X is a random variable in V and x \u2208 R(X), and closing under modal operators of the form [~Y = ~y]. The restriction to primitive propositions of this form is not a major one. Given a propositional language with primitive propositions P1, . . . , Pn, we can define binary random variables X1, . . . ,Xn (i.e., variables whose range is {0, 1}) and identify Xi = 1 with \u201cPi is true\u201d. That is, as long as we can we define structural equations that characterize how a change in one primitive propositions affects the other primitive propositions, taking the primitive propositions to have the form X = x is not a major restriction.\nThe formula [~Y = ~y]X = x can be interpreted as \u201cin all possible solutions to the structural equations obtained after setting Yi to yi, i = 1, . . . , k, and the exogenous variables to ~u, random variable X has\nvalue x\u201d. This formula is true in a causal model T in a context ~u if in all solutions to the equations in T~Y=~y in context ~u, the random variable X has value x. Note that this formula is trivially true if there are no solutions to the structural equations.\nA formula in L+(S) is true or false in a causal model in T (S), given a context ~u. As usual, we write (T, ~u) |= \u03d5 if the causal formula \u03d5 is true in causal model T given context ~u.3 For a basic causal formula [~Y = ~y]\u03d5, we define (T, ~u) |= [~Y = ~y]\u03d5 if \u03d5 holds in all solutions to the equations F ~Y=~y with the values of the variables in U set to ~u. Thus, for example, if \u03d5 has the form X1 = x1 \u2228X2 = x2, then (T, ~u) |= \u03d5 iff every vector of values for the endogenous variables that simultaneously satisfies all the equations in F has either X1 = x1 or X2 = x2.4 We define the truth value of arbitrary causal formulas, which are just Boolean combinations of basic causal formulas, in the obvious way:\n\u2022 (T, ~u) |= \u03d51 \u2227 \u03d52 if (T, ~u) |= \u03d51 and (T, ~u) |= \u03d52\n\u2022 (T, ~u) |= \u00ac\u03d5 if (T, ~u) 6|= \u03d5.\nAs usual, a formula \u03d5 is said to be valid with respect to a class T \u2032 of causal models if (T, ~u) |= \u03d5 for all T \u2208 T \u2032 and contexts ~u in T .\nL+ is the most general language that I consider in [Halpern 2000]. To compare my results to those of GP, who use a more restricted language, I also consider some restrictions of L+. Specifically, let Luniq be the sublanguage of L+ that consists of Boolean combinations of formulas of the form [~Y = ~y](X = x). Thus, the difference between Luniq and L+ is that in Luniq, only X = x is allowed after [~Y = ~y], while in L+, arbitrary Boolean combinations of formulas of the form X = x are allowed. As the following lemma, proved in [Halpern 2000], shows, for reasoning about causality in Tuniq, the language Luniq is adequate, since it is equivalent in expressive power to L+.\nLemma 2.1 [Halpern 2000] In Tuniq and Trec, the language L+ and Luniq are expressively equivalent; for every formula \u03d5 \u2208 L+, we can effectively find a formula \u03d5\u2032 \u2208 Luniq such that Tuniq |= \u03d5 \u21d4 \u03d5\u2032.\nThe equivalence described in Lemma 2.1 no longer holds when reasoning about causality in the more general class T of structures. However, since I focus in this paper on Trec and Tuniq, in the rest of the paper I consider the language Luniq; this suffices to make my points.\n3In [Halpern 2000], following [Galles and Pearl 1998], the context was included in the formula. The definition of (T, ~u) |= X = x given here is intended to be equivalent to that of T |= X(~u) = x. The advantage of having ~u on the left-hand side of |= (which is also the formalism used in [Halpern and Pearl 2005]) is that it enforces the intuition that the context consists of background information that is typically suppressed. It does lead to loss in expressive power, since it is not possible to consider formulas of the form X1(~u1) = x1 \u2227X2(~u2) = x2, where ~u1 6= ~u2. But this turns out to be an advantage\u2014see the next footnote.\n4In [Halpern 2000], truth was defined for formulas of the form [~Y = ~y](X = x), and extended in \u201cthe obvious way\u201d to Boolean combinations; that is \u03d51 \u2228 \u03d52 was taken to be true if either \u03d51 was true or \u03d52 was true. This is equivalent to the approach described above as long as all equations have a unique solution, that is, in Tuniq. However, the two approaches are not equivalent if equations can have more than one solution. The approach suggested here is what is required to make the axioms given in [Halpern 2000] sound in the general case. We do not want to say that X1 = x1 \u2228X2 = x2 is true if X1 = x1 is true in all solutions to the equations or X2 = x2 is true in all solutions to the equations; rather, we want either X1 = x1 or X2 = x2 to be true in all solutions. With the approach given above, it is not clear how to give semantics to formulas such as X1(~u1) = x1 \u2228X2(~u2) = x2 if ~u1 6= ~u2, which is perhaps another good reason for not allowing such formulas.\nAxiomatizations I briefly recall some standard definitions from logic. An axiom system AX consists of a collection of axioms and inference rules. An axiom is a formula (in some predetermined language L), and an inference rule has the form \u201cfrom \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5k infer \u03c8\u201d, where \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5k, \u03c8 are formulas in L. A proof in AX consists of a sequence of formulas in L, each of which is either an axiom in AX or follows by an application of an inference rule. A proof is said to be a proof of the formula \u03d5 if the last formula in the proof is \u03d5. We say \u03d5 is provable in AX, and write AX \u22a2 \u03d5, if there is a proof of \u03d5 in AX; similarly, we say that \u03d5 is consistent with AX if \u00ac\u03d5 is not provable in AX.\nAn axiom system AX is said to be sound for a language L with respect to a class T \u2032 of causal models if every formula in L provable in AX is valid with respect to T \u2032. AX is complete for L with respect to T \u2032 if every formula in L that is valid with respect to T \u2032 is provable in AX.\nConsider the following axioms, taken from [Halpern 2000], modified slightly for the language used here:\nC0. All instances of propositional tautologies in the language Luniq.\nC1. [~Y = ~y](X = x) \u21d2 \u00ac[~Y = ~y](X = x\u2032), if x, x\u2032 \u2208 R(X), x 6= x\u2032. (Equality)\nC2. \u2228x\u2208R(X)[~Y = ~y](X = x). (Definiteness)\nC3. ([ ~X = ~x](W = w) \u2227 ([ ~X = ~x](Y = y)) \u21d2 [ ~X = ~x;W = w](Y = y)). 5 (Composition)\nC4. [X = x; ~W = ~w](X = x). (Effectiveness)\nC5. ([ ~X = ~x;W = w](Y = y) \u2227 [ ~X = ~x;Y = y](W = w)) \u21d2 [ ~X = ~x](Y = y), if Y 6= W .6 (Reversibility)\nThe key axioms C3\u2013C5 were introduced (and named) by Galles and Pearl [1998]. Perhaps most relevant to this paper is the reversibility axiom, C5. It says that if setting ~X to ~x and W to w results in Y having value y and setting ~X to ~x and Y to y results in W having value w, then Y must already have value y when we set ~X to x (and W must already have value w).\nLet AXuniq(S) consist of C0\u2013C5 and the rule of inference modus ponens (from \u03d5 and \u03d5 \u21d2 \u03c8 infer \u03c8).\nTheorem 2.2 ([Halpern 2000]) AXuniq(S) is a sound and complete axiomatization for Luniq(S) with respect to Tuniq(S).\nUsing Lemma 2.1, it is possible to get a complete axiomatization for L+ with respect to Tuniq(S), simply by adding axioms for converting a formula in L+ to an equivalent formula in Luniq. A complete axiomatization for Luniq with respect to Trec(S) is also given in [Halpern 2000]; it requires adding a somewhat complicated axiom called C6 to AXuniq that captures acyclicity. The details are not relevant for our purposes, so I do not discuss C6 further.\n5Galles and Pearl use a stronger version of C3: ([ ~X = ~x](W = w) \u21d2 ([ ~X = ~x](Y = y)) \u21d4 [ ~X = ~x;W = w](Y = y)). The stronger version follows from the weaker version in the presence of the other axioms. (This is actually shown in the proof of Proposition 3.3.)\n6The assumption that Y 6= W was not made by Galles and Pearl [1998] nor by Halpern [2000], but it is necessary. For example, if W = Y , then one instance of C5 would be ([ ~X = ~x;Y = y](Y = y) \u2227 [ ~X = ~x;Y = y](Y = y)) \u21d2 [ ~X = ~x](Y = y). The antecedent is true by C4, while the conclusion is not true in general.\nFinally, a complete axiomatization for L+ with respect to T (S), the class of all causal models, is given. The axioms are similar in spirit to those in AXuniq. In particular, there is the following analogue to reversibility (where \u3008 ~X = ~x\u3009\u03d5 is an abbreviation for \u00ac[ ~X = ~x]\u00ac\u03d5):\n(\u3008 ~X = ~x;Y = y\u3009(W = w \u2227 ~Z = ~z) \u2227 \u3008 ~X = ~x;W = w\u3009(Y = y \u2227 ~Z = ~z))\n\u21d2 \u3008 ~X = ~x\u3009(W = w \u2227 Y = y \u2227 ~Z = ~z)), where ~Z = V \u2212 ( ~X \u222a {W,Y })."}, {"heading": "2.2 Possible-worlds models for counterfactuals", "text": "There have been a number of semantics for counterfactuals. I focus here on one due to Lewis [1973]. Let \u03a6 be a finite set of primitive propositions. A counterfactual structure M is a tuple (\u2126, R, \u03c0), where \u2126 is a finite set of possible worlds,7 \u03c0 is an interpretation that maps each possible world to a truth assignment over \u03a6, and R is a ternary relation over \u2126. Intuitively, (w, u, v) \u2208 R if u is as close/preferred/plausible as v when the real world is w. Let u w v be an abbreviation for (w, u, v) \u2208 R, and define \u2126w = {u : u w v \u2208 R for some v \u2208 \u2126}; thus, the worlds in \u2126w are those that are at least as plausible as some world in \u2126 according to w. Define v \u227aw v\u2032 if v w v\u2032 and v\u2032 6 w v. We require that w \u2208 \u2126w, that w be reflexive and transitive on \u2126w, and that w \u227aw u for all u 6= w. Thus, \u227aw puts an ordering on worlds that can be viewed as characterizing \u201ccloseness to w\u201d, and w is the closest world to itself.\nLet LC(\u03a6) be the language formed by starting with \u03a6 and closing off under \u2227, \u00ac, and (where denotes counterfactual implication). The language LC allows arbitrary nesting of counterfactual implications. By way of contrast, the language L+ and its sublanguages have only one level of nesting, if we think of [ ~X = ~x]\u03d5 as ( ~X = ~x) \u03d5. Let LC1 be the sublanguage of L\nC consisting of all formulas with no nested occurrence of (including formulas with no occurrence of at all).\nWe can give semantics to formulas in LC (and hence LC1 ) in a counterfactual structures M = (\u2126, R, \u03c0) as follows. The first few clauses are standard:\n\u2022 (M,w) |= p, when p \u2208 \u03a6, if \u03c0(w)(p) = true.\n\u2022 (M,w) |= \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8 if (M,w) |= \u03d5 and (M,w) |= \u03c8.\n\u2022 (M,w) |= \u00ac\u03d5 if it is not the case that (M,w) |= \u03d5.\nTo give semantics to \u03d5 \u03c8, assume inductively that we have already given semantics to \u03d5 at all worlds in M . Define closestM (w,\u03d5) = {v \u2208 \u2126w : (M,v) |= \u03d5 and there is no world v\u2032 such that (M,v\u2032) |= \u03d5 and v\u2032 \u227aw v}. Thus, closestM (w,\u03d5) is the set of worlds closest to w where \u03d5 is true. (Notice that if there are no worlds where \u03d5 holds, then closestM (w,\u03d5) = \u2205.)\n\u2022 (M,w) |= \u03d5 \u03c8 if (M,v) |= \u03c8 for all v \u2208 closestM (w,\u03d5).\n7Giving semantics to counterfactual formulas in structures with infinitely many worlds adds an extra level of complexity. As shown by Friedman and Halpern [1994], if a formula in the language I am about to introduce is satisfiable at all, it is satisfiable in a structure with finitely many worlds, so as far as validity goes, there is no loss of generality in restricting to finite structures.\nAxioms: There are a number of well-known sound and complete axiomatizations for counterfactual logic (see, e.g., [Burgess 1981; Bell 1989; Chellas 1980; Grahne 1991; Katsuno and Satoh 1991; Lewis 1971; Lewis 1973; Lewis 1974]). Here is one, based on Burgess\u2019s axiomatization, similar in spirit to the well-known KLM properties [Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor 1990].\nA0.

A5 captures the requirement that \u2126w is nonempty. Finally, A6 is the axiom that makes a counterfactual operator, and not just a \u201cnormality\u201d or \u201ctypicality\u201d operator (so that \u201cnormally birds have wings\u201d becomes bird wing). Suppose that it is the case that if \u03d5 were true, then \u03c8 would be true. Then if \u03d5 is actually true, we would expect \u03c8 to be true. Moreover, if \u03d5 and \u03c8 are both true, then it seems reasonable to assert that if \u03d5 were true, then \u03c8 would be true. On the other hand, it is not in general the case that if \u03d5 and \u03c8 are both true, then \u03d5\u2019s are normally or typically \u03c8\u2019s.\nIn his semantics, Lewis allows there to be more than one world closest to a world w where \u03d5 is true (except in the special case that \u03d5 is true at w; in this case, w is the unique world closest to w satisfying \u03d5). By way of contrast, Stalnaker [1968] essentially assumes that for each world w and formula \u03d5, there is a unique world closest to w satisfying \u03d5. The standard approach to getting uniqueness is to require that w be a strict total order (whose least element is w); that is, for all worlds w\u2032 6= w\u2032\u2032, either w\u2032 \u227aw w \u2032\u2032 or w\u2032\u2032 \u227aw w\u2032.

On the surface, the two approaches are quite different. Consider the causal model for the forest fire example, discussed in Section 2.1. If we want to capture the forest fire using counterfactual structures, perhaps the most natural way to do it is to have worlds in the counterfactual structure that correspond to the eight possible settings of the three exogenous variables (MD , L, and FF ). We can take primitive propositions that correspond to the settings of these variables as well; that is, the primitive propositions have the form MD = i, L = i, and FF = i, for i = 0, 1. The actual world w is the one where MD = 1\u2227L = 1\u2227FF = 1 holds. The closest world relation is described in the obvious way by the equations. For example, if we consider the conjunctive model, where FF = min(MD , L), so that both the match and the lightning are required to start the fire, then the closest world to w where MD = 0 is the one where MD = 0 \u2227 L = 1 \u2227 FF = 0 holds. On the other hand, in the disjunctive model, where FF = max(MD , L), the closest world to w where MD = 0 holds is the one where MD = 0 \u2227 L = 1 \u2227 FF = 1 holds. There is a sense in which the causal model and the corresponding counterfactual structure(s) constructed this way satisfy the same formulas. In this section, I make this intuition precise. More generally, I show that to every causal model in Trec, there is a corresponding counterfactual structure that satisfies the same formulas; however, this is not the case for every causal model in Tuniq.\nGiven a signature S = (U ,V,R), consider the set \u03a6S of primitive propositions of the form X = x for X \u2208 V and x \u2208 R(x). We restrict to counterfactual structures M = (\u2126, R, \u03c0) for this set of primitive propositions, where \u03c0 is such that, for each world w \u2208 \u2126 and variable X \u2208 V , exactly one of the formulas X = x is true. Call such structures acceptable. In an acceptable counterfactual structure, a world can be associated with an assignment of values to the random variables. An acceptable structure (\u2126, R, \u03c0) is full if, for each assignment v of values to variables and all w \u2208 \u2126, there is a world in \u2126w where v is the assignment. (I discuss the consequences of fullness shortly.) Let Ma(\u03a6S) consist of all acceptable counterfactual structures over S; let Mf (\u03a6S) consist of all full acceptable counterfactual structures over S; let M+a (\u03a6S) = Ma(\u03a6S) \u2229M +(\u03a6S); and let M + f (\u03a6S) = Mf (\u03a6S) \u2229M +(\u03a6S).\nAs before, I identify [~Y = ~y](X = x) \u2208 Luniq(S) with the formula ~Y = ~y (X = x) \u2208 LC1 (\u03a6S). I abuse notation and use Luniq(S) to denote the sublanguage of LC1 (\u03a6S) that arises via this identification. The following is easy to show.\nProposition 3.1 C3 and C4 are valid in Ma(\u03a6S); C2 is valid in M+a (\u03a6S); C1 is valid in Mf (\u03d5S).\nNotice that, in Ma(\u03a6S) (and hence all of its subsets), the following two formula schemes are valid:"}, {"heading": "V1. \u2228x\u2208R(X)X = x", "text": "V2. If x 6= x\u2032, then X = x \u21d2 X 6= x\u2032.\nIn Mf (\u03a6S), the following axiom is valid:\nV3. \u00ac[ ~X = ~x]false .\nV3 is valid in a structure where, for all worlds w, there is a closest world to w such that ~X = ~x, that is, closestM(w, ~X = ~x) 6= \u2205, which is exactly what fullness ensures.8\nWith this background, I can give an \u201caxiomatic\u201d proof of Proposition 3.1:\n\u2022 C1 follows easily from A0, A2, A5, and V2.\n\u2022 C3 is a special case of A3.\n\u2022 C4 follows easily from A1 and RA2.\n\u2022 C2 is not provable in AX (and is not valid in Ma(\u03a6S)), but it is provable in AX\u2032 together with the axiom V1. Indeed, it follows easily from A1, A7, RA2, and V1 (since \u03d5 \u21d2 \u2228x\u2208R(X)X = x is valid in M(\u03a6S)). The fact that C2 requires A7 is not surprising. C2 is essentially expressing the uniqueness of solutions, which is being captured by the assumption that there is a unique closest world where the antecedent is true, an assumption captured by A7.\nReversibility (C5) is conspicuously absent from this list. Indeed, as the following example shows, C5 is not sound in counterfactual structures.\nExample 3.2 Suppose that V = {X1,X2,X3}, and R(X1) = R(X2) = R(X3) = {0, 1}. Consider a structure (\u2126, R, \u03c0) \u2208 M+f where there is exactly one world in \u2126 corresponding to each of the 8 possible assignments of values to the variables. Thus, we can identify a world w in \u2126 with a triple (b1, b2, b3), where, in w, Xi = bi. All that matters about R is that (0, 0, 0) \u227a(0,0,0) (1, 0, 0) \u227a(0,0,0) (1, 1, 1), with the other 5 worlds being further from (0, 0, 0) than (1, 1, 1). Then it is immediate that\n(M, (0, 0, 0)) |= [X1 = 1;X2 = 1](X3 = 1) \u2227 [X1 = 1;X3 = 1](X2 = 1) \u2227 [X1 = 1](X2 = 0).\nThus, C5 is violated.\nFor the remainder of this section, fix S = (U ,V,R). Say that a counterfactual structure M = (\u2126, R, \u03c0) in M+f (\u03a6S) is recursive if there is a total ordering \u227aM of the variables in V such that if W \u227aM Y , then for all ~X \u2286 V\u2212{Y,W}, for each world w \u2208 \u2126, in the closest world to w where ~X = ~x and Y = y, the value of W is the same as in the closest world to w where ~X = ~x. Intuitively, setting Y to y has no further effect on the value of W once ~X is set to ~x. Let Mrec consist of the recursive structures in M+f . It is easy to see that the structure M considered in Example 3.2 is not in Mrec. For if it were, then we would have either X2 \u227aM X3 or X3 \u227aM X2. If X3 \u227aM X2, then the value of X3 would have to be the same in the closest world to (0, 0, 0) where X1 = 1 and X2 = 1 as in the closest world to (0, 0, 0) where X1 = 1. But it is not. The same problem occurs if X2 \u227aM X3.\nProposition 3.3 C5 is valid in Mrec.\nProof: Suppose that M = (\u2126, R, \u03c0) \u2208 Mrec, w \u2208 \u2126, and the antecedent of C5 holds at (M,w). If Y \u227aM W , then it is immediate from the fact that (M,w) |= [ ~X = ~x;Y = y](W = w) that we also have (M,w) |= [ ~X = ~x](W = w). Now suppose that W \u227aM Y . Then from (M,w) |= [ ~X = ~x;W = w](Y = y) it follows that (M,w) |= [ ~X = ~x](Y = y). Suppose, by way of contradiction,\n8Galles and Pearl did not discuss the axioms V1\u2013V3, but it is clear that they are implicitly assuming that they hold.\nthat (M,w) |= [ ~X = ~x](W = w\u2032) for some w\u2032 6= w. By C3 (which, by Proposition 3.1, is sound in M ), it follows that (M,w) |= [ ~X = ~x;Y = y](W = w\u2032). This, combined with the fact that (M,w) |= [ ~X = ~x;Y = y](W = w), contradicts C1 (which, by Proposition 3.1, is also sound in M ). (Note that this argument actually shows that the stronger version of C3 used by Galles and Pearl, discussed in Footnote 4, follows from the weaker version used here.)\nNot surprisingly, the proof of Proposition 3.3 is essentially identical to the argument given by Galles and Pearl that reversibility holds in recursive structures. Indeed, it is not hard to show that the axiom C6 that characterizes recursive structures is valid in Mrec, and C5 follows from the other axioms in the presence of C6.\nEven more can be shown. In a precise sense, every causal model in Trec(S) can be identified with a counterfactual structure in Mrec(S) where the same formulas are true. It follows that recursive counterfactual structures are at least as general as recursive causal models. The converse is also true. I now make these claims precise.\nGiven a causal model T = (S,F) \u2208 Trec, we construct a model MT = (\u2126, R, \u03c0) as follows. Let \u2126 consist of all the assignments of values to the variables in U \u222a V . The interpretation \u03c0 is defined in the obvious way: X = x is true in w if w assigns X value x. For each context ~u, let ~v~u be the assignment to the variables in V that is forced by the equations. (Since T \u2208 Trec, ~v~u is uniquely determined.) More generally, for each assignment ~X = ~x, let ~v\n~u, ~X=~x be the assignment to the variables in V determined\nby the equations F ~X=~x in the context ~u. Let w~u = (~u,~v~u) and let w~u, ~X=~x = (~u,~v~u, ~X=~x). Finally, let R be such that the closest world to w~u where ~X = ~x is wu, ~X=~x, and for all assignments ~u and ~v to the exogenous and endogenous variables, respectively, \u2126~u,~v consists of all worlds (~u,~v\u2032) such that ~v\u2032 is an arbitrary assignment to the endogenous variables. This does not uniquely determine R. Indeed, it places no constraints on w if w is not of the form w~u and does not completely determine R even if w does have the form w~u. It is easy to define a relation R that satisfies these constraints such that (1) \u227aw~u is a strict total order on \u2126w~u and (2) for w not of the form w~u, \u227aw is a strict total order on \u2126w that satisfies the recursiveness constraint.\nTheorem 3.4 MT \u2208 Mrec and, for all formulas \u03d5 \u2208 Luniq(S), we have (T, ~u) |= \u03d5 iff (MT , w~u) |= \u03d5.\nProof: It is easy to see that we can take \u227aMT=\u227aT , so MT \u2208 Mrec. Using the definition of R, it is easy to show by induction on the structure of formulas that (T, ~u) |= \u03d5 iff (MT , w~u) |= \u03d5. I leave the details to the reader.\nTheorem 3.4 shows that we can embed Trec in Mrec. I next give an embedding of Mrec in Trec. Now the causal model in Trec depends both on the counterfactual structure and a world in that structure. (I discuss why this is so after Theorem 3.5.) Suppose that M = (\u2126, R, \u03c0) \u2208 Mrec(S) and w \u2208 \u2126. Suppose that V = {X1, . . . ,Xn} and, without loss of generality, that Xi \u227aM Xj iff i < j. Consider the causal model TM,w = (S,F), where FX is defined by induction on the \u227aM -ordering. That is, we first define FX1 , since X1 is the \u227a-minimal variable, then define FX2 , and so on. Suppose that (M,w) |= X1 = x1. Then define FX1 so that, for all contexts ~u and assignments ~v to the variables in V \u2212 {X1}, FX1(~u,~v) = x1. Suppose that we have defined FXi for i \u2264 k. Define FXk+1 so that, for all contexts ~u and all assignments ~v to the variables in V \u2212 {Xk+1}, we have FXk+1(~u,~v) = x iff (M,w) |= [X1 = v1; . . . ,Xk = vk](Xk+1 = x).\nTheorem 3.5 TM,w \u2208 Trec and, for all formulas \u03d5 \u2208 Luniq(S) and all contexts ~u, we have (M,w) |= \u03d5 iff (TM,w, ~u) |= \u03d5.\nProof: It is easy to see that TM,w \u2208 Trec; the definition of F guarantees that \u227aTM,w=\u227aM . The definition of FX is independent of the context; it easily follows that for all contexts ~u and ~u\u2032, we have (TM,w, ~u) |= \u03d5 iff (TM,w, ~u\u2032) |= \u03d5. Again, an easy induction on the structure of \u03d5 shows that, for all contexts ~u, (M,w) |= \u03d5 iff (TM,w, ~u) |= \u03d5.\nIt is easy to modify the construction slightly so that each context ~u corresponds to a different world w \u2208 \u2126. Thus, if the number of contexts is at least |\u2126|, then we can get a closer analogue to Theorem 3.4, where we can associate with each world w \u2208 \u2126 a context ~uw and show that (M,w) |= \u03d5 iff (T, ~uw) |= \u03d5. However, Theorem 3.5 suffices for the following corollary.\nCorollary 3.6 The same formulas in Luniq(\u03a6S) are valid in both Trec(S) and Mrec(S).\nProof: If \u03d5 is not valid in Trec, then there is some causal model T \u2208 Trec and context ~u such that (T, ~u) |= \u00ac\u03d5. By Theorem 3.4, (MT , w~u) |= \u00ac\u03d5, so \u03d5 is not valid in Mrec. For the converse, if \u03d5 is not valid in Mrec, then there is some counterfactual structure M \u2208 Mrec and world w such that (M,w) |= \u00ac\u03d5. By Theorem 3.5, (TM,w, ~u) |= \u00ac\u03d5. Thus, the same formulas are satisfiable in both Trec and Mrec, and hence the same formulas are valid.\nWhat happens if we consider Tuniq rather than Trec? Now causal models and counterfactual structures are incomparable. Consider the formula\n\u03d5 =def [X1 = 1](X2 = 1 \u2227X3 = 0)\u2227 [X2 = 1](X3 = 1 \u2227X1 = 0)\u2227 [X3 = 1](X1 = 1 \u2227X2 = 0).\nTheorem 3.7 \u00ac\u03d5 is valid in Trec and Mf (and hence M + f ), but \u03d5 is satisfiable in Tuniq.\nProof: The validity of \u00ac\u03d5 in Trec follows from its validity in Mf , in light of Corollary 3.6 and the fact that Mrec \u2286 Mf . Nevertheless, I prove the validity of \u00ac\u03d5 in Trec first, since the proof is short and gives some insight. Consider a causal model T \u2208 Trec, and suppose, by way of contradiction, that (M,w) |= \u03d5. Let \u227aT be the total ordering on the variables in V in T . One of X1, X2, and X3 must be minimal with respect to \u227aT . Suppose it is X1 and that (T, ~u) |= X1 = i. Then we must have (T, ~u) |= [X2 = 1](X1 = i) and (T, ~u) |= [X3 = 1](X1 = i). But since (T, ~u) |= \u03d5, it follows that (T, ~u) |= [X2 = 1](X1 = 0) and (T, ~u) |= [X3 = 1](X1 = 1). Thus, X1 cannot be minimal with respect to \u227aT . An analogous argument shows that X2 and X3 also cannot be minimal with respect to \u227aT . Thus, we have a contradiction.\nI next show that \u00ac\u03d5 is valid in Mf . Suppose by way of contradiction that M \u2208 Mf and (M,w) |= \u03d5. Consider a world w\u2032 closest to w that satisfies X1 = 1 \u2228 X2 = 1 \u2228 X3 = 1. (Since M \u2208 Mf , there is guaranteed to be such a world.) Suppose that (M,w\u2032) |= X1 = 1. Note that w\u2032 must be one of the worlds closest to w that satisfies X1 = 1. Since (M,w) |= [X1 = 1](X2 = 1), we must have (M,w\u2032) |= X2 = 1. Thus, w\u2032 must also be one of the worlds closest to w that satisfies X2 = 1. Since (M,w) |= [X2 = 1](X3 = 1), we must have that (M,w\u2032) |= X3 = 1. On the other hand,\nsince (M,w) |= [X1 = 1](X3 = 0), we must have have that (M,w\u2032) |= X3 = 0. This gives a contradiction. A similar contradiction arises if (M,w\u2032) |= X2 = 1 or if (M,w\u2032) |= X3 = 1. Since (M,w\u2032) |= X1 = 1 \u2228X2 = 1 \u2228X3 = 1 by construction, this gives a contradiction to the assumption that (M,w) |= \u03d5.\nFinally, I must show that there is a causal model T \u2208 Tuniq and a context ~u such that (T, ~u) |= \u03d5. Let V = {X1,X2,X3} and let U = {U}. Take R(X1) = R(X2) = R(X3) = {0, 1} and R(U) = {0}. In defining F , I write Fi instead of FXi , and omit the U argument (since it is always 0). Thus, F1(0, 0) = 0 means that when X2 = X3 = 0, then X1 = 0.

This is straightforward, although tedious. First observe that (0, 0, 0) is the only solution to all the equations in the basic causal model. It is easy to see that (0, 0, 0) is a solution. To see that it is the only solution, observe that (0, 0, 1) cannot be a solution because F3(0, 0) = 0; similarly, (0, 1, 0) and (1, 0, 0) cannot be solutions; (0, 1, 1) cannot be a solution because F2(0, 1) = 0; (1, 1, 0) cannot be a solution because F1(1, 0) = 0; (1, 0, 1) cannot be a solution because F3(1, 0) = 0; finally, (1, 1, 1) cannot be a solution because F1(1, 1) = 0.\nIt is clear that there must be a unique solution if we set two of the three variables (forced by the equation for the third variable); for example, if X1 = 1 and X2 = 0, then the unique solution is (1, 0, 0). If X1, X2, or X3 is set to 0, then one solution is (0, 0, 0). The solution is unique for the same reasons that (0, 0, 0) was the unique solution to the original collection of equations. Finally, if X1 = 1, then (1, 1, 0) is a solution; if X2 = 1, then (0, 1, 1) is a solution; and if X3 = 1, then (1, 0, 1) is a solution. We must show that there are no other solutions in all three cases. If X1 = 1, (1,0,0) is not a solution since F2(1, 0) = 1; (1, 0, 1) is not a solution because F3(1, 0) = 0; and (1, 1, 1) is not a solution because F3(1, 1) = 0. If X2 = 1, (0, 1, 0) is not a solution because F3(0, 1) = 1; (1, 1, 0) is not a solution because F1(1, 0) = 0; (1, 1, 1) is not a solution because F1(1, 1) = 0. Finally, if X3 = 1, (0, 0, 1) is not a solution because F1(0, 1) = 1; (0, 1, 1) is not a solution because F2(0, 1) = 0; and (1, 1, 1) is not a solution because F1(1, 1) = 0. Thus, T \u2208 Tuniq.\nIt is now straightforward to check that (T, u) |= \u03d5.\nIn Section 2.1, I argued that the choice of language was significant. All the results of this section are stated for the language Luniq. In light of Lemma 2.1, Theorems 3.4 and 3.5 apply without change to the language L+. Moreover, since Tuniq \u2286 T and Luniq \u2286 L+, the formula \u00ac\u03d5 from Theorem 3.7 (which is in Luniq, and hence also in L+) continues not to be valid in T , while being valid in counterfactual structures. While C5 is not valid in T , the generalization of C5 mentioned at the end of Section 2.1 is valid in T [Halpern 2000], and is not valid in counterfactual structures. So the full class T of causal models is incomparable in expressive power to counterfactual structures with respect the language L+ (which is the language arguably most appropriate for T ). Formally, we have:\nCorollary 3.8 T is incomparable in expressive power to M with respect to the language L+."}, {"heading": "4 Discussion", "text": "I have shown that the expressive power of causal models as models for counterfactuals is incomparable to that of the Lewis-Stalnaker \u201cclosest-world\u201d possible-worlds semantics for counterfactuals; thus, the definition of counterfactuals in causal models is not, in general, compatible with the axioms of possible world semantics, although it is if we restrict to recursive causal models.\nSpecifically, causal models where the equations are recursive can be viewed as defining a strict subclass of the standard possible-worlds semantics. More precisely, a set of structural equation defines a world w (characterized by the unique solution to the equations) and can be implicitly viewed as defining an ordering relation on worlds such that, for every formula ~X = ~x, the solution to the equations when ~X is set to ~x determines a world w ~X=~x that is the world closest to w according to the ordering such that ~X = ~x. Somewhat surprisingly, this is not the case if we go to the larger class of causal models defined by equations that are not recursive, but have a unique solution for all settings ~X = ~x. Of course, it is still the case that there is a world w ~X=~x determined by the equations when\n~X is set to ~x. However, there is, in general, no ordering on worlds such that w ~X=~x is the closest world to w according to the ordering. A closeness ordering on worlds places some restrictions (e.g., those characterized by the formula \u00ac\u03d5 in Theorem 3.7) that do not hold in all causal models in Tuniq.\nSo where does this leave us? It is still the case that, in causal models, a formula such as \u03d5 \u03c8 is true at a world w if \u03c8 is true at some appropriate world w\u2032 satisfying \u03d5. However, w\u2032 cannot be viewed as the \u201cclosest\u201d world to w satisfying \u03d5. This leaves open the question of whether there are other ways of defining \u201cappropriateness\u201d other than \u201ccloseness\u201d. I do not have strong intuitions here, but it is a question that is perhaps worth pursuing. My own feeling is that these arguments show that models in Tuniq \u2212 Trec are actually not good models for causality. It is quite difficult to verify that a nonrecursive causal model is in Tuniq, as the model T given in Theorem 3.7 satisfying \u03d5 shows. I am not aware of any interesting real-world situation that is captured by a model in Tuniq \u2212 Trec. Further evidence of the \u201cunreasonableness\u201d of models in Tuniq \u2212 Trec is given by recent work of Zhang, Lam, and de Clerq [2012]. They show that although the reversibility axiom blocks cycles of counterfactual dependence of length two, it does not block longer cycles. Indeed, they observe that the causal model T of Theorem 3.7 has a cycle of length three.\nDoes this mean that we should restrict to recursive models? There are certainly equations in physics (e.g., those connecting pressure and volume) that exhibit circular dependencies. Perhaps nonrecursive models would be appropriate for them (although once we add time to the picture, we may well be able to use a recursive model to capture any particular scenario). In a general nonrecursive model, there may be several solutions to an intervention (see [Halpern and Pearl 2005, Appendix A.4] for further discussion of this point). But this just corresponds to there being several worlds satisfying a formula \u03d5 that are closest to a given world, which is certainly allowed in Lewis\u2019s framework. I suspect that there is an interesting class of nonrecursive causal models that can be captured in Lewis\u2019s framework, and that these will turn out to be the models that actually arise in practice.\nZhang [2012] makes some progress on this issue. He proposes two condition on causal models, which he calls solution-ful and solution-conservativeness. The former condition is easy to understand: a causal model T is solution-ful if, for every context ~u, the equations have a solution (not necessarily unique). The second condition is somewhat more complicated. T is solution-conservative if, for every context ~u, if a solution to T ~X=~x is consistent with\n~Y = ~y, then every solution to T ~X=~x\u2227~Y=~y is a solution to T ~X=~x. Zhang shows that a causal model satisfies these two conditions iff it satisfies analogues of all\nthe axioms in one of Lewis\u2019s axiomatizations of causal counterfactuals [Lewis 1973, p. 973]. Thus, these two conditions are necessary for a causal model to be translatable to a counterfactual structure. They are not sufficient, since they are satisfied by all models in Tuniq. There is clearly more to be done in understanding the connections between causal models and counterfactual structures.\nTurning to a more technical point, it is worth trying to understand in more detail exactly what goes wrong in the Galles-Pearl argument. When making the comparison, Galles and Pearl did not use the axiom system AX. Rather, they used one of Lewis\u2019 axiomatizations of conditional logic from [Lewis 1973]. Nevertheless, the problem with their argument can be understood in terms of AX. Galles and Pearl show that all but one of the axioms in the system they consider follows from C3, C4, and C5. (They actually also implicitly use C1 and C2, but this is a minor point.) The remaining axiom is\n((\u03d51 \u2228 \u03d52) \u03d51) \u2228 ((\u03d51 \u2228 \u03d52) \u03d52)\u2228 [((\u03d51 \u2228 \u03d52) \u03c8) \u21d4 ((\u03d51 \u03c8) \u2228 (\u03d52 \u03c8))].\nFor this axiom, they say \u201cBecause actions in causal models are restricted to conjunctions of literals that is, in the language of this paper, because in a formula in Luniq of the form \u03d5 \u03c8, \u03d5 is a conjunction of formulas of the form X = x], this axiom is irrelevant.\u201d They thus ignore the axiom. Unfortunately, this argument is flawed. If it were true, then it would be the case that the class of causal models in Tuniq would be less general than counterfactual structures since causal models would satisfy more axioms\u2014all the relevant axioms satisfied by counterfactual structures, and, in addition, C5 (reversibility). However, as we have seen, the formula \u03d5 of Theorem 3.7 is satisfiable in Tuniq, while \u00ac\u03d5 is valid in Mf . The formula \u00ac\u03d5 is equivalent to\n([X1 = 1](X2 = 1 \u2227X3 = 0) \u2227 [X2 = 1](X3 = 1 \u2227X1 = 0) \u21d2 \u00ac[X3 = 1](X1 = 1 \u2227X2 = 0).\nThus, \u00ac\u03d5 is a formula whose antecedent and conclusion are both formulas in Luniq. The argument for the validity of \u00ac\u03d5 given in the proof of Theorem 3.7 is purely semantic, but, as I show in the appendix, \u00ac\u03d5 can also be derived from AX together with V2 and V3. The derivation uses A4 in a crucial way. Note that A4 has disjunctions on the left-hand side of and thus cannot be expressed in Luniq. But it is not irrelevant! Indeed, an easy argument (given in the appendix) shows that \u00ac\u03d5 cannot be derived using AX \u2212 {A4} together with V2 and V3 if we restrict to formulas in Luniq. Thus, we can start with assumptions in the language Luniq, end up with a conclusion in Luniq, but have a derivation that, along the way, uses A4 and has steps that involve formulas with disjunctions on the left-hand side of . The Galles and Pearl argument ignores this possibility.\nAcknowledgments: Thanks to Franz Huber, Judea Pearl, Jiji Zhang, and the anonymous reviewers of the paper for useful comments."}, {"heading": "A A derivation of \u00ac\u03d5", "text": "In this appendix, I show that the formula\n([X1 = 1](X2 = 1 \u2227X3 = 0) \u2227 [X2 = 1](X3 = 1 \u2227X1 = 0) \u21d2 \u00ac[X3 = 1](X1 = 1 \u2227X2 = 0)\ncan be derived from AX together with V2 and V3.

By A4, RA1, and the observation that ((\u03d51\u2227\u00ac\u03d52)\u2228\u03d52) \u21d4 (\u03d51\u2228\u03d52) is a tautology, we can conclude that\n\u22a2 (\u03d52 \u03d53) \u21d2 ((\u03d51 \u2228 \u03d52) (\u03d52 \u21d2 \u03d53)). (2)\nLet \u03c8 be the formula (\u03d51 \u03d52 \u2227 \u03d52 \u03d53). From (1) and (2), it follows that\n\u22a2 \u03c8 \u21d2 ((\u03d51 \u2228 \u03d52) \u03d52) \u2227 (\u03d51 \u2228 \u03d52) (\u03d52 \u21d2 \u03d53)).\nApplying A2 and RA1, it follows that\n\u22a2 \u03c8 \u21d2 ((\u03d51 \u2228 \u03d52) \u03d53,\nas desired.\nNow the proof is easy.

Thus, \u22a2 \u03d5 \u21d2 (\u03c8\u2032 X1 = 0). An analogous argument shows that \u22a2 \u03d5 \u21d2 \u03c8\u2032 X2 = 0) and \u22a2 \u03d5 \u21d2 (\u03c8\u2032 X3 = 0).

Thus, by A1 and RA2, we have that\n\u22a2+ \u03d5 \u21d2 (\u03c8\u2032 (X1 6= 0 \u2227X2 6= 0 \u2227X3 6= 0). (4)\nBy A2, RA1, (3), and (4), we have that\n\u22a2+ \u03d5 \u21d2 (\u03c8\u2032 false).\nBy V3, it follows that \u22a2+ \u00ac\u03d5, as desired.\nNote that all the axioms in AX other than A4 can be expressed using the language Luniq (provided that the formulas \u03d5 and \u03c8 mentioned in these axioms are taken to be conjunctions of primitive propositions or just single primitive propositions, as appropriate). It is easy to check that all these axioms are valid in Tuniq, as are V2 and V3.

Specifically, causal models where the equations are recursive can be viewed as defining a strict subclass of the standard possible-worlds semantics. More precisely, a set of structural equation defines a world w (characterized by the unique solution to the equations) and can be implicitly viewed as defining an ordering relation on worlds such that, for every formula ~ X = ~x, the solution to the equations when ~ X is set to ~x determines a world w ~ X=~x that is the world closest to w according to the ordering such that ~ X = ~x. Somewhat surprisingly, this is not the case if we go to the larger class of causal models defined by equations that are not recursive, but have a unique solution for all settings ~ X = ~x. Of course, it is still the case that there is a world w ~ X=~x determined by the equations when ~ X is set to ~x. However, there is, in general, no ordering on worlds such that w ~ X=~x is the closest world to w according to the ordering. A closeness ordering on worlds places some restrictions (e.g., those characterized by the formula \u00ac\u03c6 in Theorem 3.7) that do not hold in all causal models in Tuniq. So where does this leave us? It is still the case that, in causal models, a formula such as \u03c6 \u03c8 is true at a world w if \u03c8 is true at some appropriate world w\u2032 satisfying \u03c6. However, w\u2032 cannot be viewed as the \u201cclosest\u201d world to w satisfying \u03c6. This leaves open the question of whether there are other ways of defining \u201cappropriateness\u201d other than \u201ccloseness\u201d. I do not have strong intuitions here, but it is a question that is perhaps worth pursuing. My own feeling is that these arguments show that models in Tuniq \u2212 Trec are actually not good models for causality. It is quite difficult to verify that a nonrecursive causal model is in Tuniq, as the model T given in Theorem 3.7 satisfying \u03c6 shows. I am not aware of any interesting real-world situation that is captured by a model in Tuniq \u2212 Trec. Further evidence of the \u201cunreasonableness\u201d of models in Tuniq \u2212 Trec is given by recent work of Zhang, Lam, and de Clerq [2012].

Recursive models are shown to correspond precisely to a subclass of (possible-world) counterfactual structures.
