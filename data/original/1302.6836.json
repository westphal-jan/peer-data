We present an algorithm which computes conditional plans of maximum expected utility. This algorithm relies on a representation of the search space as an AND/OR tree and employs a depth-limit to control computation costs. A numeric robustness factor, which parameterizes the utility function, allows the user to modulate the degree of risk-aversion employed by the planner. Via a look-ahead search, the planning algorithm seeks to find an optimal plan using expected utility as its optimization criterion. We present experimental results obtained by applying our algorithm to a non-deterministic extension of the blocks world domain. Our results demonstrate that the robustness factor governs the degree of risk embodied in the conditional plans computed by our algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:18:53 GMT  (1278kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6836v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["stephen g pimentel", "lawrence m brem"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6836"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6836.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Robust Planning in Uncertain Environments", "authors": [], "emails": ["pimentel@sytex.com", "lbrem@alexandria.adroit.com"], "sections": null, "references": [{"title": "Heuristics: Intelligent Search Strategies for Computer Problem Solving, Addison-Wesley Pub", "author": ["J.
