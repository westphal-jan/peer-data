In theory, rough sets have been connected with matroids [23,25], lattices [4,7,14,26], hyperstructure theory [30], topology [11,12,38], fuzzy sets [10,27], and so on. Rough set theory is built on equivalence relations or partitions. But equivalence relations and partitions are too restrictive for many applications. To address this issue, several meaningful extensions of Pawlak rough sets have been proposed. Among them, Zakowski [35] has used coverings to establish covering based rough set theory. Many scholars [1,2,5,19,20,40] have done deep researches on this theory. Recently, covering based rough set theory gained some new development [6,31,33,36].\nIn covering based rough sets, the neighborhood of an element is the intersection of all the covering blocks containing the element. All the neighborhoods form a new covering called a covering of neighborhoods. Among various types of covering based rough sets, there are some [22,21,32,28,37] defined by neighborhoods. Furthermore, there are many properties [9,15,16,39] of covering based rough sets associated with the properties of coverings of neighborhoods. This makes coverings of neighborhoods be important research subject. Lin [13] augmented the relational database with neighborhoods.\n\u22c6 Corresponding author. E-mail: williamfengzhu@gmail.com(William Zhu)\nYao [32] presented a framework for the formulation, interpretation, and comparison of a specific class of neighborhood systems (called 1-neighborhood systems) induced by binary relations and rough set approximations. By means of consistent functions based on neighborhoods, Wang et al. [24] dealt with the reduction issues on covering decision systems. Many scholars [3,8,21,34] and we studied under what condition a covering of neighborhoods is a partition. In the course of studying this issue, we proposed the concept of repeat degree. With the help of this concept, we addressed this issue as well as the issue that under what condition a covering of neighborhoods is equal to the covering inducing it.\nIn this paper, we study further the application of repeat degree on coverings of neighborhoods. First, we investigate under what condition a covering of neighborhoods is the reduct of the covering inducing it. As a preparation for addressing this issue, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a subset of a set family to be the reduct of the set family. Then we study under what condition two coverings induce a same relation and a same covering of neighborhoods. We prove these two issues are equivalent. Finally, we give the method of calculating the covering according to repeat degree and prove that partial information of repeat degree cannot determine the covering.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the relevant concepts. In Section 3, we introduce the concept of repeat degree and study some properties of it. In Section 4, we first study under what condition a subset of a set family is a reduct of the set family. Then we present a sufficient and necessary condition for a covering of neighborhoods to be the reduct of the covering inducing it. In Section 5, we present a sufficient and necessary condition for two coverings to induce a same relation and a same covering of neighborhoods. In Section 6, we give the method of calculating the covering according to repeat degree.

In this paper, we denote \u222aX\u2208SX by \u222aS, where S is a set family.\nDefinition 1. (Covering) Let U be a universe of discourse and C be a family of subsets of U . If \u2205 /\u2208 C and \u222aC = U , C is called a covering of U . Every element of C is called a covering block.\nIn the following discussion, unless stated to the contrary, the universe of discourseU is considered to be finite and nonempty. Neighborhood [1,13,20,21,24,32] is a concept used widely in covering based rough sets. It is defined as follows.\nDefinition 2. (Neighborhood) Let C be a covering of U . For any x \u2208 U , the neighborhood of x is defined by: NC(x) = \u2229{K \u2208 C : x \u2208 K}. When there is no confusion, we omit the subscript C.\nIt is obvious x \u2208 NC(x) and for any x \u2208 K \u2208 C, NC(x) \u2286 K . The following proposition gives an important property of neighborhoods.\nProposition 1. [24] Let C be a covering of U . For any x, y \u2208 U , if y \u2208 N(x), N(y) \u2286 N(x).\nIf y \u2208 N(x) and x \u2208 N(y), by the above proposition, we have N(x) = N(y). All the neighborhoods induced by a covering of a universe form a set family. This set family is still a covering of the universe. This type of set families have been studied by many scholars [3,8,21,24,34]. However, both the term and the mark of it are not identical. In this paper, we call it covering of neighborhoods and cite the mark proposed by Wang et al. [24].\nDefinition 3. (Covering of neighborhoods) Let C be a covering of U . The covering of neighborhoods induced by C is defined by: Cov(C) = {N(x) : x \u2208 U}.\nAccording to x \u2208 N(x), it is obvious \u222aCov(C) = \u222aC."}, {"heading": "3 Repeat degree and its properties", "text": "In this section, we propose a concept called repeat degree and study the properties of it. Particularly, a relationship between it and neighborhoods is presented. In the following discussion, unless stated to the contrary, for any set family C, \u222aC is considered to be finite and nonempty.\nDefinition 4. (Repeat degree) Let C be a covering on \u222aC and X \u2286 \u222aC. The repeat degree of X with respect to covering C is defined by: \u2202C(X) = |{K \u2208 C : X \u2286 K}|. When there is no confusion, we omit the subscript C.\nFor the convenience of writing, we denote \u2202C({x}) as \u2202C(x). According to the above definition, for any X \u2286 Y \u2286 \u222aC, it follows that \u2202C(X) \u2265 \u2202C(Y ). To illustrate the concept of repeat degree, let us see the following example.\nExample 1. Let U = {1, 2, 3, 4} and C = {{1, 2}, {2, 3, 4}, {3, 4}}. Then \u2202(\u2205) = 3, \u2202(1) = 1, \u2202(2) = \u2202(3) = \u2202(4) = 2, \u2202({1, 2}) = \u2202({2, 3}) = \u2202({2, 4}) = 1, \u2202({1, 3}) = \u2202({1, 4}) = 0, \u2202({3, 4}) = 2, \u2202({2, 3, 4}) = 1, \u2202({1, 3, 4}) = \u2202({1, 2, 4}) = \u2202({1, 2, 3}) = 0 and \u2202({1, 2, 3, 4}) = 0.\nRepeat degree has the following basic property.\nProposition 2. Let C be a covering on \u222aC. For any x, y \u2208 \u222aC, \u2202(x) = \u2202({x, y}) \u21d4 {K \u2208 C : {x} \u2286 K} = {K \u2208 C : {x, y} \u2286 K}.\nProof. (\u21d2): It is obvious {K \u2208 C : {x, y} \u2286 K} \u2286 {K \u2208 C : {x} \u2286 K}. If {K \u2208 C : {x, y} \u2286 K} 6= {K \u2208 C : {x} \u2286 K}, {K \u2208 C : {x, y} \u2286 K} is a proper subset of {K \u2208 C : {x} \u2286 K}. Since {K \u2208 C : {x} \u2286 K} is a finite set, |{K \u2208 C : {x, y} \u2286 K}| < |{K \u2208 C : {x} \u2286 K}|. Thus \u2202({x, y}) < \u2202(x). This is a contradiction to that \u2202(x) = \u2202({x, y}).\n(\u21d0): It is straightforward.\nAccording to the above proposition, we obtain an important relationship between repeat degree and neighborhoods.\nProposition 3. Let C be a covering on \u222aC. For any x, y \u2208 \u222aC, y \u2208 N(x) iff \u2202(x) = \u2202({x, y}).\nProof.

[40] proposed two concepts called reducible element and the reduct of a covering, which have important applications in covering based rough set theory. In this section, we will discuss under what condition a covering of neighborhoods is a reduct. First, we propose a new mark.\nDefinition 5. Let C be a covering on \u222aC. We define I(C) = {\u222aD : D \u2286 C}.\nI(C) has the following simple property.\nProposition 4. Let C be a covering on \u222aC and B \u2286 C. Then I(B) \u2286 I(C).\nProof. For any K \u2208 I(B), we know that there exists some D \u2286 B such that K = \u222aD. It is obvious D \u2286 C. Thus K \u2208 I(C), therefore I(B) \u2286 I(C).\nBased on Definition 5, we introduce the concept of reducible element, which is somewhat different in form from its definition in [40].\nDefinition 6. Let C be a covering on \u222aC. The reducible element family of C is defined by: S(C) = {K \u2208 C : K \u2208 I(C \u2212 {K})}. If K \u2208 S(C), K is called a reducible element of C, otherwise K is called an irreducible element of C.\nThe following proposition presents a simple property of S(C).\nProposition 5. Let C be a covering on \u222aC and B \u2286 C. Then S(B) \u2286 S(C).\nProof. For any A \u2208 S(B), by Definition 6, we know that A \u2208 B\u2227A \u2208 I(B\u2212{A}). By B \u2286 C and Proposition 4, we have that A \u2208 C \u2227A \u2208 I(C\u2212 {A}). Hence A \u2208 S(C). Therefore S(B) \u2286 S(C).\nThe following proposition indicates that deleting a reducible element in a covering will not make any original reducible element become an irreducible element of the new covering.\nProposition 6. [40] Let C be a covering on \u222aC and K1 \u2208 S(C). K \u2208 S(C)\u2212{K1} iff K \u2208 S(C\u2212 {K1}).\nFor the convenience of application, we extend the above proposition.\nProposition 7. Let C be a covering on \u222aC and F \u2286 S(C). K \u2208 S(C) \u2212 F iff K \u2208 S(C\u2212 F ).\nProof. (\u21d2): Let |F | = n. We prove this proposition using induction on n. If n = 1, this proposition follows from Proposition 6. Assume that this proposition is true for n = t. Now assume that |F | = t + 1. For any L \u2208 F , by Proposition 6, we have that K \u2208 S(C\u2212{L}). Let F \u2032 = F \u2212{L}. For any B \u2208 F \u2032, by Proposition 6, we have that B \u2208 S(C\u2212 {L}). Thus F \u2032 \u2286 S(C\u2212 {L}). By K /\u2208 F , we know that K /\u2208 F \u2032. Hence K \u2208 S(C\u2212 {L})\u2212 F \u2032. It is obvious |F \u2032| = t. By the induction hypothesis, we know that K \u2208 S((C\u2212{L})\u2212F \u2032). Since (C\u2212{L})\u2212F \u2032 = (C\u2212{L})\u2212(F\u2212{L}) = C\u2212F , K \u2208 S(C\u2212 F ).\n(\u21d0): By Proposition 5, we have that S(C\u2212 F ) \u2286 S(C). For any K \u2208 S(C\u2212 F ), it is obvious K /\u2208 F . Therefore K \u2208 S(C)\u2212 F .\nBelow we give the definition of the reduct of a covering, which is somewhat different in form from its definition in [40].\nDefinition 7. (Reduct) Let C be a covering on \u222aC. The reduct of C is defined by: reduct(C) = C\u2212 S(C).\nreduct(C) has the following property.\nProposition 8. C \u2286 I(reduct(C)).\nProof. For any K \u2208 C, K \u2208 reduct(C) or K \u2208 S(C). If K \u2208 reduct(C), {K} \u2286 reduct(C). By K = \u222a{K}, we have thatK \u2208 I(reduct(C)). If K \u2208 S(C), reduct(C) \u222a {K} = (C \u2212 S(C)) \u222a {K} = C \u2212 (S(C) \u2212 {K}). By Proposition 7, we have that K \u2208 S(C \u2212 (S(C) \u2212 {K})). Hence K \u2208 S(reduct(C) \u222a {K}). By Definition 6, we know that K \u2208 I((reduct(C) \u222a {K}) \u2212 {K}) = I(reduct(C)). Thus C \u2286 I(reduct(C)).\nBased on the above proposition, we obtain the following proposition.\nProposition 9. Let C be a covering on \u222aC and B \u2286 C. If C \u2286 I(B) and for any K \u2208 B, C * I(B \u2212 {K}), B = reduct(C).\nProof. Suppose reduct(C) \u2212 B 6= \u2205 and A \u2208 reduct(C) \u2212 B. It is obvious A /\u2208 S(C). Thus for any D \u2286 C \u2212 {A}, it follows that A 6= \u222aD. Since B \u2286 C \u2212 {A}, A 6= \u222aF for any F \u2286 B. Hence A /\u2208 I(B). Thus C * I(B). It is contradictory. Therefore reduct(C) \u2286 B. Suppose B \u2212 reduct(C) 6= \u2205 and L \u2208 B \u2212 reduct(C). It is obvious reduct(C) \u2286 B \u2212 {L}. By Proposition 8 and Proposition 4, we have that C \u2286 I(reduct(C)) \u2286 I(B \u2212 {L}). It is contradictory. Thus B \u2212 reduct(C) = \u2205. Hence B \u2286 reduct(C). Therefore B = reduct(C).\nAccording to Propositions 8 and 9, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a subset of a set family to be the reduct of the family.\nTheorem 1. Let C be a covering on \u222aC and B \u2286 C. B = reduct(C) iff C \u2286 I(B) and for any K \u2208 B, C * I(B \u2212 {K}).\nProof. (\u21d2): By Proposition 8, we have that C \u2286 I(reduct(C)) = I(B). For any K \u2208 reduct(C), we know that K /\u2208 I(C \u2212 {K}). By (reduct(C) \u2212 {K}) \u2286 (C \u2212 {K}) and Proposition 4, we have that K /\u2208 I(reduct(C)\u2212 {K}) = I(B \u2212 {K}).\n(\u21d0): It follows from Proposition 9.\nConsidering both the concepts of reduct and covering of neighborhoods, we have the following proposition.\nProposition 10. reduct(Cov(C)) = Cov(C).\nProof. By Definition 7, we need to prove only S(Cov(C)) = \u2205. We use the proof by contradiction. Suppose S(Cov(C)) 6= \u2205 and N(x) \u2208 S(Cov(C)), where x \u2208 \u222aC. By Definition 6, we know that there exists some D \u2286 Cov(C) \u2212 {N(x)} such that N(x) = \u222aD. Thus x \u2208 \u222aD. Then there exists some N(y) \u2208 D such that x \u2208 N(y). By Proposition 1, we have that N(x) \u2286 N(y). But byN(y) \u2208 D \u2286 Cov(C)\u2212{N(x)}, we have that N(y) \u2282 N(x). It is contradictory.\nFor obtaining a necessary and sufficient condition for a covering of neighborhoods to be a reduct, we propose the following concept.\nDefinition 8. Let C be a covering on \u222aC. For any x \u2208 \u222aC, we define \u0393C(x) by: \u0393C(x) = {K \u2208 C : x \u2208 K \u2227 \u2200y(y \u2208 K \u2192 \u2202C({x, y}) = \u2202C(x))}. When there is no confusion, we omit the subscript C.\nTo illustrate the above definition, let us see an example.\nExample 2. Let C = {{1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {3, 4}}. Then \u0393C(1) = \u0393C(2) = {{1, 2}}, \u0393C(4) = {{3, 4}}, \u0393C(3) = \u2205 and {1, 2, 3} /\u2208 \u0393C(1) \u222a \u0393C(2) \u222a \u0393C(3) \u222a \u0393C(4).\n\u0393C(x) has the following property.\nProposition 11. |\u0393C(x)| \u2264 1.\nProof. Let K1 \u2208 \u0393C(x), K2 \u2208 \u0393C(x) and y \u2208 K1. By Definition 8, we know that \u2202C({x, y}) = \u2202C(x). By Proposition 2, we have that {K \u2208 C : x \u2208 K} = {K \u2208 C : {x, y} \u2286 K}. Since x \u2208 K2, K2 \u2208 {K \u2208 C : x \u2208 K}. Hence K2 \u2208 {K \u2208 C : {x, y} \u2286 K}, then {x, y} \u2286 K2, thus y \u2208 K2. Hence K1 \u2286 K2. Similarly, K2 \u2286 K1. Therefore K1 = K2. Hence |\u0393C(x)| \u2264 1.\nBy the above proposition, we obtain the following corollary.\nCorollary 1. If \u0393C(x) 6= \u2205, \u222a\u0393C(x) \u2208 C.\nThe following proposition gives a relationship between \u0393C(x) and NC(x).\nProposition 12. If \u0393C(x) 6= \u2205, \u222a\u0393C(x) = NC(x).\nProof. Let x \u2208 A \u2208 C and y \u2208 \u222a\u0393C(x). By Definition 8, we know that \u2202C({x, y}) = \u2202C(x). By Proposition 2, we have that {K \u2208 C : x \u2208 K} = {K \u2208 C : {x, y} \u2286 K}. Since A \u2208 {K \u2208 C : x \u2208 K}, A \u2208 {K \u2208 C : {x, y} \u2286 K}. Hence {x, y} \u2286 A, thus y \u2208 A. Therefore \u222a\u0393C(x) \u2286 A. By Definition 8 and Corollary 1, we know that \u222a\u0393C(x) \u2208 {K \u2208 C : x \u2208 K}. Therefore \u222a\u0393C(x) = \u2229{K \u2208 C : x \u2208 K} = NC(x).\nBased on the above proposition, we have the following proposition.\nProposition 13. NC(x) \u2208 C iff \u0393C(x) 6= \u2205.\nProof. (\u21d2): We use the proof by contradiction. Suppose \u0393C(x) = \u2205. For any K \u2208 {L \u2208 C : x \u2208 L}, it is obvious there exists some y \u2208 K such that \u2202C({x, y}) 6= \u2202C(x). By Proposition 3, we know that y /\u2208 NC(x). Thus K 6= NC(x). Hence NC(x) /\u2208 {L \u2208 C : x \u2208 L}. Since x \u2208 NC(x), NC(x) /\u2208 C. It is a contradiction to the hypothesis.\n(\u21d0): It follows from Proposition 12 and Corollary 1.\nFor obtaining and proving a necessary and sufficient condition for a covering of neighborhoods to be a reduct, we need the following simple property of neighborhoods.\nProposition 14. C \u2286 I(Cov(C)).\nProof. For any K \u2208 C and any x \u2208 K , we have that {x} \u2286 NC(x) \u2286 K . Then \u222ax\u2208K{x} \u2286 \u222ax\u2208KNC(x) \u2286 \u222ax\u2208KK . Thus K \u2286 \u222ax\u2208KNC(x) \u2286 K . Hence K = \u222ax\u2208KNC(x). Therefore C \u2286 I(Cov(C)).\nBased on some above propositions, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a covering of neighborhoods to be a reduct.\nTheorem 2. Cov(C) = reduct(C) iff for any x \u2208 \u222aC, \u0393C(x) 6= \u2205.\nProof. (\u21d2): We use the proof by contradiction. Suppose there exists some x \u2208 \u222aC such that \u0393C(x) = \u2205. By Proposition 13, we know that NC(x) /\u2208 C. Thus Cov(C) 6= reduct(C).\n(\u21d0): By Proposition 13, we know that Cov(C) \u2286 C. For any NC(x), by Proposition 10, we know that NC(x) /\u2208 I(Cov(C) \u2212 {NC(x)}). Since NC(x) \u2208 C, C * I(Cov(C)\u2212{NC(x)}). Again by Proposition 14 and Theorem 1, we know that Cov(C) = reduct(C)."}, {"heading": "5 A condition for two coverings to induce a same relation and a same covering of neighborhoods", "text": "In [29], a binary relation induced by a covering was proposed to establish the relationship between the relation based rough sets and the first type of covering based rough sets.

(Relation induced by a covering [29]) Let C be a covering of \u222aC. The relation induced by C is defined by: R(C) = {(x, y) : x \u2208 \u222aC \u2227 y \u2208 NC(x)}.\nTo illustrate the above definition and that two different coverings can induce a same relation, let us see an example.\nExample 3. Let U = {1, 2, 3},C1 = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3}}andC2 = {{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3}}. Then NC1(1) = NC2(1) = {1, 2}, NC1(2) = NC2(2) = {2} and NC1(3) = NC2(3) = {3}. Thus R(C1) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 3)} = R(C2).\nBy Definitions 9 and 10, we obtain the following simple proposition.\nProposition 15. SR(C)(x) = NC(x).\nProof. y \u2208 SR(C)(x) \u21d4 (x, y) \u2208 R(C) \u21d4 y \u2208 NC(x).\nBy the above proposition, we obtain the following simple proposition.\nProposition 16. Let C1 and C2 be two coverings on U . R(C1) = R(C2) iff for any x \u2208 U , NC1(x) = NC2(x).\nProof. R(C1) = R(C2) \u21d4 \u2200x(x \u2208 U \u2192 SR(C1)(x) = SR(C2)(x)) \u21d4 \u2200x(x \u2208 U \u2192 NC1(x) = NC2(x)).\nBelow we discuss the condition for the neighborhoods of a same element in different coverings to be equal. First, we propose a definition based on repeat degree as follows.\nDefinition 11. Let C be a covering on \u222aC and x \u2208 \u222aC. A mapping PC : \u222aC \u2192 2\u222aC is defined by: PC(x) = {y \u2208 \u222aC : \u2202({x, y}) = \u2202(x)}.\nPC(x) has the following property.\nProposition 17. NC(x) = PC(x).\nProof. By Proposition 3 and Definitions 11, we have that y \u2208 NC(x) \u21d4 \u2202({x, y}) = \u2202(x) \u21d4 y \u2208 PC(x).\nBy this proposition, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for two coverings to induce a some relation.\nTheorem 3. Let C1 and C2 be two coverings on U . R(C1) = R(C2) iff for any x \u2208 U , PC1(x) = PC2(x).\nProof. By Propositions 16 and 17, we have that R(C1) = R(C2) \u21d4 \u2200x(x \u2208 U \u2192 NC1(x) = NC2(x)) \u21d4 \u2200x(x \u2208 U \u2192 PC1(x) = PC2(x)).\nIn Example 3, we see that C1 6= C2 but Cov(C1) = Cov(C2). Below we discuss the condition for two coverings to induce a same covering of neighborhoods. First, we have the following proposition.\nProposition 18. Let C1 and C2 be two coverings on U . Cov(C1) = Cov(C2) iff for any x \u2208 U , NC1(x) = NC2(x).\nProof. (\u21d2): Let Cov(C1) = Cov(C2) = {K1,K2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Kt}. We use the proof by contradiction. Suppose there exist some 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 t and x \u2208 U such that NC1(x) = Ki and NC2(x) = Kj , where Ki 6= Kj . It is obvious x \u2208 Ki and x \u2208 Kj . By NC2(x) 6= Ki, we know that there exists some w \u2208 U \u2212 {x} such that NC2(w) = Ki. By Proposition 1, we have that NC2(x) \u2282 NC2(w). Thus Kj \u2282 Ki. By NC1(x) 6= Kj , we know that there exists some y \u2208 U\u2212{x} such that NC1(y) = Kj . By Proposition 1, we have that NC1(x) \u2282 NC1(y). Thus Ki \u2282 Kj . It is contradictory.\n(\u21d0): It is straightforward.\nBased some above propositions, we obtain a condition for different coverings to induce a same relation and a same covering of neighborhoods.\nTheorem 4. Let C1 and C2 be two coverings on U . Then the following statements are equivalent: (1) For any x \u2208 U , PC1(x) = PC2(x), (2) R(C1) = R(C2), (3) Cov(C1) = Cov(C2).\nProof. (1) \u21d4 (2): It has been proved in Theorem 3. (1) \u21d4 (3): It follows from Proposition 17 and Proposition 18.\nIn the end of this section, we give the following theorem.\nTheorem 5. Cov(C) = {PC(x) : x \u2208 \u222aC}.\nProof. It follows from Definition 3 and Proposition 17.\nThe difference between defining Cov(C) by {N(x) : x \u2208 \u222aC} and defining Cov(C) by {PC(x) : x \u2208 \u222aC} will be clear after we see the difficulty of calculating the covering by repeat degree of partial subsets in the following section."}, {"heading": "6 Calculating the covering by repeat degree", "text": "Given a set family C, we can calculate the repeat degree of any subset of \u222aC. Conversely, can we calculate the covering by repeat degree of all even partial subsets? In this section, we will discuss this issue.\nDefinition 12. Let C be a covering on \u222aC and X \u2286 \u222aC. We use \u03c1C(X) = 1 and \u03c1C(X) = 0 to express that X \u2208 C and X /\u2208 C, respectively. When there is no confusion, we omit the subscript C.\nFor the convenience of writing, we denote \u03c1C({x}) as \u03c1C(x). To illustrate this definition, let us see an example.\nExample 4. Let C = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}}.Then \u03c1(\u2205) = \u03c1(1) = \u03c1(2) = \u03c1(3) = \u03c1({1, 3}) = \u03c1({1, 2, 3}) = 0 and \u03c1({1, 2}) = \u03c1({2, 3}) = 1.\nBy Definition 4 and Definition 12, the following proposition holds obviously.\nProposition 19. \u2202C(Y ) = \u03a3Y\u2286X\u2286\u222aC\u03c1C(X).\nParticularly, we have that \u2202C(\u222aC) = \u03c1C(\u222aC).\nDefinition 13. Let C be a covering on \u222aC. We define \u03b4(C) = {(X, \u03c1C(X)) : X \u2286 \u222aC \u2227X 6= \u2205}.\nTo illustrate this definition, let us see an example.\nExample 5. Let C = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}}.Then \u03b4(C) = {({1}, 0), ({2}, 0), ({3}, 0), ({1, 2 }, 1), ({2, 3}, 1), ({1, 3}, 0), ({1, 2, 3}, 0)}.\nThe following two propositions indicate that \u03b4 is a bijection.\nProposition 20. If C1 6= C2, \u03b4(C1) 6= \u03b4(C2).\nProof. It is obvious C1 \u2212 C2 6= \u2205 or C2 \u2212 C1 6= \u2205. Without loss of generality, suppose C1 \u2212 C2 6= \u2205 and K \u2208 C1 \u2212 C2. Then (K, 1) \u2208 \u03b4(C1) \u2212 \u03b4(C2). Hence \u03b4(C1) 6= \u03b4(C2).\nProposition 21. Let U be a finite and nonempty set. For any {(X, f(X)) : X \u2286 U \u2227 X 6= \u2205}, where f(X) \u2208 {0, 1}, there exists a set family C such that {(X, f(X)) : X \u2286 U \u2227X 6= \u2205} = \u03b4(C).\nProof. Let C = {K \u2286 U : X 6= \u2205\u2227f(K) = 1}. Then {(X, f(X)) : X \u2286 U} = \u03b4(C).\nWe give a new concept as follows.\nDefinition 14. Let C be a covering on \u222aC, | \u222a C| = n and W \u2286 {0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n}. We define DC(W ) = {(X, \u2202C(X)) : X \u2286 \u222aC \u2227 |X | \u2208 W}. When there is no confusion, we omit the subscript C. Particularly, DC({1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n}) is written as D(C) for short.\nBy the above definition, we have the following proposition.\nProposition 22. Let C1 be a covering on \u222aC1 and C2 be a covering on \u222aC2. If C1 6= C2, D(C1) 6= D(C2).\nProof. We use the proof by contradiction. Suppose D(C1) = D(C2). Then \u222aC1 = \u222aC2. Let U = \u222aC1 = \u222aC2 and |U | = n. For any K \u2286 U , we claim that \u03c1C1(K) = \u03c1C2(K). We prove this assertion using induction on n\u2212 |K|. If n\u2212 |K| = 0, K = U . Thus \u03c1C1(U) = \u2202C1(U) = \u2202C2(U) = \u03c1C2(U). Assume this assertion is true for n\u2212|K| \u2264 t\u22121. Now assume n\u2212|K| = t. By Proposition 19, we have that \u03c1C1(K) = \u2202C1(K) \u2212 \u03a3K\u2282X\u2286\u222aC\u03c1C1(X) = \u2202C2(K) \u2212 \u03a3K\u2282X\u2286\u222aC\u03c1C2(X) = \u03c1C2(K). Hence \u03b4(C1) = \u03b4(C2). By Proposition 20, we have that C1 = C2. It is contradictory.\nBelow we give a method of calculating the covering by repeat degree. In fact, we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 6. Let U be a finite and nonempty set. Let for any Y \u2286 U , mappings f : 2U \u2192 R and g : 2U \u2192 R satisfy f(Y ) = \u03a3Y\u2286X\u2286Ug(X). Then for any V \u2286 U , g(V ) = \u03a3V\u2286Z\u2286U ((\u22121)|Z|\u2212|V |f(Z)).\nProof. Let |U | \u2212 |V | = k. We prove this assertion using induction on k. By f(Y ) = \u03a3Y\u2286X\u2286Ug(X), we have that f(U) = g(U). Thus this assertion is true for k = 0. Assume this assertion is true for k \u2264 t \u2212 1. Now assume k = t. Let Z \u2286 U such that V \u2282 Z . Let V (i) = {X \u2286 U |V \u2282 X \u2227 |X | \u2212 |V | = i} and Z(i) = {H \u2208 V (i)|H \u2286 Z}. We have that |Z(i)| = Ci|Z|\u2212|V |. For any V \u2282 X \u2286 U , it is obvious |U |\u2212 |X | \u2264 t\u22121. By the assumption of the induction and \u03a3ni=0(\u22121) iCin = 0, we have that\nf(V ) = \u03a3V\u2286X\u2286Ug(X)\n= g(V ) +\u03a3V\u2282X\u2286Ug(X)\n= g(V ) +\u03a3V\u2282X\u2286U\u03a3X\u2286Z\u2286U (\u22121)|Z|\u2212|X|f(Z)\n= g(V ) +\u03a3ki=1(\u03a3V\u2282Z\u2286U (\u22121) |Z|\u2212|V |\u2212iCi|Z|\u2212|V |f(Z))\n= g(V ) +\u03a3V\u2282Z\u2286U (f(Z)\u03a3 k i=1(\u22121) |Z|\u2212|V |\u2212iCi|Z|\u2212|V |)\n= g(V ) +\u03a3V \u2282Z\u2286U ((\u22121)|Z|\u2212|V |\u22121f(Z)).\nThus\ng(V ) = f(V )\u2212\u03a3V \u2282Z\u2286U ((\u22121)|Z|\u2212|V |\u22121f(Z))\n= f(V ) +\u03a3V \u2282Z\u2286U ((\u22121)|Z|\u2212|V |f(Z))\n= \u03a3V \u2286Z\u2286U (\u22121)|Z|\u2212|V |f(Z).\nBy the above theorem and Proposition 19, we have the following corollary.\nCorollary 2. \u03c1C(V ) = \u03a3V \u2286Z\u2286U ((\u22121)|Z|\u2212|V |\u2202C(Z)).\nGiven a D(C), by the above corollary, we can calculate the \u03b4(C). Again by Proposition 21, we obtain C. On the other hand, let C1 and C2 be two coverings on U and |U | = n. If W \u2282 {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n}, C1 6= C2 does not imply DC1(W ) 6= DC1(W ). To illustrate this, let us see an example.\nExample 6. Let C1 = {{a, b}, {b, c}, {a, c}} and C2 = {{a, b, c}, {a}, {b}, {c}}. ThenDC1({1, 2}) = {({a}, 2), ({b}, 2), ({c}, 2), ({a, b}, 1), ({b, c}, 1), ({a, c}, 1)}= DC2({1, 2}).\nIn fact, we have the following proposition, in which we denote |X | as Card(X).\nProposition 23. Let C1 and C2 be two coverings on U and Card(U) = n > 1. C1 6= C2 and DC1({1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n \u2212 1}) = DC2({1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n \u2212 1}) iff {C1,C2} = {{X \u2286 U : 2|Card(X)}, {X \u2286 U : 2 \u2224 Card(X)}}.\nProof. (\u21d2): Suppose \u2202C1(U) = \u2202C2(U). ThenD(C1) = {(U, \u2202C1(U))}\u222aDC1({1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n \u2212 1}) = {(U, \u2202C2(U))} \u222a DC2({1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n \u2212 1}) = D(C2). By Proposition 22, we have that C1 = C2. It is contradictory. Thus \u2202C1(U) 6= \u2202C2(U). Without loss of generality, suppose \u2202C1(U) = 0 and \u2202C2(U) = 1. It is obvious \u03c1C1(U) = 0 and \u03c1C2(U) = 1. For any X \u2286 U , let Card(U) \u2212 Card(X) = k. We claim that X \u2208 C1 iff 2 \u2224 k and X \u2208 C2 iff 2|k. We prove this assertion using induction on k. If k = 1, by Proposition 19, we have that \u2202C1(X) = \u03c1C1(X) + \u03c1C1(U) \u2264 1 and \u2202C2(X) = \u03c1C2(X) + \u03c1C2(U) \u2265 1. Thus \u2202C1(X) = \u2202C2(X) = 1, \u03c1C1(X) = 1 and \u03c1C2(X) = 0. Hence X \u2208 C1 and X /\u2208 C2. If k = 2, by Proposition 19, we have that \u2202C1(X) = \u03c1C1(X) + \u03a3X\u2282Y\u2286\u222aC\u03c1C1(Y ) = \u03c1C1(X) + C 1 2 = \u03c1C1(X) + 2 \u2265 2 and \u2202C2(X) = \u03c1C2(X) + \u03c1C2(U) = \u03c1C2(X) + 1 \u2264 2. Thus \u2202C1(X) = \u2202C2(X) = 2, \u03c1C1(X) = 0 and \u03c1C2(X) = 1. Hence X /\u2208 C1 and X \u2208 C2. Assume this assertion is true for k \u2264 t \u2212 1. Now assume k = t. It is obvious 2|t or 2 \u2224 t. If 2|t, by Proposition 19 and the assumption of the induction, we have that \u2202C1(X) = \u03c1C1(X) + \u03a3X\u2282Y\u2286\u222aC\u03c1C1(Y ) = \u03c1C1(X) + \u03a3 t 2 i=1C 2i\u22121 t and \u2202C2(X) = \u03c1C2(X) + \u03a3X\u2282Y\u2286\u222aC\u03c1C2(Y ) = \u03c1C2(X) + \u03a3 t 2 i=1C 2i t . By \u03a3 t 2 i=1C 2i t = \u03a3 t 2 i=1C 2i\u22121 t \u2212 1 and \u2202C1(X) = \u2202C2(X), we have that \u03c1C2(X) \u2212 \u03c1C1(X) = 1. Hence \u03c1C1(X) = 0 and \u03c1C2(X) = 1. Therefore X /\u2208 C1 and X \u2208 C2. If 2 \u2224 t, by Proposition 19 and the assumption of the induction, we have that \u2202C1(X) = \u03c1C1(X)+\u03a3X\u2282Y\u2286\u222aC\u03c1C1(Y ) = \u03c1C1(X) + \u03a3 t\u22121 2 i=1 C 2i t and \u2202C2(X) = \u03c1C2(X) + \u03a3X\u2282Y\u2286\u222aC\u03c1C2(Y ) = \u03c1C2(X) + \u03a3 t+1 2\ni=1C 2i\u22121 t . By \u03a3\nt\u22121\n2 i=1 C 2i t = \u03a3\nt+1\n2 i=1C 2i\u22121 t \u2212 1 and \u2202C1(X) = \u2202C2(X), we have that\n\u03c1C1(X) \u2212 \u03c1C2(X) = 1. Hence \u03c1C1(X) = 1 and \u03c1C2(X) = 0. Therefore X \u2208 C1 and X /\u2208 C2.\n(\u21d0): Without loss of generality, suppose C1 = {X \u2286 U : 2 \u2224 Card(X)} and C2 = {X \u2286 U : 2|Card(X)}. It is obvious C1 6= C2. Let X \u2282 U and |X | = t. It is obvious 2|t or 2 \u2224 t. If 2|t, \u2202C1(X) = \u03a3 [n\u2212t\u22121 2 ] i=0 C 2i+1 n\u2212t and \u2202C2(X) = \u03a3 [n\u2212t 2 ]\ni=0 C 2i n\u2212t. If 2 \u2224 t, \u2202C1(X) = \u03a3\n[n\u2212t 2 ] i=0 C 2i n\u2212t and \u2202C2(X) = \u03a3 [n\u2212t\u22121 2 ] i=0 C 2i+1 n\u2212t . Since\n\u03a3 [n\u2212t\u22121 2 ]\ni=0 C 2i+1 n\u2212t = \u03a3\n[n\u2212t 2 ] i=0 C 2i n\u2212t, \u2202C1(X) = \u2202C2(X). Thus DC1({1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n\u2212 1}) =\nDC1({1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n\u2212 1}).\nBy the above proposition, we know that partial information of repeat degree cannot determine the covering. In order to calculate the covering by repeat degree, we have to know D(C). It is obvious PC(x) depends on only DC({1, 2}). Let C1 and C2 be two coverings on U . By the above proposition, we know that for any x \u2208 U , PC1(x) = PC2(x) does not imply C1 = C2. Thus if we know nothing about C but DC({1, 2}), we cannot calculate C. However, we can still calculate Cov(C) by Theorem 5. And in this case, with the help of repeat degree, some issues, such as whether Cov(C) is a reduct, whether Cov(C) is a partition, can also be determined."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, we studied further the applications of repeat degree on coverings of neighborhoods.

This paper studies further the application of repeat degree on coverings of neighborhoods. First, we investigate under what condition a covering of neighborhoods is the reduct of the covering inducing it. As a preparation for addressing this issue, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a subset of a set family to be the reduct of the set family. Then we study under what condition two coverings induce a same relation and a same covering of neighborhoods. Finally, we give the method of calculating the covering according to repeat degree.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
