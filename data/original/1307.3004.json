INTRODUCTION", "text": "Wireless Mesh Networks are rapidly deployable, dynamically self organizing, self configuring, self healing, self balancing and self aware multi hop networks. In these networks each node (stationary or mobile) has the capability to join and create a network automatically by sensing nodes with a similar capability within its radio range. WMNs can be categorized to three types: (1) Infrastructure Mesh; (2) Client Mesh and (3) Hybrid Mesh [1].\nThe routing algorithms of a WMN must work in a decentralized, self-organizing and self configuring manner. The routing protocols developed for MANETs can usually be applied to WMNs as well e.g. Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) [2], Topology Broadcast based Reverse Path Forwarding (TBRPF) [3], Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) [4] etc. The existing MAC and routing protocols applied to WMNs do not provide enough scalability [5]. The factors like resource allocation, interference avoidance and rate adaptation across multiple hops critically affects the routing path selection [6]. In a WMN the performance parameters can be categorized\nas per flow; per node; per link; inter flow and network wide parameters. These routing metrics are Airtime Cost Routing Metric [6], Hop Count, Per-Hop Round Trip Time (RTT) [7], Metric of Interference and Channel-Switching (MIC) [8], Expected Transmission Count (ETX) [9], Expected Transmission on a Path (ETOP) [10], Expected Transmission Time (ETT) and Weighted Cumulative ETT (WCETT) [11], Low Overhead Routing Metric [12, 13], Effective Number of Transmissions (ENT) [14], Bottleneck Link Capacity (BLC) [15], Per-Hop Packet Pair Delay and Expected Data Rate (EDR) [16], etc. The comparison of performance metrics on a routing algorithm is discussed in [16]. Soft computing based techniques provide the optimal solution and quickly adapts to dynamic environmental changes [17]. In this paper, we propose two soft computing approaches for addressing the routing problem in WMNs, namely BB-BC and BBO.\nThis paper is organized into five sections. Section I presents the motivation for the present work. Section II introduces the Big Bang Big Crunch (BB-BC) and Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO) algorithms. In section III we present a fuzzy logic based approach to evaluate integrated link cost (ILC) for each link consisting of throughput, end-to-end delay and average jitter of a given path. In section IV, BB-BC and BBO are employed to evaluate the shortest path in the configured network. The section V compares the performance of two algorithms. Conclusions are drawn in Section VI."}, {"heading": "2. BIG BANG BIG CRUNCH (BB-BC) AND BIOGEOGRAPHY BASED OPTIMIZATION (BBO)", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 BB-BC Optimization Algorithm", "text": "The Big Bang theory is one of the most widely accepted theories of the evolution of this universe [18]. The BB-BC theory believes that energy discharged by the initial explosion i.e., kinetic energy, is counterbalanced by the energy of bodies attraction known as gravitational pull. If there is enough mass so that the later is bigger than the first when a critic density is reached, the expansion will stop and the universe will start to contract, leading to an end very similar to its beginning, named by the scientists as the Big Crunch (Great Implosion). In the Big Bang phase, energy dissipation produces disorder and randomness as the main feature of this phase. In the Big Crunch phase, randomly distributed particles are drawn into an order. This theory of repeated big bang followed by big crunch phases forms the basis of an optimization algorithm called the Big Bang-Big Crunch optimization algorithm [19, 20].\nPrimarily a set of candidate solutions (population) is generated randomly in the search space. The fitness as defined by the objective function, of each solution is enumerated and ranked accordingly. After the random Big Bang phase contraction is applied in Big Crunch phase to compute the centre of mass as:\n\u2211 =\n\u2211\n= =\nN\ni if\nN\ni i\nx i\nf x\nC\n1\n1\n1\n1 (1)\nwhere xc = position of the centre of mass; xi = position of ith candidate; f i = fitness function value of candidate i; N = population size.\nBest fit individual can also be considered as the centre of mass instead of using Equation (1) alternatively. Generate new population around the centre of mass by adding or subtracting a normal random number whose value decreases as the iterations elapse. This can be formalized as\nklrxx C new /+= (2) where xc stands for center of mass, l is the upper limit of the parameter, r is a normal random number and k is the iteration step. Then new point xnew is upper and lower bounded. Pseudo Code for optimal path evaluation in WMNs using BB-BC based Algorithm is shown in Figure 1.\nbegin\n/ BB-BC Parameter Initialization for WMN/ Define Number and location of the nodes Source Node, Terminal Node, Number of Paths, Number of Iterations, / End of BB-BC Parameter Initialization/ /Building of paths and Connectivity Matrix/ for i = 1 : n / all n Nodes /\nfor j = 1 : n / all n Nodes /\nif distance (i, j) <= R (radio range of a node)\nconnectivity_matrix(i, j) = 1 /routing table maintenance/ Integrated_Link_Cost (i, j )= f (Throughput, Delay, Jitter) /Integrated Link Cost Evaluation using Fuzzy System/ end if\nend for j\nend for i / Build paths between source and terminal node / while (t < MaxGeneration or Termination Criteria not met) Randomly generate initial population of k paths /Big Bang Phase/ Compute the ILC of all the candidate solutions Sort the population from best to worst based on ILC /No.1 path is the Optimal path/ Compute the center of mass xc /Big Crunch Phase/ Generate new candidate solutions around xc by adding or subtracting a normal-\n-random Number\nend while\nwait for stipulated time/ wait for an event\nPostprocess results and visualization; end\nFigure 1: Pseudo Code of BB-BC based Algorithm for optimal path evaluation in WMNs"}, {"heading": "2.2 BBO ALGORITHM", "text": "BBO is the study of how species are articulated on the landscape in space and time. MacArthur and Wilson (1963) [21] first suggested that the number of species of a given taxon that become established on an island represents a dynamic equilibrium controlled by the rate of immigration of new species and the rate of extinction (emigration) of previously established species. Based upon the dynamical equilibrium theory Dan Simons [22] proposed BBO algorithm. Since its first application, this meta-heuristic approach has been applied successfully to some engineering applications.

System Model", "text": "To analyse and optimize the performance of routing algorithm of WMN environment simulations were performed for a pre defined scenario in QualNet Simulator [25]. In this simulation, a network of 25 nodes is considered that are placed within a 1500m X 1500m area and operating over 300 seconds. A two ray ground propagation model is used with log normal shadow fading. The transmission power of the nodes is set to 15dBm and the transmission range of the nodes is 250 meters. The data transmission rate is 2Mbits/sec. At the physical layer 802.11b and at MAC layer MAC 802.11 is used. The traffic source is implemented using Constant Bit Rate (CBR), sending at the rate of 1 packet/sec."}, {"heading": "4.

To decide which path or route is to be used for any type of traffic or condition depends on the current values of parameters at the nodes or the links.\nIn the proposed work a routing metric of integrated throughput, end to end delay and jitter has been considered at each node for all of its neighbouring nodes. Considering only forward links a cost function has been proposed using fuzzy logic [26]. For our model to work we assume that each node contains a software based fuzzy logic cost evaluation system as given in figure 4."}, {"heading": "5. Results and Discussion", "text": "Two algorithms BB-BC and BBO were implemented in MATLAB v 7.6.0 (R2008a). Numerical results were computed for both algorithms and are given in Table 1. It is observed from figure 5 and Table 1 that for a 25 node network, the minimum path cost is evaluated with zero error. Further only 30 iterations suffice to make a quick decision about the shortest/near shortest available path to ensure the optimal performance of the model. For 64 node WMN, initially the BB-BC performs better (table 1). However as the number of iterations is increased from 30 to 100, the error of the two reduces to zero. Thus both again produced shortest path for the given scenario. But time taken for finding the shortest path for BBO was 4.96 seconds as against 0.29 seconds for BB-BC. For a 100-node network, we found that minimum error achievable by BBO after 100 iterations was 2.38% as compared to 1.36% of BB-BC. The time taken by BBO for 100 iterations was 9.55 seconds against 0.58 seconds in case of BB-BC. As the number of nodes is increased to 2500, BB-BC took 21.26 seconds for 100 iterations to enumerate a shortest path with 1.90% error. BBO in contrast took 1 hour 12 minutes 29 seconds for the same number of iterations and produced 2.982% error."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion and Future Scope of the Work", "text": "As the network complexity grows, time required to evaluate the exact shortest path increases. This paper presented two recent soft computing based approaches to evaluate near shortest path in a WMN. WMNs being highly dynamic need shortest path periodically to modify their routing strategies. Further the shortest path evaluation technique must be able to compute a near shortest path as quickly as possible so as to keep the routing performance optimal. Keeping the routing policies in mind we proposed an integrated path length measure that takes into account throughput, end-to-end delay and jitter of the link. A fuzzy based approach was used for computing the distance between two adjacent nodes in terms of this integrated metric. Using this integrated cost function as the path length metric we evaluated shortest path between source and destination node using BB-BC and BBO approaches.\nA large number of experiments were conducted to find the shortest path in a 25, 64, 100 and 2500 node models. It was observed that BB-BC approach clearly outperformed BBO approach in terms of evaluation time and error between the actual shortest path and the evaluated near shortest path, evaluated by these two approaches. For the small WMNs of 25, 64 and 100 nodes though the performance of the two was comparable with BB-BC always producing better results. For a 2500 node model BB-BC produced its shortest path with 1.90% error in 21.26 seconds after 100 iterations whereas BBO generated its best path with 2.982% error in 1 hr 12 minute and 29 seconds. Thus, clearly establishing the superiority of BB-BC over BBO for finding the optimal path in a WMN."}], "references": [{"title": "Wireless mesh networks: a survey", "author": ["IF Akyildiz", "X Wang", "W Wang"], "venue": "Computer Networks Journal (Elsevier)", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2005}, {"title": "On the scalability of IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks", "author": ["L.
