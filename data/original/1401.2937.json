Introduction", "text": "The share of non-English documents on the internet is rising continuously. While many private users will only be interested in finding monolingual information in their own language, the need for multilingual information retrieval, information extraction and cross-lingual information access for professionals, organisations and businesses is rising steadily. Starting from the premise that we need multilingual text mining tools, the question we would like to ask here is: How can we avoid that the development of (any) text mining application for N languages takes N times the effort of developing them for one language. It is generally acknowledged that developers benefit from the experience of having produced tools in one or more languages before, and that the existence of an efficient implementation infrastructure is extremely important (e.g. Maynard et al. 2002). Such software building blocks can include, for instance, a grammar implementation formalism, tools for marking up text, debugging tools, automatic evaluation tools and procedures, etc. Furthermore, simple applications like sentence splitters are typically so similar for different languages that \u2013 once one exists \u2013 the same tool is usually quickly adapted to new languages. We will thus try to take the effort of developing the infrastructure out of the equation. The question should thus be reformulated: Assuming that you have already developed text mining applications for some languages, how can you limit the effort involved in the development of such applications for several other languages.\nIn the next section, we will try to demonstrate the need for multilingual text processing and to\nshow that most application providers offer monolingual tools or tools covering a few commonly spoken languages. In Section (3), we will describe the type of data we work with (mostly news) and give a short overview of the functionality of the Europe Media Monitor family of applications. In Section (4), we will then try to answer the main question asked here. First, we will summarise insights by other multilingual system developers (0) and discuss the contribution of Machine Learning methods (0) \u2013 in our view an extremely promising approach to go highly multilingual. We\nwill then present our own guidelines on how to minimise the effort of multilingual tool development (0), which \u2013 of course \u2013 largely overlap with those proposed by others. In Section 5, we will give some examples of what these insights and guidelines concretely mean for the development of a small selection of natural language processing tools. One obvious bottleneck for the development of multilingual tools is the lack of linguistic resources. In Section 6, we thus share our view on which kind of resources would be particularly beneficial to achieve highly multilingual text mining applications. Section 7 summarises and concludes."}, {"heading": "2. Motivation for multilingual text mining", "text": "The Joint Research Centre (JRC) is the scientific-technical arm of the European Commission (EC). The European Union (EU) institution EC is a multinational organisation with strong links also to countries outside the EU. It is thus natural that multilinguality plays a big role inside the organisation. However, experience with the many partners and customers of the JRC shows clearly that even many national organisations have a need for highly multilingual text processing applications.\nThe JRC receives frequent requests to monitor media reports in dozens of languages, involving news gathering, classification, information extraction and analysis. The JRC\u2019s users consist of EU institutions, state organisations inside its 27 Member States, institutions of partners outside the EU (e.g. in the USA, Canada, China, etc.), as well as international organisations (including various United Nations and pan-African sub-organisations). These users have a wide range of interests so that not only media reports in the 23 official EU languages need to be monitored, but also, for instance, those in the languages of the EU\u2019s neighbouring countries, of the world\u2019s crisis areas and of political partner countries around the world.\nTo give a concrete example: Public Health organisations around the world monitor any threats to\nthe populations of their counties \u2013 be they chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN). For that purpose, they not only gather information on communicable diseases, etc. from their hospitals (indicator-based risk monitoring), but they also scan online news articles and government websites to find out about the outbreak of communicable diseases, etc. (event-based risk monitoring; Linge et al. 2009). In the era of high mobility and mass long-distance travel, the risk of contracting a disease (e.g. the human influenza virus, also referred to as \u2018swine flu\u2019 and H1N1), taking it home and\npassing it o tourist desti thoroughly,\nIt is our\ninformation events and Iraq or Isra world langu local report about pasto monitoring information\nInformat points of vi world even various cou\nn to others nations and\nby monito experience\ncompleme\nevents that el, or report\nages.

When only reading English language news, readers will thus get an inflated impression of the importance of the US President and the British Prime Minister, while the readers of Russian, Arabic or Spanish language news will get quite a different impression.\nThe most common approach to capturing information published in foreign languages is the use of\nMachine Translation into one target language (e.g. English) and to apply information filtering and extraction tools in that target language. A limitation of this approach is that proper names and specialist terms are frequently badly translated so that information can easily get lost. Our own insight (supported by the native language hypothesis observed by Larkey et al. 2004) is that information filtering in the source language is more efficient than filtering machine-translated text. In the USA, Machine Translation is nevertheless an attractive solution, as there is only one official national language. However, when looking at Europe, Asia and other parts of the world, it becomes clear that the situation in the US is an exception rather than the rule, as there is no agreement on one common language.\nNews aggregators such as Google News1, Yahoo News2 and EMM3 already gather and cluster\nnews in many languages (currently 46, 32 and 50 languages, respectively \u2013 status February 2011), but most of the more complex systems carrying out some level of analysis of the gathered texts are monolingual, including SiloBreaker4, NewsVine5 and DayLife6. The news analysis systems NewsTin7 and the EMM product NewsExplorer8 are notable exceptions, covering 11 and 20 languages, respectively.\nWe believe that the main reason for the existence of monolingual analysis systems is the large\neffort required to produce text processing software for new languages. In the worst case, the effort required to develop tools in N languages is N times the effort of developing monolingual software, but various multilingual system developers have found methods to minimise this effort. These insights will be the main focus of the rest of the paper.\n1 See http://news.google.com .

The Europe Media Monitor family of applications", "text": "The Europe Media Monitor (EMM, Steinberger et al. 2009) is the basic engine that gathers an average of about 100,000 news articles per day in approximately 50 languages9, from about 2,500 hand-selected web news sources, from a couple of hundred specialist and government websites, as well as from about twenty commercial news providers. EMM visits the news web sites up to every five minutes to search for the latest articles. When news sites offer RSS feeds, EMM makes use of these, otherwise it extracts the news text from the often complex HTML pages. All news items are converted to Unicode. They are processed in a pipeline structure, where each module adds additional information. Whenever files are written, the system uses UTF-8-encoded RSS format.\n9 As of February 2011, the website actually lists 54 languages, but some of them are extremely low-volume and EMM may not capture news in these languages every day.\nThe EMM news gathering engine feeds its articles into the four fully-automatic public news analysis systems (accessible via http://emm.jrc.it/overview.html), and to their non-public sister applications (Steinberger et al. 2009). The major concern of NewsBrief and MedISys is breaking news and short-term trend detection (topic tracking), early alerting and up-to-date category-specific news display. NewsExplorer focuses on daily overviews, long-term trends (topic tracking), linking of related news across languages, in-depth analysis and extraction of information about people and organisations (see Figure 2). EMM-Labs is a collection of more recent developments, including a multilingual event scenario template filling application, a multilingual multi-document summarisation demonstrator, and various tools to visualise extracted news data. For NewsBrief and MedISys, there are different access levels, distinguishing the entirely public web sites from an ECinternal website. The public websites do not contain commercial sources and offer slightly reduced functionality.\nThe following JRC-developed text mining methods and tools are used and closely integrated in\nEMM; if not mentioned otherwise, they work for 20 languages: document clustering and Boolean classification (50 languages); breaking news detection and automatic user notification (50 languages); Named Entity Recognition (persons, organisations); name variant matching (i.e. string distance calculation, including across scripts); geo-tagging (recognition, disambiguation and grounding for map-display); quotation recognition (reported speech by and about named entities); multi-label classification using the thousands of categories from the Eurovoc10 thesaurus; multimonolingual topic tracking (to detect \u2018stories\u2019) and aggregation of information per \u2018story\u2019; crosslingual news cluster linking (available for the majority of the 190 possible language pairs); social network generation based on information extracted from multilingual news (based on co-occurrence, and also on who mentions whom in reported speech); detailed scenario template filling for events causing victims (violence, natural disasters, accidents, disease outbreaks, etc.; seven languages); visualisation (using geographical maps, trends, social networks, etc.).\nEMM was mostly developed to serve the interests of the European Institutions and their\ninternational partners, but the public web pages are also visited by an average of 30,000 anonymous users per day.\n10 See http://europa.eu/eurovoc/. Automatic Eurovoc indexing has been trained for 22 EU languages."}, {"heading": "4. How to achieve multilinguality", "text": "Many individual natural language processing applications have been developed for several languages, covering varying numbers of languages. We have not found many publications directly addressing the issue on how to minimise the effort of multilingual tool development, but several that describe the efforts of adapting a certain tool to a new language. Typically, these applications are named entity recognition systems or syntactic parsers. Section 0 contains a list of ideas found in such publications. Section 0 addresses the role of Machine Learning approaches, which seem to be particularly useful to achieve multilinguality. Section 4.3 briefly highlights the use of methods for cross-lingual projection. Section 0 summarises our own approach which, obviously, in many cases, overlaps with that of other developers.\nRelated work: Insights by other multilingual developers\nMultiple authors have described work on developing resources and tools for a number of different languages. This was typically done by reusing the resources from a first language and adapting them to new languages (e.g. Gamon et al 1997; Rayner & Bouillon 1996; Pastra et al. 2002; Carenini et al. 2007; Maynard et al. 2003). Practical tips from various system developers for achieving multilinguality include the use of Unicode and of the usage of virtual keyboards to enter foreign language script (Maynard et al. 2002); modularity (Pastra et al. 2002; Maynard et al. 2002); simplicity of rules and the lexicon (Carenini et al. 2007; Vergne 2002); uniform input and output structures (Carenini et al. 2007; Bering et al. 2003); and the use of shared token classes that are ideally based on surface-oriented features such as case, hyphenation, and includes-number (Bering et al. 2003). SProUT grammar developers took the interesting approach of using shared resources between languages (lexica, gazetteers, grammar rules) for named entity recognition in seven languages, and of splitting the multilingual grammar rule files (Bering et al. 2003): some files contain rules that are applicable to several languages (e.g. to recognise dates of the format 20.10.2010) while others contain language-specific rules (e.g. to cover 20th of October 2010). The fact that this latter date format, and others, can also be captured by using language-independent patterns was shown by Ignat et al. (2003).\nBoth Maynard et al. (2002) and Pastra et al. (2002) point out that the usage of theory-neutral\ndata types is an advantage for the Language Engineering architecture GATE because it facilitates\nreuse. This does make sense for a platform that is meant to be used by many groups for many purposes. However, there are several grammar developers who point out that adhering to grammar theories is very efficient because they separate universal rules from language-specific parameters and differences. For instance, Bender & Flickinger (2005) highlight the benefits of adhering to HeadDriven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) for writing multilingual general-purpose grammars. They even propose to generate starter grammars for new languages automatically, based on a number of linguistic features of that language. Gamon et al. (1997) report that the framework of Universal Grammar allows them to create a generic grammar that \u201ccan easily be parameterised to handle many languages\u201d. Interestingly, they provide detailed information on the percentage of grammar rule overlap between their original English general-purpose Microsoft-NLP grammar and the German, French and Spanish grammars they derived from the English version. Wehrli (2007), using Chomsky\u2019s generative grammar to build parsers for six languages, stipulates that the design he adopts \u201cmakes it possible to \u2018plug\u2019 an additional language without any change or any recompilation of the system. It is sufficient to add the language-specific modules and lexical databases\u201d. Ranta (2009, e.g. pp. 47ff), having worked within the Grammatical Framework on fourteen languages, also addresses the degree of grammar sharing across languages, as well as within language families. He highlights that the mere existence of an abstract syntax implies grammar sharing and he shows that some linguistic phenomena can be treated in a systematic way.\nVergne (2002) does not adhere to a grammar theory, but tries to reach language-independence by\nusing an extremely simple, minimalistic and radical approach to building multilingual chunkers and (partial) parsers, without using full dictionaries. He shows the feasibility of his approach by building a tool that extracts subject-verb combinations for five languages, using dictionaries of only about 200 elements per language, case information and regular expressions matching certain combinations of word endings. More recently, Vergne (2009) proposed a chunker using only string length and word frequency, and applied it to 23 languages. The basic idea, which we share, is thus to limit the used resources to a bare minimum, i.e. to those elements that are required for a specific task.\nIt goes without saying that simple applications can more easily be achieved with simple means\nand that more complex applications are likely to benefit from a deeper linguistic analysis. There is thus not one solution for all tools and applications. However, we observed \u2013 for the information\nextraction tasks we are targeting \u2013 that even simple means can take you relatively far, and that minimalism and simplicity paid off for us."}, {"heading": "Related work: Machine Learning", "text": "Machine Learning (ML) approaches have become very popular. Helped by the availability of more data and increased computer processing power, the technology has advanced a lot over the last years and the trend is likely to continue. The obvious appeal of self-learning software is that it will by itself take care of learning rules and vocabulary, and that it can be optimised for real-life data by training it on such data. ML is thus a very promising solution to achieve high multilinguality.\nIn the field of Machine Translation (MT), statistical (i.e. self-learning) methods are currently the\nmajor paradigm, i.e. systems that learn automatically from texts that have previously been translated manually. Google translate11 now offers all language pair combinations for the impressive number of 58 languages, i.e. 1653 language pairs (status: February 2011). Never before has any translation software been available for so many languages. A current trend is to combine purely statistical MT with symbolic MT, e.g. by integrating the processing of syntactic rules (e.g. Goutte et al. 2009). When doing this, the question arises again how this can be done with minimal effort for many languages, but presumably the rules will be rather language or language pair-dependent.\nIn the field of Named Entity Recognition (NER), ML techniques have been widely used (Nadeau\n& Sekine 2009). The most common approach is to use supervised ML, i.e. training a system on previously annotated corpora. While the idea is attractive, the de-facto limitation is the fact that producing such annotated corpora (e.g. for new languages) is labour-intensive and expensive. Alternatives are to use semi-supervised or unsupervised learning methods. Semi-supervised learning involves a set of seeds to start the learning process and boot-strapping methods to gradually increase the number of patterns and resources. Unsupervised learning makes use of external resources and observations, and especially of large corpora. An example for such work applied to NER is that of Shinyama & Sekine (2004), who tried to detect named entities based on the observation that a named entity is likely to appear synchronously in several news articles, whereas common nouns have different distribution patterns. An open issue is how to combine ML methods with manual intervention, e.g. if one wants to manually correct and improve the machine-learnt recognition rules.\n11 http://translate.google.com/\nML methods, especially semi-supervised and unsupervised, are clearly very promising when\nattempting to achieve high multilinguality. In the context of EMM, however, we decided for ourselves to use hand-crafted rules, and to enhance manually produced dictionaries and word lists by using bootstrapping and Machine Learning methods. Doing this allows us to keep control over the recognition performance. Most recent publications on IE describe ML methods, often highlighting the language-independence of the described approach. However, through personal communication with many system developers, we got the impression that most existing multilingual IE applications are in fact rule-based, or \u2013 like in EMM \u2013 that the use of ML is restricted to lexical acquisition.\nWe believe that our approach requires less time per language than when using pure Machine\nLearning methods. We typically invest a maximum of three person months to add a new language to the tool set, as this is the average time of having a native speaker trainee available to us. In this time period, the person can discover and add news sources, translate the Boolean category definitions used in EMM-NewsBrief and in MedISys, provide the linguistic IE resources for the new language, and test the performance. However, it is also possible to produce reasonable initial linguistic resources to recognise named entities and quotations in a new language within one working week. Information redundancy is high in EMM, so that we aim at high precision and accept lower recall, assuming that, if we miss some information in one article, we are likely to find it in another.\nRelated work: Cross-lingual projection\nThe shortage of annotated multilingual data that can be used to train or evaluate IE tools in\nvarious languages is sometimes addressed through cross-lingual projection, using parallel corpora. The idea is to benefit from the availability of data in a resource-rich language such as English and to project the English annotations into the other language(s). For instance, Bentivogli et al. (2004) project semantic word sense annotations from English to Italian, using a bilingual parallel text collection and word-alignment tools. Ehrmann & Turchi (2010) aim to overcome the shortage in annotated NE data by projecting NE annotations from English documents to French, German, Spanish and Czech documents, using a multi-parallel corpus and word-aligning the languages with a phrase-based statistical Machine Translation system. Turchi et al. (2010), finally, create a sevenlanguage gold standard document collection to evaluate multilingual multi-document extractive summarisation software, by manually selecting the most important English sentences from each\ncluster and by projecting the selection into the sentence-aligned target language documents. When using this gold standard collection to evaluate their multilingual summariser, they made an interesting observation: Their purely statistical \u2013 and thus in principle language-independent \u2013 tool performed rather differently across languages, which is unexpected as the general assumption would be that the performance should be comparable. This insight would not have been possible without using a parallel document collection allowing the accurate comparison of text mining results across languages.\nHaving access to multilingual gold standard data is obviously very important in the highly\nmultilingual EMM setting. Annotation projection is an obvious and promising way of generating such evaluation data. The biggest bottleneck is the lack of parallel corpora covering more than only two or three languages."}, {"heading": "Insights by EMM developers", "text": "Due to the strict requirement of having to analyse documents in many languages (ideally, all 23\nofficial EU languages, plus more) while working in a small team (three computational linguists during most of the years, but currently seven), we always had to use minimalistic methods and try to achieve with them as much as possible. Basically, we were reduced to not using parsers, part-ofspeech taggers, morphological analysers and full dictionaries for any of the languages, and we had to keep the effort of adding a new language to the tool set to about three months, including testing. While good linguistic resources are available freely for some languages, we could not make use of them as we needed to keep the work parallel for all languages. The kind of resources we do use are targeted word lists (name titles; gazetteers of place names; sentiment words; reporting verbs and \u2013 very important \u2013 different types of stop words, etc.); mixed-language Boolean combinations of category-defining words; the output of our own NER tools; statistics, heuristics, boot-strapping methods and machine learning.\nRegarding methods to keep the development effort per language down, we basically had the same\ninsights other groups identified (i.e. those mentioned in the first paragraph in section 0). The most important ones for us are modularity and simplicity. Another principle we often applied, closely linked to simplicity, is under-specification. The idea is: don\u2019t formulate constraints if you don\u2019t urgently need them, as they are time-consuming to produce and they may hinder you in your analysis\nof other languages. For instance, if it is not strictly necessary in local patterns to specify the morphological agreement and the order of words or word groups (e.g. modifiers for titles in person name recognition), simply leave them unspecified (see also Section Error! Reference source not found.).\nAnother difference to the work presented in 0 is that we developed further the idea of using\nmostly language-independent rules that make reference to language-specific resource files containing application-focused word lists. For applications such as person and organisation name recognition, quotation recognition, and for geo-tagging and grounding (distinguishing, e.g., which of the 15 locations world-wide with the name of Paris is being referred to in the text), this principle was adhered to quite closely. In exceptional cases, such as person name recognition in Arabic (which does not distinguish upper and lower case), separate recognition patterns were added and located in the file containing the language-specific information (Zaghouani et al. 2010). That way, the resulting system is entirely modular. When adding a new language, it is normally sufficient to plug in the language-specific parameter file. For person name recognition, this file includes long lists of words, phrases and regular expressions that are typically found next to person names and that help determine whether some uppercase words are a name or not. The resulting patterns can also identify and store names and titles in more complex expressions such as: the recently elected chairperson of LREC, Nicoletta Calzolari, or Tony Blair, 57-year old former British Prime Minister. The required word lists are usually produced using seed patterns, machine learning and knowledge discovery, and boot-strapping, but external knowledge sources such as Wikipedia are of course also used, when available.\nHighly inflected languages are a challenge for simple methods that rely a lot on matching\nexpressions in a text against word lists. To solve the problem, we either apply some simple languagedependent suffix stripping and suffix replacement rules (e.g. to recognise New Yorgile as an Estonian inflection of the name New York), or we pre-generate many variants of known names so as to facilitate their recognition in text, using finite state tools. Our data base contains over 1 million known entities (plus additional hundreds of thousands of known name variants), collected through multi-annual multilingual information extraction. For example, for the name part (Tony) Blair and the Slovenian language, inflections such as the following are automatically generated: Blairom, Blairju, Blairjem, etc.\nFor the more complex task of event scenario template filling in seven languages (Arabic, English,\nFrench, Italian, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish), we did not entirely adhere to the principle of language-independent grammars (Tanev et al. 2009). However, the approach still is minimalistic in the sense that no part-of-speech taggers or syntactic parsers are used and that we do not use complete dictionaries. Instead, the system uses local grammars to identify the information for the individual slots, such as: event type; number, status and type of victims; perpetrator; weapon; location and time. This information is then combined to produce the entire event description.12\nThe approach for the development of multilingual text mining applications in EMM is described\nin more detail in Steinberger et al. (2008), where we also give an overview of how these generic principles work in practice, for seven different text mining applications. In Steinberger et al. (forthcoming), we describe the concrete effort of adding a new language to the tool set: the African Bantu language Swahili.\nEMM-NewsExplorer also offers some cross-lingual functionality for its twenty languages, i.e.\ncross-lingual cluster linking, name variant matching (including across scripts), and merging the information extracted about entities in all monitored languages. As there are 190 language pairs for 20 languages, the use of bilingual resources and methods needed to be strictly avoided. Another guideline we follow is thus: for cross-lingual applications, avoid the usage of bilingual resources and favour (more or less) language pair-independent methods (see also Section 5.1).\nIt should be clear by now that EMM tools do not adhere to a grammar theory or any other\ntheoretical framework."}, {"heading": "5.

If the quotation makes reference to another known entity, this will be recorded, as well (quotation about an entity). Details on this tool can be found in Pouliquen et al. (2007b). The patterns make reference to quotation markers (e.g. \u201c, \u2018, \u00ab), person or organisation names identified in the same article, reporting verbs (e.g. said, reported\u00b8 argues, etc.) and a range of modifiers that can be found between any of the other elements (e.g. yesterday, on TV, etc.). The simplified sample rule below would successfully identify the quotation, the speaker (Angela Merkel) and the entity referred to in the quotation (Barack Obama) in the following string: Merkel said yesterday on TV \u201c\u2026Obama \u2026\u201d.\nNAME REPORTING_VERB MODIFIER \u201cQUOTE\u201d\nNote that the co-reference between the US President or President Obama and the known entity\nBarack Obama will be established if the full name is mentioned at least once in the document and if either at least one name part and/or one of the many previously identified titles for that name are found.\nTo comply with the simplicity and under-specification requirement, the order of modifiers and\nany morphological agreement (e.g. in number or gender) will not be specified.

Questions asked concern the (positive or negative) attitude of 14 See, for example, Barack Obama\u2019s page at http://emm.newsexplorer.eu/NewsExplorer/entities/en/1510.html .\nmedia sources in certain countries towards these targets, and of changes across languages and over time. Approaches to opinion mining vary widely regarding the methods and the depth of analysis (see, e.g. Pang & Lee 2008). Due to our multilinguality requirement, we again need to use the simplest possible methods, involving the usage of word lists (positive and negative words, polarity inverters, strength enhancers and diminishers) and previously recognised named entities). To avoid negative news content (e.g. in news on natural disasters) having an impact on the detected sentiment towards any entity mentioned in these news items, we decided not to consider sentiment words that are also part of EMM\u2019s category-defining terms, such as disaster, tsunami and flood for the EMM category \u2018Natural Disasters\u2019. These category-defining terms are not ideal for the task of distinguishing good or bad news content from positive or negative sentiment, but they are readily available for all EMM languages. To ensure furthermore that the sentiment words actually apply to the entity we are interested in, we use word windows around the entities and their titles. Experiments with various English language sentiment vocabularies showed that the best-performing results were achieved with a window size of six words to either side of the entity and its titles. See Balahur et al. (2010) for details.\nMany English language sentiment dictionaries are freely available, but such vocabulary lists are\nscarce for other languages. Having identified a reasonably performing language-independent method for sentiment analysis, we are currently working on semi-automatically generating large non-English sentiment vocabularies."}, {"heading": "Multilingual multi-document summarisation", "text": "Due to the high redundancy of EMM\u2019s news content (100,000 news articles per day collected\nfrom about 2,500 different media sources), a major task performed by the EMM systems is to group related articles into clusters, and to track the development of these news clusters over time (topic detection and tracking). Currently, EMM displays the title and description of each cluster\u2019s centroid article, but a proper summary per cluster, and update summaries for clusters related over time, would be very useful. This was the motivation to work on multilingual multi-document summarisation.\nAs abstractive summarisation would require many linguistic resources, our multilingual\nenvironment restricts us to extractive methods, not considering syntax. The proposed solution consists of using latent semantic analysis (LSA) to select the most informative sentences from the\nwhole cluster (similar to Gong & Liu 2002). To reduce redundancy in the summaries, the information covered in already selected sentences is subtracted from the LSA vector representation in order to ensure that the next sentences contain new information. The approach is thus based on a language-independent vector representation. However, in addition to a list of words and wordngrams per sentence, the LSA input in our system consists of previously identified entity mentions, and of (non-disambiguated) mentions of terms from the multilingual MeSH thesaurus (Medical Subject Headings15). The idea behind this approach is (a) to give higher weight to entities and (b) to capture some synonymy and hyponymy relations, both to select the most important sentences and to avoid information redundancy in the selected sentences. Due to our historical collection of multilingual name variants and a list of previously found titles for each entity, our lookup recognises name mentions even if the spelling varies. The approach was successful at the TAC\u20192009 competition, achieving second place in the most important category overall responsiveness, out of 54 submissions. For an overview of that system, see Kabadjov et al. (2010)."}, {"heading": "6. Required language resources", "text": "In the previous sections, we tried to summarise the constraints we imposed on ourselves when\ndeveloping multilingual text mining applications. We also tried to sketch simple solutions that allowed us to avoid using too many linguistic resources. If linguistic resources had been freely available for all the languages we are trying to cover, development time would have been reduced and it is likely that the results achieved would be better. In this section we thus want to give an idea of tools and resources that \u2013 we believe \u2013 would enable the community to build multilingual text mining applications better and more quickly.\nThe major \u2013 probably banal \u2013 statement we would like to make is that the community would\nstrongly benefit from freely available, simple, parallel and uniform multilingual dictionaries, corpora and software tools.\nThe resources should ideally be free because universities and research organisations in many\ncountries would otherwise not get access to these resources. This is particularly true for lesser-used languages, which are the majority of languages. The current situation leads to a scientific brain drain\n15 See http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/. The multilingual MeSH term recognition software was developed by Health-onthe-Net (HON, http://www.hon.ch/).\nbecause students and researchers around the world have to work on (mostly) English language applications because this is one of the very few languages for which tools are readily available. If working on their own languages, they would be reduced to developing basic tools and resources such as corpora, dictionaries and morphological analysers.\nThe tools and resources should be simple because they would otherwise never be built for many\nlanguages. We believe this to be true because of the associated cost, the time required for the development, and the limitations on available qualified manpower. At a recent FLaReNet event16, Grefenstette (2010) presented the idea of a community-based Web 2.0 effort to build simple dictionaries for many languages. The basic idea is to ask native speakers to provide lemma, main part(s)-of-speech and English translation(s) for a list of (possibly frequency-sorted) word surface forms. The usual Web 2.0 incentives and control mechanisms could be applied and the resource could be downloadable anytime by anyone. Even non-linguists can provide this type of information. Usability would be limited for more complex applications requiring, for instance, sub-categorisation frames, but applications like those developed as part of EMM would certainly benefit. Grefenstette\u2019s pragmatic proposal of also providing the English translation is probably the most arguable feature. Amendments to his ideas may also be useful for compounding and agglutinative languages.\nThe tools and resources should be parallel and uniform, i.e. input and output format should be the\nsame for all languages, the same set of parts-of-speech and syntactic categories should be used for all, etc. Ideally, resources should also be linked across languages. Uniform and parallel dictionaries would allow, for instance, writing multilingual rules and patterns much more easily. Successful efforts that produced such lexical resources in the past were Multext17, Multext-East18, GeoNames19 and the various multilingual WordNet-related projects20. The Eurovoc thesaurus21, a multilingual categorisation scheme with over 6,000 classes used by parliaments in Europe, was not developed for machine use, but it is still very useful because it covers almost thirty languages and it has been used to manually classify large numbers of documents. Using such uniform lexical resources, multilingual grammars are likely to be much more comparable and the effort of adapting a grammar to another language would be minimised. 16 See http://www.flarenet.eu/?q=node/347. 17 http://www.issco.unige.ch/en/research/projects/MULTEXT.html 18 See http://nl.ijs.si/ME/ 19 See http://www.geonames.org/ 20 See http://www.globalwordnet.org/ 21 See http://europa.eu/eurovoc/ .\nParallel corpora are also much more useful than multi-monolingual corpora. Apart from their\nusefulness to train statistical machine translation and to construct multilingual dictionaries, they can be exploited to train and evaluate systems for information extraction, alignment, document categorisation, and more, with minimal effort. In spite of its limited subject domain, the 22-language parallel corpus JRC-Acquis (Steinberger et al. 2006) has therefore been useful for various multilingual tasks. As shown by Ehrmann & Turchi (2010) for Named Entity Recognition and by Turchi et al. (2010) for multi-document summarisation, annotations in one language version of a parallel corpus can be projected to the other languages, thus considerably saving annotation effort and creating a multilingual parallel training and evaluation resource. When evaluating any text mining tool on such a parallel resource, the performance across languages can be compared directly and fairly because the otherwise unknown parameters corpus size, text type, varying frequency of linguistic phenomena, etc. are the same for all languages. The tests carried out by Turchi et al. (2010), for instance, showed that the purely statistical software for multilingual multi-document summarisation produced rather different results for different languages on such a parallel corpus, raising questions regarding the common universality assumptions of language-independent software.\nIn the CoNLL shared tasks 2006 and 2007 (Nivre et al. 2007), dependency parsers were trained\nand tested for 13 and 10 languages, respectively. This was a very useful effort for creating resources, promoting multilinguality, and more. However, as the training corpora used different grammatical features and labels (e.g. for part-of-speech and syntactic phrases), the output for the same parsing system is not homogeneous across languages. Any rules reading the dependency tree output would thus need to be written differently for each language. This limits the usability of the otherwise very useful multilingual tool enormously. Software tools trained or built with uniform and parallel resources are likely to be parallel, or at least very similar, themselves. They would minimise any effort of building upon their output considerably.\nIt is also important to have a single access point for licensing issues (such as ELDA22 and LDC23)\nto avoid having to contact many different content providers when building a highly multilingual system, although the usage entirely without licences would, of course, allow even more flexibility. Last, but not least, continuity of secure funding is obviously an important development factor for highly multilingual applications: Universities and other organisations receiving project-specific 22 See http://www.elda.org/ 23 See http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/\nfunding do not usually have the opportunity to extend their work to larger numbers of languages as they keep having to work on new areas.\nIt goes without saying that building resources and tools with these specifications is expensive and\ntime-consuming. The number of highly multilingual parallel texts is limited and copyright issues may make it difficult to use them. The existence of the resources and tools described here may remain a dream. However, we feel that such resources would be a big step towards developing highly multilingual text mining applications, and awareness may be the first step towards achieving this goal.\nThere has been a lot of progress recently in the field of multilinguality and multilingual resources,\nwhich gives us hope that \u2013 also from a linguistic point of view \u2013 this world will soon be much smaller. Past and present initiatives such as FLaReNet24, CLARIN25, CLEF26, ENABLER27, METANet\u2019s resource initiative META-SHARE28, LDC\u2019s Less Commonly Taught Languages project29 and the Global WordNet Association30 are very promising and encouraging."}, {"heading": "7. Summary and Conclusion", "text": "We have tried to show that there is a strong need for highly multilingual text mining applications\n(10, 20 or more languages), but that most available and operational systems cover only one or a small number of languages. Assuming that this is mostly due to the fact that the development of natural language processing tools for each language is time-consuming and expensive, we asked the question how the development effort per language can be minimised. The major tips and ideas we found in publications and personal discussions with multilingual system developers are: (a) keep your system modular; (b) keep the system simple, not only from a user\u2019s point of view, but also from that of the developer; (c) try to use uniform input and output structures; (d) use shared token classes, ideally based on surface-oriented features; (e) try to share grammar rules and lexical resources between languages; and (f) try to be minimalistic by providing and using only the type of information really needed for the application, rather than filling the whole paradigm (e.g. use partial\n24 See http://www.flarenet.eu/ 25 See http://www.clarin.eu/ 26 See http://www.clef-campaign.org/ 27 See http://www.enabler-network.org/ 28 See http://www.meta-net.eu/meta-share 29 See http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/LCTL/ 30 See http://www.globalwordnet.org/\ndictionaries rather than trying to produce a complete lexicon for a language). Several developers of multilingual parsers furthermore pointed out the advantage of (g) adhering to grammar theories, as these allow stipulating general principles that apply to whole groups of languages, i.e. another type of grammar sharing. From an architectural point of view, however, the point was made that a theoryneutral approach is more flexible and lends itself more to a reuse of resources. While developing various text mining tools in up to twenty languages for the Europe Media Monitor (EMM) family of applications, we furthermore got convinced that it is useful and efficient (h) to write languageindependent rules that make use of information stored in language-specific parameter files; (i) to under-specify wherever possible, in order to save time and not to use restrictions that may get in the way when dealing with another language.\nIn the case of EMM tools, these requirements basically mean that the use of language-specific\nlinguistic resources and tools should be minimised. We thus limited ourselves to work with restricted word lists, lookup procedures, machine learning and bootstrapping methods. Such simple means are rather restrictive and challenging. To show what can and what cannot be done adhering to these restrictions, we sketched the solutions adopted in a few of our own multilingual text mining applications.\nWe saw that machine learning solutions are particularly promising to achieve high\nmultilinguality, but that the need for pre-tagged training data limits at least supervised learning methods to those few languages for which tagged corpora are available. Semi-supervised or unsupervised methods are, in principle, better suited for lesser-used languages, for which few linguistic resources exist. As the output of automatically learnt classifiers and rules cannot normally be easily improved and amended, we suggested the hybrid solution of using hand-crafted rules and to use Machine Learning to acquire the lexical entries.\nWe finally presented our own \u2013 probably unrealistic \u2013 opinion regarding the types of linguistic resources that would be useful to allow the computational linguistics community to develop more highly multilingual text mining applications more quickly, and why. These resources can be described as freely available, simple, parallel and uniform multilingual dictionaries, corpora and software tools. The number of current efforts and projects to produce multilingual resources shows a positive and encouraging trend.\nThere is more than one possible solution to overcome the multilinguality barrier, and each\napplication has its own specific requirements. We hope, though, that this collection and discussion of ideas and insights may be useful for multilingual system developers."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "I would like to thank the following persons for having shared their own multilingual grammar writing experience with us,\nor their views on linguistic resources: Kalina Bontcheva (Sheffield University) on GATE; Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Segond, Caroline\nHag\u00e8ge and Claude Roux (Xerox Research Centre Europe) on the Xerox Incremental Parser; Aarne Ranta (Gothenburg\nUniversity) on the Grammatical Framework; Jacques Vergne (Caen University) on sentence chunking using extremely\nlight-weight methods; Eric Wehrli (Geneva University) on his deep-linguistic parser; Gregory Grefenstette (Exalead) and\nGregor Thurmair (Linguatec) on their respective multilingual products; Khalid Choukri (ELRA/ELDA) and Gregory\nGrefenstette on linguistic resources; and my JRC colleagues Maud Ehrmann, Vanni Zavarella and Hristo Tanev for\nsharing their experiences and for their feedback on earlier versions of the paper.

While Information Extraction and other text mining software can, in principle, be developed for many languages, most text analysis tools have only been applied to small sets of languages because the development effort per language is large. Self-training tools obviously alleviate the problem, but even the effort of providing training data and of manually tuning the results is usually considerable. In this paper, we gather insights by various multilingual system developers on how to minimise the effort of developing natural language processing applications for many languages. We also explain the main guidelines underlying our own effort to develop complex text mining software for tens of languages. While these guidelines \u2013 most of all: extreme simplicity \u2013 can be very restrictive and limiting, we believe to have shown the feasibility of the approach through the development of the Europe Media Monitor (EMM) family of applications (http://press.jrc.it/overview.html). EMM is a set of complex media monitoring tools that process and analyse up to 100,000 online news articles per day in between twenty and fifty languages. We will also touch upon the kind of language resources that would make it easier for all to develop highly multilingual text mining applications. We will argue that \u2013 to achieve this \u2013 the most needed resources would be freely available, simple, parallel and uniform multilingual dictionaries, corpora and software tools.", "creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"}}}
