As linguists, we propose methods and results based on a corpus linguistics approach, assisted by tools such as parsers, statistical tools, terminology extractors, concordancers or scripting languages. More recently, we were approached on the specific problem of writing requirements.\nThe CNES is the French space agency and, as such, is responsible for designing space systems. Therefore, it has to draft specifications (that must clearly and precisely describe its needs) which are intended for companies that respond to the bids; and, in\nnot always clear, and that as a result there may be divergent interpretations, leading to additional costs, delays or even litigation (since requirements are part of the contract clauses).\nIn order to improve the quality of requirements, many projects have been developed by computational researchers to check the consistency of the requirements after they were written (see [2\u20134], among others). Still, we believe that the writing itself can be improved by proposing a guide closer to the actual way in which engineers write requirements.\nIn the present study, two kinds of documents were used: the Guide for Writing Requirements recommendations proposed by INCOSE (International Council on Systems Engineering) [5] (a controlled natural language, see below); and a subset of the specifications of a project: Pleiades (see below).\nWe propose a linguistic diagnosis of the way requirements are written in the project by comparing these requirements with the recommendations of the INCOSE guide.\nThe point of view underlying our approach is that guides for writing specifications are not fully adapted to the real writing process: they are sometimes too constraining, and sometimes insufficiently so. They are not written by linguists but by domain experts with a prescriptive point of view based on their experience. This is the case for example in the field of air-traffic control where the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) phraseology is written by controllers [6]. Even if these guides are not always adapted to the reality of language use, we consider that they constitute a good starting point because of the experience of the domain experts. Our other starting point is constituted by specifications that are not written following the recommendations of a guide: this is the case at CNES.\nIndeed, CNES engineers do not use a controlled natural language in order to write better specifications, only requirement management tools (such as IBM Rational DOORS). Nevertheless, they are all experienced in this type of writing. Thus, even if the writers do not consciously follow a controlled natural language, we assume the existence of regularities in the way they write requirements. Writers are indeed influenced both by existing specifications and by certain spontaneous regularities which tend to occur in each recurrent writing situation, two characteristics attributed to textual genres. According to Bhatia [7], a textual genre may be defined as \u201ca recognizable communicative event characterized by a set of communicative purpose(s) identified and mutually understood by the members of the professional or academic community in which it regularly occurs\u201d.\nIt can be noted that the notion of textual genre is not always properly distinguished from that of sublanguage. See for instance the definition given by Somers: \u201cA sublanguage is an identifiable genre or text-type in a given subject field, with a relatively or even absolutely closed set of syntactic structures and vocabulary\u201d [8]. Other authors such as Kurzon [9], Temnikova [10] or Kuhn [11] have highlighted this point. Historically, the most important difference is that the notion of sublanguage was proposed by Harris from a mathematical and distributional perspective [12], while that of\nlinguistic regularities are associated with speakers of the same community. This feature of spontaneous linguistic regularities has been characterized as normaison (\u201cnorming\u2019) by the French Linguistic School of Rouen [15] as opposed to normalisation (\u201cnormalization\u201d) that concerns the case where linguistic norms are imposed by an organism. In short, we could say that our aim is to propose a normalisation based on the identification of normaison, or, in other words, to improve the writing of specifications without imposing a standard that is too far removed from the engineers\u2019 natural practice.\nThe paper comprises two main parts. In the first one (see section 2), we present the tool-assisted method used for making the diagnosis. In the second one (see section 3), we describe and discuss our preliminary results."}, {"heading": "2 Methodology", "text": "Several guides for writing requirements exist, and most of them were designed to avoid undesirable properties of natural language (\u201cunrestricted natural language brings with it a host of well-known problems\u201d [16]), such as ambiguity, polysemy, vagueness, and so on [1, 17].\nTo ensure that these guidelines are close enough to actual practices, and thus really usable, we decided to carry out a diagnosis of the way the specifications are drafted at CNES and then to compare this process with the recommendations made by one of those guides. The aim is to evaluate the conformity of the requirements to the recommendations, and see if the latter can be brought closer to reality.\nWe will first briefly describe our corpus of requirements and the tools we used, and then the linguistic phenomena selected for study in the controlled natural language that we used as a reference."}, {"heading": "2.1 Description of the corpus", "text": "A subset of the specifications of an Earth observation satellite called Pleiades, launched in 2011, was obtained from the CNES. From these specifications, we extracted the requirements, that is to say only those parts that play the role of contractual obligations between the CNES and its subcontractors. Requirements should not contain unnecessary information, such as examples or comments.\nRequirements are intended to be autonomous; they are therefore supposed to have no link with the textual segments which precede or follow them. In the specifications we were given, the requirements were easily identifiable because they were framed by specific tags.\nThe requirements were all written in natural language, but some also contained tables or diagrams (which were removed, since they cannot be analyzed automatically). In theory, they should be fully understandable even without those figures \u2013 but in practice, this is not always the case."}, {"heading": "2.2 Tools and resources", "text": "We used several tools to perform the tasks described in section 3. The syntactic analysis was done using Talismane [18], an open-source parser developed in our laboratory, while the open-source corpus processor Unitex [19] was used for sentence chunking. Short handmade Perl scripts were written for other needs (extraction of the requirements, detection of long sentences, and so on).\nWe also compared our corpus to two other corpora (reduced to the exact same size): (1) a handbook written by experts from the CNES about techniques and technologies used for building and operating spacecraft, intended for semi-experts, and (2) some articles from the French national newspaper Le Monde."}, {"heading": "2.3 INCOSE recommendations", "text": "In order to compare the requirements corpus with a controlled natural language, we used the Guide for Writing Requirements recommendations proposed by INCOSE. The aim of this guide is presented as follows: \u201cto draw together advice from a variety of existing standards into a single, comprehensive set of rules and objectives\u201d (p. 10). It is quite general since it \u201cis intended to cover the expression of requirements from across disciplines\u201d (p. 12). INCOSE is therefore intended for engineers who write or review requirements. It can be clearly considered a \u201cnaturalist\u201d controlled language (as opposed to the \u201cformalist\u201d approach) [20], whose goal is to facilitate human-tohuman communication [21].\nLike many other controlled natural languages (CNL) aimed at improving communication among humans, the main purpose of INCOSE is to ensure that the message written in natural language has only one possible interpretation. It is worth noting that this point of view about natural language is far from the one adopted by linguistics. 1 It can be reasonably assumed, however, that by establishing guidelines in narrowlydefined situations, it may be possible to limit (if not to remove completely) the inherent difficulties linked to natural language such as ambiguity.\nINCOSE has the four characteristics of controlled natural languages proposed by Kuhn [11], since it has one base language (English), it is a constructed language, it sets constraints on the vocabulary, the syntax and the semantics, and the resulting textual requirements are still understandable by English speakers.\nIt is not a mere style guide, because the recommendations are real rules, not hints \u2013 even if the authors admit that \u201crules have to constantly be adapted to particular situations\u201d. All of them are followed by objectives that explain why the rules are useful.\nThe main \u201cobjectives for writing requirement statements\u201d are: singularity, completeness, necessity, comprehensibility, concision, precision and non-ambiguity.\n1 According to Jakobson, for example, the referential function, which is the closest to the one\nconsisting in transmitting information, is only one among the six functions of language [22].\nBecause the phenomena we chose to observe are quite general (i.e. not highly language-dependent), we assume that most of the conclusions we propose for French are valid for English as well. In fact, INCOSE, while written in English and mainly based on older English guides, sometimes gives examples in French.\nSince it was not possible to check the conformity of the requirements to all the recommendations proposed by INCOSE (partly because the study is still in its initial stage, and partly because several of the recommendations cannot be verified in an automated manner), we decided to focus on a selection, all related to what could be called \u201ccomprehensibility\u201d; that is, the fact that every (sentence composing a) requirement should be easily understandable by the reader, and that it cannot be misinterpreted, i.e. given a different meaning from the one originally intended by the writer. This notion is closely connected to that of complexity: the more complex a sentence is, the less easy it is to understand.\nThe first rule from INCOSE that we chose to examine is called \u201cSingularity/Propositionals\u201d and states that \u201ccombinators\u201d must be avoided: \u201cCombinators are words that join clauses together, such as 'and', 'or', 'then', 'unless'. Their presence in a requirement usually indicates that multiple requirements should be written.\u201d Nevertheless, some of them are still present in the examples of \u201cacceptable\u201d specifications; this paradox suggests that the \u201ccombinators\u201d cannot always be avoided.\nThe second rule is called \u201cCompleteness/Pronouns\u201d and states that it is better to repeat nouns in full, rather than using pronouns to refer to nouns in other statements: \u201cPronouns are words such as 'it', 'this', 'that', 'he', 'she', 'they', 'them'. When writing stories, they are a useful device for avoiding the repetition of words; but when writing requirements, pronouns should be avoided, and the proper nouns repeated where necessary.\u201d However, there is no indication about the conditions required for this repetition to be \u201cnecessary\u201d; we can merely infer that the aim is to avoid problems due to anaphora resolution. Besides, in the only example given by INCOSE 2 , the ambiguity lies in a determiner, not in a pronoun.\nWe can already point out that these two rules are very general and seem way too\nrestrictive, and that their justifications are evasive."}, {"heading": "3 First results", "text": "In subsection 3.1, we present our results concerning the frequency of conjunctions, pronouns and long sentences in our corpus. In subsection 3.2, we propose a selection of examples that break the two rules from INCOSE and try to classify them according to their necessity (mandatory, useful or undesirable).\n2 \u201cThe controller shall send the driver's itinary (sic) for the day to the driver\u201d must be pre-\nferred to \u201cThe controller shall send the driver his itinary (sic) for the day\u201d.\nThanks to the syntactic analysis, we were able to retrieve all the occurrences of the so-called combinators (since no exhaustive list was given, we looked for all coordinating and subordinating conjunctions) and all the pronouns in the corpus. As can be seen from table 1, both are numerous, suggesting that they are common in unrestricted natural language.\nStill, they are much less frequent in requirements than in the other two corpora, handbooks and newspapers. This is particularly clear in the case of pronouns, which are nearly three times more frequent in newspapers (where repetition is seen as an error of style in French) than in requirements (which are usually much shorter). We believe that such a marked difference is an argument in favor of our initial hypothesis that regularities spontaneously arise in daily practice, and that requirement writing can be considered a textual genre, even when not taught as such.\nFinally, we also considered the length of the sentences composing the requirements. Although INCOSE simply recommends \u201cconcise\u201d requirements, several guides for technical writing (such as ASD Simplified Technical English [23]) impose a word limit for each sentence4, because it is believed that longer sentences are harder to process. The results of our measures are shown in table 2.\nOnce again, significant differences exist between the three types of documents: sentences tend to be shorter in requirements, and much longer in newspaper articles.\n3 Percentages indicate the number of occurrences in relation to the total number of words. 4 Usually around 20 words for English. We arbitrarily decided that long sentences (in French)\nare composed of more than 25 words, and that a new sentence begins after each line break.\n\u201cSi la diff\u00e9rence (en valeur absolue) entre les dates de fin de lecture de deux fichiers, lus sur tranche de COME M - canal TMI i et sur tranche de COME N - canal TMI j, est inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 OPS_DELAI_INTER_FIN_LEC secondes, alors il est interdit d'encha\u00eener (lecture encha\u00een\u00e9e) par la lecture de la tranche de COME N sur le canal i et de la tranche de COME M sur le canal j.\u201d"}, {"heading": "3.2 Qualitative analysis (analysis of examples)", "text": "As a first step in the diagnosis, we focus on the description of some examples of sentences that do not follow the INCOSE recommendations and try to understand why.\nCombinators\nSome combinators are mandatory:\n(1) \u201cLe g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur de TCH v\u00e9rifiera que la valeur du champ PHASE est comprise\nentre 0 et FREQ_DIV -1.\u201d [\u201cThe generator of TCH will check that the value of the field PHASE is between 0 and FREQ_DIV-1\u201d] In example 1, the subordinating conjunction \u201cque\u201d cannot be avoided, since it introduces the dependent clause 5 , and the coordinating conjunction \u201cet\u201d is necessary to set the lower and higher limits of the interval.\nSome combinators are not mandatory, but prevent repetitions and multiple sentences:\n(2) \u201cLes champs SM_ID et FM_ID seront extraits \u00e0 partir de la BDS\u201d [\u201cFields\nSM_ID and FM_ID will be extracted from the BDS\u201d]\nIf the use of \u201cet\u201d were not allowed in example 2, two distinct sentences would be necessary (\u201cLe champ SM_ID sera extrait \u00e0 partir de la BDS.\u201d and \u201cLe champ FM_ID sera extrait \u00e0 partir de la BDS.\u201d). This would lead to longer and probably more confusing requirements: since the two sentences differ by only a single character, the reader may not notice the difference and think it is a duplicated sentence.\nHowever, longer sentences may become less readable: (3) \u201cCette TC permet de passer contr\u00f4le thermique plate-forme en mode\nREDUCED, c'est-\u00e0-dire de s\u00e9lectionner des seuils de r\u00e9gulation \"larges\" pour le contr\u00f4le thermique grossier (pour limiter la puissance consomm\u00e9e), et de modifier la valeur d'\u00e9cr\u00eatage de la puissance inject\u00e9e pour le contr\u00f4le thermique fin.\u201d [\u201cThis TC makes it possible to switch the heat control of the platform to REDUCED mode, i.e. to select \u201cbroad\u201d regulation thresholds for a coarse heat control (to limit the power consumed), and to change the cut-off value of the injected power for precise heat control.\u201d] In example 3, it would have been better to clearly distinguish the two actions per-\nmitted by the TC \u2013 for example, with a bullet list.\n5 In French, the complementizer \u2018que\u2019 must always be used.\n(4) \u201cpour n=2 la loi de la taille est respect\u00e9e de fait mais le test 'FIFO vide' reste\nn\u00e9cessaire\u201d [\u201cfor n=2 the size rule is always respected, but the \u2018empty FIFO\u2019 test is still required\u201d] In example 4, the reader is certain that the test is necessary in all cases. Without the\nfirst main clause and the logical connector \u201cmais\u201d, he could have doubted it.\nNonetheless, in several cases, the use of a coordinator does not seem justified; in\nparticular when two sentences are coordinated by \u201cand\u201d:\n(5) \u201cLe format des donn\u00e9es de mesure angulaire et Doppler est conforme au\nstandard CCSDS d\u00e9crit dans le document DA9 et le sch\u00e9ma XML respecte le standard d\u00e9crit dans DA11.\u201d [\u201cThe data format of the angular and Doppler measurement is in accordance with the CCSDS standard described in document DA9 and the XML schema complies with the standard described in DA11.\u201d] (6) \u201cLes demandes sont saisies sur le FOS et le logiciel ARPE g\u00e8re les conflits\nentre les demandes Spot, H\u00e9lios et Pl\u00e9\u00efades.\u201d [\u201cThe requests are to be entered on the FOS and the ARPE software manages conflicts between the requests from Spot, H\u00e9lios and Pl\u00e9\u00efades\u201d] In examples 5 and 6, there is no apparent reason why separate sentences should not\nbe used (parataxis).\nIn some cases, problems arise because of the (absence of proper) coordinators:\n(7) \u201cPour cela, on utilisera les donn\u00e9es BDS (LENGTH et LOCATION_UNIT) de\nla table des OBCD (globaux) ou la description (LONGUEUR) des param\u00e8tres diagnostic d\u00e9j\u00e0 cr\u00e9es.\u201d [\u201cFor this, we will use the BDS data (LENGTH and LOCATION_UNIT) from the (global) OBCD table or the description (LONGUEUR) of the already created diagnostic parameters\u201d] In example 7 above, there are two possible solutions (alternative), but no explanation is given to the reader to tell him in which case(s) one of them should be preferred (or whether they are in fact identical).\n(8) \u201cSur r\u00e9ception de cette TC, le LVC met \u00e0 jour la table des surveillances stan-\ndards de l'application destinataire et r\u00e9-initialise le compteur d'erreur (remise \u00e0 0) associ\u00e9 \u00e0 cette surveillance.\u201d [\u201cUpon reception of this TC, the LVC updates the table of standard surveillances of the destination application and resets the error counter associated to this surveillance\u201d] In example 8, we know that the LVC has to do two distinct operations, but it is not\nclear whether they are supposed to be done at the same time or one after the other.\n(9) \u201c(eg : 2 et 10 ou 3 et 11)\u201d [\u201ce.g. : 2 and 10 or 3 and 11)\u201d] In example 9, the priorities of the logical operators \u201cet\u201d and \u201cou\u201d are not clear. (10) \u201cCet ordre est rejet\u00e9 si : [\u201cThis order is rejected if:\u201d]\n- le mode NORM automatique est actif - le satellite est en mode MAN - le satellite n'est pas en mode converg\u00e9 (GAP ou SUP) - un ordre MAN/CAP est d\u00e9j\u00e0 en attente d'ex\u00e9cution\u201d\n(\u201cor\u201d), or only if they are all met (\u201cand\u201d)? Lists of this kind are very common in our corpus.\nPronouns\nSome pronouns must be avoided, because otherwise the requirement is no longer autonomous:\n(11) \u201cIl calculera aussi, a une fr\u00e9quence param\u00e9trable (ordre de grandeur 1 mois),\nla moyenne de mise en \u0153uvre et la comparera \u00e0 la moyenne maximum afin d'anticiper un probl\u00e8me \u00e9ventuel.\u201d [\u201cIt will also calculate, at a frequency that can be parameterized (at monthly intervals), the average time for commissioning and will compare it to the maximum average in order to anticipate any problems.\u201d] The requirement given in example 11 cannot be understood by itself, because the pronoun \u201cil\u201d (\u201cit\u201d) refers to the subject defined in the previous requirement. (And in another requirement, a reference is made to a \u201cpreviously stated rule\u201d, but there is no indication as to which rule is meant.)\nSome pronouns are mandatory:\n(12) \u201cSur r\u00e9ception de cette TC, le LVC met \u00e0 jour le param\u00e8tre qui donne la\ntaille maximum d'un paquet TM de type dump\u201d [\u201cUpon reception of this TC, the LCV updates the parameter that gives the maximum size of a TM dump packet\u201d] Without the relative pronoun \u201cthat\u201d, it would not be possible to specify which pa-\nrameter is referred to in example 12.\n(13) \u201cIl ne sera pas utile de v\u00e9rifier ce paquet \" vide \"\u201d [\u201cIt won\u2019t be necessary to\ncheck that \"empty\" packet\u201d]\nImpersonal pronouns like the one given in example 13 are widespread in our cor-\npus and can hardly be avoided. They do not refer to another noun.\nSome pronouns are not mandatory, but prevent unnecessary repetitions of words:\n(14) \u201cLa liste des TCD est d\u00e9finie en BDS. Elle est donn\u00e9e ici \u00e0 titre informatif:\u201d\n[\u201cThe list of TCD is defined in BDS. It is given here for information:\u201d]\nCompare example 14 with the same sentences without a pronoun: \u201cLa liste des TCD est d\u00e9finie en BDS. La liste des TCD est donn\u00e9e ici \u00e0 titre informatif:\u201d. [\u201cThe list of TCD is defined in BDS.

We showed that, even if they did not explicitly follow guidelines, their texts have some interesting particularities, such as shorter sentences than in other textual genres.\nWe also examined two rules (concerning conjunctions and pronouns) from INCOSE, a guide for writing requirements. Using several examples from our corpus, we considered cases where those rules were justified and others where they were inapplicable (at least if literally applied) and should be refined. In fact, we believe that INCOSE, like the guides it is based on, lacks proper linguistic foundations and is not close enough to engineers\u2019 real practices. For instance, the recommended absence of pronouns from the requirements \u2013 which implies sometimes cumbersome repetitions \u2013 seems hardly compatible with its ideal of \u201cconcision\u201d (itself seen as \u201can aid to Comprehensibility, and therefore subsumed by it\u201d, p. 16).\nIn the future, we intend to conduct a deeper linguistic analysis of our results and to focus on terminology so as to study the use and evolution of terms between comparable corpora. We also want to test the rules of INCOSE on another corpus of requirements. More generally, our intention is to inventory all existing rules in French CNL and to try to automatically test them with our corpora. The final step will be to propose a set of rules that is more consistent and closer to established practice in requirements writing.\nAcknowledgments. We would like to thank the CNES for their active cooperation as well as for providing us with the requirements corpus. We are also grateful to the four reviewers for their relevant suggestions and references."}], "references": [{"title": "Variations in Terminology", "author": ["A.

The aim is to determine to what extent they conform to two rules laid down in INCOSE, a recent guide for writing requirements. Although CNES engineers are not obliged to follow any Controlled Natural Language in their writing of requirements, we believe that language regularities are likely to emerge from this task, mainly due to the writers\u2019 experience.
