Introduction", "text": "The traffic assignment or network equilibrium problem is to predict the steadystate flow of a transportation network [1, 2, 3]. Based on this equilibrium, a traffic network can be designed or managed more effectively [4, 5]. There are many literatures for the traffic assignment problem such as multiple route assignment [6], probabilistic multipath traffic assignment [7] and paired alternative segments\n\u2217Corresponding author: Yong Deng, School of Computer and Information Science, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, China.

However, in reality, the state of a transportation network is always determined by independent travelers who only seek to choose the minimum-cost path between every origin-destination pair. According to this phenomenon, in 1952, Wardrop et al. [9] proposed the user equilibrium principle for the traffic network equilibrium problem. Then, a mathematical model of the user equilibrium is developed by Beckmann et al. [10] in 1956. Based on this model, the dynamic user equilibrium and the stochastic user equilibrium are presented and considered by a lot of researchers [11, 12, 13].\nHowever, in real world, travelers always can not obtain global information of the traffic network, in which many uncertain events may occur at any moment such as traffic accident. Usually these uncertain events can be taken by fuzzy viewpoints [3]. Akiyama et al. [14] develop a model for route choice behavior due to the fuzzy reasoning approach. Henn [15] proposes a fuzzy route choice model by representing travelers with various indices such as risk-taking travelers or risking-averting travelers. Consider the spatial knowledge of individual travelers, Ridwan [16] suggest a fuzzy preference for travel decisions because some travelers do not follow maximizing principles in route choice. Ghatee et al. [3] propose a method based on quasi-logit formulas to obtain a fuzzy equilibrium flow assuming a fuzzy level of travel demand. Many researchers have focused on the fuzzy traffic assignment problem, but, there is not a method dominating the others. Therefore, it is meaningful for us to investigate new method to focus on the fuzzy network equilibrium problem.\nRecently, a large, single-celled amoeba-like organism, Physarum polycephalum,\nwas found to be adaptively capable of solving many graph theoretical problems such as the shortest path found through a maze [17, 18, 19], path selection in networks [20, 21, 22], network design [23, 24]. In this paper, for taking full of advantage of Physarum Polycephalum\u2019s adaptivity in network design, we modify the Physarum-type algorithm to unity the Physarum network and the traffic network so that they can propagate mutually. By this way, the fuzzy user equilibrium can be approached by Physarum Polycephalum. Comparing with other existing algorithms, the main advantage of this algorithm is its adaptivity. To test the performance of this method, some experiments are developed and the results demonstrate that our approach is efficient.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, some preliminaries are presented. In section 3, the proposed method is described. In section 4, experimental results are evaluated. In the final, a brief conclusion is given."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "Some basic theories are shown in this section, including Physarum-type algorithm for shortest path selection, user equilibrium in the traffic network and basic concepts of fuzzy set.\n2.1. Physarum-type algorithm for shortest path selection\nThe shortest path-selection process of Physarum polycephalum is based on the morphogenesis of the tubular structure [18, 25]: on the one hand, high rate of protoplasmic flow stimulates an increase in tubes diameter, whereas tubes tend to decline at low flow rate. Tube thickness therefore adapts to the flow rate. On the other hand, the decrease of tube thickness is accelerated in the illuminated part of the organism. Thus, the tube structure evolves according to a balance of these mutually antagonistic processes. Based on the observed phenomena of the tube structures evolution, a simple Physarum polycephalum model, which takes a mathematically simplified and tractable form, is proposed by Tero et al. [25].\nUsing the graphic illustrated in [25], the model can be described as follows. Each segment in the diagram represents a section of tube. Two special nodes, which are also called food source nodes, are named N1 and N2, and the other nodes are denoted as N3, N4, N5, and so on. The section of tube between Ni and N j is denoted as Mi j. If several tubes connect the same pair of nodes, intermediate nodes will be placed in the center of the tubes to guarantee the uniqueness of the connecting segments. The variable Qi j is used to express the flux through tube Mi j from Ni to N j. Assuming the flow along the tube as an approximately Poiseuille flow, the flux Qi j can be expressed as:\nQi j = \u03c0r4i j(pi \u2212 p j)\n8\u03beLi j = Di j Li j (pi \u2212 p j) (1)\nwhere \u03be is the viscosity coefficient of the sol. Di j = \u03c0r4i j/8\u03be is a measure of the tube conductivity. pi is the pressure at the node Ni. Li j is the length of the edge Mi j.\nAssume zero capacity at each node, \u2211\ni Qi j = 0( j , 1, 2) can be obtained\naccording to the conservation law of sol. For the source node N1 and the sink node N2, \u2211 i Qi1 = \u2212I0 and \u2211 i Qi2 = I0, respectively. I0 is the flux flowing from the source node (or into the sink node). Then the network Poisson equation for the pressure can be obtained as follows:\n\u2211\ni\nDi j Li j (pi \u2212 p j) =  . \u22121 f or j = 1, +1 f or j = 2,\n0 otherwise\n(2)\nBy setting p2 = 0 as the basic pressure level, all pi\u2019s can be determined by solving above equation system, and each Qi j = Di j(pi \u2212 p j)/Li j is also obtained.\nExperimental observation shows that tubes with larger fluxes are reinforced, while those with smaller fluxes degenerate. To accommodate the adaptive behavior of the tubes, all corresponding conductivities Di j\u2019s change in time according to the following equation: d dt Di j = f (|Qi j |) \u2212 aDi j (3) where a is a decay rate of the tube. The functional form f (|Qi j |) is generally given by f (|Qi j |) = |Qi j | for the sake of simplicity [25]. To solve the adaption of Eq. (3), a semi-implicit scheme is used as follows:\nDn+1i j \u2212 D n i j\n\u03b4t = |Qni j| \u2212 D n+1 i j (4)\nwhere \u03b4t is a time mesh size and the upper index n indicates a time step. Hence, the time-varying conductivity Di j generates the state of the system to make the shortest path emerge."}, {"heading": "2.2.

Fuzzy set", "text": "Fuzzy set proposed by Zadeh [27] in 1965 is widely used in many fields such as statistics [28, 29], computer programming [30, 31], engineering and experimental science [32, 33]. Based on this theory, The concept of fuzzy number was first used by Nahmias in the United States and by Dubois and Prade in France in the late 1970s. In this paper, the triangular fuzzy number will be used. Therefore, according to [34, 35],some basic definitions of fuzzy set and fuzzy number are given as follows.\nDefinition 1. A fuzzy set A\u0303 defined on a universe X may be expressed as:\nA\u0303 = {\u2329 x, \u00b5A\u0303 (x) \u232a |x \u2208 X } (8)\nwhere \u00b5A\u0303 \u2192 [0, 1] is the membership function of A\u0303. The membership value \u00b5A\u0303 (x) describes the degree of x \u2208 X in A\u0303.\nDefinition 2. A fuzzy set A\u0303 of X is normal iff supx\u2208X \u00b5A\u0303 (x) = 1. Definition 3. A fuzzy set A\u0303 of X is convex iff \u00b5A\u0303 (\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb) y) \u2265 ( \u00b5A\u0303 (x) \u2227 \u00b5A\u0303 (y) ) , \u2200x, y \u2208 X,\u2200\u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], where \u2227 denotes the minimum operator.\nDefinition 4. A fuzzy set A\u0303 is a fuzzy number iff A\u0303 is normal and convex on X.\nDefinition 5. A triangular fuzzy number A\u0303 is a fuzzy number with a piecewise linear membership function \u00b5A\u0303 defined by:\n\u00b5A\u0303 =  0, x \u2264 a1 x\u2212a1 a2\u2212a1 , a1 \u2264 x \u2264 a2 a3\u2212x a3\u2212a2\n, a2 \u2264 x \u2264 a3 0, a3 \u2264 x\n(9)\nwhich can be denoted as a triplet (a1, a2, a3). A triangular fuzzy number A\u0303 in the universe set X that conforms to this definition shown in Fig. 1.\nBased on [36, 37], fuzzy arithmetic on triangular is shown as follows.\nDefinition 6. Assuming that both A\u0303 = (a1, a2, a3) and B\u0303 = (b1, b2, b3) are triangular numbers, then the basic fuzzy operations are:\nA\u0303 \u2295 B\u0303 = (a1 + b1, a2 + b2, a3 + b3) for addition, (10) A\u0303 \u2296 B\u0303 = (a1 \u2212 b3, a2 \u2212 b2, a3 \u2212 b1) for subtraction, (11) A\u0303 \u2297 B\u0303 = (a1 \u00d7 b1, a2 \u00d7 b2, a3 \u00d7 b3) for multipulation, (12) A\u0303 \u2298 B\u0303 = (a1 / b3 , a2 / b2 , a3 / b1 ) for division. (13)\nDefinition 7. Assuming that both A\u0303 = (a1, a2, a3, a4) and B\u0303 = (b1, b2, b3, b4) are trapezoidal numbers, then the basic fuzzy operations are:\nA\u0303 \u2295 B\u0303 = (a1 + b1, a2 + b2, a3 + b3, a4 + b4) for addition, (14) A\u0303 \u2296 B\u0303 = (a1 \u2212 b4, a2 \u2212 b3, a3 \u2212 b2, a4 \u2212 b1) for subtraction, (15) A\u0303 \u2297 B\u0303 = (a1 \u00d7 b1, a2 \u00d7 b2, a3 \u00d7 b3, a4 \u00d7 b4) for multipulation, (16) A\u0303 \u2298 B\u0303 = (a1 / b4 , a2 / b3 , a3 / b2 , a4 / b1 ) for division. (17)\nFor example, let A\u0303 = (8, 10, 12) and B\u0303 = (4, 5, 6) be two triangular fuzzy\nnumbers. Based on Eqs. 10, four basic operations can be derived as:\nA\u0303 \u2295 B\u0303 = (8, 10, 12) \u2295 (4, 5, 6) = (12, 15, 18) .\nA\u0303 \u2296 B\u0303 = (8, 10, 12) \u2296 (4, 5, 6) = (2, 5, 8) .\nA\u0303 \u2297 B\u0303 = (8, 10, 12) \u2297 (4, 5, 6) = (32, 50, 72) .\nA\u0303 \u2298 B\u0303 = (8, 10, 12) \u2298 (4, 5, 6) = (8/6, 2, 3) .\nThe results of the above operations are depicted in Fig. 2. Recently, fuzzy distance, as a measure of distance between two fuzzy numbers, has gained much attention from researchers and been widely applied in data analysis, classification, and so on [38, 39]. In this paper, the Disp,q-distance proposed in [40] is adopted to measure the difference between two fuzzy numbers.\nDefinition 8. The Disp,q-distance, indexed by parameters 1 < p < \u221e and 0 < q < 1, between two fuzzy numbers A\u0303 and B\u0303 is a nonnegative function given by [40, 41]:\nDisp,q ( A\u0303,B\u0303 ) =  [ (1 \u2212 q) \u222b 1 0 \u2223\u2223\u2223A\u2212\u03b1 \u2212 B\u2212\u03b1 \u2223\u2223\u2223p d\u03b1 + q \u222b 1 0 \u2223\u2223\u2223A+\u03b1 \u2212 B+\u03b1 \u2223\u2223\u2223p d\u03b1 ]1/p , p < \u221e,\n(1 \u2212 q) sup 0<\u03b1\u22641\n(\u2223\u2223\u2223A\u2212\u03b1 \u2212 B\u2212\u03b1 \u2223\u2223\u2223 ) + q inf\n0<\u03b1\u22641\n(\u2223\u2223\u2223A+\u03b1 \u2212 B+\u03b1 \u2223\u2223\u2223 ) , p = \u221e. (18)\nThe analytical properties of Disp,q depend on the first parameter p, while the second parameter q of Disp,q characterizes the subjective weight attributed to the end points of the support. Having q close to 1 results in considering the right side of the support of the fuzzy numbers more favorably. Since the significance of the end points of the support of the fuzzy numbers is assumed to be same, the q = (1/2) is adopted in this paper.\nAccording to studies by Mahdavi et al. [41, 42], with p = 2 and q = (1/2), the general form of fuzzy distance Disp,q can be converted into different forms, as two fuzzy numbers A\u0303 and B\u0303 take different types.\nFor triangular fuzzy numbers A\u0303 = (a1, a2, a3) and B\u0303 = (b1, b2, b3), the fuzzy\ndistance between them can be represented as:\nDis ( A\u0303,B\u0303 ) = \u221a\u221a 1 6  3\u2211\ni=1\n(bi \u2212 ai)2 + (b2 \u2212 a2)2 + \u2211\ni\u2208{1,2}\n(bi \u2212 ai) (bi+1 \u2212 ai+1)  (19)"}, {"heading": "3. Proposed method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1. Fuzzy user equilibrium", "text": "In the model of traditional user equilibrium, a basic assumption is that all travelers know the global information of the traffic network. Based on this, every one can make the decision having no conflict with each other. In reality, however, because of some uncertain events or local information, travelers always need to make the decision according to the fuzzy information of the traffic network. In general, the fuzzy information can be divided into three types [3]: inexact travel cost, unsure network topology and imprecise travel demand. In this paper, we consider the user equilibrium problem in traffic assignment with fuzzy travel cost or fuzzy user equilibrium problem. According to section 2.2, the fuzzy user equilibrium can be stated as follows:\nmin Z\u0303(w) = \u2211\na\u2208A\n\u222b xa\n0 c\u0303a(w)dw, (20)\ns.t.  \u2211 p\u2208P(o,d) f p (o,d) = q(o,d) \u2200(o, d) \u2208 \u03a0, xa = \u2211 (o,d)\u2208\u03a0 \u2211 p\u2208P(o,d) f p (o,d)\u03b4 p,a (o,d) \u2200a \u2208 A,\nf p(o,d) \u2265 0.\n(21)\nwhere c\u0303a(\u00b7) is the fuzzy cost function. It denotes the inaccuracies of perceived time of travelers. For example, one traveler may have a larger perceived travel time of one path than its real travel time while some travelers increase their speed through this paths for some special reasons and a lower if a car accident occurs on this path. For the sake of simplicity, we assign c\u0303a with a triangular fuzzy number. To associate c\u0303a with xa, we use \u03b1l and \u03b1r to extend xa. Therefore, c\u0303a can be calculated as follows:\nc\u0303a = (ca[(1 \u2212 \u03b1l)x a], ca(xa), ca[(1 + \u03b1r)x a]) (22)\nwhere ca[(1 \u2212 \u03b1l)xa] is the left limit and ca[(1 + \u03b1r)xa] is the right limit of ca, respectively. The advantage of using such a strategy is it considers link capacity as an effective factor in traffic assignment [43].\n3.2. Physarum-type algorithm for fuzzy user equilibrium algorithm\nAccording to the network structure, Physarum Polycephalum is able to make full use of its protoplasm (flow) for building a new network (Physarum network) based on its adaptivity [23]. To take full of advantage of this feature for fuzzy user equilibrium problem, it is necessary for us to find out the similarities and differences between the Physarum network and the traffic network, and then to find a way to unify the Physarum network and the traffic network. Therefore, some modifications of Physarum-type algorithm should be carried out.\nThere are many similar properties between the Physarum network and the traffic network. As a result, we can treat the links in the traffic network as the tubes in Physarum network, the traffic flow as the protoplasm, the traffic nodes as the food sources and the cost as the distance. Meanwhile, there are some differences between them. For example, in reality, the traffic nodes have many their own features such as education center, political centers and transportation hubs. Besides, the traffic flow is always determined by many factors such as the choices of travelers, the accidents and the transport facilities. While in the Physarum network, the protoplasm in the tubes only flow from the high-pressure node to the low-pressure node.\nBased on these similarities and differences, we rewrite some formulas of Physarum-\ntype algorithm to unify the Physarum network and the traffic network. Firstly, consider the distance of tubes and the cost of links:\nL\u0303i j = c\u0303 a, i, j \u2208 N (23)\nwhere arc from node i to node j is equal to link a. Like [21], fuzzy cost c\u0303a can be\ndenoted as (cal , c a, car ). Then, Eq. 2 can be rewrite as follows:\n\u2211\ni\nDi j cal (pli \u2212 p l j) =  . \u2212q(o,d) f or j = 1, +q(o,d) f or j = 2,\n0 otherwise.\n\u2211\ni\nDi j ca (pi \u2212 p j) =  . \u2212q(o,d) f or j = 1, +q(o,d) f or j = 2,\n0 otherwise.\n\u2211\ni\nDi j car (pri \u2212 p r j) =  . \u2212q(o,d) f or j = 1, +q(o,d) f or j = 2,\n0 otherwise.\n(24)\nwhere p\u0303i = (pli, pi, p r i ), i \u2208 N is associated with the fuzzy cost c\u0303 a. According to p\u0303i, the p\u0303(o,d) can be obtained for each (o, d) pair. Then, the globe pressure p\u0303(O,D) can be calculated as follows:\np\u0303(O,D) = \u2211\n(o,d)\u2208\u03a0\np\u0303(o,d) (25)\nNext, xa can be calculated as follows:\nxa = Di j \u00d7 Dis( p\u0303i c\u0303a , p\u0303 j c\u0303a ), p\u0303i, p\u0303 j \u2208 p\u0303(O,D) (26)\nwhere Dis(\u00b7) is the function of fuzzy distance measure. Finally, according to Eq. 4 and xa, Di j is obtain as follows:\nDn+1i j \u2212 D n i j\n\u03b4t = |(xa)n| \u2212 Dn+1i j (27)\nwhere \u03b4t is a time mesh size and the upper index n indicates a time step."}, {"heading": "4.
