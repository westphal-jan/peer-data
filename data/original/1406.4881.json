Introduction", "text": "In this article we refer to LOGOMON system developed in\nTERAPERS project by the authors. The full system is used for personalized therapy of dyslalia affecting pre scholars (children with age between 4 and 7). Dyslalia is a speech disorder that affect pronunciation of one ore many sounds. According to the statistics, about 10% of pre scholars are affected by this type of speech impairment [1].\nThe objectives of LOGOMON system are:\n- initial and during therapy evaluation of volunteer children and\nidentification of a modality of standardizing their progresses and regresses (physiological and behavioral parameters);\n- the development of an expert system for the personalized therapy\nof speech impairments that will allow for designing a training path for pronunciation, individualized according to the defect category, previous experience and the child\u2019s therapy previous evolution; - the development of a therapeutically guide that will allow\nmixing classical methods with the adjuvant procedures of the audio visual system and the design of a database that will contain the set of exercises and the results obtained by the child. All these activities are currently completed and the therapy system\nis tested by Interschool Regional Speech Therapy Center of Suceava, Romania.\nThe figure 1 presents the menus of LOGOMON (Administrative\nTasks, Complex Examination, Therapy Organizer, Therapy Steps, Reports, Special Operations, About, Exit).\nhelping the people with such disorders because of highly social and affective implications.\nForward we enumerate most important projects related with\nspeech therapy area:\n- OLP (Ortho-Logo-Paedia) - develop in \u201eEU Quality of Life and\nManagement of Living Resources\u201d interest area with coordination of Institute for Language and Speech Processing, Athena, Greek, with participation of France (Arches), Greek (Logos Centre for Speech-Voice Pathology), Spain (Universidad Politecnica de Madrid), Sweden (KTH- Royal Institute of Technology) and Great Britain (Sheffield University, Barnsley District General Hospital) [2], [3]; - ARTUR (ARticulation TUtoR) \u2013 one of the most recently speech\ntherapy system [4], [5], still develop in 2006 year, with coordination of KTH-Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden; - STAR (Speech Training, Assessment and Remediation) \u2013 a\nsystem develop by Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children and University of Delaware for help speech therapist and children with speech problems [6]; - MMTTS-CSD (Multimedia, Multilingual Teaching and Training\nSystem for Children with Speech Disorders) \u2013 a complex project develop by University of Reading \u2013 Anglia, Budapest University of Technology and Economics \u2013 Ungaria, University of Maribor \u2013 Slovenia and Kungl. Tekniska Hogskolan, Sweden [7]. At the national level, little research has been conducted on the\ntherapy of speech impairments, out of which mostly is focused on traditional areas such as voice recognition, voice synthesis and voice authentication. Although there are a lot of children with speech disorder, the methods used today in logopaedia are mostly based on individual work with each child. The few existent computer assisted programs in Romania don\u2019t provide any feedback. At international level, there are software applications but quite expensive and improper for the phonetic specific of Romanian language.\ndyslalia therapy. In complex examination, speech therapist collects the base set of data used for child diagnostic.\nSpeech examination has two distinct levels [8]:\n- examination of hear, voice, grammatical and linguistic skills; - speech production (articulator system and vocal production).\nTherapeutically program has two steps [9]:\n- generally therapy (mobility development exercises, air flow\ncontrol, hear development);\n- specific therapy (sound pronunciation, consolidation and\ndifferentiation).\nIn according with [1], speech therapy software can help speech\nproblems diagnostic, can offer a real-time, audio-visual feedback, can improve analyze of child progress and can extend speech therapy at child home.\ntherapist decisions. A software interface was developed for validation of the system.The main objectives of this task are:\n- personalized therapy (the therapy must be in according with\nchild\u2019s problems level, context and possibilities);\n- speech therapist assistant (the expert system offer some\nsuggestion regarding what exercises are better for a specific moment and from a specific child); - (self)teaching (when system\u2019s conclusion is different that speech\ntherapist\u2019s conclusion the last one must have the knowledge base change possibility).\naspects of reality. In the latest years, many fuzzy expert systems were developed [10], [11]. In figure 3 we present an example of fuzzy inference, using three input linguistic variables (speech problems level, family implication and children age) and one output linguistic variable (weekly session number).\nFirst three variables have following textual representation: speech_problems_level (1.62) = {\u201clow\u201d/0.37,\u201dnormal\u201d/0.62,\u201dhigh\u201d/0.0} family_implication (2.00) = {\u201creduce\u201d/0.0,\u201dmoderate\u201d/1.0,\u201dhigh\u201d/0.0} children_age (4.50) = {\u201csmall\u201d/0.25,\u201dmedium\u201d/0.5,\u201dbig\u201d/0.0} We consider five rules for illustrate the inference steps:\n- IF (speech_problems_level is high) and (child_age is medium) and (family_implication is reduce) THEN weekly_session_number is high; min (0.00, 0.50, 0.00) = 0.00 for linguistic term high\n- IF (speech_problems_level is low) and (child_age is small) and\n(family_implication is moderate) THEN weekly_session_number is low; min (0.37, 0.25, 1.00) = 0.25 for linguistic term low\n- IF (speech_problems_level is low) and (child_age is medium) and\n(family_implication is moderate) THEN weekly_session_number is low; min (0.37, 0.50, 1.00) = 0.37 for linguistic term low\n- IF (speech_problems_level is normal) and (child_age is small) and\n(family_implication is moderate) THEN weekly_session_number is normal min (0.62, 0.25, 1.00) = 0.25 for linguistic term normal\n- IF (speech_problems_level is normal) and (child_age is medium) and\n(family_implication is moderate\nTHEN weekly_session_number is normal min (0.62, 0.5, 1.00) = 0.50 for linguistic term normal\nFinal coefficients levels are obtained using max function: high = max (0.00) = 0.00; low = max (0.25, 0.37) = 0.37; normal = max (0.25, 0.50) = 0.50\nEach linguistic term of output variable has another representation\nand in this manner is obtained final graphical representation of weekly_session_number variable. If system user wants to get a single output value, then area center of gravity is calculated. In our case\nWe implement over 150 fuzzy rules for control various aspects of\npersonalized therapy. These rules are currently validated by speech therapists and can be modified in a distributed manner. We also develop a Java expert engine interface in order to test our knowledge base [9], [12]."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We must specify that these researches are part of TERAPERS\nproject financed by the National Agency for Scientific Research, Romania, INFOSOC program (contract number: 56-CEEX-II03/27.07.2006).\nReferences\n[1] Tobolcea Iolanda, Logo-therapeutic intervention in order to help children\nwith speech problems, Iasi, Romania, Spanda press 2002.\n[2] Oster Anne-Marie, House David, Protopapas Athanassios, Presentation of a\nnew EU project for speech therapy: OLP (Ortho-Logo-Paedia), Proceedings of Fonetik, pp. 45-48, Greek, 2002.\n[3] Hatzis A., Kalikow DN, Stevens KN, OPTICAL LOGO-THERAPY (OLT) -\nA computer based speech training system for the visualization of articulation using connectionist techniques, Proceedings of Fonetik, pp. 125-131, Greek, 2002.\n[4] B\u00e4lter, O., Engwall, O., \u00d6ster, A-M., & Kjellstr\u00f6m, H., Wizard-of-Oz Test of\nARTUR - a Computer-Based Speech Training System with Articulation Correction, Proceedings of the 7-th International ACM SIGACCES Conference on Computers and Accessibility, pp. 36-43, Baltimore, USA, 2005.\n[5] Eriksson Elina, Balter Olle, Engwall Olov, Oster Anne-Marie, Kjellstrom\nHedvig, Design Recommendations for a Computer-Based Speech Training System Based on End-User Interviews, Proceedings of International Conference On Speech And Computer, pp. 483\u2013486, Patras, Greece, 2005.\n[6] Bunnel H.
