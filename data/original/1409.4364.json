INTRODUCTION\nWord search in Sanskrit E-texts is a problem that is beset with complexities, unlike in the case of English E-texts. The problem assumes relevance in the context of the availability of rapidly increasing numbers of ancient Sanskrit texts [5-9] in the electronic format. The importance of n-gram analysis of Sanskrit texts for scholars and the tremendous utility of locating specific words in a variety of texts to aid the scholastic process can hardly be overemphasized.\nDating of a text, fixing its authorship with certainty, and analysis of the writing style of an author of a text, are some of the areas in which n-grams assume criticality especially in the context of ancient Sanskrit works. Quoting from authoritative texts is imperative in scholarly works, and word searches can provide crucial help in this regard. Locating the portion in a text or texts in which a particular usage or word is found is of great importance to scholars who write explanatory treatises of Sanskrit-based works in English and other languages. Semantic analysis and understanding of texts are facilitated by finding occurrences of words and studying them in different contexts. In fact, ancient Sanskrit works are universally acknowledged as being mines of information on a whole spectrum of disciplines,\nand hence finding actual occurrences of words is of great consequence to not only Sanskrit scholars but to also researchers from various other disciplines ranging from philosophy, theology, the arts and the physical and life sciences to sociology, medicine and astronomy.\nII. THE PROBLEM\nAs stated above, there are complexities involved in searching comprehensively for words in a Sanskrit E-text. One of the major contributors to this complexity is the operation of euphonic conjunctions or \u2018sandhis\u2019. A sandhi is a point in a word or between words, at which adjacent letters coalesce and transform [3]. This is a common feature in many Indian languages as against European languages, and has far-reaching consequences in Sanskrit. The transformation caused by the application of rules of sandhi in Sanskrit can be significant enough to alter the word itself to such a degree that the transformed word would not show up in a simple word search.\nFor example, the word \u2018asamardhi\u1e25\u2019 (meaning of unmatched affluence), can be transformed into \u2018\u0101samardhi\u1e25\u2019 because of the operation of a euphonic conjunction with a word ending in \u2018a\u2019 preceding it, or \u2018\u0101samardhir\u2019 or \u2018\u0101samardhis\u2019 in combination with words occurring after it or \u2018asamarddhi\u1e25\u2019 or \u2018asamardddhi\u1e25\u2019 by internal transformation. Clearly, simply searching for the word asamardhi\u1e25 would not yield the occurrences of the same word as \u2018asamarddhir\u2019, \u2018\u0101samardddhir\u2019, or other alternative forms. As such, a normal text-search using a Unicode text editor would not suffice. Other search engines currently used for Sanskrit [13] too do not provide for such comprehensive searching.\nIn order to achieve such an exhaustive search, all possible forms of the word resulting from the euphonic conjunctions that would become operative in its case must be generated and searched for in the given text.\nThe authors have already presented a new schema for fast sandhi processing in earlier work [4]. The present work extends the application of that schema to other sandhi rules including\n64 http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/ ISSN 1947-5500\nconsonant-based and visarga-based sandhis as well as important rules with respect to exceptional cases. It further presents a complete computational algorithm to process all sandhis, and an algorithm to apply this sandhi-processing procedure to generate all word forms to enable comprehensive searching."}, {"heading": "A. Language Representation", "text": "The Unicode hexadecimal range 0900 - 097F is used to represent Sanskrit characters in Devan\u0101gar\u012b script. The characters used to represent Sanskrit letters in English script are found in the Basic Latin (0000-007F), Latin-1 Supplement (0080-00FF), Latin Extended-A (0100-017F) and Latin Extended Additional (1E00 \u2013 1EFF) Unicode ranges.\nThe Latin character set has been employed in this work to represent Sanskrit letters as E-text. As such, the schema and algorithms presented do not use Devan\u0101gar\u012b script. To use the algorithms for text that is in Devan\u0101gar\u012b script, the text needs to first be converted to Latin text."}, {"heading": "B. Terminology", "text": "The terminology employed in this work for certain groups of letters of the Sanskrit alphabet is given in Table 1.\nderivational and known for their mathematical precision in spite of dealing with the nuances of the language at various levels including morphology, syntax, semantics, phonology and pragmatics. Owing to the cryptic nature of the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b, one or more of the commentaries on it are required to get a clear understanding of its contents.\nThe current work deals with P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s sandhi-related aphorisms with the help of the recognized commentaries, Siddh\u0101nta-kaumud\u012b [1] and K\u0101\u015bik\u0101 [2]. Both these commentaries are accepted by Sanskrit scholars as authoritative works on P\u0101\u1e47inian grammar.\nP\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s statements of grammatical rules are expressed on the basis of the M\u0101he\u015bvara-s\u016btras, or the \u2018aphorisms of Mahe\u015bvara\u2019. These aphorisms provide a list of all the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet ordered in a specific sequence. The M\u0101he\u015bvara aphorisms are given below:\n1. a-i-u-\u1e47 2. \u1e5b-\u1e37-k 3. e-o-\u1e45 4. ai-au-c 5. ha-ya-va-ra-\u1e6d 6. la-\u1e47 7. \u00f1a-ma-\u1e45a-\u1e47a-na-m 8. jha-bha-\u00f1 9. gha-\u1e0dha-dha-\u1e63 10. ja-ba-ga-\u1e0da-da-\u015b 11. kha-pha-cha-\u1e6dha-tha-ca-\u1e6da-ta-v 12. ka-pa-y 13. \u015ba-\u1e63a-sa-r 14. ha-l\nThe last letter in each of these aphorisms is only a placeholder. The first four aphorisms list only the short forms of all the vowels, while the rest list the semi-vowels and consonants; the latter list has the vowel \u2018a\u2019 appended to each letter only to enable pronunciation of the aphorism."}, {"heading": "A. The Approach", "text": "The present work is based on earlier work by the authors, which directly codifies P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s rules in a novel way using binary representations [4]. The unique data representation devised by the authors has been further refined in this work and consonant-based, visarga-based sandhi rules, as well as some special sandhi rules have been included in this work.\nRule representation has been simplified to minimal binary set-unset operations. Further, the s\u016btra ordering has been done after acquiring a thorough understanding of the operation of P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s sandhi-related aphorisms. As such, this work presents a significant extension, refinement and closure of the earlier work of the authors. Moreover, it provides a clear understanding of the rules governing sandhi as laid down by P\u0101\u1e47ini, in a comprehensive and simplified way, hitherto not encountered in the literature."}, {"heading": "B. The Binary Schema", "text": "The following is an extract from already published work by the authors [4] and is included here for completeness of the presentation.\n65 http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/ ISSN 1947-5500\nA point of sandhi is denoted by \ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc66\nwhere \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc66 denote the sandhi letters and the symbol \u2018+\u2019 denotes adjacency. The variable \ud835\udc4b denotes the sequence of letters culminating in \ud835\udc65; the variable \ud835\udc4c denotes the sequence of letters starting with \ud835\udc66. The notations \ud835\udc4b and \ud835\udc4c are used to depict special conditions that pertain to an entire word or sequence of letters involved in the sandhi rule. The letter immediately preceding \ud835\udc65 and the letter immediately succeeding \ud835\udc66 are denoted respectively as \ud835\udc62 and \ud835\udc64 respectively.\nThe refined schematic developed in this work to represent letters of the Sanskrit alphabet is given in Table 2.\n# Letters\n45 ' 46 #\nIn Table 2, x is the jihv\u0101m\u016bliy\u0101 and f is the upadhm\u0101n\u012bya mentioned in Table 1; the # symbol stands for \u2018ru\u2019 a special intermediary form of the semi-vowel r.\nAny letter of the alphabet is represented in two parts: Part 1 denotes the category to which a letter belongs (zero-based serial number in Table 2), and Part 2 denotes the zero-based term number within the series that the letter is or fits into. In any letter representation, Part 1 is a binary string of fixed length 46, in which the set bit denotes the category number, while Part 2 is a binary string of maximum length 6 in which the set bit indicates which particular letter is being represented. It is clear that one letter has many representations under this scheme.\nThe first four shaded rows of Table 2 stand for overall categories, viz. vowels, semi-vowels, consonants and special characters respectively. One of these four bits have to be set in any letter representation. There is no corresponding Part 2 value for the bits 0, 1, 2 and 3 of Part 1.\nFor simplicity of presentation, sandhi rules use the following notation: \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc5b) = 1 indicates that the \ud835\udc5bth bit of Part \ud835\udc56 of the variable \ud835\udc65 is set, where \ud835\udc56 = 1, 2. In the implementation, the checks for bit set can be done by simply using the XOR operation.\nIV. SANDHI PROCESSING UNDER THE P\u0100\u1e46INIAN SYSTEM Each of the eight chapters of P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b is divided into four parts or p\u0101das. Overall, the work is defined by P\u0101\u1e47ini as consisting of two parts, the sap\u0101dasapt\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b (the aphorisms of Chapters 1.1 to 8.1), and the trip\u0101d\u012b (the aphorisms of Chapters 8.2 to 8.4).\nThe order in which the rules should be visited was arrived at in this work after a thorough study of P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s aphorisms with respect to euphonic conjunctions. As a result of the study, the set of sandhi rules has been split into two in this work: Set 1, having all the relevant aphorisms of the sap\u0101dasapt\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b as well as a few specific rules from the trip\u0101d\u012b, and Set 2, having all the remaining relevant aphorisms of the trip\u0101d\u012b.\nThe order of parsing is as follows: rules in Set 1 are parsed in reverse order of their A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b order; rules in Set 2 are parsed in the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b order itself. (The s\u016btra number as it appears in the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b is indicated in the algorithm between double pipe symbols given after the s\u016btra.)This parsing order is adopted so that no rule already parsed has to be parsed again. As such, the flow of the program is just from top to bottom. There are exceptions to the above parsing orders in both sets that arise because of certain overruling s\u016btras that appear earlier / later respectively in the two sets. The ordering is changed to accommodate such rules in such a way as to parse them before the main rule.\nAssuming that the rules are ordered in the above manner in the two sets, the following general algorithm for parsing rules is presented. The word_list is a list of the alternative word-pair outputs generated, and represents the output at the end of the algorithm.\n66 http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/ ISSN 1947-5500\nAlgorithm SandhiRulesParser\n{\nwhile Set 1 rules have not been fully visited {\nTry the next rule in Set 1; if the rule applies {\nApply the rule and store the output; if the rule is optional {\nAdd the current word pair to the word_list; Continue checking from the next rule for all\nword pairs stored in the word_list; }\nelse {\nProcess internal sandhi rules of Set 2; }\n}\n} while Set 2 rules have not been fully visited {\nTry the next rule in Set 2; if the rule applies {\nApply the rule and transform the given words; if the rule is optional {\nAdd the current word pair to the word_list; Continue checking from the next rule for all\nword pairs stored in the word_list; }\n}\n}\n} There are a few exceptions that would apply to the general processing order prescribed by the above algorithm. For example, in Set 1 the output produced by an optionally applying rule does, in certain cases, have to pass through a rule appearing below and undergo further transformation as a result, as it happens in Set 2. Also, it is found that a few rare rules of Set 2 have to be processed before Set 1. Further, in Set 2, all rules that form exceptions to a particular rule are stated after it by P\u0101\u1e47ini, but clearly, have to be processed before the rule by the algorithm.\nV. THE SANDHI PROCESSOR\nThe key to symbols used in rule coding and algorithm specification is as follows:\n // means single-line explanatory comment  { } are block or set indicators  \u2227 denotes \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51  \u2228 denotes \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f  \u00ac denotes \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61  \u2a01 denotes \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f  | denotes word concatenation\nThe algorithm SandhiProcessor processes the rules pertaining to all the major sandhis in Sanskrit grammar, in accordance with the processing scheme presented in Algorithm SandhiRulesParser. Set 1 and Set2 sandhis have been incorporated here one below the other and the rules have been codified as per the schema presented above. The vowel sandhis presented in [4] have been modified in accordance to the reduced schema and included here for completeness.\nWhen \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56 , etc., for i = 1,2, are assigned new values by setting bits, it is assumed that their initial values are first unset. Also, if either part of a variable is not set, it is assumed to remain unchanged. Further, it is also assumed that a category change caused by a sandhi will cause an automatic change in the first four bits of the letter representation and that all bit representations for the changed letter will be generated thereafter. Hence, these aspects are not explicitly stated for each rule in this algorithm.\nThe speed of processing is increased by going into a rule only if overall conditions are satisfied. For instance, if the rule is a vowel sandhi rule, where both x and y are required to be vowels, then the check if \ud835\udc651(0) and \ud835\udc661(0) are 1 is first made. If this bit-check is not true for the input words, then a whole set of vowel sandhis is omitted from the parse, thus increasing the efficiency of the algorithm. These overall checks have not been shown in the algorithm presented below, in order to make the presentation more simple.\nAlgorithm SandhiProcessor (\ud835\udc4b,\ud835\udc4c) {\n//1.svaujasamau\u1e6dcha\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101bhy\u0101\u1e41bhis\u1e45ebhy\u0101\u1e41bhyas\u1e45asi //bhy\u0101\u1e41bhyas\u1e45asos\u0101m\u1e45yossup || 4.1.2 || //If there is a visarga (\u1e25) at the end of \ud835\udc4b, then the visarga is //changed to \u2018s\u2019. \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc651(44) {\n\ud835\udc651(24) = 1;

CONCLUSION\nThe schema developed in this work presents a simple yet unique and efficient method to process the sandhi aphorisms of P\u0101\u1e47ini. The letter representation scheme is binary, and hence all the checks are implemented as bit-level operations and simple bit-set and bit-unset operations suffice to carry out the sandhi transformation. The efficiency is further enhanced by the division of a letter representation into two parts and the consequent reduction of the transformation process to a shifting of category. Further, this pattern of solving the sandhi construction problem is unprecedented in the literature. Thus, representation schema and the results of the sandhi-processing\n75 http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/ ISSN 1947-5500\nalgorithm represent an efficient computational model to process Sanskrit euphonic conjunctions. It must be mentioned here that some rules such as those with regard to prak\u1e5btibh\u0101va sandhi (non-transformational sandhi) have not been presented above. However, it is clear that their implementation is only an extension of the algorithm presented in this work that does not require any new schema.\nThe representational schema has been reduced further from [4] in this work, since many more sandhi rules have been incorporated here. The optimality of the schema is clear from the simplicity of the rule representation.\nThe final algorithm presented in this work, which uses this sandhi processor for word searches in E-texts is the first of its kind in the literature with regard to Sanskrit.\nThe use of the sandhi processor for searching ensures comprehensiveness of the search, while the efficiency of the sandhi processing method presented in this work ensures that search speeds are not compromised due to the increase in the number of words to be searched for. This was confirmed in the implementation of the algorithm.\nThe algorithms presented in this work have been tested for use with Sanskrit E-text in Devan\u0101gar\u012b script after a conversion engine converted Devan\u0101gar\u012b Unicode to Latin Unicode E-text.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D\u012bk\u1e63ita Bha\u1e6d\u1e6doji, Siddh\u0101nta-kaumud\u012b, Translated by \u015ar\u012b\u015ba Candra Vasu, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidas Publishers, Delhi, 1962.
