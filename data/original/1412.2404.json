These applications include image representation and compression [6], systems theory [12], image segmentation [15], motion segmentation [13], face clustering [7, 5] and texture segmentation [8], to name a few. Dimensionality reduction is generally used prior to applying these methods because most of these algorithms optimize expensive loss functions like nuclear norm, `1 regularization, e.t.c. Most of these applications simply apply off-the-shelf dimensionality reduction techniques or resize images (in case of image data) as a pre-processing step.\nThe union of independent subspace model can be thought of as a generalization of the traditional approach of representing a given set of data points using a single low dimensional subspace (e.g. Principal Component Analysis). For the application of algorithms that model data at hand with this independence assumption, the subspace structure of the data needs to be preserved after dimensionality reduction. Although a number of existing dimensionality reduction techniques [10, 3, 1, 4] try to preserve the spacial geometry of any given data, no prior work has tried to explicitly preserve the independence between subspaces to the best of our knowledge.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction technique that preserves independence between multiple subspaces. In order to achieve this, we first show that for any two disjoint subspaces with arbitrary dimensionality, there exists a two dimensional subspace such that both the\nar X\niv :1\n41 2.\n24 04\nv1 [\ncs .L\nsubspaces collapse to form two lines.

SK be K subspaces in Rn. We say that these K subspaces are independent if there does not exist any non-zero vector in Si which is a linear combination of vectors in the other K \u2212 1 subspaces. Let the columns of the matrix Bi \u2208 Rn\u00d7d denote the support of the ith subspace of d dimensions. Then any vector in this subspace can be represented as x = Biw \u2200w \u2208 Rd. Now we define the notion of margin between two subspaces.\nDefinition 1 (Subspace Margin) Subspaces Si and Sj are separated by margin \u03b3ij if\n\u03b3ij = max u\u2208Si,v\u2208Sj \u3008u, v\u3009 \u2016u\u20162\u2016v\u20162\n(1)\nThus margin between any two subspaces is defined as the maximum dot product between two unit vectors (u, v), one from either subspace. Such a vector pair (u, v) is known as the principal vector pair between the two subspaces while the angle between these vectors is called the principal angle.\nWith these definitions of independent subspaces and margin, assume that we are given a dataset which has been sampled from a union of independent linear subspaces. Specifically, each class in this dataset lies along one such independent subspace. Then our goal is to reduce the dimensionality of this dataset such that after projection, each class continues to lie along a linear subspace and that each such subspace is independent of all others. Formally, let X = [X1, X2 . . . , XK ] be a K class dataset in Rn such that vectors from class i (x \u2208 Xi) lie along subspace Si.

Further, each subspace S\u0304i (i \u2208 {1 . . .K}) is independent of all others."}, {"heading": "3 Proposed Approach", "text": "In this section, we propose a novel subspace learning approach applicable to labeled datasets that theoretically guarantees independent subspace structure preservation. The number of projection vectors required by our approach is not only independent of the size of the dataset but is also fixed, depending only on the number of classes. Specifically, we show that for any K class labeled dataset with independent subspace structure, only 2K projection vectors are required for structure preservation.\nThe entire idea of being able to find a fixed number of projection vectors for the structure preservation of a K class dataset is motivated by theorem 2. This theorem states a useful property of any pair of disjoint subspaces.\nTheorem 2 Let unit vectors v1 and v2 be the ith principal vector pair for any two disjoint subspaces S1 and S2 in Rn. Let the columns of the matrix P \u2208 Rn\u00d72 be any two orthonormal vectors in the span of v1 and v2. Then for all vectors x \u2208 Sj , PTx = \u03b1tj (j \u2208 {1, 2}), where \u03b1 \u2208 R depends on x and tj \u2208 R2 is a fixed vector independent of x. Further, t T 1 t2\n\u2016t1\u20162\u2016t2\u20162 = v T 1 v2\nProof: We use the notation (M)j to denote the jth column vector of matrix M for any arbitrary matrix M . We claim that tj = PT vj (j \u2208 {1, 2}). Also, without any loss of generality, assume that (P )1 = v1. Then in order to prove theorem 2, it suffices to show that \u2200x \u2208 S1, (P )T2 x = 0. By symmetry, \u2200x \u2208 S2, PTx will also lie along a line in the subspace spanned by the columns of P . Let the columns ofB1 \u2208 Rn\u00d7d1 andB2 \u2208 Rn\u00d7d2 be the support of S1 and S2 respectively, where d1 and d2 are the dimensionality of the two subspaces. Then we can represent v1 and v2 as v1 = B1w1 and v2 = B2w2 for some w1 \u2208 Rd1 and w2 \u2208 Rd2 . Let B1w be any arbitrary vector in S1 where\nw \u2208 Rd1 . Then we need to show that T := (B1w)T (P )2 = 0\u2200w. Notice that,\nT = (B1w) T (B2w2 \u2212 (wT1 BT1 B2w2)B1w1)\n= wT (BT1 B2w2 \u2212 (wT1 BT1 B2w2)w1) \u2200w (2)\nLet USV T be the svd of BT1 B2. Then w1 and w2 are the i th columns of U and V respectively, and vT1 v2 is the i th diagonal element of S if v1 and v2 are the ith principal vectors of S1 and S2. Thus,\nT = wT (USV Tw2 \u2212 Sii(U)i) = wT (Sii(U)i \u2212 Sii(U)i) = 0\n(3)\nGeometrically, this theorem says that after projection on the plane (P ) defined by any one of the principal vector pairs between subspaces S1 and S2, both the entire subspaces collapse to just two lines such that points from S1 lie along one line while points from S2 lie along the second line. Further, the angle that separates these lines is equal to the angle between the ith principal vector pair between S1 and S2 if the span of the ith principal vector pair is used as P .\nWe apply theorem 2 on a three dimensional example as shown in figure 1. In figure 1 (a), the first subspace (y-z plane) is denoted by red color while the second subspace is the black line in x-y axis. Notice that for this setting, the x-y plane (denoted by blue color) is in the span of the 1st (and only) principal vector pair between the two subspaces. After projection of both the entire subspaces onto the x-y plane, we get two lines (figure 1 (b)) as stated in the theorem.\nFinally, we now show that for any K class dataset with independent subspace structure, 2K projection vectors are sufficient for structure preservation.\nTheorem 3 Let X = {x}Ni=1 be a K class dataset in Rn with Independent Subspace structure. Let P = [P1 . . . PK ] \u2208 Rn\u00d72K be a projection matrix for X such that the columns of the matrix Pk \u2208 Rn\u00d72 consists of orthonormal vectors in the span of any principal vector pair between subspaces Sk and \u2211 j 6=k Sj . Then the Independent Subspace structure of the dataset X is preserved after projection on the 2K vectors in P .\nBefore stating the proof of this theorem, we first state lemma 4 which we will use later in our proof. This lemma states that if two vectors are separated by a non-zero angle, then after augmenting these vectors with any arbitrary vectors, the new vectors remain separated by some non-zero angle as well. This straightforward idea will help us extend the two subspace case in theorem 2 to multiple subspaces.\nLemma 4 Let x1, y1 be any two fixed vectors of same dimensionality with respect to each other such that x T 1 y1\n\u2016x1\u20162\u2016y1\u20162 = \u03b3 where \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1). Let x2, y2 be any two arbitrary vectors of same dimensionality with respect to each other. Then there exists a constant \u03b3\u0304 \u2208 [0, 1) such that vectors x\u2032 = [x1;x2] and y\u2032 = [y1; y2] are also separated such that x \u2032T y\u2032\n\u2016x\u2032\u20162\u2016y\u2032\u20162 \u2264 \u03b3\u0304.\nProof:\nx\u2032T y\u2032 \u2016x\u2032\u20162\u2016y\u2032\u20162 = xT1 y1 + x T 2 y2 \u2016x\u2032\u20162\u2016y\u2032\u20162\n= \u03b3\u2016x1\u20162\u2016y1\u20162 + xT2 y2\n\u2016x\u2032\u20162\u2016y\u2032\u20162\n< \u2016x1\u20162\u2016y1\u20162 + xT2 y2 \u2016x\u2032\u20162\u2016y\u2032\u20162\n\u2264 max x2,y2 \u2016x1\u20162\u2016y1\u20162 + xT2 y2 \u2016x\u2032\u20162\u2016y\u2032\u20162 = 1\n(4)\nProof of theorem 3: For the proof of theorem 3, it suffices to show that data vectors from subspaces Sk and \u2211\nj 6=k Sj (for any k \u2208 {1 . . .K}) are separated by margin less than 1 after projection using P . Let x and y be any vectors in Sk and \u2211 j 6=k Sj respectively and the columns of the matrix Pk be in the span of the ith (say) principal vector pair between these subspaces. Using theorem 2, the projected vectors PTk x and P T k y are separated by an angle equal to the the angle between the i\nth principal vector pair between Sk and \u2211 j 6=k Sj . Let the cosine of this angle be \u03b3. Then, using lemma 4, the added dimensions in the vectors PTk x and P T k y to form the vectors P\nTx and PT y are also separated by some margin \u03b3\u0304 < 1. As the same argument holds for vectors from all classes, the Independent Subspace Structure of the dataset remains preserved after projection.\nFor any two disjoint subspaces, theorem 2 tells us that there is a two dimensional plane in which the entire projected subspaces form two lines. It can be argued that after adding arbitrary valued finite dimensions to the basis of this plane, the two projected subspaces will also remain disjoint (see proof of theorem 3). Theorem 3 simply applies this argument to each subspace and the sum of the remaining subspaces one at a time. Thus for K subspaces, we get 2K projection vectors.\nFinally, our approach projects data to 2K dimensions which could be a concern if the original feature dimension itself is less than 2K. However, since we are only concerned with data that has underlying independent subspace assumption, notice that the feature dimension must be at least K. This is because each class must lie on at least 1 dimension which is linearly independent of others. However, this is too strict an assumption and it is straight forward to see that if we relax this assumption to 2 dimensions for each class, the feature dimensions are already at 2K."}, {"heading": "3.1 Implementation", "text": "A naive approach to finding projection vectors (say for a binary class case) would be to compute the SVD of the matrix XT1 X2, where the columns of X1 and X2 contain vectors from class 1 and class 2 respectively. For large datasets this would not only be computationally expensive but also be incapable of handling noise. Thus, even though theorem 3 guarantees the structure preservation of the dataset X after projection using P as specified, this does not solve the problem of dimensionality reduction. The reason is that given a labeled dataset sampled from a union of independent subspaces, we do not have any information about the basis or even the dimensionality of the underlying subspaces. Under these circumstances, constructing the projection matrix P as specified in theorem 3 itself becomes a problem. To solve this problem, we propose an algorithm that tries to find the underlying principal vector pair between subspaces Sk and \u2211 j 6=k Sj (for k = 1 to K) given the labeled dataset X . The assumption behind this attempt is that samples from each subspace (class) are not heavily corrupted and that the underlying subspaces are independent.\nNotice that we are not specifically interested in a particular principal vector pair between any two subspaces for the computation of the projection matrix. This is because we have assumed independent subspaces and so each principal vector pair is separated by some margin \u03b3 < 1. Hence we need an algorithm that computes any arbitrary principal vector pair, given data from two independent subspaces. These vectors can then be used to form one of the K submatrices in P as specified in theorem 3 . For computing the submatrix Pk, we need to find a principal vector pair between subspaces Sk and \u2211 j 6=k Sj . In terms of dataset X , we estimate the vector pair using data in Xk\nAlgorithm 1 Computation of projection matrix P INPUT: X ,K,\u03bb, itermax\nfor k=1 to K do w\u22172 \u2190 random vector in RN\u0304k while iter < itermax or \u03b3 not converged do w\u22171 \u2190 arg minw1\u2016Xkw1 \u2212 X\u0304kw \u2217 2\n\u2016X\u0304kw\u22172\u20162 \u20162 + \u03bb\u2016w1\u20162\nw\u22171 \u2190 w\u22171/norm(w\u22171) w\u22172 \u2190 arg minw2\u2016 Xkw \u2217 1\n\u2016Xkw\u22171\u20162 \u2212 X\u0304kw2\u20162 + \u03bb\u2016w2\u20162\nw\u22172 \u2190 w\u22172/norm(w\u22172) \u03b3 \u2190 (Xkw\u22171)T (X\u0304kw\u22172)\nend while Pk \u2190 [Xkw\u22171 , X\u0304kw\u22172 ]\nend for P \u2217 \u2190 [P1 . . .

Then fix this vector and search of the closest vector in X\u0304k. Repeating this process till the convergence of the cosine between these 2 vectors leads to a principal vector pair. In order to estimate the closest vector from opposite subspace, we have used a quadratic program in 1 that minimizes the reconstruction error of the fixed vector (of one subspace) using vectors from the opposite subspace. The regularization in the optimization is to handle noise in data."}, {"heading": "3.2 Justification", "text": "The definition 1 for margin \u03b3 between two subspaces S1 and S2 can be equivalently expressed as\n1\u2212 \u03b3 = min w1,w2\n1 2 \u2016B1w1 \u2212B2w2\u20162 s.t. \u2016B1w1\u20162 = 1, \u2016B2w2\u20162 = 1 (5)\nwhere the columns of B1 \u2208 Rn\u00d7d1 and B2 \u2208 Rn\u00d7d2 are the basis of the subspaces S1 and S2 respectively such that BT1 B1 and B T 2 B2 are both identity matrices.\nProposition 5 Let B1 \u2208 Rn\u00d7d1 and B2 \u2208 Rn\u00d7d2 be the basis of two disjoint subspaces S1 and S2. Then for any principal vector pair (ui, vi) between the subspaces S1 and S2, the corresponding vector pair (w1 \u2208 Rd1 ,w2 \u2208 Rd2 ), s.t. ui = B1w1 and vi = B2w2, is a local minima to the objective in equation (5).\nProof: The Lagrangian function for the above objective is:\nL(w1, w2,\u03b7) = 1\n2 wT1 B T 1 B1w1+\n1 2 wT2 B T 2 B2w2\u2212wT1 BT1 B2w2+\u03b71(\u2016B1w1\u20162\u22121)+\u03b72(\u2016B2w2\u20162\u22121)\n(6)\nThen setting the gradient w.r.t. w1 to zero we get\n\u2207w1L = (1 + 2\u03b71)w1 \u2212BT1 B2w2 = 0 (7) Let USV T be the SVD of BT1 B2 and w1 and w2 be the i\nth columns of U and V respectively. Then equation (7) becomes\n\u2207w1L = (1 + 2\u03b71)w1 \u2212 USV Tw2 = (1 + 2\u03b71)w1 \u2212 Siiw1 = 0\n(8)\nThus the gradient w.r.t. w1 is zero when \u03b71 = 12 (Sii\u22121). Similarly, it can be shown that the gradient w.r.t. w2 is zero when \u03b72 = 12 (Sii \u2212 1). Thus the gradient of the Lagrangian L is 0 w.r.t. both w1 and w2 for every corresponding principal vector pair. Thus vector pair (w1, w2) corresponding to any of the principal vector pairs between subspaces S1 and S2 is a local minima to the objective 5.\nSince (w1, w2) corresponding to any principal vector pair between two disjoint subspaces form a local minima to the objective given by equation (5), one can alternatively minimize equation (5) w.r.t. w1 and w2 and reach one of the local minima. Thus, by assuming independent subspace structure for all the K classes in algorithm 1 and setting \u03bb to zero, it is straight forward to see that the algorithm yields a projection matrix that satisfies the criteria specified by theorem 3.\nFinally, real world data do not strictly satisfy the independent subspace assumption in general and even a slight corruption in data may easily lead to the violation of this independence. In order to tackle this problem, we add a regularization (\u03bb > 0) term while solving for the principal vector pair in algorithm 1. If we assume that the corruption is not heavy, reconstructing a sample using vectors belonging to another subspace would require a large coefficient over those vectors. The regularization avoids reconstructing data from one class using vectors from another class that are slightly corrupted by assigning such vectors small coefficients."}, {"heading": "3.3 Complexity", "text": "Solving algorithm 1 requires solving an unconstrained quadratic program within a while-loop.

Resulting from this analysis, we proposed an efficient iterative algorithm (1) that tries to exploit these properties for learning a projection matrix for dimensionality reduction that preserves independence between multiple subspaces. Our empirical results on three real world datasets yield state-of-the-art results compared to popular dimensionality reduction methods."}], "references": [{"title": "Laplacian eigenmaps for dimensionality reduction and data representation", "author": ["Mikhail Belkin", "Partha Niyogi"], "venue": "Neural Comput.,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2003}, {"title": "From few to many: Illumination cone models for face recognition under variable lighting and pose", "author": ["A.S.

However, dimensionality reduction approaches that theoretically preserve this independence assumption have not been well studied. Our key contribution is to show that 2K projection vectors are sufficient for the independence preservation of any K class data sampled from a union of independent subspaces. It is this non-trivial observation that we use for designing our dimensionality reduction technique. In this paper, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction algorithm that theoretically preserves this structure for a given dataset. We support our theoretical analysis with empirical results on both synthetic and real world data achieving state-of-the-art results compared to popular dimensionality reduction techniques.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
