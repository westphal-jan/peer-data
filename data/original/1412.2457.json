(SIAM J. Comput. 2008) shows that halfspaces can be learned with respect to log-concave distributions on Rn in the challenging agnostic learning model. The power of this algorithm relies on the fact that under log-concave distributions, halfspaces can be approximated arbitrarily well by low-degree polynomials. We ask whether this technique can be extended beyond log-concave distributions, and establish a negative result. We show that polynomials of any degree cannot approximate the sign function to within arbitrarily low error for a large class of non-log-concave distributions on the real line, including those with densities proportional to exp(\u2212|x|0.99). This impossibility result extends to multivariate distributions, and thus gives a strong limitation on the power of the polynomial regression algorithm for halfspaces.\nSecondly, we investigate the derandomization of Chernoff-type concentration inequalities. Chernoff-type tail bounds on sums of independent random variables have pervasive applications in theoretical computer science. Schmidt et al. (SIAM J. Discrete Math. 1995) showed that these inequalities can be established for sums of random variables with only O(log(1/\u03b4))-wise independence, for a tail probability of \u03b4. We show that their results are tight up to constant factors.\nThese results rely on techniques from weighted approximation theory, which studies how well functions on the real line can be approximated by polynomials under various distributions.

It has found many applications in computer science. Most of these applications of approximation theory focus on the approximation of functions by polynomials in the uniform norm (or infinity norm). For instance, approximate degree, which captures how well a boolean function can be approximated by low-degree polynomials in the uniform norm, underlies important lower bounds in circuit complexity [Bei93, Bei94, She09], quantum query complexity [BBC+01, AS04], and communication complexity [She08]. It also underlies state-of-the art algorithms in learning theory [KKMS08, KS04], streaming [HNO08], and in spectral methods [SV14].\nWhile it is compelling to study polynomial approximations under the uniform norm, there are scenarios where it is more natural to study weighted polynomial approximations, where error is measured in terms of an Lp norm under some distribution. For instance, in agnostic learning, the polynomial regression algorithm of Kalai et al. [KKMS08] has guarantees based on how well functions in a concept class of interest can be approximated by low-degree polynomials in L1 distance.\nIn this work, we show how ideas from weighted approximation theory can yield tight lower bounds for several problems in theoretical computer science. As our first application, we establish a strong limitation on the distributions under which halfspaces can be learned using the polynomial regression algorithm of Kalai et al. Second, in the area of derandomization, we give a tight characterization of the amount of k-wise independence necessary to establish Chernoff-like concentration inequalities."}, {"heading": "1.1 Agnostically Learning Halfspaces", "text": "Halfspaces are a fundamental concept class in machine learning, both in theory and in practice.1 Their study dates back to the Perceptron algorithm of the 1950s. Halfspaces serve as building blocks in many applications, including boosting and kernel methods.\nHalfspaces can be learned in the PAC model [Val84] either by solving a linear program, or via simple iterative update algorithms (e.g. the Perceptron algorithm). However, learning halfspaces with classification noise is a much more difficult problem, and often needs to be dealt with in practice.\nIn this work, we study a challenging model of adversarial noise \u2013 the agnostic learning model of Kearns et al. [KSSH94]. In this model, a learner has access to examples drawn from a distribution D on X \u00d7 {\u00b11} and must output a hypothesis h : X \u2192 {\u00b11} such that\nP (x,y)\u223cD\n[h(x) 6= y] \u2264 opt + \u03b5,\nwhere opt is the error of the best concept in the concept class \u2013 that is, opt = minf\u2208C P (x,y)\u223cD [f(x) 6= y]. The theory of agnostic learning is not well-understood, even in the case of halfspaces. Positive results for efficient agnostic learning of high-dimensional halfspaces are restricted to limited classes of distributions.2 For instance, halfspaces can be learned under the uniform distribution over the\n1A halfspace is a function f : Rn \u2192 {\u00b11} given by f(x) = sgn(w \u00b7 x\u2212 \u03b8) for w \u2208 Rn and \u03b8 \u2208 R, where sgn(x) = 1 if x \u2265 0 and sgn(x) = \u22121 otherwise.\n2An efficient algorithm is one which runs in time polynomial in the dimension n for any constant \u03b5 > 0 \u2013 that is, time nO\u03b5(1).\nhypercube or the unit sphere, or on any log-concave distribution [KKMS08]. On the negative side, a variety of both computational and information-theoretic hardness results are known. For instance, proper agnostic learning of halfspaces (where the learner is required to output a hypothesis that is itself a halfspace) is known to be NP-hard [FGKP06]. Moreover, agnostically learning halfspaces under arbitrary distributions is as hard as PAC learning DNFs [LBW95], which is a longstanding open problem.\nThere is essentially only one known technique for agnostically learning high-dimensional halfspaces: the L1 regression algorithm [KKMS08], which we discuss in more detail in Section 2.2. In its most general form, the algorithm selects a linear space of functions H \u2282 {h : X \u2192 R}. After drawing a number of examples (xi, yi) from D, it computes\nh\u2217 = argmin h\u2208H\n\u2211\ni\n|h(xi)\u2212 yi|.\nThe output of the algorithm is sgn(h\u2217(x)\u2212 t) for some t. We need to ensure that the minimisation can be computed efficiently (e.g. by linear programming) and that every concept f \u2208 C can be approximated by some h \u2208 H \u2013 that is E\nx\u223cD [|h(x) \u2212 f(x)|] \u2264 \u03b5. If this is the case, then C is\nagnostically learnable in time poly(|H|). Kalai et al. (and most subsequent work on learning using L1 regression, e.g. [KOS08, GKK08, BOW10, KKM13, FK14]) chose H to be the class of low-degree polynomials. They showed that under certain classes of distributions, every halfspace can be approximated by a polynomial of degree O\u03b5(1), and hence halfspaces are agnostically learnable in time n\nO\u03b5(1). Distributional assumptions arise because we use an L1 approximation measure (namely E\nx\u223cD [|h(x) \u2212 f(x)|]),\nwhich depends on the distribution. A distribution-independent approximation would require an L\u221e approximation, which is too much to hope for in many circumstances."}, {"heading": "1.1.1 Our Results", "text": "Can we weaken the distributional assumptions required for learning halfspaces using current techniques? Our result addressing this question (Theorem 2) is a negative one. We show that polynomial approximations to halfspaces do not exist for a large class of distributions, namely:\nDefinition 1. An absolutely continuous distribution D on R is a log-superlinear (LSL) distribution if there exist C > 0 and \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1) such that the density w of D satisfies w(x) \u2265 C exp(\u2212|x|\u03b3).3\nTheorem 2. For any LSL distribution D, there exists \u03b5 > 0 such that no polynomial (of any degree) can approximate the sign function with L1 error less than \u03b5 with respect to D.\nIn particular, this implies that the polynomial regression algorithm is not able to agnostically learn thresholds on the real line to within arbitrarily small error. Note that this result does not rule out the possibility that halfspaces can be agnostically learned by other techniques. Indeed, the classic approach of empirical risk minimization (see [KSSH94] and the references therein) gives an efficient algorithm for learning thresholds (which are halfspaces in one dimension) under arbitrary distributions. Thus the problem of learning real thresholds under LSL distributions is an explicit example for which polynomial regression fails while other techniques can succeed.\n3The name log-superlinear comes from the fact that the tails of the probability density function of a LSL distribution are heavier than that of the log-linear Laplace distribution.\nIf we were to take \u03b3 \u2265 1, the probability density function C(\u03b3)e\u2212|x|\u03b3 (where C(\u03b3) is a normalising constant) would give a log-concave distribution, in which case Kalai et al. [KKMS08] show that good polynomial approximations to halfspaces exist. Thus our result gives a threshold between where polynomial approximations to halfspaces exist and where they do not.\nOur result for thresholds extends readily to an impossibility result for learning halfspaces over Rn:\nTheorem 3. For any product distribution D on Rn with a LSL marginal distribution on some coordinate, there exists \u03b5 > 0 and a halfspace h such that no polynomial can approximate h with L1 error less than \u03b5 with respect to D.\nOur result echoes prior work establishing the limits of uniform polynomial approximations for various concept classes. For instance, the seminal work of Minsky and Papert [MP72] showed that there is an intersection of two halfpsaces over Rn which cannot be represented as the sign of any polynomial. Building on work of Nisan and Szegedy [NS94], Paturi [Pat92] gave tight lower bounds for uniform approximations to symmetric boolean functions. This, and subsequent work on lower bounds for approximate degree, immediately imply limitations for distributionindependent agnostic learning via polynomial regression. Klivans and Sherstov [KS10] also showed a strong generalization of Paturi\u2019s result to disjunctions, giving limitations on how well they can be approximated by linear combinations of arbitrary features. By contrast to all of these results, our work shows a strong limitation for certain distribution-dependent polynomial approximations.\nIn the distribution-dependent setting, Feldman and Kothari [FK14] showed that polynomial regression cannot be used to learn disjunctions with respect to symmetric distributions on the hypercube. Recent work of Daniely et al. [DLS14] also uses ideas from approximation theory to show limitations on broad class of regression and kernel-based methods for learning halfspaces, even under a margin assumption. While our results only apply to polynomial regression, they hold for approximations of arbitrarily high complexity (i.e. degree), and for a large class of natural distributions.\nThe proof of Theorem 2 relies on several Markov-type inequalities for weighted polynomial approximations. These are generalizations of the classical Markov inequality for uniform approximations, which gives a bound on the derivative of a low-degree polynomial that is bounded on the unit interval:\nTheorem 4 ([Mar90]). Let p be a polynomial of degree d with |p(x)| \u2264 1 on the interval [\u22121, 1]. Then |p\u2032(x)| \u2264 d2 on [\u22121, 1].\nEarly work on the approximate degree of boolean functions [NS94, Pat92] used Markov\u2019s inequality to get tight lower bounds on the degree of uniform approximations to symmetric functions. For weighted approximations under LSL distributions, we actually get a much stronger statement. It turns out that under LSL distributions, the derivative of a bounded polynomial near the origin is at most a constant independent of degree. With this powerful fact in hand, the proof of Theorem 2 is quite simple. Consider the threshold function f(t) = sgn(t). Since f has a \u201cjump\u201d at zero, any good polynomial approximation to f must be bounded and have a large derivative near zero. The higher quality the approximation, the larger a derivative we need. But since the derivative of any polynomial is bounded by a constant, we cannot get arbitrarily good approximations to f using polynomials.\nWe give the full proof in Section 2.4, and discuss the multivariate generalization in Section 2.5."}, {"heading": "1.1.2 Related Work", "text": "There is a rich literature on lower bounds for agnostic learning. In the case of proper agnostic learning Feldman et. al [FGKP06] gave an optimal NP-hardness result for even weakly agnostically learn halfspaces over Qn. Guruswami and Raghavendra [GR06] showed that the same is true even for halfspaces on the boolean hypercube.\nThere has also been a line of work giving representation-independent hardness of learning halfspaces based on cryptographic assumptions. Feldman et. al [FGKP06] and Klivans and Sherstov [KS09] showed that, assuming the security of certain public key encryptions schemes, it is hard to even PAC learn thresholds and intersections of halfspaces, respectively. These results imply that it is hard to agnostically learn a single halfspace in the harsh noise regime, i.e. when opt is very close to 12 . Shalev-Schwartz et al. [SSSS11] further showed that halfspaces cannot be efficiently learned even under a large margin assumptions.\nThere has also been extensive work proving unconditional lower bounds for restricted learning algorithms. One well-studied restriction on a learner is that it operates in Kearns\u2019 statistical query (SQ) model [Kea98, BFJ+94, KS07, FLS11]. This model captures L1 regression, as well as essentially every technique known for learning (besides Gaussian elimination). Very recently, Dachman-Soled et al. [DFT+14] showed that polynomial regression is in fact essentially the optimal SQ algorithm for agnostic learning with respect to product distributions on the hypercube.\nThe limitations we prove for polynomial regression do not rule out the existence of other agnostic learning algorithms, including those using L1 regression with different feature spaces. Wimmer [Wim10] showed how to use a different family of basis functions to learn halfspaces over symmetric distributions on the hypercube. Subsequent work of Feldman and Kothari [FK14] improved the running time in the special case of disjunctions. We leave it as an intriguing open question to determine whether other basis functions can be used to learn halfspaces under LSL distributions."}, {"heading": "1.2 Tail Bounds for Limited Independence", "text": "The famous Hoeffding bound [Hoe63] implies that if X \u2208 {\u00b11}n is a uniform random variable and r \u2208 Rn is fixed, then, for all T \u2265 0,\nP X [|X \u00b7 r| \u2265 T ] \u2264 2e\n\u2212 T2 2||r||22 .\nWe ask the following question:\nFor what pseudorandom X is the Hoeffding bound true?\nMore precisely, given T and \u03b4, can we construct a pseudorandom X such that P X [|X \u00b7 r| \u2265 T ] \u2264 \u03b4 for all r \u2208 {\u00b11}n?4 Of particular interest is the parameter regime \u03b4 = 1/poly(n) and T = \u0398(||r||2 \u221a\nlog(1/\u03b4)).

The challenge is to give an explicit construction of such an X which can be efficiently sampled with a short seed.\nThis is a very natural pseudorandomness question: Concentration of measure is a fundamental property of independent random variables and one of the key objectives of pseudorandomness research is to replicate such properties for variables with low entropy. Finding a pseudorandom X\n4For simplicity we restrict our attention to r \u2208 {\u00b11}n.\nexhibiting good concentration is also a relaxation of a more general and well-studied pseudorandomness question, namely constructing pseudorandom generators that fool linear threshold functions [DGJ+09, MZ10, GOWZ10, DSTW10]. This can also be viewed as a special case of constructing pseudorandom generators for space-bounded computation [Nis92, INW94, Rei08, BRRY10, BV10, KNP11, RSV13].\nFor \u03b4 = 1/poly(n) and T = \u0398( \u221a\nn log(1/\u03b4)), we can construct generators X with seed length O(log2 n) using a variety of methods (including [Nis92, MZ10]). In particular, it suffices for X to be O(log(1/\u03b4))-wise independent:\nTheorem 5 (Tail Bound for Limited Independence). Let n \u2265 1, \u03b7 > 0, and \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1) be given. Let X \u2208 {\u00b11}n be k-wise independent for k = 2\u2308\u03b7 loge(1/\u03b4)\u2309. Set T = e(\u03b7+1)/2\u03b7 \u221a k ||r||2.

Another construction which achieves seed length O(log n \u00b7 log(1/\u03b4)) is to sample X from a small-bias space [NN93]. Very recently, Gopalan et al. [GKM14] constructed a new generator with seed length O\u0303(log(n/\u03b4)), which is nearly optimal.\nIn this work, we ask whether the tail bound of Theorem 5 for k-wise independence is tight. That is, can we prove stronger tail bounds for k-wise independent X?\nQuestion 6. How much independence is needed for X to satisfy a Hoeffding-like tail bound? That is, what is the minimum k = k(n, \u03b4, T ) for which any k-wise independent X \u2208 {\u00b11}n satisfies\nP X [|X \u00b7 r| \u2265 T ] \u2264 \u03b4\nfor all r \u2208 {\u22121, 1}n, where \u00b7 denotes the inner product."}, {"heading": "1.2.1 Our Results", "text": "Theorem 5 shows that k(n, \u03b4, T ) \u2264 O(log(1/\u03b4)) for T = O( \u221a\nn log(1/\u03b4)). In this work, we show that this is essentially tight:\nTheorem 7. For T = c \u221a\nn log(1/\u03b4) (c > 5), we have k(n, \u03b4, T ) = \u2126(logc(1/\u03b4)) for sufficiently large n.\nThe only previous lower bound was\nk(n, \u03b4, T )) \u2265 \u2126 ( log(1/\u03b4)\nlog n\n)\n,\nwhich holds for any T \u2264 n and is due to [SSS95]. This is useful if \u03b4 < n\u2212\u03c9(1), but the lower bound is constant in our parameter regime. This lower bound follows from the fact that a random variable X with support size s cannot give a tail bound with \u03b4 < 1/s, and that there exist k-wise independent distributions with support size s \u2264 O(nk).\nThe most natural way to prove Theorem 7 would be to construct a family of k-wise independent distributions that do not satisfy the required tail bound. However, we instead study the dual formulation of the problem (following [Baz09, DETT10]) and then use lower bound techniques\nfrom approximation theory. To the best of our knowledge, this indirect approach is novel. Our results imply the existence of k-wise independent distributions with poor tail bounds, but give no immediate indication as to how to construct them!\nWe now describe the proof idea in slightly more detail. The answer to Question 6 can be posed in terms of the value of a certain linear program. The variables represent the probability distribution of the random variable X and the constraints force X to be k-wise independent. The objective of the linear program is maximize P [|X \u00b7 r| \u2265 T ]. Thus, the value of the program is at most \u03b4 if and only if k \u2265 k(n, \u03b4, T ). Taking the dual of this linear program and appealing to strong duality yields an alternative characterization of k(n, \u03b4, T ). Namely, k(n, \u03b4, T ) is the smallest k for which the threshold function FT (x) = 1(|x| \u2265 T ) admits an upper sandwiching polynomial of degree k and expectation at most \u03b4. Here, an upper sandwiching polynomial is simply a polynomial p for which p(x) \u2265 FT (x) pointwise.\nWe then use ideas from weighted approximation theory to give a lower bound on k for which such sandwiching polynomials exist. In order to apply these ideas, we make a few symmetrization and approximation arguments to reduce the problem to a continuous one-dimensional problem: Find a degree lower bound for a univariate polynomial that is a good upper sandwich for the function fT (x) = sgn(|x|\u2212T ), with respect to a Gaussian distribution. As in our proof of Theorem 2, the solution of this problem appeals to a weighted Markov-type inequality. Again, the idea is that an upper sandwich for fT must have a large jump at the threshold T , which is impossible for low-degree polynomials. The formal proof of this claim is based on a variant of an \u201cinfinite-finite range\u201d inequality, which asserts that the weighted norm of a polynomial on the real line is bounded by its norm on a finite interval."}, {"heading": "2 Agnostically Learning Halfspaces", "text": "The class of log-concave distributions over Rn (defined below) is essentially the broadest under which we know how to agnostically learn halfspaces.

For instance, the log-normal distribution and heavier-tailed exponential power law distributions are not log-concave. The main motivating question for this section is whether we can relax the assumption of log-concavity for agnostically learning halfspaces.

The concept class of halfspaces over Rn is agnostically learnable in time poly(nO\u03b5(1)) under log-concave distributions.\nA log-concave distribution is an absolutely continuous probability distribution such that the logarithm of the probability density function is concave. For example, the standard multivariate Gaussian distribution on Rn has the probability density function x 7\u2192 e\u2212||x||22/2/(2\u03c0)n/2.

It is important to note that making assumptions on the distribution is necessary (barring a major breakthrough): Agnostically learning halfspaces under arbitrary distributions is at least as hard as PAC learning DNF formulas [LBW95]. Moreover, proper learning of halfspaces under arbitrary distributions is known to be NP-hard [FGKP06].\nIn fact, we can reduce the task of approximating a halfspace to a one-dimensional problem.

It turns out that under a LSL distribution w, polynomials actually fail to be dense in the space C0[w] of continuous functions vanishing at infinity when weighted by w. This is in stark contrast to the classical Weierstrass approximation theorem, which asserts that the polynomials are dense in C0 under the uniform weight. These kinds of results address Bernstein\u2019s approximation problem [Ber24], a precise statement of which is as follows.\n5Here X = Rn.\nQuestion 10. Let w : R \u2192 [0, 1] be a measurable function. Let C0[w] denote the space of continuous functions f for which lim|x|\u2192\u221e f(x)w(x) = 0.

If Bernstein\u2019s problem admits a positive resolution, we say that the polynomials are dense in C0[w]. The excellent survey of Lubinsky [Lub07] presents a number of criteria for when polynomials are dense. The one that is most readily applied was proved by Carleson [Car51] (but appears to be implicit in [IK37]):\nTheorem 11. Let w be even and positive with log(w(ex)) concave. Then the polynomials are dense in C0[w] iff\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nlogw(x)\n1 + x2 dx = \u2212\u221e.\nThis immediately yields the following dichotomy result for exponential power distributions:\nCorollary 12.

Recall that the analysis of the L1-regression algorithm of Kalai et al. [KKMS08] reduces approximating a halfspace under a distribution D to the problem of approximating each threshold function sgn(x \u2212 \u03b8) under each marginal distribution of D. So for the algorithm to work, we require D to have marginals w under which sgn(x \u2212 \u03b8) can be approximated arbitrarily well by polynomials. Now if the polynomials are dense in C0[w], then threshold functions can also be approximated arbitrarily well (since C0[w] is in turn dense in L1[w]). Such an appeal to density actually underlies Kalai et al.\u2019s proof of approximability under log-concave distributions. On the other hand, if the polynomials fail to be dense, then one might conjecture that thresholds cannot be arbitrarily well approximated.\nOur result, presented in the next section, confirms the conjecture that even the sign function cannot be approximated arbitrarily well by polynomials under LSL distributions."}, {"heading": "2.4 Lower Bound for One Variable", "text": "Consider the LSL density function\nw\u03b3(x) := C(\u03b3) exp(\u2212|x|\u03b3)\non the reals for \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1), where C(\u03b3) is a normalizing constant.

For any i \u2208 [n], we have\nE [ etriXi ] = 1\n2\n( etri + e\u2212tri ) = \u221e \u2211\nk=0\n(tri) k + (\u2212tri)k 2k!\n= \u221e \u2211\nk=0\n(tri) 2k\n(2k)! \u2264\n\u221e \u2211\nk=0\n(t2r2i ) k\n2kk! = et 2r2i /2.\nBy independence,\nE\n[ et(X\u00b7r) ] = n \u220f\ni=1\nE [ etriXi ] \u2264 n \u220f\ni=1\net 2r2i /2 = et 2||r||22/2.\nNow we have\nE\n[ et(X\u00b7r) ] =\n\u221e \u2211\nk=0\ntk k! E [ (X \u00b7 r)k ] \u2264 et2||r||22/2.\nWe wish to bound a single moment, namely E [ (X \u00b7 r)k\u2217 ]\nfor an even k\u2217. We do this by picking\none term out of the above infinite sum. We have E [ (X \u00b7 r)k ] \u2265 0 for even k, so these terms can be removed from the sum without increasing it. By changing the sign of t, we can ensure that the sum of the odd terms is positive and thus\ntk\u2217 k\u2217! E [ (X \u00b7 r)k\u2217 ]\n\u2264 \u221e \u2211\nk=0\ntk k! E [ (X \u00b7 r)k ] = E [ et(X\u00b7r) ] \u2264 et2||r||22/2.\nRearranging and setting t = \u00b1 \u221a k\u2217/ ||r||2, we obtain\nE\n[ (X \u00b7 r)k\u2217 ] \u2264 k\u2217! tk\u2217 et 2||r||22/2 = k\u2217! ||r||k\u22172 ek\u2217/2\u221a k\u2217 k\u2217 \u2264 ( k2\u2217 ||r||22 e k\u2217 )k\u2217/2 = (e ||r||22 k\u2217)k\u2217/2,\nas required.\nNow we can prove the upper bound for k-wise independence using the connection between moment bounds and tail bounds [SSS95].\nProof of Theorem 5. Note that, if X \u2208 {\u00b11}n is k-wise independent, then\nE\n[ (X \u00b7 r)k ] = \u2211\ni1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7ik\u2208[n]\n\n\nk \u220f\nj=1\nrij\n\n \u00b7 E\n\n\nk \u220f\nj=1\nXij\n\n\nis the same as for uniform X, as this is the expectation of a degree-k polynomial. By Lemma 24 and Markov\u2019s inequality, we have (assuming k is even),\nP [|X \u00b7 r| \u2265 T ] = P [ (X \u00b7 r)k \u2265 T k ] \u2264 E [ (X \u00b7 r)k ]\nT k \u2264\n(\ne ||r||22 k T 2\n)k/2\n.\nSubstituting k = 2\u2308\u03b7 loge(1/\u03b4)\u2309 and T = e(\u03b7+1)/2\u03b7 \u221a k ||r||2, we have\nP [|X \u00b7 r| \u2265 T ] \u2264 ( e ||r||22 k (e(\u03b7+1)/2\u03b7 \u221a k ||r||2)2\n)\u2308\u03b7 loge(1/\u03b4)\u2309\n= e\u2212\u2308\u03b7 loge(1/\u03b4)\u2309/\u03b7 \u2264 \u03b4."}], "references": [{"title": "A fast and simple randomized parallel algorithm for the maximal independent set problem", "author": ["Noga Alon", "Laszlo Babai", "Alon Itai"], "venue": "Technical report,", "citeRegEx": "Alon et al\\.,? \\Q1985\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Alon et al\\.", "year": 1985}, {"title": "Quantum lower bounds for the collision and the element distinctness problems", "author": ["Scott Aaronson", "Yaoyun Shi"], "venue": "J.

In particular, polynomial approximations to the sign function underly algorithms for agnostically learning halfspaces, as well as pseudorandom generators for halfspaces. In this work, we investigate the limits of these techniques by proving inapproximability results for the sign function. Firstly, the \u201cpolynomial regression\u201d algorithm of Kalai et al. (SIAM J. Comput. 2008) shows that halfspaces can be learned with respect to log-concave distributions on Rn in the challenging agnostic learning model. The power of this algorithm relies on the fact that under log-concave distributions, halfspaces can be approximated arbitrarily well by low-degree polynomials. We ask whether this technique can be extended beyond log-concave distributions, and establish a negative result. We show that polynomials of any degree cannot approximate the sign function to within arbitrarily low error for a large class of non-log-concave distributions on the real line, including those with densities proportional to exp(\u2212|x|0.99). This impossibility result extends to multivariate distributions, and thus gives a strong limitation on the power of the polynomial regression algorithm for halfspaces. Secondly, we investigate the derandomization of Chernoff-type concentration inequalities. Chernoff-type tail bounds on sums of independent random variables have pervasive applications in theoretical computer science. Schmidt et al. (SIAM J. Discrete Math. 1995) showed that these inequalities can be established for sums of random variables with only O(log(1/\u03b4))-wise independence, for a tail probability of \u03b4. We show that their results are tight up to constant factors. These results rely on techniques from weighted approximation theory, which studies how well functions on the real line can be approximated by polynomials under various distributions. We believe that these techniques will have further applications in other areas of theoretical computer science. Harvard University, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
