While the main focus of this line of work has been to construct a shared representation that best combines multiple modalities, most of the work assume the existence of the parallel multimodal dataset where the shared multimodal representation can be learned.\nIn reality, however, acquiring a parallel multimodal dataset is extremely resource consuming, and thus there is often an imbalance in the amount of the labeled data among different modalities. For example, while the labeled audio speech data is readily abundant, the labeled data for lip reading videos is much more scarce, consequently making the unparallel portion of the audio data obsolete for multimodal learning. In this paper, we address the data imbalance among different modalities via a transfer learning approach.\nThe transfer learning relaxes the imbalance of the available data in source tasks and target tasks via selective instance selections or feature transformation ([3, 4]). However, while transfer learning works well when source tasks and target tasks are moderately in the same domain, direct knowledge transfer between different modalities is often intractable often due to their drastically different statistical properties in concept space ([5]). In this regard, several approaches such as DCCA ([6]), DeViSE ([7]), HHTL ([8]), and DCCAE ([9]) have proposed to utilize deep neural networks to obtain abstract representation of data (e.g. at the top-most layer of the network), thus allowing for more viable knowledge transfer. Most of these approaches aim at learning a single robust mapping\nar X\niv :1\n41 2.\n31 21\nv2 [\ncs .N\nE ]\n1 8\nFe b\nbetween the two modalities, and then use the newly learned embeddings to learn a new model for a shared task or a target task.\nIn this paper, we propose a new approach that can benefit the target task in the case of sourcetarget data imbalance scenario. Specifically, we learn the semantic mappings between intermediate layers of each neural network, and leverage learned embeddings to fine-tune the target network. Our approach has several practical benefits in that we keep the topology of the target network unchanged, thus not requiring to build a separate model with a shared representation, etc. Instead, we directly modify the target network by tuning its hyper-parameters, and thus the same network can be used for the target task.\nAs an application of our framework, we choose to study the transfer between speech and lip-reading video data. However, our framework is unobtrusive and flexible, and thus can be used for transfer between any modalities with any two already-built deep networks, given the small initial parallel modality corpora that correspond to the same semantics."}, {"heading": "2 Problem Formulation", "text": "We formulate the proposed framework with application in the audio and video lip-reading multimodal learning settings. Figure 1 illustrates the following formulation. We initially have two input data of different modalities: XA = {X1A, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , XNA } and XV = {X1V , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , XNV }, which correspond to the parallel audio and video data, respectively. Both XA and XV map to the same ground-truth categorical labels Z = {Z1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ZN}. Each input audio instance XnA and video instance XnV lies in different concept spaces, thus XnA \u2208 Rp and XnV \u2208 Rq . Two separate neural nets, NA and NV , can be built from XA and XV , respectively. We denote NA : XA \u2192 Y and NV : XV \u2192 Y where Y is a predicted label as a final output of the neural networks, given some XA \u2208 XA or XV \u2208 XV .\nAdditionally, we also denote N (i)A : XA \u2192 H (i) A and N (i) V : XV \u2192 H (i) V , where H (i) A \u2208 Rpi and H (i) V \u2208 Rqi are the output of the i-th layer of the two neural nets, respectively, \u2200i \u2208 {0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , l+1}. Note that H(0) = X , H(l+1) = Y , and H(i+1) := g(H(i),W(i\u2192i+1)), where W(i\u2192i+1) is the weight between H(i) and H(i+1) for i \u2208 {0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , l}. HA and HV thus represent the input XA and XV at different abstraction levels.\nWe then define a new set of labeled audio data, (X\u2217A = {X\u2217A 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , X\u2217A M},Z\u2217 = {Z\u22171, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Z\u2217M}), which is unparallel and unforeseen in the video dataset in label space (X\u2217V is assumed to be not available at training phase). Our purpose is then to learn a transfer function T (i)A\u2192V : H (i) A \u2192 H (i) V \u2200i \u2208 {0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,m} using XA and XV , from which we can fine-tune NV with TA\u2192V (H\u2217A), where H\u2217A = NA(X\u2217A) for X\u2217A \u2208 X\u2217A (Section 3)."}, {"heading": "3 Method", "text": "We obtain abstract representations of the raw data using a standard deep belief network (DBN) with multiple RBM layers. [10] Output values at each intermediate layer of a DBN thus give abstract feature representation of the input data, allowing for a more tractable knowledge transfer between modalities. In our experiment, we build two DBNs (NA andNV ) for audio and video data that have the same number of intermediate layers, and we learn inter-modal embeddings for each layer at the same depth as detailed in Section 3.1. Using the learned mapping between the source and target modalities, we fine-tune the network with the transferred data as detailed in Section 3.2."}, {"heading": "3.1 Learning the Embeddings", "text": "We learn the embedding function TA\u2192V which maps two concept spaces H(i)A \u2208 Rpi and H (i) V \u2208 Rqi . While any embedding method can be applied, we consider the following three embedding methods from literature.\nMultivariate Support Vector Regression (SVR) Using Nonlinear Kernels: we formulate the mapping between two concept spaces as a multivariate regression problem. Specifically, we use Support Vector Regression (SVR) methods with nonlinear kernels ([11]), which can effectively learn the conditional expectation of the target space given the source space. For practical use, we kernelize the weights and add a soft-margin loss function for more flexible and high-dimensional mapping.\nKNN-based Non-parametric Mapping: we can also obtain mappings of new audio input by first finding the K-closest audio samples in the training set, and then returning the average of the values of the corresponding video samples.\nNormalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (NCCA): given a set of N audio and video pairs HA \u2208 RN\u00d7p \u2032 and HV \u2208 RN\u00d7q \u2032 , NCCA obtains U \u2208 Rp\u2032\u00d7c and V \u2208 Rq\u2032\u00d7c which project audio and video into a common c-dimensional latent space by HAU and HV V ([12]). The objective can thus be formulated as:\nmax U,V\ntr(UTHTAHV V) (1)\ns.t. UTHTAHAU=I,V THTVHV V=I.\nwhich we can solve as a generalized eigenvalue problem.\nOnce U and V are obtained, we can formulate the mapping function as TA\u2192V (HA) = HAUVT to obtain the estimated transfer HV ."}, {"heading": "3.2 Fine-tuning with the Transferred Data", "text": "We propose an algorithm to fine-tune the network with the transferred data (TDLFT) as described in Algorithm 1. TDLFT(i) obtains a transfer of the new audio input at i-th layer, H\n(i) V := T (i) A\u2192V (N (i) A (X \u2217 A)), treats it as an input to NV at i-th layer, and computes H (j+1) V :=\ng(H (j) V ,W (j\u2192j+1) V ) for j \u2208 {i, i+1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , l}, where g is an activation function. Finally, we fine-tune W(j\u2192j+1)V for j \u2208 {i, i+ 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , l} via a standard backpropagation algorithm.\nNote that TDLFT(i) does not fine-tuneW(j\u2192j+1)V for j \u2208 {0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , i \u2212 1}. Therefore, only the top (l\u2212 i+1) layers are fine-tuned to the new stimuli, which could be a drawback of this algorithm. However, we argue that this issue can be naturally mitigated through some good choice of i, at which a typical error backpropagation technique reaches the inevitable vanishing errors at bottom layers [13]. Assuming a perfect transfer function learned at this choice of i, we almost have the same effect as if we had a parallel video data X\u2217V available for training.\nIt is interesting to note the expected trade-off behavior for different choices of i. When i is big (i ' l), we expect that the accuracy of transfer is more reliable (e.g. intuitively, T (l+1)A\u2192V should always be correct, because it is a mapping from and to the same label space), however we only get to fine-tune the top (l \u2212 i + 1) layer(s), leaving the rest of the bottom layers un-tuned. A smaller choice of i mitigates this issue, however we typically suffer from an unreliable transfer for i ' 0 (e.g. T (0)A\u2192V is almost intractable, given drastically different concept spaces of the two input types).\nAlgorithm 1 Transfer Deep Learning Fine-Tuning (TDLFT)\nDataset Division Labels # Attribtues # Instances\nAV-Letters\nXA 1-20 624 600 X\u2217A 21-26 180\nXV 1-20 57,600 600 X\u2217V 21-26 180\nStanford\nXA 1-44 1,573 2,064 X\u2217A 45-49 504\nXV 1-44 19,481 2,064 X\u2217V 45-49 504"}, {"heading": "4 Empirical Evaluation", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.1 Dataset", "text": "We use two widely used audio-visual multimodal datasets for empirical evaluation, AV-Letters and Stanford. The AV-Letters dataset ([14]) consists of both audio and lip-reading video data of 10 speakers saying the letters A to Z (thus 26 labels), three times each. The dataset contains pre-extracted lip regions at 60 \u00d7 80 pixels. We represent each audio example as one feature vector by concatenating 24 contiguous audio frames, each with 26 mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC). Similarly, for each video example, we concatenate 12 contiguous video frames, each with 60\u00d780 pixels. The Stanford dataset ([1]) consists of both audio and lip-reading video data of 23 speakers saying the digits 0 to 9, letters A to Z, and some selected sentences (total 49 labels).\nWe divide each dataset by its label space to simulate the data imbalance scenario. For instance, in the AV-Letters dataset, we assume that only the data with labels from 1 to 20 (denoted XV ) are available as a parallel corpus during training of video data, and the video data with labels ranging from 21 to 26 (denoted X\u2217V ) are assumed to be completely unforeseen during the training phase. On the other hand, we assume that the audio data has access to the entire label space (labels 1 to 26) during training (XA \u222aX\u2217A). This is analogous to many real-world situations where the training data for multi-modal learning is imbalanced for one of the modalities, thus the test data of the target modality is radically different from the training data. Table 1 summarizes the datasets configuration."}, {"heading": "4.2 Task", "text": "To evaluate how the transferred knowledge from the source modality improves classification performance of the target modality, we perform comparison studies on the following task with the AV-Letters and Stanford dataset (in Section 4.1). The task is to build a classifier that categorizes each lip-reading video into a label (1-26 for AV-Letters, and 1-49 for Stanford). We assume that only XV and XA are available as a parallel corpus during initial training.\nAssuming that the audio data has extra labeled data (X\u2217A) unparallel in the video training set, we fine-tune the video model (NV ) with the extra transferred audio data as described in Section 3.2. The classification task is performed in a cross validation way on the data spanning the entire labels (XV \u222aX\u2217V ). We then compare the result of our transfer deep learning approach (TDL) against the unimodal baseline where the model is trained only with the available video data (XV )."}, {"heading": "4.3 Results", "text": "In this section, we provide comprehensive empirical results on the task described in Section 4.2 with different combinations of embedding transfer methods and fine-tuning methods (in Section 3).\nTables 2 and 3 shows the comparison of 5-fold cross validation performance between the unimodal (video) model and the transfer deep learning model (TDL) where the network is additionally fine-tuned with the transferred audio data. KNN, NCCA, and SVR refer to the embedding methods that were applied to transfer the audio representations, as detailed in Section 3.1. TDLFT(i) refers to the fine-tuning method applied starting at the i-th layer of the network (Section 3.2). The Oracle baseline shows the semi-oracle bound of TDL which can be achieved if the perfect knowledge transfer \u02c6TA\u2192V is obtainable. The underlined portion on the train sets denote the data that was used to further fine-tune the network via TDLFT. Bold denotes significant improvement of TDL over the baseline. The chance performance for AV-Letters and Stanford is 3.85% (=1/26) and 2.04% (=1/49), respectively.\nTDL with TDLFT(3) outperforms unimodal for both datasets when audio data (source domain) was transferred with any of the proposed embedding methods, showing that the transferred modality enhances the performance of the target modality classification. This is promising because it indicates that we can improve the classification performance in the previously unknown classes of the target task without training samples for those classes. Specifically, our results show that the KNN-based transfer method (KNN) generally yields the best embeddings, followed by NCCA and SVR.\nNote that the TDL performance at TDLFT(0) (where the transfer between modalities was at the raw feature representation level) does not show a significant improvement over the Unimodal baseline. This is because learning embeddings at the input level between the target and the source modalities is often intractable, leading to a poor transfer performance. The network is then fine-tuned with noised transferred data, thus negatively affecting the classification performance. Note that this approach is similar to the traditional feature-transformation-based transfer learning methods.\nAll of the TDL performances are upper-bounded by the Oracle performance which simulates a perfect transfer between modalities. This result indicates that we can improve the transfer deep learning performance with a better transfer embedding method between modalities. Note also that the Oracle performance with TDLFT(0) has the best overall performance. While the transfer of embeddings at the raw input level is intractable in reality, TDLFT(0) fully fine-tunes every layer in the network, which would thus improve the performance the most if embeddings are reliable."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "We proposed a framework for performing transfer learning on neural networks (TDL) under multimodal learning settings. We proposed several embedding methods for transferring knowledge between the target and source modalities, and presented our results on two audio-visual datasets. Our results show that the transferred modality of an abstract representation obtained from intermediate layers of the source network can be effectively utilized to further fine-tune the target network. Specifically, our results indicate that our approach is especially applicable when the data in the target modality is much more scarce (i.e. in label space) than in the source modality.\nFuture Work: we note that the proposed framework can be extended to the idea of reconstructing the modality given the transferred modality via top-down inference [15]. This has many potential applications, for instance in automatically generating lip-motion videos given any audio input using the transferred audio input, which is an improvement over the conventional lip-motion generator that is heavily rule-based or human-engineered. We plan on addressing this problem in the future work."}], "references": [{"title": "Multimodal deep learning", "author": ["J. Ngiam", "A. Khosla", "M. Kim", "J. Nam", "H. Lee", "A.Y.
