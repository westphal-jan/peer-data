This representation is defined by degree of truth T, degree of falsity F and degree of neutrality I. This paper will redefine for the neutrosophic information the features presented above like truth, falsity, ignorance, over-definedness, underdefinedness, net truth, definedness, entropy and it introduces new features like neutrality, saturation and neutrosophic index.

The proposed representations verify the condition of fuzzy partition and are accompanied by operators like negation, union and intersection. It was extended the concepts of certainty like truth and falsity, the concepts of uncertainty like ignorance, ambiguity, overdefinedness, under-definedness, entropy. In addition, it was defined new concepts related to the particularity of neutrosophy like saturation, neutrality and neutrosophic score. The particularization of the obtained formulae for neutrosophic information leads to some formulae that already exist in the specialty literature and are related to intuitionistic fuzzy information and fuzzy one. This fact proves the effectiveness of our approach.\nReferences\n1. Atanassov K.: Intuitionistic Fuzzy sets. Fuzzy Sets and Systems 20, 87-96, (1986) 2.
