When a property P is imprecise, its negation P is considered to be imprecise. The fuzzy set theory assumes both P and P are related, namely: )(1)( xPxP  . However,\nthis is not always true in real life. Hence, sometimes P and P are represented independently. On the other hand, fuzzy sets do not allow to take into account the presence of objects whose membership degree P is undefined. Three valued logics can solve the problem allowing three logical values: true, false and undefined. However, this is not always sufficient and we can find contradictions when a certain value x verifies P and P at the same time. Four-valued logics can solve the problem because it uses four logical values: true, false, undefined and contradictory. There is a\nnegation P are close to 0.5 for some values of x . In this situation, we can detail the knowledge representation using a penta-valued logic based on five logical values: true, false, undefined, contradictory and indeterminate.
