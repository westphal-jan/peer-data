Introduction", "text": "The language model (LM) is an important module in automatic speech recognition (ASR). The most well-known language modelling approach is based upon word n-grams, which relies on statistics of n-gram counts to predict the probability of a word given its past n-1 words. In spite of the wide usage, the n-gram LM possesses an obvious limitation in estimating probabilities of words that are with low frequencies and the words that are absent in the training data. For low-frequency words, the probabilities tend to be under-estimated due to the lack of occurrences of their n-grams in the training data; for words that are absent in training, estimating the probabilities is simply impossible. Ironically, these words are often important entity names that should be emphasized in decoding, which means the probability under-estimation for them is a serious problem for ASR systems in practical usage.\nA well-known approach to dealing with low-frequency and absent words is various smoothing techniques such as backoff [1] and discount [2, 3]. This approach allocates a small proportion of probability mass to low-frequency and absent words so that they are allowed to be recognized. However, the allocated probabilities for these words are very small, which makes it unlikely to be well recognized unless the acoustic evidence is fairly strong. Besides, this approach does not support flexible enhancement for words that are important for a particular domain or application.\nAnother famous approach is to train an LM with some structures that can be dynamically changed, e.g., the class-based LM with classes that are adaptable online [4]. These dynamic structures, however, need to be pre-defined and can not handle words that are not in the structure. For example, words that are not in the pre-defined classes cannot be handled by class-based LMs. Additionally, involving such dynamic structures often requires to modify the decoder, which is not ideal to our opinion.\nRecently, we proposed a similar-pair approach to deal with the problem [5]. The basic idea is to borrow some information from high-frequency words to enhance low-frequency words. More specifically, we seek for a high-frequency word that is similar to the word to enhance, and then re-weight the probability of the low-frequency word by adding a proportion of the probability of the high-frequency words to the the probability\nof the low-frequency words. This approach has been implement with the LM FST graph [6]. Compared to the traditional classbased LM approach, the new approach is flexible to enhance any words and does not need to change the decoder. It has been shown that this approach can provide significant performance gains for low-frequency words and words that are totally absent in the training data.\nThis paper is a following work of [5]. We first present an extension that allows multiple high-frequency words (\u2018indicating words\u2019) to be used when enhancing a low-frequency word. This extension helps to involve multi-source information in the word enhancement, and is particular important for words with multiple senses. Secondly, the similar-pair approach is applied to deal with a particular low-frequency words: out-of-language (OOL) words that are from another language but embedded in utterances of the host language, for example English words appearing in Chinese utterances. These words are totally new for the host language and no context information can be employed to estimate the probabilities for them. The similar-pair approach can deal with the situation, by assuming that words in different languages share the same semantic space and hence similar pairs can essentially cross languages. The experimental results in Section 5 demonstrated the capability of this approach in dealing with OOL words.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses relevant works, and the similar-pair method is described in section 3. The two new extensions are presented in Section 4, which is followed by Section 5 where the experiments are presented. Finally, the entire paper is concluded by Section 6."}, {"heading": "2. Related works", "text": "This work is related to dynamic language modeling that adds new words and re-weighting word probabilities, particulary the approaches that are based on FSTs. This section reviews some typical techniques of this approach, and primarily focuses on the class-based LM that deals with dynamic vocabularies and low-frequency words.\nThe class-based language modeling [7] is an approach that clusters similar words into classes and the probabilities of words in each class are re-distributed, for instance according to their unigram statistics. Typically, the class-based LM delivers better representations than the word-based LM for low-frequency words [4], since the class-based structure factorizes probabilities of low-frequency words into class probabilities and class member probabilities, and so increases robustness of the probability estimation. Moreover, new words can be easily added into classes with the class-based LM, leading to a dynamic vocabulary. Additionally, [8] and [9] introduced two techniques to build both the class-based LMs and the class words into FST graphs and embed class FSTs into the class-based LM FST. This embedding can be done on-the-fly, thus offers a flexible dynamic decoding that supports instant introduction of new words. Similar approaches have been proposed in [10, 11, 12], where various dynamic embedding methods are introduced, and the classes are extended to complex grammars.\nThe work is an extension of the similar-pair method pro-\nar X\niv :1\n50 6.\n04 94\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n6 Ju\nn 20\n15\nposed in [5]. In this approach, the probabilities of lowfrequency words are enhanced and new words are supported by adding new FST transitions, both referring to the transitions of the similar and high-frequency words. Compared to the other approaches mentioned above, this method is more flexible, which supports any words instead of words limited in some pre-defined classes.\nThe extensions we made in this paper for the work in [5] are two-fold: firstly, the similar-pair algorithm is extended to allow multiple predicting words, which enables multiple information engaged and thus better enhancement; second, the similar-pair approach is employed to deal with OOL words, which demonstrated that similar pairs can be cross-lingual."}, {"heading": "3. Word enhancement by similar-pairs", "text": "In this section we first give a brief introduction to the FST-based ASR architecture, and then present the similar pair method implemented on FSTs."}, {"heading": "3.1. Finite state transducer", "text": "A Finite State Transducer (FST) essentially is a Finite State Automaton (FSA) which produces output as well as reading input. It is represented as a graph where every node indicates a state and every arc that links two nodes is assigned an input and an output symbol. Each transition and each terminated state is labeled with a weight. An FST example is depicted in Fig 1. In this example, the initial state is state 0, and the final state is state 2. A weight 3.5 has been assigned to the final state. Let (s, t, i : o/w) denotes a transition, where s and t are the entry and exiting states respectively, and i is the input symbol and o is the output symbol, and w is the associated transition weight. From the initial state 0 to state 1, there are two transitions (0,1,a:x/0.5) and (0,1,b:y/1.5). From the state 1 to the final state 2, there is only one transition (1,2,c:z/2.5). An FST can accept a sequence of input symbols and generate a sequence of corresponding output symbols. For instance in Fig. 1, given an input string \u2018ac\u2019, the transition (0,1,a:x/0.5) accepts the first character \u2018a\u2019 and generates an output \u2018x\u2019 with weight 0.5, and the transition (1,2,c:z/2.5) accepts the second character \u2018c\u2019 and generates an output \u2018z\u2019 with weight 2.5. The weight of the transition path is computed as the sum of the weights associated to each transition in the path, plus the weight associated with the finally state. In our example, the weight of the transition path that accepts \u2018ac\u2019 is 6.5."}, {"heading": "3.2. FST-based speech recognition", "text": "Most of current large-vocabulary speech recognition systems are based on statistical models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), lexicons, decision trees and n-gram LMs. All these models can be converted into the FST models. For an FST, the correlation between the input and output symbols will represent the mapping from a low-level sequence (e.g., phones) to a high-level sequence (e.g., words), and the weights will encode the probability distribution of the mapping. More importantly, FSTs that represent different levels of statistical models can be composed together to form a unified mapping function that associates primary inputs to high-level outputs. The composed FST can be further optimized by standard FST operations, including determinization, minimization and weight pushing. This produces very compact and efficient graphs that represent the knowledge of all the statistical models involved in the composition. In speech recognition, the composition can be used to produce a very efficient graph that maps HMM states to\nword sequences. The graph building process can be represented as follows:\nHCLG = min(det(H \u25e6 C \u25e6 L \u25e6G)) (1)\nwhere H, C, L and G represent the HMM, the decision tree, the lexicon and the LM (or grammar in grammar-based recognition) respectively, and \u25e6, \u2018det\u2019 and \u2018min\u2019 denote the FST operations of composition, determinization and minimization respectively."}, {"heading": "3.3. Low-frequency word enhancement with similar pairs", "text": "The similar pairs method is based on the FST architecture. In order to enhance low-frequency words, and for conducting the enhancement on the LM FST, or the G graph, a list of manually defined similar pairs are provided with corresponding frequency information obtained from training data. The low-frequency words are selected to be enhanced and the high-frequency words are chosen to provide the enhancement information. Each similar pair in the list includes one high-frequency word and some low-frequency words. Given a set of similar words, the lowfrequency words are enhanced by looking at the information of the high-frequency word, including its transitions in the G graph and the associated weights. The high-frequency words are preserved since they have been well represented by the ngram model already."}, {"heading": "4. The Method", "text": "The extension of similar pairs method are introduced in this section. Based upon the similar pairs method, the probability of low-frequency or new words are enhanced by looking at the information of high frequency words. Given a set of words W = {x1, x2, ..., xm} to be enhanced, for each word xi \u2208W , a set of words Si = {y1, y2, ..., yn} that are similar to xi is manually selected from the training data. The similarity can be defined in terms of either syntactic roles or semantic meanings. We assume that, for each yj \u2208 Si, if there exist an n-gram of yj in the training corpora, the corresponding n-gram of xi should also have a relative higher probability of appearance. As the probabilities are represented as the weights in the G graph in FST, according to this assumption, the new weight (probability) of xi can be updated by the equation (2).\nwxi = wyj + ln( fxi\nfxi + fyj ) + \u03b8 (2)\nwhere \u03b8 is a parameter that tunes the enhancement scale. Note that according to (2), a larger fxi leads to a higher wxi , which means that a more frequent word (still low-frequency) is assigned a larger weights after enhancement, and so the rank of the low-frequency words in probabilities is preserved. However, if the word xi is a new word, the logarithm term can be ignored. Then the FST can be updated with the new weight. Let A(yj) denote the set of all the transitions of the word yj . A(yj) can be retrieved by searching through the G graph. For each transition (s, t, yj : yj/wyj \u2208 A(yj) in the G graph, check if a transition (s, t, xi : xi/wxi) exist in G for xi. If it exists, the wight wxi will be adjusted to a new weight w\u2032xi , otherwise, a parallel arc of transition (s, t, xi : xi/w\u2032xi) will be added. The new weight w\u2032xi can be calculated by the equation (2).\nAn example of the enhancement process is illustrated in Fig. 2, where Fig. 2(a) shows the G graph before the enhancement, and Fig. 2(b) shows the G graph after the enhancement. Note that \u2018a\u2019 is the high-frequency word, and (a,c) forms a similar pair. A new transition has been added in Fig. 2(b) for the low-frequency word c.\nComparing with the original similar pairs method, in this extension method each low-frequency or new words xi will be enhanced by multiple high-frequency words rather than only one. This will increase the search space of the low-frequency word in the G graph. Since the corresponding high-frequency referral words in Si are selected to be similar to xi, the paths of xi which are added to G are most likely to be correct in grammar and reasonable in meaning.\nIn addition, multiple referral words provide more nearly complete information especially in multi-lingual situation, since the one-to-one correspondence are merely existed in few occasions. The usage of a word in one language could have multiple variants in another language. It has been verified by our experiment results in the section 5."}, {"heading": "5. Experiment", "text": "The bilingual ASR tasks in the telecom domain is chosen to evaluate the proposed approach.

The Chinese LM is trained on a corpus including the transcription of the AM training speech and some logs of web-based customer service systems in the domain of telecom service.\n22 similar pairs are selected to evaluate the performance of the similar-pair method. Each similar pair contains 1\u223c5 high-frequency Chinese words and 1\u223c4 new English words. A \u2018FOREIGN\u2019 test set was deliberately designed to test the enhancement with these similar pairs, which consists of 42 sentences from online speech recording. For each transcription, some new English words that appear in the similar pairs are involved.\nAdditionally, a \u2018GENERAL\u2019 test set that involves 2608 utterances is selected as a control group to test the generalizability of the proposed method. Each utterance in this set contains words in various frequencies and therefore it can be used to examine if the proposed method impacts general performance of ASR systems at the time of enhancing low-frequency and new words."}, {"heading": "5.2.

Experiment result and analysis", "text": "The ASR performance in terms of the word error rate (WER) is presented in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. We report the results on two test sets: \u2018GENERAL\u2019 and \u2018FOREIGN\u2019, and the results with different values of the enhancement scale \u03b8 and different amounts of high-frequency Chinese words are presented. It can be seen that with the similar-pair-based enhancement, the ASR performance on utterances with new English words is significantly improved. In addition, comparing with the approach of one high-frequency Chinese word, the approach of multiple high-frequency Chinese words has better results. Interestingly, the enhancement on these infrequent words does not cause degradation on the other Chinese words in \u2018GENERAL\u2019 test set. Moreover, the performance on the \u2018GENERAL\u2019 test set nearly remains unchanged, which indicates that the proposed approach does not impact general performance of ASR systems, and thus is safe to employ. For a more clear presentation, the trends of WERs on the two test sets with different values of \u03b8 and different amounts of high-frequency Chinese words are presented in Fig. 3.\n1http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/ 2http://www.openfst.org\nTo further examine the gains offered by the proposed approach, the name entity error rate (NEER) is used. In contrast to the WER that measures the accuracy on all words, the NEER evaluates the accuracy on focused words, i.e., the words to enhance (the new English words) and the other Chinese words in \u2018GENERAL\u2019 test set. The results are presented in Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6. It can be seen that the similar-pair-based enhancement does deliver a much better accuracy on the new English words. Importantly, the improvement on the infrequent words does not impact the performance on the other Chinese words in \u2018GENERAL\u2019 test set, which confirms the effectiveness and safety of the proposed method.

The probabilities of these words, which are often important name entities, are generally underestimated by the language model (LM) due to their limited occurrences in the training data. Recently, we proposed a wordpair approach to deal with the problem, which borrows information of frequent words to enhance the probabilities of lowfrequency words. This paper presents an extension to the wordpair method by involving multiple \u2018predicting words\u2019 to produce better estimation for low-frequency words. We also employ this approach to deal with out-of-language words in the task of multi-lingual speech recognition.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
