Given a set of well-formed formulae (wffs) \u2206 in some non-monotonic logic (NML), the arguments and attacks defined by \u2206 instantiate a Dung argumentation framework. Additionally, a preference relation over the defined arguments can be used to determine which attacks succeed as defeats. The justified arguments are then evaluated under various Dung semantics, and the claims of the sceptically justified arguments1 identify the inferences from the underlying \u2206.\n1i.e. the arguments contained in all extensions under some semantics.\nMore formally, given an argumentation framework AF and a wff \u03b8, the argumentation-defined inference relation |\u223cAF over \u2206 is \u2206 |\u223cAF \u03b8 iff \u03b8 is the conclusion of a sceptically justified argument in AF . Indeed, a correspondence has been shown between |\u223cAF over \u2206, and the instantiating logic\u2019s non-monotonic inference relation defined directly over \u2206. For example, Reiter\u2019s default logic (DL) [7], logic programming [7], defeasible logic [9] and Brewka\u2019s preferred subtheories [12] have all been been endowed with argumentation semantics. This in turn allows the application of argument game proof theories [11] to the process of inference, and the generalisation of these dialectical proof theories to distributed NMR amongst computational agents, whereby agents can engage in argumentation-based dialogues, submitting arguments and counter-arguments from their own non-monotonic knowledge bases [1,10,14]. Furthermore, argumentative characterisations of NMR make use of principles familiar in everyday reasoning and debate, thus rendering transparent the reasons for accepting a conclusion and allowing for human participation and inspection of the inference process.\nOne well-studied NML that has not yet been endowed with argumentation semantics is Brewka\u2019s prioritised default logic (PDL) [3]. PDL is important because it upgrades DL [16] with priorities over defaults2. PDL has also been used to represent the (possibly conflicting) beliefs, obligations, intentions and desires (BOID) of agents, and model how these different categories of mental attitudes override each other in order to generate goals and actions that attain those goals [5].\nIn this note, we endow PDL with argumentation semantics and prove a correspondence between PDL inference and the inference relation defined by the argumentation semantics. We achieve this by appropriately instantiating the ASPIC+ framework for structured argumentation [12, 13]. ASPIC+ identifies conditions under which logics and preference relations instantiating Dung\u2019s frameworks satisfy the rationality postulates of [6]. In Section 2, we review ASPIC+ and PDL. In Section 3, we identify an error in the proof of [12, page 376, Proposition 21], which forces us to slightly modify our choice of argument preference relations in Section 2.2. In Section 4, we define a PDL instantiation of ASPIC+. This will involve studying preference relations thus far not considered by ASPIC+. We then present a representation theorem proving that inferences defined by the argumentation semantics correspond exactly to inferences in PDL. In Section 5, we discuss to what extent is this ASPIC+ instantiation normatively rational. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude with future work and some remarks about our approach.\nIn Appendix A, we prove some properties of a non-ASPIC+ argument preference relation, that is relevant to the PDL instantiation. In Appendix B, we prove an intermediate result necessary for the proof of the representation theorem.\n2So that, for example, one can account for recent information taking priority over information in the distant past, or that more specific information should take priority over more general information."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "In the remainder of this paper we make use of the following notation: N is the set of natural numbers, with N+ := N\u2212 {0}.

Undefined quantities are denoted by \u2217, for example 1/0 = \u2217 in the real numbers.

For two sets A, B their symmetric difference is A B := (A\u2212B) \u222a (B \u2212A)."}, {"heading": "2.1 Dung\u2019s Abstract Argumentation Theory", "text": "We now recap the important definitions of [7]. A (Dung) argumentation framework is a directed graph \u3008A, C\u3009, where A is the set of arguments and C \u2286 A2 is the conflict relation over A. For arguments A, B \u2208 A we write C(A, B)\u21d4 (A, B) \u2208 C \u21d4 A conflicts with B, i.e. A is used as a counterargument against B. Note that C can denote either an attack relation defined by a set of instantiating formulae, or the defeat relation defined by determining which attacks succeed as defeats.\nIn what follows let S \u2286 A be a set of arguments and A, B \u2208 A. S conflicts with B iff (\u2203A \u2208 S) C(A, B). S is conflict-free (cf) iff C\u2229S2 = \u2205. S defends A iff (\u2200B \u2208 A) [C(B, A)\u21d2 S conflicts with B]. Let Def(S) := {A \u2208 A S defends A}. Then, S is an admissible set iff S is cf and S \u2286 Def(S). An admissible set S is:\n\u2022 a complete extension iff Def(S) \u2286 S;\n\u2022 a preferred extension iff S is a \u2286-maximal complete extension;\n\u2022 the grounded extension iff S is the \u2286-least complete extension;\n\u2022 a stable extension iff S is complete and conflicts with all arguments in A\u2212 S.\nS := {complete, preferred, grounded, stable} is the set of Dung semantics. An argument A \u2208 A is sceptically justified under the semantics s \u2208 S iff A belongs to all s extensions.\n2.2 The ASPIC+ Framework\nDung\u2019s framework provides an intuitive calculus of opposition for determining the justified arguments based on conflict alone. However, it abstracts from the internal logical structure of arguments, the nature of defeats and how they are determined by preferences, and consideration of the conclusions of the arguments. However, these features are referenced when studying whether any given logical instantiation of a framework yields complete extensions that satisfy the rationality postulates of [6]. ASPIC+ [12, 13] provides a structured account of abstract argumentation, allowing one to reference the above features, while at\nthe same time accommodating a wide range of instantiating logics and preference relations. ASPIC+ then identifies conditions under which the instantiation (given arguments, attacks and preferences) results in complete extensions that satisfy the rationality postulates of [6]; such instantiations are normatively rational."}, {"heading": "2.2.1 Construction of Arguments and Knowledge Bases", "text": "An (ASPIC+) argumentation system is \u3008L, \u2212, Rs, Rd, n\u3009 where L is a logical language, \u2212 : L \u2192 P(L) is the contrary function \u03b8 7\u2192 \u03b8 that identifies when one wff in L conflicts with another. Let \u03b81, . . . , \u03b8m, \u03c6 \u2208 L be wffs for m \u2208 N, Rs is the set of strict inference rules of the form (\u03b81, . . . , \u03b8m \u2192 \u03c6), denoting that if \u03b81, . . . , \u03b8m are true then \u03c6 is true no matter what, and Rd is the set of defeasible inference rules of the form (\u03b81, . . . , \u03b8m \u21d2 \u03c6), denoting that if \u03b81, . . . , \u03b8m are true then \u03c6 is true, unless there are good reasons not to accept \u03c6. Finally n : Rd \u2192 L is a partial function that assigns a name to some of the defeasible rules.\nFor each rule r \u2208 Rs \u222aRd we define two functions:\n1. The antecedent map is\nAnte : R \u2192 Pfin(L) r := (\u03b81, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b8m \u2192 /\u21d2 \u03c6) 7\u2192 Ante(r) := {\u03b81, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b8m} .

(2.2)\nThe names of the rules are unique, i.e. if Ante(r) = Ante(r\u2032) and Cons(r) = Cons(r\u2032), then r = r\u2032. By equality we mean syntactic equality with respect to the instantiating logic, e.g. if L is propositional logic, \u00ac(\u03b8 \u2192 \u03c6) 6= (\u03b8\u2227\u00ac\u03c6). Two rules r, r\u2032 are equal iff Ante(r) = Ante(r\u2032) (syntactically) and Cons(r) = Cons(r\u2032) (syntactically).\nAn (ASPIC+) knowledge base is a set K := Kn \u222a Kp \u2286 L where Kn is the set of axioms and Kp is the set of ordinary premises. Intuitively, the knowledge base consists of the premises used in constructing arguments. Note that K does not have to be a finite set. Given an argumentation system and knowledge base, an (ASPIC+) argument is defined inductively:\n1. (Base) [\u03b8] is a singleton (ASPIC+) argument with \u03b8 \u2208 K, conclusion Conc([\u03b8]) := \u03b8, premise set {\u03b8} \u2286 K and top rule TopRule([\u03b8]) := \u2217.\n2.

If r := (Conc(A1), . . . , Conc(An)\u2192 \u03c6) \u2208 Rs, then B := [A1, . . . , An \u2192 \u03c6] is also an ASPIC+ argument with conclusion Conc(B) = \u03c6, premise set Prem(B) := \u22c3n i=1 Prem(Ai) \u2286 K and TopRule(B) = r \u2208 Rs.\n3. (Inductive, defeasible) Let 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n be an index. For each such i let Ai be an ASPIC+ argument with conclusion Conc(Ai) and premise set Prem(Ai). If r\u2032 := (Conc(A1), . . . , Conc(An)\u21d2 \u03c6) \u2208 Rd, then C := [A1, . . . , An \u21d2 \u03c6] is also an ASPIC+ argument with conclusion Conc(C) = \u03c6, premise set Prem(C) := \u22c3n i=1 Prem(Ai) \u2286 K and TopRule(C) = r\u2032 \u2208 Rd.\nLet A be the (unique) set of all arguments constructed in this way. It is clear that arguments are finite objects."}, {"heading": "2.2.2 Properties of Arguments", "text": "A subargument B of A is (informally) an argument where Prem(B) \u2286 Prem(A) and Conc(B) appears as an intermediate conclusion of A attained by the application of the exact same rules3.

It is easy to show that \u2286arg is a preorder and \u2282arg is a strict partial order on A. Informally, two arguments are equal iff they are constructed identically in the above manner4. Further, a set S \u2286 A is subargment closed iff (\u2200A \u2208 S)Sub(A) \u2286 S.\nAn argument A \u2208 A is firm iff Prem(A) \u2286 Kn, i.e. all of its premises are axioms. Further, DR(A) \u2286 Rd is the set of defeasible rules applied in constructing A. An argument A is strict iff DR(A) = \u2205, else A is defeasible.\nWe define the conclusion map\nConc : A \u2192 L A 7\u2192 Conc(A) , (2.3)\nwhich takes an argument and returns its conclusion5. We can generalise this to sets of arguments as follows:\nConc\u2032 : P (A)\u2192 P (L) S 7\u2192 Conc\u2032(S) := \u22c3 A\u2208S Conc(A) .

Similarly, one can also define Prem : A \u2192 Pfin (L), DR : A \u2192 Pfin (Rd), TopRule : A \u2192 R from how arguments are constructed, and generalise their domains from single arguments A to sets of arguments P (A).

This will make \u2286arg into a partial order.\n5Do not confuse Conc : A \u2192 L with Cons : R\u2192 L (Equation 2.2, page 5).\nthough each argument is mapped to its finite set of premises or defeasible rules, the set of arguments can be infinite and the union of infinitely many finite sets does not have to be finite."}, {"heading": "2.2.3 Attacks", "text": "An argument A attacks another argument B, denoted as A \u21c0 B, iff at least one of the following hold, where:6\n1.

A set of arguments S \u2286 A is defeat-conflict-free (defeat-cf) iff S2\u2229 \u21aa\u2192= \u2205.\n6See [13, Section 2] for a further discussion of why attacks are distinguished in this way.\nWhat is the difference between attack-cf and defeat-cf? Clearly, attack-cf implies defeat-cf but the converse is not true. [12] argues that attack-cf should be the correct notion of conflict-freeness to use when invoking Dung semantics, because the presence of attacks denote disagreement between two arguments, and ideally an agent should not accept two arguments that disagree with each other. However, one can also argue that defeat-cf is the correct notion of conflictfreeness to use (e.g. [15]), because an agent can accept two arguments that attack each other, knowing also that the attack does not succeed due to the preference relation. In the upcoming sections, we will prove the stronger result of attack-cf whenever it is possible to, and defeat-cf follows.\nIn ASPIC+, preferences over arguments are calculated from the argument structure through comparing the fallible information (ordinary premises and defeasible rules) they contain. More formally, Kp and Rd are endowed with preorders \u2264\u2032 and \u2264\u2032\u2032 respectively7. This preorder is then lifted to a set-comparison order E between the (finite) sets of premises or defeasible rules of the arguments, and then finally to -, following the method in [12, Section 5].\nWe now recap this lifting of the preorder <\u2032\u2032 from Rd to Pfin (Rd). We omit comparing premises because in our instantiation we only compare defeasible rules as there are no ordinary premises (Section 4, page 16).\nMore formally, ASPIC+ considers two ordering principles called democratic and elitist [12, Section 5]8, such that for A, B \u2208 A and DR(A) \u2286 Rd, we define A - B to be\nDR(A) EEli DR(B) (2.6)\nor DR(A) EDem DR(B) , (2.7)\nwhere, for9 \u0393, \u0393\u2032 \u2286fin Rd,\n\u0393 EEli \u0393 \u2032 \u21d4 [\u0393 = \u0393\u2032 or \u0393 /Eli \u0393\u2032] , (2.8)\n\u0393 /Eli \u0393 \u2032 \u21d4 (\u2203x \u2208 \u0393) (\u2200y \u2208 \u0393\u2032) x <\u2032\u2032 y , (2.9) \u0393 EDem \u0393 \u2032 \u21d4 [\u0393 = \u0393\u2032 or \u0393 /Dem \u0393\u2032] , and (2.10)\n\u0393 /Dem \u0393 \u2032 \u21d4 (\u2200x \u2208 \u0393) (\u2203y \u2208 \u0393\u2032) x <\u2032\u2032 y , (2.11)\nIt is easy to show that - in both cases is a preorder on A. We define equivalence of arguments as follows:\nA \u2248 B \u21d4 DR(A) = DR(B) . (2.12)\nNote that Equations 2.8 and 2.9 are not exactly the same as [12, page 375, Definition 19]. We will explain this in Section 3 (page 11).\nIn summary, when comparing two arguments A, B \u2208 A, A - B iff [A \u2248 B (Equation 2.12) or A \u227a B].

Its corresponding defeat graph is \u3008A, \u21aa\u2192\u3009, where \u21aa\u2192 is defined in terms of \u21c0 and - as in Equation 2.5."}, {"heading": "2.2.5 Applying Dung\u2019s Semantics", "text": "Given \u3008A, \u21aa\u2192\u3009 one can then evaluate the extensions under Dung\u2019s semantics (Section 2.1, page 4), and thus identify the argumentation defined inferences as the conclusions of the sceptically justified arguments as follows.

Intuitively, W are the known facts and D the defaults that nonmonotonically extend W . We will consider finite PDTs unless otherwise specified.\nA PDT\u2019s inferences are defined by its extensions. Formally, let \u227a+\u2287\u227a be a linearisation13 of \u227a. An extension (with respect to \u227a+) is a set E := \u22c3 i\u2208NEi \u2286 SL built inductively as:\nE0 := Th(W ) and (2.13)\nEi+1 :=\n{ Ei + \u03c6 , condition 1\nEi , else (2.14)\nwhere \u201ccondition 1\u201d iff \u201c\u03c6 is the consequent of the \u227a+-greatest default d active in Ei\u201d.

If \u227a is already total then there is only one way to apply the defaults in D (Equation 2.14), hence the extension is unique and all inferences are sceptical. In what follows, we will use \u227a+ to emphasise that the order is total.\nOne application of PDL is in modelling how an agent reasons with her beliefs, obligations, intentions and desires (BOID).\nExample 1. Suppose a research assistant Alice (a) is considering whether she should teach undergraduates. We can model her mental attitudes as a BOID agent\u2019s PDT [5] as follows. Define the predicates R(x) \u21d4 \u201cx is a research assistant\u201d, A(x) \u21d4 \u201cx is an academic\u201d, and T (x) \u21d4 \u201cx is teaching\n12 We have defined the order dually to [3] so as to comply with orderings over the ASPIC+\ndefeasible inference rules. 13i.e. \u227a+ is a strict total order and hence \u2329 D, \u227a+ \u232a is a strict toset (totally ordered set).\n(undergraduates)\u201d. Alice is a research assistant, so W = {R(a)}. She believes that research assistants are academics, so her set of beliefs Bel has the default R(a):A(a) A(a) . She does not want to teach and would rather focus on her research, so her set of desires Des include R(a):\u00acT (a)\u00acT (a) . However, she is obliged to teach, so her set of obligations Obl include A(a):T (a)T (a) . The set of defaults is D = Bel\u222aDes\u222aObl, and we assume no other defaults are relevant for this example.\nIn [5], the relative prioritisations of categories of mental attitudes define different agent types. For example, if Alice is a realistic selfish agent, the priority (abuse of notation) is Obl \u227a+ Des \u227a+ Bel, and therefore the extension is Th ({R(a), A(a), \u00acT (a)}). She thus generates the goal \u00acT (a), i.e. she does not teach. However, if she is a realistic social agent, the priority (abuse of notation) is Des \u227a+ Obl \u227a+ Bel, and therefore she teaches, as T (a) is in the extension.\n3 The Corrected ASPIC+ Preferences"}, {"heading": "3.1 Overview of the Problem", "text": "In this section, we show that the elitist set comparison relation [12, page 375, Definition 19] is not reasonable inducing and hence cannot guarantee normative rationality.

(The following proof, from [12, page 390, Proposition 21], is incorrect) We know that EEli is transitive and satisfies Property 2(a) of reasonable inducing (Definition 3.1, page 11) from Equation 3.2.

EEli is not reasonable inducing.\nProof. Immediate from Definition 3.1 (page 11) and Lemma 3.2 (page 13).\nThis failure of the property of being reasonable inducing allows for counterexamples like [8, Example 5.1]. In that example, two defeasible rules can be equivalent under a suitable preorder without being equal.

For example, for the elitist weakest link order, EEli:\nExample 3. Consider the LPDT \u3008D, W, \u227a+\u3009 where W = {a},\nD = { d1 := a : b\nb , d2 :=\nb : c\nc , d3 := b : \u00acc \u00acc\n} (4.5)\nand d1 \u227a+ d2 \u227a+ d3.

Therefore the elitist weakest link ordering cannot be used to calculate -."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 The Disjoint Elitist Order", "text": "One can introduce the disjoint elitist order, EDEli, which ignores shared rules when comparing arguments. This is intuitive because when comparing two arguments we should only focus on the fallible information on which the arguments differ. It is defined as\n\u0393 /DEli \u0393 \u2032 \u21d4 (\u2203x \u2208 \u0393\u2212 \u0393\u2032) (\u2200y \u2208 \u0393\u2032 \u2212 \u0393) x <\u2032\u2032 y , (4.6)\nwith argument equivalence A \u2248 B \u21d4 DR(A) = DR(B) and EDEli defined as usual. We call <\u2032\u2032 the underlying (strict) total order of /DEli.\nIf we replace Equation 2.8 with /DEli, then from r2 < \u2032\u2032 r3, it is easy to see that in Example 3, A \u227a B, B 6\u227a A, and so A 6\u21aa\u2192 B and B \u21aa\u2192 A, and hence there is only a single stable extension containing the now sceptically justified argument B with conclusion \u00acc. This at least repairs the correspondence in Example 3.\nThe disjoint elitist order also satisfies a very intuitive property:\nLemma 4.1. (\u2200A, B \u2208 A) [DR(A) \u2286 DR(B)\u21d2 B - A].\nProof. If DR(B) = DR(A) then B \u2248 A, so B - A. If DR(A) \u2282 DR(B), then DR(A)\u2212DR(B) = \u2205, which means B \u227a A is vacuously true from Equation 4.6 so B - A follows.\nFormally, this result states that EDEli extends the superset relation on Pfin (Rd). Intuitively, this means that the more defeasible rules your argument contains, the less preferred it will become. It is rational for agents to prefer more certainty than less, with all else being equal18. The extreme case is that arguments with no defeasible rules, i.e. strict arguments, are most preferred.\nThe above two intuitions of (1) ignoring shared elements of the sets being compared and (2) the order extends the superset relation have been considered in a different context and for a different order by [4].\nThe disjoint elitist order also satisfies the following property: if \u3008Rd, <\u2032\u2032\u3009 is a strict toset, then \u3008Pfin(Rd), /DEli\u3009 is also a strict toset. Further, \u2205 is the EDEli-greatest element in Pfin(Rd), and Rd (if finite) is the EDEli-least element. See Appendix A (page 38) for proofs of these properties.\nUnfortunately, despite these desirable properties, there is a counterexample which shows the disjoint elitist order cannot be used to provide the correspondence with PDL.\n18More precisely, if the agent has two arguments, A and B, such that A is less certain than B because A uses more defeasible rules, then with all else being equal, the agent should prefer B over A. However, we do not demand that the agent must first seek complete certainty in the sense of Descartes (especially given limited knowledge and cognitive resources) prior to proposing an argument in a dialogue.\nExample 4. Consider the LPDT \u3008D,W,\u227a+\u3009 where D = {d1, d2, d3, d4, d5}, W = \u2205 and\nd1 := > : a1 a1 , d4 := a3 : a4 a4 , d3 := > : a3 a3 , d2 := a1 : a2 a2 , d5 := a1 : \u00ac(a2 \u2227 a4) \u00ac(a2 \u2227 a4) ,\nsuch that d1 \u227a+ d4 \u227a+ d3 \u227a+ d2 \u227a+ d5. Our PDE is constructed in the usual manner starting from E0 = Th(\u2205). By Equation 2.14 (page 10), the order of the application of the defaults is d3, d4, d1, d5, with d2 blocked.\nE1 = E0 + a3, E2 = E1 + a4, E3 = E2 + a1, E4 = E3 + \u00ac(a2 \u2227 a4) , (4.7)\nand Ek = E4 for all k \u2265 5. The default d2 is blocked because \u00ac(a2 \u2227 a4) \u2261 (\u00aca2 \u2228 \u00aca4), and with a4 (from d4), we have \u00aca2, which blocks d2. The unique PDE from this LPDT is\nE = Th ({a1, a3, a4,\u00ac(a2 \u2227 a4)}) = Th({a1,\u00aca2, a3, a4}) . (4.8)\nNow consider the corresponding arguments from our instantiation. We have the defeasible rules19\nr1 < \u2032\u2032 r4 < \u2032\u2032 r3 < \u2032\u2032 r2 < \u2032\u2032 r5 . (4.9)\nThe relevant arguments and sets of defeasible rules are\nA := [[> \u21d2 a1]\u21d2 a2] , DR(A) = {r1, r2} (4.10) B := [[> \u21d2 a3]\u21d2 a4] , DR(B) = {r3, r4} (4.11) C := [[> \u21d2 a1]\u21d2 \u00ac(a2 \u2227 a4)] , DR(C) = {r1, r5} , (4.12) D := [B,C \u2192 \u00aca2] , DR(D) = {r1, r3, r4, r5} , (4.13)\nWe illustrate these arguments in Figure 4.1. The stable extension is {D, B, C, [> \u21d2 a3], [> \u21d2 a1]} and all strict extensions thereof20. The conclusion set does correspond to Equation 4.8. However, this would require D \u21aa\u2192 A, which means, by Equation 2.5 (page 7), D \u21c0 A and D 6\u227a A. Clearly, D \u21c0 A on A.

(4.14)\n19Where, similar to Example 3, ri corresponds to di via Equation 4.2 (page 16). 20Informally, in ASPIC+, for S \u2286 A the strict extension of S is the smallest set containing S extended with all strict and firm arguments, and all possible applications of strict rules to those arguments. This becomes the deductive closure when ASPIC+ is instantiated into classical logic. See [12, page 370, Definition 17] for more details.\nFrom Equation 4.9, it is not the case that r2 < \u2032\u2032 r1, r3, r4, so we conclude D \u227a A. Therefore, argumentation does not generate the corresponding stable extension to Equation 4.8."}, {"heading": "4.2.3 Mimicking Prioritised Default Logic", "text": "Despite not being suitable for our desired correspondence between ASPIC+ and PDL, the disjoint elitist order does capture one important intuition. When comparing two arguments A, B \u2208 A, we compare them at their defeasible rules, and whichever argument has the <\u2032\u2032-least rule in the set DR(A) DR(B) is the less preferred argument. However, comparing sets of defeasible rules does not take the structure of arguments into account, i.e. in terms of which rules in the construction of arguments could be applied earlier, and which could be applied later. We now transform <\u2032\u2032 into a new order, <SP , called the structure preference order, such that it gives the correct argument preference for the correspondence.\nLet \u3008Rd, <\u2032\u2032\u3009 be given. Given R \u2286 Rd, we define the set Args(R) \u2286 A to be the set of arguments such that A \u2208 Args(R) \u21d4 DR(A) \u2286 R. We call this set the set of arguments freely constructed with defeasible rules in R. It can be easily shown that Args is \u2286-monotonic in R and that the assignment R 7\u2192 Args(R) is functional. Clearly, Args(\u2205) is the set of all strict arguments, and Args (Rd) = A. Further, Args(R) is subargument-closed, i.e.\nCorollary 4.2. If A \u2208 Args(R) and B \u2286arg A, then B \u2208 Args(R), for any R \u2286 Rd.\nProof. It is easy to show that if A \u2286arg B, then DR(A) \u2286 DR(B). Therefore, if A \u2208 Args(R), then DR(A) \u2286 R, and hence DR(B) \u2286 R. Therefore, B \u2208 Args(R).\nFor R \u2286 Rd let max<\u2032\u2032 R \u2286 R denote the set of all <\u2032\u2032-maximal elements of R. As <\u2032\u2032 is a (strict) total order and Rd is finite, this is a singleton set. For r \u2208 Rd recall the Ante map (Equation 2.1, page 5). Note that we are considering defeasible rules with one antecedent, so Ante(r) is a singleton set. For S \u2286 A recall the Conc map (Equation 2.4, page 6).\nConsider ordering the rules in Rd as follows: for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 |Rd|, we define the singleton set {ai} \u2286 Rd to be\nmax <\u2032\u2032 {r \u2208 Rd Ante(r) \u2286 Conc(Args(i\u22121\u22c3 k=1 {ak} ))} \u2212 i\u22121\u22c3 j=1 {aj}  . (4.15) More concretely,\n{a1} = max <\u2032\u2032 {r \u2208 Rd Ante(r) \u2286 Conc (Args (\u2205))} , {a2} = max <\u2032\u2032 ({r \u2208 Rd Ante(r) \u2286 Conc (Args ({a1}))} \u2212 {a1}) , {a3} = max <\u2032\u2032 ({r \u2208 Rd Ante(r) \u2286 Conc (Args ({a1, a2}))} \u2212 {a1, a2}) ,\nand so on, until this process stops at { a|Rd| } 21. The intuition is: a1 is the most preferred rule whose antecedent is amongst the conclusions of all strict (and firm) arguments, a2 is the next most preferred rule, whose antecedent is amongst the conclusions of all arguments having at most a1 as a defeasible rule. Similarly, a3 is the next most preferred rule, whose antecedent is amongst the conclusions of all arguments having at most a1 and a2 as defeasible rules, and so on until all of the rules of Rd are exhausted. This process orders the rules by how preferred they are under <\u2032\u2032 and by how earlier they are applicable when constructing the arguments.\nWe then define (notice the dual order)\nai <SP aj \u21d4 j < i , (4.16)\nwhere 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 |Rd|. We define the non-strict order to be ai \u2264SP ai \u21d4 [ai = aj or ai <SP aj ]. This makes sense because i 7\u2192 ai is bijective between Rd and {1, 2, 3, . . . , |Rd|}. Clearly <SP is a strict total order on Rd. We call this the structure preference order on Rd, which exists and is unique given <\u2032\u2032. The corresponding argument preference, \u227aSP , is <SP under the disjoint elitist order22, i.e.\nA \u227aSP B \u21d4 (\u2203x \u2208 DR(A)\u2212DR(B)) (\u2200y \u2208 DR(B)\u2212DR(A)) x <SP y , (4.17)\n21This is just Equation 4.15 with i = |Rd|, which is where the assumption that Rd is a finite set is crucial.\n22We use the disjoint elitist order instead of the usual elitist order because Example 3 (page 17) shows that the usual elitist order does not give the correspondence.\nwith -SP defined as usual. We can also define the corresponding set comparison relation, /SP , as, for \u0393, \u0393 \u2032 \u2286fin Rd,\n\u0393 /SP \u0393 \u2032 \u21d4 (\u2203x \u2208 \u0393\u2212 \u0393\u2032) (\u2200y \u2208 \u0393\u2032 \u2212 \u0393)x <SP y , (4.18)\nsuch that \u0393 ESP \u0393\u2032 \u21d4 [\u0393 /SP \u0393\u2032 or \u0393 = \u0393\u2032], and\nA -SP B \u21d4 DR(A) ESP DR(B) . (4.19)\nThe name \u201cstructure preference order\u201d refers to the fact that this order takes into account both the preference <\u2032\u2032 and the structure, i.e. when the rule is first applicable during the construction of arguments. This allows us to imitate how PDL applies defaults when calculating extensions.\nExample 5. (Example 4, page 19 continued) We have the following:\n{a1} = max <\u2032\u2032 ({r \u2208 Rd Ante(r) \u2286 Conc (Args (\u2205))} \u2212\u2205)\n= max <\u2032\u2032 {r \u2208 Rd Ante(r) \u2286 {>}} = max <\u2032\u2032 {r1, r3} = {r3} =\u21d2 a1 = r3 .\n{a2} = max <\u2032\u2032 ({r \u2208 Rd Ante(r) \u2286 Conc (Args ({r3}))} \u2212 {r3})\n= max <\u2032\u2032\n({r1, r3, r4} \u2212 {r3})\n= max <\u2032\u2032 {r1, r4} = {r4} =\u21d2 a2 = r4 .\n{a3} = max <\u2032\u2032 ({r \u2208 Rd Ante(r) \u2286 Conc (Args ({r3, r4}))} \u2212 {r3, r4})\n= max <\u2032\u2032\n({r1, r3, r4} \u2212 {r3, r4})\n= max <\u2032\u2032 {r1} =\u21d2 a3 = r1 .\n{a4} = max <\u2032\u2032 ({r \u2208 Rd Ante(r) \u2286 Conc (Args ({r3, r4, r1}))} \u2212 {r1, r3, r4})\n= max <\u2032\u2032\n({r2, r5, r1, r3, r4} \u2212 {r1, r3, r4})\n= max <\u2032\u2032 {r2, r5} = {r5} =\u21d2 a4 = r5 .\n{a5} = {r2} =\u21d2 a5 = r2 .\nTherefore, we have\na1 = r3, a2 = r4, a3 = r1, a4 = r5, a5 = r2 . (4.20)\nThe structure preference order is\nr2 <SP r5 <SP r1 <SP r4 <SP r3 . (4.21)\nNotice that this is precisely the order of how the corresponding normal defaults are added in PDL, as Equation 4.7 (page 19) shows. It is easy to show that the corresponding stable extension under \u227aSP corresponds to the PDL inference, because r2 is now <SP -least, so D 6\u227aSP A by Equation 4.14 (page 19).\nHowever, <SP does not necessarily follow the PDL order of applying defaults as the following example illustrates.\nExample 6. Consider the LPDT \u3008D, W, \u227a+\u3009 where W = {a}, d1 := a:\u00aca\u00aca and d2 := >:b b , such that d2 \u227a\n+ d1. The prioritised default extension is E = Th ({a, b}), where d1 is blocked by W , so d2 is the only default added.\nTranslating this to argumentation, we have Kn = {a}, r1 := (a\u21d2 \u00aca) and r2 := (> \u21d2 b) where for i = 1, 2, ri = f (di), such that r2 <\u2032\u2032 r1. The arguments are A0 := [a], A1 := [A0 \u21d2 \u00aca] and B := [> \u21d2 b]. Applying Equation 4.15 (page 21), we have r2 <SP r1, which clearly is not the order of how the corresponding defaults are added in PDL.\nYet the correspondence still holds. Clearly A0 \u21aa\u2192 A1 because A0 is strict, so the stable extension is the strict extension of {A0, B}, the conclusion set of which is the extension from PDL.\nExample 6 highlights how blocked defaults and defeated arguments are related.

The construction of the unique stable extension mimics how extensions are constructed over an LPDT (Equation 2.14, page 10). Given a set of arguments S \u2286 A we define, for r \u2208 Rd, S \u2295 r := Args(DR(S) \u222a {r}), i.e. we close S under all arguments with the addition of a new defeasible rule r. Now consider Algorithm 1. We input the ASPIC+ attack graph \u3008A, \u21c0, -SP \u3009 as described by the hypothesis of the theorem, and the algorithm outputs a set of arguments.\nAlgorithm 1 Generating a Stable Extension\n1: function GenerateStableExtension(\u3008A, \u21c0, -SP \u3009) 2: S \u2190 Args(\u2205) 3: for r \u2208 Rd from <SP -greatest to <SP -smallest do 4: if S \u2295 r is attack-cf then 5: S \u2190 S \u2295 r\nreturn S\nThe intuition of this algorithm is to create the largest possible set of undefeated arguments, first by including all strict arguments because strict arguments are never defeated (Line 2) and never attack each other because Kn is consistent. Then, the algorithm includes the defeasible rules from most to least preferred and tests whether the resulting arguments that are constructed by the inclusion of such a defeasible rule leads to an attack (Lines 4\u20135). As <SP is total, all defeasible rules are considered. This algorithm halts because Rd is finite.\nIt is clear from the algorithm that S exists and is unique, because S is a set of freely-constructed arguments (i.e. of the form Args(R) for some R \u2286 Rd) including as many mutually compatible defeasible rules as possible. We now show that S is a stable extension [2, page 26 Definition 2.2.7].\nAttack-cf: This is guaranteed by the consistency of Kn, so two strict arguments cannot attack each other, and that defeasible rules r \u2208 Rd are only added if attack-cf is preserved (Lines 4\u20135). Therefore, S must be attack-cf.\nDefeats all other arguments: Let R \u2286 Rd be the set of all defeasible rules added to S, i.e.\nR := DR(S) = \u22c3 A\u2208S DR(A) \u2286 Rd . (4.22)\nLet B /\u2208 S be any argument. As S = Args (DR(S)), this means there is some rule r \u2208 DR(B) such that r /\u2208 R. The only reason why r /\u2208 R is because if r were added to R, then the resulting S would not be attack-cf, according to Algorithm 1. Let B\u2032 \u2286arg B be such that TopRule(B\u2032) = r, which must exist by the inductive construction of arguments. Let A be the attacker of r, such that23\n23Note that A is appropriately chosen such that Conc(A) = \u00acCons(r) is syntactic equality. This is always possible because Rs has all rules of proof of FOL. Therefore, if an argument C concludes \u03b8, and we would want it to conclude \u03c6, where \u03c6 and \u03b8 are logically equivalent, we can just append the strict rule (\u03b8 \u2192 \u03c6) \u2208 Rs to C to create a new argument D that concludes \u03c6.\nConc(A) = \u00acCons(r) (Equation 2.2, page 5), so A \u21c0 B\u2032 and hence A \u21c0 B. There are two possibilities: either r is <SP -greatest or it is not.\nSuppose r is <SP -greatest, then Args (\u2205)\u2295r is not attack-cf, so A \u2208 Args(\u2205). As A is strict, A \u21aa\u2192 B\u2032, and hence A \u21aa\u2192 B.\nNow suppose r is not <SP -greatest. Consider the strict up-set of r in Rd,\nT := {r\u2032 \u2208 Rd r <SP r\u2032} 6= \u2205 . (4.23)\nThere are two sub-possibilities: either T \u2229R = \u2205 or T \u2229R 6= \u2205. If the former, then given that adding r to S will create an attack from A \u2208 Args(\u2205), we have A \u21aa\u2192 B. If the latter, i.e. T \u2229 R 6= \u2205, adding r to S means its attacker A \u21c0 B\u2032 is in Args (T \u2229R). Either A is strict or not strict (i.e. defeasible). If it is strict, then A \u21aa\u2192 B as before. If it is not strict, i.e. \u2205 6= DR(A) \u2286 T \u2229R, then by definition (\u2200s \u2208 T ) r <SP s. As DR(A) \u2286 T \u2229 R \u2286 T , we must also have (\u2200s \u2208 DR(A)) r <SP s. Therefore, there is an r \u2208 DR(B\u2032)\u2212DR(A) such that for all rules in DR(A), and hence DR(A)\u2212DR(B\u2032), r <SP s. By Equation 4.17 (page 21), we conclude that B\u2032 \u227aSP A, and hence A \u21aa\u2192 B\u2032. Therefore, by definition of \u21aa\u2192 and \u2286arg, A \u21aa\u2192 B.\nWe conclude that the defeat graphs of these ASPIC+ attack graphs have a unique stable extension."}, {"heading": "4.3.2 A Helpful Distinction in Prioritised Default Logic", "text": "In this section we formalise a distinction between defaults in PDL that are blocked because there exists something that disagrees with them, and defaults that are blocked because they do not add any new information.\nLet \u3008D, W, \u227a\u3009 be a PDT and E = \u22c3 i\u2208NEi one of its extensions generated from the linearisation \u227a+\u2287\u227a.

But in the case of \u227a+1 , b:cc is not active because it adds no new information, rather than that we know \u00acc already.\nWe wish to distinguish between inactive defaults that conflict with something we already know, and inactive defaults that add no new information. We call a default \u03b8:\u03c6\u03c6 semi-active (in S \u2286 SL) iff [\u03b8 \u2208 S, \u00ac\u03c6 /\u2208 S, \u03c6 \u2208 S].

Assume for contradiction that Args(R) is not attackcf, then (\u2203A, B \u2208 Args(R))A \u21c0 B. By definition, DR(B) \u2286 R = f (NBD(E)). Suppose A \u21c0 B on B\u2032 \u2286arg B, so (\u2203B\u2032\u2032 \u2286arg B) B\u2032 = [B\u2032\u2032 \u21d2 \u00acConc(A)] by Equation 4.4 (page 17). Let r = TopRule(B\u2032), so r = (Conc(B\u2032\u2032)\u21d2 \u00acConc(A)). Clearly r \u2208 DR(B), and hence f\u22121(r) = Conc(B\n\u2032\u2032):\u00acConc(A) \u00acConc(A) \u2208 NBD(E), and\n\u00acConc(A) \u2208 E. However, we also have DR(A) \u2286 R as well. Let {r1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , rn} \u2286 DR(A) be the set of defeasible rules such that W\u222a{Cons(r1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Cons(rn)} |= \u00acConc(A) (Cons is defined in Equation 2.2, page 5). For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n let di := f\u22121 (ri). Clearly the corresponding defaults d1, . . . , dn \u2208 NBE(E) and hence Cons(ri) \u2208 E for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. As E is deductively closed and W \u2286 E, then \u00acConc(A) \u2208 E. Therefore, E is inconsistent - contradiction, because W is consistent. Therefore, Args(R) is attack-cf.\n1.2 Args(R) defeats all other arguments:\nNow we show that Args(R) defeats all other arguments, by showing that for every argument B /\u2208 Args(R) there exists an argument in A \u2208 Args(R) such that A \u21aa\u2192 B. Let B /\u2208 Args(R) be arbitrary, which means there is some r \u2208 DR(B) such that r /\u2208 R. Let B\u2032 \u2286arg B be such that TopRule(B\u2032) = r. Let r = (\u03b8 \u21d2 \u03c6), so r /\u2208 R means f\u22121 (r) = \u03b8:\u03c6\u03c6 /\u2208 NBD(E). By Equation 4.27 (page 26), this means \u03b8 /\u2208 E or \u00ac\u03c6 \u2208 E. This gives us two possibilities: either \u03b8 /\u2208 E, or \u00ac\u03c6 \u2208 E.\n1.2.1 The case of \u00ac\u03c6 \u2208 E:\nAssume \u00ac\u03c6 \u2208 E, then (\u2203i \u2208 N) \u00ac\u03c6 \u2208 Ei by Equations 2.13 and 2.14 (page 10). Either i = 0 or i > 0.\n1.2.1.1 The case of i = 0:\nSuppose i = 0, then W |= \u00ac\u03c6 from Equation 2.13. By compactness, there is some finite W \u2032 \u2286 W such that W \u2032 |= \u00ac\u03c6. We can construct an argument\nA such that Prem(A) = W \u2032 and Conc(A) = \u00ac\u03c6 as there will be appropriate combinations of strict rules in Rs, so A \u21c0 B. As DR(A) = \u2205 \u2286 R, we must have A \u2208 Args(R). Further, as A is strict, A \u21aa\u2192 B is guaranteed25 by -SP .\n1.2.1.2 The case of i > 0:\nNow suppose i > 0, then \u00ac\u03c6 \u2208 Ej where j > 0 is the witness for i. Let dj \u2208 D be the default that is \u227a+-greatest active in the layer Ej , so the set of defaults that conclude \u00ac\u03b8 (up to the application of deductive rules) is S := {d0, . . . , dj\u22121} \u2286 GDj\u22121 (\u227a+) \u2286 NBD(E). We can construct an argument A such that Prem(A) \u2286 W , Conc(A) = \u00ac\u03c6 and DR(A) = f(S). Clearly, DR(A) = f(S) \u2286 f (NBD(E)) = R and hence A \u2208 Args (R). It is clear that A \u21c0 B, so we need to show B 6\u227aSP A.\nGiven that \u00ac\u03c6 \u2208 Ej , it must be the case that \u03c6 /\u2208 Ej . Therefore, r is not \u227a+-greatest active for all extension layers E0, . . . , Ej\u22121. Suppose for contradiction that there are some rules s \u2208 DR(A) that are <SP -smaller than r. Then by Equation 4.15 (page 21), r must be \u227a+-greatest active at some Ek for k < j \u2212 1, which would then result in \u03c6 in Ek+1, therefore preventing \u00ac\u03c6 \u2208 Ej - contradiction. Therefore, r is <SP -smaller than all rules in DR(A). By Equation 4.17, we must have B \u227aSP A, and hence A 6\u227aSP B, so A \u21aa\u2192 B. Therefore, for the case of \u00ac\u03c6 \u2208 E, Args(R) defeats all arguments outside it.\n1.2.2 The case of \u03b8 /\u2208 E:\nNow assume \u03b8 /\u2208 E. We will show this case is impossible by using the method of infinite descent26.\nWe start with that f\u22121 (r) = \u03b8:\u03c6\u03c6 and \u03b8 /\u2208 E. As r \u2208 DR(B), and r = TopRule(B\u2032) (Equation 4.4), there is a B\u2032\u2032 \u2282arg B that concludes \u03b8. Either B\u2032\u2032 is strict or it is not strict. Suppose it is strict, then Prem(B\u2032\u2032) |= \u03b8, so by monotonicity W |= \u03b8 because Prem(B\u2032\u2032) \u2286 W . This means \u03b8 \u2208 E0 \u2286 E \u2013 contradiction. Therefore, B\u2032\u2032 cannot be strict.\nFurthermore, either B\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Args(R) or not. If B\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Args(R), then DR(B\u2032\u2032) \u2286 R, which means \u03b8 \u2208 Ei \u2286 E, where i is the level such that all defaults corresponding to DR(B\u2032\u2032) have been applied (Equation 2.14) \u2013 contradiction. Therefore, B\u2032\u2032 /\u2208 Args(R).\nThis means DR(B\u2032\u2032) 6\u2286 R, which means there is some rule, s \u2208 DR(B\u2032\u2032), such that f\u22121(s) /\u2208 NBD(E). Suppose s = \u03b8 \u2032:\u03c6\u2032\n\u03c6\u2032 . There are two possibilities:\neither \u03b8\u2032 /\u2208 E or \u00ac\u03c6\u2032 \u2208 E. If the latter, then we can construct an argument A\u2032 concluding \u00ac\u03c6\u2032 which defeats B\u2032\u2032 as in the case when \u00ac\u03c6 \u2208 E. If the former, we can argue as in the previous paragraph to get a strictly smaller argument B\u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2282arg B\u2032\u2032 which concludes \u03b8\u2032.\n25This is because -SP is based on the disjoint elitist order, which ranks \u2205 as the greatest element in Pfin (Rd).\n26That is, we argue \u201cbackwards\u201d from a given argument B \u2208 A down to its smallest subarguments (the singletons), and derive a contradiction.\nWe cannot continue this process forever because arguments are well-founded. Eventually, we must stop at a strict subargument of B\u2032\u2032, which gives a contradiction. Therefore, we cannot have the case \u03b8 /\u2208 E. Therefore, this second case is impossible, and the first case means that for every argument B /\u2208 Args(R) there is some A \u2208 Args(R) such that A \u21aa\u2192 B. This proves the first statement of the representation theorem.\n2. Conc(E) = E:\nWe show that Conc(E) \u2286 FL is the prioritised default extension of our LPDT \u3008D, W, \u227a+\u3009. We let E be the prioritised default extension of \u3008D, W, \u227a+\u3009 and show E = Conc(E).\n2.1 Conc(E) \u2286 E:\nWe first show Conc(E) \u2286 E. Let \u03b8 \u2208 Conc(E), which means there is some argument A \u2208 E where Conc(A) = \u03b8. Either A is strict or it is not.\nIf A is strict, then as Prem(A) \u2286W , we must have W |= \u03b8 by monotonicity. Therefore, W \u2208 E0 \u2286 E by Equation 2.13, and hence \u03b8 \u2208 E.\nIf A is not strict, then for some k \u2208 N+, DR(A) := {d1, . . . , dk}. None of these defaults give rise to a conflict because E is a stable extension. Take the smallest i \u2208 N such that sufficiently many corresponding defeasible rules are applied from DR(A) to conclude \u03b8 in Ei+1 from W . Therefore, \u03b8 \u2208 Ei+1 \u2286 E and hence \u03b8 \u2208 E. Therefore, in either case, Conc(E) \u2286 E.\n2.2 E \u2286 Conc(E):\nWe now show E \u2286 Conc(E).

For example, a normatively rational instantiation of ASPIC+ would guarantee that the conclusions of the ultimately justified arguments are consistent. This idea of normative rationality for structured argumentation frameworks have been formalised by [6]. Let E denote the set of justified arguments. The rationality postulates informally state [12, Section 4.2]:\n1. E is subargument-closed.\n2. Conc (E) is closed under strict rules.\n3. Conc (E) is consistent.\n4. Under Rs, the closure under strict rules of Conc (E) is consistent.\nASPIC+ provides sufficient conditions for its instantiations to be rational. They are:\n1.

(5.1)\nThe intuition is that given a finite set of arguments S, we combine all of these arguments into a bigger argument A only by adding strict rules and axiom premises, leaving the fallible information unchanged. The set S must be finite because the requirement is that all arguments in S must be combined into a single argument A. We may use the notation S+ (\u2208 A) instead of A to emphasise that S+ is a strict extension obtained by extending all arguments of the set S.\nNote that given S, S+ may not exist, nor must it be unique if it does exist. In the former case, there may not be suitable strict rules whose antecedents are in Conc(S) such that S+ is well-defined, in the sense that S+ is a single argument. In the latter case, \u2205+ exists when Kn 6= \u2205 but is, by definition, any strict and firm argument (which includes singleton arguments).

If |S| = 1, say S = {A}, then StExt(S) = {A}.\n3. If |S| \u2265 2, then StExt(S) = \u2205 because there are no strict rules to join multiple arguments (or additional axiom premises that may be introduced) in S together into one argument.\nTherefore, when Rs = \u2205, the only case where the strict extension of a set of arguments S is defined is when S is singleton."}, {"heading": "5.3.2 Reasonableness Defined", "text": "Definition 5.1.

The structure preference order over arguments, -SP (Equation 4.17, page 21), satisfies (R1) to (R3) in the definition of reasonableness29.\nProof. We have:\n1. (R1) This follows because \u2205 is the greatest element under the disjoint elitist order.\n2. (R2) This follows for the same reason as (R1).\n3.

This is work in progress and we now provide some special cases.\nCorollary 5.2. If |S| \u2264 2, then -SP is reasonable30.\nProof. Assume for contradiction that -SP is not reasonable, i.e. Equation 5.3 is true.\nIf |S| = 1, then S = {A} (say) so there is a B \u2208 StExt (S \u2212 {A}) = StExt(\u2205) such that B \u227aSP A, so there is a strict (and firm) argument B that is strictly less preferred than A, which contradicts (R2).\n29In fact, this result holds for the disjoint elitist order in general, i.e. with any underlying strict total order <\u2032\u2032. Recall that -SP is just the disjoint elitist order with <SP (Equation 4.16, page 21) as the underlying strict total order.\n30This result holds for the disjoint elitist order more generally.\nIf |S| = 2, then S = {A,B} (say), so there is a C \u2208 StExt ({B}) such that C \u227aSP A, and there is a D \u2208 StExt ({A}) such that D \u227aSP B. But by the contrapositive of (R3) this means A \u227aSP B \u227aSP A, which contradicts irreflexivity.\nTherefore, for the case of |S| \u2264 2, -SP is reasonable.\nLemma 5.3. If Rs = \u2205, then -SP is reasonable31.\nProof. From Lemma 5.1, it is sufficient to show -SP satisfies (R4). Let \u2205 6= S \u2286fin A be arbitrary. We need to show it is not the case that, for any A \u2208 S, there is some B \u2208 StExt (S \u2212 {A}) such that B \u227aSP A. Assume for contradiction that it is true, and let A \u2208 S be arbitrary. We know from Corollary 5.2 (page 34) we need to show this for |S| > 2. But from Example 8 (page 32), in the case of no strict rules, StExt(S \u2212 {A}) = \u2205 for |S| > 2, which means Equation 5.3 is false, therefore (R4) holds.\nLemma 5.4. If \u2205 6= S \u2286fin A is such that for all A, B \u2208 S,\nA 6= B =\u21d2 DR(A) \u2229DR(B) = \u2205 , (5.5)\nthen -SP is reasonable32.\nProof. Clearly DR(S) \u2286fin Rd, because DR(A) \u2286fin Rd for each A \u2208 A and DR(S) is a union of finite sets. Given the strict toset \u3008Rd, <\u2032\u2032\u3009, we also have a finite strict toset \u3008DR(S), <\u2032\u2032\u3009. This has a <\u2032\u2032-least element r0 \u2208 DR(S). By definition, (\u2203A \u2208 S) r0 \u2208 DR(A) (Equation 2.4, page 6). Call the witness to \u2203 A0, say.\nNote that for all other arguments in S distinct from A0, r0 would not be amongst their defeasible rules. Now assume for contradiction (R4) is false, so Equation 5.3 is true. We instantiate \u2200 to A0 and get\n(\u2203B \u2208 StExt (S \u2212 {A0}))B \u227aSP A0 . (5.6)\nLet B0 be the witness to \u2203. From the definition of the disjoint elitist order, B0 \u227aSP A0 means that\n(\u2203x \u2208 DR(B0)\u2212DR(A0)) (\u2200y \u2208 DR(A0)\u2212DR(B0))x <\u2032\u2032 y =\u21d2 (\u2203x \u2208 DR(B0))x <\u2032\u2032 r0 ,\nbecause r0 \u2208 DR(A0) and r0 /\u2208 DR(B0). However, as r0 is the <\u2032\u2032-least element of DR(S), there is no element in DR(B0) that is smaller than r0. Therefore, Equation 5.3 is false and hence (R4) is true.\nNotice that this last result is consistent with Example 9 (page 33). It is still unknown whether -SP is reasonable for general sets S where \u2205 6= S \u2286fin A although we conjecture that it should be given the consistency properties of PDL and that we have shown the representation theorem. This is work in progress.\n31This result holds for the disjoint elitist order more generally. 32This result holds for the disjoint elitist order more generally."}, {"heading": "5.4 Summary", "text": "In this section, we have reviewed the sufficient conditions that an ASPIC+ instantiation needs to satisfy in order to be normatively rational, which formally means that the rationality postulates of [6] are true.

We are currently working on showing how the structure preference order, -SP , is reasonable. We conjecture that it is reasonable, due to the representation theorem."}, {"heading": "6 Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "In this note we have endowed PDL [3] with argumentation semantics using ASPIC+ [12]. We did this by instantiating ASPIC+ to PDL (Section 4, page 16), devising an ASPIC+ preference order that imitates the procedural construction of extensions in PDL (Section 4.2.3, page 20), and proving the conclusions of the justified arguments correspond exactly to the inferences in PDL (Theorem 4.5, page 26) under this preference. As explained in Section 1, endowing PDL with argumentation semantics allows us to perform inferences in PDL dialectically, in the sense that inference in PDL can formally be viewed as a process of exchanging of arguments and counterarguments [11], until the ultimately justified arguments are found, the conclusions of which are exactly what PDL would conclude. This renders the process of inference in PDL more intuitive, and clarifies the reasons for accepting or rejecting a conclusion.\nIt is easy to see how Theorem 4.5 generalises the argumentation semantics of preferred subtheories [12, page 381 Theorem 34]. Informally, a default theory is isomorphic to a PDT \u3008D, \u2205, \u227a\u3009, where D consists of supernormal defaults and \u227a is consistent with how the sets of the default theory are ranked. Given a linearisation \u227a+ \u2287\u227a, the corresponding preferred subtheory \u03a3 is related to the prioritised default extension by E = Th (\u03a3). The set of arguments with premises from \u03a3 is graph-isomorphic to Args (f (NBD(E))), both of which form a stable extension. Similarly, given the stable extension E , Conc (E) is the prioritised default extension by Theorem 4.5, and the conclusions of the defeasible rules that feature in E make up the corresponding preferred subtheory. In future work we will articulate this idea more formally.\nThere are several issues with the approach we have taken. Firstly, it seems that we have lost generality because we have restricted attention to LPDTs (Section 4.1, page 16). We claim that this does not lose generality because extensions in PDL always presuppose a linearisation \u227a+ of \u227a [3], and we have shown that for any such linearisation the correspondence between PDL and its argumentation semantics is exact.\nSecondly, we have not yet shown that the argument preference relation used, -SP , is reasonable, so we have not guaranteed normative rationality from the point of view of ASPIC+. This is work in progress.\nThe importance of proving that -SP is reasonable is that one can use ASPIC+ to generalise PDL by abstracting the concepts developed in this note to other situations, not necessarily motivated by PDL. For example, if -SP is reasonable, then it can be used in a wider range of contexts. Further, ASPIC+ can identify argumentation-based inferences assuming only a partial ordering, unlike in PDL. How can multiple partial orderings be related to multiple stable extensions of PDL without explicitly linearising? Also, do the other Dung semantics33 become relevant? All of this suggests that our argumentative characterisation can be used to generalise PDL, yet if we lift the requirement to linearise, we can no longer guarantee normative rationality, because one can show that the disjoint elitist order is not transitive when the underlying set \u3008Rd, <\u2032\u2032\u3009 is a poset instead of a toset34. Future work will consider how to generalise the requirement that the defeasible rules are totally ordered, how in this case one can obtain all PDL extensions via argumentation, and the significance of other types of Dung semantics.\nLastly, the argumentative characterisation of PDL provides for distributed reasoning in the course of deliberation and persuasion dialogues. For example, BOID agents with PDL representations of mental attitudes can now exchange arguments and counterarguments when deliberating about which goals to select, and consequently which actions to pursue. Future work can investigate the precise advantages the argumentation semantics in PDL have over more traditional approaches in such situations."}, {"heading": "A Properties of the Disjoint Elitist Order", "text": "In this section we prove several statements made in Section 4.2.2 (page 18).\nTheorem A.1.

(A.4) To prove Equation A.4, we need to show one of the disjuncts, i.e. for at least one of 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n1 or 1 \u2264 l \u2264 n4, we show either( n3\u2227\ni=1\nak < ci\n) \u2227  n5\u2227 j=1 ak < ej  or ( n3\u2227 i=1 dl < ci ) \u2227  n5\u2227 j=1 dl < ej  (A.5)\nby establishing all of the conjuncts. Given \u0393 /DEli \u0393 \u2032 /DEli \u0393 \u2032\u2032, we take the conjunction of Equations A.2 and A.3, making (n1 + n6)(n2 + n4) disjuncts, which is equivalent to the following expression: n1\u2228 k=1 ( n2\u2227 i=1 ak < bi ) \u2227  n5\u2227 j=1 ak < ej  \u2228 n6\u2228 l=1 ( n2\u2227 i=1 fl < bi ) \u2227  n5\u2227 j=1 fl < ej\n \u2227\n n2\u2228 k=1 ( n3\u2227 i=1 bk < ci ) \u2227  n6\u2227 j=1 bk < fj  \u2228 n4\u2228 l=1 ( n3\u2227 i=1 dl < ci ) \u2227  n6\u2227 j=1 dl < fj  . As \u2227 and \u2228 bi-distribute, we have four cases:\n1. For some 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n1 and 1 \u2264 k\u2032 \u2264 n2, we have( n2\u2227 i=1 ak < bi ) \u2227  n5\u2227 j=1 ak < ej  \u2227( n3\u2227 i\u2032=1 bk\u2032 < ci\u2032 ) \u2227  n6\u2227 j\u2032=1 bk\u2032 < fj\u2032  . (A.6)\nThis means for some 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n1, we have n5\u2227 j=1 ak < ej  (A.7)\nand from ( n2\u2227 i=1 ak < bi ) \u2227 ( n3\u2227 i\u2032=1 bk\u2032 < ci\u2032 ) , that 1 \u2264 k\u2032 \u2264 n2, and transitivity of <, we infer( n3\u2227 i=1 ak < ci ) . (A.8)\nEquations A.7 and A.8 imply \u0393 /DEli \u0393 \u2032\u2032.\n2. For some 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n1 and 1 \u2264 l \u2264 n4, we have( n2\u2227 i=1 ak < bi ) \u2227  n5\u2227 j=1 ak < ej  \u2227( n3\u2227 i\u2032=1 dl < ci\u2032 ) \u2227  n6\u2227 j\u2032=1 dl < fj\u2032  (A.9)\nThis is the most subtle case of the four, and uses the fact that < is total. The second the third bracketed conjuncts are necessary but not sufficient to lead to \u0393 /DEli \u0393\n\u2032\u2032. Let k0 be the witness to 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n1 and l0 be the witness to 1 \u2264 l0 \u2264 n4. As < is total, either ak0 < dl0 or dl0 < ak0 (remember all elements are distinct).\n\u2022 If ak0 < dl0 then ak0 < ci for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n3. Therefore,( n3\u2227 i=1 ak0 < ci ) .\n\u2022 If dl0 < ak0 then dl0 < ej for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n5. Therefore, n5\u2227 j=1 dl0 < ej  . In either case, \u0393 /DEli \u0393 \u2032\u2032.\n3. For some 1 \u2264 l \u2264 n6 and 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n2, we have( n2\u2227 i=1 fl < bi ) \u2227  n5\u2227 j=1 fl < ej  \u2227( n3\u2227 i\u2032=1 bk < ci\u2032 ) \u2227  n6\u2227 j\u2032=1 bk < fj\u2032  (A.10)\nThe irreflexivity of < and the first and last bracketed conjuncts gives a contradiction when you run over all indices, so this case gives a contradiction.\n4. For some 1 \u2264 l \u2264 n6 and 1 \u2264 l\u2032 \u2264 n4, we have( n2\u2227 i=1 fl < bi ) \u2227  n5\u2227 j=1 fl < ej  \u2227( n3\u2227 i\u2032=1 dl\u2032 < ci\u2032 ) \u2227  n6\u2227 j\u2032=1 dl\u2032 < fj\u2032  (A.11)\nThis case is similar to the first case - we use transitivity to combine the second and last bracketed conjuncts. This infers the second conjunct of Equation A.5, which means \u0393 /DEli \u0393 \u2032\u2032.\nTherefore, in all cases, \u0393 /DEli \u0393 \u2032\u2032. This shows /DEli is transitive when the underlying order < is total. Now let \u0393, \u0393\u2032 \u2208 Pfin(P ) be arbitrary. To show trichotomy, we start by assuming \u0393 6= \u0393\u2032 and show either \u0393/DEli\u0393\u2032 or \u0393\u2032/DEli\u0393. From Equation 4.6 (page 18), we consider the symmetric difference \u0393 \u0393\u2032. The set \u3008\u0393 \u0393\u2032, <\u3009 \u2286 \u3008P, <\u3009 is also a finite strict toset. This means there must exist a <-least element x0 \u2208 \u0393 \u0393\u2032, say. There are two possibilities:\n\u2022 If x0 \u2208 \u0393\u2212 \u0393\u2032, then \u0393 /DEli \u0393\u2032.\n\u2022 If x0 \u2208 \u0393\u2032 \u2212 \u0393, then \u0393\u2032 /DEli \u0393\u2032.\nThis establishes trichotomy - so \u3008Pfin(P ), /DEli\u3009 is a strict toset.\nLemma A.2. If \u3008P, <\u3009 is a strict poset, then /DEli is not necessarily transitive over Pfin(P ).\nProof. We provide the following counterexample: let P = {a0, a1, a2, a3} such that a0 < a2 and a1 < a3 and nothing else. This means a0||a3 and a1||a2. This is a well-defined strict poset. Now let \u0393 := {a0, a1}, \u0393\u2032 := {a1, a2} and \u0393\u2032\u2032 := {a2, a3}. We can illustrate this in Figure A.2.\nClearly, \u0393 /DEli \u0393 \u2032 because a0 < a2, and \u0393 \u2032 /DEli \u0393 \u2032\u2032 because a1 < a3. Now,\n\u0393 6/DEli\u0393\u2032\u2032 \u21d4 (\u2200x \u2208 \u0393\u2212 \u0393\u2032\u2032) (\u2203y \u2208 \u0393\u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u0393)x 6< y \u21d4 (\u2200x \u2208 {a0, a1}) (\u2203y \u2208 {a2, a3}) x 6< y \u21d4 (\u2200x \u2208 {a0, a1}) [x 6< a2 or x 6< a3] \u21d4 [a0 6< a2 or a0 6< a3] and [a1 6< a2 or a1 6< a3] .\nThis is true, because a0 6< a3 and a1 6< a2 are both true. So this is a situation where \u0393 /DEli \u0393 \u2032 /DEli \u0393 \u2032\u2032 and \u0393 6/DEli\u0393\u2032\u2032. Therefore, /DEli is not transitive.\nCorollary A.3. If \u3008P, <\u3009 is a strict toset, then \u2205 is the /DEli-greatest element in \u3008Pfin(P ), /DEli\u3009.\nProof. Assume for contradiction that there is some \u0393 \u2208 Pfin(P ), \u2205/DEli\u0393, which by Equation 4.6 (page 18) is equivalent to (\u2203x \u2208 \u2205) (\u2200y \u2208 \u0393)x < y, which is false due to \u201c(\u2203x \u2208 \u2205)\u201d.\nCorollary A.4. If \u3008P, <\u3009 is a strict finite toset, then P is the /DEli-least element in \u3008Pfin(P ), /DEli\u3009.\nProof. Assume for contradiction that there is some \u0393 \u2208 Pfin(P ), \u0393 /DEli P . As \u0393 \u2286 P , we must have \u0393\u2212 P = \u2205. By Equation 4.6, \u0393 /DEli P is equivalent to (\u2203x \u2208 \u2205) (\u2200y \u2208 \u0393), which is false due to \u201c(\u2203x \u2208 \u2205)\u201d."}, {"heading": "B Characterising Non-Blocked Defaults", "text": "In this section we prove Lemma 4.4 (page 26).
