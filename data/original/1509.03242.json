INTRODUCTION\nMaking decisions based on the environmental context of a robot\u2019s locations requires that we first model the context of the robot observations, which in turn might correspond to various semantic or conceptually higher level entities that compose the world. If we are given an observation model of these entities that compose the world then it is easy to describe a given scene in terms of these entities using this model; likewise, if we are given a labeling of the world in terms of these entities, then it is easy to compute the observation model for each individual entity. The challenge comes from doing these two tasks together, unsupervised, and with no prior information. ROST [1] , a realtime online spatiotemporal topic modeling framework attempt to solve this problem of assigning high level labels to low level streaming observations.\nTopic modeling techniques were originally developed for unsupervised semantic modeling of text documents [2] [3]. These algorithms automatically discover the main themes (topics) that underly these documents, which can then be used to compare these documents based on their semantic content.\nTopic modeling of observation data captured by a mobile robot faces additional challenges compared to topic modeling of a collection of text documents, or images that are mutually independent. \u2022 Robot observations are generally dependent on its lo-\ncation in space and time, and hence the corresponding semantic descriptor must take into account the location of the observed visual words during the refinement, and use it to compute topic priors that are sensitive to changes in time and the location of the robot. \u2022 The topic model must be updated online and in realtime, since the observations are generally made continuously at regular intervals.

Topics in this case model the latent causes that produce these observations. ROST has been used for building semantic maps [4] and for modeling curiosity in a mobile robot, for the purpose of information theoretic exploration [5]. ROST uses Gibbs sampling to continuously refine the topic labels for the observed data. In this paper we present various variants of Gibbs sampling that can be used to keep the topic labels converged under realtime constraints."}, {"heading": "II. PREVIOUS WORK", "text": ""}, {"heading": "A. Topic Modeling of Spatiotemporal Data", "text": "Given images of scenes with multiple objects, topic modeling has been used to discover objects in these images in an unsupervised manner. Bosch et al.

[8] have demonstrated the use of LDA to provide an intermediate representation of images, which was then used to learn an image classifier over multiple categories.\nInstead of modeling the entire image as a document, Spatial LDA (SLDA) [9] models a subset of words, close to each other in an image as a document, resulting in a better encoding of the spatial structure. The assignment of words to documents is not done a priori, but is instead modeled as an additional hidden variable in the generative process.\nGeometric LDA (gLDA) [10] models the LDA topics using words that are augmented with spatial position. Each topic in gLDA can be visualized as a pin-board where the visual words are pinned at their relatively correct positions. A document is assumed to be generated by first sampling a distribution over topics, and then for each word, sampling a topic label from this distribution, along with the transformation from the latent spatial model to the document (image). These transformations are all assumed to be affine, to model the change in viewpoints.\nLDA has been extended to learn a hierarchical representation of image content. Sivic et al.[11] used hierarchical LDA (hLDA) [12] for automatic generation of meaningful object hierarchies. Like LDA, hLDA also models documents as a mixture of topics; however, instead of the flat topics used in LDA, topics in hLDA correspond to a path in a tree. These topics become more specialized as they travel farther down from the root of the tree."}, {"heading": "III. SPATIOTEMPORAL TOPIC MODEL", "text": "An observation word is a discrete observation made by a robot. Given the observation words and their location, we would like to compute the posterior distribution of topics at this location. Let w be the observed word at location x. We assume the following probabilistic model for the observation words:\n1) word distribution for each topic k:\n\u03c6k \u223c Dirichlet(\u03b2),\n2) topic distribution for words at location x :\n\u03b8x \u223c Dirichlet(\u03b1+H(x)),\n3) topic label for w:\nz \u223c Discrete(\u03b8x),\n4) word label: w \u223c Discrete(\u03c6z),\nwhere y \u223c Y implies that random variable y is sampled from distribution Y , z is the topic label for the word observation w, and H(x) is the distribution of topics in the neighborhood of location x.

Topic model \u03a6 = {\u03c6k} is a K \u00d7 V matrix that encodes the global topic description information shared by all locations.\nThe main difference between this generative process and the generative process of words in a text document as proposed by LDA [2], [3] is in step 2. The context of words in LDA is modeled by the topic distribution of the document, which is independent of other documents in the corpora. We relax this assumption and instead propose the context of an observation word to be defined by the topic distribution of its spatiotemporal neighborhood. This is achieved via the use of a kernel. The posterior topic distribution at location x is thus defined as:\n\u03b8x(k) = P(z = k|x) \u221d (\u2211 y K(x\u2212 y)nky ) + \u03b1, (2)\nwhere K(\u00b7) is the kernel, \u03b1 is the Dirichlet prior hyperameter and, nky is the number of times we observed topic k at location y."}, {"heading": "IV.

This is computationally infeasible for any large dataset. For the special case when the kernel is a uniform distribution over a finite region, we can assume a cell decomposition of the world, and approximate the topic distribution around a location by summing over topic distribution of cells in and around the location.\nLet the world be decomposed into C cells, in which each cell c \u2208 C is connected to its neighboring cells G(c) \u2286 C. Let c(x) be the cell that contains points x. In this paper we only experiment with a grid decomposition of the world in which each cell is connected to its six nearest neighbors, 4 spatial and 2 temporal.

REALTIME INFERENCE USING GIBBS SAMPLING", "text": "Given a word observation wi, its location xi, and its neighborhood Gi = G(c(xi)), we use a Gibbs sampler to assign a new topic label to the word, by sampling from the posterior topic distribution:\nP(zi = k|wi = v, xi) \u221d nvk,\u2212i + \u03b2\u2211V\nv=1(n v k,\u2212i + \u03b2)\n\u00b7\nnkGi,\u2212i + \u03b1\u2211K k=1(n k Gi,\u2212i + \u03b1) ,\n(4)\nwhere nwk,\u2212i counts the number of words of type w in topic k, excluding the current word wi, nkGi,\u2212i is the number of words with topic label k in neighborhood Gi, excluding the current word wi, and \u03b1, \u03b2 are the Dirichlet hyper-parameters. Note that for a neighborhood size of 0, the above Gibbs sampler is equivalent to the LDA Gibbs sampler proposed by Griffiths et al.[3], where each cell corresponds to a document. Algorithm 1 shows a simple iterative technique to compute the topic labels for the observed words in batch mode.\nIn the context of robotics we are interested in the online refinement of observation data. After each new observation, we only have a constant amount of time to do topic label refinement. Hence, any online refinement algorithm that has computational complexity which increases with new data, is not useful.

At each time step we add the new observations to the model, and then randomly pick observation times t \u223c P(t|T ), where T is the current time, for which we resample the topic labels and update the topic model.\nWe discuss the choice of P(t|T ) in the following sections."}, {"heading": "A.

This is analogous to o-LDA approach by Banerjee and Basu [13].\nIf R is our computation budget, defined as the expected number of observation time-steps our system can refine between the arrival times of two consecutive observations, and r(t) be the number of times observations in Mt have been refined after time T , then this approach gives each observation R amount of resources.\nE{r(t)} = R (6)\nAlthough this sounds fair, the problem is that no information from the future is used to improve the understanding of the past data."}, {"heading": "B.

(9)\nWe see that older observations are sampled disproportionally higher than newer observations, and topic labels of new observations might take a long time to converge. In fact, if \u03c4R is the expected number of iterations it takes for topic labels of an observation to converge, where \u03c4 < 1 is a constant, then all observations after time t\u2032 = 1/\u03c4 would never be able to converge in the time before the next observation arrives.

Realtime Gibbs Samplers", "text": "To evaluate the proposed realtime Gibbs samplers on real data, we performed the following experiment. For each video dataset, and for each Gibbs sampler, we computed the topic labels and perplexity online, with 10 random restarts. We then compared the mean perplexity of words, one time step after their arrival (instantaneous), and after all observations have been made (final), with the perplexity of topic labels computed in batch. For a fair comparison, we used the same refinement time per time step (TR) for both batch and online cases. The resulting perplexity plots are shown in Figures 3, 4, and 5. The mean perplexity scores for the entire datasets are shown in Tables III (instantaneous perplexity), and II (final perplexity). Note that instantaneous perplexity is computed on a new image, given the model learnt online from all previous data. Hence this perplexity score serves the same purpose as computing perplexity on held out data when evaluating topic modeling on batch data.\nFrom our experiments we find that although Uniform and Age Proportional Gibbs samplers perform well when it comes to final perplexity of the dataset, they however perform poorly when measuring instantaneous perplexity. Low instantaneous perplexity, which is measured one time step after an observation is made, is essential for use of topic modeling in robotic applications. We would like to make decisions based on current observations, and hence low instantaneous perplexity is crucial. We find that the mixed Gibbs samplers such as Uniform+Now perform consistently well.
