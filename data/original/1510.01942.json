We want it to be possible to construct these systems using a formalism that permits a domain expert to do most of the work and immediately deploy the result over the web. To this end, we describe a new platform, \u201cRegulus Lite\u201d, which can be used to develop several different types of spoken language translation application.\nA question immediately arises: are such platforms still relevant, given the existence of Google Translate (GT) and similar engines? We argue the answer is yes, with the clearest evidence perhaps coming from medical speech translation. Recent studies show, unsurprisingly, that GT is starting to be used in hospitals, for the obvious reason that it is vastly cheaper than paid human interpreters [4]; on the other hand, experience shows that GT, which has not been trained for this domain, is seriously unreliable on medical language. A recent paper [23]\n? Medical translation work was supported by Geneva University\u2019s Innogap program. Work on sign language translation was supported by the Cre\u0301dit Suisse, Raiffeisen, TeamCO and Max Bircher Foundations. We thank Nuance Inc. and the University of East Anglia for generously allowing us to use their software for research purposes.\nar X\niv :1\n51 0.\n01 94\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.H C\n] 7\nO ct\n2 01\ndescribes the result of a semi-formal evaluation, in which it was used to translate ten text sentences that a doctor might plausibly say to a patient into 26 target languages. The bottom-line conclusion was that the results were incorrect more than one time in three.\nDoctors are thus with good reason suspicious about the use of broad-coverage speech translation systems in medical contexts, and the existence of systems like MediBabble1 gives further grounds to believe that there is a real problem to solve here. MediBabble builds on extremely unsophisticated translation technology (fixed-phrase, no speech input), but has achieved considerable popularity with medical practitioners. In safety-critical domains like medicine, there certainly seem to be many users who prefer a reliable, unsophisticated system to an unreliable, sophisticated one. MediBabble is a highly regarded app because the content is well-chosen and the translations are known to be good, and the rest is viewed as less important. The app has been constructed by doctors; a language technologist\u2019s reaction is that even if GT may be too unreliable for use in hospitals, one can hope that it is not necessary to go back to architectures quite as basic as this. A reasonable ambition is to search for a compromise which retains the desirable property of producing only reliable output prechecked by professional translators, but at the same time supports at least some kind of productive use of language, and also speech recognition.\nA second type of application which has helped motivate the development of our architecture is speech-to-sign-language translation. Sign languages are lowresource, a problem they share with many of the target languages interesting in the context of medical speech translation. In addition, since they are non-linear, inherently relying on multiple parallel channels of communication including hand movement, eye gaze, head tilt and eyebrow inflection [21], it is not possible to formalise translation as the problem of converting a source-language string into a target-language string. It is in principle feasible to extend the SMT paradigm to cover this type of scenario, but currently available mainstream SMT engines do not do so. As a result, most previous SMT approaches to sign language machine translation, such as [27] and [19], have used unilinear representations of the sign languages involved. If we want to build sign-language translators which can produce high-quality output in the short-term, rule-based systems are a logical choice.\nA third application area where this kind of approach seems appropriate is interactive multilingual questionnaires. Particularly in crisis areas, it is often useful for personnel in the field to be able to carry out quick surveys where information is elicited from subjects who have no language in common with the interviewer [26]. Again, applications of this kind only need simple and rigid coverage, but accurate translation and rapid deployability are essential, and practically interesting target languages are often underresourced.\nIn the rest of the paper, we describe Regulus Lite, showing how it can be used as an economical tool for building spoken language translation applications at least for the three domains we have just mentioned. The main focus is\n1 http://medibabble.com/\napplication content development. \u00a72 gives an overview of the platform and the rule formalism. \u00a73 presents specific details on medical speech translation, sign language translation and voice questionnaires, and briefly sketches the initial applications. \u00a74 presents some initial evaluation results for the voice questionnaire app, currently the most advanced one. The final section concludes."}, {"heading": "2 The platform", "text": "The Regulus Lite platform supports rapid development and web deployment for three types of small to medium vocabulary speech translation applications: plain translation, sign language translation, and voice questionnaires. We briefly describe each of these:\nPlain translation The simplest case: the source language user speaks and the system displays its understanding of what the user said (a paraphrase of what was recognised). If the source language user approves the paraphrase, a target language translation is produced. Sign language translation Similar to plain translation, but the output is rendered in some form of sign language, using a signing avatar. Voice questionnaires The content is organized as a form-filling questionnaire, where the interviewer poses the questions in spoken form, after which they are translated into the target language and presented to the subject. There are typically many possible questions for each field in the questionnaire. The subject responds by pressing one of a question-dependent set of buttons, each of which is labelled with a possible answer.\nA basic assumption is that the content will be in the form of flat phrasal regular expression grammars. Reflecting this, content is specified using two basic constructions, TrPhrase (phrases) and TrLex (lexical items). Each construction combines one or more Source language patterns and at most one Target language result for each relevant target language, and indicates that the Source line can be translated as the Target. A trivial example2 might be\nTrPhrase $$top Source ( hello | hi ) Target/french Bonjour EndTrPhrase\nA slightly more complex example, which includes a TrLex, might be\nTrPhrase $$top Source i ( want | would like ) $$food-or-drink ?please Source ( could | can ) i have $$food-or-drink ?please Target/french je voudrais $$food-or-drink s\u2019il vous pla\u0131\u0302t EndTrPhrase\nTrLex $$food-or-drink source=\"a (coca-cola | coke)\" french=\"un coca\"\n2 The notation has been changed slightly for expositional purposes.\nHere, the variable $$food-or-drink in the first rule indicates a phrase that is to be translated using the second rule.\nIn order to decouple the source language and target language development tasks, TrPhrase and TrLex units are split into pieces placed in separate languagespecific files, one for the source language and one for each target language. The connecting link is provided by a canonical version of the source language text (the portions marked as Target/english or english=). Thus the TrPhrase and TrLex units above will be reconstituted from the source-language (English) pieces\nTrPhrase $$top Source i ( want | would like ) $$food-or-drink ?please Source ( could | can ) i have $$food-or-drink ?please Target/english i want $$food-or-drink please EndTrPhrase\nTrLex $$food-or-drink source=\"a (coca-cola | coke)\" english=\"a coke\"\nand the target language (French) pieces\nTrPhrase $$top Target/english i want $$food-or-drink please Target/french je voudrais $$food-or-drink s\u2019il vous pla\u0131\u0302t EndTrPhrase\nTrLex $$food-or-drink english=\"a coke\" french=\"un coca\"\nThe development process starts with the source language developer writing their piece of each unit, defining the application\u2019s coverage. A script then generates \u201cblank\u201d versions of the target language files, in which the canonical source lines are filled in and the target language lines are left empty; so the French target language developer will receive a file containing items like the following, where their task is to replace the question marks by translating the canonical English sentences.\nTrPhrase $$top Target/english i want $$food-or-drink please Target/french ? EndTrPhrase\nTrLex $$food-or-drink source=\"a coke\" french=\"?\"\nAs the source language developer adds more coverage, the \u201cblank\u201d target language files are periodically updated to include relevant new items.\nThe content can at any time be compiled into various pieces of runtime software, of which the most important are an application-specific grammar-based speech recogniser and a translation grammar; the underlying speech recognition engine used in the implemented version of the platform is Nuance Recognizer\nversion 10.2. These generated software modules can be immediately uploaded to a webserver, so that the system is redeployable on a time scale of a few minutes. Applications can be hosted on mobile platforms \u2014 smartphones, tablets or laptops \u2014 linked over a 3G connection to a remote server, with recognition performed on the server [12]. The deployment-level architecture of the platform is adapted from that of the related platform described in [25], and offers essentially the same functionality."}, {"heading": "3 Types of application", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Medical translation", "text": "As already mentioned, medical speech translation is one of the areas which most strongly motivates our architecture. Several studies, including earlier projects of our own [23,30], suggest that doctors are dubious about the unpredictability of broad-coverage SMT systems and place high value on translations which have been previously validated by professional translators. Other relevant factors are that medical diagnosis dialogues are sterotypical and highly structured, and that the languages which pose practical difficulties are ones badly served by mainstream translation systems.\nThe practical problems arise from the fact that the Lite formalism only supports regular expression translation grammars. The question is thus what constituents we can find which it is safe always to translate compositionally. It is clear that many constituents cannot be treated in this way. Nonetheless, it turns out that enough of them can be translated compositionally that the grammar description is vastly more efficient than a completely enumerative framework; most adjuncts, in particular PPs and subordinate clauses, can be regarded as compositional, and it is often possible to treat nouns and adjectives compositionally in specific contexts.\nWe are currently developing a prototype medical speech translator in a collaboration with a group at Geneva\u2019s largest hospital3. Initial coverage is organised around medical examinations involving abdominal pain, with the rules loosely based on those developed under an earlier project [2]. Translation is from French to Spanish, Italian and Arabic4. A typical source language rule (slightly simplified for presentational purposes) is\nTrPhrase $$top Source ?$$PP_time la douleur est-elle ?$$adv $$qual ?$$PP_time Source ?$$PP_time avez-vous ?$$adv une douleur $$qual Source ?$$PP_time ?(est-ce que) la douleur est ?$$adv $$qual ?$$PP_time Target/french la douleur est-elle ?$$adv $$qual ?$$PP_time EndTrPhrase\n3 Ho\u0302pitaux Universitaires de Gene\u0300ve 4 Tigrinya will be added soon.\nHere, the French Source lines give different variants of la douleur est-elle $$qual (\u201cIs the pain $$qual?\u201d), for various substitutions of the transfer variable $$qual (vive, \u201csharp\u201d; difficile a\u0300 situer, \u201chard to localize\u201d; dans l\u2019angle costal, \u201cin the intercostal angle\u201d, etc). Each variant can optionally be modified by an adverb ($$adv) and/or a temporal PP ($$PP time). Thus the questions covered will be things like avez-vous souvent une douleur vive le matin? (\u201cdo you often experience a sharp pain in the morning?\u201d) As the rule illustrates, there are typically many possible ways of formulating the question, all of which map onto a single canonical version. The target language translators work directly from the canonical version.\nThe current prototype represents the result of about one person-month of effort, nearly all of which was spent on developing the source side rules. Coverage consists of about 250 canonical patterns, expanding to about 3M possible source side sentences; the source language vocabulary is about 650 words. Creating a set of target language rules only involves translating the canonical patterns, and is very quick; for example, the rules for Italian, which were added at a late stage, took a few hours.\nSpeech recognition is anecdotally quite good: sentences which are within coverage are usually recognised, and correctly recognised utterances are always translated correctly. The informal opinion of the medical staff who have taken part in the experiments is that the system is already close to the point where it would be useful in real hospital situations, and clearly outperforms Google Translate within its intended area of application. We are in process of organising a first formal evaluation and expect to be able to report results in 2016."}, {"heading": "3.2 Sign language translation", "text": "The rapidly emerging field of automatic sign language translation poses multiple challenges [3,5,7,9,13,16,17,18,20,22,28]. An immediate problem is that sign languages are very resource-poor. Even for the largest and best-understood sign languages, ASL and Auslan, the difficulty and expense of signed language annotation means there is an acute shortage of available corpus data5; for most of the world\u2019s estimated 120 sign languages [31], there are no corpora at all. In addition, there are often no reliable lexica or grammars and no native speakers of the language with training in linguistics.\nSign languages also pose unique challenges not shared with spoken languages. As already mentioned, they are inherently non-linear; even though the most important component of meaning is conveyed by the hands/arms (the manual activity), movements of the shoulders, head, and face (the non-manual components) are also extremely important and are capable of assuming functions at all linguistic levels [6]. Commonly cited examples include the use of head shakes/eyebrow movements to indicate negation and eye gaze/head tilt to convey topicalization [21,14]. Anecdotally, signers can to some extent understand\n5 The largest parallel corpus used in sign language translation that we know of has about 8 700 utterances [11].\nsigned language which only uses hand movements, but it is regarded as unnatural and can easily degenerate into incomprehensibility [29]; quantitatively, controlled studies show that the absence of non-manual information in synthesized signing (sign language animation) leads to lower comprehension scores and lower subjective ratings of the animations [15]. In summary, it is unsatisfactory to model sign language translation with the approximation most often used in practice: represent a signed utterance as a sequence of \u201cglosses\u201d (identifiers corresponding to hand signs), and consider the translation problem as that of finding a sequence of glosses corresponding to the source language utterance [8]. This approximation is unfortunately necessary if mainstream SMT engines are to be used.\nFor the above reasons and others, it is natural to argue that current technology requires high-quality automatic sign language translation to use rule-based methods in which signed utterances are represented in nonlinear form [13]. Our treatment conforms to these intuitions and adapts them to the minimalistic Lite framework. Following standard practice in the sign language linguistics literature, a signed utterance is represented at the linguistic level as a set of aligned lists, one for each parallel output stream: at the moment, we use six lists respectively called gloss (hand signs), head (head movements like nodding or shaking), gaze (direction of eye gaze), eyebrows (raising or furrowing of eyebrows), aperture (widening or narrowing of eyes) and mouthing (forming of sound-like shapes with the mouth).\nThe examples we show below are taken from our initial application, which translates train service announcements from spoken French to Swiss French sign language. A typical sign table is shown in Figure 1; translation from speech to sign is performed in three stages, with sign tables like these acting as an intermediate representation or pivot. As before, the first stage is to use speech recognition to produce a source language text string6. In the second, the source language string is translated into a sign table. Finally, the sign table is translated into a representation in SiGML [9], which can be fed into a signing avatar; in the current version of the system, we use JASigning [10]. The image below shows the\n6 This is a slight oversimplification; in actual fact, recognition passes an n-best hypothesis list. The complications this introduces are irrelevant in the present context.\nuser interface. On the left, we have, from top to bottom, the recognition result and the sign table; on the right, the avatar, the avatar controls and the SiGML.\nThe issues that are of interest here are concerned with the text to sign table translation stage; once again, the central challenge is to create a formalism which can be used by linguists who are familiar with the conventions of sign language linguistics, but not necessarily with computational concepts. The formalism used is a natural generalization of the one employed for normal text-to-text translation; the difference is that the output is not one list of tokens, but six aligned lists, one for each of the output streams. For practical reasons, since correct alignment of the streams is crucial, it is convenient to write rules in spreadsheets and use the spreadsheet columns to enforce the alignment.\nThe non-obvious aspects arise from the fact that phrasal sign translation rules in general fail to specify values for all the output streams, with the values of the other streams being filled in by phrases higher up in the parse tree. Figure 2 illustrates, continuing the example from the previous figure. The lexical entry for gene\u0300ve only specifies values for the gloss and mouthing lines. When the rules are combined to form the output shown in Figure 1, the value of eyebrows associated with the sign glossed GENEVE is inherited from the phrase above, and thus becomes FurrowBoth.\nThe process by which sign tables are translated into SiGML is tangential to the main focus of this paper, so we content ourselves with a brief summary. The information required to perform the translation is supplied by three lexicon spreadsheets, maintained by the sign language expert, which associate glosses and other identifiers appearing in the sign table with SiGML tags and strings written in HamNoSys [24], a popular notation for describing signs. The rule compiler checks the spreadsheets for missing entries, and if necessary adds new \u201cblank\u201d rows, using a model similar to that described in \u00a72."}, {"heading": "3.3 Voice questionnaires", "text": "We have already touched on the special problems of interactive voice questionnaires in the introduction. The overall intention is to add speech input and output capablities to the RAMP data gathering questionnaire framework [26]. The questionnaire definition encodes a branching sequence of questions, where the identity of the following question is determined by the answer to the preceding one. The display shows the person administering the questionnaire the field currently being filled; they formulate a question and speak it in their own language. In general, there are many questions which can be used to fill a given field, and the interviewer will choose an appropriate one depending on the situation. A basic choice, which affects most fields, is between a WH and a Y/N question. For example, if the interviewer can see recently used cooking utensils in front of him, it is odd to ask the open-ended WH-question \u201cWhere do you do the cooking?\u201d; a more natural choice is to point and ask the Y/N confirmation question \u201cIs cooking done in the house?\u201d\nAs usual, the app performs speech recognition, gives the interviewer confirmation feedback, and speaks the target language translation if they approve. It then displays a question-dependent set of answer icons on the touch-screen. The respondent answers by pressing one of them; each icon has an associated voice recording, in the respondent language, identifying its function. Speech recognition coverage, in general, is limited to the specific words and phrases defined in the application content files. In this particular case, it is advantageous to limit it further by exploiting the tight constraints inherent in the questionnaire task, so that at any given moment only the subset of the coverage relevant to the current question is made available.\nAs far as rule formalisms are concerned, the questionnaire task only requires a small extension of the basic translation framework, in order to add the extra\ninformation associated with the questionnaire structure. The details are straightforward and are described in [1].\nThe next section uses an initial prototype of a voice questionnaire app (\u201cAidSLT\u201d) to perform a simple evaluation of speech recognition performance. The questionnaire used for the evaluation contained 18 fields, which together supported 75 possible translated questions, i.e. an average of about 4 translated questions per field. The recognition grammar permitted a total of 11 604 possible source language questions, i.e. an average of about 155 source language questions per translated question."}, {"heading": "4 Initial evaluation", "text": "The initial AidSLT questionnaire was tested during the period March\u2013July 2015 by seven humanitarian workers with field experience and knowledge of household surveys. The main focus of the evaluation was on the recognition of speech input by English-speaking interviewers. Subjects were presented with a simulation exercise that consisted in administering a household survey about malaria preventive measures to an imaginary French-speaking respondent. Instructions were sent by e-mail in the form of a PDF file. The subjects logged in to the application over the web from a variety of locations using password-protected accounts. Each subject ran the questionnaire once; annotations were added in the script so that several questions produced a popup which asked the subject to rephrase their initial question.\nWe obtained a total of 137 correctly logged interactions7, which were annotated independently by two judges. Annotators were asked to transcribe the recorded utterances and answer two questions for each utterance: a) whether the subject appeared to be reading the heading for the questionnaire field or expressing themselves freely, and b) whether the translation produced adequately expressed the question asked in the context of the questionnaire task. Agreement between the two judges was very good, with a Cohen\u2019s kappa of 0.786 and an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient of 0.922.\nThe bottom-line result was that between 77 and 79 of the sentences were freely expressed (56\u201358%) and only 10 produced incorrect translations (7%), despite a Word Error Rate of about 29%. All the incorrect translations were of course due to incorrect recognition. We find this result encouraging; the architecture appears to be robust to bad recognition and exploits the constrained nature of the task well."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions and further directions", "text": "We have described a platform that supports rapid development of a variety of limited-domain speech translation applications.
