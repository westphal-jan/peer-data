Introduction", "text": "Stochastic optimization has received lots of attention recently in data mining and machine learning communities (Hu et al., 2009; Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2013). It is generally formulated as a minimization problem where the objective is an expectation over unknown distributions (Nemirovski et al., 2009), or defined in terms of the access model, which assumes there is a stochastic oracle that generates unbiased estimate of the objective or its gradient (Hazan and Kale, 2011). Algorithms for stochastic optimization, such as the stochastic gradient descent (SGD), utilize stochastic gradients of the objective for updating. Those methods have lightweight computation per iteration, and are widely used to reduce the time complexity of optimization problems.\nIn this paper, we take a different perspective and exploit stochastic optimization as a tool to reduce the space complexity for certain optimization problem over matrices. Specifically, we study the nuclear norm regularized convex optimization problem\nmin W\u2208W\u2286Rm\u00d7n\nF (W ) = f(W ) + \u03bb\u2016W\u2016\u2217 (1)\nAlgorithm 1 SPGD for nuclear norm regularization Input: The number of trials T , and the regularization parameter \u03bb\n1: Initialize W1 = 0 2: for t = 1, 2, . . . , T do 3: Construct a low-rank stochastic gradient G\u0302t = AtB \u22a4 t of f(\u00b7) at Wt 4: Calculate Wt+1 according to (2) 5: end for 6: return WT+1\nwhere W is the domain of the solution, f(\u00b7) is a convex function, and \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u2217 is the nuclear norm of matrices. Note that the above problem is a special case of convex composite optimization (Nesterov, 2013). Due to the nuclear norm regularizer, the optimal solution W\u2217 to (1) is a low-rank matrix, provided \u03bb is large enough. Here, we consider the large-scale setting: \u201cboth m and n are very large such that directly storing an m\u00d7n matrix in memory is impossible\u201d. This setting excludes deterministic methods for solving (1) (Nesterov, 2013), as they need to evaluate the gradient of f(\u00b7), which needs O(mn) memory. Although various stochastic algorithms has been proposed for convex composite optimization and can also be applied to (1), their primal goal is to reduce the time complexity of evaluating the gradient of f(\u00b7) instead of the space complexity (Lin et al., 2011; Lan, 2012). As a result, most of them still have an O(mn) space requirement.\nThe only memory-efficient algorithm for solving (1) that we found in the literature is a heuristic algorithm developed by Avron et al. (2012). Under the condition that it is possible to generate a stochastic gradient of f(\u00b7) which is also low-rank, they propose to combine SGD and truncated SVD to solve (1). By representing all the intermediate solutions and stochastic gradients in low-rank factorization forms, the space complexity can be reduced to O(m+n). The major limitation of this approach is that there is no theoretical guarantee about its convergence, due to the fact that the truncated SVD operation introduces a constant error in each iteration. Furthermore, when the objective value is difficult to calculate, it is also unclear which iterate should be used as the final solution.\nInspired by the previous studies, we develop a novel stochastic algorithm that optimizes (1) in a memory-efficient way and is supported by formal theoretical guarantees. Specifically, we propose to use stochastic proximal gradient descent (SPGD) instead of SGD to solve (1), and take the last iterate of SPGD as the final solution. Similar to the heuristic algorithm of Avron et al. (2012), the proposed algorithm always maintains a low-rank factorization of iterates that can be conveniently held in memory, and both the time and space complexities in each iteration are O(m+n). Built upon recent progresses in stochastic optimization (Rakhlin et al., 2012; Shamir and Zhang, 2012), we further analyze the convergence property of the proposed algorithm, and show that the last iterate has an O(log T/ \u221a T ) convergence rate for general convex functions, and an O(log T/T ) rate for strongly convex functions.\n2. The Algorithm\nOur algorithm is based on the following observation. For any W \u2208 W, it is always possible to generate a low-rank matrix G\u0302 represented as AB\u22a4 such that\nE[G\u0302] = E[AB\u22a4] \u2208 \u2202f(W )\nand A and B occupy O(m) and O(n) memory, respectively. The existence and construction of such a low-rank matrix can be found in previous studies (Avron et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2014), and will be discussed later.\nDenote by Wt the solution at the t-th iteration, and let G\u0302t = AtB \u22a4 t be the low-rank stochastic gradient of f(\u00b7) at Wt. Then, we update the current solution by the SPGD, which is a stochastic variant of composite gradient mapping Nesterov (2013)\nWt+1\n=argmin W\u2208W\n1 2 \u2016W \u2212Wt\u20162F + \u03b7t\u3008W \u2212Wt, G\u0302t\u3009+ \u03b7t\u03bb\u2016W\u2016\u2217\n=argmin W\u2208W\n1\n2\n\u2225\u2225\u2225W \u2212 ( Wt \u2212 \u03b7tG\u0302t )\u2225\u2225\u2225 2\nF + \u03b7t\u03bb\u2016W\u2016\u2217\n(2)\nwhere \u03b7t > 0 is the step size. Due to the presence of the nuclear norm regularizer, all the iterates Wt\u2019s tend to be low-rank matrices. The fact that both Wt and G\u0302t are low-rank matrices can in turn be exploited to accelerate the updating.\nIn the beginning, we simply set W1 be the zero matrix, and take the last iterate WT+1 as the final solution. The complete procedure is summarized in Algorithm 1."}, {"heading": "2.1 Construction of the Low-rank Stochastic Gradients", "text": "For a given matrix W , there are various ways to construct a low-rank stochastic gradient G\u0302 satisfying E[G\u0302] \u2208 \u2202f(W ) (Avron et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2014). For brevity, we just describe a general approach. To this end, we need the following definition from Avron et al. (2012).\nDefinition 1 (Probing Matrix) A random n\u00d7k matrix Y is a probing matrix if E[Y Y \u22a4] = I.\nAvron et al. (2012) also provide several families of distributions that generate probing matrices efficiently. Lemma 2 Let Y = Z/ \u221a k where Z is a random matrix drawn any one of the following distributions:\n1. Independent entries taking values +1 and \u22121 with equal probability 1/2.\n2. Independent and identically distributed standard normal entries.\n3. Each column of Z is drawn uniformly at random and independent of each other from {\u221ane1, . . . , \u221a ne2} (scaled identity vectors).\nThen, Y is a probing matrix.\nLet G is a subgradient of f(\u00b7) at X, i.e., G \u2208 \u2202f(X). Then, we can construct G\u0302 as\nG\u0302 = AB\u22a4, A = GY, and B = Y.\nThus, as long as we can evaluate the subgradient of f(\u00b7), we can construct a low-rank stochastic gradient. Note that when Y is constructed from the scaled identity vectors, A = GY are scaled columns of G. So, in this case, we only need to compute a small portion of G, which could be very efficient."}, {"heading": "2.2 Efficient Implementation of the Updating", "text": "During the optimization process, all the iterates Wt are represented in the SVD form Wt = U\u22a4t \u03a3tV \u22a4 t , which needs O((m+n)rt) memory.

Then, by exploiting the fact that G\u0302t = AtB \u22a4 t is also represent in a low-rank factorization form, we can implement the updating rule in (2) efficiently when W = Rm\u00d7n or W = {W |W \u2208 Rm\u00d7n, \u2016W\u2016F \u2264 R}.

Compared to previous studies, there are two advantages of the proposed algorithm: i) it space complexity is O(m + n) instead of O(mn) and ii) it is equipped with a formal convergence rate.\nThe space complexity of our algorithm also depends on the rank of the intermediate iterates Wt. AlthoughWt tends to be a low-rank matrix due to the nuclear norm regularizer, an explicit upper bound about its rank is unknown. This issue will be studied as a future work.

By representing all the intermediate solutions and stochastic gradients in low-rank factorization forms, the space complexity can be reduced to O(m+n). The major limitation of this approach is that there is no theoretical guarantee about its convergence, due to the fact that the truncated SVD operation introduces a constant error in each iteration. Furthermore, when the objective value is difficult to calculate, it is also unclear which iterate should be used as the final solution. Inspired by the previous studies, we develop a novel stochastic algorithm that optimizes (1) in a memory-efficient way and is supported by formal theoretical guarantees.
