INTRODUCTION", "text": "For decades semantic analysis of textual content has gained enormous attention within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community as a means for automating language understanding. To this end, evaluating lexical semantic similarity/relatedness has attracted many researchers as an enabler mechanism for many text understanding tasks. Semantic relatedness is a knowledge intensive task\nas it requires huge amount of world knowledge to accomplish its goal [Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011].\nAlthough semantic similarity and relatedness are often used interchangeably in the literature, they do not represent the same task [Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006]. Evaluating genuine similarity is, and should be, concerned with measuring the similarity or resemblance in meanings and hence focuses on the synonymy relations (e.g., smart,intelligent). Relatedness, on the other hand, is more general and covers broader scope as it focuses on other relations such as antonymy (old,new), hypernymy (cock,bird), and other functional associations (money,bank).\nSemantic relatedness has many applications in NLP and Information Retrieval (IR) for addressing problems such as word sense disambiguation, paraphrasing, text categorization, dimensionality reduction, and others. Most semantic relatedness methods are inspired by the distributional hypothesis [Harris, 1954] which emphasizes the idea that similar words tend to appear in similar contexts and thus have similar contextual distributions. Those methods often develop a distributional semantics model which represents each linguistic term as a vector derived from contextual information of that term in a large corpus of text or knowledge base. [Baroni et al., 2014, Turney et al., 2010, Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011, Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007, Landauer et al., 1997]. After constructing such distributional vectors, relatedness is calculated using an appropriate vector similarity measure (e.g., cosine similarity).\nIn this paper we propose Mined Semantic Analysis (MSA), a novel concept space model for semantic analysis using unsupervised data mining techniques. MSA represents textual structures (terms, phrases, documents) as a bag-of-concepts. Unlike other concept space models which look for direct associations between concepts and terms through statistical co-occurrence [Camacho-Collados et al., 2015, Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011, Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007], MSA discovers implicit concept-concept associations using rule mining [Agrawal et al., 1993]. MSA uses these associations subsequently to enrich term\u2019s concept space with latent concepts.\nMSA utilizes a search index created using concept rich corpora (e.g., Wikipedia). The concept space of a given term is constructed through two phases. First, an initial set of candidate concepts is retrieved from the index. Second, the candidates set is augmented with other related concepts using discovered concept-concept association rules. Following this strategy, MSA identifies not only concepts directly related to a given text but also other latent concepts associated implicitly with them.\nar X\niv :1\n51 2.\n03 46\n5v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\nO ct\n2 01\n6\nThe contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we introduce a novel concept space model for semantic analysis which augments explicit semantics with conceptual associations through data mining techniques.

Third, we present the first analytical study to examine statistical significance of results reported by different semantic relatedness methods. Our study shows that, the nuances of results across top performing methods could be statistically insignificant. The study positions MSA as one of state-of-the-art methods for measuring semantic relatedness."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "Several semantic representation models have been proposed in the literature. Some of them utilize textual corpora from which world knowledge is acquired and used to represent textual structures as high-dimensional \"meaning\" vectors. As pointed out by [Baroni et al., 2014], those vectors are either estimated by means of statistical modeling such as LSA [Landauer et al., 1997] and LDA [Blei et al., 2003], or more recently through neural network based representations such as CW [Collobert and Weston, 2008], Word2Vec [Mikolov et al., 2013], and GloVe [Pennington et al., 2014].\nKnowledge-based models were also proposed for measuring semantic relatedness [Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2004,Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006, Zesch et al., 2008, Pilehvar and Navigli, 2015]. Those models utilize dictionaries such as Wordnet [Fellbaum, 1998] and Wiktionary, and use explicit word relations to infer semantic relatedness. Hybrid models which incorporate knowledge from corpora and dictionaries were also used to evaluate semantic relatedness [Agirre et al., 2009, Banjade et al., 2015, Camacho-Collados et al., 2015].\nExplicit concept space models such as ESA [Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007], SSA [Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011], and NASARI [CamachoCollados et al., 2015] construct bag-of-concepts (BOC) vectors to represent textual structures using concepts in encyclopedic knowledge source such as Wikipedia. Those BOC embeddings capture the main topics of the given text and therefore are useful for under-\nstanding its semantics.\nThe BOC representations have proven efficacy for semantic analysis of textual data especially short texts where contextual information is missing or insufficient. For example, measuring lexical semantic similarity/relatedness [Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007], text categorization [Song and Roth, 2014], search and relevancy ranking [Egozi et al., 2011], and others. Semantic relatedness models typically employ those semantic vectors to measure relatedness using appropriate similarity measure between the vectors.\nA closely related method to MSA is Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) [Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007]. ESA constructs the concept space of a term by searching an inverted index of termconcept co-occurrences. ESA is mostly the traditional vector space model applied to Wikipedia articles. ESA is effective in retrieving concepts which explicitly mention the target search terms in their content. However, it fails to identify other latent concepts which do not contain the search terms. MSA bridges this gap by mining for concept-concept associations and thus augmenting the concept space identified by ESA with more relevant concepts.\nSalient Semantic Analysis (SSA) was proposed by [Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011] and uses Wikipedia concepts to build semantic profiles of words. SSA is more conservative than ESA as it defines word meaning by its immediate context and therefore might yield concepts of higher relevancy. However, it is still limited to surface semantic analysis because it, like ESA, utilizes only direct associations between words and concepts and fails to capture other latent concepts not directly co-occurring with corpus words in the same context.\n[Radinsky et al., 2011] proposed Temporal Semantic Analysis (TSA) which works by extending ESA\u2019s concept space to include temporal usage patterns of discovered concepts. Both MSA and TSA share a common goal; they try to complement the concept space with information that uncovers implicit concept associations. However, they follow totally different methodologies for achieving that goal. TSA exploits temporal dynamics of concept usage, while MSA ex-\nploits mining the semantic space of each concept as expressed in its associations with other concepts.\nAnother closely related model is Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) [Deerwester et al., 1990, Landauer et al., 1997]. LSA is a statistical model that was originally proposed to solve the vocabulary mismatch problem in information retrieval. LSA first builds a termdocument co-occurrence matrix from textual corpus and then maps that matrix into a new space using singular-value decomposition. In that semantic space terms and documents that have similar meaning will be placed close to one another. Though its effectiveness, LSA has been known to be hard to explain because it is difficult to map the computed space dimensions into meaningful concepts. MSA, alternatively, generates explicit conceptual mappings that are interpretable by humans making it more intuitive than LSA."}, {"heading": "3. MINED SEMANTIC ANALYSIS", "text": "We call our approach Mined Semantic Analysis (MSA) as it utilizes data mining techniques in order to discover the concept space of textual structures. The motivation behind our approach is to mitigate a notable gap in prior concept space models which are limited to direct associations between words and concepts. Therefore those models lack the ability to transfer the association relation to other latent concepts which contribute to the meaning of these words.\nFigure 1 shows MSA\u2019s architecture. In a nutshell, MSA generates the concept space of a given text by utilizing two repositories created offline: 1) a search index of Wikipedia articles, and 2) a concept-concept associations repository created by mining the \"See also\" link graph of Wikipedia concepts (articles). First, the explicit concept space is constructed by retrieving concepts (titles of articles) explicitly mentioning the given text. Second, latent concepts associated with each of the explicit concepts are retrieved from the associations repository and used to augment the concept space.\nTo demonstrate our approach, we provide an example of exploring the concept space of \"Computational Linguistics\" (Table 1). Column 1 shows the explicit concepts retrieved by searching Wikipedia1. Column 2 shows the same explicit concepts in column 1 enriched by implicit concepts. As we can notice, those implicit concepts could augment the explicit concept space by more related concepts which contribute to understanding \"Computational Linguistics\". It is worth mentioning that not all implicit concepts are equally relevant, therefore we also propose an automated mechanism for ranking those concepts in a way that reflects their relatedness to the original search term.\n1We search Wikipedia using a term-concept inverted index and limit the search space to articles with min. length of 2k and max. title length of 3 words."}, {"heading": "3.1 The Search Index", "text": "MSA starts constructing the concept space of term(s) by searching for an initial set of candidate explicit concepts. For this purpose, we build a search index of a concept rich corpus such as Wikipedia where each article represents a concept. This is similar to the idea of the inverted index introduced in ESA [Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007]. We build the index using Apache Lucene2, an open-source indexing and search engine. For each article we index the title, content, length, and the \"See also\" section.\nDuring search we use some parameters to tune the search space. Specifically, we define the following parameters to provide more control over search:\nArticle Length (L): minimum length of Wikipedia article in characters excluding sections like \"References\", \"See also\", \"Categories\", ...etc.\nNumber of Concepts (M): maximum number of concepts (articles) to retrieve as initial candidate concepts.\nTitle Length (\u03c4 ): this threshold is important for pruning all articles that have long irrelevant titles. It represents the maximum number of words in the title, for example, if \u03c4=3, then all articles with more than three words in title will be pruned."}, {"heading": "3.2 Association Rules Mining", "text": "In order to discover the implicit concepts, we employ rule mining [Agrawal et al., 1993] to learn implicit relations between concepts using Wikipedia\u2019s \"See also\" link graph.\nFormally, given a set of concepts C = {c1, c2, ..., cN} of size N (i.e., all Wikipedia articles). We build a dictionary of transactions T = {t1, t2, t3, ..., tM} of size M such that M \u2264 N . Each transaction t in T contains a subset of concepts in C. t is constructed from each article in Wikipedia that contains at least one entry in its \"See also\" section. For example, if an article representing concept c1 with entries in its \"See also\" section referring to concepts {c2, c3, ..., cn}, a transaction t = {c1, c2, c3, ..., cn} will be constructed and added to T. A set of rules R is then created by mining T. Each rule r in R is defined as in equation 1:\nr(s, f) = {(X \u21d2 Y ) : X,Y \u2286C and X\u2229Y =\u2205} (1)\nBoth X and Y are subsets of concepts in C. X are called the antecedents of r and Y are called the consequences. Rule r is parameterized by two parameters: 1) Support (s) which indicates how many times both X and Y appeared together in T, and 2) Confidence (f ) which is s divided by number of times X appeared in T.\nAfter learning R, we end up having concept(s)-concept(s) associations. Using such rules, we can determine the strength of those associations based on s and f.\nAs the number of rules grows exponentially with the number of concepts, we define the following parameters to provide more fine grained control on participating rules during explicit concept expansion:\nConsequences Size (|Y |): number of concepts in rule consequences (right hand side).\n2http://lucene.apache.org/core/\nMinimum Support ( ): minimum rule support. It defines the minimum strength of the association between rule concepts. For example, if =2, then all rules whose support s >= 2 will be considered during concept expansion.\nMinimum Confidence (\u03c5): this threshold defines the minimum strength of the association between rule concepts compared to other rules with same antecedents. For example, if \u03c5=0.5, then all rules whose confidence f >= 0.5 will be considered during concept expansion. In other words, consequent concept(s) must have appeared in at least 50% of the times antecedent concept(s) appeared in T."}, {"heading": "3.3 Constructing the Concept Space", "text": "Given a set of concepts C of size N, MSA constructs the bag-ofconcepts vector Ct of term(s) t through two phases: Search and Expansion. In the search phase, t is represented as a search query and is searched for in the Wikipedia search index. This returns a weighted set of articles that best matches t based on the vector space model. We call the set of concepts representing those articles Cs and is represented as in equation 2:\nCs = {(ci, wi) : ci \u2208 C and i <= N} subject to :\n|title(ci)| <= \u03c4, length(ci) >= L, |Cs| <= M (2)\nNote that we search all articles whose content length and title ngrams meet the thresholds L and \u03c4 respectively. The weight of ci is denoted by wi and represents the match score between t and ci as returned by the search engine.\nIn the expansion phase, we use inferred association rules to expand each concept c in Cs by looking for its associated set of concepts in R. Formally, the expansion set of concepts Cp is obtained as in equation 3:\nCp = \u22c3\nc\u2208Cs,c\u2032\u2208C\n{(c\u2032, w) : \u2203r(s, f)=c\u21d2c\u2032}\nsubject to : |c\u2032| = |Y |, s >= , f >= \u03c5 (3)\nNote that we add all the concepts that are implied by c where this implication meets the support and confidence thresholds ( , \u03c5) respectively. The weight of c\u2032 is denoted by w; currently we use simple weight propagation mechanism where all concepts implied by c inherit the same weight as c.\nFinally, all the concepts from search and expansion phases are merged to construct the concept vector Ct of term(s) t as in equation 4:\nCt = Cs \u222a Cp (4)"}, {"heading": "3.4 Relatedness Scoring", "text": "In order to calculate the relatedness score between a term pair (t1,t2), we first sparsify their concept vectors (Ct1 ,Ct2 ) to have same length.

Wt2 ||Wt1 || ||Wt2 ||\n(5)\nSimilar to [Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011], we include a normalization factor \u03bb as the cosine measure gives low scores for highly related terms due to their concept vectors sparsity. Other approaches for dealing with vector sparsity worth exploring in the future [Song\nand Roth, 2015]. Using \u03bb, the final relatedness score will be adjusted as in equation 6:\nRel(t1, t2) = { 1 Relcos(t1, t2) \u2265 \u03bb Relcos(t1,t2)\n\u03bb Relcos(t1, t2) < \u03bb\n(6)"}, {"heading": "4.

This pattern is common among MSA and all prior techniques which report on these data sets."}, {"heading": "5. A STUDY ON STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE", "text": "Through the results section, we kept away from declaring stateof-the-art method. That was due two facts. First, the differences between reported correlation scores were very small. Second, the size of the data sets was not that large to accommodate for such small differences. These two facts raise a question about the statistical significance of improvement reported by some method A compared to another well performing method B.\nWe hypothesize that the best method is not necessarily the one that gives the highest correlation score. In other words, being state-ofthe-art does not require giving the highest correlation, rather giving a relatively high score that makes any other higher score statistically insignificant.\nTo test our hypothesis, we decided to perform statistical significance tests on the top reported correlations. Initially we targeted Word2Vec, GloVe, ADW, and NASARI besides MSA. We contacted several authors and some of them thankfully provided us with pairwise relatedness scores on corresponding benchmark data sets. We also utilized the publicly available semantic vectors of some models like [Baroni et al., 2014] predict vectors.\nTo measure statistical significance, we performed Steiger\u2019s Z significance test [Steiger, 1980]. The purpose of this test is to evaluate whether the difference between two dependent correlations obtained from the same sample is statistically significant or not, i.e., whether the two correlations are statistically equivalent.\nSteiger\u2019s Z test requires to calculate the correlation between the two\ncorrelations. We applied the tests using reported Spearman correlations (\u03c1) as it is more commonly used than Pearson (r) correlation. We conducted the tests using correlation scores of MSA\u2019s tuned model on WS data set, Word2Vec, ADW, and NSASRI.\nTable 5, shows the results using 1-tailed test with significance level 0.05. For each data set, we report method-method Spearman correlation (\u03c1) calculated using reported scores in Table 3 and Table 4. We report p-value of the test as well.\nOn MC data set, the difference between MSA score and all other methods was statistically insignificant. Only ADW score was statistically significant compared to NSASARI. This implies that MSA can be considered statistically a top performer on MC data set.\nOn RG data set, MSA gave significant improvement over NASARI. ADW score was significantly better than Word2Vec, NASARI, and MSA. Overall, ADW can be considered the best on RG data set followed by MSA and Word2Vec (their \u03c1 scores are 0.92, 0.86, and 0.84 respectively).\nOn WSS, though MSA achieved the highest score (\u03c1=0.77), no significant improvement was proved. Therefore, the differences between the four methods can be considered statistically insignificant.\nOn WSR, WS, and MEN data sets, we could obtain pairwise relatedness scores of Word2Vec only. The significance test results indicated that, the improvement of MSA over Word2Vec on WS was statistically insignificant (their \u03c1 scores are 0.77 and 0.76 respectively). On the other hand, MSA was statistically better than Word2Vec on WSR data set (their \u03c1 scores are 0.71 and 0.64 respectively), while Word2Vec was statistically better than MSA on MEN data set (their \u03c1 scores are 0.79 and 0.75 respectively).\nThis comparative study is one of the main contributions of this paper. To our knowledge, this is the first study that addresses evaluating the statistical significance of results across various semantic relatedness methods. Additionally, this study positioned MSA as one of state-of-the-art methods for measuring semantic relatedness."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we presented MSA, a novel approach for semantic analysis which employs data mining techniques to create conceptual vector representations of text. MSA is motivated by inability of prior concept space models to capture implicit relations between\nconcepts. To this end, MSA mines for implicit concept-concept associations through Wikipedia\u2019s \"See also\" link graph.\nIntuitively, \"See also\" links represent related concepts that might complement the conceptual knowledge about a given concept. Furthermore, it is common in most online encyclopedic portals to have a \"See also\" or \"Related Entries\" sections opening the door for more conceptual knowledge augmentation using these resources in the future.\nThrough empirical results, we demonstrated MSA\u2019s effectiveness to measure lexical semantic relatedness on benchmark data sets. In absolute figures, MSA could consistently produce higher Pearson correlation scores than other explicit concept space models such as ESA, SSA on all data sets. Additionally, MSA could produce higher scores than ADW and NASARI on four out of five data sets. On another hand, MSA scores were higher than predictive models built using neural networks, e.g., Word2Vec.\nRegarding Spearman correlation, MSA produced the highest correlations on two data sets (WSS and WSR). Results on other data sets were very competitive in absolute figures. Specifically, MSA gave higher Spearman correlations than GloVe and Word2Vec on both MC and RG data sets. Additionally, MSA gave higher correlation score on MEN data set than Skipgram, CW, and GloVe neural network based representations.\nThe results show competitive performance of MSA compared to state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, our method produced higher correlation scores than prior explicit semantics methods such as ESA and SSA. The good performance demonstrates the potential of MSA for augmenting the explicit concept space by other semantically related concepts which contribute to understanding the semantics of the given text.\nIn this paper, we introduced the first comparative study which evaluates the statistical significance of results from across top performing semantic relatedness methods. We used Steiger\u2019s Z significance test to evaluate whether reported correlations from two different methods are statistically equivalent even if they are numerically different. We believe this study will help the research community to better evaluate and position state-of-the-art techniques at different application areas. The study proved that, statistically, MSA results are either better than or equivalent to state-of-the-art methods on all data sets except RG where ADW was better, and MEN where Word2Vec was better.\nMSA is a general purpose semantic analysis approach which builds explicit conceptual representations of textual structures. MSA\u2019s concept vectors can be easily interpreted by humans. Therefore, MSA could be leveraged in many text understanding applications such as semantic search, textual entailment, word sense disambiguation, resolving vocabulary mismatch, concept tracking, technology mappings, and others.\nMSA is an efficient technique because it employs an inverted search index to retrieve semantically related concepts to a given text. Additionally, mining for concept(s)-concept(s) association rules is done offline making it scalable to huge amounts of data."}, {"heading": "7.

MSA represents textual structures (terms, phrases, documents) as a bag-of-concepts where concepts are derived from concept rich encyclopedic corpora. Traditional concept space models exploit only target corpus content to construct the concept space. MSA, alternatively, uncovers implicit relations between concepts by mining for their associations (e.g., mining Wikipedia\u2019s \"See also\" link graph). We evaluate MSA\u2019s performance on benchmark data sets for measuring lexical semantic relatedness. Empirical results show competitive performance of MSA compared to prior stateof-the-art methods. Additionally, we introduce the first analytical study to examine statistical significance of results reported by different semantic relatedness methods. Our study shows that, the nuances of results across top performing methods could be statistically insignificant. The study positions MSA as one of state-of-theart methods for measuring semantic relatedness.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
