INTRODUCTION", "text": "The spectro-temporal evolution of harmonic sounds conveys essential information to audio classification, blind source separation, transcription, as well as other processing tasks. This information is however difficult to capture in time-varying, polyphonic mixtures. On one hand, spectrogram-based pattern recognition algorithms [1] are exposed to detection errors as they enforce strong constraints on the shape of harmonic templates. On the other, time-varying generalizations of matrix factorization [2] are underconstrained and thus may fail to converge to a satisfying solution. In this article, we address the characterization of harmonic structures without any detection nor training step.\nWavelets have long proven to provide meaningful, sparse activations as long as they operate on a dimension on which the signal has already some regularity. Although a single sine wave draws a regular edge on the time-frequency plane, a harmonic comb is made of distant sharp peaks over the log-frequency axis, an irregular pattern that is hard to characterize globally. This irregularity weakens the discriminative power of existing wavelet-like representations, such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC).\nTo recover regularity across partials within a wavelet framework, we capitalize on the fact that power-of-two harmonics are exactly one octave apart. By rolling up the log-frequency axis into a spiral, such that octave intervals correspond to full turns, these partials get aligned on a radius. Consequently, introducing the integer-valued octave variable reveals harmonic regularity that was not explicit in the plane of time and log-frequency.\nOnce specified the variables of time, log-frequency, and octave index, our representation merely consists in cascading three wavelet decompositions along them and applying complex modulus. Thus, the constant-Q scalogram is \"scattered\" into channels over which main factors of time variability are disentangled and regularized, yet harmonicity is preserved.\n\u2217 This work is supported by the ERC InvariantClass 320959.

Dilations of this wavelet define a family of bandpass filters centered at frequencies \u03bb1 = 2 j1+ \u03c71 Q , where the indices j1 \u2208 Z and \u03c71 \u2208 {1 . . .

We denote convolutions along time by the operator t\u2217. Applying complex modulus to all wavelet convolutions results in the \"scalogram\" matrix\nx1(t, log \u03bb1) = |x t\u2217 \u03c8\u03bb1 | for all \u03bb1 > 0, (2)\nwhose frequential axis is uniformly sampled by the binary logarithm log \u03bb1. The scalogram x1 localizes the energy of x(t) around frequencies \u03bb1 over durations 2Q/\u03bb1, trading frequency resolution for time resolution.\nThe constant-Q transform (CQT) S1x corresponds to a lowpass filtering of x1 with a window \u03c6T (t) of size T :\nS1x(t, log \u03bb1) = x1 t\u2217 \u03c6T = |x t\u2217 \u03c8\u03bb1 | t\u2217 \u03c6T . (3)\nTo recover the amplitude modulations lost when averaging by \u03c6T in Equation (3), the time scattering transform also convolves x1 with a second filterbank of wavelets \u03c8\u03bb2 and applies complex modulus to get\nx2(t, log \u03bb1, log \u03bb2) = |x1 t\u2217 \u03c8\u03bb2 | = ||x t\u2217 \u03c8\u03bb1 | t\u2217 \u03c8\u03bb2 |. (4)\nThe wavelets \u03c8\u03bb2(t) have a quality factor in the range 1\u20132, though we choose to keep the same notation \u03c8 for simplicity. Like in Equation (3), averaging in time creates invariance to translation in time up to T , yielding\nS2x(t, log \u03bb1, log \u03bb2) = x2 t\u2217 \u03c6T = ||x t\u2217 \u03c8\u03bb1 | t\u2217 \u03c8\u03bb2 | t\u2217 \u03c6T . (5)\nDue to the constant-Q property, S1x and S2x are stable to small time warps of x(t) as long as they do not exceed Q\u22121, i.e. one semitone. This implies that small modulations, such as tremolo and vibrato, are accurately linearized [3]."}, {"heading": "2.2. Joint time-frequency scattering", "text": "The time scattering transform defined in Equation (4) decomposes each frequency band separately, and thus cannot properly capture the coherence of time-frequency structures, such as those induced by pitch contour. To remedy this, And\u00e9n et al. [4] have redefined the wavelets \u03c8\u03bb2 \u2019s as functions of both time and log-frequency, indexed by pairs \u03bb2 = (\u03b1, \u03b2), where \u03b1 is a modulation frequency in Hertz and \u03b2 is a frequency along log-frequencies in cycles per octaves. The joint wavelets \u03c8\u03bb2(t, log \u03bb1) factorize as\n\u03c8\u03bb2(t, log \u03bb1) = \u03c8\u03b1(t)\u00d7 \u03c8\u03b2(log \u03bb1). (6)\nWe write \u03c71\u2217 to denote convolutions along the log-frequency axis, i.e. along chromas. Wavelet scattering is extended to twodimensional convolutions by plugging Equation (6) into the definition of x2 in Equation (4):\nx2(t, log \u03bb1, log \u03bb2) = |x1 t,\u03c71\u2217 \u03c8\u03bb2 | = |x1 t\u2217 \u03c8\u03b1 \u03c71\u2217 \u03c8\u03b2 |. (7)\nThe joint time-frequency scattering transform corresponds to the \"cortical transform\" introduced by Shamma and his team to formalize his findings in auditory neuroscience [10]."}, {"heading": "2.3. Spiral scattering", "text": "The time-frequency scattering transform defined in Equation (7) provides template-free features for pitch variability along time. However, it is unaware of the harmonic structure of voiced sounds, such as vowels or musical notes. The multiscale evolution of this structure yields relevant information about attack transients and formantic changes, almost independently from the pitch contour.\nIn order to capture this information, we extend the joint timefrequency scattering transform to encompass regularity in time across octaves at fixed chroma, in conjunction with regularity along neighboring constant-Q bands. Just like wavelet filterbanks along time and log-frequency have been defined in the two previous subsections, we capitalize on harmonicity by introducing a third wavelet filterbank.\nWe roll up the log-frequency variable log \u03bb1 into a pitch spiral making one full turn at each octave (see Figure 1). Since a frequency interval of one octave corresponds to one unit in binary logarithms log \u03bb1, pitch height and pitch chroma in the spiral correspond to integer part blog \u03bb1c and fractional part {log \u03bb1}:\nlog \u03bb1 = blog \u03bb1c+ {log \u03bb1} = j1 + \u03c71 Q . (8)\nIn this setting, the fundamental frequency f0 is aligned with its power-of-two harmonics 2f0, 4f0, 8f0 and so forth. Likewise, the perfect fifth 3f0 is aligned with 6f0. As the number of harmonics per octave increase exponentially, the alignment of upper harmonics \u2014 5f0, 7f0, and so forth \u2014 in the spiral is less crucial, because it can also be recovered with convolutions along chromas for \u03b2\u22121 of the order of a few semitones.\nThe wavelet \u03c8\u03bb2 is now defined as a product between wavelets in time, log-frequency, and octave index:\n\u03c8\u03bb2(t, log \u03bb1) = \u03c8\u03b1(t)\u00d7 \u03c8\u03b2(log \u03bb1)\u00d7 \u03c8\u03b3(blog \u03bb1c). (9)\nDAFX-2\nIn the previous definition, \u03c8\u03b2 operates over the rectilinear logfrequency variable log \u03bb1, not over the circular chroma variable \u03c71 = {log \u03bb1}. This is to avoid artifacts at octave boundaries.\nExamples of the \"spiral wavelet\"\u03c8\u03bb2 are shown in Figure 2 for different values of \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3. To ensure invertibility and energy conservation, the quefrencies \u03b2 and \u03b3 must take negative values, including zero. We adopt the shorthand notation\nlog \u03bb2 = (log\u03b1, log |\u03b2|, sign\u03b2, log |\u03b3|, sign \u03b3) (10)\nto specify their indexing. In the special case \u03b2 = 0, \u03c8\u03b2 is no longer a wavelet but a low-pass filter whose support covers one octave. By convention, the corresponding log-frequency index is log |\u03b2| = \u2212\u221e. The same remark applies to \u03c8\u03b3 for \u03b3 = 0, which covers six octaves. Since its Fourier transform \u03c8\u0302\u03bb2 is centered at (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3), the spiral wavelet \u03c8\u03bb2 has a pitch chroma velocity of \u03b1/\u03b2 and a pitch height velocity of \u03b1/\u03b3, both measured in octaves per second.\nWe write j1\u2217 to denote convolutions across neighboring octaves. The definition for x2 is comparable to Equations (4) and (7):\nx2(t, log \u03bb1, log \u03bb2) = |x1 t,\u03c71,j1\u2217 \u03c8\u03bb2 |\n= |x1 t\u2217 \u03c8\u03b1 \u03c71\u2217 \u03c8\u03b2 j1\u2217 \u03c8\u03b3 |.\n(11)\nRolling up pitches into a spiral is a well-established idea in music, if only because of circularity of musical pitch classes. It has been studied by Shepard [5], Risset [6], and Deutsch [7] to build paradoxes in perception of pitch, and is corroborated by functional imaging of the auditory cortex (see Warren [8])."}, {"heading": "3.
