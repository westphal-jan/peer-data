Standard approaches to combining concepts, e.g. fuzzy set theory, have been shown to be inadequate [Osherson and Smith, 1981]. Composite labels frequently have \u2018emergent attributes\u2019 [Hampton, 1987] which cannot be explicated by decomposing the label into its constituent parts. We argue that in this case a new concept is generated. This project aims to determine conditions for such concept generation, using multi-agent models of language evolution."}, {"heading": "1.1 Thesis Outline", "text": "The project divides into three parts. Firstly, we have developed a model of concept combination within the label semantics framework as given in [Lawry and Tang, 2009]. The model is inspired by and reflects results in [Hampton, 1987], in which membership in a composite concept can be rendered as the weighted sum of memberships in individual concepts.\nSecondly, we must show that compositionality can evolve within a population of interacting agents. Preliminary work in this area examines the ability of a population of agents to converge to a shared set of dimension weights.\nThirdly, we will investigate the generation of new unitary concepts from existing composite concepts, building further upon the multi-agent model."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "This work is based on the label semantics framework [Lawry, 2004; Lawry and Tang, 2009], together with prototype theory [Rosch, 1975], where membership in a concept is based on proximity to a prototype, and conceptual spaces [Ga\u0308rdenfors, 2004]. The latter views concepts as regions of a space made\nup of quality dimensions and equipped with a distance metric, for example the RGB colour space.\nLabel semantics proposes that agents use a set of labels LA = {L1, ..., Ln} to describe a conceptual space \u2126 with distance metric d(x, y). Labels Li are associated with prototypes Pi \u2286 \u2126 and uncertain thresholds \u03b5i, drawn from probability distributions \u03b4\u03b5i . The threshold \u03b5i captures the notion that an element x \u2208 \u2126 is sufficiently close to Pi to be labelled Li. The appropriateness of a label Li to describe x is quantified by \u00b5Li(x), given by\n\u00b5Li(x) = P (d(x, Pi) \u2264 \u03b5i) = \u222b \u221e d(x,Pi) \u03b4\u03b5i(\u03b5i)d\u03b5i\nLabels can then be described as Li =<Pi, d(x, y), \u03b4\u03b5i>."}, {"heading": "3 A New Model of Concept Composition", "text": "Experiments in [Hampton, 1987] propose that human concept combination can (roughly) be modelled as a weighted sum of attributes such as \u2018has feathers\u2019, \u2018talks\u2019 (for the concept \u2018Bird\u2019). These attributes differ from quality dimensions in conceptual spaces: they tend to be binary, complex, and multidimensional. We therefore view each attribute as a label in a conceptual space \u2126i and combine these labels in a binary space {0, 1}n illustrated in figure 1, where a conjunction of such labels \u03b1\u0303 = \u2227n i=1\u00b1Li maps to a binary vector ~x\u03b1 taking value 1 for positive labels Li and 0 for negated labels \u00acLi. We treat membership in \u03b1\u0303 in the binary space within the label semantics framework. So \u03b1\u0303 is described in the binary space by \u03b1\u0303 =<~x\u03b1, d(~x, ~x\u2032), \u03b4> as before.\nWe define a distance metric in the binary space {0, 1}n as:\nar X\niv :1\n60 1.\n06 73\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 5\nJa n\n20 16\nDefinition 1 Weighted Hamming Distance For ~\u03bb \u2208 (R+)n, \u2200~x, ~x\u2032 \u2208 {0, 1}n, where (\u00b7) is the scalar product,\nH~\u03bb(~x, ~x \u2032) = ~\u03bb \u00b7 |~x\u2212 ~x\u2032| Theorem 2 Let \u03b1 = \u2227n i=1\u00b1Li and \u03bbT = \u2211n i=1 \u03bbi. Let \u03b5 \u223c U(0, \u03bbT ), d = H~\u03bb. Then:\n\u00b5\u03b1\u0303(~Y ) = n\u2211 i=1 \u03bbi \u03bbT \u00b5\u00b1Li(Yi)\nCompound concepts \u03b8\u0303, \u03d5\u0303 may be combined in a higher level binary space. Then \u03b8\u0303 \u2022 \u03d5\u0303 can be expressed in the continuous space as a weighted sum of \u03b8\u0303 and \u03d5\u0303.\nTheorem 3 Let \u03b8\u0303\u2022\u03d5\u0303 =<{(1, 1)}, H~w, \u03b4>.

We have further characterised notions of necessary and impossible attributes using ideas from possibility theory."}, {"heading": "4 Convergence of Dimension Weights Across a Population", "text": "We investigate how a population of agents in a multi-agent simulation playing a series of language games might converge to a shared set of dimension weights. Agents with equal labels L1 = L2 =<1, d, U [0, 1]>\u2208 \u21261 = \u21262 = [0, 1] (d is Euclidean distance), and randomly initiated weights \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1] engage in a series of dialogues about elements in the conceptual space, adjusting their weights after each dialogue is completed. At each timestep, speaker agents make assertions \u03b1i = \u00b1L1 \u2227 \u00b1L2 about elements ~x \u2208 \u21261 \u00d7 \u21262 which maximise \u00b5\u03b1i(~x) = \u03bb\u00b5L1(x1) + (1\u2212 \u03bb)\u00b5L2(x2).\nThe listener agent assesses \u03b1i against its own label set. If \u00b5\u03b1i(x) \u2264 w, the reliability of the speaker agent, the listener agent updates its label set.\nThe update consists in incrementing the dimension weight \u03bb towards a value A, so that \u03bbt+1 = \u03bbt + h(A \u2212 \u03bbt) where h = 10\u22123 and\nA = w \u2212 \u00b5L2(x2)\n\u00b5\u00b1L1(x1)\u2212 \u00b5\u00b1L2(x2)\nThis is the quantity that satisfies \u00b5\u03b1i(x) = w. If A < 0 (or A > 1) we set A = 0 (or A = 1).\nThe convergence across the population is measured by the standard deviation (SD) of the \u03bb across the population.\nFigure 2 shows the results of two sets of simulations across varying values ofw. The two sets of simulations have distinct distributions of elements encountered within the space. When w is 0.5 or below, the agents do not converge to shared dimension weights (not shown). Whenw > 0.5, agents do converge to shared dimension weights: SD is low. The weights converged to depend both on the reliability, w, of each agent, and the distribution of elements in the conceptual space.\nWhen w = 1 we can predict the value to which \u03bb will converge. Consider the quantity A \u2212 \u03bbt which determines whether the update is positive or negative at each step. Definition 4 A positive region R+ \u2282 \u2126 is a set of points R+ = {~x \u2208 \u2126 : A\u2212 \u03bbt \u2265 0} Theorem 5 Let p+ denote the probability of a point ~x \u2208 \u2126 falling in a positive region and let w = 1 across the population. Then the expected value of \u03bb converges to p+."}, {"heading": "5 Further Work", "text": "We are currently working on analytical results to predict the value of \u03bb to which agents converge. Under certain circumstances, such as the case where w = 1, or with an altered updating model, analytic results are possible. We will extend this work to look at the utility of using conjunctive assertions within these simulations.\nWork in the third year will focus on examining how new concepts might be generated from the combination of existing ones. We will build on the language evolution model currently in development."}], "references": [{"title": "Conceptual spaces: The geometry of thought", "author": ["P.
