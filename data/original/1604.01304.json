Multi-label classification attracted increasing attention from various domains (Vens et al., 2008; Nicolas et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014) in these years. Due to several motivating real-life applications, such as image/video annotation (Weston et al., 2011; Kong et al., 2012) and query/keyword suggestions (Agrawal et al., 2013), the recent research on multi-label classification has largely shifted its focus to the other end of the spectrum where the number of labels is assumed to be extremely large (Chen and Lin, 2012; Agrawal et al., 2013; Bi and Kwok, 2013; Lin et al., 2014).\nMulti-label classification with many labels encounters the scalability challenge: how to design\nscalable algorithms that offer fast training procedures and have a small memory footprint. The standard multi-label classification approaches are computationally infeasible, when the number of labels is extremely large. For example, the simplest standard multi-label classification approach Binary Relevance (BR) is not applicable for a multi-label classification problem with 104 labels. BR trains a classifier for each label so that it need train 104 classifiers. The high training time complexity makes it computationally infeasible. BR is not applicable, not to mention the more sophisticated and computationally demanding approaches. There exists some works for multilabel classification with many labels. The mainstream approaches are called Label Space Dimension Reduction (LSDR) (Hsu et al., 2009; Tai and Lin, 2012; Chen and Lin, 2012; Lin et al., 2014; Bi and Kwok, 2013). LSDR encodes the high-dimensional label vectors into low dimensional code vectors. Then predictive models are trained from instances to code vectors. To predict an unseen instance, a low-dimensional code vector is firstly obtained with the predictive models, and then be decoded for the label vector. Besides LSDR, there are another approaches with different style, and we call them RepresentationBased Learning (RBL) (Weston et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2014; Rai et al., 2015) approaches. RBL learns representations for the instances and labels, and produces the predictions with these representations.\nHowever the above-mentioned approaches ignore and even compound an important problem: the label imbalance problem. The label imbalance problem is that the irrelevant labels of an instance are much more than relevant labels, and that some labels are irrelevant to more instances than other labels. As the papers (Spyromitros-Xioufis, 2011; Charte et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015) pointed out, the label imbalance problem exists in\nar X\niv :1\n60 4.\n01 30\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 5\nA pr\n2 01\n6\nthe standard multi-label classification, and harms the performance. The label imbalance problem becomes more serious in multi-label classification with many labels. Because more labels are irrelevant to an instance when the number of labels is large. To show the phenomenon, we can use the imbalance ratio defined in (Zhang et al., 2015) to evaluate the label imbalance degree. For a label, the imbalance ratio is the ratio of the number of irrelevant instances to the number of relevant instances.\nImRj = num of irrelevant instances\nnum of relevant instances\nImR = 1\nm m\u2211 j=1 ImRj\nwhere ImRj denotes the imbalance ratio for the j-th label, ImR denotes the average of the imbalance ratios. The high imbalance ratio indicates the serious label imbalance problem. The Enron dataset (Goldstein et al., 2006) has 45 labels and its average imbalance ratio is 3. 34. TheEurlex desc dataset (Mencia and Fu\u0308rnkranz, 2008) has 3993 labels and its average imbalance ratio is 1,378.58, much larger than the Enron dataset\u2019s. The label imbalance problem in the Eurlex desc dataset is more serious than that in the Enron dataset. Hence we need attach more importance to the label imbalance problem in multi-label classification with many labels. However the existing approaches ignore the label imbalance problem. Even LSDR compounds this problem. The labels with very little relevant instances contain little information. So the lossy compression in LSDR may consider these labels as noisy and drop information about them.\nTo address this drawback, we propose a novel Representation-based Multi-label Learning with Sampling (RMLS) approach, which can tackles the label imbalance problem in multi-label classification with many labels. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to tackle the imbalance problem in multi-label classification with many labels. RMLS is a RBL approach and employs a representation learning framework with a sampling strategy."}, {"heading": "2 Related Works", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Multi-label Classification with Many Labels", "text": "We categorize the existing approaches for multilabel classification with many labels into two types: Label Space Dimension Reduction (LSDR) and Representation-Based Learning (RBL). Figure 1 (it is from (Lin et al., 2014)) is the schematic diagram of LSDR. LSDR encodes the high-dimensional label vectors into low dimensional code vectors. Then predictive models are trained from instances to code vectors. To predict an unseen instance, a low-dimensional code vector is firstly obtained with the learnt predictive models, and then be decoded for the label vector.\nCompressive Sensing (CS) (Hsu et al., 2009) is the first LSDR approach. Specifically, CS linearly encodes the original label space as compressed sensing and uses standard recovery algorithms for decoding. Principle Label Space Transformation (PLST) (Tai and Lin, 2012) performs PCA on the label matrix Y to get the compressing matrix V\nV \u2217 = argmax V TV =I Tr(V TY TY V ) (1)\nUsing the compressing matrix, we can obtain code vector c = yV . CS and PLST aim to find the compressing matrix with high recoverability. However they don\u2019t consider the predictability of the code vector. With high predictability, it will is easy to train the model to predict the code vector. Conditional Principal Label Space Transformation (CPLST) (Chen and Lin, 2012) considers the predictability, and optimizes the following problem to\nget the compressing matrix.\nV \u2217 = argmax V TV =I Tr(V TY TXX+Y V ) (2)\nCPLST argues that the compressing matrix obtained by this way can balances the predictability with recoverability. Feature-aware Implicit label space Encoding (FaIE) (Lin et al., 2014) balances predictability with recoverability, and optimize the following problem.\nV \u2217 = argmax V TV =I Tr(V T (Y Y T + \u03b1XX+))V ) (3)\nwhere \u03b1 denotes a parameter specified by users. Column Subset Selection for Multi-Label (CSS ML) (Bi and Kwok, 2013) seeks to select exactly k representative labels so as to span all labels as much as possible. Then CSS ML learns k classifiers for these selected labels. For unseen instance, CSS ML predicts k selected labels and spans the predictions for all labels. CSS ML can be considered as a special LSDR approach.\nRBL learns representations for instances and labels, and produces the predictions with these representations. Web Scale Annotation by Image Embedding (WSABIE) (Weston et al., 2011) trains the representation model by minimizing the Weighted Approximate-Rank Pairwise (WARP) loss function. Low rank Empirical risk minimization for Multi-Label Learning (LEML) (Yu et al., 2014) develops a fast optimization scheme for the representation model with different loss functions, and analyses the representation model\u2019s generalization error. Bayesian Multi-label Learning via Positive Labels (BMLPL) (Rai et al., 2015) uses the topic model to represent instance, and learns the model with only relevant labels"}, {"heading": "2.2 Label Imbalance Problem", "text": "The label imbalance problem has attracted some attention from the multi-label classification community. One solution to label-imbalance multilabel learning is to train a classifier for a label and deal with the skewness in each classifier via popular binary imbalance techniques such as random or synthetic undersampling/oversampling (Spyromitros-Xioufis, 2011; Tahir et al., 2012; Charte et al., 2013; Charte et al., 2015). The paper (Zhang et al., 2015) improves this approach by aggregating one binary-class imbalance learner corresponding to the current label and several multi-class imbalance learners coupling with other\nlabels for prediction. Besides integrating binary decomposition, Petterson et al (Petterson and Caetano, 2010) and Dembczynski et al (Dembczynski et al., 2013) address the label imbalance problem by directly optimizing imbalance-specific metric.\nAll of the above-mentioned approach solve the label imbalance problem by incorporating more correlations or designing more complex algorithms. These approaches are so complex that they are only applicable to the multi-label learning with the number of labels assumed to be small. In this paper, we aim to addressing the label imbalance problem in multi-label classification with many labels."}, {"heading": "3 Models", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Preliminaries", "text": "Let X denote the instance feature space, and Y = {0, 1}m denote label space with m labels. A instance x \u2208 X is associated with a label vector y = (y1, y2, ..., ym), where yj = 1 denotes the j-th label is relevant to the instance and yj = 0 otherwise. The goal of multi-label learning is to learn a function f : X \u2192 Y . In general, the function f consists of m functions, one for a label, i.e., f(x) = [f1(x), f2(x), ..., fm(x)], where f j(x) is the prediction of the relevance between the instance x and the j-th label."}, {"heading": "3.2 Representation Learning", "text": "The architecture of RMLS is as shown in figure 2. The feature vectorx is mapped to a low-dimension feature representation vector h with a mapping matrixW\nh = \u03b8(xW ) (4)\nwhere \u03b8 is an activation function. Each label corresponds a low-dimension label representation vector, denoted by l1, l2, ..., lm. The dimension of the\nfeature representation vector and the label representation vector are identical. The prediction for the j-th label, denoted by f j(x), is produced by the inner dot of the feature representation vector h and the j-th label representation vector lj . We add an activation function \u03c3 to the inner dot, for example, the logistic function.\nf j(x) = \u03c3(hT lj) (5)\nwhere \u03c3 is an activation function. our family of models have constrained norms:\n||W ||2F \u2264 C1 ||lj ||22 \u2264 C2, j = 1, ...,m (6)\nThe constrained norms acts as a regularizer in the same way as is used in lasso (Tibshirani, 1996)\nIf we set the dimension of the feature representation vector to be k, the number of parameters mapping an instance x to an feature representation vector h is d \u00d7 k, the number of parameters of all label representation vectors is k \u00d7 m. So the total number of parameters of RMLS is d \u00d7 k + k \u00d7 m. The simplest standard multilabel classification model BR trains m classifiers. If the classifier in BR is a linear model with d parameters, the total number of parameters of BR is d \u00d7 m. Generally speaking, k is much less than min(d,m), so that the number of parameters of RMLS is much less than that of BR. The less parameters mean less training cost.\nBoth of LSDR and RBL reduce the number of parameters by this way. LSDR encodes the label vectors into the code vectors and generates a recovery matrix Rk\u00d7m 1. Then LSDR learns regression models Gd\u00d7k mapping from the instances to the code vectors. The total number of parameters of LSDR is d \u00d7 k + k \u00d7 m. RBL learns a model W d\u00d7k mapping instances to lowdimension instance representation vectors. The number of parameters of label representation vectors is k \u00d7 m. The total number of parameters of RBL is d \u00d7 k + k \u00d7 m too. The number of parameters of LSDR and RBL are the same, since the architecture of them are identical. For an unseen instance x, LSDR produces the code vectors with c = xGd\u00d7k, and then produces the prediction p with p = cGd\u00d7k = xGd\u00d7kRk\u00d7m.\n1In this paragraph, we show the size of matrixes with subscripts\nRBL produces the instance representation vector with h = xW d\u00d7k. If we treat the label representation vectors as the columns of a label matrix Lk\u00d7m, and set the activation function to the linear function, the prediction is produced with p = hLk\u00d7m = xW d\u00d7kLk\u00d7m. Hence the linear regression modelGd\u00d7k in LSDR is the equal of the mapping matrix W d\u00d7k in RBL, and the recovery matrix Rk\u00d7m in LSDR is equal of the label matrixLk\u00d7m in RBL. The difference between LSDR and RBL is how to obtain the parameters. LDSR obtains parameters by linear algebra approaches, and RBL learns the model by gradient descent approaches. RMLS is not the first RBL approach, however we are the first to point out that LSDR and RBL have identical architectures and the same number of parameters."}, {"heading": "3.3 Sampling Strategy", "text": "Our goal is to identify relevant labels from irrelevant labels.

The loss function L is as shown in the following formula.\nL = m\u2211 j=1 `(f j(x), yj) (7)\n` denotes the classification loss function. Different classification loss functions can be used as `, for example, cross entropy loss, least square loss and L2 hinge loss.\nWith the serious label imbalance problem, the cost of classifying relevant labels as irrelevant is higher than that of classifying irrelevant labels as relevant. Incorporating this consideration into the loss function, the loss function becomes as follows.\nL = \u2211 j\u2208P `(f j(x), yj) + 1 C \u2211 j\u2208N `(f j(x), yj) (8)\nWhereP = {j|yj = 1} is the set of relevant labels andN = {j|yj = 0} is the set of irrelevant labels.\nWith the loss function, the overall risk we want to minimize is\nR(f ) = \u222b \u2211 j\u2208P `(f j(x), yj) + 1 C \u2211 j\u2208N `(f j(x), yj)dp(x,y) (9)\nAn unbiased estimator of this risk can be obtained by stochastically sampling |N |C irrelevant labels with the uniform distribution, and minimizing the\nloss function over the relevant labels and the chosen irrelevant labels.
