Introduction\nIn recent years, the Internet has become the cornerstone of global telecommunications, to the point that it now plays an integral part in sustaining the growth of the world economy. Specifically, as more and more users are using the Internet for backing up data, video on demand (VoD), device synchronization and other IT services, datahungry applications are experiencing a wildfire growth that affects almost all aspects of modern-day, always-connected societies. As a result, optical networks must grow fast enough so as to avoid experiencing a \u201ccapacity crunch\u201d that will cripple their ability to handle the requested traffic in a reliable and efficient manner [3].\nP. Mertikopoulos is with the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the Laboratoire d\u2019Informatique de Grenoble (LIG), F-38000, Grenoble, France. A. L. Moustakas and A. Tzanakaki are with the Physics Department of the National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece. Part of this work appeared in the conference paper [1] and the report [2].\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n01 45\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.N I]\n4 M\nay 2\n01 6\n2 At the same time however, energy consumption in data networks must also be kept in check: in total, power consumption from information and communications technology (ICT) applications has been estimated to 4% of the global energy consumption [4], with a steeply rising trend as we progress toward the Internet of Things (IoT) era. In particular, just in the United States, Internet equipment consumes a staggering 8% of the total energy with a predicted growth of 50% within a decade [5]. Therefore, in addition to the always-present requirements of minimizing latencies and maximizing throughput, there is a key developing need to operate optical networks in an energy-aware way that minimizes power expenditure to the bare minimum. This last goal becomes especially prominent when taking into account the power needs of large switching and data centers (DCs) which are rapidly becoming a dominant term in the power consumption equation due the huge amounts of traffic that they service [6, 7].\nIn this paper, motivated by the massive deployment of power-hungry data centers described above, we examine the problem of routing traffic with the aim of minimizing the network\u2019s traffic-driven power consumption. To achieve this, centralized optimization is not an option, because it is neither scalable nor flexible. Instead, one needs distributed load management as close as possible to the link level while ensuring that routing choices strike an optimal balance between \u201cgreener\u201d, more efficient \u2013 but possibly congested \u2013 network facilities and \u201chungrier\u201d, legacy resources that may be under-utilized. To tackle this issue, we derive a game-theoretic pricing scheme [8] which reconciles the selfish solution concept of (nonatomic) Nash equilibrium with social optimality (i.e. states that minimize global power consumption in the network). Building on this equivalence, we further propose a distributed learning scheme based on the Botlzmann distribution of statistical mechanics, which bears strong ties to replicator-based methods [9\u201312] and the class of exponential learning schemes used in finite (atomic) games [13\u201315].\nExploiting these links, we are able to show that the proposed routing scheme converges rapidly to a socially efficient state \u2013 in practice, within a few iterations. However, a key limiting factor in these considerations is that data traffic may exhibit significant spatiotemporal fluctuations because different applications have highly variable characteristic time scales. In addition, obtaining perfect information on the energy consumption of each switch/data center is a very challenging task in large networks due to real-time propagation delays, hierarchical topology aggregation and update sparsity (so as to keep the signaling overhead in check) [16\u201318]. This uncertainty is exacerbated further in highly dynamic networks where state information becomes obsolete very fast; accordingly, it is not clear whether a routing scheme designed for static, deterministic networks can maintain its convergence properties under uncertainty and noise.\nTo account for this crucial challenge, we focus on the performance of the proposed Boltzmann routing method in the presence of unpredictable stochastic disturbances. Using tools from stochastic analysis and It\u00f4 calculus [19, 20], we show that Boltzmann routing is exceptionally robust in this regard: first, by finetuning the choice of the method\u2019s so-called inverse temperature, we show that the network\u2019s long-term average consumption converges within \u03b5 of its minimum value in at most O\u0303(1/\u03b52) time, irrespective of the fluctuations\u2019 magnitude. Moreover, if the network admits a strict, non-mixing optimum state, the method converges to it almost surely (a.s.), no matter the degree of volatility. Finally, if the network instead admits an interior, fully-mixing optimum state, the proposed scheme remains arbitrarily close to said state with probability arbitrarily close to 1, provided that the scheme\u2019s inverse temperature parameter is\n3 taken sufficiently small.\nThe performance of Boltzmann routing is validated by means of extensive numerical simulations modeling an optical data network deployed over the largest metropolitan centers of the continental US. Our results show that Boltzmann routing represents a scalable and flexible method that reduces traffic-driven energy consumption by a factor of 40% over simple shortest-path/closest-destination routing modes, even under high degrees of volatility and uncertainty.\nPaper outline\nIn Section II, we present our network energy consumption model and a Pigouvian pricing scheme based on the theory of nonatomic congestion games. Subsequently, in Section III, we introduce the proposed Boltzmann routing method, first in a deterministic and then in a fully stochastic environment. Our main theoretical results (outlined above) are presented in Section IV, in both a deterministic and a stochastic context. Finally, Section V contains our numerical simulations in practical optical networks with diverse link, switching, and data center specifications. To streamline our presentation, technical proofs have been relegated to a series of appendices at the end.\nII. SystemModel and Problem Formulation\nIn this section, we describe our model for power consumption in optical networks where traffic demands are routed towards a set of service provisioning infrastructures \u2013 the network\u2019s data centers (DCs). After a few preliminaries in Section II-A, we discuss the specifics of power consumption in Section II-B and we present our game-theoretic model and pricing scheme in Section II-C.\nA. Preliminaries\nFollowing the standard traffic model of [21\u201325], we begin with a finite undirected graph with vertex set V and edge set E , describing respectively the network\u2019s nodes and links. We assume that traffic in the network is generated in continuous streams by a set of source nodes S \u2286 V , each node s \u2208 S generating traffic demands at rate %s > 0 towards a set of destination nodes Ds \u2286 V . In our setting, the traffic generated at each node represents the aggregation of the demands of a very large number of infinitesimal, nonatomic users \u2013 for instance, a city\u2019s smartphone users accessing a cloud-based service. By the same token, the destination set Ds represents the network\u2019s data centers (or a subset thereof), so each traffic element generated at source s is to be delivered in an anycast fashion to any one of the destination nodes in Ds (for a schematic representation, see Fig. 1).1\nBased on the routing choices of each individual traffic element, this traffic is split over a small, relevant set As of paths (or routes) that have been chosen offline so as to join source s \u2208 S to the associated destination set Ds (for\n1This generic setup can easily account for a variety of different delivery semantics, such as unicast or multicast routing. For instance, in the unicast case, each infinitesimal traffic element generated at s would simply be addressed to a specific destination node in Ds instead of any d \u2208 Ds [23, 24]. Essentially, switching to a different delivery scheme is just a matter of notation; given our motivation, we focus on anycast routing throughout, but our results also apply to these different routing schemes.\ninstance, all paths with the lowest hop-count). As such, if x\u03b1 denotes the amount of traffic routed from source s \u2208 S via the path \u03b1 \u2208 As, the corresponding flow profile xs = (x\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208As will be an element of the scaled simplex\nXs = { xs \u2208 As : \u2211 \u03b1\u2208As x\u03b1 = %s and x\u03b1 \u2265 0 for all \u03b1 \u2208 As } . (1)\nCoalescing all these individual flow distributions into a single state variable, the aggregate profile x = (xs)s\u2208S \u2208\u220f s As will be referred to as the network\u2019s state and the set X \u2261\u220fs Xs of all such states will be called the state space of the network. For concision, it will often be convenient to write x = (x\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208A where A = \u22c3 s As denotes the set of all utilized paths in the network; since a path \u03b1 \u2208 A uniquely determines its source and destination nodes, there is no risk of confusion.\nNow, if the network is at state x \u2208 X , the load we on edge e \u2208 E is defined as the sum of all flows through e, namely\nwe = \u2211 \u03b1\u2208A \u03b13e x\u03b1 = \u2211 \u03b1\u2208A \u03a0e\u03b1x\u03b1, (2)\nwhere \u03a0 = (\u03a0e\u03b1)e\u2208E ,\u03b1\u2208A denotes the edge-path incidence matrix of the network, viz.\n\u03a0e\u03b1 =  1 if e \u2208 \u03b1, 0 otherwise. (3)\nWith this in mind, we associate to each edge e \u2208 E a consumption (or cost) function ce : + \u2192 reflecting the negative externalities induced on edge e due to its traffic load we. In realistic network scenarios, the externalities incurred on a given edge e \u2208 E increase (or, at best, do not decrease) with the underlying load we; furthermore, these externalities accrue at an increased rate as the load increases. On that account, our only assumption will be:\nAssumption 1. The network\u2019s consumption functions ce : + \u2192 are convex and nondecreasing.\nRemark 1. The implications of Assumption 1 in the context of power consumption in optical networks are detailed in the following section; we only state here that this hypothesis is sufficiently broad so as to accommodate a wide variety of congestion-limited frameworks, ranging from latency minimization [21, 23, 25] to urban traffic management\n5 [22, 24], etc.2 For this reason, all our analysis will be carried out under the general umbrella of Assumption 1.\nWith all this at hand, we obtain the global consumption minimization problem minimize C(x) = \u2211 e\u2208E ce(we)\nsubject to w = \u03a0x, x \u2208 X . (CM)\nIn words, the network states x\u2217 that solve (CM) minimize the aggregate consumption C(x) over the entire network; as such, the solutions of (CM) will be called the network\u2019s socially optimum states. As we show below, the set of such states has a particularly simple structure under Assumption 1:\nProposition 1. The solution set X \u2217 of (CM) is nonempty, convex and compact. Moreover, if the network\u2019s consumption functions are strictly increasing and convex, every solution of (CM) induces the same load profile w\u2217 = (w\u2217e)e\u2208E ; finally, if the utilized paths \u03b1 \u2208 A are also linearly independent (in the sense that the network\u2019s path-edge incidence matrix \u03a0 is invertible on X ), the global minimization problem (CM) admits a unique solution x\u2217 \u2208 X .\nProof: The first part of our claim is a classic result that follows immediately from the compactness of X and the convexity of each ce, e \u2208 E \u2013 see e.g. [23, 26]. For our second assertion, simply note that if the network\u2019s cost functions are strictly convex and increasing, C is strictly convex as a function of w, so it admits a unique solution w\u2217. Hence, if \u03a0 is invertible on X , the equation w\u2217 = \u03a0x\u2217 admits a unique solution x\u2217 \u2208 X , as claimed. The above result shows that the network\u2019s set of socially optimum states has some fairly desirable attributes; however, it does not provide a way for the network\u2019s users to compute (or otherwise converge to) such a state in a distributed way. This question underlies much of this paper\u2019s motivation, so we address it in detail in Sections III and IV.\nB. Energy consumption in optical data networks\nAs we mentioned in the introduction, traffic-driven power consumption in optical data networks occurs at two basic levels: (i) at the link level (including all wavelength-related and transmission line elements); and (ii) at the data center level (including all costs to service, process and/or store demands at the network\u2019s data centers, cooling, etc.) [27, 28]. We will thus consider two types of power consumption functions:\n1) Link-based consumption. At the transmission line, power consumption typically comprises two parts: a) a traffic-\nindependent component (due to amplification and other factors); and b) a traffic-dependent component, proportional to the number of active wavelengths per link (including the cost of switching, electrical-to-optical and optical-to-electrical conversion, etc.). Assuming that wavelength granularity is sufficiently fine, the number of wavelengths needed to carry a traffic load w is itself proportional to w, leading to the link-based model [28, 29]\nclink(w) = Alink + Blink w, (4a)\n2For instance, assuming M/M/1 service queues in a latency minimization framework, a standard choice for ce is ce(we) = we/(\u00b5e \u2212we), where \u00b5e denotes the capacity of edge e \u2208 E [21, 23].\n6 where the values of Alink and Blink depend on the power specifications of each link. 2) Destination-based consumption. At the data center level, power consumption again comprises two parts: a) a\ntraffic-independent element (due to cooling, infrastructure maintenance, etc.); and b) a traffic-dependent part, proportional to the induced CPU load \u2013 and hence, proportional to the traffic load at each data center. We thus obtain the consumption model [27]:\ncDC(w) = ADC + BDC w. (4b)\nOf course, the consumption model (4b) is node-based, so the edge-based formulation of the previous section does not immediately apply. However, since data centers are terminal destination nodes, this can be remedied as follows: First, adjoin to each data center node d a virtual node d\u2032 and a virtual edge e = (d, d\u2032); assume further that all traffic reaching d is rerouted to d\u2032 via e. Then, the load at d can be represented by the load on e = (d, d\u2032) and the cost function of this fictitious edge reflects the energy consumption at the data center.\nIn addition to the above, in practical optical networks, each link/data center has a finite capacity, leading to the state\nconstraint\nwe \u2264 Le for all e \u2208 E , (5)\nwhere Le represents the maximum load supported on edge e. We thus obtain the capacity-constrained consumption minimization problem minimize C(x),\nsubject to x \u2208 X0, (CM0)\nwhere\nX0 = {x \u2208 X : we = (\u03a0x)e \u2264 Le for all e \u2208 E} (6)\ndenotes the network\u2019s capacity-constrained feasible region. Clearly, if the traffic generation rates %s are very high, the set X0 may be empty, in which case (CM0) does not admit a feasible solution. It will therefore be useful to introduce the following \u03b5-relaxation of (CM0): minimize C\u03b5(x) =\n\u2211 e\u2208E c\u03b5e(we)\nsubject to w = \u03a0x, x \u2208 X , (CM\u03b5)\nwhere the \u03b5-adjusted consumption functions c\u03b5e are given by\nc\u03b5e(w) =  ce(w) if w \u2264 Le, ce(Le) + (w \u2212 Le)/\u03b5 if w \u2265 Le. (7)\nIn words, the consumption model (7) of (CM\u03b5) coincides with that of (CM0) up to the edge\u2019s maximum load Le and then increases sharply with slope 1/\u03b5. Since c\u03b5e is strictly increasing, any feasible solution of (CM0) will also be a solution of (CM\u03b5). On the other hand, given that X is compact and nonempty, (CM\u03b5) always admits a solution, even when (CM0) does not; in this case, the solutions of (CM\u03b5) can be considered as \u201capproximate\u201d solutions to (CM0) in the limit \u03b5\u2192 0. We formalize this in the following proposition:\n7 Proposition 2. Let C\u2217\u03b5 = min{C\u03b5(x) : x \u2208 X } denote the minimum value of the global minimization problem (CM\u03b5), and let C\u22170 denote the corresponding quantity for the capacity-constrained problem (CM0). Then, lim\u03b5\u21920 C \u2217 \u03b5 = C \u2217 0 (with the standard convention min\u2205 = \u221e).\nProof: Write X\u03b5 = X for the feasible set of (CM\u03b5), \u03b5 > 0. By construction, the set-valued correspondence \u03b5 7\u2192 X\u03b5, \u03b5 \u2265 0, is upper hemicontinuous [30] and the objective function of (CM\u03b5) coincides with that of (CM) on X0. Thus, by a precursor to Berge\u2019s maximum theorem [30, Lemma 16.30], it follows that the function \u03b5 7\u2192 C\u2217\u03b5, \u03b5 \u2265 0, is lower semicontinuous. Since lim\u03b5\u21920 c\u03b5e(w) = \u221e for all w > Le, our claim is immediate.\nIn what follows, we will assume for simplicity that the capacity-constrained feasible region X0 of (CM0) is nonempty (after all, there is nothing to optimize if X0 is empty). In this case, using the \u03b5-relaxation (CM\u03b5) allows us to recover the solutions of (CM0) in the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0. Given that the \u03b5-adjusted consumption functions c\u03b5e satisfy Assumption 1, this will allow us to apply the general analysis for (CM), even in the presence of capacity constraints of the form (5).\nC. Pigouvian pricing and Nash equilibrium\nIn a fully distributed environment, the system designer would like to ensure that the network\u2019s nonatomic (infinitesimal) users make socially optimal routing choices while unilaterally minimizing the price they pay for accessing the network and utilizing its resources. Following Pigou\u2019s theory of pricing [31], our approach to achieve this will be to charge agents for the externalities that they induce at a socially optimum state; in so doing, one can then ensure that such states constitute an equilibrium of the agents\u2019 selfish interactions [8, 25].\nTo make this precise, suppose that a user that sends an infinitesimal amount of traffic dx through edge e \u2208 E is charged \u03c0e(we) dx where \u03c0e(we) is the price per unit of traffic on edge e at load we. The total amount charged over path \u03b1 \u2208 A will then be \u03c0\u03b1(x) dx =\n\u2211 e\u2208\u03b1 \u03c0e(we) dx, (8)\nso a (nonatomic) user will be satisfied with his routing choice if the charged price \u03c0\u03b1(x) is the lowest among all other available paths/destinations [32]. Formally:\nDefinition 1. A state x\u2217 \u2208 X is at Nash equilibrium if, for all paths \u03b1 \u2208 A with x\u2217\u03b1 > 0, we have\n\u03c0\u03b1(x\u2217) = min \u03b2\u223c\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b2(x\u2217), (NE)\nwhere the minimum is taken over all paths \u03b2 \u223c \u03b1 originating at the same source as \u03b1. In words, x\u2217 is a Nash equilibrium when every nonatomic user chooses the least expensive path.\nWe will also say that x\u2217 is an interior (or fully-mixing) Nash equilibrium if x\u2217 \u2208 int(X ), i.e. if it employs all paths \u03b1 \u2208 A; by contrast, x\u2217 will be called strict (or non-mixing) if arg min\u03b1\u2208As \u03c0\u03b1(x\u2217) is a singleton for every source node s \u2208 S.\nA standard result in the theory of nonatomic congestion games is that Nash equilibria can be characterized as the\n8 solutions of a certain convex program. Specifically, following [22\u201324, 26, 33], consider the potential function\nU(x) = \u2211 e\u2208E Ue(we) (9)\nwhere w = \u03a0x and\nUe(x) = \u222b we\n0 \u03c0e(w) dw. (10)\nThen, as was shown in [26, 33], x\u2217 is a Nash equilibrium if and only if it solves the potential minimization problem\nx\u2217 \u2208 arg min x\u2208X U(x). (PM)\nHence, by comparing (PM) and (CM), we obtain the following Pigouvian pricing scheme:\nProposition 3. If the charged price per unit of traffic on edge e is \u03c0e(we) = \u2202\u2212ce(we), Nash equilibria coincide with the solutions of the global consumption minimization problem (CM).\nRemark 2. In the above, \u2202\u2212ce(we) denotes the left derivative of ce at we. This derivative always exists because ce is assumed convex [34]; if ce is smooth, we can simply take \u03c0e = c\u2032e.\nProposition 3 describes the pricing scheme that the system designer should use so that selfish, cost-minimizing users end up minimizing global power consumption at equilibrium. As such, in the rest of this paper, we will assume that prices are set in accordance to Proposition 3, so that socially optimum states for (CM) coincide with the network\u2019s Nash equilibria under \u03c0.\nIII. Boltzmann Routing\nIn this section, we present a distributed routing scheme to attain a socially efficient state based on a logit-type learning rule inspired from statistical mechanics. This scheme consists of two basic steps: First, each source node s \u2208 S keeps a running \u201cscore\u201d for each path starting at s by aggregating the associated end-to-end price over time. Then, every nonatomic user based at s chooses a path (and hence, a destination node d \u2208 Ds) with probability inversely proportional to the exponential of this performance score \u2013 in analogy to the Boltzmann distribution of statistical mechanics.\nFor generality, throughout this section, we focus on the global minimization problem (CM) with consumption functions satisfying Assumption 1; the specifics of energy efficiency in optical data networks are discussed in Section V. To streamline our presentation, we first develop our routing scheme in a deterministic setting with perfect information. Subsequently, we extend our model to a fully stochastic setting where the network is subject to random perturbations (arising e.g. from fluctuations in background traffic, link quality, estimation errors, etc.). We then present our convergence analysis and theoretical results in Section IV.\nA. Boltzmann routing\nThe first step in setting up our routing scheme is to introduce a path\u2019s \u201cscore\u201d, interpreted here as a cumulative measure of the path\u2019s price over time. More precisely, if x(t) denotes the state of the system at time t, we define the\n9 score of path \u03b1 \u2208 A as y\u03b1(t) = y\u03b1(0) + \u222b t 0 \u03c0\u03b1(x(s)) ds, (11) i.e. as the cumulative price of path \u03b1 over the time interval [0, t] (the value y\u03b1(0) is an arbitrary constant that represents an initial assessment of the path\u2019s price).\nClearly, high scores indicate commensurately high prices, so such paths should be selected with low probability. We thus posit that a nonatomic user starting at s selects path \u03b1 \u2208 As with probability given by the Boltzmann distribution\nP\u03b1(t) \u221d exp(\u2212\u03b7(t) y\u03b1(t)), (B)\nwhere \u03b7(t) > 0 is an inverse temperature parameter whose role is explained below. Thus, writing (11) in differential form and invoking the law of large numbers to obtain the flow induced by (B), we obtain the Boltzmann routing scheme\ny\u0307\u03b1 = \u03c0\u03b1(x), x\u03b1 = %s exp(\u2212\u03b7y\u03b1)\u2211 \u03b2\u2208As exp(\u2212\u03b7y\u03b2) , (BR)\nwhere s \u2261 s(\u03b1) denotes the starting point of \u03b1 and %s is the corresponding traffic generation rate. These routing dynamics will be at the core of our paper, so a few remarks are in order:\na) Basic properties: The Boltzmann scheme (BR) enjoys the following desirable properties: (P1) It is consistent: x\u03b1(t) \u2265 0 and \u2211 \u03b1\u2208As x\u03b1(t) = %s for all t \u2265 0, so x(t) is a valid state variable. (P2) It is reinforcing: traffic elements tend to be routed along paths with lower prices. (P3) It is stateless: routing choices do not require knowledge of the network\u2019s state. (P4) It is distributed: each node only needs to monitor the price of the paths that start at said node.\nWe should also note that (BR) has fairly low requirements in terms of computational complexity. Specifically, each node s \u2208 S only needs to run a cheap update on |As| variables; since the set of paths being utilized by each source node is typically small (for instance, those with the minimum hop count), every node s \u2208 S only needs to process at most O(Ds) \u2264 O(V) variables. By comparison, the application of distributed flow-deviation methods [21] would require each node to keep track of O(E) link variables and then run at each step an O(V2) shortest path algorithm, leading to updates of significantly higher complexity.\nb) Relation to the replicator dynamics: If we differentiate the network\u2019s state variable x in (BR), a straightforward\ncalculation leads to the evolutionary dynamics x\u0307\u03b1 = \u2212\u03b7x\u03b1 [ \u03c0\u03b1(x) \u2212 \u2211 \u03b2\u223c\u03b1 x\u03b2\u03c0\u03b2(x) ] + \u03b7\u0307 \u03b7 x\u03b1 [ log x\u03b1 \u2212 \u2211 \u03b2\u223c\u03b1 x\u03b2 log x\u03b2 ] , (12) where the summation is taken over all paths \u03b2 \u223c \u03b1 with the same source as \u03b1, and we have taken %s = 1 for simplicity. Thus, in the baseline case \u03b7 = 1, we obtain the dynamical system\nx\u0307\u03b1 = \u2212x\u03b1 [ \u03c0\u03b1(x) \u2212 \u2211 \u03b2\u223c\u03b1 x\u03b2\u03c0\u03b2(x) ] , (RD)\nwhich is the classical (multi-population) replicator equation of evolutionary game theory [24, 35]. In this way, (BR) can be seen as an extension of the replicator-based routing schemes of [9\u201312], the key difference being the extra,\n10\nprice-independent term of the dynamics (12). As we shall see, this additional term will be crucial for the convergence properties of (BR) under uncertainty \u2013 an open problem posed by [11].\nc) On the inverse temperature \u03b7: From an algorithmic viewpoint, the role of the inverse temperature parameter \u03b7(t) in (BR) is to act as an extrinsic weight that \u201cnormalizes\u201d the paths\u2019 scores y(t). In particular, for low \u03b7, the Boltzmann distribution (B) tends to select paths uniformly; by contrast, for high \u03b7, the induced choice probabilities \u201cfreeze\u201d down to a hard best-response scheme which routes all traffic along the path with the lowest score. Thus, to counterbalance the O(t) growth of the variables y\u03b1(t), we will assume throughout that \u03b7(t) is nonincreasing with decay rate slower than 1/t:\nAssumption 2. \u03b7(t) is C1-smooth, nonincreasing, and limt\u2192\u221e \u03b7(t)t = \u221e.\nIn thermodynamic terms, Assumption 2 means that the system is being heated over time (instead of being cooled). This comes in stark contrast with simulated annealing and log-linear learning [36] where the system begins at a high sampling temperature (\u03b7 \u2248 0) and subsequently freezes to very low temperatures (\u03b7 \u2192 \u221e) to approach a state of least energy. The reason for taking a heating schedule in (BR) is that the energy levels y\u03b1(t) of the system at hand are not fixed (as in simulated annealing) but, instead, they grow over time. As a result, if the paths\u2019 prices (whose aggregation determines the system\u2019s energy levels) are subject to randomness, freezing the system may lead it to quench prematurely to a suboptimal state; we explore this issue in detail in Section IV.\nB. Routing under uncertainty\nA key assumption underlying the (deterministic) Boltzmann routing scheme (BR) is that prices are assumed immune to exogenous stochastic fluctuations. In practice however, this assumption often fails: background traffic fluctuations can be quite substantial due to burst-like user demands, open market energy costs are highly volatile (for instance, at certain locations power may be supplied by renewable energy sources whose output depends on the weather), whereas load measurements are typically subject to errors due to delay [16], inaccurate routing information and noise [17], etc.\nStarting from (8), we will model such disturbances via the random perturbation model\n\u03c0\u0303\u03b1(x; t) = \u2211 e\u2208\u03b1 ( \u03c0e(we) + \u03bee(t) ) , (13)\nwhere \u03bee is a zero-mean stochastic process.3 The score y\u03b1 of path \u03b1 will then follow the dynamics\ny\u0307\u03b1 = \u03c0\u0303\u03b1(x) = \u03c0\u03b1(x) + \u03be\u03b1, (14)\nwhere \u03be\u03b1 = \u2211 e\u2208\u03b1 \u03bee = \u2211 e\u2208E \u03a0e\u03b1\u03bee denotes the aggregate perturbation over path \u03b1. Hence, writing (14) as an It\u00f4 (non-anticipative) stochastic differential equation [19, 20, 37], we obtain the stochastic Boltzmann routing dynamics\ndY\u03b1 = \u03c0\u03b1(X) dt + dZ\u03b1,\nX\u03b1 = %s exp(\u2212\u03b7Y\u03b1)\u2211 \u03b2\u2208As exp(\u2212\u03b7Y\u03b2) . (SBR)\n3At the most basic level, \u03bee can be assumed to be a simple additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) process.\n11\nwhere, to be consistent with (14), the path-noise process Z\u03b1 is of the form\ndZ\u03b1 = \u2211 e\u2208\u03b1 \u03c3e dWe, (15)\nwhere W = (We)e\u2208E is a standard Wiener process (Brownian motion) in E and \u03c3e \u2261 \u03c3e(x, t) is the (possibly stateand time-dependent) volatility coefficient of the fluctuations on edge e \u2208 E .\nThe dynamical system (SBR) will be our core stochastic model so we proceed with some explanatory remarks:\nd) Assumptions on the noise: The noise model (15) implies that fluctuations are independent across links, but\nnot across paths. Indeed, a simple calculation reveals the correlation structure\ndZ\u03b1 \u00b7 dZ\u03b2 = \u2211\ne,e\u2032\u2208E \u03c3e\u03c3e\u2032 dWe \u00b7 dWe\u2032 = \u2211 e,e\u2032\u2208E \u03c3e\u03c3e\u2032\u03b4ee\u2032 dt = \u2211 e\u2208\u03b1\u2229\u03b2 \u03c32e dt, (16)\ni.e. fluctuations along two paths are correlated along their common edges.4 With this in mind, it will be convenient to introduce the volatility matrix \u03a3 = (\u03c32\u03b1\u03b2)\u03b1,\u03b2\u2208A defined as\n\u03c32\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 \u2211\ne\u2208\u03b1\u2229\u03b2 \u03c32e = \u2211 e\u2208E \u03a0e\u03b1\u03a0e\u03b2\u03c3 2 e . (17)\nBy construction, the matrix \u03a3 \u2261 \u03a3(x, t) describes the quadratic covariation of the noise process Z in the sense that dZ\u03b1 \u00b7 dZ\u03b2 = \u03a3\u03b1\u03b2 dt [19, 20]. On that account, our only assumption will be:\nAssumption 3. The fluctuations\u2019 volatility matrix \u03a3 is bounded: supx,t\u2016\u03a3(x, t)\u2016 \u2261 \u03c32\u2217 < \u221e.\nRemark 3. We should clarify here that Assumption 3 means that fluctuations are only bounded in mean square; at any given time t \u2265 0, the disturbances dZe(t) could be arbitrarily large.\ne) The stochastic replicator dynamics: Even though X(t) is fully determined under (SBR) for all t \u2265 0, this is an indirect description of the governing dynamics of X(t). To obtain an explicit description of these (stochastic) dynamics, we can follow the same approach as in (12); however, because of the noise, we now have to employ the rules of (It\u00f4) stochastic calculus [19, 20, 37]. This derivation is quite convoluted, so we only present here the end result (proven in Appendix A):\nProposition 4. The solutions of (SBR) satisfy the stochastic differential equation: dX\u03b1 = \u2212 \u03b7X\u03b1 [ \u03c0\u03b1(X) \u2212 \u2211 \u03b2 X\u03b2 \u03c0\u03b2(X) ] dt (18a)\n\u2212 \u03b7X\u03b1 [ dZ\u03b1 \u2212 \u2211 \u03b2 X\u03b2 dZ\u03b2 ]\n(18b)\n+ \u03b7\u0307\n\u03b7 X\u03b1\n[ log X\u03b1 \u2212 \u2211 \u03b2 X\u03b2 log X\u03b2 ] dt (18c)\n+ \u03b72\n2 X\u03b1 [\u2211 \u03b2,\u03b3 (\u03b4\u03b1\u03b3 \u2212 X\u03b3) (\u03b4\u03b2\u03b3 \u2212 2X\u03b2)\u03c32\u03b2\u03b3 ] dt, (18d)\nwhere all sums are taken over the paths \u03b2, \u03b3 \u223c \u03b1 with the same starting point as \u03b1, and all traffic generation rates have been taken equal to %s = 1 for simplicity.\n4More generally, the edge processes We could be themselves correlated along different edges; we do not consider this for simplicity.\n12\nDespite the complex appearance of (18), each of the constituent terms admits a relatively straightforward interpre-\ntation:\na) The term (18a) drives the process in the baseline, deterministic case \u03c3 = 0, \u03b7 = constant; as such, it coincides with\nthe deterministic replicator dynamics (RD).\nb) The martingale term (18b) reflects the direct impact of the noise on the evolution of X(t). c) The term (18c) is due to the temporal variation of the inverse temperature parameter \u03b7(t) and plays the same role\nas in (12).\nd) Finally, the term (18d) is the It\u00f4 correction induced by the non-anticipative nature of the It\u00f4 integral [19, 20]. This\nterm is price-independent and does not depend on \u03b7\u0307, so it does not vanish for constant \u03b7; also, the correlation structure of the noise process Z appears explicitly in (18d) via the volatility matrix \u03a3 (cf. the remarks preceding Assumption 3).\nApart from a vaguely similar structure, there is no overlap between (18) and the stochastic replicator dynamics with \u201caggregate shocks\u201d that have been studied extensively in evolutionary biology [38\u201342]. The exponential learning approach of [13, 43] is much closer in spirit but it does not account for the nonlinear nature of the cost functions \u03c0e and the correlation structure of the noise processes Z along paths; we explore these connections in more detail below.\nIV. Convergence Analysis\nOur aim in this section will be to analyze the long-term convergence properties of the proposed Boltzmann routing scheme in the presence of noise and uncertainty. To establish a baseline, we begin with the scheme\u2019s convergence properties in a noiseless, deterministic setting:\nTheorem 1. Under (BR), x(t) converges to a solution of the global minimization problem (CM).\nGiven the connection of (BR) to the replicator dynamics, Theorem 1 (proven in Appendix B) represents a strengthening of known convergence results for potential [44] and stable games [45]. Specifically, [44] showed that the replicator dynamics (RD) converge to the set of rest points in potential games; however, since the rest points of (RD) are not necessarily solutions of (CM), we cannot use the analysis of [24, 44] to deduce the convergence of (BR) to a globally efficient state. More recently, [12] established the convergence of (RD) to the game\u2019s equilibrium set, but under the implicit assumption that the network\u2019s routes are linearly independent (an assumption that fails automatically if |A| > |E | because \u03a0 fails to be invertible on X in this case). Instead, Theorem 1 dispenses with all such assumptions and provides an unconditional convergence result for (BR).\nThis behavior of (BR) is fairly encouraging, but it is contingent on the absence of fluctuations and uncertainty. If the network is constantly subject to stochastic disturbances, there is no reason to expect that this convergence still holds beyond the \u201csmall noise\u201d regime. Nevertheless, as we show below, the proposed Boltzmann routing scheme remains exceptionally robust in the presence of noise: under (SBR), the long-term average of the total network consumption is minimized, irrespective of the level of uncertainty. Formally:\n13\nTheorem 2. Assume that (SBR) is run with a variable parameter \u03b7(t) satisfying Assumption 2. Then, the long-term average C\u0304(t) = t\u22121 \u222b t\n0 C(X(s)) ds of the network\u2019s total consumption enjoys the bound: C\u0304(t) \u2264 C\u2217 + \u2211\ns log As \u03b7(t)t + \u03c32\u2217 2t \u222b t 0 \u03b7(s) ds + 2\u03c32\u2217 \u221a log log t t + O(1/t) (a.s.) (19)\nwhere C\u2217 is the minimum value of (CM) and As = |As| is the number of paths utilized by source s \u2208 S. In particular, if \u03b7(t)\u2192 0, we have limt\u2192\u221e C\u0304(t) = C\u2217 (a.s.).\nThe proof of Theorem 2 (presented in detail in Appendix C) hinges on the so-called Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) diver-\ngence [46\u201348], defined here as\nDKL(x\u2217, x) = \u2211\ns\u2208S \u2211 \u03b1\u2208As x\u2217\u03b1 log(x \u2217 \u03b1/x\u03b1), x \u2217, x \u2208 X . (20)\nThe KL divergence provides an asymmetric measure of the information-theoretic distance between x\u2217 and x. Using this, we express the average global consumption C\u0304(t) in terms of this distance, and we then use It\u00f4\u2019s lemma [19, 20, 37] to bound it by a vanishing function of t. In so doing, we obtain the three main components of the convergence rate estimate (19): the first represents the convergence rate of the noiseless process (BR), the second is due to the It\u00f4 correction (18d), while the third one stems from the law of the iterated logarithm [37].\nImportantly, the second term of (19) does not vanish for constant \u03b7, explaining the requirement limt\u2192\u221e \u03b7(t) = 0. On the other hand, this requirement can be dropped if there is no noise: for \u03c3\u2217 = 0 and \u03b7 = constant, the RHS of (19) reduces to O(1/t). In addition, the form of (19) also highlights a trade-off between more aggressive (slowly decaying) schedules for \u03b7 and the underlying uncertainty. Specifically, the first (deterministic) term of (19) is decreasing in \u03b7 while the second (stochastic) one increases with \u03b7. Hence, in the absence of noise, it is better to use a large, constant \u03b7 instead of letting \u03b7(t)\u2192 0; however, a constant \u03b7 may be detrimental under uncertainty. These considerations can be illustrated by choosing a specific heating schedule of the form \u03b7(t) \u223c 1/ta for some a \u2208 (0, 1); in this case, we obtain the explicit convergence rate:\nCorollary 1. Assume that (SBR) is run with \u03b7(t) \u223c 1/ta for some a \u2208 (0, 1). Then:\nC\u0304(t) = C\u2217 +  O(1/ta) if 0 < a < 12 , O ( \u221a log log t/t ) if a = 1/2,\nO(1/t1\u2212a) if 12 < a < 1.\n(21)\nProof: Simply note that tmax{a\u22121,\u2212a} is the dominant term in (19) for all a , 1/2. Otherwise, for a = 1/2, the first\ntwo terms of (19) are both O(t\u22121/2) and are dominated by the third.\nTheorem 2 and Corollary 1 make no assumptions for the underlying network or the magnitude of the stochastic perturbations affecting the system. However, the convergence they provide is in terms of the long-term average consumption C\u0304(t), not the instantaneous network state X(t). As a matter of fact, in the presence of disturbances, X(t) cannot converge with positive probaibility to a fully-mixing state x\u2217 where a given source node utilizes several paths concurrently: even if x\u2217 is a rest point of (BR), the noise term (18b) does not vanish at x\u2217, so x\u2217 cannot be stationary\n14\nunder (SBR). On the other hand, if (CM) admits a strict, non-mixing solution x\u2217 (so each source node utilizes a single path at Nash equilibrium; cf. Definition 1), we show below that Boltzmann routing converges to x\u2217 independently of the magnitude of the noise:\nTheorem 3. Assume that the global minimization problem (CM) admits a strict, non-mixing solution x\u2217. If (SBR) is run with sufficiently small (constant) \u03b7, X(t) converges to x\u2217 (a.s.).\nRemark 4. We should note here that if x\u2217 is a strict, non-mixing solution of (CM), it is the only solution of (CM); as such, Theorem 3 shows that Boltzmann routing converges (a.s.) to the network\u2019s unique globally efficient state.\nThe proof of Theorem 3 is fairly complicated, so we relegate it to Appendix D. In a nutshell, it consists of showing that a) if X(t) remains close to x\u2217 for all time, it is eventually attracted to it; and b) X(t) gets trapped in arbitrarily small neighborhoods of x\u2217 with controllably high probability (a much harder result which relies on an application of Girsanov\u2019s theorem [19, 20] to estimate the probability that a Wiener process with positive drift attains a given negative level in finite time).\nFrom a practical viewpoint, the importance of Theorem 3 is that it provides a global convergence result for constant (but small) \u03b7, irrespective of the noise level. This relaxes even further the \u201cvanishing \u03b7\u201d requirement of Theorem 2 and is owed to the existence of a strict, non-mixing solution. On the flip side, if the network does not admit such a solution, X(t) cannot converge with positive probability \u2013 even though the long-term average consumption C\u0304(t) does. Our next result shows that if the network admits an (isolated) interior solution x\u2217, learning with sufficiently small \u03b7 allows X(t) to remain arbitrarily close to x\u2217 with arbitrarily high probability:\nTheorem 4. Let x\u2217 \u2208 int(X ) be an isolated, interior solution of (CM). Then, for all \u03b5, \u03b4 > 0, the scheme (SBR) can be run with a sufficiently small (constant) parameter \u03b7 \u2261 \u03b7(\u03b5, \u03b4) such that\n(\u2016X(t) \u2212 x\u2217\u2016 \u2264 \u03b4 for all sufficiently large t) \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b5. (22)\nTheorem 4 implies that if the inverse temperature \u03b7 of (SBR) is small enough, then, after a certain amount of time, the system will be arbitrarily close to equilibrium with probability arbitrarily close to one. Thus, even though the network\u2019s state does not converge almost surely, it will still spend most of the time close to equilibrium.\nV. Numerical Results\nIn this section, we assess the performance of the proposed Boltzmann routing scheme in practical scenarios via numerical simulations. For clarity, we only present here a representative subset of these results but our conclusions apply to a wide range of optical network parameters and specifications.\nOur setup is as follows (for an overview, see Table I): we consider an optical network deployed over the continental US with nodes and links as in Fig. 1 (for clarity, we only plotted the 50 largest metropolitan areas) [49]. At each link, data is transmitted over 80 wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) channels spaced at 50 GHz, each with a carrying capacity of 10 Gb/s. To mitigate signal losses, each link carries an amplifier per 80 km of fiber length,\n15\nand an additional amplifier at each end; in addition to the amplifiers, power is also consumed at the transponder and switch port levels (cf. Table I) [28]. Source nodes are drawn randomly in the network, each with a traffic rate between 200 Gb/s and 400 Gb/s; this traffic is then directed to a set of data centers, also drawn randomly from the network\u2019s nodes. Each data center has a capacity of 2 Tb/s and consumes between 6.6 kW and 13.2 kW, at zero and full load respectively [27]; for diversity, we also populate the network with a number of \u201clegacy\u201d data centers with lower capacity and higher power consumption specifications as indicated in [50].\nIn Fig. 2, we examine the performance of the proposed Boltzmann routing scheme in terms of power consumption, convergence speed and scalability. Specifically, we consider several different structures for the source nodes\u2019 choice sets As: a) taking the shortest path to the closest destination (|As| = 1); b) splitting traffic over the 4 paths with the lowest hop count to the closest destination (|As| = 4); c) splitting traffic to the 5 closest destinations over shortest paths (|As| = 5); and d) mixing shortest paths and closest destinations (|As| = 4 \u00d7 5). We then run the Boltzmann routing scheme (BR) with the Pigouvian pricing scheme of Proposition 3 (\u03c0e = c\u2032e), a heating schedule of the form \u03b7(t) \u223c t\u22121/2 and all scores initialized uniformly at Y(0) = 0 (of course, in the single-path, single-destination case, there is nothing to learn).\nAs shown in Fig. 2(a), Boltzmann routing converges very rapidly (within a few iterations) to a socially efficient network state that solves the corresponding consumption minimization problem (CM). Moreover, we see that splitting traffic over several data centers (as opposed to exclusively targeting the closest data center) leads to significant performance gains, of the order of 100 kW/(Gb/s) \u2013 approximately a 40% decrease in power consumption with respect to closest-destination routing. Finally, in Fig. 2(b), we examine the scalability of these performance gains as the number of source nodes increases: in so doing, we observe that a) the relative percentage gain of splitting traffic over multiple data centers becomes more prominent for large numbers of sources; and b) the Boltzmann routing scheme retains its convergence speed and attains a socially efficient state within 4\u20135 iterations, even for S = 100 source nodes. This means that, in the presence of intermittent traffic fluctuations, the system will be capable of adapting fast enough to changes in the system.\nIn Fig. 3, we examine the algorithm\u2019s robustness in the presence of stochastic fluctuations and capacity constraints. First, in Fig. 3(a), we consider a network with S = 50 source nodes and D = 10 data centers with power consumption and capacity attributes as in Table I. We further assume that consumption costs are subject to stochastic disturbances\n16\nand noise with volatility coefficient \u03c3\u2217 equal to a fraction z of the costs\u2019 mean value (ranging between 0% and 100%). Remarkably, Boltzmann routing reaches a socially efficient state even under high degrees of uncertainty (up to z = 100%); however, as could be expected, the algorithm\u2019s convergence speed decreases in the presence of large disturbances.\nFinally, in Fig. 3(b), we examine the behavior of Boltzmann routing with respect to the capacity constraints imposed by the network\u2019s links and data centers. Specifically, we run (SBR) for different routing modes (cf. Fig. 2) with a 25% disturbance level and we record the number of links and/or data centers that exceed capacity at any given time. The results are plotted in the box-and-whisker charts of Fig. 3(b) which show that routing to a single destination (over a single or several paths) consistently leads to relatively high violation percentages, between 30% and 40%. On the other hand, except for a few outliers, splitting traffic over several paths and destinations yields a much lower capacity\n17\nviolation percentage, of the order of 5% (a result which is statistically significant within 5 interquartile ranges). This behavior stems from the fact that the Pigouvian pricing scheme of Proposition 3 also penalizes users when a link (or data center) approaches capacity because the slope of the \u03b5-adjusted cost function c\u03b5e is equal to 1/\u03b5 in that case (in our simulations, we took \u03b5 = 10\u22124; recall also the relevant discussion in Section II-B).\nVI. Conclusions and Perspectives\nThe prolific increase of traffic in optical networks is forcing network operators to seek energy-efficient routing methods while facing capacity limits and random fluctuations. This paper is an attempt to propose such a scheme: specifically, we analyzed a distributed approach for energy-efficient routing in optical data networks based on the implementation of a Pigouvian pricing scheme and a learning method derived from the Boltzmann distribution of statistical mechanics. The Nash equilibria of the proposed pricing scheme coincide with the network\u2019s socially optimum states (in terms of total energy consumption), and the resulting Boltzmann routing method converges to such states exponentially fast in realistic network conditions, leading to gains of up to 40% in energy consumption over simple, shortest-path routing schemes.\nMotivated by the highly volatile nature of traffic and power consumption in optical networks, we also examine the behavior of Boltzmann routing in the presence of uncertainty and random disturbances. In this regard, we showed that the network\u2019s long-term average consumption converges within \u03b5 of its minimum value in time which is at most O\u0303(\u03b5\u22122), irrespective of the fluctuations\u2019 magnitude. Moreover, if the network admits a strict, non-mixing optimum state, the network\u2019s state converges to it almost surely (again, no matter the noise level); instead, if the network admits an interior, fully-mixing optimum state, the proposed scheme remains arbitrarily close to the said state with probability arbitrarily close to 1, provided that the scheme\u2019s inverse temperature parameter \u03b7 is taken sufficiently small. These theoretical results were complemented by extensive numerical simulations showing that, in realistic network conditions, Boltzmann routing provides significant advantages over closest-destination/shortest-path routing choices. In addition, the proposed method scales up to hundreds of source nodes with minimal impact on its convergence speed, and it respects the network\u2019s capacity constraints, even under very high degrees of volatility and uncertainty.\nThe results presented in this paper apply to a wide range of congestion-limited network scenarios, ranging from latency minimization and throughput maximization in data networks to urban traffic management in road networks; the detailed analysis of these applications is relegated to future work. Additionally, a key question that arises is what happens in the presence of non-zero-mean fluctuations (random or not), which could lead the system\u2019s optimum/equilibrium states to evolve over time in an arbitrary fashion (so there is no fixed underlying state to target). In this case, efficient routing protocols would have to be capable of tracking the system\u2019s evolving optimum state in a flexible, dynamic manner; we intend to explore this issue in future work.\nAppendix A\nPreliminary Results\nFor simplicity, in what follows, we take all rates equal to %s = 1; this assumption is only done for notational clarity and does not otherwise affect our results. For posterity, define also the Gibbs map y 7\u2192 G(y) with G\u03b1(y) =\n18\nexp(y\u03b1)/ \u2211 \u03b2\u223c\u03b1 exp(y\u03b2), so the update step of (BR) can be written as x = G(y). Finally, with a fair degree of hindsight,\nintroduce the (negative) entropy function h(x) = \u2211 \u03b1\u2208A x\u03b1 log x\u03b1, x \u2208 X , and its convex conjugate [34]\nh\u2217(y) = max x\u2208X {\u3008y|x\u3009 \u2212 h(x)} = \u2211 s\u2208S log \u2211 \u03b1\u2208As ey\u03b1 , y \u2208 A. (A.1)\nThen, an easy differentiation shows that G(y) = \u2207h\u2217(y) and, furthermore, for all \u03b2, \u03b3 \u223c \u03b1: \u2202G\u03b1 \u2202x\u03b2 = x\u03b1(\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 x\u03b2), \u22022G\u03b1 \u2202x\u03b2\u2202x\u03b3 = x\u03b1(\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 x\u03b2)(\u03b4\u03b2\u03b3 \u2212 2x\u03b2), (A.2) where \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 denote Kronecker\u2019s delta symbols. With these preliminaries at hand, we have:\nProof of Proposition 4: Applying It\u00f4\u2019s formula [19, 20] to the dynamics (SBR), we get:\ndX\u03b1 = \u03b7 \u2211 \u03b2\u223c\u03b1 \u2202G\u03b1 \u2202x\u03b2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b7Y dY\u03b2 + \u03b7\u0307 \u2211 \u03b2\u223c\u03b1 Y\u03b2 \u2202G\u03b1 \u2202x\u03b2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b7Y dt + \u03b72 2 \u2211 \u03b2,\u03b3\u223c\u03b1 \u22022G\u03b1 \u2202x\u03b2\u2202x\u03b3 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b7Y dY\u03b2 \u00b7 dY\u03b3. (A.3)\nThe system (18) is then obtained by substituting dY from (SBR), using the stochastic differential multiplication formula (16) and the derivative calculations (A.2) above; this a straightforward algebraic manipulation, so we leave the details to the reader.\nTo continue, we will require a further piece of technical machinery that will act as a Lyapunov function for the\ndynamics (BR) / (SBR). Specifically, following [43, 48], consider the so-called Fenchel coupling\nF(x, y) = h(x) + h\u2217(y) \u2212 \u3008y|x\u3009. (A.4)\nBy the convexity of h, F(x, y) is convex in both x and y; furthermore, by Fenchel\u2019s inequality [34], we have F(x, y) \u2265 0 with equality if and only if x = \u2207h\u2217(y), i.e. if and only if x = G(y). Moreover, using the explicit log-sum-exp formula (A.1), it is easy to see that\nF(x, y) = DKL(x,G(y)) for all x \u2208 X , y \u2208 A. (A.5)\nAs a result, for fixed x\u2217 \u2208 X , we will have x(t)\u2192 x\u2217 if and only if F(x\u2217, y(t))\u2192 0. With this in mind, we turn to the behavior of F under (SBR):\nLemma A.1. Let Y(t) be given by (SBR). Then, for all x\u2217 \u2208 X , we have:\ndF(x\u2217,Y) = \u2211\n\u03b1 (X\u03b1 \u2212 x\u2217\u03b1) dY\u03b1 + 1 2 \u2211 \u03b1 X\u03b1 ( \u03c32\u03b1\u03b1 \u2212 \u2211 \u03b2\u223c\u03b1 X\u03b2\u03c32\u03b1\u03b2 ) dt (A.6)\nProof: Simply apply It\u00f4\u2019s lemma [19, 20] to F(x\u2217,Y(t)) and use the differentiation formula (A.2) to rewrite\n\u2202\u03b1\u2202\u03b2h\u2217(y) = \u2202\u03b2G\u03b1(y) in terms of x; the details are straightforward and are left to the reader.\nFinally, we will require the following growth estimate for martingales with bounded volatility:\nLemma A.2. Let W(t) be a Wiener process in n and let Z(t) be a bounded, continuous process in n. Then, for every positive function f such that f (t)/ \u221a t log log t \u2192 \u221e as t \u2192 \u221e, we have:\nf (t) + \u222b t\n0 Z(s) \u00b7 dW(s) \u223c f (t) as t \u2192 \u221e (a.s.). (A.7)\n19\nProof: Let \u03be(t) = \u2211n\ni=1 \u222b t 0 Zi(s) dWi(s). Then, the quadratic variation \u03c1 = [\u03be, \u03be] of \u03be satisfies\nd[\u03be, \u03be] = d\u03be \u00b7 d\u03be = \u2211n\ni=1 ZiZ j\u03b4i j dt \u2264 M dt, (A.8)\nwhere M = supt\u22650\u2016Z(t)\u20162 < \u221e. By the time-change theorem for martingales [19, Cor. 8.5.4], there exists a Wiener process W\u0303(t) such that \u03be(t) = W\u0303(\u03c1(t)), so [ f (t) + \u03be(t)]/ f (t) = 1 + W\u0303(\u03c1(t))/ f (t). If limt\u2192\u221e \u03c1(t) < \u221e, we have lim supt\u2192\u221e|W\u0303(\u03c1(t))| < \u221e (a.s.); otherwise, if limt\u2192\u221e \u03c1(t) = \u221e, our claim follows from the law of the iterated logarithm [19] and the fact that \u03c1(t) \u2264 Mt.\nAppendix B\nDeterministic Analysis\nProof of Theorem 1: Let x(t) be an interior solution orbit of the Boltzmann routing dynamics (BR) and let X \u2217 = arg min C denote the solution set of (CM). By Lemma A.1 and the convexity of the objective function C, it follows that the function V(t) = F(x\u2217, y(t)) is decreasing for any x\u2217 \u2208 X \u2217, so Lyapunov\u2019s theorem ensures that x(t) = G(y(t)) converges to X \u2217 (note here that all stochastic terms in (A.6) vanish when \u03c3 = 0). Assume now that x(t) has two distinct \u03c9-limit points x\u2217, x\u2217\u2217 \u2208 X \u2217 such that x(tn)\u2192 x\u2217 and x(t\u2032n)\u2192 x\u2217\u2217 for two time sequences tn, t\u2032n \u2197 \u221e. It then follows that F(x\u2217, y(tn))\u2192 0 and F(x\u2217\u2217, y(t\u2032n))\u2192 0; however, with both F(x\u2217, y(t)) and F(x\u2217\u2217, y(t)) decreasing, we obtain lim F(x\u2217, y(t)) = lim F(x\u2217\u2217, y(t)) = 0. This only holds if x\u2217 = x\u2217\u2217, so we conclude that x(t) has a unique \u03c9-limit.\nAppendix C\nConvergence of Long-Term Averages\nProof of Theorem 2: Let x\u2217 be a solution of (CM) and consider the \u03b7-deflated Fenchel coupling\nH \u2261 1 \u03b7 F(x\u2217, \u03b7Y) = 1 \u03b7 \u00b7 [h(x\u2217) + h\u2217(\u03b7Y) \u2212 \u3008\u03b7Y |x\u2217\u3009] . (C.1)\nThen, the It\u00f4 formula of Lemma A.1 readily gives:\ndH = \u2212 \u03b7\u0307 \u03b7 H dt + \u03b7\u0307 \u03b7 \u3008Y |X \u2212 x\u2217\u3009 dt + \u3008dY |X \u2212 x\u2217\u3009 + \u03b7 2 \u2211 \u03b2 \u22022h\u2217\n\u2202y2\u03b2 \u03c32\u03b2 dt. (C.2)\nHence, letting v = \u2212\u03c0 and combining the definition of H with the dynamics (SBR), we get:\ndH = \u2212 \u03b7\u0307 \u03b72\n[ h(x\u2217) \u2212 h(X)] dt + \u3008v|X \u2212 x\u2217\u3009dt + \u2211\n\u03b2 (X\u03b2 \u2212 x\u2217\u03b2)\u03c3\u03b2 dW\u03b2 +\n\u03b7 2 \u2211 \u03b2 \u22022h\u2217\n\u2202y2\u03b2 \u03c32\u03b2 dt, (C.3)\nwhere we used the fact that h\u2217(\u03b7Y) = \u3008\u03b7Y |X\u3009 \u2212 h(X). Thus, after rearranging and integrating:\u222b t 0 \u3008v(s)|x\u2217 \u2212 X(s)\u3009 ds = H(0) \u2212 H(t) (C.4a)\n\u2212 \u222b t\n0\n\u03b7\u0307(s) \u03b72(s)\n[ h(x\u2217) \u2212 h(X(s))] ds (C.4b)\n+ \u2211\n\u03b2 \u222b t 0 (X\u03b2(s) \u2212 x\u2217)\u03c3\u03b2(s) dW\u03b2(s) (C.4c)\n+ 1 2 \u2211 \u03b2 \u222b t 0 \u03b7(s) \u22022h\u2217 \u2202y2\u03b2 \u03c32\u03b2(s) ds. (C.4d)\n20\nWe now proceed to bound each term of (C.4):\na) Since H \u2265 0, the term (C.4a) is bounded from above as follows:\nH(0) \u2264 h(x \u2217) + h\u2217(Y(0)) \u03b7(0) = h(x\u2217) \u2212minx\u2208X h(x) \u03b7(0) + O(1) = \u2211 s log As \u03b7(0) + O(1). (C.5)\nb) For (C.4b), we have h(x\u2217) \u2212 h(X(s)) \u2264 \u2211s log As by definition; hence, with \u03b7\u0307 \u2264 0, we get: (C.4b) \u2264 \u2212 \u2211 s log As \u222b t 0 \u03b7\u0307(s) \u03b72(s) ds = \u2211 s log As ( 1 \u03b7(t) \u2212 1 \u03b7(0) ) . (C.6)\nc) By Lemma A.2 and the law of the iterated logarithm, (C.4c) is bounded from above by 2\u03c32\u2217 \u221a t log log t. d) Finally, using the derivative calculations (A.2) for \u22022\u03b2h \u2217(y) = \u2202\u03b2G\u03b2(y), we immediately deduce that (C.4d) is\nbounded from above by 12\u03c3 2 \u2217 \u222b t 0 \u03b7(s) ds.\nThe bound (19) then follows by recalling that v = \u2212\u03c0 = \u2212\u2202c, integrating the convexity relation C(X(t)) \u2264 C\u2217 + \u3008v(X(t))|x\u2217 \u2212 X(t)\u3009, and combining the above terms.\nAppendix D\nConvergence to Non-Mixing Optimum States\nTo prove Theorem 3 we will need a series of auxiliary results. We begin by showing that neighborhoods of a strict,\nnon-mixing optimum state are recurrent under (SBR):\nProposition D.1. Let x\u2217 be a strict, non-mixing optimum state of (CM). If \u03b7 is chosen sufficiently small, there exists a (random) sequence of times tn \u2197 \u221e such that \u2016X(tn) \u2212 x\u2217\u2016 < \u03b4 (a.s.).\nProof: Suppose there exists some t0 such that \u2016X(t) \u2212 x\u2217\u2016 \u2265 \u03b4 for all t \u2265 t0. Then, (C.3) yields H(t) = H(t0) + \u222b t\nt0 \u3008v(X(s))|X(s) \u2212 x\u2217\u3009 ds + \u03b7 2 \u222b t t0 \u22022h\u2217 \u2202y2\u03b2 \u03c32\u03b2 ds + \u03be(t)\n\u2264 H(t0) \u2212 \u00b5\u03b4(t \u2212 t0) + \u03b7\u03c32\n2K (t \u2212 t0) + \u03be(t) \u2264 H(t0) \u2212\n( \u00b5\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b7\u03c3 2\n2K \u2212 \u03be(t) t \u2212 t0\n) (t \u2212 t0), (D.1)\nwhere, v = \u2212\u03c0 as before, and we set \u03be(t) = \u2211di=1 \u222b tt0 (Xi(s) \u2212 x\u2217i ) dZi(s), and \u00b5 = min\u03b2\u223csupp(x\u2217){v(x\u2217) \u2212 v\u03b2(x\u2217)} > 0 (recall that x\u2217 is a strict equilibrium). By Lemma A.2, it follows that \u03be(t)/t \u2192 0 (a.s.), so the above estimate yields limt\u2192\u221e H(t) = \u2212\u221e if \u03b7\u03c32 < 2\u00b5\u03b4K, a contradiction (recall that H(t) \u2265 0 for all t \u2265 0). This shows that t0 = \u221e (a.s.) and our claim follows.\nWe now show that if X(t) begins close enough to a strict equilibrium x\u2217, then it remains nearby and eventually\nconverges with arbitrarily high probability:\nProposition D.2. Let x\u2217 be a strict, non-mixing optimum state of (CM). Then, for every \u03b5 > 0 and for every neighborhood U0 of x\u2217 in X , there exists a neighborhood U \u2286 U0 of x\u2217 such that, if X(0) \u2208 U, then:\n(X(t) \u2208 U0 for all t \u2265 0 and limt\u2192\u221e X(t) = x\u2217) \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b5. (D.2)\n21\nProof: Write x\u2217 = (\u03b1\u22171, . . . , \u03b1 \u2217 S ) and let A\u2217s \u2261 As \\ {\u03b1\u2217s} denote the set of non-equilibrium paths of the s-th source.\nMoreover, for all \u03b1 \u2208 A\u2217s, let Z\u03b1 = \u03b7 ( Y\u03b1 \u2212 Y\u03b1\u2217s ) , (D.3)\nso that, by definition, X(t)\u2192 x\u2217 if and only if Z\u03b1(t)\u2192 \u2212\u221e for all \u03b1 \u2208 A\u2217s. With this in mind, let M > 0 be sufficiently large so that X(t) \u2208 U if Z\u03b1(t) \u2264 \u2212M for all \u03b1 \u2208 A\u2217s, and assume that\nM > \u00b5\u03b7\u03c32\u2217 log(N/\u03b5), (D.4)\nwith \u00b5 defined as in the proof of Proposition D.1. We will show that if Z\u03b1(0) \u2264 \u22122M, then X(t) \u2208 U for all t \u2265 0 and Z\u03b1(t)\u2192 \u2212\u221e with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b5.\nTo that end, let \u03c4U = inf{t > 0 : X(t) < U} denote the first exit time from U; then, for t \u2264 \u03c4U , (SBR) gives Z\u03b1(t) = Z\u03b1(0) + \u03b7 \u222b t\n0\n[ v\u03b1(X(s)) \u2212 v\u03b1\u2217s (X(s)) ] ds + \u03b7\u03bes(t) \u2264 \u22122M \u2212 \u03b7 [ \u00b5t \u2212 \u03bes(t) ] , (D.5)\nwhere we have set\n\u03bes(t) = \u222b t\n0 \u03c3\u03b1(X) dW\u03b1 \u2212 \u222b t 0 \u03c3\u03b1\u2217s (X) dW\u03b1\u2217s . (D.6)\nWe will first show that (\u03c4U < \u221e) \u2264 \u03b5. Indeed, as in the proof of Lemma A.2, there exists a rescaled Wiener process W\u0303s(t) such that \u03bes(t) = W\u0303s(\u03c1s(t)) where \u03c1s = [\u03bes, \u03bes] is the quadratic variation of \u03bes. We thus conclude that Z\u03b1(t) \u2264 \u2212M whenever \u00b5t \u2212 W\u0303s(\u03c1s(t)) \u2265 \u2212M/\u03b7. Accordingly, with \u03c1s(t) \u2264 2\u03c32\u2217 t, it suffices to show that the hitting time\n\u03c40 = inf { t > 0 : W\u0303s(t) = \u00b5t\n2\u03c32\u2217 + M \u03b7\nfor some k \u2208 k }\n(D.7)\nis finite with probability not exceeding \u03b5.\nNow, if a trajectory of W\u0303s has W\u0303s(t) \u2264 \u00b5t/(2\u03c32\u2217 ) + M/\u03b7 for all t \u2265 0, we also get\nW\u0303s(\u03c1s(t)) \u2264 \u00b5\u03c1s(t) 2\u03c32\u2217 + M \u03b7 \u2264 \u00b5t + M \u03b7 , (D.8)\nso \u03c4U is infinite whenever \u03c40 is infinite. Thus, if we write Es for the event that W\u0303s(t) \u2265 \u00b5t/(2\u03c32\u2217 ) + M/\u03b7 for some finite t \u2265 0, the hitting-time estimate [51, p. 197] for a Brownian motion with drift yields (Es) = e\u2212\u03bbs M with \u03bbs = \u00b5/(\u03b7\u03c32\u2217 ). Therefore, by construction of M, we obtain:\n(\u03c40 < +\u221e) = (\u22c3\ns Es\n) \u2264 \u2211 s (Es) = \u2211 s e\u2212\u03bbs M \u2264 \u03b5. (D.9)\nBy Lemma A.2, Eq. (D.5) then yields Z\u03b1(t) \u2264 \u22122M\u2212\u03b7 [ \u00b5t\u2212\u03bes(t) ] \u223c \u2212\u03b7\u00b5t \u2192 \u2212\u221e (a.s.).We conclude that Z\u03b1(t)\u2192 \u2212\u221e for all \u03b1 \u2208 A\u2217s, so limt\u2192\u221e X(t) = x\u2217, as claimed.\nWith all this at hand, we are finally in a position to prove Theorem 3:\nProof of Theorem 3: By Proposition D.1, if \u03b7 is chosen sufficiently small, X(t) will visit any neighborhood U of x\u2217 infinitely often. Thus, if \u03b5 > 0 is fixed and U is chosen as in the statement of Proposition D.2, X(t) will stay in U and converge to x\u2217 with probality exceeding 1 \u2212 \u03b5. Since X(t) is recurrent, the probability that X(t) exits and then re-enters U for a strictly positive amount of time at least n times does not exceed \u03b5n. Our claim then follows by taking n\u2192 \u221e.\n22\nAppendix E\nConcentration near Interior Optimum States\nProof of Theorem 4: Assume that x\u2217 is an isolated interior solution of (CM) and define H(t) = \u03b7\u22121F(x\u2217, \u03b7Y(t)) as in the proof of Theorem 3. Then, taking a sufficiently small B > 0 such that C(x)\u2212C(x\u2217) \u2265 12 B\u2016x\u2212 x\u2217\u2016 2 (recall that x\u2217 is an isolated, interior minimum point), (C.4) yields\nH(t) \u2264 H(0) \u2212 1 2\nB \u222b t\n0 \u2016X(t) \u2212 x\u2217\u20162 ds + \u03b7 2 \u03c32\u2217 t + \u03be(t), (E.1)\nwhere the martingale term \u03be(t) is defined as in the proof of Proposition D.1. Thus, dividing by t and taking expectations yields the bound\n[ 1 t \u222b t 0 \u2016X(s) \u2212 x\u2217\u2016 ds ] \u2264 \u03b7\u03c3 2 \u2217 B + H(0) t . (E.2)\nOur goal will be to show that X(t) admits an invariant measure which can be estimated from the above bound to yield (22).\nTo that end, consider the process \u03a8(X(t)) where \u03a8s\u03b2(x) = log(xs\u03b2/xs\u03b1) = Ys\u03b2 \u2212 Ys\u03b1 for some fixed \u03b1 \u2208 As, \u03b2 \u223c \u03b1, s \u2208 S. It\u00f4\u2019s formula then yields:\nd\u03a8\u03b2 = dY\u03b2 \u2212 dY\u03b1 = L\u03a8\u03b2(X) dt + \u2211\ne \u03a0\u2032e\u03b2\u03c3e dWe, (E.3)\nwhere L\u03a8 denotes the deterministic part of (D.5) and \u03a0\u2032e\u03b2 = \u03a0e\u03b2 \u2212 \u03a0e\u03b1 (the source index s has been dropped for convenience). Following [40], we claim that the infinitesimal generator of \u03a8 is (uniformly) elliptic [19, 20]. For this,\nlet A\u03b2e = \u03a0\u2032e\u03b2\u03c3e, \u03b2 \u2208 \u2210 s A\u2217s denote the coefficient matrix of the martingale term of (E.3); then, it suffices to show that the matrix AAT is positive-definite on X . Indeed, for all z \u2208 TCX (x\u2217), we have:\n\u3008Az, Az\u3009 = \u2211\n\u03b2,\u03b3 \u2211 e \u03a0\u2032e\u03b2\u03a0 \u2032 e\u03b3\u03c3 2 ez\u03b2z\u03b3 = \u2211 e \u03c32e(\u03a0 \u2032z)2e > 0, (E.4)\nbecause \u03a0\u2032 is necessarily invertible on X (otherwise x\u2217 would not be isolated). This proves our ellipticity assertion, so [52, Lemma 3.4] shows that \u03a8 is recurrent.\nSince \u03a8 is recurrent, it follows that X(t) is also recurrent; consequently, the transition probabilities of X(t) converge in total variation to an invariant probability measure \u03bd on X [20, 53]. Thus, if B\u03b4 is a \u03b4-ball centered at x\u2217, ergodicity\ngives \u03bd(B\u03b4) = limt\u2192\u221e x [ 1 t \u222b t 0 \u03c7B\u03b4 (X(s)) ds ] , where \u03c7B\u03b4 is the indicator function of B\u03b4.\nNow, with \u2016x \u2212 x\u2217\u2016 \u2265 \u03b4 outside B\u03b4, we readily obtain [ 1 t \u222b t 0 \u03c7B\u03b4 (X(s)) ds ] \u2265 [ 1 t \u222b t 0 ( 1 \u2212 \u2016X(s) \u2212 x\u2217\u20162/\u03b42 ) ds ] . (E.5) Thus, letting t \u2192 \u221e in (E.2), we get \u03bd(B\u03b4) \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b7\u03c32\u2217 /(B\u03b42). Taking \u03b7 sufficiently small, this bound can be assumed greater than or equal to 1 \u2212 \u03b5; our assertion then follows from the convergence in total variation of the transition probabilities of X(t) to the invariant measure \u03bd.\n23\nReferences\n[1] P.

provisioning, we examine the problem of routing in optical networks with the aim of minimizing traffic-driven power consumption. To tackle this issue, routing must take into account energy efficiency as well as capacity considerations; moreover, in rapidly-varying network environments, this must be accomplished in a real-time, distributed manner that remains robust in the presence of random disturbances and noise. In view of this, we derive a pricing scheme whose Nash equilibria coincide with the network\u2019s socially optimum states, and we propose a distributed learning method based on the Boltzmann distribution of statistical mechanics. Using tools from stochastic calculus, we show that the resulting Boltzmann routing scheme exhibits remarkable convergence properties under uncertainty: specifically, the long-term average of the network\u2019s power consumption converges within \u03b5 of its minimum value in time which is at most \u00d5(1/\u03b52), irrespective of the fluctuations\u2019 magnitude; additionally, if the network admits a strict, non-mixing optimum state, the algorithm converges to it \u2013 again, no matter the noise level. Our analysis is supplemented by extensive numerical simulations which show that Boltzmann routing can lead to a significant decrease in power consumption over basic, shortest-path routing schemes in realistic network conditions.
