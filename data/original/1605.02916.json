Experiments were conducted on a corpus of about 0.5 billion web documents in Polish language.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nRELATION extraction is a necessary step of anyontology induction or taxonomy induction task. Typically it takes as input morpho-syntactically annotated text and produces a set of triples (E1, R,E2), where E1 and E2 are entities and R is a relation in which E1 and E2 participate as a pair. In case of ontology induction or information extraction in open domain (as described, e.g., in [1], [2], [3], [4]) no restrictions are imposed on R. There are many types of relations that can be extracted this way, such as quality, part or behavior [5]. In case of taxonomy induction the main interest is in the IS-A (hyponymhypernym) relation. Approaches to IS-A extraction described in literature rely on evidence from pattern extraction and statistical information (cf. [6], [7], [8]). Pattern-based methods rely heavily on so called Hearst patterns, first described in [9]. These are ways of expressing instance enumerations of a class in natural language. Typical forms are \u201ec such as i1, i2 or i3\u201d or \u201ec, for example i1, i2 or i3\u201d. Terms extracted with such patterns may serve as input for elaborate taxonomy and ontology construction methods as, e.g., [10]. While these lexico-syntactic patterns prove quite useful, they may not capture all taxonomical relations expressed in text. Therefore in this paper we describe a novel method of IS-A relation extraction from patterns, which uses morpho-syntactical annotations along with grammatical case of noun phrases that\nThe study is cofounded by the European Union from resources of the European Social Fund.

The method is unsupervised, as it is based on hand-crafted patterns, dictionary filtering and manually adjusted support level. Precision of this method, understood as the ratio of correct extracted IS-A relations to all extracted relations is estimated using manual scoring of about 110 relations randomly selected from the method\u2019s output. Based on an internet corpus of documents, the method produces a big number of IS-A relations. Most of them (roughly 90%) occur only once in the corpus introducing a high level of noise. We show in conducted experiments that even for a slight increase of support (given as a number of occurrences), the estimated precision of this method increases strongly. We also describe a new method for increasing the number of extracted relations for any support level bigger than 1. The method is based on very simple heuristic for detection of hyponymy between class part of extracted relations, thus we call it pseudo-subclass boosting (psc in short). It is worth mentioning that this boosting approach can be applied in any pattern-based relation extraction method. Experiments were conducted on a corpus of about 0.5 billion web documents in Polish language crawled in NEKST project (http://www.nekst.pl) and maintained up to date. These include primarily HTML documents, but also other formats found on websites like PDFs and DOCs. In order to process such high volume of data it was implemented using MapReduce framework [11] implemented in Apache Hadoop project (http:// hadoop.apache.org) and Hive (http://hive.apache.org). All examples mentioned in the article are real data, taken from working instance of NEKST system."}, {"heading": "II. OUR APPROACH", "text": "It is known that languages that have inflection and free word order are much harder for automatic analysis1 than, e.g., English. As pointed out in [13, pp. 100], free word order implies non-projective grammar. It is shown in [14] and [15] that dependency parsing for non-projective grammars is NP-hard, apart from a very narrow subclass called edge-factored grammars. This challenge is addressed, among others, by transition-based dependency parsing [16]\n1See e.g. [12] for problems with relation mining in German, in which the word order is much less free than in Polish; note that they use an initial lexicon while we do start from scratch when extracting relations.\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n02 91\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n0 M\nay 2\n01 6\nused in the preprocessing step for the algorithm described in this paper. We argue that inflection in a language is not only a drawback but can also be a great advantage. Typical constructs that express the hypernymy relation explicitly in Polish language are:\nNPNom1 to NP Nom 2 , (1)\nNPNom1 jest NP Abl 2 . (2)\nBoth of them are a way of saying NP1 is NP2 and in both cases noun phrase NP1 is expressed in nominative. They differ in grammatical case of NP2, where in the first construct we have nominative and in the second: instrumental. The second pattern has its equivalent for past tense:\nNPNom1 by\u0142/by\u0142a/by\u0142o NP Abl 2 . (3)\nObviously in case of past tense construction it is possible that IS-A relation no longer holds2. The problem exists to a lesser extent also in present tense, which for example can be a consequence of outdated web documents. Assessment of correctness with respect to a given point in time is, in our opinion, a research direction of its own, thus it is out of scope of this paper.\nAs will be shown later, combination of word and grammatical case pattern allows for relation extraction with quite high precision. It is possible partially thanks to the fact that instrumental case in Polish language is regular for nouns and has unique suffixes shown is Table I (after [17, pp. 145, 148]). This makes automatic analysis of sentence tokens easy for this case.\nWe propose a rule-based approach for IS-A relation extraction with the following procedure:\n\u2022 run each sentence in corpus through POStagger and dependency parser,\n\u2022 select dependency trees with promising structure,\n\u2022 apply dictionary filtering for the head of NP2,\n\u2022 apply a set of construction rules to dependency tree in order to build instance name out of NP1 and class name out of NP2,\n\u2022 apply a set of filtering rules.\nThis method is additionally extended with a technique that we call pseudo-subclass boosting which increases the number of extracted relations.\n2The relation was valid in the past only\nIt is worth noting that automatic detection of IS-A patterns is possible. Experiments described in [18] show that hand-crafted ontologies like WordNet can be used successfully as a training set for such pattern discovery task. However, our problem setting differs from that research significantly. Apart from the already mentioned inflection challenge and free word order language, our corpus consists of about 11 billion sentences, which is four orders of magnitude more than the Reuters corpus used in [18] and imposes efficiency limitations. On the other hand, the gain in size comes at the price of quality \u2013 Internet documents tend to have much more noisy content than printed journal articles. We have no knowledge of any research on IS-A patterns detection in similar setting (that is web-scale), which leads us to first tackle a more realistic problem of extracting IS-A relations with known patterns. Nevertheless, this is a task worth trying given experience gained from research reported here."}, {"heading": "A. POS tagging and dependency parsing", "text": "For part-of-speech tagging we use the Apache OpenNLP (http://opennlp.apache.org) tagger trained with Maximum Entropy classifier on NKJP [19] corpus. Additionally, for known words, we optimized the tag disambiguation process by narrowing tags that can be chosen by information taken from the PoliMorf dictionary [20]. For Polish language, whose tagset contains around 1000 tags [21], this simple optimization gives an improvement of tagging in terms of accuracy and processing speed at the same time. To give an example, the word artyku\u0142\u00f3w (inflected form of the word article) has only two possible tags subst:pl:gen:m3 and subst:pl:gen:p3. Using this knowledge in OpenNLP tagger reduces search space for this word 500 times. Dependency parsing is based on MaltParser framework [22] trained on Polish Dependency Bank that consists of 8030 sentences [23]. To obtain high processing speed (essential for such large volume of text data) the liblinear classification model has been used."}, {"heading": "B. Promising dependency tree structure selection", "text": "By promising structure of a dependency tree we mean one that matches any of the patterns depicted in Figures 1, 2 and 3, where form, dep and pos mean: token form, dependency relation type (as described in [23]) and part-of-speech tag (as described in [19]) respectively.\nIn both nominative and instrumental case, the base structure has a predicate word with outgoing dependency arcs to two other words with subjective and predicative complement relation type. The difference between structure 1, 2 and 3 is in the grammatical case of the predicative complement and part of speech of the predicate. Our intuition is that selected structures are natural sources of IS-A relation. This claim is supported by the estimated precision obtained in conducted experiments.\nFigure 4 illustrates an example of sentence that matches pattern 2, parsed with our dependency parser and printed in CoNLL [24] format. It is worth noting that in this case the part-of-speech tagger made an error in assigning a case to the adjective mys\u0301liwski (hunting), where instrumental instead of locative should appear. This may happen because singular masculine adjective suffixes for instrumental (as noted in [17, p. 160]) are not unique as with nouns. That\u2019s why in our analysis we focus only on the grammatical case of the head of noun phrase and assume the same case for its dependent adjective tokens. This assumption is justified by the fact, that for Polish language agreement exists between noun and adjective in a noun phrase [25, p. 174]. POS tag in the example is repeated twice because CoNLL format specifies CPOSTAG and POSTAG allowing for coarse-grained and fine-grained part-of-speech tagsets which are the same for Polish language. The following steps illustrate how pattern 2 applies to the example sentence from figure 4:\n\u2022 find a root word of the sentence (jest in our case), and check its dependency relation (must be pred) and a POS tag (must be fin),\n\u2022 if the root word has two descendants, then test if: \u25e6 its left descendant (golden) has correct\ndependency relation (must be subj) and a POS tag (must be subst), \u25e6 its right descendant (pies) has correct dependency relation (must be pd) and a POS tag (must be subst:inst),\n\u2022 if all requirements are fulfilled, the sentence is moved to the phase of dictionary filtering (section II-C) and instance and class name construction (section II-D).\nGiven a sentence whose dependency tree matches one of above-mentioned patterns, we construct NP1 from its left sub-tree and NP2 from its right subtree. Head (or root) of left and right sub-tree will be denoted NH1 and N H 2 respectively.\nC. Dictionary filtering for the head of NP2\nPreliminary experiments showed that many of sentences matching constructs (1) and (2) contain very general, ambiguous nouns in NP2 like problem, aspect, element or outcome. Those nouns cannot be considered proper classes in the sense of IS-A relation, rather they are catch-all phrases used to express various thoughts about what is contained in NP1.\nWe eliminated those nouns by manually evaluating a random sample of about 1000 experiment results and creating a dictionary of such meaningless \u201eclasses\u201d. In this step of our extraction procedure we filter extractions with this dictionary. This process was repeated in three iterations. Size of the dictionary started with 95 catch-all phrases increased by 50, and 20 reaching the level of about 170.\nD. Construction rules for NP1 and NP2\nWe construct both instance name (from NP1) and class name (from NP2) out of lemmatized tokens. The first step is to serialize tokens present in both dependency sub-trees with operators leftOffspring and rightOffspring, which operate as follows:\n1) put all nodes of dependency sub-tree in a list L, 2) sort L by CoNLL token id descending (for leftOffspring operator)/ascending (for rightOffspring operator), 3) find index iH of sub-tree head in L, 4) create sub-list L\u2032 from iH to the first occurrence of interpunction or end of L, 5) in case of leftOffspring: sort L\u2032 by CoNLL token id ascending, 6) concatenate lemmas of tokens in L\u2032 and\nreturn.\nComputational complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the sentence length. Actual sorting of tokens in case of steps 2. and 5. is not necessary and was introduced to simplify the description3. Boundaries detection of instance name is quite simple because it is typically directly defined by left sub-tree of all considered dependency structures (fig. 1, 2 and\n3It unifies the procedure for left and right part of the sentence.\n3). Therefore it is constructed as concatenation:\nleftOffspring(NH1 ) +N H 1 + rightOffspring(N H 1 )\nCreation of class name is more complicated as it is often preceded by degrees of comparison and followed by the rest of the sentence which may be loosely coupled with the class itself. Consider the following sentences:\nTr\u00f3jmorski Wierch jest jedyna\u0328 polska\u0328 g\u00f3ra\u0328, z kt\u00f3rej sp\u0142ywaja\u0328 wody az\u0307 do trzech m\u00f3rz.\n(Tr\u00f3jmorski Wierch is the only Polish mountain, from which waters flow to as many as three seas.)\nKorona norweska to waluta oznaczana mie\u0328dzynarodowym kodem \u2013 NOK.\n(Norwegian krone is a currency marked with the international code \u2013 NOK.)\nIn the first example, the word jedyna\u0328 (the only) cannot be considered as part of class name. Likewise, anything that comes after word waluta (currency) in the second example is merely a description of Norwegian krone, not part of a class name. To address such issues construction rules for class name simply omit the output of leftOffspring operator and truncate rightOffspring output: it is iterated from left to right only as long as the tokens have POS tag from set {adj, subst, ger} and dependency type from set {adjunct, app, conjunct, obj}. So the class name results from concatenating:\nNH2 + truncate(rightOffspring(N H 2 ))\nThis forces extraction of shorter phrases, which increases the probability of observing a given instanceclass pair more than once. As we show in section III, this highly influences the precision of the method. Extraction results for above examples are: Tr\u00f3jmorski Wierch IS-A g\u00f3ra [Tr\u00f3jmorski Wierch IS-A mountain] and Korona norweska IS-A waluta [Norvegian crown IS-A currency], while from such sentence:\nNarodowy Bank Belgijski jest bankiem centralnym od 1850 roku.4\nwe acquire Narodowy Bank Belgijski IS-A bank centralny [Belgian National Bank IS-A central bank].\n4Belgian National Bank is the central bank since 1850."}, {"heading": "E. Final filtering rules", "text": "It is common that NP1 contains reference to earlier parts of text. Two types of such reference can be distinguished:\n1) explicit: Ten wikipedysta jest numizmatykiem.5\n2) implicit: Pisarka jest cz\u0142onkiem Zwia\u0328zku Pis-\narzy Bia\u0142orusi.6\nIn both cases NP1 typically contains a class of referenced entity, not the entity itself which leads to erroneous extractions. As long as this reference is explicit, we filter such cases with a dictionary of referencing words (pronouns and textual references like above-mentioned). The case where reference is implicit is much harder, and at this point left for further research, as described later in section VI."}, {"heading": "F. Pseudo-subclass (psc) boosting", "text": "Our experiments showed that the number of extracted relations drops significantly with increase of support level t. To compensate this loss we designed a boosting method that is based on the following intuition: if I IS-A C and I IS-A C\u2019 are extracted relations and C is a substring of C\u2019, then there is high chance that C\u2019 is a way of describing I more precisely than C, i.e., C\u2019 is a pseudo-subclass of C. If so, we can boost our confidence in the fact that I IS-A C is properly extracted. To give an example:\nKrak\u00f3w to najche\u0328tniej odwiedzane miasto przez turyst\u00f3w w Polsce. Krak\u00f3w \u2013 dawna stolica Polak\u00f3w jest miastem magicznym.7\nAbove two sentences allow for boosting confidence in extraction Krak\u00f3w IS-A miasto (Cracow ISA city). From the first sentence we get the relation Krak\u00f3w IS-A miasto and from the second Krak\u00f3w IS-A miasto magiczne (Cracow IS-A magic city). As \"miasto magiczne\" is a superstring of \"miasto\", the second sentence supports the first extracted relation. In general, to detect class/pseudo-subclass matches for each extraction R = I IS-A C we generate a list L of\n\u2022 prefix lists of tokens from C,\n5This wikipedian is a numismatist. 6The writer is a member of Union of Belarus Writers. 7Cracow is the most visited city by tourists in Poland.

EXPERIMENTS", "text": "Experiments were conducted on a corpus of about 0.5 billion web documents in Polish language with roughly 11 billion sentences. Tables II, III and V present the results of passing the entire collection through the algorithm described in section II.\nMethod evaluation was conducted for four levels of the value of t, which, as earlier described, is the minimal IS-A relation occurrence count acceptance threshold. Precision evaluation was based on manual scoring of about 110 randomly selected relations from given experiment\u2019s results. Estimated precision was calculated by the formula 4.\nP\u0302 r = TP\nTP + FP (4)\nwhere TP is the number of relations scored as correct and FP is the number of relations scored as erroneous.\nTables II, III and IV show results of these experiments. Column nom contains number of unique ISA relations extracted only from nominative construct, inst is the number of unique relations only from instrumental constructs, nom\u2229inst refers to count of relations extracted from nominatives and instrumentals. Table III refers to the number of relations that were additionally accepted only thanks to pseudosubclass boosting which helped to observe a given relation more than t times or with both grammar cases.\nTotal number of extracted IS-A relations, for either nominative or instrumental construction, is slightly above 4 milion (table II). Increase of support level results in drop of accepted relations (up to 1 order of magnitude between consecutive levels). Final count of relations (for t = 4) does not exceed 90000, which is almost 2 orders of magnitude lower than the total.\nPseudo-subclass boosting method allows to extract around 86000 more relations at support level 2. Nominal number of additional relations decreases for higher support levels, but increases in terms of relative gain (as shown in the last column of table III).\nEstimated precision of our method is 61% at the lowest support level, and achieves 87% for level 4\n(table IV). Increasing the number of accepted relations with pseudo-subclass boosting comes at the cost of lower estimated precision. At support level 2 this loss is 1%, but for 3 and 4 jumps to several percent. Estimated precision of our method, equipped with pseudo-subclass boosting, increases with the increase of t, saturating at the level of about 80%.\nExperiments were performed on a cluster of 70 machines with total of 980 CPU cores and 4.375TB of RAM.

It can be connected to the natural model of language, where distribution of word frequencies has power law probability distribution [27]. There is a lot of particular, domain specific taxonomical information that is infrequent in textual resources accessible on the Internet. On the other hand more common knowledge that can be found multiple times in text is substantially less frequent.\nOf course pseudo-subclasses don\u2019t give any boost when t = 1 and do not affect precision, because we simply accept everything that passes the final filtering rules. In other cases psc increases the number of extractions significantly (the higher t the better), although not as much as to eliminate the effect of increased t. This boosting method is very beneficial for support level 2 as it increases extractions count by 23% with no observable loss in precision (see Table IV). For t = 3 and t = 4 the gain in extractions count comes at the price of significantly lower precision.\nAnalysis of false-positive extractions reveal several types of errors made by this method:\n1) Implicit reference \u2013 which leads to errors like \u2022 autor IS-A dyrektor jednostki (au-\nthor IS-A director of the unit), \u2022 sobota IS-A dzien\u0301 koncertu\ng\u0142\u00f3wnego (Saturday IS-A main concert day).\n2) Wrong decision about phrase begin/ending point8: \u2022 trening funkcjonalny IS-A rodzaj\n(. . . czego?)

It is planned to adapt selected coreference resolution methods to our BigData environment and verify their effectiveness in increasing precision of our extraction method.\nWe plan to achieve better detection of phrase begin/ending points by replacing construction rules described in section II-D with Conditional Random Field classifier trained on sentences scored in our experiment with manually annotated proper phrase boundaries. Creating of such golden standard set of sentences with IS-A relations is of course more time consuming than the approach proposed in this paper. In case of Hearst patterns it turned out to be a necessity. Sentences with Hearst-like enumerations contain more complicated dependency structures which are harder to parse correctly.\nBetter catch-all phrases elimination can be done as a post-processing step. Membership in these classes should be uniformly distributed over instances and subclasses in the taxonomy, so there should be no significant correlation between membership in these classes and proper classes. Filtering methods based on such correlation will be investigated.\nTaking into account the number of filtered out IS-A relations (starting from support level 2) it is worthwhile to consider development of other ways of assessing their correctness. The support level criterion (frequency based) effectively increases quality of extracted information, but at the same time significantly reduces its quantity. It would be interesting to choose one of the most popular classification methods (ea. Support Vector Machine or Random Forest classifier) and check its ability to learn a more sophisticated filtering criterion of incorrect IS-A relations. The feature space for this classification problem could be much richer than simple information about occurrence frequency. One can use more sophisticated characteristics of IS-A relation like for example: size of class and instance phrase (count in number of words), type of sources (nominative, instrumental), popularity of instance and class phrase independently (expressed in number of occurrences among all extracted IS-A relations).\nIt would be also interesting to compare precision of Hearst patterns implemented with pseudo-subclass boosting."}, {"heading": "VII. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This paper presents a novel method of IS-A relation extraction from patterns for Polish that is different from so popular Hearst patterns and is applicable in inflected languages with free word order. Thanks to this method we were able to extract knowledge that may not be expressed in enumeration constructs defined by Hearst. Additionally, a method for boosting relation extractions count is introduced. As mentioned at the beginning, thanks to its simplicity it has potential\napplication in any pattern-based IS-A relation extraction method. As experiments showed, the algorithm achieves satisfactory precision 9 (although there is still room for improvement) and is capable of generating high number of taxonomical relations. This makes it a valuable input source of data for any taxonomy induction task.\nIt is needless to say that experiments described in this paper do not provide a full statistical overview of millions of IS-A relations extracted from the corpus of Polish Internet documents. We focus on an assessment of precision of the proposed IS-A relation extraction method. In-depth statistical analysis of such a dataset is desirable and remains as a task to be accomplished in the next publication devoted to the research path outlined in the previous section."}], "references": [{"title": "Unsupervised ontology induction from text", "author": ["H.
