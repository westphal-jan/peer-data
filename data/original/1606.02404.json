The first problem is that clustering, in the absence of domain knowledge, is usually an under-specified task; the solution of choice may vary significantly between different intended applications. The second one is that performing clustering under many natural models is computationally hard.\nConsider the task of dividing the users of an online shopping service into different groups. The result of this clustering can then be used for example in suggesting similar products to the users in the same group, or for organizing data so that it would be easier to read/analyze the monthly purchase reports. Those different applications may result in conflicting solution requirements. In such cases, one needs to exploit domain knowledge to better define the clustering problem.\nAside from trial and error, a principled way of extracting domain knowledge is to perform clustering using a form of \u2018weak\u2019 supervision. For example, Balcan and\nBlum [BB08] propose to use an interactive framework with \u2019split/merge\u2019 queries for clustering. In another work, Ashtiani and Ben-David [ABD15] require the domain expert to provide the clustering of a \u2019small\u2019 subset of data.\nAt the same time, mitigating the computational problem of clustering is critical. Solving most of the common optimization formulations of clustering is NP-hard (in particular, solving the popular k-means and k-median clustering problems). One approach to address this issues is to exploit the fact that natural data sets usually exhibit some nice properties and likely to avoid the worst-case scenarios. In such cases, optimal solution to clustering may be found efficiently. The quest for notions of niceness that are likely to occur in real data and allow clustering efficiency is still ongoing (see [Ben15] for a critical survey of work in that direction).\nIn this work, we take a new approach to alleviate the computational problem of clustering. In particular, we ask the following question: can weak supervision (in the form of answers to natural queries) help relaxing the computational burden of clustering? This will add up to the other benefit of supervision: making the clustering problem better defined by enabling the accession of domain knowledge through the supervised feedback.\nThe general setting considered in this work is the following. Let X be a set of elements that should be clustered and d a dissimilarity function over it. The oracle (e.g., a domain expert) has some information about a target clustering C\u2217X in mind. The clustering algorithm has access to X, d, and can also make queries about C\u2217X . The queries are in the form of same-cluster queries. Namely, the algorithm can ask whether two elements belong to the same cluster or not. The goal of the algorithm is to find a clustering that meets some predefined clusterability conditions and is consistent with the answers given to its queries.\nWe will also consider the case that the oracle conforms with some optimal k-means solution. We then show that access to a \u2019reasonable\u2019 number of same-cluster queries can enable us to provide an efficient algorithm for otherwise NP-hard problems."}, {"heading": "1.1 Contributions", "text": "The two main contributions of this paper are the introduction of the semi-supervised active clustering (SSAC) framework and, the rather unusual demonstration that access to simple query answers can turn an otherwise NP hard clustering problem into a feasible one.\nBefore we explain those results, let us also mention a notion of clusterability (or \u2018input niceness\u2019) that we introduce. We define a novel notion of niceness of data, called \u03b3-margin property that is related to the previously introduced notion of center proximity [ABS12]. The larger the value of \u03b3, the stronger the assumption becomes, which means that clustering becomes easier. With respect to that \u03b3 parameter, we get a sharp \u2018phase transition\u2019 between k-means being NP hard and being optimally solvable in polynomial time1.\n1The exact value of such a threshold \u03b3 depends on some finer details of the clustering task; whether d is required to be Euclidean and whether the cluster centers must be members of X .\nWe focus on the effect of using queries on the computational complexity of clustering. We provide a probabilistic polynomial time (BPP) algorithm for clustering with queries, that succeeds under the assumption that the input satisfies the \u03b3-margin condition for \u03b3 > 1. This algorithm makes O ( k2 log k + k logn) same-cluster queries to the oracle and runs in O ( kn logn) time, where k is the number of clusters and n is the size of the instance set. On the other hand, we show that without access to query answers, k-means clustering is NP-hard even when the solution satisfies \u03b3-margin property for \u03b3 = \u221a 3.4 \u2248 1.84 and k = \u0398(n\u01eb) (for any \u01eb \u2208 (0, 1)). We further show that access to \u2126(log k + logn) queries is needed to overcome the NP hardness in that case. These results, put together, show an interesting phenomenon. Assume that the oracle conforms to an optimal solution of k-means clustering and that it satisfies the \u03b3-margin property for some 1 < \u03b3 \u2264 \u221a 3.4. In this case, our lower bound means that without making queries k-means clustering is NP-hard, while the positive result shows that with a reasonable number of queries the problem becomes efficiently solvable.\nThis indicates an interesting (and as far as we are aware, novel) trade-off between query complexity and computational complexity in the clustering domain."}, {"heading": "1.2 Related Work", "text": "This work combines two themes in clustering research; clustering with partial supervision (in particular, supervision in the form of answers to queries) and the computational complexity of clustering tasks.\nSupervision in clustering (sometimes also referred to as \u2018semi-supervised clustering\u2019) has been addressed before, mostly in application-oriented works [BBM02, BBM04, KBDM09]. The most common method to convey such supervision is through a set of pairwise link/do-not-link constraints on the instances. Note that in contrast to the supervision we address here, in the setting of the papers cited above, the supervision is non-interactive. On the theory side, Balcan et. al [BB08] propose a framework for interactive clustering with the help of a user (i.e., an oracle). The queries considered in that framework are different from ours. In particular, the oracle is provided with the current clustering, and tells the algorithm to either split a cluster or merge two clusters. Note that in that setting, the oracle should be able to evaluate the whole given clustering for each query.\nAnother example of the use of supervision in clustering was provided by Ashtiani and Ben-David [ABD15]. They assumed that the target clustering can be approximated by first mapping the data points into a new space and then performing k-means clustering. The supervision is in the form of a clustering of a small subset of data (the subset provided by the learning algorithm) and is used to search for such a mapping.\nOur proposed setup combines the user-friendliness of link/don\u2019t-link queries (as opposed to asking the domain expert to answer queries about whole data set clustering, or to cluster sets of data) with the advantages of interactiveness.\nThe computational complexity of clustering has been extensively studied. Many of these results are negative, showing that clustering is computationally hard. For example, k-means clustering is NP-hard even for k = 2 [Das08], or in a 2-dimensional plane [Vat09, MNV09]. In order to tackle the problem of computational complexity,\nsome notions of niceness of data under which the clustering becomes easy have been considered (see [Ben15] for a survey).\nThe closest proposal to this work is the notion of \u03b1-center proximity introduced by Awasthi et. al [ABS12]. We discuss the relationship of that notion to our notion of margin in Appendix B. In the restricted scenario (i.e., when the centers of clusters are selected from the data set), their algorithm efficiently recovers the target clustering (outputs a tree such that the target is a pruning of the tree) for \u03b1 > 3. Balcan and Liang [BL12] improve the assumption to \u03b1 > \u221a 2+1. Ben-David and Reyzin [BDR14] show that this problem is NP-Hard for \u03b1 < 2. Variants of these proofs for our \u03b3-margin condition yield the feasibility of k-means clustering when the input satisfies the condition with \u03b3 > 2 and NP hardness when \u03b3 < 2, both in the case of arbitrary (not necessarily Euclidean) metrics2 ."}, {"heading": "2 Problem Formulation", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Center-based clustering", "text": "The framework of clustering with queries can be applied to any type of clustering. However, in this work, we focus on a certain family of common clusterings \u2013 centerbased clustering in Euclidean spaces3.\nLet X be a subset of some Euclidean space, Rd.

Namely, for every x inX and i \u2264 k, x \u2208 Ci \u21d4 i = argminj d(x, \u00b5j).\nFinally, we assume that the centers \u00b5\u2217 corresponding to C\u2217 are the centers of mass of the corresponding clusters. In other words, \u00b5\u2217i = 1 |Ci| \u2211 x\u2208C\u2217 i x.

We discuss the relationship between these two notions in appendix B."}, {"heading": "2.3 The algorithmic setup", "text": "For a clustering C\u2217 = {C\u22171 , . . . C\u2217k}, a C\u2217-oracle is a function OC\u2217 that answers queries according to that clustering. One can think of such an oracle as a user that has some idea about its desired clustering, enough to answer the algorithm\u2019s queries. The clustering algorithm then tries to recover C\u2217 by querying a C\u2217-oracle. The following notion of query is arguably most intuitive.\nDefinition 2 (Same-cluster Query). A same-cluster query asks whether two instances x1 and x2 belong to the same cluster, i.e.,\nOC\u2217(x1, x2) = { true if x1 C\u2217\u223c x2\nfalse o.w.\n(we omit the subscript C\u2217 when it is clear from the context).\nDefinition 3 (Query Complexity).

Such an algorithm is a polynomial q-solver if its time-complexity is polynomial in |X | and |C\u2217| (the number of clusters).\n3. We say G admits an O(q) query complexity if there exists an algorithm A that is a polynomial q-solver for every clustering instance in G."}, {"heading": "3 An Efficient SSAC Algorithm", "text": "In this section we provide an efficient algorithm for clustering with queries. The setting is the one described in the previous section. In particular, it is assumed that the oracle has a center-based clustering in his mind which satisfies the \u03b3-margin property. The space is Euclidean and the center of each cluster is the center of mass of the instances in that cluster. The algorithm not only makes same-cluster queries, but also another type of query defined as below.\nDefinition 4 (Cluster-assignment Query). A cluster-assignment query asks the cluster index that an instance x belongs to. In other words OC\u2217(x) = i if and only if x \u2208 C\u2217i .\nNote however that each cluster-assignment query can be replaced with k samecluster queries (see appendix A in supplementary material). Therefore, we can express everything in terms of the more natural notion of same-cluster queries, and the use of cluster-assignment query is just to make the representation of the algorithm simpler.\nIntuitively, our proposed algorithm does the following. In the first phase, it tries to approximate the center of one of the clusters. It does this by asking cluster-assignment queries about a set of randomly (uniformly) selected point, until it has a sufficient number of points from at least one cluster (say Cp). It uses the mean of these points, \u00b5\u2032p, to approximate the cluster center.\nIn the second phase, the algorithm recovers all of the instances belonging to Cp. In order to do that, it first sorts all of the instances based on their distance to \u00b5\u2032p. By showing that all of the points in Cp lie inside a sphere centered at \u00b5\u2032p (which does not include points from any other cluster), it tries to find the radius of this sphere by doing binary search using same-cluster queries. After that, the elements in Cp will be located and can be removed from the data set. The algorithm repeats this process k times to recover all of the clusters.\nThe details of our approach is stated precisely in Algorithm 1. Note that \u03b2 is a small constant4. Theorem 7 shows that if \u03b3 > 1 then our algorithm recovers the target clustering with high probability. Next, we give bounds on the time and query complexity of our algorithm. Theorem 8 shows that our approach needs O(k logn + k2 log k) queries and runs with time complexity O(kn log n).\nLemma 5. Let (X , d, C) be a clustering instance, where C is center-based and satisfies the \u03b3-margin property. Let \u00b5 be the set of centers corresponding to the centers of mass of C. Let \u00b5\u2032i be such that d(\u00b5i, \u00b5 \u2032 i) \u2264 r(Ci)\u01eb, where r(Ci) = maxx\u2208Ci d(x, \u00b5i) . Then \u03b3 \u2265 1 + 2\u01eb implies that\n\u2200x \u2208 Ci, \u2200y \u2208 X \\ Ci \u21d2 d(x, \u00b5\u2032i) < d(y, \u00b5\u2032i)\nProof. Fix any x \u2208 Ci and y \u2208 Cj . d(x, \u00b5\u2032i) \u2264 d(x, \u00b5i) + d(\u00b5i, \u00b5\u2032i) \u2264 r(Ci)(1 + \u01eb). Similarly, d(y, \u00b5\u2032i) \u2265 d(y, \u00b5i)\u2212 d(\u00b5i, \u00b5\u2032i) > (\u03b3\u2212 \u01eb)r(Ci). Combining the two, we get that d(x, \u00b5\u2032i) < 1+\u01eb \u03b3\u2212\u01ebd(y, \u00b5 \u2032 i).\nLemma 6. Let the framework be as in Lemma 5. Let Zp, Cp, \u00b5p, \u00b5\u2032p and \u03b7 be defined as in Algorhtm 1, and \u01eb = \u03b3\u221212 . If |Zp| > \u03b7, then the probability that d(\u00b5p, \u00b5\u2032p) > r(Cp)\u01eb is at most \u03b4k . Proof. Define a uniform distribution U over Cp. Then \u00b5p and \u00b5\u2032p are the true and empirical mean of this distribution. Using a standard concentration inequality (Thm. 26 from Appendix D) shows that the empirical mean is close to the true mean, completing the proof.\nTheorem 7. Let (X , d, C) be a clustering instance, where C is center-based and satisfies the \u03b3-margin property. Let \u00b5i be the center of mass of Ci. Assume \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1) and \u03b3 > 1. Then with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4, Algorithm 1 outputs C.\n4It corresponds to the constant appeared in generalized Hoeffding inequality bound, discussed in Theorem 26 in appendix D in supplementary materials.\nAlgorithm 1: Algorithm for \u03b3(> 1)-margin instances with queries\nInput: Clustering instance X , oracle O, the number of clusters k and parameter \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1) Output: A clustering C of the set X C = {}, S1 = X , \u03b7 = \u03b2 log k+log(1/\u03b4)(\u03b3\u22121)4 for i = 1 to k do\nPhase 1 l = k\u03b7 + 1; Z \u223c U l[Si] // Draws l independent elements from Si uniformly at random For 1 \u2264 t \u2264 i, Zt = {x \u2208 Z : O(x) = t}. //Asks cluster-assignment queries about the members of Z p = argmaxt |Zt| \u00b5\u2032p := 1 |Zp| \u2211 x\u2208Zp x.\nPhase 2 // We know that there exists ri such that \u2200x \u2208 Si, x \u2208 Ci \u21d4 d(x, \u00b5\u2032i) < ri. // Therefore, ri can be found by simple binary search S\u0302i = Sorted({Si}) // Sorts elements of {x : x \u2208 Si} in increasing order of d(x, \u00b5\u2032p). ri = BinarySearch(S\u0302i) //This step takes up to O(log |Si|) same-cluster queries C\u2032p = {x \u2208 Si : d(x, \u00b5\u2032p) \u2264 ri}. Si+1 = Si \\ C\u2032p. C = C \u222a {C\u2032p}\nend\nProof. In the first phase of the algorithm we are making l > k\u03b7 cluster-assignment queries. Therefore, using the pigeonhole principle, we know that there exists cluster index p such that |Zp| > \u03b7. Then Lemma 6 implies that the algorithm chooses a center \u00b5\u2032p such that with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4k we have d(\u00b5p, \u00b5\u2032p) \u2264 r(Cp)\u01eb. By Lemma 5, this would mean that d(x, \u00b5\u2032p) < d(y, \u00b5 \u2032 p) for all x \u2208 Cp and y 6\u2208 Cp. Hence, the radius ri found in the phase two of Alg. 1 is such that ri = max x\u2208Cp d(x, \u00b5\u2032p). This implies that C\u2032p (found in phase two) equals to Cp. Hence, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4k one iteration of the algorithm successfully finds all the points in a cluster Cp. Using union bound, we get that with probability at least 1\u2212 k \u03b4k = 1\u2212 \u03b4, the algorithm recovers the target clustering.\nTheorem 8. Let the framework be as in theorem 7. Then Algorithm 1 \u2022 Makes O ( k logn+ k2 log k+log(1/\u03b4)(\u03b3\u22121)4 ) same-cluster queries to the oracle O.\n\u2022 Runs in O ( kn logn+ k2 log k+log(1/\u03b4)(\u03b3\u22121)4 ) time.\nProof. In each iteration (i) the first phase of the algorithm takes O(\u03b7) time and makes\n\u03b7+1 cluster-assignment queries (ii) the second phase takes O(n log n) times and makes O(log n) same-cluster queries. Each cluster-assignment query can be replaced with k same-cluster queries; therefore, each iteration runs in O(k\u03b7 + n logn) and uses O(k\u03b7 + logn) same-cluster queries. By replacing \u03b7 = \u03b2 log k+log(1/\u03b4)(\u03b3\u22121)4 and noting that there are k iterations, the proof will be complete.\nCorollary 9. The set of Euclidean clustering instances that satisfy the \u03b3-margin property for some \u03b3 > 1 admits query complexity O ( k logn+ k2 log k+log(1/\u03b4)(\u03b3\u22121)4 ) ."}, {"heading": "4 Hardness Results", "text": "4.1 Hardness of Euclidean k-means with Margin\nFinding k-means solution without the help of an oracle is generally computationally hard.

Row Gi is composed of 3m points {gi,1, . . . , gi,3m}. The distances between the points are also shown in Fig. 1. Also, all these points have weight w, simply meaning that each point is actually a set of w points on the same location.\nEach set Zi is constructed based on Si. In particular, Zi = \u222aj\u2208[3m]Bi,j , where Bi,j is a subset of {xi,j , x\u2032i,j , yi,j , y\u2032i,j} and is constructed as follows: xi,j \u2208 Bi,j iff j 6\u2208 Si, and x\u2032i,j \u2208 Bi,j iff j \u2208 Si. Similarly, yi,j \u2208 Bi,j iff j 6\u2208 Si+1, and y\u2032i,j \u2208 Bi,j iff j \u2208 Si+1. Furthermore, xi,j , x\u2032i,j , yi,j and y\u2032i,j are specific locations as depicted in Fig. 2. In other words, exactly one of the locations xi,j and x\u2032i,j , and one of yi,j and y\u2032i,j will be occupied.

The set X = Hl,n \u222aZ has a k-clustering of cost less or equal to L if and only if there is an exact cover for the X3C instance.\nLemma 13. Any k-clustering of X = Hl,n \u222a Z with cost \u2264 L has the \u03b3-margin property where \u03b3 = \u221a 3.4. Furthermore, k = \u0398(n\u01eb).\nThe proofs are provided in Appendix C. Lemmas 12 and 13 together show that X has a k-clustering of cost \u2264 L satisfying the \u03b3-margin property (for \u03b3 = \u221a 3.4) if and only if there is an exact cover by 3-sets for the X3C instance.

In this section, we show a lower bound on the number of queries needed to provide a polynomial-time algorithm for k-means clustering under margin assumption. Theorem 14. For any \u03b3 \u2264 \u221a 3.4, finding the optimal solution to the k-means objective function is NP-Hard even when the optimal clustering satisfies the \u03b3-margin property and the algorithm can ask O(log k + log |X |) same-cluster queries.\nProof.

We also provided a lower bound indicating that at least \u2126(log kn) queries are needed to make those NP hard problems feasibly solvable.\nWith practical applications of clustering in mind, a natural extension of our model is to allow the oracle (i.e., the domain expert) to refrain from answering a certain fraction of the queries, or to make a certain number of errors in its answers. It would be interesting to analyze how the performance guarantees of SSAC algorithms behave as a function of such abstentions and error rates.

If the clustering algorithm has access to an instance from each of k clusters (say xi \u2208 Xi), then it can simply simulate the cluster-assignment query by making k samecluster queries (Q(x) = argmaxi 1{Q(x, xi)}). Otherwise, assume that at the time of querying Q(x) it has only instances from k\u2032 < k clusters.

We further showed upper and lower bounds on the computational complexity of clustering under this assumption. It is therefore important to compare this notion with other previouslystudied clusterability notions.\nAn important notion of niceness of data for clustering is \u03b1-center proximity property.\nDefinition 17 (\u03b1-center proximity [ABS12]). Let (X , d) be a clustering instance in some metric space M , and let k be the number of clusters. We say that a center-based clustering CX = {C1, . . . , Ck} induced by centers c1, . . . , ck \u2208 M satisfies the \u03b1center proximity property (with respect to X and k) if the following holds\n\u2200x \u2208 Ci, i 6= j, \u03b1d(x, ci) < d(x, cj)\nThis property has been considered in the past in various studies [BL12, ABS12]. In this appendix we will show some connections between \u03b3-margin and \u03b1-center proximity properties.\nIt is important to note that throughout this paper we considered clustering in Euclidean spaces. Furthermore, the centers were not restricted to be selected from the data points. However, this is not necessarily the case in other studies.\nAn overview of the known results under \u03b1-center proximity is provided in Table 1. The results are provided for the case that the centers are restricted to be selected from the training set, and also the unrestricted case (where the centers can be arbitrary points\nfrom the metric space). Note that any upper bound that works for general metric spaces also works for the Euclidean space.\nWe will show that using the same techniques one can prove upper and lower bounds for \u03b3-margin property. It is important to note that for \u03b3-margin property, in some cases the upper and lower bounds match. Hence, there is no hope to further improve those bounds unless P=NP. A summary of our results is provided in 2.\nB.1 Centers from data\nTheorem 18. Let (X, d) be a clustering instance and \u03b3 \u2265 2. Then, Algorithm 1 in [BL12] outputs a tree T with the following property:\nAny k-clustering C\u2217 = {C\u22171 , . . . , C\u2217k} which satisfies the \u03b3-margin property and its cluster centers \u00b51, . . . , \u00b5k are in X , is a pruning of the tree T . In other words, for every 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, there exists a node Ni in the tree T such that C\u2217i = Ni.\nProof. Let p, p\u2032 \u2208 C\u2217i and q \u2208 C\u2217j . [BL12] prove the correctness of their algorithm for \u03b1 > \u221a 2 + 1. Their proof relies only on the following three properties which are implied when \u03b1 > \u221a 2 + 1. We will show that these properties are implied by \u03b3 > 2 instances as well. \u2022 d(p, \u00b5i) < d(p, q) \u03b3d(p, \u00b5i) < d(q, \u00b5i) < d(p, q) + d(p, \u00b5i) =\u21d2 d(p, \u00b5i) < 1\u03b3\u22121d(p, q).\n\u2022 d(p, \u00b5i) < d(q, \u00b5i) This is trivially true since \u03b3 > 2. \u2022 d(p, \u00b5i) < d(p\u2032, q) Let r = maxx\u2208C\u2217 i d(x, \u00b5i).

[BBV08] showed that if a clustering C\u2217 has the strong stability property, then single-linkage outputs a tree with the required property.

In this appendix we provide the proofs for these lemmas. In order to start, we first need to establish some properties about the Euclidean embedding of X proposed in Section 4.\nDefinition 22 (A- and B-Clustering of Ri). An A-Clustering of row Ri is a clustering in the form of {{si}, {ri,1, ri,2}, {ri,3, ri,4}, . . . , {ri,6m\u22121, ri,6m}, {ri,6m+1, fi}}. A B-Clustering of row Ri is a clustering in the form of {{si, ri,1}, {ri,2, ri,3}, {ri,4, ri,5}, . . . , {ri,6m, ri,6m+1}, {fi}}.\nDefinition 23 (Good point for a cluster). A cluster C is good for a point z 6\u2208 C if adding z to C increases cost by exactly 2w3 h 2\nGiven the above definition, the following simple observations can be made. \u2022 The clusters {ri,2j\u22121, ri,2j}, {ri,2j , ri,2j+1} and {gi,j} are good for xi,j and yi\u22121,j . \u2022 The clusters {ri,2j , ri,2j+1} and {gi,j} are good for x\u2032i,j and y\u2032i\u22121,j .\nDefinition 24 (Nice Clustering). A k-clusteirng is nice if every gi,j is a singleton cluster, each Ri is grouped in the form of either an A-clustering or a B-clustering, and each point in Zi is added to a cluster which is good for it.\nIt is straightforward to see that a row grouped in a A-clustering costs (6m+3)w\u2212\u03b1 while a row in B-clustering costs (6m + 3)w. Hence, a nice clustering of Hl,m \u222a Z costs at most L1 + L2. More specifically, if t rows are group in a A-clustering, the nice-clustering costs L1 + L2 \u2212 t\u03b1. Also, observe that any nice clustering of X has only the following four different types of clusters. (1) Type E - {ri,2j\u22121, ri,2j+1}\nThe cost of this cluster is 2w and the contribution of each location to the cost (i.e., cost #locations ) is 2w 2 = w. (2) Type F - {ri,2j\u22121, ri,2j , xi,j} or {ri,2j\u22121, ri,2j , yi\u22121,j} or {ri,2j , ri,2j+1, x\u2032i,j} or {ri,2j , ri,2j+1, y\u2032i\u22121,j} The cost of any cluster of this type is 2w(1 + h 2\n3 ) and the contribution of each location to the cost is at most 2w9 (h\n2 + 3). This is equal to 169 w because we had set h = \u221a 5.\n(3) Type I - {gi,j, xi,j} or {gi,j, x\u2032i,j} or {gi,j, yi,j} or {gi,j, y\u2032i,j} The cost of any cluster of this type is 23wh\n2 and the contribution to the cost of each location is w3 h\n2. For our choice of h, the contribution is 53w. (4) Type J - {si, ri,1} or {ri,6m+1, fi}\nThe cost of this cluster is 3w (or 3w \u2212 \u03b1) and the contribution of each location to the cost is at most 1.5w. Hence, observe that in a nice-clustering, any location contributes at most \u2264 169 w to the total clustering cost. This observation will be useful in the proof of the lemma below.\nLemma 25. For large enoughw = poly(l,m), any non-nice clustering of X = Hl,m\u222a Z costs at least L+ w3 .\nProof. We will show that any non-nice clustering C of X costs at least w3 more than any nice clustering. This will prove our result. The following cases are possible. \u2022 C contains a cluster Ci of cardinality t > 6 (i.e., contains t weighted points)\nObserve that any x \u2208 Ci has at least t \u2212 5 locations at a distance greater than 4 to it, and 4 locations at a distance at least 2 to it. Hence, the cost of Ci is at least w 2t (4\n2(t\u2212 5)+224)t = 8w(t\u2212 4). Ci allows us to use at most t\u2212 2 singletons. This is because a nice clustering of these t + (t \u2212 2) points uses at most t \u2212 1 clusters and the clustering C uses 1 + (t \u2212 2) clusters for these points. The cost of the nice cluster on these points is \u2264 16w9 2(t\u2212 1). While the non-nice clustering costs at least 8w(t\u2212 4). For t \u2265 6.4 =\u21d2 8(t\u2212 4) > 329 (t\u2212 1) and the claim follows. Note that in this case the difference in cost is at least 8w3 . \u2022 Contains a cluster of cardinality t = 6 Simple arguments show that amongst all clusters of cardinality 6, the following has the minimum cost. Ci = {ri,2j\u22121, ri,2j , xi,j , yi\u22121,j , ri,2j+1, r2j+2}. The cost of this cluster is 176w6 . Arguing as before, this allows us to use 4 singletons. Hence, a nice cluster on these 10 points costs at most 160w9 . The difference of cost is at least 34w.\n\u2022 Contains a cluster of cardinality t = 5 Simple arguments show that amongst all clusters of cardinality 5, the following has the minimum cost. Ci = {ri,2j\u22121, ri,2j , xi,j , yi\u22121,j , ri,2j+1}. The cost of this cluster is 16w. Arguing as before, this allows us to use 3 singletons. Hence, a nice cluster on these 8 points costs at most 16w 89 . The difference of cost is at least 16w 9 . \u2022 Contains a cluster of cardinality t = 4 It is easy to see that amongst all clusters of cardinality 4, the following has the minimum cost. Ci = {ri,2j\u22121, ri,2j , xi,j , ri,2j+1}. The cost of this cluster is 11w. Arguing as before, this allows us to use 2 singletons. Hence, a nice cluster on these 6 points costs at most 32w3 . The difference of cost is at least w 3 . \u2022 All the clusters have cardinality \u2264 3 Observe that amongst all non-nice clusters of cardinality 3, the following has the minimum cost. Ci = {ri,2j\u22121, ri,2j , ri,2j+1}. The cost of this cluster is 8w. Arguing as before, this allows us to use at most 1 more singleton. Hence, a nice cluster on these 4 points costs at most 64w9 . The difference of cost is at least 8w 9 .\nIt is also simple to see that any non-nice clustering of size 2 causes an increase in cost of at least w.\nProof of lemma 12. The proof is identical to the proof of Lemma 11 in [Vat09]. Note that the parameters that we use are different with those utilized by [Vat09]; however, this is not an issue, because we can invoke our lemma 25 instead of the analogous result in Vattani (i.e., lemma 10 in Vattani\u2019s paper). The sketch of the proof is that based on lemma 25, only nice clusterings of X cost \u2264 L. On the other hand, a nice clustering corresponds to an exact 3-set cover. Therefore, if there exists a clustering of X of cost \u2264 L, then there is an exact 3-set cover. The other way is simpler to proof; assume that there exists an exact 3-set cover. Then, the corresponding construction of X makes sure that it will be clustered nicely, and therefore will cost \u2264 L.\nProof of lemma 13. As argued before, any nice clustering has four different types of clusters. We will calculate the minimum ratio ai = d(y,\u00b5) d(x,\u00b5) for each of these clusters Ci (where x \u2208 Ci, y 6\u2208 Ci and \u00b5 is mean of all the points in Ci.) Then, the minimum ai will give the desired \u03b3. (1) For Type E clusters ai = h/1 = \u221a 5.\n(2) For Type F clusters. ai =\n\u221a 4+16(h2\u22121)\n3 2h/3 = \u221a 17 5 \u2248 1.84.\n(3) For Type I clusters, standard calculation show that ai > 2. (4) For Type J clusters ai = 2+ \u221a 6 2\u221a 6\n2\n> 2.\nFurthurmore, |X | = (12lm + 3l \u2212 6m)w and k = 6lm + 2l \u2212 3m.

We study the query and computational complexity of clustering in this framework. We consider a setting where the expert conforms to a center-based clustering with a notion of margin. We show that there is a trade off between computational complexity and query complexity; We prove that for the case of k-means clustering (i.e., when the expert conforms to a solution of k-means), having access to relatively few such queries allows efficient solutions to otherwise NP hard problems. In particular, we provide a probabilistic polynomial-time (BPP) algorithm for clustering in this setting that asks O ( k 2 log k + k log n) same-cluster queries and runs with time complexity O ( kn log n) (where k is the number of clusters and n is the number of instances). The algorithm succeeds with high probability for data satisfying margin conditions under which, without queries, we show that the problem is NP hard. We also prove a lower bound on the number of queries needed to have a computationally efficient clustering algorithm in this setting.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
