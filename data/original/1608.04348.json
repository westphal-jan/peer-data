Since there is no canonical linear ordering for multivariate data, many different notions of ordering have been proposed in the literature [23], and the problem is very much application dependent.\nIn the context of multiobjective optimization, ordering by dominance relations has achieved prominence. A general multiobjective optimization problem involves finding among a set of feasible solutions those that minimize a collection of objectives. One feasible solution is said to dominate another if it gives a smaller value for every objective. The collection of feasible solutions that are not dominated by any other solution are called Pareto-optimal or nondominated. In the database community the Pareto-optimal solutions are called the skyline of the dataset [22].\nThe notion of Pareto-optimality is widely used in evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective optimization [27], such as the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) [10], the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) [29, 30], and the Pareto envelope-based selection algorithm (PESA) [9], among many others (see [15] for a survey). Central to many of these algorithms is the assignment of a fitness to each feasible solution based on sorting all the feasible solutions via dominance.\nThe NSGA-II algorithm assigns its fitness level via nondominated sorting, sometimes called Pareto Depth Analysis (PDA), which arranges the feasible solutions into layers by repeatedly\n\u2217The second author was supported by NSF grant DMS-1500829. \u2020Department of Mathematics and Statistics, McGill University.

(adam.oberman@mcgill.ca)\npeeling off the Pareto-optimal solutions. Nondominated sorting has also found applications in gene selection and ranking [16], anomaly detection [19, 20], and multiquery image retrieval [18]. As it turns out, nondominated sorting is equivalent to the longest chain problem, which has a long history in combinatorics and probability [2].\nDue to the wide use of NSGA-II, there has been significant interest in fast algorithms for nondominated sorting [10, 21, 14]. Recently, Calder et al. [5] established a continuum limit for nondominated sorting that corresponds to solving a Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation (HJE). This result shows that there is a simple asymptotic structure underlying nondominated sorting, and this opens the door to extremely fast algorithms based on exploiting this structure. Calder et al. [6] recently proposed a sublinear algorithm for approximate nondominated sorting called PDE-based ranking that is based on estimating the distribution of the data and solving the HJE numerically.\nThe purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we show how to use PDE-based ranking to significantly improve the performance of algorithms that are based on nondominated sorting. To illustrate this in a concrete setting, we propose a new real-time version of the multicriteria PDA anomaly detection algorithm from [20] that uses PDE-based ranking in place of nondominated sorting. The computational complexity is reduced by an order of magnitude (from quadratic to linear), and this allows the model to be updated in real-time upon the acquisition of each additional data sample. We also prove in Theorem 2 a convergence rate for the PDE-based ranking continuum approximation.\nSecond, we present a new partial differential equation (PDE) continuum limit for ordering solutions within the layers generated by nondominated sorting in two dimensions. This new continuum limit allows us to efficiently explore the tradeoff between multiple objectives. In the context of multi-criteria anomaly detection, we show how to use this PDE continuum limit to classify anomalies based on which criterion is more significantly violated. We give a derivation of these new continuum limits and present a convergence analysis. In both cases, we trade exact algorithms of high computational complexity for fast approximate algorithms that are convergent, meaning that the error in the approximation goes to zero as the sample size grows.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the continuum limit for nondominated sorting from [5], and present the PDA multicriteria anomaly detection algorithm from [20]. In Section 3, we derive two new PDE continuum limits for ordering points within Pareto fronts, and fast upwind schemes for solving these PDEs numerically. In Section 4, we present our fast PDE-based anomaly detection and classification algorithm in the context of streaming data, and in Section 5 we present the results of numerical experiments for both real and synthetic data streams."}, {"heading": "2 Previous work", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Nondominated sorting", "text": "Nondominated sorting arranges a set of points in Rd into layers by repeatedly peeling off the coordinatewise minimal points. The coordinatewise partial order on Rd is defined by\nx \u2266 y \u21d0\u21d2 \u2200i xi \u2264 yi (x, y \u2208 Rd).\nLet Sn = {X1, . . . ,Xn} \u2282 Rd be a collection of n points in Rd. We say a point Xi \u2208 Sn is minimal (or nondominated), if no other non-identical point in Sn is smaller with respect to the coordinatewise partial order \u2266. The first nondominated layer, denoted F1, consists of the minimal points from Sn. The second nondominated layer, denoted F2, consists of the minimal points from Sn \\ F1 and the kth layer is defined recursively by\nFk = Minimal points from Sn \\ (F1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a Fk\u22121).\nNondominated sorting refers to the process of arranging the set Sn into the nondominated layers F1,F2,F3, . . . , which are also called Pareto fronts. See Figure 1 for a demonstration of nondominated sorting applied to random points. The index of the Pareto front that a point Xi \u2208 Sn lies on is often called the Pareto depth or Pareto rank of Xi, and provides the fitness score for the NSGA-II algorithm. In the context of multiobjective optimization, d represents the number of objectives.\nThe original nondominated sorting algorithm proposed in [10] requires O(dn2) memory and operations. The quadratic memory complexity in n renders the algorithm intractable for even moderate n. Jensen [21] proposed an algorithm with asymptotic complexity of O(n(log n)d\u22121) as n \u2192 \u221e. The two dimensional version of Jensen\u2019s algorithm was discovered independently in the combinatorics community by Felsner and Wernisch [13]. Fortin et al. [14] recently made some improvements to Jensen\u2019s algorithm regarding its treatment of points with identical coordinates. The exponential complexity of the Jensen-Fortin algorithm with respect to d suggests it may not be useful for high dimensional problems. However, recent numerical results have suggested a better asymptotic complexity as d \u2192 \u221e with n fixed [20]. See [26, 7, 12] for other notable approaches to nondominated sorting.\nCalder et al. [5] discovered a Hamilton-Jacobi equation continuum limit for nondominated sorting. The result applies in the setting where Sn = {X1, . . . ,Xn} is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with probability density f on the unit box (0, 1)d. Define the Pareto depth function Un : Sn \u2192 N associated with nondominated sorting of Sn by Un(Xi) = k if and only if Xi \u2208 Fk. The following continuum limit was established in [5].\nTheorem 1 (HJE Continuum Limit). With probability one\nn\u2212 1 dUn \u2212\u2192 Cdu uniformly on [0, 1]d as n \u2192 \u221e\nwhere Cd > 0 is a constant depending only on d, and u : [0, 1] d \u2192 R is the unique nondecreasing viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation\nux1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 uxd = f in (0, 1]d\nu = 0 on \u2202(0, 1)d \\ (0, 1]d.\n} (1)\nHere uxi := \u2202u \u2202xi denotes the partial derivative of u with respect to xi, and by nondecreasing we mean that uxi \u2265 0 for all i. Figure 1 gives an illustration of this continuum limit when X1, . . . ,Xn are independent and uniformly distributed. The continuum limit in Theorem 1 states that the Pareto fronts converge to the level sets of the viscosity solution u of (1). While the value of Cd is not needed for sorting, we should mention that it is known only in dimension d = 2, in which case C2 = 1 [24, 28].\nCalder et al. [6] proposed a fast algorithm for approximate nondominated sorting called PDE-based ranking that is based on estimating the density function f from a small subset of the data X1, . . . ,Xn and then solving (1) numerically.\nHamilton-Jacobi equations like (1) generally do not admit classical solutions (i.e., continuously differentiable solutions) due to the possibility of crossing characteristics. There are, however, infinitely many functions u that are differentiable almost everywhere and satisfy (1) at each point of differentiability. The notion of viscosity solution selects from among these infinitely many feasible solutions the one that is \u2018physically correct\u2019 for a very wide range of problems. In this context, the viscosity solution is correct because it captures the continuum limit of the Pareto depth function [5].\nThe notion of viscosity solution is based on the maximum principle and enjoys very strong stability properties. It is a notion of weak solution that allows merely continuous functions to be solutions of a PDE. While viscosity solutions may not possess the derivatives appearing in the equation in the classical sense, the reader will not lose much in the way of understanding by assuming that u is continuously differentiable. It is possible to prove that the viscosity solution u of (1) is H\u00f6lder continuous with exponent 1/d [5]. For more details on viscosity solutions we refer the reader to [1]."}, {"heading": "2.2 Anomaly detection", "text": "To illustrate the computational advantages of PDE-based ranking, we consider a concrete application of nondominated sorting to anomaly detection [20]. Anomaly detection refers to the problem of detecting patterns in data that deviate from the expected behavior. It is an important and challenging problem with a wide array of applications, including computer intrusion detection, video surveillance, credit card fraud, and biometrics [17, 8]. Many anomaly detection algorithms rely on the availability of a measure of distance (or similarity) between data samples, and look for anomalies by finding samples that are far from their nearest neighbors (see [20] and references therein). These algorithms are usually called similarity-based, and are widely used due to their simplicity and robustness.\nIn contrast, feature-based algorithms seek to embed the data into a relatively low dimensional Euclidean space and make use of the ambient Euclidean (or other) distance to detect anomalies. Techniques used for feature-based algorithms include support vector machines (SVM), clustering, neural networks, and statistical approaches based on density estimation [8]. In this paper we consider similarity-based approaches.\nIn many applications, multiple measures of similarity may be required to detect certain types of anomalies. For example, when tracking pedestrians in video surveillance, one criterion may correspond to differences in individual walking speeds, while another might correspond to differences in the shapes of trajectories. Using multiple criteria allows one to detect a wider range of anomalies than could be obtained from a single criterion alone.\nHsiao et al. [20] proposed an algorithm for multi-criteria anomaly detection that integrates the information from multiple similarity measures via nondominated sorting (or Pareto Depth Analysis (PDA)). Suppose we have a training set consisting of N objects Y1, . . . , YN and d measures of similarity c1, . . . , cd for comparing these objects. Without loss of generality, we assume 0 \u2264 ci(\u00b7, \u00b7) \u2264 1\u2014a lower score indicates the objects are more similar with respect to the ith criteria. The training phase of the algorithm consists of computing the n := ( N 2 ) dyads\nXi,j = (c1(Yi, Yj), . . . , cd(Yi, Yj)) \u2208 [0, 1]d, (2) and constructing the Pareto depth function Un by applying nondominated sorting to the n points {Xi,j}Ni,j=1. Recall that Un(Xi,j) = k if and only if Xi,j belongs to the kth Pareto front.\nThe testing phase of the algorithm receives a new object Y and compares it to all training samples to create N new dyads Z1, . . . , ZN given by\nZj = (c1(Y, Yj), . . . , cd(Y, Yj)).\nFix a number k, and let I \u2282 {1, . . . , N} denote the indices of training samples that are among the k nearest neighbors of Y with respect to at least one similarity measure ci. The anomaly score for Y is\n\u03bd = 1 |I| \u2211\nj\u2208I\nUn(Zi), (3)\nand Y is declared an anomaly when \u03bd is larger than a predefined threshold \u03c1 > 0. We note that it is possible to allow different values of k for each criterion. The idea is that typical samples should be close to many of their nearest neighbors in one or many similarities, and thus the dyads Z1, . . . , ZN will lie on earlier Pareto fronts. An anomalous sample should be far from its nearest neighbors in many or all of the similarities, and the dyads will consequently fall on deeper fronts. The PDA anomaly detection algorithm has been validated on real and synthetic data in [19, 20] and has been shown to achieve state of the art results for integrating information from multiple similarities."}, {"heading": "3 New PDE continuum limits", "text": "The Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) continuum limit (1) gives information about which Pareto front a sample lies on. It is also important in applications to know where a sample lies within its Pareto front, as this gives information about the trade-off between the multiple objectives. We present here some new PDE continuum limits for ordering of points within Pareto fronts in dimension two, and we present fast sweeping numerical schemes for solving the PDE.\nSuppose d = 2 and let Sn = {X1, . . . ,Xn} be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with continuous density f on (0, 1)2. Apply nondominated sorting to Sn and then order the points within each Pareto front by x1-coordinate. This defines a function Vn : Sn \u2192 N given by\nVn(Xi) := Index of Xi within its Pareto front. (4)\nFigure 2(a) gives an illustration of Vn. We give an argument in Section A of the appendix suggesting that\nn\u2212 1 2Vn \u2212\u2192 v as n \u2192 \u221e\nuniformly with probability one, where v : [0, 1]2 \u2192 R solves the linear transport equation\n\u2207v \u00b7 \u2207\u22a5u = f in (0, 1)2\nv = 0 on {x2 = 1},\n} (5)\nwhere \u2207\u22a5u := (ux2 ,\u2212ux1) and u is the viscosity solution of (1). Figure 2(b) illustrates this continuum limit.

At each grid point, (6) is linear equation that is readily solved for vh(x) in terms of vh(x\u2212 he1) and vh(x+ he2). The numerical solution vh is computed by sweeping the grid (0, 1)2h exactly once in the upwind direction (1,\u22121).\nSince each Pareto front has in general a different number of points, the values of Vn within different fronts are difficult to compare. Therefore it is natural to consider the following normalization:\nWn(Xi) := Vn(Xi)\n#F(Xi) , (7)\nwhere F(Xi) denotes the Pareto front that Xi belongs to. The quantity Wn(Xi) is an index between 0 and 1 that gives information about where the point Xi falls within its Pareto front.

Each PDE involves the solution of the previous PDEs, so they must be solved in the order (1)-(5)-(8). We solve (1) numerically using the first order accurate scheme presented in [4], which also has linear complexity. The transport PDEs (5) and (8) are degenerate when \u2207u = 0, which can only happen when f vanishes. To avoid this degeneracy, we numerically precondition the density by replacing f with f + h2."}, {"heading": "4 Real-time anomaly detection", "text": "We propose here a modification of the PDA multicriteria anomaly detection algorithm [20] to the setting of online streaming data. Suppose we have a stream of possibly nonstationary data {Yt}t\u2208N, and d measures of similarity c1, . . . , cd for comparing data samples. As before we suppose that 0 \u2264 ci(\u00b7, \u00b7) \u2264 1. In the streaming setting, we observe the data Yt sequentially and must determine whether Yt is an anomaly based only on the previous history {Ys : s < t}. Due to memory and computational constraints, it may not be feasible to use this entire history, especially when t is large. Therefore, we fix T \u2265 1 and consider the windowed history\nHt = {Ys : t\u2212 T \u2264 s \u2264 t\u2212 1}. (10)\nWe use the history Ht as training data in order to determine whether Yt is an anomaly. Even without memory constraints, only the recent history Ht can be considered reliable when the data is nonstationary. As before, we define dyads\nXr,s = (c1(Yr, Ys), . . . , cd(Yr, Ys)) \u2208 [0, 1]d\ncorresponding to every pair (Yr, Ys) of the data stream. If we use the PDA anomaly detection algorithm with exact nondominated sorting, then we would need to store in memory all of the n := ( T 2 ) = O(T 2) dyads corresponding to pairs from the history Ht. Since the addition of a single new sample can potentially affect the arrangement of all the Pareto fronts, retraining the model when new samples are acquired requires applying nondominated sorting to all O(T 2) dyads, which has complexity slightly worse than O(T 2) for memory and operations. This makes it impossible to update the model frequently in the streaming setting without considering some type of approximation to the sorting.\nUsing PDE-based ranking we can reduce this complexity to O(T ). We keep a running estimate of the marginal distribution of the dyads using the following kernel density estimator\nft(x) = 1\nnhd\n\u2211\nt\u2212T\u2264r<s\u2264t\u22121\nK\n( x\u2212Xr,s\nh\n) . (11)\nAlthough there are O(T 2) terms in the sum above, the density estimation ft(x) can be updated recursively in O(T ) time by writing ft(x) = ft\u22121(x) + gt(x) where\ngt(x) = 1\nnhd\nt\u22121\u2211\ns=t\u2212T\nK ( x\u2212Xs,t\nh\n) \u2212K ( x\u2212X(t\u2212T\u22121),s\nh\n) .\nIn our experiments, we use a simple histogram estimator, which is a special case of (11). We then compute an approximation Ut of the Pareto depth function by solving the HJE (1) numerically using the estimated density ft. By Theorem 1 the continuum approximation of the anomaly score is\n\u03bdt = 1 |It| \u2211\ns\u2208It\nUt(Xs,t), (12)\nwhere It \u2282 {t\u2212T, . . . , t\u22121} denotes the indices of samples from the history Ht that are among the ki nearest neighbors of Yt with respect to ci for at least one i \u2208 {1, . . . , d}. We declare Yt anomalous if \u03bdt is greater than a predefined threshold \u03c1. The steps above work in arbitrary dimension d \u2265 2.\nFor the anomaly classification, we specialize to the case of d = 2. If Yt is declared an anomaly, we then solve the transport equations (5) and (8) using the schemes (6) and (9), respectively, to obtain Wt := wh. We define the anomaly classification score\n\u00b5t = 1 |It| \u2211\ns\u2208It\nWt(Xs,t), (13)\nand we declare Yt a c1-anomaly if \u00b5t > 0.5, and a c2-anomaly if \u00b5t < 0.5. Our algorithm is summarized in pseudocode below.\nAlgorithm 1 PDE-based online anomaly detection\n1: Given: \u03c1 > 0 and T \u2208 N 2: fT \u2190 (11) {Initialize density} 3: for t = T + 1 \u2192 \u221e do 4: ft \u2190 ft\u22121 + gt {Update density estimation} 5: Ut \u2190(1) {Solve HJE continuum limit} 6: \u03bdt \u2190 (12) {Compute anomaly score} 7: if \u03bdt > \u03c1 then 8: Declare Yt to be anomalous 9: Wt \u2190 (9) {Solve transport equations}\n10: \u00b5t \u2190 (13) {Compute anomaly class. score} 11: if \u00b5t > 0.5 then Yt is a c1-anomaly 12: if \u00b5t \u2264 0.5 then Yt is a c2-anomaly 13: end if\n14: end for\nThere are some obvious modifications we could make to improve the performance of the algorithm. First, the continuum limit PDE need not be solved at every iteration, and could instead be solved only periodically, or whenever the density estimation ft has substantially changed. Second, to keep track of a larger history without incurring additional costs, the\nhistory Ht could contain T elements equally (or randomly) spaced among the previous \u03b1T samples, where \u03b1 \u226b 1. The algorithm would remain otherwise unchanged and the complexity of each iteration remains O(T ).\nSince the PDE-based anomaly detection algorithm is based on continuum approximations, it is natural to seek a quantification of the approximation error. If we assume the dyads are i.i.d. we can prove the following convergence rate.\nTheorem 2 (Convergence Rate). Let X1, . . . ,Xn be i.i.d. with a Lipschitz continuous probability density f : [0, 1]2 \u2192 [m,\u221e), where m > 0. For h > 0 let u\u0302h denote the numerical solution of (1) obtained via estimating f with a histogram aligned to the grid of spacing h on [0, 1]2.

Theorem 2 extends easily to higher dimensions d \u2265 3. In this case the same convergence rate (14) holds with probability 1\u2212 exp(\u2212C2nh2d+1 \u2212 d log(h)).\nProof of Theorem 2. Let X1, . . . ,Xn be independent and identically distributed random variables on [0, 1]2 with Lipschitz continuous density f : [0, 1]2 \u2192 [0,\u221e). Recall that f is assumed to be positive on [0, 1]2, i.e., there exists m > 0 such that f \u2265 m. Let h := 1/K > 0 be the grid resolution for solving (1) numerically and for estimating the density f with a histogram estimator, where K \u2208 N. For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 K let\nBij = [(i\u2212 1)h, ih) \u00d7 [(j \u2212 1)h, jh)\ndenote the grid cell corresponding to (i, j), and let Nij denote the number of samples from X1, . . . ,Xn falling in Bij . Then Nij is a Binomial random variable with parameters n and\npij =\n\u222b\nBij\nf(x) dx.\nBy the Chernoff-Hoeffding bound (see, e.g., [11]) we have\nP (|Nij \u2212 ENij| \u2265 t) \u2264 exp (\u22122t2\nn\n) (15)\nfor all t \u2265 0.

The first two experiments were performed using synthetic data from [19, 20]. The streaming experiments consist of 1500 total samples with a window history of T = 500. To underscore the adaptive nature of our algorithm, each of these experiments incurs a significant trend change in the middle of the stream. The third and final experiment was performed with a real pedestrian trajectory data set from a video surveillance problem.\nTo evaluate the performance of the streaming algorithm we use a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and its resulting Area Under the Curve (AUC). We consider how the AUC varies with time as the algorithm takes in points from a stream. When changing the trend in the simulated streams, we also accordingly change the data used to generate the ROC curves, thereby giving us an appropriate method to visualize the learning aspect of the algorithm. In each simulated data stream we evaluate both the anomaly detection and anomaly classification. The results presented below represent the average of 20 trials. All PDEs were solved on a 100 \u00d7 100 grid.\nIn each experiment, we compare our continuum limits against the exact sorting PDA algorithm from [19, 20] and we see little to no difference in anomaly detection performance. The PDE-approximations reduce the complexity by an order of magnitude\u2014from O(T 2) to O(T ). To give an idea of the difference in CPU time, each trial in the experiments below takes 27 seconds to process with the PDE-approximations, compared to 413 seconds with exact sorting.

Each sample consists of 2 groups of categorical data A1 and A2. Each group is comprised of 20 different attributes, where each attribute can assume a different number of values. The number of possible values for the jth attribute of the ith group, denoted ni,j, is chosen uniformly at random between 6 and 10. Each attribute is then assigned a categorical distribution with parameters p1, . . . , pni,j which are in turn drawn from a Dirichlet distribution with parameters \u03b11, . . . , \u03b1ni,j .\nThe nominal distribution is characterized by setting \u03b11 = 5 and \u03b1k = 1 for every k 6= 1 for every attribute. For the anomalous distribution we set \u03b1k = 1 for every k. Halfway through the stream the nominal distributions were changed so that for every attribute, the parameters of the categorical distribution were drawn from a Dirichlet distribution with parameters \u03b12 = 5 and \u03b1k = 1 for every k 6= 2. To generate a nominal sample, we draw from the nominal distribution for each group. To generate an anomalous sample, we randomly choose a group with probability 0.5 and draw from the anomalous distribution for that group, and nominal distribution for the other. At each time step in the stream there was a 0.05 probability of drawing an anomalous sample.\nThe similarity between samples was computed between respective groups using the Inverse Occurrence Frequency (IOF) measure presented in [3]. The Goodall2 and Overlap metrics gave similar performance. The nearest neighbour parameters were chosen as k1 = k2 = 10. Figure 3(b) shows the resulting AUCs at each time step.

The first similarity criterion used to compare trajectories was their difference in shape, given by the \u21132-distance between interpolated trajectories. The second was their difference in walking speed, given by the \u21132-distance between the velocity histograms of each trajectory.\nAs a preliminary experiment, we tested the anomaly detection and anomaly classification on 1666 trajectories from a single day. These trajectories were hand-labelled as normal or anomalous by [20]. In each experiment the training set consisted of 500 trajectories randomly drawn from a total of 1666 trajectories that day. The mean AUCs of the PDE-based and exact sorting based algorithms were 0.9274\u00b1 0.0085 and 0.9363\u00b1 0.0072, respectively and the ROC curves are shown in Figure 4(a). We observe very little difference between the exact sorting and the PDE-approximations. We cannot present quantitative results for anomaly classification in this setting as there is no ground truth labeled data available. Along with some normal trajectories, we also plotted some anomalous trajectories with their respective classification scores in Figure 4(b,c).\nFinally, we applied the PDE-based streaming anomaly detection algorithm to a large portion of the pedestrian dataset, spanning over several days of data. Figure 3(c) shows the AUC as a function of artificial time for a simulated stream consisting of 15,000 trajectories with an initial training set of 400 randomly drawn trajectories.

The classification is performed using new PDE continuum limits for ordering within the nondominated layers.

Although we focused in this paper on the anomaly detection problem, the ideas are not restricted to this context. Indeed, nondominated sorting is widely used in multiobjective optimization, and the ideas in this paper potentially apply to any such application, leaving many interesting problems for future work."}, {"heading": "A Derivation of new continuum limits", "text": "We give here derivations of the new PDE continuum limits presented in Section 3. For ease of reference, we recall some of the definitions from the main paper here.\nSuppose d = 2 and let Sn = {X1, . . . ,Xn} be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with continuous density f on (0, 1)2. Apply nondominated sorting to Sn and then order the points\nwithin each Pareto front by x1-coordinate. This defines a function Vn : Sn \u2192 N given by\nVn(Xi) := Index of Xi within its Pareto front. (20)\nBy the continuum limit of nondominated sorting (Theorem 1), there are on the order of n 1 2 Pareto fronts. Since there are n points in total, is is reasonable to conjecture that each front has on the order of n 1 2 points. Therefore, we need to normalize Vn by n 1 2 , and suppose that\nn\u2212 1 2Vn \u2212\u2192 v as n \u2192 \u221e\nuniformly with probability one, where v : [0, 1]2 \u2192 R is continuously differentiable. Fix a large value of n and consider a point x \u2208 (0, 1)2. Fix \u03b5 > 0 and let\ny = x+ \u03b5\u2207\u22a5u(x),\nwhere \u2207\u22a5u = (ux2 ,\u2212ux1). Since \u2207\u22a5u is tangent to the level set {u = u(x)}, we have u(y) \u2248 u(x), i.e., x and y are roughly on the same Pareto front. See Figure 5 for an illustration. Let A denote the rectangle whose diagonal is the line segment from x to y, and let Ln denote the number of points on the Pareto front passing through x and y that fall within A. Then we have\n\u03b5\u2207v(x) \u00b7 \u2207\u22a5u(x) \u2248 v(y)\u2212 v(x) \u2248 n\u2212 12 (Vn(y)\u2212 Vn(x)) = n\u2212 1 2Ln. (21)\nHere, \u2207v = (vx1 , vx2) denotes the gradient of v. When \u03b5 > 0 is small, the random variables within A are approximately uniformly distributed within A. Furthermore, as illustrated in Figure 5, we can scale A to the unit box [0, 1]2 without changing the partial ordering within A. Hence, it is reasonable to conjecture that Ln \u223c c \u221a m, where c > 0 is a universal constant and m is the number of samples falling in A. While the value of c is not needed for sorting (since we perform a normalization in (23) below), a simple scaling argument that we omit suggests that c = 1, so we will take Ln \u223c \u221a m. By the law of large numbers\nm \u223c n \u222b\nA\nf dx \u2248 n|A|f(x) = n\u03b52ux1ux2f(x),\nsince the side lengths of A are |x1 \u2212 y1| = \u03b5ux2 and |x2 \u2212 y2| = ux1 . Combining this with ux1ux2 = f , (21) and Ln \u223c \u221a m yields\n\u03b5\u2207v(x) \u00b7 \u2207\u22a5u(x) \u2248 f(x)\u03b5. Hence this simple heuristic argument suggests that v satisfies the linear transport PDE\n\u2207v \u00b7 \u2207\u22a5u = f in (0, 1)2\nv = 0 on {x2 = 1}.\n} (22)\nSince each Pareto front has in general a different number of points, the values of Vn within different fronts are difficult to compare. Therefore it is natural to consider the following normalization:\nWn(Xi) := Vn(Xi)\n#F(Xi) , (23)\nwhere F(Xi) denotes the Pareto front that Xi belongs to. The quantity Wn(Xi) is an index between 0 and 1 that gives information about where the point Xi falls within its Pareto front.\nThe heuristics above suggest that Wn \u2192 w uniformly with probability one, where\nw(x) = v(x)\nv(1, \u03c8(u(x)) , (24)\nand \u03c8 is the inverse of x2 7\u2192 u(1, x2). In other words, we are normalizing v(x) by the asymptotic number of points on the front to which x belongs.\nThe expression in (24) is difficult to work with numerically. We will instead derive a PDE for w. Differentiating (24) yields\nv\u2207w = w\u2207v \u2212 w2vx2\u03c8\u2032(u)\u2207u. Take the dot product of both sides with \u2207\u22a5u and recall (22) to find that\nv\u2207w \u00b7 \u2207\u22a5u = w\u2207v \u00b7 \u2207\u22a5u = wf. Since w = 1 on {x1 = 1}, w can be characterized as the solution of the following transport PDE\nv\u2207w \u00b7 \u2207\u22a5u = wf in (0, 1)2\nw = 1 on {x1 = 1}.\n} (25)\nOn a slightly more technical note, since u is not necessarily differentiable the velocity \u2207\u22a5u in the transport equations (5) and (25) is not well-defined. To make sense of these PDE rigorously, we can instead write them in divergence form, since\n\u2212div(u\u2207\u22a5v) = \u2207v \u00b7 \u2207\u22a5u. It is possible to prove existence and uniqueness of weak solutions of (5) and (25) in the Sobolev space H1. Such results are outside the scope of this paper, and we intend to pursue them in a future work.\nWe also note the case of dimension d \u2265 3 is considerably more complicated, since there is no canonical linear ordering of the points within each front. If we instead consider ordering the points within fronts via nondominated sorting with respect to different partial orders, it is possible to derive similar continuum limits. However the PDE are highly nonlinear and the analysis is significantly more difficult. We leave these considerations to future work.\nA.1 Convergence analysis\nThe derivations of the transport equations (5) and (8) are heuristic in nature. Establishing these continuum limits rigorously is an important and challenging PDE problem that we plan to pursue in the future. In the meantime, we present here a convergence analysis for the continuum limits (5) and (8) in the case that f \u2261 1, i.e., the samples are independent and uniformly distributed on the unit box [0, 1]2. In this case we can solve all three PDEs (1), (5), and (8) in closed form. We have\nu(x) = 2 \u221a x1x2, v(x) = \u2212 \u221a x1x2 log(x2), and w(x) =\nlog(x2)\nlog(x1) + log(x2) .\nWe performed a convergence analysis by drawing X1, . . . ,Xn independent and uniformly distributed on [0, 1]2 and computing Vn and Wn according to their definitions (20) and (23), respectively. We measured the discrepancy with the continuum limits in the \u21131 and \u2113\u221e norms, computed by\n\u2016v \u2212 n\u2212 12Vn\u2016\u21131 := 1\nn\nn\u2211\ni=1\n|v(Xi)\u2212 n\u2212 1 2Vn(Xi)|.\nand \u2016v \u2212 n\u2212 12Vn\u2016\u2113\u221e := max\n1\u2264i\u2264n |v(Xi)\u2212 n\u2212\n1 2Vn(Xi)|,\nrespectively. The definitions of \u2016w \u2212Wn\u2016\u2113\u221e and \u2016w \u2212Wn\u2016\u21131 are similar. Figure 6 shows the errors for a single realization and various values of n ranging from n = 102 to n = 108.\nEach of the errors is observed to be converging to zero at a rate of O(n\u2212\u03b1) where \u03b1 \u2248 0.25, except for \u2016w\u2212Wn\u2016\u2113\u221e . Upon closer inspection, the function w(x) = log(x2)/(log(x1)+log(x2)) is discontinuous at x = (1, 1), hence uniform convergence is impossible. This discontinuity reflects the fact that near x = (1, 1) the Pareto fronts cut off an infinitesimal portion of the top corner of the box, and hence Wn transitions from 0 to 1 over an infinitesimally short distance."}], "references": [{"title": "Optimal control and viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi- Bellman equations", "author": ["M.
