Machine learning, exploiting the universality of computation (Turing, 1950), is able to capture the knowledge and computation discovered and transmitted by humans and human culture. However, while leading to spectacular advances, this strategy undermines the assumption of machine neutrality. The default assumption for many was that computation, deriving from mathematics, would be pure and neutral, providing for AI a fairness beyond what is present in human society. Instead, concerns about machine prejudice are now coming to the fore\u2014concerns that our historic biases and prejudices are being reified in machines. Documented cases of automated prejudice range from online advertising (Sweeney, 2013) to criminal sentencing (Angwin et al., 2016).\nMost experts and commentators recommend that AI should always be applied transparently, and certainly without prejudice. Both the code of the algorithm and the process for applying it must be open to the public. Transparency should allow courts, companies, citizen watchdogs, and others to understand, monitor, and suggest improvements to algorithms (Oswald and Grace, 2016). Another recommendation has been diversity among AI developers, to address insensitive or under-informed training of machine learning algorithms (Sweeney, 2013; Noble, 2013; Barr, 2015; Crawford, 2016). A third has been collaboration between engineers and domain experts who are knowledgeable about historical inequalities (Sweeney, 2013).\nHere we show that while all of these strategies might be helpful and even necessary, they could not be sufficient. We document machine prejudice that derives so fundamentally from human culture that it is not possible to eliminate it through strategies such as the above. We demonstrate here for the first time what some have long suspected (Quine, 1960)\u2014that semantics, the meaning of words, necessarily reflects regularities latent in our culture, some of which we now know to be prejudiced. We demonstrate this by showing that standard, widely used Natural Language Processing tools share the same biases humans demonstrate in psychological studies. These tools have their language model built through neutral automated parsing of large corpora derived from the ordinary Web; that is, they are exposed to language much like any human would be. Bias should be the expected result whenever even an unbiased algorithm is used to derive regularities from any data; bias is the regularities discovered.\nar X\niv :1\n60 8.\n07 18\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 5\nA ug\n2 01\n6\nHuman learning is also a form of computation. Therefore our finding that data derived from human culture will deliver biases and prejudice have implications for the human sciences as well. They present a new \u201cnull hypothesis\u201d for explaining the transmission of prejudice between humans. Our findings also have implications for addressing prejudice, whether in humans or machines. The fact that it is rooted in language makes prejudice difficult to address, but by no means impossible. We argue that prejudice must be addressed as a component of any intelligent system learning from our culture. It cannot be entirely eliminated from the system, but rather must be compensated for.\nIn this article, we begin by explaining meaning and the methods by which we determine human understanding, and interpret it in machines. Then we present our results. We replicate previously-documented biases and prejudices in attitudes towards ordinary objects, animals, and humans. We show that prejudices that reduce the number of interview invitations sent to people because of the racial association of their name, and that associate women with arts rather than science or mathematics, can be retrieved from standard language tools used in ordinary AI products. We also show that veridical information about the proportions of women in particular job categories, or what proportion of men versus women have a particular name, can be recovered using the same methods. We then present a detailed account of our methods, and further discussion of the implications of our work."}, {"heading": "Meaning and Bias in Humans and Machines", "text": "In AI and machine learning, bias refers to prior information, a necessary prerequisite for intelligence (Bishop, 2006). Yet bias can be problematic where prior information is derived from precedents known to be harmful. For the purpose of this paper, we will call harmful biases \u2018prejudice\u2019. We show here that prejudice is a special case of bias identifiable only by its negative consequences, and therefore impossible to eliminate purely algorithmically. Rather, prejudice requires deliberate action based on knowledge of a society and its outstanding ethical challenges.\nIf we are to demonstrate that AI incorporates the same bias as humans, we first have to be able to document human bias. We will use several methods to do this below, but the one we use most is the Implicit Association Test (IAT). First introduced by Greenwald et al. (1998), the IAT demonstrates enormous differences in response times when subjects are asked to pair two concepts they find similar, in contrast to two concepts they find different. The IAT follows a reaction time paradigm, which means subjects are encouraged to work as quickly as possible, and their response times are the quantified measure. For example, subjects are much quicker if they are told to label insects as unpleasant and flowers as pleasant than if they are asked to label these objects in reverse. The fact that a pairing is faster is taken to indicate that the task is more easy, and therefore that the two subjects are linked in their mind. The IAT is ordinarily used to pair categories such as \u2018male\u2019 and \u2018female\u2019 with attributes such as \u2018violent\u2019 or \u2018peaceful\u2019. The IAT has been used to describe and account for a wide range of implicit prejudices and other phenomena, including stereotype threat (Kiefer and Sekaquaptewa, 2007; Stanley et al., 2011).\nOur method for demonstrating both bias and prejudice in text is a variant of the implicit association test applied to a widely-used semantic representation of words in AI, termed word embeddings. These are derived by representing the textual context in which a word is found as a vector in a high-dimensional space. Roughly, for each word, its relationship to all other words around it is summed across its many occurrences in a text. We can then measure the distances (more precisely, cosine similarity scores) between these vectors. The thesis behind word embeddings is that words that are closer together in the vector space are semantically closer in some sense. Thus, for example, if we find that \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192programmer is closer to \u2212\u2212\u2192man than to \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192woman, it suggests (but is far from conclusive of) a gender stereotype. We assume here that this measure is analogous to reaction time in the IAT, since the shorter time implies a semantic \u2018nearness\u2019 (McDonald and Lowe, 1998; Moss et al., 1995).\nAs with the IAT, we do not just compare two words. Many if not most words have multiple meanings, which makes pairwise measurements \u201cnoisy\u201d. To control for this, we use small baskets of terms to represent a concept. In the present paper we have never invented our own basket of words, but rather have in every case used the same words as were used in the psychological study we are replicating. We should note that distances / similarities of word embeddings notoriously lack any intuitive interpretation. But this poses no problem for us: our results and their import do not depend on attaching meaning to these distances. Our primary claim is that the associations revealed by relative nearness scores between categories match human biases and stereotypes strongly (i.e., low p-values and high effect sizes) and across many categories. Thus, the associations in the word vectors could not have arisen by chance, but instead reflect extant biases in human culture.\nThere are however several key differences between our method and the IAT. Most of these we will discuss in future versions of this papers\u2019 appendices, but one in particular is critical to our presentation of results. While the IAT applies to individual human subjects, the embeddings of interest to us are derived from the aggregate writings of humans on the web. These corpora are generated in an uncontrolled fashion and are not representative of any one population (though our results indicate they may be disproportionately American; see below). The IAT has sometimes been used to draw conclusions about populations by averaging individual results over samples, and these have led to important insights on racial bias and gender stereotypes, among others. Our tests of word embeddings are loosely analogous to population-level IATs.\n2/14\nNevertheless, this difference precludes a direct numerical comparison between human biases measured by the IAT and algorithmic biases measured by our methods. In particular, an IAT allows rejecting the null hypothesis (of non-association between two categories) via a p-value and quantification of the strength of association via an effect size. These are obtained by administering the test to a statistically-significant sample of subjects (and multiple times to each subject). With word embeddings, there is no notion of test subjects. Roughly, it is as if we are able to measure the mean of the association strength over all the \u201csubjects\u201d who collectively created the corpora. But we have no way to observe variation between subjects or between trials. We do report p-values and effect sizes resulting from the use of multiple words in each category, but the meaning of these numbers is entirely different from those reported in IATs."}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Using the techniques described in the Methods section, we have found every linguistic bias documented in psychology that we have looked for. Below are a sample that we think are persuasive. We have not cherry picked these for effect size\u2014these are uniformly high. Rather, we chose these to illustrate our assertion that we can account for a variety of implicit human biases purely from language regularities, and that these are in fact part and parcel with the meaning of language. We demonstrate this by showing that the same measures that replicate implicit bias also replicate prejudicial hiring practices, and further return veridical information about employment and naming practices in contemporary America.\nWe ensure impartiality in our approach by using the benchmarks and keywords established in well-known and heavily cited works of the human sciences, psychology and sociology. We use a state-of-the-art and widely used word embedding, namely GloVe, made available by Pennington et al. (2014). We used one of GloVe\u2019s standard semantic models trained on standard corpora of ordinary language use found on the World Wide Web. We have also found similar results for other standard tools and corpora, which we will also discuss in future versions of this papers\u2019 appendices.\nFollowing the lead of the IAT, for each result we report the two sets of target concepts about which we are attempting to learn and the two sets of attribute words we are comparing each to. We then apply our method WEAT (defined in the Methods section), and report the probability (p-value) that our observed similarity scores could have arisen with no semantic association between the target concepts and the attribute. We report an effect size based on the number of standard deviations that separate the two sets of target words in terms of their association with the attribute words; precise details of this measure are described in the Methods section."}, {"heading": "Baseline: Replication of Associations That Are Universally Accepted", "text": "The first results presented in the initial publication on the IAT (Greenwald et al., 1998) concerned biases that were found to be universal in humans and about which there is no social concern.

We begin by replicating these inoffensive results for the same purposes."}, {"heading": "Flowers and Insects", "text": "Original Finding: Greenwald et al. (1998, p. 1469) report that the IAT is able to demonstrate via reaction times that flowers are significantly more pleasant than insects, and insects more unpleasant than flowers.

Flowers are more likely than insects to be closer to pleasant than to unpleasant. By applying our method, we observe the expected association with an effect size of 1.50 and with p-value < 10\u22127 for statistical significance.2\nNotice that GloVe \u201cknows\u201d this property of flowers and insects with no direct experience of the world, and no representation of semantics other than the implicit metrics of words\u2019 co-occurrence statistics that it is trained on.\nStimuli: We use the same stimuli as Greenwald et al.

(1998, p. 1475) find extreme impacts of race as indicated simply by name. A bundle of names associated with being European American was found to be significantly easier to associate with pleasant than unpleasant terms, compared to a bundle of African American names. With 26 subjects, Greenwald et al. show that the European American names are more likely to be implicitly associated as pleasant with an effect size of 1.17 and a p-value of 10\u22126.\nOur Finding: We were again able to replicate attitude towards two races by looking at semantic nearness in GloVe. We were forced to slightly alter the stimuli because some of the original African American names did not occur in the corpus with sufficient frequency. These are shown in italics below. We therefore also deleted the same number of European American names, chosen at random, to balance the number of elements in the sets of two concepts.

They found that European American candidates were 50% more likely to be offered an opportunity to be interviewed.\nOur Finding: Perhaps unsurprisingly, we again found a significant result for the names used by Bertrand and Mullainathan. As before, we had to delete some low-frequency names. We also assumed semantic nearness to pleasantness as the correlate for an invitation to interview.

Historically, the consensus was that they should not; today, most but by no means all Americans consider it as appropriate for a woman to have a career as a man. Similarly, there have been historical biases against men who choose to take domestic roles. The IAT study we compare to here was conducted online, and thus has a vastly larger subject pool. However, since there is more difficulty ensuring that online subjects will complete their task with attention, it also has far fewer keywords examined. We are able to replicate the results even with these reduced keyword sets.\nOriginal Finding: With 38,797 interpretable subjects (those who fully completed the test), female names were found to be more associated with family than career words with an effect size of 0.72 and p-value < 10\u22122, Nosek et al.

Loosely, embeddings satisfy the property that vectors that are close to each other represent semantically \u201csimilar\u201d words. Word embeddings derive their power from the discovery that vector spaces with around 300 dimensions suffice to capture most aspects of similarity, enabling a computationally tractable representation of all or most words in large corpora of text (Bengio et al., 2003; Lowe, 1997). Starting in 2013, the word2vec family of word embedding techniques has gained popularity due to a new set of computational techniques for generating word embeddings from large training corpora of text, with superior speed and predictive performance in various natural-language processing tasks (Mikolov et al., 2013; Mikolov and Dean, 2013).\nMost famously, word embeddings excel at solving \u201cword analogy\u201d tasks because the algebraic relationships between vectors capture syntactic and semantic relationships between words (Figure 3). In addition, word embeddings have found use in natural-language processing tasks such as web search and document classification. They have also found use in cognitive science for understanding human memory and recall (Zaromb et al., 2006; McDonald and Lowe, 1998).\nFor all results in this paper we use the state-of-the-art GloVe word embedding method, in which, at a high level, the similarity between a pair of vectors is related to the probability that the words co-occur close to each other in text (Pennington et al., 2014). Word embedding algorithmssuch as GloVe substantially amplify the signal found in simple co-occurrence probabilities using dimensionality reduction. In pilot-work experiments along the lines of those presented here (on free associations rather than implicit associations) raw co-occurrence probabilities were shown to lead to substantially weaker results (Macfarlane, 2013).\nRather than train the embedding ourselves, we use pre-trained GloVe embeddings distributed by its authors. We aim to replicate the effects that may be found in real applications to the extent possible, and using pre-trained embeddings minimizes the choices available to us and simplifies reproducing our results. We pick the largest of the four corpora for which the\n8/14\nGloVe authors provide trained embeddings, which is a \u201cCommon Crawl\u201d corpus obtained from a large-scale crawl of the web, containing 840 billion tokens (roughly, words). Tokens in this corpus are case-sensitive and there are 2.2 million different ones, each corresponding to a 300-dimensional vector. The large size of this corpus and the resulting model is important to us, since it enables us to find word vectors for even relatively uncommon names. An important limitation is that there are no vectors for multi-word phrases.\nWe can expect similar results to the ones presented here if we used other corpora and/or embedding algorithms. For example, we repeated all the WEAT and WEFAT experiments presented above using a different pre-trained embedding: word2vec on a Google News corpus (Mikolov and Dean, 2013). In all experiments, we observed statistically significant effects and high effect sizes. Further, we found that the gender association strength of occupation words is highly correlated between the GloVe embedding and the word2vec embedding (Pearson \u03c1 = 0.88; Spearman \u03c1 = 0.86). In concurrent work, Bolukbasi et al. (2016) compared the same two embeddings, using a different measure of the gender bias of occupation words, also finding a high correlation (Spearman \u03c1 = 0.81)."}, {"heading": "Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT)", "text": "To demonstrate and quantify bias, we use the permutation test. Borrowing terminology from the IAT literature, consider two sets of target words (e.g., programmer, engineer, scientist, ... and nurse, teacher, librarian, ...) and two sets of attribute words (e.g., man, male, ... and woman, female ...). The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the two sets of target words in terms of their relative similarity to the two sets of attribute words. The permutation test measures the (un)likelihood of the null hypothesis by computing the probability that a random permutation of the attribute words would produce the observed (or greater) difference in sample means.\nIn formal terms, let X and Y be two sets of target words of equal size, and A,B the two sets of attribute words. Let cos(~a,~b) denote the cosine of the angle between the vectors~a and~b.\n\u2022 The test statistic is s(X ,Y,A,B) = \u2211\nx\u2208X s(x,A,B)\u2212\u2211 y\u2208Y s(y,A,B)\nwhere s(w,A,B) = meana\u2208Acos(~w,~a)\u2212meanb\u2208Bcos(~w,~b)\nIn other words, s(w,A,B) measures the association of the word w with the attribute, and s(X ,Y,A,B) measures the differential association of the two sets of target words with the attribute.\n\u2022 Let {(Xi,Yi)}i denote all the partitions of X \u222aY into two sets of equal size.

The \u201csubjects\u201d in our experiments are words, not people. While the IAT can measure the differential association between a single pair of target concepts and an attribute, the WEAT can only measure the differential association between two sets of target concepts and an attribute."}, {"heading": "Word Embedding Factual Association Test (WEFAT)", "text": "To understand and demonstrate the necessity of human bias in word embeddings, we also wish to examine how word embeddings capture empirical information about the world, which is also embedded in language. Consider a set of target concepts, such as occupations, and a real-valued, factual property of the world associated with each concept, such as the percentage of workers in the occupation who are women. We\u2019d like to test if the vectors corresponding to the concepts embed knowledge of the property, that is, if there is an algorithm that can extract or predict the property given the vector. In principle we could use any algorithm, but in this work we test the association of the target concept with some set of attribute words, analogous to WEAT above.\nFormally, consider a single set of target words W and two sets of attribute words A,B. There is a property pw associated with each word w \u2208W .\n9/14\n\u2022 The statistic associated with each word vector is a normalized association score of the word with the attribute:\ns(w,A,B) = meana\u2208Acos(~w,~a)\u2212meanb\u2208Bcos(~w,~b)\nstd-devx\u2208A\u222aBcos(~w,~x)\n\u2022 The null hypothesis is that there is no association between s(w,A,B) and pw. We test the null hypothesis using a linear regression analysis to predict the latter from the former.\nNow we discuss in more detail how we apply WEFAT in two cases. The first is to test if occupation word vectors embed knowledge of the gender composition of the occupation in the real world. We use data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in which occupations are categorized hierarchically, and for each occupation the number of workers and percentage of women are given (some data is missing). The chief difficulty is that many occupation names are multi-word terms whereas word vectors represent single words. Our strategy is to convert a multi-word term into a single word that represents a superset of the category (e.g., chemical engineer\u2192 engineer), and filter out occupations where this is not possible.\nOur second application of WEFAT is to test if androgynous names embed knowledge of how often the name is given to boys versus girls. We picked the most popular names in each 10% window of gender frequency based on 1990 U.S. Census data. Here again there is a difficulty: some names are also regular English words (e.g., Will). State-of-the-art word embeddings are not yet sophisticated enough to handle words with multiple senses or meanings; all usages are lumped into a single vector. To handle this, we algorithmically determine how \u201cname-like\u201d each vector is (by computing the distance of each vector to the centroid of all the name vectors), and eliminate the 20% of vectors that are least name-like.\nWe plan to make the code used to generate our results publicly available.5"}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": "We have shown that machine learning can acquire prejudicial biases from training data that reflect historical injustice. This is not entirely a new finding. A recent line of work on fairness in machine learning tries to minimize or avoid such biases (Dwork et al., 2012; Feldman et al., 2015; Zemel et al., 2013; Barocas and Selbst, 2014). However, unlike this literature, our setting is not a particular, explicit decision-making task (known as \u201cclassification\u201d in machine learning), but rather the often unconscious consequences of all of language. We show for the first time that if AI is to exploit via our language the vast knowledge that culture has compiled, it will inevitably inherit human-like prejudices. In other words, if AI learns enough about the properties of language to be able to understand and produce it, it also acquires cultural associations that can be offensive, objectionable, or harmful. These are much broader concerns than intentional discrimination, and possibly harder to address. This distinction informs much of the rest of this section.\nImplications for understanding human prejudice The simplicity and strength of our results suggests a new null hypothesis for explaining origins of prejudicial behavior in humans, namely, the implicit transmission of ingroup/outgroup identity information through language. That is, before providing an explicit or institutional explanation for why individuals make decisions that disadvantage one group with regards to another, one must show that the unjust decision was not a simple outcome of unthinking reproduction of statistical regularities absorbed with language. Similarly, before positing complex models for how prejudicial attitudes perpetuate from one generation to the next or from one group to another, we must check whether simply learning language is sufficient to explain the observed transmission of prejudice. These new null hypotheses are important not because we necessarily expect them to be true in most cases, but because Occam\u2019s razor now requires that we eliminate them, or at least quantify findings about prejudice in comparison to what is explainable from language transmission alone.\nOur work lends credence to the highly parsimonious theory that all that is needed to create prejudicial discrimination is not malice towards others, but preference for one\u2019s ingroup (Greenwald and Pettigrew, 2014). This theory is also supported by recent results showing that in times of conflict, rather than an increase in ingroup altruism, we see a decrease in baseline altruism towards the outgroup (Silva and Mace, 2015). Our results also both explain and support empirical results from education indicating that reducing prejudice requires directed interventions to facilitate \u201cdecategorizing and recategorizing outgroups\u201d (Dessel, 2010, p. 411). Simple contact with members of other groups is not enough. There needs to be specific bridging experiences to facilitating the construction of new identities or to develop skills to work with people across group boundaries.\nIt has been known for some time that even newborn infants attend foremost to speakers sharing their mother\u2019s dialect (Kinzler et al., 2007); it has been conjectured that such ingroup signaling may even account for the origins of music and language (Fitch, 2004). What we have shown here is that language identifies not only one\u2019s own group, but also which group\n5We thank Will Lowe for assistance with the methods WEAT and WEFAT that greatly improved the methodology.\n10/14\nis currently culturally dominant, or dominates particular regions of a culture. This may account for why in the IAT, Koreans and Japanese people living in their own countries each associate the other as \u2018less pleasant,\u2019 but African Americans show European-American-oriented biases, though not as strongly as European Americans (Greenwald et al., 1998). The dominance of European-American orientation may change as the American demography changes; indeed it would be interesting to examine corpora consisting of newspapers or other public language in towns or cities with different demographic makeup, particularly where racial diversity is also represented consistently in public offices and media.\nOf course, neither our work nor any other theory explaining the origins of prejudice justify prejudiced behavior. Humans are (or can be) good at using explicit knowledge to better cooperate, including choosing to behave fairly. Lee (2016) has shown very recently that the level of implicit bias displayed by subjects in the IAT does not predict cooperative performance. In other words, the learned biases that affect rate of comprehension of test stimuli or construction of artificial pairings does not affect deliberate choices about how to treat others, at least not in a laboratory setting. However, we have demonstrated here that a known case of prejudicial decision making (about inviting job candidates, cf. Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004) can be replicated by biases latent in language. We therefore recommend continuing the program of research examining behavior that does and does not correlate to human subject performance in the IAT. We recommend using our text processing tools to check pilot predictions for likely IAT performance on comparisons where none is currently known.\nConsequences of bias in humans and machines We have shown that AI can and does inherit substantially the same biases that humans exhibit. However, the consequences of bias are different in humans and machine-learning systems. Bias in AI is important because AI is increasingly given agency in our society, for tasks ranging from predictive text in search to determining criminal sentences assigned by courts. Yet machines are artifacts, owned and controlled by humans operators. That means that learning can be shut off completely once a product is put into production or operation, and this is frequently done to create more efficient and uniform experiences. Such an approach opens a potential downside: we may enshrine an imperfect procedure in a context where it will not be routinely reexamined by other humans. Such artifacts could persist and perpetuate biases in society for a long time \u2014 digital analogs of Robert Moses\u2019s racially motivated overpasses (Winner, 1980).\nOne advantage of AI, at least where the algorithms and outcomes are open to inspection, is that it can at least make such errors explicit and therefore potentially subject to monitoring and correction. After all, the same dependencies on history we have uncovered here may very well also pollute individual expectations, public policy, and even law. Natural intelligence and learning, just as in artifacts, may pick upon correlations without considering sufficiently carefully whether there is any causal relationship, or whether the correlation is caused by some other unobserved factor, possibly a correctable injustice."}, {"heading": "Effects of bias in NLP applications", "text": "To better understand the potential impact of bias in word embeddings, let us consider applications where they have found use. Sentiment analysis classifies text as being positive, negative, or neutral. Two of its uses are in marketing to quantify customer satisfaction (say, from a set of product reviews) and in finance to predict market trends (say, from tweets about companies). Consider a straw-man sentiment analysis technique based on word embeddings: calculate the valence of each word based on its association with designated positive and negative words, then sum up the sentiment scores. Now consider applying this technique to movie reviews. Our results show that European-American names have more positive valence than African-American names in a state-of-the-art word embedding. That means a sentence containing a European-American name will have a higher sentiment score than a sentence with that name replaced by an African-American name. In other words, the tool will display a racial bias in its output based on actor and character names.\nWe picked this example because the argument follows directly from our experiments on names. But our results suggest that other imprints of human racial prejudice, not confined to names, will also be picked up by machine-learning models. Besides, bias is known to creep in indirectly, by proxy (Barocas and Selbst, 2014). Thus, it would be simplistic to conclude that we can fix the problem by withholding names from the inputs to NLP applications.\nNext, consider statistical machine translation (SMT). Unsurprisingly, today\u2019s SMT systems reflect existing gender stereotypes. Translations to English from many gender-neutral languages such as Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian, Persian, and Turkish lead to gender-stereotyped sentences. For example, Google Translate converts these Turkish sentences with genderless pronouns: \u201cO bir doktor. O bir hems\u0327ire.\u201d to these English sentences: \u201cHe is a doctor. She is a nurse.\u201d A test of the 50 occupation words used in the results presented in Figure 1 shows that the pronoun is translated to \u201che\u201d in the majority of cases and \u201cshe\u201d in about a quarter of cases; tellingly, we found that the gender association of the word vectors almost perfectly predicts which pronoun will appear in the translation."}, {"heading": "Challenges in addressing bias", "text": "Redresses such as transparent development of AI technology and improving diversity and ethical training of developers, while useful, do little to address the kind of prejudicial bias we expose here. Unfortunately, our work points to several additional\n11/14\nreasons why addressing bias in machine learning will be harder than one might expect. First, our results suggest that word embeddings don\u2019t merely pick up specific, enumerable biases such as gender stereotypes (Bolukbasi et al., 2016), but rather the entire spectrum of human biases reflected in language. In fact, we show that bias is meaning. Bias is identical to meaning, and it is impossible to employ language meaningfully without incorporating human bias. This is why we term unacceptable bias prejudice in this paper. The biases we reveal aren\u2019t about a particular application of machine learning, but rather about the basic representation of knowledge \u2014 used possibly in human cognition, and certainly in an expanding variety of AI applications.\nSecond, the idea of correcting even prejudiced biases is also problematic. That is because societal understanding of prejudice is constantly evolving, along with our understanding of humanity and human rights, and also varies between cultures. It is therefore hard or impossible to specify algorithmically what is prejudiced. To give one example, Monteith and Pettit (2011) using the IAT show that people with mental illnesses are stigmatized compared to people with physical illnesses \u2014 a result we have also replicated in word embeddings (but not reported above). Is this a prejudice? Who determines whether it should be corrected?\nThird and finally, we have shown that biases result from extant as well as historic inequalities in the world. There may be many other contexts where these inequalities are important to know about. More generally, shared awareness of the real world is important for communication (Zue, 1985; Barsalou, 2009). Consider the gender stereotypes in occupations. If we were using machine learning to evaluate the suitability of job applicants, these stereotypes would be bad. Yet if the task was to analyze historical job ads and infer if more men or women worked in those roles, the stereotypical associations would be exactly the information we would wish to utilize. The gender associations we found in the word embeddings of names might be exceedingly useful, yet those same associations might lead to prejudicial expectations concerning names and occupations. Remedies must be tailored to applications. Within a given context, such as college admissions, we can decide whether (and to what extent) considerations of fairness should override the usual focus on predictive accuracy (as is the case with affirmative action), but it is not meaningful to do this devoid of context. Put simply, eliminating bias is eliminating information; eliminating prejudice takes more thought.\nAwareness is better than blindness For these reasons, we view the approach of \u201cdebiasing\u201d word embeddings (Bolukbasi et al., 2016) with skepticism. If we view AI as perception followed by action, debiasing alters the AI\u2019s perception (and model) of the world, rather than how it acts on that perception. This gives the AI an incomplete understanding of the world. We see debiasing as \u201cfairness through blindness\u201d.6 It has its place, but also important limits: prejudice can creep back in through proxies (although we should note that Bolukbasi et al. (2016) do consider \u201cindirect bias\u201d in their paper). Efforts to fight prejudice at the level of the initial representation will necessarily hurt meaning and accuracy, and will themselves be hard to adapt as societal understanding of fairness evolves.\nInstead, we take inspiration from the fact that humans can express behavior different from their implicit biases (Lee, 2016). Human intelligence is typified by behavior integrating multiple forms of memory and evidence (Purcell and Kiani, 2016; Bear and Rand, 2016). It includes the capacity to recall one-shot exposure to highly context-specific information in the form of rules and instructions. We can learn that \u201cprejudice is bad\u201d, that \u201cwomen used to be trapped in their homes and men in their careers, but now gender doesn\u2019t necessarily determine family role\u201d and so forth. If AI is not built in a similar way, then it would be possible for prejudice absorbed by machine learning to have a much greater negative impact than when prejudice is absorbed in the same way by children. This is because children also receive other kinds of instruction and social examples as a part of the ordinary, painstaking process of child rearing. Normally when we design AI architectures, we try to keep them as simple as possible to facilitate our capacity to debug and maintain AI systems. However, where AI is partially constructed automatically by machine learning of human culture, we may also need an analog of human explicit memory and deliberate actions, that can be trained or programmed to avoid the expression of prejudice.\nOf course, such an approach doesn\u2019t lend itself to a straightforward algorithmic formulation. Instead it requires a long-term, interdisciplinary research program that includes cognitive scientists and ethicists. One concrete suggestion for the present is to choose corpora for training machine learning to have as little prejudice as possible \u2014 the tools we have presented here can be used to identify these. Another is that given the vulnerability of relying on purely statistical information for understanding and operating within a culture, it may be advisable to consider more complex AI architectures such as cognitive systems (Tho\u0301risson, 2007; Hanheide et al., 2015). Heterogeneous approaches to representing knowledge and intelligence may allow us to exploit both the great strengths of machine learning and the instructability of symbolic systems."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We are grateful to the following people: Will Lowe for substantial assistance in the design of our significance tests, Tim Macfarlane for his pilot research as a part of his undergraduate dissertation, Solon Barocas and Miles Brundage for excellent comments on an early version of this paper.\n6Our use of this term is inspired by Dwork et al.

However, there are concerns that these technologies may be used, either with or without intention, to perpetuate the prejudice and unfairness that unfortunately characterizes many human institutions.

We replicate a spectrum of standard human biases as exposed by the Implicit Association Test and other well-known psychological studies. We replicate these using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model\u2014namely, the GloVe word embedding\u2014trained on a corpus of text from the Web. Our results indicate that language itself contains recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether these are morally neutral as towards insects or flowers, problematic as towards race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo for the distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. These regularities are captured by machine learning along with the rest of semantics. In addition to our empirical findings concerning language, we also contribute new methods for evaluating bias in text, the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) and the Word Embedding Factual Association Test (WEFAT). Our results have implications not only for AI and machine learning, but also for the fields of psychology, sociology, and human ethics, since they raise the possibility that mere exposure to everyday language can account for the biases we replicate here.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
