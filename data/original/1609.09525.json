Dictionary-based representations proceed by approximating a signal with a linear combination of elements, referred to as dictionary atoms, where the dictionary is either given based on the domain knowledge, or learned from a signal database [48]. The state-of-the-art mostly considers overcomplete dictionaries; in such cases the signal decomposition is not unique, requiring to select a decomposition with specific constraints or properties. One such property is the sparsity, where the signal decomposition involves but a few atoms; the trade-off between the number of such atoms and the approximation error is controlled via a weighted penalization term. Despite their good properties, sparse decompositions are sensitive w.r.t. the data noise [15], particularly so when the dictionary atoms are highly correlated.\nThis paper focuses on preserving the structure of the signal through the dictionary-based decomposition, thereby expectedly decreasing its sensitivity w.r.t. noise. The proposed approach is motivated by, and illustrated on, spatiotemporal multi-dimensional signals, referred to as multi-channel signals. The decomposition of multi-channel signals involves: i) decomposing each channel into the dictionary (see [41] for a survey); ii) ensuring that the structure of the multi-channel data is preserved in the multi-dimensional decomposition.\nFollowing and extending previous work [27], this paper focuses on structured dictionary-based decomposition, where the dictionary-based representation preserves the structure of the signal, as follows. Assuming that each one of the mono-dimensional signals is structured (e.g. being recorded in consecutive time samples and being continuous w.r.t. time), the structured decomposition property aims at preserving the signal structure in the dictionary-based representation (e.g. requiring that the approximation of signals in consecutive time steps is expressed on same atoms with \u201cclose\u201d weights). Formally, the structured decomposition property is enforced via considering a specific regularization term besides the data fitting term (minimization of the approximation error) and the standard `1 term (maximizing the decomposition sparsity). The main contribution of this paper is to propose an efficient optimization scheme based on the split Bregman iterations for performing this structured decomposition of multi-dimensional signals. Implementation details including an efficient heuristic for hyper-parameters tuning is provided to accelerate the proposed algorithm. The proposed Multi-dimensional Sparse Structured Signal Approximation (Multi-SSSA) is assessed on synthetic signals for the fusedLASSO regularization obtained when the analysis term is a TV penalty. The approach is assessed in terms of i) its computational cost compared with the state-of-the-art smooth proximal gradient [9] approach; ii) its ability to recover the sparse structure of the initial signals compared with standard sparsity constraints and fused LASSO (`0, `2,0, `1, `2,1 and `1 + `2,1) even though the true structure of the signal is used to define the fused-LASSO regularization. Finally, Multi-SSSA is applied on electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to detect P300 evoked potentials. Using a data-driven prior, the structured decomposition approach is shown to effectively denoise the signal, resulting in a better\nclassification accuracy compared to the other regularizations. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the formal background. Related work is discussed in Section 3. Section 4 gives an overview of the proposed Multi-SSSA algorithm and the optimization strategy. The experimental validation of the approach on artificial data in terms of computational cost and structure recovery is presented and discussed respectively in Sections 5.2 and 5.3. Section 6 presents the denoising application on EEG signals. The paper concludes with a general discussion and points out some perspectives in Section 7.\nNotations..

We consider the following linear model:\nY (t) = \u03a6X(t) + E(t), t \u2208 {1, . . . , T} , Y = \u03a6X + E , (1)\nin which X = [X(1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , X(T )] \u2208 RN\u03a6\u00d7T is the decomposition matrix and E = [E(1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , E(T )] \u2208 RC\u00d7T stands for a Gaussian noise matrix.\nThe sparse structured approximation problem consists in decomposing each signal Y (t), t \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , T} onto the dictionary such that the joint decomposition X reflects the underlying structure of Y . This decomposition aims at removing the Gaussian noise present in these signals and at separating theirs components into target and non-target ones (depending on the considered application). The structured decomposition problem is formalized as the minimization of the objective function:\nmin X\u2208RN\u03a6\u00d7T\n\u2016Y \u2212 \u03a6X\u201622 + \u03bb1\u2016X\u20161 + \u03bb2\u2016XP\u20161 , (2)\nwith \u03bb1, \u03bb2 the regularization coefficients and P \u2208 RT\u00d7NP a matrix encoding the prior knowledge about the signal structure. The use of the \u2016XP\u20161 regularization term can be interpreted in terms of sparse analysis [17]. Classically, the sparse analysis decomposition problem is formalized as follows:\nmin X\u2208RC\u00d7T\n\u2016Y \u2212X\u201622 + \u03bb1\u2016\u03a8X\u20161 , (3)\nwhereas the synthesis problem writes as minX \u2016Y \u2212 \u03a6X\u201622 + \u03bb1\u2016X\u20161. In the analysis setting, atoms in the dictionary \u03a8 are viewed as filters, on which the projection of the decomposed signals are required to be sparse. Along this line, the P matrix can be viewed as a set of linear filters, on which the projections of the decomposed signals are required to be sparse, thereby preserving the regularities given from prior knowledge about the application domain. The matrix P can be learned from a set of signals [39, 42].\nThe present paper considers a synthesis formulation of the problem, regularized by an analysis term. In order to illustrate the interest of such decomposition, the particular case of the multi-dimensional fused-LASSO is described below."}, {"heading": "2.2. Multi-dimensional fused-LASSO problem", "text": "In the particular case of a piecewise constant prior, a block-wise decomposition is expected.

In the studied model, adding an `1 and a multi-dimensional TV regularization terms allows to enforce such prior. The TV term leads to a sparse decomposition gradient, thus preserving signal singularities and data edges, and supporting the detection of abrupt changes [43]. The analysis term is then written:\n\u2016XPTV\u20161 = \u2211T t=2 \u2016X(t)\u2212X(t\u2212 1)\u20161, where\nPTV =  \u22121 1 \u22121 1 . . . . . . \u22121\n1\n \u2208 RT\u00d7T\u22121 .\nThe Figure 1 depicts an example of time-series coefficients obtained in this case, i.e. with sparse variations, for a given atom of the dictionary (in grey).

Related work", "text": "Quite a few methods have been designed in the last decade to achieve the sparse approximation [11] of multi-dimensional signals while the monodimensional case has been intensively studied. Two main approaches have been considered: greedy methods trying to approximate the solution of the `0 regularized problem [50] and convex optimization solvers working on the `1 relaxed problem [49, 23, 41]. The concept of structured sparsity then emerged from the integration of prior knowledge encoded as regularizations into these approximation problems [26, 29]. The proposed Multi-SSSA approach falls in the latter category with a regularization combining a classical sparsity term and an analysis one. Some analysis regularizations have been extensively studied like the TV one which has been introduced in the ROF model [43, 13] for image denoising, nonetheless in the context of dictionary-based decomposition, their study has only begun recently [44, 51, 36]. Their interest for retrieving the underlying sparse structure of signals has been shown in [8]. To the best of our knowledge, the combination of these regularization terms had not been studied except for the particular case of the fused-LASSO introduced in [46].\nDespite the convexity of the associated minimization problem, the two `1 non-differentiable terms make it difficult to solve (by classical gradient approaches). Various approaches have been developed for solving the fused-LASSO problem. In their seminal work, Tibshirani et al. [46] transformed the problem to a quadratic one and used standard optimization tools. While this approach proved computationally feasible for small-sized problems since it relies on increasing the dimension of the search space, it does not scale efficiently with problem size. Path algorithms have then been developed: Hoefling proposed in\n[24] a method solving this problem in the particular case of the fused-LASSO signal approximator (\u03a6 = IC) and Tibshirani et al. [47] designed a path method for the generalized LASSO problem. More recently, scalable approaches based on proximal sub-gradient methods [34], ADMM1[53] and split Bregman iterations [56] have been successfully applied to the mono-dimensional generalized fused-LASSO. Concerning the multi-dimensional fused-LASSO, an efficient method has been proposed recently in [9] for multi-task regression. A proximal method [37] is applied to a smooth approximation of the fused-LASSO regularization terms in this study and can be considered for different analysis regularizations. This approach is the most comparable with the present work.\nTo conclude this state-of-the-art, an illustration of the different regularizations is plotted in Figure 2: `2 (top left), `1 [45] (top right), `2,1 [57] (middle left), `1 + `2,1 [22] (middle right), TV [43] (bottom right) and `1 + TV (bottom right).\n1Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers.\nThis figure also illustrates the interest of structurally constrained regularizations in various noisy situations. Many concrete applications entail extracting specific activities (signal space or target activities) from the original signals, therefore getting rid of various kind of noise, defined as spurious/non target activities. While target and non-target activities often share a few properties (statistical distribution, spatial and temporal structures), the introduction of structurally constrained regularizations aims at drastically limiting the resulting space to signals exhibiting the desired properties."}, {"heading": "4.

A = X and B = XP . (5)\nThis reformulation is a key step of the split Bregman method. It decouples the three terms and allows to optimize them separately within the iterations. To setup this iteration scheme, Eq.

Each iteration requires the solving of the primal problem before updating the dual variables. Thanks to the split of the three terms, the minimization of the primal problem Eq. (6) can be performed iteratively by alternatively updating the following variables:\nXi+1 = argmin X\u2208RN\u03a6\u00d7T \u2016Y \u2212 \u03a6X\u201622 + \u00b51 2 \u2016X \u2212Ai +DiA\u201622\n+ \u00b52 2 \u2016XP \u2212Bi +DiB\u201622 (7)\nAi+1 = argmin A\u2208RN\u03a6\u00d7T\n\u03bb1\u2016A\u20161 + \u00b51 2 \u2016Xi+1 \u2212A+DiA\u201622 (8)\nBi+1 = argmin B\u2208RN\u03a6\u00d7NP \u03bb2\u2016B\u20161 + \u00b52 2 \u2016Xi+1P \u2212B +DiB\u201622 . (9)\nEmpirically, it has been noted that only few iterations of this system are necessary for convergence [20]. In our implementation, this update is only performed once at each iteration of the global optimization algorithm.\nEq. (8) and Eq. (9) can be solved with the soft-thresholding operator [10]:\nAi+1 = SoftThreshold \u03bb1 \u00b51 (Xi+1 +DiA), (10) Bi+1 = SoftThreshold \u03bb2 \u00b52 (Xi+1P +DiB) (11)\nwith\n(SoftThreshold \u03bb (X))(i, j) = max\n( 0, 1\u2212 \u03bb\n|X(i, j)|\n) X(i, j).\nSolving Eq. (7) requires the minimization of a convex differentiable function which can be performed via classical optimization methods. We propose here to solve it deterministically which is an original contribution of this work. Let us define H from Eq. (7) such as:\nXi+1 = argmin X\u2208RN\u03a6\u00d7T H(X) . (12)\nDifferentiating this expression with respect to X yields:\nd\ndX H(X) = (2\u03a6T\u03a6 + \u00b51IN\u03a6)X +X(\u00b52PP T ) (13)\n\u2212 2\u03a6TY + \u00b51(DiA \u2212Ai) + \u00b52(DiB \u2212Bi)PT ,\nThe minimum X\u0302 = Xi+1 of Eq. (7) is obtained by solving ddXH(X\u0302) = 0, which is known as a Sylvester equation:\nWX\u0302 + X\u0302Z = M i , (14)\nwith W = 2\u03a6T\u03a6 + \u00b51IN\u03a6 \u2208 RN\u03a6\u00d7N\u03a6 , Z = \u00b52PPT \u2208 RT\u00d7T and M i = 2\u03a6TY + \u00b51(A\ni \u2212DiA) + \u00b52(Bi \u2212DiB)PT \u2208 RN\u03a6\u00d7T . In a general setting, solving efficiently a Sylvester equation can be timeconsuming when the dimension of these matrices are large. A closed form solution derived from the vectorized formulation can be computed but it requires heavy calculations. One of the most used methods to deal with this issue, is the Bartels\u2013Stewart algorithm [2] whose time complexity is O(N3\u03a6). In our particular case, the structures of the involved matrices ease this update.\nIndeed, W and Z being real symmetric matrices, solving for X\u0302 the Sylvester equation WX\u0302 + X\u0302Z = M i is equivalent to solve for X\u0302 \u2032 the following diagonal system\nDwX\u0302 \u2032 + X\u0302 \u2032Dz = M i\u2032 , (15)\nwhere\nW = FDwF T , Z = GDzG T , (16) X\u0302 \u2032 = FT X\u0302G, M i\u2032 = FTM iG .\nW and Z can be diagonalized in orthogonal bases (F and G) which allow to rewrite the Sylvester equation as follows:\nFDwF T X\u0302 + X\u0302GDzG T = M i ,\nand by applying the orthogonal properties of F and G the above expression is obtained. The solution X\u0302 \u2032 of the problem Eq.(15) is then computed as follows:\n\u2200t \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , T} X\u0302 \u2032(t) = (Dw +Dz(t, t)IN\u03a6)\u22121M i\u2032(t) ,\nwhich is equivalent to\n\u2200n \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N\u03a6}, \u2200t \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , T} , (Dw(n, n) +Dz(t, t)) X\u0302 \u2032(n, t) = M i\u2032(n, t) , (17)\nwhich can be computed with\nX\u0302 \u2032 = M i\u2032 O , (18)\nwhere corresponds to an element-wise division and\nO(n, t) = Dw(n, n) +Dz(t, t) . (19)\nX\u0302 is then calculated as X\u0302 = FX\u0302 \u2032GT . This last update can be numerically unstable when the elements of O are close to 0. As a consequence, \u00b51 and \u00b52 should be chosen carefully to avoid numerical instabilities. In addition, some terms can be precomputed to speed up the computations performed during each iteration.

Hence, if T \u2265 NP then FT ((DiB \u2212 Btemp)PG) is computed, otherwise (FT (DiB \u2212Btemp))PG is computed.\nThe choice of \u00b51 and \u00b52 has a crucial impact on the rate of convergence. On the one hand, they should be chosen to get a great conditioning of the primal problem. On the other hand, these parameters can be updated during the\niterations to improve this rate as it is classically done in augmented Lagrangian methods [4].\nA poor conditioning of the primal update appears when these parameters are too small. The subproblem written in Eq. (7) becomes numerically unstable when the elements of the matrix O(n, t) = Dw(n, n) + Dz(t, t) are close to 0. The eigenvalues of W = 2\u03a6T\u03a6 + \u00b51IN\u03a6 and Z = \u00b52PP\nT are non-negative and their smallest values depend on the penalty parameters. Let {\u03bbw(n),\u2200n \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N\u03a6}} and {\u03bbz(t),\u2200t \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , T}} be respectively the eigenvalues of 2\u03a6T\u03a6 and PPT , we have:\nmin n,t O(n, t) = min n \u03bbw(n) + \u00b51 + \u00b52 min t \u03bbz(t) . (24)\nWhen \u03a6 is an overcomplete dictionary, minn \u03bbw(n) = 0 since this is the minimal singular value of \u03a6. Thus, depending on the eigenvalues of PPT , \u00b51 and \u00b52 should be chosen carefully to avoid numerical instability.\nAn update of these parameters during the iterations can speed up the convergence. As seen before, the split Bregman scheme is equivalent to the augmented Lagrangian one when the constraints are linear. Thus, a common strategy used in the augmented Lagrangian scheme has been chosen here to update the penalty parameters: when the loss associated with a constraint does not decrease enough between two iterations, the corresponding parameter is increased. Formally, let h1(X,A) = \u2016X\u2212A\u20162 and h2(X,B) = \u2016XP \u2212B\u20162 be the constraints losses, the parameters are updated as follows,\n\u00b5i1 =  \u00b5 i\u22121 1 if h1(X i, Ai) < r1h1(X i\u22121, Ai\u22121)\n\u03c11\u00b5 i\u22121 1 otherwise\n(25)\nand\n\u00b5i2 =  \u00b5 i\u22121 2 if h2(X i, Bi) < r2h2(X i\u22121, Bi\u22121)\n\u03c12\u00b5 i\u22121 2 otherwise\n(26)\nwhere r1, r2 are the threshold parameters and \u03c11, \u03c12 are the ratios of the geometric progressions \u00b51, \u00b52.\nTo achieve a fast convergence, the initialization of these parameters should not enforce the constraints too strictly in the first iterations but these parameters must not be setup with a value too small in order to not affect the resolution of the primal problem. A heuristic is described here to ease the initialization of \u00b51 and \u00b52. This procedure has been shown to be empirically efficient:\n1. define a search grid g for \u00b51 and \u00b52, 2. perform the first iteration of the optimization scheme for each couple of\nparameters [g(j), g(l)], 3. evaluate t1(j, l) = \u00b51 2 h1(X(j, l) 1, A(j, l)1)2 and t2(j, l) = \u00b52 2 h2(X(j, l) 1, B(j, l)1)2\nfor each couple, 4. initialize \u00b501 and \u00b5 0 2 with:\n\u00b501 = g(argmax j \u2211 l t1(j, l)) ,\n\u00b502 = g(argmax l \u2211 j t2(j, l)) ."}, {"heading": "4.4.

Then, both methods are executed and stopped only when the relative difference between the current cost and the value of the loss at the optimum is under a fixed precision. Three experiments have been performed to assess the computational time of both methods when different dimensions of our problem are varying. Their respective setups are described in Figure 5.

Both methods have been implemented using MATLAB (64 bits). The experiments have been performed on a PC with 16GB RAM and a 8-core processor. Concerning the proximal approach, the minimization is performed by the classical FISTA method as in [9]. More precisely, the variant named \u201dFISTA with backtracking\u201d in [3] has been chosen. The Lipschitzien coefficient L of the smooth term\u2019s gradient is approximated then with a variable following a geometrical progression: Li = \u03c1kLi\u22121 with \u03c1 = 1.05 and L0 = 1. Besides, the parameter \u00b5 balancing the compromise between the analysis (TV) penalty and its smooth version is chosen such that the precision desired on the solution could be reached. A tight bound of the distance between the strict cost and the smooth one is known theoretically [9] and is proportional to \u00b5.

As expected, for both methods, the computation time is almost not affected by the number of channels. The observed increase of computation time is due to the computation of the stopping criteria at each iteration. Two more observations can be derived from these curves. Firstly, the split Bregman method is faster than the proximal gradient one in all cases presented here (for all precisions: 10\u22124, 10\u22125 and 10\u22126) and the curves have the same shapes. Secondly, the differences in speed between these approaches become more important when the desired precision becomes smaller. This last observation can be understood by noticing that the gradient\u2019s Lipschitzien coefficient of the smooth TV penalty presented in [9] is inversely proportional to the parameter \u00b5. As this coefficient corresponds to the inverse of the FISTA gradient step coefficient, when \u00b5 becomes smaller (insuring a small gap) the gradient step becomes smaller and the method is then slower."}, {"heading": "5.3.

On the contrary, when many atoms are active simultaneously, the multi-dimensional fused-LASSO outperforms the LASSO model, allowing better retrieval of the block-wise structures of signals by using inter-signals prior information. Concerning the `2,1 (and `2,0) regularization terms, results depend more on the duration of patterns. When patterns are longer, their performances are similar to the fused-LASSO one. On the contrary, when patterns have short/medium durations the group-LASSO model is outperformed. This is not surprising since these regularization terms select atoms for the entire duration of the signals. As expected the `1 +`2,1 model combines the advantages of the `1 and `2,1 regularization terms, having same performances as the fused-LASSO for both small number of patterns or long ones.

Detection of P300 evoked potentials", "text": "The P300 is one of the most popular evoked potential used within Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) systems. The P300 speller introduced in [18] allows for instance to spell words (letter by letter) by detecting such potentials after the presentation of visual stimuli. These potentials are usually elicited by presenting a rare target stimulus among common non-target ones (oddball approach). The P300 wave appears between 250 and 450 ms after the target stimulus and is mainly located in the parietal and the occipital lobes. Its latency and amplitude depend on various factors like the target-to-target intervals (see [40] for a review). The following experiment focuses on the single-trial detection of such brain activity. Each EEG measurement is a spatio-temporal signal which can be studied as a sum of electrical activities emitted by different neural assemblies. These activities are characterized by specific time course and spatial patterns which depend on the locations of their sources and the orientations of the associated electrical activities. In order to obtain plausible decompositions of such signals, the extracted components should respect the properties of these activities as the smoothness induced by the diffusion of electrical waves in the skull. The hypothesis in this experiment is that such plausible representations can be obtained via the studied regularization. The main components of these decompositions could then lead to a better identification of brain activities and in particular the components of the P300 potentials. Two types of noise must be removed: the sensors noise and the EEG background activities not related to the target activity. Since the components of the P300 potential are not known precisely, in order to evaluate the introduced regularization, the main components of the decompositions are used to reconstruct the signals.

Conclusion and perspectives", "text": "The studied approach enforces structural properties of the signal decomposition on the dictionary through the regularization term \u2016XP\u20161. The overall optimization problem is efficiently and scalably handled through the split Bregman method.\nRegarding the structural regularization term, a proof of principle of the approach is obtained in the particular case of the TV norm, conducive to the discovery of block-wise structures in the decomposition on overcomplete dictionaries: as shown in Section 5.3, the recovery of the block-wise structure of the input signals is significantly improved when using the `1 + TV regularization compared to other regularizations. In addition, the EEG experiment (Section 6) illustrates how the analysis term can be used to enforce structural properties on the decomposition in a data-driven way. It allows in this last case to denoise EEG signals and improve the single-trial detection of P300. The decompositions are guided to plausible components thank to an analysis matrix constructed from a dictionary of realistic EEG topographies.\nThe second contribution of the paper is the original split-Bregman method handling the underlying optimization problem, and its scalability compared with the state-of-the-art. As shown in Section 5.2, Multi-SSSA outperforms the smooth proximal gradient in terms of speed when the problem dimensions increase, and it is less sensitive w.r.t. the wanted precision. Furthermore, an empirically efficient heuristic procedure is proposed to adjust the penalty hyperparameters and thus preserve the efficiency of the algorithm. This efficiency is explained from the split-Bregman ability to early detect zero coefficients (see [20], Appendix), thereby easily accommodating `1 regularization. The main scalability limitation of the proposed scheme comes from the diagonalization of the matrix in Eq. (22), with cubic complexity in its size; it therefore requires the dictionary size N\u03a6 and/or T to remain in the hundreds. A second limitation regards the memory complexity, and the storage of variables involved in the method. To overcome these limitations, a method solving approximatively the primal subproblem Eq. (7) can be considered. Even if the exact solving of this subproblem allows to ensure the convergence of the proposed scheme, the split Bregman iterations have been shown empirically to converge even when the primal problem is not solved exactly. When N\u03a6 or NP become really large, this option can significantly reduce the computation time.\nFurther perspectives and on-going work are primarily concerned with carrying out a full evaluation of the presented EEG application, in particular to examine the influence of the dictionaries choices (spatial and time-frequency) on the denoising efficiency. In addition, an extension of the microstates EEG model will be studied with a TV regularization matrix [28]. Another direction of research is concerned with approximating the solution of the subproblem in Eq. (12), instead of solving it exactly. A mid-term research perspective is to learn both the dictionary \u03a6 and the regularities P from the data. While not rigorously shown in this paper, we believe that the proposed frame-\nwork provides with a rich panel of possibilities to filter signal of interest from noise and interference in various context and applications."}, {"heading": "Appendix A.

This theorem hold for \u03bb1 \u2265 0, \u03bb2 \u2265 0, \u00b51 > 0 and \u00b52 > 0.\nThe studied iterative algorithm consider at each iteration three convex subproblems Eq. (7), (8), (9). The first order optimality condition of these problems gives:\n0 = (2\u03a6T\u03a6 + \u00b51I)X i+1 + \u00b52X i+1PPT\n\u2212 2\u03a6TY + \u00b51(DiA \u2212Ai) + \u00b52(DiB \u2212Bi)PT , 0 = \u03bb1Q i+1 A \u2212 \u00b51(D i A \u2212Ai+1 +Xi+1) , 0 = \u03bb2Q i+1 B \u2212 \u00b52(D i B \u2212Bi+1 +Xi+1P ) , (A.1)\nDi+1A = D i A + (X i+1 \u2212Ai+1) , Di+1B = D i B + (X i+1P \u2212Bi+1) ,\nwhere Qi+1A \u2208 \u2202\u2016Ai+1\u20161 et Q i+1 B \u2208 \u2202\u2016Bi+1\u20161.\nIn addition, the convexity of the main problem Eq. (5) insures the existence of an unique solution which respect the KKT conditions. The Lagrangian L of the problem could thus be written:\nL = \u2016Y \u2212 \u03a6X\u20162F + \u03bb1\u2016X\u20161 + \u03bb2\u2016XP\u20161,\nand \u2203X\u0302 such that\n0 =\u2212 2\u03a6T (Y \u2212 \u03a6X\u0302) + \u03bb1Q\u0302A + \u03bb2Q\u0302BPT , (A.2) A\u0302 = X\u0302, and B\u0302 = X\u0302P ,\nwhere Q\u0302A \u2208 \u2202\u2016A\u0302\u20161 et Q\u0302B \u2208 \u2202\u2016B\u0302\u20161.

overcomplete families of vectors, called dictionaries. The contribution of the paper is threefold. Firstly, a generic spatio-temporal regularization term is designed and used together with the standard `1 regularization term to enforce a sparse decomposition preserving the spatio-temporal structure of the signal. Secondly, an optimization algorithm based on the split Bregman approach is proposed to handle the associated optimization problem, and its convergence is analyzed. Our well-founded approach yields same accuracy as the other algorithms at the state-of-the-art, with significant gains in terms of convergence speed. Thirdly, the empirical validation of the approach on artificial and real-world problems demonstrates the generality and effectiveness of the method. On artificial problems, the proposed regularization subsumes the Total Variation minimization and recovers the expected decomposition. On the real-world problem of electro-encephalography brainwave decomposition, the approach outperforms similar approaches in terms of P300 evoked potentials detection, using structured spatial priors to guide the decomposition.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
