Introduction", "text": "One fundamental problem in Reinforcement Learning (RL) is to learn the long-term expected reward, i.e. the value function, which can consequently be used for determining a good control policy, cf. Sutton and Barto (1998). In the general setting with large or infinite state space, exact representation of the actual value function is often inhibitively computationally expensive or hardly possible. To overcome this difficulty, function approximation techniques are employed for estimating the value function from sampled trajectories. The quality of the learned policy depends significantly on the chosen function approximation technique.\nIn this paper, we consider the technique of linear value function approximation. The value function is represented or approximated as a linear combination of a set of features, or basis functions. These features are generated from the sampled states via either some heuristic constructions, e.g. Bradtke and Barto (1996); Keller et al. (2006), or kernel-based approaches, e.g. Taylor and Parr (2009). A common approach generates firstly a vast number of features, which is often much larger than the number of available samples, and then chooses automatically relevant features to approximate the actual value function. Unfortunately, such approaches may fail completely due to overfitting. To cope with this situation, regularization techniques are necessarily to be employed. Other than the simple `2 regu-\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n01 47\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n5 O\nct 2\n01 6\nMeyer Shen Diepold\nlarization, which penalizes the smoothness of the learned value function, e.g. Farahmand et al. (2008), in this work we focus on `1 regularization. The `1 regularization often produces sparse solutions, thus can serve as a method of automatic feature selection for linear value function approximation.\nThis work focuses on the development of Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithms, cf. Bradtke and Barto (1996). Recent active researches on applying `1 regularization to TD learning have led to a various number of effective algorithms, e.g. Loth et al. (2007); Kolter and Ng (2009); Johns et al. (2010); Geist and Scherrer (2012); Hoffman et al. (2012). It is important to notice that `1 minimization has been extensively studied in the areas of compressed sensing and image processing, and many efficient `1 minimization algorithms have been developed, cf. Cande\u0301s and Romberg (2007); Zibulevsky and Elad (2010). Very recently, two advanced `1 minimization algorithms have been adapted to the TD learning, i.e. the Dantzig selector based TD algorithm from Geist et al. (2012) and the orthogonal matching pursuit based TD algorithm developed in Painter-Wakefield and Parr (2012a).\nOn the other hand, most TD learning algorithms are known to be unstable with linear value function approximation and off-policy learning. By observing the fact that most original forms of TD algorithms are not true gradient descent methods, a new class of intrinsic gradient TD (GTD) learning algorithms with linear value function approximation are developed and proven to be stable, cf. Sutton et al. (2008, 2009). However, it is important to know that success of GTD algorithms might be limited due to the fact that the GTD family requires a set of well chosen features. In other words, the GTD algorithms are in potential danger of overfitting. The key contribution of the present work is the development of a family of `1 regularized GTD algorithms, referred to as GTD-IST algorithms. Convergence properties of the proposed algorithms are investigated from the perspective of stochastic optimization.\nThe paper is outlined as follows. In Section 2, we briefly introduce a general setting of TD learning and provide some preliminaries of TD objective functions. Section 3 presents a framework of `1 regularized GTD learning algorithms, and investigates their convergence properties. In Section 4, several numerical experiments depict the practical performance of the proposed algorithms, compared with several existing `1 regularized TD algorithms. Finally, a conclusion is drawn in Section 5."}, {"heading": "2.

TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation", "text": "The goal of a RL agent is to learn a mapping from states to actions, i.e. a policy \u03c0 : S \u2192 A, which maximizes the value function V \u03c0 : S \u2192 R of a state s taking a policy \u03c0, defined as\nV \u03c0(s) := E [\u2211\u221e\nt=0\u03b3 tr(st)|s0 = s, \u03c0\n] . (1)\n`1 Regularized GTD Learning\nIt is well known that, for a given policy \u03c0, the value function V \u03c0 fulfills the Bellman equation, i.e.\nV \u03c0(s) = r(s) + \u03b3 \u2211 s\u2032 P (s, \u03c0(s), s\u2032)V \u03c0(s\u2032). (2)\nThe right hand side of (2) is often referred to as the Bellman operator for policy \u03c0, denoted by T V \u03c0(s). In other words, the value function V \u03c0(s) is the fixed point of the Bellman operator T V \u03c0(s), i.e. V \u03c0(s) = T V \u03c0(s).\nWhen the state space is too large or infinite, exact representation of the value function is often practically unfeasible. Function approximation is thus of great demand for estimating the actual value function. A popular approach is to construct a set of features by the map \u03c6 : S \u2192 Rk, which are called the features or basis functions, and then to approximate the value function by a linear function. Concretely, for a given state s, the value function is approximated by\nV (s) \u2248 (\u03c6(s))>\u03b8 =: V\u03b8, (3)\nwhere \u03b8 \u2208 Rk is a parameter vector. In the setting of TD learning, the parameter \u03b8 is updated at each time step t, i.e. for each state transition and the associated reward (st, rt, s \u2032 t). Here, we consider the simple one-step TD learning with linear function approximation, i.e. \u03bb = 0 in the framework of TD(\u03bb) learning. The parameter \u03b8 is updated as follows\n\u03b8t+1 = \u03b8t + \u03b1t\u03b4t\u03c6t, (4)\nwhere \u03b1t > 0 is a sequence of step-size parameters, and \u03b4t is the simple TD error\n\u03b4t = rt + \u03b8 > t ( \u03b3\u03c6\u2032t \u2212 \u03c6t ) . (5)\nNote, that the TD error \u03b4t can be considered as a function of the parameter \u03b8t. By abuse of notation, in the rest of the paper we also denote \u03b4\u03b8 = \u03b4(\u03b8) := r + \u03b8 > (\u03b3\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6)."}, {"heading": "2.2. Three Objective Functions for TD Learning", "text": "In order to find an optimal parameter \u03b8\u2217 via an optimization process, one has to define an appropriate objective function, which accurately measures the correctness of the current value function approximation, i.e. how far the current approximation is away from the actual TD solution. In this subsection, we recall three popular objective functions for TD learning.\nMotivated by the fact that the value function is the fixed point of the Bellman operator for a given policy, correctness of an approximation V\u03b8 can be simply measured by the TD error itself, i.e.\nJ1 : Rk \u2192 R, J1(\u03b8) := 12 \u2016V\u03b8 \u2212 T V\u03b8\u2016 2 D = 1 2 (E[\u03b4\u03b8]) 2 , (6)\nwhere D \u2208 R|S|\u00d7|S| is a diagonal matrix, whose components are some state distribution. This cost function is often referred to as the Mean Squared Bellman Error (MSBE). Ideally, the minimum of the MSBE function admits a good value function approximation. Unfortunately, it is well known that, in practice, the performance of an approximation V\u03b8 depends\nMeyer Shen Diepold\non the pre-selected feature space H := { \u03a6\u03b8|\u03b8 \u2208 Rk }\n, i.e. the span of the features \u03a6 := \u03c6(S). By introducing the projector as\n\u03a0 = \u03a6 ( \u03a6>D\u03a6 )\u22121 \u03a6>D, (7)\nthe so-called Mean Squared Projected Bellman Error (MSPBE) is ofter preferred\nJ2 : Rk \u2192 R, J2(\u03b8) := 12 \u2016V\u03b8 \u2212\u03a0T V\u03b8\u2016 2 D\n= 12E[\u03b4\u03b8\u03c6] >E[\u03c6\u03c6>]\u22121E[\u03b4\u03b8\u03c6].\n(8)\nMinimizing the MSPBE function finds a fixed point of the projected Bellman operator in the feature space H, i.e. V\u03b8 = \u03a0T V\u03b8.\nFinally, we present a less popular objective function for TD learning. Recall the TD parameter update as defined in (4). The vector E[\u03b4\u03b8\u03c6] \u2208 Rk in the second summand can be considered as an error for a given \u03b8. It is expected to be equal to zero at the TD solution. Hence, one can use the `2 norm of this vector, defined as\nJ3 : Rk \u2192 R, J3(\u03b8) = 12E[\u03b4\u03b8\u03c6] >E[\u03b4\u03b8\u03c6], (9)\nas an objective function for TD learning. The function J3 is referred to as the Norm of Expected TD Update (NEU), which is used to derive the original GTD algorithm in Sutton et al. (2008)."}, {"heading": "3.

Here, the scalar \u03b7 > 0 weighs the regularization term \u2016\u03b8\u20161, and balances the sparsity of \u03b8 against the TD objective function Ji. The iterative soft thresholding (IST) algorithm is nowadays one classic algorithm for minimizing the cost function (10). It can be interpreted as an extension of the classical gradient algorithm. Due to its high popularity, we skip the derivation of the IST algorithm, and refer to Zibulevsky and Elad (2010) and the references therein for further reading.\nGiven x \u2208 Rm and \u03bd > 0, the soft thresholding operator applied to x is defined as\n\u03a8\u03bd(x) := sgn(x) max{|x| \u2212 \u03bd, 0}\n= { x\u2212 sgn(x)\u03bd, if |x| > \u03bd, 0, otherwise,\n(11)\n`1 Regularized GTD Learning\nwhere sgn(\u00b7) and max(\u00b7) are entry-wise, and is the entry-wise multiplication. Then, minimization of the objective function (10) can be achieved via applying the soft thresholding operator iteratively. Straightforwardly, we define the IST based TD update as follows\n\u03b8t+1 = \u03a8\u03b1t\u03b7 (\u03b8t \u2212 \u03b1t\u2207Ji(\u03b8t)) , (12)\nwhere \u03b1t > 0, and \u2207Ji(\u03b8t) denotes the gradient update of Ji(\u03b8t).

Stochastic GTD-IST Algorithms", "text": "The TD-IST algorithms presented in the previous subsection are only applicable in the batch setting. In some real applications, it is certainly favorable to have them working online. Stochastic gradient descent algorithms can be developed straightforwardly to minimize the `1 regularized TD objective functions.\nNow let us consider the online setting, i.e. given a sequence of data samples \u03c61, \u03c62, . . .. In the form of stochastic gradient descent, we propose a general form of parameter update as\n\u03b8t+1 = \u03a8\u03b1t\u03b7 ( \u03b8t \u2212 \u03b1t\u2207\u0303Ji(\u03b8t) ) , (14)\nwhere \u2207\u0303Ji(\u03b8t) denotes the stochastic gradient updates of Ji(\u03b8t), or their appropriate stochastic approximations, cf. Sutton et al. (2008, 2009). To investigate convergence properties of the proposed algorithms requires results from Duchi and Singer (2009), which develops a general framework for analyzing empirical loss minimization with regularizations. We adapt the result in corollary 10 from Duchi and Singer (2009) to our current setting as follows.\nTheorem 1 Let the function J : Rk \u2192 R be smooth and strictly convex and \u03b8\u2217 \u2208 Rk be the global minimum of the function F (\u03b8) := J(\u03b8) + \u03b7\u2016\u03b8\u20161 with \u03b7 > 0. If the following three conditions hold: (1) \u03b8\u2217 fulfills \u2016\u03b8t \u2212 \u03b8\u2217\u20162 \u2264 d for some constant d > 0; (2) \u2016\u2207J(\u03b8t)\u20162 \u2264 g for some constant g > 0; and (3) a stochastic estimate of the gradient \u2207\u0303J(\u03b8t) fulfills E[\u2207\u0303J(\u03b8t)] = \u2207J(\u03b8t), then IST based stochastic algorithms converge with probability one to \u03b8\u2217.\nLet us look at the `1 regularized NEU function F3 first. Recall the approximate stochastic gradient update, developed in Sutton et al. (2008), as\n\u2207\u0303J3(\u03b8t) = (\u03c6>t ut)(\u03b3\u03c6\u2032t \u2212 \u03c6t), (15)\nwith ut+1 = ut + \u03b2t(\u03b4t\u03c6t \u2212 ut), (16)\nMeyer Shen Diepold\nwhere \u03b2t > 0 is a step size parameter. We refer to the corresponding algorithm as the GTD-IST algorithm. Convergence properties of the GTD-IST algorithm are characterized in the following corollary.\nCorollary 2 If (\u03c6t, rt, \u03c6 \u2032 t) is an i.i.d sequence with uniformly bounded second moments, and the matrix E[\u03c6(\u03b3\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6)>] \u2208 Rk\u00d7k is invertible, then the GTD-IST algorithm, whose update is specified in (15), converges with probability one to the TD solution.\nProof Recall the TD error \u03b4\u03b8 = r + \u03b8 >(\u03b3\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6). The `1 regularized NEU cost function F3 can be written as\nF3(\u03b8) = E[\u03b4\u03b8\u03c6]>E[\u03b4\u03b8\u03c6] + \u03b7\u2016\u03b8\u20161 = E [ r\u03c6+ \u03b8>(\u03b3\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6)\u03c6 ]>E[r\u03c6+ \u03b8>(\u03b3\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6)\u03c6]+ \u03b7\u2016\u03b8\u20161. (17) It is easily seen that the regularized function F3 is strictly convex if the matrix E[\u03c6(\u03b3\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6)>] is invertible. The TD solution is then the global minimum of F3. The condition of (\u03c6t, rt, \u03c6 \u2032 t) being an i.i.d sequence with uniformly bounded second moments ensures that \u2016\u2207Ji(\u03b8t)\u20162 \u2264 g holds true for some constant g > 0. Finally, applying the fact that the stochastic approximation ut is a quasi-stationary estimate of the term E[\u03b4\u03c6], cf. Sutton et al. (2008), we have\nE [ \u2207\u0303J3(\u03b8t) ] =E [ (\u03b3\u03c6\u2032t \u2212 \u03c6t)\u03c6>t ut ] =E [ (\u03b3\u03c6\u2032t \u2212 \u03c6t)\u03c6>t ] E [ \u03b4t\u03c6t\n] =\u2207J3(\u03b8t).\n(18)\nThen the result follows from Theorem 1.\nIn order to minimize the MSPBE function J2, two efficient GTD algorithms are developed in Sutton et al. (2009). Their approximate stochastic updates are defined as\n\u2207\u0303J (1)2 (\u03b8t) = (\u03c6 > t wt)(\u03b3\u03c6 \u2032 t \u2212 \u03c6t), (19a) \u2207\u0303J (2)2 (\u03b8t) = \u03b3(\u03c6 > t wt)\u03c6 \u2032 t \u2212 \u03b4t\u03c6t, (19b)\nwhere wt+1 = wt + \u03b2t(\u03b4t \u2212 \u03c6>t wt)\u03c6t. (20)\nWe refer to the corresponding `1 regularized GTD algorithms, which employ the updates (19a) and (19b), as GTD2-IST and TDC-IST algorithms, respectively. With no surprises, they share similar convergence properties as the GTD-IST algorithm.\nCorollary 3 If (\u03c6t, rt, \u03c6 \u2032 t) is an i.i.d sequence with uniformly bounded second moments, and both E[\u03c6(\u03c6\u2212 \u03b3\u03c6\u2032)>] and E[\u03c6\u03c6>] are invertible, then both the GTD2-IST and the TDC-IST algorithms, whose updates are specified in (19), converge with probability one to the TD solution.\n`1 Regularized GTD Learning\nProof The `1 regularized MSPBE cost function F2 can be written as\nF2(\u03b8) = E[\u03b4\u03b8\u03c6]>E[\u03c6\u03c6>]\u22121E[\u03b4\u03b8\u03c6] + \u03b7\u2016\u03b8\u20161 = E [ r\u03c6+ \u03b8>(\u03b3\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6)\u03c6 ]>E[\u03c6\u03c6>]\u22121E[r\u03c6+ \u03b8>(\u03b3\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6)\u03c6]+ \u03b7\u2016\u03b8\u20161. (21) The function F2 is strictly convex if the matrix\nE [ \u03c6(\u03b3\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6)> ] E[\u03c6\u03c6>]\u22121E [ (\u03b3\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6)\u03c6> ] (22)\nis positive definite, i.e. both E[\u03c6(\u03c6\u2212 \u03b3\u03c6\u2032)>] and E[\u03c6\u03c6>] are invertible.

In each of the outer states, the agent can choose between two actions: either the \u201csolid\u201d action, which takes it to the center state with probability one, or the \u201cdotted\u201d action, which takes it to any of the other states with equal probability. Reward on all state transitions is equal to zero and the states are represented by tabular features as described in the original setting. We add 20 noisy \u201cGaussian\u201d features to the state representation. The behavior policy chooses the \u201csolid\u201d action with the probability 1/7 and the \u201cdotted\u201d otherwise, while the estimation policy chooses always the \u201cdotted\u201d action. The learning curves in Figure 4 shows that both GTDIST and GTD2-IST algorithms outperform their original counterparts consistently."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusions", "text": "This work combines the recently developed GTD methods with `1 regularization, and proposes a family of GTD-IST algorithms. We investigate the convergence properties of the proposed algorithms from the perspective of stochastic optimization. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that the proposed family of GTD-IST algorithms outperform all their original counterparts and two existing `1 regularized TD algorithms. Being aware of advanced developments in the community of sparse representation, we project to employ further state-of-the-art algorithms of sparse representation to RL. For example, the IST algorithms are usually known to be slow compared to other advanced `1 minimization algorithms. Applying more efficient `1 minimization algorithms, such as Beck and Teboulle (2009), to TD learning are of great interests as the future work.\n`1 Regularized GTD Learning"}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work has been partially supported by the International Graduate School of Science and Engineering (IGSSE), Technische Universita\u0308t Mu\u0308nchen, Germany.
