INTRODUCTION\nSequence segmentation is an important task for many speech and audio applications such as speaker diarization, laboratory phonology research, speech synthesis, and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Segmentation models can be used as a pre-process step to clean the data (e.g., removing non-speech regions such as music or noise to reduce ASR error [1, 2]). They can also be used as tools in clinically- or theoreticallyfocused phonetic studies that utilize acoustic properties as a dependent measure. For example, voice onset time, a key feature distinguishing voiced and voiceless consonants across languages [3], is important both in ASR [4], clinical [5], and theoretical studies [6].\nPrevious work on speech sequence segmentation focuses on generative models such as hidden Markov models (see for example [7] and the references therein); on discriminative methods [2, 8, 9]; or on deep learning [10, 11].\nInspired by the recent work on combined deep network and structured prediction models [12, 13, 14, 15, 16], we would like to further improve performance on speech sequence segmentation and propose a new efficient joint deep\nSupported in part by NIH grant 1R21HD077140.\nnetwork and structure prediction model. Specifically, we jointly optimize RNN and structured loss parameters by using RNN outputs as feature functions for a structured prediction model. First, an RNN encodes the entire speech utterance and outputs new representation for each of the frames. Then, an efficient search is applied over all possible segments so that the most probable one can be selected. We evaluate this approach using two tasks: word segmentation and voice onset time segmentation. In both tasks the input is a speech segment and the goal is to determine the boundaries of the defined event. We show that the proposed approach outperforms previous methods on these two segmentation tasks.\n2. PROBLEM SETTING\nIn the problem of speech segmentation we are provided with a speech utterance, denoted as x\u0304 = (x1, . . . ,xT ), represented as a sequence of acoustic feature vectors, where each xt \u2208 RD (1 \u2264 t \u2264 T ) is a D-dimensional vector. The length of the speech utterance, T , is not a fixed value, since the input utterances can have different durations.\nEach input utterance is associated with a timing sequence, denoted by y\u0304 = (y1, . . . , yp), where p can vary across different inputs. Each element yi \u2208 Y , where Y = {1, . . . , T} indicates the start time of a new event in the speech signal. We annotate all the possible timing sequence of size p by Yp\nFor example, in word segmentation the goal is to segment a word from silence and noise in the signal. In this case the size of y\u0304 is 2, namely word onset and offset. However, in phoneme segmentation the goal is to segment every phoneme in a spoken word. In this case the size of y\u0304 is different for each input sequence.\nGenerally, our method is suitable for different sequence size |y\u0304|. In this paper we focused on |y\u0304|= 2, and leave the problem of |y\u0304|> 2 to future work.\n3. MODEL DESCRIPTION\nWe now describe our model in greater detail. First, we present the structured prediction framework and then discuss how it is combined with an RNN.\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n07 91\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n5 O\nct 2\n01 6"}, {"heading": "3.1. Structured Prediction", "text": "We consider the following prediction rule withw \u2208 Rd, such that y\u0304\u2032w is a good approximation to the true label of x\u0304, as follows:\n(1)y\u0304\u2032w(x\u0304) = argmax y\u0304\u2208Y w>\u03c6(x\u0304, y\u0304)\nFollowing the structured prediction framework, we assume there exists some unknown probability distribution \u03c1 over pairs (x\u0304, y\u0304) where y\u0304 is the desired output (or reference output) for input x\u0304. Both x\u0304 and y\u0304 are usually structured objects such as sequences, trees, etc. Our goal is to set w so as to minimize the expected cost, or the risk,\nw\u2217 = argmin w E(x\u0304,y\u0304)\u223c\u03c1[`(y\u0304, y\u0304\u2032w(x\u0304))]. (2)\nThis objective function is hard to minimize directly since the distribution \u03c1 is unknown. We use a training set S = {(x\u03041, y\u03041), . . . , (x\u0304m, y\u0304m)} of m examples that are drawn i.i.d. from \u03c1, and replace the expectation in (2) with a mean over the training set.\nThe cost is often a combinatorial non-convex quantity, which is hard to minimize. Hence, instead of minimizing the cost directly, we minimize a slightly different function called a surrogate loss, denoted \u00af\u0300(w, x\u0304, y\u0304), and closely related to the cost. Overall, the objective function in (2) transforms into the following objective function, denoted as F :\n(3)F (w, x\u0304, y\u0304) = 1\nm m\u2211 i=1 \u00af\u0300(w, x\u0304, y\u0304)\nIn this work the surrogate loss function is the structural hinge loss [17] defined as\n\u00af\u0300(w, x\u0304, y\u0304) = max y\u0304\u2032\u2208Y\n[ `(y\u0304, y\u0304\u2032)\u2212w>\u03c6(x\u0304, y\u0304) +w>\u03c6(x\u0304, y\u0304\u2032) ] Usually, \u03c6(x\u0304, y\u0304) is manually chosen using data analysis techniques and involves manipulation on local and global features. In the next subsection we describe how to use an RNN as feature functions."}, {"heading": "3.2. Recurrent Neural Networks as Feature Functions", "text": "RNN is a deep network architecture that can model the behavior of dynamic temporal sequences using an internal state which can be thought of as memory [18, 19]. RNN provides the ability to predict the current frame label based on the previous frames. Bidirectional RNN is a model composed of two RNNs: the first is a standard RNN while the second reads the input backwards. Such a model can predict the current frame based on both past and future frames. By using the RNN outputs we can jointly train the structured and network models.\nRecall our prediction rule in Eq. (1): notice that \u03c6(x\u0304, y\u0304) can be viewed as \u2211p i=1 \u03c6\n\u2032(x\u0304, yi) where each \u03c6 can be extracted using different techniques, e.g., hand-crafted, feedforward neural network, RNNs, etc. We can formulate the\nprediction rule as follows:\n(4)\ny\u0304\u2032w(x\u0304) = argmax y\u0304\u2208Yp w>\u03c6(x\u0304, y\u0304)\n= argmax y\u0304\u2208Yp w> p\u2211 i=1 \u03c6\u2032(x\u0304, yi)\n= argmax y\u0304\u2208Yp w> p\u2211 i=1 RNN(x\u0304, yi),\nwhere the RNN can be of any type and architecture. For example, we can use bidirectional RNN and consider \u03c6 as the concatenation of both outputs BI-RNNforward\u2295BI-RNNbackward. This is depicted in Figure 1. We call our model DeepSegmentor .\nOur goal is to find the model parameters so as to minimize the risk as in Eq. (2). Recall, we use the structural hinge loss function, and since both the loss function and the RNN are differentiable we can optimize them using gradient based methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In order to optimize the network parameters using the backpropagation algorithm [20], we must find the outer derivative of each layer with respect to the model parameters and inputs.\nThe derivative of the loss layer with respect to the layer parameters w for the training example (x\u0304, y\u0304) is\n\u2202F \u2202w = \u03c6(x\u0304, y\u0304`w)\u2212 \u03c6(x\u0304, y\u0304),\nwhere\ny\u0304`w = argmax y\u0304\u2032\u2208Yp w>\u03c6(x\u0304, y\u0304\u2032) + `(y\u0304, y\u0304\u2032). (5)\nSimilarly, the derivatives with respect to the layer\u2019s inputs are\n\u2202F \u2202\u03c6(x\u0304, y\u0304) = \u2212w \u2202F \u2202\u03c6(x\u0304, y\u0304\u2032) = w.\nThe derivatives of the rest of the layers are the same as an RNN model.\n4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nWe investigate two segmentation problems; word segmentation and voice onset time segmentation. We describe each of them in details in the following subsections.1"}, {"heading": "4.1. Word Segmentation", "text": "In the problem of word segmentation we are provided with a speech utterance which contains a single word; our goal is to predict its start and end times. The ability to determine these timings is crucial to phonetic studies that measure speaker properties (e.g. response time [23]) or as a preprocessing step for other phonetic analysis tools [11, 10, 9, 8, 24]."}, {"heading": "4.1.1.

The NLL model makes a binary decision in every frame to predict whether there is voice activity or not.

To account for this, we apply a smoothing algorithm and find the most probable pair of timings.\nWe trained the DeepSegmentor model using the structured loss function as in (6), denoted as Combined Duration (CD) loss. The motivation for using this function is due to disparities in the manual annotations, which are common and depend both on human errors and objective difficulties in placing the\n1All models were implemented using Torch7 toolkit [21, 22]\nboundaries.

We extracted the 13 Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCCs), without the deltas, every 10 ms, and use them as inputs to the network. We optimize the networks using AdaGrad [26]. All parameters were tuned on a dedicated development set for both of the models. As for the NLL models, we trained 4 different models; LSTM with one and two layers, and bidirectional LSTM with one and two layers, denoted as RNN, 2RNN, BI-RNN and BI-2-RNN, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the results for both models.\nBesides being efficient and more elegant, DeepSegmentor is superior to the NLL models when measuring (6), with the exception of BI-2-RNN, which was slightly better for the offset measurement."}, {"heading": "4.2. VOT Segmentation", "text": "Voice onset time (VOT) is the time between the onset of a stop burst and the onset of voicing. As noted in the introduction, it is widely used in theoretical and clinical studies as well as ASR tasks. In this problem the input is a speech utterance containing a single stop consonant, and the output is the VOT onset and offset times.\nWe compared our model to two other methods for VOT measurement. First is the AutoVOT algorithm [9]. This algorithm follows the structured prediction approach of linear classifier with hand-crafted features and feature-functions. The second algorithm is the DeepVOT algorithm [11]. This algorithm uses RNNs with NLL as loss function. Hence, it predicts for each frame whether it is related to the VOT or not. Using the RNN predictions, a dynamic programming algorithm is applied to find the best onset and offset times. Our approach combines both of these methods while jointly training RNN with structured loss function."}, {"heading": "4.2.1. Datasets", "text": "We use two different datasets. The first one, PGWORDS, is from a laboratory study by Paterson and Goldrick [6]. American English monolinguals and Brazilian Portuguese (L1)-English bilinguals (24 participants each) named a set of 144 pictures. Productions other than the intended label as well as those with code-switching or disfluencies were excluded. VOT of remaining words was annotated by one transcriber.\nThe second dataset, BB, consists of spontaneous speech from the 2008 season of Big Brother UK, a British reality television show [27, 9]. The speech comes from 4 speakers recorded in the \u201cdiary room,\u201d an acoustically clean environment. VOTs were manually measured by two transcribers.\n4.2.2. Results \u2014 PGWORDS\nFor the PGWORDS dataset we use two layers of bidirectional LSTMs with dropout after each recurrent layer. We use (6) as our loss function. The input features are the same as in [9, 11]; overall we have 63 features per frame. We optimize the networks using AdaGrad optimization. All parameters were tuned on a dedicated development set. Table 2 summarizes the results using the same loss function as in [9]. Results suggests that DeepSegmentor outperforms the AutoVOT model over all tolerance values. However, when comparing to DeepVOT, the picture is mixed. In the lower tolerance values DeepSegmentor is superior to the DeepVOT while for higher values DeepVOT performs better. We believe these results are due to the DeepVOT being less delicate and solving a much coarser problem than the DeepSegmentor ; hence, it performs better when considering high tolerance values. We believe the integration between these two systems, (using DeepVOT as pre-training for the DeepSegmentor ), will yield more accurate and robust results. We leave this investigation for future work."}, {"heading": "4.2.3. Results \u2014 BB", "text": "For the BB dataset we use two layers of LSTMs with dropout after each recurrent layer.

Table 3 summarize the results using the loss function as in [9]. It is worth notice that we see the same behavior on this dataset as well, regarding the DeepVOT preforms better then the DeepSegmentor in hight tolerance values.\nFuture work will explore timing sequence of length greater than 2 - for instance, in phoneme segmentation, where the sequence varies across training examples. The model\u2019s robustness to noise and length as well as its ability to generalize are also key areas of future development. We would therefore like to explore training the model in two stages: first as a multi-class version and then fine-tuning using structured loss. With respect to machine learning, future directions include the effect of network size, depth, and loss function on model performance.\nIn this paper we present a new algorithm for speech segmentation and evaluate its performance to two different tasks. The proposed algorithm combines structured loss function with recurrent neural networks and outperforms current stateof- the-art methods.\n6.
