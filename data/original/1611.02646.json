Most of the difficulties in the application of closed itemsets to practical datasets are caused by the exponential number of formal concepts. It complicates both the process of the model construction and the analysis of the results as well. Recently, several approaches to tackle these issues were introduced. All of the closed itemsets computed on a dataset and ordered by inclusion relation make a lattice, below we use the terminology of concept lattices and Formal Concept Analysis [4]. In terms of FCA, a concept is a pair consisting of an extent (a closed set of transactions) and an intent (the respective closed itemset).\nWe propose to divide existed approaches to simplifying concept mining into the groups represented on Figure 1. Methods of the first group provide a complete lattice built on modified data. The most general way to get smaller lattices is to reduce the size of datasets preserving the most important information. For this purpose such methods as Singular Value Decomposition [5], Non-negative Matrix Decomposition [6] and more computationally effective k-Means [7], fuzzy k-Means [8], agglomerative clustering of objects based on a similarity function of weighted attributes [9] are used. Another way to reduce the lattice size was proposed in [10]. This approach aims at the reduction in the number of incomparable concepts by making slight changes of the context.\nThe second class of methods to simplify the analysis of a lattice is computing a fragment of the original lattice. It can be done by defining an antimonotonic function w.r.t. the algorithm that computes concepts. Computing concepts with extents exceeding a threshold was proposed in [11] and studied in relation to frequent itemset mining in [12]. Authors propose an algorithm for building iceberg lattices. In this case some interesting rare concepts may be omitted, thus, it yields fewer results. From this perspective, the most promising approach is applying \u2206-stability. \u03a3o\u03d5\u03b9\u03b1 algorithm (Sofia) for computing a lattice fragment was proposed in [13]. \u2206-stability will be considered in Section 3.\n\u2217This is an updated and extended version of the conference paper \u201cConcept interestingness measures: a comparative study\u201d, CLA - 2015\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n02 64\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n8 N\nov 2\n01 6\nThe most well-reasoned way to build a lattice fragment is to modify the closure operator and to restrict the creation of new concepts by involving background knowledge. In [14] attribute-dependency formulas (AD-formulas) were introduced. Authors define mandatory attributes for particular attributes of a context. If an attribute is included in a closed itemset without its mandatory attributes the concepts will not be created. In [15] an analogous approach based on attribute weights was proposed. The interestingness of concepts is estimated using an aggregation function (average, maximum or minimum), which is applied to a generator, a minimal generator or to an intent. Authors also note correspondence between the numerical approach and AD-formulas.\nSome restricted closure operators naturally arise from analyzed data and subject area. Carpineto and Romano [2] considered the document-term relation, where documents corresponded to objects and terms from each document were set as their attributes. Authors proposed to modify the closure operator using a hierarchy of terms as follows: two different attributes are regarded as equivalent if they have a common ancestor, which is a more general term.\nIn the last decade some polynomial-time algorithms for computing Galois sub-hierarchies were proposed, see [16, 17].\nThe main idea of methods from the last group is to assess interestingness of concepts by applying indices to them. This approach does not have disadvantages of the previously described methods, namely, getting concepts approximately corresponding to original objects or attributes, missing interesting concepts due to early stopping of an algorithm, a costly preprocessing procedure requiring the involvement of domain experts or another reliable source of background knowledge. This class, however, has its own drawbacks, for example, the exponential complexity of the lattice computation is compounded by the complexity of the index computation. The most promising approach from this point of view is to compute a subset of concepts using antimonotonic indices.\nThe rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly introduces the main notions of Formal Concept Analysis. In Section 3 we consider existed indices for concepts. Section 4 focuses on a comparative study of the described in the previous section indices in the context of the most important tasks: noise reduction and selection of interesting concepts. In Section 5 we provide a guideline for the development of new indices based on arbitrary itemset indices. In Section 6 we conclude and give the direction of future work."}, {"heading": "2 Formal Concept Analysis: Basic Definitions", "text": "Here we briefly recall the main notions of FCA [4].

For example, it provides an exhaustive study of a complete lattice, which is computed only once, ensures easily interpretable results by preserving objects and attributes corresponding exactly to the original data. The exponential time complexity of lattice computing accompanied by the growing size of analyzing data attaches particular importance to antimonotonic indices, since they allow creating only a subset of formal concepts.\nIn this section we study existed indices proposed for closed itemsets using the apparatus of FCA theory. We describe the most important index attributes and use them to build a concept lattice. Below, key characteristics of indices are described."}, {"heading": "3.1 Description of Index Characteristics", "text": "Some of the indices originally designed to assess concepts (\u201cdesigned for closed itemsets\u201d) can not be applied to arbitrary itemsets (\u201cnot applicable to arbitrary itemsets\u201d), whereas others were originally designed as arbitrary itemset metrics. In our study we consider only two arbitrary itemset indices, viz. support/frequency, due to their importance in concept mining.\nThere exist indices which deal with each attribute of an intent (or a whole context) separately and assess the contribution of these components to a concept (\u201cusing all of the single attributes of a context\u201d). Another essential feature of the concept indices is the use of other concepts (\u201cbased on comparison to other attribute sets (intents)\u201d). The concepts are selected based on a particular condition or index values, i.e., frequent, (dis)similar to some other concepts, etc. In this case an index is comprised of relative values or differences between absolute values of the selected concepts and the assessed concept. We additionally add only one predicate \u201cis neighbor\u201d (\u201cbased on comparison to neighboring attribute sets\u201d), since the direct neighbors of a concept are highly important both for computing closed itemsets and for concept mining.\nAs it was noted previously, support has a special place in concept mining. We define \u201csupport-based (for sets of attributes)\u201d and \u201csupport-based (for single attributes)\u201d features to characterize whether an index is based on support. Support may be regarded as probability of an attribute or a set of attributes, along with it we also consider conditional probability (\u201cusing conditional (joint) probability\u201d). \u201cSize-based\u201d indices use the size of an intent or an extent, the total number of attributes or objects, thus, they do not require to assess to particular elements of a context.\na1: (designed) for closed itemsets, a2: not applicable to arbitrary itemsets, ;a3: applicable to arbitrary itemsets, a4: using all of the single attributes of a context, a5: based on comparison to other attribute sets, a6: based on comparison to neighboring attribute sets, a7: support-based (for sets of attributes), a8: support-based (for single attributes), a9: size-based, a10: using conditional (joint) probability, a11: monotonic-antimonotonic w.r.t. order on attribute sets, a12: using a tuning parameter, a13: boolean value, a14: polynomial complexity, a15: sublinear complexity, a16: linear complexity, a17: quadratic complexity, a18: cubic and higher complexity, a19: computable in one-pass over data\nAs it was mentioned before, the antimonotonicity is one of the most important index properties, since it allows us to rectify the problem of the exponential complexity of algorithms for deriving concepts. The time complexity is referred through the following attributes: \u201cpolynomial complexity\u201d, \u201csublinear complexity\u201d, \u201clinear complexity\u201d, \u201cquadratic complexity\u201d, \u201ccubic and higher complexity\u201d. These groups are defined w.r.t. the size of a context, i.e., |G||M | under the assumption that the lattice has been computed. The possibility to compute indices in \u201cone-pass over data\u201d is relevant to complexity problem, but mostly it refers to the memory complexity and analysis of streaming data.\nSome indices have a tuning parameter (\u201cusing a tuning parameter\u201d) that either changes the concept rankings or is used as a binarization threshold (\u201cboolean value\u201d)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Description of Indices", "text": "In our study we use the indices described below."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Stability", "text": "Stability indices for formal concepts were introduced in [18, 19] and modified in [20].

The pairwise similarity of indices is measured by the Kendall tau correlation coefficient [42], this coefficient takes into account not only an absolute rank, but also a relative position.\nWe randomly generated 4 groups of formal concepts with the following densities (the rate of the \u201c1\u201d in the context): 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4. Each group consisted of 100 formal contexts with the number of attributes ranged between 10 and 50, and the number of objects varied from 40 to 80.\nVariance of within-group pairwise correlation is quite small (not more then 0.05) and does not depend on the context density (p-values of Levene\u2019s test is less than 0.05). Since the studied values cannot be assumed to be normally distributed (based on D\u2019Agostino and Pearson\u2019s test), the Wilcoxon\u2019s test was used to compare mean values of the Kendall tau coefficient.\nThe averaged values of the pairwise Kendall tau coefficients are represented on Figure 2. Among investigated indices several groups of correlated metrics are stood out, but only few values of pairwise correlation are statistically stable (have the same average value w.r.t. context densities).\nOne of the groups of correlated indices corresponds to approximate robustness with different values of parameters. It allows us to conclude that relative importance of concepts is mostly preserving regardless of \u03b1. Another class of indices that utilizes similarity and predictability approaches (Basic Level Metrics group) yields the second group. It should be noted, the highly correlated indices of this group are the metrics based on similarity approach with the same cohesion function and with different aggregation functions for sub/superordinate concepts. The conclusion agrees with the results presented in [34].\nOther groups of correlated indices include frequency, stability and its estimates, robustness (the exact index) and some metrics of the Basic Level approach (Cue Validity \u2013 CV, Category Feature Collocation \u2013 CFC, Category Utility \u2013 CU). Stability (robustness) is the most complex index for calculation, hence it is important to identify more easily computable indices and use them instead. In our experiments we found the following correlated indices: logarithmic estimates of stability (stabll, stablh) and Max-distinguished-extents upper bound (stab2OE)."}, {"heading": "4.2 Integral Stability Indices: Best Approximation of Stability", "text": "Integral stability index as a component of stability can be used to get estimates of stability. Here, we consider the problem of stability approximation with respect to different levels of integral stability index. Since the extent size of concepts varies in the range from 0 to |G|, for each concept we took the level of stability depending on the size of set A, to be precise, the level is defined by formula [rate \u2217 |A|], where 0 < rate < 1.\nTo find the best rate we used randomly generated formal contexts (described in the\nprevious subsection) of different densities: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and used the simple linear regression. The integral stability index of the jth level was taken as a regressor and the stability index as a dependent variable.\nScatter plots of the studied indices are given in Figure 3. As can be seen from the diagrams, taking too small rates does not allow us to estimate stability, since for most concepts small subsets Y \u2282 A, such that Y \u2032 = B do not exist.\nThe first local maximum of the coefficients of determination for model\nstability = A \u2217 stability\u03a3ratio +B\ncorresponds to rate = 0.4 (0.78 and 0.79 for context densities 0.2 and 0.3 respectively). Thus, this value can be used as the most suitable value for computing estimates of stability by integral stability index."}, {"heading": "4.3 Noise Filtering", "text": "In practice one usually faces with noisy data. Even a small noise rate can result in exponential explosion of the number of formal concepts [29]. In this connection, we study the ability of indices to select original concepts from the set of concepts computed on a noisy context. We took 5 formal concepts, the lattices of the first four of them have quite simple structure (see Figure 4) and the last one is a fragment of Mushroom dataset 1 consisted of 500 objects and 14 attributes.\n1https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom\nWe added different amount of noise into the contexts as follows: each entry changes with given probability (noise rate). For \u201cnoisy\u201d lattices we identified original concepts and considered a binary classification problem. We computed the AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve) from each index separately. The averaged AUCs within groups corresponding the same datasets with different noise rates and within groups with the same noise rate for the described above contexts are given in Figure 5.\nAs can be seen from Figure 5, the index quality mostly depends on lattice structure rather then noise rate. Cue Validity (CV), Category Feature Collocation (CFC), Category Utility (CU) and separation have the highest AUC on particular datasets, but the quality considerably changes depending on the lattice structure. For instance, AUC of CFC varies from 0.67 to 0.95. The most stable results correspond to robustness with \u03b1 \u2208 {0.3, 0.5, 0.8}, the estimates of stability are able to distinguish most of the original concepts (the AUC is greater then 0.7).\nAlmost all indices are stable with respect to different noise rates. The poor data quality has the strong impact on the estimates of stability: the quality of these indices drops down as the noise rate increases. Since these metrics are based on the elements of a lattice, the more noise is introduced, the more noisy concepts are involved in calculations. The quality of similarity-based indices (Basic Level group) is close to random guessing that makes them inapplicable to the analysis of noisy data.\nThe experiments allow us to conclude that the CV, CU, CFC, separations, robustness, margin closeness and probability are the most suitable for the analysis of noisy data."}, {"heading": "5 Generic approach to the assessment of closed itemsets", "text": "The problem of the arbitrary itemset assessment was thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature. Furthermore, some indices were proposed to assess associative rules - a part of\nFCA. A list of formulas is given in Table 2 to make the paper self-contained. More detailed information about the listed indices can be found in [43, 44, 45]. Also note that indices for association rules can be easily adapted to concept assessment by selecting another concepts and applying the index to pairs \u201ca selected concept, an assessed concept\u201d.\nIn this section we propose guidance on applying arbitrary itemset indices to closed item-\nsets. The starting point is the personal perspective on concept interestingness. We define the following ones:\n1. Some \u201cinternal\u201d/\u201cexternal\u201d properties of the concept itself. In this case homogeneous components are considered.\n2. Impact of the element gathering. Here, a metric is applied to a set and its elements: f(set) and {f(element)|element \u2208 set}.\n3. Impact of a condition: f(parameter|condition) and f(parameter).\n4. Concept pureness. This approach is based on the comparison of characteristic computed on a concept and out of the concept: f(parameter) and f(U \\ parameter)), where U is the domain of the parameter.\n5. Stability to random changes in data. Resampling strategy is applied to a set: {resampling\u03b1(set)}, where \u03b1 is a noise rate.\nThe application of one of the strategies listed above results in the set of homogeneous elements or the set of homogeneous elements with one distinguished element. In the first case an aggregation function is applied to peer elements. In the second case a comparison function can be applied to obtain peer elements: aggregateel\u2208S(compare(el, d)) or compare(aggregateel\u2208S(el), d), where S is a set of peer elements, S is a distinguished element.\nIt is worth noting that both real-valued and fuzzy functions can be used to aggregate metric values. If the values are in the interval [0, 1] (i.e., they could be considered as probabilistic components), a fuzzy aggregation function should be applied. The binary operators (t-norm or its dualization s-norm related the equation t(v1, v2) = 1\u2212 s(1\u2212 v1, 1\u2212 v2)) are represented in Table 3. In the case of the poor data quality a robust aggregation\nfunction, as median, can be applied to data. A comparison function can take one of the following forms: \u2217 \u2212 \u2217, \u2217/\u2217, log(\u2217/\u2217)."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we considered various approaches to mining interesting formal concepts (closed itemsets and respective transactions). We investigated existing indices for the concept selection and proposed a general scheme for the adaptation of an arbitrary index to concept assessment.\nThe results of our experiments allow us to distinguish groups of correlated indices and identify those of them that can be used for the analysis of noisy data. It was shown that the noise filtering quality of indices depends mostly on the structure of the concept lattice than on the noise rate. The strongest dependence of the filtering quality on noise rate corresponds to the estimates of stability. Even a small proportion of noise added to data can significantly change the lattice structure, which results in biased values of neighbor-based indices.\nWe also proposed a general method for selecting and designing interestingness indices based on index features needed in a particular application.
