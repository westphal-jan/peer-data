Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have drawn particular interest for this problem, typically in the form of an encoder-decoder architecture. One network ingests an incoming message (a Tweet, a chat message, etc.), and a second network generates an outgoing response, conditional on the first network\u2019s final hidden state. This sort of approach has been shown to improve significantly over both a statistical machine translation baseline [9] and traditional rule-based chatbots [11].\nHowever, evaluating dialogue models remains a significant challenge. While perplexity is a good measure of how well a model fits some data, it does not measure performance at a particular task. Ngram-based measures such as BLEU, while useful in translation, are a poor fit for dialogue models because two replies may have no n-gram overlap but equally good responses to a given message. Human evaluation may be ideal, but does not scale well, and can also be problematic in applications like Smart Reply [3], where data cannot be viewed by humans.\nThis work investigates the use of an adversarial evaluation method for dialogue models. Inspired by the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image generation ([2], and others), we propose that one measure of a model\u2019s quality is how easily its output is distinguished from a human\u2019s output. As an initial exploration, we take a fully trained production-scale conversation model deployed as part of the Smart Reply system (the \"generator\"), and, keeping it fixed, we train a second RNN (the \"discriminator\") on the following task: given an incoming message and a response, it must predict whether the response was sampled from the generator or a human. Our goal here is to understand whether an adversarial setup is viable either for evaluation.\nWe find that a discriminator can in fact distinguish the model output from human output over 60% of the time. Furthermore, it seems to uncover the major weaknesses that humans have observed in the system: an incorrect length distribution and a reliance on familiar, simplistic replies such as \"Thank you\". Still, significant problems with the practical application of this method remain. We lack evidence that a model with lower discriminator accuracy (i.e., that fools it) necessarily would be better in human evaluation as well.\nWorkshop on Adversarial Training, NIPS 2016, Barcelona, Spain.\nWe present here the details of our analysis, as well as further discussion of both merits and drawbacks of an adversarial setup. We conclude that additional investigation is warranted, and lay out several suggestions for that work."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related work", "text": "Much recent work has employed RNN encoder-decoder models to translate from utterance to response ([9], [8], [11]). Work in [5] has used policy gradient but the rewards are manually defined as useful conversational properties such as non-redundancy. Evaluation remains a significant challenge [6].\nThe adversarial setup we describe is inspired by work on GANs for image generation [2]; however, we apply the concept to dialogue modeling, which raises the challenges of sequential inputs/outputs and conditional generation. To support our aim of understanding the discriminator, we also do not train the generator and discriminator jointly.\nAn adversarial loss for language understanding is also used in [1] as a means of evaluation; however, the metric is not applied to any real world task, nor are the properties of the discriminator itself explored and evaluated, as we will do in this work."}, {"heading": "2 Model", "text": "Like a GAN, our architecture consists of a generator and a discriminator; however, these are two separate models which are not trained to a single objective.\nThe generator is a sequence-to-sequence model, consisting of an RNN encoder and an RNN decoder. Given a corpus of message pairs (o, r) where o, the original message, consists of tokens {o1, ..., on} and r, the response message, consists of tokens {r1, ..., rm}, this model is trained to maximize the total log probability of observed response messages, given their respective original messages:\n\u2211\n(o,r)\nlogP (r1, ..., rm|o1, ..., on)\nThe discriminator is also an RNN, but has only an encoder followed by a binary classifier. Given a corpus of message pairs and scores (o, r, y) , where y = 1 if r was sampled from the training data and 0 otherwise, this model is trained to maximize:\n\u2211\n(o,r,y)\nlogP (y|o1, ..., on, r1, ..., rm)"}, {"heading": "3 Experiments", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Data and training", "text": "We investigate the proposed adversarial loss using a corpus of email reply pairs (o, r). The generator is trained on the same data and in the same manner as the production-scale model that is deployed as part of the Smart Reply feature in Inbox by Gmail [3]. 1\nThe discriminator is then trained on a held out set of the email corpus. For half the pairs (o, r) in the held out set, we leave the example unchanged and assign a 1. For the other half we replace r with a message r\u2032 that has been sampled from the generator, and assign the pair (o, r\u2032) a score of 0. Then the discriminator is trained as described in the previous section."}, {"heading": "3.2 Discriminator performance", "text": "We observe that the discriminator can distinguish between generator samples and human samples, conditional on an original message, 62.5% of the time. This in itself may be somewhat unexepcted:\n1In particular, from [3]: \"All email data (raw data, preprocessed data and training data) was encrypted. Engineers could only inspect aggregated statistics on anonymized sentences that occurred across many users and did not identify any user.\"\none may expect that since the discriminator is only as powerful as the generator, it would not be able to distinguish its distribution from the training distribution. A full precision-recall curve is shown in Figure 1."}, {"heading": "3.3 Comparison with perplexity", "text": "A qualitative analysis shows that the discriminator objective favors different features than the generator objective. To demonstrate this, we sample 100 responses from the generator for each of 100 donated email messages. These are then ranked according to both the discriminator score and the generator\u2019s assigned log likelihood, and the two rankings are compared.\nFirst, we see that the discriminator\u2019s preferences are strongly correlated with length (Figure 1). This is relevant because it has been previously documented that sequence-to-sequence models have a length bias [10]. The discriminator relies too heavily on this signal, favoring longer responses even when they are not internally coherent. Still, it is noteworthy that it identifies something humans have documented as a key weakness of the model [11].\nThe discriminator does not assign equal probability to all responses of the same length. When comparing responses of the same length, we find that it has a significantly different ranking than the likelihood assigned by the generator, with an average Spearman\u2019s correlation of -0.02. Broadly speaking we find that the discriminator has less preference for the most common responses produced by the generator, things like \"Thank you!\" and \"Yes!\" (Table 1). The lack of diverse generated language has been documented as a weakness of these dialogue models in [3] and [4], both of which incorporate significant post-processing and re-ranking to overcome this noted weakness. As with length, the discriminator\u2019s preference for rarer language does not necessarily mean it is favoring better responses; it is noteworthy only in that it shows signs of detecting the known weakness of the generator. Future work might incorporate minibatch discrimination [7] to more explicitly address the diversity weakness."}, {"heading": "4 Discussion", "text": "In this research note we investigated whether the discriminator in GANs can be employed for automatic evaluation of dialogue systems. We see a natural progression towards using discriminators:\n1. Ask humans to evaluate each single system published in a consistent manner. Though ideal, it would also be time consuming and prohibitively expensive.\n2. Annotate a large dataset of dialogues, learn a \u201ccritic\u201d (e.g., a neural network), and use it to score any new system (so that extra human labour would not be required). However, this critic would likely not perform well when evaluated off-policy, and overfitting could occur, as researchers may naturally find its weaknesses.\n3. Use the discriminator of a GAN as a proxy for giving feedback akin to a human. Since training such a critic would be simple for any dialogue system, each research group could provide theirs and any new system could be evaluated with a variety of discriminators.\nThe last item is the simplest, and it is what we have explored in this work. Our preliminary work suggests that the critic we trained on a production-quality dialogue system is able to automatically find some of the previously identified weaknesses when employing probabilistic models \u2013 sequence length and diversity. It also succeeds in identifying real vs generated responses of a highly tuned system.\nHowever, as with GANs, more needs to be understood and using discriminators alone won\u2019t solve the evaluation challenges of dialogue systems. Despite the fact that GANs do not use any extra information than what\u2019s already present in the training dataset, some have argued that it is a better loss than likelihood [12]. Still, there remains a tension between what we train the discriminator on (samples) and what we typically use in practice (the maximally likely response, or some approximation of it). Discriminators have a harder time when sampling versus using beam search, but this conflicts with human observations that some amount of search typically is useful to get the highest quality responses. Further work is required to understand if and how discriminators can be applied in this domain."}], "references": [{"title": "Generating sentences from a continuous space", "author": ["S.R.
