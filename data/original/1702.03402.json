INTRODUCTION", "text": "Recently, automatic sequence classification became an ubiquitous problem, having then encountered a high research interest [1, 2, 3]. This is due to the need to structure knowledge as a set of dependent localized information alongside with the new computer capabilities to efficiently process large amount of data. Among the recent methods employed to structure these sequences, the machine learning domain provides a set of high-level representations well adapted to automatic sequence classification based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) [4] or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) [5].\nRNN architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [6] and Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) [7] have\ngained a particular attention in different domains and tasks including sentence [8] or successive images [9] processing. In speech recognition [10, 11, 12], these LSTM models exploit the contextual information whenever speech production or perception is influenced by emotion, strong accents, or background noise. The most effective use of RNNs for sequence classification is to combine the RNNs with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in a hybrid approach [13, 14]. Nonetheless, RNNs or RNN-HMM could not be directly employed for sequence classification using multiple inputs from synchronous streams such as TV shows coming from different channels. Indeed, RNNs can only be trained to make a set of elements labeled in a single stream of input information.\nIn this paper, we introduce an original multistream neural network architecture, called Parallel LSTM (PLSTM), that simultaneously takes into account different synchronous streams in order to automatically classify this multistream sequence. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed PLSTM multistream neural network architecture, experiments are carried out on the LIA\u2019s Electronic ProgramGuide (EPG) dataset containing 3 years of TV programs from 4 different channels. The PLSTM performance is compared with the LSTM stateof-the-art approach as well as a classic n-gram approach considered as the baseline. Our PLSTM approach is an important step for sequence classification since it can be applied to any set of synchronous sequences.\nSection 2 proposes an overview of a couple of RNN architectures. Section 3 presents the proposed PLSTM. The experimental protocol and the discussion on the results are presented in Section 4 and 5 respectively. Finally, Section 6 concludes this work and gives some interesting perspectives."}, {"heading": "2. RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS", "text": "This section introduces the state-of-the art concepts of two recurrent neural networks: LSTM and BLSTM."}, {"heading": "2.1. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)", "text": "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [6] networks are a special case of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [5]. The goal of this architecture is to create an internal cell state of the\nnetwork which allows it to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior. This internal state allows the RNN to process arbitrary sequences of inputs such as sequences of words [8] for language modeling, time series [1]. . . The RNN takes as input a sequence x = (x1, x2, . . . , xT ) and computes the hidden sequence h = (h1, h2, . . . , hT ) as well as the output vector y = (y1, y2, . . . , yT ) by iterating from t = 1 to T :\nht = H(Wxhxt + Whhht\u22121 + bh) (1)\nyt = Whyht + by (2)\nwhere T is the total number of sequences; Wxh are the weight matrices between the input layers x and h and so on; b is a bias vector, and H is the composite function. [6] shows that LSTM networks outperformRNNs for finding long range context and dependencies. The LSTM composite functionH forming the LSTM cell with peephole connections [15] is presented in Figure 1 and defined as:\nit = \u03c3(Wxixt + Whiht\u22121 + Wcict\u22121 + bi) (3)\nft = \u03c3(Wxfxt + Whfht\u22121 + Wcfct\u22121 + bf ) (4)\nct = ftct\u22121 + it tanh(Wxcxt + Whcht\u22121 + bc) (5)\not = \u03c3(Wxoxt + Whoht\u22121 + Wcoct + bo) (6)\nht = ot tanh(ct) (7)\nwhere i, f and o, are respectively the input, forget and output gates, and c the cell activation vector with the same size than the hidden vector h. The weight matrices W from cell c to gates i, f and o, are diagonal, and thus, an element e in each gate vector receives only the element e from the cell vector. Finally, \u03c3 is the logistic sigmoid function."}, {"heading": "2.2. Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM)", "text": "LSTM networks use only the previous context to predict the next segment for a given sequence. Bidirectional RNN (BRNN) [16], presented in Figure 2, can process both directions with two separate hidden layers (one for each direction). This type of RNN feeds to a same output layer fed forwarded\ninputs through the two hidden layers. Therefore, the BRNN computes both forward hidden sequence \u2212\u2192 h and backward sequence \u2190\u2212 h as well as the output vector y, by iterating \u2212\u2192 h from t = 1 to T , and \u2190\u2212 h from t = T to 1:\n\u2212\u2192 h t = H(Wx\u2212\u2192h xt + W\u2212\u2192h\u2212\u2192h \u2212\u2192 h t\u22121 + b\u2212\u2192h ) (8) \u2190\u2212 h t = H(Wx\u2190\u2212h xt + W\u2190\u2212h\u2190\u2212h \u2190\u2212 h t+1 + b\u2190\u2212h ) (9)\nyt = W\u2212\u2192h y \u2212\u2192 h t + W\u2190\u2212h y \u2190\u2212 h t + by (10)\nBy replacing the BRNN cells with LSTM cells, the Bidirectionnal LSTM (BLSTM) [7] is obtained. The BLSTM allows to exhibit long range context dependencies and takes advantage from the two directions structure. The output vector y is processed by evaluating simultaneously the two directions hidden sequences by computing the composite functionH in the forward ( \u2212\u2192 h ) and backward ( \u2190\u2212 h ) directions."}, {"heading": "3. PARALLEL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (PLSTM)", "text": "The BRNN neural architecture uses the same sequence x as an input for both forward and backward directions, which is useful for information from a single stream. The paper proposes an original neural network, called Parallel RNN (PRNN) and presented in Figure 3, that takes advantage from the BRNN structure in a multistream context. By replacing the PRNN cells with LSTM cells, the proposed Parallel LSTM (PLSTM) is obtained.\nThe original PLSTM architecture corresponds to the PRNN description by replacing the H function with the LSTM composite function. PLSTM differs from the classical BLSTM by feeding forward, not a shared sequence, but different input vectors through a dedicated hidden layer hn for each input vector xn. Moreover, BLSTM employs only 2 hidden layers due to its bidirectional concept while PLSTM can use multiple ones. The input sequences are considered independent and require to be mapped in homogeneous separate subspaces (W matrix from input x to hidden h spaces). Therefore, a single LSTM containing concatenated inputs from different independent sequences is not theoretically suitable for finding out a common homogeneous subspace to map heterogeneous input representation of parallel sequences.\nThus, for each nth stream (1 \u2264 n \u2264 N ), the PLSTM takes the input sequence xn = (xn1 , x n 2 , . . . , x N T ) and computes the hidden sequence hn = (hn1 , h n 2 , . . . , h N T ) and the output vector y by iterating from t = 1 to T .\nhNt = H(WxNhNx N t + WhNhNh N t\u22121 + b N h ) (11)\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

In our experiments, the output vector y takes advantage of the N channels to predict the telecast\u2019s genre for one given channeln (1 \u2264 n \u2264 N ). Therefore, PLSTM feeds forward separate sequences in order to predict a label and codes internal hidden structures between the parallel hidden sequences. [7] introduces the BLSTM with Back Propagation Trough Time (BPTT) algorithm [17] for training. For our proposed PLSTM architecture, the training takes place overN input sequences: Forward Pass: feeds all input data for the sequences into the PLSTM and determines the predicted outputs.\n\u2022 Do forward pass for the forward states of each of theN\nlayers.\n\u2022 Do forward pass for output layer.\nBackward Pass: processes the error function derivative for the sequences used in the forward pass.\n\u2022 Do backward pass for output neurons.\n\u2022 Do backward pass for forward states.\nUpdating Weights"}, {"heading": "4.

Data from 2013 and 2014 are merged and split into the training (70%) and validation (30%) datasets using a stratified shuffle split [18] in order to preserve the same percentage of samples of each class in the output of both folds, while the 2015 dataset is kept for testing. In order to guarantee a clean experimental environment, labels (i.e. genres) that are absent at least in one of the three folds were removed. Doing so allows us to have equivalent datasets in terms of labels vocabulary. Table 1 shows the genres distribution for M6, the chosen output channel."}, {"heading": "4.2.

Mono-channel input: only M6 history sequences for a baseline n-gram experiment (with a statistical language model from the SRILM toolkit [19]) and a straightforward LSTM model. Bi-channel input: both M6 and TF1 channel histories are employed as input for P2LSTM (PLSTM with two parallel streams as a BLSTMwith forward-forward directions and separate inputs). The aim of this experiment is to move up the context\u2019s information using a similar and rival channel, the two being generalist channels. Multichannel input: History of each of the 4 streams (i.e. channels) is used as input for 4n-gram and P4LSTM experiments (PLSTM with 4 parallel streams)."}, {"heading": "4.3.

The Keras library [20], based on Theano [21] for fast tensor manipulation and CUDAbased GPU acceleration, has been employed to train neural networks on an Nvidia GeForce GTX TITAN X GPU card. The training times, detailed in Table 2 for all models, match with the sequence size of all models. Indeed, even with the most time-consuming configuration, namely P4LSTM with 4 elements history, the training does not last more than 25 minutes."}, {"heading": "5.

The observed results confirm the interest of using multiple streams to predict the next telecast\u2019s genre for a specified channel."}, {"heading": "5.2. LSTM and PLSTM", "text": "One can figure out from Table 3 that mono-channel LSTM performances gradually become closer and closer to the multichannel n-gram model ones when the size of sequences moves up and overtakes it with an F1 score of 58% using 4 sized sequences. Therefore, LSTM-based models require longer sequences to learn long term dependencies than the ngram based methods. P4LSTM obtains the best result with an F1 score close of 66% using a sequence of size 4. In order to analyze these results, the Error Rates (ER) are also presented in Table 4. The overall F1 scores are different from those related to the ER. For example, at its best configuration of a 4 sized sequence, P4LSTM error rate reaches about 21.5%, which corresponds to a correct rate of 78.5% against an F1measure of only 66%. The reason of this is that the F1-metric may be not suitable for the task due to the labels imbalance with different numbers of genre occurrences varying from 14 to 1,683 in the test set."}, {"heading": "5.3. Discussion", "text": "Confusion matrices of 4n-gram and P4LSTM experiments using sequences of 4 telecasts are shown in Tables 5 and 6 to point out benefits of the proposed PLSTM model.\nIt is worth emphasizing that most of the missed instances in all systems are wrongly labeled as one of the two most frequent classes, Weather and Fiction, as well as the Other Magazine genre (some examples are in green cells). False positives are more recurrent in Other Magazine than in News, the relatively more frequent class. The reason is that News is a well defined genre occurring mostly at the same time each day unlike Other Magazine genre that encompasses various telecasts that are broadcast at several and irregular daytime. Teleshopping shows are often broadcast at nearly the same\ntime of morning than Cartoons and affects dramatically the performance of the 4n-gram model in this context (cf. underlined italic cell in Table 5). Finally, the confusion matrix of P4LSTM experiment shows that this system fails more dramatically to predict the least frequent genres Others, Reality TV, andDocumentary. For example, for the two least frequent genres, Reality TV and Documentary, respectively no more than one of the 76 and the 14 instances was correctly found. This leads to a precision and a recall of 0 which penalizes their averages respectively and then the overall F-score.\nIn order to evaluate the impact of the least frequent genres on the F1 measure, especially on the PLSTM systems, we also reported on Table 7 the F1 results on the same outputs of the experiments of Table 3 by excluding the two least frequent genres from the averages of precision and recall (Reality TV and Documentary).\nOverall, the results of the PLSTM detailed in Table 7 and Figure 4, demonstrate the benefits obtained at least for history sequences longer than 2 genres with an F1 score greater than\n71%.\nRegarding multichannel P4LSTM approach, the highest performance reaches an F1-measure of about 76% using 4 sized sequences with a gain of about 2 and 5 points compared respectively to P2LSTM and 4n-gram model best performances."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSION", "text": "The paper proposes an original Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based neural network architecture for automatic classification of multistream sequences called PLSTM. PLSTM is evaluated during a telecast genre prediction task and the observed results show that the proposed PLSTM is efficient when the size of sequences is large enough with a gain of more than 10 points of error rate compared to classical ngram model, and about 7 and 4 points respectively compared to LSTM and P2LSTM. Future works will apply this promising multistream neural network architecture to Spoken Language Understanding tasks such as topic extraction, keyword spotting and Part-of-Speech tagging."}, {"heading": "7.

Neural Networks (DNN) to automatically predict an outcome with respect to a sequence of inputs. Recurrent hidden cells allow these DNN-based models to manage long-term dependencies such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Nevertheless, these RNNs process a single input stream in one (LSTM) or two (Bidirectional LSTM) directions. But most of the information available nowadays is from multistreams or multimedia documents, and require RNNs to process these information synchronously during the training. This paper presents an original LSTM-based architecture, named Parallel LSTM (PLSTM), that carries out multiple parallel synchronized input sequences in order to predict a common output. The proposed PLSTM method could be used for parallel sequence classification purposes. The PLSTM approach is evaluated on an automatic telecast genre sequences classification task and compared with different state-of-theart architectures. Results show that the proposed PLSTM method outperforms the baseline n-gram models as well as the state-of-the-art LSTM approach.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
