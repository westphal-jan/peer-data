The Dempster rule of evidence combination corresponds to the join operator of the relational database theory. This rough-set based interpretation is qualitative in nature and can represent a number of belief function operators. 1"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Belief functions and their mathematical properties were investigated by A.P. Dempster in a series of papers in the late sixties [3]. They were intended as a generalisation of Bayesian inference in the sampling situation. In the mid-seventies G. Shafer [16] (who coined the term belief functions) developed a set of formal tools for the representation and combination of evidence. His aim was to construct a rather general theory, termed Mathematical Theory of Evidence, or MTE for short, for coping with uncertain but non-probabilistic information. In spite of its numerous interesting formal properties, the theory caused great discussion centred around the validity of the axioms and manageable interpretation of a belief function - see e.g. [3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 17, 23].\nDempster [3] initiated interval interpretation of MTE, which in fact is compatible with the random set theory [27]. H. Kyburg [9] showed that the belief function may be represented by an envelope of a family of probability functions and claimed that the behaviour of combining evidence via belief\n1Keywords: soft computing, knowledge representation and integration, DempsterShafer theory, rough set theory, relational databases, qualitative interpretation of Dempster rule. I.2.3, I.2.4.\nfunctions may be properly explained in statistics under proper independence assumptions. Hummel and Landy [7] considered MTE as a \u201dstatistics of expert opinions\u201d so that it \u201dcontains nothing more than Bayes\u2019 formula applied to Boolean assertions, . . . (and) tracks multiple opinion as opposed to a single probabilistic assessment\u201d. Pearl [12] and Provan [13] considered belief functions as \u201dprobabilities of provability\u201d. Still another view has been developed in connection with rough set theory [5, 21, 22, 23]. Belief function is considered there as the lower approximation of the set of possible decisions in a (partial) decision table. Fagin and Halpern [4] postulated probabilistic interpretation of MTE around lower and upper probability measures defined over a probability structure (rather than space). The list of other attempts is quite long.\nThough a tendency to consider belief functions as subjective uncertainty measures is visible [19], the need for case-based interpretation as a precondition for practical applicability has been explicitly stressed [25]. Still this interpretation should be qualitative rather than quantitative in nature [24]. However, these requirements seem not to be met so far.\nApart from manageable interpretation, the MTE caused troubles of purely numerical nature. Unlike ordinary probabilities, which assign mass to each possible outcome, belief functions assign mass to each subset of the outcome space. As a consequence the amount of memory space required to store a belief function in a computer will grow exponentially with the size of the outcome space we consider. Searching for economical representation of a belief function, the researches made use of the already known concepts of sets factorisation analysed in the theory of relational databases. In our search for non-quantitative interpretation of MTE, our attention was attracted by the nature of the join operator of relational databases [1] or in general the multivalued dependency [2] the study of which led to invention of local computation method for uncertainty propagation of Shenoy and Shafer [20] for MTE. This in turn made the rough-set theoretic interpretation of MTE belief functions of Skowron and Busse [23] best choice for further investigation, as it was purely-case based and relational, though it is frequency based. The rough-set interpretation sheds some light onto what the concept of \u201devidence\u201d may mean in experimental terms. The \u201devidence\u201d there is the information part of a database record and it \u201dsupports\u201d the decision part of a record. The complexity of combination of evidence according to the Dempster rule in [23] gave an impulse for search of a\nsimpler way to accomplish it. It turns out that with frequency approach updating of decision parts of cases is needed (Dempster\u2019s combination is destructive). Out of this experience we decided to abandon the frequencies and concentrated on purely relational operations.\nThe paper is organised as follows: Section 2 briefly introduces basic MTE concepts. Section 3 recalls traditional rough set theoretic frequency interpretation of MTE from [23] and explains our insights of destructive nature of Dempster\u2019s combination with respect to frequencies. Section 4 presents our new qualitative interpretation. The paper ends with some concluding remarks.\nThroughout the paper, as relational data tables are subject of rough set theory, SQL [26] query language is used to express semantics of MTE measures and operators in terms of decision tables, both with respect to traditional and our rough sets based interpretation of MTE, as SQL has the capability of expressing purely relational and frequentistic data processing."}, {"heading": "2 Basics of the Dempster-Shafer Theory", "text": "We understand MTE measures in a very traditional way (see [13]). Let \u039e be a finite set of elements called elementary events. Any subset of \u039e is a composite event, or hypothesis. \u039e be called also the frame of discernment. A basic probability (or belief) assignment (bpa) function is any set function m:2\u039e \u2192 [0, 1] such that\n\u2211\nA\u22082\u039e\nm(A) = 1 m(\u2205) = 0, \u2200A\u22082\u039e 0 \u2264 m(A)\nWe say that a bpa is vacuous iffm(\u039e) = 1 andm(A) = 0 for every A 6= \u039e. A belief function is defined as Bel:2\u039e \u2192 [0, 1] so that Bel(A) = \u2211\nB\u2286Am(B).\nA plausibility function is Pl:2\u039e \u2192 [0, 1] with \u2200A\u22082\u039ePl(A) = 1\u2212Bel(\u039e\u2212A). A commonality function is Q:2\u039e \u2212 {\u2205} \u2192 [0, 1] with \u2200A\u22082\u039e\u2212{\u2205} Q(A) =\u2211 A\u2286B m(B).\nThe Rule-of-Combination of two Independent Belief Functions BelE1 , BelE2 Over-the-Same-Frame-of-Discernment (the so-called DempsterRule), denoted BelE1,E2 = BelE1 \u2295 BelE2 is defined interms of bpa\u2019s as follows: mE1,E2(A) = c \u00b7 \u2211 B,C;A=B\u2229C mE1(B) \u00b7 mE2(C) (c - constant normalizing the sum of m to 1).\nUnder multivariate settings \u039e is a set of vectors in n-dimensional space spanned by the set of variables X={ X1,X2, . . . Xn}. If A \u2286 \u039e, then by projection A\u2193Y of the set A onto a subspace spanned by the set of variables Y \u2286 X we understand the set B of vectors from A projected onto Y. Then marginalization operator of MTE is defined as follows: m\u2193Y(B) = \u2211\nA;B=A\u2193X m(A).\nDefinition 1 (See [18]) Let B be a subset of \u039e, called evidence, mB be a basic probability assignment such that mB(B) = 1 and mB(A) = 0 for any A different from B. Then the conditional belief function Bel(.||B) representing the belief function Bel conditioned on evidence B is defined as: Bel(.||B) = Bel \u2295BelB."}, {"heading": "3 Rough Set Theory. The Traditional Interpreta-", "text": "tion of Belief Functions\nSkowron and Grzymala-Busse [23] and others studying rough sets developed more specifically the proposal of Shafer with respect to frequency interpretation of MTE.\nLet us introduce the following denotation concerning decision tables. Let a tuple \u00b5 mean a function \u00b5 : A \u2192 DOM(A), with A being a set of attributes Aj , DOM(Aj) being the domain of the attribute Aj, DOM(A) =\u22c3 Aj\u2208ADOM(Aj). A be called the scheme of \u00b5, A = S(\u00b5). A relational table TAB be any set of tuples with identical scheme. This common scheme be denoted by S(TAB). Let \u00b5[R] with R \u2286 S(\u00b5) denote the restriction of the tuple \u00b5 to the scheme R: \u00b5[R] = {(Aj , ajk)|Aj \u2208 R\u2227ajk = \u00b5(Aj)}. The restriction of a relational table TAB to R, denoted TAB[R], be defined TAB[R] = {\u00b5[R]|\u00b5 \u2208 TAB}. A relational join of two relational tables TAB1, TAB2 be defined as: TAB1 \u2297 TAB2 = {\u00b51 \u222a \u00b52|\u00b51 \u2208 TAB1, \u00b52 \u2208 TAB2 \u2227 \u2200Aj\u2208S(\u00b51)\u2229S(\u00b52) \u00b51(Aj) = \u00b52(Aj)}.\nA decision table is a relational table in which we split the scheme into\ntwo distinct parts: the information part I and the decision part D.\nLet card(SET ) denote the cardinality of the set SET. Let us assume that a decision table TAB of decisions D (atomic values) under conditions (information) I (atomic value vectors) is available. However, I may not contain the complete information to make decision D. This gives rise in a natural way to a mapping \u0393 assigning different values\nof D to the same value of I. Under these circumstances the belief in a set A (subset of the domain of D) Bel(A) may be derived from a case database as follows: Bel(A) = 1 \u2212 card({\u00b5|\u00b5 \u2208 TAB \u2227 \u00b5(D) 6\u2208 A})/card(TAB), which may be implemented the SQL query language [26] as:\ncreate view Total (Counted) as select count(*) from TAB; select count(*)/Counted from TAB,Total where not (I in (select I from TAB where not (D in A)));\nSkowron and Grzyma la-Busse[23] elaborated also a notion of conditioning under rough set interpretation [23, p.219 ff.] as respective measures for subtables (that is tables consisting of cases selected by a criterion). Let us condition on D belonging to the set B selecting tuples fitting the condition B Subtable = {\u00b5|\u00b5 \u2208 TAB \u2227 \u00b5(D) \u2208 B which may be implemented as\ncreate view SubtableTAB(D,I ) as select X,I from TAB where not (I in (select I from TAB where not (D in B)));\nThe belief distribution for the subtable can be calculated from the view SubtableTAB in the same way as for the TAB database. However, it is a matter of a calculation exercise to show that their notion of conditionality does not agree with that of Shafer from Def.1.\nTherefore, to achieve consistency with Shafer\u2019s conditioning from Def.1 we propose the following interpretation, derivable from our approach described in the paper [8]: Let v \u2208 B. Then in SQL\nupdate TAB set D=v where not (D in B) and I in (select I from TAB where D in B); delete TAB where not (D in B);\nLet c1,c2 be two cases from the database TAB such that I(c1) = I(c2) but D(c1) 6= D(c2) Let be D(c1) \u2208 B and D(c2) 6\u2208 B Then after the above update and delete operations both cases c1, c2 are retained in the database TAB. c1 has retained its value D(c1). But the case c2 was subject to a metamorphose: its D(c2) has been changed (to v). This means that the Dempster rule of combination is \u201ddestructive\u201d. Preservation of frequency interpretation under conditioning enforces ignoring the intrinsic (observed) value of an attribute and replacement of it with some other value. It should be stressed at this point that the above SQL operation cannot be easily expressed in terms of sets and relations, because an update operation is engaged which may make distinct tuples identical.\nA still more complex task is the interpretation of combination of two independent pieces of evidence. Skowron and Grzyma la-Busse[23] elaborated a procedure consisting in transforming the combined decision tables into a kind of summary with multivalued decision columns (since non-relational) and then applying complex rational arithmetic to get finally a decision table (derived by so-called \u03a8-independent combination) implementing Dempster combination of independent belief functions (consult [23] for details)."}, {"heading": "4 New Interpretation", "text": "Below we present a slight modification of the rough set interpretation of belief functions that surprisingly turns out to be both simple, elegant and straight forward and at the same time fulfils the requirement that was not matched by any known interpretations: it is qualitative and not quantitative in nature and still case-based. Furthermore we demonstrate that our new interpretation corresponds strictly to the notion of multivalued dependency, that is combination of belief functions parallels the relational join operator from database theory.\nThe results of any experiment with multiple outcomes can evaluated along two dimensions: the quantitative and the qualitative one. If we say e.g. that in a series of coin tossing experiments we got 57 heads and 43 tails, then this is a quantitative evaluation. But if we say that there were heads and tails (and not e.g. edges) then we say something about the qualitative aspects of the experiment. In the quantitative evaluation we say that 57 % of all the cases we got heads, in the qualitative evaluation we say that 50 % of all possibilities of diverse outcomes are heads. In most real life cases we are more interested in the quantitative aspects. Sometimes, however, the qualitative side may be of more interest. E.g. if 40 witnesses say that they saw the suspect had killed the victim, but their testimonies are suspiciously similar, and 20 say they saw the contrary, and their testimonies made impressions of individuality, then we would say that there are 1:20 chances of the guilt of the suspect rather than 40:20, because the qualitative aspects (diversity) are more important than quantitative ones (frequency).\nBehaviour of frequencies under reasoning was historically the foundation of probability theory. As probabilistic (frequency based) models of MTE fail in general, we considered just the diversity as a possible alternative for a model of MTE. The diversity is well handled by relational model\nof databases. Though at a first glance the count of cases in a relational database may appear identical with counting frequencies of objects / events, the difference starts as soon as we make a projection on the subset of attributes. It turns out that projected frequencies differ significantly from the counts of cases in a projected relational database. Therefore we say that our approach is non-frequency, non-quantitative, that is qualitative one.\nLet us define the plausibility PlTAB(SET ) derived from a decision table TAB with decision variable D and the set I of information variables as: PlTAB(SET ) = card({\u00b5[I]|\u00b5 \u2208 TAB \u2227 \u00b5(D) \u2208 SET})/card(TAB[I]), implemented as\ncreate view tmpTAB(No) as select count(distinct I) from TAB; create view plTAB as select count(distinct I)/No from TAB,tmpTAB where TAB.D in SET;\nExample 1 explains the detailed numerical procedure for calculation of\nPl from the above SQL expression.\nTheorem 1 The function PlTAB(SET ) derived from a decision table TAB with decision variable D and the set I of information variables is plausibility function Pl(SET ) in the sense of Dempster-Shafer theory.\nProof: In MTE, the plausibility of a set SET is just the sum of basic\nprobability assignments m(A) such that SET \u2229 A 6= \u2205. Let r be a record, I(r) its information part and D(r) its decision part. For the set SET, let us consider a subset R of all records from the decision table TAB such that: if r \u2208 R then D(r) \u2208 SET and for every d \u2208 SET there exists r\u2032 \u2208 R such that D(r) = D(r\u2032) and there exists no record r\u201d 6\u2208 R such that I(r\u201d) = I(r). Obviously, for two distinct sets SET \u2032 and SET\u201d their respective sets R\u2032 and R\u201d will share no records. Furthermore, \u22c3\nSET\u2286domain(D)R(SET ) will be the\n(relationally) identical with TAB. Hence we can consider the ratio number of records with distinct information part in R(SET ) divided by the number of records with distinct information parts in DT as the bpa function m(SET ) in the sense of MTE. But the function PlTAB(SET ) counts (the relative share of) the records with distinct information part such that the decision part belongs to SET. Hence\nExample 1 Let us first look at the relational table BUILD in tab. 1). The column D is the decision column, I is information part of the table. The domain of the decision variable D is {center, restaurant, school}.\nLet us calculate now the plausibility Pl({school, restaurant}) from this table. There are 7 cases (rows) in the dataset. But there are only 5 cases with distinct information part (firms) I. And there are only 3 cases with decision either school or restaurant with distinct information part I (LQR Inc., PTS Ltd., ZZZ Ltd).So the plausibility2is equal to Pl({school, restaurant})=3/5. One can check that Pl({school})=2/5 (LQR Inc., ZZZ Ltd) and Pl({restaurant})=2/5 (PTS Ltd., ZZZ Ltd). \u2738\nNotice that from the calculational rules for Dempster-Shafer theory we\ncan derive also relational views calculating other measures: Belief BelTAB(SET ) = 1 \u2212 card({\u00b5[I]|\u00b5 \u2208 TAB \u2227 \u00b5(D) 6\u2208 SET})/card(TAB[I]), implemented as\ncreate view belTAB as select 1-count(distinct I)/No from TAB,tmpTAB where not (TAB.D in SET);\n2Notice that under Skowron/Busse interpretation [23] we get P l = 4/7 which is obviously a different value. The difference stems from the fundamental difference between frequency (Skowron/Busse) and relational(ours) view of the world.\nCommonality QTAB(SET ) = card({\u00b5[I]|\u2200d\u2208SET \u00b5[I] \u222a {(D, d)} \u2208 TAB})\n/card(TAB[I]), implemented as\ncreate view tmp1TAB(CN) as select count(distinct D) from TAB where TAB.D in SET group by I ; create view qTAB as select count(*)/No from tmpTAB,tmp1TAB where CN=card(set); (card() is a function counting the elements of the set passed as its argument)\nBasic belief assignmentmTAB(SET ) = card({\u00b5[I]|\u2200d\u2208SET \u00b5[I]\u222a{(D, d)} \u2208\nTAB} \u2227 \u2200d6\u2208SET \u00b5[I] \u222a {(D, d)} 6\u2208 TAB})/card(TAB[I]), implemented as\ncreate view tmp11TAB(I,D) as select TAB.I, TAB.D+XX.D from TAB, TAB XX where TAB.D in SET and XX.I=TAB.I; create view tmp12TAB(I,CN) as select I,count(distinct D) from tmp11TAB group by I; create view m as count(*)/No from tmpTAB, tmp12TAB where CN=card(SET)*card(SET);\nTheorem 2 The functions BelTAB(SET ), QTAB(SET ), mTAB(SET ) derived from a decision table TAB with decision variable D and the set I of information variables are belief, commonality, basic probability/belief assignment functions resp. Bel(SET ), Q(SET ),m(SET ) in the sense of Dempster-Shafer theory.\nExample 2 From table 1 we easily calculate that: Commonality Q({school, restaurant}=1/5 (Number of firms ready to build either the school and the restaurant: ZZZ Ltd). Belief Q({school, restaurant}=2/5 Number of firms ready to build nothing but the school or the restaurant (LQR Inc., ZZZ Ltd) bpa - No of firms exactly offering erecting of: m({school, restaurant}=1/5 (ZZZ Ltd), m({restaurant}=0 (none), m({school}=1/5 (LQR Inc.)\n\u2738"}, {"heading": "4.1 Conditioning as Selection of a Subtable", "text": "Let us define now the conditional belief function BelTAB(.||B) representing the belief function Bel conditioned on evidence B as the belief function BelTAB B(.) define over the view table\nExample 3 In our example, for the relational table BUILD from tab. 1, BelBUILD(.||{school, restaurant}) is just Bel calculated from the respective projection select I,D from BUILD where D=school or D= restaurant visible in tab. 2.

The if-part parallels exactly theorem 4. We need\nonly pay attention to the fact that we never normalize. The only-if-part follows from numerical calculations for Q-values of all the tables considered. If a record is counted in DT when calculating Q\u2032DT (SET ), then it is also counted when calculating both Q\u2032DT1(SET ) and Q \u2032 DT2(SET ). If we form a join DT1 \u00b7 DT2 then Q\u2032DT1\u00b7DT2(SET ) = Q \u2032 DT1(SET ) \u00b7Q \u2032 DT2(SET ). And this is the maximum value Q\u2019 can take in DT12. If there is ANY deviation from multivariate dependency concerning records with decision part in SET, then value of Q\u2032DT12(SET ) is smaller than Q \u2032 DT1(SET ) \u00b7Q \u2032 DT2(SET ). This proves our claim. \u2737\nRemak: We can conclude that Dempster\u2019s rule of combination is equivalent with relational join and the Dempster-Shafer independence of evidence means multivalued dependence of evidence. We can also simulate other rules of combination of evidence. In the above, we assumed that given the decision, we cannot conclude from the information part I1 the value of the information part I2 in DT. This meant qualitative independence. Now let us assume the contrary in another decision table DT\u2019: given the decision d, we can totally predict I2 from I1 for all records r with D(r)=d in DT\u2019 or we can totally predict I1 from I2 for all records r with D(r)=d in DT\u2019. It is immediately clear that in this case for any set of decisions the unnormalized plausibility is calculated as Pl\u2032DT \u2032(A) = max(Pl\u2032 DT \u2032\u2193I1,D (A), P l\u2032 DT \u2032\u2193I2,D (A)). We can conclude for normalized plausibility that we deal here with the know rule of combination of dependent evidence: Pl\u2032DT \u2032(A) = max(\u03b1 \u00b7Pl \u2032 DT \u2032\u2193I1,D (A), (1\u2212\u03b1) \u00b7Pl\u2032 DT \u2032\u2193I2,D (A)) where \u03b1 ranges from 0 to 1 (depending on proportions between the numbers of distinct information parts I1 and I2)."}, {"heading": "4.4 Multivariate Beliefs and Multidecision Tables", "text": "We can extend our consideration to tables with multiple decision variables. In a straight forward way we can extend our definition of MTE measures to such tables and consider multivariate belief distributions (in all the decision variables). It is trivial to see that dropping a decision variables does not diminish the diversity of the information part. Hence dropping a decision variable Di from the set of decision variables D has the same effect\nas dropping a variable in the belief function. That is for any set B of decision vectors in variables D-{Di}: mTAB\u2193D\u2212{Di}(B) = m \u2193D\u2212{Di} TAB (B) = c \u00b7 \u2211\nA;B=A\u2193D\u2212{Di} m(A)TAB (c - normalizing factor) See table 5 for an ex-\nample.\nThe operator of projection \u2193 should be understood as the MTE projec-\ntion operator applied to a belief function.\nLet DTM be a decision table with decision variables D1 and D2. Let the information part consist of two disjoint parts I1 and I2. Let us consider the following views:\ncreate view DTM1 (I1,D1) as select distinct I1,D1 from DTM; create view DTM2 (I2,D2) as select distinct I2,D2 from DTM; create view DTM12 as select distinct I1,I2,D1,D2 from DTM1,DTM2;\nIf now the table DTM12 is relationally identical with DTM, then we shall say that the decision variables D1 and D2 are independent in the decision table DTM. It is not surprising that: BelDTM = Bel \u2193D1 DTM \u2295Bel \u2193D2 DTM . This means that independence of decision variables in a decision table implies independence of variables in the corresponding belief function. See table 6\nBel = Bel\u2193D \u2295Bel\u2193D2\nbecause the above table represents a cross product of the tables (without common columns)\nI2 D\n1. AAA GmbH school 2.

Let the information part consist of two disjoint parts I1 and I2. Let us consider the following views:\ncreate view DTX1 (I1,D1,D3) as select distinct I1,D1,D3 from DTX; create view DTX2 (I2,D2,D3) as select distinct I2,D2,D3 from DTX; create view DTX12 as select distinct I1,I2,D1,D2,D3 from DTX1,DTX2 where DTX1.D3=DTX2.D3;\nIf now the table DTX12 is relationally identical with DTX, then we shall say that the decision variables D1 and D2 are independent given D3 in the decision table DTX. It is not surprising that: BelDTX = Bel \u2193D1,D3 DTX \u2295 Bel\u2193D2,D3DTX . But this means that the variables D1 and D2 are independent given D3 in the belief function BelDTX in the sense of Shenoy\u2019s VBS [20]. See table 7 for an example.\nThese results mean that analysis of independence and conditional independence of variables in a belief function corresponding to a decision table may serve as an indicator of presence or absence of independence or multivalued dependence in the decision table."}, {"heading": "5 Concluding Remarks", "text": "A novel case-based interpretation of MTE belief functions which is qualitative in nature and has the potential to represent a number of MTE operations has been presented. The interpretation is based on rough sets (in connection with decision tables), but differs from previous interpretations of this type e.g. [23] in that it counts the diversity rather than frequencies in the decision table. The interpretation has the property that given a definition of the MTE measure of objects in the interpretation domain (decision table) we can perform operations in the interpretation domain (e.g. combining decision tables) and the measure of the resulting object is derivable from measures of component objects via MTE operator (e.g. combination). We demonstrated this property for Dempster rule of combination, marginalization, Shafer\u2019s conditioning, independent variables, Shenoy\u2019s notion of conditional independence of variables. Other known case-based (frequency or probabilistic) interpretations fall short of this property. E.g. in [23] complex rational number arithmetic, unnatural for decision tables, is needed to\nachieve compatibility of the final decision table with Dempster rule of combination. In [9] (probabilistic interpretation) only lower and upper bounds are found for Dempster rule. In [4] (probability structures interpretation) the belief function obtained from the Dempster rule is a potential, but not necessary result of the corresponding probabilistic structure combination operation. See also [24] for discussion of other interpretations.\nAs probabilistic (frequency based) models of MTE seem to fail in general, we looked for alternatives. The result of any experiment with multiple outcomes can evaluated along two dimensions: the quantitative and the qualitative one. In most real life cases we are more interested in the quantitative aspects. Sometimes, however, the qualitative side may be of more interest. E.g. legal applications we would treat suspiciously similar testimonies as a single argument in favour or against a hypothesis: we would rely on the count of diversity of arguments rather than on their actual counts. And MTE was claimed to be applicable just in legal reasoning [19]. Therefore we considered just the diversity as a possible alternative for a model of MTE and this idea turned out to very fruitful. The diversity is well handled by relational model of databases. Though at a first glance the count of cases in a relational database may appear identical with counting frequencies of objects / events, the difference starts as soon as we make a projection on the subset of attributes. It turns out that projected frequencies differ significantly from the counts of cases in a projected relational database. Therefore we say that our approach is non-frequency, non-quantitative, that is qualitative one.\nThe paper presents SQL statements performing the calculations of the\nMTE measures and the MTE related operations on the decision tables.\nThe new interpretation may be directly applied in the domain of multiple decision decision tables: independence of decision variables or Shenoy\u2019s conditional independence in the sense of MTE may serve as an indication of possibility of decomposition of the decision table into smaller but equivalent tables. Furthermore it may be applied in the area of Cooperative Query Answering [14]. The problem there is that a query posed to a local relational database system may contain an unknown attribute. But possibly other co-operating db systems know it and may explain it to the queried system in terms of known attributes, shared by the various systems. The uncertainties studied in the decision tables arise here in a natural way and our interpretation may be used to measure these uncertainties in terms of\nMTE (as diversity of support). Furthermore, if several co-operating systems respond, then the queried system may calculate the overall uncertainty measure using MTE combination of measures of individual responses.\nNow we can ask how to understand then a MTE belief function in the light of our experience. One possibility is to consider the belief function as a measure of diversity of support. This is an obvious departure from frequency interpretations proposed by Shafer and others. No mater how frequently the same piece of evidence is presented, it is counted once. This insight may encourage to revise other known interpretations of MTE. In the \u201dlegal\u201d interpretations e.g. [19], the witnesses in favor of a hypotheses should be counted separately, if their statements differ in unimportant details permitting to deduce that their statements are personal and not studied in. In the \u201dprobability of provability\u201d approach [11] not a probability of correctness, but rather the number of distinct valid proofs of a statement should be counted. In the \u201dpossible world semantics\u201d [15] the worlds should not be assigned a probability, but rather distinct possible worlds should be counted that differ in non-essential details. Then the operation of combination of independent evidence in the \u201dlegal\u201d interpretation is just mixing compatible statements of two sets of witnesses (which saw the same event from different perspective) and counting different possible combinations. In the \u201dprobability of provability\u201d approach the combination would mean putting together conclusion compatible proofs stemming from distinct domains (e.g. macro and micro-physical observations) and counting legal combinations. In the possible worlds semantics we may combine worlds spanned over disjoined sets of dimensions.\nPlease notice also that the rough-set interpretation sheds some light onto what the concept of \u201devidence\u201d may mean. The \u201devidence\u201d are just different sets of information attributes and the \u201dindependence\u201d means (deterministic) unpredictability of attribute values of the one set from the other set. This should not be confused with predictability of the decision variable. Nor with stochastic predictability which may be present. In the \u201dlegal\u201d interpretation, independence would be measured with non-predictability of insignificant details. In the \u201dprovability\u201d interpretation the independence may be measured by mutual non-derivability of the sets of underlying axioms. In the possible world semantics by possibility of putting together projections onto separated sets of dimension axes.\nFurther studies on interpreting other known MTE operators in the spirit\nof qualitative interpretation presented in this paper are needed and may reveal new potential applications of MTE to real world problems."}], "references": [{"title": "On the desirability of acyclic database schemes", "author": ["C.
