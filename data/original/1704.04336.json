INTRODUCTION", "text": "Discourse Coherence Modeling (DCM) aims to evaluate a degree of coherence among sentences within a discourse or text. It is considered one of the key problems in Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to its wide usage in many NLP applications, such as statistical machine translation[1], discourse generation[2][3][4], text automation summarization[3][5][6], student essay scoring [7][8][9] .\nIn general, a coherent discourse generally has many similar components (lexical overlap or coreference) across sentences within a text, while incoherent discourse is the other one. Therefore, the traditional cohesion theory of Centering[10] driven and entity-based model[11][12][13][14]was proposed to capture the syntactic or semantic distribution of discourse entities (nouns) between two adjacent sentences in a text. Thereafter, many extension works were presented such as Feng and Hirst [15] \u2019s multiple ranking model, Lin et al. [16] \u2019s discourse relationbased approach, Louis and Nenkova[17]\u2019s syntactic patterns-based model. However, the potential issue of the existing traditional coherence models need feature engineering, which is a timeconsuming job.\nIn order to overcome the limitation of feature engineering issue, modern research tries to use neural network to extract the syntactic or semantic representation of a sentence automatically. Li et al.[18]proposed neural deep model to deal with English discourse coherence evaluation. However, their discourse coherence model only focuses on the distributed representation for\nsentences, and did not consider the entity (nouns) distribution across sentences. In fact, the entities can be overlapped between two adjacent sentences, and are good insight to capture the coherence between adjacent two sentences as mentioned in traditional entity-based method. Therefore, we successfully integrate this kind of information into current recursive neural network framework. Evaluation results on both sentence ordering and machine translation coherence rating task show the effectiveness of the proposed model, which significantly outperforms the existing strong baseline.\nTherefore, this paper tries to answer the following three questions:\n(1) Can the current English discourse coherence models (traditional or neural method) work for Chinese discourse coherence evaluation task? (2) Can the traditional entity based model be integrated into current deep model? (3) Which kind of word embedding works better for Chinese discourse coherence evaluation?\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related work on discourse coherence modeling. Section 3 introduces the framework of our entity-driven recursive neural network based Chinese discourse coherence model. Section 4 describes the experiment results and detailed analysis. Finally, some conclusions are drawn in Section 5."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "In this section, we describe the related work for discourse coherence modeling from traditional and neural network modes, respectively."}, {"heading": "2.1. TRADITIONAL COHERENCE MODEL", "text": "The task of DCM was first introduced by Foltz et al.[19]. They formulated the discourse coherence as a function of semantic relatedness between two adjacent sentences within a text, and employed a vector-based representation of lexical meaning to compute the semantic relatedness. Since then, many supervised approaches to DCM, such as the entity-based model[11][12][13][15], discourse relation-based model [16] , syntactic patterns-based model [17] , co reference resolution-based model [20][21] , content-based model via Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [3][22] and cohesion-driven based model[23] have been proposed in literature.\nTo be more specific, Barzilay and Lapata [11][12] presented an entity-based model to capture the distribution of discourse entities between two adjacent sentences within a text. As an extensive work of entity-based approach, Lin et al.[16] explored the function of discourse relations to revise the entity and to catch the behavior of discourse relation transfer among sentences. In addition, Feng and Hirst[15] showed that multiple ranking instead of pair wise ranking was effective for the DCM.\nDifferently, Louis and Nenkova[17] explored the function of syntactic structure in the DCM. Besides, Iida et al.[20] and Elsner et al.[21] demonstrated the importance of the usage of co reference resolution. In addition, Barzilay et al. [3] and Elsner et al. [22] showed that an Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based content model can be used to capture the topic\u2019s transfer from the first sentence to the end sentence of a text, where topics were formulated as hidden states and sentences were treated as observations. Still, a potential issue of the HMM model is its domaindependent mechanism. Also, Xu et al.[23] explored the impact of Halliday[24]\u2019s Theme Structure Theory (TST) in English discourse coherence modeling. Their model shows the importance of the theme structure, a cohesion theory of Halliday\u2019s systemic-functional grammar, to DCM, and the appropriateness of theme and co reference based filtering mechanism."}, {"heading": "2.2. NEURAL COHERENCE MODEL", "text": "Recently, Li et al.[18]presented a neural deep model for English discourse coherence modeling. They demonstrated the effectiveness of both recurrent and recursive neural network (RNN) model for English situation.\nHowever, as mentioned in the Section 1, their model did not consider the entity (nouns) distribution or entity overlap across sentences within a text. In fact, the entity overlap between two adjacent sentences indicates logical or semantic coherence for para text. Therefore, we successfully integrate these information into their model."}, {"heading": "3.

[18] \u2019s English discourse coherence framework. On comparison, their model doesn\u2019t intensify the effectiveness of entities across each sentences in a text. Therefore, we successfully integrate the entities into current recursive neural network model."}, {"heading": "3.2. SENTENCE REPRESENTATION", "text": "For the word-level representation, each word in a sentence can be represented by using a vector representation (or word embedding), and are able to capture the semantic meanings through toolkit, e.g. word2vec 1 or Glove 2 . More specifically, the word of a sentence can be represented using a specific vector embedding ew={ew 1 ,ew 2 ,\u2026,ew K},where K denotes the dimension of the word embedding.\n1http://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ 2http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/\nFor the sentence-level representation, as shown in Figure 1, the vector representation for the whole sentence is computed as a representation for each parent node based on its immediate children recursively in a bottom-up fashion until reaching the root of the tree. Concretely, for a given parent p in the tree and its two children c1(associated with vector representation hc1) and c2(associated with vector representation hc2), standard recursive network calculates hpfor p as follows:\nhp=f(WRecursive.[hc1, hc2]+bRecursive) (1)\nwhere [hc1, hc2] refers to the concatenating vector for children vector hc1 and hc2;WRecursive is a k*2K matrix and bRecursive is the K*1 bias vector; f(.) is tanh function."}, {"heading": "3.3. ENTITY-DRIVEN SENTENCE CONVOLUTION", "text": "The framework treats a window of sentences as a clique C(sliding windows of L sentences)and associates each clique with a tag yc that takes the value 1 if coherent, and 0 otherwise. As shown in Figure 1, each clique C takes as input a (L*K)*1vector hc by concatenating the embedding of all its contained sentences. The hidden layer takes as input hc and performs the convolution using a non-linear tanh function. The concatenating output vector for hidden layers, defined as qc, can therefore be rewritten as:\nqc=f(Wsen*(hc*hentity)+bsen) (2)\nwhere Wsen is a H*(L*K) dimensional matrix and bsen is a H*1 dimensional bias vector; H refers to the number of neurons in the hidden layer."}, {"heading": "3.3.1. ENTITY-DRIVEN MECHANISM", "text": "Firstly, we conduct vector summation operation for each nouns\u2019 word embedding to generate hentity formulated as:\nHentity=ewNN1 \u2295 ewNN2\u2295\u2026\u2026\u2295 ewNNk (3)\nThen, we conduct element wise multiplication operation between hc and hentity.\nThe value of the output layer can be formulated as:\nP(yc=1)=sigmod(U T qc+b) (4)\nwhere U is an H*1 vector and b denotes the bias; yc with value 1 means the text is coherent, and 0 otherwise.\nTherefore, the total coherence score for a given document is the probability that all cliques within the document are coherent, which is given by:\nSd=\u220f \u2208 = dC cyp )1(\n(5)\nFinally, we can determine whether a text is coherent according to the value of their coherence score."}, {"heading": "3.4.

EXPERIMENTS", "text": "In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our discourse coherence model through both sentence ordering and machine translation coherence rating tasks.
