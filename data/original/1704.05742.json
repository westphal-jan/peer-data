Recently, neuralbased models for multi-task learning have become very popular, ranging from computer vision (Misra et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2014) to natural language processing (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Luong et al., 2015), since they provide a convenient way of combining information from multiple tasks.\nHowever, most existing work on multi-task learning (Liu et al., 2016c,b) attempts to divide the features of different tasks into private and shared spaces, merely based on whether parameters of\nsome components should be shared. As shown in Figure 1-(a), the general shared-private model introduces two feature spaces for any task: one is used to store task-dependent features, the other is used to capture shared features. The major limitation of this framework is that the shared feature space could contain some unnecessary taskspecific features, while some sharable features could also be mixed in private space, suffering from feature redundancy.\nTaking the following two sentences as examples, which are extracted from two different sentiment classification tasks: Movie reviews and Baby products reviews.\nThe infantile cart is simple and easy to use. This kind of humour is infantile and boring.\nThe word \u201cinfantile\u201d indicates negative sentiment in Movie task while it is neutral in Baby task. However, the general shared-private model could place the task-specific word \u201cinfantile\u201d in a shared space, leaving potential hazards for other tasks. Additionally, the capacity of shared space could also be wasted by some unnecessary features.\nTo address this problem, in this paper we propose an adversarial multi-task framework, in which the shared and private feature spaces are in-\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n05 74\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n9 A\npr 2\n01 7\nherently disjoint by introducing orthogonality constraints. Specifically, we design a generic sharedprivate learning framework to model the text sequence. To prevent the shared and private latent feature spaces from interfering with each other, we introduce two strategies: adversarial training and orthogonality constraints. The adversarial training is used to ensure that the shared feature space simply contains common and task-invariant information, while the orthogonality constraint is used to eliminate redundant features from the private and shared spaces.\nThe contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.\n1. Proposed model divides the task-specific and shared space in a more precise way, rather than roughly sharing parameters. 2. We extend the original binary adversarial training to multi-class, which not only enables multiple tasks to be jointly trained, but allows us to utilize unlabeled data. 3. We can condense the shared knowledge among multiple tasks into an off-the-shelf neural layer, which can be easily transferred to new tasks."}, {"heading": "2 Recurrent Models for Text Classification", "text": "There are many neural sentence models, which can be used for text modelling, involving recurrent neural networks (Sutskever et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015a), convolutional neural networks (Collobert et al., 2011; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014), and recursive neural networks (Socher et al., 2013). Here we adopt recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (LSTM) due to their superior performance in various NLP tasks (Liu et al., 2016a; Lin et al., 2017).\nLong Short-term Memory Long short-term memory network (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) (Elman, 1990), and specifically addresses the issue of learning long-term dependencies. While there are numerous LSTM variants, here we use the LSTM architecture used by (Jozefowicz et al., 2015), which is similar to the architecture of (Graves, 2013) but without peep-hole connections.\nWe define the LSTM units at each time step t to be a collection of vectors in Rd: an input gate it, a\nforget gate ft, an output gate ot, a memory cell ct and a hidden state ht. d is the number of the LSTM units. The elements of the gating vectors it, ft and ot are in [0, 1].\nThe LSTM is precisely specified as follows.\n c\u0303t ot it ft  =  tanh \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3 (Wp [ xtht\u22121 ] + bp ) , (1)\nct = c\u0303t it + ct\u22121 ft, (2) ht = ot tanh (ct) , (3)\nwhere xt \u2208 Re is the input at the current time step; Wp \u2208 R4d\u00d7(d+e) and bp \u2208 R4d are parameters of affine transformation; \u03c3 denotes the logistic sigmoid function and denotes elementwise multiplication.\nThe update of each LSTM unit can be written precisely as follows:\nht = LSTM(ht\u22121,xt, \u03b8p). (4)\nHere, the function LSTM(\u00b7, \u00b7, \u00b7, \u00b7) is a shorthand for Eq. (1-3), and \u03b8p represents all the parameters of LSTM.\nText Classification with LSTM Given a text sequence x = {x1, x2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xT }, we first use a lookup layer to get the vector representation (embeddings) xi of the each word xi. The output at the last moment hT can be regarded as the representation of the whole sequence, which has a fully connected layer followed by a softmax non-linear layer that predicts the probability distribution over classes.\ny\u0302 = softmax(WhT + b) (5)\nwhere y\u0302 is prediction probabilities, W is the weight which needs to be learned, b is a bias term.\nGiven a corpus with N training samples (xi, yi), the parameters of the network are trained to minimise the cross-entropy of the predicted and true distributions.\nL(y\u0302, y) = \u2212 N\u2211 i=1 C\u2211 j=1 yji log(y\u0302 j i ), (6)\nwhere yji is the ground-truth label; y\u0302 j i is prediction probabilities, and C is the class number.\nsoftmax Lmtask\nLSTM\nsoftmax Lntask\nxm xn\n(a) Fully Shared Model (FS-MTL)"}, {"heading": "3 Multi-task Learning for Text Classification", "text": "The goal of multi-task learning is to utilizes the correlation among these related tasks to improve classification by learning tasks in parallel. To facilitate this, we give some explanation for notations used in this paper. Formally, we refer to Dk as a dataset with Nk samples for task k. Specifically,\nDk = {(xki , yki )} Nk i=1 (7)\nwhere xki and y k i denote a sentence and corresponding label for task k."}, {"heading": "3.1 Two Sharing Schemes for Sentence Modeling", "text": "The key factor of multi-task learning is the sharing scheme in latent feature space. In neural network based model, the latent features can be regarded as the states of hidden neurons. Specific to text classification, the latent features are the hidden states of LSTM at the end of a sentence. Therefore, the sharing schemes are different in how to group the shared features. Here, we first introduce two sharing schemes with multi-task learning: fully-shared scheme and shared-private scheme.\nFully-Shared Model (FS-MTL) In fully-shared model, we use a single shared LSTM layer to extract features for all the tasks. For example, given two tasks m and n, it takes the view that the features of task m can be totally shared by task n and vice versa. This model ignores the fact that some features are task-dependent. Figure 2a illustrates the fully-shared model.\nShared-Private Model (SP-MTL) As shown in Figure 2b, the shared-private model introduces two feature spaces for each task: one is used to store task-dependent features, the other is used to capture task-invariant features. Accordingly, we can see each task is assigned a private LSTM layer and shared LSTM layer. Formally, for any sentence in task k, we can compute its shared representation skt and task-specific representation h k t as follows:\nskt = LSTM(xt, s k t\u22121, \u03b8s), (8)\nhkt = LSTM(xt,h m t\u22121, \u03b8k) (9)\nwhere LSTM(., \u03b8) is defined as Eq. (4). The final features are concatenation of the features from private space and shared space."}, {"heading": "3.2 Task-Specific Output Layer", "text": "For a sentence in task k, its feature h(k), emitted by the deep muti-task architectures, is ultimately fed into the corresponding task-specific softmax layer for classification or other tasks.\nThe parameters of the network are trained to minimise the cross-entropy of the predicted and true distributions on all the tasks. The loss Ltask can be computed as:\nLTask = K\u2211 k=1 \u03b1kL(y\u0302 (k), y(k)) (10)\nwhere \u03b1k is the weights for each task k respectively. L(y\u0302, y) is defined as Eq. 6."}, {"heading": "4 Incorporating Adversarial Training", "text": "Although the shared-private model separates the feature space into the shared and private spaces, there is no guarantee that sharable features can not exist in private feature space, or vice versa. Thus, some useful sharable features could be ignored in shared-private model, and the shared feature space is also vulnerable to contamination by some taskspecific information.\nTherefore, a simple principle can be applied into multi-task learning that a good shared feature space should contain more common information and no task-specific information. To address this problem, we introduce adversarial training into multi-task framework as shown in Figure 3 (ASPMTL)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Adversarial Network", "text": "Adversarial networks have recently surfaced and are first used for generative model (Goodfellow et al., 2014). The goal is to learn a generative distribution pG(x) that matches the real data distribution Pdata(x) Specifically, GAN learns a generative network G and discriminative model D, in which G generates samples from the generator distribution pG(x). and D learns to determine whether a sample is from pG(x) or Pdata(x). This min-max game can be optimized by the following risk:\n\u03c6 = min G max D\n( Ex\u223cPdata [logD(x)]\n+ Ez\u223cp(z)[log(1\u2212D(G(z)))] )\n(11)\nWhile originally proposed for generating random samples, adversarial network can be used as a general tool to measure equivalence between distributions (Taigman et al., 2016). Formally, (Ajakan et al., 2014) linked the adversarial loss to the H-divergence between two distributions and successfully achieve unsupervised domain adaptation with adversarial network. Motivated by theory on domain adaptation (Ben-David et al., 2010, 2007; Bousmalis et al., 2016) that a transferable feature is one for which an algorithm cannot learn to identify the domain of origin of the input observation."}, {"heading": "4.2 Task Adversarial Loss for MTL", "text": "Inspired by adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014), we proposed an adversarial sharedprivate model for multi-task learning, in which a shared recurrent neural layer is working adversarially towards a learnable multi-layer perceptron, preventing it from making an accurate prediction about the types of tasks. This adversarial training encourages shared space to be more pure and ensure the shared representation not be contaminated by task-specific features.\nTask Discriminator Discriminator is used to map the shared representation of sentences into a probability distribution, estimating what kinds of tasks the encoded sentence comes from.\nD(skT , \u03b8D) = softmax(b+Us k T ) (12)\nwhere U \u2208 Rd\u00d7d is a learnable parameter and b \u2208 Rd is a bias.\nAdversarial Loss Different with most existing multi-task learning algorithm, we add an extra task adversarial loss LAdv to prevent task-specific feature from creeping in to shared space. The task adversarial loss is used to train a model to produce shared features such that a classifier cannot reliably predict the task based on these features. The original loss of adversarial network is limited since it can only be used in binary situation. To overcome this, we extend it to multi-class form, which allow our model can be trained together with multiple tasks:\nLAdv = min \u03b8s ( \u03bbmax \u03b8D ( K\u2211 k=1 Nk\u2211 i=1 dki log[D(E(x k))]) ) (13)\nwhere dki denotes the ground-truth label indicating the type of the current task. Here, there is a minmax optimization and the basic idea is that, given a sentence, the shared LSTM generates a representation to mislead the task discriminator. At the same time, the discriminator tries its best to make a correct classification on the type of task. After the training phase, the shared feature extractor and task discriminator reach a point at which both cannot improve and the discriminator is unable to differentiate among all the tasks.\nSemi-supervised Learning Multi-task Learning We notice that the LAdv requires only the input sentence x and does not require the corresponding label y, which makes it possible to combine our model with semi-supervised learning. Finally, in this semi-supervised multi-task learning framework, our model can not only utilize the data from related tasks, but can employ abundant unlabeled corpora."}, {"heading": "4.3 Orthogonality Constraints", "text": "We notice that there is a potential drawback of the above model.

The parameters of transferred layer are kept frozen, and the rest of parameters of the network MT are randomly initialized.\nMore formally, we investigate two mechanisms towards the transferred shared extractor. As shown in Figure 4. The first one Single Channel (SC) model consists of one shared feature extractor Es from MS , then the extracted representation will be sent to an output layer. By contrast, the BiChannel (BC) model introduces an extra LSTM layer to encode more task-specific information. To evaluate the effectiveness of our introduced adversarial training framework, we also make a compar-\nison with vanilla multi-task learning method.\nResults and Analysis As shown in Table 3, we can see the shared layer from ASP-MTL achieves a better performance compared with SP-MTL. Besides, for the two kinds of transfer strategies, the Bi-Channel model performs better. The reason is that the task-specific layer introduced in the BiChannel model can store some private features. Overall, the results indicate that we can save the existing knowledge into a shared recurrent layer using adversarial multi-task learning, which is quite useful for a new task."}, {"heading": "5.6 Visualization", "text": "To get an intuitive understanding of how the introduced orthogonality constraints worked compared with vanilla shared-private model, we design an experiment to examine the behaviors of neurons from private layer and shared layer.

By visualizing the hidden state hj and analyzing the maximum activation, we can find what kinds of patterns the current neuron focuses on.\nFigure 5 illustrates this phenomenon. Here, we randomly sample a sentence from the validation set of Baby task and analyze the changes of the predicted sentiment score at different time steps, which are obtained by SP-MTL and our proposed model. Additionally, to get more insights into how neurons in shared layer behave diversely towards different input word, we visualize the activation of two typical neurons. For the positive sentence \u201cFive stars, my baby can fall asleep soon in the stroller\u201d, both models capture the informative pattern \u201cFive stars\u201d 6. However, SP-MTL makes a wrong prediction due to misunderstanding of the word \u201casleep\u201d.\nBy contrast, our model makes a correct prediction and the reason can be inferred from the activation of Figure 5-(b), where the shared layer of SP-MTL is so sensitive that many features related to other tasks are included, such as \u201dasleep\u201d, which misleads the final prediction.

Clearly, suppose we have many tasks to be trained jointly, the shared layer bear much pressure and must sacrifice substantial amount of capacity to capture the patterns they actually do not need. Furthermore, some typical taskinvariant features also go into task-specific layer. 2) for ASP-MTL, we find the features captured by shared and task-specific layer have a small amount of intersection, which allows these two kinds of layers can work effectively."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "There are two threads of related work.

In this paper, we propose an adversarial multi-task learning framework, alleviating the shared and private latent feature spaces from interfering with each other. We conduct extensive experiments on 16 different text classification tasks, which demonstrates the benefits of our approach. Besides, we show that the shared knowledge learned by our proposed model can be regarded as off-the-shelf knowledge and easily transferred to new tasks.
