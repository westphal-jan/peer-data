INTRODUCTION\nDrug-drug interaction (DDI) is a situation when one drug increases or decreases the effect of another drug [1]. Adverse drug reactions may cause severe side effect, if two or more medicines were taken and their DDI were not investigated in detail. DDI is a common cause of illness, even a cause of death [2]. Thus, DDI databases for clinical medication decisions are proposed by some researchers. These databases such as SFINX [3], KEGG [4], CredibleMeds [5] help physicians and pharmacists avoid most adverse drug reactions.\nTraditional DDI databases are manually constructed by medical experts from clinical records, scientific research and drug specifications. For instance, The sentence \u201cWith combined use, clinicians should be aware, when phenytoin is added, of the potential for reexacerbation of pulmonary symptomatology due to lowered serum theophylline concentrations [6]\u201d, which is from a pharmacotherapy report, describe the side effect of phenytoin and theophylline\u2019s combined use. Then this information on specific medicines will be added to DDI databases. As drug-drug interactions have being increasingly found, manually constructing DDI database would consume a lot of manpower and resources.\nThere has been many efforts to automatically extract DDIs from natural language [1], [7]\u2013[13], mainly medical literature and clinical records. These works can be divided into the following categories: \u2022 Text analysis and statistics based approach [1], [7], [14].\nThis kind of work utilizes NLP tools to analysis biomedical text\u2019s semantics or statistics features (such as TFIDF) before the DDI decision. However, the semantics and statistics features are insufficient for understanding\nthe whole text. Even worse, NLP toolkits are imperfect and may propagate error to the classification. \u2022 Feature based machine learning approach [8], [11], [12], [15], [16]. Such method always need complex feature engineering. In addition, the quality of feature engineering have a great effect on the precision of DDI classification, which becomes the shortcoming of such method. \u2022 Deep learning based approach [9], [10], [13]. Deep learning neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM), have been utilized for DDI extraction. Deep learning method avoids complicated feature engineering since CNN and LSTM can extract semantics features automatically through a well designed network.\nTo avoid complex feature engineering and NLP toolkits\u2019 usage, we employ the deep learning approach for sentence comprehension as a whole. Our model takes in a sentence from biomedical literature which contains a drug pair and outputs what kind of DDI this drug pair belongs. This assists physicians refrain from improper combined use of drugs. In addition, the word and sentence level attentions are introduced to our model for better DDI predictions."}, {"heading": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "In DDI extraction task, NLP methods or machine learning approaches are proposed by most of the work. Chowdhury [15] and Thomas et al. [12] proposed methods that use linguistic phenomenons and two-stage SVM to classify DDIs. FBK-irst [11] is a follow-on work which applies kernel method to the existing model and outperforms it.\nNeural network based approaches have been proposed by several works. Liu et al. [10] employ CNN for DDI extraction for the first time which outperforms the traditional machine learning based methods. Limited by the convolutional kernel size, the CNN can only extracted features of continuous 3 to 5 words rather than distant words. Liu et al. [9] proposed dependency-based CNN to handle distant but relevant words. Sahu et al. [13] proposed LSTM based DDI extraction approach and outperforms CNN based approach, since LSTM handles sentence as a sequence instead of slide windows. To conclude, Neural network based approaches have advantages of 1) less reliance on extra NLP toolkits, 2) simpler preprocessing procedure, 3) better performance than text analysis and machine learning methods.\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n03 26\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 9\nM ay\n2 01\n7\nDrug-drug interaction extraction is a relation extraction task of natural language processing. Relation extraction aims to determine the relation between two given entities in a sentence. In recent years, attention mechanism and various neural networks are applied to relation extraction [17]\u2013[21]. Convolutional deep neural network are utilized for extracting sentence level features in [19]. Then the sentence level features are concatenated with lexical level features, which are obtained by NLP toolkit WordNet [22], followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to classify the entities\u2019 relation. A fixed work is proposed by Nguyen et al. [21]. The convolutional kernel is set various size to capture more n-gram features. In addition, the word and position embedding are trained automatically instead of keeping constant as in [19]. Wang et al. [20] introduce multi-level attention mechanism to CNN in order to emphasize the keywords and ignore the non-critical words during relation detection. The attention CNN model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.\nBesides CNN, Recurrent neural network (RNN) has been applied to relation extraction as well. Zhang et al. [18] utilize long short-term memory network (LSTM), a typical RNN model, to represent sentence. The bidirectional LSTM chronologically captures the previous and future information, after which a pooling layer and MLP have been set to extract feature and classify the relation. Attention mechanism is added to bidirectional LSTM in [17] for relation extraction. An attention layer gives each memory cell a weight so that classifier can catch the principal feature for the relation detection. The Attention based bidirectional LSTM has been proven better than previous work."}, {"heading": "III. PROPOSED MODEL", "text": "In this section, we present our bidirectional recurrent neural network with multiple attention layer model. The overview of our architecture is shown in Fig. 1. For a given instance, which describes the details about two or more drugs, the model represents each word as a vector in embedding layer. Then the bidirectional RNN layer generates a sentence matrix, each column vector in which is the semantic representation of the corresponding word. The word level attention layer transforms the sentence matrix to vector representation. Then sentence level attention layer generates final representation for the instance by combining several relevant sentences in view of the fact that these sentences have the same drug pair. Followed by a softmax classifier, the model classifies the drug pair in the given instance as specific DDI."}, {"heading": "A.

Bidirectional RNN Encoding Layer", "text": "The words in the sequence are read by RNN\u2019s gated recurrent unit (GRU) one by one. The GRU takes the current word xi and the previous GRU\u2019s hidden state hi\u22121 as input. The current GRU encodes hi\u22121 and xi into a new hidden state hi (its dimension is dh, a hyperparameter), which can be regarded as informations the GRU remembered.\nFig. 2 shows the details in GRU. The reset gate ri selectively forgets informations delivered by previous GRU. Then the hidden state becomes h\u0303i. The update gate zi updates the informations according to h\u0303i and hi\u22121. The equations below describe these procedures. Note that \u2297 stands for element wise multiplication.\nri = \u03c3(Wrxi + Urhi\u22121) (2)\nh\u0303i = \u03a6(Wxi + U(ri \u2297 hi\u22121)) (3)\nzi = \u03c3(Wzxi + Uzhi\u22121) (4)\nhi = zi \u2297 hi\u22121 + ((1, 1, ..., 1)T \u2212 zi)\u2297 h\u0303i (5)\nThe bidirectional RNN contains forward RNN and backward RNN. Forward RNN reads sentence from x1 to xt, generating \u2212\u2192 h 1, \u2212\u2192 h 2, ..., \u2212\u2192 h t.

Hyperparameter Settings and Training", "text": "We use TensorFlow to implement the proposed model. The input of each word is an ordered triple (word, relative position 1, relative position 2). The sentence, which is represented as a matrix, is fed to the model. The output of the model is a |C|-dimension vector representing the probabilities of\nbeing corresponding DDI. It is the network, parameters, and hyperparameters which decides the output vector. The network\u2019s parameters are adjusted during training, where the hyperparameters are tuned by hand. The hyperparameters after tuning are as follows. The word embedding\u2019s dimension dWE = 100, the position embedding\u2019s dimension dPE = 10, the hidden state\u2019s dimension dh = 230, the probability of dropout Prd = 0.5.\nThe word embedding is initialized by pre-trained word vectors using GloVe [27], while other parameters are initialized randomly. During each training step, a mini-batch (the minibatch size |M| = 60 in our implementation) of sentences is selected from training set. The gradient of objective function is calculated for parameters updating (See Section III-E).\nFig. 3 shows the training process. The objective function J(\u03b8) is declining as the training mini-batches continuously sent to the model. As the testing mini-batches, the J(\u03b8) function is fluctuating while its overall trend is descending. The instances in testing set are not participated in training so that J(\u03b8) function is not descending so fast. However, training and testing instances have similar distribution in sample space, causing that testing instances\u2019 J(\u03b8) tends to be smaller along with the training process. J(\u03b8) has inverse relationship with the performance measurement. The F1 score is getting fluctuating around a specific value after enough training steps. The\nreason why fluctuating range is considerable is that only a tiny part of the whole training or testing set has been calculated the F1 score. Testing the whole set during every step is time consuming and not necessary. We will evaluate the model on whole testing set in Section IV-C."}, {"heading": "C. Experimental Results", "text": "We save our model every 100 step and predict all the DDIs of the instances in the testing set. These predictions\u2019 F1 score is shown in Fig. 4. To demonstrate the sentence level attention layer is effective, we drop this layer and then directly use h\u2217 for softmax classification (See Fig. 1). The result is shown with \u201cRNN + dynamic word embedding + ATT\u201d curve, which illustrates that the sentence level attention layer contributes to a more accurate model.\nWhether a dynamic or static word embedding is better for a DDI extraction task is under consideration. Nguyen et al. [21] shows that updating word embedding at the time of other parameters being trained makes a better performance in relation extraction task. We let the embedding be static when training, while other conditions are all the same. The \u201cRNN + static word embedding + 2ATT\u201d curve shows this case. We can draw a conclusion that updating the initialized word embedding trains more suitable word vectors for the task, which promotes the performance.\nWe compare our best F1 score with other state-of-theart approaches in Table II, which shows our model has competitive advantage in dealing with drug-drug interaction extraction. The predictions confusion matrix is shown in Table III. The DDIs other than false being classified as false makes most of the classification error. It may perform better if a classifier which can tells true and false DDI apart is trained. We leave this two-stage classifier to our future work. Another phenomenon is that the \u201cInt\u201d type is often classified as \u201cEffect\u201d. The \u201cInt\u201d sentence describes there exists interaction between two drugs and this information implies the two drugs\u2019 combination will have good or bed effect. That\u2019s the reason why \u201cInt\u201d and \u201cEffect\u201d are often obfuscated."}, {"heading": "V.

However, the existing work need either complex feature engineering or NLP tools, both of which are insufficient for sentence comprehension. Inspired by the deep learning approaches in natural language processing, we propose a recurrent neural network model with multiple attention layers for DDI classification. We evaluate our model on 2013 SemEval DDIExtraction dataset. The experiments show that our model classifies most of the drug pairs into correct DDI categories, which outperforms the existing NLP or deep learning method.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
