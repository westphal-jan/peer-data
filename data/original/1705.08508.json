INTRODUCTION\nSecurity surveillance is one of the most important issues in smart cities. Due to the continuous growth of cities in size and complexity, keeping cities safe becomes critical to attracting skilled people and investments necessary for economic growth and development. Compounded by terrorism, cities, especially metropolises, have to carefully conduct security surveillance.\nTo fight against the adversary, deploying a number of (video) cameras is a common surveillance approach, which has gained prominence in policy proposals on combating terrorism [1]. At first glance, camera placement is a trivial task that could be achieved by simply purchasing a huge number of cameras. However, subject to the economic budget, cameras cannot be placed unlimitedly. Additionally, as the camera resolution increases, the network bandwidth (and the storage and processing overhead) needed for real-time transmission of the recorded videos to the data center is considerably large. For example, the latest generation of IP cameras\n\u2217Corresponding author.\nrequire up to 10 Mbps bandwidth per camera [2]. Theses constraints will become more significant as cities grow in size and complexity.\nExploiting vehicle traffic from cyber transportation space to strategically place cameras could potentially facilitate physical-world security surveillance. For example, criminals and terrorists may drive vehicles before and after security events occur; vehicles have become terrorists\u2019 favorable weapons, such as the 2017 Westminster attack [3]. Thus, monitoring vehicles has great potential in collecting security event evidence.\nAs a straightforward strategy, one may place cameras in busy (e.g., more traffic) regions, where the adversary tends to commit crimes or large-scale threatening terrorism activities. However, this strategy may fail to cover vehicles that never enter busy regions. Intuitively, a good strategy should allow distinct vehicles visible to cameras as many as possible, and make each vehicle exposed to cameras frequently. The former requirement is very important because the invisibility of a vehicle to cameras means the lack of surveillance. The latter requirement encourages more information to be collected for each vehicle, making it more likely to recognize the trajectory of a vehicle.\nAfter placing the camera infrastructure, we also expect the placed cameras to be of high resolution for high-quality video data. However, as the number of placed cameras grows, the overhead of handling the data (e.g., transmission, storage and processing) may become intractable. That is, despite the large population of placed cameras, the number of cameras that could be of high resolution simultaneously is limited. Determining which cameras should be of high resolution is a nontrivial task. If a fixed set of cameras are configured as high resolution, the adversary may evade these cameras\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n08 50\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C Y\n] 1\nA pr\n(when committing crimes), thereby eliminating highquality crime evidence.\nFocusing on these problems, this article investigates vehicle traffic driven security camera infrastructure placement, and formulates it as a group of submodular set function optimization problems, which could be gracefully solved by the greedy algorithm with theoretical lower bounds. We propose five different placement strategies that differ in designing goals. Also, we design a randomized camera resolution upgrading framework based on game theory, with the purpose of breaching the practical overhead barrier of handing video data. Using the carefully designed randomized strategy, we can deter the sophisticated adversary with maximal utility.\nOur work constitutes the first effort toward building the linkage between vehicle traffic and security surveillance, which is a critical problem for smart cities. We expect our study could influence the decision making of surveillance camera placement, and foster more research efforts towards principled ways of security surveillance beneficial to our physical-world life.\nII. VEHICLE TRAFFIC DRIVEN PLACEMENT STRATEGIES FOR BUILDING SURVEILLANCE\nINFRASTRUCTURE"}, {"heading": "A. Problem Description", "text": "Let V be the set of vehicles under surveillance and v\u2208V be a vehicle. Suppose v is equipped with a position sensor. The coordinates include latitude and longitude. Specifically, the data from the sensor comprises the following fields: (vehicle ID, time, latitude, longitude), where the vehicle ID uniquely identifies a vehicle.\nThe metropolis is characterized as a rectangle uniquely identified by its maximum latitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude, and minimum longitude. The rectangle is divided into small blocks with a size of l\u00d7 l (e.g., 50m\u00d7 50m), resulting in a set of blocks denoted by \u2126. The advantages of dividing the map into blocks are two-fold, namely, map-independent (applicable for all metropolises) and exactly covering the entire map (unlike circulars).\nOur goal is to find a subset of blocks C \u2286\u2126 to place (super) cameras, so that the security surveillance utility could be maximized. The cardinality of C is the number of blocks that we select to place cameras. Let N denote the maximum number of blocks where we can afford to place cameras. Obviously, we have |C| \u2264 N. Note\nthat only a block with GPS records can be selected for camera placement, thereby containing at least one road."}, {"heading": "B. Placement Strategies", "text": "For all strategies, we denote the objective function by F(C). 1) S1\u2014Maximum Unique Vehicles: This strategy selects a subset C \u2286 \u2126 so that the number of unique vehicles crossing (at least one) blocks in C is maximized, formally expressed as\nargmax C F(C) = \u2211 v\u2208V Iv(C) (1)\nwhere Iv(C) equals one if v has crossed at least one block in C; otherwise Iv(C) equals 0. Such a strategy maximizes the visibility space (i.e., the total number of unique vehicles) of security surveillance.\n2) S2\u2014Maximum Vehicle Traffic: This strategy differs from S1 in that it maximizes the amount of vehicle traffic (rather than unique vehicles) crossing blocks in C. Similarly, it is\nargmax C F(C) = \u2211 v\u2208V Tv(C) (2)\nwhere Tv(C) denotes the amount of traffic of blocks in C contributed by v, and could be measured by the total time when v stays inside C. Tv(C) can be calculated by \u2211c\u2208C Tv(c), where Tv(c) denotes the total time when v stays in c, depending on the times when v enters and leaves c. S2 maximizes the total visible time to cameras of all vehicles (i.e., summing up the time each vehicle under surveillance).\n3) S3\u2014Minimum Mean OITR (Out-Camera to InCamera Time Ratio): This strategy minimizes the mean OITR across all vehicles. The OITR of a vehicle represents the proportion of time when a vehicle is outside the visible scope of cameras. Intuitively, smaller mean OITR across all vehicles indicates better security surveillance. S3 is equivalent to the maximization problem:\nargmax C F(C) = \u03a6\u2212\u2211 v\u2208V\n( S Tv(C)+1 \u22121 ) /|V | (3)\nwhere S is the measurement time. S3 does not take the uniqueness of cameras into consideration. Therefore, it encourages more unique vehicles visible to (whichever) cameras, and meanwhile each vehicle visible to cameras as long as possible. Note that Tv(C) is increased by one to avoid S being divided by zero, and \u03a6 is a constant derived from F( /0) = 0 so that we have F(C) \u2265 0. The same operation exists for S4 and S5.\n4) S4\u2014Minimum Mean ACIs (Average Camera-Hit Intervals): We define the ACIs to represent the average time interval to hit a camera for a vehicle. Formally, we minimize the mean ACIs across all vehicles, and S4 is equivalent to:\nargmax C F(C) = \u03a6\u2212\u2211 v\u2208V S Hv(C)+1 /|V | (4)\nwhere Hv(C) denotes the number of times that vehicle v hits (whichever) cameras along its trajectory during the measurement time S. S4 encourages more unique vehicles visible to (whichever) cameras, and meanwhile each vehicle to hit cameras more frequently.\n5) S5\u2014Minimum Mean AUIs (Average UniqueCamera-Hit Intervals): We further adapt S4 by considering the uniqueness of cameras that a vehicle hits. Accordingly, we define the AUIs to represent the average time interval to hit a new camera for a vehicle. Similar to S4, we minimize the mean AUIs across all vehicles, and S5 is defined as:\nargmax C F(C) = \u03a6\u2212\u2211 v\u2208V S Uv(C)+1 /|V | (5)\nwhere Uv(C) denotes the number of unique cameras that vehicle v hits during the measurement time S. Uv(C) is calculated as the number of unique blocks in C that v crosses. S5 encourages more unique vehicles visible to (whichever) cameras, and meanwhile each vehicle to hit more new cameras."}, {"heading": "C. Solving Optimal Placement Strategies", "text": "All the above strategies are formulated as maximization problems under the constraint |C| \u2264 N. To find a subset of blocks C \u2286 \u2126 to place cameras so that F(C) can be maximized, we need to solve these maximization problems, which are NP-hard.\nEach strategy differs in the objective function F(C). However, this does not necessarily mean that we have to solve these strategies in five different manners. Instead, all these maximization problems could be gracefully solved with a greedy algorithm (GA) because of their non-increasing monotony and submodularity [4,5]. The non-increasing monotony means that, for any two sets C1,C2 \u2286 \u2126 and C1 \u2286 C2, we have F(C1) \u2264 F(C2). Apparently, the functions defined in S1\u223cS5 are nondecreasing.\nThe submodularity means that a non-decreasing set function has the property of diminishing returns when a\nsingle element c is added to an input set C, as compared to c is added to an input set that is a subset of C. Specifically, for a non-decreasing function, such as F(C) defined in S1\u223cS5, given every two sets C1,C2 \u2286\u2126 and C1 \u2286 C2, and a new block c \u2208 \u2126 \\C2, the submodular property is equivalent to F(C1 \u222a {c})\u2212 F(C1) \u2265 F(C2\u222a{c})\u2212F(C2). This means smaller sets have more function value increment when they are added with a new block. It is easy to prove the the submodularity for S1 and S2. The proof of the submodularity for S3\u223cS5 is included in the appendix. Interested readers are referred to [5] for a comprehensive survey of submodularity.\nAccording to [4], submodularity allows us to derive a solution lower bounded by 1\u22121/e\u2248 63% of the optimal solution. GA runs for at most N rounds to obtain a set C of size |C| \u2264 N. In each round, it selects a new block c \u2208 \u2126 \\C maximizing the reward gain, \u03b4c(C) = F(C\u222a c)\u2212 F(C), and inserts c into C. This process repeats until |C|= N or \u03b4c(C) = 0.\nIII. RANDOMIZING CAMERA RESOLUTION UPGRADING FOR HIGH-QUALITY SURVEILLANCE\nAs the number of the affordable cameras grows, the overhead of handling the videos (e.g., transmission, storage and processing) may be impossible to satisfy, especially when high-resolution video is desired for high-quality crime evidence [6]. In other words, only a limited number of cameras could be of high resolution simultaneously.\nDetermining which cameras should be of high resolution is non-trivial. If a fixed set of cameras are configured as high resolution, the adversary may evade them deliberately (when committing crimes), thereby eliminating high-quality crime evidence. Therefore, we propose to randomly choose a set of placed cameras and upgrade their resolution, with an attempt to deter the adversary by making him feel that any camera might be of high resolution."}, {"heading": "A. A Game-theoretic Formulation", "text": "Since different blocks differ in their priorities to be monitored, or to be the target blocks where criminal activities are committed, we take into account the importance of different blocks when designing the randomized strategy. Meanwhile, the adversary aims to evade the surveillance of high-resolution cameras, while the defender (e.g., police) tries to observe the adversary.\nTo describe such confrontation, we leverage the Stackelberg security game (SSG) to design the strategy [7]. SSG is well-suited to adversarial reasoning for security resource allocation problems and has been adopted in many applications, such as US Federal Air Marshal Service [8].\nA standard SSG has two players, a leader and a follower. Each player has its own set of pure strategies to select. The leader and the follower act sequentially as follows. Step 1. The leader (i.e., defender) commits to a mixed strategy. The mixed strategy allows the leader to play a probability distribution over pure strategies, maximizing the leader\u2019s utility. Step 2. The follower (i.e., adversary), as a response, selects a pure strategy that optimizes his utility after inspecting and learning the mixed strategy chosen by the leader.\nWe consider a threat model wherein the adversary is sophisticated. Specifically, the adversary can inspect and learn the monitor\u2019s mixed strategy (i.e., the probability distribution), and select the pure strategy that maximizes his utility, i.e., a best response adversary.\nOn the other hand, the defender is forward-looking. That is, she takes into account the adversary\u2019s threat model when designing strategies, thereby making her strategy robust against the sophisticated adversary.\nAlthough the adversary can learn the defender\u2019s mixed strategy, he cannot predict which specific pure strategy the defender would adopt at the time of his scheduled criminal activities."}, {"heading": "B. Player Strategies", "text": "A pure strategy of the defender is a set of cameras whose resolution can be upgraded simultaneously. Our aim is to deter the adversary by randomly upgrading the resolution of the placed cameras, and thus the adversary committing crimes in blocks without cameras are not considered. Therefore, a pure strategy of the adversary is a set of blocks with placed cameras."}, {"heading": "C. Utility Functions", "text": "Consider that the adversary commits crimes in the ith block ci. If ci is covered by the defender\u2019s pure strategy, the defender receives reward Rdi . Otherwise, the defender receives penalty Pdi . Similarly, the adversary receives\npenalty Pai in the former case, and reward R a i in the latter case. The reward that the defender monitors a specific block can be assigned according to the importance of the block, such as the amount of vehicle traffic, the number of unique vehicles, and historical crime activity severity, and so forth. The penalty that the adversary selects a block can be measured in the same way.\nLet \u0393 j denote the jth defender pure strategy, and Ai j denotes the coverage indicator of \u0393 j on ci, where Ai j = 1 for ci \u2208 \u0393 j, and Ai j = 0 for ci /\u2208 \u0393 j.

Mixed Strategy against A Best Response Adversary", "text": "We formally define the objective function with constraints to maximize the defender\u2019s utility against a best response adversary.

The number of unique cameras v hits, calculated as \u2211c\u2208C Iv({c}), where Iv({c}) equals one if v hits c; otherwise zero.\n2) Result Analysis: For each strategy, we calculate UCR, VCR and VIT by varying the number of cameras N from 1 to 10,000. UCR and VCR reveal the proportion of unique vehicles and vehicle traffic that could be covered under each strategy, respectively. Additionally, we calculate VIT, VCH and VUH for each vehicle to have a closer look at the total amount time when a vehicle is under surveillance, the total number of cameras that a vehicle hits, and the total number of unique cameras that a vehicle hits, respectively.\nFig. 2 depicts the performance of all strategies. Generally, the metrics increase slower as N becomes larger, meaning that all strategies accomplish diminishing returns. Particularly, all metrics rise rapidly before N reaches 200, accounting for no more than 0.05% of all possible blocks where we can place cameras (i.e., R).\nAs Fig. 2a shows, a very small proportion of cameras need to be placed to cover the vast majority of vehicles. Specifically, all strategies exhibit a rapid rise in UCR to\nat least 90% before N reaches 200, indicating that we need to place cameras in no more than 0.05% blocks to cover at least 90% vehicles. Moreover, all strategies except S2 achieve a 100% UCR before N reaches 900 (i.e., 0.2% of R), while S2 almost has no increasing returns after N = 4,000.\nInsight 1. To cover all vehicles, we need to place cameras only in 0.2% blocks at most using S1, S3, S4, S5. Among these strategies capable of covering all vehicles, S1 could cover all vehicles with the smallest N (i.e., the most quickly), followed by S3, S4, and S5 in ascending order. However, S2 could hardly converge to cover all vehicles as N increases.\nThis insight reveals the existence of a small set of \u201ccore\u201d blocks covering all vehicles. Fig. 1a shows the minimum set of such \u201ccore\u201d blocks derived from strategy S1. Meanwhile, S2 that only maximizes vehicle traffic coverage results in slow or even incomplete vehicle coverage.\nFig. 2b demonstrates the vehicle traffic coverage ratio, where VCR rises roughly linearly as N increases for all strategies exclusive of S1. Among all strategies, S2 exhibits the largest growth rate, followed by S4, S3, S5, and S1. Fig. 1b shows top 563 blocks where we can place\ncameras to maximize VCR using S2. We observe that the blocks in Fig. 1b are significantly less geographically dispersed than those in Fig. 1a. The growth rates of S3 and S4 are comparable. S1 almost has no increasing returns after N = 200, implying that an emphasis on vehicle coverage may fail to maximize traffic coverage.\nInsight 2. Although S1 achieves the best performance regarding UCR, its performance regarding VCR degrades drastically to an extent where no increasing returns is accomplished when we invest more cameras after N = 200. In contrast, S3\u223cS5 achieve significant increasing returns regarding VCR as N increases. Although their increasing returns are not as fast as that of S2, they can converge to cover all vehicles quickly while S2 cannot.\nThis insight reveals that our proposed strategies S3\u223cS5 can achieve well-balanced performance between UCR and VCR. This is because they encourage more vehicles under surveillance while simultaneously considering more (unique) camera hits and traffic coverage per vehicle.\nFig. 2c presents mean VCH across all vehicles, which has similar trend as VCR. This reflects that the number of camera hits is positively correlated to in-camera time. For the same reason, VIT exhibits the same trend\nas VCH. We therefore omit the plot of mean VIT. Among all the strategies, S2 achieves the best average surveillance performance (i.e., longer in-camera time, more camera-hits) per vehicle, though it may result in slow or even incomplete vehicle coverage. Despite the performance degradation in mean VCH compared to S2, strategies S3\u223cS5 achieve median values of VIT and VCH across all vehicles comparable to S2, while simultaneously exhibiting much smaller standard deviation of VIT and VCH. Furthermore, the Gini coefficient of VCH for S2 is larger than that for S3\u223cS5, confirming that S3\u223cS5 achieve relatively fairer surveillance across all vehicles regarding in-camera time and camera hits than S2. Insight 3. S3\u223cS5 achieve more balanced surveillance across all vehicles in terms of in-camera time and camera hits than S2, avoiding little surveillance of some vehicles and too much surveillance (possibly unnecessary) of others. Therefore, they provide relatively fairer security surveillance services across all vehicles. Fig. 2d presents the performance of mean VUH (i.e., the number of unique vehicles that a vehicle hits) across all vehicles. We observe that S5 achieves the largest mean VUH, while S1 has no increasing returns after N\nreaches 200. The remaining strategies exhibit moderate performance worse than that of S5. Actually, S5 encourages deploying cameras in the blocks where different blocks along a vehicle\u2019s trajectory can be observed as many as possible, and meanwhile vehicles can be observed as many as possible. In this case, a vehicle is expected to be observed in more different blocks, thereby beneficial to capturing more places where a vehicle has ever been. This is important in security surveillance that prefers the knowledge on the places where a vehicle has been. Insight 4. S5 is a strategy in favor of capturing more places where a vehicle has ever been. Other strategies perform worse than S5 regarding mean VUH."}, {"heading": "C. A Case Study of Randomized Resolution Upgrading", "text": "To demonstrate the performance of randomized resolution upgrading based on game theory, we consider a security surveillance scenario where N = 10,000 cameras are placed while only 1,000 cameras could be of high resolution. Suppose the surveillance focuses on criminal (or terrorist) activities that tend to be conducted at places that are generally with more vehicle traffic (so to make more serious consequences). We thus measure the importance of a block ci according to its amount of traffic in the dataset, which is calculated as T (ci) =\u2211v\u2208V Tv({ci}).\nWe consider that the defender and the adversary play a zero-sum game. That is, each player\u2019s gain (or loss) of utility is exactly balanced by the losses (or gains) of the utility of the other player(s). Formally, we set Rdi +P a i = 0, R a i +P d i = 0. Obviously, we have Ud + Ua = 0. Meanwhile, the importance values of blocks are normalized through dividing each value by the maximum value. Therefore, we have Rdi ,R a i \u2208 [0,1], and Pdi ,P a i \u2208 [\u22121,0]. Combining (8), (9), (11), and (12), it is easy to know Ua,Ud \u2208 [\u22121,1]. Before realizing randomized resolution upgrading, we randomly generate 1,000 defender pure strategies in total. The union of these pure strategies cover all the placed cameras to ensure that the resolution of any camera has a chance to be upgraded. On the other hand, an adversary pure strategy is a block where he commits crimes, the number of which equals 10,000.\nTable I shows the defender utility (i.e., Ud) when the defender adopts the mixed strategy, in comparison to adopting two baseline defender strategies, namely, uniform strategy and best strategy. The uniform strategy means the defender adopts a pure strategy uniformly\nat random. The best strategy allows the defender to constantly adopt the pure strategy that contains the most important block. If there are multiple such pure strategies, the defender selects the one maximizing her utility.\nFrom the table, we see that the mixed strategy achieves significantly larger utility than the baseline strategies, no matter which placement strategy (S1\u223c S5) is employed to place the camera infrastructure. Such a result indicates that, once the importance of each block is defined, one can derive the mixed strategy that outperforms baseline strategies and maximizes the defender utility against a sophisticated adversary. This case study implies the feasibility that the security police randomly selects a set of cameras and upgrades their resolution for highquality video evidence based on the proposed security game model."}, {"heading": "V. DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"heading": "A. Customizing Security Surveillance", "text": "Different types of vehicles may require different surveillance priorities. For example, compared with individual cars, taxis (as a public space) and school buses usually need higher surveillance priorities. Although we do not distinguish between different vehicle types, every vehicle v can be assigned a personalized weight wv indicating its surveillance priority, where larger values of the weight indicate higher surveillance priorities. One can also assign weights to vehicles according to their reputation scores derived from social data like accident records and vehicle owners\u2019 criminal records. Vehicles with more accident records, or whose owners have more criminal records, would be assigned higher weights.\nThe weight wv can be directly used as a multiplier of the parameters in the proposed strategies. For example, Iv(C) could be replaced by wvIv(C), and so do Tv(C), Hv(C) and Uv(C). This keeps the non-decreasing submodular property of F(C). Therefore, GA remains applicable. By incorporating individual vehicle information, we can customize placement strategies as needed, with a bias toward vehicles with higher surveillance priorities and lower reputation scores."}, {"heading": "B. Privacy Issues", "text": "Determining strategies for customizing security surveillance not only anticipates GPS data sharing from vehicles, but also rely on other social data sources\nhelpful to security surveillance. The data sharing may introduce privacy issues, which however could be resolved by data obfuscation techniques (e.g., obfuscating vehicle IDs). Whenever a security event occurs, the obfuscated data (e.g., vehicles IDs) would again be recovered from collected (video) data recorded by cameras using plate number recognition techniques, after being authorized by privileged authorities. Additionally, tracking individual vehicles by cameras may also have privacy issues. Thus, we suggest the public should be notified of placed cameras, and meanwhile the collected video data MUST be strictly managed by authorities according to law.\nVI. RELATED WORK\nTransportation Monitoring. Transportation monitoring is a broad area closely related to urban computing tasks like energy and transportation optimization (e.g., ridesharing, speed control), road traffic monitoring (e.g., travel time estimation), urban environment modeling (e.g., PM 2.5 air quality) [11]. Transportation monitoring undoubtedly accelerates the operation efficiency of a metropolis. However, none of the existing studies regarding transportation monitoring exploits vehicle traffic to select camera placement blocks in favor of security surveillance. Physical-World Security Surveillance. Recent years have witnessed a rising trend towards game-theoretic urban security patrolling on roads [12]. Specifically, an adversary assigns different values to reaching (and damaging or destroying) one of multiple targets (e.g., buildings). A defender can allocate resources to capture the attacker before he reaches a target. To prevent attacks, security forces can schedule checkpoints on roads to detect adversaries. Different from these studies, we leverage game theory to control placed cameras. Moreover, camera placement complements road patrolling,\nbecause the adversaries missed by the road checkpoints could be further inspected by placed cameras.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nThis article explored the linkage between vehicle traffic and camera placement in favor of security surveillance from a network perspective. We proposed different camera placement strategies that facilitate security surveillance. Using real-world data from a metropolis, we demonstrated that the proposed strategies could facilitate metropolis security surveillance in different aspects. We also studied the security surveillance problem that high-resolution video is desired for high-quality crime evidence, while only a limited number of placed cameras can be of high resolution simultaneously based on game theory. The results illustrated that, using the carefully designed randomized strategy, we can deter a sophisticated adversary with maximal utility under the constraint of practical overhead.\nTo make our cities safer, there remain a lot of problems to explore. In an era of mass terrorism, we expect our work could stimulate more research on transportation data-driven security surveillance in smart cities."}], "references": [{"title": "Is camera surveillance an effective measure of counterterrorism", "author": ["Alois Stutzer", "Michael Zehnder"], "venue": "Defence and Peace Economics,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2013}, {"title": "An analysis of approximations for maximizing submodular set functionsI", "author": ["G.L.
