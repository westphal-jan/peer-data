Fuzzy logic bridges from mathematics to the way humans reason and the way the human world operates. Clearly, the \"class of all real numbers which are much greater than 1,\" or \"the class of beautiful women,\" or \"the class of tall men,\" do not constitute classes or sets in the usual mathematical sense of these terms. Yet, \u201cthe fact remains that such imprecisely defined notions play an important role in human thinking, particularly in the domains of decisionmaking, abstraction and communication of information\u201d [Zadeh, 1965]. According to [Meyer, Zimmerman, 2011], few works exist in business intelligence that use fuzzy logic due to certain inherent difficulties of creating such applications, and yet; despite them, such applications are possible and very useful. The difficulties are as follows. Firstly, many applications do not permit a trial and error calibration, because the results of a fuzzy model cannot easily be compared to the results of the behaviour of the real system. Secondly, the operators, membership functions, and inference methods have to properly map the counterparts of human mind, in which they are very\noften very context dependent. Thirdly, this is no longer a mathematical problem but predominantly a problem of psycholinguistics or similar disciplines, and unlikely this part of science is much less developed than the mathematics of fuzzy set theory. The main two types of fuzzy technology are fuzzy knowledge based systems, e.g. [Meyer, Zimmerman, 2011] and fuzzy clustering e.g. [Tettamanzi et al, 2007].\nOur idea is different from the above. Fuzzy logic enables us to formulate a natural language interface between big data, numeric analytics, and a manager, hiding the compexity of data and methods. We summarize data using linguistic hedges and formulating queries in a natural language. Our specific application is targeting different user segments to fill in the spare capacity of the network in a network-friendly manner. In [Sidorova et al, 2017], the notion of Infrastructure-Stressing (IS) Client was proposed together with the method to reveal such clients from the customer base. Informally, IS clients use the infrastructure in a stressing manner, such as always staying in the zones of high demand, where the antennas are prone to service failures, if further loaded. Being IS is not only a function of user\u2019s qualities, but also of the infrastructure, and of the relative mobility of the rest of the population. It is not possible to directly use this knowledge in marketing campaigns, where the desired action is to avoid recruiting IS clients, at least recruiting them in disproportionally large quantities. This paper aims to make the knowledge about IS users applicable in marketing.\nFor marketing campaigns geodemographic segmenations (like ACORN or MOSAIC) are used, since it is known how the segments can be targeted to achieve the desired goal, as for example, the promotion of a new mobile service in certain neigbourhoods. The client\u2019s home address determines the geodemographic category. People of similar social status and lifestyle tend to live close. Compared to conventional occupational measures of social class, postcode classifications typically achieve higher levels of discrimination, whether averaged across a random basket of behaviors recorded on the Target Group Index or surveys of citizen satisfaction with the provision of local authority services. One of the reasons that segmentation systems like MOSAIC are so effective is\nthat they are created by combining statistical averages for both census data and consumer spending data in predefined geographical units [Grubesic, 2004]. The postcode descriptors allow us powerful means to unravel lifestyle differences in ways that are difficult to distinguish using conventional survey research given limited sources and sample size constraints [Webber and Butler, 2007]. For example, it was demonstrated that middle-class MOSAIC categories in the UK such as \u2018New Urban Colonists\u2019, \u2018Bungalow Retirement\u2019, \u2018Gentrified Villages\u2019 and \u2018Conservative Values\u2019, whilst very similar in terms of overall social status, nonetheless register widely different public attitudes and voting intentions, show support for different kinds of charities and preferences for different media as well as different forms of consumption. Geodemographic categories correlate to diabetes propensity [Levy, 2006], school students\u2019 performance [Webber and Butler, 2007], broadband access and availability [Grubesic, 2004] and so on. Industries rely increasingly on geodemographic segmentation to classify their markets when acquiring new customers [Haenlein and Kaplan, 2009]. The localized versions of MOSAIC have been developed for a number of countries, including the USA and most of the EU countries. The main geodemographic systems are in competition with each other and the exact details of the data and methods for generating lifestyles segments are never released [Debenham et al., 2003] and, as a result, the specific variables or the derivations of these variables are unknown. To conclude, geodemographic segmentation provides a collective view point, where the client is seen as a representative of the population who live nearby. However, in recent research, it has been shown that the problem of resource allocation in the zones with nearly overloaded and underloaded antennas is better handled relying on individual modelling based on client\u2019s historical trajectories [Sagar, 2016]. The author completed a user segmentation based on clustering of user trajectories and demonstrated that network planning is more effective, if trajectory-based segments are used instead of MOSAIC segments. Our aim is to explore the ways to connect the individual trajectory-based view of IS customers and the geo-demographic view in order to devise analytics capable to complete the efficient analysis based on the individual view point and yet be useful in marketing campaigns in which geodemographic groups are targeted. As a practical conclusion, we have compiled a ranked list of the segments according to their propensity to contain IS clients (expressed as a fuzzy notion) and crafted two queries:\n1. Which segments are more or less devoid of IS clients? (attract them, while the infrastructure is still rather underloaded) 2. Which segment is highly devoid of IS clients? (when the custormer base becomes mature and\nthe infrastructure becomes increasingly loaded).\nThe contributions of this paper are as follows. Firstly, we have studied the correlation between IS users and the MOSAIC segments. For different contexts, we have completed candidate rankings of geodemographic segments, and, given an absense of other preferences, the top-tier segments are preferable. Which ranking out of several candidate ones is taken depends on the hedge (degree) calculated for the intensity of infrastructure exploitation. Secondly, the verification/simulation of the resulting fuzzy recommendations guarantees the absense of false negatives, such as, concluding that certain segments can be hired from, but in fact that would lead to a service failure at some place in the network. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the data set. In Section 3 the proposed methodology is explained. In Section 4, experiments are reported, and finally the conclusions are drawn and discussion is held in Section 5."}, {"heading": "2 Data Set", "text": "The study has been conducted on anonymized geospatial and geo-demographic data provided by a Scandinavian telecommunication operator. The data consist of CDRs (Call Detail Records) containing historical location data and calls made during one week in a midsized region in Sweden with more than one thousand radio cells. Several cells can be located on the same antenna. The cell density varies in different areas and is higher in city centers, compared to rural areas. The locations of 27010 clients are registered together with which cell serves the client. The location is registered every five minutes. In the periods when the client does not generate any traffic, she does not make any impact on the infrastructure and such periods of inactivity are not included in the resource allocation analysis. Every client in the database is labeled with her MOSAIC segment. The fields of the database used in this study are: \u2022 the cells IDs with the information about which a user it\nserved at different time points, \u2022 the location coordinates of the cells, \u2022 the time stamps of every event (5 minute resolution), \u2022 the MOSAIC geodemographic segment for each client,\nand \u2022 the Telenor geodemographic segment for each client.\nThere are 14 MOSAIC segments present in the database; for their detailed description the reader is refferred to [InsightOne]. The six in-house Telenor segments were developed by Telenor in collaboration with InsightOne, and, to our best knowledge, though not conceptually different from MOSAIC, they are especially crafted for telecommunication businesses."}, {"heading": "3 A Link between IS and Geo-demographic Segments", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Notation and Definitions", "text": "Definition (in the style of [Zadeh, 1965]). A fuzzy set A in X is characterized by a membership function fA(x), which associates with each point in X a real number in the interval [0, 1], with the value of fA(x) at x representing the \"grade of membership\" of x in A. For the opposite quality: fnotA(x) = 1- fA(x). Fuzzy membership scores reflect the varying degree to which different cases belong to a set:\n\u2022 Under the six value fuzzy set, there are six tiers of membership 1: fully in, 0.9: mostly but not fully in, 0.6: more or less in, 0.4: more or less out, 0.1: mostly but not fully out, 0: fully out.\n\u2022 Thus, fuzzy sets combine qualitative and quantitative assessment: 1 and 0 are qualitative assignments (\u201cfully in\u201d and \u201cfully out\u201d, respectively); values between 0 and 1 indicate parcial membership. The 0.5 score is also qualitatively anchored, for it indicates the point of maximum ambiguity (fuzziness) in the assessment of whether a case is more \u201cin\u201d or \u201cout\u201d of a set. For a comprehensive guide of good practices in fuzzy logic analysis in social sciences the reader is refferred to, for example, [Ragin, 2009]. Interpretation:\n\u2022 Rather will be added to a quality A, if the square root of its membership function fA(x)1/2 is close to 1. \u2022 Very will be added to a quality A, if the square of its membership function fA(x)2 is close to 1. \u2022 Extremely will be added to a quality A, if fA(x)3 is close to 1. The interpretation follows from the application of the hedge operator, which adds the quantifiers such as very, rather, extremely, to the membership function, for example fveryA(x)= fA(x)2 [Zadeh, 1972]. Then, given the new membership function, the same principle applies: the closer to 1, the higher is the degree of membership. Inside a tier, the hedged membership functions obey an inclusion relation: extremely f \u2282 very f \u2282 rather f."}, {"heading": "3.2 Query Formulation", "text": "As mentioned above, within the same geo-demographic segment, the clients differ with respect to being IS or not. When the infrastructure is not overloaded, that is, the recent historical load is still significantly smaller than the capacity, then virtually any client is welcome. The following two queries are formulated reflecting the desire to apply context-dependent strategies. As the infrastructure becomes more loaded, the operator wants to be more discriminative with respect to the degree of the\nIS/IF quality. In its turn, \u201cloaded\u201d for an antenna is naturally formulated as a fuzzy variable: floaded(antenna j)=max all t {load(j,t) capacity(antenna j)-1}. The floaded(antenna j) is calculated in man units. The load in the analyzed zone is set to the maximum peak of demand registered:\nfloaded(infrastructure)=maxall antennas j { floaded(antenna j)}.\nQueries: \u2022 Which segments to target, provided that rather IF\nare acceptable clientele? \u2022 Which segments to target, provided that only very\nIF are wanted? Depending on the load, different rankings of segments become available. If initially some segments were in the same tier, for example, very IF segments, some of them fall out of the tier, as the hedge operator is applied and the value of the membership function is squared (for extremely IF). The context, when to apply Query 1 or 2, becomes clarified comparing the network load (measured as network peak load) to network capacity. The method to obtain fuzzy heuristics is summarized to the sequence of the following steps, depicted as a flow chart in Figure 1, and formalized as Algorithm 1.\nStep 1: The IS clients in the customer base are revealed with the method [Sidorova et al, 2017] (the algorithm is\nreproduced as the function reveal_IS clients in the Algorithm 1), and each client is labeled with the IS/notIS descriptor. Step 2: The propensity of a segment to contain IS clients is defined as the frequency of IS clients among its members and it is calculated from the data: fIS(segmenti)= frequencyIS(segmenti). Infrastructure-Friendly (IF) is set to: fIF(segmenti)=1- fIS(segmenti). Step 3: The ranking of segments is carried out with respect to their IF quality: for all segments i, frather IF(segmenti), fvery IF(segmenti), and fextremely IF(segmenti). Within a context, the segments fall into the different tiers (corresponding to one of the fuzzy values): \u201cfully in\u201d, \u201cmostly but not fully in\u201d, \u201cmore or less in\u201d, and so on. Step 4: Locally for the region under analysis, the infrastructure is assessed as loaded, very loaded, and extremely loaded, in order to map the context into a corresponding hedge. Among several candidate rankings, the one for a corresponding hedge is selected (as a leap of faith further verified in the next section).

It does not necessary hold, since the calibration of fuzzy functions depend on the expected outcome of the campaign and the consequent effect on the infrastructure. For example, the campaign can attract 300 new clients or 1500 new clients. To avoid false negatives, the fuzzy heuristic is subjected to a validation procedure, which simulates the impact of the expected result on the infrastructure. I.
