First detailed as a technique for restoring degraded images [GG84], Gibbs sampling has since found diverse applications in statistical physics [Jan08], stochastic optimization and parameter estimation [Gey91], and Bayesian inference [Lun+00].\nThe hallmark of any Gibbs sampler is conditional simulation: individual variables are successively simulated from the univariate conditionals of a multivariate target distribution. The principal degree of freedom is the scan, the order in which variables are sampled [He+16]. While it is common to employ a systematic scan, sweeping through each variable in turn, or a uniform random scan, sampling each variable with equal frequency, it is known that non-uniform scans can lead to more accurate inferences both in theory and in practice [LWK95; LC06]. This effect is particularly pronounced when certain variables are of greater inferential interest. Past approaches to optimizing Gibbs sampler scans were based on asymptotic quality measures approximated with the output of a Markov chain [Lev+05; LC06].\nIn this work, we propose a computable non-asymptotic scan quality measure for discrete target distributions based on Dobrushin\u2019s notion of variable influence [DS85]. We show that for a given subset of variables, this Dobrushin variation (DV) bounds the marginal total variation between a target distribution and T steps of Gibbs sampling with a specified scan. More generally, Dobrushin variation bounds a weighted total variation based on user-inputted importance weights for each variable. We couple this quality measure with an efficient procedure for optimizing scan quality by minimizing Dobrushin variation. Our Dobrushin-optimized Gibbs samplers (DoGS) come equipped with a guaranteed bound on scan quality, are never worse than the standard\nar X\niv :1\n70 7.\n05 80\n7v 1\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n1 8\nJu l 2\nuniform random and systematic scans, and can be tailored to a target number of sampling steps and a subset of target variables. Moreover, Dobrushin variation can be used to evaluate and compare the quality of any user-specified set of scans prior to running any expensive simulations.\nThe improvements achieved by DoGS are driven by an inputted matrix, C\u0304, of pairwise variable influence bounds discussed in more detail in Section 3. While DoGS can be used with any discrete distribution, it was designed for targets with total influence \u2016C\u0304\u2016 < 1, measured in any matrix norm. This criterion is known to hold for a variety of distributions, including Ising models with sufficiently high temperatures, hard-core lattice gas models, random graph colorings [Hay06], and classes of weighted constraint satisfaction problems [FSY17]. Moreover, as we will see in Section 4.1, suitable variable influence bounds are readily available for pairwise and binary Markov random fields. These user-friendly bounds give rise to total influence \u2016C\u0304\u2016 < 1 in all of our experiments and thereby enable improvements in both inferential speed and accuracy over standard scans.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews Gibbs sampling and standard but computationally intractable measures of Gibbs sampler quality. In Section 3, we introduce our scan quality measure and its relationship to (weighted) total variation. We describe our procedures for selecting high-quality Gibbs sampler scans in Section 4. In Section 5, we apply our techniques to three popular applications of the Gibbs sampler: joint image segmentation and object recognition, MCMC maximum likelihood estimation with intractable gradients, and inference in the Ising model. In each case, we observe substantial improvements in full or marginal total variation over standard scans. Section 6 presents our conclusions and discussion of future work.\nNotation For any vector v and index i, we let v\u2212i represent the subvector of v with entry vi removed. We use diag(v) for a square diagonal matrix with v on the diagonal and for element-wise multiplication.

For example, when modeling a large particle system, we may be interested principally in the behavior in local region of the system; likewise, when segmenting an image into its component parts, a particular region, like the area surrounding a face, is often of primary interest. In these cases, it is more natural to consider a marginal total variation that measures the discrepancy in expectation over only those variables of interest.\nDefinition 2 (Marginal total variation). The marginal total variation between probability measures \u00b5 and \u03bd on a subset of variables S \u2208 [p] is the maximum difference in expectations over all [0, 1]-valued functions of X \u2223\u2223 S , the restriction of X to the coordinates in S:\n\u2016\u00b5\u2212 \u03bd\u2016S,TV , sup f :X |S|\u2192[0,1] \u2223\u2223\u2223E\u00b5[f(X\u2223\u2223S)]\u2212 E\u03bd[f(Y \u2223\u2223S)]\u2223\u2223\u2223. More generally, we will seek to control an arbitrary user-defined weighted total variation that assigns an independent non-negative weight to each variable and hence controls the approximation error for functions with varying sensitivities in each variable.\nDefinition 3 (d-bounded differences).

This definition leads to a measure of sample quality tailored to d-bounded difference functions.\nDefinition 4 (d-weighted total variation).

Our construction is inspired by the Gibbs sampler convergence analysis of Dobrushin and Shlosman [DS85].\nThe first step in Dobrushin\u2019s approach is to control total variation in terms of coupled random vectors, (Xt, Yt) T t=0, where X\nt has the distribution, \u03c0t, of the t-th step of the Gibbs sampler and Y t follows the target distribution \u03c0. For any such coupling, we can define the marginal coupling probability pt,i , P(Xti 6= Y ti ). The following lemma, a generalization of results in [DS85; Hay06], shows that weighted total variation is controlled by these marginal coupling probabilities. The proof is given in Appendix A.1, and similar arguments can be found in Rebeschini and Handel [RH14].\nLemma 5 (Marginal coupling controls weighted TV).

The Dobrushin influence of variable j on variable i is given by\nCij , max (X,Y )\u2208Nj\n\u2016\u03c0(\u00b7|X\u2212i)\u2212 \u03c0(\u00b7|Y\u2212i)\u2016TV (1)\nwhere (X,Y ) \u2208 Nj signifies Xl = Yl for all l 6= j. This influence matrix is at the heart of our efficiently computable measure of scan quality, Dobrushin variation.\nDefinition 7 (Dobrushin variation). For any nonnegative weight vector d \u2208 Rp and entrywise upper bound C\u0304 on the Dobrushin influence (1), we define the Dobrushin variation of a scan (qt)Tt=1 as V(q1, . . . , qT ; d, C\u0304) , d>B(qT ) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7B(q1)1 for B(q) , (I \u2212 diag(q)(I \u2212 C\u0304)).\nTheorem 8 shows that Dobrushin variation dominates weighted TV and thereby provides target- and scan-specific guarantees on the weighted TV quality of a Gibbs sampler.

We will refer to the resulting customized Gibbs samplers as Dobrushin-optimized Gibbs samplers or DoGS for short. Algorithm 2 optimizes Dobrushin variation using coordinate descent, with the selection distribution qt for each time step serving as a coordinate. Since Dobrushin variation is linear in each qt, each coordinate optimization (in the absence of ties) selects a degenerate distribution, a single coordinate, yielding a fully deterministic scan. If m \u2264 p is a bound on the size of the Markov blanket of each variable, then our forward-backward algorithm runs in time O(\u2016d\u20160 +min(m log p+m2, p)T ) with O(p+T ) storage for deterministic input scans. The T (m log p+m2) term arises from maintaining the derivative vector, w, in an efficient sorting structure, like a max-heap.\nA user can initialize DoGS with any baseline scan, including a systematic or uniform random scan, and the resulting customized scan is guaranteed to have the same or better Dobrushin variation.

However, as noted in their Rem. 5.13, no explicit scan selection rules were provided in that paper. The only prior concrete scan selection rules of which we are aware are the Minimax Adaptive Scans with asymptotic variance or convergence rate objective functions [LC06]. Unless some substantial approximation is made, it is unclear how to implement these procedures when the target distribution of interest is not Gaussian.\nLevine and Casella [LC06] approximate these Minimax Adaptive Scans for specific mixture models by considering single ad hoc features of interest; the approach has many hyperparameters to tune including the order of the Taylor expansion approximation, which sample points are used to approximate asymptotic quantities online, and the frequency of adaptive updating. Our proposed quality measure, Dobrushin variation, requires no approximation or tuning and can be viewed as a practical non-asymptotic objective function for the abstract scan selection framework of Levine and Casella. In the spirit of [LJHG11], DoGS can also be viewed as an approximate inference scheme calibrated for downstream inferential tasks depending only on subsets of variables.\nLevine et al. [Lev+05] employ the Minimax Adaptive Scans of Levine and Casella by finding the mode of their target distribution using EM and then approximating the distribution by a Gaussian. They report that this approach to scan selection introduces substantial computational overhead (10 minutes of computation for an Ising model with 64 variables).

We see that the systematic scan, which traverses variables in row major order, obtains a significantly better TV guarantee than its uniform random counterpart for all sampling budgets T . Hence, the systematic scan would be our standard scan of choice for this target. DoGS (Algorithm 2) initialized with d = 1 and the systematic scan further improves the systematic scan guarantee by two orders of magnitude. Iterating Algorithm 2 on its own scan output until convergence (\u201cIterated DoGS\u201d in Figure 1) provides additional improvement.

We target a single marginal X1 with d = e1 and take a systematic scan of length T = 2\u00d7 106 as our input scan. After measuring the Dobrushin variation of the systematic scan, we use an efficient length-doubling scheme to select a DoGS scan: (0) initialize T\u0303 = 2; (1) run Algorithm 2 with the first T\u0303 steps of the systematic scan as input; (2) if the resulting DoGS scan has Dobrushin variation less than , we keep it; otherwise we double T\u0303 and return to step (1). The resulting DoGS scan has length T\u0303 = 16.\nWe repeatedly draw independent sample points from either the length T systematic scan Gibbs sampler or the length T\u0303 DoGS scan Gibbs sampler.

In this work, we use Dobrushin influence as the basis of a practical tool to certify and efficiently improve the quality of a discrete Gibbs sampler. Our Dobrushin-optimized Gibbs samplers (DoGS) offer customized variable selection orders for a given sampling budget and variable subset of interest, explicit bounds on total variation distance to stationarity, and certifiable improvements over the standard systematic and uniform random scan Gibbs samplers. In our experiments with joint image segmentation and object recognition, Markov chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation, and Ising model inference, DoGS consistently deliver higher-quality inferences with significantly smaller sampling budgets than standard Gibbs samplers.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
