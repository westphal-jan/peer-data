It is an asymmetric relation between two terms, a hypernym (superordinate) and a hyponym (subordiate), as in animal\u2013bird and flower\u2013rose, where the hyponym necessarily implies the hypernym, but not vice versa. From a computational point of view, automatic hypernymy detection is useful for NLP tasks such as taxonomy creation (Snow et al., 2006; Navigli et al., 2011), recognizing textual entailment (Dagan et al., 2013), and text generation (Biran and McKeown, 2013), among many others.\nTwo families of approaches to identify and discriminate hypernyms are predominent in NLP, both of them relying on word vector representa-\ntions. Distributional count approaches make use of either directionally unsupervised measures or of supervised classification methods. Unsupervised measures exploit the distributional inclusion hypothesis (Geffet and Dagan, 2005; ZhitomirskyGeffet and Dagan, 2009), or the distributional informativeness hypothesis (Santus et al., 2014; Rimell, 2014). These measures assign scores to semantic relation pairs, and hypernymy scores are expected to be higher than those of other relation pairs. Typically, Average Precision (AP) (Kotlerman et al., 2010) is applied to rank and distinguish between the predicted relations. Supervised classification methods represent each pair of words as a single vector, by using the concatenation or the element-wise difference of their vectors (Baroni et al., 2012; Roller et al., 2014; Weeds et al., 2014). The resulting vector is fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) or into Logistic Regression (LR), to predict hypernymy. Across approaches, Shwartz et al. (2017) demonstrated that there is no single unsupervised measure which consistently deals well with discriminating hypernymy from other semantic relations. Furthermore, Levy et al. (2015) showed that supervised methods memorize prototypical hypernyms instead of learning a relation between two words.\nApproaches of hypernymy-specific embeddings utilize neural models to learn vector representations for hypernymy. Yu et al. (2015) proposed a supervised method to learn term embeddings for hypernymy identification, based on pre-extracted hypernymy pairs. Recently, Tuan et al. (2016) proposed a dynamic weighting neural model to learn term embeddings in which the model encodes not only the information of hypernyms vs. hyponyms, but also their contextual information. The performance of this family of models is typically evaluated by using an SVM to discriminate hypernymy from other relations.\nar X\niv :1\n70 7.\n07 27\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n3 Ju\nl 2 01\n7\nIn this paper, we propose a novel neural model HyperVec to learn hierarchical embeddings that (i) discriminate hypernymy from other relations (detection task), and (ii) distinguish between the hypernym and the hyponym in a given hypernymy relation pair (directionality task). Our model learns to strengthen the distributional similarity of hypernym pairs in comparison to other relation pairs, by moving hyponym and hypernym vectors close to each other. In addition, we generate a distributional hierarchy between hyponyms and hypernyms. Relying on these two new aspects of hypernymy distributions, the similarity of hypernym pairs receives higher scores than the similarity of other relation pairs; and the distributional hierarchy of hyponyms and hypernyms indicates the directionality of hypernymy.\nOur model is inspired by the distributional inclusion hypothesis, that prominent context words of hyponyms are expected to appear in a subset of the hypernym contexts. We assume that each context word which appears with both a hyponym and its hypernym can be used as an indicator to determine which of the two words is semantically more general: Common context word vectors which represent distinctive characteristics of a hyponym are expected to be closer to the hyponym vector than to its hypernym vector. For example, the context word flap is more characteristic for a bird than for its hypernym animal; hence, the vector of flap should be closer to the vector of bird than to the vector of animal.\nWe evaluate our HyperVec model on both unsupervised and supervised hypernymy detection and directionality tasks. In addition, we apply the model to the task of graded lexical entailment (Vulic\u0301 et al., 2016), and we assess the capability of HyperVec on generalizing hypernymy by mapping to German and Italian. Results on benchmark datasets of hypernymy show that the hierarchical embeddings outperform state-of-the-art measures and previous embedding models. Furthermore, the implementation of our models is made publicly available.1"}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Unsupervised hypernymy measures: A variety of directional measures for unsupervised hypernymy detection (Weeds and Weir, 2003; Weeds et al., 2004; Clarke, 2009; Kotlerman et al., 2010;\n1 www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/data/hypervec\nLenci and Benotto, 2012) all rely on some variation of the distributional inclusion hypothesis: If u is a semantically narrower term than v, then a significant number of salient distributional features of u is expected to be included in the feature vector of v as well. In addition, Santus et al. (2014) proposed the distributional informativeness hypothesis, that hypernyms tend to be less informative than hyponyms, and that they occur in more general contexts than their hyponyms. All of these approaches represent words as vectors in distributional semantic models (Turney and Pantel, 2010), relying on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954; Firth, 1957). For evaluation, these directional models use the AP measure to assess the proportion of hypernyms at the top of a score-sorted list. In a different vein, Kiela et al. (2015) introduced three unsupervised methods drawn from visual properties of images to determine a concept\u2019s generality in hypernymy tasks.\nSupervised hypernymy methods: The studies in this area are based on word embeddings which represent words as low-dimensional and realvalued vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Pennington et al., 2014). Each hypernymy pair is encoded by some combination of the two word vectors, such as concatenation (Baroni et al., 2012) or difference (Roller et al., 2014; Weeds et al., 2014). Hypernymy is distinguished from other relations by using a classification approach, such as SVM or LR. Because word embeddings are trained for similar and symmetric vectors, it is however unclear whether the supervised methods do actually learn the asymmetry in hypernymy (Levy et al., 2015).\nHypernymy-specific embeddings: These approaches are closest to our work. Yu et al. (2015) proposed a dynamic distance-margin model to learn term embeddings that capture properties of hypernymy. The neural model is trained on the taxonomic relation data which is pre-extracted. The resulting term embeddings are fed to an SVM classifier to predict hypernymy. However, this model only learns term pairs without considering their contexts, leading to a lack of generalization for term embeddings. Tuan et al. (2016) introduced a dynamic weighting neural network to learn term embeddings that encode information about hypernymy and also about their contexts, considering all words between a hypernym and its\nhyponym in a sentence. The proposed model is trained on a set of hypernym relations extracted from WordNet (Miller, 1995). The embeddings are applied as features to detect hypernymy, using an SVM classifier. Tuan et al. (2016) handles the drawback of the approach by Yu et al. (2015), considering the contextual information between two terms; however the method still is not able to determine the directionality of a hypernym pair. Vendrov et al. (2016) proposed a method to encode order into learned distributed representations, to explicitly model partial order structure of the visual-semantic hierarchy or the hierarchy of hypernymy in WordNet. The resulting vectors are used to predict the transitive hypernym relations in WordNet."}, {"heading": "3 Hierarchical Embeddings", "text": "In this section, we present our model of hierarchical embeddings HyperVec.

We rely on WordNet, a large lexical database of English (Fellbaum, 1998), and extract all hypernym\u2013hyponym pairs for nouns and for verbs, including both direct and indirect hypernymy, e.g., animal\u2013bird, bird\u2013 robin, animal\u2013robin. Before training our model, we exclude all hypernym pairs which appear in any datasets used for evaluation.\nIn the following, Section 3.1.1 first describes the Skip-gram model which is integrated into our model for optimization. Section 3.1.2 then describes the objective functions to train the hierarchical embeddings for hypernymy."}, {"heading": "3.1.1 Skip-gram Model", "text": "The Skip-gram model is a word embeddings method suggested by Mikolov et al. (2013b). Levy and Goldberg (2014) introduced a variant of the Skip-gram model with negative sampling (SGNS), in which the objective function is defined as follows:\nJSGNS = \u2211\nw\u2208VW \u2211 c\u2208VC J(w,c) (1)\nJ(w,c) = #(w, c) log \u03c3(~w,~c)\n+ k \u00b7 EcN\u223cPD [log \u03c3(\u2212~w,~cN )] (2)\nwhere the skip-gram with negative sampling is trained on a corpus of words w \u2208 VW and their contexts c \u2208 VC , with VW and VC the word and context vocabularies, respectively. The collection of observed words and context pairs is denoted as D; the term #(w, c) refers to the number of times the pair (w, c) appeared in D; the term \u03c3(x) is the sigmoid function; the term k is the number of negative samples and the term cN is the sampled context, drawn according to the empirical unigram distribution P ."}, {"heading": "3.1.2 Hierarchical Hypernymy Model", "text": "Vector representations for detecting hypernymy are usually encoded by standard first-order distributional co-occurrences. In this way, they are insufficient to differentiate hypernymy from other paradigmatic relations such as synonymy, meronymy, antonymy, etc. Incorporating directional measures of hypernymy to detect hypernymy by exploiting the common contexts of hypernym and hyponym improves this relation distinction, but still suffers from distinguishing between hypernymy and meronymy.\nOur novel approach presents two solutions to deal with these challenges. First of all, the embeddings are learned in a specific order, such that the similarity score for hypernymy is higher than the similarity score for other relations. For example, the hypernym pair animal\u2013frog will be assigned a higher cosine score than the co-hyponymy pair eagle\u2013frog. Secondly, the embeddings are learned to capture the distributional hierarchy between hyponym and hypernym, as an indicator to differentiate between hypernym and hyponym. For example, given a hyponym\u2013hypernym pair (p, q), we can exploit the Euclidean norms of ~q and ~p to differentiate between the two words, such that the Euclidean norm of the hypernym ~q is larger than the Euclidean norm of the hyponym ~p.\nInspired by the distributional lexical contrast model in Nguyen et al. (2016) for distinguishing antonymy from synonymy, this paper proposes two objective functions to learn hierarchical embeddings for hypernymy. Before moving\nto the details of the two objective functions, we first define the terms as follows: W(c) refers to the set of words co-occurring with the context c in a certain window-size; H(w) denotes the set of hypernyms for the word w; the two terms H+(w, c) and H\u2212(w, c) are drawn from H(w), and are defined as follows:\nH+(w, c) = {u \u2208W(c) \u2229H(w) : cos(~w,~c)\u2212 cos(~u,~c) \u2265 \u03b8} H\u2212(w, c) = {v \u2208W(c) \u2229H(w) : cos(~w,~c)\u2212 cos(~v,~c) < \u03b8}\nwhere cos(~x, ~y) stands for the cosine similarity of the two vectors ~x and ~y; \u03b8 is the margin. The set H+(w, c) contains all hypernyms of the word w that share the context c and satisfy the constraint that the cosine similarity of pair (w, c) is higher than the cosine similarity of pair (u, c) within a max-margin framework \u03b8. Similarly, the set H\u2212(w, c) represents all hypernyms of the word w with respect to the common context c in which the cosine similarity difference between the pair (w, c) and the pair (v, c) is within a min-margin framework \u03b8. The two objective functions are defined as follows:\nL(w,c) = 1\n#(w, u) \u2211 u\u2208H+(w,c) \u2202(~w, ~u) (3)\nL(v,w,c) = \u2211\nv\u2208H\u2212(w,c) \u2202(~v, ~w) (4)\nwhere the term \u2202(~x, ~y) stands for the cosine derivative of (~x, ~y); and \u2202 then is optimized by the negative sampling procedure.\nThe objective function in Equation 3 minimizes the distributional difference between the hyponym w and the hypernym u by exploiting the common context c. More specifically, if the common context c is the distinctive characteristic of the hyponym w (i.e. the common context c is closer to the hyponym w than to the hypernym u), the objective function L(w,c) tries to decrease the distributional generality of hypernym u by moving w closer to u. For example, given a hypernymhyponym pair animal\u2013bird, the context flap is a distinctive characteristic of bird, because almost every bird can flap, but not every animal can flap. Therefore, the context flap is closer to the hyponym bird than to the hypernym animal. The model then tries to move bird closer to animal in order to enforce the similarity between bird and animal, and to decrease the distributional generality of animal.\nIn contrast to Equation 3, the objective function in Equation 4 minimizes the distributional difference between the hyponym w and the hypernym v by exploiting the common context c, which is a distinctive characteristic of the hypernym v. In this case, the objective function L(v,w,c) tries to reduce the distributional generality of hyponym w by moving v closer to w. For example, the context word rights, a distinctive characteristic of the hypernym animal, should be closer to animal than to bird. Hence, the model tries to move the hypernym animal closer to the hyponym bird. Given that hypernymy is an asymmetric and also a hierarchical relation, where each hypernym may contain several hyponyms, our objective functions updates simultaneously both the hypernym and all of its hyponyms; therefore, our objective functions are able to capture the hierarchical relations between the hypernym and its hyponyms. Moreover, in our model, the margin framework \u03b8 plays a role in learning the hierarchy of hypernymy, and in preventing the model from minimizing the distance of synonymy or antonymy, because synonymy and antonymy share many contexts.\nIn the final step, the objective function which is used to learn the hierarchical embeddings for hypernymy combines Equations 1, 2, 3, and 4 by the objective function in Equations 5 and 6:\nJ(w,v,c) = J(w,c) + L(w,c) + L(v,w,c) (5) J = \u2211\nw\u2208VW \u2211 c\u2208VC J(w,v,c) (6)"}, {"heading": "3.2 Unsupervised Hypernymy Measure", "text": "HyperVec is expected to show the two following properties: (i) the hyponym and the hypernym are close to each other, and (ii) there exists a distributional hierarchy between hypernyms and their hyponyms. Given a hypernymy pair (u, v) in which u is the hyponym and v is the hypernym, we propose a measure to detect hypernymy and to determine the directionality of hypernymy by using the hierarchical embeddings as follows:\nHyperScore(u, v) = cos(~u,~v) \u2217 \u2016~v\u2016 \u2016~u\u2016\n(7)\nwhere cos(~u,~v) is the cosine similarity between ~u and ~v, and \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016 is the magnitude of the vector (or the Euclidean norm). The cosine similarity is applied to distinguish hypernymy from other re-\nlations, due to the first property of the hierarchical embeddings, while the second property is used to decide about the directionality of hypernymy, assuming that the magnitude of the hypernym is larger than the magnitude of the hyponym. Note that the proposed hypernymy measure is unsupervised when the resource is only used to learn hierarchical embeddings."}, {"heading": "4 Experiments", "text": "In this section, we first describe the experimental settings in our experiments (Section 4.1).

We train our model with 100 dimensions, a window size of 5, 15 negative samples, and 0.025 as the learning rate. The threshold \u03b8 is set to 0.05.

(2017) conducted an extensive evaluation of a large number of unsupervised distributional measures for hypernymy ranking retrieval proposed in previous work (Weeds and Weir, 2003; Santus et al., 2014; Clarke, 2009;\nKotlerman et al., 2010; Lenci and Benotto, 2012; Santus et al., 2016). The evaluation was performed on four semantic relation datasets: BLESS (Baroni and Lenci, 2011), WEEDS (Weeds et al., 2004), EVALUTION (Santus et al., 2015), and LENCI&BENOTTO (Benotto, 2015).

The Average Precision (AP) ranking measure is used to evaluate the performance of the measures.\nIn comparison to the state-of-the-art unsupervised measures compared by Shwartz et al. (2017) (henceforth, baseline models), we apply our unsupervised measure HyperScore (Equation 7) to rank hypernymy against other relations. Table 2\npresents the results of using HyperScore vs. the best baseline models, across datasets. When detecting hypernymy among all other relations (which is the most challenging task), HyperScore significantly outperforms all baseline variants on all datasets. The strongest difference is reached on the BLESS dataset, where HyperScore achieves an improvement of 40% AP score over the best baseline model. When ranking hypernymy in comparison to a single other relation, HyperScore also improves over the baseline models, except for the event relation in the BLESS dataset. We assume that this is due to the different parts-ofspeech (adjective and noun) involved in the relation, where HyperVec fails to establish a hierarchy."}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Classification", "text": "In this setup, we rely on three datasets of semantic relations, which were all used in various state-of-the-art approaches before, and brought together for hypernymy evaluation by Kiela et al. (2015). (i) A subset of BLESS contains 1,337 hyponym-hypernym pairs. The task is to predict the directionality of hypernymy within a binary classification. Our approach requires no threshold; we only need to compare the magnitudes of the two words and to assign the hypernym label to the word with the larger magnitude. Figure 1a indicates that the magnitude values of the SGNS model cannot distinguish between a hyponym and a hypernym, while the hierarchical embeddings provide a larger magnitude for the hypernym. (ii) Following Weeds et al. (2014), we conduct a binary classification with a subset of 1,168 BLESS word pairs. In this dataset (WBLESS), one class is represented by hyponym\u2013hypernym pairs, and the other class is a combination of re-\nversed hypernym\u2013hyponym pairs, plus additional holonym-meronym pairs, co-hyponyms and randomly matched nouns. For this classification we make use of our HyperScore measure that ranks hypernymy pairs higher than other relation pairs. A threshold decides about the splitting point between the two classes: hyper vs. other. Instead of using a manually defined threshold as done by Kiela et al. (2015), we decided to run 1 000 iterations which randomly sampled only 2% of the available pairs for learning a threshold, using the remaining 98% for test purposes. We present average accuracy results across all iterations. Figure 1b compares the default cosine similarities between the relation pairs (as applied by SGNS ) and HyperScore (as applied by HyperVec) on this task. Using HyperScore, the class \u201chyper\u201d can clearly be distinguished from the class \u201cother\u201d. (iii) BIBLESS represents the most challenging dataset; the relation pairs from WBLESS are split into three classes instead of two: hypernymy pairs, reversed hypernymy pairs, and other relation pairs. In this case, we perform a three-way classification. We apply the same technique as used for the WBLESS classification, but in cases where we classify hyper we additionally classify the hypernymy direction, to decide between hyponym\u2013hypernym pairs and reversed hypernym\u2013hyponym pairs.\nTable 3 compares our results against related\nwork. HyperVec outperforms all other methods on all three tasks. In addition we see again that an unmodified SGNS model cannot solve any of the three tasks."}, {"heading": "4.3 Supervised Hypernymy Detection", "text": "For supervised hypernymy detection, we make use of the two datasets: the full BLESS dataset, and ENTAILMENT (Baroni et al., 2012), containing 2,770 relation pairs in total, including 1,385 hypernym pairs and 1,385 other relations pairs. We follow the same procedure as Yu et al. (2015) and Tuan et al. (2016) to assess HyperVec on the two datasets. Regarding BLESS, we extract pairs for four types of relations: hypernymy, meronymy, co-hyponymy (or coordination), and add the random relation for nouns. For the evaluation, we randomly select one concept and its relatum for testing, and train the supervised model on the 199 remaining concepts and its relatum. We then report the average accuracy across all concepts. For the ENTAILMENT dataset, we randomly select one hypernym pair for testing and train on all remaining hypernym pairs. Again, we report the average accuracy across all hypernyms.\nWe apply an SVM classifier to detect hypernymy based on HyperVec. Given a hyponym\u2013 hypernym pair (u, v), we concatenate four components to construct the vector for a pair (u, v) as follows: the vector difference between hypernym and hyponym (~v\u2212~u); the cosine similarity between the hypernym and hyponym vectors (cos(~u,~v)); the magnitude of the hyponym (\u2016~u\u2016); and the magnitude of the hypernym (\u2016~v\u2016). The resulting vector is fed into the SVM classifier to detect hypernymy. Similar to the two previous works, we train the SVM classifier with the RBF kernel, \u03bb = 0.03125, and the penalty C = 8.0.\nTable 4 shows the performance of HyperVec and the two baseline models reported by Tuan et al.

HyperLex contains 2,616 word pairs across seven semantic relations and two word classes (nouns and verbs).

The motivation behind using these concepts is threefold: i) these concepts are distinct and unambiguous noun concepts; ii) the concepts were equally divided between living and non-living entities; iii) concepts have been grouped into 17 broader classes. Based on the seed set, we collected the hyponyms of each concept from WordNet, and then re-trained HyperVec.

Overall, the results show that HyperVec is indeed able to generalize hypernymy from small seeds of training data.\nGeneralizing Hypernymy across Languages: We assume that hypernymy detection can be improved across languages by projecting representations from any arbitrary language into our modified English HyperVec space. We conduct experiments for German and Italian, where the languagespecific representations are obtained using the same hyper-parameter settings as for our English SGNS model (cf. Section 4.1). As corpus resource we relied on Wikipedia dumps2. Note that we do not use any additional resource, such as the German or Italian WordNet, to tune the embeddings for hypernymy detection. Based on the representations, a mapping function between a source language (German, Italian) and our English HyperVec space is learned, by relying on the least-squares error method from previous work using cross-lingual data (Mikolov et al., 2013a) and different modalities (Lazaridou et al., 2015).\nTo learn a mapping function between two languages, a one-to-one correspondence (word translations) between two sets of vectors is required. We obtained these translations by using the parallel Europarl3 V7 corpus for German\u2013English and Italian\u2013English. Word alignment counts were extracted using fast align (Dyer et al., 2013). We then assigned each source word to the English word with the maximum number of alignments in the parallel corpus. We could match 25,547 pairs for DE\u2192EN and 47,475 pairs for IT\u2192EN.\nTaking the aligned subset of both spaces, we assume that X is the matrix obtained by concatenating all source vectors, and likewise Y is the matrix obtained by concatenating all corresponding English elements. Applying the `2-regularized leastsquares error objective can be described using the following equation:\nW\u0302 = argmin W\u2208Rd1\u00d7d2 \u2016XW\u2212 Y\u2016+ \u03bb\u2016W\u2016 (8)\nAlthough we learn the mapping only on a subset of aligned words, it allows us to project every word in\n2The Wikipedia dump for German and Italian were both downloaded in January 2017.\n3 http://www.statmt.org/europarl/\na source vocabulary to its English HyperVec position by using W.\nFinally we compare the original representations and the mapped representation on the hypernymy ranking retrieval task (similar to Section 4.2.1). As gold resources we relied on German and Italian nouns pairs. For German we used the 282 German pairs collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk by Scheible and Schulte im Walde (2014). The 1,350 Italian pairs were collected via Crowdflower by Sucameli (2015) in the same way. Both collections contain hypernymy, antonymy and synonymy pairs. As before, we evaluate the ranking by AP, and we compare the cosine of the unmodified default representations against the HyperScore of the projected representations.\nThe results are shown in Table 6. We clearly see that for both languages the default SGNS embeddings do not provide higher similarity scores for hypernymy pairs (except for Italian Hyp/Ant), but both languages provide higher scores when we map the embeddings into the English HyperVec space."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "This paper proposed a novel neural model HyperVec to learn hierarchical embeddings for hypernymy. HyperVec has been shown to strengthen hypernymy similarity, and to capture the distributional hierarchy of hypernymy.
