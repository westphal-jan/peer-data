The problem involves a seller who wants to sell one or several items to one or multiple strategic bidders with private valuation functions, mapping each bundle of items they may receive to how much value they derive from the bundle. As no meaningful revenue guarantee can possibly be achieved without any information about the valuations of the bidders, the problem has been classically studied under Bayesian assumptions, where a joint distribution from which all bidders\u2019 valuations are drawn is common knowledge, and the goal is to maximize revenue in expectation with respect to this distribution.\nIn the single-item setting, Bayesian assumptions have enabled beautiful and influential developments in auction theory. Already 36 years ago, a breakthrough result by Myerson identified the optimal single-item auction when bidder values are independent [36], and the ensuing decades saw a great deal of further understanding and practical applications of single-item auctions, importantly in online settings.\nHowever, the quest for optimal multi-item auctions has been quite more challenging. It has been recognized that revenue-optimal multi-item auctions can be really complex, may exhibit counter-intuitive properties, and be fragile to changes in the underlying distributions; for a discussion and examples see survey [18]. As such, it is doubtful that there is a crisp characterization of the structure of optimal multi-item auctions, at least not beyond single-bidder settings [19]. On the other hand, there has been significant recent progress in efficient computation of revenue-optimal auctions [14, 15, 1, 7, 3, 8, 9, 12, 10, 2, 6, 20]. Importantly, this progress has enabled identifying simple auctions (mostly variations of sequential posted pricing mechanisms) that achieve constant factor approximations to the revenue of the optimum [5, 42, 11, 16, 13], under the item-independence assumption of Definition 1 and Example 1. These auctions are way simpler than the optimum, and have strong incentive properties: they are dominant strategy truthful, while still competing against the optimal Bayesian truthful mechanism. The current state-of-the-art is given as Theorem 8, which applies to bidders with valuation functions from the broad class of fractionally subbaditive (a.k.a. XOS) valuations, which contains submodular.\nAs our discussion illustrates, studying auctions assuming Bayesian priors has been quite fruitful, enabling us to identify guiding principles for how to structure auctions to achieve optimal (in single-item settings) or approximately optimal (in multi-item settings) revenue. To apply this theory to practice, however, one needs knowledge of the underlying distributions. Typically, one would estimate these distributions via market research or by observations of bidder behavior in prior auctions, then use the estimated distributions to design a good auction. However, estimation involves approximation, and the performance of mechanisms can be quite fragile to errors in the distributions. This motivates studying whether optimal or approximately optimal auctions can be identified when one has imperfect knowledge of the true distributions.\nWith this motivation, recent work in Computer Science has studied whether approximately optimal mechanisms can be \u201clearned\u201d given sample access to the underlying distributions. This work has lead to an almost complete picture for the single-item (and the more general single-parameter) setting where Myerson\u2019s theory applies, showing how near-optimal mechanisms can be learned from polynomially many (in the approximation and the number of bidders) samples [26, 17, 33, 31, 34, 22, 38, 29].\nOn the multi-item front, however, where the analogue of Myerson\u2019s theory is elusive, and unlikely, our understanding is much sparser. Recent work of Morgenstern and Roughgarden [35] has taken a computational learning theory approach to identify the sample complexity required to optimize over classes of simple auctions. Combined with the afore-described results on the revenue guarantees of simple auctions, their work leads to algorithms that learn approximately optimal auctions in multi-item settings with multiple unit-demand bidders, or a single subadditive bidder, from polynomially many samples in the number of items and bidders. These results apply to distributions satisfying the item-independence assumption of Definition 1 and\nExample 1, under which the approximate optimality of simple auctions has been established.\nWhile well-suited for identifying the sample complexity required to optimize over a class of simple mechanisms, which is a perfectly reasonable goal to have but not the one in this paper, the approach taken in [35] is arguably imperfect towards proving polynomial sample bounds for learning approximately optimal auctions in the settings where simple mechanisms are known to perform well in the first place. This is due to the following discordance: (i) On the one hand, simple and approximately optimal mechanisms in multi-item settings are mostly only known under item-independence. (ii) On the other hand, the computational learning techniques employed in [35], and in particular bounding the pseudo-dimension of a class of auctions, are not fine enough to discern the difference in sample complexity required to optimize under item-independence and without itemindependence. As such, this technique can only obtain polynomial sample bounds for approximate revenue optimization if it so happens that a class of mechanisms is both learnable from polynomially-many samples under arbitrary distributions, and it guarantees approximately optimal revenue under item-independence, or for some other interesting class of distributions.1\nIn particular, bounding the pseudo-dimension of classes of auctions as a means to prove polynomialsample bounds for approximate revenue optimization hits a barrier even for multiple additive bidders with independent values for items. In this setting, the approximately optimal auctions that are known are the best of selling the items separately or running a VCG mechanism with entry fees [42, 11], as described in Section 5.2. Unfortunately, the latter can easily be seen to have pseudo-dimension that is exponential in the number of bidders, thus only implying a sufficient exponentially large sample size to optimize over these mechanisms. Is this exponential sample size really necessary or an artifact of the approach? Recent work of Goldner and Karlin [28] gives us hope that it is the latter. They show how to learn approximately optimal auctions in the multi-item multi-bidder setting with additive bidders using only one sample from each bidder\u2019s distribution, assuming that it is regular and independent across items.\nOur results. We show that simple and approximately optimal mechanisms are learnable from polynomiallymany samples for multi-item multi-bidder settings, whenever:\n\u2022 the bidder valuations are fractionally subadditive (XOS), i.e. we can accommodate additive, unitdemand, constrained additive, and submodular valuations;\n\u2022 the distributions over valuations satisfy the standard item-independence assumption of Definition 1 and Example 1, and their single-item marginals are arbitrary and bounded, or (have arbitrary supports but\nare) regular.2\nIn particular, our results constitute vast extensions of known results on the polynomial learnability of approximately optimal auctions in multi-item settings [35, 28]. Additionally we show that:\n\u2022 whenever the valuations are additive and unit-demand, or whenever the bidders are symmetric and have XOS valuations, our approximately optimal mechanisms can be identified from polynomially many\nsamples and in polynomial time;\n\u2022 whenever the bidders are symmetric (i.e. their valuations are independent and identically distributed) and have subadditive valuations, we can compute from polynomially many samples and in polynomial-time\na simple mechanism whose revenue is a \u2126 (\nn max{m,n}\n) -fraction of the optimum, where m and n are\nrespectively the number of items and bidders. In particular, if the number of bidders is at least a constant fraction of the number of items, the mechanism is a constant factor approximation; and\n1It is known that some restriction needs to be made on the distribution to gain polynomial sample complexity, as otherwise exponential lower bounds are known for learning approximately optimal auctions even for a single unit-demand bidder [24]. 2We note again that without the standard item-independence (or some other) restriction on the distributions, we cannot hope to learn approximately optimal auctions from sub-exponentially many samples, even for a single unit-demand bidder [24].\n\u2022 in the setting of the previous bullet, if the itemmarginals are regular, our mechanism is prior-independent, i.e. there is a single mechanism, identifiable without any samples from the distributions, providing the\nafore-described revenue guarantee.\nFinally, the mechanisms learned by our algorithms for XOS bidders are either rationed sequential posted price mechanisms (RSPMs) or anonymous sequential posted price mechanisms with entry fees (ASPEs) as defined in Section 6. The mechanisms learned for symmetric subadditive bidders are RSPMs. RSPMs maintain a price pij for every bidder and item pair and, in some order over bidders i = 1, . . . , n, they give one opportunity to bidder i to purchase one item j that has not been purchased yet at price pij . ASPEs maintain one price pj for every item and, in some order over bidders i = 1, . . . , n, they give one opportunity to bidder i to purchase any subset S\u2032 of the items S that have not been purchased yet as long as he also pays an \u201centry fee\u201d that depends on S and the identity of the bidder. See Algorithm 3.\nLearning without Samples. Thus far, our algorithms used samples from the valuation distributions to identify an approximately optimal and simple mechanism under item-independence. However, having sample access to the distributions may be impractical. Often we can observe the actions used by bidders in non-truthful auctions that were previously run, and use these observations to estimate the distributions over valuations using econometric methods [30, 37, 4]. In fact, it may likely be the case we have never sold all the items together in the past, and only have observations of bidder behavior in non-truthful auctions selling each item separately. Econometric methods would achieve better approximations in this case, but only for the item marginals. Finally, we may want to combine multiple sources of information about the distributions, combining past bidder behavior in several different auctions and with market research data.\nWith this motivation in mind, we would like to extend our learnability results beyond the setting where sample access to the valuation distributions is provided. We propose \u201clearning\u201d approximately optimal multiitem auctions given distributions that are close to the true distributions under some distribution distance d(\u00b7, \u00b7). In particular, given approximate distributions D\u03021, . . . , D\u0302n over bidder valuations, we are looking to identify a mechanism M satisfying the following max-min style objective:\n\u2200D1, . . . ,Dn s.t. d(Di, D\u0302i) \u2264 \u01eb,\u2200i : RevM(D1, . . . ,Dn) \u2265 \u2126(OPT(D1, . . . ,Dn))\u2212 poly(\u01eb,m, n). (1)\nThat is, we want to find a mechanismM whose revenue is within a constant multiplicative and a poly(\u01eb,m, n) additive error from optimum, simultaneously in all possible worlds D1, . . . ,Dn, where d(Di, D\u0302i) \u2264 \u01eb,\u2200i. It is not a priori clear that such a \u201cone-fits-all\u201d mechanism actually exists.\nThere are several notions of distance d(\u00b7, \u00b7) between distributions that we could study in the formulation of Goal (1), but we opt for an easy one to satisfy. We only require that we know every bidder\u2019s marginal distributions over single-item values to within \u01eb in Kolmogorov distance;3 see Definition 2. All that this requires is that the cumulative density functions of the approximating distributions over single-item values is within \u01eb in infinity norm from the corresponding cumulative density functions of the corresponding true distributions. As such, it is an easy property to satisfy. For example, given sample access to any single-item marginal, the DKW inequality [25] implies that O(log(1/\u03b4)/\u01eb2) samples suffice to learn it to within \u01eb in Kolmogorov distance, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4. So achieving Goal (1) directly also implies polynomial sample learnability of approximately optimal auctions. But a Kolmogorov approximation can also be arrived at by combining different sources of information about the single-item marginals such as the ones described above. Regardless of how the approximations were obtained, the max-min goal outlined above guarantees\n3Indeed, Goal (1) is achievable only for bounded distributions even in the single-item single-bidder setting. Given any bounded distribution D\u0302, create D by moving \u01eb probability mass in D\u0302 to +\u221e. It is not hard to see that D and D\u0302 are within \u01eb in Kolmogorov distance, but no single mechanism can satisfy the approximation guarantee for bothD and D\u0302 simultaneously. Using a similar argument, we can argue that the additive error has to depend onH which is the upper bound on any bidder\u2019s value for a single item. See Section 2 for our formal model.\nrobustness of the revenue of the identified mechanism M with respect to all sources of error that came into the estimation of the single-item marginal distributions.\nWhile Goal (1) is not a priori feasible, we show how to achieve it in multi-item multi-bidder settings with constrained additive bidders, or symmetric bidders with subadditive valuations, under the standard assumption of item-independence. Our results are polynomial-time in the same cases as our sample-based results discussed above.\nRoadmap and Technical Ideas. In Section 4, we present a new approach for obtaining uniform convergence bounds for hypotheses classes under product distributions; see Theorem 2 and Corollary 1. We show that our approach can significantly improve the sample complexity bound obtained via traditional methods such as VC theory. In particular, Table 3 compares the sample complexity bounds obtained via our approach to those obtained by VC theory for different classes of hypotheses.\nOur results for mechanisms make use of recent work on the revenue guarantees of simple mechanisms, which are mainly variants of sequential posted pricing mechanisms [11, 13]. Using our results from Section 4, in Section 5, we derive uniform convergence bounds for the revenue of a class of mechanisms shown to achieve a constant fraction of optimal revenue when all bidders have valuations that are constrained additive over independent items. These mechanisms are called Sequential Posted Price with Entry Fee Mechanisms, a.k.a. SPEMs,4. As a corollary of the uniform convergence of SPEMs, we obtain our sample based results for constrained additive bidders. In fact, we obtain a slightly stronger statement than uniform convergence of the revenue of SPEMs, which also implies our max-min results for constrained-additive bidders; see Theorems 3 and 4. In particular, Theorem 4 and the DKW inequality imply the polynomial-sample learnability of approximately revenue-optimal auctions for constrained additive bidders.\nTechnically speaking, our sample based and max-min approximation results for constrained additive bidders provide a crisp illustration of how we leverage item-independence and our new uniform convergence bounds for product measures to sidestep the exponential pseudo-dimension of the class of mechanisms that we are optimizing over. Let us discuss our max-min results which are stronger. Suppose Di = \u00d7jDij is the true distribution over bidder i\u2019s valuation and D\u0302i = \u00d7jD\u0302ij is the approximating distribution, where Dij and D\u0302ij are respectively the item j marginals. To argue that the revenue of some anonymous sequential posted price with entry fees (ASPE) mechanism is similar under D = \u00d7iDi and D\u0302 = \u00d7iD\u0302i, we need to couple in total variation distance the decisions of what sets all bidders buy in the execution of the mechanism under D and D\u0302. The issue that we encounter is that there are exponentially many subsets each bidder may buy, hence the naive use of the Kolmogorov bound ||Dij \u2212 D\u0302ij ||K \u2264 \u01eb, on each single-item marginal results in an exponential blow-up in the total variation distance of what subset of items bidder i buys, invalidating our desired coupling. To circumvent this challenge, we argue in Lemma 4 that the events corresponding to which subset of items each buyer will buy are single-intersecting, according to Definition 4, when seen as events on the buyer\u2019s single-item values. Single-intersecting events may be non-convex and have infinite VC dimension. Nevertheless, because single-item values are independent, our new uniform convergence bounds for product measures (Lemma 3) imply that the difference in probabilities of any such event under D and D\u0302 is only a factor of m, the number of items, larger than the bound \u01eb on the Kolmogorov distance between single-item marginals.\nWe specialize our results to unit-demand bidders in Section 5.1 to obtain computationally efficient solutions for both max-min and sample-based models. Similarly, Section 5.2 contains our results for additive bidders. We also generalize our sample-based results for constrained additive bidders to XOS bidders in Section 6. Finally, we provide computationally efficient solutions for symmetric XOS and even symmetric subadditive bidders in Section 7. These results are based on showing that (i) the right parameters of SPEMs can be efficiently and approximately identified with sample or max-min access to the distributions; and (ii) that the revenue guarantees of simple mechanisms can be robustified to accommodate error in the setting of the\n4Note that any RSPM or ASPE is an SPEM.\nparameters. In particular, our sample-based result for unit-demand bidders robustifies the ex-ante relaxation of the revenue maximization problem from [1] and its conversion to a sequential posted pricing mechanism from [15], and makes use of the extreme-value theorem for regular distributions from [7]. Our sample-based result for additive bidders shows how to use samples to design mechanisms that approximate the revenue of Yao\u2019s VCG with entry fees mechanism [42]. Our sample-based results for XOS bidders show how to use samples to approximate the parameters of the RSPM and ASPE mechanisms of [13], and argue, by re-doing their duality proofs, that their revenue guarantees are robust to errors in the approximation. Finally, our sample based result for symmetric subadditive bidders is based on a new, duality based, approximation, showing how to eliminate the use of ASPEs from the result of [13]. This even allows us to obtain prior-independent mechanisms when the item marginals are regular."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "We focus on revenue maximization in the combinatorial auction with n independent bidders and m heterogenous items. Each bidder has a valuation that is subadditive over independent items (see Definition 1). We denote bidder i\u2019s type ti as \u3008tij\u3009 m j=1, where tij is bidder i\u2019s private information about item j. For each i, j, we assume tij is drawn independently from the distribution Dij . Let Di = \u00d7 m j=1Dij be the distribution of bidder i\u2019s type andD = \u00d7ni=1Di be the distribution of the type profile. We use Tij (or Ti, T ) and fij (or fi, f ) to denote the support and density function of Dij (or Di,D). For notational convenience, we let t\u2212i to be the types of all bidders except i. Similarly, we define D\u2212i, T\u2212i and f\u2212i for the corresponding distributions, support sets and density functions. When bidder i\u2019s type is ti, her valuation for a set of items S is denoted by vi(ti, S). Throughout the paper we use OPT to denote the optimal revenue obtainable by any randomized and Bayesian truthful mechanism.\nDefinition 1.

When vi(ti, \u00b7) is XOS (or constrained additive) for all i and ti \u2208 Ti, we say Vi is XOS (or constrained additive) over independent items.\nExample 1. [40] We may instantiate Definition 1 to define restricted families of subadditive valuations as follows. In all cases, suppose t = {tj}j\u2208[m] is drawn from \u00d7jDj . To define a valuation function that is:\n- unit-demand, we can take tj to be the value of item j, and set v(t, S) = maxj\u2208S tj . - additive, we can take tj to be the value of item j, and set v(t, S) = \u2211 j\u2208S tj . - constrained additive, we can take tj to be the value of item j, and set v(t, S) = maxR\u2286S,R\u2208I \u2211 j\u2208R tj , for some downward closed set system I \u2286 2[m]. - XOS (a.k.a. fractionally subadditive), we can take tj = {t (k) j }k\u2208[K] to encode all possible values associated with item j, and take v(t, S) = maxk\u2208[K] \u2211 j\u2208S t (k) j .\nNote that constrained additive valuations contain additive and unit-demand valuations as special cases,\nand are contained in XOS valuations."}, {"heading": "Distribution Access Models", "text": "We consider the following three different models to access the distributions.\n\u2022 Sample access to bounded distributions.

Suppose H contains the indicator functions of all convex sets in Rd. VC theory does not provide any finite sample bound for uniform convergence, as the VC dimension of H is \u221e. Do our results provide a finite bound? Notice that, for all i, Hi simply contains all intervals in R. Hence, Vi = 2 and Corollary 1 implies that \u2113 = O( d2 \u01eb2 \u00b7 ( log d\u03b4 + log d \u01eb ) ) samples suffice to obtain (\u01eb, \u03b4)-p.m. uniform convergence for H . In fact, our sample complexity bound can be improved to O ( d2\n\u01eb2 \u00b7 log d \u03b4\n) , as O ( log 1 \u03b4\n\u01eb2\n) samples suffice to guarantee (\u01eb, \u03b4)-uniform convergence for all\nintervals in R due to the DKW inequality [25].\nIn the next a few sections, we apply our uniform convergence results to learn a mechanism with approximately optimal revenue. A type of events called single-intersecting (see Definition 4) plays a key role in our analysis. These events are defined based on the geometric shape of the corresponding sets. For example, balls, rectangles and all convex sets are single-intersecting, but this definition includes some non-convex sets as well, for example, \u201ccross-shaped\u201d sets. It turns out that being able to handle these non-convex sets is crucial for our results, as many events we care about are not convex but nonetheless are single-intersecting.\nDefinition 4 (Single-intersecting Events). For any event E in R\u2113, E is single-intersecting if the intersection of E and any line that is parallel to one of the axes is an interval. More formally, for any i \u2208 [\u2113] and any line Li = { x \u2208 R\u2113 | x\u2212i = a\u2212i } , where a\u2212i \u2208 R\n\u2113\u22121, the intersection of Li and E is of the form{ x \u2208 R\u2113 | x\u2212i = a\u2212i, xi \u2208 [\n\u00af a, a\u0304]\n} where\n\u00af a \u2264 a\u0304. In particular, we allow \u00af a to be \u2212\u221e and a\u0304 to be +\u221e.\nWe establish a uniform convergence bound for single-intersecting events by combing the DKW inequality and Theorem 1.\nLemma 2. For any integer \u2113, let H be the hypothesis class that contains all indicator functions for singleintersecting events in R\u2113. ThenH has (\u01eb, \u03b4)-p.m. uniform convergence with sample complexity O ( \u21132\n\u01eb2 \u00b7 log \u2113\u03b4\n) .\nProof. As the projected hypothesis class for the i-th coordinate simply contains all intervals in R, the sample complexity for (\u01eb, \u03b4)-uniform convergence isO( 1\n\u01eb2 \u00b7 log 1\u03b4 ) due to the DKW inequality. The claim follows from\nTheorem 1.\nNext, we show a slightly stronger statement, which is a type of uniform convergence bound when access to approximate distributions is given. More specifically, we argue that for any single-intersecting event, the difference in the probability of this event under two product distributions D = \u00d7i\u2208[\u2113]Di and D\u0302 = \u00d7i\u2208[\u2113]D\u0302i is at most 2\u03be \u00b7 \u2113, if ||Di \u2212 D\u0302i||K \u2264 \u03be for all i. It is not hard to see that Lemma 3 and the DKW inequality imply Lemma 2.\nLemma 3. For any integer \u2113, let D = \u00d7\u2113i=1Di and D\u0302 = \u00d7 \u2113 i=1D\u0302i, where Di and D\u0302i are both supported on R\nfor any i \u2208 [\u2113].

SPEMs; see Algorithm 1 for details. Cai and Zhao [13] recently showed that if the bidders\u2019 valuations are XOS\nover independent items, the best SPEM achieves a constant fraction of the optimal revenue. 5 This section has two goals. The first is to show that, when bidders have constrained additive valuations over independent items, polynomially many samples suffice to guarantee uniform convergence for the revenue of all SPEMs, and hence our ability to select a near-optimal SPEM from polynomially many samples. This can be proven by applying our uniform convergence result for single-intersecting events (Lemma 2). The second (and stronger goal) is to show that we can learn a near-optimal SPEM under the max-min learning model (Theorem 4). We show that the revenue of any SPEM changes no more than O(\u01eb \u00b7 m2 \u00b7 n \u00b7H) under the true and approximate valuation distributions (Theorem 3), where \u01eb is an upper bound of the Kolmogorov distance between the true and approximate distributions for every item marginal of every bidder. It is, of course, not hard to see that Theorem 3 and the DKW inequality imply uniform convergence of the revenue of all SPEMS. To establish Theorem 3, we need to apply Lemma 3 instead of Lemma 2.\nAlgorithm 1 Sequential Posted Price with Entry Fee Mechanism (SPEM)\nRequire: A collection of prices {pij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m] and a collection of entry fee functions {\u03b4i(\u00b7)}i\u2208[n] where\n\u03b4i : 2 [m] 7\u2192 R is bidder i\u2019s entry fee function.\n1: S \u2190 [m] 2: for i \u2208 [n] do 3: Show bidder i the set of available items S and set the entry fee for bidder i to be \u03b4i(S). 4: if Bidder i pays the entry fee \u03b4i(S) then 5: i receives her favorite bundle S\u2217i and pays \u2211 j\u2208S\u2217i pij . 6: S \u2190 S\\S\u2217i . 7: else 8: i gets nothing and pays 0. 9: end if\n10: end for\nWe first establish a technical lemma, which states that, for any set of items S, any set of prices {pj}j\u2208[m] and entry fee \u03b4, the distribution over the set of items purchased by a constrained additive bidder whose valuation is drawn fromD = \u00d7j\u2208[m]Dj and D\u0302 = \u00d7j\u2208[m]D\u0302j has total variation distance at most 2m\u03be, if ||Dj\u2212D\u0302j ||K \u2264 \u03be for every item j \u2208 [m]. This is quite surprising. Given that, for each set of items S\u2032 \u2286 S, the difference in the probability that the buyer will purchase this particular set S\u2032 under D and D\u0302 could already be as large as \u0398(m\u03be), and the distribution has an exponentially large support size, a trivial argument would give a bound of 2m \u00b7 \u0398(m\u03be). To overcome this analytical difficulty, we argue instead that for any collection of sets of items, the event that the buyer\u2019s favorite set lies in this collection is single-intersecting. Then our result follows from Lemma 3. Notice that it is crucial that Lemma 3 holds for all events that are single-intersecting, as the event we consider here is clearly non-convex in general.\nLemma 4. For any set S \u2286 [m], any prices {pj}j\u2208[m] and entry fee \u03b4(S), let L and L\u0302 be the distributions over the set of items purchased from S by a constrained additive bidder under prices {pj}j\u2208[m] and entry fee \u03b4 when her type is drawn from D = \u00d7j\u2208[m]Dj and D\u0302 = \u00d7j\u2208[m]D\u0302j respectively. If ||Dj \u2212 D\u0302j ||K \u2264 \u03be for all item j, ||L \u2212 L\u0302||TV \u2264 2m\u03be.\nProof. For any set R \u2286 S, let ER be the event that the bidder purchases set R. Proving that the total variation distance between L and L\u0302 is no more than 2m \u00b7 \u03be is the same as proving that for any K \u2264 2|S|,\u2223\u2223\u2223 PrD [ t \u2208 \u22c3K \u2113=1 ER\u2113 ] \u2212 PrD\u0302 [ t \u2208 \u22c3K \u2113=1 ER\u2113\n]\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 2m \u00b7 \u03be where R1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RK are arbitrary distinct subsets of 5Cai and Zhao [13] showed that the best ASPE or RSPM achieves a constant fraction of the optimal revenue. Clearly, any ASPE is also a SPEM, and any RSPM is simply a SPEM if we force the bidders to be unit-demand by only allowing each of them to purchase at most one item.\nS. Since the dimension of the bidder\u2019s type space is m, if we can prove that \u22c3K\n\u2113=1 ER\u2113 is always singleintersecting, our claim follows from Lemma 3.\nFor any j \u2208 [m] and a\u2212j \u2208 R m\u22121 \u22650 , let Lj(a\u2212j) = {(tj, a\u2212j) |tj \u2208 R\u22650}. We claim that Lj(a\u2212j) intersects with at most two different EU and EV where U and V are subsets of S. WLOG, we assume that (0, a\u2212j) \u2208 EU .\n\u2022 If U = \u2205, that means the utility of the favorite set for type (0, a\u2212j) is smaller than the entry fee \u03b4(S). If we increase the value of tj , two cases could happen: (1) the utility of the favorite set is still lower than the entry fee; (2) the utility of the favorite set is higher than the entry fee. In case (1), (tj , a\u2212j) \u2208 E\u2205. In case (2), the bidder pays the entry fee and purchases her favorite set V . Then item j must be in V , because otherwise the utility for set V does not change from type (0, a\u2212j) to type (tj , a\u2212j). If we keep increasing tj , bidder i\u2019s favorite set remains to be V and she keeps accepting the entry fee and purchasing V . Hence, Lj(a\u2212j) can intersect with at most one event ER where R is non-empty.\n\u2022 If U 6= \u2205, that means U is the favorite set of type (0, a\u2212j) and the utility for winning set U is higher than the entry fee. If we increase the value of tj , two cases could happen: (1) U remains the favorite set; (2) a different set V becomes the new favorite set. In case (1), (tj , a\u2212j) \u2208 EU . In case (2), item j must lie in V but not in U , otherwise how could U be better than V for type (0, a\u2212j) but worse for type (tj , a\u2212j). If we keep increasing tj , the bidder\u2019s favorite set remains to be V and she keeps accepting the entry fee and purchasing V . Hence, Lj(a\u2212j) can intersect at most two different events.\nIt is not hard to see that any event ER is an intersection of halfspaces, so the intersection of Lj(a\u2212j) with any event ER is an interval. Also, notice that any type t \u2208 R m \u22650 must lie in an event ER for some set R \u2286 S. If Lj(a\u2212j) intersects with two different events EU and EV , the two intersected intervals must lie back to back on Lj(a\u2212j). Otherwise, Lj(a\u2212j) intersects with at least three different events. Contradiction. Since Lj(a\u2212j) intersects with at most two different events, no matter which of these events are in {ER\u2113}\u2113\u2208[K], the intersection\nof Lj(a\u2212j) and \u22c3K \u2113=1 ER\u2113 is either empty or an interval meaning \u22c3K\n\u2113=1 ER\u2113 is single-intersecting. Now our claim simply follows from Lemma 3.\nTheorem 3. Suppose all bidders\u2019 valuations are constrained additive over independent items. For any SPEM, let REV and R\u0302EV be its expected revenue under D and D\u0302 respectively. If Dij and D\u0302ij are both supported on [0,H], and ||Dij \u2212 D\u0302ij ||K \u2264 \u03be for all i \u2208 [n] and j \u2208 [m],\n\u2223\u2223\u2223REV \u2212 R\u0302EV \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 2nm\u03be \u00b7 (mH + OPT) .\nProof. We use a hybrid argument. Consider a sequence of distributions {D(i)}i\u2264n, where D (i) = D\u03021 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 D\u0302i\u00d7Di+1\u00d7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00d7Dn, andD (0) = D,D(n) = D\u0302. We use REV(i) to denote the expected revenue of the SPEM\nunder D(i). To prove our claim, it suffices to argue that \u2223\u2223\u2223REV(i\u22121) \u2212 REV(i) \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 2\u03bem \u00b7 (m \u00b7H + OPT) . We denote by Sk and S \u2032 k the random set of items that remain available after visiting the first k bidders underD (i\u22121) and D(i). Clearly, for k \u2264 i \u2212 1, ||Sk \u2212 S \u2032 k||TV = 0, so the expected revenue collected from the first i \u2212 1 bidders under D(i\u22121) and D(i) is the same. According to Lemma 4, ||Si \u2212 S \u2032 i||TV \u2264 2m \u00b7 \u03be. The total amount of money bidder i spends can never be higher than her value for receiving all the items which is at mostm \u00b7H . So the difference in the expected revenue collected from bidder i under D(i\u22121) and D(i) is at most 2\u03be \u00b7m2H . Suppose R is the set of remaining items after visiting the first i bidders, then the expected revenue collected from the last n \u2212 i bidders is the same under D(i\u22121) and D(i), as these bidders have the same distributions. Moreover, this expected revenue is no more than OPT, since the optimal mechanism can simply just sell R to the last n \u2212 i bidders using the same prices and entry fee as in the SPEM we consider. Of course, for any fixed R, the probabilities that Si = R and S \u2032 i = R are different, but since for any R the expected revenue from the last n\u2212 i bidders is at most OPT, the difference in the expected revenue from the last n\u2212 i bidders under\nD(i\u22121) and D(i) is at most ||Si \u2212 S \u2032 i||TV \u00b7 OPT \u2264 2\u03be \u00b7mOPT. Hence, the total difference between REV (i\u22121) and REV(i) is at most 2\u03bem \u00b7 (mH + OPT).\nTheorem 4. (Max-min Learning for Constrained Additive Bidders) When all bidders\u2019 valuations are constrained additive over independent items and for any bidder i and any item j, Dij and D\u0302ij are supported on [0,H] and ||Dij \u2212 D\u0302ij||K \u2264 \u01eb for some \u01eb = O( 1 nm ), then with only access to D\u0302 = \u00d7i,jD\u0302ij , our algorithm can learn an RSPM or ASPE whose revenue is at least OPTc \u2212 \u01eb \u00b7O(m 2nH), where OPT is the optimal revenue by any BIC mechanism under D = \u00d7i,jDij . c > 1 is an absolute constant.\nClearly, Theorem 4 also implies a polynomial sample complexity bound for learning an approximately revenue-optimal mechanism. A better sample complexity bound can be obtained directly, i.e. without invoking the uniform convergence of the revenue of SPEMs, and is stated as Theorem 9 for the broader class of XOS valuations.

Next, we consider a similar convex program based on D\u0302 (see Figure 2) and show that the optima of the two convex programs are close to each other. Finally, we use techniques developed by Chawla et al. [15] to convert the optimal solution of the second convex program into a randomized SPM.

They showed that there exists an entry fee Xi, such that bidder i accepts the entry fee with probability at least 1/2. Then they argued that extracting Xi/2 as the revenue in the VCG with entry fee mechanism is enough to obtain a factor 8 approximation. It is not hard to observe that our entry fee is accepted with probability exactly 1/2, thus our entry fee is at least as large as Xi. So our mechanism also suffices to provide a factor 8 approximation.\nSREV. For BREV, we show that for every bidder i and every bid profile b\u2212i of the other bidders, the event that corresponds to bidder i accepting any entry fee is single-intersecting (see Definition 4). This implies that the probability for a bidder to accept an entry fee under D\u0302 and D is close (Lemma 3).

The seller visits the bidders sequentially. For every bidder, the seller shows her all the available items (i.e. items that have not yet been purchased) and the associated price for each item, then asks her to pay a personalized entry fee which depends on her type distribution and the set of available items.

In Section 5.1, we have shown how to learn an approximately optimal mechanism for unit-demand bidders, and those algorithms can be used to approximate the best RSPM.\nSo, for the rest of this section, it suffices to focus on learning an ASPE whose revenue approximates the revenue of the ASPE described in Theorem 8.

For unit-demand bidders, there exists a collection of non-negative numbers {qij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m] satisfying \u2211 i qij \u2264 1 for all j \u2208 [m] and \u2211 j qij \u2264 1 for all i \u2208 [n], such that the optimal revenue\nOPT \u2264 4 \u00b7 \u2211\ni,j\nRDij (qij).\nProof. As shown in [11], OPT \u2264 4OPTCOPIES-UD. Let qij be the ex-ante probability that agent (i, j) is served in the optimal mechanism for the copies setting. Chawla et al. [15] showed that OPTCOPIES-UD \u2264\u2211\ni,j RDij (qij). Our statement follows from the two inequalities above.\nNext, we consider a convex program (Figure 1) and argue that the value of the optimal solution of this\nprogram is at least 18 of the optimal revenue.\nLemma 8. The optimal solution of convex program in Figure 1 is at least OPT8 .\n8This is exactly the copies setting used in [15], if every bidder i is unit-demand and has value Vi(tij) with type ti. Notice that this unit-demand multi-dimensional setting is equivalent as adding an extra constraint, each buyer can purchase at most one item, to the original setting with subadditive bidders.\nProof. Let {q\u2032ij} be the collection of nonnegative numbers in Lemma 7. Clearly, { q\u2032ij 2 } is a set of feasible\nsolution for the convex program. Since RDij (\u00b7) is concave, RDij ( q\u2032ij 2 ) \u2265 RDij (q \u2032 ij) 2 + RDij (0) 2 = RDij (q \u2032 ij) 2 . Therefore, \u2211\ni,j\nRDij ( q\u2032ij 2 ) \u2265 1 2 \u00b7 \u2211\ni,j\nRDij(q \u2032 ij) \u2265\nOPT\n8 .\nIf we know all Fij exactly, we can solve the convex program (Figure 1) and use the optimal solution to construct an SPM via an approach provided in [15, 11]. The constructed sequential posted mechanism has revenue at least 14 of the optimal value of the convex program, which is at least OPT 32 . Next, we show that with only access to F\u0302ij , we can essentially carry out the same approach. Consider a different convex program (Figure 2).\nNot that if the support size for all D\u0302ij is upper bounded by some finite number s, the convex program above can be rewritten as a linear program with size poly(n,m, s). In the following Lemma, we prove that the optimal values of the two convex programs above are close.\nLemma 9. Let {q\u2217ij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m] and {q\u0302ij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m] be the optimal solution of the convex program in Figure 1 and 2 respectively. \u2211\ni,j\nRD\u0302ij (q\u0302ij) \u2265 \u2211\ni,j\nRDij (q \u2217 ij)\u2212 \u01eb \u00b7mnH.\nProof. We first fix some notations. For any bidder i and item j, let \u00af q\u2217ij, q\u0304 \u2217 ij and xij \u2208 [0, 1] be the numbers satisfy that xij \u00b7 \u00af q\u2217ij \u00b7Fij \u22121(1\u2212 \u00af q\u2217ij)+(1\u2212xij)\u00b7 q\u0304 \u2217 ij \u00b7Fij \u22121(1\u2212 q\u0304\u2217ij) = RDij (q \u2217 ij) and xij \u00b7 \u00af q\u2217ij+(1\u2212xij)\u00b7 q\u0304 \u2217 ij = q \u2217 ij .\nLet \u00af pij = Fij \u22121(1\u2212 \u00af q\u2217ij), p\u0304ij = Fij \u22121(1\u2212 q\u0304\u2217ij), and q \u2032 ij = xij \u00b7\n( 1\u2212 F\u0302ij(\n\u00af pij)\n) + (1\u2212 xij) \u00b7 ( 1\u2212 F\u0302ij(p\u0304ij) ) .\nBy the definition of RD\u0302ij (\u00b7),\nRD\u0302ij (q \u2032 ij) \u2265 xij \u00b7\n( 1\u2212 F\u0302ij(\n\u00af pij) ) \u00b7 \u00af pij + (1\u2212 xij) \u00b7 ( 1\u2212 F\u0302ij(p\u0304ij) ) \u00b7 p\u0304ij (4)\nSince ||D\u0302ij \u2212Dij ||K \u2264 \u01eb, F\u0302ij( \u00af pij) \u2208 [1\u2212 \u00af q\u2217ij \u2212 \u01eb, 1\u2212 \u00af q\u2217ij + \u01eb] and F\u0302ij(p\u0304ij) \u2208 [1\u2212 q\u0304 \u2217 ij \u2212 \u01eb, 1\u2212 q\u0304 \u2217 ij + \u01eb]. Hence,\nthe RHS of inequality (4) is greater than RDij(q \u2217 ij)\u2212 \u01eb \u00b7H . Therefore, RD\u0302ij(q \u2032 ij) \u2265 RDij (q \u2217 ij)\u2212 \u01eb \u00b7H .\nNext, we argue that {q\u2032ij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m] is a feasible solution for the convex program in Figure 2. Since 1 \u2212\nF\u0302ij( \u00af pij) \u2264 \u00af q\u2217ij + \u01eb and 1\u2212 F\u0302ij(p\u0304ij) \u2264 q\u0304 \u2217 ij + \u01eb, q \u2032 ij \u2264 q \u2217 ij + \u01eb.

Similarly, we can prove \u2211\nj q \u2032 ij \u2264 1 2 +m \u00b7 \u01eb for all i \u2208 [n]. As {q\u0302ij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m] is the optimal solution\nfor the second convex program, \u2211 i,j RD\u0302ij (q\u0302ij) \u2265 \u2211 i,j RD\u0302ij (q \u2032 ij) \u2265 \u2211 i,j RDij(q \u2217 ij)\u2212 \u01eb \u00b7mnH .\nFinally, we show how to use the optimal solution of the convex program in Figure 2 to construct an SPM that approximates the optimal revenue well. We first provide a general transformation that turns any approximately feasible solution of convex program in Figure 1 to an SPM mechanism.\nLemma 10. For any distribution D = \u00d7i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m]Dij , given a collection of independent random variables {pij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m] such that\n\u2211\ni\u2208[n]\nPr pij ,tij\u223cDij [tij \u2265 pij] \u2264 1\u2212 \u03b71, for all j \u2208 [m]\nand \u2211\nj\u2208[m]\nPr pij ,tij\u223cDij [tij \u2265 pij] \u2264 1\u2212 \u03b72, for all i \u2208 [n],\nwe can construct in polynomial time a randomized SPM such that the revenue under D is at least\n\u03b71\u03b72 \u00b7 \u2211\ni,j\nEpij [ pij \u00b7 Pr\ntij\u223cDij [tij \u2265 pij ]\n] .\nProof. Consider a randomized SPM that sells item j to bidder i at price pij . Notice that bidder i purchases exactly item j if all of the following three conditions hold: (i) for all bidders \u2113 6= i, t\u2113j is smaller than the corresponding price p\u2113j , (ii) for all items k 6= j, tik is smaller than the corresponding price pik, and (iii) tij is greater than the corresponding price pij . These three conditions are independent from each other. The first condition holds with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u2211 \u2113 6=i Prp\u2113j ,t\u2113j\u223cD\u2113j [t\u2113j \u2265 p\u2113j] \u2265 \u03b71. The second condition holds\nwith probability at least 1\u2212 \u2211\nk 6=j Prpik,tik\u223cDik [tik \u2265 pik] \u2265 \u03b72. When the first two conditions hold, bidder i\npurchases item j whenever she can afford it. Her expected payment is Epij [ pij \u00b7 Prtij\u223cDij [tij \u2265 pij] ] . Hence,\nthe expected revenue for selling item j to bidder i is at least \u03b71\u03b72 \u00b7Epij [ pij \u00b7 Prtij\u223cDij [tij \u2265 pij] ] and the total\nexpected revenue is at least \u03b71\u03b72 \u00b7 \u2211\ni,j Epij [ pij \u00b7 Prtij\u223cDij [tij \u2265 pij ] ] .\nLemma 11. Given any feasible solution {qij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m] of the convex program in Figure 2, we can con-\nstruct a (randomized) SPM in polynomial time such that its revenue under D is at least ( 1 4 \u2212 (n+m) \u00b7 \u01eb ) \u00b7(\u2211\ni,j RD\u0302ij(qij)\u2212 \u01eb \u00b7 nmH ) .\nProof. We first fix some notations. For any bidder i and item j, let \u00af qij, q\u0304ij and xij \u2208 [0, 1] be the numbers satisfying xij \u00b7 \u00af qij \u00b7 F\u0302 \u22121 ij (1\u2212 \u00af qij)+(1\u2212xij) \u00b7 q\u0304ij \u00b7 F\u0302 \u22121 ij (1\u2212 q\u0304ij) = RD\u0302ij (qij) and xij \u00b7\u00af qij +(1\u2212xij) \u00b7 q\u0304ij = qij .\nWe use pij to denote a random variable that is \u00af pij = F\u0302\n\u22121 ij (1\u2212\n\u00af qij) with probability xij and p\u0304ij = F\u0302\n\u22121 ij (1\u2212 q\u0304ij)\nwith probability 1\u2212 xij . Next, we construct a randomized SPM based on {pij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m] according to Lemma 10. Note that\n\u2211\ni\u2208[n]\nPr pij ,tij\u223cDij\n[tij \u2265 pij] \u2264 \u2211\ni\u2208[n]\n( Pr\npij ,tij\u223cD\u0302ij\n[tij \u2265 pij ] + \u01eb\n) = \u2211\ni\u2208[n]\nqij + n\u01eb \u2264 1\n2 + 2n\u01eb\nfor all item j, and\n\u2211\nj\u2208[m]\nPr pij ,tij\u223cDij\n[tij \u2265 pij] \u2264 \u2211\nj\u2208[m]\n( Pr\npij ,tij\u223cD\u0302ij\n[tij \u2265 pij ] + \u01eb\n) = \u2211\ni\u2208[m]\nqij +m\u01eb \u2264 1\n2 + 2m\u01eb\nfor all bidder i. Hence, we can construct in polynomial time a randomized SPM with revenue at least\n( 1\n2 \u2212 2n\u01eb\n)( 1\n2 \u2212 2m\u01eb\n) \u00b7 \u2211\ni,j\nEpij [ pij \u00b7 Pr\ntij\u223cDij [tij \u2265 pij]\n]\n\u2265\n( 1\n4 \u2212 (n+m)\u01eb\n)\u2211\ni,j\nEpij [ pij \u00b7 ( Pr\ntij\u223cD\u0302ij\n[tij \u2265 pij]\u2212 \u01eb\n)]\n\u2265\n( 1\n4 \u2212 (n+m)\u01eb\n)\u2211\ni,j\n( RD\u0302ij(qij)\u2212 \u01eb \u00b7 nmH )\nThe first inequality is because \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223Dij \u2212 D\u0302ij \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 K \u2264 \u01eb, and the second inequality is because pij is upper bounded by H and Epij [ pij \u00b7 Prtij\u223cD\u0302ij [tij \u2265 pij] ] = RD\u0302ij (qij) by the definition of pij .\nTheorem 10. For unit-demand bidders, given distributions D\u0302ij where \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223D\u0302ij \u2212Dij \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 K \u2264 \u01eb for all i \u2208 [n] and j \u2208 [m], there is a polynomial time algorithm that constructs a randomized SPM whose revenue under D is at least ( 1 4 \u2212 (n +m) \u00b7 \u01eb ) \u00b7 ( OPT 8 \u2212 2\u01eb \u00b7mnH ) .\nProof. Our algorithm first computes the optimal solution {q\u0302ij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m] for the convex program in Figure 2, then constructs a randomized SPM based on {q\u0302ij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m] using Lemma 11. It is not hard to see that our algorithm runs in polynomial time. By chaining the inequalities in Lemma 8, 9 and 11, we can argue that the revenue of our mechanism is at least ( 1 4 \u2212 (n+m) \u00b7 \u01eb ) \u00b7 ( OPT 8 \u2212 2\u01eb \u00b7mnH ) .\nB.2 Unit-demand Valuations: sample access to bounded distributions\nWhen the distributions Dij are all bounded, the following theorem provides the sample complexity.\nTheorem 11. [35] WhenDij is supported on [0,H] for all bidder i and item j, the sample complexity for (\u01eb, \u03b4)-\nuniformly learning the revenue of SPMs for unit-demand bidders isO ((\n1 \u01eb )2 ( m2n log n log 1\u01eb + log 1 \u03b4 )) . That\nis, with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b4, the empirical revenue based on the samples for any SPM is within \u01eb \u00b7H of its true expected revenue. Moreover, with the same number of samples, there is a polynomial time algorithm that learns an SPM whose revenue is at least OPT144 \u2212 \u01ebH with probability 1\u2212 \u03b4.\nB.3 Unit-demand Valuations: sample access to regular distributions\nIn this section, we show there exists a polynomial time algorithm that learns an SPMwhose revenue is at least a constant fraction of the optimal revenue with polynomial in n andm samples. Note that unlike in the previous two models, the error of our learning algorithm is only multiplicative when the distributions are regular. First, we present a Lemma regarding the revenue curve function for regular distributions.\nLemma 12. [7] For any regular distribution F , let RF (\u00b7) be the corresponding revenue curve. For any 0 < q\u2032 \u2264 q \u2264 p < 1,\n(1\u2212 p) \u00b7RF (q \u2032) \u2264 RF (q).\nThroughout this section, we use Z to denote max{m,n} and C to be a constant that will be specified later. Using Lemma 12, we show in the next Lemma that restricting qij to be at least 1 CZ does not affect the objective value of the convex program in Figure 1 by too much.\nLemma 13. Suppose {q\u2217ij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m] is the optimal solution of the convex program in Figure 1. Let q \u2032 ij = max{ 1CZ , q \u2217 ij}, then \u2211 i,j RDij (q \u2032 ij) \u2265 ( 1\u2212 1CZ ) \u00b7 \u2211 i,j RDij (q \u2217 ij) \u2265 ( 1\u2212 1CZ ) \u00b7 OPT8 . Proof. According to Lemma 8, \u2211\ni,j RDij (q \u2217 ij) \u2265 OPT 8 . So to prove the statement, it suffices to argue that\nfor any i and j, RDij (q \u2032 ij) \u2265 ( 1\u2212 1CZ ) \u00b7 RDij (q \u2217 ij). If q \u2217 ij = q \u2032 ij , this inequality clearly holds. If q \u2217 ij 6= q \u2032 ij , q\u2217ij \u2264 q \u2032 ij = 1 CZ . Since Fij is regular, we can apply Lemma 12 to q \u2032 ij and q \u2217 ij and obtain inequality RDij (q \u2032 ij) \u2265(\n1\u2212 1CZ ) \u00b7RDij (q \u2217 ij).\nUsing Lemma 13, we argue how to compute in polynomial time an approximately optimal SPM. Suppose D\u2032ij is the distribution that we obtain after truncating Dij at a threshold Hij 9, and we have direct access to a\ndiscrete distribution D\u0302\u2032ij such that \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223D\u0302\u2032ij \u2212D\u2032ij \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 K \u2264 \u01eb for all i and j. We show in the following Lemma that the optimal solution of a convex program similar to the one in Figure 2 but for {D\u0302\u2032ij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m] can guide us to design an approximately optimal SPM under D in polynomial time. As we have sample access to D, we will argue later that a polynomial number of samples suffices to generate {D\u0302\u2032ij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m].\nLemma 14. Let {Hij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m] be a collection of positive numbers satisfying Fij(Hij) \u2208 [1\u2212 1 C\u00b7Z , 1\u2212 1\n3C\u00b7Z ] for all i \u2208 [n] and j \u2208 [m]. LetD\u2032ij be the distribution of the random variable min{tij,Hij} where tij \u223c Dij ,\nand D\u0302\u2032ij be a discrete distribution such that \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223D\u0302\u2032ij \u2212D\u2032ij \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 K \u2264 \u01eb for all i \u2208 [n] and j \u2208 [m]. Suppose s is an upper bound of the support size for any distribution D\u0302\u2032ij , then given direct access to D\u0302 \u2032 ij , we can\ncompute in time polynomial in n,m and s a randomized SPM that achieves revenue at least ( 1 2 \u2212 1 C \u2212 2n\u01eb ) \u00b7(\n1 2 \u2212 1 C \u2212 2m\u01eb ) \u00b7 (( 1\u2212 1CZ ) \u00b7 OPT8 \u2212 2\u01eb \u00b7 nmH ) under D, where H = maxi,j Hij .\nProof.

(5)\np\u2032ijq \u2032 ij equals to RDij(q \u2032 ij) because Dij is a regular distribution.\nNext, we argue that {q\u0303ij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m] is a feasible solution of the convex program above. Observe that\n\u2211\ni\nq\u0303ij \u2264 \u2211\ni\nq\u2032ij + n\u01eb \u2264 \u2211\ni\n( q\u2217ij + 1\nCZ\n) + n\u01eb \u2264 1\n2 +\n1 C + n\u01eb\nfor all item j \u2208 [m] and\n\u2211\nj\nq\u0303ij \u2264 \u2211\nj\nq\u2032ij + n\u01eb \u2264 \u2211\nj\n( q\u2217ij + 1\nCZ\n) +m\u01eb \u2264 1\n2 +\n1 C +m\u01eb\nfor all bidder i \u2208 [n].\nLet O\u0302PT be the optimal solution of the convex program above.

Next, we argue that with a polynomial number of samples, we can learn {Hij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m] and {D\u0302 \u2032 ij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m] with enough accuracy.\nTheorem 12. If for all bidder i and item j, Dij is a regular distribution, we can learn in polynomial time with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b4 a randomized SPM whose revenue is at least OPT33 with O ( Z2m2n2 \u00b7 log nm\u03b4 ) (Z = max{m,n}) samples. Proof. First, if we take O ( C2 \u00b7 Z2 \u00b7 log nm\u03b4 ) samples from each Dij , we can find an Hij such that Fij(Hij) lies in[1 \u2212 1CZ , 1 \u2212 1 3CZ ] with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b4 2nm . By the union bound, the probability that all Hij satisfy the requirement is at least 1 \u2212 \u03b42 . From now on, we assume Fij(Hij) \u2208 [1 \u2212 1 C\u00b7Z , 1 \u2212 1\n3C\u00b7Z ] for all i and j. Observe that OPT \u2265 maxi,j Hij \u00b7 1 3C\u00b7Z , as the expected revenue for selling item j to bidder i at price Hij is at least Hij 3C\u00b7Z . Therefore, there exists sufficiently large constant d and C , if \u01eb = 1 d\u00b7Znm the randomized SPM learned in Lemma 14 has revenue at least OPT33 . According to the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz (DKW)\ninequality [25], if we take O ( d2Z2n2m2 \u00b7 log nm\u03b4 ) samples fromD\u2032ij (we can take samples fromDij then cap the samples at Hij) and let D\u0302 \u2032 ij be the uniform distribution over the samples, \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223D\u2032ij \u2212 D\u0302\u2032ij \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 K \u2264 1d\u00b7Znm with\nprobability 1\u2212 \u03b42nm .

Finally, by another union bound, the Hij and D\u0302 \u2032 ij we learned from O ( Z2n2m2 \u00b7 log nm\u03b4 ) samples satisfy Fij(Hij) \u2208 [1\u2212 1 C\u00b7Z , 1\u2212 1 3C\u00b7Z ] and \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223D\u2032ij \u2212 D\u0302\u2032ij \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 K \u2264 1d\u00b7Znm for all i and j with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4. In other words, we can learn a randomized SPM whose revenue is at least OPT33 with probability\nat least 1 \u2212 \u03b4 using O ( Z2n2m2 \u00b7 log nm\u03b4 ) samples. Furthermore, the support size of any D\u0302\u2032ij is at most\nO ( Z2n2m2 \u00b7 log nm\u03b4 ) samples, so our learning algorithm runs in time polynomial in n and m."}, {"heading": "C Missing Details from Section 5.2", "text": "C.1 Additive Valuations: sample access to bounded distributions\nAs shown by Goldner and Karlin [28], one sample suffices to design a mechanism that approximates BREV. The idea is to use the VCG with entry fee mechanism but replace the entry fee ei(b\u2212i,Di) for bidder i with ei(b\u2212i, si) = \u2211 j\u2208[m](sij \u2212maxk 6=i bkj)\n+, where si is a sample drawn fromDi. It is easy to argue that for any b\u2212i, over the randomness of the sample si and bidder i\u2019s real type ti, the event that ei(b\u2212i, si) \u2265 ei(b\u2212i,Di) and bidder i accepts the entry fee ei(b\u2212i, si) happens with probability at least 1 8 . As 1 2 \u00b7 \u2211\ni\u2208[n] Et[ei(t\u2212i,Di)] = BREV, the expected revenue (over the randomness of the types and the samples) from their mechanism is at least 18 \u00b7 \u2211 i\u2208[n] Et[ei(t\u2212i,Di)] = BREV 4 . Next, we show how to learn a mechanism that approximates SREV.\nLemma 15. When Dij is supported on [0,H] for all bidder i and item j, the sample complexity for (\u01eb, \u03b4)-\nuniformly learning the revenue of SPMs for additive bidders is O ((\n1 \u01eb )2 ( m2n log n log 1\u01eb + log 1 \u03b4 )) . More-\nover, we can learn in polynomial time an SPM whose revenue is at least SREV4 \u2212 3\u01eb 2 \u00b7H with probability 1\u2212 \u03b4 given the same number of samples.\nProof. The first half of the Lemma was proved by Morgenstern and Roughgarden [35]. We show how to prove the second half of the claim. Let OPTj be the optimal revenue for selling item j. By the prophet inequality [41], there exists an SPM for selling item j with a collection of prices {pij}i\u2208[n] that achieves revenue at least OPTj/2. As the bidders are additive, if we run the SPMs for selling each item simultaneously, the expected revenue is exactly the sum of the revenue of the SPM mechanisms for auctioning a single item. Note that the simultaneous SPM is indeed a SPM for selling all items. Hence, there exists an SPM that achieves revenue at least OPT/2. Since the sample complexity for (\u01eb, \u03b4)-uniformly learning the revenue of\nSPMs is O ((\nm \u01eb )2 ( n log n log 1\u01eb + log 1 \u03b4 )) , the empirical revenue induced by the samples is within \u01eb \u00b7 H of\nthe true expected revenue with probability 1\u2212 \u03b4 for any SPM. We use ERopt to denote the optimal empirical revenue obtained by any SPM. If we apply the prophet inequality to the empirical distribution, we can construct an SPM whose empirical revenue ER is at least ERopt/2. Notice that ERopt is at most \u01eb \u00b7 H less than the optimal true expected revenue obtained by any SPM, which is at least OPT/2. Combining the two inequalities above, we have ER \u2265 OPT/4\u2212 \u01eb/2 \u00b7H with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b4. Also, the true expected revenue of our SPM is at least ER \u2212 \u01eb \u00b7 H , so our SPM achieves expected revenue at least OPT4 \u2212 3\u01eb 2 \u00b7H with probability 1\u2212 \u03b4.\nNow we are ready to prove our Theorem for additive bidders when their valuations are bounded.\nTheorem 13. When the bidders have additive valuations and Dij is supported on [0,H] for all bidder i and item j, we can learn in polynomial time a mechanism whose expected revenue is at least OPT32 \u2212 \u01eb \u00b7 H with probability 1\u2212 \u03b4 given\nO ((m \u01eb )2 \u00b7 ( n log n log 1 \u01eb + log 1 \u03b4 ))\nsamples from D.\nProof. According to Lemma 15, we can learn a mechanism whose revenue is at least SREV4 \u2212 \u01eb 24 \u00b7 H with\nprobability 1\u2212 \u03b4 given O ((\nm \u01eb )2 \u00b7 ( n log n log 1\u01eb + log 1 \u03b4 )) samples. As we explained in the beginning of this\nsection, with one sample from the distribution we can construct a randomized mechanism whose expected revenue is at least BREV4 . Therefore, the better of our two mechanisms has expected revenue at least OPT 32 \u2212 \u01eb \u00b7H with probability 1\u2212 \u03b4.\nC.2 Additive Valuations: direct access to approximate distributions\nIn this section, we discuss how to learn an approximately optimal mechanism for additive bidders when we are given direct access to approximate value distributions. Again, we first show how to learn a mechanism whose revenue approximates SREV then we provide another mechanism whose revenue approximates BREV. Lemma 16. For additive bidders, given distributions D\u0302ij where \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223D\u0302ij \u2212Dij\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 K \u2264 \u01eb for all i \u2208 [n] and\nj \u2208 [m], there is a polynomial time algorithm that constructs a randomized SPM whose revenue under D is at least ( 1 4 \u2212 \u01eb \u00b7 n ) \u00b7 ( SREV 8 \u2212 2\u01eb \u00b7mnH ) .\nProof. Let OPTj be the optimal revenue for selling item j. As the bidders are additive, if we can construct a randomized SPM Mj for every item j such that its expected revenue under D is at least ( 1 4 \u2212 \u01eb \u00b7 n ) \u00b7\n( OPTj 8 \u2212 2\u01eb \u00b7 nH ) , running these m randomized SPMs in parallel generates expected revenue at least\n\u2211\nj\u2208[m]\n( 1\n4 \u2212 \u01eb \u00b7 n\n) \u00b7 ( OPTj\n8 \u2212 2\u01eb \u00b7 nH\n) = ( 1\n4 \u2212 \u01eb \u00b7 n\n) \u00b7 ( SREV\n8 \u2212 2\u01eb \u00b7mnH\n)\nunder D. Due to Theorem 10, we can construct in polynomial time such a randomized SPMMj for each item j based on \u00d7i\u2208[n]D\u0302ij .\nNext, we show how to choose the entry fee based on D\u0302 = \u00d7i,jD\u0302ij , so that the VCG with entry fee mechanism has revenue that approximates BREV under the true distribution D. More specifically, we use the median of i\u2019s utility under D\u0302i = \u00d7j\u2208[m]D\u0302ij as bidder i\u2019s entry fee. We prove the result in two steps. We first show that if we can use an entry fee function such that every bidder i accepts her entry fee with probability between [1/2 \u2212 \u03b7, 1/2] for any possible bid profiles b\u2212i of the other bidders, the expected revenue is at least (1/2 \u2212 \u03b7) \u00b7 BREV. Second, we show how to compute in polynomial time such entry fee functions with \u03b7 = O(m\u01eb) based on D\u0302.\nLemma 17. Suppose for every bidder i, di(\u00b7) : T\u2212i 7\u2192 R is a randomized entry fee function such that for any bid profile b\u2212i \u2208 T\u2212i of the other bidders\nPr ti\u223cDi\n  \u2211\nj\u2208[m]\n( tij \u2212max\nk 6=i bkj\n)+ \u2265 di(b\u2212i)   \u2208 [ 1\n2 \u2212 \u03b7,\n1\n2\n]\nwith probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4. Then if we use di(\u00b7) as the entry fee function in the VCG with entry fee mechanism, the expected revenue is at least (1\u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 2\u03b7) \u00b7 BREV.\nProof. When Prti\u223cDi [\u2211 j\u2208[m] (tij \u2212maxk 6=i bkj) + \u2265 di(b\u2212i) ] \u2208 [ 1 2 \u2212 \u03b7, 1 2 ] , di(b\u2212i) is no less than the original entry fee ei(b\u2212i,Di) for any bid profile b\u2212i of the other bidders. The expected revenue under the new entry fee functions is at least ((1\u2212 \u03b4) \u00b7 ( 1 2 \u2212 \u03b7 ) \u00b7 \u2211 i\u2208[n] Eb\u2212i\u223cD\u2212i [ei(b\u2212i,Di)] \u2265 (1\u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 2\u03b7) \u00b7 BREV.\nLemma 18. For any bidder i and any bid profile b\u2212i from the other bidders, let Fi,b\u2212i and F\u0302i,b\u2212i be the distri-\nbutions for the random variable \u2211\nj\u2208[m] (tij \u2212maxk 6=i bkj) + when ti is drawn from Di and D\u0302i respectively.\nIf \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223Dij \u2212 D\u0302ij \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 K \u2264 \u01eb for all bidder i and item j, \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223Fi,b\u2212i \u2212 F\u0302i,b\u2212i \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 K \u2264 2m\u01eb for all i and b\u2212i. Moreover, when m\u01eb \u2264 1/16, we can compute a randomized mechanism whose expected revenue is at least BREV5 . Proof. For any real number x, consider event Ei,b\u2212i,x = { ti \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2211 j\u2208[m] (tij \u2212maxk 6=i bkj) + \u2265 x } . It is easy to see that Ei,b\u2212i,x is single-intersecting for any any i, b\u2212i and x. According to Lemma 3, \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 Prti\u223cDi [ Ei,b\u2212i,x ] \u2212 Pr\nti\u223cD\u0302i\n[ Ei,b\u2212i,x ]\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 2m\u01eb\nfor any i, b\u2212i and x. Hence, \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223Fi,b\u2212i \u2212 F\u0302i,b\u2212i \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 K \u2264 2m\u01eb.\nNext, we argue how to construct a randomized entry fee di(b\u2212i) in polynomial time with only sample access of F\u0302i,b\u2212i . Suppose we take k samples from F\u0302i,b\u2212i and sort them in descending order s1 \u2265 s2 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 sk. Let the entry fee di(b\u2212i) to be s\u23085k16 \u2309 . By the Chernoff bound, with probability at least 1\u2212 exp(\u2212k/128) (over the randomness of the samples) Prti\u223cD\u0302i [\u2211 j\u2208[m] (tij \u2212maxk 6=i bkj) + \u2265 di(b\u2212i) ] = Prti\u223cD\u0302i [ Ei,b\u2212i,di(b\u2212i) ]\nlies in [ 1 4 , 3 8 ] . Since Prti\u223cDi [ Ei,b\u2212i,di(b\u2212i) ] = Prti\u223cD\u0302i [ Ei,b\u2212i,di(b\u2212i) ] \u00b1 2m\u01eb,\nPr ti\u223cDi\n[ Ei,b\u2212i,di(b\u2212i) ] \u2208 [ 1\n8 , 1 2 ],\nif m\u01eb \u2264 1/16. According to Lemma 17, the expected revenue under our entry fee di(b\u2212i) is at least( 1 4 \u2212 exp(\u2212k/128) ) \u00b7 BREV \u2265 BREV5 if we choose k to be larger than some absolute constant. Clearly, the procedure above can be completed in polynomial time with access to D\u0302.\nCombining Lemma 16 and 18, we are ready to prove our main result of this section.\nTheorem 14.

As OPT \u2264 6 \u00b7 SREV + 2BREV (Theorem 6), the better of the two mechanisms we can learn in polynomial time has revenue at least OPT266 \u2212 96\u01eb \u00b7mnH ."}, {"heading": "D Missing Details from Section 6", "text": "Proof of Lemma 5: We only sketch the proof here.

Both SINGLE and TAIL are within constant times the POSTREV, and the ASPE(p\u2217, \u03b4\u2217) is used to bound the CORE.

For any fixed {pj}j\u2208[m], fixed bidder i and fixed set S, it is easy to argue that the probability for Prti\u223cDi [ui(ti, S) \u2265 \u03b4 (p) i (S)] to be larger than 1 2 + \u00b5 or smaller than 1 2 \u2212 \u00b5 is at most 2exp(\u22122K\u00b5\n2) due to the Chernoff bound.

We use S to denote the set that contains ASPE(p, \u03b4(p)) for every p in the B-bounded \u01eb-net.

For any {pj}j\u2208[m] in the \u01eb-net, define REV(p) to be the expected revenue of ASPE(p, \u03b4 (p)) and R\u0302EV(p) be the average revenue of ASPE(p, \u03b4(p)) among the K samples. First, we argue that R\u0302EV(p) is a random variable that lies between [0,mnB]. The revenue from selling the items can be at most mB as there are only m items and pj \u2264 B for all j \u2208 [m]. How about the entry fee? For any bidder i,\nPr ti\u223cDi\n[vi(ti, [m]) \u2265 mG] \u2264 \u2211\nj\u2208[m]\nPr tij\u223cDij\n[Vi(tij) \u2265 G] \u2264 m\n5max{m,n} \u2264\n1 5 .\nThe first inequality is because vi(ti, \u00b7) is a subadditive function for every type ti \u2208 Ti, so for vi(ti, [m]) to be greater than mG, there must exist a item j such that Vi(tij) \u2265 G. The second inequality follows from the definition of G in Theorem 8.\nIf there exists a set S \u2286 [m] such that \u03b4 (p) i (S) > mG, we have\nPr ti\u223cDi [vi(ti, [m]) \u2265 mG] \u2265 Pr ti\u223cDi\n[ vi(ti, [m]) \u2265 \u03b4 (p) i (S) ] \u2265 1\n2 \u2212 \u00b5 \u2265\n1 4 .\nContradiction. Note that the second inequality is because \u03b4 (p) i (\u00b7) is \u00b5-balanced. Hence, the entry fee is always upper bounded by mG and R\u0302EV(p) is at most mnG + mB \u2264 mnB. Also, notice that the expectation of R\u0302EV(p) is exactly REV(p). By the Chernoff bound,\nPr [\u2223\u2223\u2223REV(p)\u2212 R\u0302EV(p) \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 mnB \u00b7 \u01eb\u2032 ] \u2265 1\u2212 2 exp(\u22122K \u00b7 \u01eb\u20322)\nfor any fixed {pj}j\u2208[m]. By the union bound, the probability that for all {pj}j\u2208[m] in the \u01eb-net \u2223\u2223\u2223REV(p)\u2212 R\u0302EV(p) \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 mnB \u00b7 \u01eb\u2032 is at least 1\u2212 2 exp(\u22122K \u00b7 \u01eb\u20322) \u00b7 ( B \u01eb )m , which is lower bounded by 1\u2212 \u03b7 due to our choice of K . When this happens, the expected revenue of ASPE(p\u2032, \u03b4(p \u2032)) is at most 2mnB \u00b7 \u01eb\u2032 less than the highest expected revenue achievable by any of these mechanisms, because\nREV(p\u2032) \u2265 R\u0302EV(p\u2032)\u2212mnB \u00b7 \u01eb\u2032 \u2265 R\u0302EV(p)\u2212mnB \u00b7 \u01eb\u2032 \u2265 REV(p)\u2212 2mnB \u00b7 \u01eb\u2032\nfor any p in the \u01eb-net. Combining this inequality with Corollary 2 completes our proof.\nNote that Lemma 19 and 20 hold for all distributions D. The reason we require D to be bounded or regular is because without these restrictions, we do not know how to approximate the best RSPM. In the following Theorem, we combine Lemma 19, 20 and Theorem 11 to obtain the sample complexity of our learning algorithm for bounded distributions.\nTheorem 15. When all bidders\u2019 valuations are XOS over independent items and the random variable Vi(tij)\nis supported on [0,H] for any bidder i and any item j, with O (( mn \u03be )2 \u00b7 ( m \u00b7 log m+n\u03be + log 1 \u03b4 )) samples\nfrom D, we can learn an RSPM and an ASPE such that with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4 the better of the two mechanisms has revenue at least OPTc \u2212 \u03be \u00b7H for some absolute constant c > 1.\nProof. With O (( 1 \u03be )2 ( m2n log n log 1\u03be + log 1 \u03b4 )) samples, we can obtain an RSPM whose revenue is at\nleast 124 of the revenue of the best RSPM minus \u03be 2 \u00b7 H with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b4/2 according to Theorem 11. Let \u00b5 be some fixed constant in [0, 14 ], B = 2H , \u01eb = \u03be\u00b7H 6C2(\u00b5)(m+n) and \u01eb\u2032 = \u03be12mn . According to Lemma 19,\ngiven O ( log 1\u03b4 + log n+m log m+n \u03be ) samples, we can construct an entry fee function for each price vector in the B-bounded \u01eb-net, such that all these entry fee functions are \u00b5-balanced with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4/4.\nAccording to Lemma 20, we can learn an ASPE with O (( mn \u03be )2 \u00b7 ( m \u00b7 log m+n\u03be + log 1 \u03b4 )) fresh samples\nfrom D, such that the better of the ASPE we learned and the best RSPM has revenue of at least OPTC1(\u00b5) \u2212 \u03be 2 \u00b7H with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b4/4.

When all bidders\u2019 valuations are XOS over independent items and the random variable Vi(tij) is regular for each item j \u2208 [m] and bidder i \u2208 [n], with O ( Z2m2n2 \u00b7 ( m \u00b7 log(m+ n) + log 1\u03b4 )) (Z = max{m,n}) samples from D, we can learn an RSPM and an ASPE such that with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4 the better of the two mechanisms has revenue at least OPTc for some absolute constant c > 1.\nProof. According to Theorem 12, we can learn with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b4/2 a randomized RSPM whose revenue is at least 133 of the optimal RSPM with O ( Z2m2n2 \u00b7 log nm\u03b4 ) samples. Next, we learn an ASPE with high\nrevenue. With O ( Z2 \u00b7 log nm\u03b4 ) samples from each Dij , we can estimate Wij such that\nPr tij\u223cDij [Vi(tij) \u2265 Wij] \u2208\n[ 1\n6Z , 1 5Z\n]\nwith probability 1 \u2212 \u03b44nm . By the union bound, the probability that all Wij satisfy the requirement is at least 1\u2212 \u03b44 . So with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4 4 ,Wij \u2265 Gij for all i \u2208 [n] and j \u2208 [m].\nLetB = 2 \u00b7maxi,j Wij , \u00b5 be some fixed constant in [0, 1 4 ], \u01eb = \u03be\u00b7B C2(\u00b5)Z(m+n) and \u01eb\u2032 = \u03be2mnZ for some small\nconstant \u03be, which will be specified later. We know that given O ( log 1\u03b4 + log n+m log(m+ n) ) samples, we can construct \u00b5-balanced entry fee functions for all price vectors in the B-bounded \u01eb-net with probability 1\u2212 \u03b4/8 due to Lemma 19. According to Lemma 20, we can learn an ASPE with\nO ( Z2m2n2 \u00b7 ( m \u00b7 log(m+ n) + log 1\n\u03b4\n))\nfresh samples from D, such that the better of the ASPE we learned and the best RSPM has revenue of at least OPT C1(\u00b5) \u2212 2\u03be\u00b7BZ with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b4/8.

Combining the statements above, we can learn with probability 1\u2212 \u03b4 a mechanism whose revenue is at least OPTc for some absolute constant c with O ( Z2m2n2 \u00b7 ( m \u00b7 log(m+ n) + log 1\u03b4 )) samples."}, {"heading": "E Learning Algorithms for Symmetric Bidders", "text": ""}, {"heading": "E.1 An Upper Bound of the Optimal Revenue for Symmetric Bidders", "text": "In this section, we introduce an upper bound to OPT based on duality [13], which is crucial for us to prove the approximation ratios of our learning algorithms. We first fix some notation. Let POSTREV be the highest revenue obtainable by any RSPM. As the bidders are symmetric, we drop the subscript i when there is no confusion. In particular, we use V (tij) to denote bidder i\u2019s value for winning item j if her private information for item j is tij , and v(ti, S) to denote bidder i\u2019s value for set S when her type is ti. We use Dj to denote the distribution of the private information about item j. Let \u03c3iS(t) be the interim probability for bidder i to receive exactly set S \u2286 [m] when her type is t.\nIn [13], an upper bound of the optimal revenue is derived using duality theory. Their upper bound applies to asymmetric bidders with valuations that are subadditive over independent items. When the bidders are symmetric, we can simplify their upper bound. First, we need the definition of b-balanced thresholds.\nDefinition 7 (b-balanced Thresholds). For any constant b \u2208 (0, 1), a collection of positive real numbers {\u03b2j}j\u2208[m] is b-balanced if for all i \u2208 [n] and j \u2208 [m], Prtij\u223cDj [V (tij) \u2265 \u03b2j ] \u2208 [ b n , b n\u22121 ].\nNote that when bidders are asymmetric, b-balanced thresholds are not guaranteed to exist, as there may not exist any \u03b2j that satisfies Prtij\u223cDj [V (tij) \u2265 \u03b2j ] \u2208 [ b n , b n\u22121 ] for all bidder i simultaneously. Next, we define the CORE\u03b7(\u03b2) which will be crucial for upper bounding the optimal revenue. 10 Definition 8 (CORE). Given any collection of thresholds {\u03b2j}j\u2208[n] and a nonnegative constant \u03b7 \u2264 1 4 ,\n\u2022 if \u2211\nj\u2208[m]Prtj\u223cDj [V (tj) \u2265 \u03b2j ] \u2264 1 2 \u2212 \u03b7, let c\u03b7(\u03b2) be 0;\n\u2022 otherwise, let c\u03b7(\u03b2) be a nonnegative number such that \u2211 j\u2208[m]Prtj\u223cDj [V (tj) \u2265 \u03b2j + c\u03b7(\u03b2)] \u2208 [ 1 2 \u2212 \u03b7, 1 2 ] .\nFor every type t, let C\u03b7(t) = {j | V (tj) < \u03b2j + c\u03b7(\u03b2)}.

That is, CORE\u03b7(\u03b2) is the maximum welfare a mechanism can extract out of the allocation of items whose individual value for the bidder they are allocated to is lower than the adjusted thresholds.\nIt was shown in [13] that every collection of thresholds induces an upper bound to the optimal revenue. In particular, for any choice of thresholds {\u03b2j}j\u2208[m] and \u03b7 11, the revenue REV(M) of any BIC mechanism M is upper bounded by\n2 \u00b7 SINGLE(M,\u03b2) + 4 \u00b7 TAIL\u03b7(M,\u03b2) + 4 \u00b7 CORE\u03b7(M,\u03b2) (Adapted from Theorem 2 in [13]).\nThese terms depend on the choice of {\u03b2j}j\u2208[m], \u03b7 as well as the mechanism M . We refer interested readers to [13] for the definitions of these terms. To obtain a benchmark/upper bound of the optimal revenue, one can simply replace the above expression with\n2 \u00b7max M SINGLE(M,\u03b2) + 4 \u00b7max M TAIL\u03b7(M,\u03b2) + 4 \u00b7max M CORE\u03b7(M,\u03b2).\n10For readers that are familiar with the definition of the CORE in [13], CORE\u03b7(\u03b2) is essentially the same term but adapted for symmetric bidders.\n11In [13], the thresholds are allowed to depend on the identity of the bidder. More specifically, for any i \u2208 [n] and j \u2208 [m], there is an associated threshold \u03b2ij . Their upper bound applies to asymmetric thresholds as well. Indeed, when the bidders are asymmetric, their upper bound is induced by a set of asymmetric thresholds. As we only discuss symmetric bidders in this section, we focus on symmetric thresholds for simplicity. Regarding \u03b7, Cai and Zhao only considered the case when \u03b7 = 0, but their analysis can be easily modified to accommodate any \u03b7 \u2264 1/4. See Theorem 17 for the modified upper bound.\nIt is not hard to see that this benchmark may be impossible to approximate for certain choices of the thresholds. Just imagine the case when the thresholds are extremely high, thenmaxM CORE\u03b7(M,\u03b2) becomes the optimal social welfare which can be arbitrarily large comparing to the optimal revenue. What Cai and Zhao [13] showed was that when the thresholds are b-balanced, this upper bound can indeed be approximated by the revenue of an RSPM and an ASPE. From now on, we only consider b-balanced thresholds.\nUsing results in [13], we can further simplify the benchmark. In particular, maxM SINGLE(M,\u03b2) is less than 6 \u00b7 POSTREV for all choices of {\u03b2j}j\u2208[n] and maxM TAIL\u03b7(M,\u03b2) is less than 2 1\u2212b \u00b7 POSTREV for any choice of \u03b7 and b-balanced thresholds {\u03b2j}j\u2208[n]. Moreover, maxM CORE\u03b7(M,\u03b2) \u2264 CORE\u03b7(\u03b2). Combining the inequalities above, we obtain the following Theorem.\nTheorem 17 (Adapted from [13]). When the bidders are symmetric and have valuations that are subadditive over independent items, for any constant b \u2208 (0, 1), \u03b7 \u2264 14 and a collection of b-balanced thresholds {\u03b2j}j\u2208[m],\nOPT \u2264 ( 12 + 8\n1\u2212 b\n) \u00b7 POSTREV + 4 \u00b7 CORE\u03b7(\u03b2)."}, {"heading": "E.2 Symmetric Bidders with XOS Valuations", "text": "In this section, we show how to learn in polynomial time an approximately optimal mechanism for symmetric bidders with XOS valuations given sample access to the distributions.

From Section 5.1, we know how to approximated POSTREV in polynomial time, so we focus on learning a mechanism whose revenue approximates CORE\u03b7(\u03b2). First, we need a crucial property about XOS valuations.\nLemma 21 (Supporting Prices [23]).

The CORE\u03b7(\u03b2) is exactly the maximum expected social welfare if every bidder i\u2019s valuation is drawn independently from Fi.

As showed by Feige [27], there exists a polynomial time algorithm that achieves 1\u2212 1e fraction of the optimal social welfare when bidders have XOS valuations. We let \u03c3\u2217 be the interim allocation rule induced by Feige\u2019s algorithm and estimate the prices by running Feige\u2019s algorithm on sampled valuation profiles. To run Feige\u2019s algorithm, we need a demand oracle for bidder\u2019s valuations. In the following Lemma, we argue that v\u2032(t, \u00b7) is an XOS function for any type t, and given a value (or demand, XOS) oracle for v(t, \u00b7), we can construct in polynomial time the corresponding oracle for v\u2032(t, \u00b7). First, we define these oracles formally.\nDefinition 9. We consider the following three oracles for a bidder\u2019s valuation function v(t, \u00b7):\n\u2022 Value oracle: takes a set S \u2286 [m] as the input and returns v(t, S).\n\u2022 Demand oracle: takes a collection of prices {pj}j\u2208[m] as an input and returns the favorite set under these prices, that is, S\u2217 \u2208 argmaxS\u2208[m] v(t, S)\u2212 \u2211 j\u2208S pj .\n\u2022 XOS oracle (only when v(t, \u00b7) is XOS): takes a set S \u2286 [m] as the input and returns the supporting prices {\u03b8Sj (t)}j\u2208S for v(t, S).\nLemma 25. Given a collection of thresholds {\u03b2j}j\u2208[m] and c\u03b7(\u03b2). For any set S \u2286 [m], let v \u2032(t, S) = v(t, S \u2229 C\u03b7(t)). If v(t, \u00b7) is an XOS function, v \u2032(t, \u00b7) is also an XOS function. Given a value (or demand, XOS) oracle for v(t, \u00b7), we can construct in polynomial time a value (or demand, XOS) oracle for v\u2032(t, \u00b7).\nProof. If v(t, \u00b7) is an XOS function, v(t, \u00b7) can be represented as the max of a collection of additive functions. Observe that if we change the values for items in C\u03b7(t) to 0 in each of these additive functions, v\n\u2032(t, \u00b7) equals to the max of this new collection of additive functions. Hence, v\u2032(t, \u00b7) is also an XOS function.\nIf we are given a value oracle for v(t, \u00b7), it is straightforward to construct a value oracle for v\u2032(t, \u00b7). If we are given a demand oracle for v(t, \u00b7), here is how to construct a demand oracle for v\u2032(t, \u00b7). For every queried price vector {pj}j\u2208[m], we change the price for each item outside C\u03b7(t) to 2v(t, [m]) and keep the prices for the items in C\u03b7(t). Let this new price vector be p\n\u2032. We query the demand oracle of v(t, \u00b7) on p\u2032. The output set should also be the demand set for v\u2032(t, \u00b7) under prices p, as the bidder can only afford items in C\u03b7(t) and v \u2032(t, S) = v(t, S) for any set S \u2286 C\u03b7(t). Finally, we consider the XOS oracle. For any set S,\nlet { \u03b8 S\u2229C\u03b7(t) j (t) } j\u2208S\u2229C\u03b7(t) be the supporting prices for v(t, S \u2229 C\u03b7(t)). Let \u03b3 S j (t) = \u03b8 S\u2229C\u03b7(t) j for all item j in C\u03b7(t) \u2229 S and \u03b3 S j (t) = 0 for all item j in S \u2212 C\u03b7(t). According to the definition of v\n\u2032(t, \u00b7), {\u03b3Sj (t)}j\u2208S is the supporting price for v\u2032(t, S). So given an XOS oracle for v(t, \u00b7), we can compute the supporting price of any set S for v\u2032(t, \u00b7) in polynomial time.\nLemma 25 shows that v\u2032(t, \u00b7) is also an XOS function for any type t and with access to a demand oracle for v(t, \u00b7) we can construct a demand oracle for v\u2032(t, \u00b7) in polynomial time. So we can indeed run Feige\u2019s algorithm on v\u2032. In the next Lemma, we show how to learn a collection of prices {Qj}j\u2208[m] and entry fee function \u03b4(\u00b7, \u00b7) such that the corresponding ASPE has high revenue.\nLemma 26. Given a collection of b-balanced thresholds {\u03b2j}j\u2208[m] and c\u03b7(\u03b2), and access to value, demand and XOS oracles for valuation v(t, \u00b7) for every type t, there is a polynomial time algorithm that learns an ASPE({Qj}j\u2208[m], \u03b4) whose revenue is at least CORE\u03b7(\u03b2)\nK1 \u2212 g(b, \u03b7) \u00b7 POSTREV \u2212K2 \u00b7 \u03be \u00b7 OPT with probability\nat least 1\u2212 \u03b6 using O ( n3(m+ n)2 log m\u03b6 ) samples from \u00d7j\u2208[m]Dj , where K1 and K2 are positive absolute constants, and g(b, \u03b7) is a function that only depends on b and \u03b7.\nProof. According to Lemma 25, we can construct value, demand and XOS oracles for valuation v\u2032(t, \u00b7) given access to the corresponding oracles for v(t, \u00b7). We use {\u03b3Sj (t)}j\u2208S to denote the output of the XOS oracle for v\u2032(t, \u00b7) on set S. In particular, \u03b3Sj (t) = 0 for all j \u2208 S \u2212 C\u03b7(t) and \u03b3 S j (t) = \u03b8 S\u2229C\u03b7(t) j (t) for all j \u2208 S \u2229 C\u03b7(t), where {\u03b8 S\u2229C\u03b7(t) j (t)}j\u2208S\u2229C\u03b7(t) is the supporting prices for v(t, S \u2229 C\u03b7(t)). LetA(t) be the allocation computed by Feige\u2019s algorithm on the valuation profile (v\u2032(t1, \u00b7), . . . , v \u2032(tn, \u00b7)), whereAi(t) denotes the set of items that bidder i receives. Let \u03c3\u2217 be the interim allocation rule induced by A(\u00b7) when bidders types are all drawn from \u00d7j\u2208[m]Dj independently. That is, \u03c3 \u2217 iS(ti) = Prt\u2212i [Ai(t) = S]. We use the same definition for Q\u03b7,j as in Lemma 22. In other words, Q\u03b7,j is the contribution of item j to the social welfare under allocation rule \u03c3 \u2217, so we can rewrite it as\n1 2 \u00b7 Et\n \u2211\ni\u2208[n]\n1 [j \u2208 Ai(t)] \u00b7 \u03b3 Ai(t) j (ti)\n  .\nLet t(1), . . . , t(K) be K sampled type profiles, and q(\u2113) = 12 \u2211 i\u2208[n] 1 [ j \u2208 Ai(t (\u2113)) ] \u00b7 \u03b3 Ai(t(\u2113)) j (t (\u2113) i ). We\nset Qj to be 1 K \u00b7 \u2211 \u2113\u2208[K] q\n(\u2113). Since \u03b3Sj (t) \u2264 \u03b2j + c\u03b7(\u03b2) for any j, S and t, Qj \u2264 \u03b2j + c\u03b7(\u03b2). By the Chernoff bound,\nPr [|Qj \u2212Q\u03b7,j | \u2264 \u01eb \u00b7 (\u03b2j + c\u03b7(\u03b2))] \u2265 1\u2212 2 exp(\u22122K \u00b7 \u01eb 2).\nAs {\u03b2j}j\u2208[m] is a collection of b-balanced thresholds, we can obtain revenue \u03b2j \u00b7 b n by only selling\nitem j to one bidder at price \u03b2j . Hence, \u03b2j \u2264 n\u00b7OPT\nb . Now, consider a posted price mechanism that\nsells item j at price \u03b2j + c\u03b7(\u03b2). A single bidder will purchase at least one item with probability at least\u2211 j Prtj\u223cDj [V (tj) \u2265 \u03b2j + c\u03b7(\u03b2)] which is no less than 1 2 \u2212 \u03b7 if c\u03b7(\u03b2) > 0. Hence, the revenue of this mech-\nanism is at least c\u03b7(\u03b2) \u00b7 ( 1 2 \u2212 \u03b7 ) . As \u03b7 \u2264 14 , c\u03b7(\u03b2) \u2264 4OPT. If we let \u01eb = \u03be (m+n)\u00b7(n/b+4) for some small constant \u03be which will be specified later and K = log 4m \u03b6 2\u01eb2 , we have Pr [ |Qj \u2212Q\u03b7,j| \u2264 \u03be m+n \u00b7 OPT ] \u2265 1\u2212 \u03b62m . In other words, with O ( n3(m+ n)2 log m\u03b6 ) samples from \u00d7j\u2208[m]Dj (as each t \u2113 costs n samples), we can learn in polynomial time a collection of prices {Qj}j\u2208[m] such that |Qj \u2212Q\u03b7,j | \u2264 \u03be\nm+n \u00b7 OPT for all item j with probability 1\u2212 \u03b6/2.\nNext, we consider the entry fee function. We use essentially the same argument as in Lemma 19. Suppose we take L samples t(1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , t(L) from \u00d7j\u2208[m]Dj . Define the entry fee \u03b4(S) for set S under {Qj}j\u2208[m] to be the median of u(t(1), S), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , u(t(L), S), where u(t, S) = maxS\u2217\u2286S v(t, S \u2217)\u2212 \u2211 j\u2208S\u2217 pj . Given any constant \u00b5 \u2208 [0, 1/4], for any fixed set S, it is easy to argue that the probability for Prt\u223c\u00d7j\u2208[m]Dj [u(t, S) \u2265 \u03b4(S)] to be larger than 12 + \u00b5 or less than 1 2 \u2212 \u00b5 is at most 2 exp(\u22122L\u00b5 2) due to the Chernoff bound. If we let L to be a \u00b7 m+log 1/\u03b6 \u00b52 for a sufficiently large constant a, the probability that \u03b4(\u00b7) is a \u00b5-balanced entry fee function is at least 1\u2212 \u03b6/2 by the union bound.\nHence, with O ( n3(m+ n)2 log m\u03b6 ) samples from \u00d7j\u2208[m]Dj , we can compute in polynomial time a col-\nlection of prices {Qj}j\u2208[m] and a entry fee function \u03b4(\u00b7) such that the revenue of the ASPE ( {Qj}j\u2208[m], \u03b4(\u00b7) ) is at least (1\u22121/e)\u00b7CORE\u03b7(\u03b2)\nB1(\u00b5) \u2212B2(b, \u03b7, \u00b5) \u00b7POSTREV \u2212 \u03be \u00b7 B3(\u00b5) \u00b7OPT with probability 1\u2212 \u03b6 due to Lemma 23.\nOur claim follows by fixing the value of \u00b5 to be some constant.\nTheorem 18.

Note that this argument only applies to symmetric bidders, as b-balanced thresholds may not even exist for asymmetric bidders.\nWe set \u03b7 = 0 for this section and drop the subscript \u03b7 when there is no confusion. We show how to upper bound CORE(\u03b2) with POSTREV by choosing a particular collection of b-balanced thresholds. Let Z = max{m,n} and b = n3Z .

The next Lemma connects RSPMs with SPMs in an induced unit-demand setting.\nLemma 29. Consider n symmetric bidders whose types are drawn independently from \u00d7mj=1Dj . Let Fj be the distribution for random variable V (tj) where tj \u223c Dj . We define an induced unit-demand setting with n symmetric unit-demand bidders whose values for item j are drawn independently from Fj . For any collection of prices {pij}i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m], the revenue of the RSPM with these prices in the original setting is exactly the same as the revenue of the SPM with these prices in the induced unit-demand setting.\nProof. As in an RSPM bidders can purchase at most one item, bidders behave exactly the same as in the induced unit-demand setting. Since the prices in the SPM and RSPM are the same, bidders purchase exactly the same items. Hence, the revenue is the same.\nCorollary 3. For symmetric bidders with valuations that are subadditive over independent items,\nOPTUD \u2265 \u2126 ( n Z ) \u00b7 OPT,\nwhere Z = max{m,n} and OPTUD is the optimal revenue for the induced unit-demand setting.\nProof.

Next, we apply our results in Section 5.1 to the induced unit-demand setting to learn an RSMP that approximates the optimal revenue in the original setting.\nIn the next Theorem, we show that even though the bidders\u2019 valuations could be complex set functions, e.g., submodular, XOS and subadditive, as long asm = O(n), the approximate distributions for the bidders\u2019 values for winning any single item provides sufficient information to learn an approximately optimal mechanism.\nTheorem 20. For symmetric bidders with valuations that are subadditive over independent items, let Fj be the distribution of V (tj) where tj \u223c Dj . If Fj is supported on [0,H] for all j \u2208 [m], given distributions F\u0302j\nwhere \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223F\u0302j \u2212Fj \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 K \u2264 \u01eb for all j \u2208 [m], there is a polynomial time algorithm that constructs a randomized RSPM whose revenue under the true distribution D is at least ( 1\n4 \u2212 (n+m) \u00b7 \u01eb\n) \u00b7 ( \u2126 ( n\nmax{m,n}\n) \u00b7 OPT\u2212 2\u01eb \u00b7mnH ) .\nProof. Let Z = max{m,n}. According to Corollary 3, OPTUD = \u2126 ( n Z ) \u00b7 OPT. Since ||F\u0302j \u2212 Fj ||K \u2264 \u01eb for all j \u2208 [m], we can learn a randomized SPM in the induced unit-demand setting whose revenue under the true distribution is at least ( 1 4 \u2212 (n+m) \u00b7 \u01eb ) \u00b7 ( OPTUD 8 \u2212 2\u01eb \u00b7mnH ) based on Theorem 10.

For symmetric bidders with valuations that are subadditive over independent items, let Fj be the distribution of V (tj) where tj \u223c Dj . If Fj is supported on [0,H] for all j \u2208 [m], there is a polynomial\ntime algorithm that learns an RSPM whose revenue is \u2126 (\nn max{m,n}\n) \u00b7OPT\u2212 \u01ebH with probability 1\u2212 \u03b4 using\nO\n(( 1\n\u01eb\n)2 \u00b7 ( m2n log n log 1\n\u01eb + log\n1\n\u03b4\n))\nsamples. Proof. According to Corollary 3, OPTUD = \u2126 (\nn max{m,n}\n) \u00b7 OPT. Due to Theorem 11,\nO\n(( 1\n\u01eb\n)2 \u00b7 ( m2n log n log 1\n\u01eb + log\n1\n\u03b4\n))\nsamples suffices to learn in polynomial time with probability 1\u2212\u03b4 an SPMwith revenue at least \u2126(OPTUD)\u2212 \u01eb \u00b7H for the induced unit-demand setting. By Lemma 29, we can construct an RSPM with the same collection\nof prices and achieve revenue \u2126 (\nn max{m,n}\n) \u00b7 OPT\u2212 \u01ebH in the original setting.\nFinally, if the distribution of the random variable V (tj) with tj \u223c Dj is regular for all item j \u2208 [m], we prove in the next theorem that there exists a prior-independent mechanism that achieves a constant fraction of the optimal revenue if m = O(n). Note that approximately optimal prior-independent mechanisms for symmetric unit-demand bidders are known due to the work by Devanur et al. [21] and Roughgarden et al. [39]. Our result is obtained by combining Theorem 19 and the afore-mentioned prior independent mechanisms.\nTheorem 22. For symmetric bidders with valuations that are subadditive over independent items, let Fj be the distribution of V (tj) where tj \u223c Dj . If Fj is regular for all j \u2208 [m], there is a prior-independent mechanism\nwith revenue at least \u2126 (\nn max{m,n}\n) \u00b7 OPT. Moreover, the mechanism can be implemented efficiently.\nProof. The mechanism in [21] or [39] provides an approximately optimal prior-independent mechanism in the induced unit-demand setting. Let us use M to denote this mechanism. Suppose we restrict every bidder to purchase at most one item in the original setting and then run mechanism M . The expected revenue is the same as M \u2019s expected revenue in the induced setting. Since M \u2019s expected revenue is \u2126(OPTUD) and\nOPTUD = \u2126 (\nn max{m,n}\n) \u00b7OPT, the mechanism we constructed has revenue\u2126 ( n\nmax{m,n}\n) \u00b7OPT.

We obtain our learning results in two settings. The first is the commonly studied setting where sample access to the bidders\u2019 distributions over valuations is given, for both regular distributions and arbitrary distributions with bounded support. Here, our algorithms require polynomially many samples in the number of items and bidders. The second is a more general max-min learning setting that we introduce, where we are given \u201capproximate distributions,\u201d and we seek to compute a mechanism whose revenue is approximately optimal simultaneously for all \u201ctrue distributions\u201d that are close to the ones we were given. These results are more general in that they imply the sample-based results, and are also applicable in settings where we have no sample access to the underlying distributions but have estimated them indirectly via market research or by observation of bidder behavior in previously run, potentially non-truthful auctions. All our results hold for valuation distributions satisfying the standard (and necessary) independenceacross-items property. They also generalize and improve upon recent works of Goldner and Karlin [28] and Morgenstern and Roughgarden [35], which have provided algorithms that learn approximately optimal multi-item mechanisms in more restricted settings with additive, subadditive and unit-demand valuations using sample access to distributions. We generalize these results to the complete unit-demand, additive, and XOS setting, to i.i.d. subadditive bidders, and to the max-min setting. Our results are enabled by new uniform convergence bounds for hypotheses classes under product measures. Our bounds result in exponential savings in sample complexity compared to bounds derived by bounding the VC dimension, and are of independent interest.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
