The key idea is that good features should maximise such dependence. Feature selection for various supervised learning problems (including classification and regression) is unified under this framework, and the solutions can be approximated using a backward-elimination algorithm. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on both artificial and real world datasets.\n\n\n\n\nThe idea that this framework can achieve the desired goal is clear. There is an empirical evidence supporting this view. The empirical evidence supports the notion that such a framework can achieve the desired goal in real life. However, this argument is problematic for the treatment of functional and non-functional features such as semantic constraints. In this paper we show that the implementation of our model can be generalized to more general functions such as the expression of the functions in a given task.\n\nThe best evidence of this paper is through the introduction of a framework that has been developed by many economists. The first-generation models are of high standard performance that allow for much faster performance. In addition, the most recent version of the model also supports the need to simplify the application of generic features.\nThe first-generation model uses a series of features which are available from the previous versions. We propose a third-generation model which aims to provide a common way for machine learning to learn from the problems in the model.\nThe first-generation model was developed using a model in the framework of machine learning which was developed in the late 1990s. The second-generation model uses a single-dimensional linear linear model, which can learn more about machine learning. We present three new classes of learning which are available from the previous version of the model. The first-generation model uses a single-dimensional linear model, which can learn more about machine learning. We discuss the current research methods and its implications on a variety of problems such as the Bayesian classifier, which makes it more feasible to reduce the number of data types. This classifier provides a simple model which can be used for statistical analysis and evaluation of a set of classification and regression parameters.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Apr 2007 08:26:29 GMT  (373kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2668v1", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["le song", "alexander j smola", "arthur gretton", "karsten m borgwardt", "justin bedo"], "accepted": true, "id": "0704.2668"}, "pdf": {"name": "0704.2668.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Supervised Feature Selection via Dependence Estimation", "authors": ["Le Song", "Alex Smola", "Arthur Gretton", "Justin Bedo"], "emails": ["lesong@it.usyd.edu.au", "alex.smola@gmail.com", "arthur.gretton@tuebingen.mpg.de", "borgwardt@dbs.ifi.lmu.de", "bedo@ieee.org"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In supervised learning problems, we are typically given m data points x \u2208 X and their labels y \u2208 Y. The task is to find a functional dependence between x and y, f : x 7\u2212\u2192 y, subject to certain optimality conditions. Representative tasks include binary classification, multi-class classification, regression and ranking. We often want to reduce the dimension of the data (the number of features) before the actual learning (Guyon & Elisseeff, 2003); a larger number of features can be associated with higher data collection cost, more difficulty in model interpretation, higher computational cost for the classifier, and decreased generalisation\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 24 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Corvallis, OR, 2007.

It is therefore important to select an informative feature subset.\nThe problem of supervised feature selection can be cast as a combinatorial optimisation problem. We have a full set of features, denoted S (whose elements correspond to the dimensions of the data). We use these features to predict a particular outcome, for instance the presence of cancer: clearly, only a subset T of features will be relevant. Suppose the relevance of T to the outcome is quantified by Q(T ), and is computed by restricting the data to the dimensions in T . Feature selection can then be formulated as\nT 0 = arg max T \u2286S Q(T ) subject to | T | \u2264 t, (1)\nwhere | \u00b7 | computes the cardinality of a set and t upper bounds the number of selected features. Two important aspects of problem (1) are the choice of the criterion Q(T ) and the selection algorithm.\nFeature Selection Criterion. The choice of Q(T ) should respect the underlying supervised learning tasks \u2014 estimate dependence function f from training data and guarantee f predicts well on test data. Therefore, good criteria should satisfy two conditions:\nI: Q(T ) is capable of detecting any desired (nonlinear as well as linear) functional dependence between the data and labels. II: Q(T ) is concentrated with respect to the underlying measure. This guarantees with high probability that the detected functional dependence is preserved in the test data.\nar X\niv :0\n70 4.\n26 68\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 0\nWhile many feature selection criteria have been explored, few take these two conditions explicitly into account. Examples include the leave-one-out error bound of SVM (Weston et al., 2000) and the mutual information (Koller & Sahami, 1996). Although the latter has good theoretical justification, it requires density estimation, which is problematic for high dimensional and continuous variables. We sidestep these problems by employing a mutual-information like quantity \u2014 the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) (Gretton et al., 2005). HSIC uses kernels for measuring dependence and does not require density estimation. HSIC also has good uniform convergence guarantees. As we show in section 2, HSIC satisfies conditions I and II, required for Q(T ).\nFeature Selection Algorithm. Finding a global optimum for (1) is in general NP-hard (Weston et al., 2003). Many algorithms transform (1) into a continuous problem by introducing weights on the dimensions (Weston et al., 2000, 2003). These methods perform well for linearly separable problems. For nonlinear problems, however, the optimisation usually becomes non-convex and a local optimum does not necessarily provide good features. Greedy approaches \u2013 forward selection and backward elimination \u2013 are often used to tackle problem (1) directly. Forward selection tries to increase Q(T ) as much as possible for each inclusion of features, and backward elimination tries to achieve this for each deletion of features (Guyon et al., 2002). Although forward selection is computationally more efficient, backward elimination provides better features in general since the features are assessed within the context of all others.\nBAHSIC. In principle, HSIC can be employed using either the forwards or backwards strategy, or a mix of strategies. However, in this paper, we will focus on a backward elimination algorithm. Our experiments show that backward elimination outperforms forward selection for HSIC. Backward elimination using HSIC (BAHSIC) is a filter method for feature selection. It selects features independent of a particular classifier. Such decoupling not only facilitates subsequent feature interpretation but also speeds up the computation over wrapper and embedded methods.\nFurthermore, BAHSIC is directly applicable to binary, multiclass, and regression problems. Most other feature selection methods are only formulated either for binary classification or regression. The multi-class extension of these methods is usually accomplished using a one-versus-the-rest strategy. Still fewer methods handle classification and regression cases at the same time. BAHSIC, on the other hand, accommodates all\nthese cases in a principled way: by choosing different kernels, BAHSIC also subsumes many existing methods as special cases. The versatility of BAHSIC originates from the generality of HSIC. Therefore, we begin our exposition with an introduction of HSIC."}, {"heading": "2 Measures of Dependence", "text": "We define X and Y broadly as two domains from which we draw samples (x, y): these may be real valued, vector valued, class labels, strings, graphs, and so on. We define a (possibly nonlinear) mapping \u03c6(x) \u2208 F from each x \u2208 X to a feature space F , such that the inner product between the features is given by a kernel function k(x, x\u2032) := \u3008\u03c6(x), \u03c6(x\u2032)\u3009: F is called a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Likewise, let G be a second RKHS on Y with kernel l(\u00b7, \u00b7) and feature map \u03c8(y). We may now define a cross-covariance operator between these feature maps, in accordance with Baker (1973); Fukumizu et al. (2004): this is a linear operator Cxy : G 7\u2212\u2192 F such that\nCxy = Exy[(\u03c6(x)\u2212 \u00b5x)\u2297 (\u03c8(y)\u2212 \u00b5y)], (2)\nwhere \u2297 is the tensor product. The square of the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the cross-covariance operator (HSIC), \u2016 Cxy \u20162HS, is then used as our feature selection criterion Q(T ). Gretton et al. (2005) show that HSIC can be expressed in terms of kernels as\nHSIC(F ,G,Pr xy ) = \u2016 Cxy \u20162HS (3)\n= Exx\u2032yy\u2032 [k(x, x\u2032)l(y, y\u2032)] + Exx\u2032 [k(x, x\u2032)] Eyy\u2032 [l(y, y\u2032)] \u2212 2 Exy[Ex\u2032 [k(x, x\u2032)] Ey\u2032 [l(y, y\u2032)]],\nwhere Exx\u2032yy\u2032 is the expectation over both (x, y) \u223c Prxy and an additional pair of variables (x\u2032, y\u2032) \u223c Prxy drawn independently according to the same law. Previous work used HSIC to measure independence between two sets of random variables (Gretton et al., 2005). Here we use it to select a subset T from the first full set of random variables S. We now describe further properties of HSIC which support its use as a feature selection criterion.\nProperty (I) Gretton et al. (2005, Theorem 4) show that whenever F ,G are RKHSs with universal kernels k, l on respective compact domains X and Y in the sense of Steinwart (2002), then HSIC(F ,G,Prxy) = 0 if and only if x and y are independent. In terms of feature selection, a universal kernel such as the Gaussian RBF kernel or the Laplace kernel permits HSIC to detect any dependence between X and Y. HSIC is zero if and only if features and labels are independent.\nIn fact, non-universal kernels can also be used for HSIC, although they may not guarantee that all de-\npendencies are detected. Different kernels incorporate distinctive prior knowledge into the dependence estimation, and they focus HSIC on dependence of a certain type. For instance, a linear kernel requires HSIC to seek only second order dependence. Clearly HSIC is capable of finding and exploiting dependence of a much more general nature by kernels on graphs, strings, or other discrete domains.\nProperty (II) Given a sample Z = {(x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym)} of size m drawn from Prxy, we derive an unbiased estimate of HSIC,\nHSIC(F ,G, Z) (4)\n= 1m(m\u22123) [tr(KL) + 1>K11> L1 (m\u22121)(m\u22122) \u2212 2 m\u22122 1 >K L 1],\nwhere K and L are computed as Kij = (1 \u2212 \u03b4ij)k(xi, xj) and Lij = (1 \u2212 \u03b4ij)l(yi, yj). Note that the diagonal entries of K and L are set to zero. The following theorem, a formal statement that the empirical HSIC is unbiased, is proved in the appendix.\nTheorem 1 (HSIC is Unbiased) Let EZ denote the expectation taken over m independent observations (xi, yi) drawn from Prxy. Then\nHSIC(F ,G,Pr xy ) = EZ [HSIC(F ,G, Z)] . (5)\nThis property is by contrast with the mutual information, which can require sophisticated bias correction strategies (e.g. Nemenman et al., 2002).\nU-Statistics. The estimator in (4) can be alternatively formulated using U-statistics,\nHSIC(F ,G, Z) = (m)\u221214 m\u2211\n(i,j,q,r)\u2208im4\nh(i, j, q, r), (6)\nwhere (m)n = m!(m\u2212n)! is the Pochhammer coefficient and where imr denotes the set of all r-tuples drawn without replacement from {1, . . . ,m}. The kernel h of the U-statistic is defined by\n1 4! (i,j,q,r)\u2211 (s,t,u,v) (Kst Lst + Kst Luv \u22122 Kst Lsu) , (7)\nwhere the sum in (7) represents all ordered quadruples (s, t, u, v) selected without replacement from (i, j, q, r).\nWe now show that HSIC(F ,G, Z) is concentrated. Furthermore, its convergence in probability to HSIC(F ,G,Prxy) occurs with rate 1/ \u221a m which is a slight improvement over the convergence of the biased estimator by Gretton et al. (2005).\nTheorem 2 (HSIC is Concentrated) Assume k, l are bounded almost everywhere by 1, and are nonnegative. Then for m > 1 and all \u03b4 > 0, with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4 for all Prxy\n|HSIC(F ,G, Z)\u2212HSIC(F ,G,Pr xy\n)| \u2264 8 \u221a log(2/\u03b4)/m\nBy virtue of (6) we see immediately that HSIC is a U-statistic of order 4, where each term is bounded in [\u22122, 2]. Applying Hoeffing\u2019s bound as in Gretton et al. (2005) proves the result.\nThese two theorems imply the empirical HSIC closely reflects its population counterpart. This means the same features should consistently be selected to achieve high dependence if the data are repeatedly drawn from the same distribution.\nAsymptotic Normality. It follows from Serfling (1980) that under the assumptions E(h2) < \u221e and that the data and labels are not independent, the empirical HSIC converges in distribution to a Gaussian random variable with mean HSIC(F ,G,Prxy) and variance\n\u03c32HSIC = 16 m\n( R\u2212HSIC2 ) , where (8)\nR = 1m m\u2211 i=1 ( (m\u2212 1)\u221213 \u2211 (j,q,r)\u2208im3 \\{i} h(i, j, q, r) )2 ,\nand imr \\{i} denotes the set of all r-tuples drawn without replacement from {1, . . . ,m} \\ {i}. The asymptotic normality allows us to formulate statistics for a significance test. This is useful because it may provide an assessment of the dependence between the selected features and the labels.\nSimple Computation. Note that HSIC(F ,G, Z) is simple to compute, since only the kernel matrices K and L are needed, and no density estimation is involved. For feature selection, L is fixed through the whole process. It can be precomputed and stored for speedup if needed. Note also that HSIC(F ,G, Z) does not need any explicit regularisation parameter. This is encapsulated in the choice of the kernels."}, {"heading": "3 Feature Selection via HSIC", "text": "Having defined our feature selection criterion, we now describe an algorithm that conducts feature selection on the basis of this dependence measure. Using HSIC, we can perform both backward (BAHSIC) and forward (FOHSIC) selection of the features. In particular, when we use a linear kernel on the data (there is no such requirement for the labels), forward selection\nand backward selection are equivalent: the objective function decomposes into individual coordinates, and thus feature selection can be done without recursion in one go. Although forward selection is computationally more efficient, backward elimination in general yields better features, since the quality of the features is assessed within the context of all other features. Hence we present the backward elimination version of our algorithm here (a forward greedy selection version can be derived similarly).\nBAHSIC appends the features from S to the end of a list S\u2020 so that the elements towards the end of S\u2020 have higher relevance to the learning task. The feature selection problem in (1) can be solved by simply taking the last t elements from S\u2020. Our algorithm produces S\u2020 recursively, eliminating the least relevant features from S and adding them to the end of S\u2020 at each iteration. For convenience, we also denote HSIC as HSIC(\u03c3,S), where S are the features used in computing the data kernel matrix K, and \u03c3 is the parameter for the data kernel (for instance, this might be the size of a Gaussian kernel k(x, x\u2032) = exp(\u2212\u03c3 \u2016x\u2212 x\u2032\u20162) ).\nAlgorithm 1 BAHSIC Input: The full set of features S Output: An ordered set of features S\u2020\n1: S\u2020 \u2190 \u2205 2: repeat 3: \u03c3 \u2190 \u039e 4: I \u2190 arg maxI \u2211 j\u2208I HSIC(\u03c3,S \\{j}), I \u2282 S 5: S \u2190 S \\I 6: S\u2020 \u2190 S\u2020 \u222aI 7: until S = \u2205\nStep 3 of the algorithm denotes a policy for adapting the kernel parameters, e.g. by optimising over the possible parameter choices. In our experiments, we typically normalize each feature separately to zero mean and unit variance, and adapt the parameter for a Gaussian kernel by setting \u03c3 to 1/(2d), where d = | S | \u2212 1. If we have prior knowledge about the type of nonlinearity, we can use a kernel with fixed parameters for BAHSIC. In this case, step 3 can be omitted.\nStep 4 of the algorithm is concerned with the selection of a set I of features to eliminate. While one could choose a single element of S, this would be inefficient when there are a large number of irrelevant features. On the other hand, removing too many features at once risks the loss of relevant features. In our experiments, we found a good compromise between speed and feature quality was to remove 10% of the current\nfeatures at each iteration."}, {"heading": "4 Connections to Other Approaches", "text": "We now explore connections to other feature selectors. For binary classification, an alternative criterion for selecting features is to check whether the distributions Pr(x|y = 1) and Pr(x|y = \u22121) differ. For this purpose one could use Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) (Borgwardt et al., 2006). Likewise, one could use Kernel Target Alignment (KTA) (Cristianini et al., 2003) to test directly whether there exists any correlation between data and labels. KTA has been used for feature selection. Formally it is defined as tr K L /\u2016K \u2016\u2016L \u2016. For computational convenience the normalisation is often omitted in practise (Neumann et al., 2005), which leaves us with tr K L. We discuss this unnormalised variant below.\nLet us consider the output kernel l(y, y\u2032) = \u03c1(y)\u03c1(y\u2032), where \u03c1(1) = m\u22121+ and \u03c1(\u22121) = \u2212m\u22121\u2212 , and m+ and m\u2212 are the numbers of positive and negative samples, respectively. With this kernel choice, we show that MMD and KTA are closely related to HSIC. The following theorem is proved in the appendix.\nTheorem 3 (Connection to MMD and KTA) Assume the kernel k(x, x\u2032) for the data is bounded and the kernel for the labels is l(y, y\u2032) = \u03c1(y)\u03c1(y\u2032). Then\u2223\u2223HSIC\u2212 (m\u2212 1)\u22122MMD\u2223\u2223 = O(m\u22121)\u2223\u2223HSIC\u2212 (m\u2212 1)\u22122KTA\u2223\u2223 = O(m\u22121). This means selecting features that maximise HSIC also maximises MMD and KTA. Note that in general (multiclass, regression, or generic binary classification) this connection does not hold."}, {"heading": "5 Variants of BAHSIC", "text": "New variants can be readily derived from BAHSIC by combining the two building blocks of BAHSIC: a kernel on the data and another one on the labels. Here we provide three examples using a Gaussian kernel on the data, while varying the kernel on the labels. This provides us with feature selectors for three problems:\nBinary classification (BIN) We set m\u22121+ as the label for positive class members, and m\u22121\u2212 for negative class members. We then apply a linear kernel.\nMulticlass classification (MUL) We apply a linear kernel on the labels using the label vectors below, as described for a 3-class example. Here mi is the number\nof samples in class i and 1mi denotes a vector of all ones with length mi.\nY =  1m1 m1\n1m1 m2\u2212m 1m1 m3\u2212m\n1m2 m1\u2212m\n1m2 m2\n1m2 m3\u2212m\n1m3 m1\u2212m 1m3 m2\u2212m\n1m3 m3  m\u00d73 . (9)\nRegression (REG) A Gaussian RBF kernel is also used on the labels. For convenience the kernel width \u03c3 is fixed as the median distance between points in the sample (Scho\u0308lkopf & Smola, 2002).\nFor the above variants a further speedup of BAHSIC is possible by updating the entries of the kernel matrix incrementally, since we are using an RBF kernel. We use the fact that \u2016x \u2212 x\u2032\u20162 = \u2211 j \u2016xj \u2212 x\u2032j\u20162. Hence \u2016x \u2212 x\u2032\u20162 needs to be computed only once. Subsequent updates are effected by subtracting \u2016xj \u2212 x\u2032j\u20162 (subscript here indices dimension).\nWe will use BIN, MUL and REG as the particular instances of BAHSIC in our experiments. We will refer to them commonly as BAHSIC since the exact meaning will be clear depending on the datasets encountered. Furthermore, we also instantiate FOHSIC using the same kernels as BIN, MUL and REG, and we adopt the same convention when we refer to it in our experiments."}, {"heading": "6 Experimental Results", "text": "We conducted three sets of experiments. The characteristics of the datasets and the aims of the experiments are: (i) artificial datasets illustrating the properties of BAHSIC; (ii) real datasets that compare BAHSIC with other methods; and (iii) a brain computer interface dataset showing that BAHSIC selects meaningful features."}, {"heading": "6.1 Artificial datasets", "text": "We constructed 3 artificial datasets, as illustrated in Figure 1, to illustrate the difference between BAHSIC variants with linear and nonlinear kernels. Each dataset has 22 dimensions \u2014 only the first two dimensions are related to the prediction task and the rest are just Gaussian noise. These datasets are (i) Binary XOR data: samples belonging to the same class have multimodal distributions; (ii) Multiclass data: there are 4 classes but 3 of them are collinear; (iii) Nonlinear regression data: labels are related to the first two dimension of the data by y = x1 exp(\u2212x21\u2212x22)+ , where denotes additive Gaussian noise. We compare BAHSIC to FOHSIC, Pearson\u2019s correlation, mutual information (Zaffalon & Hutter, 2002), and RELIEF (RELIEF works only for binary problems). We aim to show that when nonlinear dependencies exist in the\ndata, BAHSIC with nonlinear kernels is very competent in finding them.\nWe instantiate the artificial datasets over a range of sample sizes (from 40 to 400), and plot the median rank, produced by various methods, for the first two dimensions of the data. All numbers in Figure 1 are averaged over 10 runs. In all cases, BAHSIC shows good performance. More specifically, we observe:\nBinary XOR Both BAHSIC and RELIEF correctly select the first two dimensions of the data even for small sample sizes; while FOHSIC, Pearson\u2019s correlation, and mutual information fail. This is because the latter three evaluate the goodness of each feature independently. Hence they are unable to capture nonlinear interaction between features.\nMulticlass Data BAHSIC, FOHSIC and mutual information select the correct features irrespective of the size of the sample. Pearson\u2019s correlation only works for large sample size. The collinearity of 3 classes provides linear correlation between the data and the labels, but due to the interference of the fourth class such corre-\nlation is picked up by Pearson\u2019s correlation only for a large sample size.\nNonlinear Regression Data The performance of Pearson\u2019s correlation and mutual information is slightly better than random. BAHSIC and FOHSIC quickly converge to the correct answer as the sample size increases.\nIn fact, we observe that as the sample size increases, BAHSIC is able to rank the relevant features (the first two dimensions) almost correctly in the first iteration (results not shown). While this does not prove BAHSIC with nonlinear kernels is always better than that with a linear kernel, it illustrates the competence of BAHSIC in detecting nonlinear features. This is obviously useful in a real-world situations. The second advantage of BAHSIC is that it is readily applicable to both classification and regression problems, by simply choosing a different kernel on the labels."}, {"heading": "6.2 Real world datasets", "text": "Algorithms In this experiment, we show that the performance of BAHSIC can be comparable to other state-of-the-art feature selectors, namely SVM Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) (Guyon et al., 2002), RELIEF (Kira & Rendell, 1992), L0-norm SVM ( L0) (Weston et al., 2003), and R2W2 (Weston et al., 2000). We used the implementation of these algorithms as given in the Spider machine learning toolbox, since those were the only publicly available implementations.1 Furthermore, we also include filter methods, namely FOHSIC, Pearson\u2019s correlation (PC), and mutual information (MI), in our comparisons.\nDatasets We used various real world datasets taken from the UCI repository,2 the Statlib repository,3 the LibSVM website,4 and the NIPS feature selection challenge5 for comparison.

These 5 features were selected per fold using different methods.

The results for binary datasets are summarized in the first part of Table 1. Those for multiclass and regression datasets are reported respectively in the second and the third parts of Table 1.\nTo provide a concise summary of the performance of various methods on binary datasets, we measured how the methods compare with the best performing one in each dataset in Table 1. We recorded the best absolute performance of all feature selectors as the baseline, and computed the distance of each algorithm to the best possible result. In this context it makes sense to penalize catastrophic failures more than small deviations. In other words, we would like to have a method which is at least almost always very close to the best performing one. Taking the `2 distance achieves this effect, by penalizing larger differences more heavily. It is also our goal to choose an algorithm that performs homogeneously well across all datasets. The `2 distance scores are listed for the binary datasets in Table 1. In general, the smaller the `2 distance, the better the method. In this respect, BAHSIC and FOHSIC have the best performance. We did not produce the `2 distance for multiclass and regression datasets, since the limited number of such datasets did not allow us to draw statistically significant conclusions."}, {"heading": "6.3 Brain-computer interface dataset", "text": "In this experiment, we show that BAHSIC selects features that are meaningful in practise: we use BAHSIC to select a frequency band for a brain-computer interface (BCI) data set from the Berlin BCI group (Dornhege et al., 2004).

The 5 selected frequencies and their 4 nearest neighbours were used to reconstruct the temporal signals (with all other Fourier coefficients eliminated). The result was then passed to a normal CSP method (Dornhege et al., 2004) for feature extraction, and then classified using a linear SVM.\nWe compared automatic filtering using BAHSIC to other filtering approaches: normal CSP method with manual filtering (8-40 Hz), the CSSP method (Lemm et al., 2005), and the CSSSP method (Dornhege et al., 2006). All results presented in Table 2 are obtained using 50\u00d7 2-fold cross-validation. Our method is very competitive and obtains the first and second place for 4 of the 5 subjects. While the CSSP and the CSSSP methods are specialised embedded methods (w.r.t. the CSP method) for frequency selection on BCI data, our\nmethod is entirely generic: BAHSIC decouples feature selection from CSP.\nIn Figure 2, we use HSIC to visualise the responsiveness of different frequency bands to motor imagination. The horizontal and the vertical axes in each subfigure represent the lower and upper bounds for a frequency band, respectively. HSIC is computed for each of these bands. Dornhege et al. (2006) report that the \u00b5 rhythm (approx. 12 Hz) of EEG is most responsive to motor imagination, and that the \u03b2 rhythm (approx. 22 Hz) is also responsive. We expect that HSIC will create a strong peak at the \u00b5 rhythm and a weaker peak at the \u03b2 rhythm, and the absence of other responsive frequency components will create block patterns. Both predictions are confirmed in Figure 2. Furthermore, the large area of the red region for subject \u2018al\u2019 indicates good responsiveness of his \u00b5 rhythm. This also corresponds well with the lowest classification er-\nror obtained for him in Table 2."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "This paper proposes a backward elimination procedure for feature selection using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). The idea behind the resulting algorithm, BAHSIC, is to choose the feature subset that maximises the dependence between the data and labels. With this interpretation, BAHSIC provides a unified feature selection framework for any form of supervised learning. The absence of bias and good convergence properties of the empirical HSIC estimate provide a strong theoretical jutification for using HSIC in this context. Although BAHSIC is a filter method, it still demonstrates good performance compared with more specialised methods in both artificial and real world data. It is also very competitive in terms of runtime performance.6\nAcknowledgments NICTA is funded through the Australian Government\u2019s Baking Australia\u2019s Ability initiative, in part through the ARC.This research was supported by the Pascal Network (IST-2002-506778).\nAppendix\nProof [Theorem 1] Recall that Kii = Lii = 0. We prove the claim by constructing unbiased estimators for each term in (3). Note that we have three types of expectations, namely Exy Ex\u2032y\u2032 , a partially decoupled expectation Exy Ex\u2032 Ey\u2032 , and Ex Ey Ex\u2032 Ey\u2032 , which takes all four expectations independently.\nIf we want to replace the expectations by empirical averages, we need to take care to avoid using the same discrete indices more than once for independent random variables. In other words, when taking expectations over r independent random variables, we need rtuples of indices where each index occurs exactly once. The sets imr satisfy this property. Their cardinalities are given by the Pochhammer symbols (m)r. Jointly drawn random variables, on the other hand, share the same index. We have\nExy Ex\u2032y\u2032 [k(x, x\u2032)l(y, y\u2032)] = EZ [ (m)\u221212 \u2211 (i,j)\u2208im2 Kij Lij ]\n= EZ [ (m)\u221212 tr K L ] .\nIn the case of the expectation over three independent terms Exy Ex\u2032 Ey\u2032 we obtain\nEZ [ (m)\u221213 \u2211 (i,j,q)\u2208im3 Kij Liq ] = EZ [ (m)\u221213 1 >K L 1\u2212 tr K L ] .\n6Code is freely available as part of the Elefant package at http://elefant.developer.nicta.com.au.\nFor four independent random variables Ex Ey Ex\u2032 Ey\u2032 , EZ [ (m)\u221214 \u2211 (i,j,q,r)\u2208im4 Kij Lqr ]\n= EZ [ (m)\u221214 ( 1>K 1 1> L 1\u22124 1>K L 1 +2 tr K L )] .\nTo obtain an expression for HSIC we only need to take linear combinations using (3). Collecting terms related to tr K L, 1>K L 1, and 1>K 1 1> L 1 yields\nHSIC(F ,G,Pr xy ) = 1m(m\u22123) EZ [ tr K L +1 >K11> L1 (m\u22121)(m\u22122) \u2212 2 m\u22122 1 >K L 1 ] .\nThis is the expected value of HSIC[F ,G, Z].\nProof [Theorem 3] We first relate a biased estimator of HSIC to the biased estimator of MMD. The former is given by\n1 (m\u22121)2 tr KHLH where H = I\u2212m \u22121 1 1>\nand the bias is bounded by O(m\u22121), as shown by Gretton et al. (2005). An estimator of MMD with bias O(m\u22121) is\nMMD[F , Z] = 1 m2+ m+\u2211 i,j k(xi,xj) + 1 m2\u2212 m\u2212\u2211 i,j k(xi,xj)\n\u2212 2 m+m\u2212 m+\u2211 i m\u2212\u2211 j k(xi,xj) = tr K L .\nIf we choose l(y, y\u2032) = \u03c1(y)\u03c1(y\u2032) with \u03c1(1) = m\u22121+ and \u03c1(\u22121) = m\u22121\u2212 , we can see L 1 = 0. In this case tr K H L H = tr K L, which shows that the biased estimators of MMD and HSIC are identical up to a constant factor. Since the bias of tr K H L H is O(m\u22121), this implies the same bias for the MMD estimate.\nTo see the same result for Kernel Target Alignment, note that for equal class size the normalisations with regard to m+ and m\u2212 become irrelevant, which yields the corresponding MMD term."}], "references": [{"title": "Joint measures and cross-covariance operators", "author": ["C.
