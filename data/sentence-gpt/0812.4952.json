Introduction", "text": "Active learning is typically defined by contrast to the passive model of supervised learning. In passive learning, all the labels for an unlabeled dataset are obtained at once, while in active learning the learner interactively chooses which data points to label. The great hope of active learning is that interaction can substantially reduce the number of labels required, making learning more practical. This hope is known to be valid in certain special cases, where the number of labels needed to learn actively has been shown to be logarithmic in the usual sample complexity of passive learning; such cases include thresholds on a line, and linear separators with a spherically uniform unlabeled data distribution (Dasgupta et al., 2005).\nMany earlier active learning algorithms, such as (Cohn et al., 1994; Dasgupta et al., 2005), have problems with data that are not perfectly separable under the given hypothesis class. In such cases, they can exhibit a lack of statistical consistency: even with an infinite labeling budget, they might not converge to an optimal predictor (see Dasgupta and Hsu (2008) for a discussion).\nThis problem has recently been addressed in two threads of research. One approach (Balcan et al., 2006; Dasgupta et al., 2008; Hanneke, 2007) constructs learning algorithms that explicitly use sample complexity bounds to assess which hypotheses are still \u201cin the running\u201d (given the labels seen so far), thereby assessing the relative value of different unlabeled\npoints (in terms of whether they help distinguish between the remaining hypotheses). These algorithms have the usual PAC-style convergence guarantees, but they also have rigorous label complexity bounds that are in many cases significantly better than the bounds for passive supervised learning. However, these algorithms have yet to see practical use. First, they are built explicitly for 0\u20131 loss and are not easily adapted to most other loss functions. This is problematic because in many applications, other loss functions are more appropriate for describing the problem, or make learning more tractable (as with convex proxy losses on linear representations). Second, these algorithms make internal use of generalization bounds that are often loose in practice, and they can thus end up requiring far more labels than are really necessary. Finally, they typically require an explicit enumeration over the hypothesis class (or an \u01eb-cover thereof), which is generally computationally intractable.\nThe second approach to active learning uses importance weights to correct sampling bias (Bach, 2007; Sugiyama, 2006). This approach has only been analyzed in limited settings. For example, (Bach, 2007) considers linear models and provides an analysis of consistency in cases where either (i) the model class fits the data perfectly, or (ii) the sampling strategy is non-adaptive (that is, the data point queried at time t doesn\u2019t depend on the sequence of previous queries). The analysis in these works is also asymptotic rather than yielding finite label bounds, while minimizing the actual label complexity is of paramount importance in active learning. Furthermore, the analysis does not prescribe how to choose importance weights, and a poor choice can result in high label complexity.\nImportance-weighted active learning\nWe address the problems above with an active learning scheme that provably yields PACstyle label complexity guarantees. When presented with an unlabeled point xt, this scheme queries its label with a carefully chosen probability pt, taking into account the identity of the point and the history of labels seen so far. The points that end up getting labeled are then weighted according to the reciprocals of these probabilities (that is, 1/pt), in order to remove sampling bias. We show (theorem 1) that this simple method guarantees statistical consistency: for any distribution and any hypothesis class, active learning eventually converges to the optimal hypothesis in the class.\nAs in any importance sampling scenario, the biggest challenge is controlling the variance of the process. This depends crucially on how the sampling probability pt is chosen. Our strategy, roughly, is to make it proportional to the spread of values h(xt), as h ranges over the remaining candidate hypotheses (those with good performance on the labeled points so far). For this setting of pt, which we call IWAL(loss-weighting), we have two results. First, we show (theorem 2) a fallback guarantee that the label complexity is never much worse than that of supervised learning. Second, we rigorously analyze the label complexity in terms of underlying parameters of the learning problem (theorem 7). Previously, label complexity bounds for active learning were only known for 0\u20131 loss, and were based on the disagreement coefficient of the learning problem (Hanneke, 2007). We generalize this notion to general loss functions, and analyze label complexity in terms of it. We consider settings in which these bounds turn out to be roughly the square root of the sample complexity of supervised learning.\nIn addition to these upper bounds, we show a general lower bound on the label complexity of active learning (theorem 9) that significantly improves the best previous such result (Ka\u0308a\u0308ria\u0308inen, 2006).\nWe conduct practical experiments with two IWAL algorithms. The first is a specialization of IWAL(loss-weighting) to the case of linear classifiers with convex loss functions; here, the algorithm becomes tractable via convex programming (section 7). The second, IWAL(bootstrap), uses a simple bootstrapping scheme that reduces active learning to (batch) passive learning without requiring much additional computation (section 7.2). In every case, these experiments yield substantial reductions in label complexity compared to passive learning, without compromising predictive performance. They suggest that IWAL is a practical scheme that can reduce the label complexity of active learning without sacrificing the statistical guarantees (like consistency) we take for granted in passive learning.\nOther related work\nThe active learning algorithms of Abe and Mamitsuka (1998), based on boosting and bagging, are similar in spirit to our IWAL(bootstrap) algorithm in section 7.2. But these earlier algorithms are not consistent in the presence of adversarial noise: they may never converge to the correct solution, even given an infinite label budget. In contrast, IWAL(bootstrap) is consistent and satisfies further guarantees (section 2).\nThe field of experimental design (Pukelsheim, 2006) emphasizes regression problems in which the conditional distribution of the response variable given the predictor variables is assumed to lie in a certain class; the goal is to synthesize query points such that the resulting least-squares estimator has low variance. In contrast, we are interested in an agnostic setting, where no assumptions about the model class being powerful enough to represent the ideal solution exist. Moreover, we are not allowed to synthesize queries, but merely to choose them from a stream (or pool) of candidate queries provided to us. A telling difference between the two models is that in experimental design, it is common to query the same point repeatedly, whereas in our setting this would make no sense."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "Let X be the input space and Y the output space. We consider active learning in the streaming setting where at each step t, a learner observes an unlabeled point xt \u2208 X and has to decide whether to ask for the label yt \u2208 Y . The learner works with a hypothesis space H = {h : X \u2192 Z}, where Z is a prediction space.\nThe algorithm is evaluated with respect to a given loss function l : Z \u00d7 Y \u2192 [0,\u221e). The most common loss function is 0\u20131 loss, in which Y = Z = {\u22121, 1} and l(z, y) = 1(y 6= z) = 1(yz < 0). The following examples address the binary case Y = {\u22121, 1} with Z \u2282 R:\n\u2022 l(z, y) = (1\u2212 yz)+ (hinge loss),\n\u2022 l(z, y) = ln(1 + e\u2212yz) (logistic loss),\n\u2022 l(z, y) = (y \u2212 z)2 = (1\u2212 yz)2 (squared loss), and\n\u2022 l(z, y) = |y \u2212 z| = |1\u2212 yz| (absolute loss).\nNotice that all the loss functions mentioned here are of the form l(z, y) = \u03c6(yz) for some function \u03c6 on the reals. We specifically highlight this subclass of loss functions when proving label complexity bounds. Since these functions are bounded (if Z is), we further assume they are normalized to output a value in [0, 1]."}, {"heading": "3. The Importance Weighting Skeleton", "text": "Algorithm 1 describes the basic outline of importance-weighted active learning (IWAL). Upon seeing xt, the learner calls a subroutine rejection-threshold (instantiated in later sections), which looks at xt and past history to return the probability pt of requesting yt.\nThe algorithm maintains a set of labeled examples seen so far, each with an importance weight: if yt ends up being queried, its weight is set to 1/pt.\nAlgorithm 1 IWAL (subroutine rejection-threshold) Set S0 = \u2205.

Some early active learning algorithms (Cohn et al., 1994; Dasgupta et al., 2005) do not satisfy this baseline guarantee: they have problems if the data cannot be classified perfectly by the given hypothesis class. We prove that IWAL algorithms are consistent, as long as pt is bounded away from 0. Further, we prove that the label complexity required is within a constant factor of supervised learning in the worst case.\nTheorem 1 For all distributions D, for all finite hypothesis classes H, for any \u03b4 > 0, if there is a constant pmin > 0 such that pt \u2265 pmin for all 1 \u2264 t \u2264 T , then\nP\n\nmax h\u2208H\n|LT (h)\u2212 L(h)| > \u221a 2\npmin\n\u221a\nln |H|+ ln 2\u03b4 T\n\n < \u03b4.\nComparing this result to the usual sample complexity bounds in supervised learning (for example, corollary 4.2 of (Langford, 2005)), we see that the label complexity is at most 2/p2min times that of a supervised algorithm. For simplicity, the bound is given in terms of ln |H| rather than the VC dimension of H. The argument, which is a martingale modification of standard results, can be extended to VC spaces.\nProof Fix the underlying distribution.

Can we bound the size of this range, given that any h \u2208 Ht has loss at most L\u2217 + 2\u2206t\u22121?\n2\u2206t\u22121 \u2265 L(h)\u2212 L\u2217 \u2265 Ex,y|l(h(x), y) \u2212 l(h\u2217(x), y)| \u2212 2L\u2217 \u2265 Ex,yC0|y(h(x)\u2212 h\u2217(x))| \u2212 2L\u2217 = C0Ex|h(x)\u2212 h\u2217(x)| \u2212 2L\u2217.\nSo we can upperboundmaxh\u2208Ht Ex|h(x)\u2212h\u2217(x)| (in terms of L\u2217 and \u2206t\u22121), whereas we want to upperbound the expected value of pt, which is proportional to Exmaxh\u2208Ht |h(x)\u2212h\u2217(x)|. The ratio between these two quantities is related to a fundamental parameter of the learning problem, a generalization of the disagreement coefficient (Hanneke, 2007).\nWe flesh out this intuition in the remainder of this section. First we describe a broader class of loss functions than those considered above (including 0\u20131 loss, which is not differentiable); a distance metric on hypotheses, and a generalized disagreement coefficient. We then prove that for this broader class, active learning performs better than passive learning when the generalized disagreement coefficient is small."}, {"heading": "5.2 A subclass of loss functions", "text": "We give label complexity upper bounds for a class of loss functions that includes 0\u20131 loss and logistic loss but not hinge loss.

We now strengthen this lower bound to d\u03b72/\u01eb2, where d is the VC dimension of H.\nLet\u2019s see how this relates to the label complexity rates of the previous section. It is wellknown that if a supervised learner sees T examples (for any T > d/\u03b7), its final hypothesis has error \u2264 \u03b7+ \u221a\nd\u03b7/T (Devroye et al., 1996) with high probability. Think of this as \u03b7+ \u01eb for \u01eb = \u221a\nd\u03b7/T . Our lower bound now implies that an active learner must make at least d\u03b72/\u01eb2 = \u03b7T queries.

Here is a distribution over X\u00d7Y : point xo has probability 1\u2212\u03b2, while each of the remaining xi has probability \u03b2/(d\u22121), where \u03b2 = 2(\u03b7+2\u01eb). At xo, the response is always y = 1. At xi, i \u2265 1, the response is y = 1 with probability 1/2 + \u03b3bi, where bi is either +1 or \u22121, and \u03b3 = 2\u01eb/\u03b2 = \u01eb/(\u03b7 + 2\u01eb) < 1/4.\nNature starts by picking b1, . . . , bd\u22121 uniformly at random. This defines the target hypothesis h\u2217: h\u2217(xo) = 1 and h\n\u2217(xi) = bi. Its error rate is \u03b2 \u00b7 (1/2 \u2212 \u03b3) = \u03b7. Any learner outputs a hypothesis in H and thus implicitly makes guesses at the underlying hidden bits bi. Unless it correctly determines bi for at least 3/4 of the points x1, . . . , xd\u22121, the error of its hypothesis will be at least \u03b7 + (1/4) \u00b7 \u03b2 \u00b7 (2\u03b3) = \u03b7 + \u01eb.\nNow, suppose the active learner makes \u2264 c(d\u22121)/\u03b32 queries, where c is a small constant (c \u2264 1/125 suffices). We\u2019ll show that it fails (outputs a hypothesis with error \u2265 \u03b7+ \u01eb) with probability at least 1/2.\nWe\u2019ll say xi is heavily queried if the active learner queries it at least 4c/\u03b3 2 times. At most 1/4 of the xi\u2019s are heavily queried; without loss of generality, these are x1, . . . , xk, for some k \u2264 (d \u2212 1)/4.

Since k \u2264 (d\u2212 1)/4, the probability that the learner fails is given by\nP[learner fails] = P[F1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ Fd\u22121 \u2265 (d\u2212 1)/4] \u2265 P[Fk+1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ Fd\u22121 \u2265 (d\u2212 1)/4] \u2265 P[B \u2265 (d\u2212 1)/4] \u2265 P[Z \u2265 0] = 1/2,\nwhere B is a binomial((3/4)(d \u2212 1), 1/3) random variable, Z is a standard normal, and the last inequality follows from Slud\u2019s lemma.

Since IWAL explicitly accounts for sample selection bias, we can be sure that these experiments are valid for use in constructing new datasets.
