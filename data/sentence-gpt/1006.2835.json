Panini was the first to define Grammar for Sanskrit language with about 4000 rules in fifth century. These rules contain uncertainty information, and the language is not easily understood. They were used by the Indian people to teach Sanskrit and English.\n\n\nThe grammar is similar in English to the English. In this case it is very clear why not use the word Grammar in some languages. The meaning is that the Sanskrit words used for the Grammar are Sanskrit words and also have the same meanings as English words in some other languages.\nThe main problem of Grammar is that this is not possible in the languages of the people who live in countries where the grammar is present in the language. The fact that many people are aware of the difference between the two languages means it is very hard to understand which language is used in most languages and which language is used in some other languages.\nThe language is not used in many other languages like English or Arabic or English. In fact there is no common sense to the language being used in many other languages. The truth is that it is used in many other languages like English, Arabic, and English.\nThis is a major problem in most languages. Most languages are written in two different languages. A few common languages use the first letters, first of each letter, followed by the second letters. The first letter, first of each letter, followed by the second letter, followed by the second letter, followed by the second letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by the third letter, followed by", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Jun 2010 20:07:32 GMT  (295kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2835v1", "Submitted to Journal of Computer Science and Engineering, seethis http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to Journal of Computer Science and Engineering, seethis http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["p venkata subba reddy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.2835"}, "pdf": {"name": "1006.2835.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Fuzzy Modeling and Natural Language Processing for Panini\u2019s Sanskrit Grammar", "authors": ["P.

There are many logics available to deal with uncertainty like fuzzy logic, probabilistic logic etc.\nFuzzy logic and reasoning [7, 8, 13, 14] are discussed to deal with uncertainty in the rules of Panini\u2019s Sanskrit grammar. The Paninian approach to Natural Language Processing (NLP) is reviewed and compared with the current computer-based understanding systems [6, 12, 15].

Here we discuss Fuzzy logic briefly and later we apply it for Panini\u2019s Sanskrit Grammar [2,3].\nZadeh[9] has introduced Fuzzy set as a model to deal with imprecise, inconsistent and inexact information. Fuzzy set is a class of objects with a continuum of grade of membership.\nThe Fuzzy set A of X is characterized by its\nmembership function A = \u00b5A(x ) and ranging values in the unit interval [0, 1]\n\u00b5A(x ): X [0, 1], x \u0404 X, where X is Universe of discourse. or A = \u00b5A(x 1)/x1 + \u00b5A(x 2)/x2 + \u2026 + \u00b5A(x n)/xn\nWhere \u201c+\u201d is union For instance, x is Tall is defined as Tall = \u00b5Tall(x) [0, 1], where \u201cTall\u201d is fuzzy set. Tall = 0.56/x1 + 0.6/x2 + 0.65/x3 + 0.67/x4 + 0.69/x5 The combination of Fuzzy sets are given as follows A\u039bB = min {\u00b5A(x), \u00b5B(x)}/x (disjunction) AVB = max {\u00b5A(x), \u00b5B(x)}/x (conjunction) A\u2019 = 1 - \u00b5A(x)/x (negation) A  B= max {1 - \u00b5A(x), \u00b5B(x)}/x (implication) \u00b5A(x, y)= {\u00b5A(x) X \u00b5B(y)}/x,y = min{\u00b5A(x) X \u00b5B(y)}/x,y A o R = max {\u00b5A(x), \u00b5A(x, y)}/x where R(x, y) is Fuzzy relation and \u201co\u201d is composition The propositions may contain quantifiers. Square operator is used for \u2018very\u2019, \u2018most\u2019 (concentration). The square root operator is used for \u2018more or less\u2019 (diffusion). For instance, \u00b5very young(x) = \u00b5young(x)2 \u00b5notvery young(x) = 1-\u00b5young(x)2 \u00b5more or less young(x) = \u00b5young(x)1/2\nFuzzy reasoning[8] is a drawing conclusion from Fuzzy propositions using fuzzy inference rules. Some of the Fuzzy inference rules are given bellow R1: x is A R2: x is A x and y are B x or y is B _____________ ____________ y is A\u039bB y is AVB R3: x and y are A R4: x or y are A y and z are B y or z are B ______________ ____________ y and z are B x or z are B\nR5: x is A if x is A then y is B _______________ y is A o (AB)"}, {"heading": "3 FUZZY MODELLING FOR PANINI\u2019S SANSKRIT GRAMMAR", "text": "Grammars are defined to either programming languages or natural languages. Computer processing of natural languages and language translations is an application area in the computer field. Indian languages are having long history. Panini proposed grammar with 4000 rules for Sanskrit. These are categorized into different sets. One of them is Syadvada set. The Syadvada set contains seven possibilities they are given below. 1. May be, it is. (Syadasti) 2. May be, it is not (Sada nasti) 3. May be it is, and it is not at different times (Syad astinasti) 4. May be it is and it is not at the same time and is indescribable (Syad avaktavya) 5. May be it is, and yet indescribable (Syad asti avaktavya) 6. May be it is not, and also indescribable (Syad asti nasti avaktavya) 7. May be it is, and it is not and also indescribable ( Syad\nasti nasti avaktavya) The above rules contain uncertainty. The uncertainty has to be eliminated for further computer processing of the Sanskrit language. Fuzzy logic can be used to eliminate the uncertainty. The fuzzy logic is applied for the above rules to eliminate uncertainty and the rules are given below.\n1. May be, it is. ( Syadasti) \u00b5Syadasti(x) \u2192 [0,1]\n2.

This Sanskrit language representation in English shall be used for reasoning with the Sankrit language\nZenon [16] describes a new programming language FLISP which provides a number of facilities for efficiently representing and manipulating fuzzy knowledge. It is based on fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic theories. The language contains a collection of fuzzy-set operations and procedures for solution of fuzzy relational equations with triangular norms. FLISP forms implement and examine the fuzzy control algorithms. FLISP may be used to deal with Uncertainty in Panini\u2019s Sanskrit Grammer.\nPROLOG can also be used for reasoning with the\nSanskrit language.\n5 COCLUSION\nPanini\u2019s proposed Sanskrit Grammar to Sanskrit language.
