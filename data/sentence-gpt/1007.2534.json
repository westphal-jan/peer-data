In contrast to other works about belief revision, here the constraints are assumed to be fixed. The method has two variants, dual of each other, whose revised degrees of belief are respectively above and below the original ones. The two variants, each with the latter version, have a single set of views, with the latter having different views. For example, I would suggest that the main view is to have a single view at the beginning, and therefore an approach that may be the least restrictive, but might be more consistent. Thus, I suggest that the main view is to have a single view at the end, and therefore a approach that may be the least restrictive, but might be more consistent.\n\nA summary of this paper is provided for reference by the Oxford Companion to History (Oxford University Press, 1997).\nThe main principles of this paper are:\nThe second principle is that one should be able to derive a set of views with respect to a system of logically constrained issues.

Saumell", "text": ""}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "1.1 Around 1990 Lewis A. Kornhauser and Lawrence G. Sager pointed out that collegial courts are liable to what they termed the doctrinal paradox [14, 15 ]. A simple example of it would be the following: A person is on trial for having committed a crime. The case involves two issues p and q whose conjunction, i. e. both of them being true, determines whether the accused is guilty or not. The case is heard by a jury of three members. One of them believes that p is true but not q ; accordingly, he finds the accused not guilty. Another one believes that q is true but not p ; so he also finds the accused not guilty. Finally, the third member of the jury believes that both p and q are true, so he finds the accused guilty. Altogether, one can say that the jury has reached a majority verdict of not guilty. However, one can also say that they have a majority opinion that p is true and that q is also true; accordingly, the accused should be considered guilty. The above-mentioned authors acknowledge that \u201cWe have no clear understanding of how a court should proceed in cases where the doctrinal paradox arises\u201d [15 ].\nThe main issue in a trial is whether the accused is guilty or not. Let t denote the proposition that he is guilty. We are assuming that this proposition is logically connected to p and q as specified by the following doctrine: t \u2194 p \u2227 q . Every member of the jury is required to be consistent with it. Therefore, there are only four consistent opinions about the truth of (p, q, t), namely: (1, 1, 1), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0) and (0, 0, 0), where 1 means true, and 0 means false. Let us consider all possibilities for a jury that is hearing such a case: let x, y, z, u be the fractions who adhere to, respectively, each of those four consistent opinions. In terms of these numbers, the fractions of the jury who believe in the truth of t, p, q are respectively vt = x , vp = x+y and vq = x+ z . These numbers can be seen as degrees of collective belief in the truth of the respective propositions. A natural criterion for collectively deciding about t is to consider it true whenever vt > 1 2 , i. e. x > 1 2 . In the following we will refer to it as the conclusion-based criterion . In contrast, the premise-based criterion considers t true if and only if both vp, vq > 1 2 , i. e. both x+y, x+z > 1 2 . Clearly, if t is found true by the conclusion-based criterion, then it will also be found true by the premisebased one. However, the converse does not hold, as it is exemplified in the preceding paragraph, where vp = vq = 2 3 > 1 2 but vt = 1 3 < 1 2 .\n1.2 The core of the problem is that the majority rule does not keep consistency with the doctrine. Even though each individual votes in a consistent way, the outcome of the majority rule need not be consistent! By the majority rule we mean accepting a proposition \u03b1 and rejecting its negation \u03b1 whenever v\u03b1 > 1 2 .\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 1 3\nFrom this point of view, the problem is entirely analogous to the wellknown paradox pointed out in the eighteenth century by the Marquis of Condorcet in connection with preferential voting [19 ]: When several individuals vote on three or more alternatives by ordering them according to their preferences, the majority rule may result in a cyclic (i. e. non transitive) binary relation. In preferential voting one is interested in the propositions pxy : \u2018x is preferable to y \u2019, where x and y vary over all possible pairs of alternatives, and the doctrine is transitivity, namely pxy \u2227 pyz \u2192 pxz for any three alternatives x, y, z , together with asymmetry, namely pxy \u2192 pyx for any two alternatives x, y . As before, the problem is that the majority rule does not keep consistency with the doctrine. The standard example involves three alternatives a, b, c and three rankings, namely a b c , b c a and c a b . If vxy denotes the fraction of times that x is preferred to y , one gets vab = vbc = vca = 2 3 and vba = vcb = vac = 1 3 . Clearly, the condition vxy > 1 2 does not define a transitive relation.\nYet another class of objects whose aggregation and subsequent application of the majority rule may break away from the corresponding doctrine are equivalence relations. Consider, for example, the set {a, b, c} and the equivalence relations associated respectively with the three following partitions: {{a, b}, {c}} , {{a}, {b, c}} and {{a, b, c}} . If vxy denotes the fraction of times that x and y belong to the same class, one gets vab = vbc = 2 3\nand vac = 1 3\n(together with vyx = vxy ). Here too, the aggregation operation does away with transitivity.\nAll these problems are particular cases of a more general one where the objects being aggregated are systems of degrees of belief for several propositions which are logically constrained by a certain doctrine. This general problem can be referred to as that of constrained judgment aggregation. In a celebrated paper published in 1952, Georges Th. Guilbaud already identified this problem as a generalization of Condorcet\u2019s one: \u201cThe general logic of propositions ... teaches us that the problem is universal. Given several propositions or questions, every logical relation between them can be expressed by establishing the list of possible arrangements of signs and the list of impossible arrangements. ... the rule of the majority may very well lead to a forbidden arrangement\u201d [10 ].\n1.3 Condorcet\u2019s paradox is closely related to the celebrated impossibility theorem formulated in 1950\u201363 by Kenneth J. Arrow [1, 9 ]. This theorem is concerned with preferences expressed by means of complete rankings, ties allowed, and with rules for (deterministically) aggregating any given set of individual preferences of this form into a collective one of the same form. Quite naturally, one would be interested in rules that comply with the following con-"}, {"heading": "4 R. Camps, X. Mora, L. Saumell", "text": "ditions: (i) Anonymity: all individuals play the same role; (ii) Respect for unanimity: if every individual strictly prefers x to y , then the collective ranking strictly prefers also x to y ; (iii) Independence of irrelevant alternatives: the collective preference about two alternatives x and y depends only on the individual preferences about x and y . According to Arrow\u2019s theorem, such a rule does not exist, except in the case where there are only two alternatives.\nThe doctrinal paradox has motivated the question of extending Arrow\u2019s theorem to the general problem of constrained judgment aggregation. Analogously to the preceding paragraph, one would be interested in rules that, besides keeping consistency with the doctrine in question, comply also with the following conditions: (i) Anonymity; (ii) Respect for unanimity: if a particular proposition is accepted by every individual, then it is also accepted by the collective judgment; (iii) Issue-by-issue aggregation (or independence): the collective judgment about each issue depends only on the individual judgments about it. In the present context, the possibility or impossibility of a rule satisfying these conditions clearly depends on the structure of the doctrine under consideration. For instance, the majority rule will always do for an empty doctrine, i. e. several propositions without any logical connection between them. Accordingly, the existing impossibility results, for which we refer to [21, 22, 7, 17, 8 ], specify certain conditions to be met by the doctrine.\n1.4 In practice, one is bound to make decisions, even for doctrines that are included in the above-mentioned impossibility results. The purpose of this article is to put forward a general rule for making such decisions in consistency with the doctrine. This rule will not comply with the property of issue-by-issue aggregation. However, it will be anonymous and it will respect unanimity about any particular issue whenever the individual beliefs are consistent with the doctrine.\nThe proposed method generalizes two other ones that are already known in certain particular areas: In fact, when the doctrine corresponds to the notion of an equivalence relation on a certain set of items, then one of the variants of our method yields the so-called single-link method of cluster analysis [13 ]. On the other hand, when the doctrine corresponds to the notion of a total order, then the proposed method corresponds essentially to the one that was introduced in 1997 by Markus Schulze [24 , 25 ; 27 : p. 228\u2013232; 4 , 5 ].\nThe problem considered in this article should be distinguished from a related but different one that is often referred to as \u2018belief revision\u2019. This subject is reviewed for instance in [11 ]. In contrast to the present work, where the doctrine remains fixed, there one allows for the possibility of revising it.\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 2 5\nThe remainder of this article is organized in five more sections: 2: Setting up the problem. 3: Construction and main results. 4: Technical issues and supplementary topics. 5: Application to specific domains. 6: Discussion and interpretation of the results."}, {"heading": "2 Setting up the problem", "text": "In this section we introduce in more detail the objects that we will be dealing with. We will be definitely based upon propositional logic. However, instead of dealing with all-or-none truth assignments, we will deal with degrees of belief in the whole range from 0 to 1. The term \u2018belief\u2019 should be understood here in a very wide sense; depending on the context, it may be more appropriate to use other terms, such as \u2018plausibility\u2019, \u2018certainty\u2019, \u2018evidence\u2019, et cetera. On the other hand, we will also deal with decision values within a set of three alternatives meaning respectively \u2018accepted\u2019, \u2018rejected\u2019 and \u2018undecided\u2019. Allowing for undecidedness is unavoidable as soon as one looks at aggregating different views on the same issues. Besides, the notion of aggregation also calls for allowing the degree of belief of a negation p to be independent from that of p . This leads to viewing p and p as antagonistic to each other but not necessarily mutually exclusive.\n2.1 To begin with, we are interested in a finite set of basic propositions p, q, r, ... together with their respective negations p, q, r, ... . Following the standard terminology of logic, we will refer to p, q, r, ... as atoms , and an atom or its negation will be called a literal . The set of atoms will be denoted as \u03a0+ , and the set of literals will be denoted as \u03a0 . So, \u03a0 = \u222ap\u2208\u03a0+ {p, p} . A truth assignment is a mapping whereby each literal is assigned one of the values \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019, with the restriction that p is false [resp. true] whenever p is true [resp. false].\nWe will also deal with compound propositions. They are represented by formulas that combine atoms by means of the Boolean operators of propositional calculus, such as \u00ac,\u2227,\u2228,\u2192 and \u2194 . We are assuming that \u00acp = p and \u00ac(p) = p for any p \u2208 \u03a0+ . The notions of entailment \u2014or logical implication\u2014 and logical equivalence between formulas will be understood exactly as in classical bivalent propositional logic: One formula entails another if there is no truth assignment that makes the first one true and the second one false according to the rules of propositional calculus. Two formulas are logically equivalent to each other when their truth value is the same for any truth assignment."}, {"heading": "6 R. Camps, X. Mora, L. Saumell", "text": "A doctrine can be seen as a compound proposition \u2014in other words, a formula\u2014 whose truth is assumed to hold. A truth assignment that makes this formula true will be said to be consistent with the doctrine.\nIn dealing with the doctrine, we will make a crucial use of the well-known fact that any formula can be transformed into logically equivalent ones of the form\n\u03a6(D) := \u2227 C\u2208D ( \u2228 p\u2208C p ) , (1)\nwhere D stands for a collection of subsets of \u03a0 . A formula of this form is called a conjunctive normal form , and the expressions within parentheses are called its clauses . Generally speaking, a clause means any formula of the form\n\u03c6(C) := \u2228 p\u2208C p, (2)\nwhere C is a subset of \u03a0 . Obviously, specifying a clause is equivalent to specifying the associated set C \u2282 \u03a0 , and specifying a conjunctive normal form is equivalent to specifying the associated collection D of subsets of \u03a0 . Because of that, in the following we will sometimes refer to the sets C \u2208 D themselves as \u2018clauses\u2019 and we may even refer to the collection D as the \u2018doctrine\u2019.\nA conjunctive normal form being true means that each of its clauses is true. On the other hand, a clause being true means that at least one of its literals is true; in other words, if all of its literals but one are known to be false, then the remaining one must be true. Therefore, the doctrine associated with (1) provides the following implications:\np \u2190 \u2227 \u03b1\u2208C \u03b1 6=p \u03b1, (3)\nfor any C \u2208 D such that p \u2208 C . The method developed below will be based crucially on such implications.\nThe conjunctive normal forms equivalent to a given doctrine are by no means unique. Later on, we will restrict ourselves to the special class of prime conjunctive normal forms , and eventually we will choose a particular member of that class which is known as the Blake canonical form. These concepts will be introduced in \u00a7 4.1.\nOn the other hand, we adopt from now on the following assumptions:\n(D1) The doctrine is satisfiable and it is given in conjunctive normal form.\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 2 7\n(D2) It does not contain unit clauses, i. e. clauses with a single literal. Otherwise, one can always fix it by replacing such literals and their negations by the corresponding truth values, and deleting them from \u03a0 .\n(D3) It explicitly contains each of the tertium non datur clauses p \u2228 p , with p \u2208 \u03a0+ . This special convention provides the trivial implications p\u2190 p for any p \u2208 \u03a0 .\n2.2 We call valuation any mapping w whereby each literal p in \u03a0 is assigned a value wp in the interval of real numbers from 0 to 1. The number wp , sometimes denoted alternatively as w(p), will be seen as a degree of belief in the proposition p .\nGenerally speaking, the values of wp and wp need not add up to 1, but their sum can take any value from 0 to 2. Having wp + wp < 1 means a lack of information, whereas wp+wp > 1 means that some contradiction is present. A valuation that satisfies wp +wp = 1 for any p \u2208 \u03a0 will be called balanced .\nLater on, we will sometimes compare two valuations v and w . In that connection, v \u2264 w will mean simply that vp \u2264 wp for any p \u2208 \u03a0 .\nThe truth assignments of classical propositional logic can be seen as balanced valuations that take only the values 0 and 1, where 1 means \u2018true\u2019 and 0 means \u2018false\u2019. Since they are formally the same, in the sequel we will often identify truth assignments with balanced all-or-none beliefs.\nWe will also be interested in balanced valuations with values in {0, 1 2 , 1} ,\nwhere the value 1 2\ncan be interpreted as \u2018undefined\u2019 or \u2018undecided\u2019. We will refer to such valuations as partial truth assignments , a term that we are taking from satisfiability theory. They will be used mainly for specifying decisions, in which case the values 1, 0 and 1\n2 can be interpreted as meaning\nrespectively \u2018accepted\u2019, \u2018rejected\u2019 and \u2018undecided\u2019.\nA partial truth assignment u will be said to be definitely consistent with D , or with \u03a6(D), when, for each clause C \u2208 D and every p \u2208 C , the following implication holds: if u\u03b1 = 0 for every \u03b1 \u2208 C\\{p} , then up = 1. When no undecidedness is present, a partial truth assignment being definitely consistent is equivalent to its being consistent as a truth assignment. When undecidedness is allowed, definite consistency requires every clause to contain at least one accepted literal, or alternatively, at least two undecided literals."}, {"heading": "8 R. Camps, X. Mora, L. Saumell", "text": "Every valuation w gives rise to a (partial) decision in the following way, that depends on a parameter \u03b7 in the interval 0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 1: For any p \u2208 \u03a0 ,\np is accepted and p is rejected whenever wp \u2212 wp > \u03b7, (4) p and p are left undecided whenever |wp \u2212 wp | \u2264 \u03b7. (5)\nWe will refer to it as the decision of margin \u03b7 associated with w , and we will identify it with the corresponding partial truth assignment, which will be denoted as \u00b5\u03b7(w). In the case \u03b7 = 0 we will call it the basic decision associated with w , and the corresponding partial truth assignment will be denoted as \u00b5(w). In tune with these definitions, the difference wp\u2212wp will be called the acceptability of p according to w . If the valuation w is balanced, then the basic decision criterion is equivalent to the majority rule of \u00a71.2, namely accepting p and rejecting p whenever wp > 12 .\n2.3 Valuations are often an aggregate of several components (members of a jury, decision criteria, etc.), i. e. an average of the form\nvp = \u2211 k ak v k p , (6)\nwhere vk are the component valuations, and ak are the corresponding relative frequencies or weights, satisfying ak \u2265 0 for any k and \u2211 k ak = 1. If the component valuations have an all-or-none character, then vp is the fraction of components where p is considered valid.\nThe doctrinal paradox points out the possibility that the average valuation be not consistent with the doctrine even when all component valuations are consistent with it.\n2.4 Our main aim can be stated in the following way: Given a valuation v , build a revised one that achieves consistency with the doctrine while staying as near as possible to v .\nIn the method presented below, the consistency of the revised valuation will hold in a general sense that entails the definite consistency of the associated decisions in the sense of the definition given in \u00a7 2.2.\nGenerally speaking, we will obtain two revised valuations v\u2217 and \u2217v satisfying the inequalities \u2217v \u2264 v \u2264 v\u2217 . We will call them respectively the upper and lower revised valuations. For a balanced original valuation, the upper and lower revised valuations give rise to exactly the same decision. However, in the unbalanced case they can lead to different decisions.\nFor the moment, we will be concerned only with the upper revised valuation v\u2217 , the lower one being introduced at the end by duality.\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 3 9"}, {"heading": "3 Construction and main results", "text": "3.1 Construction. The upper revised valuation will be obtained by means of an iterative process whereby belief will be propagated along the implications contained in the doctrine. More specifically, we will consider the implications (3) and we will apply the following general principle:\n(P) Consider an implication of the form p \u2190 \u2227 \u03b1\u2208\u03a3 \u03b1 with \u03a3 \u2282 \u03a0 .\nAs soon as the right-hand side is satisfiable, this implication gives to p at least the same degree of belief as the weakest of the conjuncts \u03b1 .\nThe hypothesis of satisfiability contained in this principle should be understood in relation to the doctrine under consideration: Among the truth assignments that make the doctrine true, at least one of them should make the conjunction \u2227 \u03b1\u2208\u03a3 \u03b1 true. Unless otherwise stated, in the sequel \u2018satisfiability\u2019 should always be understood in this sense. In \u00a7 4.1 we will see that this amounts to requiring the conjunctive normal form that expresses the doctrine to be a prime conjunctive normal form. However, for the moment we need not be concerned with this question. In fact, principle (P) will be used only to motivate certain definitions that can be applied to any conjunctive normal form.\nIn contrast, the present subsection already makes use of the assumptions (D1, D2, D3) adopted at the end of \u00a7 2.1.\nLet us look at the consequences of applying principle (P) to the implications (3). Starting with the degrees of belief given by v , we infer that every p \u2208 \u03a0 should be believed at least in the degree v\u2032p defined by\nv\u2032p = max C\u2208D C3p min \u03b1\u2208C \u03b1 6=p v\u03b1, (7)\nwhere the max and min operators are ensured to deal with non-empty sets of values as a consequence of assumptions (D2) and (D3).\nLemma 3.1. The transformation v 7\u2192 v\u2032 has the following properties: (a) It is continuous.\n(b) v \u2264 w implies v\u2032 \u2264 w\u2032 . (c) v \u2264 v\u2032 . (d) The image set of v\u2032 is contained in that of v .\nProof. Part (a): Since max and min are continuous. Part (b): Since max and min are monotone. Part (c): Because of the tertium non datur clauses"}, {"heading": "10 R. Camps, X. Mora, L. Saumell", "text": "provided by (D3), one of the arguments of the max operator in the righthand side of (7) is vp . Part (d): Formula (7) entails that v \u2032 p coincides with v\u03b1 for some \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0 .\nAs soon as we accept v\u2032 as new degrees of belief, it makes sense to repeat the same operation with v replaced by v\u2032 , thus obtaining a still higher valuation v\u2032\u2032 , and so on. By proceeding in this way, one obtains a non-decreasing sequence of valuations v(n) (n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ) with the property that all of them take values in the same finite set, namely { v\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0 } . Obviously, this implies that this sequence will eventually reach an invariant state v\u2217 . This eventual valuation is, by definition, the upper revised valuation .\nTheorem 3.2. The transformation v 7\u2192 v\u2217 has the following properties: (a) It is continuous.\n(b) v \u2264 w implies v\u2217 \u2264 w\u2217 . (c) v \u2264 v\u2217 . (d) The image set of v\u2217 is contained in that of v .\nProof. Everything is an immediate consequence of Lemma 3.1.\nTheorem 3.3. The upper revised valuation v\u2217 is the lowest of the valuations w that lie above v and satisfy the equation w\u2032 = w .\nProof. Theorem 3.2 ensures that v\u2217 satisfies the inequality v \u2264 v\u2217 . Besides, its being invariant by the transformation w 7\u2192 w\u2032 means that it satisfies the equality v\u2217\u2032 = v\u2217 . It remains to see that v \u2264 w together with w\u2032 = w implies v\u2217 \u2264 w . To this effect, it suffices to use Theorem 3.2.b to see that the inequality v \u2264 w entails v\u2217 \u2264 w\u2217 , and to combine this inequality with the equality w\u2217 = w , which follows from w\u2032 = w by the definition of w\u2217 .\n3.2 Consistency. Let us look at the meaning of satisfying the equation w\u2032 = w . Since the inequality w\u2032 \u2265 w is always satisfied \u2014because of the tertium non datur clauses, as it was seen in Lemma 3.1.c\u2014 satisfying that equation is equivalent to satisfying the inequality w \u2265 w\u2032 , i. e. having\nwp \u2265 min \u03b1\u2208C \u03b16=p w\u03b1, \u2200p \u2208 \u03a0 and \u2200C \u2208 D with p \u2208 C . (8)\nThis is saying that the valuation w is consistent with principle (P) in connection with all the implications of the form (3) contained in the doctrine. This\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 3 11\nmotivates the following definition: A valuation w is consistent with the doctrine D if and only if it satisfies the equation w\u2032 = w , where w\u2032 means the image of w by the transformation defined by (7). As we have just remarked, this is equivalent to requiring that w satisfies the inequalities (8).\nThe following results show that this notion of consistency for a general valuation w agrees with the standard notion of consistency of a truth assignment \u2014namely that the Boolean formula (1) evaluates to true\u2014 and it is stronger than the notion of definite consistency of a decision that we defined in \u00a7 2.2.\nProposition 3.4. A truth assignment is consistent with the doctrine if and only if the corresponding all-or-none valuation u satisfies the equality u\u2032 = u.\nProof. Let \u03a6 be the conjunctive normal form that expresses the doctrine.\nLet us begin by seeing that the consistency of the truth assignment implies u\u2032p = up for any p \u2208 \u03a0 . When up = 1, this is true because of parts (c) and (d) of Lemma 3.1. When up = 0, the truth of \u03a6 requires that any clause C that contains p must contain also some \u03b1 6= p with u\u03b1 = 1 and therefore u\u03b1 = 0. By introducing this in (7) one gets u \u2032 p = 0.\nLet us see now that the truth assignment not being consistent implies u\u2032 6= u . The lack of consistency of the truth assignment means that there exists at least one clause C that is not satisfied, i. e. such that up = 0 for any p \u2208 C . By taking one such p and noticing that u\u03b1 = 1 for any \u03b1 \u2208 C \\ {p} \u2014that exists because of (D2)\u2014 one gets u\u2032p = 1 > 0 = up .\nProposition 3.5. Let u be a partial truth assignment. If the equality u\u2032 = u is satisfied, then u is definitely consistent with the doctrine.\nProof. In accordance with the definition of definite consistency given in \u00a7 2.2, we have to check that for each C \u2208 D and every p \u2208 C , having u\u03b1 = 1 for all \u03b1 \u2208 C \\ {p} implies up = 1. To this effect, it suffices to use the definition of u\u2032 , which gives u\u2032p = 1, plus the assumed equality up = u \u2032 p .\nRemark. The converse is not true: In fact, for a clause p\u2228q\u2228r the definition of definite consistency allows for having up = 0 and uq = ur = 1 2 , in which case one gets u\u2032p = 1 2 6= up . Having said that, one easily sees that u being definitely consistent implies \u00b5(u\u2032) = u .\nThe following is one of the fundamental results of this article:"}, {"heading": "12 R. Camps, X. Mora, L. Saumell", "text": "Theorem 3.6. A valuation w being consistent, i. e. satisfying the equality w\u2032 = w , entails the definite consistency of the associated decision of margin \u03b7 \u2014that is the partial truth assignment \u00b5\u03b7(w)\u2014 for any \u03b7 in the interval 0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 1.\nProof. Recall that the consistency of w is equivalent to its satisfying the inequalities (8). In accordance with the definition of definite consistency, we must show that for each C \u2208 D and every p \u2208 C , if all \u03b1 \u2208 C \\ {p} are rejected for the decision of margin \u03b7 associated with w , then p is accepted for this decision. Assume the contrary: p is not accepted, that is\nwp \u2265 wp \u2212 \u03b7. (9)\nFrom (8) it follows that\nwp \u2265 min \u03b1\u2208C \u03b1 6=p w\u03b1 = wq, (10)\nfor some q \u2208 C \\ {p} . Let us fix such a q . By combining (9) and (10) we get\nwp \u2265 wq \u2212 \u03b7. (11)\nNow, since q 6= p , the hypothesis that q is rejected is saying that\nwq \u2212 \u03b7 > wq. (12)\nOn the other hand, (8) entails that\nwq \u2265 min \u03b1\u2208C \u03b1 6=q\nw\u03b1 = min ( wp , min\n\u03b1\u2208C \u03b1 6\u2208{p,q}\nw\u03b1\n) , (13)\nfrom which (11) and (10) \u2014and the hypothesis that \u03b7 \u2265 0\u2014 allow to conclude that\nwq \u2265 wq \u2212 \u03b7, (14)\nin contradiction with (12).\nCorollary 3.7. For any \u03b7 in the interval 0\u2264 \u03b7\u2264 1, the decision of margin \u03b7 associated with the upper revised valuation v\u2217 \u2014that is the partial truth assignment \u00b5\u03b7(v \u2217)\u2014 is always definitely consistent.\nProof. It is simply a matter of recalling that v\u2217 satisfies the hypothesis of the preceding theorem.\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 3 13\n3.3 Respect for consistent majority decisions and respect for unanimity. A very natural property to ask for is the following: If the majority criterion applied to the original valuation v decides on each issue and is consistent with the doctrine, then this decision should hold. This property of respect for consistent majority decisions will be obtained as a consequence of the following fact:\nProposition 3.8. For any valuation v , and any consistent truth assignment u, one has\nmax up=1 v\u2217p \u2264 max uq=1 vq. (15)\nProof. Since v\u2217 is obtained by iterating the transformation v 7\u2192 v\u2032 , it suffices to show that this transformation has the following property analogous to (15): v\u2032p \u2264 maxuq=1 vq whenever up = 1. This follows immediately from (7) because the consistency of u requires every clause C that contains p with up = 1 to contain also some q with uq = 1, which ensures that min\u03b1\u2208C,\u03b16=p v\u03b1 \u2264 maxuq=1 vq .\nThe property of respect for consistent majority decisions corresponds to the case \u03b8 \u2265 1\n2 \u2265 \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b7 of the following more general result:\nTheorem 3.9. Assume that there exist \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1) and \u03b7 \u2208 [0, 1) such that every p \u2208 \u03a0 satisfies either vp > \u03b8 \u2265 \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b7 > vp or, contrarily, vp > \u03b8 \u2265 \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b7 > vp . If the decision associated with v (which contains no undecidedness and has a margin \u03b7) is consistent with the doctrine, then it agrees with the decision of margin \u03b7 associated with the upper revised valuation v\u2217 .\nProof. Let u be the truth assignment that corresponds to the decision associated with v , that is:\nup = { 1, if vp > \u03b8 \u2265 \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b7 > vp; 0, if vp > \u03b8 \u2265 \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b7 > vp.\n(16)\nFrom this definition it follows that\nmin up=1 vp \u2212 max up=1 vp > \u03b7. (17)\nBy combining this inequality with (15), which holds because of the consistency of u , and part (c) of Theorem 3.2, it follows that\nmin up=1 v\u2217p \u2212 max up=1 v\u2217p > \u03b7, (18)\nwhich implies v\u2217p \u2212 v\u2217p > \u03b7 whenever up = 1."}, {"heading": "14 R. Camps, X. Mora, L. Saumell", "text": "Remark. When v is balanced, the condition vp > 1 2 > vp is equivalent to requiring simply that vp > vp . Generally speaking, however, the latter condition cannot be substituted for the former in the preceding result.\nAccording to part (c) of Theorem 3.2, vp = 1 implies v \u2217 p = 1. The following result shows that the converse implication holds when v is an aggregate of definitely consistent partial truth assignments. By an aggregate we mean a convex combination of several components vk , as in (6).\nProposition 3.10. Assume that v is an aggregate of definitely consistent partial truth assignments. In this case, having v\u2217p = 1 implies vp = 1.\nProof. We will proceed by induction on the iterates v(n) . More specifically, we aim at showing that\nfor any p \u2208 \u03a0 , the equality v(n)p = 1 implies vp = 1, (19n)\nwhere we emphasize that the statement includes the quantifier \u201cfor any p\u2208\u03a0 \u201d. For n = 0 this is trivially true since v(0) = v . For n \u2265 1, (19n ) can be obtained from (19n\u22121 ) in the following way: Let us assume that v (n) p = 1. If v (n\u22121) p = 1, the conclusion follows directly from (19n\u22121 ). Otherwise, the inequality 1 = v (n) p > v (n\u22121) p entails the existence of a proper clause C , i. e. a clause different from the ones associated with the tertium non datur principle, such that v\n(n\u22121) \u03b1 = 1 for any \u03b1 \u2208 C \\{p} . Now, (19n\u22121 ) ensures that v\u03b1 = 1.\nNotice that this implies v\u2032p = 1, which entails vp = 1 once (191 ) is established; however, establishing (19n ) for any n \u2265 1 requires making use of the fact that v has the form (6), where the vk are definitely consistent partial truth assignments. Since ak \u2265 0 and \u2211 k ak = 1, it is clear that the equality v\u03b1 = 1 entails v k \u03b1 = 1 whenever ak > 0, i. e. for any k that matters. Now, since partial truth assignments are balanced, it follows that vk\u03b1 = 0. On the other hand, since the vk are definitely consistent with the doctrine, and the preceding conclusion is valid for any \u03b1 \u2208 C \\ {p} , it follows that vkp = 1. Finally, this certainly implies vp = 1.\nAn important consequence of the preceding result is the following property of respect for unanimity:\nTheorem 3.11. Assume that v is an aggregate of definitely consistent partial truth assignments. In this case, having vp = 1 implies that p is accepted by the basic decision associated with the upper revised valuation v\u2217 .\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 3 15\nProof. We must show that v\u2217p > v \u2217 p . In the present case we know that v\u2217p = 1, so that the proof reduces to showing that v \u2217 p < 1. This inequality is easily obtained by contradiction. In fact, according to Proposition 3.10, v\u2217p = 1 would imply vp = 1, that is incompatible with vp = 1 because vp + vp = 1, which derives from the analogous equality satisfied by the components vk .\n3.4 Monotonicity. In this subsection we look at the effect of raising the original value of a particular literal p without any change in the others. We aim at showing that in these circumstances the acceptability of p either increases or stays constant.\nLemma 3.12. Consider the dependence of v\u2217q on vp when v\u03b1 is kept constant for all \u03b1 6= p. For any q \u2208 \u03a0 , this dependence has the following form: there exist a and b with 0 \u2264 a \u2264 b \u2264 1 such that\nv\u2217q =  a, for 0 \u2264 vp \u2264 a, vp, for a \u2264 vp \u2264 b, b, for b \u2264 vp \u2264 1.\n(20)\nProof. According to part (d) Theorem 3.2, the graph of v\u2217q as a function of vp is contained in the union of the horizontal lines v \u2217 q = v\u03b1 (\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0 \\ {p}) together with the diagonal one v\u2217q = vp . On the other hand, part (a) of that theorem ensures that the function vp 7\u2192 v\u2217q is continuous. These constraints leave no other possibility than the pattern (20).\nIn order to analyse the effect of raising the value of vp we will use the following notation and terminology: v\u0303 denotes a modified valuation that differs from v only in that v\u0303p > vp . The objects associated with v\u0303 will be referred to by means of a tilde. For any magnitude u that depends on vp , the statement \u201cu stays constant \u201d means that there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that for any v\u0303p in the interval vp \u2264 v\u0303p \u2264 vp + \u03b4 one has u\u0303 = u ; similarly, the statement \u201cu increases \u201d means that there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that for any v\u0303p in the interval vp < v\u0303p \u2264 vp + \u03b4 one has u\u0303 > u . Notice that these definitions consider only values of v\u0303p at the right of vp .\nLemma 3.13. Let us allow vp to grow while v\u03b1 is kept constant for \u03b1 6= p. If there exists q \u2208 \u03a0 such that v\u2217q increases, then v\u2217p = vp .\nProof. We will proceed by contradiction. Let us assume that v\u2217p 6= vp . According to part (c) of Theorem 3.2, it must be v\u2217p > vp . This allows to"}, {"heading": "16 R. Camps, X. Mora, L. Saumell", "text": "choose v\u0303p so that vp < v\u0303p < v \u2217 p . The hypothesis that v \u2217 q increases ensures that v\u2217q < v\u0303 \u2217 q (this is true not only for v\u0303p in a neighbourhood at the right of vp , but also for any v\u0303p > vp , since part (b) of Theorem 3.2 ensures that v\u0303\u2217q is a non-decreasing function of vp ). Let us consider now the valuation w that coincides with v for all literals except possibly p , for which we set wp = v \u2217 p . Since v\u0303p < v \u2217 p , part (b) of Theorem 3.2 ensures that v\u0303 \u2217 q \u2264 w\u2217q . We will arrive at contradiction by showing that w\u2217q = v \u2217 q . In fact, by combining this equality with some of the preceding inequalities, namely v\u2217q < v\u0303 \u2217 q \u2264 w\u2217q , one would arrive at the false conclusion that v\u2217q < v \u2217 q .\nThe claim that w\u2217q = v \u2217 q is again a consequence of part (b) of Theorem 3.2: Since v \u2264 w \u2264 v\u2217 , that result ensures that v\u2217 \u2264 w\u2217 \u2264 v\u2217\u2217 . On the other hand, the invariance of v\u2217 by the transformation u 7\u2192 u\u2032 entails v\u2217\u2217 = v\u2217 .\nTheorem 3.14. Let us allow vp to grow while v\u03b1 is kept constant for \u03b1 6= p. In these circumstances, the acceptability of p, that is the difference v\u2217p \u2212 v\u2217p , either increases or stays constant.\nProof. By part (b) of Theorem 3.2, v\u2217p and v \u2217 p have the property that each of them either increases or stays constant. When v\u2217p stays constant we are done. Now, when v\u2217p increases, Lemma 3.13 ensures that v \u2217 p = vp . Since v\u0303\u2217p \u2265 v\u0303p > vp , it follows that v\u2217p increases too. However, according to Lemma 3.12 the only possible way for both v\u2217p and v \u2217 p to increase is by having v\u0303\u2217p = v\u0303 \u2217 p = v\u0303p for any v\u0303p in an interval of the form vp \u2264 v\u0303p \u2264 vp + \u03b4 with \u03b4 > 0, which entails that v\u2217p\u2212v\u2217p stays constant (and equal to zero).\nCorollary 3.15. Assume that the valuation v is modified into a new one v\u0303 such that\nv\u0303p > vp, v\u0303q = vq, \u2200q \u2208 \u03a0 \\ {p}, (21)\nand let \u03b7 be any number in the interval 0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 1. If p is accepted [resp. not rejected ] in the decision of margin \u03b7 associated with v\u2217 , then it is also accepted [resp. not rejected ] in the decision of margin \u03b7 associated with v\u0303\u2217 ."}, {"heading": "4 Technical issues and supplementary topics", "text": "4.1 Which conjunctive normal form? In this subsection we look at the effect of the conjunctive normal form \u03a6 that expresses the doctrine. In this connection, we will be led to make a particular choice, namely the so-called Blake canonical form.\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 4 17\nIn the following \u03a6\u0303 stands for an alternative conjunctive normal form (with literals in the same set \u03a0 ) and we systematically use a tilde to denote the objects associated with \u03a6\u0303 . In particular, v\u2217 and v\u0303\u2217 mean the upper revised valuations obtained from a given v by using respectively \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0303 . For the moment, \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0303 need not be logically equivalent to each other.\nIf one has v\u2217 = v\u0303\u2217 for any v we will say that \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0303 are \u2217-equivalent.\nProposition 4.1. \u2217-Equivalence implies logical equivalence.\nProof. \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0303 not being logically equivalent means that there exists a truth assignment u that makes one of them, say \u03a6, true, and the other, \u03a6\u0303 , false. According to Proposition 3.4, this entails that u\u2217 = u but u\u0303\u2217 6= u , so that \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0303 are not \u2217-equivalent.\nHowever, logical equivalence does not imply \u2217-equivalence. As a simple example, we can take \u03a6 = (p \u2228 q) \u2227 (p \u2228 q \u2228 r) and \u03a6\u0303 = p \u2228 q , for which one easily checks that v\u0303\u2217r = vr < v \u2217 r as soon as vr < min(vp, vq). The following result can be seen as a generalization of what happens in this example.\nProposition 4.2. If all clauses of \u03a6\u0303 are present also in \u03a6, i. e. D\u0303 \u2286 D, then v\u0303\u2217 \u2264 v\u2217 .\nProof. We will proceed by induction along the iteration that eventually gives the upper revised valuation v\u2217 . As in \u00a7 3.1, we denote the iterates by v(n) . We aim at showing that v\u0303(n) \u2264 v(n) for any n \u2265 0. For n = 0 this is satisfied as an equality, since we are starting from the same valuation v . In order to go from n\u2212 1 to n , it suffices to compare v\u0303(n) and v(n) through the valuation w defined by\nwp = max C\u2208D C3p min \u03b1\u2208C \u03b1 6=p\nv\u0303 (n\u22121) \u03b1 , (22)\n(with a tilde in v\u0303(n\u22121) , but not in D). In fact, on the one hand, by comparing the preceding expression with the one that defines v\u0303(n) in terms of v\u0303(n\u22121) , one easily sees that v\u0303(n) \u2264 w , since more clauses entail a higher maximum. On the other hand, Lemma 3.1.b allows to derive the inequality w \u2264 v(n) from the hypothesis that v\u0303(n\u22121) \u2264 v(n\u22121) .\nLet us look at the meaning of the hypothesis contained in principle (P), namely the satisfiability (within the doctrine under consideration) of the conjunction \u2227 \u03b1\u2208\u03a3 \u03b1 that implies p . Not requiring this satisfiability would lead"}, {"heading": "18 R. Camps, X. Mora, L.

Now, the conjunction that appears in (3) is \u2227 \u03b1\u2208C,\u03b16=p \u03b1 , whose not being sat-\nisfiable is equivalent to \u2228 \u03b1\u2208C,\u03b16=p \u03b1 being always satisfied, in which case the\nclause \u2228 \u03b1\u2208C \u03b1 could have been replaced by the stronger one \u2228 \u03b1\u2208C,\u03b16=p \u03b1 . So, the hypothesis that the right-hand side of (3) is satisfiable whenever p \u2208 C \u2208 D amounts to say that every clause has the property that the corresponding set C \u2208 D has no proper subset C \u2032 with \u03c6(C \u2032) = \u2228 \u03b1\u2208C\u2032 \u03b1 already entailed by the doctrine. In other words, every clause should be a prime implicate of the doctrine under consideration. In [7, 17, 8 ] one uses the equivalent terminology of saying that C = {\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 C } is a \u2018minimal inconsistent set\u2019, whereas in [21, 22 ] C is said to be a \u2018critical family\u2019. From now on we add the following assumption to those adopted in \u00a7 2.1:\n(D4) The conjunctive normal form that expresses the doctrine is made of prime implicates.\nSuch conjunctive normal forms will be referred to as prime conjunctive normal forms . As we have seen at the beginning of this paragraph, they are the only ones that propagate belief in a proper way, without making it up.\nAmong all the prime conjunctive normal forms equivalent to a given doctrine, we will take as a natural choice the Blake canonical form , so called after Archie Blake, who introduced it in 1937 [2 ]. Given a formula f , the Blake canonical form of f is the conjunctive normal form which is made of all the prime implicates of f . The following statement gives its main property in connection with the upper revised valuation v\u2217 :\nProposition 4.3. Among all the prime conjunctive normal forms logically equivalent to a given doctrine, the Blake canonical form has the property of giving the greatest possible upper revised valuation.\nProof. It follows immediately from the definitions by virtue of Proposition 4.2.\nThe next theorem gives a systematic method for obtaining the Blake canonical form of a formula f . The procedure will start from any conjunctive normal form \u03a6\u0303 logically equivalent to f \u2014which is quite easy to obtain\u2014 and it will apply repeatedly the two following operations, where \u03c6, \u03c8 stand for generic disjunctions of literals:\nAbsorption: replacing \u03c6 \u2227 (\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8) by \u03c6 .\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 4 19\nResolution: replacing (\u03c6 \u2228 p) \u2227 (\u03c8 \u2228 p) by (\u03c6 \u2228 p) \u2227 (\u03c8 \u2228 p) \u2227 (\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8) under the proviso that \u03c6 and \u03c8 do not contain respectively a literal and its negation, and that \u03c6\u2228 \u03c8 is not absorbed by a clause already present.\nIn the dual context of disjunctive normal forms, the operations analogous to resolution and absorption are known respectively as consensus and subsumption.\nTheorem 4.4 (Blake, 1937; Samson, Mills, 1954; Quine, 1955\u201359; see [3, 18 ]). In order to obtain the Blake canonical form of a formula f it suffices to take any conjunctive normal form \u03a6\u0303 logically equivalent to f and to transform it by applying repeatedly the operations of absorption and resolution until no further application is possible (which happens after a finite number of steps).\nRemarks\n1. In order to check a given conjunctive normal form \u03a6\u0303 for its being prime, it is a matter of deriving the Blake canonical form \u03a6 by following the procedure of absorption and resolution and checking whether \u03a6 contains all the clauses of \u03a6\u0303 ; in other words, checking that none of the original clauses disappears by absorption in the process.\n2. According to the special convention (D3) adopted at the end of \u00a7 2.1, we systematically supplement the Blake canonical form with all the tertium non datur clauses (which are neutral elements for the operation of resolution, and are prime under the assumption (D2) of absence of unit clauses). Under this convention, in the definition of the operation of resolution one can drop the proviso that \u03c6 and \u03c8 must not contain respectively a literal and its negation; in fact, in this case \u03c6\u2228\u03c8 is absorbed by one the tertium non datur clauses. The context will always make clear whether we mean the standard Blake canonical one or the supplemented one.\n4.2 Disjoint resolution. In some cases the Blake canonical form can be quite long. In fact, it is well known that generally speaking its length can grow exponentially in the number of variables. This raises the question whether there are shorter prime conjunctive normal forms \u2217-equivalent to it. Generally speaking, it need not be so. A simple example is the conjunctive normal form \u03a6\u0303 = (p \u2228 q \u2228 r) \u2227 (p \u2228 r \u2228 s), for which one can easily check that the Blake canonical form is \u03a6 = (p \u2228 q \u2228 r) \u2227 (p \u2228 r \u2228 s) \u2227 (p \u2228 q \u2228 s), and that v\u2217p > v\u0303 \u2217 p as soon as min(vq, vs) > max(vr, vr). Having said that, the next results identify certain situations where shorter conjunctive normal forms can be shown to be \u2217-equivalent to the Blake canonical form. In this"}, {"heading": "20 R. Camps, X. Mora, L. Saumell", "text": "connection, we will use the following terminology: A disjoint resolution means a resolution operation as above but with \u03c6 and \u03c8 having no literals in common. A conjunctive normal form will be called disjoint-resolvable when a suitable choice of which clauses to resolve at every stage allows to arrive at the Blake canonical form by only making use of disjoint resolution and absorption.\nProposition 4.5. Let \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0303 be conjunctive normal forms. If \u03a6 is obtained from \u03a6\u0303 by a single disjoint resolution operation, then v\u2217 = v\u0303\u2217 .\nProof. Clearly, D\u0303 \u2286 D . So Proposition 4.2 ensures that v\u0303\u2217 \u2264 v\u2217 . In order to prove the equality we will make use of the characterization of v\u2217 given by Theorem 3.3: v\u2217 is the lowest valuation w that satisfies w\u2032 = w \u2265 v . So, we will be done if we show that the latter conditions are satisfied when we put w = v\u0303\u2217 . From now on we fix w to mean v\u0303\u2217 . What we know is that w\u0303 \u2032 = w \u2265 v , where in principle w\u0303 \u2032 differs from w\u2032 in that they use different conjunctive normal forms. So the problem reduces to showing that w\u2032 = w\u0303 \u2032 .\nNow, the two conjunctive normal forms in consideration differ only in that D = D\u0303 \u222a {C\u2217} , where C\u2217 = (C\u03031 \\ {q}) \u222a (C\u03032 \\ {q}) with C\u03031, C\u03032 \u2208 D\u0303 containing respectively q and q . Clearly, w\u2032p cannot differ from w\u0303 \u2032 p except for p \u2208 C\u2217 , in which case we have\nw\u2032p = max ( w\u0303 \u2032p , min\n\u03b1\u2208C\u2217 \u03b1 6=p\nw\u03b1\n) . (23)\nSo we should show that\nmin \u03b1\u2208C\u2217 \u03b16=p\nw\u03b1 \u2264 w\u0303 \u2032p, \u2200p \u2208 C\u2217. (24)\nThe hypothesis of disjoint resolution means that either p \u2208 C\u03031 \\ {q} or p \u2208 C\u03032 \\ {q} , but not both. The two cases are analogous to each other, so we will consider only the second one. In order to obtain (24) we begin by noticing that\nmin \u03b1\u2208C\u2217 \u03b1 6=p w\u03b1 = min ( min \u03b1\u2208C\u03031 \u03b1 6=q \u03b1 6=p w\u03b1 , min \u03b1\u2208C\u03032 \u03b1 6=q \u03b1 6=p w\u03b1 ) . (25)\nNow, since we are assuming p /\u2208 C\u03031 , we have\nmin \u03b1\u2208C\u03031 \u03b16=q \u03b16=p w\u03b1 = min \u03b1\u2208C\u03031 \u03b1 6=q\nw\u03b1 \u2264 w\u0303 \u2032q = wq, (26)\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 4 21\nwhere we used that w\u0303 \u2032 = w . Finally, by plugging (26) into (25) we get\nmin \u03b1\u2208C\u2217 \u03b1 6=p\nw\u03b1 \u2264 min ( wq , min\n\u03b1\u2208C\u03032 \u03b1 6=q \u03b1 6=p\nw\u03b1\n) = min\n\u03b1\u2208C\u03032 \u03b1 6=p\nw\u03b1 \u2264 w\u0303 \u2032p, (27)\nas desired.\nCorollary 4.6. Any disjoint-resolvable prime conjunctive normal form is \u2217-equivalent to the Blake canonical form.\nProof. Let \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0303 denote respectively the Blake canonical form and a disjoint-resolvable prime conjunctive normal form. Since we can go from \u03a6\u0303 to \u03a6 via disjoint resolution and absorption, Propositions 4.5 and 4.2 ensure that v\u2217 \u2264 v\u0303\u2217 . On the other hand, the reverse inequality is guaranteed by Proposition 4.3, since the disjoint resolvability of \u03a6\u0303 certainly ensures that \u03a6\u0303 is logically equivalent to \u03a6.\nRelated to the preceding results, one can see that disjoint resolvability ensures not only \u2217-equivalence, but also equivalence with respect to the property of definite consistency of a partial truth assignment:\nProposition 4.7. A partial truth assignment is definitely consistent for a disjoint-resolvable conjunctive normal form if and only if it is definitely consistent for the corresponding Blake canonical form.\nProof. Let \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0303 denote respectively the Blake canonical form and a disjoint-resolvable conjunctive normal form. The claim that definite consistency with \u03a6\u0303 implies definite consistency with \u03a6 follows from the easily checked fact that definite consistency is preserved by the operations of absorption and disjoint resolution. The converse implication is a simple consequence of the definition of the Blake canonical form, which ensures that every clause of \u03a6\u0303 contains, as a set of literals, some clause of \u03a6.\nRemark. The definition of disjoint resolvability implies going through (a special form of) the process of generating the Blake canonical form. On the other hand, the latter is also required for checking whether a given conjunctive normal form is prime. It would certainly be very interesting to be able to recognise these properties without having to go through the process of generating the Blake canonical form."}, {"heading": "22 R. Camps, X. Mora, L. Saumell", "text": "4.3 Getting there in a single step. Since the Blake canonical form of a doctrine contains all of its prime implicates, one might think that this conjunctive normal form will always lead to v\u2217 in a single step, that is v\u2217 = v\u2032 . Generally speaking, however, it need not be so.\nA simple example is the doctrine\n(p \u2228 q \u2228 r) \u2227 (q \u2228 r). (28)\nThis conjunctive normal form is already the Blake canonical form, since the two clauses in it are related to each other by a double opposition, which precludes the operation of resolution. The one-step revision transformation is as follows:\nv\u2032p = max ( vp,min(vq, vr) ) , v\u2032p = vp, (29)\nv\u2032q = max ( vq,min(vp, vr) ) , v\u2032q = max (vq, vr), (30)\nv\u2032r = max ( vr,min(vp, vq) ) , v\u2032r = max (vr, vq), (31)\nUsing these equations, one easily checks, for instance, that the valuation (vp, vq, vr; vp, vq, vr) = (.0, .4, .0; .0, .6, .3) results in (v \u2032 p, v \u2032 q, v \u2032 r; v \u2032 p, v \u2032 q, v \u2032 r) = (.3, .4, .0; .0, .6, .4) and (v\u2032\u2032p , v \u2032\u2032 q , v \u2032\u2032 r ; v \u2032\u2032 p , v \u2032\u2032 q , v \u2032\u2032 r ) = (.4, .4, .0; .0, .6, .4), where v \u2032\u2032 p is strictly larger than v\u2032p .\nA doctrine whose Blake canonical form does not satisfy v\u2217 = v\u2032 may raise suspicion. This is indeed the case of the doctrine (28). Let us see why. By composing the transformation (29\u201331) with itself one gets\nv\u2032\u2032p = max ( vp,min(vq, vr),min(vq, vq),min(vr, vr),min(vr, vq) ) . (32)\nNow, for the numerical values given after (29\u201331), the maximum of the righthand side of (32) is achieved by the term min(vq, vq). This is quite embarrasing, since it corresponds to deriving belief about p from the unsatisfiable conjunction q \u2227 q , which goes against the proviso stipulated in principle (P). One can argue that (32) is the result of two steps that separately comply with that condition. However, one cannot but remain somehow unconvinced.\nA sufficient condition for having v\u2217p = v \u2032 p is provided by the following result. From now on, we use the notation C \u2228 q C \u2032 to represent a set of the form (C \\ {q}) \u222a (C \u2032 \\ {q}).\nTheorem 4.8. Let us assume that the following condition is satisfied for a given p \u2208 \u03a0 :\nFor any C,C \u2032 \u2208 D and q \u2208 \u03a0 \\ {p} satisfying p, q \u2208 C and q \u2208 C \u2032 ,\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 4 23\none has either (a) or (b) or both of them:\n(a) there exists C1 \u2208 D such that p \u2208 C1 \u2286 C \u2228q C \u2032 ; (b) v\u2217p > min\u03b1\u2208C\u2228 q C\u2032 \\ {p} v\u2217\u03b1 .\nIn such a situation one is ensured to have v\u2217p = v \u2032 p .\nProof. We will argue by contradiction. More specifically, we will assume v\u2217p = v (n) p > v (n\u22121) p with n \u2265 2, and we will see that it leads to contradiction. The formula that defines v (n) p allows us to write\nv\u2217p = max C\u2208D C3p min \u03b1\u2208C \u03b1 6=p v (n\u22121) \u03b1 = min \u03b1\u2208C0 \u03b1 6=p v (n\u22121) \u03b1 , (33)\nwhere C0 stands for any clause that realizes the maximum of the middle expression. In the sequel we will refer to such a clause as a \u2018realizer\u2019. For every realizer C0 it will be useful to consider the following partition of it: C0 = {p}\u222aC\u03070\u222aC\u03080 , where C\u03070 and C\u03080 are formed by those literals \u03b1 \u2208 C0\\{p} that satisfy respectively v\n(n\u22122) \u03b1 < v \u2217 p and v (n\u22122) \u03b1 \u2265 v\u2217p . By taking into account\nthat v(n\u22121) \u2265 v(n\u22122) , one easily checks that\nv\u2217p = min (\nmin \u03b1\u2208C\u03070\nv (n\u22121) \u03b1 , min \u03b1\u2208C\u03080 v (n\u22122) \u03b1\n) . (34)\nFor C\u03070 = \u2205 , the right-hand side of (34) reduces to the expression whose maximization defines v\n(n\u22121) p , which gives v\u2217p \u2264 v (n\u22121) p , in contradiction to\nour assumption. Therefore, our aim will be reached if we show that for any realizer C0 with C\u03070 6= \u2205 , either the equality (34) leads itself to contradiction, or there exists another realizer C1 with the property that C\u03071 is strictly contained in C\u03070 , which would lead to the empty set in a finite number of steps.\nSo, let C0 be a realizer with C\u03070 6= \u2205 , and let q be any element of C\u03070 . Similarly to (33), we can write\nv (n\u22121) q = max\nC\u2208D C3q min \u03b1\u2208C \u03b1 6=q\nv (n\u22122) \u03b1 = min\n\u03b1\u2208C\u20320 \u03b16=q\nv (n\u22122) \u03b1 , (35)\nwhere C \u20320 stands for any clause that realizes the maximum of the middle expression. By introducing (35) in (34), we get\nv(n)p = min (\nmin \u03b1\u2208C\u03070\\{q}\nv (n\u22121) \u03b1 , min \u03b1\u2208C\u03080 v (n\u22122) \u03b1 , min\n\u03b1\u2208C\u20320 \u03b1 6=q\nv (n\u22122) \u03b1\n) .

Therefore, the three expressions between inequality signs in (38) are in fact equal to each other, which entails that C1 is a realizer. On account of the definition of C\u03071 and the equality v (n) p = v\u2217p , the obtained equality entails also that C\u03071 \u2286 C1 \u2229 C\u03070 \u2282 C\u03070 , where the last inclusion is strict since q \u2208 C\u03070 but q /\u2208 C1 . So, C1 is indeed a realizer with C\u03071 strictly contained in C\u03070 .\nRemarks\n1. Condition (b) is satisfied whenever one has v\u2217p > min\u03b1\u2208C\\ {p} v \u2217 \u03b1 , which\ninvolves neither C \u2032 nor q .\n2. The strategy of the preceding proof is akin to the SL-resolution procedure of logic programming.\nFor some doctrines whose Blake canonical form does not satisfy v\u2217 = v\u2032 one can still see that suspicious derivations of belief, i. e. from unsatisfiable conjunctions, are never behind the decision of accepting or rejecting certain literals. An interesting example is what can be called the doctrine of existence and uniqueness:\u2228\np\u2208\u03a0+\np, (39)\np \u2228 q, for any two different p, q \u2208 \u03a0+. (40)\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 4 25\nThat is, some p \u2208 \u03a0+ is true, and not two of them are true at the same time. Notice that the Blake canonical form contains nothing more than these clauses, since no resolution is possible. Let us assume that a particular p \u2208 \u03a0+ is accepted, that is v\u2217p > v\u2217p . In contrast to what happened for the doctrine (28), here we can see that v\u2217p is always strictly larger than min(v \u2217 q , v \u2217 q ) \u2014and therefore strictly larger than min(vq, vq)\u2014 for any q \u2208 \u03a0+ . In fact, on the one hand, the inequality v\u2217p > v \u2217 p obviously implies v \u2217 p > min(v \u2217 p, v \u2217 p). On the other hand, for any q \u2208 \u03a0+ \\ {p} , the invariance of v\u2217 by the transformation v 7\u2192 v\u2032 allows to write v\u2217p > v\u2217p \u2265 v\u2217q \u2265 min(v\u2217q , v\u2217q ), where the central inequality comes from the implication q \u2192 p , which is contained in (40).\nThese arguments can be generalized into the following result:\nCorollary 4.9. Let us assume that the following condition is satisfied for a given p \u2208 \u03a0 :\nFor any C,C \u2032 \u2208 D and q \u2208 \u03a0 \\ {p} satisfying p, q \u2208 C and q \u2208 C \u2032 , one has either (a) or (b \u2032 ) or both of them: (a) there exists C1 \u2208 D such that p \u2208 C1 \u2286 C \u2228q C \u2032 ; (b \u2032 ) there exists C2 \u2208 D such that p \u2208 C2 \u2286 (C \\ {p} \u222a {p}) \u2228q C \u2032 .\nIn such a situation, v\u2217p > v \u2217 p implies v \u2217 p = v \u2032 p ; therefore, p is never accepted on the basis of unsatisfiable conjunctions.\nProof. It suffices to show that condition (b \u2032 ) allows to go from the inequality v\u2217p > v \u2217 p to that of condition (b) of the preceding theorem. In fact, the invariance of v\u2217 by the transformation v 7\u2192 v\u2032 allows to write v\u2217p > v\u2217p \u2265 min\u03b1\u2208C2\\{p} v \u2217 \u03b1 \u2265 min\u03b1\u2208C\u2228\nq C\u2032 \\ {p} v\n\u2217 \u03b1 .\nOne easily checks that the hypothesis of the preceding corollary is satisfied by any literal in the doctrine of existence and uniqueness, but not by literal p in the doctrine (28).\nFrom now on, all revised valuations will be assumed to be computed on the basis of the Blake canonical form of the doctrine under consideration (or any \u2217-equivalent prime conjunctive normal form), this form being supplemented with all tertium non datur clauses. Since we are dealing with prime forms, having the equality v\u2217p = v \u2032 p guarantees that the degree of belief v \u2217 p does not derive from unsatisfiable conjunctions. When this equality holds for any initial valuation v , we will say that the doctrine under consideration is unquestionable for p. If this is the case for any literal p , then we will say simply that the doctrine is unquestionable. As we have been seeing,"}, {"heading": "26 R. Camps, X. Mora, L. Saumell", "text": "sometimes the equality v\u2217p = v \u2032 p can fail to hold for certain valuations v , but one can still guarantee that it holds whenever p is accepted according to v\u2217 ; in that case we will say that the doctrine is unquestionable for p when accepted.\nThe following extendability result can be seen as a good property of unquestionable doctrines with respect to the notion of definite consistency of a partial truth assignment:\nTheorem 4.10. For an unquestionable doctrine, every definitely consistent partial truth assignment v can be extended to a consistent total truth assignment u. Furthermore, for any literal p that is undecided by v one can choose u so that up = 1.\nProof. Let us begin by extending v to w with the values wp = 1 and wp = 0. Let us consider now the transformed valuation w\u2032 . For any q with wq = 1 one has certainly w\u2032q = 1. We claim that for such a q one has also w \u2032 q \u2264 12 . In fact, since wq = 1 \u2212 wq = 0, the only way to get the contrary, that is w\u2032q = 1, would be having a clause C with q \u2208 C and w\u03b1 = 1 for any \u03b1 \u2208 C \\ {q} . Therefore, we would have w\u03b1 = 0 for any \u03b1 \u2208 C . Since w\u03b1 differs from v\u03b1 only for \u03b1 = p, p , and wp = 1, we get v\u03b1 = 0 for all \u03b1 \u2208 C except possibly one undecided literal (namely p), which contradicts the assumed definite consistency of v .\nLet us consider now the valuation v\u0302 = \u00b5(w\u2032), where it should be recalled that \u00b5(w\u2032) means the partial truth assignment that represents the basic decision associated with w\u2032 . The preceding arguments entail that v\u0302 is an extension of w , and therefore it is also an extension of v . On the other hand, the unquestionability of the doctrine ensures that w\u2032 = w\u2217 , and Corollary 3.7 ensures that v\u0302 = \u00b5(w\u2032) = \u00b5(w\u2217) is definitely consistent. Since v\u0302 contains strictly less undecided literals than v , and the set of literals is finite, it is clear that iterating this procedure will eventually produce a consistent total truth assignment.\n4.4 Definite Horn doctrines. A conjunctive normal form \u03a6(D) is said to have a definite Horn character when every clause C \u2208 D contains exactly one element of \u03a0+ . This property is easily seen to be preserved by the operations of absorption and resolution. As a consequence, it is inherited by the corresponding Blake canonical form. So, the latter has a definite Horn character if and only if there exists a logically equivalent conjunctive normal form with the same property. In such a situation, we can say that we are dealing with a definite Horn doctrine. As we will see, for such doctrines one\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 4 27\ncan arrive at consistent decisions by means of another criterion besides the one given at the end of \u00a7 2.2.\nFor a definite Horn doctrine, the restriction of v\u2217 to \u03a0+ is easily seen to depend only on the restriction of v to \u03a0+ . More generally, this happens when every clause C \u2208 D contains at most one element of \u03a0+ , in which case one speaks of a (simple) Horn character. In contrast, the properties below require a definite Horn character.\nProposition 4.11. For a definite Horn doctrine one has\nmax p\u2208\u03a0+ v\u2217p \u2264 max q\u2208\u03a0+ vq. (41)\nProof. The result follows from Proposition 3.8 by taking u in the following way: up = 1 and up = 0 for any p \u2208 \u03a0+ . The consistency of this truth assignment is an immediate consequence of the doctrine having a definite Horn character.\nFor definite Horn doctrines, one can arrive at definitely consistent decisions by considering only the restriction of v\u2217 to \u03a0+ . For every \u03b7 in the interval 0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 1 we define the unilateral decision of margin \u03b7 in the following way: For any p \u2208 \u03a0+ ,\np is accepted and p is rejected whenever v\u2217p > \u03b7, (42) p is rejected and p is accepted whenever v\u2217p < \u03b7, (43) p and p are left undecided whenever v\u2217p = \u03b7. (44)\nTheorem 4.12. For a definite Horn doctrine, and any \u03b7 in the interval 0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 1, the unilateral decision of margin \u03b7 associated with the upper revised valuation is always definitely consistent.\nProof. According to the definition of definite consistency, we have to show that for each C \u2208 D and every p \u2208 C , if all \u03b1 \u2208 C \\ {p} are rejected, then p is accepted. To this effect, we will show that assuming p not accepted and all \u03b1 \u2208 C \\ {p} rejected leads to contradiction. Now, for a definite Horn doctrine all clauses have the form C = {r} \u222a S , with r \u2208 \u03a0+ and S \u2282 \u03a0+ . Since v\u2217 is ensured to satisfy the inequalities (8), we can write\nv\u2217r \u2265 min s\u2208S v\u2217s (45)"}, {"heading": "28 R. Camps, X. Mora, L. Saumell", "text": "In order to arrive at the desired contradiction we will distinguish two cases: (a) p = r ; and (b) p \u2208 S .\nCase (a): p = r . In this case, p = r not accepted means that v\u2217r \u2264 \u03b7 , and all \u03b1 \u2208 C \\ {p} rejected means all s \u2208 S accepted, i. e. v\u2217s > \u03b7 . By plugging these inequalities in (45) we arrive at the false conclusion that \u03b7 > \u03b7 .\nCase (b): p \u2208 S . In this case, r is rejected, so that v\u2217r < \u03b7 , and the s \u2208 S are either accepted or not rejected, so that v\u2217s \u2265 \u03b7 . Therefore, we also arrive at the false conclusion that \u03b7 > \u03b7 .\nCompared with the bilateral decision criterion (4\u20135), the unilateral one (42\u201344) leaves much less room for undecidedness. For the bilateral criterion, increasing \u03b7 has the effect of thickening the region of undecidedness. In contrast, for the unilateral criterion it has only the effect of moving the boundary. This happens at the expense of disregarding the evidence in favour of p for p \u2208 \u03a0+ . So, the unilateral criterion may accept p in spite of a stronger evidence in favour of p , or it may reject p in spite of p having a weaker evidence than p . On the other hand, the extent of such discrepancies is limited as stated in the following result:\nProposition 4.13. The unilateral decisions associated with a definite Horn doctrine are related to the bilateral ones in the following ways: (a) For any p \u2208 \u03a0+ satisfying vp + vp \u2265 1, if p is accepted [resp. not rejected ] by the bilateral decision of margin \u03b7 , then p is accepted [resp. not rejected ] by the unilateral decision of margin (1+\u03b7)/2. (b) For any p \u2208 \u03a0+ , if p is accepted [resp. not rejected ] by the unilateral decision of margin \u03b7 \u2265 \u03b70 , then p is also accepted [resp. not rejected ] by the bilateral decision of margin \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b70 , where \u03b70 := maxq\u2208\u03a0+ vq .\nProof. In order to obtain part (a) it suffices to notice that vp + vp \u2265 1 implies v\u2217p + v \u2217 p \u2265 1 and therefore v\u2217p \u2265 [ (v\u2217p\u2212v\u2217p) + 1 ] / 2. Part (b) is a consequence of the inequality v\u2217p \u2212 v\u2217p \u2265 v\u2217p \u2212 \u03b70 , which follows immediately from (41).\n4.5 Autarkic sets. A set \u03a3 \u2282 \u03a0 will be said to be autarkic for a conjunctive normal form \u03a6(D) when it has the following properties: (a) \u03a3 does not contain at the same time a literal p and its negation p ; (b) for any clause C \u2208 D , if C contains p for some p \u2208 \u03a3 , then C contains also some q \u2208 \u03a3 . Such a situation arises also in satisfiability theory, where one calls then autarkic the partial truth assignment u that sets up = 1 and up = 0 for p \u2208 \u03a3 and up = 12 (undecided) for p \u2208 \u03a0 \\ (\u03a3 \u222a \u03a3) [20 ].\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 4 29\nAgain, the property of autarky is preserved by the operations of absorption and resolution (checking it is a little exercise). As a consequence, it passes on to the corresponding Blake canonical form. So, \u03a3 \u2282 \u03a0 is autarkic for the latter if and only if it is autarkic for some logically equivalent conjunctive normal form. In such a situation, we can say simply that \u03a3 is autarkic for the given doctrine.\nFor a definite Horn doctrine, \u03a0+ is easily seen to be an autarkic set. This is a particular case of the following more general fact: if u is a truth assignment consistent with D , then \u03a3 = {\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0 | up = 1 } is an autarkic set. Generally speaking, however, autarkic sets need not decide on every issue. Even so, their definition allows for the following generalization of Proposition 3.8:\nProposition 4.14. An autarkic set \u03a3 has the property that\nmax p\u2208\u03a3 v\u2217p \u2264 max q\u2208\u03a3 vq. (46)\nProof. Since v\u2217 is obtained by iterating the transformation v 7\u2192 v\u2032 , it suffices to show that this transformation has the following property analogous to (46): v\u2032p \u2264 maxq\u2208\u03a3 vq for any p \u2208 \u03a3 . This follows immediately from (7) because, by definition, \u03a3 being autarkic requires every clause C that contains p with p \u2208 \u03a3 to contain also some q \u2208 \u03a3 , which ensures that min\u03b1\u2208C,\u03b16=p v\u03b1 \u2264 maxq\u2208\u03a3 vq .\nTheorem 4.15. Assume that the original valuation satisfies\nmin p\u2208\u03a3 vp \u2212 max p\u2208\u03a3 vp > \u03b7, (47)\nfor some autarkic set \u03a3 and some \u03b7 \u2208 [0, 1). In this case, the decision of margin \u03b7 associated with the upper revised valuation v\u2217 accepts every proposition in \u03a3 .\nProof. By combining (46), (47) and part (c) of Theorem 3.2, it follows that\nmin p\u2208\u03a3 v\u2217p \u2212 max p\u2208\u03a3 v\u2217p > \u03b7, (48)\nwhich implies v\u2217p \u2212 v\u2217p > \u03b7 for any p \u2208 \u03a3 ."}, {"heading": "30 R. Camps, X. Mora, L. Saumell", "text": "Theorem 4.16. Assume that the original valuation satisfies\nvp = 1, vp = 0, for any p \u2208 \u03a3 , (49)\nwhere \u03a3 is an autarkic set. In this case, the upper revised valuation v\u2217 has the following properties: (a) For any p \u2208 \u03a3 one has also v\u2217p = 1 and v\u2217p = 0. (b) For any q \u2208 \u03a0 such that neither q nor q belongs to \u03a3 , the upper revised value v\u2217q coincides with the value which is obtained for a modified doctrine that leaves out any clause that contains some element of \u03a3 \u222a\u03a3 .\nProof. Part (a) is a direct consequence of Proposition 4.14 and part (c) of Theorem 3.2. In order to prove part (b) it suffices to show that one can leave out the clauses that contain some element of \u03a3 ; in fact, by the definition of an autarkic set, those that contain an element of \u03a3 are ensured to contain also some element of \u03a3 . The statement of part (b) will be obtained by showing that it holds for all the iterates v (n) q with n \u2265 1. In this connection, we will make use of the fact that v (n) p = 0 for any p \u2208 \u03a3 and any n \u2265 0, which follows from part (a) because of the inequality v \u2264 v(n) \u2264 v\u2217 . Let us assume that neither q nor q belongs to \u03a3 . Recall that v (n) q is given by\nv(n)q = max C\u2208D C3q min \u03b1\u2208C \u03b16=q v (n\u22121) \u03b1 . (50)\nWe claim that the value that results from this formula is not altered if the max operator of the right-hand side forgets about any clause C that contains some p in \u03a3 . In fact, we know that v\n(n\u22121) p = 0 and p 6= q (because of the\nassumption that q 6\u2208 \u03a3 ). Therefore, we get min\u03b1\u2208C,\u03b16=q v\u03b1(n\u22121) = 0, which entails that claim.\n4.6 Duality. The lower revised valuation \u2217v announced in \u00a7 2.4 is obtained by means of a dual method \u2014somehow it might be more appropriate to say \u2018codual\u2019\u2014 which is based on the fact that the doctrine, i. e. (1) being true, provides the following implications originated at p (which should be compared to (3) ):\np \u2192 \u2228 \u03b1\u2208C \u03b1 6=p \u03b1, (51)\nfor any C \u2208 D such that p \u2208 C . Such implications can be dealt with by means of a principle dual to (P) that can be stated in the following way:\n(Q) Consider an implication of the form p \u2192 \u2228 \u03b1\u2208\u03a3 \u03b1 with \u03a3 \u2282 \u03a0 .\nAs soon as the right-hand side is not always satisfied, this implication\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 5 31\nrestricts the degree of belief of p to be less than or equal to the maximum degree of belief of the disjuncts \u03b1 .\nThis leads to a downward revision of the degrees of belief according to the transformation v \u2192 \u2032v defined by the formula\n\u2032vp = min C\u2208D C3p max \u03b1\u2208C \u03b1 6=p v\u03b1, (52)\nwhose iteration leads to the lower revised valuation \u2217v .\nEquivalently, \u2217v is given by the formula \u2217vp = 1\u2212 v\u0302\u2217p , where v\u0302 is related to v by the formula v\u0302p = 1 \u2212 vp ( v\u0302 believes p to the extent that v does not believe p). This characterization allows to obtain the results for \u2217v from those for v\u2217 .\nWhen v is a balanced valuation, then \u2217vp = 1 \u2212 v\u2217p , so that \u2217vp \u2212\u2217vp = v\u2217p \u2212 v\u2217p . Therefore, the upper and lower revised valuations lead then exactly to the same decisions."}, {"heading": "5 Application to specific domains", "text": "In this section we apply the preceding ideas and results to three specific domains. Unfortunately, there is no space in this article for developing other applications."}, {"heading": "5.1 One proposition being equivalent to the conjunction of two", "text": "other ones. This is the problem with which we started the article, i. e. \u03a0+ = {p, q, t} with the doctrine t \u2194 (p \u2227 q). By rewriting the connective \u2194 in terms of \u2227,\u2228,\u00ac , one easily arrives at the corresponding Blake canonical form, which has a definite Horn character:\n(p \u2228 q \u2228 t) \u2227 (p \u2228 t) \u2227 (q \u2228 t) (53)\nThe one-step revision transformation, which uses the clauses above and also the tertium non datur ones, is given by\nv\u2032p = max (vp, vt), v \u2032 p = max (vp,min(vq, vt)), (54) v\u2032q = max (vq, vt), v \u2032 q = max (vq,min(vp, vt)), (55) v\u2032t = max (vt,min(vp, vq)), v \u2032 t = max (vt, vp, vq). (56)\nOne easily sees that the equality v\u2217 = v\u2032 holds whenever v satisfies the following inequalities: vt \u2264 vp , vt \u2264 vq , vt \u2265 vp , vt \u2265 vq . More particularly,"}, {"heading": "32 R. Camps, X. Mora, L. Saumell", "text": "it holds whenever v is an aggregate of several components satisfying all of these inequalities. When the component valuations are all-or-none and noncontradictory \u2014i. e. satisfying v\u03b1+v\u03b1 \u2264 1 for any \u03b1\u2014 these inequalities hold whenever these valuations are definitely consistent. Under this assumption \u2014that is quite reasonable in the jury scenario of \u00a7 1.1\u2014 the doctrine (53) is therefore unquestionable in the sense of \u00a7 4.3. In the general case, one has only v\u2217 = v\u2032\u2032 .\nAs a particular example, let us consider the following aggregate of consistent truth assignments:\n(vp, vq, vt; vp, vq, vt) = .30 (1, 1, 1; 0, 0, 0) + .40 (1, 0, 0; 0, 1, 1) (57)\n+ .25 (0, 1, 0; 1, 0, 1) + .05 (0, 0, 0; 1, 1, 1)\n= (.70, .55, .30; .30, .45, .70).\nAs one can see, these collective degrees of belief result in the inconsistent decision of accepting both p and q but rejecting t . In contrast, the corresponding upper revised valuation, namely\n(v\u2217p, v \u2217 q , v \u2217 t ; v \u2217 p, v \u2217 q , v \u2217 t ) = (.70, .55, .55; .55, .70, .70), (58)\nresults in the consistent decision of accepting p and rejecting both q and t . This decision holds up to a margin of .15, above which all three issues are left undecided. The classical example of \u00a7 1.1 results in all upper revised values being equal to exactly the same value, namely 2\n3 , so that all three issues are\nthen undecided even for a vanishing margin. All of this is in agreement with the concept of definite consistency defined in \u00a7 2.2.\n5.2 Equivalence relation on a set A. Here the set of atomic propositions is \u03a0+ = { exy | x, y \u2208 A, x 6= y } , where exy stands for the proposition \u2018x is equivalent to y \u2019. In order to follow the standard definition of an equivalence relation, one should include also the propositions exx , and constrain them to being true; however, this goes against our convention (D2) of avoiding unit clauses, which is why the definition of \u03a0+ considers only pairs xy with x 6= y . The doctrine requires that for any pairwise different x, y, z \u2208 A one must have: exy \u2227 eyz \u2192 exz (transitivity) and exy \u2192 eyx (symmetry). This is equivalent to identifying exy with eyx and adopting the following clauses:\nexy \u2228 eyz \u2228 exz, for any pairwise different x, y, z \u2208 A. (59)\nThis doctrine has a definite Horn character and has the following autarkic sets: \u03a0+ itself; \u03a0\u2212 = { exy | x, y \u2208 A, x 6= y } ; \u03a3a = { eax | x \u2208 A, x 6= a } for any a \u2208 A .\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 5 33\nWe claim that this doctrine is disjoint-resolvable in the sense defined in \u00a7 4.2, and that its Blake canonical form, with the tertium non datur clauses included, consists of all clauses of the form\nex0x1 \u2228 ex1x2 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 exn\u22121xn \u2228 ex0xn , (60)\nwith n \u2265 1 and all xi (0 \u2264 i \u2264 n) pairwise different (which restricts n to be less than or equal to the number of elements of A). In the following we will refer to such sequences x0x1 . . . xn as non-cyclic paths from x0 to xn , and a generic non-cyclic path will be denoted by means of the greek letter \u03b3 . In order to establish the preceding claim it suffices to check that: (i) starting from (59) one can arrive at (60) for any non-cyclic path by using only disjoint resolution; and (ii) any further resolution does not add any new clause (i. e. the would-be new clause is absorbed by some clause of the form (60) ). The last statement can also be strengthened to show that condition (a) of Thm. 4.8 is satisfied for any of the propositions exy and exy . As a consequence, v\u2217 coincides with the result of applying once the transformation v 7\u2192 v\u2032 determined by the Blake canonical form, which makes this doctrine unquestionable in the sense of \u00a7 4.3.\nMore particularly, the values of v\u2217(exy) can be obtained by considering all possible non-cyclic paths \u03b3 from x to y and applying the formula\nv\u2217(exy) = max \u03b3 min 0\u2264i<n v(exixi+1). (61)\nThese values are easily seen to satisfy\nv\u2217(exz) \u2265 min (v\u2217(exy), v\u2217(eyz)) for any x, y, z . (62)\nAs one can easily check, this inequality is a necessary and sufficient condition for the following binary relations E\u03b7 (0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 1) to be equivalence relations:\nxy \u2208 E\u03b7 \u2261 v\u2217(exy) \u2265 \u03b7. (63)\nThese facts are closely related to the definite consistency of the unilateral decisions of margin \u03b7 considered in \u00a7 4.4. In fact, one can easily check that: E\u03b7 coincides with the set of pairs xy such that exy is accepted by an unilateral decision of margin smaller but near enough to \u03b7 , and that this decision is definitely consistent if and only if E\u03b7 is an equivalence relation. Obviously, the equivalence relations E\u03b7 become progressively finer as \u03b7 grows (i. e. \u03b7 < \u03b6 implies E\u03b6 \u2286 E\u03b7 in the sense of subsets of A\u00d7A). What we are obtaining is the so-called single-link method of cluster analysis [13 : 7.3 ]. This method is usually formulated in terms of the \u201cdissimilarities\u201d dxy = 1\u2212v(exy)"}, {"heading": "34 R. Camps, X. Mora, L. Saumell", "text": "and d\u2217xy = 1 \u2212 v\u2217(exy). The inequality (62) corresponds to the inequality d\u2217xz \u2264 max(d\u2217xy, d\u2217yz) that defines the so-called \u201cultrametric\u201d distances. The characterization given by Theorem 3.3 corresponds to the well-known fact that the ultrametric distance given by the single-link method is characterized by the property of being \u201csubdominant\u201d to the original dissimilarities d [13 : 8.3 ]. When looking at these correspondences, one must bear in mind that in cluster analysis it is customary to consider the parameter \u03b4 = 1\u2212 \u03b7 rather than \u03b7 .\nHowever, all of this is achieved at the expense of disregarding any evidence for exy , independently of its being stronger or weaker than the evidence for exy . In contrast, the bilateral criterion looks at the balance of these evidences. The values of v\u2217(exy), which are required to this effect, can be obtained by considering non-cyclic paths \u03b3 from x to y with the special feature that exactly one of the links is marked as negative; the formula to be applied is similar to (61) but v(exixi+1) is replaced by v(exixi+1) for the link that is marked as negative:\nv\u2217(exy) = max \u03b3 max 0\u2264k<n min 0\u2264i<n { v(exixi+1), if i 6= k; v(exixi+1), if i = k.\n(64)\nBy the way, from (61) and (64) it is clear that having v(exy) < v(exy) for any two different x, y \u2208 A implies the same property for v\u2217 , which ensures that the basic decision associated with v\u2217 accepts exy for all x, y ; this improves upon the result contained in Theorem 4.15 for \u03b7 = 0.\nIn contrast to the unilateral criterion, the bilateral one does not result in a complete hierarchy of equivalence relations going all the way from a single class of equivalence to as many classes as objects being classified. Instead, one obtains a hierarchy where the coarsest equivalence (corresponding to \u03b7 = 0) may already be made of several classes.\nThis provides a form of cluster analysis where dissimilarity is not simply the lack of similarity, but it plays its own role. In particular, this acts against falling into the \u2018stringy\u2019 clusters typical of the unilateral single-link method. Besides, this point of view is also especially suitable for dealing with missing data.\n5.3 Total order on a set A. Here, \u03a0+ = { pxy | x, y \u2208 A, x 6= y } , where pxy stands for the proposition \u2018x is preferred to y \u2019. The doctrine requires that for any pairwise different x, y, z \u2208 A one must have: pxy \u2227 pyz \u2192 pxz (transitivity), pxy \u2192 pyx (asymmetry) and pxy \u2192 pyx (completeness).\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 6 35\nIn normal form, they read as follows:\npxy \u2228 pyz \u2228 pxz, for any pairwise different x, y, z \u2208 A; (65) pxy \u2228 pyx, for any two different x, y \u2208 A; (66) pxy \u2228 pyx, for any two different x, y \u2208 A, (67)\nwhere the last one does not have a Horn character.\nSimilarly to the case of an equivalence relation, this doctrine is also disjoint\u2013resolvable and unquestionable. Its Blake canonical form, with the tertium non datur clauses included, consists of all clauses of the form\npx0x1 \u2228 px1x2 \u2228 . . . \u2228 pxn\u22121xn \u2228 px0xn , (68)\nwhere x0x1 . . . xn is a non-cyclic path, together with all clauses that are obtained from (68) by replacing one or more pxixi+1 by pxi+1xi , and/or replacing px0xn by pxnx0 (i. e. by identifying pxy with pyx for any two different x, y \u2208 A).\nLet us remark also that applying Theorem 4.10 to this domain gives the finite case of the well-known theorem of Edward Szpilrajn about the extendability of partial orders to total orders [26 ].\nIn this case, our general method corresponds essentially to the voting method introduced in 1997 by Markus Schulze [24 , 25 ; 27 : p. 228\u2013232 ], often called the method of paths. More precisely, when the original valuation is balanced \u2014which happens when every voter expresses a comparison (a preference or a tie) about each pair of options\u2014 we coincide with Schulze\u2019s method except for his subsequent treatment of indecisions; when the preferential information given by the voters is not complete, this procedure does not coincide exactly with any of the variants that Schulze gives in [25 ], but it has the same spirit. For more details, we refer the reader to [4, 5 ], where it is shown that this procedure can be extended to a continuous rating method that allows to sense the closeness of two candidates at the same time that it allows to recognise certain situations that are quite opposite to a tie.\nHere we will only draw attention to significance of certain autarkic sets of this doctrine. In fact, one can easily check the autarkic character of any set of the form \u03a3 = { pxy | x \u2208 X, y \u2208 A \\ X } , where X is any proper subset of A . Applied to such sets, Theorem 4.15 ensures that the method of paths satisfies the following majority property [4 : Thm. 10.1; 5 : Thm. 8.1 ]: If for each member of X and every member of A \\ X there are more than half of the individual votes where the former is preferred to the latter, then the resulting social ranking also prefers each member of X to every member of A \\X ."}, {"heading": "36 R. Camps, X. Mora, L. Saumell", "text": ""}, {"heading": "6 Discussion and interpretation of the results", "text": "6.1 The variant that we have chosen as the main one is crucially based upon the principle (P) stated in \u00a7 3.1: An implication of the form p\u2190 \u2227 \u03b1\u2208\u03a3 \u03b1 with a satisfiable right-hand side gives to p at least the same degree of belief as the weakest of the conjuncts \u03b1 . This principle goes back to ancient philosophy,where it was stated by saying that peiorem semper conclusio sequitur partem. In more recent times, this idea has been brought back by several authors in connection with different theories of degrees of belief. For a recent overview of the subject, we refer to [12 ] and the articles therein.\nAssuming that the doctrine is specified by means of a prime conjunctive normal form, the above-mentioned principle allows to replace any given belief valuation v by at least the v\u2032 given by the max-min formula (7). In this connection, it must be emphasized that the max operator of (7) does not hinge on the dual principle (Q) of \u00a7 4.6. Instead, it appears simply as a result of having several implications leading to p : being greater than or equal to several values certainly implies being greater than or equal to the greatest of them.\nThe valuation v\u2032 obtained in this way is greater than or equal to the original one v because we have systematically included the implications p \u2190 p (through the tertium non datur clauses p\u2228 p). By iterating the transformation v 7\u2192 v\u2032 we arrive at the invariant valuation v\u2217 that we call upper revised valuation. For a fixed prime conjunctive normal form, v\u2217 is characterized as the lowest of the valuations w that lie above v and satisfy the invariance equation w\u2032 = w (Theorem 3.3). On the other hand, when we consider different prime conjunctive normal forms, all of them logically equivalent to a given doctrine, then v\u2217 is greatest when we take the Blake canonical form, that is, the prime conjunctive normal form composed of all the prime implicates (Proposition 4.3). The fact that the revised valuation v\u2217 satisfies the equality v\u2217\u2032 = v\u2217 can be seen as a general form of consistency with the doctrine; in particular, it entails that the decisions based upon the differences v\u2217p \u2212 v\u2217p are always definitely consistent (Corollary 3.7).\nThe dual variant works in a similar way, but the non-decreasing transformation v 7\u2192 v\u2032 is replaced by a non-increasing one v 7\u2192 \u2032v . The resulting lower revised valuation \u2217v is characterized as the greatest of the valuations w that lie below v and satisfy the invariance equation \u2032w = w . Somehow, it would be appropriate for a skeptic believer, whereas the upper revised valuation would correspond to an easy believer.\nMany of the above underlying ideas can be found somewhere in the literature. Among the works closest to ours we can mention that of Nicholas\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 6 37\nRescher about plausible reasoning [23 ]. However, and making abstraction of certain differences in the setup, that work can be seen as starting from a valuation w that already satisfies the equality w\u2032 = w (which follows from [23 : p. 15, (P4) ] because of the tertium non datur clauses); even so, the consistency of the decisions based upon the differences wp\u2212wp = v\u2217p \u2212 v\u2217p is not obtained as a theorem, but it forms part of an axiom [23 : p. 16, (P6) ]. On the other hand, the transformation w \u2192 w\u2032 is still used \u2014[23 : p. 19 ]\u2014 but only as a means for extending the initial valuation to any compound proposition with a zero initial value (which extension is done in a single step).\nIn contrast to Rescher and other authors, the valuations considered in the present work are defined only for the members of \u03a0 , i. e. the basic propositions and their negations. In so doing, we take the view that any issue of interest is included in \u03a0 , as a pair formed by an atom and its negation, and that its logical connection to the other issues is specified by suitable clauses in the doctrine.\nSince it involves only the max and min operators, the transformation v \u2192 v\u2032 , and therefore also the transformation v \u2192 v\u2217 , have a purely ordinal character: The ordering of \u03a0 by v\u2217 depends only on its ordering by v . In particular, the basic decision associated with v\u2217 is based wholly on comparisons. However, one cannot say the same about the decisions that require a certain positive margin. Such decisions make sense only for valuations that have a cardinal character, as in the case of judgment aggregation, where vp means the fraction of people who consider p true. Another result whose meaningfulness requires cardinal valuations is the property of continuity stated in part (a) of Theorem 3.2. By the way, this property ensures that the accepted propositions remain accepted when the valuation v undergoes slight variations.\nBesides its making sense in the aggregation of individual judgments, belief adjustment may already be taking place to some extent within every individual. This is somehow unavoidable if the individuals are required to produce consistent judgments, as it is usually the case. In particular, this means that the individuals are already allowing some issues to influence the others. In view of this, it is quite reasonable to dispense the aggregation method from complying with the condition of issue-by-issue aggregation considered in \u00a7 1.3.\nOur method disregards the condition of issue-by-issue aggregation but complies with the following condition of respect for consistent majority decisions: If the majority criterion applied to the original valuation v decides on each issue and is consistent with the doctrine, then this decision is respected (Theorem 3.9). Majority is here understood as having vp > 1 2 > vp (rather"}, {"heading": "38 R. Camps, X. Mora, L. Saumell", "text": "than simply vp > vp ). Furthermore, we have also a property of respect for unanimity (Theorem 3.11): if a particular proposition is accepted by every individual, and the individual judgments are consistent, then that proposition is also accepted by the collective judgment. Another good property is the monotonicity given by Theorem 3.14.\nDeciding about logically constrained issues, \u00a7 6 39\n6.2 The fractional degrees of belief form a continuum of possibilities that stretches over the all-or-none framework of classical logic. This allows for p and p not being exactly the semantic negation of each other, but rather the opposite, or antithesis, of each other. One may object that this is not compatible with the excluded-middle principle p\u2228p . However, this principle somehow loses its character just as fractional valuations come in. In fact, its role in connection with the latter is only through the excluded-middle clauses that we systematically include in the Blake canonical form; and this has only the following two effects: (a) providing the trivial implications p \u2192 p and p \u2192 p , through which the upper revised degrees of belief become larger than or equal to the original ones; (b) forbidding any implication of the form p \u2227 p \u2227 \u03c7 \u2192 t , which would be a gratuitous source of belief. Effect (b) occurs because clauses are restricted to be prime, which prevents them from containing p \u2228 p .\nWhen p is the opposite of p rather than its denial, then intermediate degrees of belief can somehow be identified with belief in intermediate possibilities of fact. For instance, if p means \u2018white\u2019 and p means \u2018black\u2019 \u2014and even more if p means \u2018rather white\u2019 and p means \u2018rather black\u2019\u2014 then (wp, wp) = (0.3, 0.7) can be interpreted as giving belief to the gray that combines white and black in the given proportions. When the valuation is not balanced, then we are adding a sort of intensity of belief that can go from a full lack of opinion to a self-contradictory one.\n6.3 Let us look back on the special problem of collegial courts with which we started the article. As we did in \u00a7 1.1 and \u00a7 5.1, we take as archetype the doctrine t\u2194 p \u2227 q , where t means \u2018being guilty\u2019 of a certain offence.\nThe data are the fractions of the jury who adhere to each of the propositions in question and their respective negations. These numbers can certainly be viewed as degrees of collective belief. The problem is that the decision that is naturally associated to this valuation, namely accepting \u03b1 , and rejecting \u03b1 , whenever v\u03b1 > v\u03b1 , may be inconsistent with the doctrine. This may happen even when each member of the jury is expressing a consistent opinion. Thus, in the particular case of the doctrine t\u2194 p\u2227 q we have seen examples of consistent individual judgments that result in having at the same time vp > vp and vq > vq (guilty by the standard premise-based criterion) but vt < vt (not guilty by the standard conclusion-based criterion).\nIn contrast, the revised valuation v\u2217 has the property that the associated decision is always definitely consistent with the doctrine in the sense defined in \u00a7 2.2. In particular, for the doctrine t \u2194 p \u2227 q one is ensured to have v\u2217p > v \u2217 p and v \u2217 q > v \u2217 q (guilty by the revised premise-based criterion) if and only if v\u2217t > v \u2217 t (guilty by the revised conclusion-based criterion)."}, {"heading": "40 R. Camps, X. Mora, L. Saumell", "text": "Of course, it may well happen that v\u2217\u03b1 = v \u2217 \u03b1 , which does not allow to decide between \u03b1 and \u03b1 . Such equalities are somehow easier to happen than the analogous ones for the original valuation v . However, they can be ruled out in the case of a unanimous consistent belief in \u03b1 (Theorem 3.11), and also, by continuity, if we are near enough to such unanimity.\nThe process that leads from the original degrees of belief v to the revised ones v\u2217 can be seen as a quantitative virtual deliberation in accordance with the implications contained in the doctrine and with principle (P).\nThe suitability of a process of this kind in the context of law courts was advocated by L. Jonathan Cohen in his celebrated book The Probable and the Provable [6 ].\nFor the doctrine t\u2194 p\u2227 q , the process of deliberation goes not only from p and q to t , but also the other way (which makes it somewhat inappropriate to call p and q the \u2018premises\u2019 and t the \u2018conclusion\u2019). Letting the implications t \u2192 p and t \u2192 q to come in conforms to the point of view expressed by Kornhauser and Sager in [16 ]: \u201cIn actual deliberation, our commitments to outcomes may sometimes be more basic and fundamental than our commitment to the \u2018principles\u2019 or \u2018reasons\u2019 that ostensibly support them.\u201d\nThe existence of such a direct belief about t makes p and q not independent from each other. Such a situation could be avoided by submitting p and q to the consideration of two separate juries (so that vt = vt = 0). In such a setting, if both juries have the same number of members and none of the jurors abstains, then the basic decision according to v\u2217 can be seen to coincide with the standard premise-based one.\nAnother aspect where our method matches the standard principles of law is the fact that the decision about t is obtained from a balance between the arguments for t and those for t . In fact, this is the main idea of the adversarial system of justice that operates in most jurisdictions. More specifically, our basic decision criterion, i. e. that of margin 0, would correspond to the notion of \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d, also known as \u201cbalance of probabilities\u201d, that defines the standard of proof usually adopted in civil cases. In contrast, the standard of proof \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d typical of criminal cases would correspond to a (perhaps unilateral) decision criterion of margin \u03b7 , with \u03b7 near enough to 1."}, {"heading": "42 R.

In contrast to other works about belief revision, here the constraints are assumed to be fixed.

The upper [resp. lower] revised degrees of belief are uniquely characterized as the lowest [resp. greatest] ones that are invariant by a certain max-min [resp. min-max] operation determined by the logical constraints. In both variants, making balance between the revised degree of belief of a proposition and that of its negation leads to decisions that are ensured to be consistent with the logical constraints. These decisions are ensured to agree with the majority criterion as applied to the original degrees of belief whenever this gives a consistent result. They are also ensured to satisfy a property of respect for unanimity about any particular issue, as well as a property of monotonicity with respect to the original degrees of belief.
