Introduction", "text": "The study of latent dimensions in a corpus of electronic messages has been part of the research agenda from different disciplinary perspectives. In linguistics, for example, these efforts have been focused under the label of \u201clatent semantic analysis\u201d (LSA; Landauer et al., 1998); in communication studies, \u201cframing\u201d is a leading theoretical concept for studying the latent meanings of observable messages in their contexts (e.g., Scheuffele, 1999); and in social-systems theory and socio-cybernetics, codes of communication which can be symbolically generalized (Parsons, 1963a and b; 1968; Luhmann, 1995 and 2002; Leydesdorff, 2007) are expected to operate latently or virtually as \u201ca duality of structure\u201d (Giddens, 1984; Leydesdorff, 2010). These efforts have in common that the analyst shifts his/her attention from the communication of information in observable networks to the communication of meaning in latent dimensions.\nLatent dimensions can be operationalized as the \u201ceigenvectors\u201d of a matrix representing the network under study. Eigenvectors, however, operate in a vector space that can be considered as the architecture spanned by the variables (vectors) in observable networks. Statistical techniques for analyzing latent dimensions such as factor analysis and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) are well-known to the social scientist\u2014and where further developed for the purpose of analyzing communication (Lazarsfeld & Henry, 1968)\u2014but the current enthusiasm for network analysis and graph theory has tended to push aside these older techniques in favour of a focus on observable networks and their structures. Spring-embedded algorithms that operate on networks such as Kamada & Kawai (1989) or Fruchterman & Reingold (1991) are integrated in software\npackages freely available at the internet such as Pajek and Gephi. These newer visualization capacities far outreach the traditional ones such as MDS. 1\nIn this introduction, we show how one can use these newer visualization techniques with the older factor-analytic approach for distinguishing main dimensions in order to visualize the communication of meaning as different from the communication of information. The communication of information can be considered as the domain of social network analysis and its semantic pendant in traditional co-word analysis (Callon et al., 1983; 1986). Words and cowords, however, cannot map the development of the sciences (Leydesdorff, 1997). The architectures of the discourse have first to be analyzed and can then also be visualized. Using an example, we walk the user through the different steps which lead to a so-called Pajek-file which can be made input to a variety of visualization programs.\nIn other words, we provide a step-by-step introduction that enables the user to generate and optimize network visualizations in the vector space, that is, the space in which meaning is communicated as different from the communication of information in the network. Meaning can be generated when informations are related at a systems level. In cybernetics, one often invokes an \u201cobserver\u201d to this end (Edelman, 1989; Von Foerster, 1982), but a discourse can also be considered as a relevant system of reference. Note that meaning is provided in terms of expectations and can be informed and updated by observations. The various bits of informations can be positioned in a vector space in addition to being related or not in terms of network\n1 VosViewer, a visualization program available at http://www.vosviewer.org, reads Pajek files as input, but uses an algorithm akin to MDS (Van Eck et al., 2010).\nrelations (Burt, 1982). The absence of relations can then be as informative as their presence (Burt, 1995; Granovetter, 1973).\nThe software for the visualization and animation of the vector space uses the cosine values of the angles between the vectors (variables) of word occurrences in distributions. We explain below how the word-document matrix can additionally be used as input to the factor analysis; for example, in SPSS. Unlike \u201csingle value decomposition\u201d (SVD) which has been the preferred method in latent semantic analysis, factor analysis is available in most social-science statistics programs. We developed software so that one can move from a set of textual messages (either short messages or full texts) to these different software packages and take it further from there."}, {"heading": "2. The framing concept", "text": "The concept of framing was introduced by Goffman (1974). He explained that messages in the mass media are \u201cframed,\u201d which means that a description is provided from a certain perspective and with a specific interpretation. McCombs (1997) described framing as \u201cthe selection of a restricted number of thematically related attributes for inclusion on the media agenda when a particular object is discussed\u201d (pp. 297-298). Van Gorp (2007) indicated that this process of selection is inevitable, as journalists are unable to provide an objective image of reality. McQuail (2005, at p. 379) agreed on this inevitability, which results in the inclusion of a specific way of thinking into the process of communication. Entman (1993) also argues that this process of selection can either be conscious or unconscious. A certain way of thinking is transmitted through the text. As Entman (1993, at p. 52) argued:\nFraming essentially involves selection and salience. To frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem, definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation for the item described. (p. 52)\nA fact never has a meaning in itself, but it is formed by the frame in which it is used (Gamson, 1989). This latent meaning is implied by focusing on certain facts and by ignoring others. Frames appear in four different locations in the communication process: at the sender, within the text itself, with the receiver, and within culture (Entman, 1993).\nWhen studying frames through the methods described below, one focuses on the frames that are embedded within the texts. These frames are often powerful, as changing a specific frame by a source might be interpreted by relevant audiences as inconsistent or unreliable (since dissonant). Textual frames are formed, among other things, by the use of certain key words and their relations. The relations among keywords provide the basis for this methodology.\nMatthes and Kohring (2008) distinguished five methodological approaches to the measurement of media frames. First, in the qualitative Hermeneutic approach, frames are identified by providing an interpretative account of media texts linking up frames with broader cultural elements. Secondly in the Linguistic approach, one analyzes the selection, placement, and structure of specific words and sentences in a media text. A third model is provided by the Manual holistic approach. Frames are generated through a qualitative analysis of texts, after\nwhich they are coded in a manual quantitative content analysis. In the Deductive approach, fourthly, frames are theoretically derived from the literature and then coded in a standard content analysis. Lastly, the authors identify a fifth and methodological approach: the Computer-assisted approach. An example of this latter approach is elaborated in this study. In this approach, frame mapping can be used as a method of finding particular words that occur together. As frames then are generated by computer programs, instead of being \u201cdiscovered\u201d by the researcher(s), this method has the advantage of being a more objective tool for frame extraction than the other methods."}, {"heading": "3. The dynamics of frames", "text": "Through the research methods described in this study, one is able to study differences or changes in frames within different discourses, not only statically, but also dynamically. Danowski (2007) studied changes in frames from the perspective of language. He indicated that frames relate to the way that facts are characterized, which is based on cultural and social backgrounds. This is consistent with the vision of Scheufele (1999), who stated that the influence of media on the public mainly works through transferring the importance of specific aspects about a certain issue. Framing is considered by Danowski (2007, 2009) as a way of shaping the process of agenda setting. He also states that framing is mainly applied to provide a positive or negative view on an issue. Unlike Entman (1993), Danowski (2007) argued that frames change relatively rapidly in the media. Discourse in the public domain would have a character more versatile and volatile than scholarly discourse. This contrast makes it interesting to study changing frames within specific discourses.\nOur research method provides also a way of studying these possible differences in the dynamics. The existing network visualization and analysis program Visone was further developed for this purpose with a dynamic extension (at http://www.leydesdorff.net/visone). The network files for the different years can be assembled with a routine mtrx2paj.exe which is available with some instruction from http://www.leydesdorff.net/visone/lesson8.htm. An in-between file (named \u201cpajek.net\u201d) can be harvested and also be read by other network animators such as SoNIA: Social Network Image Animator or PajekToSVGAnim.Exe (Leydesdorff et al., 2008). In this study, however, we limit ourselves to the multi-variate decomposition of a semantic network in a static design (including comparative statics). An example of the potential of the dynamic extension to Visone showing heterogeneous networks in terms of their textual representations (\u201cactants\u201d) can be found at http://www.leydesdorff.net/callon/animation/ which was made for a Liber Amicorum at the occasion of the 65 th birthday of Michel Callon (Leydesdorff, 2010b).\nWhen analyzing frames, one can make a distinction between restricted and elaborated discourses. Graff (2002) indicates that this distiction is mostly related to the audience of the communication. In restricted discourse, one single and specific meaning is constructed and reproduced. This is, for example, important in scholarly communication, when the audience in a particular field of studies has specific knowledge on the topics of communication. In elaborated discourse, communication is aimed at a wider audience. In this case, multiple meanings are created and translated into one another. The visualization of the frames in the collection of messages to be analyzed can reveal a more elaborated versus a more restricted type of discourse (Leydesdorff & Hellsten, 2005)."}, {"heading": "4. Using semantic maps for the study of frames", "text": "The research method presented in this section deals with content analysis of collections of messages. In addition to manual content analysis (Krippendorff, 1980; Krippendorff & Bock, 2009), one can use computer programs to generate semantic maps on the basis of large sets of messages. A properly normalized semantic map can be helpful in detecting latent dimensions in sets of texts. By using statistical techniques, it is possible to analyze the structure in semantic networks and to color them accordingly.\nContent can be contained in a set of documents, a sample of sentences, or any other textual units of analysis. In our design, the textual units of analysis will be considered as the cases, and the words in these messages\u2014after proper filtering of the stopwords\u2014as the variables. Thus, we operate with matrices. Matrices which contain words as the variables in the columns and textual units of analysis as cases in the rows (following the convention of SPSS) are called word/document matrices. In co-word analysis and social network analysis, one often proceeds to the symmetrical co-occurrence matrix, but this latter matrix contains less information than the asymmetrical word/document matrix (Leydesdorff & Vaughan, 2006).\nWhen visualizing a word/document matrix, a network appears, containing the interrelationships among the words and the textual units. In order to generate this network, one needs to go through various stages using different programs. In this section we explain how to generate, analyze, and\nvisualize semantic maps from a collection of messages using the various programs available at http://www.leydesdorff.net/indicators and standard software such as SPSS and Pajek."}, {"heading": "4.1. Generating the word/document occurrence matrix", "text": "In order to generate the word/document occurrences matrix, one first needs to save a set of messages in such a format that the various programs to be used below are able to use them as input files. If the messages are short (less than 1000 characters), we can save them as separate lines in a single file using Notepad or another text editor. 2 This file has to be called \u201ctext.txt\u201d. In this case one can use the program Ti.exe (available at http://www.leydesdorff.net/software/ti) that analyzes title-like phrases. If the messages are longer, the messages need to be saved as separate text-files, named text1.txt, text2.txt, etc. 3 These files can be read by the program FullText.exe (at http://www.leydesdorff.net/software/fulltext/)."}, {"heading": "4.1.1. Frequency List", "text": "The text-file text.txt can directly serve as input for the program Frequency List (FrqList.exe at http://www.leydesdorff.net/software/ti). This program produces a word frequency list from the file text.txt, needed for assessing which words the analyst wishes to include in the word/document occurrences matrix. As a rule of thumb, more than 75 words are difficult to\n2 If one uses Word or WordPad, one should be careful to save the file as a so-called DOS plain text file. When prompted by Word, choose the option to add CR/LF to each line. (CR/LF is an old indication of Carriage returns and Line feeds, like using a typewriter.) 3 Sometimes, Windows adds the extension .txt automatically. One should take care not to save the files with twice the extension \u201c.txt.txt\u201d. The programs assume only a single \u201c.txt\u201d and will otherwise lead to an error.\nvisualize on a single map, and more than 255 variables may be difficult to analyze because of systems limitations in SPSS and Excel 2003.\nTogether with the text-file, one can use a standard list of stopwords in order to remove the irrelevant words directly from the frequency list. It can be useful to check the frequency list manually, to remove potentially remaining stopwords. If we begin with long texts in different files (text1.txt, text2.txt, \u2026 etc.), 4 these files have first to be combined into a single file text.txt that can be read by FrqList, for the purpose of obtaining a cumulative word frequency list across these files. 5 The use of FrqList is otherwise strictly analogous.\nTo be able to run FrqList, one needs to install the program in a single folder with the Text-file with all the messages (text.txt) and the list of stopwords, as shown in Figure 1.\n4 Sample files text1.txt, text2.txt, text3.txt, text4.txt can be found at http://www.leydesdorff.net/software/fulltext/text1.txt , etc. 5 One can combine these files in Notepad or alternatively by opening a DOS box. In the DOS box, use \u201ccd\u201d for changing to the folder which contains the files and type: \u201ccopy text*.txt text.txt\u201d. Make sure to erase an older version of text.txt first.\nAfter running, the program FrqList produces a frequency list: the combined word frequency list is made available as WRDFRQ.txt in the same folder, as can be seen in Figure 2. This file can be read into Excel in a next step so that, for example, the single occurrences of words can be discarded from further analysis."}, {"heading": "4.1.2. Full Text", "text": "The next step is to import the frequency list\u2014one can use wrdfrq.dbf or wrdfrq.txt\u2014into an Excel file in order to separate the words from the frequencies as numerical values. At this stage, the list of words may be too long to use efficiently. To be able to visually interpret the data at a later stage, it can be advised to use a maximum of approximately 75 words. The first 75 words from the frequency list (without the frequencies) need to be saved as a Text-file by the name of\nwords.txt. (Use Notepad for saving or obey the conventions for a plain DOS text as above.) This file \u201cwords.txt\u201d can serve as input for the programs Ti.exe or FullText.exe.\nOne can use ti.exe for the case that the texts are short (< 1000 characters) and organized as separate lines in a single file text.txt, but fulltext.exe is used in the case of a series of longer text files named text1.txt, text2.txt, text3.txt, \u2026, etc. Both programs need in addition to the information in the textual units, an input file named words.txt (in the same folder) with the information about the words to be included as variables. Prepare this file carefully using the instructions about removing stopwords and making selections specified above. You may wish to run FrqList.exe a second time with a manually revised file stopword.txt. (Save this file as a DOS file!)\nAs can be seen in Figure 3, the separately saved messages (text1.txt, text2.txt, etc.), together with the file words.txt, form the input for FullText. (Analogously, for Ti.exe one needs the files\ntext.txt and words.txt.) The program produces data files, which can be used as input for the statistical program SPSS and the network visualization program Pajek. By installing the program FullText in the same folder containing the saved messages and words.text, the program can be run. The output of FullText can also be found in this same folder, as can be seen in Figure 4.\nPrior to running FullText, the program demands to insert the file name (\u201cwords\u201d) and the number of texts. After running FullText (or Ti.exe), one can use the files matrix.txt 6 and labels.sps to statistically analyze the word/document occurrence matrix by using SPSS. (The file matrix.txt contains the data and can be read by SPSS. The file labels.sps is an SPSS syntax file for labelling the variables with names.) In order to generate a visualization of the semantic map, one can use the file cosine.dat as input to Pajek. How to use these files for Pajek and SPSS will be discussed in the next paragraph.\n6 Matrix.txt contains the same information as matrix.dbf. Matrix.dbf can directly be used with more than 256 variables in Excel 2007 and higher, but not in lower versions. In SPSS this depends on the version."}, {"heading": "4.2. Analyzing the word/document occurrence matrix", "text": "As noted, the file matrix.txt can be read by SPSS. To label the variables with names, choose \u201cFile \u2013 Open \u2013 Syntax\u201d in order to read the file labels.sps. Choose \u201cRun \u2013 All\u201d. As can be seen in the syntax file, FullText has deleted the \u201cs\u201d at the end of the words. The aim is to remove the plural forms, but this may have no use when analyzing a word/document occurrence matrix. By comparing to the original words in the file WRDFRQ.txt (which was generated by FrqList) the labels in the variable view of SPSS can be manually adapted. This is only necessary if one wants to use the words as labels; for example, in a table of the SPSS output. When visualizing the word/document occurrence matrix, as we explain below, the words can be adapted for use in Pajek at a later stage."}, {"heading": "4.2.1. Factor analysis", "text": "In order to analyze the word/document occurrence matrix in terms of its latent structure, one may wish to conduct a factor analysis in SPSS. The factor analysis can demonstrate which words belong to which components. Prior to the factor analysis one has to calculate the variance of the variables (the words from the matrix). Words with a variance of zero cannot be used in a factor analysis and therefore need to be left out of the process. (The variance can be computed in SPSS by choosing \u201cAnalyze \u2013 Descriptive Statistics \u2013 Descriptives\u201d, then selecting all the words into the right column and then ticking \u201cVariance\u201d under \u201cOptions\u201d.)\nThe next step is analyzing the data by means of a factor analysis. Choose \u201cAnalyze \u2013 Data Reduction \u2013 Factor\u201d in SPSS. This step is visualized in Figure 5. Select all the variables in the left column, except the ones with a variance of zero, and select them to the right column. Then, under \u201cExtraction\u201d, tick \u201cScree plot\u201d and undo \u201cUnrotated factor solution\u201d. Then, under \u201cRotation\u201d, tick \u201cVarimax\u201d and \u201cLoading plot(s)\u201d and finally, under \u201cOptions\u201d, tick \u201cSorted by size\u201d and \u201cSuppress absolute values lower than\u201d, which is by default set at larger than .10.\nUnder Extraction it is additionally possible to manually choose the number of factors. When the output of the factor analysis produces too many factors, it may be advised to manually set the number of factors on, for example, six. More than six factors may be difficult to visualize and interpret through Pajek at a later stage.\nThe options are now set in order to conduct a factor analysis. SPSS produces several tables and figures in the output. The most relevant for our purpose is the Rotated Component Matrix. This matrix shows the number of components (factors) and the loading of the different words on the components. At this stage, one can arrange the words under the different components, which can be used when visualizing the word/document occurrence matrix in the next stage. In Figure 6 an example of a few words are visualized with the arrangement under de different components. The\nvarious components can be considered as representations of different frames used in these texts. In the example in Figure 6, the texts are built around three different frames. How to use the output to visualize the word/document occurrence matrix will be discussed in the next section.\nIn addition to the positive factor loading, one may also wish to take into account that \u201clevel\u201d has a negative loading (-.94) on Factor 3."}, {"heading": "4.2.2. Cronbach\u2019s alpha", "text": "Prior to the visualization of the matrix, one may wish to conduct a reliability analysis, by calculating Cronbach\u2019s alpha (\u03b1) for each frame (component). This measure controls after the factor analysis whether the frames form a reliable scale. First, one can determine which words belong to which frames by using the output of the factor analysis in SPSS, like the example in Figure 6.\nThe next step is the calculation of Cronbach\u2019s alpha in SPSS, by choosing \u201cAnalyze \u2013 Scale \u2013 Reliability Analysis\u201d. Select the words from the first frame into the right column and run the reliability analysis by choosing \u201cOK\u201d. Figure 7 shows the output of this analysis with Cronbach\u2019s alpha for the example from Figure 6, using the second frame which was composed of nine items (that is, words as variables).\nIn the example in Figure 7, Cronbach\u2019s Alpha has a value of .95. In order to guarantee the internal consistency of the scale, Cronbach\u2019s Alpha needs to have a minimal value of .65."}, {"heading": "4.3. Visualizing the word/document occurrence matrix", "text": "In this section we explain how to visualize the word/document occurrence matrix by using Pajek 7 and the output of the factor analysis in SPSS. In order to visualize the output of FullText, one is advised to use the file cosine.dat, which was generated by FullText (see chapter 2). 8 In the first part of this section the drawing of the figure is discussed. After that we explain how the visualization can be informed by the output of the factor analysis in SPSS. The final part of this section discusses the layout of the figure and how this can be changed.\nChoose \u201cFile \u2013 Network \u2013 Read\u201d to open the file cosine.dat in Pajek. To create a partitioned figure, one can choose \u201cNet \u2013 Partitions \u2013 Core \u2013 All\u201d. To draw the Figure, choose \u201cDraw \u2013 Draw partition\u201d. One can change the layout of the figure by choosing \u201cLayout \u2013 Energy \u2013 Kamada-Kawai \u2013 Free\u201d. In this stage, one has created a figure which shows the different components with different colors, as can be seen in Figure 8. However, the algorithm used in Pajek for attributing the colors is different from the results of the factor analysis. We will change this below.\n7 The latest version of Pajek can be downloaded at http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/ . 8 The cosine-normalized matrix can be compared to the Pearson correlation matrix which is used for the factor analysis, but without the normalization to the mean. Word-frequency distributions are usually not normally distributed and therefore this normalization to the mean is not considered useful for the visualization. The results of the factor analysis inform us about the latent dimensions which are made visible by the visualization as good as possible. Note that visualization is not an analytical technique.\nAs noted above and shown again in Figure 8, FullText automatically removes an \u201cs\u201d at the end of a word. Also in Pajek it is possible to put back the \u201cs\u201d, in case of an incorrect removal. To do so, close the Figure and choose \u201cFile \u2013 Partition \u2013 Edit\u201d in Pajek. In this window one can change the words manually. After closing the window and drawing the partitioned figure again, the words are changed. 9\nThe next step in visualizing the word/document occurrence matrix is the adjustment of the figure to the output of the factor analysis in SPSS, as discussed in the previous chapter. After the factor analysis in SPSS, each word was assigned to a specific frame. In the example, there were three different frames made visible in the output (Figure 6). In spite of the fact that Figure 8 also shows three frames in Pajek, there are differences between these frames and the frames from 9 Alternatively, one can change the words in the input file cosine.dat using an text editor such as Notepad.\nSPSS. These differences are being caused by the fact that Pajek uses the cosine matrix while SPSS uses the correlation matrix and performs an orthogonal rotation.\nThe visualization as shown in Figure 8 can be adjusted to the output of the factor analysis in SPSS. This adjustment can be done in the same way as the changing of the words in the previous section.

Nevertheless, the numbers are always oneto-one related to the colours of the vertices in the figure. As can be seen in Figures 8 and 9, it is\n10 In the Draw screen, Shift-Left click a vertex to increase its partition cluster number by one, Alt-Left click a vertex to decrease it by one.\ndifficult to read the words in the current layout of the figure. The different lines are also difficult to distinguish.\nThere are several options which can increase the readability of the figure. A few of these options are being introduced here. After following these steps, the figure will be better readable and interpretable. Figure 10 provides an overview of the adjustment options in Pajek.\nFigure 11 shows the same figure as in Figures 8 and 9 after passing through the preceding steps. The words can be read better and the differences in the loadings of the words can be interpreted.\nA final option to complete the above figure is the addition of the frames to the figure (using Word or a program like Paint). Through the different words it is possible to name the different frames. Figure 12 shows an example of this addition to the above figure."}, {"heading": "4.4. The discourse about \u201cautopoiesis\u201d visualized as an example", "text": "In this section, a short illustration of the research methodology is provided by visualizing the international discourse on autopoiesis. The set of messages consists of nine newspaper articles from various English language newspapers harvested from LexisNexis. 11 The messages were saved as seperate text-files, and the output of the programs Frequency List (FrqList.exe), Full Text (FullText.exe) and SPSS were used to serve as input for Pajek. In Figure 13 the word/document occurrence matrix and the factor analysis are visualized using Pajek.\n11 The Washington Post (2), The Australian (1), Calgary Herald (1), The Herald (Glasgow) (1), The Independent Extra (1) The New York Times (1), The Observer (1), and Prince Rupert Daily News (Britisch Columbia) (1).\nThe visualization of the discourse on autopoiesis provides an illustration of the use of this research methodology.

Limitations", "text": "Although this method has the advantage of being more objective in frame extraction than other methods, there are of course some limitations as well. First, Matthes and Kohring (2008) argued\nthat all computer-assisted methods in content analysis assume that words and phrases have the same meaning within every context. A human coder could be better able to detect all the different meanings in a text and to provide an interpretation to the contexts of the words. As Simon (2001) also describes, the computer cannot understand human language with all its subtlety and complexiveness. Our methods, however, allow for further extension using, for example, factorial complexity as an indicator of words having different meanings in\u2014translating between\u2014 different frames (Leydesdorff & Hellsten, 2005).\nSecond, one could argue that there is a problem of validity. Some words need to have a large frequency in order to occur in the analysis, in spite of being central to the content of the text (Hertog & McLeod, 2001). This can further be elaborated in terms of various statistics, such as \u201cterm frequency-inverse document frequencies\u201d (tf-idf; Salton & McGill, 1983) or the contribution of words (as variables) to the chi-square statistitics of the word/document occurrence matrix. After running ti.exe or fulltext.exe, the file words.dbf contains additional information with these statistics (which are further explained at http://www.leydesdorff.net/software/ti/index.htm; Leydesdorff & Welbers, 2011). Again, this is a problem that occurs as a result of the absence of the researcher in the process of frame abstraction. However, the researcher can manipulate the input file with words (words.txt) which will be used for the analysis.\nA final limitation is related to the sources of the media texts. This method can only be applied to texts that are electronically made available (Matthes & Kohring, 2008). As a result of this, visuals or handwritten texts cannot easily be used to study frames using this method. In spite of\nthese limitations, the computer assisted approach of studying frames, as discussed above, provides a relatively researcher-independent assessment of frames, while this objective is hard to accomplish using other methods."}, {"heading": "6. Future research directions", "text": "Our discussion has been oriented towards \u201cgetting started\u201d with Pajek for the visualization of latent frames in textual messages. The resulting output can be further embellished for presentation purposes using lesson 6 at http://www.leydesdorff.net/indicators. Other files at this same page use the same techniques for other purposes. For example, one can be interested in the cited references in texts and thus wish to make a citation matrix instead of a matrix of cooccurring words. The basic scheme is that of textual units of analysis (messages) to which a set of variables can be attributed. These variables can be words, author names, institutional addresses, cited references, etc. One can then generate the file matrix.txt and cosine.dat as described above, and use them for analysis in SPSS and/or visualization in Pajek.\nIn addition to the available statistics in SPSS, Pajek hosts a number of statistics which have been developed over the past few decades in social network analysis. We already mentioned above the k-core algorithm which groups together nodes (vertices) which are interrelated with at least k neighbours. An introduction to these statistics is provided by: Hanneman, R. A., & Riddle, M. (2005). Introduction to social network methods. Riverside, CA: University of California, Riverside; available at http://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/nettext/. An introduction to Pajek is\nprovided by: De Nooy, W., Mrvar, A., & Batagelj, V. (2005).

Conclusion", "text": "In our argument, semantics was considered as a property of language, whereas meaning is often defined in terms of use (Wittgenstein, 1953), that is, at the level of agency. Ever since the exploration of intersubjective \u201cmeaning\u201d in different philosophies (e.g., Husserl, 1929; Mead, 1934), the focus in the measurement of meaning has gradually shifted to the intrinsic meaning of textual elements in discourses and texts, that is, to a more objective and supra-individual level (Luhmann, 2002). The pragmatic aspects of meaning can be measured using Osgood et al.\u2019s (1957) Likert-scales and by asking respondents. Modeling the dynamics of meaning, however, requires further elaboration (cf. Leydesdorff, 2010).\nOur long-term purpose is modeling the dynamics of knowledge in scientific discourse. Knowledge can perhaps be considered as a meaning which is more codified than other meanings; it is generated when different meanings can further be compared and thus related (by an observer or in a discourse). As we noted above, meaning can be generated by an observer or in a discourse when different bits of (Shannon-type) information can be related and comparatively be selected. Thus, the selective operation can be considered as recursive. However, the generation of knowledge presumes the communication of meaning (Leydesdorff, 2011). As we have shown, the analysis of the latter requires the progression from the network space to the vector space. The current contribution is made to support the user by facilitating this important step."}], "references": [{"title": "Toward a Structural Theory of Action", "author": ["R.S.

We distinguish between the communication of information in the network space (social network analysis) and the communication of meaning in the vector space. The vector space can be considered a generated as an architecture by the network of relations in the network space; words are then not only related, but also positioned. These positions are expected rather than observed and therefore one can communicate meaning. Knowledge can be generated when these meanings can recursively be communicated and therefore also further codified.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2010"}}}
