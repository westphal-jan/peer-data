The S-proto system uses a simple arithmetic procedure to compute s-contains.\nTwo other types of arithmetic operations, s-contains and s-contains, are used to perform both the basic and complicated S-compactness.\nFigure 2 illustrates a set of basic S-proto s-contains, S-contains, and S-contains with a simple arithmetic procedure to compute s-contains.

Introduction", "text": "Inference under uncertainty is a common problem in the real world. Thus, for pieces of information from different sources, there always exist two fundamental aspects that to combine information and to exact information on a designated domain. Based on the above consideration, the valuation-based system (VBS) was first introduced by Shenoy. 1 Kohlas, in Ref. 2, has exactly introduced the concept of information algebra. We can see that information algebra is an algebraic structure links up with local computation and inference for treating uncertainty or, more\n\u2217Work Address: College of Mathematic Science, Xuzhou Normal University, Xuzhou, 221116, China.\n1\ngenerally, information and knowledge. It gives a basic mathematical model for describing the modes of information processing. Recent studies 2 3 4 showed that the framework of information algebra covers many instances from constraint systems, Bayesian networks, Dempster-Shafer belief functions to relational algebra, logic and etc.\nIn view of the feasibility of computer processing information, Kohlas gave the notions of domain-free compact information algebra and labeled compact information algebra successively in the study of representation of information algebras. In the light of the previous conclusions, we know that there exists a correspondence between domain-free information algebra and labeled information algebra, that is, from a domain-free information algebra, we can construct its associated labeled information algebra, and vice versa. But, labeled compact information algebras introduced in Ref. 3 do not necessarily lead to domain-free compact information algebras, as we have seen in the example of cofinite sets.3 It naturally raises a question that whether we can present an improved definition of labeled compact information algebra such that its associated domain-free information algebra is compact and strong compact respectively. Accordingly, in this paper, we redefine the notions of labeled continuous information algebra and domain-free continuous information algebra respectively. Obviously compact information algebras defined in the previous literature can be seen as a special case of continuous information algebras. As a result, the conclusions which are obtained in continuous information algebras are also more extensive. It should be noted that the definitions in this paper are different from continuous information algebra presented in Ref. 3. The main difference exists in the characterization of continuity in labeled information algebras.\nThe main work of this paper is as follows. Basing on the notions of continuous information algebras, we discuss the correspondence of continuity in labeled information algebras and domain-free information algebras. The accordance on scompactness in information algebras thus follows from the conclusions on continuity, that is, a labeled s-compact information algebra induces its associated domain-free s-compact information algebra and, in turn, a domain-free s-compact information algebra induces its associated labeled s-compact information algebra too. We also present the equivalent statements of some definitions introduced in the paper, and especially study the properties of function spaces of domain-free continuous information algebras.\nThe paper is organized as below. Section 2 briefly reviews some basic notions on information algebra. In Section 3 we introduce the concept of domain-free continuous information algebra and discuss the property of continuous function spaces. In Section 4 we give the notion of labeled continuous information algebra and focus on the relationship on continuity and compactness in labeled information algebras and domain-free information algebras."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "Let\u2019s recall some definitions and notations in the theory of information algebra. For a full introduction, we can refer to Ref. 2-6. In this study, the fundamental elements of an information algebra are valuations. In general, a valuation is a function that provides possible elements of a field for variables. Here a valuation represents some knowledge and information which may be a function, tuple or symbol.\nLet \u03a6 be a set of valuations, and let D be a lattice. Suppose there are three\noperations defined:\n1.Labeling: \u03a6 \u2192 D;\u03c6 7\u2192 d(\u03c6), where d(\u03c6) is called the domain of \u03c6. Let \u03a6s denote the set of all valuations with domain s.\n2.Combination: \u03a6\u00d7 \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6; (\u03c6, \u03c8) 7\u2192 \u03c6\u2297 \u03c8, 3.Marginalization: \u03a6\u00d7D \u2192 \u03a6; (\u03c6, x) 7\u2192 \u03c6\u2193x, for x \u2264 d(\u03c6). If the system (\u03a6, D) satisfies the following axioms, it is called a labeled infor-\nmation algebra:\n1.Semigroup: \u03a6 is associative and commutative under combination. For all s \u2208 D there is an element es with d(es) = s such that for all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 with d(\u03c6) = s, es\u2297\u03c6 = \u03c6. Here es is called a neutral element of \u03a6s.\n2. Labeling: For \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6, d(\u03c6\u2297 \u03c8) = d(\u03c6) \u2228 d(\u03c8). 3. Marginalization: For \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, x \u2208 D, x \u2264 d(\u03c6), d(\u03c6\u2193x) = x. 4. Transitivity: For \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 and x \u2264 y \u2264 d(\u03c6), (\u03c6\u2193y)\u2193x = \u03c6\u2193x 5. Combination: For \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6 with d(\u03c6) = x, d(\u03c8) = y, (\u03c6\u2297 \u03c8)\u2193x = \u03c6\u2297 \u03c8\u2193x\u2227y. 6. Stability: For x, y \u2208 D, x \u2264 y, e\u2193xy = ex. 7. Idempotency: For \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 and x \u2208 D, x \u2264 d(\u03c6), \u03c6\u2297 \u03c6\u2193x = \u03c6. The items putting forward in the above definition are the axiomatic presentations of some basic and logical principles in the process of handling information. In fact, the algebraic structure shown in the definition covers many instances from expert systems, constraint systems and possibility theory to relational algebra and logic. We now look at some examples of labeled information algebras.\nExample 1. (Constraint System) A constraint system 7 is a tuple CS = \u3008S,D, V \u3009, where \u3008S,+,\u00d7, 0, 1\u3009 is a semiring, V is a totally ordered set of variables via ordering \u227a. D is a finite set which contains at least two elements, called the domain of variables. A tuple \u3008S,+,\u00d7, 0, 1\u3009 is defined to be a semiring, if it satisfies that both operations + and \u00d7 are commutative and associative, and \u00d7 distributes over +. The element 0 is a unit element of + and an absorbing element of \u00d7, 1 is a unit element of \u00d7. A semiring S is called c-semiring,4 if it is such that for all a \u2208 S, a+ 1 = 1.\nA tuple c = \u3008def, con\u3009 is called a constraint over CS, where (i) con \u2286 V , it is called the type of the constraint, denoted by d(c) = con; (ii) def : D|con| \u2192 S, where |con| is the cardinality of con. Let C denote the set of all constraints over CS. Two operations are defined as\nfollows:\n1. Combination \u2297: For two constraints c1 = \u3008def1, con1\u3009, c2 = \u3008def2, con2\u3009, their combination, written c1 \u2297 c2, is the constraint \u3008def, con\u3009 with con = con1 \u222a con2\nand def : D|con| \u2192 S is defined as:\ndef(x) = def1(x \u2193con1)\u00d7 def2(x\u2193con2), \u2200x \u2208 D|con|,\nwhere x\u2193con1 , called tuple projection, is defined as follows: Suppose x = \u3008x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xk\u3009 \u2208 D|con|, con1 = {v \u2032 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , v \u2032\nm} \u2286 con = {v1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , vk}, where vi \u227a vj and v \u2032\ni \u227a v \u2032 j if i < j, then x \u2193con1 = \u3008t \u2032 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , t \u2032 m\u3009, where t \u2032 i = xj if v \u2032 i = vj .\n2. Projection \u21d3: For a constraint c = \u3008def, con\u3009, if I \u2286 con, the projection of c\nover I, written c\u21d3I , is the constraint \u3008def \u2032 , I\u3009 with\ndef \u2032 (x) = \u2211\nz\u2208D|con|:z\u2193I=x\ndef(z), \u2200x \u2208 D|I|.\nWith the three operations combination, projection and type, the system (C,P(V )) induced by a semiring S is a labeled information algebra if, and only if, the semiring S is such that a\u00d7 (a+ b) = a for all a, b \u2208 S.\nIn fact, if S satisfies with a \u00d7 (a + b) = a for all a, b \u2208 S, then S is a csemiring with the idempotent operation \u00d7.8 Hence (C,P(V )) is an information algebra.4 Conversely, let (C,P(V )) be an information algebra, a variable v \u2208 V , and D = {y1, y2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , yn}(n \u2265 2). If a, b \u2208 S, we take a constraint c = \u3008def, con\u3009, where con = {v} and def : D \u2192 S is defined as def(y1) = a, def(y2) = b and def(y) = 0 for all other y \u2208 D. By the idempotency of information algebra, we have c\u2297 c\u21d3\u2205 = c, then def(y1) = def(y1)\u00d7 \u2211\ny\u2208D\ndef(y), i.e., a\u00d7 (a+ b) = a.\nExample 2. (soft set) Let U be an initial universe set and let E be a set of parameters which usually are initial attributes, characteristics, or properties of objects in U . Let P(U) denote the power set of U and A \u2286 E. A pair (F,A) is called a soft set 9over U , where F is a mapping given by F : A \u2192 P(U). A soft set (F,A) over U is said to be a null soft set, if for all e \u2208 A,F (e) = \u2205.\nThere are three operations defined: 1. Labeling d: For a soft set (F,A), we define d((F,A)) = A. 2. Projection \u2193 10: If B \u2286 A, we define (F,A)\u2193B to be a soft set (G,B) such\nthat for all b \u2208 B, G(b) = F (b).\n3. Extended intersection \u2293 11: The extended intersection of two soft sets (F,A) and (G,B) over a common universe U is the soft set (H,C), where C = A\u222aB, and \u2200e \u2208 C,\nH(e) =\n\n\n\nF (e), if e \u2208 A\u2212B; G(e), if e \u2208 B \u2212A; F (e) \u2229G(e), if e \u2208 A \u2229B.\nWe write (F,A) \u2293 (G,B) = (H,C).\nWe are going to show (F ,P(E)) is an information algebra with the three oper-\nations d, \u2193 and \u2293 defined as above, where F is the set of all soft sets over U .\n1. Semigroup: F is associative and commutative under \u2293. The null soft set (\u2205, \u2205)\nis a neutral element such that (F,A) \u2293 (\u2205, \u2205) = (F,A) for all soft set (F,A).\n2. The axioms of labeling, marginalization, transitivity and idempotency are\nclear.\n3. Combination: For (F,A), (G,B) \u2208 F , if A \u2286 S \u2286 A \u222a B, we need to show ((F,A)\u2293 (G,B))\u2193S = (F,A)\u2293 (G,B)\u2193S\u2229B . In fact, let (F,A)\u2293 (G,B) = (H,A\u222aB) and (F,A) \u2293 (G,B)\u2193S\u2229B = (H \u2032 , S). For all e \u2208 S, we have\nH(e) = H \u2032 (e) =\n\n\n\nF (e), if e \u2208 S \u2229 (A\u2212B); G(e), if e \u2208 S \u2229 (B \u2212 A); F (e) \u2229G(e), if e \u2208 A \u2229B.\nThen ((F,A) \u2293 (G,B))\u2193S = (F,A) \u2293 (G,B)\u2193S\u2229B .\nHence (F ,P(E)) is a labeled information algebra.\nNow we look at the notion of domain-free information algebra. A system (\u03a8, D)\nwith two operations defined,\n1. Combination: \u03a8\u00d7\u03a8 \u2192 \u03a8; (\u03c6, \u03c8) 7\u2192 \u03c6\u2297 \u03c8, 2. Marginalization: \u03a8\u00d7D \u2192 \u03a8; (\u03c8, x) 7\u2192 \u03c8\u21d2x, We impose the following axioms on \u03a8 and D, and it is called a domain-free\ninformation algebra:\n1. Semigroup: \u03a8 is associative and commutative under combination, and there\nis an element e such that for all \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a8 with e\u2297 \u03c8 = \u03c8 \u2297 e = \u03c8.\n2. Transitivity: For \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6 and x, y \u2208 D, (\u03c8\u21d2y)\u21d2x = \u03c8\u2193x\u2227y. 3. Combination: For \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a8, x \u2208 D, (\u03c6\u21d2x \u2297 \u03c8)\u21d2x = \u03c6\u21d2x \u2297 \u03c8\u21d2x. 4. Support: For \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a8, there is an x \u2208 D such that \u03c8\u21d2x = \u03c8. 5. Idempotency: For \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a8 and x \u2208 D,\u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8\u21d2x = \u03c8. For simplicity, information algebra is used as a general name for labeled information algebras and domain-free information algebras. While, we can judge that whether an information algebra is \u201clabeled\u201d or not from the context.\nAn abstract example of domain-free information algebra is given below.\nExample 3. Let \u03a6 = [0, 1], D = {0, 1}. We define the following operations:\nCombination: \u2200\u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6, \u03c6\u2297 \u03c8 = max{\u03c6, \u03c8};\nFocusing: \u2200\u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, (i)\u03c6\u21d21 = \u03c6.\n(ii) \u03c6\u21d20 =\n{\n\u03c6, if \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 12 ]; 1 2 , if \u03c6 \u2208 [ 1 2 , 1].\nWe have \u03c6\u226a \u03c8 if, and only if, \u03c6 < \u03c8 or \u03c6 = \u03c8 = 0.\nIt\u2019s clear that the element 0 is a neutral element and the axioms of transitivity and support are correct. Since \u03c6\u21d2x \u2264 \u03c6 for all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, x \u2208 D, we have \u03c6\u2297\u03c6\u21d2x = \u03c6, thus the axiom of idempotency holds.\nNow, in order to prove that (\u03a6, D) is an information algebra, it suffices to check\nthe axiom of combination, that is, for \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6 and x \u2208 D,\n(\u03c6\u21d2x \u2297 \u03c8)\u21d2x = \u03c6\u21d2x \u2297 \u03c8\u21d2x.\nBy the definition of focusing, it only need to show the case of x = 0. (i) If \u03c6 \u2208 [ 12 , 1], then (\u03c6 \u21d20 \u2297 \u03c8)\u21d20 = 12 = \u03c6 \u21d20 \u2297 \u03c8\u21d20. (ii) If \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 12 ], \u03c8 \u2208 [0, 1 2 ], then (\u03c6 \u21d20 \u2297 \u03c8)\u21d20 = \u03c6\u2297 \u03c8 = \u03c6\u21d20 \u2297 \u03c8\u21d20. (iii) If \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 12 ], \u03c8 \u2208 [ 1 2 , 1], then (\u03c6 \u21d20 \u2297 \u03c8)\u21d20 = 12 = \u03c6 \u21d20 \u2297 \u03c8\u21d20.\nIn summary, we have (\u03c6\u21d2x\u2297\u03c8)\u21d2x = \u03c6\u21d2x\u2297\u03c8\u21d2x. Then (\u03a6, D) is a domain-free\ninformation algebra.\nIf (\u03a6, D) is an information algebra, we write \u03c8 \u2264 \u03c6, means an information \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 is more informative than another information \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6, i.e., \u03c8 \u2297 \u03c6 = \u03c6. The order relation \u2264 is a partial order on an information algebra (\u03a6, D). In this paper, the order relation \u2264 induced by the operation of combination is a default order on an information algebra.\nIn Ref. 2, Kohlas gave a specific method to realize the transform between domain-free information algebra and labeled information algebra as follows. In a labeled information algebra (\u03a6, D), we define for \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 and y \u2265 d(\u03c6),\n\u03c6\u2191y = \u03c6\u2297 ey.\n\u03c6\u2191y is called the vacuous extension of \u03c6 to the domain y. Now we consider a congruence relation \u03c3:\n\u03c6 \u2261 \u03c8(mod \u03c3) if, and only if \u03c6\u2191x\u2228y = \u03c8\u2191x\u2228y,\nwhere x = d(\u03c6), y = d(\u03c8). In the (\u03a6/\u03c3,D), the two operations, combination and focusing, are defined as follows:\nCombination: [\u03c6]\u03c3 \u2297 [\u03c8]\u03c3 = [\u03c6\u2297 \u03c8]\u03c3;\nFocusing: [\u03c6]\u21d2x\u03c3 = [(\u03c6 \u2191x\u2228d(\u03c6))\u2193x]\u03c3.\nThen (\u03a6/\u03c3,D) is a domain-free information algebra, and we say (\u03a6/\u03c3,D) is the associated domain-free information algebra with (\u03a6, D).\nConversely, if (\u03a6, D) is a domain-free information algebra, let\n\u03a8 = {(\u03c6, x) : \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, \u03c6 = \u03c6\u21d2x}.\nThe three operations are defined on \u03a8 as follows:\n1. Labeling: For (\u03c6, x) \u2208 \u03a8 define d(\u03c6, x) = x; 2. Combination: For (\u03c6, x), (\u03c8, y) \u2208 \u03a8 define (\u03c6, x)\u2297 (\u03c8, y) = (\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8, x \u2228 y); 3. Marginalization: For (\u03c6, x) \u2208 \u03a8 and y \u2264 x define (\u03c6, x)\u2193y = (\u03c6\u21d2y , y).\nThen (\u03a8, D) is a labeled information algebra, and is called the associated labeled information algebra with (\u03a6, D).\nAt the end of this section, we give some basic notions in lattice theory. Let (L,\u2264) be a partially ordered set. A is called a directed subset of L, if for all a, b \u2208 A, there is a c \u2208 A such that a, b \u2264 c. We write \u2228A for the least upper bound of A in L if it exists. L is called a sup-semilattice, if a \u2228 b exists for all a, b \u2208 L. If every\nsubset A \u2286 L has a greatest lower bound or a least upper bound in L, we say L is a complete lattice.\nLemma 1. 12 Let L be a sup-semilattice with bottom element 0. Then L is a complete lattice if, only if every directed subset A \u2286 L has the least upper bound \u2228A.\nDefinition 1. 12 Let L be a partially ordered set. For a, b \u2208 L we write a\u226a b, and say a way-below b if, for any directed set X \u2286 L, from b \u2264 \u2228X it follows that there is a c \u2208 X such that a \u2264 c. We call a \u2208 L a finite (compact) element, if a\u226a a.\nDefinition 2. 13 For a complete lattice L, if for all a \u2208 L, a = \u2228{b : b \u226a a}, we call L a continuous lattice. Moreover, if for all a \u2208 L, a = \u2228{b : b\u226a b \u2264 a}, we call L an algebraic lattice."}, {"heading": "3. Domain-free Continuous Information Algebras", "text": "In this part we will give the concept of domain-free continuous information algebra, and discuss the properties of continuous function spaces of domain-free continuous information algebras. Information algebras mentioned in this section are all domainfree information algebras.\n3.1. Definitions\nFirstly, we give the following lemma which contains some simple and important results about the partially ordered relation induced by the operation combination in information algebras.\nLemma 2. 2 If (\u03a6, D) is an information algebra, then\n1. \u03c6\u21d2x \u2264 \u03c6. 2. \u03c6\u2297 \u03c8 = sup{\u03c6, \u03c8}. 3. \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c8 implies \u03c6\u21d2x \u2264 \u03c8\u21d2x. 4. x \u2264 y implies \u03c6\u21d2x \u2264 \u03c6\u21d2y .\nIn general, only \u201cfinite\u201d information can be treated in computers. Therefore, for example in domain theory, a structure that each information can be approximated by these \u201cfinite\u201d information has been proposed. The concept of compact information algebra introduced by Kohlas 2 stems from the idea above. Of course, the idea of approximation also prompt us to consider a type of information algebra that each element \u03c6 in this system could be approximated with pieces of information which is \u201crelatively finite\u201d or \u201cway-below\u201d\u03c6. Then the notion of continuous information algebra is proposed next.\nDefinition 3. A system (\u03a6,\u0393, D), where (\u03a6, D) is a domain-free information algebra, the latticeD has a top element, \u0393 \u2286 \u03a6 is closed under combination and contains\nthe empty information e, satisfying the following axioms of convergence and density (resp. strong density), is called a domain-free continuous (resp. s-continuous) information algebra. \u0393 is called a basis for the system (\u03a6, D).\n1. Convergency: If X \u2286 \u0393 is a directed set, then the supremum \u2228X exists. 2. Density(D1): For all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, \u03c6 = \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393 : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6}. 3. Strong density(SD1): For all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 and x \u2208 D,\n\u03c6\u21d2x = \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393 : \u03c8 = \u03c8\u21d2x \u226a \u03c6}.\nMoreover, if a domain-free continuous (resp. s-continuous) information algebra (\u03a6,\u0393, D) satisfies the axiom of compactness, then we call (\u03a6,\u0393, D) a domain-free compact (resp. s-compact) information algebra.\n4. Compactness: If X \u2286 \u0393 is a directed set, and \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393 such that \u03c6 \u2264 \u2228X then\nthere exists a \u03c8 \u2208 X such that \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c8.\nSometime, for simplicity of expression, we directly say an information algebra is continuous or it has continuity if it is a continuous information algebra. For the other concepts in the definition, there exist some similar forms of address.\nLemma 3. 3 Let (\u03a6,\u0393, D) be a compact information algebra, then the following holds:\n1. \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393 if, and only if \u03c8 \u226a \u03c8. 2. If \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393, then \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6 if, and only if \u03c8 \u2264 \u03c6.\nFor an information algebra (\u03a6, D), we denote the set of all the finite elements of \u03a6 by \u03a6f , i.e., \u03a6f = {\u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 : \u03c6\u226a \u03c6}. If (\u03a6,\u0393, D) is a compact information algebra, by Lemma 3, we have \u0393 = \u03a6f . Therefore, we always denote a (domain-free) compact information algebra by (\u03a6,\u03a6f , D). In addition, by Lemma 3 and the definition of way-below relation, we also can naturally get that, an s-continuous(resp. continuous) information algebra (\u03a6, D) is s-compact(resp. compact) if, and only if, the set \u03a6f is a basis for the s-continuous(resp. continuous) information algebra (\u03a6, D).\nA simple example of s-continuous information algebra but not s-compact infor-\nmation algebra is presented as follows.\nExample 4. Let an information algebra (\u03a6, D) with the operations combination and focusing be defined as in Example 3.\nWe are going to show that the equation \u03c6\u21d2x = \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6 : \u03c8 = \u03c8\u21d2x \u226a \u03c6} is true for all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 and x \u2208 D. In fact, for the case of x = 0, if \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 12 ], then \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 [0, 12 ] : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6} = \u03c6 = \u03c6 \u21d20; otherwise, if \u03c6 \u2208 [ 12 , 1], then \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 [0, 1 2 ] : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6} = 12 = \u03c6 \u21d20. Thus \u03c6\u21d20 = \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 [0, 12 ] : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6} = \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6 : \u03c8 = \u03c8 \u21d20 \u226a \u03c6} for all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6. For the case of x = 1, the equation is clearly true. Hence (\u03a6, D) is s-continuous and \u03a6 is a basis. But it is not s-compact, because \u03a6f = {0}.\nProposition 1. If (\u03a6,\u0393, D) is an s-continuous information algebra, then {\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393 : \u03c8\u21d2x = \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6} is directed for all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 and x \u2208 D.\nSimilarly, if (\u03a6,\u0393, D) is a continuous information algebra, then {\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393 : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6}\nis directed for all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6.\nProof. We only prove the case of an s-continuous information algebras.\nLet \u03c81, \u03c82 \u2208 {\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393 : \u03c8\u21d2x = \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6}. Since \u0393 is closed under combination, we have \u03b7 \u2208 \u0393 if \u03b7 = \u03c81 \u2297 \u03c82. By the monotonicity of the operation focusing, we have \u03c8i = \u03c8 \u21d2x i \u2264 \u03b7 \u21d2x(i = 1, 2). So \u03b7 \u2264 \u03c8\u21d2x \u2264 \u03b7, that is, \u03b7 = \u03b7\u21d2x. Next we show that \u03b7 \u226a \u03c6. If X \u2286 \u03a6 is directed and \u03c6 \u2264 \u2228X , by \u03c81, \u03c82 \u226a \u03c6, there exist \u03c61, \u03c62 \u2208 X such that \u03c81 \u2264 \u03c61 and \u03c82 \u2264 \u03c62. Since X is directed, there is a \u03c63 \u2208 X such that \u03c61, \u03c62 \u2264 \u03c63. Then \u03c81, \u03c82 \u2264 \u03c63. We obtain that \u03b7 \u2264 \u03c63 and thus \u03b7 \u226a \u03c6. By what we have proved, we have \u03b7 \u2208 {\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393 : \u03c8 = \u03c8\u21d2x \u226a \u03c6}. Hence {\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393 : \u03c8 = \u03c8\u21d2x \u226a \u03c6} is a directed set.\nProposition 2. Let (\u03a6, D) be an information algebra. The lattice D has a top element. Then (\u03a6, D) is continuous (resp. s-continuous) if, and only if there exists a set \u03a5 \u2286 \u03a6 such that \u03a5 contains the empty information e and satisfies the two conditions of convergency and density(D2) (resp. strong density(SD2)):\n1. Convergency: If X \u2286 \u03a5 is a directed set, then the supremum \u2228X exists. 2. Density(D2): For all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, {\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a5 : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6} is directed and\n\u03c6 = \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a5 : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6}.\n3. Strong density(SD2): For all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 and x \u2208 D, {\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a5 : \u03c8 = \u03c8\u21d2x \u226a \u03c6} is\ndirected and\n\u03c6\u21d2x = \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a5 : \u03c8 = \u03c8\u21d2x \u226a \u03c6}.\nProof. By Proposition 1, the necessary condition is clear.\nConversely, assume that \u03a5 is a set which satisfies the assumptions. We need to\nfind a basis \u0393 for (\u03a6, D).\nWe show that (\u03a6,\u2264) is a complete lattice if \u03a5 satisfies the two conditions of convergency and density(D2). Firstly, {\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a5 : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6, \u03c6 \u2208 X} is also directed if X \u2286 \u03a6 is directed. Assume that \u03c81, \u03c82 \u2208 {\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a5 : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6, \u03c6 \u2208 X}, then there exist \u03c61, \u03c62 \u2208 X such that \u03c81 \u226a \u03c61, \u03c82 \u226a \u03c62. So there is a \u03c6 \u2208 X such that \u03c81, \u03c82 \u226a \u03c6 because X is directed. Since \u03c6 = \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a5 : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6}, by the definition of way-below relation and the directness of set {\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a5 : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6}, there exists a \u03b7 \u2208 \u03a5 such that \u03c81, \u03c82 \u2264 \u03b7 \u226a \u03c6. This proves that {\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a5 : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6, \u03c6 \u2208 X} is also directed. By the axiom of convergency, \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a5 : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6, \u03c6 \u2208 X} exists. Obviously, \u2228X = \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a5 : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6, \u03c6 \u2208 X}. By Lemma 2(2), (\u03a6, D) is a sup-semilattice. Since empty information e \u2208 \u03a6 is the bottom element, we obtain that (\u03a6,\u2264) is a complete lattice by Lemma 1.\nClearly the condition of strong density(SD2) is stronger than density(D2), then (\u03a6,\u2264) is also a complete lattice if \u03a5 satisfies the convergency and strong density(SD2).\nNow we claim that \u0393 = \u03a6 which is closed under combination is a basis for the system. Firstly, since (\u03a6,\u2264) is a complete lattice, the condition of convergency of \u0393 holds, and \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393 : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6}, \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393 : \u03c8 = \u03c8\u21d2x \u226a \u03c6} exist.\nIf the axiom of density(D2) holds, then \u03c6 = \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a5 : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6} \u2264 \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393 : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6} \u2264 \u03c6. We conclude that \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393 : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6} = \u03c6. Hence \u0393 is a basis for the continuous information algebra (\u03a6, D).\nSimilarly, if the axiom of strong density(SD2) holds, then \u03c6\u21d2x = \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a5 : \u03c8 = \u03c8\u21d2x \u226a \u03c6} \u2264 \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393 : \u03c8 = \u03c8\u21d2x \u226a \u03c6} \u2264 \u03c6\u21d2x. We obtain that \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393 : \u03c8 = \u03c8\u21d2x \u226a \u03c6} = \u03c6\u21d2x. Hence \u0393 is a basis for the s-continuous information algebra (\u03a6, D).\nBy Proposition 2, we give an equivalent definition of continuous information algebra. And we know that the subset of a basis \u0393 consisting of all the elements which approximate to an element \u03c6 in a continuous information algebra is directed. It is convenient for discussing the problem about continuous functions which is defined in the next subsection. But, it is worth noting that the set \u03a5 in the Proposition 2, satisfying the convergency and density(D2), is not necessarily closed under combination, although we can find out a basis \u0393 which is closed under combination for the system. An simple example rooted in lattice theory is shown as follows.\nExample 5. Let X be an infinite set, \u03a6 = P(X) and D = {1}. We define the operations combination and focusing as follows:\nCombination: A\u2297B = A \u222aB, \u2200A,B \u2208 \u03a6;\nFocusing: A\u21d21 = A, \u2200A \u2208 \u03a6.\nThe system (\u03a6, D) is an information algebra. Let \u0393 be the set of all the finite subsets of X . It is clear that C \u226a C if C \u2208 \u0393. For each set A \u2286 X , it can be represented by the combination of the directed family of all finite subsets of A, i.e., A = \u2228{B \u2208 \u0393 : B \u226a A} and {B \u2208 \u0393 : B \u226a A} is directed. Suppose that Y \u2282 X is an infinite proper subset. We write \u0393\u2217 = \u0393 \u222a {Y }. Obviously, for all A \u2208 \u03a6, A = \u2228{B \u2208 \u0393\u2217 : B \u226a A} and {B \u2208 \u0393\u2217 : B \u226a A} is still directed. While \u0393\u2217 is not closed under combination. For example, we have {x}, Y \u2208 \u0393\u2217 where x \u2208 X\u2212Y , but {x} \u2297 Y 6\u2208 \u0393\u2217.\nAccording to the proof in Proposition 2, the following theorem can be drawn immediately. It gives a compact expression for these notions defined in Definition 3.\nTheorem 1. Let (\u03a6, D) be an information algebra.\n1. (\u03a6, D) is continuous (resp. compact) if, and only if (\u03a6,\u2264) is a continuous\nlattice(resp. algebraic lattice).\n2. (\u03a6, D) is s-continuous (resp. s-compact) if, and only if (\u03a6,\u2264) is a complete\nlattice and for all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, x \u2208 D,\n\u03c6\u21d2x = \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6 : \u03c8 = \u03c8\u21d2x \u226a \u03c6}.\n(resp. \u03c6\u21d2x = \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6f : \u03c8 = \u03c8 \u21d2x \u2264 \u03c6}.)\nProof. Here we take the proof of the equivalent definition of s-compact information algebra as instance. If (\u03a6, D) is s-compact, then (\u03a6,\u2264) is a complete lattice which can be concluded from the proof of Proposition 2.\nConversely, \u03a6f satisfies the axiom of convergency if (\u03a6,\u2264) is a complete lattice. The compactness of \u03a6f is directly obtained from the definition of way-below relation and the condition of \u03c6 \u226a \u03c6 if \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6f . If \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6f , we claim that \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6f . In fact, if X \u2286 \u03a6 is a directed subset and \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8 \u2264 \u2228X , by \u03c6 \u226a \u03c6 and \u03c8 \u226a \u03c8, there exists a \u03b7 \u2208 X such that \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2264 \u03b7. So \u03c6\u2297 \u03c8 \u2264 \u03b7. Hence \u03c6\u2297 \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6\u2297 \u03c8, i.e., \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6f . We obtain that \u03a6f is a basis for the s-compact information algebra (\u03a6, D).\n3.2. Continuous Functions\nIn Ref. 2, the notion of continuous function between two s-compact information algebras has been introduced. In this subsection, the definition of continuous functions is extended to be a more general situation. We focus on the problem that whether a function space which is the set consisting of all continuous functions between two continuous information algebras can still form a continuous information algebra. In fact, the discussions about function spaces have appeared in various areas of mathematics and computer science. For example, in category theory, if the problem here is true, it is benefit to create a Cartesian closed category.\nDefinition 4. A mapping f : \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8 from a continuous information algebra (\u03a6, D) into another continuous information algebra (\u03a8, E) is called continuous, if for every directed subset X \u2286 \u03a6, f(\u2228X) = \u2228f(X).\nThe form of the definition is consistent with the definition of Scott continuous functions in domain theory. A function f between two complete lattices S, T is called Scott continuous,13 if it preserves the supremum of all directed sets, i.e., f(\u2228X) = \u2228f(X) for all directed subset X \u2286 S. Let [\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c denote the set of all continuous mappings from (\u03a6, D) into (\u03a8, E). We define the two operations of combination and focusing on the system ([\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c, D \u00d7 E) as follows 2:\n1. Combination: for f, g \u2208 [\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c define f \u2297 g by\n(f \u2297 g)(\u03c6) = f(\u03c6)\u2297 g(\u03c6).\n2. Focusing: for f \u2208 [\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c, (x, y) \u2208 D \u00d7 E define f\u21d2(x,y) by\nf\u21d2(x,y)(\u03c6) = (f(\u03c6\u21d2x))\u21d2y .\nLemma 4. 12 If S, T are two continuous lattices, then [S \u2192 T ]c is a continuous lattice with respect to the pointwise partial order.\nTheorem 2. If (\u03a6, D) is continuous, then it is s-continuous if, and only if, for all directed subset X of \u03a6 and x \u2208 D,\n(\u2228X)\u21d2x = \u2228\n\u03c6\u2208X\n\u03c6\u21d2x.\nProof. Let (\u03a6, D) be s-continuous. For all directed subset X of \u03a6 and x \u2208 D, by Lemma 2, we have (\u2228X)\u21d2x \u2265 \u2228\n\u03c6\u2208X\n\u03c6\u21d2x. On the other hand, by density, (\u2228X)\u21d2x =\n\u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393 : \u03c8 = \u03c8\u21d2x \u226a \u2228X}, where \u0393 is a basis for (\u03a6, D). If \u03c8 \u226a \u2228X , then there exists a \u03c6 \u2208 X such that \u03c8 \u2264 \u03c6. Then \u03c8 = \u03c8\u21d2x \u2264 \u03c6\u21d2x. Hence (\u2228X)\u21d2x \u2264 \u2228\n\u03c6\u2208X\n\u03c6\u21d2x.\nSo we get that (\u2228X)\u21d2x = \u2228 \u03c6\u2208X \u03c6\u21d2x.\nConversely, if (\u03a6, D) is continuous, then \u03c6 = \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6 : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6} and {\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6 : \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6} is directed for all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6. Thus, by assumption, we have \u03c6\u21d2x = \u2228{\u03c8\u21d2x : \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6, \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6}. Meanwhile, {\u03c8\u21d2x : \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6, \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6} \u2286 {\u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6 : \u03d5 = \u03d5\u21d2x \u226a \u03c6}, because \u03c8\u21d2x = (\u03c8\u21d2x)\u21d2x for all \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6. Then \u03c6\u21d2x \u2264 \u2228{\u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6 : \u03d5 = \u03d5\u21d2x \u226a \u03c6} \u2264 \u03c6\u21d2x by Lemma 2, that is, \u03c6\u21d2x = \u2228{\u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6 : \u03d5 = \u03d5\u21d2x \u226a \u03c6}. This shows that (\u03a6, D) is s-continuous.\nProposition 3. If (\u03a6, D) and (\u03a8, E) are all continuous, f, g \u2208 [\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c and (x, y) \u2208 D \u00d7 E, then f \u2297 g \u2208 [\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c.\nMoreover, if (\u03a6, D) and (\u03a8, E) are s-continuous, then f\u21d2(x,y) \u2208 [\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c.\nProof. Let {\u03c6i : i \u2208 I} be a directed subset of \u03a6. We have\n(f \u2297 g)( \u2228\ni\u2208I \u03c6i) = f(\n\u2228 i\u2208I \u03c6i)\u2297 g( \u2228 i\u2208I \u03c6i)\n= [ \u2228\ni\u2208I f(\u03c6i)]\u2297 [\n\u2228 i\u2208I g(\u03c6i)] = \u2228 i\u2208I [f(\u03c6i)\u2297 g(\u03c6i)]\n= \u2228\ni\u2208I\n(f \u2297 g)(\u03c6i),\nthen f \u2297 g \u2208 [\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c.\nSuppose X \u2286 \u03a6 is a directed set. Since f is order-preserving, we have {f(\u03c6\u21d2x) :\n\u03c6 \u2208 X} is also directed. By Theorem 2, we have\nf\u21d2(x,y)(\u2228X) = (f((\u2228X)\u21d2x))\u21d2y\n= (f( \u2228\n\u03c6\u2208X\n\u03c6\u21d2x))\u21d2y = ( \u2228\n\u03c6\u2208X\nf(\u03c6\u21d2x))\u21d2y\n= \u2228\n\u03c6\u2208X\n(f(\u03c6\u21d2x))\u21d2y = \u2228\n\u03c6\u2208X\nf\u21d2(x,y)(\u03c6).\nThen f\u21d2(x,y) \u2208 [\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c.\nLemma 5. If (\u03a6, D) and (\u03a8, E) are s-continuous, then ([\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c, D \u00d7 E) is continuous.\nProof. Firstly, we claim that ([\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c, D \u00d7 E) is a domain-free information algebra.\n1. Semigroup: If e2 is a neutral element of (\u03a8, E), let h : \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8 be defined as h(\u03c6) = e2, \u2200\u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6. Then h is a neutral element of [\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c. It\u2019s obvious that [\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c is associative and commutative under combination.\n2. Idempotency: For f \u2208 [\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c and (x, y) \u2208 D \u00d7 E, because f is orderpreserving, we obtain that (f(\u03c6\u21d2x))\u21d2y \u2264 f(\u03c6\u21d2x) \u2264 f(\u03c6) for all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6. Then (f \u2297 f\u21d2(x,y))(\u03c6) = f(\u03c6) \u2297 f\u21d2(x,y)(\u03c6) = f(\u03c6) \u2297 (f(\u03c6\u21d2x))\u21d2y = f(\u03c6). Hence f \u2297 f\u21d2(x,y) = f .\nThe axioms of transitivity, combination and support are easy to show. Hence\n([\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c, D \u00d7 E) is a domain-free information algebra.\nSince (\u03a6,\u2264) and (\u03a8,\u2264) are two continuous lattices, by Lemma 4, we have ([\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c,\u2264p) is also continuous, where \u2264p means the pointwise order on [\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c. For all f, g \u2208 [\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c, we have\nf \u2264p g \u21d4 \u2200\u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, f(\u03c6) \u2264 g(\u03c6)\n\u21d4 \u2200\u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, f(\u03c6)\u2297 g(\u03c6) = g(\u03c6), that is, (f \u2297 g)(\u03c6) = g(\u03c6) \u21d4 f \u2297 g = g, that is, f \u2264 g.\nThen ([\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c,\u2264) is a continuous lattice. This shows that ([\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c, D\u00d7E) is a continuous information algebra by Theorem 1.\nTheorem 3. If (\u03a6, D) and (\u03a8, E) are s-continuous, then ([\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c, D\u00d7E) is also s-continuous.\nProof. We have known that ([\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c, D\u00d7E) is a continuous information algebra by Lemma 5.\nLet {fi : i \u2208 I} \u2286 [\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c be directed. For all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, (x, y) \u2208 D \u00d7 E, we have\n( \u2228\ni\u2208I\nfi) \u21d2(x,y)(\u03c6) = [(\n\u2228\ni\u2208I\nfi)(\u03c6 \u21d2x)]\u21d2y\n= [ \u2228\ni\u2208I fi(\u03c6\n\u21d2x)]\u21d2y = \u2228\ni\u2208I [fi(\u03c6\n\u21d2x)]\u21d2y\n= \u2228 i\u2208I f \u21d2(x,y) i (\u03c6) = ( \u2228 i\u2208I f \u21d2(x,y) i )(\u03c6).\nThus ( \u2228\ni\u2208I fi)\n\u21d2(x,y) = \u2228 i\u2208I f \u21d2(x,y) i . By Theorem 2, ([\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a8]c, D \u00d7 E) is an s-\ncontinuous information algebra."}, {"heading": "4. Labeled Continuous Information Algebra", "text": "In this section, we will consider a type of continuous information algebras with the operation of labeling, and study the relationship between labeled continuous information algebras and domain-free continuous information algebras.\nIn Ref. 3, a notion of labeled compact information algebra has been presented. It also has given a counterexample to claim that labeled compact information algebra does not necessarily lead to domain-free compact information algebra. We will present an improved definition of labeled compact information algebra such that the associated domain-free information algebras with labeled compact information algebras are compact.\nWe firstly introduce these definitions about continuity and compactness in labeled information algebras. The difference of continuity between labeled information\nalgebras and domain-free information algebras is that, in a labeled continuous information algebra, every element \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6x can be approximated by some elements with domain x which are way-below \u03c6. Therefore, labeled continuous information algebras are a kind of information algebras which have continuity in local domain.\nDefinition 5. A system (\u03a6, {\u0393x}x\u2208D, D), where (\u03a6, D) is a labeled information algebra and the lattice D has a top element \u22a4, is called a labeled continuous (resp. s-continuous) information algebra, if, for all x \u2208 D, \u0393x \u2286 \u03a6x is closed under the combination, contains a neutral element ex and satisfies the following axioms of convergency and density (resp. strong density):\n1. Convergency: If X \u2286 \u0393x is a directed set, then the supremum \u2228X exists and\n\u2228X \u2208 \u03a6x.\n2. Density: For all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6x, \u03c6 = \u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393x : \u03c8 \u226ax \u03c6}, where \u03c8 \u226ax \u03c6 means\n\u03c8 \u226a \u03c6 in \u03a6x.\n3. Strong density: For all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6x, \u03c6 = \u2228{\u03c8 \u2193x \u2208 \u0393x : \u03c8 \u2193x \u2297 e\u22a4 \u2208 \u0393\u22a4, \u03c8 \u2193x\u226ax\u03c6}. Moreover, if a labeled continuous (resp. s-continuous) information algebra (\u03a6, {\u0393x}x\u2208D, D) satisfies the axiom of compactness, we call it a labeled compact (resp. s-compact) information algebra.\n4. Compactness: If X \u2286 \u0393x is a directed set, and \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393x such that \u03c6 \u2264 \u2228X then\nthere exists a \u03c8 \u2208 X such that \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c8.\nRemark 1. It is clear that the condition of strong density is stronger than the condition of density. Then s-continuous information algebras must be continuous. By using the same method as in the proof of Proposition 2, we can also get that (\u03a6x,\u2264) is a complete lattice for all x \u2208 D, if (\u03a6, D) is continuous.\nLemma 6. Let (\u03a6, {\u0393x}x\u2208D, D) be a labeled compact information algebra. The following holds:\n1.\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393x if, and only if \u03c8 \u226ax \u03c8.(see Ref. 3) 2. If \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393x and \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6x, then \u03c8 \u226ax \u03c6 if, and only if \u03c8 \u2264 \u03c6.\nThe above lemma follows easily from the definitions. By Lemma 6, we can denote a labeled compact information algebra by (\u03a6, {\u03a6f,x}x\u2208D, D) or (\u03a6,\u03a6f,x, D), where \u03a6f,x = {\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6x : \u03c8 \u226ax \u03c8}.\nLet us see an example of a labeled compact information algebra.\nExample 6. In Example 2, we consider a labeled information algebra (F ,P(E)). Here, for a soft set (F,A), we assume that set A \u2286 E is finite. This assumption is consistent with the application in real-life. The partial order \u2264 induced by the operation \u2293 is defined as: (F,A) \u2264 (G,B) if\n(i) A \u2286 B, and (ii) \u2200e \u2208 A, G(e) is a subset of F (e). Firstly, (FA,\u2264) is a complete lattice. In fact, for a set {(Fi, A) : i \u2208 I} \u2286 FA,\nwe have \u2228{(Fi, A) : i \u2208 I} = (F,A), where (F,A) is defined as F (e) = \u22c2\ni\u2208I Fi(e) for\nall e \u2208 A.\nSecondly, we demonstrate that (F,A) \u226aA (F,A), i.e.,(F,A) \u2208 Ff,A if, and only\nif, \u2200e \u2208 A, U \u2212 F (e) is a finite subset of U .\n(1) Let {(Gi, A) : i \u2208 I} be a directed set and (F,A) \u2264 \u2228\ni\u2208I (Gi, A). We write \u2228\ni\u2208I (Gi, A) = (G,A). \u2200e \u2208 A, we haveG(e) =\n\u22c2 i\u2208I Gi(e) \u2286 F (e). Then U\u2212F (e) \u2286 U\u2212\nG(e) = \u22c3\ni\u2208I (U\u2212Gi(e)). Since U\u2212F (e) is a finite set and {(Gi, A) : i \u2208 I} is directed,\nthere exists a i(e) \u2208 I such that U\u2212F (e) \u2286 U\u2212Gi(e)(e). Then Gi(e)(e) \u2286 F (e). Since A is a finite set and {(Gi, A) : i \u2208 I} is directed again, there exists a j \u2208 I such that Gj(e) \u2286 F (e) for all e \u2208 A, that is, (F,A) \u2264 (Gj , A). This proves (F,A) \u226aA (F,A).\n(2) For all e \u2208 A, U \u2212 F (e) can be represented as the supremum of {Bi : i \u2208 I}\nwhich is a directed family of all the finite subsets of U\u2212F (e), i.e., U\u2212F (e) = \u22c3\ni\u2208I\nBi.\nWe define a family of soft sets (Hi, A) as follows:\nHi(\u03b5) =\n{\nU \u2212Bi, if \u03b5 = e; F (e), otherwise.\nWith respect to the order relation \u2264, we have {(Hi, A) : i \u2208 I} is a directed subsets of FA and (F,A) = \u2228\ni\u2208I (Hi, A). Since (F,A) \u226aA (F,A), there exists a k \u2208 I such\nthat (F,A) \u2264 (Hk, A). Hence U \u2212 F (e) \u2286 U \u2212 Hk(e) = Bk. Thus U \u2212 F (e) is a finite subset of U . This proves what we have stated.\nAt last, we need to show the following equation holds for all A \u2286 E,\n(F,A) = \u2228{(G,A) \u2208 Ff,A : (G,A) \u2264 (F,A)}.\nFor all e \u2208 A, U \u2212 F (e) can be represented as the supremum of {Bi : i \u2208 I(e)} which is a directed family of all the finite subsets of U \u2212 F (e), i.e., U \u2212 F (e) = \u22c3 i\u2208I(e) Bi. We define a family of soft sets (Fi, A) as follows:\nFi(\u03b5) =\n{\nU \u2212Bi, if \u03b5 = e; U, otherwise.\nTherefore, according to the above observation, we have {(Fi, A) : i \u2208 I(e), e \u2208 A} \u2286 Ff,A. We write \u2228\ni\u2208I(e),e\u2208A\n(Fi, A) = (H,A). For all d \u2208 A, H(d) = \u22c2\ni\u2208I(e),e\u2208A\nFi(d) =\n\u22c2\ni\u2208I(d) Fi(d) =\n\u22c2\ni\u2208I(d) (U\u2212Bi) = F (d). Therefore (F,A) = (H,A) =\n\u2228\ni\u2208I(e),e\u2208A\n(Fi, A) \u2264\n\u2228{(G,A) \u2208 Ff,A : (G,A) \u2264 (F,A)} \u2264 (F,A). Hence (F,A) = \u2228{(G,A) \u2208 Ff,A : (G,A) \u2264 (F,A)}.\nNow we can say that (F ,P(E)) is a labeled compact information algebra.\nLemma 7. 3 Let (\u03a6, D) be a domain-free information algebra. (\u03a8, D) is the labeled information algebra associated with (\u03a6, D). For any set X \u2286 \u03a8x, if \u2228\n(\u03c8,x)\u2208X\n\u03c8 exists,\nthen \u2228\n(\u03c8,x)\u2208X\n(\u03c8, x) = ( \u2228\n(\u03c8,x)\u2208X\n\u03c8, x).\nLemma 8. Let (\u03a8, D) be the labeled information algebra associated with a domainfree continuous information algebra (\u03a6, D). If \u03c8 = \u03c8\u21d2x and \u03c6 = \u03c6\u21d2x, then \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6 implies (\u03c8, x) \u226ax (\u03c6, x).\nFurthermore, let (\u03a6, D) be a domain-free s-continuous information algebra, if\n\u03c8 = \u03c8\u21d2x and \u03c6 = \u03c6\u21d2x, then \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6 if, and only if (\u03c8, x) \u226ax (\u03c6, x).\nProof. Assume that (\u03a6, D) is a domain-free continuous information algebra and {(\u03d5j , x)}j\u2208J is a directed subset of \u03a8x such that (\u03c6, x) \u2264 \u2228\nj\u2208J (\u03d5j , x), by Lemma 7,\nwe have (\u03c6, x) \u2264 ( \u2228\nj\u2208J\n\u03d5j , x). Thus \u03c6 \u2264 \u2228\nj\u2208J\n\u03d5j . Since \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6, there is a j \u2208 J such\nthat \u03c8 \u2264 \u03d5j . Then (\u03c8, x) \u2264 (\u03d5j , x). We have (\u03c8, x) \u226ax (\u03c6, x).\nOn the other hand, if (\u03c8, x) \u226ax (\u03c6, x) and {\u03d5j}j\u2208J is a directed subset of \u03a6\nsuch that \u03c6 \u2264 \u2228\nj\u2208J \u03d5j , by Theorem 5, we have \u03c6 \u2264\n\u2228\nj\u2208J \u03d5\u21d2xj . Therefore, (\u03c6, x) \u2264\n( \u2228 j\u2208J \u03d5\u21d2xj , x) = \u2228 j\u2208J (\u03d5\u21d2xj , x). By the definition of way-below relation, there exists a j \u2208 J such that (\u03c8, x) \u2264 (\u03d5\u21d2xj , x). We have \u03c8 \u2264 \u03d5 \u21d2x j \u2264 \u03d5j . Hence \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6.\nTheorem 4. If (\u03a6, D) is a domain-free s-continuous information algebra, then its associated labeled information algebra is s-continuous too.\nProof. Let (\u03a8, D) with \u03a8 = {(\u03c6, x) : \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, \u03c6 = \u03c6\u21d2x} be the labeled information algebra associated with (\u03a6, D). We define \u0393x = {(\u03c6, x) : \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393, \u03c6 = \u03c6\u21d2x}, where \u0393 is the basis for (\u03a6, D).\n1. If (\u03c61, x), (\u03c62, x) \u2208 \u0393x, we have \u03c61\u2297\u03c62 \u2208 \u0393 and (\u03c61\u2297\u03c62)\u21d2x = (\u03c6\u21d2x1 \u2297\u03c62) \u21d2x = \u03c6\u21d2x1 \u2297 \u03c6 \u21d2x 2 = \u03c61 \u2297 \u03c62, then (\u03c61 \u2297 \u03c62, x) \u2208 \u0393x. It is clear that (e, x) \u2208 \u0393x and (e, x) is a neutral element.\n2. Let X \u2286 \u0393x be a directed set. Then {\u03c6 : (\u03c6, x) \u2208 X} \u2286 \u0393 is also directed, and\n\u2228{\u03c6 : (\u03c6, x) \u2208 X} exists. By Lemma 7, \u2228X = ( \u2228\n(\u03c6,x)\u2208X\n\u03c6, x) \u2208 \u03a8x.\n3. For all (\u03c6, x) \u2208 \u03a8x, by Lemma 7 and Lemma 8, we have\n\u2228{(\u03c8, z)\u2193x \u2208 \u0393x : (\u03c8, z)\u2193x \u2297 e\u22a4 \u2208 \u0393\u22a4, (\u03c8, z)\u2193x \u226ax (\u03c6, x)}\n= \u2228{(\u03c8\u21d2x, x) \u2208 \u0393x : (\u03c8\u21d2x, x)\u2297 e\u22a4 \u2208 \u0393\u22a4, (\u03c8\u21d2x, x) \u226ax (\u03c6, x)} = \u2228{(\u03c8\u21d2x, x) : \u03c8\u21d2x \u2208 \u0393, \u03c8\u21d2x \u226a \u03c6} = (\u2228{\u03c8\u21d2x \u2208 \u0393 : \u03c8\u21d2x \u226a \u03c6}, x) = (\u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393 : \u03c8\u21d2x = \u03c8 \u226a \u03c6}, x) = (\u03c6\u21d2x, x) = (\u03c6, x),\nwhere e\u22a4 = (e,\u22a4).\nAccording to the above proof, it follows that (\u03a8, D) is s-continuous.\nTheorem 5. If (\u03a6,\u03a6f , D) is a domain-free s-compact information algebra, then its associated labeled information algebra is s-compact too.\nProof. Let (\u03a8, D) be defined as in the proof of Theorem 4 and\n\u03a8f,x = {(\u03c8, x) : \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6f , \u03c8 = \u03c8 \u21d2x}.\nIn order to show (\u03a8, {\u03a8f,x}x\u2208D, D) is s-compact, by Theorem 4, it suffices to verify the axiom of compactness. Let {(\u03c8i, x) : i \u2208 I} be a directed subset of \u03a8f,x and (\u03c8, x) \u2208 \u03a8f,x such that (\u03c8, x) \u2264 \u2228\ni\u2208I (\u03c8i, x). Then \u03c8 \u2264\n\u2228 i\u2208I \u03c8i. By the\ncompactness of (\u03a6,\u03a6f , D), there exists a i \u2208 I such that \u03c8 \u2264 \u03c8i. This shows that (\u03c8, x) \u2264 (\u03c8i, x). Hence (\u03a8, {\u03a8f,x}x\u2208D, D) is s-compact.\nAt last, we study the properties of the associated domain-free information algebra with a labeled continuous information algebra or a labeled compact information algebra.\nLemma 9. 3 Let (\u03a6, D) be a labeled information algebra, where D has a top element \u22a4. For X \u2286 \u03a6, if \u2228X \u2208 \u03a6 exists, it holds then that\n[\u2228X ]\u03c3 = \u2228[X ]\u03c3,\nwhere [X ]\u03c3 = {[\u03b7]\u03c3 : \u03b7 \u2208 X}.\nTheorem 6. If (\u03a6, D) is a labeled continuous information algebra, then its associated domain-free information algebra (\u03a6/\u03c3,D) is also continuous.\nProof. 1. (\u03a6/\u03c3,\u2264) is complete: Let {[\u03b7]\u03c3 : \u03b7 \u2208 X} \u2286 \u03a6/\u03c3. Since \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6\u2191\u22a4( mod \u03c3), we can assume that X \u2286 \u03a6\u22a4. Then \u2228X exists because (\u03a6\u22a4,\u2264) is a complete lattice. By Lemma 9, we have \u2228{[\u03b7]\u03c3 : \u03b7 \u2208 X} = [\u2228X ]\u03c3 . Thus (\u03a6/\u03c3,\u2264) is a complete lattice.\n2. (\u03a6/\u03c3,\u2264) is continuous: For [\u03c6]\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a6/\u03c3, firstly, we assume that {\u03c8 : [\u03c8]\u03c3 \u226a [\u03c6]\u03c3} \u222a {\u03c6} \u2286 \u03a6\u22a4. Then, by Lemma 9 and the continuity in (\u03a6, D), we obtain that \u2228{[\u03c8]\u03c3 : [\u03c8]\u03c3 \u226a [\u03c6]\u03c3} = [\u2228{\u03c8 : [\u03c8]\u03c3 \u226a [\u03c6]\u03c3}]\u03c3 = [\u2228{\u03c8 : \u03c8 \u226a\u22a4 \u03c6}]\u03c3 = [\u03c6]\u03c3. Then, by Theorem 1, we obtain that (\u03a6/\u03c3,\u2264) is continuous.\nTheorem 7. If (\u03a6, {\u03a6f,x}x\u2208D, D) is a labeled compact information algebra, then its associated domain-free information algebra (\u03a6/\u03c3,D) is also compact.\nFurthermore, if (\u03a6, {\u03a6f,x}x\u2208D, D) is s-compact, then its associated domain-free\ninformation algebra (\u03a6/\u03c3,D) is s-compact too.\nProof. Let \u03a6f = {[\u03c6]\u03c3 : \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6f,\u22a4}. It is easy to see that [e\u22a4]\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a6f is a neutral element of (\u03a6/\u03c3,D). We need to verify the conditions of convergency, density, compactness and the closeness of combination in domain-free information algebra.\n1. \u03a6f is closed under combination: Let \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6f,\u22a4, then [\u03c6]\u03c3\u2297 [\u03c8]\u03c3 = [\u03c6\u2297\u03c8]\u03c3 \u2208\n\u03a6f , since \u03a6f,\u22a4 is closed under combination.\n2. Convergency: Let {[\u03c6i]\u03c3 : i \u2208 I} \u2286 \u03a6f be directed. Then {\u03c6i : i \u2208 I} \u2286 \u03a6f,\u22a4 is also directed. By the convergency of \u03a6f,\u22a4, \u2228\ni\u2208I \u03c6i exists. By Lemma 9, we have\n\u2228\ni\u2208I\n[\u03c6i]\u03c3 = [ \u2228\ni\u2208I\n\u03c6i]\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a6/\u03c3. Similarly, we can prove the axiom of compactness.\n3. Density: For \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, we show [\u03c6]\u03c3 = \u2228{[\u03c8]\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a6f : [\u03c8]\u03c3 \u2264 [\u03c6]\u03c3}. In fact,\n[\u03c6]\u03c3 = [\u03c6\u2297 e\u22a4]\u03c3 = [\u2228{\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6f,\u22a4 : \u03c8 \u2264 \u03c6\u2297 e\u22a4}]\u03c3 = \u2228{[\u03c8]\u03c3 : \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6f,\u22a4, \u03c8 \u2264 \u03c6\u2297 e\u22a4}\n\u2264 \u2228{[\u03c8]\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a6f : [\u03c8]\u03c3 \u2264 [\u03c6]\u03c3} \u2264 [\u03c6]\u03c3\nThus [\u03c6]\u03c3 = \u2228{[\u03c8]\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a6f : [\u03c8]\u03c3 \u2264 [\u03c6]\u03c3}, which implies that (\u03a6/\u03c3,D) is compact.\nIf (\u03a6, {\u03a6f,x}x\u2208D, D) is s-compact, by the above proof, we have that (\u03a6/\u03c3,D) is a domain-free compact information algebra. In order to show (\u03a6/\u03c3,D) is s-compact, it suffices to prove the strong density in information algebra (\u03a6/\u03c3,D). For \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, x \u2208 D, by the strong density in (\u03a6, {\u03a6f,x}x\u2208D, D), we have\n[\u03c6]\u21d2x\u03c3 = [\u03c6\u2297 e\u22a4] \u21d2x \u03c3\n= [(\u03c6 \u2297 e\u22a4)\u2193x]\u03c3 = [\u2228{\u03c8\u2193x \u2208 \u03a6f,x : \u03c8\u2193x \u2297 e\u22a4 \u2208 \u03a6f,\u22a4, \u03c8\u2193x \u2264 (\u03c6\u2297 e\u22a4)\u2193x}]\u03c3 = \u2228{[\u03c8\u2193x]\u03c3 : \u03c8\u2193x \u2208 \u03a6f,x, \u03c8\u2193x \u2297 e\u22a4 \u2208 \u03a6f,\u22a4, \u03c8\u2193x \u2264 (\u03c6\u2297 e\u22a4)\u2193x}.\nSince \u03c8\u2193x \u2297 e\u22a4 \u2208 \u03a6f,\u22a4, we have [\u03c8\u2193x]\u03c3 = [\u03c8\u2193x \u2297 e\u22a4]\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a6f . Meanwhile, if \u03c8\u2193x \u2264 (\u03c6\u2297 e\u22a4)\u2193x, we have [\u03c8\u2193x]\u03c3 \u2264 [(\u03c6\u2297 e\u22a4)\u2193x]\u03c3 = [\u03c6\u2297 e\u22a4]\u21d2x\u03c3 = [\u03c6] \u21d2x \u03c3 \u2264 [\u03c6]\u03c3. Thus\n[\u03c6]\u21d2x\u03c3 \u2264 \u2228{[\u03c8]\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a6f : [\u03c8]\u03c3 = [\u03c8] \u21d2x \u03c3 \u2264 [\u03c6]\u03c3} \u2264 [\u03c6] \u21d2x \u03c3 .\nThen [\u03c6]\u21d2x\u03c3 = \u2228{[\u03c8]\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a6f : [\u03c8]\u03c3 = [\u03c8] \u21d2x \u03c3 \u2264 [\u03c6]\u03c3}. This proves that (\u03a6/\u03c3,D) is s-compact.\nRemark 2. Let us make a summary of this section. We have proved that the associated labeled information algebra is s-continuous(resp. s-compact), if the original domain-free information algebra is s-continuous(resp. s-compact). On the other hand, from a labeled continuous(resp. compact/s-compact) algebra, the associated domain-free algebra we construct is also continuous (resp. compact/s-compact). Therefore, we can see that labeled information algebra and domain-free information algebra do correspond to each other on s-compactness. Unfortunately, at present, we can not obtain a conclusion that the associated domain-free information algebra with a labeled s-continuous information algebra is s-continuous."}, {"heading": "5.
