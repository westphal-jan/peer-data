In this work we show that certain reasoning problems on the second level of the polynomial hierarchy still maintain their full complexity when restricted to instances of fixed distance to one of the above graph classes. We show that the constraints of a constraint are not eliminated when the complexity of inference is eliminated by inference, and that they are a good part of the reason for the optimization.\n\n\n\nThe most obvious examples to illustrate this feature are, for example, the simplest example, the first post on a graph class in the A.C.I.S. in C++. The second post on a C++ application does a few simple functions to help our understanding of the constraints. In my example, a group of individuals are assigned a value of 10 for an inference that allows for easy inference on a single value in the context of a class. In addition, the first part of the function uses a value of 50 for an inference that permits only the optimization on the individual variable. This function only works when an inference has already been applied (which is the case for the first post on an example class). It only checks for that inference before that inference.\nThe same principle applies to the two above examples. First, the definition of each function uses a number of values for an inference. This number is not always the same as the first post. The second example is different from the first post. The definition of a function only applies if the inference has already been applied. As the first post explains, it only applies if the inference has already been applied.\nThe last example was a test case that had an explicit constraint on a class that cannot be called to generate the inference. We saw that the constraint could not be applied to the previous example. This allowed the inference to only work if the inference had already been applied. However, the second part of the function only applies if the inference had already been applied. For example, the constraint could not be applied to a class that cannot be called to generate the inference. This allowed the inference to only work if the inference has already been applied. However, the constraint could not be applied to a class that cannot be called to generate the inference. This allowed the inference to only work if the inference has already been applied.\nFinally, the definition", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 2 Jan 2012 14:59:11 GMT  (55kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0478v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["wolfgang dvo\\v{r}\\'ak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.0478"}, "pdf": {"name": "1201.0478.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Wolfgang Dvo\u0159\u00e1k"], "emails": ["dvorak@dbai.tuwien.ac.at"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar X\niv :1\n20 1.\n04 78\nv1 ["}, {"heading": "1 Overview", "text": "This work complements the studies in [9] on augmenting tractable fragments of abstract argumentation, but in contrast solely addresses negative results.\nThat is we consider abstracts argumentation which are close to a graph classes which allows for efficient reasoning methods, i.e. to one of the classes of acyclic [4], noeven [6], biparite [5] and symmetric [2] AFs.

An entry \u2264 k encodes that the respective reasoning problem is hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, i.e. either \u03a0P2 or \u03a3P2 hard, even when restricted to instances with distance to the specific graph class \u2264 k.1 Respective for an entry 1 the problems maintain there full hardness even for instances with distance 1. An entry \u201cfpt\u201d denotes that the problem is fixedparameter tractable (cf. [9]) w.r.t. the distance to the specific graph class, which implies that there is no constant maintaining (full) hardness. Moreover for stage semantics, the class of noeven itself bears the full complexity, which is mirrored by the distance 0 entries in the table. Finally let us mention that [9] provides NP / coNP hardness results even for distance 1 to symmetric.\nThe remaining of the paper is organised as follows:\n\u2022 Section 2 introduces the necessary background. In particular we give the definition of argumentation frameworks and the related semantics.\n\u2022 In Section 3 we present our technical results, i.e. reductions showing hardness for specific graph classes.\n1We do not claim that these distances are optimal, it might be the case that ever lower distances suffices to obtain the full hardness."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In this section we introduce (abstract) argumentation frameworks [4] and recall the definitions of the semantics we study in this paper.\nDefinition 1. An argumentation framework (AF) is a pair F = (A,R) where A is a set of arguments and R \u2286 A \u00d7 A is the attack relation. For a given AF F = (A,R) we use AF to denote the set A of its arguments and RF to denote its attack relation R. The pair (a, b) \u2208 R means that a attacks b. We sometimes use the notation a R b instead of (a, b) \u2208 R. For S \u2286 A and a \u2208 A, we also write S R a (resp. a R S) in case there exists an argument b \u2208 S, such that b R a (resp. a R b). In case no ambiguity arises, we use  instead of R.\nSemantics for argumentation frameworks are given via a function \u03c3 which assigns to each AF F = (A,R) a set \u03c3(F ) \u2286 2A of extensions. We shall consider here for \u03c3 the functions stb, adm, prf , com, grd , stg , and sem which stand for stable, admissible, preferred, complete, grounded, stage, and respectively, semistable semantics. Before giving the actual definitions for these semantics, we require a few more formal concepts.\nDefinition 2. Given an AF F = (A,R), an argument a \u2208 A is defended (in F ), by a set S \u2286 A if for each b \u2208 A, such that b  a, also S  b holds. Moreover, for a set S \u2286 A, we define the range of S, denoted as S+R , as the set S \u222a{b | S  b}. We write S \u2264+R E iff S + R \u2286 E + R .\nWe continue with the definitions of argumentation semantics.\nDefinition 3. Let F = (A,R) be an AF. A set S \u2286 A is conflict-free (in F ), if there are no a, b \u2208 S, such that (a, b) \u2208 R. For such a conflict-free set S, it holds that\n\u2022 S \u2208 stb(F ), if S+R = A;\n\u2022 S \u2208 adm(F ), if each a \u2208 S is defended by S;\n\u2022 S \u2208 prf (F ), if S \u2208 adm(F ) and there is no T \u2208 adm(F ) with T \u2283 S;\n\u2022 S \u2208 com(F ), if S \u2208 adm(F ) and for each a \u2208 A that is defended by S, a \u2208 S;\n\u2022 S \u2208 grd(F ), if S \u2208 com(F ) and there is no T \u2208 com(F ) with T \u2282 S;\n\u2022 S \u2208 stg(F ), if there is no conflict-free set T in F , such that T+R \u2283 S + R ;\n\u2022 S \u2208 sem(F ), if S \u2208 adm(F ) and there is no T \u2208 adm(F ) with T+R \u2283 S + R .\nWe recall that for each AF F , stb(F ) \u2286 sem(F ) \u2286 prf (F ) \u2286 com(F ) \u2286 adm(F ) holds, and that for each of the considered semantics \u03c3 except stable semantics, \u03c3(F ) 6= \u2205 holds. The grounded semantics always yields exactly one extension. Moreover if an AF has at least one stable extension then its stable, semi-stable, and stage extensions coincide.\nNext we briefly recall results concerning the complexity of reasoning. We assume the reader is familiar with standard complexity theory and in particular with the polynomial hierarchy (see e.g. [10]). We are interested in the the following decision problems for the semantics \u03c3 on the second level of the polynomial hierarchy:\n\u2022 Credulous Acceptance Cred\u03c3: Given AF F = (A,R) and an argument a \u2208 A. Is a contained in some S \u2208 \u03c3(F )?\n\u2022 Skeptical Acceptance Skept\u03c3: Given AF F = (A,R) and an argument a \u2208 A. Is a contained in each S \u2208 \u03c3(F )?\nWe summarize the general complexity of the mentioned reasoning problems [1, 3, 6, 7] in Table 2.\nFinally we introduce the distance to graph class which is closely related to the notation of a backdoor (see [9]).\nDefinition 4. Let G be a graph class and F = (A,R) an AF. We define distG(F ) as the minimal number k such that there exists a set S \u2286 A with |S| = k and (A\\S,R\u2229(A\\S\u00d7A\\S)) \u2208 G. If there is no such set S we define distG(F ) = \u221e.\nFollowing [9], we study the graph classes of acyclic (ACY), even cycle-free (NOEVEN), symmetric (SYM) and bipartite (BIP) graphs. In particular we consider decision problems which are not fixed-parameter tractable w.r.t. the above introduced distance to a fragment and prove that the problems are hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy even for a fixed distance to a tractable fragment."}, {"heading": "3 Technical Results", "text": "Most of the results in this section build on reductions from deciding whether a quantified Boolean formula (QBF) in a particular form is valid. More concrete we consider QBF \u22002 formulae, which are of the form \u2200Y \u2203X \u03d5 where X and Y are strings of propositional atoms and \u03d5 is a propositional formula over the atoms X \u222aY (we may assume that \u03d5 is in 3-CNF, \u03d5 is satisfiable or \u03d5 is monotone). We say that a QBF \u03a6 = \u2200Y \u2203X \u03d5 is valid if for each MY \u2286 Y there exists an MX \u2286 X such that M = MY \u222a MX is a model of \u03d5. The problem QSAT \u2200 2 , deciding whether a given QBF \u22002 formula is valid, is well-known to be \u03a0 P 2 -complete.\nReduction 1. Given a QBF \u03a6 = \u2200Y \u2203X \u03d5 with \u03d5 being a monotone CNF, C being the set of positive clauses, C\u0304 being the set of negative clauses and X = Y \u222a Z. The AF F 1\u03a6 = (A,R) is constructed as follows:\nA = {\u03d5, b, b\u0304} \u222a C \u222a C\u0304 \u222aX \u222a X\u0304\nR = {(c, \u03d5) | c \u2208 C \u222a C\u0304} \u222a {(\u03d5, b), (\u03d5, b\u0304)} \u222a\n{(x, x\u0304), (x\u0304, x) | x \u2208 X} \u222a\n{(l, c), (c, l) | literal l occurs in c \u2208 C \u222a C\u0304} \u222a\n{(b, c) | c \u2208 C} \u222a {(b\u0304, c\u0304) | c\u0304 \u2208 C\u0304} \u222a\n{(b, x\u0304) | x\u0304 \u2208 X\u0304} \u222a {(b\u0304, x) | x \u2208 X}\nFor an illustration of this reduction see Figure 1.\nLemma 1. For a monotoneQSAT 2\u2200 formula\u03a6 and the AF F 1 \u03a6 the following holds:\n1. The arguments b, b, c \u2208 C \u222a C are not contained in any admissible set of F 1\u03a6.\n2. For each set S \u2286 Y the set S \u222a Y \\ S is admissible in F 1\u03a6 and each set E ( Y \u222a Y not of this form is not a preferred extension.\n3. For any preferred extension E of F 1\u03a6, if \u03a6 6\u2208 E then E = S \u222a Y \\ S for some S \u2286 Y .\n4. For any preferred extension E of F 1\u03a6, if \u03a6 \u2208 E then E \u2229 (X \u222aY ) is a model of \u03d5.\n5. If M is a model of \u03d5 then M\u222a(X \u222a Y ) \\M)\u222a{\u03a6} is a preferred extension of F 1\u03a6.\nProof. We prove each point separately:\n1. In order to obtain a contradiction let us assume that there exists an admissible set E containing an argument c \u2208 C \u222a C. We have that c is either attacked by b or b, and as E is an admissible set it must contain an argument that defends c. However, \u03a6 is the only argument that attacks b or b, thus \u03a6 \u2208 E. But as c attacks \u03a6 this contradicts the conflict-freeness of E. Hence we conclude that no admissible set of F contains an argument from C \u222aC.\nNext let us assume that there exists an admissible set E containing b or b. Then E defends b or b, respectively, and thus contains an argument attacking \u03a6. As the only arguments attacking \u03a6 are those in the set C \u222a C this contradicts the above observation.\n2. As all attacks concerning arguments in Y \u222a Y are mutual attacks we conclude that a subset of Y \u222a Y is admissible if and only if it is conflict-free. One can see that the maximal conflict free subsets of Y \u222a Y are the sets\nS \u222a Y \\ S with S \u2286 Y . Hence we can conclude that (i) these sets are admissible, (ii) each admissible subset of Y \u222aY is either of the form S\u222aY \\ S with S \u2286 Y or the subset of such a set, and (iii) no subset of such a set can be maximal admissible, i.e., preferred.\n3. As mentioned in (1) the arguments b, b, c \u2208 C \u222a C are not contained in any admissible set. Further, since \u03a6 6\u2208 E we obtain that the arguments x \u2208 X \u222a X are not defended by E and thus not contained in E. The only arguments that are left belong to Y \u222a Y and hence by (2) E = S \u222a Y \\ S.\n4. As \u03a6 \u2208 E it follows that each argument in C \u222aC is attacked by E. Further as b, b 6\u2208 E each argument in C \u222aC is attacked by an argument in E \u2229 (X \u222a Y \u222aX \u222a Y ). Thus by construction, E \u2229 (X \u222a Y ) is a model of \u03d5.\n5. Clearly M \u222a (X \u222a Y ) \\M) \u222a {\u03a6} is conflict-free. We have mutual attacks between arguments x \u2208 X\u222aY and the corresponding arguments x \u2208 X\u222aY . Hence all arguments in X\u222aY \u222aX\u222aY are either in the set M\u222a(X \u222a Y ) \\M) or attacked by some argument from this set. Further, as M is a model of \u03a6, it follows by construction that the arguments M \u222a (X \u222a Y ) \\M attack all the arguments in C \u222a C and thus defend \u03a6. Finally the argument \u03a6 attacks both b and b. That is, each argument of F either is in the set M \u222a (X \u222a Y ) \\M) \u222a {\u03a6} or attacked by an argument from this set. Hence the set M \u222a (X \u222a Y ) \\M) \u222a {\u03a6} is a stable extension of F , and thus also an preferred extension of F .\nProposition 1. A monotone QSAT 2\u2200 formula \u03a6 is valid iff the argument \u03a6 is skeptically accepted in F 1\u03a6 with respect to prf .\nProof. We are first going to show that the formula \u03a6 is valid only if the argument \u03a6 is skeptically accepted in F with respect to prf . To this end we consider a valid formula \u03a6 = \u2200Y \u2203X\u03d5(X, Y ). In order to obtain a contradiction let us assume that there exists a preferred extension E such that \u03a6 6\u2208 E. Then we have that E = S \u222a Y \\ S for some S \u2286 Y . Using that the formula \u03a6 is valid, we conclude that there exists a model M of \u03d5 such that S ( M . But then E \u2032 = M\u222a(X \u222a Y ) \\M)\u222a{\u03a6} is a preferred extension of F and E ( E \u2032, a contradiction.\nIt remains to show that the formula \u03a6 is valid if the argument \u03a6 is skeptically accepted in F with respect to prf . To this end let us assume that \u03a6 is not valid, i.e., there exists an S ( Y which is not contained in any model of \u03d5. Now let us\nconsider an arbitrary preferred extension E such that S \u222a Y \\ S \u2286 E. Such an E must exist as S \u222a Y \\ S is an admissible set. In order to obtain a contradiction we assume that \u03a6 \u2208 E. It follows that E \u2229 (X \u222a Y ) is a model of \u03d5 containing S, a contradiction. Thus \u03a6 6\u2208 E and we conclude that E is a preferred extension that does not contain \u03a6. Hence the argument \u03a6 is not skeptically accepted in F with respect to the preferred semantics.\nTheorem 1. The problem Skeptprf is \u03a0 P 2 -complete even for AFs F with distBIP (F ) = 1.\nProof. By Proposition 1 one can use F 1\u03a6 to reduce the \u03a0 P 2 -hard problem, deciding whether a monotone QSAT 2\u2200 formula is valid to Skeptprf . Now mention that deleting the argument \u03d5 from the AF F 1\u03a6 would result a bipartite AF.\nReduction 2. Given a QBF \u03a6 = \u2200Y \u2203X \u03d5 with \u03d5 being a CNF, C being the set of clauses and X = Y \u222a Z. The AF F 2\u03a6 = (A,R) is constructed as follows:\nA = {\u03d5, b} \u222a C \u222a C\u0304 \u222aX \u222a X\u0304\nR = {(c, \u03d5) | c \u2208 C} \u222a {(\u03d5, b)} \u222a\n{(x, x\u0304), (x\u0304, x) | x \u2208 X} \u222a\n{(l, c), (c, l) | literal l occurs in c \u2208 C} \u222a\n{(b, c) | c \u2208 C \u222a C\u0304} \u222a {(b, x) | x \u2208 X \u222a X\u0304}\nTheorem 2. The problem Skeptprf is \u03a0 P 2 -complete even for AFs F with distSYM(F ) = 2.\nProof sketch. One can show that F 2\u03a6 (similar to Proposition 1) reduces the \u03a0 P 2 - hard problem, deciding whether a QSAT 2\u2200 formula is valid to Skeptprf . Furthermore deleting the arguments \u03d5, b from the AF F 2\u03a6 would result a symmetric AF.\nReduction 3. Given a QBF \u03a6 = \u2200Y \u2203Z \u03d5 with \u03d5 being a monotone CNF, C being the set of positive clauses, C\u0304 being the set of negative clauses and X = Y \u222a Z. The AF F 3\u03a6 = (A,R) is constructed as follows:\nA\u03a6 = {\u03d5p, \u03d5n, \u03d5\u0304, b, g} \u222a C \u222a C\u0304 \u222aX \u222a X\u0304 \u222a Y \u2032 \u222a Y\u0304 \u2032\nR\u03a6 = {\u3008c, \u03d5p\u3009 | c \u2208 C} \u222a {\u3008c\u0304, \u03d5p\u3009 | c\u0304 \u2208 C\u0304} \u222a {\u3008x, x\u0304\u3009 , \u3008x\u0304, x\u3009 | x \u2208 X} \u222a\n{\u3008x, c\u3009 , \u3008c, x\u3009 | x occurs in c} \u222a {\u3008x\u0304, c\u3009 , \u3008c, x\u0304\u3009 | \u00acx occurs in c}\n{\u3008y, y\u2032\u3009 , \u3008y\u2032, y\u3009 , \u3008y\u0304, y\u0304\u2032\u3009 , \u3008y\u0304\u2032, y\u0304\u3009 | y \u2208 Y } \u222a {(g, y\u2032), (g, y\u0304\u2032) | y \u2208 Y } \u222a\n{\u3008\u03d5p, b\u3009 , \u3008b, \u03d5p\u3009 , \u3008g, g\u3009 , \u3008g, b\u3009} \u222a {(g, c) | c \u2208 C} \u222a {(\u03d5p, \u03d5\u0304), (\u03d5\u0304, \u03d5p)}\nFor an example, see Figure 3.\nProposition 2. For a monotone QBF \u03a6 = \u2200Y \u2203Z \u03d5 with each clause containing an literal from Z \u222a Z\u0304, the following statements are equivalent\n1. \u03a6 is valid.\n2. \u03d5p is skeptically accepted in F 3\u03a6 w.r.t. semi-stable semantics.\n3. \u03d5\u0304 is not credulously accepted in F 3\u03a6 w.r.t. semi-stable semantics.\nProof sketch. (1) \u21d4 (2): Notice that this reduction is a variation of the reduction presented in [7]. Recall that the candidates for being semi-stable extensions are the preferred extensions. We have that none of the arguments {g, b} \u222a C \u222a C\u0304 \u222a Y \u2032\u222aY\u0304 \u2032 is acceptable for a semi-stable extension, as none of them can be defended. Moreover each E,E1, E2 \u2208 prf (F 3\u03a6) satisfies:\n\u2022 y \u2208 Y \u21d2 |{y, y\u0304} \u2229 E| = 1\n\u2022 z \u2208 Z \u21d2 |{z, z\u0304} \u2229 E| = 1\n\u2022 For y \u2208 Y if y \u2208 E1 and y\u0304 \u2208 E2 then E1 6\u2264+ E2 and E2 6\u2264+ E1.\nSo each preferred extension corresponds to an true-assignment on Y \u222a Z, and each true-assignment to at least on preferred extension. Further we have that assignments that differ on Y , result preferred extensions with incomparable range.\n\u21d2: Let us assume that \u03a6 = \u2200Y \u2203Z \u03d5 is valid and let us consider an E \u2208 sem(F 3\u03a6). E give rise to an true-assignment MY = E \u2229 Y on variables Y , by assumption we have that there exists MZ \u2286 Z such that MY \u222aMZ is a model of \u03d5. Then the set G = MY \u222aY \\MY \u222aMZ\u222aZ \\MZ\u222a{\u03d5p, \u03d5n} is an admissible set with G+ = A \\ ({g}\u222a (Y \\M \u2032Y )\u222a M\u0304Y \u2032 ). One can easily show that no admissible set containing MY \u222aY \\MY has any of the arguments ({g}\u222a (Y \\M \u2032Y )\u222aM\u0304Y \u2032 ) it its range and hence G is \u2264+-maximal. As by assumption also E is \u2264+-maximal we have E+ = G+ and as b \u2208 E+ we have \u03d5 \u2208 E.\n\u21d0: Let us assume that \u03a6 = \u2200Y \u2203Z \u03d5 is not valid, i.e. there is an MY \u2286 Y such that there is no MZ \u2286 Z such that MY \u222aMZ is a model of \u03d5. We consider the set E = MY \u222aY \\MY \u222aZ\u222a{\u03d5\u0304, \u03d5n} which is admissible as each clause of C\u0304 contains at least one literal from Z. We have that E+ = A \\ ({g, b} \u222a (Y \\M \u2032Y ) \u222a M\u0304Y \u2032 ). Hence we have that E is semi-stable unless there exists an extension G with G+ = A \\ ({g} \u222a (Y \\ M \u2032Y ) \u222a M\u0304Y \u2032 ). Such a G must contain both \u03d5n and \u03d5p and thus attacks each c \u2208 C \u222a C\u0304. Hence, by construction of F 3\u03a6, G would corresponds to a model MY \u222aMZ of \u03d5, a contradiction to our assumption that there is no MZ \u2286 Z. Thus E is a semi-stable extension with \u03d5 6\u2208 E.\n(2) \u21d4 (3): As \u03d5\u0304 is only in conflict with \u03d5p for each E \u2208 sem(F 3\u03a6) either \u03d5p \u2208 E or \u03d5\u0304 \u2208 E holds.\nTheorem 3. The problem Cred sem is \u03a3P2 -complete and the problem Skeptsem is \u03a0P2 -complete even for AFs F with distBIP (F ) \u2264 1.\nProof. By Proposition 2 and the observation that for monotone QBFs the F 3\u03a6\u2212{g} is bipartite.\nReduction 4. For a given QBF \u03a6 = \u2200Y \u2203Z\u03d5(Y, Z), build the AF F 4\u03a6 = (A\u03a6, R\u03a6) with\nA\u03a6 = {\u03d5, \u03d5\u0304, b, g} \u222a C \u222aX \u222a X\u0304 \u222a Y \u2032 \u222a Y\u0304 \u2032\nR\u03a6 = {\u3008c, \u03d5\u3009 | c \u2208 C} \u222a {\u3008x, x\u0304\u3009 , \u3008x\u0304, x\u3009 | x \u2208 X} \u222a\n{\u3008x, c\u3009 , \u3008c, x\u3009 | x occurs in c} \u222a {\u3008x\u0304, c\u3009 , \u3008c, x\u0304\u3009 | \u00acx occurs in c}\n{\u3008y, y\u2032\u3009 , \u3008y\u2032, y\u3009 , \u3008y\u0304, y\u0304\u2032\u3009 , \u3008y\u0304\u2032, y\u0304\u3009 | y \u2208 Y }\u222a{\u3008\u03d5, b\u3009 , \u3008b, \u03d5\u3009 , \u3008g, g\u3009 , \u3008g, b\u3009}\n\u222a{(g, y\u2032), (g, y\u0304\u2032) | y \u2208 Y } \u222a {(\u03d5, \u03d5\u0304), (\u03d5\u0304, \u03d5)}\nFor an example, see Figure 4.\nProposition 3.

Notice that this reduction is a variation of the reduction presented in [7] and can be easily shown to be equivalent, using that the arguments {g, b} \u222a Y \u2032 \u222a Y\u0304 \u2032 are not acceptable w.r.t. semi-stable semantics.\nTheorem 4. The problem Cred sem is \u03a3P2 -complete and the problem Skeptsem is \u03a0P2 -complete even for AFs F with distSYM(F ) \u2264 2\nProof. By Proposition 3 and the observation that the F 4\u03a6 \u2212 {\u03d5, g} is symmetric.\nReduction 5. Let (\u03d5, x\u03b1) be an instance for the MINSAT problem, i.e. \u03d5 is a propositional formula over atoms X in CNF and x\u03b1 \u2208 X . We assume an arbitrary order < on the clauses of \u03d5. The AF F\u03d5,x\u03b1 = (A,R) is constructed as follows:\nA = {\u03d5, b, q} \u222a C \u222aX \u222a X\u0304 \u222a {Ec | c \u2208 C}\nR = {(c, \u03d5) | c \u2208 C} \u222a {(\u03d5, b), (b, b), (q, x\u03b1)} \u222a\n{(x, x\u0304), (x\u0304, x) | x \u2208 X} \u222a\n{(l, c) | literal l occurs in c \u2208 C} \u222a\n{(Ec, a) | c \u2208 C, a \u2208 A \\ ({c, \u03d5, b} \u222a {Ec\u2032 : c \u2032 < c})}\nProposition 4. Given (\u03d5, x\u03b1) the following statements are equivalent:\n1. The atom x\u03b1 is in a minimal model of \u03d5.\n2. The argument x\u03b1 is credulously accepted in F\u03d5,x\u03b1 w.r.t. stage semantics.\n3. The argument q is not skeptically accepted in F\u03d5,x\u03b1 w.r.t. stage semantics.\nProof. (1) \u21d4 (2) Recall that each stage extension is also a naive extensions, and hence we consider only naive extensions as candidates for stage extensions.\nFirst let us consider naive extensions of F\u03d5,x\u03b1 = (A,R) containing an argument Ec. For simplicity we enumerate the clauses c1, . . . , cm and the arguments E1, . . . , Em, according to the order < on the clauses. Now one can easily check that these naive extensions are given by {{Ei, \u03d5, q}, {Ei, ci, q} | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m}. Further we have that the arguments E1, . . . , Em are in conflict with each other but not attacked from any other argument. Thus when concerning the \u2264+Rmaximality of the above naive extensions they only compete with each other but not with any other naive extension. Comparing the range of these extensions we get that stage extensions E such that for some i, Ei \u2208 E are the following {{Ei, \u03d5, q} | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n} \u222a {{E1, c1, q}}.\nNow let us consider naive sets E such that for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m, Ei 6\u2208 E. As we already have stage extensions with {Ei, ci, q}+ = A \\ {b} and {Ei, \u03d5, q}+ = A \\ ({ci, E1, . . . , Ei\u22121}) Clearly {E1, . . . , Em} \u2229 E = \u2205 and thus the only way for E being \u2264+R-maximal is that {b, c1, . . . , cm} \u2286 E\n+. When b \u2208 E+ then we have that \u03d5 \u2208 E and hence for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m ci 6\u2208 E. That is that {b, c1, . . . , cm} \u2286 E+ iff \u03d5 \u2208 E and X\u2229E is a model of \u03d5. Hence there is a one-to-one correspondence between\nmodels M of \u03d5 and candidates for stage extensionsM\u222aX \\M\u222a{\u03d5}\u222a{q | if x 6\u2208 M} By the construction the range of each this candidate is clearly incomparable with the ranges of the already determined stage extensions {{Ei, \u03d5, q} | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n}\u222a{{E1, c1, q}}. and thus the \u2264 +\nR-maximality of such a candidate only depends on the other candidates.\nIt remains to show that for two models M,N , M \u2286 N iff M \u222a X \\M \u222a {\u03d5} \u222a {q | if x 6\u2208 M} \u2265+R N \u222a X \\N \u222a {\u03d5} \u222a {q | if x 6\u2208 N} For the \u201conly if\u201d direction consider M \u2286 N . We have that (M \u222a X \\M \u222a {\u03d5} \u222a {q | if x 6\u2208 M})+ = A\\ (M\u0304 \u222a{E1, . . . , Em})\u222a{q | if x 6\u2208 M} and (N \u222aX \\N \u222a{\u03d5}\u222a{q | if x 6\u2208 N})+ = A \\ (N\u0304 \u222a {E1, . . . , Em}) \u222a {q | if x 6\u2208 M}. As by assumption M \u2286 N we finally have that A\\(M\u0304 \u222a{E1, . . . , Em}) \u2287 A\\(N\u0304 \u222a{E1, . . . , Em}). For the \u201cif\u201d part let us consider M 6\u2286 N . Hence there is some x \u2208 M such that x 6\u2208 N . But then we have that x\u0304 6\u2208 (M \u222aX \\M \u222a {\u03d5} \u222a {q | if x 6\u2208 M})+ and x\u0304 \u2208 (N \u222aX \\N \u222a{\u03d5}\u222a{q | if x 6\u2208 N})+. That is that M \u222aX \\M \u222a{\u03d5}\u222a{q | if x 6\u2208 M} 6\u2265+R N \u222aX \\N \u222a {\u03d5} \u222a {q | if x 6\u2208 N}.\n(2) \u21d4 (3): As x\u03b1 is the only argument which has a conflict with q we have that each naive extensions, and thus also each stage extension, either contains q or x\u03b1. Hence if q is in all stage extensions then x\u03b1 is not credulously accepted and vice versa.\nTheorem 5. The problem Cred stg is \u03a3P2 -complete and the problem Skeptstg is \u03a0P2 -complete even for AFs without even-cycles.\nProof. Immediate by Proposition 4, the fact that Minsat is \u03a0P2 -complete [8] and the fact that F\u03a6,x\u03b1 has no even length cycle.\nTheorem 6. The problem Cred stg is \u03a3P2 -complete and the problem Skeptstg is \u03a0P2 -complete even for AFs F with distACY (F ) = 1.\nProof. Immediate by Proposition 4, the fact that Minsat is \u03a0P2 -complete [8] and the fact that F\u03a6,x\u03b1 contains just one cycle, i.e. the self-attacking argument b.\nReduction 6. Given a QBF 2\u2200 formula \u03a6 = \u2200Y \u2203Z\u03d5, we define F 5 \u03a6 = (A,R), where\nA = {\u03d5, \u03d5\u0304, b, u, v} \u222a C \u222a Y \u222a Y\u0304 \u222a Y \u2032 \u222a Y\u0304 \u2032 \u222a Z \u222a Z\u0304\nR = {(c, \u03d5) | c \u2208 C} \u222a {(\u03d5, \u03d5\u0304), (\u03d5\u0304, \u03d5), (\u03d5, b), (b, b)} \u222a\n{(x, x\u0304), (x\u0304, x) | x \u2208 Y \u222a Z} \u222a\n{(y, y\u2032), (y\u0304, y\u0304\u2032), (y\u2032, y), (y\u0304\u2032, y\u0304) | y \u2208 Y } \u222a\n{(l, c), (c, l) | literal l occurs in c \u2208 C} \u222a\n{(u, v), (v, v)} \u222a {(y\u2032, u), (y\u0304\u2032, u) | y \u2208 Y }\nProposition 5. Given a (monotone) QBF 2\u2200 formula \u03a6 = \u2200Y \u2203Z\u03d5 the following statements are equivalent:\n1. \u03a6 is valid\n2. \u03d5 is skeptically accepted in F 5\u03a6 w.r.t. stage semantics.\n3. \u03d5\u0304 is not credulously accepted in F 5\u03a6 w.r.t. stage semantics.\nProof sketch. Mention that F 5\u03a6 is a modification of the reduction presented in [7]. (1) \u21d4 (2) The candidates for being stage extension are \u2286-maximal conflictfree sets, we notate them as naive(F 5\u03a6). We have two classes of naive extensions, those containing the argument u and those not containing u, which are incomparable w.r.t. \u2264+R which can be seen as follows. For E in first class we have v \u2208 E + and either y\u20321 6\u2208 E + or y\u0304\u20321 6\u2208 E\n+ while for E in the latter class v 6\u2208 E+ and y\u20321, y\u0304 \u2032 1 \u2208 E\n+. So let us first consider the extensions containing u then we have that all of the arguments Y \u2032 \u222a Y\u0304 are unacceptable and we end up with the same situation as in\n[7]. Using the results from [7] we have that \u03a6 is valid iff \u03d5 is skeptically accepted in the stage extensions containing u.\nNow let us consider the extensions E with u /\u2208 E. If \u03a6 is invalid the \u03d5 fails to be skeptically accepted in the first case anyway. Thus we restrict ourselves to the case where \u03a6 is valid. Then \u03d5 has at least one model M \u2286 Y \u222a Z and we can construct the extension S = M \u222a (Y \u222a Z) \\M \u222a ((Y \u222a Z) \\ M)\u2032 \u222a M\u0304 \u2032 \u222a {\u03d5}. As M is model of \u03d5 we have that S+ = A \\ {v}. As no stage extension E with u /\u2208 E satisfies v \u2208 E+, each of these extensions has E+ = S+ = A \\ {v}. By b \u2208 E+ and \u03d5 being the only attacker of b we obtain \u03d5 \u2208 E for each E. Hence \u03d5 is skeptically accepted.\n(2) \u21d4 (3) as \u03d5\u0304 is only in conflict with \u03d5 for each E \u2208 stg(F 5\u03a6) either \u03d5 \u2208 E or \u03d5\u0304 \u2208 E holds.\nTheorem 7.
