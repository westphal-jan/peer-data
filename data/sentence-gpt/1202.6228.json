The novelty of our work is the critical use of the confusion matrix of a classifier as an error measure; this puts our contribution in the line of work aiming at dealing with performance measure that are richer than mere scalar criterion such as the misclassification rate. Thanks to very recent and beautiful results on matrix concentration inequalities, we derive two bounds showing that the true confusion risk of the Gibbs classifier is upper-bounded by its empirical risk plus a term depending on the number of training examples in each class. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first PAC-Bayes bounds based on confusion matrices. The second limits on the use of the classification matrix have yet to be considered, and the new limits are likely to be adopted in a later phase of our work. As such, this work is not intended to increase the statistical power of the discriminator classifier. We may still want to explore this issue in future work.\n\n\n\nThe significance of the Gibbs classifier is also a question for the new approach of the model-based model-based problem-solving technique, as well as for the classification problem of the Gibbs classifier.

This paper discusses the relationship between the classifier and the problem-solving technique of the classification problem of the Gibbs classifier (D1.1-D2) and the Kibbe-R\u00f6dinger-Liktor (GIS). We also discuss the role of the classification problem in the distribution of the discriminator classifier (D1.0-D2) and the Kibbe-R\u00f6dinger-Liktor (GIS).\n\nThis paper was adapted for the new approach of the model-based problem-solving technique, as well as to be presented in the latest paper.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Feb 2012 14:13:01 GMT  (27kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6228v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 22 Mar 2012 09:29:28 GMT  (27kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6228v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 24 May 2012 06:26:12 GMT  (55kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6228v3", "Arxiv:this http URL, Accepted at ICML 2012"], ["v4", "Sat, 30 Jun 2012 19:23:14 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6228v4", "Arxiv:this http URL, Accepted at ICML 2012"], ["v5", "Wed, 4 Jul 2012 14:57:53 GMT  (55kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6228v5", "Arxiv:this http URL, Accepted at ICML 2012"], ["v6", "Tue, 22 Oct 2013 08:25:52 GMT  (55kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6228v6", "Arxiv:this http URL, Accepted at ICML 2012"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["emilie morvant", "sokol ko\u00e7o", "liva ralaivola"], "accepted": true, "id": "1202.6228"}, "pdf": {"name": "1202.6228.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bound on Confusion Matrix for Multi-Class Classification\u2217", "authors": ["Emilie Morvant", "Sokol Ko\u00e7o", "Liva Ralaivola"], "emails": ["firstname.name@lif.univ-mrs.fr"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords: Machine Learning, PAC-Bayes generalization bounds, Confusion Matrix, Concentration Inequality, Multi-Class Classification"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "The PAC-Bayesian framework, first introduced by McAllester (1999b), provides an important field of research in learning theory. It borrows ideas from the philosophy of Bayesian inference and mix them with techniques used in statistical approaches of learning. Given a family of classifiers F , the ingredients of a PAC-Bayesian bound are a prior distribution P over F , a learning sample S and a posterior distribution Q over F . Distribution P conveys some prior belief on what are the best classifiers from F (prior any access to S); the classifiers expected to be the most performant for the classification task at hand therefore have the largest weights under P. The posterior distribution Q is learned/adjusted using the information provided by the training set S. The essence of PAC-Bayesian results is to bound the risk of the stochastic Gibbs classifier associated with Q (Catoni, 2004) \u2014in order to predict the label of an example x, the Gibbs classifier first draws a classifier f from F according to Q and then returns f(x) as the predicted label.\nWhen specialized to appropriate function spaces F and relevant families of prior and posterior distributions, PAC-Bayes bounds can be used to characterize the error of a few existing classification methods. An example deals with the risk of methods based upon the idea of the majority vote in the case of binary classification. We may notice that if Q is the posterior distribution, the error of the Q-weighted majority vote classifier, which makes a prediction for x according to \u2211 f f(x)Q(f), is bounded by twice the error of the Gibbs classifier. If the classifiers from F on which the distribution Q puts a lot of weight are good enough, then the bound on the risk of the Gibbs classifier can be an informative bound for the risk of the Q-weighted majority vote. With a more elaborated argument, Langford and Shawe-Taylor (2002) give a PAC-Bayes bound for Support Vector Machine (SVM) which closely relates the risk of the Gibbs classifier and that of the corresponding majority vote classifier, and where the margin of the examples enter into play. In their study, both the prior and posterior distribution are normal distributions, with different means and variances. Empirical results show that this bound is a good estimator of the risk of SVMs (Langford, 2005).\n\u2217This work was supported in part by the french projects VideoSense ANR-09-CORD-026 and DECODA ANR-09-CORD005-01 of the ANR in part by the IST Programme of the European Community, under the PASCAL2 Network of Excellence, IST-2007-216886.

For example, Lacasse et al. (2007) have introduced an elegant bound on the risk of the majority vote, which holds for any space F . This bound is used to derive an algorithm, namely MinCq (Laviolette et al., 2011), which achieves empirical results on par with state-of-the-art methods. Some other important results are given in (Catoni, 2007; Seeger, 2002; McAllester, 1999a; Langford et al., 2001).\nIn this paper, we address the multiclass classification problem. Some related works are therefore multiclass formulations for the SVMs, such as the frameworks of Weston and Watkins (1998), Lee et al. (2004) and Crammer and Singer (2002). As majority vote methods, we can also cite multiclass adaptations of AdaBoost Freund and Schapire (1996), such as the framework proposed by Mukherjee and Schapire (2011), AdaBoost.MH/AdaBoost.MR algorithms of Schapire and Singer (1999) and SAMME algorithm by Zhu et al. (2009).\nThe originality of our work is that we consider the confusion matrix of the Gibbs classifier as an error measure. We believe that in the multiclass framework, it is more relevant to consider the confusion matrix as the error measure than the mere misclassification error, which corresponds to the probability for some classifier h to err on x. The information as to what is the probability for an instance of class p to be classified into class q (with p 6= q) by some predictor is indeed crucial in some applications (think of the difference between false-negative and false-positive predictions in a diagnosis automated system). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a generalization bound on the confusion matrix in the PAC-Bayesian framework. The result that we propose heavily relies on the matrix concentration inequality for sums of random matrices introduced by Tropp (2011). One may anticipate that generalization bounds for the confusion matrix may also be obtained in other framework than the PAC-Bayesian one, such as the uniform stability framework, the online learning framework and so on.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2 introduces the setting of multiclass learning and some of the basic notation used throughout the paper. Sec. 3 briefly recalls the folk PAC-Bayes bound as introduced in McAllester (2003).

The set of labels we consider is Y = {\u22121; 1} (with Q = 2) and, for each classifier f \u2208 F , the predicted output of x \u2208 X is given by sign(f(x)). The true risk R(f) and the empirical error RS(f) of f are defined as:\nR(f) def = E(x,y)\u223cDI(f(x 6= y)) ; RS(f) def =\n1\nm m\u2211 i=1 I(f(xi 6= yi)).\nThe learner\u2019s aim is to choose a posterior distribution Q on F such that the risk of the Q-weighted majority vote (also called the Bayes classifier) BQ is as small as possible. BQ is defined by:\nBQ(x) = sign [Ef\u223cQf(x)] .\nThe true risk R(BQ) and the empirical error RS(BQ) of the Bayes classifier are defined as the probability that it commits an error on an example:\nR(BQ) def = P(x,y)\u223cD (BQ(x) 6= y) . (7)\nHowever, the PAC-Bayes approach does not directly bound the risk of BQ. Instead, it bounds the risk of the stochastic Gibbs classifier GQ which predicts the label of x \u2208 X by first drawing f according to Q and then returning f(x). The true risk R(GQ) and the empirical error RS(GQ) of GQ are therefore:\nR(GQ) = Ef\u223cQR(f) ; RS(GQ) = Ef\u223cQRS(f). (8)\nNote that in this setting, if BQ misclassifies x, then at least half of the classifiers (under Q) commit an error on x. Hence, we directly have: R(BQ) \u2264 2R(GQ). Thus, an upper bound on R(GQ) gives rise to an upper bound on R(BQ).\nWe present the PAC-Bayes theorem which gives a bound on the error of the stochastic Gibbs classifier.\nTheorem 1 (i.i.d. binary classification PAC-Bayes Bound).

The output space is Y = {1, . . . , Q}, with Q > 2. We only consider learning algorithms acting on learning sample S = {(xi, yi)}mi=1 where each example is drawn i.i.d according to D, such that |S| \u2265 Q and myj \u2265 1 for every class yj \u2208 Y , where myj is the number of examples of real class yj . In the context of multiclass classification, an error measure can be the confusion matrix. Especially, we consider a confusion matrix builds upon the classical definition based on conditional probalities: It is inherent (and desirable) to \u2019hide\u2019 the effects of diversely represented classes. Concretely, for a given classifier f \u2208 F and a sample S = {(xi, yi)}mi=1 \u223c Dm, the empirical confusion matrix DfS = (d\u0302pq)1\u2264p,q\u2264Q of f is defined as follows:\n\u2200(p, q), d\u0302pq def = m\u2211 i=1 1 myi I(f(xi) = q)I(yi = p).\nThe true confusion matrix Df = (dpq)1\u2264p,q\u2264Q of f over D corresponds to:\n\u2200(p, q), dpq def = Ex|y=pI ( f(x) = q ) = P(x,y)\u223cD(f(x) = q|y = p).\nIf f correctly classifies every example of the sample S, then all the elements of the confusion matrix are 0, except for the diagonal ones which correspond to the correctly classified examples. Hence the more there are non-zero elements in a confusion matrix outside the diagonal, the more the classifier is prone to err. Recall that in a learning process the objective is to learn a classifier f \u2208 F with a low true error (i.e. with good generalization guarantees), we are thus only interested in the errors of f . Our objective is then to find f leading to a confusion matrix with the more zero elements outside the diagonal. Since the diagonal gives the conditional probabilities of \u2019correct\u2019 predictions, we propose to consider a different kind of confusion matrix by discarding the diagonal values. Then the only non-zero elements of the new confusion matrix correspond to the examples that are misclassified by f . For all f \u2208 F we define the empirical and true confusion matrices of f by respectively CfS = (c\u0302pq)1\u2264p,q\u2264Q and C\nf = (cpq)1\u2264p,q\u2264Q such that:\n\u2200(p, q), c\u0302pq def =\n{ 0 if q = p\nd\u0302pq otherwise, (9)\n\u2200(p, q), cpq def = { 0 if q = p dpq = P(x,y)\u223cD(f(x) = q|p = y) otherwise.\n(10)\nNote that if f correctly classifies every example of a given sample S, then the empirical confusion matrix CfS is equal to 0. Similarly, if f is a perfect classifier over the distribution D, then the true confusion matrix is equal to 0. Aiming at controlling the confusion matrix of a classifier is therefore a relevant task. More precisely, one may aim at a confusion matrix that is \u2018small\u2019, where \u2018small\u2019 means as close to 0 as possible. As we shall see, the size of a confusion matrix will be measured by its operator norm."}, {"heading": "4.2 Main Result: Confusion PAC-Bayes Bound for the Gibbs Classifier", "text": "Our main result is a PAC-Bayes generalization bound that holds for the Gibbs classifier GQ in the particular context of multiclass prediction, where the empirical and true error measures are respectively given by the confusion matrices defined by (9) and (10).

Remark the error rate P (f(x) 6= y) of a classifier f might be directly computed as the 1-norm of tCfp with p the vector of prior class probabilities. A route to get results based on the confusion matrix would then be to have a bound on the induced 1- norm of C (which is defined by: max \u2016tCfp\u20161/\u2016p\u20161). However, we do not have at hand concentration\nTechnical Report V 4.0 4\ninequalities for the 1-norm of matrices and but we only have at our disposal such concentration inequalities for the operator norm.

The purpose of the following corollary is to restate the Theorem 3 so that it carries over to matrices that are not self-adjoint. It is central to us to have such a result as the matrices we are dealing with, namely confusion matrices, are rarely symmetric.\nCorollary 3.

We consider the sequence {S(Mi)} of random self-adjoint matrices with dimension 2Q. By the definition of the dilation, we directly obtain EiS(Mi) = 0. From Equation (4), the dilation preserves the spectral information. Thus, on the one hand, we have:\n\u2016 \u2211 i Mi\u2016 = \u03bbmax ( S (\u2211 i Mi )) = \u03bbmax (\u2211 i S(Mi) ) .\nOn the other hand, we have:\n\u2016Mi\u2016 = \u2016S(Mi)\u2016 = \u03bbmax ( S(Mi) ) \u2264 ai.\nTo assure the hypothesis S(Mi)2 4 A2i , we need to find a suitable sequence of fixed self-adjoint matrices {Ai} of dimension 2Q (where 4 refers to the semidefinite order on self-adjoint matrices).

Given an example (xi, yi) \u2208 S, the example-based confusion matrix contains at most one non zero-element when f misclassifies (xi, yi). In the same way, when f correctly classifies (xi, yi) then the example-based confusion matrix is equal to 0. Concretely, for every sample S = {(xi, yi)}mi=1 and every f \u2208 F , our error measure is then\nCfS = m\u2211 i=1 Cfi .\nIt naturally appears that we penalize only when f errs.

Equation (17) is then equivalent to:\n\u2200p, q, c\u0302\u2032pq(i) def = { 0 if c\u0302pq(i) = 0 c\u0302pq(i)\u2212 1myi ES\u223c(D)m c\u0302pq otherwise.\nFor sake of clarity, given an example (xi, yi) and for every S \u223c (D)m, we denote CfS|i the matrix with at most one non-zero element of coordinates (p, q) equals to c\u0302pq with p = yi and q = h(xi).

Some perspectives will be focused on instantiating our bound given in Theorem 2 for specific multi-class frameworks, such as multi-class SVM Weston and Watkins (1998); Crammer and Singer (2002); Lee et al. (2004) and multi-class boosting (AdaBoost.MH/AdaBoost.MR Schapire and Singer (2000), SAMME Zhu et al. (2009), AdaBoost.MM Mukherjee and Schapire (2011)). Taking advantage of our theorem while using the confusion matrices, may allow us to derive new generalization bounds for these methods.\nAdditionally, we are interested in seeing how effective learning methods may be derived from the risk bound we propose. For instance, in the binary PAC-Bayes setting, the algorithm MinCq proposed by\nTechnical Report V 4.0 9\nLaviolette et al. (2011) minimizes a bound depending on the first two moments of the margin of the Q-weighted majority vote. From our Theorem 2 and with a similar study, we would like to design a new multi-class learning algorithm and observe how sound such an algorithm could be. This would probably require the derivation of a Cantelli-Tchebycheff deviation inequality in the matrix case.\nBesides, it might be very interesting to see how the noncommutative/matrix concentration inequalities provided by Tropp (2011) might be of some use for other kinds of learning problem such as multi-label classification, label ranking problems or structured prediction issues.\nFinally, the question of extending the present work to the analysis of algorithms learning (possibly infinite-dimensional) operators as Abernethy et al. (2009) is also very exciting."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we propose a new PAC-Bayesian generalization bound that applies in the multi-class classification setting. The originality of our contribution is that we consider the confusion matrix as an error measure. Coupled with the use of the operator norm on matrices, we are capable of providing generalization bound on the \u2018size\u2019 of confusion matrix (with the idea that the smaller the norm of the confusion matrix of the learned classifier, the better it is for the classification task at hand). The derivation of our result takes advantage of the concentration inequality proposed by Tropp (2011) for the sum of random self-adjoint matrices, that we directly adapt to square matrices which are not self-adjoint.\nThe main results are presented in Theorem 2 and Corollary 1. The bound in Theorem 2 is given on the difference between the true risk of the Gibbs classifier and its empirical error. While the one given in Corollary 1 upper-bounds the risk of the Gibbs classifier by its empirical error. Moreover we have bound the risk of the Bayes classifier by the one of the Gibbs classifier.\nAn interesting point is that our bound depends on the minimal quantity m\u2212 of training examples belonging to the same class, for a given number of classes. If this value increases, i.e. if we have a lot of training examples, then the empirical confusion matrix of the Gibbs classifier tends to be close to its true confusion matrix. A point worth noting is that the bound varies as O(1/ \u221a m\u2212), which is a typical rate in bounds not using second-order information. The present work gives rise to a few algorithmic and theoretical questions that we have discussed in the previous section.\nAppendix\nTheorem 3 (Concentration Inequality for Random Matrices Tropp (2011)).

When specialized to appropriate function spaces F and relevant families of prior and posterior distributions, PAC-Bayes bounds can be used to characterize the error of a few existing classification methods. An example deals with the risk of methods based upon the idea of the majority vote in the case of binary classification. We may notice that if Q is the posterior distribution, the error of the Q-weighted majority vote classifier, which makes a prediction for x according to \u2211 f f(x)Q(f), is bounded by twice the error of the Gibbs classifier. If the classifiers from F on which the distribution Q puts a lot of weight are good enough, then the bound on the risk of the Gibbs classifier can be an informative bound for the risk of the Q-weighted majority vote.

The novelty of our work is the critical use of the confusion matrix of a classifier as an error measure; this puts our contribution in the line of work aiming at dealing with performance measure that are richer than mere scalar criterion such as the misclassification rate. Thanks to very recent and beautiful results on matrix concentration inequalities, we derive two bounds showing that the true confusion risk of the Gibbs classifier is upper-bounded by its empirical risk plus a term depending on the number of training examples in each class. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first PAC-Bayes bounds based on confusion matrices.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
