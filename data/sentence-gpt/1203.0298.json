KEYWORDS: Pattern classification, Gist SVM, F-Score\nIntroduction\nPattern classification problems can be effectively solved by Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [CV95; Vap98]. SVMs find applications in data mining, bioinformatics, computer vision, and pattern recognition. There is a need to accelerate SVM training as the size of the training data sets is becoming larger.\nIn this paper, we study the application of SVM in the prediction of\ncancer using the GIST SVM. SVM is a class of learning methods that can be used for classification. The problem of the optimal feature selection plays a vital role in SVM which ensures high performance classification. Nonoptimal features ensure robustness since SVMs are trained for maximized margins.\nThis paper is structured as follows. Section 1 gives a brief\nintroduction to SVM classifier and the f-score method used for feature selection, In Section 2, we discuss the results obtained and concluding remarks are given in Section 3 to address further research issues."}, {"heading": "1. Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"heading": "1.1. Support Vector Machines", "text": "The use of the maximum-margin hyper plane is motivated by\nVapnik Chervonenkis theory, which provides a probabilistic test error bound that is minimized when the margin is maximized.\nThe parameters of the maximum-margin hyper plane are derived by\nsolving a quadratic programming (QP) optimization problem. There exist several specialized algorithms for quickly solving the QP problem that arises from SVMs.\nIn training SVMs, the decision boundaries are determined directly\nfrom the training data so that the generalization ability is maximized. Therefore, the generalization ability of the SVM is quite different from those of other classifiers, especially when the number of training data is small. Here we propose to use Gist (http://svm.sdsc.edu) to perform all the training and testing. Gist is an implementation of the SVM algorithm.\nTo apply SVM in training and testing the practical data sets, one has\nto determine the size of the training set and the optimal features. We attempt to find the optimum size for the training set and the test set because the time complexity of training an SVM is in the order of n 2 , where n is the number of training samples [Pla98; Joa98].\nWe used Wisconsin breast cancer (WBC) dataset which has 699\ninstances (Benign: 458 Malignant: 241) of which 16 instances has missing attribute values removing that we have 683 instances of which 444 benign and 239 are malignant. This breast cancer database was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H.Wolberg available in UCI Machine learning depository http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml).\nFeatures are computed from a digitized image of a Fine Needle\nAspiration (FNA). The feature extraction process is performed as follows: An FNA is taken from the breast mass. This material is then mounted on a microscope slide and stained to highlight the cellular nuclei. A portion of the slide in which the cells are well differentiated is then scanned using a digital camera and a frame-grabber board and identified nine visually assessed characteristics of an FNA sample, which he considered relevant to diagnosis. The resulting data set is well-known as the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data.\nMost breast cancers are detected by the patient as a lump in the\nbreast. The majority of breast lumps are benign so it is the physician\u2019s responsibility to diagnose breast cancer, that is, to distinguish benign lumps from malignant ones. There are three available methods for diagnosing breast cancer: Mammography, FNA (with visual interpretation) and surgical biopsy. The reported sensitivity (i.e., ability to correctly diagnose cancer when the disease is present) of Mammography varies from 68% to 79%, of FNA with visual interpretation from 65% to 98%, and of surgical biopsy close to 100%. Therefore, mammography lacks sensitivity, FNA sensitivity varies widely, and surgical biopsy, although accurate, is invasive, time consuming, and costly. The goal of the diagnostic aspect of this research is to develop a relatively objective system."}, {"heading": "1.2. The F-score Method", "text": "The F-score is used to measure the discrimination of two sets of real numbers [Ak09]. Given training vectors xk; k = 1; 2; _ _ _; l, and the number of positive and negative instances are n + and n - respectively, then the F-score of the ith feature is defined as:\n(1)\nwhere , and are the average of the i th feature of the whole, positive and negative datasets respectively, and is the i th feature of the k th positive instance and i th feature of the k th negative instance.\nThe numerator of the above equation indicates the discrimination between the positive and negative sets and denominator the one within each subset. The larger the F-score is, the more likely this feature is discriminative. This score is hence used as a feature selection criterion.\nThe procedure is summarized as follows:"}, {"heading": "1.

From the results, we see that the gist SVM is able to train a classifier with weight and discriminant. Let D be the discriminant value. Then, according to the discriminant value D, we can classify the new data point into the positive class if D > 0, and classify it into the negative class when D < 0.\nTable 2.

In other words, we need to find the optimal size of the training set and the features. In training a SVM, the decision boundaries are determined directly from the training data so that the generalization ability is maximized. Moreover, one needs to solve a quadratic optimization problem with the number of variables equal to the number of training data. We note that determining the optimal size of the training set is important in improving the classification rate. To find the optimal size of the training set, we will try different sizes of training sets and see which one can achieve the highest classification rate. Table 4 gives the classification rate when the number of training-test partitions is 50-50, 60-40, 70-30, 80-20 and 40-60 respectively. From Table 4, one can see that the best classification rate is reached when we choose 50-50 training -test partitions.\nTable 4.

Bar chart for Table 4\nTo investigate potential predictive value of these candidates, we next\nrank these 9 features based on their scores generated using F-score. Then we train the SVM. Here we used 4 sample sets to train SVM (Set 1 contains datasets with features 1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,9, Set 2 contains datasets with features 1,2,3,4,6,7,9, Set 3 contains datasets with features 1, 2, 3,6,7,9 and Set 4 contains datasets with features 1, 3, 6, 7, 9). The results obtained are presented in Table 5. From the table, we see that the best classification rate is reached when we choose the top five features. 2,4,5,8 considered to be weak features according to the f-score. After removing those features one by one did not make much difference in the accuracy of classification of the samples.\nTable 5.

Here we trained the datasets in Gist. In this study we tried to find out the optimum size of the training test partitions and optimum number of features for the dataset using SVM and F-score combination.
