Several approaches have been proposed to measure the similarity between sequences in trajectory data. Most of these measures are based on Euclidean space or on spatial network and some of them have been concerned with temporal aspect or ordering types. However, they are not appropriate to characteristics of spatiotemporal mobility patterns in wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a new similarity measure for mobility patterns in cellular space of wireless network. The framework for constructing our measure is composed of two phases as follows. First, we present formal definitions to capture mathematically two spatial and temporal similarity measures for mobility patterns. And then, we define the total similarity measure by means of a weighted combination of these similarities. The truth of the partial and total similarity measures are proved in mathematics. Furthermore, instead of the time interval or ordering, our work makes use of the timestamp at which two mobility patterns share the same cell. A case study is also described to give a comparison of the combination measure with other ones. For example, in the second phase of our study, we introduce the fact that the space of one cell has been identified using the number of milliseconds on which time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds. For example, in the third phase, when two mobility patterns share the same cell, the time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds on which time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds on which time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds. Lastly, we introduce a similar mathematical technique to classify spatial space and time intervals on which time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds on which time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds on which time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds on which time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds on which time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds on which time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds on which time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds on which time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds on which time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds on which time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds on which time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds on which time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds on which time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds on which time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds on which time interval has been identified using the number of milliseconds on which time", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 Jun 2012 07:58:18 GMT  (397kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1418v1", "15 pages, 2 figures; International Journal of Computer Networks &amp; Communications (IJCNC)this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 2 figures; International Journal of Computer Networks &amp; Communications (IJCNC)this http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["thuy van t duong", "dinh que tran", "cong hung tran"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.1418"}, "pdf": {"name": "1206.1418.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A WEIGHTED COMBINATION SIMILARITY MEASURE FOR MOBILITY PATTERNS IN WIRELESS NETWORKS", "authors": ["Thuy Van T.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "With the development of mobile computing and wireless communications, discovering knowledge about the movement of various groups of mobile objects in wireless networks has become critical in their mobility prediction. Although different mobile objects express differences in their movement behavior and the nature of their movement but they typically share similarities [1]. Discovering such similarities contributes significantly to predicting the next location of a mobile object based on the behaviors of members in a group.\nIn our work [2], the prediction of the next location of a mobile object is only based on its own movement history. However, the incompleteness on information of movement history results in the lack of extracted mobility rules and may affect the accuracy of prediction. In this paper, we consider that with knowledge of groups to which a mobile object belongs, one can derive common behaviors among objects during their moving. Therefore, it is possible to predict the next location of an object based on the movement behavior of its group. And in turn,\nthe behavior of a group of mobile objects is determined in terms of the similarity of movement patterns, which represent a homogeneous kind of correlations of behaviors of objects in wireless networks. The analysis of moving objects (i.e., entities whose positions or geometric attributes change over time) has recently attracted a great deal of studies, especially, investigating their trajectories (i.e. paths objects passed through in space and time). Measuring the similarity between trajectories and then clustering them are becoming crucial for movement prediction of mobile objects [3].\nApproaches for computing the similarity between sequences in trajectory data of moving objects may be grouped into two classes. On the one hand, the methods based on Euclidean space such as in [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] consider similarity with the Euclidean distance. On the other hand, some works [9] [10] [11] have investigated the spatial and temporal properties of patterns but with interval temporal aspect. And then two patterns passing through the same area at different times are considered to be similar. These measures may be not appropriate to spatiotemporal characteristics of cellular space in wireless network. A more detail description and analysis of these measures are postponed to Section 2.\nOur contribution in this paper is to introduce a new similarity measure of mobility patterns. Our approach to constructing a such measure is to deal with two constraints. First, the measure should be based on the characteristics of the mobility in wireless network, in which a location of mobile objects is referenced with the cell identifier. Second, the measure needs to represent spatial and temporal similarities simultaneously. It means that two patterns passing through the same cell at the same time must be considered more similar than the case where there is no common timestamp. Our similarity measure is computed as a weighted combination of spatial and temporal ones. The assertion on its truth will be presented in mathematical proof and then a comparable computation between this measure with some other measures is given in a case study.\nThe remainder of this paper is constructed as follows. In Section 2, a review of approaches to similarity measurement in trajectory data is introduced. Section 3 presents the model of the mobility in wireless networks and Section 4 investigates a new similarity measure between mobility patterns. In Section 5, we describe a case study for comparing various similarity measures of mobility patterns. Section 6 is some discussions. Finally, Section 7 draws concluding remarks and further work."}, {"heading": "2. OVERVIEW OF SIMILARITY MEASURES", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1. Similarity Measures for Euclidean Space", "text": "The similarity measures for trajectory data in Euclidean space with the referenced location of coordinates have been widely considered in various research areas. Lin et al. [4] proposed a searching method for similar trajectories by focusing on the spatial shapes and comparing spatial shapes of moving object trajectories. Searching algorithms based on evaluating OWD (one way distance) in both continuous and discrete cases of the trajectories have been developed. However, their searching scheme OWD is time independent and based on Euclidean distance. Therefore, it is not appropriate to comparing two trajectories in cellular space of wireless network.\nAnother method for measuring the similarity between trajectories based on spatio-temporal representation was introduced by Zeinalipour-Yazti et. al. [5]. They proposed a distributed spatio-temporal similarity measure using the LCSS (longest common subsequence) distance. Their approach performs local computations of partial lower and upper bounds at each cell and then combines these partial results to give upper and lower bounds. However, this scheme also assumes Euclidean space, it is difficult to apply it to spatial networks [11]. Some other effective similarity measures were proposed in [6] [7] [8] but they have the same representation of\nEuclidean space as [4] [5]. Due to the spatial and temporal properties of wireless networks, these methods are no longer useful."}, {"heading": "2.2. Similarity Measures without Temporal Aspect", "text": "The most important studies of similar trajectories which are suitable for spatial networks are presented in [9] and [10]. These studies consider that geographically close trajectories may not necessarily be similar since the activities implied by nearby landmarks they pass through may be different. Jia-Ching Ying et. al. [9] proposed a novel approach for measuring the semantic similarity between trajectories, namely, Maximal Semantic Trajectory Pattern Similarity (MSTP-Similarity). After transforming the geographic trajectory set to the semantic trajectory dataset, they utilized the sequential pattern mining algorithm Prefix-Span to mine the frequent semantic trajectories called semantic trajectory patterns. And then they used the Longest Common Sequence (LCS) of two patterns to represent their longest common part and defined MSTP-Similarity based on the participation ratio of the common part to a pattern. MSTPSimilarity argued that two trajectory patterns are more similar when they have more common parts. However, the disadvantage of this model is that it did not take temporal property into account. For example, two trajectory patterns passing through the same area at different times are considered to be similar. Consequently, it is not suitable to spatio-temporal domains.\nA similarity measure based on sequential mobility patterns with time and space has been considered by Pandi et. al. [1]. They stated that the main feature of sequence data is the order of sequential elements. Thus, they proposed a new sequence similarity measure that focused on the ordering feature of sequences. Their evaluation results showed the superiority of the measure compared to other evaluated measures. However, this method has the same problem of temporal property as [9]."}, {"heading": "2.3. Similarity Measures of Networks with Simultaneously Spatiotemporal Consideration", "text": "To the best of our knowledge, studying the spatial network constraints by taking both spatial and temporal properties of patterns into account is satisfactory. Firstly, the work given by Tiakas et. al. [12] used the network distance instead of the Euclidean distance. The spatial network is modeled as a directed graph, and the network distance is defined by using algorithms for shortest paths between the nodes of the graph as follows. Let Dnet(Ta, Tb) be a distance between two trajectories and ),...,,( 21 amaaa vvvT = ),...,,( 21 bmbbb vvvT = of length m.

In addition to Dnet(Ta, Tb), they also compute the time similarity Dtime(Ta, Tb) between two trajectories as follows:\n[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]{ }\u2211= \u2212+\u2212+ \u2212+\u2212\u2212+ \u2212 = m i bbaa bbaa batime tiTtiTtiTtiT tiTtiTtiTtiT m TTD 1 )..1(),..1(max )..1()..1( 1 1),(\nIn order to take both spatial and temporal properties into account, they combined the two distance measures Dnet and Dtime into a single one:\n),(.),(.),( batimetimebanetnetbatotal TTDWTTDWTTD +=\nwhere Wnet + Wtime=1\nThe advantage of this approach is that it utilizes network distance and takes into spatiotemporal aspects account simultaneously. However, geographically close trajectories may not necessarily be similar in some real applications [9]. For example, in Figure 1, although the geographic distance between Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 is closer than that between Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 3, both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 3 pass through the same locations <School, Park, Restaurant>. Thus, Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 3 are considered more similar to each other than to Trajectory 2. Such an approach is inconvenient to apply to our model of wireless network.\nSecondly, Kang et. al. [13] used cellular space instead of Euclidean space in order to con\nwhere a .c and b .c are the i-th and j-th visited cell by a and b respectively. The LCSS means the\neasure for\nstruct the similarity between the patterns of moving objects. According to [13], the location is referenced by cells rather than coordinates in real world. For example, we refer the location of an object in a building by the room number. In order to process a spatial query \u201cWho are in the room 406?\u201d, the location referenced by room identifier is more useful than (x, y) coordinates. Based on this observation, Kang et. al. defined two similarity measures by using LCSS, which had been originally proposed to analyze the similarity between sequences. Furthermore, they simultaneously take spatial and temporal properties of trajectory patterns into account which are not fully considered by LCSS. Firstly, Kang et. al. defined spatial similarity LCSSa,b(n, m) where a and b are two trajectory patterns and n and m are the numbers of cells visited by a and b respectively as follows:\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( )\u23aa\u23a9\n\u23aa \u23a8\n\u23a7\n\u2212\u2212\n=>>+\u2212\u2212 == =\notherwise ,,1,1,\n.. ,0,0 if ,11,1 0or 0 if ,0 ,\n,,\n,,\njiLCSSjiLCSSmax\ncbcajijiLCSS ji jiLCSS\nbaba\njibaba\ni j longest common sequence of cells of patterns. A large value of LCSS means that two patterns share a long subsequence of visits at cells and have a high similarity.\nIn order to overcome the shortcoming of LCSS, [13] proposed a new definition of m patterns similarity Common Visit Time Interval (CVTI) between two trajectory patterns a\nand b. CVTI implies the sum of time interval that a and b stay at the same cells:\n\u2211 =\u2229= mn cbcaIbIabaCVTI ,\n.. where,..),( == ji jiji 1,1\nThus, their approach focuses on similarity measure with the time interval which is different fro\nmethods for our purpose is defined by G\u00b4omez-Alonso et. al.\nm the timestamp as in our work.\nFinally, one of the most suitable [14]. Their main purpose is to measure a similarity of sequences of events representing the behavior of the user in a particular context such as sequences of web pages visited by a certain user or the personal daily schedule. This measure is based on the comparison of the common elements (i.e. events such as web pages, places, etc.) in two sequences and the positions where\nthey appear. The former computes if the two individuals have done the same things, e.g if they have visited the same web pages or have gone to the same places. The later takes into account the temporal sequence of the events, e.g., if two tourists have visited the place A after going to the place B or not.\nFor example, let T1 and T2 be tourists who have visited some places of the same city: T1={a, b,\nwhere\nc} and T2={c, a, b, d}. There are 3 common places and also they have visited a before b. So they are quite similar. In order to take into account these two issues, the new measure called Ordering-based Sequence Similarity (OSS) consists, on one hand, of finding the common elements in the two sequences, and on the other hand, in comparing the positions of the elements in both sequences. Let i and j be two sequences of items of different lengths, i = (xi,1, \u2026, xi,card(i)) and j =(xj,1, \u2026, xj,card(j)). Let L = {l1, \u2026, ln} be a set of n symbols to represent all the possible elements of those sequences (L is called a language). Then, the OSS is defined as:\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )jcardicard jigjifjidOSS + + = ,,,\n( ) { }( ) { }( )ixxcardjxxcardjig jkjkikik \u2209+\u2209= ||, and\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) ( ){ }jcardicard\npjpi jif\nn\nk p ll kk\n,max , 1 1\n\u2211 \u2211 =\n\u2206 = \u239f\u239f \u23a0 \u239e \u239c\u239c \u239d \u239b \u2212\n=\nwhere ( ) ( ){ } ( )( ) ( )( ){ }kkk llkl jcardicardltiti ,min and | =\u2206== . The um measure OSS has two parts, g is counting the n ber of non common elements, and f me\nn the two patterns may be no longer use\nasures the similarity in the position of the elements in the sequences (the ordering). If two sequences are equal, the result of dOSS is zero, because the positions are always equal (f = 0) and there are not uncommon elements (g = 0). Conversely, if the two sequences do not share any element, then g = card(i) + card(j) and f = 0, and dOSS is equal to 1 when it is divided by card(i) + card(j). The values of dOSS are always between 0 and 1.\nHowever, the ordering between the common elements i ful for our purpose. For example, let S1 and S2 be two trajectory patterns: S1={(1, t1), (0, t3), (5, t4), (6, t6), (7, t9)} and S2={(0, t3), (5, t4), (7, t9)}. Cells 0, 5 and 7 are common in both patterns S1 and S2. Since these two patterns pass through the same cells at the same times, they must be considered temporal similar, even though they are not similar in OSS measure due to f(S1, S2) = 0.8 > 0. This computing result is obtained as follows: S1(0) = {1} and S2(0) = {0}, so f(0)(S1, S2) = |1-0| = 1. Similarly, f(5)(S1, S2) = |2-1| = 1 and f(7)(S1, S2) = |4-2| = 2.\nSo 8.0 5 211)2,1()2,1()2,1( )7()5()0( =++= )}2(),1(max{ )2,1( ++ = SSfSSfSSf SSf ScardScard\nThe problem arisen in the measure given by G\u00b4omez-Alonso et. al.

In this work, we analyze the individual mobility patterns of lecturers in a campus wireless network. For example, the movement of lecturers depends on the schedule of classes. It means that he will move to the classrooms at the times according to his own teaching schedule. Therefore, it is possible to set the time interval every three teaching periods. A teaching period is 45 minutes so the time interval is 135 minutes.

Our approach is based on intuition that two patterns must be considered temporally similar when they pass through the same cells at the same time.\nFor example, let S1 = {(1, t1), (0, t3), (5, t4), (6, t6), (7, t9)} and S2 = {(0, t3), (5, t4), (7, t9)} be two mobility patterns. In this context, there are 3 common cells 0, 5 and 7, and they have passed through cell 0 at t3, cell 5 at t4 and cell 7 at t9. Therefore, two these patterns are considered temporally similar.

DISCUSSIONS ches in computing the similarity between sequences in trajectory data of moving objects. Most of them have focused on Euclidean space or not fully exploited the spatial and temporal properties of mobility patterns.

However, geographically close trajectories may not necessarily be similar since the activities implied by nearby landmarks they pass through may be different. In wireless networks, the more common cells two trajectory patterns share, the more similar they must be considered.\nSecond, Kang et. al. [13] proposed measure LCSSa,b(n, m) based on cellular space instead of Euclidean space. Since LCSSa,b(n, m) is given in recursive form, it may result in large computational complexity. Moreover, the similarity measure CVTI [13] is concerned with time interval, our one is based on the model of timestamp in wireless network.\nFinally, the method that is most closely related to our a pproach has been given by C.

[14]. Their approach computes the spatial similarity measure for sequences of events based on the number of common elements in these sequences. However, the temporal aspect in their approach is the ordering between the common elements in two sequences, rather than the timestamp as in our model.\nIn general, our proposed similarity measure differs from the existing measures in two aspects. First, due to the properties of wireless networks, the spatial similarity measure is based on the number of common elements in two patterns. It means that two trajectory patterns must be considered more similar when they share more common cells. Second, our temporal similarity measure takes into account\nls at the same times or not. Intuitively, two patterns passing through the same cells at the same times must be considered more temporal similar than the case they stayed at the different times.

However, they are not appropriate to characteristics of spatiotemporal mobility patterns in wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a new similarity measure for mobility patterns in cellular space of wireless network. The framework for constructing our measure is composed of two phases as follows. First, we present formal definitions to capture mathematically two spatial and temporal similarity measures for mobility patterns. And then, we define the total similarity measure by means of a weighted combination of these similarities. The truth of the partial and total similarity measures are proved in mathematics. Furthermore, instead of the time interval or ordering, our work makes use of the timestamp at which two mobility patterns share the same cell.
