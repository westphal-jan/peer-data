Third, our class class was created using a function called mnk3 to compute the rank in the class.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "Since the middle of 20 th century when artificial intelligence science was established, classification methods were too important. By the pass of time, datasets that were used for classification got more complex than past such as geographic or discovery dataset. One of the items that increase the complexity of dataset is the number of dimensions (features). So a new concept called feature reduction was inducted in the literature of AI (Fukunnaga 1991) [4].\nFukunnaga said, If we describe input data as a matrix like X= { \u2026 . . } , where \"n\" is the sample number and \"m\" is the original feature dimensions, So the purpose of linear feature extraction is to search for a projection matrix like W \u2032 that transforms into a desired low-dimensional representation \u2032 , where \u2032 W .\nTypically, the projection matrix W is learnt by optimizing a criterion describing certain desired or undesired statistical or geometric properties of the data set. Different criterions lead to different kinds of linear feature exaction algorithms. Among them, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Joliffe, 1986) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (Fukunnaga, 1991) have been the two most popular ones owing to their simplicity and effectiveness. Another popular technique called Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) (He & Niyogi, 2004) [5], has been proposed for linear feature extraction by preserving the local relationships within the data set. In (Yan et al., 2007) [1], many classical linear feature extraction techniques are unified into\na common framework known as Graph Embedding. To avoid the high time and memory usage associated with eigenvalue decomposition in LDA, the Spectral Regression Discriminant Analysis (SRDA) (Cai et al., 2008) [2], was proposed based on ridge regression.\nNow the output dataset Y is in a low-dimensional so the complexity of classification Y and the time of that are less. Also, computation complexity of Y for any other cases is less than X. It\u2019s easy to know that feature extraction wastes some pieces of the dataset\u2019s information. All of the methods for feature extraction are common in this object, so algorithms try to find a better formula for matrix W to decrease the amount of waste information to decrease the miss classification error rate of output(Y). Almost none of the previous methods have a good generalization for each kind of different datasets. To solve this problem, in this paper we present an approach to adapt the input dataset with every feature extraction methods. First we present a new concept called Dispelling Classes Gradually (DCG) to increase severability and separability of classes based on their labels and then we process the original input dataset with DCG and create a new dataset as an input dataset of the feature extraction methods to decrease the amount of misclassification error rate on its output rather than original situation."}, {"heading": "1.1. PAPER ORGANIZION", "text": "The reminder of this paper is organized as follows: Section two is related to the description of Dispelling Classes Gradually technique (DCG) and the way of this estimation. In the section three the proposed approach is described. Section four has justification about quality of proposed approach. In section five necessary parameters are tuned. Section six is related to the description of proposed approach\u2019s noise insensitivity. Finally, the results and conclusion included."}, {"heading": "2. DCG CONCEPT", "text": "In the numerical datasets, misclassification error rate decreases with increasing the distance between classes[14]. So it\u2019s necessary and beneficial to increase these distances. In the basic mathematics it\u2019s determined that if two different numbers like be subtracted two another fix numbers like , respectively, and this action get repeated for \u03b1 times, where , it\u2019s authenticate that in extreme , the distance between will be more than first generation. This principal is shown in figure (1).\nIf we assume class labels to numeric labels and then assign for class labels, separability of classes increases at extreme situation by subtracting each class label from its sample value in available features. This subject is described in (1).\nX \u03b1L X \u03b1L !\" # X X (1)\nWhere, Xi is the ith sample and Xj is the jth sample and L is the class label of Xi and L ! is the class label of Xj . Figure (2) shows the results of applying (1) on Iris (UCI Dataset) on two features. There is a same authentication for negative numbers of \u03b1. If the numbers of \u03b1 be negative just changes the orientation of classes move, but result of applying DCG is same as positive \u03b1 values. According to figure (2) and formula (1), the distances between all samples of each class doesn\u2019t change also variance of each class, but separability of classes increase by dispelling mean of the classes."}, {"heading": "3. PROPOSED APPROACH", "text": "According to previous part, DCG is too beneficial to increase separability of classes. But DCG does its process based on class labels. So on test set, DCG is not useful because we don\u2019t know sample labels. But for train set, its may be useful. According to introduction part, all of feature extraction methods try to describe an accurate approach to create projection matrix W based on train set. So if DCG increases separability of train set before using to create projection matrix and then dimension reduced output dataset is compute based on projection matrix, then misclassification error rate of output decreases and output set Y classifiers easily get more than output of original input set.\nTo implement this method, sample labels of train set assume to be represented as a matrix C= [$ \u2026 . . $ ] % %& , where N is the number of samples and '( is the number of labels and the elements of the indicator vector ) is set to be 1 to '( . Then do *+ ), for - times. This method has 3 important advantages. (A) Adapting dataset with feature extraction method (B) the results never are worse than original manner. (C) Increasing the noise tolerability of dataset.\n(A) According to introduction part, if the input dataset of feature reduction be original just there is a fix output. The misclassification error rate of this fix output probably won\u2019t be\ndesired. But with using our method it\u2019s possible to adapt input set with feature reduction method more than primitive manner. By using optimal - it\u2019s possible to create a better output with lower misclassification error rate than original output. (B) If the number of \u03b1 be zero, original input and processed input are same so the feature extraction\u2019s outputs of them are same and there is not any difference between\nmisclassification error rates.\n(C) One of the motivations that is presented for feature extraction methods is noise tolerability. In almost the entire feature extraction methods if noise sits on input dataset,\nthe misclassification error rate of output gets more than original manner. But our method can cover this motivation to a large extent. Our method does this action based on two features that are hidden in its formula.\nFirst feature is \u03b1. If the input dataset is noisy we can compute the optimal \u03b1 to adapt feature\nreduction method with noisy dataset. It\u2019s useful to calculate an output with error rate close the situation that input set is not noisy. Second feature is C. one of the methods that is presented to decrease the effect of noise is using fuzzy. In matrix C there is a concept like fuzzy which is hidden. When we subtract sample\u2019s values of their labels in reality we subtract sample\u2019s values of all of the labels just with different coefficient. Because all of labels are coefficients for the other ones.\n+ + -./0 , +1 +1 -./2\nIf ./0 3./2 4 + + 3-./2 (2)\nTo understand better, the flowchart of proposed approach is shown in figure3. Also it is compared with popular feature reduction approaches without train set processing."}, {"heading": "4. JUSTFICATION", "text": "The main question which is mentioned in this article is that why applying DCG concept on input dataset could increase the quality of feature reduction approaches. This question will be answered true this section. Almost all feature reduction approaches purpose is to describe new dimensions which have two below mentioned signification based on finding the mean, variance, and eigenvectors of each class in input dataset.\n(A) The first signification is that new dimensions are less than original dimensions (B) The second signification is that separability of classes ability is saved as far as possible.\nAs described in section two after processing the input dataset by DCG, both slope of each eigenvector and variance of each class remain constant and this happened because the transfer amount of each sample is equal to transfer amount of the same class\u2019s samples. Consequently, the main section of feature reduction approaches which is finding slope of eigenvectors, and variance of classes will be remained constant and only mean of each class will be changed. This subject is shown in figure (4). As it is shown in figure (4), the slope of eigenvectors of dataset is not changed after processing the dataset by DCG.\nFigure4. Effect of DCG on Mean and eigenvectors of one of the classes of iris dataset\nAccording to proposed approach, it is asserted by transferring coordination of different classes\u2019s mean, and distance between mean, it is possible to find the new coordination for each means and in this situation classification accuracy rate of feature reduction approach output is higher than original input dataset. Briefly, this article is mainly trying to show that by using DCG for processing input dataset, the feature reduction output error rate will be less than when input dataset is not processed."}, {"heading": "5. PARAMETER SELECTION", "text": "To process input dataset of feature extraction methods there is just an input parameter. The number of DCG Loop called \u03b1 is an important parameter. \u0391 should tune correctly to fulfill our aims. To select \u03b1 there are two important points to pay attention. (I) according to DCG part, DCG avouch the separability of classes in infinite situation .So there are some values for \u03b1 at each dataset that \u03b1 doesn\u2019t dispel classes enough and it\u2019s possible that some of its values decrease the separability of classes. Because the move orientations of classes for dispelling are hidden, maybe the move orientation of a class is like another one and of course their speeds are never the same, so for some of \u03b1 values, it\u2019s possible that classes come near each other and their distances are less than primitive situation. This range of \u03b1 is called loop\u2019s problem maker range (LPMR), so we need the values that are out of this range. (II) But the second point to select \u03b1 refers to feature extraction method. Using DCG method to process input datasets certainly changes the values of samples in each feature so it\u2019s important that these transforms don\u2019t cause\nproblem for feature extraction algorithms. Because in some of the feature extraction algorithms there are some formula that don\u2019t work correctly with every values. For example one of the new feature extraction methods that is presented in ICML 2009 by XiaoTong and Bao-Gang is REDA [8]. This method calculates the best projection matrix W in an iterative manner. In their algorithm there is a formula that computes an item by this form: exp (- 56 ) 5 /8 ,. we know exponential of numbers of more than 30 is too huge and less than - 13 is considered as zero for all cases. So it\u2019s important that new value of X after process don\u2019t be out of this bound. For solving this problem we can compute the good range of \u03b1 by (3).where\nis the minimum value in samples of 9:; sample\u2019s label\n< *6 -./0 ) , /8 < => (3)\nBecause of using just input dataset, there aren\u2019t any other parameters which are affected on accuracy rate of proposed approach.\nAccording to these points and basic theory of the DCG concept, the misclassification error rates of feature extraction\u2019s outputs are different for different numbers of \u03b1. In the table (1) for example we computed the accuracy of the SRDA\u2019s outputs of the input dataset (Haber-man) after applying DCG based on numbers of \u03b1 between numbers 1 to 30."}, {"heading": "SRDA", "text": "According to the table (1), we plan the figure (5) based on numbers of \u03b1 Between 1 to 60. According to the figure (5), the amount of the feature extraction\u2019s outputs accuracies has tolerance, so there are some local optimums and a global optimum. The authors suggest hill climbing algorithms or simple genetic algorithm (J.Holland 1970\u2019s) with a fitness function based on output set\u2019s misclassification error rate to compute best value of \u03b1 (Global optimum).\nFigure.5. Tolerance of feature extraction output\u2019s accuracy based on different \u03b1"}, {"heading": "6. NOISE INSENSITIVITY", "text": "One of the most advantages of the proposed approach is noise insensitivity. According to different problems that occur, some of numeric values in dataset will change, it called noise. So, by occurring noise the quality of feature reduction approaches certainly decrease. By using the proposed approach, after doing some of DCG loops, the noise samples will nearing to another samples which have same labels, so, the effect of noise samples in the performance of feature reduction approaches will decrease."}, {"heading": "7. RESULTS", "text": "In this part the misclassification error rate of our idea and original methods are compared. In each table of this part, first we computed the misclassification error rate of feature extraction\u2019s output of one of the original UCI datasets. It is shown in second columns of each row. The feature reduction approaches which are used are SRDA [2], PCA [1] and REDA-SRDA [8]. After that, the DCG is applied on the input datasets. So, the feature reduction approaches are applied on their processed input datasets and next classified. Misclassification rates are shown in fourth columns. Also, Parameter \u03b1 is computed with a SGA (simple genetic algorithm) for each datasets and highlighted in third columns of each rows. All of the misclassification error rates computed with k-nearest neighborhood classifier [12] and we tried to use best number of k for each dataset to decrease the error rate. The results show, that the proposed approach increases the quality of feature reduction methods.

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper we presented a new concept call DCG to increase separability of classes. DCG is provided by subtracting features values of their labels.

Next we presented some ways to compute optimum numbers of DCG\u2019s loops and we mentioned some motivations for that. The results showed the quality of our idea based on various classifications. Some of advantages of proposed approach are:\n1) Suitability with near all of the classifiers based on processing stage 2) Noise insensitivity at the result of using labels 3) Low computational complexity against some of previous approaches 4) The accuracy rate results never be lower by using DCG than when original dataset are\nused"}, {"heading": "9.
