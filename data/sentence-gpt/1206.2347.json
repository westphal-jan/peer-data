This representation has a great practical interest due to the possibility to realize reasoning on classification with a fuzzy semantic network based system. For instance, the distinction between necessary, possible and user classes allows to take into account exceptions that may appear on fuzzy knowledge-base and facilitates integration of user's Objects in the base. This approach describes the theoretical aspects of the architecture of the whole experimental A.I. system we built in order to provide effective on-line assistance to users of new technological systems: the understanding of \"how it works\" and \"how to complete tasks\" from queries in quite natural languages. In our model, procedural semantic networks are used to describe the knowledge of an \"ideal\" expert while fuzzy sets are used both to describe the approximative and uncertain knowledge of novice users in fuzzy semantic networks which intervene to match fuzzy labels of a query with categories from our \"ideal\" expert. In a more intuitive way, this approach allows us to use the fuzzy semantics of the real-world \"ideal\" expert and thus to help users achieve the real-world \"ideal\" expert in a much more natural and highly complicated environment.\n\nThe above approach is related to the theory of the \"ideal\" expert, and its implications as well as its implications as an \"implicit\" expert. We present a theory of the \"ideal\" expert and the implications for learning how to use the fuzzy semantics of the real-world \"ideal\" expert. The abstract is here, as it appears, in the final version. The text of this article is in a more practical manner. In this way, the \"ideal\" expert is not limited to the definition of a \"deep learning model\" but also to \"implicit\" experts. As a concrete example, the first part of the following is in the first part of the second part of the third part of the fourth part of the third part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fifth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Jun 2012 20:51:51 GMT  (78kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2347v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1206.1794"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1206.1794", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mohamed nazih omri"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.2347"}, "pdf": {"name": "1206.2347.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Uncertain and Approximative Knowledge Representation to Reasoning on Classification with a Fuzzy Networks Based System", "authors": ["MOHAMED NAZIH Omri"], "emails": ["Nazih.Omri@ipeim.rnu.tn"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Assistant's diagnosis : \"as you are using a Text Editor you can only search for text files.

The Semantic Net of the \"Ideal Expert\"", "text": "Executing a procedure serves to reach a Goal on an Object. The underlying psychological hypothesis is these Goals are Object properties, and as such, are generators of Object categories. Goals and procedures define the function of Objects and the way to use them. As functional properties of Objects, they enter into the construction of semantic networks in the same way as structural properties. We define a procedure as a sequence of operations whose execution serves to reach a Goal, and where the elements of the sequence are either primitive actions or subGoals which themselves call for associated procedures. We define the \"Ideal\" Expert knowledge of a system as the knowledge that is sufficient to the system and that is described in a semantic network (figure 2).\nConstruction of the Ideal Expert Knowledge starts if given a set of Tasks that are executed using elements of one technical device through procedures. The first step is the task decomposition as a hierarchy of Goal decomposition into subGoals from the level of the Goal of the task to primitive actions. The second step consists in : i - drawing up a list of possible Goals and the procedures to reach these Goals, ii - constructing the Ideal Expert Net as a classical semantic network. But, instead of using structural properties of system's interface Objects, Goals reachable with those Objects are used as properties. The ideal user's description uses valid procedures that have to be applied to the elements of the device in order to successfully complete the task. Classes of Objects and relations between classes of Objects merge from routines for classification and routines for classes organization. The above principle may be derived from an algebraic entity: the Galois lattice of a binary relation (Barbut and Monjardet, 1970). Given a set of objects and a set of properties, we can built the binary relation composed by the set of all couples object-property for which the object holds the property. Such a binary relation may be presented a in two way table with objects in lines and properties in columns, checking cells structural properties of geometrical shapes are organised, we obtain the binary relation shown by the (figure 2), called the Hass diagram of the lattice. Several algorithms have been proposed to built the Galois lattice of a binary relation (Norris, 1978; Ganter, 1984; Bordat, 1986). This kind of lattices, and the Hasse diagram which is used to draw them, have severed to investigate categorization problems (Gu\u00e9noche & Van Mechelen, 1993; Storms, Van Mechelen & De Bocck, 1994). Figure (2) shows how the Galois lattice is used to formalize the class inclusion relation underlying data in table 1 by the mean of the double partial orders over: i - the set of objects, ii - the set of properties. The resulting structure is a two way lattices in which, when a set of objects A includes a set of objects B, the set of properties of the objects in A are included into the set of properties of the objects in B, and vice versa. The nodes of such a graph are called formal concepts by Wille (1982) because they clearly express the classical duality between the extension and the intension of concepts. In summary, a basic Ideal Expert Net (figure 1) is a hierarchy of abstract and concrete classes represented as a single directed graph [G: (N, G, R)] which is defined to consist of a set of nodes N (representing classes of Objects), a set of attributes G (representing Goals) and a set of relations R (representing classes inclusion) between nodes. Finally, the structural properties of Objects are added focusing on those that justify the application of the Procedures attached to the object in hand. Note that, by answering queries of the users while they try to perform a given goal, the Expert Assistant delivers not only planning information, but also a goal structure and the knowledge of what justifies the procedure by providing the knowledge that is included in the Ideal Expert Net. If the Assistance System does not understand the meaning of an instruction, it discusses with the user until it is able to interpret the query in its own language. With the learning of new words in natural language as the interpretation produced in agreement with the user, the system improves its representation scheme at each experiment with a new user and, in addition, takes advantage of previous discussions with users : i - the standard Objects and recognized by the software are described in a semantic network where goals stand for properties of Objects, ii - as the queries of an user are expressed in natural language and as they correspond more or less to these standard denominations, the system establishes fuzzy connections between its primary knowledge and the new labels of Objects or procedures expressed by the user. For instance, since a new attribute (new verb) can be identified with more than one primary attribute, we found convenient to use degrees of appropriateness of each such identification. For this purpose, we used the framework of fuzzy set theory and we describe fuzzy characterizations of classes of Objects with Goals as properties. Possibility and/or certainty measures enable us\nto quantify the opinion of users regarding the degree of similarity or convenience of associations between descriptions of both Objects and procedures. In the next section, we present the proposed system dealing with degrees of membership of an Object or a procedure formulated in the user's language to one of the classes of the fuzzy semantic network. It takes into account the degree of inclusion between fuzzy classes and the grade of membership of an instance to one or several classes. Rossazza (90) introduced the concept of fuzzy Objects and Dubois and Prade (1989) addressed the problem of typicality of class hierarchy, but very few works have been proposed in this direction, specially as a way of planning actions."}, {"heading": "3. The Fuzzy Semantic Net of Novice Users", "text": "However given the polysemic aspects of natural language (verbs and nouns which express goals and device objects), with the necessity of a man-machine interface that involve queries of users, the problem that is under investigation is how to match the content of a query (the label of an Object and the label of a Goal applied to this Object, as expressed by a novice user) to their corresponding items (class of Objects and Goals as properties) in the Ideal Expert Net.\nThe example of the technical system we consider here is a Word Processor software, with Objects such as \"chain-ofcharacters\", and procedures such as \"cut\" or \"copy\". For a novice user of the software, the list of standard denominations is not obvious and he often would like to ask an expert operator about how to execute an action such as \"how to rub letters\".\nTo describe common sense knowledge, different kinds of relationships must be used. They are necessary, sufficient and possible for Torasso and Console [Rossazza, 90], necessary and typical for Padgham [Padgham, 88]. At a theoretical level, the first organisation, as defined by Torasso and Console, appears to be powerful. However, it is difficult to define the sufficient linguistic value in practical applications and we do not use this concept [Tijus & Poitrenaud, 1992]. In our present work, we distinguish necessary properties from possible ones and we do not consider sufficient conditions. It follows that each Object or procedure is described by three fuzzy areas (necessary, possible and user areas), which describe the properties of the attributes A."}, {"heading": "3.1. Fuzzy areas", "text": "Necessary area : The necessary area Z N (P, A) of a linguistic value P of an attribute A is the set of couples (necessary linguistic value, necessity degree) admissible for A relatively to P. This area is fuzzy because some values are less admissible than others.

The latter is given by one expert using EraseWithMenu, EraseWithKey and CutWithMenu to design the system linguistic value Erase.\nPossible area: The possible area Z P (P, A) of a linguistic value P of an attribute A is the set of couples (possible linguistic value, possibility degree) admissible for A relatively to P. This area is also obtained from a possibility distribution given by a system expert.

This set is obtained from the user reasoning. The necessary, the possible and the user areas allow to define attributes of Objects classes."}, {"heading": "3.2.

The first one is a set of fuzzy areas and the second one is a set of couples (linguistic possible value, possibility degree). They are shown as follows:\nA : A 1 Z 1 U ( ) . . . A n Z n U ( ) [ ]\n( )2\nWhere A i are user's linguistic variables of the attribute A,\nZ i U the user's area fuzzy values.\nFor a couple (possible linguistic value, associate degree), this structure becomes:\nA :[ A 1 p 11, d 11( ) , . . . , p 1 k , d 1 k ( ) { } , . . . , A n p n 1 , d n 1 ( ) , . . . , p n l , d n l( ) { } ] ( )3\nWhere A i linguistic variables associated with A,\nP ik possible linguistic variables associated with A i . d ik possible linguistic variables associated with P ik . The definition of the user's attribute is as follows: Definition 1: Let P i , i \u2208 [1, n], a set of user's linguistic variables. We define a user's attribute A U by:\nA U = Z U P 1 ( ) \u00d7 Z U P 2 ( ) \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Z U P n ( ) ( )4\nExample 5 : attribute: procedure domain : [EraseWithMenu, EraseWithKey, Select, CutWithMenu] value : Gum User's area.: [(EraseWithMenu, 1) (EraseWithKey, 0.7) (CutWithMenu, 0.5)]\nThree kinds of attributes can therefore be define for the object O: necessary attribute A N , possible attribute A P and user attribute A U . These attributes are fuzzy as results of the Cartesian products of fuzzy areas. The set of attributes describes classes and instances. Properties of A U are user properties which can't be used in the theoretical definition of classes and instances. Definition 2 : Let A i , i \u2208 [1, n] be a set of attributes. We define class C as:\nC = A 1 \u00d7 A 2 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 A n ( )5 Definition 3 : Leta i , i \u2208 [1, n] be a set of attributes A i , i \u2208 [1, n].

Given a set of objects and a set of properties, we can built the binary relation composed by the set of all couples object-property for which the object holds the property. Such a binary relation may be presented a in two way table with objects in lines and properties in columns, checking cells structural properties of geometrical shapes are organised, we obtain the binary relation shown by the (figure 2), called the Hass diagram of the lattice. Several algorithms have been proposed to built the Galois lattice of a binary relation (Norris, 1978; Ganter, 1984; Bordat, 1986). This kind of lattices, and the Hasse diagram which is used to draw them, have severed to investigate categorization problems (Gu\u00e9noche & Van Mechelen, 1993; Storms, Van Mechelen & De Bocck, 1994). Figure (2) shows how the Galois lattice is used to formalize the class inclusion relation underlying data in table 1 by the mean of the double partial orders over: i - the set of objects, ii - the set of properties. The resulting structure is a two way lattices in which, when a set of objects A includes a set of objects B, the set of properties of the objects in A are included into the set of properties of the objects in B, and vice versa.

This approach describes the theoretical aspects of the architecture of the whole experimental A.I. system we built in order to provide effective on-line assistance to users of new technological systems: the understanding of \"how it works\" and \"how to complete tasks\" from queries in quite natural languages. In our model, procedural semantic networks are used to describe the knowledge of an \"ideal\" expert while fuzzy sets are used both to describe the approximative and uncertain knowledge of novice users in fuzzy semantic networks which intervene to match fuzzy labels of a query with categories from our \"ideal\" expert.", "creator": "PDFCreator Version 1.0.2"}}}
