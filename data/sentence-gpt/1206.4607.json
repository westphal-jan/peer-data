Introduction", "text": "Trees are fundamental data structures used to represent very different objects such as proteins, HTML documents, or interpretations of natural language utterances. Thus, many areas \u2013 for example, biology (Vert, 2002; Hashimoto et al., 2008), computer security (Du\u0308ssel et al., 2008), and natural language processing (Collins & Duffy, 2001; Gildea & Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2005; MacCartney et al., 2006) \u2013 fostered extensive research in methods for learning classifiers that leverage on these data structures.\nTree kernels (TK), firstly introduced in (Collins & Duffy, 2001) as specific convolution kernels (Haussler, 1999), are widely used to fully exploit tree structured data when learning classifiers. Different tree kernels modeling different feature spaces have been proposed (see (Shin et al., 2011) for a survey), but a primary research focus is the reduction of their execution time. Kernel machines compute many times TK functions during learning and classification. The original tree kernel algorithm (Collins & Duffy, 2001), that relies on dynamic programming techniques, has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the size of input trees. Execution time and space occupation are still affordable for parse trees of natural language sen-\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012.

But these tree kernels hardly scale to large training and application sets.\nAs worst-case complexity of TKs is hard to improve, the biggest effort has been devoted in controlling the average execution time of TK algorithms. Three directions have been mainly explored. The first direction is the exploitation of some specific characteristics of trees. For example, it is possible to demonstrate that the execution time of the original algorithm becomes linear in average for parse trees of natural language sentences (Moschitti, 2006). Yet, the tree kernel has still to be computed over the full underlying feature space and the space occupation is still quadratic. The second explored direction is the reduction of the underlying feature space of tree fragments to control the execution time by approximating the kernel function. The feature selection is done in the learning phase. Then, for the classification, either the selection is directly encoded in the kernel computation by selecting subtrees headed by specific node labels (Rieck et al., 2010) or the smaller selected space is made explicit (Pighin & Moschitti, 2010). In these cases, the beneficial effect is only during the classification and learning is overloaded with feature selection. The third direction exploits dynamic programming on the whole training and application sets of instances (Shin et al., 2011). Kernel functions are reformulated to be computed using partial kernel computations done for other pairs of trees. As any dynamic programming technique, this approach is transferring time complexity in space complexity.\nIn this paper, we propose the distributed tree kernels (DTK) (introduced in (Zanzotto & Dell\u2019Arciprete, 2011)) as a novel method to reduce time and space complexity of tree kernels. The idea is to embed feature spaces of tree fragments in low-dimensional spaces, where the computation is approximated but its worst-case complexity is linear with respect to the dimension of the space. As a direct embedding is impractical, we propose a recursive algorithm with linear complexity to compute reduced vectors for trees in the low-dimensional space. We formally show that the dot product among reduced vectors approximates the original\ntree kernel when a vector composition function with specific ideal properties is used. We then propose two approximations of the ideal vector composition function and we study their properties. Finally, we empirically investigate the execution time of DTKs and how well these new kernels approximate original tree kernels. We show that DTKs are faster, correlate with tree kernels, and obtain a statistically similar performance in two natural language processing tasks.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the notation, the basic idea, and the expected properties for DTKs. Section 3 introduces the DTKs and proves their properties. Section 4 compares the complexity of DTKs with other tree kernels. Section 5 empirically investigates these new kernel algorithms. Finally, section 6 draws some conclusions."}, {"heading": "2. Challenges for Distributed Tree Kernels", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1. Notation and Basic Idea", "text": "Tree kernels (TK) (Collins & Duffy, 2001) have been proposed as efficient methods to implicitly compute dot products in feature spaces Rm of tree fragments. A direct computation in these high-dimensional spaces is impractical. Given two trees, T1 and T2 in T, tree kernels TK(T1, T2) perform weighted counts of the common subtrees \u03c4 . By construction, these counts are the dot products of the vectors representing the trees, ~T1 and ~T2 in Rm, i.e.:\nTK(T1, T2) = ~T1 \u00b7 ~T2 (1)\nVectors ~T encode trees T as forests of active tree fragments F(T ). Each dimension ~\u03c4i of Rm corresponds to a tree fragment \u03c4i. The trivial weighting scheme assigns \u03c9i = 1 to dimension ~\u03c4i if tree fragment \u03c4i is a subtree of the original tree T and \u03c9i = 0 otherwise. Different weighting schemes are possible and used. Function I, that maps trees in T to vectors in Rm, is:\n~T = I(T ) = m\u2211 i=1 \u03c9iI(\u03c4i) = m\u2211 i=1 \u03c9i~\u03c4i (2)\nwhere I maps tree fragments into related vectors of the standard orthogonal basis of Rm, i.e., ~\u03c4i = I(\u03c4i).\nTo reduce computational complexity of tree kernels, we want to explore the possibility of embedding vectors ~T \u2208 Rm into smaller vectors ;\nT \u2208 Rd, with d m, to allow for an approximated but faster and explicit computation of these kernel functions. The direct embedding f : Rm \u2192 Rd is, in principle, possible with techniques like singular value decomposition or random indexing (Sahlgren, 2005), but it is again impractical due to the huge dimension of Rm.\nThen, our basic idea is to look for a function F\u0302 : T \u2192 Rd that directly maps trees T into small vectors ;\nT . We call these latter distributed trees (DT) in line with Distributed Representations (Hinton et al., 1986). The computation of similarity over distributed trees is the distributed tree kernel (DTK):\nDTK(T1, T2) , ; T1 \u00b7 ; T2 = F\u0302 (T1) \u00b7 F\u0302 (T2) (3)\nAs the two distributed trees are in the low dimensional space Rd, the dot product computation, having constant complexity, is extremely efficient. Computation of function F\u0302 is more expensive than the actual DTK, but it is done once for each tree and outside of the learning algorithms. We also propose a recursive algorithm with linear complexity to perform this computation."}, {"heading": "2.2. Distributed Trees, Distributed Tree Fragments, and Expected Properties", "text": "Distributed tree kernels are faster than tree kernels. We here examine the properties required of F\u0302 so that DTKs are also approximated computations of TKs, i.e.:\nDTK(T1, T2) \u2248 TK(T1, T2) (4)\nTo derive these properties and describe function F\u0302 , we show the relations between the traditional function I : T\u2192 Rm that maps trees into forests of tree fragments, in the tree fragments feature space, I : T \u2192 Rm that maps tree fragments into the standard orthogonal basis of Rm, the linear embedding function f : Rm \u2192 Rd that maps ~T into a smaller vector ;\nT = f(~T ), and our newly defined function F\u0302 .\nEquation 2 presents vectors ~T with respect to the standard orthonormal basis E = {~e1 . . . ~em} = {~\u03c41 . . . ~\u03c4m} of Rm. Then, according to this reading, we can rewrite the distributed tree ;\nT \u2208 Rd as: ; T = f(~T ) = f( \u2211 i \u03c9i~\u03c4i) = \u2211 i \u03c9if(~\u03c4i) = \u2211 i \u03c9i ; \u03c4 i\nwhere each ; \u03c4 i represents tree fragment \u03c4i in the new space. The linear function f works as a sort of approximated basis transformation, mapping vectors ~\u03c4 of the standard basis E into approximated vectors ; \u03c4 that should represent them. As ; \u03c4i represents a single tree fragment \u03c4i, we call it a distributed tree fragment (DTF). The set of vectors E\u0303 = {;\u03c4 1 . . . ; \u03c4 m} should be the approximated orthonormal basis of Rm embedded in Rd . Then, these two properties should hold:\nProperty 1 (Nearly Unit Vectors) A distributed tree fragment ; \u03c4 representing a tree fragment \u03c4 is a nearly unit vector: 1\u2212 < ||;\u03c4 || < 1 +\nProperty 2 (Nearly Orthogonal Vectors) Given two different tree fragments \u03c41 and \u03c42, their distributed vectors are nearly orthogonal: if \u03c41 6= \u03c42, then | ; \u03c41 \u00b7 ; \u03c42| <\nAs vectors ; \u03c4 \u2208 E\u0303 represent the basic tree fragments \u03c4 , the idea is that ; \u03c4 can be obtained directly from tree fragment\n\u03c4 by means of a function f\u0302(\u03c4) = f(I(\u03c4)) that composes f and I . Using this function to obtain distributed tree fragments ; \u03c4 , distributed trees ;\nT can be obtained as follows: ; T = F\u0302 (T ) = \u2211\n\u03c4i\u2208F(T )\n\u03c9if\u0302(\u03c4i) (5)\nThis latter equation is presented with respect to the active tree fragments forest F(T ) of T , neglecting vectors where \u03c9i = 0. It is easy to show that, if properties 1 and 2 hold for function f\u0302 , distributed tree kernels approximate tree kernels (see Equation 4)."}, {"heading": "3.

This relation affects how well DTKs approximate TKs (Equation 4).\nKnowing that f exists, we are presented with the following issues:\n\u2022 building a function f\u0302 that directly computes the distributed tree fragment ; \u03c4 i from tree fragment \u03c4i (Sec.\n3.2);\n\u2022 showing that distributed trees ;\nT = F\u0302 (T ) can be computed efficiently (Sec. 3.1).\nOnce the above issues are solved, we need to empirically show that Equation (4) is satisfied and that computing DTKs is more efficient than computing TKs. These latter points are discussed in the experimental section."}, {"heading": "3.1.

Each node n is mapped to a vector ; n \u2208 N . To ensure that these basic vectors are statistically nearly orthonormal, their elements ( ; n)i are randomly drawn from a normal distribution N(0, 1) and they are normalized so that ||;n || = 1 (cf. the demonstration of Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma in (Dasgupta & Gupta, 1999)). Actual node vectors depend on the node labels, so that ; n1 = ; n2 if L(n1) = L(n2), where L(\u00b7) is the node label.\nTree structure can be univocally represented in a \u2018flat\u2019 format using a parenthetical notation. For example, the tree in Fig. 1 is represented by the sequence (A (B W1)(C (D W2)(E W3))). This notation corresponds to a depth-first visit of the tree, augmented with parentheses so that the tree structure is determined as well.\nReplacing the nodes with their corresponding vectors and introducing a vector composition function : Rd \u00d7 Rd \u2192 Rd, the above formulation can be seen as a mathematical expression that defines a representative vector for a whole tree.

We discussed basic features of these kernels in the introduction.\nTable 4 reports time and space complexity of the kernels in learning and in classification. DTK is clearly competitive with respect to other methods, since both complexities are constant, according to the size d of the reduced feature space. In these two phases, kernels are applied many times by the learning algorithms. Then, a constant complexity is extremely important. Clearly, there is a trade-off between the chosen d and the average size of trees n. A comparison among execution times is done applying these algorithms to actual trees (see Section 5.3)."}, {"heading": "5.
