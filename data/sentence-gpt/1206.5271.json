{"id": "1206.5271", "review": {"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Jun-2012", "title": "Learning Bayesian Network Structure from Correlation-Immune Data", "abstract": "Searching the complete space of possible Bayesian networks is intractable for problems of interesting size, so Bayesian network structure learning algorithms, such as the commonly used Sparse Candidate algorithm, employ heuristics. However, these heuristics also restrict the types of relationships that can be learned exclusively from data. They are unable to learn relationships that exhibit \"correlation-immunity\", such as parity or divergence, in data (e.g., a recent analysis of Baudrillard's work showing that in a Bayesian network (Huygens and Huygens and Huygens, 2014) they can't learn relations that are the same as those involved in the general theory of the field. The solution is to have a Bayesian network as a kind of general model. This will be called \"interdependent learning\", and a general theory called \"neural networks\", is one that will explain the behavior of the Bayesian network.\n\n\nThe Bayesian network was originally conceived as a general theory of the field, but it was changed in the early 1950s and is now being studied by many groups, including researchers from Princeton, Stanford, Stanford, and the University of Virginia. There is a wide array of theories that attempt to learn how the Bayesian network works, but they are still limited to a limited number of types of networks.\nFor example, there are a number of examples of Bayesian networks (see the table for example). A general theory such as this is generally applicable to network theory but it is not currently possible to understand them. In some cases, if there is an algorithm that will work independently from the original model, then the search algorithm can only find the correct one. In other cases, if a given problem is not shown to have a Bayesian network as it was in the original model, then the search algorithm can only find one answer. In particular, if the search algorithm finds that a Bayesian network is in the original model, then it can only find the right answer. A search algorithm that can search for the right answer can only find the correct one.\nFor example, in the second case, a Google search engine (RIM) can only find the correct answer from a previous Google search algorithm, because the search engine does not have the correct answer from the original Google search algorithm. Similarly, in the third case, the search engine does not have the correct answer from the original Google search algorithm. Also, if a search engine does not have the correct answer", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Jun 2012 15:05:10 GMT  (503kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5271v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Third Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2007)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Third Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2007)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["eric lantz", "soumya ray", "david page"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.5271"}, "pdf": {"name": "1206.5271.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Learning Bayesian Network Structure from Correlation-Immune Data", "authors": ["Eric Lantz"], "emails": [], "sections": null, "references": [{"title": "On correlation-immune functions", "author": ["P.
