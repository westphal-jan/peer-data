Introduction", "text": "Covariance estimation is a classical problem in multivariate statistics. The idea that second-order statistics capture important and relevant relationships between a given set of variables is natural. Finding the sample covariance matrix based on observed data is straightforward and widely used (Anderson, 1984). However, the sample covariance matrix is ill-behaved in highdimensions, where the number of dimensions p is typically much larger than the number of available samples n (p n). Here, the problem of covariance estimation is ill-posed since the number of unknown parameters is larger than the number of available samples, and the sample covariance matrix becomes singular in this regime.\nVarious solutions have been proposed for highdimensional covariance estimation. Intuitively, by restricting the class of covariance models to those with a limited number of free parameters, we can successfully estimate the models in high dimensions. A natural mechanism to achieve this is to impose a sparsity constraint on the covariance matrix, which implies that the variables under consideration satisfy marginal independence, corresponding to the zero pattern of the covariance matrix (Kauermann, 1996) (and we refer to such models as independence models). In many settings, however, marginal independence is too restrictive and does not hold. For instance, consider the dependence between the monthly stock returns of various companies listed on the S&P 100 index. It is quite possible that a wide range of complex (and unobserved) factors such as the economic climate, interest rates etc., affect the returns of all the companies. Thus, it is not realistic to model the stock returns of various companies through a sparse covariance model.\nA popular alternative sparse model, based on conditional independence relationships, has gained\nwidespread acceptance in recent years (Lauritzen, 1996). In this case, sparsity is imposed not on the covariance matrix, but on the inverse covariance or the precision matrix. It can be shown that the zero pattern of the precision matrix corresponds to a set of conditional-independence relationships and such models are referred to as graphical or Markov models. Going back to the stock market example, a first-order approximation is to model the companies in different divisions1 as conditionally independent given the S&P 100 index variable, which captures the overall trends of the stock returns, and thus removes much of the dependence between the companies in different divisions. However, sparse Markov models may not be always sufficient to capture all the relationships between the variables. Going back to the stock market example, the approximation of using the S&P index node to capture the dependence between companies of different divisions may not be enough. For instance, there can still be a large residual dependence between the companies in manufacturing and mining divisions, which cannot be accounted by the S&P index node.\nIn this paper, we make the above notion precise, and model the variables as a linear combination of samples from an independence and a Markov model. In other words, the covariance matrix of the resulting model is a linear combination of a sparse covariance and a sparse precision matrix, see Fig.1. This forms a richer class of models which can faithfully capture complex relationships, such as in the stock market example above, and yet retain parsimony in the representation.\nSummary of Contributions\nWe consider joint estimation of Markov and independence models, given observed data in a high dimensional setting. Our contributions in this paper are three fold. First, we derive a set of sufficient restrictions, under which there is a unique decomposition into the two domains, viz., the Markov and the independence domains, thereby leading to an identifiable\n1 See http://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic_manual.html for classifi-\ncations of the companies.\nmodel. Second, we propose novel and efficient estimators for obtaining the decomposition, under both exact and sample statistics. Third, we provide strong theoretical guarantees for high-dimensional learning, both in terms of norm guarantees and sparsistency in each domain, viz., the Markov and the independence domain.\nOur learning method is based on convex optimization. We adapt the popular `1-penalized maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), proposed originally for sparse Markovmodel selection. This estimator is widely used, and theoretical guarantees on consistent estimation have been proven. Here, an `1 penalty is imposed on the precision matrix, which is a convex relaxation of the `0 penalty, in order to encourage sparsity in the precision matrix. It is well known that the Lagrangian dual of this program is a maximum entropy solution which approximately fits the given sample covariance matrix. We modify this program to our setting as follows: we incorporate an additional `1 penalty term involving the residual covariance matrix (corresponding to the independence model) in the max-entropy program. This term can be viewed as encouraging sparsity in the independence domain, while fitting a maximum entropy Markov model to the rest of the sample correlations (after incorporating the independence model). We characterize the optimal solution of the above program, and also provide intuitions on the class of Markov and independence model combinations which can be incorporated under this framework. As a byproduct of this analysis, we obtain a set of conditions for identifiability of the two model components.\nWe provide strong theoretical guarantees for our proposed method under a set of sufficient conditions. We establish that it is possible to obtain sparsistency and norm guarantees in both the Markov and the independence domains, which is somewhat surprising. We establish that the number of samples n is required to scale as n = \u2126(d2 log p) for consistency, where p is the number of variables, and d is the maximum degree in the Markov graph. The set of sufficient conditions for successful recovery are based on the so-called notion of mutual incoherence, which controls the dependence between different sets of variables, See (Ravikumar et al., 2011). Our conditions are similar to those previously characterized for consistent graphical model selection, and are only slightly stronger. Our consistency proofs borrow ideas from (Ravikumar et al., 2011), and at the same time, require new ideas to carefully control the errors in the two domains, viz., the Markov and the independence domains. This is because the proposed optimization method only ensures that the overall combination of the Markov and the independence\nmodels is close to the sample covariance matrix, and does not limit the individual perturbations in the two domains. We consider a careful partitioning of the variables, and impose a set of mutual incoherence conditions, and provide consistency guarantees in high dimensions.\nThe idea that a combination of Markov and independence models can provide good model-fitting is not by itself new, see (Choi et al., 2010). However, the previous approach has several deficiencies, including lack of theoretical guarantees, assumption of a known sparsity support for the Markov model, use of expectation maximization (EM) which has convergence issues, and so on. In contrast, we develop convex optimization methods for decomposition , and also provide theoretical guarantees for successful recovery. In summary, in this paper, we provide an in-depth study of efficient methods and guarantees for joint estimation of a combination of Markov and independence models.\nOur experiments validate our theoretical results and demonstrate that our method is able to learn a richer class of models, compared to sparse graphical model selection, while requiring similar number of samples. In particular, our method is able to provide better estimates for the overall precision matrix, which is dense in general, while the performance of `1-based optimization is worse since it attempts to approximate the dense matrix via a sparse estimate. Additionally, we demonstrate that our estimated models have better accuracy under simple distributed inference algorithms such as loopy belief propagation (LBP). This is because the Markov components of the estimated models tend to be more walk summable (Malioutov et al., 2006), since some of the correlations can be \u201ctransferred\u201d to the residual matrix. Thus, in addition to learning a richer model class, incorporating sparsity in both covariance and precision domains, we also learn models amenable to efficient inference."}, {"heading": "2.

Gaussian Graphical Models", "text": "A Gaussian graphical model is a family of jointly Gaussian distributions which factor in accordance to a given graph. Given a graph G = (V,E), with V = {1, . . . , p}, consider a vector of Gaussian random variables X = [X1, X2, . . . , Xp], where each node i \u2208 V is associated with a scalar Gaussian random variable Xi. A Gaussian graphical model Markov on G has a probability density function (pdf) that may be parameterized as fX(x) \u221d exp [ \u2212 12x T Jx+ hTx ] , where J is a positive-definite symmetric matrix whose sparsity pattern corresponds to that of the graph G. More precisely, J(i, j) = 0 iff (i, j) /\u2208 G. The matrix J is known as the potential or concentration matrix, the non-zero entries J(i, j) as the edge potentials, and the vector h as the potential vector. This parameterization is known as the information form and is related to the standard mean-covariance parameterization of the Gaussian as \u00b5 = J\u22121h, \u03a3 = J\u22121, where \u00b5 := E[X] is the mean vector and \u03a3 := E[(X \u2212 \u00b5)(X \u2212 \u00b5)T ] is the covariance matrix.\nWe say that a jointly Gaussian random vector X with joint pdf f(x) satisfies local Markov property with respect to a graph G if f(xi|xN (i)) = f(xi|xV \\i) holds for all nodes i \u2208 V , where N (i) denotes the set of neighbors of node i \u2208 V and, V \\ i denotes the set of all nodes excluding i.

Problem Statement", "text": "We now give a detailed description of our problem statement, which consists of the covariance decomposition problem (given exact statistics) and covariance estimation problem (given a set of samples).\nCovariance Decomposition Problem: A fundamental question to be addressed is the identifiability of the model parameters.\nDefinition 1 (Identifiability). A parametric model {P\u03b8 : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} is identifiable with respect to a measure \u00b5 if there do not exist two distinct parameters \u03b81 6= \u03b82 such that P\u03b81 = P\u03b82 almost everywhere w.r.t. to \u00b5.\nThus, if a model is not identifiable, there is no hope of estimating the model parameters from observed data. A Gaussian graphical model (with no hidden variables) belongs to the family of standard exponential distributions (Wainwright & Jordan, 2008). Under nondegeneracy conditions, it is also in the minimal form, and as such is identifiable (Brown, 1986). In our setting in (2), however, identifiability is not straightforward to address, and forms an important part of the covariance decomposition problem, described below.\nDecomposition Problem: Given the covariance matrix \u03a3\u2217 = J\u2217M \u22121 + \u03a3\u2217R as in (2), where J \u2217 M is an unknown concentration matrix and \u03a3\u2217R is an unknown residual covariance matrix, how and under what conditions can we uniquely recover J\u2217M and \u03a3 \u2217 R from \u03a3 \u2217?\nIn other words, we want to address whether the matrices J\u2217M and \u03a3 \u2217 R are identifiable, given \u03a3\n\u2217, and if so, how can we design efficient methods to recover them. If we do not impose any additional restrictions, there exists an equivalence class of models which form solutions to the decomposition problem. For instance, we can model \u03a3\u2217 entirely through an independence model (\u03a3\u2217 = \u03a3\u2217R), or through a Markov model (\u03a3 \u2217 = J\u2217M \u22121). However, in most scenarios, these extreme cases are not desirable, since they result in dense models, while we are interested in sparse representations with a parsimonious use of edges in both the graphs, viz., the Markov and the independence graphs. In Section 3.1, we provide a sufficient set of structural and parametric conditions to guarantee identifiability of the Markov and the independence components, and in Section 3.2, we propose an optimization program to obtain them.\nCovariance Estimation Problem: In the above decomposition problem, we assume that the exact covariance matrix \u03a3\u2217 is known. However, in practice, we only have access to samples, and we describe this setting below.\nDenote \u03a3\u0302n as the sample covariance matrix \u03a3\u0302n :=\n1 n \u2211n k=1 x(k)x T (k),where x(k), k = 1, ..., n are n i.i.d. observations of a zero mean Gaussian random vector X \u223c N (0,\u03a3\u2217), where X := (X1, ..., Xp). Now the estimation problem is described below.\nEstimation Problem: Assume that there exists a unique decomposition \u03a3\u2217 = J\u2217M \u22121 + \u03a3\u2217R where J \u2217 M is an unknown concentration matrix with bounded entries and \u03a3\u2217R is an unknown sparse residual covariance matrix given a set of constraints. Given the sample covariance matrix \u03a3\u0302n, our goal is to find estimates of J\u2217M and \u03a3 \u2217 R with provable guarantees.\nIn the sequel, we relate the exact and the sample versions of the decomposition problem. In Section 4, we propose a modified optimization program to obtain efficient estimates of the Markov and independence components. Under a set of sufficient conditions, we provide guarantees in terms of sparsistency, sign consistency, and norm guarantees, defined below.\nDefinition 2 (Estimation Guarantees). We say that\nan estimate (J\u0302M , \u03a3\u0302R) to the decomposition problem in (2), given a sample covariance matrix \u03a3\u0302 n , is sparsis-\ntent or model consistent, if the supports of J\u0302M and \u03a3\u0302R coincide with the supports of J\u2217M and \u03a3 \u2217 R respectively. It is said to be sign consistent, if additionally, the respective signs coincide. The norm guarantees on the estimates is in terms of bounds on \u2016J\u0302M \u2212 J\u2217M\u2016 and \u2016\u03a3\u0302R \u2212\u03a3 \u2217 R\u2016, under some norm \u2016\u00b7\u2016."}, {"heading": "3.

Similarly, the primal program in (7) has an additional `1 penalty term on J\u0302M , which is absent in (6).

Assumptions under Sample Statistics", "text": "The additional assumptions for successful recovery in high dimensions are based on the Hessian of the objective function in the optimization program in (7), with respect to the variable JM , evaluated at the true Markov model J\u2217M . The Hessian of this function is given by (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004)\n\u0393\u2217 = J\u2217M \u22121 \u2297 J\u2217M \u22121 = \u03a3\u2217M \u2297 \u03a3 \u2217 M , (10)\nwhere \u2297 denotes the Kronecker matrix product. Thus \u0393\u2217 is a p2\u00d7p2 matrix indexed by the node pairs. Based on the results for exponential families (Brown, 1986), \u0393\u2217(i,j),(k,l) = Cov{XiXj , XkXl}, and hence it can be interpreted as an edge-based alternative to the usual covariance matrix \u03a3\u2217M . Define KM as the `\u221e operator norm of the covariance matrix of the Markov model: KM := |||\u03a3\u2217M |||\u221e. We now denote the supports of the Markov and residual models. Denote EM := {(i, j) \u2208 V \u00d7 V |i 6= j, ( J\u2217M ) ij 6= 0} as the edge set of Markov matrix J\u2217M .

(12)\nThus, the set SM includes diagonal entries and also all edges of the Markov graph corresponding to J\u2217M . Also, recall from (A.2) that the diagonal entries of \u03a3\u2217R are set to zero, and that the support set SR is contained in SM , i.e., SR \u2282 SM . Let ScM and S c R denote the respective complement sets. Define S := SM \u2229 ScR, so that {SR, S, ScM} forms a partition of {(1, ..., p)\u00d7(1, ..., p)}. This partitioning plays a crucial role in being able to provide learning guarantees. Define the maximum node degree for Markov model J\u2217M as\nd := max j=1,...,p |{i : (i, j) \u2208 EM}|.

Consider a Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix \u03a3\u2217 = J\u2217M\n\u22121 + \u03a3\u2217R satisfying conditions (A.0)-(A.5).

In fact, the result is non-asymptotic which is provided in the extended version on arXiv.\nRemark 2 (Comparison with sparse graphical model selection): The high dimensional covariance estimation problem which is investigated in (Ravikumar et al., 2011) involves similar mutual incoherence conditions and gives similar consistency results. Regarding the final result, sample complexity and convergence rate of estimated models are exactly the same as results in (Ravikumar et al., 2011) with only some minor differences in coefficients. But regarding the incoherence conditions, since their program is a special case of ours, the required conditions are less restrictive in their case. It is natural that we need some more incoherence conditions in order to be able to recover both the Markov and residual models."}, {"heading": "5. Experiments", "text": "In this section we provide experimental results for the proposed algorithm. We term our proposed optimization program as `1 + `\u221e method and compare it with the well-known `1 method which is a special case of the proposed algorithm when \u03bb = \u221e. The optimization programs are implemented by YALMIP (Lofberg, 2004) and SDPT3 (Toh et al., 1999) packages for MATLAB. We also compare the performance of applying belief propagation to exact models.\nSynthetic Data: We build a Markov + residual synthetic model in the following way. The underlying graph for the Markov part is an 8 \u00d7 8 2-D grid structure (4-nearest neighbor grid). We choose the offdiagonal nonzero entries in J\u2217M (corresponding to the grid edges) randomly from set {\u22120.5, 0.5}. Then we ensure that J\u2217M is positive definite by adding some uniform diagonal weighting. We choose 0.2 fraction of Markov edges randomly to introduce residual edges. The value of these nonzero entries in \u03a3\u2217R are chosen from {\u22120.2, 0.2} such that the sign of residual entry is opposite of the sign of overlapping Markov entry (assumption (A.3)). We also generate a random mean in the interval [0, 1] for each node.\nWe apply `1+`\u221e and `1 methods to a random realiza-\ntion of the above described model \u03a3\u2217 = J\u2217M \u22121 + \u03a3\u2217R. The edit distance between estimated and exact Markov model J\u0302M and J \u2217 M is plotted in figure 2.a for different number of samples. First observation is that by increasing the number of samples, the edit distance decreases which is consistent with theoretical results. We also see that the behaviour of `1 + `\u221e method is very close to `1 method which suggests that sparsity pattern of J\u2217M can be estimated efficiently under either methods. The edit distance between \u03a3\u0302R and \u03a3\u2217R is plotted in figure 2.b. We see again decreasing trend for `1 + `\u221e method here with increasing number of samples. But since there is not any off-diagonal `\u221e constraints in `1 method, it can not recover the residual matrix \u03a3\u2217R. Finally the `\u221e-elementwise norm of error between estimated precision matrix J\u0302 and the exact precision matrix J\u2217 is sketched for both methods in figure 2.c. We observe the advantage of proposed `1 + `\u221e method in estimating the overall model precision matrix J\u2217 = \u03a3\u2217\u22121.\nNext the results of running Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) on the models are presented. We compare the result of applying LBP to the same J\u2217 and J\u2217M models generated in the learning discussion above. The log of average mean and variance errors over all nodes are sketched in figure 3 throughout the iterations. We observe that LBP does not converge for J\u2217 model. It is shown by Malioutov et al. (2006) that if a model is walk-summable then the mean estimates under LBP converge and are accurate. The spectral norms of the partial correlation matrices are \u2016RM\u2016 = 0.9443 and \u2016R\u2016 = 6.9191 for J\u2217M and J\n\u2217 models respectively. Thus, the matrix J\u2217 is not walk-summable and therefore its convergence under LBP is not guaranteed and this is seen in figure 3. On the other hand, LBP is accurate for J\u2217M matrix. Thus, our method learns models which are better suited for inference under loopy belief propagation."}, {"heading": "6. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we provided an in-depth study of convex optimization methods and guarantees for high-dimensional covariance decomposition into sparse Markov and independence domains. We provide consistency guarantees for estimation in both the Markov and the independence domains, and establish efficient sample complexity results for our method. These findings open up many future directions to explore. One important aspect is to relax the sparsity constraints imposed in the two domains, and to develop new methods to enable decomposition of such models. Other considerations include extension to discrete models\nand other models for the residual covariance matrix (e.g. low rank matrices). Such findings will push the envelope of efficient models for high-dimensional estimation. It is worth mentioning while in many scenarios it is important to incorporate latent variables, in our framework it is challenging to incorporate both latent variables as well as marginal independencies, and provide learning guarantees, and we defer it to future work."}], "references": [{"title": "An Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis", "author": ["T.W.
