They can be adapted to variables observed in discrete or discretized time, like e.g. time series or dynamic Bayesian networks. This does not, however, capture the intuitive notion of dynamic dependence between processes, which is asymmetric, and we therefore propose an alternative.\nPut informally, we are interested in the following kind of dynamic (conditional) independencies among stochastic processes X(t), Y (t) and Z(t):\npresent of X\u22a5\u22a5past of Y | past of (X, Z),\nwhich will be denoted by Y \u2192/ X|Z, or more formally\nX(t)\u22a5\u22a5FYt\u2212 | FX,Zt\u2212 ,\nwhere Ft\u2212 is the history of a process. Such independence underlies the notion of Granger non\u2013causality for time series (Granger, 1969), which has been used as the basis for a graphical representation by Eichler (2002). It also underlies the continuous\u2013time notion of local independence given by Schweder (1970) for Markov processes, and its bivariate version for general continuous\u2013time processes by Aalen (1987) with a multivariate version in Didelez (2000, pp.65). A special case of Schweder\u2019s concept are the dependencies represented in the continuous time Bayesian networks developed by Nodelman et al. (2002) for homogenous Markov processes. Cyclic graphs have also been proposed to represent non\u2013recursive structural equation models or feedback processes (Sprites, 1995; Pearl and Dechter, 1996), but with the above notion of dependence between past and present we explicitly consider processes instead of cross sectional measurements of variables in equilibrium.\nConsider the following example illustrating the idea of local dependence and its graphical representation. In some countries programs exist to assist the elderly, e.g. through regular visits by nurses. Assume that these visits reduce the frequency of hospitalizations but do not in any other way affect future survival (this could be the null hypothesis). Assume further that the frequency of visits is intensified when a person has previously been hospitalized. Also assume that the general health status affects the rate of future hospitalization and the survival but not the frequency of future visits. The proposed graphical representation of these assumptions is given in Figure 1.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. We first review, in Section 2, the notion of local independence for Markov processes and its generalization to multi\u2013 state processes. A graphical representation as well as a suitable asymmetric separation are proposed in Section 3. The properties of local independence and the corresponding graphical representation are investigated in Section 4 within the framework of asymmetric graphoids."}, {"heading": "2 LOCAL INDEPENDENCE", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 MARKOV PROCESSES", "text": "We consider a first order Markov process Y(t), t \u2208 T , with a finite state space S and with transition intensities \u03b1qr(t), q 6= r \u2208 S, which are assumed to exist. The Markov process Y is assumed to consist of components in the following sense (Schweder, 1970).\nDefinition 2.1 Composable Markov process Let V = {1, . . . ,K}, K \u2265 2, and assume that there are K spaces Sk, k \u2208 V , with |Sk| \u2265 2, and that there exists a one-to-one mapping f of S onto \u2297k\u2208V Sk so that elements y \u2208 S can be identified with elements (y1, . . . , yK) \u2208 \u2297 k\u2208V Sk. Then, a Markov process Y is a composable process with components Y1, . . . , YK given by f(Y(t)) = (Y1(t), . . . , YK(t)) if for all A \u2282 V , |A| \u2265 2,\nlim h\u21930 1 h P\n( \u22c2\nk\u2208A {Yk(t + h) 6= yk}\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u22c2\nk\u2208A {Yk(t) = yk}\n) = 0\nfor all yk \u2208 Sk, k \u2208 V , and t \u2208 T . We then write Y \u223c (Y1, . . . , YK).\nThe definition implies that for a composable process the probability that more than one component changes in a short period of length h is of magnitude o(h). Hence, any change of state can be represented as a change in only one of the components which justifies regarding the processes as composed of different components. The components are not necessarily unique. If for example Y \u223c (Y1, . . . , YK) then Y \u223c (YA,YB) with A \u2282 V and B = V \\A. Note that the components of such a Markov process correspond to the local variables of Nodelman et al. (2002).\nFrom now, we consider composable finite Markov processes (CFMPs) and write \u03b1(t; (y,y\u2032)) instead of \u03b1yy\u2032(t) for notational convenience. Schweder (1970) proves the following.\nCorollary 2.2 Transition intensities for CFMPs Let Y \u223c (Y1, . . . , YK) be a CFMP. The intensity\n\u03b1(t; (y,y\u2032)) for any y 6= y\u2032 \u2208 S is given by \u03b1(t; (y,y\u2032)) = {\n\u03b1k(t; (y, y\u2032k)), yk 6= y\u2032k \u2227 y\u2212k = y\u2032\u2212k 0, else,\nwhere y\u2212k = yV \\{k}, and\n\u03b1k(t; (y, y\u2032k)) = lim h\u21930 1 h P (Yk(t + h) = y\u2032k | Y(t) = y) .\nThe dependence structure of (Y1, . . . , YK) is thus determined by the quantities \u03b1k(t; (y, y\u2032k)),y \u2208 S, y\u2032k \u2208 Sk\\{yk}, k \u2208 V .\nDefinition 2.3 Local independence in a CFMP Let Y \u223c (Y1, . . . , YK) be a CFMP. Then, Yj is locally independent of Yk, k 6= j, if and only if \u03b1j(t; (y, y\u2032j)) is constant in the k-th component yk of the first argument \u2200 y\u2212k \u2208 S\u2212k and y\u2032j \u2208 Sj , y\u2032j 6= yj , for all t \u2208 T . We denote this by {k} \u2192/ {j}|V \\{j, k}. For disjoint subsets A,B,C of V we say that B \u2192/ A|C if for all j \u2208 A the transition intensities \u03b1j(t; (y, y\u2032j)) are constant in all the components yB of y for any yA\u222aC \u2208 SA\u222aC and y\u2032j \u2208 Sj , y\u2032j 6= yj , written as B \u2192/ A|C.\nSince for small h > 0\nP ( Yj(t + h) = y\u2032j | Y(t) = y ) \u2248 h \u00b7 \u03b1j(t; (y, y\u2032j)) one can roughly say that {k} \u2192/ {j}|V \\{j, k} means Yj(t + h) is conditionally independent of Yk(t) given Y\u2212k(t) for small h, hence local independence.\nA straightforward graphical representation of local dependence structures is to depict components Yk by nodes and local dependencies by directed edges. We can then summarize the transition intensities as \u03b1k(t; (ycl(k), y \u2032 k)), where cl(k) is the closure of node k, i.e. its parents and itself. In the terminology of Nodelman et al. (2002), a component Yk can be regarded as a conditional Markov process, the transition intensities of which depend on the states of Ypa(k) and can be represented in a collection of conditional transition matrices for the transitions yk \u2192 y\u2032k, yk 6= y\u2032k \u2208 Sk, one matrix for each value of ypa(k) \u2208 Spa(k). In the above we assume that a component is always locally dependent on its own past so that this is not explicitly stated in the conditioning set when writing {k} \u2192/ {j}|V \\{j, k} or in the parent set in the corresponding graph. For practical applications it seems unlikely that a component is locally independent of itself, but such processes can of course be constructed. If we wanted to allow this, the graphs would need to be extended to include self\u2013loops (j, j), j \u2208 V , and there would be a difference between {k} \u2192/ {j}|V \\{j, k} and {k} \u2192/ {j}|V \\{k}. But we do not pursue this any further here."}, {"heading": "2.2 MULTI\u2013STATE PROCESSES", "text": "Marginally, a subprocess YA, A \u2282 V , of a CFMP is not necessarily Markov anymore unless pa(A) = \u2205 (Didelez, 2005b). Hence it is useful to generalize the notion of local independence to a larger class of processes like multi\u2013state processes that are not necessarily Markov (cf. Didelez, 2005a).\nLet Y denote a multi\u2013state process with a one\u2013to\u2013one mapping of its state space S onto \u2297Sk yielding the components Y1, . . . , YK similar to Definition 2.1. Let further FAt , A \u2282 V , denote the filtration generated by the subprocess YA, i.e. FAt = \u03c3{YA(s), s \u2264 t}. Then we assume that for each component Yk there exists a process \u039bk such that Mk = Yk \u2212 \u039bk is a FVt \u2013 martingale, i.e.\nYk = \u039bk + Mk. (1)\nProperty (1) is the Doob\u2013Meyer decomposition (cf. Andersen et al., 1993) and is similar to a regression model, where \u039bk(t) is the predictor based on the past FVt\u2212 of this and all other components (formally this means that \u039bk(t) is a FVt \u2013predictable compensator), and Mt corresponds to a zero\u2013mean error term (conditionally on the past). Further, the martingales Mk, k = 1, . . . , K, are assumed to be orthogonal, which can be regarded as a dynamic version of an \u2018independent errors\u2019 assumption. It also ensures that no two components \u2018jump\u2019 at the same time in analogy to Definition 2.1.\nFor a Markov process the predictor \u039bk(t) can be constructed from the transition intensities and suitable indicator functions for the state of a process just before the transition. If it is absolutely continuous then its derivative \u03bbk(t) is called the intensity process. E.g. for a Markov process Y , and considering one particular transition q \u2192 r, we have \u03bbqr(t) = \u03b1qr(t)I{Y (t\u2212)=q}, q 6= r \u2208 S, and \u039bqr(t) = \u222b t 0 \u03bbqr(s)ds.\nUnder mild regularity conditions the assumptions allowing (1) are also satisfied by multivariate counting processes and hence by (not necessarily Markovian) multi\u2013state processes, where each change of state can be represented as a jump in a multivariate counting process (cf. Andersen et al., 1993). This leads to the following more general definition of local independence.\nDefinition 2.4 Local independence Let Y \u223c (Y1, . . . , YK) satisfy the above assumptions. Then, Yj is locally independent of Yk, k 6= j, if and only if \u039bj(t) is F\u2212kt \u2013measurable for all t \u2208 T . In words this means that the predictor \u039bj does not depend on the past history of the component Yk given the whole past of all other components."}, {"heading": "3 GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION", "text": "We now formally define the graphs representing local independence structures.\nDefinition 3.1 Local independence graph Let YV \u223c (Y1, . . . , YK) be a composable process satisfying the assumptions of Section 2.2 and let G = (V, E) be a directed graph, where V = {1, . . . , K} and E \u2282 {(j, k)|j, k \u2208 V, j 6= k}. Then G is the local independence graph of YV if for all j, k \u2208 V\n(j, k) /\u2208 E \u21d4 {j} \u2192/ {k} | V \\{j, k}. (2)\nWe can regard (2) as a dynamic version of the pairwise Markov property (Lauritzen, 1996) and hence call it the pairwise dynamic Markov property.\nIn the special case of YV being a homogenous Markov process its local independence graph is the same as a continuous time Bayesian network (Nodelman et al., 2002).\nA local independence graph is directed but not necessarily acyclic. Furthermore, it allows two edges between two vertices, one in each direction. The notation familiar for DAGs can still be applied, such as parents, ancestors, non\u2013descendants. In particular we will need the notion of an ancestral set An(A) = an(A) \u222a A. Also, the operation of moralizing a graph can be carried out as usual, by marrying parents of a common child and then making the whole graph undirected, i.e. Gm = (V, Em) with Em = {{j, k}| (j, k) \u2208 E or (k, j) \u2208 E} \u222a {{j, k}|\u2203 \u03c5 \u2208 V : j, k \u2208pa(\u03c5)}. In Gm we can check for usual separation in undirected graphs and will denote this by the symbol \u22a5\u22a5u . In Section 2.1 we said that the transition intensities can be summarized as \u03b1k(t; (ycl(k), y \u2032 k)). In the general case this corresponds to the following property.\nDefinition 3.2 Local dynamic Markov property Let G = (V, E) be a directed graph. For a multivariate process YV the property\n\u2200 k \u2208 V : V \\cl(k) \u2192/ {k} | pa(k), (3) is called the local dynamic Markov property w.r.t. G.\nIn general (2) does not imply (3), e.g. if two components, k, l say, contain the same information we might have that {k} \u2192/ {j}|{l} as well as {l} \u2192/ {j}|{k} without {k, l} \u2192/ {j}. However under additional conditions, such as the one of orthogonal martingales, we can show that in our setting the implication holds, because counting processes that are almost sure identical do not have orthogonal martingales (Andersen et al., 1993, p.73). The precise condition for the implication (2) \u21d2 (3) is given by (9) below.\nIn order to formulate a global dynamic Markov property we need a suitable notion of separation.\nDefinition 3.3 \u03b4\u2013separation Let G = (V, E) be a directed graph. For B \u2282 V , let GB denote the graph given by deleting all directed edges of G starting in B, i.e. GB = (V,EB) with EB = E\\{(j, k)|j \u2208 B, k \u2208 V }. Then, we say for pairwise disjoint subsets A,B,C \u2282 V that C \u03b4\u2013separates A from B in G if A\u22a5\u22a5u B|C in the undirected graph (GBAn(A\u222aB\u222aC))\nm. In case that A,B and C are not disjoint we define that C \u03b4\u2013separates A from B if C\\B \u03b4\u2013separates A\\(B\u222aC) from B. The empty set is always separated from B. Additionally, we define that the empty set \u03b4\u2013separates A from B if A and B are unconnected in (GBAn(A\u222aB)) m.\nNote that deleting edges out of B does not change An(A\u222aB \u222aC) so that GBAn(A\u222aB\u222aC) is not ambiguous. Equivalently to Definition 3.3 we can use a trail condition, where a trail is a sequence of not necessarily direction preserving edges connecting two nodes. Define that any allowed trail from A to B contains no edge of the form (b, k), b \u2208 B, k \u2208 V \\B. Then, for disjoint subsets A,B,C of V , we have that C \u03b4\u2013separates A from B if and only if all allowed trails from A to B are d\u2013separated by C (Didelez, 2000, pp.22).\nAs mentioned above, \u03b4\u2013separation is not symmetric in A and B. This can be seen in the simple graph given in Figure 2(a). From the moral graphs in Figures 2(b) and (c) we see that a\u22a5\u22a5u b|c in (Ga)m but not in (Gb)m. Alternatively, there are two trails between a and b: {(a, b)} and {(c, a), (b, c)}. Consider separating b from a, then the first trail is not allowed and the second is d\u2013separated by c since the directed edges do not meet head\u2013to\u2013head in c. In contrast, if we want to separate a from b, the second path is not allowed and the first is not d\u2013separated by c. Hence c \u03b4\u2013separates b from a but not a from b.\nThe significance of \u03b4\u2013separation is due to the following global dynamic Markov property.\nDefinition 3.4 Global dynamic Markov property Let YV \u223c (Y1, . . . , YK) be a composable process and G = (V, E) a directed graph. For disjoint subsets\nA,B, C \u2282 V the property\nC \u03b4\u2013separates A from B in G \u21d2 A \u2192/ B | C. (4)\nis called the global dynamic Markov property w.r.t. G.\nTo understand why \u03b4\u2013separation works, consider again the above example, Figure 2(a). For a Markov process and small h > 0 this corresponds to the infinitesimal conditional independencies in Figure 3. Checking, e.g. whether c \u03b4\u2013separates b from a corresponds to Ya(t + h)\u22a5\u22a5Yb(t)|(Ya(t), Yc(t)), which can be verified in Figure 3. Whereas c \u03b4\u2013separating a from b would mean to Ya(t)\u22a5\u22a5Yb(t + h)|(Yb(t), Yc(t)), which is clearly not the case."}, {"heading": "4 ASYMMETRIC GRAPHOIDS", "text": "The (semi)graphoid axioms first introduced by Dawid (1979) (cf. also Pearl and Paz, 1987; Pearl, 1988, p. 84; Dawid, 2001) are properties that we would like to be satisfied by an irrelevance relation. They hold for instance for undirected graph separation \u22a5\u22a5u and for d\u2013 separation (Verma and Pearl, 1988) as well as for probabilistic conditional independence. Symmetry is one of the basic (semi)graphoid properties. As yet, there is no general framework for asymmetric irrelevance relations available although other examples apart from local independence exist (e.g. Dawid, 1979, 1980; Galles and Pearl, 1996; Cozman and Walley, 1999). In the following we re\u2013define the (semi)graphoid axioms for the asymmetric case and check which of them are satisfied by \u03b4\u2013separation and local independence.\nDefinition 4.1 Asymmetric (semi)graphoid Consider a lattice (V,\u2264), where A \u2228 B denotes the least upper bound and A\u2227B the largest lower bound. Further, let (A irB|C) be a ternary relation on this lattice.

For a ternary relation A irB|C that satisfies left redundancy, decomposition, and contraction we have that\nA irB | C \u21d4 A\\C irB | C. (5) For a ternary relation that satisfies right redundancy, decomposition, and contraction we have that\nA irB | C \u21d4 A irB\\C | C.

Additionally, it follows from left redundancy (i.e. C irB|C) and left decomposition that (C \u2229 A) irB|C. Left contraction now yields the desired result. Property (6) is shown similarly.\nThe following corollary exploits (5) and (6) to reformulate the intersection property in a more familiar way.\nCorollary 4.3 Alternative intersection property Let V be the power set of V and A,B, C \u2208 V.

With the same argument we get C irB|(A \u222a D) \u21d2 (C \u222aD) irB|(A\u222aD). Left intersection yields (A\u222aC \u222a D) irB|D which is again equivalent to (A\u222aC) irB|D because of (5).

It is of similar importance for local independence graphs.\nProposition 4.6 Left intersection Under the assumption that\nFAt \u2229 FBt = FA\u2229Bt \u2200 A,B \u2282 V, \u2200 t \u2208 T (9) the property of left intersection holds for local independence.\nProof: Left intersection assumes that the FA\u222aB\u222aCt \u2013 compensators \u039bk(t), k \u2208 B, are FB\u222aCt \u2013 as well as FA\u222aBt \u2013measurable. With (9) we get that they are FB\u222a(A\u2229C)t \u2013measurable which yields the desired result. Property (9) formalizes the intuitive notion that the considered components of the process are \u2018different enough\u2019 to ensure that common events in the past are necessarily due to common components. Its main consequence is the following.\nCorollary 4.7 Pairwise implies local dynamic MP Under (9) the pairwise dynamic Markov property (2) and the local one (3) are equivalent.\nProof: (3) \u21d2 (2) follows from left weak union and left decomposition. (2)\u21d2 (3) follows immediately from (7) which holds if (9) holds.\nRight decomposition requires special consideration because it makes a statement about the irrelevance of a subprocess YA after discarding part of the possibly relevant information YB\\D. If the irrelevance of YA is due to knowing the past of YB\\D then it will not necessarily be irrelevant anymore if the latter is discarded. It therefore only holds under specific restrictions on the relation among the processes. The first restriction exploits property (9) to show that under an additional condition right decomposition also holds for local independence.\nProposition 4.8 Right decomposition (I) Given (9) right decomposition holds for local independence under the following additional conditions:\n(B \u2229A)\\(C \u222aD) = \u2205 and B \u2192/ D | A \u222a C.

So far, however, the conditions for (6) and (8) are not satisfied because right redundancy does not hold. By definition right redundancy would imply that A ir\u03b4 B|B \u21d4 A\\B ir\u03b4 B|\u2205 which is only true if A\\B and B are unconnected in (GBAn(A\u222aB))\nm. A simple counterexample is given by the graph with V = {a, b} and E = {(a, b)}. Additionally, property (6) does not hold, as can be seen by another example shown in Figure 4.

In contrast, the converse does hold because it is a special case of the subsequent result paralleling Lemma 4.5.\nLemma 4.11 Special version of right decomposition Given a directed graph G, it holds that:\nA ir\u03b4 B | C, D \u2282 B \u21d2 A ir\u03b4 D | (C \u222aB)\\D\nProof: Let A\u2217 = A\\(B\u222aC) and C\u2217 = C\\B. Then, we have to show that A\u2217\u22a5\u22a5u B|C\u2217 in (GBAn(A\u222aB\u222aC))m implies A\u2217\u22a5\u22a5u D|C\u2217 \u222a (B\\D) in (GDAn(A\u222aB\u222aC))m.

Changing the graph to (GDAn(A\u222aB\u222aC)) m means that all edges\nthat are present in G as directed edges starting in B\\D are added. Additionally, those edges have to be added which result from vertices in B\\D having common children with other vertices.

In the first case we delete the arrow from b to a whereas in the second case it is kept. However, we can obtain the following result paralleling Propositions 4.8 and 4.9.\nProposition 4.13 Right decomposition Right decomposition holds for \u03b4\u2013separation in the special case that (A \u2229B)\\(C \u222aD) = \u2205 and\n(i) either B ir\u03b4 D|(A \u222a C) (ii) or B ir\u03b4 A\\(C \u222a D)|(C \u222a D) and for all\nk \u2208 C\\D either A ir\u03b4 {k}|((C\\{k}) \u222a B) or B ir\u03b4 {k}|((C\\{k}) \u222aD \u222aA).\nProof: Didelez (2000, pp.31).\nProperty (i) of Proposition 4.13 is illustrated in Figure 6 which includes the moral graph (Gd)m. Choose A = {a}, B = {b, d} and C = {c}. Property (ii) of Proposition 4.13 is illustrated in Figure 7 which includes the moral graph (Gd)m. Choose A = {a}, B = {b, d} and C = {c}. Roughly one can summarize the assumptions of Proposition 4.13 as that either B\\D does not affect D or A and B\\D do not affect common nodes in C as this would open a path between them.\nThe main consequence of the properties of local independence and \u03b4\u2013separation is that we can indeed use \u03b4\u2013separation to read off local independencies among sub\u2013processes from a local independence graph.\nTheorem 4.14 Pairwise implies global MP With the above properties, using right decomposition under the conditions specified by Propositions 4.8, 4.9 and 4.13, we have that the pairwise dynamic Markov property (2) and the global dynamic Markov property (4) are equivalent.\nProof: That (4) implies (2) is easily seen because V \\{j, k} \u03b4\u2013separates j from k if (j, k) /\u2208 E. The structure of the proof of (2) \u21d2 (4) corresponds to the one given by Lauritzen (1996, p. 34) for the equivalence of the Markov properties in undirected conditional independence graphs. Due to the asymmetry of local independence the present proof is more complicated and is given in Didelez (2000, pp.90).\nIn order to illustrate the significance of Theorem 4.14 we return to the example given in the Introduction and depicted in Figure 1. We can see from the graph that in an analysis that only uses data on the visits, hospitalization and survival, i.e. where health status is ignored, we might find that survival depends on the visits. This is somewhat surprising as the visit process is locally independent of the health status process\ngiven the other components. The reason is that the node \u2018visits\u2019 is not separated from \u2018survival\u2019 by \u2018hospitalization\u2019 alone. In other words, a history of e.g. hospitalization without prior visit by a nurse carries a different information than a history of hospitalization with prior visit \u2014 it is informative for the unobserved health process. The health status could be regarded as a particular type of time dependent confounder."}, {"heading": "5 DISCUSSION", "text": "Local independence graphs and \u03b4\u2013separation represent dynamic dependencies among continuous time multi\u2013 state processes.
