The classification is the process of predicting the classes among the huge amount of dataset by using some machine learning algorithms. The classification of different tumor types in gene expression data is of great importance in cancer diagnosis and drug discovery but it is more complex because of its huge size. DNA micro array technologies have made it possible to measure the expression levels of thousand of genes in a single experiment. There are multiple techniques available to analyze a gene expression profiles. A common characteristic of these techniques is selecting a subset of genes which is very informative for classification process and to reduce the dimensionality problem of profiles. In this research work ,Entropy based filtering approach is used for ranking the cancer genes and the top most genes were selected [1].Genes selected are classified by using Fuzzy Soft Sets and this classification approach reduced the complexity and increased the accuracy of classification compared with standard Fuzzy KNN algorithm and KNN. This paper also illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach over the other popular classification approaches such as K-Nearest Neighbor approach and Fuzzy KNN approach."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORK", "text": "Soft set theory was initiated by Molodstov to solve some uncertainties among data which is not solved by traditional mathematical tools.
