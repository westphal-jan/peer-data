Our idea is based on some characteristics of the Romanian language, where some prepositions, adverbs or some specific endings can provide a lot of information about the structure of a complex sentence. Such characteristics can be found in other languages, too, such as French. Using a special grammar, we developed a system (DIASEXP) that can perform a dialogue in natural language with assertive and interogative sentences about a \u201cstory\u201d (a set of sentences describing some events from the real life).\nKEYWORDS\nNatural Language Processing, Syntactic Analysis, Morphology, Grammar, Romanian Language"}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "Before making a semantic analysis of natural language, we should define the lexicon and syntactic rules of a formal grammar useful in generating simple sentences in the respective language (for example, English, French, or Romanian).\nWe shall consider a simple grammar, having some rules for the lexicon, and some rules for the grammatical categories. The rules for the lexicon will be of the type (1):"}, {"heading": "G \u2192 W (1)", "text": "where G is a grammatical category (or part of speech) and W is an word from a certain dictionary.\nThe other syntactic rules will be of the type (2):"}, {"heading": "G1 \u2192 G2 G3 (2)", "text": "meaning that the first grammatical category (G1) forms out of the concatenation of the other two (G2 and G3), from the right side of the arrow.\nOur simple grammar is presented in Figure 1. It contains only few Romanian words and the syntax rules constitute a subset of the Romanian syntax rules:\nIn Figure 1, we used these notations: S = sentence, NP = noun phrase, VP = verb phrase, N = noun, Det = determiner (article), AP = adjectival phrase, A = adjective, C = conjunction, V = verb, CA = group made up of a conjunction and an adjective.\nThis grammar generates correct sentences in English, such as:\n\u2022 Orice femeie iube\u015fte. (Every woman loves.) \u2022 Un \u0219oarece ur\u0103\u0219te o pisic\u0103. (A mouse hates a cat.) \u2022 Fiecare b\u0103rbat de\u0219tept iube\u0219te o femeie frumoas\u0103 \u0219i de\u0219teapt\u0103. (Every smart man\nloves a beautiful and smart woman.)\nOn the other hand, this grammar rejects incorrect phrases, such as \u201corice iube\u0219te un b\u0103rbat\u201d (\u201cany loves a man\u201d). The previously phrases contains words only from the chosen vocabulary. However, our grammar overgenerates, that is, it generates sentences that are grammatically incorrect, such as \"Ea frumoas\u0103 sau de\u0219teapt\u0103 iube\u0219te\" (\u201cShe beautiful or smart loves\u201d), \u201cEl iube\u0219te el\u201d (\u201cHe loves he\u201d), and \"O b\u0103rbat iube\u0219te pisic\u0103\" (\u201cAn man loves cat\u201d), even these phrases contain words from the selected lexicon.\nAlso, the grammar subgenerates, meaning that there are many sentences in Romanian that grammar rejects, such as \"Orice femeie iube\u0219te sau ur\u0103\u0219te un b\u0103rbat\". This phrase is correct in Romanian, and contains words from the given dictionary. Also, the phrase \"ni\u0219te c\u00e2ini ur\u0103sc o pisic\u0103\" (\"some dogs hate a cat\"), although syntactically correct in Romanian, is not accepted because it contains words that have not been entered into our vocabulary.\nThe syntactic analysis or the parsing of a string of words may be seen as a process of searching for a derivation tree. This may be achieved either starting from S and searching for a tree with the words from the given phrase as leaves (top-down parsing) or starting from the words and searching for a tree with the root S (bottom-up parsing). An algorithm of efficient parsing is based on dynamic programming: each time that we analyze the phrase or the string of words, we store the result so that we may not have to reanalyze it later. For example, as soon as we have discovered that a string of words is a NP, we may record the result in a data structure called chart. The algorithms that perform this operation are called chart-parsers. The chart-parser algorithm uses a polynomial time and a polynomial space. In (P\u0103tru\u0163 & Boghian, 2010) we developed a chart-parser, based on the Cocke, Younger, and Kasami algorithm. We presented a Delphi application that analyzes the lexicon and the syntax of a sentence in Romanian. We used a Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammar (Chomsky, 1965)."}, {"heading": "2. USING THE DEFINITE CLAUSE GRAMMARS", "text": "In order for our grammar not to generate incorrect sentences, we should use the notions of gender, number, case etc. specifying, for example, that \"femeie\u201d and \u201cfrumoas\u0103\" have the feminine gender, and the singular number. The string \u201cEl iube\u0219te ea\u201d is incorrect, because \u201cea\u201d is in nominative case, and we should use the \u201cpe\u201d preposition in order to obtain the accusative case. The correct phrase is \u201cEl iube\u0219te pe ea\u201d, or even\u201cEl o iube\u0219te pe ea.\u201d (\u201cHe loves her\u201d).\nIf we take into account the case, grammar is no longer independent from the context: it is not true that any NP is equal to any other NP irrespective of the context. Nevertheless, if we want to work with a grammar that is independent from the context, we may split the category NP into two, NPN and NPA, in order to represent verbal groups in the nominative (subjective), respectively accusative (objective) case. We shall also have to split the category Pron into two categories, PronN (including \"El\" and PronA (including \"pe ea\" (\u201cher\u201d), which contains the preposition \u201cpe\u201d in front of the pronoun \u201cea\u201d) (Russel & Norvig, 2002)\nAnother issue concerns the agreement between the subject and main verb of the sentence (predicate). For example, if \"Eu\" (\u201cI\u201d) is the subject, then \"Eu iubesc\" (\u201cI love\u201d) is grammatically correct, whereas \"Eu iube\u0219te\" (\u201cI loves\u201d) is not. Then we shall have to split NPN and NPA into several alternatives in order to reach the agreement. As we identify more and more distinctions, we eventually obtain an exponential number.\nA more efficient solution is to improve (\"augment\") the existing grammar rules by using parameters for non-terminal categories. The categories NP and Pron have parameters called gender, number and case. The rule for the NP has as arguments the variables gender, number and case.\nThis formalism of improvement is called definite clause grammar (DCG) because each grammar rule may be interpreted as a definite clause in Horn\u2019s logic (Pereira & Warren, 1980), (Giurca, 1997).\nUsing adequate predicates, a CFG (context free grammar) rule as S \u2192 NP VP will be written in the form of the definite clause NP(s1)  VP(s2) => S(s1+s2), with the meaning that if s1 is NP, s2 is VP, then the concatenation of s1 with s2 is S. DCGs allow us to see parsing as a logical inference (Klein, 2005). The real benefit of the DCG approach is that we can improve the symbols of categories with additional arguments, for example the rule NP(gender)\u2192N(gender) turns into the definite clause N(gender, s1) \u21d2 NP(gender, s1), meaning that if s1 is a noun with the gender gender, then s1 is also a noun phrase with the same gender. Generally, we may supplement a symbol of category with any number of arguments, and the arguments are parameters that constitute the subject of unification like in the common inference of Horn\u2019s clauses (Russel & Norvig, 2002).\nEven with the improvements brought by DCG, incorrect sentences may still be overgenerated. In order deal with the correct verbal groups in some situations, we shall have to split the category V into two subcategories, one for the verbs with no object and one for the verbs with a single object, and so on. Thus, we shall have to specify which expressions (groups) may follow each verb, that is, realize a subcategorization of that verb by the list of objects. An object is a compulsory expression that follows the verb within a verbal group.\nBecause there are a lot of problems in dealing with the syntactic analysis or a phrase, the time of the processing the complex situations of the texts in Romanian language, describing real life situations, we decided to use some morphological characteristic features of the Romanian words, that can be useful in order to determine the parts of the sentences."}, {"heading": "2. THE IDEA FOR SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS BASED ON MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF THE LANGUAGE", "text": "As we explain in the introduction, the classic ideas of syntactic analysis uses lexicons (dictionaries), CFG or DCG grammars and chart-parsers, as that developed by us in (P\u0103tru\u0163 & Boghian, 2010).\nIn the previous sections, we note the following:\n1. Using a CFG grammar, syntactically correct sentences (in Romanian) are accepted, as well as incorrect ones. 2. The power of the analysis system (for example a chart-parser), based on such a grammar depends on the extent of the vocabulary used. 3. The power of a chart-parser can be improved using DCG grammars. This implies to extent the set of the syntactic rules, with a lot of new rules, using special variables (like gender, case, number etc.).\nAs concerns the first and the last issues, let us assume that the system will not be required to analyze incorrect sentences, therefore we consider the grammar satisfactory. Regarding the second problem, it could be solved by strongly enriching the vocabulary, a fact that would require the elaboration and implementing of some data structures and searching techniques as efficient as possible, which, however, will not function in real time, in some cases. Of course, the main problem would be to write as comprehensive a grammar as possible, close to the linguistic realities of Romanian morphology, taking into consideration the diversity of forms (and\nmeanings) that a sentence can get in the Romanian language. However, the extent and complexity of grammar leads to slowing the analysis, therefore this will not be done in real-time, in all cases.\nIn this section we will suggest a real-time solution, based on the idea of using:\n\u2022 some words or groups of words that indicate grammatical category; \u2022 some specific endings of the inflected words that indicate some parts of sentence.\nOur idea is based on some characteristics of the Romanian language, where some prepositions or some specific endings can provide us a lot of information about the structure of a complex phrase. Such characteristics can be found in other languages, too, such as French. Using our ideas, we developed a system that uses a special grammar, which we will explain.\nThe morphology of the Romanian language allows the developing of a special syntactic analysis that makes full use of certain characteristics of words when they are inflected (declined or conjugated) or under different hypostases.\nWith a view to \"understanding\" a Romanian sentence, to finding the constituent parts, which would favor the translation of the sentence into another language, in real time, we suggest a simple solution, based on patterns:\n\u2022 there is a minimal vocabulary of key words: prefixes1, linking words, endings; \u2022 a relatively limited grammar is realized in which the terminals are some words, either with\ngiven endings or from another given vocabulary; \u2022 the user is asked to respect some restrictions of sentence word order (relatively a few); \u2022 the user is assumed to be well meaning.\nIn Figure 2 it is presented the general scheme for such an analyzer (P\u0103tru\u0163 & Boghian, 2012). In Figure 2, we select the concrete case of the sentence: \"Copii cei cumin\u0163i au recitat o poezie p\u0103rin\u0163ilor, \u00een fa\u0163a \u015fcolii.\" (\"The good children recited a poem to their parents, in front of the school\").\nIn stage 2 predicate nouns and adjectives are identified (introduced by pronouns or prepositions), direct or indirect objects, \"inarticulate\" (used without an article) (introduced by articles, prepositions and prepositional phrases respectively), adverbials; in stage 3 \"articled\" direct and indirect objects are identified etc.\nFollowing the logic of processes within the analyzer, we notice that the final result (that is correct in our case, up to an additional detailing) is approximate because the system is based on the observations made by us, which are:\n\u2022 In Romanian, the subject usually precedes the predicate: \"copiii\" (\"the children\") before \"au recitat\" (\"recited\"); \u2022 There are some words (or groups of words) (that we call prefixes or indicators) that introduce adverbials (\"\u00een fa\u0163a...\"( \"in front of\") = place adverbial; \"fiindc\u0103...\" (\"because\"), \"din cauz\u0103 c\u0103...\" = cause adverbial; \"pentru a...\" (\"for\")= purpose adverbial; \u2022 The predicate nouns, the adjectives and the objects (direct and indirect) can be introduced by indicating prefixes (\"lui...\" (Ion, Gheorghe etc.) (\"to...\") = indirect object (or predicate noun),\n1 by prefixes we understand words or groups of words, having the role to indicate the \"sense\" of the next words from the phrase.\n\"o...\" (\"fat\u0103\" (\"girl\"), \"pisic\u0103\" (\"cat\") etc.) (\"a\u2026\") = direct object, if these have not been already identified as subject. Thus, it is to assume that we will say: \"un b\u0103iat cite\u015fte o carte\" (\"a boy is reading a book\") and not \"o carte (e ceea ce) cite\u015fte un b\u0103iat\" or \"o carte este citit\u0103 de un b\u0103iat\" (\"a book (is that which) a boy is reading\" or \"a book is being read by a boy\"), therefore the subject precedes the object);\n\u2022 Some endings offer sufficient information about the nature of the respective words (in the word \u2018p\u0103rin\u0163ilor\u2019 the ending \u2018-ilor\u2019 indicates an indirect object2, just like \u2018-ei\u2019 from \u2018fetei\u2019, \u2018mamei\u2019 indicates the same type of object, the \u2018-ul\u2019 from \u2018b\u0103iatul\u2019, \u2018creionul\u2019 indicate however a direct object (\"articled\").\nWe thus notice that our sentence, recognized by an analyzer of the type presented above is (structurally) complex enough as compared to the famous \"orice b\u0103rbat iube\u015fte o femeie\" (\"any man loves a woman\"), given as an example for classic chart-parsers.\nIt should also be noted that the sentence \"I o i pe M, deoarece M e f\" (\"J l M, because M i b\") could be recognized by the analyzer on the basis of the pattern:\n\u2022 <subiect> <predicat> pe <complement direct>, deoarece <circumstan\u0163ial de cauz\u0103>. \u2022 (<subject> <predicate>[on] <direct object>because <cause adverbial>)\nThus, the above \"sentence\", although meaningless in Romanian, would enter the same category as: \"Ion o iube\u015fte pe Maria, deoarece Maria este frumoas\u0103\" (\"John loves Mary because Mary is beautiful\"), a category represented by the pattern mentioned above.\n2 Of course, \u201cp\u0103rin\u0163ilor\u201d could be an indirect object as well as a predicative noun, like in the sentence \"the good children recited the poems of their parents in front of the school\"/ \"copiii cei cumin\u0163i au recitat poeziile p\u0103rin\u0163ilor, \u00een fa\u0163a \u015fcolii\", therefore frequently not even grammar can solve the system\u2019s ambiguities."}, {"heading": "3. CREATING AND CONSULTING A DATABASE", "text": "Of course, by introducing more such sentences (phrases), the user can create a table in a database with the structure of a sentence; therefore each entry would contain the fields: subject, predicate, predicative noun, direct object, indirect object, place adverbial etc. The detailed structure of the table is presented in section 5, when we will discuss about the DIASEXP shystem we developed. Consulting such a database would be made through Romanian interrogative sentences (phrases), for example:\n\u2022 Cine <predicat> <complement direct> ? (\"Cine cite\u015fte cartea ?\") (Who <predicate><direct object>? (\"Who is reading the book?\"))\nin order to find out the <subject>, using a search engine based on pattern-matching (matching patterns), in which the search clues would be the predicate (\u2018is reading\u2019), and also the direct object (\u2018book\u2019).\nAlthough the results of the analysis (and by this the answers to the questions also) have a high degree of precision that depends on respecting the word order restrictions imposed by the vocabulary taken into consideration, such a system that we have realised and that works in real time can be successfully used. (Moreover, the system realised by us may enrich, through learning, its vocabulary so that, by using only the 300 initial words and endings it may cover a wide range of situations)."}, {"heading": "4.

CONCLUSIONS", "text": "CFG and DCG are types of generative grammars used in the syntactic analysis of a phrase in natural language. Sometimes, long or complex phrases will be a problem for the classic chartparsers. The characteristic features of the Romanian language related to the morphology of words or the way in which adverbials are formed can be successfully used in the syntactic analysis by using a system based on patterns. This system will work in real-time and will not record the whole dictionary of Romanian language. It will use a small dictionary of \u201cprefixes\u201d (prepositions, adverbs etc.), and some endings and linking words."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "The authors would like to thank to professors Dan Cristea, Grigor Moldovan and Ioan Andone for their advices and observations during the research activities."}], "references": [{"title": "Aspects of the Theory of Syntax", "author": ["N.

We will suggest a real-time solution, based on the idea of using some words or groups of words that indicate grammatical category; and some specific endings of some parts of sentence. Our idea is based on some characteristics of the Romanian language, where some prepositions, adverbs or some specific endings can provide a lot of information about the structure of a complex sentence. Such characteristics can be found in other languages, too, such as French. Using a special grammar, we developed a system (DIASEXP) that can perform a dialogue in natural language with assertive and interogative sentences about a \u201cstory\u201d (a set of sentences describing some events from the real life).", "creator": "Microsoft Office Word"}}}
