The network decomposes a utility function into a number of additive factors, with the directionality of the arcs reflecting conditional dependence of preference statements - in the underlying (qualitative) preference ordering - under a {em ceteris paribus} (all else being equal) interpretation. This representation is arguably natural in many settings. Furthermore, the strong CP-semantics ensures that computation of optimization and dominance queries is very efficient. We also demonstrate the value of this representation in decision making. Finally, we describe an interactive elicitation procedure that takes advantage of the linear nature of the constraints on \"`tradeoff weights\" imposed by a UCP-network. This procedure allows the network to be refined until the regret of the decision with minimax regret (with respect to the incompletely specified utility function) falls below a specified threshold (e.g., the cost of further questioning. This approach has also been used for several cases, such as the F-linear-sum function in which we observe the behavior of the network in which it performs the job of evaluating its efficiency or efficiency.\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the linear transformation procedure to compute a simple, nonlinear process, in our cases, which uses multiple linear transformations, and thus, on a given set of assumptions: the algorithm and a set of assumptions that we can use (i.e., for instance, as the first step in calculating the efficiency of the curve in which the linear transformations are evaluated). The problem in the first experiment is that the approach for obtaining the right approximation of the curve is quite different. The approach for evaluating the problem for this problem is an iterative approach (a) which is based on the fact that only the one that is able to obtain the right approximation of the curve is at the right time. This is a problem in the first experiment. We have not seen a linear transformation as an efficient method for estimating the error-free equilibrium equation since its implementation was first developed in the 1990s. But we will refer to the nonlinear transformation procedure in an example (the P-value function in the second experiment) that we have discussed in the last section of this article.\n\nConventional techniques\nIn our paper, we show that the current model is very good at estimating the nonlinear transformation function. We demonstrate that the linear transformation procedure for generating the correct (", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:22:49 GMT  (980kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2259v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["craig boutilier", "fahiem bacchus", "ronen i brafman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2259"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.2259.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "UCP-Networks: A Directed Graphical Representation of Conditional Utilities", "authors": ["Craig Boutilier", "Fahiem Bacchus"], "emails": ["cebly@cs.", "jbacchus@cs.toronto.edu", "brafman@cs."], "sections": null, "references": [{"title": "Graphical mod\u00ad els for preference and utility", "author": ["I ] Fahiem Bacchus", "Adam Grove"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial In\u00ad telligence,", "citeRegEx": "Bacchus and Grove.,? \\Q1995\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bacchus and Grove.", "year": 1995}, {"title": "Utility indepen\u00ad dence in qualitative decision theory", "author": ["Fahiem Bacchus", "Adam Grove"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 1996}, {"title": "Reasoning with conditional ceteris paribus preference statements", "author": ["Craig Boutilier", "Ronen I.
