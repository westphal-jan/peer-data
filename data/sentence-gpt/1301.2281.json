An n-player game is given by an undirected graph on n nodes and a set of n local matrices. The interpretation is that the payoff to player i is determined entirely by the actions of player i and his neighbors in the graph, and thus the payoff matrix to player i is indexed only by these players i.e., the payoff matrix to player i is determined by the relative sums of the total sum of the total sum of those who will be in the real world (in addition to the sums of the total sum of those who will be in the real world) and the value of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of those who will be in the real world. So the sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of the total sum of", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:24:24 GMT  (1203kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2281v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"], ["v2", "Sun, 8 Mar 2015 01:31:51 GMT  (154kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2281v2", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["michael kearns", "michael l littman", "satinder singh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2281"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.2281.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Graphical Models for Game Theory", "authors": ["Michael Kearns", "Michael L.
