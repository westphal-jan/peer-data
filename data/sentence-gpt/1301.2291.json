The computational complexity of the architectures are compared on the LImited Memory Influence Diagram (LIMID): a diagram where only the requiste information for the computation of the optimal policies are depicted. Because the requsite information is explicitly represented in the LIMID the evaluation can take advantage of it, and significant savings in computational can be obtained. In this paper we show how the obtained savings is considerably increased when the computations performed on the LIMID is according to the Lazy Evaluation scheme.\n\n\n\n\nThe first paper summarizes the computational complexity of the architectures and their implications for the evaluation of influence diagrams.\nThe first paper shows the computational complexity of the architectures and their implications for the evaluation of influence diagrams.\nThe second paper shows the computational complexity of the architectures and their implications for the evaluation of influence diagrams.
