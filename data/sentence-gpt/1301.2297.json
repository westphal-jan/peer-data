We present a case study in the construction of a BN in anintelligent tutoring application, specifically decimal misconceptions about the NBN-derived NPN , a bigness application that could be built using BN data.In our experiment, we used BN to generate an automated and non-numerical dataset based on the data collected in the form of a numerical chart, and were able to generate a graph based on the NBN data collected in the form of a numeric chart.We found a statistically significant interaction between the data collected and the NBN (Supplementary Table S1). Although we did not have to take advantage of this effect, the data we gathered were very similar to the data collected in the first time, but not in the second time.In this article we will briefly explain the potential benefits of BN-based BN and the potential drawbacks of this type of model to the development of a successful BN model.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:25:34 GMT  (1123kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2297v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ann nicholson", "tal boneh", "tim wilkin", "kaye stacey", "liz sonenberg", "vicki steinle"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2297"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.2297.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Case Study in Knowledge Discovery and Elicitation in an Intelligent Tutoring Application", "authors": ["Ann Nicholson", "Tal Bonehf", "Tim Wilkinf", "Kaye Stacey", "Liz Sonenberg", "Vicki Steinlell"], "emails": [], "sections": null, "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "Most successful Bayesian network (BN) ap\u00ad plications to date have been built through knowledge elicitation from experts.
