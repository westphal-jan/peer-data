A graphical model is developed that represents the simultaneous evolution of tempo and rhythm and relates these hidden quantities to observations. The rhythm variables are discrete and the tempo and observation variables are continuous. Each model captures the recorded music events as one continuous variable, as defined in this article. When we compare these measurements in terms of harmonic pattern frequency, we find that the duration of the rhythm is significant for each variable, and that the total recorded music length has changed significantly since the first measure of the beat was recorded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rhythmic rhythm variables include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:26:12 GMT  (1287kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2306v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SD", "authors": ["christopher s raphael"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2306"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.2306.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Mixed Graphical Model for Rhythmic Parsing", "authors": ["Christopher Raphael"], "emails": ["raphael@math.umass.edu"], "sections": null, "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "A method is presented for the rhythmic pars\u00ad<lb>ing problem: Given a sequence of observed<lb>musical note onset times, we simultaneously<lb>estimate the corresponding notated rhythm<lb>and tempo process.
