We analyze the classes of structures that are equivalent relative to a stream of distributions produced by local changes, and devise algorithms that output graphical representations of these equivalence classes. We present experimental results, using simulated data, and examine the errors associated with detection of changes and recovery of structures in response to the changes in the underlying model (see Fig. 1). Our new algorithm achieves a similar accuracy in our experiments (Fig. 1). We used a 2.5-dimensional dataset that combines the two-dimensional distribution, consisting of a tree of 10 distributions (with an exponential-weighted distribution), with the following properties: 1) The distribution of the two-dimensional distribution (a) is consistent with the model in the first phase (i.e., that the distribution of the two-dimensional distribution is less likely to change as changes in the data are computed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:26:39 GMT  (1372kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2312v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jin tian", "judea pearl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2312"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.2312.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Causal Discovery from Changes", "authors": ["Jin Tian"], "emails": ["@cs."], "sections": null, "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "We propose a new method of discovering causal structures, based on the detection of local, spontaneous changes in the un\u00ad derlying data-generating model.
