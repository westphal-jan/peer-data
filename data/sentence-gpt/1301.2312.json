We analyze the classes of structures that are equivalent relative to a stream of distributions produced by local changes, and devise algorithms that output graphical representations of these equivalence classes. We present experimental results, using simulated data, and examine the errors associated with detection of changes and recovery of structures. As such, the model can be evaluated in a way that is not easily interpreted in a natural way, at least in the real world. We have chosen a model with a particular focus on the causal structure. The model was selected to be one of the first to be used with statistical techniques, because it uses a single model (see Section). We propose a method to observe the association between data-generating models and models for the same period of time in real-world data-generating models. We describe the model as an example of a model in which an input variable is a causal structure with a causal structure. This model is not a purely linear model. We demonstrate the model to be used in natural statistics. In addition to having an empirical model, we provide a computational model to be used to model statistical data-generating models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:26:39 GMT  (1372kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2312v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jin tian", "judea pearl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2312"}, "pdf": {"name": "1301.2312.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Causal Discovery from Changes", "authors": ["Jin Tian"], "emails": ["@cs."], "sections": null, "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "We propose a new method of discovering causal structures, based on the detection of local, spontaneous changes in the un\u00ad derlying data-generating model.
