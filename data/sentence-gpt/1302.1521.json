An efficient and incremental implementation is outlined which depends on cost functions satisfying certain criteria. Possibilistic logic and probability theory (as it is used in the applications targetted) satisfy these criteria.\n\n\n\n\nThe models are described using an independent approach:\n1. The system generates its function (if there is a parameter) and then calculates a parameter in a subset of the parameters. The model then creates a model for each parameter, in the case of an underlying computation.\n2. The models are tested for the following tasks:\n2. The algorithm is tested for a certain kind of functional model that is not the best fit for the model.\n3. The model is run to generate a set of parameters.\n4. The model generates its function (if there is a parameter) and then calculates a parameter in the same way as that of any other computational model.\n5. The model generates its function (if there is a parameter) and then generates a parameter in the same way as that of any other computational model.
