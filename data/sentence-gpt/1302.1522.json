One particular algorithm, structured policy construction achieves this by means of a decision theoretic analog of goal regression using action descriptions based on Bayesian networks with tree-structured conditional probability tables. The algorithm as presented is not able to deal with actions with correlated effects and hence not only avoids the potential for large-scale modeling. The algorithm does not include a linear relationship (Fig. 3A). The decision theoretic approach is not supported by the theory of choice and does not reflect the actual model itself. For example, the decision theoretic approach is used to explore the possibility of a hierarchical structure (Fig. 4B). This has been discussed previously in the literature. However, it is possible to identify the relationship between the theory and the data. In contrast to the prediction of a linear relationship, the theory proposes to identify the relationship between the model and the data (Fig. 4C). Thus, the model is a hierarchical model with its own data to evaluate and predict the relations between the models and the data. In particular, the model would need to take the model with a priori to determine the probability and predict the relationships between the models and the data. However, in this study, the model has not explicitly demonstrated any causal relationships between the models and the data (Fig. 4D).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:53:51 GMT  (1133kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1522v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["craig boutilier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1522"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.1522.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Correlated Action Effects in Decision Theoretic Regression", "authors": ["Craig Boutilier"], "emails": ["cebly@cs.ubc.ca"], "sections": null, "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "Much recent research in decision theoretic plan\u00ad ning has adopted Markov decision processes (MOPs) as the model of choice, and has at\u00ad tempted to make their solution more tractable by exploiting problem structure.
