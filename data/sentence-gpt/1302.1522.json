One particular algorithm, structured policy construction achieves this by means of a decision theoretic analog of goal regression using action descriptions based on Bayesian networks with tree-structured conditional probability tables. The algorithm as presented is not able to deal with actions with correlated effects. We describe a new decision theoretic regression operator that corrects this weakness. While conceptually straightforward, this extension requires a somewhat more complicated technical approach. One of the most widely used approaches is the Bayesian Babbage model (and a well-known field in computer modeling which involves a lot of different assumptions) which attempts to work out a way for users to predict behavior across various classes of behavior. Babbage has shown that one step toward developing a robust decision theoretic model is to have a method that will be used in the real world, or even a model that can easily be used to predict behavior across any given set of parameters. As we see, the most recent Babbage model also relies upon Bayesian Babbage, which is a framework to work with the current development of such models (including several of the most recent Babbage model) to develop a method that allows users to predict behavior across any class of behavior.\n\n\nThere have been a number of controversies surrounding the Bayesian Babbage model that have caused a number of problems. Some concerns remain over what is really involved with the Babbage model. Some critics claim that the method uses two Bayesian Babbage methods. These claims are based on a model of decision planning that has a simple and flexible nature, and are based on a set of rules and principles that are not very easily explained by the Babbage model. In fact, some critics claim that the method uses two Bayesian Babbage methods. For example, we have to construct a model that gives users a choice of whether to change the way the user would feel about the behavior of all three of its parameters and the choice of what is acceptable and what is right. However, there are several ways to approach the Babbage model. One is to simply build a model that gives users a choice of how to choose between which parameters they want to modify, how to change what is acceptable, and how they would change the behavior of the behavior of the behavior of the behavior of the behavior of the behavior of the behavior of the behavior of the behavior of the behavior of", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:53:51 GMT  (1133kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1522v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["craig boutilier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1522"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.1522.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Correlated Action Effects in Decision Theoretic Regression", "authors": ["Craig Boutilier"], "emails": ["cebly@cs.ubc.ca"], "sections": null, "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "Much recent research in decision theoretic plan\u00ad ning has adopted Markov decision processes (MOPs) as the model of choice, and has at\u00ad tempted to make their solution more tractable by exploiting problem structure.
