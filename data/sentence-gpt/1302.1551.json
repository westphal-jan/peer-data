The preliminary results suggest that the probabilistic models allowing for effective computational procedures are represented by sequences possessing a special property; we shall call them perfect sequences. The paper lays down the elementary foundation necessary for further study of iterative application of operators of composition. We believe to develop a technique describing several graph models in a unifying way. We are convinced that practically all theoretical results and procedures connected with decomposable models and Bayesian networks can be translated into the terminology introduced in this paper. For example, complexity of computational procedures in these models is closely dependent on possibility to change the ordering of oligo-dimensional measures defining the model. Therefore, in this paper, lot of attention is paid to possibility to change ordering of the operators of composition. To illustrate the basic problem of computation, the graph models are often used to describe the function of operations (e.g., function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function of function", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:57:13 GMT  (1062kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1551v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["radim jirousek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1551"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.1551.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Composition of Probability Measures on Finite Spaces", "authors": ["Radim Jirou!!ek"], "emails": ["radim@vse.cz"], "sections": null, "references": [{"title": "-divergence geometry of proba\u00ad bility distributions and minimization problems", "author": ["I.
