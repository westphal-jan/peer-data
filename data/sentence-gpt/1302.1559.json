{"id": "1302.1559", "review": {"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "6-Feb-2013", "title": "Incremental Map Generation by Low Cost Robots Based on Possibility/Necessity Grids", "abstract": "In this paper we present some results obtained with a troupe of low-cost robots designed to cooperatively explore and adquire the map of unknown structured orthogonal environments. In order to improve the covering of the explored zone, the robots show different behaviours and cooperate by transferring each other the perceived environment when they meet. The returning robots deliver to a host computer their partial maps and the host incrementally generates the map of the environment by means of apossibility/ necessity grid grid coordinates. In addition, they show the amount of space their environment occupies during the exploration process. These results are of great interest in the design and simulation of the geometrically and physically distinct environment of the robot. The results show that the human robots have the most resources in the world and can travel to any given location using the free and flexible model of the model. In addition, they are highly useful in the application of the low cost robot.\n\n\n\n\nThe study involved the team from UC Berkeley and UC Santa Barbara. They found that their average cost of autonomous driving in the US in 2018 was around $6,000/year and was the top cost at least on the US scale. The goal is to provide the best of both worlds with high quality autonomous driving services.\nThis study is supported by the US Department of Agriculture\u2021s \u201cPublic Health Research Program in the United States and the US Federal Aviation Administration\u2021s \u201cPublic Health Research Program\u2021s and the National Institute of Health and Human Development\u2021s \u201cThe World Health Organization\u2021s \u201cInternational Affairs Research Program\u2021s and the National Institute of Health and Human Development\u2021s \u201cThe European Society for Human Health\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s\u2021s", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:58:12 GMT  (1120kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1559v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["maite lopez-sanchez", "ramon lopez de mantaras", "carles sierra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1559"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.1559.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Incremental map generation by low cost robots based on possibility/necessity grids", "authors": ["Maite Lopez-Sanchez", "R.
