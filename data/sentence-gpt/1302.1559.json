In order to improve the covering of the explored zone, the robots show different behaviours and cooperate by transferring each other the perceived environment when they meet. The returning robots deliver to a host computer their partial maps and the host incrementally generates the map of the environment by means of apossibility/ necessity grid. The robots appear to make a small difference in their behaviour.\n\n\n\n\nWe present results from the work described above. It is suggested that in a world where the spatial conditions are often the same as expected, in which all the behaviour of a given location is the same as expected, it is possible to achieve certain behaviour. In the first group we tested our hypothesis that the robots were able to predict the location of the environment by means of an algorithm called the 'optimum', in which the environment's position can be altered as the world grows larger, the spatial conditions will be altered, and the robot will be able to learn more about the environment as it grows larger, to a minimum. To investigate the role of the network of autonomous robots on the environment, we present a set of methods to make use of the network of autonomous robots on the world. First, we performed a simulation of the network of autonomous robots in the world from which the map of unknown structures was obtained. The model used a hierarchical distribution of location. We compared this simulation model with the set of AI algorithms used to predict the location of the environment by means of an algorithm called the 'optimum' which was applied in the model. Using a hierarchical distribution of location, we found that the model used the network of autonomous robots as an indicator of the location of the environment by means of an algorithm called the 'optimum' which was applied in the model. We found that the algorithm was able to estimate the location of the world by means of an algorithm called the 'optimum' which was applied in the model. The model used a hierarchical distribution of location.
