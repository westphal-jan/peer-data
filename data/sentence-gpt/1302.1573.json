POMDPs are difficult to solve. This paper identifies a subclass of POMDPs called region observable POMDPs, which are easier to solve and can be used to approximate general POMDPs to arbitrary accuracy. The implementation of these POMDPs in stochastic domain models requires a series of steps, including the need to obtain a stochastic model of a specific region to provide optimal statistical accuracy. The method of obtaining these POMDPs to identify regions for the POMDPs using the standard methods is described in the paper. This method allows researchers to estimate the POMDPs using the standard methods.\n\n\n\nThe method used to generate POMDPs and to derive POMDPs using the standard methods is described in the paper.

The POMDP can also be used to define a set of known POMDP parameters.\nTo obtain POMDPs based on the POMDPs using the standard methods, it is possible to use POMDPs based on the standard methods. However, a method that performs these POMDPs has to be chosen from a set of known POMDP parameters.\nFor example, a method that performs these POMDPs requires a set of known POMDP parameters.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:59:30 GMT  (1407kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1573v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nevin lianwen zhang", "wenju liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1573"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.1573.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Region-Based Approximations for Planning in Stochastic Domains", "authors": ["Nevin L.
