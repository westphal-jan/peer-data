It is also possible to construct more abstracted, hierarchical structures based on language learning.\n\n\n\nIn the text, an overview of the proposed structure is posted here.\nAs a background, this is the project of Eric Heilman, the author and CTO of the book, \"On the Way to the World of Open Language\".

Such networks may also be used to identify unconventional text components, such as collocations, supra-phrasal units [1], as well as for finding similar fragments in different texts [2].\nThere is a multitude of approaches to constructing networks from the texts\n(so-called language networks) and different ways of interpreting nodes and links, which causes, accordingly, different representation of such networks. Nodes are connected if corresponding words are either adjacent in the text [3, 4], or are in a single sentence [5], or are syntactically [6, 7] or semantically [8, 9] connected.\nAt the intersection of digital signal processing (DSP) theory and complex\nnetwork theory there are several ways of constructing networks from the time series, among those are visibility graph construction methods (see survey [10]), namely the horizontal visibility graph (HVG) [11,12]. Based on these approaches, networks can also be constructed from texts in which numeric values are assigned in some manner to each word or phrase. The examples of functions assigning a number to a word are: ordinal number of a unique word in a text, length of the word, \u201cweight\u201d of the word in a text, e.g., generally accepted TFIDF metric (canonically, a product of the term frequency in a text fragment and a\nbinary logarithm of the inverse number of text fragments containing this word \u2013 inverse document frequency) or its modifications [13, 14] and other word weight estimates.\nIn this paper, the standard deviation estimate of word weight is used for\nconstructing word networks [15]. If all the words in the text of N words are numbered in succession (let 1,...n N= be the ordinal number of the word in a text,\nthe word position), layout of a certain word A can be designated as ( )kA n , where 1,2,...,k K= denotes the number of occurrence of this word in a text, and n is a\nposition of this word in a text. For example, ( )3 50A means that the third occurrence of the word A has position 50 in the text.\nThe distance between successive occurrences of the word in these terms\nwould be ( ) ( )1k k kA A m A n m n+\u2206 = \u2212 = \u2212 , where m and n are the positions of the 1k + - th k -th occurrences of the word A in the text, respectively.\nStandard deviation estimate proposed in [15] is calculated as follows:\n22\nA\nA A\nA \u03c3\n\u2206 \u2212 \u2206 =\n\u2206 , (1)\nwhere A\u2206 is a mean value of the sequence 1 2, ,..., KA A A\u2206 \u2206 \u2206 , 2A\u2206 is a mean value\nof 2 2 21 2, ,..., KA A A\u2206 \u2206 \u2206 , and K is a number of occurrences of the word A in the text.\nAs opposed to other series examined in DSP theory, the series of numerical\nvalues assigned to words are transformed into horizontal visibility graphs (HVG), where each node not only has a corresponding numerical value, but also the corresponding word itself.\nThe process of constructing the language network using HVG consists of two\nstages. At the first stage, the traditional HVG is constructed [16]. To do that a series of nodes is put on the horizontal axis, where each node corresponds to a word in order of occurrence in the text, and standard deviation estimates are put on the vertical axis (visually a histogram, see fig. 1). There is a connection between nodes if they are in \u201cline of sight\u201d with each other, i.e., if they can be connected by a horizontal line that does not cross any other histogram bar. This\n(geometric) criterion can be written down as follows, according to [10,11]: the two nodes (words), e.g., ( )3B n and ( )7 5C m n= + , are connected if (see fig. 1)\n,n m p\u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3> , for all n p m< < . (2)\nThe process of constructing can be algorithmized. For example, in figure 1\nthe word node ( )1 2A n + is considered incident (and is connected with edges) to the words ( )3B n and ( )1 5C n + , ( )3B n being the closest word to the left of ( )1 2A n + with\na standard deviation estimate n B\u03c3 = \u03c3 greater than that of the word \u0410: 2n A+\u03c3 = \u03c3 , and ( )7 5C m n= + being the closest word to the right of ( )1 2A n + , for which m A\u03c3 > \u03c3 .\nAt the second stage, the derived network is compactified. All the nodes\ncorresponding to a single word, e.g., the word A , are combined into a single node (naturally, occurrence numbers and positions of the words are lost). The connections of theses nodes are also combined. Note that there is no more than one edge left between any pair of nodes, multiple connections are removed (see fig. 2).\nThis means, in particular, that the degree (number of connections) of the\nnode A does not exceed the sum of degrees ( )k k A n\u2211 . As a result, the new network of words \u2013 compactified horizontal visibility graph (CHVG) \u2013 is constructed (fig. 2).\nTexts used for CHVG construction were the novels \u201cThe Master and\nMargarita\u201d (original version) by Mikhail Bulgakov and \u201cMoby-Dick; or, The Whale\u201d by Herman Melville, as well as arrays of news information from the Web.\nFor all CHVG networks of words described here, the degree distribution is\nclose to power law (fig. 3), i.e., these networks are scale free.\nFor comparison, was studied for the simplest language networks, where\nduring the first stage of the network construction adjacent words were connected, and, at the second stage, the network was compactified. It is obvious that the weight of a node in such network corresponds to the word frequency, and the distribution of these weights follows the Zipf law [18]. The most connected are the nodes corresponding to the most frequently occurring words \u2013 conjunctions, prepositions, etc., which are very important for the text coherence, but are of little interest for the aspect of informational structure.\nAmong the nodes with largest degrees, alongside with personal pronouns\nand other function words (particles, prepositions, conjunctions, etc.), are the words, which determine the informational structure of the text [16, 17].\nLet \u03a8 be a set of N different words (in our case N = 100) corresponding to the\nlargest-weight nodes of the aforementioned simple language network, and let \u039bbe a set of words corresponding to the largest-weight nodes of the CHVG. Then the set \\\u2126 = \u039b \u03a8will contain informational words, which are also important for the text coherence. Appendix gives juxtaposition of the top 100 largest-weight nodes for the two types of language networks constructed from the novels \u201cThe Master and Margarita\u201d by Michael Bulgakov and \u201cMoby-Dick; or, The Whale\u201d by Herman Melville.\nIn particular, the \u2126 set of the CHVG built from \u201c\u041c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u0438 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u201d\ncontains such words as \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d, \u041c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440, \u0412\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0445\u0430, \u0411\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0437, \u0411\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0442, \u0420\u0438\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0440, \u041b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0439, \u0418\u0435\u0448\u0443\u0430.\nThe following results were obtained from studying the language networks:\n1. An algorithm compactified horizontal visibility graph (CHVG) was\nproposed.\n2. Language networks were built from different texts based on series of\nstandard deviation estimates and CHVG.\n3. In CHVG obtained from literary works, among the largest-degree nodes\nthere are words responsible not only for the coherence of the text, but also for its informational structure. They reflect the meaning of the mentioned texts.\nReferences\n1. Dijk van T.A. Text and Context: Explorations in the Semantics and Pragmatics of Discourse. \u2013 London: Longman. \u2013357 p.
