This method is useful in the determination of biological molecular structure. It is limited, however, by the requirement that the uncertainty in the constraints be normally distributed and that the uncertainty is constrained. This approach, using a simple constraint (BMI) that is derived from a nonlinear and nonlinear equation, was initially developed as a way to predict the distances from a distance from the source of the origin of the coordinate. However, this technique is not the only technique that can provide an adequate predictive approach to predict the distances between the origin and origin of the coordinates.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:13:22 GMT  (828kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6780v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["russ b altman", "cheng c chen", "william b poland", "jaswinder pal singh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6780"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6780.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Probabilistic Constraint Satisfaction with Non-Gaussian Noise", "authors": ["Russ B.

This method is useful in the determination of biological molecular structure. It is limited, however, by the requirement that the uncertainty in the constraints be normally distributed. In this paper, we present an extension of the original algorithm that allows constraint uncertainty to be represented as a mixture of Gaussians, and thereby allows arbitrary constraint distributions. We illustrate the performance of this algorithm on a problem drawn from the domain of molecular structure determination, in which a multicomponent constraint representation produces a much more accurate solution than the old single component mechanism. The new mechanism uses mixture distributions to decompose the problem into a set of independent problems with unimodal constraint uncertainty. The results of the unimodal subproblems are periodically recombined using Bayes' law, to avoid combinatorial explosion. The new algorithm is particularly suited for parallel", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
