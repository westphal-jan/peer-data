Experiments have shown that likelihood weighting is one of the most promising simulation schemes. In this paper, we present a new simulation scheme that generates samples more evenly spread in the sample space than the likelihood weighting scheme. We show both theoretically and experimentally that the stratified scheme outperforms likelihood weighting in average runtime and error in estimates of beliefs. Using a simple linear model, we simulate a Bayesian model that allows the probability of errors in the confidence of the predictions for each case, and then assess how much confidence the probability of error can be derived from the predicted prediction for each case.\n\n\n\n\nThe predictions for Bayesian beliefs were presented as probabilities from an approximate (nearly zero) value, and the predictions for the distributions were derived from a probability weighting procedure (see Methods ). The Bayesian models have been used extensively in modeling prediction networks, including Gaussian model (FAN) and Simikova model (SIMI).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:14:37 GMT  (1004kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6793v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["remco r bouckaert"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6793"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6793.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Bayesian Belief Networks", "authors": ["Remco R.
