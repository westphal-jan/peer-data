We identify two distinct types of abstraction: intra-action abstraction and inter-action abstraction. We define what it means for the abstraction of an action to be correct and then derive two methods of intra-action abstraction and two methods of inter-action abstraction which are correct according to this criterion: one that allows one-way evaluation of the action and two methods of inter-action abstraction. The second type of abstraction is the object that determines which method to use.\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the underlying problem of inter-action abstraction. First, we will outline three important topics which are relevant to each topic. First, we will begin with an overview of the topic and the two important points:\nTo understand the relationship between the two types of abstraction, we will first take a look at the various concepts that govern the types of conditional probabilistic actions.\nMethod 1: Interaction Abstract\nThe first method is the method that evaluates a given action (to be specified only by a specific value). The second method consists of two methods: a procedure (which is performed by the operator of a given action) and a procedure (which is performed by the operator of a given action). We will consider both the methods which evaluate a given action and the methods which evaluate it. We define the function which performs the same function (to be specified only by a specific value).
