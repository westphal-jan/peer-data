We identify two distinct types of abstraction: intra-action abstraction and inter-action abstraction. We define what it means for the abstraction of an action to be correct and then derive two methods of intra-action abstraction and two methods of inter-action abstraction which are correct according to this criterion. We illustrate the developed techniques by applying them to actions described with the temporal action representation used in the DRIPS decision-theoretic planner and we describe how the planner uses abstraction to reduce the complexity of planning.\n\n\n\n\nA paper discussing the problem of abstracting conditional probabilistic action was presented to the editor of the paper, Robert H. Schulz. The paper was presented to the journal Nature.\nReferences\n\nBibliographic information\nKolinska, A.J. et al. (2016).

The paper also mentions the problems of inter-action and inter-action, and mentions the technical details of the system, and also mentions the general principles of a distributed system.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:16:31 GMT  (985kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6812v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["peter haddawy", "anhai doan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6812"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6812.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Abstracting Probabilistic Actions", "authors": ["Peter Haddawy", "AnHai Doan"], "emails": ["@cs."], "sections": null, "references": [{"title": "Abstract probabilis\u00ad tic modeling of action", "author": ["L.
