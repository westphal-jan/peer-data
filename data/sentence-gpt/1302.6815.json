The algorithms have two components: a scoring metric and a search procedure. The scoring metric takes a network structure, statistical data, and a user's prior knowledge, and returns a score proportional to the posterior probability of the network structure given the data set. The algorithm generates an algorithm that is very similar to a Bayesian network, using the following function, which is called in this function. The algorithm generates a scoring model that is similar to a Bayesian network, which generates a score proportional to the posterior probability of the network structure given the data set. If a network has more than one million users, then the result is that a network has a larger likelihood of being ranked or ranked with the lowest number of users (assuming a maximum of 25 percent of all users). When a model is used in a certain way, it is likely that the average user will be ranked more or less by the algorithm, because the algorithm provides an optimal scoring system.\n\n\n\nThis article is intended to be an overview of the algorithm used in this article. The algorithm can be used to measure neural networks or computer networks. A good comparison of the algorithm can be found in the results section.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:16:50 GMT  (1221kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6815v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"], ["v2", "Sat, 16 May 2015 23:46:48 GMT  (183kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6815v2", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david heckerman", "dan geiger", "david maxwell chickering"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6815"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6815.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Learning Bayesian Networks: The Combination of Knowledge and Statistical Data", "authors": ["David Heckerman", "Dan Geiger"], "emails": ["heckerma@microsoft.com,", "dang@cs.technion.ac.il,", "dmax@cs.ucla.edu"], "sections": null, "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "We describe scoring metrics for learning Bayesian networks from a combination of user knowledge and statistical data. We identify two important properties of metrics, which we call event equivalence and parame\u00ad ter modularity. These properties have been mostly ignored, but when combined, greatly simplify the encoding of a user's prior knowl\u00ad edge. In particular, a user can express his knowledge-for the most part-as a single prior Bayesian network for the domain.", "creator": "pdftk 1.41 - www.pdftk.com"}}}
