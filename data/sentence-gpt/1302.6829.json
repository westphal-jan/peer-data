The concept of spatial template is introduced to capture the idea of interrelated objects in two\u00ad dimensional space. The representation model is used to specify imprecise or vague information consisting in relative locations and orientations of template objects. It is shown in this paper how a template represented by this model can be matched against a crisp situation to recognize a particular instance of this template. Furthermore, the proximity measure (fuzzy measure) between the instance and the template is worked out this measure can be interpreted as a degree of similarity. In this context, template recognition can be viewed as a case of fuzzy pattern recognition.
