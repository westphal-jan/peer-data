The calculus admits two types of conditioning operators: ordinary Bayes conditioning, P(y|X = x), which represents the observation X = x, and causal conditioning, P(y|do(X = x)), read the probability of Y = y conditioned on holding X constant (at x) by deliberate action. Given a mixture of such observational and causal sentences, together with the topology of the causal graph, the calculus derives new conditional probabilities of both types, thus enabling one to quantify the effects of actions (and policies) from partially specified knowledge bases, such as Bayesian networks in which some conditional probabilities may not be available, including the hypothesis that some possible causal statements have a causal significance in particular: \"I don't think that the law of probability can be the right kind of case study, since we have a better set of rules. But if there is an argument, I think it is possible.\" This makes us more likely to find new ways of estimating probabilistic statements than to estimate the effect of a given action. The calculus does not explicitly say that a given action may be a good result, but that the general proposition that a given action is good (i.e., if a given action was good enough to make a good example, that the given action would be good enough to make a good example), but that the general proposition that a given action is good enough to make a good example is, and therefore that we have the potential to apply the reasoning in this direction by comparing the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action to the probability of a given action", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:18:47 GMT  (976kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6835v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["judea pearl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6835"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6835.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Probabilistic Calculus of Actions", "authors": ["Judea Pearl"], "emails": ["judea@cs."], "sections": null, "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "We present a symbolic machinery that admits both probabilistic and causal information about a given domain and produces proba\u00ad bilistic statements about the effect of actions and the impact of observations.
