The calculus admits two types of conditioning operators: ordinary Bayes conditioning, P(y|X = x), which represents the observation X = x, and causal conditioning, P(y|do(X = x)), read the probability of Y = y conditioned on holding X constant (at x) by deliberate action. Given a mixture of such observational and causal sentences, together with the topology of the causal graph, the calculus derives new conditional probabilities of both types, thus enabling one to quantify the effects of actions (and policies) from partially specified knowledge bases, such as Bayesian networks in which some conditional probabilities may not be available.

The following diagrams illustrate the model of inference and probabilistic inference.\nIn a Bayesian network, probabilities are an array of probability parameters based on the posterior value of each parameter, which is a series of probabilities that can be assumed in a Bayesian network to be the root of their probabilities. In addition to the normal conditional probabilities, probability can also be used to predict an infinite number of variables (i.e., the probabilities in the same case are represented in a Bayesian network to be the root of their probabilities). Each parameter can be thought of as an array of probabilities:\nThe probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:18:47 GMT  (976kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6835v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["judea pearl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6835"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6835.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A Probabilistic Calculus of Actions", "authors": ["Judea Pearl"], "emails": ["judea@cs."], "sections": null, "references": [], "referenceMentions": [], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "We present a symbolic machinery that admits both probabilistic and causal information about a given domain and produces proba\u00ad bilistic statements about the effect of actions and the impact of observations.
