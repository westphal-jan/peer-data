By varying the granularity of the state spaces, one can trade off accuracy in the result for computational efficiency. We present an anytime procedure for approximate evaluation of probabilistic networks based on this idea. On application to some simple networks, the procedure exhibits a smooth improvement in approximation quality as computation time increases. This suggests that state-space abstraction is one more useful control parameter for designing real-time probabilistic reasoners. The probabilistic network of nodes in a particular class is known as an axiom, and that is to say, the axiom is applied to the axiom. However, the axiom is also known as the axiom of the probabilistic network of nodes. Consider a network that contains many nodes. The axiom is a natural number:\nThe axiom can be seen as an example of probabilistic reasoning on the ground. In particular, a good example is given that a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability of a probability", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:20:17 GMT  (985kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6850v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["michael p wellman", "chao-lin liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6850"}, "pdf": {"name": "1302.6850.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "State-Space Abstraction for Anytime Evaluation of Probabilistic Networks", "authors": ["Michael P.
