The dynamic decision-modeling ap proach in KBDS advocates that the decision mod els for different problems should be dynamically con structed from a knowledge base [Breese, 1989, Well man, 1990a]. This approach facilitates scalability and reusability of the knowledge bases. Moreover, the re sulting decision models are context-sensitive and in clude only the relevant information specific to the problems. To date, however, while much progress has been made in improving the algorithms for manipulat ing decision models, the automated model construc tion process remains to be formalized.\nThis paper characterizes the knowledge for supporting dynamic decision-modeling in medicine. Character izing such knowledge illuminates the representational and computational requirements for automating deci sion analysis in a broad domain. Unlike previous ef forts, instead of concentrating on the structural com ponents of the decision model such as nodes, condi tional probabilities, and influences, we focus on the ontological features of the decision problem such as contexts, classes of observed events, classes of available actions, classes of possible outcomes, temporal prece dence, and probabilistic and contextual dependencies.\nBy gaining insights into the nature of decisions, this exercise serves as a step toward developing a formal methodology for requirement analysis and realizing a uniform representation framework for supporting dy namic decision-modeling in KBDS.\nThe following discussions are based on the general sys tem architecture depicted in Figure 1. Given a prob lem description, the planner or decision-maker con structs a decision model by accessing information con tained in the knowledge base. The domain and the decision-analytic components of the knowledge base are integrated by the knowledge-base manager, which also serves as an interface to the planner.\nThe decision models considered are qualitative prob abilistic networks (QPNs) [Wellman, 1990b). Since QPNs are the qualitative variants of influence dia grams, and since each influence diagram can be trans formed into a decision tree, our results are expected to be generalizable to other decision models.\nIn the subsequent sections, we present a medical de cision problem and examine the reasoning and rep resentational issues involved in the decision analysis process. Some ideas on integrating context-sensitive categorical and uncertain knowledge will be explored and compared to relevant representation frameworks.\nRepresentation Requirements for Supporting Decision Model furmulation 213\n2 An Example\nA simplified medical decision rroblem (Beck and Pauker, 1981, Tsevat et al., 1989 is shown below: The patient is an 80 year-old woman. She complained of fainting and was found to have irregular heartbeats, or arrythmia. A diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, i.e., dis order of the heart muscles was made. Such a disorder usually leads to embolism, or formation of blood clots in the patient's body. The problem is to determine if anticoagulant therapy should be administered to reduce the chance of embolism, given the high risk of bleeding complications in the elderly.\nEach relevant event in the decision problem can be re garded as a concept, e.g., SO-year-old, cardiomyopathy, anticoagulant-therapy, etc. A concept is an event or a random variable in the probabilistic sense; it denotes an abstract description of an object, an attribute, a state of being or a process, depending on the circum stances.\n3 The Decision Making Process\nGiven a set of input concepts, the goal for the proposed KBDS is to construct a decision model such as the one shown in Figure 2, and then evaluate the feasibility of the alternatives with respect to some criteria,e.g., life expectancy, expected monetary value, etc.\nMore formally, the decision-analytic approach to de cision making can be viewed as a five-step process: 1) Background characterization; 2) context establish ment; 3) problem formulation; 4) model construction; and 5) Model evaluation.\n3.1 Background Information Characterization\nThe process begins by classifying the input concepts into the variables concerned, the actions available, and the possible outcomes involved in a decision problem. In the clinical setting, the input concepts can usually be divided into six categories, as shown in Table 1 for our example.\nThe planner can characterize each input concept by asking questions like:\n\u2022 Is fainting a kind of sign or symptom?\n\u2022 Is cardiomyopathy a kind of disease?\nTo answer the above queries, the knowledge-base must support categorizations of the relevant domain con cepts. A categorization is a grouping of concepts with similar descriptions in a particular dimension. Ex amples of such groupings include those induced by the specialization (AKO) relation, the decomposition (PARTOF) relation, etc.\nThe characterized background information, however, is insufficient for formulating a decision model. For instance, in our example, the relationships among the input concepts are not explicitly stated, the two rel evant kinds of embolism being considered, systemic and pulmonary embolisms, are not specified, and the evaluation criteria are not mentioned. The missing in formation, which may be related to the domain or the decision-analytic methodology, must be derived when necessary.\n3.2 Domain Context Establishment\nEstablishing the context 1 means defining the task en vironment in which the problem is to be solved. This enables different problem situations to be considered and sets limits on the possible operations that can be applied to a given problem [Kassirer and Kopelman, 1987). The context is selected with only a few clues [Kassirer and Garry, 1978). In the clinical setting, a context is usually indicated by a suspected disease, a syndrome, i.e., a set of signs and symptoms that con vey special meanings, or a general diagnostic category, e.g., an acute respiratory disorder [Kassirer and Kopel man, 1987). In our example, the clinical context is \"cardiomyopa thy in old-age.\" This context is established by iden tifying the suspected diseases and any conditions that might significantly affect their nature.\nGiven the characterized background information, iden tifying the suspected diseases simply involves looking them up in the set of input concepts. For now, we as sume that other significant conditions, e.g., old-age in our example, are specified by an oracle. Recognizing these conditions automatically requires a very sophis ticated planner, and the issues involved are outside the scope of this paper.\nThe main purpose of establishing a context is to al-\n1 This is different from the decision context [Breese, 1989, Holtzman, 1989] which refers to all the assumptions, constraints, variables, and alternatives considered in the decision problem.\n214 Leong\nFigure 2: A QPN For The Example\nlow access to the context-sensitive information. For instance, in older patients, cardiomyopathy may have different manifestations and more severe complications than in younger patients, or in the presence of other diseases. Therefore, such context-sensitive knowledge must be expressible in the knowledge base.\n3.3 Decision Problem Formulation\nGuided by the characterized background information, a decision problem is formulated within the domain context by identifying:\n\u2022 all or the most important diseases/hypotheses that may be involved;\n\u2022 the relative significance of all these concepts;\n\u2022 all or the most important possible outcomes/ complications of these concepts;\n\u2022 all or the most important actions available;\n\u2022 the effects of the actions on the concepts and their outcomes and possible complications; and\n\u2022 the evaluation criteria.\nTable 2 shows all the relevant concepts in our exam ple. \"Pulmonary embolism\" and \"systemic embolism\" are among the values of the corresponding \"embolism\" node in Figure 2.\nTo answer the above queries, the knowledge base must, in addition to supporting categorizations of the domain concepts, allow expression of the inter actions, i.e., the correlational/influential/causal rela tions, among these concepts. The varying degrees of significance for all these relations in different con-\nRepresentation Requirements for Supporting Decision Model furmulation 215\ntexts must also be expressible in the knowledge base. This, together with the varying degrees of temporal and probabilistic dependencies among the interactions, would facilitate derivation of the most relevant infor mation for the problem at hand.\n3.4 Decision Model Construction\nAs mentioned, a decision model for our example is shown in Figure 2.\nTo construct such a decision model, its structure, e.g., nodes and links in a QPN, and its preference model, e.g., evaluation criteria such as morbidity, mortality, and monetary costs associated with utilities, must be inferrable from the knowledge base. The temporal con straints on the decision model structure, i.e., the or der in which the concepts and their consequences are to be considered, should also be inferrable from the interactions of the underlying concepts. Hence, the construction involves asking questions like:\n\u2022 How are the observable effects of the alternatives relate to the chance events?\n\u2022 What are the outcomes that affect the evaluation criteria?\nTo support these queries, the relevant interactions among the concepts must be expressible in the knowl edge base. These interactions involve both domain concepts and decision-analytic concepts, e.g., \"pres ence of disease positively-influences morbidity.\"\n3.5 Decision Model Evaluation\nUpon completion, the decision model is evaluated by some procedure with respect to the evaluation criteria. Here, evaluation of a decision model refers to solving the model with procedures such as folding back of a decision tree, or graph reduction of a QPN. The eval uation criterion assumed in our example is quality adjusted life expectancy, i.e., a measure of time re maining in a patient's life, taking into account the in conveniences caused by the illness (morbidity). Given a well-formed decision model, only procedural knowl edge is needed in this step.\n4 Summary of Inference Patterns and Representation Requirements\nThe above analysis shows that four types of general inference patterns are involved in the automated deci sion analysis process:\n\u2022 (Ql) Does concept A related to concept B in 0\n\u2022 (Q2) What are the concepts related to concept A in 0?\n\u2022 (Q3) Does concept A relate to concept B by i?\n\u2022 (Q4) What are the concepts related to concept A by i?\nwhere 0 is a categorization and i is an interaction.\nThree types of knowledge are required to support these inferences: categorical knowledge, uncertain knowl edge, and a notion of \"context.\"\n4.1 Categorical Knowledge\nThe categorical knowledge captures the definitional or structural relations of the concepts, allowing expres sion of facts such as: \"cardiomyopathy is a kind of disease\" and \"pulmonary embolism is a kind of em bolism.\" This type of knowledge should provide the system with the power of abstraction and inheritance. In other words, knowing a class of concepts would al low the planner to derive its subclasses, and vice versa. Furthermore, the generic description for a class of con cepts can be specified at an appropriate level of ab straction; portions of this description can be inherita ble by its subclasses or superclasses.\n4.2 Uncertain Knowledge\nThe uncertain knowledge captures the interactions, i.e., the correlational, influential, or causal relations among the concepts, allowing expression of facts such as: \"presence of anticoagulant-therapy negatively influences presence of embolism\" and \"cardiomyopa thy causes arrythmia.\" This type of knowledge should provide the system with the power of differentiation by accommodating a spectrum of temporal and prob abilistic dependencies among the concepts. By com paring the relational strengths, the planner would be able to deduce the certainty and usefulness of the in formation derived from the knowledge base.\n4.3 A Contextual Notion\nIn addition to the categorical and uncertain knowl edge, a notion of \"context\" should be included in the knowledge base. This contextual notion has the fol lowing properties:\n1. It sets a boundary on the relevant categorical and uncertain knowledge, and can be regarded as a focusing mechanism. This enables the planner to look for different information in different sit uations. For instance, the old-age of a patient would lead to the focus on a particular set of com plications for cardiomyopathy and anticoagulant therapy.\n2. It allows differentiation of the relational signifi cance, both categorical and interactional, among a set of concepts; the relative relevance and im portance of the information can thus be dis tinguished in different situations. For example,\n216 Leong\nbleeding is the most important complication of anticoagulant-therapy in the context of cardiomy opathy in old-age.\n3. It is compositional and can be defined hierarchi cally. In other words, multiple, interacting con texts may coexist and a context can be defined within another context. For example, \"cardiomy opathy\" and \"old-age\" combine to form the con text of \"cardiomyopathy in old-age\"; the latter, in turn, is a subcontext of \"disease in old-age.\"\n5 A Representation Design\nWe now propose a representation design that would meet the requirements for supporting the inferences Ql-Q4 in a context-sensitive manner.\n5.1 Representation of Concepts\nIn our framework, a concept is an intensional descrip tion of the relational interpretation of an object, a state, a process, or an attribute of these phenom ena. In other words, a concept reflects the salient features of the underlying phenomenon through a set of interactions with other concepts. These rel evant concepts are called the properties of the con cept being described. For example, the description of the concept disease2 includes properties such as severity, manifestation, and treatment, as well as interactions such as \"presence-of-disease causes presence-of-manifestation-of-disease\" and ''presence-of-treatment-of-disease negatively influences severity-of-disease.\"\n5.1.1 Properties of Concepts\nThe properties of a concept include its inherent qual ities, characteristics, and other relevant concepts that constitute its description e.g., size (of a tumor) and treatment (of a disease). Each property is a concept3 itself. Each property of a concept has a list of values, which are also concepts themselves.\nTo incorporate context-dependent information, a new concept can be derived from each prop erty of a concept. For example, the concept treatment-of-cardiomyopathy is derived from the property treatment of cardiomyopathy. This new derived-concept has a description constrained by the concept it is derived from; the two concepts are related by the context ( CXT) relation to be described below. Compositions of the CXT re lation enable \"chaining\" of the derived-concepts, e.g., duration-of-treatment-of-cardiomyopathy,\n2 All concepts defined in our framework will be refer enced in typevri ter type style.\n3 Referred to as property-concept from now on.\npresence-of-complications-oftreatment-of-cardiomyopathy, etc. , are concepts formable in this way.\nThe properties of a concept in this framework are analogous to the roles in term subsumption languages and the slots in frame-based languages. The dif ference is that the properties alone do not com pletely describe a concept; they serve only as in dices to the interactions that constitute the mean ing of a concept. These interactions are expressed in terms of the corresponding derived-concepts, e.g., \"duration-of-treatment-of-cardiomyopathy negatively-influences severity-of-cardiomyopathy is an interaction in the description of cardiomyopathy.\n5.1.2 Interactions of Concepts\nEach interaction between two concepts has two com ponents: temporal precedence, with \"known\" or \"un known\" as values, and qualitative probabilistic influ ence [Wellman, 1990b], with \"positive,\" \"negative,\" and \"unknown\" as values. The interactions can thus be expressed as four types of links in a network in terpretation of our framework: associational links, which denote probabilistic correlation with an un known type of influence and unknown temporal prece dence; precedence links, which denote temporal prece dence with unknown type of probabilistic influence; in fluential links, which denote conditional probabilistic dependencies; and causal/inhibitive links, which de note known temporal precedence in addition to known type of probabilistic influences.\n5.2 Categorization of Concepts\nThe description of a concept can be constrained by a set of categorizers. A categorizer is a categorical or class relationship; it is a binary relation that speci fies the properties and the interactions of a concept in terms of those of another concept. By imposing a par tial order on the related concepts, a categorizer estab lishes a unique perspective for describing each concept. For example, a concept can be described as \"a kind of' another concept or \"a part of' another concept. Some common categorizers include the specialization (AKO) relation, the decomposition (PARTOF) relation, and the equivalence (EQV) relation. All the concepts related by a categorizer are said to be in a categorization; some categorizations have hierar chical interpretations, while others are more naturally seen as networks. By knowing the position of a par ticular concept with respect to another concept in a categorization, the description of the former can be inferred from the latter. This descriptive inference in a categorization is called inheritance.\nFor instance, the specialization relation can be defined as follows:\nRepresentation Requirements for S\\lpporting Decision Model Furmulation 217\nDefinition .1 (Specialization) Let C be the set of all concepts. Let 0 be the set of categorizers. Let Ow \ufffd C be the set of concepts in a categorization related by categorizer w E 0. For all a, bE C, and for AKO E 0 where AKO <; C x C:\n1. AKO d\ufffd {(a, b)la C b, i.e., Vo:, a: E a => a: E b}.\n2. Let ako: C--+ Z: be a function defined on AKO: ako(a) = {bl(a, b) E AKO}.\nTwo major properties are observed for the AKO cate gorizer:\n1. a E 0AKO <==> 3b,(a,b) E AKO or (b, a) E AKO.\n2. The AKO relation is irreflexive, 88ymmetric, and transitive.\n3. The properties and interactions of the concepts are downward inheritable in the specialization hi erarchy.\n5.3 Context-Dependent Representation\nThe categorizers establish some general perspec tives for describing a concept. For example, a pulmonary-embolism is a kind of embolism in general. The description of a concept in these general perspec tives is further constrained by a set of contexts.\nA context ( CXT) relation can be thought of 88 a \"meta-categorizer;\" it is a binary relation that spec ifies the properties and the interactions of, and hence also the categorizers on a concept in ac cordance with those of another concept. For example, treatment-of-cardiomyopathy is speci fied 88 a kind of treatment-of-disease because treatment-of-cardiomyopathy is defined in the con text of cardiomyopathy, and cardiomyopathy is a kind of disease. All concepts are described in some contexts; the descriptions that are valid in general are in the universal context. Therefore, the ( CXT) relation facilitates representation of context-sensitive informa tion, 88 mentioned earlier, by allowing chaining of derived-concepts and constraining their descriptions. The partial-ordering imposed by this relation forms a context-hierarchy of all the concepts in the knowledge b88e.\n6 Supporting General Inferences\nB88ed on the above representation framework, we shall now discuss how the knowledge base of the proposed KBDS would provide answers for the inferences Ql Q4. In the following discussions:\n1. Let C be the set of all concepts.\n2. Let 0 = {AKO, ... }=the set of all categorizers. 3. Let :Fo = {fw lfw is a function defined on w, Vw E\n0} = { ako, ... } 88 defined in Section 5.2. 4. Let I = {association,\nprecedence, positive-influence, negative-influence, cause, inhibitor }=the set of all interaction types.\n5. Vi E I, let :Fz = {/;If; is a function defined on i} 6. Vf; E Fz, i E I,a,b E C, f;(a) = {bl(a,b)V(b, a) E\ni}.\n\u2022 Ql: Does concept A relate to concept B by < categorizer>?\nTo find out if two concepts A and B are related in an categorization, let Wo E 0 be the categorizer in ques tion.\nA { yes if (A, B) E w0 nswerql = no otherwise.\nAn example of the Ql query is: Does cardiomyopathy related to disease by specialization? The answer is: yes.\n\u2022 Q2: What are the concepts related to concept A by <categorizer>?\nTo find out the concepts related to a concept A in an categorization, again let Wo E 0 be the categorizer in question.\nAnswerq2 = fw.(A).\nAn example of the Ql query is: What are the con cepts that are related to embolism by specializa tion? The answers are: pumonary-embolism and systemic-embolism.\n\u2022 Q3: What are the concepts that relate to concept A by <interaction>?\nTo find out the concepts that directly interact with a concept A in an interaction, let i0 E I be the interac tion in question.\nAnswerqa = /;0(A).\nAn example of the Q3 query is: What are the concepts that relate to complication-of-anticoagulanttherapy by positive-influence? The answer is: presence-of -old -age.\n\u2022 Q4: Does concept A relate to concept B by <interaction>?\nTo find out whether two concepts A and tt B are in volved in an interaction, again let io E I be the inter action in question.\n218 Leong\n{ yes if (A, B) E io Answerq4 = no otherwise. An example Q4 query is: Does cardioJDyopathy relate to fainting by cause? (Read: Does cardioJDyopathy cause fainting?) The answer is: yes. For simplicity, all the answers to the above inferences assume a closed world assumption, i.e., a negative answer will be returned if a relation is not explic itly derivable from the knowledge base. The context sensitivity of the answers, though not very obvious, is actually inherent from the underlying representation.\n7 Related Work\nThe major shortcomings of the static decision modeling approach, i.e., treating pre-enumerated de cision models or templates as knowledge bases, result from the rigidity of the knowledge bases. Constrained by the structure of the decision models, e.g., nodes and links of a decision tree, such knowledge bases do not reflect the nature of the domain knowledge.\nThe different representations used in existing KBDS with the dynamic decision-modeling approach are not very satisfactory, either. The first order logic-like representations, such as those employed by Breese [1987, 1989], and Goldman and Charniak [1990], have no explicit hierarchical dimensions. In these frame works, multi-level decision models are created by ac tivation of a set of rules; limited contextual informa tion is captured as conditional probabilities matrices in these rules.\nIn Wellman's [1990a] SUDO-PLANNER system, do main descriptions can be expressed in multiple levels of precision in this framework, thus facilitating decision modeling in multiple levels of abstraction. The ter minological component of this framework, however, is subjected to the limited expressiveness of most term subsumption languages. Moreover, the purely proba bilistic nature of the effects or influences does not re flect the varying degrees of significance among the con cepts with respect to the problem at hand. Although some contextual effects on the influences can be ex pressed in the qualitative synergies defined in QPN, there is no general mechanism for capturing contex tual information in the whole framework.\nOther relevant representation formalisms include those that incorporate an uncertainty model to a hierarchical representation framework. Most hierarchical represen tations are designed to support derivation of absolute or categorical answers. To support approximate rea soning, i.e., finding out facts that are not absolutely true or false, but believed to a certain degree, some efforts attempt to accommodate an uncertainty model by re-interpreting the semantics of a categorical repre sentation, while others try to couple the two to form\na coherent framework.\nFor instance, in the network representation developed by Lin and Goebel [1990], both subsumption and causal relationships are expressible. Probabilistic in terpretations are given to parts of the causal network, called the scenarios. These scenarios can be consid ered as contexts with different probability distribu tions. Although the scenarios are not hierarchically arranged, their probabilistic rankings are preserved across the subsumption relationships. Nevertheless, this network formalism does not allow the properties, and hence the nature of each node or concept to be explicitly represented.\nYen and Bonissone's [1990] work attempts to general ize the semantics of term subsumption languages with an approximate reasoning model, such as fuzzy logic or possibility theory, to support plausible inferences. Non-definitional relations among the concepts, how ever, are not expressible in these frameworks. There is also no general notion of context-dependent defini tions.\nSaffiotti's [1990] hybrid framework, on the other hand, integrates a component that deals with absolute or cat egorical knowledge and another with the uncertainty of this knowledge. Any formal representation formalism and uncertainty model may constitute the two com ponents in the framework, e.g., first-order logic with Dempster-Shafer theory, term subsumption language with probability theory, etc. We believe this work is an important step toward the theoretical foundations of integrating categorical and uncertain know ledge. The expressiveness and hence the usefulness of the frame work, however, depend solely on the component for malisms.\n8 Discussion and Conclusion\nTo support dynamic decision-modeling, the structure of the knowledge base must reflect the nature of both the decision problem and the domain knowledge. In particular, the underlying representation must neither be restricted by the structural components of the de cision models, e.g., nodes and links of an influence di agram, nor their evaluation mechanisms, e.g., folding back of a decision tree. By focusing on the ontology of a decision problem, we have identified a set of infer ence patterns and knowledge types for supporting au tomated construction of decision models in medicine.\nThe brief survey on existing representations has shed some light on a design approach for integrating cate gorical and uncertain knowledge in a context-sensitive manner. We believe such an integration calls for a framework with a terminological component, an asser tional component, and a network interpretation. By capturing the context notion via partitioning the net work, this framework would allow us to establish tax-\nRepresentation Requirements for Supporting Decision Model furmulation 219\nonomies of structured concepts, state the facts, i.e., the interactions among the concepts, and answer questions about these relations.\nWe have sketched a design outline of such a repre sentation in this paper; a more detailed exposition is described elsewhere [Leong, 1991]. Many important issues, however, are yet to be explored. In partic ular, the notion of \"context\" needs to be more for mally defined, many interesting problems arise in the context-sensitive inheritance patterns of the categor ical relations, and the context-sensitive probabilistic semantics of the interactions needs to be generalized. Careful examination of these issues, we believe, will lead to the formalization of both the automated de cision model formulation process and the domain and decision-analytic knowledge involved.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author would like to thank Peter Szolovits for ad vice on the project, Mike Wellman for many helpful discussions, Jon Doyle for comments on the mathemat ical definitions and U.TE]Xformatting, and the anony mous referees for suggestions on the presentation of this paper.\nThis research was supported by the National Institutes of Health grant no. 5 R01 LM04493 from the National Library of Medicine.\nReferences\n[Beck and Pauker, 1981] J.
