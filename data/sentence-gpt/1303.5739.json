Diagnostic reasoning is formulated as a sequential stochastic process, and is modeled using influence diagrams. Given a set O of observations, DYNASTY creates an influence diagram in order to devise the best action given O. The system is based on the model that predicts what is likely to happen, and it allows a prediction algorithm to interpret data from the O\u202c.\n\n\nThe idea behind DYNASTY is to build an O model on the underlying information. This way the model can perform a range of task-specific tasks.\nWhen you are creating a probabilistic system, the system is modeled from one data point to the next. This means that the system may perform a range of tasks to evaluate the probability of a given prediction.\nThe Probabilistic Network Model is a new type of probabilistic network construction system. In general, it was developed in collaboration with the TRS Research Institute, a research and development group of researchers.\nThe Probabilistic Network Model (PBMC) was formed to represent one of the main components of the system. The idea is that an individual who will be able to predict an appropriate task can predict the behavior of a given task. The PNPMC is a network that generates predictions that are based on three types of observations:\nThe PNPMC consists of two categories of information: 1) the occurrence of an expected occurrence of a given probability of a given occurrence of an expected occurrence of a given occurrence of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given probability of a given", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:32:27 GMT  (345kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5739v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["gregory m provan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5739"}, "pdf": {"name": "1303.5739.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "DYNAMIC NETWORK UPDATING TECHNIQUES FOR DIAGNOSTIC REASONING", "authors": [], "emails": ["provan@cis.upenn.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "1 INTRODUCTION\nThe development of graphical representations for prob abilistic models (e.g. belief networks [Pearl, 1988], influence diagrams (Howard and Matheson, 1981; Shachter, 1986; Shachter, 1988)) has enabled effi cient probabilistic models to be developed for many tasks, such as diagnostic reasoning (Pearl, 1988; Heck erman and Horvitz, 1990], natural language analy sis(Goldman and Charniak, 1990], etc. These represen tations, by specifying the causal relationships among variables in a causal graph (and not all possible rela tionships), facilitate efficient inference. A great deal of the recent research in automated probabilistic reason ing has focused on developing more efficient and more general algorithms for causal probabilistic models, and on methods for incrementally constructing belief net works.\nHowever, the application of these techniques and rep-\nresentations to complex diagnostic tasks, such as med ical diagnosis, have oversimplified such tasks. A com mon simplification made in many current approaches is modeling the diagnostic process as a single-stage, static process. This is inadequate, as diagnostic rea soning is a sequential, dynamic process in which feed back is important. Provan and Poole (1991] point out the necessity of considering this complete process, and in particular, the effects of feedback.\nThis paper exteJ;Jds existing diagnostic models to incor porate the dynamic and sequential nature of diagnos tic reasoning. It proposes techniques for constructing sequential belief networks, and of dynamically updat ing such networks. Many existing techniques for con structing belief networks (e.g. (Goldman and Char niak, 1990; Heckerman and Horvitz, 1990]) model the process for one instant of time.1 For certain tasks this is adequate, but for tasks in which the probabilistic re lationships among variables changes over time, it can be difficult to know when the best model has been con structed. This sometimes produces incorrect answers due to the selection of incorrect probabilities and/or causal relationships. Hence, both the diagnosis and the decision taken given this diagnosis may hinge on whether the best model has been constructed, given the data at a particular time t. Sensitivity analyses may be used to test how the data at different times af fects the best decision. If the sensitivity analyses show that a better decision would be made under an alter native model, then the model needs to be updated. It is these sensitivity analyses and model updating tech niques that are of interest here. Criteria are proposed to determine when network topology revisions are nec essary given time-varying probabilistic and causal re lationships. These criteria are based on examining the equivalence of outcomes (e.g. treatments for dis eases). Algorithms for conducting the necessary revi sions are outlined, including refinement and coarsening techniques (Chang and Fung, 1990], and other network\n1This is true even for systems in which the mode], can be constructed incrementally, e.g. [Goldman and Char niak, 1990).\n280 Provan\nrevision algorithms [Pearl, 1988; Srinivas and Breese, 1990]..\nThis approach makes dynamic network updating pos sible, and formalizes the sequential nature of diagnos tic reasoning (e.g. to allow feedback into the network). The explicit introduction of utilities into diagnostic models2 allows a more realistic formalization of the diagnostic process. In addition, it is expected that the techniques developed for diagnostic reasoning m<ty be applied to other domains, where appropriate.\n2 DYNAMICS OF DIAGNOSTIC\nREASONING UNDER\nUNCERTAINTY\nTreating a diagnostic task as being time-independent can lead to incorrect results in certain domains. Con sider medical diagnosis, and in particular the diagnosis of abdominal pain. Constructing a model for the ob servation of abdominal pain should not be done for a single time interval, since, as noted in [Schwartz et a/., 1986], many symptoms take on different meanings as diseases evolve over time, both in terms of their inter-relationships and the diseases indicated by the particular symptoms. In a possible case of appendici tis, the initial symptoms include non-specific abdom inal pain (which could be confused with many other ailments), and are often accompanied soon thereafter by gastrointestinal distress and possibly by anorexia and fever. This pain subsequently becomes localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) of the abdomen (which then provides a strong indication of appendici tis, along with a high white blood count). If the ap pendix ruptures, then there are several more symp toms; however, a perforated appendix leads to serious internal complications.3 Given the evolution of a dis ease such as appendicitis, the probabilities assigned to network nodes, and even the topology of the network itself, must change over time. For example, Figure 1 shows how the likelihood ratio for the diagnosis of appendicitis might change over time. Clearly, in the initial stages of appendicitis, many other diagnoses are equally likely given the symptoms.\nA second aspect of this dynamic nature of (diagnostic) reasoning is the need for modeling the temporal order of observations. In some cases the temporal sequence of observations (as opposed to just an unordered list of the set of observations) can provide strong cues for a diagnosis. For example, if a woman has abdominal pain, noting whether this pain is immediately followed by gastrointestinal distress could help identify a pos-\n2Utility considerations have been ignored in most formal models of diagnostic reasoning, except for approaches such as [Heckerman and Horvitz, 1990].\n3Most diagnostic procedures attempt to avoid perfora tion and its resulting complications.\nsible case of appendicitis, whereas the absence of such immediate distress would make the presence of a gono horreal cyst in the right fallopian tub<' more likely. A second example is the diagnosis of a car which has trouble starting. The sequence of events leading to the inability to start can help identify the problem. Thus, the inability to start only on mornings after it has rained may indicate that moisture is getting under the distributor cap.\nA third aspect is the ability to incorporate the effects of feedback. Feedback can alter not only the proba bility assignments to a network, but also the topol ogy of the network. For example, consider a network constructed for a case of RLQ abdominal distress. If simple stomach upset is diagnosed, and a treatment of Diovol is administered, the persistence of RLQ ab dominal distress will provide feedback to the system that the diagnosis may be incorrect, and the network topology and/or probabilities may need to be updated.\nThis paper proposes extensions to existing network construction techniques to model diagnostic reasoning as a sequential, dynamic process using the formalism of influence diagrams. This proposal is not intended to be a full temporal calculus based on Bayesian networks, as discussed in [Kanazawa, 1991], for example. Instead, it attempts to build simple networks which will real istically model the dynamics of diagnostic reasoning without necessitating the complicated (and computa tionally costly) construction and solution of temporal Bayesian networks.\n3 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE\nThere are many existing systems and theories for model construction. Examples of such n<>twork con struction frameworks include the proposal of Lf'hmann [1990], and examples of such systems include Q.\\!R DT [Shwe and Cooper, 1990] and FRAIL3 [Goldman and Charniak, 1990]. In each of these proposals, the\nDynamic Network Updating Techniques for Diagnostic Reasoning 281\ngoal is to construct a model which completely charac terizes the data. However, this goal conflicts with the need for efficient performance of implemented systems. Solving Bayesian network models is NP-hard [Cooper, 1990], so the networks constructed must be as small as possible to ensure efficiency. The proposal presented in this paper trades off (to some extent) completeness and accuracy for efficiency, as is done in many other systems, such as [Heckerman and Horvitz, 1990).4\nA new system architecture proposed to model dynamic reasoning tasks is depicted in Figure 2. This system is called DYNASTY, for DYnamic Network Analysis of System TopologY.\nLike several existing network construction methods (e.g. QMR-DT, FRAIL3), we start with a Knowl edge Base (KB) containing (1) causal rules, and (2) a set of conditional probability tables. From this KB a network is constructed to solve a given task.\nThe KB for DYNASTY consists of a network of nodes and arcs. Nodes represent state variables, and arcs exist between pairs of nodes related causally and/or temporally.\nAssociated with the network are probability tables for the conditional probabilities for the network, such as those required for the construction of a Bayesian net work. In addition, utility values are stored for decision making.\nTypically, the complete KB for a given domain is quite large,5 and given a set 0 of observations, it is necessary to construct a network containing only the data related to 0 (and not the entire KB).\nWithin the general model-construction framework (such as that described in Lehmann ( 1990)), there is al ways uncertainty in choosing the correct model. That uncertainty may be due to uncertainty in the instru ments used to record data, to noise, or to the rela tionship between data from observations and causes for the observations (e.g. the diseases causing the ob served symptoms). This paper examines the uncer tainty arising from relating observations and causes, and in particular the temporal uncertainty of this re lationship.\nThe remainder of the paper discusses the algorithms used to create an influence diagram from the KB, and for dynamically altering this influence diagram.\n4The appropriate balance of resources between meta analysis of model construction and model solution has been studied by [Horvitz et al., 1989; Breese and Horvitz, 1990].\n5 As an example, the QMR-DT network represents 534 diseases, 4040 manifestations and 40,740 disease manifestation arcs [Heckerman and Horvitz, 1990].\nAs noted earlier, diagnostic tasks whose characteristics change over time have not been modeled in earlier ap proaches. The approach taken in DYNASTY is to dis cretize the possible times from which the observations could have occurred. Call 'D,, the network (consisting of causes and intermediate causes/observations) which would need to be constructed at time t;. In full gener ality, the networks at different times are different, and they can each be quite large for complicated tasks. To fully model a diagnostic task, an influence diagram (ID) containing sub-networks for each time I; would need to be constructed, given a set 0 of observations. This is shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3: Most general influence diagram for solving a stochastic diagnostic task\n282 Provan\nDYNASTY attempts to solve a simplified task: it cre ates a network for particular time t j , and then con ducts a sensitivity analysis to determine if the action taken is affected by the choice of time tj. The ID which would be constructed is shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 4: Simplified influence diagram for solving a stochastic diagnostic task\nExample 1 Consider the time course of a possible case of appendicitis. Early in the course of appen dicitis, the symptoms could appear to be a simple up set stomach. Figure 5 shows the notation necessary\nto construct IDs for this task. If the observations are nausea and general abdominal pain, then the simple ID shown in Figure 6 may be constructed. This is an easy influence diagram to construct and solve. Given an ID\nFigure 6: Simple influence diagram for abdominal pain example\nsuch as this, the possible treatments are the adminis tration of an emetic (for food poisoning) or Diovol (for simple upset stomach).\nHowever, these observations may actually be indica tive of the early stages of appendicitis. To make sure that a possible case of appendicitis might be diag nosed, the ID shown in Figure 7 must be constructed. This ID bears little relation to the ID shown in Fig ure 6. The possible treatments include: (1) emetic (for\nFigure 7: More complex influence diagram for abdom inal pain example\nfood poisoning), (2) Diovol (for simple upset stomach), (3) removal of appendix (for appendicitis), or ( 4) treat ment or removal of gonohorreal cyst.\nThis example shows how, given a set of observations, uncertainty in the time course of possible diseases may require entirely different IDs. \"'\nThere are a number of heuristics used in DYNASTY for network construction. One heuristic is the use of temporal orderings for probability assignments. This heuristic is best demonstrated by an example. Con sider the diagnosis of a car which infrequently has problems starting. The two diagnoses under consid eration are a distributor cap problem (DC) or an al ternator problem (ALT). The weather (Vi') may affect the diagnosis, as wet conditions can cause condensa tion under a distributor....\u00a3!!:J>, thereby causing the fail ure of the car to start (ST). Other possible causes of the problems in starting, e.g. the alternator may be faulty and not recharging the battery, are not affected by weather conditions. A simple Bayes network for this problem is shown in Figure 8. Knowledge of the\nFigure 8: Bayesian network model for determining the cause of the failure of a car to start\nhistory of the correlation between weather conditions\nDynamic Network Updating Techniques for Diagnostic Reasoning 283\nand success in starting the car can significantly affect the probabilities assigned to the network. For exam ple, if the car only gives trouble starting in wet con ditions, then the problem is most likely DC; if the car gives trouble with equal probability in both wet and dry conditions, then the problem is most likely ALT. In fact, trouble in a single instance when the weather is dry will lead to the assignment of a low probabil ity to P(DCIST, W). In this case, the history of the problem is crucial to the probability assignment.\nHence, the history heuristic is the use of temporal his tory, whenever possible, in selecting the probabilities (from the probability tables) to be assigned to the net work in consideration. The temporal history is com puted simply by tracing the history for a node in the KB, using revised Truth Maintenance algorithms for computing the justifications for a node in a depen dency network [McAllester, 1990]. The history heuris tic also uses triggers to guide probability assignments. For example, finding a single instance when the car won't start in dry conditions is a tri\ufffd to the assign ment of a low probability to P(DCIST, W).\n4.2 Sequential Diagnostic Process\nThe ID framework also allows diagnostic reasoning to be formulated as a sequential diagnostic process. Us ing a result of Tatman and Shachter [ 1990], an ID can model a sequential process using dynamic program ming, provided that the value function Vis separable. In terms of IDs, a value node is separable if it can be represented as the sum or product of multiple sub value nodes.\nValue node separability has been exploited in the de sign of a sequential process for image understanding [Levitt et al., 1990]. In a similar manner, value node separability is used to model the sequential nature of diagnostic reasoning. In brief, the decision nodes in a DYNASTY ID are called treatments, which may be tests to determine more observations, or actual treat ments for hypothesized diseases. In the former case, given an ID shown in Figure 6, the test T can deter mine a new observation 0', creating a new ID with another decisit>t. node T' (e.g. another test or a treat ment) and another value node V'. In this manner, the sequential nature of tests (or treatments) providing feedback to the diagnostic process can be modeled. 6\n5 MODEL UPDATING\n5.1 Overview\nIn a problem for which probabilities are temporally dependent, the sensitivity of the computed decisions\n6Please refer to [Provan, 1991 (forthcoming)] for more details. The presentation here is brief due to space limitations.\nto the temporally-dependent probabilities must be tested. This provides a threshold for determining when a better model is warranted. This may require new probability values (corresponding to a new time t'), or a new network topology corresponding to time t'.\nThis sensitivity analysis/model updating in DY NASTY occurs in two stages:\nSensitivity Analysis F irst, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine if data from time t' pro vides a better model than the data from time t.\nModel Updating If the network model needs to be updated, then some of the following processes may need to be invoked:\nI. New probability values are assigned and propagated to compute a new network equi librium state.\n2. Network topology is altered. 3. A new model is built for a different time t'.\nThese processes are now discussed in greater detail.\n5.2 Equivalence Class Sensitivity Analysis\nGiven the construction of an ID model at time t, a deci sion (with accompanying diagnosis) of maximal utility is computed. For example, in the car diagnosis ex ample, the diagnosis might be DC, and the decision REPLACE-DC. This decision would maximise the re quirement of ensuring that the car no longer has trou ble starting.\nIn the process of computing this best decision, the next-best decision for a different equivalence class is also recorded. In the car example, this is REPLACE ALT. If there is uncertainty concerning which proba bilities are correct, then the sensitivity of the decision to this uncertainty must be determined. This is for malised in terms of equivalence classes of decisions as follows.\n5.2.1 Analysis of Equivalence Class es\nThe equivalence class approach to diagnosis, as origi nally formulated in [Provan and Poole, 1991], is sum marised here. The rationale is that there is no point in distinguishing between decision-equivalent diagnoses, i.e. diagnoses for which the decision taken (e.g. ad ministration of drugs to a patient) are the same; as far as the decision-maker is concerned decision-equivalent diagnoses should be considered as the same diagnosis.\nThe aim of diagnostic reasoning is to provide a treat ment for a set of observations. From an equivalence class point of view, this reduces to refining the set of use-equivalent possibilities; i.e. one does not care about distinct diagnoses, but distinct treatments (and their associated distinct equivalence classes). Thus,\n284 Provan\nuse-equivalence induces a partition on the set of diag noses, where each partition corresponds to a possible distinct decision.\nLet T be the set of all treatments (or decisions). 7 Let V be the set of all possible diagnoses.\nDefinition 5.1 The possible treatment space P is a subset of V x T. (D, T) E P means that T is a possible treatment given that the diagnosis is D E V.\nP induces an equivalence relation on the set of diag noses. This will be called strong equivalence with re spect to P. The idea is that equivalent diagnoses have the same set of possible treatments.8\nDefinition 5.2 Two diagnoses D1 and D2 are strongly equivalent with respect to P, written D1 \"\"P Dz if V T E T, (D1, T) E P if and only if (D2, T) E P.\n5.2.2 Equivalence Class Decision-making\nWe assume we have a measure p( D, T) of the utility of treatment T given diagnosis D. We can define the pos sible treatment space as the set of diagnoses with the same utility.9 In this case, \"strong use-equivalence\" means having the same utility for each treatment.\nLet V be the set of use-diagnoses. For D E V, every logical model of D has the same utility measure. The following proposition about the expected value, \u00a3(T), of treatment T was proven in (Pro van and Poole, 1991]:\n\u00a3(T) = L p(D, T) X p(D). (1) DEV\nUnder this approach to diagnostic reasoning, diagnoses are selected such that the expected utility of the treat ment is maximised. That is, the goal is to compute 'Yi such that the expected value of the treatment given by equation 1 is maximised.\nConsider an ID in which the variables are denoted by X= {x1, .... ,xn}, such that any diagnosis D consists of a subset of variables X' C X which are not func tioning normally (cf. (de J(leer et a/., 1990; Pearl, 1988; Provan and Poole, 1991] for a further descrip tion of such diagnostic models). Then equation 1 can\n7By a treatment we mean a total prescription of what to do (i.e., we do not conjoin different treatments - the conjunction would be one treatment). A treatment may be a test to distinguish abnormalities, the administration of drugs, replacement of circuit components, etc.\n80ther types of equivalences, e.g. weak equivalence, are also distinguished in [Provan and Poole, 1991]; such cases are not discussed here due to space limitations.\n9Formally, the treatment in the possible treatment space would be a pair (T, v) where (D, (T, v)) E P if I'(D, T) = v.\nbe rewritten in terms of these variables as\nf[TJ= L LJI.(x,T)xp(x), (2) DEV Dl=x\nwhere JI.( x, T) is the value of p( D, T) such that x is true in D. The notion behind the sensitivity analysis is as fol lows: consider a model constructed at time t, such that decision T; is the optimal treatment. Call f3 the expected utility for decision T;. If the probabilities of certain variables are time-dependent, then these new probabilities need to be substituted into the model to check if the decision would change. Note that differ ent diagnoses may be computed, but if the decision is unchanged, then, under this use-equivalent approach, no network updating is necessary. For network updat ing to be necessary, the threshold f3 must be exceeded by the expected utility of another treatment Tj given probabilities for timet', i.e.\n[f(Tj ] = L L p(x, T) x p(x)] > f]. DEV DFX\nThis provides a precise bound on when the treatment changes. When the threshold is exceeded, then net work alterations may be necessary. These updating methods are now summarised.\n5.3 Model Updating Techniques\nThere are several types of model updating operations, of which two of the most important are: (1) probability value updating, and (2) network topology updating. These are discussed in turn.\n5.3.1 Probability Value Updating\nThis is the simple case of network updating. If no changes to the network topology are required when the model is updated from time t to t', then the re quired alterations to the probability values are made, and these values are propagated to obtain a new net work equilibrium state.\nFor example, during the early stages of appendicitis diagnosis, probability values may need to be updated given changes in location of abdominal pain. Possible changes in probability assignments are shown in Figure 9(b),(c).\n5.3.2 Network Topology Updating\nConsider the onset of an entirely new set of symptoms in the observation of a patient with a possible case of the later stages of appendicitis. These are shown in F igure 7. If we started with the model in Figure 6, we see that the topology of the network needs to be altered.\nDynamic Network Updating Techniques for Diagnostic Reasoning 285\nFigure 9: Early stages of the diagnosis of appendicitis\n(a) (b) (c)\nIf changes to the network topology are required when the model is updated from time t to t', then one of several algorithms may be used. These algorithms in clude:\nRefinement/ coarsening Refinement/ coarsening operations [Chang and Fung, 1990] are used to split/merge network nodes respectively. Consider a network refinement necessary to include new al ternatives. For example, in abdominal diagnosis, the construction of a network which models only lower abdominal pain may need to be refined to differentiate right-lower quadrant (RLQ) and left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain. Hence, a node mod eling lower abdominal pain needs to be split into nodes for RLQ and LLQ (cf. Figures 9(a),(b)). Or in the car diagnosis example, the single node for weather may need to be split into nodes for wet weather and mixed (wet and dry) weather. The network changes made for the refine ment/coarsening operations are local, and do not involve all nodes in the network. This is for malised as follows. If x is a state node, then we call lix the predecessors of x in the network, and I:x the successors of x in the network. The Markov boundary of x is the minimal set of nodes which \"shield\" x from the rest of the network. The Markov boundary M(x) of node x consists of lix U I:x U liE,. Hence, ensuring the joint prob ability distribution of M(x) is unaffected by the refinement/coarsening or x ensures that the rest of the network will be unaffected as well. For example, it is shown in [Chang and Fung, 1990] that in a refinement of the values of the state space of variable x, flx, each value Wx E rlx is refined into multiple values w\ufffd E R(wx)\u00b7 For each value Wx E rlx which is refined into a value w\ufffd E R(wx),\np(I:x lwx, liE, )p( Wx, lix)\n2:::: p(I:xlw\ufffd, liE.)p(w\ufffd, lix) (3) w\ufffdER(wx)\nmust be satisfied for all values of lix. This pro-\nvides a set of constraints on how M(x) must be altered. In an analogous manner, constraints can be defined for the coarsening of the values of the state space of variable x, flx, where multiple val ues of Wx E rlx are combined into a single value w\ufffd E C(wx)\u00b7 The coarsening operation is defined similarly [Chang and Fung, 1990]. The coarsening oper ation may lose information during the process of node aggregation (i.e. the network proba bility assignments may be altered). Using the equivalence-class approach, such information loss is acceptable if the equivalence class does not change. Otherwise, approximations may need to be used [Chang and Fung, 1990].\nNetwork additions Instead of splitting and/or merging existing nodes, completely new nodes may need to be added to, or particular nodes deleted from, the network. In such cases a va riety of other algorithms are invoked, such as the reduction and clustering algorithms present in the IDEAL system algorithm library [Srinivas and Breese, 1990]. In network addition, the KB is consulted to determine which nodes must be added based on causal relationships.\nNetwork Re-instantiation It may turn out that the network created is inappropriate for the diag nostic task. For example, a simple network may be created which cannot be appropriately aug mented to model a more complicated case10 In such a situation, a completely new network is con structed from the KB.\n5.4 Implementation\nThe KB is implemented in Common Lisp. Extended Justification-based TMS (e.g. [McAllester, 1990]) data structures and algorithms are used for determining relevant nodes to instantiate given a set of observa tions. The inti uence diagrams are implemented using the IDEAL system [Srinivas and Breese, 1990].\nIt is hoped that the TraumAID system [\\Yeb her et a/., 1990] will be used as a test-bed for this system. TraumAID is a decision support tool for the manage ment of multiple trauma. Trauma management in cludes both diagnosis and treatment, and this diagnos tic tool achieves these features using two modules: (1) a rule-based reasoner which models the relationships between clinical evidence and diagnostic/therapeutic goals, and (2) a planner which manages the achieve ment of multiple goals. TraumAID is an excellent sys tem on which to test the theoretical results because, unlike most similar systems, it already contains a no-\n101f radical changes must be made to an initial network, it can be computationally cheaper to create a new net work from scratch than to alter the original network using coarsening/refinement operations.\n286 Provan\ntion of sequential action and change, key elements of the proposed theory of diagnostic reasoning. Further, efficient incremental management of action and change is necessary for trauma management.\n6 CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper has described a proposed dynamic network construction system which can build models for prob lems with temporally-dependent probabilities. Heuris tics are used to identify the best possible model, and to test the sensitivity of this model to probability val ues over time. Given the network updating capabil ities of DYNASTY, the full diagnostic cycle, which includes feedback from the decisions made, can be in corporated into the network. In addition, the ability to refine/coarsen the network enables different levels of granularity (i.e. the coarseness of the description of the system being modeled) to be examined during the diagnostic process. Most other approaches to diagnos tic reasoning (e.g. [de Kleer et a/., 1990]) have no way of dynamically altering the granularity of the system description.\nFuture work includes testing the feasibility of the al gorithms in DYNASTY on real-world problems, and extending and optimising these algorithms. The KB for the TraumAID system is the first set of real data for which such tests are proposed.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: The comments of the anonymous reviewers have led to improvements in the paper.\nReferences\n[Breese and Horvitz, 1990] J.
