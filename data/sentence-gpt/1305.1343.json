We hypothesise that term frequencies may yield useful information for scientometric analysis. In our work we ask if word features in combination with Bayesian analysis allow well-founded science mapping studies to be used in order to study the relevance of the term structure, such as the frequency and distribution of the first words in the English language (Bagley, A.J., 2011; Rodd et al., 2010). The number of words in the English language is more than twice the number in the British, but it is often estimated at an increased percentage than in the American, so a significant number of words may be of interest. However, our finding is consistent with other meta-analyses that are using word structures in combination with Bayesian analysis. Our findings show that when we use the term structure for words in combination with Bayesian analysis we also observe a correlation between the frequency of words in combination with Bayesian analysis and the frequency of words in combination with Bayesian analysis. The authors report that the frequency of words in combination with Bayesian analysis is slightly greater than that of Bayesian analysis. Using Bayesian analysis, we have a significant effect on the number of words in combination with Bayesian analysis, which has a greater effect on the frequency of words in combination with Bayesian analysis than is found in other studies.\n\n\n\n\nWe believe that our findings demonstrate a causal relationship between the frequency of words in combination with Bayesian analysis and the frequency of words in combination with Bayesian analysis. Our results suggest that when they are applied to words in combination with Bayesian analysis the frequency of words in combination with Bayesian analysis is the same as in any other literature. As well as showing evidence that words in combination with Bayesian analysis are similar to words in combination with Bayesian analysis, we also show that if word structure is used in combination with Bayesian analysis we also observe a correlation between the frequency of words in combination with Bayesian analysis and the frequency of words in combination with Bayesian analysis. Furthermore, this is consistent with the relationship between the frequency of words in combination with Bayesian analysis and the frequency of words in combination with Bayesian analysis. We propose that when we use the term structure for words in combination with Bayesian analysis, the frequency of words in combination with Bayesian analysis is the same as in", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 May 2013 22:24:20 GMT  (810kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1343v1", "Accepted: 14th International Society of Scientometrics and Informetrics Conference, Vienna Austria 15-19th July 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted: 14th International Society of Scientometrics and Informetrics Conference, Vienna Austria 15-19th July 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DL cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["arnim bleier", "andreas strotmann"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.1343"}, "pdf": {"name": "1305.1343.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Towards an Author-Topic-Term-Model Visualization of 100 Years of German Sociological Society Proceedings", "authors": ["Arnim Bleier", "Andreas Strotmann"], "emails": ["andreas.strotmann}@gesis.org"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Towards an Author-Topic-Term-Model Visualization of 100 Years of German Sociological Society Proceedings\nArnim Bleier and Andreas Strotmann\n{arnim.bleier, andreas.strotmann}@gesis.org GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Unter Sachsenhausen 6-8,\nCologne (Germany)"}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Author co-citation studies (Zhao & Strotmann, 2008) employ factor analysis to reduce highdimensional co-citation matrices to low dimensional and possibly interpretable factors, but these studies do not use any information from the text bodies of publications.

Each document d is associated with a set of authors \ud835\udc8b! from the set of all authors, J. Our model assumes that documents are generated in the following steps:\n1.

The statistical model takes into account that documents are written by multiple authors, that authors write on different topics to different degrees, and that words pertain to different topics to varying degrees. Figure 1 shows a small fragment of a map of German sociological science based on ~100 years of DGS proceedings, inspired by the visualization of results of co-citation-based factor analysis in Zhao & Strotmann (2008), but generated fully automatically from the results of applying this statistical analysis technique to full texts. While a full evaluation remains to be done, these results show some promise for the application of these methods in scientometric studies."}], "references": [{"title": "A simple non-parametric Topic Mixture for Authors and Documents", "author": ["A.
