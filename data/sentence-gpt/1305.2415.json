A bandit algorithm B exploits its past experience to select actions that appear more frequently. Besides, these seemingly optimal actions may in fact be suboptimal, because of the imprecision in B\u2019s knowledge. In order to avoid this undesired case, B has to explore actions by choosing seemingly suboptimal actions so as to gather more information about them. Exploitation can decrease short-term user\u2019s satisfaction since some suboptimal actions may be chosen. However, obtaining information about the actions\u2019 average rewards (i.e., exploration) can refine B\u2019s estimate of the actions\u2019 rewards and in turn increases long-term user\u2019s satisfaction. Clearly, neither a purely exploring nor a purely exploiting algorithm works well, and a good tradeoff is needed. One interesting solution to the multi-armed bandit problem is the LINUCB strategy. This is an extension of the UCB algorithm to the parametric case [9]. It selects the document for which mean standard deviation is maximum. We propose to improve this approach by adding a random exploration \u03b5 , also the \u03b5 parameter controls essentially the exp/exr tradeoff between exploitation and exploration is computed using the exponentiated gradient .\nOne drawback of this algorithm is that it is difficult to decide in advance the optimal value. Instead, we introduce an algorithm named Gradien-LINUCB that achieves this goal by balancing adaptively the exp/exr tradeoff using gradient optimization. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the key notions used throughout this paper. Section 3 reviews some related works. Section 4 describes the algorithms involved in the proposed approach. The experimental evaluation is illustrated in Section 5. The last section concludes the paper and points out possible directions for future work."}, {"heading": "2 Key Notions", "text": "We formally define contextual bandit problems and bandit algorithms .\nDefinition (Contextual bandit problem) .\nIn a contextual bandits problem, there is a distribution P over (x, r1, ..., rk), where x is context, a \u2208 {1, . . . , k} is one of the k arms to be pulled, and ra \u2208 [0,1] is the reward for arm a. The problem is a repeated game: on each round, a sample (x, r1, ..., rk) is drawn from P, the context x is announced, and then for precisely one arm a chosen by the player, its reward ra is revealed.\nDefinition (Contextual bandit algorithm) .\nA contextual bandits algorithm B determines an arm a \u2208 {1, . . . , k} to pull at each time step t, based on the previous observation sequence (x1, a1, ra,1), . . . ,(xt\u22121, at\u22121, ra,t\u22121), and the current context xt.)."}, {"heading": "3 Related Work", "text": "Very frequently used in reinforcement learning to study the exr/exp tradeoff, the multi-armed bandit problem was originally described by Robbins [7]. Few research works are dedicated to study the contextual bandit problem on recommender systems, where they consider the user\u2019s behavior as the context of the bandit problem. In [6], the authors extend the \u03b5-greedy strategy by dynamically updating the \u03b5 exploration value. At each iteration, they run a sampling procedure to select a new \u03b5 from a finite set of candidates. The probabilities associated to the candidates are uniformly initialized and updated with the Exponentiated Gradient (EG) [5]. This updating rule increases the probability of a candidate \u03b5 if it leads to a user\u2019s click. In [9], authors model the recommendation as a contextual bandit problem. They propose an approach in which a learning algorithm sequentially selects documents to serve users based on their behavior. To maximize the total number of user\u2019s clicks, this work proposes LINUCB algorithm that is computationally efficient.\nAs shown above, both LINUCB and EG-greedy are interesting approach to solve the context bandit algorithm. Our intuition is that, combining these approaches lead to improve the result. This strategy uses the LINUCB and adds the EG for defining the optimal exploration (\u03b5)."}, {"heading": "3.1 The LINUCB algorithm", "text": "Assuming that the expected reward of a document is linear in its features, the authors propose an approach in which a learning algorithm selects sequentially documents to serve users based on contextual information about the users and the documents.\nAlgorithm 2 The LINUCB algorithm Input: \u03b1 \u2208 R+ for t=1 to T do Observe features of all documents a \u2208 At : xt;a \u2208 R d for all a \u2208 At do if a is new then Aa  Id(d-dimensional identity matrix) ba 0d*1 (d-dimensional zero vector) end if \u03b8aA 1 a * ba pt;a \u03b8a T xt;a + \u221a\u03b1 xt;a T A a -1 xt;a end for Choose document at = argmaxa\u2208At pt;a with ties broken arbitrarily, and observe a real-valued payoff rt Aat Aat + xt;at xt;at batbat + rtxt,at end for\nIn Alg. 1, At is the set of documents a at the iteration t, where xa,t is the feature vector of the a with d-dimension, \u03b8 is the unknown coefficient vector of the feature xa,t is a constant and Aa = Da T Da + Id.

Given a user visiting a publisher page, the problem is to select the best advertisement for that user. A key element in this matching problem is the click-trough rate (CTR) estimation: what is the probability that a given ad will be clicked given some context (user, page visited)? Indeed, in a cost-per-click (CPC) campaign, the advertiser only pays when his ad gets clicked. is the reason why it is important to select ads with high CTRs. There is of course a fundamental exploration / exploitation dilemma here: in order to learn the CTR of an ad, it needs to be displayed, leading to a potential loss of short-term revenue. More details on the data and on display advertising cab be found in (Agarwal et al., 2010). To test the proposed Gradien-LINUCB algorithm, The testing step consists of evaluating the algorithms for each testing iteration using the average CTR. The average CTR for a particular iteration is the ratio between the total number of clicks and the total number of displays. Then, we calculate the average CTR over every 1000 iterations. The number of documents (N) returned by the recommender system for each iteration is 10 and we have run the simulation until the number of iterations reaches 10000, which is the number of iterations where all algorithms have converged.\nIn the first experiment, in addition to a pure exploitation baseline, we have compared our algorithm to the algorithms described in the related work (Section 3): EGgreedy; LINUCB. In Fig. 2, the horizontal axis is the number of iterations and the vertical axis is the performance metric.\nWe have several observations regarding the different exr/exp algorithms. For the \u03b5decreasing algorithm, the converged average CTR increases as the \u03b5 decreases (exploitation augments).\nWhile the EG algorithm converges to a higher average CTR, its overall performance\nis not as good as LinUCB. Its average CTR is low at the early step because of more exploration, but does not converge faster. The Gradien-LINUCB algorithm effectively learns the optimal \u03b5; it has the best convergence rate, increases the average CTR by a factor of 1,5 over the baseline and outperforms all other exr/exp algorithms. The improvement comes from a dynamic tradeoff between exr/exp, controlled by the EG estimation."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have presented an Exponentiated Gradient LINUCB algorithm for contextual multi-armed bandits.
