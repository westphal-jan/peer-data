INTRODUCTION\nMining microarray gene expression data is an important research topic in bioinformatics with broad applications. Microarray technologies are powerful techniques for simultaneously monitoring the expression of thousands of genes under different sets of conditions. Gene expression data can be analyzed in two ways: unsupervised and supervised analysis. In supervised analysis, information about the structure/groupings of the object is assumed known or at least partially known. This prior knowledge is used in analysis process. In unsupervised analysis, prior knowledge is unknown.\nClustering of gene expression data can be divided into two main categories: Gene-based clustering and Sample-based clustering. In gene based clustering, genes are treated as objects and samples are features or attributes for clustering. The goal of gene-based clustering is to identify differentially expressed genes and sets of genes or conditions with similar expression pattern or profiles, and to generate a list of expression measurements. In Sample based clustering, samples are treated as objects and genes are features for clustering. Sample based clustering can be used to reveal the phenotype structure or substructure of samples. Applying the conventional clustering methods to cluster samples using all the genes as features may degrade the quality and reliability of clustering results.\nClustering has been used in a number of applications such as engineering, biology, medicine and data mining. Cluster analysis of gene expression data has proved to be a useful tool for identifying co-expressed genes. DNA microarrays are emerged as the leading technology to measure gene expression levels primarily, because of their high throughput. Results from these experiments are usually presented in the form of a data matrix in which rows represent genes and columns represent conditions or samples [13]. Each entry in the matrix is a measure of the expression level of a particular gene under a specific condition. Analysis of these data sets reveals genes of unknown functions and the discovery of functional relationships between genes [19]. Co-expressed genes can be grouped into clusters based on their expression patterns of gene based clustering and Sample based clustering. In gene based clustering, the genes are treated as the objects, while the samples are the features. In sample based clustering, the samples can be partitioned into homogeneous groups where the genes are regarded as features and the samples as objects [20].\nDiscriminant analysis is now widely used in bioinformatics, such as distinguishing cancer tissues from normal tissues or one cancer subtype vs. another [4]. A critical issue in discriminant analysis is feature selection: instead of using all available variables (features or attributes) in the data, one selectively chooses a subset of features to be used in the discriminant system. There are number of advantages of feature selection: (1) dimension reduction to reduce the computational cost; (2) reduction of noise to improve the classification accuracy; (3) more interpretable features or characteristics that can help identify and monitor the target diseases or function types. These advantages are typified in DNA microarray gene expression profiles. Of the tens of thousands of genes in experiments, only a smaller number of them show strong correlation with the targeted phenotypes [4, 17].\nThe most popular clustering algorithms in microarray gene expression analysis are Hierarchical clustering, K-Means clustering [3], and SOM [9]. Of these K-Means clustering is very simple and fast efficient. Numerous methods have been proposed to solve clustering problem. The most popular clustering methods are K-Means clustering algorithm which is developed by Mac Queen [7]. The K-Means algorithm is effective in producing clusters for many practical applications. But the computational complexity of the original K-Means algorithm is very high, especially for large data sets. The KMeans clustering algorithm is a partitioning clustering method\nthat separates data into K groups. For the real life problems, the suitable number of clusters cannot be predicted. To overcome the above drawback the current research focused on developing the clustering algorithms without giving the initial number of clusters [2, 3, 5].\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents and overview of Gene based clustering Techniques. Section 3 describes the Unsupervised Clustering algorithms. Section 4 describes performance of Experimental analysis and discussion. Section 5 conclusion and future work.\nII. GENE BASED CLUSTERING TECHNIQUES\nThe purpose of clustering gene expression data is to reveal the natural structure inherent data and extracting useful information from noisy data. The two class cancer subtype classification problem, 50 informative genes are usually sufficient. There are studies suggesting that only a few genes are sufficient [4]. Thus, computation is reduced while prediction accuracy is increased via effective feature selection. When a small number of genes are selected, their biological relationship with the target diseases is more easily identified. These \"marker\" genes provide additional scientific understanding of the problem [8]. Selecting an effective and more representative feature set is the subject of this paper."}, {"heading": "A.

After the normalization of discretized value of gene gi at condition, tj is given the Gene Expression Data are normalizes then run on the discretized data.

We see in the above computation that the first condition, t1, is treated as a special case and its discretized value is directly based on gi, t1 i.e., the expression value at condition t1. For the rest of the conditions the discretized value is calculated by comparing its expression value with that of the previous value. This helps in finding whether the gene is up 1 or down -1 regulated at that particular condition. Each gene will now have a regulation pattern of 0, 1, and -1 across the conditions or time points. This pattern is represented as a string."}, {"heading": "B. Unsupervised Gene Selection", "text": "Gene selection is an important problem in the research of Gene expression data analysis. In some cases, too many redundant or missing values are there in gene expression data. In this section, an existing works of Velayutham and Thangavel et al proposed an algorithm of unsupervised feature selection (Unsupervised Quick Reduct algorithms) [21] is applied. This method is based on dependency measure using rough set theory.\nRough set theory can be regarded as a new mathematical tool for imperfect data analysis. The theory has found applications in many domains. Objects characterized by the same information are indiscernible (similar) in view of the available information about them. The indiscernibility relation generated in this way is the mathematical basis of rough set theory. Any set of all indiscernible (similar) objects is called an elementary set, and forms a basic granule (atom) of knowledge about the universe [17, 24]. Any union of some elementary sets is referred to as a crisp (precise) set \u2013 otherwise the set is rough (imprecise, vague). Rough set is a pair of precise sets, called the lower and the upper approximation of the rough set, and is associated. The lower approximation consists of all objects which surely belong to the set and the upper approximation contains all objects which possibly belong to the set. The difference between the upper and the lower approximation constitutes the boundary region of the rough set. From a data table are called columns of which are labeled by attributes, rows \u2013 by objects of interest and entries of the table are attribute values.\nIn data mining applications, decision class labels are often unknown or incomplete. In this situation the unsupervised feature selection is play vital role to select features."}, {"heading": "C.

K-Means Clustering", "text": "The main objective in cluster analysis is to group objects that are similar in one cluster and separate objects that are dissimilar by assigning them to different clusters. One of the most popular clustering methods is K-Means clustering algorithm [3, 9, 12]. It is classifies objects to a pre-defined number of clusters, which is given by the user (assume K clusters). The idea is to choose random cluster centers, one for each cluster. These centers are preferred to be as far as possible from each other. In this algorithm mostly Euclidean distance is used to find distance between data points and centroids [6, 13, 22]. The Euclidean distance between two multi-dimensional data points X = (x1, x2, x3, ..., xm) and Y = (y1, y2, y3, ..., ym) is described as follows\nD(X, Y) = (\ud835\udc651 \u2212 \ud835\udc661) 2 + (\ud835\udc652 \u2212 \ud835\udc662) 2 +\u22ef+ (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a \u2212 \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5a) 2\nThe K-Means method aims to minimize the sum of squared distances between all points and the cluster centre.

to simultaneously monitor the expression profiles of thousands of genes under various experimental conditions. Identification of co-expressed genes and coherent patterns is the central goal in microarray or gene expression data analysis and is an important task in bioinformatics research. Feature selection is a process to select features which are more informative. It is one of the important steps in knowledge discovery. The problem is that not all features are important. Some of the features may be redundant, and others may be irrelevant and noisy. In this work the unsupervised Gene selection method and Enhanced Center Initialization Algorithm (ECIA) with K-Means algorithms have been applied for clustering of Gene Expression Data. This proposed clustering algorithm overcomes the drawbacks in terms of specifying the optimal number of clusters and initialization of good cluster centroids. Gene Expression Data show that could identify compact clusters with performs well in terms of the Silhouette Coefficients cluster measure.
