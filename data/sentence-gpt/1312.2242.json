First, they are usually made up only of machine components; humans are only playing the role of user or supervisor. And yet, there are tasks in which the current state of the art of AI has much worse performance or is more expensive than humans: thus, it would be highly beneficial to have a systematic way of creating systems with both human and machine components, possibly with remote non-expert humans providing short-duration real-time services. Second, their components are often dedicated to only one system, and underutilized for a big part of their lifetime. Third, there is no inherent support for robust operation, and if a new better component becomes available, one cannot easily replace the old component. Fourth, they are viewed as a resource to be developed and owned, not as a utility. Thus, we are presenting CLIC: a framework for constructing cognitive systems that overcome the above limitations. The architecture of CLIC provides specific mechanisms for creating and operating cognitive systems that fulfill a set of desiderata: First, that are distributed yet situated, interacting with the physical world though sensing and actuation services, and that are also combining human as well as machine services. Second, that are made up of components that are time-shared and re-usable. Third, that provide increased robustness through self-repair. Fourth, that are constructed and reconstructed on the fly, with components that dynamically enter and exit the system during operation, on the basis of availability, pricing, and need. Importantly, fifth, the cognitive systems created and operated by CLIC do not need to be owned and can be provided on demand, as a utility; thus transforming human-machine situated intelligence to a service, and opening up many interesting opportunities. Fourth, that are maintained and operated by CLIC are designed to operate in a way that can sustain and sustain a high level of human-machine interactions. Fourth, that are designed to operate on a stable and consistent basis, and that are constructed with multiple human-machine interactions, in particular the ability to maintain and maintain systems that sustain or maintain the system, without being forced to compromise. Fourth, that are designed to operate on a predictable and reproducible basis, while maintaining the system, without being forced to compromise.

of \u00a0 common \u00a0 limitations. \u00a0 First, \u00a0 they \u00a0 are \u00a0 usually \u00a0 made \u00a0 up \u00a0 only \u00a0 of \u00a0 machine \u00a0 components; \u00a0humans \u00a0are \u00a0only \u00a0playing \u00a0the \u00a0role \u00a0of \u00a0user \u00a0or \u00a0supervisor. \u00a0 \u00a0And \u00a0yet, \u00a0there \u00a0 are \u00a0tasks \u00a0in \u00a0which \u00a0the \u00a0current \u00a0state \u00a0of \u00a0the \u00a0art \u00a0of \u00a0AI \u00a0has \u00a0much \u00a0worse \u00a0performance \u00a0or \u00a0 is \u00a0 more \u00a0 expensive \u00a0 than \u00a0 humans: \u00a0 thus, \u00a0 it \u00a0 would \u00a0 be \u00a0 highly \u00a0 beneficial \u00a0 to \u00a0 have \u00a0 a \u00a0 systematic \u00a0 way \u00a0 of \u00a0 creating \u00a0 systems \u00a0 with \u00a0 both \u00a0 human \u00a0 and \u00a0 machine \u00a0 components, \u00a0 possibly \u00a0 with \u00a0 remote \u00a0 non-\u2010expert \u00a0 humans \u00a0 providing \u00a0 snippets \u00a0 of \u00a0 some \u00a0 seconds \u00a0 of \u00a0 their \u00a0capacities \u00a0in \u00a0real-\u2010time. \u00a0Second, \u00a0their \u00a0components \u00a0are \u00a0specific \u00a0and \u00a0dedicated \u00a0to \u00a0 one \u00a0 and \u00a0 only \u00a0 one \u00a0 system, \u00a0 and \u00a0 are \u00a0 often \u00a0 underutilized \u00a0 for \u00a0 significant \u00a0 fractions \u00a0 of \u00a0 their \u00a0 lifetime. \u00a0 Third, \u00a0 there \u00a0 is \u00a0 no \u00a0 inherent \u00a0 support \u00a0 for \u00a0 robust, \u00a0 fault-\u2010tolerant \u00a0 operation, \u00a0 and \u00a0 if \u00a0 a \u00a0 new \u00a0 component \u00a0 becomes \u00a0 available, \u00a0 with \u00a0 better \u00a0 performance \u00a0 and/or \u00a0cheaper \u00a0cost, \u00a0one \u00a0cannot \u00a0easily \u00a0replace \u00a0the \u00a0old \u00a0component. \u00a0Fourth, \u00a0and \u00a0quite \u00a0 importantly \u00a0in \u00a0terms \u00a0of \u00a0their \u00a0economics, \u00a0they \u00a0are \u00a0viewed \u00a0as \u00a0a \u00a0resource \u00a0that

\u00a0demand. \u00a0 \u00a0 Motivated \u00a0 by \u00a0 the \u00a0 above \u00a0 state \u00a0 of \u00a0 affairs, \u00a0 in \u00a0 this \u00a0 paper \u00a0 we \u00a0 are \u00a0 presenting \u00a0 CLIC: \u00a0 a \u00a0 framework \u00a0for \u00a0constructing \u00a0cognitive \u00a0systems \u00a0that \u00a0overcome \u00a0the \u00a0above \u00a0mentioned \u00a0 limitations. \u00a0With \u00a0 the \u00a0 four-\u2010layer \u00a0 software \u00a0 architecture \u00a0 of \u00a0 CLIC, \u00a0we \u00a0 provide \u00a0 specific \u00a0 yet \u00a0 extensible \u00a0 mechanisms \u00a0 that \u00a0 enable \u00a0 the \u00a0 creation \u00a0 and \u00a0 operation \u00a0 of \u00a0 distributed \u00a0 cognitive \u00a0systems \u00a0that \u00a0fulfill \u00a0the \u00a0following \u00a0desiderata: \u00a0First, \u00a0that \u00a0are \u00a0distributed \u00a0yet \u00a0 situated, \u00a0interacting \u00a0with \u00a0the \u00a0physical \u00a0world \u00a0though \u00a0sensing \u00a0and \u00a0actuation \u00a0services, \u00a0 and \u00a0 that \u00a0 are \u00a0 also \u00a0 combining \u00a0 services \u00a0 provided \u00a0 by \u00a0 humans \u00a0 as \u00a0 well \u00a0 as \u00a0 services \u00a0 implemented \u00a0by \u00a0machines. \u00a0Second, \u00a0that \u00a0are \u00a0made \u00a0up \u00a0of \u00a0components \u00a0that \u00a0are \u00a0time-\u2010 shared \u00a0 and \u00a0 re-\u2010usable \u00a0 across \u00a0 systems. \u00a0 Third, \u00a0 that \u00a0 provide \u00a0 increased \u00a0 robustness \u00a0 through \u00a0self-\u2010repair \u00a0mechanisms. \u00a0Fourth, \u00a0that \u00a0are \u00a0constructed \u00a0and \u00a0reconstructed \u00a0on \u00a0 the \u00a0 fly, \u00a0 with \u00a0 components \u00a0 that \u00a0 dynamically \u00a0 enter \u00a0 and \u00a0 exit \u00a0 the \u00a0 system, \u00a0 while \u00a0 the \u00a0 system \u00a0 is \u00a0 in \u00a0 operation, \u00a0 on \u00a0 the \u00a0 basis \u00a0 of \u00a0 availability, \u00a0 and \u00a0 pricing, \u00a0 and \u00a0 need. \u00a0 Quite \u00a0 importantly, \u00a0fifth, \u00a0the \u00a0cognitive \u00a0systems \u00a0created \u00a0and \u00a0operated \u00a0by \u00a0CLIC \u00a0do \u00a0not \u00a0need \u00a0 to \u00a0 be \u00a0 owned \u00a0 and \u00a0 can \u00a0 be \u00a0 provided \u00a0 on \u00a0 demand, \u00a0 as \u00a0 a \u00a0 utility \u00a0 \u2013 \u00a0 thus \u00a0 transforming \u00a0 human-\u2010machine \u00a0 situated \u00a0 intelligence \u00a0 to \u00a0 a \u00a0 service, \u00a0 and \u00a0 opening \u00a0 up \u00a0 numerous \u00a0 interesting \u00a0research \u00a0directions \u00a0and \u00a0application \u00a0opportunities. \u00a0\n1. \u00a0Introduction \u00a0\nTraditionally, \u00a0most \u00a0of \u00a0the \u00a0cognitive \u00a0systems \u00a0that \u00a0have \u00a0been \u00a0engineered \u00a0in \u00a0the \u00a0past, \u00a0 have \u00a0had \u00a0a \u00a0number \u00a0of \u00a0common \u00a0characteristics. \u00a0First, \u00a0they \u00a0were \u00a0primarily \u00a0composed \u00a0 of \u00a0electronic \u00a0or \u00a0machine \u00a0elements; \u00a0and \u00a0not \u00a0human \u00a0elements. \u00a0For \u00a0example, \u00a0consider \u00a0 the \u00a0case \u00a0of \u00a0an \u00a0intelligent \u00a0robot \u00a0equipped \u00a0with \u00a0vision \u00a0that \u00a0aims \u00a0to \u00a0fulfill \u00a0a \u00a0mechanical \u00a0 task \u00a0\u2013 \u00a0search \u00a0for \u00a0a \u00a0certain \u00a0kind \u00a0of \u00a0object, \u00a0 fetch, \u00a0and \u00a0place \u00a0it \u00a0at \u00a0a \u00a0specific \u00a0container. \u00a0 Such \u00a0a \u00a0system \u00a0is \u00a0comprised \u00a0of \u00a0electronic \u00a0sensing \u00a0components \u00a0(camera, \u00a0sonars \u00a0etc.), \u00a0 electronic \u00a0 cognition \u00a0 components \u00a0 (software \u00a0 components \u00a0 performing \u00a0 pattern \u00a0 recognition, \u00a0planning, \u00a0motor \u00a0control \u00a0etc.), \u00a0and \u00a0electromechanical \u00a0actuation: \u00a0an \u00a0arm \u00a0 with \u00a0 a \u00a0 gripper, \u00a0 which \u00a0 fetches \u00a0 and \u00a0 places \u00a0 objects. \u00a0 Notice \u00a0 that \u00a0 there \u00a0 are \u00a0no \u00a0human \u00a0 components \u00a0within \u00a0such \u00a0a \u00a0cognitive \u00a0system; \u00a0even \u00a0if \u00a0the \u00a0system \u00a0was \u00a0interacting \u00a0with \u00a0 a \u00a0human, \u00a0the \u00a0human \u00a0is \u00a0not \u00a0part \u00a0of \u00a0the \u00a0sensory, \u00a0cognitive \u00a0or \u00a0actuation \u00a0components \u00a0of \u00a0 the \u00a0system; \u00a0but \u00a0rather \u00a0has \u00a0the \u00a0role \u00a0of \u00a0a \u00a0supervisor, \u00a0controller, \u00a0or \u00a0collaborator \u00a0which \u00a0 is \u00a0external \u00a0to \u00a0the \u00a0cognitive \u00a0system \u00a0itself. \u00a0Second, \u00a0notice \u00a0that \u00a0the \u00a0actual \u00a0components \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 cognitive \u00a0 system \u00a0 (in \u00a0 this \u00a0 case, \u00a0 a \u00a0 robot) \u00a0 that \u00a0 was \u00a0 just \u00a0 described \u00a0 are \u00a0 all \u00a0 physically \u00a0 part \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 system \u00a0 itself; \u00a0 they \u00a0 are \u00a0 not \u00a0 spatially \u00a0 distributed, \u00a0 and \u00a0 furthermore, \u00a0 they \u00a0 are \u00a0 specific \u00a0 to \u00a0 this \u00a0 system \u00a0 (robot) \u00a0 and \u00a0 dedicate \u00a0 all \u00a0 of \u00a0 their \u00a0 operating \u00a0time \u00a0to \u00a0this \u00a0robot. \u00a0I.e. \u00a0they \u00a0are \u00a0usually \u00a0neither \u00a0distant, \u00a0nor \u00a0distributed, \u00a0and \u00a0 neither \u00a0 time-\u2010shared \u00a0 nor \u00a0 reused \u00a0 for \u00a0 various \u00a0 cognitive \u00a0 systems. \u00a0 Furthermore, \u00a0 the \u00a0 components \u00a0not \u00a0only \u00a0do \u00a0not \u00a0partake \u00a0to \u00a0different \u00a0cognitive \u00a0systems, \u00a0but \u00a0the \u00a0cognitive \u00a0 system \u00a0is \u00a0dependent \u00a0on \u00a0them \u00a0throughout \u00a0its \u00a0operating \u00a0time; \u00a0if \u00a0a \u00a0sensor \u00a0fails, \u00a0there \u00a0is \u00a0 no \u00a0graceful \u00a0way \u00a0for \u00a0it \u00a0to \u00a0be \u00a0replaced \u00a0without \u00a0disrupting \u00a0the \u00a0operation \u00a0of \u00a0the \u00a0system. \u00a0 Thus, \u00a0 there \u00a0 is \u00a0 no \u00a0 inherent \u00a0 support \u00a0 for \u00a0 robust, \u00a0 fault-\u2010tolerant \u00a0 operation, \u00a0 and \u00a0 furthermore, \u00a0 if \u00a0 a \u00a0 new \u00a0 component \u00a0 (for \u00a0 example, \u00a0 camera \u00a0 or \u00a0 pattern \u00a0 recognition \u00a0 algorithm \u00a0 becomes \u00a0 available, \u00a0 with \u00a0 better \u00a0 performance \u00a0 and/or \u00a0 cheaper \u00a0 cost, \u00a0 one \u00a0 cannot \u00a0easily \u00a0replace \u00a0the \u00a0old \u00a0component. \u00a0 The \u00a0motivation \u00a0behind \u00a0this \u00a0paper \u00a0is \u00a0to \u00a0contribute \u00a0to \u00a0improving \u00a0the \u00a0above-\u2010described \u00a0 state \u00a0of \u00a0affairs. \u00a0We \u00a0address \u00a0the \u00a0following \u00a0questions: \u00a0How \u00a0can \u00a0the \u00a0cognitive \u00a0systems \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 future \u00a0 exhibit \u00a0 improved \u00a0 characteristics? \u00a0 Can \u00a0 they \u00a0 consist \u00a0 also \u00a0 of \u00a0 human \u00a0 components, \u00a0given \u00a0that \u00a0 for \u00a0some \u00a0cases \u00a0 they \u00a0exhibit \u00a0better \u00a0performance \u00a0and/or \u00a0are \u00a0 more \u00a0 readily \u00a0 available \u00a0 than \u00a0 electronic \u00a0 elements? \u00a0 For \u00a0 example: \u00a0 humans \u00a0 are \u00a0much \u00a0 better \u00a0 in \u00a0 performing \u00a0 activity \u00a0 recognition \u00a0 as \u00a0 compared \u00a0 to \u00a0 the \u00a0 state-\u2010of-\u2010the \u00a0 art \u00a0 automated \u00a0 systems \u00a0 (better \u00a0 performance). \u00a0 Another \u00a0 example \u00a0 is \u00a0 that \u00a0 of \u00a0 a \u00a0 human \u00a0 observer \u00a0next \u00a0to \u00a0a \u00a0broken \u00a0traffic \u00a0camera, \u00a0who \u00a0can \u00a0be \u00a0useful \u00a0acting \u00a0as \u00a0a \u00a0sensor \u00a0that \u00a0 reports \u00a0 traffic \u00a0 conditions \u00a0 (availability). \u00a0 Based \u00a0 on \u00a0 this \u00a0 the \u00a0 following \u00a0 questions \u00a0 are \u00a0 raised \u00a0up: \u00a0Can \u00a0 the \u00a0 cognitive \u00a0 systems \u00a0of \u00a0 the \u00a0 future \u00a0 include \u00a0distributed \u00a0 components \u00a0 that \u00a0are \u00a0time-\u2010shared \u00a0and \u00a0re-\u2010used \u00a0 for \u00a0various \u00a0systems, \u00a0and \u00a0also \u00a0enable \u00a0much \u00a0higher \u00a0 robustness \u00a0and \u00a0flexibility? \u00a0For \u00a0example \u00a0\u2013 \u00a0why \u00a0should \u00a0the \u00a0surveillance \u00a0cameras \u00a0of \u00a0a \u00a0 city \u00a0 be \u00a0 dedicated \u00a0 only \u00a0 to \u00a0 surveillance, \u00a0 and \u00a0why \u00a0 can \u00a0 they \u00a0 not \u00a0 be \u00a0 reused \u00a0 for \u00a0 other \u00a0 purposes \u00a0 too? \u00a0 Can \u00a0 we \u00a0 even \u00a0 reach \u00a0 a \u00a0 stage, \u00a0 where \u00a0 one \u00a0 is \u00a0 able \u00a0 to \u00a0 offer \u00a0 situated \u00a0 cognitive \u00a0systems \u00a0as \u00a0an \u00a0on-\u2010demand \u00a0service, \u00a0on

\u00a0 large \u00a0 red \u00a0 balloons \u00a0 were \u00a0 placed \u00a0 in \u00a0 locations \u00a0 around \u00a0 the \u00a0 United \u00a0 States, \u00a0 with \u00a0 their \u00a0 location \u00a0

\u00a0for \u00a0 the \u00a0 system \u00a0 to \u00a0determine \u00a0 the \u00a0 location \u00a0of \u00a0 the \u00a0balloons, \u00a0 see \u00a0Tang \u00a0et \u00a0 al. \u00a0 [Tan11]. \u00a0One \u00a0 can \u00a0 view \u00a0 the \u00a0 system \u00a0 that \u00a0 was \u00a0 created \u00a0 as \u00a0 a \u00a0massive \u00a0 distributed \u00a0 cognitive \u00a0 system: \u00a0 with \u00a0 sensing \u00a0

this \u00a0 system \u00a0 the \u00a0 components \u00a0 are \u00a0 human \u00a0 as \u00a0well \u00a0 as \u00a0machine, \u00a0 they \u00a0 are \u00a0 distant \u00a0 (spread \u00a0 over \u00a0 a \u00a0 large \u00a0 geographical \u00a0 area). \u00a0 Furthermore, \u00a0 the \u00a0 human \u00a0 components \u00a0 are \u00a0not \u00a0dedicated \u00a0 to \u00a0 the \u00a0 system \u00a0 (i.e. \u00a0 the \u00a0 humans \u00a0 that \u00a0 spent \u00a0 10 \u00a0 seconds \u00a0 of \u00a0 their \u00a0 time \u00a0 looking \u00a0 around \u00a0 for \u00a0 a \u00a0 balloon \u00a0are \u00a0also \u00a0using

\u00a0false-\u2010reports \u00a0can \u00a0be \u00a0crossed-\u2010out \u00a0of \u00a0the \u00a0system \u00a0through \u00a0 the \u00a0 special \u00a0 algorithms \u00a0 used \u00a0 and \u00a0 through \u00a0 the \u00a0 inherent \u00a0 redundancy \u00a0 in \u00a0 sensing \u00a0 resources. \u00a0 But \u00a0 there \u00a0 are \u00a0 also \u00a0many \u00a0 other \u00a0 recent \u00a0 developments \u00a0 of \u00a0 a \u00a0 similar \u00a0 nature: \u00a0 Another \u00a0 notable \u00a0 example \u00a0 is \u00a0 Von \u00a0 Ahn's \u00a0 [Ahn08] \u00a0 ingenious \u00a0 CAPTCHA-\u2010breaker \u00a0 scheme. \u00a0 CAPTCHAs \u00a0are \u00a0often \u00a0used \u00a0in \u00a0order \u00a0to \u00a0stop \u00a0spam \u00a0email \u00a0programs \u00a0and \u00a0other \u00a0bots \u00a0from \u00a0 creating \u00a0thousands \u00a0of \u00a0email \u00a0accounts \u00a0in \u00a0order \u00a0to \u00a0propagate \u00a0spam. \u00a0They \u00a0are \u00a0usually \u00a0 strings \u00a0 of \u00a0 letters \u00a0 and \u00a0 numbers, \u00a0 with \u00a0 character \u00a0 sets \u00a0 that \u00a0 contain \u00a0 geometric \u00a0 distortions \u00a0 and \u00a0 occlusions. \u00a0 The \u00a0 characters \u00a0 in \u00a0 the \u00a0 CAPTCHAs \u00a0 are \u00a0 very \u00a0 easy \u00a0 for \u00a0 humans \u00a0to \u00a0recognize; \u00a0however, \u00a0they \u00a0are \u00a0quite \u00a0difficult \u00a0for \u00a0machines, \u00a0given \u00a0the \u00a0state \u00a0 of \u00a0the \u00a0art \u00a0of \u00a0Optical \u00a0Character \u00a0Recognition \u00a0(OCR). \u00a0Thus, \u00a0a \u00a0solution \u00a0towards \u00a0breaking \u00a0 CAPTCHAs, \u00a0 involves \u00a0 finding \u00a0 non-\u2010expert \u00a0 humans \u00a0 online, \u00a0 and \u00a0 incentivizing \u00a0 them \u00a0 adequately, \u00a0 so \u00a0 that \u00a0 they \u00a0break \u00a0 the \u00a0CAPTCHA \u00a0 (by \u00a0 recognizing \u00a0 the \u00a0 characters) \u00a0with \u00a0 the \u00a0answer \u00a0collected \u00a0by \u00a0the \u00a0spam \u00a0mailer \u00a0program, \u00a0which \u00a0opens \u00a0the \u00a0accounts \u00a0right \u00a0 away. \u00a0 The \u00a0 humans \u00a0 effectively \u00a0 lend \u00a0 some \u00a0 seconds \u00a0 of \u00a0 their \u00a0 mind \u00a0 to \u00a0 the \u00a0 system, \u00a0 performing \u00a0 the \u00a0 cognitive \u00a0 service \u00a0 of \u00a0 character \u00a0 recognition \u00a0 for \u00a0 it, \u00a0 incentivized \u00a0 by \u00a0 illegal \u00a0 downloads \u00a0 that \u00a0 the \u00a0 system \u00a0 offers \u00a0 to \u00a0 them \u00a0 in \u00a0 return \u00a0 for \u00a0 their \u00a0 services. \u00a0 In \u00a0 essence, \u00a0 a \u00a0 large \u00a0 distributed \u00a0 cognitive \u00a0 system \u00a0 is \u00a0 effectively \u00a0 created \u00a0 consisting \u00a0 of \u00a0 human \u00a0as \u00a0well \u00a0as

\u00a0Red \u00a0Balloons \u00a0challenge. \u00a0 Finally, \u00a0 we \u00a0 consider \u00a0 a \u00a0 third \u00a0 recent \u00a0 development, \u00a0 the \u00a0 cloud \u00a0 computing \u00a0 paradigm. \u00a0 Traditionally, \u00a0 computation \u00a0 required \u00a0 ownership \u00a0 of \u00a0 resources: \u00a0 computers, \u00a0 storage \u00a0 space, \u00a0and \u00a0software. \u00a0With \u00a0cloud \u00a0computing, \u00a0computation \u00a0is \u00a0viewed \u00a0as \u00a0a \u00a0utility. \u00a0What \u00a0 do \u00a0we \u00a0mean \u00a0by \u00a0\u201cutility\u201d? \u00a0In \u00a0a \u00a0similar

\u00a0 is \u00a0 to \u00a0 provide \u00a0 a \u00a0 conceptual \u00a0 framework \u00a0 to \u00a0 integrate \u00a0 ideas, \u00a0 constructs, \u00a0 architectures \u00a0 and \u00a0 techniques \u00a0 from

to \u00a0 mid-\u2010level \u00a0Blueprint \u00a0descriptions, \u00a0which \u00a0can \u00a0be \u00a0sent \u00a0to \u00a0Layer \u00a02 \u00a0for \u00a0procurement \u00a0and \u00a0 operation, \u00a0 i.e. \u00a0 effectively \u00a0 aiding \u00a0 in \u00a0 the \u00a0 translation \u00a0 of \u00a0 high-\u2010level \u00a0 teleological \u00a0 descriptions \u00a0to \u00a0mid-\u2010level \u00a0structural. \u00a0 Now, \u00a0 let \u00a0 us \u00a0 move \u00a0 to \u00a0 Goal \u00a0 Arbitration. \u00a0 While \u00a0 a \u00a0 certain \u00a0 cognitive \u00a0 system \u00a0 is \u00a0 in \u00a0 operation, \u00a0 one \u00a0 might \u00a0 able \u00a0 to \u00a0 externally \u00a0 dynamically \u00a0 specify \u00a0 parameters \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 current \u00a0goal \u00a0that \u00a0it \u00a0is \u00a0trying \u00a0to \u00a0pursue. \u00a0For \u00a0example, \u00a0in \u00a0a \u00a0traffic \u00a0control \u00a0scenario, \u00a0the \u00a0 corresponding \u00a0system \u00a0would \u00a0have \u00a0to \u00a0serve \u00a0two \u00a0kinds \u00a0of \u00a0goals: \u00a0(a) \u00a0preset \u00a0ones, \u00a0such \u00a0 as \u00a0 reducing \u00a0 traffic \u00a0 congestion \u00a0 as \u00a0well \u00a0 as \u00a0 pollution, \u00a0 and \u00a0 (b) \u00a0 dynamic \u00a0 ones, \u00a0 such \u00a0 as \u00a0 maximizing \u00a0 the \u00a0 satisfaction \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 drivers \u00a0 who \u00a0 have \u00a0 declared \u00a0 their \u00a0 own \u00a0 desired \u00a0 destination \u00a0points, \u00a0by \u00a0reducing \u00a0transit \u00a0time \u00a0etc. \u00a0The \u00a0total \u00a0goal \u00a0of \u00a0the \u00a0system \u00a0can \u00a0be \u00a0 viewed \u00a0 as \u00a0 a \u00a0 composite \u00a0 of \u00a0 all \u00a0 the \u00a0 above \u00a0 dynamic \u00a0 goals \u00a0 as \u00a0well \u00a0 as \u00a0 its \u00a0 preset \u00a0 goals. \u00a0 Many \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 component \u00a0 goals \u00a0 are \u00a0 antagonistic, \u00a0 or \u00a0 even \u00a0worse, \u00a0might \u00a0 be \u00a0mutually \u00a0 impossible. \u00a0 Thus, \u00a0 the \u00a0 purpose \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 goal \u00a0 arbitrator \u00a0 is \u00a0 to \u00a0 be \u00a0 able \u00a0 to \u00a0 create \u00a0 a \u00a0 satisfactory \u00a0composite \u00a0goal, \u00a0in \u00a0view \u00a0of \u00a0these \u00a0potential \u00a0discrepancies. \u00a0 Last \u00a0but \u00a0not \u00a0 least, \u00a0after \u00a0this \u00a0more \u00a0detailed \u00a0conceptual \u00a0 introduction \u00a0to \u00a0CLIC, \u00a0and \u00a0its \u00a0 layers \u00a0 of \u00a0 mechanisms, \u00a0 as \u00a0 well \u00a0 as \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 Cognitive \u00a0 System \u00a0 specifications \u00a0 and \u00a0 its \u00a0 creation \u00a0 and \u00a0 operation \u00a0 processes, \u00a0 it \u00a0 is \u00a0 worth \u00a0 commenting \u00a0 upon \u00a0 one \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 main \u00a0 resulting \u00a0 changes \u00a0 catalyzed \u00a0 by \u00a0 CLIC: \u00a0 Through \u00a0 CLIC, \u00a0 the \u00a0 creation \u00a0 and \u00a0 operation \u00a0 of \u00a0 Cognitive \u00a0Systems \u00a0is \u00a0transformed \u00a0to \u00a0a \u00a0utility \u00a0provided \u00a0on-\u2010demand; \u00a0which \u00a0would \u00a0lead \u00a0 to \u00a0 an \u00a0 increase \u00a0 of \u00a0 component \u00a0 utilization \u00a0 and \u00a0 thus \u00a0 potentially \u00a0 to \u00a0 large \u00a0 economic \u00a0 consequences. \u00a0 For \u00a0 example, \u00a0 one \u00a0 does \u00a0 not \u00a0 need \u00a0 to \u00a0 own \u00a0 extensive \u00a0 sensor \u00a0 networks \u00a0 (for \u00a0example \u00a0cameras \u00a0 in \u00a0wide \u00a0areas) \u00a0 in \u00a0order \u00a0 to \u00a0be \u00a0able \u00a0 to \u00a0operate \u00a0services \u00a0using \u00a0 them; \u00a0 they \u00a0 can \u00a0 be \u00a0 time-\u2010shared \u00a0 and \u00a0 procured \u00a0 on \u00a0 demand, \u00a0 when \u00a0 and \u00a0 if \u00a0 they \u00a0 are \u00a0 needed. \u00a0The \u00a0same \u00a0holds \u00a0for \u00a0processing \u00a0and \u00a0actuation \u00a0services; \u00a0in \u00a0this \u00a0way, \u00a0an \u00a0open \u00a0 market \u00a0 of \u00a0 component \u00a0 services \u00a0 is \u00a0 created. \u00a0We \u00a0 are \u00a0 thus \u00a0 envisioning \u00a0 a \u00a0world \u00a0where \u00a0 processing \u00a0 code \u00a0 can \u00a0 run \u00a0 in \u00a0machines \u00a0 in \u00a0 various \u00a0 locations, \u00a0 expert \u00a0 and \u00a0 non-\u2010expert \u00a0 humans \u00a0provide \u00a0crowd-\u2010servicing \u00a0in \u00a0time-\u2010slices \u00a0of \u00a0seconds, \u00a0and \u00a0furthermore \u00a0robots \u00a0 and \u00a0sensor \u00a0networks \u00a0can \u00a0be \u00a0freely

\u00a0 initiative \u00a0 (OSGi) \u00a0 framework, \u00a0 a \u00a0 platform \u00a0 for \u00a0 the \u00a0 Java \u00a0 programming \u00a0 language. \u00a0 OSGi \u00a0 foresees \u00a0 dynamic \u00a0

components \u00a0 in \u00a0 Ambient \u00a0 Intelligence \u00a0 [DVC08]. \u00a0 Similar \u00a0 frameworks \u00a0 have \u00a0 been \u00a0 developed \u00a0 in \u00a0 robotics, \u00a0 where \u00a0 many \u00a0 popular \u00a0 integration \u00a0 frameworks \u00a0facilitate \u00a0inter-\u2010component \u00a0communication \u00a0by \u00a0providing \u00a0middleware \u00a0for \u00a0 the \u00a0 exchange

\u00a0very \u00a0popular, \u00a0 example \u00a0 [QBN07], \u00a0 although \u00a0 this \u00a0 approach \u00a0is \u00a0ubiquitous \u00a0in \u00a0robotics. \u00a0 Although \u00a0 very \u00a0 similar \u00a0 to \u00a0 the \u00a0CLIC \u00a0 vision, \u00a0 such \u00a0 approaches \u00a0 lack \u00a0 the \u00a0 scalability \u00a0 and \u00a0 openness \u00a0 of \u00a0 CLIC \u00a0 where \u00a0 we \u00a0 foresee \u00a0 a \u00a0 global \u00a0 market \u00a0 of \u00a0 amalgamated \u00a0 human-\u2010 machine \u00a0 services, \u00a0 radically \u00a0 heterogeneous \u00a0 and \u00a0 pushing \u00a0 beyond \u00a0 the \u00a0 confines \u00a0 of \u00a0 a \u00a0 single \u00a0smart \u00a0home \u00a0or \u00a0smart \u00a0lab \u00a0or \u00a0robotic \u00a0platform. \u00a0For \u00a0CLIC, \u00a0the \u00a0infrastructure \u00a0as \u00a0a \u00a0\nservice \u00a0 (IaaS) \u00a0 paradigm \u00a0 is \u00a0 a \u00a0 more \u00a0 promising \u00a0 starting \u00a0 point, \u00a0 as \u00a0 it \u00a0 circumvents \u00a0 centralized \u00a0 middleware \u00a0 for \u00a0 data \u00a0 exchange \u00a0 and \u00a0 follows \u00a0 an \u00a0 approach \u00a0 where \u00a0 components \u00a0expose \u00a0interfaces \u00a0through \u00a0which \u00a0to \u00a0directly \u00a0communicate. \u00a0 Naturally \u00a0 IaaS \u00a0 operates \u00a0 at \u00a0 a \u00a0 very \u00a0 low \u00a0 layer, \u00a0 where \u00a0 the \u00a0 only \u00a0 service \u00a0 offered \u00a0 is \u00a0 a \u00a0 virtual \u00a0 machine; \u00a0 however \u00a0 IaaS \u00a0 software \u00a0 such \u00a0 as \u00a0 Eucalyptus \u00a0 implements \u00a0 considerable \u00a0 functionality \u00a0 needed \u00a0 in \u00a0 CLIC; \u00a0 a \u00a0 Eucalyptus \u00a0 cloud \u00a0 has \u00a0 a \u00a0 (possibly \u00a0 distributed) \u00a0 cloud \u00a0 controller \u00a0 which \u00a0 handles \u00a0 registering \u00a0 and \u00a0 deregistering \u00a0 physical \u00a0 hosts, \u00a0 virtual \u00a0machines, \u00a0 and \u00a0 storage, \u00a0 changing \u00a0 properties \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 virtual \u00a0machines, \u00a0 and \u00a0 querying \u00a0 about \u00a0 existing \u00a0 resources. \u00a0 The \u00a0 cloud \u00a0 controller \u00a0 connects \u00a0 to \u00a0 the \u00a0 individual \u00a0node \u00a0controllers \u00a0 in \u00a0 each \u00a0physical \u00a0machine, \u00a0 to \u00a0know \u00a0 if \u00a0 things \u00a0are \u00a0up \u00a0and \u00a0 running \u00a0 and \u00a0 to \u00a0 apply \u00a0 changes. \u00a0 Furthermore, \u00a0 elastic \u00a0 storage \u00a0 is \u00a0 implemented \u00a0 as \u00a0 a \u00a0 software \u00a0as \u00a0a \u00a0service \u00a0(SaaS) \u00a0facility \u00a0where \u00a0access \u00a0to \u00a0a \u00a0(distributed, \u00a0variable \u00a0size) \u00a0data \u00a0 store \u00a0 is \u00a0 provided \u00a0 over \u00a0 an \u00a0 API \u00a0 and

\u00a0 and \u00a0 behaviors. \u00a0 The \u00a0 second \u00a0 challenge \u00a0(C2) \u00a0is \u00a0how \u00a0to \u00a0arbitrate \u00a0multiple \u00a0goals \u00a0which \u00a0might \u00a0also \u00a0be \u00a0coming \u00a0from \u00a0 within \u00a0the \u00a0cognitive \u00a0system \u00a0itself, \u00a0thus \u00a0enabling \u00a0partial \u00a0auto-\u2010telicity. \u00a0 Both \u00a0of \u00a0 these \u00a0are \u00a0key \u00a0challenges, \u00a0but \u00a0at \u00a0 least \u00a0the \u00a0first \u00a0one \u00a0 is \u00a0not \u00a0within \u00a0easy \u00a0reach \u00a0 from \u00a0today\u2019s \u00a0state

\u00a0Layer \u00a0L3; \u00a0and \u00a0 this \u00a0can \u00a0be \u00a0indeed \u00a0the \u00a0case, \u00a0as \u00a0long \u00a0as \u00a0the \u00a0specification \u00a0of \u00a0the \u00a0desired

\u00a0 Regarding \u00a0 L3a, \u00a0 of \u00a0 particular \u00a0 importance \u00a0 are \u00a0 existing \u00a0 theories \u00a0 and \u00a0 techniques \u00a0 that \u00a0 are \u00a0related \u00a0to

\u00a0[HHK00]). \u00a0The \u00a0underlying \u00a0assumption \u00a0is \u00a0that \u00a0in \u00a0many \u00a0cases \u00a0cognition \u00a0extends \u00a0 beyond \u00a0what \u00a0 is \u00a0 going \u00a0 on

\u00a0or \u00a0between \u00a0multiple \u00a0artificial \u00a0systems. \u00a0Most \u00a0of \u00a0this \u00a0research \u00a0is \u00a0still \u00a0guided \u00a0 by \u00a0 the \u00a0 traditional \u00a0

\u00a0this \u00a0perspective, \u00a0CLIC \u00a0goes \u00a0beyond \u00a0the \u00a0state \u00a0of \u00a0the \u00a0 art \u00a0 by \u00a0 importing \u00a0 the \u00a0 idea \u00a0 of \u00a0 distributed
