Introduction", "text": "Online learning is an effective way to deal with large-scale applications, especially applications with streaming data. Among the popular algorithms, online Passive-Aggressive (PA) learning (Crammer et al., 2006) provides a generic framework for online large-margin learning, with many applications (McDonald et al., 2005; Chiang et al., 2008). Though enjoying strong discriminative ability suitable for predictive tasks, existing online PA methods are formulated as a point estimate problem by optimizing some deterministic objective function. This may lead to some inconvenience. For example, a single large-margin model is often less than sufficient in describing complex data, such as those with rich underlying structures.\nProceedings of the 31 st International Conference on Machine Learning, Beijing, China, 2014. JMLR: W&CP volume 32. Copyright 2014 by the author(s).\nOn the other hand, Bayesian methods enjoy great flexibility in describing the possible underlying structures of complex data. Moreover, the recent progress on nonparametric Bayesian methods (Hjort, 2010; Teh et al., 2006a) further provides an increasingly important framework that allows the Bayesian models to have an unbounded model complexity, e.g., an infinite number of components in a mixture model (Hjort, 2010) or an infinite number of units in a latent feature model (Ghahramani & Griffiths, 2005), and to adapt when the learning environment changes. For Bayesian models, one challenging problem is posterior inference, for which both variational and Monte Carlo methods can be too expensive to be applied to large-scale applications. To scale up Bayesian inference, much progress has been made on developing online variational Bayes (Hoffman et al., 2010; Mimno et al., 2012) and online Monte Carlo (Ahn et al., 2012) methods. However, due to the generative nature, Bayesian models are lack of the discriminative ability of large-margin methods and usually less than sufficient in performing discriminative tasks.\nSuccessful attempts have been made to bring large-margin learning and Bayesian methods together. For example, maximum entropy discrimination (MED) (Jaakkola et al., 1999) made a significant advance in conjoining maxmargin learning and Bayesian generative models, mainly in the context of supervised learning and structured output prediction (Zhu & Xing, 2009). Recently, much attention has been focused on generalizing MED to incorporate latent variables and perform nonparametric Bayesian inference, in many contexts including topic modeling (Zhu et al., 2012), matrix factorization (Xu et al., 2012), and multi-task learning (Jebara, 2011; Zhu et al., 2011). However, posterior inference in such models remain a big challenge. It is desirable to develop efficient online algorithms for these Bayesian max-margin models.\nTo address the above problems of both the existing online PA algorithms and Bayesian max-margin models, this paper presents online Bayesian Passive-Aggressive (BayesPA) learning, a general framework of performing\nar X\niv :1\n31 2.\n33 88\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n1 2\nD ec\n2 01\nonline learning for Bayesian max-margin models. We show that online BayesPA subsumes the standard online PA when the underlying model is linear and the parameter prior is Gaussian. We further show that another major significance of BayesPA is its natural generalization to incorporate latent variables and to perform nonparametric Bayesian inference, thus allowing online BayesPA to have the great flexibility of (nonparametric) Bayesian methods for explorative analysis as well as the strong discriminative ability of large-margin learning for predictive tasks. As concrete examples, we apply the theory of online BayesPA to topic modeling and derive efficient online learning algorithms for max-margin supervised topic models (Zhu et al., 2012). We further develop efficient online learning algorithms for the nonparametric max-margin topic models, an extension of the nonparametric topic models (Teh et al., 2006a; Wang et al., 2011) for predictive tasks. Extensive empirical results on real data sets show significant improvements on time efficiency and maintenance of comparable results with the batch counterparts."}, {"heading": "2. Bayesian Passive-Aggressive Learning", "text": "In this section, we present a general perspective on online max-margin Bayesian inference."}, {"heading": "2.1. Online PA Learning", "text": "The goal of online supervised learning is to minimize the cumulative loss for a certain prediction task from the sequentially arriving training samples. Online PassiveAggressive (PA) algorithms (Crammer et al., 2006) achieve this goal by updating some parameterized model w (e.g., the weights of a linear SVM) in an online manner with the instantaneous losses from arriving data {xt}t\u22650 and corresponding responses {yt}t\u22650. The losses ` (w;xt, yt), as they consider, could be the hinge loss ( \u2212 ytw>xt)+ for binary classification or the -insensitive loss (|yt \u2212 w>xt| \u2212 )+ for regression, where is a hyper-parameter and (x)+ = max(0, x). The Passive-Aggressive update rule is then derived by defining the new weightwt+1 as the solution to the following optimization problem:\nmin w\n1 2 ||w \u2212wt||2 s.t.: ` (w;xt, yt) = 0. (1)\nIntuitively, if wt suffers no loss from the new data, i.e., ` (wt;xt, yt) = 0, the algorithm passively assignswt+1 = wt; otherwise, it aggressively projects wt to the feasible zone of parameter vectors that attain zero loss. With provable bounds, (Crammer et al., 2006) shows that online PA algorithms could achieve comparable results to the optimal classifier w\u2217. In practice, in order to account for inseparable training samples, soft margin constraints are often\nadopted and the resulting learning problem is\nmin w\n1 2 ||w \u2212wt||2 + 2c` (w;xt, yt), (2)\nwhere c is a positive regularization parameter. For problems (1) and (2) with samples arriving one at a time, closedform solutions can be derived (Crammer et al., 2006)."}, {"heading": "2.2. Online BayesPA Learning", "text": "Instead of updating a point estimate of w, online Bayesian PA (BayesPA) sequentially infers a new posterior distribution qt+1(w), either parametric or nonparametric, on the arrival of new data (xt, yt) by solving the following optimization problem:\nmin q(w)\u2208Ft\nKL[q(w)||qt(w)]\u2212 Eq(w)[log p(xt|w)]\ns.t.: ` [q(w);xt, yt] = 0, (3)\nwhere Ft is some distribution family, e.g., the probability simplex P . In other words, we find a posterior distribution qt+1(w) in the feasible zone that is not only close to qt(w) by the commonly used KL-divergence, but also has a high likelihood of explaining new data. As a result, if Bayes\u2019 rule already gives the posterior distribution qt+1(w) \u221d qt(w)p(xt|w) that suffers no loss (i.e., ` = 0), BayesPA passively updates the posterior following just Bayes\u2019 rule; otherwise, BayesPA aggressively projects the new posterior to the feasible zone of posteriors that attain zero loss. We should note that when no likelihood is defined (e.g., p(xt|w) is independent of w), BayesPA will passively set qt+1(w) = qt(w) if qt(w) suffers no loss. We call it non-likelihood BayesPA.\nIn practical problems, the constraints in (3) could be unrealizable. To deal with such cases, we introduce the softmargin version of BayesPA learning, which is equivalent to minimizing the objective function L(q(w)) in problem (3) with a regularization term (Cortes & Vapnik, 1995):\nqt+1(w) = argmin q(w)\u2208Ft\nL(q(w)) + 2c` (q(w);xt, yt). (4)\nFor the max-margin classifiers that we focus on in this paper, two loss functions ` (q(w);xt, yt) are common \u2014 the hinge loss of an averaging classifier that makes predictions using the rule y\u0302t = sign Eq(w)[w>xt]:\n`Avg [q(w);xt, yt] = ( \u2212 ytEq(w)[w>xt])+\nand the expected hinge loss of a Gibbs classifier that randomly draws a classifier w \u223c q(w) to make predictions using the rule y\u0302t = sign w>xt:\n`Gibbs [q(w);xt, yt] = Eq(w)[( \u2212 ytw>xt)+].\nThey are closely connected via the following lemma due to the convexity of the function (x)+.\nLemma 2.1. The expected hinge loss `Gibbs is an upper bound of the hinge loss `Avg , that is, ` Gibbs \u2265 `Avg .\nBefore developing BayesPA learning for practical problems, we make several observations.\nLemma 2.2. If q0(w) = N (0, I), Ft = P and we use `Avg , the non-likelihood BayesPA subsumes the online PA.\nThis can be proved by induction. First, we can show that qt(w) = N (\u00b5t, I) is a normal distribution with an identity covariance matrix. Second, we can show that the posterior mean \u00b5t is updated in the same way as in the online PA. We defer the detailed proof to Appendix A.\nLemma 2.3. If Ft = P and we use `Gibbs , the update rule of online BayesPA is\nqt+1(w) = qt(w)p(xt|w)e\u22122c( \u2212ytw\n>xt)+\n\u0393(xt, yt) , (5)\nwhere \u0393(xt, yt) is the normalization constant.\nTherefore, the posterior qt(w) in the previous round t becomes a prior, while the newly observed data and its loss function provide a likelihood and an unnormalized pseudolikelihood respectively.\nMini-Batches. A useful technique to reduce the noise in data is the use of mini-batches. Suppose that we have a mini-batch of data points at time t with an index set Bt, denoted as Xt = {xd}d\u2208Bt ,Yt = {yd}d\u2208Bt . The Bayesian PA update equation for this mini-batch is simply,\nqt+1(w) = argmin q\u2208Ft\nL(q(w)) + 2c` (q(w);Xt,Yt),\nwhere ` (q(w);Xt,Yt) = \u2211 d\u2208Bt ` (q(w);xd, yd)."}, {"heading": "2.3. Learning with Latent Structures", "text": "To expressively explain complex real-word data, Bayesian models with latent structures have been extensively developed. The latent structures could typically be characterized by two kinds of latent variables \u2014 local latent variables hd (d \u2265 0) that characterize the hidden structures of each observed data xd and global variables M that capture the common properties shared by all data.\nThe goal of Bayesian PA learning with latent structures is therefore to update the distribution of M as well as weights w based on each incoming mini-batch (Xt,Yt) and their corresponding latent variables Ht = {hd}d\u2208Bt . Because of the uncertainty in Ht, we extend BayesPA to infer the joint posterior distribution, qt+1(w,M,Ht), as solving\nmin q\u2208Ft\nL(q(w,M,Ht)) + 2c` (q(w,M,Ht);Xt,Yt),(6)\nwhere L(q)=KL[q||qt(w,M)p0(Ht)]\u2212Eq[log p(Xt|w, M,Ht)] and ` (q;Xt,Yt) is some cumulative marginloss on the min-batch data induced from some classifiers defined on the latent variables Ht and/or global variables M. Both the averaging classifiers and Gibbs classifiers can be used as in the case without latent variables. We will present concrete examples in the next section.\nBefore diving into the details, we should note that in real online setting, only global variables are maintained in the bookkeeping, while the local information in the streaming data is forgotten. However, (6) gives us a distribution of (w,M) that is coupled with the local variables Ht. Although in some cases we can marginalize out the local variables Ht, in general we would not obtain a closed-form posterior distribution qt+1(w,M) for the next optimization round, especially in dealing with some involved models like MedLDA (Zhu et al., 2012). Therefore, we resort to approximation methods, e.g., by posing additional assumptions about q(w,M,Ht) such as the mean-field assumption, q(w,M,Ht) = q(w)q(M)q(Ht). Then, we can solve the problem via an iterative procedure and use the optimal distribution q\u2217(w)q\u2217(M) as qt+1(w,M). More details will be provided in next sections."}, {"heading": "3. Online Max-Margin Topic Models", "text": "We apply the theory of online BayesPA to topic modeling and develop online learning algorithms for max-margin topic models. We also present a nonparametric generalization to resolve the number of topics in the next section."}, {"heading": "3.1. Batch MedLDA", "text": "A max-margin topic model consists of a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) model for describing the underlying topic representations and a max-margin classifier for predicting responses. Specifically, LDA is a hierarchical Bayesian model that treats each document as an admixture of topics, \u03a6 = {\u03c6k}Kk=1, where each topic \u03c6k is a multinomial distribution over a W -word vocabulary. Let \u03b8 denote the mixing proportions. The generative process of document d is described as\n\u03b8d \u223c Dir(\u03b1), zdi \u223c Mult(\u03b8d), xdi \u223c Mult(\u03c6zdi), \u2200i \u2208 [nd]\nwhere zdi is a topic assignment variable and Mult(\u00b7) is a multinomial distribution. For Bayesian LDA, the topics are drawn from a Dirichlet distribution, i.e., \u03c6k \u223c Dir(\u03b3).\nGiven a document set X = {xd}Dd=1. Let Z = {zd}Dd=1 and \u0398 = {\u03b8d}Dd=1. LDA infers the posterior distribution p(\u03a6,\u0398,Z|X) \u221d p0(\u03a6,\u0398,Z)p(X|Z,\u03a6) via Bayes\u2019\nrule. From a variational point of view, the Bayes posterior is equivalent to the solution of the optimization problem:\nmin q\u2208P\nKL[q(\u03a6,\u0398,Z)||p(\u03a6,\u0398,Z|X)].\nThe advantage of the variational formulation of Bayesian inference lies in the convenience of posing restrictions on the post-data distribution with a regularization term. For supervised topic models (Blei & McAuliffe, 2010; Zhu et al., 2012), such a regularization term could be a loss function of a prediction model w on the data X = {xd}Dd=1 and response signals Y = {yd}Dd=1. As a regularized Bayesian (RegBayes) model (Jiang et al., 2012), MedLDA infers a distribution of the latent variables Z as well as classification weights w by solving the problem:\nmin q\u2208P L(q(w,\u03a6,\u0398,Z)) + 2c D\u2211 d=1 ` (q(w, zd);xd, yd),\nwhere L(q(w,\u03a6,\u0398,Z)) = KL[q(w,\u03a6,\u0398,Z)||p(w,\u03a6,\u0398, Z|X)] . To specify the loss function, a linear discriminant function needs to be defined with respect to w and zd\nf(w, zd) = w >z\u0304d, (7)\nwhere z\u0304dk = 1nd \u2211 i I[zdi = k] is the average topic assignments of the words in document d.

Online MedLDA", "text": "To apply the online BayesPA, we have the global variables M = \u03a6 and local variables Ht = (\u0398t,Zt). We consider Gibbs MedLDA because as shown in (Zhu et al., 2013a) it admits efficient inference algorithms by exploring data augmentation. Specifically, let \u03b6d = \u2212 ydf(w, zd) and \u03c8(yd|zd,w) = e\u22122c(\u03b6d)+ . Then in light of Lemma 2.3, the optimal solution to problem (6), qt+1(w,M,Ht), is\nqt(w,M)p0(Ht)p(Xt|Ht,M)\u03c8(Yt|Ht,w) \u0393(Xt,Yt) ,\nwhere \u03c8(Yt|Ht,w) = \u220f\nd\u2208Bt \u03c8(yd|hd,w) and \u0393(Xt,Yt) is a normalization constant. To potentially improve the inference accuracy, we first integrate out the local variables \u0398t by the conjugacy between a Dirichlet prior and a multinomial likelihood (Griffiths & Steyvers, 2004; Teh et al., 2006b). Then we have the local variables Ht = Zt.

In fact, the augmented distribution qt+1(w,\u03a6,Zt,\u03bbt) is the solution to the problem:\nmin q\u2208P L(q(w,\u03a6,Zt,\u03bbt))\u2212 Eq[log\u03c8(Yt,\u03bbt|Zt,w)], (11)\nwhere L(q) = KL[q(w,\u03a6,Zt,\u03bbt)\u2016qt(w,\u03a6)p0(Zt)]\u2212 Eq[log p(Xt|Zt,\u03a6)]. We can show that this objective is an upper bound of that in the original problem (6). See Appendix B for details.\nWith the mild mean-field assumption that q(w,\u03a6,Zt,\u03bbt) = q(w)q(\u03a6)q(Zt,\u03bbt), we can solve (11) via an iterative procedure that alternately updates each factor distribution (Jordan et al., 1998), as detailed below.\nGlobal Update: By fixing the distribution of local variables, q(Zt,\u03bbt), and ignoring irrelevant variables, we have the mean-field update equations:\nq(\u03a6k) \u221d qt(\u03a6k) exp(Eq(Zt)[log p0(Zt)p(X|Zt,\u03a6)]), \u2200 k q(w) \u221d qt(w) exp(Eq(Zt,\u03bbt)[log p0(Zt)\u03c8(Yt,\u03bbt|Zt,w)]).\nIf initially q0(\u03a6k) = Dir(\u22060k1, ...,\u2206 0 kW ) and q0(w) = N (w;\u00b50,\u03a30), by induction we can show that the inferred distributions in each round has a closed form, namely, qt(\u03a6k) = Dir(\u2206tk1, ...,\u2206 t kW ) and qt(w) = N (w;\u00b5t,\u03a3t). For the above update equations, we have\nq(\u03a6k) = Dir(\u2206\u2217k1, ...,\u2206 \u2217 kW ), (12)\nwhere \u2206\u2217kw = \u2206 t kw + \u2211 d\u2208Bt \u2211 i\u2208[nd] \u03b3 k di \u00b7 I[xdi = w] for all words w and \u03b3kdi = Eq(zd)I[zdi = k] is the probability of assigning word xdi to topic k, and\nq(w) = N (w;\u00b5\u2217,\u03a3\u2217), (13)\nwhere the posterior paramters are computed as (\u03a3\u2217)\u22121 = (\u03a3t)\u22121 + c2 \u2211 d\u2208Bt Eq(zd,\u03bbd)[\u03bb \u22121 d z\u0304dz\u0304 > d ] and \u00b5 \u2217 =\n\u03a3\u2217(\u03a3t)\u22121\u00b5t + \u03a3\u2217 \u00b7 c \u2211 d\u2208Bt Eq(zd,\u03bbd)[yd(1 + c \u03bb \u22121 d )z\u0304d].\nLocal Update: Given the distribution of global variables, q(\u03a6,w), the mean-field update equation for (Zt,\u03bbt) is\nq(Zt,\u03bbt) \u221d p0(Zt) \u220f d\u2208Bt 1\u221a 2\u03c0\u03bbd exp ( \u2211 i\u2208[nd] \u039bzdi,xdi\n\u2212Eq(\u03a6,w)[ (\u03bbd + c\u03b6d)\n2 2\u03bbd ] ) , (14)\nAlgorithm 1 Online MedLDA 1: Let q0(w) = N (0; v2I), q0(\u03c6k) = Dir(\u03b3), \u2200 k. 2: for t = 0\u2192\u221e do 3: Set q(\u03a6,w) = qt(\u03a6,w).

But it is impossible to evaluate the expectation in the global update using (14) because of the huge number of configurations for (Zt,\u03bbt). As a result, we turn to Gibbs sampling and estimate the required expectations using multiple empirical samples. This hybrid strategy has shown promising performance for LDA (Mimno et al., 2012). Specifically, the conditional distributions used in the Gibbs sampling are as follows:\nFor Zt: By canceling out common factors, the conditional distribution of one variable zdi given Z\u00acdit and \u03bbt is\nq(zdi=k|Z\u00acdit ,\u03bbt)\u221d(\u03b1+C\u00acdidk )exp ( cyd(c +\u03bbd)\u00b5 \u2217 k\nnd\u03bbd\n+\u039bk,xdi \u2212 c2(\u00b5\u22172k +\u03a3 \u2217 kk+2(\u00b5 \u2217 k\u00b5 \u2217+\u03a3\u2217\u00b7,k) >C\u00acdid )\n2n2d\u03bbd\n) , (15)\nwhere \u03a3\u2217\u00b7,k is the k-th column of \u03a3 \u2217,C\u00acdid is a vector with the k-th entry being the number of words in document d (except the i-th word) that are assigned to topic k.\nFor \u03bbt: Let \u03b6\u0304d = \u2212ydz\u0304>d \u00b5\u2217.

To make predictions on testing data, we then draw one sample of w\u0302 as the classification weight and apply the prediction rule. The inference of z\u0304 for testing documents is the same as in (Zhu et al., 2013a)."}, {"heading": "4.

The generative process of HDP can be summarized using a stick-breaking construction (Wang & Blei, 2012), where the stick lengths \u03c0 = {\u03c0k}\u221ek=1 are generated as:\n\u03c0k = \u03c0\u0304k \u220f i<k (1\u2212 \u03c0\u0304i), \u03c0\u0304k \u223c Beta(1, \u03b3), for k = 1, ...,\u221e,\nand the topic mixing proportions are generated as \u03b8d \u223c Dir(\u03b1\u03c0), for d = 1, ..., D. Each topic \u03c6k is a sample from a Dirichlet base distribution, i.e., \u03c6k \u223c Dir(\u03b7). After we get the topic mixing proportions \u03b8d, the generation of words is the same as in the standard LDA.\nTo augment the HDP topic model for predictive tasks, we introduce a classifier w and define the linear discriminant function in the same form as (7), where we should note that since the number of words in a document is finite, the average topic assignment vector z\u0304d has only a finite number of non-zero elements. Therefore, the dot product in (7) is in fact finite. Let \u03c0\u0304 = {\u03c0\u0304k}\u221ek=1. We define MedHDP as solving the following problem to infer the joint posterior q(w, \u03c0\u0304,\u03a6,\u0398,Z)1:\nmin q\u2208P L(q(w, \u03c0\u0304,\u03a6,\u0398,Z)) + 2c D\u2211 d=1 ` (q(w, zd);xd,yd),\nwhere L(q(w,\u03a6, \u03c0\u0304,\u0398,Z)) = KL[q(w,\u03a6, \u03c0\u0304,\u0398,Z)||p(w, \u03c0\u0304,\u03a6,\u0398,Z|X)], and the loss function could be either (8) or (9), leading to the MedHDP topic models with either averaging or Gibbs classifiers."}, {"heading": "4.2. Online MedHDP", "text": "To apply the online BayesPA, we have the global variables M = (\u03c0\u0304,\u03a6), and the local variables Ht = (\u0398t,Zt). We again focus on the expected hinge loss (9) in this paper. As in online MedLDA, we marginalize out \u0398t and adopt the same data augmentation technique with the augmented variables \u03bbt. Furthermore, to simplify the sampling scheme, we introduce auxiliary latent variables St = {sd}d\u2208Bt , where sdk represents the number of occupied tables serving dish k in a Chinese Restaurant Process (Teh et al., 2006a; Wang & Blei, 2012). By definition, we have p(Zt,St|\u03c0\u0304) = \u220f d\u2208Bt p(sd, zd|\u03c0\u0304) and\np(sd, zd|\u03c0\u0304) \u221d \u221e\u220f k=1 S(ndz\u0304dk, sdk)(\u03b1\u03c0k) sdk , (17)\n1Given \u03c0\u0304, \u03c0 can be computed via the stick breaking process.\nwhere S(a, b) are unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind (Antoniak, 1974). It is not hard to verify that p(zd|\u03c0\u0304) = \u2211 sd p(sd, zd|\u03c0\u0304). Therefore, we have local variables Ht = (Zt,St,\u03bbt), and the target collapsed posterior qt+1(w, \u03c0\u0304,\u03a6,Zt,\u03bbt) is the marginal distribution of qt+1(w, \u03c0\u0304,\u03a6,Ht), which is the solution of the problem:\nmin q\u2208Ft\nL(q(w, \u03c0\u0304,\u03a6,Ht))\u2212Eq[log\u03c8(Yt,\u03bbt|Zt,w)], (18)\nwhere L(q) = KL[q||qt(w, \u03c0\u0304,\u03a6)p(Zt,St|\u03c0\u0304)p(Xt|Zt,\u03a6)] . As in online MedLDA, we solve (18) via an iterative procedure detailed below.\nGlobal Update: By fixing the distribution of local variables, q(Zt,St,\u03bbt), and ignoring the irrelevant terms, we have the mean-field update equations for \u03a6 and w, the same as in (12) and (13), while for \u03c0\u0304, we have\nq(\u03c0\u0304k) \u221d qt(\u03c0\u0304k) \u220f d\u2208Bt exp(Eq(hd)[log p(sd, zd|\u03c0\u0304)]). (19)\nBy induction, we can show that qt(\u03c0\u0304k) = Beta(utk, v t k), a Beta distribution at each step, and the update equation is\nq(\u03c0\u0304k) = Beta(u\u2217k, v \u2217 k), (20)\nwhere u\u2217k = u t k + \u2211 d\u2208Bt Eq(sd)[sdk] and v \u2217 k = v t k +\u2211\nd\u2208Bt Eq(sd)[ \u2211 j>k sdj ] for k = {1, 2, ...}. SinceZt contains only finite number of discrete variables, we only need to maintain and update the global distribution for a finite number of topics.\nLocal Update: Fixing the global distribution q(w, \u03c0\u0304,\u03a6), we get the mean-field update equation for (Zt,St,\u03bbt):\nq(Zt,St,\u03bbt) \u221d q\u0303(Zt,St)q\u0303(Zt,\u03bbt) (21)\nwhere q\u0303(Zt,St) = exp(Eq(\u03a6)q(\u03c0\u0304)[log p(Xt|\u03a6,Zt) + log p(Zt,St|\u03c0\u0304)]) and q\u0303(Zt,\u03bbt) = exp(Eq(w)[log\u03c8(Yt, \u03bbt|w,Zt)]). To overcome the the potentially unbounded latent space, we take the ideas from (Wang & Blei, 2012) and adopt an approximation for q\u0303(Zt,St):\nq\u0303(Zt,St) \u2248 Eq(\u03a6)q(\u03c0\u0304)[p(X|\u03a6,Zt)p(Zt,St|\u03c0\u0304)]. (22)\nInstead of marginalizing out \u03c0\u0304 in (22), which is analytically difficult, we sample \u03c0\u0304 jointly with (Zt,St,\u03bbt). This leads to the following Gibbs sampling scheme:\nFor Zt: Let K be the current inferred number of topics. The conditional distribution of one variable zdi givenZ\u00acdit , \u03bbt and \u03c0\u0304 can be derived from (21) with sd marginalized out for convenience:\nq(zdi = k|Z\u00acdit ,\u03bbt, \u03c0\u0304) \u221d (\u03b1\u03c0k+C\n\u00acdi dk )(C \u00acdi kxdi +\u2206\u2217kxdi )\u2211\nw (C \u00acdi kw +\u2206 \u2217 kw) exp ( cyd(c +\u03bbd)\u00b5 \u2217 k\nnd\u03bbd \u2212 c\n2(\u00b5\u22172k +\u03a3 \u2217 kk+2(\u00b5 \u2217 k\u00b5 \u2217+\u03a3\u2217\u00b7,k) >C\u00acdid )\n2n2d\u03bbd\n) .\nBesides, for k > K and symmetric Dirichlet prior \u03b7, this becomes q(zdi = k|Z\u00acdit ,\u03bbt, \u03c0\u0304) \u221d \u03b1\u03c0k/W , and therefore the total probability of assigning a new topic is\nq(zdi > K|Z\u00acdit ,\u03bbt, \u03c0\u0304) \u221d \u03b1\n( 1\u2212\nK\u2211 k=1 \u03c0k\n) /W.\nFor \u03bbt: The conditional distribution q(\u03bbd|Zt,St, \u03c0\u0304) is the same as (16).\nFor St: The conditional distribution of sdk given Zt, \u03c0\u0304, \u03bbt can be derived from the joint distribution (17):\nq(sdk|Zt,\u03bbt, \u03c0\u0304) \u221d S(ndz\u0304dk, sdk)(\u03b1\u03c0k)sdk (23)\nFor \u03c0\u0304: It can be derived from (21) that given (Zt,St,\u03bbt), each \u03c0\u0304k follows the beta distribution, \u03c0\u0304k \u223c Beta(ak, bk), where ak = u\u2217k + \u2211 d\u2208Bt sdk and bk = v \u2217 k +\u2211\nd\u2208Bt \u2211 j>k sdj .\nSimilar to online MedLDA, we iterate the above steps till convergence for training."}, {"heading": "5.

A sensitivity analysis of the key parameters is also provided. Following the same setting in (Zhu et al., 2012), we remove a standard list of stop words. All of the experiments are done on a normal computer with single-core clock rate up to 2.4 GHz."}, {"heading": "5.1. Classification on 20Newsgroup", "text": "We perform multi-class classification on the entire 20NG dataset with all the 20 categories. The training set contains 11,269 documents, with the smallest category having 376 documents and the biggest category having 599 documents. The test set contains 7,505 documents, with the smallest and biggest categories having 259 and 399 documents respectively. We adopt the \u201done-vs-all\u201d strategy (Rifkin & Klautau, 2004) to combine binary classifiers for multi-class prediction tasks.\nWe compare paMedLDA and paMedHDP with their batch counterparts, denoted as bMedLDA and bMedHDP, which are obtained by letting the batch size |B| be equal to the dataset sizeD, and Gibbs MedLDA, denoted as gMedLDA, (Zhu et al., 2013a), which performs Gibbs sampling in the batch manner. We also consider online unsupervised topic models as baselines, including sparse inference for LDA (spLDA) (Mimno et al., 2012), which has been demonstrated to be superior than online variational LDA (Hoffman et al., 2010) in performance, and truncation-free online variational HDP (tfHDP) (Wang & Blei, 2012), which\nhas been shown to be promising in nonparametric topic modeling. For both of them, we learn a linear SVM with the topic representations using LIBSVM (Chang & Lin, 2011). The performances of other batch supervised topic models, such as sLDA (Blei & McAuliffe, 2010) and DiscLDA (Lacoste-Julien et al., 2008), are reported in (Zhu et al., 2012). For all LDA-based topic models, we use symmetric Dirichlet priors \u03b1 = 1/K \u00b7 1,\u03b3 = 0.5 \u00b7 1; for all HDP-based topic models, we use \u03b1 = 5, \u03b3 = 1,\u03b7 = 0.45 \u00b7 1; for all MED topic models, we use = 164, c = 1, v = 1, the choice of which is not crucial to the models\u2019 performance as shown in (Zhu et al., 2013a).\nWe first analyze how many processed documents are sufficient for each model to converge. Figure 1 shows the prediction accuracy with the number of passes through the entire 20NG dataset, where K = 80 for parametric models and (I,J , \u03b2) = (1, 2, 0) for BayesPA. As we could observe, by solving a series of latent BayesPA learning problems, paMedLDA and paMedHDP fully explore the redundancy of documents and converge in one pass, while their batch counterparts need many passes as burn-in steps. Besides, compared with the online unsupervised learning algorithms, BayesPA topic models utilize supervising-side information from each mini-batch, and therefore exhibit a faster convergence rate in discrimination ability.\nNext, we study each model\u2019s best performance possible and the corresponding training time. To allow for a fair comparison, we train each model until the relative change of its objective is less than 10\u22124. Figure 2 shows the accuracy and training time of LDA-based models on the whole dataset with varying numbers of topics. Similarly, Figure 3 shows the accuracy and training time of HDP-based models, where the dots stand for the mean inferred numbers of topics, and the lengths of the horizontal bars represent their standard deviations. As we can see, BayesPA topic models, at the power of online learning, are about 1 order of magnitude faster than their batch counterparts in training time. Furthermore, thanks to the merits of Gibbs sampling, which does not pose strict mean-field assumptions about the independence of latent variables, BayesPA topic mod-\nels parallel their batch alternatives in accuracy."}, {"heading": "5.2. Further Discussions", "text": "We provide further discussions on BayesPA learning for topic models. First, we analyze the models\u2019 sensitivity to some key parameters.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS", "text": "Batch Size |B|: Figure 4 presents the test errors of BayesPA topic models as a function of training time on the entire 20NG dataset with various batch sizes, where K = 40. We can see that the convergence speeds of different algorithms vary. First of all, the batch algorithms suffer from multiple passes through the dataset and therefore are much slower than the online alternatives. Second, we could observe that algorithms with medium batch sizes (|B| = 64, 256) converge faster. If we choose a batch size too small, for example, |B| = 1, each iteration would not provide sufficient evidence for the update of global variables; if the batch size is too large, each mini-batch becomes redundant and the convergence rate reduces.\nNumber of iterations I and samples J : Since the time complexity of Algorithm 1 is linear in both I and J , we would like to know how these parameters influence the\nquality of the trained model. First, notice that the first \u03b2 samples are discarded as burn-in steps. To understand how large \u03b2 is sufficient, we consider the settings of the pairs (J , \u03b2) and check the prediction accuracy of Algorithm 1 for K = 40, |B| = 512, as shown in Table 1.\nWe can see that accuracies closer to the diagonal of the table are relatively lower, while settings with the same number of kept samples, e.g. (J , \u03b2) = (3, 0), (5, 2), (9, 6), yield similar results. The number of kept samples exhibits a more significant role in the performance of BayesPA topic models than the burn-in steps.\nNext, we analyze which setting of (I,J ) guarantees good performance. Figure 5 presents the results. As we can see, for J = 1, the algorithms suffer from the noisy approximation and therefore sacrifices prediction accuracy. But for larger J , simply I = 1 is promising, possibly due to the redundancy among mini-batches."}, {"heading": "5.2.2.

The Wiki dataset is a collection of documents with labels up to 20 different kinds, while the data distribution among the labels is balanced. The training/testing split is 1.1 million / 5 thousand. To measure performance, we use F1 score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\nFigure 6 shows the F1 scores of various models as a function of training time. We can see that BayesPA topic models are again about 1 order of magnitude faster than the batch alternatives and yet produce comparable results.

Based on the ideas of BayesPA, we develop efficient online learning algorithms for max-margin topic models as well as their nonparametric extensions. Empirical experiments on several real datasets demonstrate significant improvements on time efficiency, while maintaining comparable results.\nAs future work, we are interested in showing provable bounds in its convergence and limitations. Furthermore, better understanding its mathematical structure would allow one to design more involved BayesPA algorithms for various models. We are also interested in developing highly scalable, distributed (Broderick et al., 2013) BayesPA learning paradigms, which will better meet the demand of processing massive real data available today."}, {"heading": "Appendix A: Proof of Lemma 2.2", "text": "In this section, we prove Lemma 2.2. We should note that our deviations below also provide insights for the developments of online BayesPA algorithms with the averaging classifiers.\nProof. We prove for the more generalized soft-margin version of BayesPA learning, which can be reformulated using a slack variable \u03be:\nqt+1(w) = argmin q(w)\u2208P\nKL[q(w)||qt(w)] + c\u03be\ns.t. : ytEq[w>xt] \u2265 \u2212 \u03be, \u03be \u2265 0. (24)\nSimilar to Corollary 5 in (Zhu et al., 2012), the optimal solution q\u2217(w) of the above problem can be derived from its functional Lagrangian and has the following form:\nq\u2217(w) = 1\n\u0393(\u03c4) qt(w) exp(\u03c4ytw\n>xt) (25)\nwhere \u0393(\u03c4) is a normalization term and \u03c4 is the optimal solution to the dual problem:\nmax \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2212 log \u0393(\u03c4) s.t. 0 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 c\n(26)\nUsing this primal-dual interpretation, we first prove that for prior p0(w) = N (w0, I), qt(w) = N (\u00b5t, I) for some \u00b5t in each round t = 0, 1, 2, .... This can be shown by induction. Assume for round t, the distribution qt(w) = N (\u00b5t, I). Then for round t+ 1, the distribution by (25) is\nqt+1(w) = 1\nC \u00b7 \u0393(\u03c4) exp\n( \u2212 1\n2 ||w \u2212 (\u00b5t + \u03c4ytxt)||2 ) (27)\nwhere C is some constant.
