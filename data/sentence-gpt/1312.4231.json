Rough sets provide a theoretical foundation for the issue. Matroids generalized from matrices have been widely used in many fields, particularly greedy algorithm design, which plays an important role in attribute reduction. The problem is that if you use matrices as well as matrices as the data mining system you should understand that matrices are really only very useful for performing computations, since matrices are really not as easy to do as are matrices.\n\nIn matrices are usually called matrix. They are used as a kind of memory storage, and the storage in the system depends on the data mining system. In reality, they are used as memory storage (or storage for data mining). They can also be used as a memory storage in an efficient manner, because of their efficiency.\nMatrices are generally used in a very large number of cases, so they are always handy for performance purposes. Because of their efficient performance, matrices can be used to store a lot of data (the result of a data mining process is a good representation of data mining).\nThere are several solutions to the problem, but in many cases they are a good first choice for performance purposes, because they give a better solution to the problem. However, some of these solutions are quite complex, like the Matrices.\nHere is an example. When you look at data mining, it is often hard to see any real data mining algorithms that are very difficult to understand. This is because matrices are basically in the same block number as matrices, because they are not quite the same as matrices. However, the matrices have very specific memory structures, and they can only be considered as memory storage.\nTo achieve this, matrices are used for storing all data and storing data in storage. If you have a very small memory structure, you can easily store all the data and the data at a different time. This means that you can easily have lots of data at a different time.\nAs you see in this example, the number of values in memory, and the number of bytes used to store them, is much smaller than matrices. This is what the Matrices are called.\nIn matrices we have some interesting things about the computation. They can be used to store the data, and the number of bytes that can be stored. The number of bytes is not very small, since it is an exact result of a data mining process.\nAs a result of these problems", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Dec 2013 02:27:15 GMT  (21kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4231v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 5 Mar 2015 02:45:33 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4231v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["aiping huang", "william zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.4231"}, "pdf": {"name": "1312.4231.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Aiping Huanga", "William Zhub"], "emails": ["williamfengzhu@gmail.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar X\niv :1\n31 2.\n42 31\nv2 [\ncs .A\nI] 5\nM ar\nAttribute reduction is a basic issue in knowledge representation and data mining. Rough sets provide a theoretical foundation for the issue. Matroids generalized from matrices have been widely used in many fields, particularly greedy algorithm design, which plays an important role in attribute reduction. Therefore, it is meaningful to combine matroids with rough sets to solve the optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce an existing algebraic structure called dependence space to study the reduction problem in terms of matroids. First, a dependence space of matroids is constructed. Second, the characterizations for the space such as consistent sets and reducts are studied through matroids. Finally, we investigate matroids by the means of the space and present two expressions for their bases. In a word, this paper provides new approaches to study attribute reduction.\nKeywords: Rough set, Matroid, Dependence space"}, {"heading": "1. Introduction", "text": "In many applications, information and knowledge are stored and represented in an information table, where an object is described by a set of attributes. It is nature for us to fact such a problem that for a special property whether all the attributes in the attribute set are always necessary to preserve this property or not, because using entire attribute set to describe the property is time consuming, and obtained rules may be difficult to understand, to apply and to verify. In order to solve these problems, attribute reduction is required [2, 11, 12, 22]. Rough sets proposed by Pawlak [16] may be the most recent one marking significant contributions to deal with the issues of knowledge reduction in the sense of reducing attributes. It can describe knowledge via set-theoretic analysis based on equivalence classification for the universe set. On one hand, in order to solve practical problems preferably through rough sets, its axiom systems have been built [5, 9, 10] and generalization works have been done [24, 25, 26].\n\u2217Corresponding author. Email address: williamfengzhu@gmail.com (William Zhu)\nOn the other hand, as is known, many optimization issues related to rough sets, including attribute reduction, are NP-hard, and thus, typically require greedy algorithms. To find effective methods for solving these problems, rough sets have been combined with other theories [1, 3, 19, 20], especially matroid theory [6, 8, 17, 18, 21, 27], which borrows extensively from linear algebra and graph theory. With abundant theories and a perfect system, matroid theory has been widely used in many fields including combinatorial optimization, network flows [7], and algorithm design, especially greedy algorithm design [4]. Therefore, studying rough sets in conjunction with matroids may help solve some optimization issues. A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.\nIn many problems, a greedy strategy does not in general produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable time. The most wonderful thing is that the question whether a greedy algorithm produces an optimal solution for a particular problem can be converted to the question whether there exists a translation of the problem into a matroid. Furthermore, the optimal solutions are bases of the matroid. There are two well-known optimization problems solved by greedy algorithms designed by matroids. One is the minimum-weight spanning tree problem, the other is job assignment problem. The solution for the former problem is a base of the corresponding graphic matroid, and the solution for the latter one is a base of the corresponding transversal matroid. This prompts us to establish relationships between the bases of a matroid and the attribute reduction.\nIn this paper, we construct a dependence space in the context of matroids and apply it to attribute reduction problems. First, a dependence space of matroids is proposed from the viewpoint of closure operator. Second, we study the dependence space by means of matroids. It is interesting to find that the set of consistent sets and the set of reducts of the dependence space are the family of independent sets and the family of bases of the corresponding matroid, respectively. Finally, matroids are studied conversely by dependence spaces and two expressions for bases of matroids are presented. Therefore, this work provides new viewpoints for studying the issues of attribute reduction.\nThe rest of this paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 reviews some fundamental concepts related to rough sets, information systems, and matroids. In Section 3, we propose a dependence space of matroids. Section 4 studies the dependence space in terms of matroids. The dependence spaces are studied matroids in Section 5, while Section 6 concludes this paper."}, {"heading": "2. Preliminaries", "text": "To facilitate our discussion, some fundamental concepts related to rough sets and matroids are reviewed in this section.\n2.1. Rough sets Rough sets, based on equivalence relations, provide a systematic approach to data preprocessing in data mining. The lower and upper approximation operations, which\nare two key concepts in the theory, are used to describe objects.\nDefinition 1. (Approximation operators [16]) Let U be a finite set, R be an equivalence relation of U , and X \u2286 U . Then the lower and upper approximations of X , denoted by R\u2217(X) and R\u2217(X), respectively, are defined as:\nR\u2217(X) = {x \u2208 U : \u2200 y \u2208 U, xRy \u21d2 y \u2208 X} = {x \u2208 U : [x]R \u2286 X}, R\u2217(X) = {x \u2208 U : \u2203 y \u2208 U s.t. xRy} = {x \u2208 U : [x]R \u22c2 X 6= \u2205},\nwhere [x]R = {y \u2208 U : xRy} denotes the equivalence class of x with respect to relation R.\n2.2. Matroids Matroid theory borrows extensively from the terminology of linear algebra and graph theory, largely because it is an abstraction of various notions of central importance in these fields, such as independent sets, bases, and rank functions. One of the most valuable definitions of matroids is presented in terms of independent sets.\nDefinition 2. (Matroid [15]) A matroid M is an ordered pair (U, I) consisting of a finite set U and a collection I of subsets of U satisfying the following three conditions: (I1) \u2205 \u2208 I. (I2) If I \u2208 I and I \u2032 \u2286 I , then I \u2032\n\u2208 I. (I3) If I1, I2 \u2208 I and |I1| < |I2|, then there is an element e \u2208 I2 \u2212 I1 such that I1 \u22c3 {e} \u2208 I, where |X | denotes the cardinality of X .\nThe members of I are the independent sets of M and U is the ground set of M . We often write I(M) for I, particularly when several matroids are being considered. The bases and rank function of a matroid are defined based on independent sets. To describe these concepts intuitively, certain denotations are presented.\nDefinition 3. [15] Let A be a family of subsets of U . Then we denote Max(A) = {X \u2208 A : \u2200 Y \u2208 A, if X \u2286 Y, then X = Y }, Min(A) = {X \u2208 A : \u2200 Y \u2208 A, if Y \u2286 X, then X = Y }.\nFirst, the bases of a matroid, generalized from the maximal linearly independent group in vector space, are defined as follows.\nDefinition 4. (Base [15]) Let M = (U, I) be a matroid. Then a subset of U is said to be a base of M if it is maximal in the sense that it is not contained in any other element of I. If we denote the collection of bases of M by B(M), B(M) = Max(I).\nThe rank function rM : 2U \u2192 N of a matroid, which is a generalization of the rank of a matrix, is defined as rM (X) = max{|I| : I \u2286 X, I \u2208 I} (X \u2286 U ). The value rM (X) is called the rank of X in M . Based on the rank function, the closure operator clM : 2U \u2192 2U of a matroid is defined as clM (X) = {x \u2208 U : rM (X) = rM (X \u22c3\n{x})} (X \u2286 U ). If clM (X) = X , then X is called a closed set of matroid M . If X is a closed set and rM (X) = rM (U) \u2212 1, then X is called a hyperplane of matroid M and the set of all hyperplanes of M is denoted by H(M). It is clear that the ground set of M is a closed set of M . The following proposition defines a matroid in terms of closure operators.\nProposition 1. (Closure axiom [15]) Let U be a set. Then the function cl : 2U \u2192 2U is the closure operator of a matroid if and only if cl satisfies the following conditions: (CL1) : If X \u2286 U , then X \u2286 cl(X). (CL2) : If X \u2286 Y \u2286 U , then cl(X) \u2286 cl(Y ). (CL3) : If X \u2286 U , then cl(cl(X)) = cl(X). (CL4) : If X \u2286 U , x \u2208 U and y \u2208 cl(X \u22c3 {x})\u2212 cl(X), then x \u2208 cl(X \u22c3 {y}).\nSimilar to the operation from a vector space to its subspace, the restriction matroid is defined.\nDefinition 5. (Restriction matroid [15]) Let M = (U, I) be a matroid. Then for any X \u2286 U , the order pair (X, I|X) is a matroid, where I|X = {I \u2286 X : I \u2208 I}. This is called a restriction of M to X and is denoted by M |X ."}, {"heading": "3. Dependence space induced by matroids", "text": "The information about the objects of an information system yielded by different sets of attributes may depend on each other in various ways. For example, it may turn out that a proper subset of a set of attributes classifies the objects with the same accuracy as the original sets. Dependence spaces were introduced by Novotny\u0301 and Pawlak [13] as a general abstract setting for studying such informational dependency. Matroids provide well-established platforms for greedy algorithms, and just for this reason, matroids arise naturally in a number of problems in combinatorial optimization. In order to give play to the two theories\u2019 respective advantages in attribute reduction, this section constructs a dependence space by matroids firstly. At the beginning of this section, the concept of dependence space is presented.\nDefinition 6. (Dependence space [13]) Let U be a nonempty set and \u0398 an equivalence relation of 2U . For all B1, B2, C1, C2 \u2208 2U ,\n(B1, C1) \u2208 \u0398, (B2, C2) \u2208 \u0398 \u21d2 (B1 \u22c3 B2, C1 \u22c3 C2) \u2208 \u0398.\nThen \u0398 is referred to as a congruence relation of 2U and the pair (U,\u0398) is called a dependence space.\nThe dependence space in compliance with the above definition is a pair containing a nonempty set and a congruence relation. In other words, through constructing a congruence relation, one can obtain a dependence space.\nDefinition 7. Let M be a matroid of U . Then one can define a relation of 2U as follows: For all X,Y \u2208 2U ,\n(X,Y ) \u2208 \u0398M \u21d4 clM (X) = clM (Y ).\nIt is clear that the relation is an equivalence relation.\nExample 1. Let M = (U, I) be a matroid, where U = {1, 2, 3} and I = {\u2205, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}}. Then utilizing the definition of closure, we have clM (\u2205) = \u2205, clM ({2}) = {2}, clM ({1}) = clM ({3}) = clM ({1, 3}) = {1, 3} and clM ({1, 2}) = clM ({2, 3}) = clM (U) = U . Thus, \u0398M = {(\u2205, \u2205), ({1}, {1}), ({1}, {3}), ({3}, {1}), ({1}, {1, 3}), ({{3}, {3}), ({3}, {1, 3}), ({1, 3}, {1}), ({1, 3}, {1, 3}), ({1, 3}, {3}), ({2}, {2}), ({1, 2}, {1, 2}), ({1, 2}, {2, 3}), ({1, 2}, U), ({2, 3}, {1, 2}), ({2, 3}, {2, 3}), ({2, 3}, U), (U, {1, 2}), (U, {2, 3}), (U,U)}.\nIn order to verify whether the relation is a congruence relation or not, we study certain properties of closed sets in matroids first.\nLemma 1. [15] Let X be a closed set of a matroid M which ground set is U and suppose that rM (X) = rM (U)\u2212k where k \u2265 1. Then M has a set {H1, H2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Hk} of hyperplanes such that X = \u22c2 k\ni=1 Hi.\nBased on the result, we find that any closed set whose rank is less than that of ground set can be expressed by the intersection of some hyperplanes containing the set.\nCorollary 1. Let X be a closed set of a matroid M which ground set is U and suppose that rM (X) < rM (U). Then X = \u22c2 {H \u2208 H(M) : X \u2286 H}.\nPROOF. It is obvious that X \u2286 \u22c2\n{H \u2208 H(M) : X \u2286 H}. Let us assume that X = \u22c2k\ni=1 Hi, utilizing Lemma 1, we have {Hi \u2208 H(M) : i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , k} \u2286 {H \u2208\nH(M) : X \u2286 H}, thus X \u2286 \u22c2 {H \u2208 H(M) : X \u2286 H} \u2286 \u22c2 k\ni=1 Hi = X . Therefore,\nX = \u22c2 {H \u2208 H(M) : X \u2286 H}.\nIn fact, the result can be generalized to the closure of any subset. In other words, the closures of subsets can be characterized by hyperplanes.\nProposition 2. Let M be a matroid of U . Then for all X \u2286 U ,\nclM (X) =\n{\nU rM (X) = rM (U), \u22c2\n{H \u2208 H(M) : X \u2286 H} rM (X) 6= rM (U). (1)\nPROOF. First, we prove clM (X) = U when rM (X) = rM (U). For all x \u2208 U , rM (X) \u2264 rM (X \u22c3 {x}) \u2264 rM (U) = rM (X) which implies rM (X) = rM (X \u22c3\n{x}), i.e., x \u2208 clM (X). Hence U \u2286 clM (X). Combining with clM (X) \u2286 U , we have proved the result. For all X \u2286 U , rM (clM (X)) = rM (X) \u2264 rM (U). Then rM (X) 6= rM (U) implies rM (clM (X)) < rM (U). Utilizing Corollary 1, we know {H \u2208 H(M) : clM (X) \u2286 H} 6= \u2205. It is clear that {H \u2208 H(M) : clM (X) \u2286 H} \u2286 {H \u2208 H(M) : X \u2286 H} because X \u2286 clM (X). For all H \u2208 {H \u2208 H(M) : X \u2286 H}, clM (X) \u2286 clM (H) = H . Thus {H \u2208 H(M) : X \u2286 H} \u2286 {H \u2208 H(M) : clM (X) \u2286 H}. Therefore, {H \u2208 H(M) : X \u2286 H} = {H \u2208 H(M) : clM (X) \u2286 H}, i.e., clM (X) = \u22c2 {H \u2208 H(M) : clM (X) \u2286 H} = \u22c2 {H \u2208 H(M) : X \u2286 H}.\nTherefore, the properties of the closures of subsets can be equivalently described by hyperplanes.\nProposition 3. Let M be a matroid of U and X,Y \u2286 U . Then clM (X) \u2286 clM (Y ) \u21d4 \u2200H \u2208 H(M)(Y \u2286 H \u2192 X \u2286 H).\nPROOF. (\u201c\u21d2\u201d): If clM (Y ) = U , then for all H \u2208 H(M), Y * H . Thus we have the result. If clM (Y ) 6= U , then {H \u2208 H(M) : Y \u2286 H} 6= \u2205. Since Y \u2286 H , X \u2286 clM (X) \u2286 clM (Y ) \u2286 clM (H) = H . (\u201c\u21d0\u201d): If for all H \u2208 H(M), Y * H , then clM (Y ) = U . Otherwise, rM (Y ) 6= rM (U) holds. Utilizing Proposition 2, there exists H \u2208 H(M) such that Y \u2286 H , which implies a contradiction. Thus clM (X) \u2286 U = clM (Y ). For all H \u2208 H(M), if Y \u2286 H , then by assumption we have {H \u2208 H(M) : Y \u2286 H} \u2286 {H \u2208 H(M) : X \u2286 H}, which implies that clM (X) \u2286 clM (Y ).\nBased on the result, we find that the equivalence relation defined by Definition 7 is a congruence relation. Therefore, a dependence space of matroids is constructed.\nTheorem 1. Let M be a matroid of U . Then (U,\u0398M ) is a dependence space.\nPROOF. Let us assume that A1, A2, B1, B2 \u2286 U satisfy (A1, A2) \u2208 \u0398M and (B1, B2) \u2208 \u0398M . Then clM (A1) = clM (A2) and clM (B1) = clM (B2). Now we need to prove (A1 \u22c3 B1, A2 \u22c3 B2) \u2208 \u0398M , i.e., clM (A1 \u22c3 B1) = clM (A2 \u22c3\nB2). Case 1: clM (A1) = clM (A2) = U or clM (B1) = clM (B2) = U . We may as well suppose clM (A1) = clM (A2) = U , then U = clM (A1) \u2286 clM (A1 \u22c3\nB1) \u2286 clM (U) = U and U = clM (A2) \u2286 clM (A2 \u22c3 B2) \u2286 clM (U) = U , i.e., clM (A1 \u22c3\nB1) = U = clM (A2 \u22c3\nB2). Case 2: clM (A1) = clM (A2) 6= U and clM (B1) = clM (B2) 6= U . According to Proposition 3, we have {H \u2208 H(M) : A2 \u2286 H} = {H \u2208 H(M) : A1 \u2286 H} and {H \u2208 H(M) : B1 \u2286 H} = {H \u2208 H(M) : B2 \u2286 H}. If clM (A1 \u22c3\nB1) 6= U , then clM (A1 \u22c3 B1) = \u22c2 {H \u2208 H(M) : A1 \u22c3 B1 \u2286 H} = \u22c2\n{{H \u2208 H(M) : A1 \u2286 H} \u22c2 {H \u2208 H(M) : B1 \u2286 H}} = \u22c2 {{H \u2208 H(M) : A2 \u2286 H} \u22c2\n{H \u2208 H(M) : B2 \u2286 H}} = \u22c2 {H \u2208 H(M) : A2 \u22c3 B2 \u2286 H} = clM (A2 \u22c3\nB2). If clM (A1 \u22c3 B1) = U , then we claim clM (A2 \u22c3 B2) = U . If clM (A2 \u22c3\nB2) 6= U , then clM (A1 \u22c3 B1) = clM (A2 \u22c3\nB2) 6= U , which implies a contradiction. Therefore, \u0398M is a congruence relation, i.e., (U,\u0398M ) is a dependence space."}, {"heading": "4. Matroidal approach to dependence space", "text": "In matroid theory, there are many greedy algorithms designed using bases of matroids. In practice, the local optimal solutions obtained using these algorithms in matroidal structures are often global ones. As is known, the algorithms for the issues of attribute reduction are almost greedy one. These promote us to establish relationships between the bases of matroids and the reducts of dependence spaces. In Section 3, we have constructed a dependence space by matroids. In this section, we study the reduction problems of the dependence space. It is interesting that the set of redusts of the dependence space is the set of bases of the corresponding matroid. First, we present the concept of consistent sets.\nDefinition 8. (Consistent set [13]) Let (U,\u0398) be a dependence space. A subset X of U is consistent in (U,\u0398) if X is minimal with respect to the inclusion relation in its\n\u0398\u2212class. Otherwise it is inconsistent. The collection of consistent sets of (U,\u0398) is denoted by IND\u0398.\nIn fact, the consistent sets of the dependence space induced by matroids can be equivalently characterized by other words.\nProposition 4. Let M be a matroid of U and X \u2286 U . X \u2208 IND\u0398M if and only if (X,X \u2212 {x}) /\u2208 \u0398M for all x \u2208 X .\nPROOF. According to Theorem 1, we know (U,\u0398M ) is a dependence space. If X \u2208 IND\u0398M , then obviously (X,X \u2212 {x}) /\u2208 \u0398M for all x \u2208 X . Conversely, if X /\u2208 IND\u0398M , then there exists Y \u2282 X such that (Y,X) \u2208 \u0398M . Since Y \u2282 X , there exists x \u2208 X \u2212 Y such that Y \u2286 X \u2212 {x} \u2282 X . According to (Y,X) \u2208 \u0398M , (X \u2212 {x}, X \u2212 {x}) \u2208 \u0398M and (U,\u0398M ) is a dependence space, then (Y \u22c3\n(X \u2212 {x}), X \u22c3\n(X \u2212 {x})) = (X \u2212 {x}, X) \u2208 \u0398M which contradicts the assumption.\nFrom the equivalent characterization, we find that the consistent sets have a close relationship with the independent sets of matroids. First, we review a well-known result of matroid theory.\nLemma 2. [15] Let M be a matroid of U and X \u2286 U . X \u2208 I(M) if and only if x /\u2208 clM (X \u2212 {x}) for all x \u2208 X .\nFor a matroid M , the following theorem indicates that any independent set of the matroid is a consistent set of the corresponding dependence space, and vice versa.\nTheorem 2. Let M be a matroid of U . Then IND\u0398M = I(M).\nPROOF. Suppose X \u2286 U . According to Proposition 4 and Lemma 2, we need to prove that for all x \u2208 X , (X,X \u2212 {x}) /\u2208 \u0398M if and only if x /\u2208 clM (X \u2212 {x}). First, we prove the sufficiency. For all x \u2208 X , x \u2208 clM (X) because X \u2286 clM (X). Combining with x /\u2208 clM (X\u2212{x}), we have clM (X) 6= clM (X\u2212{x}), i.e., (X,X\u2212{x}) /\u2208 \u0398M . Conversely, if there exists x \u2208 X such that x \u2208 clM (X \u2212 {x}), then rM (X) = rM (X \u2212 {x}) which implies X \u2286 clM (X \u2212 {x}), i.e., clM (X) \u2286 clM (X \u2212 {x}). Since X \u2212 {x} \u2286 X , clM (X \u2212 {x}) \u2286 clM (X). Hence clM (X) = clM (X \u2212 {x}), i.e., (X,X \u2212 {x}) \u2208 \u0398M which implies a contradiction.\nBased on the concept of consistent sets, reducts of a dependence space are defined.\nDefinition 9. (Reduct of dependence space [13]) Let (U,\u0398) be a dependence space. For all X \u2286 U , a subset Y of X is called a reduct of X , if (X,Y ) \u2208 \u0398 and Y \u2208 IND\u0398. The set of all reducts of X is denoted by RED\u0398(X).\nTheorem 2 reveals the relationship between the consistent sets of dependence spaces and the independent sets of matroids. Naturally, it motives us to connect the reducts of dependence spaces with other concepts of matroids. At first, an important result in matroids is shown as follows.\nLemma 3. [15] Let M be a matroid of U and X \u2286 U . If BX \u2208 B(M |X), then clM (BX) = clM (X).\nIn fact, the reducts of dependence spaces have a close relationship with the bases of matroids. For a given set, we find that the family of reducts of the set in the dependence space induced by a matroid is a collection of bases of the matroid imposed restriction on the set.\nTheorem 3. Let M be a matroid of U and X \u2286 U . RED\u0398M (X) = B(M |X).\nPROOF. According to the definition of bases of restriction matroids and Theorem 2, we know B(M |X) = Max({B \u2286 X : B \u2208 IND\u0398M}). For any Y \u2208 RED\u0398M (X), then Y \u2208 {B \u2286 X : B \u2208 IND\u0398M}. Next, we need to prove Y \u2208 Max({B \u2286 X : B \u2208 IND\u0398M }). Otherwise, there exists Y1 \u2208 {B \u2286 X : B \u2208 IND\u0398M} such that Y \u2282 Y1. Since Y \u2208 RED\u0398M (X), (X,Y ) \u2208 \u0398M . According to (Y1, Y1) \u2208 \u0398M and \u0398M is a congruence relation, we have (X \u22c3 Y1, Y \u22c3\nY1) \u2208 \u0398M , i.e., (X,Y1) \u2208 \u0398M . Since \u0398M is an equivalence relation, (Y, Y1) \u2208 \u0398M which contradicts Y1 \u2208 IND\u0398M . Therefore, RED\u0398M (X) \u2286 B(M |X). Conversely, since B(M |X) \u2286 I(M), B(M |X) \u2286 IND\u0398M . According to Lemma 3, we know for all Y \u2208 B(M |X), clM (Y ) = clM (X), i.e., (X,Y ) \u2208 \u0398M . Therefore B(M |X) \u2286 RED\u0398M (X).\nFinally, an example is provided to conclude this section.\nExample 2. Suppose matroid M is given in Example 1. Let X = {1, 3}. Since clM ({1}) = clM ({3}) = clM ({1, 3}) = {1, 3}, (X, {1}) \u2208 \u0398M , (X, {3}) \u2208 \u0398M and (X,X) \u2208 \u0398M . Utilizing the definition of consistent sets and clM (\u2205) = \u2205, we know {1} \u2208 IND\u0398M and {3} \u2208 IND\u0398M . Therefore, RED\u0398M (X) = {Y \u2286 X : (X,Y ) \u2208 \u0398M , Y \u2208 IND\u0398M } = {{1}, {3}} = Max({B \u2286 X : B \u2208 I(M)}) = B(M |X)."}, {"heading": "5. Dependence space approach to matroid", "text": "Dependence spaces introduced as a general abstract setting for studying informational dependency can be used to study the matroids. In this section, we present two expressions for the bases of matroids in terms of closed sets through dependence spaces. In fact, the reducts of dependence spaces can be equivalently characterized by the following form.\nProposition 5. Let (U,\u0398) be a dependence space and X \u2286 U . Then RED\u0398(X) = Min({Y \u2286 X : (X,Y ) \u2208 \u0398}).\nPROOF. For all B \u2208 RED\u0398(X), then B \u2208 IND\u0398 and B \u2208 {Y \u2286 X : (X,Y ) \u2208 \u0398}. If B /\u2208 Min({Y \u2286 X : (X,Y ) \u2208 \u0398}), then there exists B1 \u2208 {Y \u2286 X : (X,Y ) \u2208 \u0398} such that B1 \u2282 B. Thus (X,B1) \u2208 \u0398. Combining with (X,B) \u2208 \u0398, then (B1, B) \u2208 \u0398 because \u0398 is transitive. It contradicts that B \u2208 IND\u0398. Therefore RED\u0398(X) \u2286 Min({Y \u2286 X : (X,Y ) \u2208 \u0398}). Conversely, for all B \u2208 Min({Y \u2286 X : (X,Y ) \u2208 \u0398}), we need to prove that B \u2208 IND\u0398. Otherwise, there exists\nB1 \u2286 U such that B1 \u2282 B and (B,B1) \u2208 \u0398. Then B1 \u2286 X and (X,B1) \u2208 \u0398 because B \u2286 X and \u0398 is transitive. That implies that B1 \u2208 {Y \u2286 X : (X,Y ) \u2208 \u0398} which contradicts the minimality of B. Hence Min({Y \u2286 X : (X,Y ) \u2208 \u0398}) \u2286 RED\u0398(X).\nBased on the above results, the following proposition presents an expression of bases from the viewpoint of closed set. For a given subset X of U , it is interesting that any base of the restriction of matroid M to X is minimal in the sense that it does not contain any other element of the family whose any element is contained in X and has the same closure with X .\nTheorem 4. Let M be a matroid of U and X \u2286 U . B(M |X) = Min({Y \u2286 X : clM (Y ) = clM (X)}).\nPROOF. According to Theorem 1, 3 and Proposition 5, B(M |X) = RED\u0398M (X) = Min({Y \u2286 X : clM (Y ) = clM (X)}).\nAs is known, each family H of 2U can define a congruence relation by defining\n\u0393(H) = {(B1, B2) \u2208 2 U \u00d7 2U : \u2200H \u2208 H(B1 \u2286 H \u2194 B2 \u2286 H}).\nBased on the relation, in [14], Novotny\u0300 introduce the concept of dense family. It shows that the family H is dense in a dependence space (U,\u0398) if and only if the congruence relation \u0393(H) defined by H equals to \u0398. The second part of this section, we aim to present the other expression for bases of matroids through dependence spaces. For the purpose, we take the hyperplane family H(M) to induce a congruence relation \u0393(H(M)). The following example help to illustrate the congruence relation.\nExample 3. Suppose matroid M is given in Example 1. It is clear that H(M) = {{2}, {1, 3}}. Let B1 = {1} and B2 = {3}. Then (B1, B2) \u2208 \u0393(H(M)). Because when we take H = {2}, B1 * H and B2 * H which implies B1 \u2286 H \u2194 B2 \u2286 H holds. When we take H = {1, 3}, B1 \u2286 H and B2 \u2286 H which implies B1 \u2286 H \u2194 B2 \u2286 H holds. Let B1 = {2} and B2 = {1, 2}. Then (B1, B2) /\u2208 \u0393(H(M)). Because when we take H = {2}, B1 \u2286 H and B2 * H which implies B1 \u2286 H \u2192 B2 \u2286 H dose not hold. By this way, we can obtain \u0393(H(M)) = \u0398.\nInspired by the example, we find that the congruence relation \u0393(H(M)) is dense in the dependence space (U,\u0398M ).\nProposition 6. Let M be a matroid of U . Then H(M) is dense in (U,\u0398M ).\nPROOF. By the definition of dense family, we need to prove \u0398M = \u0393(H(M)). Utilizing Proposition 3, we have proved the result.\nFor a dependence space, the redusts of a given subset can be characterized by its dense family through the following way.\nLemma 4. [23] Let \u0393 be dense in a dependence space (U,\u0398). For all X \u2286 U , RED\u0398(X) = Min({B \u2286 U : B \u22c2\nT 6= \u2205 (\u2200T \u2208 Com(\u0393)}), where Com(\u0393) = {T 6= \u2205, X \u2212 T \u2208 \u0393}.\nTherefore, we present the other expression for bases of matroids in terms of hyperplanes. In fact, for any element of B(M |X), it is a minimal set with respect to the property of containing at leat one element from each nonempty difference X \u2212H , where H is a hyperplane of M .\nTheorem 5. Let M be a matroid of U and X \u2286 U . Then B(M |X) = Min({B \u2286 U : B \u22c2\nT 6= \u2205 (\u2200T \u2208 Com(H(M))}), where Com(H(M))}) = {T 6= \u2205, X \u2212 T \u2208 H(M))}}.\nPROOF. The result is obtained by combining Proposition 6 with Lemma 4.\nFinally, we show an example to conclude this section.\nExample 4. Suppose the matroid M is given in Example 1 and X = {1, 3}. By Example 1, clM ({1, 3}) = clM ({1}) = clM ({3}) = {1, 3}. On one hand, Min({Y \u2286 X : clM (Y ) = clM (X)}) = {{1}, {3}}. On the other hand, since H(M) = {{2}, {1, 3}}, Com(H(M)) = {T 6= \u2205, X \u2212 T \u2208 H(M)} = {{1, 3}}. Thus Min({T \u2286 U : B \u22c2\nT 6= \u2205 (\u2200T \u2208 Com(H(M))}) = Min({{1}, {3}, {1, 3}}) = {{1}, {3}}. Therefore B(M |X) = Min({Y \u2286 X : clM (Y ) = clM (X)}) = Min({B \u2286 U : B \u22c2 T 6= \u2205 (\u2200T \u2208 Com(H(M))})."}, {"heading": "6.

Rough sets provide a theoretical foundation for the issue. Matroids generalized from matrices have been widely used in many fields, particularly greedy algorithm design, which plays an important role in attribute reduction. Therefore, it is meaningful to combine matroids with rough sets to solve the optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce an existing algebraic structure called dependence space to study the reduction problem in terms of matroids. First, a dependence space of matroids is constructed. Second, the characterizations for the space such as consistent sets and reducts are studied through matroids. Finally, we investigate matroids by the means of the space and present two expressions for their bases. In a word, this paper provides new approaches to study attribute reduction.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
