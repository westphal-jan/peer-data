Introduction", "text": "Terminologies are lightweight ontologies that are used to provide a common vocabulary for a domain of interest together with descriptions of the meaning of terms built from the vocabulary and relationships between them. They are being used in areas such as medical informatics, bio-informatics, and the semantic web to capture domain semantics and promote interoperability. Terminologies are often large and complex. For example, the widely used medical terminology Snomed CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms) contains more than 300 000 term definitions (IHTSDO, 2008). Another example is the National Cancer Institute ontology (NCI) consisting of more than 60 000 axioms (Golbeck, Fragaso, Hartel, Hendler, Oberhaler, & Parsia, 2003). Engineering, maintaining, and using such terminologies is a complex and laborious task, which is practically unfeasible without appropriate tool support. In this article, we focus on a principled logic-based approach to support for terminology versioning.\nDealing with multiple versions of the same information unit is nothing new in computing, and version control is a well established computer technology. Although modern version control systems provide a range of operations including support for collaborative development, branching, merging, etc., these operations extend and rely on the basic operations of\nc\u00a92012 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\ndetecting and representing the differences between versions. In this paper, we focus on this basic problem of versioning.\nThe need for versioning support is recognised by the ontology research community and ontology users, and a large number of approaches and tools have been developed. In our review of currently existing support for ontology versioning, we distinguish three approaches and describe them according to the difference between ontologies they compute:\n1. versioning based on syntactic difference (syntactic diff);\n2. versioning based on structural difference (structural diff);\n3. versioning based on logical difference (logical diff).\nThe syntactic diff underlies most existing version control systems used in software development (Conradi & Westfechtel, 1998) (such as, for example, RCS, CVS, SCCS). It works with text files and represents the difference between versions as blocks of text present in one version but not another, ignoring any meta-information about the document. As observed already in the work of Noy and Musen (2002), ontology versioning cannot rely on a purely syntactic diff operation since many syntactic differences (e.g., the order of ontology axioms) do not affect the semantics of ontologies. Therefore, ontology versioning based on syntactic difference is essentially limited to comparing rather informal change logs (Oliver, Shahar, Shortliffe, & Musen, 1999).\nThe structural diff extends the syntactic diff by taking into account information about the structure of ontologies. It has been suggested for dealing with structured and hierarchical documents such as UML diagrams, database schemas, or XML documents (see, e.g., Ohst, Welle, & Kelter, 2003, and references within). For ontologies, the main characteristic of the structural diff is that it regards them as structured objects, such as an is-a taxonomy (Noy & Musen, 2002), a set of RDF triplets (Klein, Fensel, Kiryakov, & Ognyanov, 2002) or a set of class defining axioms (Redmond, Smith, Drummond, & Tudorache, 2008; Jime\u0301nez-Ruiz, Cuenca Grau, Horrocks, & Llavori, 2011). Changes to ontologies are mostly described in terms of structural operations, for example, adding or deleting a class, extending a class, renaming slots, moving a class from one place in the hierarchy to another, adding or deleting an axiom, class renaming, etc.; sometimes basic logical properties of ontologies, e.g., the equivalence of different structural forms of concepts, are also taken into account (Palma, Haase, Corcho, & Go\u0301mez-Pe\u0301rez, 2009; Jime\u0301nez-Ruiz et al., 2011). Ontology versioning based on structural diff of some form is available in most current ontology editors and ontology management systems either natively or through plugins (Noy & Musen, 2002; Klein et al., 2002; Jime\u0301nez-Ruiz et al., 2011).\nThough very helpful, the structural diff still has the deficiency of having no unambiguous semantic foundation and being syntax dependent. Moreover, it is tailored towards applications of ontologies which are based on the induced concept hierarchy (or some mild extension of it), but does not capture modern applications such as ontology based data access (OBDA) (Poggi, Lembo, Calvanese, Giacomo, Lenzerini, & Rosati, 2008; Lutz, Toman, & Wolter, 2009) in which ontologies are used to provide a user-oriented view of the data\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nand make it accessible via queries formulated solely in the language of the ontology without any knowledge of the actual structure of the data.1\nThe logical diff has only been recently introduced (Konev, Walther, & Wolter, 2008; Kontchakov, Wolter, & Zakharyaschev, 2010) and completely abstracts from the representation of the ontology. Here, an ontology is regarded as a set of axioms formulated in a logical language with a formal and unambiguous semantics. Under this view, ontologies provide answers to queries about some vocabulary of interest. Typical queries include subsumption queries between concepts and, if the ontology is used to access instance data, instance and conjunctive queries. The logical diff is motivated by this view. If two versions of an ontology give the same answers to a class of queries relevant to an application domain, they may be deemed to have no difference regardless of their syntactic or structural form; and queries producing different answers from the versions may be considered as a characterisation of the difference itself. In this way one can, for example, define exactly the differences visible when querying instance data or exactly the differences expressed by subsumptions between concepts.\nTo make this approach work in practice, at least two problems have to be addressed:\n\u2022 For most ontology languages and classes of queries the computational complexity of even detecting if two ontology versions differ over a certain vocabulary is at least one exponential harder than ontology classification and is sometimes undecidable; and even if the computational complexity does not increase, searching for differences between ontologies within a certain vocabulary requires techniques that are very different from those used for standard reasoning (Lutz, Walther, & Wolter, 2007; Lutz & Wolter, 2010; Cuenca Grau, Horrocks, Kazakov, & Sattler, 2008).\n\u2022 If the set of queries producing different answers from the two versions is not empty, it is typically infinite and, therefore, cannot be presented to the user as such. Thus, techniques to succinctly characterise its elements and present them to the user are required.\nThe aim of this paper is to provide first steps toward solutions to these problems for terminologies (aka classical TBoxes) given in the description logic ELHr that extends the description logic EL underlying the OWL 2 EL profile with role inclusions and domain and range restrictions (Baader, Brandt, & Lutz, 2008). Our main contributions are as follows:\n1. It has been argued that syntax-dependence should be regarded as an advantage rather than a deficiency in the context of versioning (Gonc\u0327alves, Parsia, & Sattler, 2011; Jime\u0301nez-Ruiz et al., 2011). For example, Jime\u0301nez-Ruiz et al. argue that logical equivalence between ontologies can be too permissive: \u201ceven if O \u2261 O\u2032 \u2013 the strongest assumption from a semantic point of view \u2013 conflicts may still exist. This might result from the presence of incompatible annotations (statements that act as comments and do not carry logical meaning), or a mismatch in modelling styles; for example, O may be written in a simple language such as the OWL 2 EL profile and contain \u03b1 = (A v BuC), while O\u2032 may contain \u03b2 = (\u00acBt\u00acC v \u00acA). Even though \u03b1 \u2261 \u03b2, the explicit use of negation and disjunction means that O\u2032 is outside the EL profile.\u201d We agree with Jime\u0301nez-Ruiz et al. and Gonc\u0327alves et al. that there are various applications in which a structural rather than logical difference is appropriate. Even a syntactic diff has applications in ontology versioning. In practice, we see logic-based approaches as complementary to structural approaches. An interesting analysis of NCI versions taking into account both structural and logical differences is given in the work of Gonc\u0327alves et al.\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\n\u2022 for subsumption, instance, and conjunctive queries, we present polynomial-time algorithms that decide whether two ELHr-terminologies give different answers to some query from the respective class of queries over a given signature of concept and role names (note that we use the terms signature and vocabulary synonymously).\n\u2022 Besides of a polynomial-time decision procedure detecting differences, we also develop a succinct presentation of the (typically infinite) difference. This presentation can be computed in polynomial time as well.\n\u2022 We present two different types of polynomial-time algorithms for deciding the existence of logical differences between terminologies and for computing a succinct representation of it: the first type of algorithms is conceptually more transparent as it keeps the two input terminologies separate and reduces (a substantial part of) the difference problem to an instance checking problem for an ABox. Such algorithms are, however, not sufficiently efficient on very large inputs. For example, substantial performance problems occur when computing the differences between versions of Snomed CT on their joint signature since the constructed ABox is typically of quadratic size in the input terminologies. The second variant of algorithms, which is based on dynamic programming, is more efficient in practice. It is developed in detail for acyclic ELHr-terminologies. \u2022We present an implementation, CEX2, that is based on the second type of algorithms and computes a succinct representation of the difference between acyclic ELHr-terminologies for the concept and instance query case. In addition, a prototype implementation of the ABox-based algorithm is used to estimate its efficiency.\n\u2022 As an important tool in our investigation, we present description logics, ELran and ELran,u,u, that capture as subsumption differences the instance and query difference between ELHr-terminologies. This result is presented for general ELHr-TBoxes and can, therefore, be exploited in future work on versioning for general ELHr-TBoxes. \u2022 We present experiments using CEX2 that illustrate the efficiency of the algorithms and potential applications to terminologies such as Snomed CT and NCI. A plugin for Prote\u0301ge\u0301 is discussed. CEX2 extends the functionality of the first version of CEX (Konev, Walther, & Wolter, 2008) and of the OwlDiff plugin (Kr\u030cemen, S\u030cm\u0131\u0301d, & Kouba, 2011), which implements the algorithms developed by Konev, Walther, and Wolter. Based on Snomed CT, we also investigate the performance of the ABox-based algorithms in practice.\nThis paper is based on, and extends the work of Konev, Walther, and Wolter (2008).

Preliminaries", "text": "Let NC, NR, and NI be countably infinite and mutually disjoint sets of concept names, role names, and individual names. EL-concepts C are built according to the rule\nC := A | > | C uD | \u2203r.C,\nwhere A \u2208 NC, r \u2208 NR, and C,D range over EL-concepts.

An ELHr-TBox T is a finite set of ELHrinclusions. Inclusions of the form ran(r) v D and ran(r)uC v D are also referred to as range restrictions, and inclusions of the form \u2203r.> v D are referred to as domain restrictions.\nAn ELHr-TBox is called an ELHr-terminology if all its concept inclusions and equations are of the form\n\u2022 A v C and A \u2261 C,\n\u2022 ran(r) v C, and\n\u2022 \u2203r.> v C,\nwhere A \u2208 NC and r \u2208 NR, C is an EL-concept such that C 6= >, C 6= > u >, etc., and no concept name occurs more than once on the left-hand side. Note that, in concept inclusions of the form \u2203r.> v C, the concept \u2203r.> is often denoted dom(r). A terminology is acyclic (or unfoldable) if the process of exhaustively substituting definitions in place of the defined concept names terminates. For example, if a terminology contains a concept inclusion\nMother v \u2203hasMother.Mother\nit is not acyclic. Formally, consider the relation \u227aT between concept names by setting A \u227aT B if there exists an ELHr-inclusion of the form A \u2261 C or A v C in T such that B occurs in C. A terminology T is acyclic if the transitive closure \u227a+T of \u227aT is irreflexive.\nIn description logic, instance data are represented by ABox assertions of the form >(a), A(a) and r(a, b), where a, b \u2208 NI, A \u2208 NC, and r \u2208 NR. An ABox A is a non-empty finite set of ABox-assertions. A is said to be a singleton ABox if it contains exactly one ABox assertion. By obj(A) we denote the set of individual names in A. A knowledge base K (KB) is a pair (T ,A) consisting of a TBox T and an ABox A. Assertions of the form C(a) and r(a, b), where a, b \u2208 NI, C an EL-concept, and r \u2208 NR, are called instance assertions. Note that instance assertions of the form C(a) with C not a concept name nor C = > do not occur in ABoxes.\nThe semantics of ELHr is given by interpretations I = (\u2206I , \u00b7I), where the domain \u2206I is a non-empty set, and \u00b7I is a function mapping each concept name A to a subset AI of \u2206I , each role name r to a binary relation rI \u2286 \u2206I \u00d7\u2206I , and each individual name a to an element aI \u2208 \u2206I . The extension CI of a concept C is defined by induction as follows:\n>I := \u2206I (C uD)I := CI \u2229DI\n(\u2203r.C)I := {d \u2208 \u2206I | \u2203e \u2208 CI : (d, e) \u2208 rI} ran(r)I := {d \u2208 \u2206I | \u2203e : (e, d) \u2208 rI}"}, {"heading": "I satisfies", "text": "\u2022 a concept inclusion C v D, in symbols I |= C v D, if CI \u2286 DI ;\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\n\u2022 a concept equation C \u2261 D, in symbols I |= C \u2261 D, if CI = DI ;\n\u2022 a role inclusion r v s, in symbols I |= r v s, if rI \u2286 sI ;\n\u2022 an assertion C(a), in symbols I |= C(a), if aI \u2208 CI ,\n\u2022 an assertion r(a, b), in symbols I |= r(a, b), if (aI , bI) \u2208 rI .\nWe say that an interpretation I is a model of a TBox T (ABox A) if I |= \u03b1 for all \u03b1 \u2208 T (\u03b1 \u2208 A). An ELHr-inclusion \u03b1 follows from a TBox T if every model of T is a model of \u03b1, in symbols T |= \u03b1. |= \u03b1 is used to denote that \u03b1 follows from the empty TBox and we sometimes write r vT s for T |= r v s. An instance assertion \u03b1 follows from a KB (T ,A) if every individual name that occurs in \u03b1 also occurs in obj(A) and every model of (T ,A) is a model of \u03b1, in symbols (T ,A) |= \u03b1. The most important ways of querying ELHr-TBoxes and KBs are\n\u2022 subsumption: check whether T |= \u03b1, for an ELHr-inclusion \u03b1 and TBox T ,\n\u2022 instance checking: check whether (T ,A) |= \u03b1, for an instance assertion \u03b1 and KB (T ,A), and\n\u2022 conjunctive query answering.\nTo define the latter, call a first-order formula q(~x) a conjunctive query if it is of the form \u2203~y\u03c8(~x, ~y), where \u03c8 is a conjunction of expressions A(t), A \u2208 NC, and r(t1, t2), r \u2208 NR, with t, t1, t2 drawn from NI and the sequences of variables ~x and ~y. Let ~x = x1, . . . , xk. Let I be an interpretation and \u03c0 be a mapping from ~x\u222a ~y into \u2206I . Set \u03c0(a) = aI for all a \u2208 obj(A). We say that a vector ~a = a1, . . . , ak is a \u03c0-match of q(~x) and I if \u03c0 satisfies the following conditions:\n\u2022 \u03c0(t) \u2208 AI for every conjunct A(t) of \u03c8;\n\u2022 (\u03c0(t1), \u03c0(t2)) \u2208 rI for every conjunct r(t1, t2) of \u03c8;\n\u2022 \u03c0(xi) = aIi for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k.\nWe set I |= q[~a] if, and only if, there exists a \u03c0 such that ~a is a \u03c0-match of q(~x) and I. Let (T ,A) be a KB. Then a sequence ~a of members of obj(A) is a certain answer to q(~x) of a KB (T ,A), in symbols (T ,A) |= q(~a), if I |= q[~a], for every model I of (T ,A).\nAll three types of querying ELHr-TBoxes have been studied extensively. The complexity of subsumption and instance checking is in PTime (Baader et al., 2008). The combined complexity of answering Boolean conjunctive queries (i.e., deciding whether (T ,A) |= q for a conjunctive query q without free variables) is coNP-complete (Rosati, 2007) and its data complexity is in PTime (Rosati, 2007). Information on reasoners for subsumption checking for ELHr can be found in the work of Delaitre and Kazakov (2009), Kazakov, Kro\u0308tzsch, and Simancik (2011), and Mendez and Suntisrivaraporn (2009). Lutz et al.

Of course, which formulas \u03d5 are relevant depends on the application domain. In many applications only subsumptions between concepts are relevant, but if TBoxes are employed to access instance data, then answers to instance or even conjunctive queries can be relevant as well. In addition, in applications of large-scale terminologies such as Snomed CT and NCI typically only a very small subset of the vocabulary of the terminology is relevant. Thus, a meaningful notion of logical difference should take into account only those formulas that are given in a certain signature of interest, where a signature \u03a3 is a subset of NC \u222aNR. Given a concept, role, concept inclusion, TBox, ABox, or query E, we denote by sig(E) the signature of E, that is, the set of concept and role names occurring in it.

We say that T1 and T2 are \u03a3-concept inseparable, in symbols T1 \u2261C\u03a3 T2, if cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) = cDiff\u03a3(T2, T1) = \u2205.\n\u03a3-concept inseparability between T1 and T2 means that T1 can be replaced by T2 in any application that is only concerned with ELHr\u03a3-inclusions.2 As the following example shows, however, \u03a3-concept inseparable terminologies can give different answers for the same instance query and data.\nExample 4. Let T1 = {ran(r) v A1, ran(s) v A2, B \u2261 A1 u A2}, T2 = \u2205,\u03a3 = {r, s, B}. One can show that T1 and T2 are \u03a3-concept inseparable. However, for the \u03a3-ABox A = {r(a, c), s(b, c)} we have (T1,A) |= B(c) but (T2,A) 6|= B(c).\nTo take into account the differences between TBoxes that are relevant if TBoxes are used to access instance data, we consider the \u03a3-instance difference.\nDefinition 5 (\u03a3-instance difference). The \u03a3-instance difference between TBoxes T1 and T2 is the set iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) of pairs of the form (A, \u03b1), where A is a \u03a3-ABox and \u03b1 a \u03a3-instance assertion such that (T1,A) |= \u03b1 and (T2,A) 6|= \u03b1. We say that T1 and T2 are \u03a3-instance inseparable, in symbols T1 \u2261i\u03a3 T2, if iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) = iDiff\u03a3(T2, T1) = \u2205.\nIn contrast to ELHr, it has been shown by Lutz and Wolter (2010) that for EL-TBoxes there is no difference between \u03a3-concept inseparability and \u03a3-instance inseparability. In this paper we extend this result to ELHr-TBoxes without range restrictions (the proof is given after Corollary 37):\nTheorem 6. Let T1 and T2 be ELHr-TBoxes without range restrictions and \u03a3 a signature. Then T1 \u2261C\u03a3 T2 if, and only if, T1 \u2261i\u03a3 T2.\nSometimes, instance queries are not sufficiently expressive, and conjunctive queries are employed. In that case, the following notion of difference is appropriate.\nDefinition 7 (\u03a3-query-difference). The \u03a3-query difference between TBoxes T1 and T2 is the set qDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) of pairs of the form (A, q(~a)), where A is a \u03a3-ABox, q(~x) a \u03a3conjunctive query, and ~a a tuple of individual names in A such that (T1,A) |= q(~a) and (T2,A) 6|= q(~a). We say that T1 and T2 are \u03a3-query inseparable, in symbols T1 \u2261q\u03a3 T , if qDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) = qDiff\u03a3(T2, T1) = \u2205.\nAs observed by Lutz and Wolter (2010) already, even for EL \u03a3-instance inseparability does not imply \u03a3-query inseparability. The following is a simple example.\nExample 8. Let T1 = {A v \u2203r.B}, T2 = \u2205,\u03a3 = {A,B}. Then T1 and T2 are \u03a3-instance inseparable, but they are not \u03a3-query inseparable. Consider the \u03a3-ABox A = {A(a)} and the \u03a3-query q = \u2203x.B(x). Then (T1,A) |= q but (T2,A) 6|= q.\n2. We refer the reader to the conclusion of this paper for a brief discussion of this claim.\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nIt is shown by Lutz and Wolter (2010) that Example 8 is essentially the only situation in which there is a difference between \u03a3-instance inseparability and \u03a3-query inseparability in EL: the two notions become equivalent for EL if the universal role is admitted in instance queries (e.g., in Example 8, the conjunctive query \u2203x.B(x) corresponds to the instance query \u2203u.B(a) for the universal role u). In contrast, for ELHr there are more subtle differences between the instance and the query case.\nExample 9. Let T1 = {A v \u2203s.>, s v r1, s v r2}, T2 = {A v \u2203r1.> u \u2203r2.>},\u03a3 = {A, r1, r2}. Then T1 and T2 are \u03a3-concept and \u03a3-instance inseparable, but they are not \u03a3-query inseparable. To show the latter, let A = {A(a)} and let q = \u2203x(r1(a, x)\u2227 r2(a, x)). Then (T1,A) |= q but (T2,A) 6|= q.\nWe have seen that \u03a3-concept inseparability does not imply \u03a3-instance inseparability and that \u03a3-instance inseparability does not imply \u03a3-query inseparability. The converse implications, however, hold:\nLemma 10. For all ELHr-TBoxes T1 and T2 and all signatures \u03a3:\nT1 \u2261q\u03a3 T2 \u21d2 T1 \u2261 i \u03a3 T2 \u21d2 T1 \u2261C\u03a3 T2.\nProof. The first implication follows from the observation that every instance query can be regarded as a conjunctive query. For the second implication, note first that if s v r \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2), then ({s(a, b)}, r(a, b)) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2). Now let C v D \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2). One can construct a \u03a3-ABox AC with individual a such that for all EL-concepts D\u2032: (T ,AC) |= D\u2032(a) if, and only if, T |= C v D\u2032 (cf. Lemma 36). Thus (AC , D(a)) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2).\nHaving introduced three notions of difference between ELHr-TBoxes, we now investigate two problems: (i) how to detect whether there is any difference between two ELHrterminologies and, if so, (ii) how to represent the differences.\nIn what follows we assume that the fresh symbols used in the normalised form of terminologies do not occur in the signature \u03a3 for which we compute the difference between terminologies. Then we obtain the following lemma as a direct corollary of Lemma 1.\nLemma 11. For any ELHr-terminologies T1, T2 and their normalised forms T \u20321 , T \u20322 as defined in Lemma 1, we have that the following hold:\n\u2022 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) = cDiff\u03a3(T \u20321 , T \u20322 );\n\u2022 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) = iDiff\u03a3(T \u20321 , T \u20322 );\n\u2022 qDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) = qDiff\u03a3(T \u20321 , T \u20322 ).\nFrom now on, unless stated otherwise, we consider normalised terminologies only.\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\n4. The Case of EL-Terminologies\nBefore investigating the logical difference for ELHr-terminologies, we illustrate the main ideas behind the proofs by considering the \u03a3-concept difference for EL-terminologies. An EL-terminology is an ELHr-terminology consisting of EL-inclusions only, that is, concept inclusions of the form A v C and concept equations of the form A \u2261 C. We start with the observation that even for acyclic EL-terminologies there are T1 and T2 in which cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) contains inclusions of at least exponential size only. Thus, when searching for witness inclusions in cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2), one has to deal with the case in which all witness inclusions have at least exponential size.\nExample 12. Consider\nT1 = {A0 v B0, A1 \u2261 Bn} \u222a {Bi+1 \u2261 \u2203r.Bi u \u2203s.Bi | 0 \u2264 i < n} T2 = {A1 v F0} \u222a {Fi v \u2203r.Fi+1 u \u2203s.Fi+1 | 0 \u2264 i < n}\nand \u03a3 = {A0, A1, r, s}. Then a concept inclusion in cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) of minimal size is given by Cn v A1, where\nC0 = A0 and Ci+1 = \u2203r.Ci u \u2203s.Ci, for i \u2265 0.\nClearly, Cn is of exponential size. Note, however, that if we use structure sharing and define the size of Cn as the number of its subconcepts, then Cn is only of polynomial size.\nWe now derive basic properties of EL-terminologies using a sequent calculus."}, {"heading": "4.1 Proof System for EL", "text": "We derive basic properties of EL from the Gentzen-style sequent calculus presented by Hofmann (2005); see Figure 1. The calculus operates on sequents of the form C v D, where C,D are EL-concepts; here the symbol v is treated as a syntactic separator. A derivation (or, equivalently, a proof ) of a sequent C v D is a finite rooted tree whose nodes are labelled with sequents, whose root is labelled with C v D, whose leaves are labelled with axioms (instances of Ax or AxTop) and whose internal nodes are labelled with the result of an application of one of the inference rules to the labels of their children. The length of a derivation is the number of rule applications in the derivation.\nExample 13. Let T = {A \u2261 B1uB2, F v B1}. A derivation D of the sequent \u2203r.(FuB2) v \u2203r.A is shown below. The root of the derivation D is labelled with \u2203r.(F uB2) v \u2203r.A and the two leaves with B1 v B1 and B2 v B2, respectively.\nB1 v B1 (Ax)\nF v B1 (PDefL)\nF uB2 v B1 (AndL1)\nB2 v B2 (Ax)\nF uB2 v B2 (AndL2)\nF uB2 v B1 uB2 (AndR)\nF uB2 v A (DefR)\n\u2203r.(F uB2) v \u2203r.A (Ex)\nNotice that the basic calculus of Hofmann (2005) considers EL without the constant > and for terminologies without concept inclusions. To take care of >, we have added the rule (AxTop), and (PDefL) is the rule representing inclusions of the form A v C. Cutelimination, completeness, and correctness can now be shown in a straightforward extension of the proof given by Hofmann.\nFor a terminology T and concepts C,D, we write T ` C v D if, and only if, there exists a proof of C v D in the calculus of Figure 1.\nTheorem 14 (Hofmann). For all EL-terminologies T and concepts C,D, it holds that T |= C v D if, and only if, T ` C v D.\nWe apply this calculus to derive a description of the syntactic form of concepts C such that T |= C v D, where D is non-conjunctive in T .\nLemma 15. Let T be a normalised EL-terminology, r a role name, A a concept name and D an EL-concept.\n1. Assume\nT |= l\n1\u2264i\u2264n Ai u\nl\n1\u2264j\u2264m \u2203rj .Cj v A,\nwhere A is pseudo-primitive in T , Ai are concept names for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, Cj are ELconcepts for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, and m,n \u2265 0. Then there exists Ai, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, such that T |= Ai v A.\n2. Assume now\nT |= l\n1\u2264i\u2264n Ai u\nl\n1\u2264j\u2264m \u2203rj .Cj v \u2203r.D,\nwhere Ai are concept names for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, Cj are EL-concepts for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, and m,n \u2265 0. Then\n\u2022 there exists Ai, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, such that T |= Ai v \u2203r.D or \u2022 there exists rj, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, such that rj = r and T |= Cj v D.\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nProof. We use Theorem 14. First, we prove Point 1. Let C = d 1\u2264i\u2264nAi u d\n1\u2264j\u2264m \u2203rj .Cj and assume T |= C v A, where A is pseudo-primitive in T . Let D be a proof of C v A. Note that, since A is pseudo-primitive in T (and a concept name), by inspecting the form of the conclusions of the inference rules, one can see that the root of the derivation D can only have been derived by either Ax, AndL1, AndL2, DefL, or PDefL. We now show that there exists Ai, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, such that T |= Ai v A by induction on n + m, i.e. the number of conjuncts in C. It is easy to see that n+m \u2265 1 as T 6|= > v A by definition of terminologies T .\nThe base case of n+m = 1 is trivial: the root of D can only have been derived by one of Ax, DefL, or PDefL; so, we can conclude that C = A1; i.e. n = 1, m = 0, and we set Ai = A1.\nAssume n + m > 1. Then the root of D can only have been derived by either AndL1 or AndL2. In both cases, the premise used in the application of either inference rule is a sequent C \u2032 v A such that either C = C \u2032 u D or C = D u C \u2032 for an EL-concept D. Thus, C \u2032 contains less conjuncts than C (but still at least one). We can also conclude that T |= C \u2032 v A holds by Theorem 14. By applying the induction hypothesis, there hence exists a concept name Ai which is a conjunct of C\n\u2032 such that T |= Ai v A. Finally, we still note that Ai is also a conjunct of C.\nWe now prove Point 2. Let C = d 1\u2264i\u2264nAiu d\n1\u2264j\u2264m \u2203rj .Cj and assume T |= C v \u2203r.D. LetD be a proof of C v \u2203r.D. Note that due to the form of the right-hand side of the sequent C v \u2203r.D, the rule used to derive the root of D can only have been one of Ax, AndL1, AndL2, DefL, PDefL, or Ex. We now prove that either there exists Ai, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, such that T |= Ai v \u2203r.D, or there exists rj , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m, with rj = r and T |= Cj v D by induction on n+m again. Similarly to above, we have n+m \u2265 1.\nIf n+m = 1, the rule used to derive the root of D can only have been one of Ax, DefL, PDefL, or Ex. We have two subcases:\n\u2022 the root of D was derived with DefL or PDefL: then n = 1, m = 0 and C = A1; i.e. T |= Ai v \u2203r.D for Ai = A1.\n\u2022 the root of D was derived with Ax or Ex: then n = 0, m = 1, C = \u2203r1.C1, and r1 = r. If C1 = D, then obviously T |= C1 v D holds. Otherwise, the rule Ex was used to derive the root of D and T ` C1 v D holds, which implies that T |= C1 v D. Thus, in any case, rj = r and T |= Cj v D holds for j = 1.\nThe case n+m > 1 can be proved by induction analogously to the proof of Point 1 above.\nWe apply Lemma 15 to elements of cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2).\nTheorem 16 (Primitive witness for EL). Let T1 and T2 be EL-terminologies and \u03a3 a signature. If \u03d5 \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2), then either C v A or A v D is a member of cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2), where A \u2208 sig(\u03d5) is a concept name and C, D are EL-concepts occurring in \u03d5.\nProof. Let \u03d5 = C v D \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2). The proof is by induction on the construction of D. We have D 6= > as T2 |= C v >. If D = D1 uD2, then one of C v Di, i = 1, 2, is in cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) and we can apply the induction hypothesis. If D = \u2203r.D1 then, by Lemma 15,\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\neither (i) there exists a conjunct A of C, A a concept name, such that T1 |= A v D, or (ii) there exists a conjunct \u2203r.C1 of C with T1 |= C1 v D1.\nIn case (i) it follows that T2 6|= A v D as otherwise T2 |= C v D and C v D 6\u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) due to |= C v A. Hence, A v D \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2).\nFinally, for case (ii) we obtain T2 6|= C1 v D1 as otherwise |= C v \u2203r.C1, T2 |= \u2203r.C1 v D and C v D 6\u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) again. Thus, C1 v D1 \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) and we can apply the induction hypothesis.\nBy Theorem 16, every inclusion C v D in the \u03a3-concept difference of T1 and T2 \u201ccontains\u201d a basic witness inclusion that has a concept name either on the right-hand side or the left-hand side. We define\n\u2022 the set of left-hand \u03a3-concept difference witnesses, cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2), as the set of all A \u2208 \u03a3 \u2229 NC such that there exists a concept D with A v D \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) and\n\u2022 the set of right-hand \u03a3-concept difference witnesses, cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2), as the set of all A \u2208 \u03a3 \u2229 NC such that there exists a concept C with C v A \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2).\nWe regard the concept names in cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) and cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) as a succinct and, in a certain sense, complete representation of the \u03a3-concept difference between T1 and T2 and define the set of all \u03a3-concept difference witnesses as\ncWtn\u03a3(T1, T2) = (cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2), cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2)).\nIn what follows, we first present a polytime algorithm computing cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2). A polytime algorithm computing cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) has already been given by Lutz and Wolter (2010) (for EL-TBoxes). We briefly present it since an extension will be developed when we consider ELHr-terminologies. Both algorithms together decide \u03a3-concept inseparability since, by Theorem 16, T1 and T2 are \u03a3-concept inseparable if, and only if, cWtn\u03a3(T1, T2) = cWtn\u03a3(T2, T1) = (\u2205, \u2205).\n4.2 Computing cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2)\nLet A \u2208 \u03a3 and assume we want to decide whether A \u2208 cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2). Thus, we want to decide whether there exists a \u03a3-concept C such that T1 |= C v A and T2 6|= C v A. Our general strategy is as follows. Let\nnoimplyT2,\u03a3(A) = {C | T2 6|= C v A, C an EL\u03a3-concept}.\nWe aim at an algorithm that checks whether noimplyT2,\u03a3(A) contains some C with T1 |= C v A. For two sets C and D of concepts we call C a cover of D if C \u2286 D and for all D \u2208 D there exists a C \u2208 C such that |= C v D. Thus, C \u2286 noimplyT2,\u03a3(A) is a cover of noimplyT2,\u03a3(A) if for all D \u2208 noimplyT2,\u03a3(A) there exists a C \u2208 C such that |= C v D. Note that if C is a cover of noimplyT2,\u03a3(A), then there exists some \u03a3-concept C such that C v A \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) if, and only if, there exists some C \u2208 C such that T1 |= C v A. Thus we have reduced the original problem to the construction of an appropriate cover C and deciding the subsumption problem T1 |= C v A, for C \u2208 C. Unfortunately, in general, no finite cover exists. The following example illustrates the situation.\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nExample 17. (1) Let \u03a3 = {A,B, r} and T2 = \u2205. Then noimplyT2,\u03a3(A) contains all \u03a3concepts that do not have A as an atomic conjunct. Clearly, noimplyT2,\u03a3(A) contains no finite cover.\n(2) Let \u03a3\u2032 = {A,B, r} and T \u20322 = {A \u2261 \u2203r.A}. Then noimplyT \u20322 ,\u03a3\u2032(A) contains all \u03a3\u2032 \\ {A}-concepts and contains no finite cover.\n(3) Let \u03a3\u2032\u2032 = {A,B1, B2} and T \u2032\u20322 = {A \u2261 B1 u B2}. Then {B1, B2} is a cover of noimplyT \u2032\u20322 ,\u03a3\u2032\u2032(A).\nAs a consequence, instead of directly constructing a cover of noimplyT2,\u03a3(A), we first construct transparent and small covers of\nnoimplyT2,\u03a3(A) \u2229 {C | depth(C) \u2264 n},\nfor all n \u2265 0, where depth(C) is the role-depth of C; i.e., the number of nestings of existential restrictions in C.3 Those covers are denoted noimplynT2,\u03a3(A), n \u2265 0, and are singleton sets if A is non-conjunctive in T2 and finite sets containing at most k concepts if A \u2261 B1u\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7uBk \u2208 T2. Based on this sequence, we present two distinct algorithms for computing cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2):\n1. we encode the infinite sequence noimplynT2,\u03a3(A), n \u2265 0, into a polynomial-size ABox AT2,\u03a3. In this way we obtain a reduction of the original problem to an instance checking problem for the knowledge base (T1,AT2,\u03a3). In a certain sense, the ABox AT2,\u03a3 encodes a (in general infinite) cover of noimplyT2,\u03a3(A).\n2. we employ the terminology T1 in a dynamic programming approach to decide which concepts in noimplynT2,\u03a3(A) are relevant for deciding whether A \u2208 cWtn rhs \u03a3 (T1, T2).\nAlthough less transparent, for large terminologies the latter approach is considerably more efficient. We develop it for acyclic terminologies.\nFor an EL-terminology T , a concept name A and a signature \u03a3, set\npre\u03a3T (A) = {B \u2208 \u03a3 | T |= B v A}.\nThe finite covers noimplynT2,\u03a3(A), n \u2265 0, are defined in Figure 2. For n = 0, the set noimplynT2,\u03a3(A) consists of concepts without role names. We distinguish between conjunctive and non-conjunctive A. Note that if A is non-conjunctive, then noimplynT2,\u03a3(A) is a singleton set. Example 17 (3) shows that this is not always the case for conjunctive A. For n + 1, we distinguish between pseudo-primitive concept names, conjunctive concept names, and those that have a definition of the form A \u2261 \u2203r.C. Again, for nonconjunctive A, noimplyn+1T2,\u03a3(A) is a singleton set. Note that the concepts all n \u03a3 are covers of {C | depth(C) \u2264 n, C an EL\u03a3-concept}, for all n \u2265 0. We illustrate the definitions using the EL-terminologies from Example 17.\nExample 18. (1) Let \u03a3 = {A,B, r} and T2 = \u2205. Then A and B are non-conjunctive in T2 and noimply0T2,\u03a3(A) = {B} and noimply 0 T2,\u03a3(B) = {A}. A and B are also pseudo-primitive in T2, and so noimply1T2,\u03a3(A) = {B u \u2203r.(A uB)} and noimply 1 T2,\u03a3(B) = {A u \u2203r.(A uB)}.\n3. More precisely depth(A) = 0, depth(C1 u C2) = max{depth(C1), depth(C2)}, and depth(\u2203r.D) = depth(D) + 1.\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\n(2) Let \u03a3\u2032 = {A,B, r} and T \u20322 = {A \u2261 \u2203r.A}. Then A and B are non-conjunctive in T \u20322 and noimply0T \u20322 ,\u03a3\u2032 (A) = {B} and noimply0T \u20322 ,\u03a3\u2032(B) = {A}. B is pseudo-primitive in T \u2032 2 and so noimply1T2,\u03a3(B) = {A u \u2203r.(A uB)}.

Since \u03a3 does not contain any role names, we have noimply0T \u2032\u20322 ,\u03a3\u2032\u2032 (X) = noimplynT \u2032\u20322 ,\u03a3\u2032\u2032 (X), for all X \u2208 {A,B1, B2} and n > 0.\nThe following lemma shows the correctness of the definition of noimplynT2,\u03a3(A).\nLemma 19. Let T2 be a normalised EL-terminology, \u03a3 be a signature, and A \u2208 NC. Then noimplynT2,\u03a3(A) is a cover of noimplyT2,\u03a3(A) \u2229 {C | depth(C) \u2264 n}. Namely, for all n \u2265 0,\nC1. T2 6|= C v A, for all C \u2208 noimplynT2,\u03a3(A).\nC2. For all EL\u03a3-concepts D with n = depth(D), if T2 6|= D v A, then |= C v D for some C \u2208 noimplynT2,\u03a3(A).\nIn particular, \u22c3 n\u22650 noimply n T2,\u03a3(A) is a cover of noimplyT2,\u03a3(A).\nProof. C1. Assume first that A is pseudo-primitive in T2. Then noimplynT2,\u03a3(A) consists of C =\nd A\u2032\u2208(\u03a3\\pre\u03a3T2 (A))\nA\u2032 u F , where F is a (possibly empty) conjunction of concepts of the form \u2203s.Fi. By Lemma 15, T2 6|= C v A because the only atomic conjuncts of C are in \u03a3 \\ pre\u03a3T2(A).\nWe now prove C1 for concept names A which are not pseudo-primitive in T2. The proof is by induction on n. For n = 0 and A \u2261 \u2203r.B \u2208 T2, assume T2 |=\nd A\u2032\u2208(\u03a3\\pre\u03a3T2 (A))\nA\u2032 v A. As A \u2261 \u2203r.B \u2208 T2, we have by Lemma 15 that there must exist A\u2032 \u2208 \u03a3 \\ pre\u03a3T2(A) with T2 |= A\u2032 v A. But this contradicts the definition of the set pre\u03a3T2(A)). For n = 0 and A conjunctive with A \u2261 F \u2208 T2, let C \u2208 noimplynT2,\u03a3(A) = \u22c3 B\u2208F noimply n T2,\u03a3(B). There hence exists an atomic conjunct B of F such that C \u2208 noimplynT2,\u03a3(B). As T2 is normalised, B is non-conjunctive, i.e. property C1 has already been proved above for B. Thus, T2 6|= C v B, which implies that T2 6|= C v A as otherwise T2 |= C v B would hold.\nFor the induction step, assume C1 has been proved for n \u2265 0. Let A \u2261 \u2203r.B \u2208 T2 and let Cn+1T2,\u03a3 be the only element of noimply n+1 T2,\u03a3(A). Assume\nT2 |= Cn+1T2,\u03a3 v A. By Lemma 15 there are two possibilities:\n\u2022 T2 |= d A\u2032\u2208(\u03a3\\pre\u03a3T2 (A))\nA\u2032 v \u2203r.B. Similarly to above, the claim follows from Lemma 15 and the fact that A \u2261 \u2203r.B \u2208 T2.\n\u2022 r \u2208 \u03a3 and there exists E \u2208 noimplynT2,\u03a3(B) such that T2 |= E v B. This is excluded by the induction hypothesis.\nWe have derived a contradiction. The case A \u2261 F \u2208 T2, A conjunctive in T2, is considered analogously to the case n = 0.\nC2. Let n = 0 and assume first that A is non-conjunctive. Let D be a \u03a3-concept with depth(D) = 0 and T2 6|= D v A. Then all conjuncts of D are in \u03a3 \\ pre\u03a3T2(A) and we obtain |=\nd A\u2032\u2208\u03a3\\pre\u03a3T2 (A)\nA\u2032 v D. Now assume A is conjunctive in T2 and A \u2261 F \u2208 T2. Let D be a \u03a3-concept with depth(D) = 0 and T2 6|= D v A. Then T2 6|= D v B, for some conjunct B of F . By induction, |= C v D for the (unique as B must be non-conjunctive) C \u2208 noimply0T2,\u03a3(B), and therefore |= C v D for some C \u2208 noimply 0 T2,\u03a3(A).\nFor the induction step, assume that C2 has been shown for n. Let D be a \u03a3-concept with T2 6|= D v A and depth(D) = n+ 1.\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\n(a) Let A be pseudo-primitive in T2. Then the atomic conjuncts of D are included in \u03a3 \\ pre\u03a3T2(A). Now |= C v D follows immediately for C = d A\u2032\u2208\u03a3\\pre\u03a3T2 (A) A\u2032 u d s\u2208\u03a3 \u2203s.all n \u03a3.\n(b) Let A \u2261 \u2203r.B \u2208 T2. Let Cn+1T2,\u03a3 be the only element of noimply n+1 T2,\u03a3(A) and assume\nD = l\nE\u2208Q0\nE u l\n(s,D\u2032)\u2208Q1\n\u2203s.D\u2032.\nThen Q0 \u2286 \u03a3 \\ pre\u03a3T2(A). Hence, |= C n+1 T2,\u03a3 v d E\u2208Q0 E. Now consider a conjunct \u2203s.D\n\u2032 of D. We distinguish two cases:\n\u2022 if s 6= r, then |= Cn+1T2,\u03a3 v \u2203s.D \u2032, as required.\n\u2022 if s = r, then s \u2208 \u03a3 and it is sufficient to show that there exists E \u2208 noimplynT2,\u03a3(B) such that |= E v D\u2032. Suppose there does not exist such an E. Then, by (the contraposition of) the induction hypothesis, T2 |= D\u2032 v B. But this contradicts T2 6|= D v A (as A \u2261 \u2203r.B \u2208 T2).\n(c) A is conjunctive in T2 and A \u2261 F \u2208 T2. This case is analogous to the case in which A is conjunctive in T2 and n = 0.\nCorollary 20. For all normalised EL-terminologies T1 and T2 and all A \u2208 NC the following conditions are equivalent:\n\u2022 there exists an EL\u03a3-concept C such that T1 |= C v A and T2 6|= C v A;\n\u2022 there exists n \u2265 0 and C \u2208 noimplynT2,\u03a3(A) such that T1 |= C v A.\nObserve that a direct application of Corollary 20 does not yield a procedure for computing cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) as it gives no bound on n for the set noimplynT2,\u03a3(A). At this point we present two ways of avoiding this problem (as well as the problem that concepts in noimplynT2,\u03a3(A) can be of exponential size). Firstly, instead of working with covers we construct an ABox encoding covers. In contrast to concepts, ABoxes admit the encoding of structure sharing and cycles and so, intuitively, admit the polynomial reconstruction of the \u2018infinite concept\u2019\nd n\u22650,C\u2208noimplynT2,\u03a3(A) C.\nThe ABox AT2,\u03a3 is constructed in Figure 3, where for a normalised EL-terminology T and a concept name A \u2208 sig(T ), we set\nnon-conjT (A) = { {A}, A is non-conjunctive in T {B1, . . . , Bn}, A \u2261 B1 u \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 uBn \u2208 T\nNote that the construction of AT2,\u03a3 is very similar to the construction of noimplynT2,\u03a3(A). The assertions for the individual \u03be\u03a3 play the role of the concepts all n \u03a3, n \u2265 0, and the assertions for the individuals \u03beA play the role of the sets noimply n T2,\u03a3(A), n \u2265 0. In fact, one can readily show that AT2,\u03a3 |= C(\u03beA) for any C \u2208 noimplynT2,\u03a3(A) and A non-conjunctive in T2 and, conversely, (a more involved proof) shows that whenever AT2,\u03a3 |= D(\u03beA) for some EL-concept D, then there exist n \u2265 0 and C \u2208 noimplynT2,\u03a3(A) such that |= C v D. We illustrate the construction of AT2,\u03a3 using the EL-terminologies from Example 17.\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nExample 21. (1) Let \u03a3 = {A,B, r} and T2 = \u2205. Then\nAT2,\u03a3 = {A(\u03beB), B(\u03beA), r(\u03beA, \u03be\u03a3), r(\u03beB, \u03be\u03a3)} \u222a A\u03a3,\nwhere A\u03a3 = {A(\u03be\u03a3), B(\u03be\u03a3), r(\u03be\u03a3, \u03be\u03a3)}. (2) Let \u03a3\u2032 = {A,B, r} and T \u20322 = {A \u2261 \u2203r.A}. Then\nAT \u20322 ,\u03a3\u2032 = {A(\u03beB), B(\u03beA), r(\u03beA, \u03beA), r(\u03beB, \u03be\u03a3\u2032)} \u222a A\u03a3\u2032 ,\nwhere A\u03a3\u2032 = {A(\u03be\u03a3\u2032), B(\u03be\u03a3\u2032), r(\u03be\u03a3\u2032 , \u03be\u03a3\u2032)}. (3) Let \u03a3\u2032\u2032 = {A,B1, B2} and T \u2032\u20322 = {A \u2261 B1 uB2}. Then\nAT \u2032\u20322 ,\u03a3\u2032\u2032 = {B1(\u03beB2), B2(\u03beB1)} \u222a A\u03a3\u2032\u2032 ,\nwhere A\u03a3\u2032\u2032 = {A(\u03be\u03a3\u2032\u2032), B1(\u03be\u03a3\u2032\u2032), B2(\u03be\u03a3\u2032\u2032)}.\nWe now obtain the following characterisation of cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2).\nTheorem 22. Let T1 and T2 be normalised EL-terminologies and \u03a3 a signature. Then the following conditions are equivalent for any A \u2208 \u03a3:\n\u2022 A \u2208 cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2);\n\u2022 there exist n \u2265 0 and C \u2208 noimplynT2,\u03a3(A) such that T1 |= C v A;\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\n\u2022 (T1,AT2,\u03a3) |= A(\u03beB) for some B \u2208 non-conjT2(A).\nThe equivalence of Points 1 and 2 follows from Corollary 20. We do not give a detailed proof of the equivalence of Points 2 and 3 as this follows from the more general results for ELHr-terminologies we present below.\nExample 23. For a normalised form of the terminologies from Example 12,\nT1 = {A0 v B0, A1 \u2261 Bn} \u222a {Bi+1 \u2261 B\u2032i+1 uB\u2032\u2032i+1 | 0 \u2264 i < n} \u222a {B\u2032i+1 \u2261 \u2203r.Bi | 0 \u2264 i < n} \u222a {B\u2032\u2032i+1 \u2261 \u2203s.Bi | 0 \u2264 i < n} T2 = {A1 v F0} \u222a {Fi \u2261 F \u2032i u F \u2032\u2032i | 0 \u2264 i < n} \u222a {F \u2032i v \u2203r.Fi+1 | 0 \u2264 i < n} \u222a {F \u2032\u2032i v \u2203s.Fi+1 | 0 \u2264 i < n},\nand \u03a3 = {A0, A1, r, s}, the ABox AT2,\u03a3 can be graphically represented as\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03be\u03a3\nA0,A1\n\u03beA1 A0\n\u03beA0 A1 \u03beF \u20320\nA0\n\u03beF \u2032\u20320 A0\n\u03beF \u20321 A0,A1\n\u03beF \u2032\u20321 A0,A1\n\u03beF \u2032n A0,A1\n\u03beF \u2032\u2032n A0,A1r, s\nr, s\nr, s\nr, s\nr, s\nr, s\nr, s\nr, s\nr, s\nIt should be clear that (T1,AT2,\u03a3) |= A1(\u03beA1). In fact, (T1,A) |= A1(\u03beA1) holds already for the restriction A of AT2,\u03a3 to the individuals {\u03beA1 , \u03be\u03a3}.\nTheorem 24. For EL-terminologies T1 and T2 and a signature \u03a3, the set cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) can be computed in polynomial time.\nProof. It suffices to give a polynomial time algorithm that decides for every A \u2208 \u03a3 whether A \u2208 cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2). First, the ABox AT2,\u03a3 can be computed in polynomial time and is of quadratic size in T2. By Theorem 22, A \u2208 cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) iff (T1,AT2,\u03a3) |= A(\u03beB) for some B \u2208 non-conjT2(A), and the latter condition can be checked in polynomial time since instance checking is in polynomial time for EL-TBoxes.\nRegarding the efficiency of this approach, observe that for typical terminologies and large \u03a3, the ABox AT2,\u03a3 is indeed of quadratic size in T2 since \u03a3 \\ pre\u03a3T2(A) will typically contain most of the concept names in \u03a3. Thus, for very large terminologies and \u03a3 a straightforward implementation of this rather elegant algorithm does not work efficiently as one would have to store an ABox of quadratic size and do instance checking for it. We refer the reader to Table 3 and its discussion where a prototype implementation of this approach is applied to modules of Snomed CT.\nWe now describe our second approach for computing cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2), which only works for acyclic EL-terminologies. Recall that A \u2208 cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) if, and only if, there exists an EL\u03a3-concept C such that T2 6|= C v A and T1 |= C v A. Thus, we have A 6\u2208 cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) if, and only if, for every EL\u03a3-concept C with C \u2208 noimplyT2,\u03a3(A)\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nit holds that C \u2208 noimplyT1,\u03a3(A). Our approach is now based on computing a \u2018not witness\u2019 relation NW \u2286 ((sig(T1) \u222a \u03a3) \u2229 NC)\u00d7 ((sig(T2) \u222a \u03a3) \u2229 NC), which is defined as follows:\n(E,A) \u2208 NW if, and only if, (\u2020) noimplyT2,\u03a3(A) \u2286 noimplyT1,\u03a3(E)\nObserve that A \u2208 cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) if, and only if, (A,A) 6\u2208 NW; hence, to compute the set cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) it is sufficient to compute the relation NW. In practice, it is crucial to compute the relation NW rather than its complement: in typical terminologies most concept names are unrelated in the sense that they do not subsume each other. Thus, the relation NW is much smaller than its complement (which contains, among others, all pairs (E,A) that do not subsume each other in T1 and T2).\nTo determine the pairs (E,A) \u2208 NW, we aim at computing for every concept name E \u2208 sig(T1) \u222a \u03a3 the set of concept names A \u2208 sig(T2) \u222a \u03a3 for which the property (\u2020) holds. This set will be called NotWitness(E) and is computed in Figure 4, with the following modifications: (1) we only consider those A \u2208 sig(T2) \u222a \u03a3 which are non-conjunctive in T2 and take conjunctive concept names into account later. (2) We consider a fresh concept name All not occurring in \u03a3 \u222a sig(T1) \u222a sig(T2) \u2013 informally standing for \u2018all possible \u03a3concepts\u2019.\nThus, the procedure, NotWitness(E) given in Figure 4 recursively associates with every E \u2208 sig(T1) \u222a \u03a3 a subset of the set\n\u039e = {All} \u222a {A | A \u2208 (sig(T2) \u222a \u03a3), A is non-conjunctive in T2 }\nand NW is a relation over\n((sig(T1) \u222a \u03a3) \u2229 NC)\u00d7 (((sig(T2) \u222a \u03a3) \u2229 NC) \u222a {All}).\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nNote that unlike in the approach for computing cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) that was presented previously, the approach described here does not handle the two terminologies separately. In the previous approach the ABox AT2,\u03a3 could be precomputed for T2 and then be re-used to compare T2 against any other terminology T1, whereas here both terminologies are analysed simultaneously. We now prove the correctness of the procedure NotWitness(E).\nLemma 25. For any normalised acyclic EL-terminologies T1 and T2, any signature \u03a3, any E \u2208 sig(T1) \u222a \u03a3 and any A \u2208 \u039e the following holds: A \u2208 NotWitness(E) if, and only if, (E,A) \u2208 NW.\nProof. We prove that for any E \u2208 sig(T1) \u222a \u03a3 and any A \u2208 \u039e the following two conditions are equivalent:\n\u2022 A \u2208 NotWitness(E);\n\u2022 for all n \u2265 0 and all C \u2208 noimplynT2,\u03a3(A): T1 6|= C v E. This is sufficient since \u22c3 n\u22650 noimply n T2,\u03a3(A) is a cover of noimplyT2,\u03a3(A) (Lemma 19).\nFor E 6\u2208 sig(T1) the claim is trivial. For E \u2208 sig(T1) the proof is by induction relative to the relation T1 \u2286 sig(T1) \u00d7 sig(T1) (whose definition can be found on page 637). Note that since the considered terminologies are acyclic and sig(T1) is finite, the relation T1 is well-founded.\nWe distinguish between the possible definitions of E in T1. Suppose E is pseudoprimitive in T1. For A \u2208 \u039e, it follows from the definition of noimplynT2,\u03a3(A) and from Lemma 15 that there exist n \u2265 0 and C \u2208 noimplynT2,\u03a3(A) such that T1 |= C v E if, and only if, T1 |= B v E for some B \u2208 (\u03a3 \\ pre\u03a3T2(A)). Note that for all B \u2208 (\u03a3 \\ pre \u03a3 T2(A)), T1 6|= B v E holds if, and only if, for every B \u2208 \u03a3, T1 |= B v E implies that B \u2208 pre\u03a3T2(A). Thus, for every n and C \u2208 noimplynT2,\u03a3(A), T1 6|= C v E if, and only if, pre \u03a3 T1(E) \u2286 pre \u03a3 T2(A) if, and only if, A \u2208 NotWitness(E). Assume that E \u2261 E1 u \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 u Ek \u2208 T1. Then, for any concept C, T1 6|= C v E if, and only if, T1 6|= C v Ei for some 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. Hence, by applying the induction hypothesis we obtain for every n and C \u2208 noimplynT2,\u03a3(A), T1 6|= C v E if, and only if, A \u2208 NotWitness(Ei) for some 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, if, and only if, A \u2208 NotWitness(E).\nFinally, assume that E \u2261 \u2203r.E\u2032 \u2208 T1. Notice that, since All /\u2208 (\u03a3 \u222a sig(T1) \u222a sig(T2)) (in particular, All is pseudo-primitive in T2), we have pre\u03a3T2(All) = \u2205. Thus, by definition for every n \u2265 0, noimplynT2,\u03a3(All) = {all n \u03a3}. By applying the induction hypothesis we can assume that the lemma holds for E\u2032, which implies that All /\u2208 NotWitness(E\u2032) if, and only if, for some n \u2265 0, T1 |= alln\u03a3 v E\u2032. We now distinguish between the following cases, analogously to the case distinction in procedure NotWitness(E) (see Figure 4).\nIf r /\u2208 \u03a3, for any \u03a3-concept of the form \u2203s.G, where s \u2208 NR \u2229 \u03a3, we have r 6= s and T1 6|= \u2203s.G v \u2203r.E\u2032. Similarly, if All \u2208 NotWitness(E\u2032), it holds for every n \u2265 0 that T1 6|= alln\u03a3 v E\u2032. Hence, for any \u03a3-concept of the form \u2203s.G, we obtain T1 6|= \u2203s.G v \u2203r.E\u2032 as otherwise T1 |= alln\u03a3 v E\u2032 would hold for n = depth(\u2203s.G) (where depth(\u2203s.G) is the role-depth of \u2203s.G). So, by Lemma 15, these two cases are analogous to the case of E being pseudo-primitive considered above.\nAssume now that r \u2208 \u03a3 and All /\u2208 NotWitness(E\u2032), that is, for some n0 \u2265 0 we have T1 |= alln0\u03a3 v E\u2032.\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nFirst, we observe that if A does not have a definition of the form A \u2261 \u2203r.A\u2032 in T2, then for the unique C \u2208 noimplyn0+1T2,\u03a3 (A) we have T1 |= C v E as \u2203r.all n0 \u03a3 is a conjunct of C (and as A is non-conjunctive in T2 by definition of the set \u039e). IfA has a definition of the formA \u2261 \u2203r.A\u2032 in T2, for any n \u2265 0 and C \u2208 noimplynT2,\u03a3(A), we have by Lemma 15 that T1 6|= C v E if, and only if, pre\u03a3T1(E) \u2286 pre \u03a3 T2(A), and, if n > 0, for every C \u2032 \u2208 noimplyn\u22121T2,\u03a3(A \u2032) we have T1 6|= C \u2032 v A\u2032. We can conclude that in case r \u2208 \u03a3 and All /\u2208 NotWitness(E\u2032), for any A \u2208 \u039e, any n \u2265 0, and any C \u2208 noimplynT2,\u03a3(A), we have T1 6|= C v E, if, and only if, A \u2261 \u2203r.A \u2032 \u2208 T2, pre\u03a3T1(E) \u2286 pre \u03a3 T2(A) and for any m \u2265 0 and any C \u2032 \u2208 noimplymT2,\u03a3(A \u2032) we have\nT1 6|= C \u2032 v E\u2032. Notice further that, by definition for any m \u2265 0, noimplymT2,\u03a3(A \u2032) =\u22c3\nB\u2208non-conjT2 (A \u2032) noimply\nm T2,\u03a3(B). Thus, for any m \u2265 0 and any C \u2032 \u2208 noimplymT2,\u03a3(A \u2032),\nT1 6|= C \u2032 v E\u2032 holds if, and only if, for any m \u2265 0, any B \u2208 non-conjT2(A \u2032) and any C \u2032 \u2208 noimplymT2,\u03a3(B), T1 6|= C \u2032 v E\u2032, if, and only if, for any B \u2208 non-conjT2(A\n\u2032), B \u2208 NotWitness(E\u2032) holds by applying the induction hypothesis.\nThus, T1 6|= C v E, for any n \u2265 0 and C \u2208 noimplynT2,\u03a3(A), if, and only if, A \u2208 NotWitness(E).\nCorollary 26. Let T1 and T2 be normalised acyclic EL-terminologies and \u03a3 a signature. Then cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) = {A \u2208 sig(T1) \u2229 \u03a3 | \u2203B \u2208 non-conjT2(A) with B 6\u2208 NotWitness(A) }.\nProof. First, we observe that if A \u2208 cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2), A \u2208 sig(T1) must hold as otherwise for any \u03a3-concept C we have T1 |= C v A if, and only if, |= C v A, and thus A 6\u2208 cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2). Now, for all A \u2208 NC we have:\nA \u2208 cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) iff A \u2208 sig(T1) \u2229 \u03a3 (by our observation) and, by definition, there exists a \u03a3-concept C with T2 6|= C v A and T1 |= C v A\niff A \u2208 sig(T1) \u2229 \u03a3 and there exists B \u2208 non-conjT2(A) and a \u03a3-concept C with T2 6|= C v B and T1 |= C v A (as otherwise T2 |= C v A would hold) iff A \u2208 sig(T1) \u2229 \u03a3 and there exists B \u2208 non-conjT2(A) with (A,B) 6\u2208 NW (by definition of the relation NW) iff A \u2208 sig(T1) \u2229 \u03a3 and there exists B \u2208 non-conjT2(A) with B 6\u2208 NotWitness(A), by Lemma 25.\nFor acyclic terminologies, we now obtain an alternative proof of Theorem 24.\nTheorem 27. For acyclic EL-terminologies T1 and T2 and a signature \u03a3, cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) can be computed in polynomial time using the procedure NotWitness(E).\nProof. To compute the set cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2), it is sufficient by Corollary 26 to compute the sets NotWitness(E) for every E \u2208 sig(T1). Assuming that T1 and T2 are classified and the result of classification is cached, NotWitness(E) can be computed for all E \u2208 sig(T1), in the worst case, in time O((|T1|+ |T2|)3).\nExample 28. For the acyclic terminologies T1, T2 and the signature \u03a3 from Example 23,\nNotWitness(A0) = {A0}, NotWitness(B0) = {A0}\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nand for all other concept names X \u2208 sig(T1), NotWitness(X) = \u2205. In particular A1 /\u2208 NotWitness(A1), so we conclude that A1 is a concept difference witness.\n4.3 Computing cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2)\nRecall that the set of left-hand \u03a3-concept difference witnesses, cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2), is the set of all A \u2208 \u03a3 \u2229 NC such that there exists a concept C with A v C \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2). The tractability of computing cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) for EL has been proved by Lutz and Wolter (2010) for arbitrary EL-TBoxes by reduction to simulation checking. Here we formulate the main steps again because we employ the same technique when dealing with the logical difference for ELHr-terminologies.\nFor any two interpretations I1 and I2 we say that a relation S between I1 and I2 is a \u03a3-simulation if, and only if, the following conditions hold:\n\u2022 if (d, e) \u2208 S and d \u2208 AI1 with A \u2208 \u03a3, then e \u2208 AI2 ;\n\u2022 if (d, e) \u2208 S and (d, d\u2032) \u2208 rI1 with r \u2208 \u03a3, then there exists e\u2032 with (d\u2032, e\u2032) \u2208 S and (e, e\u2032) \u2208 rI2 .\nFor d \u2208 \u2206I1 and e \u2208 \u2206I2 we write (I1, d) \u2264\u03a3 (I2, e) if there exists a \u03a3-simulation relation S between I1 and I2 such that (d, e) \u2208 S. It can be checked in polynomial time whether (I1, d) \u2264\u03a3 (I2, e) and various polynomial-time algorithms checking the existence of simulations have been developed (Clarke & Schlingloff, 2001; Crafa, Ranzato, & Tapparo, 2011; van Glabbeek & Ploeger, 2008). Simulations characterise the expressive power of EL-concepts in the following sense.\nLemma 29 (Lutz & Wolter, 2010). Let I1 and I2 be interpretations, \u03a3 a signature, d \u2208 \u2206I1, and e \u2208 \u2206I2. Then\n(I1, d) \u2264\u03a3 (I2, e) \u21d4 for all EL\u03a3-concepts C: d \u2208 CI1 \u21d2 e \u2208 CI2 .\nIt follows that for any A \u2208 \u03a3, we have\nA \u2208 cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) \u21d4 (IK1 , a) 6\u2264\u03a3 (IK2 , a)\nwhere Ki = (Ti,A) for A = {A(a)} and IKi is the canonical model for Ki, i = 1, 2. To see this, recall that by Theorem 2 for every EL-concept C, a \u2208 CIKi if, and only if, (Ti,A) |= C(a). The latter condition is equivalent to Ti |= A v C. We have, therefore, proved:\nTheorem 30 (Lutz & Wolter, 2010). For EL-TBoxes T1 and T2 and signatures \u03a3, the set cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) can be computed in polynomial time.\nThe following example illustrates the use of simulations between canonical models to determine cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2).\nExample 31. Let \u03a3 = {A, r,B1, B2} and\nT1 = {A v \u2203r.F0, F0 v F1 u F2, F1 v \u2203r.B1, F2 v \u2203r.B2}, T2 = {A v G1 uG2, G1 v \u2203r.G\u20321, G2 v \u2203r.G\u20322, G\u20321 v \u2203r.B1, G\u20322 v \u2203r.B2}\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nTo check whether A \u2208 cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) consider the KBs K1 = (T1, {A(a)}) and K2 = (T2, {A(a)}). Then A \u2208 cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) iff (IK1 , a) 6\u2264\u03a3 (IK2 , a), for the canonical models IK1 and IK2 of K1 and K2, respectively. Illustrations of the canonical models IK1 and IK2 are shown below.\nIK1 A a\nxran(r),F0\nxran(r),B1 B1\nxran(r),B2 B2\nr\nr r\nIK2A a\nxran(r),G\u20321 xran(r),G\u20322\nxran(r),B1 B1\nxran(r),B2 B2\nrr\nr r\nBut (IK1 , a) 6\u2264\u03a3 (IK2 , a) because the point xran(r),F0 is neither \u03a3-simulated by xran(r),G\u20321 nor \u03a3-simulated by xran(r),G\u20322 . A concept inclusion in cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) with A on the left-hand side is given by A v \u2203r.((\u2203r.B1) u (\u2203r.B2)).\n5. ELHr-Instance Difference\nOur polynomial-time algorithms for inseparability and logical difference in ELHr are based on extensions of the ideas used in Section 4 for EL. There is, however, one important difference: we introduce new logics, ELran and ELran,u,u, for which the concept difference captures exactly the instance and, respectively, query difference in ELHr. To prove an analogue of Theorem 16 for those languages and, thereby, for the instance and query difference for ELHr, we introduce a sequent calculus which characterises all ELran-consequences of ELHr-terminologies. We start our investigation with the instance difference case since it is more transparent than the concept difference case (recall that for EL there is no difference between the instance and the concept difference).\n5.1 ELran-Concept Difference\nRecall Example 4 showing that ELHr \u03a3-concept inseparability does not imply \u03a3-instance inseparability:\nT1 = {ran(r) v A1, ran(s) v A2, B \u2261 A1 uA2}, T2 = \u2205, \u03a3 = {r, s, B}.\nNotice that for the ABox A = {r(a, c), s(b, c)}, exhibiting the instance difference between T1 and T2, c is in the range of both r and s. This example suggests that if ran(r) and ran(s) could be used in complex concepts, this kind of difference can be made visible for a concept language.\nDefinition 32 (ELran). Cran-concepts are constructed using the following syntax rule\nC := A | ran(r) | C uD | \u2203r.C,\nwhere A \u2208 NC, C,D range over Cran-concepts and r \u2208 NR. The set of ELran-inclusions consists of all concept inclusions C v D and role inclusions r v s, where C is a Cranconcept, D an EL-concept, and r, s \u2208 NR.\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nClearly, every ELHr-inclusion is an ELran-inclusion. Additionally, in ELran-inclusions the concept ran(r) can occur everywhere in concepts on the left-hand side of inclusions. This gives us additional concept inclusions for the \u03a3-concept difference.\nExample 33. For T1 and T2 from Example 4, we have T1 |= ran(r) u ran(s) v B, but T2 6|= ran(r) u ran(s) v B. Thus, using the Cran-concept ran(r) u ran(s) we can simulate the ABox {r(a, c), s(b, c)} from Example 4 and make the \u03a3-difference that could not be observed in ELHr visible in ELran.\nWe now show that Example 33 can be generalised to arbitrary TBoxes. To this end, we consider the following straightforward generalisation of the \u03a3-concept difference to differences over ELran.\nDefinition 34 (ELran\u03a3 -difference). The ELran\u03a3 -difference between ELHr-TBoxes T1 and T2 is the set cDiffran\u03a3 (T1, T2) of all ELran\u03a3 -inclusions \u03b1 such that T1 |= \u03b1 and T2 6|= \u03b1.\nTo prove the equivalence between \u03a3-instance difference in ELHr and \u03a3-concept difference in ELran, we first associate with every ABox A and individual a in A a set CranA,a of Cran-concepts. Assume A is given. Let, inductively, for a \u2208 obj(A):\nC0,ranA,a = ( l\nA(a)\u2208A\nA) u ( l\nr(b,a)\u2208A\nran(r));\nand Cn+1,ranA,a = ( l\nA(a)\u2208A\nA) u ( l\nr(b,a)\u2208A\nran(r)) u ( l\nr(a,b)\u2208A\n\u2203r.Cn,ranA,b ),\nand set CranA,a = {C n,ran A,a | n \u2265 0}\nObserve that A |= Cn,ranA,a (a) for all n > 0. Moreover, the lemma below shows that, intuitively, the infinite conjunction d CranA,a is the most specific \u201cconcept\u201d with A |= d CranA,a(a).\nConversely, we associate an ABox with a Cran-concept. The construction is straightforward; however, some care has to be taken since we do not introduce structure sharing but associate distinct individual names with distinct occurrences of subconcepts. Given a Cran-concept C, we first define a path in C as a finite sequence C0 \u00b7 r1 \u00b7 C1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 rn \u00b7 Cn, where C0 = C, n \u2265 0, and \u2203ri+1.Ci+1 is a conjunct of Ci, for 0 \u2264 i < n. We use paths(C) to denote the set of all paths in C. If p \u2208 paths(C), then tail(p) denotes the last element Cn in p.\nNow, let aran and ap for p \u2208 paths(C) be individual names and set inductively:\nAC = { s(ap, aq) | p, q \u2208 paths(C); q = p \u00b7 s \u00b7 C \u2032, for some C \u2032 } \u222a {A(ap) | A is a conjunct of tail(p), p \u2208 paths(C) } \u222a {>(ap) | > is a conjunct of tail(p), p \u2208 paths(C) } \u222a { r(aran, ap) | ran(r) is a conjunct of tail(p), p \u2208 paths(C) }\nExample 35. Let C = (\u2203r.(A u ran(v))) u (\u2203s.((\u2203t.(A u ran(v))) u (\u2203t.(B u ran(s))))) be a Cran-concept. Then AC can be represented graphically as follows.\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\naC\nA\naran\nA B\nsr\nt t\nv\nv\ns\nWe only indicate aC and aran; other individuals are identified by paths in C. Note that different occurrences of A u ran(v) in C correspond to different individuals in AC .\nLemma 36. Let T be an ELHr-TBox, A be an ABox, C0 and D0 be Cran-concepts, and let a0 \u2208 obj(A). Then\n\u2022 (T ,A) |= D0(a0) if, and only if, there exists n \u2265 0 such that T |= Cn,ranA,a0 v D0;\n\u2022 T |= C0 v D0 if, and only if, (T ,AC0) |= D0(aC0).\nBelow, we will employ this lemma to transfer an analogue of Theorem 16 for ELran to ELHr-instance differences. For now, we only note the following consequence:\nCorollary 37. For any two ELHr-TBoxes T1 and T2, cDiffran\u03a3 (T1, T2) = \u2205 if, and only if, iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) = \u2205.\nProof. If (A, D0(a0)) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2), then there exists an n \u2265 0 such that Cn,ranA,a0 v D0 \u2208 cDiffran\u03a3 (T1, T2). Conversely, if C0 v D0 \u2208 cDiffran\u03a3 (T1, T2), then (AC0 , D0(aC0)) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2).\nNote that Theorem 6 follows from Corollary 37 since for any ELHr-TBox T without range restrictions T |= C v D if, and only if, T |= C \u2032 v D, where C \u2032 is obtained from C by replacing any concept of the form ran(r) in C by >.\n5.2 Proof System for ELHr\nThe Gentzen-style proof system for ELHr consists of the rules given in Figures 1 and 5. Cut elimination, correctness, and completeness of the proof system can be shown similarly to the corresponding proofs given by Hofmann (2005).\nTheorem 38. For all ELHr-terminologies T and Cran-concepts C and D, it holds that T |= C v D if, and only if, T ` C v D.\nWe now generalise Lemma 15 to ELHr-terminologies.\nLemma 39. Let T be an ELHr-terminology, A a concept name and \u2203r.D an EL-concept. Assume\nT |= l\n1\u2264i\u2264l ran(si) u\nl\n1\u2264j\u2264n Aj u\nl\n1\u2264k\u2264m \u2203rk.Ck v \u2203r.D,\nwhere Ck, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m, are Cran-concepts and l,m, n \u2265 0. Then at least one of the following conditions holds:\n(e1) there exists rk, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m, such that T |= rk v r and T |= Ck u ran(rk) v D; (e2) there exists Aj, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, such that T |= Aj v \u2203r.D; (e3) there exists rk, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m, such that T |= \u2203rk.> v \u2203r.D; (e4) there exists si, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l, such that T |= ran(si) v \u2203r.D.\nNow assume that A is pseudo-primitive and\nT |= l\n1\u2264i\u2264l ran(si) u\nl\n1\u2264j\u2264n Aj u\nl\n1\u2264k\u2264m \u2203rk.Ck v A,\nwhere Ck, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m, are Cran-concepts and l,m, n \u2265 0. Then at least one of the following conditions holds:\n(a1) there exists Aj, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n such that T |= Aj v A; (a2) there exists rk, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m such that T |= \u2203rk.> v A; (a3) there exists si, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l such that T |= ran(si) v A.\nProof. We prove the first part of the lemma, the second part can then be proved analogously.\nLet C = d 1\u2264i\u2264l ran(si) u d 1\u2264j\u2264nAj u d\n1\u2264k\u2264m \u2203rk.Ck and assume that T |= C v \u2203r.D holds. Then, we have T ` C v \u2203r.D by Theorem 38, which implies that there exists a derivation D of the sequent C v \u2203r.D. The proof now proceeds by induction on the depth of D, i.e. the maximal length of any path from the root to one of the leaves of D.\nNotice that if l + n + m \u2265 2, the root of D can only have been derived by AndL1 or AndL2. The lemma follows then from the induction hypothesis.\nOtherwise, we have l + n + m = 1. Note that l + m + n = 0 is not possible since T 6|= > v \u2203r.D by definition of the terminology T . If C = A1 or C = ran(s1), then (e2) or (e4), respectively, hold already. It remains to consider the case where C = \u2203r1.C1. Then, the rule used to derive the root of D can only have been one of Ax, Ex, ExRan, Dom or Sub. We consider those cases one by one:\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\n\u2022 the root of D was derived with Ax: then by considering the form of the inference rule, r1 = r and C1 = D. Hence T |= r1 v r and T |= C1 u ran(r1) v D, which implies that (e1) holds.\n\u2022 the root of D was derived with Ex: then r1 = r and T ` C1 v D. Hence, T |= r1 v r and T |= C1 v D holds by Theorem 38. Thus, T |= C1 u ran(r1) v D and we can infer that (e1) holds again.\n\u2022 the root of D was derived with Dom: we have T ` B v \u2203r.D and \u2203r1.> v B \u2208 T . Then by Theorem 38, T |= B v \u2203r.D and hence, T |= \u2203r1.> v \u2203r.D, that is, (e3) holds.\n\u2022 the root of D was derived with ExRan: we obtain T ` \u2203r1.(C1 u ran(r1)) v \u2203r.D. Since the sequent \u2203r1.(C1 u ran(r1)) v \u2203r.D has a derivation that is of shorter length than D, we can apply the induction hypothesis. Hence, either T |= \u2203r1.> v \u2203r.D, that is, (e3) holds, or T |= r1 v r and T |= (C1 u ran(r1))u ran(r1) v D. Hence (e1) holds as |= C1 u ran(r1) v (C1 u ran(r1)) u ran(r1).\n\u2022 the root of D was derived with Sub: we obtain T ` \u2203s.C1 v \u2203r.D and r1 v s \u2208 T . By the induction hypothesis, either T |= \u2203s.> v \u2203r.D, or T |= s v r and T |= C1 u ran(s) v D. It can be seen that T |= \u2203r1.> v \u2203r.D, or T |= r1 v r and T |= C1 u ran(r1) v D, respectively. Hence (e3) or (e1) holds.\nWe now prove an extension of Theorem 16 to ELran-consequences of ELHr-terminologies. We give a rather detailed description of the simple witness inclusions contained in members of cDiffran\u03a3 (T1, T2) since we are going to use this result again when analysing the concept difference in ELHr.\nTheorem 40 (Primitive witness for ELran-differences). Let T1 and T2 be ELHr-terminologies and \u03a3 a signature. If \u03d5 \u2208 cDiffran\u03a3 (T1, T2), then either there exist {r, s} \u2286 sig(\u03d5) with r v s \u2208 cDiffran\u03a3 (T1, T2) or \u03d5 is of the form C v D, and one of\n1. C \u2032 v A or ran(r) u C \u2032 v A,\n2. A v D\u2032, \u2203r.> v D\u2032 or ran(r) v D\u2032\nis a member of cDiffran\u03a3 (T1, T2), where r \u2208 sig(\u03d5), A \u2208 sig(\u03d5) is a concept name, C \u2032 is a subconcept of C and D\u2032 is a subconcept of D.\nProof. Let C v D \u2208 cDiffran\u03a3 (T1, T2), where C is a Cran-concept and D an EL-concept. We prove the theorem by induction on the structure of D.\nNotice that D 6= > as T2 |= C v >. If D is a concept name, then an inclusion from Point 1 exists. If D = D1 u D2, then one of C v Di, i = 1, 2, is in cDiffran\u03a3 (T1, T2). We can apply the induction hypothesis and we can infer that an inclusion from Point 1 or Point 2 exists. If D = \u2203r.D1, let C = d 1\u2264i\u2264l ran(si) u d 1\u2264j\u2264nAj u d 1\u2264k\u2264m \u2203rk.Ck. Then, by Lemma 39, one of (e1)\u2013(e4) holds. Cases (e2)\u2013(e4) directly entail that an inclusion from Point 1 or Point 2 exists. In case of (e1), either rk v r \u2208 cDiffran\u03a3 (T1, T2)\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nor T1 |= Ck u ran(rk) v D1 but T2 6|= Ck u ran(rk) v D1 (as otherwise T2 |= C v D would hold). Now we can apply the induction hypothesis to D1 and conclude that an inclusion from Point 1 or Point 2 exists."}, {"heading": "5.3 Instance Difference Witnesses", "text": "Similarly to Theorem 16 for the concept difference between EL-terminologies and derived from its extension, Theorem 40, for ELran, we show that every member (A, \u03b1) of iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) gives rise to a basic witness in which either the ABox or the instance query are atomic. To keep the formulation succinct we give an abstract description of the relationship between (A, \u03b1) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) and its witness using only the signature of (A, \u03b1). The interested reader will have no problem to derive a stronger relationship between (A, \u03b1) and its witness from the proof.\nTheorem 41 (Primitive witness for ELHr-instance differences). Let T1 and T2 be ELHrterminologies and \u03a3 a signature. If \u03d5 \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2), then at least one of the following conditions holds:\n1. ({r(a, b)}, s(a, b)) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2), for some r, s \u2208 sig(\u03d5);\n2. (A, A(b)) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2), for some concept name A \u2208 sig(\u03d5), individual b, and ABox A with sig(A) \u2286 sig(\u03d5).\n3. (A, D(b)) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2), for some singleton ABox A, individual b in A, and ELconcept D such that sig(A), sig(D) \u2286 sig(\u03d5);\nProof. Let (A, \u03b1) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2). We distinguish the following cases. (a) If \u03b1 = s(a, b), then (T1,A) |= s(a, b) if, and only if, for some r(a, b) \u2208 A we have T1 |= r v s. As (T2,A) 6|= s(a, b) we obtain T2 6|= r v s. Thus, ({r(a, b)}, s(a, b)) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) and Point 1 holds.\n(b) Assume \u03b1 = D(b) for some EL-concept D. By Lemma 36, for some n \u2265 0 we have T1 |= Cn,ranA,b v D and T2 6|= C n,ran A,b v D. By Theorem 40, one of (i) r v s, (ii) A v D\n\u2032, (iii) \u2203r.> v D\u2032, (iv) ran(r) v D\u2032, (v) C v A, or (vi) ran(r)uC v A is a member of cDiffran\u03a3 (T1, T2), where r \u2208 sig(\u03d5), A \u2208 sig(\u03d5) is a concept name, C is a subconcept of Cn,ranA,b and D\n\u2032 is a subconcept of D. If (i) r v s \u2208 cDiffran\u03a3 (T1, T2), then ({r(a, b)}, s(a, b)) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) and Point 1 holds.\nNow let F v G denote the member of cDiffran\u03a3 (T1, T2) in the cases (ii)-(vi) above. Consider the ABox AF associated with the Cran-concept F in Point 2 of Lemma 36. Then sig(AF ) \u2286 sig(\u03d5) and (AF , G(aF )) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2).\nIn case (ii), we obtain that F = A is a concept name. Hence AF = {A(aF )} and Point 3 holds. For case (iii), we obtain AF = {r(aF , a>),>(a>)} and Point 3 of the lemma applies again (after removing >(a>) from AF ). Similarly, if (iv), then AF = {r(aran, aF )}, and Point 3 of the lemma holds. Finally, for the cases (v) and (vi), G \u2208 sig(\u03d5) is a concept name. Hence Point 2 of the lemma applies.\nTheorem 41 justifies the following finite representation of the \u03a3-instance difference between ELHr-terminologies. It corresponds exactly to the three distinct points of the theorem. Assume T1 and T2 are given. Let\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\n\u2022 the set of role \u03a3-instance difference witnesses, iWtnR\u03a3(T1, T2), consist of all r v s such that T1 |= r v s and T2 6|= r v s;\n\u2022 the set of right-hand \u03a3-instance difference witnesses, iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2), consist of all A \u2208 \u03a3 such that there exists A with (A, A(a)) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2);\n\u2022 the set of left-hand \u03a3-instance difference witnesses, iWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2), consist of all A \u2208 \u03a3 such that there exists C(a) with ({A(a)}, C(a)) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) and all r \u2208 \u03a3 such that there exists C(c) with c = a or c = b such that ({r(a, b)}, C(c)) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2).\nThe set of all \u03a3-instance difference witnesses is defined as\niWtn\u03a3(T1, T2) = (iWtnR\u03a3(T1, T2), iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2), iWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2)).\nBy Theorem 41, observe that iWtn\u03a3(T1, T2) = (\u2205, \u2205, \u2205) if, and only if, iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) = \u2205. The set iWtnR\u03a3(T1, T2) can be easily computed in polynomial time and will not be analysed further in this paper. Thus, our aim now is to present polynomial-time algorithms computing iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) and iWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2).\n5.4 Computing iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2)\nWe compute iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) in two different ways: first, we present the more transparent ABox approach that works for arbitrary ELHr-terminologies, and second we present the more efficient dynamic programming approach that works for acyclic ELHr-terminologies only. Both approaches have been introduced in Section 4.2 for EL-terminologies. We start with the ABox approach and exhibit a \u03a3-ABox AT2,\u03a3 depending on T2 and \u03a3 only such that for non-conjunctive A \u2208 \u03a3 there exists an ABox A such that (A, A(d)) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) if, and only if, (T1,AT2,\u03a3) |= A(\u03beA) for a certain individual name \u03beA. The case of conjunctive A is reduced to this condition for its defining concept names.\nTo deal with ELHr-terminologies rather than with EL-terminologies we have to extend the structure of AT2,\u03a3 significantly. To describe the model-theoretic properties of AT2,\u03a3, we require the notion of a \u03a3-range simulation. They capture model-theoretically the expressive power of Cran-concepts (the concepts that have been used to describe the \u03a3-instance difference in terms of subsumption, cf. Lemma 36). For any two ABoxes A1,A2 with designated individual names a1 and a2, we say that a relation S between obj(A1) and obj(A2) is a \u03a3-simulation if, and only if,\n(S1) (a1, a2) \u2208 S;\n(S2) for all A \u2208 \u03a3: if (a, b) \u2208 S and A(a) \u2208 A1, then A(b) \u2208 A2;\n(S3) for all r \u2208 \u03a3: if (a, b) \u2208 S and r(a, a\u2032) \u2208 A1, then there exists b\u2032 with (a\u2032, b\u2032) \u2208 S and r(b, b\u2032) \u2208 A2.\nWe say that S is a \u03a3-range simulation if, in addition,\n(RS) for all r \u2208 \u03a3: if (a, b) \u2208 S and there exists c such that r(c, a) \u2208 A1, then there exists c\u2032 with r(c\u2032, b) \u2208 A2.\nIn what follows we write\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\n\u2022 (A1, a1) \u2264\u03a3 (A2, a2) if there exists a \u03a3-simulation between (A1, a1) and (A2, a2); and\n\u2022 (A1, a1) \u2264ran\u03a3 (A2, a2) if there exists a \u03a3-range simulation between (A1, a1) and (A2, a2).\nThe following lemma shows that range simulations characterise Cran-concepts.\nLemma 42. Let A1 and A2 be \u03a3-ABoxes with designated individual names a1 and a2. If (A1, a1) \u2264ran\u03a3 (A2, a2), then (T ,A1) |= C(a1) implies (T ,A2) |= C(a2) for all Cran-concepts C.\nProof. We apply Lemma 36. Let S be a \u03a3-range simulation between A1 and A2 with (a1, a2) \u2208 S. One can prove by induction on n that for all n \u2265 0, for all a \u2208 obj(A1) and for all b \u2208 obj(A2),\n(\u2217) If (a, b) \u2208 S, then A2 |= Cn,ranA1,a (b).\nNow assume that (A1, a1) \u2264ran\u03a3 (A2, a2) and that (T ,A1) |= C(a1) holds for a Cranconcept C. Then, by Lemma 36, there exists n \u2265 0 such that T |= Cn,ranA1,a1 v C. Moreover, as (A1, a1) \u2264ran\u03a3 (A2, a2), we have by (\u2217) that A2 |= C n,ran A1,a1(a2), which then implies that (T ,A2) |= C(a2), as required.\nThe construction of AT ,\u03a3 is now given in Figure 6, where T is a normalised ELHrterminology and \u03a3 a signature. We advise the reader to recall the definition of AT ,\u03a3 given in Figure 3 for EL-terminologies T and then consider the additional ingredients required for ELHr-terminologies. We remind the reader of the definition of non-conjT (A) from Section 4.2:\nnon-conjT (A) = { {A}, A is non-conjunctive in T {B1, . . . , Bn}, A \u2261 B1 u \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 uBn \u2208 T\nIn Figure 6, we also use the following sets, for A \u2208 NC and r \u2208 NR:\n\u2022 preC\u03a3T (A) = {B \u2208 \u03a3 \u2229 NC | T |= B v A },\n\u2022 preDom\u03a3T (A) = { r \u2208 \u03a3 \u2229 NR | T |= \u2203r.> v A },\n\u2022 preRan\u03a3T (A) = { r \u2208 \u03a3 \u2229 NR | T |= ran(r) v A },\n\u2022 preRole\u03a3T (r) = { s \u2208 \u03a3 \u2229 NR | T |= s v r }.\nThe following example illustrates the definition of AT ,\u03a3.\nExample 43. For T1 = {ran(r) v A1, ran(s) v A2, B \u2261 A1uA2}, T2 = \u2205, and \u03a3 = {r, s, B} defined as in Example 4, we have\nAT2,\u03a3 = {B(\u03be\u03a3), r(\u03be\u03a3, \u03be\u03a3), s(\u03be\u03a3, \u03be\u03a3), r(\u03beB, \u03be\u03a3), s(\u03beB, \u03be\u03a3), r(\u03be\u03a3, \u03beB), s(\u03be\u03a3, \u03beB)}.\nIt holds that (T1,AT2,\u03a3) |= B(\u03beB) and (T2,AT2,\u03a3) 6|= B(\u03beB).\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nLemma 44. For every normalised ELHr-terminology T and signature \u03a3 the following conditions are equivalent for all \u03a3-ABoxes A, A \u2208 sig(T ) \u222a \u03a3 non-conjunctive in T , and all a \u2208 obj(A):\n1. (T ,A) 6|= A(a);\n2. \u03beA \u2208 obj(AT ,\u03a3) and (A, a) \u2264ran\u03a3 (AT ,\u03a3, \u03beA).\nLemma 44 is proved in the appendix.\nLemma 45. Let T1 and T2 be normalised ELHr-terminologies, \u03a3 a signature and A \u2208 \u03a3. Let AT2,\u03a3 be the ABox constructed in Figure 6. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n\u2022 there exists a \u03a3-ABox A such that (T1,A) |= A(a) and (T2,A) 6|= A(a);\n\u2022 (T1,AT2,\u03a3) |= A(\u03beB) for some B \u2208 non-conjT2(A).\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nProof. Assume there exists a \u03a3-ABox A and a \u2208 obj(A) with (T1,A) |= A(a) and (T2,A) 6|= A(a). Then, as (T2,A) 6|= A(a), for some B \u2208 non-conjT2(A), (T2,A) 6|= B(a). Hence, by Lemma 44, (A, a) \u2264ran\u03a3 (AT2,\u03a3, \u03beB). But then, by Lemma 42, (T1,AT2,\u03a3) |= A(\u03beB), as required.\nConversely, suppose that (T1,AT2,\u03a3) |= A(\u03beB) for some B \u2208 non-conjT2(A) with \u03beB \u2208 obj(AT2,\u03a3). Notice that, by Lemma 44, (T2,AT2,\u03a3) 6|= B(\u03beB). Hence (T2,AT2,\u03a3) 6|= A(\u03beB) and so AT2,\u03a3 and \u03beB witness Point 1.\nTheorem 46. Let T1 and T2 be normalised ELHr-terminologies and \u03a3 a signature. Then iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) can be computed in polynomial time.\nProof. By Lemma 45, A \u2208 iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) if, and only if, for some B \u2208 non-conjT2(A) we have (T1,AT2,\u03a3) |= A(\u03beB). It remains to observe that AT2,\u03a3 can be constructed in polynomial time and checking whether (T1,AT2,\u03a3) |= A(\u03beB) is in polynomial time.\nWe now briefly describe how the dynamic programming approach for computing the set iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) for acyclic terminologies is extended from EL to ELHr. The extension of the NotWitness(E) algorithm from Figure 4 to ELHr is given in Figure 7. As in Figure 4, the procedure NotWitness(E) recursively associates with every E \u2208 sig(T1) \u222a \u03a3 a subset of\n\u039e = {All} \u222a {A | A \u2208 (sig(T2) \u222a \u03a3), A is non-conjunctive in T2 }.\nThe conditions for A \u2208 NotWitness(E) become more complex since now one has to take into account the sets preRan\u03a3T (E) and preDom \u03a3 T (E). To prove the correctness of the NotWitness algorithm, we observe the following consequence of Lemma 36.\nCorollary 47. Let T1 and T2 be normalised acyclic ELHr-terminologies and \u03a3 a signature. Then iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) = {A \u2208 \u03a3 | \u2203 Cran-concept C such that C v A \u2208 cDiffran\u03a3 (T1, T2) }.\nProof. First, let A \u2208 iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2). Then there exists a \u03a3-ABox A such that (T1,A) |= A(a) and (T2,A) 6|= A(a). Hence, by Point 1 of Lemma 36 there exists n \u2265 0 such that Cn,ranA,a v A \u2208 cDiff ran \u03a3 (T1, T2). Note that C n,ran A,a is a Cran-concept. Conversely, assume A \u2208 \u03a3 such that there exists a Cran-concept C with C v A \u2208 cDiffran\u03a3 (T1, T2). Then by Point 2 of Lemma 36, (AC , A(aC)) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2), i.e. A \u2208 iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2).\nWe now formulate the correctness of the NotWitness algorithm in the same way as in Corollary 26.\nTheorem 48. Let T1 and T2 be normalised acyclic ELHr-terminologies and \u03a3 a signature. Then iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) = {A \u2208 sig(T1) \u2229 \u03a3 | \u2203B \u2208 non-conjT2(A) with B 6\u2208 NotWitness(A) }.\nThe proof is an extension of the proofs of Lemma 25 and Corollary 26. Namely, one can show that for all A \u2208 sig(T1) \u222a \u03a3 and all B \u2208 sig(T2) \u222a \u03a3 such that B is non-conjunctive in T2 the following conditions are equivalent:\n\u2022 B \u2208 NotWitness(A);\n\u2022 for all Cran\u03a3 -concepts C: T2 6|= C v B implies T1 6|= C v A.\nUsing Corollary 47, we thus obtain for every A \u2208 \u03a3: A \u2208 iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) if, and only if, there exists a Cran\u03a3 -concept C with T2 6|= C v A and T1 |= C v A if, and only if, there exists B \u2208 non-conjT2(A) with B 6\u2208 NotWitness(A).\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\n5.5 Tractability of iWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2)\nWe prove the tractability of iWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) by the same reduction to simulation checking as in the case of EL-terminologies (Theorem 30).\nTheorem 49. Let T1 and T2 be ELHr-TBoxes and let \u03a3 be a signature. Then the set iWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) can be computed in polynomial time.\nProof. For any concept name A \u2208 \u03a3 we have\nA \u2208 iWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) \u21d4 (IK1 , a) 6\u2264\u03a3 (IK2 , a)\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nwhere Ki = (Ti,A) for A = {A(a)} and IKi is the canonical model for Ki, i = 1, 2. Indeed, ({A(a)}, C(a)) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2), for some EL\u03a3-concept C, if, and only if, by Theorem 2, a \u2208 CIK1 and a /\u2208 CIK2 . But this condition is, by Lemma 29, equivalent to (IK1 , a) 6\u2264\u03a3 (IK2 , a). The latter condition can be checked in polynomial time.\nSimilarly, for any role name r \u2208 \u03a3 we have\nr \u2208 iWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) \u21d4 (IK1 , a) 6\u2264\u03a3 (IK2 , a) or (IK1 , b) 6\u2264\u03a3 (IK2 , b)\nwhere Ki = (Ti,A), A = {r(a, b)}, and IKi is the canonical model for Ki, i = 1, 2. Again, the latter condition can be checked in polynomial time.\n6. ELHr-Concept Difference\nIn this section we present polynomial-time algorithms deciding \u03a3-concept inseparability and computing a succinct representation of the concept difference between ELHr-terminologies. The algorithms are essentially by reduction to the instance difference case.\nWe start by introducing the succinct representation of the \u03a3-concept difference. Let T1 and T2 be ELHr-terminologies. Since cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) \u2286 cDiffran\u03a3 (T1, T2), it follows from Theorem 40 for C v D \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) that there exists an inclusion of at least one of the following forms\n(i) C \u2032 v A, (ii) ran(r) u C \u2032 v A, (iii) A v D\u2032, (iv) \u2203r.> v D\u2032, or (v) ran(r) v D\u2032\nin cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2), where r \u2208 sig(\u03d5), A \u2208 sig(\u03d5) is a concept name, C \u2032 is a subconcept of C and D\u2032 is a subconcept of D. Notice in particular for case (ii) that C \u2032 is an EL-concept. Hence, just as in the case of the \u03a3-instance difference, we obtain the following representation of the \u03a3-concept difference. Assume T1 and T2 are given. Let\n\u2022 the set of role inclusion \u03a3-concept difference witnesses, cWtnR\u03a3(T1, T2), consist of all r v s such that T1 |= r v s and T2 6|= r v s;\n\u2022 the set of right-hand \u03a3-concept difference witnesses, cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2), consist of all A \u2208 \u03a3 such that there exists an EL-concept C with either C v A \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) or there additionally exists a role name r \u2208 \u03a3 such that ran(r)uC v A \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2).\n\u2022 the set of left-hand \u03a3-concept difference witnesses, cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2), consist of all A \u2208 \u03a3 such that there exists an EL-concept C with A v C \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2), and of all role names r \u2208 \u03a3 such that there exists an EL-concept C with either \u2203r.> v C \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) or ran(r) v C \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2).\nThe set of all \u03a3-concept difference witnesses is defined as\ncWtn\u03a3(T1, T2) = (cWtnR\u03a3(T1, T2), cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2), cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2)).\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nObserve that cWtn\u03a3(T1, T2) = (\u2205, \u2205, \u2205) if, and only if, cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) = \u2205. We also obtain that the sets cWtnR\u03a3(T1, T2) and cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) coincide with the corresponding witness sets for the instance difference, which allows us to re-use some results that we have developed for detecting instance differences.\nLemma 50. Let T1 and T2 be normalised ELHr-terminologies and \u03a3 a signature. Then the following holds:\n1. cWtnR\u03a3(T1, T2) = iWtnR\u03a3(T1, T2),\n2. cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) = iWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2)\n3. cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) \u2286 iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2)\nProof. Point 1 follows directly from the definition. Proving cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) \u2286 iWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) and cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) \u2286 iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) is similar to Lemma 10. Finally, to prove that iWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) \u2286 cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2), assume that A \u2208 iWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2). Then there exists an ELconcept D(a) with ({A(a)}, D(a)) \u2208 iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2). But then T1 |= A v D and T2 6|= A v D and, therefore, A \u2208 cWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2). The argument for r \u2208 iWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) is similar.\nWe have presented polynomial-time algorithms which can compute iWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) and iWtnR\u03a3(T1, T2). Thus, it remains to analyse cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2).\n6.1 Tractability of cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2)\nWe prove tractability of cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) by modifying the ABox AT2,\u03a3 that has been introduced to prove tractability of iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2). Recall thatA \u2208 iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) iff (T1,AT2,\u03a3) |= A(\u03beB) for some B \u2208 non-conjT2(A) (cf. Lemma 45). Not all A satisfying this condition are in cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) since the ABox AT2,\u03a3 cannot always be \u201ccaptured\u201d by a set of EL-concepts (cf. Example 4). Our modification of AT2,\u03a3 is motivated by the observation that if an ABox A does not contain any individual in the range of two distinct role names, then EL-concepts rather than Cran-concepts are sufficient to capture the consequences of the ABox. Thus, we are going to modify AT2,\u03a3 in a minimal way so that the resulting ABox does not contain any individual name in the range of two distinct role names.\nDefinition 51. An ABox A is role-splitting if there is no pair of assertions r(a, c), s(b, c) \u2208 A, for individual names a, b, c and distinct role names r, s.\nThe following lemma states the main property of role-splitting ABoxes.\nLemma 52. Let T1 and T2 be normalised ELHr-terminologies, \u03a3 a signature with A \u2208 \u03a3 and let A be a role-splitting \u03a3-ABox such that (T1,A) |= A(a) and (T2,A) 6|= A(a). Then A \u2208 cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2).\nProof. By Lemma 36, there exists n \u2265 0 such that T1 |= Cn,ranA,a v A and T2 6|= C n,ran A,a v A. Assume first that there does not exist b \u2208 obj(A) and r \u2208 \u03a3 such that r(b, a) \u2208 A. Then, by definition and since A is role-splitting, ran(r) only occurs in Cn,ranA,a in the direct scope of the existential restriction \u2203r. Hence Cn,ranA,a is equivalent to an EL\u03a3-concept, and we are done. Now assume there exists r(b, a) \u2208 A. Then, again since A is role-splitting, Cn,ranA,a is equivalent to a concept ran(r) u C, where C is an EL\u03a3-concept. In this case T1 |= ran(r) u C v A and T2 6|= ran(r) u C v A, as required.\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nFor a \u03a3-ABox A such that sig(A) \u2229 NR 6= \u2205, we define its role-splitting unfolding A with individuals { ar | a \u2208 obj(A), r \u2208 sig(A) \u2229 NR } by setting\nA = {A(ar) | A(a) \u2208 A, r \u2208 sig(A) \u2229 NR } \u222a { r(as, br) | r(a, b) \u2208 A, s \u2208 sig(A) \u2229 NR }.\nExample 53. Consider T1 = {ran(r) v A1, ran(s) v A2, B \u2261 A1 u A2}, T2 = \u2205, \u03a3 = {r, s, B} and A = {r(a, c), s(b, c)} from Example 4. We have (T1,A) |= B(c) but (T2,A) 6|= B(c). Notice that the role-splitting unfolding A = {r(ar, cr), r(as, cr), s(br, cs), s(bs, cs)} does not contain any individual in the range of more than one role\nA\na\nc\nb\nr s A\nar br\ncr\nas bs\ncs\nr\nr s\ns\nand (T1,A ) 6|= B(cr), (T1,A ) 6|= B(cs).\nWe apply the role-splitting unfolding to the ABox AT ,\u03a3 from Figure 6. The following result is the concept version of Lemma 44 and is proved in the appendix by a reduction to Lemma 44. The ABox AC corresponding to an EL-concept C has been introduced before Lemma 36. For simplicity, we consider signatures \u03a3 containing at least one role name.\nLemma 54. For every normalised ELHr-terminology T , signature \u03a3 such that \u03a3\u2229NR 6= \u2205, concept name A that is non-conjunctive in T , role name r \u2208 \u03a3, and EL\u03a3-concepts C the following conditions are equivalent for D = C and D = ran(r) u C:\n\u2022 T 6|= D v A;\n\u2022 for some r \u2208 \u03a3 \u2229 NR, (\u03beA)r \u2208 obj(A T ,\u03a3) and (AD, aD) \u2264ran\u03a3 (A T ,\u03a3, (\u03beA)r).\nThe following lemma can now be proved similarly to Lemma 45, using Lemma 54 instead of Lemma 44.\nLemma 55. Let T1 and T2 be normalised ELHr-terminologies, \u03a3 a signature with A \u2208 \u03a3 such that \u03a3 \u2229 NR 6= \u2205. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n\u2022 A \u2208 cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2);\n\u2022 there exists r \u2208 \u03a3 such that (T1,A T2,\u03a3) |= A((\u03beB)r) for some B \u2208 non-conjT2(A).\nProof. Assume that A \u2208 cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2). Then, there either exists an EL\u03a3-concept C with T1 |= C v A and T2 6|= C v A, or there additionally exists r \u2208 \u03a3 such that T1 |= ran(r) u C v A and T2 6|= ran(r) u C v A. Hence, for D = C and D = ran(r) u C, respectively, T2 6|= D v B, for some B \u2208 non-conjT2(A), and by Lemma 54, there exists r \u2208 \u03a3 with (\u03beA)r \u2208 obj(A T ,\u03a3) and (AD, aD) \u2264ran\u03a3 (A T2,\u03a3, (\u03beB)r). But then, by Lemma 42 (T1,A T2,\u03a3) |= A((\u03beB)r) as (T1,AD) |= A(aD) holds by Lemma 36.\nFor the converse direction, it is easy to see that (\u03beB)r \u2208 obj(A T2,\u03a3), \u03beB \u2208 obj(AT2,\u03a3), and (A T2,\u03a3, (\u03beB)r) \u2264 ran \u03a3 (AT2,\u03a3, \u03beB), which implies that (T2,A T2,\u03a3) 6|= A((\u03beB)r) by Lemma 44. Consequently, we obtain A \u2208 cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) by applying Lemma 52 and by using the fact that the ABox A T2,\u03a3 is role-splitting.\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nFinally, we obtain the tractability result.\nTheorem 56. Let T1 and T2 be ELHr-terminologies and \u03a3 a signature. Then the set cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) can be computed in polynomial time.\nProof. If \u03a3 \u2229 NR = \u2205, then cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) = iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2), which can be computed in polynomial time by Theorem 46.\nOtherwise \u03a3 \u2229 NR 6= \u2205 and the result follows from Lemma 55 and the fact that A T2,\u03a3 can be constructed in polynomial time in the size of T2.\n7. ELHr-Query Difference\nTo investigate the query difference between ELHr-terminologies, we introduce the language ELran,u,u that extends ELran with the universal role and intersections of roles. We show that concept differences in ELran,u,u correspond to query differences in ELHr. For ELran,u,u we can prove an analogue of Theorem 40, which states that any inclusion in the concept difference \u201ccontains\u201d an inclusion in which either the left-hand side or the right-hand side is atomic. Using the correspondence between concept difference in ELran,u,u and query difference in ELHr we then obtain a meaningful definition of a succinct representation of the query difference qDiff\u03a3(T1, T2). Finally, we provide polynomial-time algorithms deciding \u03a3-query inseparability and computing the succinct representation of the query difference.\n7.1 ELran,u,u-Concept Difference\nWe start this section by defining the language ELran,u,u.\nDefinition 57 (ELran,u,u). Let u (the universal role) be a fresh logical symbol. Cu,uconcepts are constructed using the following syntax rule\nC := A | C uD | \u2203R.C | \u2203u.C,\nwhere A \u2208 NC, C,D range over Cu,u-concepts and R = r1 u \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 u rn with r1, . . . , rn \u2208 NR for some n \u2265 1. The set of ELran,u,u-inclusions consists of concept inclusions C v D and role inclusions r v s, where C is a Cran-concept, D a Cu,u-concept, and r, s \u2208 NR.\nThe semantics of the additional constructors is straightforward by setting, for any interpretation I,\n\u2022 (r1 u \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 u rn)I = rI1 \u2229 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2229 rIn;\n\u2022 uI = \u2206I \u00d7\u2206I .\nNote that we regard the universal role u as a logical symbol; i.e., u 6\u2208 NR and sig(\u2203u.C) = sig(C) for any concept C. Assuming that u is a logical symbol reflects the fact that its firstorder translation uses no non-logical symbols. For example, the signature of the first-order translation \u2203x.A(x) of \u2203u.A does not contain any non-logical symbols with the exception of A itself.\nIt will be convenient to decompose Cu,u-concepts. The set of Cu-concepts is defined as the set of all Cu,u-concepts without the universal role. Every Cu,u-concept C is equivalent\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nto a concept of the form D0 u \u2203u.D1 u \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 u \u2203u.Dk, where D0, . . . , Dk are Cu-concepts. To see this, observe that any concept C with a subconcept \u2203u.D is equivalent to \u2203u.D u C \u2032, where C \u2032 is obtained from C by replacing all occurrences of \u2203u.D by >. For example, A u \u2203r.(B u \u2203u.E) is equivalent to the concept \u2203u.E uA u \u2203r.(B u >).\nIn the following we denote by Cu,u\u03a3 (Cu\u03a3) the set of all Cu,u (Cu) concepts whose signature is contained in \u03a3.\nClearly, every ELran-inclusion is an ELran,u,u-inclusion. In addition, role conjunctions and the universal role in ELran,u,u-inclusions can be used to capture differences between ELHr-TBoxes that cannot be captured by ELHr-inclusions.\nExample 58. We first reconsider Example 8. Recall that\nT1 = \u2205, T2 = {A v \u2203r.B}, \u03a3 = {A,B}.\nThen T2 |= A v \u2203u.B but T1 6|= A v \u2203u.B and, as the universal role is regarded as a logical symbol, sig(A v \u2203u.B) \u2286 \u03a3. Thus, by employing the universal role ELran,u,u we can simulate the query difference ({A(a)}, \u2203x.B(x)) using the subsumption A v \u2203u.B.\nSecond, we reconsider Example 9. Recall that\nT1 = {A v \u2203s.>, s v r1, s v r2}, T2 = {A v \u2203r1.> u \u2203r2.>}, \u03a3 = {A, r1, r2}.\nThen T1 |= A v \u2203(r1 u r2).> and T2 6|= A v \u2203(r1 u r2).>. Thus, we can simulate the query difference ({A(a)},\u2203x.(r1(a, x) \u2227 r2(a, x))) using the subsumption A v \u2203(r1 u r2).>.\nWe introduce the appropriate notion of \u03a3-concept difference for ELran,u,u.\nDefinition 59 (ELran,u,u\u03a3 -difference). The EL ran,u,u \u03a3 -difference between ELH r-TBoxes T1 and T2 is the set cDiffran,u,u\u03a3 (T1, T2) of all EL ran,u,u \u03a3 -inclusions \u03b1 such that T1 |= \u03b1 and T2 6|= \u03b1.\nWe now extend Lemma 39 for concepts that use the universal role or conjunctions of roles.\nLemma 60. Let T be an ELHr-terminology and \u2203R.D a Cu-concept with R = t1 u \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 u tq a conjunction of role names. Assume\nT |= l\n1\u2264i\u2264l ran(si) u\nl\n1\u2264j\u2264n Aj u\nl\n1\u2264k\u2264m \u2203rk.Ck v \u2203R.D,\nwhere Ck, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m, are Cran-concepts and l,m, n \u2265 0. Then at least one of the following conditions holds:\n(e1u) there exists rk, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m, such that rk vT t1,. . . , rk vT tq, and T |= Ckuran(rk) v D;\n(e2u) there exists Aj, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, such that T |= Aj v \u2203R.D; (e3u) there exists rk, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m, such that T |= \u2203rk.> v \u2203R.D; (e4u) there exists si, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l, such that T |= ran(si) v \u2203R.D.\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nIf u is the universal role and T |= C v \u2203u.D, where C is a Cran-concept and D is a Cu-concept, then at least one of the following holds:\n(e1u) there exists a subconcept \u2203r.C \u2032 of C such that T |= C \u2032 u ran(r)v D; (e2u) there exists a concept name A in C such that T |= A v \u2203u.D; (e3u) there exists a role name r in C such that T |= \u2203r.> v \u2203u.D; (e4u) there exists a role name r in C such that T |= ran(r) v \u2203u.D; (e5u) T |= C v D; (e6u) there exists a subconcept (ran(r) u C \u2032) of C such that T |= \u2203r.C \u2032 v D.\nTheorem 61 (Primitive witnesses for ELran,u,u). Let T1 and T2 be ELHr-terminologies and \u03a3 a signature. If \u03d5 \u2208 cDiffran,u,u\u03a3 (T1, T2), then either there exist {r, s} \u2286 sig(\u03d5) with r v s \u2208 cDiffran,u,u\u03a3 (T1, T2) or \u03d5 is of the form C v D, and one of\n1. C \u2032 v A\n2.

Let C v D \u2208 cDiffran,u,u\u03a3 (T1, T2), where C is a Cran-concept and D a Cu,u-concept. We prove the result by induction on the structure of D. The proof is very similar to the proof of Theorem 40 and so we consider the case D = \u2203u.D1 only. Let C = d 1\u2264i\u2264l ran(si)ud\n1\u2264j\u2264nAj u d\n1\u2264k\u2264m \u2203rk.Ck. Then, by Lemma 60, one of (e1u)\u2013(e6u) holds. Cases (e2u)\u2013(e4u) directly entail the existence of an inclusion from Point 2 of the theorem. In case (e1u) there exists a subconcept \u2203r.C \u2032 of C such that T1 |= C \u2032uran(r) v D1. We have that T2 6|= C \u2032 u ran(r) v D1 as otherwise we have T2 |= \u2203r.C \u2032 v \u2203r.D1, i.e. T2 |= C v D would hold. Thus, C \u2032 u ran(r) v D1 \u2208 cDiffran,u,u\u03a3 (T1, T2). We can apply the induction hypothesis to D1 and infer that an inclusion from Point 1 or Point 2 exists.\nSimilarly, for case (e5u), we have C v D1 \u2208 cDiffran,u,u\u03a3 (T1, T2) as otherwise T2 |= C v D1, i.e. T2 |= C v D due to D = \u2203u.D1. By applying the induction hypothesis to D1, we obtain that an inclusion from Point 1 or Point 2 exists.\nFinally, in case (e6u) there exists a subconcept ran(r)uC \u2032 of C such that T1 |= \u2203r.C \u2032 v D1. Observe first that for every model I of T2 and for every d \u2208 CI , there exists d\u2032 \u2208 (ran(r) u C \u2032)I , which implies that there exists d\u2032\u2032 \u2208 (\u2203r.C \u2032)I . If we now assume that T2 |= \u2203r.C \u2032 v D1, it would follow that for every model I of T2 and for every d \u2208 CI , there exists d\u2032\u2032 \u2208 DI1 , i.e. T2 |= C v \u2203u.D1 would hold. We can infer that \u2203r.C \u2032 v D1 \u2208 cDiffran,u,u\u03a3 (T1, T2) and by applying the induction hypothesis to D1, we conclude that an inclusion from Point 1 or Point 2 exists."}, {"heading": "7.2 Query Difference Witnesses", "text": "We start by connecting concept differences in ELran,u,u with query differences between ELHr-terminologies. The direction from query differences in ELHr to concept differences in ELran,u,u is straightforward: observe that every assertion C(a) with C a Cu,u-concept can\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nbe regarded as a Boolean conjunctive query qC,a. For example, the assertion (\u2203u.Au\u2203r.B)(a) is equivalent to the conjunctive query \u2203x\u2203y.(A(x)\u2227r(a, y)\u2227B(y)) (details of the translation are provided in the appendix). We obtain (where AC is the ABox defined before Lemma 36):\nLemma 62. For any two ELHr-TBoxes T1 and T2 and signature \u03a3, we have C v D \u2208 cDiffran,u,u\u03a3 (T1, T2) if, and only if, (AC , qD,aC ) \u2208 qDiff\u03a3(T1, T2).\nIn what follows we will not distinguish between an assertion C(a) with C a Cu,u-concept and the conjunctive query qC,a. It follows from Lemma 62 that if qDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) = \u2205, then cDiffran,u,u\u03a3 (T1, T2) = \u2205.\nWe come to the (considerably more involved) direction from query differences to concept differences in ELran,u,u. The following lemma provides a rather abstract description of how inclusions in qDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) are reflected by members of cDiff ran,u,u \u03a3 (T1, T2) by stating that they are given in the same signature.\nLemma 63. For any two ELHr-TBoxes T1 and T2 and signature \u03a3, if \u03d5 \u2208 qDiff\u03a3(T1, T2), then there exists \u03d5\u2032 \u2208 cDiffran,u,u\u03a3 (T1, T2) with sig(\u03d5\u2032) \u2286 sig(\u03d5).\nThe interested reader can extract a more detailed description from the proof given in the appendix. The proof of Lemma 63 given in the appendix is model-theoretic and employs the close relationship between conjunctive query entailment and homomorphisms (Chandra & Merlin, 1977). The intuition behind the result, however, is rather straightforward: if (T ,A) |= q[~a] for a conjunctive query q(~x) = \u2203~y\u03c8(~x, ~y) and ELHr-TBox T , then for every model I of (T ,A) there is a mapping \u03c0 from the variables ~x and ~y into \u2206I such that ~a is a \u03c0-match of q(~x) and I. (T ,A) has models that are essentially forest-shaped: they consist of tree-shaped models attached to the ABox individuals in A (cf. Lutz et al., 2009). In such forest-shaped models, the individuals from ~y that are not mapped to individuals in A are mapped to the trees attached to the ABox individuals. Such a mapping, however, exists already for a conjunctive query q\u2032 such that q is a homomorphic image of q\u2032 and q\u2032 is essentially forest-shaped: the individuals not mapped to ABox individuals form trees that are attached to the core of q\u2032 that is mapped to the ABox individuals. In other words, we obtain q\u2032 by partitioning q into a core and into subsets that correspond to Cu,u-concepts! Now, if there exists a \u03a3-ABox A and a conjunctive \u03a3-query q(~a) such that (T2,A) |= q[~a] and (T1,A) 6|= q[~a], then we find such a conjunctive \u03a3-query q\u2032 with the same behaviour as q that is essentially forest-shaped. From (A, q\u2032) one can then obtain the required ELran,u,uinclusion C v D, where D captures some subtree of the query q\u2032 (a Cu,u-concept) and C (a Cran-concept) the ABox A. The intuition for the last step is exactly the same as for Lemma 36.\nWe note that the result holds for general TBoxes and not only terminologies. From Lemma 63 and Theorem 61, we directly obtain the following description of primitive witnesses for query differences.\nTheorem 64 (Primitive witness for ELHr-query differences). Let T1 and T2 be ELHrterminologies and \u03a3 a signature. If \u03d5 \u2208 qDiff\u03a3(T1, T2), then at least one of the following conditions holds (for some individual names a, b):\n1. ({r(a, b)}, s(a, b)) \u2208 qDiff\u03a3(T1, T2), for some r, s \u2208 sig(\u03d5);\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\n2.

We can, therefore, define the following finite representation of the \u03a3-query difference. Assume T1 and T2 are given. Define the set\n\u2022 qWtnR\u03a3(T1, T2) of role \u03a3-query difference witnesses as the set of role \u03a3-instance difference witnesses; i.e., qWtnR\u03a3(T1, T2) = iWtnR\u03a3(T1, T2);\n\u2022 qWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) of right-hand \u03a3-query difference witnesses as the set of right-hand \u03a3-instance difference witnesses; i.e., qWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) = iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2);\n\u2022 qWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) of left-hand \u03a3-instance difference witnesses as the set of all A \u2208 \u03a3 such that there exists a Cu,u-concept C with ({A(a)}, C(a)) \u2208 qDiff lhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) and all r \u2208 \u03a3 such that there exists a Cu,u-concept C such that ({r(a, b)}, C(c)) \u2208 qDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) for c = a or c = b.\nThe set of all \u03a3-query difference witnesses is defined as\nqWtn\u03a3(T1, T2) = (qWtnR\u03a3(T1, T2), qWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2), qWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2)).\nBy Theorem 64, qWtn\u03a3(T1, T2) = (\u2205, \u2205, \u2205) if, and only if, qDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) = \u2205. Algorithms computing qWtnR\u03a3(T1, T2) and qWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) have been presented in the section on instance difference. It thus remains to consider qWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2).\n7.3 Tractability of qWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2)\nTo prove tractability of qWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) we first capture the expressive power of Cu,u-concepts using a stronger form of simulation between interpretations. Let I1 and I2 be interpretations. A \u03a3-simulation S between I1 and I2 is called a global intersection preserving \u03a3-simulation if, in addition,\n\u2022 for every d \u2208 \u2206I1 there exists a d\u2032 \u2208 \u2206I2 with (d, d\u2032) \u2208 S;\n\u2022 if (d, e) \u2208 S, d\u2032 \u2208 \u2206I1 , and R = {r \u2208 \u03a3 | (d, d\u2032) \u2208 rI1} 6= \u2205, then there exists e\u2032 with (e, e\u2032) \u2208 S and (d\u2032, e\u2032) \u2208 rI2 for all r \u2208 R.\nWe write (I1, d) \u2264\u2229\u03a3 (I2, e) if there exists a global intersection preserving \u03a3-simulation S between I1 and I2 such that (d, e) \u2208 S.\nLemma 65. Let I1 and I2 be finite interpretations, \u03a3 a signature, d \u2208 \u2206I1, and e \u2208 \u2206I2. Then\n(I1, d) \u2264\u2229\u03a3 (I2, e) \u21d4 for all C \u2208 C u,u \u03a3 : d \u2208 CI1 \u21d2 e \u2208 CI2 .\nIt can be checked in polynomial time whether (I1, d) \u2264\u2229\u03a3 (I2, e).\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nThe proof is a straightforward extension of the proof of Lemma 29 and the polynomialtime algorithm deciding the existence of \u03a3-simulations.\nWe observe that Theorem 2 about the properties of the canonical model IK of a KB K can be extended to Cu,u-concepts (in the appendix, the proof is given for Cu,u-concepts as well). Namely, we have for all Cu,u-concepts C0:\n\u2022 K |= C0(a) if, and only if, aIK \u2208 CIK0 .\n\u2022 T |= C uD v C0 if, and only if, xC,D \u2208 CIK0 .\nIt follows that for any concept name A \u2208 \u03a3, we have\nA \u2208 qWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) \u21d4 (IK1 , a) 6\u2264\u2229\u03a3 (IK2 , a),\nwhere Ki = (Ti,A) and A = {A(a)}, for i = 1, 2. We also have for every role name r \u2208 \u03a3 that\nr \u2208 qWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) \u21d4 (IK1 , a) 6\u2264\u2229\u03a3 (IK2 , a) or (IK1 , b) 6\u2264\u2229\u03a3 (IK2 , b)\nwhere Ki = (Ti,A) and A = {r(a, b)}, for i = 1, 2. Thus, we obtain the following tractability result:\nTheorem 66. Let T1 and T2 be ELHr-terminologies and \u03a3 a signature. Then the set qWtnlhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) can be computed in polynomial time."}, {"heading": "8.

We also set\ncWtnlhs,X\u03a3 (T1, T2) = iWtn lhs,X(T1, T2)\nfor X \u2208 {A, dom, ran}. To compute iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2), CEX2 exploits that cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) \u2286 iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) (Lemma 50) and first computes iWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2) and then checks using a straightforward variant of the NotWitness algorithm for concept differences whether A \u2208 cWtnrhs\u03a3 (T1, T2).\nIn the following three subsections we describe the experiments that we have conducted. The experimental settings were as follows. All programs were run on PCs equipped with an Intel Core 2 Duo E6400 CPU and 3 GiB of main memory. Version 2.0.1 of CEX2 was used."}, {"heading": "8.1 Comparing Different Versions of Snomed CT", "text": "We applied CEX2 to compare a January 2009 (SM09a) and a July 2009 (SM09b) version of Snomed CT. SM09a and SM09b contain 310013 and 307693 concept names, respectively. Both versions use the same 62 role names, and they contain role inclusions but no domain or range restrictions are present. Consequently, one can infer from Corollary 47 that iWtn\u03a3(SM09b,SM09a) = cWtn\u03a3(SM09b,SM09a). In what follows we consider cWtn\u03a3(SM09b,SM09a) only.\nFor our experiments we used signatures ranging over so called Snomed CT subsets, which are employed in the UK for the deployment of Snomed CT in specific areas. We compared SM09a with SM09b on 159 such signatures \u03a3 by computing cWtn\u03a3(SM09b,SM09a) for each of these sets \u03a3. The considered signatures always contain all of the 62 Snomed CT role names. The comparisons which resulted in a non-empty difference are reproduced\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nin Table 2. In none of the cases, differences regarding role inclusions have been detected. In Table 2, the second column gives the number of concept names in the respective subset \u03a3, and the third and fifth column the number of concept witness differences. Observe that the number of differences does not correlate with the size of the considered signatures \u03a3, i.e. there exist signatures that are somewhat comparable in size, but induce a greatly varying number of difference witnesses (see e.g. the subsets \u201cDiagnosis\u201d and \u201cManumat\u201d).\nIn order to determine how many difference witnesses computed by CEX2 can be obtained from a straightforward comparison of the class hierarchies already, we have also computed the sets\nclsWtnlhs\u03a3 (SM09b,SM09a) = {A \u2208 \u03a3 | \u2203B \u2208 \u03a3: A v B \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(SM09b, SM09a) }\nand\nclsWtnrhs\u03a3 (SM09b,SM09a) = {B \u2208 \u03a3 | \u2203A \u2208 \u03a3: A v B \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(SM09b, SM09a) }\nfor each of the considered comparison signatures \u03a3. The results that we have obtained are also depicted in Table 2. One can see that often a great number of differences cannot be detected by considering the classification difference only.\nIn the last three columns of Table 2, we give the CPU times required for computing all concept witnesses:\n\u2022 first, the times are given when CEX2 is directly applied to the full terminologies SM09a and SM09b;\n\u2022 second, the times are given when one first extracts \u03a3-modules using the module extraction tool MEX (Konev, Lutz, Walther, & Wolter, 2008) from SM09a and, respectively, SM09b and then applies CEX2 to the extracted \u03a3-modules. Observe that a \u03a3-module extracted by MEX is \u03a3-query (and, therefore, \u03a3-concept and \u03a3-instance) inseparable from the whole terminology. Thus, the computed concept witnesses are the same.\n\u2022 finally, the times are given if, in addition to computing concept witnesses from the full terminologies SM09a and SM09b, CEX2 also computes examples of concept inclusions in the logical difference that explain the witnesses. We discuss this feature of CEX2 below.\nOne can observe that extracting MEX modules leads to a significant improvement of the performance of CEX2. Of course, if the signature is very large (e.g., for \u201cDiagnosis\u201d and \u201cFinding\u201d), the resulting modules are almost as large as Snomed CT itself and the effect is less significant. Secondly, one can observe that the additional computation of example concept inclusions in the logical difference roughly doubles the times needed for the comparison.\nFinally, to evaluate the practical feasibility of using the ABox approach to compute the sets iWtnrhs\u03a3 (SM09b,SM09a), we have implemented the computation of ABoxes AT ,\u03a3 together with an ABox reasoning algorithm for checking the second condition of Lemma 45. We have then tested our implementation on the subsets \u03a3 of Snomed CT used for evaluating the performance of CEX2. To limit the size of the ABoxes AT ,\u03a3 and to speed up computations, we first computed modules using MEX. The results that we obtained are\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nshown in Table 3. The size of the \u03a3-modules computed by MEX, i.e. T1 of SM09b and T2 of SM09a, is shown in columns two and three, respectively. As expected from the definition of AT ,\u03a3, one can observe that the number of concept and role membership assertions present in the ABoxes AT2,\u03a3 can grow very large, even for modules and signatures with only a few thousand concept names.\nFor 8 of the 41 considered subsets our implementation ran out of available physical memory (indicated by a time value \u2018-\u2019) when all possible concept membership consequences of the ABox were to be computed. Overall, we observed the longest execution time of over 5 hours for the set \u201cSpecmatyp\u201d. In conclusion, one can see that a straightforward implementation of the ABox approach is practically useful \u201conly\u201d for terminologies and signatures of a few thousand concept names."}, {"heading": "8.2 Comparing Different Versions of the NCI Thesaurus", "text": "We have also used the CEX2 tool to compare distinct versions of the NCI Thesaurus. Most distributed releases of the NCI Thesaurus contain language constructs which are not part of ELHr (such as disjunction and value restriction). To obtain ELHr-terminologies, we have removed all inclusions that contain a non-ELHr constructor from the original terminologies. Typically, this affected 5%-8% of the inclusions present in each of the distributed NCI versions. Most of the ELHr-versions generated in this way contain role inclusions as well as domain and range restrictions.\nSimilarly to the work of Gonc\u0327alves et al. (2011), we have compared 71 consecutive ELHr-versions of the NCI Thesaurus ranging between the versions 03.10J and 10.02d, with the exception of 05.03F and 05.04d, which could not be parsed correctly. Version 10.03h and some later versions of the NCI Thesaurus are not acyclic, and hence, they could not be handled by the CEX2 tool.\nFor any two consecutive versions NCIn and NCIn+1 within the considered range, we computed the sets cWtn\u03a3(NCIn+1,NCIn) and iWtn\u03a3(NCIn+1,NCIn) on signatures \u03a3 = sig(NCIn) \u2229 sig(NCIn+1). An overview of the set sizes for cWtnrhs\u03a3 (NCIn+1,NCIn) and cWtnlhs,A\u03a3 (NCIn+1,NCIn) that we obtained can be found in Figure 8. The comparisons are sorted chronologically along the x-axis according to the release dates of the NCI ontology versions, whereas the corresponding number of left-hand atomic difference witnesses or right-hand difference witnesses can be found on the y-axis. One can see the number of righthand difference witnesses remained fairly low throughout the different versions. However, occasional spikes occurred in the number of left-hand atomic difference witnesses with a maximum value of 33487 for comparing the versions 05.01d and 05.03d. Moreover, in none of the comparisons except for those shown in Figure 9 left-hand role domain or left-hand role range difference witnesses were identified. Overall, no witnesses regarding role inclusions were detected and we found that for every two considered consecutive versions NCIn and NCIn+1 on \u03a3 = sig(NCIn) \u2229 sig(NCIn+1),\ncWtn\u03a3(NCIn+1,NCIn) = iWtn\u03a3(NCIn+1,NCIn).\nA running time of 140 seconds and 228 MiB of memory were required on average for computing witnesses and example inclusions for iDiff\u03a3(NCIn+1,NCIn). Computing witnesses and example inclusions for cDiff\u03a3(NCIn+1,NCIn) on average took 157 seconds and used 228 MiB of memory.\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nThe peaks in atomic left-hand difference witnesses mostly resulted from changes to a few very general concepts. As mentioned above already, Gonc\u0327alves et al. (2011) provide an indepth analysis of NCI versions. A systematic comparison of the methods used by Gonc\u0327alves et al. with the logical diff introduced in this paper would be very interesting, but is beyond the scope of this paper. One interesting observation that can be made is, however, that the peak of atomic left-hand witnesses that we observed between the versions 05.01d and 05.03d correlates with the fact that according to Gonc\u0327alves et al. a large number of non-redundant axioms were added to version 05.03d. However, a comparable number of non-redundant axioms were also added to version 04.12g, but no peak in atomic left-hand or right-hand witnesses was observed in our analysis."}, {"heading": "8.3 Scalability Analysis", "text": "We demonstrated in the previous sections that CEX2 is capable of finding the logical difference between two unmodified versions of Snomed CT and between distinct versions of the NCI thesaurus restricted to ELHr. In order to see how CEX2\u2019s performance scales, we have also tested it on randomly generated acyclic terminologies of various sizes. Each randomly generated terminology contains a certain number of defined- and primitive concept names and role names. The ratio between concept equations and concept inclusions is fixed, as is the ratio between existential restrictions and conjunctions. The random terminologies were generated for a varying number of defined concept names using the parameters of SM09a: 62 role names; the equality-inclusion ratio is 0.525; and the exists-conjunction ratio is 0.304. For every chosen size, we generated 10 samples consisting of two random terminologies as described above. We then applied CEX2 to find the logical difference of the two terminologies over their joint signature. Figure 10 shows the average memory consumption of CEX2 over 10 randomly generated terminologies of various sizes. In 10(a) the maximum length of conjunctions was fixed as two (M=2), and in 10(b) the number of conjuncts in each conjunction is randomly selected between two and M. It can be seen that the performance of CEX2 crucially depends on the length of conjunctions. In 10(b), the curves break off at the point where CEX2 runs out of physical memory6. For instance, in the case of M=22, this happens for terminologies with more than 7 500 defined concept names. Finally, we note that the time required by CEX2 to compare two such random terminologies highly varied across the different samples. The maximum time required by CEX2 was 11 333 seconds."}, {"heading": "8.4 Additional User Support for Analysing Differences", "text": "So far we have discussed experiments with CEX2 in which one computes the set of concept and instance difference witnesses between two terminologies. Clearly, such witnesses do not provide sufficient information for a detailed analysis of the logical difference between two terminologies. For a more thorough analysis, it is required to consider examples \u03b1 from cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) and iDiff\u03a3(T1, T2) that show why certain concept names are concept/instance difference witnesses. Thus, whenever it searches for concept names A such that there exists a C with C v A \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2), CEX2 can output example concept inclusions C v A \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(T1, T2). Similarly, if requested, CEX2 can also compute example inclusions\n6. In some cases the classification of the terminologies through CB already requires more than 3 GiB of memory.\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nillustrating left-hand concept differences A v C, \u2203r.> v C, or ran(r) v C, and examples for the instance difference case. We know from Example 12 that even minimal such examples can be of exponential size in the input terminologies. In practice, however, for Snomed CT and NCI the additional computation of an example inclusion for every concept/instance difference witness \u201conly\u201d doubles the times required for the computation. As described above already, this can be observed in Table 2, where the computation times with examples are shown in the last column and the computation times without examples are shown in the 7th column. The examples computed by CEX2 are often of reasonable size. For instance, if we consider the subset \u201cSpecimen Material Type\u201d (Specmatyp) from Table 2, it holds that\n(i) there exist 10 right-hand \u03a3-concept witnesses, i.e. |cWtnrhs\u03a3 (SM09b,SM09a)| = 10;\n(ii) the set of left-hand atomic \u03a3-concept difference witnesses, cWtnlhs,A\u03a3 (SM09b,SM09a), contains 46 concept names.\nIn Point (i) and (ii), the longest concepts C, D for C v A \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(SM09b,SM09a) and A v D \u2208 cDiff\u03a3(SM09b, SM09a) that were computed by CEX2 had twelve concept and role name occurrences (thus were far smaller than the exponential worst case suggests).\nHaving computed not only difference witnesses but also example concept inclusions for witnesses, it is of interest to explain why an example concept inclusion is entailed by one terminology but not the other. Computing minimal subsets of a terminology that entail an example concept inclusion is a promising approach to explaining logical differences that is also known as axiom pinpointing or justification. It is not supported by CEX2, but has been investigated extensively for various description logics including EL (Schlobach & Cornet, 2003; Baader, Pen\u0303aloza, & Suntisrivaraporn, 2007; Kalyanpur, Parsia, Horridge, & Sirin, 2007; Horridge, Parsia, & Sattler, 2010; Pen\u0303aloza & Sertkaya, 2010). To illustrate this approach, consider again the subset \u201cSpecimen Material Type\u201d (Specmatyp) from Table 2. CEX2 outputs\nVenipunctureForBloodTest \u2208 cWtnlhs,A\u03a3 (SM09b,SM09a).\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nIt also computes the following concept inclusion (slightly simplified by hand) as a member of cDiff\u03a3(SM09b, SM09a):\n(\u2217) VenipunctureForBloodTestv \u2203roleGroup.\u2203hasFocus.EvaluationProcedure\nUsing axiom pinpointing one can then compute a minimal set of inclusions from SM09b which entails the concept inclusion above; such a set is shown in Figure 11. Axioms 2 and 3 are in both terminologies, but SM09a contains\nLaboratoryTest v LaboratoryProcedure\ninstead of Axiom 1, which explains this difference between the two terminologies. Note that concept and role names from \u03a3 are shaded in grey. It can be seen that the interaction between \u03a3-concepts heavily depends on inclusions that are built up mainly from non-\u03a3concepts; actually none of inclusions required to derive (\u2217) is a \u03a3-inclusion.\nWe finally note that CEX2 is a text-based tool. In order to make it more accessible to ontology users, a Prote\u0301ge\u0301 plugin, LogDiffViz7, was created, which calls CEX2 and visualises both ontology versions and the differences as a hierarchical structure. LogDiffViz also provides basic axiom pinpointing. The plugin is distributed as a self-contained Java archive file (JAR) in which CEX2 is bundled."}, {"heading": "9. Related Work", "text": "We describe the relationship between the work presented in this paper and existing work on logical difference and inseparability of ontologies. Related work on versioning and the distinction between syntactical, structural, and logic-based approaches to versioning have been discussed in the introduction already and will not be presented again here. The problem of deciding whether two ontologies are \u03a3-inseparable for some signature \u03a3 has been investigated for many ontology languages and different notions of inseparability such as concept inseparability, instance inseparability, conjunctive query inseparability, and model-theoretic inseparability (i.e., the \u03a3-reducts of models of the first ontology coincide with the \u03a3-reducts of models of the second ontology). Inseparability is also closely related to the notion of conservative extensions since one ontology is a conservative extension of another ontology if it contains the other ontology as a subset and both are inseparable w.r.t. the signature of\n7. Available at http://protegewiki.stanford.edu/wiki/Logical_Difference_Vizualiser_(LogDiffViz)\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nthe smaller ontology. Thus, algorithmic results on deciding conservativity are directly relevant for inseparability as well. The tractability results presented in this paper are in sharp contrast to most other known results. We start with general EL-TBoxes: for general ELTBoxes deciding inseparability and conservative extensions are ExpTime complete problems for concept, instance and conjunctive queries. Both problems are undecidable for modeltheoretic inseparability and model-theoretic conservative extensions (Lutz & Wolter, 2010). (We note, however, that in the model-theoretic case unexpected positive algorithmic results have been obtained in Konev, Lutz, et al., 2008, for acyclic EL and ALC and their extensions with inverse roles.) For ALC and its standard extensions without nominals deciding concept inseparability and conservative extensions is 2ExpTime-complete (Ghilardi, Lutz, & Wolter, 2006; Lutz et al., 2007; Lutz & Wolter, 2011) and for ALCQIO deciding concept inseparability and conservative extensions becomes undecidable (Lutz et al., 2007; Cuenca Grau et al., 2008). Nothing is known for ALC about the complexity of inseparability for instance and conjunctive queries. For DL-Lite dialects (Calvanese, Giacomo, Lembo, Lenzerini, & Rosati, 2006), the complexity of concept, instance, and query inseparability ranges from PSpace-hard (and in ExpTime) for the description logic underlying the OWL 2 QL standard, NP-complete for DL-Litehorn, and \u03a0 p 2-complete for DL-Litebool (Konev, Kontchakov, Ludwig, Schneider, Wolter, & Zakharyaschev, 2011; Kontchakov et al., 2010). For DLLitebool model-theoretic inseparability is decidable (Kontchakov et al., 2010) and for DLLitecore concept, instance, and query inseparability are in PTime (Konev et al., 2011). In contrast to the work presented in this paper, however, no attempt is made to present the logical difference to the user if two ontology are not inseparable. As mentioned above, in the work of Konev et al. (2012), CEX2 is extended to the conjunctive query difference case between acyclic ELHr-terminologies and various experiments based on the NCI thesaurus are discussed.\nThe work discussed so far is concerned with the logical difference and inseparability between description logic TBoxes. The difference between description logic concepts has been investigated, for example, in the work of Teege (1994), and of Brandt, Ku\u0308sters, and Turhan (2002) but besides of the interest in some kind of difference the problems considered as well as the techniques employed are rather different. Inseparability and conservativity between ontologies given in ontology languages that are more expressive than description logics (including first-order logic) have been considered in the work of Kutz and Mossakowski (2008, 2011). Similar relationships between theories have also been investigated in answer set programming (Pearce & Valverde, 2004; Eiter, Fink, & Woltran, 2007; Pearce & Valverde, 2012).\nFinally, we note that Lemma 15 and the ABox constructed in Figure 3 appear to capture and describe fundamental properties of EL and ELHr-terminologies. Both have been applied to investigate seemingly unrelated problems such as query containment for ontology based data access using EL-terminologies (Bienvenu, Lutz, & Wolter, 2012b) and first-order rewritability of instance queries (Bienvenu, Lutz, & Wolter, 2012a)."}, {"heading": "10.

Experiments using CEX2 based on SNOMED CT and NCI show that the outputs given by our algorithm are mostly of reasonable size and can be analysed by users. Many extensions, applications, and open problems remain to be explored. Here we mention some of them:\n(1) We have motivated the study of \u03a3-inseparability between terminologies by the problem of comparing different versions of a terminology regarding \u201cwhat they say\u201d about a certain signature. Other potential and promising applications can be found in the area of decomposing and composing ontologies. For example, when importing an ontology T into an ontology T \u2032 (i.e., forming T \u222a T \u2032) it is often important to ensure that T \u2032 does not interfere with the signature of T . In other words, T \u222aT \u2032 should be a conservative extension of T in the sense that the consequences of T \u222a T \u2032 in the signature of T should coincide with the consequences of T itself (Cuenca Grau et al., 2008; Ghilardi et al., 2006; Vescovo, Parsia, Sattler, & Schneider, 2011). As observed above already, \u03a3-inseparability generalises conservative extensions and, therefore, our algorithms can be used to check whether one terminology is a conservative extension of another terminology. Algorithms checking conservative extensions can also be used to extract modules from ontologies (Cuenca Grau et al., 2008; Kontchakov, Pulina, Sattler, Schneider, Selmer, Wolter, & Zakharyaschev, 2009; Konev et al., 2011). It would be of interest to explore applications of our inseparability testing algorithms to extract modules of terminologies and check conservativity.\n(2) Inseparability as defined in this paper does not mean that one terminology can be replaced by another terminology in every context. In various applications of inseparability for modularity it is important to ensure that if T1 and T2 are \u03a3-inseparable, then T1 \u222a T and T2 \u222a T are \u03a3-inseparable as well, for any ontology T . This is called the replacement property by Konev, Lutz, Walther, and Wolter (2009) and has been exploited and discussed, for example, in the work of Cuenca Grau et al. (2008) and of Kontchakov et al. (2010). The notions of inseparability introduced in this paper do not have the replacement property. To see this, let \u03a3 = {A,A\u2032, B,B\u2032} and\nT1 = {\nA v \u2203r.B A\u2032 \u2261 \u2203r.B\u2032\n} and T2 = { A v \u2203r.B A\u2032 v \u2203r.B\u2032 } .\nT1 and T2 are \u03a3-query inseparable (and, therefore, \u03a3-concept and \u03a3-instance inseparable), but T1 \u222a T is not even \u03a3-concept inseparable from T2 \u222a T , for T = {B v B\u2032}. Indeed, observe that (T1 \u222a T ) |= A v A\u2032, but (T2 \u222a T ) 6|= A v A\u2032.\nIt is an important open research problem to determine the complexity of, and to develop algorithms for strong versions of inseparability with the replacement property for EL and ELHr-terminologies.\n(3) ELHr is a rather weak description logic. It would be of great interest to explore in how far techniques developed for ELHr can be applied to ontologies which contain additional constructors, but still consist mainly of ELHr-inclusions. It is unlikely that tractable sound and complete algorithms for interesting extensions exist, but it seems worth exploring algorithms that are sound and incomplete extensions of the algorithms presented in this paper. Some results in that direction have been presented by Gonc\u0327alves, Parsia, and Sattler (2012).\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter"}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This research was supported by EPSRC grant EP/H043594/1.

Proofs for Section 2", "text": "Lemma 1 For every terminology T , one can construct in polynomial time a normalised terminology T \u2032 of polynomial size in |T | such that sig(T ) \u2286 sig(T \u2032), T \u2032 |= T , and for every model I of T there exists a model J of T \u2032 such that \u2206I = \u2206J and XI = XJ for every X \u2208 sig(T ). Moreover, T \u2032 is acyclic if T is acyclic.\nProof. Given a terminology T , construct a normalised terminology T \u2032 in five steps as follows: First, remove all occurrences of > in conjunctions, and replace C in each occurrence of \u2203r.C, where C is not a concept name or >, with a fresh concept name A and add the concept definition A \u2261 C to the terminology. Repeat the last step exhaustively.\nSecond, replace every \u2203ri.Bi in each inclusion with a right-hand side of the form F u \u2203r1.B1 u \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 u \u2203rm.Bm (m \u2265 1), where each Bi is either a concept name or Bi = >, and F is a conjunction of concept names such that F 6= > or m \u2265 2, with a fresh concept name B\u2032i and add the concept definition B \u2032 i \u2261 \u2203ri.Bi to the terminology.\nThird, replace every inclusion of the form A \u2261 \u2203r.> with two inclusions A v \u2203r.> and \u2203r.> v A in the terminology.\nFourth, consider any concept name A such that there are sequences B0, . . . , Bn\u22121 and F0, . . . , Fn, where the Fi are conjunctions of concept names, such that the terminology contains the concept definitions A \u2261 F0 and Bi \u2261 Fi+1, for i < n, where Bi is a conjunct of Fi and A a conjunct of Fn. Let F \u2032 n be the conjunction of concept names in Fn except A. Let, recursively, F \u2032i\u22121 be the result of replacing the conjunct Bi\u22121 in Fi\u22121 with the conjunction F \u2032i , for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Replace the concept definition A \u2261 F0 in the terminology with the primitive concept definition A v F \u20320.\nFifth, for each inclusion A \u2261 F , A v F , \u2203r.> v F , or ran(r) v F , where F is a conjunction of concept names, replace every conjunct B in F for which there is a B \u2261 F \u2032 in the terminology, where F \u2032 is a conjunction of non-conjunctive concept names, with F \u2032.\nTo see that the construction indeed yields a normalised terminology T \u2032, observe that the steps 1, 2, and 3 ensure that each inclusion has one of the following forms: A \u2261 \u2203r.B, A \u2261 F , E v \u2203r.B, E v \u2203r.>, or E v F , where B is a concept name, E is either a concept name, or is of the form \u2203s.>, or ran(s), and F is a conjunction of (possibly conjunctive) concept names. Step 4 breaks cycles in concept definitions and Step 5 takes care that all conjuncts of the conjunction of concept names F in the right-hand side of each inclusion of the form A \u2261 F , A v F , \u2203r.> v F , or ran(r) v F are non-conjunctive concept names. It is readily verified that T \u2032 is acyclic if T is acyclic as none of the above steps introduces cycles in concept definitions.\nWe now show that T \u2032 can be obtained in polynomial time and that T \u2032 is of polynomial size in |T |. Let n be the number of inclusions in T and c the maximal length of an inclusion\u2019s right-hand side in T . Clearly, the steps 1, 2 and 3 each do not increase the number of inclusions by more than c \u00b7n, raising the total number of inclusions to at most 4nc. Steps 4\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nand 5 do not increase the number of inclusions, but the length of their right-hand sides. The length of the right-hand side of an inclusion can increase to at most the sum of the lengths of the right-hand sides of all inclusions, i.e., 4nc2 is an upper bound for each right-hand side. The upper bound of the running time for each of the steps in the construction is therefore 16n2c3. Hence, the size of T \u2032 and the running time of the construction are both in O(n2 \u00b7 c3).\nNotice that every new concept name occurs on the left-hand side of a unique concept definition A \u2261 C in T \u2032. Thus, every model I of T can be expanded to a model J of T \u2032 by interpreting the fresh concept names in sig(T \u2032) \\ sig(T ) by setting AJ = CI .\nMoreover, it is readily checked that T \u2032 |= T .\nWe prove an extended version of Theorem 2 according to which not only EL-concepts and concepts of the form ran(r) are evaluated \u201ccorrectly\u201d in the canonical model IK, but also Cu,u-concepts (which are introduced in Definition 57).\nTheorem 2[Extended Version] Let K = (T ,A) be an ELHr-KB.

Point 2 follows from the fact that instance checking in ELHr can be done in polynomial time.\nWe first prove Point 3 for EL-concepts C0 \u2208 sub(T ). The proof is by simultaneous induction on the construction of C0. The interesting step is for C0 = \u2203r.D0.\nWe start with the proof of the direction from left to right. Assume first that K |= C0(a). Then (a, xran(r),D0) \u2208 rIK . We have T |= (ran(r) u D0) v D0. Thus, by the induction hypothesis, xran(r),D0 \u2208 D IK 0 . But then a \u2208 C IK 0 , as required. Now assume T |= CuD v C0. Then (xC,D, xran(r),D0) \u2208 rIK . We have T |= (ran(r) u D0) v D0. By the induction hypothesis, xran(r),D0 \u2208 D IK 0 . But then xC,D \u2208 C IK 0 , as required.\nConversely, assume that aIK \u2208 CIK0 . There exists d \u2208 \u2206IK such that (aIK , d) \u2208 rIK and d \u2208 DIK0 . Assume first that d = b \u2208 obj(A). By the induction hypothesis, K |= D0(b). There exists s such that s(a, b) \u2208 A and s vT r. Thus, K |= C0(a), as required. Assume now that d = xran(s),F . Then K |= \u2203s.F (a), s vT r and xran(s),F \u2208 DIK0 . By the induction hypothesis, T |= ran(s) u F v D0. Thus, K |= C0(a), as required.\nNow assume xC,D \u2208 CIK0 . There exists xran(s),F with T |= C uD v \u2203s.F , s vT r and xran(s),F \u2208 DIK0 . By the induction hypothesis, T |= ran(s) u F v D0. Thus T |= C uD v \u2203r.D0, as required.\nWe now prove Point 3 for concepts of the form C0 = ran(r). Assume K |= (ran(r))(a). Then there exist b and s with s(b, a) \u2208 A and s vT r. But then a \u2208 ran(r)IK . Conversely,\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nassume that a \u2208 ran(r)IK . Then, by definition of IK, there exist b and s with s(b, a) \u2208 A and s vT r. Hence K |= (ran(r))(a), as required.\nAssume T |= C u D v ran(r). Then we have, for C = ran(s), s vT r. Then xC,D \u2208 ran(r)IK since there is a path in WK with tail xC,D. The converse direction is similar.\nIt follows from what has been proved so far that IK is a model of (T ,A). Thus we have proved Point 1, and it remains to prove Point 3.\nWe prove Point 3 for arbitrary Cu,u-concepts C0. The interesting step is for C0 = \u2203S.D0, where S = r1 u \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 u rn.\nAssume first that K |= C0(a). Then a \u2208 CIK0 since IK is a model of K. Similarly, if T |= C uD v C0, then xC,D \u2208 CIK0 since xC,D \u2208 (C uD)IK and IK is a model of T .\nConversely, assume that a \u2208 CIK0 . There exists d \u2208 \u2206IK such that (aIK , d) \u2208 SIK and d \u2208 DIK0 . Assume first that d = b \u2208 obj(A). By the induction hypothesis, K |= D0(b). For every ri, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, there exists si with si(a, b) \u2208 A and si vT ri. Thus, K |= C0(a), as required.\nAssume now that d = xran(s),F . Then K |= \u2203s.F (a), s vT ri for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n and xran(s),F \u2208 DIK0 . By the induction hypothesis, T |= ran(s) u F v D0. Thus, K |= C0(a), as required.\nNow assume xC,D \u2208 CIK0 . There exists xran(s),F with T |= C u D v \u2203s.F , s vT ri, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and xran(s),F \u2208 DIK0 . By the induction hypothesis, T |= ran(s) u F v D0. Thus T |= C uD v \u2203S.D0, as required."}, {"heading": "Appendix B. Proofs for Section 5", "text": "In some proofs, we require models for infinite sets of concepts.

We prove Point 1. For the direction from right to left observe that A |= Cn,ranA,a0 (a0) for all n \u2265 0. Thus, T |= Cn,ranA,a0 v D0 implies (T ,A) |= D0(a0).\nNow assume (T ,A) |= D0(a0). We show that T \u222aCranA,a0 |= D0. Then, using compactness, we find an n \u2265 0 such that T |= Cn,ranA,a0 v D0, as required.\nAssume T \u222a CranA,a0 6|= D0.

Such models exist by Lemma 67. We may assume that they are mutually disjoint.

For all Cran-concepts C and all a \u2208 obj(A) the following holds for all d \u2208 \u2206Ia :\nd \u2208 CIa iff d \u2208 CI .\nThe proof is by induction on the construction of C. The interesting cases are C = ran(r) and C = \u2203r.D and the direction from right to left.\nLet d \u2208 CI and assume first that C = ran(r). Let d \u2208 CI \u2229\u2206Ia and (d\u2032, d) \u2208 rI . For (d\u2032, d) \u2208 \u22c3 a\u2208obj(A) r Ia , the claim follows from the definition. Otherwise, d = da, d \u2032 = db for some b with r\u2032(b, a) \u2208 A and r\u2032 vT r. Thus, ran(r\u2032) \u2208 Cn,ranA,a for every n \u2265 0. Hence, T \u222a CranA,a |= ran(r) and we obtain d \u2208 CIa .\nAssume now that C = \u2203r.D and d \u2208 CI \u2229\u2206Ia . Take d\u2032 with (d, d\u2032) \u2208 rI and d\u2032 \u2208 DI . For (d, d\u2032) \u2208 \u22c3 a\u2032\u2208obj(A) r\nIa\u2032 , d \u2208 CIa follows immediately from the induction hypothesis. Otherwise, d = da and d \u2032 = db for some b with r \u2032(a, b) \u2208 A and r\u2032 vT r. By the induction hypothesis, d\u2032 \u2208 DIb . Hence, T \u222aCranA,b |= D. By compactness, there exists a concept E \u2208 CranA,b such that T |= E v D. From r\u2032(a, b) \u2208 A, we obtain \u2203r\u2032.E \u2208 Cn,ranA,a for every n > 0. But then, T \u222a CranA,a |= \u2203r\u2032.D and we obtain da \u2208 CIa using r\u2032 vT r. This finishes the proof of the claim.\nNow, for C v D \u2208 T , let d \u2208 \u2206I with d \u2208 CI , i.e. d \u2208 \u2206Ia for some a \u2208 obj(A). By Claim 1 we have d \u2208 CIa , which implies that d \u2208 DIa as CIa \u2286 DIa . We can conclude that d \u2208 DI by applying Claim 1 again. Similarly, one can show that CI = DI for every C \u2261 D \u2208 T and rI \u2286 sI for every r v s \u2208 T . It follows that I is a model of T . By construction of I, we have (aI , bI) \u2208 rI for every r(a, b) \u2208 A. Moreover, for A(a) \u2208 A with a \u2208 obj(A), it holds that T \u222a CranA,a |= A, which implies that da \u2208 AIa and aI \u2208 AI by our claim. We can thus infer that I is a model of (T ,A) and I 6|= D0(a0) as T \u222a CranA,a0 6|= D0, which implies that da0 6\u2208 D Ia0 0 and a I 0 6\u2208 DI0 , by Claim 1. Hence, (T ,A) 6|= D0(a0) and we have derived a contradiction. The proof of Point 2 is a simple application of the definition.\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nNow we prove cut elimination, correctness, and completeness of the calculus for ELHr given in Figures 1 and 5. We start with some basic observations, which can be easily proved by induction on the length of derivations.\nLemma 68.

For any ELHr-terminology T , Cran-concepts C, D, and E, if T ` C v D and T ` D v E then T ` C v E.\nProof. Let D1 be the derivation of C v D and D2 be the derivation of D v E. Let Li be the length of Di, i = 1, 2. The proof of the lemma is by induction on the lexicographical ordering on pairs (L2, L1).\nThe case when L2 = 0 or L1 = 0, as well as the cases when L2 ends with one of AndL1, AndL2, AndR, Ex, DefL, DefR or PDefL are virtually the same as in the proof of Hofmann (2005). Assume D2 ends with Dom, and so its last sequent is of the form \u2203r.D\u2032 v E, and the sequent above it is B v E. By Lemma 68, Item 4, T ` C v \u2203r.D\u2032 implies T ` C v B, so by the induction hypothesis, T ` C v E.\nThe cases when D2 ends with ExRan, Ran, Sub, or RanSub can be dealt with in the similar way using Lemma 68, Items 3, 5\u20137.\nTheorem 38. Let T be an ELHr-terminology; C0 and D0 be Cran-concepts. Then T |= C0 v D0 if, and only if, T ` C0 v D0.\nProof. It can be easily checked that the proof system rules are sound and so if T ` C0 v D0, then T |= C0 v D0.\nConversely, assume that T |= C0 v D0. To prove T ` C0 v D0 we construct an interpretation I based on the derivability of sequents from T . We show that I is a model of T . As a consequence we obtain CI0 \u2286 DI0 and conclude that T ` C0 v D0 based on the properties of I.\nThe domain \u2206I is the set of all well-formed pairs x = \u3008C,RC\u3009, where C is a Cran-concept and RC is a finite set of role names such that\n\u2200s \u2208 NR : if T ` (C u l\nr\u2208RC\nran(r)) v ran(s), then s \u2208 RC .\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nWe introduce the following abbreviation. Let\nRan(RC) = l\nr\u2208RC\nran(r).\nCran-concepts C are interpreted as\nI(C) = {\u3008D,RD\u3009 \u2208 \u2206I | T ` (D u Ran(RD)) v C},\nand r \u2208 NR are interpreted as\nI(r) = {(\u3008C,RC\u3009 , \u3008D,RD\u3009) \u2208 \u2206I \u00d7\u2206I | r \u2208 RD and T ` (C u Ran(RC)) v \u2203r.(D u Ran(RD))}.\nNote that I(C) is nonempty for every C: consider R0C = {s \u2208 NR | T ` C v ran(s)}. As T is finite, R0C is finite. Notice that, by Ax and AndR, T ` C v C u Ran(R0C) so, by Lemma 69, if T ` (Cu\nd r\u2208R0C\nran(r)) v ran(s), for some s, then T ` C v ran(s), so s \u2208 R0C . That is, \u2329 C,R0C \u232a is a well-formed pair and, obviously, \u2329 C,R0C \u232a \u2208 I(C).\nWe now show that I(C) = CI for all Cran-concepts C. The proof is by induction on the construction of C. 1. I(>) = \u2206I . For any well-formed pair \u3008C,RC\u3009, T ` C u Ran(RC) v > is an axiom. 2. I(C uD) = I(C) \u2229 I(D). Let \u3008C,RC\u3009 \u2208 I(D1uD2), that is T ` (C uRan(RC)) v (D1uD2). Since T ` (D1uD2) v D1, by Lemma 69, we have T ` (C u Ran(RC)) v D1, that is, \u3008C,RC\u3009 \u2208 I(D1). Similarly, \u3008C,RC\u3009 \u2208 I(D2).\nConversely, suppose \u3008C,RC\u3009 \u2208 I(D1) and \u3008C,RC\u3009 \u2208 I(D2) holds, that is, T ` (C u Ran(RC)) v D1 and T ` (CuRan(RC)) v D2. By AndR, T ` (CuRan(RC)) v (D1uD2), that is, \u3008C,RC\u3009 \u2208 I(D1 uD2). 3. I(\u2203r.C) = {x \u2208 \u2206I | \u2203y \u2208 I(C) : (x, y) \u2208 I(r)}. Suppose for some well-formed pair \u3008D,RD\u3009 we have \u3008D,RD\u3009 \u2208 I(\u2203r.C), that is T ` (DuRan(RD)) v \u2203r.C. Then, by Lemma 68, Item 3, T ` (DuRan(RD)) v \u2203r.(Cu ran(r)). Consider RrC = {s \u2208 NR | T ` (C u ran(r)) v ran(s)}. Clearly, r \u2208 RrC and, similarly to the argument for R0C above, \u3008C,RrC\u3009 is a well-formed pair. By Ax and AndR, T ` Curan(r) v CuRan(RrC), by Ex, T ` \u2203r.(Curan(r)) v \u2203r.(CuRan(RrC)) and by Lemma 69, T ` (D u Ran(RD)) v \u2203r.(C u Ran(RrC)). Then, by definition, (\u3008D,RD\u3009 , \u3008C,RrC\u3009) \u2208 I(r) and, since T ` (C u Ran(RrC)) v C, we have \u3008C,RrC\u3009 \u2208 I(C).\nConversely, let (\u3008D1,RD1\u3009 , \u3008D2,RD2\u3009) \u2208 I(r) and \u3008D2,RD2\u3009 \u2208 I(C), that is, T ` (D1u Ran(RD1)) v \u2203r.(D2uRan(RD2)), r \u2208 RD2 , and T ` (D2uRan(RD2)) v C. By Ex we have T ` \u2203r.(D2uRan(RD2)) v \u2203r.C, and, by Lemma 69, we have T ` (D1uRan(RD1)) v \u2203r.C, that is, \u3008D1,RD1\u3009 \u2208 I(\u2203r.C). 4. I(ran(r)) = {y \u2208 \u2206I | \u2203x : (x, y) \u2208 I(r)}. First we show that I(ran(r)) = {\u3008C,RC\u3009 \u2208 \u2206I | r \u2208 RC}. If r \u2208 RC , we have T ` C u Ran(RC) v ran(r), that is, I(ran(r)) \u2287 {\u3008C,RC\u3009 \u2208 \u2206I | r \u2208 RC}. Suppose \u3008C,RC\u3009 \u2208 I(ran(r)), that is, T ` (C u Ran(RC)) v ran(r). Then, since \u3008C,RC\u3009 is a well-formed pair, r \u2208 RC , that is, I(ran(r)) \u2286 {\u3008C,RC\u3009 \u2208 \u2206I | r \u2208 RC}.\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nSuppose now that \u3008C,RC\u3009 \u2208 I(ran(r)), that is, \u3008C,RC\u3009 is such that r \u2208 RC . Let D denote (CuRan(RC)). By induction on the length of derivations one can see that a sequent of the form \u2203r.D v ran(s) is not derivable for any s \u2208 NR. Therefore, \u3008\u2203r.D, \u2205\u3009 is a wellformed pair and (\u3008\u2203r.D, \u2205\u3009 , \u3008C,RC\u3009) \u2208 I(r). Conversely, let (\u3008D1,RD1\u3009 , \u3008D2,RD2\u3009) \u2208 I(r) then, in particular, r \u2208 RD2 . That is, \u3008D2,RD2\u3009 \u2208 I(ran(r)).\nNow we show that I is a model of T . We need to show that all axioms of T are true in I. 1. I(X) \u2286 I(CX), whenever X \u2261 CX \u2208 T or X v CX \u2208 T . Let \u3008C,RC\u3009 \u2208 I(X), that is, T ` (C u Ran(RC)) v X. By Lemma 68, Item 2, T ` (C u Ran(RC)) v CX , that is, \u3008C,RC\u3009 \u2208 I(CX). 2. I(CX) \u2286 I(X), whenever X \u2261 CX \u2208 T . Let \u3008C,RC\u3009 \u2208 I(CX), that is, T ` (C u Ran(RC)) v CX . Since by Ax and DefR T ` CX v X, by Lemma 69, T ` (C u Ran(RC)) v X, that is \u3008C,RC\u3009 \u2208 I(X). 3. (x, y) \u2208 I(r)\u21d2 y \u2208 I(A), whenever ran(r) v A \u2208 T . Let (\u3008C,RC\u3009 , \u3008D,RD\u3009) \u2208 I(r), that is, T ` (C u Ran(RC)) v \u2203r.(D u Ran(RD)) and r \u2208 RD. Since r \u2208 RD and, as, by Ax and Ran, T ` ran(r) v A, by AndL1, AndL2 we have T ` (D u Ran(RD)) v A, that is, \u3008D,RD\u3009 \u2208 I(A). 4. (x, y) \u2208 I(r)\u21d2 x \u2208 I(B), whenever \u2203r.> v B \u2208 T . Let (\u3008C,RC\u3009 , \u3008D,RD\u3009) \u2208 I(r), that is, T ` (C u Ran(RC)) v \u2203r.(D u Ran(RD)) and r \u2208 RD. Notice that, by Lemma 68, Item 4, we have T ` (C u Ran(RC)) v B, that is, \u3008C,RC\u3009 \u2208 I(B). 5. I(s) \u2286 I(r), whenever s v r \u2208 T . Let (\u3008C,RC\u3009 , \u3008D,RD\u3009 \u2208 I(r)), that is T ` (CuRan(RC)) v \u2203r.(DuRan(RD)) and r \u2208 RD. By Lemma 68, Item 6, T ` (C u Ran(RC)) v \u2203s.(D u Ran(RD)). Since r v s \u2208 T , by Ax and RanSub, T ` ran(r) v ran(s) and T ` (D u Ran(RD)) v ran(s) by AndL1 and AndL2. Since \u3008D,RD\u3009 is well-formed, s \u2208 RD. Thus, (\u3008C,RC\u3009 , \u3008D,RD\u3009) \u2208 I(s)\nAs T |= C0 v D0, we have I(C0) \u2286 I(D0). Since \u2329 C0,R0C0 \u232a \u2208 I(C0), we have\u2329\nC0,R0C0 \u232a \u2208 I(D0), that is T ` (C0 u Ran(R0C0)) v D0. As T ` C0 v C0 u Ran(R 0 C0\n), we have T ` C0 v D0 by Lemma 69.\nProof of Lemma 44. Let T be a normalised ELHr-terminology and \u03a3 a signature. Additionally, let A be a \u03a3-ABox, A \u2208 sig(T ) \u222a \u03a3 non-conjunctive in T and a \u2208 obj(A).\nFor the direction \u201c(1.) \u21d2 (2.)\u201d, it is a direct consequence of the construction of AT ,\u03a3 that for all b \u2208 obj(A) and B \u2208 sig(T ) \u222a \u03a3 non-conjunctive in T if (T ,A) 6|= B(b) then \u03beB \u2208 obj(AT ,\u03a3). Assume that (T ,A) 6|= A(a). Then \u03beA \u2208 obj(AT ,\u03a3). We now define a \u03a3-range simulation S by setting,\n\u2022 for b \u2208 obj(A) and for B \u2208 sig(T ) \u222a \u03a3 non-conjunctive in T with \u03beB \u2208 obj(AT ,\u03a3) : (b, \u03beB) \u2208 S if, and only if, (T ,A) 6|= B(b),\n\u2022 (b, \u03be\u03a3) \u2208 S for all b \u2208 obj(A).\nWe show that S is indeed a \u03a3-range simulation with (a, \u03beA) \u2208 S by verifying that the conditions (S1)\u2013(S3) and (RS) introduced on page 663 hold.\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\n(S1) As (T ,A) 6|= A(a) and \u03beA \u2208 obj(AT ,\u03a3), it immediately follows that (a, \u03beA) \u2208 S.\n(S2) Let now (b, \u03be) \u2208 S and B\u0303(b) \u2208 A with B\u0303 \u2208 \u03a3. We have to prove that B\u0303(\u03be) \u2208 AT ,\u03a3. For \u03be = \u03beB with B \u2208 sig(T ) \u222a \u03a3 non-conjunctive in T , we obtain from the definition of S that (T ,A) 6|= B(b). Moreover, it holds that B\u0303 6\u2208 preC\u03a3T (B) as otherwise (T ,A) |= B(b). Thus, by the definition of AT ,\u03a3(B) we have B\u0303(\u03beB) \u2208 AT ,\u03a3. For \u03be = \u03be\u03a3, it immediately follows that B\u0303(\u03be\u03a3) \u2208 AT ,\u03a3 by the definition of AT ,\u03a3.\n(S3) Now, let (b, \u03be) \u2208 S and r(b, b\u2032) \u2208 A with r \u2208 \u03a3. We have to prove that there exists \u03be\u2032 \u2208 obj(AT ,\u03a3) with (b\u2032, \u03be\u2032) \u2208 S and r(\u03be, \u03be\u2032) \u2208 AT ,\u03a3. For \u03be = \u03be\u03a3, it immediately follows from the definition of AT ,\u03a3 that r(\u03be\u03a3, \u03be\u03a3) \u2208 AT ,\u03a3 and (b\u2032, \u03be\u03a3) \u2208 S holds by the definition of S.\nFor \u03be = \u03beB with B \u2208 sig(T ) \u222a \u03a3 non-conjunctive in T it follows from the definition of S that (T ,A) 6|= B(b). Additionally, we can infer that r 6\u2208 preDom\u03a3T (B) as otherwise (T ,A) |= (\u2203r.>)(b) would imply that (T ,A) |= B(b).\nConsider cases how B is defined in T . If B is pseudo-primitive in T , we obtain from the definition of AT ,\u03a3(B) that r(\u03beB, \u03be\u03a3) \u2208 AT ,\u03a3 and it holds that (b\u2032, \u03be\u03a3) \u2208 S by the definition of S.\nFor B \u2261 \u2203r\u2032.B\u2032 \u2208 T , we have to distinguish between the following two cases. If r 6\u2208 preRole\u03a3T (r\n\u2032), we obtain r \u2208 \u03a3 \\ (preRole\u03a3T (r\u2032) \u222a preDom\u03a3T (B)) and thus r(\u03beB, \u03be\u03a3) \u2208 AT ,\u03a3 by the definition of AT ,\u03a3 and it holds again that (b\u2032, \u03be\u03a3) \u2208 S by the definition of S. In the case where r \u2208 preRole\u03a3T (r\u2032), we have r \u2208 preRole\u03a3T (r\u2032) \\ preDom\u03a3T (B). Furthermore, as (T ,A) 6|= B(b) and so (T ,A) 6|= (\u2203r\u2032.B\u2032)(b), it is easy to see that there must exist B\u2032\u2032i \u2208 non-conjT (B\u2032) with r 6\u2208 preRan\u03a3T (B\u2032\u2032i ) and (T ,A) 6|= B\u2032\u2032i (b\u2032). Then we have r(\u03beB, \u03beB\u2032\u2032i ) \u2208 AT ,\u03a3 by the definition of AT ,\u03a3(B) and (b\u2032, \u03beB\u2032\u2032i ) \u2208 S by the definition of S.\n(RS) Let now (b, \u03be) \u2208 S such that r(c, b) \u2208 A for r \u2208 \u03a3. We have to show that there exists \u03be\u2032 with r(\u03be\u2032, \u03be) \u2208 AT ,\u03a3. For \u03be = \u03beB with B \u2208 sig(T ) \u222a \u03a3 non-conjunctive in T , we obtain again from the definition of S that (T ,A) 6|= B(b). Furthermore, we have r 6\u2208 preRan\u03a3T (B) as otherwise (T ,A) |= B(b). Thus, by the definition of AT ,\u03a3(B) we have r(\u03be\u03a3, \u03beB) \u2208 AT ,\u03a3. For \u03be = \u03be\u03a3, it follows by the definition of AT ,\u03a3 that r(\u03be\u03a3, \u03be\u03a3) \u2208 AT ,\u03a3.\nFor the converse direction \u201c(2.) \u21d2 (1.)\u201d, we assume that \u03beA \u2208 obj(AT ,\u03a3) and (A, a) \u2264ran\u03a3 (AT ,\u03a3, \u03beA). It is then sufficient to show for all n that\nT 6|= Cn,ranAT ,\u03a3,\u03beA v A\nas this implies that (T ,AT ,\u03a3) 6|= A(\u03beA) by Lemma 36. We then obtain from Lemma 42 that (T ,A) 6|= A(a) holds.\nThus, we now prove by induction on n that for every concept name B \u2208 sig(T ) \u222a \u03a3 non-conjunctive in T with \u03beB \u2208 obj(AT ,\u03a3), we have T 6|= Cn,ranAT ,\u03a3,\u03beB v B.\nLet n = 0 and B \u2208 sig(T )\u222a\u03a3 non-conjunctive in T with \u03beB \u2208 obj(AT ,\u03a3). It then follows that\nC0,ranAT ,\u03a3,\u03beB = l\nB\u2032\u2208\u03a3\\preC\u03a3T (B)\nB\u2032 u l\ns\u2208\u03a3\\preRan\u03a3T (B)\nran(s) u l\nA\u0303\u2261\u2203r\u0303.B\u0303\u2208T B\u2208non-conjT (B\u0303)\ns\u2208preRole\u03a3T (r\u0303)\\(preDom \u03a3 T (A\u0303)\u222apreRan \u03a3 T (B))\nran(s)\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nHence, one can see that for every subconcept of the form ran(s) that occurs in C0,ranAT ,\u03a3,\u03beB , we obtain that s 6\u2208 preRan\u03a3T (B). As B it non-conjunctive in T , it holds that either B is pseudo-primitive in T or that B \u2261 \u2203r\u2032.B\u2032 \u2208 T . Hence, by Lemma 39 we can conclude that T 6|= C0,ranAT ,\u03a3,\u03beB v B.\nFor n > 0, let again B \u2208 sig(T )\u222a\u03a3 non-conjunctive in T with \u03beB \u2208 obj(AT ,\u03a3).

Then, by (ii), we can conclude that one of the conditions (e1u), (e2u), (e3u), or (e4u) is satisfied as well.\nWe give the translation of Cu,u-assertions to conjunctive queries. It is similar to the construction of an ABox from a Cran-concept given in Section 5.1. First, given a Cu-concept C, we define a path in C as a finite sequence C0 \u00b7R1 \u00b7 C1 . . . Rn \u00b7 Cn, where C0 = C, n \u2265 0, and \u2203Ri+1.Ci+1 is a conjunct of Ci, for 1 \u2264 i < n (Ri are conjunctions of role names). Let xp for p \u2208 paths(C) be pairwise distinct variable names and set\nXC = { s(xp, xq) | p, q \u2208 paths(C); q = p \u00b7R \u00b7 C \u2032, s conjunct of R } \u222a {A(xp) | A is a conjunct of tail(p), p \u2208 paths(C) }\nLet ~x be the sequence of all variables in XC except xC . Then the conjunctive query qC,a is obtained from \u2203~x. \u2227 \u03d5\u2208XC \u03d5 by replacing xC with a. Finally, for D = D0u\u2203u.D1u\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7u\u2203u.Dk\nwe obtain the conjunctive query qD,a from \u2203~x.( \u2227 0\u2264i\u2264k \u2227 \u03d5\u2208XDi \u03d5), (we assume that distinct variables are used in every XDi , 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k, and that ~x is a sequence of all variables except xD0) by replacing xD0 with a.\nTo prove Lemma 63 we require some preparation. Query answering is closely related to the existence of certain homomorphisms between interpretations. Let \u03a3 be a signature, O a set of individual names, and I1, I2 interpretations. A function f : \u2206I1 \u2192 \u2206I2 is called a (O,\u03a3)-homomorphism if\n\u2022 f(aI1) = f(aI2) for all a \u2208 O;\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\n\u2022 d \u2208 AI1 implies f(d) \u2208 AI2 for all A \u2208 \u03a3;\n\u2022 (d1, d2) \u2208 rI1 implies (f(d1), f(d2)) \u2208 rI2 for all r \u2208 \u03a3.\nIt is known (Chandra & Merlin, 1977) that if there exists a (O,\u03a3)-homomorphism from I1 to I2 and I1 |= q[~a] for a conjunctive \u03a3-query q using only individual names from O and ~a = a1, . . . , ak from O, then I2 |= q[~a].\nFor the proof below we slightly refine the notion of an (O,\u03a3)-homomorphism by considering partial (O,\u03a3)-homomorphisms with domains that satisfy certain conditions. Namely, for every n \u2265 0, we will call a partial (O,\u03a3)-homomorphism a level n homomorphism if its domain contains all elements reachable by a \u03a3-role chain of length at most n from either a named individual or from an element without a \u03a3-predecessor. We then prove that if for every ELran,u,u-inclusion C v D with depth(C), depth(D) \u2264 n, T1 |= C v D implies T2 |= C v D, then there exists a such a partial level n homomorphism from a certain model of (T1,A) to a certain model of (T2,A).\nWe consider such partial homomorphisms on certain interpretations only, which we introduce first. Let O be a finite set of individual names and I an interpretation. d \u2208 \u2206I is called O-named if there exists a \u2208 O with d = aI . A model I is called an O-forest if\n(F1) for every d \u2208 \u2206I which is not O-named, there exists at most one d\u2032 \u2208 \u2206I such that (d\u2032, d) \u2208 \u22c3 r\u2208NR r I ;\n(F2) there are no infinite sequences d0, d1, . . . with (di+1, di) \u2208 \u22c3 r\u2208NR r\nI for all i \u2265 0 such that no di is O-named.\n(F3) if (d, d\u2032) \u2208 \u22c3 r\u2208NR r I and d\u2032 is O-named, then d is O-named.\nLet O be a finite set of individual names, n \u2265 0, and \u03a3 a signature. A partial function f from an O-forest I to a model I \u2032 is called an (O,n,\u03a3)-homomorphism if\n(H1) for all a \u2208 O: aI is in the domain of f and f(aI) = aI\u2032 ;\n(H2) for all d, d\u2032 in the domain of f and r \u2208 \u03a3: (d, d\u2032) \u2208 rI implies (f(d), f(d\u2032)) \u2208 rI\u2032 ;\n(H3) for all d in the domain of f and A \u2208 \u03a3: d \u2208 AI implies f(d) \u2208 AI\u2032 ;\n(H4) for all d if there does not exist a chain d1, . . . , dm = d with (di, di+1) \u2208 \u22c3 r\u2208\u03a3 r\nI of length m > n of not O-named di, then d is in the domain of f .\nNow one can prove the following\nLemma 70. Suppose I is an O-forest, I \u2032 an interpretation and for every m > 0 there exists a (O,m,\u03a3)-homomorphism from I to I \u2032. Assume as well that I |= q[~a] with q a conjunctive \u03a3-query using only individual names from O and ~a = a1, . . . , ak from O. Then I \u2032 |= q[~a].\nProof. Assume that ~a is a \u03c0-match of I and q(~x) = \u2203~y.q\u2032(~x, ~y) such that ~a consists of elements of O. By (F2) and (F3) in the definition of O-forests and (H1) and (H4) in the definition of partial homomorphisms, there exists m > 0 such that all \u03c0(v), v from ~x \u222a ~y, are in the domain of any (O,m,\u03a3)-homomorphism f . Take a (O,m,\u03a3)-homomorphism f . Then ~a is a \u03c0\u2032-match of q(~x) and I \u2032, where \u03c0\u2032(v) = f(\u03c0(v)), for all v \u2208 ~x \u222a ~y.\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nFinally, we also need a technique for constructing (O,m,\u03a3)-homomorphisms. Let I be an interpretation. For each d \u2208 \u2206I and m > 0, let\ntm,\u03a3,uI (d) = {C \u2208 C u \u03a3 | depth(C) \u2264 m, d \u2208 CI},\nwhere, as above, depth(C) is the role-depth of C; i.e., the number of nestings of existential restrictions in C.\nLemma 71. Let \u03a3 be a finite signature and let m > 0 Suppose I is an O-forest and I \u2032 an interpretation such that\n(in0) (aI , bI) \u2208 rI implies (aI\u2032 , bI\u2032) \u2208 rI\u2032, for all a, b \u2208 O and r \u2208 \u03a3;\n(in1) tm,\u03a3,uI (a I) \u2286 tm,\u03a3,uI\u2032 (a I\u2032), for all a \u2208 O;\n(in2) for all d \u2208 \u2206I there exists d\u2032 \u2208 \u2206I\u2032 such that tm,\u03a3,uI (d) \u2286 t m,\u03a3,u I\u2032 (d \u2032);\nThen there exists a (O,m,\u03a3)-homomorphism g from I to I \u2032.\nProof. We construct g by constructing a sequence of functions f0, . . . , fm, where fi : I \u2192 I \u2032, as follows: the domain dom(f0) of f0 consists of all a\nI with a \u2208 O and all d \u2208 \u2206I such that there does not exist a d\u2032 with (d\u2032, d) \u2208 \u22c3 r\u2208\u03a3 r I . For aI with a \u2208 O we set f0(aI) = aI \u2032 . For every remaining d \u2208 dom(f0) choose a d\u2032 according to (in2) and set f0(d) = d\u2032. Observe that tm,\u03a3,uI (d) \u2286 t m,\u03a3,u I\u2032 (f0(d)) for all d \u2208 dom(f0).\nNow suppose that fn has been constructed and\n(in3) tm\u2212n,\u03a3,uI (d) \u2286 t m\u2212n,\u03a3,u I\u2032 (fn(d)) for all d \u2208 dom(fn);\n(in4) for n > 0: d \u2208 dom(fn) if, and only if, d is not O-named and there exists a sequence d0r I 1 d1r I 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 rIndn = d of which at most d0 is O-named such that ri \u2208 \u03a3 and d0 \u2208\ndom(f0). To construct fn+1 consider a d \u2208 dom(fn) and a not O-named d\u2032 such that (d, d\u2032) \u2208 \u22c3 r\u2208\u03a3 r\nI . The domain of fn+1 consists of all such d\n\u2032. Let Rd,d\u2032 = {r \u2208 \u03a3 | (d, d\u2032) \u2208 rI} and Rud,d\u2032 = ( d r\u2208Rd,d\u2032 r). Then\n\u2203Rud,d\u2032 . l\nD\u2208tm\u2212n\u22121,\u03a3,uI (d\u2032)\nD \u2208 tm\u2212n,\u03a3,uI (d)\nBy (in3),\n\u2203Rud,d\u2032 . l\nD\u2208tm\u2212n\u22121,\u03a3,uI (d\u2032)\nD \u2208 tm\u2212n,\u03a3,uI\u2032 (fn(d))\nThus, we can choose an e with (fn(d), e) \u2208 rI \u2032 for all r \u2208 Rd,d\u2032 and tm\u2212n\u22121,\u03a3,uI (d\u2032) \u2286 tm\u2212n\u22121,\u03a3,uI\u2032 (e) and set fn+1(d\n\u2032) = e. This defines fn+1. Observe further that fn+1 is welldefined by (F1). Observe that fn+1 has the properties (in3) and (in4), by (F3).\nNow we set g = \u22c3\n0\u2264n\u2264m fm. It is readily checked that g is as required.\nKonev, Ludwig, Walther, & Wolter\nWe are now in the position to prove Lemma 63.\nLemma 63 If \u03d5 \u2208 qDiff\u03a3(T1, T2), then there exists \u03d5\u2032 \u2208 cDiff ran,u,u \u03a3 (T1, T2) with sig(\u03d5\u2032) \u2286 sig(\u03d5).\nProof. Assume T1 and T2 are given and let (A, q(~a)) \u2208 qDiff\u03a3(T1, T2). Let \u03a3\u2032 = sig(A) \u222a sig(q). Assume that, in contrast to what is to be shown,\n(\u2217) T1 |= \u03b1 \u21d2 T2 |= \u03b1\nfor all ELran,u,u-inclusions \u03b1 with sig(\u03b1) \u2286 \u03a3\u2032. Consider a model I \u2032 of (T2,A) with I \u2032 6|= q[~a]. By Lemma 70, we obtain a contradiction if there exists an obj(A)-forest I which is a model of (T1,A) and such that for every n > 0 there exists an (obj(A), n,\u03a3\u2032)-homomorphism fn from I to I \u2032.\nTake, for every a \u2208 obj(A) a model I \u2032a of T1 with da \u2208 \u2206I \u2032 a such that for all Cran \u222a Cu,u-\nconcepts C: da \u2208 CI \u2032 a \u21d4 T1 \u222a tI\u2032(a) |= C\nwhere tI\u2032(a) = {C \u2208 Cran\u03a3\u2032 | aI \u2032 \u2208 CI\u2032}.\nSuch interpretations I \u2032a exist by Lemma 67. We now define the unfolding Ia of I \u2032a. A path in I \u2032a is a finite sequence d0R1d1 . . . Rndn, n \u2265 0, such that Ri+1 = d Ri+1 for a set Ri+1 of role names with r \u2208 Ri+1 iff (di, di+1) \u2208 rI \u2032 a , for all i < n. For a path p, tail(p) denotes the last element of p. Now let \u2206Ia consist of all paths in I \u2032a and set\n\u2022 AIa = {p \u2208 \u2206Ia | tail(p) \u2208 AI\u2032a};\n\u2022 rIa = {(d, dRd\u2032) \u2208 \u2206Ia \u00d7\u2206Ia | r \u2208 R}.\nThen Ia is an O-forest for O = \u2205. Moreover, for all Cu,u-concepts C and all p \u2208 Ia:\n(\u2217\u2217) p \u2208 CIa \u21d4 tail(p) \u2208 CI\u2032a .\nIn particular, Ia is still a model of T1. Take the following (disjoint) union I of the interpretations Ia:\n\u2022 \u2206I = \u22c3 a\u2208obj(A) \u2206 Ia ;\n\u2022 AI = \u22c3 a\u2208obj(A)A Ia , for A \u2208 NC;\n\u2022 rI = \u22c3 a\u2208obj(A) r Ia \u222a {(da, db) | r\u2032(a, b) \u2208 A, r\u2032 vT1 r}, for r \u2208 NR;\n\u2022 aI = da, for a \u2208 obj(A).\nWe show that I is an obj(A)-forest, a model of (T1,A) and that there exist (obj(A), n,\u03a3)homomorphisms from I to I \u2032 for all n > 0. First observe the following:\nClaim 1. For all EL concepts C and d \u2208 \u2206Ia :\nd \u2208 CI \u21d4 d \u2208 CIa\nThe Logical Difference for the Lightweight Description Logic EL\nThe proof is by induction on the construction of C. The interesting case is C = \u2203r.D and the direction from left to right. Assume that d \u2208 CI \u2229 \u2206Ia . Take d\u2032 with (d, d\u2032) \u2208 rI and d\u2032 \u2208 DI . For (d, d\u2032) \u2208 \u22c3 a\u2032\u2208obj(A) r\nIa\u2032 , d \u2208 CIa follows immediately from the induction hypothesis. Otherwise, d = da, d \u2032 = db for some b with r \u2032(a, b) \u2208 A and r\u2032 vT1 r. By the induction hypothesis, d\u2032 \u2208 DIb . Hence, by (\u2217\u2217), T1 \u222a tI\u2032(b) |= D. By compactness, there exists a concept E \u2208 tI\u2032(b) such that T1 |= E v D. We obtain \u2203r\u2032.E \u2208 tI\u2032(a). But then T1 |= \u2203r\u2032.E v \u2203r\u2032.D and we obtain da \u2208 CIa using r\u2032 vT1 r and (\u2217\u2217).\nClaim 2. I is an obj(A)-forest and a model of (T1,A).\nThat I is an obj(A)-forest and a model of A follows from the construction. It remains to show that I is a model of T1. For role inclusions r v s \u2208 T1 it follows from the construction that rI \u2286 sI . Suppose C1 v C2 \u2208 T1. If C1 is an EL-concept, then I |= C1 v C2 follows from Claim 1 and the condition that the Ia are models of T1. Now assume that C1 = ran(r) and let d \u2208 ran(r)I . If d 6= da for any a, then d \u2208 CI2 since the Ia are models of T1. If d = da, there exists r\u2032(b, a) \u2208 A with r\u2032 vT1 r. We have ran(r\u2032) \u2208 tI\u2032(a), and so T1 \u222a tI\u2032(a) |= C2. Hence, by (\u2217\u2217), da \u2208 CIa2 , i.e. da \u2208 CI2 by Claim 1.\nClaim 3. For every n > 0 there exists an (obj(A), n,\u03a3\u2032)-homomorphism from I to I \u2032.\nBy Lemma 71, it is sufficient to show conditions (in0), (in1), and (in2). Condition (in0) follows directly from (\u2217). Condition (in1) is proved by induction on the construction of C. The interesting step is for C = \u2203S.D with S = r1 u \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 u rm. Let a \u2208 obj(A) and C \u2208 tn,\u03a3\n\u2032,u I (a I). Take d\u2032 with (aI , d\u2032) \u2208 SI and d\u2032 \u2208 DI . If d\u2032 \u2208 \u2206Ia , then, by (\u2217\u2217), T1\u222a tI\u2032(a) |= \u2203S.D. By (\u2217) and compactness, T2 \u222a tI\u2032(a) |= \u2203S.D. Hence C \u2208 tn,\u03a3 \u2032,u I\u2032 (a\nI\u2032). Now assume d\u2032 6\u2208 \u2206Ia . Then there are r\u20321, . . . , r\u2032k and b with d\u2032 = bI such that r\u2032i(a, b) \u2208 A for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k and for every 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m there exists an 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m with r\u2032j vT1 ri. We have D \u2208 t n,\u03a3\u2032,u I (b I). By the induction hypothesis D \u2208 tn,\u03a3 \u2032,u\nI\u2032 (b I\u2032). By (\u2217), for every 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m there exists an\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 k with r\u2032j vT2 ri. But then C \u2208 t n,\u03a3\u2032,u I\u2032 (a I\u2032), as required.\nFor (in2), let d \u2208 \u2206I and C = d D\u2208tn,\u03a3\n\u2032,u I (d) D. If d 6= aI for any a \u2208 obj(A), then by (\u2217\u2217) there exists b \u2208 obj(A) such that T1 \u222a tI\u2032(b) |= \u2203u.C. By compactness and (\u2217), T2 \u222a tI\u2032(b) |= \u2203u.C. Hence, there exists d\u2032 \u2208 \u2206I \u2032 with tn,\u03a3 \u2032,u I (d) \u2286 t n,\u03a3\u2032,u I\u2032 (d \u2032), as required. If d = aI for some a \u2208 obj(A), then, by (in1) shown above, d\u2032 = aI\u2032 is as required.
