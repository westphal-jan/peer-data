Although these approaches have shown promise, several issues related to human language behavior and human-machine conversation have not been addressed. First, psycholinguistic studies have shown certain temporal regularities between human eye movement and language production. While these regularities can potentially guide the acquisition process, they have not been incorporated in the previous unsupervised approaches. Second, conversational systems generally have an existing knowledge base about the domain and vocabulary. While the existing knowledge can potentially help bootstrap and constrain the acquired new words, it has not been incorporated in the previous models. Third, eye gaze could serve different functions in human-machine conversation. Some gaze streams may not be closely coupled with speech stream, and thus are potentially detrimental to word acquisition. Automated recognition of closely-coupled speech-gaze streams based on conversation context is important. To address these issues, we developed new approaches that incorporate user language behavior, domain knowledge, and conversation context in word acquisition. We evaluated these approaches in the context of situated dialogue in a virtual world. Our experimental results have shown that incorporating the above three types of contextual information significantly improves word acquisition performance. Third, speech stream recognition improves word acquisition performance in the absence of an intersubjective, context-dependent approach. First, our attention and attention were reduced due to the presence of a temporal regularity (i.e., the level of focus, the number of words, the time required to engage), and to language acquisition in the absence of an intersubjective, context-dependent approach. Second, we tested that both attention and attention were improved over the presence of a temporal regularity (i.e., the amount of focus, the number of words, the number of words, and the number of words, respectively) during the intersubjective interaction. Third, our results demonstrate that both attention and attention were positively associated with both attention and attention in the absence of an intersubjective, context-dependent approach, as well as both attention and attention. The effects of the presence of a temporal regularity on word acquisition performance on nonverbal recognition are well understood. The presence of a temporal regularity is also considered the most common feature of the human eye. In the current study, we showed that a temporal regularity is associated with learning to avoid eye gaze.

Introduction", "text": "One major bottleneck in human machine conversation is robust language interpretation. When the encountered vocabulary is outside of the system\u2019s knowledge, the system tends to fail. As conversational interfaces have become increasingly important in many applications such as remote interaction with robots (Lemon, Gruenstein, & Peters, 2002; Fong & Nourbakhsh, 2005) and automated training and education (Traum & Rickel, 2002), the ability to automatically acquire new words during online conversation becomes essential. Different from traditional telephony-based spoken dialogue systems, in conversational interfaces users can look at a graphic display or a virtual world while interacting with artificial agents using natural speech. This unique setting provides an opportunity for automated vocabulary acquisition. During interaction, users\u2019 visual perception (e.g., as indicated by eye gaze) provides a potential channel for the system to automatically learn new words.\nc\u00a92010 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.\nThe idea, as shown in previous work (Yu & Ballard, 2004; Liu, Chai, & Jin, 2007), is that the parallel data of visual perception and spoken utterances can be used by unsupervised approaches to automatically identify the mappings between words and visual entities and thus acquire new words. While previous approaches provide a promising direction, they mainly rely on the co-occurrence between words and visual entities in a completely unsupervised manner. However, in human machine conversation, there are different types of extra information related to human language behaviors and characteristics of conversation systems. Although this extra information can potentially provide supervision to guide the word acquisition process and improve performance, it has not been systematically explored in previous work.\nFirst, a large body of psycholinguistic studies have shown that eye gaze is tightly linked to human language processing. This is evident in both language comprehension (Tanenhaus, Spivey-Knowiton, Eberhard, & Sedivy, 1995; Eberhard, Spivey-Knowiton, Sedivy, & Tanenhaus, 1995; Allopenna, Magnuson, & Tanenhaus, 1998; Dahan & Tanenhaus, 2005; Spivey, Tanenhaus, Eberhard, & Sedivy, 2002) and language production (Meyer, Sleiderink, & Levelt, 1998; Rayner, 1998; Griffin & Bock, 2000; Bock, Irwin, Davidson, & Leveltb, 2003; Brown-Schmidt & Tanenhaus, 2006; Griffin, 2001). Specifically in human language production, which is directly relevant to automated computer interpretation of human language, studies have found significant temporal regularities between the mentioned objects and the corresponding words (Meyer et al., 1998; Rayner, 1998; Griffin & Bock, 2000). In object naming tasks, the onset of a word begins approximately one second after a speaker has looked at the corresponding visual referent (Griffin, 2004), and gazes are longer the more difficult the name of the referent is to retrieve (Meyer et al., 1998; Griffin, 2001). About 100-300 ms after the articulation of the object name begins, the eyes move to the next object relevant to the task (Meyer et al., 1998). All these findings suggest that eyes move to the mentioned objects before the corresponding words are uttered. Although this language behavior can be used to constrain the mapping between words and visual objects, it has not been incorporated in the previous approaches.\nSecond, practical conversational systems always have existing knowledge about their application domains and vocabularies. This knowledge base is acquired at their development time: either authored by the domain experts or automatically learned from available data. Although the existing knowledge can be rather limited and is desired to be enhanced automatically online (e.g., through automated vocabulary acquisition), it provides important information about the structure of the domain and the existing vocabularies, which can further bootstrap and constrain new word acquisition. This type of domain knowledge has not been utilized in previous approaches.\nThird, although psycholinguistic studies provide us with a sound empirical basis for assuming that eye movements are predictive of speech, the gaze behavior in an interactive setting can be much more complex. There are different types of eye movements (Kahneman, 1973). The naturally occurring eye gaze during speech production may serve different functions, for example, to engage in the conversation or to manage turn taking (Nakano, Reinstein, Stocky, & Cassell, 2003). Furthermore, while interacting with a graphic display, a user could be talking about objects that were previously seen on the display or something completely unrelated to any object the user is looking at. Therefore using all the speechgaze pairs for word acquisition can be detrimental. The type of gaze that is mostly useful\nfor word acquisition is the kind that reflects the underlying attention and tightly links to the content of the co-occurring speech. Thus, automatically recognizing closely coupled speech and gaze streams during online conversation for word acquisition is important. However, it has not been examined in previous work.\nTo address the above three issues, we have developed new approaches to automatic word acquisition that (1) incorporate findings on user language behavior from psycholinguistic studies, in particular the temporal alignment between spoken words and eye gaze; (2) utilize the existing domain knowledge, and (3) automatically identify closely-coupled speech and gaze streams based on conversation context. We evaluated these approaches in the context of situated dialogue in a virtual world. Our experimental results have shown that incorporating the above three types of contextual information significantly improves word acquisition performance. Our simulation studies further demonstrate the effect of automatic online word acquisition on improving language understanding in human-machine conversation.\nIn the following sections, we first introduce the domain and data collection in our investigation. We then describe the enhanced models for word acquisition that incorporate additional contextual information (e.g., language behavior between spoken words and eye gaze, domain knowledge, conversation context). Finally, we present the empirical evaluation of our enhanced models and demonstrate the effect of online word acquisition on spoken language understanding during human-machine conversation."}, {"heading": "2. Related Work", "text": "Our work is motivated by previous work on grounded language acquisition and eye gaze in multimodal human-computer interaction.\nGrounded language acquisition is to learn the meaning of language by connecting the language to the perception of the world. Language acquisition by grounding words to the visual perceptions of objects has been studied in various language learning systems. For example, given speech paired with video images of single objects, mutual information between audio and visual signals was used to learn words by associating acoustic phoneme sequences with the visual prototypes (e.g., color, size, shape) of objects (Roy & Pentland, 2002; Roy, 2002). Generative models were developed to learn words by associating words with image regions given parallel data of pictures and description text (Barnard, Duygulu, de Freitas, Forsyth, Blei, & Jordan, 2003). Given pairs of spoken instructions containing object names and the corresponding objects, an utterance-object joint probability model was used to learn object names by identifying object name phonemes and associating them with the objects (Taguchi, Iwahashi, Nose, Funakoshi, & Nakano, 2009). Given sequences of utterances paired with scene representations, an incremental translation model was developed to learn word meaning by associating words with the semantic representations of the referents in the scene (Fazly, Alishahi, & Stevenson, 2008). In addition to grounding individual words, previous work has also investigated grounding phrases (referring expressions) to visual objects through semantic decomposition, for example using context free grammar that connects linguistic structures with underlying visual properties (Gorniak & Roy, 2004).\nBesides visual objects, approaches have also been developed to ground words to meaning representations of events. For example, event logic was applied to ground verbs to\nmotion events that were represented by force dynamics encoding the support, contact, and attachment relations between objects in video images (Siskind, 2001). In a video game domain, a translation model was used to ground words to the semantic roles of user actions (Fleischman & Roy, 2005). In a simulated Robocup soccer domain, given textual game commentaries paired with the symbolic descriptions of game events, approaches based on statistical parsing and learning were developed to ground the commentary text to game events (Chen & Mooney, 2008). In a less restricted data setting, generative models were developed to simultaneously segment the text into utterances and map the utterances to meaning representations of event states (Liang, Jordan, & Klein, 2009). Different from the above previous work, in our work, the visual perception is indicated by eye gaze. Eye gaze, on one hand, is indicative of human attention, which provides opportunities to link language and perception; on the other hand, is an implicit and subconscious input, which could bring additional challenge in word acquisition.\nEye gaze has long been explored in human-computer interaction for direct manipulation interfaces as a pointing device (Jacob, 1991; Wang, 1995; Zhai, Morimoto, & Ihde, 1999). Eye gaze as a modality in multimodal interaction goes beyond the function of pointing. In different speech and eye gaze systems, eye gaze has been explored for the purpose of mutual disambiguation (Tanaka, 1999; Zhang, Imamiya, Go, & Mao, 2004), as a complement to the speech channel for reference resolution (Campana, Baldridge, Dowding, Hockey, Remington, & Stone, 2001; Kaur, Termaine, Huang, Wilder, Gacovski, Flippo, & Mantravadi, 2003; Prasov & Chai, 2008; Byron, Mampilly, Sharma, & Xu, 2005) and speech recognition (Cooke, 2006; Qu & Chai, 2007), and for managing human-computer dialogue (Qvarfordt & Zhai, 2005).\nEye gaze has been explored recently for word acquisition. For example, Yu and Ballard (2004) proposed an embodied multimodal learning interface for word acquisition, especially through eye movement. In this work, given speech paired with eye gaze information and video images, a translation model was applied to acquire words by associating acoustic phone sequences with visual representations of objects and actions. This work has inspired our research and is mostly related to our effort here. The difference between our work and the work by Yu and Ballard lies in two aspects. First, the learning environment is different. While Yu and Ballard focuses on the narrative descriptions of actions (e.g., making a sandwich, pouring some drinks, etc.) from human subjects, our focus is on interactive conversation. In conversation, a human participant can take both a speaker role and an addressee role. This represents a new scenario where word acquisition based on eye movement may have new implications. Second, in the work by Yu and Ballard, the IBM Translation Model 1 was applied to word acquisition. In our work, we further incorporate other types of information such as user language behavior, domain knowledge, and conversation context in the translation models.\nIn our previous work, we have experimented the application of IBM Translation Model 1 in vocabulary acquisition through gaze modeling in a conversation setting (Liu et al., 2007). We have reported our initial investigation on incorporating temporal information and domain knowledge in translation models (Qu & Chai, 2008) as well as automatically identifying closely coupled speech and gaze streams (Qu & Chai, 2009). This paper extends our previous work and provides a comprehensive evaluation on incorporating knowledge and interactivity in word acquisition in a much richer application domain. We further examine\nhow word acquisition is affected by automated speech recognition and what is the effect of online word acquisition on language understanding in human-machine conversation."}, {"heading": "3. Domain and Data", "text": "To facilitate our work on word acquisition, we collected data based on situated dialogue in a virtual world. This data set is different from the data set used in our previous investigation (Qu & Chai, 2008). The difference lies in two aspects: 1) this dataset was collected during mixed initiative human-machine conversation whereas the data in our previous investigation was based only on question and answering; 2) user studies in this work were conducted in the context of situated dialogue, where human users are immersed in a complex virtual world and can move around in the virtual environment.\n3.1 Domain\nThe application of our virtual world is for treasure hunting. A human user is immersed in a virtual world (i.e., a castle) 1 and is able to move around to look for hidden treasures. The castle contains 115 3D objects. The user needs to consult with a remote \u201cexpert\u201d (i.e., the artificial agent) for advice on finding the treasures. The expert has some knowledge about the environment and the treasures but cannot see where the user is in the castle. So the user needs to describe to the expert where he is and what he sees in order to get advice on where to go and what to look for.\nFigure 1 shows a snapshot of our virtual world. Figure 2 shows an excerpt of the dialog between a user and the expert in finding one of the treasures. To focus our investigation on word acquisition, we conducted wizard-of-oz studies to collect data 2. More specifically, a set of response templates corresponding to different types of responses are predefined. At each\n1. The virtual world was developed based on the Irrlicht game engine http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/. 2. WOZ studies allow the observation of a user interacting with a fully functional system, where some\nor all of system functions are supplemented by a hidden human wizard. Users are led to believe they are interacting with a real system (Klemmer, Sinha, Chen, Landay, Aboobaker, & Wang, 2000). This technology, which permits the experimentally controlled study of human computer interaction behavior without exposing users to unpredicted responses, has been used widely in earlier research on speech interfaces and multimodal systems.\nsystem turn, the system automatically determines what kind of responses (i.e., template) should be provided; for example, whether to ask for clarification, provide confirmation, or ask more information about a particular object. Such decision is made based on a distribution to simulate different types of system acceptance and rejection. This distribution can be modified according to different needs of the experiments. Based on the chosen template, the human wizard then serves as a language understanding component and fills in this template with the specific information related to the user input. The filled template is\nused to automatically generate natural language which is further processed by the Microsoft Text-to-Speech engine to generate speech responses. During the experiments, the user\u2019s speech was recorded, and the user\u2019s eye gaze was captured by a Tobii eye tracker."}, {"heading": "3.2 Data Preprocessing", "text": "From 20 users\u2019 experiments, we collected 3709 utterances with accompanying gaze fixations. We transcribed the collected speech. The vocabulary size of the speech transcript is 1082, among which 757 are nouns/adjectives. The user\u2019s speech was also automatically recognized online by the Microsoft speech recognizer with a word error rate (WER) of 48.1% for the 1-best recognition. The vocabulary size of the 1-best speech recognition is 3041, among which 1643 are nouns/adjectives. The nouns and adjectives in the transcriptions and the recognized 1-best hypotheses were automatically identified by the Stanford Part-of-Speech Tagger (Toutanova & Manning, 2000; Toutanova, Klein, Manning, & Singer, 2003).\nThe collected speech and gaze streams were automatically paired together by the system. Each time the system detected a sentence boundary of the user\u2019s speech, it paired the recognized speech with the gaze fixations that the system had been accumulating since the previously detected sentence boundary. Figure 3 shows a stream pair of a user\u2019s speech and its accompanying gaze fixations. In the speech stream, each spoken word was timestamped by the speech recognizer. In the gaze stream, each gaze fixation has a starting timestamp ts and an ending timestamp te provided by the eye tracker. Each gaze fixation results in a fixated entity (3D object). When multiple entities are fixated by one gaze fixation due to the overlapping of the entities, the foremost one is chosen. In the gaze stream, the neighboring gaze fixations that fixate the same entity are merged.\nGiven the paired speech and gaze streams, we build a set of parallel word sequences and gaze fixated entity sequences {(w, e)} for the task of word acquisition. The word sequence w consists of only nouns and adjectives from the 1-best recognition of the spoken utterance. The entity sequence e contains the entities fixated by the gaze fixations. For the parallel speech and gaze streams shown in Figure 3, the resulting word sequence is w = [purple vase orange face] and the resulting entity sequence is e = [table vase vase purple vase greek3 ]."}, {"heading": "4.

When aj = 0, wj is not aligned with any entity (e0 represents a null entity). We refer to this model as Model-2.\nCompared to Model-1, Model-2 considers the ordering of words and entities in word acquisition. EM algorithms are used to estimate the probabilities p(w|e) in the translation models."}, {"heading": "5. Incorporating User Language Behavior in Word Acquisition", "text": "In Model-2, word-entity alignments are estimated from co-occurring word and entity sequences in an unsupervised way. The estimated alignments are dependent on where the words/entities appear in the word/entity sequences, not on when those words and gaze fixated entities actually occur. Motivated by the findings that users move their eyes to the mentioned object directly before speaking a word (Griffin & Bock, 2000), we make the word-entity alignments dependent on their temporal relation in a new model (referred as Model-2t):\np(w|e) = m\u220f j=1 l\u2211 i=0 pt(aj = i|j, e,w)p(wj |ei) (3)\nwhere pt(aj = i|j, e,w) is the temporal alignment probability computed based on the temporal distance between entity ei and word wj .\nWe define the temporal distance between ei and wj as\nd(ei, wj) =  0 ts(ei) \u2264 ts(wj) \u2264 te(ei) te(ei)\u2212 ts(wj) ts(wj) > te(ei) ts(ei)\u2212 ts(wj) ts(wj) < ts(ei)\n(4)\nwhere ts(wj) is the starting timestamp (ms) of word wj , ts(ei) and te(ei) are the starting and ending timestamps (ms) of gaze fixation on entity ei.\nThe alignment of word wj and entity ei is decided by their temporal distance d(ei, wj). Based on the psycholinguistic finding that eye gaze happens before a spoken word, wj is not allowed to be aligned with ei when wj happens earlier than ei (i.e., d(ei, wj) > 0). When wj happens no earlier than ei (i.e., d(ei, wj) \u2264 0), the closer they are, the more likely they are aligned. Specifically, the temporal alignment probability of wj and ei in each co-occurring instance (w, e) is computed as\npt(aj = i|j, e,w) =  0 d(ei, wj) > 0 exp[\u03b1 \u00b7 d(ei, wj)] l\u2211\ni=0\nexp[\u03b1 \u00b7 d(ei, wj)] d(ei, wj) \u2264 0 (5)\nwhere \u03b1 is a constant for scaling d(ei, wj). An EM algorithm is used to estimate probabilities p(w|e) and \u03b1 in Model-2t. It is worthwhile to mention that, findings from psycholinguistic studies have provided specific offsets in terms of how eye gaze corresponds to speech production. For example, it shows that speakers look at an object about a second before they say it, but about 100-300 ms after articulation of the object name begins, the eyes move to the next object relevant to the task (Meyer et al., 1998). Since the conversation setting in our study is much more complex than the simple settings in psycholinguistic research, we found larger variations on the offset (Liu et al., 2007) in our data. Therefore we chose not to use any offset in the alignment model here."}, {"heading": "6. Incorporating Domain Knowledge in Word Acquisition", "text": "Speech-gaze temporal alignment and occurrence statistics sometimes are not sufficient to associate words to entities correctly. For example, suppose a user says \u201cthere is a lamp on the dresser\u201d while looking at a lamp object on a table object. Due to their co-occurrence with the lamp object, the words dresser and lamp are both likely to be associated with the lamp object in the translation models. As a result, the word dresser is likely to be incorrectly acquired for the lamp object. For the same reason, the word lamp could be acquired incorrectly for the table object. To solve this type of association problem, the semantic knowledge about the domain and words can be helpful. For example, the knowledge that the word lamp is more semantically related to the object lamp can help the system avoid associating the word dresser to the lamp object. Specifically, we solve this type of wordentity association by utilizing the domain knowledge present in the system and external lexical semantic resources.\nOn one hand, each conversational system has a domain model, which is the knowledge representation about its domain such as the types of objects and their properties and relations, the task structures, etc. This domain model is usually acquired at the development stage before the deployment of the system. The domain model provides an important resource to enable domain reasoning and language interpretation (DeVault & Stone, 2003). On the other hand, there are available resources about domain independent lexical knowledge (e.g., WordNet, see Fellbaum, 1998). The idea is that if the domain model can be linked to the external lexical resources either manually or automatically at the development state, then the external knowledge source can be used to help constrain the acquired words.\nIn the following sections, we first describe our domain modeling, then define the semantic relatedness of word and entity based on domain modeling and WordNet semantic lexicon, and finally describe different ways of using the semantic relatedness of word and entity to help word acquisition."}, {"heading": "6.1 Domain Modeling", "text": "We model the treasure hunting domain as shown in Figure 4. The domain model contains all domain related semantic concepts. For practical conversational systems, this domain modeling is typically acquired at the development stage either through manual authoring by the domain experts or automated learning based on annotated data. In our current work, all properties of the domain entities are represented by domain concepts. The entity properties include: semantic type, color, size, shape, and material. We use WordNet synsets to represent the domain concepts (i.e., synsets in the format of \u201cword#part-of-speech#senseid\u201d). The \u201csense-id\u201d here represents the specific WordNet sense associated with the word in representing the concept. For example, the domain concepts SEM PLATE and COLOR of the entity plate are represented by the synsets \u201cplate#n#4\u201d and \u201ccolor#n#1\u201d in WordNet. Note that the link between domain concepts and WordNet synsets can be automatically acquired given the existing vocabularies. Here, to illustrate the idea, we simplify the problem and directly connect domain concepts to synsets.\nNote that in the domain model, the domain concepts are not specific to a certain entity, they are general concepts for a certain type of entity. Multiple entities of the same type have the same properties and share the same set of domain concepts. Therefore, properties such as color and size of an entity have general concepts \u201ccolor#n#1\u201d and \u201csize#n#1\u201d instead of more specific concepts like \u201cyellow#a#1\u201d and \u201cbig#a#1\u201d, so their concepts can be shared by other entities of the same type, but with different colors and sizes."}, {"heading": "6.2 Semantic Relatedness of Word and Entity", "text": "We compute the semantic relatedness of a word w and an entity e based on the semantic similarity between w and the properties of e using the domain model as a bridge.

It is important to note that prediction precision is more critical than recall for word acquisition when sufficient amount of data is available. Noisy instances where the gaze does not link to the speech content will only hurt word acquisition since they will guide the translation models to ground words to the wrong entities. Although higher recall can be helpful, its effect is expected to become less when co-occurrences can already be established.\nThe results show that speech features (S-Feat) and conversation context features (CCFeat), when used alone, do not improve prediction precision much compared to the baseline of predicting all instances \u201cclosely coupled\u201d with a precision of 67.4%.

This probability provides a means to ground words to entities. In conversational systems, one important goal of word acquisition is to make the system understand the semantic meaning of new words. Word acquisition by grounding words to objects is not always sufficient for identifying their semantic meanings. Suppose the word green is grounded to a green chair object, so is the word chair. Although the system is aware that green is some word describing the green chair, it does not know that the word green refers to the chair\u2019s color while the word chair refers to the chair\u2019s semantic type. Thus, after learning the word-entity associations p(w|e) by the translation models, we need to further ground words to domain concepts of entity properties.\nBased on the domain model discussed earlier (Section 6.1), we apply WordNet to ground words to domain concepts. For each entity e, based on association probabilities p(w|e), we can choose the n-best words as acquired words for e. Those n-best words have the n highest association probabilities.

Discussion and Future Work", "text": "Our experimental results have shown that incorporating extra information improves word acquisition compared to completely unsupervised approaches. However, our current ap-\nproaches have several limitations. First, the incorporation of domain knowledge through semantic relatedness based on WordNet will restrict the acquired words to those appear in WordNet. This is certainly not desirable. But this limitation can be readily addressed by changing the way how the word probability distribution is tailored by semantic relatedness (in Section 6.3.1 and Section 6.3.2). For example, one simple way is to keep the probability mass for those words not in WordNet and only tailor the distribution from those words that occur in WordNet based on their semantic relatedness with the object.\nSecond, in our current approach, acquired words are limited to the words that are recognized by the speech recognizer. As shown in Section 8.3.4, the speech recognition performance is rather poor in our experiments. This is partly due to the lack of language models specifically trained for this domain. Approaches to improve speech recognition, for example, based on a referential semantic language model described in (Schuler, Wu, & Schwartz, 2009) will potentially improve acquisition performance. Furthermore, the set of acquired words is bounded by the vocabulary of the speech recognizer. Any new words that are not in the dictionary will not be acquired. To break this barrier, inspired by previous work (Yu & Ballard, 2004; Taguchi et al., 2009), we are currently extending our approach to incorporate grounding acoustic phoneme sequences to domain concepts.\nAnother limitation of our current approaches is that they are incapable of acquiring multiword expressions. They can only map single words to domain concepts. However, we did observe multiword expressions (e.g., Rubik\u2019s cube) in our data. We will examine this issue in our future work by incorporating more linguistic knowledge and by modeling \u201cfertility\u201d of entities, for example, as in IBM Model 3 and 4.\nThe simplicity of our current models also limits word acquisition performance. For example, the alignment model based on temporal information directly incorporates findings from psycholinguistic studies. These studies were generally conducted in a much simpler settings without interaction. The recent work by Fang, Chai, and Ferreira (2009) has shown correlations between intensity of gaze fixations and objects denoted by linguistic centers\n(e.g., forward-looking centers based on centering theory, Grosz, Joshi, & Weinstein, 1995). We plan to incorporate these results to improve alignment modeling in the future.\nTo further improve performance, another interesting direction is to take into consideration of the interactive nature of conversation, for example, by combining dialog management to solicit user feedback on the acquired words. However, it will be important to identify strategies to balance the trade off between explicit feedback solicitation (and thus lengthening the interaction) and the quality of the acquired words. Reinforcement learning can be a potential approach to address this problem."}, {"heading": "12. Conclusions", "text": "Motivated by the psycholinguistic findings, we investigate the use of eye gaze for automatic word acquisition in multimodal conversational systems. This paper presents several enhanced models that incorporate user language behavior, domain knowledge, and conversation context in word acquisition. Our experiments have shown that these enhanced models significantly improve word acquisition performance.\nRecent advancement in eye tracking technology has made available non-intrusive eye tracking devices that can tolerate head motion and provide high tracking quality. Integrating eye tracking with conversational interfaces is no longer beyond reach. We believe that incorporating eye gaze with automatic word acquisition provides another potential approach to improve the robustness of human-machine conversation."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by IIS-0347548 and IIS-0535112 from the National Science Foundation.

Although these approaches have shown promise, several issues related to human language behavior and human-machine conversation have not been addressed. First, psycholinguistic studies have shown certain temporal regularities between human eye movement and language production. While these regularities can potentially guide the acquisition process, they have not been incorporated in the previous unsupervised approaches. Second, conversational systems generally have an existing knowledge base about the domain and vocabulary. While the existing knowledge can potentially help bootstrap and constrain the acquired new words, it has not been incorporated in the previous models. Third, eye gaze could serve different functions in human-machine conversation. Some gaze streams may not be closely coupled with speech stream, and thus are potentially detrimental to word acquisition. Automated recognition of closely-coupled speech-gaze streams based on conversation context is important. To address these issues, we developed new approaches that incorporate user language behavior, domain knowledge, and conversation context in word acquisition. We evaluated these approaches in the context of situated dialogue in a virtual world. Our experimental results have shown that incorporating the above three types of contextual information significantly improves word acquisition performance.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
