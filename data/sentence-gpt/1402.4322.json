Herein, we study some basic properties of two hierarchical clustering methods: $\\alpha$-unchaining single linkage or $SL(\\alpha)$ and a modified version of this one, $SL^*(\\alpha)$. We compare the results with the properties satisfied by the classical linkage-based hierarchical clustering methods. We find that it has two effects, one effect which can be observed in the leftmost corner of the cluster: \\alpha_{t}$ or $\\alpha\\beta$ for the cluster, \\beta \\beta_{t}$, and that in the rightmost corner of the cluster, \\alpha_{t}$ or $\\alpha\\beta$ is the least efficient, although a slightly different set of results can be observed in the leftmost corner. Our results also show that for this specific method, \\alpha_{t}$ is the least efficient, with its cost proportional to $\\alpha_{t}$ and its cost proportional to $\\alpha_{t}$. A model with a specific type of parameter that is identical to that used in the case of a clustering problem, where it is the least efficient, does not have such an optimal cost proportional to $\\alpha_{t}$.

Introduction\nKleinberg discussed in [7] the problem of clustering in an axiomatic way. He proposed a few basic properties that any clustering scheme should hold. Let P(X) denote the set of all possible partitions of X. Fix a clustering method T so that T(X) = \u03a0 \u2208 P(X). The properties proposed by Kleinberg were:\n\u2022 Scale invariance: For all \u03b1 > 0, T(X,\u03b1 \u00b7 d) = \u03a0 \u2022 Richness: Given a finite set X, for every \u03a0 \u2208 P(X) there exists a metric d\u03a0 on X such that T(X, d\u03a0) = \u03a0. \u2022 Consistency: Let \u03a0 = {B1, ..., Bn}. Let d\u2032 be any metric on X such that 1) for all x, x\u2032 \u2208 Bi, d\u2032(x, x\u2032) \u2264 d(x, x\u2032) and 2) for all x \u2208 Bi, x\u2032 \u2208 Bj , i 6= j, d\u2032(x, x\u2032) \u2265 d(x, x\u2032).\nThen, T(X, d\u2032) = \u03a0.\nThe author was partially supported by MTM-2009-07030. 1\nar X\niv :1\n40 2.\n43 22\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n1 8\nFe b\n20 14\nThen, he proved that no standard clustering scheme satisfying this conditions simultaneously can exist. This does not mean that defining a clustering function is impossible. The impossibility only holds when the unique input in the algorithm is the space and the set of distances. It can be avoided including, for example, the number of clusters to be obtained as part of the input. See [1] and [11].\nCarlsson and M\u00e9moli studied in [4] the analogous problem for hierarchical clustering methods taking as input a finite metric space. They set three basic conditions, see Theorem 3.1, and prove that the unique method satisfying these conditions simultaneously is the well-known single linkage algorithm. The authors prove also that single linkage hierarchical clustering (SL HC) exhibits some good properties. In particular, it is stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense, this is, if two metric spaces are close in the Gromov-Hausdorff metric, then applying the algorithm, the ultrametric spaces obtained are also close in this metric. However, there is a basic weakness in SL HC which is the chaining effect which can be seen as the tendency of the algorithm to merge two blocks when the minimal distance between them is small ignoring everything else in the distribution.\nIn [9] we tried to offer some solution to this effect. We proposed a modified version of SL algorithm, \u03b1-unchaining single linkage (or SL(\u03b1)), which shows some sensitivity to the density distribution of the sample and it is capable to distinguish blocks even though the minimal distance between them is small. We also defined a second version of this method, SL\u2217(\u03b1), to detect blocks when they are connected by a chain of points. Then, we studied the unchaining properties of both methods.\nThus, we were able to offer some solution to these chaining effects but, in exchange, we lost some of the good properties of SL. In particular, SL(\u03b1) is no longer stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. In fact, as we proved in [10], there is no stable solution to this chaining effect in the range of almost-standard linkage-based HC methods using `SL.\nNow, the question is when should we use SL(\u03b1) and SL\u2217(\u03b1). Among the large variety of clustering methods the best option usually depends on the particular clustering problem. But how do we choose the most suitable algorithm for the task? Ackerman, Ben David and Loker propose to study significant properties of the clustering functions. See [1] and [2]. The idea is finding abstract significant properties concerning the output of the algorithms which illustrate the difference between applying one clustering method or another. Then, the practitioner should decide which properties are important for the problem under study and choose the algorithm which satisfies them.\nIn [9] and [10] we proved the chaining, unchaining and stability properties of SL(\u03b1) and SL\u2217(\u03b1). Herein, we complete the work by analyzing which of the abstract characteristic properties of SL are also satisfied by these two methods and which properties are lost by adding the unchaining condition.\nWe start with the characterization of SL HC by Carlsson and M\u00e9moli. In the original characterization of SL from [4], properties I, II and III characterize SL, see 3.1. However, we introduce some alternative definitions to offer a better picture of the difference.\nWe define that a HC method T satisfies property A2 if adding points to the input will never make increase the distance between previous points in the output. This is the case of SL. In fact, we prove that A2 together with A1 (the algorithm leaves ultrametric spaces invariant) and A3 (the distance between two points in the\noutput is at least the minimal \u03b5 > 0 so that there exists a \u03b5-chain between them in the input), offers an alternative characterization of SL. See corollary 3.7.\nProperties A1 and A3 are trivially satisfied by many algorithms, in particular SL(\u03b1), SL\u2217(\u03b1), complete linkage (CL) or average linkage (AL). Thus, A2 illustrates the difference between SL and other methods as those mentioned above. Also, considering the original characterization from [4], it is trivial to check that SL(\u03b1), SL\u2217(\u03b1), AL and CL satisfy I and III but not II and therefore, property II can be used to distinguish those algorithms from SL. However, since II implies A2, we believe that A2 is a better option for the task.\nWe also prove that other basic properties as being permutation invariant or rich are satisfied by all of them.\nThe results obtained in [9], [10] and herein are summarized in Table 1.\n2. Background and notation\nA dendrogram over a finite set is a nested family of partitions. This is usually represented as a rooted tree.\nLet P(X) denote the collection of all partitions of a finite set X = {x1, ..., xn}. Then, a dendrogram can also be described as a map \u03b8 : [0,\u221e)\u2192 P(X) such that:\n1. \u03b8(0) = {{x1}, {x2}, ..., {xn}}, 2. there exists T such that \u03b8(t) = X for every t \u2265 T , 3. if r \u2264 s then \u03b8(r) refines \u03b8(s), 4. for all r there exists \u03b5 > 0 such that \u03b8(r) = \u03b8(t) for t \u2208 [r, r + \u03b5].\nNotice that conditions 2 and 4 imply that there exist t0 < t1 < ... < tm such that \u03b8(r) = \u03b8(ti\u22121) for every r \u2208 [ti\u22121, ti), i = 0, 1, ...,m and \u03b8(r) = \u03b8(tm) = {X} for every r \u2208 [tm,\u221e).\nFor any partition {B1, ..., Bk} \u2208 P(X), the subsets Bi are called blocks. Let D(X) denote the collection of all possible dendrograms over a finite set X. Given some \u03b8 \u2208 D(X), let us denote \u03b8(t) = {Bt1, ..., Btk(t)}. Therefore, the nested family of partitions is given by the corresponding partitions at t0, ..., tm, this is, {Bti1 , ..., B ti k(ti) }, i = 0, ...,m.\nAn ultrametric space is a metric space (X, d) such that d(x, y) \u2264 max{d(x, z), d(z, y)} for all x, y, z \u2208 X. Given a finite metric space X let U(X) denote the set of all ultrametrics over X.\nThere is a well known equivalence between trees and ultrametrics. See [6] and [8] for a complete exposition of how to build categorical equivalences between them. In particular, this may be translated into an equivalence between dendrograms and ultrametrics:\nThus, a hierarchical clustering method T can be presented as an algorithm whose output is a dendrogram or an ultrametric space. Let TD(X, d) denote the dendrogram obtained by applying T to a metric space (X, d) and TU (X, d) denote the corresponding ultrametric space.\nIn [4] the authors use a recursive procedure to redefine SL HC, average linkage (AL) and complete linkage (CL) hierarchical clustering. The main advantage of this procedure is that it allows to merge more than two clusters at the same time. Therefore, AL and CL HC can be made permutation invariant, meaning that the result of the hierarchical clustering does not depend on the order in which the points are introduced in the algorithm. In [9] we gave an alternative presentation of this\nrecursive procedure as a first step to define SL(\u03b1) and SL\u2217(\u03b1). Let us recall here, for completeness, this presentation.\nFor x, y \u2208 X and any (standard) clustering C of X, x \u223cC y if x and y belong to the same cluster in C and x 6\u223cC y, otherwise.\nTwo (standard) clusterings C = (C1, ..., Ck) of (X, d) and C \u2032 = (C \u20321, ...C \u2032k) of (X \u2032, d\u2032) are isomorphic clusterings, denoted (C, d) \u223c= (C \u2032, d\u2032), if there exists a bijection \u03c6 : X \u2192 X \u2032 such that for all x, y \u2208 X, d(x, y) = d\u2032(\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y)) and x \u223cC y if and only if \u03c6(x) \u223cC\u2032 \u03c6(y).\nDefinition 2.1. A linkage function is a function\n` : {(X1, X2, d) | d is a distance function over X1 \u222aX2} \u2192 R+\nsuch that, 1. ` is representation independent: For all (X1, X2) and (X \u20321, X \u20322), if (X1, X2, d) \u223c=\n(X \u20321, X \u2032 2, d \u2032) (i.e., they are clustering-isomorphic), then `(X1, X2, d) = `(X \u20321, X \u20322, d\u2032).\n2. ` is monotonic: For all (X1, X2) if d\u2032 is a distance function over X1 \u222aX2 such that for all x \u223c{X1,X2} y, d(x, y) = d\u2032(x, y) and for all x 6\u223c{X1,X2} y, d(x, y) \u2264 d\u2032(x, y) then `(X1, X2, d\u2032) \u2265 `(X1, X2, d). 3. Any pair of clusters can be made arbitrarily distant: For any pair of data sets (X1, d1), (X2, d2), and any r in the range of `, there exists a distance function d that extends d1 and d2 such that `(X1, X2, d) > r.\nFor technical reasons, it is usually assumed that a linkage function has a countable range. Say, the set of nonnegative algebraic real numbers.\nSome standard choices for ` are: \u2022 Single linkage: `SL(B,B\u2032) = min(x,x\u2032)\u2208B\u00d7B\u2032 d(x, x\u2032) \u2022 Complete linkage: `CL(B,B\u2032) = max(x,x\u2032)\u2208B\u00d7B\u2032 d(x, x\u2032) \u2022 Average linkage: `AL(B,B\u2032) = \u2211 (x,x\u2032)\u2208B\u00d7B\u2032 d(x,x \u2032)\n#(B)\u00b7#(B\u2032) where #(X) denotes the cardinality of the set X.\nLet (X, d) be a finite metric space where X = {x1, ..., xn}. Let L denote a family of linkage functions on X and fix some linkage function ` \u2208 L. Then, let TD(X, d) = \u03b8\n` be as follows: 1. Let \u03980 := {x1, ..., xn} and R0 = 0. 2. For every i \u2265 1, while \u0398i\u22121 6= {X}, let Ri := min{`(B,B\u2032) |B,B\u2032 \u2208\n\u0398i\u22121, B 6= B\u2032}. Then, let G`Ri be a graph whose vertices are the blocks of \u0398i\u22121 and such that there is an edge joining B and B\u2032 if and only if `(B,B\u2032) \u2264 Ri. 3. Consider the equivalence relation B \u223c`,R B\u2032 if and only if B,B\u2032 are in the same connected component of G`R. Then, \u0398i =\n\u0398i\u22121 \u223c`,Ri . 4. Finally, let \u03b8` : [0,\u221e) \u2192 P(X) be such that \u03b8`(r) := \u0398i(r) with i(r) :=\nmax{i |Ri \u2264 r}. In [10] the methods defined by applying this algorithm for some linkage function\n` are called standard linkage-based HC methods. Let us now recall the definition of SL(\u03b1) and SL\u2217(\u03b1). Further explanations,\nfigures and easy examples of applications of these methods can be found in [9]. Given a finite metric space (X, d), let Ft(X, d) be the Rips (or Vietoris-Rips) complex of (X, d). Let us recall that the Rips complex of a metric space (X, d) is a simplicial complex whose vertices are the points of X and [v0, ..., vk] is a simplex\nof Ft(X, d) if and only if d(vi, vj) \u2264 t for every i, j. Given any subset Y \u2282 X, by Ft(Y ) we refer to the subcomplex of Ft(X) defined by the vertices in Y . A simplex [v0, ..., vk] has dimension k. The dimension of a simplicial complex is the maximal dimension of its simplices.\nLet X = {x1, ..., xn}. Let dij := d(xi, xj) and D := {ti : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 m} = {dij : 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n} with ti < tj \u2200 i < j where \u201c<\u201d denotes the order of the real numbers. Clearly, t0 = 0.\nLet the dendrogram defined by SL(\u03b1), TSL(\u03b1)D (X, d) = \u03b8X,\u03b1 or simply \u03b8\u03b1, be as follows:\n1) Let \u03b8\u03b1(0) := {{x1}, ..., {xn}} and \u03b8\u03b1(t) := \u03b8\u03b1(0) \u2200t < t1. Now, for every i, given \u03b8\u03b1[ti\u22121, ti) = \u03b8\u03b1(ti\u22121) = {B1, ..., Bm}, we define recursively \u03b8\u03b1 on the interval [ti, ti+1) as follows: 2) LetGti\u03b1 be a graph with vertices V(Gti\u03b1 ) := {B1, ..., Bm} and edges E(Gti\u03b1 ) := {Bj , Bk} such that the following conditions hold: i) min{d(x, y) |x \u2208 Bj , y \u2208 Bk} \u2264 ti. ii) there is a simplex \u2206 \u2208 Fti(Bj \u222aBk) such that \u2206\u2229Bj 6= \u2205, \u2206\u2229Bk 6= \u2205 and \u03b1 \u00b7 dim(\u2206) \u2265 min{dim(Fti(Bj)), dim(Fti(Bk))}. 3) Let us define a relation, \u223cti,\u03b1 as follows.\nLet Bj \u223cti,\u03b1 Bk if Bj , Bk belong to the same connected component of the graph Gti\u03b1 . Then, \u223cti,\u03b1 induces an equivalence relation. 4) For every t \u2208 [ti, ti+1), \u03b8\u03b1(t) := \u03b8\u03b1(ti\u22121)/ \u223cti,\u03b1. This construction is generalized in [10] to define the class of almost-standard\nlinkage-based HC methods.\nRemark 2.2. Notice that if two points x, x\u2032 belong to the same block of \u03b8\u03b1(ti) then, necessarily, there exists a ti-chain, x = x0, x1, ..., xn = x\u2032 joining them. In particular, if xj \u2208 Bj \u2208 \u03b8\u03b1(ti\u22121), j = 0, ..., n, the corresponding edges {Bj\u22121, Bj}, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, satisfy condition ii. This is immediate by construction.\nLet the dendrogram defined by SL\u2217(\u03b1), TSL \u2217(\u03b1)\nD (X, d) = \u03b8 \u2217 X,\u03b1 or simply \u03b8 \u2217 \u03b1, be\nas follows: 1) Let \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(0) := {{x1}, ..., {xn}} and \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(t) := \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(0) \u2200t < t1.\nNow, given \u03b8\u2217\u03b1[ti\u22121, ti) = \u03b8\u2217(ti\u22121) = {B1, ..., Bm}, we define recursively \u03b8\u2217\u03b1 on the interval [ti, ti+1) as follows: 2) LetGti\u03b1 be a graph with vertices V(Gti\u03b1 ) := {B1, ..., Bm} and edges E(Gti\u03b1 ) := {Bj , Bk} such that the following conditions hold: i) min{d(x, y) |x \u2208 Bj , y \u2208 Bk} \u2264 ti. ii) there is a simplex \u2206 \u2208 Fti(Bj \u222aBk) such that \u2206\u2229Bj 6= \u2205, \u2206\u2229Bk 6= \u2205\nand \u03b1 \u00b7 dim(\u2206) \u2265 min{dim(Fti(Bj)), dim(Fti(Bk))}. By an abuse of the notation, we may write B to refer both to the block\nof \u03b8(ti\u22121) and to the vertex of Gti\u03b1 . 3) Let us define a relation, \u223cti,\u03b1 between the blocks as follows.\nLet cc(Gti\u03b1 ) be the set of connected components of the graph Gti\u03b1 . Let A \u2208 cc(Gti\u03b1 ) with A = {Bj1 , ..., Bjr}.\nLet us call big blocks of A those blocks such that\n(1) \u03b1 \u00b7#(Bjk) \u2265 max 1\u2264l\u2264r {#(Bjl)}.\nThe rest of blocks of A are called small blocks.\nLet H\u03b1(A) be the subgraph of A whose vertices are the big blocks and S\u03b1(A) be the subgraph of A whose vertices are the small blocks.\nThen, Bjk \u223cti,\u03b1 Bjk\u2032 if one of the following conditions holds: iii) \u2203C \u2208 cc(H\u03b1(A)) such that Bjk , Bjk\u2032 \u2208 C. iv) Bjk \u2208 C \u2208 cc(H\u03b1(A)), Bjk\u2032 \u2208 C\n\u2032 \u2208 cc(S\u03b1(A)) and there is no big block in A\\C adjacent to any block in C \u2032. Then, \u223cti,\u03b1 induces an equivalence relation whose classes are contained in the connected components of Gti\u03b1 .\n4) For every t \u2208 [ti, ti+1), \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(t) := \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(ti\u22121)/ \u223cti,\u03b1.\nRemark 2.3. At step iii, if H\u03b1(A) is connected, then Bj1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a Bjr defines a block of \u03b8\u03b1(ti).\nRemark 2.4. Notice that Remark 2.2 still applies. In fact, if two points x, x\u2032 belong to the same block of \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(ti) then, necessarily, there exists a ti-chain, x = x0, x1, ..., xn = x\n\u2032 joining them so that if xj \u2208 Bj \u2208 \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(ti\u22121), j = 0, ..., n, the corresponding edges {Bj\u22121, Bj}, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, satisfy condition ii.\n3. Single linkage hierarchical clustering\nIn this section we recall some basic properties and the characterization of SL HC from [4]. We also propose some alternatives. Our first intention is to find significant properties to compare SL and SL(\u03b1).\n3.1. Characterization of SL. Carlsson and M\u00e9moli provided the following axiomatic characterization of SL HC:\nLet us recall that given a finite metric space (X, d), sep(X, d) := minx 6=x\u2032d(x, x\u2032).\nTheorem 3.1. [4, Theorem 18] Let T be a hierarchical clustering method such that: (I) TU ( {p, q}, ( \u03b4 0 0 \u03b4 )) = ( {p, q}, ( \u03b4 0 0 \u03b4 )) for all \u03b4 > 0.\n(II) Given two finite metric spaces X,Y and \u03c6 : X \u2192 Y such that dX(x, x\u2032) \u2265 dY (\u03c6(x), \u03c6(x \u2032)) for all x, x\u2032 \u2208 X, then\nuX(x, x \u2032) \u2265 uY (\u03c6(x), \u03c6(x\u2032))\nalso holds for all x, x\u2032 \u2208 X, where TU (X, dX) = (X,uX) and TU (Y, dY ) = (Y, uY ).\n(III) For any metric space (X, d),\nu(x, x\u2032) \u2265 sep(X, d) for all x 6= x\u2032 \u2208 X\nwhere TU (X, d) = (X,u). Then, T is exactly single linkage hierarchical clustering.\nNotation: For the particular case of SL HC, if there is no need to distinguish the metric space, let us denote TSLD (X, d) = \u03b8SL and T SL U (X, d) = (X,uSL).\nNotation: Given two metrics d, d\u2032 defined on a set X, let us denote d \u2264 d\u2032 if d(x, x\u2032) \u2264 d\u2032(x, x\u2032) \u2200x, x\u2032 \u2208 X.\nThe following propositions follow immediately from the proof of [4, Theorem 18].\nProposition 3.2. For any metric space (X, d), if T satisfies conditions II and III, then u \u2265 uSL.\nThis is, the ultrametric distance between two points is at least the minimal length \u03b5 for which there is a \u03b5-chain joining them.\nIt is readily seen that if u \u2265 uSL, then T satifies III.\nProposition 3.3. If T satisfies conditions I and II, then uSL \u2265 u.\nIn fact, Proposition 3.3 can be improved introducing the following condition. A2) Let (Y, d) be a metric space and X \u2282 Y . If i : X \u2192 Y is the inclusion map, then uX(x, x\u2032) \u2265 uY (i(x), i(x\u2032)). This is, by adding points to the space we may make the ultrametric distance smaller but never bigger. Clearly, II \u21d2 A2. The proof of Proposition 3.3, [4], can be trivially adapted to obtain the following.\nProposition 3.4. If T satisfies conditions I and A2, then uSL \u2265 u.\nProof. Let x, x\u2032 \u2208 (X, d) such that uSL(x, x\u2032) = \u03b4. Then, there exists a \u03b4-chain x = x0, x1, ..., xn = x\n\u2032 such that maxi d(xi\u22121, xi) = \u03b4. By I, if Xi = {xi\u22121, xi}, T(Xi, d|Xi) = (Xi, d|Xi) and uXi(xi\u22121, xi) \u2264 \u03b4. Then, by A2, u(xi\u22121, xi) \u2264 uXi(xi\u22121, xi) \u2264 \u03b4 and, by the properties of the ultrametric, u(x, x\u2032) \u2264 \u03b4.\nAnother natural condition to ask on a hierarchical clustering method is leaving invariant any ultrametric space:\nA1) If (X, d) is an ultrametric space, then u(x, y) = d(x, y). This is, applying the hierarchical clustering method to an ultrametric space we\nobtain the same ultrametric space. Also, it can be readily seen that SL HC satisfies A1:\nProposition 3.5. If (X, d) is an ultrametric space, then uSL(x, y) = d(x, y) for every x, y \u2208 X.\nProof. By definition, it is clear that uSL(x, y) \u2264 d(x, y) for every x, y \u2208 X. Let us see that, if (X, d) is an ultrametric space, then uSL(x, y) \u2265 d(x, y). uSL(x, y) = inf{t | there exists a t-chain joining x to y}. Suppose uSL(x, y) = t and let x = x0, x1, ..., xn = y be a t-chain joining x to y. By the properties of the ultrametric, d(xi\u22121, xi+1) \u2264 max{d(xi\u22121, xi), d(xi, xi+1)} \u2264 t for every 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u22121. Therefore, d(x, y) \u2264 t and uSL(x, y) \u2265 d(x, y).\nRichness property for HC methods can be defined in the same way Kleinberg did for standard clustering. Thus, a HC method T satisfies richness property if given a finite set X, for every \u03b8 \u2208 D(X) there exists a metric d\u03b8 on X such that TD(X, d\u03b8) = \u03b8.\nCorollary 3.6. TSL satisfies richness property.\nIt is trivial to check that A1 \u21d2 I (and A3 \u21d2 III). Therefore, by Proposition 3.4, we obtain also the following alternative characterization of SL HC.\nCorollary 3.7. Let T be a hierarchical clustering method such that: A1) If (X, d) is an ultrametric space, then uX(x, y) = d(x, y). A2) Let (Y, d) be a metric space and X \u2282 Y . If i : X \u2192 Y is the inclusion map,\nthen uX(x, x\u2032) \u2265 uY (i(x), i(x\u2032)). A3) u \u2265 uSL. Then, T is exactly SL HC.\n3.2. Stability of SL. Let us recall the definition of Gromov-Hausdorff distance from [3]. See also [5].\nLet (X, dX) and (Y, dY ) two metric spaces. A correspondence (between A and B) is a subset R \u2208 A\u00d7B such that\n\u2022 \u2200 a \u2208 A, there exists b \u2208 B s.t. (a, b) \u2208 R \u2022 \u2200 b \u2208 B, there exists a \u2208 A s.t. (a, b) \u2208 R\nLet R(A,B) denote the set of all possible correspondences between A and B. Let \u0393X,Y : X \u00d7 Y \u00d7X \u00d7 Y \u2192 R+ given by\n(x, y, x\u2032, y\u2032) 7\u2192 |dX(x, x\u2032)\u2212 dY (y, y\u2032)|.\nThen, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between X and Y is:\ndGH(X,Y ) := 1\n2 inf R\u2208R(X,Y ) sup (x,y)(x\u2032,y\u2032)\u2208R \u0393X,Y (x, y, x\n\u2032, y\u2032).\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff metric gives a notion of distance between metric spaces. One of the advantages of this metric is that it is well defined for metric spaces of different cardinality. In [4] this metric is used to prove that TSL holds some stability under small perturbations on the metric. The authors prove that if two metric spaces are close (in the Gromov-Hausdorff metric) then the corresponding ultrametric spaces obtained as output of the algorithm are also close. In [10] we studied Gromov-Hausdorff stability of linkage-based HC methods defining the following conditions.\nNotation: Let (M, dGH) denote the set of finite metric spaces with the GromovHausdorff metric and (U , dGH) denote the set of finite ultrametric spaces with the Gromov-Hausdorff metric.\nDefinition 3.8. A HC method T is semi-stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense if for any sequence of finite metric spaces ((Xk, dk))k\u2208N in (M, dGH) such that limk\u2192\u221e(Xk, dk) = (U, d) \u2208 U then limk\u2192\u221e TU (Xk, dk) = TU (U, d).\nDefinition 3.9. A HC method T is stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense if\nTU : (M, dGH)\u2192 (U , dGH)\nis continuous.\nA hierarchical clustering method is said to be permutation invariant if it yields the same dendrogram under permutation of the points in the sample this is, if the output of the algorithm does not depend on the order by which the data is introduced. Although this is not the easiest way to check this property, it may be noticed that being stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense implies being permutation invariant.\nThe following result is a consequence of [4, Proposition 26].\nProposition 3.10. SL HC is stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. In particular, it is semi-stable and permutation invariant.\n4. Basic properties of SL(\u03b1) and SL\u2217(\u03b1)\nIn this section, we study some basic properties on SL(\u03b1) and SL\u2217(\u03b1). In particular, we check those seen at Section 3 .\nThe following result is clear from the definition.\nProposition 4.1. SL(\u03b1) and SL\u2217(\u03b1) are permutation invariant algorithms.\nProposition 4.2. Let (X, d) be a finite metric space with X = {x1, ..., xn}. If \u03b1 \u2265 n\u221222 , then T SL(X) = TSL(\u03b1)(X).\nProof. Let TSLD (X) = \u03b8SL, T SL(\u03b1) D (X) = \u03b8\u03b1.\nWe know that \u03b8SL(t0) = \u03b8\u03b1(t0). Suppose \u03b8SL(ti\u22121) = \u03b8\u03b1(ti\u22121). Let us see that for \u03b1 \u2265 n\u221222 , condition i already implies ii and the edges of the graph Gti\u03b1 are those defined by condition i. Let B1, B2 two blocks in \u03b8\u03b1(ti\u22121) such that min{d(x, y) |x \u2208 B1, y \u2208 B2} \u2264 ti. For any simplex \u2206, \u03b1 \u00b7 dim(\u2206) \u2265 \u03b1 and min{#(B1),#(B2)} \u2264 n2 . Since \u03b1 \u2265 n\u22122 2 , \u03b1 \u00b7 dim(\u2206) \u2265 \u03b1 \u2265 min{#(B1) \u2212 1,#(B2)\u2212 1} \u2265 min{dim(Fti(B1)), dim(Fti(B2))}. Then, \u03b8SL(ti) = \u03b8\u03b1(ti).\nProposition 4.3. Let (X, d) be a finite metric space with X = {x1, ..., xn}. If \u03b1 \u2265 n\u2212 1, then TSL(X) = TSL\u2217(\u03b1)(X).\nProof. Let TSLD (X) = \u03b8SL and T SL\u2217(\u03b1) D (X) = \u03b8 \u2217 \u03b1.\nWe know that \u03b8SL(t0) = \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(t0). Suppose \u03b8SL(ti\u22121) = \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(ti\u22121). As we saw in the proof of Proposition 4.2, since \u03b1 \u2265 n \u2212 1 > n\u221222 , condition i already implies ii and the edges of the graph Gti\u03b1 are those defined by condition i. Now, let A = {B1, ..., Br} be any connected component of Gti\u03b1 . If the subgraph H\u03b1(A) is not connected, then there are at least three blocks Bi1 , Bi2 , Bi3 in A, such that 1 \u2264 #(Bi1) < 1\u03b1 max1\u2264l\u2264r{#(Bl)} and #(Bi2),#(Bi3) \u2265 1 \u03b1 max1\u2264l\u2264r{#(Bl)}. Trivially, max1\u2264l\u2264r{#(Bl)} \u2264 n \u2212 2. Hence, there is a contradiction since 1 \u2264 n\u22122\u03b1 \u2264 n\u22122 n\u22121 < 1.\nThus, H\u03b1(A) is connected and, as we saw in Remark 2.3, all the blocks in A are identified. Therefore, \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(ti) = \u03b8SL(ti).\nNotation: Let X be a finite metric space. Let us recall that if there is no ambiguity on the metric space we denote TSLD (X) = \u03b8SL, \u03b7(\u03b8SL) = uSL and T SL(\u03b1) D (X) = \u03b8\u03b1. Let us denote \u03b7(\u03b8\u03b1) = u\u03b1. Similarly, let T SL\u2217(\u03b1) D (X) = \u03b8 \u2217 \u03b1 and \u03b7(\u03b8\u2217\u03b1) = u\u2217\u03b1.\nProposition 4.4. uSL \u2264 u\u03b1 and uSL \u2264 u\u2217\u03b1 for every \u03b1 \u2208 N (i.e. TSL(\u03b1) and TSL \u2217(\u03b1) satisfy A3).\nProof. As we saw at remarks 2.2 and 2.4, if two points x, x\u2032 \u2208 X belong to the same block of \u03b8\u03b1(t) (resp. \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(t)), they belong, in particular, to the same t-component of X and, therefore, to the same block of \u03b8SL(t). Thus, uSL(x, x\u2032) \u2264 u\u03b1(x, x\u2032) (resp. uSL(x, x \u2032) \u2264 u\u2217\u03b1(x, x\u2032)).\nProposition 4.5. If (X, d) is an ultrametric space, then \u03b8\u03b1 = \u03b8SL = \u03b8\u2217\u03b1 for every \u03b1.\nProof. By definition, \u03b8\u03b1(t0) = \u03b8SL(t0) = \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(t0). Suppose \u03b8\u03b1(ti\u22121) = \u03b8SL(ti\u22121) = \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(ti\u22121) = {B1, ..., Bn}. Let us see that \u03b8\u03b1(ti) = \u03b8SL(ti) = \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(ti).\nLet Bi, Bj be such that min{d(x, y) |x \u2208 Bi, y \u2208 Bj} \u2264 ti. Since Bi, Bj are (ti\u22121)-components, by the properties of the ultrametric, d(x, y) \u2264 ti for every (x, y) \u2208 B1 \u00d7B2.\nTherefore, every pair of points in B1 \u222aB2 define a simplex in Fti(B1 \u222aB2) and condition ii holds for every \u03b1. Thus, there is an edge defined between Bi and Bj . This proves that \u03b8\u03b1 = \u03b8SL.\nNow, let Bi, Bj be two blocks in the same connected component of Gti\u03b1 . Then, by the properties of the ultrametric, {Bi, Bj} is an edge of Gti\u03b1 . Hence, H\u03b1(Gti\u03b1 ) is connected and, as we saw in Remark 2.3, \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(ti) is defined by the connected components of Gti\u03b1 . This proves that \u03b8\u2217\u03b1 = \u03b8SL.\nCorollary 4.6. If (X, d) is an ultrametric space, then u\u03b1(x, y) = u\u2217\u03b1(x, y) = d(x, y) for every x, y \u2208 X.\nCorollary 4.7. SL(\u03b1) and SL\u2217(\u03b1) satisfy A1 and A3 but not A2.\nNotice that if A2 were also satisfied then, by Corollary 3.7, the method would be exactly SL. For an example of how these methods fail to satisfy A2 consider the following example from [9].\nExample 4.8. Let (X, d) be the graph from Figure 1. Suppose the edges in N1, N2 have length 1 and the rest have length 3. The distances between vertices are measured as the minimal length of a path joining them.\nLet Z := {x0, y0} and d\u2032(x0, y0) = 3. Let i : (Z, d\u2032) \u2192 (X, d) be the inclusion map. It is immediate to check that applying either SL(\u03b1) or SL\u2217(\u03b1) with \u03b1 < 3 we obtain ultrametric spaces (Z, uZ), (X,uX) such that uZ(x0, y0) < uX(x0, y0).\nCorollary 4.9. SL(\u03b1) and SL\u2217(\u03b1) satisfy richness property.\nAs we saw in [10], SL(\u03b1) is semi-stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. Unfortunately, most of the good stability properties of SL do not hold. SL(\u03b1) and SL\u2217(\u03b1) are not stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense (see [10]) and it is not difficult to check that SL\u2217(\u03b1) is not semi-stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. Small perturbations on the distances may affect the dimension of the Rips complex and\nto whether or not condition ii applies. Also, they may affect the size of the components and yield very different graphs Gti\u03b1 . Furthermore, changing the parameter \u03b1 we may obtain a very different dendrogram. However, all the instability is produced by the unchaining conditions ii, iii and iv. Thus, \u03b8\u03b1 and \u03b8\u2217\u03b1 may be compared with \u03b8 to, at least, keep track of the undesired effects on the stability introduced with the unchaining conditions.\nExample 4.10. Let (X, d) be the graph from Figure 2 where every edge has length 1 and let (X, d\u2032) be the same graph where d(x0, y0) = 1 + \u03b5 for some \u03b5 > 0 and the rest of the edges have length 1. Let \u03b81 = T SL(1) D (X, d) and \u03b8 \u2032 1 = T SL(1) D (X, d\n\u2032). As we saw above, \u03b81(t) = {{x0}, ..., {x3}, {y0}, ...{y3}} if t < 1 and \u03b81(1) = {X}. Thus, if \u03b7(\u03b81) = u if follows that u(x, y) = 1 \u2200x, y \u2208 X. If we apply SL(1) to (X, d\u2032) we obtain that \u03b8\u20321(t) = {{x0}, ..., {x3}, {y0}, ...{y3}} if t < 1 and \u03b8\u20321(t) = {B1, B2} for 1 \u2264 t < 1 + \u03b5. For 1 + \u03b5 \u2264 t \u2264 2, by condition ii, there is no edge in Gt1 between B1 and B2. Thus, \u03b8\u20321(t) = {B1, B2} for 1 + \u03b5 \u2264 t < 2 + \u03b5. For t \u2265 2 + \u03b5, \u03b8\u20321(t) = X. Thus, if \u03b7(\u03b8\u20321) = u\u2032 if follows that u\u2032(xi, xj) = 1 \u2200xi, xj \u2208 B1, u\u2032(yi, yj) = 1 \u2200 yi, yj \u2208 B2 and u\u2032(xi, yj) = 2 + \u03b5 \u2200 (xi, yj) \u2208 B1\u00d7B2.\nIn this case, dGH((X, d), (X, d\u2032)) = \u03b52 and dGH((X,u), (X,u \u2032)) = 1+\u03b52 . Therefore,\nSL(\u03b1) is not stable in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense.\nAlso, it is unstable under the change of the parameter \u03b1.\nExample 4.11. Let (X, d\u2032) be the graph with the metric defined in Example 4.10. As we just saw, if \u03b7(\u03b8\u20321) = u\u2032 if follows that u\u2032(xi, xj) = 1 \u2200xi, xj \u2208 B1, u\u2032(yi, yj) = 1 \u2200 yi, yj \u2208 B2 and u\u2032(xi, yj) = 2 + \u03b5 \u2200 (xi, yj) \u2208 B1 \u00d7B2. If we apply SL(3) to (X, d\u2032) we obtain that \u03b8\u20323(t) = {{x0}, ..., {x3}, {y0}, ...{y3}} if t < 1 and \u03b8\u20323(t) = {B1, B2} for 1 \u2264 t < 1+\u03b5. For 1+\u03b5 \u2264 t \u2264 2, since \u03b1 = 3 there is an edge in Gt3 between B1 and B2. Thus, \u03b8\u20323(t) = {X} for 1 + \u03b5 \u2264 t. Hence, if \u03b7(\u03b8\u20323) = u\n\u2032\u2032 if follows that u\u2032\u2032(xi, xj) = 1 \u2200xi, xj \u2208 B1, u\u2032\u2032(yi, yj) = 1 \u2200 yi, yj \u2208 B2 and u\u2032\u2032(xi, yj) = 1 + \u03b5 \u2200 (xi, yj) \u2208 B1 \u00d7B2.\nTherefore, dGH((X,u\u2032), (X,u\u2032\u2032)) = 12 .\nOne may wonder if given \u03b1 > \u03b1\u2032 anything can be told about the corresponding dendrograms. In particular, given TSL\n\u2217(\u03b1) U (X, d) = u \u2217 \u03b1 and T SL\u2217(\u03b1\u2032) U (X, d) = u \u2217 \u03b1\u2032 , it\nis natural to ask if u\u2217\u03b1 \u2264 u\u2217\u03b1\u2032 or u\u2217\u03b1\u2032 \u2264 u\u2217\u03b1. This need not be true. In fact, it may fail by conditions iii and iv, see Example 4.12, or by condition ii, see Example 4.13.\nB1 B2 B3\nti ti\nExample 4.12. Let \u03b1 > \u03b1\u2032. Suppose that \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(ti\u22121) = \u03b8\u2217\u03b1\u2032(ti\u22121) = {B1, B2, B3}. See the example above from Figure 3. Now, suppose that conditions i, ii define edges {B1, B2} and {B2, B3} but not {B1, B3} in both Gti\u03b1 and G ti \u03b1\u2032 .\nSuppose that max1\u2264l\u22643{#(Bl)} = #(B1). Also, let us suppose that \u03b1 \u00b7#(B2) < #(B1), \u03b1\u2032 \u00b7#(B2) < #(B1), \u03b1 \u00b7#(B3) \u2265 #(B1) but \u03b1\u2032 \u00b7#(B3) < #(B1). In this case, there is a unique connected component A = {B1, B2, B3} and H\u03b1\u2032(A) = {B1} is connected while H\u03b1(A) = {B1, B3} is not connected. Thus, \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(ti) = {B1, B2, B3} and \u03b8\u2217\u03b1\u2032(ti) = {B1 \u222aB2 \u222aB3} = {X}.\nSuppose that \u03b8\u2217\u03b1\u2032(ti\u22121) = \u03b8 \u2217 \u03b1\u2032(ti\u22121) = {B\u20321, B\u20322, B\u20323}. See the example below from Figure 3. Now, suppose that conditions i, ii define edges {B\u20321, B\u20322} and {B\u20322, B\u20323} but not {B\u20321, B\u20323} in both Gti\u03b1 and G ti \u03b1\u2032 .\nSuppose that max1\u2264l\u22643{#(B\u2032l)} = #(B\u20321). Let us suppose that \u03b1 \u00b7 #(B\u20323) > #(B\u20321), \u03b1\u2032 \u00b7#(B\u20323) > #(B\u20321), \u03b1 \u00b7#(B\u20322) \u2265 #(B\u20321) but \u03b1\u2032 \u00b7#(B\u20322) < #(B\u20321). In this case, there is a unique connected component A = {B1, B2, B3}, H\u03b1(A) has vertices B\u20321, B \u2032 2, B \u2032 3 and it is connected while H\u03b1\u2032(A) = {B\u20321, B\u20323} is not connected. Thus, \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(ti) = {B\u20321 \u222aB\u20322 \u222aB\u20323} = {X} and \u03b8\u2217\u03b1\u2032(ti) = {B\u20321, B\u20322, B\u20323}. Hence, even in the case when there is no chaining effect between adjacent blocks, \u03b8\u2217\u03b1(ti) need not refine \u03b8\u2217\u03b1\u2032(ti) and \u03b8 \u2217 \u03b1\u2032(ti) need not refine \u03b8 \u2217 \u03b1(ti).\nIn particular, u\u2217\u03b1 6\u2264 u\u2217\u03b1\u2032 and u\u2217\u03b1\u2032 6\u2264 u\u2217\u03b1.\nExample 4.13. Let \u03b1 > \u03b1\u2032. Suppose \u03b8\u03b1(ti\u22121) = \u03b8\u03b1\u2032(ti\u22121) = {B1, B2, B3, B4}, d(B1, B2) = d(B3, B4) = ti, d(B1, B3) = ti+1 and the rest of respective distances between these blocks are bigger than ti+1. See Figure 4.\nSince \u03b1 > \u03b1\u2032, we may assume, by condition ii, that there is an edge between B1, B2 and between B3, B4 in Gti\u03b1 but not in G ti \u03b1\u2032 . Thus, suppose \u03b8\u03b1(ti) = {B6, B7} while \u03b8\u03b1\u2032(ti) = {B1, B2, B3, B4}. Now, we may assume that dim(Fti+1(B1)), dim(Fti+1(B2)) < dim(Fti+1(B6)) and dim(Fti+1(B3)), dim(Fti+1(B4)) < dim(Fti+1(B7)). Thus, we may also assume that, at ti+1, for \u03b1\u2032 there is no edge between B6, B7 but for \u03b1 there is an edge between B1, B3. Therefore, \u03b8\u03b1\u2032(ti+1) = {B6, B7} while \u03b8\u03b1(ti+1) = {B5, B2, B4}.\nHence, \u03b8\u03b1(ti) does not refine \u03b8\u03b1\u2032(ti) and \u03b8\u03b1\u2032(ti) does not refine \u03b8\u03b1(ti). In particular, it is immediate to check that u\u03b1 6\u2264 u\u03b1\u2032 and u\u03b1\u2032 6\u2264 u\u03b1.\n5. Conclusions\nIn the spirit of Kleinberg impossibility result we may consider A1 (the algorithm leaves ultrametric spaces invariant) and A3 (the distance between two points in the output is at least the minimal \u03b5 > 0 so that there exists a \u03b5-chain between them in the input) as basic desirable conditions for any HC algorithm T. Thus, if we assume that T satisfies A1 and A3, then either T is exactly SL or else, condition A2 (adding points to the input will never make increase the distance between previous points in the output) is not satisfied. In particular, condition A2 is not satisfied by the algorithms defined to treat the chaining effects: SL(\u03b1) and SL\u2217(\u03b1).\nApart from this inevitable difference, we prove that the properties A1, A3, permutation invariance and richness are satisfied by SL(\u03b1) and SL\u2217(\u03b1) and also by the classical linkage-based algorithms, SL, CL and AL.\nTheir chaining and unchaining properties were studied in [9]. The stability properties of linkage-based methods were analyzed in [10]. The main results are summarized in Table 1.\nReferences\n[1] Ackerman M, Ben-David S, Loker D.
