INTRODUCTION", "text": "To facilitate discrimination between objects the experts use feature selection algorithms in order to select a subset of features which are the most discriminant, without deteriorating the reliability of the data. The problem of feature selection has often been treated in classical data analysis (e.g., discriminant analysis); many techniques or algorithms have been proposed [1].\nIn classical data analysis, the data are represented by an array of individual \u00d7 variables, and the goal of discrimination is to distinguish between the classes of individuals. With the growth of databases, it becomes very important to summarize these data by using a complex type called symbolic object [2] [3].\nThe feature selection algorithms on symbolic objects need complex calculation, since the data processed may represent classes of real individuals and each variable is not limited to one value, but may indicate a distribution of values [4]. Therefore our study will focus on two main elements: choosing of a good dissimilarity measure to select powerful variables, and improving the algorithm complexity.\nThe purpose of the feature selection algorithm which we present here is to find the minimum set of variables which contribute in the discrimination between different symbolic objects, and eliminate the variables which not contribute in discrimination or which contribution is already covered by the selected variables.\nSince symbolic objects are complex data, very few feature selection algorithms have been developed until now in Symbolic Data Analysis. The selection criteria used in these algorithms must deal with many types of data (alphabetic, numeric, intervals, set of values), and should measure a dissimilarity between symbolic objects. Also these algorithms should be well optimized to support complex calculations. In our paper we will present a new feature selection\nalgorithm with a strong selection criterion, which can deal with any type of data; and we will see how this algorithm will be optimize in order to process feature selection on large symbolic objects datasets."}, {"heading": "2. SYMBOLIC OBJECTS", "text": "Before we present the algorithm, we will give some definitions of symbolic objects [5]: Y= {y1,\u2026, yn} is the set of variables; O= {O1,\u2026,On} is the set of domains where each variable takes its values; \u2126={w1, \u2026, wp} is the set of elementary observed objects; \u2126\u2019 = O1\u00d7\u2026. \u00d7On is the set of all possible elementary observed objects.

Suppose Alain has brown hair and John has grey hair. If \u201chair\u201d is considered as a variable, this means that hair(Alain) = brown and hair(John) = grey.\nThe elementary event e1 = [hair = {brown, black}] is such that: e1(Alain) = true, since hair(Alain)=brown \u2208 {brown, black}.\nIf Alain is tall and John is short we can build the following assertion: a = [hair ={brown, black} ] \u2227 [height ={tall, small}]\nWe distinguish two types of extents:\n The real extent of the symbolic object a is defined referring to \u2126, and present the set of\nelementary objects observed which satisfy: ext\u2126(a)={wl \u2208 \u2126|a(wl) = true}.\n The virtual extent of symbolic object a is defined referring to \u2126\u2019, and present the set of\nelementary objects observed which satisfy: ext\u2126\u2019(a) = {wl\u2019\u2208 \u2126\u2019| a(wl\u2019) = true, i.e., \u2200 yi yi(wl\u2019)\u2208 vi and vi \u2208 Vi }, where vi is a value taken by the variable yi in the object wl\u2019 and Vi is a value taken by the variable yi in the assertion a.\nExample 2:\nLet \u2126={Alain, John, Sam} hair(Alain) = brown and height(Alain) = tall hair(John) = grey and height(John) = tall hair(Sam) = black and height(Sam) = small. a = [hair ={brown, black}] \u2227 [height ={tall, small}] ext\u2126(a) = {Alain, Sam}.

MINSET ALGORITHM", "text": "In the literature, we can find only very few algorithms which can treat feature selection for symbolic objects. We can cite, the algorithm of Ichino [11] uses geometrical thickness criterion to select the features, the algorithm of Nagabhushan et al. [12] and Kiranagi et al. [13] select features for clustering objects using similarity between symbolic objects, and the algorithm of Chouakria et al. [14] is for principal components. In our paper, we will concentrate on the algorithm of Vignes [6] called Minset, since it is the only algorithm doing feature selection on symbolic object with the purpose to discriminate between objects. And we will propose in this paper a new algorithm called Minset-Plus base on the improvement made on Minset algorithm.\nTo discriminate the objects, the Minset algorithm proceeds by finding discrimination between all assertion pairs. The underlying idea of this treatment results from the fact the discrimination between symbolic objects is based on the intersection of their virtual extensions. The idea of the Minset algorithm is formalized as follows. We have as entry the knowledge base (Y,O, A). The objective of the algorithm is to find another knowledge base (Y\u2019,O\u2019,A) such that w h The subsets Y and Y\u2019 represent two sets of variables. The algorithm has three principal steps:\nThe first step is to select the indispensable variables. A variable is considered as indispensable, if when you remove it from the set of variables, the discrimination power of this set of variables will be reduce (less than the discrimination power of all variables)\nThe second step in the algorithm is to select in each iteration a variable which has the greater value in discriminating the symbolic objects, not discriminate yet by the selected variables.\nThe third step will illuminate a variable which become redundant, it means that the part of discrimination bring by this variable, have been covered by a combination of the other selected variables.\n1. Find the indispensible variables which permit to discriminate assertion pairs not discriminated by other variables. This means we select all other variables such that their\nODP against all other variables is \u22600: ODP(yi,Y-yi, K)\u22600.\nSet Y\u2019 = Y Set While DP( , K) < DP(Y, K) 2. Select in each step the variable which has the highest ODP. The selected variable\npermits to discriminate the greatest number of assertion pairs, not already discriminated by the variables selected before.\nY\u2019= Y\u2019 - Selected variables\n\u2200 \u2208\n3. Eliminate in each step the variables which become redundant. This means the assertion\npairs discriminated by these variables are discriminated by other selected variables.\n\u2208"}, {"heading": "5 MINSET-PLUS ALGORITHM", "text": ""}, {"heading": "5.1.

The discovery of some mathematical properties relating to the function ODP and DP has permitted us to reduce considerably the temporal complexity of the algorithm (see section 6).\nThe object class\u2019s outlines are often fuzzy because they depend on the subjectivity of the experts; so, the boolean discrimination between object classes is a strong hypothesis, which may deteriorate the finality of the study. In this case, we must introduce a new comparison function, which can be founded on a partial discrimination between symbolic objects."}, {"heading": "5.2.

Discrimination matrix", "text": "We can see that the calculation of the DP and ODP functions is based on the calculation of\ng . This is done repetitively in each step. Furthermore, we know that the g function\ninvolves and operations between a set of values, and these operations are not easy operations. Therefore, this is why we need to find a way to avoid calculating the same thing many times. We will save the old calculations to reuse them in further algorithm steps. This idea can be done by the introduction of a discrimination matrix.\nThis discrimination matrix allows us to calculate only one time , and during all the\nsteps of the algorithm we will use the matrix to do all the necessary operations. This is a huge optimization of the time complexity. Also, the size of this matrix is not big, it is:\nK is not a big number, since we are dealing with classes of individuals.\nExample 5:\nLet us have Y= {y1, y2, y3, y4, y5} and A = {a1, a2, a3, a4}. At the beginning the algorithm must calculate the stopping criterion (While DP( , K) < DP(Y, K)). DP(Y, K) is the total Discrimination power of all variables of the dataset: DP(Y, K). By using (12):\n\u2208\nWe can notice that to calculate DP(Y, K), we compute all g( (ai, aj), y1), and this is done many times during the algorithm execution, so to avoid repetitive and unnecessary calculations, we decide to save, during the calculation of the stopping criterion, all g( (ai, aj), y1) values in the discrimination matrix. Each g( (ai, aj), y1) will be saved in the matrix case corresponding to row y1 and the column (ai, aj).\nAlso we will calculate for each pair of object (ai, aj), the maximum discrimination obtained by the variables. This operation is done by filling Max Yd row.\nMax Yd row is used to save: \u2208 At the beginning Max Yd is empty, and then we put the maximum value g((ai, aj),yp) of the indispensible variables yp is an indispensible variable). Here, in Table 1, y1 is indispensible."}, {"heading": "5.5. Algorithm operations using discrimination matrix", "text": "To select the variables, the Minset-Plus algorithm will use the same steps as seen in section 4. However, based on the discrimination matrix, the operations used in each step will be different and less complex. To select a new variable in each step, we have to calculate for each none selected variable . We know:\n\u2208\nWe know that the value of is saved in the discrimination matrix, and exactly in the\ncase corresponding to the row y1 and column (ai, aj). Since \u2208 calculates\nthe maximum value of for a set of variables, this value will be saved in the case\ncorresponding to the column (ai, aj). and the row Max Yd. Thus, the calculation of will take only one subtraction of numbers and one comparison to find the maximum between 2 numbers.\nIn order to find the redundant variables in each step, we will have only to calculate for each pair (ai, aj), the subtraction of the value of the case corresponding to the column (ai, aj) and row yl and the value of the case corresponding to the row ys and column (ai, aj), and then we compare\nthe value of the calculated subtraction with the value of the case corresponding to the row Max Yd of the same column (ai, aj).\nThe selection of indispensible variables is now done by using partial discrimination; therefore, the formulation of the indispensible variables will change a little bit. We can say that a variable is indispensible if we find a pair of objects discriminated totally or partially by the variable and not discriminated at all by any other variable:\nyl is indispensible if:\n\u2208\n\u2208 (15)\nExample 6:\nUsing the discrimination matrix of example 3, we have the following algorithm steps:\n Calculation of stopping criteria: the power discrimination of the all variable is calculated by doing the sum of all values in the row Max Yd.\n Finding indispensable variables.\nBy using the discrimination matrix of example 3, we can deduct that y1 and y3 are indispensables since:\n\u2208\n\u2208\nWe update MaxYd with the maximum discrimination values reached by the indispensable variables (see Table 2). By doing the summation of the values of Max Yd we get the discrimination power of the indispensable variables:\nSince the discrimination power of indispensable variable (2.5) is less than the discrimination power of all variables (3.6), we will select more variables.\n, and\nBase on the ODP values, we select the variable y4 and we update Max Yd. We update Max Yd by doing the maximum, for each pair of object (ai,aj), between the value of g(y4,(ai,aj)) and the value stored in Max Yd for this pair of object (see Table 3).

I1=(150), I2=(190), I3=(165) and I4=(170)\nIf we take into consideration only the minimum and maximum values, the symbolic object generator will generate these two symbolic objects: a1=[ height=[150 190] ] and a2=[ height=[165 170] ]\nWe can notice that the object a1 is over generalized and it extend will include the individuals of the average tall people cluster, this is why the generated interval of object a1 will be refined by taking into consideration the values of individuals of the average tall people cluster: a1=[ height=[150 165[ ]170 190] ]\n Feature selection: To compare the results, we can use the following three algorithms: Minset, Minset using partial discrimination for feature selection criterion, and Minset-Plus.\nWe have as output new symbolic objects, described with the selected variables, and we have also some quality indicators such as: the reached discrimination power, the percentage of reduction and the time of execution.\n Quality test: this module tests the quality of the new symbolic objects (objects using the selected variables). We get as output some quality indicators such as: real object extents and\npercentage of object overlapping. Base on these indicators we can change some parameters to improve the feature selection.\nUsing the described system, we did two categories of tests: Quality test and complexity test:"}, {"heading": "6.2.1. Quality Test", "text": "Assessment of the number of selected variables: we generated fifteen symbolic object datasets with overlapping percentages sliding from 0.10% to 16%. You can notice in Fig. 5, that when the overlapping percentage is low, Minset and Minset-Plus algorithm select the same number of variables. However Minset algorithm selects less variables when we increase the percentage of overlapping. Also, the number of the selected variables decreases dramatically with the increase of the overlapping percentage. When we reached 16% of overlapping percentage, no variable has been selected. In the other side, the number of selected variables of Minset-Plus algorithm decreases slightly; and sometimes it is stationary for several percentages of overlapping. This proves that the selection criterion used by Minset-Plus algorithm is more adequate than the one use by Minset algorithm, if we are dealing with overlapping clusters.\nTo understand why Minset algorithm selects fewer variables than Minset-Plus algorithm, we calculated the discriminant power (DP) for the selected variables. You can notice in Fig. 6 that the DP of variables selected by Minset is too much low than the DP of variables selected by Minset-Plus. This is due to the fact that Minset use the boolean discrimination in the selection criterion. For example, if two clusters have an intersection in only one individual among 1000 individuals, Minset considers that these two clusters are overlapped, and they cannot be discriminate by any variable. However, in the same situation Minset-Plus selects the best variables which discriminate the 999 left individuals. You can also see in Fig. 5 that around 14% of overlapping Minset-Plus has selected 10 variables and Minset selected only 1. But, in Fig. 6 you can notice that the DP reached at this level by the selected variables is: 690 for Minset-Plus and 3 for Minset.\nDuring the execution of the feature selection with Minset-Plus, we noticed that with only few selected variables the algorithm can reach between 95% and 99% of percentage of discrimination, and a big number of variables are selected in order to reach 100% of discrimination. So base on this remark, we made a new experiment, where we compare the number of selected variables of Minset-Plus at 99% of discrimination and the number of selected variables of Minset-Plus and Minset at 100% of discrimination (see Fig. 7).\nThe first finding of this experiment is that with 99% of discrimination, the number of selected variables with Minset-Plus is too much low than the number of selected variables with MinsetPlus and Minset with 100% of discrimination. In Fig. 7, we can see a gap of 10 variables between Minset-Plus 99% and Minset-Plus, and a gap of 6 variables between Minset-Plus 99% and Minset. We can notice also that the number of selected variables with Minset with 99% of discrimination is nearly the same as Minset with 100% of discrimination. The second finding of this experiment is: with the increasing of the overlapping percentage, Minset-Plus with 99% of discrimination selects mostly the same number of variables as Minset-Plus. we can see also in Fig. 7 that from 3% to 14% of discrimination, the number of selected is always 4. This can be explained be the following: Minset-Plus selects the variables using a selection criterion base on partial discrimination, this selection criterion allows to select the best variables which maximize the discriminate between the symbolic objects. So we can conclude that the selection criterion with partial discrimination is too much better than the selection criterion with boolean discrimination, especially when the overlapping is high.\nAnother category of experiment has been done to assess the quality of the selected variables. In this experiment, we used 300 individuals to generated 10 datasets. The datasets are described by 20 variables. As shown in Fig. 8, the number of objects used by the datasets varies from 10 to 100. After doing the feature selection using Minset and Minset-Plus algorithms, we generated new symbolic objects described by the selected variables. We calculated the real intersection extent average of these new objects on the 300 individuals. Finally, we compared these results with the real intersection extent average of the symbolic objects described with all variables (before selection). The purpose of this comparison is to know if the selected variables will discriminate correctly the clusters described by the symbolic objects. So a good feature selection should minimize this difference.\nWe can notice that the selected variables by Minset-Plus are too much better that those selected by Minset. Since the difference between the real intersection extent average of object used by Minset-Plus before and after selection (described only by the selected variables) is low, comparing to the corresponding value of Minset (we notice that in the dataset 10\u00d720 Minset did not select any variable because of all variable is equal to zero)."}, {"heading": "6.2.2. Complexity Test", "text": "We executed feature selection on the 10 datasets (same datasets used in the test of Fig. 8). We compared the time execution of Minset-Plus and the time execution of Minset Partial (it is the algorithm Minset, but using the partial discrimination as selection criterion. This means this algorithm did not use the mathematical properties and the discrimination matrix used by MinsetPlus to reduce the complexity). This test shows that the mathematically properties and discrimination matrix used in Minset-Plus algorithm have an impact in reducing the complexity of the algorithm.\nThe selection criterion based on partial discrimination uses complex operations, so this is why we noticed that the complexity grow exponentially when we increase the number of symbolic objects (see the time execution of Minset Partial in Fig. 9). In meantime, the time execution of Minset-Plus has grown slowly when we compare it to the time execution of Minset Partial. In the last experiment, we compared the complexity of Minset-Plus algorithm using the feature selection criterion based on partial discrimination, and Minset algorithm using feature selection criterion based on Boolean discrimination. We executed the feature selection on the same datasets used in the experiment of Fig. 9. We can notice in Fig. 10 that even when we compare Minset-Plus complexity with Minset complexity; Minset-Plus is faster than Minset, and the time execution of Minset-Plus grow slowly than the time execution of Minset."}, {"heading": "7. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper, we have presented the algorithm Minset-Plus which is an extension and improvement of the algorithm Minset. Minset-Plus is an algorithm for selecting discrimination variables on a set of symbolic objects. The use of partial discrimination allows to process deeply and in a better way the selection of the variables. Based on the discovery of some mathematical properties on ODP and DP functions, and by the use of the discrimination matrix, we obtained a huge improvement on the complexity of the algorithm.\nThe quality of the selected variables is based tightly on the function \u201cg\u201d defined in (10) and on some parameters that the expert can introduce in the algorithm to refine the selection of variables. Therefore, to appraise the robustness of this function and to measure the quality of the selected variables, we will introduce in our next research automatic validation using expert inputs.\nAlso, we plan to integrate Minset-Plus algorithm with databases, and this could be done by implementing in the algorithm as a plug-in in a database in order to access the data sets in an efficient and faster way."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "The authors would like to thank King Saud University, the college of Computer and\nInformation Sciences, and the Research Center for their sponsorship.\nAuthors\nDjamal Ziani is Professor Assistant in King Saud University in Computer Sciences and Information Systems College from 2009 until now.
