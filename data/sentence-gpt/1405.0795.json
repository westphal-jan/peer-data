The issue of belief revision has been studied in various formalisms, in particular, in qualitative algebras (QAs) in which the result is a disjunction of belief bases that is not necessarily representable in a QA. This motivates the study of belief revision in formalisms extending QAs, namely, their propositional closures: in such a closure, the result of belief revision belongs to the formalism of the QA itself. Thus the idea that this closure, in conjunction with the formalism of QA, is not necessarily representable in a QA is not necessarily representable in a QA. The possibility that this closure, in combination with the formalism of QA, is not necessarily representable in a QA is not necessarily representable in a QA. Therefore the idea that this closure, in conjunction with the formalism of QA, is not necessarily representable in a QA is not necessarily representable in a QA.

One way to study this issue following a knowledge representation angle is to consider a formalism and to study some belief revision operators defined on it: how they are defined and how they can be implemented.\nIn particular, it is rather simple to define a revision operator on a qualitative algebra (such as the Allen algebra) by reusing the work of Condotta et al. (2010) about the related issue of belief merging. The result of such a belief revision is a set of belief bases to be interpreted disjunctively, and which is not necessarily representable as a sole belief base: qualitative algebras are not closed under disjunction.\n\u2217This technical report constitutes an extended version of Dufour-Lussier et al.

A formula \u03d5 is an element of L. |= is called the entailment relation. For \u03d51, \u03d52 \u2208 L, \u03d51 \u2261 \u03d52 means that \u03d51 |= \u03d52 and \u03d52 |= \u03d51 and is read \u201c\u03d51 and \u03d52 are equivalent\u201d.\nThe entailment relation of the formalisms used in this paper can always be characterized as follows\u2014according to a model-theoretic semantics with a class of interpretations that is a set: It is assumed that there is a set \u2126 whose elements are called the interpretations. There is a relation also denoted by |= on \u2126 \u00d7 L. If \u03c9 |= \u03d5, for \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 and \u03d5 \u2208 L, \u03c9 is said to be a model of \u03d5. The set of models of \u03d5 is called by M(\u03d5). Therefore, the entailment relation is defined as follows: for \u03d51, \u03d52 \u2208 L, \u03d51 |= \u03d52 if M(\u03d51) \u2286 M(\u03d52).

Thus, the formalism is simplified, without loss of expressiveness, by removing such useless parentheses. It is also commutative wrt equivalence.\nA knowledge base KB is a finite subset of L. It is assimilated as the conjunction of its elements.\nA formalism (L, |=) is closed under disjunction if for any \u03d51, \u03d52 \u2208 L there exists \u03d5 \u2208 L such that M(\u03d5) = M(\u03d51) \u222aM(\u03d52); then \u03d5 is unique up to equivalence and is written \u03d51 \u2228 \u03d52. \u2228 is commutative and associative wrt equivalence.\nA formalism (L, |=) is closed under negation if for any \u03d51 \u2208 L there exists \u03d5 \u2208 L such that M(\u03d5) = \u2126 \\M(\u03d51); then \u03d5 is unique up to equivalence and is denoted by \u00ac\u03d51.\nA formalism (L, |=) is propositionally closed if it is closed under conjunction and negation.

In the following, when the context is explicit, hats will be omitted (|= and \u2261 instead of |\u0302= and \u2261\u0302).\nLet us consider a propositionally closed formalism (L, |=). An atom is a formula without any occurrence of the symbols \u00ac, \u2228 and \u2227 (e.g. in propositional logic, atoms are propositional variables). A literal either is an atom (positive literal) or is of the form \u00aca where a is an atom (negative literal). A formula is under disjunctive normal form (DNF) if it is a disjunction of conjunctions of literals. Every formula\u03d5 is equivalent to a formula under DNF.

In particular, the representation of knowledge by graphs (namely, qualitative constraint networks) is not well-suited here, because of the propositional closure introduced afterwards.\nFirst, the Allen algebra is introduced: it is one of the most famous QAs and it will be used in our examples throughout the paper.

The set of relations is denoted by R, which is of cardinality |R| = 2|B|. The relation in which all the base relations occur is named ?. The relation r1 \u2223\u2223 . . . \u2223\u2223 rm with m = 0 is named !.\nA finite set of symbols V , disjoint from B, is given.

A formula \u03d5 is a conjunction of n constraints (n \u2265 1): x1 r1 y1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 xn rn yn. A constraint of \u03d5 is one of the constraints of this conjunction. Let LQA be the set of the formulas of the considered QA. The atoms of LQA are the constraints.\nA formula \u03d5 \u2208 LQA is under normal form if for every x, y \u2208 V with x 6= y, there is exactly one r \u2208 R such that x r y is a constraint of \u03d5. Then, this relation r is denoted by r\u03d5(x, y).\nA scenario \u03c3 is a formula under normal form such that, for every variables x and y, x 6= y, r\u03c3(x, y) \u2208 B. Therefore, there are |B||V|\u00d7(|V|\u22121) scenarios.

The semantics will be described twice. The two descriptions correspond to the same entailment relation, but serve different purposes. The first one gives a semantics based on a domain D on which the relations are interpreted, but the class of interpretations for this semantics is difficult to use for the purpose of the paper. This motivates a second semantics, defining a finite set \u2126 of interpretations, where an interpretation is a consistent scenario and on which a distance function can be easily defined.\nSemantics based on a domain D. The semantics of the Allen algebra given in figure 1(b) exemplifies this section.\nLet D be a nonempty set, and let \u00b7\u0303 be a mapping that associates to each r \u2208 B a relation r\u0303 on D (r\u0303 \u2286 D2) such that:\n\u2022 B\u0303 = {r\u0303 | r \u2208 B} is a partition of D2: for each (d, e) \u2208 D2 there is exactly one r \u2208 B such that (d, e) \u2208 r\u0303. Furthermore, each r\u0303 \u2208 B\u0303 is nonempty.\n\u2022 For each r \u2208 B there exists exactly one s \u2208 B such that s\u0303 is the inverse of the relation r\u0303. In the following, s is denoted by r\u2212.\n\u2022 There is a base relation, denoted by eq, that is interpreted as the equality on D: e\u0303q = {(d, d) | d \u2208 D}. eq is its own inverse: eq\u2212= eq.\nThis mapping is extended on R as follows:\nif r \u2208 R and r = r1 \u2223\u2223 . . . \u2223\u2223 rm then r\u0303 = r\u03031 \u222a . . . \u222a r\u0303m\nIn other words: (d, e) \u2208 r\u0303 iff there exists i \u2208 {1, . . . ,m} such that (d, e) \u2208 r\u0303i. An interpretation I is a mapping from V to D. I is a model of x r y if (I(x), I(y)) \u2208 r\u0303. I satisfies a conjunction of constraints if it satisfies every constraint in the conjunction. A formula \u03d5 is consistent if there exists an interpretation satisfying it. Finally, \u03d51 |= \u03d52 if every interpretation that satisfies \u03d51 also satisfies \u03d52.\nAccording to this semantics, any constraint of the form x ? y is a tautology and any constraint of the form x ! y is inconsistent. Moreover, any formula \u03d5 is equivalent to a formula \u03d5\u2032 under normal form.1 Thus, in the following of the paper, all the formulas of \u03d5 are assumed to be under normal form, without lost of expressiveness.\nSemantics defined by consistent scenarios. The semantics can be characterized a posteriori thanks to consistent scenarios.\nLet \u2126 be the set of consistent scenarios on the variables of V . It can be easily proven that |\u2126| \u2264 |B||V|\u00d7(|V|\u22121)/2: if x r y is a constraint of a consistent scenario \u03c3 then y r\u2212 x is also a constraint of \u03c3.\nLet M : L \u2192 2\u2126 be defined by\nM(\u03d5) = {\u03c3 \u2208 \u2126 | \u03c3 |= \u03d5}\nfor \u03d5 \u2208 L, where |= is the entailment relation defined below, thanks to the semantics based on a domain.\n\u2126 and M make it possible to define a semantics on L which coincides with the semantics based on a domain (hence the same entailment relation |=). However, this second semantics is more practical to use for the definition of revision on QAs.\nInferences. The main inference about QAs used in this paper is the test of consistency.\nIt is usually implemented in the following way. Properties on formulas named arc consistency and path consistency are defined. Having those properties are a necessary condition and, in most algebras, a sufficient condition for scenarios to be consistent (a scenario \u03c3 is consistent iff it is arc-consistent and path-consistent). A way to test if \u03d5 \u2208 LQA is consistent is to test whether there exists \u03c3 \u2208 Scen(\u03d5) that is consistent.\nA formula \u03d5 \u2208 LQA is arc-consistent if:\n\u2022 For all 2 variables x, y \u2208 V , r\u03d5(x, y) 6= !.\n\u2022 For all 2 variables x, y \u2208 V , r\u03d5(x, y) = r\u03d5(y, x)\u2212.\nThe definition of path consistency is based on a binary operation on R, written ;. It is defined on B (for example by a |B| \u00d7 |B| table) and extended on R thanks to the equalities\n(r1 \u2223\u2223 . . . \u2223\u2223 rm) ; s = (r1 ; s) \u2223\u2223 . . . \u2223\u2223 (rm ; s) s ; (r1 \u2223\u2223 . . . \u2223\u2223 rm) = (s ; r1) \u2223\u2223 . . . \u2223\u2223 (s ; rm)\nIn LAllen, ; corresponds to the classical composition of relations: s\u0303 ; r = s\u0303 \u25e6 r\u0303 (i.e. I |= x s ; r y if there exists d \u2208 D such that (I(x), d) \u2208 r\u0303 and (d, I(y)) \u2208 s\u0303). In some other QAs, ; corresponds to a different operation, called the weak composition (Renz and Ligozat, 2005; Ligozat and Renz, 2004).\nA formula \u03d5 \u2208 LQA is path-consistent if, for all 3 variables x, y, z \u2208 V , the constraint deduced by composition between x and z (x r\u03d5(y, z) ; r\u03d5(x, y) z) is weaker than the constraint stated in \u03d5 (i.e. x r\u03d5(x, z) z).\n1This can be proven by considering, for any x, y \u2208 V , x 6= y, the set Rxy of relations r such that x r y is a constraint of \u03d5. If R = \u2205, let Cxy be the constraint x ? y. Else, let rxy be the relation constituted of the base relations that occur in all relations of Rxy (for example, if Rxy = {b \u2223 \u2223 m \u2223 \u2223 o, m \u2223 \u2223 o \u2223 \u2223 s} then rxy = m \u2223 \u2223 o). Then, Cxy is the constraint x rxy y. Finally, the formula \u2227\nx,y\u2208V,x 6=y\nCxy is a formula under\nnormal form equivalent to \u03d5."}, {"heading": "Belief change", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Belief revision", "text": "is an operation of belief change. Intuitively, given the set of beliefs \u03c8 an agent has about a static world, it consists in considering the change of their beliefs when faced with a new set of beliefs \u00b5, assuming that \u00b5 is considered to be unquestionable by the agent. The resulting set of beliefs is noted \u03c8 \u2214 \u00b5, and depends on the choice of a belief revision operator \u2214. In Alchourr\u00f3n et al. (1985), the principle of minimal change has been stated and could be formulated as follows: \u03c8 is minimally changed into \u03c8\u2032 such that the conjunction of \u03c8\u2032 and \u00b5 is consistent, and the result of the revision is this conjunction. Hence, there is more than one possible \u2214 operator, since the definition of \u2214 depends on how belief change is \u201cmeasured\u201d. More precisely, the minimal change principle has been formalized by a set of postulates, known as the AGM postulates\u2014after the names of Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson (1985). Peppas (2008) presents a detailed survey of belief revision at a general level (for any formalisms satisfying some general properties, such as closure under conjunction) including some representation theorems and the discussion of certain related issues (other belief change operators, etc.).\nIn Katsuno and Mendelzon (1991b), revision has been studied in the framework of propositional logic (with a finite set of variables). The AGM postulates are translated into this formalism as follows (\u03c8, \u03c81, \u03c82, \u00b5, \u00b51, \u00b52 and \u03c6 are propositional formulas):\n(\u22141) \u03c8 \u2214 \u00b5 |= \u00b5.\n(\u22142) If \u03c8 \u2227 \u00b5 is consistent then \u03c8 \u2214 \u00b5 \u2261 \u03c8 \u2227 \u00b5.\n(\u22143) If \u00b5 is consistent then \u03c8 \u2214 \u00b5 is consistent.\n(\u22144) If \u03c81 \u2261 \u03c82 and \u00b51 \u2261 \u00b52 then \u03c81 \u2214 \u00b51 \u2261 \u03c82 \u2214 \u00b52.\n(\u22145) (\u03c8 \u2214 \u00b5) \u2227 \u03c6 |= \u03c8 \u2214 (\u00b5 \u2227 \u03c6).\n(\u22146) If (\u03c8 \u2214 \u00b5) \u2227 \u03c6 is consistent then \u03c8 \u2214 (\u00b5 \u2227 \u03c6) |= (\u03c8 \u2214 \u00b5) \u2227 \u03c6.\nMoreover, a family of revision operators is defined based on distance functions d on \u2126, where \u2126 is the set of interpretations: the revision of \u03c8 by \u00b5 according to \u2214d (\u03c8 \u2214d \u00b5) is such that\nM(\u03c8 \u2214d \u00b5) = {\u03c9 \u2208 M(\u00b5) | d(M(\u03c8), \u03c9) = d\u2217}\nwith d\u2217 = d(M(\u03c8),M(\u00b5)) (2)\nIntuitively, d\u2217 measures, using d, the minimal modification of \u03c8 into \u03c8\u2032 needed to make \u03c8\u2032 \u2227 \u00b5 consistent.\nIt appears that it is not required for d to be a true distance function, i.e. symmetry and triangular inequality are not required: if d verifies the separation postulate, then \u2214d verifies postulates (\u22141\u20136). This approach can be extended to other formalisms for which a model-theoretic semantics can be defined such that a distance function can be defined on the set of interpretations \u2126. However, in some of these formalisms, a representability issue can be raised: it may occur that a subset \u03a3 of \u2126 is not representable, i.e. there is no formula \u03d5 such that M(\u03d5) = \u03a3. This representability issue is addressed below, for the case of qualitative algebras.\nBelief revision has been applied to the issue of the adaptation process of a casebased reasoning system (Cojan and Lieber, 2012; Dufour-Lussier et al., 2013)."}, {"heading": "Belief contraction", "text": "is the operation of belief change that associates to a set of beliefs \u03c8 and a set of beliefs \u00b5, a set of beliefs \u03c8 \u00b4 \u00b5 such that \u03c8 \u00b4 \u00b5 6|= \u00b5.

Given some sets of beliefs \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8n, their merging is a set of beliefs \u03a8 that contains \u201cas much as possible\u201d of the beliefs in the \u03c8i\u2019s. Intuitively, \u03a8 is the conjunction of \u03c8\u20321, . . . , \u03c8 \u2032 n such that each \u03c8i has been minimally modified into \u03c8\u2032i in order to make this conjunction consistent. Some postulates of belief merging have been proposed and discussed (Konieczny and P\u00e9rez, 2002), in a similar way as the AGM postulates.\nIn practice, studies on belief merging are often easy to reuse for belief revision: the revision of\u03c8 by \u00b5 can be seen as a kind of merging of\u03c8 and \u00b5 such that no modification is allowed on \u00b5.\nFor instance, belief merging has been studied for qualitative algebras by Condotta et al. (2010) and Wallgr\u00fcn and Dylla (2010). Wallgr\u00fcn and Dylla have proposed syntax-based revision operators for qualitative algebras. Those operators do not obey the AGM postulates\u2014most importantly, the syntax-independance postulate. Therefore, their work cannot serve as a base for developping a model distance-based, AGM revision operator. Condotta et al., on the other hand, proposed both syntax and semantic-based operators. The latter can be used as a base to create corresponding revision operators.\nBelief revision in qualitative algebras\nIn Condotta et al. (2010) a belief merging operator is defined which is based on a distance function d on scenarios, defined as follows. Let \u03b4 be a distance function on B. Let \u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208 \u2126, be two scenarios based on the same set of variables V . Then, d is defined by\nd(\u03c3, \u03c4) = \u2211\nx,y\u2208V,x 6=y\n\u03b4(r\u03c3(x, y), r\u03c4 (x, y))\nOne of the possibilities for \u03b4 is the use of a neighborhood graph, i.e. a connected, undirected graph whose vertices are the base relations and such that \u03b4(r, s) is the length of the shortest path between r and s. Figure 2 presents such a graph for the Allen algebra. Then, the models of the merging of \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8n is the set of scenarios \u03c3 that minimizes \u2211n i=1 d(M(\u03c8i), \u03c3) (other aggregation functions than the sum can also be used). The representability issue can be raised since the set of the optimal scenarios is not necessarily representable in (LQA, |=). One solution to address this issue is to find a formula \u033a \u2208 LQA whose set of models includes closely the set of optimal models. Another solution is to consider that the result of merging is a set of scenarios.\nThis representability issue is also raised for revision in LQA, and the second type of solution is used: for \u03c8, \u00b5 \u2208 LQA, \u03c8 \u2214\nd \u00b5 is the set of the scenarios that are the closest to M(\u03c8).\nIn Dufour-Lussier et al. (2012) and Dufour-Lussier et al. (2013), an algorithm for \u2214\nd in a qualitative algebra (LQA, |=) is defined and its implementation in the system REVISOR/QA\u2014for three QAs\u2014is described. Its inputs are \u03c8 and \u00b5, which are in LQA. Its output is the set of the scenarios \u03c3 \u2208 M(\u00b5) such that d(M(\u03c8), \u03c3) is minimal. Its principle is based on an A* search (Pearl, 1984) with an admissible heuristics. For this search:\n\u2022 A state is a \u03d5 \u2208 LQA.\n\u2022 The initial state is \u00b5.\n\u2022 A successor of a state \u03d5 is a state \u03d5\u2032 obtained by substituting in \u03d5 a constraint x r1 \u2223\u2223 . . . \u2223\u2223 rm y (m \u2265 2) with a (more specific) constraint x rk y (1 \u2264 k \u2264 m).\n\u2022 A final state is a consistent scenario.\n\u2022 The heuristic cost function is an estimation of the distance from \u03c8 to the state \u03d5 (estimation that is exact on final states).\nA slight modification wrt the classical A* algorithm is that the search stops after all the states at minimal cost have been generated\u2014not as soon as a first final state is found. The result is the set of final states \u03d5 which are the models of \u00b5 that are the closest to models of \u03c8 according to d. It can be noticed that the cost of a final state generated by an A* search is d\u2217 (as defined in (2)).\nThe worst-case complexity of this algorithm depends on the amount of scenarios in\n\u00b5, which is of the order of O ( |B| |V |\u00b7(|V |\u22121) 2 ) .\nHu\u00e9 and Westphal (2012) have also implemented a family of revision operators on QAs. Their search algorithm is based on the GQR reasoner (Gantner et al., 2008), which does not use a heuristic search but, on the other hand, takes advantage of the existence of pre-convex relations\u2014which under certain circumstances make it possible to guarantee consistency without having to compute scenarios."}, {"heading": "Motivations", "text": "Let us consider the following formulas of LAllen:\n\u03c8 = x eq y \u2227 y eq z\n\u00b5 = x d z \u2227 z di x\nThe set of models of \u00b5 that are the closest to models of \u03c8 according to d is \u03a3 = {\u03c31, \u03c32, \u03c33, \u03c34} with\n\u03c31 = \u00b5 \u2227 x d y \u2227 y di x \u2227 y eq z \u2227 z eq y\n\u03c32 = \u00b5 \u2227 x s y \u2227 y si x \u2227 y f z \u2227 z fi y\n\u03c33 = \u00b5 \u2227 x f y \u2227 y fi x \u2227 y s z \u2227 z si y\n\u03c32 = \u00b5 \u2227 x eq y \u2227 y eq x \u2227 y d z \u2227 z di y\nand it can be proven that no formula \u033a of the Allen algebra is such that M(\u033a) = \u03a3.2 So, the representability issue is raised: \u2214d in LAllen does not match exactly equation (2). Thus, either \u03c8 \u2214d \u00b5 gives a result outside of LAllen or \u03c8 \u2214\nd \u00b5 gives a formula \u033a that approximates the equality (2). By contrast,\u2214d defined by this equality can be defined in the propositional closure of the Allen algebra (which is a consequence of proposition 1, given in the next section), and this gives a first motivation for this work.\nThe second motivation is linked to the expressiveness of the formalisms: some knowledge are more easily represented in the propositional closure of a QA. An example will be presented that is formalized using both LAllen and its propositional closure L\u0302Allen. It appears to be much simpler (or \u201cmore natural\u201d) to formalize it in L\u0302Allen. Moreover, still on this particular example, the computing time of the revision is shorter in the more expressive formalism L\u0302Allen, with the systems we have implemented.\nThe third motivation of this work is that a revision operator on the propositional closure of a QA can be used in the definition of a contraction operator, thanks to (3), which requires disjunction and negation connectors.\nPropositional closure of a qualitative algebra\nLet (LQA, |=) be a qualitative algebra. The propositional closure of this formalism, as\ndefined in the preliminaries, is (L\u0302QA, |\u0302=).\nProposition 1 (representability). Every set of scenarios \u03a3 \u2286 \u2126 is representable in L\u0302QA. More precisely, with \u03d5 = \u2228\n\u03c3\u2208\u03a3\n\u03c3, M(\u03d5) = \u03a3.\nProof. First, it is proven that\nfor any \u03c3 \u2208 \u2126, M(\u03c3) = {\u03c3} (4)\n\u03c3 \u2208 M(\u03c3) is a direct consequence of \u03c3 |= \u03c3, thus it is sufficient to prove that each \u03c4 \u2208 \u2126 such that \u03c4 6= \u03c3 is not a model of \u03c3. \u03c4 6= \u03c3 implies that there exists x, y \u2208 V and r, s \u2208 B with r 6=s such that x r y and x s y are respectively a constraint of \u03c3\n2To prove this, first, let us consider the formula\n\u03d5 = \u00b5 \u2227 x d \u2223 \u2223s \u2223 \u2223f \u2223 \u2223eq y \u2227 y di \u2223 \u2223si \u2223 \u2223fi \u2223 \u2223eq x \u2227\ny d \u2223 \u2223s \u2223 \u2223f \u2223 \u2223eq z \u2227 z di \u2223 \u2223si \u2223 \u2223fi \u2223 \u2223eq y\n\u03d5 is such that \u03a3 \u2286 M(\u03d5) and for each \u03c7 \u2208 LAllen, if \u03a3 \u2286 M(\u03c7) then \u03d5 |= \u03c7 (\u03d5 is the most specific formula whose set of models contains \u03a3). Now, \u03a3 6= M(\u03d5) since, for instance, the following consistent scenario belongs to M(\u03d5) and not to \u03a3:\n\u03c3 = \u00b5 \u2227 x d y \u2227 y di x \u2227 y d z \u2227 z d y\nTherefore, there is no \u033a \u2208 LAllen such that M(\u033a) = \u03a3.\nand of \u03c4 . Since r\u0303 \u2229 s\u0303 = \u2205 (B\u0303 being a partition of \u2126) and \u03c4 |= x s y, \u03c4 6|= x r y, and therefore, \u03c4 6|= \u03c3, which proves (4).\nFrom (4) and the semantics of \u2228, it comes that M(\u03d5) = \u22c3 \u03c3\u2208\u03a3M(\u03c3) = \u22c3\n\u03c3\u2208\u03a3{\u03c3} = \u03a3, which proves the proposition.\nEvery formula of L\u0302QA can be written in DNF, since it is a propositionally closed formalism, but the following proposition goes beyond that.\nProposition 2 (normal forms). Let \u03d5 \u2208 L\u0302QA. \u03d5 can be put under the following forms:\nDNF-w/oN form \u03d5 is equivalent to a formula in DNF using no negation symbol.\nDNF-w/oN-B form \u03d5 is equivalent to a formula in DNF using no negation symbol and such that its constraints contain only base relations.\nProof. DNF-w/oN form. Let \u03d51 be a formula under DNF equivalent to \u03d5 (it exists: cf. the section on preliminaries). Therefore \u03d51 has the form \u03d51 = \u2228 i \u2227 j \u2113ij where \u2113ij is either a constraint (positive literal) or the negation of a constraint (negative literal). Let \u00ac(x r y) be a negative literal. Let R be the set of base relations occurring in r\n(if r = r1 \u2223\u2223 . . . \u2223\u2223 rm then R = {r1, . . . , rm}) and R = B \\ R. Let s be the relation based on the relations of R. Then, it comes that:\n\u00ac(x r y) \u2261 x s y\n(for example, \u00ac(x ? y) \u2261 x ! y). Therefore every negative literal can be substituted by an equivalent positive literal and, by doing such substitutions on \u03d51, the result is a formula \u03d52, equivalent to \u03d5, which proves that \u03d5 can be put under DNF-w/oN form. DNF-w/oN-B form. First, it is proven that any constraint x r y is equivalent to a formula containing constraints based only on base relations (i.e. no occurrence of the symbol\n\u2223\u2223). If r = !, then x r y is an inconsistent formula and therefore is equivalent to any inconsistent formula, for example x r y \u2227 x s y (r, s \u2208 B, r 6=s), which is only based on base relations. If r 6= ! then r = r1 \u2223\u2223 . . . \u2223\u2223 rm with m \u2265 1 and then\nx r y \u2261 x r1 y \u2228 . . . \u2228 x rm y\nSecond, let \u03d52 be a formula equivalent to \u03d5 that is under DNF-w/oN form. By substituting in \u03d52 all the constraints by equivalent formulas based only on base relations, the resulting formula, \u03d53, is equivalent to \u03d5, and contains only base relations and no negation. Finally, \u03d53 can be put under DNF as explained in the preliminaries of the paper (i.e. according to the set of equivalences (1)) resulting in a formula \u03d54 that is under DNF-w/oN-B and which is equivalent to \u03d5.\nOther authors as well stressed the interest of being able to handle temporal constraints disjunctions, such as \u201cthe trip takes either 5 minutes (by car) or 15 minutes (by bus).\u201d These disjunctions are generally not taken into account in the existing representations of qualitative relational algebras. Some work proposed to handle disjunctions in the point algebra (Vilain and Kautz, 1986). In Gerevini and Schubert (1995), for instance, qualitative relations between intervals are represented by disjunctions of relations between the ends of the intervals\u2014e.g. \u201cthe beginning of interval y is before the beginning of interval x or the end of x is before the beginning of y.\u201d Formalisms representing temporal metric constraints are more frequent, following the proposition of Dechter et al. (1991). In Barber (2000), disjunctions of constraints are handled using a notion of temporal context. As far as we know, none of these works has addressed the issue of propositional closure, though."}, {"heading": "Belief revision in (L\u0302QA, |\u0302=)", "text": "Given a distance function d on \u2126, a revision operator on (L\u0302QA, |\u0302=) can be defined according to equation (2).

Thus, there exists \u03bd \u2208 M(\u03c8) such that d(\u03bd, \u03c9) = d\u2217. Let i and j be such that \u03bd \u2208 M(\u03c8i) and \u03c9 \u2208 M(\u00b5j).

This entails that d(M(\u03c8i), \u03c9) = d \u2217, hence the following chain of relations:\nd\u2217 \u2264 d(M(\u03c8), \u03c9) \u2264 d(M(\u03c8i), \u03c9) = d \u2217\nso d(M(\u03c8), \u03c9) = d\u2217 with \u03c9 \u2208 M(\u00b5), consequently \u03c9 \u2208 M(\u03c8 \u2214d \u00b5).\nTo conclude, \u03c9 \u2208 M(\u03c8 \u2214d \u00b5) iff \u03c9 \u2208 M (\u2228\ni,j,d\u2217 ij =d\u2217 \u03c8i \u2214\nd \u00b5j ) , which proves\nthe proposition.\nThe algorithm for \u2214d in L\u0302QA consists roughly in putting \u03c8 and \u00b5 in DNF-w/oN form then applying proposition 3 on them, using the \u2214d algorithm on LQA for computing the \u03c8i \u2214\nd \u00b5j\u2019s.

The README file associated with REVISOR/QA on the REVISOR website explains how they can be executed.\nThe first example aims at showing that some revision problems are more easily expressed in L\u0302QA than in LQA. Let us consider Zo\u00e9, a school principal that has to schedule a morning with 4 courses in biology, English, history and maths for a group of students. For this purpose, she plans to reuse the previous year schedule:\n\u03c0 = English eq 8-9 \u2227 biology eq 9-10\n\u2227 history eq 10-11 \u2227 maths eq 11-12\nstating, e.g., that the English course takes place from 8 to 9 a.m.\n3http://revisor.loria.fr\nRevisionL\u0302QA(\u03c8, \u00b5)\ninput \u03c8, \u00b5 \u2208 L\u0302QA\noutput \u033a \u2208 L\u0302QA such that \u033a \u2261 \u03c8 \u2214 d \u00b5 1 \u03c8 \u2190 DNF-w/oN(\u03c8) \u03c8 = \u2228\ni \u03c8i where \u03c8i \u2208 LQA\n2 \u00b5 \u2190 DNF-w/oN(\u00b5) \u00b5 = \u2228\nj \u00b5j where \u00b5j \u2208 LQA\n3 result\u2190 \u2205\n4 dmax \u2190 +\u221e"}, {"heading": "5 for each i and each j do", "text": "6 rev \u2190 RevisionLQA(\u03c8i, \u00b5j , dmax)\n7 if rev 6= failure then\n8 (\u033aij , d \u2217 ij) \u2190 rev // \u033aij = \u03c8i \u2214 d \u00b5j \u2208 L\u0302QA // d\u2217ij = d(M(\u03c8i),M(\u00b5j))\n9 if d\u2217ij < dmax then\nShe also has some background knowledge that she expresses first in LAllen. She knows the relation between the 4 time periods:\n\u03b21 = 8-9 m 9-10 \u2227 9-10 m 10-11 \u2227 10-11 m 11-12\nThen, she states that every course c1 has no intersection (except, possibly, on one of the boundaries) with another course c2:\n\u03b22 = \u2227\nc1,c2\u2208Courses,c1 6=c2\nc1 b \u2223\u2223 bi \u2223\u2223 m \u2223\u2223 mi c2\nwith Courses = {biology, English, history, maths}\nThen, she aims at representing the fact that each course corresponds to one of the 4 time periods. Since there is no disjunction in LAllen, she uses the following trick: asserting that each course is either equal or has no intersection (except on the boundaries) with any period:\n\u03b23 = \u2227\nc\u2208Courses,p\u2208Periods\nc eq \u2223\u2223 b \u2223\u2223 bi \u2223\u2223 m \u2223\u2223 mi p\nwith Periods = {8-9, 9-10, 10-11, 11-12}\nIn order to prevent the courses and the periods to exceed the boundaries of the morning, the variable 8-12 is introduced and the following knowledge about it is asserted:\n\u03b24 = 8-9 s 8-12 \u2227 9-10 d 8-12 \u2227 10-11 d 8-12\n\u2227 11-12 f 8-12 \u2227 \u2227\nc\u2208Courses\nc s \u2223\u2223 d \u2223\u2223 f 8-12\nLet \u03b2 = \u03b21 \u2227\u03b22 \u2227\u03b23 \u2227\u03b24. Then, the knowledge about the previous year is \u03c8 = \u03b2 \u2227\u03c0. For the current year, a new constraint is that the biology and history teachers should not meet (for some reason):\n\u03b3 = biology b \u2223\u2223 bi history\nSince the background knowledge has not changed, the knowledge about this year is \u00b5 = \u03b2 \u2227\u03b3. Thus, to propose a new schedule, Zo\u00e9 will revise \u03c8 by \u00b5. If she uses the \u2214d revision operator defined above, there are two models that consist in switching English with biology or history with maths.\nNow, Zo\u00e9 wants to formalize its knowledge in L\u0302Allen. The previous year schedule \u03c0 and the new constraint \u03b3 for the current years are kept. What changes is the representation of background knowledge: \u03b2\u0302 = \u03b21 \u2227 \u03b2\u03022 \u2227 \u03b2\u03023, with \u03b2\u03022 expressing the fact that two courses cannot occur in the same period of time\n\u03b2\u03022 = \u2227\nc1,c2\u2208Courses,c1 6=c2\n\u00ac(c1 eq c2)\nand \u03b2\u03023 expressing the fact that each course is in one of the 4 periods:\n\u03b2\u03023 = \u2227\nc\u2208Courses\n\u2228\np\u2208Periods\nc eq p\nThe revision of \u03c8\u0302 = \u03b2\u0302 \u2227 \u03c0 by \u00b5\u0302 = \u03b2\u0302 \u2227 \u03b3 also gives two models, corresponding to the two same course exchanges. (Formally, they are not the same models, since the sets of variables are different\u2014there is an additional variable in the first formalization: 8-12.)\nOur claim is that the second formalization is simpler than the first one, which has required a \u201ctrick\u201d. Furthermore, REVISOR/QA requires about 6 minutes to solve this problem (in the first formalization) whereas REVISOR/PCQA only requires about 2 minutes.\nThe second example generalizes the first one. It consists in a family of examples parametrized by n and p, where n is the number of courses and of time periods (the first example corresponds to n = 4) and p is the number of breaks during the global time period (the first example corresponds to p = 0). Moreover, the breaks in the examples are uniformally spread throughout the whole period. It has been experimented with n \u2208 {3, 4, 5} and p \u2208 {0, 1, 2}. Following similar formalizations in LAllen (with 2n+p+1 variables) and L\u0302Allen (with 2n variables), the result were the same (except for the additional variables) and the computing times are presented in table 1. The average time, for each line, is computed with series of n \u2212 1 tests with d > 0, on a computer with a 2.53GHz processor and 8GB of available memory. For example, for n = 4 and p = 1, the average distance is 14.0 for REVISOR/QA and REVISOR/PCQA and the average time is 765.125 s for REVISOR/QA and 183.945 s for REVISOR/PCQA. The average time increases with the number of variables for REVISOR/QA and for REVISOR/PCQA. For the same number of variables, REVISOR/QA is faster than REVISOR/PCQA. However, as fewer additional variables are introduced under REVISOR/PCQA, more complex problems can be solved with REVISOR/PCQA than with REVISOR/QA.\nThe third example uses a belief contraction operator. As stated by equation (3), a contraction operator can be defined based on the revision operator \u2214d. Let \u00b4d be this operator. Now let us consider the set of beliefs \u03c8 of an agent called Maurice about the dates of birth and death of famous mathematicians. Maurice thought that Boole was born after de Morgan and died before him and that de Morgan and Weierstra\u00df were\nborn the same year (say, at the same time) but the former died before the latter:\n\u03c8 = Boole d De Morgan \u2227 De Morgan s Weierstra\u00df\nwhere, Boole is the interval of time between the birth and the death of Boole, and so on. Now, Germaine, a friend of Maurice, tells him that she is not sure whether Boole was born strictly after Weierstra\u00df. Since Maurice trusts Germaine (and her doubts), he wants to make the contraction of its original beliefs \u03c8 by \u00b5 with\n\u00b5 = Boole bi \u2223\u2223 mi \u2223\u2223 oi \u2223\u2223 f \u2223\u2223 d Weierstra\u00df\nThe result, computed by REVISOR/PCQA in less than one second, is \u03c8 \u00b4d \u00b5, equivalent to the following formula:\n(Boole d De Morgan \u2227 De Morgan s Weierstra\u00df)\n\u2228 (Boole s Weierstra\u00df \u2227 De Morgan di Weierstra\u00df)\n\u2228 (Boole s De Morgan \u2227 De Morgan s Weierstra\u00df)\n\u2228\n( Boole d De Morgan \u2227 Boole s Weierstra\u00df\n\u2227 De Morgan o Weierstra\u00df\n)\nActually, the last term of this disjunction corresponds to the reality, provided that the intervals of time correspond to a year granularity.4"}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "This paper has presented an algorithm for distance-based belief revision in the propositional closure L\u0302QA of a qualitative algebra LQA, using the revision operation on LQA. This work is motivated by the fact that it gives a revision operation whose result is representable in the formalism, by the fact that some practical examples are easily represented in L\u0302QA whereas they are quite difficult to represent in LQA, and by the fact that it makes it possible to define a contraction operator thanks to the Harper identity (which requires disjunction and negation). The preprocessing of the algorithm consists in putting the formulas into a disjunctive normal form without negation. Then, proposition 3, which reduces a revision of disjunctions to a disjunction of the least costly revisions, is applied. REVISOR/PCQA is an implementation of this revision operator for the Allen algebra, INDU and RCC8.\nA first direction of research following this work is the improvement of the computation time of the REVISOR/PCQA system. One way to do it is to parallelize it, which should not be very difficult (parallelizing the main loop). A sequential optimization would consist in finding a heuristic for ranking the pairs (i, j), with the aim of starting from the best candidates, in order to obtain a low upper bound dmax sooner.\nThe approach depicted in this paper for an algorithm of \u2214d in L\u0302QA built using an algorithm of \u2214d in LQA has actually little dependence on the peculiarities of QAs (except for the fact that negations can be removed in L\u0302QA according to proposition 2). Indeed, it could be reused as such for designing an algorithm of a revision on the disjunctive closure of a formalism L, provided that an algorithm of \u2214d has been designed in L. For example, the REVISOR/CLC system has been implemented in the formalism LCLC of conjunction of linear constraints (on integers and real numbers), with a city\n4George Boole (1815-1864), Augustus De Morgan (1806-1871), Karl Weierstra\u00df (1815-1897).\nblock distance (Cojan and Lieber, 2008). However, reusing this approach for having an algorithm of \u2214d in a propositional closure L\u0302 raises additional issues. In particular, the minimal distance between sets of models (i.e. n-tuples of numbers) is not necessarily reached, thus violating the postulate (\u22143). Working on this issue is a second direction of research.\nThis paper has described an algorithm for belief revision in L\u0302QA, which can be straightforwardly used for belief contraction. The third direction of research is to study how other belief change operations can be implemented in this formalism, in particular belief merging (Konieczny and P\u00e9rez, 2002) and knowledge update (Katsuno and Mendelzon, 1991a)."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors would like to express their sincere gratitude to the reviewers of the version of this article that was submitted to KR 2014.
