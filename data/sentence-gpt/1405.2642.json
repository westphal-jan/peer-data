We introduced the knowledge base dynamics to deal with two important points: first, to handle belief states that need not be deductively closed; and the second point is the ability to declare certain parts of the belief as immutable. In this paper, we address another, radically new approach to this problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fundamental issue is that when the system is constructed, it is built on a mathematical system. This is not to say that all knowledge that is not immutable is immutable, but that it is only a function, such that knowledge may not be immutable. In particular, knowledge may be stored in a finite set of state variables.\nConsider the following basic properties:\n1) The first time a system is built, the first time it has been built, and the second time it has been built, and the third time it has been built.\nThis is the problem of learning to understand the first way around this problem. Understanding the second way around it requires a simple understanding of the first way around the problem.\nTo solve this problem, you need to first understand how to learn how to construct knowledge from the first way around it. This is illustrated in the chapter 2 \"Understanding the Second Way around the Problem,\" by which we will learn how to build knowledge from the first way around the problem.\nFigure 2: The first time a system is built, the first time it has been built.\nNow, we will first understand the second way around this problem. In the third way, we will learn how to build knowledge from the first way around the problem. To understand how to build knowledge from the first way around the problem, you need to first understand how to build knowledge from the first way around the problem.\nThe first way around this problem is that the problem is a function.\n2) There are multiple possible ways to build knowledge, such as:\na) To get a new model of knowledge, the first way around it must be called. This means that the first place that is built must be called. This means that the first place that is built must be called. This means that the first place that is built must be called. This means that the first place that is built must be called.\nThe second way around this problem is that the second place that is built must be called.

The role of abduction has been demonstrated in a variety of applications. It has been proposed as a reasoning paradigm in AI for diagnosis, natural language understanding, default reasoning, planning, knowledge assimilation and belief revision, multi-agent systems and other problems (see [47]).\nIn the concept of knowledge assimilation and belief revision (see [38]), when a new item of information is added to a knowledge base, inconsistency can result. Revision means modifying the Horn knowledge base in order to maintain consistency, while keeping the new information and removing (contraction) or not removing the least possible previous information. In our case, update means revision and contraction, that is insertion and deletion in database perspective. Our previous work [10,11] makes connections with contraction from Horn knowledge base dynamics.\nOur Horn knowledge base dynamics is defined in two parts: an immutable part (formulae or sentences) and updatable part (literals) (for definition and\nproperties see works of Nebel [35] and Segerberg [48]). Horn knowledge bases have a set of integrity constraints (see the definitions in later section). In the case of finite Horn knowledge bases, it is sometimes hard to see how the update relations should be modified to accomplish certain knowledge base updates.\nExample 1. Consider a database with an (immutable) rule that a staff member is a person who is currently working in a research group under a chair. Additional (updatable) facts are that matthias and gerhard are group chairs, and delhibabu and aravindan are staff members in group info1. Our first integrity constraint (IC) is that each research group has only one chair ie. \u2200x, y, z (y=z)\u2190 group chair(x,y) \u2227 group chair(x,z). Second integrity constraint is that a person can be a chair for only one research group ie. \u2200x, y, z (y=z)\u2190 group chair(y,x) \u2227 group chair(z,x).\nImmutable part: staff chair(X,Y)\u2190 staff group(X,Z),group chair(Z,Y).\nUpdatable part: group chair(infor1,matthias)\u2190 group chair(infor2,gerhard)\u2190 staff group(delhibabu,infor1)\u2190 staff group(aravindan,infor1)\u2190\nSuppose we want to update this database with the information, staff chair(delhibabu,aravindan), that is\nstaff chair(delhibabu,aravindan)\u2190 staff group(delhibabu,Z) \u2227\ngroup chair(Z,aravindan)\nIf we are restricted to definite clauses, there is only one plausible way to do this: delhibabu and aravindan belong to groups infor1, this updating means that we need to delete (remove) matthias from the database and newly add (insert) aravindan to the database (aravindan got promoted to the chair of the research group infor1 and he was removed from research group infor1). This results in an update that is too strong. If we allow disjunctive information into the database, however, we can accomplish the update by minimal adding wrt consistency\nstaff group(delhibabu,infor1) \u2228 group chair(infor1,aravindan)\nand this option appears intuitively to be correct. When adding new beliefs to the Horn knowledge base, if the new belief is violating integrity constraints then belief revision needs to be performed, otherwise, it is simply added. As we will see, in these cases abduction can be used in order to compute all the possibilities and it is not up to user or system to choose among them.\nWhen dealing with the revision of a Horn knowledge base (both insertions and deletions), there are other ways to change a Horn knowledge base and it has to be performed automatically also. Considering the information, change is precious and must be preserved as much as possible. The principle of minimal\nchange [21,46] can provide a reasonable strategy. On the other hand, practical implementations have to handle contradictory, uncertain, or imprecise information, so several problems can arise: how to define efficient change in the style of AGM [1]; what result has to be chosen [25,29,33]; and finally, according to a practical point of view, what computational model to support for Horn knowledge base revision has to be provided?\nSince Horn knowledge base change is one of the main problems arising in knowledge representation, it has been tackled according to several points of view. In this article, we consider the immutable part as defining a new logical system. By a logical system, we mean that it defines its own consequence relation and closure operator. Based on this, we provide an abductive framework for belief dynamics (see [3,8,50]).\nThe rest of paper is organized as follows: First we start with preliminaries along with the concept of logical system and properties of consequences operator. In Section 3, we introduce Horn knowledge base dynamics with our logical system. In Section 4, we explore the relationship of Horn knowledge base dynamics with coherence approach. In Section 5, we present how Horn knowledge base dynamics can be realized using abductive explanations. In Section 6, we give brief overview of related works. In Section 7, we make conclusions with a summary of our contribution as well as a discussion of future directions of investigation."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "A first order language consists of an alphabet A of a language L. We assume a countable universe of variables Var, ranged over x,y,z, and a countable universe of relation (i.e predicate) symbols, ranged over by A. The following grammar defines FOL, the language of first order logic with equality and binary relations:\n\u03d5 ::= x = x | a(x, x) | \u00ac\u03d5 | \u2228 \u03c6 | \u2227 \u03c6 | \u2203X : \u03c6.\nHere \u03c6 \u2286 FOL and X \u2286 V ar are finite sets of formulae and variables, respectively.\nDefinition 1 (Normal Logic Program [22]). By an alphabet A of a language L we mean disjoint sets of constants, predicate symbols, and function symbols, with at least one constant. In addition, any alphabet is assumed to contain a countably infinite set of distinguished variable symbols. A term over A is defined recursively as either a variable, a constant or an expression of the form f(t1, ..., tn) where f is a function symbol of A, n its arity, and the ti are terms. An atom over A is an expression of the form P (t1, ..., tn) where P is a predicate symbol of A and the ti are terms. A literal is either an atom A or its default negation not A. We dub default literals those of the form not A. A term (resp. atom, literal) is said ground if it does not contain variables. The set of all ground terms (resp. atoms) of A is called the Herbrand universe (resp. base) of A. A Normal Logic Program is a possibly infinite set of rules (with no infinite descending chains of syntactical dependency) of the form:\nH \u2190 B1, ..., Bn, not C1, ..., not Cm, (with m, n \u2265 0 and finit)\nWhere H, the Bi and the Cj are atoms, and each rule stands for all its ground instances. In conformity with the standard convention, we write rules of the form H \u2190 also simply as H (known as fact). An NLP P is called definite if none of its rules contain default literals. H is the head of the rule r, denoted by head(r), and body(r) denotes the set {B1, ..., Bn, not C1, ..., not Cm} of all the literals in the body of r.\nWhen doing problem modeling with logic programs, rules of the form\n\u22a5 \u2190 B1, ..., Bn, not C1, ..., not Cm, (with m, n \u2265 0 and finit)\nwith a non-empty body are known as a type of integrity constraints (ICs), specifically denials, and they are normally used to prune out unwanted candidate solutions. We abuse the not default negation notation applying it to non-empty sets of literals too: we write not S to denote {not s : s \u2208 S}, and confound not not a \u2261 a. When S is an arbitrary, non-empty set of literals S = {B1, ..., Bn, not C1, ..., not Cm} we use:\n- S+ denotes the set {B1, . . . , Bn} of positive literals in S . - S\u2212 denotes the set {not C1, . . . , not Cm} of negative literals in S . - |S| = S+ \u222a (not S\u2212) denotes the set {B1, . . . , Bn, C1, . . . , Cm} of atoms of S.\nAs expected, we say a set of literals S is consistent iff S+ \u2229 |S\u2212| = \u2205. We also write heads(P ) to denote the set of heads of non-IC rules of a (possibly constrained) program P , i.e., heads(P ) = {head(r) : r \u2208 P}\\{\u22a5}, and facts(P ) to denote the set of facts of P - facts(P ) = {head(r) : r \u2208 P \u2227 body(r) = \u2205}.\nDefinition 2 (Level mapping[4]). Let P be a normal logic program and BP its Herbrand base. A level mapping for P is a function \u2016: BP \u2192 N of ground atoms to natural numbers. The mapping \u2016 is also extended to ground literals by assigning | \u00acA | = | A | for all ground atoms A \u2208 BP . For every literal ground L, | L | is called as the level of L in P.\nDefinition 3 (Acyclic program [4]). Let P be a normal logic program and \u2016 a level mapping for P. P is called as acyclic with respect to \u2016 if for every ground clause H \u2190 L1, ..., Ln (with n \u2265 0 and finit) in P the level of A is higher then the level of every Li (1 \u2264i\u2264 n). Moreover P is called acyclic if P is acyclic with respect to some level mapping for P.\nUnlike Horn knowledge base dynamics, where knowledge is defined as a set of sentences, here we wish to define a Horn knowledge base KB wrt a language L, as an abductive framework < P,Ab, IC,K >, where,\n* P is an acyclic normal logic program with all abducibles in P at level 0 and no non-abducible at level 0. P is referred to as a logical system. This in conjunction with the integrity constraints corresponds to immutable part of the Horn knowledge base, here P is defined by immutable part. This is discussed further in the next subsection;\n* Ab is a set of atoms from L, called the abducibles. This notion is required in an abductive framework, and this corresponds to the atoms that may appear in the updatable part of the knowledge; * IC is the set of integrity constraints, a set of sentences from language L. This specifies the integrity of a Horn knowledge base and forms a part of the knowledge that can not be modified over time; * K is a set of sentences from L. It is the current knowledge, and the only part of KB that changes over time. This corresponds to the updatable part of the Horn knowledge base. The main requirement here is that no sentence in K can have an atom that does not appear in Ab."}, {"heading": "2.1 Logical system", "text": "The main idea of our approach is to consider the immutable part of the knowledge to define a new logical system. By a logical system, we mean that P defines its own consequence relation |=P and its closure Cnp. Given P , we have the Herbrand Base HBP and GP , the ground instantiation of P .\nAn abductive interpretation I is a set of abducibles, i.e. I \u2286 Ab. How I interprets all the ground atoms of L 1 is defined, inductively on the level of atoms wrt P , as follows:\n* An atom A at level 0 (note that only abducibles are at level 0) is interpreted as: A is true in I iff A \u2208 I, else it is false in I. * An atom A at level n is interpreted as: A is true in I iff \u2203 clause A \u2190 L1, . . . , Lk in GP s.t. \u2200Lj (1 \u2264 j \u2264 k) if Lj is an atom then Lj is true in I, else if Lj is a negative literal \u00acBj , then Bj is false in I.\nThis interpretation of ground atoms can be extended, in the usual way, to interpret sentences in L, as follows (where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are sentences):\n* \u00ac\u03b1 is true in I iff \u03b1 is false in I. * \u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2 is true in I iff both \u03b1 and \u03b2 are true in I. * \u03b1 \u2228 \u03b2 is true in I iff either \u03b1 is true in I or \u03b2 is true in I. * \u2200\u03b1 is true in I iff all ground instantiations of \u03b1 are true in I. * \u2203\u03b1 is true in I iff some ground instantiation of \u03b1 is true in I.\nGiven a sentence \u03b1 in L, an abductive interpretation I is said to be an abductive model of \u03b1 iff \u03b1 is true in I. Extending this to a set of sentences K, I is a abductive model of K iff I is an abductive model of every sentence \u03b1 in K.\nGiven a set of sentences K and a sentence \u03b1, \u03b1 is said to be a P -consequence of K, written as K |=P \u03b1, iff every abductive model of K is an abductive model of \u03b1 also. Putting it in other words, letMod(K) be the set of all abductive models of K. Then \u03b1 is a P -consequence of K iff \u03b1 is true in all abductive interpretations in Mod(K). The consequence operator CnP is then defined as CnP (K) =\n1 the set of all the ground atoms of L, in fact depends of L, and is given as HBP , the Herbrand Base of P\n{\u03b1 | K |=P \u03b1} = {\u03b1 | \u03b1 is true in all abductive interpretations in Mod(K)}. K is said to be P-consistent iff there is no expression \u03b1 s.t. \u03b1 \u2208 CnP (K) and \u00ac\u03b1 \u2208 CnP (K).

This is formalized by the following lemma.\nLemma 1. Let KB be a Horn knowledge base, \u2264KB an order among S that satisfies (\u2264 1) to (\u2264 5).

Then \u2214 satisfies all the rationality postulates for revision (\u22141) to (\u22147).\nProof.\n(\u22141) P \u2032 = P and Ab\u2032 = Ab and IC\u2032 = IC This is satisfied obviously, since our construction does not touch P and Ab, and IC follows from every abductive interpretation in Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1). (\u22142) \u03b1 is accepted in KB \u2214 \u03b1 Note that every abductive interpretation M \u2208 Mod(KB + \u03b1) is a model of \u03b1. Hence \u03b1 is accepted in KB \u2214 \u03b1. (\u22143) \u03b1 is satisfiable and P -consistent with IC iff KB \u2214 \u03b1 is P -consistent. If part: If KB \u2214 \u03b1 is P -consistent , then Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1) is not empty. This implies that Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC) is not empty, and hence \u03b1 is satisfiable and P -consistent with IC. Only if part: If \u03b1 is satisfiable and P-consistent with IC, then Mod({\u03b1}\u222aIC) is not empty, and (\u2264 4) ensures that Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1) is not empty. Thus, KB \u2214 \u03b1 is P -consistent. (\u22144) If \u00ac\u03b1 is not accepted in KB, then KB \u2214 \u03b1 \u2261 KB + \u03b1. We have to establish that Min(Mod({\u03b1}\u222aIC),\u2264KB) = Mod(KB)\u2229Mod(\u03b1). Since \u00ac\u03b1 is not accepted in KB, Mod(KB)\u2229Mod(\u03b1) is not empty. The required result follows immediately from the fact that \u2264KB is faithful to KB (i.e. satisfies \u2264 3), which selects only and all those models of \u03b1 which are also models of KB. (\u22145) If KB \u2261 KB\u2032 and \u03b1 \u2261 \u03b2 then KB \u2214 \u03b1 = KB\u2032 \u2214 \u03b2 (\u2264 5) ensures that \u2264KB=\u2264KB\u2032. The required result follows immediately from this and the fact that Mod(\u03b1) = Mod(\u03b2). (\u22146) (KB \u2214 \u03b1) + \u03b2 implies KB \u2214 (\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2). We consider this in two cases. When \u00ac\u03b2 is accepted in KB\u2214\u03b1, (KB\u2214\u03b1)+\u03b2 is the set of all sentences from L, and the postulate follows immediately. Instead when \u00ac\u03b2 is not accepted in KB \u2214 \u03b1, this postulates coincides with the next one.\n(\u22147) If \u00ac\u03b2 is not accepted in KB \u2214 \u03b1, then KB \u2214 (\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2) implies (KB \u2214 \u03b1) + \u03b2. Together with the second case of previous postulate, we need to show that KB \u2214 (\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2) = (KB \u2214 \u03b1) + \u03b2. In other words, we have to establish that Min(Mod({\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2} \u222a IC),\u2264KB) = Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1) \u2229 Mod(\u03b2). For the sake of simplicity, let us represent Min(Mod({\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2} \u222a IC),\u2264KB) by P, and Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1) \u2229Mod(\u03b2), which is the same as Min(Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC),\u2264KB ) \u2229Mod(\u03b2), by Q. The required result is obtained in two parts: 1) \u2200 (abductive interpretation)M: if M \u2208 P , then M \u2208 Q\nObviously M \u2208 Mod(\u03b2). Assume that M <Min(Mod({\u03b1}\u222a IC),\u2264KB). This can happen in two cases, and we show that both the cases lead to contradiction. Case A: No model of \u03b2 is selected by \u2264KB from Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC). But this contradicts our initial condition that \u00ac\u03b2 is not accepted in KB \u2214\u03b1. Case B: Some model, say M \u2032, of \u03b2 is selected by \u2264KB from Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC). Since M is not selected, it follows that M \u2032 <KB M . But then this contradicts our initial assumption that M \u2208 P . So, P \u2286 Q. 2) \u2200 (abductive interpretation)M: if M \u2208 Q, then M \u2208 P M \u2208 Q implies that M is a model of both \u03b1 and \u03b2, and M is selected by \u2264KB from Mod({\u03b1}\u222a IC). Note that Mod({\u03b1\u2227\u03b2}\u222a IC) \u2286 Mod({\u03b1}\u222a IC). Since M is selected by \u2264KB in a bigger set (i.e. Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC)), \u2264KB must select M from its subset Mod({\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2} \u222a IC) also. Hence Q \u2286 P .\nBut, that is not all. Any rational revision of KB by \u03b1, that satisfies all the rationality postulates, can be constructed by our construction method, and this is formalized below.\nLemma 2. Let KB be a Horn knowledge base and \u2214 a revision operator that satisfies all the rationality postulates for revision (\u22141) to (\u22147). Then, there exists an order \u2264KB among S, that satisfies (\u2264 1) to (\u2264 5), and for any sentence \u03b1, Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1) is given in Min(Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC),\u2264KB).\nProof. Let us construct an order \u2264KB among interpretations in S as follows: For any two abductive interpretations I and I \u2032 in S, define I \u2264KB I\n\u2032 iff either I \u2208 Mod(KB) or I \u2208 Mod(KB \u2214 form(I, I \u2032)), where form(I, I \u2032) stands for sentence whose only models are I and I \u2032. We will show that \u2264KB thus constructed satisfies (\u2264 1) to (\u2264 5) and Min(Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC),\u2264KB) = Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1).\nFirst, we show that Min(Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC),\u2264KB) = Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1).Suppose \u03b1 is not satisfiable, i.e. Mod(\u03b1) is empty, or \u03b1 does not satisfy IC, then there are no abductive models of {\u03b1} \u222a IC, and hence Min(Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC),\u2264KB) is empty. From (\u22143), we infer that Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1) is also empty. When \u03b1 is satisfiable and \u03b1 satisfies IC, the required result is obtained in two parts:\n1) If I \u2208 Min(Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC),\u2264KB), then I \u2208 Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1) Since \u03b1 is satisfiable and consistent with IC, (\u22143) implies that there exists at least one model, say I \u2032, for KB\u2214\u03b1. From (\u22141), it is clear that I \u2032 is a model of IC, from (\u22142) we also get that I \u2032 is a model of \u03b1, and consequently I \u2264KB I \u2032\n(because I \u2208 Min(Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC),\u2264KB)). Suppose I \u2208 Mod(KB), then (\u22144) immediately gives I \u2208 Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1). If not, from our definition of \u2264KB, it is clear that I \u2208 Mod(KB\u2214form(I, I\n\u2032)). Note that \u03b1\u2227form(I, I \u2032) \u2261 form(I, I \u2032), since both I and I \u2032 are models of \u03b1. From (\u22146) and (\u22147), we get Mod(KB\u2214\u03b1)\u2229{I, I \u2032} = Mod(KB\u2214form(I, I \u2032)). Since I \u2208 Mod(KB\u2214 form(I, I \u2032)), it immediately follows that I \u2208 Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1). 2) If I \u2208 Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1), then I \u2208 Min(Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC),\u2264KB). From (\u22141) we get I is a model of IC, and from (\u22142), we obtain I \u2208 Mod(\u03b1). Suppose I \u2208 Mod(KB), then from our definition of \u2264KB, we get I \u2264KB I \u2032, for any other model I \u2032 of \u03b1 and IC, and hence I \u2208 Min(Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC),\u2264KB). Instead, if I is not a model of KB, then, to get the required result, we should show that I \u2208 Mod(KB \u2214 form(I, I \u2032)), for every model I \u2032\nof \u03b1 and IC. As we have observed previously, from (\u22146) and (\u22147), we get Mod(KB\u2214\u03b1)\u2229{I, I \u2032} = Mod(KB\u2214form(I, I \u2032)). Since I \u2208 Mod(KB\u2214\u03b1), it immediately follows that I \u2208 Mod(KB\u2214form(I, I \u2032)). Hence I \u2264KB I \u2032 for any model I \u2032 of \u03b1 and IC, and consequently, I \u2208 Min(Mod({\u03b1}\u222aIC),\u2264KB ).\nNow we proceed to show that the order \u2264KB among S, constructed as per our definition, satisfies all the rationality axioms (\u2264 1) to (\u2264 5).\n(\u2264 1) \u2264KB is a pre-order. Note that we need to consider only abductive interpretations from S. From (\u22142) and (\u22143), we have Mod(KB \u2214 form(I, I \u2032)) = {I}, and so I \u2264KB I. Thus \u2264KB satisfies reflexivity. let I1 \u2208 Mod(IC) and I2 < Mod(IC). Clearly, it is possible that two interpretations I1 and I2 are not models of KB, and Mod(KB \u2214 form(I1, I2)) = {I1}. So, I1 \u2264KB I2 does not necessarily imply I2 \u2264KB I1, and thus \u2264KB satisfies anti-symmetry. To show the transitivity, we have to prove that I1 \u2264KB I3, when I1 \u2264KB I2 and I2 \u2264KB I3 hold. Suppose I1 \u2208 Mod(KB), then I1 \u2264KB I3 follows immediately from our definition of \u2264KB. On the other case, when I1 <Mod(KB), we first observe that I1 \u2208 Mod(KB\u2214 form(I1, I2)), which follows from definition of \u2264KB and I1 \u2264KB I2. Also observe that I2 <Mod(KB). If I2 were a model of KB, then it follows from (\u22144) that Mod(KB \u2214 form(I1, I2)) = Mod(KB)\u2229{I1, I2} = {I2}, which is a contradiction, and so I2 <Mod(KB). This, together with I2 \u2264KB I3, implies that I2 \u2208 Mod(KB \u2214 form(I2, I3)). Now consider Mod(KB+ form(I1, I2, I3)). Since \u2214 satisfies (\u22142) and (\u22143), it follows that this is a non-empty subset of {I1, I2, I3}. We claim that Mod(KB \u2214 form(I1, I2, I3))\u2229{I1, I2} can not be empty. If it is empty, then it means that Mod(KB \u2214 form(I1, I2, I3)) = {I3}. Since \u2214 satisfies (\u22146) and (\u22147), this further implies that Mod(KB \u2214 form(I2, I3)) = Mod(KB \u2214 form(I1, I2, I3))\u2229{I2, I3} = {I3}. This contradicts our observation that I2 \u2208 Mod(KB\u2214form(I2, I3)), and so Mod(KB\u2214form(I1, I2, I3))\u2229{I1, I2} can not be empty. Using (\u22146) and (\u22147) again, we get Mod(KB\u2214form(I1, I2)) = Mod(KB \u2214 form(I1, I2, I3))\u2229{I1, I2}. Since we know that I1 \u2208 Mod(KB \u2214 form(I1, I2)), it follows that I1 \u2208 Mod(KB \u2214 form(I1, I2, I3)). From (\u22146)\nand (\u22147) we also get Mod(KB\u2214form(I1, I3)) = Mod(KB+form(I1, I2, I3))\u2229 {I1, I3}, which clearly implies that I1 \u2208 Mod(KB \u2214 form(I1, I3)). From our definition of \u2264KB, we now obtain I1 \u2264KB I3. Thus, \u2264KB is a pre-order.\n(\u2264 2) \u2264KB is total. Since \u2214 satisfies (\u22142) and (\u22143), for any two abductive interpretations I and I \u2032 in S, it follows that Mod(KB \u2214 form(I, I \u2032)) is a non-empty subset of {I, I \u2032}. Hence, \u2264KB is total. (\u2264 3) \u2264KB is faithful to KB. From our definition of \u2264KB, it follows that \u2200I1, I2 \u2208 Mod(KB) : I1 <KB I2 does not hold. Suppose I1 \u2208 Mod(KB) and I2 < Mod(KB). Then, we have I1 \u2264KB I2. Since \u2214 satisfies (\u22144), we also have Mod(KB \u2214 form(I1, I2)) = {I1}. Thus, from our definition of \u2264KB, we can not have I2 \u2264KB I1. So, if I1 \u2208 Mod(KB) and I2 < Mod(KB), then I1 <KB I2 holds. Thus, \u2264KB is faithful to KB. (\u2264 4) For any non-empty subset F of S, Min(F ,\u2264KB) is not empty. Let \u03b1 be a sentence such that Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC) = F . We have already shown that Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1) = Min(F ,\u2264KB). Since, \u2214 satisfies (\u22143), it follows that Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1) is not empty, and thus Min(F ,\u2264KB) is not empty. (\u2264 5) If KB \u2261 KB\u2032, then \u2264KB=\u2264KB\u2032. This follows immediately from the fact that \u2214 satisfies (\u22145).\nThus, the order among interpretations \u2264KB, constructed as per our definition, satisfies (\u2264 1) to (\u2264 5), and Mod(KB \u2214\u03b1) = Min(Mod({\u03b1}\u222a IC),\u2264KB).\nSo, we have a one to one correspondence between the axiomatization and the construction, which is highly desirable, and this is summarized by the following representation theorem.\nTheorem 1. Let KB be revised by \u03b1, and KB \u2214 \u03b1 be obtained by the construction discussed above. Then, \u2214 is a revision operator iff it satisfies all the rationality postulates (\u22141) to (\u22147).\nProof.

The Levi and Harper identities still holds in our case, and is discussed in the sequel.\nRelationship between contraction and revision\nContraction and revision are related to each other. Given a contraction function \u2212\u0307, a revision function \u2214 can be obtained as follows:\n(Levi Identity) Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1) = Mod(KB\u2212\u0307\u00ac\u03b1) \u2229Mod(\u03b1)\nThe following theorem formally states that Levi identity holds in our approach.\nTheorem 2. Let \u2212\u0307 be a contraction operator that satisfies all the rationality postulates (\u2212\u03071) to (\u2212\u03078). Then, the revision function \u2214, obtained from \u2212\u0307 using the Levi Identity, satisfies all the rationality postulates (\u22141) to (\u22147). .\nSimilarly, a contraction function \u2212\u0307 can be constructed using the given revision function \u2214 as follows:\n(Harper Identity) Mod(KB\u2212\u0307\u03b1) = Mod(KB) \u222aMod(KB \u2214 \u00ac\u03b1)\nTheorem 3.

As in the case of revision, this construction says what should be the models of the resulting Horn knowledge base, and does not explicitly say what the resulting Horn knowledge base is.\nRepresentation theorem\nSince the construction for contraction is based on a rational contraction for revision, the following lemmae and theorem follow obviously.\nLemma 3. Let KB be a Horn knowledge base, \u2264KB an order among S that satisfies (\u2264 1) to (\u2264 5). Let a contraction operator \u2212\u0307 be defined as: for any sentence \u03b1, Mod(KB\u2212\u0307\u03b1) = Mod(KB) \u222aMin(Mod({\u00ac\u03b1} \u222a IC),\u2264KB).

Let KB be a Horn knowledge base and \u2212\u0307 a contraction operator that satisfies all the rationality postulates for contraction (\u2212\u03071) to (\u2212\u03078). Then, there exists an order \u2264KB among S, that satisfies(\u2264 1) to (\u2264 5), and for any sentence \u03b1, Mod(KB\u2212\u0307\u03b1) is given as Mod(KB) \u222aMin(Mod({\u00ac\u03b1} \u222a IC),\u2264KB).\nProof.

Then \u2212\u0307 is a contraction operator iff it satisfies all the rationality postulates (\u2212\u03071) to (\u2212\u03078).\nProof. Follows from Lemma 3 and Lemma 4.\n4 Relationship with the coherence approach of AGM\nGiven Horn knowledge base KB =< P,Ab, IC,K > represents a belief set KB\u2022 that is closed under CnP . We have defined how KB can be expanded, revised, or contracted. The question now is: does our foundational approach (wrt classical first-order logic) on KB coincide with coherence approach (wrt our consequence operator CnP ) of AGM on KB\n\u2022? There is a problem in answering this question (similar practical problem [5]) , since our approach, we require IC to be immutable, and only the current knowledge K is allowed to change. On the contrary, AGM approach treat every sentence in KB\u2022 equally, and can throw out sentences from CnP (IC). One way to solve this problem is to assume that sentences in CnP (IC) are more entrenched than others. However, one-to-one correspondence can be established, when IC is empty.

Let KB a Horn knowledge base with an empty IC and \u2214 be a revision function that satisfies all the rationality postulates (\u22141) to (\u22147). Let a revision operator \u2217 on KB\u2022 be defined as: for any sentence \u03b1, KB\u2022 \u2217 \u03b1 = (KB\u2214\u03b1)\u2022. The revision operator *, thus defined satisfies all the AGM -postulates for revision (\u22171) to (\u22178).\nProof.\n(*1) KB\u2022 \u2217 \u03b1 is a belief set.

(*5) KB\u2022 \u2217 \u03b1 is inconsistent iff \u22a2 \u00ac\u03b1. This follows from from (\u22143) and our assumption that IC is empty.

Let KB a Horn knowledge base with an empty IC and * a revision operator that satisfies all the AGM -postulates (\u22171) to (\u22178). Let a revision function + on KB be defined as: for any sentence \u03b1, (KB \u2214 \u03b1)\u2022 = KB\u2022 \u2217 \u03b1. The revision function +, thus defined, satisfies all the rationality postulates (\u22141) to (\u22147).\nProof.\n(\u22141) P,Ab and IC do not change. Obvious. (\u22142) \u03b1 is accepted in KB \u2214 \u03b1. Follows from (\u22172). (\u22143) If \u03b1 is satisfiable and consistent with IC, then KB \u2214 \u03b1 is consistent. Since we have assumed IC to be empty, this directly corresponds to (\u22175). (\u22144) If \u00ac\u03b1 is not accepted in KB, then KB \u2214 \u03b1 \u2261 KB + \u03b1. Follows from (\u22173) and (\u22174). (+5) If KB \u2261 KB\u2032 and \u03b1 \u2261 \u03b2, then KB \u2214 \u03b1 \u2261 KB\u2032 \u2214 \u03b2. Since KB \u2261 KB\u2032 they represent same belief set, i.e. KB\u2022 = KB\u2032\u2022. Now, this postulate follows immediately from (\u22176). (\u22146) (KB \u2214 \u03b1) + \u03b2 implies KB \u2214 (\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2). Corresponds to (\u22177). (\u22147) If \u00ac\u03b2 is not accepted in KB \u2214 \u03b1, then KB \u2214 (\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2) implies (KB \u2214 \u03b1) + \u03b2.

Since contraction is constructed in terms of revision, these theorems are trivial.\nTheorem 8.

The contraction function \u2212\u0307, thus defined, satisfies all the rationality postulates (\u2212\u03071) to (\u2212\u03078).\nProof. Follows from Theorem 3 and Theorem 7."}, {"heading": "5 Realizing Horn knowledge base dynamics using abductive explanations", "text": "In this section, we explore how belief dynamics can be realized in practice (see [7,10,11]). Here, we will see how revision can be implemented based on the construction using models of revising sentence and an order among them. The notion of abduction proves to be useful and is explained in the sequel.\nLet \u03b1 be a sentence in L. An abductive explanation for \u03b1 wrt KB is a set of abductive literals 2 \u2206 s.t. \u2206 consistent with IC and \u2206 |=P \u03b1 (that is \u03b1 \u2208 CnP (\u2206)). Further \u2206 is said to be minimal iff no proper subset of \u2206 is an abductive explanation for \u03b1.\nThe basic idea to implement revision of a Horn knowledge base KB by a sentence \u03b1, is to realize Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC) in terms of abductive explanations for \u03b1 wrt KB. We first provide a useful lemma.\nDefinition 4. Let KB be a Horn knowledge base, \u03b1 a sentence, and \u22061 and \u22062 be two minimal abductive explanations for \u03b1 wrt KB. Then, the disjunction of \u22061 and \u22062, written as \u22061 \u2228\u22062, is given as:\n\u22061 \u2228\u22062 = (\u22061 \u2229\u22062) \u222a {\u03b1 \u2228 \u03b2|\u03b1 \u2208 \u22061\\\u22062 and \u03b2 \u2208 \u22062\\\u22061}.\nExtending this to \u2206\u2022, a set of minimal abductive explanations for \u03b1 wrt KB, \u2228\u2206\u2022 is given by the disjunction of all elements of \u2206\u2022.\nLemma 5. Let KB be a Horn knowledge base, \u03b1 a sentence,and \u22061 and \u22062 be two minimal abductive explanations for \u03b1 wrt KB. Then,Mod(\u22061 \u2228 \u22062) = Mod(\u22061) \u222aMod(\u22062).\nProof. First we show that every model of \u22061 is a model of \u22061 \u2228\u22062. Clearly, a model M of \u22061 satisfies all the sentences in (\u22061 \u2229\u22062). The other sentences in (\u22061 \u2228\u22062) are of the form \u03b1 \u2228 \u03b2, where \u03b1 is from \u22061 and \u03b2 is from \u22062. Since M is a model of \u22061, \u03b1 is true in M , and hence all such sentences are satisfied by M . Hence M is a model of \u22061 \u2228\u22062 too. Similarly, it can be shown that every model of \u22062 is a model of \u22061 \u2228\u22062 too.\nNow, it remains to be shown that every model M of \u22061\u2228\u22062 is either a model of \u22061 or a model of \u22062. We will now show that if M is not a model of \u22062, then\n2 An abductive literal is either an abducible A from Ab, or its negation \u00acA.\nit must be a model of \u22061. Since M satisfies all the sentences in (\u22061 \u2229\u22062), we need only to show that M also satisfies all the sentences in \u22061\\\u22062. For every element \u03b1 \u2208 \u22061\\\u22062: there exists a subset of (\u22061 \u2228 \u22062), {\u03b1 \u2228 \u03b2|\u03b2 \u2208 \u22062\\\u22062}. M satisfies all the sentences in this subset. Suppose M does not satisfy \u03b1, then it must satisfy all \u03b2 \u2208 \u22061\\\u22062. This implies that M is a model of \u22062, which is a contradictory to our assumption. Hence M must satisfy \u03b1, and thus a model \u22061. Similarly, it can be shown that M must be a model of \u22062 if it is not a model of \u22061.\nAs one would expect, all the models of revising sentence \u03b1 can be realized in terms abductive explanations for \u03b1, and the relationship is precisely stated below.\nLemma 6. Let KB be a Horn knowledge base, \u03b1 a sentence, and \u2206\u2022 the set of all minimal abductive explanations for \u03b1 wrt KB. Then Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC) = Mod(\u2228\u2206\u2022).\nProof. It can be easily verified that every model M of a minimal abductive explanation is also a model of \u03b1. Since every minimal abductive explanation satisfies IC, M is a model of \u03b1 \u222a IC. It remains to be shown that every model M of {\u03b1}\u222aIC is a model of one of the minimal abductive explanations for \u03b1 wrt KB. This can be verified by observing that a minimal abductive explanation for \u03b1 wrt KB can be obtained from M .\nThus, we have a way to generate all the models of {\u03b1}\u222aIC, and we just need to select a subset of this based on an order that satisfies (\u2264 1) to (\u2264 5). Suppose we have such an order that satisfies all the required postulates, then this order can be mapped to a particular set of abductive explanations for \u03b1 wrt KB. This is stated precisely in the following theorem. An important implication of this theorem is that there is no need to compute all the abductive explanations for \u03b1 wrt KB. However, it does not say which abductive explanations need to be computed.\nTheorem 10. Let KB be a Horn knowledge base, and \u2264KB be an order among abductive interpretations in S that satisfies all the rationality axioms (\u2264 1) to (\u2264 5). Then, for every sentence \u03b1, there exists \u2206\u2022 a set of minimal abductive explanations for \u03b1 wrt KB, s.t. Min(Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC),\u2264KB) is a subset of Mod(\u2228\u2206\u2022), and this does not hold for any proper subset of \u2206\u2022.\nProof. From Lemma 6. and Lemma 5., it is clear that Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC) is the union of all the models of all minimal abductive explanations of \u03b1 wrt KB. Min selects a subset of this, and the theorem follows immediately. .\nThe above theorem 10. is still not very useful in realizing revision. We need to have an order among all the interpretations that satisfies all the required axioms, and need to compute all the abductive explanations for \u03b1 wrt KB. The need to compute all abductive explanations arises from the fact that the converse of the above theorem does not hold in general. This scheme requires an universal\norder \u2264, in the sense that same order can be used for any Horn knowledge base. Otherwise, it would be necessary to specify the new order to be used for further modifying (KB \u2214 \u03b1). However, even if the order can be worked out, it is not desirable to demand all abductive explanations of \u03b1 wrt KB be computed. So, it is desirable to work out, when the converse of the above theorem is true. The following theorem says that, suppose \u03b1 is rejected in KB, then revision of KB by \u03b1 can be worked out in terms of some abductive explanations for \u03b1 wrt KB.\nTheorem 11. Let KB be a Horn knowledge base, and a revision function \u2214 be defined as: for any sentence \u03b1 that is rejected in KB, Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1) is a non-empty subset of Mod(\u2228\u2206\u2022), where \u2206\u2022 is a set of all minimal abductive explanations for \u03b1 wrt KB. Then, there exists an order \u2264KB among abductive interpretations in S, s.t. \u2264KB satisfies all the rationality axioms (\u2264 1) to (\u2264 5) and Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1) = Min(Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC),\u2264KB).\nProof. It is easy to define a pre-order s.t. every model of Mod(KB\u2214\u03b1) is strictly minimal than all other interpretations. It is easy to verify that such a pre-order satisfies (\u2264 1) to (\u2264 5). In particular, since \u03b1 is rejected in KB, (\u2264 3) faithfulness is satisfied, and since non-empty subset of Mod(\u2228\u2206\u2022) is selected, (\u2264 4) is also satisfied.\nAn important corollary of this theorem is that, revision of KB by \u03b1 can be realized just by computing one abductive explanation of \u03b1 wrt KB, and is stated below.\nCorollary 1. Let KB be a Horn knowledge base, and a revision function \u2214 be defined as: for any sentence \u03b1 that is rejected in KB, Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1) is a non-empty subset of Mod(\u2206), where \u2206 is an abductive explanations for \u03b1 wrt KB. Then, there exists an order \u2264KB among abductive interpretations in S, s.t. \u2264KB satisfies all the rationality axioms (\u2264 1) to (\u2264 5) and Mod(KB \u2214 \u03b1) = Min(Mod({\u03b1} \u222a IC),\u2264KB).\nThe precondition that \u03b1 is rejected in KB is not a serious limitation in various applications such as database updates and diagnosis, where close world assumption is employed to infer negative information. For example, in diagnosis it is generally assumed that all components are functioning normally, unless otherwise there is specific information against it. Hence, a Horn knowledge base in diagnosis either accepts or rejects normality of a component, and there is no \u201ddon\u2019t know\u201d third state. In other words, in these applications the Horn knowledge base is assumed to be complete. Hence, when such a complete Horn knowledge base is revised by \u03b1, either \u03b1 is already accepted in KB or rejected in KB, and so the above scheme works fine."}, {"heading": "6 Related Works", "text": "We begin by recalling previous work on view deletion. Chandrabose [10,11], defines a contraction operator in view deletion with respect to a set of formulae\nor sentences using Hansson\u2019s [20] belief change. Similar to our [14] approach, he focused on set of formulae or sentences in Horn knowledge base revision for view update wrt. insertion and deletion and formulae are considered at the same level. Chandrabose proposed different ways to change Horn knowledge base via only database deletion, devising particular postulate which is shown to be necessary and sufficient for such an update process.\nOur Horn knowledge base consists of two parts, immutable part and updatable part , but focus is on principle of minimal change. There are more related works on that topic. Eiter [17] is focusing on revision from different perspective - prime implication. Segerberg [48] defined new modeling for belief revision in terms of irrevocability on prioritized revision. Hansson [20] constructed five types of non-prioritized belief revision. Makinson [31] developed dialogue form of revision AGM. Papini[39] defined a new version of Horn knowledge base revision.\nWe are bridging gap between philosophical work, paying little attention to computational aspects of database work [32,49]. In such a case, Hansson\u2019s[20] kernel change is related with abductive method. Aliseda\u2019s [2] book on abductive reasoning is one of the motivation keys. Christiansen\u2019s [12,13] work on dynamics of abductive logic grammars exactly fits our minimal change (insertion and deletion).\nIn general, our abduction theory is related to Horn knowledge base dynamics (see how abduction theory is related with other applications, respectively, reasoning [6,41,42], update[44,45], equivalence[22,42,43] and problem solving[23,30]). More similar to our work is paper presented by Bessant et al. [7], local searchbased heuristic technique that empirically proves to be often viable, even in the context of very large propositional applications. Laurent et al.[26] parented updating deductive databases in which every insertion or deletion of a fact can be performed in a deterministic way.\nFurthermore, and at a first sight more related to our work, some work has been done on \u201dcore-retainment\u201d (same as our immutable part) in the model of language splitting introduced by Parikh [37]. More recently, Doukari [16], O\u0308zc\u0327ep [36] and Wu, et al. [51] applied similar ideas for dealing with knowledge base dynamics. These works represent motivation keys for our future work. Second, we are dealing with how to change minimally in the theory of \u201dprinciple of minimal change\u201d, but current focuss is on finding second best abductive explanation [27] and 2-valued minimal hypothesis for each normal program [40]. Finally, when we presented Horn knowledge base change in abduction framework, we did not talk about compilability and complexity (see the works of Liberatore [28] and Zanuttini [52])."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "The main contribution of this work lies in showing how abductive framework deals with Horn knowledge base dynamics via belief change operation. We consider the immutable part as defining a new logical system. By a logical system, we mean that it defines its own consequence relation and closure operator.

Still, a lot of developments are possible, for improving existing operators or for defining new classes of change operators. As immediate extension, question raises: is there any real life application for AGM in 25 year theory? [18].
