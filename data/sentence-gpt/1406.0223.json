However, meaningful evaluation and selection of prediction models for end-user domains requires holistic and application-sensitive performance measures. Inspired by energy consumption prediction models used in the emerging \"big data\" domain of Smart Power Grids, we propose a suite of performance measures to rationally compare models along the dimensions of scale independence, reliability, volatility and cost. We include both application independent and dependent measures, the latter parameterized to allow customization by domain experts to fit their scenario. While our measures are generalizable to other domains, we offer an empirical analysis using real energy use data for three Smart Grid applications: planning, customer education and demand response, which are relevant for energy sustainability. Our results underscore the value of the proposed measures to offer a deeper insight into models' behavior and their impact on real applications, which benefit both data mining researchers and practitioners. Our approach integrates two of the approaches for cost efficiency in predicting a cost-effective strategy. The first approach is \"cost saving,\" which means that the cost saving of the product will be based on the assumption that the cost is cost-effective. This assumption was originally developed by Richard D. and Michael M. R. Sacks of an international energy management consultancy. The authors declare no conflict of interest.

One emerging community contending with a data explosion is Smart Power Grids. Advanced instrumentation and controls being deployed to upgrade aging power grid infrastructure is offering utilities unprecedented access to power data at fine spatial and temporal granularities, with near realtime availability 1 [30]. However, this data needs to be translated into actionable intelligence by means of novel modeling, mining and evaluation methods to ensure sustainable energy generation and supply [28].\nOne critical opportunity lies in reliably, accurately and efficiently predicting electric energy consumption for individual premises.

The impact of such predictions includes strategic planning of renewable generation, power purchases from energy markets, daily planning to meet peak power loads, and engaging customers in energy savings programs [25], [37], all of which can enhance long term energy sustainability and security.\nHistorically, data at the feeder and sub-station level have been collected using SCADA systems. Hence contemporary load forecasting models exist at the coarser spatial granularity of total utility area using Bayesian modeling [10], Support Vector Machines [9], Artificial Neural Networks [21] and time series methods [23]. However, energy consumption prediction2 for individual customers is less studied, both due to the lack of input data and the limited need for such predictions till recently with Smart Grids [16]. As a result, prediction models at the consumer level, with more intra-day and seasonal variability, and for innovative Smart Grid applications, which engage customers in sustainability, have not been well understood nor a set of performance measures for their evaluation identified.\nThe performance of prediction models are often based on \u201cabstract metrics\u201d, detached from their\n2. In this article, we address energy consumption prediction, which deals with average energy over an interval (i.e., kWh). This is different from demand (or load) prediction [2], [33] that deals with predicting instantaneous power (kW).\nar X\niv :1\n40 6.\n02 23\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 J\nun 2\n01 4\nmeaningful evaluation for the end-user domain [36]. Common performance measures like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) form the basis for selecting a suitable prediction model. However, we suggest that these measures are insufficient to evaluate prediction models for emerging Smart Grid applications. This gap, discussed below, is relevant to many applied domains beyond just Smart Grids.\n(1) The impact of under- and over- predictions can be asymmetric on the domain, and measures like RMSE are insensitive to prediction bias. For e.g., underprediction of consumption forecasts is more deleterious to Smart Grid applications that respond to peak demand. (2) Scale-dependent metrics are unsuitable for comparing prediction models applied to different customer sizes. (3) The focus on the magnitude of errors overlooks the frequency with which a model outperforms a baseline model or predicts within an error tolerance. Reliable prediction is key for certain domain applications. (4) Volatility is a related factor that is ignored in common measures, wherein a less volatile prediction model performs consistently better than a baseline model. (5) Lastly, given the \u201cBig Data\u201d consequences of emerging applications, the cost of collecting data and running models cannot be disregarded. The extra cost for improved accuracy from a model may be impractical at large scales in a Smart Grid with millions of customers [19], or the latency for a prediction can make it unusable for operational decisions. These gaps highlight the need for holistic performance measures to meaningfully evaluate and compare prediction models by domain practitioners.\nContributions. Specifically, we make the following novel contributions. (1) We propose a suite of performance measures for evaluating prediction models in Smart Grids, defined along three dimensions: scale in/dependence, reliability and cost (\u00a73). These include two existing measures and eight innovative ones (\u00a74, \u00a75), and also encompass parameterized measures that can be customized for the domain. (2) We analyze the usefulness of these concrete measures by evaluating ARIMA and regression tree prediction models (\u00a76) applied to three Smart Grid applications (\u00a77) in the Los Angeles Smart Grid Project 3.\nSignificance. In this article, we offer meaningful performance measures to evaluate predictive models along dimensions that go beyond just the magnitude of errors, and explore bias, reliability, volatility and cost [36]. Not all our measures are novel and some extend from other disciplines \u2013 this offers completeness and also gives a firm statistical grounding. Our novel application dependent measures with parameterized coefficients set by domain experts allow apples-toapples comparison that is meaningful for that scenario [12]. A model that seems good using common error\n3.

All our measures are reusable by other domains, though they are inspired by and evaluated for the emerging Smart Grid domain.\nAs Smart Grid data becomes widely available, data mining and machine learning research can provide immense societal benefits to this under-served domain [28]. Our study based on real Smart Grid data collected over 3 years 4 is among the first of its kind in defining holistic measures and evaluating candidate consumption models for emerging microgrid and utility applications. Our analysis of the measures underscores their key ability to offer: deeper insight into models\u2019 behavior that can help improve their performance, better understanding of prediction impact on real applications, intelligent cost-benefit trade-offs between models, and a comprehensive, yet accessible, goodness of fit for picking the right model. Our work offers a common frame of reference for future researchers and practitioners, while also exposing gaps in existing predictive research for this new domain."}, {"heading": "2 RELATED WORK", "text": "The performance evaluation of predictive models often involves a single dimension, such as an error measure, which is simple to interpret and compare, but does not necessarily probe all aspects of a model\u2019s performance or its goodness for a given application [36]. A new metric is proposed in [12] based on aggregating performance ratios across time series for fair treatment of over- and under-forecasting. [27] emphasizes the importance of treating predictive performance as a multi-dimensional problem for a more reliable evaluation of the trade-offs between various aspects. [15] introduces a measure to reduce the double penalty effect in forecasts whose features are displaced in space or time, compared to point-wise metrics. Further, [35] identifies the need for cost-benefit measures to help capture the performance of a prediction model by a single profit-maximization metric which can be easily interpreted by practitioners. [5] highlights the importance of scale, along with measures like cost, sensitivity, reliability, understandability, and relationship for decision making using forecasts. Other studies [32] also go beyond standard error measures to include dimensions of sensitivity and specificity. Our effort is in a similar vein. We propose a holistic set of measures along multiple dimensions to assist domain users in intelligent model selection for their application, with empirical validation for emerging Smart Grid domain.\nExisting approaches for consumption prediction include our and other prior work on regression tree [3], [26], time series models [4], artificial neural networks\n4. \u201cWhere\u2019s the Data in the Big Data Wave?\u201d, Gerhard Weikum, SIGMOD Blog, Mar 2013. wp.sigmod.org/?p=786\nand expert systems [21], [22], [23]. In practice, utilities use simpler averaging models based on recent consumption [1], [11]. In this spirit, our baseline models for comparative evaluation consider Time of the Week (ToW) and Day of the Week (DoW) averages.\nAs elsewhere, Smart Grid literature often evaluates predictive model performance in terms of the magnitude of errors between the observed and predicted values [8], [20]. Common statistical measures for time series forecasting [5] are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), the latter given by:\nMAPE = 1\nn n\u2211 i=1 |pi \u2212 oi| oi\n(1)\nwhere oi is the observed value at interval i, pi is the model predicted value, and n is the number of intervals for which the predictions are made. Mean Error Relative (MER) to the mean of the observed, has also been used to avoid the effects of observed values close to zero [23]. RMSE values normalized by the mean of observed values, called the coefficient of variation of the RMSE (CVRMSE), is also used [3], [13]:\nCV RMSE = 1\no \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a 1 n n\u2211 i=1 (pi \u2212 oi)2 (2)\nwhere o is the mean of the n observed values, and pi, oi and n are as before. While these measures offer a necessary statistical standard of model performance, they by themselves are inadequate due to the reasons listed before, viz., their inability to address predictionbias, reliability, scale independence and cost of building models and making predictions.\nSome researchers have proposed applicationspecific metrics. [24] defines metrics related to Demand-Response. The Demand Shed Variability Metric (SVM) and Peak Demand Variability Metric (PVM) help reduce over-fitting and extrapolation errors that increase error variance or introduce prediction bias. Our application-dependent (rather than -specific) measures are defined more broadly, with measure parameters that can be tuned for diverse applications that span even beyond Smart Grids.\nRelative measures help compare a prediction model with a baseline model [5]. Percent Better gives the fraction of forecasts by a model that are more accurate than a random walk model. This is a unitfree measure that is also immune to outliers present in the series, by discarding information about the amount of change. The Relative Absolute Error (RAE), calculated as a ratio of forecast error for a model to the corresponding error for the random walk, is simple to interpret and communicate to the domain users. The prediction horizon also has an impact on model performance. Cumulative RAE [5] is defined as the ratio of the arithmetic sum of the absolute error\nfor the proposed model over the forecast horizon and the corresponding error for the random walk model. Relative and horizon metrics have been used less often for smart grid prediction models.\nPrediction error metrics have been categorized into scale-dependent measures, percentage errors, relative errors and scaled errors [17]. RMSE and MAE are scale-dependent and applicable to datasets with similar values. Scale-independent Percentage errors like MAPE and CVRMSE can be used to compare performance on datasets with different magnitudes. Relative measures are determined by dividing model errors by the errors of a baseline model, while scaled errors remove the scale of data by normalizing the errors with the errors obtained from a baseline prediction method.\nIn summary, standard statistical measures of performance for predictive models may not be adequate or meaningful for domain-specific applications, while narrowly defined measures for a single application are not reusable or comparable across applications. This gap is particularly felt in the novel domain of Smart Grids. Our work is an attempt to address this deficiency by introducing a suite of performance measures along several dimensions, while also leveraging existing measures where appropriate."}, {"heading": "3 PERFORMANCE MEASURE DIMENSIONS", "text": "Performance measures that complement standard statistical error measures for evaluating prediction models fall along several dimensions that we discuss here.\nApplication In/dependent: Application independent measures are specified without knowledge of how predictions from the model are being used. These do not have any specific dependencies on the usage scenario and can be used as a uniform measure of comparison across different candidate models. Application dependent measures incorporate parameters that are determined by specific usage scenarios of the prediction model. The measure formulation itself is generic but requires users to set values of parameters (e.g., acceptable error thresholds) for the application. These allow a nuanced evaluation of prediction models that is customized for the application in concern.\nScale-Independent Errors: In defining error metrics, the residual errors are measured as a difference between the observed and predicted values. So, if oi is the ith observed value and pi is the ith predicted value, then the scale-dependent residual or prediction error, ei = pi\u2212oi. MAE and RMSE are based on residual errors, and suffer from being highly dependent on the range of observed values. Scale-independent errors, on the other hand, are usually normalized against the observed value and hence better suited for comparing model performance across different magnitudes of observations.\nReliability: Reliability offers an estimate of how consistently a model produces similar results. This\ndimension is important to understand how well a model will perform on a yet unseen data that the system will encounter in future, relative to the data used while testing. A more reliable model provides its users with more confidence in its use. Most commonly used measures fail to consider the frequency of acceptable model performance over a period of time, which we address through measures we introduce.\nCost: Developing a prediction model has a cost associated with it in terms of effort and time for data collection, training and using the models. The number of times a trained model can be reused is also a factor. Data cost is a particularly important consideration in this age of \u201cBig Data\u201d since quality checking, maintaining and storing large featuresets can be untenable. Compute costs can even be intractable when prediction models are used millions of times within short periods."}, {"heading": "4 APPLICATION INDEPENDENT MEASURES", "text": "Several standard statistical measures with well understood theoretical properties fall in the category of application independent measures.

These parameters are determined using autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions, using the Box-Jenkins test [6].\nARIMA is simple to use as it does not require knowledge of the underlying domain [4]. However, estimating the model parameters, d, p, and q, requires human examination of the partial correlogram of the time series, though some automated functions perform a partial parameter sweep to select these values.\nRegression Tree Model: A regression tree (RT) model [7] is a kind of decision tree that recursively partitions the data space into smaller regions, until a constant value or a linear regression model can be fit for the smallest partition.\nOur earlier work on an RT model for campus microgrid consumption prediction identified several advantages [3].

The RT model was trained once using MATLAB\u2019s classregtree function [7] to find an optimally pruned tree.\nARIMA Time Series (TS) Models: For 24-hour predictions, the ARIMA models are retrained and used to make predictions every week for four different prediction horizons: 1-week, 2-week, 3-week, and 4- week ahead. Unlike RT, the performance of time series models differ by the prediction horizon. We use a moving window over the past 2 years for training these models with (p, d, q) = (7, 1, 7), equivalent to a 7 day lag, selected after examining several variations. For 15-min predictions, we retrain models and predict every 2 hours for three different horizons: 2-hour, 6- hour, and 24-hour ahead. We use a moving window over the past 8 weeks for training, with (p, d, q) = (8, 1, 8), equivalent to a 2 hour lag. We used the arima function in the R forecast package [18] for constructing the time series models. This function used conditional sum of squares (CSS) as the fitting method.\nBaseline Models: For 24-hour predictions, we selected the Day of Week mean (DoW) as the baseline, defined for each day of the week as the kWh value for that day averaged over the training period (i.e., 7 values from averaging over 2008 and 2009). DoW was chosen over Day of Year (DoY) and Annual Means since it consistently out-performed them. For 15-min predictions, we selected the Time of the Week mean (ToW) as the baseline, defined for each 15-min in a week as the kWh value for that interval averaged over the training period (i.e., 7\u00d7 96 values from averaging over 2008 and 2009). Here too, ToW out-performed Time of the Year (ToY) and Annual Means."}, {"heading": "7.3 Smart Grid Applications", "text": "We introduce three applications, used within the USC microgrid, to evaluate our proposed measures.\nPlanning: Planning capital infrastructure such as building remodeling and power system upgrades for energy efficiency trades-off investment against electric power savings. Medium to long term electricity consumption predictions at coarse (24-hour) granularity for campus and individual buildings help this decision making. Such models are run six times in a year.\nCustomer Education: Educating power customers on their energy usage can enhance their participation in energy sustainability by curtailing demand and meeting monthly budgets [28]. One form of education is through giving consumption forecasts to customers in a building on web and mobile apps 12. Buildinglevel predictions at 24-hour and 15-min granularities are made during the day (6AM-10PM).\nDemand Response: Demand Response (DR) optimization is a critical technique for achieving energy\n12. USC SmartGrid Portal, smartgrid.usc.edu\nsustainability enabled by smart grids. In DR, customers are encouraged to curtail consumption, ondemand, to reduce the chance of black-outs when peak power usage periods are anticipated by the utility [24]. Historically, these high peaks occur between 1-5PM on weekdays 13, and predictions during these periods over the short time horizon at 15-min granularity are vital for utilities to decide when to initiate curtailment requests from customers or change their pricing. Often, the predictions are before, at the beginning of, and during the high peak period."}, {"heading": "8 ANALYSIS OF INDEPENDENT MEASURES", "text": "We first examine the use and value of the six application independent measures (\u00a7 4) to evaluate the candidate models for predicting campus and building consumption at coarse and fine time granularities."}, {"heading": "8.1 24-hour Campus Predictions", "text": "Fig. 1a presents the CVRMSE and MAPE measures for the DoW baseline, RT, and TS models, the latter for four different horizons, for campus 24-hour predictions. By these measures, TS models at different horizons offer higher accuracy than the RT and DoW models. This is understandable, given the noticeable difference in mean and standard deviations (Table 1) between the training and test periods. TS incrementally uses more recent data as a moving window, while RT and DoW model are only trained on the two years\u2019 test data. Also, the errors for TS deteriorate as the prediction horizon increases. This is a consequence of their dependence on recent lag values, making them suited only for near-term predictions. RT models are independent of prediction horizons (assuming future feature values are known), and therefore preferable for predictions with long horizons. The DoW errors are marginally higher than RT. This is quickly evident using our relative improvement (RIM) measure (Fig. 2a), that reports an improvement of 2.5% for RT and 58.39% for TS (1wk) over the baseline. However, when volatility is accounted for, this margin over the DoW increases to a VAB of 11.45% and 74.42% for RT and TS (1wk), making them much more dependable."}, {"heading": "8.2 24-hour Building Predictions", "text": "The CVRMSE and MAPE measures for DPT (Fig. 1b) diverge in their ranking of the RT and TS models; RT is best based on CVRMSE while TS (1wk) is best on MAPE. This divergence highlights the value of having different error measures. In CVRMSE, residual errors are squared and thus large errors are magnified more than in MAPE. Our RIM measure offers another perspective as a relative measure independent of error values (Fig. 2b). TS (1wk) is clearly more favorable than\n13. DWP TOU Pricing, bp.ladwp.com/energycredit/ energycredit.htm\nRT, performing better than the baseline in 50% of predictions (RIM \u2248 0) compared to RT (RIM=\u221219.88%). When accounting for volatility in VAB, TS (1wk) outperforms the DoW (VAB=17.62%) and even RT exhibits lesser relative volatility (VAB=4.35%). These demonstrate why multiple measures offer a more holistic view of the model performance.\nRES has 100\u2019s of residential suites with independent power controls, and hence higher consumption variability. This accounts for the higher errors in predictions across models (Fig. 1c). Further, the building is unoccupied during summer and vacation periods. Hence, it is unsurprising to see DoW perform particularly worse. (We verified the impact of summer by comparing DoW with DoY. DoY did perform better, but for consistency, we retain DoW as the baseline.) RT has lower errors than DoW as it captures schedulerelated features like holidays and summer semester. However, the test data for RES has a smaller mean than the training data (Table 1), thus skewing predictions. TS (1wk) has the smallest error due to its ability to capture changing and recent trends. The RIM (Fig. 2c) with respect to DoW is greater than 0 for all models except TS (4wk), which performs worse than the baseline 7% of the time, even as it has comparatively smaller errors. Given the high consumption variability for RES, performance under volatility is important. A high VAB is desirable and provided by all models.\nFor OFF (Fig. 1d), we again see a divergence in model ranking when based on CVRMSE or on MAPE, reflecting the benefit of each measure. Uniquely, neither RT nor TS are able to surpass the DoW baseline in terms of CVRMSE. We independently verified if the consumption pattern of this building is highlycorrelated with the DoW by examining the decision tree generated by RT, the best choice in terms of MAPE. We found the DoW feature to be present in the root node of the tree while the holiday flag was at the second level. RT is also the only model which (marginally) outperforms the baseline on RIM and VAB (Fig. 2d), thus delivering the benefits of using a feature-based approach that subsumes DoW. TS fails to do well, possibly due to temporal dependencies that extend beyond the 7-day lag period. It is notable that while DoW is the preferred model based on CVRMSE (Fig. 1d) for OFF, measures we propose, such as RIM and VAB (Fig. 2d) that evaluate performance against the DoW baseline, indicate that RT is the better choice.\nFor ACD (Fig. 1e), TS (1wk) and RT perform incrementally better than DoW on CVRMSE and MAPE, and VAB is positive for only these two models (Fig. 2e). The sharp change in standard deviation between the training and test data accounts for the higher sensitivity to volatility of the baseline (Table 1). But we observe slightly negative values of RIM for all models, implying more frequent errors than the baseline."}, {"heading": "8.3 15-min Campus Predictions", "text": "The 15-min predictions for the campus shows TS (2hr) to fall closest to the observed values, based on CVRMSE (6.88%) and MAPE (4.18%) (Fig. 3a). This accuracy is validated relative to the baseline, with high RIM and VAB values (Fig. 4a). These reflect the twin benefits of large spatial granularity of the campus, which make its consumption slower changing, and the short horizon of TS (2hr), helping it capture temporal similarity. RT is the next best, performing similar to TS (6hr) and ToW baseline on CVRMSE, MAPE and RIM, though it is better with volatility (VAB=5.21%)."}, {"heading": "8.4 15-min Building Predictions", "text": "For 15-min predictions for buildings, we see that TS (2hr) is the only candidate model that always does better than the ToW baseline on all four measures (Figs. 3b\u20133e & 4b\u20134e). TS (6hr) and RT are occasionally better than ToW on CVRMSE and MAPE, and TS (24hr) rarely. Their CVRMSE errors are also uniformly larger than MAPE, showing that the models suffer more from occasional large errors. The academic environment with weekly class schedules encourages a uniform energy use behavior based on ToW, that is hard to beat. RES is the exception, where all candidate models are better than the baseline (Fig. 3c), given the aberrant summer months when it is unused.\nHowever, when we consider the RIM and VAB measures, it is interesting to note that the candidate models are not significantly worse than the baseline (Fig. 4b\u20134e). In fact, TS (6hr) is better than ToW for all buildings but DPT, showing that it is more often accurate and more reliable under volatility. RT, however, is more susceptible to volatility and shows negative values for all buildings but RES. While TS (2hr) followed by TS (6hr) are obvious choices for short horizons, ToW and RT have the advantages of being able to predict over a longer term. In the latter case, ToW actually turns out to be a better model."}, {"heading": "8.5 Cost Measures", "text": "The data and compute cost measures, discussed here, are orthogonal to the other application-independent measures, and their values are summarized in Table 2. Making cost assessment helps grid managers ensure rational use of resources, including skilled manpower and compute resources, in the prediction process.\nData Cost (CD): The baselines and TS are univariate models that require only the electricity consumption values for the training and test periods. Hence their data costs are smaller, and correspond to the number of intervals trained and tested over. RT model has a higher cost due to the addition of several features (\u00a7 7.2). However, the cost does not increase linearly with the number of features and instead depends on the number of unique feature values. As a result, its\ndata cost is only \u223c 25% and \u223c 300% greater than TS for 24-hr and 15-min predictions respectively.\nCompute Cost (CC): We train over 2 years and predict for 4 weeks (24-hour granularity) and 24 hours (15-min) on a Windows Server with AMD 3.0GHz CPU and 64GB RAM, and report the average over 10 experiment runs. The baseline\u2019s compute cost is trivial as it is just an average over past values, and we ignore it. For the TS models, retraining is interleaved with the prediction and we report them as part of the prediction cost (CCp). We found prediction times for TS to be identical across campus and the four buildings, and the 15-min predictions to be \u223c 9\u00d7 the cost of 24-hour \u2013 understandable since there are \u223c 10\u00d7 the data points. The horizons did not affect these times. For RT, we find the training and prediction times to be similar (but not same) across campus and four buildings, and this is seen in the differences in the sizes of the trees constructed. We report their average time. While RT has a noticeable training time (17 secs for 15-min), its prediction time is an order of magnitude smaller than TS. As a result, its regular\nuse for prediction is cheaper. It is more responsive, with a lower prediction latency, even as the number of buildings (or customers) increase to the thousands."}, {"heading": "9 ANALYSIS OF DEPENDENT MEASURES", "text": "The application-dependent measures (\u00a7 5) enable model selection for specific application scenarios. For each application (\u00a7 7.3), the measures\u2019 parameter values are defined in consultation with the domain experts. These values are listed in Tables 3 & 4."}, {"heading": "9.1 Planning", "text": "Planning requires medium- and long-term consumption predictions at 24-hour granularities for the campus and buildings, six times a year. The short horizon of TS (4 weeks) precludes its use. So we only consider DoW and RT models, but do report TS results.\nCampus: For campus-scale decisions, both overand under- predictions can be punitive. The former will lead to over-provisioning of capacity with high costs while the latter can cause reduced usability of capital investments. Hence, for DBPE, we equally\nweight \u03b1 = 1 and \u03b2 = 1, whereby DBPE reduces to MAPE. We set et = 10%, a relatively lower tolerance, since even a small swing in error % for a large consumer like USC translates to large shifts in kWh.\nFig. 5a shows RT (and TS) to perform better than the DoW baseline on DBPE (6.87% vs. 7.56%, consistent with MAPE). The RT model\u2019s reliability is also higher than DoW\u2019s (Fig. 6a), with RT providing errors smaller than the threshold 60.87% of the time \u2013 a probabilistic measure for the planners to use. When we consider the total compute cost for training and running the model (Table 4), RT is trained once a year and used six times, with a negligible compute cost of 103 msec and a high CBM of 900%/sec (Fig. 5a). These make RT a better qualitative and cost-effective model for long term campus planning.\nBuildings: Buildings being upgraded for sustainability and energy efficiency favor over-prediction of consumption to ensure an aggressive reduction of carbon footprint. Reflecting this, we set \u03b1 = 0.5 and \u03b2 = 1.5 for DBPE. A higher error tolerance than campus is acceptable, at et = 15%. Cost parameters and measure values are the same as campus.\nDBPE reflects a truer measure of error for the application and we see that it is smaller than MAPE across all models and buildings (Fig 5b-5e). Investigating the data reveals that the average kWh for the training period was higher than that for the test period, leading to overpredictions. Here, the models\u2019 inclination to overpredict works in their favor. While RT is uniformly better than DoW on DBPE, it is less reliable for RES and ACD (Figs. 6c & 6e), even falling below 0%, indicating that predictions go over the error threshold more often than below the threshold.\nREL unlike DBPE treats over- and underpredictions similarly. While the baseline has fewer errors above the threshold, their magnitudes are much higher, causing DBPE (an average) to rise for smaller REL. The costs for RT are minimal like for campus and their CBMs similar. So the model of choice depends on if the predictions need to be below the threshold more often (DoW) or if the biasederrors are lower (RT). Particularly, for OFF, REL (Fig. 6d) shows RT is best for Planning even as DoW was the better model based on CVRMSE (Fig. 1d). Similarly, for ACD, REL (Fig. 6e) recommends DoW for Planning even as CVRMSE (Fig. 1e) suggests RT and MAPE (Fig. 1e) suggests TS (1wk). These highlight the value of defining application-specific performance measures like REL for meaningful model selection."}, {"heading": "9.2 Customer Education", "text": "This application uses 24-hour and 15-min predictions at the building-level made during the daytime (6AM10PM), and provides them to residents/occupants for monthly budgeting and daily energy conservation.\n24-hour predictions: 24-hour predictions impact monthly power budgets, and over-predictions are bet-\nter to avoid slippage. We pick \u03b1 = 0.75 and \u03b2 = 1.25 for DBPE and an error tolerance et = 15% for REL. We use a 4-week prediction duration for costing with one 24-hour prediction done each day by RT and TS. RT is trained once in this period. We report TCC (Table 4), DBPE & CBM (Figs. 5b-5e), and REL (Figs. 6b-6e).\nLike for Planning that preferred over-predictions, the DBPE here is smaller than MAPE for all models, and it is mostly smaller for RT and TS models than DoW. But for a building like ACD, while one may have picked TS (1wk) based on the application-independent MAPE measure (Fig. 1e), both RT and DoW are better for Customer Education on DBPE (Fig. 5e). Similarly, for both DPT and RES, TS (1wk) was the best option based on MAPE (Figs. 1b, 1c) as well as on DBPE for Customer Education (Figs. 5b, 5c). However, for a different application, such as Planning, RT is the recommended model based on DBPE (Figs. 5b, 5c). This highlights how a measure that is tailored for a specific application by setting tunable parameters can guide the effective choosing of models for it.\nWhen considering reliability, REL for RT is marginally (DPT) or significantly (OFF) better than DoW even as the application-independent RIM showed RT to be worse or as bad as DoW respectively \u2013 yet another benefit of measures customized for the application. RT also equals or out-performs TS (1wk) on both DBPE and REL on all buildings but RES. The TCC cost for TS while being \u223c 20\u00d7 more than RT is still small given the one month duration. This also reflects in the CBM being much lower for TS.\n15-min predictions: This application engages customers by giving periodic forecasts during the day to encourage efficiency. Over-predicting often or more frequent errors will mitigate a customer\u2019s interest. So we set \u03b1 = 1.5 and \u03b2 = 0.5 for DBPE, and we have a lower error tolerance at et = 10% for REL. Prediction duration is 4-weeks for cost parameters, with 8 uses per day at 2 hour horizons. RT is trained once.\nFor all buildings, both DBPE and REL rank TS (2hr) as the best model (Figs. 7b-7e) & (Figs. 8b-8e). These reaffirm the effectiveness of TS for short-term predictions. For many models, the (daytime) DBPE for this application is higher than the (all-day) MAPE due to higher variations in the day. However, TS (2hr) bucks this trend for RES, OFF and ACD. RT is worse than even ToW on reliability, with REL below 0% for all buildings. For RES, all models but TS (2hr) have REL below 0%. So qualitatively, TS (2hr) is by far a better model. However, on costs (Table 4), TS has TCC \u2248 209 secs. This may not seem much but when used for 10,000\u2019s of buildings in a utility, it can be punitive. At large scales, CBM (Figs. 7b-7e) may offer a better trade-off and suggest RT for DPT and OFF."}, {"heading": "9.3 Demand Response", "text": "DR uses 15-min predictions to detect peak usage and preemptively correct them to prevent grid instability.\nHence, over-predictions are favored than under to avoid missing peaks, and we set \u03b1 = 0.5 and \u03b2 = 1.5 for DBPE. The campus is a large customer with tighter requirements of error threshold at et = 5% for REL, while individual buildings with lower impact are allowed a wider error margin of et = 10%. Prediction duration is 4 weeks for cost parameters, with the models used thrice a weekday \u2013 before, at the start and during the 1-5PM period, and RT trained weekly.\nDBPE is uniformly smaller than MAPE for the campus and buildings (Figs. 7a-7e), sometimes even halving the errors. Thus the 4 hour DR periods in the weekdays are more (over-)predictable than allday predictions. TS (2hr) has significantly better DBPE than other models, with even TS (6hr) out-performing RT and ToW. For campus, RT is better than DoW, in part due to using temperature features that have a cumulative impact on energy use during midday.\nWe see TS (2hr) gives a high REL of 91% for campus (Fig. 8a) and is the only model with positive REL for RES. Also, TS (6hr) and RT prove to be more reliable for DR in campus and DPT than their poorer showing in the RIM and VAB independent measures (Fig. 4), making them competitive candidates. However, RT\nsuffers in reliable predictions for other buildings, with lower or negative REL (Figs. 8c-8e) while TS (2hr) and (6hr) continue to perform reliably.\nCost-wise, we see RT and TS models are comparable on TCC (Table 4). For once, RT takes longer than TS due to the more aggressive retraining (every week), preferred for critical DR operations. But when seen through the CBM measure, all TS models beat RT for all cases but one (TS (24hr) on DPT). Thus, the TS (2hr) and TS (6hr) are the best for DR on all measures."}, {"heading": "10 CONCLUSION", "text": "The key consideration in evaluating a prediction model by an end-user is its performance for the task at hand. Traditionally, accuracy measures have been used as the sole measure of prediction quality. In this article, we examine the value of holistic performance measures along the dimensions of scale independence, reliability and cost. In evaluating them for consumption prediction in Smart Grids, we see that scale independence ensures that performance can be compared across models and applications and for different customers; reliability evaluates a model\u2019s consistency of performance with respect to baseline models; while cost is a key consideration when deploying models at large scale for real world applications. We use existing scale-independent measures, CVRMSE and MAPE, while extending and proposing four additional measures, RIM and VAB for measuring reliability; and CD and CC for data and compute costs.\nFurther, our novel application-dependent measures can be customized by domain experts for meaningful model evaluation for applications of interest. These measures include DBPE for scale independence, REL for reliability, and TCC and CBM for cost. The value of these measures for scenario-specific model selection were empirically demonstrated using three Smart Grid applications that anchored our analysis even\nas they are generalizable to other domains. Through cross correlation analysis, we found that only MAPE and CVRMSE show absolute correlation > 0.9, indicating that all measures are individually useful.
