It is the first (home) language for over 10 million people in South Africa. Only a few computational resources exist for isiZulu and its related Nguni languages, yet the imperative for tool development exists. We focus on natural language generation, and the grammar options and preferences in particular, which will inform verbalization of knowledge representation languages and could contribute to machine translation. The verbalization pattern specification shows that the grammar rules are elaborate and there are several options of which one may have preference. We devised verbalization patterns for subsumption, basic disjointness, existential and universal quantification, and conjunction. This was evaluated in a survey among linguists and non-linguists. Some differences between linguists and non-linguists can be observed, with the former much more in agreement, and preferences depend on the overall structure of the sentence, such as singular for subsumption and plural in other cases. The more complex meanings of these meanings will be discussed.\n\n\nIn order to distinguish between the three meanings, we will examine the semantic and language properties of a given language. As a consequence, we will examine the semantic and language properties of a given language. The basic grammar specification shows that the lexical properties of a given language are derived from a subset of the same grammar (Bacchiara, Rauchi, Rauchi), including the following, each lexical property, which is used as the language of the word of a given language, as a whole.\nWe consider the concept of the Grammatikalization of a given language. These words are a special type, a particular grammatical structure, which contains an initial set of nouns (in order to achieve lexical structure), the vocabulary (in order to create one language), and the general vocabulary. The lexical properties of a given language are determined by the lexical properties of a given language. This is why there are many different grammatical structures in each language. In this case, there are several syntactic structures that are also important in terms of the grammatical properties of a given language.\nWe will evaluate each grammatical structure.\nThe Grammatikalization of a given language.

Although the imperative in HLT exist, there has been a lack of coordination in the development of HLT in African languages and a total lack of commitment from government and related institutions to invest and advance HLTs. However, the need for them is voiced; e.g., the \u201cNational Recordal System\u201d project by the National Indigenous Knowledge Systems Office (NIKSO) of the South African Department of Science and Technology, and the University of KwaZulu-Natal, which recently made a ground-breaking introduction of mandatory isiZulu module for all its students, and is driving the development of scientific terminology in isiZulu. Visible advances are those that have been made by large companies such as Google and Microsoft, which have seen the localization of the user interfaces of their software, and an error-full Google Translate English-isiZulu. These and related endeavours require natural language generation and machine translation, ar X iv :1\n40 6.\n18 70\nv1 [\ncs .C\nL ]\n7 J\nun 2\n01 4\nand multilingualism in knowledge representation (e.g., [7,1]) with end-user and domain expert interfaces, which do not exist.\nMultilingual systems are being developed elsewhere (among many, [2,10,6]), and there are larger projects, such as Monnet (http://www.monnet-project.eu) for foundational aspects and Organic.Lingua (http://www.organic-lingua.eu) as applied project. As it appeared during our investigation, these advances are not immediately applicable with Nguni languages. Starting from the base and defining a grammar alike described in [12], is a rather daunting task, because the still important reference for linguistic work for isiZulu and Southern Bantu languages are old and outdated [4,5] and it will take many years to update. In the meantime, it is prudent to commence with the basics of NLG in such a way to serve linguists, computer scientists, and domain experts to show relevance. To this end, we take common language constructs of a practical logic language, such as the OWL 2 EL profile [14] that is also used for the SNOMED CT medical terminology, as a starting point to focus on CNL and verbalizations of logical theories. Concerning verbalizations for OWL ontologies, it is already known that there are variations for verbalizations within English [15] and good EnglishOWL systems exist, notably ACE [8] and SWAT [16]. The main results for logic-based conceptual models have been obtained also for monolingual English verbalizations [3], whereas limitations of the so-called template-based approach have been investigated for the multilingual setting [9].\nOverall, this raises several questions: 1) what are the verbalization patterns for isiZulu for the basic constructs? 2) what does that entail for an implementation of a verbalization? 3) are there theoretical options one can choose from, like in other languages, and which ones are preferred among isiZulu speakers? We devised the high-level patterns for verbalization of subsumption, disjointness, existential and universal quantification, and conjunction. The grammar rules for isiZulu are complex to the extent that a template-based approach is not feasible for either of the constructs investigated. This is due to, mainly, the semantics of the noun that affects several other components in a sentence, and the highly agglutinative nature of isiZulu. This also means existing multilingual and verbalization models and infrastructures cannot be transposed and translated to the Nguni languages. There are verbalization options, and we have conducted a survey to elicit both linguist and non-linguist preferences to inform algorithm development for a NLG-focussed grammar engine.\nThe remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes some basic aspects of isiZulu and Section 3 summarizes the results of the verbalization patterns. The user evaluation is presented in Section 4. We discuss in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6."}, {"heading": "2 Some very basic aspects of isiZulu", "text": "IsiZulu is the most populous language in South Africa spoken as a first (home) language by about 23% of the over 50 million population. It has been documented for over a hundred and seventy years with the first booklet Incwadi Yokuqala\nYabafundayo having been produced in 1837. It is a Bantu language that belongs to the Nguni sub-group of languages comprising of isiXhosa, isiNdebele, siSwati and isiZulu. Bantu languages have characteristically agglutinating morphology, which makes them rich and complex in their structure and one of the salient features of isiZulu is the system of noun classes. Each noun in isiZulu belongs to a noun class. It is the noun class that controls the concordance of all words in a sentence whose structure is typically subject verb object (SVO), although variations are attested to exist. The isiZulu noun class prefixes, based on Meinhoff (1948), are mostly coupled in terms of singular/plural, and the classes are listed in Table 1.\nThe noun comprises of two formatives, the prefix and the stem; its structure is depicted in Fig. 1. Prefixes express number and indicate the class to which a particular noun belongs. A prefix can be characterized as full or incomplete. The full prefix has the augment (pre-prefix) followed by a prefix proper and an incomplete prefix only has the augment respectively illustrated as iaugment miprefix proper fulastem (imifula = rivers) and oaugment gogostem (ogogo = grandmothers). Because of the agglutinating nature of isiZulu, a number of prefixes are phonologically conditioned and yet others are homographs. As stated earlier, the morphology of the head noun in the subject position will then influence the agreement pattern as shown in following the example.\nAmantombazana amadala adlala ibhola elimhlophe ama-ntombazana ama-dala a-dlal-a i-bhola e-li-mhlophe 6.-girls 6.big 6.SUBJ-play 5.-ball REL-5.-white \u2018The big girls are playing with the white ball\u2019\nThe abbreviations by convention refer, respectively, to SUBJ = subject, REL = relative and 6./5. = noun class 6 and 5 respectively. The complex agreement system presents interesting challenges in the development of computational technologies in isiZulu. The understanding of the basic morphological structure of isiZulu is crucial in the formulation of the technologies."}, {"heading": "3 Summary of the relevant grammar rules", "text": "Due to space limitations, we describe the patterns and important features, not the analysis we have conducted and (elaborate) algorithms developed.\nThe essence of possible verbalizations of the quantifiers and the main connectives are shown in Table 2. The enumerations in the isiZulu column indicate that its use depends on the context, which may be the category or noun class it applies to, or other aspects in the axiom before or after the symbol, and the additional \u201c/\u201d within an item refers to the fact that one of them has to be chosen, depending on the noun class or first letter of a term. The main variables that affect verbalization in isiZulu for the cases we investigated are the noun class of the name of the OWL class and category of the OWL class, whether the OWL class is an atomic class or a class expression, the quantifier used in the axiom, and the position of the OWL class in the axiom.\nSubsumption. There are two different ways of carving up the nouns to determine which rules apply (Table 2), but for generating good verbalizations, the main issue is to choose between singular or plural with or without the universal quantification voiced, which are illustrated in (S1). One can construct a similar\n(S2) Giraffes v Animals izindlulamithi yizilwane (\u2018giraffes are animals\u2019; generic) (S3) Cellphone v Phone Umakhalekhukhwini uyifoni (\u2018cellphone is a phone\u2019; determinate)\nThe possible patterns for subsumption can be, with N=noun taken from the name of the OWL class, and NC=noun class: a. N1 <copulative ng/y depending on first letter of N2>N2. b. <plural of N1> <copulative ng/y depending on first letter of plural of\nN2><plural of N2>. c. <All-concord for NCx>onke <plural of N1, being of NCx> <copulative ng/y\ndepending on first letter of N2>N2. If the subsumption is followed by negation, then the copulative is omitted, and also here there are options; e.g.:\n(SN1) Cup v \u00acGlass indebe akuyona ingilazi (\u2018cup not a glass\u2019) zonke izindebe aziyona ingilazi (\u2018all cups not a glass\u2019)\nIt combines the negative subject concord (NEG SC) of the noun class of the first noun (aku-) with the pronomial (PRON) of the noun class of second noun (-yona), where each noun class has its version (see Table 1). Thus, the pattern for negation in subsumption can be: a. <N1 of NCx> <NEG SC of NCx><PRON of NCy> <N2 of NCy>. b. <All-concord for NCx>onke <plural N1, being of NCx> <NEG SC of\nNCx><PRON of NCy> <N2 with NCy>. We leave the more complicated cases where the inclusion axiom can be used, like \u2200R.C v \u2203S.(D u E), for future work, as well as negation in other contexts.\nConjunction. The \u2018and\u2019 as enumeration uses na, which changes into (a + i =) ne or (a + u =) no, depending on the first letter of the noun and is then prefixed to the second noun that drops its first letter (always a vowel), illustrated in (C1). Conjunction as connective of clauses has two options, being kanye or futhi, illustrated in (C2).\n(C1) Butter u Milk Ibhotela nobisi (Ibhotela + na + Ubisi) (C2) . . . \u2203has filling.Cream u \u2203has Icing.Lemon flavour . . . ...kune zigcwalisa ukhilimu kanye nezinye uqweqwe olunambitheka ulamula... ...kune zigcwalisa ukhilimu futhi nezinye uqweqwe olunambitheka ulamula...\nWhile this distinction is a hassle in the algorithm, the pattern is straightforward.\nExistential Quantification. Option I in Table 2 refers to cases like (E0), which are not used in OWL ontologies, but that has axioms of type (E1) instead, which include the object property (verb) and for which there are several verbalization options.\n(E0) Ezulwini kune zingilosi (\u2018in heaven there exist angels\u2019) (E1) Giraffe v \u2203eats.Twig izindlulamithi zindla izihlamvana (\u2018giraffes eat twigs\u2019)\nyonke indlulamithi idla ihlamvana elilodwa (\u2018each giraffe eats at least one twig\u2019)\nzonke izindlulamithi zidla ihlamvana elilodwa (\u2018all giraffes eat at least one twig\u2019)\nyonke indlulamithi idla noma yiliphi ihlamvana (\u2018each giraffe eats some twig\u2019)\nzonke izindlulamithi zidla noma yiliphi ihlamvana (\u2018all giraffes eat some twig\u2019)\nyonke indlulamithi idla ihlamvanathize (\u2018each giraffe eats some twig\u2019)\nThus, we have a choice between \u2018at least\u2019 and \u2018some\u2019, and singular and plural. The quantification (underlined text) is more important than verb conjugation here. For the \u2018at least one\u2019, the relative concord (RC) is determined by the noun class system and is attached to the quantitative concord (QC) and then suffixed with the quantitative suffix -dwa; e.g.:\nnoun NC RC QC QSuffix copulative EP ESuffix ihlamvana (\u2018twig\u2019) class 5 eli- -lo- -dwa isifundo (\u2018module\u2019) class 7 esi- -so- -dwa ushizi (\u2018cheese\u2019) class 3a o- -ye- -dwa ihlamvana (\u2018twig\u2019) class 5 yi- -li- -phi isifundo (\u2018module\u2019) class 7 yi- -si- -phi ushizi (\u2018cheese\u2019) class 3a ngu- -mu- -phi\nThere are lookup tables for that, like for the NEG SC and PRON in Table 1. For the \u2018some\u2019 option, it is constructed as copulative + enumerative prefix (EP) + enumerative suffix -phi, as illustrated above, and the conjunction noma collocates with the enumerative to complete the meaning \u2018some among many\u2019. Also for the EP, there is a fixed concord for each noun class. Note that the -i, respectively -u, are added to the copulative, because the copulative cannot be followed by a consonant that the EP begins with. Finally, the clitic -thize, which has a variant form -thile, is another expression of the complex morphology. The clitic -thize attaches to the noun, which is often the object of the sentence, to express the sense that it is some among many of those objects. In (E1) inhlamvanathize would thus mean any one of the twigs. This is a bit borderline in meaning, but it is the only candidate for being a template for that aspect. Overall, the following three core patterns are obtained:\na. <All-concord for NCx>onke <pl. N1, is in NCx> <conjugated verb> <N2 of NCy> <RC for NCy><QC for NCy>dwa; b. <All-concord for NCx>onke <pl. N1, is in NCx> <conjugated verb> noma <copulative ng/y adjusted to first letter of N2><EP of NCy>phi <N2>. c. <All-concord for NCx>onke <N1 in NCx> <conjugated verb> <N2>thize; Verb conjugation is a separate matter, which is complicated to encode, but there are no options to choose from in a verbalization. This is also the case for the prepositions in an OWL object property name (like the \u2018by\u2019 in \u2018taught by\u2019)."}, {"heading": "4 Experimental evaluation of the verbalisation patterns", "text": "The aim of the experiment is to show how the understanding of the basic structure of isiZulu can illuminate the verbalization in isiZulu. While there are various options to verbalize something in isiZulu and these options involve elaborate algorithms, the experiment sought to find out possible preferences for the verbalization of the subsumption, disjointness, and quantifiers in isiZulu from the participants. The experiment also sought to find out if variations in verbalizations mattered to different participants, in particular between linguists and non-linguists."}, {"heading": "4.1 Survey design", "text": "The set up of the experiment was as follows.\n1) Devise a set of sentences that tests the patterns introduced in Section 3, include a few cross-checks, add an \u2018either\u2019 and \u2018neither\u2019 option, and add auxiliary question, being whether the participant is a linguist or not, optional comments and optional contact email. The sentences will be generated through manual application of the patterns. For instance, Question 1 asks the participant to choose between: a) Ikhambi ngumuthi; subsumption singular b) Amakhambi yimithi; subsumption plural c) Wonke amakhambi ngumuthi; with \u2018for all\u2019 quantifier, and plural d) Yomithathu; either one of them e) Awukho; neither\nQuestion 2 asks the same thing as in Question 1, but then with the giraffes. Question 3 offers the option for disjointness singular versus plural and the universal quantification verbalised. Question 4: also asks about disjointness: a) Ihebhivo alilona ikhanivo; singular (disjointness of herbivore and carni-\nvore) b) Amahebhivo awalona ikhanivo; plural c) Yomibili; either one of the two d) Awukho; neither Questions 5 to 9 deal with existential quantification: -dwa versus noma ...- phi (Question 5); Question 6 fixes noma ...-phi but varies by singular vs plural; Question 7 does the same but then with -dwa: a) Sonke isifundo sifundiswa nguSolwazi oyedwa; singular (each course is\ntaught by at least one professor) b) Zonke izifundo zifundiswa nguSolwazi oyedwa; plural c) for \u201ceither\u201d and d) \u201cneither\u201d\nQuestion 8 pits them against each other with singular -dwa vs singular noma ...-phi vs plural noma ...-phi, and Question 9 requires a choice on plural noma ...-phi versus -thize. Question 10 asks about kanye vs futhi. The complete list of sentences is included in the supplementary file, and the survey is left open for people to consider, accessible at http://limesurvey.cs.ukzn.ac.\nza/index.php?sid=25965&lang=zu (click the button labelled \u2018okulandelayo\u2019 to proceed to the main set of questions). 2) Set up the survey in the locally installed Limesurvey (http://www.limesurvey. org). This was chosen because we had localised the relevant part of it to isiZulu in a previous research activity and no other survey software has a localization to isiZulu. Thus, all questions, answer options, autotext, and error messages are in isiZulu. 3) Invite people via email to participate. 4) Collect data after 2.5 days, and analyse it using MS Excel."}, {"heading": "4.2 Results and discussion", "text": "Twenty five people were invited to participate in the survey, among them students, academics (linguists), and non-linguists, such as administrators. In the short time frame, this resulted in 12 completed responses, 5 of whom selfidentified as linguist and 7 as non-linguist. The results are depicted in Table 3 and the (anonymised) excel file is accessible at http://www.meteck.org/files/ CNLsurvey.xls, which also has a copy of the questions and the full answer options; here, question \u201c1. isa\u201d is Question 1 as described above in the materials and methods, and \u201csing.\u201d corresponds to the first option Ikhambi ngumuthi, \u201cpl.\u201d to Amakhambi yimithi and so on, and likewise for Question 4\u2019s \u201csing.\u201d being the Ihebhivo alilona ikhanivo option listed above as answer option a).\nThe survey results show clear preferences from linguists. Question 1 option 1 is an overwhelming choice and this is predictable because of its simple structure. Once the nominal head takes the plural form there seems to be hesitation because of the complex agreement system; e.g., the answers given to Question 2 illustrates this. In the context of negation (Questions 3 and 4), the answers were mixed overall, though there was a slight preference among non-linguists for simple singular over simple plural (not present with the nominal head, Question 3). This agreement system was unavoidable for the \u2018forall-exists\u2019 pattern, and there the plural is preferred over singular (Questions 7 and 8). The -phi and -thize (Question 9) seem not to have any preferences, while -dwa has overwhelming preference over -phi (Question 5).\nIt is an attested fact that there are dialects of isiZulu and some of the salient differences in preferences may be based on dialect variation, which also may explain the dislike for either kanye or futhi (Question 10). It is important that the survey remains open to more participants and maybe a clearer pattern of preferences may emerge. A further option could be to ask them whether the generated sentence is understandable (rather than preference), which may become more relevant when larger axioms are going to be verbalised."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "For languages with isolating morphology such as English, verbalization templates are known to be a good way to explore with developing a controlled natural\nlanguage, or may even suffice for a use case scenario, whereas this approach breaks down for languages with richer (agglutinating) morphology [9]. So far, we have not found a single case where a plain template without supporting encodings of the grammar suffices.The survey revealed some general preferences, such as the -dwa option cf -phi, and dislikes (futhi/kanye), and a few notable differences in preference between linguists and non-linguists, such as the clear preference for the singular for subsumption and the unanimous preference for -dwa among the linguists, and overall the linguists agreed more on their preference compared to the non-linguists. The latter may have to do also with dialect and which region the isiZulu speaker is from.\nThese results can already feed into the development of a verbalization tool, but it requires more research before committing to invest in something like the Grammatical Framework (http://www.grammaticalframework.org/). This paper\nhighlights motivational use cases for further investigation that benefits both isiZulu linguistics and ICT and we will continue to extend the algorithms, add more, and implement them so that domain experts can contribute and easily access, among others, the indigenous knowledge management knowledge base and scientific terminologies in isiZulu.\nAs an added benefit, these results may also inform translation algorithms and tools. Take, e.g., Google Translate English-isiZulu machine translation online and enter \u2018all giraffes eat some twig\u2019 is translated as yonke izindlulamithi udle igatsha (translation obtained 27-3-2014): izindlulamithi is in noun class 10, so it should be zonke instead of yonke, and it misses the quantifier. This can be correctly verbalised with the pattern described in Section 3. As an aside, and looking toward additional verbalization patterns: its udle (2nd or 3rd person singular, imperative) is also incorrect, because the verb has to be conjugated for the noun class of the first noun, which is 3rd person plural non-human (in casu, zidla). Another aspect to investigate in detail is the living/non-living thing distinction, which we avoided for subsumption by using a syntax-based short-cut. This may, or may not, work for other verbalization patterns.\nLast, there are other issues to consider for verbalizing in isiZulu, such as multilingual ontologies and, possibly modifying the Lemon model [13] to cater for annotation with, at least, the noun class, and finding ways for semi-automated ontology translations to/from isiZulu."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "Verbalizing formally represented knowledge in isiZulu requires a grammar engine even for the relatively basic language constructs, which are due to, mainly, the noun classes, the agglutinative nature of isiZulu, and contextual knowledge about the position of the symbol in the axiom. The salient features peculiar to isiZulu that pose a challenge are: i) the system of noun classes, ii) the system of complex agreement, iii) phonological conditioned copulatives, and iv) verb conjugation. We developed a set of possible verbalization patterns for simple subsumption, disjoint classes, quantification, and conjunction. The survey on verbalization pattern preference revealed a clear preference for the -dwa option, and more variation in preference by the non-linguists.\nAlgorithms have been developed for the verbalizations [11], which will be extended further for other larger axioms and verb conjugation, and implemented. It will also be useful to investigate comprehension of the generated sentences and the effect of dialect on preferences.\nAcknowledgements. We thank N. Hadebe, Y. Motloung, M. Ndaba, and S.

It is the first (home) language for over 10 million people in South Africa. Only a few computational resources exist for isiZulu and its related Nguni languages, yet the imperative for tool development exists. We focus on natural language generation, and the grammar options and preferences in particular, which will inform verbalization of knowledge representation languages and could contribute to machine translation. The verbalization pattern specification shows that the grammar rules are elaborate and there are several options of which one may have preference. We devised verbalization patterns for subsumption, basic disjointness, existential and universal quantification, and conjunction. This was evaluated in a survey among linguists and non-linguists. Some differences between linguists and non-linguists can be observed, with the former much more in agreement, and preferences depend on the overall structure of the sentence, such as singular for subsumption and plural in other cases.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
