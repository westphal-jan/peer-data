For example, the population or sample size might not be exactly determinate because of some individuals that partially belong to the population or sample, and partially they do not belong, or individuals whose appurtenance is completely unknown. Also, there are population or sample individuals whose data could be indeterminate. In this book, we develop the 1995 notion of neutrosophic statistics. We present various practical examples. It is possible to define the neutrosophic statistics in many ways, because there are various types of indeterminacies, depending on the problem to solve. As we already did in the 1990s, the basic problem of neutrosophic statistics is that this is not all-or-nothing. It is very difficult to determine what is true. Most modern definitions use the term \"neutrosophic statistics\" because the term \"neutrosophic statistics\" refers to only three categories of statistical data: the data and the data that has the smallest uncertainty. This also means that all of these categories are incomplete, and there are some of them where it is impossible for any given category to be true.\n\nThe basic problem for the neutrosophic statistics is that this is not all-or-nothing. It is simple: the total number of neutrosophic values and the number of neutrosophic values that are not exactly indeterminate. But as we did in the 1990s, and in the past several years, there are very few clear examples of this issue. For example, the most recently published fact of the year in the UK (and elsewhere) was the number of neutrosophic values, which was estimated in 1993 by the American Society of Statisticalians. (For the first time, the exact number of neutrosophic values and the number of neutrosophic values that were counted as non-negative is no longer the same as this.) The number of neutrosophic values, however, remains very much un-negotiable.\nBut that doesn't mean the basic problem of neutrosophic statistics is simply that there are no real answers to this question. It is possible to construct a very specific set of mathematical assumptions which only allow for a narrow definition. It is not necessary to prove, for example, that the neutrosophic value in the figure above is a non-negative", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 8 Jun 2014 16:44:49 GMT  (1610kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2000v1", "122 pages, many geometrical figures, many tables"]], "COMMENTS": "122 pages, many geometrical figures, many tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["florentin smarandache"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.2000"}, "pdf": {"name": "1406.2000.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Florentin Smarandache"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Florentin Smarandache\nINTRODUCTION TO NEUTROSOPHIC STATISTICS\n2014\nContents\nIntroduction ........................................................................................ 5\nNeutrosophic Statistics .................................................................... 8\nNeutrosophic Quartiles ................................................................. 25\nNeutrosophic Sample ..................................................................... 27\nNeutrosophic Numerical Measures ............................................ 31\nClassical Neutrosophic Numbers ................................................ 34\nNeutrosophic Random Numbers ................................................ 56\nExample with Neutrosophic Data ............................................... 57\nIndeterminacy related to the sample size .................................. 59\nNeutrosophic Binomial Distribution ........................................... 63\nNeutrosophic Multinomial Distribution ..................................... 71\nNeutrosophic Scatter Plot ............................................................. 73\nNeutrosophic Regression .............................................................. 77\nNeutrosophic Least-Squares Lines .............................................. 79\nNeutrosophic Coefficient of Determination ............................. 87"}, {"heading": "A Neutrosophic Normal Distribution ........................................ 91", "text": ""}, {"heading": "A Neutrosophic Hypothesis ......................................................... 96", "text": "The Neutrosophic Level of Significance .................................. 105\nThe Neutrosophic Confidence Interval .................................. 109"}, {"heading": "Large-Sample Neutrosophic Confidence Interval for the", "text": "Population Proportion ................................................................. 113\nThe Neutrosophic Central Limit Theorem ............................ 117\nReferences ...................................................................................... 123\nIntroduction\nAlthough the neutrosophic statistics has been defined since 1996, and published in the 1998 book Neutrosophy. / Neutrosophic Probability, Set, and Logic, it has not been developed since now. A similar fate had the neutrosophic probability that, except a few sporadic articles published in the meantime, it was barely developed in the 2013 book \u201cIntroduction to Neutrosophic Measure, Neutrosophic Integral, and Neutrosophic Probability\u201d.\nNeutrosophic Statistics is an extension of the classical statistics,and one deals with set values instead of crisp values.\nIn most of the classical statistics equations and formulas, one simply replaces several numbers by sets. And consequently, instead of operations with numbers, one uses operations with sets. One normally replaces the parameters that are indeterminate (imprecise, unsure, and even completely unknown). That\u2019s why we made the convention that any number a that is replaced by a set be noted aN, meaning neutrosophic a, or imprecise, indeterminate a. aN can be a neighbour of a, can be an interval that includes a, and in general it can be any set that approximates a. In the worst scenario, aN can be unknown. In the best scenario\n(when there is not indeterminacy related to a), aN = a.\nWhy this passage from crisp numbers to sets? Because in our real life we cannot always compute or provide exact values to the statistics characteristics, but we need to approximate them. This is one way to passing from classical to neutrosophic statistics, but other ways could be possible, depending on the types of indeterminacies, and the reader is kindly invited to do such research to be published in the next issues of the international journal of \u201cNeutrosophic Sets and Systems\u201d, http://fs.gallup.unm.edu/NSS/.\nThe author would like to thank Prof. Yoshio Hada, the President of Okayama University of Science, Prof. Valery Kroumov from Okayama University of Science, Prof. Akira Inoue from the State University of Okayama, also Prof. Masahiro Inuiguchi, Dr.Masayo Tsurumi, and Dr. Yoshifumi Kusuroku from the University of Osaka, and Dr. Tomoe Entani from the Hyogo University for their valuable considerations and opinion during my postdoctoral research in Japan in December 2013 and January 2014 about applications of the neutrosophic science in robotics and other fields.\nAny quantity computed with some indeterminacy from values in a sample (i.e. not exactly) is a neutrosophic statistics.\nA neutrosophic statistic is a random variable and as such has a neutrosophic probability distribution.\nThe long-run behaviour of a neutrosophic statistic\u2019s values is described when one computes this statistic for many different samples, each of the same size.\nNeutrosophic Statistics is an extension of the classical statistics. While in classical statistics the data is known, formed by crisp numbers, in neutrosophic statistics the data has some indeterminacy.\nIn the neutrosophic statistics, the data may be ambiguous, vague, imprecise, incomplete, even unknown. Instead of crisp numbers used in classical statistics, one uses sets (that respectively approximate these crisp numbers) in neutrosophic statistics.\nAlso, in neutrosophic statistics the sample size may not be exactly known (for example the sample size could be between 90 and 100; this may happen because, for example, the statistician is not sure about 10 sample individuals if they belong or not to the population of interest; or because the 10 sample individuals only partially belong to the population of interest, while partially they don\u2019t belong).\nIn this example, the neutrosophic sample size is taken as an interval n = [90, 100], instead of a crisp number n = 90 (or n = 100) as in classical statistics.\nAnother approach would be to only partially consider the data provided by the 10 sample individuals whose membership to the population of interest is only partial.\nNeutrosophic Statistics\nNeutrosophic Statistics refers to a set of data, such that the data or a part of it are indeterminate in some degree, and to methods used to analyze the data.\nIn Classical Statistics all data are determined; this is the distinction between neutrosophic statistics and classical statistics.\nIn many cases, when indeterminacy is zero, neutrosophic statistics coincides with classical statistics.\nWe can use the neutrosophic measure for\nmeasuring the indeterminate data.\nThe neutrosophic statistical methods will enable us to interpret and organize the neutrosophic data (data that may have some indeterminacies) in order to reveal underlying patterns.\nThere are many approaches that can be used in neutrosophic statistics. We present several of them through examples, and afterwards generalizations for classes of examples. Yet, the reader can invent new approaches as well in studying the neutrosophic statistics.\nWe emphasize, as in neutrosophic probability, that indeterminacy is different from randomness. While classical statistics is referring to randomness only, neutrosophic statistics is referring to both randomness and especially indeterminacy."}, {"heading": "Neutrosophic Descriptive Statistics is", "text": "comprised of all techniques to summarize and describe the neutrosophic numerical data\u2019s characteristics.\nSince neutrosophic numerical data contain indeterminacies, the neutrosofic line graphs, and neutrosophic histograms are represented in 3D-\nspaces, instead of 2D-spaces as in classical statistics. The third dimension, in addition of the XOY Cartesian System, is that of indeterminacy (I). From unclear graphical data displays we can extract neutrosophic (unclear) information.\nNeustrosophic Inferential Statistics consists of methods that permit the generalization from a neutrosophic sampling to a population from which it was selected the sample.\nNeutrosophic Data is the data that contains\nsome indeterminacy.\nSimilarly to the classical statistics it can be\nclassified as:\n- discrete neutrosophic data, if the values are isolated points;for example: 6 + \ud835\udc561 , where \ud835\udc561 \u2208 [0, 1], 7, 26 + \ud835\udc562, where \ud835\udc562 \u2208 [3, 5];\n- and continuous neutrosophic data, if the values form one or more intervals, for example: [0, 0.8] or [0.1, 1.0] (i.e. not sure which one).\nAnother classification: - quantitative (numerical) neutrosophic data; for example: a number in the interval [2, 5] (we do not know exactly), 47, 52, 67 or 69 (we do not know exactly);\n- and qualitative (categorical) neutrosophic data; for example: blue or red (we don\u2019t know exactly), white, black or green or yellow (not knowing exactly).\nAlso, we may have:\n- univariate neutrosophic data, i.e. neutrosophic data that consists of observations on a neutrosophic single attribute;\n- and multivariable neutrosophic data, i.e. neutrosophic data that consists of observations on two or more attributes.\nAs a particular cases we mention the bivariate neutrosophic data, and trivariate neutrosophic data.\nA Neutrosopical Statistical Number N has the\nform:\n\ud835\udc41 = \ud835\udc51 + \ud835\udc56,\nwhere d is the determinate (sure) part of N, and i is the indeterminate (unsure) part of N.\nFor example, \ud835\udc4e = 5 + \ud835\udc56, where\n\ud835\udc56 \u2208 [0, 0.4], is equivalent to\ud835\udc4e \u2208 [5, 5.4], so for sure \ud835\udc4e \u2265 5 (meaning that the determinate part of a is 5), while the indeterminate part \ud835\udc56 \u2208 [0, 0.4] means the possibility for number \u201ea\u201d to be a little bigger than 5.\nWe may consider, similarly to the classical statistics, a neutrosophic stem-and-leaf display of data.\nFor example, let\u2019s have the neutrosophic data\nthat follows:\n6 + \ud835\udc561, with\ud835\udc561 \u2208 (0, 0.2);\n7 + \ud835\udc562with\ud835\udc562 \u2208 [2, 3];\n6 + \ud835\udc563, with\ud835\udc563 \u2208 [0, 1];\n9 + \ud835\udc564, \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc564 \u2208 [1.1, 1.5);\n9 + \ud835\udc561.\nIts neutrosophic stem-and-leaf display is:\n6 7 9 \u2016 \ud835\udc561 \ud835\udc563 \ud835\udc562 \ud835\udc561 \ud835\udc564\nor under the form of interval:\n6 7 9 \u2016 (0, 0.2) [0, 1] [2, 3] (0, 0.2) [1.1, 1.5]\nObviously a neutrosophic statistic number can\nbe written in many ways.\nIf you retake: \ud835\udc4e = 5 + \ud835\udc56,with\ud835\udc56 \u2208 [0, 0.4], then\n\ud835\udc4e = 4 + \ud835\udc561, with \ud835\udc56 \u2208 [1, 1.4], or\ud835\udc4e = 3 + \ud835\udc562, with \ud835\udc562 \u2208 [2, 2.4], and in general \ud835\udc4e = \u221d + \ud835\udc56\u221d, with \ud835\udc56\u221d \u2208 [5\u2212\u221d, 5.4\u2212\u221d], and \u221d any real number.\nOr in opposite way:\n\ud835\udc4e = 5.4 \u2212 \ud835\udc563, with \ud835\udc563 \u2208 [0, 0.4],\nand in general\n\ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udefd \u2212 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udefd , with \ud835\udc56\ud835\udefd \u2208 [\ud835\udefd \u2212 5.4, \ud835\udefd \u2212 5], and\ud835\udefd any real\nnumber."}, {"heading": "A Neutrosophic Frequency Distribution is a", "text": "table displaying the categories, frequencies, and relative frequencies with some indeterminacies.

For example, the number of families with income in between $10,000 \u2013 $29,000 is between 7 and 9 millions of families. Similarly for other classes of income, except for the last class of income in between $110,000 \u2013 $129,000 that corresponds to a crisp number: 1 million of families.\nWe represented all types of neutrosophic statistical graphs in a space of dimension two (2D) as in classical statistics, but it is also possible to make the graphs in a space o dimension three (3D), just adding to each of the previous 2D-graphs an indeterminate dimension, which measures the indeterminacy of the data.\n1.b.

While the classical samples provide accurate information, the neutrosophic samples provide vague or incomplete information.\nBy language abuse one can say that any sample is a neutrosophic sample, since one may consider their determinacy equals to zero.\nNeutrosophic Survey Results are survey results\nthat contain some indeterminacy.\nA Neutrosophic Population is a population not well determined at the level of membership (i.e. not sure if some individuals belong or do not belong to the population).\nFor example, as in the neutrosophic set, a generic element x belongs to the neutrosophic population M in the following way, \ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc53) \u2208 \ud835\udc40 , which means: x is t % in the population M, f %x is not in the population M, while i % the appurtenance of x to M is indeterminate (unknown, unclear, neutral: neither in the population nor outside).\nExample. Let\u2019s consider the population of a country C1. Most people in this country have only\nthe citizenship of the country, therefore they belong 100% to C1. But there are people that have double citizenships, of countries C1 and C2. Those people belong 50% to C1, and 50% to C2. While citizens with triple citizenships of countries C1, C2, and C3 belong only 33.33% to each country. Of course, considering various criteria these percentages may differ. Also, there are countries with autonomous zones, whose citizens in these zones may not entirely consider themselves as belonging to those countries.\nBut there is another category of people that have been stripped from their C1 citizenship for political reasons and they have other citizenship, while still living (temporarily) in C1.They are called paria, and they do not belong to C1 (not having citizenship), but still belong to C1 (because they still living in C1). They form the indeterminate part of neutrosophic population of country C1.\nA simple random neutrosophic sample of size n from a classical or neutrosophic population is a sample of n individuals such that at least one of them has some indeterminacy.\nExample. One considers a random sample of 1,000 homes, in a city of over one million inhabitants, in order to investigate how many houses have at least a laptop. One finds out that 600 houses have at least one laptop, 300 houses don\u2019t have any laptop, while 100 houses have each of them a single laptop, but not working.\nSome of these 100 house owners tried to have their laptop fixed, others said their laptops\u2019 hard drives have crashed and it is little chance to fix them. Therefore indeterminacy. We have a simple random neutrosophic sample of size 100.\nSimilarly as in classical statistics, in a stratified random neutrosophic sampling the pollster groups the (classical or neutrosophic) population by a strata according to a classification; afterwards the pollster takes a random sample (of appropriate size according to a criterion) from each group. If there is some indeterminacy, we deal with neutrosophic sampling.\nExample. One considers two strata: men and women in the city of Gallup, New Mexico. But, since women represent 51% of the population and men 49%, one takes a random sample of 51 women and a random sample of 49 men.\nBut later learn that \u201eone\u201d man and two \u201cwomen\u201d are actually transgender. Therefore 3 individuals are indeterminate. Whence one has stratified random neutrosophic sampling.\nIf the (classical or neutrosophic) population is divided into subgroups, such that each subgroup is representative of the population, and then one collects from these subgroups a random sample and there is some indeterminacy, then one has a neutrosophic cluster sampling.\nExample. Suppose 5 professors conduct PhD dissertations in neutrosophic statistics. Each\nprofessor has a number of graduate students, but some students are undecided whether to pursue their dissertations in classical or neutrosophic statistics. The professors represent the clusters. One randomly selects 2 professors to interview their students about research in neutrosophic statistics. But, because some students are undecided (indeterminate) with respect to their research topic, we have a neutrosophic cluster sampling.\nA convenience sample is likely to be inaccurate since the pollster selects a sample of individuals that are readily available, who might answer randomly to the questions in order to finish faster. The less the individuals are interested in the survey results, the more likely inaccurate are the survey results. While a voluntary-response sample is more likely to be biased, since the sample individuals may volunteer in purpose to influence the survey results.\nBesides these two categories of sample individuals there is another one of malicious people that might oppositely answer to the questions in order to produce false results.\nThat\u2019s why data of some sample individuals has to be removed, but often we don\u2019t know which ones. Therefore, we have indeterminacy related to the sample size: how many sample people were from the above three categories, and how to depict their data in order to remove them from the survey results? Again, neutrosophic statistics.\nNeutrosophic Numerical\nMeasures\nExample with Neutrosophic Numbers \ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc3c , where a, b are real numbers, and I is indeterminacy, such that \ud835\udc3c2 = \ud835\udc3c and 0 \u2219 \ud835\udc3c = 0."}, {"heading": "Let\u2019s have the neutrosophic numbers:", "text": "\u22122 \u2212 4\ud835\udc3c, \u22121+ 0 \u2219 \ud835\udc3c, 3 + 5\ud835\udc3c, 6 + 7\ud835\udc3c.

And so on. Instead of a random sequence of crisp numbers, we get a random sequence of intervals.\nExample with\nNeutrosophic Data\nLet\u2019s have the following four observations:\n6, [2, 5], 30, [18, 24].\nThe second and fourth observations are unclear, i.e. [2,5] means a number in this interval, but we don\u2019t know which one; similarly for [18, 24].

Weight Average Style:\nOne assigns a weight to each sample. The sample weight may represent the chance that the respective sample could be the right sample, after discarding the wrong observations.\nIn general, the weights \ud835\udc641, \ud835\udc642, \u2026 , \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5b \u2208 [0, 1] such\nthat\n\ud835\udc641 +\ud835\udc642 +\u22ef+\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5b = 1.\nIn the case when the sample weights are determined from criteria different from each other and therefore the sum of weights is not 1, and the observations are \ud835\udc4e1 + \ud835\udc4e2 +\u22ef+ \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b , the weight average is: \ud835\udc641\ud835\udc4e1 +\ud835\udc642\ud835\udc4e2 +\u22ef+\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc641 +\ud835\udc642 +\u22ef+\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5b .\nIn our example, if \ud835\udc641 = 0.4,\ud835\udc642 = 0.1,\ud835\udc643 = 0.3,\ud835\udc644 =\n0.2,\ud835\udc645 = 0.7, then: \ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc54\u210e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b = 0.4(10.5) + 0.1(10.5) + 0.3(10.0) + 0.2(8.5) + 0.7(8.5) 0.4 + 0.1 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.7 \u2243 9.35294; \ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc54\u210e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b = 0.4(11.5) + 0.1(10.75) + 0.3(10.5) + 0.2(9.75) + 0.7(8.5) 0.4 + 0.1 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.7 \u2243 9.83824 and \ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc54\u210e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b = 0.4(3.5) + 0.1(4.38035) + 0.3(4.5) + 0.2(4.43706) + 0.7(2.5) 0.4 + 0.1 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.7 \u2243 3.42673.\nAccording to the sample weights, it\u2019s a larger chance that the right sample is the fifth one. Therefore, the combined statistical metrics of all samples would be inclined to approach the fifth sample\u2019s statistical metrics.\nThis example can be generalized for n observations, such that k observations among them are wrong, where \ud835\udc5b \u2265 2 and 1 \u2264 \ud835\udc58 \u2264 \ud835\udc5b \u2212 1.\nWith a computer program, one studies each of the \u2201\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b\u2212\ud835\udc58 samples resulted after discarding k wrong observations, where \u2201\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b\u2212\ud835\udc58 means combinations of n elements taken in groups of n-k elements. Each sample has the size n-k. For each sample one calculates its median, mean, deviations, standard deviations, and of course other statistical metrics required by the neutrosophic problem to solve.\nThen we combine \u2201\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b\u2212\ud835\udc58 results using either interval style, the average style, the weighted average style, or other procedures that the reader may design depending on the problem.\nNeutrosophic Binomial\nDistribution\nThe classical Binomial Distribution is extended neutrosophically. That means that there is some indeterminacy related to the probabilistic experiment.\nSuppose each trial can result in an outcome labeled success (S), or its mutually exclusive outcome labeled failure (F), or some indeterminacy (I).\nFor example: tossing a coin on an irregular surface which has cracks, the coin can fall inside a crack on its edge, and thus one gets neither head, nor tale, but indeterminacy.\nWe conduct a fixed number of small experiments (that we call trials). The outcomes of the trials are independent. For each trial, the chance of getting S is the same; similarly for the chance of getting F, or of getting I.\nThe neutrosophic binomial random variable xis then defined as the number of successes when we perform the experiment \ud835\udc5b \u2265 1 times.\nThe neutrosophic probability distribution of x is also called neutrosophic binomial probability distribution.\nFor n trials it is important the way one defines\nthe indeterminacy.\nFirst, it is clear that getting indeterminacy in each trial means indeterminacy for the whole set of n trials. Secondly, getting indeterminacy in no trial means no indeterminacy for the whole set of n trials.\nBut what about getting indeterminacy in some trials, and determinacy (i.e. success or failure) in other trials?\nThis partially indeterminate and partially determinate set of n trials depends on the problem one needs to solve and on the expert\u2019s point of view.\nOne can define an indeterminacy threshold:\n\ud835\udc61\u210e = number of trials whose outcome is indeterminate,\nwhere\ud835\udc61\u210e \u2208 {0, 1, 2, \u2026 , \ud835\udc5b}.\nThe cases with a \ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51 > \ud835\udc61\u210e will belong to the indeterminate part, while for a \ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\u210e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51 \u2264 \ud835\udc61\u210e they will belong to the determinate part.\nLet P(S) = the chance a particular trial results in\na success,\nand P(F) = the chance a particular trial results in a failure, for both S and F different from indeterminacy.\nLet P(I) = the chance a particular trial results in\nan indeterminacy.\nFor \ud835\udc65 \u2208 {0, 1, 2, \u2026 , \ud835\udc5b}, NP (exactly x successes\namong n trials) = (\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc65 , \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc65 , \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc65), with\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc5b!\n\ud835\udc65!

This association is usually formulated as a neutrosophic equation or formula, which enables prediction of future values of the dependent variable.\nThe graph of this association is, instead of a\ncurve in classical statistics, for example:\na neutrosophic curve (we can call it a \u201ethick curve\u201d, or \u201estrip curve\u201d), like:\nsince in neutrosophic theory one deals with indeterminacy and approximations.\nAs in classical statistics, the neutrosophic regression may be linear (if the association between independent, and dependent variables is linear), or non-linear (if the association is non-linear). Among the neutrosophic non-linear regressions of second degree one mentions the parabolic, elliptic, and hyperbolic regressions.\nNeutrosophic Least-\nSquares Lines\nThe Neutrosophic Least-Squares Lines that\napproximates the neutrosophic bivariate data\n(\ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc661), (\ud835\udc652, \ud835\udc662), \u2026 , (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b)\nhas the same formula as in classical statistics\n\ud835\u0302\udc66 = \ud835\udc4e + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc66\nwhere the slope\n\ud835\udc4f = \u2211\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66 \u2212 [(\u2211\ud835\udc65)(\u2211\ud835\udc66)/\ud835\udc5b]\n\u2211\ud835\udc652 \u2212 [(\u2211\ud835\udc65)2/\ud835\udc5b]\nand the y \u2013 intercept\n\ud835\udc4e = \ud835\u0305\udc66 \u2212 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\u0305\udc65\nwith \ud835\u0305\udc65 the neutrosophic average of x, and \ud835\u0305\udc66the neutrosophic average of y. One uses the circumflex accent \u0302 above y in order\nto emphasize that \ud835\u0302\udc66 is a prediction of y.\nThe only distinction from classical least-square line is that in neutrosophic theory we work with sets instead of numbers.\nTherefore, into the data, some x\u2019s or y\u2019s are imprecise, expressed by sets.

P-value is the area under the z curve to the\nright of computed z, for Upper-tailed z test.\nb. P-value is the area under the z-curve to the\nleft of computed z, forLower-tailed z test.\nc. P-value is twice the area captured in the tail corresponding to the computed z, for Two-tailed z test.\nLet\u2019s insert from the classical statistics the Standard Normal Cumulative Probability Table [for positive z-values only, since this is needed in our below example]:\nIn the previous example, \ud835\udc3b0 \u2219 \ud835\udf07 \ud835\udf16[40.0, 41.0] versus \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc4e: \ud835\udf07 > 41.0,\nwe found the neutrosophic \ud835\udc67 = [2.24, 3.20].

It tells us how much confidence we have in procedure used in constructing the neutrosophic confidence interval.\nThe classical formulas for the confidence interval are extended from crisp variables to neutrosophic variables (i.e. variables whose values are sets):\n1. When the neutrosophic value of the population standard deviation \u03c3 is known, the"}, {"heading": "Large-Sample Neutrosophic Confidence Interval", "text": "for the Population Mean \u03bc is:\n\ud835\u0305\udc65 \u00b1 (\ud835\udc67critical value) \u2219 \ud835\udf0e\n\u221a\ud835\udc5b\nwhere \ud835\u0305\udc65 is the large-sample neutrosophic mean,\nand \ud835\udc5b is the neutrosophic size of the large-sample.\nTherefore\ud835\u0305\udc65, \u03c3, and/or \ud835\udc5b may be sets instead of\ncrisp numbers.\n2. When the neutrosophic value of the population standard deviation \u03c3 is unknown (as in most practical applications), and the sample size exceeds 30, one uses the sample standard deviation s instead of \u03c3 for computing the Neutrosophic Confidence Interval for the Population Mean \u03bc:\n\ud835\u0305\udc65 \u00b1 (\ud835\udc67critical value) \u2219 \ud835\udc60\n\u221a\ud835\udc5b .\nFor both formulas, the z critical value 1.645 corresponds to the confidence level of 90%, the z critical value 1.96 corresponds to the confidence level of 95%, and the z critical value 2,58 corresponds to the confidence level of 99%, similarly as in classical statistics.\nThe confidence level of, for example, 90% does not refer to the chance that the population mean \u03bc is captured in an interval, but to the percentage of all possible successful samples (i.e. samples for which \u03bc is included in the confidence interval).\nAn Example. Many individuals partially loose vision because\nof exposure to dust.\nOn a study involving 60 people (a sample), that were constantly exposed to dust to their construction work places, in average they lost 18%-20% of their vision accuracy, with a sample standard deviation of 4%-5%.\nThe study investigator wishes a 90% confidence\ninterval for \u03bc.

If \u03c0 cannot be estimated using prior neutrosophic information, one uses \u03c0 = 0.5 which gives a conservatively large sample value (i.e. a larger n than any other value of \u03c0 would do).\nThe Neutrosophic Central\nLimit Theorem\nThe Neutrosophic Central Limit Theorem, which is an extension of the classical Central Limit Theorem, can be safely applied if \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b{\ud835\udc5b} exceeds 30, where \ud835\udc5b is the neutrosophic sample size (i.e. \ud835\udc5b may be a set).\nThe Neutrosophic Central Limit Theorem states that the neutrosophic sampling distribution of \ud835\u0305\udc65 si approximated by a neutrosophic normal curve when \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b{\ud835\udc5b} is sufficiently large, no matter how is the population distribution.\nOf course, if the population distribution is normal, then \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b{\ud835\udc5b} may be smaller than 30, and the neutrosophic sampling distribution of \ud835\u0305\udc65 is normal too for any neutrosophic sample size \ud835\udc5b. But, if the population distribution is not normal, then \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b{\ud835\udc5b} should be greater than 30, and the neutrosophic sampling distribution of \ud835\u0305\udc65 is only an approximation to the normal curve: the larger is \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b{\ud835\udc5b}, the better approach.\nThe last result has enabled the neutrosophic statisticians in order to infer a population mean, to develop large sample neutrosophic procedures even when one deals with an unknown shape of the population distribution.\nUsing similar notations: \ud835\udc5b = random neutrosophic sample size; \ud835\u0305\udc65 = neutrosophic mean of the sample size; \ud835\udf07 = population mean; \ud835\udf0e = population standard deviation; \ud835\udf07\ud835\u0305\udc65 = neutrosophic mean of the \ud835\u0305\udc65 distribution; and \ud835\udf0e\ud835\u0305\udc65 = neutrosophic standard deviation of the \ud835\u0305\udc65\ndistribution;\none has, as in classical statistics:\n\ud835\udf07\ud835\u0305\udc65 = \ud835\udf07,\nand \ud835\udf0e\ud835\u0305\udc65 = \ud835\udf0e\n\u221a\ud835\udc5b ..\nThe neutrosophic central limit theorem does not apply, as in classical statistics, when \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b{\ud835\udc5b} is small and the shape of the population distribution is unknown.\nLet\u2019s introduce the Small-Sample Neutrosophic t Confidence Interval for the Mean of the Normal Population, which is just a neutrosophication of the classical one-sample t confidence interval for the population mean \u03bc:\n\ud835\u0305\udc65 \u00b1 (\ud835\udc61critical values) \u2219 \ud835\udc60\n\u221a\ud835\udc5b\nwhere similarly: \ud835\u0305\udc65 = neutrosophic sample mean; \ud835\udc60 =neutrosophic sample standard deviation; \ud835\udc5b = neutrosophic sample size;\nand\n\ud835\udc61critical value is based on\n\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b{\ud835\udc5b} \u2212 1 degrees of freedom (\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53).\n\ud835\udc65,\u0305 \ud835\udc60, and\ud835\udc5b may be sets instead of crisp numbers. For small \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b{\ud835\udc5b}, the neutrosophic t confidence interval for the population mean \u03bc is appropriate when the population distribution is normal or approximately normal. Otherwise, another method should be employed.\nThe neutrosophic t distribution is more spread out, of course, than the neutrosophic standard normal (\ud835\udc67) curve, because the use of \ud835\udc60, instead of population deviation \u03c3, produces extra variability.\nThe neutrosophic \ud835\udc61 distributions are distinguished from one another by the degree of freedom, which can be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, or a set of positive integers greater than or equal to 1, for example:\n{\ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc5b + 1,\u2026 , \ud835\udc5b + \ud835\udc5a}.\nThe higher is \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b{\ud835\udc5b}, the closer the neutrosophic \ud835\udc61 distribution is to the neutrosophic \ud835\udc67 curve. For \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b{\ud835\udc5b} > 120 one may use the \ud835\udc67 critical values. The neutrosophic \ud835\udc61curve, for a fixed number of degrees of freedom, is in general bell-shaped and centered at zero in neutrosophic style way.\nAn Example.\nA small random sample of 18 workers, at the Rail Road, was investigated regarding the weights these workers are able to lift in their work place. The neutrosophic sample average found was \ud835\u0305\udc65 between 8 kg and 10 kg, with a standard deviation \ud835\udc60 between 3-4 kg.\nLet\u2019s say a confidence level of 95% is required for\ncapturing the population mean \u03bc.Thus:\n\ud835\u0305\udc65 = [8, 10](an interval)\n\ud835\udc60 = [3,4](an interval)\n\ud835\udc5b = 18,\nhence a small sample size, which requires a neutrosophic \ud835\udc61 critical value based on 18 \u2212 1 = 17 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53.\nFrom the below classical statisticsTable of t Critical Values,we find out that for 95% confidence level and 17 df, the corresponding\n\ud835\udc61critical value = 2.11.\nApply the previous formula:\n\ud835\u0305\udc65 \u00b1 (\ud835\udc61critical value) \u2219 \ud835\udc60\n\u221a\ud835\udc5b = [8, 10] \u00b1 2.11\n[3, 4]\n\u221a18\n= [8, 10] \u00b1 [ 2.11(3) \u221a18 , 2.11(4) \u221a18 ] \u22cd [8, 10] \u00b1 [1.492, 1.989].\nSplit the calculation into two possibilities:\n[8, 10] + [1.492, 1.989] = [8 + 1.492, 10 + 1.989]\n= [9.492, 11.989],\nand\n[8, 10] \u2212 [1.492, 1.989] = [8 \u2212 1.989, 10 \u2212 1.492]\n= [6.011, 8.508].\nNow we combine both results in a conservative way, and we get the neutrosophic t confidence interval for the population average of weight lifting: [6.011, 11.989] kg.\nReferences\n1.
