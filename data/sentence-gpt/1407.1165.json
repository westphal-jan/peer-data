In computer speech recognition visual component of speech is used for support of acoustic speech recognition. Design of an audio-visual speech recognizer is based on human lip-reading expert experiences. Hearing impaired people achieve recognition rate of 60-80% in dependence on lip-reading conditions. Most important conditions for good lip-reading are quality of visual speech of a speaker (proper articulation) and angle of view.

Lip-reading (visual speech recognition) is used by people without disabilities, too. It helps better understanding in case when the acoustic speech is less intelligible.Task of automatic speech recognition by a computer, when both acoustic and visual component of speech is used has attracted many researcher to contribute in automaticAudio-Visual Speech Recognition domain. This is challenging because of the visual articulations vary with speaker to speaker and can contain very less information as compared to acoustic signal therefore identification of robust features is still center of attraction of many researchers.The visual speech component is used by hearing-impaired people (for lip-reading), but is also used unconsciously by all people in common communication, especially in noisy environment by \u017dELEZN\u00ddet.al,2006.\nJ R Delleret al.,1993, has described in his work on Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for well define applications like dictations and medium vocabulary transaction processing tasks are in relatively controlled environments have been designed. It is observed by the researchers that, the ASR performance was far from human performance in variety of tasks and conditions, indeed ASR to date is very sensitive to variations in\nthe environmental channel (non-stationary noise sources such as speech babbled, reverberation in closed spaces such as car, multi-speaker environments) and style of speech (such as whispered etc). Eric Petjanet al., 1987 and Finn K.I et al., 1986 worked on Lip-reading is an auditory, imagery system as a source of speech and image information. It provides the redundancy with the acoustic speech signal but is less variable than acoustic signals; the acoustic signal depends on lip, teeth, and tongue position to the extent that significant phonetic information was obtainable using lip movement recognition alone. The intimate relation between the audio and imagery sensor domains in human recognition can be demonstrated with McGurk Effect by McGurket al., 1976 and 1978.where the perceiver \u201chears\u201d something other than what was said acoustically due to the influence ofconflicting visual stimulus. The current speech recognition technology may perform adequately in the absence of acoustic noise for moderate size vocabularies; but even in the presence of moderate noise it fails except for very small vocabularies by Paul D.B et al., Malkin F.J, 1986, Meisel W.S, 1987 and Moody T et al., 1987.\nHumans have difficulty distinguishing between some consonants when acoustic signal is degraded. However, to date all automatic speech reading studies have been limited to very small vocabulary tasks and inmost of cases to very small number of speakers. In addition the numbers of diverse algorithms have been suggested in the literature for automatic speech reading and areverydifficult to compare, as they are hardly ever tested on any common audio visual databases. Furthermore, most of such databases are very small duration thus placing doubts about generalization of reported results to large population and tasks. There is no specific answer to this but researchers are concentrating more on speaker independent audio-visual large vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems by ChalapathyNeti, et.al., 2000.\nMany methods have been proposed by researchers in order to enhance speech recognition system by synchronization of visual information with the speech as improvement on automatic Lip-reading system which incorporates dynamic time warping, and vector quantization method applied on alphabets, digits and The recognition was restricted to isolated utterances and was speaker dependent by Eric Petjan et al.,1987. Later ChristophBregler.,1993had worked on how recognition performance in automated speech perception can be significantly improved & introduced an extension to existing Multi- State Time Delayed Neural Network architecture for handling both the modalities that is acoustics and visual sensor input. Similar work have been done by Yuhaset.al.,1993& focused on neural network for vowel recognition and worked on static images. Paul Duchnowskiet.al.,1995 worked on movement invariant automatic Lip-reading and speech recognition, JuergenLuettin., 1996 used active shape model and hidden markov model for visual speech recognition, K.L. Sum et al.,2001 proposed a new optimization procedure for extracting the point-based lip contour usingactive shape model, Capiler 2001 used Active shape model and Kalman filtering in spatiotemporal for noting visual deformations, Ian Matthews et al.,2002 has proposed method for extraction of visual features of Lip-reading for audio-visual speech recognition , Xiaopeng Hong et al.,2006 used PCA based DCT features Extraction\nmethod for Lip-reading, Takeshi Saitohetal., 2008 has analyzed efficient Lip-reading method for various languages where they focused on limited set of words from English, Japanese, Nepalese, Chinese, Mongolian. The words in English and their translated words in above listed languages were considered for the experiment.Meng Li et al.,2008 has proposed A Novel Motion Based Lip Feature Extraction for Lip-reading problems.\nThis paper introduced mechanism of extraction of audio-visual features for visual speech recognition.

'vVISWa\u2019 Dataset", "text": "Many researchers have defined their own dataset and very few are available online freely. Indeed it is very difficult to distribute the data base freely on the web due to the size. The video sequences used for this study was collected in the laboratory in a closed environment. The \u2018vVISWa\u2019 (Visual Vocabulary of Independent Standard Words) database consists set of independent/isolated standard words from Marathi, Hindi and English script. The dataset of isolated city words like {\u2018Aurangabad\u2019, \u2018Beed\u2019, \u2018Hingoli\u2019, \u2018Jalgaon\u2019, \u2018Kolhapur\u2019, \u2018Latur\u2019, \u2018Mumbai\u2019, \u2018Osmanabad\u2019, \u2018Parbhani\u2019, \u2018Pune\u2019, \u2018Satara\u2019, \u2018Solapur\u2019} in Marathi were considered for this experiments. Each visual utterance is recorded for 2 second. The database consists of 10 individuals speakers, 4 male and 6 female and each speaker speaking each word utterance for 10 times. Each individual has uttered word in close-open-close constraint without head movement. The database comprised of 1200 utterance (10*10*12) of these independent standard words. The figure 2.1 shows the experimental arrangement of acquisition of utterances from individual speaker.\nThe visual utterance was recorded at resolution of 720 x 576 in (*.avi) format using high definition digital camera in three angle comprising full frontal using camera \u2018C1\u2019, 45oface using camera \u2018C2\u2019 and side pose using camera \u2018C3\u2019. This study was focused on full frontal profile of utterance. Lighting was controlled and a\ndark gray background was used. The recognition of visual utterance of word, the data set of isolated city words was divided in to 70% known sample and 30% unknown sample. The System was trained over 70% known set and 30% unknown samples were tested on the known set and success recognition of isolated word based on visual utterance was evaluated."}, {"heading": "3. Methodology", "text": "The typical audio visual speech recognition system accepts the audio and visual input as shown in figure 3.1. The audio input is captured with the help of standard audio mic and visual utterance is captured by using standard camera. The place between camera and individual speaker is kept constant in order to get proper visual utterance. Once the input is acquired, it will be preprocessed for acoustic feature extraction and visual feature extraction separately and further used for recognition and integration of utterance.\nVisual features can be grouped into three general categories: shape-based, appearance-based, and combinational approaches. All three types require the localization and tracking of Region of Interest (ROI). Region of interest for computation of visual feature will be concentrated towards the movement of lips (opening and closing of mouth) over the time frame which is very complex. In-view of this calculating good and discriminatory visual feature of mouth plays vital role in the recognition."}, {"heading": "3.1 Region-of-Interest (ROI) Detection / Localization", "text": "The visual information relevant to speech is mostly contained in the motion of visible articulators such as lips, tongue and jaw. In order to extract this information from a sequence of video frames it is advantageous to track the complete motion of the face detectionand mouth localization, this helps in visual feature extraction. In order to achieve robust and real-time face detection we used the \u2018Viola-Jones\u2019 detector based on \u2018AdaBoost\u2019 which is a binary classifier that uses cascades of weak classifiers to boost its performance by G. Bradski and A. Kaehler, 2008 and C. M. Bishop,2006. In our study we used detector to detect the face in each frame from the sequence and subsequently mouth portion of the face is detected. This is achieved by finding the median of the coordinates of the ROI object bounding box of frames. Finally a region-of-interest (ROI)is extracted by resizing the mouth bounding box to120x120 pixels size as shown in figure3.2.\nAfter isolating ROI Mouth frame, each frame from utterance was pre-processed so as to obtain good discriminating features. The preprocessing include, separation of RGB channel and subtract R channel to gray scale image, filter the resultant image then calculating gray threshold range and converted frame into binary frame to get the actual Region-of-Interest (ROI)of containing only the portion covered by lips as shown in figure 3.3 and in similar way the ROI for each frame of utterance is identified as shown Table 1\nTable 1: Isolated Mouth from video sequence"}, {"heading": "3.2 Visual Feature Extraction", "text": "After extracting the region-of-interest (ROI) from frame, the next step is to extract the appropriate features in each frame. We used Zernike movement for features extraction. Zernike moments have mathematical properties which makes them ideal for image feature extraction.

Recognition of uttered word is based on information in speech signal contained at the time of pronunciation of word. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) approach is the most popular because it uses spectral base as parameters for recognition. MFCC\u2019s are the coefficients, which represent audio based on perception of human auditory systems. The reason behind selection of MFCC for recognition purpose due to its peculiar difference between the operations of FFT/DCT. In the MFCC, the frequency bands are positioned logarithmically (on the Mel scale) which approximates the human auditory system's response more closely than the linearly spaced frequency bands of FFT or DCT by Clarence Goh Kok Leonet al., 2009 and B. Gold et al., 2000. Figure 3.4 shows the block diagram of MFCC features extraction process. After acquisition of input our objective is to remove noise contained in speech signal and it will be removed by using first order high pass filter. This process helps in cleaning acoustic-input.Frame blocking phase converts segmented concatenated voiced speech signals in to frames. The discontinuities contained in the segmented signal is checked at the beginning and end of each frame using hamming window and this was performed by windowing step. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)brings the each frame of signal from time domain to frequency domain and the result is said to be \u2018spectrum\u2019.\nIt is well known that, human ear perception of frequency contents of sounds for speech signal does not follow a linear scale. Therefore, for each tone with an actual frequency f, measured in Hz, a subjective pitch is measured on a scale called the \u201cmel\u201d scale.The mel frequency scale is a linear frequency spacing below 1000 Hz and a logarithmic spacing above 1000Hz. To compute the mels for a given frequency \u2018f\u2019 in Hz is calculated as.\nMel(f) = Sk = 2595 \u2217 log10(1 + \ud835\udc53\n700 ) (4)\nFinally, we convert the calculated log mel spectrum back to time. The result is called the Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC). The Cepstral representation of the speech signal spectrum provides a good representation of the local spectral properties of the signal forframe analysis. The mel spectrum coefficients are real numbers so we convert them to the time domain using the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and by this conversion contribution of pitch is removed by Vibha Tiwari.\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5b = \u2211 (log \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58) [\ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udc58 \u2212 1 2 ) \ud835\udf0b \ud835\udc58 ]\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58=1 (5) Where n=1,2,3...k"}, {"heading": "4.

In recent year, there have been many advances in automatic speech reading system with the inclusion of audio and visual speech features to recognize words under noisy conditions. The objective of audio-visual speech recognition system is to improve recognition accuracy. In this paper we computed visual features using Zernike moments and audio feature using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) on \u2018vVISWa\u2019 (Visual Vocabulary of Independent Standard Words) dataset which contains collection of isolated set of city names of 10 speakers. The visual features were normalized and dimension of features set was reduced by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in order to recognize the isolated word utterance on PCA space.The performance of recognition of isolated words based on visual only and audio only features results in 63.88% and 100% respectively.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
