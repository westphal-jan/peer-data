A group of researchers have studied the brain, in which neurons are thought to be involved in language processing, language formation, and learning.\n\n\n\nThe researchers, using data from three decades of systematic research, are able to establish the foundations of the scientific community of the world. The group is a consortium of more than 20 scientists working on this topic. The group is comprised of students, researchers, and scholars from seven international universities, and of the following four European countries. Each is affiliated with the European Research Council, an international research committee composed of over 700 scientists.\nThe group is part of the EU Science and Development Framework (ESA) which is designed to support research on the development and development of new technologies in the field of human cognition. This framework includes the European Regional Science Council (ERR), the European Physical Society (EPS), the European Molecular Association (EPS), and the European Biological Science Council (CBI). The European Regional Science Council (ESA) will develop and develop new technological and technology that helps develop and promote the future of science.\nThe study was co-authored by Thomas Hinton, a graduate student, a PhD student, and a member of the ERC's Global Science Framework.

Since its founding in 1948, the UG Foundation is the world's leading research and development body.\nIn 2010, a new global UG project was launched. This new foundation established in partnership with the World Health Organization. In 2016, the European Research Council will develop the best scientific foundation of the world. The EU Science and Development Framework (EUSCF) is the world's leading international policy framework.\nAbout the UG Society\nThe UG Society is a global scientific community that represents nearly every aspect of human cognition.

This, however, resulted in different and sometimes contradicting theories that do not indicate a universally unique grammar. In this research, we tackle the UG problem from an entirely different perspective. We search for the Unique Universal Grammar (UUG) that facilitates communication and knowledge transfer, the sole purpose of a language. We formulate this UG and show that it is unique, intrinsic, and cosmic, rather than humanistic. Initial analysis on a widespread natural language already showed some positive results.\nKeywords: Alphabet; natural languages; Universal Grammar; pragmatics; semantics; communication."}, {"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Humans have intrinsic need to answer questions and understand the universe. Through the\ncourse of human civilization, philosophers and scientists were able to answer -or at least speculate- about many fundamental questions, e.g., where did life come from? What is the age of the universe? How did it all start? And many others. One question, however, puzzled people for a long time. It is about language. They say language is the main evolutionary contribution of humans to the cosmos, and perhaps the most interesting trait that has emerged in the past 500 million years (Nowak et al. 2002). How did it all start? Was language inherited to us genetically from other species? Do we share language with other species in the first place? And how is language constructed from its basic building blocks? All these questions can be answered once we rigorously define the language."}, {"heading": "Language and Universal Grammar", "text": "A language is a set of sentences; A sentence is a string of symbols; And an alphabet is a finite\nset of symbols. Some languages are finite and some are not. There are infinitely many finite languages, as many as integers. There are also infinitely many infinite languages, as many as real numbers. Hence, the set of all languages is not countable (Nowak et al. 2002).\nA grammar is a finite set of rules specifying a language. Natural languages are infinite.\nHowever, the learning theory and common sense suggest that no algorithm can learn a set of\n1 The authors can be reached at y-kaadan@hotmail.com and asaad.kaadan@ou.edu respectively.\n\u2018super-finite\u2019 languages (Nowak et al. 2002), i.e., containing all finite languages and at least an infinite one. This calls for a need to a restricted set of grammars specifying languages learnable by the human brain. The theory of this restricted set is called \u2018universal grammar\u2019 (UG), which was introduced by Chomsky about fifty years ago (Chomsky 1965). The remaining question is whether UG is innate or not, which is still the subject of debate. Never the less, the classical learning theory developed by Gold (Gold 1967) suggests that a restricted search space has to exist before data, i.e., the linguistic symbols, in the language acquisition process. Therefore, the term \u2018before data\u2019 refers to an intrinsic restricted search space, which is the innate UG. Researchers believe UG is genetically transferred from generation to generation and thus it is affected by biological evolution that results in cultural evolution of languages (Larson 2010; Lightfoot 1998). We believe, however, that UG is fixed and unique. It is not a biological phenomenon and thus does not encounter evolution. It is as fixed and unique as the mathematical logic behind it, as will be shown later. Language, on the other hand, is undoubtedly evolutionary. Genetics and environment have a profound effect on the evolution of languages."}, {"heading": "Historical Perspective", "text": "We have to distinguish language from inscription, which is no more than a linguistic expression form that may or may not succeed in delivering the message. It is notable that inscription did not express the entire capabilities of language especially at its early stages. Even though many civilizations have developed their own writing style, these styles evolved relatively differently.\nOne of the most important early writing styles is graphical representation, where the entire\nobject or some parts of it were visualized graphically, e.g., drawing an entire buffalo or only its head to represent it. Abstract ideas were represented using evocative graphics, e.g., Hieroglyphs used a man with a crutch to represent aging and a man with his hand on his mouth to represent hunger.\nCuneiform writing is an advanced form of graphical representation where human voice is\ndivided into syllables and each syllable was encoded in a graphical symbol. These symbols reached 8000 in Babylonian and Assyrian languages, each of which comprised of vowels followed by consonants. Cuneiform writing has endured a transformative evolution that we came across in 1928 in archeological excavations on the Syrian coast. In a historical site named Ugarit, many cuneiforms dating back to 1500 B.C. have been found (Day 2002; Pardee 2007). These cuneiform inscriptions consist of only 30 symbols, which is considered the first known alphabet. These inscriptions mark the astonishing moment in time where people moved from syllabic to alphabetic languages. Writing continued to evolve with time and more symbols and punctuation marks were added to accurately convey spoken language. All these consonants, vowels and punctuation marks constitute the required alphabet to accurately capture and store a language. These symbols interact with each other to convey unique ideas as accurately and rigorously as numbers interact to convey numerical values.\nSimilar to the fact that math consists of abstract formulas describing various physical\nphenomena; the language, as shown later, consists of abstract expressions describing various physical or mental elements. Words describe different states and elements, just as numbers describe different quantities. In fact, there is a great similarity between alphabets and numerical systems. Let us take the decimal numbering system for example; assuming that we did not\ndiscover the ten decimal symbols (0 to 9) and the meaning of a decimal digit, we would still be struggling with Roman numerals that describe each number with a different symbol. People will need to memorize a huge, in fact infinite, dictionary to understand different numbers. Similarly, we are struggling today with linguistic dictionaries because we do not understand the alphabet and how alphabet letters are combined to create meaningful words and sentences. Discovering what each letter means and the principles behind combining letters into language, i.e., the UG, will enable us to understand any original word or expression unless it was a man-made acronym. Language will become as simple and accurate as numerical systems."}, {"heading": "Universal Grammar is Unique", "text": "We introduced earlier the formal definition of a language in terms of its sub-components. The\nfunctional definition of a language, however, is a method of communication and knowledge dissemination. All living things strive for immortality. Humans, as the most advanced species, have used languages to defy time and transfer information between individuals and across generations.\nKnowledge dissemination is the sole purpose of any communication process between living\nindividuals and language is the carrier of that communication. On the cellular level, impregnation is considered a communication process where knowledge or information, DNA and RNA stored in chromosomes, are exchanged. This biological language only has a four-letter alphabet and is able to generate all complex life forms.\nWe believe, since language is a communication process, basic rules governing\ncommunication are the same as those governing language. These rules are what define the universal grammar (UG). Communication methods in nature range from chemical compounds in insects to air vibrations (sounds) and signals in human beings. The communication process is independent from the communication device or medium, thus the basic communication principles (what we refer to as UG) are unique. The language is independent from the means of conveying it. Based on this, an alphabet is a system that assists human beings, for example, to convey the language by sounds, graphics, signals, etc. Most researchers study languages regardless of the writing style (writing symbols), because writing or inscription is just a mean of conveying the language. Some nations even did not develop inscription symbols for their languages (Lewis 2014), because they did not have to. We will study UG regardless of the sounding symbols or phonetics as well, because sound is also a mean of conveying the language. As a summary, UG is the collection of abstract principles that govern the communication process. UG is independent from any communication device. It can be used with sounds, gestures or inscriptions. Humans, other primates or even single-cell life forms can utilize it. UG is unique. It might be inferred from our discussion that UG is life-related and thus might be biologically defined. This is not the case. In fact, we will show later that UG is mathematically defined and deeply embedded in the cosmos fabric."}, {"heading": "From Communication to Universal Grammar", "text": "Nouns are the most important parts of speech, and usually the naming process is un-\ndescriptive, i.e., we use an arbitrary code or idiom to name a particular object. This is exactly what we do most of the time when we name our children, we use arbitrary names. In addition, when we transfer a word from one language to another, we use arbitrary names too, and the transferred word becomes an idiom. Nevertheless, a language with all idiomatic nouns is exhausting. Man will need to memorize a lengthy dictionary if this language was a little bit rich and comprehensive.\nA better way to communicate is to give every object a descriptive name, i.e., defining that\nobject using a short list of known, already-defined, objects; exactly as we do in numerical systems. Since the main objective of any language is to facilitate easy and accurate communication, the more easy-and-precise this language is, the closer it is to the perfect one. Based on this analysis, we consider all words in an easy-and-precise communication system to be descriptive and non-arbitrary. We will start developing our algorithm from the very basic and intuitive facts. Any rational person intuitively accepts such facts."}, {"heading": "Basic Definitions", "text": "One of the very basic definitions is the element. The element is anything you can touch, feel\nor imagine. Life is full of elements: human being is an element, John is an element, the atom is an element and the house too. Thoughts and emotions are also elements, even though their description is relative. Each element is usually comprised of parts (which are elements too.) This same element can also join other elements to form a new one. Thus, new elements are formulated using a unique process called operation. Operation is the second basic definition, which we call \"The Unique Creation Principle\".\nApplying the principle of unique creation on two elements is called logical conjunction or\nlogical multiplication. It is denoted by the \"\u22c0\" symbol which is read as: conjugated with, or formulated with, or even \"And\". The \"And\" here represents a purely logical operation, which is the creation of a new element using two other elements. It is clear that any operation on different elements will usually form a new one. Thus, we sometimes call it a formulation.\nThe third basic definition is the relation, which we call \"The Identity Principle\" or \"The Unique Existence Principle\". This means the element can only exist in a unique form, i.e., it cannot exist in a form other than its own (Symbolically we write: a = a.) The relation identifies each object from another. It gives objects their \"uniqueness\" after being formulated by the operation. The relation never creates new elements. It only specifies existing ones. An example of this would be the \"greater than\" relation. This relation only defines the rank of two elements compared to each other. It does not yield a new element.\nWe are always in need to define new elements in order to interact with them. Each new\nelement can be defined by figuring out its parts and the relations among them, plus the element's own relations with other elements. The new element's definition should only depend on alreadydefined or intuitively discovered elements. In this sense, an element definition is the sum of all operations that build/formulate this element from its parts, and the sum of all relations between this element and the other elements.\nWe, in order to share a knowledge with each other, e.g., sharing an address; we use a\nlinguistic formulation of multiple operations and relations concerning the elements of this particular subject (or place). In short, we define that subject to others using predefined (or preagreed on) elements. This definition does not need to cover all aspects of the subject, only the minimum description that conveys the idea correctly. Living things are engineered to the highest efficiency in all their activities including communication. The minimum description, however, might be missing some essential facts that cause \"misunderstanding\" between the two parties to occur.\nBased on this discussion, any information sharing/knowledge transfer act is considered a\nformula, which we call in language an expression. This formula or expression requires three components in order to take place: the source of knowledge/formula/expression, which we call first component; the knowledge/formula/expression itself, which we call second component; and the destination of the knowledge/formula/expression, which we call third component. The absence of any of these components will definitely cancel the communication process.\nThis definition implies that communication (and language) is all about the mental state of\nboth the first and third components regarding the second one. If the speaker speaks a language unknown to the listener, then, no communication is actually taking place.\nGenerally speaking; The source of a (formula, expression) can be the speaker in language, the\nhandworker in the shop, the performer on the stage, etc.\nSimilarly, the (formula, expression) itself could be the words (and later the inscriptions) in\nlanguage, the goods in the shop, the play on the stage, etc.\nAnd last but not least, comes the destination of a (formula, expression) which could be the\nlistener in language, the consumer in the shop, and the critic in the audience."}, {"heading": "Universal Grammar is Cosmic", "text": "Obviously, each element occupies a space, whether physical or mental. This comes from the\nfact that an element can be described as available or absent. If the element is absent in some place, then it definitely exists somewhere else. The element cannot vanish and cannot come from nowhere. This is referred to in logic as \"The Law of Excluded Middle\" which means there is no middle (or third) state for an element; it is either existing or not.\nIt is also intuitive that each element has a time slot. This means the element cannot be available and absent at the same time. The two states must come consecutively. First, it is available and then absent or vice versa. This is referred to in logic as \"The Law of No Contradiction\".\nThe (form, attribute) bilateral is another substitute for the (operation, relation) bilateral; they\nboth represent a general abstraction for the (mass, energy) concepts in physics. Mass is the creation of an object from its physical parts (atoms for example), whereas energy between these parts, or between the object and other objects, define its existing relations (atomic and other forces). To summarize, each element -physical or not- is a formulation of multiple operations on its parts plus the relations governing them. Thus, a formula is a definition of an element and the element is a representation of that formula. The element and formula are two faces of the same coin.\nIt is intuitive that each element can be described as existing (available) or non-existing\n(absent). The (existence, absence) states can be denoted by (1, 0) respectively. This leads us to very important concepts: time and space.\nIn fact, we see that formulation (operation) or \"Unique Creation Principle\" is another\nsynonym for the space concept. In addition, the relation (attribute) or \"Unique Identity Principle\" is another form of the time concept. Without the (formulation, relation) or (operation, attribute) there will be no space and no time. This links to the interesting fact in Einstein's general relativity theory that time and space would not exist in case mass (the formulation process) vanished.\nThe three communication components (source, expression and destination) plus the element\nwith its form and attributes constitute the base for our UG. They can completely and uniquely define any knowledge state and thus facilitate accurate communication, the purpose of a language. The UG elements, as shown above, are not restricted to humans, or to their intellectual merit. These elements are embedded in the universe, linked to its space-time fabric. Human beings possess UG intuitively and identify its elements as part of their existence in the universe. Similar to the fact that humans cope with basic logic and mathematics principles intuitively.\nConsequently, language -just like math- is certainly discovered and not invented by humans,\nand the most developed language is the most discovered one. In fact, language would be available out there even if human race would not exist. This is because language, as shown earlier, is the result of mutual interaction between nature elements. Language, therefor, is cosmic and not humanistic. Since many other creatures, especially high primates like Chimpanzees, have shown basic logic inference capabilities, we believe they are also equipped with the same UG. This means we can, in theory, communicate with them given suitable devices and deeper understanding of their alphabet. The only things separating us from other primates in terms of language are the following:\n We use a different \u201ccoding\u201d scheme, i.e., we encode our alphabet with different\nsounds, gestures, etc.\n We have much more processing capabilities and thus we can further extrapolate ideas\nand combine abstract thoughts to reach deeper understanding of our environment and communicate this understanding more accurately. Thus, in this work, we link language development directly with brain size and capabilities.\nIt is worth mentioning that quantum physics breaks many of the classical physical laws. As a\nresult, the above laws of Excluded Middle and No Contradiction do not exist in the world of small particles. Quantum phenomena, however, never appear in our macroscopic world. Understanding the bizarre quantum phenomena is still a work in progress and it is not known if this behavior is actually happening or it is just an illusion created by our measurement devices working at the quantum scale. Since language is used to describe our macroscopic world, quantum physics do not pose any threats for UG."}, {"heading": "Analyzing the Universal Grammar", "text": "Let us study the formula of an element F from a set U. We represent existence (or\navailability) of element F by drawing some boundary inside set U. As seen in Figure 1.\nThus, the element's absence is represented by F complement with respect\nto U. This is the shaded area between the two boundaries. Since F is absent from the shaded area (F complement), then it is definitely available in the non-shaded area (F) according to the \"The Law of Excluded Middle\".\nIt is clear that when we look at the area (or space) associated with element\nF we determine its form, i.e., the elements that formulate F. However, when\nwe look at the space associated with F complement, we determine the form of elements inside F complement, i.e., outside F. Determining the form of the complement\u2019s elements leads to the identification of any element outside the complement, i.e., inside F. The identification of an element does not provide us with its specific form rather with its attributes that help identify it from others. Based on this logic, an element is determined (i.e., its form) using its own space. An element is identified (i.e., its attributes) using its complementary space. Intuitively, F takes a value \u20181\u2019 inside its own space and a value \u20180\u2019 inside its complementary space.\nOne important aspect to mention is that determining an element\u2019s form using its space alone\ndoes not identify it. In order to identify this element we need to use its complement space too. The complement represents a comparison system used in the identification process. For example, we cannot identify \u201cBeauty\u201d if we do not know \u201cUgliness\u201d. Ugliness is the comparison system that gives beauty its meaning. On the other side, identifying an element using its complementary subspace alone does not determine that element for us. If you knew \u201cugliness\u201d alone without determining any form of \u201cbeauty\u201d, then beauty is not known to you.\nThe previous discussion leads us to the following fact: Our knowledge about an element can\nbe completely and accurately classified into four different states: Knowing only the form, knowing only the attributes (relations), knowing both the form and attributes, or knowing none of them. Mathematically, it is the knowledge of F, F complement, both F and its complement, or none of them, respectively.\nWe usually denote elements with small English letters, e.g., a, b, c, etc. Each element\naccording to the Excluded Middle Law must be in either one of the existence/absence states, i.e., 1 or 0, respectively. Let us take the element a. The complementary element is denoted \"~a\" and according to Excluded Middle Law they cannot coexist in the same place, i.e., If (a) is available here then ~a is not. The element (~a) is definitely available in some other place (It cannot vanish.) Note that according to The Law of No Contradiction the element must move to the opposite state if the values were to be changed.\nAs a summary, the following basic definitions are used as a base for our UG:\n The element or formula.\n The operation, form, or the Unique Creation principle.\n The relation, attribute, or the Unique Identity principle.\nOur knowledge about an element, i.e., its form and attributes, is governed by two\nfundamental concepts: the Law of Excluded Middle (the space concept) and The Law of No Contradiction (the time concept)."}, {"heading": "Combining Formulas", "text": "Since formulas (elements) constitute our basic building blocks, we will introduce in this\nsection the formula composition principle, which will be of a great importance in developing our formal UG theory in the following sections.\nLet us take the formulas \ud835\udc531 and \ud835\udc532. We can create a new formula via the composition of these\ntwo formulas. The following examples explain the composition process in detail:\nIf (x \ud835\udc531 y) was (x is y's brother) and (y \ud835\udc532 z) was (y is z's mother), then (x is z's uncle) is (x \ud835\udc53 z), where \ud835\udc53 = \ud835\udc531 \u2218 \ud835\udc532; We read \"\ud835\udc531 composition \ud835\udc532\".\nIf (x is y's mother) was (x \ud835\udc532 y) and (y is z's brother) was (y \ud835\udc531 z), then (x is z's mother) is (x \ud835\udc53 z), where \ud835\udc53 = \ud835\udc532 \u2218 \ud835\udc531; We read \"\ud835\udc532 composition \ud835\udc531\".\nThe previous examples show that in general \ud835\udc531 \u2218 \ud835\udc532 \u2260 \ud835\udc532 \u2218 \ud835\udc531. We can apply the composition\nprinciple to more than two formulas. For example: \ud835\udc53 = \ud835\udc531 \u2218 \ud835\udc532 \u2218 \ud835\udc533. This brings us to the associativity property of composition: (\ud835\udc531 \u2218 \ud835\udc532) \u2218 \ud835\udc533 = \ud835\udc531 \u2218 (\ud835\udc532 \u2218 \ud835\udc533) = \ud835\udc531 \u2218 \ud835\udc532 \u2218 \ud835\udc533. Thus, we can drop all parentheses without affecting the results.\nWe can also do a composition of a formula with itself, i.e.:\n\ud835\udc531 \u2218 \ud835\udc532 \u2218 \u2026 \u2218 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5f \u2218 \u2026 \u2218 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc5b, when \ud835\udc531 = \ud835\udc532 = \u22ef = \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5f = \u22ef = \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5b.\nFor example:\nIf (x is y's father) was (x \ud835\udc53 y), then (x is z's grandfather) is (x \ud835\udc532 z).\nIn formula composition, destination (output) of the first formula becomes source (input) of\nthe second one. Thus we write \ud835\udc532(\ud835\udc531(\ud835\udc65)) to describe (\ud835\udc531 \u2218 \ud835\udc532)(\ud835\udc65), i.e., we first look for \ud835\udc531(\ud835\udc65) and then for \ud835\udc532(\ud835\udc531(\ud835\udc65)). Also, we write \ud835\udc531(\ud835\udc532(\ud835\udc65)) to describe (\ud835\udc532 \u2218 \ud835\udc531)(\ud835\udc65), i.e., we first look for \ud835\udc532(\ud835\udc65) and then for \ud835\udc531(\ud835\udc532(\ud835\udc65)). In general, \ud835\udc531 \u2218 \ud835\udc532 \u2260 \ud835\udc532 \u2218 \ud835\udc531. We can also write without parentheses \ud835\udc531 \u2218 \ud835\udc532 = \ud835\udc532\ud835\udc531 , \ud835\udc532 \u2218 \ud835\udc531 = \ud835\udc531\ud835\udc532."}, {"heading": "General Structure of Linguistic Expressions", "text": "We are now ready to study the general structure of any linguistic expression.

This minimum description, however, should be completely understood by the listener, i.e., based on a common knowledge between the communication parties.\nLet us use the letters a, b, c to represent a speaker (source), a subject, and a listener\n(destination) respectively. We can encode the presence and absence of these three elements in eight distinctive states, described in the truth table (Table 1). Furthermore, the subject (or element) can appear in four distinctive states for both the speaker and the listener: either a form, or an attribute, or both a form and an attribute, or none of them. This results in four permutations for each line in Table 1. This raises the total number of distinctive communication states to 32 (Table 2). Each one of these states describes a unique communication state between the speaker and the listener regarding the subject of interest. We denote the form (formulation) and attribute (relation) with \u2217 and \u211c respectively.\nLogical development in the\nprevious sections led us to identify the principal components of any communication process: The first element (source), the second element (subject), and the third element (destination). Communication about a subject requires defining its form and attributes as seen or understood by both the source and destination. If we assign to each one of these components a \"1\" for existence and a \"0\" for absence, then we will get a five-bit binary code describing each and all-possible communication states as shown in Table 2. Theses bits from left to right represent the source, the subject, the destination,\nform of the subject, and attributes of that subject, respectively.\nLet us take an example the code \"10110\". We start with the leftmost bit. It represents the\navailability (existence) of source \"1\"; the absence of subject \"0\"; the availability of destination \"1\"; the mutual availability \"1\" of form of the absent subject in both minds of source and destination; and finally the rightmost bit represents the mutual absence \"0\" of attributes of the absent subject in both source and destination minds. Note that form and attributes of a subject do not appear or disappear on their own. These are relative concepts described only with regard to the mental state of both source and destination. As a result, language does not only care about the speaker mental state but also the listener.\nNow, if we give each distinctive communication state a symbol that identifies it completely from other states, we get the complete set of communication alphabet. This alphabet is based on the intrinsic and innate principles of UG introduced above, thus, it is capable of transferring knowledge completely and accurately. Analyzing the abstract meaning of the code \u201c10110\u201d above seems difficult and un-natural. Not to mention, linking this abstract concept to our physical world and combining tens or hundreds of these codes at a time. Language is, indeed, a great feat. However, our human brain, and maybe other advanced brains, is so complex and so powerful. It is customized to analyze these abstract codes and extract their meanings on the fly. Remember that many of other human, and non-human, activities are actually extremely complex, e.g., moving your body from point A to point B involves complex kinematics and dynamics calculations to control hundreds of muscles; visual tracking involves storing, processing and analysis of huge amounts of visual data, etc. We perform all these activities without breaking a sweat because our brains are designed to do so, and language, is not, by any means, different. The human brain, and probably other brains, come already equipped with the language engine that can decode this cosmic UG. This engine interfaces with another encoding/decoding modules that specify how to physically convey this language using sounds, gestures, inscriptions, etc.\nFigure 2 shows a suggested block diagram for the language process inside our brains. The\nlanguage decoders perform the task of converting physical signals into alphabet letters or digital codes. These concatenated codes represent composed formulas as we showed earlier. These formulas are fed into the UG engine that convolutely parses each one of them until a single or multiple values are calculated for the entire expression. These values are then analyzed in order to take actions, such as retrieving a memory, performing numerical calculation, logical inference, etc. The results of these actions need now to be formulated in a suitable expression containing all needed information. The encoders encapsulate the expression digital codes with physical signals to be transmitted by the appropriate device. The contents of the UG engine are speculative and not fully understood. Both modules that parse or build an expression depend on general principles of UG for their operation. Note that all modules in Figure 2 are biological except the UG. UG is a set of fixed, universal, cosmic rules that define how language is parsed on the most abstract level. All other modules can evolve and differ between creatures, generations and even individuals. This structure explains why infants (Kennison 2014; Sakai 2005) can learn any language better than adults. The only logical explanation is that their language encoders/decoders are not defined yet. These modules are defined by the environment and they can be easily replaced at an early age. Once the environment defines these modules, repetition and parents/teachers help solidify these encoders/decoders in the infant neural structure so that it becomes difficult to change them. What about the UG engine itself? It was transferred to us through our genes and this is the biological root that current researchers believe UG might have.\nDecode\nUG Engine\nUG\nEncode\nCalculate the expression or\nsentence(s)\nAnalyze\nthe\nresult(s)\nTake action(s),\ne.g., recall\nmemory, logical\ninference, etc.\nConstruct the answer,\ni.e., build an\nexpression to deliver the analysis result(s)\nSound, inscription,\ngesture\nSound, inscription,\ngesture\nAlphabet (codes)\nAlphabet (codes)\nFigure 2 Language Process Block Diagram"}, {"heading": "UG-compatible Natural Languages", "text": "Based on the discussion above, we can, in theory, build a formal language that embodies all\nUG rules and thus achieves the perfect communication. The important question would be; what about natural languages? Do UG-compatible natural languages actually exist? This is the same decades-old question in linguistics about whether formal natural languages exist or not. Before we present our results, it is worth to say that whether there are truly formal natural languages or not, we believe some or many natural languages should be at least near-formal, given that nature always strives for optimality. A formal natural language is the optimal solution for communication and hundreds of thousands of years of homo-sapiens evolution should result in a near-optimal communication solution.\nThe 32 digital codes in Table 2, or the communication alphabet, constitute what we call the\nDigital Alphabet. It is intriguing to check whether this digital alphabet maps partially or totally to any of the existing natural alphabets. Since our first language is Arabic, which is one of the old spoken Semitic languages (Woodard 2008), it made sense to start with it as a good candidate. The results were, indeed, interesting; however, not conclusive. We are conducting extensive research to understand more about UG and the digital alphabet. It is worth to mention that many of our results may apply to other languages as well, especially the old ones that have not been affected much by man-made artificial grammar and synonyms. It will be just a matter of figuring out the encoding of this language, i.e., how its alphabet is mapped to the digital alphabet. In our case, it was straightforward and required only a couple of iterations. Again, we should not expect natural languages to be fully formal or UG-compatible. There is always a place for randomness in nature.\nCombining Table 2 with the Arabic alphabet ordered using the abjadi order yields Table 3.\nRearranging Table 3 in eight rows and four columns yields Table 4, which is used throughout the paper. It describes 25 = 32 unique communication states and their appropriate Arabic letters. Surprisingly, Arabic alphabet has 28 consonants + 4 vowels (three vowels and the absence of all\n(Daniels 2013).\nThe last row in Table 4 describes the vowels (diacritics) or \u1e25arak\u0101t (\u0652\u0652\u062a\u0627\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0631\u064e\u062d\u064e) in Arabic. They are sequenced as following: \u1e0dammah, fat\u1e25ah, kasrah and suk\u016bn. Table 4 is also called the Alphabetical Truth Table. Since Arabic alphabet maps completely to the digital alphabet and thus encodes all possible communication states between a speaker and a listener, it completely covers the knowledge theory. Our theory proves that Arabic (at least the core unmodified part of it) is indeed a semantic language and not a syntactic one. It is a formulation of logical components and not a combination of phonetics.\nThe Digital Alphabet starts with 11111, which we name\u2019alif ( \u0627 ). It is derived from the Arabic word\u2019elfah (\u0629\u0641\u0644\u0652\u0625\u0650) or affinity. It means all three formulation elements are present (the first three ones from the left), and both source and destination have a complete mutual knowledge about the subject including its form and attributes (the last two ones). In other words, both source and destination have a complete agreement or affinity about this subject. The digital alphabet ends with 00000 or suk\u016bn (\u0652\u0652\u0646\u0648\u0652\u0643\u064f\u0633\u064f). It means silence or more precisely nullity. There is simply nothing, everything is absent including the speaker.\nUsing Table 4, we find that fat\u1e25ah (00010) is nothing but a formulation/operation (form),\nkasrah (00001) is a relation (attribute), \u1e0dammah (00011) is both a form and attribute, and suk\u016bn (00000) is neither form nor attribute, it is nothing. Since the element itself and the two communicating parties are absent from these four letters, we find the diacritics to define the element's space/time state. The diacritics in space describe the availability or absence of form and attributes; while in time, they describe the sequence of appearance of both form and attributes.\nFat\u1e25ah denotes past because it describes a form that already existed. Indeed, all past tense\nverbs in Arabic must end in fat\u1e25ah. Ending the word with fat\u1e25ah means that we started formulation with it, since formula composition works from the last written (inner) formula to the first written (outer) one as shown ealier. This means the speaker started this formula (word) by telling the listener that it already happened in the past. Kasrah, on the other hand, denotes future because it describes the attributes of an object only, i.e., it identifies the object before it takes a form, which is going to happen in future. The single-letter imperative verbs in Arabic always end with kasrah in order to make clear the imperative future tense of the verb, e.g., ri (\u0652\u0650\u0631) or look and qi (\u0652\u0650\u0642) or protect. \u1e0cammah denotes present because it describes both form and attributes of an object, i.e., it is past and future occurring together and that is the present tense. All present tense verbs in Arabic must end in \u1e0dammah as well. Finally, suk\u016bn denotes time and space independence. It is the absence of form and attributes together at the same time, which leads to a timeless/placeless definition. This is usually the \u201cabstract\u201d definition of an element. In fact, all verbal nouns in Arabic (the time independent versions of these verbs) end in suk\u016bn.\nGiven that diacritics describe the element (formula) space/time definition, we should\nformulate any formula using diacritics, i.e., they should be applied to all formulas (expressions) because all formulas satisfy the space and time principles. Linguistically, we find that any Arabic word or expression has diacritics, whether they were written or not.\nThe short discussion above illustrates the powerful results that can emerge from deep\nanalyses of the UG and the digital alphabet. There are much more to discover about language, grammar and how we process and analyze our environment. The next section presents many more results and examples that help understand more about UG and the digital alphabet, and at the same time, explain many of the Arabic language properties that have been mysterious to researchers for hundreds of years."}, {"heading": "Results and Examples", "text": "We will study in this section some single-, double- and triple-letter Arabic formulas as a\ntutorial on how to research and analyze a language using our developed UG and the digital alphabet. There will be many Arabic words throughout the discussion. The English translation is provided in italics wherever possible. Readers unfamiliar with Arabic language, however, can simply skip this part. It is only intended to present a few examples out of countless others.\nBefore we start we need to reemphasize an important concept; Formulation, as we said\nearlier, starts with the last formula and ends with the first one: \ud835\udc531 \u2218 \ud835\udc532 = \ud835\udc532\ud835\udc531 , \ud835\udc532 \u2218 \ud835\udc531 = \ud835\udc531\ud835\udc532. This means if we want to construct a word (formula) from the two letters \ud835\udc531 and \ud835\udc532 (formulas too), we have to write \ud835\udc532\ud835\udc531(\ud835\udc65), i.e., the second letter \ud835\udc532 is written first and then the first letter \ud835\udc531. It also applies to Arabic, formulation starts with the last written letter and ends with the first written one.\nEvery sentence is a formula comprised of multiple words (formulas) and each one of them is comprised of multiple letters, which represent the basic (atomic) formulas.\nWe found the letter\u2019alif (11111 \u0627) to give the affinity meaning, i.e., the complete knowledge and agreement of both communication parties about the available communicated subject. The letter b\u0101\u2019 (11110 \u0628)\u0652is the knowledge of both communication ends of only the form of an available subject. Letter j\u012bm (11101 \u062c)\u0652on the other hand, is the knowledge of both communication ends of only the attributes of an available subject. The element\u2019s formulation is what gives its shape, template, or definition. When the element itself is available, then describing its formulation without any specific attributes, as in letter b\u0101\u2019, means the element is undergoing transformation; or it had already transformed into its current form but we cannot identify its specific details (attributes) yet. This is why the letter b\u0101\u2019 appears at the beginning of many words involving transformation from one form into another, e.g., ended up (\u0621\u0627\u0628) , sold (\u0639\u0627\u0628) , cried (\u0649\u0643\u0628) , moved far away )\u062f\u0639\u064f\u0628\u064e(, etc. In the case of j\u012bm, we cannot identify the available subject form because it is either too big, or too wide, or too far, etc., to be comprehended by humans. If the subject is not physical, maybe it cannot take a specific form. Examples include words such as paradise )\u0629\u0646\u062c(, hell )\u0645\u064a\u062d\u062c/\u0645\u0646\u0647\u062c(, demons )\u0646\u062c(, mountain )\u0644\u0628\u062c(, etc.\nBoth letters b\u0101\u2019 and j\u012bm can be interpreted in a different way based on our previous\nspace/time discussion. The form transformation with b\u0101\u2019 refers to a spatial/physical transformation, i.e., the element is moving into or out of this space/form regardless of time. The emphasize, here, is not about the change, it is about the result, which is general and not completely identified. In the case of j\u012bm, where attributes transformation refers to a change in time, the element is moving into or out of this time slot regardless of its space/form. The emphasize, here, is not about the result, it is about the change. These concepts show up clearly in the following examples. The word ended up )\u0621\u0627\u0628( refers to a change in form or state where the surrounding words usually specify the new form/state, i.e., the transformation result. The word came )\u0621\u0627\u062c( on the other hand, refers to a change of location with time, i.e., mobility, and surrounding words usually specify the new/old place to emphasize the transformation itself.\nThere is no problem about different interpretations of the same formula as long as they do not\nlogically contradict. This is a norm in math since it is an abstract description of our physical world. A second-order equation may be interpreted as a projectile trajectory, a current/voltage relationship in a circuit, or describing change of temperature in a living room. We cannot say, however, that it describes a straight line because this statement contradicts the equation\u2019s basic abstract second-order properties.\nThe combination of these simple 32 letters in a formula opens the door for endless\ninterpretations and possibilities. Some formulas are already used and widespread, some of them are seldom used and others no body heard about them at all. Take for example the word door )\u0628\u0627\u0628(. If we take the space interpretation of letter b\u0101\u2019, then the formula refers to an affinity (\u2019alif) between two spaces (the two b\u0101\u2019 letters). A door allows the communicating parties to share complete information/knowledge/value between two places, two worlds, or two different forms of things. This is the most abstract and accurate definition of doors that one can come up with. If we\nexperiment a little and replace the two b\u0101\u2019 letters with j\u012bm letters, we expect to get a formula that connects two elements in two different time episodes. This formula is )\u062c\u0627\u062c(. It is not used in Arabic. However, small modifications will turn this unused formula into a widely known word. Add the letter \u2018ayn (10000 \u0639) for example to get traces )\u062c\u0627\u062c\u0639(. It is a word used to describe dirt and sand coming from the ground when there is something large moving (an army, a caravan, a horse, etc.) Notice that this movement described by )\u062c\u0627\u062c( is only available to the speaker and the moving subject itself is not available. This word is only used for hidden subjects. You see the traces of the army moving but the sand and dirt cloud is so large (meaning a lot of momentum and power) that it is hiding the army itself. If you use the letter \u1e25\u0101\u2019 (11000 \u062d), the only difference is that the moving element is actually available with the speaker only and not the listener. This means the element came to the speaker and this coming involved mobility (change with time). The word (\u062d \u0652\u062c)\u062c\u0627 means pilgrim in Arabic, which is exactly what the formula described. (The extra j\u012bm is used to emphasize mobility.)\nOne of the important statements that one can make about UG is that it describes everything\nwas, is, and going to be said in language. It allows us to make new words for future needs just as easy as we make larger and larger numbers whenever we need them.\nThere are many words (formulas) starting with\u2019alif, or using traditional definitions ending with letter\u2019alif. Every formula starting with\u2019alif (a word ending with\u2019alif ) means both speaker and listener have affinity with the second (available) element or the subject which this word is describing. The subject could be a singular masculine one, e.g.: threw )\u0627\u0645\u0631\u0652:\u0652\u0649\u0645\u0631(, gave \u0652:\u0652\u0649\u0637\u0639\u0623( )\u0627\u0637\u0639\u0623, boy )\u0627\u062a\u0641\u0652:\u0652\u0649\u062a\u0641(, etc. It can also be a singular feminine, e.g.: Layla (a name) )\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0644\u0652:\u0652\u0649\u0644\u064a\u0644(, thirsty )\u0627\u0634\u0637\u0639\u0652:\u0652\u0649\u0634\u0637\u0639(, etc. It is possible to have a dual or plural subject, e.g., (they both) hit )\u0627\u0628\u0631\u0636(, (they both) wandered )\u0627\u064a\u0639\u0633(, hills \u0627\u0628\u0631\u064f\u0652:\u0652\u0649\u0628\u0631\u064f() , etc. These examples show that starting a formula with\u2019alif does not have any duality, plurality, or feminine effect (as usually believed in Arabic grammar). It is used to show the affinity of both the speaker and listener with the subject described by this word. This affinity takes place with an available subject, which its form and attributes are completely known by both communication ends.\nThere are many formulas starting with two\u2019alif letters as well, or as traditionally said, words with\u2019alif and a hamzah at the end (hamzah is an\u2019alif with suk\u016bn, which adds an extra meaning but we will not go here into more levels of details to save time.) The first\u2019alif is an affinity of both the speaker and listener with the available subject. The second\u2019alif, which is formulated/combined with the first one, is also an affinity of both the speaker and listener with an available subject. This subject itself is an affinity with another available subject given the first\u2019alif, i.e., it is an affinity combined with another affinity. This results in widening the effective space of this affinity, i.e. targeting a wider space. The following examples clarify this point: (came \u0621\u0627\u062c, desert \u0621\u0627\u0631\u062d\u0635, sky \u0621\u0627\u0645\u0633, enemies \u0621\u0627\u062f\u0639\u0623, water \u0621\u0627\u0645, etc.) It is obvious that the described subjects are either\nwide, large, far or simply uncountable/unmeasurable. Thus, the speaker had to use two\u2019alif letters, or double affinity, to make sure the listener understands the described subject clearly (and understands its dimensions).\nAfter we studied the effect of\u2019alif at the beginning of the formula, let us study its effect at the end of it. Every formula ending with an\u2019alif (a word staring with an\u2019alif), describes a mutual definition, i.e., a mutual understanding between the speaker and listener about the entire form and attributes definition of an available subject, which is the formula itself. In other words, adding\u2019alif at the end of the formula (at the beginning of the word) implies that both communication ends now have a mutual comprehensive definition of that formula or word. The following examples show how the formula is shared between the two communication parties by introducing an\u2019alif to the end of it: (preparation \u062f\u0627\u062f\u0639\u0625, came \u0644\u0628\u0642\u0623, hit \u0628\u0631\u0636\u0625, dedication \u0621\u0627\u062f\u0647\u0625, announcement \u063a\u0644\u0627\u0628\u0625, etc.)\nAs a result, we see that ending a formula with\u2019alif is a sign of mutual definition or mutual understanding between the speaker and listener about the available subject (the formula itself). It is not a sign of a singular, a feminine, or a plural subject. Here, also, we find many words that start with two\u2019alif letters, or formulas ending with two\u2019alif letters. Using a similar analysis, we conclude that starting a word with two\u2019alif letters is nothing but a mutual definition of a mutual definition of that word, i.e., expanding the space of mutual definition and emphasizing it. For example: later )\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0623\u0652:\u0652\u0644\u062c\u0622(, ruins )\u0631\u0627\u062b\u0627\u0623\u0652:\u0652\u0631\u0627\u062b\u0622(, sinner )\u0645\u062b\u0627\u0623\u0652:\u0652\u0645\u062b\u0622(, coming )\u064a\u062a\u0627\u0623\u0652:\u0652\u064a\u062a\u0622(, etc.\nThe use of letter\u2019alif is not restricted only to the beginning and end of the word, rather inside it too. The meaning will change depending on\u2019alif position and on the letters before and after.\nLet us take the following formula two men (\u0646\u0644\u0627\u062c\u0631). The letter\u0652n\u016bn (10010 \u0646) means that only the speaker (because the listener is absent) knows only the form of an absent element. Knowledge of element's form only, means knowing the general template of that element, i.e., the speaker knows this element generally, without details. An explicit example for this is the formula a man (\u0646\u0644\u062c\u0631\u0652=\u0652\u0644\u064c\u062c\u0631). Here we started the formula with letter n\u016bn to imply that the formula (\u0644\u062c\u0631) is general and not specific (indefinite form). It is only a form of the formula man (\u0644\u062c\u0631), i.e., the general or template case without specifying a unique man.\nFor any countable formula to be general (indefinite), it should describe at least two elements.\nIf it describes only one, then the formula is unique and identified. If we combine the letter n\u016bn with\u2019alif as in (\u0646\u0627), then the subject which was previously absent and known only generally with n\u016bn, is now available and completely known to the speaker and listener with\u2019alif. The introduction of affinity to the general knowledge means this formula describes only two elements, not less and not more, in case the element was countable as in two men (\u0646\u0644\u0627\u062c\u0631). Describing a\nsingle element contradicts with the general knowledge brought by n\u016bn and describing more than two elements does not allow for a complete affinity as expressed by\u2019alif.\nIn case the subject was uncountable, the formula describes an unspecified widely known\nelement that is the subject itself, as in full (with food) (\u0646\u0627\u0639\u0628\u0634). The subject here (\u0639\u0628\u0634) is a general formula but completely known to both speaker and listener. The following examples show the effect of (\u0646\u0627) in countable and uncountable subjects: (full \u0646\u0627\u0639\u0628\u0634, two men \u0646\u0644\u0627\u062c\u0631, two \u0625\u0646\u0627\u0646\u062b , mortal \u0646\u0627\u0641, these two \u0646\u0627\u062a\u0627\u0647, sorrows \u0646\u0627\u062c\u0634\u0623, etc.)\nTo summarize, the use of (\u0646\u0627) at the beginning of a formula denotes the definition of a subject which was previously absent and known generally by the speaker via its form and now it is available and completely known by both communication parties. This abstract definition of (\u0646\u0627) does not specify whether the subject is singular or plural, whether it is dual or more, etc. The nature of the formula itself determines such details.\nMoving forward, let us take the formula the book (\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0643\u0644\u0627). We study it as follows: (((\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0643) \u0644 )\u0627) where we consider the formula book (\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0643) to be already known and defined. As usual, we start with the beginning of the formula (the end of the word). The letter\u0652l\u0101m (10100 \u0644) means the previous formula book (\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0643) is nothing but an unavailable subject that the speaker and listener know neither its form nor its attributes, i.e. the formula book (\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0643) is neither known nor identified by communicating parties. Now we add the letter\u2019alif and the previously absent and unknown formula book (\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0643) becomes available and completely known to both of them. We conclude that formulating any formula with the (\u0644\u0627) means the affinity of communication parties with an available formula that was previously absent and unknown to both of them, i.e., the tool the (\u0644\u0627) defines and specifies this formula completely; hence, we call it the definition tool.\nNow let us take this formula do not play ( \u0652\u0644\u0627\u0628\u0639\u0644\u062a ). We study it as follows: (((\u0628\u0639\u0644\u062a) \u0627 )\u0652\u0644 ) where we consider the formula\u0652play (\u0628\u0639\u0644\u062a) to be already known and defined. Starting with\u2019alif, both the speaker and listener have a complete affinity and knowledge of the previous formula play (\u0628\u0639\u0644\u062a). Adding the letter l\u0101m (10100 \u0644), the known formula becomes absent and completely unidentified by communication parties. This means the tool not (\u0644\u0627) took a previously available and known formula and transferred it to an unavailable and completely unknown one, i.e., the tool not (\u0644\u0627) negated or canceled the definition of that formula; hence, we call it the negation tool. Note that formulation with the (\u0644\u0627) is exactly contrary to the formulation with not (\u0644\u0652\u0652=\u0652\u0644\u0627).\nWe will start now analyzing some bi-letter formulas where we fix the second letter (l\u0101m) and\nchange the first letter to study the effect on meaning. We start with the formulas (the \u0652\u0652\u0644\u0623\u064e, showed up \u0652\u0652\u0644\u0647\u064e, walked away \u0652\u0652\u0644\u0641\u064e, appeared \u0652\u0652\u0644\u0637\u064e). We studied the first formula the (\u0652\u0652\u0644\u0623\u064e) earlier and found its\nmeaning to be the complete affinity of both speaker and listener with an available subject that was previously unavailable and unknown for both of them, i.e., they both defined the subject clearly. In the second formula showed up (\u0652\u0652\u0644\u0647\u064e), the letter h\u0101\u2019 (11011 \u0647) means only the speaker knows the complete form and attributes of an available subject. This means the speaker here attained a complete knowledge about an available subject that was previously unavailable and unknown for both communication parties, i.e., the subject came close to the speaker physically or mentally.\nNow moving to the formula walked away (\u0652\u0652\u0644\u0641\u064e), and looking at the letters' f\u0101\u2019 (01111 \u0641\u0652 ) and l\u0101m (10100 \u0644); We see that only the listener here gained a complete knowledge about an available subject that was previously unavailable and unknown for both communication parties, i.e., the subject escaped/sneaked toward the listener physically or mentally. In other words, it walked away from the speaker.\nIt should be clear now the movement introduced in the three formulas (the \u0652\u0652\u0644\u0623\u064e, showed up \u0652\u0652\u0644\u0647\u064e, walked away \u0652\u0652\u0644\u0641\u064e) by exchanging the letters\u2019alif, h\u0101\u2019 and f\u0101\u2019. First the subject was absent using l\u0101m, and then it became available and known by either both the speaker and listener (\u2019alif), or the speaker alone (h\u0101\u2019), or the listener alone (f\u0101\u2019). The movement here is short and enough to transfer the subject from one state to another. Another set of letters cause a large movement that gives different physical and mental meanings.\nNow let us take the fourth formula appeared (\u0652\u0652\u0644\u0637\u064e). Using the letter \u1e6d\u0101\u2019 (10111\u0652\u0637) definition, we find its meaning to be the speaker and listener knowledge of the form and attributes of an unavailable subject that was previously unavailable and unknown for both of them. This means the speaker and listener recognized that subject without seeing it closely, i.e., it appeared from a vast distance or it appeared only through its effects or footsteps. The word ruins (\u0644\u0644\u0627\u0637\u0623) means the left signs after the original object had disappeared.\nWe will stop our analysis here despite the fact that all meaningful letters in Arabic and\nvarious different words were studied and analyzed according to our theory. The digital alphabet was tested with various one-, two-, three-, four- and five-letter words. We tested more than 150 words with positive and encouraging results. The logical and mathematical analysis of these words gave exactly the same abstract meaning. Sometimes it is quiet easy to figure out the word meaning from its abstract description, i.e., the word speaks by itself. Many times, it is not that straightforward and it requires a bit of imagination to link the abstract word with its everyday use."}, {"heading": "Conclusion and Future Remarks", "text": "We presented in this paper a new formal definition of Universal Grammar (UG). Instead of\nresearching human brain, natural languages, genetics, history and psychology for a UG, we decided to take a different path and look for the basic logic behind a UG and a language, which is the communication and knowledge transfer. We developed a theory for communication and knowledge dissemination through language. This theory provides a rigorous mathematical definition of UG that complies well with many other grand theories in physics, astronomy, philosophy, mathematical logic and computer science. Thus, allowing any language, governed by this unique UG, to be fully analyzed, decoded and comprehended.\nAfter formulating our UG and what we call the Digital Alphabet, we set out to look for a\npossibility of any natural language meeting our UG requirements. By a stroke of luck, our first trial using Arabic was positive so far. We got results that clearly show how Arabic words are constructed to give their precise meaning, giving us a lot of insight into how language, and communication in general, function. The presented work is a small part of an extensive research that has been carried out on this topic, sporadically, in the last three decades. More research have been done to understand how UG succeeds in delivering the right information, especially with regard to space and time. This resulted in extensive analyses of many grammatical features of Arabic language that touched directly with many open problems in semantics and pragmatics. Although, no result is conclusive, we think this new vision of UG and language is a gold mine of research that can be exploited in the upcoming years."}], "references": [{"title": "Aspects of the Theory of Syntax Cambridge, MA: MIT Press", "author": ["Chomsky", "Noam."], "venue": "Daniels, Peter T. 2013.

UG specifies the restricted set of languages learnable by human brain, and thus, many researchers believe in its biological roots. Numerous empirical studies of neurobiological and cognitive functions of the human brain, and of many natural languages, have been conducted to unveil some aspects of UG. This, however, resulted in different and sometimes contradicting theories that do not indicate a universally unique grammar. In this research, we tackle the UG problem from an entirely different perspective. We search for the Unique Universal Grammar (UUG) that facilitates communication and knowledge transfer, the sole purpose of a language. We formulate this UG and show that it is unique, intrinsic, and cosmic, rather than humanistic. Initial analysis on a widespread natural language already showed some positive results.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
