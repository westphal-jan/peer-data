INTRODUCTION The main aim of adaptive learning systems (ALS) is to customize the educational logic developed in their courses; those systems are considered adaptive when they can dynamically change to better suit the learning in response to information collected during the course of learning such as a learner\u2019s profile, or achievement test score.\nMany adaptive learning systems for education have emerged and have even influenced a number of recent systems (Brusilovsky, 2000). We cite for example APeLS (Conlan et al., 2005), Saxon Phonics system (Duffy, 2005) , INTERBOOK system (Brusilovsky, 1998), the system WELSA (Popescu, 2008), AHA system (De Bra, 1998a), the SmexWeb system (Koch, 2000), the system ELM-ART (Weber et al., 2001), the KOD system (Sampson, 2002), the system calls (Colan 2002), the system Alfanet (Alfanet, 2005), the system Medyna (Behaz, 2008), and the OrPAF system (Yessad, 2009), GRAPPLE project , etc.\nArchitecture of adaptive learning systems is decomposed into three main models that are required to create or automatically generate customized courses to a learner (De Bra, 2001; Brusilovsky, 2003):\n\u2022 Domain Model (DM): represents the concepts as hierarchy of learning and relationships between the concepts\n\u2022 Learner Model (LS): describe the learner's profile such as his knowledge, his characteristics and his preference.\n\u2022 Adaptation Model (AM): defines the concept selection rules that are used for selecting appropriate concepts from the domain model, as well as, the content selection rules from the media space.\nIn this paper, we focus on designing domain model based on fuzzy logic approach. The following section presents an overview of some domain model that used fuzzy logic approach.\nII. OVERVIEW OF SOME EXISTING DOMAIN MODEL BASED ON FUZZY LOGIC APPROACH\nSeveral learning systems build their domain model by using a number of different methods of fuzzy logic (Al-Sarem et al, 2010 and Chu et al., 2010 and Chen and Bai, 2008). Sue et al., 2010, used a two-phase method that extracts the association rules between the skills by applying fuzzy logic to convert the grades learners into three levels of difficulty and construct a learning hierarchy. Bai and Chen, 2010, simplified and improved the latter method in adaptive way.\nHowever, they don\u2019t take into account the possibility of using a learning hierarchy predefined by experts of a specific field, and those domain model considered grades obtained by learners during the process learning is a fuzzy notion.\nIn our previous works (Aajli and Afdel, 2014), we proposed an approach of domain model based on fuzzy logic. The idea behind it combining the hierarchy learning predefined by one expert of a specific field and that developed automatically using the fuzzy logic (Fuzzy Sets Theory), and we consider the relationships of prerequisites between the concepts in the concept map are not definitive and they are fuzzy relationships.\nIn this paper, we extend this idea by presenting it as a tool implements our domain model based on fuzzy logic and try to answer the following question: what are the best parameters of our model in order to adapt the learners\u2019 differences?\nISSN: 2313-0512 61\nBefore introducing the tool implements our domain model, the following section describes our approach of domain model based on fuzzy prerequisite relationship."}, {"heading": "III. APPROACH OF DOMAIN MODEL BASED ON FUZZY PREREQUISITE RELATIONSHIP", "text": "In this approach, we use a domain model (learning hierarchy) predefined by one or more experts of a specific field. For that we determines in first phase an initial predefined domain model, in second phase we measure the variation of grades of learners, after that we transformed the data by using the fuzzification technique, then in the next phase we mine the association rules between the concepts. In the last two phases we propose to build the final model."}, {"heading": "IV. A TOOL IMPLEMENTS THE DOMAIN MODEL BASED ON FUZZY PREREQUISITE RELATIONSHIP", "text": ""}, {"heading": "A.
