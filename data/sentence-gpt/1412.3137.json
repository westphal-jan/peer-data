An invention should be at an adequate distance beyond its prior art in order to be patented. Fulfilling a minimum measurement limit would enable a patent applicant to have its invention patented. Based on this fact, we proposed a method for nonobviousness analysis of a patent over its prior arts, based on highest court\u2019s precedents, called the FSTP1 Test [1] [2].\nThe FSTP Test works on formal descriptions of the technique teaching. To derive this formal representation of the technique teaching we need to identify different kinds of information explicitly or implicitly disclosed in the patent description and its Reference Set (RS). This formal representation identifies three main discretization levels: elements, attributes and concepts. Elements represent the important characterizing aspects of an invention, attributes represent the properties of the elements and concepts represent the elementary properties referred by the attributes.\nThe proposed method elaborates on several compliance tests defined by different National Patent Systems (NPS) on patent nonobviousness analysis and subject matter eligibility. From the scope of this paper, we consider tests (U.S.C 35 \u00a7101, \u00a7102, \u00a7103, \u00a7112 \u2026) [3] defined by the U.S. Supreme Court and Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC), and the order in which such test are to be applied as depicted by U.S CAFC, in its recent decisions of, RETRACTABLE TECH [4] and PHILIPS [5]. Furthermore, U.S CAFC also highlighted the imminent need for discretization levels before applying such tests.\nFor transforming facts, indentified on different discretization levels into the quantified semantic facts, the FSTP test provides a platform for applying series of compliance tests from the Title 35 of United States Code for patent law (35 U.S.C) to support its existing semantic and pragmatic layers. On the first stage, norms pertaining to U.S.C 35 \u00a7112 are applied to determine the claimed inventions inventive concepts and thereby, its semantics over its prior art. Subsequently, U.S.C 35 \u00a7102/103 tests for determining the claimed inventions patentability semantics as indicated by the facts are applied. Finally facts that qualify the first and the second stages of tests are subject to U.S.C 35 \u00a7101 compliance test for its patent-eligible pragmatics. To sum up, all semantic/creative facts need to be validated in a given order and in accordance to the respective NPS under consideration for justifying the pragmatic/ innovative height of the patent\u2019s invention over its prior art.\n1 This work has been supported by the Fact Screening and Transforming Processor (FSTP) project funded by the Teles Pri GmbH: www.fstp-expert-system.com\nIn order to perform such compliance tests, legal norms need to be transformed from their natural language format to a formal representation format. We propose to use LegalRuleML [6], an XML standard for legal knowledge representation based on RuleML [7] and which supports the modelling of norms. We use it for representing patent norms and their case law decisions as legal rules. It resolves complex legal questions and automates the analysis of a large number of patent norms with respect to their logical coherence in a given NPS. It can also be used to point out logical inconsistencies in current case law decisions and can be used to evaluate compliance of semantic facts with case law and positive law.\nFor legal reasoning, we propose to convert LegalRuleML into RuleML, which then can be evaluated using a rule reasoner as shown in Fig 1.\nThe formal FSTP facts identified in the first layer need to be annotated in order to allow the reasoner to evaluate the corresponding rules. We use both linguistic and ontological information as a base for annotations in connection with the rules semantics.\nSuch system supports life cycle management of the knowledge. It captures the changes over time of the rules when the legal binding text changes. Updates in the NPSs by new decisions will lead to corresponding isomorphic updates in the NPSs knowledge bases.\nFigure 1 : Legal norm validation of FSTP facts using rule reasoning\nWe are implementing a prototype in conjunction with the FSTP expert system [1] for rule based patent norm reasoning. In particular, we are addressing specific sections from national patent system connected to nonobviousness analysis. For rule reasoning we use Prova [8], a java based open source rule language for reactive agents and event processing."}], "references": [{"title": "THE FSTP EXPERT SYSTEM, WO 2012/022612 A1 (to SIGRAM SCHINDLER BETEILIGUNGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH [DE/DE]; Ernst-Reuter-Platz", "author": ["\u201cSchindler", "Sigram"], "venue": "Berlin (DE)),", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2012}, {"title": "The FSTP Test: a novel approach for an invention\u2019s non-obviousness analysis", "author": ["S.
