Identifying knowledge with the former and belief with the latter, we may think of $c$ as the agent's betting threshold, which leads to the motto \"belief is willingness to bet.\" The logic $\\mathsf{KB.5}$ for $c=\\frac 12$ has an $\\mathsf{S5}$ $K$ modality along with a sub-normal $B$ modality that extends the minimal modal logic $\\mathsf{EMND45}$ by way of four schemes relating $K$ and $B$, one of which is a complex scheme arising out of a theorem due to Scott. Lenzen was the first to use Scott's theorem to show that a version of this logic is sound and complete for the probability interpretation. We reformulate Lenzen's results and present them here in a modern and accessible form. In addition, we introduce a new epistemic neighborhood semantics that will be more familiar to modern modal logicians. Using Scott's theorem, we provide the Lenzen-derivative properties that must be imposed on finite epistemic neighborhood models so as to guarantee the existence of a probability measure respecting the neighborhood function in the appropriate way for threshold $c=\\frac 12$. This yields a link between probabilistic and modal neighborhood semantics that we hope will be of use in future work on modal logics of qualitative probability. We leave open the question of which properties must be imposed on finite epistemic neighborhood models so as to guarantee existence of an appropriate probability measure for thresholds $c\\neq\\frac 12$. If a quantifier satisfies a modality in the condition of a probabilistic probability measure using one of those properties, then a probability measure for the probability measure can be applied to the value of the quantifier in the condition of a probabilistic probability measure that includes a nonzero probability measure that satisfies the boundary between probability and the bound to a threshold for the probability measure that includes a nonzero probability measure with a nonzero probability measure that includes a nonzero probability measure that includes a nonzero probability measure that includes a nonzero probability measure that includes a nonzero probability measure that includes a nonzero probability measure that includes a nonzero probability measure that includes a nonzero probability measure that includes a nonzero probability measure", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Dec 2014 17:34:25 GMT  (40kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5090v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 17 Dec 2014 22:49:14 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5090v2", "Removed date from v1 to avoid confusion on citation/reference, otherwise identical to v1"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["jan van eijck", "bryan renne"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.5090"}, "pdf": {"name": "1412.5090.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Jan van Eijck", "Bryan Renne"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar X\niv :1\n41 2.\n50 90\nv2 [\ncs .L\nO ]\n1 7\nD ec\n2 01"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "De Finetti [dF51, dF37] proposed the following axiomatization of qualitative probabilistic comparison (presented here based on [Sco64]): for sets X , Y , and Z coming from the powerset \u2118(W ) of a nonempty finite set W , we have\n1.

X Y Z implies X Z, and\n5. X Y if and only if X \u222a Z Y \u222a Z for Z disjoint from X and Y .\nDe Finetti conjectured that any binary relation on \u2118(W ) that satisfies these conditions is realizable by a probability measure P on \u2118(W ), which means that we have X Y if and only if P (X) \u2264 P (Y ). While every probability measure realizing a binary relation on \u2118(W ) satisfies de Finetti\u2019s conditions, these conditions do not in general guarantee the existence of a realizing probability measure: it was shown by Kraft, Pratt, and Seidenberg [KPS59] (presented here as in [Seg71]) that for W = {a, b, c, d, e}, the relations\n{c} \u227a {a, b}, {b, d} \u227a {a, c},\n{a, e} \u227a {b, c}, {a, b, c} \u227a {d, e}\nmay be extended to a binary relation over \u2118(W ) that satisfies de Finetti\u2019s conditions and yet has no realizing probability measure. Kraft, Pratt, and Seidenberg (\u201cKPS\u201d) also determined what was missing from de Finetti\u2019s axiomatization; Scott [Sco64] later presented the KPS conditions in a linear algebraic form.\nTheorem 1.1 ([Sco64, Theorem 4.1] reformulated with \u2118(W ) instead of a general Boolean algebra). Let W be a nonempty finite set. Given X \u2208 \u2118(W ), let \u03b9 : W \u2192 {0, 1} be the characteristic function of X (i.e., \u03b9(X)(w) = 1 if w \u2208 X , and \u03b9(X)(w) = 0 if w /\u2208 X). Construe functions x : W \u2192 R as vectors: x(w) indicates the real-number value of vector x at coordinate w. Addition and negation of these vectors is taken component-wise: (x + y)(w) := x(w) + y(w) and (\u2212x)(w) := \u2212(x(w)). A binary relation on \u2118(W ) is realizable by a probability measure if and only if it satisfies each of the following: for each m \u2208 Z+ and X, Y,X1, . . . , Xm, Y1, . . . , Ym \u2208 \u2118(W ), we have\n1. \u2205 \u227a W ;\n2. \u2205 X;\n3. X Y or Y X; and\n4. if Xi Yi for each i \u2264 m and \u2211m i=1 \u03b9(Xi) = \u2211m j=1 \u03b9(Yj), then Yj Xj for each j \u2264 m.\nScott\u2019s fourth condition is the most difficult. The algebraic component \u2211m\ni=1 \u03b9(Xi) = \u2211m j=1 \u03b9(Yj) (1)\nof this condition says: for each coordinate w \u2208 W , the number of Xi\u2019s that contain w is equal to the number of Yj\u2019s that contain w. Intuitively, Scott\u2019s forth condition tells us that if two length-m sequences of coordinate sets are related component-wise by the relation \u201cis no more probable than\u201d and the occurrence multiplicity of any given world is the same in each of the sequences, then the sets are also related component-wise by the relation \u201chas the same probability.\u201d\nUsing Scott\u2019s theorem to prove completeness, Segerberg [Seg71] studied a modal logic of qualitative probability. Segerberg\u2019s logic has a binary operator expressing qualitative probabilistic\ncomparison and a unary operator \u2737 expressing necessity. Ga\u0308rdenfors [Ga\u0308r75] considered a simplified version of Segerberg\u2019s logic that, among other differences, eliminated the necessity operator in lieu of the abbreviation \u2737\u03d5 := (1 \u03d5), which has the semantic meaning that \u03d5 has probability 1 (and implies that \u03d5 is true at all outcomes with nonzero probability). Both Ga\u0308rdenfors and Segerberg express the algebraic component (1) of Scott\u2019s fourth condition using Segerberg\u2019s notation\n(\u03d51, . . . , \u03d5mE\u03c81, . . . , \u03c8m) ,\nwhich we sometimes shorten to (\u03d5iE\u03c8i)mi=1. This expression abbreviates the formula\n\u2737(F0 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 Fm) ,\nwhere each Fi is the disjunction of all conjunctions\nd1\u03d51 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 dm\u03d5m \u2227 e1\u03c81 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 em\u03c8m\u2227\nsatisfying the property that exactly i of the dk\u2019s are the empty string, exactly i of the ek\u2019s are the empty string, and the rest of the dk\u2019s and ek\u2019s are the negation sign \u00ac. Intuitively, Fi says that i of the \u03d5k\u2019s are true and i of the \u03c8k\u2019s are true; F0 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 Fm says that the number of true \u03d5k\u2019s is the same as the number of true \u03c8k\u2019s; and (\u03d5iE\u03c8i)mi=1 := \u2737(F0 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 Fm) says that at every outcome with nonzero probability, the number of true \u03d5k\u2019s is the same as the number of true \u03c8k\u2019s. Using this notation, it is possible to express the fourth condition of Scott\u2019s theorem and thereby obtain completeness for the probabilistic interpretation.\nIn the present paper, we follow this tradition of studying probability from a qualitative (i.e., non-numerical) point of view using modal logic. However, our focus shall not be on the binary relation of qualitative probabilistic comparison but instead on the unary notions of certainty (i.e., having probability 1) and \u201chigh\u201d probability (i.e., having a probability greater than some fixed rational-number threshold c \u2265 1\n2 ). That is, our interest is in unary modal logics of high\nprobability. For convenience in this study, we shall identify epistemic notions with probabilistic assignment, which suggests a connection with subjective probability [Jef04]. In particular, we identify knowledge with probabilistic certainty (i.e., probability 1) and belief with probability greater than some fixed rational-number threshold c \u2265 1\n2 . Therefore, instead of the unary operator \u2737, we shall\nuse the unary operator K and assign this operator an epistemic reading: K\u03d5 says that the agent knows \u03d5, which means she assigns \u03d5 subjective probability 1. We shall use the unary modal operator B to express belief: B\u03d5 says that the agent believes \u03d5, which means she assigns \u03d5 a subjective probability exceeding the threshold c (which will always be a fixed value within a given context or theory). Though our readings of these formulas are epistemic and doxastic, we stress that our technical results are independent of this reading, so someone who disagrees with subjective probability or our epistemic/doxastic readings is encouraged to think of our work purely in terms of high probability: K\u03d5 says P (\u03d5) = 1, and B\u03d5 says P (\u03d5) > c for some fixed c \u2208 [1\n2 , 1)\u2229Q. That is, the\ntechnical results of our work are in no way dependent on our use of epistemic/doxastic notions or on the philosophy of subjective probability.\nLenzen [Len03, Len80] is to our knowledge the first to consider a modal logic of high probability for the threshold c = 1\n2 . Actually, his perspective is slightly different than the one we adopt here.\nFirst, his reading of formulas is different (though not in any deep way): he identifies \u201cthe agent is convinced of \u03d5\u201d with P (\u03d5) = 1 and \u201c\u03c8 is believed\u201d by P (\u03c8) > 1\n2 . More substantially, Lenzen\u2019s\nconviction (German: U\u0308berzeuging) does not imply truth. Technically, this amounts to permitting the possibility that there are outcomes having probability zero. For reasons of personal preference, we forbid this in our study here, though this difference is non-essential, as it is completely trivial from the technical perspective to change our setting to allow zero-probability outcomes or to change Lenzen\u2019s setting to forbid them. Therefore, we credit Lenzen\u2019s work [Len80] as the first to provide a proof of probabilistic completeness for c = 1\n2 . As with Segerberg\u2019s and Ga\u0308rdenfors\u2019\nprobabilistic completeness results, Lenzen\u2019s proof made crucial use of Scott\u2019s work. In more recent work, Herzig [Her03] considered a logic of belief and action in which belief in \u03d5 is identified with P (\u03d5) > P (\u00ac\u03d5). This is equivalent to Lenzen\u2019s notion, though Herzig does not study completeness. Another recent work by Kyberg and Teng [KT12] investigated a notion of \u201cacceptance\u201d in which \u03d5 is accepted whenever the probability of \u00ac\u03d5 is at most some small \u01eb. This gives rise to the minimal modal logic EMN, which is different than Lenzen\u2019s logic.\nWe herein consider belief a\u0300 la Lenzen not only for the case c = 1 2 but also for the case c > 1 2 . As it turns out, the logics for these cases are different, though our focus will be on the logic for c = 1\n2 because this is the only threshold for which a probability completeness result is known. In\nparticular, probability completeness for c > 1 2 is still open. Thresholds c < 1 2 permit simultaneous belief of \u03d5 and \u00ac\u03d5 while avoiding belief of any self-contradictory sentence such as the propositional constant \u22a5 for falsehood. This might suggest some connection with paraconsistent logic. However, we leave these logics of low probability for future work, though we shall say a few words more about them later in this paper.\nIn Section 2, we identify a Kripke-style semantics for probability logic similar to [EoS14, Hal03] (and no doubt to many others). We require that all worlds are probabilistically possible but not necessarily epistemically so, and we provide some examples of how this semantics works. In particular, we demonstrate that our requirement is not problematic: world v can be made to have probability zero relative to world w if we cut the epistemic accessibility relation between these worlds.\nIn Section 3, we define our modal notions of certain knowledge and of belief exceeding threshold c, explain the motto \u201cbelief is willingness to bet,\u201d and prove a number of properties of certain knowledge and this \u201cbetting\u201d belief. For instance, we show that knowledge is S5 and belief is not normal. We show a number of other threshold-specific properties of betting belief as well. In particular, we see that the belief modality extends the minimal modal logic EMND45 + \u00acB\u22a5 by way of certain schemes relating knowledge and belief.\nWe then introduce a formal modal language in Section 4, relate this language to the probabilistic notions of belief and knowledge, and introduce an epistemic neighborhood semantics for the language. We study the relationship between the neighborhood and probabilistic semantics. In particular, we introduce a notion of \u201cagreement\u201d between epistemic probability models and epistemic neighborhood models, the key component of which is this: an event X is a neighborhood of a world w if and only if the probability measure Pw at w satisfies Pw(X) > c. We use one of Scott\u2019s theorems to prove that epistemic neighborhood models satisfying certain properties give rise to agreeing epistemic probability models for the threshold c = 1\n2 . This result we credit\nto Lenzen; however, we prove this result anew in a modern, streamlined form that we hope will make it more accessible. The main remaining open problem is to prove the analogous result for thresholds c 6= 1\n2 (i.e., find the additional sufficient conditions on epistemic neighborhood models\nwe need to impose so as to guarantee the existence of an agreeing epistemic probability model for threshold c 6= 1\n2 ). Finally, we prove that epistemic probability models always give rise to agreeing\nepistemic neighborhood models. In Section 5, we introduce a basic modal theory KB that is probabilistically sound. We adapt an example due to Walley and Fine [WF79] that shows KB is probabilistically incomplete. This leads us to add additional principles to KB, thereby producing the modal theory KB.5, our name for our modern reformulation of Lenzen\u2019s modal theory of knowledge and belief (or, in Lenzen\u2019s terminology, his theory of \u201cacceptance\u201d and belief). Using the results from Section 4, we prove that this logic is sound and complete for epistemic probability models using threshold c = 1\n2 .\nRegarding the semantics based on our epistemic neighborhood models, we prove that KB is sound and complete for the full class of these models and that KB.5 is sound and complete for the smaller class that satisfies the additional Lenzen-derivative properties needed to guarantee the existence of an agreeing probability measure for threshold c = 1\n2 .\nStated in an analogy: KB is to de Finetti\u2019s axiomatization as KB.5 is to the KPS/Scott axiomatization. However, do not be misled: de Finetti, KPS, and Scott considered qualitative probabilistic comparison, which is a binary notion based on a binary operator . See also [HI13] for a revival of this tradition. We, on the other hand, consider high probability, which is a unary notion based on unary operators we denote as K and B.\nAnother version of our main open question can be restated in the following syntactic form: given a threshold c 6= 1\n2 , find the additional principles that must be added to our probabilistically\nsound but incomplete base logic KB in order to obtain a probabilistically sound and complete logic for threshold c. In our conclusion, we present some additional sound principles that might come up in this work, but we have not been able to find the probabilistically sound and complete axiomatization for thresholds c 6= 1\n2 .\nGiven the link between epistemic neighborhood models and epistemic probability models, our results may be viewed as a contribution to the study connecting two schools of rational decision making: the probabilist (e.g., [Ko\u0308r08]) and the AI-based (e.g., [KT12]). We also hope that it will be of some use in future work on qualitative probability."}, {"heading": "2 Epistemic Probability Models", "text": "Definition 2.1. We fix a set P of propositional letters. An epistemic probability model is a structure M = (W,R, V, P ) satisfying the following.\n\u2022 (W,R, V ) is a finite single-agent S5 Kripke model:\n\u2013 W is a finite nonempty set of \u201cworlds\u201d or \u201coutcomes.\u201d An event is a set X \u2286 W of worlds. When convenient, we identify a world w with the singleton event {w}.\n\u2013 R \u2286 W \u00d7W is an equivalence relation R on W . We let\n[w] := {v \u2208 W | wRv}\ndenote the equivalence class of world w.

If w is the actual world, then the probability the agent assigns to an event X at w is given by\nPw(X) := P (X \u2229 [w])\nP ([w]) . (2)\nIn words: the probability the agent assigns to event X at world w is the probability she assigns to X conditional on her knowledge at w. Slogan: subjective probability is always conditioned, and the most general condition is given by the knowledge of the agent. This makes sense because the right side of (2) is just P (X|[w]), the probability of X conditional on [w]. Note that Pw(X) is always well-defined: we have w \u2208 [w] by the reflexivity of R and hence 0 < P (w) \u2264 P ([w]) by full support, so the denominator on the right side of (2) is nonzero.\nExample 2.2 (Horse racing). Three horses compete in a race. For each i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, horse hi wins the race in world wi. The agent can distinguish between these three possibilities, and she assigns the horses winning chances of 3:2:1. We represent this situation in the form of an epistemic probability model M2.2 pictured as follows:\nh1\nw1\nh2\nw2\nh3\nw3\nP = {w1 : 3 6 , w2 : 2 6 , w3 : 1 6 }\nM2.2\nWhen we picture epistemic probability models, the arrows of the agent are to be closed under reflexivity and transitivity. With this convention in place, it is not difficult to verify that Pw1({w1, w3}) = 2 3 ; that is, at w1, the assigns probability 23 to the event that the winner is horse 1 or horse 3.\nThe property of full support says that each world is probabilistically possible. Therefore, in order to represent a situation in which the agent is certain that horse 3 can never win, we simply make the h3-worlds inaccessible via R.\nExample 2.3 (Certainty of impossibility). We modify Example 2.2 by eliminating the arrow between worlds w2 and w3.\nh1\nw1\nh2\nw2\nh3\nw3\nP = {w1 : 3 6 , w2 : 2 6 , w3 : 1 6 }\nM2.3\nAt world w1 in this picture, there is no accessible world at which horse 3 wins. Therefore, at world w1, the agent assigns probability 0 to the event that horse 3 wins: Pw1(w3) = 0.\nWe define a language L for reasoning about epistemic probability models.\nDefinition 2.4.

We define the relational symbols \u2264, >, <, and = in terms of \u2265 as usual. For example, t = s abbreviates (t \u2265 s) \u2227 (s \u2265 t).

In particular, fix a threshold c = p/q \u2208 (0, 1) \u2229 Q. Suppose that the agent believes \u03d5 with threshold c = p/q; that is, P (\u03d5) > p/q.

This is a positive number of dollars if and only if q \u00b7 P (\u03d5) > p. But notice that the latter is guaranteed by the assumption P (\u03d5) > p/q. Therefore, it is rational for the agent to take this bet. Said in the parlance of the subjective probability literature: \u201cIf the agent stakes p to win q in a bet on \u03d5, then her winning expectation is positive in case she believes \u03d5 with threshold c = p/q.\u201d Or in a short motto: \u201cBelief is willingness to bet.\u201d\nRemark 3.4. Belief based on threshold c = 0 or c = 1 is trivial to express in terms of negation, K, and falsehood \u22a5. So we do not consider these thresholds here. Beliefs based on low-thresholds c \u2208 (0, 1\n2 ) \u2229 Q have unintuitive and unusual features. First, low-threshold beliefs unintuitively permit inconsistency of the kind that an agent can believe both \u03d5 and \u00ac\u03d5 while avoiding inconsistency of the kind that the agent can believe a self-contradictory formula such as \u22a5. (This suggests some connection with paraconsistent logic.) Second, the dual of a low-threshold belief implies the belief at that threshold (i.e., B\u030cc\u03d5 \u2192 Bc\u03d5), which is unusual if we assign the usual \u201cconsistency\u201d reading to dual operators (i.e., \u201c\u03d5 is consistent with the agent\u2019s beliefs implies \u03d5 is believed\u201d is unusual). Since low-threshold c \u2208 (0, 1\n2 ) \u2229 Q beliefs have these unintuitive and unusual features, we leave\ntheir study for future work, focusing instead on thresholds c \u2208 [1 2 , 1) \u2229Q.\nThe following lemma provides a useful characterization of the dual B\u030cc\u03d5.\nLemma 3.5. Let M = (W,R, V, P ) be an epistemic probability model.\n1. M, w |=p B\u030cc\u03d5 iff M, w |=p P (\u03d5) \u2265 1\u2212 c.\n2. M, w |=p B\u030c 1 2\u03d5 iff M, w |=p P (\u03d5) \u2265 12 .\nProof. For Item 1, we have the following:\nM, w |=p B\u030cc\u03d5\niff M, w |=p \u00acBc\u00ac\u03d5 by definition of B\u030cc\u03d5\niff Pw(J\u00ac\u03d5Kp) 6> c by definition of Bc\u03d5 and |=p\niff Pw(J\u00ac\u03d5Kp) \u2264 c since Q is totally ordered\niff Pw(J\u03d5Kp) \u2265 1\u2212 c since J\u00ac\u03d5Kp = W \u2212 J\u03d5Kp\nFor Item 2, apply Item 1 with c = 1 2 .\nWe now consider a simple example.\nExample 3.6 (Non-normality). In this variation, all horses have equal chances of winning and the agent knows this.\nh1\nw1\nh2\nw2\nh3\nw3\nP = {w1 : 1 3 , w2 : 1 3 , w3 : 1 3 }\nM3.6\nRecalling that an omitted threshold c is implicitly assumed to be 1 2 , the following are readily verified.\n1. M3.6 |=p B(h1 \u2228 h2 \u2228 h3).\nThe agent believes the winning horse is among the three.\n(The agent is willing to bet that the winning horse is among the three.)\n2. M3.6 |=p B(h1 \u2228 h2) \u2227 B(h1 \u2228 h3) \u2227B(h2 \u2228 h3).\nThe agent believes the winning horse is among any two.\n(The agent is willing to bet that the winning horse is among any two.)\n3. M3.6 |=p Ba\u00ach1 \u2227 Ba\u00ach2 \u2227Ba\u00ach3.\nThe agent believes the winning horse is not any particular one.\n(The agent is willing to bet that the winning horse is not any particular one.)\n4. M3.6 |=p \u00acB(\u00ach1 \u2227 \u00ach2).\nThe agent does not believe that both horses 1 and 2 do not win.\n(The agent is not willing to bet that both horses 1 and 2 do not win.)\nIt follows from Items 3 and 4 of Example 3.6 that the present notion of belief is not closed under conjunction. This is discussed as part of the literature on the \u201cLottery Paradox\u201d [Kyb61].1 However, there is no reason in general that it is paradoxical to assign a conjunction \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8 a lower probability than either of its conjunctions. Indeed, if \u03d5 and \u03c8 are independent, then the probability of their conjunction equals the product of their probabilities, so unless one of \u03d5 or \u03c8 is certain or impossible, the probability of \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8 will be less than the probability of \u03d5 and less than the probability of \u03c8.\nWe set aside philosophical arguments for or against closure of belief under conjunction and instead turn our attention to the study of the properties of the present notion of belief. One of these is a complicated but useful property due to Scott [Sco64] that makes use of notation due to Segerberg [Seg71].\nDefinition 3.7 (Segerberg notation; [Seg71]). Fix a positive integerm \u2208 Z+ and formulas\u03d51, . . . , \u03d5m and \u03c81, . . . , \u03c8m. The expression\n(\u03d51, . . . , \u03d5mI\u03c81, . . . , \u03c8m) (3)\nabbreviates the formula K(F0 \u2228 F1 \u2228 F2 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 Fm) ,\nwhere Fi is the disjunction of all conjunctions\nd1\u03d51 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 dm\u03d5m \u2227 e1\u03c81 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 em\u03c8m\nsatisfying the property that exactly i of the dk\u2019s are the empty string, at least i of the ek\u2019s are the empty string, and the rest of the dk\u2019s and ek\u2019s are the negation sign \u00ac. We may write (\u03d5iI\u03c8i)mi=1 as an abbreviation for (3). Finally, let\n(\u03d5iE\u03c8i) m i=1 abbreviate (\u03d5iI\u03c8i) m i=1 \u2227 (\u03c8iI\u03d5i) m i=1 .\nWe also allow the use of E in a notation similar to (3).\nThe formula (\u03d5iI\u03c8i)mi=1 says that the agent knows that the number of true \u03d5i\u2019s is less than or equal to the number of true \u03c8i\u2019s. Put another way, (\u03d5iI\u03c8i)mi=1 is true if and only if every one of the agent\u2019s epistemically accessible worlds satisfies at least as many \u03c8i\u2019s as \u03d5i\u2019s. The formula (\u03d5iE\u03c8i)mi=1 says that every one of the agent\u2019s epistemically accessible worlds satisfies exactly as many \u03c8i\u2019s as \u03d5i\u2019s.\nDefinition 3.8 (Scott scheme; [Sco64]). We define the following scheme:\n[(\u03d5iI\u03c8i)mi=1 \u2227 B c\u03d51 \u2227 \u2227m i=2 B\u030c c\u03d5i] \u2192 \u2228m i=1B c\u03c8i (Scott)\nIf m = 1, then \u2227m\ni=2 B\u030c c\u03d5i is \u22a4. Note that (Scott) is meant to encompass the indicated scheme for\neach positive integer m \u2208 Z+.\n1The usual formulation of the Lottery Paradox: it is paradoxical for an agent to believe that one of n lottery tickets will be a winner (i.e., \u201csome ticket is a winner\u201d) without believing of any particular ticket that it is the winner (i.e., \u201cfor each i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, ticket i is not a winner\u201d).\n(Scott) says that if the agent knows the number of true \u03d5i\u2019s is less than or equal to the number of true \u03c8i\u2019s, she believes \u03d51 with threshold c, and the remaining \u03d5i\u2019s are each consistent with her threshold-c beliefs, then she believes one of the \u03c8i\u2019s with threshold c. Adapting a proof of Segerberg [Seg71], we show that belief with threshold c = 1\n2 satisfies (Scott).\nWe report this result along with a number of other properties in the following proposition.\nTheorem 3.9 (Properties of Belief). For c \u2208 (0, 1) \u2229Q, we have:\n1. 6|=p Bc(\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8) \u2192 (Bc\u03d5 \u2192 Bc\u03c8).\nBelief is not closed under logical consequence.\n(So Bc is not a normal modal operator.)\n2. 6|=p Bc\u03d5 \u2192 \u03d5.\nBelief is not veridical.\n3. |=p K\u03d5 \u2192 Bc\u03d5.\nWhat is known is believed.\n4. |=p \u00acBc\u22a5.\nThe propositional constant \u22a5 for falsehood is not believed.\n5. |=p Bc\u22a4.\nThe propositional constant \u22a4 for truth is believed.\n6. |=p Bc\u03d5 \u2192 KBc\u03d5.\nWhat is believed is known to be believed.\n7. |=p \u00acBc\u03d5 \u2192 K\u00acBc\u03d5.\nWhat is not believed is known to be not believed.\n8. |=p K(\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8) \u2192 (Bc\u03d5 \u2192 Bc\u03c8).\nBelief is closed under known logical consequence.\n9. If c \u2208 [1 2 , 1), then |=p Bc\u03d5 \u2192 B\u030cc\u03d5.\nHigh-threshold belief is consistent: belief in \u03d5 implies disbelief in \u00ac\u03d5.\n10. |=p B\u030c 1 2\u03d5 \u2227 K\u030c(\u00ac\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8) \u2192 B 1 2 (\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8).\nFor mid-threshold belief, if \u03d5 is consistent with the agent\u2019s beliefs and \u00ac\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8 is consistent with her knowledge, then she believes \u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8.\n11. |=p [(\u03d5iI\u03c8i)mi=1 \u2227 B 1 2\u03d51 \u2227 \u2227m i=2 B\u030c 1 2\u03d5i] \u2192 \u2228m i=1B 1 2\u03c8i.\nMid-threshold belief satisfies (Scott).\nProof. We consider each item in turn.\n1. Given c \u2208 (0, 1)\u2229Q and integers p and q such that p/q = c, we define M as the modification of the model M3.6 of Example 3.6 obtained by changing P as follows:\nP :=\n{\nw1 : q \u2212 p\n2q , w2 :\np q , w3 : q \u2212 p 2q\n}\n.\nSince 0 < p < q, it follows that\nPw1(J\u00ach1 \u2192 h2Kp) = Pw1({w1, w2}) = q + p\n2q >\n2p 2q = p q ,\nPw1(J\u00ach1Kp) = Pw1({w2, w3}) = q + p\n2q >\n2p 2q = p q , and\nPw1(Jh2Kp) = Pw1(w2) = p\nq .\nTherefore, we have\nM, w1 |=p B c(\u00ach1 \u2192 h2) \u2227B c\u00ach1 \u2227 \u00acB ch2 .\n2. For M defined in the proof of Item 1, we have\nM, w1 |=p h1 \u2227B c\u00ach1 .\n3. M, w |=p K\u03d5 implies Pw(J\u03d5Kp) = 1 > c. Hence M, w |=p Bc\u03d5.\n4. Pw(J\u22a5Kp) = 0 < c. Hence M, w |= \u00acBc\u22a5.\n5. Pw(J\u22a4Kp) = 1 > c. Hence M, w |=p Bc\u22a4.\n6. M, w |=p Bc\u03d5 implies Pw(J\u03d5Kp) > c. To show that M, w |=p KBc\u03d5, we must prove that\nPw(JB c\u03d5Kp) =\nP (JBc\u03d5Kp \u2229 [w])\nP ([w]) = 1 .\nTo show this, we prove that JBc\u03d5Kp \u2229 [w] = [w]. So choose u \u2208 [w]. Since R is an equivalence relation, we have\nPu(J\u03d5Kp) = P (J\u03d5Kp \u2229 [u])\nP ([u]) =\nP (J\u03d5Kp \u2229 [w])\nP ([w]) = Pw(J\u03d5Kp) > c ,\nwhich implies u \u2208 JBc\u03d5Kp. The result follows.\n7. The argument is similar to that for Item 6, though we note that M, w |=p \u00acBc\u03d5 implies Pw(J\u03d5Kp) \u2264 c.\n8. We assume that M, w |=p K(\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8) and M, w |=p Bc\u03d5. This means thatPw(J\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8Kp) = 1 and Pw(J\u03d5Kp) > c. But then it follows that Pw(J\u03c8Kp) > c as well, which is what it means to have M, w |=p Bc\u03c8.\n9. Assume c \u2208 [1 2 , 1)\u2229Q and M, w |=p Bc\u03d5. Then Pw(J\u03d5Kp) > c \u2265 1\u2212c. So Pw(J\u03d5Kp) \u2265 1\u2212c.\nThe result therefore follows by Lemma 3.5.\n10. We prove something more general. Assume c \u2208 (0, 1 2 ] \u2229 Q and M, w |=p B\u030cc\u03d5. By\nLemma 3.5, it follows that Pw(J\u03d5Kp) \u2265 c. Let us assume further that M, w |=p K\u030c(\u00ac\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8). This means\n1 6= Pw(J\u00ac(\u00ac\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8)Kp) = P (J\u00ac(\u00ac\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8)Kp \u2229 [w])\nP ([w]) ,\nwhich implies there exists v \u2208 J\u00ac\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8Kp \u2229 [w]. Since P (v) > 0 by full support, it follows that\nPw(J\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8Kp) = P (J\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8Kp \u2229 [w])\nP ([w])\n= P (J\u03d5Kp \u2229 [w])\nP ([w]) +\nP (J\u00ac\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8Kp \u2229 [w])\nP ([w])\n\u2265 P (J\u03d5Kp \u2229 [w])\nP ([w]) +\nP (v)\nP ([w])\n= Pw(J\u03d5Kp) + P (v)\nP ([w])\n\u2265 c+ P (v)\nP ([w]) > c .\nThat is, M, w |=p Bc(\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8).\n11. Again, we prove something more general. We assume c \u2208 (0, 1 2 ] \u2229Q plus the following:\nM, w |=p (\u03d5iI\u03c8i) m i=1 (4) M, w |=p B c\u03d51 (5) M, w |=p \u2227m i=2 B\u030c c\u03d5i (6)\nWe recall the meaning of (4): for each v \u2208 [w], the number of \u03d5i\u2019s true at v is less than or equal to the number of \u03c8k\u2019s true at v. It therefore follows from (4) that\nPw(J\u03d51Kp) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ Pw(J\u03d5mKp) \u2264 Pw(J\u03c81Kp) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ Pw(J\u03c8mKp) . (7)\nOutlining an argument due to Segerberg [Seg71, pp. 344\u2013346], the reason for this is as follows: we think of each world v \u2208 [w] as being assigned a \u201cweight\u201d Pw(v). A member Pw(J\u03d5iKp) of the sum on the left of (7) is just a total of the weight of every v \u2208 [w] that satisfies \u03d5i; that is,\nPw(J\u03d5iKp) = \u2211 {Pw(v) | v \u2208 J\u03d5iKp \u2229 [w]} .\nAssumption (4) tells us that for each v \u2208 [w], the number of totals Pw(J\u03d5iKp) on the left of (7) to which v contributes its weight is less than or equal to the number of totals Pw(J\u03c8kKp) on the right of (7) to which v contributes its weight. But then the sum of totals on the left must be less than or equal to the sum of totals on the right. Hence (7) follows.\nHaving established (7), we now proceed further with the overall proof. By (5), we have Pw(J\u03d51Kp) > c. Applying (6) and Lemma 3.5, we have Pw(\u03d5i) \u2265 c for each i \u2208 {2, . . . , m}. Hence\nPw(J\u03c81Kp) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ Pw(J\u03c8mKp) \u2265 Pw(J\u03d51Kp) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ Pw(J\u03d5mKp) > mc .\nThat is, the sum of the Pw(J\u03c8kKp)\u2019s must exceed mc. Since each member of this m-member sum is non-negative, it follows that at least one member must exceed c. That is, there exists j \u2208 {1, . . . , m} such that Pw(J\u03c8jKp) > c. Hence M, w |=p \u2228m j=1B c\u03c8j ."}, {"heading": "4 Epistemic Neighborhood Models", "text": "The modal formulas K\u03d5 and Bc\u03d5 were taken as abbreviations in the language L of probability logic. We wish to consider a propositional modal language that has knowledge and belief operators as primitives.\nDefinition 4.1. The language LKB of (single-agent) knowledge and belief is defined by the following grammar.\n\u03d5 ::= \u22a4 | p | \u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2227 \u03d5 | K\u03d5 | B\u03d5\np \u2208 P\nWe adopt the usual abbreviations for other Boolean connectives and define the dual operators K\u030c := \u00acK\u00ac and B\u030c := \u00acB\u00ac.

An epistemic neighborhood model is a structure\nM = (W,R, V,N)\nsatisfying the following.\n\u2022 (W,R, V ) is a finite single-agent S5 Kripke model (as in Definition 2.1).

Intuitively, [w] is the set of worlds the agent knows to be possible at w and each X \u2208 N(w) represents a proposition that the agent believes at w. The condition that R be an equivalence relation ensures that knowledge is closed under logical consequence, veridical (i.e., only true things can be known), positive introspective (i.e., the agent knows what she knows), and negative introspective (i.e., the agent knows what she does not know).\nProperty (kbc) ensures that the agent does not believe a proposition X \u2286 W that she knows to be false: if X contains a world in w\u2032 \u2208 (W \u2212 [w]) that the agent knows is not possible with respect to the actual world w, then she knows that X cannot be the case and hence she does not believe X . Property (kbf) ensures that no logical falsehood is believed, while Property (n) ensures that every logical truth is believed. Property (a) ensures that X is believed if and only if it is known that X is believed.

For a threshold c \u2208 (0, 1) \u2229 Q, to say that a probability measure P : \u2118(W ) \u2192 [0, 1] agrees with M for threshold c means we have the following:\n\u2022 P satisfies full support (i.e., P (w) 6= 0 for each w \u2208 W ); and\n\u2022 for each w \u2208 W and X \u2286 [w], we have\nX \u2208 N(w) iff Pw(X) := P (X|[w]) > c .\nTo say that an epistemic probability model M\u2032 = (W \u2032, R\u2032, V \u2032, P \u2032) agrees with M for threshold c means that (W \u2032, R\u2032, V \u2032) = (W,R, V ) and P \u2032 agrees with M for threshold c. If the threshold c is not mentioned, it is assumed that c = 1\n2 .\nAgreement for threshold c between an epistemic neighborhood model and an epistemic probability model makes the translation c : LKB \u2192 L (Definition 4.2) truth-preserving.\nTheorem 4.6 (Agreement). Fix c \u2208 (0, 1) \u2229 Q, an epistemic neighborhood model M, and an epistemic probability model M\u2032. If M and M\u2032 agree for threshold c, then we have for each \u03d5 \u2208 LKB that\nM, w |=n \u03d5 iff M \u2032, w |=p \u03d5 c .\nProof. Induction on the structure of \u03d5 \u2208 LKB. The non-modal cases are obvious. We first consider knowledge formulas. Assume M, w |=n K\u03c8. This means [w] \u2286 J\u03c8KMn . Applying the induction hypothesis, this is equivalent to [w] \u2286 J\u03c8cKM \u2032\np . By full support, the latter holds if and only if\nPw(J\u03c8 cKM\n\u2032 p ) = P (J\u03c8cKM\n\u2032\np \u2229 [w])\nP ([w]) = 1 ,\nwhich is what it means to have M\u2032, w |=p P (\u03c8c) = 1. Since P (\u03c8c) = 1 is what is abbreviated by (K\u03c8)c, the result follows.\nNow we move to belief formulas. Assume M, w |=n B\u03c8. This means that [w]\u2229J\u03c8KMn \u2208 N(w). Since M\u2032 agrees with M, the latter holds iff Pw([w] \u2229 J\u03c8cKM \u2032\np ) > c. But this is equivalent to Pw(J\u03c8 cKM \u2032 p ) > c, which is what it means to have M \u2032, w |=p P (\u03c8c) > c. Since P (\u03c8c) > c is what is abbreviated by (B\u03c8)c, the result follows."}, {"heading": "4.2 Probability Measures on Epistemic Neighborhood Models", "text": "In this subsection, we take up the question of agreement between epistemic probability models and epistemic neighborhood models from the point of view of the latter: given an epistemic neighborhood model and a threshold c, can we find an agreeing epistemic probability model for this threshold? As we will see, we have a full answer only for the case c = 1\n2 . The case for c 6= 1 2 is\nopen, though we will have some comments on this in the conclusion of the paper. To begin, we adapt an example due to Walley and Fine [WF79] to show that not every epistemic neighborhood model gives rise to an agreeing probability measure.\nTheorem 4.7 ([WF79]). There exists an epistemic neighborhood model M that has no agreeing probability measure for any threshold c \u2208 (0, 1) \u2229Q.\nProof. We adapt Example 2 from [WF79, pp. 344-345] to the present setting. Fix c \u2208 (0, 1) \u2229 Q. Let P := {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}. Define:\nX := {efg, abg, adf, bde, ace, cdg, bcf} ,\nY := {abcd, cdef, bceg, acfg, bdfg, abef, adeg} .\nNotation: in the above sets, xyz denotes {x, y, z}, and wxyz denotes {w, x, y, z}. Now define\nN := {X \u2032 | \u2203X \u2208 X : X \u2286 X \u2032 \u2286 P} .\nLet M := (W,R, V,N) be defined by W := P, R := W \u00d7W , V (w) := {w} for each w \u2208 P, and N(w) := N for each w \u2208 W . It is straightforward to verify that M is an epistemic neighborhood model and that Y \u2229 N = \u2205.\nToward a contradiction, suppose there exists a probability measure P that agrees with M. Since each letter p \u2208 W occurs in exactly three of the seven members of X , we have:\n\u2211\nX\u2208X\nP (X) = \u2211\np\u2208W\n3 \u00b7 P ({p}) .\nSince each letter p \u2208 W occurs in exactly four of the seven members of Y , we have:\n\u2211\nY \u2208Y\nP (Y ) = \u2211\np\u2208W\n4 \u00b7 P ({p}) > \u2211\nX\u2208X\nP (X) .\nOn the other hand, since Y \u2229 N = \u2205, no member of Y is a neighborhood of M and therefore it follows by the agreement of P with M that we have P (Y ) \u2264 c < P (X) for each Y \u2208 Y and X \u2208 X . But then \u2211\nY \u2208Y\nP (Y ) < \u2211\nX\u2208X\nP (X) ,\nand we have reached a contradiction. Conclusion: no such P exists.\nQuestion: what are the additional restrictions on the neighborhood function that one must impose in order to guarantee the existence of an agreeing probability measure for a given threshold c \u2208 (0, 1) \u2229Q? For c = 1\n2 , the restrictions are known. For thresholds c 6= 1 2 , the question is open.\nThe restrictions needed for c = 1 2 were studied first in the form of a purely probabilistic semantics (i.e., something like epistemic probability models and not something like our epistemic neighborhood models). To our knowledge, Lenzen\u2019s [Len80] is the first complete study of the restrictions needed in such a purely probabilistic framework over a unary modal language similar to LKB. The conditions Lenzen proposed are targeted to satisfy the conditions of a theorem due to Scott, which is the key result that gives rise to a probability measure in the completeness proof for Lenzen\u2019s logic. Here we state the required restrictions in the language of our epistemic neighborhood models. Later we will make the link with Lenzen\u2019s axiomatic system when we consider axiomatic theories in the language LKB targeted to our epistemic neighborhood models.\nDefinition 4.8 (Extra Properties for \u201cMid-Threshold\u201d Models). Let M = (W,R, V,N) be an epistemic neighborhood model. For m \u2208 Z+ and sets of worlds X1, . . . , Xm and Y1, . . . , Ym, we write\nX1, . . . , XmIY1, . . . , Ym (8)\nto mean that for each v \u2208 W , the number of Xi\u2019s containing v is less than or equal to the number of Yi\u2019s containing v. This is the semantic counterpart of the formula from Definition 3.7. We may write (XiIYi)mi=1 as an abbreviation for (8). Also, we write (XiEYi) m i=1 to mean that both (XiIYi)mi=1 and (YiIXi) m i=1 hold, and we allow the notation with E to be used in a form as in (8). The following is a list of properties that M may satisfy.\n(d) \u2200X \u2208 N(w) : [w]\u2212X /\u2208 N(w).\n(sc) \u2200X, Y \u2286 [w]: if [w]\u2212X /\u2208 N(w) and X ( Y , then Y \u2208 N(w).\n(scott) \u2200m \u2208 Z+, \u2200X1, . . . , Xm, Y1, . . . , Ym \u2286 [w] :\nif X1, . . . , XmIY1, . . . , Ym and\nX1 \u2208 N(w) and\n\u2200i \u2208 {2, . . . , m} : [w]\u2212Xi /\u2208 N(w) ,\nthen \u2203j \u2208 {1, . . . , m} : Yj \u2208 N(w) .\nTo say an epistemic neighborhood model is mid-threshold means it satisfies (d), (sc), and (scott). We may drop the word \u201cepistemic\u201d in referring to mid-threshold epistemic neighborhood models. Pointed versions of mid-threshold neighborhood models are defined in the obvious way.\nProperty (d) ensures that beliefs are consistent in the sense that the agent does not believe both X and its complement [w]\u2212X . Property (sc) is a form of \u201cstrong commitment\u201d: if the agent does not believe the complement [w] \u2212 X , then she must believe any strictly weaker Y implied by X . Property (scott) is a version of the syntactic scheme (Scott) from Definition 3.8.\nLet us return to the model M from the proof of Theorem 5.5. It is easy to see that for no Xi \u2208 X do we have W \u2212Xi \u2208 N(a) = N . So, numbering the members of X as X1, . . . , X7 and the members of Y as Y1, . . . , Y7, we see that M satisfies\n(XiIYi) 7 i=1, X1 \u2208 N(a), and \u2200i \u2208 {2, . . . , 7} : W \u2212Xi /\u2208 N(a) ,\nwhich is the antecedent of property (scott) from Definition 4.8. However, M does not satisfy\n\u2203j \u2208 {1, . . . , 7} : Yj \u2208 N(a) ,\nwhich is the corresponding consequent of the indicated instance of (scott). So we see that if we were to restrict ourselves to the class of epistemic neighborhood models satisfying this property, we would no longer be able to use M as a counterexample to the claim that not every epistemic neighborhood model gives rise to an agreeing probability measure. Of course ruling out M as a counterexample to this claim does not prove the claim. However, utilizing (scott) in conjunction with (d) and (sc), we are able to prove the claim. This proof makes crucial use of a theorem due to Scott that is closely related to [Sco64, Theorem 4.1].\nIn preparation for the statement of Scott\u2019s theorem, we recall some well-known notions from linear algebra. For a nonempty set S, let L(S) denote the S-dimensional real vector space whose vectors consist of functions x : S \u2192 R and whose operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication are defined coordinate-wise: given vectors x, y : S \u2192 R and a scalar real r \u2208 R, the vector (x+ y) : S \u2192 R is defined by (x+ y)(s) := x(s) + y(s) for each coordinate s \u2208 S and the vector (r \u00b7x) : S \u2192 R is defined by (r \u00b7x)(s) := r \u00b7x(s) for each coordinate s \u2208 S. Note that we have just used the usual notational overloading wherein the + or \u00b7 symbol on one side of an equation refers to the vector operation, and yet the same symbol on the other side of the same equation refers to the operation in R. Other common notational abbreviations such as omission of \u00b7\u2019s and writing \u2212x for (\u22121) \u00b7x will be used. To say that a vector x : S \u2192 R is rational means that all of its coordinates (i.e., values) are rational numbers. To say a set X \u2286 L(S) of vectors is rational means that every\nvector in X is rational, and to say that X is symmetric means that X = \u2212X := {\u2212x | x \u2208 X}. A linear functional on L(S) is a function f : L(S) \u2192 R satisfying the following property of linearity: for each r1, r2 \u2208 R and x, y \u2208 L(S), we have f(r1x+ r2y) = r1 \u00b7 f(x) + r2 \u00b7 f(y).\nTheorem 4.9 ([Sco64, Theorem 1.2]). Let S be a finite nonempty set and X be a finite, rational, symmetric subset of L(S). For each N \u2286 X , there exists a linear functional f on L(S) that realizes N , meaning\nN = {x \u2208 X | f(x) \u2265 0} ,\nif and only if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\u2022 for each x \u2208 X , we have x \u2208 N or \u2212x \u2208 N ; and\n\u2022 for each integer n \u2265 0 and x0, . . . , xn \u2208 N , we have\nn\u2211\ni=0\nxi = 0 \u21d2 \u2212x0 \u2208 N .\nWe use this theorem to show that mid-threshold models always give rise to an agreeing probability measure. That is, the neighborhood function of mid-threshold models picks out exactly those neighborhoods that may be assigned a probability exceeding 1\n2 . Many of the key ideas of the proof\nof the following result are due to Lenzen [Len80]. However, the argument we present here has been rewritten in a streamlined, modern form and in the language of our epistemic neighborhood models. Despite this difference (and the necessary work we had to undertake to translate these results into this modern form), we are happy to credit Professor Lenzen for the following result.\nTheorem 4.10 ([Len80]). Let M = (W,R, V,N) be a mid-threshold epistemic neighborhood model. There exists a probability measure P : \u2118(W ) \u2192 [0, 1] agreeing with M for threshold 1\n2 ;\nthat is,\n\u2022 P satisfies full support (i.e., P (w) 6= 0 for each w \u2208 W ); and\n\u2022 for each w \u2208 W and X \u2286 [w], we have\nX \u2208 N(w) iff Pw(X) := P (X|[w]) > 12 .\nProof. We credit Lenzen [Len80] for this proof, though we herein provide an original reformulation of his work within the setting of the epistemic neighborhood models introduced in this paper. Proceeding, for w \u2208 W , define Sw := [w]. For each X \u2286 Sw, define the relative complement X \u2032 := Sw \u2212X and let \u03b9(X) : Sw \u2192 {0, 1} be the characteristic function of X:\n\u03b9(X)(s) :=\n{\n1 if s \u2208 X,\n0 otherwise.\nWe consider the following finite subsets of L(Sw):\nAw := {\u03b9(X) | X \u2286 Sw} , Bw := {\u03b9(X)\u2212 \u03b9(X \u2032) | X \u2286 Sw & X \u2032 /\u2208 N(w)} ,\nNw := Aw \u222a Bw ,\nXw := Nw \u222a (\u2212Nw) .\nIt is easy to see that Nw \u2286 Xw and that Xw is a finite, rational, and symmetric subset of L(Sw). We wish to show that Nw and Xw satisfy the conditions of Theorem 4.9. First, we note that x \u2208 Xw implies x \u2208 Nw or \u2212x \u2208 Nw by the definition of Xw.\nFor the second condition of Theorem 4.9, suppose we are given an integer n \u2265 0 such that x0, . . . , xn \u2208 Nw and \u2211n i=0 xi = 0. We wish to show that \u2212x0 \u2208 Nw. Proceeding, there exists an integer \u2113 satisfying:\n0 \u2264 i \u2264 \u2113 implies xi = \u03b9(Xi)\u2212 \u03b9(X \u2032 i) \u2208 Bw , and \u2113 < i \u2264 n implies xi = \u03b9(Xi) \u2208 Aw .\nToward a contradiction, assume there exists i > \u2113 with xi 6= 0. Then for x\u2217 := \u2211n\ni=\u2113+1 xi, we have x\u2217(s) \u2265 0 for all s \u2208 Sw, and there exists s\u2217 \u2208 Sw with x\u2217(s\u2217) > 0. Hence\n\u2211\u2113 i=0 xi = \u2211\u2113 i=0 ( \u03b9(Xi)\u2212 \u03b9(X \u2032i) ) = \u2212x\u2217 ,\nwhere \u2212x\u2217(s\u2217) < 0 and \u2212x\u2217(s) \u2264 0 for all s \u2208 Sw. So for each s \u2208 Sw, the number of the sets in the list X \u20320, . . . , X \u2032 \u2113 containing s is greater than or equal to the number of the sets in the list X0, . . . , X\u2113 containing s. Further, s\u2217 is a member of strictly more sets in the former list than those in the latter. By renumbering, we may assume that s\u2217 \u2208 X \u20320 \u2212X0. Then we have\nX0 \u222a {s \u2217}, X1, . . . , X\u2113IX \u2032 0, X \u2032 1, . . . , X \u2032 \u2113 .\nSince X \u20320, . . . , X \u2032 \u2113 /\u2208 N(w), it follows by (scott) that X0 \u222a {s \u2217} /\u2208 N(w). But X0 ( X0 \u222a {s\u2217} /\u2208 N(w) and X \u20320 /\u2208 N(w), which violates (sc). Conclusion: i > \u2113 implies xi = 0. But then we have\u2211n\ni=0 xi = \u2211\u2113 i=0 xi. Since xi = \u03b9(Xi)\u2212 \u03b9(X \u2032 i) for i \u2264 \u2113, it follows that \u2211\u2113 i=0 \u03b9(Xi) = \u2211\u2113 i=0 \u03b9(X \u2032 i).\nBut the latter is what it means to have (XiEX \u2032i) \u2113 i=0. Since X \u2032 i /\u2208 N(w) for i \u2264 \u2113 by the definition of Bw, it follows by (scott) that X0 /\u2208 N(w). But then \u03b9(X \u20320)\u2212 \u03b9(X0) = \u2212x0 \u2208 Bw \u2286 Nw, as desired. So we may apply Theorem 4.9: there exists a linear functional fw on L(Sw) that realizes Nw. That is, Nw = {x \u2208 Xw | fw(x) \u2265 0} .\nDefine gw : \u2118(Sw) \u2192 R by the composition gw(X) := fw(\u03b9(X)). This function satisfies a few important properties.\n1. X \u2208 N(w) iff gw(X) > gw(X \u2032).\nSuppose X \u2208 N(w). Then X \u2032 /\u2208 N(w) by (d). Hence \u03b9(X)\u2212\u03b9(X \u2032) \u2208 Bw and \u03b9(X \u2032)\u2212\u03b9(X) /\u2208 Bw. Since Sw \u2208 N(w) by (n), it follows that X 6= \u2205 = S \u2032w. But then the coordinates of\n\u03b9(X \u2032)\u2212 \u03b9(X) contain at least one 1 and at least one \u22121. Since every x \u2208 Aw has coordinates that are 1\u2019s or 0\u2019s only, it follows that \u03b9(X \u2032)\u2212 \u03b9(X) /\u2208 Nw. As \u03b9(X)\u2212 \u03b9(X \u2032) \u2208 Bw \u2286 Nw and fw is linear and realizes Nw, it follows that gw(X) \u2265 gw(X \u2032) and gw(X \u2032) gw(X). That is, gw(X) > gw(X \u2032).\nConversely, suppose gw(X) > gw(X \u2032). Since fw is linear and realizes Nw, it follows that \u03b9(X \u2032)\u2212 \u03b9(X) /\u2208 Nw \u2287 Bw. Applying the definition of Bw, we have X \u2208 N(w).\n2. gw(Sw) > gw(\u2205) = 0.\nWe have gw(\u2205) = fw(0) = 0 by the linearity of fw. Since Sw \u2208 N(w) by (n), it follows that gw(Sw) > gw(\u2205) by property 1.\n3. If 0 \u2264 gw(X) \u2264 gw(Sw).\nSince \u03b9(X) \u2208 Aw \u2286 Nw and fw realizes Nw, we have gw(X) \u2265 0. So each X \u2286 Sw satisfies gw(X) \u2265 0. From this it follows by the linearity of fw that for each X \u2286 Sw, we have\ngw(X) = \u2211 v\u2208X gw({v}) \u2264 \u2211 v\u2208Sw gw({v}) = gw(Sw) .\n4. If X, Y \u2286 Sw and X \u2229 Y = \u2205, then gw(X \u222a Y ) = gw(X) + gw(Y ).\nBy the linearity of fw.\n5. \u2205 6= X \u2286 Sw implies gw(X) > 0.\nSuppose \u2205 6= X \u2286 Sw. By property 2, it suffices to prove the result for X 6= Sw. Toward a contradiction, assume gw(X) = 0 for \u2205 ( X ( Sw. By property 4, we have gw(Sw) = gw(X) + gw(X \u2032) = gw(X \u2032). Since fw is linear and realizes Nw and\n\u03b9(X \u2032)\u2212 \u03b9(Sw) = \u2212(\u03b9(Sw)\u2212 \u03b9(X \u2032)) = \u2212\u03b9(X) \u2208 Xw ,\nwe obtain \u2212\u03b9(X) \u2208 Nw. But \u2205 ( X ( Sw implies that \u2212\u03b9(X) has coordinates containing at least one \u22121 and at least one 0. Since members of Aw have coordinates made up of 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s, members of Bw have coordinates made up of \u22121\u2019s and 1\u2019s, and Nw = Aw \u222a Bw, it cannot be the case that \u2212\u03b9(X) \u2208 Nw. Contradiction. Conclusion: gw(X) > 0.\nNow take v \u2208 [w]. Since N(v) = N(w) by (a), it follows that gw also realizes Nv. So, letting [W ] be the set {[w] | w \u2208 W} of equivalence classes, let h : [W ] \u2192 W be a choice function that selects for each class [w] \u2208 [W ] a representative h([w]) \u2208 [w]. Using a notational overloading that ought to be harmless, we define a new function hw : \u2118([w]) \u2192 R by setting hw(X) := gh([w])(X). Obviously, v \u2208 [w] implies hv = hw. Finally, we define P : \u2118(W ) \u2192 [0, 1] by\nP (X) := \u2211\n[w]\u2208[W ]\nhw(X \u2229 [w])\nhw([w]) .\nNote that by property 2, the denominator hw([w]) is always nonzero.\nWe prove that P is a probability measure on \u2118(W ) satisfying full support. First, P satisfies the Kolmogorov axioms over the finite algebra \u2118(W ): we have P (X) \u2265 0 by property 3, P (W ) = 1 by property 2 and the definition of P , and P (X \u222a Y ) = P (X) + P (Y ) for disjoint X and Y by property 4 and the definition of P . Second, full support follows by property 5.\nFinally, for X \u2286 [w], we have by property 1 that X \u2208 N(w) iff hw(X) > hw(X \u2032). But the latter holds iff we have (making use of property 4) that\n2 \u00b7 hw(X) > hw(X) + hw(X \u2032) = hw([w]) .\nBy property 2, the definition of P , and the fact that X \u2286 [w], the above inequality holds iff\nP (X) = hw(X)\nhw([w]) > 1 2 .\nCorollary 4.11. Let M = (W,R, V,N) be a mid-threshold epistemic neighborhood model. There exists an epistemic probability model N = (W,R, V, P ) that agrees with M for threshold 1\n2 .\nProof. Let P be the measure given by Theorem 4.10."}, {"heading": "4.3 Epistemic Neighborhood Models from Probability Measures", "text": "In the last subsection, we investigated the question of whether an epistemic neighborhood model gives rise to an agreeing epistemic probability model.

Fix c \u2208 (0, 1) \u2229Q. If M is an epistemic probability model, then Mc is an epistemic neighborhood model. Furthermore, M 1 2 is a mid-threshold neighborhood model.\nProof. We verify that N c satisfies the required properties.\n\u2022 For (kbc), X \u2208 N c(w) implies X \u2286 [w] by definition.\n\u2022 For (kbf), Pw(\u2205) = 0 < c, so \u2205 /\u2208 N c(w).\n\u2022 For (n), Pw([w]) = 1 > c, so [w] \u2208 N c(w).\n\u2022 For (a), suppose X \u2208 N c(w) and v \u2208 [w]. Then Pw(X) > c. Since v \u2208 [w] implies [w] = [v], we have\nPw(X) = P (X \u2229 [w])\nP ([w]) =\nP (X \u2229 [v])\nP ([v]) = Pv(X) .\nHence Pv(X) > c, so X \u2208 N c(v).\n\u2022 For (kbm), suppose X \u2208 N c(w). Then Pw(X) > c. Hence if Y satisfies X \u2286 Y \u2286 [w], we have Pw(Y ) > c and so Y \u2208 N c(w).\nSo Mc is an epistemic neighborhood model. We now show that M 1\n2 satisfies the additional required properties.\n\u2022 For (d), assume c \u2208 [1 2 , 1) \u2229 Q and X \u2208 N c(w). Then Pw(X) > c, and therefore Pw([w]\u2212\nX) \u2264 1\u2212 c \u2264 c. Hence [w]\u2212X /\u2208 N c(w).\n\u2022 For (sc), assume X \u2032 := [\u0393] \u2212 X /\u2208 N 1\n2 (w) and X ( Y \u2286 [\u0393]. From the first assumption, we have Pw(X \u2032) \u2264 12 , and therefore that Pw(X) \u2265 1 2 . Applying the second assumption, Pw(Y ) > Pw(X) \u2265 1 2 , and hence X \u2208 N 1 2 (w).\n\u2022 For (scott), we assume c \u2208 (0, 1 2 ] \u2229Q along with the following:\n(XiIYi) m i=1 (9) X1 \u2208 N c(w) (10) \u2200i \u2208 {2, . . . , m} : [\u0393]\u2212Xi /\u2208 N c(w) (11)\nFrom (9) it follows that\nPw(X1) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ Pw(Xm) \u2264 Pw(Y1) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ Pw(Ym) (12)\nThe argument for this is similar to an argument for (7) in proof of Theorem 3.9(11). From (10), we have Pw(X1) > c. From (11), we have for each i \u2208 {2, . . . , m} that Pw([w]\u2212Xi) \u2264 c and therefore that Pw(Xi) \u2265 1 \u2212 c \u2265 c since c \u2208 (0, 12 ] \u2229 Q. Hence the left side of (12) exceeds mc. Since every summand on the right side of the inequality is positive and mc > 0, it follows that at least one member of the right side of (12) must exceed c. That is, there exists j \u2208 {1, . . . , m} such that Pw(Yj) > c and hence Yj \u2208 N c(w).\nTheorem 4.14. Let c \u2208 (0, 1)\u2229Q and M = (W,R, V, P ) be an epistemic probability model. The epistemic neighborhood model Mc = (W,R, V,N c) agrees with M for threshold c.\nProof. By definition of N c."}, {"heading": "5 Calculi for Belief as Willingness to Bet", "text": "We now consider an axiomatic link both with epistemic neighborhood models and with epistemic probability models. We study two calculi: the calculus KB of epistemic neighborhood models, and the calculus KB.5 of mid-threshold neighborhood models. Regarding the probability interpretation, KB is sound for every threshold but not complete for any threshold. KB.5 is both sound and complete for the probability interpretation with threshold c = 1\n2 .\nKB.5 is our modern reformulation of Lenzen\u2019s [Len80] calculus for the logic of knowledge (i.e., Lenzen\u2019s \u201cacceptance\u201d) as probabilistic certainty and belief as probability exceeding threshold 1\n2 . Lenzen\u2019s intended semantic structures are something like epistemic probability models. Our intended semantic structures are our mid-threshold neighborhood models, though there is a natural link with epistemic probability models via Theorem 4.10. In fact, many of the main ideas of our proof of Theorem 4.10 are not doubt translations of Lenzen\u2019s ideas into the language of our epistemic neighborhood models. Since we have rewritten all proofs using our own approach and modern modal notions, it is difficult to determine whether we have introduced novel mathematical results on top of Lenzen\u2019s existing work, though we suspect that anything new we may have added along these lines (excluding of course epistemic neighborhood models themselves and all related results except Theorem 4.10) may be slight at best. Therefore, we are happy to credit Professor Lenzen for the probabilistic soundness and completeness of KB.5 and for Theorem 4.10. Nevertheless, we do think that it is worth our effort to provide this modern reformulation of his results. In particular, we believe that in using semantic structures more familiar to the modern modal logician, our modern reformulation of Lenzen\u2019s results will make the mathematical details of Lenzen\u2019s work more accessible to a modern English-language audience. We also hope that our use of the modal neighborhood structures will suggest directions for further study of qualitative probability via tools from modal logic.\nDefinition 5.1.

We reason in KB. For 1, we have K\u03d5 \u2192 K(\u22a4 \u2192 \u03d5) by elementary modal reasoning. But then from this, B\u22a4 by (N), and K(\u22a4 \u2192 \u03d5) \u2192 (B\u22a4 \u2192 B\u03d5) by (KBM), it follows by classical reasoning that we have K\u03d5 \u2192 B\u03d5.\nFor 2, we derive K((\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8) \u2192 \u03d5) \u2192 (B(\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8) \u2192 B\u03d5) (13)\nby (KBM), and the antecedent of (13) by (CL) and (MN). Therefore, the consequent of (13) is derivable by (MN). By a similar argument, B(\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8) \u2192 B\u03c8 is derivable. By classical reasoning, 2 is derivable.\nFor 3, we derive\nK\u03d5 \u2192 K(\u03c8 \u2192 (\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8)) and (14)\nK(\u03c8 \u2192 (\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8)) \u2192 (B\u03c8 \u2192 B(\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8)) . (15)\n(14) follows by S5 reasoning. (15) follows by (KBM). Applying classical reasoning to (14) and (15), we obtain\nK\u03d5 \u2192 (B\u03c8 \u2192 B(\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8)) ,\nfrom which 3 follows by classical reasoning. For 4, we derive\nK(\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8) \u2192 K(\u00ac\u03c8 \u2192 \u00ac\u03d5) and (16)\nK(\u00ac\u03c8 \u2192 \u00ac\u03d5) \u2192 (B\u00ac\u03c8 \u2192 B\u00ac\u03d5) . (17)\n(16) follows by S5 reasoning. (17) follows by (KBM). Applying classical reasoning to (16) and (17), we obtain\nK(\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8) \u2192 (B\u00ac\u03c8 \u2192 B\u00ac\u03d5) ,\nfrom which 4 follows by classical reasoning (just contrapose the consequent). 5 follows by (Ap) and 1. 6 follows by (An) and 1. 7 follows by by (Ap) for the right-to-left and (KS5) for the left-to-right. 8 follows by (An) for the right-to-left and (KS5) for the left-to-right. 9 follows by (MN) and 1. 10 follows by (MN) and (KBM). 11 follows by contraposition, (MN), (KBM), and contraposition. 12 follows from 10 by classical reasoning.\nFor 13, we have K(\u03d5 \u2192 \u22a5) \u2192 (B\u03d5 \u2192 B\u22a5) (18)\nby (KBM). Therefore, if \u03d5 \u2192 \u22a5 is provable, it follows by (MN) that the antecedent of (18) is as well. By (MP), the consequent B\u03d5 \u2192 B\u22a5 is provable. Applying (BF) and classical reasoning, it follows by contraposition that \u00acB\u03d5 is provable.\nTheorem 5.3 (KB Neighborhood Soundness and Completeness). KB is sound and complete with respect to the class C of epistemic neighborhood models:\n\u2200\u03d5 \u2208 LKB : KB \u22a2 \u03d5 \u21d4 C |=n \u03d5 .\nProof. By induction on the length of derivation. We first verify soundness of the axioms.\n\u2022 Validity of (CL) immediate. Validity of (KS5) follows because the R\u2019s are equivalence relations [BdRV01].\n\u2022 Scheme (BF) is valid: |=n \u00acB\u22a5.\nJ\u22a5Kn = \u2205 /\u2208 N(w) by (kbf). Hence M, w 6|=n B\u22a5.\n\u2022 Scheme (N) is valid: |=n B\u22a4.\nJ\u22a4Kn \u2229 [w] = [w] \u2208 N(w) by (n). Hence M, w |=n B\u22a4.\n\u2022 Scheme (Ap) is valid: |=n B\u03d5 \u2192 KB\u03d5.\nSuppose M, w |=n B\u03d5. Then [w]\u2229 J\u03d5Kn \u2208 N(w). Take v \u2208 [w]. We have [v] = [w] because R is an equivalence relation, and we have N(v) = N(w) by (a). Hence [v] \u2229 J\u03d5Kn \u2208 N(v); that is, M, v |=n B\u03d5. Since v \u2208 [w] was chosen arbitrarily, we have shown that [w] \u2286 JB\u03d5Kn. Hence M, w |=n KB\u03d5.\n\u2022 Scheme (An) is valid: |=n \u00acB\u03d5 \u2192 K\u00acB\u03d5.\nReplace B\u03d5 by \u00acB\u03d5 and \u2208 by /\u2208 in the argument for the previous item.\n\u2022 Scheme (KBM) is valid: |=n K(\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8) \u2192 (B\u03d5 \u2192 B\u03c8).\nSuppose M, w |=n K(\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8) and M, w |=n B\u03d5. This means [w] \u2286 J\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8Kn and [w] \u2229 J\u03d5Kn \u2208 N(w). But then\n[w] \u2229 J\u03d5Kn \u2286 [w] \u2229 J\u03d5Kn \u2229 J\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8Kn \u2286 [w] \u2229 J\u03c8Kn .\nHence [w] \u2229 J\u03c8Kn \u2208 N(w) by (kbm). That is, M, w |=n B\u03c8.\nThat validity is closed under applications of the rules MP and MN follows by the standard arguments [BdRV01]. This completes the proof of soundness.\nBefore we prove completeness, we first prove an important result that we will use tacitly throughout the completeness proof proper. Let M be the set of all LKB-formulas having one of the forms K\u03d5, \u00acK\u03d5, B\u03d5, or \u00acB\u03d5. We prove the following Modal-Assumption Deduction Theorem: for each finite F \u2286 M , we have\nF \u22a2KB \u03d5 iff \u22a2KB ( \u2227 F ) \u2192 \u03d5 .\nThe right-to-left direction straightforward. The proof of the left-to-right direction is by induction on the length of derivation. All cases are standard except for the induction step in which (MN) is applied, so we focus on this case. Suppose F \u22a2KB K\u03d5 is derived by (MP) from \u03d5 such that F \u22a2KB \u03d5. By the induction hypothesis, we have \u22a2KB ( \u2227\n\u03c7\u2208F \u03c7) \u2192 \u03d5. By (MN) and K reasoning, we have \u22a2KB ( \u2227\n\u03c7\u2208F K\u03c7) \u2192 K\u03d5. However, it also follows by S5 reasoning (using schemes 4 and 5), scheme (Ap), scheme (An), and the fact that F \u2286 M that we have \u22a2KB \u03c7 \u2192 K\u03c7 for each \u03c7 \u2208 F . Hence \u22a2KB ( \u2227 \u03c7\u2208F \u03c7) \u2192 ( \u2227 \u03c7\u2208F K\u03c7), where ( \u2227 \u03c7\u2208F \u03c7) = \u2227\nF . Conclusion: \u22a2KB ( \u2227 F ) \u2192 K\u03d5.\nTo prove completeness, it suffices to show that KB 0 \u00ac\u03b8 implies \u03b8 is satisfiable at a pointed epistemic neighborhood model. For two sets F and F \u2032 of LKB-formulas, to say that F is maxcons in F \u2032 means that F \u2286 F \u2032, the set F is KB-consistent (i.e., for no finite G \u2286 F do we have \u22a2KB ( \u2227 G) \u2192 \u22a5), and adding any formula \u03c8 \u2208 F \u2032 not already in F will produce a KB-inconsistent (i.e., not KB-consistent) set.\nFor a set F of LKB-formulas, we define the single-negation closure \u00b1F of F and the modal closure MCl(F ) of F to be the sets\n\u00b1F := F \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2208 F} \u222a {\u22a5,\u22a4} ,\nMCl(F ) := F \u222a {X\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2208 F and X \u2208 {K,\u00acK,B,\u00acB}} .\nIn particular, MCl(F ) is obtained from F by adding for each formula\u03d5 \u2208 F the additional formulas K\u03d5, \u00acK\u03d5, B\u03d5, and \u00acB\u03d5. We say the each of the latter four formulas is a modalization of \u03d5.\nLet S be the set of subformulas of \u03b8, including \u03b8 itself. Let C0 be the Boolean closure of S; that is, C0 is the smallest extension of S that contains the propositional constants \u22a4 (truth) and \u22a5 (falsehood), or their abbreviations in LKB if they are not primitive, and is closed under the Boolean connectives (e.g., negation, conjunction, implication, and disjunction) definable in the language. Finally, define C := MCl(C0).\nWe define the structure M = (W,R, V,N) as follows:\nW := {w \u2286 C | w is maxcons in C},\n[\u03d5] := {w \u2208 W | \u03d5 \u2208 w} for \u03d5 \u2208 C,\nR := {(w, v) \u2208 W 2 | w \u2229M = v \u2229M},\nV (w) := P \u2229 w,\nN(w) := {X \u2286 [w] | \u2203\u03d5 \u2208 C : (X = [\u03d5] \u2229 [w] and w \u2229M \u22a2KB B\u03d5)}.\nWe make use (often tacitly) of the following In-class Identity Lemma: for each u, v \u2208 W , if [u] = [v] and u \u2229 \u00b1S = v \u2229 \u00b1S, then u = v. So suppose [u] = [v] and u \u2229 S \u2032 = v \u2229 S \u2032. Given \u03d5 \u2208 u, we wish to show that \u03d5 \u2208 u. There are two cases to consider.\n\u2022 Case: \u03d5 \u2208 u \u2229 C0.\n\u03d5 is a Boolean combination of members of S and is therefore KB-provably equivalent to a formula \u03d5\u2032 that is a disjunction of conjunctions of maxcons subsets of \u00b1S. It follows by the maximal KB-consistency of u that \u03d5\u2032 \u2208 u and hence one of the disjuncts \u03d5\u2032\u2032 of \u03d5\u2032 is a member of u. Applying the maimal KB-consistency of u, it follows from \u03d5\u2032\u2032 \u2208 u that every conjunct of \u03d5\u2032\u2032 is a member of u. But each conjunct of \u03d5\u2032\u2032 is a member of \u00b1S \u2286 S \u2032 and hence each conjunct of \u03d5\u2032\u2032 is a member of v by our assumption u \u2229 S \u2032 = v \u2229 S \u2032. Applying the maximal KB-consistency of v, it follows that \u03d5\u2032\u2032 \u2208 v, hence \u03d5\u2032 \u2208 v, and hence \u03d5 \u2208 v.\n\u2022 Case: \u03d5 \u2208 u \u2229 (C \u2212 C0).\n\u03d5 is a modalization X\u03c8 of a Boolean combination of members of S. But X\u03c8 \u2208 M and our assumption [u] = [v] implies u \u2229M = v \u2229M . So X\u03c8 \u2208 v.\nThe converse is proved similarly. The In-class Identity Lemma gives rise to the following Identity Lemma: for each u, v \u2208 W , if u \u2229 MCl(\u00b1S) = v \u2229MCl(\u00b1S), then u = v. Indeed, suppose u \u2229 MCl(\u00b1S) = v \u2229 MCl(\u00b1S). If [u] = [v], then it follows from \u00b1S \u2286 MCl(\u00b1S) that we have u \u2229 \u00b1S = v \u2229 \u00b1S, and therefore u = v by the In-class Identity Lemma. So it suffices to prove that [u] = [v]; that is, we prove that\nu \u2229M = v \u2229M . Proceeding, take X\u03d5 \u2208 u \u2229M . If X\u03d5 \u2208 C0, then we have X\u03d5 \u2208 v \u2229M by the argument in the first case of the In-class Identity Lemma. So suppose X\u03d5 \u2208 C \u2212 C0 so that X\u03d5 is a modalization of \u03d5 \u2208 C0. We have \u22a2KB \u03d5 \u2194 \u03d5\u2032, where \u03d5\u2032 is a disjunction of conjunctions of maxcons subsets of \u00b1S. Applying (MN) and K reasoning, we obtain\n\u22a2KB K\u03d5 \u2194 K\u03d5 \u2032 and \u22a2KB \u00acK\u03d5 \u2194 \u00acK\u03d5 \u2032 . (19)\nApplying (KBM) and classical reasoning to (19), it follows that\n\u22a2KB B\u03d5 \u2194 B\u03d5 \u2032 and \u22a2KB \u00acB\u03d5 \u2194 \u00acB\u03d5 \u2032 . (20)\nSince X\u03d5 \u2208 u, we have by (19), (20), and the maximal KB-consistency of u that X\u03d5\u2032 \u2208 u \u2229 MCl(\u00b1S). Since u \u2229MCl(\u00b1S) = v \u2229MCl(\u00b1S), it follows that X\u03d5\u2032 \u2208 v, and hence X\u03d5 \u2208 v by the maximal KB-consistency of v. The converse is proved similarly.\nWe may make use (often tacitly) of the following Definability Lemma: for each w \u2208 W and each X \u2286 [w], defining\nXd := \u2228\nv\u2208X\n\u2227 (v \u2229 \u00b1S) ,\nit follows that Xd \u2208 C0 \u2286 C and [Xd] \u2229 [w] = X . For the proof, first note that Xd \u2208 C0 because C0 is closed under Boolean operations and \u00b1S \u2286 C0 \u2286 C. So assume u \u2208 [Xd] \u2229 [w], which implies Xd \u2208 u and [u] = [w]. Since u is maxcons in C \u2287 \u00b1S, we have by the above definition of Xd as a disjunction over v \u2208 X that there exists v \u2208 X such that \u2227 (v \u2229 \u00b1S) \u2208 u and hence v\u2229\u00b1S \u2286 u. Since u is maxcons in C and hence maxcons in \u00b1S and since \u00b1S is closed under the operation \u223c : LKB \u2192 LKB defined by\n\u223c\u03d5 :=\n{\n\u03c8 if \u03d5 = \u00ac\u03c8\n\u00ac\u03d5 otherwise,\nit follows that u \u2229 \u00b1S = v \u2229 \u00b1S. So since [u] = [v] and u \u2229 \u00b1S = v \u2229 \u00b1S, we have u = v \u2208 X by the Identity Lemma. Conversely, suppose u \u2208 X \u2286 [w]. By the definition of Xd, we have KB \u22a2 \u2227 (u \u2229 \u00b1S) \u2192 Xd and therefore Xd \u2208 u because u is maxcons in C and \u2227 (u \u2229 \u00b1S) \u2208 u. Hence u \u2208 [Xd] \u2229 [w] because u \u2208 X \u2286 [w]. Our definitions above specify the structure M = (W,R, V,N). W is nonempty because \u03b8 is consistent and so may be extended to a maxcons w\u03b8 \u2208 W . Since MCl(\u00b1S) is finite, it follows by the Identity Lemma that W is finite. Further, R is an equivalence relation. So to conclude that M is an epistemic neighborhood model, all that remains is for us to show that N satisfies the neighborhood function properties.\n(kbc) X \u2208 N(w) implies X \u2286 [w].\nBy definition.\n(bf) \u2205 /\u2208 N(w).\nChoose \u03d5 \u2208 C satisfying [\u03d5] \u2229 [w] = \u2205. It follows that w \u2229M \u22a2KB \u03d5 \u2192 \u22a5, since otherwise we could extend (w\u2229M)\u222a{\u03d5} to some v \u2208 [\u03d5]\u2229 [w], which would contradict [\u03d5]\u2229 [w] = \u2205.\nSo by (MN), we have w\u2229M \u22a2KB K(\u03d5 \u2192 \u22a5) and hence w\u2229M \u22a2KB B\u03d5 \u2192 B\u22a5 by (KBM). Since w \u2229 M \u22a2 \u00acB\u22a5 by (BF), it follows that w \u2229 M \u22a2KB \u00acB\u03d5. So we have shown that w \u2229 M \u22a2KB \u00acB\u03d5 for each \u03d5 \u2208 C satisfying [\u03d5] \u2229 [w] = \u2205. KB is consistent (just apply soundness to any epistemic neighborhood model), and therefore we have w \u2229 M 0KB B\u03d5 for each \u03d5 \u2208 C satisfying [\u03d5] \u2229 [w] = \u2205. Conclusion: \u2205 /\u2208 N(w).\n(n) [w] \u2208 N(w).\nw \u2229M \u22a2KB B\u22a4 by (N). Hence [\u22a4] \u2229 [w] = [w] \u2208 N(w).\n(a) v \u2208 [w] implies N(v) = N(w).\nv \u2208 [w] implies [v] = [w] and v \u2229M = w \u2229M . Therefore for each X \u2286 [v] = [w], we have \u03d5 \u2208 C satisfying X = [\u03d5] \u2229 [v] and v \u2229M \u22a2KB B\u03d5 iff X = [\u03d5] \u2229 [w] and w \u2229M \u22a2KB B\u03d5. Hence N(v) = N(w).\n(kbm) If X \u2286 Y \u2286 [w] and X \u2208 N(w), then Y \u2208 N(w).\nSuppose X \u2286 Y \u2286 [w] and X \u2208 N(w). Then there is \u03d5 \u2208 C satisfying X = [\u03d5] \u2229 [w] and w \u2229 M \u22a2KB B\u03d5. Since X \u2286 Y , it follows that [\u03d5] \u2229 [w] \u2286 [Y d] \u2229 [w]. From this we obtain that w \u2229 M \u22a2KB \u03d5 \u2192 Y d, since otherwise we could extend (w \u2229 M) \u222a {\u03d5,\u00acY d} to some v \u2208 [\u03d5] \u2229 [\u00acY d] \u2229 [w], which would contradict [\u03d5] \u2229 [w] \u2286 [Y d] \u2229 [w]. Hence w \u2229 M \u22a2KB K(\u03d5 \u2192 Y d) by (MN) and so w \u2229 M \u22a2KB B\u03d5 \u2192 BY d by (KBM). Since w \u2229M \u22a2KB B\u03d5, we have w \u2229M \u22a2KB BY d. Hence Y \u2208 N(w).\nSo M is indeed and epistemic neighborhood model. To complete our overall argument, it suffices to prove the Truth Lemma: for each \u03d5 \u2208 C and w \u2208 W , we have \u03d5 \u2208 w iff M, w |=n \u03d5. The argument is by induction on the construction of \u03d5 \u2208 C. Boolean cases are straightforward, so we restrict our attention to the modal cases: formulas B\u03d5 and K\u03d5 in C. Note that by the definition of C as the Boolean closure of the set S of subformulas of \u03b8, either of B\u03d5 \u2208 C or K\u03d5 \u2208 C implies \u03d5 \u2208 C.\nSuppose B\u03d5 \u2208 w. Then w \u2229M \u22a2KB B\u03d5 and hence [\u03d5] \u2229 [w] \u2208 N(w) by the definition of N and the fact that \u03d5 \u2208 C. Applying the induction hypothesis, [\u03d5] = J\u03d5KMn , so J\u03d5K M n \u2229 [w] \u2208 N(w). But this is what it means to have M, w |=n B\u03d5. Conversely, assume M, w |=n B\u03d5 for B\u03d5 \u2208 C. This means J\u03d5KMn \u2229 [w] \u2208 N(w). By the induction hypothesis and the fact that \u03d5 \u2208 C, we have [\u03d5] = J\u03d5KMn , so [\u03d5] \u2229 [w] \u2208 N(w). By the definition of N , there exists \u03c8 \u2208 C such that w \u2229M \u22a2KB B\u03c8 and [\u03d5] \u2229 [w] = [\u03c8] \u2229 [w]. But then w \u2229M \u22a2KB \u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5, for otherwise we could extend (w \u2229M) \u222a {\u03c8,\u00ac\u03d5} to some v \u2208 [w] such that v \u2208 [\u03c8] \u2229 [w] and v /\u2208 [\u03d5] \u2229 [w], contradicting [\u03d5] \u2229 [w] = [\u03c8] \u2229 [w]. Applying (MN), we have w \u2229M \u22a2KB K(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5) and hence w \u2229M \u22a2KB B\u03c8 \u2192 B\u03d5 by (KBM). Since w \u2229M \u22a2KB B\u03c8, it follows that w \u2229M \u22a2KB B\u03d5. And since w is maxcons in C, we conclude that B\u03d5 \u2208 w.\nNow suppose K\u03d5 \u2208 w. Then for each v \u2208 [w], we have that K\u03d5 \u2208 v and therefore \u03d5 \u2208 v by S5 reasoning (using scheme T) and the fact that v is maxcons in C. But then we have shown that [w] \u2286 [\u03d5]. Since \u03d5 \u2208 C, it follows by the induction hypothesis that [w] \u2286 J\u03d5KMn , which is what it means to have M, w |=n K\u03d5.\nConversely, assume M, w |=n K\u03d5 for K\u03d5 \u2208 C. It follows that [w] \u2286 J\u03d5KMn . By the induction hypothesis, [w] \u2286 [\u03d5]. But then w \u2229M \u22a2KB \u03d5, for otherwise we could extend (w \u2229M) \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5} to some v \u2208 [w] satisfying v /\u2208 [\u03d5], contradicting [w] \u2286 [\u03d5]. By (MN), we have w \u2229M \u22a2KB K\u03d5. Since K\u03d5 \u2208 C and w is maxcons in C, it follows that K\u03d5 \u2208 w.\nSince KB is sound and complete with respect to the class of epistemic neighborhood models, we would expect that in light of Theorem 4.7 that KB is at most sound for the probability interpretation.\nTheorem 5.4 (KB Probability Soundness). KB is sound for any threshold c \u2208 (0, 1) \u2229 Q with respect to the class of epistemic probability models:\n\u2200c \u2208 (0, 1) \u2229Q, \u2200\u03d5 \u2208 LKB : KB \u22a2 \u03d5 \u21d2 |=p \u03d5c .\nProof. Theorems 3.2 and 3.9.\nTheorem 5.5 (KB Probability Incompleteness). KB is incomplete for all thresholds c \u2208 (0, 1)\u2229Q with respect to the class of epistemic probability models:\n\u2203\u03d5 \u2208 LKB, \u2200c \u2208 (0, 1) \u2229Q : |=p \u03d5c and KB 0 \u03d5 .\nProof. Take M as in the proof of Theorem 4.7. Let \u03c3 be the modal formula describing (M, a): informally (and easily formalizable),\n\u03c3 := ab\u0304 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 g\u0304 \u2227KW \u2227 ( \u2227 Z\u2208N(a) BZ) \u2227 ( \u2227 Z\u2032\u2208\u2118(W )\u2212N(a) \u00acBZ \u2032) .\nWe have M, w |=n \u03c3 so that 6|=n \u00ac\u03c3 and therefore KB 0 \u00ac\u03c3 by Theorem 5.3. By the proof of Theorem 4.7, there is no probability measure agreeing with M for any threshold. Hence |=p \u00ac\u03c3c. So \u03d5 := \u00ac\u03c3 gives us the desired formula.\n5.2 Results for the Mid-Threshold Calculus KB.5\nWe first show that the KB schemes (BF) and (KBM) are redundant in the theory KB.5.\nTheorem 5.6. KB.5\u2212 and KB.5 derive the same theorems:\n\u2200\u03d5 \u2208 LKB : KB.5 \u2212 \u22a2 \u03d5 \u21d4 KB.5 \u22a2 \u03d5 .\nProof. It suffices to prove that the schemes (BF) and (KBM) are derivable in KB.5\u2212. For (KBM), we have by Definition 3.7 that the formula \u03d5I\u03c8 is just\nK ( (\u00ac\u03d5 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8) \u2228 (\u00ac\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8) \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nF0\n\u2228 (\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8) \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nF1\n) , (21)\nwhere we have explicitly indicated the subformulasF0 and F1 used in the notation of Definition 3.7. Semantically, (21) says that in each of the agent\u2019s accessible worlds, \u03c8 is true whenever \u03d5 is true. Now reasoning within KB.5\u2212, it follows that K(\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8) is provably equivalent to \u03d5I\u03c8. But then\nfrom K(\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8) and B\u03d5, we may derive \u03d5I\u03c8 and B\u03d5, from which we may derive B\u03c8 by (Scott). Hence (KBM) is derivable.\nWe now consider (BF). The formula \u22a5 \u2192 \u00ac\u22a4 is a classical tautology and hence K(\u22a5 \u2192 \u00ac\u22a4) follows by (MN). Hence by an instance of (KBM), which can be defined away in terms of axioms other than (BF) as above, it follows that B\u22a5 \u2192 B\u00ac\u22a4 and therefore that \u00acB\u00ac\u22a4 \u2192 \u00acB\u22a5. Also by (N), (D), and (MP), we may derive \u00acB\u00ac\u22a4. That is, (BF) is derivable.\nTheorem 5.7 (KB.5 Neighborhood Soundness and Completeness). KB.5 is sound and complete with respect to the class C.5 of mid-threshold neighborhood models:\n\u2200\u03d5 \u2208 LKB : KB.5 \u22a2 \u03d5 \u21d4 C .5 |=n \u03d5 .\nProof. Soundness is by induction on the length of derivation. Most cases are as in the proof of Theorem 5.3. We only need consider the remaining axiom schemes.\n\u2022 Scheme (D) is valid: |=n B\u03d5 \u2192 B\u030c\u03d5.\nSuppose M, w |=n B\u03d5. This means [w] \u2229 J\u03d5Kn \u2208 N(w). By (d),\n[w] \u2229 J\u00ac\u03c8Kn = [w]\u2212 J\u03d5Kn = [w]\u2212 ([w] \u2229 J\u03d5Kn) /\u2208 N(w) .\nBut this is what it means to have M, w |=n B\u030c\u03d5.\n\u2022 Scheme (SC) is valid: |=n B\u030c\u03d5 \u2227 K\u030c(\u00ac\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8) \u2192 B(\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8).\nSuppose M, w |=n B\u030c\u03d5 and M, w |=n K\u030c(\u00ac\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8). It follows that\n[w]\u2212 ([w] \u2229 J\u03d5Kn) = [w] \u2229 J\u00ac\u03d5Kn /\u2208 N(w)\nand that there exists v \u2208 [w] satisfying M, v |= \u00ac\u03d5\u2227\u03c8. But then [w]\u2229J\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8Kn ) [w]\u2229J\u03d5Kn and therefore [w] \u2229 J\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8Kn \u2208 N(w) by (sc). Hence M, w |= B(\u03d5 \u2228 \u03c8).\n\u2022 Scheme (Scott) is valid:\n|=n [(\u03d5iI\u03c8i)mi=1 \u2227 B\u03d51 \u2227 \u2227m i=2 B\u030c\u03d5i] \u2192 \u2228m i=1B\u03c8i .\nSuppose (M, w) satisfies the antecedent of scheme (Scott). It follows that each v \u2208 [w] satisfies at least as many \u03d5i\u2019s as \u03c8i\u2019s, that [w]\u2229 J\u03c81Kn \u2208 N(w), and that [w]\u2212 J\u03d5kKn /\u2208 N(w) for each k \u2208 {2, . . . , m}. Hence\n[w] \u2229 J\u03d51Kn, . . . , [w] \u2229 J\u03d5mKnI[w] \u2229 J\u03c81Kn, . . . , [w] \u2229 J\u03c8mKn ,\nfrom which it follows by (scott) that [w] \u2229 J\u03c8jKn \u2208 N(w) for some j \u2208 {1, . . . , m}. Hence M, w |=n B\u03c8j , and thus M, w |=n \u2228m i=1B\u03c8i.\nSoundness has been proved. For completeness, it suffices to show that the model M defined as in the proof of Theorem 5.3\u2014except that now derivability is always taken with respect to KB.5\u2014is a mid-threshold neighborhood model; the rest of the argument is as in that proof, mutatis mutandis. Most of the properties of M are shown in that proof. What remains is for us to show that M also satisfies (d), (sc), and (scott).\n(d) X \u2208 N(w) implies X \u2032 /\u2208 N(w), where X \u2032 := [w]\u2212X .\nSuppose X \u2208 N(w). Then we have \u03d5 \u2208 C such that X = [\u03d5] \u2229 [w] and w \u2229M \u22a2KB.5 B\u03d5. By (D), it follows that w \u2229M \u22a2KB.5 B\u030c\u03d5. Choose \u03c8 \u2208 C satisfying X \u2032 = [\u03c8]\u2229 [w]. We have w \u2229 M \u22a2KB.5 \u03c8 \u2192 \u00ac\u03d5, since otherwise we could extend (w \u2229 M) \u222a {\u03c8, \u03d5} to a v \u2208 [w] such that v \u2208 [\u03c8] \u2229 [w] = X \u2032 and v \u2208 [\u03d5] \u2229 [w] = X , contradicting X \u2032 \u2229X = \u2205. By (MP), we have w \u2229M \u22a2KB.5 K(\u03c8 \u2192 \u00ac\u03d5) and therefore w \u2229M \u22a2KB.5 B\u03c8 \u2192 B\u00ac\u03d5 by (KBM). So since B\u030c\u03d5 = \u00acB\u00ac\u03d5, it follows by classical reasoning that w \u2229M \u22a2KB.5 B\u030c\u03d5 \u2192 \u00acB\u03c8. Since w \u2229 M \u22a2KB.5 B\u030c\u03d5, it follows that w \u2229 M \u22a2KB.5 \u00acB\u03c8. By the consistency of KB.5 (which follows by applying soundness to any mid-threshold epistemic neighborhood model), we have w \u2229M 0KB B\u03c8. So we have shown that w \u2229M 0KB.5 B\u03c8 for each \u03c8 \u2208 C satisfying X \u2032 = [\u03c8] \u2229 [w].

It follows from X \u2032 /\u2208 N(w) that we have w \u2229 M 0KB.5 B(X \u2032)d. Since (X \u2032)d \u2208 C0, it follows that B(X \u2032)d \u2208 C = MCl(C0) and therefore \u00acB(X \u2032)d \u2208 w \u2229 M because w is maxcons in C. Hence w \u2229 M \u22a2KB.5 \u00acB(X \u2032)d. Now we have w\u2229M \u22a2KB.5 \u00acXd \u2192 (X \u2032)d, for otherwise we could extend (w\u2229M)\u222a{\u00acXd,\u00ac(X \u2032)d} to some v \u2208 [w] such that v \u2208 [\u00acXd]\u2229 [w] = X \u2032 and v \u2208 [\u00ac(X \u2032)d]\u2229 [w] = X , contradicting X \u2032\u2229X = \u2205. By (MP), we have w\u2229M \u22a2KB.5 K(\u00acXd \u2192 (X \u2032)d) and therefore w\u2229M \u22a2KB.5 B\u00acXd \u2192 B(X \u2032)d by (KBM). Since w\u2229M \u22a2KB.5 \u00acB(X \u2032)d, it follows by classical reasoning that w \u2229M \u22a2KB.5 \u00acB\u00acXd. That is, w \u2229M \u22a2KB.5 B\u030cXd.\nFurther, since X ( Y \u2286 [w], it follows that there exists y \u2208 Y \u2212 X satisfying y \u2208 [Y d] \u2212 [Xd] = [Y d \u2227 \u00acXd]. Since \u00ac(Y d \u2227 \u00acXd) \u2208 C0, it follows that \u00acK\u00ac(Y d \u2227 \u00acXd) \u2208 C = MCl(C0). But then K\u00ac(Y d \u2227 \u00acXd) /\u2208 w, for otherwise it would follow from y \u2208 [w] that w \u2229 M = y \u2229 M and hence K\u00ac(Y d \u2227 \u00acXd) \u2208 y, from which it would follow by T and the fact that y is maxcons in C that \u00ac(Y d \u2227 \u00acXd) \u2208 y, contradicting y \u2208 [Y d \u2227 \u00acXd]. So since K\u00ac(Y d \u2227 \u00acXd) /\u2208 w, we have by the fact that \u00acK\u00ac(Y d \u2227 \u00acXd) \u2208 C and the maximal KB.5-consistency of w that \u00acK\u00ac(Y d \u2227 \u00acXd) = K\u030c(Y d \u2227 \u00acXd) \u2208 w. Hence w \u2229 M \u22a2KB.5 K\u030c(Y d \u2227 \u00acXd). As w \u2229 M \u22a2KB.5 B\u030cXd as well, it follows by (SC) that w\u2229M \u22a2KB.5 B(Y d \u2228Xd). But [Y d \u2228Xd] = Y by our assumption X ( Y and therefore we have shown that Y \u2208 N(w).\n(scott) If X1, . . . , Xm, Y1, . . . , Ym \u2286 [w], (XiIYi)mi=1, X1 \u2208 N(w), and X \u2032 i := [w]\u2212 Xi /\u2208 N(w)\nfor all i \u2208 {2, . . . , m}, then there exists j \u2208 {1, . . . , m} such that Yj \u2208 N(w).\nAssume we have the above-stated antecedent of the (scott) property. It follows from X1 \u2208 N(w) that w \u2229 M \u22a2KB.5 BXd1 . For i \u2208 {2, . . . , m}, it follows from X \u2032 i /\u2208 N(w) by an argument as in the above proof for (sc) that w \u2229 M \u22a2 B\u030cXdi . If we can prove that w \u2229 M \u22a2KB.5 (Xdi IY d i ) m i=1 as well, then we would have by (Scott) that w \u2229M \u22a2KB.5 \u2228m j=1BY d j . But then since BY dj \u2208 C for each j \u2208 {1, . . . , m}, we would have BY d k \u2208 w for some k \u2208 {1, . . . , m} by the maximal KB.5-consistency of w, hence w \u2229 M \u22a2KB.5 BY dk , and hence Yk = [Y dk ] \u2208 N(w).\nSo it suffices for us to prove that w \u2229 M \u22a2KB.5 (Xdi IY d i ) m i=1. Proceeding, we recall that (Xdi IY d i ) m i=1 abbreviates the formula K(F0 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 Fm), where Fk is the disjunction of all conjunctions d1X d 1 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 dmX d m \u2227 e1Y d 1 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 emY d m , (22)\nsatisfying the property that exactly k of the di\u2019s are the empty string, at least k of the ei\u2019s are the empty string, and the rest of the di\u2019s and ei\u2019s are the negation sign \u00ac. Since each of the Xi\u2019s and Yi\u2019s is a member of C0 and C0 is closed under Boolean operations, each conjunction (22) is a member of C0, and hence so is the disjunction F0 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 Fm. But then K(F0 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 Fm) \u2208 C = MCl(C0). We make use of these facts tacitly in what follows. Now we have by our assumption (XiIYi)mi=1 and the fact that the Xi\u2019s and Yi\u2019s are subsets of [w] that every world in [w] is contained in at least as many of the Xi\u2019s as in the Yi\u2019s. Every world in [w] therefore contains at least one of the Fi\u2019s, for otherwise it would follow by maximal KB.5-consistency that we could find a world v \u2208 [w] that is not contained in at least as many of the Xi\u2019s as in the Yi\u2019s, a contradiction. By maximal KB.5-consistency, every world in [w] thereby contains the disjunction F0 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 Fm. But then it follows by maximal KB.5-consistency and T-reasoning that K(F0 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 Fm) \u2208 w, and hence w \u2229M \u22a2KB.5 (Xdi IY d i ) m i=1.\nSince KB.5 is sound and complete with respect to mid-threshold neighborhood models, we would expect from Corollary 4.11 that KB.5 is sound and complete with respect to the probability interpretation for threshold c = 1\n2 .\nTheorem 5.8 (Due to [Len80]; KB.5 Probability Soundness and Completeness). KB.5 is sound and complete for threshold 1\n2 with respect to the class of epistemic probability models:\n\u2200\u03d5 \u2208 LKB : KB.5 \u22a2 \u03d5 \u21d4 |=p \u03d5 1 2 .\nProof. Soundness is by Theorems 3.2 and 3.9. Completeness is by Theorem 5.7 and Corollary 4.11."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "Summary We have provided a study of unary modal logics of high probability. We introduced epistemic neighborhood models and studied their connection to traditional epistemic probability models by way of a natural notion of \u201cagreement.\u201d We listed the Lenzen-derivative properties of epistemic neighborhood models that guarantee the existence of an agreeing probability measure for threshold c = 1\n2 . The list of properties required to guarantee the existence of an agreeing\nprobability measure for other thresholds is unknown. We also presented our study from a proof theoretic point of view by introducing a probabilistically sound but incomplete logic KB and our version of Lenzen\u2019s probabilistically sound and complete logic KB.5 for threshold c = 1\n2 . It is\nopen as to the principles one must add to KB in order to obtain probabilistic completeness for other thresholds. We also proved soundness and completeness of KB and of KB.5 with respect to a corresponding class of epistemic neighborhood models. The result for KB.5 along with our\nTheorem 4.10, a theorem we credit to Lenzen, shows thatKB.5 is the logic of probabilistic certainty and of probability exceeding c = 1\n2 . It is our hope that our repackaging of Professor Lenzen\u2019s result\nwill make his work more accessible to a broad audience of modern modal logicians. We also hope that the connection we have made with neighborhood semantics will prove useful in future work on modal logics of qualitative probability.\nOpen Questions for Future Work\n1. The main open question is the following: given a \u201chigh-threshold\u201d c \u2208 (1 2 , 1) \u2229 Q, find the\nexact extension KBc of KB that is probabilistically sound and complete for threshold c with respect to the class of epistemic probability models, in the sense that we would have:\n\u2200\u03d5 \u2208 LKB : KB c \u22a2 \u03d5 \u21d4 |=p \u03d5c .\nObserving that (SC) and (Scott) are not valid for high-thresholds c > 1 2 , we conjecture that what is required are threshold-specific variants of (SC) and (Scott) that will together guarantee probability soundness and completeness. Toward this end, we suggest the following schemes as a starting point:\n(SCs0) (K\u030c\u03d50 \u2227 \u2227s i=1 B\u030c\u03d5i \u2227 \u2227s i 6=j=0K(\u03d5i \u2192 \u00ac\u03d5j)) \u2192 B( \u2228s i=0 \u03d5i) (SCs1) ( \u2227s i=1 B\u030c\u03d5i \u2227 \u2227s i 6=j=1K(\u03d5i \u2192 \u00ac\u03d5j)) \u2192 B( \u2228s i=1 \u03d5i) (WS) [(\u03d5iI\u03c8i)mi=1 \u2227 \u2227m i=1B\u03d5i] \u2192 \u2228m i=1B\u03c8i\nObserve that (SC) is just (SC10). Further, if we define s \u2032 := c/(1 \u2212 c) and s := ceiling(s\u2032), then scheme (SCs0) is probabilistically sound if s = s \u2032 and scheme (SCs1) is probabilistically sound if s 6= s\u2032. The reasoning for this is as follows: s\u2032 tells us the number of (1 \u2212 c)\u2019s that divide c. In particular, recall from Lemma 3.5 that the probabilistic interpretation of B\u030c\u03d5 is that \u03d5 is assigned probability at least 1 \u2212 c. Therefore, if we have s disjoint propositions that each have probability at least 1 \u2212 c, then the probability of their disjunction will have probability s \u00b7(1\u2212c) \u2265 c. This inequality is strict if s 6= s\u2032 and is in fact an equality if s = s\u2032. Therefore, in the case s 6= s\u2032, scheme (SCs1) is sound: s disjoint propositions each having probability 1\u2212 c together sum to a probability exceeding the threshold c. And in case s = s\u2032, scheme (SCs0) is sound: s disjoint propositions each having probability 1 \u2212 c together sum to a probability that equals c, so adding some additional probability from another disjoint proposition \u03d50 will yield a disjunction whose probability again exceeds c. In either case, exceeding probability c is what we equate with belief, so soundness is proved. We note that scheme (WS) can be shown to be sound by adapting the proof Theorem 3.9(11). The epistemic neighborhood model versions of (SCs0), (SC s 1), and (WS) are:\n(scs0) \u2200X1, . . . , Xs, Y \u2286 [w]: if [w] \u2212 X1, . . . , [w] \u2212 Xs /\u2208 N(w), the Xi\u2019s are pairwise disjoint, and Y )\n\u22c3s i=1Xi, then Y \u2208 N(w).\n(scs1) \u2200X1, . . . , Xs \u2286 [w]: if [w] \u2212 X1, . . . , [w] \u2212 Xs /\u2208 N(w) and the Xi\u2019s are pairwise disjoint, then\n\u22c3s i=1Xi \u2208 N(w).\n(ws) \u2200m \u2208 Z+, \u2200X1, . . . , Xm, Y1, . . . , Ym \u2286 [w] :\nif X1, . . . , XmIY1, . . . , Ym and\n\u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , m} : Xi \u2208 N(w) ,\nthen \u2203j \u2208 {1, . . . , m} : Yj \u2208 N(w) .\nIf M is an epistemic neighborhood model, then a slight modification of the proof of property (scott) in Lemma 4.13 shows that M c satisfies (ws). We presume that an adaptation of the proof for the proof of property (sc) in the same lemma will show that M c satisfies (scs0) if s = s\u2032 and (scs1) if s 6= s \u2032.\nWe remark that (WS) is not threshold-specific, though it is sound for all high-thresholds c > 1 2 . We suspect that a threshold-specific variant may be required in order to adapt Lenzen\u2019s proof of KB.5 probability soundness and completeness for threshold c = 1 2 (Theorem 4.10).\n2. Another open question is the exact relationship between Segerberg\u2019s comparitive operator \u03d5 \u03c8 (\u201c\u03d5 is no more probable than \u03c8\u201d) [Ga\u0308r75, Seg71] and our unary operators K and B. The formula B\u03d5 is equivalent to \u00ac\u03d5 \u227a \u03d5. However, it is not clear how the logics of these operators are related. Also, we suspect that a language with is strictly more expressive.\n3. Yet another direction is the extension of our work to Bayesian updating. Given a pointed epistemic probability model (M, w) satisfying \u03d5, let\nM[\u03d5] = (W [\u03d5], R[\u03d5], V [\u03d5], P [\u03d5])\nbe defined by\nW [\u03d5] := J\u03d5KMp R[\u03d5] := R \u2229 (W [\u03d5]\u00d7W [\u03d5])\nV [\u03d5](w) := V (w) for w \u2208 W [\u03d5]\nP [\u03d5](w) := P (w)\nP (J\u03d5KMp )\nIt is not difficult to see that M[\u03d5] is an epistemic probability model and\nP [\u03d5](X) = P (X \u2229 J\u03d5KMp )\nP (J\u03d5KMp ) = P [\u03d5](X|J\u03d5KMp ) ,\nwhere the value on the right is the probability of X conditional on J\u03d5KMp . It would be interesting to investigate the analog of this operation in epistemic neighborhood models. The operation may also have a close relationship with the study of updates in Probabilistic Dynamic Epistemic Logic [vBGK09, BS08].\n4. Finally, we have only considered a single-agent version of our logics KB and KB.5. The reason for this is that obtaining completeness for KB.5 with respect to the class of finite mid-threshold neighborhood models requires us to construct a finite countermodel satisfying (sc), as we did in the completeness portion of the proof of Theorem 5.7. However, this property has an antecedent that includes the negative condition X \u2032 /\u2208 N(w) and from this and X ( Y \u2286 [w], we are to conclude the positive condition Y \u2208 N(w). Referring the reader to the completeness portions of the proofs of Theorems 5.3 and 5.7 for definitions and terminology, the trick to making things work in the single-agent case is to prove the Definability Lemma using a particular closure construction that ensures every potential neighborhood X \u2286 [w] is definable by a formula Xd such that BXd is a member of the closure set C. This makes crucial use of the In-class Identity Lemma. However, our proof of this lemma depends on the assumption that maxcons sets u, v \u2208 [w] differ only in non-modal formulas. In the straightforward multi-agent version of our setting, we would have an equivalence class [w]a consisting of all maxcons sets that agree on modal formulas Ka\u03d5 and Ba\u03c8 for a given agent a. But then two worlds u, v \u2208 [w]a could disagree on modal formulas Kb\u03d5 or Bb\u03c8 for some agent b 6= a, which leads to a breakdown in the current proof of the In-class Identity Lemma and therefore presents problems for guaranteeing definability of potential neighborhoods satisfying the desired membership property. Remedying this in a multi-agent version of a finite mid-threshold neighborhood model is not straightforward because it is difficult to simultaneously satisfy (sc), all other properties of finite mid-threshold neighborhood models, and the definability-with-membership property. We therefore leave for future work the matter of proving completeness of multi-agent KB.5 with respect to the class of finite multi-agent mid-threshold neighborhood models. We note that multi-agent KB.5 is obtained from our existing axiomatization by simply adding a subscript to all occurrences of a modal operator K or B in our present axiomatization. Multi-agent KB is obtained similarly, though completeness for multi-agent KB with respect to the full class of finite multi-agent epistemic neighborhood models can be shown without much difficulty because the problematic property (sc) need not be satisfied.\nAcknowledgements Thanks to Alexandru Baltag, Johan van Benthem, Jim Delgrande, Peter van Emde Boas, Andreas Herzig, Thomas Icard, Sonja Smets, and Rineke Verbrugge for helpful comments and pointers to the literature."}], "references": [{"title": "Modal Logic.
