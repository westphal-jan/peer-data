It has been intensively investigated, not only its theoretical aspects, but also its numerous applications, and the approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using several levels of membership grades have became an important research direction.\nRecently, researchers [1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14\u201316, 20\u201322, 40] have investigated fuzzy sets from different aspects. For example, Pedrycz [22] proposed shadowed sets for interpreting fuzzy sets by using several\n\u2217Corresponding author.

Sequently, a lot of investigations [2\u20134, 8, 11, 19, 23\u201327, 32, 41] have been done on shadowed sets. For instance, Deng et al. [7] computed a pair of thresholds, whose interpretation and determination is a fundamental issue for expressing fuzzy sets, for three-way approximations of fuzzy sets by using loss functions, and classify a set of objects into three regions by using the pair of thresholds. In practical situations, interval-valued fuzzy sets whose membership functions are using the subintervals of the interval [0, 1] are of interest because such type of sets are frequently encountered. So far we have not seen the similar investigation on interval-valued fuzzy sets. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate that how to express interval-valued fuzzy sets as fuzzy sets.\nTo computing and interpreting a pair of thresholds, a lot of investigations [13\u201318, 33\u201337] have been done on three-way decision-theory by using loss functions in literatures. For example, Li et al. [13] evaluated the cost and benefit of assigning an instance to a specific subcategory and defined a general loss function for supervised leaning. Liang et al. [14, 15] presented triangular fuzzy decision-theoretic rough sets and systematic studies on three-way decisions with interval-valued decision-theoretic rough sets. Liu et al. [17] proposed stochastic decision-theoretic rough sets, interval-valued decision-theoretic rough sets, fuzzy decision-theoretic rough sets and dynamic decision-theoretic rough sets. In practical situations, interval-valued loss functions as interval-valued numbers [16,28,29] are of interest because such functions are frequently encountered. Although interval-valued loss functions are complex in practice, we have not seen enough investigations on interval-valued fuzzy sets by using interval-valued loss functions so far. Therefore, it is urgent to further study interval-valued loss functions for making a decision by using threeway decision-theory.\nThe purpose of this paper is to further investigate interval-valued fuzzy sets. Section 2 introduces the basic principles of decision-theoretic rough sets, shadowed sets and decision-theoretic three-way approximations of fuzzy sets. Section 3 presents shadowed sets of interval-valued fuzzy sets. Section 4 is devoting to errors-based interpretation of shadowed sets of interval-valued fuzzy sets. Section 5 presents decisiontheoretic rough sets-based three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using transforming interval-valued loss functions into single loss functions. Section 6 investigates decision-theoretic rough sets-based three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using interval-valued loss functions from another view.

In a wide sense, a shadowed set is a three-valued fuzzy set, which is used to approximate an interval-valued fuzzy set. In a narrow sense, we interpret the notion of a shadowed set according to its exact formulation, namely, the choice of the set of membership grades {0, [0, 1], 1} and the objective function. Therefore, shadowed sets of interval-valued fuzzy sets are examples of three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets."}, {"heading": "3.2 Errors-based interpretation of shadowed sets for interval-valued fuzzy sets", "text": "In this section, we present a detailed analysis of a objective function for shadowed sets of intervalvalued fuzzy sets in terms of errors of approximations.

For an object x with membership grade m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)), the elevation operation changes the membership grade from m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) to 1, the reduction operation changes the membership grade from m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) to 0, and the errors induced by elevation and reduction are shown as\nEe(\u00b5A(x)) = 1 \u2212 m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)), Er(\u00b5A(x)) = m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)).\nThe errors Ee(\u00b5A) and Er(\u00b5A) induced by the elevation and reduction operations for an interval-valued\nfuzzy set A of the universe U, respectively, are shown as\nEe(\u00b5A) = \u2211\nm\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))\u2265\u03b1\n(1 \u2212 m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))), Er(\u00b5A(x)) = \u2211\nm\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))\u2264\u03b2\nm\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)).\nThe error for the shadowed area is not clear because of the unit interval [0, 1] as the membership grade when \u03b2 < m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) < \u03b1. By computing the difference between m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) and the maximum 1 and the minimum value 0 and summarizing them up, we have\nEs(\u00b5A) = \u2211\n\u03b2<m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))<\u03b1\n(1 \u2212 m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))) + \u2211\n\u03b2<m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))<\u03b1\nm\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)).\nSubsequently, we express the objective function in terms of errors by using the error-based interpreta-\ntion of the three areas as\nV(\u03b1,\u03b2)(\u00b5A)\n= |Ee(\u00b5A) + Er(\u00b5A) \u2212 Es(\u00b5A)| = | \u2211\nm\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))\u2265\u03b1\n(1 \u2212 m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))) + \u2211\nm\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))\u2264\u03b2\nm\u03b8(\u00b5A(x) \u2212 \u2211\n\u03b2<m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))<\u03b1\n(1 \u2212 m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))) + \u2211\n\u03b2<m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))<\u03b1\n(m\u03b8\u00b5A(x))|.\nThe objective function is a kind of trade-off of errors produced by three regions. But the rationale for such a trade-off is not entirely clear. On one hand, Es(m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))) consists the errors of elevation and reduction operations, and it is impossible to elevate m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) to 1 and reduce m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) to 0 if \u03b2 < m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) < \u03b1 simultaneously. On the other hand, we are not able to allocate any numeric membership grade for the elements in the shadowed area. In other words, any numeric value of the unit interval [0, 1] could be permitted to reflect the uncertainty. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate that which numeric value is meaningful to the membership grade of elements in the shadowed area.\nBelow, we present a three-way approximation of an interval-valued fuzzy set by replacing the unit\ninterval [0, 1] with 0.5 as,\nT\u00b5A(x) =  1, m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) \u2265 \u03b1; 0, m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) \u2264 \u03b2;\n0.5, \u03b2 < m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) < \u03b1.\nBy analyzing T\u00b5A(x), we see that the correspondences between areas of elevation and reduction and errors of elevation and reduction remain to be the same. But we need to revise the errors of the shadowed region as\nEs0.5 (\u00b5A) = \u2211\n0.5<m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))<\u03b1\n(1 \u2212 m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))) + \u2211\n\u03b2<m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))<0.5\n(m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))).\nBy using Ee(\u00b5A), Er(\u00b5A) and Es0.5 (\u00b5A), we have\nE(\u03b1,\u03b2)(\u00b5A) = Ee(\u00b5A) + Er(\u00b5A) + Es0.5 (\u00b5A)\n= \u2211\nm\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))\u2265\u03b1\n(1 \u2212 m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) + \u2211\nm\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))\u2264\u03b2\n(m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))) \u2212 \u2211\n0.5<m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))<\u03b1(t)\n(m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) \u2212 0.5)\n+ \u2211\n\u03b2<m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))<0.5\n(0.5 \u2212 m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))).\nThe total errors of the three areas are minimized instead of searching for a trade-off between different\nareas. Correspondingly, we express the total error as the summation of errors of all objects as\nE(\u03b1,\u03b2)(\u00b5A) = \u2211\nx\u2208U\nE(\u03b1,\u03b2)(m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))),\nwhere\nE(\u03b1,\u03b2)(\u00b5A(x)) =  1 \u2212 m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)), m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) \u2265 \u03b1; 0.5 \u2212 m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)), \u03b2 < m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) \u2264 0.5; m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) \u2212 0.5, 0.5 < m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) < \u03b1;\nm\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)), m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) \u2264 \u03b2.\nThe total error will be minimized by minimizing the error of each individual object, and we can search for a pair of thresholds \u03b1 and \u03b2 such that E(\u03b1,\u03b2)(\u00b5A(x)) is minimized for each object. We consider the following actions and associated errors for minimizing the error of each object:\n(1) : elevate to 1 : 1 \u2212 m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)); (2) : reduce to 0 : m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) \u2212 0; (3) : reduce or elevate to 0.5 : |m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) \u2212 0.5|.\nThat is, the absolute differences between m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) and three values 1, 0.5 and 0, respectively, are the associated errors. A minimized difference is obtained if m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x)) is changed into a value that is closest to m\u03b8(\u00b5A(x))."}, {"heading": "4 Decision-theoretic rough sets-based three-way approximations of intervalvalued fuzzy sets", "text": "In this section, we introduce a framework for decision-theoretic rough sets-based three-way approxi-\nmations of interval-valued fuzzy sets."}, {"heading": "4.1 Cost-sensitive three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets", "text": "In Section 3, we investigate three-way approximation of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using three membership grades of 0, 0.5 and 1.

sets.\n(1) Interpretations of interval-valued loss functions\nIn decision-theoretic three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets, the pair of thresholds depends on the choice of interval-valued loss functions which are fundamental notions of the decisiontheoretic model. In other words, given an interval-valued loss function, the pair of thresholds can be computed accordingly. On the other hand, if the pair of thresholds is interpreted in terms of an intervalvalued loss function, then the user can provide a better estimation of the thresholds in time. Therefore, the decision-theoretic model gives an interpretation of the pair of thresholds, and it is important to discuss approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using interval-valued loss functions.\n(2) Relationships to shadowed sets of fuzzy sets\nIn Sections 3 and 4, we see that three regions of decision-theoretic rough set-based three-way approximation T\u00b5(A) and shadowed set S \u00b5(A) are both defined through a pair of thresholds \u03b1 and \u03b2. For shadowed sets, the objective function is given with respect to the membership functions, and different membership functions will produce different shadowed sets. In contrast, the objective function of the decision-theoretic framework is given with respect to interval-valued loss functions, which is independent of any particular fuzzy membership functions.\n(3) Relationships to decision-theoretic rough sets\nIn Section 4, we adopt the main ideas from decision-theoretic rough set in developing decisiontheoretic rough set-based three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets. A rough membership function can be viewed as a fuzzy membership function. There are some differences between three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets and decision-theoretic rough sets. For decision-theoretic rough sets, we deal with two-state three-way decision problems. A rough membership function denotes the probability that an object is in the set. On the other hand, three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets are a many-state decision problem.\n(4) Relationships to decision-theoretic three-way approximations of fuzzy sets\nIn [7], Deng et al. discussed three-way approximations of fuzzy sets by using loss functions. In practice, there are a lot of interval-valued loss functions. Compare with Deng\u2019s model, we discuss threeway approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using interval-valued loss functions."}, {"heading": "8 Conclusions", "text": "Many researchers have investigated approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets. In this paper, firstly, we have presented shadowed sets for interpreting and understanding interval-valued fuzzy sets. Sec-\nondly, we have constructed decision-theoretic rough set-based three-way approximations of intervalvalued fuzzy sets. Thirdly, we have computed the pair of thresholds for decision-theoretic rough set-based three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using interval-valued loss functions. Fourthly, we have constructed approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using interval-valued loss functions from another view. Finally, we have employed several examples to illustrate that how to make a decision for interval-valued fuzzy sets by using interval-valued loss functions.\nThere are still many interesting topics deserving further investigations on fuzzy sets. For example, there are many types of fuzzy sets and loss functions, and it is of interest to investigate loss functionsbased three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets. In the future, we will further investigate interval-valued fuzzy sets and discuss its application in knowledge discovery.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank the anonymous reviewers very much for their professional comments and valuable suggestions.
