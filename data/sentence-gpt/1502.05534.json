Introduction\nLiver failures are at high rate of risk among Indians. The diagnosis of liver disorder at any early stage helps in designing effective prevention measures. In India, one in five persons is affected by liver disease. It is expected that by 2025 India may become the \u2018World Capital for Liver Diseases\u2019. The widespread occurrence of liver infection in India is contributed due to deskbound lifestyle, increased alcohol consumption and smoking [1]. There are about 100 types of liver infections. Most prevalent liver infections are cirrhosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. In the recent years sensors and mobile devices have been used extensively used for rapid detection of an infected liver [2]. The performance of these devices can be accelerated by spontaneous classification systems. Classification is a data mining technique comprising of a dual process flow. In the first step the classifier is trained using the training dataset, while the classifier is being tested for its prediction capacity in the second phase using different samples of the test set [3]. Feature selection is the preliminary step to be performed prior to application of classification algorithms for any dataset. There are three categories of feature selection techniques: filter based, wrapper based and embedded methods. Studies have depicted that the wrapper methods performs better compared to filter and embedded methods [4, 5]. Classification algorithms can be either supervised or unsupervised based on the learning mechanism. Supervised learning is implemented by set of labels defined prior in the training set. The function is mapped for new unseen data to predict the labels. Few examples are Discriminative learning, Artificial Neural Network, Bagging, Boosting, Na\u00efve Bayes, Kernel-based classifiers, Nearest Neighbour algorithm, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and other ensemble of classifiers. Whereas unsupervised learning identifies the missing or hidden patterns in unlabelled data without any labels. They are commonly used for dimensionality reduction of feature space. The unsupervised ensembles include clustering approaches, self-organization maps (SOM), hidden Markov models (HMM) and adaptive resonance theory (ART) [7].\nIn this study, a hybrid NeuroSVM model is developed for classification of liver patients using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Further, the hybrid model is implemented as a user friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) in R. The GUI can be readily utilized by doctors and medical practitioners as a screening tool for liver disease.\n2. Literature Review Health care and medicine handles huge data on daily basis. This data comprises of information about\nthe patients, diagnosis reports and medical images. It is important to utilize this information to decipher a decision support system. To achieve this it is important to discover and extract the knowledge domain from the raw data. It is accomplished by knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) [8]. The implementation of data mining techniques is widespread in biological domain. Different studies have been conducted for classification of liver disorders, they are discussed briefly. In a study conducted by Rajeshwari et. al. different data mining algorithm like Na\u00efve Bayes, FT Tree and KStar were implemented for analysis of liver disorder. It was found that Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm resulted with an accuracy of 96.52% for the data [9]. In another study conducted by Ramana different classification algorithms were implemented for diagnosis of liver disorder. They include Na\u00efve Bayes, C4.5, Neural Network, K-means and SVM. The performance of the algorithms was tested in different data sets. It was found that neural network classifier resulted in an accuracy of 71.59% for all the features in the liver dataset [10]. In another study conducted by Karthik et.al ANN was applied for classification followed by induction of rule set using Learn by Example (LEM) algorithm. It was followed by execution of fuzzy rules to identify different liver disease types which achieved an accuracy of 96% [11]. In another study the UCI liver dataset was used for selection of sub features based on random forest classifier with multi-layer perceptron induced [12]. Different artificial intelligence techniques were applied for the liver patient\u2019s dataset resulting in accurate predictions of liver malfunction [13, 14, 15, and 16]. Based on the review of literature, it was depicted that the past research studies have implemented different data mining techniques for classification of liver dataset. A hybrid model can be adapted to further increase the prediction accuracy of liver disease. It is followed by development of a graphical user interface would further aid the scientific community in early diagnosis of liver infection. It will provide a framework for end user application for generating promising treatment protocols.\n3. Methodology"}, {"heading": "3.1. Data Collection", "text": "The Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) was selected from UCI Machine learning repository for this study. It is a sample of the entire Indian population collected from Andhra Pradesh region. The dataset comprised of 583 instances based on ten different biological parameters. The class value was reported based on these parameters as either yes (416 cases) or no (167 cases) to represent the liver infection."}, {"heading": "3.2. Pre-processing and Feature selection", "text": "Pre-processing techniques was applied to normalize the missing values. The missing values along with their instances were replaced by null value. It was followed by feature selection to identify relevant attribute for classification. Feature selection was performed using both filter and wrapper methods. Initially the attributes having more than 70% correlation was removed from the dataset by correlation analysis. It was followed by feature selection using the library \u2018Boruta\u2019 in R. The algorithm was implemented on the basis of random forest for estimating the importance of different features in a dataset [17]."}, {"heading": "3.3. Randomization and splitting of dataset", "text": "The features selected in the preceding step were approved to develop classification models. Initially the dataset was randomized to obtain an arbitrary permutated sample. It was followed by\nsplitting of the dataset into training (70% of the dataset) and test (30%) sets. Training set comprised of 389 instances and test set included the remaining 194 instances."}, {"heading": "3.4. Classification algorithms", "text": "Different data mining algorithms like Na\u00efve Bayes, Bagging, Random forest and Support vector machine (SVM) were implemented in R platform for classification. R is a popular statistical computing framework for performing data mining experiments. A 10-fold cross validation was performed for each of this algorithm. The algorithms are briefly discussed below: 3.4.1. Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier: It is based on the Bayes theorem of conditional probability. The\nalgorithm assumes that each attribute contributes to the total outcome independent of other attributes [18].\n3.4.2. Bagging: They are applied for decision trees to reduce the rate of overfitting. Sampling\nand replacement is employed to generate a new training set from the given input training set. The bootstrap sample obtained is fitted with models using voting scheme for classification. The algorithm is considered as an averaging scheme for random decision trees. The algorithm was developed by Breiman [19].\n3.4.3. Random Forest: They are classifiers that construct decision trees for training input. A\nrandom value is assigned as range to feature space for splitting the tree. Based on the training ensemble class value is predicted as the modal value of distinct tree. The algorithm was implemented by Breiman [20]. The algorithm is used for ranking the features by estimating out-of-bag error. It is followed by computing of important score for each feature.\n3.4.4. Support Vector Machine: They are kernel based supervised classifier developed by\nVapnik [21]. A hyperplane is constructed in high dimensional space defined by vector having a constant dot product. The feature space is mapped to the hyperplane of nonlinear space using kernel function. The training optimized to the maximum margin hyperplane constitutes the support vectors. These vectors define an ideal linear hyperplane for classifying the instances."}, {"heading": "3.5.
