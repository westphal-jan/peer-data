For example, the idea of a fuzzy set has been proposed for some time but it has been rejected by others (e.g., a number which is already known as a doublet or more positive sense). In fact, if the concept of a fuzzy set was not included in any of its functions, the idea of a fuzzy set would have been rejected. Therefore, the concept of a fuzzy set has not been mentioned in any literature. A few examples include this idea of a fuzzy set and a fuzzy set.

Introduction\nIn real world problem every system contains uncertainty which may not be avoided. Traditionally these uncertainties have been handled by using probabilistic approach. Due to the involvement of linguistic variables and imprecise parameters in the system, it may be very difficult to get large number of experimental or observed data. In this context, a great philosopher (Zadeh, 1965) introduced the concept of fuzzy which may help to manage uncertainty and reduce the difficulty of availability of large number of data. Further the fuzzy set theory has been extensively used by various authors viz.(Chakraverty S. and Nayak S., 2013; Dubois D., 1980; Hanss Michael, 2005; Klir, 1997; Nayak S. and Chakraverty S., 2013; Zimmermann HJ., 1991). Recently, (Nayak S. and Chakraverty S., 2013) has developed a transformation method and modified fuzzy numbers into crisp form. This transformation has been used in various problems and the uncertain solution has been investigated.\nFrom the above literature it has been revealed that only one membership function has been used for the each element and there may be some extension. The Newtonian philosophy viz. \u201cEvery action has equal and opposite reaction\u201d may give us some idea about the involvement of some other membership function in addition with the membership function used in fuzzy set. The law of nature shows that if there is positive then by default some negative. So, in view of this we have introduced another membership function and the modified fuzzy number is named as Pseudo fuzzy set.\nThe above concept of pseudo fuzzy set has been systematically presented in the following sections. In the second section the development of Pseudo fuzzy and various properties have been discussed. Further in third section Pseudo fuzzy number have also been introduced.\n2. Pseudo Fuzzy set and its property\nUncertainty involve in almost every system which may be vague or imprecise value. In real world problem, every system has uncertainty. The uncertainty may be probabilistic or nonprobabilistic (i.e. imprecise or vague). These imprecise or vague uncertainties are considered as fuzzy, where a fuzzy set is a pair of element and its membership function. The fuzzy set X ~ may be defined as ]}1,0[,|),{( ~\n xx xxX  . But as we see in more details, we find that there\ninvolve another membership function ]0,1[: Xx .\nUncertainty may be divided into negative and positive. Nothing is perfect. If we consider the effect as positive then the cause may be assumed as negative is positive then by default there is some negative which may balance or unbalance the system that may not be avoided. If positive\neffect has membership function ]1,0[: Xx then negative effect (cause) has membership\nfunction ]0,1[: Xx .\nIf we study only positive part then we may not define the system. We have to study the negative impact.\nIn view of the above we may now define a system as a triplet ( xxx  ,, ) where\n]}0,1[],1,0[|{ ~\n xxxX \nIn this regard some property may be written as\nProperty\ni) ]1,0[],1,0[  xx \nii) 1,1  xx \niii) 20  xx \nAccordingly we may define now following three cases\na) 10  xx \nb) 1 xx \nc) 21  xx \nExample\nCold Fever\nWhen a person is affected by cold fever, then we may see that temperature of the body rises as well as body feels cold inside. Further it may be seen from the case study that when the body temperature rises i.e. for high fever we feel colder for this type of cold fever. So from this we may see that the hotness and coldness occurs simultaneously and so membership functions should have been defined for hotness and coldness accordingly.\nHere,  correspond the hotness of the body and correspond the coldness felt by the\nbody, where ]1,0[ and ]0,1[ .\n3. Pseudo fuzzy number\nDepending upon the nature of the uncertainty Pseudo Fuzzy Set may be classified as follows.\n(i) Dependent Pseudo Fuzzy Set\nIn this case, both the membership functions are complement to each other. Let us consider Xx be an arbitrary element of pseudo fuzzy set X and  and  are\nthe membership functions then 1 xx  .\nThe dependent Pseudo Triangular Fuzzy Number (PTFN) may be represented as follows\n   \n   \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\ncx\ncxb bc\nxc\nbxa ab\nax\nax\nx\n,0\n,\n,\n,0\n\n   \n   \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\ncx\ncxb bc\nxb\nbxa ab\nbx\nax\nx\n,1\n,\n,\n,1\n\n(ii) Independent Pseudo Fuzzy Set\nIn this case, both the membership functions are complement to each other. Let us consider Xx be an arbitrary element of pseudo fuzzy set X and  and  are\nthe membership functions then 10  xx  or 20  xx  .\nThe independent Pseudo Triangular Fuzzy Number (PTFN) may be represented as follows\n   \n   \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\ncx\ncxb bc\nxc\nbxa ab\nax\nax\nx\n,0\n,\n,\n,0\n\n   \n   \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\ncx\ncxb bc\ncx\nbxa ab\nxa\nax\nx\n,0\n,\n,\n,0\n\nReferences\nChakraverty S. and Nayak S.
