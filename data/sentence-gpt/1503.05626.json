Key words: English-to-Korean machine translation, phrase, machine-readable dictionary\n1. INTRODUCTION We live in an information society. The IT age offers easy access to variety of information in English. But the language barrier interferes with this access. The attempts to remove this barrier by developing the machine translation systems from English to Korean have been made in the D.P.R.K. since 1990s. However, the translation quality of English-to-Korean machine translation (EKMT) system fails to satisfy the users\u2019 needs.\nThe major reason lies in the several difficulties, which bring about the ambiguities in parsing and selecting the correct Korean language, due to the differences between English and Korean, so overcoming these difficulties is the key point for the success of EKMT system development.\nIn this paper, I am going to discuss one method to solve this problem by applying English-Korean phrase database approach, that is, how to build the phrase database and how to apply to it to the MT system.\n2. WHAT IS PHRASE UNIT?\nThe term \u201cphrase unit\u201d may sound like a new concept in EKMT development. In general, MT system uses several linguistic databases such as dictionaries, parsing rules,\nseveral kinds of corpus and so on. Here, the dictionary, as the basic linguistic database, refers to the machine-readable dictionary, which is used at several steps in the process of MT, such as morphologic analysis, POS (Part of Speech) tagging, parsing, and synthesizing process. And the parsing rules have been built by the developers as the linguistic database for analyzing structure of the input sentences, which is the main process of MT, and they are of little difference depending on the translation methods of the MT systems.\nThe general tendency in EKMT system development is that the system, no matter what methods it uses, still fails to overcome inaccuracy in its parsing and translating numerous English phrases only with the machine-readable dictionaries and the built-in parsing rules, and this leads to structural and semantic ambiguities, causing poor translation result.\nFor example, according to the conventional parsing rules and dictionaries, the English phrase \u201ccall in the loan\u201d as in \u201cThe bank can call in the loan at any time.\u201d is interpreted literally as it means \u201cvisit loan\u201d. This doesn\u2019t make any sense. The phrasal meaning of \u201ccall in the loan\u201d is actually \u201cto officially tell someone to pay back money you lent them\u201d, which illustrates the limitation of the standard parsing rules and machine dictionaries.\nTake one more example. The English verb phrase \u201ctake it as read\u201d in \u201cIt isn\u2019t official yet, but you can take it as read that you\u2019ve got the contract\u201d must also be parsed and translated as one part of sentence which means \u201cto feel certain that something is true although no one has told you it is true\u201d. But if this phrase is parsed in separate words as \u201ctake\u201d, \u201cit\u201d, \u201cas\u201d, and \u201cread\u201d, it causes the POS tagging error, parsing error, and even Korean synthesizing error, and as a result the output semantically contradicts the intention of the writer.\nA lot of examples like these can be found in English language. As one method to solve these problems, we have introduced the idea of bilingual phrase database for structure and word sense disambiguation. In Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, the word \u201cPHRASE\u201d is defined as a group of words that together have a particular meaning, especially when they express the meaning well in a few words.\nAnd in Oxford Advanced Learner\u2019s Dictionary, it is defined as follows; - a group of words without a finite verb, especially one that forms part of a sentence - a group of words which have a particular meaning when used together As we can see above the definitions of the word \u201cphrase\u201d in the dictionaries, the English phrase can be defined as a grammatical unit and a fixed expression. In other words it is a string of words that forms one grammatical unit, usually within a clause or sentence, and a string of words that is used together and has an idiomatic meaning. And many ambiguities are caused by these English phrases, because they are not successfully parsed with the standard grammatical parsing rules.\nBased on the definitions of the English phrase given above, the phrase unit that is to be built in EKMT phrase database can be defined as the word combination which functions as one part of sentence with one semantic unit, and its range covers from noun and verb to clause and sentence.\nIts meaning is not the semantic sum of the meanings of the individual words which the phrase consists of, and the Korean equivalent for a given phrase unit will also be in the form of phrase unit in the Korean language. In other words this phrase unit refers to the language unit that cannot be parsed or translated with accuracy by the standard grammar rules. Therefore it must be treated as a single unit like an independent word for parsing and translating.\nWe can classify the phrase unit into various forms such as NOUN phrase unit, VERB phrase unit, ADJECTIVE phrase unit, PREPOSITION phrase unit and so on. Larger units like sentence and clause can be involved into the phrase unit, because structural and semantic ambiguities caused by idiomaticity of some English sentences (Time flies like an arrow, Good bye, How are you?, Happy new year etc.) and clauses (cannot say for certain, as if in a dream, all the indications are that\u2026, etc.) constitute major reason for parsing failure and poor translation result.\n3. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THE PHRASE DATABASE?\nThe major benefit of the phrase database, in a nutshell, is that it greatly contributes to overcoming the deficiency of the existing MT system.\nFirstly, the phrase database enlarges the language database, and thus makes the MT translation close to the human translation.\nIt is self-evident that when the bilingual database is ready, it is easy to translate one language into another. Many English words have multiple meanings, and so do the Korean words. It is very difficult to choose the right Korean equivalent with the exact meaning for a certain English word in machine translation. As a solution to this difficulty we have built several language corpora such as collocation corpus, sense corpus etc. The phrase database, along with these corpora, will ensure much more accuracy in the translation result.\nSecondly, the phrase database decreases the dependence on the parsing system based on the POS (Part of Speech) tagging.\nMany machine translation programs are rule-based, and it means the accurate POS tagging has a great deal of impact on the process of machine translation, such as parsing, transferring, and synthesizing. The wrong POS tagging will inevitably result in unsatisfactory parsing performance, and even though the POS tagging is successful, the phrase unit will not be parsed precisely due to its characteristics of idiomaticity and non-grammaticalness.\nThirdly, the phrase database ensures flexibility in processing certain phrases. Before we applied the phrase database, it took long time to parse the English phrase and to choose its Korean equivalents. As we have seen above, the phrase unit includes many idiomatic phrases (call in the loan, take it as read, cannot say for a certain) and sentences like proverbs (Time flies like an arrow), conversational talks (How are you, Good bye!), which are not easy to translate correctly into Korean. In the each process of machine translation such as POS tagging, parsing, and so on, it is usual that the machine translation system is burdened with these phrase units for their non-standard structures and idiomatic Korean equivalents.\nAnd finally, the phrase database makes it easier to enrich the large language database in terms\nof time an In gen translation 150 thous years, and estimate h work to b of time it build the result turn\nThe fo contributi\nThe fi In set\nbuilding c database. any user can be ea English p the phrase\nBelow\nThe E The P\nthat the en The ta Each between E the colon\nd efforts. eral, it tak system.

A\nsan\u201d\nof part of nd when\na sentence is input into the MT system, these information are used in every processes of translation. But these translation patterns are fixed patterns, and these patterns cannot be applied to the phrase unit.\nEach language database has its own advantage and disadvantage. The machine-readable dictionary uses the structurally fixed translation patterns that enable the system to process diverse linguistic phenomena of English sentences inclusively. But it is weak at the description of the idiomatic and non-grammatical expressions that are commonly used in English sentences. By comparison, the phrase database has no restrictive rules on description of all kinds of English expressions including idiomatic and non-grammatical ones. But it can be applied only when the matching condition is provided. In other words it has a lack of ability to process the transformed linguistic phenomena of English language, particularly when the verbs are in passive forms.\n5. WHAT DOES THE PHRASE DATABASE INCLUDE?\nThe principles that we adhere to building the phrase database are as follows: Firstly, we have not included the English phrases that can be parsed by the standard grammatical parsing rules. It is because the idea of using phrase database in machine translation programme is not for the standard grammatical expressions but for the idiomatic and non-grammatical ones (e.g. take it as read) that cannot be parsed by the grammar rules.\nSecondly, we have included the English phrases that have the Korean equivalents different from the parsing result.\nIn machine translation programme, parsing is very important step, but it is not for its own sake. Its aim is to output the semantically correct Korean sentences. So, if the expression is correctly parsed by the standard grammatical rules and the semantic sum of individual words is equivalent enough to its Korean language unit, it is not necessary to include that kind of phrases in the phrase database. But the English word like \u201cnumber\u201d which represents amount or quantity is used as a phrase for \u201ca number of\u201d and its Korean language is semantically different from its sum of \u201ca\u201d, \u201cnumber\u201d, and \u201cof\u201d. So, the phrases like \u201ca number of\u201d should be the target component of the phrase database.\nThirdly, we have included the phrases that have the standard translation patterns. As mentioned in the previous section, the machine-readable dictionary of the machine translation program \u201cRyongnamsan\u201d (2.0) is the language database that contains the fixed translation patterns of the words and their Korean language according to the parts of speech. Particularly, as for the verbs, they are divided into 41 patterns, of which the verbs from VP1 to VP6 are intransitive verbs, and the verbs from VP7 to VP41 are transitive verbs, and the parsing and synthesizing are carried out according to these patterns. And the words like nouns and adjectives have their own patterns.\nFourthly, we have included the English noun combinations in which each component functions as the multi-parts of speech, such as the word combination \u201ccommand control\u201d.\nIt is important to parse the base noun phrase (BNP) correctly in machine translation. Especially, the word combination as noun often causes ambiguity in POS tagging because the noun word in English has the multi parts of speech, such as verb and noun. For example, the word combination \u201ccommand control\u201d may be one entry as a noun in the machine readable dictionary. But in the sentence \u201cThe trap command controls signals coming into this program while it is running\u201d the word \u201ccontrol\u201d must be POS tagged as a verb. If not, the parsing will not turn out to be successful. It is common particularly in the word combinations which consist of two words such as command display, process check, call graph, system need, file request, session end, system support, analysis list, execute permission, terminate module, include file, enable condition, etc. Thus, such word combinations as noun phrases must be included in the phrase database, and at the morphological analyzing step, they are separated into individual words for POS tagging, after which they are processed based on the phrase database.\nAnd finally, we have included the conversational sentences and idiomatic phrases in the phrase database.\nMany conversational sentences (Good morning, How are you?), proverbs (Time flies like an arrow.) and idiomatic phrases (call in the loan, take it as read, cannot say for a certain) cannot be parsed by the standard parsing rules, and so are the Korean language for them. But they can be processed on the phrase database.\n6. WHEN CAN WE APPLY THE PHRASE DATABASE TO MT SYSTEM?\nAfter building the phrase database according to the above principles, the next step is how to apply the phrase database to machine translation system.\nFirst of all, it is important to set the applying points where the phrase database should be used. At early stage, this database was used only at the synthesizing step for the disambiguation in the selected Korean language. But its efficiency was not as desired, and the language resources were not fully used. In other words, this was a waste of the language resources. More effective method should be developed.\nThe phrase units in this database, as above described, consists of three parts, such as English word string, grammatical information and Korean word string, and these formalization will enable the phrase units to be convertible into the parsing rules.\nSo we converted the phrase units into the parsing rules and applied them at the parsing step as well. Though these parsing rules from phrase database can be matched only when the whole phrase unit is matched with the phrase of the input sentence, it processes the idiomatic and non-grammatical unit as one linguistic unit so that it can reduce the structural ambiguity.\nWe applied the phrase database at two steps - first step for one-to-one match and second step for extending match.\n- First Step (One-to-One match) Let\u2019s compare the following two tree structures of the example sentence.\ne.g.: You can take it as read\nFig.2.
