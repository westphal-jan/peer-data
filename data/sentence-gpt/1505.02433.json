Thanks to long-term efforts of experts, crowd sourcing, and even machine learning techniques, several web-scale knowledge repositories, such as\nWordnet1, Freebase2 and NELL3, have been constructed. WordNet (Miller, 1995) and Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2007; Bollacker et al., 2008) follow the RDF format that represents each belief as a triplet, i.e. \u3008head entity, relation, tail entity\u3009. NELL (Carlson et al., 2010a) extends each triplet with a relation mention which is a snatch of extracted free text to indicate the corresponding relation. Here we take a belief recorded in NELL as an example: \u3008city : caroline, citylocatedinstate, stateorprovince : maryland, county and state of\u3009 , in which county and state of is the mention between the head entity city : caroline and the tail entity stateorprovince : maryland, to indicate the relation citylocatedinstate. In some cases, NELL also provides the confidence of each belief automatically learnt by machines.\nAlthough colossal quantities of beliefs have been gathered, state-of-the-art work (West et al., 2014) reports that our knowledge bases are far from complete. For instance, nearly 97% of people in the Freebase database have no records about their parents, whereas we can still find clues as to their immediate family in many cases by searching on the web and looking up their Wiki.\nTo populate the incomplete knowledge repositories, scientists either compare the performance of relation extraction between two named entities on manually annotated text datasets, such as ACE4 and MUC5, or look for effective approaches for improving the accuracy of link prediction within the knowledge graphs constructed by the repositories without using extra free texts.\nRecently, studies on text-based knowledge\n1http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ 2https://www.freebase.com/ 3http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/rtw/ 4http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/\ntests/ace/ 5http://www.itl.nist.gov/iaui/894.02/ relatedprojects/muc/\nar X\niv :1\n50 5.\n02 43\n3v 4\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 2\nM ay\n2 01\n5\ncompletion have benefited significantly from a paradigm known as Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction (Mintz et al., 2009) (DSRE), which bridges the gap between structured knowledge bases and unstructured free texts. It alleviates the labor of manual annotation by means of automatically aligning each triplet \u3008h, r, t\u3009 from knowledge bases to the corresponding relation mention m in free texts. However state-of-the-art research (Fan et al., 2014a) points out that DSRE still suffers from the problem of sparse and noisy features. Although Fan et al. (2014a) fix the issue to some extent by making use of low-dimensional matrix factorization, their approach was identified as unable to handle large-scale datasets.\nFortunately, knowledge embedding techniques (Bordes et al., 2011; Bordes et al., 2014) enable us to encode the high-dimensional sparse features into low-dimensional distributed representations. A simple but effective model is TransE (Bordes et al., 2013), which trains a vector representation for each entity and relation in large-scale knowledge bases without considering any text information. Even though Weston et al. (Weston et al., 2013), Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2014a) and Fan et al. (Fan et al., 2015a) broaden this field by adding word embeddings, there is still no comprehensive and elegant model that can integrate such largescale heterogeneous resources to satisfy multiple subtasks of knowledge completion including entity inference, relation prediction and triplet classification.\nTherefore, the contribution of this paper is a proposed novel embedding model which measures the probability of each belief \u3008h, r, t,m\u3009 in largescale repositories. It breaks through the limitation of heterogeneous data, and establishes the connection between structured knowledge graphs and unstructured free texts. The distributed representations for entities (h and t), relations (r), as well as the words in relation mentions (m) are simultaneously learnt within the uniform framework of the probabilistic belief embedding (PBE) we propose. Knowledge completion is facilitated by means of simple vector operations to discover new beliefs. Given an imperfect belief, we can not only infer the missing entities, predict the unknown relations, but tell the plausibility of the belief as well, just by means of the learnt vector representations of available data. To prove the effectiveness and the scalability of PBE, we perform extensive\nexperiments with multiple tasks, including entity inference, relation prediction and triplet classification, for knowledge completion, and evaluate both our model and other cutting-edge approaches with appropriate metrics on several large-scale datasets which contain hundreds of thousands of beliefs from WordNet, Freebase and NELL. Detailed comparison results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches with significant improvements identified."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Embedding-based inference models usually design various scoring functions fr(h, t) to measure the plausibility of a triplet \u3008h, r, t\u3009. The lower the dissimilarity of the scoring function fr(h, t) is, the higher the compatibility of the triplet will be.\nUnstructured (Bordes et al., 2013) is a naive model which exploits the occurrence information of the head and the tail entities without considering the relation between them. It defines a scoring function ||h \u2212 t||, and this model obviously can not discriminate between a pair of entities involving different relations. Therefore, Unstructured is commonly regarded as the baseline approach.\nDistance Model (SE) (Bordes et al., 2011) uses a pair of matrices (Wrh,Wrt), to characterize a relation r. The dissimilarity of a triplet is calculated by ||Wrhh\u2212Wrtt||1. As identified by Socher et al. (Socher et al., 2013), the separating matrices Wrh and Wrt weaken the capability of capturing correlations between entities and corresponding relations, despite the model taking the relations into consideration.\nSingle Layer Model, proposed by Socher et al. (Socher et al., 2013) thus aims to alleviate the shortcomings of the Distance Model by means of the non-linearity of a single layer neural network g(Wrhh + Wrtt + br), in which g = tanh. The linear output layer then gives the scoring function: uTr g(Wrhh +Wrtt + br).\nBilinear Model (Sutskever et al., 2009; Jenatton et al., 2012) is another model that tries to fix the issue of weak interaction between the head and tail entities caused by the Distance Model with a relation-specific bilinear form: fr(h, t) = hTWrt.\nNeural Tensor Network (NTN) (Socher et al., 2013) designs a general scoring function: fr(h, t) = u T r g(h\nTWrt + Wrhh + Wrtt + br), which combines the Single Layer and Bilinear\nModels. This model is more expressive as the second-order correlations are also considered in the non-linear transformation function, but the computational complexity is rather high.\nTransE (Bordes et al., 2013) is a canonical model different from all the other prior arts, which embeds relations into the same vector space as entities by regarding the relation r as a translation from h to t, i.e. h+r = t. It works well on beliefs with the ONE-TO-ONE mapping property but performs badly with multi-mapping beliefs. Given a series of facts associated with a ONE-TO-MANY relation r, e.g. \u3008h, r, t1\u3009, \u3008h, r, t2\u3009, ..., \u3008h, r, tm\u3009, TransE tends to represent the embeddings of entities on the MANY-side as extremely close to each other with very little discrimination.\nTransM (Fan et al., 2014b) exploits the structure of the whole knowledge graph, and adjusts the learning rate, which is specific to each relation based on the multiple mapping property of the relation.\nTransH (Wang et al., 2014b) is, to the best knowledge of the authors, the state of the art approach. It improves TransE by modeling a relation as a hyperplane, which makes it more flexible with regard to modeling beliefs with multimapping properties.\nDue to the diverse feature spaces between unstructured texts and structured beliefs, one key challenge of connecting natural language and knowledge is to project the features into the same space and to merge them together for knowledge completion. Fan et al. (Fan et al., 2015a) have recently proposed JRME to jointly learn the embedding representations for both relations and mentions in order to predict unknown relations between entities in NELL. However, the functionality of their latest method is limited to the relation prediction task (see section 5.3), as the correlations between entities and relations are ignored. Therefore, we desire a comprehensive model that can simultaneously consider entities, relations and even the relation mentions, and can integrate the heterogeneous resources to support multiple subtasks of knowledge completion, such as entity inference, relation prediction and triplet classification."}, {"heading": "3 Model", "text": "The intuition of the subsequent theory is that: Not each belief we have learnt, i.e.\n\u3008head entity, relation, tail entity,mention\u3009 abbreviated as \u3008h, r, t,m\u3009, is perfect and complete enough (Fan et al., 2015b). We thus explore modeling the probability of each belief, i.e. Pr(h, r, t,m). It is assumed that Pr(h, r, t,m) is collaboratively influenced by Pr(h|r, t), Pr(t|h, r) and Pr(r|h, t,m), where Pr(h|r, t) stands for the conditional probability of inferring the head entity h given the relation r and the tail entity t, Pr(t|h, r) represents the conditional probability of inferring the tail entity t given the head entity h and the relation r, and Pr(r|h, t,m) denotes the conditional probability of predicting the relation r between the head entity h and the tail entity t with the relation mention m extracted from free texts. Therefore, we define that the probability of a belief equals to the geometric mean of Pr(h|r, t)Pr(r|h, t,m)Pr(t|h, r) as shown in the subsequent equation,\nPr(h, r, t,m) = 3 \u221a Pr(h|r, t)Pr(r|h, t,m)Pr(t|h, r).\n(1) We assume that we have a certain repository \u2206, such as WordNet, which contains thousands of beliefs validated by experts. The learning object is intuitively set to maximize Lmax, where\nLmax = \u220f\n\u3008h,r,t,m\u3009\u2208\u2206\nPr(h, r, t,m). (2)\nIn most cases, we can automatically build much larger but imperfect knowledge bases as well via crowdsouring (Freebase) and machine learning techniques (NELL). However, each belief of NELL has a confidence-weighted score c to indicate its plausibility to some extent. Therefore, we propose an alternative goal which aims to minimize Lmin, in which\nLmin = \u220f\n\u3008h,r,t,m,c\u3009\u2208\u2206\n1 2 [Pr(h, r, t,m)\u2212 c]2. (3)\nTo facilitate the optimization progress, we prefer using the log likelihood ofLmax andLmin, and the learning targets can be further processed as follows,\narg max h,r,t,m\nlogLmax\n= arg max h,r,t,m \u2211 \u3008h,r,t,m\u3009\u2208\u2206 logPr(h, r, t,m)\n= arg max h,r,t,m \u2211 \u3008h,r,t,m\u3009\u2208\u2206 1 3 [logPr(h|r, t)\n+ logPr(r|h, t,m) + logPr(t|h, r)];\n(4)\narg min h,r,t,m\nlogLmin\n= arg min h,r,t,m \u2211 \u3008h,r,t,m,c\u3009\u2208\u2206 1 2 [logPr(h, r, t,m)\u2212 log c]2\n= arg min h,r,t,m \u2211 \u3008h,r,t,m,c\u3009\u2208\u2206 1 2 {1 3 [logPr(h|r, t)\n+ logPr(r|h, t,m) + logPr(t|h, r)]\u2212 log c}2. (5)\nThe advantage of the conversions above is that we can separate the factors out, compared with Equation (1). Therefore, the remaining challenge is to identify the approaches to use to model Pr(h|r, t), Pr(r|h, t,m) and Pr(t|h, r). Pr(r|h, t,m) leverages the evidences from two different resources to predict the relation. If the concurrence of the two entities (h and t) in knowledge bases is independent of the appearance of the relation mention m from free texts, we can factorize Pr(r|h, t,m) as shown by Equation (6):\nPr(r|h, t,m) = Pr(r|h, t)Pr(r|m). (6)\nWe then need to consider formulating Pr(h|r, t), Pr(r|h, t), Pr(t|h, r) and Pr(r|m), respectively.\nFigure 1(a) illustrates the traditional way of recording knowledge as triplets. The triplets \u3008h, r, t\u3009 can construct a knowledge graph in which entities (h and t) are nodes and the relation (r) between them is a directed edge from the head entity (h) to the tail entity (t). This kind of symbolic representation, whilst being very efficient for storing, is not flexible enough for statistical learning\napproaches (Bordes et al., 2011). However, once each of the elements, including entities and relations in the knowledge repository, are projected into the same embedding space, we can use:\nD(h, r, t) = \u2212||h + r\u2212 t||+ \u03b1, (7)\nwhich is a simple vector operation to measure the distance between h + r and t, where h, r and t are encoded in d dimensional vectors, and \u03b1 is the bias parameter. To estimate the conditional probability of appearing t given h and r, i.e. Pr(t|h, r), however, we need to adopt the softmax function as follows,\nPr(t|h, r) = exp D(h,r,t)\u2211\nt\u2032\u2208Et exp D(h,r,t\u2032)\n, (8)\nwhere Et is the set of tail entities which contains all possible entities t\u2032 appearing in the tail position. Similarly, we can regard Pr(h|r, t) and Pr(r|h, t) as\nPr(h|r, t) = exp D(h,r,t)\u2211\nh\u2032\u2208Eh exp D(h\u2032,r,t)\n(9)\nand\nPr(r|h, t) = exp D(h,r,t)\u2211\nr\u2032\u2208R exp D(h,r\u2032,t)\n, (10)\nin which Eh is the set of head entities which contains all possible entities h\u2032 appearing in the head position, and R is the set of all candidate relations r\u2032.\nIn addition to this, Figure 1(c) shows that free texts can provide fruitful contexts between two recognized entities, but the one-hot6 feature space\n6http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot\nis rather high and sparse. Therefore, we can also project each words in relation \u2019mentions\u2019 into the same embedding space of entities and relations. To measure the similarity between the mention m and the corresponding relation r, we adopt the inner product of their embeddings as shown by Equation (11),\nF (r,m) = WT\u03c6(m)r + \u03b2, (11)\nwhere W is the matrix of Rnv\u00d7d containing nv vocabularies with d dimensional embeddings, \u03c6(m) is the sparse one-hot representation of the mention indicating the absence or presence of words, r \u2208 Rd is the embedding of relation r, and \u03b2 is the bias parameter. Similar to Equations (8), (9) and (10), the conditional probability of predicting relation r given mention m, i.e. Pr(r|m) can be defined as,\nPr(r|m) = exp F (r,m)\u2211\nr\u2032\u2208R exp F (r\u2032,m)\n. (12)\nOverall, this section has shown that we can model the probability of a belief via jointly embedding the entities, relations and even the words in mentions, as demonstrated by Figure 1(b)."}, {"heading": "4 Algorithm", "text": "To search for the optimal solutions of Equation (4) and (5), we can use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to update the embeddings of entities, relations and words of mentions in iterative fashion. However, it is computationally intensive to calculate the normalization terms in Pr(h|r, t), Pr(r|h, t), Pr(t|h, r) and Pr(r|m) according to the definitions made by Equation (8), (9), (10) and (12) respectively. For instance, if we directly calculate the value of Pr(h|r, t) for just one belief, tens of thousands expD(h\n\u2032,r,t) need to be re-valued, as there are tens of thousands of candidate entities h\u2032 in Eh. Inspired by the work of Mikolov et al. (Mikolov et al., 2013), we have developed an efficient approach that adopts the negative sampling technique to approximate the conditional probability functions, i.e. Equations (8), (9), (10) and (12), by being transformed to binary classification problems as shown respectively by the subsequent equations,\nlogPr(h|r, t) \u2248 logPr(1|h, r, t) + k\u2211\ni=1\nEh\u2032iPr(h\u2032\u2208Eh) logPr(0|h \u2032 i, r, t),\n(13)\nlogPr(t|h, r) \u2248 logPr(1|h, r, t)\n+ k\u2211 i=1 Et\u2032iPr(t\u2032\u2208Et) logPr(0|h, r, t \u2032 i),\n(14)\nlogPr(r|h, t) \u2248 logPr(1|h, r, t)\n+ k\u2211 i=1 Er\u2032iPr(r\u2032\u2208R) logPr(0|h, r \u2032 i, t),\n(15)\nlogPr(r|m) \u2248 logPr(1|r,m)\n+ k\u2211 i=1 Er\u2032iPr(r\u2032\u2208R) logPr(0|r \u2032 i,m),\n(16)\nwhere we sample k negative beliefs and discriminate them from the positive case. For the simple binary classification problems mentioned above, we choose the logistic function with the offset shown in Equation (17) to estimate the probability that the given triplet \u3008h, r, t\u3009 is correct:\nPr(1|h, r, t) = 1 1 + exp\u2212D(h,r,t) + , (17)\nand with the offset \u03b7 shown in Equation (18) to tell the probability of the occurrence of r and m:\nPr(1|r,m) = 1 1 + exp\u2212F (r,m) + \u03b7.

The NELL (Mitchell et al., 2015) designed and maintained by Carnegie Mellon University is an outstanding system which runs 24 hours/day and never stops learning the beliefs on the Web. We use a relatively small dataset NELL-50K which contains about 50 thousand confidence-weighted beliefs from NELL. Each belief of NELL-50K has a relation mention m in addition to a triplet \u3008h, r, t\u3009. WN-100K is made by experts, and owns only 11\nkinds of relations but much more entities. Therefore, it is a sparse repository in which fewer entities have connections. The third dataset (FB500K7) we adopt is released by Bordes et al. (Bordes et al., 2013). It is a large crowdsourcing dataset extracted from Freebase, in which each belief is a triplet without a confidence score.\nAs the words in relation mentions will be further concerned in the relation prediction subtask, we also show the vocabulary size of each dataset. However, WN-100K and FB-500K only contain triplets as beliefs, so their vocabulary sizes are null.\nFor the triplet classification subtask, the head or the tail entity can be randomly replaced with another one to produce a negative training example. But in order to build much tough validation and testing datasets, we constrain that the picked entity should once appear at the same position.

Finally, we locate the ground-truth triplet and record its rank. This whole procedure runs in the same way when replacing the tail entity, so that we can gain the mean results. We use two metrics, i.e. Mean Rank and Mean Hit@10 (the proportion of ground truth triplets that rank in Top 10), to measure the performance. However, the results measured by those metrics are relatively raw, as the procedure above tends to generate false negative triplets.
