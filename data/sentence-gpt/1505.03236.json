Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) is the global optimization technique, which avoids trapping in local optimum solution. In this paper, a novel hybrid data clustering approach using Flower Pollination Algorithm and K-Means (FPAKM) is proposed.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "Data clustering [4] [6] is an unsupervised learning technique in which class labels are not known in advance. The purpose of clustering is to partition a set of objects into clusters or groups so that the objects within the cluster are more similar to each other, while objects in different clusters are far away from each other. In past decades, many nature-inspired evolutionary algorithms have been developed for solving most engineering design optimization problems, which are highly nonlinear, involving many design variables and complex constraints. These metaheuristic algorithms are attracted very much because of the global search capability and take less time to solve real world problems. Nature-inspired algorithms [2] [3] imitate the behaviours of the living things in the nature, so they are also called as Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms.\nEvolutionary algorithms (EAs) were the initial stage of such optimization methods [35]. Genetic Algorithm (GA) [6] and Simulated Annealing (SA) [7] are popular examples for EAs. In the early 1970s, Genetic algorithm was developed by John Holland, which inspired by biological evolution such as reproduction, mutation, crossover and selection. Simulated annealing (SA) was developed from inspiration by annealing in metallurgy, a technique involving heating and cooling of a material to increase the size of its crystals and reduce their defects.\nThe rising body of Swarm Intelligence(SI) [2] [3] metaheuristic algorithms include Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [1] [5], Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) [14], Glowworm Swarm Optimization (GSO) [8], Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) [9-10], the Bees Algorithm [31], Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) [25][28-29], Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) [30] , Cuckoo Search (CS) [26-27], Firefly Algorithm (FA) [32-33] , Bat Algorithm (BA) [20] and flower pollination algorithm[19] .\nSwarm Intelligence system holds a population of solutions, which are changed through random selection and alterations of these solutions. The way, the system differs depends on the generation of new solutions, random selection procedure and candidate solution encoding technique. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was developed in 1995 by Kennedy and Eberhart simulating the social behaviour of bird flock or fish school. Ant Colony Optimization, introduced by Dorigo, imitates the food searching paths of ants in nature. Glowworm Swarm Optimization (GSO) was introduced by Krishnanand and Ghose in 2005 based on the behaviour of glow worms. Bacterial foraging optimization algorithm was developed based on the foraging behaviour of bacteria such as E.coli and M.xanthus. The Bees Algorithm was developed by Pham DT in 2005 imitating the food foraging behaviour of honey bee colonies. Artificial bee colony algorithm was developed by Karaboga, being motivated from food foraging behaviour of bee colonies. Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) was introduced in 2008 by Dan Simon inspired by biogeography, which is the study of the distribution of biological species through space and time. Cuckoo search was developed by Xin-she Yang and Subash Deb in 2009 being motivated by the brood parasitism of cuckoo species by laying their eggs in the nests of other host birds. Firefly algorithm was introduced by Xin-She Yang inspired by the flashing behaviour of fireflies. The primary principle for a firefly's flash is to act as an indicator system to draw other fireflies. Bat algorithm was developed in 2010 by Xin-She Yang based on the echolocation behaviour of microbats. Flower pollination algorithm was developed by Xin-She Yang in 2012 motivated by the pollination process of flowering plants.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some of the previous proposed research work on data clustering. K-Means algorithm and Flower Pollination algorithm is presented in Section 3 and Section 4 respectively. Then in Section 5 proposed algorithm is explained. Section 6 discusses experimental results and Section 7 concludes the paper with fewer discussions."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "Van, D.M. and A.P. Engelbrecht. (2003) [5] proposed data clustering approach using particle swarm optimization. The author proposed two approaches for data clustering. The first approach is, PSO, in which the optimal centroids are found and then these optimal centroids were used as a seed in K-means algorithm and the second approach is, the PSO was used to refine the clusters formed by K-means. The two approaches were tested and the results show that both PSO clustering techniques have much potential.\nAnt Colony Optimization (ACO) method for clustering is presented by Shelokar et al. (2004) [14]. In [14], the authors employed distributed agents that imitate the way real-life ants find the shortest path from their nest to a food source and back. The results obtained by ACO can be considered viable and is an efficient heuristic to find near-optimal cluster representation for the clustering problem.\nKao et al. (2008) [22] proposed a hybridized approach that combines PSO technique, Nelder\u2013 Mead simplex search and the K-means algorithm. The performance of K-NM-PSO is compared with PSO, NM-PSO, K-PSO and K-means clustering and it is proved that K-NM-PSO is both strong and suitable for handling data clustering.\nMaulik and Mukhopadhyay (2010) [7] also presented a simulated annealing approach to clustering. They combined their heuristic with artificial neural networks to improve solution quality and the similarity criteria, which used DB cluster validity index. Karaboga and Ozturk (2011) [15] presented a new clustering approach using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm\nwhich simulates the food foraging behaviour of a honey bee swarm. The performance is compared with PSO and other classification techniques. The simulation results show that the ABC algorithm is superior to other algorithms.\nZhang et al. (2010) [23] presented the artificial bee colony (ABC) as a state-of-the-art approach to clustering. Deb\u2019s rules are used to tackle infeasible solutions instead of the greedy selection process usually used in the ABC algorithm. When they tested their algorithm, they found very encouraging results in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.\nIn [16] (2012), X. Yan et al presented a new data clustering algorithm using hybrid artificial bee colony (HABC). The genetic algorithm crossover operator was introduced to ABC to enhance the information exchange between bees. The HABC algorithm achieved better results.\nTunchan Cura. (2012) [19] presented a new PSO approach to the data clustering and the algorithm was tested using two synthetic datasets and five real datasets. The results show that the algorithm can be applied to clustering problem with known and unknown number of clusters. Senthilnath, J., Omkar, S.N. and Mani, V. (2011) [13] presented data clustering using firefly algorithm. They measured the performance of FA with respect to supervised clustering problem and the results show that algorithm is robust and efficient.\nM.Wan and his co-authors (2012) [17] presented data clustering using Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO). The algorithm proposed by these researchers was tested on several wellknown benchmark data sets and Compared three clustering technique. The author concludes that the algorithm is effective and can be used to handle data sets with various cluster sizes, densities and multiple dimensions.\nJ. Senthilnatha, Vipul Dasb, Omkara, V. Mani, (2012) [18] proposed a new data clustering approach using Cuckoo search with levy flight. Levy flight is heavy-tailed which ensures that it covers output domain efficiently. The author concluded that the proposed algorithm is better than GA and PSO."}, {"heading": "3. K-MEANS ALGORITHM", "text": "K-Means Clustering algorithm is fast and easy to implement.

Several approaches are widely applied to data clustering so that objects within the clusters are similar and objects in different clusters are far away from each other. K-Means, is one of the familiar center based clustering algorithms since implementation is very easy and fast convergence. However, K-Means algorithm suffers from initialization, hence trapped in local optima. Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) is the global optimization technique, which avoids trapping in local optimum solution. In this paper, a novel hybrid data clustering approach using Flower Pollination Algorithm and K-Means (FPAKM) is proposed. The proposed algorithm results are compared with K-Means and FPA on eight datasets. From the experimental results, FPAKM is better than FPA and K-Means.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
