We first define a modal language to express \"I know how to guarantee phi given psi\" with a semantics not based on standard epistemic models but labelled transition systems that represent the agent's knowledge of his own abilities. A sound and complete proof system is given to capture the valid reasoning patterns about \"knowing how\" where the most important axiom suggests its compositional nature. In this paper, we examine how the theory of the agent is applied to a single agent's knowledge of what his knowledge of how to guarantee phi (or how the agent may be aware of its actions). As this theoretical model is explained in this article, the theory of the agent is based on a principle that sets a set of rules. This model describes how the agent might respond to one type of action, or more importantly, when it is in conflict with a different action (such as in a particular case where a new action is being described as \"the most common action\") and when it is in conflict with a different action (such as in a particular case where a new action is being described as \"the most common action\") and when it is in conflict with a different action (such as in a particular case where a new action is being described as \"the most common action\") and when it is in conflict with a different action (such as in a particular case where a new action is being described as \"the most common action\") and when it is in conflict with a different action (such as in a particular case where a new action is being described as \"the most common action\"). To demonstrate the principles of this principle, we demonstrate how the agent's knowledge of how to guarantee phi (or how the agent may be aware of its actions) is treated by a single action (such as in a particular case where a new action is being described as \"the most common action\") and when it is in conflict with a different action (such as in a particular case where a new action is being described as \"the most common action\") and when it is in conflict with a different action (such as in a particular case where a new action is being described as \"the most common action\") and when it is in conflict with a different action (such as in a particular case where a new action is being described as \"the most common action\")", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 25 May 2015 14:43:55 GMT  (35kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06651v1", "Under submission"], ["v2", "Thu, 4 Jun 2015 08:36:47 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06651v2", "Under submission.

The standard picture of epistemic logic usually consists of: a modal language which can express \u201can agent knows that \u03d5\u201d; a Kripke semantics incarnates the slogan \u201cknowledge (information) as elimination of uncertainty\u201d; a proof system syntactically characterizes a normal modal logic somewhere between S4 and S5 subjective to different opinions about the so-called introspection axioms. Despite the suspicions from philosophers in its early days, the past half-century has witnessed the blossom of this logical investigation of propositional knowledge with applications in epistemology, theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence, economics, and many other disciplines besides its birth place of modal logic.2\nHowever, the large body of research on epistemic logic mainly focuses on propositional knowledge expressed by \u201cknowing that \u03d5\u201d, despite the fact that in everyday life knowledge is expressed by also \u201cknowing how\u201d, \u201cknowing why\u201d, \u201cknowing what\u201d, \u201cknowing whether\u201d, and so on (knowing?X below for brevity). Linguistically, these expressions of knowledge share the common form consisting of the verb \u201cknow\u201d followed by some embedded questions.3 It is natural to assign a high-level uniform truth condition for these\n\u22c6 The author thanks Frank Veltman for his insightful comments on an earlier version of this paper. The author is also gratful to the support from NSSF key projects 12&ZD119 and 15AZX020. 1 To impatient technical readers: this rather philosophical introduction will help you to know how the formalism works in the later sections. A bit of philosophy can lead us further. 2 For an excellent survey of the early history of epistemic logic, see [3, Chapter 2]. For a contemporary comprehensive introduction to its various topics, see [4]. 3 There is a cross-lingual fact: such knowing?X sentences become meaningless if the verb \u201cknow\u201d is replaced by \u201cbelieve\u201d, e.g., I believe how to swim. This may shed some shadow on philosophers\u2019 usual conception of knowledge in terms of strengthened belief. Linguistically, this phenomenon occurs to many other verbs which can be roughly categorized using factivity, cf., e.g, [5].\nknowledge expressions in terms of knowing an answer of the corresponding question [6]. In fact, in the early days of epistemic logic, Hinttika has elaborate discussions on knowing?X and its relation with questions in terms of first-order modal logic [2], which also shapes his later work on Socratic Epistemology [7]. For example, \u201cknowing who Frank is\u201d is rendered as \u2203xK(Frank = x) in [2]. However, partly because of the then-infamous philosophical and technical issues regarding the foundation of first-order modal logic (largely due to Quine), the development of epistemic logics beyond \u201cknowing that\u201d was hindered.4 In the seminal work [10], the first-order epistemic logic is just briefly touched without specific discussion of those expressions using different embedded questions. A promising recent approach is based on inquisitive semantics where propositions may have both informative content and inquisitive content (cf. e.g.,[11]). An inquisitive epistemic logic which can handle \u201cknowing that\u201d and \u201cknowing whether\u201d is proposed in [12].\nDeparting from the linguistically motivated compositional analysis on knowing?X, some researchers took a knowing?X construction as a whole, and introduce a new modality instead of breaking it down by allowing quantifiers, equalities and other logical constants to occur freely in the language [13,14,15]. For example, \u201cknowing what a password is\u201d is rendered by \u201cKv password\u201d in [13] instead of \u2203xK password = x, where Kv is the new modality. This move seems promising since by restricting the language we may avoid some philosophical issues of first-order modal logic, retain the decidability of the logic, and focus on special logical properties of each particular knowing-?X construction at a high abstraction level. A recent line of work results from this idea [16,17,18,19,20]. Besides the evident non-nomality of the resulting logics,5 a \u2018signature\u2019 technical difficulty in such an approach is the apparent mismatch of syntax and semantics: the modal language is relatively weak compared to the models which contain enough information to facilitate a reasonable semantics of knowing?X, and this requires new techniques."}, {"heading": "1.2 Knowing how", "text": "Among all the knowing?X expressions, the most discussed one in philosophy and AI is \u201cknowing how\u201d. Indeed, it sounds the most distant from propositional knowledge (knowledge-that): knowing how to swim seems distinctly different from knowing that it is raining outside. One question that keeps philosophers busy is whether knowledgehow (the knowledge expressed by \u201cknowing how\u201d) is reducible to knowledge-that. Here philosophers split into two groups: the intellectualists who think knowledge-how is a subspecies of knowledge-that (e.g., [21]), and the anti-intellectuallists who do not think so (e.g., [22]). The anti-intellectualism may win your heart at the first glance by equating knowledge-how to certain ability, but the linguistically and logically well-versed intellectualists may have their comebacks at times (think about the previously mentioned interpretation of knowing?X as knowing an answer).6 In AI, starting from the early days\n4 Nevertheless Hintikka addressed some of those issues about first-order modal logic insightfully in the context of epistemic logic, see, e.g., a wonderful survey paper [8]. Many of those issues are also elegantly addressed in intensional first-order modal logic cf. e.g., [9]. 5 For example, knowing whether p \u2192 q and knowing whether p together does not entail knowing whether q. Likewise, knowing how to p and knowing how to q does not entail knowing how to p\u2227q. Moreover, you may not know why a tautology is a tautology which contradicts necessitation. 6 See [23] for a survey of the debate. A comprehensive collection of the related papers (200+) can be found at http://philpapers.org/browse/knowledge-how, edited by John Bengson.\n[24,25,26], people have been studying about representation and reasoning of procedural knowledgewhich is often treated as synonym for knowledge-how in AI, in particular about knowledge-how based on specifiable procedures such as coming out of a maze or winning a game. However, there is no common consensus on how to capture the logic of \u201cknowing how\u201d formally (cf. the excellent surveys [27,28]). In this paper we presents an attempt to formalize an important kind of \u201cknowing how\u201d and lay out its logic foundation, inspired by the aforementioned perspectives of linguistics, philosophy, and AI.\nSome clarifications have to be made before mentioning our ideas and their sources:\n\u2013 We will focus on the logic of goal-direct \u201cknowing how\u201d as Gochet puts it [27], such as knowing how to prove a theorem, how to open the door, how to bake a cake, and how to cure the disease, i.e., linguistically, mainly about knowing how followed by a achievement verb or an accomplishment verb according to the classification of Vendler [29].7 On the other hand, we will not talk about the following \u201cknowing how\u201d: I know how the computer works (explanation), I know how happy she is (degree of emotion), I know how to speak English (rule-direct) and so on. \u2013 The goal of this paper is not to address the philosophical debate between intellectualism and anti-intellectualism which we did discuss in [30,31]. However, to some extent, we are inspired by the ideas from both stands, and combine them in the formal work which may in turn shed new light on this philosophical issue. 8 \u2013 We focus on the single-agent case without probability, as the first step."}, {"heading": "1.3 Basic ideas behind the syntax and semantics", "text": "Different from the cases on \u201cknowing whether\u201d and \u201cknowing what\u201d, there is nothing close to a consensus on what would be the syntax and semantics of the logic of \u201cknowing how\u201d. Various attempts were made using Situation Calculus, ATL, or STIT logic to express different versions of \u201cknowing how\u201d, cf. e.g., [26,32,33,34,35,27]. However, as we mentioned before, we do not favour a compositional analysis using powerful logical languages. Instead, we would like to take the \u201cknowing how\u201d construction as a single (and only) modality in our language. It seems natural to introduce a modality Kh\u03d5 to express the goal-direct \u201cknowing how to achieve the goal \u03d5\u201d. It sounds similar to \u201chaving the ability to achieve the goal \u03d5\u201d, as many anti-intellectualists would agree. It seems harmless to go one step further as in the AI literature to interpret this type of \u201cknowing how\u201d as that the agent can achieve \u03d5. However, it is crucial to note the following problems of such an anti-intelectualistic ability account:\n1. Knowing how to achieve a goal may not entail that you can realize the goal now. For example, as intellectualists would remark, a broken-arm pianist may still know how to play piano even if he cannot play right now, and a chef may still know how to make cakes even when the sugar is run out (cf. e.g., [21]).\n7 Here knowing how to maintain something or to do an activity (like swimming) are not typical examples for our treatment, although we hope our formalism captures some common features shared also by them. As discussed in [27], \u201cknowing how\u201d plus activities, though more philosophically interesting, is less demanding in logic rendering than others. 8 Our logic is more about knowing how than knowledge-how though they are clearly related and often discussed interchangeably in the philosophy literature. The full nature of knowledge-how may not be revealed by the inference structure of the linguistic construction of knowing how.\n2. Even when you have the ability to win a lottery by luckily buying the right ticket (and indeed win it in the end), it does not mean you know how to win the lottery, since you cannot guarantee the result (cf. e.g., [36]).\nTo reconcile our intuition about the ability involved in \u201cknowing how\u201d and the first problem above, it is observed in [30] that \u201cknowing how\u201d expressions in context often come with implicit preconditions.9 For example, when you claim that you know how to go to the city center of Taipei from the airport, you are talking about what you can do under some implicit preconditions: e.g., the public transportation is still running or there is no strike of the taxi drivers. Likewise, it sounds all right to say that you know how to bake a cake even when you do not have all the ingredients right now: you can do it given you have all the ingredients. In our logical language, we make such context-dependent preconditions explicit by introducing the modality Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) expressing that the agent knows how to achieve \u03d5 given the precondition \u03c8.10 Actually, we used a similar conditional knowing what operator in [17] to capture the conditional knowledge such as \u201cI would know what my password for this website is, given it is 4-digit\u201d (since I only have one 4-digit password ever).11 In [17], this conditionaliztion proved to be also useful to encode the potential dynamics of knowledge. We will come back to this at the end of the paper.\nNow, to reconcile the intuition of ability with the second problem above, we need to interpret the ability more precisely to exclude the lucky draws. Our main idea comes from conformant planning in AI which is exactly about how to achieve a goal by a linear plan which can never fail given some initial uncertainty (cf. e.g., [39]). For example (taken from [40,41]), consider the following map of a floor, and suppose that you know you are at a place marked by p but do not know exactly where you are. Do you know how to reach a safe place (marked by q)?\nExample 1.\ns6 s7 : q s8 : q\ns1 r // s2 : p r //\nu\nOO\ns3 : p r //\nu\nOO\ns4 : q r //\nu\nOO\ns5 \u2774 \u2714 \u2774 \u2774 \u2774 \u2774 \u2774 \u2774 \u2774 \u2724 \u275a\n\u2724\u2724 \u2724\u2724\u2724 \u275a\u2774 \u2774 \u2774 \u2774 \u2774 \u2774 \u2774\u2774 \u2714\nIt is not hard to see that there exists a plan to guarantee your safety from any place marked by p, which is to move r first then move u. On the contrary, the plan rr and the plan umay fail sometimes depending on where you are actually. The locations in the map can be viewed as states of affairs and the labelled directional edges between the states can encode your own \u201cknowledge\u201d of the available actions and their effects.12 Intuitively, to know how to achieve \u03d5 requires that you can guarantee \u03d5. Consider the following examples which represent the agent\u2019s knowledge about his own abilities.\n9 Such conditions are rarely discussed in the philosophical literature of \u201cknowing how\u201d with few exceptions such as [37]. 10 By using the condition, one can be said to know better how to swim than another if he can do it in a more hostile environment (thus weakening the condition) [30] 11 Such conditionals are clearly not simple (material) implications and they are closely related to conditional probability and conditional belief (cf. e.g., [38]). 12 The agent may have more abilities de facto than what he may realize. It is important to make sure the agent can knowingly guarantee the goal in terms of the ability he is aware of, cf. [24,34,28].\nExample 2.\ns2 b // s4 : q\ns1 : p a\u2765\u2765\n55\u2765\u2765\u2765\na \u275a\u275a\n))\u275a\u275a\u275a s3\ns1 : p a // s3 b // s5 : q\ns2 : p b // s4 a // s6 : q\nThe graph on the left denotes that you know you can do a at the p-state s1 but you are not sure what the consequence is: it may lead to either s2 or s3, and the exact outcome is out of your control. Therefore, this action is non-deterministic to you. In this case, ab is not a good plan since it may fail to be executable. Thus it sounds unreasonable to claim that you know how to reach q given p. Now consider the graph on the right. Let ab and ba be two treatments for the same symptom p depending on the exact cause (s1 or s2). As a doctor, it is indeed true that you can cure the patient (to achieve q) if you are told the exact cause. However, responsible as you are, can you say you know how to cure the patient given only the symptom p? A wrong treatment may kill the patient. These planning examples suggest the following truth condition for the modal formula Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) w.r.t. a graph-like model representing the agent\u2019s knowledge about his or her abilities (available actions and their possibly non-deterministic effects):\nThere exists a sequence \u03c3 of actions such that from all the \u03c8-states in the graph, \u03c3 will always succeed in reaching \u03d5-states.\nNote that the nesting structure of quantifiers in the above truth condition is \u2203\u2200\u2200.13 The first \u2203 fixes a unique sequence, the first \u2200 checks all the possible states satisfying the condition \u03c8, and the second \u2200 make sure the goal is guaranteed.\nThere are several points to be highlighted: 1. \u2203 cannot be swapped with the first \u2200: see the discussion about the second graph in Example 2, which amounts to the distinction between de re and de dicto in the setting of \u201cknowing how\u201d (cf. also [26,35,33,28] and uniform strategies in imperfect information games); 2. There is no explicit \u201cknowing that\u201d in the above truth condition, which differs from the truth conditions advocated by intellectualism [43] and the linguistically motivated \u2203xK\u03d5(x) rendering.14 On the other hand, the graph model represents the agent\u2019s knowledge of his actions and their effects (cf. [44]). 3. The truth condition is based on a Kripke-like model without epistemic relations as in the treatment of (imperfect) procedure information in [44]. As it will become more clear later on, it is not necessary to go for neighbourhood or topological models to accommodate non-normal modal logics if the truth condition of the modality is non-standard (cf. also [45,19,16]); 4. Finally, our interpretation of \u201cknowing how\u201d does not fit the standard scheme \u201cknowledge as elimination of uncertainty\u201d, and it is not about possible worlds indistinguishable from the \u201creal world\u201d. The truth of Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) does not depend on the actual world: it is \u201cglobal\u201d in nature.\nIn the next section, we will flesh out the above ideas in precise definitions and proofs: first a simple formal language, then the semantics based on the idea of planning, and\n13 In [42], the author introduced a modality for can \u03d5 with the following \u2203\u2200 schema over neighbourhood models: there is a relevant cluster of possible worlds (as the outcomes of an action) where \u03d5 is true in all of them. 14 This also distinguishes this work from our earlier philosophical discussion [30] where intellectualism was defended by giving an \u2203xK\u03d5(x)-like truth condition informally.\nfinally a sound and complete proof system. We hope our formal theory can clarify the above informal ideas further. In the last section, we summarize our novel ideas beyond the standard schema of epistemic logic, and point out many future directions."}, {"heading": "2 The logic", "text": "Definition 1. Given a set of proposition letters P, the language LKh is defined as follows:\n\u03d5 ::= \u22a4 | p | \u00ac\u03d5 | (\u03d5 \u2227 \u03d5) | Kh(\u03d5, \u03d5)\nwhere p \u2208 P. As discussed in the previous section, Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) expresses that the agent knows how to achieve \u03d5 given \u03c8.We use the standard abbreviations\u22a5, \u03d5\u2228\u03c8 and \u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8, and define U\u03d5 as Kh(\u00ac\u03d5,\u22a5). The meaning of U will become more clear after the semantics is defined.\nDefinition 2. Given the set of proposition letters P and a countable non-empty set of action symbols \u03a3. An ability map is essentially a labelled transition system (S,R,V) where:\n\u2013 S is a non-empty set of states; \u2013 R : \u03a3 \u2192 2S\u00d7S is a collection of transitions labelled by actions in \u03a3; \u2013 V : S \u2192 2P is a valuation function.\nWe write s a \u2192 t if (s, t) \u2208 R(a). For a sequence \u03c3 = a1 . . . an \u2208 \u03a3 \u2217, we write s \u03c3 \u2192 t if there exist s2 . . . sn such that s a1\u2192 s2 a2\u2192 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 an\u22121 \u2192 sn\nan\u2192 t. Note that \u03c3 can be the empty sequence \u01eb (when n = 0), and we set s \u01eb \u2192 s for any s. Let \u03c3k be the initial segment of \u03c3 up to ak for k \u2264 |\u03c3|. In particular let \u03c30 = \u01eb. We say that \u03c3 = a1 . . . an is strongly executable at s if: for any 0 \u2264 k < n and any t, s \u03c3k\u2192 t implies that t has at least one ak+1-successor. It is not hard to see that if \u03c3 is strongly executable at s then it is executable at s, i.e., s \u03c3 \u2192 t for some t.\nNote that, according to our above definition, ab is not strongly executable from s1 in the left-hand-side model of Example 2, since s3 has no b-successor but it can be reached from s1 by a = (ab)1.\nDefinition 3 (Semantics of LKh).\nM, s \u22a4 always M, s p \u21d4 p \u2208 V (s)\nM, s \u00ac\u03d5 \u21d4 M, s 2 \u03d5 M, s \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8 \u21d4 M, s \u03d5 and M, s \u03c8\nM, s Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) \u21d4 there exists a \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 such that for all s\u2032 such that M, s\u2032 \u03c8 :\n\u03c3 is strongly executable at s\u2032 and for all t such that s\u2032 \u03c3 \u2192 t,M, t \u03d5\nNote that the modality Kh is not local in the sense that its truth does not depend on the designated state where it is evaluated. Thus it either holds on all the states or none of them. It is not hard to see that the schema of \u2203\u2200\u2200 appears in the truth condition for Kh where the last \u2200 actually consists of two parts: the strong executability (there is a \u2200 in its definition) and the guarantee of the goal. These two together make sure the plan will never fail to achieve \u03d5. It is a simple exercise to see that Kh(p, q) holds in the model of\nExample 1, but not in the models of Example 2. Moreover, the operator U defined by Kh is actually a universal modality:15\nM, s U\u03d5 \u21d4 for all t \u2208 S,M, t \u03d5\nTo see this, check the following:\nM, s Kh(\u00ac\u03c8,\u22a5) \u21d4 there exists a \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 such that for every M, s\u2032 \u00ac\u03c8 :\n\u03c3 is strongly executable at s\u2032 and if s\u2032 \u03c3\n\u2192 t then M, t \u22a5 \u21d4 there exists a \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 such that for every M, s\u2032 \u00ac\u03c8 :\n\u03c3 is strongly executable at s\u2032 and there is no t such that s\u2032 \u03c3 \u2192 t\n\u21d4 there exists a \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 such that for every M, s\u2032 \u00ac\u03c8 : \u22a5 holds \u21d4 there exists a \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 such that there is no s\u2032 such that M, s\u2032 2 \u03c8 \u21d4 for all t \u2208 S ,M, t \u03c8\nProposition 1. The following are valid:\n1 Up \u2227 U(p \u2192 q) \u2192 Uq 2 Kh(p, r) \u2227Kh(r, q) \u2192 Kh(p, q) 3 U(p \u2192 q) \u2192 Kh(p, q) 4 Up \u2192 p 5 Kh(p, q) \u2192 UKh(p, q) 6 \u00acKh(p, q) \u2192 U\u00acKh(p, q)\nPROOF Since U is simply a universal modality 1 and 4 are obvious. 3 is due to the fact that \u01eb is allowed as a trivial plan. 5 and 6 are due to the fact that Kh is global. The only non-trivial case is 2. Note that if there is a strongly executable sequence \u03c3 leading you from any p-state to some r-state, and there is a strongly executable sequence \u03b7 from rstates to q-states, then \u03c3\u03b7 is strongly executable from any p-state and it will make sure that you end up with q-states from any p-state.\nThe validity of (2) above actually captures the intuitive compositionality of \u201cknowing how\u201d, as desired. Note that Kh(p, q) \u2227 Kh(p, r) \u2192 Kh(p, q \u2227 r) is not valid, as desired.\nBased on the above axioms, we propose the following proof system SKH for LKh (where \u03d5[\u03c8/p] is obtained by uniformly substituting p in \u03d5 by \u03c8):\nSystem SKH Axioms Rules TAUT all axioms of propositional logic MP \u03d5, \u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8\n\u03c8\nDISTU Up \u2227 U(p \u2192 q) \u2192 Uq NECU \u03d5\nU\u03d5\nCOMPKh Kh(p, r) \u2227 Kh(r, q) \u2192 Kh(p, q) SUB \u03d5(p)\n\u03d5[\u03c8/p]\nEMP U(p \u2192 q) \u2192 Kh(p, q)\nTU Up \u2192 p\n4KU Kh(p, q) \u2192 UKh(p, q)\n5KU \u00acKh(p, q) \u2192 U\u00acKh(p, q)\n15 Note that U is a very powerful modality in its expressiveness when combined with the standard modality, cf. [46].\nProposition 1 plus some reflection on the usual inference rules should establish the soundness of SKH. For completeness, we first get a taste of the deductive power of SKH by proving the following formulas which play important roles in the later completeness proof. In the rest of the paper we use \u22a2 to denote \u22a2SKH .\nProposition 2. We can derive the following in SKH (names are given to be used later):\nTRI Kh(p, p) WSKh U(p \u2192 r) \u2227 U(o \u2192 q) \u2227 Kh(r, o) \u2192 Kh(p, q) 4U Up \u2192 UUp 5U \u00acUp \u2192 U\u00acUp\nCOND Kh(\u22a5, p) UCONJ U(\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8) \u2194 (U\u03d5 \u2227 U\u03c8). PREKh Kh(Kh(p, q) \u2227 p, q). POSTKh Kh(r,Kh(p, q) \u2227 p) \u2192 Kh(r, q)\nMoreover, the following rule NECKh is admissible: \u22a2 \u03d5 =\u21d2 \u22a2 Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5).\nPROOF TRI is proved by applying NECU to the tautology p \u2192 p, followed by EMP. WSKh says if you weaken the goal and strengthen the condition you still know how. It is proved by applying EMP to U(p \u2192 r) and U(o \u2192 q) followed by applying COMPKh twice. 4U and 5U are special cases of 4KU and 5KU respectively since U\u03c8 := Kh(\u00ac\u03c8,\u22a5). Since \u22a5 \u2192 p is a tautology, we can apply NECU and EMP to obtain COND. UCONJ is a standard exercise for a normal modality. Interestingly, PREKh says that you know how to guarantee q given both p and the fact that you know how to guarantee q given p. It can be proved by distinguishing two cases: Kh(p, q) and \u00acKh(p, q), and use COND and WSKh respectively under the help of NECU. POSTKh can be proved easily based on COMPKh and PREKh. It says that you know how to achieve q given r if you know how to achieve a state where you know how to continue to achieve q.16 Finally NECKh is the necessitation rule forKhwhich can be derived by starting with the tautology \u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5 (given \u22a2 \u03d5) followed by the applications of NECU and EMP.\nRemark 1. From the above proposition and the system SKH, we see that U is indeed an S5modality which can be considered as a version of \u201cknowing that\u201d: you know that \u03d5 iff it holds on all the relevant possible states under the current restriction of attention (not just the epistemic alternatives to the actual one). The difference is that here the knowledgethat expressed by U\u03d5 refers to the \u201cbackground knowledge\u201d that you take for granted for now, rather than contingent but epistemically true facts in the standard epistemic logic. Another interesting thing to notice is that WSKh actually captures an important connection between \u201cknowing that\u201d and \u201cknowing how\u201d, e.g., you know how to cure a disease if you know that it is of a certain type and you know how to cure this type of the disease in general. We will come back to the relation between \u201cknowing how\u201d and \u201cknowing that\u201d at the end of the paper.\nIt is crucial to establish the following replacement rule to ease the later proofs.\nProposition 3. The replacement of equivalents (\u22a2 \u03d5 \u2194 \u03c8 =\u21d2 \u22a2 \u03c7 \u2194 \u03c7[\u03c8/\u03d5])17 is an admissible rule in SKH.\n16 This is an analog of a requirement of the modality Can in [26]. 17 Here the substitution can apply to some (not necessarily all) of the occurrences.\nPROOF It becomes a standard exercise in modal logic if we can prove that the following two rules are admissible in SKH:\n\u22a2 \u03c8 \u2194 \u03d5 =\u21d2 \u22a2 Kh(\u03c8, \u03c7) \u2194 Kh(\u03d5, \u03c7), \u22a2 \u03c8 \u2194 \u03d5 =\u21d2 \u22a2 Kh(\u03c7, \u03c8) \u2194 Kh(\u03c7, \u03d5).\nActually we can derive (all the instances of) these two rules as follows (we only show the first one since the second one is similar.):\n1 \u03c8 \u2194 \u03d5 assumed 2 \u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8 1, TAUT 3 U(\u03d5 \u2192 \u03c8) NECU 4 Kh(\u03d5, \u03c8) MP(EMP, 3) 5 Kh(\u03c8, \u03c7) \u2192 Kh(\u03d5, \u03c8) 4, TAUT 6 Kh(\u03c8, \u03c7) \u2192 (Kh(\u03d5, \u03c8) \u2227 Kh(\u03c8, \u03c7)) 5, TAUT 7 Kh(\u03d5, \u03c8) \u2227 Kh(\u03c8, \u03c7) \u2192 Kh(\u03d5, \u03c7) COMPKh, SUB 8 Kh(\u03c8, \u03c7) \u2192 Kh(\u03d5, \u03c7) MP(6, 7) 9 Kh(\u03d5, \u03c7) \u2192 Kh(\u03c8, \u03c7) symmetric version of 2-8 10 Kh(\u03c8, \u03c7) \u2194 Kh(\u03d5, \u03c7) TAUT\nIn the rest of the paper we often use the above rule of replacement implicitly.\nHere are some notions before we prove the completeness. Given a set of LKh formulas \u2206, let \u2206|Kh be the collection of its Kh formulas:\n\u2206|Kh = {\u03c7 | \u03c7 = Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) \u2208 \u2206}.\nSimilarly, let \u2206|\u00acKh be the following collection:\n\u2206|\u00acKh = {\u03c7 | \u03c7 = \u00acKh(\u03c8, \u03d5) \u2208 \u2206}.\nNow for each maximal consistent set of LKh formulas we build a canonical model.\nDefinition 4. Given a maximal consistent set \u0393 w.r.t. SKH, let \u03a3\u0393 = {\u3008\u03c8, \u03d5\u3009 | Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) \u2208 \u0393}, the canonical model for \u0393 is Mc\u0393 = \u3008S c \u0393 ,R c,Vc\u3009 where:\n\u2013 Sc\u0393 = {\u2206 | \u2206 is a maximal consistent set w.r.t. SKH and \u0393 |Kh = \u2206|Kh}; \u2013 \u2206 \u3008\u03c8,\u03d5\u3009 \u2212\u2192 c \u0398 iff Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) \u2208 \u0393 ,\u03c8 \u2208 \u2206, and \u03d5 \u2208 \u0398; \u2013 p \u2208 V c(\u2206) iff p \u2208 \u2206.\nClearly \u0393 is a state in Mc\u0393 . We say that \u2206 \u2208 S c \u0393 is a \u03d5-state if \u03d5 \u2208 \u2206.\nThe following two propositions are immediate:\nProposition 4. For any\u2206,\u2206\u2032 in Sc\u0393 , anyKh(\u03c8, \u03d5) \u2208 LKh,Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) \u2208 \u2206 iffKh(\u03c8, \u03d5) \u2208 \u2206 \u2032 iff Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) \u2208 \u0393.\nProposition 5. If \u2206 \u3008\u03c8,\u03d5\u3009 \u2212\u2192 \u0398 for some \u2206,\u0398 \u2208 Sc\u0393 then \u2206 \u3008\u03c8,\u03d5\u3009 \u2192 \u0398\u2032 for any \u0398\u2032 such that \u03d5 \u2208 \u0398\u2032.\nNow we prove a crucial proposition to be used later.\nProposition 6. If \u03d5 \u2208 \u2206 for all \u2206 \u2208 Sc\u0393 then U\u03d5 \u2208 \u2206 for all \u2206 \u2208 S c \u0393 .\nPROOF Suppose \u03d5 \u2208 \u2206 for all \u2206 \u2208 Sc\u0393 , then by the definition of S c \u0393 , \u00ac\u03d5 is not consistent with \u0393 |Kh \u222a \u0393 |\u00acKh, for otherwise \u0393 |Kh \u222a \u0393 |\u00acKh \u222a {\u00ac\u03d5} can be extended into a maximal consistent set in Sc\u0393 due to a standard Lindenbaum-like argument. Thus there are Kh(\u03c81, \u03d51), . . . , Kh(\u03c8k, \u03d5k) \u2208 \u0393 |Kh and \u00acKh(\u03c8 \u2032 1, \u03d5 \u2032 1), . . . , \u00acKh(\u03c8 \u2032 l , \u03d5 \u2032 l) \u2208 \u0393 |\u00acKh such that\n\u22a2 \u2227\n1\u2264i\u2264k\nKh(\u03c8i, \u03d5i) \u2227 \u2227\n1\u2264j\u2264l\n\u00acKh(\u03c8\u2032j , \u03d5 \u2032 j) \u2192 \u03d5.\nBy NECU,\n\u22a2 U( \u2227\n1\u2264i\u2264k\nKh(\u03c8i, \u03d5i) \u2227 \u2227\n1\u2264j\u2264l\n\u00acKh(\u03c8\u2032j , \u03d5 \u2032 j) \u2192 \u03d5).\nBy DISTU we have:\n\u22a2 U( \u2227\n1\u2264i\u2264k\nKh(\u03c8i, \u03d5i) \u2227 \u2227\n1\u2264j\u2264l\n\u00acKh(\u03c8\u2032j , \u03d5 \u2032 j)) \u2192 U\u03d5.\nSince Kh(\u03c81, \u03d51), . . . , Kh(\u03c8k, \u03d5k) \u2208 \u0393 |Kh, we have UKh(\u03c81, \u03d51), . . . , UKh(\u03c8k, \u03d5k) \u2208 \u0393 due to 4U and the fact that \u0393 is a maximal consistent set. Similarly, we have U\u00acKh(\u03c8\u20321, \u03d5 \u2032 1), . . . , U\u00acKh(\u03c8\u2032j , \u03d5 \u2032 j) \u2208 \u0393 due to 5U. Now due to a slight generalization of UCONJ, we have:\nU( \u2227\n1\u2264i\u2264k\nKh(\u03c8i, \u03d5i) \u2227 \u2227\n1\u2264j\u2264l\n\u00acKh(\u03c8\u2032j , \u03d5 \u2032 j)) \u2208 \u0393.\nNow it is immediate that U\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393 . Due to Proposition 4, U\u03d5 \u2208 \u2206 for all \u2206 \u2208 Sc\u0393 . Now we are ready to establish another key proposition for the truth lemma.\nProposition 7. Suppose that there are \u03c8\u2032, \u03d5\u2032 \u2208 LKh such that for each \u03c8-state \u2206 \u2208 S c \u0393 we have \u2206 \u3008\u03c8\u2032,\u03d5\u2032\u3009 \u2212\u2192 \u0398 for some \u0398 \u2208 Sc\u0393 , then U(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8 \u2032) \u2208 \u2206 for all \u2206 \u2208 Sc\u0393 .\nPROOF Suppose that every \u03c8-state has an outgoing \u3008\u03c8\u2032, \u03d5\u2032\u3009-transition, then by the definition of Rc, \u03c8\u2032 is in all the \u03c8-states. For each \u2206, either \u03c8 6\u2208 \u2206 or \u03c8 \u2208 \u2206 thus \u03c8\u2032 \u2208 \u2206. Now by the fact that \u2206 is maximally consistent it is not hard to show \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8\u2032 \u2208 \u2206 in both cases. By Proposition 6, U(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8\u2032) \u2208 \u2206 for all \u2206 \u2208 Sc\u0393 . Now we are ready to prove the truth lemma.\nLemma 1 (Truth lemma). For any \u03d5 \u2208 \u0393 : Mc\u0393 , \u2206 \u03d5 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03d5 \u2208 \u2206\nPROOF Boolean cases are trivial and we only focus on the case of Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5):.\n=\u21d2 : If Mc\u0393 , \u2206 Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5), then according to the semantics, there exists a (possibly empty) sequence \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3\u0393\n\u2217 such that for every \u2206\u2032 \u03c8: \u03c3 is strongly executable at \u2206\u2032 and if \u2206\u2032\n\u03c3 \u2192 \u2206\u2032\u2032 then Mc\u0393 , \u2206 \u2032\u2032 \u03d5. Due to the construction of Rc, there are Kh(\u03c81, \u03d51), . . . ,\nKh(\u03c8k, \u03d5k) in \u0393 such that \u03c3 = \u3008\u03c81, \u03d51\u3009 . . . \u3008\u03c8k, \u03d5k\u3009 for some k \u2265 0. If there is no \u03c8-state, then by IH, \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 \u0398 for all \u0398 \u2208 Sc\u0393 . By Proposition 6, U\u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 \u2206, i.e., Kh(\u03c8,\u22a5) \u2208 \u2206. Since \u22a5 \u2192 \u03d5 and \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8 are tautologies, by NECU, U(\u22a5 \u2192 \u03d5) and U(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8) are also in \u2206. Then by SUB and WSKh Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) \u2208 \u2206. In the following we suppose that there exists some \u03c8-state and call this assumption (\u25e6). There are two cases to be considered:\n\u2013 Suppose that k = 0, i.e, \u03c3 = \u01eb: By the semantics, we have for any \u0398 \u2208 Sc\u0393 : \u0398 \u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5, i.e., \u0398 2 \u03c8 or \u0398 \u03d5. By IH, \u03c8 6\u2208 \u0398 or \u03d5 \u2208 \u0398. Since \u0398 is maximally consistent, \u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5 \u2208 \u0398 for all \u0398 \u2208 Sc\u0393 . By Proposition 6, U(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5) \u2208 \u0398 for all \u0398 \u2208 S c \u0393 . By SUB\nand EMP, we have Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) \u2208 \u0398 for all \u0398 \u2208 Sc\u0393 , in particular, Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) \u2208 \u2206. \u2013 Suppose k > 0, recall that \u03c3m is the initial segment of \u03c3 up to \u3008\u03c8m, \u03d5m\u3009. We first prove the following claim (\u22c6):\nFor any m \u2208 [1, k]: (1) Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5m) \u2208 \u0393 , and (2) each \u03d5m-state is reached via \u03c3m from some \u03c8-state.\n\u2022 m = 1 : Due to the semantics ofKh, each \u03c8-state has an outgoing \u3008\u03c81, \u03d51\u3009transition. By Proposition 5, each \u03c8-state is connected with all the \u03d51 states by \u3008\u03c81, \u03d51\u3009-transitions, which proves (2). By Proposition 7, U(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c81) \u2208 \u0393 . By the definition of R\nc it is clear that Kh(\u03c81, \u03d51) \u2208 \u0393 . Now by SUB and WSKh, Kh(\u03c8, \u03d51) \u2208 \u0393 . \u2022 Suppose that the claim holds form = n\u22121 then we prove that it holds for m = n as well. By IH for the above claim (\u22c6), we have (i)Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5n\u22121) \u2208 \u0393 and (ii) all the \u03d5n\u22121-states are reached from some \u03c8-state by \u03c3n\u22121. Since \u03c3 is a witness of the truth of Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5), \u03c3 is strongly executable on each \u03c8-state. Now due to (ii) and the strong executability of \u03c3, we have (iii): each \u03d5n\u22121-state has some \u3008\u03c8n, \u03d5n\u3009-successor. By Proposition 7 we have U(\u03d5n\u22121 \u2192 \u03c8n) \u2208 \u0393 . By the definition of R\nc, Kh(\u03c8n, \u03d5n) \u2208 \u0393 , thus by WSKh we have Kh(\u03d5n\u22121, \u03d5n) \u2208 \u0393 . Due to (i) and COMPKh, Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5n) \u2208 \u0393. Now for (2) of the claim: By (iii) and the definition of Proposition 5, each \u03d5n-state is reached from some \u03d5n\u22121-state via \u3008\u03c8n, \u03d5n\u3009. Thus based on (ii) again, we have each \u03d5n-state is reached from some \u03c8-state. Now Claim (\u22c6) is proved. Let m = k, we have (1k) Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5k) \u2208 \u0393 and (2k) each \u03d5k-state is reached via \u03c3k = \u03c3 from some \u03c8-state (under the assumption (\u25e6)). Now since \u03c3 witnesses the truth of Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5), Mc\u0393 , \u2206 \u2032 \u03d5 for every \u03d5kstate \u2206\u2032. By IH of the main structural induction over formulas, \u03d5 \u2208 \u2206\u2032 for every \u2206\u2032 such that \u03d5k \u2208 \u2206\n\u2032. Thus it is not hard to see that \u03d5k \u2192 \u03d5 is in every state of Sc\u0393 , for otherwise there is a state \u2206 \u2032 such that \u03d5k,\u00ac\u03d5 \u2208 \u2206 \u2032. By Proposition 6, U(\u03d5k \u2192 \u03d5) \u2208 \u0393 . Thus Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) \u2208 \u0393 due to (1k), COMPKh and SUB. Therefore Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) \u2208 \u2206 due to Proposition 4.\nThis completes the proof of Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) \u2208 \u2206 if Mc\u0393 , \u2206 Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5).\nNow for the other way around: \u21d0=: Suppose that Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) \u2208 \u2206, i.e., Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) is in all the states ofMc\u0393 by Proposition 4, we need to show that Mc\u0393 , \u2206 Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5). There are three cases to be considered. \u2013 There is no \u0398 such that \u03c8 \u2208 \u0398.

The highlights of our framework are summarized below with connections to our earlier ideas on non-standard epistemic logics: \u2013 The \u201cknowing how\u201d construction is treated as a whole similar to our works on \u201cknowing whether\u201d and \u201cknowing what\u201d [16,19]. We would like to keep the language neat.\n\u2013 Semantically, \u201cknowing how\u201d is treated as a special conditional: being able to guarantee a goal given a precondition, partly inspired by the conditionalization in [17]. \u2013 The ability involved is further interpreted as having a plan that never fails to achieve the goal under the precondition, inspired by the work on conformant planning [41] where we uses the epistemic PDL language to encode the planning problem. \u2013 The semantics is based on labelled transition systems representing the agent\u2019s knowledge of his own abilities, inspired by the framework experimented in [44]. \u2013 Compared to the standard semantic schema of knowledge-that: true in all indistinguishable alternatives, our work has a more existential flavour: knowing how as having at least one good plan. Our modal operator is not local to the indistinguishable alternatives but it is about all the possible states even when they are distinguishable from the current world. Thus a cook can still be said to know how to cook a certain dish even if he knows that the ingredients are not available right now. There are a lot more to explore. We conjecture the logic is decidable and leave the modeltheoretical issues to the full version of this paper. Moreover, it is a natural extension to introduce the standard knowing-that operator K into the language and correspondingly add a set E \u2286 S in the model to capture the agent\u2019s local epistemic alternatives. Then we can define the local version of \u201cknowing how\u201d Kh\u03d5 as K\u03c8 \u2227 Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) for some \u03c8. Other obvious next steps include probabilistic and multi-agent versions of Kh. It also makes good sense to consider group notions of \u201cknowing how\u201d which may bring it closer to the framework of ATEL where a group of agents may achieve a lot more together (cf. [28]). More generally, we may consider program-based \u201cknowing how\u201d where conditional plans and iterated plans are allowed, which can be used to maintain a goal. It is also interesting to add the dynamic operators to the picture, i.e., the public announcements [\u03d5]. In particular, it is interesting to see how new knowledge-how is obtained by learning new knowledge-that e.g., Kh(p, q) \u2192 [p](Up\u2227Kh(\u22a4, q))may be a desired valid formula.18\nThere are also interesting philosophical questions related to our formal theory. For example, a new kind of logical omniscience may occur: if there is indeed a good plan to achieve \u03d5 according to the agent\u2019s abilities then he knows how to achieve \u03d5. To the\n18 Note that LKh may not have the enough pre-encoding power for announcements in itself, similar to the case of PALC discussed in [47]. In particular, [\u03c7]Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) \u2194 Kh([\u03c7]\u03c8, [\u03c7]\u03d5) may not be valid due to the lack of control in the syntax for the intermediate stages of the execution of a plan.\ntaste of philosophers, maybe an empty plan is not acceptable to witness knowledge-how, e.g., people would not say I know how to digest (by doing nothing). We can define a stronger modality Kh+(\u03c8, \u03d5) as Kh(\u03c8, \u03d5) \u2227 \u00acU(\u03c8 \u2192 \u03d5) to rule out such cases.19 Note that although U is definable by Kh in our setting, it does not have the philosophical implication that knowledge-that is actually a subspecies of knowledge-how, as strong anti-intellectulism would argue. Nevertheless, our axioms do tell us something about the interactions between \u201cknowing how\u201d and \u201cknowing that\u201d, e.g., WSKh says some (global) knowledge-that may let us know better how to reach our goal."}], "references": [{"title": "An Essay in Modal Logic", "author": ["G.H.
