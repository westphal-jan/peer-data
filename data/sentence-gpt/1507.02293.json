In this context, users often forward to their followers information they are exposed to via their followees, triggering the emergence of information cascades that travel through the network [2], and constantly create new links to information sources, triggering changes in the network itself over time. Importantly, recent empirical studies with Twitter data have shown that both information diffusion and network evolution are coupled and network changes are often triggered by information diffusion [3, 4, 5].\nWhile there have been many recent works on modeling information diffusion [2, 6, 7, 8, 9] and network evolution [10, 11, 12], most of them treat these two stochastic processes independently and separately, ignoring the influence one may have on the other over time. Thus, to better understand information diffusion and network evolution, there is an urgent need for joint probabilistic models of the two processes, which are largely inexistent to date.\nIn this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model, COEVOLVE, for the joint dynamics of information diffusion and network evolution. Our model is based on the framework of temporal point processes, which explicitly characterize the continuous time interval between events, and it consists of two interwoven and interdependent components, as shown in Figure 1:\nI. Information diffusion process. We design an \u201cidentity revealing\u201d multivariate Hawkes process [13] to capture the mutual excitation behavior of retweeting events, where the intensity of such events in a user is boosted by previous events from her time-varying set of followees. Although Hawkes processes have been used for information diffusion before [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], the key innovation of our approach is to explicitly model the excitation due to a particular source node, hence revealing the identity of the source. Such\nar X\niv :1\n50 7.\n02 29\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.S I]\n8 J\nul 2\ndesign reflects the reality that information sources are explicitly acknowledged, and it also allows a particular information source to acquire new links in a rate according to her \u201cinformativeness\u201d.\nII. Network evolution process. We model link creation as an \u201cinformation driven\u201d survival process, and couple the intensity of this process with retweeting events. Although survival processes have been used for link creation before [22, 23], the key innovation in our model is to incorporate retweeting events as the driving force for such processes. Since our model has captured the source identity of each retweeting event, new links will be targeted toward the information sources, with an intensity proportional to their degree of excitation and each source\u2019s influence.\nOur model is designed in such a way that it allows the two processes, information diffusion and network evolution, unfold simultaneously in the same time scale and excise bidirectional influence on each other, allowing sophisticated coevolutionary dynamics to be generated (e.g., see Figures 1 and 6). Importantly, the flexibility of our model does not prevent us from efficiently simulating diffusion and link events from the model and learning its parameters from real world data:\n\u2022 Efficient simulation. We design a scalable sampling procedure that exploits the sparsity of the generated networks. Its complexity is O(nd logm), where n is the number of samples, m is the number of nodes and d is the maximum number of followees per user.\n\u2022 Convex parameters learning. We show that the model parameters that maximize the joint likelihood of observed diffusion and link creation events can be found via convex optimization.\nFinally, we experimentally verify that our model can produce coevolutionary dynamics of information diffusion and network evolution, and generate retweet and link events that obey common information diffusion patterns (e.g., cascade structure, size and depth), static network patterns (e.g., node degree) and temporal network patterns (e.g., shrinking diameter) described in related literature [24, 11, 25]. Furthermore, we show that, by modeling the coevolutionary dynamics, our model provide significantly more accurate link and diffusion event predictions than alternatives in large scale Twitter dataset [3]."}, {"heading": "1.1 Further Related Work", "text": "The works most closely related to ours are empirical studies of information diffusion and network evolution [26, 27, 5, 3, 4]. Among them, [5] was the first to show experimental evidence the likelihood that a user u starts following a user s increases with the number of messages from s seen by u. [3] investigated the temporal and statistical characteristics of retweet-driven connections within the Twitter network and then identified the number of retweets as a key factor to infer such connections. Authors in [4] showed that the Twitter network can be characterized by steady rates of change, interrupted by sudden bursts of new connections, triggered by retweet cascades. They also developed a method to predict which retweets are more likely to trigger these bursts. Finally, [28] utilized multivariate Hawkes process to establish a connection between temporal properties of activities and the structure of the network. In contrast to our work they studied the static properties, e.g., community structure and inferred the latent clusters using the observed activities.\nHowever, there are fundamental differences between the above mentioned studies and our work. First, they only characterize the effect that information diffusion has on the network dynamics, but not the bidirectional influence. In contrast, our probabilistic generative model takes into account the bidirectional influence between information diffusion and network dynamics. Second, previous studies are mostly empirical and only make binary predictions on link creation events. For example, [5, 3] predict whether a new link will be created based on the number of retweets; [4] predict whether a burst of new links will occur based on the number of retweets and users\u2019 similarity. In contrast, our model can learn parameters from real world data, and predict the precise timing of both diffusion and new link events."}, {"heading": "2 Backgrounds on Temporal Point Processes", "text": "A temporal point process is a random process whose realization consists of a list of discrete events localized in time, {ti} with ti \u2208 R+ and i \u2208 Z+. Many different types of data produced in online social networks can be represented as temporal point processes, such as the times of retweets and link creations. A temporal point process can be equivalently represented as a counting process, N(t), which records the number of events before time t. Let the historyH(t) be the list of times of events {t1, t2, . . . , tn} up to but not including time t. Then, the number of observed events in a small time window dt between [t, t + dt) is dN(t) = \u2211 ti\u2208H(t) \u03b4(t \u2212 ti) dt, and hence N(t) = \u222b t 0 dN(s), where \u03b4(t) is a Dirac delta function. More generally, given a function f(t), we can define the convolution with respect to dN(t) as\nf(t) ? dN(t) := \u222b t 0 f(t\u2212 \u03c4) dN(\u03c4) = \u2211 ti\u2208H(t) f(t\u2212 ti). (1)\nThe point process representation of temporal data is fundamentally different from the discrete time representation typically used in social network analysis. It directly models the time interval between events as random variables, and avoid the need to pick a time window to aggregate events. It allows temporal events to be modeled in a more fine grained fashion, and has a remarkably rich theoretical support [29].\nAn important way to characterize temporal point processes is via the conditional intensity function \u2014 a stochastic model for the time of the next event given all the times of previous events. Formally, the conditional intensity function \u03bb\u2217(t) (intensity, for short) is the conditional probability of observing an event in a small window [t, t + dt) given the historyH(t), i.e.,\n\u03bb\u2217(t)dt := P {event in [t, t+ dt)|H(t)} = E[dN(t)|H(t)], (2) where one typically assumes that only one event can happen in a small window of size dt, i.e., dN(t) \u2208 {0, 1}. Then, given a time t\u2032 > t, we can also characterize the conditional probability that no event happens during [t, t\u2032) and the conditional density that an event occurs at time t\u2032 as S\u2217(t\u2032) = exp(\u2212 \u222b t\u2032 t \u03bb\u2217(\u03c4) d\u03c4) and f\u2217(t\u2032) = \u03bb\u2217(t\u2032)S\u2217(t\u2032) respectively [29]. Furthermore, we can express the log-likelihood of a list of events {t1, t2, . . . , tn} in an observation window [0, T ) as\nL = n\u2211 i=1 log \u03bb\u2217(ti)\u2212 \u222b T 0 \u03bb\u2217(\u03c4) d\u03c4, T > tn. (3)\nThis simple log-likelihood will later enable us to learn the parameters of our model from observed data. Finally, the functional form of the intensity \u03bb\u2217(t) is often designed to capture the phenomena of interests. Some useful functional forms we will use later are [29]:\n(i) Poisson process. The intensity is assumed to be independent of the history H(t), but it can be a time-varying function, i.e., \u03bb\u2217(t) = g(t) > 0;\n(ii) Hawkes Process. The intensity models a mutual excitation between events, i.e., \u03bb\u2217(t) = \u00b5+ \u03b1\u03ba\u03c9(t) ? dN(t) = \u00b5+ \u03b1 \u2211\nti\u2208H(t) \u03ba\u03c9(t\u2212 ti), (4)\nwhere \u03ba\u03c9(t) := exp(\u2212\u03c9t)I[t > 0] is an exponential triggering kernel, \u00b5 > 0 is a baseline intensity independent of the history. Here, the occurrence of each historical event increases the intensity by a certain amount determined by the kernel and the weight \u03b1 > 0, making the intensity history dependent and a stochastic process by itself. We will focus on the exponential kernel in this paper. However, other functional forms for the triggering kernel, such as log-logistic function, are possible, and our model does not depend on this particular choice; and,\n(iii) Survival process. There is only one event for an instantiation of the process, i.e., \u03bb\u2217(t) = g\u2217(t)(1\u2212N(t)), (5)\nwhere \u03bb\u2217(t) becomes 0 if an event already happened before t."}, {"heading": "3 Generative Model of Information Diffusion and Network Co-evolution", "text": "In this section, we use the above background on temporal point processes to formulate our probabilistic generative model for the joint dynamics of information diffusion and network evolution."}, {"heading": "3.1 Event Representation", "text": "We model the generation of two types of events: tweet/retweet events, er, and link creation events, el. Instead of just the time t, we record each event as a triplet\ner or el := ( u \u2191\ndestination\n, source \u2193 s, t\n\u2191 time\n). (6)\nFor retweet event, the triplet means that the destination node u retweets at time t a tweet originally posted by source node s. Recording the source node s reflects the real world scenario that information sources are explicitly acknowledged. Note that the occurrence of event er does not mean that u is directly retweeting from or is connected to s. This event can happen when u is retweeting a message by another node u\u2032 where the original information source s is acknowledged. Node u will pass on the same source acknowledgement to its followers (e.g., \u201cI agree @a @b @c @s\u201d). Original tweets posted by node u are allowed in this notation. In this case, the event will simply be er = (u, u, t). Given a list of retweet events up to but not including time t, the history Hrus(t) of retweets by u due to source s is Hrus(t) = {eri = (ui, si, ti)|ui = u and si = s} . The entire history of retweet events is denoted as Hr(t) := \u222au,s\u2208[m]Hrus(t).\nFor link creation event, the triplet means that destination node u creates at time t a link to source node s, i.e., from time t on, node u starts following node s. To ease the exposition, we restrict ourselves to the case where links cannot be deleted and thus each (directed) link is created only once. However, our model can be easily augmented to consider multiple link creations and deletions per node pair, as discussed in Section 9. We denote the link creation history asHl(t)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Joint Model with Two Interwoven Components", "text": "Given m users, we use two sets of counting processes to record the generated events, one for information diffusion and the other for network evolution. More specifically,\nI. Retweet events are recorded using a matrixN(t) of size m\u00d7m for each fixed time point t. The (u, s)-th entry in the matrix, Nus(t) \u2208 {0} \u222a Z+, counts the number of retweets of u due to source s up to time t. These counting processes are \u201cidentity revealing\u201d, since they keep track of the source node that triggers each retweet. This matrix N(t) can be dense, since Nus(t) can be nonzero even when node u does not directly follow s. We also let dN(t) := ( dNus(t) )u,s\u2208[m].\nII. Link events are recorded using an adjacency matrix A(t) of size m \u00d7 m for each fixed time point t. The (u, s)-th entry in the matrix, Aus(t) \u2208 {0, 1}, indicates whether u is directly following s. That is Aus(t) = 1 means the directed link has been created before t. For simplicity of exposition, we do not allow self-links. The matrix A(t) is typically sparse, but the number of nonzero entries can change over time. We also define dA(t) := ( dAus(t) )u,s\u2208[m].\nThen the interwoven information diffusion and network evolution processes can be characterized using their respective intensities E[dN(t) |Hr(t) \u222a Hl(t)] = \u0393\u2217(t) dt and E[dA(t) |Hr(t) \u222a Hl(t)] = \u039b\u2217(t) dt, where \u0393\u2217(t) = ( \u03b3\u2217us(t) )u,s\u2208[m] and \u039b \u2217(t) = ( \u03bb\u2217us(t) )u,s\u2208[m]. The sign \u2217 means that the intensity matrices will depend on the joint history, Hr(t) \u222a Hl(t), and hence their evolution will be coupled. By this coupling, we make: (i) the counting processes for link creation to be \u201cinformation driven\u201d and (ii) the evolution of the linking structure to change the information diffusion process. Figure 1 illustrates our joint model. In the next two sections, we will specify the details of these two intensity matrices."}, {"heading": "3.3 Information Diffusion Process", "text": "We model the intensity, \u0393\u2217(t), for retweeting events using multivariate Hawkes process [13]:\n\u03b3\u2217us(t) = I[u = s] \u03b7u + I[u 6= s]\u03b2s \u2211\nv\u2208Fu(t) \u03ba\u03c91(t) ? (Auv(t) dNvs(t)) , (7)\nwhere I[\u00b7] is the indicator function and Fu(t) := {v \u2208 [m] : Auv(t) = 1} is the current set of followees of u. The term \u03b7u > 0 is the intensity of original tweets by a user u on his own initiative, becoming the source of a cascade and the term \u03b2s \u2211 v\u2208Fu(t) \u03ba\u03c9(t)? (Auv(t) dNvs(t)) models the propagation of peer influence over the network, where the triggering kernel \u03ba\u03c91(t) models the decay of peer influence over time. Note that the retweet intensity matrix \u0393\u2217(t) is by itself a stochastic process that depends on the time-varying network topology, the non-zero entries in A(t), whose growth is controlled by the network evolution process in Section 3.4. Hence the model design captures the influence of the network topology and each source\u2019s influence, \u03b2s, on the information diffusion process. More specifically, to compute \u03b3\u2217us(t), one first finds the current set Fu(t) of followees of u, and then aggregates the retweets of these followees that are due to source s. Note that these followees may or may not directly follow source s. Then, the more frequently node u is exposed to retweets of tweets originated from source s via her followees, the more likely she will also retweet a tweet originated from source s. Once node u retweets due to source s, the corresponding Nus(t) will be incremented, and this in turn will increase the likelihood of triggering retweets due to source s among the followers of u. Thus, the source does not simply broadcast the message to nodes directly following her but her influence propagates through the network even to those nodes that do not directly follow her. Finally, this information diffusion model allows a node to repeatedly generate events in a cascade, and is very different from the independent cascade or linear threshold models [30] which allow at most one event per node per cascade."}, {"heading": "3.4 Network Evolution Process", "text": "We model the intensity, \u039b\u2217(t), for link creation using a combination of survival and Hawkes process:\n\u03bb\u2217us(t) = (1\u2212Aus(t))(\u00b5u + \u03b1u \u03ba\u03c92(t) ? dNus(t)) (8) where the term 1 \u2212 Aus(t) effectively ensures a link is created only once, and after that, the corresponding intensity is set to zero. The term \u00b5u > 0 denotes a baseline intensity, which models when a node u decides to follow a source s spontaneously at her own initiative. The term \u03b1u\u03ba\u03c92(t) ? dNus(t) corresponds to the retweets of node u due to tweets originally published by source s, where the triggering kernel \u03ba\u03c92(t) models the decay of interests over time. Here, the higher the corresponding retweet intensity, the more likely u will find information by source s useful and will create a direct link to s.\nThe link creation intensity \u039b\u2217(t) is also a stochastic process by itself, which depends on the retweet events, and is driven by the retweet count increments dNus(t). It captures the influence of retweets on the link creation, and closes the loop of mutual influence between information diffusion and network topology.\nNote that creating a link is more than just adding a path or allowing information sources to take shortcuts during diffusion. The network evolution makes fundamental changes to the diffusion dynamics and stationary distribution of the diffusion process in Section 3.3. As shown in [15], given a fixed network structure A, the expected retweet intensity \u00b5s(t) at time t due to source s will depend of the network structure in a highly nonlinear fashion, i.e., \u00b5s(t) := E[\u0393\u2217\u00b7s(t)] = (e(A\u2212\u03c91I)t + \u03c91(A\u2212 \u03c91I)\u22121(e(A\u2212\u03c91I)t \u2212 I))\u03b7s, where \u03b7s \u2208 Rm has a single nonzero entry with value \u03b7s and e(A\u2212\u03c91I)t is the matrix exponential. When t\u2192\u221e, the stationary intensity \u00b5\u0304s = (I \u2212A/\u03c9)\u22121 \u03b7s is also nonlinearly related to the network structure. Thus given two network structures A(t) and A(t\u2032) at two points in time, which are different by a few edges, the effect of these edges on the information diffusion is not just simply an additive relation. Depending on how these newly created edges modify the eigen-structure of the sparse matrix A(t), their effect can be drastic to the information diffusion.\nAlgorithm 1 Efficient Simulation Initialization: Initialize the priority queue Q for \u2200 u, s \u2208 [m] do\nSample next link event elus from Aus (Algorithm 3) Q.insert(elus) Sample next retweet event erus from Nus (Algorithm 3) Q.insert(erus)\nGeneral Subroutine: t\u2190 0 while t < T do e\u2190 Q.extract min() if e = (u, s, t\u2032) is a retweet event then\nUpdate the historyHrus(t\u2032) = Hrus(t) \u222a {e} for \u2200 v s.t. u v do\nUpdate event intensity: \u03b3vs(t\u2032) = \u03b3vs(t\u2032\u2212) + \u03b2 Sample retweet event ervs from Nvs (Algorithm 3) Q.update key(ervs) if NOT s v then\nUpdate link intensity: \u03bbvs(t\u2032) = \u03bbvs(t\u2032\u2212) + \u03b1 Sample link event elvs from Avs (Algorithm 3) Q.update key(elvs)\nelse Update the historyHlus(t\u2032) = Hlus(t) \u222a {e} \u03bbus(t)\u2190 0 \u2200 t > t\u2032 t\u2190 t\u2032"}, {"heading": "4 Efficient Simulation of Coevolutionary Dynamics", "text": "We can simulate samples (link creations, tweets and retweets) from our model by adapting Ogata\u2019s thinning algorithm [31], originally designed for multidimensional Hawkes processes. However, a naive implementation of Ogata\u2019s algorithm would scale poorly, i.e., for each sample, we would need to re-evaluate \u0393\u2217(t) and \u039b\u2217(t), thus, to draw n samples, we would need to perform O(m2n2) operations, where m is the number of nodes.\nWe designed a sampling procedure that is especially well-fitted for the structure of our model. The algorithm is based on the following key idea: if we consider each intensity function in \u0393\u2217(t) and \u039b\u2217(t) as a separate Hawkes process and draw a sample from each, it is easy to show that the minimum among all these samples is a valid sample from the model [13]. However, by drawing samples from all intensities, the computational complexity would not improve. However, when the network is sparse, whenever we sample a new node (or link) event from the model, only a small number of intensity functions, in the local neighborhood of the node (or the link), will change. As a consequence, we can reuse most of the samples from the intensity functions for the next new sample and find which intensity functions we need to change in O(logm) operations, using a heap. Finally, we exploit the properties of the exponential function to update individual intensities for each new sample in O(1): let ti and ti+1 be two consecutive events, then, we can compute \u03bb\u2217(ti+1) as (\u03bb\u2217(ti) \u2212 \u00b5) exp(\u2212\u03c9(ti+1 \u2212 ti)) + \u00b5 without the need to compare all previous events.\nThe complete simulation algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1. By using Algorithm 1, we reduce the complexity from O(n2m2) to O(nd logm), where d is the maximum number of followees per node. That means, our algorithm scales logarithmically with the number of nodes and linearly with the number of edges at any point in time during the simulation. We also note that the events for link creations, tweets and retweets are generated in a temporally intertwined and interleaving fashion by Algorithm 1. This is because every new retweet event will modify the intensity for link creation, and after each link creation we also need to update the retweet intensities.\nAlgorithm 2 Efficient Intensity Computation Global Variabels: Last time of intensity computation: t Last value of intensity computation: I Initialization: t = 0, I = \u00b5 function get intensity(t\u2032) I \u2032 = (I \u2212 \u00b5) exp(\u2212\u03c9(t\u2032 \u2212 t)) + \u00b5 t = t\u2032, I = I \u2032\nreturn I end function\nAlgorithm 3 Sampling Input: Current time: t Output: Next event time: s Set s\u2190 t and \u03bb\u0302\u2190 \u03bb(s) (Algorithm 2) while s < T do\nGenerate g \u223c exp(\u03bb\u0302) set s\u2190 s+ g Set \u03bb\u0304\u2190 \u03bb(s) (Algorithm 2) Rejection test: Generate d \u223c U(0, 1) if d\u00d7 \u03bb\u0302 < \u03bb\u0304 then return s else \u03bb\u0302 = \u03bb\u0304\nreturn s"}, {"heading": "5 Efficient Parameter Estimation from Coevolutionary Events", "text": "Given a collection of retweet events E = {eri } and link creation events A = {eli} recorded within a time window [0, T ), we can easily estimate the parameters needed in our model using maximum likelihood estimation.

For such pairs with no observed events, the corresponding counting processes have essentially survived the observation window [0, T ), and the term \u2212 \u222b T 0 \u03b3\u2217us(\u03c4)d\u03c4 simply corresponds to the log survival probability. Terms corresponding to links have a similar structure to those for retweet.

Integration of \u03b3\u2217us(t) and \u03bb \u2217 us still results in linear functions of the parameters. Thus the overall objective in Eq. (9) is concave, and the global optimum can be found by many algorithms. In our experiments, we adapt the efficient algorithm developed in previous work [20, 21].

It\u2019s easily seen that shortly after being retweeted she has been found as a valuable source of information. Links established to her is illustrated by Magenta spikes which usually come after red ones. This clearly indicates how the information diffusion affects network structure. On the other side, let\u2019s see how the framework models the influence of network structure on information diffusion. Consider nodes 46 and 68 and compare their activities. Node 46 has been more active lately and performs many retweets. To see why, note that soon after time 137 node 46 follows node 130 which is a very central node (i.e. following a lot of people) from information point of view.

Using point processes to model intertwined events in information networks opens up many interesting future modeling work. Our current model is just a show-case of a rich set of possibilities offered by a point process framework, which have been rarely explored before in large scale social network modeling. For example, we can generalize our model to support link deletion by introducing an intensity matrix \u039e\u2217(t) modeling link deletions as survival processes, i.e., \u039e\u2217(t) = (g\u2217us(t)Aus(t))u,s\u2208[m], and then consider the counting process A(t) associated with the adjacency matrix to evolve as E[dA(t)|Hr(t) \u222a Hl(t)] = \u039b\u2217(t) dt\u2212\u039e\u2217(t) dt. We can consider the number of nodes m(t) varying over time, modeling its intensity function E[dm(t)|Hr(t) \u222a Hl(t)] = \u03c3\u2217b (t) \u2212 \u03c3\u2217d(t), where \u03c3\u2217b (t) denotes a birth intensity and \u03c3 \u2217 d(t) denotes a death intensity. Furthermore, a large and diverse range of point processes can also be used instead in the framework and augment the current model without changing the efficiency of the simulation and the convexity of the parameter estimation, e.g., condition the intensity on additional external features, such as node attributes or edge types, and incorporate features from previous state of the diffusion or network structure."}], "references": [{"title": "What is Twitter, a social network or a news media", "author": ["Haewoon Kwak", "Changhyun Lee", "Hosung Park", "Sue Moon"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on World Wide Web,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Can cascades be predicted", "author": ["Justin Cheng", "Lada Adamic", "P Alex Dow", "Jon Michael Kleinberg", "Jure Leskovec"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on World wide web,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Co-evolutionary dynamics in social networks: A case study of twitter", "author": ["Demetris Antoniades", "Constantine Dovrolis"], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1309.6001,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2013}, {"title": "The bursty dynamics of the twitter information network", "author": ["Seth A Myers", "Jure Leskovec"], "venue": "In 23rd International Conference on the World Wide Web,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2014}, {"title": "The role of information diffusion in the evolution of social networks", "author": ["Lilian Weng", "Jacob Ratkiewicz", "Nicola Perra", "Bruno Gon\u00e7alves", "Carlos Castillo", "Francesco Bonchi", "Rossano Schifanella", "Filippo Menczer", "Alessandro Flammini"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Scalable influence estimation in continuoustime diffusion networks", "author": ["Nan Du", "Le Song", "Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez", "Hongyuan Zha"], "venue": "In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems", "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Uncovering the temporal dynamics of diffusion networks", "author": ["Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez", "David Balduzzi", "Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning,", "citeRegEx": "7", "shortCiteRegEx": "7", "year": 2011}, {"title": "Inferring networks of diffusion and influence", "author": ["Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez", "Jure Leskovec", "Andreas Krause"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,", "citeRegEx": "8", "shortCiteRegEx": "8", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Back to the past: Source identification in diffusion networks from partially observed cascades", "author": ["Mehrdad Farajtabar", "Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez", "Nan Du", "Mohammad Zamani", "Hongyuan Zha", "Le Song"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS),", "citeRegEx": "9", "shortCiteRegEx": "9", "year": 2015}, {"title": "R-mat: A recursive model for graph mining", "author": ["Deepayan Chakrabarti", "Yiping Zhan", "Christos Faloutsos"], "venue": "Computer Science Department,", "citeRegEx": "10", "shortCiteRegEx": "10", "year": 2004}, {"title": "Kronecker graphs: An approach to modeling networks", "author": ["Jure Leskovec", "Deepayan Chakrabarti", "Jon Kleinberg", "Christos Faloutsos", "Zoubin Ghahramani"], "venue": "Journal of Machine Learning Research,", "citeRegEx": "11", "shortCiteRegEx": "11", "year": 2010}, {"title": "Microscopic evolution of social networks", "author": ["Jure Leskovec", "Lars Backstrom", "Ravi Kumar", "Andrew Tomkins"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining,", "citeRegEx": "12", "shortCiteRegEx": "12", "year": 2008}, {"title": "Multivariate Hawkes Processes", "author": ["Thomas Josef Liniger"], "venue": "PhD thesis, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich,", "citeRegEx": "13", "shortCiteRegEx": "13", "year": 2009}, {"title": "Modelling reciprocating relationships with hawkes processes", "author": ["Charles Blundell", "Jeff Beck", "Katherine A Heller"], "venue": "In nips,", "citeRegEx": "14", "shortCiteRegEx": "14", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Shaping social activity by incentivizing users", "author": ["Mehrdad Farajtabar", "Nan Du", "Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez", "Isabel Valera", "Hongyuan Zha", "Le Song"], "venue": "In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS),", "citeRegEx": "15", "shortCiteRegEx": "15", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Dirichlet-hawkes processes with applications to clustering continuous-time document streams", "author": ["Nan Du", "Mehrdad Farajtabar", "Amr Ahmed", "Alexander J Smola", "Le Song"], "venue": "In KDD.
