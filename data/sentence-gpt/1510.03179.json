Ontologies can overcome the drawbacks of partially available, noisy, inconsistent, and heterogeneous data sources [15]. Domain specific ontologies have already been developed for the renewable energy sector [14, 10, 13].\nIn this line, we aim to develop an ontology for wind energy domain. The ontology was developed in the RacerPro (Renamed ABox and Concept Expression Reasoner Professional) knowledge representation and reasoning system [9]. In our view, RacerPro and the corresponding Knowledge Representation System Specification (KRSS) syntax for Description Logic axioms are powerful technical instrumentation that support ontology engineering behind the basic capabilities provided by GUI-based ontology editors. Compared to the ontologies listed in Table 1, the particularity of our ontology is to complement knowledge extracted from various maps with local observations about the location. Aiming to deal with small wind projects, we rely on 30-50 meter height wind maps and we also include community-scale wind resource maps to quantify the wind resource.\nThe remaining of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 briefly introduces the KRSS syntax in which the ontology was developed. Section 3 illustrates how the available knowledge was reused. Section 4 shows the main engineering steps of the ontology. Section 5 depicts how the ontology can be interrogated, while section 6 concludes the paper."}, {"heading": "2 Technical instrumentation", "text": "The wind data is modelled in an ontology, which is a semantic framework for organising information. We formalise the wind ontology in Description Logic (DL). In the description logic ALC, concepts are built using the set of constructors formed by negation, conjunction, disjunction, value restriction, and existential restriction [2], as shown in Table 2. Here, C and D represent concept descriptions, while r is a role name. The semantics is defined based on an interpretation I = (\u2206I , \u00b7I ), where the domain \u2206I of\n1\nI contains a non-empty set of individuals, and the interpretation function \u00b7I maps each concept name C to a set of individuals CI \u2208 \u2206I and each role r to a binary relation rI \u2208 \u2206I \u00d7\u2206I . The last column of Table 2 shows the extension of \u00b7I for non-atomic concepts.\nAn ontology consists of terminologies (or TBoxes) and assertions (or ABoxes). A terminology TBox is a finite set of terminological axioms of the form (equiv C D) or (implies C D). An assertional box ABox is a finite set of concept assertions (instance i C), role assertions (related i j r), or attribute fillers (attribute-filler i value a), where C designates a concept, r a role, a an attribute, and i,j are two individuals. Usually, the unique name assumption holds within the same ABox . A concept C is satisfied if there exists an interpretation I such that CI 6= \u2205. The concept D subsumes the concept C , represented by (implies C D) if C I \u2286 D I for all interpretations I . Constraints on concepts (i.e. disjoint) or on roles (domain, range of a role, inverse roles, or transitive properties) can be specified in more expressive description logics. We provide only some basic terminologies of DL in this paper to make it self-contained. For a detailed explanation about families of description logics, the reader is referred to [2]."}, {"heading": "3 Reusing related ontologies", "text": "The process of engineering the ontology was started by: 1) specifying use cases of the ontology, 2) defining a set of competency questions, and 3) analysing the existing ontologies for possible reuse.\nFirst, the use cases of the ontology include i) \u201dthe assessment of the feasibility to install a particular small-scale wind turbine in a given location\u201d or ii) \u201cchecking whether a small wind project is compliant with current regulations.\nSecond, a solution to narrow the scope of an ontology is to start by defining a list of competency questions (CQs) [16]. CQs are questions that an ontology should be able to answer in order to satisfy use\ncases. Thereby, CQs represent initial requirements and they can be used to validate the ontology. Having the role of a requirement, each CQs are initially written in natural language (see Table 3). Then, CQs are formalised in the new Racer Query Language (nRQL) [9] for the task of ontology validation, .\nThird, several types of ontologies are needed to merge the input data which is collected in different format and several measurements types are exploited. Thus, existing knowledge bases like wind ontology or measurement ontologies can be exploited. For handling data directly coming from sensors, knowledge about the type of sensor or error and transmission rate are needed, which can be extracted from a specific sensor ontology. Merging different GIS maps requires geographical knowledge. The reused ontologies are listed in Table 4. First, from the GeoNames ontology we exploited: i) hypsographic features (concepts like Mountain, Hill, Valley, Slope, Mesa, Cliff), ii) road features (concept like Junction, or roles like roadWidth), iii) populated places (City, Area, ResidentialArea), or iv) vegetation features (Forrest, Orchard, Scrubland, Vineyard). Second, we used BayesOWL ontology [6] to represent random variables such as WindRose or WindShear. Third, we reused concepts from the sensor ontology to describe knowledge about wind-related sensors, as in the following definitions:\n(implies (or Anemometer WindProfiler WindVane) Sensor) (implies (or CupAnemometer PropellerAnemometer SonicAnemometer) Anemometer)"}, {"heading": "4 Engineering the wind potential assessment ontology", "text": "To develop the wind ontology, we follow the methodology in [16] and we also enact various ontology design patterns [18, 8]. The ontology is a modular one, consisting of a core formalisation and T-boxes for modeling various aspects in the wind energy domain: sub-components of a turbine, classes of turbines, potential of a location, etc.\nThe sub-componets of a wind turbine are represented by the transitive role hasPart:\n(define-primitive-role hasPart :transitive t)\nA turbine has one base, one tower, one nacelle, and several blades:\n(implies WindTurbine (and (=1 hasPart Base) (=1 hasPart Tower) (=1 hasPart Nacelle) (some hasPart Blade)))\nGiven the transitivity of the role hasPart, the system is able to deduce all the sub-components of a turbine. The nacelle houses a gearbox and generator, which can be either variable or fixed speed:\n(implies Nacelle (and (=1 hasPart Gearbox) (=1 hasPart Generator))) (implies Generator (or VariableGenerator FixedSpeedGeneartor)) (disjoint VariableGenerator FixedSpeedGeneartor)\nComponent prices and technical specification are attached to instances of the concept WindTurbine:\n(instance whisperH20 (and WindTurbine (= 595 hasPrice))) (instance towerKit1 (and Tower (= 450 hasPrice))) (related whisperH20 towerKit1 hasPart) (attribute-filler whisperH20 20 hasBladeArea)\nSmall wind turbines, defined as having a swept area less than 200 m2, are usually installed between 15 and 40 m high:\n(implies SmallWindTurbine (and WindTurbine (min sweptArea 200) (min high 15) (max high 40)))\nA good wind resource is one where wind speeds average 16 mph or more over the course of a year:\n(define-concrete-domain-attrbiute speedAverage :domain Location :type integer) (implies GoodWindResource (and WindResource (min speedAverage 16)))\nWind speeds are categorized by class, from a low of class 1 to a high of class 7. Wind speeds of class 4 or greater are used for wind power production:\n(implies GoodWindResource (or WindClass4 WindClass5 WindClass6 WindClass7)))\nThe power of the wind is measured in watts per square meter, and this increases by the cube of the wind speed:\n(implies top (= windpower (* windspeed windspeed windspeed)))\nGIS maps are the main source of data fed in the Aboxes of the ontology: (1) wind potential map, (2) wind power map, (3) topographical map, (4) open street map (OSM), (5) transmission lines, (6) archaeological map, (7) vegetation map, (8) rivers and lakes map, (9) digital elevation models. For instance, for converting OSM into KRSS syntax we developed a Java-based converter based on the Osmosis API to import facts about roads. From the wind power map, we defined the potential of a particular wind resource in three classes for the wind speed measured at 50m: marginal, promising, or excellent:\n(implies MarginalPotentialat50 (and (= hasMeasuredHeight 50) (< 7.5 windSpeed))) (implies PromisingPotentialat50 (and (= hasMeasuredHeight 50) (> 7.5 windSpeed) (< 10 windSpeed))) (implies ExcellentPotentialat50 (and (= hasMeasuredHeight 50) (> 10 windSpeed)))\nThe general concept MarginalPotential is the union of the marginal potentials at different heigths:\n(equivalent MarginalPotential (or MarginalPotentialat15 MarginalPotentialat50 MarginalPotentialat100))\nThese concepts can be used to make rough production estimates at sites, given that the accuracy is +/- 10 to 15% what the actual winds at a site may be.\nAccess roads of at least 4m wide are assumed necessary, given by:\n1. (define-concrete-domain-attribute width :domain Road :type real) 2. (implies TurbineAccessRoad (and Road (>= width 4.0)))\nWind turbines are efficient in coast, hills, and mountains regions:\n3. (implies WindTurbine (all efficientIn (or Coast Hill Mountain)))\nTheoretically, wind turbines can extract up to 59% from the energy which passes through it. Practically, an efficient turbine extracts around 40% from the wind potential [3]. The individual wt1 is an instance of the concept WindTurbine that is able to extract 38% from the wind energy:\n4. (define-concrete-domain-attribute extracts :domain WindTurbine :type real) 5. (instance teoreticalLimit (= extracts 0.59)) 6. (instance practicalLimit (< extracts 0.40)) 7. (instance wt1 (and WindTurbine (= practicalLimit 38)))\nThe transitive role isLocated connects instances of type Entity with instances of the concept Location (line 21). \u201dPartition ontology design pattern\u201d [18] is used to define various types of locations (lines 22-23). The attributes hasLatitude and hasLongitute are introduced to define a point in space (lines 25-26). Because GIS maps are usually achieved for small regions, we defined aboxes for each region (line 27). Axiom 29 connects the wind turbine wt1 with the point p1. Because the role isLocated is transitive the system is able to infer that wp1 is located in all concepts representing more general locations than p1 (i.e. Dobrogea, Romania, given that (related Dobrogea Romania isLocated).\n21.

(related wt1 p1 isLocated)\nWhen setting a home-sized wind turbine, the rule of thumb states that turbine\u2019s rotor should be at least 10 meters above anything within 150 meters of the tower:\n(define-rule (?wt ProperWindTurbine) (and (?wt WindTurbine) (?wt ?h1 hasHeight) (?x top) (?x ?h2 hasHeight) (?dist DistanceBetween2Objects) (?dist ?wt hasObject) (?dist ?x hasObject) (?dist ?distance hasDistance) (< distance 150) (> ?h1 (+ h2 10)))\nHere, the wind turbine ?wt is proper if its heigth ?h1 is greater then the height h2 of any object ?x in the ontology (?x top). We enacted the \u201dn-ary ontology design pattern\u201d [18] to store the distance between two objects:\n(equivalent DistanceBetween2Objects (and (=2 hasObject) (=1 hasDistance))) (define-concrete-domain-attribute hasDistance :domain DistanceBetween2Objects :type real)\nThe role hasWindShear is used to describe the differences in wind speed at two different heights (line 12) In general, turbulence decreases and wind speed increases as height increases. A WindRose (line 13) shows the direction that the wind blows and the frequency of that direction at a particular location.\n11.

(implies WindRose (and (=1 hasDirection Direction) (=1 hasFrequency Frequency))) 14. (instance wr (and (= NW hasDirection) (= hasFrequency 0.6)))\nTo represent the random variable WindRose given the variable Day (P (WindRose|Day)) we enact the ConditionalProbability concept from the BayesOWL ontology [6]:\n41.

The following axioms checks whether the wind turbine is located at a minimum distance of 300m from a residential area.\n31. (instance v1 Village) 32.

We enact AllegroGraph [1] to perform geospatial reasoning on various tasks, such as computing the distance between a point and a geographic area. Using also the Harversine formula, the minimum distance d1 between potential wind turbine location p1 and residential area a1\nof v1 (line 34) is asserted in the ontology (line 37). Here, area a1 is a triangular shape defined by three points (line 33) and d1 is an instance of the concept Distance between the starting point the turbine wp1 and the ending point the village v1 (line 36). Given that the minimum distance between a turbine an a residential area should be 300m (fact 38) the ontology is able to infer that the turbine v1 breaches the above normative condition.\nFour types of queries on the wind-turbines ontology are illustrated: i) checking the ontology consistency (line 71), ii) retrieving information about individual wt1 (line 72), iii) identifing the sub-concepts of the various concepts in the ontology (lines 73-74) and iv) retrieving all wind turbines located in Dobrogea region (line 75).\n71.
