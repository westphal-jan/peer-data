The rules have been proposed and investigated from the point of view of formal concept analysis (shortly, FCA [24]) with linguistic hedges [15]. One of the basic problems in FCA is to extract, given a formal context, a set of attribute implications which is non-redundant and conveys the information about exactly all attribute implications which hold in the given formal context\u2014such sets are called (nonredundant) bases of formal contexts. One of the most profound approaches of determining bases exploits the notion of a pseudo-intent which originated in [28] and has been later utilized, e.g., in [23]. The bases given by pseudo-intents are not only non-redundant but in addition minimal in terms of their cardinality. In our paper, we deal with a general notion of a system of pseudo-intents which appears in the generalization of FCA which includes graded attributes and uses linguistic hedges to reduce the size of concept lattices [8]. By a graded attribute we mean an attribute (property/feature) which may be satisfied (present) to degrees instead of just satisfied/not satisfied (present/not present) as in the ordinary setting. In the past, there have been many approaches to extensions of the traditional concept analysis which accommodate graded attributes [2, 34, 37, 38] and related phenomena. Most of the approaches are focused solely on the structure of concept lattices with little or no attention paid to if-then rules. The exceptions seem the be the early works by Polland [38] and the results made in the framework of FCA with linguistic hedges, see [16] for a survey. In [38], the author proposes generalized pseudo-intents which ensure that the constructed sets of formulas are complete in data, i.e., convey the information about exactly all if-then rules which hold in the data, but are redundant in general. Using a more general setting, [3, 7] show that there is a general notion of a system of pseudo-intents which ensures both the completeness and non-redundancy. Unfortunately, the definition in [3] is not constructive and so far the procedure to find such systems was reduced to finding particular maximal independent sets of vertices in large graphs [6, 10]. In addition, it has been shown that the existence and uniqueness of systems of pseudo-intents is not ensured in the general\nsetting. Indeed, it follows that the properties of the underlying structures of truth degrees, which together with linguistic hedges determine the semantics of graded attribute implications, substantially affect the properties of such systems. In case of infinite structures of truth degrees, it is known that general systems of pseudo-intents may not exist [16]. The existence in case of finite structures was listed as one of the open problems in [35]. Our paper brings a positive answer to this question and shows that, among other results, that general systems of pseudo-intents can be determined in a polynomial time from any complete set of graded attribute implications. The result is based on some of our recent observations made in [41] where we have put in correspondence bases given by systems of pseudo-intents and non-redundant sets of graded attribute implications with saturated consequents where the non-redundancy of each formula is witnessed by its antecedent.\nDetailed description of the problem and the results requires precise introduction of the utilized notions. Therefore, we postpone it to Section 3 after presenting the preliminaries in Section 2. In Section 3, we include the algorithm and comment on its immediate consequences. The soundness of the algorithm is proved in Section 4 which also contains additional remarks and examples. Finally, we present conclusions in Section 5."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In this section, we present the basic notions related to the structures of truth degrees which are used in our paper and recall basic notions of graded attribute implications. We limit ourselves just to the notions which are utilized in this paper. Interested readers can find more details in [16]. Readers familiar with [41] can skip this section and go directly to Section 3.\nA residuated lattice [2, 22] is an algebra L = \u3008L,\u2227,\u2228,\u2297,\u2192, 0, 1\u3009 where \u3008L,\u2227,\u2228, 0, 1\u3009 is a bounded lattice with 0 and 1 being the least and the greatest elements of L, respectively, \u3008L,\u2297, 1\u3009 is a commutative monoid (i.e., \u2297 is commutative, associative, and 1 is neutral with respect to \u2297), and \u2297 and \u2192 satisfy\nthe so-called adjointness property: for all a, b, c \u2208 L, we have that a\u2297 b \u2264 c iff a \u2264 b \u2192 c. Further in the paper, L always stands for a residuated lattice of the form L = \u3008L,\u2227,\u2228,\u2297,\u2192, 0, 1\u3009. L is a complete residuated lattice whenever \u3008L,\u2227,\u2228, 0, 1\u3009 is a complete lattice, (i.e., infima and suprema exist for arbitrary subsets of L). If L is finite, then L is trivially complete. Examples of (complete) residuated lattices include popular structures defined on the real unit interval using left-continuous triangular norms [20, 32] and their finite substructures. The structures are utilized in mathematical fuzzy logics [18, 26, 27, 29] and their applications [33] as structures of truth degrees with \u2297 and \u2192 used as truth functions of \u201cfuzzy conjunction\u201d and \u201cfuzzy implication\u201d, respectively.\nAs usual, a map A : Y \u2192 L is called an L-set A in Y (or an L-fuzzy set [25]); R : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 L is called a binary L-relation between X and Y , R(x, y) \u2208 L is interpreted as the degree to which x \u2208 X and y \u2208 Y are related by R. The collection of all L-sets in Y is denoted by LY . Operations with L-sets are defined componentwise using operations in L. For instance, the union A \u222a B of L-sets A \u2208 LY and B \u2208 LY is an L-set in Y such that (A \u222a B)(y) = A(y) \u2228 B(y); analogously for \u2229 and \u2227. If a \u2208 L and A \u2208 LY then a\u2297A, called the a-multiple of A, is an L-set in Y defined by (a\u2297A)(y) = a \u2297 A(y) for all y \u2208 Y . For A,B \u2208 LY , we define the degree S(A,B) to which A is a subset of B by\nS(A,B) = \u2227\ny\u2208Y\n( A(y) \u2192 B(y) )\n(1)\nprovided that the infimum of {A(y) \u2192 B(y); y \u2208 Y } \u2286 L exists\u2014this condition is satisfied, e.g., if L is complete or if Y is finite. Note that S given by (1) can be understood as a binary L-relation on L-sets, i.e., for a fixed Y , it is a map of the form S : LY \u00d7 LY \u2192 L. It is easily seen that S(A,B) = 1 iff A(y) \u2264 B(y) for all y \u2208 Y in which case we write A \u2286 B and say that A is a full subset of B.\nRemark 1. Let us note that the notion of a graded subsethood (1) defined using the residuated implication has been proposed by Goguen [25, 26] and plays an important role in the interpretation of the if-then rules we consider in this paper. This corresponds with the fact that the usual inclusion of sets is used to define\nthe interpretation of the classic attribute implications. Indeed, if Y is a nonempty set of attributes (symbolic names), any formula of the form A \u21d2 B where A,B \u2286 Y is called an attribute implication [24]. Moreover, it is considered true given M \u2286 Y , written M |= A \u21d2 B, whenever A \u2286 M implies B \u2286 M . If we depart from the classic setting to the graded setting and replace the classic sets by L-sets A,B,M \u2208 LY , there are several possible ways how to define the notion of \u201cA \u21d2 B being true in M\u201d which all collapse to the ordinary notion when L is the two-element Boolean algebra. As it is described in detail in [16], two borderline (and both interesting) cases can be based on the graded and the full inclusion of L-sets.\nThe framework we use in our paper enables us to reason with several different interpretations of inclusion of L-sets, and thus several different ways of understanding the interpretation of data dependencies, using a single formalism which is based on additional parameterization of the semantics of the rules. Namely, we use the approach based on linguistic hedges [16]. In a more detail, given a non-empty and finite set Y of attributes and a complete residuated lattice L, a graded attribute implication in Y is an expression A \u21d2 B where A,B \u2208 LY ; A is called the antecedent of A \u21d2 B, B is called the consequent of A \u21d2 B. Furthermore, let \u2217 be a map \u2217 : L \u2192 L. For A,B,M \u2208 LY , the degree ||A \u21d2 B||\u2217M to which A \u21d2 B is true in M (under L and \u2217) is defined by\n||A \u21d2 B||\u2217M = S(A,M) \u2217 \u2192 S(B,M). (2)\nIn particular, \u2217 used in our considerations is always an idempotent truthstressing linguistic hedge [16], i.e., it satisfies the following conditions:\n1\u2217 = 1, (3) a\u2217 \u2264 a, (4)\n(a \u2192 b)\u2217 \u2264 a\u2217 \u2192 b\u2217, (5)\na\u2217\u2217 = a\u2217 (6)\nfor all a, b \u2208 L. Now, two important cases of (2) result by setting \u2217 to the identity (i.e., \u2217 is a map such that a\u2217 = a for all a \u2208 L) and the so-called\nglobalization [39] in which case a\u2217 = 1 for a = 1 and a\u2217 = 0 for a < 1. We refrain from detailed description of the role of hedges because it is presented elsewhere, see [44, 45, 46, 47] for the initial development of hedges in fuzzy logic in the wide sense, [30, 21] for the treatment in the context of mathematical fuzzy logics, and [16] for the explanation of the role of hedges as parameters of the interpretation of if-then rules. Also note that the approach to parameterization of the interpretation of if-then rules by hedges can be seen as a particular case of a more general approach which utilizes systems of isotone Galois connections and is described in [42].\nIn this paper, we utilize the notion of the semantic entailment of graded attribute implications. Each set of graded attribute implications (in a fixed Y ) is called a theory and is denoted by \u03a3,\u0393,\u2206, . . . An L-set M \u2208 LY is called a model of \u03a3 whenever ||A \u21d2 B||\u2217M = 1 for all A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u03a3. The set of all models of \u03a3 is denoted by Mod\u2217(\u03a3). The degree ||A \u21d2 B||\u2217\u03a3 to which A \u21d2 B is semantically entailed by \u03a3 is defined by\n||A \u21d2 B||\u2217\u03a3 = \u2227 M\u2208Mod\u2217(\u03a3) ||A \u21d2 B|| \u2217 M . (7)\nWe put \u03a3 E \u0393 and say that \u0393 is stronger than \u03a3 whenever\n||A \u21d2 B||\u2217\u03a3 \u2264 ||A \u21d2 B|| \u2217 \u0393 (8)\nfor all A,B \u2208 LY . Furthermore, \u03a3 and \u0393 are equivalent, written \u03a3 \u2261 \u0393, whenever \u03a3 E \u0393 and \u0393 E \u03a3. It is a well-known fact that \u0393 \u2261 \u03a3 iff Mod\u2217(\u03a3) = Mod\u2217(\u0393), see [9, 16]. Theory \u03a3 is called redundant whenever there is \u0393 \u2282 \u03a3 such that \u03a3 \u2261 \u0393; otherwise \u03a3 is called non-redundant. Theory \u03a3 is called minimal [43] whenever for each \u0393 such that \u03a3 \u2261 \u0393, we have |\u03a3| \u2264 |\u0393|. One of the basic properties of non-redundant sets of graded attribute implications is the following: \u03a3 is non-redundant iff ||A \u21d2 B||\u2217\u03a3\\{A\u21d2B} < 1 for all A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u03a3, see [12]. Furthermore, if ||A \u21d2 B||\u2217\u03a3\\{A\u21d2B} = 1 for A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u03a3, we say that A \u21d2 B is redundant in \u03a3.\nRecall from [41] that if \u03a3 is non-redundant, we say that the non-redundancy of \u03a3 is witnessed (by the antecedents of the formulas in \u03a3) whenever for every\nA \u21d2 B \u2208 \u03a3, we have that A \u2208 Mod\u2217(\u03a3 \\ {A \u21d2 B}). This is one of the key notions used in the present paper since we seek a procedure to transform a given set of graded attribute implications into an equivalent one which is non-redundant and its non-redundancy is witnessed.\nFinally, we have to recall the notion of least models which is useful in the characterization of the semantic entailment. Recall that each Mod\u2217(\u03a3) is an L\u2217-closure system [5, 12]. As a consequence, we may introduce the least model [M ]\u2217\u03a3 of \u03a3 which contains M :\n[M ]\u2217\u03a3 = \u22c2 {N \u2208 Mod\u2217(\u03a3); M \u2286 N}. (9)\nAccording to [16, Theorem 3.11], ||A \u21d2 B||\u2217\u03a3 = S(B, [A] \u2217 \u03a3) for any \u03a3 and all A,B \u2208 LY . Furthermore, [\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7]\u2217\u03a3 is an L \u2217-closure operator [5], i.e., it satisfies the following conditions\nA \u2286 [A]\u2217\u03a3, (10)\nS(A,B)\u2217 \u2264 S([A]\u2217\u03a3, [B] \u2217 \u03a3), (11)\n[[A]\u2217\u03a3] \u2217 \u03a3 = [A] \u2217 \u03a3, (12)\nfor all A,B \u2208 LY . Note that (10) and (12) are the usual extensivity and idempotency; (11) is a stronger form of monotony and, in particular, (11) implies that [A]\u2217\u03a3 \u2286 [B] \u2217 \u03a3 provided that A \u2286 B. Using least models, we can introduce graded attribute implications whose consequents are largest with respect to a given theory as follows: we say that A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u03a3 has a saturated consequent (with respect to \u03a3) whenever B = [A]\u2217\u03a3. A theory where each formula has a saturated consequent is called a theory with saturated consequents. According to [41, Lemma 4], for each \u0393 and\n\u03a3 = {A \u21d2 [A]\u2217\u0393; A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u0393}, (13)\nwe have \u0393 \u2261 \u03a3. Therefore, for each theory there is an equivalent theory consisting of graded attribute implications with saturated consequents."}, {"heading": "3 Problem setting and results", "text": "In our previous paper [41], we have shown that considering the globalization as the hedge, each theory can be transformed into a theory which is equivalent, nonredundant, and its non-redundancy is witnessed by antecedents of the formulas in the theory. Namely, if \u2022 denotes globalization on L, for any theory \u2206, we can consider\n\u0393 \u2286 {A \u21d2 [A]\u2022\u2206; A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u2206}, (14)\nsuch that \u0393 is non-redundant and \u0393 \u2261 \u2206, see [41, Lemma 4]. Furthermore, [41, Theorem 9] yields that\n\u03a3 = { [A]\u2022\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u2022 \u0393 } \u21d2 [A] \u2022 \u0393; A \u21d2 [A] \u2022 \u0393 \u2208 \u0393 } . (15)\nis non-redundant, its non-redundancy is witnessed, and \u03a3 \u2261 \u0393 \u2261 \u2206, i.e., \u03a3 is the desired theory. Since \u2206 \u2261 \u03a3, \u03a3 can be interpreted as a theory which conveys the same information as \u2206. As a consequence of having \u2022 as the globalization, \u03a3 is minimal in terms of the number of formulas it contains and may be significantly smaller than \u2206. In addition, \u03a3 may be considered more informative than \u2206 because (i) its consequents are saturated, i.e., they are the largest possible Lsets of attributes, and (ii) its non-redundancy is witnessed\u2014the non-redundancy of each formula in \u03a3 is directly observed from its antecedent because it is a model of the remaining formulas in \u03a3. Therefore, computing \u03a3 from \u2206 is desirable from several points of view.\nRemark 2. Note for readers familiar with non-redundant bases generated from data: [41] shows that for all equivalent theories with saturated consequents, \u03a3 given by (15) is uniquely given (considering \u2022 as the globalization) and the set of its antecedents forms a system of pseudo-intents of any formal L-context whose intents are exactly the models of \u03a3. As a consequence, if one finds a set of graded attribute implications which is complete in a given formal L-context considering globalization as the linguistic hedge, then the system of pseudo-intents of the formal L-context can be computed from the complete set of graded attribute\nimplications in a polynomial time. Indeed, as we have outlined here and as it is presented in [41], the procedure involves computations of least models for each formula in the complete set which may be done in polynomial time and efficient algorithms for computation of closures exist [4]. This is in contrast with computing the systems of pseudo-intents directly from a formal L-context which is known to be hard even in the classic case [19].\nThe goal of this paper is to show that equivalent non-redundant theories with saturated consequents and witnessed non-redundancy can be computed for any theory considering an arbitrary idempotent truth-stressing hedge and finite L, thus extending the previous results in [41] which was presented only for globalization. In such a setting, the semantics of graded attribute implications is very specific and all truth degrees that appear in antecedents and consequents of formulas can be seen as hard thresholds. Indeed, from (2) and the fact that \u2022 is globalization, it follows that\n||A \u21d2 B||\u2022M =\n \n\n1, if S(A,M) < 1 (i.e., A * M), S(B,M), otherwise. (16)\nIn particular, ||A \u21d2 B||\u2022M = 1 means A \u2286 M implies B \u2286 M . In words, if each y \u2208 Y is present in M at least to the degree to which it is present in A, then each y \u2208 Y is present in M at least to the degree to which it is present in B. Therefore, the degrees A(y) and B(y) can be seen as \u201chard thresholds\u201d for the presence of y \u2208 Y . In contrast, when \u2217 is a hedge other that the globalization, the thresholds are not so strict and may be seen as \u201csoft thresholds\u201d. This is best seen in the case of \u2217 being identity where ||A \u21d2 B||\u2217M = 1 means that the degree to which B is included in M is at least as high as the degree to which A is included in M . In general, we have ||A \u21d2 B||\u2217M \u2264 ||A \u21d2 B|| \u2022 M but not vice versa. For some structures of truth degrees, it seems that non-redundant bases computed from data using general \u2217 tend to be smaller than bases computed using \u2022 as it follows from the preliminary experimental evaluation we include in Section 4. Thus, in addition to solving the problem of existence of general systems of pseudo-intents, this may be seen as a practical motivation because\nusers usually want to infer bases as small as possible.\nLet us also recall that in [41, Example 4], we have presented observations showing that the procedure of obtaining \u03a3 as in (15) is not directly applicable in case of general theories and general hedges because \u03a3 may not be equivalent to \u0393 and the initial theory \u2206. In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach which is conceptually close to that in [41] but always ensures that the results are equivalent to the initial theories and have all the desired properties. The approach is based on a procedure which sequentially modifies the initial theory and in finitely many steps produces the result. An elementary step of the transformation of theories is formalized by a binary relation \u2290\u2217 on the set of all theories and it is defined as follows: For theories \u2206 and \u0393, we put\n\u2206 \u2290\u2217 \u0393 (17)\nwhenever \u2206 6= \u0393 and there are two distinct formulas A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u2206 and C \u21d2 D \u2208 \u2206 such that\n\u0393 = ( \u2206 \\ {A \u21d2 B} ) \u222a {A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D) \u21d2 B}. (18)\nFurthermore, \u2206 is called irreducible (under \u2217) whenever there is no \u0393 such that \u2206 \u2290\u2217 \u0393. By definition, \u2290\u2217 is a relation on the set of all theories. The fact \u2206 \u2290\u2217 \u0393 can be read \u201c\u2206 reduces to \u0393 (in a single step)\u201d and it represents an elementary step in a procedure which converts given theory to a theory with the desired properties. For convenience, we introduce the reflexive and transitive closure of \u2290\u2217 in the usual way: We put \u2206 \u2290\u22170 \u2206 for any \u2206 and, for any natural n, we put \u2206 \u2290\u2217n \u0393 whenever there is some \u039e such that \u2206 \u2290 \u2217 n\u22121 \u039e and \u039e \u2290 \u2217 \u0393. Finally, \u2290\u2217\u221e is the union of all \u2290 \u2217 n for all non-negative n.\nTheorem 1. Let L be finite, \u2217 be any idempotent truth-stressing hedge, \u0393 be a non-redundant/minimal set of graded attribute implications in Y with saturated consequents. Then, for each irreducible \u03a3 such that \u0393 \u2290\u2217\u221e \u03a3, the following conditions are satisfied:\n(i) \u03a3 \u2261 \u0393,\n(ii) \u03a3 is non-redundant/minimal,\n(iii) the non-redundancy of \u03a3 is witnessed.\nBefore we elaborate the proof in Section 4, let us comment on some immediate consequences of Theorem 1. The theorem implies that we can always start with any \u0393 and convert it, in finitely many steps, into \u03a3 with properties (i)\u2013 (iii). This is a consequence of two facts: First, using (13), for any \u0393 there is an equivalent and non-redundant set \u0393\u2032 with saturated consequents which can be computed in finitely many steps just by a repeated computation of least models in order to saturate the consequents of formulas in \u0393 and to remove redundant formulas. Clearly, such a procedure is polynomial. Second, we can apply Theorem 1 with \u0393\u2032 to get the desired \u03a3\u2014it remains to prove that an irreducible \u03a3 such that \u0393\u2032 \u2290\u2217\u221e \u03a3 and (i)\u2013(iii) hold can be found in finitely many steps but this fact comes almost immediately. Indeed, observe that \u2206 \u2290\u2217 \u039e means that \u039e differs from \u2206 in a single formula, namely in its antecedent, which is larger (in sense of the inclusion \u2286 of L-sets). Since both L and Y are assumed to be finite, reduction of any theory always terminates by an irreducible element and the number of elementary steps is, again, polynomial in the size of the initial theory. Therefore, it remains to prove that the outcome of the reduction is indeed a theory with the desired properties\u2014this is shown in Section 4.\nAn important consequence of Theorem 1 is for the existence of general systems of pseudo-intents of object-attribute data with graded attributes. Let us recall from [41] that for non-empty finite sets X (set of objects) and Y (set of attributes), and a binary L-relation I : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 L, the triplet I = \u3008X,Y, I\u3009 is called a formal L-context [2]. The degree ||A \u21d2 B||\u2217 I to which A \u21d2 B (A,B \u2208 LY ) is true in I (under \u2217), see [3], is defined as\n||A \u21d2 B||\u2217 I =\n\u2227\nx\u2208X ||A \u21d2 B|| \u2217 Ix\n(19)\nwhere Ix \u2208 L Y such that Ix(y) = I(x, y) for all x \u2208 X and y \u2208 Y . Thus, if I is considered in the usual way as a table consisting of rows corresponding to objects and columns corresponding to attributes, Ix represents the L-set of\nattributes of object x \u2208 X , i.e., it represents a single row of the table. Thus, ||A \u21d2 B||\u2217 I is indeed a degree to which the following condition is true: \u201cFor each object x \u2208 X , if (it is very true that) the object has all the attributes from A, then it has all the attributes from B\u201d. If \u03a3 satisfies\n||A \u21d2 B||\u2217\u03a3 = ||A \u21d2 B|| \u2217 I\n(20)\nfor all A,B \u2208 LY , then \u03a3 is called complete in I. In addition, if \u03a3 is nonredundant then it is called a (non-redundant) base of I; if \u03a3 is minimal then it is called a minimal base of I. In the description of bases, we consider the well-known concept-forming operators with a linguistic hedge [15]. Namely, we use a couple of operators \u2191 : LX \u2192 LY and \u2193 : LY \u2192 LX defined by\nA\u2191(y) = \u2227\nx\u2208X\n( A(x)\u2217 \u2192 I(x, y) ) , (21)\nB\u2193(x) = \u2227\ny\u2208Y\n( B(y) \u2192 I(x, y) ) , (22)\nfor all A \u2208 LX , B \u2208 LY , x \u2208 X , and y \u2208 Y . Importantly, the composition \u2193\u2191 of \u2193 and \u2191 is an L\u2217-closure operator [5] and it follows that \u03a3 is complete in I iff Mod\u2217(\u03a3) is the set of all fixed points of \u2193\u2191, see [9, 16]. Therefore, using this fact, we immediately get the following consequence of Theorem 1:\nCorollary 2. Let I = \u3008X,Y, I\u3009 be a formal L-context and let \u0393 be a nonredundant/minimal base of I which consists of formulas with saturated consequents. If L is finite then any irreducible \u03a3 such that \u0393 \u2290\u2217\u221e \u03a3 is a nonredundant/minimal base of I whose non-redundancy is witnessed.\nTherefore, from the existence of non-redundant bases with witnessed nonredundancy, we can directly derive, using [41, Theorem 10], the existence of general systems of pseudo-intents. Let us recall [6, 10, 16] that denoting\nU = {P \u2208 LY ; P 6= P \u2193\u2191}, (23)\nwe call P \u2286 U a system of pseudo-intents (of I) whenever for each P \u2208 U , we have\nP \u2208 P iff ||Q \u21d2 Q\u2193\u2191||\u2217P = 1 for any Q \u2208 P such that Q 6= P. (24)\nIf P exists, then\n\u03a3 = {P \u21d2 P \u2193\u2191; P \u2208 P} (25)\nis a non-redundant base of I, see [7, Theorem 10], and its non-redundancy is witnessed [41] and, obviously, each formula in \u03a3 has a saturated consequent. So far, the existence of such systems of pseudo-intents was proved only for finite L with globalization, see [3, 7] but [41, Theorem 10] shows that \u03a3 is a nonredundant base of I consisting of graded attribute implications with saturated consequents such that its non-redundancy is witnessed iff\nP = {A \u2208 LY; A \u21d2 A\u2193\u2191 \u2208 \u03a3} (26)\nis a system of pseudo-intents of I. Therefore, we conclude:\nCorollary 3. Let L, X, and Y be finite. For arbitrary \u2217 satisfying (3)\u2013(6), any formal L-context I = \u3008X,Y, I\u3009 has at least one system of pseudo-intents which determines a minimal base.\nIn addition, it follows from our previous remarks that a system of pseudointents of I can be computed, in a polynomial time, from any complete set in I. Thus, the procedure is tractable. As we have said before, this is in contrast with approaches to finding systems of pseudo-intents directly from I which are known, even in the classic case, to be hard, see [19] for the results on complexity related to enumerating pseudo-intents.\nRemark 3. We have presented the solution of the problem of existence of general systems of pseudo-intents using formal L-contexts as structures in which we evaluate formulas. In a similar setting, we could do the same with other semantic structures which yield the same notion of semantic entailment. For instance, in relational similarity-based databases [11], we can think of bases of similaritybased functional dependencies which are true in data tables over domains with similarities or their ranked extensions [14]. In all such cases, the important point is that systems of models of such rules can be identified with systems of fixed points of L\u2217-closure operators and, therefore, the procedure introduced in\nour paper, can also be applied in these settings where the notion of a system of pseudo-intents is present, see, e.g., [11]."}, {"heading": "4 Proofs and notes", "text": "In this section, we present the proof of Theorem 1 and present further notes, including an illustrative example, and some experimental observations which illustrate that in the case of other hedges than the globalization, non-redundant bases given by systems of pseudo-intents may be smaller. In order to prove the main assertion of the paper, we investigate properties of \u2290\u2217. In all the subsequent lemmas, we assume that L is a finite residuated lattice and \u2217 satisfies (3)\u2013(6).\nLemma 4. If \u2206 \u2290\u2217 \u0393, then \u2206 \u2261 \u0393.\nProof. Suppose that \u2206 \u2290\u2217 \u0393, i.e., there are distinct A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u2206 and C \u21d2 D \u2208 \u2206 such that \u0393 is of the form (18). Thus, \u0393 results from \u2206 by removing A \u21d2 B and adding the formula A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D) \u21d2 B. Trivially, for its antecedent A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D), we have A \u2286 A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D), i.e., \u0393 E \u2206. Indeed, for any M \u2208 LY , using the antitony of \u2192 and S in their first arguments together with the isotony of \u2217, we get that\n||A \u21d2 B||\u2217M = S(A,M) \u2217 \u2192 S(B,M)\n\u2264 S(A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D),M)\u2217 \u2192 S(B,M) = ||A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D) \u21d2 B||\u2217M .\nTherefore, Mod\u2217(\u2206) \u2286 Mod\u2217(\u0393) and thus \u0393 E \u2206, i.e., \u2206 is stronger than \u0393. It remains to show that \u2206 E \u0393 holds as well. Take any M \u2208 Mod\u2217(\u0393). Obviously, M \u2208 Mod\u2217(\u2206\\{A \u21d2 B}). By the adjointness and (4), we get S(C,A)\u2217\u2297C \u2286 A. Therefore, using properties of residuated lattices and hedges together with the\nfact that ||C \u21d2 D||\u2217M = 1, we get\nS(A,M)\u2217 \u2264 S(S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297 C,M)\u2217 = (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2192 S(C,M))\u2217\n\u2264 S(C,A)\u2217\u2217 \u2192 S(C,M)\u2217 = S(C,A)\u2217 \u2192 S(C,M)\u2217 \u2264 S(C,A)\u2217 \u2192 S(D,M) = S(S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D,M).\nTherefore, we may write\nS(A,M)\u2217 = S(A,M) \u2227 S(A,M)\u2217 \u2264 S(A,M) \u2227 S(S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D,M)\n= S(A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D),M)\nFrom the last inequality, applying ||A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D) \u21d2 B||\u2217M = 1, we get\nS(A,M)\u2217 \u2264 S(A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D),M)\u2217 \u2264 S(B,M),\nwhich proves that ||A \u21d2 B||\u2217M = 1, i.e., M \u2208 Mod \u2217(\u2206). Altogether, \u2206 \u2261 \u0393.\nRemark 4. Readers familiar with Armstrong-style axiomatic systems [1] of the logic of graded attribute implications parameterized by linguistic hedges, see [4, 13, 17, 40], may easily see that Lemma 4 can be proved by arguments about provability and utilizing the completeness theorems. Indeed, \u0393 E \u2206 is a consequence of the fact that the rule of weakening (also known as augmentation [4, 36]: from A \u21d2 B we infer A \u222a E \u21d2 B for E = S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297 D) is a derivable deduction rule in the logic. In addition, \u2206 E \u0393 follows by the rules of multiplication (from C \u21d2 D we infer a\u2217\u2297C \u21d2 a\u2217\u2297D for a = S(C,A)) and cut (also known as pseudo-transitivity [31, 36]: from S(C,A)\u2217\u2297C \u21d2 S(C,A)\u2217\u2297D and A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297 D) \u21d2 B we infer A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217\u2297C) \u21d2 B which equals to A \u21d2 B).\nLemma 5. If \u2206 has saturated consequents and \u2206 \u2290\u2217 \u0393, then so has \u0393.\nProof. Assume that A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u2206 and C \u21d2 D \u2208 \u2206 are the formulas from (18). Since \u2206 consists of formulas with saturated consequents, then A \u21d2 B and C \u21d2 D are in fact in the form A \u21d2 [A]\u2217\u2206 and C \u21d2 [C] \u2217 \u2206, respectively. Furthermore, using Lemma 4, \u2206 \u2261 \u0393, i.e., [E]\u2217\u2206 = [E] \u2217 \u0393 for any E \u2208 L Y . Thus, each formula\nin \u0393 \\ {A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297 [C]\u2217\u0393) \u21d2 [A] \u2217 \u0393} has a saturated consequent. Therefore, it remains to check this fact for the formula A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297 [C]\u2217\u0393) \u21d2 [A] \u2217 \u0393. By (10), we get A \u2286 [A]\u2217\u0393. Applying (11), we get S(C,A) \u2217 \u2264 S([C]\u2217\u0393, [A] \u2217 \u0393) and so the adjointness property gives S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297 [C]\u2217\u0393 \u2286 [A] \u2217 \u0393. Therefore, using (11) and (12), the previous inclusions yield\n[ A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297 [C]\u2217\u0393) ]\u2217 \u0393 \u2286 [A]\u2217\u0393. (27)\nThe converse inclusion to that in (27) follows directly from (11). As a consequence, A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297 [C]\u2217\u0393) \u21d2 [A] \u2217 \u0393 has a saturated consequent.\nLemma 6. If \u2206 is non-redundant and \u2206 \u2290\u2217 \u0393, then so is \u0393.\nProof. Again, we assume that \u0393 is a theory of the form (18) and \u2206 is nonredundant. First, note that A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297 D) \u21d2 B 6\u2208 \u2206 because otherwise A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297 D) \u21d2 B would be redundant in \u2206 because A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u2206\u2014a contradiction. Now, take arbitrary E \u21d2 F \u2208 \u0393\\{A\u222a(S(C,A)\u2217\u2297D) \u21d2 B}. The fact that E \u21d2 F is non-redundant in \u2206 means that ||E \u21d2 F ||\u2217\u2206\\{E\u21d2F} < 1. By similar arguments as in the proof of Lemma 4, it follows that \u0393 \\ {E \u21d2 F} E \u2206 \\ {E \u21d2 F}. Therefore, we have\n||E \u21d2 F ||\u2217\u0393\\{E\u21d2F} \u2264 ||E \u21d2 F || \u2217 \u2206\\{E\u21d2F} < 1\nwhich proves that E \u21d2 F is non-redundant in \u0393. Thus, it remains to prove that A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D) \u21d2 B is non-redundant in \u0393. By contradiction, let\n||A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D) \u21d2 B||\u2217\u0393\\{A\u222a(S(C,A)\u2217\u2297D)\u21d2B} = 1\nSince \u0393 and \u2206 differ only in the formula A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u2206 (and A\u222a(S(C,A)\u2217\u2297D) \u21d2 B \u2208 \u0393), we immediately get\n||A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D) \u21d2 B||\u2217\u2206\\{A\u21d2B} = 1.\nTherefore, for any M \u2208 Mod\u2217(\u2206 \\ {A \u21d2 B}), the previous fact yields M \u2208 Mod\u2217(\u0393). Since \u0393 \u2261 \u2206, we get that M \u2208 Mod\u2217(\u2206), i.e., Mod\u2217(\u2206\\{A \u21d2 B}) \u2286 Mod\u2217(\u2206) which contradicts the fact that \u2206 is non-redundant.\nLemma 7. Let \u03a3 be a non-redundant irreducible theory. Then the non-redundancy of \u03a3 is witnessed.\nProof. Take any A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u03a3. It suffices to show that A \u2208 Mod\u2217(\u03a3 \\ {A \u21d2 B}). Take any C \u21d2 D \u2208 \u03a3\\{A \u21d2 B}, i.e., A \u21d2 B and C \u21d2 D are distinct formulas. Now, observe that A \u222a (S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297 D) \u21d2 B 6\u2208 \u03a3 because otherwise the nonredundancy of \u03a3 would be violated owing to A \u21d2 B \u2208 \u03a3. Since \u03a3 is irreducible, we must have S(C,A)\u2217\u2297D \u2286 A which by adjointness yields S(C,A)\u2217 \u2264 S(D,A), i.e., A \u2208 Mod\u2217({C \u21d2 D}). As a consequence, A \u2208 Mod\u2217(\u03a3 \\ {A \u21d2 B}), which finishes the proof.\nProof of Theorem 1. The proof results by putting together the observations in the previous lemmas. Because of the finiteness of L and Y , the existence of irreducible \u03a3 such that \u0393 \u2290\u2217\u221e \u03a3 is ensured. Then, by induction, Lemma 4 yields \u03a3 \u2261 \u0393, Lemma 6 yields that \u03a3 is non-redundant, Lemma 5 yields that \u03a3 has saturated consequents. Finally, Lemma 7 shows that the non-redundancy of \u03a3 is witnessed. This proves Theorem 1 for \u0393 being non-redundant. If \u0393 is in addition minimal, it is easily seen that \u03a3 is minimal as well\u2014this follows directly by the form of (18).\nWe conclude this section by illustrative examples and some experimental observations on sizes of non-redundant bases determined from data using different hedges. In the examples we use the usual notation for writing L-sets on finite universe sets, namely, {a1/y1, . . . , an/yn} denotes an L-set A in Y = {y1, . . . , yn} such that A(yi) = ai for all i = 1, . . . , n. Optionally, we omit ai/yi whenever ai = 0 and write just yi instead of ai/yi whenever ai = 1.\nExample 1. Suppose that L is a residuated lattice with L = {0, 0.5, 1} and \u2297 = \u2227 (i.e., L is a the three-element Go\u0308del chain [2, 27, 32]) and let \u2217 be the identity. Furthermore, we take theory \u0393 from [41, Example 4]:\n\u0393 = {{0.5/p} \u21d2 {0.5/p, 0.5/q, r}, {p} \u21d2 {p, q, r}}.\nFor this theory on Y = {p, q, r} and the considered L and \u2217, [41, Example 4] shows that \u03a3 given by\n\u03a3 = { [A]\u2217\u0393\\{A\u21d2[A]\u2217 \u0393 } \u21d2 [A] \u2217 \u0393; A \u21d2 [A] \u2217 \u0393 \u2208 \u0393 } .\nwhich equals to\n\u03a3 = {{0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.5/r} \u21d2 {0.5/p, 0.5/q, r}, {p, 0.5/q, r} \u21d2 {p, q, r}}\nis not equivalent to \u0393. This is a particular example of a theory which cannot be converted into an equivalent one with witnessed non-redundancy using the method described in [41]. Using the method shown in the present paper, for \u0393 we may find an irreducible theory \u03a3\u2032 such that \u0393 \u2290\u2217\u221e \u03a3 \u2032. Actually, this can be done in a single step: For {0.5/p} \u21d2 {0.5/p, 0.5/q, r} \u2208 \u0393 and {p} \u21d2 {p, q, r} \u2208 \u0393, we can easily see that\nS({p}, {0.5/p})\u2217 \u2297 {p, q, r} = 0.5\u2297 {p, q, r} = {0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.5/r},\ni.e., \u0393 can be reduced to\n\u0393\u2032 = {{0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.5/r} \u21d2 {0.5/p, 0.5/q, r}, {p} \u21d2 {p, q, r}}\nand \u0393\u2032 is already irreducible. Thus, Theorem 1 yields that \u0393\u2032 is equivalent to \u0393, it is non-redundant, has saturated consequents, and its non-redundancy is witnessed. This example demonstrates that the outcome of the algorithm studied in the previous paper [41] is unnecessary weak in case of hedges other than the globalization.\nExample 2. In this example, we show a transformation of a non-redundant theory with saturated consequents into an equivalent theory with witnessed non-redundancy which takes more elementary steps. We assume that L is an equidistant five-element Lukasiewicz chain, i.e., L = {0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1} and the adjoint operations \u2297 and \u2192 are defined as a \u2297 b = max(0, a + b \u2212 1) and\na \u2192 b = min(1, 1\u2212 a+ b), respectively. Let\n\u03930 = {{ 0.25/r, 0.25/s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, 0.75/r, 0.25/s},\n{0.5/p, 0.25/q, 0.5/s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, r, 0.5/s}, {0.25/p, s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, q, r, s}}.\nIt can be easily checked that \u03930 is non-redundant and has saturated consequents. Also, it is evident that the non-redundancy of \u03930 is not witnessed because it is not irreducible. Indeed, there is \u03931 such that \u03930 \u2290 \u2217 \u03931. Namely, we can take the formulas A \u21d2 B and C \u21d2 D which appear in (18) as follows:\nA \u21d2 B is {0.25/r, 0.25/s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, 0.75/r, 0.25/s}, C \u21d2 D is {0.5/p, 0.25/q, 0.5/s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, r, 0.5/s}, S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D = 0.5\u2297 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, r, 0.5/s} = {0.25/p, 0.25/q, 0.5/r}, replace A \u21d2 B in \u03930 by { 0.25/p, 0.25/q, 0.5/r, 0.25/s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, 0.75/r, 0.25/s}.\nThus, \u03931 = (\u03930 \\ {A \u21d2 B}) \u222a {{ 0.25/p, 0.25/q, 0.5/r, 0.25/s} \u21d2 B}. For the new formula, we can repeat the procedure with the same C \u21d2 D. That is,\nA \u21d2 B is {0.25/p, 0.25/q, 0.5/r, 0.25/s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, 0.75/r, 0.25/s},\nC \u21d2 D is {0.5/p, 0.25/q, 0.5/s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, r, 0.5/s}, S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D = 0.75\u2297 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, r, 0.5/s} = {0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.75/r, 0.25/s}, replace A \u21d2 B in \u03931 by { 0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.75/r, 0.25/s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, 0.75/r, 0.25/s},\ni.e., \u03932 = (\u03931 \\ {A \u21d2 B}) \u222a {{ 0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.75/r, 0.25/s} \u21d2 B. In the next step, we update the antecedent of the formula which so far played the role of C \u21d2 D:\nA \u21d2 B is {0.5/p, 0.25/q, 0.5/s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, r, 0.5/s}, C \u21d2 D is {0.25/p, s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, q, r, s}, S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D = 0.5\u2297 {0.75/p, q, r, s} = {0.25/p, 0.5/q, 0.5/r, 0.5/s}, replace A \u21d2 B in \u03932 by { 0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.5/r, 0.5/s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, r, 0.5/s}.\nThus, \u03933 = (\u03932 \\ {A \u21d2 B}) \u222a {{ 0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.5/r, 0.5/s} \u21d2 B}. In the next step, we flip the roles of A \u21d2 B and C \u21d2 D from the previous step and make an\nupdate of the antecedent of {0.25/p, s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, q, r, s}:\nA \u21d2 B is {0.25/p, s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, q, r, s}, C \u21d2 D is {0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.5/r, 0.5/s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, r, 0.5/s}, S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D = 0.5\u2297 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, r, 0.5/s} = {0.25/p, 0.25/q, 0.5/r}, replace A \u21d2 B in \u03933 by { 0.25/p, 0.25/q, 0.5/r, s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, q, r, s},\ni.e., \u03934 = (\u03933 \\ {A \u21d2 B})\u222a{{ 0.25/p, 0.25/q, 0.5/r, s} \u21d2 B}. In the last two steps, we use the same formulas for update, i.e.,\nA \u21d2 B is {0.25/p, 0.25/q, 0.5/r, s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, q, r, s}, C \u21d2 D is {0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.5/r, 0.5/s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, r, 0.5/s}, S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D = 0.75\u2297 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, r, 0.5/s} = {0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.75/r, 0.25/s}, replace A \u21d2 B in \u03934 by { 0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.75/r, s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, q, r, s}.\nThus, \u03935 = (\u03934 \\ {A \u21d2 B}) \u222a {{ 0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.75/r, s} \u21d2 B}. Finally, we can see that C is now fully included in A, i.e.,\nA \u21d2 B is {0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.75/r, s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, q, r, s},\nC \u21d2 D is {0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.5/r, 0.5/s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, r, 0.5/s}, S(C,A)\u2217 \u2297D = 1.0\u2297 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, r, 0.5/s} = {0.75/p, 0.75/q, r, 0.5/s}, replace A \u21d2 B in \u03935 by { 0.75/p, 0.75/q, r, s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, q, r, s}.\nNow, the last computed theory \u03935:\n\u03935 = {{{ 0.75/p, 0.75/q, r, s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, q, r, s},\n{0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.5/r, 0.5/s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, r, 0.5/s},\n{0.5/p, 0.5/q, 0.75/r, 0.25/s} \u21d2 {0.75/p, 0.75/q, 0.75/r, 0.25/s}}}\nis irreducible, i.e., its non-redundancy is witnessed.\nExample 3. In the last example, we present results of some experimental observations on sizes of non-redundant bases with witnessed non-redundancy computed for randomly generated formal L-contexts. Fig. 1 shows the mean sizes\nof bases computed from L-contexts with 5 object and 10 attributes. The set of truth degrees used in the experiment is an 11-element equidistant subchain of [0, 1]. The x-axis in Fig. 1 indicates the density of input data which if for I = \u3008X,Y, I\u3009 expressed in percents by\n\u2211\nx\u2208X\n\u2211\ny\u2208Y I(x, y)\n|X | \u00b7 |Y | \u00b7 100.\nThe y-axis indicates the mean number of formulas in a non-redundant base with witnessed non-redundancy. For each randomly generated L-contexts, we have computed a base using the globalization (which completely supersedes the role of \u2297 and \u2192) and identity as the hedge. In the latter case, we have used the standard Lukasiewicz and Go\u0308del operations on [0, 1]. The total number of generated formal L-contexts for the experiment is 58, 300. As it turns out, the Lukasiewicz operations with identity as the hedge yield smaller bases which is most evident if the density of the input data is about 50%. Interestingly, in most cases, the Go\u0308del operations with identity yield greater bases than in the case of globalization with the exception of sparse data sets but this may be just a deviation from a typical behavior which is due to the small size of the data. In Fig. 2, we have included the results of a similar experiment on randomly generated data with 20 objects, 50 attributes, and using 5 truth degrees. Here, even if the data is sparse, the sizes of bases for the Go\u0308del operations with identity are bigger than that for globalization. Even in this case, the Lukasiewicz operations with identity seem to produce the smallest bases. Let us note that in order to produce Fig. 2, we have used 300 randomly generated L-contexts."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "Our paper deals with transformations of sets of if-then rules describing dependencies between graded attributes which generalize the ordinary attribute implications in a setting where presence of attributes is expressed by degrees. The transformations we deal with allow us to transform a set of such dependencies into an equivalent one which is non-redundant and satisfies a stronger\ncondition of witnessed non-redundancy. The witnessed non-redundancy may be seen as a desirable property because the non-redundancy of every rule in the set can be directly observed from its antecedent. Compared to our previous results, the proposed algorithm works for arbitrary idempotent truth-stressing linguistic hedge which may serve as a parameter of interpretation of the rules. As one of the consequences of the theoretical result, we obtained that every finite objectattribute data table with graded attributes (formal L-context) admits at least one system of pseudo-intents provided that the utilized structure of degrees is finite and, in addition, it admits a system of pseudo-intents which determines a minimal base of the data table. By this, we have closed one of the open problems listed in [35]. We have also presented some initial experimental evidence that bases of if-then rules computed using different hedges than the globalization can be smaller and thus more interesting for users. Clearly, in the graded setting, the topics related to non-redundancy and minimality of bases are considerably more involved than in the classic setting and further investigation focused on theory, algorithms, and experiments is needed."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "Supported by grant no.
