Recently, these systems started using machine learning algorithms because of the progress and popularity of the artificial intelligence research field. However, choosing the suitable machine learning algorithm is difficult because of the sheer number of algorithms available in the literature. Researchers and practitioners are left with little information about the best approaches or the trends in algorithms usage. Moreover, the development of a recommender system featuring a machine learning algorithm has problems and open questions that must be evaluated, so software engineers know where to focus research efforts. This work presents a systematic review of the literature that analyzes the use of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems and identifies research opportunities for the software engineering research field. The study concluded that Bayesian and decision tree algorithms are widely used in recommender systems because of their low complexity, and that requirements and design phases of recommender system development must be investigated for research opportunities. These research opportunities are crucial because they offer a comprehensive study of recommender systems and provide detailed insights into the underlying problems and approaches to recommender system development.\n\n\n\nThe algorithm that is used to analyze the recommender system is described in a detailed explanation.\nIn the present paper, you will examine a group of recommender systems and propose ways of defining recommender system development and the use of machine learning algorithms. We summarize this proposal, which contains the basic principles of recommender system development and is the first systematic study to address the real problems of recommender systems that were first discussed. However, we will also examine how these systems can be used in the next section.\nThe implementation of recommender system development in recommender systems is a comprehensive study of recommender systems. This paper is based on a comprehensive set of research proposals of recommender system development and its implementation of recommender system development.

These systems also play an important role in decision-making, helping users to maximize profits [15] or minimize risks [11]. Today, RSs are used in many computer science companies in such as Google [35], Twitter [4], LinkedIn [50], and Netflix [59].\nThe field of RS has its origins in the mid 1990s with the introduction of Tapestry [23], the first RS. As the RS field evolved, researchers studied the use of algorithms that belonged to an artificial intelligence (AI) field called machine learning (ML). Machine learning, differently from RSs, has been under study since the late 1950s [40], with the appearance of the AI field. Today, there is a plethora of ML algorithms (knearest neighbor [48], clustering [28], Bayes network [22], to name a few), which are used in ways that range from vacuum cleaner robots [13] and disabled people assistance [30] to pattern recognition on images [63], or even self-driving vehicles [62]. The applications of ML algorithms are vast and the field is promising. As previously mentioned, ML algorithms are being used in RSs to provide users with better recommendations. However, ML field does not have a clear classification of its algorithms, mainly because of the amount of approaches and the variations that researchers propose in the literature [37]. As a consequence, it becomes difficult and confusing to choose an ML algorithm that fits one\u2019s need when developing a RS. In addition, researchers may find it challenging to observe trends in the use of ML algorithms in RSs. Software engineering (SE) is a field concerned into studying the design, development and maintenance of software [49] with tools for organization, structure, and use of computer science knowledge [27]. RS and ML fields can benefit from SE principles and definitions if studies in this direction are done. In the area of RSs with ML algorithms, researchers may not know which SE areas can have a great impact. One possible way to help researchers and practitioners to decide which ML algorithm to use on a RS, and to identify SE areas that can be improved in the development of RSs that have a ML algorithm, is the study of the RS and ML fields. Research about RSs containing ML algorithms implemented in the literature can help observe trends and draw conclusions about the future of the fields involved. Therefore, in this paper, it was decided to run a systematic review to investigate how real implemented RSs with ML algorithms are being used; which ML algorithm they use; and how SE field can impact on their development. It is expected that, with this systematic review, researchers and practitioners can obtain more information about RS field, and make better-informed implementation or research decisions. This paper is organized as follows: section 2 describes the theoretical knowledge needed; Section 3 explains the systematic review plan, and section 4 explains its results. Section 5 finishes this study with conclusions and future work."}, {"heading": "2 Theoretical Background", "text": "In this section, we give a brief overview of the fields of recommender systems and machine learning. This section is mostly concerned with introducing the fields with a quick historical description, and some field definitions and classifications."}, {"heading": "2.1 Recommender System", "text": "Recommender systems (RS) use artificial intelligence (AI) concepts to provide users item recommendations. For example, an online bookshop may use a machine learning (ML) algorithm to classify books by genre and recommend other books to a user who wants to buy a book. RSs were introduced in 1992 when Tapestry, the first RS, appeared. Its\nauthors used the term \u2018collaborative filtering\u2019 to refer to the recommendation activity. This term that is still used to classify RSs. Recommender systems are divided into three main categories, depending on the information that recommendations are based on: collaborative, content-based, and hybrid filtering [2]. RSs with a collaborative approach consider the user data when processing information for recommendation. For instance, by accessing user profiles on an online music store, the RS have access to data, such as the age, the country and city, and purchased songs of all users. With this information, the system can identify users that share the same music preference, and then suggest users songs that similar users bought. RSs with a content-based filtering approach bases their recommendations on the item data they have access to. As an example, consider a user who is looking for a new computer on an online store. When the user browses a particular computer (item), the RS gathers information about that computer and searchers in a database for computers that have similar attributes, such as price, CPU speed, and memory capacity. The result of this search is then returned to the user as recommendations. The third classification describes RSs that combines the two previous classifications into a hybrid filtering approach, recommending items based on the user and the item data. For example, on a social network, a RS may recommend profiles that are similar to the user (collaborative filtering), by comparing their interests. On a second step, the system may consider the recommended profiles as items and thus access their data to search for new similar profiles (content-based filtering). In the end, both sets of profiles are returned as recommendations. When using a collaborative or a hybrid filtering approach, RSs must gather information about the user to base recommendations on. This activity can be done explicitly or implicitly. Explicitly user data gathering happens when users provides their information and are aware of it. For instance, when registering for a new online service, users usually fill in a form that asks their name, age, and email. Other forms of explicit user data gathering are when users express their preferences by rating items either using a numerical value or with a Facebook like. Conversely, implicitly user data gathering is the activity of accessing information about the user in an indirect way. For example, when visiting an online store, the server at the online store exchanges messages with the user\u2019s computer, and based on that, the store\u2019s RS may know the browser the user is using, as well as its country. More advanced applications monitor user click and keystroke log. Besides the common recommendation process, in which users are presented with items that they might be interested in, recommendations can be done in different ways. Trustbased recommendations [45] take into consideration the trust relationship that users have between them. A trust relationship is a link in a social network either by friend or following connections. Recommendations based on trusted friends are worth more than those that do not have trust links. Context-aware recommendations [3] are done based on the context that the user is inserted. A context is a set of information about the current state of the user, such as the time at the user location (morning, afternoon, evening), or their activity (idle, running, sleeping). The amount of context information to be processed is high, making context-aware recommendations a challenging research field. Risk-aware recommendations [11] are a subset of context-aware recommendations and take into consideration a context in which critical information is available, such as user vital information. It is risk-aware because a wrong decision may threat the user life or cause\nreal life damages. Some examples are recommending pills a user should take or which stocks the user should buy, sell, or invest on."}, {"heading": "2.2 Machine Learning", "text": "Machine Learning (ML) is the AI field concerned with using computers to simulate human learning, which allows computers to identify and to acquire knowledge from the real world, and to improve its performance on some tasks based on the new knowledge. More formally, [43] defines ML as follows: \u201cA computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E\u201d. Although the first concepts of ML were coined in the 1950s, ML was studied as a separate field in the 1990s [43]. Today, ML algorithms are used in several not limited to computer science, such as business [6], advertisement [16] and medicine [32]. Learning is the process of knowledge acquisition. Humans naturally learn from experience due to the ability of reasoning. In contrast, computers do not learn with reasoning, but instead, they learn with algorithms. Today, there are a huge amount of ML algorithms proposed in literature. They can be classified based on the approach used for the learning process. There are four main classifications: supervised, unsupervised, semisupervised, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning happens when algorithms are provided with training data and correct answers. The task of the ML algorithm is to learn based on the training data, and to apply the knowledge that was gained in real data without answers. As an example consider a ML learning algorithm being used in book classification in a bookstore. A training set (training data + answers) can be a table associating information about each book to a correct classification. Here, information about each book may be title, author, or even every word a book contains. The ML algorithm learns with the training set. When a new book arrives at the bookstore, the algorithm can classify it based on the knowledge about book classification it has acquired. Differently, in unsupervised learning, ML algorithms do not have a training set. They are presented with some data about the real world and have to learn from that data on their own. Unsupervised learning algorithms are mostly concerned into finding hidden patterns in data. For example, suppose that a ML algorithm have access to user profile information in a social network. By using an unsupervised learning approach, the algorithm can separate users into personality categories, such as outgoing and reserved, allowing the social network company target advertisement for specific groups of users more efficiently. Between supervised and unsupervised learning, ML algorithms can be classified as having a semi-supervised learning. It happens when algorithms are prepared to receive a training set with missing information, and still need to learn from it. An example is when a ML algorithm is provided with movie ratings. Not every user rated every movie and thus there shall be some missing information. Semi-supervised learning algorithms are able to learn and draw conclusions even with incomplete data. Lastly, ML algorithms might have a reinforcement learning approach. It happens when algorithms learn based on an external feedback given either by a thinking entity, or the environment. This approach is analogous to teaching dogs to sit or jump. When the dog performs the action that the human asked it to do, it receives a small cookie (positive feedback). It does not receive any cookie (negative feedback) if it performs wrong or no\naction. As an example in the computer science field, consider an ML algorithm that plays games against an opponent. Moves that lead to victories (positive feedback) in the game should be learned and repeated, whereas moves that lead to losses (negative feedback) are avoided. ML became popular in recent years with the evolution of technology. As a consequence, the field now has a large number of algorithms that uses mathematical or statistical analysis to learn, draw conclusions or infer data. This number is ever increasing, because of the amount of scientific publications that propose variations or combinations of these algorithms. For that reason, academia has tried to categorize ML algorithms based on the mathematical intuitions or purposes that they present. Some results can be found on [56], and [34], although the field still do not have a standard classification."}, {"heading": "3 Systematic Review", "text": "When developing RSs, software engineers must decide which recommender algorithm to be used among several available ML algorithms. This choice has great impacts in the rationale of the RS, in the data that will be needed from users and recommendation items, and in performance issues. The number of algorithm variations and combinations in the literature turns this choice into a challenging task. In addition, software engineering research field is concerned with studying software development with the goal of improving the knowledge about the field and facilitating developer tasks with tools. As ML research field is constantly changing, new studies must be done to observe new open problems and trends, and further enrich the knowledge base about the field. The author then decided to run a systematic review to analyze the development of RS containing ML algorithms and to draw conclusions. The systematic review has two main goals: to identify which ML algorithms are used in RSs and to discover open questions in RS development that SE field can assist. The study though had one restriction. The author decided to limit the set of scientific publications to those who describe a case study, or any form of implementation. A case study is a scientific method that describes real world phenomena, either by observing or applying a new technology. In the scope of this work, the author is concerned with finding publications that were implemented and validated with real data. The restriction is formally defined as follows:\n\u2022 R1: The study investigates RS approaches that contain ML algorithms and that were implemented and tested with real or simulation data. The main reason for this restriction is that several publications in the literature propose new algorithms that are never tested or validated. These results represent noise in the conclusions, as they might never be used in real settings. The systematic review has the following two research questions (RQ):\n\u2022 RQ1: What are the most used machine learning algorithms in recommender systems?\n\u2022 RQ2: What are the software engineering areas that can help answering open questions in the development of recommender systems containing machine learning algorithms? To answer the first question, the author must read each publication returned by a search query and list the algorithms that are proposed. The strategy to answer the second\nquestion is different. First, the author limits the scope of SE areas to the five stages of the waterfall model for software lifecycle: requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance [49]. The waterfall model describes high-level stages that any software development ideally follows. Next, the author reads the conclusion and future work sections of every publication and identifies problems or research opportunities that can be investigated. Lastly, the author classifies the problem or research opportunity into one of the five software lifecycle stages. By doing it, the author expect to have a perspective of which SE area future research can be focused on. To have a set of publications with good quality and increase the strength of the conclusions, this study have some exclusion criteria (EC) that are applied to the retrieved publications prior to the reading process. They are presented below and are explained in the next paragraph.\n\u2022 EC1: Publications must have been peer-reviewed and published in a conference, journal, press, etc. Publications that were not peer-reviewed or published are excluded.\n\u2022 EC2: Publications must describe the recommender system and the machine learning algorithm sufficiently well that it is possible to identify the algorithm. Publications that do not clearly state the machine learning algorithm being used are excluded.\n\u2022 EC3: Publications must contain the description of a case study or the implementation of the approach that is proposed. Publications that do not describe a real life implementation are excluded.\n\u2022 EC4: Publications must be primarily in English. Publications in languages other than English are excluded.\n\u2022 EC5: Books, letters, notes, and patents are excluded. \u2022 EC6: Publications must be unique. If a publication is repeated, other copies of that\npublication are excluded. There are several terms to refer to RSs. Based on [29] this systematic review considers synonyms of RS terms that replace \u201crecommender\u201d by \u201crecommendation\u201d, and terms that replace \u201csystem\u201d by \u201cplatform\u201d, or \u201cengine\u201d. This systematic review does not consider any \u201cmachine learning\u201d synonyms. The following research query (RQ) was created for this systematic review:\n\u2022 RQ: TITLE-ABS-KEY(((recommender OR recommendation) PRE/0 (system OR engine OR platform)) AND \"machine learning\" AND (implementation OR \"case study\")) This research query inspects publication title, abstract and keywords and attempts to find terms that relates to the field of RS, ML, and some indication that the proposed approach was implemented. PRE/0 is a search engine-specific syntax to express the relationship between two terms. In this search query, PRE\\0 restricts the results to publications that have \u201crecommender\u201d (or its synonyms) followed by \u201csystem\u201d (or its synonyms). Publications must also contain the term \u201cmachine learning\u201d in its title, abstract, or keywords. To retrieve implemented approaches, the search query also looks for the terms \u201cimplementation\u201d or \u201ccase study\u201d. The search query was used on the popular academic search engine Scopus [54] on July 24th. It returned 35 publication entries that had to be reviewed for quality. Some\npublication entries were excluded based on the exclusion criteria previously explained, and they are summarized on Table 3.1.\nThe number of publications to be read in the systematic review decreased from 35 to 26 when filtered by the exclusion criteria. Three of the publication entries were conference or proceeding descriptions and are excluded because they are not written scientific work. The author did not have access to one publication, even after asking help for colleagues and visiting libraries. This publication then was excluded from the systematic review. Scopus seems to have a minor issue because it listed the same publication twice. However, one copy of this publication was excluded according to EC6. The remaining 30 publications were downloaded and assessed for quality. The author read the abstract and the approach description and, if present, the case study description. Based on that, one publication was excluded for not describing a case study (EC3) and three others were excluded due to poor description of the approach and the ML algorithm (EC2). In the end, 26 publications were retained and ready to be analyzed."}, {"heading": "4 Systematic Review Results", "text": "The reading process was focused into finding three pieces of information: the ML algorithm, the domain of the case study or implementation, and the problems or open questions associated with the proposed work. Therefore, after reading the abstract and the introduction, the author read the approach and case study description, and finally the conclusion or future work of each publication included in the systematic review. The author has a spreadsheet with an identification of each publication alongside three spaces for noting the pieces of information previously described. After reading all publications, the author processed the information contained in the spreadsheet and organized in a presentable manner. The results and conclusions are presented in the following paragraphs.\nProcessing ML algorithm names means that the author separated algorithms into categories based on [56]. Some algorithms had obvious classifications because they were small variations of well-established algorithms (e.g. incremental matrix factorization is a variant of the matrix factorization algorithm). However, some algorithms do not intuitively fit on any category. For these cases, the algorithm was listed under a new category with its own name (e.g. Topic Independent Scoring Algorithm is on category TISA). Table 4.1 shows the results.\ncombine several results from different algorithms into a large knowledge base and draw conclusions from it. Similar to the Bandit algorithm, the complexity of implementing and generating results impedes its growth in the RS field. While reading the 26 publications of this systematic review, the author noted that some of them described the ML algorithm with some mathematical or statistical method. For example, [12] describes a multi-armed Bandit algorithm with cosine measure. Other works described the ML algorithm in a distributed environment with Map Reduce. Table 4.2 depicts the publications that had a mathematical or statistical method, and those who used MapReduce algorithm.\nTable 4.2 - Publications that described a machine learning algorithm with a mathematical or statistical method, and publications that did it with MapReduce algorithm.\nMethod Publications Total Mathematical / Statistical [7] [8] [9] [10] [12] [14] [20] [25] [39] [53] [64]\n[67] [68] 13\nMapReduce [19] [20] [53] [61] 4 Mathematical or statistical methods are calculations such as cosine measure [18], least squares [1] or Pearson correlation [18]. They were listed separately, because ML algorithms use them to generate parameters that help in recommendations. It is expected that the great majority of publications describe a mathematical or statistical method because ML research field has its roots in these areas. MapReduce algorithm [17], which became popular in mid-1990s, is a programming model suited for distributed and parallel computation. Four of the publications described their approach in an environment which MapReduce algorithm was used. Although it was not the main algorithm, MapReduce presence shows the importance of the field of Big Data in the future of RSs. The author, when reading the case study or implementation description, noted the domains in which the publications validate their proposals. The identification of these domains enriches the knowledge of the field and help future researchers when validating their work. Table 4.3 shows the results. Note that some publications appear more than once, either in the same or in different rows. It happens because some publications reported more than one case study or implementation."}, {"heading": "TV [58] [68] 2", "text": ""}, {"heading": "SE area Publications Total", "text": "Requirements [5] 1 Design [25] [24] [55] 3 Implementation [10] [12] [19] [24] [25] [39] [61] [64] [66] 9 Verification [8] [10] [12] [20] [24] [25] [39] [51] [53] [61] [64] [67] 12 Maintenance 0 Roughly 80% of the publications describe problems or future work that focus on the implementation or verification areas. This result highlights the importance of these areas in RS development. However, limiting the search query results to publications that have a case study or an implementation description had an impact on the number of problems and future work reported. Contrarily, only four publications were concerned with problems or future work in requirements, design or maintenance of RSs. This implies that little effort is being spent on these areas and several open questions may exist."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion & Future Work", "text": "Nowadays, recommender systems (RS) are widely used in e-commerce, social network, and several other domains. Since its introduction in mid 1990s, this research field has been evolving. One progress step in RS history is the adoption of machine learning (ML) algorithms, which allow computers to learn based on user information and to further personalize recommendations. Machine learning is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) research field that encompasses algorithms whose goal is to predict the outcome of data processing. ML has major breakthroughs in the fields of image recognition, search engines, and security. However, ML field has several algorithms described in the literature, with characteristics that make them suitable for an application or not. The literature lacks a good classification of the algorithms showing the environment they are suitable to be used. Therefore, choosing a ML algorithm to be used in RSs is a difficult task. In addition, researchers do not have a clear view of the trends in ML algorithm usage for RSs to focus studies on. Software engineering (SE) is a computer science field that studies the development of computer software from conception to implementation, and maintenance, from different perspectives. The field has tools that can assist the development of RSs that contain ML algorithms. However, researchers need to know which SE area RS development lacks resources. This study then proposes a systematic review to observe the ML algorithms that are used in RSs and what SE areas can assist the development of such RSs. The systematic review collected 26 publications, after filtering out noise according to exclusion criteria. All publications were read and the conclusions are as follows. In RS development, the ML algorithm used is a Bayesian or a decision tree approach in most of the cases. Their recent popularity and the low complexity in calculations and implementation contribute for the result. Moreover, most of the approaches have a mathematical or statistical description of algorithms, since the ML field has origins in mathematics and statistics. Four of the publications have proposed RSs that work with the MapReduce algorithm. This result shows that the field of Big Data is relevant in RS studies, allowing even more personalized recommendations. During the systematic review, the author investigated the domains in which proposals of RSs with a ML algorithm were validated. The three most used domains are movies, documents, and product review, mainly because of the ease in accessing data. For the movie domain, MovieLens and IMDb are two online datasets of movie ratings. For the documents and product review domains, the author notes that text is one of the most common forms of processing data, and several ML algorithms were created for text processing. The second goal of this study concerns analyzing the development of RSs that have an ML algorithm and discover problems or open questions that SE areas can assist. The problems or open questions were found by reading the conclusion and future work sections of publications, and they were classified in one of the five areas of the Waterfall model for software lifecycle. The results show that researchers report more problems and open questions in implementation and verification areas. However, as the search question looks for study case or implementation description in the publications, this affected the results. The lack of problems or open questions reported in the other SE areas (requirements, design, and maintenance) may indicate that there are research opportunities to be investigated.\nThis study serves as a basis for investigating RS development. In the future, more studies on the use of Bayesian algorithms in RSs can be done to observe the implications of their use, performance, and utility. Moreover, RS development lacks studies analyzing early stages, such as requirements and design, and late stages, such as maintenance. Open questions in these stages must be investigated to further improve the knowledge about the field."}], "references": [{"title": "The method of least squares", "author": ["H.

Recently, these systems started using machine learning algorithms because of the progress and popularity of the artificial intelligence research field. However, choosing the suitable machine learning algorithm is difficult because of the sheer number of algorithms available in the literature. Researchers and practitioners are left with little information about the best approaches or the trends in algorithms usage. Moreover, the development of a recommender system featuring a machine learning algorithm has problems and open questions that must be evaluated, so software engineers know where to focus research efforts. This work presents a systematic review of the literature that analyzes the use of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems and identifies research opportunities for the software engineering research field. The study concluded that Bayesian and decision tree algorithms are widely used in recommender systems because of their low complexity, and that requirements and design phases of recommender system development must be investigated for research opportunities.", "creator": "Word"}}}
