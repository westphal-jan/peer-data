\u00a0 has \u00a0 long \u00a0 been \u00a0 a \u00a0 topic \u00a0 of \u00a0 tremendous \u00a0 interest \u00a0for \u00a0cognitive \u00a0science \u00a0in \u00a0general. \u00a0It \u00a0has \u00a0been

\u00a0 also \u00a0 gathered \u00a0 efforts \u00a0 in \u00a0 the \u00a0 quest \u00a0 for \u00a0 understanding \u00a0 the \u00a0 origins \u00a0 of \u00a0 language, \u00a0where \u00a0 a \u00a0 mystery \u00a0 is \u00a0 how \u00a0 linguistic \u00a0 forms \u00a0 can \u00a0 arise, \u00a0 be \u00a0 shared \u00a0 and \u00a0 evolve \u00a0 in \u00a0 a \u00a0 population \u00a0 of \u00a0 individuals \u00a0(Steels, \u00a02011; \u00a0Oudeyer, \u00a02006; \u00a0Kirby \u00a0et \u00a0al., \u00a02014; \u00a0Moulin-\u2010Frier \u00a0et \u00a0al., \u00a0in \u00a0press). \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 Across

\u00a0 learning \u00a0 architectures. \u00a0 Such \u00a0 models \u00a0 constitute \u00a0 a \u00a0 formal \u00a0 language \u00a0 allowing \u00a0 us \u00a0 to \u00a0 formulate \u00a0 and \u00a0 analyze \u00a0 precisely \u00a0 hypotheses \u00a0 about \u00a0 complex \u00a0mechanisms. \u00a0 Yet, \u00a0 an \u00a0 obstacle \u00a0 to \u00a0 scientific \u00a0 progress \u00a0 has \u00a0 been \u00a0 that \u00a0 alternative \u00a0 theories \u00a0 have \u00a0 often \u00a0 been \u00a0 expressed \u00a0 through \u00a0 different \u00a0 formal \u00a0 languages, \u00a0 making \u00a0 it \u00a0 challenging

pursued \u00a0in \u00a0several \u00a0strands \u00a0of \u00a0research, \u00a0for \u00a0example \u00a0the \u00a0theory \u00a0of \u00a0optimal \u00a0motor \u00a0control \u00a0 in \u00a0humans \u00a0and \u00a0robots \u00a0(Todorov \u00a0and \u00a0Jordan, \u00a02002). \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 However, \u00a0 experiments \u00a0 on \u00a0 passive \u00a0 dynamic \u00a0 walking \u00a0 have \u00a0 shown

\u00a0 without \u00a0 a \u00a0 motor \u00a0 and \u00a0 without \u00a0 a \u00a0 computer \u00a0 (thus \u00a0 without \u00a0 the \u00a0 possibility \u00a0 to \u00a0 make \u00a0 calculations), \u00a0 and \u00a0 reproduced \u00a0 the \u00a0 geometry \u00a0 of \u00a0 human \u00a0 legs \u00a0 (McGeer, \u00a0 1990). \u00a0 Then, \u00a0 he \u00a0 threw \u00a0 the \u00a0 robot \u00a0 on \u00a0 a \u00a0 little \u00a0 slope, \u00a0 and \u00a0 the \u00a0 robot \u00a0 walked: \u00a0 automatically, \u00a0 through \u00a0 the \u00a0 physical \u00a0 interaction \u00a0 between \u00a0 the \u00a0 various \u00a0 mechanical \u00a0 parts \u00a0 and \u00a0 gravity, \u00a0 the \u00a0 two \u00a0 legs \u00a0 generated \u00a0 a \u00a0 gait \u00a0 that \u00a0 looked \u00a0 surprisingly \u00a0 similar \u00a0 to \u00a0 a \u00a0 human \u00a0 gait, \u00a0 and \u00a0 was \u00a0 robust \u00a0 to \u00a0 disturbances. \u00a0 Other \u00a0 laboratories \u00a0 replicated \u00a0 the \u00a0 experiment \u00a0many \u00a0 times \u00a0 (Collins \u00a0 et \u00a0 al., \u00a0 2005). \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 The \u00a0 vocal \u00a0 tract \u00a0 and \u00a0 its \u00a0motor \u00a0 system \u00a0 constitute \u00a0 also \u00a0 a

\u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 One \u00a0 could \u00a0wonder \u00a0whether \u00a0 there \u00a0exists \u00a0 guiding \u00a0mechanisms \u00a0 that \u00a0 are \u00a0 specific \u00a0 to \u00a0vocal \u00a0
