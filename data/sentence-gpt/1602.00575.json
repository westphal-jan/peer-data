INTRODUCTION\nOPTIMIZATION problems that arise in communication,computation, and sensing systems have driven signal processing advances over the last several decades. Now, engineered social systems such as crowdsensing, crowdsourcing, social production, social networks, and data analytics deployments that interact with people are becoming prevalent for all of these informational tasks. Yet, they are often constructed in an ad hoc manner. Advances in signal processing theory and methods to optimize these novel human-oriented approaches to signal acquisition and processing are needed [1].\nCrowdsourcing has particularly attracted intense interest [2]\u2013[8] as a new paradigm for signal processing tasks such as handwriting recognition, paraphrase acquisition, speech transcription, image quality assessment, and photo tagging [9]\u2013 [16], that essentially all boil down to the classical statistical\nThis work was supported in part by ARO under Grant W911NF-14-1-0339 and by NSF under Grant IIS-1550145.\nQ.

An illustrative example of the proposed crowdsourcing framework.\ninference problem of M -ary classification. Unfortunately, the low quality of crowdsourced output remains a key challenge [17]\u2013[19].\nLow-quality work may arise not only because workers are insufficiently motivated to perform well [20], [21], but also because workers may lack the skills to perform the task that is posed to them [22]. Decomposing larger tasks into smaller subtasks for later aggregation allows workers lacking certain skills to contribute useful information [22], [23], by polarizing the lack of skill into a subset of subtasks.\nAs an illustrative example of lack of skill, consider the problem of mismatched crowdsourcing for speech transcription, which has garnered interest in the signal processing community [24]\u2013[30]. The basic idea is to use crowd workers to transcribe a language they do not speak, into nonsense text in their own native language orthography. There are certain phonological dimensions, such as aspiration or voicing, that are used to differentiate phonemes in one language but not another [26]. Moreover due to categorical perception that is learned in childhood, workers lacking a given phonological dimension in their native language may be unable to make relevant distinctions. That is, they lack the skill for the task.\nFig. 1 depicts the task of language transcription of Hindi. Suppose the four possibilities for a velar stop consonant to transcribe are R = { \u043a, \u0445, g, G}. The simple binary question of \u201cwhether it is aspirated or unaspirated\u201d differentiates between { \u0445, G} and { \u043a, g}, whereas the binary question of \u201cwhether it is voice or unvoiced\u201d differentiates between { g, G} and { \u043a, \u0445 }. Now suppose the first worker is a native Italian speaker. Since Italian does not use aspiration, this worker will be unable to differentiate between { \u043a} and { \u0445}, or between { g} and { G}. It would be of benefit if this worker would specify the inability to perform the task through a special symbol \u03bb, rather than guessing randomly.\n2 Suppose the second worker is a native Bengali speaker; since this language makes a four-way distinction among velar stops, such a worker will probably answer both questions without a \u03bb. Now suppose the third worker is a native speaker of Hawaiian; since this language does not use voicing, such a worker will not be able to differentiate between { \u043a} and { g}, or between { \u0445} and { G}. Hence, it would be useful if this worker answered \u03bb for the question of differentiating among these two subchoices.\nThe present paper allows workers to not respond, i.e. allowing a reject option, as in the example. Research in psychology suggests a greater tendency to select the reject option when the choice set offers several attractive alternatives but none that can be easily justified as the best, resulting in less arbitrary decisions [31]. The reject option has previously been considered in the machine learning and signal processing literatures [32]\u2013[36], but we specifically consider worker behavior and aggregation rules for crowdsourcing with a reject option. To characterize performance, we derive a closed-form expression for the probability of a microtask being correct, together with the asymptotic performance when the crowd size is large.\nSeveral methods have been proposed to deal with noisy crowd work when crowd workers are required to provide a definitive yes/no response [21]\u2013[23], [37]\u2013[41], rather than allowing a reject option. Without the reject option, noisy responses to tasks cannot be tagged before aggregation so appropriate weights cannot be assigned [37]. For instance, the popular majority voting rule weights all answers equally [42], though new weighted aggregation rules have also been developed [37], [39]. We employed error-control codes and decoding algorithms to design reliable crowdsourcing systems with unreliable workers [22]. A group control mechanism where worker reputation is used to partition the crowd into groups is presented in [40], [41]; comparing group control to majority voting indicates majority voting is more cost-effective on less complex tasks [21].\nNote that under typical crowdsourcing incentive schemes based on work volume, workers may respond to tasks for which they are not sufficiently skilled, even when a reject option is available. We therefore also consider the case where a greedy fraction of the anonymous crowd workers complete all microtasks with random guesses to maximize their rewards.\nThe main contributions of this paper are threefold. 1) We study a new crowdsourcing paradigm where\nsimilarly-difficult microtasks are performed by workers having a reject option so they can skip microtasks if they believe they cannot respond reliably. We assign a weight for every worker\u2019s response based on the number of skipped microtasks and this gives rise to significant performance improvement when compared to when all workers must respond. We also provide asymptotic performance analysis as crowd size increases. Asymptotic behavior is insightful since crowdsourcing worker pools are typically large. 2) In our weight assignment, a crowd worker\u2019s response is given more weight during aggregation if he/she responds to more microtasks. We also consider the setting where a fraction of greedy crowd workers respond to all\ntasks, first continuing to employ the oblivious strategy proposed above and investigating the error performance as a function of the fraction of greedy workers in the crowd. We then study another strategy, an expurgation strategy, where responses of workers that respond to all microtasks are discarded and the remaining workers\u2019 responses are assigned optimized weights. 3) An adaptive algorithm to switch between oblivious and expurgation strategies is derived, based on estimating several crowd parameters such as fraction of greedy workers in the crowd.\nAlthough the contributions listed above are stated for the crowdsourcing paradigm, our results hold for other signal classification tasks when decisions are made using signals that are quite uncertain. This is known as classification with a reject option [43] and has been focus of several recent studies in signal processing research including pattern recognition, image and speech classification [33], [34], [36], [44], [45]. More specifically, for a classification problem consisting of multiple (potentially unreliable) classifiers with a reject option, one can use the weighted aggregation rule where each classifier\u2019s weight is a function of its reject behavior and its reliability. Our analysis presented in this paper characterizes the asymptotic behavior of such a system."}, {"heading": "II. CLASSIFICATION TASK FOR CROWDS", "text": "Consider the situation where W workers take part in an M -ary classification task. Each worker is asked N simple binary questions, termed microtasks, which eventually lead to a decision among the M classes. We assume it is possible to construct N = \u2308log2M\u2309 independent microtasks of equal difficulty. The workers submit results that are combined to give the final decision. A worker\u2019s answer to a single microtask is represented by either \u201c1\u201d (Yes) or \u201c0\u201d (No) [22], [46] and so the wth worker\u2019s ordered answers aw(i), i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , N} to all microtasks form an N -bit word, denoted aw.\nEach worker has the reject option of skipping microtasks; we denote a skipped answer as \u03bb, whereas \u201c1/0\u201d (Yes/No) responses are termed definitive answers. Due to variability in worker expertise, the probability of submitting definitive answers is different for different workers. Let pw,i represent the probability the wth worker submits \u03bb for the ith microtask. Similarly, let \u03c1w,i be the probability aw(i), the ith answer of the wth worker, is correct given a definitive answer has been submitted. Due to worker anonymity, we study performance when pw,i and \u03c1w,i are realizations of certain probability distributions, denoted by FP (p) and F\u03c1(\u03c1), respectively. The corresponding means are denoted m and \u00b5. Let H0 and H1 denote hypotheses corresponding to bits \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d for a single microtask, respectively. For simplicity of performance analysis, \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d are assumed equiprobable for every microtask. The crowdsourcing platform or fusion center (FC) collects the N -bit words from W workers and aggregates results, as discussed next."}, {"heading": "A. Weighted Majority Voting", "text": "We first investigate weighted majority voting as the fusion rule for classification. Let us consider all object classes as\n3 elements in the set D = {ej, j = 1, 2, . . . ,M}, where ej represents the jth class. As indicated earlier, a worker\u2019s definitive responses to the microtasks determine a subset in the original set D, consisting of multiple elements/classes. If all the responses from the crowd are definitive, the final subsets are singletons and a single class is identified as the object class. Since in our framework here, some microtasks may be answered with a response \u03bb, the resulting subsets in this case will not be singletons and each element of the same corresponding subsets will have equal probability to be selected as the classification decision. Let us denote the subset determined by the definitive answers of the wth worker as Dw \u2208 D. The task manager assigns the same weight to all elements in Dw based on the wth worker\u2019s answer. With the submitted answers from W workers, we determine the overall weight assigned to any jth element of D as\nW (ej) =\nW \u2211\nw=1\nWwIDw \u3008ej\u3009, j = 1, 2, . . . ,M, Dw \u2208 D, (1)\nwhere Ww is the weight1 assigned to Dw, and IDw \u3008ej\u3009 is an indicator function which equals 1 if ej \u2208 Dw and 0 otherwise. Then the element eD with the highest weight is selected as the final class, and the classification rule is stated as\neD = arg max ej\u2208D\n{W (ej)} . (2)\nNotice that conventional majority voting requires full completion of all microtasks without the reject option and has identical Ww for each worker\u2019s decision.\nNext, we show how the problem formulated in (2) can be further decomposed.\nProposition 1: The classification rule in (2) is equivalent to a bit-by-bit decision rule as the ith bit, i = 1, . . . , N , is decided by\nW \u2211\nw=1\nWwI1 \u3008i, w\u3009 H1 \u2277 H0\nW \u2211\nw=1\nWwI0 \u3008i, w\u3009, (3)\nwhere Is \u3008i, w\u3009, s \u2208 {0, 1}, is the indicator function which is 1 if the wth worker\u2019s answer to the ith bit is \u201cs\u201d, otherwise Is \u3008i, w\u3009 = 0. For tie-breaking, randomly choose 0 or 1.\nProof: The class eD corresponds to a unique N -bit word. Thus, if the ith bit of the N -bit word corresponding to the class eD is equal to s, s has the same weight as assigned to eD, which is greater than or equal to the symbol 1\u2212 s. This gives the decision rule stated in (3)."}, {"heading": "B. Optimal Bit-by-bit Bayesian Aggregation", "text": "Let A(i) = [a1(i), a2(i), . . . , aW (i)] denote all the answers to ith microtask collected from the crowd.

(4)\n1The assignment of these weights will be discussed later in the paper.\nWe can express the likelihood ratio as\nP (H1|A(i)) P (H0|A(i)) =\nW \u220f\nw=1\nP (aw(i)|H1)\nW \u220f\nw=1\nP (aw(i)|H0)\n=\n\u220f\nS1\n(1\u2212 pw,i) \u03c1w,i \u220f\nS0\n(1\u2212 pw,i) (1\u2212 \u03c1w,i) \u220f\nS\u03bb\npw,i\n\u220f\nS1\n(1\u2212 pw,i) (1\u2212 \u03c1w,i) \u220f\nS0\n(1\u2212 pw,i) \u03c1w,i \u220f\nS\u03bb\npw,i ,\n(5)\nwhere S1 is the set of w such that aw(i) = 1, S0 is the set of w such that aw(i) = 0 and S\u03bb is the set of w such that aw(i) = \u03bb, respectively.

(6)\nNote that the optimal Bayesian criterion can also be viewed as the general weighted majority voting rule in (3) with weight Ww = log\n\u03c1w,i 1\u2212\u03c1w,i , which is also called the Chair-Varshney rule\n[47]. Note that (3) represents majority voting when Ww = 1. However, this optimal Bayesian criterion can only be used if \u03c1w,i for every worker is known a priori, which is usually not available since the crowd involved is anonymous and thus it is not possible to extract prior information such as \u03c1w,i from the answers they submit. The difficulty in obtaining prior information makes the simple majority voting scheme very effective and therefore widely used [42]. We will show later in the paper that our proposed method can be employed in practical situations and outperforms conventional majority voting. Estimation of \u03c1w,i is not needed while the mean of \u03c1w,i, \u00b5, is estimated in a practical way."}, {"heading": "C. Class-based Aggregation Rule", "text": "For the general weighted majority voting scheme where eC denotes the correct class, the probability of misclassification is\nPm = Pr (eD 6= eC)\n= Pr\n(\narg max ej\u2208D\n{\nW \u2211\nw=1\nWwIDw \u3008ej\u3009 } 6= eC )\n= 1\u2212 Pr (\narg max ej\u2208D\n{\nW \u2211\nw=1\nWwIDw \u3008ej\u3009 } = eC ) . (7)\nA closed-form expression for the error probability Pm cannot be derived without an explicit expression for Ww; hence it is difficult to determine the optimal weights to minimize Pm.\nConsequently, we consider an optimization problem based on a different objective function and propose a novel weighted majority voting method that outperforms simple majority voting. Note that eD is chosen as the decision for classification such that eD has the maximum overall weight collected from all the workers. Thus, we maximize the average overall weight assigned to the correct class while the overall weight collected by all the elements remains the same as the other existing\n4 methods such as majority voting. We state the optimization problem over the weights as\nmaximize EC [W] subject to EO [W] = K\n(8)\nwhere EC [W] denotes the crowd\u2019s average weight contribution to the correct class and EO [W] denotes the average weight contribution to all the possible classes. K is set to a constant so that we are looking for a maximized portion of weight contribution to the correct class while the weight contribution to all the classes remains fixed. This procedure ensures that one can not obtain greater EC [W] by simply increasing the weight for each worker\u2019s answer, while K results in a normalized weight assignment scheme. If two weight assignment schemes share the same value of EO [W], one can expect better performance by the scheme with higher EC [W]. Thus, K facilitates a relatively easier performance comparison of different weight assignment schemes."}, {"heading": "III. CROWDSOURCING SYSTEM WITH HONEST CROWD WORKERS", "text": "We first consider the case where the crowd is entirely composed of honest workers, which means that the workers are not greedy and honestly observe, think, and answer the questions corresponding to microtasks, and skip a question that they are not confident about. The wth worker responds with a \u03bb to the ith microtask with probability pw,i. Next, we derive the optimal weight Ww for the wth worker in this case.\nProposition 2: To maximize the normalized average weight assigned to the correct classification element, the weight for wth worker\u2019s answer is given by\nWw = \u00b5 \u2212n, (9)\nwhere \u00b5 = E[\u03c1w,i] and n is the number of definitive answers that the wth worker submits.\nProof: See Appendix A. Note that in previous works on crowdsourcing, workers were forced to make a hard decision for every single bit, which is the case when the weight derived above is set to an identical value. Here the weight depends on the number of questions answered by a worker. In fact, if more questions are answered, the weight assigned to the corresponding worker\u2019s answer is larger. In our crowdsourcing framework, if the worker believes a definitive answer can be generated, we assume that the corresponding correct probability is greater than one half. Then, a larger number of definitive answers results in a greater chance that the quality of the worker is higher than others. Increased weight can put more emphasis on the contribution of high-quality workers in that sense and improve overall classification performance."}, {"heading": "A. Estimation of \u00b5", "text": "Before the proposed aggregation rule can be used, note that \u00b5 has to be estimated to assign the weight for every worker\u2019s answers. Here, we give two approaches to estimate \u00b5.\n1) Training-based: In addition to the N microtasks, the task manager inserts additional questions to estimate the value of \u00b5 of the crowd. The answers to such \u201cgold standard\u201d questions are of course known to the manager [48], [49]. By checking the crowd worker\u2019s answers, \u00b5 can be estimated. Suppose that the first T questions are training questions, followed by N questions for classification. Let B\u0304 be the T -bit correct answers to the training questions that the manager has. First, we calculate the ratio r(w) as\nr(w) =\nT \u2211\ni=1\nI B\u0304(i) \u3008aw(i)\u3009\nI(w) , (10)\nwhere Ix\u3008y\u3009 is the indicator function which equal 1 if x = y and 0 otherwise, and I(w) =\n\u2211T i=1 (I1\u3008i, w\u3009+ I0\u3008i, w\u3009). In\norder to avoid the cases where some workers submit \u03bb for all the training questions, we estimate \u00b5 as follows\n\u00b5\u0302 = 1\nW \u2212 \u01eb\nW \u2211\nw=1\nr(w), (11)\nwhere \u01eb is the number of workers that submit all \u03bb for the training questions and the corresponding r(w) is set to 0.\n2) Majority-voting based: We use majority voting to obtain the initial aggregation result and set it as the benchmark to estimate \u00b5. First, all the answers aw(i) are collected to obtain the benchmark B(i) by traditional majority voting, where i = 1, . . . , N . Note that B(i) may contain \u03bb since it is possible that all answers aw(i) have \u03bb at the same position. Then, for the wth worker, we calculate the ratio r(w) as\nr(w) =\nN \u2211\ni=1\nIB(i) \u3008aw(i)\u3009 I (w) , (12)\nwhere we set I\u03bb\u3008\u03bb\u3009 = 0, and I(w) = \u2211N\ni=1 (I1\u3008i, w\u3009+ I0\u3008i, w\u3009).

In practice, the number of workers for the crowdsourcing task is large (in the hundreds). Thus it is of value to investigate the asymptotic system performance when W increases without bound.\nProposition 6: As the number of workers W approaches infinity, the probability of correct classification Pc can be expressed as\nPc =\n[\nQ\n(\n\u2212 M\u221a V\n)]N\n, (26)\nwhere Q(x) = 1\u221a 2\u03c0 \u222b\u221e x e \u2212t2 2 dt, and M and V are given as\nM = W (2\u00b5\u2212 1) (1\u2212m)\n\u00b5\n(\n1 \u00b5 \u2212 ( 1 \u00b5 \u2212 1 ) m )N\u22121 , (27)\nand\nV = W (1\u2212m)\n\u00b52\n(\n1 \u00b52 \u2212 ( 1 \u00b52 \u2212 1 ) m )N\u22121 \u2212 M 2 W . (28)\nProof: See Appendix E. For large but finite crowds, the asymptotic result (26) is a good characterization of actual performance. Let us therefore consider (26) in more detail. First, we rewrite (26) as\nPc =\n[\nQ\n(\n\u2212 \u221a\nW 1\nf(\u00b5,m) \u2212 1\n)]N\n, (29)\nwhere\nf (\u00b5,m) = (1\u2212m) (2\u00b5\u2212 1)2(g (\u00b5,m))N\u22121, (30) and\ng (\u00b5,m) = (1\u2212 (1\u2212 \u00b5)m)2 1\u2212 (1\u2212 \u00b52)m . (31)\nTheorem 1: The probability of correct classification in the crowdsourcing system increases with increasing size of the crowd W .\nProof: Follows from (29) as the probability of correct classification increases monotonically with respect to W .\nTheorem 2: The probability of correct classification in the crowdsourcing system increases with increasing \u00b5.\nProof: We take the partial derivative of g(\u00b5,m) with respect to \u00b5 and obtain\n\u2202g \u2202\u00b5 = 2m(1\u2212 \u00b5) (1\u2212m)A B2 , (32)\nwhere A = m\u00b5\u2212m+ 1, and B = m\u00b52 \u2212m+ 1.\n6 Clearly \u2202g \u2202\u00b5\n> 0. Recall (29), (30), and (31): a larger Pc results as \u00b5 increases. Then, the classification performance of the task in the crowdsourcing system also increases.\nTo obtain the relation between crowd\u2019s performance in terms of Pc and m, we take the partial derivative of f(\u00b5,m) with respect to m and obtain\n1 (2\u00b5\u2212 1)2 \u2202f \u2202m\n= (N \u2212 1) (1\u2212m)\n(\nA 2 ( \u00b52 \u2212 1 )\nB2 +\n2A (1\u2212 \u00b5)\nB\n)\n(\nA 2\nB\n)N\u22122\n\u2212\n(\nA 2\nB\n)N\u22121\n. (33)\nAfter some mathematical manipulations, we observe: \u2022 When m > 11+\u00b5 , we can guarantee that \u2202f \u2202m\n< 0, which means that the crowd performs better as Pc increases with decreasing m.\n\u2022 When m < 11+\u00b5 and N \u2265 (m\u00b5\u2212m+1)2 (1\u2212m)(1\u2212\u00b5)2(m\u00b5+m\u22121)+1, we\ncan guarantee that \u2202f \u2202m > 0, which means that the crowd performs better as Pc increases with increasing m.\nThese two observations indicate that a larger probability of the crowd responding to the ith microtask with \u03bb does not necessarily degrade crowd\u2019s performance in terms of the detection of the ith microtask.\nThis counterintuitive result follows since even though the crowd skips more microtasks, the optimized weight takes advantage of the number of unanswered questions and extracts more information. For this to happen, the number of microtasks N has to be greater than a lower limit. Since a larger N induces more diversity in the number of unanswered questions, the existence of the lower limit means that this diversity can actually benefit the performance using the proposed scheme."}, {"heading": "C. Simulation Results", "text": "In this subsection, we compare the performance of the proposed crowdsourcing system where crowd workers are allowed to skip microtasks with the conventional majority voting method in a hard-decision fashion, which means workers are forced to make a decision even if the workers believe that no definitive answers could be provided. The number of equiprobable classes is set as M = 8.\nFig. 2 compares performance when W = 20 workers take part in the task. We consider here that workers have a fixed pw,i for each microtask and \u03c1w,i = 0.8. We observe that performance degrades as pw,i gets larger, which means that the workers have a higher probability of not submitting an answer to the microtask. A remarkable performance improvement associated with our proposed approach is observed. The two curves converge at pw,i = 1 with Pc being equal to 0.125. At this point, with the majority-based approach, each worker gives random answers for each microtask whereas the workers using the proposed scheme skip all the questions and the tiebreaking criterion is used to pick a random bit for every microtask. In Fig. 3, we fix pw,i = 0.5 and vary \u03c1w,i to compare the resulting Pc. Notable performance improvement is also seen. The point at \u03c1w,i = 0.5 indicates that the\nworker is making a random guess even if he/she believes that he/she can complete the corresponding microtask correctly. The performance improves as \u03c1w,i gets larger, which means that the crowd is able to give higher-quality definitive answers.\nIn Fig. 4, we compare performance with different number of workers, also showing the asymptotic performance characterization. Here, we consider different qualities of the individuals in the crowd which is represented by variable pw,i with uniform distribution U(0, 1) and \u03c1w,i with U(0.6, 1). First, it is observed that a larger crowd completes the classification task with higher quality. The asymptotic curves are derived under the assumption of a very large crowd, which are the bounds on the performance of the systems. It is not a very difficult task to derive that the asymptotic performance for conventional majority voting is\nPc =\n[\nQ\n(\n\u2212 \u221a W 2(2l \u2212 1) 4l\u2212 4l2\n)]N\n,\nwhere l = \u00b5 + m(0.5 \u2212 \u00b5). Therefore, the asymptotic gap in the performance between conventional majority voting and the proposed method can also be obtained. We find that the asymptotic curves are quite a tight match to the actual performance. Again, we can see a significant improvement in Pc brought by the proposed approach.\nWe now include the estimation of \u00b5 in Fig. 5 for weight assignment. Observe in Fig. 5(a) that the performance improves as the number of workers increases and also observe that the proposed approach is significantly better than majority voting. Second, the performance of the proposed approach is significantly better than that of traditional majority voting, and it changes for different estimation settings. As is expected, a larger number of training questions result in higher performance of the system as observed in Fig. 5(b). Another interesting finding is that the performance with training based estimation can exceed that with majority voting as a benchmark only when a relatively large number of training questions are used. We can see from the figure that the \u201cTraining\u201d method with T = 10 slightly outperforms the method without training and based on \u201cMajority-voting\u201d. However, the number\nof microtasks N is only 3, which is much smaller than the training size. Quite a bit of extra overhead besides the classification task will need to be added if the training method is adopted. Hence, it is reasonable to employ \u201cMajorityvoting\u201d method together with the proposed approach for the classification task with crowdsourcing.\nFig. 6 shows the performance as a function of overhead with different numbers of microtasks, to illustrate the performance gap between the two methods. Observe that the method without training exhibits remarkable advantage in probability of correct classification Pc when a reasonable number of additional microtasks are inserted. Improved performance of the training-based method is shown when T gets larger as this results in more accurate estimation. To have comparable performance with the method without training, the trainingbased method requires even more additional microtasks when the original number of microtasks N increases. With enough microtasks inserted, the training method can outperform the one without. Again, this result encourages employing the method without training in practice.\n14.95 15 15.05 15.1 15.15 15.2\n0.776\n0.777\n0.778\n0.779\n0.78\n0.781\n0.782\n0.783\nNumber of workers W\nP c\nNo training T=10 T=5 T=1\n(b) Zoomed-in version\nFig. 5.

One uses training to insert T additional microtasks for estimation, whereas the other one uses the decision results of majority voting as a benchmark to estimate \u00b5. (a) provides the performance comparison while (b) is a zoomed-in region which is indicated in the box in (a)."}, {"heading": "IV. CROWDSOURCING SYSTEM WITH GREEDY CROWD WORKERS", "text": "In the previous section, we considered conscientious crowd workers who respond only if they have confidence in their ability to respond. In our formulation, the weight assigned to a worker\u2019s response increases with the number of microtasks that the worker responds to and this contributes to the selection of the correct class thereby enhancing classification performance. In a reward-based system, such honest workers should be compensated and actually rewarded for completing as many tasks as possible. However, if there are workers in the crowd who are greedy and their goal is to obtain as much compensation without regard to the system goal of enhanced classification performance, such a reward mechanism can encourage greedy workers to randomly complete all microtasks to get a higher reward. This would result in a degradation in the classification performance of the system. Indeed, Mason and Watts observed that increasing financial incentives increases\nthe quantity of work performed, but not necessarily the quality [50]. In this section, we study system performance when a part of the crowd completes all microtasks with random guesses. In other words, these \u201cgreedy\u201d workers submit N -bit codewords, which are termed as full-length answers in the sequel. We investigate the crowdsourcing system with such workers by assuming the correct probability for each microtask is 1/2 to represent the situation where the worker responds randomly to each microtask.\nInsertion of a gold standard question set is the most widely used method to address the issue of greedy workers. This, however, comes at the cost of a large question set to avoid workers spotting recurrent questions [48]. Besides, this is not effective in practice since one of the fundamental reasons for crowdsourcing is to collect classified labels that we do not have [49]. In this paper, we do not insert a gold standard question set and instead study two different strategies for this problem. The Oblivious Strategy continues to use the same scheme we derived in the previous section ignoring the existence of greedy workers. In the Expurgation Strategy, we discard the answers of workers who only give full-length answers, to reduce the impact of greedy workers on the overall system performance. Let \u03b1 denote the fraction of greedy workers in the crowd. Note that in this strategy, we will also discard the responses of those honest workers that provided definitive answers to all microtasks. Note the greedy workers are not being punished in any way here; only in the aggregation strategy their responses are being ignored."}, {"heading": "A.

Thus, we compare the crowd\u2019s total contribution to the correct class under this condition and derive the corresponding switching scheme. From (38) and (51), this can be expressed in (63), which can be simplified to have the switching threshold of \u03b1 as\n\u03b1\n(\n(\n1\n\u00b5\n)N\n\u2212 \u03b31 ( 1\n2\u00b5\n)N \u2212 \u03b32 + \u03b31 ) Expurgation Strategy \u2277\nOblivious Strategy \u03b31 \u2212 \u03b32,\n(64)\nwhere\n\u03b31 =\n( 1\u2212m \u00b5 + 2mx\n)N\n\u2212 ( 1\u2212m \u00b5\n)N\n, (65)\nand\n\u03b32 =\n( 1\u2212m \u00b5 + 2m\n)N\n. (66)\nTo obtain the threshold associated with \u03b1 in the switching criterion (64), \u00b5 and m should be estimated first. The previous section established a simple and effective method to estimate \u00b5 based on majority voting. Therefore, we again use majority voting to get initial detection results, which are then set as the benchmark to estimate \u00b5. Note that estimation of \u00b5 is based on the answers without the full-length ones to avoid degradation resulting from the greedy workers.\nThe performance of this integrated scheme can be derived using Propositions 7, 8 and the switching criterion (64)."}, {"heading": "D. Joint Estimation of m and \u03b1", "text": "The threshold on \u03b1 is specified based on the estimated values of m and \u00b5. Then, we estimate \u03b1 and compare it with the corresponding threshold to switch the strategies adaptively. Even though we discard the full-length answers and take advantage of the rest and estimate m, it is an inaccurate estimate because the discarded answers also contain those from the honest workers.\nSeveral works have studied the estimation of \u03b1 in crowdsourcing systems [18], [21], [41], which can be divided into two categories: one studies the behavior of the workers in comparison to the honest control group [21]; the other one learns worker\u2019s reputation profile [18], [41], which is stored and updated over time to identify the greedy ones from the crowd. However, both categories of estimation methods are not\nsuitable here due to the anonymous nature of crowd workers. The first category suffers from the difficulty in extracting the honest group from the anonymous crowd while the second requires identification of every worker.\nSince the worker\u2019s quality is assumed to be i.i.d., we give a joint parametric estimation method of both m and \u03b1 based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).\nAs defined earlier, out of W workers, qn+q\u2212n workers submit answers of n bits, 0 \u2264 n \u2264 N . Thus, the probability mass function of the number of submitted answers given m and \u03b1 is obtained in (67), where AN,n,m = ( N n )\n(1\u2212m)nmN\u2212n, is defined as the expectation of the probability of a single worker submitting n definitive answers.\nBecause of the independence of workers, we can form the likelihood statistic as\nL (m,\u03b1) =\nN \u2211\nn=0\nlogf (qn + q\u2212n|m,\u03b1) . (68)\nTherefore, the ML estimates of m and \u03b1, which are denoted by m\u0302 and \u03b1\u0302, can be obtained as\n{m\u0302, \u03b1\u0302} = arg max {m,\u03b1}\u2208[0,1] L (m,\u03b1) . (69)\nOnce we have \u00b5\u0302, m\u0302 and \u03b1\u0302, we can adaptively switch to the suitable strategy using (64)."}, {"heading": "E. Simulation Results", "text": "Now, we present some simulation results to illustrate the performance of our proposed algorithm. First, the theoretical value of the threshold for adaptive switching between the strategies is obtained for different values of m and \u00b5 based on (64). We switch to the Expurgation Strategy if the fraction of greedy workers \u03b1 is greater than the threshold. Otherwise we stick to the Oblivious Strategy. As we can observe from Figure 7, when m decreases and \u00b5 increases, which means the quality of the crowd improves, the threshold increases. This implies that the crowdsourcing system employing the Oblivious Strategy can tolerate a higher fraction of greedy workers in the crowd and, therefore, instead of discarding all the answers from the greedy workers and a part from the honest workers who submit full-length answers, it is better to keep them as long as the honest ones can perform well. The effect of greedy workers\u2019 answers can be compensated by the high-quality answers of the honest workers in the crowd.\nNext, we give the estimation results for \u03b1\u0302 in Table I using the proposed MLE method. The crowd quality parameters pw,i and \u03c1w,i are drawn from distributions U(0, 1) and U(0.5, 1) respectively.

Once it has obtained \u00b5\u0302 and m\u0302, the system calculates the threshold value and compares it with \u03b1\u0302, and then decides the strategy to be used. Next, the system allocates weights to the answers for aggregation based on the strategy selected and makes the final classification decision. In Fig. 8, we present the performance of both the strategies and the estimated threshold for switching is also presented. The performance deterioration caused by greedy workers is quite obvious as the probability of correct classification Pc decreases for both strategies with increasing \u03b1. The intersection of curves illustrates the need for strategy switching. The estimated Pareto frontier \u03b1\u0302 for switching is 0.3369 in this system setting, which is indicated in the figure by a line segment and is very close to the intersection of the two curves. Therefore, the actual performance curve of the proposed algorithm consists of the curve with squares when \u03b1 < \u03b1\u0302 and curve with circles when \u03b1 > \u03b1\u0302."}, {"heading": "V.

Performance of both the strategies with greedy workers\nperformance. We have shown our proposed approach significantly outperforms traditional majority voting and provided asymptotic performance characterization as an upper bound on performance. Further, we considered greedy workers in the crowd. An oblivious and an expurgation strategy were studied to deal with greed, and an algorithm to adaptively switch between the two strategies, based on the estimated fraction of greedy workers in the anonymous crowd, was developed to combat performance degradation.\nWe assumed in this paper that the workers\u2019 qualities are identically distributed. In some cases, it is possible that the workers\u2019 qualities are not identically distributed, which makes estimating the greedy fraction \u03b1 difficult. The difficulty of microtasks might not be equal, which makes the microtask design quite challenging. Therefore, further research directions include the development of a general model to characterize the crowd quality, design of a robust method to estimate the fraction of greedy workers in the crowd, and binary microtask design with a reject option."}, {"heading": "APPENDIX A", "text": "To solve problem (8), we need EC [W] and EO[W].

(75)\nThen we maximize the crowd\u2019s average weight corresponding to the correct class under the constraint \u222b\npw,i Pr(pw,i =\nx)dx = 1, and the maximization problem is written as\nA = Ep[Aw(pw,i)] =\n\u222b\npw,i\n\u03b1w(pw,i) Pr (pw,i = x) dx\n\u2264 \u221a \u221a \u221a\n\u221a\n\u222b\npw,i\n\u03b12w(pw,i) Pr (pw,i = x) dx\n\u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a \u222b\npw,i\nPr (pw,i = x) dx\n(76)\n, \u03b2.

Then from (75), we have\nE\u03c1 [Ww\u03c1 (n)] = \u03b2. (79)\nSince \u03c1(n) is the product of n variables, its distribution is not known a priori.

Crowd workers complete simple binary microtasks whose results are aggregated to give the final result. We consider the novel scenario where workers have a reject option so they may skip microtasks when they are unable or choose not to respond. For example, in mismatched speech transcription, workers who do not know the language may not be able to respond to microtasks focused on phonological dimensions outside their categorical perception. We present an aggregation approach using a weighted majority voting rule, where each worker\u2019s response is assigned an optimized weight to maximize the crowd\u2019s classification performance. We evaluate system performance in both exact and asymptotic forms. Further, we consider the setting where there may be a set of greedy workers that complete microtasks even when they are unable to perform it reliably. We consider an oblivious and an expurgation strategy to deal with greedy workers, developing an algorithm to adaptively switch between the two based on the estimated fraction of greedy workers in the anonymous crowd. Simulation results show improved performance compared with conventional majority voting.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
