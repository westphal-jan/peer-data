Introduction", "text": "The massive growth of available data has moved data analysis and machine learning to center stage in many industrial as well as scientific fields, ranging from web and sensor data to astronomy, health science, and countless other applications. With the increasing size of datasets, machine learning methods are limited by the scalability of the underlying optimization algorithms to train these models, which has spurred significant research interest in recent years.\nHowever, practitioners face a significant problem arising with the larger model complexity in large-scale machine learning and in particular deep-learning methods - it is increasingly hard to diagnose if the optimization algorithm used for training works well or not. With the optimization algorithms also becoming more complex (e.g. in a distributed setting), it can often be very hard to pin down if bad performance of a predictive model either comes from\nslow optimization, or from poor modeling choices. In this light, easily verifiable guarantees for the quality of an optimization algorithm are very useful \u2014 note that the optimum solution of the problem is unknown in most cases. For convex optimization problems, a primal-dual gap can serve as such a certificate. If available, the gap also serves as a useful stopping criterion for the optimizer.\nSo far, the majority of popular optimization algorithms for learning applications comes without a notion of primaldual gap. In this paper, we aim to change this for a relevant class of machine learning problems. We propose a primaldual framework which is algorithm-independent, and allows to equip existing algorithms with additional primaldual certificates as an add-on.\nOur approach is motivated by the recent analysis of SDCA (Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang, 2013). We extend their setting to the significantly larger class of convex optimization problems of the form\nmin \u03b1\u2208Rn f(A\u03b1) + g(\u03b1)\nfor a given matrix A \u2208 Rd\u00d7n, and f , g being convex functions, not necessarily continuous. This problem class includes the most prominent regression and classification methods as well as generalized linear models. We will formalize the setting in more details in Section 3, and highlight the associated dual problem, which has the same structure.\nContributions. The main contributions in this work can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 Our new primal-dual framework is algorithmindependent, that is it allows users to equip existing algorithms with primal-dual certificates and convergence rates.\nar X\niv :1\n60 2.\n05 20\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n6 Fe\n\u2022 Compared with the well-known duality setting of SDCA (Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang, 2013; 2014) which is restricted to strongly convex regularizers and finite sum optimization problems, our framework encompasses a significantly larger class of problems. We obtain new primal-dual convergence rates e.g. for the Lasso as well as many L1, Elastic-Net and grouplasso-regularized problems. The theory applies to any norm-regularized generalized linear model. \u2022 Moreover, the primal-dual guarantees for the class of ERM problems with Lipschitz loss from (ShalevShwartz & Zhang, 2013) (e.g. SVM) are valid only for some \u201caverage\u201d iteration. We show, that the same rate of convergence can be achieved e.g. for accelerated SDCA, but without necessity of computing an average over last samples. \u2022 We introduce a new Lipschitzing trick allowing duality gaps which are globally defined, without modifying the original problems in the region of interest. Therefore, in contrast to existing methods adding a small strongly-convex (L2) term as e.g. in (ShalevShwartz & Zhang, 2014; Zhang & Lin, 2015), our approach leaves both the algorithms and the optima unaffected. \u2022 Our primal-dual theory captures a more precise notion of data-dependency compared with existing results (which relied on per-coordinate information only). To be precise, our shown convergence rate for the general algorithm is depending on the the spectral norm of the data, see also (Taka\u0301c\u030c et al., 2013; 2015)."}, {"heading": "2. Related Work", "text": "Linearized ADMM solvers. For the problem structure of our interest here, one of the most natural algorithms is the splitting method known as the Chambolle-Pock algorithm (also known as Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient, or linearized ADMM) (Chambolle & Pock, 2010). While this algorithm can give rise to a duality gap, it is significantly less general compared to our framework. In each iteration, it requires a complete solution of the proximal operators of both f and g, which can be computationally expensive. Its convergence rate is sensitive to the used step-size (Goldstein et al., 2015). Our framework is not algorithm-specific, and holds for arbitrary iterate sequences. More recently, the SPDC method (Zhang & Lin, 2015) was proposed as a coordinatewise variant of the method of (Chambolle & Pock, 2010), for the case of strongly convex g.\nStochastic coordinate solvers. Coordinate descent/ascent methods have become state-of-the-art for many machine learning problems (Hsieh et al., 2008; Friedman et al., 2010). In recent years, theoretical convergence rate guarantees have been developed for the primal-only setting e.g. by (Nesterov, 2012; Richta\u0301rik & Taka\u0301c\u030c, 2014), as\nwell as more recently also for primal-dual guarantees, see e.g. (Lacoste-Julien et al., 2013; Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang, 2013; 2014). The influential Stochastic1 Dual Coordinate Ascent (SDCA) framework (Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang, 2013) was motivated by the L2 regularized SVM, where coordinate descent is very efficient on the dual SVM formulation, with every iteration only requiring access to a single datapoint (i.e. a column of the matrix A in our setup). In contrast to primal stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods, the SDCA algorithm family is often preferred as it is free of learning-rate parameters, and has a fast linear (geometric) convergence rate. SDCA and recent extensions (Taka\u0301c\u030c et al., 2013; Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang, 2014; Qu et al., 2014; Shalev-Shwartz, 2015; Zhang & Lin, 2015) require g to be strongly convex.\nUnder the weaker assumption of weak strong convexity (Necoara, 2015), a linear rate for the primal-dual convergence of SDCA was recently shown by (Ma et al., 2015c).\nIn the Lasso literature, a similar trend in terms of solvers has been observed recently, but with the roles of primal and dual problems reversed. For those problems, coordinate descent algorithms on the primal formulation have become the state-of-the-art, as in GLMNET (Friedman et al., 2010) and extensions (Shalev-Shwartz & Tewari, 2011; Yuan et al., 2012; 2010). Despite the prototypes of both problem types\u2014SVM for the L2-regularized case and Lasso for the L1-regularized case\u2014being closely related (Jaggi, 2014), we are not aware of existing primal-dual guarantees for coordinate descent methods on unmodified L1-regularized problems.\nComparison to smoothing techniques. Existing techniques for bringing L1-regularized and related problems into a primal-dual setting compatible with SDCA do rely on the classical Nesterov-smoothing approach (also known as the excessive gap technique) (Nesterov, 2005; Tran-Dinh & Cevher, 2014b). By adding a small amount of L2 to the part g, the objective becomes strongly convex; see, e.g., (Nesterov, 2012; Richta\u0301rik & Taka\u0301c\u030c, 2014; ShalevShwartz & Zhang, 2014; Zhang & Lin, 2015). However, the appropriate strength of smoothing is difficult to tune for the user. It will depend on the accuracy level, and will influence the choice of algorithms. Also, it will change the iterates, the resulting convergence rate as well as the tightness of the resulting duality gap. The line of work of Tran-Dinh & Cevher (2014a; 2015) provides duality gaps for the smooth version of any convex objective. Furthermore, primal-dual convergence rates follow for the case of proximally tractable objectives (Tran-Dinh & Cevher, 2015) and also objectives having an efficient Fenchel-type operator (Yurtsever et al., 2015), where per iteration, the\n1Here \u2019stochastic\u2019 refers to randomized selection of the active coordinate.\nproximal or Fenchel problems for f and g need to be solved to a sufficient level of accuracy. In contrast, our approach doesn\u2019t assume proximal or Fenchel tractability, and preserves all solutions of the original L1-optimization. Our approach leaves the iterate sequences of arbitrary existing algorithms unchanged, which is desirable in practice, allows the reusability of well-tuned existing solvers, and removes the need of tuning another parameter.\nDistributed setting. For L1-optimization with datasets exceeding the memory capacity of a single computer, we study distributed schemes leveraging the Lipschitzing trick in (Smith et al., 2015; Forte, 2015)."}, {"heading": "3. Setup and Primal-Dual Structure", "text": "In this paper, we consider optimization problems of the following primal-dual structure. As we will see, the relationship between primal and dual objectives has many benefits, including computation of the duality gap, which allows us to have certificates for the approximation quality.\nWe consider the following pair of optimization problems, which are dual2 to each other:\nmin \u03b1\u2208Rn\n[ D(\u03b1) := f(A\u03b1) + g(\u2212\u03b1)\n] , (A)\nmin w\u2208Rd\n[ P(w) := f\u2217(w) + g\u2217(ATw) ] . (B)\nThe two problems are associated to a given data matrixA \u2208 Rd\u00d7n, and the functions f : Rd \u2192 R and g : Rn \u2192 R are allowed to be arbitrary closed convex functions. Here \u03b1 \u2208 Rn and w \u2208 Rd are the respective variable vectors. The relation of (A) and (B) is called Fenchel-Rockafellar Duality where the functions f\u2217, g\u2217 in formulation (B) are defined as the convex conjugates3 of their corresponding counterparts f, g in (A).\nThe two main powerful features of this general duality structure are first that it includes many more machine learning methods than more traditional duality notions, and secondly that the two problems are fully symmetric, when changing respective roles of f and g. In typical machine learning problems, the two parts typically play the roles of a data-fit (or loss) term as well as a regularization term. As we will see later, those two roles can be swapped, depending on the application.\nOptimality Conditions. The first-order optimality conditions for our pair of vectors w \u2208 Rd,\u03b1 \u2208 Rn in problems (A) and (B) are given as\nw \u2208 \u2202f(A\u03b1) , (1a) A\u03b1 \u2208 \u2202f\u2217(w) , (1b)\nATw \u2208 \u2202g(\u2212\u03b1) , (2a) \u2212\u03b1 \u2208 \u2202g\u2217(ATw) (2b)\n2For a self-contained derivation see Appendix C. 3h\u2217(v) := maxu\u2208Rd v Tu\u2212 h(u).\nsee e.g. (Bauschke & Combettes, 2011, Proposition 19.18), when applying their theorem twice, swapping the roles of primal and dual problems. The stated optimality conditions are equivalent to \u03b1,w being a saddle-point of the Lagrangian, which is given as L(\u03b1,w) = f\u2217(w) \u2212 \u3008A\u03b1,w\u3009 \u2212 g(\u2212\u03b1) if \u2212\u03b1 \u2208 dom(g) and w \u2208 dom(f\u2217).\nDuality Gap. From the definition of the dual problems in terms of the convex conjugates, we always have P(w) \u2265 P(w?) \u2265 \u2212D(\u03b1?) \u2265 \u2212D(\u03b1), giving rise to the definition of the general duality gap G(w,\u03b1) := P(w)\u2212 (\u2212D(\u03b1)).\nFor differentiable f , the duality gap can be used more conveniently: Given \u03b1 \u2208 Rn s.t. A\u03b1 \u2208 dom(f) in the context of (A), a corresponding variable vector w \u2208 Rd for problem (B) is given by the first-order optimality condition (1a) as\nw = w(\u03b1) := \u2207f(A\u03b1) . (3)\nUnder strong duality, we have P(w?) = \u2212D(\u03b1?) and w(\u03b1?) = w?, where \u03b1? is an optimal solution of (A). This implies that the suboptimality P(w(\u03b1)) \u2212 P(w?) is always bounded above by the simpler duality gap function\nG(\u03b1):=P(w(\u03b1))\u2212(\u2212D(\u03b1))\u2265 P(w(\u03b1))\u2212 P(w?) (4) which hence acts as a certificate of the approximation quality of the variable vector \u03b1.\nAssumption 1. Throughout the paper we will assume that\n1. Strong duality holds, e.g., AT dom(f)\u2229 cont(g) 6= \u2205, where cont(g) are the points where g is continuous; 2. The function f\u2217 is \u03b2-strongly convex with respect to the standard Euclidean norm.\nThose assumptions are satisfied for the majority of classic machine learning methods. Table 1 gives an overview over some popular examples, and explains how they are formulated either as problem (A) or (B)."}, {"heading": "4.

This results is consistent with a work (Hush et al., 2006) shown only for SVMs. Hence our result is much more general as it holds for any L-Lipschitz continuous convex function g\u2217 and any \u03b2-strongly convex function f\u2217.\nLet us make one more important remark. In (ShalevShwartz & Zhang, 2013) the authors showed that SDCA (when applied on L-Lipschitz continuous g\u2217) has D(t) \u223c O(t) and they also showed that an averaged solution (over few last iterates) needs only O( \u22121) iterations to have duality gap \u2264 . However, as a direct consequence of our Theorem 4 we can show e.g. that FISTA (Beck & Teboulle, 2009) (aka. accelerated gradient descent algorithm) or APPROX (Fercoq & Richta\u0301rik, 2015)5 (a.k.a. accelerated coordinate descent algorithm) will need O( \u22121) iterations to\n5For APPROX it is required that g is separable, such as for SVM or logistic loss.\nproduce an iterate \u03b1 such that G(\u03b1) \u2264 . Indeed, e.g. for APPROX the functionD(t) = ((t\u22121)\u03c4+2n)2 (where \u03c4 is the size of a mini-batch) and C is a constant which depends on \u03b1(0) and \u03b1? and \u03c4 . Hence, to obtain an iterate \u03b1(t) such that E[G(\u03b1(t))] \u2264 it is sufficient to choose \u03c4 \u2265 1 such that t (11) \u2265 1\u2212 2n\u03c4 + max{ 1 \u03c4 \u221a 2C\u03b2 \u03c3L2 , L \u03c4 \u221a 2C\u03c3 \u03b2 } is satisfied."}, {"heading": "5. Extending Duality to Non-Lipschitz Functions", "text": ""}, {"heading": "5.1. Lipschitzing Trick", "text": "In this section we present a trick that allows to generalize our results of the previous section from Lipschitz functions g\u2217 to non-Lipschitz functions. The approach we propose, which we call the Lipschitzing trick, will make a convex function Lipschitz on the entire domain Rd, by modifying its conjugate dual to have bounded support. Formally, the modification is as follows: Let B \u2282 Rd be some closed, bounded convex set. We modify g : Rn \u2192 R by restricting its support to the set B, i.e.\ng\u0304(\u03b1) := { g(\u03b1) if \u03b1 \u2208 B +\u221e otherwise . (12)\nBy definition, this function has bounded support, and hence, by Lemma 5, its conjugate function g\u0304\u2217 is Lipschitz continuous.\nMotivation. We will apply this trick to the part g of optimization problems of the form (A) (such that g\u2217 will become Lipschitz). We want that this modification of the optimization problem will have no impact on the outcome of any optimization algorithm running on (A). Instead, the trick will only affects the convergence theory in that it allows us to present a strong primal-dual rate. In the following, we will discuss how this can indeed be achieved by imposing only very weak assumptions on the original problem (A), and any monotone optimization algorithm.\nThe modification is based on the following known duality of Lipschitzness and bounded support, as given in Lemma 5 below. We need the following definition: Definition 1 (B-Bounded Support). A function g : Rd \u2192 R has B-bounded support if its effective domain is bounded by B w.r.t. a norm \u2016.\u2016, i.e.,\ng(u) < +\u221e \u21d2 \u2016u\u2016 \u2264 B . (13) Lemma 5 (Duality between Lipschitzness and L-Bounded Support, (Rockafellar, 1997, Corollary 13.3.3)). Given a proper convex function g, it holds that g isL-Lipschitz (w.r.t the L2-norm) if and only if g\u2217 has L-bounded support (w.r.t the L2-norm).\nHence we can state Theorem 6 generalizing previous results for Lipschitz functions g\u2217.\nTheorem 6. For an arbitrary optimization algorithm running on problem (A), let \u03b1(t) denote its iterate sequence. Assume there is some closed convex set B containing all these iterates. Then, the same optimization algorithm run on the modified problem \u2014 given by Lipschitzing of g\u2217 using B \u2014 would produce exactly the same iterate sequence.

Norm-Regularized Problems", "text": "We now focus on some applications. First, we demonstrate how the Lipschitzing trick can be applied to find primaldual convergence rates for problems regularized by an arbitrary norm. We discuss in particular the Lasso problem and show how the suboptimality bound can be evaluated in practice. In a second part, we discuss the elastic net regularizer and show how it fits into our framework.\nWe consider a special structure of problem (A), namely\nmin \u03b8\u2208Rp\n`(X\u03b8) + \u03bb \u2016\u03b8\u2016 . (14)\nwhere ` is some convex non-negative loss function. We choose B to be the L2-norm ball of radius B.

Remark 1. In case of least squares loss we can choose B := C 12\u03bb\u2016b\u2016 2 2 and for the logistic regression loss B := Cm\u03bb log(2) is a save choice.\nDuality Gap. For any problem of the form (14) we can now determine the duality gap. We apply the Lipschitzing trick to g(\u2212\u03b1) := \u03bb\u2016\u03b1\u2016 as in (12), then the convex conjugate of g\u0304 is given by\ng\u0304\u2217(u) = 0 \u2016u\u2016\u2217 \u2264 \u03bbmax \u03b1:\u2016\u03b1\u20162\u2264B uT\u03b1\u2212 \u03bb\u2016\u03b1\u2016 else . (15)\nwhere \u2016.\u2016\u2217 denotes the dual norm of \u2016.\u2016. Hence, using the optimality condition (1a) we can write the duality gap of the modified problem as\nG\u0304(\u03b1) = (A\u03b1)T\u2207f(A\u03b1) + \u03bb\u2016\u03b1\u2016+ g\u0304\u2217(ATw(\u03b1)) (16) Remark 2. The original duality gap G(\u03b1) is only defined on the set { \u03b1 : \u2016ATw(\u03b1)\u2016\u2217 \u2264 \u03bb } , where for \u03b1 \u2208 B it is equivalent to G\u0304(\u03b1). But, in contrast to the unmodified duality gap, our new gap G\u0304(\u03b1) is defined on the entire space Rd.\n5.2.1. L1-REGULARIZED PROBLEMS\nWe consider the following special case of (14):\nmin \u03b8\u2208Rp `(X\u03b8) + \u03bb \u2016\u03b8\u20161 , (17)\nwhere X \u2208 Rm\u00d7p is the data matrix and ` is some nonnegative smooth function. In the following we will use our framework and the results established in the previous sections to give primal/dual convergence rates for any algorithm applied to (17). To do so, we map (17) to our setting (A) as proposed in row 1 of Table 1 where, A := X \u2208 Rm\u00d7p and \u03b1 := \u03b8 \u2208 Rp.\nWe choose B to be the L2-norm ball of radius B := 1\u03bb`(0). As we have seen in Section 5.2 B contains all iterates of any monotone algorithm (initialized at \u03b8 = 0) applied to (17) and hence the Lipschitzing trick with B can be applied without modifying the optimization (17). An illustration of this modification as well as the impact on its dual are illustrated in Figure 1.\nRemark 3.

In the first case \u03b8 is mapped to \u03b1 and in the second case to w. As D consists of a strongly convex and a smooth term in both scenarios Theorem 2 gives strong convergence guarantees for either of these. The choice if a dual or primal optimization algorithm will be more beneficial in practice will depend on the application. We will discuss this choice in more detail for coordinate descent methods in Section 6.\nDuality Gap. For the elastic net problem in (19) we can compute the duality gap (4) as follows: G(\u03b8) = (X\u03b8)T\u2207`(X\u03b8) + 12\u03b7\u03bb n\u2211 i=1\n[\u2223\u2223XT:iw\u2223\u2223\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b7)\u03bb]2+ + \u03bb ( \u03b7 2\u2016\u03b8\u2016 2 2 + (1\u2212 \u03b7)\u2016\u03b8\u20161\n) for the derivation, see Appendix H.\nRemark 4. As \u03b7 \u2192 0 we approach the pure L1-case and this gap blows up as G(\u03b8) \u2192 \u221e.

We recover Theorem 2 in (Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang, 2013) as a special case of Theorem 9. Therefore, we consider the optimization objectives in (40) and (41). We assume that \u03a6i(\u03b1) is M -Lipschitz for i \u2208 [n] and \u03a6i(0) \u2264 1. We scale the columns of X such that \u2016xi\u2016 \u2264 1.

We consider (40) and (41) as a special case (SB) and (SA). We set gi(\u03b1) := 1n\u03a6 \u2217 i (\u03b1) and f \u2217(w) := \u03bb2 \u2016w\u2016 2. Hence, g\u2217i (w Tai) = 1 n\u03a6i(nw\nTai) is M -Lipschitz and we set L := M and \u03b2 := \u03bb We further use Lemma (Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang, 2013, Lemma 20) with \u03a6i(0) \u2264 1 to bound the primal suboptimality as (0)D \u2264 1. Finally, by the assumption \u2016xi\u2016 \u2264 1 and the definition A := 1nX we have R := 1 n and applying Theorem 9 to this setting concludes the proof.\nI.3. Proof of Lemma 14\nTo prove of Lemma 14 is motivated by the proof of (Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang, 2013, Lemma 19) but we adapt it to apply to a much more general setting. First note that the one step improvement in the dual objective can be written as\nD(\u03b1(t\u22121))\u2212D(\u03b1(t)) = n\u2211 i=1 gi(\u2212\u03b1(t\u22121)i ) + f(A\u03b1 (t\u22121))\u2212 [ n\u2211 i=1 gi(\u2212\u03b1(t)i ) + f(A\u03b1 (t)) ] Note that in a single step of SDCA \u03b1(t\u22121) \u2192 \u03b1(t) only one dual coordinate is changed. Without loss of generality we assume this coordinate to be i. Writing v(\u03b1) = A\u03b1, we find\nD(\u03b1(t\u22121))\u2212D(\u03b1(t)) = [ gi(\u2212\u03b1(t\u22121)i ) + f(v(\u03b1 (t\u22121))) ]\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 (\u0393)\n\u2212 [ gi(\u2212\u03b1(t)i ) + f(v(\u03b1 (t))) ]\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 (\u039b) .\nIn the following, let us denote the columns of the matrix A by ai for i \u2208 [n] for reasons of readability. Then, by definition of the update we have for all s \u2208 [0, 1]:\n(\u039b) = gi(\u2212\u03b1(t)i ) + f(v(\u03b1 (t)))\n= min \u2206\u03b1i\n[ gi(\u2212(\u03b1(t\u22121)i + \u2206\u03b1i)) + f(v(\u03b1 (t\u22121) + ei\u2206\u03b1i)) ]\n= min \u2206\u03b1i\n[ gi(\u2212(\u03b1(t\u22121)i + \u2206\u03b1i)) + f ( v(\u03b1(t\u22121)) + ai\u2206\u03b1i )] \u2264 [ gi(\u2212(\u03b1(t\u22121)i + s(u (t\u22121) i \u2212 \u03b1 (t\u22121) i ))) + f ( v(\u03b1(t\u22121)) + ais(u (t\u22121) i \u2212 \u03b1 (t\u22121) i )\n)] where we chose \u2206\u03b1i = s(u (t\u22121) i \u2212 \u03b1 (t\u22121) i ) with \u2212u (t\u22121) i \u2208 \u2202g\u2217i (aTi w(t\u22121)) for s \u2208 [0, 1]. For the sake of simplicity we omit the superscripts and subscripts for the following calculations.

Similarly, by again exploiting the primal-dual optimality condition we have f\u2217(\u2207f(v)) = vT\u2207f(v) \u2212 f(v) and hence we can write the duality gap as:\nG(\u03b1) = P(w)\u2212 (\u2212D(\u03b1)) = n\u2211 i=1 g\u2217i (a T i w) + f \u2217(w)\u2212\n[ \u2212\nn\u2211 i=1 gi(\u2212\u03b1i)\u2212 f(A\u03b1)\n]\n= n\u2211 i=1 [ g\u2217i (a T i w) + gi(\u2212\u03b1i) ] + f\u2217(w) + f(A\u03b1)\n= n\u2211 i=1 [ g\u2217i (a T i w) + gi(\u2212\u03b1i) ] + (A\u03b1)Tw\n= n\u2211 i=1 [ g\u2217i (a T i w) + gi(\u2212\u03b1i) + \u03b1iaTi w ] using this we can write the expectation of (44) with respect to i as\nE [ D(\u03b1(t\u22121))\u2212D(\u03b1(t)) ] \u2265 s ( 1 n E [ G(\u03b1(t\u22121)) ]) \u2212 s 2 2 [ 1 n n\u2211 i=1 E [ (u (t\u22121) i \u2212 \u03b1 (t\u22121) i ) 2 ]( 1 \u03b2 \u2016ai\u20162 \u2212 (1\u2212 s)\u00b5 s )] \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nF (t)\n.\nAnd we have obtained that E [ D(\u03b1(t\u22121))\u2212D(\u03b1(t)) ] \u2265 s n E [ G(\u03b1(t\u22121)) ] \u2212 s 2 2 F (t). Corollary 19. We recover Lemma 19 in (Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang, 2013) as a special case of Lemma 14.

As our algorithm works for any data matrix A, we choose A := 1 nX and scale the input vectors xi, i.e. ai = xin before we feed ai into the algorithm.

The group lasso regularizer is a norm on Rn, and is defined as g(\u03b1) = \u03bb \u2211 k \u2016\u03b1Gk\u20162,\nfor a fixed partition of the indices into disjoint groups, {1..n} = \u228e k Gk. Here \u03b1Gk \u2208 R|g| denotes the part of the vector \u03b1 with indices in the group g \u2286 [n]. Its dual norm is maxg\u2208G \u2016\u03b1(g)\u20162. Therefore, by Lemma 13, we obtain the conjugate g\u2217(y) = \u03b9{y | maxg\u2208G \u2016\u03b1(g)\u20162\u2264\u03bb}(y)\nSee e.g. (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004, Example 3.26).\nLogistic Loss. Lemma 21 (Conjugate and Smoothness of the Logistic Loss). The logistic classifier loss function f given as\nf(A\u03b1) := d\u2211 j=1 log (1 + exp (\u2212bjyTj \u03b1)) ,\nis the conjugate of f\u2217, which is given as:\nf(w) := d\u2211 j=1 ( (1 + wjbj) log (1 + wjbj)\u2212 wjbj log (\u2212wjbj) ) , (48)\nwith the box constraint \u2212wjbj \u2208 [0, 1].\nFurthermore, f\u2217(w) is 1-strongly convex over its domain if the labels satisfy bj \u2208 [\u22121, 1].\nK.
