In the following case, each method is either the logical and (in this case) the functional equivalent of a set of functions. In the context of the logical model, the logic model can be defined using a specific type of model or model.

Dung showed that argumentation inference can be regarded as a logic programming inference with negation as failure (Dung 1995). In his seminal paper (Dung 1995), Dung introduced four argumentation semantics: grounded, stable, preferred and complete semantics. Currently, it is known that these four argumentation semantics introduced by Dung can be regarded as logic programming inferences by using different mappings, from argumentation frameworks (AFs) into logic programs, and different logic programming semantics (see Section 4).\nFollowing Dung\u2019s argumentation style, several new argumentation semantics have been proposed. Among them, ideal, semi-stable, stage and CF2 have been deeply explored (Baroni et al. 2011). Semi-stable and stage semantics were introduced from different points of view; however, they have been defined in terms of the so-called ranges of complete extensions and conflict-free sets, respectively. It seems that by using the concept of range, one can define different classes of argumentation semantics as is the case with the semi-stable\nand stage semantics. Given that the concept of range seems a fundamental component of definitions of argumentation semantics such as semi-stable and stage semantics, the following question arises:\n[Q1] How the concept of range can be captured from the logic programming point of view?\nThis question takes relevance in the understanding of argumentation as logic programming.\nIn this paper, we argue that for capturing the idea of range from the logic programming point view, logic programming reductions which have been used for defining logic programming semantics such as stable model (Gelfond and Lifschitz 1988) and p-stable (Osorio et al. 2006) semantics are important. To show this, we introduce a general schema SC1 which takes as input a logic program P and a set of atoms M , then considering a function R which maps P into another logic program, SC1 returns a subset of atoms of the signature of P 1. In order to infer ranges from the argumentation point of view using SC1, the logic program P has to capture an argumentation framework. Let us observe that there are different mappings from AFs into logic programs which have been used for characterizing Dung\u2019s argumentation semantics as logic programming inferences (Carballido et al. 2009; Dung 1995; Caminada et al. 2013; Strass 2013). In this sense, the following question arises:\n[Q2] Can the mappings used for characterizing Dung\u2019s argumentation semantics characterize range-based argumentation semantics using SC1?\nIn order to give an answer to Q2, we consider the mappings \u03a0AF and \u03a0 \u2212 AF which have been used for characterizing Dung\u2019s argumentation semantics in terms of logic programming semantics. \u03a0AF has been shown to be a flexible mapping to characterize the grounded, stable, preferred, complete and ideal semantics by using logic programming semantics such as, the well-founded, stable, p-stable, Clark\u2019s completion and well-founded+ semantics, respectively (Carballido et al. 2009; Nieves et al. 2008; Nieves and Osorio 2014). \u03a0\u2212AF has been used to characterize the grounded, stable, preferred, complete, semi-stable and CF2 (Dung 1995; Nieves et al. 2011; Strass 2013).\nConsidering \u03a0AF and \u03a0 \u2212 AF for defining two different instantiations of SC1, we will define the so-called GL-supported and GL-stage models. We will show that GL-supported and GL-stage models characterize the semi-stable and stage extensions, respectively. In these instantiations of SC1, we will instantiate the functionR with the well-known GelfondLifschitz reduction which is the core of the construction of the stable model semantics (Gelfond 2008). Moreover, we will point out that R can be instantiated with the RED reduction, which is the core of the p-stable semantics (Osorio et al. 2006), getting the same effect in the constructions of the GL-supported and GL-stage models.\nTo the best of our knowledge, SC1 is the first schema designed to capture the range concept from a logic programming point of view. It is worth mentioning that a range-based semantics as semi-stable semantics has been already characterized as logic programming inference (Caminada et al. 2013; Strass 2013); however, these characterizations do not offer a schema for capturing the concept of range from a logic programming point of view\n1 The formal definition of SC1 is presented in Section 3.1\nin order to characterize (or construct) other range-based argumentation semantics such as stage semantics.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, a basic background about logic programming and argumentation is introduced. In Section 3, by considering a couple of instantiations of SC1, we introduce the so-called GL-supported and GL-stage models; moreover, we show how these models characterize both semi-stable and stage extensions. In Section 4, a discussion of related work is presented. In the last section, our conclusions are presented."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "In this section, we introduce the syntax of normal logic programs and the p-stable and stable model semantics.

A literal is an atom a (called a positive literal), or the negation of an atom not a (called a negative literal). Given a set of atoms {a1, . . . , an}, we write not {a1, . . . , an} to denote the set of literals {not a1, . . . , not an}. A normal clause C is written as:\na0 \u2190 a1, . . . , aj , not aj+1, . . . , not an\nwhere ai is an atom, 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n. When n = 0 the normal clause is called a fact and is an abbreviation of a0 \u2190 \u22a4, where \u22a4 is the ever true atom. A normal logic program is a finite set of normal clauses. Sometimes, we denote a clause C by a \u2190 B+, not B\u2212, where B+ contains all the positive body literals and B\u2212 contains all the negative body literals. When B\u2212 = \u2205, the clause C is called a definite clause. A definite program is a finite set of definite clauses. LP denotes the set of atoms that occurs in P. Given a signature L, ProgL denotes the set of all the programs defined over L. Given a normal logic program P , Facts(P ) = {a|a \u2190 \u22a4 \u2208 P}.\nIn some cases we treat a logic program as a logical theory. In these cases, each negative literal not a is replaced by \u00aca where \u00ac is regarded as the classical negation in classical logic. Logical consequence in classical logic is denoted by \u22a2.

If M \u2286 LP , we write P M when: P \u22a2 M and M is a classical 2-valued model of the logical theory obtained from P (i.e. atoms in M are set to true, and atoms not in M to false). We say that a model M of a program P is minimal if a model M \u2032 of P different from M such that M \u2032 \u2282 M does not exist."}, {"heading": "2.2 Stable model and p-stable semantics", "text": "Stable model semantics is one of the most influential logic programming semantics in the non-monotonic reasoning community (Baral 2003) and is defined as follows:\nDefinition 1\n(Gelfond and Lifschitz 1988) Let P be a normal logic program. For any set S \u2286 LP , let PS be the definite logic program obtained from P by deleting\n(i) each clause that has a formula not l in its body with l \u2208 S, and then (ii) all formul\u00e6 of the form not l in the bodies of the remaining rules.\nThen, S is a stable model of P if S is a minimal model of PS . Stable(P ) denotes the set of stable models of P\nFrom hereon, whenever we say Gelfond-Lifschitz (GL) reduction, we mean the reduction PS . As we can observe GL reduction is the core of the stable model semantics.\nThere is an extension of the stable model semantics which is called p-stable semantics (Osorio et al. 2006). P-stable semantics was formulated in terms of Paraconsistent logics. Like stable model semantics, p-stable semantics is defined in terms of a single reduction, RED, which is defined as follows:\nDefinition 2\n(Osorio et al. 2006) Let P be a normal program and M be a set of atoms. We define RED(P,M) := {l \u2190 B+, not (B\u2212 \u2229M)|l \u2190 B+, not B\u2212 \u2208 P}.\nAs we can see, GL reduction and RED reduction have different behaviors. On the one hand, the output of GL reduction always is a definite program; on the other hand, the output of RED reduction can contain normal clauses.\nBy considering RED reduction, the p-stable semantics for normal logic programs is defined as follows:\nDefinition 3\n(Osorio et al. 2006) Let P be a normal program and M be a set of atoms. We say that M is a p-stable model of P if RED(P,M) M . P -stable(P ) denotes the set of p-stable models of P .\nThe stable model and p-stable semantics are two particular 2-valued semantics for normal program. In general terms, a logic programming semantics SEM is a function from the class of all programs into the powerset of the set of (2-valued) models.\nBefore moving on, let us introduce the following notation. Let P be a logic program, 2SEM(P ) denotes the 2-valued models of P . Given two logic programming semantics SEM1 and SEM2, SEM1 is stronger than SEM2 if for every logic program P , SEM1(P ) \u2286 SEM2(P ). Let us observe that the relation stronger than between logic programming semantics is basically defining an order between logic programming semantics."}, {"heading": "2.3 Argumentation theory", "text": "In this section, we introduce the definition of some argumentation semantics. To this end, we start by defining the basic structure of an argumentation framework (AF).\nDefinition 4 (Dung 1995) An argumentation framework is a pair AF := \u3008AR, attacks\u3009, where AR is a finite set of arguments, and attacks is a binary relation on AR, i.e. attacks \u2286 AR \u00d7AR.\nWe say that a attacks b (or b is attacked by a) if (a, b) \u2208 attacks holds. Similarly, we say that a set S of arguments attacks b (or b is attacked by S) if b is attacked by an argument in S. We say that c defends a if (b, a) and (c, b) belongs to attacks.\nLet us observe that an AF is a simple structure which captures the conflicts of a given set of arguments. In order to select coherent points of view from a set of conflicts of arguments, Dung introduced the so-called argumentation semantics. These argumentation semantics are based on the concept of an admissible set.\nDefinition 5 (Dung 1995)\n\u2022 A set S of arguments is said to be conflict-free if there are no arguments a, b in S such that a attacks b. \u2022 An argument a \u2208 AR is acceptable with respect to a set S of arguments if for each argument b \u2208 AR: If b attacks a then b is attacked by S. \u2022 A conflict-free set of arguments S is admissible if each argument in S is acceptable w.r.t. S.\nLet us introduce some notation. Let AF := \u3008AR, attacks\u3009 be an AF and S \u2286 AR. S+ = {b|a \u2208 S and (a, b) \u2208 attacks}.\nDefinition 6 (Caminada 2006; Dung 1995) Let AF := \u3008AR, attacks\u3009 be an argumentation framework. An admissible set of arguments S \u2286 AR is:\n\u2022 stable if S attacks each argument which does not belong to S. \u2022 preferred if S is a maximal (w.r.t. set inclusion) admissible set of AF . \u2022 complete if each argument, which is acceptable with respect to S, belongs to S. \u2022 semi-stable if S is a complete extension such that S \u222aS+ is maximal w.r.t. set inclu-\nsion.\nIn addition to argumentation semantics based on admissible sets, there are other approaches for defining argumentation semantics (Baroni et al. 2011). One of these approaches is the approach based on conflict-free sets (Verheij 1996). Considering conflict-free sets, Verheij introduced the so-called stage semantics:\nDefinition 7 Let AF := \u3008AR, attacks\u3009 be an argumentation framework. E is a stage extension if E is a conflict-free set and E \u222a E+ is maximal w.r.t. set inclusion.\nLet us observe that both semi-stable and stage semantics are based on the so-called range which is defined as follows: If E is a set of arguments, then E \u222a E+ is called its range. According to the literature, the notion of range was first introduced by Verheij (Verheij 1996)."}, {"heading": "2.4 Mappings from argumentation frameworks to normal programs", "text": "In this section, two mappings from an AF into a logic program will be presented. These mappings are based on the ideas of conflictfreeness and reinstatement which are the basic concepts behind the definitions of conflict-free sets and admissible sets. In these mappings, the predicate def(x) is used, with the intended meaning of def(x) being \u201cx is a defeated argument\u201d.\nA pair of mapping functions w.r.t. an argument is defined as follows.\nDefinition 8\nLet AF := \u3008AR, attacks\u3009 be an argumentation framework and a \u2208 AR. We define a pair of mappings functions:\n\u03a0\u2212(a) = \u22c3\nb:(b,a)\u2208attacks\n{def(a) \u2190 not def(b)}\n\u03a0+(a) = \u22c3\nb:(b,a)\u2208attacks\n{def(a) \u2190 \u2227\nc:(c,b)\u2208attacks\ndef(c)}\nLet us observe that \u03a0\u2212(a) suggests that an argument a is defeated when anyone of the arguments which attack a is not defeated. In other words, an argument that has an attacker that is not defeated has to be defeated; hence, \u03a0\u2212(a) stands for conflictfreeness. \u03a0+(a) suggests that an argument a is defeated when all the arguments that defends a are defeated. In other word, any argument that is not defeated has to be defended; therefore\u03a0+(a) stands for admissibility.\nOne can see that if a given argument a has no attacks, then \u03a0\u2212(a) = {} and \u03a0+(a) = {}. This situation happens because an argument that has no attacks is an acceptable argument which means that it belongs to all extensions sets of an AF .\nBy considering \u03a0\u2212(a) and \u03a0+(a), two mappings from an AF into a logic program are introduced.\nDefinition 9\nLet AF := \u3008AR, attacks\u3009 be an argumentation framework. We define their associated normal programs as follows:\n\u03a0\u2212AF := \u22c3\na\u2208AR\n{\u03a0\u2212(a)}\n\u03a0AF := \u03a0 \u2212 AF \u222a \u22c3\na\u2208AR\n{\u03a0+(a)}\nObserving Definition 9, it is obvious that \u03a0\u2212AF is a subset of \u03a0AF . However, each mapping is capturing different concepts: \u03a0\u2212AF is a declarative specification of the idea of conflictfreeness and \u03a0AF is a declarative specification of both ideas: conflictfreeness and reinstatement. Indeed, one can see that the 2-valued logical models of \u03a0\u2212AF characterize the conflict-free sets of an AF and the 2-valued logical models of \u03a0AF characterize the admissible sets of an AF ."}, {"heading": "3 Semi-stable and Stage extensions as 2-valued models", "text": "This section introduces the main results of this paper.

To this end, let us start defining the concept of a supported model.\nDefinition 10 (Supported model) Let P be a logic program and M be a 2-valued model of P . M is a supported model of P if for each a \u2208 M , there is a0 \u2190 B+, not B\u2212 \u2208 P such that a = a0, B+ \u2286 M and B\u2212 \u2229M = \u2205.\nAs we saw in Definition 6, semi-stable extensions are defined in terms of complete extensions. It has been shown that the supported models of \u03a0AF characterize the complete extensions of a given AF (Osorio et al. 2013). By having in mind this result, we introduce an instantiation of the schema SC1 in order to define the concept of GL-supported-model.\nDefinition 11 (GL-supported-model) Let AF = \u3008AR,Attacks\u3009 be an argumentation framework and M be a supported model of \u03a0AF . M is a GL-supported-model of \u03a0AF if Facts((\u03a0AF )M )\u222a{L\u03a0AF \\M} is maximal w.r.t. set inclusion. GLModels(\u03a0AF ) denotes the GL-supported models of \u03a0AF .\nIn other words, a supported model M of \u03a0AF is a GL-supported-model if for every supported model N of \u03a0AF such that N is different of M , SC(\u03a0AF ,M) 6\u2282 SC(\u03a0AF , N) where SC(\u03a0AF , X) = Facts((\u03a0AF )X) \u222a {L\u03a0AF \\X}.\nLet us observe that the function R of the schema SC1 was replaced by the GL-reduction in the construction of a GL-supported model. One of the main constructions of the definition of a GL-supported model is Facts((\u03a0AF )M ). This part of the construction of a GL-supported model is basically characterizing the set E+ where E is a complete extension. We can see that the GL reduction is quite important for this construction. As we saw in Definition 1, GL reduction is the core of the definition of stable models.\nWe want to point out that the definition of GL-supported models can also be based on the RED reduction which is the reduction used for defining p-stable models (see Definition 3). This similarity between RED and GL reductions argues that both RED and GL reductions\ncan play an important role for capturing the idea of range of an argumentation framework from a logic programming point of view. As we will see in the following theorem, GLsupported models characterize semi-stable extensions; hence, both RED and GL reductions play an important role for capturing semi-stable extension as 2-valued logical models.\nIn order to simplify the presentation of some results, let us introduce the following notation. Let EM = {x|def(x) \u2208 L\u03a0AF \\M} and E + M = {x|def(x) \u2208 Facts((\u03a0AF ) M )} where M \u2286 L\u03a0AF . As we can see, EM and E + M are basically sets of arguments which are induced by a set of atoms M .\nTheorem 1\nLet AF = \u3008AR, attacks\u3009 be an argumentation framework and M \u2286 L\u03a0AF . M is a GLsupported model of \u03a0AF iff EM is a semi-stable extension of AF .\nProof\nLet us start introducing the following result from (Osorio et al. 2013):\nR1: Let AF = \u3008AR, attacks\u3009 be an argumentation framework. M is a supported model of \u03a0AF iff EM is a complete extension of \u03a0AF .\nThe proof goes as follows:\n=> Let M be a GL-supported model of \u03a0AF and M\u2217 = Facts((\u03a0AF )M ). Then by definition of a GL-supported model, M\u2217 \u222a L\u03a0AF \\ M is maximal w.r.t. set inclusion. Moreover, M is a supported model. Therefore, by R1, EM is a complete extension. Hence, it is not hard to see that EM \u222a E + M is a range with respect to the complete\nextension EM . Since M\u2217 \u222aL\u03a0AF \\M is maximal w.r.t. set inclusion, EM \u222aE + M is also maximal w.r.t. set inclusion. Hence, EM is a semi-stable extension. <= Let us suppose that E is a semi-stable extension of AF . By definition E \u222aE+ is maximal w.r.t. set inclusion and E is a complete extension. By R1, there exists a supported modelM of \u03a0AF such that EM = E; moreover, any supported modelN of \u03a0AF has the property that EN\u222aE + N is maximal w.r.t. set inclusion. ThenL\u03a0AF \\N\u222aFacts((\u03a0AF ) N )\nis maximal w.r.t. set inclusion. Then N is a GL-supported model of \u03a0AF .\nAn interesting property of GL-supported models is that they can be characterized by both the set of p-stable models of \u03a0AF and the set of 2-valued models of \u03a0AF .\nProposition 1\nLet AF = \u3008AR, attacks\u3009 be an argumentation framework.\n1. M is a GL-supported model of \u03a0AF iff EM \u222a E + M is maximal w.r.t. set inclusion\nwhere M is a 2-valued model of \u03a0AF .\n2. M is a GL-supported model of \u03a0AF iff EM \u222a E + M is maximal w.r.t. set inclusion\nwhere M is a p-stable model \u03a0AF .\nProof\nWe start introducing the following observations from the state of the art:\n1. Let M \u2286 L\u03a0AF . M is a 2-valued model of \u03a0AF iff EM is an admissible extension of AF (Nieves and Osorio 2014).\n2. According to Proposition 4 by (Caminada et al. 2012) the following statements are equivalent:\n(a) E is a complete extension such that E \u222a E+ is maximal (w.r.t. set inclusion). (b) E is an admissible set such that E \u222a E+ is maximal (w.r.t. set inclusion).\n3. Let M \u2286 L\u03a0AF . M is a p-stable model of \u03a0AF iff EM is a preferred extension of AF (Carballido et al. 2009).\nNow let us prove each of the points of the proposition:\n1. M is a GL-supported model of \u03a0AF iff Facts((\u03a0AF )M ) \u222a {L\u03a0AF \\ M} is maximal w.r.t. set inclusion and M is a supported model. By Theorem 1, EM \u222a E + M is maximal\nw.r.t. set inclusion and M is a supported model iff EM \u222a E + M is maximal and EM is a complete extension of AF . By Observation 2, EM \u222aE + M is maximal and EM is a complete extension of AF iff EM \u222a E + M is maximal and EM is an admissible extension of AF . Hence, the result follows by Observation 1 which argues that any 2-valued model of \u03a0AF characterizes an admissible set of AF .\n2. Let us start by observing that semi-stable extensions can be characterized by preferred extensions with maximal range which means: E is a semi-stable extension iff E \u222a E+\nis maximal (w.r.t. set inclusion) and E is a preferred extension (see Proposition 13 from (Baroni et al. 2011)). Hence, the result follows by Observation 3 and Theorem 1.\nA direct consequence of Proposition 1 and Theorem 1 is the following corollary which introduces a pair of characterizations of semi-stable extensions as 2-valued models and p-stable models of \u03a0AF .\nCorollary 1\nLet AF = \u3008AR, attacks\u3009 be an argumentation framework.\n1. Let M be a p-stable model of \u03a0AF . EM is a semi-stable extension of AF iff EM \u222a E+M is maximal w.r.t. set inclusion. 2. Let M be a 2-valued model of \u03a0AF . EM is a semi-stable extension of AF iff EM \u222a E+M is maximal w.r.t. set inclusion.\nObserving Corollary 1, we can see that there is an interval of logic programming semantics which characterizes semi-stable extensions. This interval of logic programming semantics is defined by the order-relation between logic programming semantics: stronger than. This result is formalized by the following corollary.\nCorollary 2 Let AF = \u3008AR, attacks\u3009 be an argumentation framework and SEM be a logic programming semantics such that SEM is stronger than 2SEM and P -stable is stronger than SEM . If M \u2208 SEM(\u03a0AF ), then EM is a semi-stable extension of AF iff EM \u222a E + M is maximal w.r.t. set inclusion.\nGiven the relation of semi-stable extensions with the stable and preferred extensions, we can observe some relations between GL-supported models w.r.t. the stable model semantics (Gelfond and Lifschitz 1988) and p-stable semantics.\nProposition 2 Let AF = \u3008AR, attacks\u3009 be an argumentation framework.\n1. If M is a stable model of \u03a0AF then M is a GL-supported model of \u03a0AF . 2. If M is a GL-supported model of \u03a0AF then M is a p-stable model of \u03a0AF .\nProof 1. It follows from Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 by (Caminada et al. 2012). 2. It follows from Theorem 1 and Theorem 3 by (Caminada et al. 2012).\nProposition 3 Let AF = \u3008AR, attacks\u3009 be an argumentation framework such that Stable(\u03a0AF ) 6= \u2205. Then, Stable(\u03a0AF ) = GLModels(\u03a0AF ).\nProof We know that E is a stable extension of AF iff E = EM where M is a stable model of \u03a0AF (Theorem 5 by (Carballido et al. 2009)). Hence, the result follows from Theorem 1 and Theorem 5 by (Caminada et al. 2012)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Stage Semantics", "text": "We have seen that the idea of range w.r.t. complete extensions can be captured by instantiating the schema SC1 considering supported-models, the GL-reduction and \u03a0AF .\nIn Section 2.4, the mappings \u03a0\u2212AF and \u03a0AF were introduced. We have observed that \u03a0\u2212AF is basically a declarative specification of conflict-free sets. Given that stage semantics is based on conflict-free sets, we will consider \u03a0\u2212AF for instantiating SC1 and defining the so-called GL-stage models:\nDefinition 12 Let AF = \u3008AR, attacks\u3009 be an argumentation framework and M be a 2-valued model of \u03a0\u2212AF .

In order to formalize this result, the following notation is introduced: Let E\u2032M = {x|def(x) \u2208 L\u03a0\u2212\nAF\n\\M}\nand E \u2032+ M = {x|def(x) \u2208 Facts((\u03a0 \u2212 AF ) M )} where M \u2286 L\u03a0\u2212\nAF\n.

M is a GL-stage model of \u03a0\u2212AF iff E \u2032 M is a stage extension of AF .\nProof Let us start with one observation:\nO1: Let AF = \u3008AR, attacks\u3009 be an argumentation framework. E\u2032M is a conflict-free set of AF iff M is a 2-valued model of \u03a0\u2212AF .\n=> Let M be a GL-stage model of \u03a0\u2212AF and M \u2217 = Facts((\u03a0\u2212AF ) M ). Then by definition of a GL-stage model, M\u2217 \u222a L\u03a0\u2212\nAF\n\\ M is maximal w.r.t. set inclusion and M is a 2-\nvalued model. Hence, by O1, E\u2032M is a conflict-free set. One can see that E \u2032 M \u222a E \u2032+ M is a range with respect to the conflict-free set E\u2032M . Since M \u2217 \u222a L\u03a0\u2212\nAF\n\\M is maximal\nw.r.t. set inclusion, E\u2032M \u222aE \u2032+ M is also maximal w.r.t. set inclusion. Hence, EM is a stage\nextension. <= Let us suppose that E is a stage extension of AF . By definition E \u222a E+ is maximal\nw.r.t. set inclusion and E is a conflict-free set. By O1, there exists a 2-valued model M of \u03a0\u2212AF such that E \u2032 M = E; moreover, any 2-valued model N of \u03a0 \u2212 AF has the property that E\u2032N \u222a E \u2032+ N is maximal w.r.t. set inclusion. Then L\u03a0\u2212\nAF\n\\ N \u222a Facts((\u03a0\u2212AF ) N ) is\nmaximal w.r.t. set inclusion. Then N is a GL-stage model of \u03a0\u2212AF .\nLet us observe that Facts((\u03a0\u2212AF ) M ) \u222a {L\u03a0\u2212\nAF \\M}, which is the key construction of GL-stable models, is basically characterizing ranges w.r.t. conflict-free sets.\nDvor\u00e1k and Woltran have shown that the decision problems of the credulous and sceptical inferences are of complexity \u03a3P2 -hard and \u03a0 p 2-hard, respectively, for both semi-stable and stage semantics (Dvor\u00e1k and Woltran 2010). Hence it is straightforward to observe that the decision problems of the credulous and sceptical inferences are of complexity \u03a3P2 -hard and \u03a0p2-hard, respectively, for both GL-supported models and GL-stage models. Let us remember that GL-supported models and GL-stage models are defined under the resulting class of programs of the mappings \u03a0AF and \u03a0 \u2212 AF , respectively."}, {"heading": "4 Related work", "text": "Dung showed that argumentation can be viewed as logic programming with negation as failure and vice versa. This strong relationship between argumentation and logic programming has given way to intensive research in order to explore the relationship between argumentation and logic programming (Caminada et al. 2013; Carballido et al. 2009; Dung 1995;\nNieves et al. 2005; Nieves et al. 2008; Osorio et al. 2013; Nieves et al. 2011; Strass 2013; Wu et al. 2009). A basic requirement for exploring the relationship between argumentation and logic programming is to identify proper mappings which allow us to transform an argumentation framework into a logic program and vice versa. The flexibility of these mappings will frame the understanding of argumentation as logic programming (and vice versa). Therefore, defining simple and flexible mappings which regard argumentation as logic programming (and vice versa) will impact the use of logic programming in argumentation (and vice versa). Currently, we can find different mappings for regarding argumentation as logic programming (and vice versa) (Caminada et al. 2013; Carballido et al. 2009; Dung 1995; Gabbay and d\u2019Avila Garcez 2009). All of them offer different interpretations of argumentation as logic programming (and vice versa). Depending on these interpretations, one can identify direct relationships between argumentation inferences and logic programming inferences.\nIn this paper, we have limited our attention to the interpretation of argumentation as logic programming. In this sense, there are some characterizations of semi-stable inference as logic programming inference (Caminada et al. 2013; Strass 2013). Caminada et al., (Caminada et al. 2013), showed that the semi-stable semantics can be characterized by the L-stable semantics and the mapping PAF which is defined as follows: Given an argumentation framework AF := \u3008AR, attacks\u3009:\nPAF = \u22c3\nx\u2208AR\n{x \u2190 \u2227\n(y,x)\u2208attacks\nnot y}\nUnlike GL-supported models which are 2-valued models, the models of the L-stable semantics are 3-valued. Moreover, unlike \u03a0AF which is a declarative specification of admissible sets, PAF is a declarative specification of conflict-free sets.\nStrass (Strass 2013) has also showed that the semi-stable semantics can by characterized by both the so-called L-supported models and L-Stable models. Unlike Caminada\u2019s characterization and our characterizations, Strass considered the mapping \u03a0\u2212AF . As we have observed in Section 2.4, the clauses of \u03a0\u2212AF are a subset of \u03a0AF which is the mapping that we considered in both Theorem 1 and Corollary 2. It is worth mentioning that the mapping introduced by Dung (Dung 1995) can be transformed into \u03a0\u2212AF .\nWe cannot argue that one characterization is better than the other; however, we can observe that all these characterizations, including the ones introduced in this paper, offer different interpretations of semi-stable inference. Moreover, given that semi-stable inference has been characterized in terms of both L-stable semantics and L-supported modes, it seems that these logic programming semantics are related to GL-supported semantics.\nIn the literature, there are different characterizations of argumentation semantics in terms of logic programming semantics. A summary of these characterization is presented in Table 1.\nTable 1 argues for a strong relationship between argumentation inference and logic programming inference. Moreover, we can observe that the argumentation semantics which have been characterized by logic programming semantics have been studied from different points of view, e.g., Labellings (Baroni et al. 2011). This evidence argues that any welldefined argumentation semantics must be characterized by a logic programming seman-\ntics. However, further research is required in order to identify the necessary conditions which could support a basic definition of a Well-defined Non-monotonic Inference of any argumentation semantics. These conditions can be identified in terms of non-monotonic reasoning properties which have been explored in both fields argumentation and logic programming, e.g., the property of relevance (Caminada 2006; Nieves et al. 2011).\nThe exploration of argumentation as logic programming inference is not limited to the characterization of argumentation semantics in terms logic programming semantics. Since Dung\u2019s presented his seminal paper (Dung 1995), he showed that logic programming can support the construction of argumentation-based systems. Currently there are quite different logic-based argumentation engines which support the inference of argumentation semantics (Charwat et al. 2015; Egly et al. 2010; Toni and Sergot 2011). It is well-known that the computational complexity of the decision problems of argumentation semantics ranges from NP-complete to \u03a0(p)2 -complete. In this setting, Answer Set Programming has consolidated as a strong approach for building argumentation-based systems (Charwat et al. 2015; Egly et al. 2010; Toni and Sergot 2011; Nieves et al. 2005)."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions", "text": "Currently, most of the well accepted argumentation semantics have been characterized as logic programming inference (Table 1). This evidence argues that whenever a new semantics appears, it is totally reasonable to search for a characterization of it as a logic programming inference.\nAccording to Theorem 1, semi-stable semantics can share the same mapping (i.e. \u03a0AF ) with grounded, stable, preferred, complete and ideal semantics for being characterized as logic programming inference. This result argues that all these argumentation semantics can share the same interpretation of an argumentation framework as a logic program. Certainly, the logic programming semantics which are considered for characterizing these argumentation semantics share also a common interpretation of the argumentation inference which is restricted to the class of programs defined by \u03a0AF . We have also showed that stage semantics can be also characterized by a logic programming semantics (Theorem 2). This result argues that stage semantics has also logic programming foundations. Considering Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, we can give a positive answer to Q2.\nAn interesting observation, from the results of this paper, is that the concept of range which is fundamental for defining semi-stable and stage semantics can be captured from the logic programming point of view by considering SC1 which can be based on wellacceptable reductions from logic programming. It is worth mentioning that reductions as GL and RED suggest some general rules for managing negation as failure. This evidence suggests that SC1 defines an approach for answering Q1.\nWe argue that SC1 suggests a generic approach for exploring the concept of range in two directions: to explore ranges as logic programming models and to explore new argumentation semantics based on both logic programming models and ranges."}], "references": [{"title": "Knowledge Representation, Reasoning and Declarative Problem Solving", "author": ["C.
