Typically, the focus is on new information that is given as a propositional formula. In this paper, we are concerned with situations where an agent needs to revise by a conditional where the antecedent is almost certainly false. More precisely, we consider antecedents that will not be believed given any finite amount of \u201cregular\u201d supporting evidence. We represent the degree of belief in such formulas using Ordinal Conditional Functions that may take infinite values, and we provide an approach to conditional revision based on basic ordinal arithmetic.\nThis paper makes several contributions to existing work on belief change.1 First, we demonstrate that a simple algebra of belief change in the finite case extends naturally to the infinite case, giving a form of belief improvement. In the process, we demonstrate that there are natural examples in commonsense reasoning where multiple levels of infinite implausibility are actually useful.

We assume an underlying propositional signature P. An interpretation over P is called a state, while a logically closed set of formulas over P is called a belief set. A belief revision operator is a function that combines the initial belief set and a formula to produce a new belief set.\nFormal approaches to belief revision typically require an agent to have some form of ordering or ranking that gives the relative plausibility of possible states. For example, in the well-known AGM approach, total pre-orders over states are used to represent the perceived likelihood of each state (AGM85; KM92). Unfortunately, this approach does not handle the problem of iterated belief revision. Related work has addressed iterated revision by explicitly specifying how the ordering changes, rather than just the belief set (DP97; BM06; JT07).\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n09 42\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n3 1\nM ar\n2 01\n6"}, {"heading": "Ordinal Conditional Functions", "text": "An ordinal conditional function (OCF) is a function that maps each state to an ordinal (Spo88; Wil94). In this approach, strength of belief is captured by ordinal precedence. Hence, if r is an OCF and r(s) < r(t), then s is a more plausible state than t. There is an obvious advantage to this approach in that a ranking function is clearly more expressive than a total pre-oder.\nWhile the orginal definition allows the range of an OCF to be the class of all ordinals, in existing work it is common to restrict the range to the natural numbers, possibly with an additional symbol\u221e representing impossibility. In this paper, we will actually use a slightly larger range; so we need to briefly review ordinal arithmetic.2 For our purposes, it is sufficient to note that ordinals are actually sets defined by an \u201corder type.\u201d The finite ordinals are the natural numbers. The order type of the natural number n is unique, because it is the only ordinal that has exactly n \u2212 1 preceding ordinals. The first infinite ordinal is \u03c9, the set of all natural numbers. Every countably infinite subset of the natural numbers is order-isomorphic to \u03c9.\nIt is easy to construct a countably infinite set that is not order isomorphic to \u03c9: just add another symbol \u221e at the end that is larger than every natural number. The ordinal that defines the order type of this set is written \u03c9 + 1. Similarly, there exists a distinct ordinal \u03c9 + n for any natural number n. And if we add a complete copy of the natural numbers, then we have the ordinal \u03c9+\u03c9 which is normally written as \u03c9 \u00b7 2. We can procede in this manner indefinitely to define a countably infinite sequence of ordinals. By taking powers, we can get even more order types; we will not delve further into this topic.\nOrdinal addition can be understood in terms of the informal discussion above. Given ordinals \u03b1 and \u03b2, the ordinal \u03b1+ \u03b2 has the order type obtained by taking a set with order type \u03b1 and then appending a set with order type \u03b2 where all the elements of \u03b2 follow the elements of \u03b1 in the underlying ordering. For finite ordinals, this coincides with the usual notion of addition. For infinite valued ordinals it does not. Note for example that 1 +\u03c9 = \u03c9; adding a number that precedes 0 does not change the order type, because the resulting structure is isomorphic to the natural numbers. On the other hand \u03c9 + 1 6= \u03c9. So ordinal addition is not commutative. It is also worth noting that ordinal subtraction is, in general, not well defined. In particular, it is not possible to define subtraction by \u03c9."}, {"heading": "Belief Change as Ordinal Arithmetic", "text": "Although our goal is to address revision by conditionals, we first introduce a simple approach to belief change based on the addition of ordinals.

In the discussion here, we skip over fundamental set theory, and the fact that ordertypes are defined in terms of set-containment. We refer the reader to (Dev93) for an excellent introduction.\nimportant for the class of conditionals that we wish to consider."}, {"heading": "Restricted Domains", "text": "The following definition allows us to define conditional functions over any set of ordinals.\nDefinition 1 Let S be a non-empty set of states and let \u0393 be a collection of ordinals. A \u0393-CF ( \u0393 conditional function) over S is a function r : S \u2192 \u0393 such that r(s) = 0 for some state s.\nNote that the definition of \u0393-CFs does not actually specify that \u0393 is a set, because we do not wish to specify the underlying set theory in detail.\nSeveral special cases are immediate:\n\u2022 Spohn\u2019s ordinal conditional functions are \u2126-CFs, where \u2126 is the collection of all ordinals.\n\u2022 The class of \u03c9-CFs coincides with the finite valued ranking functions common in the literature.\n\u2022 The class of (\u03c9 + 1)-CFs is the set of ranking functions that can take finite values, as well as the single \u201cimpossible\u201d plausiblity value\u221e. This is essentially equivalent to the possibilistic logic framework of (DP04), that uses the \u201cnecessity measure\u201d of 0.\nIn this paper, we are primarily interested in the class of \u03c92CFs. Note that \u03c92 can be specified as follows:\n\u03c92 = \u22c3 {\u03c9 \u00b7 k + c | k, c \u2208 \u03c9}.\nHence, every element of \u03c92 can be written as \u03c9 \u00b7 k + c for some k and c. We think of these conditional functions as having countably many infinite levels of implausibility. A picture of \u03c92 is shown in Figure 1.\nIf r is a \u0393-CF, we write\nBel(r) = {x | r(x) = 0}.\nThe degree of strength of a conditional function r is the least n such that n = r(v) for some v 6\u2208 Bel(r). Hence, the degree of strength is a measure of how difficult it would be for an agent to abandon the currently believed set of states."}, {"heading": "Finite Arithmetic on Conditional Functions", "text": "In the finite case, belief change can be captured through addition on ranking functions. Some variant of the following definition has appeared previously in published work by several authors; it is restated here and translated to our terminology.\nDefinition 2 Let r1 and r2 be \u03c9-CFs over S, and let m be the minimum value of r1 + r2. Then r1+\u0304r2 is the function on S defined as follows:\nr1+\u0304r2(x) = r1(x) + r2(x)\u2212m.\nIt is easy to check that this operation is associative, commutative, and that every element is invertible in the sense that, for each r there is an r\u2032 such that r+\u0304r\u2032 = 0. Therefore, in terms of algebra, we say that the class of \u03c9-CFs is an abelian group under +\u0304.\nNote that Spohn\u2019s conditionalization can be seen as a special case of this algebra on ranking functions. Let r1 be a finite plausibility function representing the initial beliefs of an agent. Let \u03c6 be a formula, let d be a positive integer, and let r2 be the ranking function defined as follows:\nr2(s) = { 0 if s |= \u03c6 d otherwise\nThen r1+\u0304r2 is equivalent to Spohn\u2019s conditionalization of r1 by \u03c6 with strength d. Similarly, if r2 takes only two values and the degree of strength of r2 is strictly larger than the degree of strength of r1, then r1+\u0304r2 is AGM revision.\nThis approach does not extend to larger classes of ordinals.\nProposition 1 Let \u03b2 be an ordinal such that \u03c9 \u2208 \u03b2. Then +\u0304 is not well-defined over the class of \u03b2-CFs.\nThe problem is that subtraction is not defined for all pairs of (infinite) ordinals.\nExample Consider the motivating example. We can define the following (\u03c9 + 1)\u2212 CFs:\nr1(s) = { 0 if s |= {fly} \u03c9 otherwise\nr2(s) = { \u03c9 if s |= {fly} 0 otherwise.\nNormalized addition of r1 and r2 requires us to calculate \u03c9\u2212 \u03c9. But this subtraction is not defined, so the calculation can not be completed.\nThis problem could be avoided by removing the normalization, but the result would no longer be an OCF. If we want to work with ranking functions that are closed under some form of addition, then we must either modify the definition, or we must relax the constraint that the pre-image of 0 is non-empty. We opt for the former."}, {"heading": "Finite Zeroing", "text": "We define an algebra over \u03c92-CFs based on finite zeroing. The following relation will be useful in proving results. In the definition, and in some future results, it is useful to consider functions over ordinals that do not necessarily take the value 0 for any argument. We use the general term \u0393 ranking to refer to an arbitrary function from S to \u0393.3\n3Konieczny refers to this kind of OCF as a free OCF.(Kon09)\nDefinition 3 For \u0393 rankings r1 and r2, we write r1 \u223c r2 just in case the following condition holds for every pair of states s, t\nr1(s) < r1(t) \u21d0\u21d2 r2(s) < r2(t).\nClearly, \u223c is an equivalence relation. The intuition behind finite zeroing is that each conditional function can be categorized by its minimum value, in a manner that is useful for revision. Given any \u03c92 ranking r, let min(r) denote the minimum value r(s). Note that a minimum is guaranteed by the fact that the ordinals are wellordered.\nDefinition 4 Let r be an \u03c92 ranking with min(r) = \u03c9 \u00b7k+c. Then k is the degree of r and c is the finite shift, written deg(r) and fin(r) respectively.\nWe can use the degree and the finite shift to define the following operation.\nDefinition 5 Let r be an \u03c92 ranking with deg(r) = k and fin(r) = c. Define r\u0304 as follows. Let s be a state with r(s) = \u03c9 \u00b7m+ p.\n1. If m > k, then r\u0304(s) = \u03c9 \u00b7 (m\u2212 k) + c. 2. If m = k, then r\u0304(s) = (p\u2212 c). We call r\u0304 the finite zeroing of r. Intuitively, elements at the \u201clowest level\u201d are normalized to zero and elements at higher levels are shifted down by the degree of r. The following result is easy to prove.\nProposition 2 If r is an \u03c92 ranking, then r\u0304 is a \u03c92-CF and r \u223c r\u0304. Hence, the finite zeroing of any ranking is an equivalent \u03c92CF. We can now extend the definition of \u2217 to \u03c92-CFs. Definition 6 Let r1, r2 be \u03c92-CFs. Then\nr1 \u2217 r2 = r1 + r2.\nUsing this definition, \u2217 is consistent with +\u0304 for \u03c9-CFs. Hence, \u2217 can capture standard belief revision operators (e.g., AGM, DP) by restricting to finite values and setting the degree of strength of each function appropriately. This is the natural extension of revision, therefore, to the case that allows infinite plausibility values.\nExample The motivating example over {heavy, fly} can be captured by the following function:\nr(s) = { \u03c9 if s |= fly 10 if s |= heavy \u2227 \u00acfly 0 otherwise\nWe let \u2217n to denote a finite iteration of the \u2217 operator. Suppose that, for each V \u2208 {heavy, fly}, rV is an OCF such that rV (s) = 2 if and only if s 6|= V . The following are immediate:\n\u2022 r \u2217n rheavy(s) = 0 iff n \u2265 5. \u2022 r \u2217n rfly(s) 6= 0 for any n.\nHence, it takes 5 reports to convince the owner that their dog is overweight. No finite number of reports will convince them that the dog can fly.\nIn the \u03c92 case, the algebra obtained is not identical to the finite case.\nProposition 3 The class of \u03c92-CFs is a non-abelian group under \u2217. (i.e. it is closed, associative, and every element has an inverse, but it is not commutative).\nThe fact that \u2217 is not commutative has interesting consequences, as illustrated in the following example.\nExample Assume again that the vocabulary contains the predicates {heavy, fly}. Define\nr1(s) = { \u03c9 if s |= fly 0 otherwise\nr2(s) = { 0 if s |= \u00acheavy \u2227 fly 1 if s |= heavy \u2227 fly 2 otherwise.\nHence, r1 says that an agent believes dogs can not fly; moreover the agent essentially believes that a flying dog is an impossibility. On the other hand, r2 says that an agent believes that light dogs can fly - although the the strength of belief in this claim is only finite. Moreover, r2 gives an ordering over less plausible states as well. Note that both r1 and r2 can be either an initial belief state or an observation. The following calculations are immediate.\nr1 \u2217 r2(s) = { \u03c9 if s |= \u00acheavy \u2227 fly \u03c9 + 1 if s |= heavy \u2227 fly 0 otherwise.\nr2 \u2217 r1(s) = { \u03c9 if s = {fly} 0 otherwise.\nWhat is the significance of this example? It shows that conditional beliefs from an observation can be maintained at higher plausibility levels. In both cases, the underlying agent will not believe dogs can fly following revision. But the first revision allows the ordering of states to be refined somewhat at the conditional level. The second revision, on the other hand, washes away the finite level distinctions in the original belief set. This is similar to AGM revision in the sense that recent information seems to carry some particular weight. However, the infinite jumps in plausibility outweigh the preference for recency."}, {"heading": "Nearly Counterfactual Reasoning", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Motivation", "text": "In this section, we demonstrate how infinite-valued ordinal conditional functions can be useful for reasoning about conditional statements.\nExample We return to the flying-dog example. Suppose that we initially believe \u00acfly and \u00achollow; in other words,\nwe believe that dogs do not fly and that dogs do not have hollow bones. Now suppose we are told that flying dogs have hollow bones. Informaly, we want to revise by the conditional statement (hollow|fly).\nNote that (hollow|fly) actually does not give any new information about dogs. This revision should not change the relative ordering of any worlds with a finite strength of belief. However, it does result in a change of belief. If one is later convinced of the existence of flying dogs, then the fact about hollow bones should be incorporated.\nWe refer to the reasoning in the preceding example as nearly-counterfactual revision. It is essentially a form of counterfactual reasoning, in which hypothetical worlds are considered in isolation. At the same time, however, we keep a form of conditional memory at higher ordinal levels. This is not only useful for perspective altering revelations, but we argue it can also be useful for analogical reasoning.\nOne important feature that is typically taken as a requirement for conditional reasoning is the Ramsey Test. In the context of revision by conditional statements, Kern-Isberner formulates the Ramsey Test as follows: when revising by a conditional, one would like to ensure that revision by (\u03c8|\u03c6) followed by a revision by \u03c6 should guarantee belief in \u03c8 (Ker99). We suggest that this formulation needs to be refined in order to be used in the case where infinite ranks are possible.\nIn the case of the flying dog, one is quite likely to accept the conditional (hollow|fly) based on a single report with finite strength. However, a single report of fly with finite strength will not be believed. If the antecedent of the conditional is \u201cvery hard\u201d to believe, then we should not expect the Ramsey Test to hold without some additional condition on the strength of the subsequent report. The problem, in a sense, is that the notion of believing a conditional is quite different than the notion of believing a fact. In order to believe (hollow|fly), we simply need to keep some kind of record of this fact for the unlikely case where we discover that flying dogs happen to exist. On the other hand, in order to believe fly, we really need to make a significant change in our current world view."}, {"heading": "Levels of Implausibility", "text": "Approaches to counterfactual reasoning are typically inspired to some degree by Lewis, who indicates that the truth of a counterfactual sentence is determined by its truth in alternative worlds (Lew73). We can represent this idea with \u03c92-CFs. At each limit ordinal \u03c9 \u00b7 k, we essentially have an entirely new plausibility ordering. As k increases, each such ordering represents an increasingly implausible world. However, a sufficiently strong observation can force our beliefs to jump to any of these unlikely worlds. As such, these are not truly counterfactual worlds, because we admit the possibility that they may eventually be believed.\nThe important property that we can capture with \u03c92-CFs is the following: there are some formulas that may be true, yet we can not be convinced to believe them based on any finite number of pieces of \u201cweak evidence.\u201d This allows us\nto give the following formal definition of the term nearly counterfactual. Definition 7 Let r be an OCF. A formula \u03c6 is nearly counterfactual with respect to r just in case there is no \u03c9-CF r\u2032 such that Bel(r \u2217 r\u2032) |= \u03c6. The following is an immediate consequence of this definition. Proposition 4 If \u03c6 is nearly counterfactual with respect to r, then there is no finite sequence r1, . . . , rn of \u03c9-CFs such that Bel(r \u2217 r1 \u2217 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2217 rn) |= \u03c6. We introduce some useful notation. Definition 8 Let \u03c6 be a formula. An OCF r is a \u03c6strengthening iff Bel(r) = {s | s |= \u03c6}. So, a \u03c6-strengthening is just a ranking function where the minimal states are exactly the models of \u03c6. For any formula \u03c6, let (\u03c6, n) be the \u03c6-strengthening of \u03c6 where models of \u03c6 have plausibility 0 and every other state has plausibility n.\nDefinition 9 Let r be an \u03c92-CF. For any limit ordinal \u03c9 \u00b7 k, let rk be the following partial function:\nrk(s) = { r(s), if r(s) = \u03c9 \u00b7 k + c for some c undefined otherwise\nHence, rk is just the restriction of r to those states with plausibility values at level k. We say that \u03c6 is believed at level k if {s | s \u2208 min(rk)} |= \u03c6. Let poss(\u03c6) denote the set of natural numbers k such that s |= \u03c6 for some s in the domain of rk.\nWe can now introduce a form of strengthening with nearly counterfactual conditionals. In the definition, given an \u03c92CF r, we let deg(s) denote the value k such that r(s) = \u03c9 \u00b7 k + c. Definition 10 Let r be an \u03c92-CF and let \u03c8, \u03c6 be formulas where \u03c6 is nearly counterfactual with respect to r. Let n \u2208 \u03c9.\nr \u2217 (n, \u03c8|\u03c6)(s) = { r(s), if deg(s) 6\u2208 poss(\u03c6) r \u2217 (\u03c8, n)(s) otherwise\nWe call this function the n-stengthening of \u03c8 conditioned on \u03c6. This function finds all levels of r where \u03c6 is possible, and then strengthens \u03c8 at only those levels.\nExample Let r again be the plausibility function\nr(s) = { \u03c9 if s |= fly 10 if s |= heavy \u2227 \u00acfly 0 otherwise\nIt is easy to verify that fly is nearly counterfactual with respect to r. Now suppose that we extend the vocabulary to include the predicate symbol hollow. Define a new function r\u2032 as follows:\nr\u2032(s) = { r(s), if s 6|= hollow r(s) + 1, if s |= hollow\nThis just says that we initally believe our dog does not have hollow bones; however, it is not particularly implausible. It follows that:\n\u2022 r\u2032(s) = \u03c9 if s |= fly \u2227 \u00achollow. \u2022 r\u2032(s) = \u03c9 + 1 if s |= fly \u2227 hollow. From these results, it follows that: \u2022 r\u2032 \u2217 (2, hollow|fly)(s) = r\u2032(s), if s 6|= fly. \u2022 r\u2032 \u2217 (2, hollow|fly)(s) = \u03c9, if s |= fly \u2227 hollow. \u2022 r\u2032 \u2217 (2, hollow|fly)(s) = \u03c9 + 1, s |= fly \u2227 \u00achollow. So, roughly speaking, after strengthening by (hollow|fly), we now believe that hollow bones are more plausible in all hypothetical situations where we believe flying dogs are possible.\nNote that plausibility of a state is only changed at levels where \u03c6 is considered possible. Since the definition is only applied to nearly counterfactual conditions, this means that only hypothetical states are affected by the strengthening.\nIt remains to move from conditional strengthening to conditional revision. Recall that, for any \u03c92-CF with min(r) = \u03c9 \u00b7 k + c, we write fin(r) = c. Definition 11 Let r be an \u03c92-CF and let \u03c8, \u03c6 be formulas where \u03c6 is nearly counterfactual with respect to r.\nr \u2217 (\u03c8|\u03c6)(s) = { r(s), if deg(s) 6\u2208 poss(\u03c6) r \u2217 (\u03c8, fin(rk))(s) if r(s) = \u03c9 \u00b7 k + c\nHence, for revision, we strengthen belief in \u03c8 by the least value that will ensure \u03c8 is believed at level k.\nUnder this definition, we satisfy a modified form of the Ramsey Test. Proposition 5 Let r be an \u03c92-CF and let s be a state with r(s) = \u03c9 \u00b7 k + c. If r\u2032 is an \u03c92-CF with degree of strength larger than k and Bel(r\u2032) |= \u03c6, then\nBel((r \u2217 (\u03c8|\u03c6)) \u2217 r\u2032) |= \u03c8.\nHence, if we revise by (\u03c8|\u03c6) followed by an OCF with \u201csufficiently strong\u201d belief in \u03c6, then \u03c8 will be believed."}, {"heading": "Relation to Existing Work", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Infinite Plausibility Values", "text": "There has been related work on the use of infinite valued ordinals in OCFs. In particular, Konieczny defines the notion of a level of belief explicitly in terms of limit ordinals(Kon09). In this work, different \u201clevels\u201d are used to represent beliefs that are independent in a precise sense. The lowest level is used for representing an agents actual beliefs about the world, whereas higher levels are used to represent integrity constraints. Our approach here is different in that we explicitly use the ordering on limit ordinals to represent infinite leaps in plausibility. This work is also distinguished by the fact that we use ordinal arithmetic on a small class of ordinals to define a simple algebra of belief change.\nBelief Improvement The success postulate (K \u2217\u03c6 ` \u03c6) of the AGM framework is clearly incorrect in cases where evidence is additive. That is to say, there are situations where a single observation is not sufficient to convince an agent to believe a particular fact.\nImprovement operators (KP08) are belief change operators that address this issue by introducing a new set of postulates. The most important postulate states that an improvement operator \u25e6 must have the property that:\n(I1) There exists n \u2208 N such that B(\u03a8 \u25e6n \u03c6) ` \u03c6. Here \u03a8 is an epistemic state, and B(\u00b7) maps an epistemic state to the minimal elements of the underlying ordering. Hence, an improvement operator has the property that an agent will be convinced to believe \u03c6 after a finite number of improvements. The remaining postulates for a weak improvement operator are essentially the DP postulates applied to the operation \u25e6n obtained from (I1). We refer the reader to (KP08) for the complete list of postulates.\nWe define an analog of (I1) as follows. If r\u03c6 denotes a \u03c6-strengthening, we can express the condition as follows.\n(I\u2217) There exists n \u2208 N such that Bel(r \u2217n r\u03c6) |= \u03c6. The truth of this property depends on the degrees of strength of the functions.\nProposition 6 If r is an \u03c9-CF and r\u03c6 is a \u03c6-strengthening with finite strength, then I\u2217 holds.\nFor an epistemic state \u03a8 defined by\u227a\u03a8, let r\u03a8 be the canonical representation of \u03a8.4 Define \u25e6n such that \u03a8 \u25e6 \u03c6 is obtained by taking the ordering induced by r\u03a8 \u2217 r(\u03c6, n). Proposition 7 For any n \u2208 N, the operator \u25e6n is a weak improvement operator.\nWe call \u25e6n a finite improvement operator, because the degree of strength is finite. This result is essentially a corollary of Proposition 6, and it suggests that our \u2217 operation based on normalized addition is actually the natural extension of improvement to the setting of \u03c9-CFs.\nThe advantage of infinite plausibility values is that they give us greater flexibility in modelling improvement.\nProposition 8 If r is an \u03c92-CF and r\u03c6 is a \u03c6-strengthening with finite strength, then I\u2217 does not hold. This result essentially states that (I1) is not a sound property for \u2217 if we allow infinite plausibility values. This distinction can be seen in our running example. There is no finite number of improvements that will force the agent to believe that dogs can fly.\nIt is actually difficult to express the analog of Proposition 7 in the context of \u03c92-CFs, because a total pre-order over states can not capture the \u201cinfinite jumps\u201d in plausibility encoded by \u03c92 ordinal ranks. But it is possible to define a correspondence between sequences of orderings and ordinals in \u03c92.\nDefinition 12 Let r be an \u03c92-CF where max(r) = \u03c9 \u00b7 d+ b for some d, b. For i \u2264 d, let ri denote the function defined as follows:\n1. domain(ri) = {s | r(s) = \u03c9 \u00b7 i+ c}. 2. If r(s) = \u03c9 \u00b7 i+ c, then ri(s) = c. The following propositions are immediate.\n4If s is in the nth level of \u03a8 , then r\u03a8(s) = n\nProposition 9 Each ri is a \u03c9 ranking, and there exists an \u03c9-CF such that r\u2032i \u223c ri Proposition 10 For any \u03c92-CF r over a vocabulary P with deg(r) = d, there is an extended vocabulary P1 and a sequence r0, . . . , rd of \u03c9-CFs such that, for each i \u2264 d, the ri is equivalent (i.e. \u223c) to the restriction of r to ordinals of degree i.\nThis result is proved by just extending the vocabulary appropriately with propositional variables that make each infinite jump in the ordinal value definable. By breaking r into a set of \u03c9-CFs, it follows that (I\u2217) holds at level d when r\u03c6 has degree of strength \u03c9 \u00b7 d. Therefore, belief change by normalized addition on \u03c92-CFs can really just be seen as a finite collection of improvements as each level. The important point, however, is that no finite sequence of improvements at level d will ever impact the actual beliefs at lower levels."}, {"heading": "Conditional Belief Revision", "text": "Conditional belief revision was previously addressed by Kern-Isberner, who proposes a set of rationality postulates for conditional revision (Ker99). A concrete approach to conditional revision is also proposed, through the following \u03c9-CF :\nr \u2217 (\u03c8|\u03c6)(s) = { r(s)\u2212 r(\u03c8|\u03c6), if s |= \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 r(s) + \u03b1+ 1, if s |= \u03c6 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8 r(s), if s |= \u00ac\u03c6\nwhere \u03b1 = \u22121 if r({\u03c6, \u03c8}) < r({\u03c6}), and \u03b1 = 0 otherwise. This operation satisfies all of the postulates for conditional revision, as well as the Ramsey Test. We remark, however, that this approach is not well-defined if we allow infinite plausibility values because of the ordinal subtraction on the right hand side. We suggest that this is not just a formal artefact of the theory; conditionals that are \u201dalmost certainly\u201d false actually must be treated slightly differently.\nIn our approach, we essentially require the evidence for \u03c6 to be substantially stronger than the evidence for the conditional. We suggest that our beliefs following conditional revision should be changed in sort of an infinitesimally small way. While our beliefs about the actual world do not change, our beliefs about some (nearly) impossible world do, in fact, change.\nNote that it is actually possible to reconcile our approach with Kern-Isberner\u2019s approach, by using the conditional revision above on each level rk of the initial OCF r. At present, we are using a simple strengthening on each level, which actually flattens the plausibility structure after ordinal addition. A combined approach could respect the infinite jumps in plausibility, while satisfying the postulates for conditional revision at each level. We leave an investigation of this combined approach for future work."}, {"heading": "Discussion", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have explored the use of infinite ordinals for reasoning about belief change and conditional reasoning. We have shown that allowing plausibility values to range\nover \u03c92 results in a belief algebra that is only slightly more complicated, and we gain an expressive advantage. In particular, we can represent situations where stubbornly held beliefs are resistant to evidence to the contrary. We have demonstrated that this results in a slightly more expressive class of improvement operators where evidence increases relative belief, but no finite number of improvements will actually lead to a change in the belief state. Finally, we addressed so-called \u201cnearly counterfactual\u201d revision, where we incorporate information that is conditional on a highly unlikely statement."}, {"heading": "Future Work", "text": "This paper is a preliminary exploration into different applications and formal properties of infinite valued ordinal conditional functions. It remains to move beyond \u03c92-CFs, to completely characterize the relationship with improvement operators, and to consider further practical applications.\nIn the present framework, we have discussed nearly counterfactual reasoning as a tool for keeping a sort of \u201cmemory\u201d about unlikely situations, in order to incorporate this information later if necessary. But there is also a natural kind of reasoning that would allow us to use conditionals to reason by analogy about the actual state of the world. Consider the following well-known ambiguity from (Lew73), and originally attributed to Quine:\n1. If Caesar was president, he would use nuclear weapons.\n2. If Caesar was president, he would use catapults.\nAs a conditional, we could write both as (W |C), where W stands for a weapon that would be used and C is the condition \u201cCaesar is president.\u201d But (1) suggests that we condition by imagining Caesar alive in the current world. So this is a conditional statement interpreted in the current state of the world. On the other hand, (2) suggests that we consider what would happen in some past world where Caesar exists.\nNow suppose that we believe a certain politician is actually very similar to Caesar. If we believe that Caesar would use nuclear weapons, then we may conclude that this \u201creal\u201d politician would also use nuclear weapons. Formally, we could proceed as follows: if some hypothetical world is isomorphic to the current state of the world when we restrict the vocabulary (to not include Caesar), then we can use inferences about the hypothetical world to draw conclusions about the actual world. This is a form of ampliative reasoning that we intend to explore through \u03c92-CFs in future work."}], "references": [{"title": "On the logic of theory change: Partial meet functions for contraction and revision", "author": ["C.E.
