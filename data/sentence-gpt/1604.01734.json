In this problem, a set of indivisible objects or goods has to be allocated to a set of agents (individuals, entities...), taking into account, as best as possible, the agents\u2019 preferences about the objects. This classical collective decision making problem has plenty of practical applications, among which the allocation of space resources [23, 4], of tasks to workers in crowdsourcing market systems, papers to reviewers [19] or courses to students [13].\nThis problem can be tackled from two different perspectives. The first possibility is to resort to a benevolent entity in charge of collecting in a centralized way the preferences of all the agents about the objects. This entity then computes an allocation that takes into account these preferences and satisfies some fairness (e.g. envy-freeness) and efficiency (e.g. Pareto-optimality) criteria, or optimizes a well-chosen social welfare ordering. The second possibility is to have a distributed point of view, e.g. by starting from an initial allocation and letting the agents negotiate to swap their objects [27, 14].\nA somewhat intermediate approach consists in allocating the objects to the agents using a protocol, which can be seen as a way of building an allocation interactively by asking the agents a sequence of questions. Protocols are at the heart of works mainly concerning the allocation of divisible resources (cake-cutting) \u2014 see Brams and Taylor\u2019s seminal book [10] for a reference \u2014 but have also been studied in the context of indivisible goods [10, 8].\nIn this paper, we focus on a particular allocation protocol: sequences of sincere choices (also known as picking sequences). This very simple and natural protocol works as follows. A central authority chooses a sequence of agents before the protocol starts, having as many agents as the number of objects (some agents may appear several times in the sequence). Then, each agent appearing in the sequence is asked to choose in turn one object among those that remain. For instance, according to the sequence \u30081, 2, 2, 1\u3009, agent 1 is going to choose first, then agent 2 will pick two consecutive objects, and agent 1 will take the last object.\nThis simple protocol, actually used in a lot of everyday situations,1 has been studied for the first time by Kohler and Chandrasekaran [22]. Later, Brams and Taylor [11] have studied a particular version of this protocol, namely alternating sequences, in which the sequence of agents is restricted to a balanced (\u30081, 2, 2, 1...\u3009) or strict (\u30081, 2, 1, 2...\u3009) alternation of agents. Bouveret and Lang [6] have further formalized this protocol, whose properties (especially related to game theoretic aspects) have been characterized by Kalinowski et al. [20, 21]. Finally, Aziz et al. [2] have studied the complexity of problems related to finding whether a particular assignment (or bundle) is achievable by a particular class of picking sequences.\nOn top of all these works specifically dedicated to this protocol, we can add the interesting work by Brams et al. [9]. This work, which focuses on a situation where the agents have ordinal preferences, is not specifically dedicated to picking sequences. However, the authors make an interesting link between this protocol and Pareto-optimality, showing, among others, that picking sequences always result in a Pareto-optimal allocation, but also that every Pareto-optimal allocation can be obtained in this way.\nIn this paper, we will elaborate on these ideas and analyze the links between sequences and some efficiency and fairness properties, in a more general model in which the agents have numerical additive preferences on the objects, without any further restriction. Our main contributions are the following. We give a formalization of the link between allocation and sequences of sincere choices, highlighting a simple characterization of the sequenceability of an allocation. Then, we show that in this slightly more general framework than the one by Brams et al., surprisingly, Pareto-optimality and sequenceability are not equivalent anymore. As a consequence we can define a \u201cscale of efficiency\u201d that allows us to characterize the degree of efficiency of a given allocation. We also highlight an interesting link between sequenceability and another important economical concept: the competitive equilibrium from equal income (CEEI). Another contribution is the experimental exploration of the links between the scale of efficiency and fairness properties, which has led us to develop, among others, a practical method for testing if a given allocation passes the CEEI test \u2014 a practical problem which was still open [7].\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model of our allocation problem and the allocation protocol based on sequences of sincere choices. Section 3 focuses on the problem consisting in deciding whether an allocation can be obtained by a sequence of sincere choices. In the next two sections, we analyze the relation between sequences of sincere choices and three classical properties: Pareto-optimality (Section 4), envy-freeness and competitive equilibrium from equal income (Section 5). Finally, we explore experimentally in Section 6 the links between the \u201cscale of efficiency\u201d mentioned above, and the \u201cscale of fairness\u201d that we have described in a previous work [7]."}, {"heading": "2 Model and Definitions", "text": "The aim the fair division of indivisible goods, also called MultiAgent Resource Allocation (MARA), is to allocate a finite set of objects O = {1, . . . ,M} to a finite set of agents A = {1, . . . , N}. A sub-allocation on O\u2032 \u2286 O is a vector \u2212\u2192\u03c0 |O \u2032 = \u3008\u03c0 |O\u2032\n1 , . . . , \u03c0 |O\u2032 N \u3009, such that\ni 6= j \u21d2 \u03c0 |O\u2032 i \u2229 \u03c0 |O\u2032 j = \u2205 (a given object cannot be allocated to more than one agent) and \u222ai\u2208A\u03c0 |O\u2032 i = O \u2032 (all the objects from O\u2032 are allocated). \u03c0 |O\u2032 i \u2286 O \u2032 is called agent i\u2019s share on O\u2032. \u2212\u2192\u03c0 |O \u2032\u2032 is a sub-allocation of \u2212\u2192\u03c0 |O \u2032 when \u03c0 |O\u2032\u2032\ni \u2286 \u03c0 |O\u2032\ni for each agent i. Any sub-allocation\u2212\u2192\u03c0 |O on the entire set of objects will be denoted \u2212\u2192\u03c0 and just called allocation. Any satisfactory allocation must take into account the agents\u2019 preferences on the objects. Here, we will make the classical assumption that these preferences are numerically additive.\n1It is for instance used in the board game The Settlers of Catane for allocating initial resources.\nEach agent i has a utility function ui : 2 O \u2192 R+ measuring her satisfaction ui(\u03c0) when she obtains share \u03c0, which is defined as follows:\nui(\u03c0) def =\n\u2211\n\u2113\u2208\u03c0\nW (i, \u2113),\nwhere W (i, \u2113) is the weight given by agent i to object \u2113. This assumption, as restrictive as it may seem, is made by a lot of authors [24, 3, for instance] and is considered a good compromise between expressivity and conciseness.\nIf we put things together:\nDefinition 1. An instance of the additive multiagent resource allocation problem (addMARA instance for short) I = \u3008A,O,W \u3009 is a tuple (A,O,W ), where:\n\u2022 A = {1, . . . , i, . . . , N} is a set of N agents;\n\u2022 O = {1, . . . , \u2113, . . .M} is a set of M objects,\n\u2022 W : A\u00d7O \u2192 R+ is a mapping, W (i, \u2113) being the weight given by agent i to object \u2113.\nWe will denote by P(I) the set of allocations for I.\nWe will say that the agents\u2019 preferences are strict on the objects if, for each agent i and each pair of objects \u2113 6= m, we have W (i, \u2113) 6= W (i,m). Similarly, we will say that the agents\u2019 preferences are strict on the shares if, for each agent i and each pair of shares \u03c0 6= \u03c0\u2032, we have ui(\u03c0) 6= ui(\u03c0\u2032). Finally, we will say that the agents have same order preferences [7] if there is a permutation \u03b7 : O 7\u2192 O such that for each agent i and each pair of objects \u2113 and m, if \u03b7(\u2113) < \u03b7(m) then W (i, \u03b7(\u2113)) \u2265 W (i, \u03b7(m)).\nObservation 1. Stricticity on shares implies stricticity on objects, but the converse is false.\nThe following definition will play a prominent role.\nDefinition 2. Given an agent i and a set of objects O, let best(O, i) = argmax\u2113\u2208O W (i, \u2113) be the subset of objects in O having the highest weight for agent i (such objects will be called top objects of i). A (sub-)allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 |O \u2032 is said frustrating if no agent receives one of her top objects in \u2212\u2192\u03c0 |O \u2032 (formally: best(O\u2032, i)\u2229\u2212\u2192\u03c0 |O\u2032\ni = \u2205 for each agent i), and non-frustrating\nif at least one agent receives one of her top objects in \u2212\u2192\u03c0 |O \u2032 .\nIt should be emphasized that this notion of frustrating allocation was already present but implicit in the work by Brams and King [9]. Here, we bring this concept out because it will lead to a nice characterization of sequenceable allocations, as we will see later.\nIn the following, we will consider a particular way of allocating objects to agents: allocation by sequences of sincere choices. Informally the agents are asked in turn, according to a predefined sequence, to choose and pick a top object among the remaining ones.\nDefinition 3. Let I = \u3008A,O,W \u3009 be an add-MARA instance. A sequence of sincere choices (or simply sequence when the context is clear) is a vector of AM . We will denote by S(I) the set of possible sequences for instance I.\nLet \u2212\u2192\u03c3 \u2208 S(I). \u2212\u2192\u03c3 is said to generate allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 if and only if \u2212\u2192\u03c0 can be obtained as a possible result of the non-deterministic2 Algorithm 1 on input I and \u2212\u2192\u03c3 .\n2The algorithm contains an instruction choose splitting the control flow into several branches, building all the allocations generated by \u2212\u2192\u03c3 .\nAlgorithm 1: Execution of a sequence\nInput: an instance I = \u3008A,O,W \u3009 and a sequence \u2212\u2192\u03c3 \u2208 S(I) Output: an allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 \u2208 P(I)\n1 \u2212\u2192\u03c0 \u2190 empty allocation (such that \u2200i \u2208 A : \u03c0i = \u2205); 2 O1 \u2190 O; 3 for t from 1 to M do 4 i \u2190 \u03c3t; 5 choose object ot \u2208 best(Ot, i) ; 6 \u03c0i \u2190 \u03c0i \u222a {ot} ; 7 Ot+1 \u2190 Ot \\ {ot}\nDefinition 4. An allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 is said to be sequenceable if there exists a sequence \u2212\u2192\u03c3 that generates \u2212\u2192\u03c0 , and non-sequenceable otherwise. For a given instance I, we will denote by s(I) the binary relation defined by (\u2212\u2192\u03c3 ,\u2212\u2192\u03c0 ) \u2208 s(I) if and only if \u2212\u2192\u03c0 can be generated by \u2212\u2192\u03c3 .\nExample 1. Let I be the instance represented by the following weight matrix:3\n( 8 2 1 5 1 5 )\nThe binary relation s(I) between S(I) and P(I) can be graphically represented as follows:\nS(I) \u2192 \u30081, 1, 1\u3009 \u30081, 1, 2\u3009 \u30081, 2, 1\u3009 \u30081, 2, 2\u3009 \u30082, 1, 1\u3009 \u30082, 1, 2\u3009 \u30082, 2, 1\u3009 \u30082, 2, 2\u3009\nP(I) \u2192 \u3008123, \u2205\u3009 \u300812, 3\u3009 \u300813, 2\u3009 \u30081, 23\u3009 \u300823, 1\u3009 \u30082, 13\u3009 \u30083, 12\u3009 \u3008\u2205, 123\u3009\nFor instance, sequence \u30082, 1, 2\u3009 generates two possible allocations: \u30081, 23\u3009 and \u30082, 13\u3009, depending on whether agent 2 chooses object 1 or 3 that she both prefers. Allocation \u300812, 3\u3009 can be generated by three sequences. Allocations \u300813, 2\u3009 and \u30083, 12\u3009 are non-sequenceable.\nOnce again, this notion of sequenceability is already implicitly present in the work by Brams and King [9], and has been extensively studied by Aziz et al. [2]. However, a fundamental difference is that in our setting, the preferences might be non strict on objects, which entails that the same sequence can yield different allocations (in the worst case, an exponential number), as Example 1 shows.\nObservation 2. For any instance I, |S(I)| = |P(I)| = NM .\nObservation 3. The number of objects allocated to an agent by a sequence is equal to the number of times the agent appears in the sequence. Formally: for all (\u2212\u2192\u03c3 ,\u2212\u2192\u03c0 ) \u2208 s(I) and all agent i, |\u03c0i| = \u2211 \u2113\u2208O[\u03c3\u2113 = i] where [z = t] is 1 if the equality is verified, and 0 otherwise."}, {"heading": "3 Sequenceable allocations", "text": "In this section and in the following one, we will give a characterization of sequenceable allocations, that is, we will try to identify under which conditions an allocation is achievable by the execution of a sequence of sincere choices. The question has already been extensively studied by Aziz et al. [2], but in a quite different context \u2014 namely, ordinal strict preferences on objects \u2014 and with a particular focus on sub-classes of sequences (e.g. alternating sequences). As we will show, the properties are not completely similar in our context.\n3In this example an in the following ones, we will represent instances by a matrix in which each value at row i and column \u2113 represents the weight W (i, \u2113). We will also use notation ab... as a shorthand for {a, b, ...}"}, {"heading": "3.1 Characterization", "text": "We have seen in Example 1 that some allocations are non-sequenceable. We will now formalize this and give a precise characterization of sequenceable allocations. We first start by noticing that in every sequenceable allocation, the first agent of the sequence gets a top object, which yields the following remark:\nObservation 4. Every frustrating allocation is non-sequenceable.\nExample 2. In the following instance, the circled allocation \u300823, 1\u3009 is non-sequenceable because it is frustrating.\n( 2 1 1 1 2 2 )\nHowever, it is possible to find a non-sequenceable allocation that gives her top object to one agent (as allocation \u300813, 2\u3009 in Example 1) or even to all, as the following example shows.\nExample 3. Consider this instance:\n( 9 8 2 1 2 5 1 4 )\nIn the circled allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 = \u300814, 23\u3009, every agent receives her top object. However, after objects 1 and 2 have been allocated (they must be allocated first by all sequence generating \u2212\u2192\u03c0 ), the sub-allocation shown in a dotted box above remains. This sub-allocation is obviously non-sequenceable because it is frustrating. Hence \u2212\u2192\u03c0 is not sequenceable either.\nThis property of containing a frustrating sub-allocation exactly characterizes the set of non-sequenceable allocations:\nProposition 1. Let I = \u3008A,O,W \u3009 be an instance and \u2212\u2192\u03c0 be an allocation of this instance. The two following statements are equivalent:\n(A) \u2212\u2192\u03c0 is sequenceable.\n(B) No sub-allocation of \u2212\u2192\u03c0 is frustrating (in every sub-allocation, at least one agent receives a top object).\nProof. (B) implies (A). Let us suppose that for all subset of objects O\u2032 \u2286 O there is at least one agent obtaining one of her top objects in \u2212\u2192\u03c0 |O \u2032 . We will constructively show that \u2212\u2192\u03c0 is sequenceable. Let \u2212\u2192\u03c3 be a sequence of agents and \u2212\u2192 O \u2208 (2O)M be a sequence of sets of objects jointly defined as follows:\n\u2022 O1 = O and \u03c31 is an agent that receives one of her top objects in \u2212\u2192\u03c0 |O1;\n\u2022 Ot+1 = Ot \\ {ot}, where ot \u2208 best(Ot, \u03c3t) and \u03c3t is an agent that receives one of her top objects in \u2212\u2192\u03c0 |Ot , for t \u2265 1.\nFrom the assumption on \u2212\u2192\u03c0 , we can check that the sequence \u2212\u2192\u03c3 is perfectly defined. Moreover, \u2212\u2192\u03c0 is one of the allocations generated by \u2212\u2192\u03c3 .\n(A) implies (B) by contraposition. Let \u2212\u2192\u03c0 be an allocation containing a frustrating suballocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 |O \u2032\n. Suppose that there exists a sequence \u2212\u2192\u03c3 generating \u2212\u2192\u03c0 . We can notice that in Algorithm 1, when an object is allocated to an agent, all the objects which are strictly better for her have already been allocated at a previous step. Let \u2113 \u2208 O\u2032, and let i be the agent that receives \u2113 in \u2212\u2192\u03c0 . Since \u2212\u2192\u03c0 |O \u2032\nis frustrating, there is another object m \u2208 O\u2032 such that W (i,m) > W (i, \u2113). From the previous remark, m is necessarily allocated before \u2113 in\nthe execution of sequence \u2212\u2192\u03c3 . We can deduce, from the same line of reasoning on m and agent j that receives it, that there is another object p allocated before m in the execution of the sequence. The set O\u2032 being finite, using the same argument iteratively, we will necessarily find an object which has already been encountered before. This leads to a cycle in the precedence relation of the objects in the execution of the sequence. Contradiction: no sequence can thus generate \u2212\u2192\u03c0 .\nBeyond the fact that it characterizes a sequenceable allocation, the proof of Proposition 1 gives a practical way of checking if an allocation is sequenceable, and, if it is the case, of computing a sequence that generates this allocation. This yields the following result:\nProposition 2. Let I = \u3008A,O,W \u3009 be an instance and \u2212\u2192\u03c0 be an allocation of this instance. We can decide in time O(N \u00d7M2) if \u2212\u2192\u03c0 is sequenceable.\nThe proof of this proposition is based on the execution of a similar algorithm than the one which is used by Brams and King [9] in the proof of their Proposition 1 (necessity). However, our algorithm is more general because (i) it can involve non-strict preferences on objects, and (ii) it can conclude with non-sequenceability.\nProof. We show that Algorithm 2 returns a sequence \u2212\u2192\u03c3 generating the input allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 if and only if there is one. Suppose that the algorithm returns a sequence \u2212\u2192\u03c3 . Then, by definition of the sequence (in the loop from line 2 to line 7), at each step t, i = \u03c3t can choose an object in \u03c0i, that is one of her top objects. Conversely, suppose the algorithm returns Non-sequenceable. Then, at a given step t, \u2200i, best(O\u2032, i) \u2229 \u03c0i = \u2205. By definition, \u2212\u2192\u03c0 |O \u2032 is therefore, at this step, a frustrating sub-allocation of \u2212\u2192\u03c0 . By Proposition 1, \u2212\u2192\u03c0 is thus non-sequenceable. The loop from line 2 to line 7 runs in time O(N \u00d7M), because searching for the top objects in the preferences of each agent can be made in time O(M). This loop being executed M times, the algorithm globally runs in time O(N \u00d7M2).\nAlgorithm 2: Sequencing of an allocation\nInput: an instance I = \u3008A,O,W \u3009 and an allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 \u2208 P(I) Output: a sequence \u2212\u2192\u03c3 generating \u2212\u2192\u03c0 or Non-sequenceable\n1 (\u2212\u2192\u03c3 ,O\u2032) \u2190 (\u3008\u3009,O); 2 for t from 1 to M do 3 if \u2203i such that best(O\u2032, i) \u2229 \u03c0i 6= \u2205 then 4\n\u2212\u2192\u03c3 \u2190 \u2212\u2192\u03c3 \u00b7 i; 5 let \u2113 \u2208 best(O\u2032, i) \u2229 \u03c0i; 6 O\u2032 \u2190 O\u2032 \\ {\u2113};\n7 else return Non-sequenceable 8 return \u2212\u2192\u03c3 ;"}, {"heading": "3.2 Strict preferences on objects", "text": "We now characterize the instances for which the relation s(I) is an application.\nProposition 3.

Let I be an instance with same order preferences, and let \u2212\u2192\u03c0 be an arbitrary allocation. In every sub-allocation of \u2212\u2192\u03c0 at least one agent obtains a top object (because the preference order is the same among agents) and hence cannot be frustrating. By Proposition 1, \u2212\u2192\u03c0 is sequenceable.\nConversely, let us assume for contradiction that I is an instance not having same order preferences. Then there are two distinct objects \u2113 and m and two distinct agents i and j such that W (i, \u2113) \u2265 W (j, \u2113) and W (i,m) \u2264 W (j,m), one of the two inequalities being strict (assume w.l.o.g. the first one). The sub-allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 |{\u2113,m} such that \u03c0 |{\u2113,m} i = {m} and \u03c0 |{\u2113,m} j = {\u2113} is frustrating. By Proposition 1, every allocation\n\u2212\u2192\u03c0 containing this frustrating sub-allocation (hence such that m \u2208 \u03c0i and \u2113 \u2208 \u03c0j) is non-sequenceable.\nLet us now characterize the instances for which the relation s(I) is a bijection.\nProposition 5. For a given instance, the following two statements are equivalent.\n(A) Preferences are strict on objects and same order.\n(B) The relation s(I) is a bijection.\nThe proof of this proposition is an easy consequence of Propositions 3 and 4."}, {"heading": "4 Pareto-optimality", "text": "An allocation is Pareto-optimal if there is no other allocation dominating it. In our context, allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 \u2032 dominates allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 if for all agent i, ui(\u03c0\u2032i) \u2265 ui(\u03c0i) and uj(\u03c0 \u2032 j) > uj(\u03c0j) for at least one agent j. Pareto-optimality formalizes the idea of efficiency: when an allocation is Pareto-optimal, one cannot strictly increase the utility of one agent without strictly decreasing another one\u2019s.\nWhen an allocation is generated from a sequence, in some sense, a weak form of efficiency is applied to build the allocation: each successive (picking) choice is \u201clocally\u201d optimal. This raises a natural question: is every sequenceable allocation Pareto-optimal?\nBrams et al. [9, Proposition 1] answer positively by proving the equivalence between sequenceability and Pareto-optimality. However, they have a different notion of Paretooptimality, because they only have partial ordinal information about the agents\u2019 preferences. More precisely, in Brams and King\u2019s model, the agents\u2019 preferences are given as linear orders over objects (e.g. 1 \u227b 2 \u227b 3 \u227b 4). To be able to compare bundles, these preferences are lifted on subsets using the responsive set extension \u227bRS , which is similar to the one defined in the work by Aziz et al. [1], and to the one defined by Bouveret et al. [5] for SCInets.4 This extension leaves many bundles incomparable (e.g. 14 and 23 if we consider the\n4It is actually not completely clear in Brams and King\u2019s paper whether or not their notion of dominance extends to bundles of different sizes, but it seems to be implicitly the case, using monotonicity.\norder 1 \u227b 2 \u227b 3 \u227b 4). It leads Bouveret et al. [5] to define, among others, two modes of Pareto-optimality: possible and necessary Pareto-optimality. Brams and King\u2019s notion of Pareto-optimality exactly corresponds to possible Pareto-optimality.\nAziz et al. [1] show that, given a linear order \u227b on objects and two bundles \u03c0 and \u03c0\u2032, \u03c0 \u227bRS \u03c0\u2032 if and only if u(\u03c0) > u(\u03c0\u2032) for all additive utility function u compatible with \u227b (that is, such that u(\u2113) > u(m) if and only if \u2113 \u227b m). This characterization of responsive dominance yields the following reinterpretation of Brams and King\u2019s result:\nProposition 6 (Brams and King [9]). Let \u3008\u227b1, . . . ,\u227bN\u3009 be the profile of agents\u2019 ordinal preferences (represented as linear orders). Allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 is sequenceable if and only if for each other allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 \u2032, there is a sequence u1, . . . , uN of additive utility functions, respectively compatible with \u227b1, . . . ,\u227bN such that ui( \u2212\u2192\u03c0 ) > ui( \u2212\u2192\u03c0 \u2032) for at least one agent i.\nThe latter notion of Pareto-optimality is very weak, because the additive utility function is not fixed \u2014 we just have to find one that works. In our context where the utility function is fixed and hence leads to a much stronger notion of Pareto-optimality, there is no reason to suppose that Pareto-optimality is equivalent to sequenceability anymore. And it turns out that it is indeed not the case, as the following example shows.\nExample 4. Let us consider the following instance: (\n5 4 2 8 2 1\n)\nThe sequence \u30081, 2, 2\u3009 generates allocation A = \u30081, 23\u3009 giving utilities \u30085, 3\u3009. A is dominated by B = \u300823, 1\u3009, giving utilities \u30086, 8\u3009 (and generated by \u30082, 1, 1\u3009). Observe that, under ordinal linear preferences, B would not dominate A, but they would be incomparable.\nThe last example shows that a sequence of sincere choices does not necessarily generate a Pareto-optimal allocation (even when the preferences are same order and strict on shares, as the example shows). What about the converse? We can see, as a trivial corollary of the latter reinterpretation of Brams and King\u2019s result, that the answer is positive if the preferences are strict on shares. The following result is more general:\nProposition 7. Every Pareto-optimal allocation is sequenceable.\nBefore giving the formal proof, we illustrate it on a concrete example [7, Example 5].\nExample 5. Let us consider the following instance:\nW =\n\n \n2 12 7 \u202015 \u2020 11\n\u2020 12 15 \u202011 7 2\n15 \u2020 20 9 2 1\n\n \nThe circled allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 is not sequenceable: indeed, every sequence that could generate it should start with \u30083, 2, . . . \u3009, which leaves the frustrating sub-allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c1 appearing in a dotted box above.\nLet us now choose an arbitrary agent who does not receive a top object in \u2212\u2192\u03c1 , for instance agent a1 = 2. Let o1 = 3 be her top object (of weight 11 in this case). The agent receiving o1 in\n\u2212\u2192\u03c1 is a2 = 1. This agent prefers object o2 = 4 (of weight 15), held by a1, already encountered. We have built a cycle (a1, o1) \u2192 (a2, o2) \u2192 (a1, o1), in other words (2, 3) \u2192 (1, 4) \u2192 (2, 3), that tells us exactly how to build another sub-allocation dominating \u2212\u2192\u03c1 . This sub-allocation can be built by replacing in \u2212\u2192\u03c1 the attributions (a1 \u2190 o2)(a2 \u2190 o1) by the attributions (a1 \u2190 o1)(a2 \u2190 o2). Hence, each agent involved in the cycle obtains a strictly better object than the previous one. Doing the same substitutions in the initial allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 yields an allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 \u2032 that dominates \u2212\u2192\u03c0 (marked with \u2020 in the matrix W above).\nNow we will give the formal proof.5\nProof. As stated in the example, we will now prove the contraposition of the proposition: every non-sequenceable allocation is dominated. Let \u2212\u2192\u03c0 be a non-sequenceable allocation. From Proposition 1, in a non-sequenceable allocation, there is at least one frustratring sub-allocation. Let \u2212\u2192\u03c1 be such a sub-allocation (that can be \u2212\u2192\u03c0 itself). We will, from \u2212\u2192\u03c1 , build another sub-allocation dominating it. Let us choose an arbitrary agent a1 involved in \u2212\u2192\u03c1 , receiving an object not among her top ones in \u2212\u2192\u03c1 . Let o1 be a top object of a1 in \u2212\u2192\u03c1 , and let a2 (6= a1) be the unique agent receiving it in\n\u2212\u2192\u03c1 . Let o2 be a top object of a2. We can notice that o2 6= o1 (otherwise a2 would obtain one of her top objects and \u2212\u2192\u03c1 would not be frustrating). Let a3 be the unique agent receiving o2 in\n\u2212\u2192\u03c1 , and so on. Using this argument iteratively, we form a path starting from a1 and alternating agents and objects, in which two successive agents and objects are distinct. Since the number of agents and objects is finite, we will eventually encounter an agent which has been encountered at a previous step of the path. Let ai be the first such agent and ok be the last object seen before her in the sequence (ai is the unique agent receiving ok). We have built a cycle (ai, oi) \u2192 (ai+1, oi+1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (ak, ok) \u2192 (ai, oi) in which all the agents and objects are distinct, and that has at least two agents and two objects. From this cycle, we can modify \u2212\u2192\u03c1 to build a new sub-allocation by giving to each agent in the cycle a top object instead of another less preferred object, all the agents not appearing in the cycle being left unchanged. More formally, the following attributions in \u2212\u2192\u03c1 (and hence in \u2212\u2192\u03c0 ): (ai \u2190 ok)(ai+1 \u2190 oi) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (ak \u2190 ok\u22121) are replaced by: (ai \u2190 oi)(ai+1 \u2190 oi+1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (ak \u2190 ok) where (a \u2190 o) means that o is attributed to a. The same substitutions operated in \u2212\u2192\u03c0 yield an allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 \u2032 that dominates \u2212\u2192\u03c0 .\nCorollary 1. No frustrating allocation can be Pareto-optimal (equivalently, in every Paretooptimal allocation, at least one agent receives a top object).\nProposition 7 implies that there exists, for a given instance, three classes of allocations: (1) non-sequenceable (therefore non Pareto-optimal) allocations, (2) sequenceable but non Pareto-optimal allocations, and (3) Pareto-optimal (hence sequenceable) allocations. These three classes define a \u201cscale of efficiency\u201d that can be used to characterize the allocations. What is interesting and new here is the intermediate level."}, {"heading": "5 Envy-Freeness and CEEI", "text": "In the previous section we have investigated the link that exists between efficiency and sequenceability. The use of sequence of sincere choices can also be motivated by the search for a fair allocation protocol. Therefore, investigating the link between sequenceability and fairness properties is a natural next step. In this section, we will focus on two fairness properties, envy-freeness and competitive equilibrium from equal income, and analyze their link with sequenceability.\nEnvy-freeness [17, 28] is probably one of the most prominent fairness properties. It can be formally expressed in our model as follows.\nDefinition 5. Let I be an add-MARA instance and \u2212\u2192\u03c0 be an allocation. \u2212\u2192\u03c0 verifies the envy-freeness property (or is simply envy-free), when ui(\u03c0i) \u2265 ui(\u03c0j), \u2200(i, j) \u2208 A2 (no agent strictly prefers the share of any other agent).\n5This proof is similar to the proof of Brams and King [9, Proposition 1, necessity]. However, we give it entirely because it is more general, and because we will reuse it in the proof of our Proposition 9. Also note that the central idea of trading cycle is classical and is used, among others, by Varian [28, page 79] and Lipton et al. [24, Lemma 2.2] in the context of envy-freeness.\nThe notion of competitive equilibrium is an old and well-known concept in economics [29, 16]. If equal incomes are imposed among the stakeholders, this concept becomes the competitive equilibrium from equal incomes [25, page 177, for example], yielding a very strong fairness concept which has been recently explored in artificial intelligence [26, 13, 7]. Here is the definition of this concept adapted to our model.\nDefinition 6. Let I = (A,O,W ) be an add-MARA instance, \u2212\u2192\u03c0 an allocation, and \u2212\u2192p \u2208 [0, 1]M a vector of prices. A pair (\u2212\u2192\u03c0 ,\u2212\u2192p ) is said to form a competitive equilibrium from equal incomes (CEEI) if\n\u2200i \u2208 A : \u03c0i \u2208 argmax\u03c0\u2286O\n{\nui(\u03c0) : \u2211\n\u2113\u2208\u03c0\np\u2113 \u2264 1\n}\n.\nIn other words, \u03c0i is one of the maximal shares that i can buy with a budget of 1, provided that the price of each object \u2113 is p\u2113.\nWe will say that allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 satisfies the CEEI test (is a CEEI allocation for short) if there exists a vector \u2212\u2192p such that (\u2212\u2192\u03c0 ,\u2212\u2192p ) forms a CEEI.\nAs we have shown in a previous work [7], every CEEI allocation is envy-free in the model we use (additive, numerical preferences). In this section, we investigate the question of whether an envy-free or CEEI allocation is necessarily sequenceable.\nFor envy-freeness, the answer is negative.\nProposition 8. There exist non-sequenceable envy-free allocations, even if the agents\u2019 preferences are strict on shares.\nProof. A counterexample with strict preferences on shares is given in Example 5 above, for which we can check that the circled allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 is envy-free and non-sequenceable.\nInterestingly, for CEEI, however, the answer is positive.\nProposition 9. Every CEEI allocation is sequenceable.\nIt should be noted that we already know that every CEEI allocation is Pareto-optimal if the preferences are strict on shares [7, Proposition 8]. From Observation 1 and Proposition 7, if the preferences are strict on shares, then every CEEI allocation is sequenceable. Proposition 9 is more general: no assumption is made on the stricticity of preferences on shares (nor on objects). Note that a CEEI allocation can be ordinally necessary Pareto-dominated, as the following example shows.\n\n \u2020 2 \u20203 3 2 2 3 \u2020 4 1 0 4 2 \u20204\n\n\nThe circled allocation is CEEI (with prices 0.5, 1, 1, 0.5) but is ordinally necessary (hence also additively) dominated by the allocation marked with \u2020.\nProof. We will show that no allocation can be at the same time non-sequenceable and CEEI. Let \u2212\u2192\u03c0 be a non-sequenceable allocation. We can use the same terms and notations than in the proof of Proposition 7, especially concerning the dominance cycle.\nLet C be the set of agents concerned by the cycle. \u2212\u2192\u03c0 contains the following shares:\n\u03c0ai = {ok} \u222a \u03c4i \u03c0ai+1 = {oi} \u222a \u03c4i+1 .... \u03c0ak = {ok\u22121} \u222a \u03c4k\nwhereas the allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 \u2032 that dominates it, contains the following shares:\n\u03c0\u2032ai = {oi} \u222a \u03c4i \u03c0 \u2032 ai+1 = {oi+1} \u222a \u03c4i+1 .... \u03c0 \u2032 ak = {ok} \u222a \u03c4k\nthe other shares being unchanged from \u2212\u2192\u03c0 to \u2212\u2192\u03c0 \u2032. Suppose that \u2212\u2192\u03c0 is CEEI. This allocation must satisfy two kinds of constraints. First, \u2212\u2192\u03c0 must satisfy the price constraint. If we write p(\u03c0) def = \u2211\n\u2113\u2208\u03c0 p\u2113,\n\u2200i \u2208 C : p(\u03c0i) \u2264 1 (1)\nNext, \u2212\u2192\u03c0 must be optimal: every share having a higher utility for an agent than her share in \u2212\u2192\u03c0 costs strictly more than 1. Provided that \u2200i \u2208 C : ui(\u03c0\u2032i) > ui(\u03c0i) (because\n\u2212\u2192\u03c0 \u2032 substitutes more preferred objects to less preferred objects in \u2212\u2192\u03c0 ), this constraint can be written as\n\u2200i \u2208 C : p(\u03c0\u2032i) > 1 (2)\nBy summing equations 1 and 2, provided that all shares are disjoint, we obtain\np(\u222aj\u2208C\u03c0j) \u2264 |C| and p(\u222aj\u2208C\u03c0 \u2032 j) > |C|\nYet, \u222aj\u2208C\u03c0j = \u222ai\u2208C\u03c0\u2032j (because the allocation \u2212\u2192\u03c0 \u2032 is obtained from \u2212\u2192\u03c0 by simply swapping objects between agents in C). The two previous equations are contradictory."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments", "text": "We have exhibited in Section 4, a \u201cscale of allocation efficiency\u201d, made of three steps: nonsequenceable (NS), sequenceable and non Pareto-optimal (SnP), and Pareto-optimal (PO). A natural question is to know, for a given instance, which proportion of allocations are located at each level of the scale. We give a first answer in this section by experimentally characterizing the distribution of allocations between the different levels. Moreover, we analyze the relation between fairness and efficiency by linking this scale of efficiency with the scale of fairness introduced in a previous work [7]. This scale of fairness has six levels, from the weakest to the strongest property: no criterion satisfied (\u2013), maxmin share (MFS), proportionality (PFS), minmax share (mFS), envy-freeness (EF) and CEEI.\nOur experimental protocol is the following. We have generated 100 add-MARA instances with 3 agents and 10 objects, reusing the uniform and Gaussian random allocation protocol described in our previous work [7]. For each of these instances, we have generated the set of possible allocations (310 = 59049) and identified the highest level of fairness and the level of efficiency of each one. We want to emphasize that a particular difficulty was here to implement the CEEI test. This problem has been proved to be coNP-hard [12, Theorem 49] and to the best of our knowledge no practical method have been described yet, even for small numbers of objects and agents. The method we have developed for this problem is described in appendix and works in practice for problems up to 5 agents and 20 objects.\nFigure 1 gives a graphical overview of the results. In this figure, the histograms represent the average value (on all the instances) of the set of allocations by pair of criteria (the minmax interval has been represented with error bars), using a logarithmic scale. The three curves represent the average proportion, by fairness criterion, of the number of allocations satisfying the three efficiency criteria, using a linear scale.\nWe can observe several interesting facts. First, a huge majority of allocations do not have any efficiency nor fairness property (first black bar on the left). Secondly, the distribution of the allocations on the scale of efficiency seems to be correlated to the fairness criteria: a higher proportion of sequenceable allocations can be found among the envy-free allocations\nthan among the allocations that do not satisfy any fairness property, and for CEEI allocations and uniform generation, there are even more Pareto-optimal allocations that just sequenceable ones. Third, there is a higher proportion of allocations satisfying fairness and efficiency properties for the uniform generation model. Even if this seems logical for fairness (because a \u201csimilar\u201d attraction for the objects \u2014 as in the Gaussian model \u2014 is more likely to create conflicts among agents), the explanation is not so clear for efficiency."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "Sequences of sincere choices are arguably a remarkable protocol for allocating a set of indivisible goods to agents. This protocol, known for ages, has received a lot of interest in recent years by researchers both in economics and computer science. In this paper, following the work by Brams et al. [9], we have shown that this protocol, beyond being appealing in practice, also has a theoretical interest in the context of numerical additive preferences. Namely, it can be used to characterize the efficiency of an allocation by defining an intermediate level between Pareto-optimality and no efficiency at all. Moreover, we have introduced the simple notion of frustrating (sub-)allocation and shown that it can be used to exactly characterize the set of sequenceable allocations. We also have characterized the set of instances for which there is an exact one-to-one relation between allocations and sequences. Finally, we have emphasized some links between fairness properties (especially CEEI) and efficiency criteria. Although being technically simple, we believe that these results are new and shed an interesting light on sequences of sincere choices and Pareto-optimality.\nThis work opens up to some interesting questions, such as the impact of restrictions on sequences like alternating sequences. Another interesting topic is the relation between this protocol and social welfare orderings, with questions such as the loss of social welfare incurred by the execution of a sequence compared to the optimal allocation (price of sequenceability).\nAcknowledgements We thank the anonymous reviewers of AAMAS\u201916 for their valuable comments."}], "references": [{"title": "Fair assignment of indivisible objects under ordinal preferences", "author": ["Haris Aziz", "Serge Gaspers", "Simon Mackenzie", "Toby Walsh"], "venue": "Artificial Intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Possible and necessary allocations via sequential mechanisms", "author": ["Haris Aziz", "Toby Walsh", "Lirong Xia"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2015}, {"title": "The Santa Claus problem", "author": ["N.

We point out similarities and differences with this latter context. In particular, we show that any Paretooptimal allocation (under additive preferences) is sequenceable, but that the converse is not true anymore. This asymmetry leads naturally to the definition of a \u201cscale of efficiency\u201d having three steps: Pareto-optimality, sequenceability without Paretooptimality, and non-sequenceability. Finally, we investigate the links between these efficiency properties and the \u201cscale of fairness\u201d we have described in an earlier work [7]: we first show that an allocation can be envy-free and non-sequenceable, but that every competitive equilibrium with equal incomes is sequenceable.
