Scientific progress in many disciplines is increasingly enabled by our ability to examine natural phenomena through the computational lens, i.e., using algorithmic or information processing abstractions of the underlying processes; and our ability to acquire, share, integrate and analyze disparate types of data. However, there is a huge gap between our ability to acquire, store, and process data and our ability to make effective use of the data to advance discovery. Despite successful automation of routine aspects of data management and analytics, most elements of the scientific process currently require considerable human expertise and effort. Accelerating science to keep pace with the rate of data acquisition and data processing calls for the development of algorithmic or information processing abstractions, coupled with formal methods and tools for modeling and simulation of natural processes as well as major innovations in cognitive tools for scientists, i.e., computational tools that leverage and extend the reach of human intellect, and partner with humans on a broad range of tasks in scientific discovery (e.g., identifying, prioritizing formulating questions, designing, prioritizing and executing experiments designed to answer a chosen question, drawing inferences and evaluating the results, and formulating new questions, in a closed-loop fashion). This calls for concerted research agenda aimed at: Development, analysis, integration, sharing, and simulation of algorithmic or information processing abstractions of natural processes, coupled with formal methods and tools for their analyses and simulation; Innovations in cognitive tools that augment and extend human intellect and partner with humans in all aspects of science. This is particularly important given that, as the development and use of computational tools for understanding natural processes, such as human cognition and AI are increasingly difficult to obtain, the science that advances these technologies is currently challenging. Moreover, with increasing interest in improving the human intellect and its ability to understand the natural processes of natural processes, this approach will likely require the development and development of advanced methods of human intelligence and AI.\n\n\n\n\nThe emergence of \"big data\" presents unprecedented opportunities for not only accelerating scientific advances but also enabling new modes of discovery.

\u00a0 Chalmers, \u00a0 1999; \u00a0 Rosenberg, \u00a0 2000 \u00a0 for \u00a0 reviews). \u00a0 Figure \u00a0 1 \u00a0 summarizes \u00a0 the \u00a0 key \u00a0 elements \u00a0 of \u00a0 the \u00a0 scientific \u00a0process. \u00a0\nTypically, \u00a0 scientific \u00a0 inquiry \u00a0 starts \u00a0 with \u00a0 a \u00a0 question \u00a0 within \u00a0 a \u00a0 domain \u00a0 of \u00a0 study, \u00a0 e.g., \u00a0 biology. \u00a0 With \u00a0 the \u00a0 question \u00a0 in \u00a0 hand, \u00a0 one \u00a0 has \u00a0 to \u00a0 assemble \u00a0 the \u00a0 background \u00a0 information \u00a0 and \u00a0 acquire \u00a0 the \u00a0 data \u00a0 necessary \u00a0 to \u00a0 answer \u00a0 the \u00a0 question. \u00a0 Then \u00a0 one \u00a0 proceeds \u00a0 to \u00a0 construct \u00a0 one \u00a0 or \u00a0more \u00a0models \u00a0 from \u00a0data \u00a0 (and \u00a0 background \u00a0 information). \u00a0 Choosing \u00a0 a \u00a0 small \u00a0 set \u00a0 of \u00a0 models \u00a0 from \u00a0 among \u00a0 a \u00a0 much \u00a0 larger \u00a0 set \u00a0 of \u00a0 candidates \u00a0 involves \u00a0 additional \u00a0 considerations \u00a0 (simplicity, \u00a0consistency \u00a0with \u00a0what \u00a0else \u00a0 is \u00a0known), \u00a0etc. \u00a0The \u00a0models \u00a0can \u00a0be \u00a0used \u00a0to \u00a0advance \u00a0hypotheses \u00a0 that \u00a0 result, \u00a0 ideally, \u00a0 in \u00a0 testable \u00a0 predictions. \u00a0 The \u00a0 observations \u00a0 or \u00a0 experiments \u00a0 designed \u00a0 to \u00a0 test \u00a0 the \u00a0 predictions \u00a0yield \u00a0additional \u00a0data \u00a0that
