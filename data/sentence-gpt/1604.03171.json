Our framework captures all of the most prominent examples of \"simple\" auctions, including anonymous and non-anonymous item and bundle pricings, with either a single or multiple buyers. The technique we propose is to break the analysis of auctions into two natural pieces: \"fancy\" and \"bustle\" (which are often used to identify a product with a price on sale) and \"bustle\" (which are often used to identify a product with a price on sale) for the most recent period of time.\n\n\n\nThe term \"bustle\" is widely used by both classical economists and the classical economists as a definition of what \"Bustle\" means, and \"bustle\" is used in the case of classical economists such as Ricardo (1657) and Robert Lewandowski (1921). While this formulation is very straightforward (at least in practice, most of the formalist argument is quite convincing, but only for short periods of time, because the only real possibility of making use of this term is that many of the more sophisticated economists like Robert Lewandowski and Robert Lewandowski think of it as a generalization of the phrase, \"Bustle\" is still very important to their \"fancy\" arguments, because the very real possibility of making use of this term is that many of the more sophisticated economists like Robert Lewandowski and Robert Lewandowski think of it as a generalization of the phrase, \"Bustle\" is still very important to their \"fancy\" arguments, because the very real possibility of making use of this term is that many of the more sophisticated economists like Robert Lewandowski and Robert Lewandowski think of it as a generalization of the phrase, \"Bustle\" is still very important to their \"fancy\" arguments, because the very real possibility of making use of this term is that many of the more sophisticated economists like Robert Lewandowski and Robert Lewandowski think of it as a generalization of the phrase, \"Bustle\" is still very important to their \"fancy\" arguments, because the very real possibility of making use of this term is that many of the more sophisticated economists like Robert Lewandowski and Robert Lewandowski think of it as a generalization of the phrase, \"Bustle\" is still very important to their \"fancy\" arguments, because the very real possibility of", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Apr 2016 22:51:04 GMT  (54kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03171v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.GT", "authors": ["jamie morgenstern", "tim roughgarden"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.03171"}, "pdf": {"name": "1604.03171.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Learning Simple Auctions", "authors": ["Jamie Morgenstern", "Tim Roughgarden"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar X\niv :1\n60 4.\n03 17\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n1 A\npr 2\n01 6"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "The standard economic approach for designing revenue-maximizing auctions assumes all information unknown to the designer is drawn from some prior distribution, about which the designer has perfect information. With this \u201cperfect\u201d prior in hand, the designer fine-tunes an auction to optimize for her expected revenue over draws of the unknown information from the prior. While this model allows for quite strong results relating her chosen auction\u2019s revenue to the optimal revenue, three related difficulties arise from using this design pattern in practice. First, for any particular setting, it is unlikely that the designer could actually formulate a perfect prior over the market\u2019s hidden information. Second, if the market designer has an imperfect prior, it is possible that her optimal auction has overfit to this prior and will have very poor revenue when run on the (similar) true prior. Finally, the optimal auction for a particular prior can be quite complicated and unintuitive.\nThese obstacles can be addressed in a rigorous manner by designing auctions as a function of several samples of the unknown data (usually, buyers\u2019 valuations) drawn from an unknown distribution, with the knowledge that our goal is to earn high revenue on a fresh draw from the same distribution. It is reasonable to expect that experienced sellers have previous records of the bids made by previous participants in their market. Moreover, if an auction is guaranteed perform well on future draws from a distribution to which it only had sample access, it will have strong generalization properties if its sample size was sufficiently large.\nHow many samples are necessary to achieve such a guarantee? The answer depends upon the complexity of the set of auctions the seller might select. The more complex the class of auctions, the lower the class\u2019s \u201crepresentation error\u201d (the higher the revenue the seller might be able to extract); on the other hand, a more complex class of auctions will have higher \u201cgeneralization error\u201d (loss in revenue from optimizing over the sample rather than the true prior) for a fixed sample size.\nThe mechanism design community has placed \u201csimplicity\u201d as a design goal for its own sake for single-parameter (Hartline and Roughgarden, 2009) and multi-parameter (Chawla et al., 2007, 2010; Babaioff et al., 2014; Rubinstein and Weinberg, 2015) auctions.1 Recent work (Morgenstern and Roughgarden, 2015) proposed the use of a class\u2019s pseudo-\n1A canonical \u201csingle-parameter\u201d problem is a single-item auction \u2014 each bidder either \u201cwins\u201d or \u201closes\u201d. A canonical \u201cmulti-parameter\u201d problem is a multi-item auction \u2014 with k items, each bidder faces 2k different possibilities. Multi-parameter problems are well known to be much more ill-behaved than single-parameter problems. For example, there is no general multi-parameter analog of Myerson\u2019s (single-parameter) theory of revenue-maximizing auctions Myerson (1981).\ndimension as a formal notion of simplicity for single-parameter auctions, and proves for general single-parameter settings there exist classes of auctions with small representation error (which contain a nearly-optimal auction) and have small pseudo-dimension or generalization error (a polynomial-sized sample suffices to learn a nearly-optimal auction from that class).\nIn this work, we give a general framework for bounding the pseudo-dimension of classes of multi-parameter auctions. Our results imply polynomial sample complexity bounds for revenue maximization over all of the aforementioned \u201csimple\u201d auctions. In effect, our results imply that whenever it\u2019s possible to compute a near-optimal simple auction with a known prior, it is also possible to compute such an auction with an unknown prior (given a polynomial number of samples).\nOne concrete example of a class of well-studied \u201csimple\u201d multi-parameter auctions comes from Babaioff et al. (2014). Consider a single bidder whose valuation is additive over k items: there is a vector v \u2208 Rk such that the bidder\u2019s valuation for a bundle B \u2286 [k] is \u2211\nj\u2208B vj . An item pricing is defined by a vector p \u2208 R k, and offers the\nagent any bundle B for price \u2211\nj\u2208B pj . A grand bundle pricing is defined by a single real number q \u2208 R and offers the bundle B = [k] for the price q. When a single additive buyer\u2019s valuation v \u223c D1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 Dk is drawn from a product distribution, either the best item pricing or the best grand-bundle pricing will earn 1/6 of optimal revenue. Babaioff et al. (2014) assume that the Dj\u2019s are known a priori and choose item and bundle prices as a function of the distributions. Can we instead learn from samples the best auction from the class consisting of all item and bundle prices? The main result in Babaioff et al. (2014) provides a bound on the representation error of this class; our work provides the first sample complexity bound (for this and many other classes).\nOur Main Results We present a general framework for bounding sample complexity for \u201csimple\u201d combinatorial auctions, when considering auctions as functions from valuations to revenue. Formally, we study the following question, and provide a technique for answering it in many interesting cases:\nGiven a class of multiparameter auctions C : Vn \u2192 R (each auction maps any n-tuple of combinatorial valuations to the revenue achieved by the auction on those valuations), how large must m be such that the empirical revenue maximizer in C over m samples drawn from D earns OPT (C) \u2212 \u01eb expected revenue on fresh sample drawn from D?\nOur main technical contributions are first to show a general way to measure the sample complexity of singlebuyer mechanisms, which are interesting in their own right, and second to show a reduction in bounding the sample complexity for the multi-buyer auctions to bounding the sample complexity of single-buyer auctions. This reduction and our general framework apply to all known multi-buyer simple auctions from the literature. We then instantiate this framework and show that it is flexible enough to bound the sample complexity of a large class of simple auction classes from the literature. In particular, we bound the pseudo-dimension of item pricings, grand bundle pricings, and second-price item or bundle auctions with reserves, covering the set of known simple auctions which approximately optimize revenue. The following table summarizes our results, as well as the known approximation guarantees these auctions provide. We note that Theorem D.1 is proven using a direct argument rather than this framework.\nSummary of Simple Auction Properties Class Valuations PD anon, nonanon Rev APX anonymous Rev APX nonanonymous Grand bundle pricing General O(1), O(n) Corollary 4.3 Item Pricing General O\u0303(k2), O\u0303(k2n),\nCorollary 4.4 3 (1 unit-demand bidder) (Chawla et al., 2007)\n10.7 (n unit-demand bidders) (Chawla et al., 2010)\nItem and Grand Bundle Pricing General O\u0303(k2), O\u0303(k2n) 6 (1 additive bidder) (Babaioff et al., 2014) 312 (1 subadditive bidder) (Rubinstein and Weinberg, 2015)\nAdditive O\u0303(k), O\u0303(kn), Theorem D.1\nSecond-price item auctions with item reserves Additive O\u0303(k2), O\u0303(k2n), Corollary 4.5\n48 (n additive buyers), (Yao, 2015)\nO\u0303(k), O\u0303(kn), Theorem D.1\nThese results imply that a polynomial-sized sample suffices to learn a nearly-optimal auction from these classes of simple auctions. Thus, when combined with results from the literature, it is possible to learn auctions which earn a constant-factor of optimal revenue for a single additive (Babaioff et al., 2014) or subadditive bidder (Rubinstein and Weinberg, 2015), n unit-demand bidders (Chawla et al., 2010), and n additive bidders (Yao, 2015).2\nFor many classes of auctions, our sample complexity bounds do not rely on any structural assumptions about buyers\u2019 valuations (only that their utilities are quasilinear in money and that they will behave by maximizing their own utility). We point to this flexibility as a key feature of our techniques: for bidders with general valuation functions, it can be quite complicated to reason about bidder\u2019s behavior directly. We also formally describe the allocations of these auction classes as coming from sequential allocation procedures all drawn from the same class, and show any class which has allocations which can be described this way also has a provably simple class of allocation functions. This reduction may be of independent interest for proving other classes of auctions have small sample complexity."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related Work", "text": "There has been a recent surge in the design of single-parameter revenue-maximizing auctions3 from samples (Elkind, 2007; Balcan et al., 2007, 2008a; Cole and Roughgarden, 2014; Huang et al., 2015; Medina and Mohri, 2014; Roughgarden and Schrijvers, 2015; Morgenstern and Roughgarden, 2015; Devanur et al., 2015); we focus here on the problem of designing auctions from samples for multi-parameter settings. Optimal auctions for combinatorial settings are substantially more complex than for single-parameter settings, even before introducing questions of sample complexity. Item pricings in particular have been the subject of much study with respect to their constant approximations when buyers\u2019 values for items are independent,4 for welfare (Kelso Jr and Crawford, 1982; Feldman et al., 2015) and revenue in the worst-case for for a single (Chawla et al., 2007) and n unit-demand bidders (Chawla et al., 2010), a single (Babaioff et al., 2014) additive buyers, and a single subadditive buyer (Rubinstein and Weinberg, 2015).5 For the additive and subadditive buyer results, the theorems state that the better of the best item pricing and best grand bundle pricing achieve a constant factor of optimal revenue. Combining the result of Babaioff et al. (2014) and a recent result of Yao (2015), it is possible to earn a constant factor of optimal revenue for n additive buyers using the better of the best grand bundle pricing and an auction format related to item pricing (the second-price item auction with item-specific reserve prices). All n-buyer results for revenue rely on the use of nonanonymous item and grand bundle pricings. These results can be thought of as bounding the representation error of using these classes of auctions for revenue maximization; our work can be thought of as complementing these results by bounding the classes\u2019 generalization error.\nItem pricings are also sufficiently simple that the sample complexity of choosing welfare-optimal (Feldman et al., 2015; Hsu et al., 2016) and revenue-optimal (Balcan et al., 2008a) item pricings has been explored. Balcan et al. (2008a) study the sample complexity of anonymous item pricing for combinatorial auctions with unlimited supply and employ one technique which bears some resemblance to our framework. Fixing a sample of size m, they bound the number of distinct allocation labelings L of that sample by anonymous item pricing using a geometric interpretation of anonymous pricings. Such an argument seems difficult to extend to other classes of auctions (for example, nonanonymous item pricings). We ultimately suggest the use of linear separability as a tool to bound L, an argument which applies to many distinct classes of auctions with finite supply, and doesn\u2019t rely on the particular geometry of anonymous item pricings.\nWe use the concept of linear separability (Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz, 2014) to prove bounds on the pseudodimension of many classes of auctions; this tool was also used by Balcan et al. (2014) in studying the sample complexity of learning the valuation function of a single buyer when goods are divisible and the valuation functions are either additive, Leontiff, or Separable Piecewise-Linear Concave; our results apply to multiple bidders, when items are\n2Our framework also applies to learning simple auctions with good welfare guarantees, as in Feldman et al. (2015); all that changes is the real-valued function associated with an auction. Welfare guarantees are simpler than revenue guarantees (since the objective function value depends on the allocation only) so we concentrate on the latter.\n3A generalization of single-item auctions, where each buyer can be described by a single real number representing her value for being selected as a winner.\n4Dughmi et al. (2014) show that when items\u2019 values are allowed to be correlated, for a single unit-demand bidder, the sample complexity required to compute a constant-factor approximation to the optimal auction is necessarily exponential (in m).\n5For more general valuation profiles and without item-wise independence, it is known that item pricings can also achieve super-constant revenue approximations, see Balcan et al. (2008b); Chakraborty et al. (2013).\nindivisible, and most of them to arbitrary valuation classes (including superadditive valuations). Hsu et al. (2016) also studied the linear separability and used it to bound the pseudo-dimension of welfare maximization for item pricings as well as the concentration of demand for any particular good."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "Bayesian Mechanism Design Preliminaries In this section, we provide the definitions and main results regarding simple multi-parameter mechanism design necessary for proving our main results. We consider the problem of selling k heterogeneous items to n bidders. Each bidder i \u2208 [n] can be described by a combinatorial valuation function vi \u2208 V \u2286 (2k \u2192 R), and is assumed to be quasilinear in money, meaning that her utility for a bundle B with price p(B) is exactly ui(B, p) = vi(B) \u2212 p(B). We will assume all valuation functions are monotone, v(B) \u2264 v(B\u2032) for all B \u2286 B\u2032. An auction A is comprised of an allocation rule A1 : Vn \u2192 [n]k and a payment rule A2 : Vn \u2192 Rn. We will only consider direct revelation mechanisms, for which it is the best-response for any buyer to reveal vi to any mechanism A. The valuation function vi is assumed to be known to agent i but not to the designer of the auction, who must choose an auction A before observing v1, . . . , vn.\nWe will assume that bidder i\u2019s valuation is drawn independently from some distribution Di over valuation profiles. We assume the support of the distribution D = D1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Dn is in [0, H ]n. We will refer to the revenue of an auction A on a particular instance v = (v1, . . . , vn) as \u2211\ni A2(v)i, and the (expected) revenue of A as REV(A,D) = Ev\u223cD[ \u2211 iA2(v)i]. When a bidder\u2019s valuation vi can be represented as vi1, . . . , vik such that vi(S) = \u2211\nj\u2208S vij , we say that i is additive; when vi can be represented as k numbers vi1, . . . , vik such that vi(S) = maxj\u2208S vij , we say that i is unit-demand. If, for all S, T \u2286 [k], vi(S) + vi(T ) \u2265 vi(S \u222a T ), we say vi is subadditive.\nSeveral particular kinds of auctions are of particular use when (approximately) optimizing for revenue in multiparameter settings. An auction is an (anonymous) item pricing if it sets price pj for each item j \u2208 [k], and offers buyers in some fixed order any bundle B of remaining items for price \u2211\nj\u2208B pj ; each buyer then chooses the bundle maximizing her utility. An auction is a non-anonymous item pricing if it sets price pij for each j \u2208 [k], i \u2208 [n], and offers buyers in some fixed order any bundle B of remaining items; buyer i will be offered B for a price of \u2211\nj\u2208B pij . An anonymous (or nonanonymous) grand bundle pricing sets a single price p (pi) for the \u201cgrand\u201d bundle [k] of all items, and offers the grand bundle to buyers in some fixed order until the grand bundle is sold. Throughout the paper, we will assume this fixed order is fixed (namely, not a parameter of the design space), and that it places bidder 1 first in the ordering, 2 second, and so on. When buyers are additive, we will also consider the second-price item auction, which sells each item to the highest bidder for that item at the second-highest bid for that item, and the second-price grand bundle auction which sells the grand bundle to the highest bidder for it at the second-highest bid. Finally, we will consider the second-price item (grand-bundle) auction with both anonymous and non-anonymous item reserves, which sell to the highest bidder for that item at the maximum of the second-highest bid and the item\u2019s reserve (for that bidder), or to no one if the highest bidder\u2019s bid is below her reserve. These auction classes achieve constant-factor approximations for revenue in many special cases: for one (Chawla et al., 2007) and n (Chawla et al., 2010) unitdemand bidders, for one (Babaioff et al., 2014) and n (Yao, 2015) bidders, and for one subadditive bidder (Rubinstein and Weinberg, 2015) (see Section C, where we have included the formal theorem statements for completeness).\nLearning Theory Preliminaries In this section, we provide definitions and useful tools for bounding the sample complexity of learning a class of real-valued functions F . We omit discussion of binary-labeled learning and the definitions of uniform versus PAC learning for reasons of space (see Section B for further details).\nReal-Valued Labels Both PAC learnability and uniform learnability of binary-valued functions can be well-characterized in terms of the class\u2019s VC dimension. When learning real-valued functions (for example, to guarantee convergence of the revenue of various auctions), we use a real-valued analog to VC dimension (which will give a sufficient but not necessary condition for uniform convergence). We will work with the pseudo-dimension (Pollard, 1984), one standard generalization. Formally, let c : V \u2192 [0, H ] be a real-valued function over V , and F be the class we are learning over. Let S be a sample drawn from D, |N | = m, labeled according to c. Both the empirical and true error of a hypothesis c\u0302 are defined as before, though |c\u0302(v) \u2212 c(v)| can now take on values in [0, H ] rather than in {0, 1}. Let\n(r1, . . . , rm) \u2208 [0, H ]m be a set of targets for N . We say (r1, . . . , rm) witnesses the shattering of N by F if, for each T \u2286 N , there exists some cT \u2208 F such that cT (vq) \u2265 rq for all vq \u2208 T and cT (vq) < rq for all vq /\u2208 T . If there exists some ~r witnessing the shattering of N , we say N is shatterable by F . The pseudo-dimension of F , denoted PD(F), is the size of the largest set S which is shatterable by F . We will derive sample complexity upper bounds from the following theorem, which connects the sample complexity of uniform learning over a class of real-valued functions to the pseudo-dimension of the class.\nTheorem 2.1 (E.g. Anthony and Bartlett (1999)) Suppose F is a class of real-valued functions with range in [0, H ] and pseudo-dimension PD(F). For every \u01eb > 0, \u03b4 \u2208 [0, 1], the sample complexity of (\u01eb, \u03b4)-uniformly learning the class F is\nn = O\n(\n(\nH\n\u01eb\n)2(\nPD(F) ln H\n\u01eb + ln\n1\n\u03b4\n)\n)\n.\nMoreover, a conceptually simple algorithm achieves the guarantee in Theorem 2.1: simply output the function c \u2208 F with the smallest empirical error on the sample. These algorithms are called empirical risk minimizers.\nMulti-Labeled Learning The main goal of our work is to bound the sample complexity of revenue maximization for multi-parameter classes of auctions (via bounding these classes\u2019 pseudo-dimension); our proofs first bound the number of labelings of purchased bundles which these auctions can induce on a sample of size m. Then, we argue about the behavior of the revenue of all auctions which agree on the purchased bundles for every sample to bound the pseudo-dimension. Since bundles are neither binary nor real-valued, we now briefly mention several tools which we use for learning in the so-called multi-label setting.\nThe first of these tools is that of compression schemes for a class of functions.\nDefinition 2.2 A compression scheme for F : V \u2192 Y , of size d consists of\n\u2022 a compression function compress : (V \u00d7 Y)m \u2192 (V \u00d7 Y)d,\nwhere compress(N) \u2286 N and d \u2264 m; and\n\u2022 a decompression function decompress : (V \u00d7 Y)d \u2192 F .\nFor any f \u2208 F and any sample (v1, f(v1)), . . . , (vm, f(vm)), the functions satisfy\ndecompress \u25e6 compress((v1, f(v1)), . . . , (vm, f(vm))) = f \u2032 \u2208 F\nwhere f \u2032(vq) = f(vq) for each q \u2208 [m].\nIntuitively, a compression function selects a subset of d \u201cmost relevant\u201d points from a sample, and based on these points, the decompression scheme selects a hypothesis. When such a scheme exists, the learning algorithm decompress \u25e6 compress is an empirical risk minimizer. Furthermore, this compression-based learning algorithm has sample complexity bounded by a function of d, which plays a role analogous to VC dimension in the sample complexity guarantees.\nTheorem 2.3 (Littlestone and Warmuth (1986)) Suppose F has a compression scheme of size d. Then, the PAC complexity of F is at most m = O ( d ln 1 \u01eb +ln 1 \u03b4\n\u01eb\n)\n.\nWhile compression schemes imply useful sample complexity bounds, it can be hard to show that a particular hypothesis class admits a compression scheme. One general technique is to show that the class is linearly separable in a higher-dimensional space.\nDefinition 2.4 A class F is d-dimensionally linearly separable if there exists a function \u03c8 : V \u00d7Y \u2192 Rd and for any f \u2208 F , there exists some wf \u2208 Rd with f(v) \u2208 argmaxy\u3008w f , \u03c8(v, y)\u3009 and |argmaxy\u3008w f , \u03c8(v, y)\u3009| = 1.\nIt is known that a d-dimensional linearly separable class admits a compression scheme of size d.\nTheorem 2.5 (Theorem 5 of Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz (2014)) Suppose F is d-dimensionally linearly separable. Then, there exists a compression scheme for F of size d.\nIf a class is linearly separable, this greatly restricts the number of labelings it can induce on a sample of size m, a trick used in Hsu et al. (2016) and also in the next section of this paper.\nWe also briefly mention that if a class F is linearly separable, post-processing the class with a fixed function also yields a linearly separable class over the resulting label space.\nObservation 1 Suppose F is d-dimensionally linearly separable over Q. Fix some q : Q \u2192 Q\u2032. Then, the set q \u25e6 F = {q \u25e6 f |f \u2208 F} is d-dimensionally linearly separable over Q\u2032.\nWith these tools in hand, our roadmap is as follows: for a class of auctions, we first prove that the class (which labels valuations by utility-maximizing bundles purchased) is linearly separable, which then implies an upper-bound on how many distinct bundle labelings one can have for a fixed sample. Then, we argue about the pseudo-dimension of the class (which labels a valuation by the revenue achieved when that agent buys her utility-maximizing bundle) by considering only those auctions which all have the same bundle labeling of m samples and arguing about the behavior of revenue of those auctions."}, {"heading": "3 A Framework for Bounding Pseudo-dimension Via Intermediate Discrete Labels", "text": "We now propose a new framework for bounding the pseudo-dimension of many well-structured classes of real-valued functions. Suppose F is some set of real-valued functions whose pseudo-dimension we wish to bound. Suppose that, for each f \u2208 F , f can be \u201cfactored\u201d into a pair of functions (f1, f2) such that f2(f1(x), x) = f(x) for any x. There are always \u201ctrivial\u201d factorings, where the function f2 = f or f1(x) = x, but the interesting case arises when both f1(x) and f2 (fixing f1(x)) depend in a very limited way upon x. In particular, if the set of functions {f1} are very structured, and fixing f1(x) the set of functions {f2} only depend upon x in some very mild way, this will imply that F itself has small pseudo-dimension. Intuitively, this will allow us to \u201cbucket\u201d functions by their values according to f1 on some sample, and bound the pseudo-dimension of each of those buckets separately.\nOur particular technique for showing such a property is first to show that the set of functions {f1} are linearly separable in a dimensions, then to fix some sample S of size m and some f1, and to upper-bound by b the pseudodimension of the set of functions f2 whose associated f \u20321 agrees with the labeling of f1 on S. The following definition captures precisely what we mean when we say that the function class F factors into these two other classes of functions. If f1(x) reveals too much about x, it will be difficult to prove linear separability; similarly, if f2 depends too heavily on x, it will be difficult to prove a bucket has small pseudo-dimension.\nDefinition 3.1 ((a, b)-factorable class) Consider some F = {f : X \u2192 R}. Suppose, for each f \u2208 F , there exists (f1, f2), f1 : X \u2192 Y, f2 : Y \u00d7 X \u2192 R such that f2(f1(x), x) = f(x) for every x \u2208 X . Let\nF1 = {f1 : (f1, f2) is a decomposition of some f \u2208 F}\nand F2 = {f2 : (f1, f2) is a decomposition of some f \u2208 F}.\nThe set F (a, b)-factors over Q if:\n(1) F1 is a-dimensionally linearly separable over Q \u2286 Y .\n(2) For every f1 \u2208 F1 and sample S \u2282 X of size m, the set\nF2|f1(S) = {f \u2032 2 : X \u2192 R, f \u2032 2(x) = f2(f \u2032 1(x), x)|f1(S) = f \u2032 1(S) and (f \u2032 1, f2) is a decomposition of some f \u2208 F}\nhas pseudo-dimension at most b.\nWe now give an example of a simple class which satisfies this definition. One could easily bound the pseudodimension of this example class using a direct shattering argument, but it will be instructive to work through our definition of (a, b)-separability.\nExample 3.2 Fix some set G = {g1, . . . , gk} \u2282 Rk. Suppose F = {f : f(x) = maxg\u2208Gf\u2286G g \u00b7 x} is the set of all functions which take the maximum of at most k common linear functions in a fixed set G. We will show that F (kd, O\u0303(kd))-factors over [k], where each j \u2208 [k] will represent which of the k linear functions is maximizing for a particular input. That is, for some f,Gf \u2286 G, let f1(x) = argmaxt:gt\u2208Gf gt \u00b7 x and f2(t, x) = gt \u00b7 x. Thus, we have a valid factoring:\nf2(f1(x), x) = f2(argmaxt:gt\u2208Gf gt \u00b7 x, x) = gargmaxt:gt\u2208Gf gt\u00b7x \u00b7 x = maxgt\u2208Gf gt \u00b7 x = f(x).\nIt remains to show that F1 is d-dimensionally linearly separable and to bound the pseudo-dimension of F2|f1 . We start with the former. Let \u03a8(x, t)t\u2032j = I[t\u2032 = t] \u00b7 xj for t\u2032 \u2208 [k], j \u2208 [d]. Then, let w f tj = I[gt \u2208 Gf ] \u00b7 gtj . The dot product will then be \u03a8(x, t) \u00b7 wf = \u2211\nt\u2032\nI[t\u2032 = t] \u00b7 I[gt\u2032 \u2208 Gf ]gt\u2032 \u00b7 x\nwhich will be maximized when t = argmaxt\u2032:gt\u2032\u2208Gf gt\u2032 \u00b7 x, or when t = f1(x). So, F1 is linearly separable in kd dimensions over [k].\nNow, fix f1 \u2208 F1; we will show the pseudo-dimension of F2|f1 is at most O\u0303(kd). For any fixed sample S = (x1, . . . , xm), f1(xt) is fixed for all t \u2208 [m], implying that the input to all f2 \u2208 F2|f1 , (f1(x\nt), xt), is fixed. Finally, by definition of f \u20322,\nf \u20322(x t) = f2(f1(x t), xt) = gf1(xt) \u00b7 x t.\nThus, for each j \u2208 [k], the subset Sj \u2286 S for which f1(xt) = j for all xt \u2208 Sj , f \u20322 is just a linear function in d dimensions of xt with coefficients gj , Thus, since linear functions in d dimensions have pseudo-dimension at most d+ 1, there are at most md+1 labelings which can be induced on Sj , and at most mk(d+1) labelings of all of S. This implies PD(F2|f1) is at most O\u0303(kd).\nWe now present the main theorem about the pseudo-dimension of classes which are (a, b)-factorable. The proof of this theorem first exploits the fact that linearly separable classes have a \u201csmall\u201d number of possible outputs for a sample of size m. Then, fixing the output of the linearly separable function, the second set of functions\u2019 pseudo-dimension is small. The proof of the theorem is relegated to the appendix due to space considerations.\nTheorem 3.3 Suppose F is (a, b)-factorable over Q. Then,\nPD(F) = O (max ((a+ b) ln(a+ b), a ln |Q|)) .\nIntuitively, when F1 is linearly separable in a dimensions, it can induce at most ma|Q|a many labelings of m samples, and fixing such a sample and its labeling, because F2 has pseudo-dimension at most b, it can induce at most mb labelings of m samples with respect to their thresholds.\nWhile the range of F1 might be all of Q, it will regularly be helpful to only need to prove linear separability of F1 only over \u201crealizable\u201d labels for particular inputs. If F1 has the property that for every input x, every f1 \u2208 F1 labels x with one of a smaller set of labels Qx ( Q, then it suffices to prove linear separability for x over Qx. The following remark makes this claim formal; its proof can be found in Section E. So, we will be able to focus on proving linear separability of F1 over a label space which depends upon the inputs x. This will be particularly useful when describing auctions in the next section, whose allocations are in certain cases highly restricted by their inputs.\nRemark 3.4 Suppose for each x \u2208 X , there exists some Qx \u2286 Q such that f1(x) \u2208 Qx \u2286 Q for all f1 \u2208 F1, and that for for each x, F1 is linearly separable in a dimensions for that x over Qx. Assume there is a subset of dimension T+ \u2286 [a] for which wf\nt\u2208T+ \u2265 0 and \u2211 t\u2208T+ w f t > 0 for all f . Suppose that for all x \u2208 X, f \u2208 F1,\nmaxy\u2208Qx \u03a8(x, y) \u00b7 w f \u2265 0. Then, F1 is linearly separable over Q in a dimensions as well."}, {"heading": "4 Consequences for Learning Simple Auctions", "text": "We now present applications of the framework provided by Theorem 3.3 to prove bounds on the pseudo-dimension for many classes of \u201csimple\u201d mechanisms. The implication is that these classes, which have been shown in many special cases to have small representation error also have have small generalization error when auctions are chosen after observing a polynomially sized sample. We now describe how one can translate a class of auctions into a class of functions which has an obvious and useful factorization. An auction A : Vn \u2192 [n]k \u00d7 [0, H ]n has two components, its allocation function A1 : Vn \u2192 [n]k and its revenue function A2 : Vn \u2192 [0, H ]n. We will abuse notation and refer to A2(v) = \u2211\niA(v)2i as the revenue function for an auction. Our goal is to bound the sample complexity of picking some high-revenue function from a class. All omitted proofs are found in Section E. For the remainder of this section we use F to represent a class of auctions, f \u2208 F to represent a particular auction, and F1,F2 to be the corresponding allocation functions and revenue functions which result from this decomposition. When F1 is linearly separable, this implies there can only be so many distinct allocations possible for a fixed set of valuation profiles S, and when F2 (fixing some allocation for S) has small pseudo-dimension, the class of auctions itself has small pseudo-dimension.\nThis \u201ctrivial\u201d decomposition of an auction\u2019s revenue function describes its revenue function as a function of both the allocation chosen by f1 \u2208 F1 for v and the valuation profile v. Since A2 is a function only of v, there is clearly enough information in (f1(v),v) to compute A2(v) (one can simply ignore f1(v) and output f2(f1(v),v) = A2(v)). The reason we consider this decomposition is that fixing an allocation, revenue functions of simple auctions are generally very simple to describe as a function of the input valuation profile v. If one fixes the allocation choice for a sample S of m valuations, many auctions\u2019 classes of revenue functions are either constant functions on S which do not depend upon v at all (for example, a posted price auction for a single item offered to a single bidder earns its posted price if the item sells and 0 when the item doesn\u2019t sell, both of which are constants when the allocation is fixed) or depends only in a very mild way (for example, a second-price single-item auction with a reserve earns the maximum of its reserve and the second-highest bid when the item sells and 0 when it doesn\u2019t).\nMost of the \u201csimple\u201d auctions with multiple buyers and items that have been considered are sequential auctions which interact with buyers \u201cone at a time\u201d: first, bidder 1 is offered a menu of several possible allocations at different prices, she chooses some bundle, then bidder 2 is offered one of several allocations of the remaining items, and so on. We assume for the remainder of the paper that there are no ties, (that is, there are no menus or bidders for which |argmaxBu(B)| > 1.\n6 These auctions are simple enough that they can actually be run in practice, and yet expressive enough that in many cases can earn constant fractions of the optimal revenue.\nWe next work toward a general reduction, from bounding the sample complexity of sequential auctions (with multiple buyers) to that of single-buyer problems. The following definition captures two particularly common forms of these auctions. The first definition captures the setting where the function selecting the menu to bidder i may depend upon i\u2019s identity; the second refers to when the menu is anonymous: what may be offered to bidder i can be different than what is offered to bidder i\u2032, but only due to the differences in bids vi, vi\u2032 and the remaining available items Xi(v), Xi\u2032 (v).\nFor example, consider a single item for sale. Suppose n buyers are approached in some fixed order and bidder i is offered the item at price pi if no earlier buyer has purchased the item. If pi = pi\u2032 for all i, i\u2032 \u2208 [n], then the auction applied to each buyer is the same, and we say this auction applies an n-wise repeated allocation associated with a single posted price. If pi 6= pi\u2032 for some i, i\u2032 \u2208 [n], then the allocation function applied to each bidder is an allocation rule associated with some single posted price, though the particular posted price and therefore the allocation function varies from bidder to bidder; this auction\u2019s allocation is therefore an n-wise sequential allocation drawn from the class of posted prices.\n6We elide further discussion on this technical point, though we note it is possible to encode a tie-breaking rule over utility-maximizing bundles in a way which is linearly separable (see Hsu et al. (2016) for more details).\nFor a slightly more complex example, consider a set of k heterogeneous items [k] for sale to n bidders. Consider an auction which sets a price pij for each item j \u2208 [k] and each bidder i \u2208 [n], and serves bidders in some fixed order. Bidder i is offered any bundle B for which no item has been selected by some previous bidder at price pi(B) = \u2211\nj\u2208B pij . This allocation is reached by applying a posted item pricing allocation to each buyer in turn, so these allocations are n-wise sequential allocations drawn from posted item pricing allocations. If pij = pi\u2032j for all j \u2208 [k] and all i, i\u2032 \u2208 [n], then the same allocation rule is being applied to all bidders, and the overall allocation is therefore an n-wise anonymous sequential allocation rule.\nDefinition 4.1 (n-fold anonymous and nonanonymous sequential allocations) Let H be some class with h : V \u00d7 {0, 1}k \u2192 Q for all h \u2208 H and some Q \u2286 {0, 1}k. For some n functions h1, . . . , hn \u2208 H and every v \u2208 Vn, inductively define X1(v) = [k], Xi(v) = Xi\u22121(v) \\ hi\u22121(vi\u22121, Xi\u22121(v)). Then, define the n-wise product function \u220f\n(h1,...,hn) to be\n\u220f\n(h1,...,hn)\n(v) = (h1(v1, X1(v)), h2(v2, X2(v)), . . . hn(vn, Xn(v))).\nThen, we call any such function an n-wise nonanonymous sequential allocation drawn from H, or n-wise sequential allocation drawn from H for short. If h1 = h2 = . . . = hn, we call \u220f\nh1,...,hn an n-wise anonymous sequential\nallocation drawn from H.\nThe sets X1, . . . , Xn correspond to the sets of remaining available items for each bidder after the previous bidders have purchased their bundles according to their allocation functions: what is remaining for bidder i is whatever bidder i \u2212 1 had available less whatever was allocated to bidder i \u2212 1. The two previous examples fit into this scenario perfectly. The per-bidder allocation functions are fixed up-front: the allocation rules brought about by (anonymous) a price for a single item or (anonymous) prices for each item. In some fixed order, the bidders are allocated according to their allocation rule run on their valuation and the remaining items, and whatever items they didn\u2019t purchase are available for the next bidder and her allocation rule. When the prices don\u2019t depend on the index i, the allocation function for each bidder is the same, so those cases correspond to n-wise anonymous sequential allocation rules.\nIn the event that some class of auctions\u2019 allocation functions F1 are made up of n-wise sequential allocations from a class H which is linearly separable, the linear separability is imparted upon F1. This intuition is made formal by the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.2 Suppose F is a class of auctions, and let F1 : Vn \u2192 Q \u2286 [n]k be their (feasible) allocation function. Suppose F1 is a set of n-wise sequential allocations from some H which is a-dimensionally linearly separable, whose dot products are upper-bounded by H . Then F1 is an-dimensionally linearly separable. Similarly, if F1 is a set of n-wise anonymous sequential allocations drawn from H which is a-dimensionally linearly separable, then F1 is also a-dimensionally linearly separable.\nRoughly speaking, this proof takes the maps guaranteed by linear separability of H and concatenates them n times, \u201cblowing up\u201d the relative importance of the earlier bidders with large coefficients.\nWe now present the three main corollaries of Theorems 3.3 and 4.2 which bound the pseudo-dimension of several auction classes of interest to the mechanism design community. In particular, we focus on \u201cgrand bundle\u201d pricings (Corollary 4.3), where each bidder in turn is offered the entire set of items [k] at some price, \u201citem pricings\u201d (Corollary 4.4), where each bidder in turn is offered all remaining items and each item j has some price for purchasing it, and \u201csecond-price item auctions with reserves\u201d (Corollary 4.5), where each bidder submits a bid for each item j, and item j is sold to the highest bidder for j at the larger of the item\u2019s reserve price and the second-highest bid for that item. Each of these auctions have two versions: the anonymous version, where the relevant design parameters are the same for all bidders, and the non-anonymous version, where those parameters can be bidder-specific. As one would suspect, anonymous pricings have fewer degrees of freedom, and have lower pseudo-dimension. More formally, the allocations which come from anonymous pricings can be formulated as n-wise repeated allocations, while we formulate non-anonymous pricings\u2019 allocations as n-wise sequential allocations (which, by Theorem 4.2 loses a factor of n in the upper bound on these classes\u2019 pseudo-dimensions). In each case, F1 will represent allocation functions: f1 \u2208 F1 corresponds to the allocation function which the auction will implement for quasilinear bidders. For every class F , we define for every auction f \u2208 F the function f2 to be the revenue function, which as a function of an\nallocation and the valuation profile outputs the revenue for that auction with that allocation for that valuation profile. The decomposition of F into F1,F2 is trivial; the work comes in showing that F1 is linearly separable and F2|f1 has small pseudo-dimensions.\nOur first two results use the framework to that grand bundle pricings and item pricings have small pseudodimension. The second case requires a more delicate treatment of the valuation profiles (buyers are now choosing arbitrary subsets of items, and will choose utility-maximizing bundles based on the per-item prices). It also requires us to consider a larger set of intermediate labels (the set of all possible allocations grows to [n]k from [n]).\nCorollary 4.3 Let F be the class of anonymous grand bundle pricings. Then,\nPD(F) = O(1)."}, {"heading": "If F is the class of non-anonymous grand bundle pricings, then", "text": "PD(F) = O(n log n).\nCorollary 4.4 Let F be the class of anonymous item pricings. Then,\nPD(F) = O ( k2 ) ."}, {"heading": "If F is the class of nonanonymous item pricings, then", "text": "PD(F) = O ( nk2 ln(n) ) .\nFinally, we present our final application of this technique, and bound the pseudo-dimension of the class of secondprice item auctions with (non-anonymous) item reserves. A result of Yao (2015) implies this class has small representation error for additive buyers; Corollary 4.5 shows it also has small generalization error. We briefly note that we have a slightly tighter bound on this class\u2019s pseudo-dimension, using a stylized argument found in Appendix D.\nCorollary 4.5 Suppose V is some set of additive valuations. Let F be the class of second-price item auctions with anonymous reserves. Then,\nPD(F) = O ( k2 ) ."}, {"heading": "If F is the class of second-price item auctions with nonanonymous reserves, then", "text": "PD(F) = O ( nk2 ln(n) ) .\nProof: We will show that for both classes, F1 is linearly separable (in k and nk dimensions, respectively). We do this by showing that the anonymous class\u2019s\u2019 allocations can be described as n-wise anonymous sequential allocations and the nonanonymous class\u2019s allocations as n-wise nonanonymous sequential allocations from some class of single-buyer allocation rules H which is k-dimensionally linearly separable. The natural candidate for H is the set of allocations defined by item pricings, which we showed in the proof of Corollary 4.4 is linearly separable in k dimensions.\nThe fact that F1\u2019s feasible allocations can be described as n-wise anonymous and nonanonymous sequential allocations over (single buyer) item pricings is not immediately obvious: a player\u2019s price for an item j is not just the item\u2019s reserve price, but the maximum of that reserve and the second-highest bid for j. Thus, a buyer maximizing her quasilinear utility with respect to her reserves would not necessarily purchase the same bundle as when facing item prices which are the larger of her reserve and the second-highest bid for the item, even if she is the highest bidder for each item. However, since the valuations are additive, i\u2217j the highest bidder for j will maximize her utility by purchasing item j if vi\u2217j (j) \u2265 pj , since vi\u2217j (j) \u2265 maxi\u2032 6=i\u2217j vi\u2032(j) implies vi\u2217j (j) \u2265 max ( pj ,maxi\u2032 6=i\u2217j vi\u2032(j) ) , and an additive bidder will buy any item j for which her value for that item is (weakly) higher than the price for that item. Thus, the utility-maximizing bundle for some i with respect to her item prices over the set of bundles for which she only wins items for which she is the highest bidder will also be utility-maximizing for an additive bidder needing to pay max(pj ,maxi\u2032 6=i\u2217j vi\u2032(j) for each j. Remark 3.4 implies that we need only show linear separability over Qv for each v \u2208 Vn, where Qv = {f1(v)|fi \u2208 F1,v \u2208 Vn} is the range that the allocation rules might have for a particular v.\nThus, since this class only sells j to the highest bidder for j, we need only show linear separability over allocations for good j is either unallocated or sold to the highest bidder for j. Thus, the allocation for each bidder i will be correctly predicted by the item pricing linear separator (over the label space which only has highest bidders winning items).\nThus, by Theorem 4.2, the second-price item auctions with anonymous item reserves is linearly separable in k+1 dimensions, and with nonanonymous reserves in n(k + 1) dimensions. We will now show that for both classes, for any f \u2208 F and corresponding f1 \u2208 F1, the class F2|f1 has pseudo-dimension O\u0303(k) and O\u0303(nk), respectively.\nFirst, fix F to be the set of the second-price item auctions with anonymous item reserves and pick some f1 \u2208 F1. Then, for each f \u20322 \u2208 F2|f1 and each v t \u2208 S, we have\nf \u20322(v t) = f2(f1(v\nt),vt) = \u2211\nj\nmax(pfj ,max i\u2032 6=i\u2217j vti\u2032({j})) \u00b7 f1(v t)j .\nFor each item j, suppose the relative ordering of pfj and maxi\u2032 6=i\u2217j v t i\u2032 ({j}) were fixed. Then, f \u2032 2(v t) is just a linear function in k dimensions of vt and pf , which have pseudo-dimension at most k + 1, and therefore can induce at most mk+1 labelings with respect to (r1, . . . , rm). There are m+ 1 possible relative orderings of these parameters, or (m + 1)k for all items simultaneously. Thus, in total, there can be at most mk+1 \u00b7 (m + 1)k labelings of S with respect to (r1, . . . , rm) by F2|f1 , so PD(F2|f1) = O(k ln(k)).\nThe proof that non-anonymous item reserves has pseudo-dimension O(nk ln(nk)) is analogous, with a few small exceptions. First, we consider those pf \u2208 Rnk with a fixed ordering of (for all j \u2208 [k]) the parameters {pfij |i \u2208 [n]} and the set {vti\u2032j ({j})|t \u2208 [m]}; there are therefore ( mn n ) of these relative orderings for a fixed item, or O((mn)nk) over all items. Fixing this ordering, the revenue on each sample is again a linear function (in nk dimensions) of vt,pf for each vt. Thus, F2|f1 can induce at most m nk+1 \u00b7 (mn)nk many labelings of S w.r.t. (r1, . . . , rm), implying PD(F2|f1) = O(nk ln(nk)). Then, applying Theorem 3.3 to the two classes (which are (k, k log k)-factorable over Q \u2286 {0, 1}k, |Q| \u2264 2k and (nk, nk ln(nk))-separable over Q \u2208 [n]k) implies the pseudo-dimensions are at most O(k2) and O(nk2 ln(n)), respectively."}, {"heading": "A Open Problems", "text": "We propose the following open problems resulting from our work.\n1. Is it possible to construct \u201ccompression-style\u201d arguments which bound the pseudo-dimension of the revenue of the class of item pricings for additive bidders which are tight (giving a bound of k and nk, as in Theorem D.1, rather than k2 and nk2)?\n2. For general or even subadditive valuations, do item pricings have pseudo-dimension O(nk) or strictly larger?\n3. Is it possible to frame the allocations which result from item pricings with item-specific reserves as n-fold sequential allocation rules from some simple class, for general valuation functions? We were able to show it for additive valuations, which allowed us to use the \u201ctrick\u201d where the highest bidder for an item is willing to pay anything less than her bid for that item (independent of other prices); thus, if she\u2019s willing to pay the reserve, by virtue of being the highest bidder for the item she\u2019s willing to pay the second-highest bid as well. For more general valuations, she may or may not optimize her utility by paying some combination of item prices and second-highest bids for a bundle which was utility-optimal if she were only paying item prices.\n4. Relatedly, what is the pseudo-dimension of second-price item auctions with item-specific reserves when bidders have valuations which are more general than additive or unit-demand? One can use a proof similar to the proof of Theorem D.1 to achieve a bound for unit-demand bidders, but what about for submodular or subadditive bidders? It isn\u2019t clear that the relative ordering of a small number of \u201crelevant\u201d parameters (such as per-item price and per-bidder single-item values) of the auction and sample are sufficient to fix the most-preferred bundle for each agent from a sample."}, {"heading": "B Binary Labeled Learning", "text": "Suppose there is some domain V , and let c be some unknown target function c : V \u2192 {0, 1}, and some unknown distribution D over V .

The distributionindependent sample complexity of learning c depends fundamentally on the \u201ccomplexity\u201d of the set of binary functions F from which we are choosing c\u0302. We review two standard complexity measures next.\nLet N be a set of m samples from V . The set N is said to be shattered by F if, for every subset T \u2286 N , there is some cT \u2208 F such that cT (v) = 1 if v \u2208 T and cT (v\u2032) = 0 if v\u2032 /\u2208 T .

Then, there exists some nonanonymous item pricing p \u2208 Rkn such that\nREV(p,D) \u2265 1\n10.67 REV(OPT).\nFor a single item-independent additive buyer, the better of the best item pricing and grand bundle pricing also earns a constant fraction of optimal revenue for that setting (Babaioff et al., 2014).\nTheorem C.2 [Babaioff et al. (2014)] Suppose there is a single buyer which has an additive valuation vi \u223c Di = (Di1 \u00d7 . . .\u00d7Dik).

When combined with the aforementioned result for a single additive bidder, this implies that the best of second price item auctions with the best individualized item reserves and second price grand bundle auctions with the best individualized bundle reserve, is also approximately revenue-optimal for n (non-identically distributed) buyers with valuations which are independent across items.\nTheorem C.3 [Applying Yao (2015) to Babaioff et al. (2014)] Suppose each buyer i \u2208 [n] has an additive valuation vi \u223c Di = (Di1 \u00d7 . . .\u00d7Dik). Let sp for p \u2208 Rkn represent the second-price item auction with reserve pij for buyer i\nand item j (and similarly, let sq for q \u2208 Rn represent the second-price grand bundle auction with reserve qi for buyer i). Then,\nmax( max p\u2208Rkn REV(sp,Di),max q\u2208Rn\nREV(sq,Di)) \u2265 1\n8 REV(OPT,Di).\nThe final well-known result for approximately optimal Rubinstein and Weinberg (2015), \u201csimple\u201d revenue-maximizing mechanisms states that, for an appropriately generalized definition of valuations distributed \u201cindependently across items\u201d, one can approximately maximize revenue selling to a single subadditive buyer with item or grand bundle pricings. We now present the formal definition of independence they use for these more complicated valuation functions, and present their main result.\nDefinition C.4 (Rubinstein and Weinberg (2015)) A distribution D over valuation functions v : 2k \u2192 R is subadditive over independent items if:\n1. All v in the support of D are monotone; v(K \u222aK \u2032) \u2265 v(K) for all K,K \u2032.\n2. All v in the support of D are subadditive: v(K \u222aK \u2032) \u2264 v(K) + v(K \u2032) for all K,K \u2032.\n3. All v in the support of D exhibit no externalities: there exists some D~x over Rk and a function V such that D is a distribution that samples ~x \u223c D~x and outputs v such that v(K) = V ({x\u03ba}\u03ba\u2208K ,K) for all K .\n4.

Fix some sample S = (v1, . . . ,vm) where vt \u2208 Vn and (r1, . . . , rm) \u2208 Rm.\nThis can be encoded in {0, 1}2k for anonymous item reserves (a bit for whether or not an item is sold at its reserve and another for whether it is sold for its second-price), and {0, 1}2nk for nonanonymous reserves (where each item is labeled as being allocated to some bidder, along with whether it is sold for that bidder\u2019s item-specific reserve or the second-highest bid). In the latter case, there is a post-processing rule which can reduce the label space to have size O(n2k), since all allocations are feasible allocations. In both cases, we will use yt to denote the intermediate label for sample vt.\nWe begin with anonymous item reserves. Since buyers are additive, we can consider each item separately. We consider item j \u2208 [k]. There are 2m+ 1 relevant quantities which affect the revenue any reserve achieves for item j:\npj , the reserve for j, and for each t \u2208 [m], vti\u2217j ({j}) and v t i\u2032j ({j}), where i\u2217j , i \u2032 j are the first and second highest bidders for j from sample t, respectively. When pj \u2264 vti\u2032j ({j}), let y t j = 1 and y t k+j = 0, when v t i\u2217j ({j}) \u2265 pj > vti\u2032j ({j}), let ytj = 0 and y t k+j = 1, and when pj > v t i\u2217j ({j}), let ytj = y t n+j = 0. Thus, when the relative ordering of these 2m+ 1 parameters is fixed, the jth and n+ jth coordinates for all m samples are fixed. Varying pj can induce at most 2m+2 distinct labelings of all of S. Thus, for all k items, there are at most (2m+ 2)k distinct vectors (y1, . . . , yt).\nNow, fix some intermediate labeling (y1, . . . , ym) of S. Then, the revenue for a particular reserve vector (p1, . . . , pk) which induces this labeling on the sample is easy to describe as a linear of this labeling. Namely,\nrev(vt,p, yt) = \u2211\nj:ytj=1\nvti\u2032j ({j}) + \u2211\nj:ytn+j=1\npj\nwhich is a linear function in 2k dimensions of p and vt, yt (which are constants). Thus, since linear functions in 2k dimensions have VC-dimension 2k + 1, the item reserves which agree with (y1, . . . , ym) can induce at most m2k+1 labelings of S with respect to (r1, . . . , rm). Thus, the set of all item reserves can induce at most m2k+1 \u00b7 (2m+ 2)k labelings with respect to (r1, . . . , rm), so if S is shatterable it must be that 2m \u2264 m2k+1 \u00b7 (2m+ 2)k, or that m = O(k log k). With nonanonymous reserves, each sample will instead be given an intermediate label in {0, 1}nk+k, where there is a bit for each item/bidder pair (corresponding to whether or not that bidder wins the item and pays her individualized reserve for the item), and an additional bit for each item (corresponding to whether or not that item is sold for its second-highest bid). There are at most [n + 1]k valid labelings of a single sample (each item is sold to at most one bidder, and is either sold to her at her reserve or at the second-highest price). For m samples, for a particular item j, there are now 2m+n parameters whose ordering matters (the highest and second-highest bids and the bidder-specific reserves for that item); the bidder-specific item reserves for that item can induce at most (2m+ n)n distinct orderings of these parameters; fixing this ordering, the intermediate label is also fixed for all samples. Furthermore, once one has fixed the intermediate label for all samples, the revenues of all individualized item reserve auctions which agree with that intermediate labeling are again expressible as a linear function in 2nk dimensions. Thus, if the sample is shatterable, 2m \u2264 (2m+ n)nk \u00b7m2nk, implying m = O(nk ln(nk))."}, {"heading": "E Omitted Proofs", "text": "Proof of Remark 3.4: For each x \u2208 X, y \u2208 Qx, there exists \u03a8(x, y) and for f \u2208 F1, some wf \u2208 Rd such that\nargmaxy\u2208Qx\u03a8(x, y) \u00b7 w f = f(x).\nWe simply must extend the definition of \u03a8(x, y) to be defined over all y \u2208 Q\n\u03a8(x, y\u2032) \u00b7 wf < max y\u2208Qx \u03a8(x, y) \u00b7 wf\nfor y\u2032 \u2208 Q\\Qx.

We first claim that, since F1 is a-dimensionally linearly separable, F1 can label S in at most ( m a )\n\u00b7 |Q|a distinct ways. Theorem 2.5 implies that F1 must admit a compression scheme compress, decompress of size at most a. Let f1(S) denote the labeling of all of S by some fixed f1 \u2208 F1. Then, F1 can label S in at most |rangef1\u2208F1(decompress \u25e6 compress)(S, f1(S))| ways since this is a compression scheme for F1. The decompression function takes as input a labeled examples which are a subset of S, so it will have one of (\nm a\n)\n\u00b7 |Q|a inputs for a fixed set S (some subset of S labeled in some arbitrary way), and therefore at most that many outputs, which upper-bounds the total number of possible labelings of S by the same quantity.\nThen, fixing the labeling of S to be consistent with some f1 \u2208 F1, we know that the pseudo-dimension of F2|f1 is at most b, so it can induce at most mb many labelings of S according to r. Thus, there are at most ma|Q|amb binary\nlabelings of S with respect to r over all of F2 (and, therefore over all of F ). If S is shatterable, it must be that\n2m \u2264 ma|Q|amb\nimplying m \u2264 (a+ b) ln(m) + a ln |Q|, as desired.\nProof of Theorem 4.2: In either case, Q is a set of feasible allocations, so we only must show linear separability over the set of feasible allocations (that is, we need only show separability over labels B : Bi \u2229Bj = \u2205).\nWe start with the first case of sequential allocations. We will show that F1 is an-dimensionally linearly separable. By definition, F1 is a set of n-wise sequential allocations from some H which is a-dimensionally linearly separable over {0, 1}k. This means there exists some \u03a8 : (V \u00d7 {0, 1}k) \u00d7 {0, 1}k \u2192 Ra, wh \u2208 Rd such that argmaxB\u03a8((v,X), B) \u00b7 w\nh = h(v,X) for all h \u2208 H, (v,X) \u2208 V \u00d7 {0, 1}k. We simply need to construct some new \u03a8\u0302 : Vn \u00d7Q \u2192 Ran, w\u0302h1,...,hn \u2208 Ran such that\nargmax B=(B1...Bn) \u03a8\u0302(v,B) \u00b7 w\u0302h1,...,hn = (h1(v1, X1(v)), h2(v2, X2(v)), . . . , hn(vn, Xn(v))).\nDefine \u03b1i = 2iH , and define \u03a8((v,B)ij = \u03b1i \u00b7\u03a8((vi, [k] \\ \u222ai\u2032<iBi\u2032)Bi)j\nThen, for some \u220f\n(h1,...,hn) \u2208 F1, define\nw\u0302h1,...,hnij = w hi j\nNow, inspecting the dot product for some v,B we see\n\u03a8\u0302(v,B) \u00b7 w\u0302h1,...,hn = \u2211\ni\n\u03b1i\u03a8((vi, [k] \\ \u222ai\u2032<iBi\u2032),Bi) \u00b7 w hi\nwhich, by the definition of \u03b1i and the assumption that \u03a8((vi, X), B) \u00b7 wh \u2264 H for all vi, X,B, h \u2208 H implies that the maximizing label B will first pick B1 \u2286 [k] = X1(v) to maximize \u03a8((v1, X1(v)),B1) \u00b7 wh1 , then will pick B2 \u2286 [k] \\ B1 = X2(v) to maximize \u03a8((v2, X2(v)),B2) \u00b7 wh2 , and so on. Thus, F1 is an-dimensionally linearly separable.\nNow, suppose F1 is a set of n-wise repeated allocations. Since H is a-dimensionally linearly separable, we know that for all v,X,Bi, there exists \u03a8((vi, X), Bi), and for all h \u2208 H there is some wh such that\nargmaxBi\u03a8((vi, X), Bi) \u00b7 w h = h(vi, X).\nWe simply need to define some \u03a8\u0302 : Vn \u00d7Q \u2192 Ra, w\u0302h \u2208 Ra such that\nargmax B \u03a8\u0302(v,B) \u00b7 w\u0302h = (h(v1, X1(v)), h(v2, X2(v)), . . . , h(vn, Xn(v))).\nThen, define \u03a8\u0302(v,B)x = \u2211\ni\n\u03b1i \u00b7\u03a8((vi, [k] \\ \u222ai\u2032<iBi\u2032),Bi)x\nThen, for some \u220f\nh,...,h) \u2208 F1, define\nw\u0302hx = w h x\nThen, the dot product\n\u03a8(v,B) \u00b7 w\u0302h = \u2211\nx\n\u2211\ni\n\u03b1i \u00b7\u03a8((vi, [k] \\ \u222ai\u2032<iBi\u2032),Bi)x \u00b7 w h x =\n\u2211\ni\n\u03b1i \u00b7\u03a8((vi, [k] \\ \u222ai\u2032<iBi\u2032),Bi) \u00b7 w h,\nwhich by the definition of \u03b1i and the guaranteed upper bound on the dot product \u03a8 \u00b7 wh \u2264 H , we know will be maximized by first picking some B1 \u2286 [k] = X1(v) which maximizes \u03a8((v1, X1(v)),B1) \u00b7 wh, then picking B2 \u2286 X1(v) \\ h(v1, X1(v)) = X2(v) which maximizes \u03a8((v2, X2(v)), B2) \u00b7 wh, and so on. Thus, F1 is adimensionally linearly separable.\nProof of Corollary 4.3: We first prove first that for a single buyer, the grand-bundle mechanism is 2-dimensionally linearly separable over {0, 1}. Let H denote the class of single-buyer grand bundle pricings. For some h \u2208 H, we define h1 : V \u2192 {0, 1} as h1(v) = I[v \u2265 ph], where ph \u2208 R represents the price of the grand bundle under h. We will show H is 2-dimensionally linearly separable over {0, 1}. Define \u03a8(v, b) = I[b = 1](v([k]), 1) for each b \u2208 {0, 1} and wh = (1,\u2212ph). Then,\nargmaxb\u03a8(v, b) \u00b7 w h = argmaxbI[b = 1](v([k]\u2212 p f ) = I[v \u2265 ph] = f1(v)\nsince the penultimate expression is maximized by b = 1 only if v([k]) \u2265 pf . Thus, H is 2-dimensionally separable. Notice that when F is the set of anonymous grand bundle pricings, its allocation rules F1 are n-fold repeated allocations from H. Thus, by Theorem 4.2, anonymous grand bundle pricings\u2019 allocations are linearly separable in 2 dimensions. The obvious intermediate label space Q = {~0} \u222a {ei|i \u2208 [n]}, the set of standard basis vectors, contains more information than is needed to compute the revenue of these auctions. Define q(x) = I[||x|| > 0]; Observation 1 implies that F \u20321 = q \u25e6F1 is 2-dimensionally linearly separable over Q\n\u2032 = {0, 1}. Now we prove for each f1 \u2208 F \u20321 that F2|f1 has pseudo-dimension O(1). Fix some f1 \u2208 F \u2032 1. Then, we have that\nf \u20322(v) = f2(f1(v),v) = p f \u00b7 f1(v)\nso, the class F2|f1 is a class of linear functions in 1 dimensions, which have pseudo-dimension at most 2. Thus, F is (2, 2)-factorable over {0, 1}, and Theorem 3.3 implies that the pseudo-dimension of anonymous grand bundle pricings is O(1).\nSimilarly, when F is the the set of non-anonymous grand bundle pricings, F1 are n-fold sequential allocations from H. Thus, these allocation rules are 2n-dimensionally linearly separable, respectively. In this case, we leave the intermediate label space as Q = {~0} \u222a {ei|i \u2208 [n]}. For any f \u2208 F , let pf \u2208 Rn denote the price vector for the grand bundle, that is pfi is i\u2019s price for purchasing the grand bundle. Fix some f1 \u2208 F1; we claim that F2|f1 has pseudo-dimension O(n). For any f \u2032 2 \u2208 F2 and any f which is decomposed into (f1, f2) , we have that f \u20322(v) = f2(f1(v),v) = p f \u00b7 f1(v), which again is a linear function when f1 is fixed, in this case in n dimensions. Thus, F is (2n, n)-factorable over Q, so Theorem 3.3 implies that the pseudo-dimension of nonanonymous grand bundle pricings is O(n log n).\nProof of Corollary 4.4: As in the previous proof, we claim that F1, the allocation rules of these auctions are n-wise repeated allocations and n-wise sequential allocations from the single-buyer item pricings allocation set H. We begin by showing H is k + 1-dimensionally linearly separable. For some h \u2208 H, let ph \u2208 Rn denote the item pricing faced by the single buyer. Then, define for v \u2208 V , B \u2208 {0, 1}k,\n\u03a8(v,B)j =\n{\nI[j \u2208 B] if j \u2208 [k]\nv(B) if j = k + 1\nand for h \u2208 H, define\nwhj =\n{\n\u2212phj if j \u2208 [k]\n1 if j = k + 1 .\nThen, we have that \u03a8(v,B) \u00b7 wh = v(B) \u2212 \u2211 j\u2208B p h j , which will be maximized by B which maximizes v\u2019s utility. Thus, h(v) = argmaxBv(B)\u2212 \u2211 j\u2208B p h j = argmaxB\u03a8(v,B) \u00b7 w\nh, so H is k + 1-dimensionally linearly separable. Consider F the class of anonymous item prices. Theorem 4.2 implies that this class is k+1-dimensionally linearly separable over Q = [n]k. Again, the intermediate label space suggested by this reduction to the single-buyer case, Q = [n]k, is larger than necessary to compute revenue. We define q(B)j = I[j \u2208 \u222aiBi], and by Observation 1, F \u20321 = q \u25e6 F1 is k+1-dimensionally linearly separable over Q\n\u2032 = {0, 1}k. We now show that, for a fixed f1 \u2208 F1, the class F2|f1 has pseudo-dimension O(k). Notice that for any f \u2032 2 \u2208 F2|f1 , we have that\nf \u20322(v) = f2(f1(v),v) = p f \u00b7 f1(v)\nwhich, again is a k-dimensional linear function for some fixed f1, and therefore has pseudo-dimension at most k + 1. Thus, the class F can be (k + 1, k + 1)-factored over {0, 1}k, and Thereof 3.3 implies the pseudo-dimension is thus at most O(k2).\nThe proof for the nonanonymous case is identical, with two changes. First, F1 is a set of n-wise nonanonymous sequential allocations, so it is linearly separable in n(k+1) dimensions. Second, we cannot compress the intermediate label space Q \u2282 {0, 1}nk, |Q| \u2264 [n]k, since f \u20322(v) = f2(f1(v),v) = p\nf \u00b7 f1(v) only expresses the revenue of the auction if f1(v) expresses which buyers purchase which items; thus, the set F2|f1 has pseudo-dimension at most O(nk). Thus, the class F can be (O(nk), O(nk))-factored over Q with |Q| \u2264 [n]k, and Thereof 3.3 implies the pseudo-dimension is thus at most O(nk2 ln(n))."}], "references": [{"title": "Neural Network Learning: Theoretical Foundations", "author": ["Martin Anthony", "Peter L.

(2014) show that when items\u2019 values are allowed to be correlated, for a single unit-demand bidder, the sample complexity required to compute a constant-factor approximation to the optimal auction is necessarily exponential (in m). 5For more general valuation profiles and without item-wise independence, it is known that item pricings can also achieve super-constant revenue approximations, see Balcan et al. (2008b); Chakraborty et al.", "startOffset": 19, "endOffset": 3293}, {"referenceID": 1, "context": ", 2010), a single (Babaioff et al., 2014) additive buyers, and a single subadditive buyer (Rubinstein and Weinberg, 2015).5 For the additive and subadditive buyer results, the theorems state that the better of the best item pricing and best grand bundle pricing achieve a constant factor of optimal revenue. Combining the result of Babaioff et al. (2014) and a recent result of Yao (2015), it is possible to earn a constant factor of optimal revenue for n additive buyers using the better of the best grand bundle pricing and an auction format related to item pricing (the second-price item auction with item-specific reserve prices). All n-buyer results for revenue rely on the use of nonanonymous item and grand bundle pricings. These results can be thought of as bounding the representation error of using these classes of auctions for revenue maximization; our work can be thought of as complementing these results by bounding the classes\u2019 generalization error. Item pricings are also sufficiently simple that the sample complexity of choosing welfare-optimal (Feldman et al., 2015; Hsu et al., 2016) and revenue-optimal (Balcan et al., 2008a) item pricings has been explored. Balcan et al. (2008a) study the sample complexity of anonymous item pricing for combinatorial auctions with unlimited supply and employ one technique which bears some resemblance to our framework. Fixing a sample of size m, they bound the number of distinct allocation labelings L of that sample by anonymous item pricing using a geometric interpretation of anonymous pricings. Such an argument seems difficult to extend to other classes of auctions (for example, nonanonymous item pricings). We ultimately suggest the use of linear separability as a tool to bound L, an argument which applies to many distinct classes of auctions with finite supply, and doesn\u2019t rely on the particular geometry of anonymous item pricings. We use the concept of linear separability (Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz, 2014) to prove bounds on the pseudodimension of many classes of auctions; this tool was also used by Balcan et al. (2014) in studying the sample complexity of learning the valuation function of a single buyer when goods are divisible and the valuation functions are either additive, Leontiff, or Separable Piecewise-Linear Concave; our results apply to multiple bidders, when items are 2Our framework also applies to learning simple auctions with good welfare guarantees, as in Feldman et al. (2015); all that changes is the real-valued function associated with an auction.
