Predictions of prominent AI researchers vary broadly from very pessimistic predictions of Andrew Ng to much more moderate predictions of Geoffrey Hinton and optimistic predictions of Shane Legg, DeepMind cofounder. Given huge rate of progress in recent years and this broad range of predictions of AI experts, AI safety questions are also discussed. The latter of these areas are not always completely clear, and most are quite well defined. The number of predictions, which are generally more than equal to AI security, is expected to increase over the next few years. The key question that I've found is whether or not AI is good for AI development.\n\nI have a couple of excellent theories for estimating AI performance in AI, including a prediction of global temperature. I've done a great job of finding the best estimates for global temperature, and I am confident that it will become a reality in the coming years.\nThere's a lot of noise around the world around the world. There are some obvious reasons why the US government is still working hard to improve the AI performance (that's something I am doing). I am also working with a number of global leaders to have better estimates for global temperature, but they need to take some time to do it and move quickly. This is because we need to move forward and understand how much this has to do with artificial intelligence, so it's important that those two ideas are put to use.\nA lot of people think AI is good for human intelligence, but it has been slow to be demonstrated by other large areas. I think some important issues that need to be addressed should be addressed, and I think some important areas need to be addressed.\nI'm really happy to have you guys in the audience, though, and welcome you on the show. Let me know what you think of my latest post.\nImage credit: Mark Millar/Getty Images", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 May 2016 17:49:24 GMT  (93kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04232v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 6 Dec 2016 09:29:12 GMT  (93kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04232v2", "version 2 includes grant information"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vladimir shakirov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.04232"}, "pdf": {"name": "1605.04232.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Review of state-of-the-arts in artificial intelligence with application to AI safety problem", "authors": ["Vladimir Shakirov"], "emails": ["schw90@mail.ru"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Recent progress in deep learning algorithms for artificial intelligence has raised widespread ethical concerns [1][2]. It has been argued that human-level AI isn\u2019t automatically good for humanity. It might be presumptuous and overconfident to be sure that humans would be able to control superhuman-clever AIs, that those AIs would really care about humans, for example to allow us full access to mineral resources and agriculture fields of the planet. While there are numerous advantages of having clever AIs in the short-term, the long-term danger of having too clever AIs might outweigh, leading to net negative effect of AI progress on society. The most common argument against consideration of such long-term risks is their vagueness due to supposed very long time distance from us [3].\nThe main purpose of my article is to show that superhuman level AI is reasonably possible even within next 5 to 10 years. Certainly it\u2019s very hard to predict future of science. However it\u2019s still a battle of arguments: whatever side brings more convincing arguments wins even if arguments from both sides are not very convincing leading to low margin of win (like 60%/40% instead of 99%/1%). In this article the recent progress in deep learning is reviewed. This progress has some regularities which allow to extrapolate it into the future. Such extrapolation speaks in favor of reasonably high probability of human level AI in next 5 to 10 years. So \u201dlong-term risks\u201d are quite probably not that distant and vague.\nThe most similar article has been written in 2013 by Katja Grace [4]. Another review with more details on deep history of deep learning has been written in 2014 by Ju\u0308rgen Schmidhuber [5].\nThe structure of the article is as follows. In chapters 2 - 5, I review some state-of-the-arts in natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition and reinforcement learning. In chapters 6 - 8, I answer some questions which often arise in scientific discussions about how much time we have until human level AI: unsupervised and multimodal learning, the need for embodiment. In chapters 9 and 10, I review some relevant details of the progress in neuroscience. In chapter 11, some new and prospective approaches are reviewed. Many of them might revolutionize modern deep learning but we don\u2019t know yet which ones. In chapter 12, the predictions of prominent scientists about when human level AI would be developed are discussed. In chapter 13 and 14, I make a brief review of AI safety research.\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n04 23\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 1\nM ay\n2 01"}, {"heading": "2 Natural language processing", "text": "Let\u2019s begin with some state-of-the-arts in natural language generation.\nWhy perplexity matters? If neural net says smth inconsistent (in any sense: logical, syntactic, pragmatic) then it means that it gives too much probability to some inappropriate words i.e, it\u2019s perplexity isn\u2019t optimized yet. When hierarchical neural chat bots would achieve low enough perplexity, they would likely to write coherent stories, to answer intelligibly with common sense, to reason in a consistent and logical way etc. Just as in [144] we would be able to adjust a conversational model to imitate style and opinions of a distinct person.\nWhat are reasonable predictions for perplexity improvements in the nearest future? Let\u2019s take two impressive recent works both submitted to arxiv in February 2016. They are: \u201dcontextual LSTM models for large scale NLP tasks\u201d [6] and \u201dExploring the limits of language modeling\u201d [7].\nFrom table 2, it\u2019s quite reasonable to predict that for [6] hs=4096 might give pplx<20, hs=8192 might give pplx<15 and ensemble of models with hs=8192 trained on 10B words might give perplexity well below 10. Nobody can tell now what kind of common sense reasoning would such a neural net have.\nIt\u2019s quite probable that even in this year the discussed decrease in perplexity might allow us to create neural chat bots that write reasonable stories, answer intelligibly with common sense, discuss things. All this would be just a mere consequence of low enough perplexity.\nShannon estimated lower and upper bounds of human perplexity to be 0.6 and 1.3 bits per character [38]. Strictly speaking, applying formula (17) in his work gives lower bound equal 0.648 which he rounded. Given average word length of 4.5 symbols and including spaces (as Shannon included them in his game) gives us an estimate for lower bound on human-level word perplexity as 11.8 = 20.648\u22175.5 or better to say 10 plus something. This lower bound might be much less than real human perplexity [34].\nAnother source of improvement may come from solving some discrepancy in what kind of perplexity is optimized [39] [40]. However, both KL(P||Q) and KL(Q||P) have optimum when P=Q. Also, [39] [40] propose ways to partially solve that problem using adversarial learning. \u201dGenerating sequences from continuous space\u201d[100] demonstrates impressive advantages of adversarial paradigm.\nHuman BLEU score for chinese=>english translation on MT03 dataset is 35.76 [20]. In recent article [11] neural network gets 40.06 BLEU on the same task and dataset. They took state-of-the-art [21] \u201dGroundHog\u201d network and replaced maximum likelihood estimation with their own MRT criterion, which increased BLEU from 33.2 to 40.06. Here is a quote from abstract: \u201dUnlike conventional maximum likelihood estimation, minimum risk training is capable of optimizing model parameters directly with respect to evaluation metrics\u201d. Another impressive improvement comes from improving translation with monolingual data [12]. Modern neural nets translate text \u223c1000 times faster than humans do [58]. Study of foreign languages is now of less practical use because NMT improves faster than most humans can."}, {"heading": "3 Computer vision", "text": "\u201dIdentity mappings in deep residual networks\u201d[41] reach 5.3% top-5 error in single one-crop model while human level is reported to be 5.1%[42]. In \u201ddeep residual networks\u201d [48] one-crop single model gives 6.7% but ensemble of those models with Inception gives 3.08%[66] Just to notice that 6.7 : 3.08 = 5.3 : 2.4. Another big improvement comes from \u201ddeep networks with stochastic depth\u201d[115]. There was reported \u223c 0.3% error in human annotations to ImageNet[42], so real error on ImageNet would soon become even below 2%. Human level is overcome not only in ImageNet classification task (see also an efficient implementation of 21841 classes ImageNet classification[43]) but also on boundary detection[44]. Video classification task on SPORTS-1M dataset (487 classes, 1M videos) performance improved from 63.9%[36] (2014) to 73.1%[45] (March 2015). See also [106].\nCNNs outperform humans also in terms of speed being \u223c1000x faster than human [46] (note that times there are given for batches) or even \u223c10 000x times faster after compression [47]. Video processing 24fps on AlexNet demands just 82 Gflops and GoogleNet demands 265 Gflops. Here\u2019s why. The best benchmark in[46] gives 25ms feedforward and 71ms total time for 128 pictures batch on NVIDIA Titan X (6144 Gflops), so for 24fps video real-time feedforward processing we need 6144 Gflops * 24/128 * 0.025 = 30 Gflops. If we want to learn something using backprop than we need 6144 Gflops * 24/128 * 0.071 = 82 Gflops. Same calculations for GoogleNet give 83 Gflops and 265 Gflops respectively.\nNets answer questions based on images [54]. Using similar method as in [55] the equivalent human age of net [54] can be estimated as 6.2 years old (submitted 4 Mar 2016), while [56] was 5.45 years (submitted 7 Nov 2015), [55] was 4.45 years (submitted 3 May 2015). See appendix 1 for details of age estimates. Also, nets can describe images with sentences, in some metrics even better than humans can [35]. Beside video=>text [130][126][127], there are some experiments to realize text=>picture [133][131][132]."}, {"heading": "4 Speech recognition and generation", "text": "Here, AI hasn\u2019t surpassed human level yet but it\u2019s clearly seen that we have all chances to see it in 2016. The rate of improvement is very fast. For example, Google reports it\u2019s word error rate dropped from 23% in 2013 to 8% in 2015 [67]."}, {"heading": "5 Reinforcement learning", "text": "AlphaGo and Atari agents choose one action from a finite set of possible actions. There are also articles on continuous reinforcement learning where action is a vector [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77].\nAlphaGo is a powerful AGI in it\u2019s own very simple world which is just a board with stones and a bunch of simple rules. If we improve AlphaGo with continuous reinforcement learning (and if we manage to make it work well on hard real-world tasks) than it would be real AGI in a real world. Also, we can begin with pretraining it on virtual videogames[93]. Videogames often contain even much more interesting challenges than real life gives for an average human. Millions of available books and videos contain the concentrated life experience of millions of people. While AlphaGo is a successful example of pairing modern RL with modern CNN, RL can be combined with neural chat bots and reasoners [94][95].\n6 do we have powerful unsupervised learning?\nYes, we do. DCGAN [52] generates reasonable pictures[53]. Language generation models which minimize perplexity are unsupervised and were improved very much recently (table 1). \u201dSkip-thought vectors\u201d[103] generate vector representation for sentences allowing to train linear classifiers over those vectors and their\ncosine distances to solve many supervised problems at state-of-the-art level. Generative nets gained deep new horizons at the edge of 2013-14 [78][79]. Recent work [51] continues progress in \u201dcomputer vision as inverse graphics\u201d approach."}, {"heading": "7 Is embodiment critical?", "text": "People with tetra-amelia syndrome [15] have neither hands nor legs from their birth and they still manage to get a good intelligence. For example, Hirotada Ototake [80] is a Japanese sports writer famous for his bestseller memoirs. He also worked as a school teacher. Nick Vujicic [81] has written many books, graduated from Griffith University with a Bachelor of Commerce degree, he often reads motivational lectures. Prince Randian [82] spoke Hindi, English, French, and German. Modern robots have better embodiment.\nThere are quick and good drones, there are quite impressive results in robotic grasping [17]. It\u2019s argued that embodiment might be done in virtual world of videogames[93]. Among 8 to 18-year-olds average amount of time spent with TV/computer/video games etc is 7.5 hours a day [16]. According to another study [59] UK adults spend an average an 8 hours and 40 minutes a day on media devices. Humans develop commonsense intelligence very fast. When you are 2 years old you barely can do something that current AI can\u2019t. When you\u2019re 4 years old you have common sense, you can learn from texts and conversations. However, 2 years are just 100 weeks. If we exclude sleep we get \u223c50 weeks. The 24fps video input of 50 weeks might be processed in 10 hours on pretrained AlexNet using four Titan X.\n8 do we have multimodal learning?\nYes, we do. Multimodal learning is used in [134][135][136][137] to improve video classification related tasks. Unsupervised multimodal learning is used in grounding of textual phrases in images [57] using attention-based mechanism so that different modalities supervise one another. In \u201dneural self-talk\u201d [98] a neural network sees a picture, generates questions based on it and answers those questions itself."}, {"heading": "9 Argument from neuroscience", "text": "This is a simplified view of human cortex:\nRoughly speaking [18] [19], 15% of human brain is devoted to low-level vision tasks (occipital lobe). Another 15% are devoted to image and action recognition (somewhat more than a half of temporal lobe). Another 15% are devoted to objects detection and tracking (parietal lobe). Another 15% are devoted to speech recognition and pronunciation (BAs 41,42,22,39,44, parts of 6,4,21). Another 10% are devoted to reinforcement learning (orbitofrontal cortex and part of medial prefrontal cortex). Together they represent about 70% of human brain.\nModern neural networks work at about human level for these 70% of human brain. For example, CNNs make 1.5x less mistakes than humans at ImageNet while acting about 1000x times faster than a human."}, {"heading": "9.1 Remaining 30% of human brain cortex", "text": "From the neuroscience view, human cortex has the similar structure throughout all its surface. It\u2019s just 3mm thick mash of neurons functioning on the same principles throughout all the cortex. There is likely no big difference between how prefrontal cortex works and how other parts of cortex work. There is likely no big difference in their speed of calculations, in complexity of their algorithms. It would be somewhat strange if modern deep neural networks can\u2019t solve remaining 30% in several years.\nAbout 10% are low-level motorics (BAs 6,8). Robotic hands are not very dexterous. However people having no fingers from their birth have problems with fine motorics but still develop normal intelligence [15], see also the section \u201dIs embodiment critical?\u201d. Also, one of DLPFC functions is attention which is actively used now in LSTMs.\nThe only part which still lacks near human-level performance are BAs 9,10,46,45 which constitute together only 20% of human brain cortex. These areas are responsible for complex reasoning, complex tools usage, complex language. However, \u201dA neural conversational model\u201d[22] , \u201dContextual LSTM...\u201d[6], \u201dplaying Atari with deep reinforcement learning\u201d[139], \u201dmastering the game of Go...\u201d[138] and numerous other already mentioned articles have recently begun to really attack this problem.\nThere seem to be no particular reasons to expect these 30% to be much harder than other 70%. Less than 3 years has gone from AlexNet winning ImageNet competition to surpassing human level. It\u2019s reasonable to expect the same < 3 years gap from \u201dA neural conversational model\u201d winning over Cleverbot to human-level reasoning. After all, there are much more deep learning researchers now with much more knowledge and experience, there are much more companies interested in DL.\n10 Do we know how our brain works?\nDetailed connectome deciphering has begun to really succeed recently with creation of multi-beam scanning electron microscopy [83] (Jan 2015), which allowed labs to get a grant for deciphering the detailed connectome of 1x1x1 mm3 of rat cortex [85] after the proof-of-principle deciphering of 40x40x50 mcm of brain cortex with 3x3x30 nm resolution was achieved [84](July 2015).\nWorks [87][88] show that weight symmetry is not important for backpropagation in many tasks: one may propagate errors using a fixed matrix with everything still working. This counterintuitive conclusion is a crucial step towards theoretical understanding of how brain manages to work. See also \u201dTowards Biologically Plausible Deep Learning\u201d by Y.Bengio et.al [91]. There arise some theoretic elements of how brain might perform credit assignment in deep hierarchies [89].\nRecently, STDP objective function has been proposed[86]. It\u2019s like an unsupervised objective function somewhat similar to what is used for example in word2vec. In [90] authors surveyed a space of polynomial local learning rules (learning rules in brain are supposed to be local) and found that backpropagation outperforms them. There are also online learning approaches which require no backpropagation through time, f.e.[92]. Though they can\u2019t compete with conventional deep learning, brain perhaps can use something like that given fantastic number of it\u2019s neurons and synaptic connections."}, {"heading": "11 So what separates us from human-level AI?", "text": "Recently, a flow of articles about memory networks and neural turing machines made it possible to use arbitrarily large memories while preserving reasonable number of model parameters. Hierarchical attentive memory[96] (Feb2016) allowed memory access in O(log n) complexity instead of usual O(n) operations, where n is the size of the memory. Reinforcement learning neural Turing machines[97] (May2015) allowed memory access in O(1). It\u2019s a significant step towards realizing systems like IBM Watson on completely end-to-end differentiable neural networks and in order to improve Allen AI challenge results from 60% to something way closer to 100%. One also can use bottlenecks in recurrent layers to get large memories using reasonable amount of parameters like in [7]).\nNeural programmer [104] is a neural network augmented with a set of arithmetic and logic operations. It might be first steps towards end-to-end differentiable Wolphram Alpha realized on a neural network. The \u201dlearn how to learn\u201d approach [154] [155] [156] has a great potential.\nRecently, cheap SVRG[105] was proposed (Mar2016). This line of work aims to use theoretically very much better converging gradient descent methods.\nThere are works which when succeed would allow training with immensely large hidden layers, see 6.Discussion in \u201dunitary evolution RNN\u201d[99], \u201dtensorizing neural networks\u201d[102],\u201dvirtualizing DNNs...\u201d[119].\n\u201dNet2net\u201d[117] and \u201dNetwork morphism\u201d[118] allow automatically initialize new architecture NN using weights of old architecture NN to obtain instantly the performance of latter. Collections of pretrained models are accessible online[116][121][122] etc. It\u2019s birth of module based approach to neural networks. One just downloads pretrained modules for vision, speech recognition, speech generation, reasoning, robotics etc. and fine-tunes them on final task. It might also be API services like [152].\nIt\u2019s very reasonable to include new words in a sentence vector in a deep way. However modern LSTMs update cell vector when given new word in almost shallow way. This can be solved with the help of deeptransition RNNs proposed in[124] and further elaborated in [111]. Recent successes in applying batch normalization to recurrent layers[113](Mar2016) and applying dropout to recurrent layers[114](Mar2016) might allow to train deep-transition LSTMs even more effectively. It also would help hierarchical recurrent networks like[23][126][101][127][128]. Recently, several state-of-the-arts were beaten with an algorithm that allows recurrent neural networks to learn how many computational steps to take between receiving an input and emitting an output[112](Mar2016). Ideas from residual nets would also improve performance. For example, stochastic depth neural networks[115](Mar2016) allow to increase the depth of residual networks beyond 1200 layers while getting state-of-the-art results.\nMemristors might accelerate neural networks training by several orders of magnitude and make it possible to use trillions of parameters[110]. Quantum computing promises even more[125][123]. Recently, the five qubit quantum computer was demonstrated [151] (Mar2016).\nDeep learning is easy. Deep learning is cheap. Best articles use no more than several dozens of GPU usually. For half billion dollars one can buy 64 000 NVIDIA M6000 GPUs with 24Gb RAM, \u223c7 teraflops each including processors etc. to make them work. For another half billion dollars one can prepare 2 000 highly professional researchers from those one million[129] enrollments on Andrew Ng\u2019s machine learning course on Coursera. So for a very feasible R&D budget for every big country or corporation, one gets two thousand professional AI researchers equipped with 32 best GPUs each. It\u2019s kind of investment very reasonable to expect during next years of explosive AI technologies improvement.\nThe difference between year 2011 and year 2016 is enormous. The difference between 2016 and 2021 would be even much more enormous because we have now 1-2 orders of magnitude more researchers and companies deeply interested in DL. For example, when machines would start to translate almost comparably to human professionals another billions of dollars would flow into deep learning based NLP. The same holds true for most spheres, for example drug design [153]."}, {"heading": "12 predictions for human-level AI", "text": "Andrew Ng makes very skeptical predictions: \u201dMaybe in hundreds of years, technology will advance to a point where there could be a chance of evil killer robots\u201d [32]. \u201dMay be hundreds of years from now, may be thousands of years from now - I don\u2019t know - may be there will be some AI that turn evil\u201d [3].\nGeoffrey Hinton makes a moderate prediction: \u201dI refuse to say anything beyond five years because I don\u2019t think we can see much beyond five years\u201d [31].\nShane Legg, DeepMind cofounder, used to make predictions about AGI at the end of each year, here is the last one[65]: \u201dI give it a log-normal distribution with a mean of 2028 and a mode of 2025, under the assumption that nothing crazy happens like a nuclear war. I\u2019d also like to add to this prediction that I expect to see an impressive proto-AGI within the next 8 years\u201d. Figure 2 shows the predicted log-normal distribution.\nThis prediction has been made at the end of 2011. However, it\u2019s widely held belief that progress in AI was somewhat unpredictably great after 2011 so it\u2019s very reasonable to expect that predictions didn\u2019t become to be more pessimistic. In recent 5 years there were perhaps even much more than one revolution in AI field, so it seems quite reasonable that another 5 years can make another very big difference.\nFor more predictions, see [149]. Here, I illustrated each viewpoint with the quotation of just one scientist. For each of these viewpoints, there are many AI researchers supporting it [149]. A survey of expert opinions on the future of AI in 2012/2013 [64] might also be interesting. However, most of involved people there (even among \u201dtop 100\u201d group) are not very much involved with ongoing deep learning progress. Nevertheless the predictions they make are also not too pessimistic. For this article it\u2019s quite enough that we are seriously unsure about probabilities of human level AI in next ten years."}, {"heading": "13 Would AI be dangerous? Optimistic arguments:", "text": ""}, {"heading": "13.1 the promising approach to solve/alleviate AI safety problem", "text": "We can use deep learning to teach AI our human values given some dataset of ethical problems. Given sufficiently big and broad dataset, we can get sufficiently friendly AI, at least more friendly than most humans can be. However this approach doesn\u2019t solve all problems of AI safety [160]. Apart from that we can use inverse reinforcement learning but still would need the benevolence/malevolence dataset of ethical problems to test AIs. This approach has been initially formulated in \u201dThe maverick nanny with a dopamine drip\u201d [157] but it\u2019s arguably better formulated here [158] [159] [160]."}, {"heading": "13.2 some drawbacks of the approach:", "text": "13.2.1: It\u2019s hard to create the dataset of ethical problems. There are many cultures, political parties and opinions. It\u2019s hard to create uncontroversial examples of how to behave when you are very powerful. However if we don\u2019t have such examples in the training set, there is a good chance that AI would\nmisbehave in such situations being unable to generalize well (partially because may be human morality doesn\u2019t scale well).\n13.2.2: The dopamine drip is AI subjecting people to some futuristic efficient and safe drugs making people very happy for eternity. Also, AI might improve human brains to make people even more happy. While humans often say they dislike the dopamine drip idea, they still behave in all other ways like the only thing they want is a dopamine drip. We can validate that AI doesn\u2019t insert dopamine drip electrodes in humans on some dataset of situations which are imaginable in the current world but this generalization might be not enough for future.\n13.2.3: More generally, if someone believes in a substantial probability that human morality is doomed to lead humans to the dopamine drip (or some other bad outcome) then why to accelerate that?\n13.2.4: How to guarantee it doesn\u2019t cheat us just answering our dataset questions like we want but having some deceiving hindsight in mind? That\u2019s what most of teenagers do dealing with their parents.\n13.2.5: Again, to the benevolence training dataset. Shall we legalise marijuana (and where to stop on that slippery slope to the dopamine drip?) Shall we allow suicide? It might lead to very strong suffer of friends but isn\u2019t it like unalienable right? Those are very simple questions when compared to future moral challenges. Still they are controversial and it\u2019s hard to imagine how such a dataset might be acknowledged worldwide. Is it moral to have nuke arsenal dozen of times bigger than it\u2019s enough to defend your country? Is it moral to spend trillion dollars on military issues and dozen times less on medicine R&D? Is it moral when developed countries live in luxury while people in developing countries live in poverty? Is it moral to impose your political and economical system on other countries? How can we answer such questions in our dataset when they are so hot holy-warred political issues?\n13.2.6: Evil or stupid people can use any strong AI design to make evil strong AI. As for now, almost any technology has been adapted for military purposes. Why wouldn\u2019t it happen for strong AI?\n13.2.7: If some government turns evil it can be hard to overthrow it but it\u2019s still possible. If strong AI turns evil it might be absolutely impossible to stop it. The very idea to guarantee the benevolence of super-clever being dozens and even thousands years after it\u2019s creation seems to be overly bold and self-confident.\n13.2.8: We can challenge AI to rank several solutions (already written by dataset creators) for problems in benevolence/malevolence dataset. It would be easy and fast to check. However, we also want to check the ability of AI to propose its own solutions. This is much harder problem because it requires humans for evaluation. So in intermediate steps we get smth like the CEV [162] of Amazon Mechanical Turk. The final version would be checked not by AMT but by a worldwide community including politicians, scientists etc. The very process of checking may last months if not years especially if considering inevitable hot discussions about controversial examples in the dataset. Meantime, people who don\u2019t care too much about AI safety would be able to launch their unsafe AGIs.\n13.2.9: Suppose AI thinks that *smth* is the best for humans but AI knows that most of humans would not agree with that. Is AI allowed to convince people that he is right? If yes, AI certainly would easily convince everyone. It can be very hard to construct the benevolence/malevolence dataset so good that AI wouldn\u2019t convince people in such a situation but still would be able to give the full information about other problems where it\u2019s needed as a consultant. It\u2019s another illustration of the hardness of the task. Everyone of dataset creators would disagree on how much it\u2019s allowed for AI to convince people.

It has a unique memory. A student forgets all the stuff very quickly after exams. AI just saves its configuration just before exams and loads it again when it\u2019s needed to solve similar tasks. Modern CNNs do not only recognize images better than human but also make it several orders of magnitude faster. The same holds true for LSTMs in translation, natural language generation etc. Given all aforementioned advantages, AI would quickly learn all literature and video courses on psychology, would chat with thousands of people simultaneously and so would become great psychologist.

If it likes us it might decide to insert electrodes in our brains giving us the utmost pleasure but no motivation of doing something.

Mistakes are almost inevitable when trying to partially hardcode something which is many orders of magnitude smarter and more powerful than you.\nThere is nothing but vague intuition behind thought that superhuman-level AI would take care of us. There are no physical laws for it to have a special interest in people, in sharing oil/fields/etc resources with us.

However there are prominent AI scientists who claim that human level AI is quite probable in next 5 to 10 years. So it\u2019s a good idea to argue using numbers and not just expert opinions. I\u2019d like to see some paper similar to mine but coming to different conclusion.\nAs for AI friendliness problem, there is a good approach to solve it based on benevolence/malevolence dataset. However, it\u2019s still just a raw solution which has hard problems in it\u2019s realization and with no strict proof of safety.

The results are: age 3-4, 15.3%; age 5-8, 39.7%; age 9-12, 28.4%; age 13-17, 11.2%; age 18+, 5.5%. The sum equals 100% however 18+ humans answer 83.3% correctly. We could estimate that 8 year model must answer understandable for age 8 15.3%+39.7%=55% questions with 83.3% accuracy and other 45% with accuracy equal to baseline model. If they select the most popular answer for each question type, they get 36.18%. It\u2019s reasonable to estimate the age of that baseline model as 0 years because it\u2019s not real knowledge but it depends on this distinct dataset statistics. However, there are two baseline models in article, with 36.18% and 40.61% accuracy, both are quite simple. Which one to choose? Let\u2019s calculate. Let\u2019s define accuracy of 8 year old model as y, accuracy of 4 year old model as x, baseline accuracy as t. We have following equations: 4+4*(54.06-x)/(y-x)=4.45 55*0.833+45*t=y 15.3*0.833+84.7*t=x with solution: t = 46.86%, x = 52.4%, y = 66.9%. So we estimate age of model with 57.6% accuracy as 4+4*(57.6-52.4)/(66.9-52.4)=5.45 years.
