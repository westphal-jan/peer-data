In historical linguistics, identification of cognates is an important step for positing relationships between languages. Historical linguists apply the comparative method (Trask, 1996) for positing relationships between languages.\nIn NLP, automatic identification of cognates is associated with the task of determining if two words are descended from a common ancestor or not. There are at least two ways to achieve automatic identification of cognates.\nOne way is to modify a well-known string alignment technique such as Longest Common Subsequence or Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970) to weigh the alignments differentially (Kondrak, 2001; List, 2012). The weights are determined through the linguistic knowledge of the sound changes that occurred in the language family.\nThe second approach employs a machine learning perspective that is widely employed in NLP. The cognate identification is achieved by training a linear classifier or a sequence labeler on a set of labeled positive and negative examples; and then employ the trained classifier to classify new word\npairs. The features for a classifier consist of word similarity measures based on number of shared bigrams, edit distance, and longest common subsequence (Hauer and Kondrak, 2011; Inkpen et al., 2005).\nThe above procedures provide an estimate of the similarity between a pair of words and cannot directly be used to infer a phylogeny based on models of trait evolution. The pairwise judgments have to be converted into multiple cognate judgments so that the multiple judgments can be supplied to a automatic tree building program for inferring a phylogeny for the languages under study.\nIt has to be noted that the Indo-European dating studies (Bouckaert et al., 2012; Chang et al., 2015) employ human expert cognacy judgments for inferring phylogeny and dates of a very well-studied language family. Hence, there is a need for developing automated cognate identification methods that can be applied to under-studied languages of the world."}, {"heading": "2 Related work", "text": "The earlier computational effort of (Ja\u0308ger, 2013; Rama et al., 2013) employs Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to compute transition matrices between sounds. Both Ja\u0308ger (2013) and Rama et al. (2013) employ undirectional sound correspondence based scorer to compute word similarity. The general approach is to align word pairs using vanilla edit distance and impose a cutoff to extract potential cognate pairs. The aligned sound symbols are then employed to compute the PMI scoring matrix that is used to realign the pairs. The PMI scoring matrix is recounted from the realigned pairs. This procedure is repeated until convergence.\nJa\u0308ger (2013) imposes an additional cutoff based on the PMI scoring matrix. Further, Ja\u0308ger (2013)\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n05 17\n2v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\nJ ul\n2 01\n6\nalso employs the PMI scoring matrix to infer family trees for new language families and compares those trees with the expert trees given in Glottolog (Nordhoff and Hammarstro\u0308m, 2011). Rama et al. (2013) take a slightly different approach, in that, the authors compute a PMI matrix independently for each language family and evaluate its performance at the task of pair-wise cognate identification. In this work, we also compare the convolutional networks against PMI based binary classifier.\nPrevious works of cognate identification such as (Bergsma and Kondrak, 2007; Inkpen et al., 2005) supply string similarity measures as features for training different classifiers such as decision trees, maximum-entropy, and SVMs for the purpose of determining if a given word pair is cognate or not.\nIn another line of work, List (2012) employs a transition matrix derived from historical linguistic knowledge to align and score word pairs. This approach is algorithmically similar to that of Kondrak (2000) who employs articulation motivated weights to score a sound transition matrix. The weighted sound transition matrix is used to score a word pair.\nThe work of List (2012) known as Sound-Class Phonetic Alignment (SCA) approach reduces the phonemes to historical linguistic motivated sound classes such that transitions between some classes are less penalized than transitions between the rest of the classes. For example, the probability of velars transitioning to palatals is a wellattested sound change across the world. The SCA approach employs a weighted directed graph to model directionality and proportionality of sound changes between sound classes. For example, a direct change between velars and dentals is unattested and would get a zero weight. Both Kondrak (2000) and List (2012) set the weights and directions in the sound transition graph to suit the reality of sound change.\nAll the above outlined approaches employ a scoring matrix that is derived automatically or manually; or, employ a SVM to train form similarity based features for the purpose of cognate identification."}, {"heading": "3 Convolutional networks", "text": "This article is the first to apply convolutional networks (ConvNets) to phonemes by treating each phoneme as a vector of binary valued phonetic\nfeatures. This approach has the advantage that it does not require explicit feature engineering, alignments, and a sound transition matrix. The approach requires cognacy statements and phonetic descriptions of sounds used to transcribe the words. The cognacy statements can be obtained from etymological dictionaries and the quality of the phonemes can be obtained from Ladefoged and Maddieson (1998).\nCollobert et al. (2011) proposed ConvNets for NLP tasks in 2011 and were since applied for sentence classification (Kim, 2014; Johnson and Zhang, 2015; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015), part-of-speech tagging (Santos and Zadrozny, 2014), and information retrieval (Shen et al., 2014).\nKim (2014) applied convolutional networks to pre-trained word embeddings in a sentence for the task of sentence classification. Johnson and Zhang (2015) train their convolutional network from scratch by using a one-hot vector for each word. The authors show that their convolutional network performs better than a SVM classifier trained on bag-of-words features. Santos and Zadrozny (2014) use character embeddings to train their POS-tagger. The authors find that the POS-tagger performs better than the accuracies reported in (Manning, 2011).\nIn a recent work, Zhang et al. (2015) treat documents as a sequence of characters and transform each document into a sequence of one-hot character vectors. The authors designed and trained two 9-layer convolutional networks for the purpose of sentiment classification. The authors report competitive or state-of-the art performance on a wide range of benchmark sentiment classification datasets."}, {"heading": "4 Character convolutional networks", "text": "Chopra et al. (2005) extended the traditional ConvNets to classify if two images belong to the same person. These ConvNets are known as Siamese Networks (inspired from Siamese twins) and share weights for independent but identical layers of convolutional networks. Siamese networks and their variants have been employed for identifying if two images are from the same person or different persons (Zagoruyko and Komodakis, 2015); and for recognizing if two speech segments belong to the same word class (Kamper et al., 2015)."}, {"heading": "4.1 Word as image", "text": "Historical linguists perform cognate identification based on regular correspondences which are described as changes in phonetic features of phonemes. For instance, Grimm\u2019s law bh \u223c b is described as loss of aspiration; p \u223c f is described as change from plosives to fricatives; and devoicing d \u223c t in English ten \u223c Latin decem.\nLearning criteria for cognacy through phonetic features from a set of training examples implies that there is no need for explicit alignment and design/learning of sound scoring matrices. In this article, we represent each phoneme as a binaryvalued vector of phonetic features and then perform convolution on the two-dimensional matrix."}, {"heading": "4.2 Siamese network", "text": "Intuitively, a network should learn a similarity function such that words that diverged due to accountable sound shifts are placed close to one another than two words that are not cognates. And, Siamese networks are suitable for this task since, they learn a similarity function that has a higher similarity between cognates as compared to noncognates. The weight tying ensures that two cognate words sharing similar phonetic features in a local context tend to be get higher weights than words that are not cognate."}, {"heading": "4.3 Phoneme vectorization", "text": "In this article, we work with the ASJP alphabet (Brown et al., 2013). The ASJP alphabet is coarser than IPA but is designed with the aim to capture highly frequent sounds in the world\u2019s languages. The ASJP database has word lists for 60% of the world\u2019s languages but only has cognate judgments for some selected families (Wichmann and Holman, 2013).\nWe composed a binary vector for each phoneme based on the description given in table 1. In total, there are 16 binary valued features. We also reduced all vowels to a single vowel that has a value of 1 for voicing feature and 0 for the rest of the features. The main motivation for such decision is that vowels are diachronically unstable than consonants (Kessler, 2007).\nA word such as \u201cfat\u201d would be represented as 3\u00d716 matrix where each column provides a binary value for the phonetic feature (cf. table 2)."}, {"heading": "4.4 ConvNet Models", "text": "In this subsection, we describe the ConvNet models used in our experiments.\nSiamese ConvNet Siamese networks takes a pair of inputs and minimizes the distance between the output representations. Each branch of the Siamese network is composed of a convolutional network. The Euclidean distance D between the representations of each branch is then used to train a contrastive-loss function yD+(1\u2212 y)max{0,m \u2212 D} where m is the margin and y is the true label. We only describe the architecture since this forms the basis for the rest of our experiments with Siamese architectures.1\nManhattan Siamese ConvNet The second ConvNet is also a Siamese network where the Euclidean distance is replaced by a element-wise absolute difference layer followed by a fully con-\n1The results were slightly better than a majority class classifier and were not reported in the article\nnected layer (cf. figure 1). To the best of our knowledge, only Zagoruyko and Komodakis (2015) added two fully connected layers to the concatenated outputs of the Siamese network and trained a system that predicts if two image patches belong to the same image or different images. We refer this architecture as a Manhattan Siamese ConvNet due to the difference layer\u2019s similarity to Manhattan distance.\n2-channel Convnet Until now, each word is treated as a separate input. Zagoruyko and Komodakis (2015) introduced a 2-channel architecture which treats a pair of image patches as a 2-channel image. This can also be applied to words. The 2-channel ConvNet has two convolutional layers, a maxpooling layer, and a fully connected layer with 8 units.\nThe number of feature maps in each convolutional layer is fixed at 10 with a kernel size of 2 \u00d7 3. The max-pooling layer halves the output of the previous convolutional layer. We also inserted a dropout layer with 0.5 probability (Srivastava et al., 2014) after a fully-connected layer to avoid over-fitting. The convolutional layers were trained with ReLU non-linearity.\nWe zero-padded each word to obtain a length of 10 for all the words to apply the filter equally about a word. We used adadelta optimizer (Zeiler, 2012) with learning rate of 1.0, \u03c1 = 0.95, and = 10\u22126. We fixed the mini-batch size to 128 in all our experiments. We experimented with different batch sizes ([32, 64, 128, 256]) and did not observe any significant deviation in the validation loss. Both, Manhattan and 2-stream ConvNets were trained using the log-loss function. Both our architectures are relatively shallow (3) as compared to the text classification architecture of Zhang et al. (2015). We trained all our networks using Keras (Chollet, 2015) and Theano (Bergstra et al., 2010)."}, {"heading": "5 Comparison methods", "text": "We compare the ConvNet architectures with SVM classifiers trained with different string similarities as features.\nOther sound classes/alphabets Apart from ASJP alphabet, there are two other alphabets that have been designed by historical linguists for the purpose of modeling sound change. As mentioned before, the main idea behind the design of sound classes is to discourage transitions between partic-\nular classes of sounds but allow transitions within a sound class. Dolgopolsky (1986) proposed a ten sound class system based on the empirical data of 140 languages. SCA alphabet (List, 2012) has a size of 25 and attempts to address some issues with the ASJP alphabet (lack of tones) and also extend Dolgopolsky\u2019s sound classes based on evidence from more number of languages.\nOrthographic measures as features We converted all the datasets into all the three sound classes and computed the following string similarity scores: \u2022 Edit distance. \u2022 Common number of bigrams. \u2022 Length of the longest common subsequence. \u2022 Length of longest common prefix. \u2022 Common number of trigrams. \u2022 Global alignment based on Needlman-\nWunch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970). \u2022 Local alignment score based on Smith-\nWaterman algorithm (Smith and Waterman, 1981). \u2022 Semi-global alignment score is a compromise\nbetween global and local alignments (Durbin et al., 2002).2 \u2022 Common number of skipped bigrams (XDICE). \u2022 A positional extension of XDICE known as\nXXDICE (Brew and McKelvie, 1996). Pair-wise Mutual Information (PMI) We also computed a PMI score for a pair of ASJP transcribed words using the PMI scoring matrix developed by Ja\u0308ger (2013). This system is referred to as PMI system.\nWe included length of each word and the absolute difference in length between the words as features for both the Orthographic and PMI systems. The sound class orthographic scores system attempts to combine the previous cognate identification systems developed by (Inkpen et al., 2005; Hauer and Kondrak, 2011) and the insights from applying string similarities to sound classes for language comparison (Kessler, 2007)."}, {"heading": "6 Datasets", "text": "In this section, we describe the datasets used in our experiments.\nIELex database The Indo-European Lexical 2The global, local, and alignment scores were computed\nusing LingPy library (List and Moran, 2013).\ndatabase is created by Dyen et al.

The motivation behind this experiment is to test if ConvNets can learn phonetic feature patterns across concepts. In the second experiment, we trained on the Mixed dataset but tested on the Indo-European and Austronesian datasets.

The Manhattan ConvNet performs better than PMI and orthographic models in terms of overall accuracy in all the three language families. In terms of averaged F-scores, Manhattan ConvNet performs slightly better than orthographic model and only performs worse than the other models at Austronesian language family.\nThe Manhattan ConvNet shows mixed performance at the task of cross-family cognate identification. The Manhattan ConvNet does not turn up as the best system across all the evaluation metrics in a single language family. The ConvNet performs better than PMI but is not as good as Orthographic measures at Indo-European language family. In terms of accuracies, the ConvNet comes closer to PMI than the orthographic system.\nThese experiments suggest that ConvNets can compete with a classifier trained on different orthographic measures and different sound classes. ConvNets can also compete with a data driven method like PMI which was trained in an EM-like fashion on millions of word pairs. ConvNets can certainly perform better than a classifier trained\non word similarity scores at cross-concept experiments.\nThe Orthographic system and PMI system show similar performance at the Austronesian crossconcept task. However, ConvNets do not perform as well as orthographic and PMI systems. The reason for this could be due to the differential transcriptions in the database."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusion", "text": "In this article, we explored the use of phonetic feature convolutional networks for the task of pairwise cognate identification.
