Notably, it is the first proof net calculus which does not operate by translation into some other logic, but provides proof nets for the Displacement calculus directly."}, {"heading": "2 The Displacement calculus", "text": "The presentation of the Displacement calculus closely follows the natural deduction calculus used by Morrill et al. (2011). String terms are built over a countably infinite alphabet of variables (for readability, we will often used natural language words as if they were variables), a special separator symbol \u201c1\u201d, where string concatenation is denoted by \u201c+\u201d (a binary, associative infix operator on string terms). As usual, \u01eb denotes the empty string. The sort of a string term is the number of occurrences of the separator \u201c1\u201d.\nI use lower-case roman letters p, q . . . for atomic string terms (for enhanced readability, I will often use the standard convention of using words from the lexicon in the place of such atomic string terms), lower-case roman letters a, b, . . . for string terms without separator symbols and lower-case greek letters \u03b1, \u03b2, . . . for strings containing any number of separator symbols. So the string term p+ 1+ q + 1+ r is a string of sort 2 with three atomic subterms.\nThe key to the Displacement calculus is the wrap operator \u03b1 \u00d7k \u03b2. There is some minor variation in the definition of this operator: sometimes (Morrill et al. 2011) k is either the constant \u201c>\u201d or the constant \u201c<\u201d (in which case \u03b1 is of sort greater than zero and the denotation of the term replaces respectively the first and the last occurrences of 1 in \u03b1 by \u03b2. Sometimes (Morrill 2011) k is an integer (between 1 and the sort of \u03b1) and \u03b1\u00d7k \u03b2 replaces the kth separator\nin \u03b1 by \u03b2.

The standard interpretation of the Lambek calculus connectives for string models, with \u201c+\u201d denoting concatenation, is the following.\n|A \\ C| =def {\u03b2 | \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 |A|, \u03b1+ \u03b2 \u2208 |C|}(4)\n|C / B| =def {\u03b1 | \u2200\u03b2 \u2208 |B|, \u03b1+ \u03b2 \u2208 |C|}(5)\n|A \u2022B| =def {\u03b1+ \u03b2 |\u03b1 \u2208 |A| \u2227 \u03b2 \u2208 |B|}(6)\nThe discontinuous connectives of the Displacement calculus use \u201c\u00d7k\u201d instead of \u201c+\u201d (we present only the connectives for > here).\n|A \u2193> C| =def {\u03b2 | \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 |A|, \u03b1\u00d7> \u03b2 \u2208 |C|}(7)\n|C \u2191> B| =def {\u03b1 | \u2200\u03b2 \u2208 |B|, \u03b1\u00d7> \u03b2 \u2208 |C|}(8)\n|A\u2299> B| =def {\u03b1\u00d7> \u03b2 |\u03b1 \u2208 |A| \u2227 \u03b2 \u2208 |B|}(9)\nWe can further unfold these definitions, using Definition 1 for \u201c\u00d7>\u201d to obtain.\n|A \u2193> C| =def {\u03b2 | \u2200(a+ 1+ \u03b1) \u2208 |A|, a+ \u03b2 + \u03b1 \u2208 |C|}(10)\n|C \u2191> B| =def {(a+ 1+ \u03b1) | \u2200\u03b2 \u2208 |B|, a+ \u03b2 + \u03b1 \u2208 |C|}(11)\n|A\u2299> B| =def {a+ \u03b2 + \u03b1 | (a+ 1+ \u03b1) \u2208 |A| \u2227 \u03b2 \u2208 |B|}(12)\nGiven these definitions, the meaning of A \u2193> C is defined as the set of expressions which select a circumfix A, which wraps around the string denoted by A \u2193> C to form an expression C.

The sort of a formula corresponds to the number of separators \u201c1\u201d occurring in its denotation. That is, a formula of sort n is assigned a string term of the form a0 +1+ . . .+1+ an (with all ai of sort 0 according to our notational convention). For a given grammar, its signature defines the sort of all atomic formulas occurring in the grammar. We assume throughout that the atomic formulas s , n, np, pp have sort 0 (some other atomic formulas, such as inf when used for Dutch verb clusters, have sort 1).\nTable 1 shows how to compute the sort of complex formulas. All subformulas of a formula are assigned a sort, so when we compute s(C / B) using its entry\nin Table 1 we know that s(C) \u2265 s(B), because if not, then s(C / B) would be less than zero and therefore not a valid (sub)formula (similar constraints can be derived from the other implications, eg. we can show that s(C \u2191B) \u2265 1).\nAs an example, following Morrill et al. (2011), we can assign a discontinuous lexical entry like \u201cgive the cold shoulder\u201d the lexical formula (np \\ s) \u2191> np and string term gave+ 1+ the+ cold+ shoulder (of the required sort 1)."}, {"heading": "2.2 Natural deduction rules", "text": "Figures 1 and 2 give the natural deduction rules for the Lambek calculus and for the left wrap rules respectively (the other wrap rules follow the same pattern). The left wrap rules of Figure 2 correspond rather closely to the interpretation of the formulas given in Definitions 10 to 12."}, {"heading": "3 Proof nets", "text": "One of the goals of proof search in type-logical grammars is to enumerate all possible readings for a given sentence. The bureaucratic aspects of the sequent calculus proof search make it hard to use sequent calculus directly for this goal, since sequent calculus allows a great number of inessential rule permutations. The situation for natural deduction is somewhat better, since the proof rules correspond directly to steps in meaning composition, even though there is still a large number of possible rule permutations for the \u2022E and \u2299kE rules.\nProof nets are a way of representing proofs which removes the \u201cbureaucratic\u201d aspects of sequent proofs and simplifies the product rules of Lambek calculus natural deduction. One of the open questions of Morrill (2011) is whether the Displacement calculus has a proof net calculus.\nValent\u0301\u0131n (2014) provides a translation of the Displacement calculus to a multimodal system. However, this system uses a rather large set of structural rules and these rules are defined modulo equivalence classes, which makes their use in existing multimodal theorem provers (Moot 2007) difficult. In this section, I will extend the proof net calculus for the Lambek calculus of Moot & Puite (2002) to the Displacement calculus. I will, in particular, provide an efficiently checkable correctness condition in the form of graph contractions."}, {"heading": "3.1 Links", "text": "Figures 3 and 4 show the links for Displacement calculus proof structures. Each link connects three formulas to a central node. The formulas written above the central node of a link are the premisses of the link, the formulas written below it are its conclusions. The linear order of both the premisses and the conclusions of a link is important.\nWe distinguish between par links, where the central node is filled black, and tensor links, where the central node is not filled (this is the familiar tensor/par distinction of multiplicative linear logic). Par nodes are further distinguished by an arrow pointing to the main formula of the link."}, {"heading": "3.2 Proof structures", "text": "A proof structure is a set of formulas and a set of links such that.\n1. each link instantiates one of the links shown in Figures 3 and 4 (for specific values of A, B, C and k), 2. each formula is the premiss of at most one link, 3. each formula is the conclusion of at most one link.\nFormulas which are not the premiss of any link are the conclusions of the proof structure. Formulas which are not the conclusion of any link are the hypotheses of the proof structure (the word \u201cconclusion\u201d is overloaded: we talk about conclusions of proofs, conclusions of rules, conclusions of links and conclusions of proof structures; when the intended use is clear from the context, I will often simply use the word \u201cconclusion\u201d without further qualification). The inputs of a proof structure are its hypotheses and the active conclusions of its par links (that is, the conclusions of all par links in the proof structure except, for the implications, the one with the arrow); we will call the inputs which are not hypotheses the auxiliary inputs of a proof structure.\nTo construct a proof structure for a given sequent A1, . . . , An \u22a2 C, we unfold the Ai as premisses and C as a conclusion. This will provide a proof structure with (atomic) conclusions other than C and (atomic) premisses other than the Ai. We identify these atomic hypotheses with atomic conclusions (of the same atomic formula) until we obtain a proof structure of A1, . . . , An \u22a2 C. This can fail if an atomic formula has more occurrences as a hypothesis than as a conclusion (as it should, since such sequents are underivable).\nFigure 5 gives an unfolding for the sentence \u201cMary rang everyone up\u201d, a sentence with the discontinuous idiom \u201crang up\u201d and a non-peripheral quantifier \u201ceveryone\u201d, following lexical entries of Morrill et al. (2011). Figure 6 shows (on the left of the figure) one of the possibilities for connecting the atomic formulas.\nNot all proof structures correspond to natural deduction proofs. Proof structures which correspond to natural deduction proofs are proof nets. Of course, defining proof nets this way is not very satisfactory: we want to have a condition which, given a proof structure tells us whether or not this proof structure is a proof net using only properties of the proof structure itself."}, {"heading": "3.3 Abstract Proof Structures", "text": "The general strategy we follow to define a correctness criterion for proof structures is as follows: we first simplify by removing some of the information which is irrelevant for deciding correctness to obtain abstract proof structures, then specify the correctness condition on these abstract proof structures, using a graph\ncontraction criterion, generalizing the proof nets of the Lambek calculus from Moot & Puite (2002).\nTensor trees and combs A tensor tree is a connected, acyclic set of tensor links (to be more precise, the underlying undirected graph must by acyclic and connected). A single vertex is a tensor tree. Given an (abstract) proof structure, its tensor trees are the maximal substructures which are tensor trees; this is simply the forest we obtain when we remove all par links from a proof structure. The proof structure of Figure 6 has two tensor trees.\nA comb is a link with any number of premisses and a single conclusion. None of the premisses of the comb can be identical to its conclusion. The general conditions on links prevent premisses from being connected more than once as a premiss of a comb. The premisses of combs, as links in general, are linearly ordered. Premisses of a comb can be hypotheses of the proof structure, the conclusions of a link or the special constant 1. The sort of a comb, that is the sort assigned to its conclusion, is the sum of the sorts of its premisses (the constant 1 is of sort 1). Combs play the same role as tensor trees do for Moot & Puite (2002): they allow us to go back a forth between sequents \u0393 \u22a2 C and combs with premisses \u0393 and conclusion C. Given a comb, we will refer to subsequences of its premisses as prefixes, postfixes, etc., and assign them sorts as well.\nTranslating a proof structure to an abstract proof structure To translate a proof structure P to an abstract proof structure A, we define a function, P 7\u2192 A, which replaces \u201c+\u201d links by 2-premiss combs as follows\nv3\nv1 v2\n+ v1 v2\nv3\n7\u2192\nwhich leaves all other links the same and which replaces the vertices/formulas of P as shown in Figure 7. The only slight complication is for the input formulas (lexical our auxiliary). Proof structures are defined as ways of connecting formulas, but for formulating correctness we need to know about the strings denoted by these formulas, for example, about their position relative to other formulas, separator symbols or the left/rightmost position. Another way of seeing this is that we need to replace sorted variables \u03b1 (such as those assigned to hypotheses) by variables p0 + 1+ . . .+ 1+ pn, with each pi of sort 0 (such a strategy is already implicitly used for the natural deduction rules for /I, \\I, \u2022E, \u2191k I, \u2193k I and \u2299kE, that is the natural deduction rules corresponding to the par links). As shown in Figure 7, auxiliary inputs separate the path leaving the par link by adding n new subpaths (this appears somewhat odd, but is required for the correct behaviour of the contractions when sorts are greater than 0, as we will see below). Because of the sorts of the formulas, the par links for \u2193k and \u2299k necessarily involve at least one such split, though the other par links need not."}, {"heading": "3.4 Contractions", "text": "Structural contractions Figure 8 shows the structural contractions. The \u201c+\u201d contraction composes two combs, combining the premisses by a simple left-to-right\ntraversal. It is worth mentioning some immediate corollaries of this contraction here: first, we simply eliminate trivial combs (containing a single premiss and a single conclusion, that is, when \u03b2 contains only a single premiss) when their conclusion is the premiss of another comb, and, second, the structural contractions contract tensor trees to unique combs (this is no longer guaranteed once we add the synthetic connectives, as discussed in Section 4).\nThe wrap operation \u201c\u00d7k\u201d reflects the wrap operation on strings on the level of abstract proof structures, it inserts \u03b2 at the separator indicated by k: if k is \u201c>\u201d, the \u03b11 must be of sort 0 (we replace the first separator by \u03b2) and if k is \u201c<\u201d \u03b12 must be of sort 0 (we replace the last separator by \u03b2).\nNote that \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b2 are allowed to have zero premisses.\nLogical contractions The logical contractions ensure the logical symmetry of the connectives in the calculus. Each par rule has its own contraction. The contraction for \\, shown below, essentially checks whether the string term of the premiss is equivalent to p0 + 1+ . . .+ 1+ pn + \u03b2 and withdraws the hypothesis p0 + 1 + . . . + 1 + pn (where n is the sort of the withdrawn formula in the corresponding \\I rule) to reduce to \u03b2 (the / contraction is left-right symmetric).\n... ... \u03b2\n\\\nv\n\u03b2 ...\n[\\] \u2192\nv\n\u03b31 \u03b32 ... .... . . . . .\n\u2022\nv1\n\u03b31 \u03b32 ... ...\n[\u2022] \u2192\nv2 v2\nv1\nThe contraction for \u2191k essentially checks that its auxiliary input is an infix of the appropriate sort.\n\u03b11 ...\n...\n\u03b12 ...\n\u2191k\nv\n\u03b11 ...\n1 \u03b12 ...\n[\u2191k] \u2192\nv\nDepending on k, there are restrictions of the sorts: for \u201c>\u201d, \u03b11 must be of sort 0 (that is, all premisses of the comb to the left \u03b2 are of sort 0), for \u201c<\u201d, \u03b12 must be of sort 0 (that is, all premisses of the comb to the right \u03b2 are of sort 0), for k = n, \u03b11 is a prefix of sort n\u2212 1 (that is, the sorts of the premisses of the comb to the left \u03b2 sum to n\u2212 1).\n... ...... \u03b2\n\u2193k\nv\n\u03b2 ...\n[\u2193k] \u2192\nv\nIf k is \u201c>\u201d, the premisses to the left of \u03b2 are of sort 0. If k is \u201c<\u201d, the premisses to the right of \u03b2 are of sort 0. If k = n, the premisses to the left of \u03b2 are of sort n \u2212 1. This contraction looks odd until we realize that we are dealing with a circumfix operation and that, as a consequence the subformula A of a formula A \u2193k B denotes a discontinuous circumfix with corresponding string \u03b11 + 1+ \u03b12 (look back to the introduction rule for \u2193k on the top right of Figure 2 for comparison).\nThe contraction for \u2299k generalizes the contraction for \u2022. Whereas the contraction for A \u2022 B verifies the strings of the subformulas A and B are adjacent, the contraction for A\u2299k B verifies whether the string \u03b11+1+\u03b12 of A is circumfixed around the string \u03b2 of B. The sorts of \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b2 depend on k and on the sorts of A and B, exactly as for the other rules (in the rule below, the labels \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b2 represent sequences of vertices which are premisses of the comb and conclusions of the \u2299k rule).\n... ... ... ... ...\n\u03b31 \u03b32\u03b11 \u03b2 \u03b12\n\u2299k\nv1\n\u03b31 \u03b32 ... ...\n[\u2299k] \u2192\nv2\nv1\nv2\nAs an example of how we can use the contraction criterion to verify whether a proof structure is a proof net, the abstract proof structure of Figure 6 can be contracted first by using a \u201c+\u201d and a \u201c\u00d7>\u201d contraction to produce the abstract proof structure shown on the left of Figure 9, then by performing the \u201c\u2191>\u201d and \u201c\u00d7>\u201d contractions as indicated, giving a proof of \u201cMary rang everyone up\u201d.\nBrief remarks on complexity It is easy to see the given contraction calculus is confluent and that each of the contraction steps reduces the total number of links in the structure. Therefore, even a naive implementation of this contraction calculus checks whether or not a given abstract proof structure with n links contracts to a comb in O(n3) steps, simply by repeatedly traversing the links in the graph to find contractible configurations and contracting them once they are found (we can likely improve upon this worst case, but I will leave this to further research).\nIn particular, this shows NP-completeness of the Displacement calculus. NPhardness follows from NP-completeness of the Lambek calculus (Pentus 2006) and we can show it is in NP since we can verify in polynomial time whether or not a candidate proof (that is, a proof structure) in the Displacement calculus is a proof (that is, a proof net)."}, {"heading": "3.5 Correctness of the calculus", "text": "We show that the two definitions of proof net, contractibility and corresponding to a natural deduction proof coincide, thereby establishing that the contraction criterion is correct.\nLemma 1.

Suppose a proof net has a leaf which is the main formula of its link and suppose this formula is A \u2193> C (the cases of other formulas being main formulas, and of a conclusion of the proof net being the main formula are similar).

If the last contraction is the \u2193> contraction, our proof net and contraction sequence look as follows.\nA\u0393\nC\n\u2193>\nC \u2193> A \u2206\nD\na 1 ... \u03b1\n\u2193>\nD\na ... ... \u03b3 \u03b1\n\u2193>\nD\n\u03c1 \u2740 7\u2192 [\u2193>]\u2192\nD\n...\n\u03b3\nThe initial proof structure is shown above of the left and its corresponding abstract proof structure to its immediate right (note that vertex A has been replaced by a+1+\u03b1, since it is an auxiliary input, corresponding to a withdrawn hypothesis in the natural deduction proof). The reduction sequence is of the form \u03c1, followed by the \u2193> contraction, possibly followed by a number of structural contractions (not displayed in the figure above).\nWhen we remove the par link from the figure above, we are in the following situation. All contractions from \u03c1 are either fully in the abstract proof structure shown below at the top of the picture or fully in the abstract proof structure shown below at the bottom of the picture, so \u03c1 splits naturally in \u03c11 and \u03c12.\nA\u0393\nC\nC \u2193> A \u2206\nD\nC\na 1 ... \u03b1\nD\nC\na ... ... \u03b3 \u03b1\nD\n\u03c11 \u2740\n\u03c12 \u2740 7\u2192\n7\u2192\n... \u03b3 ... \u03b3\nWe need to show that \u0393,\u2206 \u22a2 \u03b4 : D (where \u03b4 : D is the comb). Since we have two proof nets with strictly shorter sequences of contractions, we can apply the induction hypothesis for proofs \u03c01 of a+1+\u03b1 : A,\u0393 \u22a2 a+\u03b3+\u03b1 : C and \u03c02 of \u03b3 : C \u2193> A,\u2206 \u22a2 \u03b4 : D. We can combine these two proofs into a proof of \u0393,\u2206 \u22a2 \u03b4 : D as follows.\n[a+1+\u03b1 : A]i \u0393.... \u03c01 a+\u03b3+\u03b1 : C\n\u03b3 : C \u2193> A \u2193> Ii\n\u2206 .... \u03c02\n\u03b4 : D\nThe other cases are similar and easily verified. \u2293\u2294\nTheorem 1. A proof structure is a proof net iff its abstract proof structure contracts to a comb.\nProof Immediate from Lemma 1 and Lemma 2. \u2293\u2294"}, {"heading": "4 Extension to Other Connectives", "text": "One of the benefits of the current calculus is that it extends easily to other connectives, such as the unary/bracket connectives of Morrill (2011, Chapter 5) (although incorporating the treatment of parasitic gapping of Section 5.5 would require a considerable complication of the proof theory).\nThe synthetic connectives of Morrill et al. (2011) require us to extend our methodology somewhat: as currently formulated the proof net calculus produces a single comb for each proof net. When adding the synthetic connectives, we can introduce a separation marker in a way which is only partially specified by the premiss of the rule. For example, the denotation of (leftmost) split A\u030c, shown below, is the set of strings obtained by inserting a separator symbol at any place before other separator symbols (if any), and therefore the introduction rule for this connective doesn\u2019t produce a unique string term.\n| A\u030c| =def {a+ 1+ \u03b1 | a+ \u03b1 \u2208 |A|}(13)\n| A\u0302| =def {a+ \u03b1 | a+ 1+ \u03b1 \u2208 |A|}(14)\nThis moves us to a system where a tensor tree contracts to a set of combs (or, alternatively, a partially specified comb). Apart from this, it is not hard to add links and contractions for the synthetic connectives. For example, the contraction for \u02c7 can be obtained from the contraction for \u2191k by removing the links to the auxiliary hypothesis: instead of replacing the auxiliary hypothesis by 1 (which defines the position of the insertion point uniquely), there will be multiple, nonconfluent ways to matching the contraction and to insert the separator symbol. For lack of space, we will not develop these ideas further here."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "We have presented a proof net calculus for the Displacement calculus and shown its correctness.
