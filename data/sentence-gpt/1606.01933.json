NLI is a central problem in language understanding (Katz, 1972; Bos and Markert, 2005; Benthem, 2008; MacCartney and Manning, 2009) and recently the large SNLI corpus of 570K sentence pairs was created for this task (Bowman et al., 2015). We present a new model for NLI and leverage this corpus for comparison with prior work.\nA large body of work based on neural networks for text similarity tasks including NLI have been published in recent years (Hu et al., 2014; Rockta\u0308schel et al., 2016; Wang and Jiang, 2015; Yin et al., 2016, inter alia). The dominating trend in these models is to build complex, deep text representation models, for example, with convolutional networks (LeCun et al., 1990, CNNs henceforth) or long short-term memory networks (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997,\nLSTMs henceforth) with the goal of deeper sentence comprehension. While these approaches have yielded impressive results, they are often computationally very expensive, and result in models having millions of parameters (excluding embeddings).\nHere, we take a different approach, arguing that in many cases natural language inference does not require deep modeling of sentence structure. Mere comparison of local text substructure followed by aggregation of this information may work equally well for making global inferences. For example, consider the following sentences:\n\u2022 Bob is in his room, but because of the thunder and lightning outside, he cannot sleep.\n\u2022 Bob is awake. \u2022 It is sunny outside.\nThe first sentence is complex in structure and it is challenging to construct a compact representation that expresses its entire meaning. However, it is fairly easy to conclude that the second sentence follows from the first one, by simply aligning Bob with Bob and cannot sleep with awake and recognizing that these are synonyms. Similarly, one can conclude that It is sunny outside contradicts the first sentence, by aligning thunder and lightning with sunny and recognizing that these are most likely incompatible.\nWe leverage this intuition to build a simpler and more lightweight approach to NLI within a neural framework that with considerably fewer parameters outperforms more complex existing neural architectures. In contrast to existing approaches, our approach only relies on alignment and is fully computationally decomposable with respect to the input text.\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n01 93\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 6\nJ un\n2 01\nH ( )+ +\u2026+=y\u0302\nin the\npark alice plays\nso m\neo ne\npl ay\nin g\nm us\nic\nou ts\nid e\nflute a solo G ( , )\nG ( , )\npark outside\nalice someone\nflute+ solo music\n\u2026\nG ( , )=\n=\n= flute music F ( , )\nFigure 1: Pictoral overview of the approach, showing the Attend (left), Compare (center) and Aggregate (right) steps.\nAn overview of our approach is given in Figure 1. Given two sentences, where each word is represented by an embedding vector, we first create a soft alignment matrix using neural attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015). We then use the (soft) alignment to decompose the task into subproblems that can are solved separately. Finally, the results of these subproblems are merged to produce the final classification. In addition, we optionally apply intra-sentence attention (Cheng et al., 2016) to endow the model with a richer encoding of substructures prior to the alignment step.\nAsymptotically our approach does the same total work as a vanilla LSTM encoder, while being trivially parallelizable across sentence length, which can allow for considerable speedups in low-latency settings. Empirical results on the SNLI corpus show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, while using almost an order of magnitude fewer parameters compared to complex LSTM-based approaches."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Our method is motivated by the central role played by alignment in machine translation (Koehn, 2009) and previous approaches to sentence similarity modeling (Haghighi et al., 2005; Das and Smith, 2009; Chang et al., 2010; Fader et al., 2013). The neural counterpart to alignment, attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015), which is a key part of our approach, was originally proposed and has been predominantly used in conjunction with LSTMs (Rockta\u0308schel et al., 2016; Wang and Jiang, 2015) and to a lesser extent with CNNs (Yin et al., 2016). In contrast, our use of attention is purely based on word embeddings and our method essentially consists of feed-forward networks that operate largely independently of word order."}, {"heading": "3 Approach", "text": "Let a = (a1, . . . , a`a) and b = (b1, . . . , b`b) be the two input sentences of length `a and `b, re-\nspectively. We assume that each ai, bj \u2208 Rd is a word embedding vector of dimension d and that each sentence is prepended with a \u201cNULL\u201d token. Our training data comes in the form of labeled pairs {a(n),b(n),y(n)}Nn=1, where y(n) = (y\n(n) 1 , . . . , y (n) C ) is an indicator vector encoding the label and C is the number of output classes. At test time, we receive a pair of sentences (a,b) and our goal is to predict the correct label y.\nInput representation. Let a\u0304 = (a\u03041, . . . , a\u0304`a) and b\u0304 = (b\u03041, . . . , b\u0304`b) denote the input representation of each fragment that is fed to subsequent steps of the algorithm. The vanilla version of our model simply defines a\u0304 := a and b\u0304 := b. With this input representation, our model does not make use of word order. However, we discuss an extension using intrasentence attention in Section 3.4 that uses a minimal amount of sequence information.\nThe core model consists of the following three components (see Figure 1), which are trained jointly:\nAttend. First, soft-align the elements of a\u0304 and b\u0304 using a variant of neural attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and decompose the problem into the comparison of aligned subphrases.\nCompare. Second, separately compare each aligned subphrase to produce a set of vectors {v1,i}`ai=1 for a and {v2,j} `b j=1 for b. Each v1,i is a nonlinear combination of ai and its (softly) aligned subphrase in b (and analogously for v2,i).\nAggregate. Finally, aggregate the sets {v1,i}`ai=1 and {v2,j}`bj=1 from the previous step and use the result to predict the label y\u0302."}, {"heading": "3.1 Attend", "text": "We first obtain unnormalized attention weights eij , computed by a function F \u2032, which decomposes as:\neij := F \u2032(a\u0304i, b\u0304j) := F (a\u0304i) TF (b\u0304j) . (1)\nThis decomposition avoids the quadratic complexity that would be associated with separately applying F \u2032 `a \u00d7 `b times. Instead, only `a + `b applications of F are needed. We take F to be a feed-forward neural network with ReLU activations (Glorot et al., 2011).\nThese attention weights are normalized as follows:\n\u03b2i := `b\u2211 j=1 exp(eij)\u2211`b k=1 exp(eik) b\u0304j ,\n\u03b1j := `a\u2211 i=1 exp(eij)\u2211`a k=1 exp(ekj) a\u0304i .

(3)\nwhere the brackets [\u00b7, \u00b7] denote concatenation. Note that since there are only a linear number of terms in this case, we do not need to apply a decomposition as was done in the previous step. Thus G can jointly take into account both a\u0304i, and \u03b2i."}, {"heading": "3.3 Aggregate", "text": "We now have two sets of comparison vectors {v1,i}`ai=1 and {v2,j} `b j=1. We first aggregate over each set by summation:\nv1 = `a\u2211 i=1 v1,i , v2 = `b\u2211 j=1 v2,j . (4)\nand feed the result through a final feedforward network classifier H:\ny\u0302 = H([v1,v2]) , (5)\nwhere y\u0302 \u2208 RC represents the predicted (unnormalized) scores for each class and consequently the predicted class is given by y\u0302 = argmaxiy\u0302i.\nFor training, we use multi-class cross-entropy loss with dropout regularization (Srivastava et al., 2014):\nL(\u03b8F , \u03b8G, \u03b8H) = 1\nN N\u2211 n=1 C\u2211 c=1 y(n)c log exp(y\u0302c)\u2211C c\u2032=1 exp(y\u0302c\u2032) .\nHere \u03b8F , \u03b8G, \u03b8H denote the learnable parameters of the feed-forward networks F, G and H, respectively."}, {"heading": "3.4 Intra-Sentence Attention (Optional)", "text": "In the above model, the input representations are simple word embeddings. However, we can augment this input representation with intra-sentence attention to encode compositional relationships between words within each sentence, as proposed by Cheng et al. (2016). Similar to Eqs. 1 and 2, we define\nfij := Fintra(ai) TFintra(aj) , (6)\nwhere Fintra is a feed-forward network. We then create the self-aligned phrases\na\u2032i := `a\u2211 j=1 exp(fij + di\u2212j)\u2211`a k=1 exp(fik + di\u2212j) aj . (7)\nThe distance-sensitive bias terms di\u2212j \u2208 R provides the model with a minimal amount of sequence information, while remaining parallelizable. These terms are bucketed such that all distances greater than 10 words share the same bias. The input representation for subsequent steps is then defined as a\u0304i := [ai, a\u2032i] and analogously b\u0304i := [bi, b\u2032i]."}, {"heading": "4 Computational Complexity", "text": "We now discuss the asymptotic complexity of our approach and how it offers a higher degree of parallelism than LSTM-based approaches. Recall that d denotes embedding dimension and ` means sentence length. For simplicity we assume that all hidden dimensions are d and that the complexity of matrix(d\u00d7 d)-vector(d\u00d7 1) multiplication is O(d2).\nA key assumption of our analysis is that ` < d, which we believe is reasonable and is true of the SNLI dataset (Bowman et al., 2015) where ` < 80, whereas recent LSTM-based approaches have used d \u2265 300. This assumption allows us to bound the complexity of computing the `2 attention weights.\nComplexity of LSTMs. An LSTM cell is O(d2), resulting in a complexity of O(`d2) to encode the sentence. Adding attention as in Rockta\u0308schel et al. (2016) increases this complexity to O(`d2 + `2d).\nComplexity of our Approach. Application of a feed-forward network requires O(d2) steps. Thus, the Compare and Aggregate steps have complexity O(`d2) and O(d2) respectively. For the Attend step, F is evaluated O(`) times, giving a complexity of\nO(`d2). Each attention weight eij requires one dot product, resulting in a complexity of O(`2d).\nThus the total complexity of the model is O(`d2 + `2d), which is equal to that of an LSTM with attention. However, note that with the assumption that ` < d, this becomes O(`d2) which is the same complexity as a regular LSTM. Moreover, unlike the LSTM, our approach has the advantage of being parallelizable over `, which can be useful at test time."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "We evaluate our approach on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset (Bowman et al., 2015). Given a sentences pair (a,b), the task is to predict whether b is entailed by a, b contradicts a, or whether their relationship is neutral. Following Bowman et al. (2015), we remove examples labeled \u201c\u2013\u201d (no gold label) from the dataset, which leaves 549,367 pairs for training, 9,842 for development, and 9,824 for testing. We use the tokenized sentences provided in the dataset as input to our method.\nWe use 300 dimensional GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) to represent words, projected down to 200 dimensions, a number determined via hyperparameter tuning. OOV words are hashed to one of 100 random embeddings. All embeddings remain fixed during training, but the projection matrix is trained. We additionally tuned the following hyperparameters: network size (2-layers, each with 200 neurons), batch size (4), dropout ratio (0.2) and learning rate (0.05\u2013vanilla, 0.025\u2013intra-attention), with optimal values in parentheses. The method was im-\nplemented in TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015). Each hyperparameter setting was run on a single machine with 10 asynchronous gradient-update threads, using Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) for optimization.\nResults in terms of 3-class accuracy are shown in Table 1. Our approach, which ignores word order, achieves state-of-the-art results with almost an order of magnitude fewer parameters than the LSTMN of Cheng et al. (2016). Adding intra-sentence attention gives a considerable improvement of 0.5 percentage points over the existing state of the art. Table 2 gives a breakdown of accuracy on the development set showing that most of our gains stem from neutral, while most losses come from contradiction pairs."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "We presented a simple attention-based approach to natural language inference that is trivially parallelizable. The approach outperforms considerably more complex neural methods aiming for text understanding. Our results suggest that, at least for this task, pairwise comparisons are relatively more important than global sentence-level representations."}], "references": [{"title": "TensorFlow: Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous systems", "author": ["Abadi et al.2015] Mart\u0131\u0301n Abadi", "Ashish Agarwal", "Paul Barham", "Eugene Brevdo", "Zhifeng Chen", "Craig Citro", "Greg S Corrado", "Andy Davis", "Jeffrey Dean", "Matthieu Devin"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Abadi et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Abadi et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate", "author": ["Kyunghyun Cho", "Yoshua Bengio"], "venue": "In Proceedings of ICLR", "citeRegEx": "Bahdanau et al\\.,? \\Q2015\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bahdanau et al\\.", "year": 2015}, {"title": "A brief history of natural logic.
