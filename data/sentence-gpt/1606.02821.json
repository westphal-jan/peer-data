Here we show how two different distributional measures can be used to detect two different types of semantic change. The first measure, which has been used in many previous works, analyzes global shifts in a word's distributional semantics; it is sensitive to changes due to regular processes of linguistic drift, such as the semantic generalization of promise (\"I promise.\" -&gt; \"It promised to be exciting.\"). The second measure, which we develop here, focuses on local changes to a word's nearest semantic neighbors; it is more sensitive to cultural shifts, such as the change in the meaning of cell (\"prison cell\" -&gt; \"cell phone\").

The importance of the social-cultural relations of language, culture, and language, however, is rarely questioned. In order to study the implications of a recent development in the linguistics of languages, we explored two major factors that can influence social differences: the importance of language, culture, and language-specific information. For example, the number of bilinguals in the U.S. compared to the number of foreign-born English speakers in the U.S. versus the number of native English speakers in the U.S. vs. the number of English speakers in the U.S. compared to the number of Spanish speakers in the U.S. vs. the number of Spanish speakers in the U.S. versus the number of Spanish speakers in the U.S. vs. the number of Spanish speakers in the U.S. versus the number of Spanish speakers in the U.S. vs. the number of Spanish speakers in the U.S. vs. the number of Spanish speakers in the U.S. vs. the number of Spanish speakers in the U.S. vs. the number of Spanish speakers in the U.S. vs. the number of Spanish speakers in the U.S. vs. the number of Spanish speakers in the U.S. vs. the number of Spanish", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2016 04:42:12 GMT  (578kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02821v1", "5 pages, 3 figures"], ["v2", "Sat, 24 Sep 2016 03:45:27 GMT  (603kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02821v2", "5 pages, 3 figures, EMNLP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["william l hamilton", "jure leskovec", "dan jurafsky"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.02821"}, "pdf": {"name": "1606.02821.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Cultural Shift or Linguistic Drift?

Previous work, however, does not\nconsider the underlying causes of semantic change or how to distentangle different types of change.\nWe show how two computational measures can be used to distinguish between semantic changes caused by cultural shifts (e.g., technological advancements) and those caused by more regular processes of semantic change (e.g., grammaticalization or subjectification). This distinction is essential for research on linguistic and cultural evolution. Detecting cultural shifts in language use is crucial to computational studies of history and other digital humanities projects. By contrast, for advancing historical linguistics, cultural shifts amount to noise and only the more regular shifts matter.\nOur work builds on two intuitions: that distributional models can highlight syntagmatic versus paradigmatic relations with neighboring words (Schu\u0308tze and Pedersen, 1993) and that nouns are more likely to undergo changes due to irregular cultural shifts while verbs more readily participate in regular processes of semantic change (Gentner and France, 1988; Traugott and Dasher, 2001). We use this noun vs. verb mapping as a proxy to compare our two measures\u2019 sensitivities to cultural vs. linguistic shifts. The first measure is based upon changes to a word\u2019s local semantic neighborhood; we show that it is more sensitive to changes in the nominal domain and captures changes due to unpredictable cultural shifts. Our second measure relies on a more traditional global notion of change; we show that it better captures changes, like those in verbs, that are the result of regular linguistic drift.\nOur analysis relies on a large-scale statistical study of six historical corpora in multiple lan-\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n02 82\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 9\nJ un\n2 01\nguages, along with case-studies that illustrate the fine-grained differences between the two measures."}, {"heading": "2 Methods", "text": "We use the diachronic word2vec embeddings constructed by Hamilton et al. (2016) to measure how word meanings change between consecutive decades.1 In these representations each word wi has a vector representation w(t) (Turney and Pantel, 2010) at each time point, which captures its co-occurrence statistics for that time period. The vectors are constructed using the skip-gram with negative sampling (SGNS) algorithm (Mikolov et al., 2013) and post-processed to align the semantic spaces between years. Measuring the distance between word vectors for consecutive decades allows us to compute the rate at which the different words change in meaning (Gulordava and Baroni, 2011; Hamilton et al., 2016).\nWe analyzed the decades from 1800 to 1990 using vectors derived from the Google N-gram datasets (Lin et al., 2012) that have large amounts of historical text (English, French, German, and English Fiction). We also used vectors derived from the COHA dataset, which is smaller than Google Ngrams but was carefully constructed to be genre balanced and contains word lemmas as well as surface forms (Davies, 2010). We examined all decades\n1http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/histwords/\nfrom 1850 through 2000 using the COHA dataset."}, {"heading": "2.1 Measuring semantic change", "text": "We examine two different ways to measure semantic change (Figure 1).\nGlobal measure The first measure analyzes global shifts in a word\u2019s vector semantics and is identical to the measure used in most previous works (Gulordava and Baroni, 2011; Jatowt and Duh, 2014; Kim et al., 2014; Hamilton et al., 2016). We simply take a word\u2019s vectors for two different decades and measure the cosine distance between them, i.e.\ndG(w (t) i , w (t+1) i ) = cos-dist(w (t) i ,w (t+1) i ). (1)\nLocal neighborhood measure The second measure is novel and based on the intuition that only a word\u2019s nearest semantic neighbors are relevant. For this measure, we first find word wi\u2019s set of k nearest-neighbors (according to cosine-similarity) within each decade, which we denote by the ordered set Nk(w (t) i ). Next, to measure the change between decades t and t + 1, we compute a \u201csecond-order\u201d similarity vector for w(t)i from these neighbor sets with entries defined as\ns(t)(j) = cos-sim(w(t)i ,w (t) j )\n\u2200wj \u2208 Nk(w (t) i ) \u222aNk(w (t+1) i ), (2)\nand we compute an analogous vector for w(t+1)i . Finally, we compute the local neighborhood change as\ndL(w (t) i , w (t+1) i ) = cos-dist(s (t) i , s (t+1) i ). (3)\nThis measures the extent to which wi\u2019s similarity with its nearest neighbors has changed. This measure captures strong shifts in a word\u2019s paradigmatic relations but is less sensitive to global shifts in syntagmatic contexts (Schu\u0308tze and Pedersen, 1993). We used k = 25 in all experiments (though we found the results to be consistent for k \u2208 [10, 50])."}, {"heading": "2.2 Statistical methodology", "text": "To test whether nouns or verbs change more according to our two measures of change, we follow Hamilton et al. (2016) and used a linear mixed model approach. This approach essentially amounts to a linear regression but the model also includes \u201crandom\u201d effects to account for the fact that the measurements for individual words will be correlated across time (McCulloch and Neuhaus, 2001).\nWe ran two regressions per datatset: one with the global dG values as the dependent variables (DVs) and one with the local neighborhood dL values. In both cases, we examined the change between all consecutive decades and normalized the DVs to zero-mean and unit variance. We examined nouns/verbs within the top-10000 words by frequency rank and removed all words that occurred <500 times in the smaller COHA dataset. The independent variables are word frequency, the decade of the change (represented categorically), and variable indicating whether a word is a noun or a verb (proper nouns are excluded, as in Hamilton et al., 2016).2\n2Frequency was included since it is known to strongly influ-"}, {"heading": "3 Results", "text": "Our results show that the two seemingly related measures actually result in drastically different notions of semantic change."}, {"heading": "3.1 Nouns vs. verbs", "text": "The local neighborhood measure assigns far higher rates of semantic change to nouns across all languages and datasets while the opposite is true for the global distance measure, which tends to assigns higher rates of change to verbs (Figure 2).\nWe focused on verbs vs. nouns since they are the two major parts-of-speech and previous research has shown that verbs are more semantically mutable than nouns and thus more likely to undergo linguistic drift (Gentner and France, 1988), while nouns are far more likely to change due to cultural shifts (e.g., new technologies) (Traugott and Dasher, 2001). The differences shown in Figure 2 also hold when adverbs are included along with the verbs, which fits with previous research showing that adverbs are often the target of regular linguistic changes like subjectification (ibid.)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Case studies", "text": "We examined six case-study words grouped into two sets. These case studies show that three examples of well-attested regular linguistic shifts (set A) changed more according to the global measure, while three well-known examples of cultural changes (set B) are more prevalent with the local neighborhood measure. Table 1 lists these words with some representative historical contexts (Davies, 2010).\nence the distributional measures (Hamilton et al., 2016).\nSet A contains three words that underwent attested regular linguistic shifts detailed in Traugott and Dasher (2001): actually, must, and promise. These three words represent three different types of regular linguistic shifts: actually is a classic case of subjectification (detailed in Figure 1); must shifted from a deontic/obligation usage (\u201cyou must do X\u201d) to a epistemic one (\u201cX must be the case\u201d), exemplifying a regular pattern of change common to many modal verbs; and promise represents the class of shifting \u201cperformative speech acts\u201d that undergo rich changes due to their pragmatic uses and subjectification (Traugott and Dasher, 2001). The contexts listed in Table 1 exemplify these shifts.\nSet B contains three words that were selected because they underwent well-known cultural shifts over the last 150 years: gay, virus, and cell. These words gained new meanings due to uses in community-specific vernacular (gay) or technological advances (virus, cell). The cultural shifts underlying these changes in usage \u2014 e.g., the development of the mobile \u201ccell phone\u201d \u2014 were unpredictable in the sense that they were not the result of regularities in human linguistic systems.\nFigure 3 shows how much the meaning of these word changed from the 1850s to the 1990s according\nto the two different measures on the English Google data. We see that the words in set A changed more when measurements were made using the global measure, while the opposite holds for set B."}, {"heading": "4 Discussion", "text": "Our results show that our novel local neighborhood measure of semantic change is more sensitive to changes in nouns, while the global measure is more sensitive to changes in verbs. This mapping aligns with the traditional distinction between irregular cultural shifts in nominals and more regular cases of linguistic drift (Traugott and Dasher, 2001) and is further reinforced by our six case-studies.\nThis finding emphasizes that researchers must develop and use measures of semantic change that are tuned to specific tasks. For example, a cultural change-point detection framework would be more successful using our local-neighborhood measure, while an empirical study of grammaticalization would be better off using the traditional global distance approach. Comparing measurements made by these two approaches also allows researchers to assess the extent to which semantic changes are linguistic or cultural in nature."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The authors thank C.
