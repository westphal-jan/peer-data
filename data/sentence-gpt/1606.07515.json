Sometimes distributed knowledge is referred to as the potential knowledge of a group, or the joint knowledge they could obtain if they had unlimited means of communication. In epistemic logic, the formula DG\u03d5 is intended to express the fact that group G has distributed knowledge of \u03d5 , that there is enough information in the group to infer \u03d5 . But this is not the same as reasoning about what happens if the members of the group share their information. In this paper we introduce an operator RG, such that RG\u03d5 means that \u03d5 is true after G have shared all their information with each other \u2013 after G\u2019s distributed knowledge has been resolved. The RG operators are called resolution operators. Semantically, we say that an expression RG\u03d5 is true iff \u03d5 is true in what van Benthem [11, p. 249] calls (G\u2019s) communication core; the model update obtained by removing links to states for members of G that are not linked by all members of G. We study logics with different combinations of resolution operators and operators for common and distributed knowledge. Of particular interest is the relationship between distributed and common knowledge. The main results are sound and complete axiomatizations."}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "In epistemic logic [6, 8, 5] different notions of group knowledge describe different ways in which knowledge can be associated with a group. Common knowledge is stronger than individual knowledge: that something is common knowledge requires not only that everybody in the group knows it, but that everybody knows that everybody knows it, and so on. Distributed knowledge, on the other hand, is weaker than individual knowledge: distributed knowledge is knowledge that is distributed throughout the group even if no individual knows it.\nMore concrete informal descriptions of the concept of distributed knowledge abound, but they are often inaccurate descriptions of the concept as formalized in standard epistemic logic. A misconception is that something is distributed knowledge in a group if the agents in the group could get to know it after some (perhaps unlimited) communications between them1. To see that this interpretation must be incorrect, consider the formula D{1,2}(p\u2227\u00acK1 p). In this formula, DG\u03d5 and Ki\u03d5 mean that \u03d5 is distributed knowledge in the group G, and individual knowledge of agent i, respectively. Thus, the formula says that it is distributed knowledge among agents 1 and 2 that p is true and that agent 1 does not know p. This formula is consistent (also when we assume that knowledge has the S5 properties). However, it is not possible that agents 1 and 2 both can get to know that p is true and that agent 1\n1Some examples of informal descriptions of distributed knowledge from the literature include \u201cA group has distributed knowledge of a fact \u03d5 if the knowledge of \u03d5 is distributed among its members, so that by pooling their knowledge together the members of the group can deduce \u03d5\u201d [6]; \u201c.. it should be possible for the members of the group to establish \u03d5 through communication\u201d [12, 10]; \u201c.. the knowledge that would result of the agents could somehow \u2019combine\u2019 their knowledge\u201d [12]. These descriptions can at least give a reader the impression that distributed knowledge is about internal communication in the group of agents.\ndoes not know that p is true (assuming the S5 properties of knowledge), no matter how much they communicate (or \u201cpool\u201d their knowledge). The \u201cproblem\u201d here is that in a formula DG\u03c8 , \u03c8 describes the possible states of the world as they were before any communication or other events took place, so a more accurate reading of D{1,2}(p\u2227\u00acK1 p) would perhaps be that it follows from the combination of 1 and 2\u2019s knowledge that p\u2227\u00acK1 p were true before any communication or other events took place. More technically, the \u201cproblem\u201d is due to the standard compositional semantics of modal logic: in the evaluation of DG\u03d5 , the DG operator picks out a number of states considered possible by the group G (actually the states considered possible by all members of the group), and then \u03d5 is evaluated in each of these states in the original model, without any effect of the DG operator.\nBut we don\u2019t really consider this a problem. There are other interpretations of distributed knowledge where the consistency of the mentioned formula makes perfect sense, such that distributed knowledge being the knowledge of a third party, someone \u201coutside the system\u201d who somehow has access to the epistemic states of the group members. It shows, however, that it does not make sense to interpret distributed knowledge as something that is true after the agents in the group have communicated with each other \u2013 with the standard semantics.\nIn this paper we introduce and study an alternative group modality RG, where RG\u03d5 means (roughly speaking) that \u03d5 is true after the agents in the group have shared all their information with each other. We call that resolving distributed knowledge, and the RG operators are called resolution operators.\nSemantically, we say that an expression RG\u03d5 is true iff \u03d5 is true in what van Benthem [11, p. 249] calls (G\u2019s) communication core; the model update obtained by removing links to states for members of G that are not linked by all members of G. See Fig. 1 for an illustration.\nIn this paper we capture that model transformation by the new resolution operators, and study resulting logics. For example, the formula R{1,2}(p\u2227\u00acK1 p) will be inconsistent in the resulting logics. R{1,2}(p\u2227K1 p) is true in state t in the model in Fig. 1.\nThis model transformation abstracts away from the issue of how the agents share their information; whether they communicate directly with each other and if so in which language, whether they are informed by some outsider about the information other agents have and if so how, and so on. As noted by van Benthem [11, p. 249], the communication core cannot always be obtained by public announcements using the epistemic language. Similarly, as noted by several researchers [12, 7, 10], standard distributed knowledge does not always follow logically from the knowledge of the individual agents expressible in the epistemic language. Our model, like that of standard distributed knowledge, is purely semantic: we assume that if an agent can discern between two different worlds, then there exists some mechanism that results in other members of the group being able to make the same distinction. This is further discussed Section 5.\nThis model transformation models a particular kind of internal group information sharing event. Exactly which kind depends on what we assume about what other agents, i.e., agents that are not in the group G that resolve their knowledge, know about the fact that this event is taking place. In this paper we will assume that it is common knowledge among the other agents that G resolve their knowledge \u2013 but not what the agents in G actually learn. This corresponds to a natural class of events: publicly observable private resolution of distributed knowledge. An example is a meeting in a closed room, where it is observed that a certain group meets in the room to share information.\nWe want to make it clear that we do not consider distributed knowledge with standard semantics to be \u201cwrong\u201d; the important thing is to be clear about its meaning. In particular, the resolution operators are not intended as a \u201creplacement\u201d of distributed knowledge operators, but as a complement: they express different things. The logics we study contains both types of operators, as well as common knowledge. The main results are sound and complete axiomatizations.\nTechnically, the model transformation, which amounts to removing certain edges, is similar to those found in the simplest dynamic epistemic logics [5] such as public announcement logics [9]. [11] has also pointed out the close connection between the communication core and sequences of public announcements. Public announcement logics with distributed knowledge have been studied recently [13]. In the absence of common knowledge, we get reduction axioms for public announcement logic with distributed knowledge. This turns out to be the case for resolution operators as well. It is not the case in the presence of common knowledge, however.\nThere is a close connection between the communication core and common knowledge [11]. By studying complete axiomatizations of logics with the resolution operators we make some aspects of that connection precise and give an answer to the question \u201cwhen does distributed knowledge become common knowledge?\u201d \u2013 under certain assumptions.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we review some background definitions and results from the literature, before we introduce logics with the new resolution operators in Section 3, where we also look at some properties of the operators. In Section 4 we prove completeness of resulting logics; the most interesting case being epistemic logic with common and distributed knowledge and resolution operators. We discuss related and future work and conclude in Section 5."}, {"heading": "2 Background", "text": "In this section we give a (necessarily brief) review of the main background concepts from the literature. We henceforth assume a countable set of propositional variables PROP and a finite set of agents AG. We let GR be the set of all non-empty groups, i.e., GR =\u2118(AG)\\ /0. An epistemic model over PROP and AG (or just a model) M= (S,\u223c,V ) where S is a set of states (or worlds), V : PROP\u2192 2S associates a set of states V (p) with each propositional variable p, and \u223c is a function that maps each agent to a binary equivalence relation on S. We write \u223ci for \u223c(i).\ns \u223ci t means that agent i cannot discern between states s and t \u2013 if we are in s she doesn\u2019t know whether we are in t, and vice versa. Considering the distributed knowledge of a group G \u2013 a key concept in the following \u2013 we define a derived relation \u223cG= \u22c2 a\u2208G \u223ca (it is easy to see that \u223cG is an equivalence relation). Intuitively, someone who has all the knowledge of all the members of G can discern between two states if and only if at least one member of G can discern between them. We will also consider common knowledge. A similar relation modeling the common knowledge of a group is obtained by taking the transitive closure of the union of the individual relations: vCG= ( \u22c3 i\u2208G \u223ci)\u2217.\nDefinition 1 Below are several languages from the literature.\n(ELD) \u03d5 ::= p | \u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2227\u03d5 | Ki\u03d5 | DG\u03d5 (ELCD) \u03d5 ::= p | \u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2227\u03d5 | Ki\u03d5 | DG\u03d5 |CG\u03d5 (PACD) \u03d5 ::= p | \u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2227\u03d5 | Ki\u03d5 | DG\u03d5 |CG\u03d5 | [\u03d5]\u03d5,\nwhere p \u2208 PROP, i \u2208 AG and G \u2208 GR. We use the usual propositional derived operators, as well as EG\u03d5 for \u2227\ni\u2208G Ki\u03d5 . ELD and ELCD are static epistemic languages with distributed knowledge, and with distributed and common knowledge, respectively. These are the languages we will extend with resolution operators in the next section. We will also be interested in PACD, the language for public announcement logic with both common knowledge and distributed knowledge, when we look at completeness proofs.\nSatisfaction of a formula \u03d5 of any of these languages in a state m of a model M, denoted M,m |= \u03d5 , is defined recursively by the following clauses:\nM,m |= p iff m \u2208V (p) M,m |= \u00ac\u03d5 iff M,m 6|= \u03d5 M,m |= \u03d5 \u2227\u03c8 iff M,m |= \u03d5 & M,m |= \u03c8 M,m |= Ka\u03d5 iff \u2200n \u2208 S.

Validity is defined as usual: |= \u03d5 means that M,m |= \u03d5 for all M and m.\nWe now define some axiom schemata and rules.

An immediate question is: whenever the group G is a proper subset of the set of all agents, what do the other agents know about the fact that this event takes place? Here we will model situations where it is common knowledge among the other agents that the event takes place, but not what the members of the group learn. As discussed in the introduction, this corresponds to a natural class of information sharing events, namely publicly observable private communication, such as a meeting in a closed room that is observed to be taking place. This is captured by a global model update: in every state, remove a link to another state for any member of G whenever it is not the case that there is a link to that state for all members of G.\nFormally, given a model M = (S,\u223c,V ) and a group of agents G, the (global) G-resolved update of M is the model M|G where M|G = (S,\u223c|G,V ) and\n(\u223c|G)i = { \u22c2\nj\u2208G \u223c j, i \u2208 G, \u223ci, otherwise.\nWe consider the following new languages with resolution operators.\nDefinition 2 (Languages)\n(RD) \u03d5 ::= p | \u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2227\u03d5 | Ki\u03d5 | DG\u03d5 | RG\u03d5 (RCD) \u03d5 ::= p | \u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2227\u03d5 | Ki\u03d5 | DG\u03d5 |CG\u03d5 | RG\u03d5,\nwhere p \u2208 PROP, i \u2208 AG and G \u2208 GR.

There does not seem, however, to be a trivial relationship between the two types of dynamic operators. We are nevertheless able to make heavy use of the completeness proof of PACD in [13] when proving completeness of RCD. That proof is again based on the completeness proof for public announcement logic with (only) common knowledge found in [2, 5], extended to deal with the distributed knowledge operators (which is non-trivial since intersection is not modally definable). In the following completeness proof we tweak the PACD proof to deal with resolution operators instead of public announcement operators. The general proof strategy is as follows: define a finite canonical pseudo model, where distributed knowledge\noperators are taken as primitive, and then transform it to a proper model while preserving truth. For the last step we can use a transformation based on unraveling and folding in [13] directly.\nThe most important difference to the PACD completeness proof in [13], and indeed the crux of the proof, is the use of the induction rule for resolved common knowledge (RRC). No corresponding rule is needed in the PACD completeness proof. The rule is used in the proof of Lemma 3(8).\nPseudo Semantics\nDefinition 4 (Pre-models[13]) A pre-model is a tuple M= (S,v,V ) where: \u2022 S is a non-empty set of states; \u2022 v is a function which maps every agent and every non-empty group of agents to an equivalence\nrelation; we write vi and vG for v(i) and v(G) respectively; \u2022 V : PROP\u2192\u2118(S) is a valuation. vCG is defined as the reflexive transitive closure of \u22c3 i\u2208G vi, just as for a model.\nA pre-model is technically a model with a bigger set of agents (all groups are treated as agents in a pre-model). More precisely, if we make the set of agents A explicit in a pre-model, e.g., M= (A,S,v,V ), then M is in fact a \u201cgenuine\u201d model (S,v,V ) where the set of agents is A\u222a (\u2118(A)\\ /0). Definition 5 (Pseudo models[13]) A pseudo model is a pre-model M=(S,v,V ) such that for any agent i and any groups G and H, \u2022 v{i}=vi, and \u2022 G\u2286 H implies vH\u2286vG.\nA pointed pre-model (resp. pointed pseudo model) is a tuple (M,s) consisted of a pre-model (resp. pseudo model) M and a state s in M.\nDefinition 6 (Pseudo semantics) Given a pre-model M = (S,v,V ), let m be a state in M. Satisfaction at (M,s) is defined as follows:\nM,s |=p p iff s \u2208V (p) M,s |=p \u00ac\u03d5 iff M,s 6|=p \u03d5 M,s |=p \u03d5 \u2227\u03c8 iff M,s |=p \u03d5 & M,s |=p \u03c8 M,s |=p Ki\u03d5 iff (\u2200t \u2208M)(svi n\u21d2M, t |=p \u03d5) M,s |=p CG\u03d5 iff (\u2200t \u2208M)(svCG t\u21d2M, t |=p \u03d5) M,s |=p DG\u03d5 iff (\u2200t \u2208M)(svG t\u21d2M, t |=p \u03d5) M,s |=p RG\u03c8 iff M|G,s |=p \u03d5,\nwhere M|G = (S,v|G,V ) such that\n(v|G)i = { vG, i \u2208 G vi, i /\u2208 G and (v|G)H = { vH\u222aG, H \u2229G 6= /0 vH , H \u2229G = /0\nSatisfaction in a pre-model M (denoted by M |=p \u03d5) is defined as usual. We use |=p \u03d5 to denote validity, i.e. M,s |=p \u03d5 for any pointed pre-model (M,s). We write |= instead of |=p when there is no confusion.\nProposition 8 Let M be a pseudo model, G a group of agents. Then M|G is a pseudo model.\nPROOF See the appendix.\nProposition 9 Propositions 6 and 7 still hold for pseudo models.\nWhen we regard a pre-model as a genuine model, classical (individual) bisimulation becomes an invariance relation. To make this clear, we first elaborate the definition of bisimulation for pre-models, and then introduce its invariance results.\nDefinition 7 (Pre-model bisimulation) Let two pre-models M = (S,v,V ) and M\u2032 = (S\u2032,v\u2032,V \u2032) be given. A non-empty relation Z\u2286 S\u00d7S\u2032 is called a bisimulation between M and M\u2032, denoted by M M\u2032, if for all \u03c4 \u2208 AG\u222aGR, all s \u2208 S and s\u2032 \u2208 S\u2032 such that sZs\u2032, the following hold. (at) For all p \u2208 PROP, s \u2208V (p) iff s\u2032 \u2208V \u2032(p); (zig) For all t \u2208 S, if s\u223c\u03c4 t, there is a t \u2032 \u2208 S\u2032 such that s\u2032 \u223c\u2032\u03c4 t \u2032 and tZt \u2032; (zag) For all t \u2032 \u2208 S\u2032, if s\u2032 \u223c\u2032\u03c4 t \u2032, there is a t \u2208 S such that s\u223c\u03c4 t and tZt \u2032. We say that pointed pre-models (M,s) and (M\u2032,s\u2032) are bisimilar, denoted (M,s) (M\u2032,s\u2032), if there is a bisimulation Z between M and M\u2032 linking s and s\u2032.\nProposition 10Resolution preserves pre-model bisimulation. I.e., for all pointed pre-models (M,s) and (M\u2032,s\u2032), if (M,s) (M\u2032,s\u2032) then (M|G,s) (M\u2032|G,s\u2032).\nPROOF See the appendix.\nCorollary 2 For any pre-models M and M\u2032, if (M,s) (M\u2032,s\u2032) then M,s |=p \u03d5 iff M\u2032,s\u2032 |=p \u03d5 for any RCD formula \u03d5 .\nAs introduced in [13], we can also consider a kind of bisimulations between genuine models and pre-models.\nDefinition 8 (Trans-bisimulation [13]) Let a model M= (M,\u223c,V ) and a pre-model N= (N,v,\u03bd) be given.

We write Z : (M,m) T (N,n) if Z is a trans-bisimulation between M and N linking m and n. We say a pointed model (M,m) and a pointed pre-model (N,n) are trans-bisimilar, denoted by (M,m) T (N,n), if there is a trans-bisimulation Z such that Z : (M,m) T (N,n).\nTo make the notation symmetric, we call Z a trans-bisimulation between N and M if it is a transbisimulation between M and N, and we regard Z : (N,n) T (M,m) just as Z : (M,m) T (N,n).\n(Pseudo) satisfaction of RCD formulas is invariant under trans-bisimulation.

If \u03d5 is valid on all pseudo models, then it is provable in RCD.\nFrom Pseudo Completeness to Completeness By using unraveling and folding from [13, pp. 9\u201315], we can transform the canonical pseudo model to a bisimilar pre-model and then to a trans-bisimilar proper model. It remains to show that this process preserves truth. We will use T to denote the transbisimulation relation.\nLemma 6 (Invariance of trans-bisimulation) Let (M,m) be a pointed model, (N,n) a pointed premodel, and (S,s) a pointed pseudo model. If (M,m) T (N,n) (S,s), then M,m |= \u03d5 iff N,n |=p \u03d5 for all formulas \u03d5 .\nPROOF The lemma can be shown by induction on \u03d5 . Here we only show the case for the resolution operators, proofs of other cases are exactly as in the proof of [13, Lemma 26].\nGiven a pointed model (M,m), a pointed pre-model (N,n) and a pointed pseudo model (S,s), such that Z : (M,m) T (N,n) for some Z and (N,n) (S,s), we have the following:\nM,m |= RG\u03c8 iff M|G,m |= \u03c8 iff N|G,n |=p \u03c8 (\u2217) iff N,n |=p RG\u03c8,\nwhere to show (\u2217) it is sufficient to show that Z : (M|G,m) T (N|G,n), as (\u2217) is then guaranteed by the induction hypothesis (note that (N|G,n) (S|G,s) by Proposition 10). Let M = (M,\u223c,V ) and N= (N,v,\u03bd). \u2022 The case for (at) holds by Z : (M,m) T (N,n). \u2022 As for (ziggr), suppose m(\u223c|G)Hm\u2032 for some m\u2032 \u2208M and |H| \u2265 2.\n\u2013 If G\u2229H = /0, (\u223c|G)H =\u223cH .

Let H0 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = Hx = H. Thus n vH \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 vH n\u2032. Since (v|G)H =vH , it holds that n(v|G)H \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7(v|G)Hn\u2032, and so (ziggr) holds in this case. \u2013 If G\u2229H 6= /0, (\u223c|G)H =\u223cG\u222aH . By Z : (M,m) T (N,n) there is an n\u2032 \u2208 N such that m\u2032Zn\u2032 and n vH0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 vHx n\u2032 with G\u222aH \u2286 H0 \u2229 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u2229Hx. Thus n vG\u222aH \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 vG\u222aH n\u2032. Since (v|G)H =vG\u222aH , It holds that n(v|G)H \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7(v|G)Hn\u2032. (ziggr) holds also in this case. \u2022 The case for (zigag) is analogous. \u2022 The case for (zag). For all n\u2032 \u2208 N and all \u03c4 \u2208 AG\u222aGR, if n(v|G)\u03c4n\u2032, then we must show that there is\nan m\u2032 \u2208M such that m\u2032Zn\u2032 and m(\u223c|G)\u03c4m\u2032. \u2013 If \u03c4 is an agent i. Then if i \u2208 G, (v|G)i =vG, otherwise (v|G)i =vi. By Z : (M,m) T (N,n), we\nhave m\u223cG m\u2032 if i \u2208 G, or m\u223ci m\u2032 otherwise. Namely m(\u223c|G)im\u2032 in either case. \u2013 If \u03c4 is a group H. Then if G\u2229H = /0, (v|G)H =vH , otherwise (v|G)H =vG\u222aH . By Z : (M,m) T (N,n), we have m\u223cH m\u2032 if G\u2229H = /0, or m\u223cG\u222aH m\u2032 otherwise. Namely m(\u223c|G)Hm\u2032 in either case.\nWe have shown that the lemma holds for the case for resolution. For other cases we refer to the proof of [13, Lemma 26].\nTheorem 3 (Completeness) For anyRCD formula \u03d5 , if \u03d5 is valid then it is provable in RCD.\nPROOF It suffices to show that any RCD-consistent formula is satisfiable. Let \u03d5 be consistent. Let Mc be the canonical pseudo model for cl(\u03d5). By the pseudo truth lemma (with n = 0, i.e., an empty list of resolution operators), \u03d5 is satisfied in a state \u0393 in Mc. Now let NMc be the unraveling [13, Definition 18]3 of Mc. NM c is a pre-model [13, Proposition 19]. Now let (NM c )\u2217 be the folding [13, Definition 22] of NM c . (NM c )\u2217 is a (proper) model [13, Definition 22]. From [13, Lemma 27] and [13, Lemma 28]\nwe have that unraveling preserves bisimulation and that folding preserves trans-bisimulation, in other words we have that4 (M,\u0393) (NMc ,\u0393) T ((NMc)\u2217,\u0393). By Corollary 2, (NMc ,\u0393) |=p \u03d5 . By Lemma 6, ((NM c )\u2217,\u0393) |= \u03d5 and we are done."}, {"heading": "5 Discussion", "text": "In this paper we captured the dynamics of publicly observable private resolution of distributed knowledge. Resolution operators (using update semantics) are both an alternative and a complement to the standard distributed knowledge operators (which use standard modal semantics).\nResolution operators let us reason about the relationship between common knowledge and distributed knowledge in general, and in particular about distributed knowledge as potential common knowledge \u2013 when can distributed knowledge become common knowledge? A naive idea would be that DG\u03d5 should imply that RGCG\u03d5 \u2013 any information that is distributed can become common knowledge through resolution. This does not hold in general, however, due to Moore-like phenomena \u2013 \u03d5 might even become false after resolution (an example is the formula D{1,2}(p\u2227\u00acK1 p) discussed in the introduction). We do, however, have the following (Prop. 4(2) with G = H):\nRGCG\u03d5 \u2194 DGRG\u03d5.\nA fact can become common knowledge after the group have shared their information if and only if it was distributed knowledge before the event that the fact would be true after the event. This is exactly the distributed knowledge that can become common knowledge (in our special case of publicly observable private resolution of distributed knowledge). If the grand coalition resolves its distributed knowledge, there is no distinction between distributed and common knowledge any more: RAGCAG\u03d5 \u2194 RAGDAG\u03d5 (Prop. 3).\nAs discussed in the introduction, it has been argued that distributed knowledge in general does not comply with the following principle of full communication [12]: if DG\u03d5 is true, then \u03d5 follows logically from the set of all formulas known by at least one agent in the group. This is seen as a problem: namely that agents can have distributed knowledge without being able to establish it \u201cthrough communication\u201d [12]. Several papers [12, 7, 10] have tried to characterize classes of models on which the principle of full communication does hold \u2013 the class of all such models is called full communication models [10]. This may seem related to the distinction between distributed knowledge and resolution operators: the latter is intuitively related to internal \u201cfull\u201d communication in the group. However, this similarity is superficial: the notion of full communication in the sense of [12] is about expressive power of the\n3While unraveling is a standard general technique; here we mean unraveling exactly in the sense of the mentioned definition. 4Here \u0393 is any path in the unraveling starting with \u0393.\ncommunication language and the limits that puts on the resulting possible epistemic states under certain assumptions about how information is shared. The key point of the resolution operators, on the other hand, compared with the standard distributed knowledge operators, is to make a distinction between before and after the information sharing event. That distinction is not made in standard distributed knowledge \u2013 even restricted to full communication models: it is easy to see that, e.g., D{1,2}(p\u2227\u00acK1 p) is satisfiable also on full communication models. The two ideas, of limiting models to full communication models and of modeling group information sharing events using model updates, are orthogonal, and there is nothing against restricting logics with the resolution operators to full communication models. We leave that for future work. Furthermore, it would be interesting to look at a combined variant: \u201cupdate by full communication\u201d, which takes the communication language into account when defining the updated model.\nA main interest for future work is expressive power. Can it be shown that RCD is strictly more expressive than ELCD? Another, related, natural question is the relative expressivity ofRCD and PACD: can the combination of public announcement operators (which eliminate states) and distributed knowledge operators (which pick out states considered possible by everyone) always be used to \u201csimulate\u201d the resolution operators (which eliminate states considered possible by everyone)?\nAlso of interest for future work is to look at other assumptions about the other agents\u2019 knowledge about the group communication event taking place. In this paper we only studied the case that it is common knowledge that the event takes place (but not what the agents in the group learn). That was naturally modeled using a \u201cglobal\u201d model update: in every state, replace accessibility for each agent in the group with the group accessibility (intersection). An interesting and also natural alternative is doing only a \u201clocal\u201d model update: change accessibility in the same way, but only in the current state. That would correspond to it being common knowledge that if this is the current state, then the group resolves their knowledge.\nWhen looking at the interaction of the resolution and common knowledge operators one might be reminded of relativized common knowledge [3, 4]. Here is an open question: can RGCH\u03d5 be expressed using relativized common knowledge, in combination with other operators?\nFinally, there is a conceptual relationship to group announcement logic [1], where formulas of the form \u3008G\u3009\u03d5 say that G can make a joint public announcement such that \u03d5 will become true. A difference to the resolution operators in this paper is that latter model private communication. Yet, the exact relationship between these operators is interesting for future work."}, {"heading": "6 Acknowledgments", "text": "Y\u0131\u0300 N.

Clearly M|G = (S,v|G,V ) is a pre-model. Moreover,\n1. Given an agent i,\n(v|G){i} = { v{i}\u222aG i \u2208 G v{i}, i /\u2208 G\n= { vG i \u2208 G vi, i /\u2208 G\n= (v|G)i. 2. Given two groups H and H \u2032 such that H \u2286 H \u2032,\n(v|G)H \u2032 = { vH \u2032\u222aG H \u2032\u2229G 6= /0 vH \u2032 , H \u2032\u2229G = /0\n(v|G)H = { vH\u222aG H \u2229G 6= /0 vH , H \u2229G = /0\nSo we have: \u2022 when H \u2229G 6= /0 (and therefore H \u2032\u2229G 6= /0), (v|G)H \u2032 = vH \u2032\u222aG \u2286 vH\u222aG = (v|G)H ; \u2022 when H \u2032\u2229G = /0 (and therefore H \u2229G = /0), (v|G)H \u2032 =vH \u2032\u2286vH= (v|G)H ; \u2022 otherwise H \u2032\u2229G 6= /0 and H \u2229G = /0, and in this case (v|G)H \u2032 = vH \u2032\u222aG \u2286 vH = (v|G)H .\nM|G is a pre-model satisfying the two conditions above, which shows it is a pseudo model.\nProof of Proposition 10 Let M=(S,v,V ) and M\u2032=(S\u2032,v\u2032,V \u2032). Thus M|G =(S,v|G,V ) and M\u2032|G = (S\u2032,v\u2032|G,V \u2032). Suppose Z : (M,s) (M\u2032,s\u2032), and we show Z : (M|G,s) (M\u2032|G,s\u2032):\n(at) This clearly follows from the (at) clause of Z : (M,s) (M\u2032,s\u2032). (zig) For all t \u2208 S, if s(v|G)Ht, then\n\u2013 If G\u2229H = /0, then (v|G)H =vH and (v\u2032|G)H =v\u2032H . By Z : (M,s) (M\u2032,s\u2032) there must be a t \u2032 \u2208 S\u2032 such that s\u2032(v\u2032|G)Ht \u2032 and tZt \u2032. \u2013 If G\u2229H 6= /0, then (v|G)H =vG\u222aH and (v\u2032|G)H =v\u2032G\u222aH . By Z : (M,s) (M\u2032,s\u2032) there must be a t \u2032 \u2208 S\u2032 such that s\u2032(v\u2032|G)Ht \u2032 and tZt \u2032. If s(v|G)it, we can prove analogously to the above.\n(zag) This can be shown analogously to the case for (zig).\nProof of Theorem 2 It is easy to verify that (S5), (CK), (DK), (NR), (RA), (RC) and (RN) are all valid or admissible with respect to the class of all pseudo models. Here we only show that i) (RD1) and (RD2) are valid in all pseudo models, and ii) (RRC) preserves validity of pseudo models.\nLet M= (S,v,V ) be a pseudo model and s \u2208 S. We show the following: \u2022 M,s |=p RD1 and M,s |=p RD2, i.e.,\n\u2013 If G\u2229H 6= /0, then M,s |=p RGDH\u03d5 \u2194 DG\u222aHRG\u03d5; \u2013 If G\u2229H = /0, then M,s |=p RGDH\u03d5 \u2194 DHRG\u03d5 .\nM,s |=p RGDH\u03d5 iff M|G,s |=p DH\u03d5 iff M|G, t |=p \u03d5 for all t s.t. (s, t) \u2208 (v|G)H iff M, t |=p RG\u03d5 for all t s.t. (s, t) \u2208 (v|G)H iff \u2020 if G\u2229H 6= /0, M, t |=p RG\u03d5 for all t s.t. (s, t) \u2208v|G\u222aH ,\nif G\u2229H = /0, M, t |=p RG\u03d5 for all t s.t. (s, t) \u2208v|H iff if G\u2229H 6= /0, M, t |=p DG\u222aHRG\u03d5, and\nif G\u2229H = /0, M, t |=p DHRG\u03d5,\nwhere the \u2020 step is by definition:\n(v|G)H = { vH\u222aG, G\u2229H 6= /0, vH , G\u2229H = /0.\n\u2022 M,s |=p \u03d5 \u2192 RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03c8 under the assumption |=p \u03d5 \u2192 (EH\u03d5 \u2227RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGn\u03c8). The proof is similar to the proof for genuine models.\nProof of Proposition 11 Suppose that M = (S,v,V ) is the canonical pseudo model for cl(\u03b1). We need to show that M is a pseudo model. Namely,\n1. S is non-empty, and 2. all vi\u2019s and vG\u2019s are equivalence relations, and 3. V is a valuation from PROP to \u2118(S), and 4. vi=v{i} for every agent i, and 5. vH\u2286vG if G and H are groups such that G\u2286 H.\nConditions 1\u20133 are the conditions for being a pre-model which are easy to verify. Conditions 4 and 5 are additional conditions for being a pseudo model.\nBy Definition 9(3), Ki\u03d5 and Di\u03d5 must be in cl(\u03b1) both or neither. Thus, for any \u0393,\u2206 \u2208 S,\n\u0393vi \u2206 iff {Ki\u03d5 | Ki\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393}= {Ki\u03d5 | Ki\u03d5 \u2208 \u2206} iff {Di\u03d5 | Di\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393}= {Di\u03d5 | Di\u03d5 \u2208 \u2206} (Axiom DK1) iff \u0393v{i} \u2206.\n\u0393vH \u2206 iff {DH \u2032\u03d5 | DH \u2032\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393}= {DH \u2032\u03d5 | DH \u2032\u03d5 \u2208 \u2206}, for any group H \u2032 \u2286 H \u21d2 {DG\u2032\u03d5 | DG\u2032\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393}= {DG\u2032\u03d5 | DG\u2032\u03d5 \u2208 \u2206}, for any group G\u2032 \u2286 G iff \u0393vG \u2206.\nThis finishes the proof, and shows that the notion \u201ccanonical pseudo model\u201d is well-defined. Proof of Lemma 2(2) Let \u03d5 \u2208 cl(\u03b1). By ` ( \u2228 \u00ac\u03d5\u2208\u0393\u2208S \u0393)\u2192\u00ac\u03d5 and the first result of this lemma (i.e.,\n` \u2228 \u00ac\u03d5\u2208\u0393\u2208S \u2228 \u2228 \u03d5\u2208\u0393\u2208S) we get ` \u03d5 \u2192 \u2228 \u03d5\u2208\u0393\u2208S \u0393. For the converse direction, suppose 0 \u2228 \u03d5\u2208\u0393\u2208S \u0393\u2192 \u03d5 .\nThen \u00ac( \u2228 \u03d5\u2208\u0393\u2208S \u0393\u2192 \u03d5) is consistent. Namely \u00ac\u03d5 \u2227 \u2228 \u03d5\u2208\u0393\u2208S \u0393 is consistent. But this is impossible.\nProof of Lemma 3(8) Let RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 \u2208 cl(\u03b1). It follows from the definition of closure (Definition 9) that the following formulas: \u2022 D\u03b4 ({i},G1,...,Gn)RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 where i \u2208 H \u2022 D\u03b4 (H,G1,...,Gn)RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 \u2022 RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGn\u03d5 and \u00acRG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGn\u03d5 are all in cl(\u03b1). From left to right. Suppose RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393, we continue by induction on the length of the path that every \u3008G1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Gn\u3009-resolved H-path from \u0393 is a canonical RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5-path. Then the left-to-right\ndirection follows: by ` CH\u03d5 \u2192 \u03d5 , NR and RG-distribution (which follows from RR axioms) we get ` RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 \u2192 RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGn\u03d5 , and by RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGn\u03d5 \u2208 cl(\u03b1) we have RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGn\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393.\nSuppose the length of the \u3008G1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Gn\u3009-resolved H-path is 0, i.e., the path is \u3008\u0393\u3009, we must show that RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393. This is guaranteed by the supposition.\nSuppose the length of the \u3008G1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Gn\u3009-resolved H-path is n+ 1, i.e., the path is \u3008\u03930 \u03c40 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c4n\u22121 \u0393n \u03c4n \u0393n+1\u3009 with \u03930 = \u0393 and every \u03c4x is either in H or a subset of H. By the induction hypothesis we may assume that RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393n. \u2022 Suppose \u03c4n is an agent i (i \u2208 H). By Axiom C1 we have ` CH\u03d5 \u2192 KiCH\u03d5 . It follows that `\nRG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 \u2192 RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnKiCH\u03d5 by the rules NR and RG-distribution. Let \u03b4 = \u03b4 ({i},G1, . . . ,Gn). By the reduction axioms we move Ki left, i.e., ` RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnKiCH\u03d5 \u2192 D\u03b4 RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 , so we get ` RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5\u2192D\u03b4 RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 . Hence \u0393n `D\u03b4 RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 . As D\u03b4 RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 \u2208 cl(\u03b1), we have D\u03b4 RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393n. Moreover, by Proposition 9, i=v\u03b4 . Thus D\u03b4 RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393n+1 by the definition of v\u03b4 , and so RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393n+1. \u2022 Suppose \u03c4n is a group I (I \u2286 H). By Axioms C1, D1 and D2 we have ` CH\u03d5 \u2192 DICH\u03d5 . By NR\nand RG-distribution, ` RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 \u2192 RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnDICH\u03d5 . By similar reasoning to the case above, we get the result RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393n+1 (we use \u03b4 (H,G1, . . . ,Gn) instead of \u03b4 ({i},G1, . . . ,Gn) in this case).\nIn both cases we get RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393n+1 as we wish to show. From right to left. Suppose that every \u3008G1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Gn\u3009-resolved H-path from \u0393 is a canonical RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGn\u03d5path. Let S0 be the set of all maximal consistent sets \u2206 in cl(\u03b1) such that every \u3008G1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Gn\u3009-resolved H-path from \u2206 is a canonical RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGn\u03d5-path. Now consider the formula\n\u03bb = \u2228\n\u2206\u2208S0\n\u2206\nWe will show the following: 1. ` \u0393\u2192 \u03bb 2. ` \u03bb \u2192 (EH\u03bb \u2227RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGn\u03d5). From the above and the reduction rule for resolved common knowledge we get ` \u0393\u2192 RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 which furthermore entails RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGnCH\u03d5 \u2208 \u0393. We now continue with the proof of the two clauses.\n1. This is trivial, as \u0393 is one of the disjuncts of \u03bb . 2. Suppose towards a contradiction that\n\u03bb \u2227\u00ac(EH\u03bb \u2227RG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGn\u03d5)\nis consistent, i.e., \u03bb \u2227 (\u00acEH\u03bb \u2228\u00acRG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGn\u03d5) is consistent. Because \u03bb is a disjunction there must be a disjunct \u039e of \u03bb such that \u039e\u2227 (\u00acEH\u03bb \u2228\u00acRG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGn\u03d5) is consistent. It follows that either \u039e\u2227\u00acEH\u03bb or \u039e\u2227\u00acRG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGn\u03d5 is consistent.\nIf the former is consistent, then there must be an agent i \u2208 H such that \u039e\u2227\u00acKi\u03bb is consistent, i.e., \u039e\u2227 K\u0302i\u00ac \u2228 \u2206\u2208S0 \u2206 is consistent. Since ` \u2228 \u2206\u2208S \u2206 by Lemma 2, we have ` \u00ac \u2228 \u2206\u2208S0 \u2206\u2192 \u2228 \u2206\u2032\u2208S\\S0 \u2206\n\u2032, and so there must be a \u0398 in S \\S0 such that \u039e\u2227 K\u0302i\u0398 is consistent. By item 4 of this lemma \u039e vi \u0398 (where v is the relation in the canonical pseudo model for cl(\u03b1)). But then \u039e cannot be in S0 for \u0398 /\u2208 S0. A contradiction!\nIf the latter is consistent, since \u00acRG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGn\u03d5 \u2208 cl(\u03b1) and \u039e is maximal, \u00acRG1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7RGn\u03d5 \u2208 \u039e.

what someone who is able to discern between two possible worlds whenever any member of the group can discern between them, would know. Sometimes distributed knowledge is referred to as the potential knowledge of a group, or the joint knowledge they could obtain if they had unlimited means of communication. In epistemic logic, the formula DG\u03c6 is intended to express the fact that group G has distributed knowledge of \u03c6 , that there is enough information in the group to infer \u03c6 . But this is not the same as reasoning about what happens if the members of the group share their information. In this paper we introduce an operator RG, such that RG\u03c6 means that \u03c6 is true after G have shared all their information with each other \u2013 after G\u2019s distributed knowledge has been resolved. The RG operators are called resolution operators. Semantically, we say that an expression RG\u03c6 is true iff \u03c6 is true in what van Benthem [11, p. 249] calls (G\u2019s) communication core; the model update obtained by removing links to states for members of G that are not linked by all members of G. We study logics with different combinations of resolution operators and operators for common and distributed knowledge. Of particular interest is the relationship between distributed and common knowledge. The main results are sound and complete axiomatizations.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
