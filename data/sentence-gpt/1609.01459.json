Introduction", "text": "It is well known fact that brain-like learning in machine oriented systems have significant benefits in real world and synthetic data problems. However, the most suitable brain-cognitive approach to the data learning problem still remains a primary problem and have troubled researchers world-wide. While some algorithms do very well in certain tasks, they perform poorly in others confirming the \u201cNo-Free Lunch Theorem\u201d (NFLT). Nevertheless, competitive machine learning systems that employ brain-like algorithms have evolved over time and present a promising alternative to a wide variety of machine learning algorithms. Two algorithms stand out as major candidates for future ML systems. The Cortical Learning Algorithms (CLA) proposed in (Hawkins et al, 2011) and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1998) have shown promising results in recent times, however, HTM-CLA seems to model closely the intelligent behavior of cortical micro-circuits. In this paper, we introduce yet another model of brain-like learning. This model is inspired by the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) effect elicited in real humans. HTM-CLAs (HTM-CLAs) have the unique ability to predict its own activation and they offer a generative procedure for building cellular data; Cellular data is a very important component of hierarchical memory-based learning systems as they allow the unique predictive capabilities found in most cortical generative models).\nHTM-CLA do not account for MMN effect. Specifically they do not use our deviant (Real Absolute Deviation (RAD) modeling approach. As described in the Numenta white paper (Numenta, 2007), postpredictive ability with slowness through time is a very essential component of machine learning systems with intelligent abilities. Our model possess the unique ability to enforce slowness through time. Our model incorporates the ideas of predictive coding with the MMN effect in (Liedler et al, 2013) to evolve a deviant model of the world. It also encourages the use of the overlap concept as in HTM-CLA with good postpredictive abilities.\nOur primary goal here is to develop a model algorithm that builds on the strengths of CLA. Such a model should also account for the MMN effect as this can prove useful in a wide range of computational problems.\nThis paper is organized as follows:\nIn section 2 we briefly review related works that inspired this paper. Brain-like theories and ideas for deeper understanding of this paper is presented in Section 3 while Section 4 describes the Deviant Learning algorithm (DLA) based on the MMN effect. Next, we present and describe comparative results on the IRIS, HEART and Word-Similarity benchmark datasets using our DLA and the HTM-CLA. Finally, we conclude this paper with a discussion and suggest ideas that will further this work."}, {"heading": "2. Related Works", "text": "Over the years, brain-like learning in artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been described by many artificial intelligence (AI) researchers and various models proposed as the quest for a better machine intelligence close to human reasoning continues worldwide. More importantly, several AI approaches have recently captured the interest of the artificial intelligence community some of which include slow feature learning in (Wiskott and Sejnowski, 2002), the deep generative models in (Hinton, 2007) and deep recurrent models of (Schmidhuber, 1992; Schmidhuber et al 2012 and Graves et al, 2013), history compression models with a focus on unexpected inputs during learning (Schmidhuber, 1992), the spatiotemporal hierarchichal representations in (Hawkins et al, 2010) including the concept of sparse distributed representations as in (Ahmad and Hawkins, 2015). Also worth mentioning is the spiking neuron familiarity and frequency models in (Bogacz et al, 2000), predictive coding model in (Bastos et al, 2012) and neurocomputational models based on the Mismatch Negativity effect (Liedler, 2013b). While all these models have one thing in common - they all employ some form of connecting link for processing sensory information, they still fall short of real human brain requirements. One interesting feature to note is the inability of most of these models to account for large number of synapses in the neocortex, the seat of intelligence in the brain - see for instance the argument in (Hawkins and Ahmad, 2016). Nevertheless, arguments and counter-arguments have far reaching consequences and is still not sufficient to describe in algorithmic terms the primary requirements of a brain-like algorithm in software. Thus, the AI field is still at a loss at the most appropriate way to tackle the intelligent machine problem."}, {"heading": "3. Machine Brain-like Effects and Novel Theories", "text": "Brain-like theories such as discussed extensively in (Hawkins and Blakeslee, 2007) as a form of a memoryprediction framework, in (Hinton et al, 2006) as deep generative connectionist learning and as recurrent learning networks with Long Short-Term Memory in (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Gers et al, 1999) have had profound effect in the solution approaches used in today\u2019s AI software systems. One interesting feature of some of these theories is the ability of machine-life algorithms to remember and forget - an analogue of the birth-death theory. We strongly believe in this behavior as artificial life machines try to respond to its world by the formation of new memories and the extinction of past memories. This recreative process have strong genetic roots and is beyond the scope of this paper to describe every detail. In this section we discuss on some very important theoretical principles behind our deviant learning algorithm while inducing some novel ideologies in the process."}, {"heading": "3.1 MisMatch Negataivity (MMN) Effect", "text": "The Mismatch negativity effect (MMN) effect first discovered in the context of auditory stimulation in (Naatanen et al, 1978) is one possible neurobiological plausible attempt to model the behaviour of real\nworld neural tissue in a statistical way. It has also been studied in the context of visual modalities (see Pazo-Alvarez et al, 2003). In particular the MMN effect seeks to validate the differential response in the brain. Some important MMN theories may be found in (Liedler et al, 2013b). However, as discussed in (Liedler et al, 2013a), MMN theories are still debatable and not entirely conclusive up to this present moment. Some of the identified theories include (Liedler et al, 2013a): the Change Detection Hypothesis (CDH), Adaptation Hypothesis (AH), Model Adjustment Hypothesis (MAH), Novelty Detection Hypothesis (NDH) and the Prediction Error Hypothesis (PEH)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Reticular Formation and Synaptic Response", "text": "Responses to sensory impulses have historically been defined by the reticular forming units which serve as some sort of familiarity discrimination threshold detector with possible hypothalamic gating abilities (Kimball, 1964). This functionality also shares some resemblance to the notion of permanence introduced in (Hawkins et al, 2010).Permanence have a depolarizing effect on the synapses leading to the state of \u201cpotential synapse\u201d i.e. synapses with a high likelihood of being connected. Thus, when the synapse connects, the neuron or cell fires."}, {"heading": "3.3 Incremental Learning and the Growing of Synapses", "text": "During post-predictive stage it is likely that the input exceeds the peak(s) of the generated units. In this situation it becomes necessary to grow more synapses in order to improve the learned observations in the neural ecosystem. This is achieved in the DLA using the parameter referred to as the learning extent. As an organism grows in age the learning extent should correspondingly increase. Thus, there is a total annihilation of previous primitive states to begin to learn more complex tasks."}, {"heading": "4. Deviant Learning Algorithm (DLA)", "text": "The Deviant Learning Algorithm (DLA) is approached using a systematic mathematical procedure. DLA in CPU-like structure is as shown in Figure 1. It is divided into two core phases - the pre-prediction and the post-prediction phases.

For the purposes of this study, the standards are assumed to be integer-valued representations of the input chain.

Experiments and Results", "text": "Experiments have been performed using three benchmark datasets for the classification and similarity estimation problems. The first two datasets are specifically a classification problem; these are the IRIS dataset which is a plant species dataset (Bache and Lichman, 2013) for categorizing the Iris plant into three different classes, the HEART dataset (Blake et al, 1998) for categorizing a heart condition as either an absence or a presence of a heart disease and the Word-Similarity dataset (Finkelstein, 2001) for estimating similarity scores.\nWe begin by defining some initial experimental parameters for the HTM-CLA and the DLA. For the HTMCLA, we build a hierarchy of cells using a Monte-Carlo simulation constrained by their corresponding permanence values. This modification is less computationally intensive than the technique of combinatorics\nproposed in (Ahmad and Hawkins, 2015). The parameters for the simulation experiments are given in Appendix 2. The classification accuracies for HTM-CLA and DLA are presented in Tables 1 and 2 respectively. We use a classification metric termed the mean absolute percentage classification accuracy (MAPCA).

Conclusion and Future Work\nA novel algorithm for cortical learning based on the MMN effect has been developed. Our model can learn long range context, classify and predict forward in time.
