In this paper, we present the application of Benford's law to a new network flow metric \"flow size difference\", which have not been studied by other researchers, to build an unsupervised flow-based intrusion detection system (IDS). The method was inspired by our observation on a large number of TCP flow datasets where normal flows tend to follow Benford's law closely but malicious flows tend to deviate significantly from it. To demonstrate the effectiveness of a flow-based system, we show that we can provide a way to increase data throughput by improving efficiency and a way to reduce data consumption by optimizing the efficiency and cost of a flow-based system. We propose that our proposed system-based intrusion detection system (IDS) is a way to reduce data usage when considering an application. A basic model is a network-based intrusion detection system that can be developed and implemented in a number of scenarios where we can identify or reduce the speed of flow-based data, and the costs of the system to implement a simple flow-based system such as an embedded system. Using our data flow-based system-based intrusion detection system, we introduce a very high-resolution, robust, and robust system-based intrusion detection system to control the cost of a flow-based system.\n\n\n\n\nThe primary objective of this paper is to develop a system-based intrusion detection system (IDS), which can be implemented through an artificial network intrusion detection system (IDS) with an artificial network network intrusion detection system.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "The advances of networking technologies have made the whole world (computes, people and things) far more connected than before, but the increasing connectivity has also lead to more opportunities to malicious attackers who find various ways to launch cyber attacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks [1], botnets [2], network worms [3], and phishing attacks (e.g. phishing emails and rogue WiFi access points) [4]. The increasing harm of network attacks have become so severe that such attacks have been becoming more and more frequent and sophisticated [5, 6].\nTo reduce and prevent harm that can be caused by network attacks, intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been studied by researchers and deployed by organisations in real world to detect potential attacks automatically [7, 8]. IDSs can be classified into network-based IDSs and host-based IDSs, which differ from each other in where the detector is deployed and what activities the detector is monitoring to make alerts. Network-based IDSs are deployed within a network and monitor network traffic passing by to identify potential attacks that may target any hosts of the network, while host-based IDSs are deployed on individual hosts (e.g. key servers and individual devices) and monitor local activities (both local processes, incoming and outgoing network traffic) to detect signs of suspicious behaviours. For this paper, we focus on network-based IDSs.\nAccording to how network-based IDSs detect potential attacks technically, they can be generally classified into four different categories: misuse-based, anomaly-based, specificationbased, and hybrid systems [7, 8]. Misused-based IDSs are largely based on defined patterns (sometimes called \u201csignatures\u201d) of known attacks so the detection process is around checking if the known patterns are matched. This approach has the advantage of producing very few false positives but\ncannot be generalized to cover unknown attacks and dynamically evolving attacks. On the other hand, anomalybased IDSs are based on learned normal activity profiles of the network traffic (for network-based IDSs) and the system (for host-based IDSs), so anything deviating from normal behavior will be labelled as suspicious, which allows coverage of totally unknown attacks but also unusual but non-malicious activities. Specification-based IDSs are very similar to anomaly-based IDSs but here the normal profiles are specified rather than learned. As its name implies, hybrid IDSs combine different approaches (typically a misusedbased component for known attacks and an anomaly-based component for unknown attacks) to overcome limitations of other simple approaches. Some researchers prefer other terms e.g. Debar et al. suggested using knowledge- and behavior-based IDSs for misuse- and anomaly-based IDSs [9], and Dras\u030car et al. proposed to classify (flow-based) IDSs based on the concept of similarity [10].\nAccording to the network traffic data used, network-based IDSs can also be classified into packet- and flow-based approaches [11\u201313]. Packet-based IDSs look at all packets passing by in the network traffic (looking into headers and/or packet payloads as well), but flow-based IDSs analyse characteristics of network flows (a sequence of network packets). Flow-based IDSs are computationally far more efficient, but have a coarser temporal resolution in locating attacks and can miss important information related to application-level attacks. Flow-based IDSs also have the advantage that they can be easily adapt to different/evolving network infrastructure and are considered more privacy-friendly as deep packet recording and inspection are avoided [14].\nA lot of network-based IDSs have looked at statistical approaches to detecting signs of attacks, and some natural statistical laws such as Zipf\u2019s law, Benford\u2019s law, the Pareto distribution and the Weibull distribution [15\u201318] have been explored to generate statistical features for IDS purposes [19\u201328]. The term \u201cnatural\u201d in such laws refers to the fact that many natural processes often follow them while artificially created ones tend to not. Since attacks are normally artificially crafted and mostly generate \u201cunnatural\u201d network traffic, those natural laws can often form the basis (or part) of an anomaly-based IDS.\nIn this paper, we report our observation that a new network flow metric we call\u201cflow size difference\u201dfollows Benford\u2019s law closely for normal TCP flows but not for malicious ones. We then propose a new method of applying Benford\u2019s law to this new metric to build an unsupervised network-based IDS to detect malicious TCP flows. In addition to having all merits of flow-based IDSs, our proposed IDS does not require any training and it provides two simple parameters with a clear semantic meaning so that the IDS operator can set and tailor the parameters intuitively to adjust the performance of the proposed IDS. The main limitation of the proposed method is that it requires a relatively large time window of flows (to provide statistical confidence) so its temporal resolution is relatively low, but this can be overcome by combining it with other IDSs with a higher temporal resolution (e.g. using the proposed method to detect early alerts with regions of interest which are then further analysed using other methods). The proposed IDS was inspired by our observations on\nstatistical analyses of a large number of TCP flow datasets, and its performance was verified with one closed and two public datasets.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we briefly overview related work on Benford\u2019s law and other related natural laws and also statistical IDSs. Section 3 gives a brief explanation to the concept\u201cnetwork flow\u201d and explains how we define TCP flows in our work. In Section 4 we introduce the basic concept behind the new metric \u201cflow size difference\u201d and explain how Benford\u2019s law can be applied to it for measuring (un)naturalness of TCP flows to distinguish malicious flows from normal ones. Section 5 presents some experimental evidence on the usefulness of Benford\u2019s law based naturalness detector with a number of selected network traffic datasets with normal, malicious and mixed TCP flows. Then, in Section 6 we report the experimental results of using the proposed naturalness detector to build a simple and fast threshold-based IDS, which was applied to a closed and two public labelled TCP flow datasets to show its potential as a new element for designing IDSs. We discuss operational advantages and limitations of the proposed methods and how it can be combined with other methods in Section 7, with some future work we plan to do. Finally, the last section concludes the paper."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Benford\u2019s Law", "text": "The first known description of Benford\u2019s law was given by Simon Newcomb in 1881 [29], but Newcomb\u2019s work was largely forgotten and later \u201crediscovered\u201d and studied more systematically by Frank Benford in 1938 [30].1 The simple form of the law states that the first digits of many real-life sets of numerical data follow the following probability distribution:\nPd = log10\n(\n1 + 1\nd\n)\n, (1)\nwhere d = 0, ..., 9 (each possible value of the first digit) and Pd denotes the probability of d. This simple form can be generalized to other bases other than 10 and other significant digits other than the first one [17, 32].\nResearchers have proposed different explanations to why Benford\u2019a law arises in real-life datasets [33\u201335] and one general agreement is that Benford\u2019s law applies to numbers with a scale-invariant distribution [33, 34], but a complete and convincing theoretical explanation remains unsettled due to some mathematical subtleties as described in [36].\nAlthough Benford\u2019s law holds for many real-life datasets, it is not a universal law as there are many exceptions. There are also some other statistical laws / distributions which are closely linked to Benford\u2019s law, such as the Stigler distribution [37], Zipf\u2019s law, the Pareto distribution [15, 16, 38], the Weibull distribution [18] and a generalized Benford\u2019s law with two added tunable parameters [39], which we will not discuss in details here due to space limit.\n1Some researchers prefer calling the law Newcomb-Benford Law (NBL) [31], but Benford\u2019s law remains the mostly used term. As a matter of fact, in [29] Newcomb actually implied that the law as an approximate phenomenon had been known to most people who frequently used logarithmic tables.\nDue to the fact that real-life datasets in many different fields follow Benford\u2019s law, it has find diverse applications in many applications reflected from the huge number of publications spreading across many disciplines [40, 41]. Particularly, Benford\u2019s Law has been one of the most-studied natural laws for fraud detection [42\u201344] and multimedia forensics [39, 45\u201348], which have close links to IDSs. Some researchers also proposed some generalized forms of Benford\u2019s law to adapt to solve practical problems, e.g., Fu et al. [39] proposed a generalized Benford\u2019s law with two tunable parameters to fit the multimedia forensics data they were studying."}, {"heading": "2.2 IDS", "text": "We have briefly discussed the general classification of IDSs in the Introduction, and here we will focus mainly on statistical methods particularly those based on natural statistical laws and applied to build anomaly-based IDSs which is the category our proposed method falls into.\nTheoretically speaking, statistics play a foundational role for all IDSs (even for methods not based on statistics directly) because an IDS\u2019s performance is essentially based on statistics of normal and malicious activities [49]. As a matter of fact, there is an implicit or explicit assumption that attack activity is statistically different from normal activity [8]. Another example is that all IDSs face a well-known issue called \u201cbase-rate fallacy\u201d: the probability of any malicious event takes place in the whole range of activities is generally very small and the benign activities almost always dominate over a relatively long period of time, which can lead to foundational difficulties to the design, development and testing of IDSs [50] e.g. it can be practically difficult (if not impossible) to get sufficient attack data to train and test an IDS based on supervised machine learning [10, 51].\nTo apply any statistical methods, one needs to have at least one random variable which can be observed over time and modelled by the IDS. In his seminal paper on anomaly-based IDSs [52] Denning call such random variables metrics, which will be the term we follow in this paper as well. The metric(s) chosen should allow normal and malicious activities to differ from each other statistically so that two different statistical models can be built to support classification. The observed samples of a selected metric may be used directly for classification purposes, but they can also be aggregated to derive other higher-level indicators (e.g. mean, standard deviation and entropy) before the classification step takes place. Here we use the term features to denote those indicators fed into a classification system for making decisions, which is a standard term used by the machine learning community to call data feed into a (statistical or non-statistical) classifier.\nWhile the statistical models of selected metrics do not have to be based on any assumed distributions (as argued by Denning [52]), many researchers noticed some metrics taken from non-malicious network traffic follow some known distributions closely but those from malicious deviate significantly [19\u201328]. Those distributions studied include Zipf\u2019s law, the Pareto distribution, the Weibull distribution and also Benford\u2019s law.\nSurprisingly enough, despite the fact that Benford\u2019s Law has\nbeen so widely used for fraud detection and digital forensics, there has been very limited work on applying Benford\u2019s law to IDS. The first work we are aware of was done by Hamadeh in his 2004 master\u2019s thesis [20]. In his work he looked at three candidate metrics: the number of hits of webserver, the number of bytes transmitted in the response, and the inter-arrival time between two consecutive visits. It was observed that the inter-arrival time followed Benford\u2019s law better than the other two. Hamadeh went further to mention the possibility of applying the observation to an IDS but fell short of actually conducting any experiment. Note that Hamadeh\u2019s work is not network flow based, but around activities of visiting a webserver. The only another work (and the only work on flow-based IDS) we could find is due to Arshadi and Jahangir [53] who showed that the inter-arrival time of two consecutive normal TCP flows Benford\u2019s law closely so an IDS can be built on top of this fact. They conducted some manual inspection on selected malicious flows, but did not build an actual IDS so its actual performance is unclear. Arshadi and Jahangir also studied the source of Benford\u2019s law and attributed it to the fact that normal TCP flows\u2019 inter-arrival time closely follows the Weibull distribution, which can derive Benford\u2019s law. In [28], Arshadi and Jahangir also studied using the Weibull distribution for modelling the inter-arrival time for IDS purposes, and provide some results on the actual performance of such an IDS."}, {"heading": "3. NETWORK FLOWS AND TCP FLOWS", "text": "Before we proceed to discuss our work in greater details, we need to clarify a bit more about what we mean by \u201cTCP flows\u201d and \u201cnetwork flows\u201d in general. IDS researchers do not have a consistent understanding on these two terms and different flow-based IDSs can use very different definitions of network flows.\nLoosely speaking, a (network) flow, which may sometimes be called a session, a stream, or a conversation, is a sequence of network packets sharing some common criteria such as two end-point IP addresses over the Internet [12, 54\u201356]. In principle, the network flow concept can be applied to any network protocol at any layer of a network. This concept has been widely used for network traffic monitoring purposes, and a specific protocol called NetFlow working at the IP layer was popularized by Cisco due to its widely deployed routers, which was later developed into IPFIX (Internet Protocol Flow Information Export), an IETF standard defined in a series of RFCs [56]. A flow does not necessarily correspond to a single communication session as defined by the underlying protocol, e.g. Fredj et al. [54] defined a flow as a collection of packets transmitting a complete document (such as a web page) and one definition Barakat et al. used in [54] is \u201ca stream of packets having the same/24 destination address prefix\u201d.\nWhile there are many different ways to define a network flow, one of the most common definition uses the following five criteria: source and destination IP addresses, source and destination port numbers (0 for protocols that do not use ports), and protocol type. When we talk about \u201csource\u201d and \u201cdestination\u201d it is clear that the flow defined is unidirectional, which is the case for NetFlow and IPFIX flows. However, as Bejtlich pointed out in [12], connection-oriented protocols (e.g. TCP) are more suited to be represented as a\nflow as compared to connectionless protocols (e.g. IP, UDP and ICMP). This is because the former are structured in such a way that there exists a clear beginning, middle, and end to a TCP session, whereas the latter are not structured around the concept of connections so often time expiration conditions have to be used to arbitrarily set flow boundaries. For connection-oriented protocols, each connection corresponds to a bidirectional flow which is the merge of the two unidirectional flows.\nIn flow-based IDSs different flow definitions are used. IP flows defined following NetFlow or IPFIX specifications are widely used [57] since such flow information can often be obtained directly from routers and supported by open-source tools such as NFDUMP [58] and NfSen [59]. Some researchers focused on bidirectional TCP flows only [53], which can be justified by the fact that most IP traffic over the Internet is TCP traffic (e.g. in [60] the ratio was reported to be 95.112%).\nIn this paper, we also focused on bidirectional TCP flows as Arshadi and Jahangir did in their work on [53] considering the dominance of TCP flows on the Internet and the fact that network flows are less well-defined for IP and other connectionless protocols. Note that selecting TCP flows naturally cover all application-layer protocols based on TCP (such as HTTP, the dominating protocol at the application layer [60]).\nWhen working with a pcap file captured by libpacap or WinPcap, the TCP flows we work with can be generated using the following command line with tshark (a command-line utility provided with WireShark): tshark -r <input pcap file> -q -z conv,tcp > <output file>. The output file will then contain a list of \u201cTCP conversations\u201d which is a term used by WireShark to denote TCP flows.2 In WireShark\u2019s user interface, TCP flows of a given network traffic dataset can be obtained via the menu item \u201cStatistics\u201d \u2192 \u201cConversation\u201d and then click \u201cTCP\u201d tab. Then the TCP flows shown in the interface can be exported using \u201cCopy\u201d button at the bottom. The TCP flow obtained this way contains the following attributes (those in boldface are essential for our work): source IP address, source port number, destination IP address, destination port number, total number of packets transferred between source and destination, total number of bytes transferred between source and destination, packets transferred from source to destination, bytes transferred from source to destination, packets transferred from destination to source, bytes transferred from destination to source, relative start time (as a timestamp, 0 = the beginning of the whole network traffic), duration, source-to-destination bitrate (bit per second), and destination-to-source bitrate. When working with other network traffic data, as long as we can extract the above attributes of each TCP flow in boldface, our proposed method will work without problem."}, {"heading": "4. OUR PROPOSED METHOD", "text": "In this section we will describe the basic concepts and different aspects we need to consider around our proposed\n2WireShark uses another term \u201cTCP stream\u201d to denote the payload of a\u201cTCP conversation\u201d. To avoid confusion we will use the term \u201cTCP flow\u201d consistently in this paper.\nmethod."}, {"heading": "4.1 IDS Structure and Component", "text": "We consider the typical structure of an anomaly-based IDS working with TCP flows. It starts with one or more selected metrics which should follow Benford\u2019s law closely for normal TCP flows but deviate from it significantly and consistently for malicious ones. Then, a number of samples of each selected metric will be collected (one per TCP flow) to detect any significant deviation from Benford\u2019s law, where we will use a sliding window to cover a sufficient number of TCP flows (i.e., samples of the metric) so that any deviation can be detected with high confidence and an acceptable temporal resolution (which will help tailor the detection accuracy as well especially to balance false positive and false negative rates). The flow window size W will be a system parameter, and it can be fixed or dynamically adapted depending on the nature of the networking environment being monitored. The deviation will be calculated based on a similarity metric between the Benford\u2019s law and the actually observed distribution, which is used as a feature for a binary classifier to classify each flow window into two classes: normal (nonmalicious), and malicious (attack).\nIf we have more than one usable metric, each one can be used alone or they can be combined to inform a classifier handling multiple features or the alerts generated from each metric are pooled to derive a single decision. In this paper, we look at a simpler setting: each usable metric is used alone and a simple threshold T is used to construct a binary classifier. We go for the simpler setting because our main gaol here is to identify new metrics that can be used to augment any IDSs rather than to produce yet another IDS competing with other systems. We actually do not anticipate our IDS will outperform many other IDSs due to its simplistic structure. To some extent, the proposed IDS structure is used to set up a proper context so that we can test the usefulness of the identified metrics in more complicated IDSs. In our future work we will look at more complicated settings and how the identified new metrics can be used to improve other IDSs. We will discuss more about these issues in Section 7."}, {"heading": "4.2 The Metrics", "text": "As mentioned above, the first and the most important component of our IDS is at least one metric that can work with Benford\u2019s law. Since we aim at identifying new metric, we do not look at the inter-arrival time already studied by other researchers [53]. Looking at the attributes of a TCP flow listed at the end of Section 3, we identified two candidate metrics that have not been previously studied for IDS:\nFlow size: The flow size distribution has been studied extensively in the networking literature and estimation of flow size distribution has been an active research topic [61, 62]. It has been known that the flow size distribution is typically long-tailed and its exact form heavily depends on the underlying protocol and the networking environment [63]. Flow size distribution has been been studied in IDS but mostly for entropy-based approaches where the entropy of the observed distribution is calculated as a feature for detection [64, 65]. We were unaware of work linking flow size distribution to Benford\u2019s law so found it interesting to investigate flow size as a new metric for applying Benford\u2019s law to IDS.\nFlow size difference: In addition to flow size, we also found \u201cflow size difference\u201d, which is defined as the numeric difference of two consecutive TCP flows\u2019 sizes, seems to be another candidate metric of interest because it inherits some features of flow size (e.g. long-tailedness) but also differs significantly from flow size itself. We did not find any work on the distribution of flow size difference of TCP flows or on its application in IDS3, which is not totally surprising since flow size difference does not seem to be obviously useful for network traffic analysis and management. However, our quick experiments revealed it seemed to follow Benford\u2019s law, so we added it as a candidate. For flow size difference, we will ignore the sign bit so the metric we are considering here is actually the absolute value of the flow size difference. In the following, we will simply use the term \u201cflow size difference\u201d to denote the absolute value unless otherwise stated.\nNote that the flow size can be defined by bytes or packets, so we actually have two different variants for each of the above two metrics. These two variants are not linked but cannot be directly derived from each other since the packet size (in byte) varies over time and cross applications."}, {"heading": "4.3 From Flows to Flow Windows", "text": "Since Benford\u2019s law is a distribution, we need to collect enough samples of a given metric to be able to construct an observed distribution which then can be compared against the target distribution for detecting deviation. This is why we need to have a flow window for any distribution-based IDSs, which is a well-known fact. Since the Benford\u2019s law distribution has only 9 values, it can be expected that the minimum flow window size will not be very large which will make sure that the temporal resolution of the IDS is not too low. We will report our experimental results in Section 5 on how the value of W can be determined. In addition to the parameter flow window size W , there is also another one \u201cwindow sliding step\u201d S which defines how the flow window slides. In principle S can range from 1 to W , and taking a smaller value can potentially help refine the temporal resolution to some extent. In our work, we take S = W/2 as a representative value."}, {"heading": "4.4 Flow Ordering", "text": "For flow size difference, changing ordering of flows will obviously change each sample of the metric and thus its observed distribution. For flow size, ordering will not make a direct difference, but can influence what flows are included in each flow window thus influence the observed distribution. It is therefore a valid question to ask if such ordering will make a difference and if so how we should order flows. Looking at all the attributes of a TCP flow, we selected the following four typical ordering options for consideration:\n1. (Start Time, End Time)\n2. (End Time, Start Time)\n3. (Source IP address, Destination IP address, Start Time)\n3If we know the flow size distribution, it is possible to derive the distribution of the flow size difference assuming the flow size is an i.i.d. sequence which is unfortunately not the case for most cases.\n4. (Source IP address, Source Port number, Destination IP address, Destination Port number, Start Time)\nEach attribute in the above ordering option is considered from the left to right for ordering. When some flows have the same values for all ordering criteria, the original order in the raw network traffic log will be kept. Since Benford\u2019s law is a natural law and scale-invariant, we hypothesized that the ordering should not have a big impact on the compliance with (for normal flows) or deviation from (for malicious flows) Benford\u2019s law. Our experimental results will be given in Section 5."}, {"heading": "4.5 Zero Handling", "text": "For flow size difference we have to consider a special issue: zero is now a possible value since two consecutive flows can have the same size (which is highly likely in some attacks such as DDoS and port scanning). Since Benford\u2019s law does not actually cover the digit zero, we need handle such zero flow size differences properly to avoid system crashing and false detections. There are several options we can consider: 1) skipping all zeros; 2) extending Benford\u2019s law to cover digit zero, i.e. simply add P (0) = 0 into the target distribution so now we have 10 digits to consider (but 0 should never appear). The first option is trivial to implement but may lose important information about a specific pattern (repeated flows of the same size) around some attacks. The second option looks trivial to implement but has one nontrivial issue regarding how we can measure goodness of fit and deviation from Benford\u2019s law which will be discussed in the next subsection."}, {"heading": "4.6 Measuring Goodness of Fit / Deviation", "text": "To check the goodness of fit to and deviation from the target distribution described by Benford\u2019s law, we need a proper similarity metric. One of the most commonly-used metrics in applications of Benford\u2019s law is the \u03c72 divergence [39, 45\u2013 48] which can be defined for Benford\u2019s law case as follows:\n\u03c72 = 9 \u2211\nd=1\n(P\u0302d \u2212 Pd) 2\nPd , (2)\nwhere Pd is the probability of first digit d defined in Benford\u2019s law as in Eq. (1) and P\u0302d is the actually observed probability of d. It is effectively the test statistic of Pearson\u2019s \u03c72 test [66] against the target distribution.\nIn the IDS context, there are many other similarity metrics one can use for the goodness of fit / deviation test. In a 2015 survey [67] Weller-Fahy et al. gave a very comprehensive overview of this topic, classifying different metrics used in network-based IDSs into four categories: 1) power distances (e.g. Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance), 2) distances on distribution laws (e.g. \u03c72 divergence, KullbackLeiber divergence, and entropy-based metrics), 3) correlation similarities (e.g. Spearman \u03c1 rank correlation, Kendal \u03c4 rank correlation, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, and the cosine similarity), and 4) other metrics (e.g. dice similarity and Geodesic distance).\nIn our initial experiments investigating the potential of Benford\u2019s law (as reported in Section 5), we stick to the \u03c72 divergence.

We also repeated this experiment with some other datasets and observed largely the same pattern, therefore we decided to chose flow size difference for other experiments. The potential of using flow size is not totally excluded but we leave it for our future work."}, {"heading": "5.3 How to Determine Flow Window Size?", "text": "As we discussed in the previous section, the flow window size W is a parameter of the IDS which can allow some level of performance control. While we expected W does not need to be too large, we need some indication of how we can set it. For a selected dataset (LBNL/ICSI dataset), we thus calculated the average \u03c72 divergence value of all flows when the flow window size W changes from 500 to 20,000, increasing with a step size of 250. Figure 1 shows the results. As can be seen, the average \u03c72 divergence value decreases rapidly initially but the decreasing rate keeps dropping while W increases. Note that the initial divergence value is also very small (below 0.02) so the results suggest W can probably be set to a value between several hundred or thousand in most cases."}, {"heading": "5.4 Flow Ordering", "text": "Another experiment was conducted to check if the flow ordering can change how flow size difference follows Benford\u2019s law.

To test its potential further, we ran a large-scale experiment to calculate \u03c72 divergence values for a large number of TCP flow windows of many datasets in all the three groups. We used two representative window size (2,000 and 10,000) and a sliding window step 1 in order to get sufficient data to look at statistics of the \u03c72 divergence values. Tables 2, 3 and 4 show the results for the three different groups of datasets, respectively. Note that the \u03c72 divergence values of different datasets should be compared directly as those datasets correspond to completely different networking environments and capturing methods. Despite the diversity of the datasets and the observable fluctuations of the \u03c72 divergence values especially the maximum values, largely speaking the \u03c72 divergence value does have a high tendency to following the following order: non-malicious < mixed < malicious. This suggests flow size difference may indeed be a good metric for building an anomaly-based IDS for detecting malicious flows."}, {"heading": "6. IDS PERFORMANCE EVALUATION", "text": "In this section we provide details of our further experiments to evaluate the performance of a simple IDS built on top of the identified flow size difference metric. As we mentioned above, the IDS has only one metric and its structure is simple, so our goal is not to make it outperform other IDSs but to provide evidence that even with such a single metric the IDS has a reasonable performance so it has the potential to be used with other metrics and methods to design IDSs with better overall performance. Due to many well-known and complicated issues around performance evaluation of IDSs [10, 51, 82], it is actually not trivial to compare performance of multiple IDSs fairly even if we want. Although we will not report comparison with other IDSs, we chose to release our source code so that other researchers can easily verify the results we reported and incorporate our work into their IDSs to conduct further performance analysis. Our source code was written in MATLAB and can be downloaded from http://www.hooklee.com/Papers/Data/BenfordsLawIDS/source_code.zip Note that the source code is written to produce the performance evaluation results reported in this section, rather than as a ready-to-use IDS, but it should be straightforward to translate our code into a deployable IDS written in any programming language."}, {"heading": "6.1 Datasets Used", "text": "As pointed out by many other IDS researchers [10, 51, 82], there is a general lack of public labelled datasets for evalu-\nating and comparing performance of IDSs. The two mostly used datasets in the past are the DARPA dataset [83] released in 1999 (and updated in 2000 with some specific scenarios), and the KDD Cup 1999 dataset [84] which was derived from DARPA dataset. Both datasets have serious design flaws known to the IDS community for long, and those attacks presented in the dataset are very out-dated. Their use is in general discouraged and most researchers go for closed datasets obtained from their own networks or from industrial collaborators, which are seldom made public thus making precise reproduction of published results impossible. There are some recent efforts of creating new public IDS datasets [72, 85, 86], but none of them have no their own drawbacks.\nFor our work here, we decided to use a private dataset we call \u201cTRT dataset\u201d hereinafter, which was provided by Thales UK, Research and Technology (TRT), for this research. The TRT dataset contains 17 days of network traffic from a medium-sized network. The dataset contains two subsets. The first subset was captured in a simulated network, with\nlong periods of (simulated) normal traffic and occasional attacks of different types. The \u201cinet\u201d probe was located at the boundary of the network, to intercept all traffic entering and leaving the network from the Internet. The second subset was from a real student cyber security laboratory. It contains a lot of background traffic when the students were not there, but this was largely UDP traffic and hence not used in our testing. When the students were there, they were doing a lot of (simulated) attacks as part of their practice and learning, and hence there is little \u201cnormal\u201d TCP traffic in these datasets. Putting both subsets together, we have a balanced dataset with both periods with normal and malicious activities to test our IDS. The TRT dataset was originally not labelled but textual description about each day\u2019s activity was provided, and the labelling was done for this research by a volunteer (Florian Gottwalt) who was working at TRT while the research was taking place.\nIn addition to the above TRT dataset, we also decided to test our IDS with two public datasets: the KDD Cup 1999 dataset [84] and NLD-KDD 2009 dataset [87]. The KDD\nCUP 1999 dataset has attacked connections and normal connections simulated in a military network environment, and the NLD-KDD 2009 dataset is a cleaned and re-sampled subset of the KDD Cup 1999 dataset to fix some of its known problems [85]. The main reason for including these two public datasets is to provide a minimum level of reproducibility of our results reported in this work."}, {"heading": "6.2 Dataset Pre-Processing", "text": "All the three datasets used have labels at flow level, but our IDS works at the flow window level, so we needed to convert the flow labels to flow window labels. The most natural way of doing the conversion is to introduce a threshold Tl \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,W } and then label a flow window as malicious if there are at least Tl malicious flows. More precisely, assuming a flow window contains W flows whose labels are {li = 0 or 1} W i=1 (1 means malicious and 0 means normal),\nthen this flow window\u2019s label L can be determined as follows:\nL = sign\n((\nW \u2211\ni=1\nli\n)\n\u2212 Tl\n)\n, (3)\nwhere\nsign(x) =\n{\n1, if x \u2265 0,\n0, otherwise.\nNote that the threshold Tl may also be represented as a ratio between 0 and 1: tl = Tl/W ."}, {"heading": "6.3 Benchmarking Metric", "text": "Instead of reporting detection accuracy indicators such as false positive and false negative rates, we decided to use the AUC (area under curve) of the ROC (receiver characteristic curve) of the threshold-based IDS as our main benchmarking metric. This is because our IDS has tunable parameters so reporting accuracy figures alone is not sufficient. We were aware that the ROC is not the best benchmarking tool for\nIDSs, but found it more straightforward to use for our proposed IDS to demonstrate the usefulness of using flow size difference for IDS purposes. Advanced benchmarking metrics normally introduce new factors (e.g. costs [88]) or additional steps (e.g. adaptive thresholding [89]), which we would like to avoid as they can unnecessarily over-complicate the performance evaluation task. Since we expect flow size difference as a metric will be used together with other metrics and methods to design more complicated IDSs, we leave investigation on advanced benchmarking metrics as our future work."}, {"heading": "6.4 Experimental Results", "text": "We conducted extensive experiments on different parameter settings of the IDS with the KDD Cup 1999 and TRT datasets. For the KDD Cup 1999 dataset, the window sizes we tested include 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2500 and 5000, and for the TRT dataset we tested W = 250 to 5000 with a step size of 250. In general, our results on the KDD Cup 1999 dataset are very good but those on the TRT dataset are relatively worse which may be caused by the normal flows being artificially simulated and attacks were done students who were learning cyber security (so both are less natural). All the similarity metrics worked reasonably well, but it seemed the Euclidean distance performed the best overall cross both datasets and all different settings. The two different variants of flow size difference (in byte and in packet) did not seem to perform significantly differently.\nThe IDS\u2019s performance has some dependency on the flow window size W and the threshold Tl (tl), which is expected as the latter can influence the temporal resolution and both influence the definition on when a flow window is considered malicious. Note that the threshold Tl (tl) is not an operational parameter as the IDS manager does not need to adjust it, but it will influence how the performance of the IDS is interpreted as it influence how malicious flow windows are defined based on malicious flows.\nWe also conducted some experiments with the NSL-KDD 2009 dataset, and surprisedly observed some nearly perfect results for tl = 0.5 when \u03c7\n2 divergence was used as the similarity metric (see Fig. 4 in which one can se the AUC went up to 1 when W = 5000). When Euclidean distance was used instead, the performance went to another extreme: the AUC fluctuates around 0.5 suggesting the IDS failed completely. While we found these results difficult to interpret, one possible explanation is that the resampling and cleaning mechanisms used by the authors of this dataset [85] may have introduced strange artifacts into the data (e.g. the discontinuities caused by such processing) thus making the result very sensitive to parameters and setting changes. The NSL-KDD 2009 dataset also contains significantly less TCP flows, which implies the results are less representative."}, {"heading": "7. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "The results of detection accuracy shown above should be seen with caution as for all the three datasets the attacks are not necessary representative in other networking environments. The ground-truth labels in the TRT dataset were manually done by a human expert who looked at the network traffic data without information of what actually happened during the traffic recording sessions. To some extent\nwe can consider the TRT dataset\u2019s labels as ratings of a human expert on suspiciousness of flows, so putting all the results together, we can argue that the proposed IDS does work in predicting what a human expert would produce. The fact that the proposed IDS works on both the public datasets (which have various known drawbacks) and a relatively more recent and independent dataset implies the proposed method is robust as well. In future we plan to test the proposed IDS on more datasets to further verify its performance across more recent datasets. We hope to be able to establish collaboration with some network service providers to test our method with real-world network traffic and attacks. We also plan to make use of the automatically labelled (using an ensemble of automated IDSs) MAWILab dataset [86] to test our work against other IDSs and a more diverse set of network traffic.\nThe proposed measure provides a new metric (flow size difference) one can use to augment any existing IDSs. Some possible ways to achieve this include: 1) adding the flow size difference as a new metric into an IDS with some other metrics so there are more features the classifier can use; 2) using the flow size difference based IDS as an early warning system to trigger other more advanced IDSs to focus on regions of interests in the network traffic; 3) using the flow size difference based IDS as a secondary IDS to identify missing attacks; 4) using the flow size difference based IDS to generate pseudo-labels for semi-supervised training of a more complicated IDS.\nUsing the simple form of Benford\u2019s law without any generalization means no parameter estimation is needed. In addition, the flow size difference based IDS is a simple threshold based IDS without the need to be trained (which is a common merit of all distribution based IDSs). The IDS does have some adjustable parameters but they can be set intuitively and based on observed statistics of the similarity metric, which can be done by a simple software tool processing all historical flows (both normal and malicious ones). Even when such historical data is not available, one can still set some initial value and then incrementally adjust the parameters while normal and malicious flows are being observed.\nAs a whole, the IDS can be easily deployed without much burden of \u201cmaking it ready\u201d.\nThe two main operational parameters of the flow size difference based IDS are: the classifier\u2019s decision threshold T , the flow window size W . The former can be used to balance false negative and false positive rates, and the latter to balance detection accuracy and temporal resolution. Note that W will influence the false negative and false positive rates as well (as shown in the previous section) but in an indirect way. Both parameters have a clear semantic meaning from an IDS operator\u2019s point of view: 1) T is the deviation from Benford\u2019s law, as measured by the selected similarity metric; 2) W simply define how many flows one need to observe before making a decision. Typical initial values of both parameters can be set to T = 0.3 and W = 1000 according to our experiments on the TRT dataset. We envisage W is more stable so once a preferred value is set it will remain for a longer time without the need to be changed, but T may evolve more quickly especially due to adaptation of attackers to hide their traces.\nAssuming the attackers are aware of the use of flow size difference as a metric for IDS, they can change their attacking strategies so that the network traffic generated from their attacks will fall below the alerting threshold. There are at least two possible strategies: 1) adapt the attacks\u2019 network traffic precisely to match the target distribution, which is often difficult or impossible for attackers as they normally don\u2019t have any control of other parallel users and network devices\u2019 activities and attack flows; 2) reduce the level of attack activity so that it hides well in normal traffic, which effectively leads to a special kind of network-based information hiding (which will require a completely different treatment for detection). The second strategy may make some attacks completely meaningless (harmless) e.g. for DDoS slowing down the incoming traffic will make the attack itself fail by definition. For some other attacks, the second strategy will normally be acceptable (e.g. port scanning or online password guess) but will significantly increase the costs of performing the target attack and the chance of the attack being captured by other means (e.g. other IDS methods). If launching an attack requires too much time, the target may\nalso become unavailable e.g. if the target is a moving object or does not have a permanent network address like a mobile device.\nWe focused at bidirectional TCP flows in this work. Our initial tests on other types of network flows such as unidirectional TCP flows seemed to show Benford\u2019s law may not be applied directly, which can be explained by the observation that many unidirectional TCP flows are often highly asymmetric (more and larger packets from server to client). Possible applications to other types of flows such as IP, ICMP and UDP flows require more work as well since such flows are normally defined as unidirectional and the sessional boundary is not as clearly defined as in the TCP case.\nIn our future work we will also investigate if and how our work can be generalized beyond the simple form of Benford\u2019s law. For instance, we will also look at Benford\u2019s law with a base different from 10, the generalized Benford\u2019s law [39] and other natural laws such as Zipf\u2019s law [15, 16] and the Stigler distribution [37] (in case the simple Benford\u2019s law does not work in some cases e.g. UDP flows)."}, {"heading": "8. CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper investigates possible applications of Benford\u2019s law to anomaly-based network flow IDS and reports a new working metric which has not been studied: flow size difference. Different from flow size, flow size difference has been rarely studied in both IDS and the networking literature, but our study showed that it is a good metric in terms of Benford\u2019s law: normal non-malicious TCP flows follows it closely but malicious ones deviate from it significantly. We conducted a large number of experiments with many network traffic datasets to verify the observation, and used it to construct a simple threshold-based IDS. The IDS was tested with three labelled datasets (one closed dataset plus two public datasets) and it has been shown the performance of the IDS is promising, especially considering its simple structure. We call for more research on the use of flow size difference in IDS research, particularly on how to use it to augment other IDS methods."}, {"heading": "9.

"abstractText": "Statistical characteristics of network traffic have attracted a significant amount of research for automated network intrusion detection, some of which looked at applications of natural statistical laws such as Zipf\u2019s law, Benford\u2019s law and the Pareto distribution. In this paper, we present the application of Benford\u2019s law to a new network flow metric \u201cflow size difference\u201d, which have not been studied by other researchers, to build an unsupervised flow-based intrusion detection system (IDS). The method was inspired by our observation on a large number of TCP flow datasets where normal flows tend to follow Benford\u2019s law closely but malicious flows tend to deviate significantly from it. The proposed IDS is unsupervised so no training is needed thus can be easily deployed. It has two simple parameters with a clear semantic meaning, allowing the human operator to set and adapt their values intuitively to adjust the overall performance of the IDS. We tested the proposed IDS on one closed and two public datasets and proved its efficiency in terms of AUC (area under the ROC curve). Being a simple and fast standalone IDS itself, the proposed method can also be easily combined with other network IDSs e.g. added as an additional component into another existing IDS to enhance its performance.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
