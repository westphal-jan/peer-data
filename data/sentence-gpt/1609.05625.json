Unlike last year's English MGB Challenge, which focused on recognition of diverse TV genres, this year, the challenge has an emphasis on handling the diversity in dialect in Arabic speech. Audio data comes from 19 distinct programmes from the Aljazeera Arabic TV channel between March 2005 and December 2015. Programmes are split into three groups: conversations, interviews, and reports. A total of 1,200 hours have been released with lightly supervised transcriptions for the acoustic modelling. For language modelling, we made available over 110M words crawled from Aljazeera Arabic website Aljazeera.net for a 10 year duration 2000-2011. Two lexicons have been provided, one phoneme based and one grapheme based. Finally, two tasks were proposed for this year's challenge: standard speech transcription, and word alignment.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "The second round of the Multi-Genre Broadcast MGB [1] challenge is a controlled evaluation of Arabic speech to text transcription, as well as supervised word alignment using Aljazeera TV channel recordings. This year MGB-2 uses a multi-dialect dataset, spanning more than 10 years of Arabic language broadcasts. The total amount of speech data crawled from Aljazeera using the QCRI Advanced Transcription System (QATS)[2] was about 3,000 hours of broadcast programs, whose durations ranged from 3\u201345 minutes. For the purpose of this evaluation, we used only those programs with transcription on their Arabic website, Aljazeera.net. These\nAuthors listed alphabetically.\ntextual transcriptions contained no timing information. The quality of the transcription varied significantly: the most challenging were conversational programs in which overlapping speech and dialectal usage was more frequent.\nThe Arabic MGB challenge had two main evaluation conditions:\n\u2022 Speech-to-text transcription of broadcast audio. \u2022 Alignment of broadcast audio to a provided transcrip-\ntion.\nIn this paper we describe the challenge data and provided metadata, with a focus on metadata refinement and data preparation. We discuss the two evaluation conditions in greater detail, and also outline the baseline systems provided for each task. We then outline the different systems that participants developed for the challenge, and give an overview for each of the provided system."}, {"heading": "2. MGB-2 CHALLENGE DATA", "text": "The Arabic MGB-2 Challenge used more than 1,200 hours of broadcast videos recorded during 2005\u20132015 from the Aljazeera Arabic TV channel. These programs were manually transcribed, but not in a verbatim fashion. In some cases, the transcript includes re-phrasing, the removal of repetition, or summarization of what was spoken, in cases such as overlapping speech. We found that the quality of the transcription varies significantly. The WER between the original transcribed text from Aljazeera to the verbatim version is about 5% on the development set."}, {"heading": "2.1. Metadata challenges", "text": "We have selected Aljazeera programs that were manually transcribed (albeit without timing information). A total of 19 programs series were collected, recorded over 10 years. Most, but not all, of the recorded programs included the following metadata: program name, episode title, presenter\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n05 62\n5v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n4 M\nay 2\nname, guests\u2019 names, speaker change information, date, and topic. The duration of an episode is typically 20\u201350 minutes, and the recorded programs can be split into three broad categories; conversation (63%), where a presenter talks with more than one guest discussing current affairs; interview (19%), where a presenter speaks with one guest; and report (18%), such as news or documentary. Conversational speech, which includes the use of multiple dialects and overlapping talkers, is a challenging condition and is the typical scenario for political debate and talk show programs.\nMuch of the recorded data used in MGB-2 was Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): we estimate that more than 70% of the speech is MSA, with the rest in Dialectal Arabic (DA), which we categorised as: Egyptian (EGY), Gulf (GLF), Levantine (LEV), and North African (NOR). English and French language speech is also included, where typically the speech is translated and dubbed into Arabic. This is not marked in the transcribed text.\nThe original transcription has no clear metadata structure that would enable domain classification, so we decided to perform classification based on the keyword tags that are provided for the 3,000 episodes to define 12 domain classes, namely: politics, economy, society, culture, media, law, science, religion, education, sport, medicine, and military. Because some domains have a very small number of programs, we merged them to the nearest domain to have a coarse-grained classification as shown in Figure 1, where the politics domain is the most frequent class."}, {"heading": "2.2. Data Processing and Light Alignment", "text": "Removing programs with damaged aligned transcriptions resulted in a total of about 1,200 hours of audio, which was released to MGB-2 participants. All programs were aligned using the QCRI Arabic LVCSR system [3], which is graphemebased using a 1:1 word-to-grapheme mapping. It used LSTM acoustic models and trigram language models with a vocabulary size of about one million words. The same language\nmodel and decoding setup was used for all programmes. For each programme, the ASR system generated word-level timings with confidence scores for each word. This ASR output was aligned with the original transcription to generate small speech segments of duration 5\u201330 seconds suitable for building speech recognition systems.\nAs shown in [6] and based on the Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm1, we used to identify matching sequences by performing local sequence alignment to determine similar regions between two strings. We addressed two challenges when aligning the data:\n1. The original transcription did not match the audio in some cases owing to edits to enhance clarity, paraphrasing, the removal of hesitations and disfluencies, and summarisation in cases such as overlapping speech.\n2. Poor quality ASR output in cases such as noisy acoustic environments, dialectal speech, use of out of vocabulary words, and overlapped speech.\nWe applied two levels of matching to deal with these challenges: exact match (where both transcription and ASR output are identical), and approximate match (where there is a forgiving edit distance between words in the transcription and ASR output). To evaluate the quality of alignment between ASR output and the transcription, we calculated the \u201canchor rate\u201d for each segment as follows:\nAnchorRate = #MatchedWords\n#TranscriptionWords (1)\nThe AnchorRate across all segments came with the following; 48% exact match, 15% approximate match, and 37% with no match. More details about the AnchorRate distribution is shown in figure 2.\nTo assign time for non-matching word sequences, we used linear interpolation to force-align the original text to the remaining speech segments.\n1https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm\nAfter aligning the whole transcript, each audio file was acoustically segmented into speech utterances, with a minimum silence duration of 300 milliseconds. The metadata for aligned segments includes timing information obtained from the ASR, speaker name, and text obtained from the manual transcription. For each segment, the Average Word Duration in seconds (AWD), the Phoneme Matching Error Rate (PMER), and Word Matching Error Rate (WMER) are stored in the given meta-data.\nOverall, more than 550,000 segments with a total duration of 1,200 hours were made available together with the aligned transcription and metadata. Figure 3 shows segment distribution according to AWD value, and Figure 4 shows segment distribution according to cumulative AWD value. Figure 5 shows Cumulative duration for grapheme and word matching error rate.\nDuring data preparation, we removed about 300 hours, mainly coming from very short audio clips with the corresponding full transcription. These audio clips are just the highlights of other programmes. No further filtering was applied to the 1,200 hours data."}, {"heading": "2.3. Lexicon", "text": "Two lexicons were made available for participants in the challenge: A grapheme-based lexicon2 and with more than 900K entries 1:1 mapping, and phoneme lexicon3 with more than 500K words average with 1:4 mappings using our previous Vowelization to Phonetization (V2P) pipeline [3]. Participants could also choose any lexicon outside the provided resources."}, {"heading": "2.4. Further Data Improvement", "text": "We found that in some cases, the silence information coming from the ASR system was inaccurate and could lead to poor segmentation. This was mainly because the silence model in the basline ASR system [2] acted as a garbage model, absorbing non-speech noise and sometimes overlapping speech. A number of approaches could potentially improve the segmentation: a) run an ASR system with separate models for silence, and non-speech noise; b) employ an externally-trained Voice Activation Detection (VAD) system and apply on silences; c) train and use a seprate model for overlap speech detection; d) apply a word alignment algorithm to get better timing for each word using the text of each programme to build an in-domain LM. We would not expect a better segmentation to make big impact on the quality of the ASR training data. However, it will be crucial for future challenges in dialect detection and potential dialectal diarization.\n2http://alt.qcri.org/resources/speech/dictionary/arar grapheme lexicon 20160209.bz2\n3http://alt.qcri.org/resources/speech/dictionary/arar lexicon 201403- 17.txt.bz2"}, {"heading": "3. EVALUATION TASKS", "text": "The MGB-2 Challenge featured two evaluation tasks, transcription and alignment. For each the only allowable acoustic and language model training data was that specified above. To enable comparability, there was no option for participants to bring additional training data to the evaluation. Use of the provided other resources (e.g. dictionary) was optional."}, {"heading": "3.1. Speech-to-text transcription", "text": "This is a standard speech transcription task operating on a collection of whole TV shows drawn from diverse Arabic dialectal programmes from Aljazeera TV channel. Scoring required ASR output with word-level timings. Segments with overlapped speech were scored but not considered in the main ranking. Overlapped speech was defined to minimise the regions removed \u2013 at the segment level where possible. As the training data comes from only 19 series, some programmes from the same series appeared in training, development and evaluation data. Each show in the development and evaluation set was processed independently, so no speaker linking across shows was given. The data were carefully selected to cover different genres, and being diverse among the five dialects. Development and evaluation came from the last month of 2015 to avoid being seen in the trainig data. The duration of each file was between 20 minutes and 50 minutes with a total duration of 10 hours for each set. These files were verbatimely transcribed, and manually segmented for speech/silence/overlapped-speech with segment length was between 3 seconds and 10 seconds. Words with hesitation or correction were also marked by adding a special symbol at the end of these words. Four WER numbers were reported for the speech-to-text task:\n\u2022 Scoring the original text as being produced by manual transcription, which may have punctuation/diacritization. \u2022 Scoring after removing any punctuation or diacritization. \u2022 Scoring using the Global Mapping File (GLM), which is the official results for the competition. This deals with various ways for writing numbers, and common words with no standard orthography. \u2022 Scoring after normalizing Alef, Yaa, and Taa Marbouta characters in the Arabic text, i.e. assuming that these kinds of differences are not considered as errors because they can be easily corrected using surface spelling correction component."}, {"heading": "3.2. Alignment", "text": "In this task, participants were supplied with a tokenised version of the transcription as published on the broadcaster\u2019s website, without timing information. The task was to align the given transcription to the spoken audio at word level. The\noriginal transcription often differs from the actual spoken words. Scoring was performed by using a precision/recall measure, derived from the automatic alignment of a careful manual transcription. A word is considered to be a match if both start and end times fall within a 100 milliseconds window of the associated reference word. More details about alignment scoring can be found here [1]."}, {"heading": "4. BASELINE SYSTEM", "text": "We provided an open source baseline system for the challenge, via a GitHub repository4. Data was shared in XML format5. The baseline system included data pre-processing, data selection, acoustic modelling (AM), and language modelling (LM), as well as decoding. This allowed participants to focus on more advanced aspects of ASR and LM modelling. A Kaldi toolkit [4] recipe was made available for the MGB2, and for language modelling the SRILM [5] toolkit was used. The baseline system was trained on 250 hours sampled from the training data, comes from 500 episodes. This system uses a standard MFCC multi-pass decoding:\n\u2022 The first pass is GMM FMLLR with 5,000 tied states, and 100K total Gaussians. \u2022 The second pass is trained using sequence MPE DNN with four hidden layers, and 1024 neurons per layer. \u2022 A tri-gram language model is trained on the normalised version of the sample data text (250 hours).\nThe baseline results were reported on 10 hours verbatim transcribed development set: 34% (8.5 hours) for the non-overlap speech and 73% (1.5 hours) for the overlap speech."}, {"heading": "5. SUBMITTED SYSTEMS AND RESULTS", "text": "Eight teams submitted systems to the MGB-2 challenge in the speech-to-text task. There has been no submission for the alignment task. We have attempted to highlight key features of various systems below. Detailed system descriptions are available at http://mgb-challenge.org/.\nTask 1: Speech-to-text transcription \u2022 QCRI: They have used 1,200 hours for training. They\napplied data augmentation with speed factors of 0.9,1.0, and 1.1. This gives them three times the original speech utterances. The speed perturbed data is followed by volume perturbation. For AM, they used three LFMMI trained models; TDNN, LSTM and BLSTM. The three AM combined using MBR. For LM, they used three LMs; tri-gram for the first pass decoding and interpolated four-gram and RNN with MaxEnt connections for LM rescoring. Their final WER was 14.7%.\n4https://github.com/Qatar-Computing-ResearchInstitute/ArabicASRChallenge2016\n5http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/\n\u2022 LIUM: They have aligned the training data, and applied data selection. Their total realigned data is about 650 hours. They used both grapheme and phoneme modelling. For their phoneme system, they have used automatic vowelizer followed by pronunciation rules [7] with an average 1.6 pronunciation per lexicon entry. Their main contribution comes from data selection, training four neural network for AM of different types (DNN and TDNN), with various acoustic features (PLP, BNF, GMMD), and two types of phonetization. The final system, obtained through a confusion network combination of the four developed systems. Their final results were 16.7%, and 15.7% as a late submission. \u2022 MIT: They have used the 1,200 hours for training, they used several neural network topologies; feed-forward, CNN, TDNN, LSTM, H-LSTM, and G-LSTM. The models capturing temporal context (LSTMs) outperformed all other models. A discriminatively trained five layer G-LSTM was the best performing acoustic modelling. Their best results came from system combination of the top two hypothesis from the sequence trained G-LSTM models. Their final results were 18.3%. \u2022 NDSC: They have selected data with zero WMER and an AWD ranging from 0.3s to 0.7s, and applied LTMD for further filtering. This gives them about 680 hours for training. For AM, they trained hyprid DNN, LSTM, and TDNN systems. Speed perturbation was used in the LSTM system. RNNLM was used for LM rescoring. They used MBR for their system combination which gives them an additional 0.9% absolute reduction in WER. They have also investigate automatic segmentation based on long-term information, the final results using automatic segmentation has 1.2% absolute increase in WER. Their final results were 19.4% using the automatic segmentation, and 18.2% using the manual segmentation for the official submission.\nThe results for all the submitted systems are listed in Table 1, and 2. For each submission we have four results: WER1: scored with original text, WER2: scored after removing punctuation and vowelization, WER3: scored using the GLM, and WER4: scored after normalization. More details about the scoring is mentioned in section 3.1. WER3 using the Global Mapping File is the official score.\nTask 2: Alignment There has not been any submission for the alignment task in the MGB-2, so, we share here the base line system for alignment with a precision of 0.83 and recall 0.7 and F measure of 0.76. This has been calculate using 100 msec as window for accepting the timing. Total words in reference 55K words, and hypothesis has 47K words and match count is 39K words. The evaluation looks for matches within 100 milliseconds of the start/end times of each word which was difficult."}, {"heading": "6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE CHALLENGES", "text": "The MGB-2 challenge continued the effort for using fixed training sets for acoustic modelling and language modelling training for building complete speech recognition system. This Year challenge was focusing on Arabic with multidialectal challenge. More than 1,200 hours with lightly supervised transcription have been shared coming from Aljazeera TV programs, along with more than 110 million words from Aljazeera.net web archive. We have achieved wide range of participant from 13 teams. With eight successful submissions. We had two tasks for this year speech-to-text; the baseline WER was 34%, and the best system submitted was 14.7%. The top ranked systems were focusing in using combination of several deep and sequential neural network modelling for acoustic modelling. For language modelling, the main focus was on combining RNN with n-gram based. Both grapheme and phoneme units have been investigated. The second task is for word alignment, we have no submission, however, we have the baseline system with precision of 0.83 and recall 0.7 with a maximum of 100 milliseconds match of the start/end times per word. The authors are planning to continue the Arabic multi-dialect challenge, using the current tasks and training data, and develop it further into dialectal speech processing in terms of both dialect detection and dialectal speech recognition."}, {"heading": "7.
