However, predicting the correct conjuncts span remain one of the biggest challenges for stateof-the-art syntactic parsers. Both the Berkeley and Zpar phrase-structure parsers (Petrov et al., 2006; Zhang and Clark, 2011) achieve F1 scores of around 69% when evaluated on their ability to recover coordination boundaries on the PTB test set. For example, in:\n\u201cHe has the government\u2019s blessing to [build churches] and [spread Unificationism] in that country.\u201d\nthe conjuncts are incorrectly predicted by both parsers:\nBerkeley: \u201cHe has the government\u2019s blessing to [build churches] and [spread Unificationism in that country].\u201d Zpar: \u201cHe [has the government\u2019s blessing to build churches] and [spread Unificationism in that country].\u201d\nIn this work we focus on coordination boundary prediction, and suggest a specialized model for this task. We treat it as a ranking task, and learn a scoring function over conjuncts candidates such that the correct candidate pair is scored above all other candidates. The scoring model is a neural network with two LSTM-based components, each modeling a different linguistic principle: (1) conjuncts tend to be similar (\u201csymmetry\u201d); and (2) replacing the coordination phrase with each of the conjuncts usually result in a coherent sentence (\u201creplacement\u201d). The symmetry component takes into account the conjuncts\u2019 syntactic structures, allowing to capture similarities that occur in different levels of the syntactic structure.\nThe replacement component considers the coherence of the sequence that is produced when connecting the participant parts. Both of these signals are syntactic in nature, and are learned solely based on information in the Penn Treebank. Our model substantially outperforms both the Berkeley and Zpar parsers on the coordination prediction task, while using the exact same training corpus. Semantic signals (which are likely to be based on resources external to the treebank) are also relevant for coordination disambiguation (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2008; Hogan, 2007) and provide complementary information.

These deficiencies led previous works on coordination disambiguation (Shimbo and Hara, 2007; Hara et al., 2009; Hanamoto et al., 2012) to use the Genia treebank of biomedical text (Ohta et al., 2002) which explicitly marks coordination phrases.

However, we do not know the similarity function. We approach this by training the similarity function in a data-dependent manner. Specifically, we train an encoder that encodes spans into vectors such that vectors of similar spans will have a small Euclidean distance between them. This architecture is similar to Siamese Networks, which are used for learning similarity functions in vision tasks (Chopra et al., 2005).\nVP\nVB cut NP PRP$\ntheir\nNNS risks\nVP\nVB take NP NNS\nprofits\nR VP VB cut cut V B V P R\nL VP R NP\nPRP$ their\ntheir PR P$ N P R V P L\nVP L NP NNS risks risks N N S N P L V P\nR VP VB take take V B V P R\nL VP NP NNS profits\nprofits N N S N P V P L\nEuclidean Distance\nFigure 2: Illustration of the symmetry scoring component that takes into account the conjuncts syntactic structures. Each conjunct tree is decomposed into paths that are fed into the path-LSTMs (squares). The resulting vectors are fed into the symmetry LSTM function (circles). The outcome vectors (blue circles) are then fed into the euclidean distance function.\nGiven two spans of lengths k and m with corresponding vector sequences u1:k and v1:m we encode each sequences using an LSTM, and take the euclidean distance between the resulting representations:\nSym(u1:k, v1:m) = ||LSTM(u1:k)\u2212 LSTM(v1:m)||\nThe network is trained such that the distance is minimized for compatible spans and large for incompatible ones in order to learn that vectors that represent correct conjuncts are closer than vectors that do not represent conjuncts.\nWhat are the elements in the sequences to be compared?\nOne choice is to take the vectors ui to correspond to embeddings of the ith POS in the span.\nThis approach works reasonably well, but does not consider the conjuncts\u2019 syntactic structure, which may be useful as symmetry often occurs on a higher level than POS tags. For example, in:\nNP\nNP\nNN\ntomorrow\nPP\nIN\nat\nCD\n16:00\nCC\nor\nNP\nNP\nNP\nthe day\nPP\nafter tomorrow\nPP\nIN\nat\nCD\n12:00\nthe similarity is more substantial in the third level of the tree than in the POS level.\nA way to allow the model access to higher levels of syntactic symmetry is to represent each word as the projection of the grammatical functions from the word to the root.2\nFor example, the projections for the first conjunct in Figure 2 are:\n2Similar in spirit to the spines used in Carreras et al. (2008) and Shen et al. (2003).\nVP\nVB\ncut\nVP\nNP\nPRP$\ntheir\nVP\nNP\nNNS\nrisks\nThis decomposition captures the syntactic context of each word, but does not uniquely determine the structure of the tree. To remedy this, we add to the paths special symbols, R and L, which marks the lowest common ancestors with the right and left words respectively.\nThese are added to the path above the corresponding nodes. For example consider the following paths which corresponds to the above syntactic structure:\nR\nVP\nVB\ncut\nL\nVP\nR\nNP\nPRP$\ntheir\nVP\nL\nNP\nNNS\nrisks\nThe lowest common ancestor of \u201ctheir\u201d and \u201crisks\u201d is NP. Thus, R is added after NP in the path of \u201ctheir\u201d and L is added after NP in the path of \u201crisks\u201d. Similarly, L and R are added after the VP in the \u201ctheir\u201d and \u201ccut\u201d paths.\nThe path for each word is encoded using an LSTM receiving vector embeddings of the elements in the path from the word to the root. We then use the resulting encodings instead of the POS-tag embeddings as input to the LSTMs in the similarity function.\nFigure 2 depicts the complete process for the spans \u201ccut their risks\u201d and \u201ctake profits\u201d.\nUsing syntactic projections requires the syntactic structures of the conjuncts. This is obtained by running the Berkeley parser over the sentence and taking the subtree with the highest probability from the\ncorresponding cell in the CKY chart.3 In both approaches, the POS embeddings are initialized with vectors that are pre-trained by running word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) on the POS sequences in PTB training set."}, {"heading": "4.2 The Replacement Component", "text": "The replacement component is based on the observation that, in many cases, the coordination phrase can be replaced with either one of its conjuncts while still preserving a grammatical and semantically coherent sentence (Section 2.2)\nWhen attempting such a replacement on incorrect conjuncts, the resulting sentence is likely to be either syntactically or semantically incorrect. For example, in the following erroneous analysis: \u201cRudolph Agnew, [55 years old] and [former chairman] of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC\u201d replacing the conjunction with the first conjunct results in the semantically incoherent sequence \u201cRudolph Agnew, 55 years old of Consolidated Golden Fields, PLC\u201d.4\nOur goal is to distinguish replacements resulting from correct conjuncts from those resulting from erroneous ones. To this end, we focus on the connection points. A connection point in a resulting sentence is the point where the sentence splits into two sequences that were not connected in the original sentence. For example, consider the sentence in Figure 3. It has four parts, marked as Pre, Conj1, Conj2 and Post. Replacing the coordination phrase Conj1 and Conj2 with Conj2 results in a connection point\n3The parser\u2019s CKY chart did not include a tree for 10% of the candidate spans, which have inside probability 0 and outside probability > 0. For those, we obtained the syntactic structure by running the parser on the span words only.\n4While uncommon, incorrect conjuncts may also result in valid sentences, e.g. \u201cHe paid $ 7 for cold [drinks] and [pizza] that just came out of the oven.\u201d\nbetween Pre and Conj2. Likewise, replacing the coordination phrase with Conj1 results in connection point between Conj1 and Post.\nIn order to model the validity of the connection points, we represent each connection point as the concatenation of a forward and reverse LSTMs centered around that point. Specifically, for the spans in Figure 3 the two connection points are represented as: LSTMF (Rudolph,...,old)\u25e6LSTMB(director,...,was,,) and LSTMF (Rudolph,Agnew,,)\u25e6LSTMB(director,...,former)\nFormally, assuming wordsw1:n in a sentence with coordination at position k and conjuncts wi:j and wl:m,5\nthe connection points are between w1:j and wm+1:n; and between w1:i\u22121 and wl:n. The two connection points representations are then concatenated, resulting in a replacement vector:\nREPL(w1:n, i, j, l,m) =\nCONPOINT(w1:n, i\u2212 1, l) \u25e6 CONPOINT(w1:n, j,m+ 1)\nwhere: CONPOINT(w1:n, i, j) =\nLSTMF (w1:i) \u25e6 LSTMB(wn:j)\nWe use two variants of the replacement vectors, corresponding to two levels of representation. The first variant is based on the sentence\u2019s words, while the second is based on its POS-tags."}, {"heading": "4.3 Parser based Features", "text": "In addition to the symmetry and replacement signals, we also incorporate some scores that are derived from the Berkeley parser. As detailed in Section 5, a list of conjuncts candidates are extracted\n5Usually j = k \u2212 1 and l = k + 1, but in some cases punctuation symbols may interfere.\nfrom the CKY chart of the parser. The candidates are then sorted in descending order according to the multiplication of inside and outside scores of the candidate\u2019s spans:6 I(i,j) \u00d7O(i,j) \u00d7 I(l,m) \u00d7O(l,m). Each candidate {(i, j), (l,m)} is assigned two numerical features based on this ranking: its position in the ranking, and the ratio between its score and the score of the adjacent higher-ranked candidate. We add an additional binary feature indicating whether the candidate spans are in the 1-best tree predicted by the parser. These three features are denoted as Feats(i, j, l,m)."}, {"heading": "4.4 Final Scoring and Training", "text": "Finally, the score of a candidate {(i, j), (l,m)} in a sentence with words w1:n and POS tags p1:n is computed as:\nSCORE(w1:n, p1:n, {(i, j), (l,m)}) = MLP (\nSym(vPathi:j , v Path l:m ) \u25e6Repl(w1:n, i, j, l,m) \u25e6Repl(p1:n, i, j, l,m) \u25e6 Feats(i, j, l,m) )\nwhere vPathi:j and v Path l:m are the vectors resulting from the path LSTMs, and Sym, Repl and Feats are the networks defined in Sections 4.1 \u2013 4.3 above.

Specifically, to obtain\n6Inside-Outside probabilities (Goodman, 1998) represent the probability of a span with a given non-terminal symbol. The inside probability I(N,i,j) is the probability of generating words wi, wi+1, ..., wj given that the root is the non-terminal N .

We then take as candidates all possible pairs of collected spans.\nOn the PTB dev set, this method produces 6.25 candidates for each coordinating word on average and includes the correct candidates for 94% of the coordinations.\nCoordination Classification We decide whether a coordination word wk in a sentence w1:n functions as a coordinator by feeding the biLSTM vector centered around wk into a logistic classifier: \u03c3(v \u00b7 biLSTM(w1:n, k) + b). The training examples are all the coordination words (marked with CC) in the PTB training set. The model achieves 99.46 F1 on development set and 99.19 F1 on test set.\nNP coordinations amount to about half of the coordination cases in the PTB, and previous work is often evaluated specifically on NP coordination. When evaluating on NP coordination, we depart from the unrealistic scenario used in most previous work where the type of coordination is assumed to be known a-priori, and train a specialized model for predicting the coordination type. For a coordination candidate {(i, j), (l,m)} with a coordinator wk, we predict if it is NP coordination or not by feeding a logistic classifier with a biLSTM vector centered around the coordinator and constrained to the candidate spans:\n\u03c3(v \u00b7 biLSTM(wi:m, k) + b). The training examples are coordinations in the PTB training set, where where a coordinator is considered of type NP if its head is labeled with NP or NX.

We convert predicted trees to conjunction predictions by taking the two phrases that are immediately adjacent to the coordinator on both sides (ignoring phrases that contain solely punctuation). For example, in the following Zparpredicted parse tree the conjunct prediction is (\u201cFeb. 8, 1990\u201d,\u201cMay 10, 1990\u201d).\nNP\nNP\nFeb. 8, 1990\nCC\nand\nNP\nMay 10, 1990\n,\n,\nADJP\nrespectively\nCases in which the coordination word is the leftmost or right-most non-punctuation element in its phrase (e.g. (PRN (P -)(CC and)(S it\u2019s been painful)(P -))) are considered as nocoordination (\u201cNone\u201d).\n8Another relevant model in the literature is (Hanamoto et al., 2012), however the results are not directly comparable as they use a slightly different definition of conjuncts, and evaluate on a subset of the Genia treebank, containing only trees that were properly converted to an HPSG formalism.\nWe consider two setups. In the first we are interested in all occurrences of coordination, and in the second we focus on NP coordination. The second scenario requires typed coordinations. We take the type of a parser-predicted coordination to be the type of the phrase immediately dominating the coordination word. Evaluation Metrics We measure precision and recall compared to the gold-annotated coordination spans in the extended PTB, where an example is considered correct if both conjunct boundaries match exactly. When focusing on NPs coordinations, the type of the phrase above the CC level must match as well, and phrases of type NP/NX are considered as NP coordination. Results Tables (1) and (2) summarize the results. The Berkeley and Zpar parsers perform similarly on the coordination prediction task. Our proposed model outperforms both parsers, with a test-set F1 score of 72.7 (3.78 F1 points gain over the better parser) when considering all coordinations, and testset F1 score of 76.1 (4.77 F1 points gain) when considering NP coordination."}, {"heading": "6.2 Evaluation on Genia", "text": "To compare our model to previous work, we evaluate also on the Genia treebank (Beta), a collection of constituency trees for 4529 sentences from Medline abstracts.

Figure 4 lists correct and incorrect predictions by each of the components, indicating that the individual models are indeed capturing the patterns they were designed to capture \u2013 though these patterns do not always lead to correct predictions."}, {"heading": "8 Related Work", "text": "The similarity property between conjuncts was explored in several previous works on coordination disambiguation. Hogan (2007) incorporated this principle in a generative parsing model by changing the generative process of coordinated NPs to condition on properties of the first conjunct when generating the second one.\nShimbo and Hara (2007) proposed a discriminative sequence alignment model to detect similar conjuncts. They focused on disambiguation of nonnested coordination based on the learned edit distance between two conjuncts. Their work was extended by Hara et al. (2009) to handle nested coordinations as well. The discriminative edit distance model in these works is similar in spirit to our symmetry component, but is restricted to sequences of POS-tags, and makes use of a sequence alignment algorithm. We compare our results to Hara et al.\u2019s in Section 6.2. Hanamoto et al. (2012) extended the previous method with dual decomposition and HPSG parsing. In contrast to these symmetry-directed efforts, Kawahara et al. (2008) focuses on the dependency relations that surround the conjuncts. This kind of semantic information provides an additional signal which is complementary to the syntactic signals explored in our work. Our neural-network based model easily supports incorporation of additional signals, and we plan to explore such semantic signals in future work."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusions", "text": "We presented an neural-network based model for resolving conjuncts boundaries. Our model is based on the observation that (a) conjuncts tend to be similar and (b) that replacing the coordination phrase with a conjunct results in a coherent sentence. Our models rely on syntactic information and do not incorporate resources external to the training treebanks, yet improve over state-of-the-art parsers on the coordination boundary prediction task."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by The Israeli Science Foundation (grant number 1555/15) as well as the German Research Foundation via the German-\nIsraeli Project Cooperation (DIP, grant DA 1600/1- 1)."}], "references": [{"title": "Bracketing guidelines for treebank ii style penn treebank project", "author": ["Bies et al.1995] Ann Bies", "Mark Ferguson", "Karen Katz", "Robert MacIntyre", "Victoria Tredinnick", "Grace Kim", "Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz", "Britta Schasberger"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "Bies et al\\.,? \\Q1995\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bies et al\\.", "year": 1995}, {"title": "Tag, dynamic programming, and the perceptron for efficient, feature-rich parsing", "author": ["Michael Collins", "Terry Koo"], "venue": "In Proceedings of the Twelfth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning,", "citeRegEx": "Carreras et al\\.,? \\Q2008\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Carreras et al\\.", "year": 2008}, {"title": "Learning a similarity metric discriminatively, with application to face verification", "author": ["Chopra et al.2005] Sumit Chopra", "Raia Hadsell", "Yann LeCun"], "venue": "In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,", "citeRegEx": "Chopra et al\\.,? \\Q2005\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Chopra et al\\.", "year": 2005}, {"title": "Type raising, functional composition, and non-constituent conjunction", "author": ["David Dowty"], "venue": "In Categorial grammars and natural language structures,", "citeRegEx": "Dowty.,? \\Q1988\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Dowty.", "year": 1988}, {"title": "Finding structure in time", "author": ["Jeffrey L Elman"], "venue": "Cognitive science,", "citeRegEx": "Elman.,? \\Q1990\\E", "shortCiteRegEx": "Elman.", "year": 1990}, {"title": "Coordination annotation extension in the penn tree bank.
