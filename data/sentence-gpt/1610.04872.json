INTRODUCTION\nThis year on a Monday morning Delta Airlines\u2019 operation came to a standstill [10]. Passengers check-in to the flights in London Heathrow were told that the flight check-in systems were not operational. The story was same across the globe during that time. Not only did this cause tremendous financial loss to Delta, it caused immense damage to Delta\u2019s brand. It turned out that the reason behind this outage was the failure of a critical power supply equipment, which caused a surge to the transformer and loss of power. The critical systems did not switch over to back up power. In other words, a power surge caused by single malfunctioning unit brought Delta\u2019s operation to a halt. One can find similar incidents caused by malfunctioning equipment across industries. Not only are data centers vulnerable due to sudden failure of equipment, so are other critical infrastructure such as electricity grids, utilities, airports etc.\nFailures such as the one in Delta, leads to root cause analysis and instituting capabilities to predict such failures. The progress of machine learning and analytics has possibility to tap the vast amount of data from sensors, equipment, factories and machines not only to monitor the health of the equipment but also to predict when something is likely to malfunction or fail. With the advent of huge data availability, a predictive and prescriptive analytics platform is an inseparable part of any analytics software. It is crucial to understand the possibility of future events to take precautionary measure to prevent unwanted situation hence cutting the operational and maintenance cost. Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) software, which monitors critical data center equipment, is also starting to utilize analytics capabilities to predict failures. At configuration stage, DCIM is mapped with the critical relationships and dependencies between all the assets, applications and business units in the data center. This makes it possible to identify cascading impacts of an impending failure. Over a period of time, data patterns evolve which lend themselves to modern predictive and prescriptive analytics. Predictive analytics gives the data center team\nenough time to take measures to either avoid or reduce the impact of the failure when it happens. [5] Players in the field of DCIM are advancing with their predictive technology giving health maps of devices, predicting downtime of a device based on past data, estimating the gap between forecasted values and real values in analysing alarms etc. [6, 7, 8].\nIt is imperative for data centers to keep uptime of the equipment to the maximum. This reduces the possibility of data center downtime. The various equipment in the data center such as UPS, PDUs, PACs are monitored by DCIM with real time alerts if critical parameters cross thresholds. The streaming data from devices as well as alerts and faults reports can be correlated by analytics to pin point root causes of failures as well as predict device failures. These aid immensely in streamlining data center operations.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows: Section II describes the complete objective of the research along with the problem definition. Section III discusses about related work and the novel contribution of this paper. Section IV elaborates the Proposed Fault Engine modules divided into several subsections. Section V presents the experimental setup and results. Section VI analyzes the time and space complexity of the proposed algorithms and finally section VII concludes the paper discussing its direct and derived business application tuned with scalability."}, {"heading": "II. PROBLEM STATEMENT AND OBJECTIVES", "text": "This paper contributes to a full stack design of predictive analytics platform in DCIM Software. The major contribution of this paper is as follows:\n\u2022 The model of a computing unit, Fault Engine, which leverages the log-data from all concerned devices available in the device chain and employs a Markov Process based Failure Model to predict\nwhether the failure is permanent or transient hence raising alarm with proper severity. It also indicates the recovery probability at any given time stamp after the failure has occurred.\n\u2022 The Engine identifies the root cause devices in a situation of failure. It assigns probability to devices to be a probable root cause hence narrows down the search space for the DC management team.\n\u2022 The Engine is capable of identifying communities of correlated devices based on the correlated failures."}, {"heading": "III. LITERATURE SURVEY", "text": "Though several previous work [8, 3, 17] discusses about the failure management in distributed system, but the integrated correlated alarm module with fault prediction is not reported in the literature yet, in our best knowledge. The Markov failure model have been reported in [18] with an assumption of exponential distribution which lacks to predict the time-dependent probability of recovery of a device at any instance after failure. The generalized assumption of Weibull distribution and its parameter estimation from available log data to enable the Fault Engine to predict the time dependent recovery probability at any time instance after the failure is indeed a meaningful extension of work [18]. Furthermore, the Bayesian probability assignment and topologically sorted list of probable root causes gives a unique flavor in terms of real-time implementation and inference making. The community detection algorithm have been discussed for several applications [19], but in our best knowledge, it never has been used in a network to cluster devices based correlated failure. The paper presents the complete implementation of Fault Engine in connection with middleware in DCIM software. The idea can be extended to any distributed system surveillance software to understand and predict the severity of a failure scenario. The complete model have been implemented for trial in the architecture of GFS Crane Software [11]."}, {"heading": "IV. FAULT ENGINE", "text": ""}, {"heading": "IV.A. Permanent and Transient Failure Detection using Markov Failure Model", "text": "DCIM Software allows the Alarm module to raise alarms for individual device when it exceeds the already set threshold for parameters of the device but it does not guarantee that the failure is permanent while raising alarms. At times, it is costly to tackle false alarms which are not indicating transient failures. Hence, it demands a robust and intelligent alarm module which is able to raise alarm based on severity of failure i.e. persistent or temporary failure.\nThe fault engine conceptualizes a Markov Model, prevalent in distributed system control [18] which assumes three state for each device. Three states are Active (A), Transient Failure (T) and Permanent Failure (P) (Figure 1). It is intuitive and evident that a device can transit from Active state to Transient Failure state, and vice versa. Also, the device can transit from Active state to Permanent Failure state. Other transitions are not possible. To model the Markov Process, it is sufficient to estimate these three transition probabilities. We define these transition probabilities as follows:\n\u2022 Probability of transition from A to T : \ud835\udefc\n\u2022 Probability of transition from T to A : \ud835\udefd\n\u2022 Probability of transition from A to P : \ud835\udefe\nThese three parameters correspond respectively to the mean time to failure (MTTF) (given that the failure is transient), the mean time to recovery (MTTR), and the mean life time (MLT) of the node. Particularly, \ud835\udefc = 1/\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc39, \ud835\udefd = 1/\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45, \ud835\udefe = 1/\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc47.\nWe define another variable called time to recovery (TTR) which defines number of time instances taken to be recovered from the failure. Hence \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc61) is the probability of a device being in the permanent failure state\ngiven \ud835\udc61 consecutive instances of failure have been observed. That is, \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f (\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 = \u221e | \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 \u2265 \ud835\udc61) is \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc61). We apply Bayes Theorem to derive the function G.\n\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 = \u221e | \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 \u2265 \ud835\udc61)\n= \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f (\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 = \u221e) \u2219 \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc5f( \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 \u2265 \ud835\udc61| \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 = \u221e)\n\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 = \u221e) \u2219 \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc5f( \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 \u2265 \ud835\udc61| \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 = \u221e) + \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 \u2260 \u221e) \u2219 \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc5f( \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 \u2265 \ud835\udc61| \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 \u2260 \u221e)\n= \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f (\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 = \u221e)\n\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 = \u221e) + \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 \u2260 \u221e) \u2219 \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc5f( \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 \u2265 \ud835\udc61| \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 \u2260 \u221e)\nIn calculation, \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 = \u221e) is the probability that a failure is a permanent failure. Since the failure transitions from state A has two competing transitions: one is to T with rate \ud835\udefc, and the other is to P with\nrate \ud835\udefe, \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 = \u221e ) = \ud835\udefe/(\ud835\udefe + \ud835\udefc). The Markov model failure and recovery behaviours of a node as a stochastic process with transition periods between different states of the node distributed as Weibull distribution. Weibull distribution is the most generalised version of exponential family. It is assumed that as the time progresses, the probability of failure increases for a device and hence Weibull distribution is a suitable match to capture that time dependency. The parameters of the distribution \ud835\udf06 (scale) and \ud835\udc58 (shape) can be estimated from the streaming data. Fig. 2 describes the distribution with different parameter values. Now, by substitution we get,\n\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udefe\n\ud835\udefe + \ud835\udefc. \ud835\udc52 \u2212( \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udf06 )\ud835\udc58\nFurthermore, even if \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc61) indicates the probability of a device to become transiently failed, it does not indicate the probability of recovery at time t given it failed at time 0. The probability that a device will recover at time \ud835\udc61\u2032, given it has observed \ud835\udc61 failures states (\ud835\udc61\u2032 > \ud835\udc61), can be obtained by the function \ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc61\u2019), as below:\n\ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc61\u2019) = \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 = \ud835\udc61\u2032, \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 \u2265 \ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc61 \u2265 \ud835\udc61\u2032|\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 \u2260 \u221e)\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 \u2265 \ud835\udc61|\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc45 \u2260 \u221e)\n\ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc61\u2019) = (\ud835\udc58/\ud835\udf06)(\n\ud835\udc61\u2032 \ud835\udf06 )\ud835\udc58\u22121 \u2219 \ud835\udc52 \u2212( \ud835\udc61\u2032 \ud835\udf06 )\ud835\udc58\n\ud835\udc52 \u2212( \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udf06\n)\ud835\udc58 , 0 < \ud835\udc58 < \u221e, 0 < \ud835\udf06 < \u221e\nThe above expression comes from the similar analogy of hazard function in the study of survival analysis. Once we have obtained a device as transiently failed, we can further estimate the probability from the distributional assumption using the Weibull probability distribution function. This consolidates the fact why Weibull distribution has been used in estimating \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc61) because in the simplest form i.e. in exponential (\ud835\udc58 = 1), \ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc61\u2019) will only depend upon the difference in \ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc61\u2019 which might not be the case. The memoryless property of exponential distribution fails to capture the information at time \ud835\udc61.\nFor example, if the lifetime of a router is 6 time periods, and it has failed at 4th time periods, then the probability of recovery in 5th time period would be very less. This information has been captured by using\nthe Weibull distribution, where the \ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc61\u2019) does not only depend on the time difference between \ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc61\u2019. Hence, as the time progresses, the probability of recovery will decreases i.e. the shape parameter \ud835\udc58 will be greater than 1. Fig. 2 indicates the asymptotical decreasing behaviour of recovery probability for \ud835\udc58 values greater than 1.\nThe bottleneck of this method is the estimation of distribution parameters for Weibull distribution from streaming data because the whole stream (or a reasonably large sample) is needed every time for parameter estimation which poses a high space complexity. To do away with this problem, the assumption of Weibull distribution can be relaxed and the simplest form of exponential distribution (\ud835\udc58 = 1) can be assumed. Then \ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc61) would look like:\n\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udefe\n\ud835\udefe + \ud835\udefc. \ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc61\nThe advantage of this model is that from an incoming data stream, it is convenient to calculate the mean ( 1\n\ud835\udefc ,\n1 \ud835\udefd , 1 \ud835\udefe ) without storing the whole data stream in the memory hence space efficient. But the tradeoff has been made in estimating the function \ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc61\u2019) which will be only dependent on the time difference of \ud835\udc61 and \ud835\udc61\u2019. The pseudocode is in table Algorithm 1 with the exponential distributional assumption of recovery behavior. The idea extends the work in [18] employing a more generalized version of stochastic recovery behavior. Along with that, it introduces a novel function \ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc61\u2019) from the analogy of hazard function which also estimate probability of recovery at an exact time point. The module has unique application in DCIM which helps to under the severity of failure and hence acts as an input into the next section of the engine. This module works in a local manner where device level probability has been calculated to detect the nature of failure which enables to generate alarm based on the severity of failure."}, {"heading": "IV.B. Root Cause Analysis using Polling and Trap", "text": "In an instance of failure, several devices can raise alarms depending on their status of availability irrespective of being the root cause of the failure. It is critical to identify the proper root cause, which minimizes operational cost and time of the DC Management team. DCIM software is usually capable of raising real time alarms on critical health devices but it is unable to justify the root cause of failure in a\nrobust and synchronized manner [2]. The Fault Engine deploys the middleware in polling and trapping from all standard IP protocol (e.g. SNMP/MODBUS) enabled devices in every time instance set by the user in a synchronized manner [9]. A data center consists of several devices, mostly IP Protocol enabled, i.e. remotely accessible. Starting from the power station, all the devices create an acyclic chain or directed dependency graph where each device is a node and there is an edge between two nodes if they are physically/electrically connected with a direction towards the power/information flow. We assume the whole graph is acyclic i.e. there is no directed cycle in the graph. Also, in practical it is possible to have devices which is connected to dummy power supply to reduce possible link failure of its parent. Hence, we assume a node can have more than one parent. If one device fails, all of its dependent devices will eventually fail (except dummy parent cases). Fig. 3 describes a sample directed dependency network for different devices in the Data Center. We have considered all devices sending alarm as faulty as well as all the devices that are not reachable by polling-trap. Our goal of this module to allow the Fault Engine to know about the probability of a device to be actually faulty. We apply Bayesian rule to decide for device of being faulty given some its dependent is sending alarm or failed.

The conditional probability of sending alarm for a device given some other device is failed is an identity function \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc57, i.e. \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc57 = 0 if \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 is the parent of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc57, 0 otherwise. Thus we find out the conditional probability of being faulty for a device given all of its dependent devices sending alarm. All the probabilities for a particular device have been aggregated and divided by the total number of dependent devices are sending alarm and finally the mean conditional probability could be calculated for all faulty devices.\n\u2018 ; where \ud835\udc5b\u2019 is total direct or indirect alarming children of \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\nIt is evident as we describe from the dependency structure and from the sample figure that a device resides in upper hierarchy is more critical as a root cause of failure than the ones reside in the lower part of the network. Hence, the Fault Engine is able to sort all the devices topologically from the acyclic directed dependency graph which gives a decreasing order of importance of devices. The engine further assigns the conditional probability calculated for each faulty device and a second level sorting had been done based on probability where the hierarchical level of two devices is same. The order given by this module narrows down the search space of devices to a collection of probable root cause. The pseudocode of the algorithm is given in Algorithm 2 table. The marginal and conditional probability update can be done in any instance with the use of streaming data without storing the whole data chain."}, {"heading": "IV.C. Root Cause Analysis with Correlated Alarm System", "text": "This extension of this previous module employs clustering between devices based on their correlated failures. The Fault Engine employs all the conditional probabilities given all other devices from the historical data to identify the correlation between devices based on their correlated failures. It is easy to understand the correlation in terms of failure among the nodes in one cluster hence the user will have information about the probability of other nodes from the same cluster of being the root cause.\nAn undirected graph have been constituted with all devices as nodes where the measure of conditional probability that probability of one node sends an alarm given the other node also sends an alarm, will act as an edge weight between these two nodes in question in this similarity graph of all devices. The engine operationalizes a community detection algorithm named Girvan-Newman method [16] in this new weighted similarity graph to identify the clusters or communities of devices which are highly correlated in a failure scenario.\nGirvan Newman is widely popular community detection algorithm which calculates the edge betweenness [12] of the graph and simply removes the edges having highest edge betweenness. It also optimizes the modularity function of the network given the cut as the objective function hence obtains fairly optimal clustering. Practically, the clustering algorithm targets to find clusters where one member raises alarm whenever another member from same cluster raises alarm. The advantage of this extension from previous module is the engine do not need to run the sorting over all the nodes. Whenever, in an instance of failure, a device alarms, the engine can deploy the sorting in between the cluster the alarming node belongs to. The clustering can be done offline or low-load scenario with a time interval and hence provides additional knowledge about the node failures during online. The fast implementation and integration of this module enhance the chance of identifying the right root cause very quickly when a failure happens. The Algorithm 3 follows the full description of this module.\nIV.D. Integration with Middleware \u2013 The Technology Stack\nIt is important to seamlessly integrate all of the three modules and prepare a technology stack which sequentially performs the required task by three of these modules. Usually, all the log data are stored in Database which can be directly accessed by the middleware present in the system. Any DCIM software will possess an alarm module, be it separate or not, also can communicate with the middleware. We propose, the Fault Engine should be pushed in between the middleware and Alarm module. The Fault Engine doesn\u2019t require to directly access the databases due to security reason hence middleware can facilitate the information flow. Since Alarm module is just a record of all alarms in different faulty situations, Fault Engine needs to access the information. The marginal and conditional failure probability calculation requires the alarm log data along with parameter estimation also happens in the help of failure time stamp data. The polling-trap facility is available through middleware hence root-cause analysis can be done using proper information. The following diagram in Fig. 3 indicates the proposed stack design.\nThis concludes the operation of Fault Engine which sequentially runs the Markov model to determine the persistence of a failure in a local level, i.e. per device along with determining and then a global level graph clustering algorithm to detect clusters of device of correlated failure and then sorts all the devices inside a cluster topologically based on the directed dependence available in the DCIM power chain. The Fault Engine can be integrated between middleware and the alarm module to interact with both of them (Fig. 3)."}, {"heading": "V. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND RESULTS", "text": "Most of the DCIM software do not store the data of actual root cause when they are detected with manual supervision [11]. The predictive system has not been included any of the DCIM software, as per our best knowledge. We have set up an experimental design with the technical expertise from Greenfield Software, a leading DCIM software company. We have developed a power chain consisting 47 devices acting as nodes. (Fig. 4). The network represents a generic power chain [11] in DCIM. The directed graph in the figure shows the hierarchy or precedence of the devices in order to be in chain. The higher order denotes more critical to the chain. We analyzed a case of PDU failure due to input power surge. The alarm logs have been generated for all devices below PDU2 according to real life case observed in GFS DCIM software. For all other devices, the overall error log to calculate the marginal error probability has been generated assuming exponential distribution. With practical consideration, we have assumed more than 25 failed log will indicate the permanent failure. Let us assume, 15 time stamps have been elapsed after the failure occurred in the PDU2 in the network of Fig. 4. Fig 5 shows the Weibull fit on the recovery time of PDU2 from its error log file. The estimated parameter have been reported as: \ud835\udc58 = 2.43, \ud835\udf06 = 4.69. Similarly, the parameters of the Weibull distribution for all individual devices have been estimated from their respective sample error logs.\nAmong PDU2 and its direct and children, PDU2, Rack2, Server6 and Router5 has showed non zero and high probability (0.8234, 0.7862, 0.7103 and 0.8165) of being permanently failure. We applied Root Cause analysis on these affected devices and the representative result shows particular racks (Rack2) has more probability of being the root cause than router in the given scenario as indicated by Fig. 6 (size of the node denotes its severity of failure). Also network has been segmented into 4 clusters based on their likelihood of being fail simultaneously or in correlated manner as indicated in Fig. 7. It is evident from the result that PDU2 and Rack2 falls in the same cluster. This clustering will certainly help in identifying related devices failure simultaneously.\nThe above experiment gave indication of the correctness of the result. To be certain about the scalability of the modules, we ran all of them sequentially on different size of the network having total nodes 50, 500, 5000, 12000, 50000, 100000. For all cases, the marginal error probabilities have been generated using exponential distribution with various values of the parameter. The next section reports the complexity and scalability of the modules based on this extended experiment."}, {"heading": "VI. TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS", "text": "We present a brief complexity analysis of all the algorithm which will indicate its applicability in DCIM software.\nTime complexity of Markov Failure model for computing transient probability of a failed device is linear\nin the size of the system log file of the device. Hence, for each of the faulty devices (devices that are showing\nfault on their current log), the time complexity for fitting the Weibull distribution takes \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc3e) time (\ud835\udc3e is\nthe size of the logfile which is equivalent to the time elapsed \ud835\udc61), whereas, other constants like MTTF, MTTR\nand MLT can be computed in \ud835\udc42(1) from the streaming data. As the whole log file has been stored, the\nspace complexity is also \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc3e). Both time and space complexity can further be reduced to \ud835\udc42(1) with the use of streaming data, if we use non parametric failure models instead of any parametric distributional\nforms. But non parametric implementation cannot produce future failure rate predictions, which might be\nvery crucial and vital for some practical scenarios. Fig. 8 shows the system and user runtime for the Markov\nFailure module which indicates almost constant over number of nodes in the network.\nIn the Root Cause Analysis module, the initialization takes \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc5b) time to generate the graph with \ud835\udc5a devices and \ud835\udc5b edges. For a sparse graph like power/information chain dependency graph we often observe that\n\ud835\udc5a ~ \ud835\udc5b. Using the serial computation, topological sort takes \ud835\udee9(\ud835\udc5b + \ud835\udc5a) time [13], which is asymptotically same as \ud835\udee9(\ud835\udc5a). This complexity can be reduced to \ud835\udee9(\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc542 \ud835\udc5a) by using parallel computers of \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc58) number of processors. There are many implementations available viz. Floyd-Warshall [4], Thorup [15], Kameda\u2019s algorithm [14] for calculating all pair reachability in a network. Our implementation using Kameda\u2019s algorithm takes \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc5a) preprocessing time as \ud835\udc42(1) time for each reachability query. The required calculation on the historical fault log takes \ud835\udee9(\ud835\udc3e) time, where \ud835\udc3e is the size of the fault log; \ud835\udc3e \u220a \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc61 \u2217 \ud835\udc5a), where \ud835\udc61 is the time elapsed. Finally, the step for calculating Bayesian probability for each of the \ud835\udc53 number of probable faulty devices for each of the \ud835\udc4e number of alarming devices takes \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc53 \u2217 \ud835\udc4e \u2217 \ud835\udc5a) time. Accumulating all the steps, we compute the running time of our root cause calculation algorithm to be \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc5a + \ud835\udc61 \u2217 \ud835\udc5a + \ud835\udc53 \u2217 \ud835\udc4e \u2217 \ud835\udc5a). Similarly, the space requirement can be calculated to be \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc5a2 + \ud835\udc61 \u2217 \ud835\udc5a). Fig. 9 indicates system runtime and user runtime taken with increasing number of devices in the network. As it shows, with 1 Lakh devices, the algorithm takes ~ 3 minutes to find the probable root causes. This can be reduced further if Root cause analysis is done on correlated cluster, where number of nodes in a cluster will be much less than the total size of the network. Even with 20,000 devices, the algorithm could output probable root causes within a minute.\nThe algorithm finding correlated failure cluster takes \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc5a3) preprocessing time for calculating the undirected weighted fault dependence graph, as for each pair of vertices, we calculate the Bayesian probability of failure. The Girvan-Newman community detection algorithm [16] takes \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc5b \u2217 \ud835\udc5a2) time to produce the community structure among the devices. This time heavy process can be substituted by some faster implementations namely Clauset-Newman-Moore [1], which takes \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc5a \u2217 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc542\ud835\udc5a) time for a sparse graph with \ud835\udc5a nodes. Hence, combining these two steps, the clustering implementation takes \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc5a3) time to produce the cluster of correlated devices based on their Bayesian failure probability for the network graph with \ud835\udc5a devices. Fig. 10 shows the user runtime almost follows a cubic curve with increasing number of nodes in network. Particularly this algorithm doesn\u2019t store any additional value hence the space complexity for this algorithm is nothing though the space taken by the graph is \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc5a2)."}, {"heading": "VII. BUSINESS IMPORTANCE AND CONCLUSION", "text": "Delta\u2019s outage and similar outages across critical infrastructure have reinforced the need to predict failure before it happens.
