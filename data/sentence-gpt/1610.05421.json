INTRODUCTION\nRECENTLY, great attention has been directed towardproviding Location Based Services (LBS) [1] as the next generation of health care monitoring [2], [3] and content delivery services such as network management and security [4], personalized information delivery [5], and context awareness [6]. Although these services are quite widespread for outdoor environments, challenges still exist indoors. These challenges primarily occur because there is no established localizationsupporting infrastructure for indoor environments like the well-known Global Positioning System (GPS) for outdoors [7].\nAlthough the user\u2019s location can be enabled with the aid of proximity RF sensors [8], [9], existing RF infrastructures such as Bluetooth [10], infrared transceivers [11], visible light [12], or even acoustic signals [13], the cost of the necessary infrastructure for each building has prevented the proliferation of these approaches. Hence, attention has been directed toward existing infrastructures like Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) which are densely deployed indoors [14]\u2013[16].\nManuscript received on March 6, 2016; revised May 9, 2016 and August, 10, 2016.

In fingerprinting, the area is divided into several, usually equidistant, grid points also known as Reference Points (RPs). The localization approach has two phases: offline and online. In the offline phase, the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of the available Access Points (APs) is recorded at each RP. The set of fingerprints (location, RSS) for the whole area is called the radio map of the area. In the online phase, the user receives the RSS measurements from available APs and a rule, called localization scheme, defines the relation between the online measurements and the radio map and estimates the user\u2019s location. In other words, the task of a fingerprint positioning system is to estimate the position of the user through a comparison mechanism between the online measurement and the radio map.\nWLAN localization faces several problems. In particular, the RSS fingerprints are prone to random fluctuations during the fingerprinting phase, and inference of distance from the estimated attenuation is not accurate. The complex indoor environment renders a multipath RSS profile due to the presence of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation with obstacles such as furnitures, doors, walls, etc. [24], [25]. Besides, RSS profiles show higher variance in short distances to APs [30].\nMotivated by the above problems, most of the modern approaches include the following four steps: 1) radio map preprocessing, where the radio map is processed in the offline phase to extract specific features from fingerprints, while clustering of RPs may also be performed [18], [22]; 2) coarse localization, in which a sub-region consisting of a subset of RPs that include the user\u2019s position is identified [22]; 3) AP selection, whereby a subset of available APs is chosen which can better differentiate between the RPs and introduces less biased readings [27], [36]; 4) fine localization where the user\u2019s location is estimated through a rule between the user\u2019s online measurements and radio map."}, {"heading": "II. STATE-OF-THE-ART WLAN FINGERPRINTING LOCALIZATION: RELATED WORK AND CHALLENGES", "text": "In this section, main categories of fingerprinting localization approaches are reviewed followed by a discussion of existing challenges.\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n05 42\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.N I]\n1 8\nO ct\n2 01\n6"}, {"heading": "A. Related Work", "text": "The state-of-the-art localization approaches are divided into three broad categories mainly based on their fine localization methods: 1) probabilistic approaches which estimate the user\u2019s location based on statistical methods such as Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) [18], Conditional Random Fields (CRF) [31], KL-divergence [32], Dynamic Hybrid Projection (DHP) [29]; 2) pattern recognition schemes such as Support-Vector Machines (SVM) [37], [38]; and 3) deterministic methods which rely on a distance metric between online measurements and radio map fingerprints. Deterministic approaches are divided into Nearest Neighbor (NN) [39]\u2013[42], geometry-based localization [33]\u2013[35], and Compressive Sensing (CS) methods [21], [22].\nThe CS method formulates the localization as the solution to a set of linear equations. The radio map becomes the coefficient matrix, the user\u2019s online measurement is the observation vector, and user\u2019s location vector is the unknown vector to be estimated. The user can be only in one position at any single time and hence, the user\u2019s location vector is considered as a 1- sparse vector in which only the entry corresponding to the RP closest to the user location is 1 and the remaining entries are zero. The solution to a linear system of equations where the unknown vector is sparse can be obtained through an `1-norm minimization rather than a simple pseudo-inverse solution.\nWLAN localization methods can be enhanced by combining them with other positioning sources. For example, recent works reported such hybrid integrations with dead-reckoning, which is a method that uses the internal sensors of the hand-held devices, such as accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope [46]. These methods exploit the spatial pattern of the fingerprints and fuse them with the the user\u2019s trajectory estimated from the sensors [47]\u2013[50]. While hybrid solutions are out of scope of this paper, the methods described can be used in hybrid solutions as well."}, {"heading": "B. Challenges in Indoor WLAN Fingerprinting Localization: Outliers and Radio Map Construction", "text": "Although CS-based localization is one of the most prominent fingerprinting positioning systems, it still suffers from several drawbacks. The CS-based method requires that the radio map matrix satisfies certain properties to render a unique solution [43], [44]. As a result, the radio map matrix needs an orthogonalization preprocessing, which may not work well numerically, because the radio map is a fat matrix. The orthogonalization step is also an extra step that increases computational complexity. Also, the CS approach assumes noiseless online RSS measurements and tries to find a position vector that matches the fingerprints exactly. However, online measurements cannot match exactly with the fingerprints of an RP. Furthermore, coarse localization should be applied before the fine localization step. This is an extra step and if it fails, it leads to a wrong subset of RPs and the entire localization fails [22], [23], [45].\nIn addition, localization approaches may experience the unavailability of APs due to unforeseen reasons. For example, a set of APs may be lost due to natural disasters. In these\ncases, only a small number of APs usually remain functional. Online measurements deviate considerably from radio map fingerprints, and thus a localization system should be able to deliver the location of the user using only a subset of available APs. WLANs are dynamic systems that experience rapid changes not only due to the AP software, but due to infrastructure changes such as removal of APs, malfunctions, jamming, intermittent shutting down of APs, or intentional adversary attacks that may weaken or strengthen the AP signals. In such cases, online readings of APs are not trustable. These inordinate readings are called outliers, an issue that has surprisingly received little attention.\nAnother challenge is related to the radio map construction and updating. On one hand, any changes in the environment such as AP relocation, structural changes, and equipment moving, change the characteristics of the environment. The radio map must be thus regularly updated. On the other hand, fine grained localization requires dense RP fingerprinting which takes a long time and incurs high labor costs. Therefore, some recent methods have been directed toward coarse fingerprinting and radio map interpolation on a fine grid of RPs [22], [51]\u2013[53]. Finally, while preventative measures including longtime fingerprinting, validation, and attack detection have been proposed before [54], the problem of radio map interpolation when the actual readings also contain outliers has not been addressed so far."}, {"heading": "III. CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS PAPER", "text": "The contributions of this paper are threefold and amount to novel schemes respectively for indoor WLAN localization, outlier detection, and radio map interpolation using (group) sparse recovery techniques.\n1) Group Sparsity-based Localization Method: This paper proposes a new WLAN fingerprinting localization approach that comprises three steps, in the online phase: 1) RP grouping; 2) AP selection; and 3) localization through group sparse regression. These steps and their merits are described next.\nThe first step entails computing the similarity between the online measurement and each RP fingerprint via an AP coverage vector. This similarity is the Hamming distance between the most available APs in the radio map. The most available APs are defined as those whose readings are above a specific threshold in most of the fingerprinting time. These similarities are used to group the RPs. These groups participate in localization through corresponding weights which are proportional to the inverse of the average group Hamming distance.\nIn the second step, the number of APs engaged in localization is reduced through the conventional AP selection methods based on either the strongest set of APs [17], [55], which provide enlarged network coverage most of the time, or the Fisher Criterion [17], [19], [56]. The latter is one of the most reliable AP selection methods and takes the fingerprinting history of the AP into account [18].\nThe last step is the user location estimation performed through Group-Sparsity (GS)-based regression. We introduce a model that better reflects the relation between the RSS\nfingerprints, online measurements, user\u2019s location, and noise, which models the components that cannot be explicitly defined. The user location is estimated through the GS-based minimization which addresses the previously mentioned challenges and comprises a multi-objective optimization problem. The optimization chooses the RP fingerprints that minimize the difference between the radio map and online measurement, gives the opportunity to all RPs to engage in localization, and provides a sparse user\u2019s location. These objectives participate in the minimization problem through their corresponding tuning parameters.\nDifferent from the CS-based approach, the new method has the following advantages: 1) There is no need for coarse localization as the two-step procedure of coarse localization followed by fine localization is not necessarily optimal. 2) Our solution utilizes all RPs in a single step localization, which does not suffer from the issue of potential error in coarse localization. 3) There is no need for preprocessing of the radio map (e.g., orthogonalization of the regression matrix). 4) The method is naturally tailored to noisy measurements, as the residuals are minimized instead of attempting to exactly match the online measurement to a fingerprint.\n2) Outlier Detection: A modified formulation of the GSbased localization system to account for outliers in the online phase is introduced. Basically, outliers model large errors in the online measurements or unavailable measurements from APs that were present in the fingerprinting phase. The main idea is that the outliers are explicitly modeled as an unknown vector, which may be efficiently recovered because it is sparse. Explicit modeling of outliers has been pursued in the statistics literature [57], but this is the first time that it is being incorporated in GS-based WLAN localization. Specifically, the new approach detects the APs with outliers, and performs the localization with clean online measurements. The location of the user and the outliers of APs are jointly estimated through a single optimization problem.\n3) Radio Map Interpolation: Motivated by the fact that fingerprinting is time consuming and incurs high labor cost, this paper develops an additional sparse recovery formulation that is able to interpolate between RPs. The radio map fingerprints can be recorded at a smaller number of RPs (coarser granularity) while finer granularity can be achieved through interpolation of fingerprints between RPs. We additionally tackle the problem of the radio map interpolation when readings contain outliers by augmenting the radio map interpolation scheme with an outlier detection component so that outliers have little effect on interpolation.\nIn summary, we formulate various aspects of WLAN localization leveraging group sparsity regression and optimization techniques. In the remainder of this paper, the offline radio map construction is described in Section IV. The localization scheme and online RP layered clustering method are introduced in Section V. Section VI describes the augmented localization model which jointly estimates the location and outliers. In Section VII, the radio map interpolation scheme is developed.

Group Sparsity-Based Localization", "text": "The main idea of the proposed localization scheme is to efficiently combine coarse and fine localization into a single step. The localization is thus performed by solving an optimization problem that combines the following objectives:\n\u2022 Minimization of the squared `2-norm of the residuals between the radio map and online measurements. \u2022 Recovery of a sparse vector of the user\u2019s location via minimization of the `1-norm of the entire user\u2019s position vector. \u2022 Participation of all RPs in location estimation by accounting for the RP groups and their corresponding weights found in the first step (layered clustering). This is the group sparsity component and is expressed as a summation of the `2-norms of groups of RPs. This component shrinks the non-zero elements of the position vector to a single group.\nTo this end, the GS-based localization is given by\n\u03b8\u0302 = argmin \u03b8\n[ 1\n2 \u2016y \u2212H\u03b8\u201622 + \u03bb1\u2016\u03b8\u20161 + \u03bb2 K\u2211 k=1 wk\u2016\u03b8k\u20162 ] (4)\nwhere H = \u03a6\u03a8, \u03b8k is a part of location vector \u03b8 that contains the indices of the RPs corresponding to group k, wk is the weight assigned to group k, K is the total number of groups, and \u03bb1, \u03bb2 \u2265 0 are tuning parameters. The first argument minimizes the possible impact of online measurement noise considering that the RSS fingerprint noises have already been minimized through time-averaging of the fingerprints as described in Section IV. The second component promotes sparsity in the position vector \u03b8. The last term provides the sparsity over the groups (clusters) so that the recovered vector\u2019s nonzero elements are concentrated within a single group. This term basically plays the role of coarse localization. This minimization is known as Sparse Group Lasso (SGL) [58], and its custom solvers are available [59]. It is applied to WLAN positioning in this paper for the first time.\nThe difference between the proposed GS-based and CSbased localization method is as follows:\n1) The CS approach does not follow model (3) and does not take the noise into account. The GS is expected to have\nbetter performance in terms of localization accuracy because it considers the component in the model. More specifically, the objective \u2016y \u2212H\u03b8\u201622 minimizes the difference between the radio map fingerprints and the online measurements.\n2) Another reason that group Lasso is expected to have better performance is that it is not restricted to choosing a subset of clusters, but all clusters participate in the fine localization. In other words, we have combined the coarse and fine localization stages into a single optimization.\n3) The coarse localization is an extra pre-processing step that increases the computational complexity of the whole localization approach. However, using all the clusters in GS method, there is no need for any coarse localization.\n4) Another feature is the pre-processing steps that are required for the CS-based localization. In order to recover a unique sparse solution, the regression matrix needs to obey the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) and mutual coherence conditions. For this reason, the radio map must be orthogonalized before solving the optimization problem which is not always workable as the matrix is not square. However, in our method, the solution takes advantage of any correlation between the radio map columns and does not need any pre-processing step.\nAlthough formulation (4) is general and can use any subset of RP groups, a new clustering method is developed in the next subsection."}, {"heading": "C. Online Layered Clustering", "text": "In this subsection, we propose a new method to define the groups of RPs and their corresponding weights. This method is summarized in Algorithm 1, and is described next in detail.\nFirst, define the AP coverage vector for the radio map as Ij = [ I1j , . . . , I L j ] , where Iij = 1 if AP i provides continuous coverage at pj and is 0 otherwise. An AP provides continuous coverage at pj if its fingerprints are above a threshold \u03b3 for 90 percent of the time samples [18]. Similarly, for online vector y, the coverage vector Iy has its i-th entry set to 1 if the online measurement from AP i is above \u03b3, and zero otherwise. The Hamming distance between two binary vectors Iy and Ij is used to indicate the number of APs with different coverage (lines 1-3 of Algorithm 1)\ndH(Iy, Ij) = L\u2211 i=1 |Iiy \u2212 Iij |, j \u2208 {1, . . . , N}.

We define the minimum and maximum of the Hamming distance over the area as (lines 4, 5 of Algorithm 1)\ndminH = min j=1,...,N dH(Iy, Ij) dmaxH = max j=1,...,N dH(Iy, Ij).

AP Selection", "text": "Since WLANs are designed to provide the maximum network coverage over the area, the number of available APs in an area is much greater than that required for positioning. Also, not all APs are suitable for positioning as the ones with high variance introduce large errors and lead to biased estimations. This motivates us to engage a set of APs in the localization that can efficiently represent the characteristics of the environment.\nIn our work, we have considered two AP selection methods: \u2022 Strongest APs Selection: In this method, we consider the\nset of APs whose online readings are above a predefined threshold.

If AP readings contain outliers, penalizing `1-norm of location vector alone does not guarantee outlier rejection and positioning suffers dramatically from large localization errors.\nAccording to the above discussion, outliers can be integrated in our previous sparsity-based localization model (3) as\ny = \u03a6\u03a8\u03b8 + \u03ba+ (15)\nwhere \u03ba is a vector indicating the outliers and is sparse because the number of APs that may contain outliers is small.\nHence, \u03ba can be jointly estimated with the user location vector using an `1-norm regularization.\nThe modified Group-Sparsity (MGS)-based minimization of (4) can be represented as\n(\u03b8\u0302, \u03ba\u0302) = argmin \u03b8,\u03ba\n[ 1\n2 \u2016y \u2212H\u03b8 \u2212 \u03ba\u201622 + \u03bb1\u2016\u03b8\u20161 + P\u03b1 ] P\u03b1 = \u03bb2\nK\u2211 k=1 wk\u2016\u03b8k\u20162 + \u03bb3\u2016\u03ba\u20161. (16)\nThe outlier vector \u03ba enables the optimization (16) to discard the outliers and find the user\u2019s location with the cleaned measurements. In essence, \u03ba absorbs significant deviations from fingerprints. Optimization (16) amounts to a second order cone program, which can be efficiently solved [60], [61]."}, {"heading": "VII. RADIO MAP INTERPOLATION USING SPARSE RECOVERY", "text": "In this section, we first formulate the interpolation of radio map using its sparse frequency equivalent and introduce our interpolation scheme. Then, we discuss the interpolation of the radio map if the measured fingerprints also contain outliers.\nA. Interpolation Procedure Formulation\nThe RSS fingerprints can be interpolated at some RPs if we measure the radio map at other RPs. In other words, the radio map fingerprints can be collected at coarser granularity and the RSS fingerprints can be estimated at a denser granularity through interpolating the radio map between RPs. Fig. 2 shows the RSS profile for a single AP over 192 RPs. This shows the smoothness of the profile and a suitable potential for interpolating the magnitudes of some RPs from their adjacent RPs. Fig. 3 also represents the frequency representation of the RSS profile. This representation shows the very sparse feature of fingerprints which can be utilized for sparse reconstruction (interpolation).\nThe sparse recovery can also be used in the offline phase to reconstruct the radio map from a lower number of RSS fingerprints. Let F be the N \u00d7 N Fourier transform matrix that linearly transforms the vector of radio map fingerprints to its equivalent representation in the frequency domain as\n\u03c8if = F\u03c8 i, i = 1, . . . , L. (17)\nThe representation of \u03c8if is sparse which means most of the frequency components are zero\u2014see e.g., [22]\u2014and our empirical evidence also confirms it. This observation helps us reconstruct the radio map in the subsequent discussions. Then, consider a matrix that defines the relation between all RPs and the ones that we have taken the fingerprints over. To this end, we define a matrix AV\u00d7N whose rows are 1-sparse vectors ai = [0, . . . , 1, . . . , 0] denoting the index of the RP that is measured during radio map fingerprinting, and V is the total number of these RPs. In essence, A selects the RPs in which we record actual fingerprints.\nThe model for the offline radio map interpolation for AP i can be represented as\nbi = A\u03c8i = AF\u22121\u03c8if , i = 1, . . . , L. (18)\nEquation (18) is an under-determined system of equations because V < N . However, since \u03c8if is sparse, a unique solution exists for it. To find the unique solution for (18), we propose a special case of the group sparse recovery formulation as\n\u03c8\u0302if = argmin \u03c8if\n[ 1\n2 \u2016bi \u2212AF\u22121\u03c8if\u201622 + \u03bb1\u2016\u03c8if\u20161\n] (19)\nwhich has the form of the group sparse recovery (4) with \u03bb2 = 0. This reformulated minimization problem is known as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). The above formulation minimizes the error between the measured RSS fingerprints and the interpolated fingerprints, while\nthe second term provokes sparsity of the RSS fingerprints in the Fourier domain.\nThe previous optimization is solved for all APs. The reconstructed radio map rows are computed as\n\u03c8\u0302i = F\u22121\u03c8\u0302if (20)\nwhere \u03c8\u0302i is the reconstructed radio map for AP i. Using (19), RSS fingerprints can be measured on a smaller number of RPs, and the radio map is interpolated in between RPs for a finer granularity.\nIn the interpolation, some RPs are skipped and choosing a selection order for faithful radio map reconstruction is a problem discussed in Appendix. For the rest of this paper, the interpolation will be used on random selection of RPs.\nB. Interpolation with Radio Map Outliers\nIn Section VI, we discussed the outlier detection for the user\u2019s online measurement vector. The outliers may also happen in the offline phase for radio map fingerprints. If the radio map is interpolated in the offline phase and the APs whose RSS fingerprints are recorded contain outliers at specific RPs, the interpolation procedure should also contain an outlier detection scheme. The extension of (18) to include outliers is as follows:\nbi = A\u03c8i + \u03ba = AF\u22121\u03c8if + \u03ba, i = 1, . . . , L. (21)\nBased on the previous model, the modified radio map reconstruction scheme which contains the outlier detection component is\n(\u03c8\u0302if , \u03ba\u0302) = argmin \u03c8if ,\u03ba\n[ 1\n2 \u2016bi \u2212AF\u22121\u03c8if \u2212 \u03ba\u201622 + P\u03b1 ] P\u03b1 = \u03bb1\u2016\u03c8if\u20161 + \u03bb2\u2016\u03ba\u20161. (22)\nThe above minimization reduces the effect of outlier for AP i by detecting the outlier, while interpolating between RPs with clean measurements."}, {"heading": "VIII.

To the best of our knowledge, the device has a delay in updating the NIC card and thus, the sampling intervals cannot be set to small values. We set the application to read the NIC once per second to ensure obtaining the updated RSS values. The device also records the Media Access Control (MAC) address of each AP along with its RSS magnitude."}, {"heading": "B. Fingerprinting Setup", "text": "The fingerprints have been collected from the second floor of the Applied Engineering Technology (AET) building with an area of 576 ft \u00d7 35 ft, and Biotechnology Sciences and Engineering (BSE) building with an area of 114 ft \u00d7 347 ft, both at the University of Texas at San Antonio which are comparable to those reported in [18], [22]. Fig. 4 shows the map of the AET second floor in which the green dots depict the fingerprinting locations. The building features a representative indoor office environment with complex wireless propagation patterns due to research labs, offices, a library, and study areas, and has a high commuting volume. The BSE floor is structurally different from that of AET as it contains labs, offices, conference rooms, wide open hall, and a cafeteria.\nThe WiFi signals lack the ability to exactly differentiate between points. So, a dense granularity leads to unnecessary and inefficient redundancy while a wide granularity leads to a low localization precision. Although existing methods set the RP spacing to 5-9 ft, we found 3 ft to be a sound grid spacing.\nDuring fingerprinting, a total of L = 268 different MAC addresses were visible at AET while the device could read L = 1238 different MAC addresses at BSE building. The MAC addresses were used as the unique identifiers of available APs. The fingerprints have been collected over three weeks during office hours to be representative of the APs RSS variations.\nThe localization results in this section have been gathered through evaluating our algorithms in Nt = 100 different test points with random positions."}, {"heading": "C.

A suitable metric that includes these features is the empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of errors."}, {"heading": "D. Experimental Results of GS-based Localization Approach", "text": "The localization performance is dependent on the AP selection scheme. Fig. 3 depicts the average localization errors under the two different AP selection methods, namely the strongest AP selection and Fisher criterion when the area has been divided into K = 15 groups. The horizontal axis shows the number of APs used for localization. The AP selection based on Fisher criterion has definitely better performance. For the rest of results, the Fisher criterion has been chosen as the AP selection mechanism.\nFig. 4 shows the MAE of CS-based and GS-based localization for an increasing number of APs. In implementing the CS-based localization, the whole radio map has been used\nwithout utilizing any coarse localization. The localization error for the CS approach is large if the number of APs is small. The intuition behind this performance is that a large number of APs (S > logN) is required to render unique recovery of the position vector [43], [44]. For a better performance with a low number of APs, the CS-based localization needs to resort to coarse localization to decrease the number of RPs, N . However, the performance of GS-based localization remains quite constant regardless of the number of utilized APs and is slightly enhanced when more APs are engaged in localization. The least localization error is achieved when 12 APs are used.\nThe cumulative distribution of errors of the proposed approach is compared against that of the CS-based localization and depicted in Fig. 7. We observe large errors in CSbased localization which indicates that the solution is misled. The proposed GS-based localization shows very desired CDF characteristics as most of the errors are concentrated below 10 ft with the maximum at 22ft.\nThe localization error statistics of the GS-based approach is\nalso compared against those of some of the recent approaches in Table I. The Centaur is an interesting combination of WiFi and acoustic ranging (AR) localization [62]. The table shows the the GS has smaller errors than Centaur.\nThe statistics of the localization error at the AET and BSE environment is illustrated in Table II for L = 4 and L = 10 APs. The error statistics are comparable which shows the consistency of the method over different environments.\nTABLE II POSITION ERROR STATISTICS COMPARISON FOR AET AND BSE ENVIRONMENTS\nPercentages AETL=4, K=15 AET L=10, K=15 BSE L=4, K=25 BSE\nL=10, K=25 25% (ft) 1.49 1.51 0 1.2 50% (ft) 3.17 3.28 3 3 75%(ft) 7.41 7.1 7.5 6.29 100% (ft) 29.26 17.2 39.3 33 Avg (ft) 5.6 5.74 7.69 4.97\nError (ft) 0 50 100 150 200 250\nC D\nF\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nGS-based localization CS-based localization\nFig. 7.

Normally, in a well-functioning system, the percentage of the APs that experience outliers is low. However, the MGS-based localization shows a small increase in localization error when less than 9 APs are malfunctioning, indicating its robustness to outliers. The MGS-based approach is suitable when unprecedented events, like fire, flooding, and earthquake, occur and a large portion of the infrastructure is damaged and emergency localization becomes crucial.\nIn order to evaluate how the errors are spread when APs contain outliers, the cumulative distribution function of errors for the MGS-based and CS-based localization approaches are shown in Fig. 9 when 40 % of the APs in the system do not function properly due to outliers.

However, it is observed that the MGS-based localization has a maximum error of 67 ft."}, {"heading": "F. Tuning Parameters", "text": "There are different ways to tune the parameters \u03bb1, \u03bb2 for the GS-based and \u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3 for MGS-based localization schemes. One approach is the well-known Cross Validation (CV) [64]. The CV finds the Mean Square Error (MSE) of the residuals for a range of \u03bbi, i = 1, 2, 3, and chooses the one with the least MSE. Another approach is to use training data\nand find the best values that minimize the localization error. The latter method, which has been used in this paper, is an easy and effective way for selecting these parameters. Only 10 training samples have been used for tuning. Fig. 10 shows the localization error for an increasing \u03bb1/\u03bb2 when 12 APs have been used. The best parameter values must be calibrated for each building (e.g., at the fingerprinting stage). In the above results, we chose \u03bb1/\u03bb2 = 0.5 for GS-based localization and \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = 0.1, \u03bb3 = 0.01 for the MGS-based localization approach.\nSince the GS-based localization needs to divide the area into groups and assign a weight to each, the number of groups also plays an important role in localization accuracy. To this end, an experiment is conducted to evaluate the localization error for different number of groups and the results are shown in Fig. 11 for AET and BSE building environments when 4 and 10 APs are used for localization. The results illustrate that 15 groups are optimal to achieve the highest localization accuracy compared to 25 groups for BSE environment. The\nBSE environment is structurally more complex than the AET environment and hence, it introduces a diverse set of RPs. However, it is clear that small localization errors for both environments are achieved which indicates the consistency of the method in different environments."}, {"heading": "G. Experimental Results of LASSO-based Interpolation Scheme", "text": "Furthermore, the LASSO-based approach of Section VII, is utilized in the offline phase to reduce the number of fingerprints. For radio map interpolation, we chose 96, 64, 48, and 38 randomly selected RPs which lead to 12 , 1 3 , 1 4 , and 1 5 of the total 192 RPs, respectively.

(24) The radio map reconstruction error for various ratios of selected RPs are shown in Table III. The reconstruction error when 1/2 of RPs is used for localization is 1.02 dB that is comparable to the error reported in [22].\nFig. 12 represents the results for the CDF of the localization error with the reconstructed radio map when 5 and 19 APs are selected. The proposed scheme is able to achieve a localization error of less than 10 ft for 88 % of the time, when half of the\nfingerprints are interpolated from the actual RPs fingerprints and 19 APs are used. This only reduces to error of less than 10 ft for 80 % . The results show that large fingerprinting cost and time savings can be achieved while tolerating a small increase in the localization error.\nIn sum, the previous results show two advantages of our approach. First, our scheme exhibits higher performance than the recent competing alternative. Second, the method can be utilized in emergency applications where the WLAN system is not functioning properly, and it is not clear which APs have problems or are unavailable."}, {"heading": "IX. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed three novel schemes for indoor WLAN fingerprinting localization, outlier detection, and radio map interpolation. The Group-Sparsity localization system does not rely on the typical coarse localization that other schemes require. Instead, the reference points are grouped in clusters, where each cluster participates in localization with its appropriate weight. Thus, the problem of wrong coarse localization has been avoided. The proposed approach uses convex optimization to localize the user. This minimization has three components that include the residuals between the radio map and the online measurements, the `1-norm of the user\u2019s location for sparse recovery, and weighted `2-norm of the groups of RPs to introduce the group sparsity.\nSince the AP online readings are prone to outliers due to unavailability or adversary attacks on APs, an outliers detection scheme also relying on sparse regression was developed. By explicitly modeling the outliers, the outliers are jointly estimated with the user\u2019s location vector.\nTo reduce the time-consuming and labor intensive radio map fingerprinting, a special form of Sparse Group Lasso regression was introduced which enables the fingerprints to be recorded at a coarse grid and radio map can be interpolated at finer grids.\nThe positioning system has been evaluated using real data from a high-commuting building that includes offices, labs, and a library. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme leads to substantial localization accuracy performance over the conventional fingerprinting methods.\nAPPENDIX\nThe selection of RPs for interpolation can also be rendered as sampling from all the available RPs and recording the respective fingerprints. This appendix uses the previous derivation to illustrate that regular sampling of the radio map lead to very inaccurate radio map interpolation, and advocates the use of random sampling.\nIn particular, the regular sampling of RPs can be thought as two consecutive procedures: 1) Compression (down-sampling) of the readings with a rate of s for each single AP, \u03c8i, by s RPs as\n\u03c8idown[n] = \u03c8 i sn, n = 1, . . . ,\nN\ns ,\n\u2200i = 1, . . . , L (25)\nfollowed by an extension (up-sampling) with the rate of s, which inserts s zeros in between each RP of \u03c8idown[n]\n\u03c8idown\u2212up[n] =\n{ \u03c8idown[ n s ] if n = sk k = 1, . . . , N s\n0 otherwise\n=\n{ \u03c8idown[n] if n = sk k = 1, . . . , N s\n0 otherwise (26)\nAccording to the above sampling procedure, each row of the sampling matrix A is a sparse vector that has only one nonzero value whose index shows the RP that we have recorded the fingerprints.\nHowever, our results showed that the structure of periodic RP selection, in which A has periodic sampling structure, does not necessarily lead to a unique solution for \u03c8if in (19) for all s = 1, 2, . . . , N . In particular, it is not hard to check that the Fourier transform of (26) [according to (17)] will satisfy the measurement equation (19) exactly. As such, it is likely that the outcome of the optimization (18) will be (26), which is clearly a very inadequate interpolation of the original radio map.\nTherefore, the RPs whose fingerprints are engaged in interpolation should be selected randomly. In this case, the structure of the rows of A is randomly sparse."}], "references": [{"title": "Data fusion of power and time measurements for mobile terminal location", "author": ["M. McGuire", "K.

The localization method consists of a novel multicomponent optimization technique that minimizes the squared `2-norm of the residuals between the radio map and the online Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements, the `1-norm of the user\u2019s location vector, and weighted `2-norms of layered groups of Reference Points (RPs). RPs are grouped using a new criterion based on the similarity between the so-called Access Point (AP) coverage vectors. In addition, since AP readings are prone to containing inordinate readings, called outliers, an augmented optimization problem is proposed to detect the outliers and localize the user with cleaned online measurements. Moreover, a novel scheme to record fingerprints from a smaller number of RPs and estimate the radio map at RPs without recorded fingerprints is developed using sparse recovery techniques. All localization schemes are tested on RSS fingerprints collected from a real environment. The overall scheme has comparable complexity with competing approaches, while it performs with high accuracy under a small number of APs and finer granularity of RPs.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
