Just to mention some of the most recent ones, interval-valued fuzzy sets have been used in decision making (see, e.g., the works by Khalil and Hassan [36] and Cheng et al. [20]), image processing (see, e.g., the works by Barrenechea et al. [2], Pagola et al. [45] and Melin et al. [39]) or classification (see, e.g., the works by Sanz et al. [52, 53]). They have also been the origin of rich theoretical studies, as, for instance, the works by Bedregal et al. [3, 7], Dimuro et al. [28], Reiser et al. [48] and the recent works by Zywica et al. [64] and Taka\u0301c [55].\nFrom the point of view of applications, interval-valued fuzzy sets are a suitable tool to represent uncertain or incomplete information. In particular, the length of the intervalvalued membership degree of a given element can be understood as a measure of the lack of certainty of the expert for providing an exact membership value to that element [44]. Interval degrees are also be used to summarize the opinions of several experts. In this case, the left and right interval endpoints can be, for instance, the least and the greatest membership degrees provided by a group of experts. This makes interval-valued fuzzy sets very useful for multiexpert decision making problems, when the experts are asked to express numerically their preferences on several alternatives, as discussed by Bustince et al. [17] (see also the discussions about that in [3, 9, 15, 16]).\nBesides, another relevant tool for many different application is that of OWA operators, introduced by Yager [59] and largely used in the literature (see, e.g.: [34, 35, 41]). Its usefulness has led to the consideration of different possible extensions for Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy sets ([37, 42, 58, 61]) and for interval-valued fuzzy sets ([17, 21, 57, 63]).\nIn the latter case, however, one of the key problems is how to build and normalize intervalvalued weights. In the literature, interval-valued weights are used in several contexts, in order to face the problem of real-world applications in which there are a lot of uncertainty involved and lack of consensus among the modeling experts. Pavlacka [47] presented a review of the existing methods for normalization of interval weights. For example, in the context of multicriterion decision making, Wang and Li [56] used a hierarchical structure to aggregate local interval weights into global interval weights, by means of a pair of linear programming models to maximize the lower and upper bounds of the aggregated interval value.\nHowever, in the definitions of interval-valued OWA operators found in the literature, the weighted vector is composed, in general, by real numbers. Due to this limitation of the actual models of interval-valued OWA operators, in this paper, we propose the use of interval weights. In order to define these weights we propose the extension of the so-called overlap functions [8, 11, 14, 25, 27] to the interval-valued setting. In this way, the normalization method proposed here makes use of the properties of aggregation functions, and, thus, it is defined in flexible terms.\nThen, the objectives of this paper are:\n\u2022 To introduce the concept of interval-valued overlap functions, and to analyze some of its most relevant properties, such as migrativity and homogeneity;\n\u2022 To define the normalization of an interval-valued weighted vector by means of a general aggregation function, and to determine which conditions normalized weighted vectors should fulfill;\n\u2022 To develop a construction method of interval-valued OWA operators based on intervalvalued overlap functions, considering interval-valued weights;\n\u2022 To study the properties of such OWA operators, specially considering the migrativity and homogeneity of interval-valued overlap functions.\nThis work is organized as follows. In Section 2, we recall some basic concepts that we are going to use along the paper. Next, we define the basic order relations between intervals and, in Section 4, we define the concept of interval-valued overlap function and we study some of its most important properties. In Section 5 we present the concept of normalized weighted vector, and we analyze the definition of interval-valued OWA operators with interval weights. We also study the conditions that the functions used for the definition must fulfill to recover idempotency and other properties. We finish with conclusions and references."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminary Concepts", "text": "We start, in this section, recalling some well-known concepts which will be ncessary for our subsequent developments.\nConsider a function f : [0, 1]n \u2192 [0, 1].

In particular, in this work we are interested in the following two ones.\n(M3) If M(x1, . . . , xn) = 0 then there is i = 1, . . . , n such that xi = 0;\n(M4) If M(x1, . . . , xn) = 1 then there is i = 1, . . . , n such that xi = 1.\nAmong the class of aggregation functions, the so-called OWA operators are a very relevant case. These operators were defined by Yager in [59, 60] in the following way:\nDefinition 2 Let w = (w1, . . . , wn) \u2208 [0, 1]n be a weighted vector (i.e., wi \u2208 [0, 1] and n\u2211 i=1 wi = 1). An OWA operator of dimension n associated to the weighted vector w is a function OWA : [0, 1]n \u2192 [0, 1] defined by\nOWA(x1, . . . , xn) =\nn\u2211\ni=1\nwix(i)\nwhere (.) denotes a permutation of {1, . . . , n} such that x(1) \u2265 x(2) \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 x(n).\nAnother relevant example of aggregation functions is provided by overlap functions [11].\nDefinition 3 A function GO : [0, 1] 2 \u2192 [0, 1] is an overlap function if it satisfies the following conditions: (GO1) GO is commutative; (GO2) GO(x, y) = 0 if and only if xy = 0; (GO3) GO(x, y) = 1 if and only if xy = 1; (GO4) GO is non-decreasing; (GO5) GO is continuous.\nSeveral well-known functions fall into the scope of overlap functions, as, for instance, continuous t-norm without zero divisors, see [8, 25, 27, 26].\nIt is worth to mention that if an overlap function has a neutral element, then by (GO3) it is necessarily 1. Moreover, associative overlaps always have 1 as neutral element and so they are continuous t-norms without zero divisors [11].\nExample 1 Nevertheless, there are overlaps having 1 as neutral element such that they are not associative. For example,\nGO(x, y) = min(x, y)max(x 2, y2)\nor, more generally, GO(x, y) = min(x, y)max(x p, yp)\nfor every p > 0.\nWe denote as O the set of all overlap functions. It follows that \u3008O,\u2264O\u3009, where \u2264O is defined for GO1 , GO2 \u2208 O by\nGO1 \u2264O GO2 if and only if GO1(x, y) \u2264 GO2(x, y)\nfor all x, y \u2208 [0, 1], is a lattice [11, Theorem 3]. In particular, the supremum and infimum of two arbitrary overlap functions GO1 and GO2 are again overlap functions\nGO1 \u2228GO2(x, y) = max(GO1(x, y), GO2(x, y)) and GO1 \u2227GO2(x, y) = min(GO1(x, y), GO2(x, y))\n(1)\nThe class of overlap functions is also convex, as was proved in [11]. That is, if we take two overlap functions GO1 and GO2 . then for each w1, w2 \u2208 [0, 1] such that w1 + w2 = 1 we have that their convex sum\nGO(x, y) = w1GO1(x, y) + w2GO2(x, y) (2)\nis also an overlap [11, Corollary 1]."}, {"heading": "2.2 Interval-valued fuzzy sets", "text": "We denote by L([0, 1]) = {[a, b] \u2208 [0, 1]2 : a \u2264 b} be the set of all closed subintervals of the unit interval [0, 1]. In order to simplify the notation, we use the projections of an interval [a, b] \u2208 L([0, 1]), given by:\n[a, b] = a and [a, b] = b. (3)\nThose intervals X such that X = X are called degenerate intervals or diagonals elements of L([0, 1]). We denote by D the set of all degenerate intervals.\nRecall that an interval-valued fuzzy set (IVFS) A on a universe U is defined by means of an interval membership function \u00b5A : U \u2192 L([0, 1]).\nLet\u2019s consider now the problem of ordering in L([0, 1]). First of all, we have the following partial orders:\nProduct order: X \u2264Pr Y iff X \u2264 Y and X \u2264 Y ; and\nInclusion order: X \u2286 Y iff Y \u2264 X \u2264 X \u2264 Y\n(L([0, 1]),\u2264Pr) is a continuous lattice and so it is a bounded lattice ([32, 54]). In fact the bottom of this lattice is [0, 0], its top is [1, 1], the supremum and infimum of two arbitrary intervals X,Y \u2208 L([0, 1]) are the following intervals:\nX \u2228 Y = [max(X,Y ),max(X,Y )], and X \u2227 Y = [min(X,Y ),min(X,Y )].\nNotice that, in general, it is possible to define a linear order in L([0, 1]) as follows:\nDefinition 4 [12, 17] A binary relation on L([0, 1]) is an admissible order if it is a linear order on L([0, 1]) refining \u2264Pr.\nAdmissible orders generated by aggregation functions extend the usual product order on the set of intervals. A deep analysis of this kind of orders can be found in [12].\nSome operations on L([0, 1]) that are used in this paper are defined, for allX,Y \u2208 L([0, 1]), as:\nProduct: XY = [XY ,XY ];\nExponentiation 1: X [k1,k2] = [Xk2 ,X k1 ] for 0 < k1 \u2264 k2;\nExponentiation 2: X\u2212[k1,k2] = [X \u2212k1 ,X\u2212k2 ] for any X \u2208 L([0, 1]) and 0 < k1 \u2264 k2;\nComplement: Xc = [1\u2212X, 1\u2212X]; and\nArctan: Arctan(X) = [arctan(X), arctan(X)].\nWhen k1 = k2 usually we will write X k1 instead of X [k1,k2]. We discuss now the relation between interval-valued and real-valued functions. A function F : L([0, 1])n \u2192 L([0, 1]) is an interval representation of a function f : [0, 1]n \u2192 [0, 1] ([5, 28, 51]), if for any X1, . . . ,Xn \u2208 L([0, 1]), f(x1, . . . , xn) \u2208 F (X1, . . . ,Xn) when xi \u2208 Xi for i = 1, . . . , n.\nNotice that the interval representation of a given function f is not unique, in general. In fact, the function F : L([0, 1])n \u2192 L([0, 1]) defined as F (X1, . . . ,Xn) = [0, 1], for every X1, . . . ,Xn \u2208 L([0, 1]), is an interval representation of any function f : [0, 1]n \u2192 [0, 1].\nIf F is an interval representation of some real function then it is inclusion monotonic, that is, F (X1, . . . ,Xn) \u2286 F (Y1, . . . , Y2) whenever Xi \u2286 Yi, for each i = 1, . . . , n.\nThe extension of the notion of an aggregation function to the interval-valued setting can be done in the following way.\nDefinition 5 Let \u2264 be an order that extends \u2264Pr.1 An interval-valued aggregation function with respect to \u2264 is a function M : L([0, 1])n \u2192 L([0, 1]) such that\n1. M is increasing in each argument with respect to \u2264: for every i = 1, . . . , n, if Xi \u2264 Yi then M(X1, . . . ,Xn) \u2264 M(Y1, . . . , Yn);\n2. M([0, 0], . . . , [0, 0]) = [0, 0] and M([1, 1], . . . , [1, 1]) = [1, 1].\nWe finish recalling two notions which are of interest when dealing with overlap functions: migrativity and homogeneity.\nThe concept of \u03b1-migrativity was introduced by Durante et al. in [29], see also [40, Problem 1.8(b)] and [30]. Santana et al. [50] extended, in a natural way, the notion of migrativity to the interval-valued setting.\nAn interval-valued function F : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]) is migrative if for any \u03b1,X, Y \u2208 L([0, 1]), we have that F (\u03b1X, Y ) = F (X,\u03b1Y ).\nThe following results are analogous to those discussed in [13], so we do not include a proof.\nLemma 6 A function F : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]) is migrative if and only if F (X,Y ) = F ([1, 1],XY ).\nProposition 7 [50, Theorem 1.1] A function F : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]) is migrative if and only if the interval function gF : L([0, 1]) \u2192 L([0, 1]), defined, for all X \u2208 L([0, 1]), by\ngF (X) = F ([1, 1],X) (4)\nis such that F (X,Y ) = gF (XY ), for each X,Y \u2208 L([0, 1]).\nCorollary 8 If F : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]) is migrative, then, for any X \u2208 L([0, 1]), it holds that F ([1, 1],X) = F ( \u221a X, \u221a X).\nWith respect to homogeneity, it can also be extended to the interval-valued setting in the following way. An interval function F : L([0, 1])n \u2192 L([0, 1]) is homogeneous of order K = [k1, k2], with 0 < k1 \u2264 k2, if, for any \u03b1,Xi \u2208 L([0, 1]) with i = 1, . . . , n, the identity\nF (\u03b1X1, . . . , \u03b1Xn) = \u03b1 KF (X1, . . . ,Xn)\nholds. 1Observe that \u2264 does need to be a linear order."}, {"heading": "3 Interval-Valued Overlaps", "text": "In this section, we introduce the concept of interval-valued overlap functions, which is the key concept of this work.\nDefinition 9 A function O : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]) is an interval-valued overlap function if it satisfies the following conditions:\n(O1).- O is commutative;\n(O2).- O(X,Y ) = [0, 0] if and only if XY = [0, 0];\n(O3).- O(X,Y ) = [1, 1] if and only if XY = [1, 1];\n(O4).- O is monotonic in the second component, i.e. O(X,Y ) \u2264Pr O(X,Z) when Y \u2264Pr Z.\n(O5).- O is Moore continuous [1, 43, 51].\nNote that, by (O1) and (O4), interval-valued overlaps also are monotonic in the first component. Observe also that the first four points in our definition are analogous to the first four points in Definition 3. In the last point, however, and in order to have a notion of continuity, we take Moore continuity.\nLet O be the set of all interval-valued overlap functions. We may define on O the binary relation:\nO1 \u2264O O2 iff O1(X,Y ) \u2264Pr O2(X,Y ), for all X,Y \u2208L([0, 1]) Clearly, \u2264O is a partial order on O. Furthermore, and analogously to the case of real-valued overlap functions, we have the following result.\nProposition 10 (O,\u2264O) is an unbounded lattice.\nProof: Let O1 and O2 be interval-valued overlap functions. Then the functions O1 \u2228O O2, O1 \u2227O O2 : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]) defined by\nO1 \u2228O O2(X,Y ) = O1(X,Y ) \u2228O2(X,Y )\nand O1 \u2227O O2(X,Y ) = O1(X,Y ) \u2227O2(X,Y )\nare clearly the supremum and infimum of O1 and O2. It is not hard to prove that both are also interval-valued overlap functions.\nOn the other hand, in order to prove that (O,\u2264O) is unbounded it is enough to note that for any interval-valued overlap function O and natural number n \u2265 2, the functions O n \u221a , On : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]), defined by\nO n \u221a (X,Y ) = O( n \u221a X, n \u221a Y )\nand On(X,Y ) = O(Xn, Y n), respectively, also are interval-valued overlap functions and On <O O <O O n \u221a\n. Therefore, there is neither a least nor a great interval-valued overlap function.\nIn fact, in the above proposition, if we denote by O \u221e \u221a\n= lim n\u2192\u221e\nO n \u221a\nand O\u221e = lim n\u2192\u221e On,\nthen it holds that that\nO \u221e \u221a (X,Y ) = { [0, 0] if X \u2228 Y = [0, 0] [1, 1] otherwise\nand\nO\u221e(X,Y ) = { [1, 1] if X \u2227 Y = [1, 1] [0, 0] otherwise.\nObserve that these functions are not interval-valued overlap functions, since they do not fulfill the Properties (O2) and (O3), respectively.\nThe relation between overlap functions and t-norms in the real case is preserved in the interval-valued framework.\nProposition 11 Let O be an interval-valued overlap function. If O is associative then O is a continuous and positive interval-valued t-norm.\nProof: Let gO : L([0, 1]) \u2192 L([0, 1]) be the function gO(X) = O(X, [1, 1]). By continuity of O, gO is also continuous. Since, gO([0, 0]) = [0, 0] and gO([1, 1]) = [1, 1] then, for any X \u2208 L([0, 1]), there exists Y \u2208 L([0, 1]) such that gO(Y ) = X. Therefore, by the associativity property and (O3), we have that\nX = O(Y, [1, 1]) = O(Y,O([1, 1], [1, 1])) = O(O(Y, [1, 1]), [1, 1]) = O(X, [1, 1]).\nSo, O has [1, 1] as neutral element. Therefore, since, by hypotheses, O is associative, and by definition of interval-valued overlaps it continuous and positive, then O is a continuous and positive interval-valued t-norm.\nObserve that any interval-valued overlap function that is also an interval-valued t-norm satisfies the condition O([1, 1],X) = X. But there are interval-valued overlap functions, which are not associative (and which are not hence a t-norm), that satisfy this property. For instance, take:\nO(X,Y ) = (Y \u221a X) \u2227 (X \u221a Y )\nor O(X,Y ) = (X \u2227 Y )(X2 \u2228 Y 2)."}, {"heading": "3.1 Representable interval-valued overlap functions", "text": "In this section, we study the representation of interval-valued overlap functions.\nTheorem 12 Let GO1 and GO2 be overlap functions such that GO1 \u2264O GO2 .

GO1 and GO2 are called representatives of O. Observe, however, that not every interval-valued overlap function is o-representable, for example O(X,Y ) = [XXY Y ,X Y ]\nis clearly not o-representable. Now we intend to characteriza those interval-valued overlap functions which are o-representable. We start with the next definition.\nDefinition 13 Let F : L([0, 1])n \u2192 L([0, 1]) be a monotonic function. The left and right projections of F are the functions F,F : [0, 1]n \u2192 [0, 1] defined by\nF (x1, . . . , xn)=F ([x1, x1], . . . , [xn, xn]) F (x1, . . . , xn)=F ([x1, x1], . . . , [xn, xn]), (6)\nrespectively.\nProposition 14 Let O : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]) be an interval-valued overlap function. If O is strongly positive (SP), that is, it holds that either X = 0 or Y = 0 whereas O(X,Y ) = [0, z], for some z \u2208 (0, 1], then O as well as O are overlap functions.\nProof: For i = 1, 3, 4, since O satisfies the Property (Oi), then, from Equation (6), O clearly satisfies the Property (Oi). Note that O is continuous, since it is a composition of two continuous functions \u2013 the interval-valued overlap O and the left projection. So, O, and analogously O), are overlap functions. It remains to prove that O satisfies (GO2). In fact, if O(x, y) = 0 then one has that O([x, x], [y, y]) = [0, z], for some z \u2208 [0, 1]. If z = 0 then, by (O2), it holds that either [x, x] = [0, 0] or [y, y] = [0, 0], which implies either x = 0 or y = 0. If z > 0, by (SP), we have that x = 0 or y = 0. On the other hand, if x > 0 and y > 0 then it holds that O([x, x], [y, y]) > [0, 0], which implies O(x, y) \u2265 0. But, when O(x, y) = 0, considering what it was proved above, we have that either x = 0 or y = 0, which is a contradiction, since x > 0 and y > 0. Therefore, O(x, y) > 0 and hence it satisfies (GO2).\nRemark 1 It is important to point out that there exist some interval overlap functions O such that O is not an overlap function. For instance, if TL is the Lukasiewicz\u2019s t-norm then O([a, b], [c, d]) = [TL(a, c),min(b, d)] is an interval overlap function and, then, one has that O = TL, which is not an overlap function, since it is not positive. This fact shows that the Property (SP) is a necessary condition for the Proposition 14.\nNow we can characterize o-representable interval-valued overlap functions.\nTheorem 15 An interval-valued overlap function O is o-representable if and only if O =\nO\u0303O.\nProof: (\u21d2) If O is o-representable then, by Theorem 12, it holds that\nO = G\u0303O1GO2 , (7)\nfor some overlaps GO1 and GO2 such that GO1 \u2264O GO2 . Thus,\nGO1(x, y) = [GO1(x, y), GO2(x, y)] by Eq. (3)\n= G\u0303O1GO2([x, x], [y, y]) by Eq. (5) = O([x, x], [y, y]) by Eq. (7)\n= O(x, y) by Eq. (6)\nAnalogously, one shows that GO2 = O. So, by Eq. (7), it holds that O = O\u0303,O. (\u21d0) It is straightforward, following from Proposition 14. In fact, we can go one step further, thanks to the following Lemma.\nLemma 16 Let F : L([0, 1])n \u2192 L([0, 1]) be a monotonic function. Then, for any Xi \u2208 L([0, 1]), with i = 1, . . . , n, it holds that\nF (X1, . . . ,Xn) = [F (X1, . . . ,Xn), F (X1, . . . ,Xn)]\nif and only if F is inclusion monotonic.\nProof: It is an easy and trivial extension for n-ary interval-valued functions of in [28, Theorem 8].\nTheorem 17 An interval-valued overlap function O is o-representable if and only if is inclusion monotonic.\nProof: It is straightforward, following from Lemma 16, Proposition 14, and theorems 12 and 15.\nIn [23], the notion of t-representability was introduced and led to the concepts of pseudo trepresentability (denoted by TT ), generalized pseudo t-representability (denoted by TT,t) and a third type without a particular name, which is denoted by T \u2032T . It is clear that whenever we substitute the t-norm T by an overlap O, then TO are o-representable interval-valued overlap functions, whereas TO,t and T \u2032O are not. However, in the present paper, we provide a more generic class of \u201crepresentable\u201d interval-valued overlap functions, which properly contains those three classes.\nDefinition 18 An interval-valued overlap O is semi o-representable if there exist overlap functions GOi : [0, 1]\n2 \u2192 [0, 1], with i = 1, . . . , 8, and functions M1,M2 : [0, 1]4 \u2192 [0, 1], such that for each X,Y \u2208 L([0, 1]), it holds that:\nO(X, Y )= [M1(GO1(X,Y ), GO2(X,Y ), GO3(X, Y ), GO4(X,Y )),\nM2(GO5(X, Y ), GO6(X,Y ), GO7(X,Y ), GO8(X,Y ))] (8)\nTheorem 19 Let GOi, with i = 1, . . . , 8, be overlap functions and M1,M2 : [0, 1] 4 \u2192 [0, 1] be aggregation functions such that GOi \u2264O GOi+4 , for i = 1, . . . , 4, it holds that M1 \u2264 M2. Then, for the interval-valued overlap function O : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]), defined as in Equation (8), it holds that:\n1. If GO1 = GO2, GO5 = GO6 and M1 and M2 are commutative in the two first components then O satisfies (O1);\n2. If either M1 or M2 satisfies the property (M3) with respect to the fourth component, i.e., M1(x1, x2, x3, x4) = 0 then x4 = 0, and the same for M2. Then O satisfies (O2);\n3. If either M1 or M2 satisfies the property (M4) with respect to the third component, then O satisfies (O3);\n4. If GOi \u2264O GOi+4, for i = 1, . . . , 4, then O satisfies (O4);\n5. O satisfies (O5) if and only if M1 and M2 are continuous.\nProof:\n1. We start proving that (O1) holds. Take X,Y \u2208 L([0, 1]). Then:\nO(X,Y )\n= [M1(GO1(X,Y ), GO1(X,Y ), GO3(X,Y ), GO4(X,Y )),\nM2(GO5(X,Y ), GO5(X,Y ), GO7(X,Y ), GO8(X,Y ))]\n= [M1(GO1(Y ,X), GO1(Y ,X), GO3(Y ,X), GO4(Y ,X)),\nM2(GO5(Y ,X), GO5(Y ,X), GO7(Y ,X), GO8(Y ,X))]\n= [M1(GO1(Y ,X), GO1(Y ,X), GO3(Y ,X), GO4(Y ,X)),\nM2(GO5(GO5(Y ,X), Y ,X), GO7(Y ,X), GO8(Y ,X))]\n= O(Y,X).\n2. Assume thatM1 or M2 satisfy the property (M3) with respect to the fourth component. If O(X,Y ) = [0, 0] then one has that:\nM1(GO1(X,Y ), GO2(X,Y ), GO3(X,Y ), GO4(X,Y )) = 0\nand M2(GO5(X,Y ), GO6(X,Y ), GO7(X,Y ), GO8(X,Y )) = 0\nSince, as M1 or M2 satisfies (M3) with respect to the fourth component, then it follows that either GO4(X,Y ) = 0 or GO8(X,Y ) = 0. In both cases, by (O2), one has that either X = 0 or Y = 0, and, therefore, either X = [0, 0] or Y = [0, 0]. On the other hand, if XY = [0, 0], then one has that X = [0, 0] or Y = [0, 0]. Assume that X = [0, 0]. It follows that:\nO([0, 0], Y )\n= [M1(GO1(0, Y ), GO2(0, Y ), GO3(0, Y ), GO4(0, Y )),\nM2(GO5(0, Y ), GO6(0, Y ), GO7(0, Y ), GO8(0, Y ))] by Eq. (8)\n= [M1(0, 0, 0, 0),M2(0, 0, 0, 0)] by (O2)\n= [0, 0] by (A2)\nIf Y = [0, 0] we can make an analogous calculation. Therefore, if XY = [0, 0] then it holds that O(X,Y ) = [0, 0]. Therefore, the Property (O2) holds.\n3. It can be done analogously to item 2;\nThe items 4. and 5. hold straightforwardly, since the composition of monotonic and continuous functions is monotonic and continuous.\nExample 2 A trivial example of aggregation functions M1 and M2, and overlap functions GOi , with i = 1, . . . , 8, satisfying the conditions of the Theorem 19 can be obtained taking GOi such that GOi = GOj , for each i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , 8}, and considering the aggregation functions M1(x1, . . . , x4) = x4 and M2(x1, . . . , x4) = x3.\nCorollary 20 If there exist functions M1, M2 and GOi, with i = 1, . . . , 8, satisfying the condition of Theorem 19, then the interval-valued overlap function O defined as in Equation (8) is semi o-representable.\nSemi o-representability and representability are related, as we discuss next.\nProposition 21 Let O be an interval-valued overlap. If O is o-representable or there exists a t-norm T such that either O = TT or O = TT,t, for some t \u2208 [0, 1], or O = T \u2032T , then O is semi o-representable.\nProof: For the first case, that is, if O = G\u0303\u2032OGO, for some overlaps functions G \u2032 O and GO, then it is sufficient to consider GO3 = G \u2032 O, GO8 = GO, M1(x1, . . . , x4) = x3 and M2(x1, . . . , x4) = x4. For the second case, that is, if O = TT , then it is sufficient to consider Oi = T , for i = 3, 5, 6, M1(x1, . . . , x4) = x3 and M2(x1, . . . , x4) = max(x1, x2). For the third case, that is, if O = TT,t, then it is sufficient consider GOi = T , for i = 3, 5, 6, 8, M1(x1, . . . , x4) = x3 and M2(x1, . . . , x4) = max(x1, x2, T (t, x4)). For the fourth case, that is, O = T \u2032T , then it is sufficient to consider GOi = T , for i = 1, 2, 8, M1(x1, . . . , x4) = min(x1, x2) and M2(x1, . . . , x4) = x4.\nLet F : L([0, 1]) \u2192 L([0, 1]) be defined by F (X) = m(X) + 12(X \u2212m(X)), where m(X) is the middle point of X, that is m(X) = X+X2 . [43] An alternative definition of F is the following:\nF (X) =\n[ X +m(X)\n2 , X +m(X) 2\n] .\nThe function O : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]) defined by\nO(X,Y ) = F (X) \u2227 F (Y )\nis an interval-valued overlap (observe that O is Moore continuous because F and the infimum are Moore continuous [1, 51]). Notice that F is not inclusion monotone [1, 43] and, therefore, by Theorem 17, O is not o-representable. Moreover, by a simple calculation, one may show that\nO(X,Y ) = [min(aX + bX, aY + bY ),min(bX + aX, bY + aY )] (9)\nwhere a = 34 and b = 1 4 . Thus, if there exists M1 : [0, 1] 4 \u2192 [0, 1] and overlap functions GOi , with i = 1, . . . , 4, such that\nM1(GO1(X,Y ), GO2(X,Y ), GO3(X,Y ), GO4(X,Y )) = min(aX + bX, aY + bY ) (10)\nthen, without loss of generality, we can think that GOi(x, y) = x in some condition and GOi(x, y) = y in the other cases, in such a way that, for each X and Y , it holds that {GO1(X,Y ), GO2(X,Y ), GO3(X,Y ), GO4(X,Y )} = {X,X, Y , Y }. So, by (O1), one has that GO1(x, y) = x if and only if GO2(x, y) = y. Thus, for the particular case where X = [0, 0], then it holds that GO1(0, 0.5) = 0 if and only if GO2(0, 0.5) = 0.5, which is in contradiction with the condition (O2). Therefore, O(X,Y ) for O defined as in Eq. (9) can not be obtained as in Eq. (10)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Migrative and Homogeneous Interval-valued Overlap Functions", "text": "In this subsection we make a study analogous to [11, Proposition 1].2\nProposition 22 For an interval-valued function O : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]), it holds that:\n1. If F satisfies the Property (O2) then O does not satisfy the self-duality property (SDP), that is, the equation\nF (X,Y ) = F (Xc, Y c)c (11)\nfails, for some X,Y \u2208 L([0, 1]);\n2. If F is migrative then F satisfies the Property (O1);\n3. If F is homogeneous of order K then F ([0, 0], [0, 0]) = [0, 0];\n4. If F is homogeneous of order [1, 1] and F ([1, 1], [1, 1]) = [1, 1] then F is idempotent;\n5. If F is migrative and idempotent then F is also homogeneous of order [1, 1];\n6. If F is migrative and has [1, 1] as neutral element then F is homogeneous of order [2, 2].\nProof:\n2Notice that the item (iii) of Proposition 1 in [11] is wrong. To see that, just consider the constant function GO(x, y) = 0.\n1. By the Property (O2), we have that F ([0, 0], [1, 1]) = [0, 0]. On the other hand, by the definition of complement and the Property (O2), we have that F ([0, 0]c, [1, 1]c)c = F ([1, 1], [0, 0])c = [0, 0]c = [1, 1]. Therefore, the Equation (11) fails.\n2. If F is migrative then F (X,Y ) = F ([1, 1]X,Y ) = F ([1, 1],XY ) = F ([1, 1], Y X) = F (Y,X).\n3. It follows that F ([0, 0], [0, 0]) = [0, 0]KF (X,Y ) = [0, 0].\n4. It holds that F (X,X) = X [1,1]F ([1, 1], [1, 1]) = X[1, 1] = X\n5. By Proposition 7, one has that F (X,Y ) = gF (XY ). Since F is idempotent, then gF (X) = gF ( \u221a X \u221a X) = F ( \u221a X, \u221a X) = \u221a X. Therefore, it holds that\nF (\u03b1X,\u03b1Y ) = gF (\u03b1 2XY ) = \u03b1 \u221a XY = \u03b1gF (XY ) = \u03b1F (X,Y ).\n6. By Lemma 6 and because [1, 1] is neutral element, one has that F (X,Y ) = F ([1, 1],XY ) = XY . So, it follows that F (\u03b1X,\u03b1Y ) = \u03b12XY = \u03b12F (X,Y ).\nCorollary 23 Let F : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]) be an interval-valued migrative function. F is homogeneous of order [1, 1] if and only if F is idempotent.\nProof: It is straightforward, following from items 4 and 5 of Proposition 22.\nTheorem 24 O : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]) is an interval-valued migrative overlap function if and only if there exists a monotonic and Moore continuous interval function gO : L([0, 1]) \u2192 L([0, 1]) such that, for any X,Y \u2208 L([0, 1]), it holds that O(X,Y ) = gO(XY ), gO([0, 0]) = [0, 0], gO([1, 1]) = [1, 1] and g(X) 6\u2208 {[0, 0], [1, 1]} when X 6\u2208 {[0, 0], [1, 1]}.\nProof: (\u21d2) By Proposition 7, the function gO(X) = O([1, 1],X) is such that O(X,Y ) = gO(XY ), for any X,Y \u2208 L([0, 1]). Since O is monotonic and Moore continuous, then obviously gO also is. On the other hand, by the Property (O2), one has that gO(X) = [0, 0] if and only if O(X, [1, 1]) = [0, 0] if and only if X = [0, 0]. Analogously, it is possible to prove that gO(X) = [1, 1] if and only if X = [1, 1].\n(\u21d0) By Proposition 7, the function O(X,Y ) = gO(XY ) is migrative, and since gO is increasing and Moore continuous, so is O. The symmetry follows from the commutativity of the product. The Properties (O2) and (O3) are straightforward, following from similar properties of gO. So, O is a migrative interval-valued overlap function.\nTheorem 25 Let O : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]) be an interval-valued overlap function. If O is migrative then it is o-representable.\nProof: Let gO be the Moore-continuous function of Theorem 24. Since gO is Moorecontinuous, then there exist two continuous functions g1, g2 : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1] such that gO(X) = [g1(X), g2(X)] (see p.52 of [43]). Since, gO is monotonic then clearly g1 and g2 are increasing and, since it holds that gO([0, 0]) = [0, 0] and gO([1, 1]) = [1, 1], then g1(0) = g2(0) = 0 and g1(1) = g2(1) = 1. Therefore, by [11, Theorem 9], the functions GO1 , GO2 : [0, 1]\n2 \u2192 [0, 1], defined by GO1(x, y) = g1(xy) and GO2(x, y) = g2(xy), respectively, are migrative overlaps functions. We prove that O = G\u0303O1GO2 . It follows that: O(X,Y ) = gO(XY ) = gO([XY ,XY ] = [g1(XY ), g2(XY )]\n= [GO1(X,Y ), GO2(X,Y )] = G\u0303O1GO2(X,Y ) .\nProposition 26 Let O : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]) be an o-representable overlap function. O is homogeneous of order K = [k1, k2], with 0 < k1 \u2264 k2, if and only if their representatives are homogeneous overlaps functions of orders k2 and k1, respectively.\nProof: Since O : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]) is an o-representable interval-valued overlap function then by Theorem 12 and Lemma 16, O = O\u0303,O and, by Proposition 14, O is an overlap function.\n(\u21d2) Consider \u03b1, x, y \u2208 [0, 1]. It follows that:\nO(\u03b1x, \u03b1y) = O([\u03b1x, \u03b1x], [\u03b1y, \u03b1y]) by Eq. (6)\n= O([\u03b1,\u03b1][x, x], [\u03b1,\u03b1][y, y]) = [\u03b1,\u03b1]KO([x, x], [y, y]) by homogeneity = \u03b1k2O([x, x], [y, y]) = \u03b1k2O(x, y)\nTherefore, O is an homogeneous overlap function of order k2. Analogously, O is an homogeneous overlap function of order k1.\n(\u21d0) Consider \u03b1,X, Y \u2208 L([0, 1]). It follows that:\nO\u0303,O(\u03b1X,\u03b1Y ) = [O(\u03b1X,\u03b1Y ), O(\u03b1X,\u03b1Y )] by Eq. (5)\n= [\u03b1k2O(X,Y ), \u03b1k1O(X,Y )] by homogeneity = \u03b1K [O(X,Y ), O(X,Y )]\n= \u03b1KO\u0303O(X,Y ) by Eq. (5)\nAs in the real case, the following result holds.\nTheorem 27 Consider K = [k1, k2], where 0 < k1 \u2264 k2. The unique interval-valued function F : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]) that is migrative, homogeneous of order K and satisfies F ([1, 1], [1, 1]) = [1, 1] is\nF (X,Y ) = (XY ) K [2,2] .\nProof: For any \u03b1,X, Y \u2208 L([0, 1]), by the homegeneity and Theorem 24, one has that F (\u03b1X,\u03b1Y ) = \u03b1KF (X,Y ) = \u03b1KgF (XY ). But, also by Theorem 24, it holds that\nF (\u03b1X,\u03b1Y ) = gF (\u03b1X\u03b1Y ).\nSo, it follows that \u03b1KgF (XY ) = gF (\u03b1 2XY ). Thus, taking X = Y = [1, 1], we have that gF (\u03b1 2) = \u03b1K and, so, gF (\u03b1) = \u03b1 K [2,2] ."}, {"heading": "3.3 Interval-valued overlap functions and t-norms", "text": "There are several non-equivalent but related interval-valued extensions of t-norms, as in [5, 24, 28, 31, 33]. Here we consider the definition provided by [24], which is more general than the notion of [5, 33] and consistent with the notion of lattice-valued t-norms as given, for example, in [4, 19, 23, 46].\nLemma 28 If O : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]) is an associative interval-valued overlap function then gO is idempoten and self-contractive, that is, it holds that gO(gO(X)) = gO(X) and gO(X) \u2286 X, respectively.\nProof: Remember that gO : L([0, 1]) \u2192 L([0, 1]) is defined by gO(X) = O(X, [1, 1]). Thus, for any X \u2208 L([0, 1]), we have that gO(X) = O(X, [1, 1]) = O(X,O([1, 1], [1, 1])) = O(O(X, [1, 1]), [1, 1]) = gO(gO(X)), that is, gO is idempotent. Now, clearly, since O is monotonic, we have that gO also is monotonic and so their projection gO andgO. Analogously, from Moore continuity of O, we have that gO is also Moore continuous and so their projection. Finally, it is immediate that gO(0) = gO(0) = 0 and gO(1) = gO(1) = 1. Then, for any X \u2208 L([0, 1]), there exist x, y \u2208 [0, 1] such that gO(x) = X and gO(y) = X. Since gO \u2264 gO then one has that x \u2264 y. Denote a = gO(x) and b = gO(y). Thus, it holds that gO([x, x]) = [gO(x), gO(x)] = [X, a] and gO([y, y]) = [gO(y), gO(y)] = [b,X ]. Since gO is monotonic, then gO([x, x]) \u2264Pr gO([y, y]), that is, [X, a] \u2264Pr [b,X ]. Thus, one has that a \u2264 X and X \u2264 b. Therefore, it follows that gO([x, x]) \u2264Pr X \u2264Pr gO([y, y]), and, so, by idempotency and isotonicity, it holds that [X, a] \u2264 gO(X) \u2264 [b,X ]. Hence, it follows that X \u2264 gO(X) \u2264 gO(X) \u2264 X, which implies that gO(X) \u2286 X.\nNotice that the self-contractiveness implies in contractiveness in the sense of [6], and so self-contractiveness is stronger than contractiveness.\nTheorem 29 Let O : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]) be an associative interval-valued overlap function such that gO is either surjective or inclusion monotonic. Then O is an interval-valued t-norm.\nProof: We prove that [1, 1] is a neutral element of O. If gO is surjective then there exists Y \u2208 L([0, 1]) such that\ngO(Y ) = X (12)\nand, therefore, gO(gO(Y )) = gO(X). (13)\nThus, by the idempotency of gO (Lemma 28) and by Eq. (13), we have that gO(Y ) = gO(X). Therefore, by Eq. (12), one has that gO(X) = X and, then, O(X, [1, 1]) = gO(X) = X, that is, [1, 1] is a neutral element of O. On the other hand, if gO is inclusion monotonic, then by Lemma 16, one has that\ngO(X) = [gO(X), gO(X)].

(14), one has that O(X, [1, 1]) = gO(X) = X, that is, [1, 1] is a neutral element of O."}, {"heading": "4 Interval-valued OWA operators with interval-valued weighted vectors", "text": "In this section we propose a definition that generalizes OWA operators to the interval-valued setting. In most of the cases, this generalization is carried out by considering interval-valued inputs, with, however, pointwise weights. Our definition handles both interval-valued inputs and weights. We start introducing the notion of weighing vector in our setting.\nDefinition 30 Let M : L([0, 1])n \u2192 L([0, 1]) be an interval-valued aggregation function. An n-tuple (W1, . . . ,Wn) \u2208 L([0, 1])n is said to be an M -weighted vector if and only if\nM(W1, . . . ,Wn) = [1, 1] . (17)\nNote that this definition extends the usual definition of weighted vector in the realvalued case. However, since we consider a general interval-valued aggregation function M for normalizing, we get more flexibility.\nRemark 2 Notice that:\n1. The vector ([1, 1], . . . , [1, 1]) is a weighted vector for every interval-valued aggregation function M .\n2. Consider the function M : L([0, 1])n \u2192 L([0, 1]), given by\nM(X1, . . . ,Xn) = [max(X1, . . . ,Xn),max(X1, . . . ,Xn)]\nThen (W1, . . . ,Wn) \u2208 L([0, 1])n is a M -weighted vector if and only if there exists i0 \u2208 {1, . . . , n} such that Wi0 = [1, 1].\n3. Consider the function M : L([0, 1])n \u2192 L([0, 1]) given by\nM(X1, . . . ,Xn) =\n[ min ( 1, n\u2211\ni=1\nX i)\n) ,min ( 1, n\u2211\ni=1\nXi)\n)]\nThen (W1, . . . ,Wn) \u2208 L([0, 1])n is a M -weighted vector if and only if n\u2211\ni=1 X i \u2265 1.\nOur definition of weighing vector allows us to introduce the concept of interval-valued OWA operator considering interval-valued weights.\nDefinition 31 Let O : L([0, 1])2 \u2192 L([0, 1]) be an interval-valued overlap function such that O([1, 1],X) = X, for every X \u2208 L([0, 1]). Let M : L([0, 1])n \u2192 L([0, 1]) be an interval-valued aggregation function such that for every X1, . . . ,Xn, Y \u2208 L([0, 1]), the identity\nM(O(X1, Y ), . . . , O(Xn, Y )) = O(M(X1, . . . ,Xn), Y ) (18)\nholds. Let W = (W1, . . . ,Wn) \u2208 L([0, 1])n be a M -weighted vector. Then, an interval-valued OWA operator of dimension n is defined as a function\nIV\u2212GOWA : L([0, 1])n \u2192 L([0, 1]),\ngiven by IV\u2212GOWA(X1, . . . ,Xn)=M(O(W1,X(1)), . . . , O(Wn,X(n))),\nwhere (.) denotes a permutation of {1, . . . , n} such that X(n) \u2264 X(n\u22121) \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 X(1) for an admissible order \u2264.\nExample 3 Let be M(X1, . . . ,Xn) = (X1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Xn) 1 n and O(X,Y ) = XY . Then we have that\nM(O(X1, Y ), . . . , O(Xn, Y )) = M(X1Y, . . . ,XnY )\n= (X1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Xn) 1 nY,\nfor every X1, . . . ,Xn, Y \u2208 L([0, 1]). Then, we are in the setting of Definition 31. Note that the only possible weighted vector in this setting is W = ([1, 1], . . . , [1, 1]).\nExample 4 Define\nM(X1, . . . ,Xn) =\n{ [1, 1] if max(X1, . . . ,Xn) = [1, 1]\n[0, 0] otherwise.\nThen, for every interval-valued overlap function O and X1, . . . ,Xn, Y \u2208 L([0, 1]) it holds that:\nM(O(X1, Y ), . . . , O(Xn, Y )) = O(M(X1, . . . ,Xn), Y ).\nNote that, in this case, (W1, . . . ,Wn) is a weighted vector if and only if the identity max(W1, . . . ,Wn) = [1, 1] holds (with respect to the admissible order \u2264).\nThe examples 3 and 4 just present two pairs of interval-valued overlap functions and interval-valued aggregation functions that satisfy the Eq. (18) and, therefore, we can define an interval-valued OWA operator from those pairs. Thus, it would be interesting to have a characterization of such pairs. This fact motivate the following question: \u201cHow can we characterize the interval-valued overlap functions that satisfy the Equation (18), for some interval-valued aggregation function?\u201d We answer this question in the following proposition.\nProposition 32 Consider O(X,Y ) = XY and let M : L([0, 1])n \u2192 L([0, 1]) be an intervalvalued aggregation function. Then the Identity (18) holds if and only if M is an interval-valued homogeneous function of order [1, 1].3\nProof: Firstly, suppose that M is (interval-valued) homogeneous of order [1, 1]. Since O(X,Y ) = XY , then\nM(O(X1, Y ), . . . , O(Xn, Y )) = M(X1Y, . . . ,XnY ) = YM(X1, . . . ,Xn) = O(M(X1, . . . ,Xn), Y )\nConversely, if the Identity (18) holds, it follows that\nM(\u03b1X1, . . . , \u03b1Xn) = M(O(\u03b1,X1), . . . , O(\u03b1,Xn)) = O(\u03b1,M(X1, . . . ,Xn)) = \u03b1M(X1, . . . ,Xn)\nTherefore, M is homogeneous of order [1, 1]."}, {"heading": "4.1 Some properties of IV-GOWA operators", "text": "In the following results, we show how some of the most important properties demanded to real-valued OWA are also fulfilled by IV-GOWA operators.\nProposition 33 Let O and M be as in Definition 31.
