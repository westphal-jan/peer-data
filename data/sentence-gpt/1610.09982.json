INTRODUCTION\nData mining is a process of mined valuable data from a large set of data. Several analysis tools of data mining (like, clustering, classification, regression etc,) can be used for sentiment analysis task [13][14]. Sentiment mining is one of the important aspects of data mining\nwhere important data can be mined based on the positive or negative senses of the collected data. Sentiment Analysis also known as Opinion Mining refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis and computational linguistic to identify and extract subjective information in source materials. Here the source materials refer to opinions / reviews /comments given in various social networking sites [1].The Sentiment found within comments, feedback or critiques provide useful indicators for many different purposes and can be categorized by polarity [2].By polarity we tend to find out if a review is overall a positive one or a negative one. For example:\n1) Positive Sentiment in subjective sentence: \u201cI\nloved the movie Mary Kom\u201d\u2014This sentence is expressed positive sentiment about the movie Mary Kom and we can decide that from the sentiment threshold value of word \u201cloved\u201d. So, threshold value of word \u201cloved\u201d has positive numerical threshold value.\n2) Negative sentiment in subjective sentences:\n\u201cPhata poster nikla hero is a flop movie\u201d defined sentence is expressed negative sentiment about the movie named \u201cPhata poster nikla hero\u201d and we can decide that from the sentiment threshold value of word \u201cflop\u201d. So, threshold value of word \u201cflop\u201d has negative numerical threshold value. Sentiment Analysis is of three different types: Document level, Sentence level and Entity level. However we are studying phrase level sentiment analysis. The traditional text mining concentrates on analysis of facts whereas opinion mining deals with the attitudes [3]. The main fields of research are sentiment classification, feature based sentiment classification and opinion summarizing. Now, the use of sentiment analysis in a commercial environment is growing. This is evident in the increasing number of\nbrand tracking and marketing companies offering this service. Some services include:\n- Tracking users and non-users opinions and ratings on\nproducts and services.\n- Monitoring issues confronting the company so as\nto prevent viral effects.\n- Assessing market buzz, competitor activity and customer trends, fads and fashion.\n- Measuring public response to an activity or company\nrelated issue [4].\nIn this paper for Sentiment Analysis we are\nusing two Supervised Machine Learning algorithms : Na\u00efve Bayes\u2019 and K-Nearest Neighbour to calculate the accuracies, precisions (of positive and negative corpuses) and recall values (of positive and negative corpuses). The difficulties in Sentiment Analysis are an opinion word which is treated as positive side may be considered as negative in another situation. Also the degree of positivity or negativity also has a great impact on the opinions. For example \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cvery good\u201d cannot be treated same.[2] Although the traditional text processing says that a small change in two pieces of text does not change the meaning of the sentences. However the latest text mining gives room for advanced analysis measuring the intensity of the word. Here is the point where we can scale the accuracy and efficiency of different algorithms [4]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 deals with the related work of our study, Section 3 presents our proposed work (Data sets and data sources used in our study along with the models and methodology used), Section 4 presents all our experimental results, Section 5 presents the conclusion drawn from our survey.\nII. RELATED WORK\nSeveral techniques were used for Sentiment Analysis. Few Related work are as follow: (a)Mori Rimon[3] used the keyword based approach to classify sentiment. He worked on identifying keywords basically adjectives which indicates the sentiment. Such indicators can be prepared manually or derived from Wordnet. (b)Alec co [4] used different machine learning algorithms such as Na\u00efve Bayes\u2019, Support vector machine and maximum entropy. (c)Janice M. Weibe [5] performed document and sentence level classification. He fetched review data from different product destinations such as automobiles, banks, movies and travel. He classified the words into positive and negative categories. He then calculated the overall positive or negative score for the text. If the number of positive words is more than negative then the document is considered positive otherwise negative. (d) Jalaj S. Modha , Gayatri S. Pandi and Sandip J. Modha [6] worked on techniques of handling both subjective as well as objective unstructured data. (e) Theresa Wilson, Janyce Wiebe and Paul Hoffman [7] worked on a new approach on sentiment analysis by first determining whether an expression is neutral or\npolar and then disambiguates the polarity of the polar expression. With this approach the system is able to automatically identify the contextual polarity for a large subset of sentiment expressions, hence achieving results which are better than baseline.\nII. PROPOSED WORK"}, {"heading": "A) Data source and Data Set", "text": "To conduct the research, two datasets are considered here - Movie Reviews & Hotel Reviews.\n All the movie reviews have been scanned from\nwww.imdb.com.\n All the hotel reviews have been downloaded\nfrom OpinRank Review Dataset\n(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/OpinRank\n+Review+Dataset)\nThe data set has been prepared by taking 5000 positive\nand 5000 negative reviews from each of the mentioned\nsites."}, {"heading": "B) Methodology", "text": "The main goal of the research is to analyse the data from the surveys and to decide whether it is suitable to be analysed with the use of the discussed data mining methods. A graphical description of the processes involve in sentiment analysis is detailed in Figure 1 below.\nknowledge and observed data can be combined. In Na\u00efve Bayes\u2019 technique, the basic idea to find the probabilities of categories given a text document by using the joint probabilities of words and categories. It is based on the assumption of word independence. The starting point is the Bayes\u2019 theorem for conditional probability, stating that, for a given data point x and class C: P (C / x) = P(x/C)/P(x) ( 1)\nFurthermore, by making the assumption that for\na data point x = {x1,x2,...xj}, the probability of each of its attributes occurring in a given class is independent, we can estimate the probability of x as follows:\nP(C/x)=P(C).\u220fP(xi/C) (2)\nAlgorithm\nInput: a document d\nA fixed set of classes C={c1,c2,\u2026,cj}\nOutput: a predicted class cC\nSteps: 1. Pre-processing: i. About 10,000 reviews were crawled from www.imdb.com / OpinRank Review Dataset ii. Positive reviews and negative reviews were kept in two files pos.txt and neg.txt iii. 2 empty lists were taken, one for positive and one for negative reviews. iv. Sentences of the positive and negative reviews were broken and \u2018pos\u2019 and \u2018neg\u2019 were appended to each accordingly and were stored in the 2 empty lists created. v. \u00be of these sentences were kept in the dictionary for training while the \u00bc were kept for testing. 2. Using chi squared test (explained later) we\ncalculated the score of each of the remaining words and\ninstead of using all of those words we only used the\nbest 10,000.\n3. The classifier was trained using the dataset just\nprepared.\n4. Labelled sentences were kept correctly in reference\nsets and the predicatively labelled version in test sets.\n5. Metrics were calculated accordingly.\nFig 2.

It is non parametric method used for classification or regression. In case of classification the output is class membership (the most prevalent cluster may be returned) , the object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbours, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbours. This rule simply retains the entire training set during learning and assigns to each query a class represented by the majority label of its k-nearest neighbours in the training set. The Nearest Neighbour rule (NN) is the simplest form of K-NN when K = 1. Given an unknown sample and a training set, all the distances between the unknown sample and all the samples in the training set can be computed. The distance with the smallest value corresponds to the sample in the training set closest to the unknown sample. Therefore, the unknown sample may be classified based on the classification of this nearest neighbour. The K-NN is an easy algorithm to\nunderstand and implement , and a powerful tool we have at our disposal for sentiment analysis. KNN is powerful because it does not assume anything about the data, other than a distance measure can be calculated consistently between two instances. As such, it is called non-parametric or non-linear as it does not assume a functional form. The flowchart of k-nn classifier is given in Fig.3.\nAlgorithm:"}, {"heading": "1. Pre-processing:", "text": "i). About 10,000 reviews were crawled from www.imdb.com/OpinRank Review Dataset ii.

Training:\ni. Using chi squared test we calculated the score of\neach of the words occurring in the training dataset.\nii. An empty list is created, the dictionary in which the\nwords from training dataset are stored followed by each of their scores thus calculated. ii. for each test review iii. for each word\niv. If it exists in the word score list, add its score to\nreview score\nv. Else find the word in word score list with minimum\njaccard index to the unknown word and add its score to\nthe review score.\nvi. End for at step 3\nvii. End for at step 4\nviii. Find metrics accordingly.\nChi squared test:\n1. Initialize an empty frequency distribution. 2. Initialize an empty conditional frequency distribution (based on words being positive and negative). 3. We fill out the frequency distributions, incrementing the counter of each word within the appropriate distribution. 4. We find the highest-information features is the count of words in positive reviews, words in negative reviews, and total words. 5. We use a chi-squared test (also from NLTK) to score the words. We find each word\u2019s positive information score and negative information score, add them up, and fill up a dictionary correlating the words and scores, which we then return out of the function.\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nAccuracy, Precision and recall are method used for evaluating the performance of opinion mining. Here accuracy is the overall accuracy of certain sentiment models. Recall (Pos) and Precision (Pos) are the ratio and precision ratio for true positive reviews. Recall (Neg) and Precision (Neg) are the ratio and precision ratio for true negative reviews. In an ideal scenario, all the experimental results are measured according to the Table 1.and accuracy, Precision and recall as explained below [9].\nThe overall accuracies of the three algorithms in 10 rounds of experiments are indicated in Table 2 and Fig.4,\nTable 2.

CONCLUSION\nThe aim of study is to evaluate the performance for sentiment classification in terms of accuracy, precision and recall. In this paper, we compared two supervised machine learning algorithms of Na\u00efve Bayes\u2019 and KNN for sentiment classification of the movie reviews and hotel reviews. The experimental results show that the classifiers yielded better results for the movie reviews with the Na\u00efve Bayes\u2019 approach giving above 80% accuracies and outperforming than the k-NN approach. However for the hotel reviews, the accuracies are much lower and both the classifiers yielded similar results. Thus we can say Na\u00efve Bayes\u2019 classifier can be used successfully to analyse movie reviews.\nVI. FUTURE WORK\nFor further work we would like to compare try and come up with an efficient sentiment analyser like random forest, Support vector Machine etc. And also try to implement a new algorithm utilizing the benefits of the both algorithms so that it can be used effectively in data forecasting.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Lina L.

Such content is often found in social media web sites in the form of movie or product reviews, user comments, testimonials, messages in discussion forums etc. Timely discovery of the sentimental or opinionated web content has a number of advantages, the most important of all being monetization. Understanding of the sentiments of human masses towards different entities and products enables better services for contextual advertisements, recommendation systems and analysis of market trends. The focus of our project is sentiment focussed web crawling framework to facilitate the quick discovery of sentimental contents of movie reviews and hotel reviews and analysis of the same. We use statistical methods to capture elements of subjective style and the sentence polarity. The paper elaborately discusses two supervised machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbour(K-NN) and Na\u00efve Bayes\u2019 and compares their overall accuracy, precisions as well as recall values. It was seen that in case of movie reviews Na\u00efve Bayes\u2019 gave far better results than K-NN but for hotel reviews these algorithms gave lesser, almost same", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
