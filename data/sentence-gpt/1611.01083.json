Word Sense Disambiguation is used to find meaning of words based on live contexts using supervised and unsupervised approaches. Unsupervised approaches use online dictionary for learning, and supervised approaches use manual learning sets for learning and training on the topic of mental illness. Here, we use a set of supervised and unsupervised tools to test for the use of word use in the face of a common problem, such as anxiety or depression. We also use a group of trained participants to measure the use of word meanings, by using a set of online dictionaries that are often used to detect specific contexts that may contain words that may have the same meaning and to be related. In some cases, the term \u201cfantasy\u202c is used to predict the meaning of words based on their meaning and to be related. The aim of this paper is to identify ways to develop a simple dictionary and learn more about the use of word meanings.\n\n\n\n\nWe are currently studying the use of word meanings in human speech. We are considering ways to evaluate whether to use word meanings in speech or speech to predict that words might have an effect on the sentence structure of the sentence structure.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "In human languages all over the world, there are a lot of words having different meaning depending on the contexts. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) [1-5] is the process for identification of probable meaning of ambiguous words based on distinct situations. The word \u201cBank\u201d has several meaning, such as \u201cplace for monitory transaction\u201d, \u201creservoir\u201d, \u201cturning point of a river\u201d, and so on. Such words with multiple meaning are ambiguous in nature. The process of identification to decide appropriate meaning of an ambiguous word for a particular context is known as WSD. People decide the meaning of a word based on the characteristic points of a discussion or situation using their own merits. Machines have no ability to decide such an ambiguous situation unless some protocols have been planted into the machines\u2019 memory.\nIn supervised learning, a learning set is considered for the system to predict the meaning of ambiguous words using a few sentences having a specific meaning of the particular ambiguous words. Specific learning set is generated as a result for each instance of different meaning. A system finds the probable meaning of an ambiguous word for the particular context based on defined learning set. In this method, learning set is created manually unable to generate fixed rules for specific system. Therefore predicted meaning of an ambiguous word in a given context can't be always detected. Supervised learning is capable to derive partial predicted result, if the\nlearning set does not contain sufficient information for all possible senses of the ambiguous word. It shows the result, only if there is information in the predefined database [6-7].\nIn unsupervised learning, online dictionary is taken as learning set avoiding the inefficiency of supervised learning. \u201cWordNet\u201d is the most widely used online dictionary [8-14] maintaining \u201cwords and related meanings\u201d as well as \u201crelations among different words\u201d.\nThe WSD process is important for different applications such as information retrieval [15], automated classification [16] and so on. WSD plays an important role in the field of language translation by machine [17-19].\nTwo typical algorithms \u201cLesk\u201d [20, 21] and \u201cBag-of-Words\u201d [6] are coupled in this paper with some modification.\nThe organization of rest of the paper is as follows: Section 2 is about the related activities of our paper, based on the existing methods; Background of the paper is briefly mentioned in Section 3; Section 4 describes the proposed approach with algorithmic description; Section 5 depicts experimental results along with comparison; Section 6 represents the conclusion of the paper."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "Many algorithms have been designed in WSD based on supervised and unsupervised learning. \u201cLesk\u201d and \u201cBag-of-Words\u201d are two well-known methods which are discussed in this section as the basis of our proposed approach."}, {"heading": "2.1. Preliminaries of Lesk", "text": "Typical Lesk approach selects a short phrase from the sentence containing an ambiguous word. Then, dictionary definition (gloss) of each of the senses for ambiguous word is compared with glosses of other words in that particular phrase. An ambiguous word is being assigned with the particular sense, whose gloss has highest frequency (number of words in common) with the glosses of other words of the phrase.\nExample 1: \u201cRam and Sita everyday go to bank for withdrawal of money.\u201d Here, the phrase is taken depending on window size (number of consecutive words). If window size is 3, then the phrase would be \u201cgo bank withdrawal\u201d. All other words are being discarded as \u201cstop words\u201d. Consider the glosses of all words presented in that particular phrase are as follows: The number of senses of \u201cBank\u201d is \u20182\u2019 such as \u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 (refer Table 1).

PROPOSED APPROACH", "text": "Our proposed approach is based on the \u201cModified Lesk\u201d and \u201cBag-of-Words\u201d approaches which are already defined in Section 3. Design of our approach is presented in form of flow chart and algorithms in this section. This approach is designed to achieve a disambiguated result with higher precision values.\nIn our approach, \u201cstop words\u201d like \u2018a\u2019, \u2018an\u2019, \u2018the\u2019, etc. are being discarded from input texts as these words meaningless to derive the \u201csense\u201d of the particular sentence. Then, the text containing meaningful words (excluding the stop words) is passed through \u201cBag-of-Words\u201d and \u201cModified Lesk\u201d algorithms in a parallel fashion. \u201cBag-of-Words\u201d algorithm is considered as \u201cModule 1\u201d; and, \u201cModified Lesk\u201d is considered as \u201cModule 2\u201d. These two algorithms are responsible to find the actual sense of ambiguous words in the particular context. The unmatched words in both these algorithms are being stored in a temporary database for further usage. After that, results of \u201cModule 1\u201d and \u201cModule 2\u201d have been being analysed to formulate the particular sense depending on the context of the sentence in \u201cModule 3\u201d. If at least either of the algorithms (using \u201cModule 1\u201d or \u201cModule 2\u201d) find the sense applying logical \u201cOR\u201d operation on the projected results, then particular sense is assigned to the unmatched words in the temporary database. Correctness of results based on the implemented algorithms is checked in \u201cModule 4\u201d. If both algorithms derive same result obtained by applying \u201cAND\u201d operation on two results of \u201cModule 1\u201d and \u201cModule 2\u201d, then the sense is considered as disambiguated sense. Therefore, unmatched words (kept in a temporary database) has to be moved to related sense bag as per the \u201cBag-of-Words\u201d algorithm in \u201cModule 1\u201d to participate in disambiguation method now onwards. Otherwise, the derived senses are considered as the probable senses and unmatched words are being moved to an anticipated database in \u201cModule 5\u201d. Figure 1 shows the modular division of our proposed approach. If the occurrence of a word in the anticipated database with a particular sense crosses specified threshold, the word is considered to be used for decision making and is moved to the related sense bag of the \u201cBag-of-Words\u201d algorithm in \u201cModule 1\u201d to participate in disambiguation.\nAlgorithm 1 is the overall procedure for the disambiguation of words (refer Figure 1). Each module performs a particular task which is mentioned in next algorithms.\nAlgorithm 1: Word_Sense_Disambiguation_Process\nInput: Text containing ambiguous word Output: Text with derived sense of ambiguous word to achieve disambiguated word Step 1: Input text is submitted. Step 2: All stop words like \u2018a\u2019, \u2018an\u2019, \u2018the\u2019, etc. are erased. Step 3: Text with only meaningful words, are passed to Module 1 & Module 2. Step 4: The sense of an ambiguous word is formulated in Module 3. Step 5: Correctness of the derived sense is checked in Module 4.\nStep 6: The disambiguated sense is achieved as result; and, learning set is enriched in Module 5 using new data available in Module 4. Step 7: Stop.\nAlgorithm 2 is based on Module 1 and it tries to find the sense of an ambiguous word using Bagof-Words approach (refer Figure 2).\nAlgorithm 2: Find_Sense_in_Bag_of_Words\nInput: Text with only meaningful words Output: Actual sense of ambiguous words Step 1: Loop Start for each meaningful word of input texts. Step 2: Each word is selected from preliminary input texts. Step 3: If the word is matched with the word of any sense bags, then associated counter is increased. Step 4: Else, unmatched word is stored in a temporary database. Step 5: Loop End Step 6: If the counter value is mismatched with all other values, then associated sense is considered as the disambiguated sense. Step 7: Else, Bag-of-Words algorithm fails to disambiguate the sense. Step 8: Stop.\nAlgorithm 3 is based on Module 2 and it finds the sense of an ambiguous word using Modified Lesk (refer Figure 3).\nAlgorithm 3: Find_Sense_in_Modified_Lesk\nInput: Text with only meaningful words Output: Actual sense of the ambiguous word Step 1: Loop Start for all glosses (dictionary definitions) of the ambiguous word. Step 2: Ambiguous word is selected. Step 3: Gloss of ambiguous word is obtained from typical WordNet. Step 4: Intersection is performed between the meaningful words from the input text and the glosses of the ambiguous word. Step 5: Loop End Step 6: If If the counter value is mismatched with all other values, then associated sense is considered as the disambiguated sense. Step 7: Else, Modified Lesk algorithm fails to sense disambiguated word; and, unmatched words are stored in temporary database (in Module 1). Step 8: Stop.\nAlgorithm 4 is designed based on Module 3. It formulates actual sense of the ambiguous word using results from previous two modules (refer Figure 4). If at least one of the two approaches can derive the sense, that is considered as the disambiguated sense.\nAlgorithm 4: Sense_Formulate\nInput: Results from Module 1 and Module 2 Output: Result of \u201cOR\u201d operation Step 1: \u201cOR\u201d operation is applied on two results of Module 1 and Module 2. Step 2: Check whether the derived sense is disambiguated by at least by Module 1 or Module 2. Step 3: If result is \u20181\u2019, it means that the sense is obtained from at least one of the algorithms or both of the algorithms. Then, the particular sense is assigned to each of unmatched words within temporary database. Then, go to Module 4. Step 4: Else, both the algorithms fail to disambiguate the sense. Step 5: Stop.\nAlgorithm 5 is designed based on Module 4. It finds the correctness of disambiguated sense (refer Figure 5) using \u201cAND\u201d operation, derived by Module 1 and Module 2. If both approaches derive same sense, the result of \u201cAND\u201d operation is \u20181\u2019. Otherwise, for all other cases, the result is \u20180\u2019.\nAlgorithm 5: Find_Sense_Precision\nInput: Results from Module 1 and Module 2 Output: Result of \u201cAND\u201d operation Step 1: Collect the results of Module 1 and Module 2 Step 2: \u201cAND\u201d operation is applied on the results of Module 1 and Module 2 Step 3: If result is 1 (both the approaches produce same results), then derived sense is displayed as the disambiguated sense. Step 4: Else, derived sense is displayed as a probable sense. Step 5: Stop.\nAlgorithm 6 is designed based on Module 5 activities. It enriches the learning set by populating with words from temporary database (refer Figure 6).\nAlgorithm 6: Learning_Set_Enrichment\nInput: Sense assigned unmatched words from temporary database Output: Enriched learning set Step1: Result of \u201cAND\u201d operation from Module 4 is received as input. Step 2: If the result is 1, then sense assigned unmatched words from temporary database are moved to specific BOW database. Step 3: Else, sense assigned unmatched words are moved from temporary database to an anticipated database. Step 4: If occurrence of an unmatched word in anticipated database having a particular sense crosses the threshold value, then the word is moved to the related BOW database. Step 5: Stop.\nThe key feature of this algorithm is based on the auto enrichment property of the learning set. For the first time, if any word is not present in the learning set, it could not be able for participation for disambiguation. Though, its probable meaning would be stored in the database. When the number of occurrences of the particular word with a particular sense crosses specific threshold value, the word is inserted in the learning set to take part in disambiguation procedure. Therefore, the efficiency of the disambiguation process is increased by this auto increment property of the learning set."}, {"heading": "5.

Word Sense Disambiguation is used to find meaning of words based on live contexts using supervised and unsupervised approaches. Unsupervised approaches use online dictionary for learning, and supervised approaches use manual learning sets. Hand tagged data are populated which might not be effective and sufficient for learning procedure. This limitation of information is main flaw of the supervised approach. Our proposed approach focuses to overcome the limitation using learning set which is enriched in dynamic way maintaining new data. Trivial filtering method is utilized to achieve appropriate training data. We introduce a mixed methodology having \u201cModified Lesk\u201d approach and \u201cBag-of-Words\u201d having enriched bags using learning methods.
