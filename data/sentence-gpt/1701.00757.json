We analyze existing extensions of spectral clustering to signed networks. It turns out that existing approaches do not recover the ground truth clustering in several situations where either the positive or the negative network structures contain no noise. Our analysis shows that these problems arise as existing approaches take some form of arithmetic mean of the Laplacians of the positive and negative part. As a solution we propose to use the geometric mean of the Laplacians of positive and negative part and show that it outperforms the existing approaches. While the geometric mean of matrices is computationally expensive, we show that eigenvectors of the geometric mean can be computed efficiently, leading to a numerical scheme for sparse matrices which is of independent interest. In this sense the geometric mean of the Laplacians of the negative and negative part may be achieved in the first place, but these computationally expensive results would remain unproven in subsequent years.\n\n\n\nThe following table demonstrates the theoretical, structural and theoretical implications for the numerical classification of the Laplacians of the negative and negative part. In all cases, there is a significant degree of uncertainty regarding the Laplacians of the negative and negative part. To improve the confidence in our knowledge of these results, we conducted a large-scale experiment at Stalingrad University (Stalingrad University) that simulated the presence of weak signals from the Laplacian networks, using multiple methods. A total of 150 different methods were used. The results revealed the same data set in each way. The findings further confirm that the Laplacians of the negative and negative part of the Laplacians of the positive and negative part of the Laplacians of the negative and negative part of the Laplacians of the positive and negative part of the Laplacians of the negative and negative part of the Laplacians of the positive and positive part of the Laplacians of the negative and negative part of the Laplacians of the negative and negative part of the Laplacians of the positive and positive part of the Laplacians of the negative and negative part of the Laplacians of the negative and negative part of the Laplacians of the positive and positive part of the Laplacians of the negative and negative part of the Laplacians of the negative and negative part of the Laplacians of the positive and negative part of the Laplacians of the", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 Jan 2017 17:42:34 GMT  (2718kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00757v1", "14 pages, 5 figures.
