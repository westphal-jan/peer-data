Introduction", "text": "The main claim of this paper is that the Christoffel function (a tool from Approximation Theory) can prove to be very useful in statistics and Machine learning applications. The Christoffel function is associated with a finite measure and a degree parameter d. It has an important history of research with strong connection to orthogonal polynomials (Szego, 1974; Dunkl and Xu, 2001), interpolation and approximation theory (Nevai, 1986; De Marchi et al., 2014). Its typical asymptotic behavior as d increases is of particular interest because, in some specific settings, it provides very relevant information on the support and the density of the associated input measure. Important references include Ma\u0301te\u0301 and Nevai (1980); Ma\u0301te\u0301 et al. (1991); Totik (2000); Gustafsson et al. (2009) in a single dimension, Bos (1994); Bos et al. (1998); Xu (1999); Berman (2009); Kroo and Lubinsky (2013) for specific multivariate settings and Kroo and Lubinsky (2012) for ratii of mutually absolutely continuous measures. The topic is still a subject of active research, but regarding properties of the Christoffel function, a lot of information is already available.\nThe present work shows how properties of the Christoffel function can be used successfully in some statistics and Machine Learning applications. To the best of our our knowledge, this is the first attempt in such a context with the recent work of Lasserre and\nar X\niv :1\n70 1.\n02 88\n6v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 3\nPauwels (2016) and Malyshkin (2015). More precisely, we consider the empirical Christoffel function, a specific case where the input measure is a scaled counting measure uniformly supported on a set (a cloud) of datapoints. This methodology has three distinguishing features: (i) It is extremely simple and involves no optimization procedure, (ii) it scales linearly with the number of observations (one pass over the data is sufficient), and (iii) it is affine invariant. These three features prove to be especially important in all the applications that we consider.\nIn Lasserre and Pauwels (2016) we have exhibited a striking property of some distinguished family of sum-of-squares (SOS) polynomials (Qd)d\u2208N, indexed by their degree (2d \u2208 N), and easily computed from empirical moments associated with a cloud of n points in Rp which we call X. The associated family of sublevel sets S\u03b1,d = {x : Qd(x) \u2264 \u03b1}, for various values of \u03b1 > 0, approximates the global shape of original cloud of points X. The degree index d can be used as a tuning parameter, trading off regularity of the polynomial Qd with the fitness of the approximation of the shape of X (as long as the cloud contains sufficiently many points). Remarkably, even with relatively low degree d, the sets S\u03b1,d capture acurately the shape of X, and so provides a compact (algebraic) encoding of the cloud.\nIn fact the reciprocal function x 7\u2192 Qd(x)\u22121 is precisely the Christoffel function \u039b\u00b5n,d associated to the empirical counting measure supported on X and the degree index d. Some properties of the Christoffel function stemming from approximation theory suggest that it could be exploited in a statistical learning context by considering its empirical counterpart. The purpose of this work is to push this idea further. In particular we investigate (a) further properties of the Christoffel function which prove to be relevant in some machine learning applications, (b) statistical properties of the empirical Christoffel function as well as (c) further applications to well known machine learning tasks.\nContributions\nThis paper significantly extends Lasserre and Pauwels (2016) in several directions. Indeed our contribution is threefold:\nI. We first provide a thresholding scheme which allows to approximate the compact support S of a measure with strong asymptotic guarantees. This result rigorously establishes the property that, as d increases, the scaled Christoffel function decreases to zero outside S and remains positive in the interior of S.\nII. In view of potential applications in statistics and machine learning we provide a rationale for using the empirical Christoffel function in place of its population counterpart in the limit of large sample size. We consider a compactly supported population measure \u00b5 as well as an empirical measure \u00b5n uniformly supported on a sample of n vectors in Rp, drawn independently from \u00b5. For each fixed d we show a highly desirable strong asymptotic property as n increases. Namely, the empirical Christofell function \u039b\u00b5n,d(\u00b7) converges, uniformly in x \u2208 Rp, to \u039b\u00b5,d(\u00b7), almost-surely with respect to the draw of the random sample.\nIII. We illustrate the benefits of the empirical Christoffel function in some important applications, mainly in statistics and machine learning. The rationale for such benefits builds on approximation properties of the Christoffel function combined with our consistency\nresult. In particular, we first show on simulated data that the Christoffel function can be useful for density estimation and support inference. In Lasserre and Pauwels (2016) we have described how the Christoffel function yields a simple procedure for intrusion detection in networks, and here we extend these results by performing a numerical comparison with well established methods for novelty detection on a real world dataset. Finally we show that the Christoffel function is also very useful to perform affine matching and inverse affine shuffling of a dataset.\nOrganisation of the paper\nSection 2 describes the notation and definitions which will be used throughout the paper. In Section 3 we introduce the Christoffel function, outline some of its known properties and describe our main theoretical results. Applications are presented in Section 4 where we consider both simulated and real world data as well as a comparison with well established machine learning methods.

Notation, definitions and Preliminary results", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Notation and definitions", "text": "We fix the ambient dimension to be p throughout the text. For example, we will manipulate vectors in Rp as well as p-variate polynomials with real coefficients. We denote by X a set of p variables X1, . . . , Xp which we will use in mathematical expressions defining polynomials. We identify monomials from the canonical basis of p-variate polynomials with their exponents in Np: we associate to \u03b1 = (\u03b1i)i=1...p \u2208 Np the monomial X\u03b1 := X\u03b111 X \u03b12 2 . . . X \u03b1p p which degree is deg(\u03b1) := \u2211p i=1 \u03b1i = |\u03b1|. We use the expressions <gl and \u2264gl to denote the graded lexicographic order, a well ordering over p-variate monomials. This amounts to, first, use the canonical order on the degree and, second, break ties in monomials with the same degree using the lexicographic order with X1 = a,X2 = b . . . For example, the monomials in two variables X1, X2, of degree less or equal to 3 listed in this order are given by: 1, X1, X2, X 2 1 , X1X2, X 2 2 , X 3 1 , X 2 1X2, X1X 2 2 , X 3 2 .\nWe denote by Npd, the set {\u03b1 \u2208 N p; deg(\u03b1) \u2264 d} ordered by \u2264gl. R[X] denotes the set of p-variate polynomials: linear combinations of monomials with real coefficients. The degree of a polynomial is the highest of the degrees of its monomials with nonzero coefficients1. We use the same notation, deg(\u00b7), to denote the degree of a polynomial or of an element of Np. For d \u2208 N, R[X]d denotes the set of p-variate polynomials of degree at most d. We set s(d) = ( p+d d ) , the number of monomials of degree less or equal to d.\nWe will denote by vd(X) the vector of monomials of degree less or equal to d sorted by \u2264gl, i.e., vd(X) := (X\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208Npd \u2208 R[X] s(d) d . With this notation, we can write a polynomial P \u2208 R[X]d as P (X) = \u3008p,vd(X)\u3009 for some real vector of coefficients p = (p\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208Npd \u2208 R s(d) ordered using \u2264gl. Given x = (xi)i=1...p \u2208 Rp, P (x) denotes the evaluation of P with the assignments X1 = x1, X2 = x2, . . . Xp = xp. Given a Borel probability measure \u00b5 and\n1. For the null polynomial, we use the convention that its degree is 0 and it is \u2264gl smaller than all other monomials.\n\u03b1 \u2208 Np, y\u03b1(\u00b5) denotes the moment \u03b1 of \u00b5, i.e., y\u03b1(\u00b5) = \u222b Rp x\n\u03b1d\u00b5(x). Finally for \u03b4 > 0 and every x \u2208 Rp, let B\u03b4(x) := {x : \u2016x\u2016 \u2264 \u03b4} be the closed Euclidean ball of radius \u03b4 and centered at x. We use the shorthand notation B to denote the closed Euclidean unit ball. Recall that its Lebesgue volume vol(B\u03b4(x)) satisfies:\nvol(B\u03b4(x)) = \u03c0 p 2 \u0393 (p 2 + 1 )\u03b4p, \u2200x \u2208 Rp.\nFurthermore, let \u03c9p := 2\u03c0\np+1 2\n\u0393( p+12 ) denote the surface of the p dimensional unit sphere in\nRp+1. Throughout the paper, we will only consider measures of which all moments are finite.\nMoment matrix\nFor a finite Borel measure \u00b5 on Rp denote by sup(\u00b5) its support, i.e., the smallest closed set \u2126 \u2282 Rp such that \u00b5(Rp \\\u2126) = 0. The moment matrix of \u00b5, Md(\u00b5), is a matrix indexed by monomials of degree at most d ordered by \u2264gl. For \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 Npd, the corresponding entry in Md(\u00b5) is defined by Md(\u00b5)\u03b1,\u03b2 := y\u03b1+\u03b2(\u00b5), the moment \u222b x\u03b1+\u03b2d\u00b5 of \u00b5. When p = 2, letting y\u03b1 = y\u03b1(\u00b5) for \u03b1 \u2208 N24, we have\nM2(\u00b5) :\n1 X1 X2 X 2 1 X1X2 X 2 2\n1 1 y10 y01 y20 y11 y02 X1 y10 y20 y11 y30 y21 y12 X2 y01 y11 y02 y21 y12 y03 X21 y20 y30 y21 y40 y31 y22 X1X2 y11 y21 y12 y31 y22 y13 X22 y02 y12 y03 y22 y13 y04 .\nThe matrix Md(\u00b5) is positive semidefinite for all d \u2208 N. Indeed, for any p \u2208 Rs(d), let P \u2208 R[X]d be the polynomial with vector of coefficients p; then pTMd(\u00b5)p = \u222b Rp P (x)\n2d\u00b5(x) \u2265 0. We also have the identity Md(\u00b5) = \u222b Rp vd(x)vd(x)\nTd\u00b5(x) where the integral is understood elementwise.\nSum of squares (SOS)\nWe denote by \u03a3[X] \u2282 R[X] (resp. \u03a3[X]d \u2282 R[X]d), the set of polynomials (resp. polynomials of degree at most d) which can be written as a sum of squares of polynomials. Let P \u2208 R[X]2m for some m \u2208 N, then P belongs to \u03a3[X]2m if there exists a finite J \u2282 N and a family of polynomials Pj \u2208 R[X]m, j \u2208 J , such that P = \u2211 j\u2208J P 2 j . It is obvious that sum of squares polynomials are always nonnegative. A further interesting property is that this class of polynomials is connected with positive semidefiniteness. Indeed, P belongs to \u03a3[X]2m if and only if\n\u2203Q \u2208 Rs(m)\u00d7s(m), Q = QT , Q 0, P (x) = vm(x)TQvm(x), \u2200x \u2208 Rp. (2.1)\nAs a consequence, every real symmetric positive semidefinite matrix Q \u2208 Rs(m)\u00d7s(m) defines a polynomial in \u03a3[X]2m by using the representation (2.1).\nOrthonormal polynomials\nWe define a classical (Szego, 1974; Dunkl and Xu, 2001) family of orthonormal polynomials, {P\u03b1}\u03b1\u2208Npd ordered according to \u2264gl, which satisfies for all \u03b1 \u2208 N p d\n\u3008P\u03b1, P\u03b2\u3009\u00b5 = \u03b4\u03b1=\u03b2, \u3008P\u03b1, X\u03b2\u3009\u00b5 = 0, if \u03b2 <gl \u03b1, \u3008P\u03b1, X\u03b1\u3009\u00b5 > 0. (2.2)\nExistence and uniqueness of such a family is guaranteed by the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process following the \u2264gl ordering on monomials and by the positivity of the moment matrix, see for instance Dunkl and Xu (2001) Theorem 3.1.11.\nLet Dd(\u00b5) be the lower triangular matrix of which rows are the coefficients of the polynomials P\u03b1 defined in (2.2) ordered by \u2264gl. It can be shown that Dd(\u00b5) = Ld(\u00b5)\u2212T , where Ld(\u00b5) is the Cholesky factorization of Md(\u00b5). Furthermore, there is a direct relation with the inverse moment matrix as Md(\u00b5) \u22121 = Dd(\u00b5) TDd(\u00b5) (Helton et al. (2008) Proof of Theorem 3.1)."}, {"heading": "3. The Christoffel function and its empirical counterpart", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 The Christoffel function", "text": "Let \u00b5 be a finite Borel measure on Rp with all moments finite and such that its moment matrix Md(\u00b5) is positive definite for every d = 0, 1, . . .. For every d, define the function \u03ba\u00b5,d : Rp \u00d7 Rp \u2192 R by:\n(x,y) 7\u2192 \u03ba\u00b5,d(x,y) := \u2211 \u03b1\u2208Npd P\u03b1(x)P\u03b1(y) = vd(x) TMd(\u00b5) \u22121vd(y), (3.1)\nwhere the family of polynomials {P\u03b1}\u03b1\u2208Npd is defined in (2.2) and the last equality follows from properties of this family (see also Lasserre and Pauwels (2016)). The kernel (x,y) 7\u2192 K(x,y) := \u2211 \u03b1\u2208Np P\u03b1(x)P\u03b1(y) is a reproducing kernel on L2(\u00b5) because\nP\u03b1(X) = \u222b K(X,y)P\u03b1(y) d\u00b5(y), \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 Np,\nthat is, the (P\u03b1) are eigenvectors of the associated operator on L2(\u00b5), and so\np(X) = \u222b K(X,y) p(y) d\u00b5(y), \u2200p \u2208 R[X].\nThe function x 7\u2192 \u039b\u00b5,d(x) := \u03ba\u00b5,d(x,x)\u22121 is called the Christoffel function associated with \u00b5 and d \u2208 N. The following result states a fundamental extremal property of the Christoffel function.\nTheorem 3.1 (see e.g. Dunkl and Xu (2001); Nevai (1986)) Let \u03be \u2208 Rp be fixed, arbitrary. Then\n\u039b\u00b5,d(\u03be) = min P\u2208R[X]d {\u222b Rp P (x)2 d\u00b5(x) : P (\u03be) = 1 } . (3.2)\nThe Christoffel function plays an important role in orthogonal polynomials and the theory of interpolation and approximation, see e.g. Szego (1974); Dunkl and Xu (2001). One is particularly interested in the asymptotics of the normalized Christoffel function x 7\u2192 s(d)\u039b\u00b5,d(x) as d \u2192 \u221e. The subject has a very long history in the univariate case, see Nevai (1986) for a detailed historical account prior to the 80\u2019s. The first quantitative asymptotic result was given in Ma\u0301te\u0301 and Nevai (1980) and was latter improved by Ma\u0301te\u0301 et al. (1991) and Totik (2000). In the multivariate setting, precise results are known in some particular cases such as balls, spheres and simplices (Bos, 1994; Bos et al., 1998; Xu, 1996, 1999; Kroo and Lubinsky, 2013) but much remains to be done for the general multivariate case. A typical example of asymptotic result is given under quite general (and technical) conditions in Kroo and Lubinsky (2013, 2012). This work shows that, as d\u2192\u221e, the limit of the ratii,\n\u039b\u03bd,d \u039b\u00b5,d , of two Christofell functions associated to two mutually absolutely continuous\nmeasures \u00b5 and \u03bd, converges to the density d\u03bdd\u00b5(x) on the interior of their common support.\nRemark 3.2 Notice that Theorem 3.1 also provides a mean to compute the numerical value \u039b\u00b5,d(x) for x \u2208 Rn, fixed, arbitrary. Then indeed (3.2) is a convex quadratic programming problem which can be solved efficiently, even in high dimension using first order methods such as projected gradient descent and its stochastic variants. This is particularly interesting when the nonsingular moment matrix Md(\u00b5) is large.\nWe next provide additional insights on Theorem 3.1 and solutions of (3.2).\nTheorem 3.3 For any \u03be \u2208 Rp, the optimization problem in (3.2) is convex with a unique optimal solution P \u2217d \u2208 R[X]d defined by\nP \u2217d (X) = \u03ba\u00b5,d(X, \u03be)\n\u03ba\u00b5,d(\u03be, \u03be) = \u039b\u00b5,d(\u03be)\u03ba\u00b5,d(X, \u03be). (3.3)\nIn addition,\n\u039b\u00b5,d(\u03be) = \u222b P \u2217d (x) 2 d\u00b5(x) = \u222b P \u2217d (x) d\u00b5(x) (3.4)\n\u039b\u00b5,d(\u03be)\u03be \u03b1 = \u222b x\u03b1 P \u2217d (x) d\u00b5(x) \u03b1 \u2208 N p d. (3.5)\nThe proof is postponed to Section 6. Interestingly, each of the orthonormal polynomials (P\u03b1)\u03b1\u2208Np also satisfies an important and well-known extremality property.\nTheorem 3.4 (see e.g. Szego (1974)) Let \u03b1 \u2208 Np be fixed, arbitrary and let d = |\u03b1|. Then up to a multiplicative positive constant, P\u03b1 is the unique optimal solution of\nmin P\u2208R[x]d  \u222b P 2(x) d\u00b5(x) : P (x) = x\u03b1 + \u2211 \u03b2<gl \u03b1 \u03b8\u03b2 x \u03b2 for some {\u03b8\u03b2}\u03b2<gl\u03b1  . (3.6) Finally, we hilight the following important property which will be useful in the sequel.\nTheorem 3.5 (See e.g. Lasserre and Pauwels (2016)) \u039b\u00b5,d is invariant by change of polynomial basis vd, change of the origin of Rp or change of basis in Rp."}, {"heading": "3.2 When \u00b5 is the Lebesgue measure", "text": "In this section we consider the important case of the Lebesgue measure on a compact set S \u2282 Rp such that cl(int(S)) = S. It is known that in this case the Christoffel function encodes information on the set S; see for example the discussion in Section 3.1. In particular, the scaled Christoffel function remains positive on the interior of S. We push this idea further and present a new result asserting that it is possible to recover the set S with strong asymptotic garanties by carefuly thresholding the corresponding scaled Christoffel function.\nFor any measurable set A, denote by \u00b5A the uniform probability measure on A, that is \u00b5A = \u03bbA/\u03bb(A) where \u03bb is the Lebesgue measure and \u03bbA is its restriction to A (\u03bbA(A\n\u2032) = \u03bbA\u2229A\u2032 for any measurable set A \u2032).\nThreshold and asymptotics\nThe main idea is to use quantitative lower bounds on the scaled Christoffel function, s(d)\u039b\u00b5S ,d, on the interior of S (Lemma 6.2) and upper bounds outside S (Lemma 6.6). In combining these bounds one proves the existence of a sequence of thresholds of the scaled Christoffel function which estimate S in a strongly consistent manner. Let us introduce the following notation and assumption.\nAssumption 3.6\n(a) S \u2282 Rp is a compact set such that cl(int(S)) = S.\n(b) {\u03b4k}k\u2208N is a decreasing sequence of positive numbers converging to 0. For every k \u2208 N, let dk be the smallest integer such that:\n2 3\u2212 \u03b4kdk\n\u03b4k+diam(S)dpk\n( e\np\n)p exp ( p2\ndk\n) \u2264 \u03b1k (3.7)\nwhere diam(S) denotes the diameter of the set S, and\n\u03b1k := \u03b4pk\u03c9p \u03bb(S)\n(dk + 1)(dk + 2)(dk + 3)\n(dk + p+ 1)(dk + p+ 2)(2dk + p+ 6)\nRemark 3.7 (On Assumption 3.6)\n\u2022 dk is well defined. Indeed, since \u03b4k is positive, the left hand side of (3.7) goes to 0 as k \u2192\u221e while the right hand side remains bounded for increasing values of dk.\n\u2022 From the definition of dk and the fact that \u03b4k is decreasing, the sequence {dk}k\u2208N is non decreasing.\n\u2022 Given {\u03b4k}k\u2208N, computing dk can be done recursively and only requires the knowledge of diam(S) and \u03bb(S).\n\u2022 A similar condition can be enforced if only upper bounds on diam(S) and on \u03bb(S) are available.

We proceed by distinguishing what happens far from S and close to S. First, Lemma 6.8 ensures that both Christoffel functions associated with \u00b5 and \u00b5n vanish far from S so that the influence of this region can be neglected.

Applications", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.1 Rationale", "text": "In this section we describe some applications for which properties of the Christoffel function prove to be very useful in a statistical context. We only consider the case of bounded support. A relevant property of the scaled Christoffel function is that it encodes information on the support and the density of a population measure \u00b5:\n\u2022 Ma\u0301te\u0301 et al. (1991), Totik (2000) and Kroo and Lubinsky (2012) provide asymptotic results involving the density of the input measure.\n\u2022 Theorem 3.8 provides asymptotic results related to the support of the input measure.\nThe support and density of a measure is of interest in many statistical applications. However, the aforementioned results are limited to population measures which are not accessible in a statistical setting. In the context of empirical Christoffel functions, Theorem 3.11 suggests that these properties still hold (at least in the limit of large samples) when one uses the empirical measure \u00b5n in place of the population measure \u00b5. Combining these ideas suggests to use of the empirical Chritoffel function in statistical applications such as (a) density estimation, (b) support inference or (c) outlier detection. This is illustrated on simulated and real world data and we compare the performance with well established methods for the same purpose. Finally, we also describe another application, namely inversion of affine shuffling, whose links with statistics are less clear.\nAll results presented in this section are mainly for illustrative purposes. In particular, the choice of the degree d as a function of the sample size n was done empirically and a precise quantitative analysis is a topic of future research beyond the scope of the present paper."}, {"heading": "4.2 Density estimation", "text": "Most asymptotic results regarding the scaled Christoffel function suggest that the limiting behaviour involves the product of a boundary effect term and a density term. Hence if one knows both the Christoffel function and the boundary effect term, one has access to the density term. Unfortunately, this boundary term is only known in specific situations, the most typical example being the Euclidean ball. Hence, in the present state of knowledge, one of the following is assumed to hold true.\n\u2022 The support of the population measure \u00b5 is S and limd\u2192\u221e s(d)\u039b\u03bbS ,d exists (possibly unknown).\n\u2022 The support is unknown but contains a set S with the same property as above. In this case, we consider the restriction of the population measure \u00b5 to S. Note that a sample from the restriction is easily obtained from a sample from \u00b5 by rejection.\nIn both cases, assuming that \u00b5 has a density h on S, it is expected that the ratii \u039b\u00b5,d\n\u039b\u03bbS,d or\ns(d)\u039b\u00b5,d limd\u2192\u221e s(d)\u039b\u03bbS,d , converge to h. An example of such a result in the univariate setting is the following.\nTheorem 4.1 (Theorem 5 Ma\u0301te\u0301 et al. (1991)) Suppose that \u00b5 is supported on [\u22121, 1] with density h \u2265 a > 0.

We perform the following experiment for given n, d \u2208 N.\n\u2022 Generate x1, . . . , xn \u2208 [\u22121, 1] sampled independently from \u00b5.\n\u2022 Compute and plot x\u2192 \u039b\u00b5n,d(x)\u039b\u03bbS,d(x) . Note that \u039b\u03bbS ,d is easily derived from the moments of the uniform distribution on [\u22121, 1].\nThe result is presented in Figure 1 and a comparison is given with a classical technique, kernel density estimation (Rosenblatt, 1956; Parzen, 1962) with the Gaussian kernel. The result suggest that empirical Christoffel based density estimation is competitive with kernel density estimation in this setting.

The results even suggest that a careful tuning of the degree d and the threshold level set \u03b1 allows to approximate the support extremely well for larger sample sizes. Of course the degree d should be chosen to avoid a form of over-fitting as the results suggest for small sample sizes and large values of d.

We follow the same line and consider the network intrusion detection task described in Williams et al. (2002) based on the KDD cup 99 dataset (Lichman, 2013). Following the pre-processing described in Williams et al. (2002); Lasserre and Pauwels (2016), we build up five datasets consisting of network connections represented by labeled vectors in R3 where each label indicates wether the connection was an attack or not.\nDataset http smtp ftp-data ftp other\nNumber of examples 567498 95156 30464 4091 5858 Proportions of attacks 0.004 0.0003 0.023 0.077 0.016\nAll the experiments described in this section are performed on the \u201cother\u201d dataset which is the most heterogeneous. The main task is to recover attacks from the collection of points in R3, ignoring the labels, and then compare the predictions with the ground thruth (given by the labels). We compare different methods, each of them assign a score to an individual, the higher the score, the more likely the individual is to be an outlier, or an attack. The metric that we use to compare different methods is the area under the Precision Recall curve (AUPR); see for example Davis and Goadrich (2006). We compare three different methods, each of them producing a score reflecting some degree of outlyingness.\n\u2022 Empirical Christoffel function.\n\u2022 Kernel density estimation (Rosenblatt, 1956; Parzen, 1962) with Gaussian kernel.

The value of the estimated decision function at each datapoint is used as an outlyingness score. We used the implementation provided in the kernlab package Zeileis et al. (2004).\nThe first two methods involve only a single parameter while the last method requires two parameters to be tuned. The results are given in Table 1 and the corresponding curves can be found in Section 6.4. Table 1 suggest that one-class SVM and the empirical Christoffel perform similarly and clearly outperform the kernel density estimation approach.

Suppose that we are given two matrices X \u2208 Rp\u00d7n and X\u2032 \u2208 Rp\u00d7n. Furthermore, we know that there exists an invertible affine mapping A : Rp \u2192 Rp such that after a potential permutation of the columns, A defines a bijection between the columns of X\u2032 and those of X. The problem is to recover the correspondence between the columns of X and the columns of X\u2032, whence the name \u201caffine shuffling inversion\u201d. Note that the columns may be shuffled in an arbitrary way and therefore the matching problem is not trivial. In this setting we can use the affine invariance\nproperty of the Christoffel function described in Theorem 3.5. This is based on the two following observations.\n\u2022 The Christoffel function only depends on the empirical moments and hence is not sensitive to reshufling of the columns.\n\u2022 Working with the affine image amounts to perform a change of basis and a change of origin. By Theorem 3.5, the evaluation of the Christoffel function does not change.\nThis suggests the following procedure.\n\u2022 Compute \u039bX,d and \u039bX\u2032,d the Christoffel functions associated to the columns of X and the columns of X\u2032 respectively.\n\u2022 Set A \u2208 Rn to be the vector which i-th entry is \u039bX,d(Xi) where Xi is the i-th column of X.

In this case, Theorem 3.5 ensures that we have found the correct correspondance. In case of ties, the procedure does not allow to elicit completely the correspondance matching. Overall, the method is not garanteed to work but allows to treat simple cases easily. Investigating the robustness of this procedure to noise or to matching mispecification is the subject of future research.\nAn illustration is given in Figure 3 where a moon shaped cloud of points in R2 is deformed by an affine transformation and the matching between the points between the two clouds is recovered by matching the corresponding Christoffel function values. The correspondance between Christoffel function values is illustrated on a quantile quantile plot."}, {"heading": "5. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we have investigated the potential of the empirical Christoffel function for some applications in statistics and machine learning. This question led us to investigate its theoretical properties as well as potential paths toward applications, mostly in a statistical framework.\nOn the theoretical side, we proposed two main contributions. The first one provides an explicit thresholding scheme which allows to use the Christoffel function to recover the support of a measure with strong asymptotic guarantees. Although this property finds its root in the long history of results regarding asymptotic properties of the Christoffel function, we have provided a systematic way to tune the threshold and the degree to ensure strong convergence guarantees. The second main contribution relates the empirical Christoffel function to its population counterpart in the limit of large samples. This type of results is new and paves the way toward a much more precise understanding of relations between these two objects in a small sample setting.\nOn the practical side, we have illustrated the relevance of the Christoffel function as a practical tool in a machine learning context. In particular, simulations and experiments on real world data support our claim that the empirical Christoffel function is potentially\nuseful for density estimation, support inference and outlier detection. Finally, in another application outside the statistical framework (detection of affine matching between two clouds of points), we have again illustrated the potential of the Christoffel function as a tool in shape recognition and shape comparison.\nBoth theory and applications suggest a broad research program. As already mentioned, an important issue is to quantify the deviation of the empirical Christofel function from its population counterpart in a finite sample setting. Results in this direction could have both theoretical and practical impacts and would to compare more accurately the performance of Christoffel-based approaches with state-of-the art methods. Furthermore, the use of the Christoffel function in a statistical framework raises questions specific to each application considered in this paper and will be the subject of future investigations. Finally, there are still important open questions on the Christoffel function itself and works in the line of Berman (2009) are of great interest to address applications in statistics."}, {"heading": "6.

We argue by contradiction, for the rest of the proof, M denotes a fixed positive number which value can change between expressions. Suppose that (6.11) is false. This means that for each k \u2208 N (up to a subsequence), we can find xk \u2208 S which satisfies\ndist(xk, Sk) \u2265M (6.12)\nSince xk \u2208 S and S is compact, the sequence (xk)k\u2208N has an accumulation point x\u0304 \u2208 S, i.e., (up to a subsequence) xk \u2192 x\u0304 as k \u2192 \u221e.

Since yl \u2208 int(S), we have dist(yl, \u2202S) > 0 for all l. Up to a rearrangment of\nthe terms, we may assume that dist(yl, \u2202S) is decreasing and dist(y0, \u2202S) \u2265 \u03b40. For all l, denote by kl the smallest integer such that dist(yl, \u2202S) \u2265 \u03b4kl . We must have kl \u2192 \u221e and we can discard terms so that kl is a valid subsequence. We have constructed a subsequence kl such that for every l \u2208 N, yl \u2208 Skl and yl \u2192 x\u0304. This is in contradiction with (6.13) and hence (6.11) must be true. The result follows by combining (6.10) and (6.11).\nRemark 6.7 (Refinements) The proof of Theorem 3.8 is based on the following fact{ x \u2208 Rp : dist(x, S\u0304) \u2265 \u03b4k } \u2286 Sk \u2286 {x \u2208 Rp : dist(x, S) \u2264 \u03b4k} .\nDepending on the regularity of the boundary \u2202S of S, it should be possible to get sharper bounds on the distance as a function of \u03b4k. This should involve the dependency in \u03b4 of the function\n\u03b4 \u2192 dH ({ x \u2208 Rp : dist(x, S\u0304) \u2265 \u03b4 } , \u2202S ) .\nFor example, if the boundary \u2202S has bounded curvature, this function is equal to \u03b4 for sufficiently small \u03b4. Another example, if S \u2282 R2 is the interior region of a non self intersecting continuous polygonal loop, then the function is of the order of \u03b4\nsin( \u03b82) , where \u03b8 is the smallest\nangle between two consecutive segments of the loop."}, {"heading": "6.2.4 Proof of Theorem 3.10", "text": "Proof Lemma 6.2 holds with \u00b5 in place of \u00b5S and w\u2212 in place of 1\n\u03bb(S) .

The result follows from (6.15), (6.19) and Theorem 3.1.\n6.3.2 Proof of Theorem 3.11\n. Proof First let us consider measurability issues. Fix n and d such that Md(\u00b5) is invertible. Let X be a matrix in Rp\u00d7n, we use the shorthand notation\n\u039bX,d(z) = min P\u2208Rd[x], P (z)=1\n1\nn n\u2211 i=1 P (Xi) 2, (6.20)\nwhere for each i, Xi is the i-th column of the matrix X. This corresponds to the empirical Christoffel function with input data given by the columns of X. Consider the function F : Rp\u00d7n \u2192 [0, 1] defined as follows:\nF : X\u2192 sup z\u2208Rp |\u039b\u00b5,d(z)\u2212 \u039bX,d(z)| . (6.21)\nIt turns out that F is a semi-algebraic function (its graph is a semi-algebraic set). Roughly speaking a set is semi-algebraic if it can be defined by finitely many polynomial inequalities. We refer the reader to Coste (2000) for an introduction to semi-algebraic geometry, we mostly rely on content from Chapter 2. First, the function\n(X, z, P )\u2192 1 n n\u2211 i=1 P (Xi) 2\nis semi-algebraic (by identifying the space of polynomials with the Euclidean space of their coefficients) and the set {(P, z) : P (z) = 1} is also semi-algebraic. Partial minimization can be expressed by a first order formula, and, by Tarski-Seidenberg Theorem (see e.g. (Coste, 2000, Theorem 2.6)), this operation preserves semi-algebraicity. Hence, the function (X, z) \u2192 \u039bX,d(z) is semi-algebraic. Furthermore, Theorem 3.1 ensures that \u039b\u00b5,d(z) = 1/\u03ba(z, z) for any z, where \u03ba(z, z) is a polynomial in z and hence z \u2192 \u039b\u00b5,d(z) is semi-algebraic. Finally absolute value is semi-algebraic and using a partial minimization argument again, we have that F is a semi-algebraic function.\nAs a semi-algebraic function, F is Borel measurable. Indeed, using the good sets principle (Ash (1972) \u00a71.5.1, p. 35) it is sufficient to prove that, for an arbitrary interval2 (a, b] \u2282 [0, 1], F\u22121((a, b]) \u2208 B(Rp\u00d7n). Any such set is the pre-image of a semi-algebraic set by a semialgebraic map. As proved in (Coste, 2000, Corollary 2.9), any such set must be semialgebraic and hence measurable. Thus, with the notations of Theorem 3.11, \u2016\u039b\u00b5n,d\u2212\u039b\u00b5,d\u2016\u221e is indeed a random variable for each fixed n, d such that Md(\u00b5) is invertible.\nWe now turn to the proof of the main result of the Theorem. For simplicity we adopt the following notation for the rest of the proof. For any continuous function f : Rp \u2192 R, and any subset V \u2286 Rp,\n\u2016f\u2016V := sup x\u2208V |f(x)|, [ so that \u2016f\u2016Rp = \u2016f\u2016\u221e], (6.22)\nwhich could be infinite. We prove that for any > 0,\nP (lim supn {\u2016\u039b\u00b5n,d \u2212 \u039b\u00b5,d\u2016Rp \u2265 }) = 0, (6.23)\nwhere the probability is taken with respect to the random choice of the sequence of independent samples from \u00b5 and the limit supremum is understood setwise with respect to the underlying events.\nFix > 0. Denote by S the compact support of \u00b5. Note that S is also the support of \u00b5n with probability one. From Lemma 6.8, we have an upper bound on both \u039b\u00b5n,d and \u039b\u00b5,d of order O ( dist(x, conv(S))\u22122 ) which holds with probability one. Hence, it is possible to find a compact set V containing S (with complement V c = Rn \\ V ) such that, almost surely,\nmax { \u2016\u039b\u00b5n,d\u2016V c , \u2016\u039b\u00b5,d\u2016V c } \u2264\n2 . (6.24)\nNext, we have the following equivalence \u2016\u039b\u00b5n,d \u2212 \u039b\u00b5,d\u2016Rp \u2265 \u21d4 { \u2016\u039b\u00b5n,d \u2212 \u039b\u00b5,d\u2016V \u2265 or \u2016\u039b\u00b5n,d \u2212 \u039b\u00b5,d\u2016V c \u2265\n(6.25)\nOn the other hand, since both functions are non negative, from equation (6.24), almost surely,\n\u2016\u039b\u00b5n,d \u2212 \u039b\u00b5,d\u2016V c \u2264 max { \u2016\u039b\u00b5n,d\u2016V c , \u2016\u039b\u00b5,d\u2016V c } \u2264\n2 . (6.26)\n2. Recall that the Borel \u03c3-field B([0, 1]) is generated by the intervals (a, b] of [0, 1]; see Ash (1972) \u00a71.4.6, p. 27.\nHence the second event in the right hand side of (6.25) occurs with probability zero. As a consequence, except for a set of events of measure zero, we have\n\u2016\u039b\u00b5n,d \u2212 \u039b\u00b5,d\u2016Rp \u2265 \u21d4 \u2016\u039b\u00b5n,d \u2212 \u039b\u00b5,d\u2016V \u2265 ,\nwhich in turn implies\nP (lim supn {\u2016\u039b\u00b5n,d \u2212 \u039b\u00b5,d\u2016Rp} \u2265 ) = P (lim supn {\u2016\u039b\u00b5n,d \u2212 \u039b\u00b5,d\u2016V } \u2265 ) . (6.27)\nBy assumption the moment matrix Md(\u00b5) is invertible and by the strong law of large numbers, almost surely, Md(\u00b5n) must be invertible for sufficiently large n. Assume that Md(\u00b5n) is invertible, we have\n\u2016\u039b\u00b5n,d \u2212 \u039b\u00b5,d\u2016V = sup x\u2208V {\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 1vd(x)TMd(\u00b5)\u22121vd(x) \u2212 1vd(x)TMd(\u00b5n)\u22121vd(x) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223} (6.28)\n= sup x\u2208V {\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 vd(x)T (Md(\u00b5n)\u22121 \u2212Md(\u00b5)\u22121)vd(x)vd(x)TMd(\u00b5)\u22121vd(x)vd(x)TMd(\u00b5n)\u22121vd(x) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223} .\nUsing the strong law of large numbers again, almost surely, for n sufficiently large, the smallest eigenvalue of Md(\u00b5n) \u22121 is close to that of Md(\u00b5) \u22121 and hence bounded away from zero. Since the first coordinate of vd(x) is 1, the denominator in (6.28) is bounded away from zero almost surely for sufficiently large n. In addition, since V is compact, vd(x) is bounded on V and there exists a constant K such that, almost surely, for sufficiently large n,\n\u2016\u039b\u00b5n,d \u2212 \u039b\u00b5,d\u2016V \u2264 K\u2016Md(\u00b5)\u22121 \u2212Md(\u00b5n)\u22121\u2016, (6.29)\nwhere the matrix-norm in the right hand side is the operator norm induced by the Euclidean norm. Combining (6.27) and (6.29), we obtain\nP (lim supn {\u2016\u039b\u00b5n,d \u2212 \u039b\u00b5,d\u2016Rp} \u2265 ) \u2264 P ( lim supn { K\u2016Md(\u00b5)\u22121 \u2212Md(\u00b5n)\u22121\u2016 \u2265 }) . (6.30)\nThe strong law of large numbers and the continuity of the matrix inverse Md(\u00b7)\u22121 at \u00b5 ensure that the right hand side of (6.30) is 0.

Secondly, we provide a consistency result which relates the empirical Christoffel function and its population counterpart in the limit of large samples.
