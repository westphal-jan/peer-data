INTRODUCTION\nGRAPHS are powerful mathematical models to representcomplex data structures such as networks [1]. Spectral graph theory supports an important class of methods for studying graph topology as well as analyzing graph signals. Graph partitioning problems [2] can be solved as the convex relaxation of the graph-cut criterion, which reverts to an eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian. Thresholding the eigenvector with the smallest non-zero eigenvalue\u2014commonly called the Fiedler vector\u2014leads to a graph bipartition [3]. These eigenvectors also solve the embedding problem; i.e., mapping the nodes onto a line (or higher-dimensional space) such that the distance between connected nodes is minimized [4]. In addition, the same eigenvectors are also used to define the graph Fourier transform (GFT), which has attracted a lot of attention from the signal processing community as many Fourier-domain operations have been generalized to graphs using the GFT [5]. One notable example is the spectral graph wavelet transform [6] that defines graph-domain wavelets by using a window function in the spectral domain.\nIn this Letter, we propose the graph extension of Slepian functions, which were introduced on regular domains by Slepian and colleagues [7], [8] to find a trade-off between temporal and spectral energy concentration. These functions have been extended to several other domains, including spherical ones in the context of geophysics [9].

DEFINING SLEPIAN FUNCTIONS ON GRAPHS", "text": ""}, {"heading": "A. Slepian\u2019s Time-Frequency Concentration Problem", "text": "In seminal work by Slepian, Landau, and Pollak [7], [8], the fundamental problem of optimally concentrating a signal jointly in temporal and spectral domains was solved. Here we will briefly review the 1-D discrete-discrete case, which is directly relevant for the generalization that we will introduce in this work. We define the unitary discrete Fourier transform (DFT) for a length-N signal by the N \u00d7N matrix\nF = 1\u221a N [ej\u03c9l(k\u22121)]k,l, k, l = 1, . . . , N,\nwhere \u03c9l = 2\u03c0(l \u2212 d(N \u2212 1)/2e)/N . Then, the signal represented as a vector f can be Fourier transformed as f\u0302 = FHf , where \u00b7H indicates the Hermitian transpose. Due to Parseval, we have that \u2016f\u20162 = \u2016f\u0302\u20162, where the `2-norm is defined as \u2016f\u20162 = \u3008f , f\u3009 = fHf .\nThe problem at hand is now to optimally concentrate a strictly band-limited signal g in a predefined interval defined by the set of indices S that does not necessarily need to be contiguous. Finding such an optimal signal in terms of energy concentration in S can be formulated as maximizing\n\u00b5 = \u2211 k\u2208S |g[k]|2\u2211N k=1 |g[k]|2 . (1)\nBy definition, the band-limited signal can be represented by a linear combination of a truncated Fourier basis; i.e., we write g = FWg\u0302, where W of size N \u00d7NW selects the first NW Fourier vectors with smallest |\u03c9l|. In addition, we introduce the N \u00d7N diagonal selection matrix S with elements Sk,k = 0/1 that indicate the presence of index k in S; so the number of selected indexes is trace(S) = NS . This allows us now to rewrite Eq. (1) as the Rayleigh quotient\n\u00b5 = g\u0302HCg\u0302\ng\u0302H g\u0302 , (2)\nwhere C = WTFHSFW is the concentration matrix of size NW \u00d7 NW . Finding the optimal solution translates into an eigendecomposition problem, Cs\u0302k = \u00b5ks\u0302k, where \u00b5k represents the energy concentration of the Slepian vector sk = FWs\u0302k in S.\nar X\niv :1\n70 1.\n08 40\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n9 Ja\nn 20\n17\nIt is instructive to illustrate the Slepian vectors with an example. We apply the scheme for a signal of length N = 512. The selected interval is chosen centered at k = 256 with length NS = 129. The bandlimited space contains NW = 17 Fourier basis vectors (|\u03c9l| \u2264 \u03c0/32). In Fig. 1, the first Slepian vector s1 has a Gaussian shape and is well localized in the interval. The second Slepian vector s2 is orthogonal to the first one (both over the original domain and the selected interval as shown above) and still well localized. We then show s5 which has a weaker energy concentration in the interval. By convention, the eigenvalues of the Slepian eigendecomposition are sorted according to decreasing energy concentration 1 > \u00b51 \u2265 \u00b52 \u2265 . . . > 0 in S. The eigenvalue spectrum presents a sudden transition between well-localized and poorly-localized eigenvectors; this phase transition has been well studied and occurs at the time-bandwidth product or Shannon number K = NWNS/N . The inset of Fig. 1 illustrates this phenomenon that happens around K = 4.3 for this example."}, {"heading": "B. Graph Fourier Spectrum", "text": "For an undirected weighted graph with N nodes, the connectivity is characterized by an N \u00d7N symmetric adjacency matrix A, where the elements Ai,j indicate the edge weights between nodes i, j = 1, . . . , N . Here we assume the graph is connected and the edge weights are positive. Next to the graph and its topology, we can also consider graph signals that define a mapping from the nodes to a length-N vector associating a value with every node; e.g., the graph topology can model the presence of communication links between nodes, while the graph signal can represent measures taken at the nodes.\nThe graph Laplacian is defined as L\u2032 = D\u2212A, where D is the diagonal degree matrix with elements Di,i = \u2211N j=1Ai,j . We further consider the normalized graph Laplacian L = D\u22121/2L\u2032D\u22121/2 that factors out differences in degree and thus is only reflecting relative connectivity.\nSpectral methods for graphs are based on the insight that the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian gives access to a GFT. The eigenvectors uk of L minimize\n\u03bb = uTLu\nuTu (3)\nand can be ordered according to increasing eigenvalues \u03bb1 = 0 \u2264 \u03bb2 \u2264 . . . \u2264 \u03bbN . The eigenvectors play the role of basis vectors of the graph spectrum, and the associated eigenvalues of frequencies [12].\nAs an illustration, we build the graph of a mesh structure with 4\u2019567 nodes and 13\u2019650 edges (9\u2019078 faces), see Fig. 2. In Fig. 3, the first 9 Laplacian eigenvectors with smallest eigenvalues are represented. These graph signals correspond to our intuition about low-frequency Fourier basis vectors that represent slow variations along the principle \u201caxes of variation\u201d."}, {"heading": "C. Slepians on Graphs", "text": "To generalize Slepians to graphs, we follow the approach by [11], which is based on introducing selectivity and band-\nwidth. First, selectivity can be easily specified by a subset of nodes S that contains the NS nodes in which we want the energy concentration to be optimal. Similar to the classical 1-D case, we can represent the subgraph by the selection matrix S. Second, for the notion of \u201cbandwidth\u201d, we propose to restrict the spectrum to the eigenvectors with the NW < N smallest eigenvalues \u03bb. We can then consider the truncated graph spectrum matrix UW of size N \u00d7NW ; i.e., any bandlimited graph signal can be represented by g = UWg\u0302.\nSimilar to the 1-D case outlined before, finding the linear combination of eigenvectors within the bandlimit NW and with maximal energy in S reverts to optimizing the Rayleigh quotient\n\u00b5 = g\u0302TCg\u0302\ng\u0302T g\u0302 , (4)\nwhere C = WTUTSUW is the concentration matrix. Since L is real and symmetric, U is real as well and we revert to the regular transpose \u00b7T .\nWe reuse1 the mesh example to demonstrate the Slepian design in Fig. 4a. We selected a subgraph that corresponds to the head of the animal (i.e., 1\u2019534 nodes), see Fig. 2. The bandwidth ratio NW /N is a design choice, which we choose here as 9/4\u2032567 = 0.2% to build upon the previously shown part of the Laplacian spectrum. We ordered the Slepian vectors according to increasing eigenvalues. The vector #9 with highest eigenvalue (0.995) has a strong positive signal in the lower part of the head, in particular, the snout region. The second most-concentrated Slepian #8 highlights left-versusright contrast in the head, while the third one has strong signal in the upper part of the head. Then the energy concentration drops sharply and the following Slepian vectors have almost no more signal in the head."}, {"heading": "III. LINK WITH LAPLACIAN EMBEDDING AND GRAPH CLUSTERING", "text": "The GFT plays a central role in Laplacian embedding and graph clustering. Specifically, in Laplacian embedding, the aim is to find a mapping from the nodes onto a line such that strongly connected nodes stay as close as possible, which can be expressed as [4]:\nargmin g N\u2211 i,j=1 Ai,j(gi \u2212 gj)2 = argmin g gTLg, (5)\nwhere gTg = 1 and gT1 = 0. The solution is the eigenvector of the Laplacian with the smallest non-zero eigenvalue, the Fiedler vector [3]. The optimization (5) is also related to the classical graph cut problem that consists of partitioning the graph into clusters of nodes such that the cut size is minimal. In this setting, gi = \u00b11 indicate the labels of the nodes, which can be relaxed to take any real values. For instance, in Fig. 3, the Fiedler vector is #2, which means that 1-D Laplacian embedding projects nodes according to the posterior-anterior\n1It is interesting to note that the classical 1-D case of Subsec. II-A can be implemented using the chain graph where every node is connected to its two neighbors, which corresponds to a circulant adjacency matrix. The GFT then becomes equivalent to the DFT.\naxis. An optimal graph cut would separate the front and the back of the animal.\nWe now use the Slepian design to generalize the criterion (5) as to find a bandlimited solution that is optimized for a selected set of nodes. To reveal this link, we first rewrite the quadratic form (5) as\ngTLg = gTU\u039bUTg = g\u0302T\u039bg\u0302. (6)\nBy observing the identity \u039b = \u039b1/2UTU\u039b1/2, we propose to generalize the criterion by introducing the bandwidth selection in the spectral, and node selection in the graph domain, respectively:\n\u03be = g\u0302T\u039b1/2 WTUTSUW\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 C \u039b1/2g\u0302, (7)\nwhich boils down to solving the eigendecomposition of the modified concentration matrix\nCemb = \u039b 1/2C\u039b1/2. (8)\nThis demonstrates that Laplacian embedding can be generalized as a Slepian problem with the additional weighting of the Laplacian eigenvalues. It is interesting to note that the eigenvalues \u03be of Cemb represent the modified embedded distance, or, equivalently, a \u201cfrequency\u201d that is localized in the subgraph S , whereas the eigenvalues \u00b5 of C represent the energy concentration in the subgraph.\nIn Fig. 4b, we show the solution for the modified Slepian design. In addition, we also compute for each vector the Laplacian embedded distance and energy concentration according to Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively. For comparison, we also include this information in Figs. 3 and 4a, where the values that are true eigenvalues are typeset in bold.\nThe eigenvector #1 is the trivial (constant) solution, followed by a number of eigenvectors that have very low modified embedded distance since they are not well localized in the subgraph. The eigenvectors #8 and #9 have the highest modified embedded distance and highest energy concentration, but they appear in different order as compared to the first design (Fig. 4a), since these criteria drive for a different ranking. It is also interesting to notice that the sharp transition in energy concentration between #6 and #7 for the first design, is much less pronounced for the second design, but both vectors have a lower modified embedded distance (which was optimized). Finally, the Laplacian eigenvector #9 (Fig. 3) had already a high energy concentration in the subgraph to start with, and it is reused in both Slepian designs as #8 and #9, respectively.\nFinally, we note that for both designs the Slepian vectors are orthonormal over the entire graph as well as orthogonal over the interval S; i.e., it can be readily shown that gTk gl = \u03b4k\u2212l as well as gTk Sgl = \u00b5k\u03b4k\u2212l and g T k Sgl = \u03bek\u03b4k\u2212l for the first and second design, respectively, where \u03b4 is the Kronecker delta."}, {"heading": "IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION", "text": "We proposed two designs to obtain Slepian graph signals that are parametrized by the subgraph selection and the bandwidth. The latter provides a handle on the amount of \u201cglobal\u201d information that can be used to optimize energy concentration or embedded distance in the subgraph. Interestingly,\nwhen NW approaches N and without subgraph selection, the concentration matrix of the first design becomes identity, while for the second one it becomes equivalent to the conventional Laplacian.\nIn practice, for large graphs, we want to apply the design to a limited number of eigenvectors NW that can be obtained using efficient large-scale solvers [13] implemented in widely available software libraries such as ARPACK. The Slepian optimization itself is a low-dimensional eigendecomposition of a matrix of size NW \u00d7NW .\nFuture extensions of the Slepian design can also strike a balance between energy concentration and modified embedded distance, for instance, by considering the blended concentration matrix\nC\u03b1 = (1\u2212 \u03b1)C + \u03b1Cemb, for 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1. (9)\nFinally, the proposed Slepian designs can serve further methodological developments in this active field, such as being adapted for spectral definitions of directed graphs [14], selective filtering or interpolation of graph signals [5], [15], or to generalize multi-resolution approaches [6], [16], [17]. The flexibility of the method, to easily recompute the Slepian vectors for different choices of the subgraph, can also enable gradual refinements and thus extend existing approaches to discover hierarchical graph structure; e.g., [18], [19]."}], "references": [{"title": "Networks: An Introduction", "author": ["M.

complex systems in many scientific disciplines. Graph signal processing is receiving growing interest as to design novel tools to combine the analysis of topology and signals. The graph Fourier transform, defined as the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian, allows extending conventional signal-processing operations to graphs. One main feature is to let emerge global organization from local interactions; i.e., the Fiedler vector has the smallest non-zero eigenvalue and is key for Laplacian embedding and graph clustering. Here, we introduce the design of Slepian graph signals, by maximizing energy concentration in a predefined subgraph for a given spectral bandlimit. We also establish a link with classical Laplacian embedding and graph clustering, for which the graph Slepian design can serve as a generalization.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
