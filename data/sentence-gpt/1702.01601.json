As a result, there is no direct connection between these abstract concepts and the concrete environment in which the agents\u2019 interact. This kind of grounding problem of logics for MAS becomes particularly relevant for robotic applications. Since robots are situated in spatial environments, in order to make logics for MAS useful for robotics, their semantics have to be grounded on space. Specifically, a formal semantics is required that provides an explicit representation of the space in which the robots\u2019 actions and perceptions are situated. Some initial steps into the direction of grounding formal semantics of logics for MAS on space have done in the recent years. Among them, we should mention logics of multi-agent knowledge in both one-dimensional space and two-dimensional space [9, 3], spatio-temporal logics such as constraint LTL applied to model 2D grid environments [2], multi-\nrobot task logic based on monadic second-order logic [14] and logics of robot localization [4]. The present paper shares with these approaches the idea that in order to make existing logics of MAS useful for MAS applications such as multi-agent planning and robotics, their semantics should provide an explicit representation of the agents\u2019 environment.\nThe main motivation of the present work is to provide a logical framework whose language and semantics are, at the same time, simple and sufficiently general to describe (i) the properties of the spatial environment in which several agents can move, and (ii) the consequences of the agents\u2019 motion on such a spatial environment. To meet this objective, we have decided to exploit the language of propositional dynamic logic PDL as a general formalism for representing actions of agents and their effects, and to interpret this language on a simple formal semantics of the two-dimensional (2D) space. The reason why we decided to start from the 2D space is that its representation already presents some interesting conceptual aspects as well as some difficulties with respect to the computational properties of the resulting logic. We believe that, before studying action in the 3D space and, more generally, action in n-dimensional spaces (with n > 2), a comprehensive logical theory of action in the 2D space is required.\nMore concretely, this paper presents a family of logics for reasoning about agents\u2019 positions and motion in the plane. The most general logic, called Dynamic Logic of Space DL-S\u2217, is presented in Section 2. DL-S\u2217 includes (i) atomic formulas for representing the truth of a given fact (atomic facts) or the presence of a given agent at a certain position of the plane (positional atoms), (ii) atomic programs corresponding to the four basic orientations in the plane (up, down, left, right) as well as the four program constructs of PDL (sequential composition, nondeterministic composition, iteration and test). The logic is proved to be non-computably enumerable (non-c.e.) and its satisfiability problem undecidable (Section 3), while its model-checking problem is proved to be decidable in deterministic polynomial time (Section 4). Given the negative properties of DL-S\u2217, we decided to study some interesting decidable and axiomatizable fragments of it. This includes the iteration-free fragment of DL-S\u2217 (Section 5) as well as a fragment that only allows iteration of the same atomic program (e.g., the action of moving an indefinite number of times to the right) and has no atomic formulas aside from positional atoms (Section 6). As the logic DL-S\u2217 only provides a static representation of the 2D space, in Section 7 we present a decidable extension of its iteration-free fragment by special programs representing motion of agents in the plane. Conclusion of the paper (Section 8) presents perspectives of future research including integration of an epistemic component in the logic as well as of the concept of coalitional capability in the sense of [12]."}, {"heading": "2 Space", "text": "DL-S\u2217 (Dynamic Logic of Space) is a dynamic logic which consists of: (i) formulas representing the agents\u2019 positions and the truth of facts in the different\npositions of the bidimensional space, and (ii) programs allowing to move from one position to another position of the bidimensional space."}, {"heading": "2.1 Syntax", "text": "Assume a countable set of atomic propositions Atm = {p, q, . . .} and a finite set of agents Agt = {1, . . . , n}.\nThe language of DL-S\u2217, denoted by LDL-S\u2217(Atm,Agt), is defined by the following grammar in Backus-Naur Form:\n\u03b1 ::= \u21d1 | \u21d3 | \u21d2 | \u21d0 | \u03b1;\u03b1\u2032 | \u03b1 \u222a \u03b1\u2032 | \u03b1\u2217 |?\u03d5 \u03d5 ::= p | hi | \u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8 | [\u03b1]\u03d5\nwhere p ranges over Atm and i ranges over Agt .

Products of linear logics are logics with two (or more) modalities, interpreted over structures very similar to spatial models. Their formulas are equivalent to LDL-S\u2217(Atm,Agt)-formulas over the class of all spatial models and are often undecidable [8, 10, 13]. This suggests that the satisfiability problem of formulas in LDL-S\u2217(Atm,Agt), as well as some proper fragments, is undecidable as well. The idea is to allow actions only along the horizontal and vertical axes, which following [11] we call the \u2018compass directions\u2019. To be precise, we define the language of compass logic of space by LCL-S\u2217(Atm,Agt) = LDL-S\u2217(Atm,Agt , C), where\nC = {\u21d1,\u21d3,\u21d2,\u21d0,\u21d1\u2217,\u21d3\u2217,\u21d2\u2217,\u21d0\u2217}.\nAs before, we may omit the parameters Atm,Agt when this does not lead to confusion. By LCL-F\u2217 (the language of compass logic of facts) we denote the special case where Agt = \u2205, and similarly LCL-P\u2217 (the language of compass logic of positions) denotes the case where Atm = \u2205.\nWe start with the following undecidability result for the satisfiability problem of the latter.\nTheorem 1. The set of valid formulas of LCL-F\u2217 is not computably enumerable.\nProof. This follows from Theorem 5.38 in [8], which states (in their notation) that PTL \u25e6 \u00d7 PTL \u25e6 is not c.e. But this is a notational variant of a fragment of CL-F\u2217, where \u25e61 \u2248 [\u21d2], 1 \u2248 [\u21d2 \u2217], \u25e62 \u2248 [\u21d1], and 2 \u2248 [\u21d1 \u2217].\nWe remark that we only need two of the four compass directions for this proof, provided they are perpendicular. As a corollary, we obtain undecidability of the larger logic.\nCorollary 1. The set of valid formulas of LDL-S\u2217 is not computably enumerable.\nIn order to study model-checking, we need a finite representation of spatial models. To this aim, we introduce the following definition of bounded spatial model of size n. For (x, y) \u2208 Z2, write |(x, y)| \u2264 n iff |x| \u2264 n and |y| \u2264 n.\nDefinition 4 (Bounded spatial model (BSM)). Let n be a nonnegative integer. A spatial model M = (P ,V) is said to be n-bounded iff for all i \u2208 Agt, |P(i)| \u2264 n and for all (x, y) \u2208 Z2 \u00d7 Z2, if |(x, y)| 6\u2264 n then V(x, y) = \u2205.\nObserve that while the interpretations of variables are bounded, the frame itself is not; we still interpret formulas over Z\u00d7 Z.\nAs for the class of all models, the restriction to bounded models gives rise to an undecidable set of valid formulas of LDL-S\u2217 -formulas:\nTheorem 2. The set of formulas of LCL-F\u2217 valid over the class of bounded spatial models is not computably enumerable.\nSketch of Proof. This essentially follows from Corollary 7.18 in [8], which in their notation states that Log{\u3008N,\u2265\u3009 \u00d7 N,\u2265\u3009} is not c.e. As above, this is a notational variant of a fragment of CL-F\u2217, where 1 \u2248 [\u21d2\u2217] and 2 \u2248 [\u21d1\n\u2217], although interpreted over frames of the form {0, . . . n} \u00d7 {0, . . . ,m}. That it is not c.e. is obtained by reducing the halting problem for Turing machines to Log{\u3008N,\u2265\u3009 \u00d7 N,\u2265\u3009}, representing finite computations as finite models. Minor adjustments of this construction can be used, instead, to represent finite computations as bounded models.\nAs before, the undecidability of the set of formulas of LDL-S\u2217 valid over the class of bounded spatial models follows. There are different ways to get out of the undecidability of the satisfiability problem of LDL-S\u2217 -formulas as highlighted by Corollary 1. One possibility is to consider the star-free fragment of LDL-S\u2217 . Another possibility is to study fragments of LDL-S\u2217 that omit atomic propositions and allow only nominals. These two possibilities are explored, respectively, in Sections 5 and 6."}, {"heading": "4 Model-checking", "text": "The model-checking problem for LCL-S\u2217(Atm,Agt) is the following: let \u03d5 \u2208 LCL-S\u2217(Atm,Agt), let n be a nonnegative integer, let M be an n-bounded spatial model and let (x, y) \u2208 Z\u00d7 Z, is it the case that M, (x, y) |= \u03d5?\nIn this section we will show that the model-checking problem for LCL-S\u2217(Atm,Agt) is in PTime.

Note that LDL-S(Atm,Agt) can be reduced to L0 DL-S (Atm,Agt):\nLemma 4. Every formula \u03d5 \u2208 LDL-S(Atm,Agt) is equivalent to some \u03d50 \u2208 L0 DL-S (Atm,Agt).\nProof. It suffices to observe that the following are valid:\n[\u03b1;\u03b1\u2032]\u03c8 \u2194 [\u03b1][\u03b1\u2032]\u03c8\n[\u03b1 \u222a \u03b1\u2032]\u03c8 \u2194 [\u03b1]\u03c8 \u2227 [\u03b1\u2032]\u03c8\n[?\u03b8]\u03c8 \u2194 (\u03b8 \u2192 \u03c8).\nWith these validities, any formula of LDL-S(Atm,Agt) can be recursively reduced to an equivalent formula in the language L0\nDL-S (Atm,Agt).\nOur decidability proof will be based on a small model property, obtained by truncating a larger model. Fix a natural number n. Given a model M = (P ,V), we define M \u21be n = (P \u21be n,V \u21be n).\n\u2022 (P \u21be n)(i) =\n{\nP(i) if |P(i)| \u2264 n;\n(n+ 1, 0) otherwise.\n\u2022 (V \u21be n)(p) = V(p) \u2229 ( [\u2212n, n]\u00d7 [\u2212n, n] ) .\nObserve that M \u21be n is (n + 1)-bounded. As a result, when one restricts the discussion to the set of all programs of L0\nDL-S (Atm,Agt),\nLemma 5. For all ~x \u2208 Z2 \u00d7Z2, if |~x| \u2264 m \u2264 n, then (M,~x) -n\u2212m (M \u21be n, ~x).\nProof. The proof proceeds by a standard induction on m. The atoms and position clauses are trivial since x \u2264 n and the values of atomic propositions is not changed. For the inductive case, consider (for example) \u03b1 = \u21d2. Then, if ~x = (x0, x1), ~xR\u21d2~y if and only if ~y = (x0 + 1, x1). Clearly |~y| \u2264 m+ 1, so that by the induction hypothesis, (M,~x) -n\u2212m\u22121 (M \u21be n, ~y), as needed.\nWith this we obtain our first decidability result.\nTheorem 4. The logics DL-S0,DL-S are decidable. In particular, DL-S0 is in NP.\nProof. Since DL-S can be reduced to DL-S0, it suffices to show that the latter is decidable. Suppose that \u03d5 is satisfied on some model M ; without loss of generality, we can assume that \u03d5 is satisfied on the origin. Let n be the modal degree of \u03d5. By Lemma 5, (M,~0) -n (M \u21be n,~0), so by Lemma 1, \u03d5 is also satisfied on (M \u21be n,~0). It follows that \u03d5 is satisfiable if and only if it is satisfiable on the class of models such that P and V are both (n+1)-bounded, so it remains to enumerate all such models and check whether any of them satisfy \u03d5. Note that the size of any (n + 1)-bounded model is o(n2), so the complexity bound for DL-S0 follows.\nObserve that it does not follow from our techniques that DL-S is in NP, since the reduction procedure is not polynomial.\nNow, our aim in this section will be to completely axiomatize DL-S0. In this respect, we need the following axioms and inference rules:\n\u2022 All axioms and inference rules saying that [\u21d1], [\u21d3], [\u21d2] and [\u21d0] are normal modalities,\n\u2022 [\u03b1]\u03d5 \u2194 \u3008\u03b1\u3009\u03d5 for each \u03b1 \u2208 {\u21d1,\u21d3,\u21d2,\u21d0},\n\u2022 \u03d5 \u2192 [\u21d1]\u3008\u21d3\u3009\u03d5 and \u03d5 \u2192 [\u21d3]\u3008\u21d1\u3009\u03d5,\n\u2022 \u03d5 \u2192 [\u21d2]\u3008\u21d0\u3009\u03d5 and \u03d5 \u2192 [\u21d0]\u3008\u21d2\u3009\u03d5,\n\u2022 [\u03b11][\u03b12]\u03d5 \u2194 [\u03b12][\u03b11]\u03d5 for each \u03b11, \u03b12 \u2208 {\u21d1,\u21d3,\u21d2,\u21d0},\n\u2022 hi \u2192 [\u21d1]x[\u21d2]y\u00achi for each nonnegative integers x, y such that x 6= 0 or y 6= 0.\nWe will say that a formula \u03d5 \u2208 L0 DL-S\n(Atm,Agt) is derivable if it belongs to the least set of L0\nDL-S (Atm,Agt)-formulas containing the above axioms and closed\nunder the above inference rules.\nTheorem 5. let \u03d5 be an L0 DL-S\n(Atm,Agt)-formula. The following conditions are equivalent: (i) \u03d5 is derivable; (ii) \u03d5 is valid.\nProof. (i)\u21d2(ii): It suffices to check that all axioms are valid and that all inference rules preserve valitity. (ii)\u21d2(i): Suppose \u03d5 is not derivable. Let d denote the modal degree of \u03d5. By Lindenbaum\u2019s Lemma, let \u0393 be a maximal consistent set of formulas such that \u03d5 6\u2208 \u0393. Remark that for all i \u2208 Agt, if hi 6\u2208 \u0393 then there exists at most one pair (x, y) of (negative or positive) integers such that [\u21d1]x[\u21d2]yhi \u2208 \u0393. Let Agt(\u0393) be the set of all i \u2208 Agt such that [\u21d1]x[\u21d2]yhi \u2208 \u0393 for some pair (x, y) of integers such that |(x, y)| \u2264 d. Let M = (P ,V) be the spatial model defined as follows:\n\u2022 For all i \u2208 Agt, if i \u2208 Agt(\u0393) then let P(i) be the unique pair (x, y) of integers such that [\u21d1]x[\u21d2]yhi \u2208 \u0393, else let P(i) be (d+ 1, 0),\n\u2022 for all pairs (x, y) of integers, if |(x, y)| \u2264 d then let V(x, y) = {p \u2208 Atm : [\u21d2]x[\u21d1]yp \u2208 \u0393}, else let V(x, y) = \u2205.\nThe reader may easily prove by induction on \u03c8 that if \u03c8 is a subformula of \u03d5 then for all pairs (x, y) such that |(x, y)| \u2264 deg(\u03d5) \u2212 deg(\u03c8), M, (x, y) |= \u03c8 iff [\u21d2]x[\u21d1]y\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393. Since \u03d5 6\u2208 \u0393, therefore M, (0, 0) 6|= \u03d5. Thus, \u03d5 is not valid."}, {"heading": "6 Compass logic of positions", "text": "Next we consider the fragment LCL-P\u2217 , defined in Section 3. Since there are no atomic propositions, models are somewhat simpler.\nDefinition 5. A position model is a function P : Agt \u2192 Z\u00d7 Z.\nThat is, a position model is just a spatial model without a valuation for atomic propositions. As we will show, position models do not need to have big \u2018gaps\u2019 if we only care about satisfiability of LCL-P\u2217 -formulas. This will give us a small model property.\nDefinition 6. Let P be a position model. A vertical gap is a set G = [a, b]\u00d7Z such that for all i \u2208 Agt, P(i) 6\u2208 G. If (x, y) \u2208 G, we say that the depth of (x, y) in G is min(x \u2212 a, b \u2212 x), and Gm denotes the set of elements of depth at least m; observe that G0 = G, and Gm is also a gap when non-empty. The\nremoval of G is the function \u03c1 given by \u03c1(x, y) = (x\u2032, y) where x\u2032 = x if x \u2264 a, x\u2032 = min(a, x\u2212 (b\u2212 a)) otherwise.\nA horizontal gap is defined analogously, but is of the form Z \u00d7 [a, b]. The depth and the removal are defined analogously as well.\nIn this section we use -n for n-bisimilarity with respect to all basic relations of LCL-P\u2217 .\nLemma 6. Let G = [a, b] \u00d7 Z be a vertical gap and P be a position model. Then, if (x, y), (x\u2032, y) \u2208 Gm, it follows that P , (x, y) -m P , (x\u2032, y).\nThe analogous claim holds for horizontal gaps.\nProof. We proceed by induction on m. The atomic clauses are straightforward since, if (x, y), (x\u2032, y) \u2208 G0 = G, then they satisfy no atoms.\nFor the other clauses, assume the claim inductively for m, and suppose that (x, y), (x\u2032, y) \u2208 Gm+1. Any \u2018vertical\u2019 program (\u21d1,\u21d3,\u21d1\n\u2217,\u21d3\u2217) stays within Gm+1 \u2286 Gm so we may immediately apply the induction hypothesis. For example, if (u, v)R\u21d1\u2217(x, y), then u = x and v \u2265 y; hence, (x\u2032, y)R\u21d1\u2217(x\u2032, v) and by the induction hypothesis, (u, v) = (x, v) -m (x\n\u2032, v). The \u2018back\u2019 clauses and the rest of the vertical programs are entirely symmetrical.\nNext consider a \u2018horizontal\u2019 program: \u21d0,\u21d2,\u21d0\u2217,\u21d2\u2217. By symmetry, we will only consider the \u2018forth\u2019 clauses of the \u2018right\u2019 programs. We have that R\u21d2 is a function; specifically, R\u21d2(x, y) = (x + 1, y). Observe that (x + 1, y) \u2208 Gm, and similarly (x\u2032 + 1, y) \u2208 Gm. But, by the induction hypothesis, (x+ 1, y) -m (x\u2032 + 1, y) = R\u21d2(x\n\u2032, y), as needed. Now suppose that (x, y)R\u21d2\u2217(u, v), so that u \u2265 x and v = y. We consider two cases. If also u \u2265 x\u2032, then we also have that (x\u2032, y)R\u21d2\u2217(u, v), and we may use the same witness. Otherwise, x \u2264 u < x\u2032, which means that (u, v) \u2208 Gm+1 \u2286 Gm, so by the induction hypothesis (x, v) -m (x \u2032, y). But also, (x\u2032, y)R\u21d2\u2217(x \u2032, y), and we can use it as our witness. As mentioned, the other clauses are entirely symmetrical and left to the reader. By induction onm, the claim follows. The analogous claim for horizontal gaps is also entirely analogous.\nLemma 7. Let G = [a\u2212m, b +m]\u00d7 Z be a vertical gap and \u03c1 the removal of Gm. Then, P , ~x -m \u03c1P , \u03c1(~x).\nProof. We prove, by induction on k \u2264 m, that P , ~x -k \u03c1P , \u03c1(~x). For k = 0 this is clear, since if (x, y) \u2208 Gm, no nominal occurs on (x, y) or on \u03c1(x, y) = (a, y). Otherwise, (x, y) = P(i) if and only if \u03c1(x, y) = \u03c1P(i).\nNow, assume the claim for k, and let \u03c1(x, y) = (x\u2032, y). The \u2018forth\u2019 clauses for \u03b1 \u2208 {R\u21d1, R\u21d3, R\u2217\u21d1, R \u2217 \u21d3} follow by observing that if (x, y)R\u03b1(u, v), then \u03c1(x, y)R\u03b1\u03c1(u, v); for example, if \u03b1 = \u21d3, then we must have u = x and v = y\u2212 1, and since \u03c1 fixes the y coordinate we have that if \u03c1(x, y) = (x\u2032, y), then \u03c1(u, v) = (x\u2032, y \u2212 1), as needed. Similarly, for the \u2018back\u2019 clause, if \u03c1(x, y) = (x\u2032, y) and (x\u2032, y)R\u03b1(u, v), we must have u = x\u2032 and can readily observe that (x, y)R\u03b1(x, v) and \u03c1(x, v) = (x\u2032, v), so that by the induction hypothesis, P , (x, v) -k \u03c1P , \u03c1(x \u2032, v).\nNext we look at \u03b1 \u2208 {\u21d0,\u21d2,\u21d0\u2217,\u21d2\u2217}. First, we check the \u2018forth\u2019 clauses. If (x, y)R\u21d0(u, v), then u = x\u22121 and v = y. If x 6\u2208 (a, b], then it readily follows that \u03c1(x, y)R\u21d0\u03c1(u, v), and we may use the induction hypothesis. If instead x \u2208 (a, b], then \u03c1(u, v) = \u03c1(x, y) = (a, y). However, R\u21d0(a, y) = (a \u2212 1, y) \u2208 Gm\u22121, so by the induction hypothesis and Lemma 6,\n\u03c1P , (a\u2212 1, y) -k P , (a\u2212 1, y) -k P , (x\u2212 1, y),\nas needed. For \u03b1 = \u21d0\u2217, suppose (x, y)R\u21d0\u2217(u, v). Then, y = v, and since \u03c1 is non-decreasing on the first component, we also have \u03c1(x, y)R\u21d0\u2217\u03c1(u, v). The cases for the \u2018right\u2019 programs are similar.\nFinally, we check the \u2018back\u2019 clauses for the horizontal programs. Observe that R\u21d0, R\u21d2 are functional, so the \u2018forth\u2019 and \u2018back\u2019 clauses are equivalent. Hence we consider only R\u21d0\u2217 , R\u21d2\u2217 . If (x\n\u2032, y)R\u21d0\u2217(u, y), then consider two cases. If u \u2264 a, then \u03c1(u, y) = (u, y) and u \u2264 x\u2032 \u2264 x, so we have that (x, y)R\u21d0\u2217(u, y) and we may use the induction hypothesis on (u, y). If u > a, then \u03c1(u+b\u2212a, y) = (u, y), and we may use the induction hypothesis on (u+b\u2212a, y). But note that, in this case, we must have that x = x\u2032 + b\u2212 a, so (x, y)R\u21d0\u2217(u+ b \u2212 a, y).\nFinally, if (x\u2032, y)R\u21d2\u2217(u, y), again consider two cases. If u < a, then \u03c1(u, y) = (u, y) and u \u2265 x\u2032 = x, so we have that (x, y)R\u21d2\u2217(u, y) and we may use the induction hypothesis on (u, y). If u \u2265 a, then \u03c1(u + b \u2212 a, y) = (u, y), and we may use the induction hypothesis on (u + b \u2212 a, y). Note that, in this case, x \u2264 x\u2032 + b\u2212 a \u2264 u+ b\u2212 a, so (x, y)R\u21d2\u2217(u, y), as needed.\nThe case for a horizontal gap is similar.\nTheorem 6. If \u03d5 \u2208 LCL-P\u2217 is satisfiable, it is satisfiable on a position model where all coordinates of positions are bounded by 2(|\u03d5|+ 1)2.\nProof. Assume that \u03d5 is satisfied on some position model P . Suppose that x1 \u2264 . . . \u2264 xn are the x-coordinates of all positions of agents such that hi appears in \u03d5, together with the evaluation point, (0, 0) (note that n \u2264 |\u03d5|+ 1). If for some i < n we have that xi+1 \u2212 xi > 2(|\u03d5| + 1), then G = (xi, xi+1) \u00d7 Z is a horizontal strip with G|\u03d5| having width at least two, so that its removal is not the identity.\nNow, if the xi\u2019s are not bounded by 2(|\u03d5|+ 1)2, note that such a gap must exist so we can remove it. After enough iterations, we can bound all xi\u2019s. Then we proceed to bound the vertical components analogously.\nTheorem 7. Satisfiability of LCL-P\u2217-formulas is decidable in NP.\nProof. We can decide the satisfiability of \u03d5 by guessing a position model P with all coordinates bounded by 2(|\u03d5|+ 1)2 and model-checking whether \u03d5 holds at (0, 0)."}, {"heading": "7 Space and motion", "text": "DL-S studied in the previous sections is a logic for representing static properties of the bidimensional space.

The logic DL-SM is completely axiomatized by the axioms and rules of inference of the star-free fragment of DL-SM given in Section 5, the valid formulas of Proposition 1 and the rule of replacement of equivalents."}, {"heading": "8 Perspectives", "text": "Beforewe discuss two perspectives for the extension of the logic DL-S\u2217 and DL-SM by concepts of perceptual knowledge and coalitional capability.\nPerceptual knowledge DL-S\u2217 and DL-SM support reasoning about properties of the 2D space as well as about positions and motion of agents in the 2D space. However, an agent in the space does not only move but also sees where other agents are, how the space around her is, what other agents do, etc. More generally, agents in the space have perceptual knowledge (i.e., knowledge based on what they see). We want to propose here a simple extension of DL-S\u2217 and DL-SM by modal operators of perceptual knowledge. Specifically, we consider epistemic-like operators of type Ski describing what an agent could see from her current position, if she had a range of vision of size k \u2208 N. An agent\u2019s range of vision of size k corresponds to the square centered at the agent\u2019s position with side length equal to 2\u00d7 k. We call the latter agent i\u2019s neighborhood of size k.\nIn order to provide an interpretation of the operator Ski , the following concept of indistinguishibility is required. Let i \u2208 Agt and let M = (P ,V) and M \u2032 = (P \u2032,V \u2032) be two spatial models. We say that M and M \u2032 are indistinguishable for agent i given her current position and her range of vision of size k, denoted by M \u223cki M \u2032, if and only if:\nV \u2032(x, y) = V(x, y) P \u2032(j) = P(j)\nfor all (x, y) \u2208 Z \u00d7 Z and for all j \u2208 Agt such that (x, y) \u2208 D(i, k) and P(j) \u2208 D(i, k) with\nD(i, k) ={(x\u2032, y\u2032) : Px(j)\u2212 k \u2264 x \u2032 \u2264 Px(j) + k and\nPy(j)\u2212 k \u2264 y \u2032 \u2264 Py(j) + k}\nwhere Px(j) and Py(j) are, respectively, the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate in P(j).\nThis notion of indistinguishibility is essential to provide a truth condition of the formula Ski \u03d5 that has to be read \u201cif agent i had a range of vision of size k, then i could see that \u03d5 is true from her current position\u201d. Let M be a spatial model and let (x, y) \u2208 Z\u00d7 Z. Then:\nM, (x, y) |= Ski \u03d5 \u21d0\u21d2 \u2200M \u2032 \u2208 M : if M \u223cki M \u2032\nthen M \u2032,P(i) |= \u03d5\nIt is easy to check that \u223cki is an equivalence relation. Thus, the operator S k i satisfies all S5 principles.Ski satisfies additional principles that are proper to its spatial interpretation. For instance, let\nPrg(k) ={\u21d0h\u21d1h : 0 \u2264 h \u2264 k} \u222a {\u21d2h\u21d1h : 0 \u2264 h \u2264 k}\u222a\n{\u21d0h\u21d3h : 0 \u2264 h \u2264 k} \u222a {\u21d2h\u21d3h : 0 \u2264 h \u2264 k}\nbe the set of spatial programs that allow to reach all and only those points in an agent\u2019s neighborhood of size k. Then, under the previous interpretation of the operator Ski , the following formulas become valid for every \u03b1 \u2208 Prg(k):\nhi \u2192 ([\u03b1]p \u2194 S k i [\u03b1]p) (12) hi \u2192 ([\u03b1]hj \u2194 S k i [\u03b1]hj) (13)\nThis means that if an agent i has a range of vision of size k, then she can perceive all facts that are true and all agents that are positioned in her neighborhood of size k. The following formula is an example of instance of the previous validity:\nhi \u2192 ([\u21d1]hj \u2194 S 1 i [\u21d1]hj) (14)\nThe latter means that if agent i has a range of vision of size 1 then, agent j is above her iff agent i perceives this.\nWe postpone to future work a study of the complexities of model-checking and of decidability for the extensions by epistemic operators Ski of the different logics presented in the paper.\nCoalitional capability DL-SM provides an interesting basis for the development of a logic of coalitional capabilities in the two-dimensional space. We take the concept of \u2018coalitional capability\u2019 in the sense of Coalition Logic CL [12]. Specifically, we say that coalition C has the capability of ensuring \u03d5, denoted by \u3008[C]\u3009\u03d5, if and only if \u201cthere exists a joint action \u03b4C of coalition C such that, by performing it, outcome \u03d5 will be ensured, no matter what the agents outside C decide to do\u201d. The extension of DL-SM by coalitional capability operators \u3008[C]\u3009 is rather simple, as the agents\u2019 action repertoires only includes the four basic movements in the plane (\u21d1i,\u21d3i,\u21d0i and \u21d2i) and the action of doing nothing (nil i).\nFollowing Section 7, for every coalition C \u2286 Agt we define its set of joint of actions \u2206C = \u220f i\u2208C Act i and denote elements of \u2206C by \u03b4C , \u03b4 \u2032 C , . . . Then, the truth condition of the operator \u3008[C]\u3009 goes as follows: M, (x, y) |= \u3008[C]\u3009\u03d5 if and only if \u2203\u03b4C \u2208 \u2206C such that\n\u2200\u03b4\u2032Agt\\C \u2208 \u2206Agt\\C : M, (x, y) |= [\u03b4C , \u03b4 \u2032 Agt\\C ]\u03d5.\nSince \u03b4C and \u03b4 \u2032 Agt\\C are finite, \u3008[C]\u3009\u03d5 is expressible in DL-SM but at the price of an exponential blowup in the size of the formula \u03d5. It is easy to check that the operator \u3008[C]\u3009 satisfies the following basic princi-\nples of the coalitional capability operator by [12]:\n\u00ac\u3008[C]\u3009\u22a5 (15)\n\u3008[C]\u3009\u22a4 (16)\n\u00ac\u3008[\u2205]\u3009\u00ac\u03d5 \u2192 \u3008[Agt ]\u3009\u03d5 (17)\n\u3008[C]\u3009(\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8) \u2192 \u3008[C]\u3009\u03d5 (18)\n(\u3008[C1]\u3009\u03d5 \u2227 \u3008[C2]\u3009\u03c8) \u2192 \u3008[C1 \u222a C2]\u3009(\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8)\nif C1 \u2229 C2 = \u2205 (19)\n\u03d5 \u2194 \u03c8\n\u3008[C]\u3009\u03d5 \u2194 \u3008[C]\u3009\u03c8 (20)\n\u3008[C]\u3009 satisfies additional principles that are proper to its spatial interpretation. For instance, it is easy to check that, under the previous interpretation, the following two formulas become valid:\n\u00ac\u3008[C]\u3009hi if i 6\u2208 C (21)\n([\u21d1]hi \u2228 [\u21d2]hi \u2228 [\u21d3]hi \u2228 [\u21d0]hi) \u2192 \u3008[{i}]\u3009hi (22)\nThe two validities captures the basic idea that an agent has exclusive control of her position in the sense that: (i) if coalition C does not include agent i then C cannot force i to be \u201chere\u201d, and (ii) agent i has the capability to move \u201chere\u201d if she is \u201caround\u201d.\nWe postpone to future work a more systematic analysis of the basic principles of the operator \u3008[C]\u3009 as well as a study of a strategic capability operator in the sense of ATL [1] based on the semantics of the logic DL-SM."}], "references": [{"title": "Alternating-time temporal logic", "author": ["R.

The most general logic includes (i) atomic formulas for representing the truth of a given fact or the presence of a given agent at a certain position of the plane, (ii) atomic programs corresponding to the four basic orientations in the plane (up, down, left, right) as well as the four program constructs of propositional dynamic logic PDL (sequential composition, nondeterministic composition, iteration and test). As this logic is not computably enumerable, we study some interesting decidable and axiomatizable fragments of it. We also present a decidable extension of the iteration-free fragment of the logic by special programs representing motion of agents in the plane.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
