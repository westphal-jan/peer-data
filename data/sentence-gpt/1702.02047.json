Although the PBTD coincides with the well-known recursive teaching dimension (RTD) on finite classes, it is radically different on infinite ones: the RTD becomes infinite already for trivial infinite classes (such as half-intervals) whereas the PBTD evaluates to reasonably small values for a wide collection of infinite classes including classes consisting of so-called closed sets w.r.t. a given closure operator, including various classes related to linear sets over $\\mathbb{N}_0$ (whose RTD had been studied quite recently) and including the class of Euclidean half-spaces. On top of presenting these concrete results, we provide the reader with a theoretical framework (of a combinatorial flavor) which helps to derive bounds on the PBTD. The concepts in which we show that the RTD does not satisfy this problem are the first to arrive at the theoretical framework (see \"Proposed-based teaching theory\"). Indeed, as discussed earlier, the proposed PBTD can only come into operation through a given set of closure operators (such as w.r.t. a given closure operator), i.e., the following functions satisfy the PBTD (see \"Proposed-based teaching theory\"). In practice, any notion of a given closure operator is bound to the general set of closure operators. We can only use these functions from within the PBTD to derive a number of classes as shown in the following diagram.\n\nThe concept of class ordering requires two basic concepts: class ordering--class ordering--in order to construct a set of closure operators. These concepts are defined as:\nclass class order=const x<(x:x:x:x:x; x:y:y:y; x:y:y; x:y:y; x:y:y; x:y:y; x:y:y; x:y:y; x:y:y; x:y:y; x:y:y; x:y:y; x:y:y; x:y:y; x:y:y; x:y:y; x:y:y; x:y:y; x:y:", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Feb 2017 18:40:32 GMT  (39kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02047v1", "35 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 8 Feb 2017 11:37:57 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02047v2", "35 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "35 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ziyuan gao", "christoph ries", "hans ulrich simon", "sandra zilles"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.02047"}, "pdf": {"name": "1702.02047.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": ["Ziyuan Gao", "Christoph Ries", "Hans Ulrich Simon", "Sandra Zilles"], "emails": ["gao257@cs.uregina.ca", "zilles@cs.uregina.ca", "christoph.ries@rub.de", "hans.simon@rub.de"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n02 04\n7v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 8\nKeywords: teaching dimension, preference relation, recursive teaching dimension, learning halfspaces, linear sets"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "The classical model of teaching [15,7] formulates the following interaction protocol between a teacher and a student:\n\u2013 Both of them agree on a \u201cclassification-rule system\u201d, formally given by a concept class L. \u2013 In order to teach a specific concept L \u2208 L, the teacher presents to the student a teaching set, i.e., a set T of labeled examples so that L is the only concept in L that is consistent with T . \u2013 The student determines L as the unique concept in L that is consistent with T .\nGoldman and Mathias [8] pointed out that this model of teaching is not powerful enough, since the teacher is required to make any consistent learner successful. A challenge is to model powerful teacher/student interactions without enabling unfair \u201ccoding tricks\u201d. Intuitively, the term \u201ccoding trick\u201d refers to any form of undesirable collusion\nbetween teacher and learner, which would reduce the learning process to a mere decoding of a code the teacher sent to the learner. There is no generally accepted definition of what constitutes a coding trick, in part because teaching an exact learner could always be considered coding to some extent: the teacher presents a set of examples which the learner \u201cdecodes\u201d into a concept.\nIn this paper, we adopt the notion of \u201cvalid teacher/learner pair\u201d introduced by [8]. They consider their model to be intuitively free of coding tricks while it provably allows for a much broader class of interaction protocols than the original teaching model. In particular, teaching may thus become more efficient in terms of the number of examples in the teaching sets. Further definitions of how to avoid unfair coding tricks have been suggested [18], but they were less stringent than the one proposed by Goldman and Mathias. The latter simply requests that, if the learner hypothesizes concept L upon seeing a sample set S of labeled examples, then the learner will still hypothesize L when presented with any sample set S \u222a S\u2032, where S\u2032 contains only examples labeled consistently with L. A coding trick would then be any form of exchange between the teacher and the learner that does not satisfy this definition of validity.\nThe model of recursive teaching [18,11], which is free of coding tricks according to the Goldman-Mathias definition, has recently gained attention because its complexity parameter, the recursive teaching dimension (RTD), has shown relations to the VCdimension and to sample compression [3,4,12,16], when focusing on finite concept classes. Below though we will give examples of rather simple infinite concept classes with infinite RTD, suggesting that the RTD is inadequate for addressing the complexity of teaching infinite classes.\nIn this paper, we introduce a model called preference-based teaching, in which the teacher and the student do not only agree on a classification-rule system L but also on a preference relation (a strict partial order) imposed on L. If the labeled examples presented by the teacher allow for several consistent explanations (= consistent concepts) in L, the student will choose a concept L \u2208 L that she prefers most. This gives more flexibility to the teacher than the classical model: the set of labeled examples need not distinguish a target concept L from any other concept in L but only from those concepts L\u2032 over which L is not preferred.3 At the same time, preference-based teaching yields valid teacher/learner pairs according to Goldman and Mathias\u2019s definition. We will show that the new model, despite avoiding coding tricks, is quite powerful. Moreover, as we will see in the course of the paper, it often allows for a very natural design of teaching sets.\nAssume teacher and student choose a preference relation that minimizes the worstcase number M of examples required for teaching any concept in the class L. This number M is then called the preference-based teaching dimension (PBTD) of L. In particular, we will show the following:\n(i) Recursive teaching is a special case of preference-based teaching where the preference relation satisfies a so-called \u201cfinite-depth condition\u201d. It is precisely this additional condition that renders recursive teaching useless for many natural and apparently\n3 Such a preference relation can be thought of as a kind of bias in learning: the student is \u201cbiased\u201d towards concepts that are preferred over others, and the teacher, knowing the student\u2019s bias, selects teaching sets accordingly.\nsimple infinite concept classes. Preference-based teaching successfully addresses these shortcomings of recursive teaching, see Section 3. For finite classes, PBTD and RTD are equal.\n(ii) A wide collection of geometric and algebraic concept classes with infinite RTD can be taught very efficiently, i.e., with low PBTD. To establish such results, we show in Section 4 that spanning sets can be used as preference-based teaching sets with positive examples only \u2014 a result that is very simple to obtain but quite useful.\n(iii) In the preference-based model, linear sets over N0 with origin 0 and at most k generators can be taught with k positive examples, while recursive teaching with a bounded number of positive examples was previously shown to be impossible and it is unknown whether recursive teaching with a bounded number of positive and negative examples is possible for k \u2265 4. We also give some almost matching upper and lower bounds on the PBTD for other classes of linear sets, see Section 6.\n(iv) The PBTD of halfspaces in Rd is upper-bounded by 6, independent of the dimensionality d (see Section 7), while its RTD is infinite.\n(v) We give full characterizations of concept classes that can be taught with only one example (or with only one example, which is positive) in the preference-based model (see Section 8).\nBased on our results and the naturalness of the teaching sets and preference relations used in their proofs, we claim that preference-based teaching is far more suitable to the study of infinite concept classes than recursive teaching.\nParts of this paper were published in a previous conference version [5]."}, {"heading": "2 Basic Definitions and Facts", "text": "N0 denotes the set of all non-negative integers and N denotes the set of all positive integers. A concept class L is a family of subsets over a universe X , i.e., L \u2286 2X where 2X denotes the powerset of X . The elements of L are called concepts. A labeled example is an element of X \u00d7{\u2212,+}. We slightly deviate from this notation in Section 7, where our treatment of halfspaces makes it more convenient to use {\u22121, 1} instead of {\u2212,+}, and in Section 8, where we perform Boolean operations on the labels and therefore use {0, 1} instead of {\u2212,+}. Elements of X are called examples. Suppose that T is a set of labeled examples. Let T+ = {x \u2208 X : (x,+) \u2208 T } and T\u2212 = {x \u2208 X : (x,\u2212) \u2208 T }. A set L \u2286 X is consistent with T if it includes all examples in T that are labeled \u201c+\u201d and excludes all examples in T that are labeled \u201c\u2212\u201d, i.e, if T+ \u2286 L and T\u2212 \u2229 L = \u2205. A set of labeled examples that is consistent with L but not with L\u2032 is said to distinguish L from L\u2032. The classical model of teaching is then defined as follows.\nDefinition 1 ([15,7]). A teaching set for a concept L \u2208 L w.r.t. L is a set T of labeled examples such that L is the only concept in L that is consistent with T , i.e., T distinguishes L from any other concept in L. Define TD(L,L) = inf{|T | : T is a teaching set for L w.r.t. L}. i.e., TD(L,L) is the smallest possible size of a teaching set for L w.r.t. L. If L has no finite teaching set w.r.t. L, then TD(L,L) = \u221e. The number TD(L) = supL\u2208LTD(L,L) \u2208 N0 \u222a {\u221e} is called the teaching dimension of L.\nFor technical reasons, we will occasionally deal with the number TDmin(L) = infL\u2208LTD(L, L), i.e., the number of examples needed to teach the concept from L that is easiest to teach.\nIn this paper, we will examine a teaching model in which the teacher and the student do not only agree on a classification-rule system L but also on a preference relation, denoted as \u227a, imposed on L. We assume that \u227a is a strict partial order on L, i.e., \u227a is asymmetric and transitive. The partial order that makes every pair L 6= L\u2032 \u2208 L incomparable is denoted by \u227a\u2205. For every L \u2208 L, let\nL\u227aL = {L\u2032 \u2208 L : L\u2032 \u227a L}\nbe the set of concepts over which L is strictly preferred. Note that L\u227a\u2205L = \u2205 for every L \u2208 L.\nAs already noted above, a teaching set T of L w.r.t. L distinguishes L from any other concept in L. If a preference relation comes into play, then T will be exempted from the obligation to distinguish L from the concepts in L\u227aL because L is strictly preferred over them anyway.\nDefinition 2. A teaching set for L \u2286 X w.r.t. (L,\u227a) is defined as a teaching set for L w.r.t. L \\ L\u227aL. Furthermore define\nPBTD(L,L,\u227a) = inf{|T | : T is a teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,\u227a)} \u2208 N0 \u222a {\u221e} .\nThe number PBTD(L,\u227a) = supL\u2208L PBTD(L,L,\u227a) \u2208 N0\u222a{\u221e} is called the teaching dimension of (L,\u227a).\nDefinition 2 implies that\nPBTD(L,L,\u227a) = TD(L,L \\ L\u227aL) . (1)\nLet L 7\u2192 T (L) be a mapping that assigns a teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,\u227a) to every L \u2208 L. It is obvious from Definition 2 that T must be injective, i.e., T (L) 6= T (L\u2032) if L and L\u2019 are distinct concepts from L. The classical model of teaching is obtained from the model described in Definition 2 when we plug in the empty preference relation \u227a\u2205 for \u227a. In particular, PBTD(L,\u227a\u2205) = TD(L).\nWe are interested in finding the partial order that is optimal for the purpose of teaching and we aim at determining the corresponding teaching dimension. This motivates the following notion:\nDefinition 3. The preference-based teaching dimension of L is given by\nPBTD(L) = inf{PBTD(L,\u227a) : \u227a is a strict partial order on L} .\nA relation R\u2032 on L is said to be an extension of a relation R if R \u2286 R\u2032. The order-extension principle states that any partial order has a linear extension [10]. The following result (whose second assertion follows from the first one in combination with the order-extension principle) is pretty obvious:\nLemma 1. 1. Suppose that \u227a\u2032 extends \u227a. If T is a teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,\u227a), then T is a teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,\u227a\u2032). Moreover PBTD(L,\u227a\u2032) \u2264 PBTD(L, \u227a).\n2. PBTD(L) = inf{PBTD(L,\u227a) : \u227a is a strict linear order on L}.\nRecall that Goldman and Mathias [8] suggested to avoid coding tricks by requesting that any superset S of a teaching set for a concept L remains a teaching set, if S is consistent with L. This property is obviously satisfied in preference-based teaching. A preference-based teaching set needs to distinguish a concept L from all concepts in L that are preferred over L. Adding more labeled examples from L to such a teaching set will still result in a set distinguishing L from all concepts in L that are preferred over L.\nPreference-based teaching with positive examples only. Suppose that L contains two concepts L,L\u2032 such that L \u2282 L\u2032. In the classical teaching model, any teaching set for L w.r.t. L has to employ a negative example in order to distinguish L from L\u2032. Symmetrically, any teaching set for L\u2032 w.r.t. L has to employ a positive example. Thus classical teaching cannot be performed with one type of examples only unless L is an antichain w.r.t. inclusion. As for preference-based teaching, the restriction to one type of examples is much less severe, as our results below will show.\nA teaching set T for L \u2208 L w.r.t. (L,\u227a) is said to be positive if it does not make use of negatively labeled examples, i.e., if T\u2212 = \u2205. In the sequel, we will occasionally identify a positive teaching set T with T+. A positive teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,\u227a) can clearly not distinguish L from a proper superset of L in L. Thus, the following holds:\nLemma 2. Suppose that L 7\u2192 T+(L) maps each L \u2208 L to a positive teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,\u227a). Then \u227a must be an extension of \u2283 (so that proper subsets of a set L are strictly preferred over L) and, for every L \u2208 L, the set T+(L) must distinguish L from every proper subset of L in L.\nDefine\nPBTD+(L,L,\u227a) = inf{|T | : T is a positive teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,\u227a)} . (2)\nThe number PBTD+(L,\u227a) = supL\u2208L PBTD+(L,L,\u227a) (possibly \u221e) is called the positive teaching dimension of (L,\u227a). The positive preference-based teaching dimension of L is then given by\nPBTD+(L) = inf{PBTD+(L,\u227a) : \u227a is a strict partial order on L} . (3)\nMonotonicity. A complexity measure K that assigns a numberK(L) \u2208 N0 to a concept class L is said to be monotonic if L\u2032 \u2286 L implies that K(L\u2032) \u2264 K(L). It is well known (and trivial to see) that TD is monotonic. It is fairly obvious that PBTD is monotonic, too:\nLemma 3. PBTD and PBTD+ are monotonic.\nAs an application of monotonicity, we show the following result:\nLemma 4. For every finite subclass L\u2032 of L, we have PBTD(L) \u2265 PBTD(L\u2032) \u2265 TDmin(L\u2032).\nProof. The first inequality holds because PBTD is monotonic. The second inequality follows from the fact that a finite partially ordered set must contain a minimal element. Thus, for any fixed choice of \u227a, L\u2032 must contain a concept L\u2032 such that L\u2032\u227aL\u2032 = \u2205. Hence,\nPBTD(L\u2032,\u227a) \u2265 PBTD(L\u2032,L\u2032,\u227a) (1)= TD(L\u2032,L\u2032\\L\u2032\u227aL\u2032) = TD(L\u2032,L\u2032) \u2265 TDmin(L\u2032) .\nSince this holds for any choice of \u227a, we get PBTD(L\u2032) \u2265 TDmin(L\u2032), as desired."}, {"heading": "3 Preference-based versus Recursive Teaching", "text": "The preference-based teaching dimension is a relative of the recursive teaching dimension. In fact, both notions coincide on finite classes, as we will see shortly. We first recall the definitions of the recursive teaching dimension and of some related notions [18,11].\nA teaching sequence for L is a sequence of the form S = (Li, di)i\u22651 where L1,L2,L3, . . . form a partition of L into non-empty sub-classes and, for every i \u2265 1, we have that\ndi = sup L\u2208Li\nTD ( L,L \\ \u222ai\u22121j=1Lj ) . (4)\nIf, for every i \u2265 1, di is the supremum over all L \u2208 Li of the smallest size of a positive teaching set for L w.r.t. \u222aj\u2265iLj (and di = \u221e if some L \u2208 Li does not have a positive teaching set w.r.t. \u222aj\u2265iLj), then S is said to be a positive teaching sequence for L. The order of a teaching sequence or a positive teaching sequence S (possibly \u221e) is defined as ord(S) = supi\u22651 di. The recursive teaching dimension of L (possibly \u221e) is defined as the order of the teaching sequence of lowest order for L. More formally, RTD(L) = infS ord(S) where S ranges over all teaching sequences for L. Similarly, RTD+(L) = infS ord(S), where S ranges over all positive teaching sequences for L. Note that the following holds for every L\u2032 \u2286 L and for every teaching sequence S = (Li, di)i\u22651 for L\u2032 such that ord(S) = RTD(L\u2032):\nRTD(L) \u2265 RTD(L\u2032) = ord(S) \u2265 d1 = sup L\u2208L1 TD(L,L\u2032) \u2265 TDmin(L\u2032) . (5)\nNote an important difference between PBTD and RTD: while RTD(L) \u2265 TDmin (L\u2032) for all L\u2032 \u2286 L, in general the same holds for PBTD only when restricted to finite L\u2032, cf. Lemma 4. This difference will become evident in the proof of Lemma 6.\nThe depth of L \u2208 L w.r.t. a strict partial order imposed on L is defined as the length of the longest chain in (L,\u227a) that ends with the \u227a-maximal element L (resp. as \u221e if there is no bound on the length of these chains). The recursive teaching dimension is related to the preference-based teaching dimension as follows:\nLemma 5. RTD(L) = inf\u227a PBTD(L,\u227a) and RTD+(L) = inf\u227a PBTD+(L,\u227a) where \u227a ranges over all strict partial orders on L that satisfy the following \u201cfinitedepth condition\u201d: every L \u2208 L has a finite depth w.r.t. \u227a.\nThe following is an immediate consequence of Lemma 5 and the trivial observation that the finite-depth condition is always satisfied if L is finite:\nCorollary 1. PBTD(L) \u2264 RTD(L), with equality if L is finite.\nWhile PBTD(L) and RTD(L) refer to the same finite number when L is finite, there are classes for which RTD is finite and yet larger than PBTD, as Lemma 6 will show. Generally, for infinite classes, the gap betweenPBTD andRTD can be arbitrarily large:\nLemma 6. There exists an infinite class L\u221e of VC-dimension 1 such that PBTD+ (L\u221e) = 1 and RTD(L\u221e) = \u221e. Moreover, for every k \u2265 1, there exists an infinite class Lk such that PBTD+(Lk) = 1 and RTD(Lk) = k.\nProof. We first show that there exists a class of VC-dimension 1, say L\u221e, such that PBTD+(L\u221e) = 1 while RTD(L\u221e) = \u221e. To this end, let L\u221e be the family of closed half-intervals over [0, 1), i.e., L\u221e = {[0, a] : 0 \u2264 a < 1}. We first prove that PBTD+(L\u221e) = 1. Consider the preference relation given by [0, b] \u227a [0, a] iff a < b. Then, for each 0 \u2264 a < 1, we have\nPBTD([0, a],L\u221e,\u227a) (1) = TD([0, a], {[0, b] : 0 \u2264 b \u2264 a}) = 1\nbecause the single example (a,+) suffices for distinguishing [0, a] from any interval [0, b] with b < a.\nIt was observed by [12] already that RTD(L\u221e) = \u221e because every teaching set for some [0, a] must contain an infinite sequence of distinct reals that converges from above to a. Thus, using Equation (5) with L\u2032 = L, we have RTD(L\u221e) \u2265 TDmin(L\u221e) = \u221e.\nNext we show that, for every k \u2265 1, there exists a class, say Lk, such that PBTD+ (Lk) = 1 while RTD(Lk) = k. To this end, let X = [0, 2). For each a \u2208 [0, 1), fix a binary representation \u2211 n\u22651 \u03b1n2\n\u2212n of a, where \u03b1n \u2208 {0, 1} are binary coefficients, and for all i = 1, . . . , k, let 1 \u2264 ai < 2 be given by ai = 1 + \u2211 n\u22650 \u03b1kn+i2 \u2212kn+i.4\nLet A be the set of all a \u2208 [0, 1) such that if \u2211n\u22651 \u03b1n2\u2212n is the binary representation of a fixed earlier, then for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , k}, there is some n \u2265 0 for which \u03b1nk+i 6= 0. Finally, let Ia = [0, a] \u222a {a1, . . . , ak} \u2286 X and let Lk = {Ia : 0 \u2264 a < 1 \u2227 a \u2208 A}. Clearly PBTD+(Lk) = 1 because, using the preference relation given by Ib \u227a Ia iff a < b, we can teach Ia w.r.t. Lk by presenting the single example (a,+) (the same strategy as for half-intervals). Moreover, note that Ia is the only concept in Lk that contains a1, . . . , ak, i.e., {a1, . . . , ak} is a positive teaching set for Ia w.r.t. Lk. It follows that RTD(Lk) \u2264 TD(Lk) \u2264 k. It remains to show that RTD(Lk) \u2265 k. To this end, we consider the subclass L\u2032k consisting of all concepts Ia such that a \u2208 A and a has only finitely many 1\u2019s in its binary representation (\u03b1n)n\u2208N, i.e., all but finitely\n4 Note that, for a = m 2N\nwith m,N \u2208 N, there are two binary representations. We can pick either one to define the \u03b1n and ai values.\nmany of the \u03b1n are zero. Pick any concept Ia \u2208 L\u2032k. Let T be any set of at most k \u2212 1 examples labeled consistently according to Ia. At least one of the positive examples a1, . . . , ak must be missing, say ai is missing. Let Ja,i be the set of indices given by Ja,i = {n \u2208 N0 : \u03b1kn+i = 0}. The following observations show that there exists some a\u2032 \u2208 X \\ {a} such that Ia\u2032 is consistent with T .\n\u2013 When we set some (at least one but only finitely many) of the bits \u03b1kn+i with n \u2208 Ja,i from 0 to 1 (while keeping fixed the remaining bits of the binary representation of a), then we obtain a number a\u2032 6= a such that Ia\u2032 is still consistent with all positive examples in T (including the example (a,+) which might be in T ).\n\u2013 Note that Ja,i is an infinite set. It is therefore possible to choose the bits that are set from 0 to 1 in such a fashion that the finitely many bit patterns represented by the numbers in T\u2212 \u2229 [1, 2) are avoided.\n\u2013 It is furthermore possible to choose the bits that are set from 0 to 1 in such a fashion that the resulting number a\u2032 is as close to a as we like so that Ia\u2032 is also consistent with the negative examples from T\u2212 \u2229 [0, 1) and a\u2032 \u2208 A.\nIt follows from this reasoning that no set with less than k examples can possibly be a teaching set for Ia. Since this holds for an arbitrary choice of a, we may conclude that RTD(Lk) \u2265 RTD(L\u2032k) \u2265 TDmin(L\u2032k) = k."}, {"heading": "4 Preference-based Teaching with Positive Examples Only", "text": "The main purpose of this section is to relate positive preference-based teaching to \u201cspanning sets\u201d and \u201cclosure operators\u201d, which are well-studied concepts in the computational learning theory literature.

L if S \u2286 L and any set in L that contains S must contain L as well.5 In other words, L is the unique smallest concept in L that contains S. We say that S \u2286 X is a weak spanning set of L \u2208 L w.r.t. L if S \u2286 L and S is not contained in any proper subset of L in L.6 We denote by I(L) (resp. I \u2032(L)) the smallest number k such that every concept L \u2208 L has a spanning set (resp. a weak spanning set) w.r.t. L of size at most k. Note that S is a spanning set of L w.r.t. L iff S distinguishes L from all concepts in L except for supersets of L, i.e., iff S is a positive teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,\u2283). Similarly, S is a weak spanning set of L w.r.t. L iff S distinguishes L from all its proper subsets in L (which is necessarily the case when S is a positive teaching set). These observations can be summarized as follows:\nI \u2032(L) \u2264 PBTD+(L) \u2264 PBTD+(L,\u2283) \u2264 I(L) . (6)\nThe last two inequalities are straightforward. The inequality I \u2032(L) \u2264 PBTD+(L) follows from Lemma 2, which implies that no concept L can have a preference-based\n5 This generalizes the classical definition of a spanning set [9], which is given w.r.t. intersectionclosed classes only. 6 Weak spanning sets have been used in the field of recursion-theoretic inductive inference under the name \u201ctell-tale sets\u201d [2].\nteaching set T smaller than its smallest weak spanning set. Such a set T would be consistent with some proper subset of L, which is impossible by Lemma 2.\nSuppose L is intersection-closed. Then \u2229L\u2208L:S\u2286LL is the unique smallest concept in L containing S. If S \u2286 L0 is a weak spanning set of L0 \u2208 L, then \u2229L\u2208L:S\u2286LL = L0 because, on the one hand, \u2229L\u2208L:S\u2286LL \u2286 L0 and, on the other hand, no proper subset of L0 in L contains S. Thus the distinction between spanning sets and weak spanning sets is blurred for intersection-closed classes:\nLemma 7. Suppose that L is intersection-closed. Then I \u2032(L) = PBTD+(L) = I(L).\nExample 1. Let Rd denote the class of d-dimensional axis-parallel hyper-rectangles (= d-dimensio- nal boxes). This class is intersection-closed and clearly I(Rd) = 2. Thus PBTD+(Rd) = 2.\nA mapping cl : 2X \u2192 2X is said to be a closure operator on the universe X if the following conditions hold for all sets A,B \u2286 X :\nA \u2286 B \u21d2 cl(A) \u2286 cl(B) and A \u2286 cl(A) = cl(cl(A)) .\nThe following notions refer to an arbitrary but fixed closure operator. The set cl(A) is called the closure of A. A set C is said to be closed if cl(C) = C. It follows that precisely the sets cl(A) with A \u2286 X are closed. With this notation, we observe the following lemma.\nLemma 8. Let C be the set of all closed subsets of X under some closure operator cl, and let L \u2208 C. If L = cl(S), then S is a spanning set of L w.r.t. C.\nProof. Suppose L\u2032 \u2208 C and S \u2286 L\u2032. Then L = cl(S) \u2286 cl(L\u2032) = L\u2032. For every closed set L \u2208 L, let scl(L) denote the size (possibly \u221e) of the smallest set S \u2286 X such that cl(S) = L. With this notation, we get the following (trivial but useful) result:\nTheorem 1. Given a closure operator, let C[m] be the class of all closed subsets C \u2286 X with scl(C) \u2264 m. Then PBTD+(C[m]) \u2264 PBTD+(C[m],\u2283) \u2264 m. Moreover, this holds with equality provided that C[m] \\ C[m\u2212 1] 6= \u2205.\nProof. The inequality PBTD+(C[m],\u2283) \u2264 m follows directly from Equation (6) and Lemma 8. Pick a concept C0 \u2208 C[m] such that scl(C0) = m. Then any subset S of C0 of size less than m spans only a proper subset of C0, i.e., cl(S) \u2282 C0. Thus S does not distinguish C0 from cl(S). However, by Lemma 2, any preference-based learner must strictly prefer cl(S) over C0. It follows that there is no positive teaching set of size less than m for C0 w.r.t. C[m].\nMany natural classes can be cast as classes of the form C[m] by choosing the universe and the closure operator appropriately; the following examples illustrate the usefulness of Theorem 1 in that regard.\nExample 2. Let\nLINSETk = {\u3008G\u3009 : (G \u2282 N) \u2227 (1 \u2264 |G| \u2264 k)}\nwhere \u3008G\u3009 = {\u2211 g\u2208G a(g)g : a(g) \u2208 N0 } . In other words, LINSETk is the set of all\nnon-empty linear subsets of N0 that are generated by at most k generators. Note that the mapping G 7\u2192 \u3008G\u3009 is a closure operator over the universe N0. Since obviously LINSETk \\ LINSETk\u22121 6= \u2205, we obtain PBTD+(LINSETk) = k.\nExample 3. Let X = R2 and let Ck be the class of convex polygons with at most k vertices. Defining cl(S) to be the convex closure of S, we obtain C[k] = Ck and thus PBTD+(Ck) = k.\nExample 4. Let X = Rn and let Ck be the class of polyhedral cones that can be generated by k (or less) vectors in Rn. If we take cl(S) to be the conic closure of S \u2286 Rn, then C[k] = Ck and thus PBTD+(Ck) = k."}, {"heading": "5 A Convenient Technique for Proving Upper Bounds", "text": "In this section, we give an alternative definition of the preference-based teaching dimension using the notion of an \u201cadmissible mapping\u201d.

We restrict ourselves to the proof for PBTD(L) = infT ord(T ) because the equation PBTD+(L) = infT+ ord(T+) can be obtained in a similar fashion. We first prove that PBTD(L)\u2264 infT ord(T ).

While semi-linear sets are of common interest in mathematics in general, they play a particularly important role in the theory of formal languages, due to Parikh\u2019s theorem, by which the so-called Parikh vectors of strings in a context-free language always form a semi-linear set [13].\nA recent study [6] analyzed computational teaching of classes of linear subsets of N (where k = 1) and some variants thereof, as a substantially simpler yet still interesting special case of semi-linear sets. In this section, we extend that study to preference-based teaching.\nWithin the scope of this section, all concept classes are formulated over the universe X = N0.

We will denote the all-zeros vector as 0. The vector with 1 in coordinate i and with 0 in the remaining coordinates is denoted as ei. The dimension of the Euclidean space in which these vectors reside will always be clear from the context. The sign of a real number x (with value 1 if x > 0, value \u22121 if x < 0, and value 0 if x = 0) is denoted by sign(x).\nSuppose that w \u2208 Rd \\ {0} and b \u2208 R. The (positive) halfspace induced by w and b is then given by\nHw,b = {x \u2208 Rd : w\u22a4x+ b \u2265 0} . Instead of Hw,0, we simply write Hw. Let Hd denote the class of d-dimensional Euclidean halfspaces:\nHd = {Hw,b : w \u2208 Rd \\ {0} \u2227 b \u2208 R} .\nSimilarly, H0d denotes the class of d-dimensional homogeneous Euclidean halfspaces:\nH0d = {Hw : w \u2208 Rd \\ {0}} .\nLet Sd\u22121 denote the (d \u2212 1)-dimensional unit sphere in Rd.

If not stated explicitly otherwise, we will represent homogeneous halfspaces with normalized vectors residing on the unit sphere. We remind the reader of the following well-known fact:\nRemark 1. The orthogonal group in dimension d (i.e., the multiplicative group of orthogonal (d\u00d7 d)-matrices) acts transitively on Sd\u22121 and it conserves the inner product.\nWe now prove a helpful lemma, stating that each vector w\u2217 in the northern hemisphere may serve as a representative for some homogeneous halfspace Hu in the sense that all other elements of Hu in the northern hemisphere have a strictly smaller d-th component than w\u2217. This will later help to teach homogeneous halfspaces with a preference that orders vectors by the size of their last coordinate.\nLemma 11. Let d \u2265 2, let 0 < h \u2264 1 and let Rd,h = {w \u2208 Sd\u22121 : wd = h}. With this notation the following holds.

For h = 1, the statement is trivial, since Rd,1 = {ed}. So let h < 1. Because of Remark 1, we may assume without loss of generality that the vector\nw\u2217 \u2208 Rd,h equals (0, . . . , 0, \u221a 1\u2212 h2, h). It suffices therefore to show that, with this choice of w\u2217, the vector u = (0, . . . , 0, w\u2217d,\u2212w\u2217d\u22121) satisfies (9). Note that w \u2208 Hu iff \u3008u,w\u3009 = w\u2217dwd\u22121 \u2212w\u2217d\u22121wd \u2265 0. Since \u3008u,w\u2217\u3009 = 0, we have w\u2217 \u2208 Hu. Moreover, it follows that\nS+d\u22121 \u2229Hu = { w \u2208 S+d\u22121 :\nwd\u22121 wd \u2265 w \u2217 d\u22121 w\u2217d > 0\n} .\nIt is obvious that no vector w \u2208 S+d\u22121 \u2229Hu can have a d-th component wd exceeding w\u2217d = h and that setting wd = h = w \u2217 d forces the settings wd\u22121 = w \u2217 d\u22121 = \u221a 1\u2212 h2 and w1 = . . . = wd\u22122 = 0. Consequently, (9) is satisfied, which concludes the proof. With this lemma in hand, we can now prove an upper bound of 2 for the preference-\nbased teaching dimension of the class of homogeneous halfspaces, independent of the underlying dimension d.\nTheorem 3. PBTD(H01) = TD(H01) = 1 and, for every d \u2265 2, we have PBTD(H0d) \u2264 2. Proof. Clearly, PBTD(H01) = TD(H01) = 1 since H01 consists of the two sets {x \u2208 R\n: x \u2265 0} and {x \u2208 R : x \u2264 0}. Suppose now that d \u2265 2. Let w\u2217 be the target weight vector (i.e., the weight vector that has to be taught). Under the following conditions, we may assume without loss of generality that w\u2217d 6= 0:\n\u2013 For any 0 < s1 < s2, the student prefers any weight vector that ends with s2 zero coordinates over any weight vector that ends with only s1 zero coordinates. \u2013 If the target vector ends with (exactly) s zero coordinates, then the teacher presents only examples ending with (at least) s zero coordinates.\nIn the sequel, we specify a student and a teacher such that these conditions hold, so that we will consider only target weight vectors w\u2217 with w\u2217d 6= 0. The student has the following preference relation:\n\u2013 Among the weight vectors w with wd 6= 0, the student prefers vectors with larger values of |wd| over those with smaller values of |wd|.\nThe teacher will use two examples. The first one is chosen as { (\u2212ed,\u2212) if w\u2217d > 0 (ed,\u2212) if w\u2217d < 0 .\nThis example reveals whether the unknown weight vector w\u2217 \u2208 Sd\u22121 has a strictly positive or a strictly negative d-th component. For reasons of symmetry, we may assume\nthat w\u2217d > 0. We are now precisely in the situation that is described in Lemma 11. Given w\u2217 and h = w\u2217d , the teacher picks as a second example (u,+) where u \u2208 Rd \\ {0} has the properties described in the lemma. It follows immediately that the student\u2019s preferences will make her choose the weight vector w\u2217.\nThe upper bound of 2 given in Theorem 3 is tight, as is stated in the following lemma.\nLemma 12. For every d \u2265 2, we have PBTD(H0d) \u2265 2. Proof. We verify this lemma via Lemma 4, by providing a finite subclass F of H02 such that TDmin(F) = 2. Let F = {Hw : 0 6= w \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1}2}. It is easy to verify that each of the 8 halfspaces in F has a teaching dimension of 2 with respect to F . This example can be extended to higher dimensions in the obvious way.\nWe thus conclude that the class of homogeneous halfspaces has a preference-based teaching dimension of 2, independent of the dimensionality d \u2265 2. Corollary 2. For every d \u2265 2, we have PBTD(H0d) = 2.\nBy contrast, we will show next that the recursive teaching dimension of the class of homogeneous halfspaces grows with the dimensionality.\nTheorem 4. For any d \u2265 2, TD(H0d) = RTD(H0d) = d+ 1. Proof. Assume by normalization that the target weight vector has norm 1, i.e., it is taken from Sd\u22121. Remark 1 implies that all weight vectors in Sd\u22121 are equally hard to teach. It suffices therefore to show that TD(He1 ,H0d) = d+ 1.\nWe first show that TD(He1 ,H0d) \u2264 d + 1. Define u = \u2212 \u2211d\ni=2 ei. We claim that T = {(ei,+) : 2 \u2264 i \u2264 d} \u222a {(u,+), (e1,+)} is a teaching set for He1 w.r.t. H0d. Consider any w \u2208 Sd\u22121 such that Hw is consistent with T . Note that wi = \u3008ei, w\u3009 \u2265 0 for all i \u2208 {2, . . . , d} and \u3008u,w\u3009 = \u2212\u2211di=2 wi \u2265 0 together imply that wi = 0 for all i \u2208 {2, . . . , d} and therefore w = \u00b1e1. Furthermore, w1 = \u3008w, e1\u3009 \u2265 0, and so w = e1, as required.\nNow we show that TD(He1 ,H0d) \u2265 d + 1 holds for all d \u2265 2. It is easy to see that two examples do not suffice for distinguishing e1 \u2208 R2 from all weight vectors in S1. In other words, TD(He1 ,H02) \u2265 3. Suppose now that d \u2265 3. It is furthermore easy to see that a teaching set T which distinguishes e1 from all weight vectors in Sd\u22121 must contain at least one positive example u that is orthogonal to e1. The inequality TD(He1 ,H0d) \u2265 d + 1 is now obtained inductively because the example (u,+) \u2208 T leaves open a problem that is not easier than teaching e1 w.r.t. the (d\u2212 2)-dimensional sphere {x \u2208 Sd\u22121 : x \u22a5 u}.\nWe have thus established that the class of homogeneous halfspaces has a recursive teaching dimension growing linearly with d, while its preference-based teaching dimension is constant. In the case of general (i.e., not necessarily homogeneous) ddimensional halfspaces, the difference between RTD and PBTD is even more extreme. On the one hand, by generalizing the proof of Lemma 6, it is easy to see that RTD(Hd) = \u221e for all d \u2265 1. On the other hand, we will show in the remainder of this section that PBTD(Hd) \u2264 6, independent of the value of d.\nWe will assume in the sequel (by way of normalization) that an inhomogeneous halfspace has a bias b \u2208 {\u00b11}. We start with the following result:\nLemma 13. Let w\u2217 \u2208 Rd be a vector with a non-trivial d-th componentw\u2217d 6= 0 and let b\u2217 \u2208 {\u00b11} be a bias. Then there exist three examples labeled according to Hw\u2217,b\u2217 such that the following holds. Every weight-bias pair (w, b) consistent with these examples satisfies b = b\u2217, sign(wd) = sign(w\u2217d) and\n{ |wd| \u2265 |w\u2217d| if b\u2217 = \u22121 |wd| \u2264 |w\u2217d| if b\u2217 = +1 . (10)\nProof. Within the proof, we use the label \u201c1\u201d instead of \u201c+\u201d and the label \u201c\u22121\u201d instead of \u201c\u2212\u201d. The pair (w, b) denotes the student\u2019s hypothesis for the target weight-bias pair (w\u2217, b\u2217). The examples shown to the student will involve the unknown quantities w\u2217 and b\u2217. Each example will lead to a new constraint on w and b. We will see that the collection of these constraints reveals the required information. We proceed in three stages:\n1. The first example is chosen as (0, b\u2217). The pair (w, b) can be consistent with this example only if b = \u22121 in the case that b\u2217 = \u22121 and b \u2208 {0, 1} in the case that b\u2217 = 1. 2. The next example is chosen as a2 = \u2212 2b \u2217\nw\u2217 d \u00b7 ed and labeled \u201c\u2212b\u2217\u201d. Note that \u3008w\u2217,a2\u3009+ b\u2217 = \u2212b\u2217. We obtain the following new constraint:\n\u3008w,a2\u3009+ b =    \u22122wdw\u2217 d + \u2208{0,1}\ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37 b < 0 if b\u2217 = 1 +2wdw\u2217 d\n+ b\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38 =\u22121\n\u2265 0 if b\u2217 = \u22121 .\nThe pair (w, b) with b = b\u2217 if b\u2217 = \u22121 and b \u2208 {0, 1} if b\u2217 = 1 can satisfy the above constraint only if the sign of wd equals the sign of w\u2217d .\n3. The third example is chosen as the example a3 = \u2212 b \u2217\nw\u2217 d \u00b7 ed with label \u201c1\u201d. Note that \u3008w\u2217,a3\u3009\u2217 + b\u2217 = 0. We obtain the following new constraint:\n\u3008w,a3\u3009 = \u2212 b\u2217wd w\u2217d + b \u2265 0 .\nGiven that w is already constrained to weight vectors satisfying sign(wd) = sign( w\u2217d), we can safely replace wd/w \u2217 d by |wd|/|w\u2217d|. This yields |wd|/|w\u2217d| \u2264 b if b\u2217 = 1 and |wd|/|w\u2217d| \u2265 \u2212b if b\u2217 = \u22121. Since b is already constrained as described in stage 1 above, we obtain |wd|/|w\u2217d| \u2264 b \u2208 {0, 1} if b\u2217 = 1 and |wd|/|w\u2217d| \u2265 \u2212b = 1 if b\u2217 = \u22121. The weight-bias pair (w, b) satisfies these constraints only if b = b\u2217 and if (10) is valid.\nThe assertion of the lemma is immediate from this discussion.\nTheorem 5. PBTD(Hd) \u2264 6.\nProof. As in the proof of Lemma 13, we use the label \u201c1\u201d instead of \u201c+\u201d and the label \u201c\u22121\u201d instead of \u201c\u2212\u201d. As in the proof of Theorem 3, we may assume without loss\nof generality that the target weight vector w\u2217 \u2208 Rd satisfies w\u2217d 6= 0. The proof will proceed in stages. On the way, we specify six rules which determine the preference relation of the student.\nStage 1 is concerned with teaching homogeneous halfspaces given by w\u2217 (and b\u2217 = 0). The student respects the following rules:\nRule 1: She prefers any pair (w, 0) over any pair (w\u2032, b) with b 6= 0. In other words, any homogeneous halfspace is preferred over any non-homogeneous halfspace.\nRule 2: Among homogeneous halfspaces, her preferences are the same as the ones that were used within the proof of Theorem 3 for teaching homogeneous halfspaces.\nThus, if b\u2217 = 0, then we can simply apply the teaching protocol for homogeneous halfspaces. In this case, w\u2217 can be taught at the expense of only two examples.\nStage 1 reduces the problem to teaching inhomogeneous halfspaces given by (w\u2217, b\u2217) with b\u2217 6= 0. We assume, by way of normalization, that b\u2217 \u2208 {\u00b11}, but note that w\u2217 can now not be assumed to be of unit (or any other fixed) length.\nIn stage 2, the teacher presents three examples in accordance with Lemma 13. It follows that the student will take into consideration only weight-bias pairs (w, b) such that the constraints b = b\u2217, sign(wd) = sign(w\u2217d) and (10) are satisfied. The following rule will then induce the constraint wd = w\u2217d:\nRule 3: Among the pairs (w, b) such that wd 6= 0 and b \u2208 {\u00b11}, the student\u2019s preferences are as follows. If b = \u22121 (resp. b = 1), then she prefers vectors w with a smaller (resp. larger) value of |wd| over those with a larger (resp. smaller) value of |wd|.\nThanks to Lemma 13 and thanks to Rule 3, we may from now on assume that b = b\u2217 and wd = w\u2217d. In the sequel, let w \u2217 be decomposed according to w\u2217 = (w\u2217d\u22121, w \u2217 d) \u2208\nR d\u22121 \u00d7R. We think of wd\u22121 as the student\u2019s hypothesis for w\u2217d\u22121. Stage 3 is concerned with the special case where w\u2217d\u22121 = 0. The student will automatically set wd\u22121 = 0 if we add the following to the student\u2019s rule system:\nRule 4: Given that the values for wd and b have been fixed already (and are distinct from 0), the student prefers weight-bias pairs with wd\u22121 = 0 over any weight-bias pair with wd\u22121 6= 0.\nStage 3 reduces the problem to teaching (w\u2217, b\u2217) with fixed non-zero values for wd and b\u2217 (known to the student) and with w\u2217d\u22121 6= 0. Thus, essentially, only w\u2217d\u22121 has still to be taught. In the next stage, we will argue that the problem of teaching w\u2217d\u22121 is equivalent to teaching a homogeneous halfspace.\nIn stage 4, the teacher will present only examples a such that ad = \u2212 b \u2217\nw\u2217 d so that the contribution of the d-th component to the inner product of w\u2217 and a cancels with the bias b\u2217. Given this commitment for ad, the first d\u2212 1 components of the examples can be chosen so as to teach the homogeneous halfspace Hw\u2217\nd\u22121 . According to Theorem 3,\nthis can be achieved at the expense of two more examples. Of course the student\u2019s preferences must match with the preferences that were used in the proof of this theorem:\nRule 5: Suppose that the values of wd and b have been fixed already (and are distinct from 0) and suppose that wd\u22121 6= 0. Then the preferences for the choice of wd\u22121 match with the preferences that were used in the protocol for teaching homogeneous halfspaces.\nAfter stage 4, the student takes into consideration only weight-bias pairs (w, b) such that wd = w\u2217d , b = b\n\u2217 and Hwd\u22121 = Hw\u2217d\u22121 . However, since we had normalized the bias and not the weight vector, this does not necessarily mean that wd\u22121 = w\u2217d\u22121. On the other hand, the two weight vectors already coincide modulo a positive scaling factor, say wd\u22121 = s \u00b7w\u2217d\u22121 for some s > 0 . (11) In order to complete the proof, it suffices to teach the L1-norm of w\u2217d\u22121 to the student (because (11) and \u2016wd\u22121\u20161 = \u2016w\u2217d\u22121\u20161 imply that wd\u22121 = w\u2217d\u22121). The next (and final) stage serves precisely this purpose.\nAs for stage 5, we first fix some notation. For i = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1, let \u03b2i = sign(w\u2217i ). Note that (11) implies that \u03b2i = sign(wi). Let L = \u2016w\u2217d\u22121\u20161 denote the L1-norm of w\n\u2217 d\u22121. The final example is chosen as a6 = (\u03b21, . . . , \u03b2d\u22121,\u2212(L+b\u2217)/w\u2217d) and labeled\n\u201c1\u201d. Note that\n\u3008w\u2217,a6\u3009+ b\u2217 = |w\u22171 |+ . . .+ |w\u2217d\u22121| \u2212 L = 0 .\nGiven that \u03b2i = sign(wi), wd = w\u2217d and b = b \u2217, the student can derive from a6 and its label the following constraint on wd\u22121:\n\u3008w,a6\u3009+ b = |w1|+ . . .+ |wd\u22121| \u2212 L \u2265 0 .\nIn combination with the following rule, we can now force the constraint \u2016wd\u22121\u20161 = L: Rule 6: Suppose that the values of wd and b have been fixed already (and are distinct\nfrom 0) and suppose that Hwd\u22121 has already been fixed. Then, among the vectors representing Hwd\u22121 , the ones with a smaller L1-norm are preferred over the ones with a larger L1-norm.\nAn inspection of the six stages reveals that at most six examples altogether were shown to the student (three in stage 2, two in stage 4, and one in stage 5). This completes the proof of the theorem.\nNote that Theorems 3 and 5 remain valid when we allow w to be the all-zero vector, which extends H0d by {Rd} and Hd by {Rd, \u2205}. Rd will be taught with a single positive example, and \u2205 with a single negative example. The student will give the highest preference to Rd, the second highest to \u2205, and among the remaining halfspaces, the student\u2019s preferences stay the same.\n8 Classes with PBTD or PBTD+ Equal to One\nIn this section, we will give complete characterizations of (i) the concept classes with a positive preference-based teaching dimension of 1, and (ii) the concept classes with\na preference-based teaching dimension of 1. Throughout this section, we use the label \u201c1\u201d to indicate positive examples and the label \u201c0\u201d to indicate negative examples.\nLet I be a (possibly infinite) index set. We will consider a mapping A : I \u00d7 I \u2192 {0, 1} as a binary matrix A \u2208 {0, 1}I\u00d7I . A is said to be lower-triangular if there exists a linear ordering \u227a on I such that A(i, i\u2032) = 0 for every pair (i, i\u2032) such that i \u227a i\u2032.\nWe will occasionally identify a set L \u2286 X with its indicator function by setting L(x) = 1[x\u2208L]. For each M \u2286 X , we define\nM \u2295 L = (L \\M) \u222a (M \\ L)\nand M \u2295 L = {M \u2295 L : L \u2208 L} .\nFor T \u2286 X \u00d7 {0, 1}, we define similarly\nM \u2295 T = {(x, y\u0304) : (x, y) \u2208 T and x \u2208 M} \u222a {(x, y) \u2208 T : x /\u2208 M} .\nMoreover, given M \u2286 X and a linear ordering \u227a on L, we define a linear ordering \u227aM on M \u2295 L as follows:\nM \u2295 L\u2032 \u227aM M \u2295 L \u21d0\u21d2 M \u2295 (M \u2295 L\u2032)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 =L\u2032 \u227a M \u2295 (M \u2295 L)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 =L .\nLemma 14. With this notation, the following holds. If the mapping L \u220b L 7\u2192 T (L) \u2286 X\u00d7{0, 1} assigns a teaching set toL w.r.t. (L,\u227a), then the mappingM\u2295L \u220b M\u2295L 7\u2192 M \u2295 T (L) \u2286 X \u00d7 {0, 1} assigns a teaching set to M \u2295 L w.r.t. (M \u2295 L,\u227aM ).\nSince this result is rather obvious, we skip its proof. We say that L and L\u2032 are equivalent if L\u2032 = M \u2295 L for some M \u2286 X (and this\nclearly is an equivalence relation). As an immediate consequence of Lemma 14, we obtain the following result:\nLemma 15. If L is equivalent to L\u2032, then PBTD(L) = PBTD(L\u2032).\nThe following lemma provides a necessary condition for a concept class to have a preference-based teaching dimension of one.\nLemma 16. Suppose thatL \u2286 2X is a concept class of PBTD1. Pick a linear ordering \u227a on L and a mapping L \u220b L 7\u2192 (xL, yL) \u2208 X \u00d7 {0, 1} such that, for every L \u2208 L, {(xL, yL)} is a teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,\u227a). Then\n\u2013 either every instance x \u2208 X occurs at most once in (xL)L\u2208L \u2013 or there exists a concept L\u2217 \u2208 L that is preferred over all other concepts in L and xL\u2217 is the only instance from X that occurs twice in (xL)L\u2208L.\nProof. Since the mapping T must be injective, no instance can occur twice in (xL)L\u2208L with the same label. Suppose that there exists an instance x \u2208 X and concepts L \u227a L\u2217 such that x = xL = xL\u2217 and, w.l.o.g., yL = 1 and yL\u2217 = 0. Since {(x, 1)} is a teaching\nset for L w.r.t. (L,\u227a), every concept L\u2032 \u227b L (including the ones that are preferred over L\u2217) must satisfy L\u2032(x) = 0. For analogous reasons, every concept L\u2032 \u227b L\u2217 (if any) must satisfy L\u2032(x) = 1. A concept L\u2032 \u2208 L that is preferred over L\u2217 would have to satisfy L\u2032(x) = 0 and L\u2032(x) = 1, which is impossible. It follows that there can be no concept that is preferred over L\u2217.\nThe following result is a consequence of Lemmas 14 and 16.\nTheorem 6. If PBTD(L) = 1, then there exists a concept class L\u2032 that is equivalent to L and satisfies PBTD(L\u2032) = PBTD+(L\u2032) = 1.\nProof. Pick a linear ordering \u227a on L and, for every L \u2208 L, a pair (xL, yL) \u2208 X \u00d7 {0, 1} such that T (L) = {(xL, yL)} is a teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,\u227a).\nCase 1: Every instance x \u2208 X occurs at most once in (xL)L\u2208L. Then choose M = {xL : yL = 0} and apply Lemma 14. Case 2: There exists a concept L\u2217 \u2208 L that is preferred over all other concepts in L and xL\u2217 is the only instance from X that occurs twice in (xL)L\u2208L. Then choose M = {xL : yL = 0 \u2227 L 6= L\u2217} and apply Lemma 14. With this choice, we obtain M \u2295 T (L) = {(xL, 1)} for every L \u2208 L \\ {L\u2217}. Since L\u2217 is preferred over all other concepts in L, we may teach L\u2217 w.r.t. (L,\u227a) by the empty set (instead of employing a possibly 0-labeled example).\nThe discussion shows that there is a class L\u2032 that is equivalent to L and can be taught in the preference-based model with positive teaching sets of size 1 (or size 0 in case of L\u2217).\nWe now have the tools required for characterizing the concept classes whose positive PBTD equals 1.\nTheorem 7. PBTD+(L) = 1 if and only if there exists a mapping L \u220b L 7\u2192 xL \u2208 X such that the matrix A \u2208 {0, 1}(L\\{\u2205})\u00d7(L\\{\u2205}) given by A(L,L\u2032) = L\u2032(xL) is lowertriangular.\nProof. Suppose first that PBTD+(L) = 1. Pick a linear ordering \u227a on L and, for every L \u2208 L \\ {\u2205}, pick xL \u2208 X such that {xL} is a positive teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,\u227a).8 If L \u227a L\u2032 (so that L\u2032 is preferred over L), we must have L\u2032(xL) = 0. It follows that the matrix A, as specified in the theorem, is lower-triangular.\nSuppose conversely that there exists a mapping L \u220b L 7\u2192 xL \u2208 X such that the matrix A \u2208 {0, 1}(L\\{\u2205})\u00d7(L\\{\u2205}) given by A(L,L\u2032) = L\u2032(xL) is lower-triangular, say w.r.t. the linear ordering \u227a on L \\ {\u2205}. Then, for every L \u2208 L \\ {\u2205}, the singleton {xL} is a positive teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,\u227a) because it distinguishes L from \u2205 (of course) and also from every concept L\u2032 \u2208 L \\ {\u2205} such that L\u2032 \u227b L. If \u2205 \u2208 L, then extend the linear ordering \u227a by preferring \u2205 over every other concept from L (so that \u2205 is a positive teaching set for \u2205 w.r.t. (L,\u227a)).\n8 Such an xL always exists, even if \u2205 is a teaching set for L, because every superset of a teaching set for L that is still consistent withL is still a teaching set for L, cf. the discussion immediately after Lemma 1.\nIn view of Theorem 6, Theorem 7 characterizes every class L with PBTD(L) = 1 up to equivalence.\nLet Sg(X ) = {{x} : x \u2208 X} denote the class of singletons over X and suppose that Sg(X ) is a sub-class of L and PBTD(L) = 1. We will show that only fairly trivial extensions of Sg(X ) with a preference-based dimension of 1 are possible.\nLemma 17. Let L \u2286 2X be a concept class of PBTD 1 that contains Sg(X ). Let T be an admissible mapping for L that assigns a labeled example (xL, yL) \u2208 X \u00d7 {0, 1} to each L \u2208 L. For b = 0, 1, let Lb = {L \u2208 L : yL = b}. Similarly, let X b = {x \u2208 X : y{x} \u2208 Lb}. With this notation, the following holds: 1. If L \u2208 L1 and L \u2282 L\u2032 \u2208 L, then L\u2032 \u2208 L1. 2. If L\u2032 \u2208 L0 and L\u2032 \u2283 L \u2208 L, then L \u2208 L0. 3. |X 0| \u2264 2. Moreover if |X 0| = 2, then there exist q 6= q\u2032 \u2208 X such that X 0 =\n{q, q\u2032} and x{q} = q\u2032.\nProof. Recall that RT = {(L,L\u2032) \u2208 L\u00d7L : (L 6= L\u2032)\u2227(L is consistent with T (L\u2032))} and that RT (and even the transitive closure of RT ) is asymmetric if T is admissible.\n1. If L \u2208 L1 and L \u2282 L\u2032, then yL = 1 so that L\u2032 is consistent with the example (xL, yL). It follows that (L\u2032, L) \u2208 RT . L\u2032 \u2208 L0 would similarly imply that (L,L\u2032) \u2208 RT so that RT would not be asymmetric. This is in contradiction with the admissibility of T .\n2. The second assertion in the lemma is a logically equivalent reformulation of the first assertion. 3. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that X 0 contains three distinct points, say q1, q2, q3. Since, for i = 1, 2, 3, T assigns a 0-labeled example to {qi}, at least one of the remaining two points is consistent with T ({qi}). Let G be the digraph with the nodes q1, q2, q3 and with an edge from qj to qi iff {qj} is consistent with T ({qi}). Then each of the three nodes has an indegree of at least 1. Digraphs of this form must contain a cycle so that trcl(RT ) is not asymmetric. This is in contradiction with the admissibility of RT . A similar argument holds if X 0 contains only two distinct elements, say q and q\u2032. If neither x{q} = q\u2032 nor x{q\u2032} = q, then ({q\u2032}, {q}) \u2208 RT and ({q}, {q\u2032}) \u2208 RT so that RT is not asymmetric \u2014 again a contradiction to the admissibility of RT .\nWe are now in the position to characterize those classes of PBTD one that contain all singletons.\nTheorem 8. Suppose that L \u2286 2X is a concept class that contains Sg(X ). Then PBTD(L) = 1 if and only if the following holds. Either L coincides with Sg(X ) or L contains precisely one additional concept, which is either the empty set or a set of size 2.\nProof. We start with proving \u201c\u21d0\u201d. It is well known that PBTD+(L) = 1 for L = Sg(X ) \u222a {\u2205}: prefer \u2205 over any singleton set, set T (\u2205) = \u2205 and, for every x \u2208 X , set T ({x}) = {(x, 1)}. In a similar fashion, we can show that PBTD(L) = 1 for L = Sg(X )\u222a{{q, q\u2032}} for any choice of q 6= q\u2032 \u2208 X . Prefer {q, q\u2032} over {q} and {q\u2032},\nrespectively. Furthermore, prefer {q} and {q\u2032} over all other singletons. Finally, set T ({q, q\u2032}) = \u2205, T ({q}) = {(q\u2032, 0)}, T ({q\u2032}) = {(q, 0)} and, for every x \u2208 X \\{q, q\u2032}, set T ({x}) = {(x, 1)}.\nAs for the proof of \u201c\u21d2\u201d, we make use of the notions T, xL, yL,L0,L1,X 0,X 1 that had been introduced in Lemma 17 and we proceed by case analysis.\nCase 1: X 0 = \u2205. Since X 0 = \u2205, we have X = X 1. In combination with the first assertion in Lemma 17, it follows that L \\ {\u2205} = L1. We claim that no concept in L contains two distinct elements. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there is a concept L \u2208 L such that |L| \u2265 2. It follows that, for every q \u2208 L, x{q} = q and y{q} = 1 so that (L, {q}) \u2208 RT . Moreover, there exists q0 \u2208 L such that xL = q0 and yL = 1. It follows that ({q0}, L) \u2208 RT , which contradicts the fact that RT is asymmetric. Case 2: X 0 = {q} for some q \u2208 X . Set q\u2032 = x{q} and note that y{q} = 0. Moreover, since X 1 = X \\ {q}, we have x{p} = p and y{p} = 1 for every p \u2208 X \\ {q}. We claim that L cannot contain a concept L of size at least 2 that contains an element of X \\ {q, q\u2032}. Assume for the sake of contradiction, that there is a set L such that |L| \u2265 2 and p \u2208 L for some p \u2208 X \\ {q, q\u2032}. The first assertion in Lemma 17 implies that yL = 1 (because y{p} = 1 and {p} \u2286 L). Since all pairs (x, 1) with x 6= q are already in use for teaching the corresponding singletons, we may conclude that q \u2208 L and T (L) = {(q, 1)}. This contradicts the fact that trcl(RT ) is asymmetric, because our discussion implies that (L, {p}), ({p}, {q}), ({q}, L) \u2208 RT . We may therefore safely assume that there is no concept of size at least 2 in L that has a non-empty intersection with X \\ {q, q\u2032}. Thus, except for the singletons, the only remaining sets that possibly belong to L are \u2205 and {q, q\u2032}. We still have to show that not both of them can belong to L. Assume for the sake of contradiction that \u2205, {q, q\u2032} \u2208 L. Since \u2205 is consistent with T ({q}) = {(q\u2032, 0)}, we have (\u2205, {q}) \u2208 RT . Clearly, y\u2205 = 0. Since {q} is consistent with every pair (x, 0) except for (q, 0), we must have x\u2205 = q. (Otherwise, we have ({q}, \u2205) \u2208 RT and arrive at a contradiction.) Let us now inspect the possible teaching sets for L = {q, q\u2032}. Since {q, q\u2032} is consistent with T ({q\u2032}) = {(q\u2032, 1)}, setting yL = 0 would lead to a contradiction. The example (q\u2032, 1) is already in use for teaching {q\u2032}. It is therefore necessary to set T (L) = {(q, 1)}. An inspection of the various teaching sets shows that (\u2205, {q}), ({q}, L), (L, {q\u2032}), ({q\u2032}, \u2205) \u2208 RT , which contradicts the fact that trcl(RT ) is asymmetric. Case 3: X 0 = {q, q\u2032} for some q 6= q\u2032 \u2208 X . Note first that y{q} = y{q\u2032} = 0 and y{p} = 1 for every p \u2208 X \\ {q, q\u2032}. We claim that \u2205 /\u2208 L. Assume for the sake of contradiction that \u2205 \u2208 L. Then (\u2205, {q}), (\u2205, {q\u2032}) \u2208 RT since \u2205 is consistent with the teaching sets for instances from X 0. But then, no matter how x in T (\u2205) = {(x, 0)} is chosen, at least one of the sets {q} and {q\u2032} will be consistent with T (\u2205) so that at least one of the pairs ({q}, \u2205) and ({q\u2032}, \u2205) belongs to RT . This contradicts the fact that RT must be asymmetric. Thus \u2205 /\u2208 L, indeed. Now it suffices to show that L cannot contain a concept of size at least 2 that contains an element of X \\ {q, q\u2032}. Assume\nfor the sake of contradiction that there is a set L \u2208 L such that |L| \u2265 2 and p \u2208 L for some p \u2208 X \\ {q, q\u2032}. Observe that (L, {p}) \u2208 RT . Another application of the first assertion in Lemma 17 shows that yL = 1 (because y{p} = 1 and p \u2208 L) and xL \u2208 {q, q\u2032} (because the other 1-labeled instances are already in use for teaching the corresponding singletons). It follows that one of the pairs ({q}, L) and ({q\u2032}, L) belongs to RT . The third assertion of Lemma 17 implies that T (q) = {(q\u2032, 0)} or T (q\u2032) = {(q, 0)}. For reasons of symmetry, we may assume that T (q) = {(q\u2032, 0)}. This implies that ({p}, {q}) \u2208 RT . Let q\u2032\u2032 be given by T (q\u2032) = {(q\u2032\u2032, 0)}. Note that either q\u2032\u2032 = q or q\u2032\u2032 \u2208 X \\ {q, q\u2032}. In the former case, we have that ({p}, {q\u2032}) \u2208 RT and in the latter case we have that ({q}, {q\u2032}) \u2208 RT . Since ({p}, {q}) \u2208 RT (which was observed above already), we conclude that in both cases, ({p}, {q}), ({p}, {q\u2032}) \u2208 trcl(RT ). Combining this with our observations above that (L, {p}) \u2208 RT and that one of the pairs ({q}, L) and ({q\u2032}, L) belongs to RT , yields a contradiction to the fact that trcl(RT ) is asymmetric.\nCorollary 3. Let L \u2286 2X be a concept class that contains Sg(X ). If PBTD(L) = 1, then RTD(L) = 1.\nProof. According to Theorem 8, eitherL coincides with Sg(X ) or L contains precisely one additional concept that is \u2205 or a set of size 2. The partial ordering \u227a on L that is used in the first part of the proof of Theorem 8 (proof direction \u201c\u21d0\u201d) is easily compiled into a recursive teaching plan of order 1 for L.9\nThe characterizations proven above can be applied to certain geometric concept classes.\nConsider a class L, consisting of bounded and topologically closed objects in the d-dimensional Euclidean space, that satisfies the following condition: for every pair (A,B) \u2208 Rd, there is exactly one object in L, denoted as LA,B in the sequel, such that A,B \u2208 L and such that \u2016A \u2212 B\u2016 coincides with the diameter of L. This assumption implies that |L\\Sg(Rd)| = \u221e. By setting A = B, it furthermore implies Sg(Rd) \u2286 L. Let us prefer objects with a small diameter over objects with a larger diameter. Then, obviously, {A,B} is a positive teaching set for LA,B . Because of |L \\ Sg(Rd)| = \u221e, L does clearly not satisfy the condition in Theorem 8, which is necessary for L to have a PBTD of 1. We may therefore conclude that PBTD(L) = PBTD+(L) = 2.\nThe family of classes with the required properties is rich and includes, for instance, the class of d-dimensional balls as well as the class of d-dimensional axis-parallel rectangles."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusions", "text": "Preference-based teaching uses the natural notion of preference relation to extend the classical teaching model. The resulting model is (i) more powerful than the classical one, (ii) resolves difficulties with the recursive teaching model in the case of infinite concept classes, and (iii) is at the same time free of coding tricks even according to\n9 This also follows from Lemma 5 and the fact that there are no chains of a length exceeding 2 in (L,\u227a).\nthe definition by [8]. Our examples of algebraic and geometric concept classes demonstrate that preference-based teaching can be achieved very efficiently with naturally defined teaching sets and based on intuitive preference relations such as inclusion. We believe that further studies of the PBTD will provide insights into structural properties of concept classes that render them easy or hard to learn in a variety of formal learning models.\nWe have shown that spanning sets lead to a general-purpose construction for preference-based teaching sets of only positive examples. While this result is fairly obvious, it provides further justification of the model of preference-based teaching, since the teaching sets it yields are often intuitively exactly those a teacher would choose in the classroom (for instance, one would represent convex polygons by their vertices, as in Example 3). It should be noted, too, that it can sometimes be difficult to establish whether the upper bound on PBTD obtained this way is tight, or whether the use of negative examples or preference relations other than inclusion yield smaller teaching sets. Generally, the choice of preference relation provides a degree of freedom that increases the power of the teacher but also increases the difficulty of establishing lower bounds on the number of examples required for teaching.\nAcknowledgements.

We furthermore assume that 0 is contained in every concept L \u2208 L. We can extend L to a larger class, namely the shift-extension L\u2032 of L, by allowing each of its concepts to be shifted by some constant which is taken from X :\nL\u2032 = {c+ L : (c \u2208 X ) \u2227 (L \u2208 L)} .\nThe next result states that this extension has little effect only on the complexity measures PBTD and PBTD+:\nLemma 18 (Shift Lemma). With the above notation and assumptions, the following holds:\nPBTD(L) \u2264 PBTD(L\u2032) \u2264 1+PBTD(L) and PBTD+(L) \u2264 PBTD+(L\u2032) \u2264 1+PBTD+(L) .\nProof. It suffices to verify the inequalities PBTD(L\u2032) \u2264 1+PBTD(L) and PBTD+ (L\u2032) \u2264 1 + PBTD+(L) because the other inequalities hold by virtue of monotonicity. Let T be an admissible mapping for L. It suffices to show that T can be transformed into an admissible mapping T \u2032 for L\u2032 such that ord(T \u2032) \u2264 1+ord(T ) and such that T \u2032 is positive provided that T is positive. To this end, we define T \u2032 as follows:\nT \u2032(c+ L) = {(c,+)} \u222a {(c+ x, b) : (x, b) \u2208 T (L)} .\nObviously ord(T \u2032) \u2264 1 + ord(T ). Note that c \u2208 c+ L because of our assumption that 0 is contained in every concept in L. Moreover, since the admissibility of T implies\nthat L is consistent with T (L), the above definition of T \u2032(c+L) makes sure that c+L is consistent with T \u2032(c + L). It suffices therefore to show that the relation trcl(RT \u2032) is asymmetric. Consider a pair (c\u2032 + L\u2032, c + L) \u2208 RT \u2032 . By the definition of RT \u2032 , it follows that c\u2032 + L\u2032 is consistent with T \u2032(c + L). Because of (c,+) \u2208 T \u2032(c + L), we must have c\u2032 \u2264 c. Suppose that c\u2032 = c. In this case, L\u2032 must be consistent with T (L). Thus L\u2032 \u227aT L. This reasoning implies that (c\u2032 + L\u2032, c+ L) \u2208 RT \u2032 can happen only if either c\u2032 < c or (c\u2032 = c) \u2227 (L\u2032 \u227aT L). Since \u227aT is asymmetric, we may now conclude that trcl(RT \u2032) is asymmetric, as desired.

We want to show that there is a preference relation for which k positive examples suffice to teach any concept in NE-LINSETk. To this end, let G = {g1, . . . , g\u2113} be a generator set with \u2113 \u2264 k where g1 < . . . < g\u2113. We use sum(G) = g1 + . . . + g\u2113 to denote the sum of all generators in G. We say that gi is a redundant generator in G if gi \u2208 \u2329 {g1, . . . , gi\u22121} \u232a .

Then G\u2217 is an independent subset of G generating the same linear set as G when allowing zero coefficients, i.e., we have \u3008G\u2217\u3009 = \u3008G\u3009 (although \u3008G\u2217\u3009+ 6= \u3008G\u3009+ whenever G\u2217 is a proper subset of G).\nTo define a suitable preference relation, let G, G\u0302 be generator sets of size k or less with tuple(G) = (g\u22171 , . . . , g \u2217 \u2113\u2217) and tuple(G\u0302) = (g\u0302 \u2217 1 , . . . , g\u0302 \u2217 \u2113\u0302\u2217 ). Let the student prefer G over G\u0302 if any of the following conditions is satisfied:\nCondition 1: sum(G) > sum(G\u0302). Condition 2: sum(G) = sum(G\u0302) and tuple(G) is lexicographically greater than\ntuple (G\u0302) without having tuple(G\u0302) as prefix. Condition 3: sum(G) = sum(G\u0302) and tuple(G) is a proper prefix of tuple(G\u0302).\nTo teach a concept \u3008G\u3009 \u2208 NE-LINSETk with sum(G) = g and tuple(G) = (g\u22171 , . . . , g \u2217 \u2113\u2217), one uses the teaching set\nS = {(g,+), (g + g\u22171 ,+), . . . , (g + g\u2217h\u2217 ,+)}\nwhere\nh = { \u2113\u2217 \u2212 1 if G\u2217 = G \u2113\u2217 if G\u2217 \u2282 G .

Clearly \u2329 G\u0302 \u232a satisfies sum(G\u0302) =\ng since\n\u2013 concepts with larger generator sums are inconsistent with (g,+), and \u2013 concepts with smaller generator sums have a lower preference (compare with Con-\ndition 1 above).\nIt follows that g + g\u2217i \u2208 \u2329 G\u0302 \u232a + is equivalent to g\u2217i \u2208 \u2329 G\u0302 \u232a = \u2329 G\u0302\u2217 \u232a . We conclude that the smallest generator in tuple(G\u0302) equals g\u22171 since\n\u2013 a smallest generator in tuple(G\u0302) that is greater than g\u22171 would cause an inconsistency with (g + g\u22171 ,+), and \u2013 a smallest generator in tuple(G\u0302) that is smaller than g\u22171 would have a lower preference (compare with Condition 2 above).\nAssume inductively that the i \u2212 1 smallest generators in tuple(G\u0302) are g\u22171 , . . . , g\u2217i\u22121. Since g\u2217i /\u2208 \u2329 {g\u22171 , . . . , g\u2217i\u22121} \u232a , we may apply a reasoning that is similar to the above reasoning concerning g\u22171 and conclude that the i\u2019th smallest generator in tuple(G\u0302) equals g\u2217i . The punchline of this discussion is that the sequence tuple(G\u0302) starts with g \u2217 1 , . . . , g \u2217 h with h given by (12).

We proceed by case analysis:\nCase 1: G\u2217 = G. Since G\u0302 is consistent with (g,+), we have \u2211 g\u2032\u2208G\u0302\u2032 g \u2032 = g\u2217\u2113\u2217 . Since g \u2217 \u2113\u2217 /\u2208 \u3008{g\u22171 , . . . ,\ng\u2217\u2113\u2217\u22121}\u3009, the set G\u0302\u2032 must contain an element that cannot be generated by g\u22171 , . . . , g\u2217\u2113\u2217\u22121. Given the preferences of the student (compare with Condition 2), she will\nchoose G\u0302\u2032 = {g\u2217\u2113\u2217}. It follows that G\u0302 = G. Case 2: G\u2217 \u2282 G.\nHere, we have \u2211\ng\u2032\u2208G\u0302\u2032 g \u2032 = \u2211 g\u2032\u2208G\u2032 g \u2032. Given the preferences of the student (com-\npare with Condition 3), she will choose G\u0302 such that G\u0302\u2217 = G\u2217 and G\u0302\u2032 consists of elements from \u3008G\u2217\u3009 that sum up to \u2211g\u2032\u2208G\u2032 g\u2032 (with G\u0302\u2032 = {\u2211 g\u2032\u2208G\u2032 g \u2032 } among the possible choices). Clearly, \u2329 G\u0302 \u232a + = \u3008G\u3009+.\nThus, in both cases, the student comes up with the right hypothesis."}, {"heading": "A.3 The Lower Bounds in Theorem 2", "text": "The lower bounds in Theorem 2 are an immediate consequence of the following result:\nLemma 20.

Note that the lower bound k\u2212 1 in (8) is immediate from (14) and a monotonicity argument. This is because NE-LINSET\u2032k \u2287 NE-CF-LINSET\u2032k as well as LINSET\u2032k \u2287 CF-LINSET\u2032k \u2287 NE-CF-LINSET\u2032k. Note furthermore that PBTD+ (CF-LINSET\u2032k) \u2265 k+1 because of (13) and a monotonicity argument. Then the Shift Lemma implies that PBTD+(CF-LINSETk) \u2265 k. Similarly, PBTD+(NE-LINSETk ) \u2265 k\u2212 1 follows from (17) and a monotonicity argument. All remaining lower bounds in Theorem 2 are obtained from these observations by virtue of monotonicity.\nThe proof of Theorem 2 can therefore be accomplished by proving Lemma 20. It turns out that the proof of this lemma is quite involved. We will present in Section A.3 some theoretical prerequisites. Sections A.3 and A.3 are devoted to the actual proof of the lemma.\nSome Basic Concepts in the Theory of Numerical Semigroups Recall from Section 6 that \u3008G\u3009 = {\u2211 g\u2208G a(g)g : a(g) \u2208 N0 } . The elements of G are called generators of \u3008G\u3009. A set P \u2282 N is said to be independent if none of the elements in P can be written as a linear combination (with coefficients from N0) of the remaining elements (so that\u2329 P \u2032 \u232a is a proper subset of \u3008P \u3009 for every proper subset P \u2032 of P ). It is well known [14] that independence makes generating systems unique, i.e., if P, P \u2032 are independent, then \u3008P \u3009 = \u2329 P \u2032 \u232a implies that P = P \u2032. Moreover, for every independent set P , the following\nimplication is valid:\n(S \u2286 \u3008P \u3009 \u2227 P 6\u2286 S) \u21d2 (\u3008S\u3009 \u2282 \u3008P \u3009) . (18)\nLet P = {a1, . . . , ak} be independent with a1 = minP . It is well known10 and easy to see that the residues of a1, a2, . . . , ak modulo a1 must be pairwise distinct\n10 E.g., see [14]\n(because, otherwise, we would obtain a dependence). If a1 is a prime and |P | \u2265 2, then the independence of P implies that gcd(P ) = 1. Thus the following holds:\nLemma 21. If P \u2282 N is an independent set of cardinality at least 2 and minP is a prime, then gcd(P ) = 1.\nIn the remainder of the paper, the symbols P and P \u2032 are reserved for denoting independent sets of generators.\nIt is well known that \u3008G\u3009 is co-finite iff gcd(G) = 1 [14]. Let P be a finite (independent) subset of N such that gcd(P ) = 1. The largest number in N \\ \u3008P \u3009 is called the Frobenius number of P and is denoted as F (P ). It is well known [14] that\nF ({p, q}) = pq \u2212 p\u2212 q (19)\nprovided that p, q \u2265 2 satisfy gcd(p, q) = 1.\nProof of (13) The shift-extension of NE-CF-LINSETk is (by way of definition) the following class:\nNE-CF-LINSET\u2032k = {c+\u3008P \u3009+ : (c \u2208 N0)\u2227(P \u2282 N)\u2227(|P | \u2264 k)\u2227(gcd(P ) = 1)} . (20)\nIt is easy to see that this can be written alternatively in the form\nNE-CF-LINSET\u2032k =   N + \u3008P \u3009 : N \u2208 N0 \u2227 P \u2282 N \u2227 |P | \u2264 k \u2227 gcd(P ) = 1 \u2227 \u2211\np\u2208P\np \u2264 N   \n(21) where N in (21) corresponds to c+ \u2211 p\u2208P p in (20).\nFor technical reasons, we define the following subfamilies of NE-CF-LINSET\u2032k. For each N \u2265 0, let\nNE-CF-LINSET\u2032k[N ] = {N + L : L \u2208 LINSETk[N ]}\nwhere\nLINSETk[N ] =   \u3008P \u3009 \u2208 LINSETk : (gcd(P ) = 1) \u2227   \u2211\np\u2208P\np \u2264 N      .\nIn other words, NE-CF-LINSET\u2032k[N ] is the subclass consisting of all concepts in NE-CF-LINSET\u2032k (written in the form (21)) whose constant is N . A central notion for proving (13) is the following one:\nDefinition 5. Let k,N \u2265 2 be integers. We say that a set L \u2208 NE-CF-LINSET\u2032 is (k,N)-special if it is of the form L = N + \u3008P \u3009 such that the following holds:\n1. P is an independent set of cardinality k and minP is a prime (so that gcd(P ) = 1 according to Lemma 21, which furthermore implies that \u3008P \u3009 is co-finite).\n2. Let q(P ) denote the smallest prime that is greater than F (P ) and greater than maxP . For a = minP and r = 0, . . . , a\u2212 1, let\ntr(P ) = min{s \u2208 \u3008P \u3009 : s \u2261 r (mod a)} and tmax(P ) = max 0\u2264r\u2264a\u22121 tr(P ) ."}, {"heading": "Then", "text": "N \u2265 k(a+ tmax(P )) and N \u2265 q(P ) + \u2211\np\u2208P\\{a}\np . (22)\nWe need at least k positive examples in order to distinguish a (k,N)-special set from all its proper subsets in NE-CF-LINSET\u2032k[N ], as the following result shows:\nLemma 22. For all k \u2265 2, the following holds. If L \u2208 NE-CF-LINSET\u2032 is (k,N)special, then L \u2208 NE-CF-LINSET\u2032[N ] and I \u2032(L,NE-CF-LINSETk[N ]) \u2265 k.\nProof. Suppose that L = N + \u3008P \u3009 is of the form as described in Definition 5. Let P = {a, a2 . . . , ak} with a = minP . For the sake of simplicity, we will write tr instead of tr(P ) and tmax instead of tmax(P ). The independence of P implies that tai mod a = ai for i = 2, . . . , k. It follows that tmax \u2265 maxP . Since, by assumption, N \u2265 k \u00b7 tmax, it becomes obvious that L \u2208 NE-CF-LINSET\u2032[N ].\nAssume by way of contradiction that the following holds:\n(A) There is a weak spanning set S of size k \u2212 1 for L w.r.t. NE-CF-LINSET\u2032k[N ].\nSince N is contained in any concept from NE-CF-LINSET\u2032k[N ], we may assume that N /\u2208 S so that S is of the form S = {N + x1, . . . , N + xk\u22121} for integers xi \u2265 1. For i = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1, let ri = xi mod a \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , a \u2212 1}. It follows that each xi is of the form xi = qia+ tri for some integer qi \u2265 0. Let X = {x1, . . . , xk\u22121}. We proceed by case analysis:\nCase 1: X \u2286 {a2, . . . , ak} (so that, in view of |X | = k \u2212 1, we even have X = {a2, . . . , ak}). Let L\u2032 = N + \u3008X\u3009. Then S \u2286 L\u2032. Note that X \u2286 P but P 6\u2286 X . We may conclude from (18) that \u3008X\u3009 \u2282 \u3008P \u3009 and, therefore, L\u2032 \u2282 L. Thus L\u2032 is a proper subset of L which contains S. Note that (22) implies that N \u2265 \u2211ki=2 ai = \u2211k\u22121 i=1 xi. If\ngcd(X) = 1, then L\u2032 \u2208 NE-CF-LINSET[N ] and we have an immediate contradiction to the above assumption (A). Otherwise, if gcd(X) \u2265 2, then we define L\u2032\u2032 = N + \u2329 X \u222a {q(P )} \u232a . Note that S \u2286 L\u2032 \u2286 L\u2032\u2032. Since q(P ) > F (P ), we have X \u222a {q(P )} \u2286 \u3008P \u3009 and, since q(P ) > maxP , we have P 6\u2286 X \u222a {q(P )}. We may conclude from (18) that \u2329 X \u222a {q(P )} \u232a \u2282 \u3008P \u3009 and, therefore, L\u2032\u2032 \u2282 L. Thus, L\u2032\u2032 is a proper subset of L which contains S. Because X = {a2, . . . , ak} and q(P ) is a prime that is greater than maxP , it follows that gcd(X \u222a {q(P )}) = 1. In combination with (22), it easily follows now that L\u2032\u2032 \u2208 NE-CF-LINSET[N ]. Putting everything together, we arrive at a contradiction to the assumption (A). Case 2: X 6\u2286 {a2, . . . , ak}. If ri = 0 for i = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1, then each xi is a multiple of a. In this case, N +\u2329 a, q(P ) \u232a is a proper subset of L = N+\u3008P \u3009 that is consistent with S, which yields\na contradiction. We may therefore assume that there exists i\u2032 \u2208 {1, . . . , k\u22121} such\nthat ri\u2032 6= 0. From the case assumption, X 6\u2286 {a2, . . . , ak}, it follows that there must exist an index i\u2032\u2032 \u2208 {1, . . . , k \u2212 1} such that qi\u2032\u2032 \u2265 1 or tr i\u2032\u2032 /\u2208 {a2, . . . , ak}. For i = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1, let q\u2032i = min{qi, 1} and x\u2032i = q\u2032ia + tri . Note that q\u2032i\u2032\u2032 = 1 iff qi\u2032\u2032 \u2265 1. Define L\u2032\u2032 = N + \u2329 X \u2032 \u232a for X \u2032 = {a, x\u20321, . . . , x\u2032k\u22121} and observe the following. First, the set L\u2032\u2032 clearly contains S. Second, the choice of x\u20321, . . . , x \u2032 k\u22121 implies that X \u2032 \u2286 \u3008P \u3009. Third, it easily follows from q\u2032i\u2032\u2032 = 1 or tri\u2032\u2032 /\u2208 {a2, . . . , ak} that P 6\u2286 {a, x\u20321, . . . , x\u2032k\u22121}. We may conclude from (18) that \u2329 X \u2032 \u232a \u2282 \u3008P \u3009 and, therefore,L\u2032\u2032 \u2282 L. Thus,L\u2032\u2032 is a proper subset of Lwhich containsS. Since ri\u2032 6= 0 and a is a prime, it follows that gcd(a, x\u2032i\u2032 ) = 1 and, therefore, gcd(X\n\u2032) = 1. In combination with (22), it easily follows now that L\u2032\u2032 \u2208 NE-CF-LINSET[N ]. Putting everything together, we obtain again a contradiction to the assumption (A).\nFor the sake of brevity, let L = NE-CF-LINSET\u2032. Assume by way of contradiction that there exists a positive mapping T of order k that is admissible for Lk. We will pursue the following strategy:\n1. We define a set L \u2208 Lk of the form L = N + p+ \u30081\u3009. 2. We define a second set L\u2032 = N + \u3008G\u3009 \u2208 L that is (k,N)-special and consistent\nwith T+(L). Moreover, L\u2032 \\ L = {N}.\nIf this can be achieved, then the proof will be accomplished as follows:\n\u2013 According to Lemma 22, T+(L\u2032) must contain at least k examples (all of which are different from N ) for distinguishing L\u2032 from all its proper subsets in Lk[N ]. \u2013 Since L\u2032 is consistent with T+(L), the set T+(L\u2032) must contain an example which distinguishes L\u2032 from L. But the only example which fits this purpose is (N,+). \u2013 The discussion shows that T+(L\u2032) must contain k examples in order to distinguish L\u2032 from all its proper subsets in Lk plus one additional example, N , needed to distinguish L\u2032 from L. \u2013 We obtain a contradiction to our initial assumption that T+ is of order k.\nWe still have to describe how our proof strategy can actually be implemented. We start with the definition of L. Pick the smallest prime p \u2265 k+1. Then {p, p+1, . . . , p+ k} is independent. Let M = F ({p, p+1}) (19)= p(p+1)\u2212p\u2212(p+1). An easy calculation shows that k \u2265 2 and p \u2265 k + 1 imply that M \u2265 p + k. Let I = {p, p+ 1, . . . ,M}. Choose N large enough so that all concepts of the form\nN + \u3008P \u3009 where |P | = k, p = minP and P \u2286 I\nare (k,N)-special. With these choices of p and N , let L = N + p + \u30081\u3009. Note that N+p,N+p+1 \u2208 T+(L) because, otherwise, one of the concepts N+p+1+\u30081\u3009, N+ p + \u30082, 3\u3009 \u2282 L would be consistent with T+(L) whereas T+(L) must distinguish L from all its proper subsets in Lk. Setting A = {x : N + x \u2208 T+(L)}, it follows that |A| = |T+(L)| \u2264 k and p, p + 1 \u2208 A. The set A is not necessarily independent but it contains an independent subset B such that p, p + 1 \u2208 B and \u3008A\u3009 = \u3008B\u3009. Since M = F ({p, p+1}), it follows that any integer greater thanM is contained in \u3008p, p+ 1\u3009. Since B is an independent extension of {p, p+1}, it cannot contain any integer greater\nthan M . It follows that B \u2286 I . Clearly, |B| \u2264 k and gcd(B) = 1. We would like to transform B into another generating system G \u2286 I such that\n\u3008B\u3009 \u2286 \u3008G\u3009, gcd(G) = 1 and |G| = k .\nIf |B| = k, we can simply set G = B. If |B| < k, then we make use of the elements in the independent set {p, p + 1, . . . , p + k} \u2286 I and add them, one after the other, to B (thereby removing other elements from B whenever their removal leaves \u3008B\u3009 invariant) until the resulting set G contains k elements. We now define the set L\u2032 by setting L\u2032 = N + \u3008G\u3009. Since G \u2286 I = {p, p+1, . . . ,M}, and p, p+1 \u2208 G, it follows that p = minG, gcd(G) = 1 and min(L\u2032 \\ {N}) is N + p. Thus, L\u2032 \\ L = {N}, as desired. Moreover, since N had been chosen large enough, the set L\u2032 is (k,N)-special. Thus L and L\u2032 have all properties that are required by our proof strategy and the proof of (13) is complete.\nProof of (14), (15), (16) and (17) We make use of some well known (and trivial) lower bounds on TDmin:\nExample 5. For every k \u2208 N, let [k] = {1, 2, . . . , k}, let 2[k] denote the powerset of [k] and, for all \u2113 = 0, 1, . . . , k, let\n( [k]\n\u2113\n) = {S \u2286 [k] : |S| = \u2113}\ndenote the class of those subsets of [k] that have exactly \u2113 elements. It is trivial to verify that\nTDmin\n( 2[k] ) = k and TDmin\n(( [k]\n\u2113\n)) = min{\u2113, k \u2212 \u2113} .\nIn view of PBTD+(LINSETk) = k, the next results show that negative examples are of limited help only as far as preference-based teaching of concepts from LINSETk is concerned:\nLemma 23. For every k \u2265 1 and for all \u2113 = 0, . . . , k \u2212 1, let\nLk = {\u3008k, p1, . . . , pk\u22121\u3009 : pi \u2208 {k + i, 2k + i}} , Lk,\u2113 = {{\u3008k, p1, . . . , pk\u22121\u3009 \u2208 Lk : |{i : pi = k + i}| = \u2113} .\nWith this notation, the following holds:\nTDmin(Lk) \u2265 k \u2212 1 and TDmin(Lk,\u2113) \u2265 min{\u2113, k \u2212 1\u2212 \u2113} .\nProof. For k = 1, the assertion in the lemma is vacuous. Suppose therefore that k \u2265 2. An inspection of the generators k, p1, . . . , pk\u22121 with pi \u2208 {k + i, 2k + i} shows that\nLk = {Lk,S : S \u2286 {k + 1, k + 2, . . . , 2k \u2212 1}} Lk,\u2113 = {Lk,S : (S \u2286 {k + 1, k + 2, . . . , 2k \u2212 1}) \u2227 (|S| = \u2113)}\nwhere Lk,S = {0, k} \u222a {2k, 2k+ 1, . . .} \u222a S .\nNote that the examples in {0, 1, . . . , k} \u222a {2k, 2k + 1, . . . , } are redundant because they do not distinguish between distinct concepts from Lk. The only useful examples are therefore contained in the interval {k + 1, k + 2, . . . , 2k \u2212 1}. From this discussion, it follows that teaching the concepts of Lk (resp. of Lk,\u2113) is not essentially different from teaching the concepts of 2[k\u22121] ( resp. of ( [k\u22121]\n\u2113\n)) . This completes the proof\nof the lemma because we know from Example 5 that TDmin(2[k\u22121]) = k \u2212 1 and TDmin (( [k\u22121]\n\u2113\n)) = min{\u2113, k \u2212 1\u2212 \u2113}.\nWe claim now that the inequalities (14), (15) and (16) are valid, i.e., we claim that the following holds:\n1. PBTD(CF-LINSETk) \u2265 k \u2212 1. 2. PBTD(NE-CF-LINSETk) \u2265 \u230a(k \u2212 1)/2\u230b. 3. PBTD(NE-CF-LINSET\u2032k) \u2265 k \u2212 1.\nProof. For k = 1, the inequalities are obviously valid. Suppose therefore that k \u2265 2. 1. Since gcd(k, k + 1) = gcd(k, 2k + 1) = 1, it follows that Lk is a finite subclass\nof CF-LINSETk. Thus PBTD(CF-LINSETk) \u2265 PBTD(Lk) \u2265 TDmin(Lk) \u2265 k \u2212 1. 2. Define Lk[N ] = {N +L : L \u2208 Lk} and Lk,\u2113[N ] = {N +L : L \u2208 Lk,\u2113}. Clearly TDmin(Lk[N ]) = TDmin(Lk) and TDmin(Lk,\u2113[N ]) = TDmin(Lk,\u2113) holds for every N \u2265 0. It follows that the lower bounds in Lemma 23 are also valid for the classes Lk[N ] and Lk,\u2113[N ] in place of Lk and Lk,\u2113, respectively. Let\nN(k) = k2+(k\u22121\u2212\u230a(k\u22121)/2\u230b)k+ k\u22121\u2211\ni=1\ni = k2+(k\u22121\u2212\u230a(k\u22121)/2\u230b)k+1 2 (k\u22121)k .\n(23) It suffices to show that N(k)+Lk,\u230a(k\u22121)/2\u230b is a finite subclass ofNE-CF-LINSETk. To this end, first note that\n\u3008k, p1, . . . , pk\u22121\u3009+ = k + k\u22121\u2211\ni=1\npi + \u3008k, p1, . . . , pk\u22121\u3009 .\nCall pi \u201clight\u201d if pi = k + i and call it \u201cheavy\u201d if pi = 2k + i. Note that a concept L from N(k) + Lk,\u2113 is of the general form\nL = N(k) + \u3008k, p1, . . . , pk\u22121\u3009 (24)\nwith exactly \u2113 light parameters among p1, . . . , pk\u22121. A straightforward calculation shows that, for \u2113 = \u230a(k \u2212 1)/2\u230b, the sum k + \u2211k\u22121i=1 pi equals the number N(k) as defined in (23). Thus, the concept L from (24) with exactly \u230a(k \u2212 1)/2\u230b light parameters among {p1, . . . , pk\u22121} can be rewritten as follows:\nL = N(k) + \u3008k, p1, . . . , pk\u22121\u3009 = \u3008k, p1, . . . , pk\u22121\u3009+ .\nThis shows that L \u2208 NE-CF-LINSETk. As L is a concept from N(k)+ Lk,\u230a(k\u22121)/2\u230b in general form, we may conclude that N(k)+Lk,\u230a(k\u22121)/2\u230b is a finite subclass of NE-CF-LINSETk, as desired. 3. The proof of the third inequality is similar to the above proof of the second one. It suffices to show that, for every k \u2265 2, there exists N \u2208 N such that N + Lk is a subclass of NE-CF-LINSET\u2032k. To this end, we set N = 3k\n2. A concept L from 3k2 + Lk is of the general form\nL = 3k2 + \u3008k, p1, . . . , pk\u22121\u3009\nwith pi \u2208 {k+ i, 2k+ i} (but without control over the number of light parameters). It is easy to see that the constant 3k2 is large enough so that L can be rewritten as\nL = 3k2 \u2212  k + k\u22121\u2211\ni=1\npi  + \u3008k, p1, . . . , pk\u22121\u3009+\nwhere 3k2 \u2212 ( k + \u2211k\u22121 i=1 pi ) \u2265 0. This shows that L \u2208 NE-CF-LINSET\u2032k. As L is a concept from 3k2 + Lk in general form, we may conclude that 3k2 + Lk is a finite subclass of NE-CF-LINSET\u2032k, as desired.\nWe conclude with the proof of the inequality (17).\nLemma 24. PBTD+(NE-LINSETk) \u2265 PBTD+(NE-CF-LINSETk) \u2265 k \u2212 1.\nProof. The class NE-CF-LINSET1 contains onlyN, and soPBTD +(NE-CF-LINSET1) = 0. The class NE-CF-LINSET2 contains at least two members so that PBTD + (NE-CF-LINSET2) \u2265 1. Now assume k \u2265 3. Set\nN =\nk\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n(k + i)\nand\nL = \u3008k, k + 1, . . . , 2k \u2212 1\u3009+ = N+\u3008k, k + 1, . . . , 2k \u2212 1\u3009 = {N}\u222a{N+k,N+k+1, . . .} .\nChoose and fix an arbitrary set S \u2286 L of size k \u2212 2. It suffices to show S is not a weak spanning set for L w.r.t. NE-CF-LINSETk. If S does not contain N , then the set\nL\u2032 = \u3008N + k \u2212 1, 1\u3009+ = L \\ {N}\nsatisfies S \u2282 L\u2032 \u2282 L so that S cannot be a weak spanning set for L. Suppose therefore from now on that N \u2208 S. We proceed by case analysis:\nCase 1: k = 3. Then N = 12, L = 12+ \u30083, 4, 5\u3009 = {12}\u222a {15, 16, 17, . . .}. Moreover |S| = 1 so that S = {12}. Now the set L\u2032 = \u30085, 7\u3009+ = 12 + \u30085, 7\u3009 satisfies S \u2282 L\u2032 \u2282 L so that S cannot be a weak spanning set for L.\nCase 2: k = 4. Then N = 22, L = 22 + \u30084, 5, 6, 7\u3009 = {22} \u222a {26, 27, 28, . . .}. Moreover |S| = 2 so that S = {22} \u222a {26+ x} for some x \u2265 0. Let a = (x mod 4) \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3}. It is easy to check that the set\nL\u2032 =    22 + \u30084, 5, 13\u3009 if a \u2208 {0, 1} 22 + \u30084, 7, 11\u3009 if a = 3 22 + \u30085, 6, 11\u3009 if x = a = 2 22 + \u30084, 5, 13\u3009 if x > a = 2\nsatisfies S \u2282 L\u2032 \u2282 L so that S cannot be a weak spanning set for L.
