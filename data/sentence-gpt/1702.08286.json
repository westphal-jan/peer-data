The price of fairness measures the worst-case loss of economic efficiency when using an inefficient but fair allocation rule; for indivisible goods in many settings, this price is unacceptably high. In this work, we propose a hybrid fairness rule that balances a strict lexicographic preference ordering over classes of agents and a utilitarian objective that maximizes economic efficiency.\n\n\n\n\nThe system was devised to prevent the \"competition\" of economic efficiency through allocation, or allocation, among all the services offered in the marketplace. It has since been implemented on both sides of the political divide. We propose a new mechanism for eliminating competition and minimizing competition among agents and agents (see the chapter for more information). The new mechanism is to minimize competition among agents and agents by reducing the efficiency of agents, and also increasing efficiency with competition.\n\nThe optimal allocation scheme is an alternative, more flexible and efficient approach to maximizing the efficiency of agents and agents. It also eliminates competition among agents and agents by simplifying its scope and design of a hierarchy of agents.\nIn the United States, agents often choose between the best-case and the worst-case allocation scheme, and for many cases, the allocation of agents by the best-case allocation scheme is more efficient and efficient than the allocation of agents by the best-case allocation scheme. For example, for instance, in a case involving a client who makes the most money when he has a better case of better quality, the allocation of agents by the worst-case allocation scheme is more efficient and more efficient. These two proposals would reduce the overall allocation of agents by twofold, and prevent the allocation of agents by threefold. The new system would eliminate competition for these agents, but reduces competition among agents by a few percentage points and eliminate competition by a few percentage points.\nIn the United States, agents often choose between the best-case and the worst-case allocation scheme, and for many cases, the allocation of agents by the best-case allocation scheme is more efficient and efficient.\nThe optimal allocation scheme is an alternative, more flexible and efficient approach to maximizing the efficiency of agents and agents.

Left untreated, it leads to end-stage renal failure and the need for a donor kidney\u2014for which demand far outstrips supply. In the United States alone, the kidney transplant waiting list grew from 58,000 people in 2004 to over 100,000 needy patients (Hart et al. 2016).1\nTo alleviate some of this supply-demand mismatch, kidney exchanges (Rapaport 1986; Roth et al. 2004) allow patients with willing living donors to trade donors for access to compatible or higher-quality organs. In addition to these patient-donor pairs, modern exchanges include non-directed donors, who enter the exchange without a patient in need of a kidney. Exchanges occur in cycle- or chain-like structures, and now account for 10% of living transplants in the United States. Yet, access to a kidney exchange does not guarantee equal access to kidneys themselves; for example, certain classes of patients may be particularly disadvantaged based on health characteristics or other logistical factors. Thus, fairness considerations are an active topic of theoretical and\n1 https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/converge/data/\npractical research in kidney exchange and the matching market community in general.\nIntuitively, any enforcement of a fairness constraint or consideration may have a negative effect on overall economic efficiency. A quantification of this tradeoff is known as the price of fairness (Bertsimas et al. 2011). Recent work by Dickerson et al. (2014) adapted this concept to the kidney exchange case, and presented two fair allocation rules that strike a balance between fairness and efficiency. Yet, as we show in this paper, those rules can \u201cfail\u201d unpredictably, yielding an arbitrarily high price of fairness.\nWith this as motivation, we adapt to the kidney exchange case a recent technique for trading off a form of fairness and utilitarianism in a principled manner. This technique is parameterized by a bound on the price of fairness, as opposed to a set of parameters that may result in hard-to-predict final matching behavior, as in past work. We implement our rule in a realistic mathematical programming framework and\u2013on real data from a large, multi-center, fielded kidney exchange\u2013show that our rule effectively balances fairness and efficiency without unwanted outlier behavior."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related Work", "text": "We briefly overview related work in balancing efficiency and fairness in resource allocation problem. Bertsimas et al. (2011) define the price of fairness; that is, the relative loss in system efficiency under a fair allocation rule. Hooker and Williams (2012) give a formal method for combining utilitarianism and equity. We direct the reader to those two papers for a greater overview of research in fairness in general resource allocation problems.\nFairness in the context of kidney exchange was first studied by Roth et al. (2005b); they explore concepts like Lorenz dominance in a stylized model, and show that preferring fair allocations can come at great cost. Li et al. (2014) extend this model and present an algorithm to solve for a Lorenz dominant matching. Stability in kidney exchange, a concept intimately related to fairness, was explored by Liu et al. (2014). The use of randomized allocation machanisms to promote fairness in stylized models is theoretically promising (Fang et al. 2015; Aziz et al. 2016; Mattei et al. 2017). Recent work discusses fairness in stylized random graph models of dynamic kidney exchange (Ashlagi et al. 2013; Anderson et al. 2015).

Dickerson et al. (2014) introduced two fairness rules explicitly in the context of kidney exchange, and proved bounds on the price of fairness under those rules in a random graph model; we build on that work in this paper, and describe it in greater detail later. That work has been incorporated into a framework for learning to balance efficiency, fairness, and dynamism in matching markets (Dickerson and Sandholm 2015); we note that the fairness rule we present in this paper could be used in that framework as well."}, {"heading": "1.2 Our Contributions", "text": "Dickerson et al. (2014) finds that the theoretical price of fairness in kidney exchange is small when only patient-donor pairs participate in the exchange. They did not include nondirected donors (NDDs). However, in modern kidney exchanges, non-directed donors (NDDs) provide many more matches than patient-donor pairs; furthermore, NDDs create more opportunities to expand the fair matching, potentially increasing the price of fairness. Here, we prove that adding NDDs to the theoretical model actually decreases the price of fairness, and that\u2014with enough NDDs\u2014the price of fairness is zero.\nReal kidney exchanges are less dense and more uncertain than the (standard) theoretical model in which we prove our results. Previous approaches to incorporating fairness into kidney exchange have neglected this fact: they have been either ad-hoc\u2014e.g., \u201cpriority points\u201d decided on by committee (Kidney Paired Donation Work Group 2013)\u2014or brittle (Roth et al. 2005b; Dickerson et al. 2014), resulting in an unacceptably high price of fairness. This paper provides the first approach to incorporating fairness into kidney exchange in a way that both prioritizes disadvantaged participants, but also comes with acceptable worst-case guarantees on the price of fairness. Our method is easily applied as an objective in the mathematical-programming-based clearing methods used in today\u2019s fielded exchanges; indeed, using real data we show that this method guarantees a limit on efficiency loss.\nSection 1.3 introduces the kidney exchange problem. Section 2 extends work by Ashlagi and Roth (2014) and Dickerson et al. (2014), showing that the price of fairness is small on the canonical random graph model even with NDDs. Section 3 shows that two recent fair allocation rules from the kidney exchange literature (Dickerson et al. 2014) can perform unacceptably poorly in the worst case. Then, Section 4 presents a new allocation rule that allows policymakers to set a limit on efficiency loss, while also favoring disadvantaged patients. Section 5 shows on real data from a large fielded kidney exchange that our method limits efficiency loss while still favoring disadvantaged patients when possible."}, {"heading": "1.3 Preliminaries", "text": "A kidney exchange can be represented as a directed compatibility graphG = (V,E), with vertices V = P\u222aN including both patient donor pairs p \u2208 P and non-directed-donors n \u2208 N (Roth et al. 2004; Roth et al. 2005a; Roth et al. 2005b; Abraham et al. 2007). A directed edge e is drawn from vertex vi to vj if the donor at vi can give to the patient at vj . Fielded kidney exchanges consist mainly of directed cycles in G, where each patient vertex in the cycle receives the donor kidney of the previous vertex. Modern exchanges also include non-cyclic structures called chains (Montgomery et al. 2006; Rees et al. 2009). Here, an NDD donates her kidney to a patient, whose paired donor donates her kidney to another patient, and so on.\nIn practice, cycles are limited in size, or \u201ccapped,\u201d to some small constant L, while chains are limited in size to a much larger constant R\u2014or not limited at all. This is because all transplants in a cycle must execute simultaneously; if a donor whose paired patient had already received a kidney backed out of the donation, then some participant in the market would be strictly worse off than before. However, chains need not be executed simultaneously; if a donor backs out after her paired patient receives a kidney, then the chain breaks but no participant is strictly worse off. We will discuss how these caps affect fairness and efficiency in the coming sections.\nThe goal of kidney exchange programs is to find a matching M\u2014a collection of disjoint cycles and chains in the graph G. The cycles and chains must be disjoint because no donor can give more than one of her kidneys (although ongoing work explores multi-donor kidney exchange (Ergin et al. 2017; Farina et al. 2017)). The clearing problem in kidney exchange is to find a matching M\u2217 that maximizes some utility function u : M \u2192 R, where M is the set of all legal matchings. Real kidney exchanges typically optimize for the maximum weighted cycle cover (i.e., u(M) = \u2211 c\u2208M \u2211 e\u2208c we). This utilitarian objective can favor certain classes of patient-donor pairs while disadvantaging others. This is formalized in the following section."}, {"heading": "1.4 The Price of Fairness", "text": "As an example for this paper, we focus on highly-sensitized patients, who have a very low probability of their blood passing a feasibility test with a random donor organ; thus, finding a kidney is often quite hard, and their median waiting time for an organ jumps by a factor of three over less sensitized patients.2 Utilitarian objectives will, in general, marginalize these patients. Sensitization is determined using the Calculated Panel Reactive Antibody (CPRA) level of each patient, which reflects the likelihood that a patient will find a matching donor.\nFormally the sensitization of each patient-donor vertex v be vs \u2208 [0, 100], the CPRA level of v\u2019s patient; NDD vertices are not associated with patients, so they do not have sensitization levels. Each patient-donor vertex v \u2208 P is considered highly sensitized if vs exceeds threshold \u03c4 \u2208\n2https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/\n[0, 100], and lowly-sensitized otherwise. These vertex sets VH and VL are defined as: \u2022 Lowly sensitized: VL = {v | v \u2208 P : vs < \u03c4} \u2022 Highly sensitized: VH = {v | v \u2208 P : vs \u2265 \u03c4}. By definition, highly-sensitized patients are harder to match than lowly-sensitized patients. Naturally, efficient matching algorithms prioritize easy-to-match vertices in VL, marginalizing VH . Let uf : M \u2192 R be a fair utility function. Formally, a utility function is fair when its corresponding optimal match M\u2217f is viewed as fair, where M \u2217 f is defined as:\nM\u2217f = arg max M\u2208M uf (M)\nBertsimas et al.

(2009) defined an essentially identical concept in parallel. Formally, given a fair utility function uf and the utilitarian utility function u, the price of fairness is:\nPOF(M, uf ) = u (M\u2217)\u2212 u\n( M\u2217f ) u (M\u2217)\n(1)\nThe price of fairness POF(M, uf ) is the relative loss in (utilitarian) efficiency caused by choosing the fair outcome M\u2217f rather than the most efficient outcome.\nIn the next section we show that the theoretical price of fairness in kidney exchange is small, even when both cycles and chains are used\u2014thus generalizing an earlier result due to Dickerson et al. (2014) to modern kidney exchanges."}, {"heading": "2 The Theoretical Price of Fairness with Chains is Low (or Zero)", "text": "In this section we use the random graph model for kidney exchange introduced by Ashlagi and Roth (2014) to show that the theoretical price of fairness is always small, especially when NDDs are included. A complete description of this model can be found in Appendix A.1. Dickerson et al. (2014) finds that without NDDs, the maximum price of fairness is 2/33. Adding NDDs to this model creates more opportunities to match highly sensitized patients, which could potentially lead to a higher price of fairness. However we find that including chains in this model only decreases the price of fairness; furthermore, when the ratio of NDDs to patient-donor pairs is high enough, the price of fairness is zero."}, {"heading": "2.1 Price of Fairness", "text": "Ashlagi and Roth (2014) characterize efficient matchings in a random graph model without chains, and Dickerson et al. (2014) build on this to show that the price of fairness without chains is bounded above by 2/33. Dickerson et al. (2012) extend the efficient matching of Ashlagi and Roth (2014) to include chains, but do not calculate the price of fairness. In this work, we close the remaining gap in theory regarding the price of fairness with chains.\nGiven |P | patient-donor pairs, we parameterize the number of NDDs |N | with \u03b2 \u2265 0 such that |N | = \u03b2|P |. Theorems 1 and 2 state our two main results: adding chains to the random graph model does not increase the price of fairness, and when the fraction of NDDs is high enough (\u03b2 > 1/8), the price of fairness is zero. The proofs of the following theorems are given in Appendix A. Theorem 1. Adding NDDs to the random graph model (\u03b2 > 0) does not increase the upper bound on the price of fairness found by Dickerson et al. (2014).\nProof Sketch: We explore every possible efficient matching on the random graph model with chains; only four of these matchings have nonzero price of fairness. For each case, we compare the price of fairness to that of the efficient matching without chains found in Dickerson et al. (2014), and find that the upper bound does not increase. Theorem 2. The price of fairness is zero when \u03b2 > 1/8.\nProof sketch: For each matching with nonzero price of fairness, \u03b2 \u2264 1/8. When \u03b2 > 1/8, a different matching occurs, and the price of fairness is zero.\nTo illustrate these results, we compute the price of fairness when \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1/8]. These calculations confirm our theoretical results, as shown in Figure 2.1: the price of fairness decreases as \u03b2 increases, and is zero when \u03b2 > 1/8.\nThe worst-case price of fairness is small in the random graph model, with or without NDDs. However, real exchange graphs are typically much sparser and less uniform\u2014in reality the price of fairness can be high. In the next section, we discuss two notions of fairness in kidney exchange and determine their worst-case price of fairness.\n3 The Price of Fairness in State-of-the-Art Fair Rules can be Arbitrarily Bad\nThe price of fairness depends on how fairness is defined. This is especially true in real exchanges where the price of fairness can be unacceptably high.\nIn this section, we discuss two kidney-exchange-specific fairness rules introduced by Dickerson et al. (2014): lexicographic fairness and weighted fairness. These rules favor the disadvantaged class, or classes, without considering overall\nloss in efficiency; we will show in the worst case these rules allow the the price of fairness to approach 1 (i.e., total efficiency loss). Proofs of these theorems are in Appendix B."}, {"heading": "3.1 Lexicographic Fairness", "text": "As proposed by Dickerson et al. (2014), \u03b1-lexicographic fairness assigns nonzero utility only to matchings that award at least a fraction \u03b1 of the maximum possible fair utility. Letting uH(M) and uL(M) be the utility assigned to only vertices in VH and VL, respectively, the utility function for \u03b1-lexicographic fairness is given in Equation (2).\nu\u03b1(M) =  uL(M) + uH(M) if uH(M) \u2265 \u03b1 max M\u2032\u2208M uH(M \u2032) 0 otherwise.

Theorem 5. For any cycle cap L and \u03b3 \u2265 L\u22121, there exists a graph G such that the price of fairness of G under the weighted fairness rule is bounded by POF(M, uWF ) \u2265 L\u22122L .

The price of fairness also approaches 1 as \u03b3 increases. Theorem 7. With no chain cap, there exists a graph G such that the price of fairness of G under the weighted fairness rule is bounded by POF(M, uWF ) \u2265 \u03b3\u03b3+1 .\nA similar result exists with cycles rather than chains.\nTheorem 8. With no cycle cap there exists a graph G such that the price of fairness of G under the weighted fairness rule is bounded by POF(M, uWF ) \u2265 \u03b3\u03b3+1 .\nThese bounds show that weighted fairness allows for a price of fairness that approaches 1, i.e., arbitrarily bad, as the cycle cap, chain cap, or \u03b3 increase.\nWe have shown that the worst-case prices of fairness approach 1 under both the lexicographic and weighted fairness rules of Dickerson et al. (2014). Next, we propose a rule that favors disadvantaged groups, but also strictly limits the price of fairness using a parameter set by policymakers.\n4 Hybrid Fairness Rule In this section, we present a hybrid fair utility function that balances lexicographic fairness and a utilitarian objective. We generalize the hybrid utility function proposed by Hooker and Williams (2012), which chooses between a Rawlsian (or maximin) objective and a utilitarian objective for multiple classes of agents."}, {"heading": "4.1 Utilitarian and Rawlsian Fairness", "text": "Consider two classes of agents that receive utilities u1(X) and u2(X), respectively, for outcome X .

When the inequality exceeds a threshold \u2206 (i.e., |u1(X)\u2212u2(X)| > \u2206) they switch to a utilitarian objective that maximizes u1(X)+u2(X). The utility function for this rule is\nu\u2206(X) =  2 min(u1(X), u2(X)) + \u2206 if |u1(X)\u2212 u2(X)| \u2264 \u2206 u1(X) + u2(X)\notherwise.\nThe parameter \u2206 is problem-specific, and should be chosen by policymakers. Figure 2(a) shows the level sets of this utility function, with \u2206 = 2.

We propose a rule that implements lexicographic fairness only when inequality between groups does not exceed \u2206. This rule uses two steps: 1) determine whether inequality is small enough to use lexicographic fairness 2) choose the optimal outcome. These steps are outlined below, and formalized in Algorithm 1.\nStep 1: Find all outcomes that maximize a hybrid utility function, and determine whether lexicographic fairness is appropriate.\nWe use a utility function to identify outcomes that satisfy either a lexicographic or utilitarian objective.

Consider outcomes XF and XL in Figure 2(b). XF is in the fair region but does not maximize u1, so u\u22061(XF ) = 0; XL is in the utilitarian region but is less efficient, so u\u22061(XL) = u(XL). Under utility function u\u22061, the less-efficient outcome XL is chosen over XF .\nTo address this problem we introduce u\u2206 in Equation (4), which relaxes u\u22061. For outcomes in the fair region (that is, with |u1 \u2212 u2| \u2264 \u2206), utility is assigned proportional to u1.

In real exchanges, not all recommended edges in a matching result in successful transplants.

To calculate PoF we use the definition in Equation (1), using uE and uF . We define %F as the fraction of the maximum highly sensitized utility, achieved by M{\u03b1,\u03b3,\u2206}, defined as\n%F (M{\u03b1,\u03b3,\u2206},MF ) = uH(M{\u03b1,\u03b3,\u2206})/uH(MF ).\nPoF and %F indicate the efficiency loss and the fairness of each rule, respectively.\n3https://github.com/duncanmcelfresh/FairKidneyExchange"}, {"heading": "5.2 Results and Discussion", "text": "Each fairness rule offers a parameter that balances efficiency and fairness. Two of these rules guarantee a certain outcome: \u03b1-lexicographic guarantees fairness, but allows high efficiency loss, while hybrid-lexicographic bounds overall efficiency loss. Weighted fairness makes no guarantees.\nThe price of fairness can be high in real exchanges, especially when edge success probability p is small. In failureaware kidney exchange, cycles and chains of length k receive utility proportional to pk. Fair matchings often use longer cycles and chains than the efficient matching, in order to reach highly sensitized patients; this leads to a high price of fairness when p is small.\nEven when \u03b1 and \u03b3 are small, there are cases when both \u03b1-lexicographic and weighted fairness allow for a high PoF. This becomes worse with lower edge probability. Figure 3 shows the worst-case PoF and %F for each rule, for the smallest parameters tested, for a range of edge success probabilities. Appendix C contains results for all parameter values tested.\nHybrid-lexicographic fairness limits PoF within the guaranteed bound of 0.2; this comes at the cost of a low %F\u2014when edge success probability is small, hybridlexicographic fairness awards zero fair utility in the worst case. \u03b1-lexicographic fairness produces the opposite behavior: %F is always larger than the guaranteed bound of 0.1, but the worst-case price of fairness grows steadily as edge probability decreases.\nTheory suggests that the price of fairness is small on denser random graphs (see Section 2). We empirically confirm this theoretical finding by calculating the worst-case price of fairness and %F for random graphs of various sizes generated from real data; these results are given in Section C. In this case\u2014when the price of fairness is small\u2014 \u03b1-lexicographic fairness may be appropriate, as overall efficiency loss is not severe.\nBoth \u03b1-lexicographic and hybrid-lexicographic fairness\nare useful, depending on the desired outcome. Policymakers may choose between these rules, and set the parameters \u03b1 and \u2206 to guarantee either a minimum %F or a maximum price of fairness.\n6 Conclusion We addressed the classical problem of balancing fairness and efficiency in resource allocation, with a specific focus on the kidney exchange application area. Extending work by Ashlagi and Roth (2014) and Dickerson et al. (2014), we show that the theoretical price of fairness is small on a random graph model of kidney exchange, when both cycles and chains are used. However this model is too optimistic\u2014real kidney exchanges are less certain and more sparse, and in reality the price of fairness can be unacceptably high.\nDrawing on work by Hooker and Williams (2012), which is not applicable to kidney exchange, we provided the first approach to incorporating fairness into kidney exchange in a way that prioritizes marginalized participants, but also comes with acceptable worst-case guarantees on overall efficiency loss. Furthermore, our method is easily applied as an objective in the mathematical-programming-based clearing methods used in today\u2019s fielded exchanges. Using data from a large fielded kidney exchange, we showed that our method bounds efficiency loss while also prioritizing marginalized participants when possible.\nMoving forward, it would be of theoretical and practical interest to address fairness in a realistic dynamic model of a matching market like kidney exchange (Anshelevich et al. 2013; Akbarpour et al. 2014; Anderson et al. 2015; Dickerson and Sandholm 2015). For example, how does prioritizing a class of patients in the present affect their, or other groups\u2019, long-term welfare? Similarly, exploring the effect on long-term efficiency of the single-shot \u2206 we use in this paper would be of practical importance; to start, \u2206 can be viewed as a hyperparameter to be tuned (Thornton et al. 2013)."}, {"heading": "A Price of Fairness in the Random Graph Model", "text": "Ashlagi and Roth (2014) characterize efficient matchings in a random graph model without chains, and Dickerson et al. (2014) build on this to show that the price of fairness without chains is bounded above by 2/33. Dickerson et al. (2012) extend the efficient matching of Ashlagi and Roth (2014) to include chains, but do not calculate the price of fairness. We close the remaining theory gap regarding the price of fairness with chains. Appendix A.1 describes the random graph model, and Appendix A.2 presents the theoretical price of fairness with chains.\nA.1 Random Graph Model Let all patient-donor pairs P be partitioned into subsets V X-Y for each patient blood type X and donor blood type Y . These subsets will be further partitioned into lowly- and highly sensitized pairs V X-YL and V X-Y H . Let \u00b5X be the fraction of both patients and donors of each blood type X . Let NX be the set of NDDs of blood type X . Let \u03b2|P | be the total number of NDDs, with the same blood type distribution as patients. That is, |NX | = \u03b2\u00b5X |P |, with X \u2208 {A,B,AB,O}.\nPatient-donor vertices may be blood-type compatible, but will not be connected by a directed edge due to tissuetype incompatibility. Let p\u0304 be the fraction of patientdonor pairs that are blood-type-compatible, but tissue-typeincompatible.\nWe refer to certain blood-type vertex subsets of as follows:\n1. V A-B and V B-A: reciprocal pairs\n2. V X-X : self-demanded pairs\n3. V AB-B, V AB-A, V AB-O, V A-O, V B-O: over-demanded pairs\n4. V A-AB, V B-AB, V O-A, V O-B, V O-AB: under-demanded pairs\nTo reflect real-world exchanges, assume p\u0304 > 1 \u2212 \u03bb, \u00b5O > \u00b5A > \u00b5B > \u00b5AB, and p\u0304 < 2/5. WLOG, let |V A-B| > |V B-A|, and assume that the absolute difference between these pools grows sublinearly with the size of the exchange, that is |V A-B| \u2212 |V B-A| = o(n).\nA.2 The Price of Fairness With Chains We calculate the price of fairness in this model by exploring all of the possible ways that the efficient matching can proceed, which depends on \u03b2. We state without proof that there are only four possible matchings with nonzero price of fairness, and several matchings with zero price of fairness. It is tedious, but straightforward, to confirm this statement, using the assumptions made while constructing these matchings. Figure 4 shows each possible matching on this model, and some of the impossible matchings.\nPropositions 2, 3, 4, and 5 give the price of fairness for each of the four matchings with nonzero price of fairness; for each of these cases, \u03b2 < \u00b5AB(1\u2212 p\u0304). Proposition 1 states that the price of fairness is zero when \u03b2 > \u00b5AB(1\u2212 p\u0304).\nIn all of these matchings, the price of fairness is bounded above by the price of fairness without NDDs, found by Dickerson et al. (2014); Theorem 1 states this finding, which uses by Lemmas 2 and 3.\nTheorem 2 states that the price of fairness is zero when \u03b2 > 1/8, and Lemmas 4, 5, 6, and 7 give bounds on \u03b2 for each matching with nonzero price of fairness.\nWe start with the efficient matching proposed in (Dickerson et al. 2012) using cycles and chains up to length 3. This matching may proceed in many different ways, depending on \u03b2. However, most outcomes are impossible based on the canonical assumptions for the random graph model. Figure 4 shows all possible ways that the matching can proceed.\nLemma 1 states that even without chains, all highlysensitized patients except for those in V O-AB are matched in the efficient matching, only using cycles; this Lemma will be used in all following propositions.\nLemma 1. Denote by M the set of matchings in G(n) using cycles and chains up to length 3. As n \u2192 \u221e, a.s. all highly sensitized pairs can be matched with no efficiency loss under the lexicographic fairness rule, except for those of type O-AB.\n(This Lemma uses the same efficient matching introduced by Dickerson (Dickerson et al. 2012).)\nsketch. Begin with the efficient matching M\u2217 using only cycles up to length 3, proposed by Dickerson in (Dickerson et al. 2014). M\u2217 matches all over-demanded and selfdemanded vertices with high probability, but leaves some under-demanded vertices unmatched. We proceed through the initial steps of matching M\u2217 to show that all vertices in V O-AH , V O-B H , V A-AB H , and V B-AB H are matched.\n1. Match all vertices in V B-A in 2-cycles with V A-B, exhausting V B-A and leaving |V A-B| \u221d o(n). 2. Match all remaining vertices in V A-B in 3-cycles with V B-O and V O-A. There are only |V A-B| \u221d o(n) of these cycles, which will become negligible to the price of fairness as n\u2192\u221e. 3. Match all remaining vertices in V A-O in 2-cycles with V O-A. Note that |V A-O| \u221d p\u0304\u00b5A\u00b5O and |V O-A| \u221d \u00b5A\u00b5O. The V A-O vertices are exhausted first if |V A-O| < |V O-A|, which holds almost surely because p\u0304\u00b5A\u00b5O < \u00b5A\u00b5O due to the assumption p\u0304 < 2/5. All highly sensitized vertices V O-AH are matched because (1\u2212\u03bb)\u00b5A\u00b5O < p\u0304\u00b5A\u00b5O holds under the assumption 1 \u2212 \u03bb < p\u0304. Thus both V A-O and V O-AH are exhausted, and |V O-A| \u221d \u00b5A\u00b5O(1\u2212 p\u0304). 4. Match all remaining vertices in V B-O in 2-cycles with V O-B. Note that |V B-O| \u221d p\u0304\u00b5B\u00b5O and |V O-B| \u221d \u00b5B\u00b5O. As before, the a.s. |V O-B| > |V B-O|. All highly sensitized vertices V O-BH are matched a.s., because p\u0304\u00b5B\u00b5O > (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u00b5B\u00b5O holds under the assumption p\u0304 > 1\u2212\u03bb. Thus both V B-O and V O-BH are exhausted, and |V O-B| \u221d \u00b5B\u00b5O(1\u2212p\u0304). 5. Match all vertices in V AB-A in 2-cycles with V A-AB. Note that, |V AB-A| \u221d p\u0304\u00b5A\u00b5AB and |V A-AB| \u221d \u00b5A\u00b5AB. As before, a.s. |V A-AB| > |V A-AB|. All highly sensitized vertices V A-ABH are matched, because p\u0304\u00b5A\u00b5AB >\n123456\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u00b5A\u00b5AB under the assumption p\u0304 > 1 \u2212 \u03bb. Thus both V AB-A and V A-ABH are exhausted, and |V A-AB| \u221d \u00b5A\u00b5O(1\u2212 p\u0304). 6. Match all vertices in V AB-B in 2-cycles with V B-AB. Note that, |V AB-B| \u221d p\u0304\u00b5B\u00b5AB and |V B-AB| \u221d \u00b5B\u00b5AB, and a.s. |V B-AB| > |V AB-B|. All highly sensitized vertices V B-ABH are matched, because p\u0304\u00b5B\u00b5AB > (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u00b5B\u00b5AB under the assumption p\u0304 > 1 \u2212 \u03bb. Thus both V AB-B and V B-ABH are exhausted, and |V B-AB| \u221d \u00b5B\u00b5O(1\u2212 p\u0304).\nThus, these initial steps of matching M\u2217 exhaust all highly sensitized pairs in V O-AH , V O-B H , V A-AB H , and V B-AB H .\nWith uniform edge weights, lexicographic fairness requires that we match the maximum possible number of highly sensitized vertices. Lemma 1 states that the efficient matching M\u2217 includes all highly sensitized patients, except for those in V O-AB. Therefore all efficiency loss\u2013and price of fairness\u2013is caused by matching vertices in V O-ABH .\nUsing both chains and cycles increases overall efficiency. In the dense graph model used in this Appendix, adding chains can only decrease the price of fairness.\nProposition 1 in (Dickerson et al. 2014) states that with only cycles up to length 3, and assuming p\u0304 > 1 \u2212 \u03bb, and \u00b5O < 3\u00b5A/2, and \u00b5O > \u00b5A > \u00b5B > \u00b5AB, the price of\nfairness is at most 233 . In the dense graph model used here, adding chains tightens this upper bound.\nThe following propositions tighten the upper bound on the price of fairness, for every possible value of \u03b2.\nProposition 1. Assume\n1 \u03b2 > (1\u2212 p\u0304)\u00b5AB. Denote by M the set of matchings in G(n) using cycles and chains up to length 3. As n \u2192 \u221e, almost surely POF(M, uLEX) = 0.\nsketch. We begin by executing the initial steps of matching M\u2217 as done in the proof of Lemma 1, matching all highly sensitized vertices except for those in V O-ABH . The following steps continue the matching M\u2217 from Lemma 1.\n7. A- and B-type NDDs donate to V A-AB and V B-AB, respectively. Note that |NA| \u221d \u03b2\u00b5A and |V A-AB| \u221d (1 \u2212 p\u0304)\u00b5A\u00b5AB. Assuming \u03b2 > (1 \u2212 p\u0304)\u00b5AB, the inequality \u03b2\u00b5A > \u00b5A\u00b5AB(1 \u2212 p\u0304) holds and a.s. |NA| > |V A-AB|. By the same argument, a.s. |NB| > |V B-AB|. Thus, both V A-AB and V B-AB are exhausted, and |NB| \u221d \u00b5B (\u03b2 \u2212 (1\u2212 p\u0304)\u00b5AB) and |NA| \u221d \u00b5A (\u03b2 \u2212 (1\u2212 p\u0304)\u00b5AB).\n8. Create cycles of the form (AB-O, O-X, X-AB), with X \u2208 {A,B}. None of these cycles occur because both V A-AB and V B-AB have been exhausted in previous steps.\n9. Create chains of the form (O,O-X,X-AB), with X \u2208 {A,B}. None of these cycles occur, because both V A-AB and V B-AB have been exhausted in previous steps.\n10. Remaining O-type NDDs donate to remaining underdemanded vertices, beginning with V O-AB. Note that no O-type NDDs have been used in previous steps, so |NO| \u221d \u03b2\u00b5O. 11. 2-cycles are created with V AB-O and remaining underdemanded vertices, beginning with V O-AB. Note that no vertices in V AB-O have been used in previous steps, so |V AB-O| \u221d p\u0304\u00b5O\u00b5AB.\nThe final two steps match up to |V AB-O|+ |NO| \u221d \u03b2\u00b5O + p\u0304\u00b5O\u00b5AB vertices in V O-AB. The only remaining highlysensitized vertices are in V |HOAB \u221d (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u00b5O\u00b5AB. Assuming that p\u0304 > 1 \u2212 \u03bb, the inequality \u03b2\u00b5O + p\u0304\u00b5O\u00b5AB > p\u0304\u00b5O\u00b5AB > (1\u2212 \u03bb)\u00b5O\u00b5AB holds, and a.s. |V AB-O|+ |NO| > |V |HOAB|. This exhausts all vertices in |V O-ABH |. All other highly-sensitized vertices were matched in steps 1-6 of, as in Lemma 1. Thus, all highly sensitized vertices can be matched with no efficiency loss, and the price of fairness is zero.\nProposition1 assumes that \u03b2 is extremely large, specifically \u03b2 > 1/4 > (1\u2212 p\u0304)\u00b5AB. In practice, \u03b2 < 0.01 \u2013 that is, the number of NDDs in an exchange is often less than 1% of the size of the exchange. The following Propositions address the price of fairness when \u03b2 < (1\u2212 p\u0304)\u00b5AB < 1/4. Proposition 2. Assume\nA.1 \u03b2 < \u00b5A (1\u2212 p\u0304)\u2212 p\u0304\u00b5AB A.2 \u03b2 < \u00b5AB(1\u2212 p\u0304)\u2212 p\u0304\u00b5AB\u00b5O/\u00b5A A.3 \u03b2 < \u00b5AB ( \u00b5A \u00b5A+\u00b5O \u2212 p\u0304 )\nThese constraints imply \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1/8].Denote byM the set of matchings in G(n) using cycles and chains up to length 3.

We begin with matching M\u2217 as done in the proof of Lemma 1, matching all highly sensitized vertices except for those in V AB-OH . We now complete the efficient matching using both 3-cycles and 3-chains as in (Dickerson et al. 2012).\n7. A- and B-type NDDs donate to V A-AB and V B-AB, respectively. Note that |NA| \u221d \u03b2\u00b5A and |V A-AB| \u221d (1 \u2212 p\u0304)\u00b5A\u00b5AB. The inequality \u03b2\u00b5A < \u00b5A\u00b5AB(1\u2212 p\u0304) holds due\nto assumption A.2, and a.s. |NA| < |V A-AB|. By the same argument, a.s. |NB| < |V B-AB|. Thus, both NA and NB are exhausted, and |V A-AB| \u221d \u00b5A\u00b5AB(1 \u2212 p\u0304) \u2212 \u03b2\u00b5A and |V B-AB| \u221d \u00b5B\u00b5AB(1\u2212 p\u0304)\u2212 \u03b2\u00b5B.\n8.

Thus when \u03b2 = 0, POF0 = POFA, and when \u03b2 > 0, POF0 > POFA, and the price of fairness in Propositions 2 and 3 is bounded above by POF0.\nLemma 3.

(1) In both POF0 and POFB , the numerator is proportional to the number of remaining vertices in V O-ABH , after constructing the efficient matching. In Proposition 4 and 5 the efficient matching contains some vertices in V O-ABH ; without NDDs, the efficient matching contains no vertices in V O-ABH . Thus, the numerator of POFB is strictly smaller the numerator of POF0. (2) Let the D0 be the denominator of POF0, and DB be the denominator of POFB . We now show that the inequality D0 < DB holds. First, note that this inequality can be written as\n\u00b5AB \u2212 (1\u2212 p\u0304)\u00b52AB + \u03b2\u00b5O > \u00b5AB(p\u0304+ \u00b5O).

(12)\nWe now show that inequality 12 is satisfied by the the following assumption on \u03b2, made in Propositions 4 and 5:\nA : \u03b2 > \u00b5AB(1\u2212 p\u0304)\u2212 \u00b5AB\u00b5Op\u0304/\u00b5A. Next, we show that assumption A implies inequality 12, and thus assumption A implies D0 < DB . Assumption A implies 12 if the right-hand side of A is larger than the right hand side of 12, that is,\n\u00b5AB(1\u2212 p\u0304)\u2212 \u00b5AB\u00b5Op\u0304/\u00b5A > (\u00b5AB/\u00b5O)(1\u2212 p\u0304)\u00b5AB \u2212 (\u00b5AB/\u00b5O)(\u00b5A + \u00b5B + \u00b5AB \u2212 p\u0304)\nrearranging, we have\n1\u2212 p\u0304 p\u0304 > \u00b5O \u00b5A 1\u2212 \u00b5AB \u2212 \u00b5B 1\u2212 \u00b5B\nThe random graph model assumes p\u0304 \u2264 2/5, and \u00b5O \u2264 (3/2)\u00b5A, thus we have\n1\u2212 p\u0304 p\u0304 \u2265 3 2 > 3 2 1\u2212 \u00b5AB \u2212 \u00b5B 1\u2212 \u00b5B \u2265 \u00b5O \u00b5A 1\u2212 \u00b5AB \u2212 \u00b5B 1\u2212 \u00b5B .\nThis shows that assumption A implies D0 < DB . Thus, the numerator of POF0 is larger than the numerator of POFB , and the denominator of POF0 is smaller than the denominator of POFB , and therefore POFB < POF0.\nLemmas 2 and 3 show that with \u03b2 > 0, the price of fairness has the same upper bound as when \u03b2 = 0, given in Dickerson et al. (2014). That is, adding NDDs to the random graph model does not increase the price of fairness. Theorem 1. Adding NDDs to the random graph model (\u03b2 > 0) does not increase the upper bound on the price of fairness found by Dickerson et al. (2014).\nProof. When \u03b2 > 0, there are only four possible matchings with nonzero price of fairness, and the price of fairness for each case is given in Propositions 2, 3, 4, and 5. Lemmas 2 and 3 state that in each of these four cases, the matching with NDDs has a tighter bound on the price of fairness than the matching without NDDs, given in Dickerson et al. (2014).\nNext we show that the price of fairness is zero when \u03b2 > 1/8, by finding the maximum possible \u03b2 for each of the four cases with nonzero price of fairness. Lemma 4. In the matching described by Proposition 2, \u03b2 < 1/8.\nProof. Proposition 2 makes the following assumptions on \u03b2:\n1 \u03b2 < \u00b5A (1\u2212 p\u0304)\u2212 p\u0304\u00b5AB 2 \u03b2 < \u00b5AB(1\u2212 p\u0304)\u2212 p\u0304\u00b5AB\u00b5O/\u00b5A 3 \u03b2 < \u00b5AB ( \u00b5A \u00b5A+\u00b5O \u2212 p\u0304 )\nTo determine an upper bound on \u03b2, we maximize the right hand side of constraint 3. Note that the model assumes \u00b5AB < 1/4, \u00b5A < 1/2, and \u00b5A + \u00b5O < 1. Using these bounds, and p\u0304\u2192 0, constraint 3 is bounded by\n\u03b2 < \u00b5AB\n( \u00b5A \u00b5A + \u00b5O \u2212 p\u0304 ) < (1/4) (1/2) 1 = 1/8\n\u03b2 < 1/8\nConstraints 1 and 2 are looser than constraint 3: with the values p\u0304\u2192 0, \u00b5A \u2192 1/4, and \u00b5AB \u2192 1/4, both constraints reduce to \u03b2 < 1/4.\nLemma 5.

The price of fairness is zero when \u03b2 > 1/8.\nProof. There are only four matchings with nonzero price of fairness and \u03b2 > 0, which are described in Propositions 2, 3, 4, and 5. Lemmas 4, 5, 6, and 7 state that the maximum \u03b2 for any of these matchings is 1/8. When \u03b2 > 1/8, the matching is not one of these four cases, and the price of fairness is zero.\nTheorems 1 and 2 are the two main theoretical results of this paper: adding NDDs to the random graph model does not increase the upper bound on the price of fairness, and when the proportion of NDDs is high enough (\u03b2 > 1/8), the price of fairness is zero. We show this by addressing each of the four efficient matchings on the random graph model with nonzero price of fairness. In each case, and \u03b2 < 1/8, and the matching with NDDs has a smaller price of fairness than the matching without NDDs given in Dickerson et al. (2014).\nTo further explore these results, we numerically find the maximum price of fairness for the matchings given in Propositions 2, 3, 4, and 5. For each matching, we find the maximum price of fairness for a range of \u03b2, within the defined constraints, using the \u201cNMaximize\u201d function in Mathematica with the nonlinear interior point method.\nFigure A.2 confirms both of our main theoretical results: adding NDDs to the efficient matching decreases the upper bound on the price of fairness, and when \u03b2 > 1/8 the price of fairness is zero."}, {"heading": "B Price of Fairness for \u03b1-Lexicographic-, Weighted-, and Hybrid-Lexicographic Fairness", "text": "This section presents Theorems and Proofs regarding the price of fairness for the lexicographic, weighted, and hybridlexicographic fairness rules.\nB.1 Lexicographic Fairness Theorem 3.

Consider a kidney exchange graph consisting of one highly-sensitized patient H and L non-highly-sensitized patients Vi that form a directed cycle of length L. A 2-cycle connects H with one Vi, as shown in Figure 6. With a cycle cap of L, the optimal utilitarian matching has utility L, while the optimal lexicographic matching has utility u\u03b1 = 2, for any 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1.

For any cycle cap L and \u03b3 \u2265 L \u2212 1, there exists a graph G such that the price of fairness of G under the weighted fairness rule is bounded by POF(M, uWF ) \u2265 L\u22122 L .\nProof. Consider the graph used in the proof of Theorem 3, with all edge weights equal to 1. Weighted fairness increases the weight of the edge ending in H to (1+\u03b3). The weighted utility of the 2-cycle is 2 + \u03b3, while the weighted utility of the L-cycle is L. If \u03b3 is chosen such that \u03b3 \u2265 L \u2212 2, then the 2-cycle will be chosen over the L-cycle, resulting in the price of fairness POF(M, uWF ) = (L\u2212 2)/L.\nTheorem 6.

Under weighted fairness, the Vi chain receives utility uL = b(\u03b3 + 1)Nc \u2212 1 while the Hi chain receives utility uH = (\u03b3 + 1)N , so uH > uL.

Under weighted fairness, the Vi cycle receives utility uL = b(\u03b3 + 1)Nc, while theHi chain receives utility uH = (\u03b3 + 1)N + 1, so uH > uL.

Each fairness rule effectively chooses one of these matchings, based on a fairness criteria. Especially with sparse graphs, fairness is often achieved by using longer cycles or cycles to match highly sensitized vertices. When edge success probability p is high, fairness has little effect on overall utility, and PoF is often below 0.3. With lower edge success probability, using longer cycles and chains causes a huge loss in efficiency: the expected utility of n-cycles and chains is proportional to pn, which incurs a huge penalty for long cycles and chains when p is small. Thus as p decreases, very small \u03b1 and \u03b2 values result in a high PoF. Our results show that for p \u2264 0.8, even the smallest parameters for \u03b1-lexicographic and weighted fairness (\u03b1 = 0.1 and \u03b2 = 2) achieve the worst-case PoF. As expected, hybrid-lexicographic fairness limits PoF according to Theorem 9. With two classes of patients (highly- and lowly-sensitized), the theoretical price of fairness is bounded by POF(M, u\u2206) \u2264 2\u2206/u(ME); in the Figures, \u2206 is scaled by u(ME), so the upper bound on the price of fairness has a slope of two.\n0. 0 0. 2 0. 4 0. 6 0. 8\nMax.PoF\np =\n0. 1\np =\n0. 2\np =\n0 .3\np =\n0. 4\np =\n0 .5\np =\n0 .6\np =\n0. 7\np =\n0 .8\np =\n0. 9\nChainCap=0.0\np =\n1. 0\n0. 0 0. 2 0. 4 0. 6 0. 8\nMax.PoF\nChainCap=3.0\n0. 0 0. 2 0. 4 0. 6 0. 8\nMax.PoF\nChainCap=10.0\n0 1 F ra ct io n of m ax . p a ra m et er\n0. 0 0. 2 0. 4 0. 6 0. 8\nMax.PoF\n0 1 F ra ct io n of m ax . p a ra m et er\n0 1 F ra ct io n of m ax . p ar am et er\n0 1 F ra ct io n o f m a x . p ar am et er\n0 1 F ra ct io n o f m ax . p ar am et er\n0 1 F ra ct io n of m ax . p ar am et er\n0 1 F ra ct io n of m a x . p a ra m et er\n0 1 F ra ct io n o f m ax . p ar am et er\n0 1 F ra ct io n of m ax . p ar am et er\n0 1 F ra ct io n of m ax . p ar am et er\nChainCap=20.0\nF a ir\nn es\ns ru\nle\nw ei\ngh te\nd\n\u03b1 -l\nex .\nh y b\nri d\nle x .\nFi gu\nre 8:\nM ax\nim um\nPo F\nfo r\nea ch\nfa ir\nne ss\nru le\n.P ar\nam et\ner s\nfo r\nea ch\nru le\nar e \u03b1 \u2208\n[0 ,1\n], \u03b2 \u2208\n[0 ,2\n0 ],\nan d\n\u2206 \u2208\n[0 ,u\n(M E\n)] .R\now s\nco rr\nes po\nnd to\ned ge\nsu cc\nes s\npr ob\nab ili\ntie s\nfr om\n0. 1\nto 1.\n0; co\nlu m\nns co\nrr es\npo nd\nto di\nff er\nen tc\nha in\nca ps\n:0 ,3\n,a nd\n2 0\n.\nTo illustrate the other side of the fairness-efficiency tradeoff, we consider worst case %F . Figure C.1 shows the minimum (worst case) %F over all UNOS graphs for each fairness rule, and for various edge success probabilities and chain caps.\nAs expected, \u03b1-lexicographic fairness guarantees at %F \u2265 \u03b1; weighted and hybrid-lexicogrpahic fairness do not make this guarantee. Small edge success probabilities make it impossible to match highly sensitized patients without large efficiency loss; when p becomes small hybridlexicographic fairness matches no highly sensitized patients in the worst case.\nThese results demonstrate the balance between fairness and efficiency offered by both \u03b1-lexicographic and hybridlexicographic fairness. If fairness is more important than efficiency, then the \u03b1-lexicographic rule can be used to guarantee that the resulting matching achieves at least fraction \u03b1 of the maximum possible fair score. Alternatively, if efficiency is more important than fairness, hybrid-lexicographic fairness can bound the price of fairness using parameter \u2206.\nC.2 Simulated Exchange Graphs Simulated exchange graphs were drawn from previous UNOS exchanges, using the same method as Dickerson et al. (2013). These graphs are typically denser than real graphs, and have a much lower price of fairness.

The price of fairness measures the worst-case loss of economic efficiency when using an inefficient but fair allocation rule; for indivisible goods in many settings, this price is unacceptably high. One such setting is kidney exchange, where needy patients swap willing but incompatible kidney donors. In this work, we close an open problem regarding the theoretical price of fairness in modern kidney exchanges. We then propose a general hybrid fairness rule that balances a strict lexicographic preference ordering over classes of agents, and a utilitarian objective that maximizes economic efficiency. We develop a utility function for this rule that favors disadvantaged groups lexicographically; but if cost to overall efficiency becomes too high, it switches to a utilitarian objective. This rule has only one parameter which is proportional to a bound on the price of fairness, and can be adjusted by policymakers. We apply this rule to real data from a large kidney exchange and show that our hybrid rule produces more reliable outcomes than other fairness rules.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
