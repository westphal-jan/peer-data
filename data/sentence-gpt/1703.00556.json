While there are some well-known design principles, including simplicity and consistency, there are o en also unexpected interactions between elements of the page that determine how well it converts. e same element, such as a headline, image, or testimonial, may work well in one context but not in others\u2014it is o en hard to predict the result, and even harder to decide how to improve a given page.\nAn entire sub eld of information technology has emerged in this area, called conversion rate optimization, or conversion science. e standard method is A/B testing, i.e. designing two di erent versions of the same page, showing them to di erent users, and collecting statistics on how well they each convert [8]. is process allows incorporating human knowledge about the domain and conversion optimization into the design, and then testing their e ect. A er observing the results, new designs can be compared and gradually improved. e A/B testing process is di cult and time-consuming: Only a very small fraction of page designs can be tested in this way, and subtle interactions in the design are likely to go unnoticed and unutilized. An alternative to A/B is multivariate testing, where all value combinations of a few elements are tested at once. While this\nprocess captures interactions between these elements, only a very small number of elements is usually included (e.g. 2-3); the rest of the design space remains unexplored.\nis paper describes a new technology for conversion optimization based on evolutionary computation. is technology is implemented in Ascend, a conversion optimization product by Sentient Technologies, deployed in numerous e-commerce websites of paying customers since September 2016 [13]. Ascend uses a customer-designed search space as a starting point. It consists of a list of elements on the web page that can be changed, and their possible alternative values, such as a header text, font, and color, background image, testimonial text, and content order. Ascend then automatically generates web-page candidates to be tested, and improves those candidates through evolutionary optimization.\nBecause e-commerce sites o en have high volume of tra c, tness evaluations can be done live with a large number of real users in parallel. e evolutionary process in Ascend can thus be seen as a massively parallel version of interactive evolution, making it possible to optimize web designs in a fewweeks. From the application point of view, Ascend is a novel method for massively multivariate optimization of web-page designs. Depending on the application, improvements of 20-200% over human design have been observed through this approach [13].\nis paper describes the technology underlying Ascend, presents an example use case, and outlines future opportunities for evolutionary computation in optimizing e-commerce."}, {"heading": "2 BACKGROUND", "text": "With the explosive growth of e-commerce in recent years, entirely new areas of study have emerged. One of the main ones is conversion rate optimization, i.e. the study of how web interfaces should be designed so that they are as e ective as possible in converting users from casual browsers to actual customers. Conversion means taking a desired action on the web interface such as making a purchase, registering for a marketing list, or clicking on other desired link in an email, website, or desktop, mobile, or social media application [1, 11]. Conversions are usually measured in number of clicks, but also in metrics such as resulting revenue or time spent on the site and rate of return to the site.\nConversions are currently optimized in a labor-intensive manual process that requires signi cant expertise. e web design expert or marketer rst creates designs that s/he believes to be e ective. ese designs are then tested in an A/B testing process, by directing user tra c to them, and measuring how well they convert. If the conversion rates are statistically signi cantly di erent, the be er design is adopted. is design can then be improved further, using\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n00 55\n6v 4\n[ cs\n.H C\n] 3\n0 A\npr 2\n01 7\ndomain expertise to change it, in another few rounds of creation and testing.\nConversion optimization is a fast-emerging component of ecommerce. In 2016, companies spent over $72 billion to drive customers to their websites [5]. Much of that investment does not result in sales: conversion rates are typically 2-4% (i.e. 2-4% of the users that come to the site convert within 30 days). In 2014, only 18% of the top 10,000 e-commerce sites did any conversion optimization; in January 2017, 30% of them did so [4]. e growth is largely due to available conversion optimization tools, such as Optimizely, Visual Website Optimizer, Mixpanel, and Adobe Target [4]. ese tools make it possible to con gure the designs easily, allocate users to them, record the results, and measure signi cance.\nis process has several limitations. First, while the tools make the task of designing e ective web interfaces easier, the design is still done by human experts. e tools thus provide support for con rming the experts\u2019 ideas, not helping them explore and discover novel designs. Second, since each step in the process requires statistical signi cance, only a few designs can be tested. ird, each improvement step amounts to one step in hillclimbing; such a process can get stuck in local maxima. Fourth, the process is aimed at reducing false positives and therefore increases false negatives, i.e. designs with good ideas may be overlooked. Fi h, while the tools provide support for multivariate testing, in practice only a few combinations can be tested (e.g. ve possible values for two elements, or three possible values for three elements). As a result, it is di cult to discover and utilize interactions between design elements.\nEvolutionary optimization is well suited to address these limitations. Evolution is an e cient method for exploration; only weak statistical evidence is needed for progress; its stochastic nature avoids ge ing stuck in local maxima; good ideas will gradually become more prevalent. Most importantly, evolution searches for e ective interactions. For instance, Ascend may nd that the button needs to be green, but *only* when it is transparent, *and* the header is in small font, *and* the header text is aligned. Such interactions are very di cult to nd using A/B testing, requiring human insight into the results. Evolution makes this discovery process automatic. With Ascend, it is thus possible to optimize conversions be er and at a larger scale than before.\nTechnically, Ascend is related to approaches to interactive evolution [12, 15] and crowdsourcing [2, 9] in that evaluations of candidates are done online by human users. e usual interactive evolution paradigm, however, employs a relatively small number of human evaluators, and their task is to select good candidates or evaluate the tness of a pool of candidates explicitly. In contrast in Ascend, a massive number of human users are interacting with the candidates, and tness is derived from their actions (i.e. convert or not) implicitly."}, {"heading": "3 THE ASCEND METHOD", "text": "Ascend consists of de ning the space of possible web interfaces, initializing the population with a good coverage of that space, allocating tra c to candidates intelligently so that bad designs can be eliminated early, and testing candidates online in parallel. Each of these steps is described in more detail in this section.\n3.1 De ning the Search Space e starting point for Ascend is a search space de ned by the web designer. Ascend can be con gured to optimize a design of a single web-page, or a funnel consisting of multiple pages such as the landing page, selections, and a shopping cart. For each such space, the designer speci es the elements on that page and values that they can take. For instance in the landing page example of Figure 1, logo size, header image, bu on color, content order are such elements, and they can each take on 2-4 values.\nAscend searches for good designs in the space of possible combinations of these values. is space is combinatorial, and can be very large, e.g. 1.1M in this example. Interestingly, it is exactly this combinatorial nature that makes web-page optimization a good application for evolution: Even though human designers have insight into what values to use, their combinations are di cult to predict, and need to be discovered by search process such as evolution.\n3.2 Initializing Evolution A typical setup is that there is already a current design for the web interface, and the goal for Ascend is to improve over its performance. at is, the current design of the web interface is designated as the Control, and improvement is measured compared to that particular design.\nBecause tness is evaluated with real users, exploration incurs real cost to the customer. It is therefore important that the candidates perform reasonably well throughout evolution, and especially in the beginning.\nIf the initial population is generated randomly, many web interfaces would perform poorly. Instead, the initial population is created using the Control as a starting point: e candidates are created by changing the value of one element systematically. In a small search space, the initial population thus consists of all candidates with one di erence from the control; in a large search space, the population is a sample of the set of such candidates. With such an initialization, most of the candidates perform similarly to the control. e candidates also cover the search dimensions well, thus forming a good starting point for evolution.\n3.3 Evolutionary Process Each page is represented as a genome, as shown for two example pages in Figure 2 (le side). e usual genetic operations such as crossover (re-combination of the elements in the two genomes; middle) and mutation (randomly changing one element in the o - spring; right side) are then performed to create new candidates. In the current implementation, tness-proportionate selection is used to generate o spring candidates from the current population. From the current population of n candidates, another n new candidates are generated in this way.\nBecause evaluations are expensive, consuming tra c for which most customers have to pay, it is useful to minimize them during evolution. Each page needs to be tested only to the extent that it is possible to decide whether it is promising, i.e. whether it should serve as a parent in the next generation, or should be discarded. A process similar to age-layering [7, 14] is therefore used to allocate tness evaluations. At each generation, each new candidate and each old candidate is evaluated with a small number (a maturity\nage) of user interactions, such as 2000. e top n candidates are retained, and the bo omn discarded. In this manner, bad candidates are eliminated quickly. Good candidates receive progressively more evaluations, and the con dence in their tness estimate increases.\nIn this process, Ascend learns which combinations of elements are e ective, and gradually focuses the search around the most promising designs. It is thus su cient to test only a tiny fraction of the search space to nd the best ones, i.e. thousands of pages instead of millions or billions.\n3.4 Online Evolution While in simple cases (where the space of possible designs is small) such optimization can potentially be carried out by simpler mechanisms such as systematic search, hill-climbing, or reinforcement\nlearning, the population-based approach is particularly e ective because the evaluations can be done in parallel. e entire population can be tested at once, as di erent users interact with the site simultaneously. It is also unnecessary to test each design to statistical signi cance; only weak statistical evidence is su cient to proceed in the search. In this process, thousands of page designs can be tested in a short time, which is impossible through A/B or multivariate testing.\nFigure 3 shows the overall architecture of the system. A population of alternative designs (center) are adapted (right) based on evaluations with actual users (le ). e population of designs (center) are evaluated with many users in parallel (le ). e evolutionary process (right) generates new designs and outputs the best design in the end. e system also keeps track of which design has\nbeen show to which user, so that they get to see the same design if they return within a certain time limit (e.g. the same day)."}, {"heading": "4 CASE STUDY", "text": "As an example of how Ascend works, let us consider a case study on optimizing the web interface for a media site that connects users to online education programs. is experiment was run in September through November 2016 on the desktop tra c of the site.\ne initial design for this page is shown in the le side of Figure 4. It had been hand designed using standard tools such as Optimizely. Its conversion rate during the time of the experiment was found to be 5.61%, which is typical of such web interfaces. Based on this page, the web designers came up with nine elements, with two to nine values each, resulting in 381,024 potential combinations (Figure 5). While much larger search spaces are possible, this example represents a mid-size space common with many current sites.\ne initial population of 37 candidates was formed by systematically replacing each of the values in the control page with one of the alternative values, as described in section 3.2. Evolution was then run for 60 days, or four generations, altogether testing 111 candidates with 599,008 user interactions total. e estimated conversion rates of the candidates over this time are shown in Figure 6. e conversion rates of the top 20 candidates are shown in Figure 7. ese gures show that evolution was successful in discovering signi cantly be er candidates than control.\nAs an independent veri cation, the three top candidates in Figure 4 were then subjected to an A/B test using Optimizely. In about 6500 user interactions, the best candidate was con rmed to increase the conversion rate by 43.5% with greater than 99% signi cance (and the other two by 37.1% and 28.2%)\u2014which is an\nexcellent result given that the control was a candidate that was already hand-optimized using state-of-the art tools.\nUnlike Control, the top candidates utilize bright background colors to draw a ention to the widget. ere is an important interaction between the background and the blue banner (whose color was xed)\u2014in the best two designs (in the middle) the background is distinct from the banner but not competing with it. Moreover, given the colored background, a white bu on with black text provided the most clear call for action. It is di cult to recognize such interactions ahead of time, yet evolution discovered them early on, and many of the later candidates built on them. Other factors such as an active call to action (i.e. \u201cGet Started\u201d and \u201cFind my Program\u201d rather than \u201cRequest Info\u201d) ampli ed it further. At the time evolution was turned o , be er designs were still being discovered, suggesting that a more prolonged evolution and a larger search space (e.g. including banner color and other choices) could have improved the results further."}, {"heading": "5 FUTUREWORK", "text": "Ascend has been applied to numerous web interfaces, and it has consistently improved conversion rates by 20-200% compared to hand designed controls [13]. emain limitation is o en the human element: web designers, who are used to A/B and multivariate testing, o en try to minimize the search space, i.e. the number of elements and values, as much as possible, thereby not giving evolution much space to explore and discover powerful solutions. O en the evolution discovers signi cant improvement in a couple of generations, and the designers are eager to adopt them right away, instead of le ing evolution optimize the designs fully. Populationbased optimization requires di erent thinking; as designers become\nmore comfortable with it, we believe they will let evolution take its course, reaching more re ned results.\nCurrently Ascend delivers one best design, or a small number of good ones, in the end as the result, again in keeping with the A/B testing tradition. In many cases there are seasonal variations and other long-term changing trends, making the performance of good designs gradually decay. It is possible to counter this problem by running the optimization again every few months. However, a new paradigm of \u201calways-on\u201d would be more appropriate: Evolutionary optimization can be run continuously at a low volume, keeping up with changing trends (i.e. through dynamic evolutionary optimization; [3]). New designs can then be adopted periodically when their performance exceeds old designs signi cantly.\nFurthermore, currently Ascend optimizes a single design to be used with all future users of a mobile or desktop site. An interesting extension would be to take user segmentation [16] into account, and evolve di erent pages for di erent kinds of users. Moreover, such a mapping from user characterizations to page designs can be automatic: A mapping system such as a neural network can take user variables such as location, time, device, any past history with the site as inputs, and generate the vector of elements and their values as outputs. Neuroevolution [6, 10] can discover optimal such mappings, in e ect evolve to discover a dynamic, continuous segmentation of the user space. Users will be shown designs that are likely to convert well based on experience with other users with similar characteristics, continuously and automatically. It will be possible to analyze such evolved neural networks and discover what variables are most predictive, characterize the main user segments, and thereby develop an in-depth understanding of the opportunity.\nFinally, the Ascend approach is not limited to optimizing conversions. Any outcome that can be measured, such as revenue or user retention, can be optimized. e approach can also be used in\na di erent role, such as optimizing the amount of resources spent on a racting users, such as ad placement and selection, adword bidding, and email marketing. e approach can be seen as a fundamental step in bringing machine optimization into e-commerce, and demonstrating the value of evolutionary computation in real-world problems."}, {"heading": "6 CONCLUSION", "text": "Sentient Ascend demonstrates how interactive evolution can be scaled up by testing a large number of candidates in parallel on real users. It includes technology for keeping the cost of exploration reasonable, and for minimizing the number of evaluations needed. From the application point of view, Ascend is the rst automated system for massively multivariate conversion optimization\u2014 replacing A/B with AI. It nds the subtle combinations of variables that lead to conversion increases. e web designer can spend more time trying ideas and less time doing statistics, giving them the freedom they need to make a di erence."}], "references": [{"title": "Landing Page Optimization: \u008ae De\u0080nitie Guide to Testing and Tuning for Conversions (second ed.)", "author": ["Tim Ash", "Rich Page", "Maura Ginty"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2012}, {"title": "Evolutionary Optimization in Dynamic Environments", "author": ["J\u00fcrgen Branke"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2002}, {"title": "Neuroevolution: From Architectures to Learning", "author": ["Dario Floreano", "Peter D\u00fcrr", "Claudio Ma\u008aiussi"], "venue": "Evolutionary Intelligence", "citeRegEx": "6", "shortCiteRegEx": "6", "year": 2008}, {"title": "Introducing an Age-Varying Fitness Estimation Function", "author": ["Babak Hodjat", "Hormoz Shahrzad"], "venue": null, "citeRegEx": "7", "shortCiteRegEx": "7", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Online Controlled Experiments and A/B Tests.
