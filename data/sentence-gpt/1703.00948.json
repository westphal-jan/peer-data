The data set contains total of 13,000 characters - a bit more than what we currently know.\n\n\n\n\nNow the basic data set is set using the OpenTable API, which contains the dictionary itself. This is an important step in this work, and it has improved over the previous two years. We can take a look at our API in action here.\nWhen we have data sets to describe, we can add a few additional annotations that allow us to easily define the user\u2019s actions.\nFor example, here's the result.\nNote: Since we haven't yet set up a dictionary, I'll add an annotation to that collection to create an annotated Wikipedia text page.\nI added a new annotation to that collection:\npublic class Wikipedia { public static public static public string username = \"JohnJohn\" ; public static public static class username = \"John\" ; public static public static class username = \"John\" ; public static public static class username = \"John\" ; public static public static class username = \"John\" ; public static private static class username = \"John\" ; public static public static class username = \"John\" ; public static public static class username = \"John\" ; public static private static class username = \"John\" ; public static public static class username = \"John\" ; public static static class username = \"John\" ; public static static class username = \"John\" ; public static static class username = \"John\" ; public static public static class username = \"John\" ; public static public static class username = \"John\" ; public static static class username = \"John\" ; public static public static class username = \"John\" ; public static static class username = \"John\" ; public static public static class username = \"John\" ; public static public static class username = \"John\" ; public static static class username = \"John\" ; public static class username = \"John\" ; public static private static class username = \"John\" ; public static public static class username = \"John\" ; public static static class username = \"John\" ; public static public static class username = \"John\" ; public static public static class username = \"John\" ; public static public static class username = \"John\"", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Mar 2017 20:55:20 GMT  (4036kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00948v1", "8 pages, 3 figures, 7 tables, WWW2017, WWW 2017 Companion proceedings"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 3 figures, 7 tables, WWW2017, WWW 2017 Companion proceedings", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["nemanja spasojevic", "preeti bhargava", "guoning hu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.00948"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.00948.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "DAWT: Densely Annotated Wikipedia Texts across multiple languages", "authors": ["Nemanja Spasojevic", "Preeti Bhargava", "Guoning Hu"], "emails": ["guoning.hu}@lithium.com"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "Keywords Wiki, Wikipedia, Freebase, Freebase annotations, Wikipedia annotations, Wikification, Named Entity Recognition, Entity Disambiguation, Entity Linking"}, {"heading": "1. INTRODUCTION", "text": "Over the past decade, the amount of data available to enterprises has grown exponentially. However, a majority of this data is unstructured or free-form text, also known as Dark Data1. This data holds challenges for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) tasks unless the text is semantically labeled. Two NLP tasks that are particularly important to the IR community are:\n1https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_data\n.\n\u2022 Named Entity Recognition (NER) - task of identifying an entity mention within a text, \u2022 Entity Disambiguation and Linking (EDL) - task of\nlinking the mention to its correct entity in a Knowledge Base (KB).\nThese tasks play a critical role in the construction of a high quality information network which can be further leveraged for a variety of IR and NLP tasks such as text categorization, topical interest and expertise modeling of users [20, 21]. Moreover, when any new piece of information is extracted from text, it is necessary to know which real world entity this piece refers to. If the system makes an error here, it loses this piece of information and introduces noise. As a result, both these tasks require high quality labeled datasets with densely extracted mentions linking to their correct entities in a KB.\nWikipedia has emerged as the most complete and widely used KB over the last decade. As of today, it has around 5.3 million English articles and 38 million articles across all languages. In addition, due to its open nature and availability, Wikipedia Data Dumps have been adopted by academia and industry as an extremely valuable data asset. Wikipedia precedes other OpenData projects like Freebase [8] and DBpedia [10] which were built on the foundation of Wikipedia. The Freebase Knowledge Graph is the most exhaustive knowledge graph capturing 58 million entities and 3.17 billion facts. The Wikipedia and Freebase data sets are large in terms of: \u2022 information comprehensiveness, \u2022 wide language coverage, \u2022 number of cross-article links, manually curated cross\nentity relations, and language independent entity identifiers.\nAlthough these two data sets are readily available, Wikipedia link coverage is relatively sparse as only the first entity mention is linked to the entity\u2019s Wikipedia article. This sparsity may significantly reduce the number of training samples one may derive from Wikipedia articles which, in turn, reduces the utility of the dataset. In this work, we primarily focus on creating the DAWT dataset that contains denser annotations across Wikipedia articles. We leverage Wikipedia and Freebase to build a large data set of annotated text where entities extracted from Wikipedia text are mapped to Freebase ids. Moreover, this data set spans multiple languages. In addition to the main dataset, we open up several derived datasets for mention occurrence counts, entity occurrence counts, mention entity cooccurrence counts and entity Word2Vec. We also discuss two applications of these datasets and hope that opening\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n00 94\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.I R\n] 2\nM ar\n2 01\n7\nthem up would prove useful for the NLP and IR communities as well as facilitate multi-lingual research."}, {"heading": "2. PROBLEM STATEMENT", "text": "The Wikification problem was introduced by Mihalcea et al. [13], where task was to introduce hyperlinks to the correct wikipedia articles for a given mention. In Wikipedia, only the first mention is linked or annotated. In our task, we focus on densifying the annotations i.e. denser hyperlinks from mentions in Wikipedia articles to other Wikipedia articles. The ultimate goal is to have high-precision hyperlinks with relatively high recall that could be further used as ground truth for other NLP tasks.\nFor most of the supervised Machine Learning or NLP tasks, one of the challenges is gathering ground truth at scale. In this work, we try to solve the problem of generating a labeled data set at large scale with the following constraints: \u2022 The linked entity ids need to be unified across differ-\nent languages. In Freebase, the machine id is same across different languages and hence, we annotate Wikipedia with Freebase machine ids, \u2022 The dataset needs to be comprehensive (with large\nnumber of entities spanning multiple domains), \u2022 The labels should be precise."}, {"heading": "3. CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "Our contributions in this work are: \u2022 We extract a comprehensive inventory of mentions\nspanning several domains. \u2022 We densify the entity links in the Wikipedia docu-\nments by 4.8 times. \u2022 The DAWT dataset covers several more languages in\naddition to English such as Arabic, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. \u2022 Finally, we open up this dataset and several other de-\nrived datasets (such as mention occurrence counts, entity occurrence counts, mention entity co- occurrence counts, entity word2vec and mappings between Freebase ids and Wikidata item ids) for the benefit of the IR and NLP communities."}, {"heading": "4. KNOWLEDGE BASE", "text": "Our KB consists of about 1 million Freebase2 machine ids for entities. These were chosen from a subset of all Freebase entities that map to Wikipedia entities. We prefer to use Freebase as our KB since in Freebase, the same id represents a unique entity across multiple languages. For a more general use, we have also provided the mapping from Freebase id to Wikipedia link and Wikidata item id (see Section 6.4). Due to limited resources and usefulness of the entities, our KB contains approximately 1 million most important entities from among all the Freebase entities. This gives us a good balance between coverage and relevance of entities for processing common social media text. To this end, we calculate an entity importance score [2] using linear regression with features capturing popularity within Wikipedia links, and importance of the entity within Freebase. We used signals such as Wiki page rank,\n2Freebase was a standard community generated KB until June 2015 when Google deprecated it in favor of the commercially available Knowledge Graph API.\nWiki and Freebase incoming and outgoing links, and type descriptors within our KB etc. We use this score to rank the entities and retain only the top 1 million entities in our KB.\nIn addition to the KB entities, we also employ two special entities: NIL and MISC. NIL entity indicates that there is no entity associated with the mention, eg. mention \u2018the\u2019 within the sentence may link to entity NIL. This entity is useful especially when dealing with stop words and false positives. MISC indicates that the mention links to an entity which is outside the selected entity set in our KB."}, {"heading": "5. DAWT DATA SET GENERATION", "text": "Our main goals when building the DAWT data set were to maintain high precision and increase linking coverage. As shown in Figure 1, we first generate a list of candidate phrases mapping to the Wikipedia articles by combining: \u2022 Wiki articles (direct anchor texts, titles of pages, redi-\nrect text to wiki pages) \u2022 Freebase Aliases, and Freebase Also Known As fields\nrelated to entities \u2022 Wikipedia Concepts (English anchor texts)\nThe initial candidate lists are pruned to remove outlier phrases that do not semantically align with the rest of the list. As a semantic alignment metrics of two phrases, we used a combination of Jaccard similarity (both token and 3- gram character), edit distance (token and character), and largest common subsequence. We averaged the metrics and for each candidate in the list, we calculated average alignment against all the other candidates. As final step we remove all candidates, if any, with the lowest alignment scores.\nFor example, in the candidate set {\u2018USA\u2019, \u2018US\u2019, \u2018our\u2019, ... } for entity USA, phrase \u2018our\u2019 does not align with rest of the cluster and is filtered out. In addition to the candidate dictionary, we also calculate co-occurrence frequencies, based on direct links from Wikipedia article markup, between any 2 entities appearing within the same sentence.\nTo generate the DAWT dataset, we do the following. For each supported language, and for each Wiki page in the language:\n1. Iterate over the Wiki article and extract the set of directly linked entities. 2. Calculate all probable co-occurring entities with the set of directly linked entities from Step 1. 3. Iterate over the Wiki article and map all phrases to their set of candidate entities. 4. Resolve phrases whose candidates have been directly linked from Step 1.\n5. For the remaining unresolved references, choose candidates, if any, with the highest probable co-occurrence with the directly linked entities.\nAs a last step, the hyperlinks to Wikipedia articles in a specific language are replaced with links to their Freebase ids to adapt to our KB.\nThe densely annotated Wikipedia articles have on an average 4.8 times more links than the original articles. A detailed description of the data set, per language, along with total CPU time taken for annotation is shown in Table 1. All experiments were run on a 8-core 2.4GHz Xeon processor with 13 GB RAM. As evident, since English had the highest count of documents as well as entities and mentions, it took the maximum CPU time for annotation.\nAn example of the densely annotated text in JSON format is given below:\nListing 1: Annotated example in JSON file format\n1 { 2 \"tokens\": [{ 3 \"raw_form\": \"Vlade\" 4 }, { 5 \"raw_form\": \"Divac\" 6 }, { 7 \"raw_form\": \"is\" 8 }, { 9 \"raw_form\": \"a\"\n10 }, { 11 \"raw_form\": \"retired\" 12 }, { 13 \"raw_form\": \"Serbian\" 14 }, { 15 \"raw_form\": \"NBA\" 16 }, { 17 \"raw_form\": \"player\", 18 \"break\": [\"SENTENCE\"] 19 }], 20 \"entities\": [{ 21 \"id_str\": \"01vpr3\", 22 \"type\": \"PERSON\", 23 \"start_position\": 0, 24 \"end_position\": 1, 25 \"raw_form\": \"Vlade Divac\" 26 }, { 27 \"id_str\": \"077qn\", 28 \"type\": \"LOCATION\", 29 \"start_position\": 5, 30 \"end_position\": 5, 31 \"raw_form\": \"Serbian\" 32 }, { 33 \"id_str\": \"05jvx\", 34 \"type\": \"ORGANIZATION\",\nMention Occurrence Count Apple 16104 apple 2742 Tesla 822"}, {"heading": "6.

Table 5 shows the raw and normalized mention entity cooccurrences for the mentions \u201cApple\" and \u201capple\" and different candidate entities. As evident, the probability of mention \u201cApple\" referring to the entity Apple Inc. is higher than to the entity Apple (fruit). However, \u201capple\" most\nlikely refers to the entity Apple (fruit). Similarly, the mention \u201cTesla\" most likely refers to the entity Nikola Tesla."}, {"heading": "6.4 Freebase id to Wikidata id Mappings", "text": "In this data set, we use the Freebase machine id to represent an entity. To facilitate studies using Wikidata ids, which are also widely used entity ids in the literatures, we provide a data set that maps individual Freebase ids to Wikidata ids. This data set contains twice as many mappings as that from Google3. A summary comparison between these two mapping sets are shown in Table 6, which lists the total numbers of mappings in 4 buckets: \u2022 Same: A Freebase id maps to a same Wikidata id. \u2022 Different: A Freebase id maps to different Wikidata\nids. \u2022 DAWT Only: A Freebase id only maps to a Wikidata\nid in DAWT.\n3https://developers.google.com/freebase# freebase-wikidata-mappings\n\u2022 Google Only: A Freebase id only maps to a Wikidata id in Google.\nNote that the 24,638 different mappings are mainly caused by multiple Wikidata ids mapping to a same entity. For example, Freebase id 01159r maps to Q6110357 in DAWT and Q7355420 in Google, and both Q6110357 and Q7355420 represent the town Rockland in Wisconsin."}, {"heading": "6.5 Entity Embeddings", "text": "There have been many efforts on learning word embeddings, i.e., vector space representations of words [6, 14, 15]. Such representations are very useful in many tasks, such as word analogy, word similarity, and named entity recognition. Recently, Pennington et al. [17] proposed a model, GloVe, which learns word embeddings with both global matrix factorization and local context windowing. They showed that obtained embeddings captured rich semantic information and performed well in the aforementioned tasks.\nThere are several word-vector data sets available on GloVe\u2019s website4. However, they only contain embeddings of individual words and thus have several limitations: \u2022 Language dependent \u2022 Missing entities that cannot be represented by a sin-\ngle word \u2022 May not properly represent ambiguous words, such\nas \"apple\", which can be either the fruit or the technology company.\nTo facilitate research in this direction, we provide an entityembedding data set that overcomes the above limitations. This date set contains embeddings of Wiki entities with 3 different vector sizes: 50, 300, and 1000. They were generated with the GloVe model via the following steps:\n1. Represent each Wiki document across all languages as a list of entities: There are about 2.2B total entities and 1.8M unique entities in these documents. 2. Use the open source GloVe code5 to process these documents: For each vector size, we ran 300 iterations on a GPU box with 24 cores and 60G dedicated memory. Other runtime configurations were the same as default. In particular, we: \u2022 Truncate entities with total count < 5 \u2022 Set window size to be 15\nExecution time was roughly proportional to the vector size. It took about 25 minutes to run 1 iteration when size is 1000. Among the 1.8 M unique entities, the GloVe model were able to generate embeddings for about 1.6 M entities. To evaluate these embeddings, we compared them with one of the GloVe word embeddings, which was also gen-\n4http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ 5https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe\nerated from Wikipedia data6, on the word/entity analogy task. This task is commonly used to evaluate embeddings [14, 15, 17] by answering the following question: Given word/entity X, Y, and Z, what is the word/entity that is similar to Z in the same sense as Y is similar to X? For example, given word \"Athens\", \"Greece\", and \"Paris\", the right answer is \"France\".\nHere we used the test data provided by [14]7. This test set contains 5 semantic and 9 syntactic relation types. For each word in this data set, we find the corresponding Freebase id using the mapping between Freebase ids and english Wikidata urls. Thus, we obtain a test set that contains relations between entities. Note that when we could not find a Freebase id for a word, all the associated relations were removed from the test set.\nWe then ran the test on the 5 semantic types. Syntactic relations were excluded from this test because most of the time the task is trivial when one can correctly link words to entities. For example, when both \"bird\" and \"birds\" are linked to entity 015p6-Bird, and \"cat\" and \"cats\" are linked to entity 01yrx-Cat, the analogy among them is obvious without examining the underlining embeddings.\nTable 7 shows the accuracy (in %) obtained from our entity embeddings with vector sizes of 50, 300, and 1000. In comparison, it also shows the accuracy from GloVe word embeddings with vector sizes of 50, 100, 200, and 300. Entity embeddings have better performance with vector size of 50. As we increase vector size, word embeddings perform significantly better and outperform entity embeddings when the vector size is 200 or higher. The degraded performance of entity embeddings may due to less training data, since our entity embeddings were obtained from 2.2B tokens, where GloVe\u2019s word embeddings were obtained from 6B tokens."}, {"heading": "7. APPLICATIONS OF THE DATASET", "text": "As discussed earlier, the DAWT and other derived datasets that we have described in this paper have several applications for the NLP and IR communities.

For this, the Mention Occurrence, Entity Occurrence and the Mention To Entity Co-occurrence datasets described in Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 are extremely useful. For instance, the raw mention occurrence counts and probabilities can be stored in a dictionary and can be used to extract the mentions in a document. Furthermore, the mention occurrence count of a mention Mi and its co-occurrence count with an entity Ej can be used to calculate the prior probability of the mention mapping to that entity:\ncount(Mi \u2192 Ej) count(Mi)\nThis can be used to determine the candidate entities for a mention from our KB."}, {"heading": "7.2 Entity Disambiguation and Linking (EDL)", "text": "This task involves linking the mention to its correct KB entity. For each mention, there may be several candidate entities with prior probabilities as calculated in NER. In addition, other features derived from these datasets can include entity co-occurrences, entity word2vec similarity and lexical similarity between the mention and the entity surface form. These features can be used to train a supervised learning algorithm to link the mention to the correct disambiguated entity among all the candidate entities as done in [1]. The approach used in [1] employs several such context dependent and independent features and has a precision of 63%, recall of 87% and an F-score of 73%."}, {"heading": "8. ACCESSING THE DATASET", "text": "The DAWT and derived datasets discussed in paper are available for download at this page: https://github.com/ klout/opendata/tree/master/wiki_annotation. The DAWT dataset was generated using Wikipedia Data Dumps from January 20th 2017. Statistics regarding the data set are shown in Table 1."}, {"heading": "9. RELATED WORK", "text": "While a lot of works have focused on building and opening such datasets, very few have addressed all the challenges and constraints that we mentioned in Section 2. Spitkovsky and Chang [22] opened a cross-lingual dictionary (of English Wikipedia Articles) containing 175,100,788 mentions linking to 7,560,141 entities. This dataset, though extremely valuable, represents mention - entity mappings across a mixture of all languages which makes it harder to use for a specific language. In addition, this work used raw counts that, although useful, lack mention context (such as preceding and succeeding tokens etc.) which have a big\nimpact while performing EDL. The Freebase annotations of the ClueWeb corpora dataset8 dataset contains 647 million English web pages with an average of 13 entities annotated per document and 456 million documents having at least 1 entity annotated. It does not support multiple languages.\nAnother related technique for generating such dictionaries is Wikification [12, 16, 4] where mentions in Wikipedia pages are linked to the disambiguated entities\u2019 Wikipedia pages. Such techniques rely on a local or global approach. A local approach involves linking observed entities using only their local context eg. by comparing the relatedness of candidate Wiki articles with the mentions [5, 7, 19] while in global approach entities across the entire document are disambiguated together using document context, thus, ensuring consistency of entities across the document [9, 18]. Most recently Cai et al. [3] achieved 89.97% precision and 76.43% recall, using an iterative algorithm that leverages link graph, link distributions, and a noun phrase extractor.\nAlthough the problem of entity linking has been well studied for English, it has still not been explored for other languages. McNamee et al. [11] introduced the problem of cross-language entity linking. The main challenge here is that state-of-the-art part-of-speech taggers perform much better on English than on other languages. In addition, both Wikipedia and Freebase have significantly higher quality and coverage of English compared to any other language."}, {"heading": "10. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "In this work, we opened up the DAWT dataset - Densely Annotated Wikipedia Texts across multiple languages. The annotations include labeled text mentions mapping to entities (represented by their Freebase machine ids) as well as the type of the entity. The data set contains total of 13.6M articles, 5.0B tokens, 13.8M mention entity co-occurrences. DAWT contains 4.8 times more anchor text to entity links than originally present in the Wikipedia markup. Moreover, it spans several languages including English, Spanish, Italian, German, French and Arabic. We also presented the methodology used to generate the dataset which enriched Wikipedia markup in order to increase number of links. In addition to the main dataset, we opened up several derived datasets for mention occurrence counts, entity occurrence counts, mention entity co-occurrence counts, entity word2vec as well as mappings between Freebase ids and Wikidata item ids. We also discussed two applications of these datasets and hope that opening them up would prove useful for the NLPand IR communities as well as facilitate multi-lingual research.\n8http://lemurproject.org/clueweb09/FACC1/\nIn the future, we plan to improve the algorithm that we used for generating DAWT. Also, we plan to migrate from using Freebase ids in our KB to Wikidata item ids."}, {"heading": "11. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] P. Bhargava, N. Spasojevic, and G.

DAWT contains 4.8 times more anchor text to entity links than originally present in the Wikipedia markup. Moreover, it spans several languages including English, Spanish, Italian, German, French and Arabic. We also present the methodology used to generate the dataset which enriches Wikipedia markup in order to increase number of links. In addition to the main dataset, we open up several derived datasets including mention entity co-occurrence counts and entity embeddings, as well as mappings between Freebase ids and Wikidata item ids. We also discuss two applications of these datasets and hope that opening them up would prove useful for the Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval communities, as well as facilitate multi-lingual research.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
