In a world where a system (the binary distribution) has no distribution or an intermediate, this dependence is found to be the most significant finding.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe evidence shows that exchangeability can be considered as an integral part of choice making. It is a sign of the nature of choice, which includes the ability to determine the appropriate outcome. It is the fundamental principle of choice in the distribution of choice. When it is possible to say that choice has the highest likelihood of success in our knowledge, it is used in the sense of being able to choose the appropriate outcome.\nOne of the key problems with this understanding of the distribution of choice is the non-reinforcing effects of choice. It also relates to the importance of choice on choice making. The non-reinforcing effects are likely to lead to multiple interactions of different types of choices. A selection may lead to multiple problems in choice, with many competing outcomes.\nA selection may lead to multiple problems in choice, with many competing outcomes.\nA selection may lead to multiple problems in choice, with many competing outcomes.

Introduction", "text": "In this paper, we study how to model exchangeability, a structural assessment for uncertainty models that is important for inference purposes, in the framework of choice functions, an interesting approach to modelling uncertainty. This work builds on the work about exchangeability for lower previsions (see de Cooman et al. (2009)) and exchangeability for sets of desirable gambles (see de Cooman and Quaeghebeur (2012)).\nChoice functions are related to the fundamental problem in decision theory: how to make a choice from within a set of available options. In their book, von Neumann and Morgenstern (1972) provide an axiomatisation of choice based on pairwise comparison between the options. Later on, Rubin (1987) generalised that idea and proposed a theory of choice functions based on choice between more than two elements. One of the aspects in Rubin (1987)\u2019s theory is that, between any pair of options, the agent either prefers one of them, or he is indifferent between them, so two options can never be incomparable. However, for instance when the information available does not allow for a complete comparison of the options, the agent may be undecided between two options without being indifferent between them; this will for instance typically be the case when there is no relevant information available at all. This is one of the motivations for a theory of imprecise probabilities (see Walley (1991)), where incomparability and indifference are distinguished. Kadane et al. (2004) and Seidenfeld et al. (2010) generalise the axioms in Rubin (1987) to allow for incomparability.\nExchangeability is a structural assessment on a sequence of uncertain variables. Loosely speaking, making a judgement of exchangeability means that the order in which the variables are observed is considered irrelevant. This irrelevancy will be modelled through an indifference assessment. The first detailed study of exchangeability was de Finetti (1937). For a brief historical overview, we refer to Ref. (de Cooman and Quaeghebeur, 2012, Sec. 1).\nIn Sec. 2, we will recall the necessary tools for modelling indifference with choice functions. Next, in Sec. 3, we will derive de Finetti-like Representation Theorems for a finite sequence that is exchangeable. We will take this one step further in Sec. 4, where we consider a countable sequence and derive a representation theorem for such sequences. Because it will be useful to compare\nwith de Cooman and Quaeghebeur (2012), we will also provide representation theorems for sets of desirable gambles."}, {"heading": "2. Choice functions, desirability and indifference", "text": "The material in this section is based on (Van Camp et al., 2017, Sec. 5). Consider a real vector space V , provided with the vector addition and scalar multiplication. Elements u of V are intended as abstract representations of options amongst which a subject can express his preferences, by specifying, as we will see below, choice functions. Mostly, options will be real-valued maps on the possibility space, interpreted as uncertain rewards, and therefore also called gambles. The set of all gambles on the possibility space X will be denoted as L(X). Given any subset O of V , we will define the linear hull span(O) \u2236= {\u2211nk=1\u03bbkuk \u2236 n \u2208 N,\u03bbk \u2208 R,uk \u2208 O} \u2286 V and the positive hull posi(O) \u2236= {\u2211nk=1\u03bbkuk \u2236 n \u2208N,\u03bbk \u2208R>0,uk \u2208O} \u2286 span(O), where R>0 is the set of all (strictly) positive real numbers. A subset O of V is called a convex cone if it is closed under positive finite linear combinations, i.e. if posi(O) = O. A convex cone K is called proper if K\u2229\u2212K = {0}. With any proper convex cone K \u2286V , we associate an ordering \u2aafK on V as follows: u \u2aafK v\u21d4 v\u2212u \u2208 K for any u and v in V . For any u and v in V , we write u \u227aK v if u \u2aafK v and u \u2260 v. We collect all the options u for which 0 \u227aK u in V\u227b0. When we work with gambles, then V = L(X) and the ordering will be the standard one \u2264, given by f \u2264 g\u21d4(\u2200x \u2208 X) f (x) \u2264 g(x). We collect the positive gambles\u2014gambles f for which 0 < f\u2014in L(X)>0. Then \u2264 corresponds to \u2aafK where we let K \u2236= L(X)>0\u222a{0}.\nWe denote by Q(V) the set of all non-empty finite subsets of V . Elements of Q(V) are the option sets amongst which a subject can choose his preferred options.\nA choice function C on V is a map C\u2236Q\u2192Q\u222a{\u2205}\u2236O \u21a6C(O) such that C(O) \u2286O. Not every such map represents a rational belief; only the coherent choice functions do. We call a choice function C on V coherent1 if, for all O, O1 and O2 in Q(V), all u and v in V , and all \u03bb in R>0: C1. C(O) \u2260 \u2205; C2. if u \u227a v then {v} =C({u,v}); C3. a. ifC(O2) \u2286O2\u2216O1 and O1 \u2286O2 \u2286O then C(O) \u2286O\u2216O1; b. ifC(O2) \u2286O1 and O \u2286O2\u2216O1 then C(O2\u2216O) \u2286O1; C4. a. if O1 \u2286C(O2) then \u03bbO1 \u2286C(\u03bbO2);\nb. if O1 \u2286C(O2) then O1+{u} \u2286C(O2+{u}).\nConsider two isomorphic vector spaces V and W , a linear order isomorphism \u03c6 between V and W , and a choice function C on V . Define the choice function C\u2032 onW as u \u2208C(O)\u21d4 \u03c6(u) \u2208C\u2032(\u03c6(O)) for all O in Q(V) and u in O. Then, because \u03c6 is a bijection, C satisfies Axioms C1 and C3 if and only if C\u2032 does; furthermore, because \u03c6 is order preserving, C satisfies Axiom C2 if and only if C \u2032 does; and finally, because \u03c6 is linear,C satisfies Axiom C4 if and only ifC \u2032 does: such isomorphisms preserve coherence.\nA set of desirable options (or gambles) D \u2286V is essentially the restriction to pairwise comparison of a choice function: D = {u \u2208 V \u2216{0} \u2236 {u} =C({0,u})}. We call D coherent if 0 \u2209 D, V\u227b0 \u2286 D, u \u2208D\u21d2 \u03bbu \u2208D, and u,v \u2208D\u21d2 u+v \u2208D for all u and v in V and \u03bb in R>0. D is coherent if the choice function C it is based on, is coherent.\nSince, as we will see, an exchangeability assessment amounts to a specific indifference assessment, we recall how to model an indifference assessment. For more information, we refer\n1. Our rationality axioms are based on those in Seidenfeld et al. (2010), slightly modified for use with sets of desirable\ngambles.\nto (Van Camp et al., 2017, Sec. 5). Next to C(O)\u2014the options that the agent strictly prefers from O\u2014or D\u2014the options that he strictly prefers to 0\u2014we consider the options that the agent considers to be equivalent to the zero option I \u2286 V . We call I coherent if, for all u and v in V and \u03bb in R: I1. 0 \u2208 I; I2. if u \u2208 V\u227b0\u222aV\u227a0 then u \u2209 I; I3. if u \u2208 I then \u03bbu \u2208 I; I4. if u,v \u2208 I then u+v \u2208 I. We collect all options that are indifferent to an option u in V into the equivalence class [u] \u2236= {v \u2208 V \u2236 v\u2212u \u2208 I} = {u}+ I. The set of all these equivalence classes is the quotient space V/I \u2236= {[u] \u2236 u \u2208 V}, being a linear space itself. We provide it with the natural ordering inherited from V: u\u0303 \u2aaf v\u0303\u21d4 (\u2203u \u2208 u\u0303,v \u2208 v\u0303)u \u2aaf v for all u\u0303 and v\u0303 in V/I.\nConsider any coherent set of indifferent options I. A choice functionC is then called compatible with I if there is some representing choice function C\u2032 on V/I such that C(O) = {u \u2208 O \u2236 [u] \u2208 C\u2032(O/I)} for all O in Q(V). In that case, C\u2032 is uniquely determined by C\u2032(O/I) =C(O)/I for all O in Q(V), and, moreover, C is coherent if and only if C\u2032 is. Equivalently, we find the following useful characterisation: C is compatible with I if and only if 0 \u2208C(O)\u21d4 u \u2208C(O) for all u in I and O \u2287 {0,u} in Q(V), which corresponds to the definition of indifference in Ref. Seidenfeld (1988).\nFor desirability, compatibility with a coherent set of indifferent options I is defined as follows. We call a set of desirable gambles D compatible with I if D+I \u2286D, and this is equivalent toD =\u22c3D\u2032 where D\u2032 \u2286 V/I is the representing set of desirable options. In that case, D\u2032 is uniquely given by D\u2032 =D/I, and, moreover, D is coherent if and only if D\u2032 is."}, {"heading": "3. Finite exchangeability", "text": "Consider n \u2208N uncertain variables X1, . . . , Xn taking values in a non-empty set X . The possibility space of the uncertain sequence (X1, . . . ,Xn) is X n .\nWe denote by x = (x1, . . . ,xn) an arbitrary element of X n . For any n in Nwe call Pn the group of all permutations \u03c0 of the index set {1, . . . ,n}. There are \u2223Pn \u2223 = n! such permutations. With any such permutation \u03c0, we associate a permutation of X n , also denoted by \u03c0, and defined by (\u03c0x)k \u2236= x\u03c0(k) for every k in {1, . . . ,n}, or in other words, \u03c0(x1, . . . ,xn) = (x\u03c0(1), . . . ,x\u03c0(n)). Similarly, we lift \u03c0 to a permutation \u03c0t on L(X n) by letting \u03c0t f = f \u25cb\u03c0, so (\u03c0t f )(x) \u2236= f (\u03c0x) for all x in X n . Observe that \u03c0t is a linear permutation of the vector space L(X n) of all gambles on X n .\nIf a subject assesses that the sequence of variables X inX n is exchangeable, this means precisely that he is indifferent between any gamble f on X n and its permuted variant \u03c0t f , for any \u03c0 in Pn . This leads us to the following proposal for the corresponding set of indifferent gambles:\nIPn \u2236= span{ f \u2212\u03c0t f \u2236 f \u2208L(X n),\u03c0 \u2208Pn}. Definition 1 A choice function C on L(X n) is called (finitely) exchangeable if it is compatible with IPn . Similarly, a set of desirable gambles D \u2286 L(X n) is called (finitely) exchangeable if it is compatible with IPn .\nOf course, so far, we do not yet know whether this notion of exchangeability is well-defined: indeed, we do not know yet whether IPn is a coherent set of indifferent gambles. In the next section, we will show that this is indeed the case."}, {"heading": "3.1 Count vectors", "text": "In this section, we will provide the tools necessary to prove that IPn is a coherent set of indifferent gambles. In de Cooman et al. (2009) and de Cooman and Quaeghebeur (2012), all the maps we use here are defined.\nThe permutation invariant atoms [x] \u2236= {\u03c0x \u2236 x \u2208 X n}, x in X n are the smallest permutation invariant subsets of X n . We introduce the counting map T \u2236X n \u2192 N n \u2236x \u21a6 T (x) where T (x) is called the count vector of x. It is the X -tuple with components Tz(x) \u2236= \u2223{k \u2208 {1, . . . ,n} \u2236 xk = z}\u2223 for all z in X , so Tz is the number of times that z occurs in the sequence x1, . . . , xn . The range of T\u2014the set N n\u2014is called the set of possible count vectors and is given by\nN n \u2236= {m \u2208 ZX\u22650 \u2236 \u2211 x\u2208X mx = n}. Remark that applying any permutation to x leaves its result under the counting map unchanged: T (x) = T (\u03c0x) for al x in X n and \u03c0 in Pn . For any x in X n , if m = T (x) then [x] = {y \u2208X n \u2236 T (y) =m}, so the permutation invariant atom [x] is completely determined by the count vector m of all its elements, and is therefore also denoted by [T (x)] = [m]. Remark that {[m] \u2236m \u2208N n} partitions X n into disjoint parts with constant count vectors, and that \u2223[m]\u2223 = (n\nm ) \u2236= N! \u220fz\u2208X mz! .\nIn order to extend the idea of the count vectors for use with gambles, let us define the set of all permutation invariant gambles as LPn(X n) \u2236= { f \u2208L(X n) \u2236 (\u2200\u03c0 \u2208Pn)\u03c0t f = f} \u2286L(X n), and a special transformation invPn of the linear space L(X n)\ninvPn \u2236L(X n)\u2192L(X n)\u2236 f \u21a6 invPn ( f ) \u2236= 1 N! \u2211 \u03c0\u2208Pn \u03c0t f , (1)\nwhich, as we will see, is closely linked with LPn(X n) (see de Cooman and Quaeghebeur (2012); Van Camp et al. (2017)). Proposition 2 invPn is a linear transformation of L(X n), and (i) invPn \u25cb\u03c0 t = invPn = \u03c0 t \u25cb invPn for all \u03c0 in P;\n(ii) invPn \u25cb invPn = invPn ; (iii) kern(invPn ) = IPn ; (iv) rng(invPn ) =LPn(X n).\nSo we see that invPn is a linear projection operator that maps any gamble to a permutation invariant counterpart.\nAs shown by de Cooman and Quaeghebeur (2012), the linear projection operator invPn renders a gamble insensitive to permutation by replacing it with the uniform average of all its permutations. As a result, it assumes the same value for all gambles that can be related to each other through some permutation: invPn( f ) = invPn (g) if f = \u03c0tg for some \u03c0 in Pn , for all f and g in L(X n). Furthermore, for any f in L(X n), its transformation invPn ( f ) is permutation invariant and therefore constant on the permutation invariant atoms [m]: (invPn ( f ))(x) = (invPn ( f ))(y) if [x] = [y], for all x and y in X n . We can use the properties of invPn to prove that IPn is suitable for the definition of exchangeability.\nProposition 3 Consider any n in N. Then IPn is a coherent set of indifferent gambles.\nSince IPn is coherent, exchangeability is well-defined, and by the discussion in Sec. 2, the representing choice function C\u2032 is defined on L(X n)/IPn , and, similarly, the representing set of desirable gambles D\u2032 \u2286 L(X n)/IPn . So we shall focus on the quotient space and its elements, exchangeable equivalent classes of gambles.\nBut before we do that, it will pay to further explore the notions we have introduced thus far.\nConsider any f in L(X n). What is the constant value that invPn ( f ) assumes on a permutation invariant atom [m]? To answer this question, consider any x in [m], then (invPn ( f ))(x) = 1 n!\u2211\u03c0\u2208Pn f (\u03c0x) = 1n! \u2223Pn \u2223\u2223[m]\u2223\u2211y\u2208{\u03c0x\u2236\u03c0\u2208Pn} f (y) = 1(n m )\u2211y\u2208[x] f (y) = 1(n m )\u2211y\u2208[m] f (y), whence\ninvPn = \u2211 m\u2208N n Hn(\u22c5\u2223m)I[m], (2) where Hn(\u22c5\u2223m) is the linear expectation operator associated with the uniform distribution on the invariant atom [m]:\nHn( f \u2223m) \u2236= 1(n m ) \u2211y\u2208[m] f (y) for all f in L(X n) and m in N n . (3) It characterises a (multivariate) hyper-geometric distribution (see Ref. Johnson et al. (1997)), associated with random sampling without replacement from an urn with n balls of types X , whose composition is characterised by the count vector m.\nThe result of applying a gamble f on X n to the map Hn \u2236L(X n)\u2192L(N n)\u2236 f \u21a6Hn( f ) \u2236=Hn( f \u2223\u22c5) (4)\nis the gamble Hn( f ) on N n that assumes the value 1(n m )\u2211y\u2208[m] f (y) for every m in N n ."}, {"heading": "3.2 Exchangeable equivalent classes of gambles", "text": "We already know that exchangeable choice functions are represented by choice functions on the quotient space L(X n)/IPn , and similar for sets of desirable gambles. In the quest for an elegant representation theorem, we thus need to focus on the quotient space L(X n)/IPn and its elements, which are exchangeable equivalent classes of gambles.\nIn this section we investigate how the representation of permutation invariant gambles helps us find a representation for exchangeable choice functions. To that end, the representation will use equivalence classes [ f ] \u2236= { f}+ IPn of gambles, for any f in L(X n). Recall that the quotient spaceL(X n)/IPn \u2236= {[ f ] \u2236 f \u2208L(X n)} is a linear space itself, with additive identity [0] = IPn , and therefore any element f\u0303 of L(X n)/IPn is invariant under addition of IPn : f\u0303 + IPn = f\u0303 . Elements of L(X n)/IPn will be generically denoted as f\u0303 or g\u0303.\nProposition 4 Consider any f and g in L(X n). Then [ f ] = [g] if and only if Hn( f ) =Hn(g) Therefore, it makes sense to introduce the map H\u0303n :\nH\u0303n \u2236L(X n)/IPn \u2192L(N n)\u2236 f\u0303 \u21a6Hn( f ) for any f in f\u0303 . (5)\nThen Proposition 4 guarantees that elements of L(X n)/IPn are characterised using H\u0303n , in the sense that f\u0303 = { f \u2208L(X n) \u2236Hn( f ) = H\u0303n( f\u0303 )} for all f\u0303 in L(X n)/IPn .\nThe map H\u0303n takes as input an equivalence class of gambles, and maps it to some representing\ngamble on the count vectors. It will be useful later on to consider some converse map H\u0303\u22121n :\nH\u0303\u22121n \u2236L(N n)\u2192L(X n)/IPn \u2236 f \u21a6 [ \u2211 m\u2208N n f (m)I[m]]. (6) Proposition 5 The maps H\u0303n as defined in Eq. (5) and H\u0303 \u22121 n as defined in Eq. (6) are each other\u2019s inverses. The importance of Prop. 5 lies in the fact that now, H\u0303n is a bijection between L(X n)/IPn andL(N n), and therefore, exchangeable equivalence classes of gambles are in a one-to-one correspondence with gambles on count vectors.\nL(X n) L(N n)\nL(X n)/IPn\nHn\n[\u22c5] H\u0303n\nThe commuting diagram shows the surjections [\u22c5]\u2236L(X n)\u2192L(X n)/IPn \u2236 f \u21a6 [ f ] and Hn (indicated with a single arrow), and the bijection H\u0303n (indicated with a double arrow). Since the representing choice functionC\u2032 is defined fromC through [\u22c5]\u2014working point-wise on sets\u2014this already suggests thatC\u2032 can be transformed into a choice function on L(N n). To prove that they preserve coherence, there is only one missing link: the ordering between L(X n)/IPn and L(N n) should be preserved.\nTherefore, to define the ordering \u2aaf on L(X n)/IPn , as usual, we let \u2aaf be inherited by the ordering \u2264 on L(X n): f\u0303 \u2aaf g\u0303\u21d4(\u2203 f \u2208 f\u0303 ,\u2203g \u2208 g\u0303) f \u2264 g (7) for all f\u0303 and g\u0303 in L(X n)/IPn , turning L(X n)/IPn into an ordered linear space. It turns out that this vector ordering on L(X n)/IPn can be represented elegantly using H\u0303n : Proposition 6 Consider any f\u0303 and g\u0303 in L(X n)/IPn , then f\u0303 \u2aaf g\u0303 if and only if H\u0303n( f\u0303 ) \u2264 H\u0303n(g\u0303).\nProps. 5 and 6 imply that Hn is a linear order isomorphism."}, {"heading": "3.3 A representation theorem", "text": "Now that we have found a linear order isomorphism H\u0303n between L(X n)/IPn and L(N n), we are ready to represent coherent and exchangeable choice functions.

So an exchangeable choice function C essentially represents preferences between urns with n balls of types X with different compositions m: the choice C(O) between the gambles in O is based upon the composition m."}, {"heading": "3.4 Finite representation in terms of polynomials", "text": "In Sec. 4, we will prove a similar representation theorem for infinite sequences. Since it no longer makes sense to count in such sequences, we first need to find a equivalent representation theorem in terms of something that does not depend on counts. More specifically, we need, for every n in N another order-isomorphic linear space to L(X n)/IPn , that allows for embedding: the linear space for n1 < n2 must be a subspace of the one for n2.\nAll the maps we use here have been introduced by de Cooman et al. (2009). Moreover, we use their idea and work with polynomials on the X -simplex \u03a3X \u2236= {\u03b8 \u2208 RX \u2236 \u03b8 \u2265 0,\u2211x\u2208X \u03b8x = 1}. We consider the special subset V(\u03a3X ) of L(\u03a3X ): V(\u03a3X ) are the polynomial gambles h on \u03a3X , which are those gambles that are the restriction to \u03a3X of a multivariate polynomial p on R X , in the sense that h(\u03b8) = p(\u03b8) for all \u03b8 in \u03a3X . We call p then a representation of h. It will be useful to introduce a notation for polynomial gambles with fixed degree n in N: Vn(\u03a3X ) is the collection of all polynomial gambles that have at least one representation whose degree is not bigger than n. Both V(\u03a3X ) and Vn(\u03a3X ) are linear subspaces of L(\u03a3X ), and, as wanted, for n1 < n2, Vn1(\u03a3X ) is a subspace of Vn2(\u03a3X ).\nSome special polynomial gambles are the Bernstein gambles:\nDefinition 8 (Bernstein gambles) Consider any n in N and any m in N n . Define the Bernstein basis polynomial Bm on R\nX as Bm(\u03b8) \u2236= (nm)\u220fx\u2208X \u03b8mxx for all \u03b8 in RX . The restriction to \u03a3X is called a Bernstein gamble, which we also denote as Bm.\nAs shown in de Cooman and Quaeghebeur (2012); De Bock et al. (2016), the set of all Bernstein gambles forms a basis of the linear space Vn(\u03a3X ): Proposition 9 Consider any n in N. The set of Bernstein gambles {Bm \u2236m \u2208N n} constitutes a basis of the linear space Vn(\u03a3X ).\nAs we have seen, we need linear order isomorphisms to preserve coherence. So we wonder whether there is one between L(X n)/IPn and Vn(\u03a3X ). In Sec. 3.2 we have seen that there is one between L(X n)/IPn and L(N n), namely H\u0303n . Therefore, it suffices to find one between L(N n) and Vn(\u03a3X ). Consider the map\nCoMn \u2236L(N n)\u2192 Vn(\u03a3X )\u2236r\u21a6 \u2211 m\u2208N n r(m)Bm. (8) Before we can establish that CoMn is a linear order isomorphism, we need to provide the linear space Vn(\u03a3X ) with an order \u2aafnB . We use the proper cone {0}\u222aposi({Bm \u2236 m \u2208 N n}) to define the order \u2aafnB:\nh1 \u2aaf n B h2 \u21d4 h2\u2212h1 \u2208 {0}\u222aposi({Bm \u2236m \u2208 N n}) for all h1 and h2 in Vn(\u03a3X ).\nThe following proposition is shown in de Cooman and Quaeghebeur (2012).\nProposition 10 Consider any n in N. Then the map CoMn is a linear order isomorphism between the ordered linear spaces L(N n) and Vn(\u03a3X ). The linear order isomorphism CoMn helps us to define a linear order isomorphism between the linear spaces L(X n) and Vn(\u03a3X ), a final tool needed for a representation theorem in terms of polynomial gambles. Indeed, consider for the map Mn \u2236=CoMn \u25cbHn :\nMn \u2236L(X n)\u2192 Vn(\u03a3X )\u2236 f \u21a6Mn( f \u2223\u03b8), where Mn( f \u2223\u03b8) \u2236=\u2211m\u2208N n \u2211y\u2208[m] f (y)\u220fx\u2208X \u03b8mxx is the expectation of f associated with the multinomial distribution whose parameters are n and \u03b8 .

There is an immediate connection between Mn and M\u0303n : they are both compositions of two linear order isomorphisms, and are therefore linear order isomorphisms themselves. Due to Prop. 4, considering any f\u0303 in L(X n)/IPn , Mn is constant on f\u0303 , and the value it takes on any element of f\u0303 is exactly M\u0303n( f\u0303 ).\nL(X n)\nL(N n) Vn(\u03a3X )\nL(X n)/IPn\nHn Mn\n[\u22c5]\nCoMn\nM\u0303nH\u0303n\nThe commuting diagram shows the surjections [\u22c5], Hn and Mn , and the bijections H\u0303n , M\u0303n and CoMn . It shows that both L(N n) and Vn(\u03a3X ) are order-isomorphic to L(X n)/IPn , so they are both suitable to define a representing choice function on. In Theorem 7, we used the space L(N n). Here, we will use the other equivalent space Vn(\u03a3X ). Theorem 11 (Finite Representation) Consider any choice function C on L(X n).

Conclusion", "text": "We studied exchangeability and we have found counterparts to de Finetti\u2019s finite and countable representation results, in the general setting of choice functions. We have shown that an exchangeability assessment is a particular indifference assessment, where we identified the set of indifferent options. The main idea that made (finite) representation possible is the linear order isomorphism H\u0303\u22121n between the quotient space and the set of gambles on count vectors, indicating that (finitely) exchangeable choice functions can be represented by a choice function that essentially represents preferences between urns with n balls of types X with different compositions m. Alternatively, for the countable case, we have shown that there is a polynomial representation.\nChoice functions form a belief structure (see Van Camp et al. (2017)). Therefore, any infimum of coherent choice functions is a coherent choice function itself. Since any infimum of choice functions compatible with some fixed set of indifferent options I, is compatible with I as well (see Van Camp et al. (2017)), our results indicate that, using choice functions, it is conceptually easy to reason about exchangeable sequences: infima of exchangeable and coherent choice functions will be exchangeable and coherent as well.\nA possible future goal is to investigate how exchangeability behaves under updating. It is shown, in de Cooman and Quaeghebeur (2012), that, for exchangeable sets of desirable gambles, updating can be done directly for the representing set of desirable gambles in the count space.

Axioms I3 and I4 are satisfied because IPn is a linear span.\nProof [Proof of Prop. 4] Infer the following equivalences. Start with [ f ] = [g], what, due to the definition of equivalence classes, is equivalent to f +h1 = g+h2, and equivalently, g\u2212 f = h1\u2212h2, for some h1 and h2 in IPn . In turn, since IPn is a linear space, that is equivalent to g\u2212 f \u2208 IPn . Because ker(invPn ) = IPn [by Proposition 2(iii)], we find equivalently that invPn (g\u2212 f ) = 0, and, due to the linearity of invPn , equivalently invPn ( f ) = invPn(g). Use Lemma 20 to find that, indeed, equivalently Hn( f ) =Hn(g).\nLemma 20 Consider any f and g in L(X n). Then invPn ( f ) = invPn(g) if and only if Hn( f ) = Hn(g). Proof [Proof of Lemma 20] Infer the following equivalences. Start with invPn ( f ) = invPn(g), what, by Eq. (2), is equivalent to \u2211m\u2208N n Hn( f \u2223m)I[m] =\u2211m\u2208N n Hn(g\u2223m)I[m]. Equivalently, we find that Hn( f \u2223m) =Hn(g\u2223m) for all m in N n . In turn, by Eq. (4), that is equivalent to Hn( f ) =Hn(g). Proof [Proof of Prop. 5] This proof is structured as follows: we show that (i) H\u0303\u22121n \u25cbH\u0303n = idL(X n)/IPn , and (ii) H\u0303n \u25cb H\u0303\u22121n = idL(N n), together implying that H\u0303n and H\u0303 \u22121 n are each other\u2019s inverses.\nFor (i), consider any f\u0303 in L(X n)/IPn .

(5), indeed H\u0303n( f\u0303 ) \u2264 H\u0303n(g\u0303). For sufficiency, assume that H\u0303n( f\u0303 ) \u2264 H\u0303n(g\u0303). Then, by Eq. (5) and Prop. 4, Hn( f ) \u2264Hn(g) for all f in f\u0303 and g in g\u0303. Consider any f in f\u0303 and g in g\u0303 and let f \u2032 \u2236= invPn( f ) and g\u2032 \u2236= invPn (g). Then invPn( f \u2032) = invPn ( f ) and invPn(g\u2032) = invPn(g) by Prop. 2(ii), so Lemma 20 and Prop. 4 together imply that f \u2032 \u2208 f\u0303 and g\u2032 \u2208 f\u0303 , so Hn( f \u2032) \u2264 Hn(g\u2032).

But f \u2032 and g\u2032 are constant on every [m], so f \u2032(y) \u2264 g\u2032(y) for every y in [m] and every m in N n . Then f \u2032 \u2264 g\u2032, and therefore indeed f\u0303 \u2aaf g\u0303.

Since f \u2208 [ f ], use Prop. 4 and Eq. (5) to infer that H\u0303n([ f ]) =Hn( f ). Similarly, infer that H\u0303n(O/IPn )= {H\u0303n([g]) \u2236 g \u2208O} = {Hn(g) \u2236 g \u2208O}=Hn(O), so [ f ] \u2208C\u2032(O/IPn )\u21d4Hn( f ) \u2208 C\u0303(Hn(O)). Then indeed\nC(O) = { f \u2208O \u2236Hn( f ) \u2208 C\u0303(Hn(O))} for all O in Q(L(X n)). To show that C\u0303 is unique, use that C\u2032 is unique and H\u0303n is a bijection to infer that C\u0303 is unique too.\nFor the second statement, consider any O inQ(L(X n)) and infer, using the definition of C\u0303, that C\u0303(H\u0303n(O/IPn)) = H\u0303n(C\u2032(O/IPn )) , and therefore C\u0303(Hn(O)) = H\u0303n(C\u2032(O/IPn)). Since C\u2032 is given by C\u2032(O/IPn) =C(O)/IPn , we find H\u0303n(C\u2032(O/IPn)) = H\u0303n(C(O)/IPn) = Hn(C(O)), and therefore indeed C\u0303(Hn(O)) =Hn(C(O)).\nFor the third statement, by the compatibility with IPn guarantees that C is coherent if and only if C\u2032 on L(X n)/IPn is coherent. But since C\u0303 is defined from C\u2032 using the linear order isomorphism Hn , we have immediately that C\u0303 is coherent if and only if C \u2032 is coherent. Therefore indeed C is coherent if and only if C\u0303 is coherent.\nWe now turn to the representation for sets of desirable gambles. Since D is compatible with IPn , there is some representing set of desirable gambles D \u2032 \u2286 L(X n)/IPn such that D =\u22c3D\u2032. Using the linear order isomorphism H\u0303n we can transform D \u2032 to D\u0303 \u2236= H\u0303n(D\u2032) on the isomorphic space L(N n). Then D\u2032 = H\u0303\u22121n (D\u0303), so indeed D =\u22c3H\u0303\u22121n (D\u0303). Because compatibility with IPn guarantees that D\u2032\u2014and therefore also D\u0303\u2014is unique, we have shown the first statement to be true.\nFor the second statement, infer that indeed D\u0303 = H\u0303n(D\u2032) =Hn(D) by Eq. (5).\nFor the third statement, compatibility with IPn guarantees that D is coherent if and only if D \u2032 is coherent. But since D\u0303 is defined from D\u2032 using the linear order isomorphism Hn , we have immediately that D\u0303 is coherent if and only if D\u2032 is coherent. Therefore indeed D is coherent if and only if D\u0303 is coherent.\nProof [Proof of Theorem 11] Let C\u2032\u2032 on L(N n) and D\u2032\u2032 \u2286 L(N n) be the representing choice function and set of desirable gambles from Theorem 7, and let C\u0303 be defined by\nCoMn( f ) \u2208 C\u0303(CoMn(O))\u21d4 f \u2208C\u2032\u2032(O) for all O in Q(L(N n)), and D\u0303 \u2236= CoMn(D\u2032\u2032). Since CoMn is a linear order isomorphism, then Mn( f ) \u2208 C\u0303(Mn(O)) \u21d4 Hn( f ) \u2208C\u2032\u2032(Hn(O)) for all O in Q(L(X n)), and D\u0303 = CoMn(Hn(D)) = Mn(D), and all the coherence properties are preserved, from which the statements follow. Proof [Proof of Prop. 15] For Axiom I1, since, by Prop. 3, 0 \u2208 IPn for every n in N, also 0 \u2208 IP . For Axiom I2, consider any f in IP , then there is some n in N for which f \u2208 IPn By Prop. 3, we infer that indeed f /< 0 and f /> 0. For Axioms I3 and I4, consider any f1, f2 and f3 in IP and any \u03bb in R. Then there are ni inN such that fi \u2208 IPni , for every i in {1,2,3}. Let n \u2236=max{n1,n2,n3}. Then f1, f2 and f3 are elements of IPn , so \u03bb f1 \u2208 IPn and f2+ f3 \u2208 IPn by Prop. 3. Then indeed \u03bb f1 \u2208 IP and f2+ f3 \u2208 IP .\nProof [Proof of Prop. 17] The proof for sets of desirable gambles, in a more general context, can be found in (De Bock et al., 2016, Proposition 18).\nWe give the proof for choice functions. For necessity, assume that C is exchangeable, or equivalently, that C is compatible with IP . Use Ref. (Van Camp et al., 2017, Proposition 31) to infer that then, equivalently,\n(\u2200h\u0303 \u2208 IP)(\u2200O\u0303 \u2208 Q(L\u0304(XN)))({0, h\u0303} \u2286 O\u0303\u21d2(0 \u2208C(O\u0303)\u21d4 h\u0303 \u2208C(O\u0303))). (11) Consider any n in N. We need to prove that then Cn is compatible with IPn , or equivalently, that\n(\u2200h \u2208 IPn )(\u2200O \u2208 Q(L(X n)))({0,h} \u2286O\u21d2(0 \u2208Cn(O)\u21d4 h \u2208Cn(O))). (12) So consider any O in Q(L(X n)) such that 0 \u2208 O, and any h in O. Then O is an element of Q(L\u0304(XN)) and h an element of L\u0304(XN), so 0 \u2208C(O)\u21d4 h \u2208C(O). Therefore, by marginalisation, 0 \u2208Cn(O)\u21d4 h \u2208Cn(O), whence Cn is compatible with IPn , and therefore indeed exchangeable.\nFor sufficiency, assume that Cn is exchangeable for every n in N\u2014so it satisfies Eq. (12) for every n in N. We need to prove that then C is exchangeable. Using Eq. (11), it suffices to consider any O\u0303 in Q(L\u0304(XN)) such that 0 \u2208 O\u0303, and any h\u0303 in O\u0303, and prove that 0 \u2208C(O\u0303)\u21d4 h\u0303 \u2208C(O\u0303). Since O\u0303 \u222a {h\u0303} consist of gambles of finite structure, there is some (sufficiently large) n in N for which O\u0303 \u2208Q(L(X n)) and h\u0303 \u2208L(X n). Then by Eq. (12), 0 \u2208Cn(O\u0303)\u21d4 h\u0303 \u2208Cn(O\u0303), so 0 \u2208C(O\u0303)\u21d4 h\u0303 \u2208C(O\u0303), whence C is compatible with IP , and therefore indeed exchangeable.\nProof [Proof of Prop. 18] We only prove sufficiency, since necessity is trivial. So consider any C\u2032 on V(\u03a3X ) such that for every n in N,C\u2032n is coherent. We prove that then C\u2032 is coherent.\nFor Axiom C1, consider any O in V(\u03a3X ). Then every polynomial in O has a certain degree; let n be the maximum of those degrees. Then O \u2208 Q(Vn(\u03a3X )), whence indeed C\u2032(O) =C\u2032n(O) \u2260 \u2205, since C\u2032n is coherent.\nFor Axiom C2, consider any h1 and h2 in V(\u03a3X ) such that h1 \u2aafB h2. Then h2 \u2212h1 \u2208 posi({Bm \u2236 m \u2208 N n ,n \u2208 N}). Let n1 be the degree of h1 and n2 the degree of h2, and let n \u2236= max{n1,n2}. Then the degree of the polynomial h2 \u2212h1 is not higher than n, so h2 \u2212h1 \u2208 Vn(\u03a3X ) and therefore h2\u2212h1 \u2208 posi({Bm \u2236m \u2208 N n}). That guarantees that h1 \u2aafnB h2, whence indeed {h2} =C\u2032n({h1,h2}) = C\u2032({h1,h2}), since C\u2032n is coherent.\nFor Axiom C3, consider any O, O1 and O2 in Q(V(\u03a3X )), and let n be the highest degree that appears inO\u222aO1\u222aO2. ThenO,O1 andO2 all are elements ofQ(Vn(\u03a3X )). For Axiom C3a, assume thatC\u2032(O2) \u2286O2\u2216O1 and O1 \u2286O2 \u2286O. ThenC\u2032n(O2) \u2286O2\u2216O1 and therefore, since C\u2032n is coherent, indeed C\u2032(O) =C\u2032n(O) \u2286O\u2216O1. For Axiom C3b, assume that C\u2032(O2) \u2286O1 and O \u2286O2\u2216O1. Then C\u2032n(O2) \u2286O2\u2216O1 and therefore, since C\u2032n is coherent, indeed C\u2032(O2\u2216O) =C\u2032n(O2\u2216O) \u2286O1.\nFor Axiom C4, consider any h in V(\u03a3X ), any \u03bb in R>0 and any O1 and O2 in Q(V(\u03a3X )), and let n be the highest degree that appears in {h}\u222aO1\u222aO2. Then h \u2208 Vn(\u03a3X ) and O1 and O2 both are elements of Q(Vn(\u03a3X )). Assume that O1 \u2286C\u2032(O2) =C\u2032n(O2), then, since C\u2032n is coherent, indeed \u03bbO1 \u2286C \u2032 n(\u03bbO2) =C\u2032(\u03bbO2) and O1+{h} \u2286C\u2032n(O2+{h}) =C\u2032(O2+{h}).\nProof [Proof of Theorem 19] We first prove the representation theorem for choice functions. That C is exchangeable is, by Prop. 17, equivalent to, Cn is exchangeable, for every n in N. Therefore, for all n in N, by Theorem 11, that is equivalent to\nCn(O) = { f \u2208O \u2236Mn( f ) \u2208 C\u0303n(Mn(O))} for all O in Q(L(X n)), where C\u0303n is uniquely given by C\u0303n(Mn(O)) =Mn(Cn(O)) for all O in Q(L(X n)). (13) Consider any choice function C\u0303 on Q(V(\u03a3X )) such that C\u0303(Mn(O)) = C\u0303n(Mn(O)). Since Mn is a surjection, we find that then C\u0303(O\u2032) = C\u0303n(O\u2032) for all O\u2032 inQ(Vn(\u03a3X )). But every O\u2032 inQ(Vn(\u03a3X )) can be identified with O\u2229Vn(\u03a3X ) for some O in Q(V(\u03a3X )), so C\u0303(O) = C\u0303n(O\u2229Vn(\u03a3X )) for all O in Q(V(\u03a3X )), where, again, we use the assumption that C\u0303n(\u2205) = \u2205, and thus making C\u0303 unique. Then C\u0303(Mn(O)) =\u22c3n\u2208NC\u0303n(Vn(\u03a3X )\u2229Mn(O)) = C\u0303n(Mn(O)), so indeed Cn(O) = { f \u2208O \u2236Mn( f ) \u2208 C\u0303(Mn(O))} for all O in Q(L(X n)), (14) proving the first and second statement.\nFor the third statement, infer from Prop. 12 and Prop. 14 that C is coherent if and only if Cn is coherent for every n in N. Infer from Theorem 11 that, for every n in N,Cn is coherent if and only if C\u0303n on V n(\u03a3X ) is coherent. Infer that, by construction, C\u0303(O) = C\u0303n(O) for every O in Q(Vn(\u03a3X )), then Prop. 18 tells us that indeed C\u0303n is coherent if and only if C\u0303 on V(\u03a3X ) is coherent. We now turn to the representation theorem for sets of desirable gambles. ThatD is exchangeable is, by Prop. 17, equivalent to, Dn is exchangeable, for every n in N. Therefore, for any n in N, by Theorem 11, that is equivalent to Dn =\u22c3M\u0303\u22121n (D\u0303n) where D\u0303n is uniquely given by D\u0303n =Mn(Dn). Infer that Dn = \u22c3Dn/IPn by the compatibility of Dn with IPn . Using Eq. (5), infer that Dn/IPn = M\u0303\u22121n (Mn(Dn)), whence Dn = \u22c3M\u0303\u22121n (Mn(Dn)), which is equal to M\u0303\u22121n (\u22c3k\u2208NMk(Dk)\u2229Vn(\u03a3X )).\nThis shows that Dn equals M\u0303 \u22121 n (D\u0303 \u2229Vn(\u03a3X )) for some D\u0303, and that D\u0303 is exactly given by D\u0303 = \u22c3n\u2208NMn(Dn)=\u22c3n\u2208N D\u0303n , also proving its uniqueness. This proves the first and the second statement. For the third statement, since D\u0303 =\u22c3n\u2208NMn(Dn), we see that clearly D\u0303 is coherent if and only every Mn(Dn) is coherent, which is, by Theorem 11 equivalent to Dn is coherent for every n in N. Now use Props. 12 and 14 to infer that this is equivalent to D is coherent, proving the third statement."}], "references": [{"title": "Representation theorems for partially exchangeable random variables", "author": ["J.

(2010) generalise the axioms in Rubin (1987) to allow for incomparability.", "startOffset": 66, "endOffset": 1239}, {"referenceID": 2, "context": "(2009)) and exchangeability for sets of desirable gambles (see de Cooman and Quaeghebeur (2012)). Choice functions are related to the fundamental problem in decision theory: how to make a choice from within a set of available options. In their book, von Neumann and Morgenstern (1972) provide an axiomatisation of choice based on pairwise comparison between the options. Later on, Rubin (1987) generalised that idea and proposed a theory of choice functions based on choice between more than two elements. One of the aspects in Rubin (1987)\u2019s theory is that, between any pair of options, the agent either prefers one of them, or he is indifferent between them, so two options can never be incomparable. However, for instance when the information available does not allow for a complete comparison of the options, the agent may be undecided between two options without being indifferent between them; this will for instance typically be the case when there is no relevant information available at all. This is one of the motivations for a theory of imprecise probabilities (see Walley (1991)), where incomparability and indifference are distinguished. Kadane et al. (2004) and Seidenfeld et al. (2010) generalise the axioms in Rubin (1987) to allow for incomparability. Exchangeability is a structural assessment on a sequence of uncertain variables. Loosely speaking, making a judgement of exchangeability means that the order in which the variables are observed is considered irrelevant. This irrelevancy will be modelled through an indifference assessment. The first detailed study of exchangeability was de Finetti (1937).
