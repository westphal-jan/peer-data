While there are strong theoretical guarantees on the performance of Greedy for maximizing submodular functions, there are few guarantees for non-submodular ones. However, Greedy enjoys strong empirical performance for many important non-submodular functions, e.g., the Bayesian A-optimality objective in experimental design. We prove theoretical guarantees supporting the empirical performance. Our guarantees are characterized by the (generalized) submodularity ratio $\\gamma$ and the (generalized) curvature $\\alpha$. In particular, we prove that Greedy enjoys a tight approximation guarantee of $\\frac{1}{\\alpha}(1- e^{-\\gamma\\alpha})$ for cardinality constrained maximization. In addition, we bound the submodularity ratio and curvature for several important real-world objectives, e.g., the Bayesian A-optimality objective, the determinantal function of a square submatrix and certain linear programs with combinatorial constraints. We experimentally validate our theoretical findings for several real-world applications.

Specifically, in experimental design, the goal is to select a set of experiments to perform such that some statistical criterion is optimized. This problem arises naturally in domains where performing experiments is costly. In sparse modeling, the task is to identify sparse representations of signals, enabling interpretability and robustness in high-dimensional statistical problems\u2014properties that are crucial in modern data analysis.\nFrequently, the standard GREEDY algorithm (Alg. 1) is used to (approximately) solve (P).

This constant factor can be improved by refining the characterization of the objective using the curvature (Conforti & Cornue\u0301jols, 1984; Vondra\u0301k, 2010; Iyer et al., 2013), which informally quantifies how close a submodular function is to being modular (i.e., F (S) and \u2212F (S) are submodular).\nHowever, for many applications, including experimental design and sparse Gaussian processes (Lawrence et al., 2003), F (S) is in general not submodular (Krause et al., 2008) and the above guarantee does not hold. In practice, however, the standard GREEDY algorithm often achieves very good performance on these applications, e.g., in subset selection with the R2 (squared multiple correlation) ob-\n1F (\u00b7) is monotone nondecreasing if \u2200A \u2286 V, v \u2208 V , F (A \u222a {v}) \u2265 F (A).

To explain the good empirical performance, Das & Kempe (2011) proposed the submodularity ratio, a quantity characterizing how close a set function is to being submodular.\nAnother important class of non-submodular set functions comes as the auxiliary function when optimizing a continuous function f(x) s.t. combinatorial constraints, i.e., minx\u2208C,supp(x)\u2208I f(x), where supp(x) := {i | xi 6= 0} is the support set of x, C is a convex set, and I is the independent sets of the combinatorial structure. One of the most popular ways to solve this problem is to use the GREEDY algorithm to maximize the auxiliary function F (S) := maxx\u2208C,supp(x)\u2286S \u2212f(x). This setting covers various important applications, to name a few, feature selection (Guyon & Elisseeff, 2003), sparse approximation (Das & Kempe, 2008; Krause & Cevher, 2010), sparse recovery (Candes et al., 2006), sparse M-estimation (Jain et al., 2014), linear programming (LP) with combinatorial constraints, and column subset selection (Altschuler et al., 2016). Recently, Elenberg et al. (2016) proved that if f(x) has L-restricted smoothness and m-restricted strong convexity, then the submodularity ratio of F (S) is lower bounded by m/L. This result significantly enlarges the domain where the GREEDY algorithm can be applied.\nIn this paper, we combine and generalize the ideas of curvature and submodularity ratio to derive improved constant factor approximation guarantees of the GREEDY algorithm. Our guarantees allow us to better characterize the empirical success of applying GREEDY on a significantly larger class of non-submodular functions. Furthermore, we bound these characteristics for important applications, rendering the usage of GREEDY a principled choice rather than a mere heuristic. Our main contributions are:\n- We prove the first tight constant-factor approximation guarantees for GREEDY on maximizing nonsubmodular nondecreasing set functions s.t. a cardinality constraint, characterized by a novel combination of the (generalized) notions of submodularity ratio \u03b3 and curvature \u03b1.\n- By theoretically bounding parameters (\u03b3, \u03b1) for several important objectives, including Bayesian A-optimality in experimental design, the determinantal function of a square submatrix and maximization of LPs with combinatorial constraints, our theory implies the first guarantees for them.\n- Lastly, we experimentally validate our theory on several real-world applications. It is worth noting that for the Bayesian A-optimality objective, GREEDY generates comparable solutions as the classically used semidefinite programming (SDP) based method, but is usually two orders of magnitude faster.\nNotation. We use boldface letters, e.g., x, to represent vectors, and capital boldface letters, e.g., A, to denote matrices. xi is the ith entry of the vector x. We refer to V = {v1, ..., vn} as the ground set. We use f(\u00b7) to denote a continuous function, and F (\u00b7) to represent a set function. supp(x) := {i \u2208 V | xi 6= 0} is the support set of the vector x, and [n] := {1, ..., n} for an integer n \u2265 1. We denote the marginal gain of a set \u2126 \u2286 V in context of a set S \u2286 V as \u03c1\u2126(S) := F (\u2126 \u222a S)\u2212 F (S).

Proof of Theorem 1", "text": "The high-level proof framework is based on Conforti & Cornue\u0301jols (1984) (where they derive the approximation guarantee for maximizing a nondecreasing submodular function with bounded curvature). However, adapting the proof to non-submodular functions requires several changes detailed in Section 6.\nProof overview. Let us denote all problem instances of maximizing a non-negative nondecreasing function F (\u00b7) s.t. K-cardinality constraint (max|S|\u2264K F (S)) to be PK,\u03b1,\u03b3 , where F (\u00b7) is parametrized by submodularity ratio \u03b3 and curvature \u03b1. Let P\u2126\u2217,SK \u2208 PK,\u03b1,\u03b3 denote those problem instances with optimal solution \u2126\u2217 and greedy solution SK . We group all problem instances PK,\u03b1,\u03b3 according to the set \u2126\u2217 \u2229 SK := {l1 = jm1 , l2 = jm2 , . . . , ls = jms}, where jm1 , . . . , jms are consistent with the order of greedy selection. Let us denote the problem instances with \u2126\u2217\u2229SK = {l1, . . . , ls} as the group PK,\u03b1,\u03b3({l1, . . . , ls}).\nThe main idea of the proof is to investigate the worst-case approximation ratio of each group of the problem instances PK,\u03b1,\u03b3({l1, . . . , ls}),\u2200{l1, . . . , ls} \u2286 SK . We do this by constructing LPs based on the properties of the problem instances. By studying the structures of these LPs, we will prove that the worst-case approximation ratio of all problem instances occurs when \u2126\u2217 \u2229SK = \u2205. Thus the desired approximation guarantee corresponds to the worst-case approximation ratio of PK,\u03b1,\u03b3(\u2205).\nThe proof. When \u03b3 = 0 or F (\u2126\u2217) = 0, (1) holds naturally. In the following, let \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1] and F (\u2126\u2217) > 0. First, we present Lemma 1, which will be used to construct the LPs.\nLemma 1. For any \u2126 \u2286 V with |\u2126| = K and any t \u2208 {0, . . . ,K \u2212 1}, let wt := |St \u2229 \u2126|.

Hence, the approximation ratio is F (S K) F (\u2126\u2217) = \u2211 i \u03c1i F (\u2126\u2217) , which we denote\nas R({l1, . . . , ls}) = \u2211 i \u03c1i F (\u2126\u2217) . Define xi := \u03c1i F (\u2126\u2217) , i \u2208 [K]. Since F is nondecreasing, xi \u2265 0. Plugging \u2126 = \u2126\u2217 into Lemma 1, and considering t = 0, . . . ,K \u2212 1, we have in total K constraints over the variables xi, which constitute the constraints of the LP.

Specifically, we define y\u2217 as: for k = 1, . . . , q \u2212 1, y\u2217k := x\u2217k; y\u2217q := x \u2217 q \u2212 ; for k = q + 1, . . . ,K, y\u2217k := x\u2217k + k where\nks are defined recursively as: q+1 = \u03b3K\u2212r , and\nq+1+u = q+u K \u2212 r \u2212 u+ 1\u2212 \u03b3\nK \u2212 r \u2212 u , 1 \u2264 u \u2264 K \u2212 q \u2212 1.\nClaim 1. a) The new solution y\u2217 \u2265 0; b) All of the constraints in (2) are still feasible for y\u2217.\nAfter that the change of the LP objective is,\n\u2206LP = \u2212 + q+1 + q+2 + . . .+ K .\nOne can prove that the LP objective decreases:\nClaim 2.

For all {l1, . . . , ls} \u2286 SK , it holds that\nR({l1, . . . , ls}) \u2265 R(\u2205) = 1\u03b1\n[ 1\u2212 ( K\u2212\u03b1\u03b3 K )K] .\nSo the greedy solution has objective F (SK) \u2265 1 \u03b1 [ 1\u2212 ( K\u2212\u03b1\u03b3 K )K] F (\u2126\u2217) \u2265 1\u03b1 (1 \u2212 e \u2212\u03b1\u03b3)F (\u2126\u2217).\n3.3. Tightness Result\nWe demonstrate that the approximation guarantee in Theorem 1 is tight, i.e., for every submodularity ratio \u03b3 and every curvature \u03b1, there exist set functions that achieve the bound exactly.\nAssume the ground set V contains the elements in S :=\n{j1, . . . , jK} and the elements in \u2126 := {\u03c91, . . . , \u03c9K} (S \u2229 \u2126 = \u2205) and n\u2212 2K dummy elements. The objective function we are going to construct will not depend on these dummy elements, i.e., the objective value of a set does not change if dummy elements are removed from or added to that set. Consequently, the dummy elements will not affect the submodularity ratio and the curvature. For the constants \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1], we define the objective function as,\nF (T ) := f(|\u2126 \u2229 T |)\nK\n( 1\u2212 \u03b1\u03b3 \u2211 i:ji\u2208S\u2229T \u03bei ) + \u2211 i:ji\u2208S\u2229T \u03bei, (3)\nwhere \u03bei := 1K ( K\u2212\u03b3\u03b1 K )i\u22121 , i \u2208 [K]; f(x) = \u03b3 \u22121\u22121 K\u22121 x 2 + K\u2212\u03b3\u22121 K\u22121 x. Note that f(x) is convex nondecreasing over [0,K], and that f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, f(K) = K/\u03b3. It is clear that F (\u2205) = 0 and F (\u00b7) is monotone nondecreasing. The following lemma shows that it is generally nonsubmodular and non-supermodular.\nLemma 4. For the objective in (3): a) When \u03b1 = 0, it is supermodular; b) When \u03b3 = 1, it is submodular; c) F (T ) has submodularity ratio \u03b3 and curvature \u03b1.\nConsidering the problem of max|T |\u2264K F (T ), we claim that the GREEDY algorithm may output S. This can be proved by induction. One can see that \u03c1j1(\u2205) = \u03be1 = \u03c1\u03c91(\u2205), so GREEDY can choose j1 in the first step. Assume in step t \u2212 1 GREEDY has chosen St\u22121 = {j1, . . . , jt\u22121}, one can verify that the marginal gains coincide, i.e., \u03c1jt(S t\u22121) = \u03bet = \u03c1\u03c9t(S t\u22121). However, the optimal solution is actually \u2126 with function value as F (\u2126) = 1\u03b3 . So the\napproximation ratio is F (S)F (\u2126) = 1 \u03b1\n[ 1\u2212 ( K\u2212\u03b1\u03b3 K )K] , which\nmatches our approximation guarantee in Theorem 1."}, {"heading": "4.

In proving Theorem 1 we use the similar proof framework (i.e., utilizing LP formulations to analyze the worst-case approximation ratios of different groups of problem instances) as that in Conforti & Cornue\u0301jols (1984), where they derive guarantees for maximizing submodular functions. However, since we are proving guarantees for non-submodular functions, the specific techniques on how to manipulate these LPs are different. Specifically, 1) The building block to construct LPs (Lemma 1) is different; 2) The technique to prove the structure of the LPs (which corresponds to Lemma 2) is significantly different for a submodular function and a nonsubmodular function, and Lemma 2 is the key to investigate the worst-case approximation ratios of different groups of problem instances. 3) The specific way to prove Lemma 3 is also different since the constraints of the LPs are different for submodular and non-submodular functions.\nSubmodularity ratio and curvature. Curvature is typically defined for submodular functions. Sviridenko et al. (2013) present a notion of curvature for monotone nonsubmodular functions. Appendix C provides details of that notion and relates it to our definition. Yoshida (2016) prove an improved approximation ratio for knapsack-constrained maximization of submodular functions with bounded curvature. Submodularity ratio (Das & Kempe, 2011) is a quantity characterizing how close a function is to being submodular.\nApproximate submodularity. Krause et al. (2008) define approximately submodular functions with parameter \u2265 0 as those functions F that satisfy an approximate diminishing returns property, i.e., \u2200A \u2286 B \u2286 V \\ v it holds that \u03c1v(A) \u2265 \u03c1v(B) \u2212 . GREEDY yields a solution with objective F (SK) \u2265 (1 \u2212 e\u22121)F (\u2126\u2217) \u2212K , for maximizing a monotone F s.t. a K-cardinality constraint. Du et al. (2008) study the greedy maximization of nonsubmodular potential functions with restricted submodularity and shifted submodularity. Restricted submodularity refers to functions which are submodular only over some collection of subsets of V , and shifted submodularity can be viewed as a special case of the approximate diminishing returns as defined above. Recently, Horel & Singer (2016) study -approximately submodular functions, which arised from their research on \u201cnoisy\u201d submodular functions. A function F (\u00b7) is -approximately submodular if there exists a submodular function G s.t. (1 \u2212 )G(S) \u2264 F (S) \u2264 (1 + )G(S), \u2200S \u2286 V .\nWeak submodularity. Borodin et al.

For a function F (\u00b7), we show in Remark 4 that the following two facts do not imply each other: i) F (\u00b7) is weakly submodular; ii) The submodularity ratio of F (\u00b7) is strictly larger than 0, and its curvature is strictly smaller than 1.\nOther notions of non-submodularity. Feige & Izsak (2013) introduce the supermodular degree as a complexity measure for set functions. They show that a greedy algorithm for the welfare maximization problem enjoys an approximation guarantee increasing linearly with the supermodular degree. Zhou & Spanos (2016) use the submodularity index to characterize the performance of the RANDOMGREEDY algorithm (Buchbinder et al., 2014) for maximizing a non-monotone function.\nOptimization of non-submodular functions. The submodular-supermodular procedure has been proposed to minimize the difference of two submodular functions (Narasimhan & Bilmes, 2005; Iyer & Bilmes, 2012).

Proof of Lemma 3", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Proof of Lemma 3.", "text": "For notational simplicity, wlog., assume that ji = i, i \u2208 [K].\na) Firstly let us prove that R({l1, ..., ls}) \u2265 R(\u2205).\nThe high-level idea is to change the structure of the constraint matrix in the LP associated with {l1, ..., ls}, such that in each change, the optimal LP objective value R never increases.\nTo better explain the proof, let us state the setup first of all. Let us call the elements inside the set \u2126\u2217 \u2229 SK = {l1 = jm1 , l2 = jm2 , ..., ls = jms} the \u201cjoint elements\u201d, which means that they are joint elements in \u2126\u2217 and SK . Similarly, the elements outside of \u2126\u2217\u2229SK are called the \u201cdisjoint\u201d elements. For the joint elements, two elements li, lj being \u201cadjacent\u201d means that li + 1 = lj . Mapping to the constraint matrix in (2), it means that the corresponding columns (column (li) and column (lj)) are adjacent with each other. So we also call the corresponding columns in the constraint matrix as \u201cjoint columns\u201d.\nWe prove part a) of Lemma 3 by two steps: In the first step, we try to make all of the joint elements inside {l1, l2, ..., ls} to be adjacent with each other; In the second step, we get rid of the joint columns in the constraint matrix from left to right, one by one. Specifically,\nStep 1. Assume that some elements inside {l1, l2, ..., ls} are not adjacent, like the example in (2), where l2 and l3 are not adjacent. Suppose that lr and lr+1 are not adjacent, which means lr + 1 < lr+1. Denote p = lr for notational simplicity. Let us use A to represent the constraint matrix in the constructed LP associated with {l1, l2, ..., lr\u22121, lr, lr+1, ..., ls}, let A\u2032 represent the constraint matrix associated with {l1, l2, ..., lr\u22121, lr + 1, lr+1, ..., ls}. Notice that lr + 1 is a disjoint element for A, but a joint element for A\u2032. Furthermore A and A\u2032 only differ by columns p and p + 1 = lr + 1. Assume that x\u2217 \u2208 RK+ is the optimal solution of the constructed LP with A as its constraint matrix. From Lemma 2, it must hold that x\u2217p \u2264 x\u2217p+1. Combining with the fact that Ax\u2217 \u2265 1, one can easily verify that A\u2032x\u2217 \u2265 1, which implies that,\nR({l1, l2, ..., lr\u22121, lr, lr+1, ..., ls})\n\u2265 R({l1, l2, ..., lr\u22121, lr + 1, lr+1, ..., ls}). (14)\nThe change from {l1, l2, ..., lr\u22121, lr, lr+1, ..., ls} to {l1, l2, ..., lr\u22121, lr + 1, lr+1, ..., ls} is essentially to swap the roles of one originally disjoint element lr + 1 and the originally joint element lr. Repeatedly applying this operation for all 1 \u2264 r \u2264 s\u2212 1 such that lr + 1 < lr+1, we can get that,\nR({l1, l2, ..., lr\u22121, lr, lr+1, ..., ls}) \u2265 R({ls \u2212 s+ 1, ls \u2212 s+ 2, ..., ls \u2212 1, ls}). (15)\nNow the s joint elements inside {ls \u2212 s+ 1, ls \u2212 s+ 2, ..., ls \u2212 1, ls} are adjacent with each other.\nStep 2.

For the continuous constraints, for instance, each vendor has a specified budget limit for advertising, and the ad space associated with each search keyword can not be too large. These continuous constraints can be formulated as a convex set P . For combinatorial constraints, each vendor needs to obey the Internet regulations of sensitive search keywords in his country, so the search engine company can only choose a subset of \u201clegal\u201d keywords for a specific vendor. The combinatorial constraints can be arranged as a matroidM = (V, I).

While there are strong theoretical guarantees on the performance of GREEDY for maximizing submodular functions, there are few guarantees for non-submodular ones. However, GREEDY enjoys strong empirical performance for many important non-submodular functions, e.g., the Bayesian A-optimality objective in experimental design. We prove theoretical guarantees supporting the empirical performance. Our guarantees are characterized by a combination of the (generalized) curvature \u03b1 and the submodularity ratio \u03b3. In particular, we prove that GREEDY enjoys a tight approximation guarantee of 1 \u03b1 (1\u2212 e \u2212\u03b3\u03b1) for cardinality constrained maximization. In addition, we bound the submodularity ratio and curvature for several important real-world objectives, including the Bayesian Aoptimality objective, the determinantal function of a square submatrix and certain linear programs with combinatorial constraints. We experimentally validate our theoretical findings for both synthetic and real-world applications.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
