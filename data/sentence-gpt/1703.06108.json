INTRODUCTION", "text": "In the past decade, a number of openly available Knowledge Bases (KBs) have emerged. The most popular ones include Freebase, Wikipedia, and Yago, containing around 48M, 25M, and 10M entities respectively. Many of the entities overlap across the KBs. In NLP entity linking 1, the task is to link mentioned entities within text to their identity within the KB. A foundational part of setting up a real-time entity linking system is to choose which entities to consider, as memory constraints prohibit considering the entire knowledge base [1]. Additionally, some entities may not be of relevance. In order to maximize quality of the NLP entity linking system, we need to include as many important entities as possible. In this paper we identify a collection of features to perform scoring and ranking of the entities. We also introduce the ground truth data set that we use to train and apply the ranking function."}, {"heading": "2. RELATED WORK", "text": "A large body of previous work has addressed ranking entities in terms of temporal popularity, as well as in the context 1also known as named entity linking (NEL), named entity disambiguation (NED) or named entity recognition and disambiguation (NERD)\nWWW 2017 Companion, April 3-7, 2017, Perth, Australia.\nof a query; however, little study has been done in terms of building the global rank of entities within a KB. Temporal entity importance on Twitter was studied by Pedro et. al. [4]. In [2], authors propose a hybrid model of entity ranking and selection in the context of displaying the most important entities for a given constraint while eliminating redundant entities. Entity ranking of Wikipedia entities in the context of a query, has been done using link structure and categories [5], as well as graph methods and web search [6]."}, {"heading": "3. OUR APPROACH", "text": "Given KB, we want to build a global long-tailed ranking of entities in order of socially recognizable importance. When building the NLP entity linking system, the N top ranked entities from KB should yield maximum perceived quality by casual observers."}, {"heading": "3.1 Data Set", "text": "We collected a labeled data set by selecting 10, 969 entities. We randomly sampled as well as added some important entities, to balance the skewed ratio that KBs have of important / non-important entries. Each evaluator had to score the entities on scale 1 to 5; 5 being most important. Seven evaluators used the following guidelines regarding importance: Public Persons important if currently major pro athletes,\nserving politicians, etc. If no longer active, important if influential (e.g. Muhammad Ali, Tony Blair). Locations look at population (e.g. Albany, California vs. Toronto, Canada), historical significance (Waterloo). Dates unimportant unless shorthand for a holiday or event (4th of July, 9/11). Newspapers important, especially high-circulation ones (WSJ). Sports Teams important if in pro league. Schools important if recognised globally. Films & Song major franchises and influential classics are\nimportant \u2013 more obscure are often not. Laws important if they enacted social change (Loving v.\nVirginia, Roe v. Wade), unimportant otherwise. Disambiguators entities that disambiguate are important\nbecause we want them in the dictionary (Apple, Inc. and Apple Fruit)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Features and Scoring", "text": "Features were derived from Freebase andWikipedia sources. They capture popularity within Wikipedia links, and how important an entity is within Freebase. Some signals used are page rank, link in/out counts and ratio, number of categories a page belongs to in Wikipedia. We also use the\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n06 10\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.I R\n] 1\n7 M\nar 2\n01 7\nnumber of objects, a given entity is connected to, i.e., object and object type count features, as well as the number of times a given entity was an object with respect to another entity, i.e., subject and subject type count features. We also extract social media identities mentioned in an entity\u2019s KB and use their Klout score [3] as a feature. The full set of features derived as well as their performance is listed in Table 1. We model the evaluator\u2019s score using simple linear regression. The feature vector F(e) for an entity e is represented as: F(e) = [f1(e), f2(e), ..., fm(e)] where fk(e) is the feature value associated with a specific feature fk. Normalized feature values are denoted by f\u0302k(e). Features are normalized as: f\u0302k(e) = log(fk(e))max\nei\u2208KB log(fk(ei))\n. Importance score for an\nentity is denoted by S(e) and is computed as the dot product of a weight vector w and the normalized feature vector: S(e) = w \u00b7 F\u0302(e) (1). Weight vector is computed with supervised learning techniques, using labeled ground truth data (train/test split of 80/20)."}, {"heading": "4. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "Table 1 shows precision, recall, F1 and the population coverage for the full list of features and the final system. The importance score was calculated using Eq.1 where final score was rounded to an integer value so it can be compared against the labels from ground-truth data. We observe that Wikipedia features have the highest precision among all the features. The Freebase features have the highest coverage values. The Klout score feature also has one of the highest individual precision values. While this feature has the lowest coverage, it helps boost the final score and floats up a few relevant entities for final system application in social media platforms. We also look at root mean squared error (RMSE) of the entity scores against assigned labels. The final model shows the lowest RMSE value. We also plot the distribution of entity types in the top 1 million ranked entities and the unranked list for the English language. 11% of entities are of type \u2018person\u2019 in the global\nlist while the top ranked list contains 42% entities of type \u2018person\u2019. The percentage of \u2018MISC\u2019 entity types drop from 72% to 29%. These difference in coverage highlight that entities are ranked relevantly in the corpus. In Table 2, we provide examples of entities with their ranks in a particular language. We see that the entity ranks are regionally sensitive in the context of their language, e. g. \u2018Morocco\u2019 is ranked 2 in the ranking for \u2018Arabic\u2019 language. We also observe the rankings are sensitive with respect to the specificity of the entity, for example \u2018bunk bed\u2019 is ranked magnitudally lower than the more generic entity \u2018bed\u2019."}, {"heading": "5. SUMMARY", "text": "We make the ranked list of top 500, 000 entities available as an open source data set at https://github.com/klout/ opendata. To conclude, in this work, we built a global ranking of entities across multiple languages combining features from multiple knowledge bases. We also found that combination of multiple features yields the best results. Future work in this direction is to include new signals such as Wikipedia page view statistics and edit history."}, {"heading": "6. REFERENCES", "text": "[1] P. Bhargava, N. Spasojevic, and G. Hu.
