For example, in this study, the neural task-task training, for example, was conducted on a 3D model of the brain and performed on a 3D model of the brain. The trained task task was repeated for 30 minutes, and in the training task the training task was repeated 24 minutes for 30 minutes. The trained task was then applied to a new single-subject (2D model of the brain and a 4D model of the brain) and placed on a 4D model of the brain (3D model of the brain).", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Mar 2017 14:20:52 GMT  (135kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08084v1", "Submitted to ICLR Workshop 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to ICLR Workshop 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jean-benoit delbrouck", "stephane dupont"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.08084"}, "pdf": {"name": "1703.08084.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "MULTIMODAL NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION", "authors": ["Jean-Benoit Delbrouck", "Stephane Dupont"], "emails": ["Jean-Benoit.DELBROUCK@umons.ac.be", "Stephane.DUPONT@umons.ac.be"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 INTRODUCTION", "text": "In machine translation, neural networks have attracted a lot of research attention. Recently, the attention-based encoder-decoder framework (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014) has been largely adopted. In this approach, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) map source sequences of words to target sequences. The attention mechanism is learned to focus on different parts of the input sentence while decoding. Attention mechanisms have been shown to work with other modalities too, like images, where their are able to learn to attend to salient parts of an image, for instance when generating text captions (Xu et al., 2015). For such applications, Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown to work best to represent images (He et al., 2016).\nMultimodal models of texts and images enable applications such as visual question answering or multimodal caption translation. Also, the grounding of multiple modalities against each other may enable the model to have a better understanding of each modality individually, such as in natural language understanding applications.\nThe efficient integration of multimodal information still remains a challenging task though. Both Huang et al. (2016) and Caglayan et al. (2016) made a first attempt in multimodal neural machine translation. Recently, Calixto et al.

Visual encoder An image associated to this sentence is fed to a deep residual network, computing convolutional feature maps of dimension 14 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 1024. We obtain a set of visual annotations AV = {hv1, hv2, ..., hv196} where hvi \u2208 R1024.\nDecoder The decoder produces an output sentence Y = (y1, y2, ..., yT \u2032), yi \u2208 RE and is initialized by s0 = tanh(WinithtT + binit) where h t T is the textual encoder\u2019s last state. The next decoder states are obtained as follows:\nst, ot = LSTM(st\u22121,Win[yt\u22121; ct\u22121]), yt\u22121 \u2208 RE (1)\nDuring training, yt\u22121 is the ground truth symbol in the sentence whilst ct\u22121 is the previous attention vector computed by the attention model. The current attention vector ct, concatenated with the LSTM output ot, is used to compute a new vector o\u0303t = Wproj [ot; ct] + bproj . The probability distribution over the target vocabulary is computed by the equation :\np(yt|yt\u22121, st\u22121, ct\u22121, AT , AV ) = softmax(Wouto\u0303t + bout) (2)\nAttention At every time-step, the attention mechanism computes two modality specific context vectors {ctt, cvt } given the current decoder state st and the two annotation sets {AT , AV }. We use the same attention model for both modalities described by Vinyals et al. (2015). We first compute modality specific attention weights \u03b1modt = softmax(v T tanh(W1A mod + W2st + b)). The\ncontext vector is then obtained with the following weighted sum : cmodt = |Amod|\u2211 i=1 \u03b1modti h mod i Both vT and W1 are considered modalities dependent and thus aren\u2019t shared by both modalities. The projection layer W2 is applied to the decoder state st and is thus shared (Caglayan et al., 2016). Vectors {ctt, cvt } are then combined to produce ct with an element-wise (e-w) sum / product or concatenation layer.\nMultimodal Compact Bilinear (MCB) pooling Bilinear models (Tenenbaum & Freeman, 1997) can be applied as vectors combination. We take the outer product of our two context vectors ct and cv \u2208 R2L then learn a linear model W i.e. ct = W [ctt \u2297 ctv], where \u2297 denotes the outer product and [ ] denotes linearizing the matrix in a vector. Bilinear pooling allows all elements of both vectors to interact with each other in a multiplicative way but leads to a high dimensional representation and an infeasible number of parameters to learn in W . For two modality context vectors of size 2L = 1024 and an attention size of d = 512 (ct \u2208 R512), W would have \u2248 537\nmillion parameters. We use the compact method proposed by Gao et al. (2016), based on the tensor sketch algorithm (see Algorithm 1), to make bilinear models feasible. This model, referred as the \u201dMM Attention\u201d in the results section, is illustrated in Figure 1 (top right)\nWe try a second model inspired by the work of (Fukui et al., 2016). For each spatial grid location in the visual representation, we use MCB pooling to merge the slice of the visual feature with the language representation. As shown at the bottom right of Figure 1, after the pooling we use two convolutional layers to predict attention weights for each grid location. We then apply softmax to produce a new normalized soft attention map. This method can be seen as the removal of unnecessary information in the feature maps according to the source sentence. Note that we still use the \u201dMM attention\u201d during decoding. We refer this model as the \u201dMM pre-attention\u201d."}, {"heading": "3 SETTINGS", "text": "We use the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014) with a l.r. of \u03b1 = 0.0007 and L2 regularization of \u03b4 = 10\u22125. Layer size L and word embeddings size E is 512. Embeddings are trained along with the model. We use mini-batch size of 32 and Xavier weight initialization (Glorot & Bengio, 2010). For this experiments, we used the Multi30K dataset (Elliott et al., 2016) which is an extended version of the Flickr30K Entities. For each image, one of the English descriptions was selected and manually translated into German by a professional translator (Task 1). As training and development data, 29,000 and 1,014 triples are used respectively. A test set of size 1000 is used for BLEU and METEOR evaluation. Vocabulary sizes are 11,180 (en) and 19,154 (de). We lowercase and tokenize all the text data with the Moses tokenizer. We extract feature maps from the images with a ResNet-50 at its res4f relu layer. We use early-stopping if no improvement is observed after 10,000 steps."}, {"heading": "4 RESULTS", "text": "To our knowledge, there is currently no multimodal translation architecture that convincingly surpass a monomodal NMT baseline. Our work nevertheless shows a small but encouraging improvement. In the \u201dMM attention\u201d model, where both attention context vectors are merged, we notice no improvement using MCB over an element-wise product. We suppose the reason is that the merged attention vector ct has to be concatenated with the cell output and then gets linearly transformed by the proj layer to a vector of size 512. This heavy dimensionality reduction undergone by the vector may have lead to a consequent loss of information, thus the poor results. This motivated us to implement the second attention mechanism, \u201dMM pre-attention\u201d. Here, the attention model can enjoy the full use of the combined vectors dimension, varying from 1024 to 16000. We show here an improvement of +0.62 BLEU over e-w multiplication and +1.18 BLEU over e-w sum. We believe a step further could be to investigate different experimental settings or layer architectures as we felt MCB could perform much better as seen in similar previous work (Fukui et al., 2016)."}, {"heading": "5 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "This work was partly supported by the Chist-Era project IGLU with contribution from the Belgian Fonds de la Recherche Scientique (FNRS), contract no.
