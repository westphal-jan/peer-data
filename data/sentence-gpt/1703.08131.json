INTRODUCTION\nTHE topic of distributed learning, has grown rapidly overthe last years. This is mainly due to the exponentially increasing volume of data, that leads, in turn, to increased requirements for memory and computational resources. Typ-\nical applications include sensor networks, social networks,\nimaging, databases, medical platforms, e.t.c., [1]. In most of those, the data cannot be processed on a single processing\nunit (due to memory and/or computational power constrains)\nand the respective learning/inference problem has to be split into subproblems. Hence, one has to resort to distributed\nalgorithms, which operate on data that are not available on a single location but are instead spread out over multiple\nlocations, e.g., [2], [3], [4].\nIn this paper, we focus on the topic of distributed online learning and in particular to non linear parameter estimation\nand classification tasks. More specifically, we consider a\ndecentralized network which comprises of nodes, that observe data generated by a non linear model in a sequential fashion.\nEach node communicates its own estimates of the unknown parameters to its neighbors and exploits simultaneously a) the\ninformation that it receives and b) the observed datum, at each\ntime instant, in order to update the associated with it estimates. Furthermore, no assumptions are made regarding the presence\nof a central node, which could perform all the necessary\noperations. Thus, the nodes act as independent learners and\nP. Bouboulis and S.

Chouvardas is with the Mathematical and Algorithmic Sciences Lab France Research Center, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., e-mail: symeon.chouvardas@huawei.com\nperform the computations by themselves. Finally, the task of\ninterest is considered to be common across the nodes and, thus,\ncooperation among each other is meaningful and beneficial, [5], [6].\nThe problem of linear online estimation has been considered in several works. These include diffusion-based algorithms,\ne.g., [7], [8], [9], ADMM-based schemes, e.g., [10], [11],\nas well as consencus-based ones, e.g., [12], [13]. The multitask learning problem, in which there are more than one\nparameter vectors to be estimated, has also been treated, e.g.,\n[14], [15]. The literature on online distributed classification is more limited; in [16], a batch distributed SVM algorithm is\npresented, whereas in [17], a diffusion based scheme suitable for classification is proposed. In the latter, the authors study the\nproblem of distributed online learning focusing on strongly-\nconvex risk functions, such as the logistic regression loss, which is suitable to tackle classification tasks. The nodes of\nthe network cooperate via the diffusion rationale. In contrast\nto the vast majority of works on the topic of distributed online learning, which assume a linear relationship between input and\noutput measurements, in this paper we tackle the more general problem, i.e., the distributed online non\u2013linear learning task.\nTo be more specific, we assume that the data are generated by a model y = f(x), where f is a non-linear function that lies in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). These\nare inner-product function spaces, generated by a specific\nkernel function, that have become popular models for nonlinear tasks, since the introduction of the celebrated Support\nVectors Machines (SVM) [18], [19], [20], [6].\nAlthough there have been methods that attempt to generalize\nlinear online distributed strategies to the non-linear domain\nusing RKHS, mainly in the context of the Kernel LMS e.g., [21], [22], [23], these have major drawbacks. In [21] and [23], the estimation of f , at each node, is given as an increasingly growing sum of kernel functions centered at the observed data. Thus, a) each node has to transmit the entire sum at\neach time instant to its neighbors and b) the node has to fuse together all sums received by its neighbors to compute the new\nestimation. Hence, both the communications load of the entire\nnetwork as well as the computational burden at each node grow linearly with time. Clearly, this is impractical for real\nlife applications. In contrast, the method of [22] assumes that\nthese growing sums are limited by a sparsification strategy; how this can be achieved is left for the future. Moreover, the\naforementioned methods offer no theoretical results regarding the consensus of the network. In this work, we present a\ncomplete protocol for distributed online non-linear learning\nfor both regression and classification tasks, overcoming the\n2 aforementioned problems. Moreover, we present theoretical\nresults regarding network-wise consensus and regret bounds. The proposed framework offers fixed-size communication and\ncomputational load as time evolves. This is achieved through an efficient approximation of the growing sum using the\nrandom Fourier features rationale [24]. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first time that such a method appears in the literature.\nSection II presents a brief background on kernel online\nmethods and summarizes the main tools and notions used\nin this manuscript. The main contributions of the paper are presented in section III. The proposed method, the related\ntheoretical results and extensive experiments can be found there. Section IV presents a special case of the proposed\nframework for the case of a single node. In this case, we\ndemonstrate how the proposed scheme can be seen as a fixedbudget alternative for online kernel based learning (solving the\nproblem of the growing sum). Finally, section V offers some\nconcluding remarks. In the rest of the paper, boldface symbols denote vectors, while capital letters are reserved for matrices. The symbol \u2297 denotes the Kronecker product of matrices and the symbol \u00b7T the transpose of the respective matrix or vector. Finally, the symbol \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016 refers to the respective \u21132 matrix or vector norm."}, {"heading": "II. PRELIMINARIES", "text": ""}, {"heading": "A. RKHS", "text": "Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) are inner product spaces of functions defined on X , whose respective point evaluation functional, i.e., Tx : H \u2192 X : Tx(f) = f(x), is linear and continuous for every x \u2208 X . This is usually portrayed by the reproducing property [18], [6], [25], which links inner products in H with a specific (semi-)positive definite kernel function \u03ba defined on X \u00d7X (associated with the space H). As \u03ba(\u00b7, x) lies in H for all x \u2208 X , the reproducing property declares that \u3008\u03ba(\u00b7, y), \u03ba(\u00b7, x)\u3009H = \u03ba(x, y), for all x, y \u2208 X . Hence, linear tasks, defined on the high dimensional space, H, (whose dimensionality can also be infinite) can be equivalently viewed as non-linear ones on the, usually, much lower dimensional space, X , and vice versa. This is the essence of the so called kernel trick: Any kernel-based learning method can be seen as a two step procedure, where firstly the original data are transformed from X to H, via an implicit map, \u03a6(x) = \u03ba(\u00b7, x), and then linear algorithms are applied to the transformed data. There exist a plethora of different\nkernels to choose from in the respective literature. In this\npaper, we mostly focus on the popular Gaussian kernel, i.e., \u03ba(x,y) = e\u2016x\u2212y\u2016 2/(2\u03c32), although any other shift invariant\nkernel can be adopted too.\nAnother important feature of RKHS is that any regularized ridge regression task, defined on H, has a unique solution, which can written in terms of a finite expansion of kernel\nfunctions centered at the training points. Specifically, given the set of training points {(xn, yn), n = 1, . . . , N, xn \u2208 X, yn \u2208 R}, the representer theorem [26], [18], states that the unique minimizer, f\u2217 \u2208 H, of \u2211N n=1 l(f(xn), yn)+\u03bb\u2016f\u20162H, admits a representation of the form f\u2217 = \u2211N n=1 an\u03ba(\u00b7, xn), where l is\nany convex loss function that measures the error between the actual system\u2019s outputs, yn, and the estimated ones, f(xn), and \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016H is the norm induced by the inner product."}, {"heading": "B. Kernel Online Learning", "text": "The aforementioned properties have rendered RKHS a popular tool for addressing non linear tasks both in batch and\nonline settings. Besides the widely adopted application on\nSVMs, in recent years there has been an increased interest on non linear online tasks around the squared error loss function.\nHence, there have been kernel-based implementations of LMS\n[27], [28], RLS [29], [30], APSM [31], [32] and other related methods [33], as well as online implementations of SVMs\n[34], focusing on the primal formulation of the task. Henceforth, we will consider online learning tasks based on the training sequences of the form D = {(xn, yn), n = 1, 2, . . . }, where xn \u2208 Rd and yn \u2208 R. The goal of the assumed learning tasks is to learn a non-linear input-output dependence, y = f(x), f \u2208 H, so that to minimize a preselected cost. Note that these types of tasks include both classification (where yn = \u00b11) and regression problems (where yn \u2208 R). Moreover, in the online setting, the data are assumed to arrive sequentially.\nAs a typical example of these tasks, we consider the KLMS,\nwhich is one of the simplest and most representative methods of this kind. Its goal is to learn f , so that to minimize the MSE, i.e., L(f) = E[(y\u2212f(x))2]. Computing the gradient of L and estimating it via the current set of observations (in line with the stochastic approximation rationale, e.g., [6]), the estimate\nat the next iteration, employing the gradient descent method, becomes fn = fn\u22121+\u00b5\u01ebn\u03ba(xn, \u00b7), where \u01ebn = yn\u2212fn\u22121(xn) and \u00b5 is the step-size (see, e.g., [6], [35], [36] for more). Assuming that the initial estimate is zero, the solution after n\u2212 1 steps turns out to be\nfn\u22121 = n\u22121 \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1i\u03ba(\u00b7,xi), (1)\nwhere \u03b1i = \u00b5\u01ebi. Observe that this is in line with the representer theorem. Similarly, the system\u2019s output can be estimated as fn\u22121(xn) = \u2211n\u22121\ni=1 \u03b1i\u03ba(xn,xi). Clearly, this linear expansion grows indefinitely as n increases; hence the original form of KLMS is impractical. Typically, a sparsification strategy\nis adopted to bound the size of the expansion [37], [38], [39]. In these methods, a specific criterion is employed to decide whether a particular point, xn, is to be included to the expansion, or (if that point is discarded) how its respective output yn can be exploited to update the remaining weights of the expansion. There are also methods that can remove specific\npoints from the expansion, if their information becomes obsolete, in order to increase the tracking ability of the algorithm\n[40]."}, {"heading": "C. Approximating the Kernel with random Fourier Features", "text": "Usually, kernel-based learning methods involve a large\nnumber of kernel evaluations between training samples. In\nthe batch mode of operation, for example, this means that\n3 a large kernel matrix has to be computed, increasing the\ncomputational cost of the method significantly. Hence, to alleviate the computational burden, one common approach is\nto use some sort of approximation of the kernel evaluation. The most popular techniques of this category are the Nystro\u0308m\nmethod [41], [42] and the random Fourier features approach\n[24], [43]; the latter fits naturally to the online setting. Instead of relying on the implicit lifting, \u03a6, provided by the kernel trick, Rahimi and Recht in [24] proposed to map the input data\nto a finite-dimensional Euclidean space (with dimension lower than H but larger than the input space) using a randomized feature map z\u2126 : R\nd \u2192 RD, so that the kernel evaluations can be approximated as \u03ba(xn,xm) \u2248 z\u2126(xn)T z\u2126(xm). The following theorem plays a key role in this procedure.\nTheorem 1. Consider a shift-invariant positive definite kernel \u03ba(x \u2212 y) defined on Rd and its Fourier transform p(\u03c9) = 1 (2\u03c0)d \u222b Rd \u03ba(\u03b4)e\u2212i\u03c9\nT \u03b4d\u03b4, which (according to Bochner\u2019s theorem) it can be regarded as a probability density function.\nThen, defining z\u03c9,b(x) = \u221a 2 cos(\u03c9Tx+ b), it turns out that\n\u03ba(x\u2212 y) = E\u03c9,b[z\u03c9,b(x)z\u03c9,b(y)], (2)\nwhere \u03c9 is drawn from p and b from the uniform distribution on [0, 2\u03c0].\nFollowing Theorem 1, we choose to approximate \u03ba(xn \u2212 xm) using D random Fourier features, \u03c91,\u03c92, . . . ,\u03c9D, (drawn from p) and D random numbers, b1, b2, . . . , bD (drawn uniformly from [0, 2\u03c0]) that define a sample average:\n\u03ba(xn \u2212 xm) \u2248 1\nD\nD \u2211\ni=1\nz\u03c9i,bi(xm)z\u03c9i,bi(xn). (3)\nEvidently, the larger D is, the better this approximation becomes (up to a certain point). Details on the quality of this\napproximation can be found in [24], [43], [44], [45]. We note\nthat for the Gaussian kernel, which is employed throughout the paper, the respective Fourier transform is\np(\u03c9) = ( \u03c3/ \u221a 2\u03c0 )D e\u2212 \u03c32\u2016\u03c9\u20162 2 , (4)\nwhich is actually the multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean 0D and covariance matrix 1 \u03c32 ID .\nWe will demonstrate how this method can be applied using the KLMS paradigm. To this end, we define the map z\u2126 : R d \u2192 RD as follows:\nz\u2126(u) =\n\u221a\n2\nD\n\n  cos(\u03c9T1 u+ b1) ...\ncos(\u03c9TDu+ bD)\n\n  , (5)\nwhere \u2126 is the (d+1)\u00d7D matrix defining the random Fourier features of the respective kernel, i.e.,\n\u2126 =\n(\n\u03c91 \u03c92 ... \u03c9D b1 b2 ... bD\n)\n, (6)\nprovided that \u03c9\u2019s and b\u2019s are drawn as described in theorem 1. Employing this notation, it is straightforward to see that (3)\ncan be recast as \u03ba(xn\u2212xm) \u2248 z\u2126(xm)T z\u2126(xn). Hence, the output associated with observation xn can be approximated as\nfn\u22121(xn) \u2248 ( n\u22121 \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1iz\u2126(xi)\n)T\nz\u2126(xn). (7)\nIt is a matter of elementary algebra to see that (7) can be equivalently derived by approximating the system\u2019s output as f(x) \u2248 \u03b8Tz\u2126(x), initializing \u03b80 to 0D and iteratively applying the following gradient descent type update: \u03b8n = \u03b8n\u22121 + \u00b5enz\u2126(xn). Clearly, the procedure described here, for the case of the KLMS, can be applied to any other gradient-type kernel based\nmethod. It has the advantage of modeling the solution as a fixed size vector, instead of a growing sum, a property\nthat is quite helpful in distributed environments, as it will be\ndiscussed in section III."}, {"heading": "III. DISTRIBUTED KERNEL-BASED LEARNING", "text": "In this section, we discuss the problem of online learning in RKHS over distributed networks. Specifically, we consider K connected nodes, labeled k \u2208 N = {1, 2, . . .K}, which operate in cooperation with their neighbors to solve a specific task. Let Nk \u2286 N denote the neighbors of node k. The network topology is represented as an undirected connected graph, consisting of K vertices (representing the nodes) and a set of edges connecting the nodes to each other (i.e., each node\nis connected to its neighbors). We assign a nonnegative weight ak,l to the edge connecting node k to l. This weight is used by k to scale the data transmitted from l and vice versa. This can be interpreted as a measure of the confidence level that node k assigns to its interaction with node l. We collect all coefficients into a K \u00d7 K symmetric matrix A = (ak,l), such that the entries of the k-th row of A contain the coefficients used by node k to scale the data arriving from its neighbors. We make the additional assumption that A is doubly stochastic, so that the weights of all incoming and outgoing \u201ctransmissions\u201d sum\nto 1. A common choice, among others, for choosing these\ncoefficients, is the Metropolis rule, in which the weights equal to:\nak,l =\n\n \n  1 max{|Nk|,|Nl|} , if l \u2208 Nk, and l 6= k 1\u2212\u2211i\u2208Nk\\k ak,i, if l = k 0, otherwise.\nFinally, we assume that each node, k, receives streaming data {(xk,n, yk,n), n = 1, 2, . . . }, that are generated from an input-output relationship of the form yk,n = f(xk,n) + \u03b7k,n, where xk,n \u2208 Rd, yk,n belongs to R and \u03b7k,n represents the respective noise, for the regression task. The goal is to obtain an estimate of f . For classification, yn,k = \u03c6(f(xk,n)), where, \u03c6 is a thresholding function; here we assume that yn,k \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. Once more, the goal is to optimally estimate the classifier function f . Each one of the nodes aims to estimate f \u2208 H by minimizing a specific convex cost function, L(x, y, f), using a (sub)gradient descent approach. We employ a simple\nCombine-Then-Adapt (CTA) rationale, where at each time instant, n, each node, k, a) receives the current estimates, fl,n\u22121,\n4 from all neighbors (i.e., from all nodes l \u2208 Nk), b) combines them to a single solution, \u03c8k,n\u22121 = \u2211\nl\u2208Nk ak,lfl,n\u22121 and c) apply a step update procedure:\nfn = \u03c8k,n\u22121 \u2212 \u00b5n\u2207fL(xn, yn, \u03c8k,n\u22121).\nThe implementation of such an approach in the context of RKHS presents significant challenges. Keep in mind that, the\nestimation of the solution at each node is not a simple vector,\nbut instead it is a function, which is expressed as a growing sum of kernel evaluations centered at the points observed by\nthe specific node, as in (1). Hence, the implementation of a straightforward CTA strategy would require from each node to transmit its entire growing sum (i.e., the coefficients ai as well as the respective centers xi) to all neighbors. This would significantly increase both the communication load among the\nnodes, as well as the computational cost at each node, since the\nsize of each one of the expansions would become increasingly larger as time evolves (as for every time instant, they gather\nthe centers transmitted by all neighbors). This is the rationale adopted in [21], [22], [23] for the case of KLMS. Clearly,\nthis is far from a practical approach. Alternatively, one could\ndevise an efficient method to sparsify the solution at each node and then merge the sums transmitted by its neighbors.\nThis would require (for example) to search all the dictionaries,\ntransmitted by the neighboring nodes, for similar centers and treat them as a single one, or adopting a single pre-arranged\ndictionary (i.e., a specific set of centers) for all nodes and then fuse each observed point with the best-suited center.\nHowever, no such strategy has appeared in the respective\nliterature, perhaps due to its increased complexity and lack of a theoretical elegance.\nIn this paper, inspired by the random Fourier features\napproximation technique, we approximate the desired inputoutput relationship as y = \u03b8Tz\u2126(x) and propose a two step procedure: a) we map each observed point (xk,n, yk,n) to (z\u2126(xk,n), yk,n) and then b) we adopt a simple linear CTA diffusion strategy on the transformed points. Note that in\nthe proposed scheme, each node aims to estimate a vector \u03b8 \u2208 RD by minimizing a specific (convex) cost function, L(x, y, \u03b8). Here, we imply that the model can be closely approximated by yk,n \u2248 \u03b8Tz\u2126(xk,n) + \u03b7k,n, for regression, and yk,n \u223c \u03c6(\u03b8T z\u2126(xk,n)) for classification, for all k, n, for some \u03b8. We emphasize that L need not be differentiable. Hence, a large family of loss functions can be adopted. For example:\n\u2022 Squared error loss: L(x, y, \u03b8) = (y \u2212 \u03b8Tx)2. \u2022 Hinge loss: L(x, y, \u03b8) = max(0, 1\u2212 y\u03b8Tx).\nWe end up with the following generic update rule:\n\u03c8k,n = \u2211\nl\u2208Nk ak,l\u03b8l,n\u22121, (8)\n\u03b8k,n = \u03c8k,n \u2212 \u00b5k,n\u2207\u03b8L(z\u2126(xk,n), yk,n,\u03c8k,n), (9) where \u2207\u03b8L(z\u2126(xk,n), yk,n,\u03c8k,n) is the gradient, or any subgradient of L(x, y, \u03b8) (with respect to \u03b8), if the loss function is not differentiable. Algorithm 1 summarizes the\naforementioned procedure. The advantage of the proposed\nscheme is that each node transmits a single vector (i.e., its\nAlgorithm 1 Random Fourier Features Distributed Online Kernel-based Learning (RFF-DOKL).\nD = {(xk,n, yk,n), k = 1, 2 . . . ,K, n = 1, 2, . . . } \u22b2 Input Select a specific shift invariant (semi)positive definite kernel, a specific loss function L and a sequence of possible variable learning rates \u00b5n.

As an example, we can study the squared error loss, i.e., L(x, y, \u03b8) = 1/2(y \u2212 \u03b8Tx)2, where: \u2016\u2207L(z\u2126(x), y, \u03b8)\u2016 \u2264 |y|\u2016z\u2126(x)\u2016+ \u2016\u03b8\u2016\u2016z\u2126(x)\u20162 \u2264 V U1 + U21U2. Following similar arguments, we can also prove that many\nother popular cost functions (e.g., the hinge loss, the logistic\nloss, e.t.c.) have bounded gradients too.\nProposition 1 (Asymptotic Consensus). All nodes converge\nto the same solution.\nProof. Consider a KD\u00d7KD consensus matrix A as in (10). As A is doubly stochastic, we have the following [9]:\n5 \u2022 \u2016A\u2016 = 1. \u2022 Any consensus matrix A can be decomposed as\nA = X +BBT , (11)\nwhere B = [b1, . . . , bD] is an KD \u00d7 D matrix, and bk = 1/ \u221a K(1\u2297 ek), where ek, k = 1, . . . , D represent the standard basis of RD and X is a KD\u00d7KD matrix for which it holds that \u2016X\u2016 < 1. \u2022 A\u03b8\u0306 = \u03b8\u0306, for all \u03b8\u0306 \u2208 O := {\u03b8 \u2208 RKD : \u03b8 = [\u03b8T , . . . , \u03b8T ]T , \u03b8 \u2208 RD}. The subspace O is the so called consensus subspace of dimension D, and bk, k = 1, . . . , D, constitute a basis for this space. Hence, the orthogonal projection of a vector, \u03b8, onto this linear\nsubspace is given by PO(\u03b8) := BBT\u03b8, for all \u03b8 \u2208 RKD. In [9], it has been proved that, the algorithmic scheme achieves asymptotic consensus, i.e., \u2016\u03b8k,n \u2212 \u03b8l,n\u2016 \u2192 0, as n \u2192 \u221e, for all k, l \u2208 N , if and only if limn\u2192\u221e \u2016\u03b8n \u2212 PO(\u03b8n)\u2016 = 0. We can easily check that the quantity\nrn := \u03b8n+1 \u2212A\u03b8n = \u2212Mn+1Gn+1. (12) approaches 0, as n \u2192 \u221e, since limn\u2192\u221e Mn = OKD (assumption 1) and the matrix Gn is bounded for all n. Rearranging the terms of (12) and iterating over n, we have:\n\u03b8n+1 = A\u03b8n + rn = AA\u03b8n\u22121 +Arn\u22121 + rn = . . .\n= An+1\u03b80 +\nn \u2211\nj=0\nAn\u2212jrj .\nIf we left-multiply the previous equation by (IKD \u2212 BBT ) and follow similar steps as in [9, Lemma 2], it can be verified that lim n\u2192\u221e \u2016 ( IKm \u2212BBT )\n\u03b8n+1\u2016 = 0, which completes our proof.\nProposition 2. Under assumptions 1-4 (and a cost function\nwith bounded gradients) the networkwise regret is bounded by\nN \u2211\ni=1\n\u2211 k\u2208N (L(xk,i, yk,i,\u03c8k,i)\u2212 L(xk,i, yk,i, g)) \u2264 \u03b3\n\u221a N + \u03b4,\nfor all g \u2208 B[0D,U2], where \u03b3, \u03b4 are positive constants and B[0D,U2] is the closed ball with center 0D and radius U2. Proof. See appendix A.\nRemark 1. It is worth pointing out that the theoretical\nproperties, which were stated before, are complementary. In\nparticular, the consensus property (Proposition 1) indicates\nthat the nodes converge to the same solution and the sub-\nlinearity of the regret implies that on average the algorithm\nperforms as well as the best fixed strategy. In fact, without\nthe regret related proof we cannot characterize the solution in\nwhich the nodes converge."}, {"heading": "B. Diffusion SVM (Pegasos) Algorithm", "text": "The case of the regularized hinge loss function, i.e., L(x, y, \u03b8) = \u03bb2 \u2016\u03b8\u20162 +max{0, 1\u2212 y\u03b8Tz\u2126(x)}, for a specific value of the regularization parameter \u03bb > 0, generates the Distributed Pegasos (see [34]). Note that the Pegasos solves\nthe SVM task in the primal domain. In this case, the gradient\nbecomes \u2207\u03b8L(x, y, \u03b8) = \u03bb\u03b8 \u2212 I+(1 \u2212 y\u03b8Tz\u2126(x))yz\u2126(x), where I+ is the indicator function of (0,+\u221e), which takes a value of 1, if its argument belongs in (0,+\u221e), and zero otherwise. Hence the step-update equation of algorithm 1 becomes:\n\u03b8k,n = (1\u2212 1n )\u03c8k,n\u22121 +I+(1\u2212 yn\u03c8Tk,n\u22121z\u2126(xk,n)) yk,n \u03bbn z\u2126(xk,n), (13)\nwhere, following [34], we have used a decreasing step size, \u00b5n = 1 \u03bbn . This scheme satisfies the required assumptions, hence consensus is guaranteed.\nWe have tested the performance of Distributed-Pegasos versus the non-cooperative Pegasus on four datasets downloaded\nfrom Leon Bottou\u2019s LASVM web page [46]. The chosen\ndatasets are: a) the Adult dataset, b) the Banana dataset (where we have used the first 4000 points as training data and the\nremaining 1300 as testing data), c) the Waveform dataset (where we have used the first 4000 points as training data and\nthe remaining 1000 as testing data) and d) the MNIST dataset\n(for the task of classifying the digit 8 versus the rest). The sizes of the datasets are given in Table I. In all experiments, we\ngenerate random graphs (using MIT\u2019s random graph routine,\nsee [47]) and compare the proposed diffusion method versus a noncooperative strategy (where each node works independent\nof the rest). For each realization of the experiments, a different random connected graph with M = 5 or M = 20 nodes was generated, with probability of attachment per node equal to 0.2 (i.e, there is a 20% probability that a specific node k is connected to any other node l). The adjacency matrix, A, of each graph was generated using the Metropolis rule. For\nthe non-cooperative strategies, we used a graph that connects each node to itself, i.e., A = I5 or A = I20 respectively. The latter, implies that no information is exchanged between the nodes, thus each node is working alone. Moreover, for each\nrealization, the corresponding dataset was randomly split into M subsets of equal size (one for every node). We note that the value of D affects significantly the quality of the approximation via the Fourier features rationale and\nthus it also affects the performance of the experiments. The value of D must be large enough so that the approximation is good, but not too large so that to the communicational\nand computational load become affordable. In practice, we can find a value for D so that any further increase results to almost negligible performance variation (see also section\nIV). All other parameters were optimized (after trials) to give the lowest number of test errors. Their values are reported\non Table IV. The algorithms were implemented in MatLab and the experiments were performed on a i7-3770 machine running at 3.4GHz with 32 Mb of RAM. Tables II and III report the mean test errors obtained by both procedures. For M = 5, the mean algebraic complexity of the generated graphs lies between 0.61 and 0.76 (different for each experiment), while the corresponding mean algebraic degree lies around 1.8. For M = 20, the mean algebraic complexity of the generated graphs lies around 0.70, while the corresponding mean algebraic degree lies around 3.9. The number inside the\nparentheses indicates the times of data reuse (i.e., running the\nalgorithm again over the same data, albeit with a continuously\n6\ndecreasing step-size \u00b5n), which has been suggested that improves the classification accuracy of Pegasos (see [34]). For\nexample, the number 2 indicates that the algorithm runs over a dataset of double size, that contains the same data pairs twice.\nFor the three first datasets (Adult, Banana, Waveform) we have\nrun 100 realizations of the experiment, while for the fourth (MNIST) we have run only 10 (to save time). Besides the\nADULT dataset, all other simulations show that the distributed implementation significantly outperforms the non-cooperative\none. For that particular dataset, we observe that for a single run the non-cooperative strategy behaves better (for M = 20), but as data reuse increases the distributed implementation reaches\nlower error floors."}, {"heading": "C. Diffusion KLMS", "text": "Adopting the squared error in place of L, i.e., L(x, y, \u03b8) = (y \u2212 \u03b8Tz\u2126(x))2, and estimating the gradient by its current measurement, we take the Random Fourier Features Diffusion\nKLMS (RFF-DKLMS) and the step update becomes:\n\u03b8k,n = \u03c8k,n\u22121 + \u00b5\u03b5k,nz\u2126(xk,n), (14)\nwhere \u03b5k,n = yn \u2212 \u03c8Tk,n\u22121z\u2126(xk,n). Although proposition 1 cannot be applied here (as it requires a decreasing step-size),\nwe can derive sufficient conditions for consensus following the results of the standard Diffusion LMS [8]. Henceforth, we\nwill assume that the data pairs are generated by\nyk,n =\nM \u2211\nm=1\nam\u03ba(cm,xk,n) + \u03b7k,n, (15)\nwhere c1, . . . , cM are fixed centers, xk,n are zero-mean i.i.d, samples drawn from the Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix \u03c32xId and \u03b7k,n are i.i.d. noise samples drawn from N (0, \u03c32\u03b7).

For the whole network we have the following\ny n = V Tn \u03b8o + \u01ebn + \u03b7n, (16)\nwhere\n\u2022 y n := (y1,n, y2,n, . . . , yK,n)\nT ,\n\u2022 Vn := diag(z\u2126(x1,n), z\u2126(x2,n), . . . , z\u2126(xK,n)), is a DK \u00d7K matrix, \u2022 \u03b8o = ( \u03b8To , \u03b8 T o , . . . , \u03b8 T o\n)T \u2208 RDK , \u2022 \u01ebn = (\u01eb1,n, \u01eb2,n, . . . , \u01ebK,n)\nT \u2208 RK , \u2022 \u03b7\nn = (\u03b71,n, \u03b72,n, . . . , \u03b7K,n) T \u2208 RK . Let x1, . . . ,xK \u2208 Rd, y \u2208 RK , be the random variables that generate the measurements of the nodes; it is straightforward to prove that the corresponding Wiener solution, i.e., \u03b8\u2217 = argmin\u03b8E[\u2016y \u2212 V T\u03b8\u20162], becomes\n\u03b8\u2217 = E[V V T ]\u22121E[V y], (17)\nprovided that the autocorrelation matrix R = E[V V T ] is invertible, where V = diag(z\u2126(x1), z\u2126(x2), . . . , z\u2126(xK)) is a DK \u00d7 K matrix that collects the transformed random variables for the whole network. Assuming that the inputoutput relationship of the measurements at each node follows\n(16), the cross-correlation vector takes the form\nE[V y] = E[V (V T\u03b8o + \u01eb+ \u03b7)]\n= E[V V T ]\u03b8o + E[V \u01eb],\nwhere for the last relation we have used that \u03b7 is a zero mean vector representing noise and that V and \u03b7 are independent. For large enough D, the approximation error vector \u01eb approaches 0K , hence the optimal solution becomes:\n\u03b8\u2217 = E[V V T ]\u22121 ( E[V V T ]\u03b8o + E[V \u01eb] )\n= \u03b8o + E[V V T ]\u22121E[V \u01eb] \u2248 \u03b8o.\n7 Here we actually imply that (16) can be closely approximated by yn \u2248 Vn\u03b8o + \u03b7n; hence, the RFF-DKLMS is actually the standard diffusion LMS applied on the data pairs {(z\u2126(xk,n), yk,n), k = 1, . . . ,K, n = 1, 2 . . .}. The difference is that the input vectors z\u2126(xk,n) may have non zero mean and do not follow, necessarily, the Gaussian distri-\nbution. Hence, the available results regarding convergence and stability of diffusion LMS (e.g., [48], [49]) cannot be applied\ndirectly (in these works the inputs are assumed to be zero mean\nGaussian to simplify the formulas related to stability). To this end, we will follow a slightly different approach. Regarding\nthe autocorrelation matrix, we have the following result:\nLemma 1. Consider a selection of samples \u03c91,\u03c92, . . . ,\u03c9D, drawn from (4) such that \u03c9i 6= \u03c9j , for any i 6= j. Then, the matrix R = E[V V T ] is strictly positive definite (hence invertible).\nProof. Observe that the DK \u00d7DK autocorrelation matrix is given by R = E[V V T ] = diag(Rzz, Rzz . . . , Rzz), where Rzz = E[z\u2126(xk)z\u2126(xk)\nT ], for all k = 1, 2, . . . ,K . It suffices to prove that the D \u00d7 D matrix Rzz is strictly positive definite. Evidently, cTRzzc = c TE [ z\u2126(xk)z\u2126(xk) T ] c = E [ ( z\u2126(xk) T c )2 ]\n\u2265 0, for all c \u2208 RD. Now, assume that there is a c \u2208 RD such that E [ ( z\u2126(xk) T c )2 ] = 0. Then z\u2126(x) T c = 0 for all x \u2208 RD, or equivalently, \u2211D i=1 ci cos(\u03c9 T i x+bi) = 0, for all x \u2208 RD. Thus, c = 0.\nAs expected, the eigenvalues of Rzz play a pivotal role in the convergence\u2019s study of the algorithm. As Rzz is a strictly positive definite matrix, its eigenvalues satisfy 0 < \u03bb1 \u2264 \u03bb2 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 \u03bbD. Proposition 3. If the the step update \u00b5 satisfies: 0 < \u00b5 < 2\u03bbD , where \u03bbD is the maximum eigenvalue of Rzz , then the RFFDKLMS achieves asymptotic consensus in the mean, i.e.,\nlim n\nE[\u03b8k,n \u2212 \u03b8o] = 0D, for all k = 1, 2, . . . ,K.\nProof. See Appendix B.\nRemark 2. If xk,n \u223c N (0, \u03c3XId), it is possible to evaluate explicitly the entries of Rzz , i.e.,\nri,j = 1\n2 exp (\u2212\u2016\u03c9i \u2212 \u03c9j\u20162\u03c32X 2 ) cos(bi \u2212 bj)\n+ 1\n2 exp (\u2212\u2016\u03c9i + \u03c9j\u20162\u03c32X 2 ) cos(bi + bj).\nProposition 4. For stability in the mean-square sense, we must ensure that both \u00b5 and A satisfy:\n|\u03c1 (ID2K2 \u2212 \u00b5 (R\u22a0 IDK + IDK \u22a0R) (A\u22a0A))| < 1, where \u22a0 denotes the unbalanced block Kronecker product.\nProof. See Appendix C.\nIn the following, we present some experiments to illustrate\nthe performance of the proposed scheme. We demonstrate that the estimation provided by the cooperative strategy is better\nthan having each node working alone (i.e., lower MSE). Sim-\nilar to section III-C, each realization of the experiments uses\na different random connected graph with M = 20 nodes and probability of attachment per node equal to 0.2. The adjacency matrix, A, of each graph was generated using the Metropolis rule (resulting to graphs with mean algebraic connectivity around 0.69), while for the non-cooperative strategies, we used a graph that connects each node to itself, i.e., A = I20. All parameters were optimized (after trials) to give the lowest MSE. The algorithms were implemented in MatLab and the\nexperiments were performed on a i7-3770 machine running at 3.4GHz with 32 Mb of RAM. 1) Example 1. A Linear Expansion in terms of kernels: In this set-up, we generate 5000 data pairs for each node using the following model: yk,n = \u2211M m=1 am\u03ba(cm,xk,n) + \u03b7k,n, where xk,n \u2208 R5 are drawn from N (0, I5) and the noise are i.i.d. Gaussian samples with \u03c3\u03b7 = 0.1. The parameters of the expansion (i.e., a1, . . . , aM ) are drawn from N (0, 25), the kernel parameter \u03c3 is set to 5, the step update to \u00b5 = 1 and the number of random Fourier features to D = 2500. Figure 1(a) shows the evolution of the MSE over all network nodes for 100 realizations of the experiment. We note that the selected\nvalue of step size satisfies the conditions of proposition 3. 2) Example 2: Next, we generate the data pairs for each node using the following simple non-linear model: yk,n = wT0 xk,n +0.1 \u00b7 (wT1 xk,n)2 + \u03b7k,n, where \u03b7k,n represent zeromean i.i.d. Gaussian noise with \u03c3\u03b7 = 0.05 and the coefficients of the vectors w0,w1 \u2208 R5 are i.i.d. samples drawn from N (0, 1). Similarly to Example 1, the kernel parameter \u03c3 is set to 5 and the step update to \u00b5 = 1. The number of random Fourier coefficients for RFFKLMS was set toD = 300. Figure 3(b) shows the evolution of the MSE over all network nodes for 1000 realizations of the experiment over 15000 samples. 3) Example 3: Here we adopt the following chaotic series model [50]: dk,n = dk,n\u22121\n1+d2k,n\u22121 + u3k,n\u22121, yk,n = dk,n + \u03b7k,n,\nwhere \u03b7n is zero-mean i.i.d. Gaussian noise with \u03c3\u03b7 = 0.01 and un is also zero-mean i.i.d. Gaussian with \u03c3u = 0.15. The kernel parameter \u03c3 is set to 0.05, the number of Fourier features to D = 100 and the step update to \u00b5 = 1. We have also initialized d1 to 1. Figure 1(c) shows the evolution of the MSE over all network nodes for 1000 realizations of the\nexperiment over 500 samples. 4) Example 4: For the final example, we use another chaotic series model [50]: dk,n = uk,n+0.5vk,n\u22120.2dk,n\u22121+ 0.35dk,n\u22122, yk,n = \u03c6(dk,n) + \u03b7k,n,\n\u03c6(dk,n) =\n{ dk,n 3(0.1+0.9d2k,n) 1/2 dk,n \u2265 0 \u2212d2k,n(1\u2212exp(0.7dk,n))\n3 dk,n < 0 ,\nwhere \u03b7k,n, vk,n are zero-mean i.i.d. Gaussian noise with \u03c3\u03b7 = 0.001 and \u03c3 2 v = 0.0156 respectively, and uk,n = 0.5vk,n + \u03b7\u0302k,n, where \u03b7\u0302n is also i.i.d. Gaussian with \u03c3 2 = 0.0156. The kernel parameter \u03c3 is set to 0.05 and the step update to \u00b5 = 1. We have also initialized d1, d2 to 1. Figure 3(d) shows the evolution of the MSE over all network nodes for 1000 realizations of the experiment over 1000 samples. The number of random Fourier features was set to D = 200."}, {"heading": "IV.

The framework presented here can be seen as a special\ncase of the general distributed method presented in section\nIII for a network with a single node. Similar to the case of the standard KLMS, the learning algorithms considered\nhere adopt a gradient descent rationale to minimize a specific loss function, L(x, y, f) for f \u2208 H, so that f approximates the relationship between x and y, where H is the RKHS induced by a specific choice of a shift invariant (semi)positive definite kernel, \u03ba. Hence, in general, these algorithms can be summarized by the following step update equation: fn = fn\u22121 + \u00b5n\u2207fL(xn, yn, fn\u22121). Algorithm 2 summarizes the proposed procedure for online kernel-based learning. The\nperformance of the algorithm depends on the quality of the adopted approximation. Hence, a sufficiently large D has to be selected.\nAlthough algorithm 2 is given in a general setting, in the\nfollowing we focus on the fixed-budget KLMS. As it has been discussed in section II, KLMS adopts the MSE cost\nfunction, which in the proposed framework takes the form: L(x, y, \u03b8) = E[(yn \u2212 \u03b8Tz\u2126(xn))2].

Observe that, contrary to the typical implementations of KLMS, where the system\u2019s output\nis a growing expansion of kernel functions and hence special\ncare has to be carried out to prune the so called dictionary,\nthe proposed approach employs a fixed-budget rationale, which\ndoesn\u2019t require any further treatment. We call this scheme the Random Fourier Features KLMS (RFF-KLMS) [51], [52].\nThe study of the convergence properties of RFFKLMS is based on those of the standard LMS. Henceforth, we will\nassume that the data pairs are generated by\nyn = M \u2211\nm=1\nam\u03ba(cm,xn) + \u03b7n, (19)\nwhere c1, . . . , cM are fixed centers, xn are zero-mean i.i.d, samples drawn from the Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix \u03c32xId and \u03b7n are i.i.d. noise samples drawn from N (0, \u03c32\u03b7). Similar to the diffusion case, the eigenvalues of Rzz , i.e., 0 < \u03bb1 \u2264 \u03bb2 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 \u03bbD , play a pivotal role in the convergence\u2019s study of the algorithm. Applying\nsimilar assumptions as in the case of the standard LMS (e.g., independence between xn,xm, for n 6= m and between xn, \u03b7n), we can prove the following results.\nProposition 5. For datasets generated by (19) we have:\n1) If 0 < \u00b5 < 2/\u03bbD, then RFFKLMS converges in the mean, i.e., E[\u03b8n \u2212 \u03b8o] \u2192 0. 2) The optimal MSE is given by\nJoptn = \u03c3 2 \u03b7 + E[\u01ebn]\u2212 E[\u01ebnz\u2126(xn)]R\u22121zz E[\u01ebnz\u2126(xn)T ].\nFor large enough D, we have Joptn \u2248 \u03c32\u03b7 . 3) The excess MSE is given by J exn = Jn \u2212 Joptn =\ntr (RzzAn), where An = E[(\u03b8n \u2212 \u03b8o)(\u03b8n \u2212 \u03b8o)T ]. 4) If 0 < \u00b5 < 1/\u03bbD, then An converges. For large\nenough n and D we can approximate An\u2019s evolution as An+1 \u2248 An \u2212 \u00b5 (RzzAn +AnRzz) + \u00b52\u03c32\u03b7Rzz . Using this model we can approximate the steady-state MSE\n(\u2248 tr (RzzAn) + \u03c32\u03b7). Proof. The proofs use standard arguments as in the case of\nthe standard LMS. Hence we do not provide full details. The\nreader is addressed to any LMS textbook. 1) See Proposition 3. 2) Replacing \u03b8n with \u03b8o in Jn = E[\u03b5 2 n] gives the result. For large enough D, \u01ebn is almost zero, hence we have J opt n \u2248 \u03c32\u03b7 . 3) Here, we use the additional assumptions that vn is independent of xn and that \u01ebn is independent of \u03b7n. The result follows after replacing Jn and J opt n and performing simple algebra calculations. 4) Replacing \u03b8o and dropping out the terms that contain the term \u01ebn, the result is obtained.\nRemark 3. Observe that, while the first two results can\nbe regarded as special cases of the distributed case (see\nproposition 3 and the related discussion in section III), the\ntwo last ones describe more accurately the evolution of the\nsolution in terms of mean square stability, than the one given\nin proposition 4, for the general distributed scheme (where no formula for Bn is given). This becomes possible because the related formulas take a much simpler form, if the graph\nstructure is reduced to a single node.\nIn order to illustrate the performance of the proposed\nalgorithm and compare its behavior to the other variants\n9 of KLMS, we also present some related simulations. We\nchoose the QKLMS [39] as a reference, since this is one of the most effective and fast KLMS pruning methods. In\nall experiments, that are presented in this section (described below), we use the same kernel parameter, i.e., \u03c3, for both RFFKLMS and QKLMS as well as the same step-update parameter \u00b5. The quantization parameter q of the QKLMS controls the size of the dictionary. If this is too large, then\nthe dictionary will be small and the achieved MSE at steady\nstate will be large. Typically, however, there is a value for q for which the best possible MSE (which is very close to the MSE of the unsparsified version) is attained at steady\nstate, while any smaller quantization sizes provide negligible improvements (albeit at significantly increased complexity). In all experimental set-ups, we tuned q (using multiple trials) so that it leads to the best performance. On the other hand, the performance of RFFKLMS depends largely on D, which controls the quality of the kernel approximation. Similar to the case of QKLMS, there is a value for D so that RFFKLMS attains its lowest steady-state MSE, while larger values provide\nnegligible improvements. For our experiments, the chosen values for q and D provide results so that to trace out the results provided by the original (unsparsified) KLMS. Table V gives the mean training times for QKLMS and RFFKLMS\non the same i7-3770 machine using a MatLab implementation\n(both algorithms were optimized for speed). We note that the complexity of the RFFKLMS is O(Dd), while the complexity of QKLMS is O(Md). Our experiments indicate that in order to obtain similar error floors, the required complexity of RFFKLMS is lower than that of QKLMS.\n1) Example 5. A Linear expansion in terms of Kernels:\nSimilar to example 1 in section III-C, we generate 5000 data pairs using (19) and the same parameters (for only one node). Figure 2 shows the evolution of the MSE for 500 realizations of the experiment over different values of D. The algorithm reaches steady-state around n = 3000. The attained MSE is getting closer to the approximation given in proposition 5 (dashed line in the figure) as D increases. Figure 3(a) compares the performances of RFFKLMS and QKLMS for this particular set-up for 500 realizations of the experiment using 8000 data pairs. The quantization size of QKLMS was set to q = 5 and the number of Fourier features for the RFFKLMS was set to D = 2500. 2) Example 6: Next, we use the same non-linear model as in example 2 of section III, i.e., yn = w T 0 xn + 0.1 \u00b7 (wT1 xn) 2 + \u03b7n. The parameters of the model and the RFFKLMS are the same as in example 1. The quantization size of the QKLMS was set to q = 5, leading to an average dictionary size M = 100. Figure 3(b) shows the evolution of the MSE for both QKLMS and RFFKLMS running 1000 realizations of the experiment over 15000 samples. 3) Example 7: Here we adopt the same chaotic series\nmodel as in example 3 of section III-C, with the same parameters. Figure 3(c) shows the evolution of the MSE for both QKLMS and RFFKLMS running 1000 realizations of the experiment over 500 samples. The quantization parameter q for the QKLMS was set to q = 0.01, leading to an average dictionary size M = 7.\n5\nFouKLMS\n5\nFouKLMS\n4) Example 8: For the final example, we use the chaotic\nseries model of example 4 in section III-C with the same parameters. Figure 3(d) shows the evolution of the MSE for both QKLMS and RFFKLMS running 1000 realizations of the experiment over 1000 samples. The parameter q was set to q = 0.01, leading to M = 32."}, {"heading": "V.

So far, a major drawback of any online learning algorithm, operating in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), is the need for updating a growing number of parameters as time iterations evolve. Besides complexity, this leads to an increased need of communication resources, in a distributed setting. In contrast, the proposed method approximates the solution as a fixed-size vector (of larger dimension than the input space) using Random Fourier Features. This paves the way to use standard linear combine-then-adapt techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a complete protocol for distributed online learning in RKHS is presented. Conditions for asymptotic convergence and boundness of the networkwise regret are also provided. The simulated tests illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
