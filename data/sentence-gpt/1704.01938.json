Traditionally, the term similar refers to semantic similarity (e.g. walking should be close to hiking, and happiness to joy), hence the model performance is usually evaluated using semantic similarity datasets. Recently, several works introduced morphology-driven models motivated by the poor performance of traditional models on morphologically complex words. Such words are often rare, and there is not enough evidence to model them correctly. The morphology-driven models allow pooling evidence from different words which have the same base form. These models work by learning per-morpheme representations rather than just per-word ones, and compose the representing vector of each word from those of its morphemes \u2013 as derived from a supervised or unsupervised morphological analysis \u2013 and (optionally) its surface form (e.g. walking = f(vwalk, ving, vwalking)). The works differ in the way they acquire morphological knowledge (from using linguistically\nderived morphological analyzers on one end, to approximating morphology using substrings while relying on the concatenative nature of morphology, on the other) and in the model form (cDSMs (Lazaridou et al., 2013), RNN (Luong et al., 2013), LBL (Botha and Blunsom, 2014), CBOW (Qiu et al., 2014), SkipGram (Soricut and Och, 2015; Bojanowski et al., 2016), GGM (Cotterell et al., 2016)). But essentially, they all show that breaking a word into morphological components (base form, affixes and potentially also the complete surface form), learning a vector for each component, and representing a word as a composition of these vectors improves the models semantic performance, especially on rare words.\nIn this work we argue that these models capture two distinct aspects of word similarity, semantic (e.g. sim(walking, hiking) > sim(walking, eating)) and morphological (e.g. sim(walking, hiking) > sim(walking, hiked)), and that these two aspects are at odds with each other (should sim(walking, hiking) be lower or higher than sim(walking, walked)?). The base form component of the compositional models is mostly responsible for semantic aspects of the similarity, while the affixes are mostly responsible for morphological similarity.\nThis analysis brings about several natural questions: is the combination of semantic and morphological components used in previous work ideal for every purpose? For example, if we exclude the morphological component from the representations, wouldn\u2019t it improve the semantic performance? What is the contribution of using the surface form? And do the models behave differently on common and rare words? We explore these questions in order to help the users of morphology-driven models choose the right configuration for their needs: semantic or morphological performance, on common or rare words.\nWe compare different configurations of morphology-driven models, while controlling for the components composing the representation. We then separately evaluate the semantic and morphological performance of each model, on rare and on common words. We focus on inflectional (rather than derivational) morphology. This is due to the fact that derivations (e.g. affected \u2192 unaffected) often drastically change the meaning of the word, and therefore the benefit of having similar representations for words with the same derivational base is questionable, as discussed by Lazaridou et al (2013) and Luong et al (2013). Inflections (e.g. walked \u2192 walking), in contrast, preserve the word lexical meaning, and only change its grammatical categories values.\nOur experiments are performed on Modern Hebrew, a language with rich inflectional morphological system. We build on a recently introduced evaluation dataset for semantic similarity in Modern Hebrew (Avraham and Goldberg, 2016), which we further extend with a collection of rare words. We also create datasets for morphological similarity, for common and rare words. Hebrew\u2019s morphology is not concatenative, so unlike most previous work we do not break the words into base and affixes, but instead rely on a morphological analyzer and represent words using their lemmas (corresponding to the base form) and their morphological tags (from which the morphological forms are derived, corresponding to affixes). This allow us to have a finer grained control over the composition, separating inflectional from derivational processes. We also compare to a strong character ngram based model, that mixes the different components and does not allow finergrained distinctions.\nWe observe a clear trade-off between the morphological and semantic performance \u2013 models that excel on one metric perform badly on the other. We present the strengths and weaknesses of the different configurations, to help the users choose the one that best fits their needs.\nWe believe that this work is the first to make a comprehensive comparison between various configurations of morphology-driven models: among the previous work mentioned above, only few explored configurations other than (base + affixes) or (surface + base + affixes). Lazaridou et al (2013) and Luong et al (2013) trained models which represent a word by its base only, and showed that\nthese models performs worse than the compositional ones (base + affixes). However, the poor results for the base-only models were mainly attributed to undesirable capturing of derivational similarity, e.g. (affected, unaffected). Working with a more linguistically informed morphological analyzer allows us to tease apart inflectional from derivational processes, leading to different results.\nMost of the works on morphology-driven models evaluate the semantic performance of the models, while others perform morphological evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to evaluate both aspects. While our experiments focus on Modern Hebrew due to the availability of a reliable semantic similarity dataset, we believe our conclusions hold more generally."}, {"heading": "2 Models", "text": "Our model form is a generalization of the fastText model (Bojanowski et al., 2016), which in turn extends the skip-gram model of Mikolov et al (2013).

The n-grams are used to approximate the morphemes in the target word.\nWe generalize Bojanowski et al (2016) by replacing the set of ngrams G(w) with a set P(w) of explicit linguistic properties.

Moving from a set of ngrams to a set of explicit linguistic properties, allows finer control of the kinds of information in the word representation. We train models with different subsets of {W,L,M}."}, {"heading": "3 Experiments and Results", "text": "Our implementation is based on the fastText2 library (Bojanowski et al., 2016), which we modify as described above. We train the models on the Hebrew Wikipedia (\u223c4M sentences), using a window size of 2 to each side of the focus word, and dimensionality of 200. We use the morphological disambiguator of Adler (2007) to assign words with their morphological tags, and the inflection dictionary of MILA (Itai and Wintner, 2008) to find their lemmas. For example, for the words lkzqp ([we will] look [at]), dlkzqd ([she] looked [at]) and lkzqd ([he] looked [at]) are assigned the tags VB.MF.P.1.FUTURE, VB.F.S.3.PAST and VB.M.S.3.PAST respectively, and share the lemma lkzqd. We train the models for the subsets {W}, {L}, {W,L}, {W,M} and {W,L,M}, as well as the original fastText (n-grams) model. Finally, we evaluate each model on several datasets, using both semantic and morphological performance measures.3\nSemantic Evaluation Measure The common datasets for semantic similarity4 have some notable shortcomings as noted in (Avraham and Goldberg, 2016; Faruqui et al., 2016; Batchkarov et al., 2016; Linzen, 2016). We use the evaluation method (and corresponding Hebrew similarity dataset) that we have introduced in a previous work (Avraham and Goldberg, 2016) (AG). The AG method defines an annotation task which is more natural for human judges, resulting in datasets with improved annotator-agreement scores. Furthermore, the AG\u2019s evaluation metric takes annotator agreement into account, by putting less weight on similarities that have lower annotator agreement.\n2https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText 3Our code is available on https://github.com/ oavraham1/prop2vec, our datasets on https:// github.com/oavraham1/ag-evaluation\n4E.g., WordSim353 (Finkelstein et al., 2001), RW (Luong et al., 2013) and SimLex999 (Hill et al., 2015)\nAn AG dataset is a collection of target-groups, where each group contains a target word (e.g. singer) and three types of candidate words: positives which are words \u201csimilar\u201d to the target (e.g. musician), distractors which are words \u201crelated but dissimilar\u201d to the target (e.g. microphone), and randoms which are not related to the target at all (e.g laptop). The human annotators are asked to rank the positive words by their similarity to the target word (distractor and random words are not annotated by humans and are automatically ranked below the positive words). This results in a set of triples of a target word w and two candidate words c1, c2, coupled with a value indicating the confidence of ranking sim(w, c1) > sim(w, c2) by the annotators. A model is then scored based on its ability to correctly rank each triple, giving more weight to highly-confident triples. The scores range between 0 (all wrong answers) to 1 (perfect match with human annotators).\nWe use this method on two datasets: the AG dataset from (Avraham and Goldberg, 2016) (SemanticSim, containing 1819 triples), and a new dataset we created in order to evaluate the models on rare words (similar to RW (Luong et al., 2013)). The rare-words dataset (SemanticSimRare) follows the structure of SemanticSim, but includes only target words that occur less than 100 times in the corpus. It contains a total of 163 triples, all of the type positive vs. random (we find that for rare words, distinguishing similar words from random ones is a hard enough task for the models).\nMorphological Evaluation Measure Cotterrel and Schu\u0308tze (2015) introduced the MorphoDistk measure, which quantifies the amount of morphological difference between a target word and a list of its k most similar words. We modify MorphoDistk measure to derive MorphoSimk , a measure that ranges between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates total morphological compatibility. The MorphoDist measure is defined as: MorphoDistk(w) = \u2211\nw\u2032\u2208Kw minmw,mw\u2032 dh(mw,mw\u2032) where Kw is the set of top-k similarities of w, mw and mw\u2032 are possible morphological tags of w and w\u2032 respectively (there may be more than one possible morphological interpretation per word), and dh is the Hamming distance between the morphological tags. MorphoDist counts the total number of incompatible morphological components.\nEach entry is of the form [word:lexical meaning:morphological tag]. Green-colored items share the semantic/inflection of the target word, while red-colored indicate a divergence. In the morphological tags: M/F/MF indicate masculine/feminine/both,\nP/S indicate plural/singular, 1/2/3 indicate 1st/2nd/3rd person.\nMorphoSim calculates the average rate of compatible morphological values. More formally, MorphoSimk(w) = 1 \u2212 MorphoDistk(w)\nk\u00b7|mw| , where\n|mw| is the number of grammatical components specified in w\u2019s morphological tag.\nWe use k=10 and calculate the average MorphoSim score over 100 randomly chosen words. To evaluate the morphological performance on rare words, we run another benchmark (MorphoSimRare) in which we calculate the average MorphoSim score over the 35 target words of the SemanticSimRare dataset.\nQualitative Results To get an impression of the differences in behavior between the models, we queried each model for the top similarities of several words (calculated by cosine similarity between words vectors), focusing on rare words. Table 1 presents the top-3 similarities for the word dlkzqd ([she] looked [at]), which occurs 17 times in the corpus, under the different models. Unsurprisingly, the lemma component has a positive effect on semantics, while the tag component improves the morphological performance. It also shows a clear trade-off between the two aspects \u2013 as models which perform the best on semantics are the worst on morphology. This behavior is representative of the dozens of words we examined.\nQuantitative Results We compare the different models on the different measures, and also compare to the state-of-the-art n-gram based fastText model of Bojanowski et al (2016) that does not require morphological analysis. The results (Table 2) highlight the following:\n1. There is a trade-off between semantic and morphological performance \u2013 improving one aspect comes at the expense of the other: the lemma component improves semantics but hurts morphology,\nwhile the opposite is true for the tag component. The common practice of using both components together is a kind of compromise: the LM, WLM and n-grams models are not the best nor the worst on any measure.\n2. The impacts of the lemma and the tag components are much larger when dealing with rare words: comparing toW,WL is only 1.7% better on SS and 3.8% worse onMS, while it\u2019s 16.3% better and 11.9% worse on SSR and MSR (respectively). Similarly, WM is only 2.8% worse than W on SS and 44.9% better on MS, while it\u2019s 21.8% worse and 75.7% better on SSR andMSR (respectively).\n3. Simply lemmatizing the words is very effective for capturing semantic similarity. This is especially true for the rare words, in which the L model clearly outperform all others. For the common words, we see a small drop compared to including the surface form as well (WL,WLM). This is attributed to cases in which some of the semantics lies within the word\u2019s morphological template, for example: in W model, most similar words for the masculine verb ltp (fell) are associated with a soldier (which is a masculine noun): bxdp (was killed), rbtp (was injured), while the similarities of the feminine form dltp are associated with a land or a state (both are feminine nouns): dgteq (was annexed), dyakp (was occupied). In Lmodel \u2013 dltp and ltp share a single, less accurate representation (somewhat similarly to representations of ambiguous words). This suggests using different compositions for common and rare words."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusions", "text": "Our key message is that users of morphologydriven models should consider the trade-off between the different components of their representations. Since the goal of most works on"}, {"heading": "WM 0.687 0.528 0.907 1", "text": "morphology-driven models was to improve semantic similarity, the configurations they used (which combine both semantic and morphological components) were probably not the best choices: we show that using the lemma component (either alone or together with the surface form) is better. Indeed, excluding the morphological component will make the morphological similarity drop, but it\u2019s not necessarily a problem for every task. One should include the morphological component in the embeddings only for tasks in which morphological similarity is required and cannot be handled by other means. A future work can be to perform an extrinsic evaluation of the different models in various downstream applications. This may reveal which kinds of tasks benefit from morphological information, and which can be done better by a pure semantic model."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "The work was supported by the Israeli Science Foundation (grant number 1555/15)."}], "references": [{"title": "Hebrew morphological disambiguation: An unsupervised stochastic wordbased approach", "author": ["Menahem Meni Adler."], "venue": "Ph.D. thesis, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.", "citeRegEx": "Adler.,? 2007", "shortCiteRegEx": "Adler.", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Improving reliability of word similarity evaluation by redesigning annotation task and performancemeasure", "author": ["Oded Avraham", "Yoav Goldberg."], "venue": "Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Evaluating Vector-Space Representations for NLP, pages", "citeRegEx": "Avraham and Goldberg.,? 2016", "shortCiteRegEx": "Avraham and Goldberg.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "A critique of word similarity as a method for evaluating distributional semantic models", "author": ["Miroslav Batchkarov", "Thomas Kober", "Jeremy Reffin", "Julie Weeds", "David Weir."], "venue": "Proceedings of the 1st", "citeRegEx": "Batchkarov et al\\.,? 2016", "shortCiteRegEx": "Batchkarov et al\\.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Enriching word vectors with subword information", "author": ["Piotr Bojanowski", "Edouard Grave", "Armand Joulin", "Tomas Mikolov."], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1607.04606.", "citeRegEx": "Bojanowski et al\\.,? 2016", "shortCiteRegEx": "Bojanowski et al\\.", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Compositional morphology for word representations and language modelling", "author": ["Jan A.
