The most standard way to solve this type of problems is to apply Riemannian optimization framework to optimize the SGNS objective over the manifold of required low-rank matrices. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that optimizes SGNS objective using Riemannian optimization and demonstrates its superiority over popular competitors, such as the original method to train SGNS and SVD over SPPMI matrix.\n\n\nThe SGNS objective is a complex task that can be combined with the SVD approach to optimization, particularly for large-scale network architectures, such as deep networks. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the fundamental advantage of SGNS objective to evaluate the effectiveness of SGNS objective. We propose that SGNS objective is a very high performance optimization task that can be combined with the Riemannian optimization framework.

As an example, how to find whether the word \u201ctable\u201d is semantically more similar to the word \u201cstool\u201d than to the word \u201csky\u201d? That is achieved by constructing a low-dimensional vector representation for each word and measuring similarity between the words as the similarity between the corresponding vectors.\nOne of the most popular word embedding models (Mikolov et al., 2013) is a discriminative neural network that optimizes Skip-Gram Negative Sampling (SGNS) objective (see Equation 3). It aims at predicting whether two words can be found close to each other within a text. As shown in Section 2, the process of word embeddings training \u2217The first two authors contributed equally to this work\nusing SGNS can be divided into two general steps with clear objectives:\nStep 1. Search for a low-rank matrix X that provides a good SGNS objective value;\nStep 2. Search for a good low-rank representation X = WC> in terms of linguistic metrics, where W is a matrix of word embeddings and C is a matrix of so-called context embeddings.\nUnfortunately, most previous approaches mixed these two steps into a single one, what entails a not completely correct formulation of the optimization problem. For example, popular approaches to train embeddings (including the original \u201cword2vec\u201d implementation) do not take into account that the objective from Step 1 depends only on the product X = WC>: instead of straightforward computing of the derivative w.r.t. X , these methods are explicitly based on the derivatives w.r.t. W and C, what complicates the optimization procedure. Moreover, such approaches do not take into account that parametrization WC> of matrix X is non-unique and Step 2 is required. Indeed, for any invertible matrix S, we have\nX = W1C > 1 = W1SS \u22121C>1 = W2C > 2 ,\ntherefore, solutionsW1C>1 andW2C > 2 are equally good in terms of the SGNS objective but entail different cosine similarities between embeddings and, as a result, different performance in terms of linguistic metrics (see Section 4.2 for details).\nA successful attempt to follow the above described steps, which outperforms the original SGNS optimization approach in terms of various linguistic tasks, was proposed in (Levy and Goldberg, 2014). In order to obtain a low-rank matrix X on Step 1, the method reduces the dimensionality of Shifted Positive Pointwise Mutual Informa-\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n08 05\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n6 A\npr 2\n01 7\ntion (SPPMI) matrix via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). On Step 2, it computes embeddings W and C via a simple formula that depends on the factors obtained by SVD. However, this method has one important limitation: SVD provides a solution to a surrogate optimization problem, which has no direct relation to the SGNS objective. In fact, SVD minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between X and SPPMI matrix, what does not lead to minimization of SGNS objective in general (see Section 6.1 and Section 4.2 in (Levy and Goldberg, 2014) for details).\nThese issues bring us to the main idea of our paper: while keeping the low-rank matrix search setup on Step 1, optimize the original SGNS objective directly. This leads to an optimization problem over matrix X with the lowrank constraint, which is often (Mishra et al., 2014) solved by applying Riemannian optimization framework (Udriste, 1994). In our paper, we use the projector-splitting algorithm (Lubich and Oseledets, 2014), which is easy to implement and has low computational complexity. Of course, Step 2 may be improved as well, but we regard this as a direction of future work.\nAs a result, our approach achieves the significant improvement in terms of SGNS optimization on Step 1 and, moreover, the improvement on Step 1 entails the improvement on Step 2 in terms of linguistic metrics. That is why, the proposed two-step decomposition of the problem makes sense, what, most importantly, opens the way to applying even more advanced approaches based on it (e.g., more advanced Riemannian optimization techniques for Step 1 or a more sophisticated treatment of Step 2).\nTo summarize, the main contributions of our paper are:\n\u2022 We reformulated the problem of SGNS word embedding learning as a two-step procedure with clear objectives;\n\u2022 For Step 1, we developed an algorithm based on Riemannian optimization framework that optimizes SGNS objective over low-rank matrix X directly;\n\u2022 Our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in terms of SGNS objective and the semantic similarity linguistic metric (Levy and Goldberg, 2014; Mikolov et al., 2013; Schnabel et al., 2015)."}, {"heading": "2 Problem Setting", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Skip-Gram Negative Sampling", "text": "In this paper, we consider the Skip-Gram Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding model (Mikolov et al., 2013), which is a probabilistic discriminative model. Assume we have a text corpus given as a sequence of words w1, . . . , wn, where n may be larger than 1012 and wi \u2208 VW belongs to a vocabulary of words VW . A context c \u2208 VC of the word wi is a word from set {wi\u2212L, ..., wi\u22121, wi+1, ..., wi+L} for some fixed window size L. Let w, c \u2208 Rd be the word embeddings of word w and context c, respectively. Assume they are specified by the following mappings:\nW : VW \u2192 Rd, C : VC \u2192 Rd.\nThe ultimate goal of SGNS word embedding training is to fit good mappingsW and C.\nLet D be a multiset of all word-context pairs observed in the corpus. In the SGNS model, the probability that word-context pair (w, c) is observed in the corpus is modeled as a following dsitribution:\nP (#(w, c) 6= 0|w, c) =\n= \u03c3(\u3008w, c\u3009) = 1 1 + exp(\u2212\u3008w, c\u3009) ,\n(1)\nwhere #(w, c) is the number of times the pair (w, c) appears in D and \u3008x,y\u3009 is the scalar product of vectors x and y. Number d is a hyperparameter that adjusts the flexibility of the model. It usually takes values from tens to hundreds.\nIn order to collect a training set, we take all pairs (w, c) from D as positive examples and k randomly generated pairs (w, c) as negative ones. The number of times the word w and the context c appear in D can be computed as\n#(w) = \u2211 c\u2208Vc #(w, c),\n#(c) = \u2211 w\u2208Vw #(w, c)\naccordingly. Then negative examples are generated from the distribution defined by #(c) counters:\nPD(c) = #(c)\n|D| .\nIn this way, we have a model maximizing the following logarithmic likelihood objective for all word-context pairs (w, c):\nlwc = #(w, c)(log \u03c3(\u3008w, c\u3009)+ +k \u00b7 Ec\u2032\u223cPD log \u03c3(\u2212\u3008w, c \u2032\u3009)).

This entails the optimization in the space with ((n + m \u2212 d) \u00b7 d) degrees of freedom (Mukherjee et al., 2015) instead of ((n+m) \u00b7 d), what simplifies the optimization process (see Section 5 for the experimental results)."}, {"heading": "2.3 Computing Embeddings from a Low-Rank Solution", "text": "Once X is found, we need to recover W and C such that X = WC> (Step 2 in the scheme described in Section 1). This problem does not\nhave a unique solution, since if (W,C) satisfy this equation, then WS\u22121 and CS> satisfy it as well for any non-singular matrix S. Moreover, different solutions may achieve different values of the linguistic metrics (see Section 4.2 for details). While our paper focuses on Step 1, we use, for Step 2, a heuristic approach that was proposed in (Levy et al., 2015) and it shows good results in practice. We compute SVD of X in the form\nX = U\u03a3V >,\nwhere U and V have orthonormal columns, and \u03a3 is the diagonal matrix, and use\nW = U \u221a \u03a3, C = V \u221a \u03a3\nas matrices of embeddings. A simple justification of this solution is the following: we need to map words into vectors in a way that similar words would have similar embeddings in terms of cosine similarities:\ncos(w1,w2) = \u3008w1,w2\u3009 \u2016w1\u2016 \u00b7 \u2016w2\u2016 .\nIt is reasonable to assume that two words are similar, if they share contexts. Therefore, we can estimate the similarity of two words w1, w2 as\ns(w1, w2) = \u2211 c\u2208VC xw1,c \u00b7 xw2,c,\nwhat is the element of the matrix XX> with indices (w1, w2). Note that\nXX> = U\u03a3V >V \u03a3U> = U\u03a32U>.\nIf we choose W = U\u03a3, we exactly obtain \u3008w1,w2\u3009 = s(w1, w2), since WW> = XX> in this case. That is, the cosine similarity of the embeddings w1,w2 coincides with the intuitive similarity s(w1, w2). However, scaling by \u221a\n\u03a3 instead of \u03a3 was shown in (Levy et al., 2015) to be a better solution in experiments."}, {"heading": "3 Proposed Method", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Riemannian Optimization", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1.1 General Scheme", "text": "The main idea of Riemannian optimization (Udriste, 1994) is to consider (6) as a constrained optimization problem.

Note that the gradient \u2207F (Xi) can be naturally considered as a matrix in Rn\u00d7m. Point Xi + \u2207F (Xi) leaves the manifold Md, because its rank is generally greater than d. That is why Riemannian optimization methods map point Xi + \u2207F (Xi) back to manifold Md. The standard Riemannian gradient method first projects the gradient step onto the tangent space at the current point Xi and then retracts it back to the manifold:\nXi+1 = R (PTM (Xi +\u2207F (Xi))),\nwhere R is the retraction operator, and PTM is the projection onto the tangent space.\nAlthough the optimization problem is nonconvex, Riemannian optimization methods show good performance on it.

How can we do it? The most straightforward way to reduce the rank of Xi +\u2207F (Xi) is to perform the SVD, which keeps d largest singular values of it:\n1: Ui+1, Si+1, V >i+1 \u2190 SVD(Xi +\u2207F (Xi)), 2: Xi+1 \u2190 Ui+1Si+1V >i+1.\n(7)\nHowever, it is computationally expensive.

Indeed, the gradient with respect to U (while keeping the orthogonality constraints) can be written (Koch and Lubich, 2007) as:\n\u2202F \u2202U = \u2202F \u2202X V S\u22121,\nwhich means that the gradient will be large if S is close to singular.

We use the following popular datasets for this purpose: \u201cwordsim-353\u201d ((Finkelstein et al., 2001); 3 datasets), \u201csimlex-999\u201d (Hill et al., 2016) and \u201cmen\u201d (Bruni et al., 2014). Original \u201cwordsim-353\u201d dataset is a mixture of the word pairs for both word similarity and word relatedness tasks. This dataset was split (Agirre et al., 2009) into two intersecting parts: \u201cwordsim-sim\u201d (\u201cws-sim\u201d in the tables) and \u201cwordsim-rel\u201d (\u201cwsrel\u201d in the tables) to separate the words from different tasks. In our experiments, we use both of them on a par with the full version of \u201cwordsim353\u201d (\u201cws-full\u201d in the tables). Each dataset contains word pairs together with assessor-assigned similarity scores for each pair. As a quality measure, we use Spearman\u2019s correlation between these human ratings and cosine similarities for each pair. We call this quality metric linguistic in our paper."}, {"heading": "5 Results of Experiments", "text": "First of all, we compare the value of SGNS objective obtained by the methods. The comparison is demonstrated in Table 1.\nWe see that SGD-SGNS and SVD-SPPMI methods provide quite similar results, however, the proposed method obtains significantly better\nSGNS values, what proves the feasibility of using Riemannian optimization framework in SGNS optimization problem. It is interesting to note that SVD-SPPMI method, which does not optimize SGNS objective directly, obtains better results than SGD-SGNS method, which aims at optimizing SGNS. This fact additionally confirms the idea described in Section 2.2.2 that the independent optimization over parameters W and C may decrease the performance.\nHowever, the target performance measure of embedding models is the correlation between semantic similarity and human assessment (Section 4.2). Table 2 presents the comparison of the methods in terms of it. We see that our method outperforms the competitors on all datasets except for \u201cmen\u201d dataset where it obtains slightly worse results. Moreover, it is important that the higher dimension entails higher performance gain of our method in comparison to the competitors.\nTo understand how our model improves or degrades the performance in comparison to the baseline, we found several words, whose neighbors in terms of cosine distance change significantly. Table 3 demonstrates neighbors of the words \u201cfive\u201d, \u201che\u201d and \u201cmain\u201d for both SVD-SPPMI and ROSGNS models. A neighbor is marked bold if we suppose that it has similar semantic meaning to the\nsource word. First of all, we notice that our model produces much better neighbors of the words describing digits or numbers (see word \u201cfive\u201d as an example). Similar situation happens for many other words, e.g. in case of \u201cmain\u201d \u2014 the nearest neighbors contain 4 similar words for our model instead of 2 in case of SVD-SPPMI. The neighbourhood of \u201che\u201d contains less semantically similar words in case of our model. However, it filters out irrelevant words, such as \u201cpromptly\u201d and \u201cdumbledore\u201d.\nTable 4 contains the nearest words to the word \u201cusa\u201d from 11th to 20th. We marked names of USA states bold and did not represent top-10 nearest words as they are exactly names of states for all three models. Some non-bold words are arguably relevant as they present large USA cities\n(\u201cakron\u201d, \u201cburbank\u201d, \u201cmadison\u201d) or geographical regions of several states (\u201cmidwest\u201d, \u201cnortheast\u201d, \u201csouthwest\u201d), but there are also some completely irrelevant words (\u201cuk\u201d, \u201ccities\u201d, \u201cplaces\u201d) presented by first two models.\nOur experiments show that the optimal number of iterations K in the optimization procedure and step size \u03bb depend on the particular value of d. For d = 100, we have K = 7, \u03bb = 5 \u00b7 10\u22125, for d = 200, we have K = 8, \u03bb = 5 \u00b7 10\u22125, and for d = 500, we have K = 2, \u03bb = 10\u22124. Moreover, the best results were obtained when SVD-SPPMI embeddings were used as an initialization of Riemannian optimization process.\nFigure 2 illustrates how the correlation between semantic similarity and human assessment scores changes through iterations of our method. Optimal value of K is the same for both whole testing set and its 10-fold subsets chosen for cross-validation. The idea to stop optimization procedure on some iteration is also discussed in (Lai et al., 2015).\nTraining of the same dimensional models (d = 500) on English Wikipedia corpus using SGD-SGNS, SVD-SPPMI, RO-SGNS took 20 minutes, 10 minutes and 70 minutes respectively. Our method works slower, but not significantly. Moreover, since we were not focused on the code efficiency optimization, this time can be reduced."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": ""}, {"heading": "6.1 Word Embeddings", "text": "Skip-Gram Negative Sampling was introduced in (Mikolov et al., 2013). The \u201cnegative sampling\u201d approach is thoroughly described in (Goldberg and Levy, 2014), and the learning method is explained in (Rong, 2014). There are several open-source implementations of SGNS neural network, which is widely known as \u201cword2vec\u201d. 12\nAs shown in Section 2.2, Skip-Gram Negative Sampling optimization can be reformulated as a problem of searching for a low-rank matrix. In order to be able to use out-of-the-box SVD for this task, the authors of (Levy and Goldberg, 2014) used the surrogate version of SGNS as the objective function. There are two general assumptions made in their algorithm that distinguish it from the SGNS optimization:\n1. SVD optimizes Mean Squared Error (MSE) objective instead of SGNS loss function.\n2. In order to avoid infinite elements in SPMI matrix, it is transformed in ad-hoc manner (SPPMI matrix) before applying SVD.\nThis makes the objective not interpretable in terms of the original task (3). As mentioned in (Levy and Goldberg, 2014), SGNS objective weighs different (w, c) pairs differently, unlike the SVD, which works with the same weight for all pairs and may entail the performance fall.

Sampling (SGNS) word embedding model, well known by its implementation in \u201cword2vec\u201d software, is usually optimized by stochastic gradient descent. However, the optimization of SGNS objective can be viewed as a problem of searching for a good matrix with the low-rank constraint. The most standard way to solve this type of problems is to apply Riemannian optimization framework to optimize the SGNS objective over the manifold of required low-rank matrices. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that optimizes SGNS objective using Riemannian optimization and demonstrates its superiority over popular competitors, such as the original method to train SGNS and SVD over SPPMI matrix.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
