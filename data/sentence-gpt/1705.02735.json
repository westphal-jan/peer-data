Sex trafficking, the dominant form of human trafficking, has seen a significant rise mostly due to the abundance of escort websites, where human traffickers can openly advertise among at-will escort advertisements. In this paper, we take a major step in the automatic detection of advertisements suspected to pertain to human trafficking. We present a novel dataset called Trafficking-10k, with more than 10,000 advertisements annotated for this task. The dataset contains two sources of information per advertisement: text and images. For the accurate detection of trafficking advertisements, we designed and trained a deep multimodal model called the Human Trafficking Deep Network (HTDN). The Deep Network is a network of 10,000 clients dedicated to developing networks for trafficking and trafficking. Our model consists of three distinct groups of clients (two of whom have been identified as \"caught\", \"taken\", \"unidentified\", \"taken\", \"unidentified\") and three groups of clients, each of whom has a personal relationship with the trafficking network (at least five individuals that have ties to the trafficking network). The network is used for identifying trafficking advertisements and for identifying illegal prostitution. Our model also includes other clients involved in trafficking and trafficking, as well as trafficked women and children. We are also able to provide a detailed investigation of trafficking in various countries, including: Albania (an EU member, including Hungary and Slovakia) and Serbia (two countries). We also provide a thorough analysis of trafficking and trafficking in Latin America, and we hope that the results are useful in the field of trafficking detection, in the areas where trafficking is most prevalent, especially among prostitutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 May 2017 03:48:01 GMT  (15878kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02735v1", "ACL 2017 Long Paper"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2017 Long Paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY", "authors": ["edmund tong", "amir zadeh", "cara jones", "louis-philippe morency"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.02735"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.02735.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "Combating Human Trafficking with Deep Multimodal Models", "authors": ["Edmund Tong", "Amir Zadeh", "Cara Jones"], "emails": ["edtong@cmu.edu", "abagherz@cs.cmu.edu", "cara@marinusanalytics.com", "morency@cs.cmu.edu"], "sections": [{"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": "Human trafficking \u201ca crime that shames us all\u201d (UNODC, 2008), has seen a steep rise in the United States since 2012. The number of cases reported rose from 3,279 in 2012 to 7,572 in 2016\u2014more than doubling over the course of five years (Hotline, 2017). Sex trafficking is a form of human trafficking, and is a global epidemic affecting millions of people each year (McCarthy, 2014). Victims of sex trafficking are subjected to coercion, force, and control, and are not able to ask for help. Put plainly, sex trafficking is modern-day slavery and is one of the top priorities of law enforcement agencies at all levels.\nA major advertising ground for human traffickers is the World Wide Web. The Internet has brought\n* Authors contributed equally.\ntraffickers the ability to advertise online and has fostered the growth of numerous adult escort sites. Each day, there are tens of thousands of Internet advertisements posted in the United States and Canada that market commercial sex. Hiding among the noise of at-will adult escort ads are ads posted by sex traffickers. Often long undetected, trafficking rings and escort websites form a profit cycle that fuels the increase of both trafficking rings and escort websites.\nFor law enforcement, this presents a significant challenge: how should we identify advertisements that are associated with sex trafficking? Police have limited human and technical resources, and manually sifting through thousands of ads in the hopes of finding something suspicious is a poor use of those resources, even if they know what they are looking for. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning approaches in Natural Language Processing and computer vision to detect and report advertisements suspected of trafficking is the main focus of our work. In other words, we strive to find the victims and perpetrators of trafficking who hide in plain sight in the massive amounts of data online. By narrowing down the number of advertisements that law enforcement must sift through, we endeavor to provide a real opportunity for law enforcement to intervene in the lives of victims. However, there are non-trivial challenges facing this line of research:\nAdversarial Environment. Human trafficking rings are aware that law enforcement monitors their online activity. Over the years, law enforcement officers have populated lists of keywords that frequently occur in trafficking advertisements. However, these simplistic queries fail when traffickers use complex obfuscation. Traffickers, again aware of this, move to new keywords to blend in with the at-will escort advertisements. This trend creates an adversarial environment for any machine learning\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n02 73\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 8\nM ay\n2 01\n7\nsystem that attempts to find trafficking rings hiding in plain sight.\nDefective Language Compositionality. Online escort advertisements are difficult to analyze, because they lack grammatical structures such as constituency. Therefore, any form of inference must rely more on context than on grammar. This presents a significant challenge to the NLP community. Furthermore, the majority of the ads contain emojis and non-English characters.\nGeneralizable Language Context. Machine learning techniques can easily learn unreliable cues in training sets such as phone numbers, keywords, and other forms of semantically unreliable discriminators to reduce the training loss. Due to limited similarity between the training and test data due to the large number of ads available online, relying on these cues is futile. Learned discriminative features should be generalizable and model semantics of trafficking.\nMultimodal Nature. Escort advertisements are composed of both textual and visual information. Our model should treat these features interdependently. For instance, if the text indicates that the escort is in a hotel room, our model should consider the effect that such knowledge may have on the importance of certain visual features.\nWe believe that studying human trafficking advertisements can be seen as a fundamental challenge to the NLP, computer vision, and machine learning communities dealing with language and vision problems. In this paper, we present the following contributions to this research direction. First, we study the language and vision modalities of the escort advertisements through deep neural modeling. Second, we take a significant step in automatic detection of advertisements suspected of sex trafficking. While previous methods (Dubrawski et al., 2015) have used simplistic classifiers, we build an end-to-end-trained multimodal deep model called the Human Trafficking Deep Network (HTDN). The HTDN uses information from both text and images to extract cues of human trafficking, and shows outstanding performance compared to previously used models. Third, we present the first rigorously annotated dataset for detection of human trafficking, called Trafficking-10k, which includes more than 10,000 trafficking ads labeled with likelihoods of having been posted by traffickers.1\n1Due to the sensitive nature of this dataset, access can only be granted by emailing Cara Jones. Different levels of access"}, {"heading": "2 Related Works", "text": "Automatic detection of human trafficking has been a relatively unexplored area of machine learning research. Very few machine learning approaches have been proposed to detect signs of human trafficking online. Most of these approaches use simplistic methods such as multimedia matching (Zhou et al., 2016), text-based filtering classifiers such as random forests, logistic regression, and SVMs (Dubrawski et al., 2015), and named-entity recognition to isolate the instances of trafficking (Nagpal et al., 2015). Studies have suggested using statistical methods to find keywords and signs of trafficking from data to help law enforcement agencies (Kennedy, 2012) as well as adult content filtering using textual information (Zhou et al., 2016).\nMultimodal approaches have gained popularity over the past few years. These multimodal models have been used for medical purposes, such as detection of suicidal risk, PTSD and depression (Scherer et al., 2016; Venek et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2013; Valstar et al., 2016); sentiment analysis (Zadeh et al., 2016b; Poria et al., 2016; Zadeh et al., 2016a); emotion recognition (Poria et al., 2017); image captioning and media description (You et al., 2016; Donahue et al., 2015); question answering (Antol et al., 2015); and multimodal translation (Specia et al., 2016).\nTo the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first multimodal and deep model for detection of human trafficking."}, {"heading": "3 Trafficking-10k Dataset", "text": "In this section, we present the dataset for our studies. We formalize the problem of recognizing sex trafficking as a machine learning task. The input data is text and images; this is mapped to a measure of how suspicious the advertisement is with regards to human trafficking."}, {"heading": "3.1 Data Acquisition and Preprocessing", "text": "A subset of 10,000 ads were sampled randomly from a large cache of escort ads for annotation in Trafficking-10k dataset. The distribution of advertisements across the United States and Canada is shown in Figure 1, which indicates the diversity of advertisements in Trafficking-10k. This diversity ensures that models trained on Trafficking-10k can be applicable nationwide. The 10,000 collected ads\nare provided only to scientific community.\neach consist of text and zero or more images. The text in the dataset is in plain text format, derived by stripping the HTML tags from the raw source of the ads. The set of characters in each advertisement is encoded as UTF-8, because there is ample usage of smilies and non-English characters. Advertisements are truncated to the first 184 words, as this covers more than 90% of the ads. Images are resized to 224\u00d7 224 pixels with RGB channels."}, {"heading": "3.2 Trafficking Annotation", "text": "Detecting whether or not an advertisement is suspicious requires years of practice and experience in working closely with law enforcement. As a result, annotation is a highly complicated and expensive process, which cannot be scaled using crowdsourcing. In our dataset, annotation is carried out by two expert annotators, each with at least five years of experience, in detection of human trafficking and another annotator with one year of experience. In our dataset, annotations were done by three experts. One expert has over a year of experience, and the other two have over five years of experience in the human trafficking domain. To calculate the interannotator agreement, each annotator is given the same set of 1000 ads to annotate and the nominal agreement is found: there was a 83% pairwise agreement (0.62 Krippendorff\u2019s alpha). Also, to make sure that annotations are generalizable across the annotators and law enforcement officers, two law enforcement officers annotated, respectively, a subset of 500 and 100 of the advertisements. We found a 62% average pairwise agreement (0.42 Krippendorff\u2019s alpha) with our annotators. This gap is reasonable, as law enforcement officers only have experience with local advertisements, while\nTrafficking-10k annotators have experience with cases across the United States.\nAnnotators used an annotation interface specifically designed for the Trafficking-10k dataset. In the annotation interface, each advertisement was displayed on a separate webpage. The order of the advertisements is determined uniformly randomly, and annotators were unable to move to the next advertisement without labeling the current one. For each advertisement, the annotator was presented with the question: \u201cIn your opinion, would you consider this advertisement suspicious of human trafficking?\u201d The annotator is presented with the following options: \u201cCertainly no,\u201d \u201cLikely no,\u201d \u201cWeakly no,\u201d \u201cUnsure,\u201d2 \u201cWeakly yes,\u201d \u201cLikely yes,\u201d and \u201cCertainly yes.\u201d Thus, the degree to which advertisements are suspicious is quantized into seven levels."}, {"heading": "3.3 Analysis of Language", "text": "The language used in these advertisements introduces fundamental challenges to the field of NLP. The nature of the textual content in these advertisements raises the question of how we can make inferences in a linguistic environment with a constantly evolving lexicon. Language used in the Trafficking-10k dataset is highly inconsistent with standard grammar. Often, words are obfuscated by emojis and symbols. The word ordering is inconsistent, and there is rarely any form of constituency. This form of language is completely different from spoken and written English. These attributes make escort advertisements appear somewhat similar to tweets, specifically since these ads are normally short (more than 90% of the ads have at most 184 words). Another point of complexity in these advertisements is the high number of unigrams, due to usage of uncommon words and obfuscation. On top of unigram complexity, advertisers continuously change their writing pattern, making this problem more complex."}, {"heading": "3.4 Dataset Statistics", "text": "There are 106,954 distinct unigrams, 353,324 distinct bigrams, and 565,403 trigrams in the Trafficking-10k dataset.

The length of non-suspected ads is 141; the standard deviation is 85, the minimum is 7, and the maximum is 1810. The total number of suspected ads is 3257; and the total number of non-suspected ads is 6992. Figure 2 shows the histogram of number of ads based on their length. Both the positive and negative distributions are similar. This means that there is no obvious length difference between the two classes. Most of the ads have a length of 80\u2013180 words."}, {"heading": "4 Model", "text": "In this section, we present our deep multimodal network called the Human Trafficking Deep Network (HTDN). The HTDN is a multimodal network with language and vision components. The input to the HTDN is an ad, text and images. The HTDN is shown in Figure 3. In the remainder of this section, we will outline the different parts of the HTDN, and the input features to each component."}, {"heading": "4.1 Trafficking Word Embeddings", "text": "Our approach to deal with the adversarial environment of escort ads is to use word vectors, defining\nwords not based on their constituent characters, but rather based on their context. For instance, consider the two unigrams \u201ccash\u201d and \u201c\u00a9a$h.\u201d While these contain different characters, semantically they are the same, and they occur in the same context. Thus, our expectation is that both the unigrams will be mapped to similar vectors. Word embeddings pretrained on general domains do not cover most of the unigrams in Trafficking-10k. For instance, the GloVe embedding (Pennington et al., 2014) trained on Wikipedia covers only 49.7% of our unigrams. The first step of the HTDN pipeline is to train word vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013) based on the skip-gram model. This is especially suitable for escort ads, because skip-gram models are able to capture context without relying on word order. We train the word embedding using 1,000,000 unlabeled ads from a dataset that does not include the Trafficking-10k data. For each advertisement, the input to the trained embedding is a sequence of words w\u0302 = [w\u03021, . . . , w\u0302t], and the output is a sequence of 100-dimensional word vectors w = [w1, . . . , wt], where t is the size of the advertisement and wi \u2208 R100. Our trained word vectors cover 94.9% of the unigrams in the Trafficking-10k dataset."}, {"heading": "4.2 Language Network", "text": "Our language network is designed to deal with two challenging aspects of escort advertisements: (1) violation of constituency, and (2) presence of irrelevant information not related to trafficking but present in ads. We address both of these issues by learning a time dependent embedding at word level. This allows the model to not rely on constituency and also remember useful information from the past, should the model get overwhelmed by irrelevant information. Our proposed language network, Fl, takes as input a sequence of word vectors w = [w1, . . . , wt], and outputs a neural language representation hl. As a first step, Fl uses the word embeddings as input to a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network and produces a new supervised context-aware word embedding u = [u1, . . . , ut] where ui \u2208 R300 is the output of the LSTM at time i. Then, u is fed into a fully connected layer with dropout p = 0.5 to produce the neural language representation hl \u2208 R300 according to the following formulas with weights Wl for the LSTM and implicit weights in the fully\nconnected layers, which we represent by FC :\nui = LSTM (i, wi;Wl) (1)\nu = [u1, . . . , ut] (2)\nhl = FC (u). (3)\nThe generated hl is then used as part of the HTDN pipeline, and is also trained independently to assess the performance of the language-only model. The language network Fl is the combination of the LSTM and the fully-connected network."}, {"heading": "4.3 Vision Network", "text": "Parallel to the language network, the vision network Fv takes as input advertisement images and extracts visual representations hv. The vision network takes at most five images; the median number of images per advertisement in Trafficking-10k is 5. To learn contextual and abstract information from images, we use a deep convolutional neural network called Trafficking-VGG (T-VGG), a finetuned instance of the well-known VGG network (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014). T-VGG is a deep model with 13 consecutive convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers; it does not include the softmax layer of VGG. The procedure for fine-tuning T-VGG maps each individual image to a label that comes from the advertisement, and then performs end-to-end training. For example, if there are five images in an advertisement with positive\nlabel, all five images are mapped to positive label. After fine-tuning, three fully connected layers of 200 neurons with dropout p = 0.5 are added to the network. The combination of T-VGG and the fully connected layers is the vision network Fl. We consider five images \u0131\u0302 = {\u0131\u03021, . . . , \u0131\u03025} from each input advertisement. If the advertisement has fewer than five images, zero-filled images are added. For each image, the output of Fv is a representation of five images i = {i1, . . . , i5}. The visual representation hv \u2208 R5\u00d7200 is a matrix with a size-200 representation of each of the 5 images:\nhv = Fv (\u0302\u0131;Wv). (4)"}, {"heading": "4.4 Multimodal Fusion", "text": "Escort advertisements have complex dynamics between text and images. Often, neither linguistic nor visual cues alone can suffice to classify whether an ad is suspicious. Interactions between linguistic and visual cues can be non-trivial, so this requires an explicit joint representation for each neuron in the linguistic and visual representations. In our multimodal fusion approach we address this by calculating an outer product between language and visual representations hl and hv to build the full space of possible outcomes:\nhm = hl \u2297 hv, (5) where \u2297 is an outer product of the two representations. This creates a joint multimodal tensor called\nhm for language and visual modalities. In this tensor, every neuron in the language representation is multiplied by every neuron in vision representation, thus creating a new representation containing the information of both of them. Thus, the final fusion tensor hm \u2208 R5\u00d7200\u00d7300 contains information from the joint interaction of the language and visual modalities."}, {"heading": "4.5 Convolutional Decision Network", "text": "The multimodal representation hm is used as the input to the convolutional decision network Fd. Fd has two layers of convolution and max pooling with a dropout rate of p = 0.5, followed by a fully connected layer of 150 neurons with a dropout rate of p = 0.5. Performing convolutions in this space enables the model to attend to small areas of linguistic and visual cues. It can thus find correspondences between specific combinations of the linguistic and visual representations. The final decision is made\nby a single sigmoid neuron."}, {"heading": "5 Experiments", "text": "In our experiments, we compare the HTDN with previously used approaches for detection of trafficking suspicious ads. Furthermore, we compare the HTDN to the performance of its unimodal components.

We presented a novel dataset, Trafficking10k, with more than 10,000 advertisements annotated for this task. The dataset contains two modalities of information per advertisement: text and images. We designed a deep multimodal model called the Human Trafficking Deep Network (HTDN). We compared the performance of the HTDN to various models that use language and vision alone. The HTDN outperformed all of these, indicating that using information from both sources may be more helpful than using just one.\nExploring language through character modeling. In order to eliminate the need for retraining the word vectors as the language of the domain evolves, we plan to use character models to learn a better language model for trafficking. As new obfuscated words are introduced in escort advertisements, our hope is that character models will stay invariant to these obfuscations.\nUnderstanding images. While CNNs have proven to be useful for many different computer vision tasks, we seek to improve the learning capability of the visual network. Future direction involves using graphical modeling to understand interactions in the scene. Another direction involves working to understand text in images, which can provide more information about the subjects of the images.\nGiven that the current state of the art in this area generally does not use deep models, this may be a major opportunity for improvement.

Sex trafficking, the dominant form of human trafficking, has seen a significant rise mostly due to the abundance of escort websites, where human traffickers can openly advertise among at-will escort advertisements. In this paper, we take a major step in the automatic detection of advertisements suspected to pertain to human trafficking. We present a novel dataset called Trafficking-10k, with more than 10,000 advertisements annotated for this task. The dataset contains two sources of information per advertisement: text and images. For the accurate detection of trafficking advertisements, we designed and trained a deep multimodal model called the Human Trafficking Deep Network (HTDN).", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
