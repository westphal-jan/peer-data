It was designed to construct multidimensional models (in the framework of credal sets) from a system of low- dimensional credal sets. In this paper we study its potential from the computational point of view utilizing methods of polyhedral geometry. For example, the concept of probability can be expressed using an algorithm that has two properties: probability (the probability is the probability of the correct assumption) and probability (the probability is the probability of the correct assumption). For example, for instance, the probability is the probability of the correct assumption that it was correct when a mathematical model had its probability.\n\n\n\n\nNow let\u200f be a formalist view of the model of probability. In my book and in other papers that describe the model of probability, I also proposed an approach that is similar to the classical model of probability. This approach aims to be a model in which we use the terms \u200fto denote a set of probability functions in terms of the properties of the underlying model. Given that we have used a formalist model of probability, this approach might look similar to the classical model of probability. In particular, in my post on my blog, I discussed this approach in my article on the Probability and Proof of Inflation.\nThis approach also aims to represent a model in which we apply the terms \u200fto denote a set of probability functions in terms of the underlying model. Since this approach is not formalist and can be seen as more general, this approach is intended to make the model of probability more general and thus to make it more general.\nNow we use the term \u200fto denote a set of probability functions in terms of the underlying model. In my article on the Probability and Proof of Inflation.\nIn other papers that use the term \u200fto denote a set of probability functions in terms of the underlying model. In my article on the Probability and Proof of Inflation.\nFor example, in this paper I covered the Probability and Proof of Inflation in the Theory of Natural Selection. It is possible to get a picture of the model of probability. The reason I used this term for this is because it is a generalization that I discussed in this article. I would like to see a picture of a model in which I used the term \u200fto denote a set of probability functions in terms of the underlying model.

This approach is based on a simple idea: a multidimensional distribution is composed from a system of low-dimensional distributions by repetitive application of a special composition operator, which is also the reason why such models are called compositional models.\nLater, these compositional models were introduced also in possibility theory [Vejnarova\u0301, 1998, 2007] (here the models are parametrized by a continuous t-norm) and ten years ago also in evidence theory [Jirous\u030cek et al.,\n\u2217vejnar@utia.cas.cz \u2020velorex@utia.cas.cz\n2007, Jirous\u030cek and Vejnarova\u0301, 2011]. In all these frameworks the original idea is kept, but there exist some slight differences among these frameworks.\nIn [Vejnarova\u0301, 2013] we introduced a composition operator for credal sets, but due to the problem of discontinuity it needed a revision. After a thorough reconsideration in [Vejnarova\u0301, 2016] we presented a new definition avoiding this discontinuity. We showed that the revised composition operator keeps the basic properties of its counterparts in other frameworks, and therefore it enables us to introduce compositional models for multidimensional credal sets. Nevertheless, a problem how to make practical computations appeared and the need for effective computational procedures became urgent.\nCredal sets are usually defined as convex sets of probability distributions. In finite case, a probability distribution can be represented as a point in a multidimensional space. Credal set \u2014 as a convex set of such points \u2014 can be interpreted as a convex polyhedron in respective space. This naturally leads to computational procedures based on methods used in polyhedral geometry [Gru\u0308nbaum et al., 1967].\nThis contributions is organized as follows. In Section 2 we summarise the basic concepts and notation. The definition of the operator of composition is presented in Section 3, which is devoted also to its basic properties. In Section 4 we describe proposed computational procedures, in Section 5 we illustrate their application on a few simple examples and Section 6 is devoted to implementation."}, {"heading": "2 Basic Concepts and Notation", "text": "In this section we will briefly recall basic concepts and notation necessary for understanding the contribution."}, {"heading": "2.1 Variables and Distributions", "text": "For an index set N = {1, 2, . . . , n} let {Xi}i\u2208N be a system of variables, each Xi having its values in a finite set Xi and XN = X1 \u00d7X2 \u00d7 . . .\u00d7Xn be the Cartesian product of these sets.\nIn this paper we will deal with groups of variables on its subspaces. Let XK will denote a group of variables {Xi}i\u2208K with values in XK =\u00d7i\u2208KXi throughout the paper.\nAny group of variables XK can be described by a probability distribution\n(sometimes also called probability function)\nP : XK \u2212\u2192 [0, 1],\nsuch that \u2211\nxK\u2208XK\nP (xK) = 1.\nHaving two probability distributions P1 and P2 of XK we say that P1 is absolutely continuous with respect to P2 (and denote P1 \u226a P2) if for any xK \u2208 XK\nP2(xK) = 0 =\u21d2 P1(xK) = 0.\nThis concept plays an important role in the definition of the composition operator."}, {"heading": "2.2 Credal Sets", "text": "A credal set M(XK) describing a group of variables XK is usually defined as a closed convex set of probability measures describing the values of these variables. In order to simplify the expression of operations with credal sets, it is often considered [Moral and Cano, 2002] that a credal set is the set of probability distributions associated to the probability measures in it. Under such consideration a credal set can be expressed as a convex hull (denoted by CH) of its extreme distributions (ext)\nM(XK) = CH{ext(M(XK ))}.\nConsider a credal set M(XK). For each L \u2282 K its marginal credal set M(XL) is obtained by element-wise marginalization, i.e.\nM(XL) = CH{P \u2193L : P \u2208 ext(M(XK))}, (1)\nwhere P \u2193L denotes the marginal distribution of P on XL. Besides marginalization we will also need the opposite operation, usually called extension. Vacuous extension of a credal set M(XL) describing XL to a credal set M(XK) = M(XL)\n\u2191K (L \u2282 K) is the maximal credal set describingXK such that M(XK)\n\u2193L = M(XL). A simple example of vacuous extension can be found in Section 5 (Example 5.3).\nHaving two credal sets M1 and M2 describing XK and XL, respectively (assuming that K,L \u2286 N), we say that these credal sets are projective if their marginals describing common variables coincide, i.e. if\nM1(XK\u2229L) = M2(XK\u2229L).\nLet us note that if K and L are disjoint, then M1 and M2 are always projective, as M1(X\u2205) = M2(X\u2205) \u2261 1."}, {"heading": "2.3 Strong Independence", "text": "Among the numerous definitions of independence for credal sets [Couso et al., 1999] we have chosen strong independence, as it seems to be the most appropriate for multidimensional models.\nWe say that (groups of) variables XK and XL (K and L disjoint) are strongly independent with respect to M(XK\u222aL) iff (in terms of probability distributions)\nM(XK\u222aL) = CH{P1 \u00b7 P2 : P1 \u2208 M(XK), P2 \u2208 M(XL)}. (2)\nAgain, there exist several generalizations of this notion to conditional independence, see e.g. [Moral and Cano, 2002], but as the following definition is suggested by the authors as the most appropriate for the marginal problem, it seems to be a suitable concept also in our case, since the operator of composition can also be used as a tool for solution of a marginal problem, as shown (in the framework of possibility theory) e.g. in [Vejnarova\u0301, 2007].\nGiven three groups of variables XK ,XL and XM (K,L,M be mutually disjoint subsets of N , such thatK and L are nonempty), we say that XK and XL are conditionally independent given XM under global set M(XK\u222aL\u222aM ) (to simplify the notation we will denote this relationship by K \u22a5 L|M) iff\nM(XK\u222aL\u222aM ) (3)\n= CH{(P1 \u00b7 P2)/P \u2193M 1 : P1 \u2208 M(XK\u222aM ), P2 \u2208 M(XL\u222aM ), P \u2193M 1 = P \u2193M 2 } .\nThis definition is a generalisation of stochastic conditional independence: ifM(XK\u222aL\u222aM ) is a singleton, thenM(XK\u222aM ) andM(XL\u222aM ) are also (projective) singletons and the definition reduces to the definition of stochastic conditional independence."}, {"heading": "2.4 Polyhedral Geometry", "text": "A convex polytope may be defined in numerous ways, depending on what is more suitable for the problem at hand. Gru\u0308nbaum\u2019s definition [Gru\u0308nbaum et al., 1967] is in terms of a convex set of points in space. Other important definitions are: as the intersection of half-spaces (H-representation) and as the convex hull of a set of vertices (V-representation). For a compact convex polytope, the minimal V-representation is unique and it is given by the set of the vertices of the polytope [Gru\u0308nbaum et al., 1967]. In our experiments, we use both H and V-representations. However, for the purpose of representation of the polytope within the paper only V-representation is used.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, a credal set is a convex polytope (bounded polyhedron) in |XN |-dimensional space. Each dimension corresponds to an element from XN (a combination of the variables N) - i.e. xN \u2208 XN . Vertex v of the space is nothing else than a probability distribution Pv with v[xN ] = Pv(xN ). Following the fact, that probability belongs to unit interval [0, 1], we can restrict the space \u2014 it is, in fact, a hypercube.\nThe nature of the space imposes several restrictions to operations with convex polytopes. We do not consider projections into subspaces. Marginalization of a convex polytope representing a set of probability distributions of XN to XK (K \u2282 N) corresponds to a transformation of |XN |-dimensional space into XK-dimensional space. Naturally, for each vertex this is done by summing of all coordinates from XN with the projection to XK . The similar holds for extensions."}, {"heading": "3 Composition Operator", "text": "In this section we will recall the new definition of composition operator for credal sets introduced in [Vejnarova\u0301, 2016].

Our goal is to define a new credal set, denoted by M1 \u22b2M2, which will describe\nXK\u222aL and will contain all of the information contained in M1 and, as much as possible, from M2. In other words, we want to find a common extension of M1 and M2 (if it is possible).\nThe required properties were already met by Definition 1 in [Vejnarova\u0301, 2013]1. However, that definition exhibits a kind of discontinuity and was thoroughly reconsidered. In [Vejnarova\u0301, 2016] we proposed the following one.\nDefinition 3.1 For two credal sets M1 and M2 describing XK and XL, their composition M1 \u22b2 M2 is defined as a convex hull of probability distributions P obtained as follows. For each couple of distributions P1 \u2208 M1(XK) and P2 \u2208 M2(XL) such that P \u2193K\u2229L 2 \u2208 argmin{Q2 \u2208 M2(XK\u2229L) : d(Q2, P \u2193K\u2229L 1 ), distribution P is obtained by one of the following rules: [a] if P \u2193K\u2229L 1 \u226a P \u2193K\u2229L 2\nP (XK\u222aL) = P1(XK) \u00b7 P2(XL)\nP \u2193K\u2229L 2 (XK\u2229L) .\n[b] otherwise\nP (XK\u222aL) \u2208 ext{P \u2191K\u222aL 1 (XK)}.\nFunction d used in the definition is a suitable distance function. In this paper we use Euclidean distance, as it is natural choice in polyhedral geometry.\nLet us note, that this definition of composition operator does not differ from the original one [Vejnarova\u0301, 2013] in case of projective credal sets, as in this case the only distributions in M1 \u22b2 M2 are those satisfying P = (P1 \u00b7 P2)/P \u2193K\u2229L 2 , where P \u2193K\u2229L 1 = P \u2193K\u2229L 2\n(and those belonging to their convex hull). However, it differs in the remaining cases. It will be illustrated in Section 5 using our computational procedures.\nIn the next subsection we will summarize the most important basic properties of the composition operator."}, {"heading": "3.3 Basic Properties", "text": "The following lemma proven in [Vejnarova\u0301, 2016] suggests that the abovedefined composition operator possesses basic properties required at the beginning of this section. Its last item characterizes condition under which common extension of M1 and M2 can be obtained.\n1Let us note that the definition is based on Moral\u2019s concept of conditional independence\nwith relaxing convexity.\nLemma 3.2 For two credal sets M1 and M2 describing XK and XL, respectively, the following properties hold true:\n1. M1 \u22b2M2 is a credal set describing XK\u222aL.\n2. (M1 \u22b2M2)(XK) = M1(XK).\n3. M1 \u22b2M2 = M2 \u22b2M1 iff M1(XK\u2229L) = M2(XK\u2229L).\nThis lemma, together with the following theorem, proven in [Vejnarova\u0301, 2013], expressing the relationship between strong independence and the operator of composition, are the most important assertions enabling us to introduce compositional models.\nTheorem 3.3 Let M be a credal set describing XK\u222aL with marginals M(XK) and M(XL). Then\nM(XK\u222aL) = (M \u2193K \u22b2M\u2193L)(XK\u222aL)\niff (K \\ L) \u22a5 (L \\K)|(K \u2229 L).\nThis theorem remains valid also for the revised definition of the composition operator, as M(XK) and M(XL) are marginals of M(XK\u222aL), and therefore only [a] (for projective distributions) is applicable.\nBefore closing this section, let us present one more result proven in [Vejnarova\u0301, 2017] concerning the relationship between the original composition operator for precise probabilities and that studied in this contribution.\nLemma 3.4 Let M1(XK) and M2(XL) be two singleton credal sets describing XK and XL, respectively, where M1(XK\u2229L) is absolutely continuous with respect to M2(XK\u2229L). Then (M1\u22b2M2)(XK\u222aL) is also a singleton.\nThe reader should however realize that the definition of the operator of composition for singleton credal sets is not completely equivalent to the definition of composition for probabilistic distributions. They equal each other only in case that the probabilistic version is defined. This is ensured in Lemma 3.4 by assuming the absolute continuity. In case it does not hold, the probabilistic operator is not defined while its credal version introduced in this paper is always defined. However, in this case, the result is not a singleton credal set, as can be seen from Example 5.3 in Section 5."}, {"heading": "4 Computational Procedures for Composition Op-", "text": "erator\nThe experiments were performed in R environment [R Core Team, 2016] using RStudio [RStudio Team, 2015]. To implement polyhedral geometry, we have used rcdd package [Geyer et al., 2016] based on GMP GNU library (The GNUMultiple Precision Arithmetic Library) [Granlund and the GMP development team, 2012].\nFor quadratic programming methods \u2014 i.e. in case of a finding a projection of a given vertex on a certain polytope (we considered Euclidean distance in this paper) \u2014 we have used methods of quadratic programming [Gould and Toint, 2000] implemented in quadprog package [original by Berwin A. Turlach R port by Andreas 2013].\nTo implement various extensions to higher dimensional space \u2014 as described in Definition 3.1 \u2014 we have used the advantage of equivalence of Hand V-representations of convex polytopes. To move from |XN |-dimensional space to |XK |-dimensional space where K \u2282 N we can easily create a 0-1 transformation matrix that allows us to convert an arbitrary vertex from one space to the other one. With the help of such a transformation matrix, a set of related (in)equalities can be transformed as well. This is extremely handy when we need to extend a vertex or a convex polytope from a space to the higher-dimensional one. First, we convert it to its H-representation and then transform it using a transformation matrix to the higher dimensional space.\nTo find a part of a polytope with given projection, it is enough to extend H-projection of the projection to the original space and combine both Hrepresentations (to get the intersection of the polytopes)."}, {"heading": "5 Examples", "text": "In this Section we will demonstrate the application of Definition 1 via our computational procedures. Let us start with the case of projective credal sets.\nExample 5.1 Let M1(X1X2) and M2(X2X3) be credal sets about variables X1X2 and X2X3, respectively, with extreme vertices as listed in Table 1.\nThese two credal sets are projective, as\nM1(X2) = CH{[0.2, 0.8], [0.5, 0.5]} = M2(X2)\nFollowing Definition 1, M1 \u22b2M2 can be expressed as a convex polytope with V-representation defined in Table 2.\nIt can easily be checked that both (M1 \u22b2M2)(X1X2) = M1(X1X2) and (M1 \u22b2M2)(X2X3) = M2(X2X3). \u2666\nHere for any distribution P1(X1X2) in M1 exists (at least one) distribution P2(X2X3) in M2 such that P1(X2) = P2(X2), therefore all the extreme points are obtained as a simple conditional product. In this case, furthermore, M1 \u22b2 M2 = M2 \u22b2 M1, as corresponds to Lemma 3.2 (and can be easily checked).\nThe following example is more complicated, as it deals with non-projective credal sets.\nExample 5.2 Let M1(X1X2) and M2(X2X3) be two credal sets describing binary variables X1X2 and X2X3, respectively, defined as a convex hull of vertices in Table 3.\nThese two credal sets are not projective, as M1(X2) = CH{[0.2, 0.8], [0.6, 0.4]}, while M2(X2) = CH{[0.3, 0.7], [0.5, 0.5]}. Therefore M2(X2) \u2282 M1(X2).\nDefinition 1 in this case leads to a credal set (M1 \u22b2M2)(X1X2X3) with 23 extreme points listed in Table 4. On the other hand (M2 \u22b2M1)(X1X2X3)\nhas 16 extreme points. They are listed in Table 5.\n\u2666\nThis difference deserves a more detailed explanation. Both M1\u22b2M2 and M2\u22b2M1 keep the first marginal, but not the second one (which corresponds to Lemma 3.2).\nThe extreme vertices of marginal of the composition M2 \u22b2M1 of X1X2 are listed in Table 6. Is is not obvious just from the table itself, but the convex polytope corresponding to (M2 \u22b2 M1)(X1X2) is smaller than the one of the original credal set M1(X1X2). Actually, any extreme vertex of (M2 \u22b2M1)(X1X2) is an inner point of M1(X1X2).\nThe opposite inclusion holds for the marginal of the composition M1 \u22b2 M2 of X2X3. The V-representation of respective credal set is given in Table 7. This credal set is bigger than M2(X2X3), i.e., any extreme vertex of M2(X2X3) is contained in (M1 \u22b2M2)(X2X3).\nThe fact that (M2 \u22b2M1)(X1X2) is smaller (more precise) than (M2 \u22b2 M1))(X1X2) corresponds to the idea that we want M2 \u22b2 M1 to keep all the information contained in M2. Therefore, we do not consider those distributions from M1 not corresponding to any from M2 \u2014 although these distributions are taken into account when composing M1 \u22b2M2.\nx2x3 x2x\u03043 x\u03042x3 x\u03042x\u03043 1 0 0.3 0 0.7 2 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 3 0.5 0 0.5 0 4 0 0.2 0 0.8 5 0.133 0.067 0.457 0.343 6 0.6 0 0.4 0 7 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2\nTable 7: (M1 \u22b2M2)(X2X3)\nV-representation of two marginals of composition of M1 and M2 from Example 5.2\nThe last example demonstrates the case, when [b] of Definition 1 is applied. Simultaneously, it is the case, when probabilistic composition operator remains undefined, but composition of two precise probabilities taken as singleton credal sets is defined (and the result is, naturally, a credal set).\nExample 5.3 Let M1(X1X2) and M2(X2X3) be two singleton credal sets describing variables X1X2 and X2X3, respectively. They are defined in Table 8. Let us compute M1 \u22b2 M2. As M1(X2) = {[0.5, 0.5]}, while (M2(X2) = {[1, 0]}, it is evident, that M1 is not absolutely continuous with respect to M2.
