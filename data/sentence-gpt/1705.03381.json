In this note we discuss the important property of the uniqueness of the model.\n\n\n\nThe term uniqueness implies that uniqueness can be derived from a particular object. For instance, there are properties of the model, such as a value of a single instance of a type. For instance, a value of a type is a variable of a type that is a type that has an instance of the class class called that. If we define an instance of the class called that, we can define an instance of the class called that. In a case, we define the class called that.\nWhat is unique about uniqueness is that we can define each of these properties (or not). That means that in a case where our class is a subclass of that class, a value of that class is always a class called that. If that is a subclass of that class, then one property is still a class of that class.\nThe definition of uniqueness is that it is a non-essential property of a model of a class (the type of the model). This is where the model is defined.\nWhat happens when we define a model for the class on which the model is defined? The model is defined.\nThe model is defined.\nWhat happens when we define a model for the class on which the model is defined? The model is defined.\nIn this case, we define a model for the class on which the model is defined. For instance, we define a model for the class on which the model is defined.\nIn a case where our model is defined.\nThe model is defined.\nSo if our model is defined.\nWe define a model for the class on which the model is defined.\nOne example is a model for the class on which the model is defined.\nThe model is defined.\nThat is the definition of uniqueness in a class on which the model is defined.\nIn a case where we define a model for the class on which the model is defined.\nWe define a model for the class on which the model is defined.\nIn a case where we define a model for the class on which the model is defined.\nIn a case where we define a model for the class on which the model is defined.\nTo do this, we can define the model for the class on which the model is defined.\nThe value of uniqueness is that a value of that class is always a class", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 May 2017 15:18:13 GMT  (8kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03381v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["leila amgoud", "elise bonzon", "marco correia", "jorge cruz", "j\\'er\\^ome delobelle", "s\\'ebastien konieczny", "jo\\~ao leite", "alexis martin", "nicolas maudet", "srdjan vesic"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03381"}, "pdf": {"name": "1705.03381.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "A note on the uniqueness of models in social abstract argumentation", "authors": ["Leila Amgoud", "Elise Bonzon", "Marco Correia", "Jorge Cruz", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Delobelle", "S\u00e9bastien Konieczny", "Jo\u00e3o Leite", "Alexis Martin", "Nicolas Maudet", "Srdjan Vesic"], "emails": [], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n03 38\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n9 M\nay 2\n01 7\n1 Introduction\nIn the presence of several conflicting arguments, as is the case for instance in online debate platforms, it is difficult to appreciate which ones are \u201cstronger\u201d or more convincingly defended. This is even more challenging when those arguments can have weights (for instance, providing from votes of the users). To this date, social abstract argumentation [LM11] remains one of the only proposal embracing both aspects of the structural interaction among arguments (attacks), and votes on these arguments. Furthermore, the model has been the subject of an in-depth algorithmic study and experimental evaluation [CCL14], showing that instances of significant size can be handled.\nFormally, a social abstract argumentation framework is defined as a triple \u3008A,R,V\u3009, where A stands for a set of arguments, R \u2286 A\u00d7A for a set of attacks among arguments, and V : A 7\u2192 N\u00d7N a function mapping each arguments to a tuple of pro and con votes (v+ and v\u2212). We denote by R\u2212(a) the set of attacker(s) of an argument a.\nGiven a totally ordered set L containing all possible valuations of an argument, with top (\u22a4) and bottom (\u22a5) elements, finding a social model consists in finding a mapping MS : A \u2192 L of values to arguments satisfying certain constraints induced by the argumentation framework. That is, for all a \u2208 A it must be the case that:\nMS(a) = \u03c4(a)f \u00acg {M(ai) : ai \u2208 R\u2212(a)} (1) where: \u03c4 : A \u2192 L is the social support; f : L\u00d7L \u2192 L combines the initial score with the score of direct attackers; g : L \u00d7 L \u2192 L aggregates the score of direct attackers; and \u00ac : L \u2192 L restricts the value of the attacked argument. For the semantics to be well-behaved, it is required that f is continuous, commutative, associative, monotonic w.r.t. both values and \u22a4 is its identity element; that g is continuous, commutative, associative, monotonic w.r.t. both values and \u22a5 is its identity element; and that \u00ac is antimonotonic, continuous, \u00ac\u22a5 = \u22a4, \u00ac\u22a4 = \u22a5 and \u00ac\u00aca = a. \u03c4 is monotonic w.r.t. the first value and anti-monotonic w.r.t the second value. Most importantly, well-behaved semantics induce at least one social model [LM11, Theorem 12].\nA very important property that the designer may require is the uniqueness of the model, that is, the fact that there exists only one social model satisfying Equation (1). One natural well-behaved social semantics satisfying this under some condition is the simple product semantics, defined as SP\u01eb = \u3008[0, 1], \u03c4\u01eb,f,g,\u00ac\u3009 where \u03c4\u01eb = v +\nv++v\u2212+\u01eb (with \u01eb > 0, and \u03c4\u01eb = 0 when there is no votes), x1 f x2 = x1 \u00d7 x2 (Product T-Norm), x1 g x2 = x1 + x2 \u2212 x1 \u00d7 x2 (Probabilistic Sum T-CoNorm) and \u00acx1 = 1\u2212 x1.\nIndeed, when |R\u2212(a)|\u00d7\u03c4(a) < 1, for all arguments a in the system, the uniqueness of the model can be proven [LM11, Theorem 13]. It is also conjectured [LM11, Conjecture 14] that this simple product models enjoy this property for social abstract argumentation frameworks in general. In this note we show that while the conjecture holds when there are 3 arguments, it does not from 4 arguments onwards (Section 2). We briefly discuss the consequences of this finding in Section 3.\n2 Uniqueness of models only holds up to 3 arguments\nProposition 1. In any social abstract argumentation frameworks \u3008A,R,V\u3009 with |A| \u2264 3, there exists a unique social model.\nProof. We detail the case where A = {a1, a2, a3} and R = A\u00d7A. The other cases are similar and can be derived along the same lines. We will prove that with 0 < a1, a2, a3 < 1, there is a unique solution solution in (0, 1)3 to the system:\n\n \n  x1 = a1 (1\u2212 x2) (1\u2212 x3) x2 = a2 (1\u2212 x1) (1\u2212 x3) x3 = a3 (1\u2212 x1) (1\u2212 x2)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\nLet us consider the case where all a\u2019s are different, without loss of generality a3 < a2 < a1 Multiplying (2) and (3) by (1\u2212 x1) and (1\u2212 x2) respectively, we obtain:\n{ x1 (1\u2212 x1) = a1 (1\u2212 x1) (1\u2212 x2) (1\u2212 x3) x2 (1\u2212 x2) = a2 (1\u2212 x1) (1\u2212 x2) (1\u2212 x3)\ntherefore x1 (1\u2212 x1)\na1 = x2 (1\u2212 x2) a2\nsince x(1 \u2212 x) = 14 \u2212 ( 1 2 \u2212 x )2 we can rewrite the equation as:\na2\na1\n(\n1 4 \u2212 ( 1 2 \u2212 x1 ) 2 ) = ( 1 4 \u2212 ( 1 2 \u2212 x2 ) 2 )\n(5)\nSince we assume that a2 < a1 it must be the case that:\n1 4 \u2212 ( 1 2 \u2212 x1 ) 2 > 1 4 \u2212 ( 1 2 \u2212 x2 ) 2\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x2\n)\n2 >\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n)\n2\n\u221a\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x2\n)\n2 >\n\u221a\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n)\n2\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 1\n2 \u2212 x2\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 > \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 1\n2 \u2212 x1\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 (because \u221a x2 = |x|)\nLet us know prove that x2 < 1 2 . There are two cases for x1:\n\u2022 Case x1 < 12 . Suppose for contradiction that x2 \u2265 12 , therefore we must have \u2223 \u2223 1 2 \u2212 x2 \u2223 \u2223 > \u2223\n\u2223 1 2 \u2212 x1\n\u2223\n\u2223, thus x2 \u2212 12 > 12 \u2212 x1, and finally x2 > 1 \u2212 x1. But this is impossible because x2 = a2 (1\u2212 x1) (1\u2212 x3) Therefore, in this case x2 < 1 2\n\u2022 Case x1 \u2265 12 . In that case we have \u2212x1 \u2264 \u2212 12 , and thus 1\u2212 x1 \u2264 12 . This means that x2 < 12 because x2 = a2 (1\u2212 x1) (1\u2212 x3)\nTherefore, in every case we have that x2 < 1 2 Solving for x2 the equation (5) gives:\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x2\n)\n2 = 1 4 \u2212 a2\na1\n(\n1 4 \u2212 ( 1 2 \u2212 x1 ) 2 )\nx2 = 1 2 \u00b1 \u221a 1 4 \u2212 a2\na1\n(\n1 4 \u2212 ( 1 2 \u2212 x1 ) 2 )\nand since we know that x2 < 1 2 we have:\nx2 = 1 2 \u2212 \u221a 1 4 \u2212 a2\na1\n(\n1 4 \u2212 ( 1 2 \u2212 x1 ) 2 )\nA similar reasoning can be used for x3, therefore, the first equation of the initial system can be rewritten as:\nx1 = a1\n( 1\u2212 ( 1 2 \u2212 \u221a 1 4 \u2212 a2\na1\n(\n1 4 \u2212 ( 1 2 \u2212 x1 ) 2 )\n))( 1\u2212 ( 1 2 \u2212 \u221a 1 4 \u2212 a3\na1\n(\n1 4 \u2212 ( 1 2 \u2212 x1 ) 2 )\n))\n= a1\n(\n1 2 +\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a2\na1\n(\n1 4 \u2212 ( 1 2 \u2212 x1 ) 2 )\n)(\n1 2 +\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a3\na1\n(\n1 4 \u2212 ( 1 2 \u2212 x1 ) 2 )\n)\nLet f be the real variable function defined over (0, 1):\nf (x1) = a1\n(\n1 2 +\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a2\na1\n(\n1 4 \u2212 ( 1 2 \u2212 x1 ) 2 )\n)(\n1 2 +\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a3\na1\n(\n1 4 \u2212 ( 1 2 \u2212 x1 ) 2 )\n)\nAny real value r1 with 0 < r1 < 1 that satisfies the equation r1 = f (r1) determines one solution of the system:\n\u3008x1, x2, x3\u3009 = \u2329 r1, 1 2 \u2212 \u221a 1 4 \u2212 a2\na1\n(\n1 4 \u2212 ( 1 2 \u2212 r1 ) 2 ) , 1 2 \u2212 \u221a 1 4 \u2212 a3\na1\n(\n1 4 \u2212 ( 1 2 \u2212 r1 ) 2 )\n\u232a\nLet us now prove that there exists one and only one value for 0 < r1 < 1 that satisfies equation r1 = f (r1). f is a continuous function defined over [0, 1] (its roots always have positive values in this interval). The derivative f \u2032 (x1) of the function is:\n\u2212 a2\n(\n1 2 +\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a3 a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n)\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n)\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a2 a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n\u2212 a3\n(\n1 2 +\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a2 a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n)\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n)\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a3 a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n\u2022 if x1 < 12 both terms are negative and f \u2032 (x1) < 0 (f is decreasing in [ 0, 12 )\n\u2022 if x1 = 12 both terms are zero and f \u2032 (x1) = 0(f ( 1 2 ) is smaller value f in [0, 1])\n\u2022 if x1 > 12 both terms are positive and f \u2032 (x1) > 0 (f is increasing in ( 1 2 , 1 ] )\nEvaluating the function in its significant points, we get that:\n\u2022 f(0) = a1\n\u2022 f ( 1 2 ) = a1\n(\n1 2 + 1 2\n\u221a 1\u2212 a2a1 )( 1 2 + 1 2 \u221a 1\u2212 a3a1 )\n\u2022 f(1) = a1 The second derivative of the function is:\nf \u201d (x1) = a2\n(\n1 2 +\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a3a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n)\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a2a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n\u2212 a2\n2 (\n1 2 +\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a3a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n)\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n)\n2\na1\n(\n1 4 \u2212 a2a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n)\n3/2\n+ a3\n(\n1 2 +\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a2a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n)\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a3a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n\u2212 a3\n2 (\n1 2 +\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a2a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n)\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n)\n2\na1\n(\n1 4 \u2212 a3a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n)\n3/2\n+ 2a2a3\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n)\n2\na1\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a2a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a3a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\nf \u201d (x1) = a2\n(\n1 2 +\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a3 a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n)\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a2 a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n 1\u2212 a2 ( 1 2 \u2212 x1 ) 2\na1\n(\n1 4 \u2212 a2a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n)\n\n\n+ a3\n(\n1 2 +\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a2 a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n)\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a3 a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n 1\u2212 a3 ( 1 2 \u2212 x1 ) 2\na1\n(\n1 4 \u2212 a3a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n)\n\n\n+ 2a2a3\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n)\n2\na1\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a2a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n\u221a\n1 4 \u2212 a3a1\n(\n1 4 \u2212\n(\n1 2 \u2212 x1\n) 2 )\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\nLet us now inspect the terms of this expression.

Note that any solution to the equation in [0, 1] corresponds to an intersection point between the straight line y = x and the curve y = f(x). Both functions are continuous and are defined over the entire interval [0, 1]. At one end of the interval, with x = 0, the value of y = 0 that satisfies the equation of the straight line is inferior to the value of y = f(0) = a1 that satisfies the equation of the curve (the straight line is below the curve at the point x = 0). At the other end of the interval, with x = 1, the value of y = 1 that satisfies the equation of the straight line is superior to the value of y = f(1) = a1 that satisfies the equation of the curve (the straight line is above the curve at the point x = 1). Since both the\nstraight line and the curve are continuous, there has to be at least one point in which they cross, i.e.: \u2203r\u2208(0,1)r = f(r)\nWe shall now prove that in (0, 1) there exists at most one solution to the equation x1 = f (x1). Note that the function f is strictly convex in [0, 1] since its second derivative is always positive in all points of the interval. Being convex in [0, 1] we know that:\n\u2022 \u2200x1 6=x2\u2208[0,1]\u2200t\u2208(0,1)f (tx2 + (1\u2212 t)x1) < tf (x2) + (1\u2212 t)f (x1)\n\u2022 \u2200x1 6=x2\u2208[0,1]\u2200t\u2208(0,1)f (x1 + t (x2 \u2212 x1)) < f (x1) + t (f (x2)\u2212 f (x1))\nInformally, the previous inequality establishes that the value of the function in any point between x1 and x2 is strictly smaller than the value of the point in the straight line conecting x1 to x2. Let x1 = r1 be the smaller value of x1 that satisfies the equation r1 = f (r1) (we already established that there exists at least one). If r1 is the smaller value that satisfies the equation, then there are no additional solutions with values of x1 \u2208 (0, r1). Let x2 = 1, through the inequality above we have:\n\u2200t\u2208(0,1)f (r1 + t (1\u2212 r1)) < f (r1) + t (f(1)\u2212 f (r1)) < f (r1) + t (a1 \u2212 f (r1)) (because f(1) = a1) < r1 + t (a1 \u2212 r1) (because f (r1) = r1) < r1 + t (1\u2212 r1) (because a1 < 1)\nThrough the previous inequality we know that no value of x1 \u2208 (r1, 1) can satisfy equation x1 = f (x1). Therefore, r1 is the only solution in (0, 1), so there exists one and only one solution to equation x1 = f (x1) in this interval. Consequently, there is also one and only one solution of the original system in (0, 1)3.\nThe question is thus whether the same property holds for a larger number of arguments, as conjectured in [LM11]. It turns out that, from 4 arguments, several social models may exist.\nExample 1 (Non-uniqueness of models). The example involves four arguments involved in pairwise reciprocal attacks, as illustrated (see Figure 1).\nTo compute the score of each argument, we will use the simple product semantics introduced as a well-behaved SAF semantics in [LM11]. Recall that the vote aggregation function \u03c4\u01eb (with \u01eb > 0) corresponds to the proportionality of positive votes by the total number of votes on an argument. Thus, by taking \u01eb = 0.1, the social support of all the arguments is: \u03c4\u01eb(a) = \u03c4\u01eb(b) = \u03c4\u01eb(c) = \u03c4\u01eb(d) =\n1 1+0+\u01eb = 1 1.1 \u2248 0.909. Let us now write the equation system (with one equation for each argument) from the AF illustrated in Figure 1.\n{\nM(a) = M(c) = 11.1 \u00d7 (1\u2212 (M(b) +M(d)\u2212M(b)\u00d7M(d))) M(b) = M(d) = 11.1 \u00d7 (1\u2212 (M(a) +M(c)\u2212M(a)\u00d7M(c)))\n{\nM(a) = M(c) = 11.1 \u00d7 (1\u2212 (2M(b)\u2212M(b)2)) = 11.1 \u00d7 (1\u2212 (2M(d)\u2212M(d)2)) M(b) = M(d) = 11.1 \u00d7 (1\u2212 (2M(a)\u2212M(a)2)) = 11.1 \u00d7 (1\u2212 (2M(c)\u2212M(c)2))\nIt can be checked that this equation system has three distinct valid models which lead to different rankings:\n3 Discussion\nWe conclude by briefly discussing the consequences of this result. One possible way to ensure the uniqueness of the model would be to normalize the values, for instance by dividing the initial social support \u03c4(a) of all arguments by the overall number of arguments in the system, thus making sure that |R\u2212(a)| \u00d7 \u03c4(a) < 1, compute the model (and multiply again). When one is only interested in the rankings of arguments (i.e. not in their absolute values), this is a sufficient repair strategy.\nHowever, this normalization implies that some desirable properties (which were previously satisfied by social abstract argumentation frameworks, at least in the restricted setting of a unique positive vote, see [BDKM16]) would now be falsified. One of these properties \u2013satisfied by many of the existing semantics\u2013 is the property of \u201cOrdinal Independence\u201d [ABN16]. It says that the ranking between two arguments should be independent of arguments that are not connected to either of them. The following example shows that it cannot be guaranteed any longer.\nExample 2 (Ordinal independence is not satisfied). We first consider the situation where there are 6 arguments. We shall focus here on the value of some argument in the cycle (a, b, c), say a, as compared to the value of argument f .\na\n(1, 0)\nb (1, 0)\nc\n(1, 0)\nd\n(1, 0)\ne\n(1, 0)\nf (5, 0)\nComputing the values (again in using the simple product semantics with \u01eb = 0.1) gives M(a) = 0.7074 and M(f) = 0.7058, hence a \u227b f . But now suppose there are 1000 more \u2013completely unrelated\u2013 arguments. By using the same method, we get that M(a) = 0.9074, while M(f) = 0.97, hence f \u227b a. The addition of these arguments have modified the relative ranking of a and f .\nReferences\n[ABN16] Leila Amgoud and Jonathan Ben-Naim. Axiomatic foundations of acceptability semantics.
