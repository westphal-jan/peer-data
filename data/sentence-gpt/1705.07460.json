However, in real world, rewards are emergent phenomena from the complex interactions between agents and environments. In this paper, we propose an implicit generic reward model for reinforcement learning. Unlike those rewards that are manually defined for specific tasks, such implicit reward is task independent. It only comes from the deviation from the agents' previous experiences. In this example, an agent's previous experiences are used only to reward the target. In order to evaluate the effect of implicit reward on the target, we use the standard method of reinforcement learning (HST).

In recent years, the field of reinforcement learning has been greatly advanced thanks to the revolutions in big data machine learning techniques, especially deep learning [1]. Supervised deep learning enabled the learning of complex rules among large amount of training data. Unsupervised deep learning techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) [2] has been shown to be able to capture the intrinsic distribution on the manifold among images. The use of deep learning for learning value function, policy and model has greatly advanced reinforcement learning field [3]. For example, deep reinforcement learning techniques have been used for playing Atari games and outperformed human experts [5]. Most notably, deep reinforcement learning techniques have also outperformed world champion on playing GO game [6], which has been computationally infeasible through conventional searching techniques due to its huge search space.\nGenerally a reinforcement learning algorithm aim at maximizing a manually defined long term cumulative reward score that is specific to a particular task. However, in real world, rewards are spontaneous emergent phenomena. Therefore, it is appealing to design general purpose agents to reply on an implicate reward that does not rely on specific tasks, and in\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n07 46\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\nthe same time, as a side product, can spontaneously produce the intuitive rewards that come from specific tasks.

Such implicate reward is modeled by the enrichment of experience of the agent."}, {"heading": "2 Construction of implicate reward model", "text": "We define the \u201cexperience\u201d of an agent as a subsequence of action-observation pairs. For the operational advantage, the length of the subsequence is fixed. Denote the space of experiences as E. Denote S \u2282 E to be a sample of previous experiences collected by the agent through its interactions with environment. To model the enrichment of experiences, we first learn a low dimension representation of S using unsupervised learning, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) [2]. Denote Rm as a Euclidean space for reduced representation of S. Such unsupervised learning results in a mappingM : Rm \u2192 E that maps a simple multidimensional distribution D (such as m dimensional Gaussian distribution) to the distribution that generates S. We then construct an inverse mapping M\u22121 : E \u2192 Rm through regression using sample pairs (M(r), r \u223c D), where r \u2208 Rm is drawn from D. We then construct a probability density estimation pM\u22121(S) : Rm \u2192 [0,+ inf) using points in M\u22121(S). The implicate reward r(e) for any experience e \u2208 E will be calculated according to pM\u22121(S)(M \u22121(e)). A lower pM\u22121(S)(M \u22121(e)) should result in a higher reward r(e).

Most of current reinforcement learning algorithms can be easily adapted to use the above defined implicate reward in place of the explicate manually defined specific reward obtained from specific environment. However, the reward model r needs to be periodically reconstructed using re-sampled S. An on-line or on-fly reconstruction approach would be beneficial."}, {"heading": "3 Discussion", "text": "We expect such a purely curious agent using such implicate generic reward would be able to learn to play certain computer games without knowing the beginning, ending, scores from the game. This is because, intuitively, there is a correlation between the richness of the agent\u2019s experience and the agent\u2019s ability to play a game: in order to obtain an enriched experience, an agent needs to win current level and enter the next level. To mimic people getting richer experience when growing up in the real world, computer games are often designed to introduce new observational (visual and others) experiences in the next level. And the difficulty of a level is often correlated with the complexity of experiences. The pursuit of richer experience is analogous to a free will, the agent would learn how to adapt to environmental constrains and make use of different kinds of resources to survive in order to get a richer experience introduced in the next game level. Even if a computer game does not introduce any significantly new observational experience in the next level, the scores shown on the screen will still be different than previous levels, which may result in a small amount of implicate reward as defined in the method section."}], "references": [{"title": "Deep Learning", "author": ["Ian Goodfellow", "Yoshua Bengio", "Aaron Courville"], "venue": "http://www.deeplearningbook.org", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Generative adversarial nets", "author": ["Ian Goodfellow", "Jean Pouget-Abadie", "Mehdi Mirza", "Bing Xu", "David Warde-Farley", "Sherjil Ozair", "Aaron Courville", "Yoshua Bengio"], "venue": "In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2014}, {"title": "Deep reinforcement learning: An overview", "author": ["Yuxi Li"], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1701.07274,", "citeRegEx": "3", "shortCiteRegEx": "3", "year": 2017}, {"title": "Researchdoom and cocodoom: Learning computer vision with games", "author": ["A Mahendran", "H Bilen", "JF Henriques", "A Vedaldi"], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.02431,", "citeRegEx": "4", "shortCiteRegEx": "4", "year": 2016}, {"title": "Playing atari with deep reinforcement learning", "author": ["Volodymyr Mnih", "Koray Kavukcuoglu", "David Silver", "Alex Graves", "Ioannis Antonoglou", "Daan Wierstra", "Martin Riedmiller"], "venue": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.5602,", "citeRegEx": "5", "shortCiteRegEx": "5", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Mastering the game of go with deep neural networks and tree", "author": ["David Silver", "Aja Huang", "Chris J Maddison", "Arthur Guez", "Laurent Sifre", "George Van Den Driessche", "Julian Schrittwieser", "Ioannis Antonoglou", "Veda Panneershelvam", "Marc Lanctot"], "venue": "search.
