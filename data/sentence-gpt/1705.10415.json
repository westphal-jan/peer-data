Recently, advancements in the latter task have been achieved by using complex networks (Antiqueira et al., 2006; Amancio et al., 2011; Lahiri and Mihalcea, 2013; Marinho et al., 2016; Akimushkin et al., 2017).\nThe network models used in many of these works are based on word co-occurrence. In this\napproach, each distinct word is represented by a node, and edges connect adjacent words. Although this networked representation has proven successful in many tasks, it is not without its share of problems. Co-occurrence networks do not portray the topical structure found in many texts and are usually devoid of community structure (de Arruda et al., 2016). In order to overcome this disadvantage, some techniques have been devoted to the mesoscopic representation of texts (de Arruda et al., 2016, 2017). de Arruda et al. (2017) proposed a novel networked model, in which each node represents a respective set of consecutive paragraphs, while weighted edges express the similarity between nodes. Their proposed network is able to extract the organization and flow of text by effectively capturing the similarity between the blocks of text. In addition, their method was employed to distinguish between real and shuffled texts. However, mesoscopic networks have not been applied to tackle other NLP tasks.\nMost researchers in the field of authorship attribution assume that each author has a signature (known as authorial fingerprint) that distinguishes his/her writing from the others (Juola, 2006). So inspired, we decided to test the hypothesis that these authorial fingerprints are also visible at a mesoscopic scale. At this scale, distinctive graphical patterns of the course of the text emerge, akin to a \u201cdiscourse calligraphy\u201d of the author. Thus, in order to classify texts according to their authorship, we created mesoscopic networks from texts and employed a set of topological measurements. In particular, the main goal of this paper is to probe whether the authors\u2019 writing styles correlate with the story flow of their books.\nThis paper is structured as follows: Section 2 briefly describes the problem and some complex network approaches for authorship attribu-\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n10 41\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n9 M\nay 2\n01 7\ntion.

The obtained results are reported in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 outlines our conclusions and prospects for future work."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Authorship attribution methods attempt to find the most likely author of a document (Stamatatos, 2009). Since the seminal work conducted by Mosteller and Wallace (1964), authorship attribution has been a widely studied problem and several different approaches have been proposed. One of the first approaches consisted in analyzing the frequency of common words, such as to or the, in order to classify political essays according to their authorship (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964).\nSince then, Mosteller and Wallace (1964)\u2019s method has been enhanced to incorporate different attributes capable of qualifying writing styles. These include lexical, character, syntactic, and semantic features (Stamatatos, 2009). Simple lexical and character features (e.g. frequency and burstiness of words and characters, average lengths of texts, and others) have been used in several works, as reported by Grieve (2007), Koppel et al. (2009), and Stamatatos (2009). Most of these works have achieved good results by using, for example, the frequency of stopwords. Examples of syntactic information include the frequencies of POS tags and constituency-based parsing tree rules (Baayen et al., 1996; Gamon, 2004; Hirst and Feiguina, 2007). Finally, semantic features can be extracted from semantic dependency graphs and from the semantic roles associated with some words (Gamon, 2004; Argamon et al., 2007).\nThe usage of network analysis in authorship attribution has already been studied from different perspectives. Antiqueira et al. (2006), one of the first works in the area, extracted some measurements from co-occurrence networks and discovered that these could be used to characterize the writing style of authors. Amancio et al. (2011) combined network measurements with the distribution of words to characterize the authorship of several books. Lahiri and Mihalcea (2013) carried out an in-depth authorship attribution study using more than 100 features extracted from cooccurrence networks. They found that local fea-\ntures (those extracted from individual nodes) outperform global features in the authorship attribution problem.\nApart from using traditional network measurements, the frequency of network motifs involving three nodes (Milo et al., 2002) was found useful to characterize the writing style (Marinho et al., 2016). Instead of considering the text as a static structure, Akimushkin et al. (2017) studied the topology evolution of co-occurrence networks extracted from different sections of the text. Unlike most of the previous mentioned works, in which stopwords are usually removed, Segarra et al. (2013) proposed an authorship attribution method based on networks formed only by stopwords."}, {"heading": "3 Methods", "text": "In this section, we describe the process to create mesoscopic networks from raw texts. We also detail the network measurements and machine learning methods."}, {"heading": "3.1 Mesoscopic Approach", "text": "There are several ways to represent texts as complex networks, such as co-occurrence, syntactic, semantic or similarity networks (Mihalcea and Radev, 2011; Cong and Liu, 2014). In this study, we adopt the mesoscopic network approach proposed by de Arruda et al. (2017). Such networks are able to represent the text unfolding along time, which is normally overlooked by traditional approaches. Moreover, these networks were used to classify documents between real and shuffled texts, using only simple statistics. The high accuracy rate obtained in that classification task led us to infer that mesoscopic networks are able to represent structural aspects of real texts, such as the organization and development of the author\u2019s idea.\nIn order to create the network from a given text (T ), some preprocessing steps can be applied. In our study, we removed the stopwords, and the remaining words were lemmatized. Figure 1 illustrates the methodology used to create mesoscopic networks. In the first step, shown in Figure 1(a), the text is partitioned into a set of paragraphs, T = (p0, p1, p2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), where pi is a sequence of the preprocessed words belonging to the same paragraph i. Different from the co-occurrence networks, where nodes represent words, in mesoscopic networks nodes encompass sequences of \u2206 consecutive paragraphs. More\nspecifically, each possible subsequent set with \u2206 paragraphs, W\u2206i = (pi, pi+1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , pi+\u2206\u22121), represents a network node, as shown in Figure 1(b).\nSo as to account for the importance of the words in a given paragraph, we applied the tf-idf (Manning and Schu\u0308tze, 1999) statistics, which was originally proposed to quantify the importance of a given word w in a document d given a corpus D. A tf-idf(w, d,D) map is computed as\ntf-idf(w, d,D) = fw,d n \u00d7 log ( |D| dw ) , (1)\nwhere fw,d is the frequency of word w in the document d, n is the total number of words in the document d, |D| represents the total number of documents and dw is the number of documents in which w occurs at least once. In order to apply the tf-idf measurement, we considered all the possible windows of subsequent paragraphs, W\u2206i , as the set of documents D (see Figure 1(c)). Finally, for each pair of nodes i and j, a respective edge is created and its weight is calculated according to the cosine similarity between tf-idf(W\u2206i , T ) and tf-idf(W\u2206j , T ), where tf-idf(W \u2206 i , T ) is a tfidf vector of all words, computed from a given set of paragraphs W\u2206i . This step is illustrated in Figure 1(d).\nIn order to convert the network from weighted to unweighted, the edges with the lowest weights can be removed, as described in Section 3.2. It should be noted that edges originating from adja-\ncent paragraphs tend to have higher weights because of the implied overlap. Figure 1(e) shows an example of unweighted network. In our experiment, we set \u2206 = 20, as empirically determined elsewhere (de Arruda et al., 2017)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Network Pruning", "text": "Mesoscopic networks are complete weighted graphs, i.e. every node is connected to every other node (Newman, 2010). In this paper, we repeatedly removed the edges with the lowest weights until each network reached a fixed network average degree \u3008k\u3009. The average degree of a network g, with E edges and N nodes, is defined as\n\u3008k\u3009 = 2 \u2217 E N . (2)\nWe used several values of \u3008k\u3009, ranging from 5 to 50, by steps of 5."}, {"heading": "3.3 Network Measurements", "text": "The following network measurements were extracted from the networks1. Most of these measurements (apart from assortativity) apply to a single node. So, in order to obtain more global characterization, we calculated the average, standard deviation and skewness (third moment) of each distribution. The obtained statistics from these distributions were then used as features in the machine learning methods.\n1For most of these measurements, we used the Igraph software package (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006)\nDegree: The degree quantifies the number of connections of a node (Costa et al., 2007). Even though the average degree of all networks is the same as a consequence of network pruning, the degree of each node may still vary inside the network. Therefore, we used the standard deviation and skewness of this measurement, disregarding the average.\nAverage Degree of Neighbors: The average degree of neighbors (Pastor-Satorras et al., 2001) quantifies how well connected are the neighbors of a node.\nAssortativity: As described by Newman (2003), the assortativity quantifies how likely it is for a given node to connect to other nodes with similar degree. Lower than zero values of assortativity are obtained when a node tends to connect to others with very different degrees. When a node connects only to others with the same degree, the assortativity becomes one. Null assortativity indicates that there is no correlation.\nClustering Coefficient: This measurement reflects how well interconnected are the neighbors of a given node (Watts and Strogatz, 1998).\nAccessibility (h = {2, 3}): The accessibility of a node i is based on Shannon\u2019s entropy (Shannon and Weaver, 1963) of the probability of accessing nodes at the hth concentric level, centered at i, by a given dynamics starting at that node (Travenc\u0327olo and Costa, 2008). Here, we adopted the selfavoiding random walk as the reference dynamics.\nSymmetry (h = {2, 3, 4}): This measurement (Silva et al., 2016b), obtained for each node i, quantifies the symmetry of the topology around i. It can be understood as a normalization of the accessibility, and includes two components: backbone, where edges between nodes from the same concentric level are discarded, and merged, where nodes that share edges in the same level are merged.\nNetwork visualization can provide means to better understand the structure of a given book\u2019s story by organizing, into an embedding space, the topology of the obtained network. We applied a visualization methodology based on force-directed graph drawing (Silva et al., 2016a). Specifically, this method is based on the Fruchterman and Reingold (1991) (FR) algorithm, which simulates a system of particles, which attract and repel one another. The attractive force, fa, reflects the node connectivity, while the repulsive force, fr, acts\nbetween all pair of nodes. A gravitational force, fg, can also be added. We adopted fa = 0.0002, fr = 1.25, and fg = 0.001."}, {"heading": "3.4 Machine Learning Methods", "text": "Several classifiers \u2014 Decision Trees, Random Forest, kNN, Logistic Regressors, SVM, Naive Bayes (Duda et al., 2000) \u2014 were tested in order to choose the most adequate. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest were selected. We used the Linear SVM implementation (with default parameters), and Random Forest with 50 trees, both available at Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011). We employed the leave-oneout cross-validation technique, in which only one dataset instance is used as test while all the others are taken for training the classifier. Feature selection was attempted, but no particular subset of features stood out. Therefore, all measurements were considered."}, {"heading": "4 Results and Discussion", "text": "In this section, we describe the selected dataset and present the obtained results organized in two parts: (i) the complete set of authors; and (ii) four authors representing major types of works."}, {"heading": "4.1 Dataset", "text": "In order to investigate whether authors can be distinguished by the story flow in their works, we created mesoscopic networks from several texts. Our dataset is composed of 100 English texts written by 20 distinct authors (five texts per author) extracted from Machicao et al. (2016). The selected 20 authors are: Andrew Lang, Arthur Conan Doyle, B. M. Bower, Bram Stoker, Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Edgar Allan Poe, H. G. Wells, Hector H. Munro (Saki), Henry James, Herman Melville, Horatio Alger, Jane Austen, Mark Twain, Nathaniel Hawthorne, P. G. Wodehouse, Richard Harding Davis, Thomas Hardy, Washington Irving, and Zane Grey. The whole dataset was obtained from the Project Gutenberg repository2. The complete list of used texts is presented in Table 2."}, {"heading": "4.2 Complete Set of Authors", "text": "In the first experiment, we used all the books by all 20 authors, yielding the results presented in Table 1. Remarkably, though the chance baseline\n2Project Gutenberg - https://www.gutenberg.org/\nfor this experiment is only 5% (each author has the same probability of being randomly selected), our best result was as high as 35%. Moreover, 17 (48.5%) out of the 35 books correctly classified by our method were written by only 4 authors: namely Andrew Lang, B. M. Bower, Hector H. Munro (Saki), and Henry James\nWe also performed a pairwise classification. The obtained results were compared with a traditional approach usually employed in the literature, the analysis of the most frequent words. For this experiment, we used the original texts of each book, extracted the frequency of the 20 most frequent words, and then used a SVM classifier. Figure 2 shows the accuracies for the traditional features, and Figure 3 illustrates the pairwise classification accuracies when mesoscopic networks were used to model each text, we did not select a single average degree \u3008k\u3009, but rather we combined all the degrees listed in Table 1. The accuracies were obtained with the SVM classifier.\nA careful examination of Figure 2 and 3 reveals that for some cases, except the squares with lighter colors, our results are on par with those obtained with the frequency of the 20 most frequent words (mainly stopwords). Moreover, our method even achieved higher accuracies in some combinations. See, for example, authors Grey and Munro, for which 7 and 6, respectively, of our results were better than the traditional approach. One thing that we should note, and which will be revisited in the following subsection, is the fact that it is hard for mesoscopic networks to distinguish Edgar Allan Poe from Charles Darwin. In this case, we obtained an accuracy rate of 50%, contrasted to 80%\nachieved by the other approach."}, {"heading": "4.3 Small Set of Authors", "text": "Out of the 20 authors considered in the previous subsection, we selected four authors, namely Charles Darwin, Thomas Hardy, Edgar Allan Poe, and Mark Twain. They were chosen because two of them have several novels (Thomas Hardy and Mark Twain), Edgar Allan Poe is best known for writing short stories and Charles Darwin wrote about his scientific theories and observations. The now obtained accuracy rate in classifying them was enhanced to 65% (Random Forests) and 50% (SVM) by using the mesoscopic representation, contrasted to the chance baseline of 25% obtained for four authors. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Jolliffe, 2002) considering these four authors is presented in Figure 4.\nThe PCA results indicate a clear partitioning between the groups of books associated to each author. Remarkably, one of Thomas Hardy\u2019s book (A Changed Man and Other Tales) resulted between those of Edgar Allan Poe and Charles Darwin. Such a good partitioning is a consequence of the quite different mesoscopic networks obtained for these authors, as depicted in Figure 5.\nThe mesoscopic networks presented in Figure 5 unveil interesting aspects, including an unexpected similarity to intricate calligraphic shapes. Note that the books which contain tales or short stories, such as those by Edgar Allan Poe, as well as the book A Changed Man and Other Tales, present a similar chain-like topology with a few cycles. Moreover, most of these cycles appear at a relatively small scale. Interestingly, the scientific books of Charles Darwin also present this chainlike structure, which is probably related to the nature of his writings, describing his theories, observations, and findings.\nIt is clear, visually, that the other books present more complex stories, where paragraphs (nodes) from different parts of the book sharing similar content resulted in intersections. For example, the book Adventures of Huckleberry Finn tells the story of Huckleberry Finn traveling down the Mississippi river. During most of the book, he goes through different small adventures along the river. Another interesting point is that this book ends in a similar setting as it begins, when Huckleberry Finn returns to his city, which is reflected in the respective return of the unfolding trajectory to its\nbeginning. It is important to highlight that a full visual analysis with all the 20 authors was beyond the scope of this experiment. Our primary goal was to perform a preliminary investigation of the books through geometrical approaches."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusion", "text": "Complex network methods have been applied with growing success to several natural language processing tasks. In some of these approaches, a chunk of text is represented as a co-occurrence network, which reflects the syntactic relationship between words (Cancho and Sole\u0301, 2001). Although this is a well-known representation, it is not without its share of problems. Those networks, for example, are unable to represent the topical structure found in many texts. So as to overcome such a limitation, a mesoscopic representation has been recently proposed (de Arruda et al., 2017). The main goal of that approach was to take into account the semantical relationship between chunks of text. More specifically, the network nodes correspond to texts from consecutive paragraphs, while the edges are weighted by\nthe similarity between the respective texts. Statistics of some local topological measurements were used to characterize books\u2019 mesoscopic networks. We tested the hypothesis that such a representation is useful at assigning the authorship to documents. In particular, we advocated that fingerprints left by each author are visible at a mesoscopic scale.\nThe obtained accuracy rates, which in one case surpassed by 40 percentage points the chance baseline, suggest that the proposed approach is capable of revealing writing styles characteristics. In addition, we performed an alternative classification, in which all pairs of distinct authors were considered. In some cases our method provided better results than those obtained with traditional features. Such a result indicates that features obtained from mesoscopic networks can be used as a complement to more traditional features of texts. In order to better understand the unfolding of texts, we selected authors whose works include short stories, novels, and scientific writing. A set of topological features was estimated and PCA projected. Interestingly, in this projected space, a book of tales written by Thomas Hardy resulted\ncloser to Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s books, which are also composed of short stories. Even more surprising, the patterns obtained by the visualization resulted quite representative of the different types of works, suggesting a \u201ccalligraphy\u201d. Such visualizations reveal intricate discourse patterns in the books.\nThe goal of this paper was not to provide stateof-the-art results for authorship attribution, given that most traditional approaches in the literature have achieved results as high as 90% (Grieve, 2007; Koppel et al., 2009). Instead, we report an approach that can be used to obtain novel stylometric features, as well as to complement traditional methods.\nFuture works could apply a similar approach to other related tasks \u2014 such as authorship verification, plagiarism detection, and topic segmentation \u2014 and also extend the mesoscopic representation to include different granularity levels, such as sentences or chapters. Another possibility is to investigate the relationship between the emotional content of a text and its topology."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "V.Q.M. and D.R.A. acknowledge financial support from Sa\u0303o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) (grant no. 15/05676-8, 16/19069-9).
