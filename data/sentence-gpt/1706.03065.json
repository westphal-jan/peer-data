Basic balanced structures and combinatorial balanced problems are briefly described. A special attention is targeted to various balance/unbalance indices (including some new versions of the indices): by cluster cardinality, by cluster weights, by inter-cluster edge/arc weights, by cluster element structure (for element multi-type clustering) and a large set of nested combinatorial relationships. The primary focus is on the relationship between order and covariance. It's usually more about the number of values, and it takes several months for it to get to the point where it will take a bit of time. We see clustering problems when calculating a linear relationship (like in this example of a linear distribution: the relationship between order and covariance) and that of randomness. These problems are much simpler to deal with than just randomness, but they are so much more complex than what I have been doing here. To avoid randomness, we have to consider the properties of each and every single relationship. I've used a simple formula (one-dimensional) to construct a random-state graph for the number of variables and to simplify the problem by using a number of columns. For example, we use a single-dimensional one-dimensional, continuous function. Since a large number of variables are variable in a given set, I would use a regular function instead. As a result, we have a very small number of variables in a single-dimensional one-dimensional set, which is the same as a linear, linear, and continuous function.\n\nOne example of a linear problem can be explained by the fact that the sum of all values is constant at all times. For instance, it is easy to compute a positive value of 3 (0x2, 3x1) from the sum of 3,000 values. For example, a number of positive values of 3,000 values can be expressed by one of 2. But, as a result, the sum of all values is constant at all times. For example, the sum of all values is constant at all times. For example, the sum of all values is constant at all times. For example, the sum of all values is constant at all times. For example, the sum of all values is constant at all times.\nThe main problem with linear systems is the relationship between order and covariance. It can be described as a relationship between order and covariance, since the number of values is constant at all times.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Jun 2017 19:34:58 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03065v1", "21 pages, 17 figures, 14 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "21 pages, 17 figures, 14 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI", "authors": ["mark sh levin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03065"}, "pdf": {"name": "1706.03065.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": null, "authors": [], "emails": ["mslevin@acm.org"], "sections": [{"heading": null, "text": "ar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n03 06\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.D S]\n9 J\nun 2\n01 7 Towards balanced clustering - part 1 (preliminaries) Mark Sh.

Introduction", "text": "Balancing processes play central roles in many theoretical and practical fields (Fig. 1) [9,10,12,31,35, 36,40,54,56,61,91,93,110,120,129,134,139,150]. The corresponding balancing problems are basic ones in various engineering domains, for example: manufacturing systems, computing systems, power/electricity systems, radio engineering systems, communication systems, and civil engineering systems. Similar balancing problems are examined in engineering management (e.g., coordination science), communications (e.g., synchronization as time-based balancing), organization science, psychology. In recent decades, the balancing approaches are very significant from the viewpoint of system modularity [16,65,86,103,112].\n\u2217Mark Sh. Levin: Inst. for Inform. Transmission Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences; http://www.mslevin.iitp.ru; email: mslevin@acm.org\nThe basic balancing problem consists in partitioning the element set (while taking into account element parameters, structure over the elements) into interconnected element groups (clusters) which are balanced (by cardinality of cluster elements, weight of cluster as a total weight of cluster elements, weight of cluster interconnections, structure of cluster, etc.). A general framework of balancing problems domain is depicted in Fig. 2.\nIt is reasonable to point out the following main application domains with using the balanced structures: 1. hierarchical organization of storage and search processes in information systems and in computer systems (e.g., various balanced search trees BSTs: AVL trees, red-black trees, splay trees) [2,13,88,93, 103,106,143];\n2. balanced parallel scheduling of computing processes (e.g., computing in multi-processor systems, distributed computing) [12,31,145];\n3. service partitioning in a grid environment [119,120]; 4. balanced partitioning in networks (e.g., modularization), balanced allocation of centers in networks [18,54]; 5. balanced partitioning of algorithms [139]; 6. balanced manufacturing scheduling in manufacturing systems (e.g., assembly line balancing problems) [6,9,35,36,61,62,64,80]; 7. design of balanced hierarchical structures in organizations [10,129]; 8. design and management in communication systems (network design, routing, etc.) based on balanced hierarchical structures [91,110]; and 9. design of distributed defence systems [74,150]. Evidently, balanced clustering problems (including combinatorial clustering, constrained clustering, etc.) are used as the basic balancing combinatorial models for all domains [19,34,104,105]. Some basic balanced clustering problems are pointed out in Table 1.\nIn general, the clustering problem is the following. Let A = {a1, ..., aj , ..., an} be the initial set of elements (items, objects). Usually, the following characteristics are examined:\n(1) parameters of each element aj \u2208 A as vector p(aj) = (p1(aj), ..., pi(aj), ..., pm(aj)); (2) structure(s) (binary relation(s)) over the elements set A: G = (A,E) where E is a set of edges/arcs\n(or weighted edges/arcs). A clustering solution consists of a set of clusters (e.g., without intersections) [104,105]:\nX\u0303 = {X1, ..., X\u03b9, ..., X\u03bb},\n3 i.e., dividing the set A into clusters: X\u03b9 \u2286 A \u2200\u03b9 = 1, \u03bb, \u03b7\u03b9 = |X\u03b9| is the cluster size (cardinality of cluster X\u03b9, \u03b9 \u2208 1, \u03bb ).\nThe basic balance (or unbalance/mismatch) index (parameter) for clustering solution is the difference between the maximal cardinality of a cluster and minimal cardinality of a cluster (in the considered clustering solution):\nBc(X\u0303) = max \u03b9=1,\u03bb \u03b7\u03b9 \u2212 min \u03b9=1,\u03bb \u03b7\u03b9.\nThus, the balanced clustering problem is targeted to search for the clustering solution with minimum balance index (e.g., index above). Clearly, additions to the balanced problem statement can involve the following: (a) some constraints: the fixed number of clusters, restriction(s) to cluster sizes (including specified integer interval), etc.; (b) objective function(s) (e.g., minimization of total interconnections weight between clusters, maximization of total element connections weight in clusters). This material contains an author preliminary outline of balanced clustering problems. The basic balanced structures are pointed out. New balance/unbalance indices for clustering solutions are suggested. Formulations of balanced optimization problems are described (including multicriteria problem formulations). Several numerical examples illustrate calculation of balance/unbalance indices for clustering solutions. A special example for design of student teams (as element multi-type cluster structure balanced clustering problem) is described. The material can be considered as a continuation of the author preprint on combinatorial clustering [104] and the corresponding article [105].\n4"}, {"heading": "2.

Combinatorial balancing problems", "text": "A list of basic balancing combinatorial optimization problems is presented in Table 2.\n7"}, {"heading": "4. Balance/unbalance indices for clustering solution", "text": "Here, balance/unbalance indices are described for clustering solution X\u0303 = {X1, ..., X\u03b9, ..., X\u03bb}. Let pbal(X\u03b9) be a total parameter for cluster X\u03b9 (\u03b9 = 1, \u03bb) (e.g, the number of elements, total weight). In general, a balance/unbalance index for clustering solution X\u0303 can be defined via two methods:\nMethod 1: The balance (unbalance) index is defined as the following:\nB(X\u0303) = max \u03b9=1,\u03bb pbal(X\u03b9)\u2212 min \u03b9=1,\u03bb pbal(X\u03b9).\nNote, assessment of pbal(X\u03b9) can be based on various scales: quantitative, ordinal, poset-like (e.g., multiset-based) [101,103]. Now, the following additional element parameters are considered: 1. The weight of item w(aj) \u2200aj \u2208 A (e.g., w(aj \u2265 0). 2. The weight of edge/arc between items v(aj1 , aj2) \u2200aj1 , aj2 \u2208 A, (aj1 , aj2) \u2208 E (e.g., v(aj1 , aj2) \u2265 0). 3. The structure of cluster by elements types is defined as a special multiset estimate [101,103]: e(X\u03b9), \u03b9 = 1, \u03bb, e(X\u03b9) = (\u03b81, ..., \u03b8\u03b3 , ..., \u03b8\u03b3), where \u03b8\u03b3 equals the number of element of type \u03b3 ( \u03b3 = 1, \u03b3 ) in cluster X\u03b9, the set of element types is: {1, ..., \u03b3, ..., \u03b3}, \u2211\u03b3 \u03b3=1 \u03b8\u03b3 = |X\u03b9|. In Fig. 4, an example with three element types is depicted (clustering solution X\u0303 = {X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7}). In addition, a special \u201cempty\u201d element type is considered with the number \u03b3 + 1. This is a basis to consider the clusters of the same size (cardinality) to compare their structure: for each cluster multiset estimate the following element is added: \u03b8\u03b3+1, for cluster of the maximal size \u03b8\u03b3+1 = 0, otherwise \u03b8\u03b3+1 = |X | max \u2212 |X\u03b9|, where |X |\nmax is the maximal cluster size. As a result, the number of components in each multiset estimate of cluster structure will be the same. The proximity between structure estimates for two clusters will be examined as a way (the number of steps) from one estimate to another estimate [101,103] (this is a simplified definition of the multiset estimate proximity). Note, the element types are linear ordered by importance/complexity (example for four types) 1 2 3 4. The ordering can be considered as a complexity of communication node, for example: access point (1), transition node (2), end-node (3), \u201cempty\u201d element (4). Thus, corresponding lattice based scale can be used [101,103]. As a result, the following balance indices for clustering solution can be examined (for method 1): (1.1) balance index by cluster cardinality is:\nBc(X\u0303) = max \u03b9=1,\u03bb |X\u03b9| \u2212 min \u03b9=1,\u03bb |X\u03b9|.\n(1.2) balance index by total cluster weight:\nBw(X\u0303) = max \u03b9=1,\u03bb\n\u2211\naj\u2208X\u03b9\nw(aj)\u2212 min \u03b9=1,\u03bb\n\u2211\naj\u2208X\u03b9\nw(aj).\n(1.3) balance index by total inter-cluster edge/arc weight:\nBv(X\u0303) = max \u03b9=1,\u03bb\n\u2211\naj1 ,aj2\u2208X\u03b9\nv(aj1 , aj2)\u2212 min \u03b9=1,\u03bb\n\u2211\naj1 ,aj2\u2208X\u03b9\nv(aj1 , aj2).\n(1.4) balance index by total cluster structure:\nBs(X\u0303) = max \u03b9=1,\u03bb e(X\u03b9)\u2212 min \u03b9=1,\u03bb e(X\u03b9).\nMethod 2. Here, the balance/unbalance index is defined as the following:\nB\u0302(X\u0303) = max \u03b9=1,\u03bb\n|pbal(X\u03b9)\u2212 p 0,\nwhere p0 is a special specified (e.g., average) parameter of a special reference (e.g., average) cluster X0 (size, weight, interconnection weight, structure estimate). Thus, the following balance indices for clustering solution can be examined:\n8 (2.1) balance index by cluster cardinality is:\nB\u0302c(X\u0303) = max \u03b9=1,\u03bb | |X\u03b9| \u2212 p|X0| |,\nwhere p|X0| is a special specified (e.g., average) cluster size. (2.2) balance index by total cluster weight:\nB\u0302w(X\u0303) = max \u03b9=1,\u03bb\n| \u2211\naj\u2208X\u03b9\nw(aj)\u2212 pw0 |,\nwhere pw0 is a special specified (e.g., average) cluster weight. (2.3) balance index by total inter-cluster edge/arc weight:\nB\u0302v(X\u0303) = max \u03b9=1,\u03bb\n| \u2211\naj1 ,aj2\u2208X\u03b9\nv(aj1 , aj2)\u2212 pv0 |,\nwhere pv0 is a special specified (e.g., average) cluster weight of inter-cluster interconnections (i.e., edges/arcs). (2.4) balance index by total cluster structure:\nB\u0302s(X\u0303) = max \u03b9=1,\u03bb | e(X\u03b9)\u2212 ep0 |,\nwhere ep0 is a special specified (e.g., average) multiset estimate of cluster structure.

Cluster structure based balanced clustering for student teams", "text": "The considered numerical example is a modification of an example from [104]. There is a set of 13 students A = {a1, ..., aj , ..., a13} (Table 13) in the field of radio engineering. Four inclination/skill properties of the students are considered as parameters/criteria (student estimates are shown in Table 13): (i) inclination (skill) for mathematics C1, (2) inclination (skill) for theoretical radio engineering C2, (3) skill for technical works in radio engineering (usage of radio devices, design of scheme, analysis of signals, etc.) C3, (4) writing skill (e.g., to prepare a laboratory work report/paper) C4. The following scale is used: [0, 1, 2, 3], where 0 corresponds to absent inclination/skill), 1 corresponds to low level of inclination/skill), 2 corresponds to medium level of inclination/skill), 3 corresponds to high level of inclination/skill). As a result, each student j (j = 1, 13) has a vector (4 component) estimate \u03be(aj) = (\u03be1(aj), \u03be 2(aj), \u03be 3(aj), \u03be\n4(aj)). It is assumed, each student has as minimum one \u201cpositive\u201d inclination/skill estimate (or more). A symmetric weighted binary relation of student friendship Rf = {\u03b5(aj1 , aj2)} (j1, j2 = 1, 13) (ordinal scale [0, 1, 2, 3], 0 corresponds to incompatibility) is contained in Table 14. Some notations are as follows. The structure of cluster is X\u03b9 = {b1, ..., b\u03c4 , ..., b\u00b5\u03b9}. Then the following cluster characteristics are examined: 1. The total vector estimate of the cluster structure is: \u03be(X\u03b9) = (\u03be 1(X\u03b9), \u03be 2(X\u03b9), \u03be 3(X\u03b9), \u03be 4(X\u03b9)),\n14\nwhere \u03be\u03ba(X\u03b9) = max\u03c4=1,\u00b5\u03b9 \u03be \u03ba(b\u03c4 ), \u2200\u03ba = 1, 4 (index of criteria/parameter). 2. The total estimate of the cluster by quality of intercluster compatibility is: \u03b5(X\u03b9) = \u2211 b\u03c41 ,b\u03c42\u2208X\u03b9,b\u03c41<b\u03c42 \u03b5(b\u03c41 , b\u03c42).\nFind the clustering solution X\u0303 = {X1, ..., X\u03b9, ..., X\u03bb}) (i.e., a set of student teams as clusters/groups without intersection) for implementation of special laboratory work(s) (e.g., in radio engineering) while taking into account some requirements:\n(a) constraints for the number of elements (students) in each cluster (i.e., cluster cardinality): \u03b7min \u2264 |X\u03b9|; (b) constraint for total inclination/skill in the cluster: \u03be(X\u03b9) \u03be0 = (2, 3, 3, 2); (c) the objective function 1 is to minimize the balance index by cluster cardinality Bc(X\u0303); (d) the objective function 2 is to maximize (multicriteria case) the worst cluster structure estimate; (e) the objective function 3 is to maximize the worst inter-cluster cluster estimate of element compat-\nibility.\nThe version of the optimization problem for the example above can be considered as follows:\nmin Bc(X\u0303) = max \u03b9=1,\u03bb |X\u03b9| \u2212 min \u03b9=1,\u03bb |X\u03b9|, max min \u03b9=1,\u03bb \u03be(X\u03b9), max min \u03b9=1,\u03bb \u03b5 (X\u03b9)\ns.t. 3 \u2264 |X\u03b9| \u2264 4 \u2200\u03b9 = 1, \u03bb, \u03be(X\u03b9) \u03be0 = (2, 2, 3, 2) \u2200\u03b9 = 1, \u03bb.\n15\nThe combinatorial optimization models of this kind are very complicated (i.e., NP-hard). Thus, enumerative algorithms or heuristics (metaheuristics) are used. Now, it is reasonable to describe a simplified heuristic (for the example above):\nStage 1. Counting an approximate number of clusters (e.g., 4). Stage 2. Selection of the most important criteria: 1st choice: criterion 3, 2nd choice: criterion 2. Stage 3. Selection of the best elements (about 4) from the viewpoints of the selected criteria (e.g., by Pareto-rule) as kernels (\u201cdomain(s) leaders\u201d) of the future clusters/teams. In general, small cliques or quasi-cliques can be considered as the kernels. In the example, the elements are: a1, a3, a6, a9. Stage 4. Extension of each kernel above by other elements while taking into account element compatibility. As a result, the following clustering solution can be considered: X\u0303 = {X1, X2, X3, X4} (B c(X\u0303) = 1), where the clusters are: (i) X1 = {a1, a2, a4}, \u03be(X1) = (2, 2, 3, 3), \u03b5(X1) = 8; (ii) X2 = {a3, a7, a8}, \u03be(X2) = (2, 3, 3, 2), \u03b5(X2) = 8; (iii) X3 = {a6, a5, a11}, \u03be(X3) = (3, 3, 3, 3), \u03b5(X3) = 8; (iv) X4 = {a9, a10, a12, a13}, \u03be(X4) = (3, 3, 3, 3), \u03b5(X4) = 15.\nNote, balance index by total inter-cluster edge weight is Bv(X\u0303) = 7.\nFig. 17 depicts the obtained four clusters solution X\u0303 = {X1, X2, X3, X4} (edge weight/compatibility estimates are pointed out)."}, {"heading": "7.
