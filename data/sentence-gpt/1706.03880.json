Introduction", "text": ""}, {"heading": "1.1. Overview of the problem.", "text": "Assortment optimization problems arise widely in many industries including retailing and online advertising where the seller needs to select a subset of items to offer from a universe of substitutable items such that the expected revenue is maximized. Choice models capture substitution effects among products by specifying the probability that a consumer selects a product given the offered set. Traditionally, the assortment decisions are made at the start of the selling period based on the estimated choice model from historical data; see Ko\u0308k and Fisher (2007) for a detailed review.\nIn this work, we focus on the dynamic version of the problem where the retailer needs to simultaneously learn consumer preferences and maximize revenue. In many business applications such as fast fashion and online retail, new products can be introduced or removed from the offered assortments in a fairly frictionless manner and the selling horizon for a particular product can be short. Therefore, the traditional approach of first estimating the choice model and then using a static assortment based on the estimates, is not practical in such settings. Rather, it is essential to experiment with different assortments to learn consumer preferences, while simultaneously attempting to maximize immediate revenues. Suitable balancing of this exploration-exploitation tradeoff is the focal point of this paper.\nWe consider a stylized dynamic optimization problem that captures some salient features of this application domain, where our goal is to develop an exploration-exploitation policy that simultaneously learns from current observations and exploits this information gain for future decisions. In particular, we consider a constrained assortment selection problem under the Multinomial logit (MNL) model with N substitutable products and a \u201cno purchase\u201d option. Our goal is to offer a sequence of assortments, S1, . . . , ST , where T is the planning horizon, such that the cumulative expected revenues over said horizon is maximized, or alternatively, minimizing the gap between the performance of a proposed policy and that of an oracle that knows instance parameters a priori, a quantity referred to as the regret.\nRelated literature. The Multinomial Logit model (MNL), owing primarily to its tractability, is the most widely used choice model for assortment selection problems. (The model was introduced independently by Luce (1959) and Plackett (1975), see also Train (2009), McFadden (1978), Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985) for further discussion and survey of other commonly used choice models.) If the consumer preferences (MNL parameters in our setting) are known a priori, then the problem of computing the optimal assortment, which we refer to as the static assortment optimization problem, is well studied. Talluri and van Ryzin (2004) consider the unconstrained assortment planning problem under the MNL model and present a greedy approach to obtain the optimal\nassortment. Recent works of Davis et al. (2013) and De\u0301sir and Goyal (2014) consider assortment\nplanning problems under MNL with various constraints. Other choice models such as Nested Logit\n(Williams (1977), Davis et al. (2011), Gallego and Topaloglu (2014) and Li et al. (2015)), Markov\nChain (Blanchet et al. (2016) and De\u0301sir et al. (2015)) and more general models (Farias et al. (2013)\nand Gallego et al. (2014)) are also considered in the literature.\nMost closely related to our work are the papers of Caro and Gallien (2007), Rusmevichientong\net al. (2010) and Saure\u0301 and Zeevi (2013), where information on consumer preferences is not known\nand needs to be learned over the course of the selling horizon. Caro and Gallien (2007) consider the\nsetting under which demand for products is independent of each other. Rusmevichientong et al.\n(2010) and Saure\u0301 and Zeevi (2013) consider the problem of minimizing regret under the MNL\nchoice model and present an \u201cexplore first and exploit later\u201d approach. In particular, a selected set\nof assortments are explored until parameters can be estimated to a desired accuracy and then the\noptimal assortment corresponding to the estimated parameters is offered for the remaining selling\nhorizon. The exploration period depends on certain a priori knowledge about instance parameters.\nAssuming that the optimal and next-best assortment are \u201cwell separated,\u201d they show an asymptotic\nO(N logT ) regret bound. However, their algorithm relies crucially on the a priori knowledge of\ncertain instance parameters which is not readily available in practice. Furthermore, their policies\nalso require a priori knowledge of the length of the planning horizon. In this work, we focus on\napproaches that simultaneously explore and exploit demand information and do not require any\nsuch a priori knowledge or assumptions; thereby, making our approach more universal in its scope.\nOur problem is closely related to the multi-armed bandit (MAB) paradigm. A naive mapping to\nthat setting would consider every assortment as an arm, and as such, would lead to exponentially\nmany arms. Popular extensions of MAB for large scale problems include the linear bandit (e.g., Auer\n(2003), Rusmevichientong and Tsitsiklis (2010)) and generalized linear bandit (Filippi et al. (2010))\nproblems. However, these do not apply directly to our problem, since the revenue corresponding\nto an assortment is nonlinear in problem parameters. Other works (see Chen et al. (2013)) have\nconsidered versions of MAB where one can play a subset of arms in each round and the expected\nreward is a function of rewards for the arms played. However, this approach assumes that the\nreward for each arm is generated independently of the other arms in the subset. This is not the case\ntypically in retail settings, and in particular, in the MNL choice model where purchase decisions\ndepend on the assortment of products offered in a time step. In this work, we use the structural\nproperties of the MNL model, along with techniques from MAB literature, to optimally explore\nand exploit in the presence of a large number of alternatives (assortments)."}, {"heading": "1.2. Contributions", "text": "Parameter independent online algorithm and regret bounds. We give an efficient online algorithm that judiciously balances the exploration and exploitation trade-off intrinsic to our problem and achieves a worst-case regret bound of O( \u221a NT logT ) under a mild assumption, namely that the no-purchase is the most \u201cfrequent\u201d outcome. Our algorithm is online in the sense that it does not require any prior knowledge of the instance parameters or the time horizon, T. Moreover, the regret bound we present for this algorithm is non-asymptotic and parameter independent. The \u201cbig-oh\u201d notation is used for brevity and only hides absolute constants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such policy to have a parameter independent regret bound for the MNL choice model. The assumption regarding no-purchase is quite natural and a norm in online retailing for example. Furthermore, we can establish a similar regret bound when this assumption is relaxed.\nWe also show that for \u201cwell separated\u201d instances, the regret of our policy is bounded by O ( min ( N 2 logT/\u2206, \u221a NT )) where \u2206 is the \u201cseparability\u201d parameter. This is comparable to the bounds established in Saure\u0301 and Zeevi (2013) and Rusmevichientong et al. (2010), even though we do not require any prior information on \u2206 unlike the aforementioned work. It is also interesting to note that the regret bounds hold true for a large class of constraints, e.g., we can handle matroid constraints such as assignment, partition and more general totally unimodular constraints (see Davis et al. (2013)). Our algorithm is predicated on upper confidence bound (UCB) type logic, originally developed to balance the aforementioned exploration-exploitation trade-off in the context of the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem (cf. Lai and Robbins (1985) and Auer et al. (2002)). In this paper the UCB approach, also known as optimism in the face of uncertainty, is customized to the assortment optimization problem under the MNL model.\nLower bounds. We establish a non-asymptotic lower bound for the online assortment optimization problem under the MNL model. In particular, we show that for the cardinality constrained problem\nunder the MNL model, any algorithm must incur a regret of \u2126( \u221a NT/K), where K is the bound on the number of products that can be offered in an assortment. This bound is derived via a reduction from a parametric multi-armed bandit problem, for which such lower bounds are constructed by means of information theoretic arguments. This result establishes that our online algorithm is nearly optimal, the upper bound being within a factor of \u221a K of the lower bound.\nComputational study. We present a computational study that highlights several salient features of our algorithm. In particular, we test the performance of our algorithm over instances with varying degrees of separability between optimal and sub-optimal solutions and observe that the performance is bounded irrespective of the \u201cseparability parameter\u201d. In contrast, the approach of Saure\u0301\nand Zeevi (2013) \u201cbreaks down\u201d and results in linear regret for some values of the \u201cseparability parameter.\u201d We also present results from a simulated study on a real world data set.\nOutline. In Section 2, we give the precise problem formulation. In Section 3, we present our algorithm for the MNL-Bandit problem, and in Section 4, we prove the worst-case regret bound of O\u0303( \u221a NT ) for our policy. We present the modified algorithm that works for a more general class of MNL parameters and establish O\u0303( \u221a BNT ) regret bounds in Section 5. In Section 6, we present the logarithmic regret bound for our policy for the case of \u201cwell separated\u201d instances. In Section 7, we present our non-asymptotic lower bound on regret for any algorithm for MNL-Bandit. In Section 8, we present results from our computational study."}, {"heading": "2. Problem formulation", "text": "The basic assortment problem. In our problem, at every time instance t, the seller selects an assortment St \u2282 {1, . . . ,N} and observes the customer purchase decision Ct \u2208 St \u222a {0}. As noted earlier, we assume consumer preferences are modeled using a multinomial logit (MNL) model. Under this model, the probability that a consumer purchases product i at time t when offered an assortment St = S \u2282 {1, . . . ,N} is given by,\npi(S) := P (Ct = i|St = S) =  vi v0 + \u2211 j\u2208S vj , if i\u2208 S \u222a{0}\n0, otherwise, (2.1)\nfor all t, where vi is the attraction parameter for product i in the MNL model. The random variables {Ct : t= 1,2, . . .} are conditionally independent, namely, Ct conditioned on the event {St = S} is independent of C1, . . . ,Ct\u22121. Without loss of generality, we can assume that v0 = 1. It is important to note that the parameters of the MNL model vi, are not known to the seller. From (2.1), the expected revenue when assortment S is offered and the MNL parameters are denoted by the vector v is given by\nR(S,v) =E [\u2211 i\u2208S ri1{Ct = i|St = S} ] = \u2211 i\u2208S rivi 1 + \u2211 j\u2208S vj . (2.2)\nWe consider several naturally arising constraints over the assortments that the retailer can offer. These include cardinality constraints (where there is an upper bound on the number of products that can be offered in the assortment), partition matroid constraints (where the products are partitioned into segments and the retailer can select at most a specified number of products from each segment) and joint display and assortment constraints (where the retailer needs to decide both the assortment as well as the display segment of each product in the assortment and there is an upper bound on the number of products in each display segment). More generally, we consider the set of totally unimodular (TU) constraints on the assortments. Let x(S)\u2208 {0,1}N be the incidence\nvector for assortment S \u2286 {1, . . . ,N}, i.e., xi(S) = 1 if product i\u2208 S and 0 otherwise. We consider constraints of the form\nS = {S \u2286 {1, . . . ,N} |A x(S)\u2264 b, 0\u2264 x\u2264 1} , (2.3)\nwhere A is a totally unimodular matrix. The totally unimodular constraints model a rich class of practical assortment planning problems including the examples discussed above. We refer the reader to Davis et al. (2013) for a detailed discussion on assortment and pricing optimization problems that can be formulated under the TU constraints.\nAdmissible Policies. To define the set of policies that can be used by the seller, let U be a random variable, which encodes any additional sources of randomization and (U,U ,Pu) be the corresponding probability space. We define {\u03c0t, t= 1,2, . . .} to be a measurable mapping as follows:\n\u03c01 :U\u2192S\n\u03c0t :U\u00d7St\u22121\u00d7{0, . . . ,N}t\u22121\u2192S, for each t= 2,3, . . . where S is as defined in (2.3). Then the assortment selection for the seller at time t is given by\nSt =\n{ \u03c01(U), t= 1\n\u03c0t(U,C1, . . . ,Ct\u22121, S1, . . . , St\u22121), t= 2,3, . . . , (2.4)\nFor further reference, let {Ht : t = 1,2, . . .} denote the filtration associated with the policy \u03c0 = (\u03c01, \u03c02, . . . , \u03c0t, . . .). Specifically,\nH1 = \u03c3(U)\nHt = \u03c3(U,C1, . . . ,Ct\u22121, S1, . . . , St\u22121), for each t= 2,3, . . . . We denote by P\u03c0{.} and E\u03c0{.} the probability distribution and expectation value over path space induced by the policy \u03c0.\nThe online assortment optimization problem. The objective is to design a policy \u03c0 = (\u03c01, . . . , \u03c0T ) that selects a sequence of history dependent assortments (S1, S2, . . . , ST ) so as to maximize the cumulative expected revenue,\nE\u03c0 ( T\u2211 t=1 R(St,v) ) , (2.5)\nwhere R(S,v) is defined as in (2.2). Direct analysis of (2.5) is not tractable given that the parameters {vi, i = 1, . . . ,N} are not known to the seller a priori. Instead we propose to measure the performance of a policy \u03c0 via its regret. The objective then is to design a policy that approximately minimizes the regret defined as\nReg\u03c0(T,v) = T\u2211 t=1 R(S\u2217,v)\u2212E\u03c0[R(St,v)], (2.6)\nwhere S\u2217 is the optimal assortment for (2.2), namely, S\u2217 = argmax S\u2208S R(S,v). This explorationexploitation problem, which we refer to as MNL-Bandit, is the focus of this paper."}, {"heading": "3. The proposed policy", "text": "In this section, we describe our proposed policy for the MNL-Bandit problem. The policy is designed using the characteristics of the MNL model based on the principle of optimism under uncertainty."}, {"heading": "3.1. Challenges and overview", "text": "A key difficulty in applying standard multi-armed bandit techniques to this problem is that the response observed on offering a product i is not independent of other products in assortment S. Therefore, the N products cannot be directly treated as N independent arms. As mentioned before, a naive extension of MAB algorithms for this problem would treat each of the feasible assortments as an arm, leading to a computationally inefficient algorithm with exponential regret. Our policy utilizes the specific properties of the dependence structure in MNL model to obtain an efficient algorithm with order \u221a NT regret.\nOur policy is based on a non-trivial extension of the UCB algorithm Auer et al. (2002). It uses the past observations to maintain increasingly accurate upper confidence bounds for the MNL parameters {vi, i = 1, . . . ,N}, and uses these to (implicitly) maintain an estimate of expected revenue R(S) for every feasible assortment S. In every round, our policy picks the assortment S with the highest optimistic revenue. There are two main challenges in implementing this scheme. First, the customer response to being offered an assortment S depends on the entire set S, and does not directly provide an unbiased sample of demand for a product i\u2208 S. In order to obtain unbiased estimates of vi for all i \u2208 S, we offer a set S multiple times: specifically, it is offered repeatedly until a no-purchase occurs. We show that proceeding in this manner, the average number of times a product i is purchased provides an unbiased estimate of the parameter vi. The second difficulty is the computational complexity of maintaining and optimizing revenue estimates for each of the exponentially many assortments. To this end, we use the structure of the MNL model and define our revenue estimates such that the assortment with maximum estimated revenue can be efficiently found by solving a simple optimization problem. This optimization problem turns out to be a static assortment optimization problem with upper confidence bounds for vi\u2019s as the MNL parameters, for which efficient solution methods are available."}, {"heading": "3.2. Details of the policy", "text": "We divide the time horizon into epochs, where in each epoch we offer an assortment repeatedly until a no purchase outcome occurs. Specifically, in each epoch `, we offer an assortment S` repeatedly. Let E` denote the set of consecutive time steps in epoch `. E` contains all time steps after the end of epoch `\u2212 1, until a no-purchase happens in response to offering S`, including the time step at which no-purchase happens.

We would like to note that the first assumption is made for ease in presenting the key results and is not central to deriving bounds on the regret. In section 5, we relax this assumption and derive regret bounds that hold for any parameter instance.\nOur main result is the following upper bound on the regret of the policy stated in Algorithm 1.\nTheorem 1 For any instance v = (v0, . . . , vN) of the MNL-Bandit problem with N products, ri \u2208 [0,1] under Assumption 4.1, the regret of the policy given by Algorithm 1 at time T is bounded as,\nReg\u03c0(T,v)\u2264C1 \u221a NT logT +C2N log 2 T,\nwhere C1 and C2 are absolute constants (independent of problem parameters)."}, {"heading": "4.1. Proof Outline", "text": "In this section, we provide an outline of different steps involved in proving Theorem 1.\nConfidence intervals. The first step in our regret analysis is to prove the following two properties of the estimates vUCBi,` computed as in (3.4) for each product i. Specifically, that vi is bounded by vUCBi,` with high probability, and that as a product is offered more and more times, the estimates vUCBi,` converge to the true value with high probability. Intuitively, these properties establish v UCB i,` as upper confidence bounds converging to actual parameters vi, akin to the upper confidence bounds used in the UCB algorithm for MAB in Auer et al. (2002). We provide the precise statements for the above mentioned properties in Lemma 4.1. These properties follow from an observation that is conceptually equivalent to the IIA (Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives) property of MNL. This observation shows that in each epoch \u03c4 , v\u0302i,\u03c4 (the number of purchases of product i) provides an independent unbiased estimates of vi. Intuitively, v\u0302i,\u03c4 is the ratio of probabilities of purchasing product i to preferring product 0 (no-purchase), which is independent of S\u03c4 . This also explains why we choose to offer S\u03c4 repeatedly until no-purchase occurs. Given these unbiased i.i.d. estimates from every epoch \u03c4 before `, we apply a multiplicative Chernoff-Hoeffding bound to prove concentration of v\u0304i,`.\nCorrectness of the optimistic assortment. The product demand estimates vUCBi,`\u22121 were used in (3.7) to define expected revenue estimates R\u0303`(S) for every set S. In the beginning of every epoch `, Algorithm 1 computes the optimistic assortment as S` = arg maxS R\u0303`(S), and then offers S` repeatedly until no-purchase happens. The next step in the regret analysis is to use above properties of vUCBi,` to prove similar, though slightly weaker, properties for the estimates R\u0303`(S). First, we show that estimated revenue is an upper confidence bound on the optimal revenue, i.e. R(S\u2217,v) is\nbounded by R\u0303`(S`) with high probability. The proof for these properties involves careful use of the structure of MNL model to show that the value of R\u0303`(S`) is equal to the highest expected revenue achievable by any feasible assortment, among all instances of the problem with parameters in the range [0, vUCBi ], i= 1, . . . , n. Since the actual parameters lie in this range with high probability, we have R\u0303`(S`) is at least R(S \u2217,v) with high probability. Lemma 4.2 provides the precise statement.\nBounding the regret. The final part of our analysis is to bound the regret in each epoch. First, we use the above property to bound the loss due to offering the optimistic assortment S`. In particular, we show that the loss is bounded by the difference between optimistic estimated revenue, R\u0303`(S`), and actual expected revenue, R(S`). We then prove a Lipschitz property of the expected revenue function to bound the difference between optimistic estimate and expected revenues in terms of errors in individual product estimates |vUCBi,` \u2212 vi|. Finally, we leverage the structure of MNL model and the properties of vUCBi,` to bound the regret in each epoch.

Intuitvely, after any call to AMNL (\u201cCall AMNL \u201d in Algorithm 3), many iterations of the following loop may be executed; in roughly 1/2 of those iterations, an arm is pulled and t is advanced (with probability 1/2, the loop is exited without advancing t). Therefore, T should be at least a constant fraction of L. Lemma E.3 in Appendix makes this intuition precise by showing that E(L)\u2264 3T .\nNow we are ready to prove Theorem 4. From (7.1) and (7.2), we have RegAMAB (T,\u00b5)\u2264E ( RegAMNL (L,v) + v\u2217L\n(1 +\u03b1)2\n) .\nFor the sake of contradiction, suppose that the regret of the AMNL , RegAMNL (L,v)\u2264 c \u221a N\u0302L K for a constant c to be prescribed below. Then, from Jensen\u2019s inequality, it follows that,\nRegAMAB (T,\u00b5) \u2264 c \u221a N\u0302E(L) K + v\u2217E(L) (1 +\u03b1)2\nFrom lemma E.3, we have that E(L)\u2264 3T . Therefore, we have, c \u221a\nN\u0302E(L) K\n= c \u221a NE(L)\u2264 c \u221a 3NT =\nc T \u221a\n3 \u03b1 < T 12 on setting c < 1 12 \u221a \u03b1 3 . Also, using v\u2217 = \u03b1+ \u2264 2\u03b1, and setting \u03b1 to be a small enough\nconstant, we can get that the second term above is also strictly less than T 12 . Combining these observations, we have RegAMAB (T,\u00b5)< T 12 + T 12 = T 6 , thus arriving at a contradiction."}, {"heading": "8.

It can be observed that regret is roughly logarithmic when = 0.25, and in contrast roughly behaves like \u221a T when\n= 0.05. This illustrates the theory developed in Section 6, where we showed that the regret grows logarithmically with time, if the optimal assortment and next best assortment are \u201cwell separated\u201d, while the worst-case regret scales as \u221a T ."}, {"heading": "8.2. Comparison with existing approaches.", "text": "In this section, we present a computational study comparing the performance of our algorithm to that of Saure\u0301 and Zeevi (2013). (To the best of our knowledge, Saure\u0301 and Zeevi (2013) is currently the best existing approach for our problem setting.) To be implemented, their approach requires certain a priori information of a \u201cseparability parameter\u201d; roughly speaking, measuring the degree to which the optimal and next-best assortments are distinct from a revenue standpoint. More specifically, their algorithm follows an explore-then-exploit approach, where every product is first required to be offered for a minimum duration of time that is determined by an estimate of said \u201cseparability parameter.\u201d After this mandatory exploration phase, the parameters of the choice model are estimated based on the past observations and the optimal assortment corresponding to the estimated parameters is offered for the subsequent consumers. If the optimal assortment and the next best assortment are \u201cwell separated,\u201d then the offered assortment is optimal with high probability, otherwise, the algorithm could potentially incur linear regret. Therefore, the knowledge of this \u201cseparability parameter\u201d is crucial. For our comparison, we consider the exploration period suggested by Saure\u0301 and Zeevi (2013) and compare it with the performance of Algorithm 1 for different values of separation ( .) We will show that for any given exploration period, there is an instance where the approach in Saure\u0301 and Zeevi (2013) \u201cbreaks down\u201d or in other words incurs\nlinear regret, while the regret of Algorithm 1 grows sub-linearly (as O( \u221a T ), more precisely) for all values of as asserted in Theorem 1.\nExperimental setup and results. We consider the parametric MNL setting as described in (8.1) and for each value of \u2208 {0.05,0.1,0.15,0.25}. Since the implementation of the policy in Saure\u0301 and Zeevi (2013) requires knowledge of the selling horizon and minimum exploration period a priori, we consider the exploration period to be 20 logT as suggested in Saure\u0301 and Zeevi (2013) and the selling horizon as T = 106. Figure 3 compares the regret of Algorithm 1 with that of Saure\u0301 and Zeevi (2013). The results are based on running 100 independent simulations with standard error of 2%. We observe that the regret of the Saure\u0301 and Zeevi (2013) is better than the regret of Algorithm 1 when = 0.25 but is worse for other values of . This can be attributed to the fact that for the assumed exploration period, Their algorithm fails to identify the optimal assortment within the exploration phase with sufficient probability and hence incurs a linear regret for = 0.05,0.1 and 0.15. Specifically, among the 100 simulations we tested, the algorithm of Saure\u0301 and Zeevi (2013) identified the optimal assortment for only 7%,40%,61% and 97% cases, when = 0.05,0.1,0.15, and 0.25 respectively. This highlights the sensitivity to the \u201cseparability parameter\u201d and the importance of having a reasonable estimate on the exploration period. Needless to say, such information is typically not available in practice. In contrast, the performance of Algorithm 1 is consistent across different values of , insofar as the regret grows in a sub-linear fashion in all cases."}, {"heading": "8.3. Performance of Algorithm 1 on real data.", "text": "Here, we present the results of a simulated study of Algorithm 1 on a real data set.\nData description. We consider the \u201cUCI Car Evaluation Database\u201d (see Lichman (2013)) which contains attributes based information of N = 1728 cars and consumer ratings for each car. The exact details of the attributes are provided in Table 1. Rating for each car is also available. In particular, every car is associated with one of the following four ratings, unacceptable, acceptable, good and very good.\nAssortment optimization framework. We assume that the consumer choice is modeled by\nthe MNL model, where the mean utility of a product is linear in the values of attributes. More\nspecifically, we convert the categorical attributes described in Table 1 to attributes with binary\nvalues by adding dummy attributes (for e.g. \u201cprice very high\u201d, \u201cprice low\u201d are considered as two\ndifferent attributes that can take values 1 or 0). Now every car is associated with an attribute vector mi \u2208 {0,1}22, which is known a priori and the mean utility of product i is given by the inner product\n\u00b5i = \u03b8 \u00b7mi i= 1, . . . ,N,\nwhere \u03b8 \u2208R22 is some fixed, but initially unknown attribute weight vector.

We first estimate a ground truth MNL model as follows. Using the available attribute level data and consumer rating for each car, we estimate a logistic model assuming every car\u2019s rating is independent of the ratings of other cars to estimate the attribute weight vector \u03b8. Specifically, under the logistic model, the probability that a consumer will purchase a car whose attributes are defined by the vector m \u2208 {0,1}22 and the attribute weight vector \u03b8 is given by\npbuy(\u03b8,m) \u2206 = P (buy|\u03b8) = e\n\u03b8\u00b7m\n1 + e\u03b8\u00b7m .\nFor the purpose of training the logistic model on the available data, we consider the consumer ratings of \u201cacceptable,\u201d \u201cgood,\u201d and \u201cvery good\u201d as success or intention to buy and the consumer rating of \u201cunacceptable\u201d as a failure or no intention to buy. We then use the maximum likelihood estimate \u03b8MLE for \u03b8 to run simulations and study the performance of Algorithm 1 for the realized \u03b8MLE. In particular, we compute \u03b8MLE that maximizes the following regularized log-likelihood\n\u03b8MLE = argmax \u03b8 N\u2211 i=1 log pbuy(\u03b8,mi)\u2212\u2016\u03b8\u20162.\nThe objective function in the preceding optimization problem is convex and therefore we can use any of the standard convex optimization techniques to obtain the estimate, \u03b8MLE. It is important to note that the logistic model is only employed to obtain an estimate for \u03b8, \u03b8MLE. The estimate \u03b8MLE is assumed to be the ground truth MNL model and is used to simulate the feedback of consumer choices for our learning Algorithm 1. We measure the performance of Algorithm 1 in terms of regret as defined in (8.3) with \u03b8= \u03b8MLE.\nFigure 4 plots the regret of Algorithm 1 on the \u201cUCI Car Evaluation Database\u201d, when the selling horizon is T = 107 and at each time index, retailer cann show at most k = 100 cars. The results are based on running 100 independent simulations and have a standard error of 2%. The regret of Algorithm 1, is seen to grow in a sublinear fashion with respect to the selling horizon. It should be noted that Algorithm 1 did not require any a priori knowledge on the parameters unlike the other existing approaches such as Saure\u0301 and Zeevi (2013) and therefore can be applied to a wide range of other settings."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "V.

In Section A.1, we complete the proof of Lemma 4.1 and in Section A.2, we prove similar properties for estimates R\u0303`(S`). Finally, in Section A.3, we utilize these properties to complete the proof of Theorem 1 .\nA.1. Properties of estimates vUCBi,`\nFirst, we focus on properties of the estimates v\u0302i,` and v\u0304i,`, and then extend these properties to establish the necessary properties of vUCBi,` .\nUnbiased Estimates.\nLemma A.1 The moment generating function of estimate conditioned on S`, v\u0302i, is given by,\nE\u03c0 ( e\u03b8v\u0302i,` \u2223\u2223\u2223S`)= 1 1\u2212 vi(e\u03b8\u2212 1) , for all \u03b8\u2264 log 1 + vi vi , for all i= 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,N.\nProof. From (2.1), we have that probability of no purchase event when assortment S` is offered\nis given by\np0(S`) = 1 1 + \u2211\nj\u2208S` vj .\nLet n` be the total number of offerings in epoch ` before a no purchased occurred, i.e., n` = |E`|\u22121. Therefore, n` is a geometric random variable with probability of success p0(S`). And, given any fixed value of n`, v\u0302i,` is a binomial random variable with n` trials and probability of success given by\nqi(S`) = vi\u2211 j\u2208S` vj .\nIn the calculations below, for brevity we use p0 and qi respectively to denote p0(S`) and qi(S`). Hence, we have\nE\u03c0 ( e\u03b8v\u0302i,` ) =En` { E\u03c0 ( e\u03b8v\u0302i,` \u2223\u2223n`)} .\nSince the moment generating function for a binomial random variable with parameters n,p is (pe\u03b8 + 1\u2212 p)n, we have\nE\u03c0 ( e\u03b8v\u0302i,` \u2223\u2223n`)=En` {(qie\u03b8 + 1\u2212 qi)n`} . For any \u03b1, such that, \u03b1(1\u2212 p)< 1 n is a geometric random variable with parameter p, we have\nE\u03c0(\u03b1n) = p\n1\u2212\u03b1(1\u2212 p) .\nNote that for all \u03b8 < log 1+vi vi , we have (qie \u03b8 + (1\u2212 qi)) (1 \u2212 p0) = (1 \u2212 p0) + p0vi(e\u03b8 \u2212 1) < 1.

However, these estimates are geometric random variables and therefore\nhave extremely small tails. Hence, we can extend the Chernoff-Hoeffding bounds discussed in Mitzenmacher and Upfal (2005) and Babaioff et al. (2015) to geometric variables and prove the above result. Lemma 4.1 follows directly from Lemma A.2. The proof of Lemma A.2 is long and tedious and in the interest of continuity, we complete the proof in Appendix D. Following the proof of Lemma A.2, we obtain a very similar result that is useful to establish concentration bounds for the general parameter setting.\nLemma 4.1 follows from Corollary A.1 and Lemma A.2 and establishes the necessary properties\nof vUCBi.` and v UCB2 i.` as alluded in the proof outline.\nA.2. Properties of estimate R\u0303(S)\nIn this section, we show that the estimates R\u0303`(S`) are upper confidence bounds converging \u201cquickly\u201d to the expected revenue corresponding to the optimal assortment, R(S\u2217,v).\nOptimistic Estimates. First, we establish that R\u0303`(S) is an upper bound estimate of the optimal revenue,R(S\u2217,v). LetR(S,w) be as defined in (2.2), namely, the expected revenue when assortment S is offered and if the parameters of the MNL were given by the vector w. Then, from definition of R\u0303`(S) (refer to (3.7)), it follows that R\u0303`(S) =R(S,v UCB ` ).\nLemma A.3 Assume 0\u2264wi \u2264 vUCBi for all i= 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n. Suppose S is an optimal assortment when the MNL are parameters are given by w. Then, R(S,vUCB)\u2265R(S,w).\nProof. We prove the result by first showing that for any j \u2208 S, we have R(S,wj) \u2265 R(S,w), where wj is vector w with the jth component increased to vUCBj , i.e. w j i = wi for all i 6= j and wjj = v UCB j . We can use this result iteratively to argue that increasing each parameter of MNL to the highest possible value increases the value of R(S,w) to complete the proof.\nIt is easy to see that if rj < R(S) removing the product j from assortment S yields higher\nexpected revenue contradicting the optimality of S. Therefore, we have\nrj \u2265R(S).\nMultiplying by (vUCBj \u2212wj)( \u2211 i\u2208S/j wi + 1) on both sides of the above inequality and re-arranging terms, we can show that R(S,wj)\u2265R(S,w).\nLet S\u0302,w\u2217 be maximizers of the optimization problem, max S\u2208S\nmax 0\u2264wi\u2264vUCBi,` R(S,w). Then applying\nlemma A.3 on assortment S\u0302 and parameters v\u2217 and noting that vUCBi,` > vi with high probability, we have that\nR\u0303`(S`) = max S\u2208S R(S,vUCB` )\u2265max S\u2208S max 0\u2264wi\u2264vUCBi,` R(S,w)\u2265R(S\u2217,v).\nBounding Regret. Now we will establish the connection between the error on the expected revenues and the error on the estimates of MNL parameters. In particular, we have the following result.\nLemma A.4 If 0\u2264 vi \u2264 vUCBi,` for all i\u2208 S`, then R\u0303`(S`)\u2212R(S`,v)\u2264 \u2211 j\u2208S` ( vUCBj,` \u2212 vj ) 1+ \u2211\nj\u2208S` vj\n.\nProof. Since 1 + \u2211\ni\u2208S` vUCBi,` \u2265 1 + \u2211 i\u2208S` vi,`, we have\nR\u0303`(S`)\u2212R(S`,v)\u2264 \u2211 i\u2208S` riv UCB i,` 1+ \u2211\nj\u2208S` vUCBj,`\n\u2212 \u2211 i\u2208S` rivi\n1+ \u2211\nj\u2208S` vUCBj,`\n,\n\u2264 \u2211 i\u2208S` ( vUCBi,` \u2212 vi ) 1 + \u2211 j\u2208S` vUCBj,` \u2264 \u2211 i\u2208S` ( vUCBi,` \u2212 vi ) 1 + \u2211 j\u2208S` vj\nLemma 4.3 follows directly from the above result and Lemma 4.1, while Lemma 4.3 follows\ndirectly from the above result and Lemma 4.1.\nA.3. Putting it all together: Proof of Theorem 1\nIn this section, we formalize the intuition developed in the previous sections and complete the proof of Theorem 1.\nLet S\u2217 denote the optimal assortment, our objective is to minimize the regret defined in (2.6),\nwhich is same as\nReg\u03c0(T,v) =E\u03c0 { L\u2211 `=1 |E`| (R(S\u2217,v)\u2212R(S`,v)) } , (A.1)\nNote that L, E` and S` are all random variables and the expectation in equation (A.1) is over these random variables. Let H` be the filtration (history) associated with the policy upto epoch `. In particular,\nH` = \u03c3(U,C1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Ct(`), S1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , St(`)),\nwhere t(`) is the time index corresponding to the end of epoch `. The length of the `th epoch, |E`| conditioned on S` is a geometric random variable with success probability defined as the probability of no-purchase in S`, i.e.\np0(S`) = 1 1 + \u2211\nj\u2208S` vj .\nLet V (S`) = \u2211\nj\u2208S` vj, then we have E\u03c0\n( |E`| \u2223\u2223\u2223 S`)= 1+V (S`). Noting that S` in our policy is determined by H`\u22121, we have E\u03c0 ( |E`| \u2223\u2223\u2223H`\u22121)= 1+V (S`). Therefore, by law of conditional expectations, we have\nReg\u03c0(T,v) =E\u03c0 { L\u2211 `=1 E\u03c0 [ |E`| (R(S\u2217,v)\u2212R(S`,v)) \u2223\u2223\u2223H`\u22121]} ,\nand hence the regret can be reformulated as\nReg\u03c0(T,v) =E\u03c0 { L\u2211 `=1 (1 +V (S`)) (R(S \u2217,v)\u2212R(S`,v)) } (A.2)\nthe expectation in equation (A.2) is over the random variables L and S`. We now provide the proof sketch for Theorem 1 and the complete proof is provided in the full version of the paper. Proof of Theorem 1.

Specifically, we first prove that the initial exploratory phase is indeed bounded and then follow the proof of Theorem 1 to establish the correctness of confidence intervals, optimistic assortment and finally deriving the convergence rates and regret bounds.\nBounding Exploratory Epochs. We would denote an epoch ` as an \u201cexploratory epoch\u201d if the assortment offered in the epoch contains a product that has been offered in less than 48 log (`+ 1) epochs. It is easy to see that the number of exploratory epochs is bounded by 48N logT , where T is the selling horizon under consideration. We then use the observation that the length of any epoch is a geometric random variable to bound the total expected duration of the exploration phase. Hence, we bound the expected regret due to explorations.\nLemma B.1 Let L be the total number of epochs in Algorithm 2 and let EL denote the set of \u201cexploratory epochs\u201d, i.e.\nEL = {` | \u2203 i\u2208 S` such that Ti(`)< 48 log (`+ 1)} ,\nwhere Ti(`) is the number of epochs product i has been offered before epoch `.

Consider an `\u2208EL, note that |E`| is a geometric random variable with parameter 1V (S`)+1 .

Therefore, we have the conditional\nexpectation of |E`| given that assortment S` is offered is bounded as,\nE\u03c0 (|E`| | S`)\u2264B|S`|+ 1.\nNote that after every product has been offered in at least 48 logT epochs, then we do not have any exploratory epochs.

In particular, since 1\u2212 \u03b4\u2264 1, we have for any x> 0 it follows that (1 + x 1\u2212\u03b4 ) (1\u2212\u03b4) \u2264 (1 +x) . Therefore, we have\nPr\n( 1\nn n\u2211 i=1 Xi < (1\u2212 \u03b4)\u00b5\n) \u2264 ( 1 + \u03b4\n1 +\u00b5\n)n\u00b5( 1\u2212 \u03b4\u00b5\n1 +\u00b5\n)n . (D.6)\nCase 2a.

Therefore, we assume \u03b4 < 1 and from Taylor series for log (1\u2212x), we have\nn log ( 1\u2212 \u03b4\u00b5\n1 +\u00b5\n) \u2264\u2212 n\u03b4\u00b5\n1 +\u00b5 ,\nand from Taylor series for log (1 +x), we have\nn\u00b5 log ( 1 + \u03b4\n1 +\u00b5\n) \u2264 n\u03b4\u00b5\n(1 +\u00b5) \u2212 n\u03b4\n2\u00b5\n6(1 +\u00b5)2\n( 3\u2212 2\u03b4\u00b5\n1 +\u00b5\n) .\nTherefore, substituting the preceding equations in (D.6), we have,\nPr\n( 1\nn n\u2211 i=1 Xi < (1\u2212 \u03b4)\u00b5\n) \u2264 exp ( \u2212 n\u03b4 2\u00b5\n6(1 +\u00b5)2\n( 3\u2212 2\u03b4\u00b5\n1 +\u00b5\n)) . (D.7)\nCase 2b.

Let P1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Pn denote the distributions for the view of the algorithm from time 1 to T , when the biased coin is hidden in the ith position. The following result establishes for any guessing algorithm, there are at least N 3 positions that a biased coin could be and will not be played by the guessing algorithm with probability at least 1 2 . Specifically,\nLemma E.2 Let A be any guessing algorithm operating as specified above and let t \u2264 N\u03b1 60 2 , for\n\u2264 1 4 and N \u2265 12. Then, there exists J \u2282 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,N} with |J | \u2265 N 3 such that\n\u2200j \u2208 J, Pj(at = j)\u2264 1\n2\nLet Ni to be the number of times the algorithm plays coin i up to time t. Let P0 be the\nhypothetical distribution for the view of the algorithm when none of the N coins are biased. We shall define the set J by considering the behavior of the algorithm if tosses it saw were according to the distribution P0. We define,\nJ1 =\n{ i \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223EP0(Ni)\u2264 3tN } , J2 = { i \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223P0(at = i)\u2264 3N } and J = J1 \u2229J2. (E.1)\nSince \u2211 iEP0(Ni) = t and \u2211 iP0(at = i) = 1, a counting argument would give us |J1| \u2265 2N\n3 and\n|J2| \u2265 2n 3 and hence |J | \u2265 N 3 . Consider any j \u2208 J , we will now prove that if the biased coin is at position j, then the probability of algorithm guessing the biased coin will not be significantly different from the P0 scenario. By Pinsker\u2019s inequality, we have\n|Pj(at = j)\u2212P0(at = j)| \u2264 1\n2\n\u221a 2 log 2 \u00b7KL(P0\u2016Pj), (E.2)\nwhere KL(P0\u2016Pj) is the KL divergence of probability distributions P0 and Pj over the algorithm. Using the chain rule for KL-divergence, we have\nKL(P0\u2016Pj) =EP0(Nj)KL(p||q),\nwhere p is a Bernoulli distribution with parameter \u03b1 and q is a Bernoulli distribution with param-\neter \u03b1+ . From Lemma E.1 and (E.1), we have that Therefore,\nKL(P0\u2016Pj)\u2264 4 2\n\u03b1 ,\nTherefore,\nPj(at = j)\u2264P0(at = j) + 1\n2\n\u221a 2 log 2 \u00b7KL(P0\u2016Pj)\n\u2264 3 N + 1 2\n\u221a (2 log 2) 4 2\n\u03b1 EP0(Nj)\n\u2264 3 N\n+ \u221a 2 log 2\n\u221a 3t 2\nN\u03b1 \u2264 1 2 .\n(E.3)\nThe second inequality follows from (E.1), while the last inequality follows from the fact that N > 12 and t\u2264 N\u03b1 60 2 Q.E.D..\nProof of Lemma 7.1 . Let = \u221a\nN 60\u03b1T . Suppose algorithm A plays coin at at time t for each\nt= 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , T . Since T \u2264 N\u03b1 60 2 , for all t\u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , T \u22121} there exists a set Jt \u2282 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,N} with |Jt| \u2265 N3 such that\n\u2200 j \u2208 Jt, Pj(j \u2208 St)\u2264 1\n2\nLet i\u2217 denote the position of the biased coin.

Therefore, we have\n\u00b5at \u2264 1 3 \u00b7 ( \u03b1+ 2 ) + 2 3 \u00b7 (\u03b1+ ) = \u03b1+ 5 6\nWe have \u00b5\u2217 = \u03b1+ and hence the Regret\u2265 T 6 .\nLemma E.3 Let L be the total number of calls to AMNL when AMAB is executed for T time steps. Then,\nE(L)\u2264 3T.\nProof. Let \u03b7` be the random variable that denote the duration, assortment S` has been considered by AMAB, i.e. \u03b7` = 0, if we no arm is pulled when AMNL suggested assortment S` and \u03b7` \u2265 1, otherwise. We have L\u22121\u2211 `=1 \u03b7` \u2264 T.\nTherefore, we have E (\u2211L\u22121\n`=1 \u03b7` ) \u2264 T . Note that E(\u03b7`) \u2265 12 . Hence, we have E(L) \u2264 2T + 1 \u2264 3T."}], "references": [{"title": "Fast probabilistic algorithms for hamiltonian circuits and matchings", "author": ["D. Angluin", "L.G.
