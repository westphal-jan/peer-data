However, many of the corpora used in these studies are based on naturalistic text and thus do not contain many of the low-frequency syntactic constructions that are often required to distinguish processing theories. Here we describe a new corpus consisting of English texts edited to contain many low-frequency syntactic constructions while still sounding fluent to native speakers. The analysis of the corpus contains many small errors and some high-frequency syntactic constructs. Here, we report that these errors are usually not used as a rule of thumb, since they have been reported with low accuracy. These errors were identified by several authors and will not necessarily be reported as the best predictor of accuracy for accuracy, since the errors are often observed in a single source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 21:27:34 GMT  (393kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05763v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["richard futrell", "edward gibson", "hal tily", "idan blank", "anastasia vishnevetsky", "steven t piantadosi", "evelina fedorenko"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.05763"}, "pdf": {"name": "1708.05763.pdf", "metadata": {"source": "CRF", "title": "The Natural Stories Corpus", "authors": ["Richard Futrell", "Edward Gibson", "Hal Tily", "Idan Blank", "Anastasia Vishnevetsky", "Steven T.

While this approach makes it easy to compare models on their accuracy for specific constructions and phenomena, it is hard to get a sense from experimental results of how models compare on their coverage of a broad range of phenomena. When it is standard practice to compare model predictions over standardized texts, then it is easier to evaluate coverage.\nAlthough the fixed corpus approach has these advantages, the existing corpora currently used are based on naturally-occurring data, which is unlikely to include the kinds of sentences which can crucially distinguish between theories. Many of the most puzzling phenomena in psycholinguistics, and the phenomena which have been used to test models, have only been observed in extremely rare constructions, such as multiply nested preverbal relative clauses (Gibson and Thomas, 1999; Grodner and Gibson, 2005; Vasishth et al., 2010). Corpora of naturally-occurring text are unlikely to contain these constructions. More generally, models of human language comprehension are more likely to make distinct predictions for sentences that cause difficulty for humans, rather than for sentences that are easy to process. For instance, models of comprehension difficulty based on memory integration cost during parsing (Gibson, 2000; Lewis and Vasishth, 2005; Schuler et al., 2010; van Schijndel et al., 2013) will predict effects when the memory spans required for parsing are large, but most syntactic dependencies in naturallyoccurring text are short (Temperley, 2007; Liu, 2008; Futrell et al., 2015). In general, processing difficulty might be rare for naturally-occurring text, because text written and edited in order to be easily understood.\nHere we attempt to combine the strength of experimental approaches, which can test theories using targeted low-frequency structures, and corpus studies, which provide broad-coverage comparability between models. We introduce and release a new corpus, the Natural Stories Corpus, a series of English narrative texts designed to contain many low-frequency and psycholinguistically interesting syntactic constructions while still sounding fluent and coherent. The texts are annotated with hand-corrected Penn Treebank style phrase structure parses, and Universal Dependencies parses automatically generated from the phrase structure parses. We also release self-paced\nreading time data for all texts, and word-aligned audio recordings of the texts. We hope the corpus can form the basis for further annotation and become a standard test set for psycholinguistic models."}, {"heading": "2 Related Work", "text": "Here we survey datasets which are commonly used to test psycholinguistic theories and how they relate to the current release.\nCurrently the most prominent psycholinguistic corpus for English is the Dundee Corpus (Kennedy et al., 2003), which contains 51,501 word tokens in 2,368 sentences from British newspaper editorials, along with eyetracking data from 10 participants. A dependency parse of the corpus is released in Barrett et al.. Like in the current work, the eyetracking data in the Dundee corpus is collected for sentences in context and so reflects influences beyond the sentence level. The corpus has seen wide usage, see for example Demberg and Keller (2008); Mitchell et al. (2010); Frank and Bod (2011); Fossum and Levy (2012); Smith and Levy (2013); van Schijndel and Schuler (2015); Luong et al. (2015).\nThe Potsdam Sentence Corpus (Kliegl et al., 2006) of German provides 1138 words in 144 sentences, with cloze probabilities and eyetracking data for each word. Like the current corpus, the Potsdam Sentence Corpus was designed to contain varied syntactic structures, rather than being gathered from naturalistic text. The corpus consists of isolated sentences which do not form a narrative, and during eyetracking data collection the sentences were presented in a random order. The corpus has been used to evaluate models of sentence processing based on dependency parsing (Boston et al., 2008, 2011) and to study effects of predictability on event-related potentials (Dambacher et al., 2006).\nThe MIT Corpus introduced in Bachrach et al. (ms) has similar aims to the current work, collecting reading time and fMRI data over sentences designed to contain varied structures. This dataset consists of four narratives with a total of 2647 tokens; it has been used to evaluate models of incremental prediction in Roark et al. (2009), Wu et al. (2010), and Luong et al. (2015).\nThe UCL Corpus (Frank et al., 2013) consists of 361 English sentences drawn from amateur novels, chosen for their ability to be understood out of context, with self-paced reading and eyetracking data. The goal of the corpus is to provide a sample of typical narrative sentences, complementary\nto our goal of providing a corpus with low-frequency constructions. Unlike the current corpus, the UCL Corpus consists of isolated sentences, so the psychometric data do not reflect effects beyond the sentence level.\nEyetracking corpora for other languages are also available, including the Postdam-Allahabad Hindi Eyetracking Corpus (Husain et al., 2014) and the Beijing Sentence Corpus of Mandarin Chinese (Yan et al., 2010)."}, {"heading": "3 Corpus Description", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Text", "text": "The Natural Stories corpus consists of 10 stories, comprising 10,245 lexical word tokens and 485 sentences in total. The stories were developed by A.V., E.F., E.G. and S.P. by taking existing publicly available texts and editing them to use many subject- and object-extracted relative clauses, clefts, topicalized structures, extraposed relative clauses, sentential subjects, sentential complements, local structural ambiguity (especially NP/Z ambiguity), idioms, and conjoined clauses with a variety of coherence relations. The original texts are listed in Table 1.\nThe mean number of lexical words per sentence is 21.1, around the same as the Dundee corpus (21.7). Figure 1 shows a histogram of sentence length in Natural Stories as compared to Dundee. The word and sentence counts for each story are given in Table 2. Each token has a unique code which is referenced throughout the various annotations of the corpus.\nIn Figure 2 we give a sample of text from the corpus (from the first story).\n2http://www.make4fun.com/stories/British-short-story/3917-The-Legend-of-theBradford-Boar-by-E-H-Hopkinsona\n3http://fullreads.com/literature/aqua-or-the-water-baby/ 4http://stenzel.ucdavis.edu/180/anthology/matchgirl.html 5http://www.apples4theteacher.com/holidays/bird-day/short-stories/the-king-of-the-\nbirds.html 6http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/ElvDie.shtml 7http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/MrStic.shtml 8http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roswell UFO incident&oldid=331989741 9http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tulip mania&oldid=329157998\n10http://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/FactSheets/Tourette-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet"}, {"heading": "3.2 Parses", "text": "The texts were parsed automatically using the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and hand-corrected.

Text was presented in a dashed moving window display; spaces were masked. Each participant read 5 stories per HIT. 19 participants read all 10 stories, and 3 participants stopped after one story. Each story was accompanied by 6 comprehension questions. We discarded SPR data from a participant\u2019s pass through a story if the participant got less than 5 questions correct (89 passes through stories excluded). We also excluded RTs less than 100 ms or greater than 3000 ms. Figure 3 shows histograms of RTs per story."}, {"heading": "3.3.1 Inter-Subject Correlations", "text": "In order to evaluate the reliability of the self-paced reading RTs and their robustness across experimental participants, we analyzed inter-subject cor-\nrelations (ISCs).

Thus for each story we get one ISC statistic per subject. Figure 4 shows histograms of these statistics per story."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Psycholinguistic Sanity Checks", "text": "In order to validate our RT data, we checked that basic psycholinguistic effects obtain in it. In particular, we examined whether the well-known effects of frequency, word length, and surprisal (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008; Smith and Levy, 2013) had an effect on RTs. To do this, for each of the three predictors log frequency, log trigram probability, and word length, we fit a linear mixed effects regression model with subject and story as random intercepts (models with random slopes did not converge) predicting RT. Frequency and trigram probabilities were computed from Google Books N-grams, summing over years from 1990 to 2013. (These counts are also released with this dataset.) The results of the regressions are shown in Table 3; we report results from the maximal converging model. In keeping with well-known ef-\nfects, increased frequency and probability both lead to faster reading times, and word length leads to slower reading times."}, {"heading": "3.4 Syntactic Constructions", "text": "Here we give an overview of the low-frequency or marked syntactic constructions which occur in the stories. We coded sentences in the Natural Stories corpus for presence of a number of marked constructions, and also coded 200 randomly selected sentences from the Dundee corpus for the same features. The features coded are listed and explained in Appendix A. Figure 5 shows the rates of these marked constructions per sentence in the two corpora. From the figure, we see that the natural stories have especially high rates of nonlocal VP conjunction, nonrestrictive SRCs, idioms, adjective conjunction, noncanonical ORCs, local NP/S ambiguities, and it-clefts."}, {"heading": "4 Conclusion", "text": "We have described a new psycholinguistic corpus of English, consisting of edited naturalistic text designed to contain many rare or hard-to-process constructions while still sounding fluent. We believe this corpus will provide an important part of a suite of test sets for psycholinguistic models, exposing their behavior in uncommon constructions in a way that fully naturalistic corpora cannot. We also hope that the corpus as described here forms the basis for further data collection and annotation."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "This work was supported by NSF DDRI grant #1551543 to R.F., NSF grants #0844472 and #1534318 to E.G., and NIH career development award HD057522 to E.F.

However, many of the corpora used in these studies are based on naturalistic text and thus do not contain many of the low-frequency syntactic constructions that are often required to distinguish processing theories. Here we describe a new corpus consisting of English texts edited to contain many low-frequency syntactic constructions while still sounding fluent to native speakers. The corpus is annotated with hand-corrected parse trees and includes self-paced reading time data.
