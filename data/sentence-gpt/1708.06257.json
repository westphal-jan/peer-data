(17)\nIt generates a 2-layer ResNet block, which is much more like the original ResNet. 1 Figure 4 illustrates its basic structure.\nAt a first glance, it appears that directly define the transport velocity as (2) is not natural. But it is actually reasonable. The inner weights W (1) and b(1) are used to adjust the distribution of the transport velocity field according to the location of input. Notice that the activation a is usually non-negative, or even restricted to [0, 1]. Thus the outer weights W (2) and b(2) are needed to adjust the direction and magnitude of the transport velocity. Both inner weights and outer weights are necessary ingredients of the velocity field."}, {"heading": "3.3 Discussions", "text": "The ResNets obtained here are special. Firstly, as we can see in (10) and (17), due to the time step sk, the residual term can be made sufficiently small comparing with the leading term xk. This is a necessary condition for the ResNet to be modeled by transport equation.\nSecondly, the weights of the ResNet changes slowly from block to block. More specifically, the weights on the same positions of adjacent ResNet blocks should be close to each other, because they are assumed to be discretizations of continuous functions of time. For example, W (1) k is close to W (1) k\u22121, W (2) k is close to W (2) k\u22121, and so on.\n1One concern is that the layers of this ResNet are of the same width. This may not be a series problem in theory, because they can always be embedded in to the same high dimensional space."}, {"heading": "3.4 Summary", "text": "Clearly, there is a correspondence between the ResNets (10) (17) and the transport equation (1). This correspondence also exists in plain nets (neural networks without residual shortcuts). It is summarized in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 5."}, {"heading": "4 Discussions", "text": "Claim: The discussions here are not intended to provide solution to any problem in theory and applications of neural networks, nor be able to answer any concern. They only present our ideas about some of candidate directions that could be explored.\n1. In the viewpoint of solving terminal value problem of transport equation, we can also consider other numerical methods intentionally designed for PDEs, besides of the method of characteristics. For example, we can increase regularity of solutions by adding dissipative terms to the transport equation.\n2. The training of neural networks could be considered as solving inverse problem of transport equation. It means that both initial value (on samples) and terminal value are posed. The task is to find a transport velocity field (depending on time) that transports the initial value to the terminal value. It will be made clearer in the rest parts of this series of notes.\n3. The correspondence provides one way to partially explain why deep is good for neural networks. Usually, in order to learn a good prediction map, the dataset needs to be distorted significantly. But the distortion provided by each layer is very limited. So it needs more layers to accomplish the total distortion. In the language of differential equations, deep means fine partition and small time step size. It allows the discretization to be more smooth and regular, such that each layer makes only a small progress. At the same time, the initial and terminal conditions can get a better match through the solution, hence the learnt prediction map is more accurate and can generalize better."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgement", "text": "Zhen Li would like to show his gratitude to the support of professors Yuan Yao and Yang Wang from the Department of Mathematics, HKUST."}], "references": [{"title": "Deep residual learning for image recognition", "author": ["K.
