A relationship is made to other works in Lexical Semantics and Lexicon; the sources are cited where appropriate. If there are no citations, the text is a sole responsibility of the author."}, {"heading": "2 Goal", "text": "The main goal of this work is to illustrate on how to one can possibly represent semantics of sentences using tools presented in the papers ([Pus91], [Fon01]) and others and derive a computational lexicon."}, {"heading": "3 Semantic Analysis", "text": "The below sentence samples have been taken from [Fon01]. All the follow up discussion will be around these examples.\n1. (a) Cathie mended the torn dress.\n(b) Cathie mended the red dress.\nAs Fong herself says in [Fon01], the both events of the above fit the same event template (LCS): (c) [x CAUSE [BECOME [y <mended>]]] This is possible for the lexeme mend1 because 1b has implicit torn adjective in it. I claim that (b) and the below are equivalent: (d) Cathie mended the torn red dress. The red is just a bit more specific type of dress being mended. Otherwise, why would one mend a dress which is not torn? The torn state of the dress changes to become mended; hence, state transition is in place. Another part of dress\u2019 state, as being red is undefined (but is likely to be still the same) at the event culmination. We can build the event structure, ES, LCS\u2019, and LCS following the style of Pustejovsky in [Pus91] and Fong in [Fon01]. I have replaced the not notation to \u201c!\u201d. For ES and LCS\u2019 I use the notation from Pustejovsky, and LCS is from Fong because it resembles more conventional use of predicates than that of Pustejovsky.\n2 ES: T\n/ \\\n/ \\\nLCS\u2019: P S\n| |\nact(m, dress) & torn(dress) !torn(dress)\n|\nmended(dress)\nLCS: [m CAUSE [BECOME [dress <mended>]]]\nAs for the refined structure for a specific, red, dress it won\u2019t change much, that just a part of state will remain the same.\nES: T\n/ \\\n/ \\\nLCS\u2019: P S\n| |\nact(m, dress) & torn(dress) !torn(dress) & red(dress)\n& red(dress) |\nmended(dress) & red(dress)\nLCS: [m CAUSE [BECOME [dress <mended>]]] & [IS [dress <red>]]\nOne may argue, that the dress might change the color during the mending process because we can only guess that it is still red but don\u2019t have enough evidence from the sentence being analyzed that the red property persists. Then we could adjust the state template [IS [dress <red>]] to be [IS [dress <red>] | IS [dress [NOT <red>]]] and assign the first part of the disjunct a higher likelihood than the second (I use \u201c|\u201d to indicate OR and \u201c&\u201d to indicate AND). In this analysis if we assume red being a constant throughout the process we can claim than the original template (c) holds. Since it is a transition, we could also write (notational sugar): (e) Tmendedtorn (dress) & red(dress).\n2. (a) The plumber fixed every leaky faucet.\n(b) The plumber fixed every blue faucet.\nThese two examples are similar to that of (1). Both assume the faucets fixed were leaking water, hence there\u2019s a state transition with respect to the property of every fixed faucet to become not\n3 leaky. Additional semantic bit in here is that the adjective every makes it plural and this fact may shift the event type sometimes.\nES: T\n/ \\\n/ \\\nLCS\u2019: P S\n| |\nact(p, every(faucet)) !leaky(faucet)\n& leaky(faucet) |\nfixed(faucet)\nLCS (1): [p CAUSE [BECOME [EVERY [faucet <fixed>]]]] LCS (2): [p CAUSE [BECOME [faucets <fixed>]]]\nThe second case restricts the act of fixing only to leaky blue faucets (there may be, let say, leaky red faucets that have not been not fixed). The blue property of (b) does not change since it is not in the opposition to or in a synnet with leaky.\nES: T\n/ \\\n/ \\\nLCS\u2019: P S\n| |\nact(p, every(faucet)) !leaky(faucet) & blue(faucet)\n& blue(faucet) |\n& leaky(faucet) fixed(faucet) & blue(faucet)\nLCS (1): [p CAUSE [BECOME [EVERY [faucet <fixed>]]]] & [IS [faucet <blue>]] LCS (2): [p CAUSE [BECOME [faucets <fixed>]]] & [ARE [faucets <blue>]]\nNOTE: In the above, I (perhaps astonishingly incorrectly) use EVERY as if it were a predicate to enumerate all the faucet instances that could be replaced by a normal (\u201cfor-all\u201d) symbol (forgot how to spell it in LATEX) and a variable as we do in predicate logic, or as in LCS (2) use plural form instead (this actually helps understand and encode semantics of an NP).

The act of filling for the waiter is a process, whereas for emty glasses having become full is a change of state, hence a transition, with a subtype of accomplishment because the ajective every makes the completed.\n7 ES: T\n/ \\\n/ \\\nLCS\u2019: P S\n| |\nact(w, every(glass) !empty(glass)\n& empty(glass) |\nfull(glass) & filled-with(water)\nLCS (1): [w CAUSE [BECOME [EVERY [glass <filled-with-water>]]]]\nNOTE: the state <filled-with-water> may be broken into a finer granularity in LCS predicates like it\u2019s done in LCS\u2019.\n10.

(a) is a typical process which does not entail the final state of the carpet (it might still remain partially dirty), whereas (b) is an accomplishment event because it has the transition with the culmination point from a process to state being clean as a result of John\u2019s action.

The first type of lexical entries in our lexicon, lexemes, will comply with the feature structure presented in [Mok03], Figure 1. The structure was originally derived from [JM00] and [Arn01]. For this work we simplify the lexeme structure by leaving out the phonological form of the lexeme because it is unused throughout the paper. Likewise, our lexicon is rather short and we do not deal with polysemy, the SENSE feature will be a scalar value rather than a set of related senses. Hence, our lexeme will have the structure presented Figure 2.\nThe new lexeme representation is a 3-tuple of the form: name{X,S, T}, where X is the word\u2019s spelling, S is its sense, T is its POS tag, and name is a name of the lexeme, an index, uniquely identifying the lexical entry in the lexicon. The tag T is of a Penn Tagset, [Sat90]. The word sense has been adapted from the online Webster\u2019s dictionary, [web03].\nPustejovsky and Fong seem to drift away from the feature-based approach in their work as being not scalable for a decent computational lexicon.

These entries can be linked to the appropriate lexemes and their compositions. Note, the variables in these templates also have restrictions of what they can be (i.e. which lexemes they can be assigned to). For example, for causative verbs there has to be an animate agent (eg. Cathie) or a subject that can have an animate role (eg. as Microsoft Corporation in \u201cMicrosoft Corporation was not afraid of law suits against it.\u201d). This is to say that a carpet cannot mend a dress, for example. Making an analogy to security in computing world, these facts can be added to the lexicon as a data structure similar to an ACL (access-control list) matrix that indicates which semantic capabilities lexemes posses or do not posses based on their roles.\nThe below is the list of event templates pertinent to the examples copied nearly verbatim from the\nES, LCS\u2019 and LCS analysis.

Additionally, we can infer some it from the Semantic Analysis (Section 3) and make up a template-like structure.\nFor example, [IS [y z]] can be used to represent a state of a noun z with a property of y. It can be nested ([IS [IS [dress \u00a1red\u00bf] \u00a1torn\u00bf]]) and can be stored in the event template list. This is roughly equivalent to the below, on which semantic restriction is imposed, however (the set of values z and y, or JJ and NN, can take):\nNP -> JJ NP NP -> NN\nThus, for our little lexicon we could write a few entries for the simple noun phrases we have:\n1. plain-single-state: {S, [IS [y z]]}\n2. mixture: {S, [IS [y z] & IS [a b]]}\n3. multi-state: {S, [IS [IS [x y] z]]}\n4.2.3.2 Adverbials As it has been shown in the analysis, the adverbs, such as clean2 and blue2 shift the event type from P to T .\n[TO BE COMPLETED] This can be encoded as a set of state rules, where input would be an /RB lexeme, it\u2019s corresponding value in the referenced by the LET matrix (see below; sorry for jumping a little), if it yeilds 1, then change the event type of such a rule from P to T .

Using the event templates along with the lexeme\u2019s features we could cover a lot more semantically correct phrases and sentences without unnecessary lexicon bloat as with pure feature-based model. This makes the lexicon match the infinite possibilities of a natural language in capturing semantics rather than defining it as a finite set of lexemes.\nAdding a \u201clexeme semantic capabilities\u201d list (LSCL) could also restrain the templates the lexemes can be plugged into w/o cluttering the list of lexemes with pointer to allowed templates or the reverse. It can also be a lexeme-event-template (LET) matrix with rows as event templates indexes and columns are lexemes with a boolean entry indicating which x, y, and z (lexeme variables) allowed to be used in which templates.\n14\nAlso, another observation that I made is when I put down all the event templates in the lexicon, with the names that all had \u201c-state\u201d in them. I did not do it intentionally rather more subconciously. After noticing this, I thought that possibly we can model all this template structure as states only and allowed transitions between them. (This is a strongly personal opinion. I have not looked at the FrameNet project myself; only the presentation. Maybe the do the same?).\nThus a new definition, explicitly stated, of a computational lexicon would be:\n1. A set of lexemes (feature-based).\n2. A set of event templates.\n3.

Both papers mostly focus on the lexical semantics of verbs as related to events and almost no credit given to the semantics of NPs and others in relationship to the work done. None explicitly define what their lexical items in the lexicon would be and why. The presented material, however, allows to derive the meaning representation of the noun phrases, adverbials, and prepositional phrases and how they can shift event type from one another.\nIt is my belief that the resulting lexicon is quite comprehensive. The presented instances of it, however, are not perfect and incomplete and there\u2019s no time left to fix them as this is being written. Thus, I will briefly summarize the current shortcomings of the above lexicon instance: the lexemes have the sense feature which is currently presented as just a dictionary (or my own) definition used for the sense in the example sentences. It has no event types or links to the templates in them. Instead, I could remove that feature altogether from the lexeme structure in favour template approach, but keep the rest. I have not provided a concrete example of the LCSL or LET structures to restrict lexemes to the templates. Additionally, these structures may suffer from large data sparseness as in the example of LET matrix making computational and storage aspect questionable w/o any optimization steps. I have not explored the semantic relations issue and the necessity of the SRM matrix, which is also likely to be sparse.\nDerivation of the new entries for a general-purpose computational lexicon could be done through the semantic relations and analysis of verbs argument structure, categories, PPs, which are not explored in this work.\nIf this all is not at all sensible and hurts the beautiful mind, please forgive me for the pain I caused with my work. A lot more research, information-digesting, and summarizing time is required to produce a more quality work. Thus, consider this as a humble draft.\n15"}], "references": [{"title": "in: Introduction to Linguistics; course notes", "author": ["Doug Arnold.
