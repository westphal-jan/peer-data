For example, histories of email correspondences can be represented by a tensor with 4 modes (sender, receiver, date, content); and user customer ratings can be represented by a tenor with four modes (user, item, rating, time). Therefore there is a critical need for principled multiway data analysis tools.\nTraditional multiway factor models\u2014 such as the Tucker decomposition [21] and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) [6]\u2014have been widely applied in many areas (e.g. , network traffic analysis [24], computer vision [17] and social network analysis [18, 14, 19], etc). These models, however, face serious challenges for modeling complex multiway interactions. First the interactions between entities in each mode may be coupled together and highly nonlinear. The classical multi-linear models cannot capture these intricate relationships. Second, the tensor data are often noisy and contain many outliers; classical models are not designed to handle outliers. Third, the data may not be restricted to real values; they can be binary as in dynamic network data or they may have ordinal values for user-movie-ratings. The classical models treat all these data as real-valued and this treatment would lead to degenerated predictive performance.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a robust nonparametric multiway analysis model, InfTucker . It conducts the Tucker decomposition in an infinite dimensional feature space, which captures nonlinear interactions between different tensor modes. Compared with the tensor-variate Gaussian process approaches [7, 23], the t-processbased InfTucker is more robust (not sensitive to data outliers). Furthermore, it handles various data types (e.g. , incomplete or binary data) by adopting suitable probabilistic data likelihoods.\nAlthough our nonparametric models offer elegant solutions to robust multiway analysis, computationally it is difficult to train them from multi-aspect data. To overcome this computational difficulty, we develop an efficient variational Bayesian approach that explores the tensor structures to reduce the computational cost.\nIn summary, the major contributions of this paper include: i. We propose a tensor-variate latent t process model, InfTucker , for robust multiway\ndata analysis. Recently several nonparametric Bayesian models on matrices and tensors [5, 23, 4] have been developed, but they are either designed for different tasks (e.g. , multitask learning)\u2014-rather than multiway analysis\u2014or use a linear kernel to make the computation feasible in practice. By contrast, based on latent t-processes, our model conducts robust nonlinear Tucker decomposition. ii. We present a novel technique that reduces the computational complexity of variational inference on tensors. Specifically, for a K-mode tensor with nk entities in each mode, our algorithm has O(\n\u2211K k=1 n 3 k + ( \u2211K k=1 nk) \u220fK k=1 nk) time and\nO( \u2211K k=1 n 2 k + \u220fK k=1 nk) space complexities, instead of the O( \u220fK k=1 n 3 k) time and O( \u220fK\nk=1 n 2 k) space complexities of a na\u0131\u0308ve inference technique. The efficient\ninference technique enables us to use tensor-variate t-processes with nonlinear covariance functions. iii. Our experimental results on chemometrics and social network datasets demonstrate that the InfTucker achieves significantly higher prediction accuracy than\nseveral state-of-art tensor decomposition approaches including High Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) [10], Weighted CP [1] and nonnegative tensor decomposition [17]."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminary", "text": "Notations. Throughout this paper, we denote scalars by lower case letters (e.g. a), vectors by bold lower case letters (e.g. a), matrices by bold upper case letters (e.g. A), and tensors by calligraphic upper case letters (e.g. A). Calligraphic upper case letters are also used for probability distributions, e.g., N (\u00b5,\u03a3). We use uij to represent the (i, j) entry of a matrix U, yi to represent the i = (i1, . . . , iK) entry of a tensor Y . U \u2297 V denotes the Kronecker product of the two matrices there.

We extend classical Tucker decomposition in three aspects: i) flexible noise models for both continuous and binary observations; ii) an infinite core tensor to model complex interactions; and iii) latent t process prior, which makes the model robust to outliers.\n1Unlike the usual column-wise vec-operation, our definition of vec() on matrices is row-wise, which avoids the use of transpose in many equations throughout this paper.\nMore specifically, we assume the observed tensor Y is sampled from a latent realvalued tensor M via a probabilistic noise model p(Y|M) = \u220f\ni p(yi|mi). We conduct Tucker decomposition of M with a core tensor W of infinite size.

The above relation implies that we can actually compute the singular value decomposition of \u03a5 = V\u039bV from covariance matrices \u03a3(k).\nIn order to efficiently compute tr(\u03a3\u22121p \u03a5) appearing in equation (16), we use the following relations\ntr(\u03a3\u22121p \u03a5) = tr(\u03a3 \u22121 p V \u22a4\u039bV) = tr(\u039bV\u03a3\u22121p V \u22a4) = diag(V\u03a3\u22121p V \u22a4)\u22a4 diag(\u039b)\n= d1 \u2297 . . .\u2297 dK diag(\u039b) = d1 \u2297 . . .\u2297 dK vec(D)\n= D \u00d71 d1 . . .\u00d7K dK , (18)\nwhere dk = diag(V(k)(\u03a3(k))\u22121V(k) \u22a4 )\u22a4 with \u03a3(k) being a computed statistics in the E-step, diag(\u039b) denotes the diagonal elements of \u039b, and D is a tensor of size n1 \u00d7 . . .\u00d7 nK , such that vec(D) = diag(\u039b). Both time and space complexities of the last formula (18) is O(\n\u220fK k=1 nk).\nWe denote V = [V(1), . . . ,V(K)] and V\u22a4 = [V(1)\u22a4, . . . ,V(K)\u22a4]. For any tensor A of the same size as D, \u039b vec(A) means multiplying the j-th element of vec(A) by the \u039bjj , which is the j-th element of vecD. So we have \u039b vec(A) = vec(D \u2299 A), where \u2299 denotes the Hadamard product, i.e. entry-wise product. In light of this relation, we can efficiently compute (12) by\n\u03a5 vec(Eq [Z]) = vec [ ((Eq [Z]\u00d7 V \u22a4)\u2299D)\u00d7 V ] . (19)\nThe right-hand side of Equation (19) effectively reduce the time and space complexities of the left-hand side operations toO(\n\u2211K k=1 n 3 k+( \u2211K k=1 nk) \u220fK k=1 nk) andO( \u2211K k=1 n 2 k+\n\u220fK k=1 nk), respectively.\nWe can further reduce the complexities by approximating the covariance matrices via truncated SVD. If the first tk leading eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors are preserved, the time complexity of our algorithm is O(\n\u2211K k=1 n 2 ktk+( \u2211K k=1 nk) \u220fK k=1 tk),\nand the space complexity is O( \u2211K k=1 nktk + \u220fK k=1 tk)."}, {"heading": "5 Related Works", "text": "The InfTucker model extends Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) [20] and Gaussian process latent variable models (GPLVMs) [11]: while PPCA and GPLVM model interactions of one mode of a matrix and ignore the joint interactions of two modes, InfTucker does.\nOur model is related to previous tensor-variate GPs Yu et al. [23], Yu and Chu [22]. The main difference lies in the fact they used linear covariance functions to reduce the computational complexities and dealt with matrix-variate data for online recommendation and link prediction.\nOur model is closely related to the probabilistic Tucker-3 (pTucker) model [5]; actually InfTucker reduces to pTucker as a special case as \u03bd \u2192 \u221e. Also, Hoff [7] proposed a hierarchical Bayesian extension to CANDECOMP/PARAFAC that captures the interaction of component matrices. Unlike both [5]\u2019s and Hoff [7]\u2019s approach, ours handles non-Gaussian noise and uses nonlinear covariance functions to model complex interactions. In addition, [7] used a Gibbs sampler for inference\u2014its convergence incurs high computational cost and makes this approach infeasible for tensors with moderate and large sizes.\nTo handle missing data, enhance model interpretability, and avoid overfitting, several extensions to non-probabilistic tensor decomposition have been proposed, including nonnegative tensor decomposition (NTD) [17, 8, 13, 15] and Weighted tensor decomposition (WTD) [1]. These models solve the core tensors explicitly and do not handle nonlinear multiway interactions.\nFinally, note that the inference technique described in Section 4 can be adopted for Gaussian process or t-process multi-task learning [4, 25]. Let M be the number of tasks and N be the number of data points in each task. Our inference technique can be used to reduce their time complexity from O(M3N3) to O(M3 + N3) and the space complexity from O(M2N2) to O(N2 +M2)."}, {"heading": "6 Experiments", "text": "To evaluate the proposed InfTucker decomposition method, we conduct two batches of experiments: one for the setting with the Gaussian noise and the other for the probit noise. For both settings, we compare InfTucker with the following conventional and state-of-the-arts tensor decomposition methods: CP, Tucker decomposition (TD), Nonnegative CP (NCP), High Order SVD (HOSVD), and Weighted CP (WCP). All of\nthese comparison methods are implemented in the tensor toolbox2. Experiment on Gaussian Noise Model Experimental setting: We employ four continuous chemometrics datasets3, namely amino, bread, flow injection, and suger. Their dimensions are 5\u00d7201\u00d761, 10\u00d711\u00d78, 12\u00d7 100\u00d7 89, and 268\u00d7 571\u00d7 7, respectively. All the above datasets are normalized to have zero mean and unite variance. For each dataset, we randomly split all the tensor coordinates to 5 folds via cross-validation: each time one fold used for testing and the other four folds for training. This procedure is repeated for 10 times. Thus in total, for each dataset, all algorithms are repeated 50 times. In InfTucker , the degree of freedom \u03bd in the tensor-variate t process is fixed to 10. We employ the Gaussian/exponential covariance functions \u03a3(k)(ui,uj) = e\u2212\u03b3\u2016ui\u2212uj\u2016 t\n, where t = 1, 2 and \u03b3 is selected from [0.01 : 0.05 : 1] by 5-fold cross validation. The regularization parameter \u03bb for InfTucker is chosen from {1, 10, 100}.\nResults: Since for all these datasets we do not know the true latent factors, we use the prediction accuracy on hold out edges to compare all these models. For easy comparison of all algorithms, we set the same number of latent factors for all modes. We varied the number of the latent factors, r, from 3 to 5 and computed the averaged MSE values and standard deviations for all algorithms. Due to the relatively low dimensionality of certain modes in the above mentioned tensors, we find that when r = 3, the MSEs are all near optimal. Thus we only reported the MSEs for r = 3 in Table 1, where the lowest MSE value and those not significantly worse than it (achieved by t-test with 95% confidence level) are highlighted. It is not hard to find that InfTucker achieves the lowest MSEs on all data. This may be due to the so-called \u201ckernel trick\u201d that the non-linear covariance functions provide more flexibility in modeling the interaction among all modes. Among the comparison methods, WCP ranks the second best, while HOSVD is the worst due to the strong constraint on the non-negativity of latent factors.\nExperiment on Probit Noise Model Experimental setting: We extracted three binary multi-way social network datasets,\nnoted as Enron, Digg1, and Digg2, as our evaluation data. Enron is a relational dataset\n2http://csmr.ca.sandia.gov/\u02dctgkolda/TensorToolbox/ 3Available from http://www.models.kvl.dk/datasets\ndescribing the three-way relation: sender-receiver-email. This dataset, extracted from the Enron email4, has the dimensionality of 203 \u00d7 203 \u00d7 200 with 0.01% non-zero elements. The Digg1 and Digg2 datasets are all extracted from a social news website digg.com5. Digg1 describes a three-way relation: news-keyword-topic, and Digg2 describes a four-way relation: user-news-keyword-topic. Digg1 has the dimensionality of 581\u00d7 124\u00d7 48 with 0.024% non-zero elements, and Digg2 has the dimensionality of 22 \u00d7 109 \u00d7 330 \u00d7 30 with 0.002% non-zero elements. All these datasets are very sparse.\nResults: We adopt similar settings to the Gaussian noise case except that r is varied from {3,5,8,10,15,20} due to the larger dimension of each mode. Since the data are binary, MSE cannot well reveal the existence of a missing link in social networks. Therefore, we evaluate all the algorithms by Area Under Curve (AUC) values averaged over 50 runs. The larger the AUC values, the better. In InfTucker , we use Eq [M] as predictions to calculate the AUC values. We report the averaged AUC values for all algorithms in Figure 1. It is observed that the proposed InfTucker model sufficiently outperforms all the other models. The failure of the traditional models like CP and TD is that the least square minimization used in these models easily leads to almost all zero predictions since the tensor datasets are highly sparse. This experiment indicates the necessity of probit noise models for binary data."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusion", "text": "We proposed a new nonparametric Bayesian tensor decomposition framework, InfTucker , where the observation tensor is modeled as a draw from a tensor-variate t process. This framework is able to flexibly model the interdependence among multimodes by conducting tensor decomposition in the infinite feature space. It can also deal with several types of data, e.g. incomplete data and binary data, via various noise modeling approaches, while most traditional methods rely on least square estimations. As a significant contribution, we also proposed an efficient variational approach to estimate the component matrices. Experimental results on chemometrics and social network datasets demonstrate that the new InfTucker model achieves significantly higher prediction accuracy than several state-of-art tensor decomposition approaches.\n4Available from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/\u02dcenron/ 5Available from http://www.public.asu.edu/\u02dcylin56/kdd09sup.html"}, {"heading": "A Proof of Theorem 2", "text": "Proof Sketch If W(r) \u223c T T (\u03bd,0, {Ir}Kk=1), then vec(W (r)) \u223c T (\u03bd,0, IrK).

for multiway data analysis. Many popular tensor decomposition approaches\u2014such as the Tucker decomposition and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)\u2014conduct multi-linear factorization. They are insufficient to model (i) complex interactions between data entities, (ii) various data types (e.g. missing data and binary data), and (iii) noisy observations and outliers. To address these issues, we propose a tensor-variate latent t process model, InfTucker , for robust multiway data analysis: it conducts robust Tucker decomposition in an infinite feature space. Unlike classical tensor decomposition models, it handles both continuous and binary data in a probabilistic framework. Unlike previous nonparametric Bayesian models on matrices and tensors, our latent t-process model focuses on multiway analysis and uses nonlinear covariance functions. To efficiently learn InfTucker from data, we develop a novel variational inference technique on tensors. Compared with classical implementation, the new technique reduces both time and space complexities by several orders of magnitude. This technique can be easily adopted in other contexts (e.g. , multitask learning) where we encounter tensor-variate t processes or Gaussian processes. Our experimental results on chemometrics and social network datasets demonstrate that the new InfTucker model achieves significantly higher prediction accuracy than several state-of-art tensor decomposition approaches including High Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), Weighted CP, and nonnegative tensor decomposition.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
