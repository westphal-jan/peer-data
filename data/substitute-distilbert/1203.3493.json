It consists of four parts: a sequence of decisions, a set of chance variables with a joint distribution represented by a hybrid Bayesian network (BN), the decision maker\u2019s preferences for the uncertain outcomes represented by a joint utility function that factors additively, and information constraints that indicate which uncertainties are known (and which are unknown) when a decision has to be made. IDs were initially defined by [8].\nHybrid IDs are IDs containing a mix of discrete and continuous chance and decision variables. In practice, most decision problems are hybrid. However, solving a hybrid ID involves two main computational challenges. First, marginalizing a continuous chance variable involves integration of a product of density and utility functions. In some cases, such as the Gaussian density\nfunction, there may not exist a closed-form representation of the integral. We will refer to this problem as the integration problem.\nSecond, marginalizing a decision variable involves maximizing a utility function. If the decision variable is continuous and has relevant continuous information predecessors, then we may be faced with the problem of finding a closed-form solution of the maximization problem. Not only do we have to find the maximum value of the decision variable (as a function of the states of its relevant information predecessors), we have also to find a closed-form expression of the maximum utility (as a function of the states of its relevant information predecessors). We will refer to this problem as the optimization problem.\nA traditional method for solving hybrid IDs is to approximate a hybrid ID with a discrete ID by discretizing the continuous chance and decision variables (see, e.g., [9]). If we discretize a continuous variable using a few bins, we may have an unacceptable approximation of the problem. On the other hand, if we use many bins, we increase the computational effort of solving the resulting discrete ID. In the BN literature, [10] describes a dynamic non-uniform discretization technique for chance variables depending on where the posterior density lies. This technique needs to be adapted for solving hybrid IDs.\nAnother method for solving hybrid IDs is to use Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. One of the earliest to suggest MC methods for solving decision trees was [6], where the entire joint distribution is sampled. [2] proposes a MC method that samples from a small set of chance variables at a time for each decision variable. [13] proposes several MC methods and provide bounds on the number of samples required given some error bounds. [1] explores using Markov chain MC methods to solve a single-stage decision problem with continuous decision and chance nodes to solve the maximization problem.\nAmong exact methods, [16] provides a theory to solve\nIDs where all chance and decision variables are continuous. The continuous chance variables have conditional linear Gaussian (CLG) distributions, and the utility function is quadratic. Such IDs are called Gaussian IDs. These assumptions ensure that the joint distribution of all chance variables is multivariate normal whose marginals can be easily found without the need for integration. Also, the quadratic nature of the utility function ensures that there is a unique maximum than can be computed in closed form without the need for solving an optimization problem.\n[14] extends Gaussian IDs to include discrete chance variables that do not have continuous parents. If a continuous chance variable does not have a CLG distribution, then it can be approximated by a mixture of Gaussians represented by a discrete variable with mixture weights and a continuous variable with the discrete variable as its parent and with a CLG distribution.\nTo find marginals in hybrid BNs, [12] proposes approximating probability density functions (PDF) by mixtures of truncated exponentials (MTE) as a solution for the integration problem. The family of MTE functions is easy to integrate, is closed under combination and marginalization, and can be propagated using the Shenoy-Shafer architecture [18]. [4] describes MTE IDs, where the PDFs of continuous chance variables, and utility functions, are described using MTE functions. Thus any PDF can be used as long as they can be approximated by MTE. Discrete variables can have continuous parents, and there is no restriction on the nature of the utility function.\nSimilar to MTE, [21] proposes approximating PDFs by piecewise polynomial functions called mixture of polynomials (MOP). Like MTE, MOP functions are closed under multiplication and integration. Thus, they can be used to find exact marginals in hybrid BNs. MOP functions have some advantages over MTE functions. MOP approximations can be easily found using the Taylor series for differentiable functions, even for multidimensional functions. Also, they are closed for a larger class of deterministic functions than MTE functions, which are closed only for linear deterministic functions.\n[3] describes arc reversals in hybrid BNs that contain a mix of discrete, continuous, and deterministic variables. The conditionals for discrete variables are represented by discrete potentials, for continuous variables by density potentials, and for deterministic variables by Dirac potentials (containing a weighted sum of Dirac delta functions [5]). The deterministic function does not have to be linear or invertible. The only requirement is that it should be differentiable. [20]\nextends this framework by defining mixed potentials, and combination marginalization operations for mixed potentials. They call their framework the extended Shenoy-Shafer architecture.\nIn this paper, we propose further extending the extended Shenoy-Shafer architecture for solving hybrid IDs that include deterministic chance variables. The solution technique is conceptually the same as the one proposed by [17] for discrete decision problems. We extend this method to include continuous and deterministic chance variables, and continuous decision variables. To address the integration problem, we propose MOP approximations of PDFs and utility functions. Since MOP functions are easily integrable, finding the maximum of a utility function that is in MOP form is also easier.\nAn outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we describe the framework and an algorithm to solve hybrid IDs with deterministic variables. In section 3, we describe MOP functions. In section 4, we solve two small decision problems to illustrate our framework and algorithm. Finally, in section 5, we conclude with a summary and discussion on the limitations of our algorithm."}, {"heading": "2 The Extended Shenoy-Shafer Framework", "text": "In this section, we describe a framework and an algorithm for solving hybrid IDs with deterministic variables. The algorithm described is adapted from [17, 11]. The framework described here is a further extension of the extended Shenoy-Shafer architecture described in [20] for inference in hybrid Bayesian networks with deterministic variables. Here, we include decision variables, and utility potentials. Mixed potentials are a triple of discrete, continuous, and utility potentials. The definition of marginalization of mixed potentials is revised to accommodate non-associativity of multiplication and addition in the definition of combination of potentials.\nVariables and States. We are concerned with a finite set V = D \u222a C of variables. Variables in D are called decision variables, and variables in C are called chance variables. Each variable X \u2208 V is associated with a set \u2126X of possible states. If \u2126X is finite or countable, we say X is discrete, otherwise X is continuous. We will assume that the state space of continuous variables is the set of real numbers, and that the state space of discrete variables is a set of symbols (not necessarily real numbers). If r \u2286 V , r 6= \u2205, then \u2126r = \u00d7{\u2126X |X \u2208 r}. If r = \u2205, we will adopt the convention that \u2126\u2205 = {\u22c4}.\nWe will distinguish between discrete chance variables and continuous chance variables. Let Cd denote the set of all discrete chance variables and let Cc denote the set of all continuous chance variables. Then, C = Cd \u222a Cc. We do not distinguish between discrete and continuous decision variables.\nIn an ID, each chance variable has a conditional distribution function for each state of its parents. A conditional distribution function associated with a continuous variable is said to be deterministic if the variances (for each state of its parents) are all zeros. For simplicity, henceforth, we will refer to continuous variables with non-deterministic conditionals as continuous, and continuous variables with deterministic conditionals as deterministic.\nIn an ID, we will depict decision variables by rectangular nodes, discrete chance variables by singlebordered elliptical nodes, continuous chance variables by double-bordered elliptical nodes, deterministic chance variables by triple-bordered elliptical chance nodes, and additive factors of the joint utility function by diamond-shaped nodes. We do not distinguish between discrete and continuous decision variables.\nProjection of States. If x \u2208 \u2126r, y \u2208 \u2126s, and r \u2229 s = \u2205, then (x,y) \u2208 \u2126r\u222as. Thus, (x, \u22c4) = x. Suppose x \u2208 \u2126r, and s \u2286 r. Then, the projection of x to s, denoted by x\u2193s, is the state of s obtained from x by dropping states of r\\s. Thus, e.g., (w, x, y, z)\u2193{W,X} = (w, x), where w \u2208 \u2126W , and x \u2208 \u2126X . If s = r, then x\u2193s = x. If s = \u2205, then x\u2193s = \u22c4.\nDiscrete Potentials. In an ID, the conditional probability functions associated with chance variables are represented by functions called potentials. If A is discrete, it is associated with a conditional probability mass function. The conditional probability mass functions are represented by functions called discrete potentials. Suppose r \u2286 V is such that if it is nonempty then it contains a discrete variable. A discrete potential for r is a function \u03b1 : \u2126r \u2192 [0, 1]. The values of discrete potentials are probabilities.\nAlthough the domain of the potential \u03b1 is \u2126r, we will refer to r as the domain of \u03b1. Thus, the domain of a potential representing the conditional probability function associated with some chance variable X in an ID is always the set {X}\u222apa(X), where pa(X) denotes the set of parents of X in the ID graph. Notice that a discrete potential can have continuous chance variables or decision variables in its domain, but, in this case, it must also include a discrete chance variable, i.e., if the domain of a discrete potential is non-empty, then it must include a discrete variable. The values of discrete potentials are always in units of probability.\nDensity Potentials. Continuous chance variables are typically associated with conditional PDFs. Conditional PDFs are represented by functions called density potentials. Suppose r \u2286 V is such that if it is nonempty then it contains a continuous variable. A density potential \u03b6 for r is a function \u03b6 : \u2126r \u2192 R+, where R+ is the set of non-negative real numbers. The values of density potentials are probability densities. Notice that a density potential can have discrete chance variables or decision variables in its domain, but, in this case, it must include a continuous chance variable, and its values are always in units of (probability) density.\nDirac Delta Functions. Deterministic variables have conditional distributions described by equations. We will represent such distributions by Dirac potentials that use Dirac delta functions \u03b4 [5].\n\u03b4 : R \u2192 R+ is called a Dirac delta function if \u03b4(x) = 0 if x 6= 0, and \u222b\n\u03b4(x)dx = 1. Whenever the limits of integration of an integral are not specified, the entire range (\u2212\u221e,\u221e) is to be understood. \u03b4 is not a proper function since the value of the function at 0 doesn\u2019t exist (i.e., is not finite). It can be regarded as a limit of a certain sequence of functions (such as, e.g., the Gaussian density function with mean 0 and variance \u03c32 in the limit as \u03c3 \u2192 0). However, it can be used as if it were a proper function for practically all our purposes without getting incorrect results. It was first defined by Dirac [5].\nDirac Potentials. Suppose t = r\u222as is a set of variables containing some discrete variables r and some continuous chance variables s, and suppose s 6= \u2205. A Dirac potential for t is a function \u03be : \u2126t \u2192 R+ such that \u03be(r, s) is of the form:\n\u03be(r, s) = \u03a3{pr,i\u03b4(z \u2212 gr,i(s \u2193(s\\{Z})))|r \u2208 \u2126r,\ni = 1, . . . , nr}, (1)\nwhere r \u2208 \u2126r, s \u2208 \u2126s, Z \u2208 s is a continuous or deterministic variable, z \u2208 \u2126Z , \u03b4(z \u2212 gr,i(s\u2193(s\\{Z}))) are Dirac delta functions, pr,i are probabilities for all i = 1, . . . , nr, and nr is a positive integer. Here, we are assuming that continuous or deterministic variable Z is a weighted sum of deterministic functions gr,i(s\n\u2193(s\\{Z})) of the other continuous variables in s, with probability weights pr,i, and that the nature of the deterministic functions and weights may depend on the state r of the discrete variables in r, or on some latent index i. Like density potentials, Dirac potentials must include a continuous variable in its domain if it is non-empty, and its values are in units of density.\nContinuous Potentials. Both density and Dirac potentials are special instances of a broader class of\npotentials called continuous potentials. Suppose t \u2286 V is such that if it is non-empty then it contains a continuous chance variable. Then, a continuous potential for t is a function \u03be : \u2126t \u2192 R+. Like density and Dirac potentials, continuous potentials must include a continuous variable in its domain if it is non-empty, and its values are in units of density.\nUtility Potentials. An ID representation includes utility functions, that represent the preferences of the decision maker for the various outcomes. If an ID has more than one utility node, we assume an additive factorization of the joint utility function. Each additive factor of the utility function is represented by a utility potential. A utility potential \u03c5 for t \u2286 V is a function \u03c5 : \u2126t \u2192 R. The values of utility potentials are in units of utiles.\nMixed Potentials. To keep track of the nature of potentials, we define mixed potentials. A mixed potential has three parts. The first part is a discrete potential, the second is a continuous potential, and the third is a utility potential. Suppose \u03b1 is a discrete potential for r. Then, a mixed potential representation of \u03b1 is \u00b5 = (\u03b1, \u03b9c, \u03b9u), where \u03b9c denotes the identity continuous potential for \u2205, \u03b9c(\u22c4) = 1, and \u03b9u denotes the identity utility potential for \u2205, \u03b9u(\u22c4) = 0. Suppose \u03b6 is a continuous potential for s. Then, a mixed potential representation of \u03b6 is \u00b5 = (\u03b9d, \u03b6, \u03b9u), where \u03b9d denotes the discrete identity potential for \u2205, \u03b9d(\u22c4) = 1. Finally, if \u03c5 is a utility potential for t, then a mixed potential representation of \u03c5 is \u00b5 = (\u03b9d, \u03b9c, \u03c5). \u03b9d is a discrete potential for \u2205 whose value is in units of probability, \u03b9c is a continuous potential for \u2205 whose value is in units of density, and \u03b9u is an utility potential for \u2205 whose value is in units of utiles.\nCombination of Potentials. The definition of combination of potentials depends on the nature (discrete, continuous, or utility) of potentials. Although there are nine permutations, we have only two distinct definitions. Utility functions are additive factors of the joint utility function. Thus, combination of two utility potentials involves pointwise addition. In all other eight cases, combination of potentials involves pointwise multiplication.\nSuppose \u03c51 is a utility potential for t1 and \u03c52 is a utility potential for t2. Then, the combination of \u03c51 and \u03c52, denoted by \u03c51 \u2297 \u03c52, is a utility potential for t1 \u222a t2 given by:\n(\u03c51\u2297\u03c52)(x) = \u03c51(x \u2193t1)+\u03c52(x \u2193t2) for all x \u2208 \u2126t1\u222at2 . (2)\nSuppose \u03b11 is a potential (discrete, continuous, or utility) for t1 and \u03b12 is a potential (discrete, continuous,\nor utility) for t2. Suppose that both \u03b11 and \u03b12 are not both utility. Then, the combination of \u03b11 and \u03b12, denoted by \u03b11 \u2297\u03b12, is a potential for t1 \u222a t2 given by:\n(\u03b11 \u2297 \u03b12)(x) = \u03b11(x \u2193t1)\u03b12(x \u2193t2) for all x \u2208 \u2126t1\u222at2 . (3)\nIf \u03b11 and \u03b12 are both discrete, then \u03b11 \u2297 \u03b12 is a discrete potential. If \u03b11 and \u03b12 are both continuous, then \u03b11 \u2297 \u03b12 is a continuous potential. If \u03b11 is discrete or continuous, and \u03b12 is utility, or vice-versa, then \u03b11\u2297\u03b12 is a utility potential. In all other cases, we will define the nature of the the combined potential when we define marginalization of mixed potentials.\nCombination of Mixed Potentials. Suppose \u00b51 = (\u03b11, \u03b61, \u03c51) and \u00b52 = (\u03b12, \u03b62, \u03c52) are two mixed potentials for r1 \u222a s1 \u222a t1 and r2 \u222a s2 \u222a t2, respectively, with discrete parts \u03b11 for r1, and \u03b12 for r2, respectively, continuous parts \u03b61 for s1, and \u03b62 for s2, respectively, and utility parts \u03c51 for t1, and \u03c52 for t2, respectively. Then, the combination of \u00b51 and \u00b52, denoted by \u00b51 \u2297 \u00b52, is a mixed potential for (r1 \u222a s1 \u222a t1) \u222a (r2 \u222a s2 \u222a t2) given by\n\u00b51 \u2297 \u00b52 = (\u03b11 \u2297 \u03b12, \u03b61 \u2297 \u03b62, \u03c51 \u2297 \u03c52) (4)\nSince the combination of two discrete potentials is discrete, two continuous potentials is continuous, and two utility potentials is utility, the definition in eq. (4) is consistent with the definition of mixed potentials. If \u00b51 = (\u03b1, \u03b9c, \u03b9u) is a mixed potential for r, \u00b52 = (\u03b9d, \u03b6, \u03b9u) is a mixed potential for s, and \u00b53 = (\u03b9d, \u03b9c, \u03c5) is a mixed potential for t, then \u00b51\u2297\u00b52\u2297\u00b53 = (\u03b1, \u03b6, \u03c5) is a mixed potential for r \u222a s \u222a t.\nIt is easy to confirm that combination of mixed potentials is commutative and associative. This follows from the commutativity and associativity of the combination of discrete potentials, the combination of continuous potentials, and the combination of utility potentials.\nMarginalization of Potentials. The definition of marginalization of potentials depends on the nature of the variable being marginalized. We marginalize discrete chance variables by addition over its state space, continuous chance variables by integration over its state space, and decision variables (discrete or continuous) by maximization over its state space.\nSuppose \u03b1 is a potential (discrete or continuous or utility or some combination of these) for a, and suppose X \u2208 a is a discrete variable. Then, the marginal of \u03b1 by deleting X , denoted by \u03b1\u2212X , is a potential for a \\ {X} given as follows:\n\u03b1\u2212X(y) = \u03a3{\u03b1(x,y)|x \u2208 \u2126X} for all y \u2208 \u2126a\\{X}. (5)\nIf X \u2208 a is a continuous variable, then \u03b1\u2212X is defined as follows:\n\u03b1\u2212X(y) =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03b1(x,y)dx for all y \u2208 \u2126a\\{X}. (6)\nAnd ifX \u2208 a is a decision variable, then \u03b1\u2212X is defined as follows:\n\u03b1\u2212X(y) = max{\u03b1(x,y)|x \u2208 \u2126X} for all y \u2208 \u2126a\\{X}. (7)\nIn some examples, if X is a decision variable, the state space of X may be further constrained as a function of the states of some of its information predecessors. In this case, we assume that the maximization in eq. (7) is subject to these additional constraints.\nDivision of Potentials. The definition of marginalization of mixed potentials involves division of probability (discrete or continuous) potentials by probability potentials. Also, the potential in the divisor is always a marginal of the potential being divided.\nSuppose \u03b1 is a discrete or continuous potential for a, and suppose X \u2208 a is a discrete or continuous chance variable. Then the division of \u03b1 by \u03b1\u2212X , denoted by \u03b1\u2298 \u03b1\u2212X , is a potential for a defined as follows:\n(\u03b1\u2298 \u03b1\u2212X)(x,y) = \u03b1(x,y)/\u03b1\u2212X (y) (8)\nfor all x \u2208 \u2126X , and y \u2208 \u2126a\\{X}. In eq. (8), if the denominator is zero, then the numerator is also 0, and in this case we define 0/0 as 0. The nature of the potential \u03b1 \u2298 \u03b1\u2212X depends on X . If X is discrete, \u03b1\u2298 \u03b1\u2212X is discrete, and if X is continuous, \u03b1\u2298 \u03b1\u2212X is continuous [3].\nMarginalization of Mixed Potentials. Similar to marginalization of potentials, marginalization of mixed potentials depends on the nature of the variable being marginalized. We distinguish between marginalizing a decision variable and marginalizing a chance variable from a mixed potential.\nSuppose \u00b5 = (\u03b1, \u03b6, \u03c5) is a mixed potential for r\u222a s\u222a t, where \u03b1 is a discrete potential for r, \u03b6 is a continuous potential for s, and \u03c5 is a utility potential for t. Suppose X \u2208 D and X \u2208 r\u222as\u222a t. Then the marginal of \u00b5 by deleting X , denoted by \u00b5\u2212X , is defined as follows:\n\u00b5\u2212X = \n  \n   \n(\u03b1, \u03b6, \u03c5\u2212X) if X /\u2208 r, X /\u2208 s, and X \u2208 t (\u03b9d, \u03b6, (\u03b1\u2297 \u03c5)\u2212X) if X \u2208 r, X /\u2208 s, and X \u2208 t (\u03b1, \u03b9c, (\u03b6 \u2297 \u03c5)\u2212X) if X /\u2208 r, X \u2208 s, and X \u2208 t (\u03b9d, \u03b9c, (\u03b1\u2297 \u03b6 \u2297 \u03c5)\u2212X) if X \u2208 r, X \u2208 s, and X \u2208 t\n(9)\nWe will assume that each decision variable is the domain of at least one utility potential. If so, at the time when a decision variable is to be marginalized from a mixed potential, it will always be in the domain of the utility part. Thus, we have only four cases in eq.

(10)\nSome comments about the marginalization of a chance variable from a mixed potential are as follows. In the first six cases, we have division of potentials that correspond to arc reversal in influence diagrams [15, 3]. This is necessary when we have an additive factorization of the joint utility function since multiplication and addition are not associative [17]. The last six cases in which the chance variable being marginalized doesn\u2019t belong to the domain of the utility potential is exactly as discussed in [20].\nThe divisions in the first six cases of eq. (10) can be\navoided if either there is no additive factorization of the joint utility function, i.e., there is a single utility potential in the ID representation, or if the divisor is a vacuous potential (i.e., a potential whose values are all ones). In either of these two cases, the definition of marginalization of a chance variable in eq. (10) simplifies as follows (only the cases where X \u2208 t are shown as the other cases remain unchanged):\n\u00b5\u2212X = \n \n \n(\u03b9d, \u03b9c, (\u03b1\u2297 \u03b6 \u2297 \u03c5)\u2212X) if X \u2208 r, X \u2208 s, X \u2208 t, (\u03b1, \u03b9c, (\u03b6 \u2297 \u03c5)\u2212X) if X /\u2208 r, X \u2208 s, X \u2208 t, (\u03b9d, \u03b6, (\u03b1\u2297 \u03c5)\u2212X) if X \u2208 r, X /\u2208 s, X \u2208 t.\n(11)\nSolving Hybrid Influence Diagrams. We have all the definitions needed to solve hybrid influence diagrams with deterministic variables. The solution algorithm is basically the same as described in [17, 11]. We use the Shenoy-Shafer architecture [18] to propagate the potentials in a join tree. All variables need to be marginalized in a sequence that respects the information constraints in the sense that if X precedes Y in the information sequence, then Y must be marginalized before X . Each time we marginalize a decision variable, we keep track of where the maximum is attained (as a function of the remaining variables in the potential being marginalized). This yields a decision function for the decision variable. The collection of all decision functions constitutes an optimal strategy for the influence diagram."}, {"heading": "3 Mixture of Polynomials Approximations", "text": "In this section, we describe MOP functions.

An entrepreneur has to decide on a price for his product. When the entrepreneur selects a price P , the quantity Qn that he will sell is determined from the demand curve Qn(P ). This quantity Qn will have a cost of manufacturing Cn(Qn) given by the total cost curve. The entrepreneur\u2019s profit will then be the difference between his revenue P \u00b7Qn and his cost Cn or \u03c0 = P \u00b7Qn\u2212Cn. The entrepreneur needs to find a price P that will maximize his profit.\nThis problem would be very simple if the demand curve and total cost curve were known with certainty, but this is seldom the case. We shall assume that the quantity Qn(P ) determined from the demand curve is only a nominal value and that the actual quantity sold will be Qn + Z1, where Z1 is a standard normal random variable. Furthermore, producing this quantity\nQa = Qn+Z1 will cost Ca = Cn+Z2, where Z2 is another independent standard normal random variable. Note that the profit is now \u03c0 = P \u00b7Qa \u2212 Ca.\nFor the demand curve, the functional form is Qn(p) = ln\u03b1\u2212ln p\n\u03b2 , where 0 < p \u2264 \u03b1, with parameters \u03b1 = 50, \u03b2 = 180 . For the total cost function we assume the form Cn(qa) = k0 + k1qa + k2(1\u2212 e\u2212k3qa), with parameters k0 = 700, k1 = 4, k2 = 400, k3 = 1 50 . We restrict the range of P to [1, 47] to ensure that Qa is nonnegative (with a very high probability of 0.999999). An ID representation of the problem is depicted in Figure 1.\nWe will solve the entrepreneur\u2019s problem by marginalizing variables in the following sequence: Ca, Z2, Cn, Qa, Z1, Qn, P . Z1 and Z2 are continuous variables with density potentials \u03c6(z1), \u03c6(z2), where \u03c6(\u00b7) is the PDF of the standard normal random variable. As discussed in section 2, the conditional distributions of the deterministic variables Ca, Cn, Qa, Qn are described by Dirac potentials. Since we have a single utility potential, no divisions are necessary during the solution process.\nFirst, we marginalize Ca. The Dirac potential associated with Ca is \u03c31(ca, cn, z2) = \u03b4(ca \u2212 (cn + z2)). Resulting potential \u03c01 is a utility potential.\n\u03c01(p, qa, cn, z2) = (\u03c0 \u2297 \u03c31) \u2212Ca\n=\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03b4(ca \u2212 (cn + z2)) (pqa \u2212 ca)dca\n= p \u00b7 qa \u2212 (cn + z2)\nNext, we marginalize Z2. Let \u03d56,p(z) denote the 6- piece, 3-degree MOP approximation of \u03c6(z) as described in [21]. The density potential associated with Z2 is \u03d56,p(z2). The result of marginalizing Z2 is the utility potential \u03c02 as follows.\n\u03c02(p, qa, cn) = (\u03c01 \u2297 \u03d56,p) \u2212Z2\n=\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03d56,p(z2) [p \u00b7 qa \u2212 (cn + z2)]dz2\n= p \u00b7 qa \u2212 cn\nNext we marginalize Cn. Let fCn(qa) denote the cost function 700 + 4qa + 400(1 \u2212 e\u2212 qa\n50 ). Thus, the Dirac potential associated with Cn is \u03c31(cn, qa) = \u03b4(cn \u2212 fCn(qa)). There is no closed form for the result of marginalizing chance variable Cn. Therefore, we approximate fCn(qa) by a 3-piece, 3-degree, MOP approximation, that is denoted by fpCn(qa), in the interval (2, 316) as follows:\nfpCn(qa) = \n  \n   \nTSeries[fCn(qa), qa = 54, d = 3] if 2 < qa \u2264 106 TSeries[fCn(qa), qa = 158, d = 3] if 106 < qa \u2264 201 TSeries[fCn(qa), qa = 263, d = 3] if 201 < qa < 316 0 otherwise.\n(14)\nThe notation in eq. (14), introduced in [19], means using the Taylor series expansion of fCn at a point qa, up to degree d, in the specified interval. A graph of fpCn overlaid on fCn is shown in Figure 2.\nThe result of marginalizing Cn is denoted by \u03c03, which is a utility potential in MOP form.\n\u03c03(p, qa) = (\u03c02 \u2297 \u03c33) \u2212Cn\n=\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03b4(cn \u2212 fpCn(qa)) (pqa \u2212 cn)dcn\n= p \u00b7 qa \u2212 fpCn(qa)\nNext, we marginalize Qa. The Dirac potential associated with Qa is \u03c34(qa, qn, z1) = \u03b4(qa \u2212 (qn + z1)). The result of marginalizing Qa is denoted by \u03c04, which is a utility potential in MOP form.\n\u03c04(p, qn, z1) = (\u03c03 \u2297 \u03c34) \u2212Qa\n=\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03c03(p, qa) \u03b4(qa \u2212 (qn + z1))dqa\n= p \u00b7 (qn + z1)\u2212 fpCn(qn + z1)\nNext, we marginalize Z1. The density potential for Z1 is \u03d56,p(z1). The result of marginalizing Z1 is denoted\nby \u03c05, which is a utility potential. Notice that since \u03d56,p and fpCn are MOP functions, \u03c05 is also a MOP function (46 pieces, 3 degree).\n\u03c05(p, qn) = (\u03c04 \u2297 \u03d56,p) \u2212Z1\n=\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03c04(p, qn, z1) \u03d56,p(z1)dz1\nNext, we marginalize Qn. Let fQn denote the demand function: fQn(p) = ln 50\u2212ln p\n80 , where 1 \u2264 p \u2264 47. We use a 3-piece, 3-degree MOP function fpQn to approximate fQn .\nfpQn(p) = \n   \n   \nTSeries[fQn(p), p = 4, d = 3] if 1 \u2264 p \u2264 7 TSeries[fQn(p), p = 14, d = 3] if 7 < p \u2264 21 TSeries[fQn(p), p = 34, d = 3] if 21 < p \u2264 47 0 otherwise.\nThe Dirac potential associated with Qn is \u03c35(qn, p) = \u03b4(qn \u2212 fpQn(p)). The result of marginalizing Qn is denoted by \u03c06, which is a utility potential for P in MOP form.\n\u03c06(p) = (\u03c05 \u2297 \u03c35) \u2212Qn\n= \u03c05(p, fpQn(p))\nFigure 3 shows a graph of \u03c06 vs. p. Finally, we marginalize P . The maximum profit is $194.87 at p = $24.40. For comparison, when demand and supply are known with certainty, the problem reduces to a simple nonlinear optimization problem and the maximum profit $198 is obtained when price is $24.10.
