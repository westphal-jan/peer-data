Inspired by WordNet's success, we propose as an alternative a similar resource,\nbased on the 1987 Penguin edition of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases.\nPeter Mark Roget published his first Thesaurus over 150 years ago. Countless writers, orators\nand students of the English language have used it. Computational linguists have employed\nRoget\u2019s for almost 50 years in Natural Language Processing. Some of the tasks they have used it\nfor include machine translation, computing lexical cohesion in texts and constructing databases\nthat can infer common sense knowledge. This dissertation presents Roget\u2019s merits by explaining\nwhat it really is and how it has been used, while comparing its applications to those of WordNet.\nThe NLP community has hesitated in accepting Roget\u2019s Thesaurus because a proper machine-\ntractable version was not available.\nThis dissertation presents an implementation of a machine-tractable version of the 1987 Penguin\nedition of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus \u2013 the first implementation of its kind to use an entire current\nedition. It explains the steps necessary for taking a machine-readable file and transforming it into\na tractable system. This involves converting the lexical material into a format that can be more\neasily exploited, identifying data structures and designing classes to computerize the Thesaurus.\nRoget\u2019s organization is studied in detail and contrasted with WordNet\u2019s.\nWe show two applications of the computerized Thesaurus: computing semantic similarity\nbetween words and phrases, and building lexical chains in a text. The experiments are performed\nusing well-known benchmarks and the results are compared to those of other systems that use\nRoget\u2019s, WordNet and statistical techniques. Roget\u2019s has turned out to be an excellent resource\nfor measuring semantic similarity; lexical chains are easily built but more difficult to evaluate.\nWe also explain ways in which Roget\u2019s Thesaurus and WordNet can be combined.\nTo my parents, who are my most valued treasure.\ni\nTABLE OF CONTENTS"}, {"heading": "1

He was born in London in\n1779, the son of Jean Roget, a Genevan protestant\npastor, and Catherine, the granddaughter of a French\nHuguenot who had fled to London after the revocation\nof the Edict of Nantes. Peter Mark\u2019s whole life\nprepared him to become the author of the Treasury of\nWords. This physician\u2019s preferences were anatomy\nand physiology, subjects that involve dissection and\nclassification. As expressed by Kent (Chapman, 1992, p. vii): \u201cA lifetime of secretaryships for\nseveral learned societies had thoroughly familiarized him with the need for clarity and\nforcefulness of expression. [\u2026] It was Roget\u2019s meticulous, precise way of looking at order, at\nplan and interdependence in animal economy that would eventually find expression in his unique\nand practical lexicographic experiment.\u201d As a professor, Roget prepared a notebook of lists of\nrelated words and phrases in various orders to help him express himself in the best possible way.\nKirkpatrick (Kirkpatrick, 1998, p. xi) describes the manner in which Roget prepared the\nThesaurus once he retired from professional life: \u201cNow, in his seventies, he was able to draw on\na lifetime\u2019s experience of lecturing, writing and editing to make these lists into a coherent system\navailable for others to use. It took him four years, longer than he had thought, and required all his\norganizational skills and the meticulous attention to detail that had characterized his editing\nwork. Not only did the Thesaurus utilize all Roget\u2019s competences, it also fulfilled a need for him:\nthe need, in a society changing with frightening speed, where the old moral and religious order\nwas increasingly in question, to reaffirm order, stability and unity, and through them the purpose\nof a universal, supernatural authority.\u201d Roget supervised about twenty\u2013five editions and printings of the Thesaurus until he died at the age of ninety.1\n1 Image of Peter Mark Roget: http://www.toadshow.com.au/anne/images/roget_peter.gif\nChapter 1. Introduction\n1"}, {"heading": "1 Introduction", "text": ""}, {"heading": "1.1 Lexical Resources for Natural Language Processing", "text": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications need access to vast numbers of words and\nphrases. There are now many ways of obtaining large-scale lexicons: query words on the Internet\n(Turney, 2001), use large corpora such as the Wall Street Journal or the British National Corpus,\nas well as extract information from machine-readable dictionaries (Wilks et al., 1996) or use\nelectronic lexical databases such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). Which of these methods is best?\nOur intuition presented in this dissertation is that computational linguists should extend and\ncomputerize the work of lexicographers, professionals who take concrete decisions about words,\ntheir senses and how they should be arranged. Computer programmers have been reckless in\nimagining that they can do without linguists. To investigate this conjecture I have implemented a\nlarge-scale electronic lexical knowledge base designed on the 1987 Penguin edition of Roget\u2019s\nThesaurus (Kirkpatrick, 1987).\nThe first use of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus in NLP dates back to 1957 (Masterman); WordNet, a kind of\nthesaurus, has been available since 1991. These lexical resources have been used, among others,\nfor the following applications:\n\u2022 Machine Translation\n\u2022 proposing synonyms to improve word for word translations\n\u2022 Information Retrieval\n\u2022 performing word sense disambiguation\n\u2022 expanding query terms by proposing synonyms\n\u2022 detecting the expected answer types of questions\n\u2022 Information Extraction and Text Summarization\n\u2022 measuring semantic similarity between words\n\u2022 building lexical chains\nComputational linguists have given presentations on the following subjects in two workshops\nabout WordNet organized by the Association for Computational Linguistics (Harabagiu, 1998;\nMoldovan and Peters, 2001): Information Retrieval, Language Generation, Question Answering,\nChapter 1. Introduction\n2\nText Categorization, Text Classification and Word Sense Disambiguation. Researchers displayed\ntechniques for combining WordNet and Roget\u2019s at both workshops. I discuss some of these\napplications further in Chapter 2."}, {"heading": "1.2 Electronic Lexical Knowledge Bases", "text": "Let\u2019s begin by defining the term Electronic Lexical Knowledge Base (ELKB). It is a model for a\nlexical resource, implemented in software, for classifying, indexing, storing and retrieving words\nwith their senses and the connections that exist between them. It relies on a rich data repository\nto do so. This model defines explicit semantic relationships between words and word groups. It\nmaps out an automatic process for building an electronic lexicon. It is electronic not only\nbecause it is encoded in a digital format, but rather because it is computer-usable, or tractable.\nThe process for creating an ELKB presents all the steps involved in this task: from the\npreparation and acquisition of the lexical material, to defining the allowable operations on the\nvarious words and phrases. The use of a defined systematic approach to building an ELKB\nshould reduce the irregularities usually contained in handcrafted lexicons. My thesis is a way of\nverifying this intuition.\nMy ELKB has been created from the machine readable text files with the contents of the 1987\nPenguin\u2019s Roget\u2019s Thesaurus. It must maintain the information available in the printed\nThesaurus while it is put in a tractable format. Going from readable to tractable involves\ncleaning up and re-formatting the original files, deciding what services the ELKB should offer\nand implementing those services.\n1.3 An Introduction to Roget\u2019s Thesaurus\nRoget\u2019s Thesaurus is sometimes described as a dictionary in reverse (Wilks et al., 1996, p. 65).\nAccording to Roget, it is \u201c\u2026 a collection of the words it [the English language] contains and of\nthe idiomatic combinations peculiar to it, arranged, not in alphabetical order as they are in a\nDictionary, but according to the ideas which they express\u201d (Roget, 1852). The Thesaurus is a\ncatalogue of semantically similar words and phrases, divided into nouns, verbs, adjectives,\nadverbs and interjections. A phrase in Roget\u2019s is not one in the grammatical sense, but rather a\ncollocation or an idiom, for example: fatal gift, poisoned apple, or have kissed the\nBlarney Stone. The reader perceives implicit semantic relations between groups of similar\nwords. This resembles how Miller describes WordNet as lexical information organized by word\nmeanings, rather than word forms (Miller, 1990). In WordNet, English nouns, verbs, adjectives\nand adverbs are organized into sets of near synonyms, called synsets, each representing a\nlexicalized concept. Semantic relations serve as links between the synsets.\nChapter 1. Introduction\n3\nA major strength of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus is its unique system of classification \u201cof the ideas which\nare expressible by language\u201d (Roget, 1852). The original system was organized in six classes:\nAbstract relations, Space, Material World, Intellect, Volition, Sentient and Moral Powers. Roget\ndevised this system in the following way: \u201cI have accordingly adopted such principles of\narrangement as appeared to me to be the simplest and most natural, and which would not require,\neither for their comprehension or application, any disciplined acumen, or depth of metaphysical\nor antiquarian lore\u201d (ibid.). Within these six classes are sections, and under the sections are\nalmost 1,000 heads. This system of classification has withstood the test of time remarkably well,\nhardly changing in 150 years, a tribute to the robustness of Roget\u2019s design.\nRoget\u2019s Thesaurus is the creative wordsmith\u2019s instrument, helping clarify and give shape to\none\u2019s thoughts. \u201cThe assistance it gives is that of furnishing on every topic a copious store of\nwords and phrases, adapted to express all the recognizable shades and modifications of the\ngeneral idea under which those words and phrases are arranged\u201d (ibid.). Roget\u2019s is indeed, as its\nname\u2019s Greek etymology indicates, a vast treasure house of English words and phrases.\n1.3.1 The Roget\u2019s Electronic Lexical Knowledge Base\nThe objective of this thesis is to produce a machine-tractable version of the 1987 Penguin edition\nof Roget\u2019s Thesaurus (Kirkpatrick, 1987) \u2014 the first implementation of an ELKB that uses an\nentire current edition. The FACTOTUM semantic network (Cassidy, 1996, 2000) is the first\nimplementation of a knowledge base derived from a version of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus, using the\n1911 edition that is publicly available from the Project Gutenberg Web Site (Hart, 1991). A good\nELKB should have a large, modern vocabulary, a simple way of identifying the different word\nsenses, a clear classification system, and usage frequencies, several ways of grouping words and\nphrases to represent concepts, explicit links between the various units of meaning and an index\nof all words and phrases in the resource. It should also contain a lexicon of idiomatic expressions\nand proper nouns. Definitions of the words and phrases, as well as subcategorization\ninformation, akin to what can be found in a learner\u2019s dictionary, would also be beneficial. The\nELKB constructed in the course of this research is not ideal, but it is sufficient to demonstrate\nthat Roget\u2019s is a useful and interesting resource."}, {"heading": "1.4 Goals of this Thesis", "text": "The goal of this thesis is to investigate the usefulness of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus for NLP. I expect\nthat it will be an effective alternative to WordNet. To achieve this goal, Roget\u2019s must be first\ncomputerized, evaluated and applied to some interesting tasks. The quantitative and qualitative\nChapter 1. Introduction\n4\nevaluation constantly uses WordNet 1.7.1 as a benchmark. Other more cursory comparisons are\nmade with other lexical resources.\nThis treasure of the English language is exploited to create a new resource for computational\nlinguists. The goal is to computerize the Thesaurus: create a machine-tractable lexical\nknowledge base, and represent in it the explicit, and some of the implicit, relationships between\nwords. I have performed experiments using the system for measuring the semantic similarity\nbetween words and building lexical chains. This dissertation also presents steps for combining\nRoget\u2019s and WordNet."}, {"heading": "1.5 Organization of the Thesis", "text": "Chapter 2 of the thesis gives an overview of the role of thesauri in NLP, discussing how such\nresources benefit research.

It explains all of\nthe necessary steps for transforming the Roget\u2019s text files into a machine tractable format. These\nsteps discuss the necessary functionality of such a system.

Much research activity focused on automatic knowledge extraction from\nMRDs to construct large knowledge bases. Thesauri using controlled vocabularies, for example\nthe Medical Subject Headings thesaurus (Medical Subject Headings, 1983), the Educational\nResources Information Centre thesaurus (Houston, 1984) and the IEE Inspec thesaurus which\ncontains technical literature in domains related to engineering (Inspec Thesaurus, 1985), have\nproven effective in information retrieval (Lesk, 1995).

Yet this\nresource must be studied carefully before an ELKB can be devised."}, {"heading": "2.2.1 The Many Versions of Roget\u2019s", "text": "The name \u201cRoget\u2019s\u201d has become synonymous with the Thesaurus, yet most thesauri are not\nbased on the original classification system. Roget published the first edition of his Thesaurus of\nChapter 2. The Use of Thesauri in Natural Language Processing\n8\nEnglish Words and Phrases in May 1852. Already by 1854, Reverend B. Sears had copied it in\nthe United States, removing all of the phrases and placing all words and expressions borrowed\nfrom a foreign language in an Appendix (Kirkpatrick, 1998). Today, a quick search for Roget\u2019s\nThesaurus at Amazon.com reveals well over 100 results with such titles as Roget's 21st Century\nThesaurus, Roget International Thesaurus, Roget's II: The New Thesaurus, Roget's Children's\nThesaurus, Bartlett's Roget's Thesaurus, Roget's Super Thesaurus and Roget's Thesaurus of the\nBible. Thesauri are now commonplace in written reference libraries or electronic formats, found\non the Internet (Lexico, 2001), in word processors or prepared for NLP research like the ELKB.\nWhich thesaurus is the best? A study of the publishers\u2019 descriptions of their works suggests that\nthere are many excellent thesauri. The introduction to Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus describes\nit as \u201ca more efficient word-finder because it has a structure especially designed to stimulate\nthought and help you organize your ideas\u201d (Chapman, 1992). Roget\u2019s II: The New Thesaurus\ngives itself a clear mandate as \u201ca book devoted entirely to meaning\u201d (Master, 1995). Penguin\u2019s\n1998 edition of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases (Kirkpatrick) is the present day\nthesaurus most similar to the original: \u201cThe unique classification system which was devised by\nPeter Mark Roget and is described fully in the Introduction, has withstood the test of time\nremarkably well. \u2026 it is eminently capable of absorbing new concepts and vocabulary and of\nreflecting what is happening in the English language as time goes by.\u201d\nThe various thesauri boast anywhere from 200,000 to 300,000 words but size alone is not what\nmatters. Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus (Chapman, 1992) lists close to 180 different kinds of\ntrees from the acacia to the zebrawood. This enumeration is not nearly enough to be exhaustive,\nnor does it really help to describe all aspects of the concept 310 Plants. If the size of a\nthesaurus determined a \u201cwinner\u201d, one could simply publish a list of plants, animals, and so on.\nThis thesis demonstrates that the classification system of the 1987 edition of Penguin\u2019s Roget\u2019s\nThesaurus is its great strength. It is interesting to note that Roget\u2019s source of inspiration for the\nThesaurus indeed was plant taxonomy, so it is much more than a mere catalogue. Every word or\nphrase is carefully placed in the hierarchy. While a good thesaurus must contain many words, it\nshould above all classify them methodically, according to the ideas which they express.\n2.2.2 A Comparison of Potential Candidates for Building an ELKB\nIn this sea of thesauri, only four candidates remain as contenders for building an electronic\nlexical knowledge base: the 1911 Project Gutenberg (Hart, 1991) edition, Patrick Cassidy\u2019s\nFACTOTUM semantic network (Cassidy, 1996, 2000), HarperCollins\u2019 Roget\u2019s International\nThesaurus and Penguin\u2019s Roget\u2019s Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases. The first two\nresources are electronic versions of an early Roget\u2019s Thesaurus, the latter two printed versions.\nChapter 2. The Use of Thesauri in Natural Language Processing\n9\nThe 1911 Project Gutenberg (Hart, 1991) edition is a text file derived from the 1911 version of\nRoget's Thesaurus. MICRA, INC. prepared it in May 1991. This is a public domain version of\nthe Thesaurus. This version consists of six classes, 1035 major subject headings and roughly\n41,000 words, 1,000 of them added by MICRA Inc. The original classification system has been\npreserved. This 1911 version is the foundation for FACTOTUM, which is described as a\nsemantic network organized very similarly to Roget\u2019s but with a more explicit hierarchy and 400\nsemantic relations that link the individual words to one of the 1035 heads (Cassidy, 2000)\nThe fifth edition of Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus is \u201cthe most up-to-date and definitive\nthesaurus\u201d according to its editor, Robert L. Chapman (1992). It consists of fifteen classes, 1073\nheadwords and more than 325,000 words. Previous printed editions of Roget\u2019s International\nThesaurus have been successfully used in NLP for word sense disambiguation, information\nretrieval and computing lexical cohesion in texts. We present examples of such experiments in\nsection 2.3.1. As far as we know, no electronic versions of Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus have\nbeen made available to the public at large.\nPenguin\u2019s Roget\u2019s Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases, edited by Betty Kirkpatrick (1998)\nis \u201ca vast treasure-house according to ideas and meanings\u201d as advertised by Penguin Books. It consists of six classes, 990 headwords and more than 250,000 words. It is has maintained a\nclassification system similar to that of the original edition, and the vocabulary has been updated to reflect the changes since the mid-19th century.\nTwo criteria for choosing the starting point for the electronic lexical knowledge base stand out:\nan extensive and up-to-date vocabulary and a classification system very similar to that of the original Thesaurus. The constraint on the classification system allows investigating how well it\nhas stood the test of time. Only the 1911 version and the Penguin edition have kept the original\nclassification system, but the latter is more complete. For this reasons I have chosen Roget\u2019s\nThesaurus of English Words and Phrases as the foundation of my electronic lexical knowledge\nbase.\n2.3 NLP Applications of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus and WordNet\nIt is commonly accepted that a lexical resource should not be prepared if there is no specific task\nfor it. I have developed what is often referred to as a \u201cvanilla flavor\u201d lexicon \u2013 a resource that\nhas a broad, general coverage of the English language (Wilks et al., 1996). The fear in creating\nsuch a lexical resource is that by trying to be suitable for all applications, it ends up being useful\nfor none. WordNet is also such an instrument and it has proven to be invaluable to the NLP\ncommunity.\nChapter 2. The Use of Thesauri in Natural Language Processing\n10\nBoth Roget\u2019s Thesaurus and WordNet were not initially intended for NLP. The first was planned\nfor writers and orators, for those who are \u201cpainfully groping their way and struggling with the\ndifficulties of composition\u201d (Kirkpatrick, 1998), the latter as a model for psycholinguists,\ndevised as \u201can on-line representation of a major part of the English lexicon that aims to be\npsychologically realistic\u201d (Beckwith et al., 1991). Like penicillin, WordNet is now considered a\npanacea. Roget\u2019s Thesaurus, whose potential I intend to demonstrate, should become equally\neffective. The following sections describe how both resources have been used in NLP.\n2.3.1 Using Roget\u2019s Thesaurus in NLP\nRoget\u2019s Thesaurus has been used sporadically in NLP since about 1950 when it was first put into\na machine-readable form (Masterman, 1957). The most notable applications include machine\ntranslation (Masterman, 1957, Sparck Jones, 1964), information retrieval (Driscoll, 1992,\nMandala et al., 1999), computing lexical cohesion in texts (Morris and Hirst, 1991) and word\nsense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1992).\nMasterman (ibid.) used a version on punched cards to improve word-for-word machine\ntranslation. She demonstrated how the Thesaurus could improve an initially unsatisfactory\ntranslation. As an example, Masterman explains that the Italian phrase \u201ctale problema si\npresenta particolarmente interressante\u201d, translated word-for-word as \u201csuch problems\nself-present particularly interesting\u201d, can be retranslated as \u201csuch problems strike\none as, [or prove] particularly interesting\u201d. The essence of this \u201cthesaurus\nprocedure\u201d is to build, for every significant word of the initial translation, a list of Heads under\nwhich they appear, and to look for intersections between these lists. Replacements for\ninaccurately translated words or phrases are selected from the Head that contains the most words\nfrom the initial translation. Alternatives can be manually selected by choosing a better word from\nthis Head. Masterman notes that the sense of a word, as used in a sentence, can be uniquely\nidentified by knowing to which Head this sense belongs.\nSparck Jones (1964) realized that the Thesaurus in its present form had to be improved for it to\nbe effective for machine translation. She therefore set out to create the ideal machine translation\ndictionary that \u201c\u2026 has to be a dictionary in the ordinary sense: it must give definitions or\ndescriptions of the meanings of words. It must also, however, give some indication of the kinds\nof contexts in which the words are used, that is, must be a \u2018semantic classification\u2019 as well as a\ndictionary\u201d (ibid.). Sparck Jones believed that by classifying dictionary definitions using Roget\u2019s\nHeads she could construct the resource that she required.\nChapter 2. The Use of Thesauri in Natural Language Processing\n11\nUnder Roget\u2019s headwords there are groups of closely semantically related words, located in the\nsame paragraph and separated by semicolons. Sparck Jones (1964) built \u201crows\u201d consisting of\nclose semi-synonyms, using the Oxford English Dictionary. She then attempted to classify the\nrows according to the common membership in headwords. Here are some rows that have been\nclassified as belonging to the Head activity:\nactivity animation activity liveliness animation activity animation movement activity action work activity energy vigour\nSparck Jones later used these techniques for information retrieval. Other people (Driscoll, 1992\nand Mandala et al., 1999) have also used the Thesaurus for this purpose, but this time to expand\nthe initial queries.\nHalliday and Hasan (1976) explain that a cohesive text is identified by the presence of strong\nsemantic relations between the words that it is made up of. Morris and Hirst (1991) calculated\nlexical cohesion, which they call \u201cthe result of chains of related words that contribute to the\ncontinuity of lexical meaning\u201d within texts. The fourth edition of Roget\u2019s International\nThesaurus (Chapman, 1977) was used to compute manually lexical chains, which are indicators\nof lexical cohesion. Stairmand (1994) automated this process using the 1911 edition of Roget\u2019s\nThesaurus but did not obtain good results, as this version of the Thesaurus contains limited and\nantiquated vocabulary. Ellman (2000) once again used the 1911 edition to build lexical chains so\nas to construct a representation of a text\u2019s meaning from its content. An implementation of a\nlexical chain building system that uses the ELKB is presented in Chapter 5.\nWord sense disambiguation must be the most popular use of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus in NLP.\nYarowsky (1992) defines the sense of a word as \u201cthe categories listed for that word in Roget\u2019s\nInternational Thesaurus\u201d The 1000 headwords allow to partition the major senses of a word\nquite accurately. To perform sense disambiguation, one must determine under which headword\nthe given sense belongs. This can be determined by using the context of a polysemous word and\nthe words of a given class. Other people who have used Roget\u2019s for word sense disambiguation\ninclude Bryan (1973, 1974), Patrick (1985), Sedelow and Mooney (1988), Kwong (2001b).\nRoget\u2019s Thesaurus has also been used to measure semantic similarity with extremely good\ncorrelation with human judgments. It was first accomplished by McHale (1998) using the\ntaxonomy of Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus, third edition (Berrey and Carruth, 1962). Another\nimplementation, using the ELKB, is discussed in Chapter 4.\nChapter 2. The Use of Thesauri in Natural Language Processing\n12\nScientists have also attempted to build databases that can infer common sense knowledge, for\nexample that \u201cblind men cannot see\u201d, using Roget\u2019s. Some implementations include Cassidy\u2019s\nFACTOTUM semantic network (Cassidy, 2000) and the work of Sedelow and Sedelow (1992).\n2.3.2 Using WordNet in NLP\nGeorge Miller first thought of WordNet in the mid-1960s. The WordNet project started in 1985\nand seven different versions have been released since version 1.0 in June of 1991 (Miller,\n1998a). Although it is an electronic lexical database based on psycholinguistic principles, it has\nbeen used almost exclusively in NLP. For numerous research groups around the world it is now a\ngeneric resource. A tribute to its success are the Coling-ACL \u201998 workshop entitled Usage of\nWordNet in Natural Language Processing Systems (Harabagiu, 1998), the NAACL 2001 WordNet and Other Lexical Resources workshop (Moldovan and Peters, 2001), the 1st\nInternational WordNet Conference (Fellbaum, 2002) and the close to 300 references in the\nWordNet Bibliography (Mihalcea, 2003). Some of the issues discussed at the WordNet\nworkshops and conference include determining for which applications WordNet is a valuable\nresource, evaluating if WordNet can be used to develop high performance word sense\ndisambiguation algorithms and extending WordNet for specific tasks. The semantic relations in\nWordNet have often been studied, even exploited for a variety of applications, for example\nmeasuring semantic similarity (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001), and encoding models for answers\ntypes in open-domain question answering systems (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001). Using WordNet\nas a blueprint, various multilingual lexical databases have been implemented, the first one being\nEuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998), a multilingual electronic lexical database for Dutch, Italian,\nSpanish, German, French and Estonian.\nDue to the limitations of the printed version of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus, many researchers have opted\nfor WordNet when attempting to extend their algorithms beyond toy problems. Systems that\nperform word sense disambiguation have been implemented using this electronic lexical\ndatabase (Sussna, 1993; Okumura and Honda, 1994; Li et al., 1995; Mihalcea and Moldovan,\n1998; Kwong, 2001b; Fellbaum et al.2001). WordNet\u2019s taxonomy has been exploited to measure\nsemantic similarity \u2013 for a survey of these metrics see (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001). Lexical\nchains (Morris and Hirst, 1991) were first built by hand using Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus.\nHirst and St-Onge (1998) later implemented them using WordNet. Lexical chains built using\nWordNet have been applied in text summarization by Barzilay and Elhadad (1997), Brunn et al.\n(2001) as well as Silber and McCoy (2000, 2002). It is impossible to evaluate how many people\nwho have used WordNet would have used Roget\u2019s Thesaurus were it in a machine-tractable form\nand free.\nChapter 2. The Use of Thesauri in Natural Language Processing\n13\n2.3.3 Combining Roget\u2019s Thesaurus and WordNet in NLP\nA current trend in NLP is towards combining lexical resources to attempt to overcome their\nindividual weaknesses. Roget\u2019s taxonomy has been used to compute the semantic similarity\nbetween words and the results have been compared to those of the same experiments using\nWordNet (Mc Hale, 1998). Although the two resources were not actually combined, and it is not\nclear which system produces better results, it is an interesting investigation, which reiterates the\nfact that both can be used for the same applications. This experiment is repeated in Chapter 4\nusing the ELKB. Others have attempted to enrich WordNet with Roget\u2019s Thesaurus to\nsupplement the lack of relations between part of speech and proper nouns by those available in\nthe Thesaurus (Mandala et al., 1999). Kwong (1998, 2001a) presents an algorithm for aligning\nthe word senses of the nouns in the 1987 edition of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus of English Words and\nPhrases an those in WordNet 1.6. A limited number of noun senses has been mapped. Nastase\nand Szpakowicz (2001) perform a similar experiment on a smaller set of words but use a larger\nset of parts-of-speech: nouns, adjectives and adverbs. An implementation of the mapping of\nword senses in the ELKB and WordNet 1.7 is discussed in Chapter 6. This is of importance, since\nas Kwong states (1998): \u201cIn general we cannot expect that a single resource will be sufficient for\nany NLP applications. WordNet is no exception, but we can nevertheless enhance its utility\u201d. The\nanalogy can be drawn with Roget\u2019s: alone it cannot serve all tasks; combined with WordNet the\nThesaurus will be enriched.\n2.4 Roget\u2019s Thesaurus as a Resource for NLP"}, {"heading": "2.4.1 Why Have People Used Roget\u2019s for NLP?", "text": "This chapter has presented examples of NLP applications that used Roget\u2019s Thesaurus. What\nwere the incentives? The structure based on the hierarchy of categories is very simple to\ncomputerize and use, as was demonstrated by Masterman (1957) and Sparck Jones (1964). No\n\u201creverse engineering\u201d is required to access this lattice of concepts, as it would have to be if one\nwere building it from a dictionary. Roget\u2019s has a long established tradition and is believed to be\nthe best thesaurus. It is, however, not machine tractable in the way WordNet is. To quote McHale\n(1998): \u201cRoget\u2019s remains, though, an attractive lexical resource for those with access to it. Its\nwide, shallow hierarchy is densely populated with nearly 200,000 words and phrases. The\nrelationships among the words are also much richer than WordNet\u2019s IS-A or HAS-PART links.\nThe price paid for this richness is a somewhat unwieldy tool with ambiguous links\u201d. Indeed, the\nextreme difficulty of exploiting implicit semantic relations is one of the reasons why the\nThesaurus has been considered but discarded by many researchers.\nChapter 2. The Use of Thesauri in Natural Language Processing\n14"}, {"heading": "2.4.2 Why Do People Not Use Roget\u2019s More for NLP?", "text": "It is difficult for a computer to use a resource prepared for humans. WordNet is simply easier to\nuse, as explained by Hirst and St-Onge (1995): \u201cMorris and Hirst were never able to implement\ntheir algorithm for finding lexical chains with Roget\u2019s because no on-line copy of the thesaurus\nwas available to them. However, the subsequent development of WordNet raises the possibility\nthat, with a suitable modification of the algorithm, WordNet could be used in place of Roget\u2019s\u201d.\nAn electronic version of the 1911 edition of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus has been available since 1991.\nThis edition also proves inadequate for NLP, as Hirst and St-Onge (1995) describe: \u201cRecent\neditions of Roget\u2019s could not be licensed. The on-line version of the 1911 edition was available,\nbut it does not include the index that is crucial to the algorithm. Moreover, because of its age, it\nlacks much of the vocabulary necessary for processing many contemporary texts, especially\nnewspaper and magazine articles and technical papers.\u201d Stairmand (1994) confirmed that it is not\npossible to implement a lexical chainer using the on-line 1911 version.\nThe literature shows that only Penguin\u2019s Roget\u2019s Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases,\nHarperCollins\u2019 Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus as well as the 1911 edition have been used for\nNLP research. Choosing the concept hierarchy of one or the other does not ensure a definitive\nadvantage, as Yarowsky (1992) states: \u201cNote that this edition of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus [Chapman,\n1977] is much more extensive than the 1911 version, though somewhat more difficult to obtain\nin electronic form. One could use other concept hierarchies, such as WordNet (Miller, 1990) or\nthe LDOCE subject codes (Slator, 1992). All that is necessary is a set of semantic categories and\na list of the words in each category.\u201d Roget\u2019s is more than a concept hierarchy, but the elements\nthat are most easily accessed using a printed version are the classification system and the index.\nFor this reason, computational linguists have limited their experiments to computerizing and\nmanipulating the index.\nThe availability of the lexical material of a current edition of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus is the major\nhindrance for using this resource in NLP. The publishers of Roget\u2019s do not make it easy to obtain\nan electronic copy.\n2.4.3 A Machine-tractable Version of Roget\u2019s extended With WordNet Relations\nRoget\u2019s Thesaurus has many undeniable advantages. It is based on a well-constructed concept\nclassification, and its entries were written by professional lexicographers. It contains around\n250,000 words compared to WordNet\u2019s almost 200,000. Roget\u2019s employs a rich set of semantic\nrelations, most of them implicit (Cassidy, 2000). These relationships are one of the most\ninteresting qualities. Morris and Hirst (1991) say: \u201cA thesaurus simply groups related words\nChapter 2. The Use of Thesauri in Natural Language Processing\n15\nwithout attempting to explicitly name each relationship. In a traditional computer database, a\nsystematic semantic relationship can be represented by a slot value for a frame, or by a named\nlink in a semantic network. If it is hard to classify a relationship in a systematic semantic way, it\nwill be hard to represent the relationship in a traditional frame or semantic network formalism\u201d.\nA machine-tractable thesaurus will possibly present a better way of organizing semantic\nrelations, although the challenge will be to label them explicitly.\nRoget\u2019s Thesaurus does not have some of WordNet\u2019s shortcomings, such as the lack of links\nbetween parts of speech and the absence of topical groupings. The clusters of closely related\nwords are obviously not the same in both resources. WordNet relies on a set of about 15 semantic\nrelations, which I present in Chapter 3. Search in this lexical database requires a word and a\nsemantic relation; for every word some (but never all) of 15 relations can be used in search. It is\nimpossible to express a relationship that involves more than one of the 15 relations: it cannot be\nstored in WordNet. The Thesaurus can link the noun bank, the business that provides financial\nservices, and the verb invest, to give money to a bank to get a profit, as used in the following\nsentences, by placing them in a common head 784 Lending.\n1. Mary went to the bank yesterday.\n2. She invested $5,000.00 in mutual funds.\nThis notion cannot be described using WordNet\u2019s semantic relations. While an English speaker\ncan identify a relation not provided by WordNet, for example that one invests money in a bank,\nthis is not sufficient for a computer system. The main challenge is to label such relations\nexplicitly. I expect to be able to identify a good number of implicit semantic relations in Roget\u2019s\nby combining it with WordNet .This process is described in Chapter 6.\nWordNet was built using different linguistic sources. They include the Brown Corpus (Francis\nand Kucera, 1982), the Basic Book of Synonyms and Antonyms (Urdang, 1978a), The Synonym Finder (Urdang, 1978b), the 4th edition of Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus (Chapman, 1977) and\nRalph Grishman\u2019s COMLEX (Macleod, et al., 1994). Many of the lexical files were written by\ngraduate students hired part-time. Penguin\u2019s Roget\u2019s Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases is\nprepared by professional lexicographers and validated using data from the Longman Corpus\nNetwork of many millions words. The carefully prepared Thesaurus is therefore more consistent\nthan WordNet as is shown by comparing the soldier paragraph in the Thesaurus Head 722\nCombattant. Army. Navy. Air Force and the kinds of soldier listed in WordNet 1.7.1.\nChapter 2. The Use of Thesauri in Natural Language Processing\n16\nThe Roget\u2019s paragraph does not contain any proper nouns, which at first may seem as a\nweakness compared to WordNet, but is the most rational decision for such a lexical resource, as\nWordNet\u2019s list contains but an infinitely small number of the world\u2019s great soldiers. Although\nWordNet lists Allen, Bayard, Borgia, Higginson, Kosciusko, Lafayette, Lawrence, Lee,\nMohamed Ali, Morgan, Percy, Peron, Smuts and Tancred other arguably even greater, such as\nChapter 2. The Use of Thesauri in Natural Language Processing\n17\nAlexander, Caesar, Charlemagne, Timur, Genghis Khan, Napoleon, Nelson are absent. This\nexample is not sufficient to prove that the Thesaurus is a more carefully crafted resource than\nWordNet, but is enough to indicate that Roget\u2019s is a very good foundation for an electronic\nlexical knowledge base and that WordNet is not perfect. Extending Roget\u2019s with WordNet can\nonly make it better, as the combined information makes for a richer semantic network. Although\nWordNet has become the de facto standard electronic lexical knowledge base for NLP, there is\nno reason why it should be the only one. The ELKB is built from Roget\u2019s Thesaurus and can be\ncombined with WordNet. This results in an interesting alternative for solving NLP problems."}, {"heading": "2.5 The Evaluation of a Thesaurus Designed for NLP", "text": "The evaluation of the ELKB must be functional, quantitative and qualitative. It is functional in\nthe sense that the ELKB must allow the same manipulations as the printed Thesaurus: word and\nphrase lookup, browsing via the hierarchy, random browsing and following links. Experiments\nthat have been previously done by hand, for example calculating the distance between words or\nphrases by counting their relative separation in Roget\u2019s, must be automated. Chapter 3 presents\nthe various use scenarios and discusses how they are implemented in the ELKB. The evaluation\nis quantitative in the sense that the ELKB should have a comparable number of word senses as\nWordNet. This evaluation is performed in Chapter 3. It finally is qualitative in the sense that the\nwords and phrases contained in Roget\u2019s should perform a wide variety of NLP applications. The\nThesaurus is put to the test by calculating semantic similarity between words and phrases,\nexplained in Chapter 4, and in the task of building lexical chains, described in Chapter 5. The\nexperiments involving mapping Roget\u2019s senses onto WordNet senses in Chapter 6 expose the\ndifferences in lexical material between both resources.\nChapter 3. The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\n18\n3 The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\nThe preliminary step in evaluating the usefulness of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus for NLP is the\nimplementation of the ELKB. This chapter describes the steps involved in computerizing the\nThesaurus, from the details of how this resource is organized, to a Java implementation of the\nELKB. I explain Roget\u2019s structure, behavior and function as well as present the way in which the\nELKB works. This chapter shows the steps involved in transforming the source material into a\nformat that is adequate for further processing, and discusses the required data structures for the\nsystem. It finally illustrates some scenarios of how the ELKB is to be used. I perform a\ncomparison to WordNet, the de facto standard for electronic lexical databases, at the various\nstages of the design and implementation of this electronic resource.\n3.1 General organization of Roget\u2019s and WordNet\nOntologies have been used in Artificial Intelligence since the 1950s. Researchers agree that they\nare extremely useful for a wide variety of applications but do not agree on their contents and\nstructure (Lehmann, 1995). Roget proposed a classification system that is essentially a taxonomy\nof ideas that can be expressed in the English language. His system has a very Victorian bias to it,\nbut this thesis demonstrates that it is useful to modern day researchers nonetheless. Let\u2019s\nexamine its properties and compare it to the ontology of nouns implicitly present in WordNet.\nRoget\u2019s ontology is headed by six Classes. The first three Classes cover the external world:\nAbstract Relations deals with such ideas as number, order and time; Space is concerned with\nmovement, shapes and sizes, while Matter covers the physical world and humankind\u2019s\nperception of it by means of five senses. The remaining Classes deal with the internal world of\nhuman beings: the mind (Intellect), the will (Volition), the heart and soul (Emotion, Religion and\nMorality). There is a logical progression from abstract concepts, through the material universe, to\nmankind itself, culminating in what Roget saw as mankind\u2019s highest achievements: morality and\nreligion (Kirkpatrick, 1998). Class Four, Intellect, is divided into Formation of ideas and\nCommunication of ideas, and Class Five, Volition, into Individual volition and Social volition. In\npractice, therefore, the Thesaurus is headed by eight Classes. This is the structure that has been\nadopted for the ELKB.\nA path in Roget\u2019s ontology always begins with one of the Classes. It branches to one of the 39\nSections, then to one of the 79 Sub-Sections, then to one of the 596 Head Groups and finally to\none of the 990 Heads. Each Head is divided into paragraphs grouped by parts of speech: nouns,\nadjectives, verbs and adverbs. According to Kirkpatrick (1998) \u201cNot all Heads have a full\nChapter 3. The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\n19\ncomplement of parts of speech, nor are the labels themselves applied too strictly, words and\nphrases being allocated to the part-of-speech which most closely describes their function\u201d. Much\nis left to the lexicographers\u2019 intuitions, which makes it hard to use Roget\u2019s as it is for NLP\napplications. Finally a paragraph is divided into semicolon groups of semantically closely related\nwords. These paths create a graph in the Thesaurus since they are interconnected at various\npoints. An example of a Head in Roget\u2019s is 864 Wonder. I show it here with the first paragraph\nfor every part-of-speech as well as its path in the ontology:\nClass six: Emotion, religion and morality\nSection two: Personal emotion\nSub-section: Contemplative\nHead Group: 864 Wonder \u2013 865 Lack of wonder\nHead: 864 Wonder\nN. wonder, state of wonder, wonderment, raptness; admiration, hero worship, 887 love; awe, fascination; cry of wonder, gasp of admiration, whistle, wolf wolf, exclamation, exclamation mark; shocked silence, 399 silence; open mouth, popping eyes, eyes on stalks; shock, surprise, surprisal, 508 lack of expectation; astonishment, astoundment, amazement; stupor, stupefaction; bewilderment, bafflement, 474 uncertainty; consternation, 854 fear.\n\u2026\nAdj. wondering, marvelling, admiring, etc. vb.; awed, awestruck, fascinated, spellbound, 818 impressed; surprised, 508 inexpectant; astonished, amazed, astounded; in wonderment, rapt, lost in wonder, lost in amazement, unable to believe one's eyes or senses; wide-eyed, round-eyed, pop-eyed, with one's eyes starting out of one's head, with eyes on stalks; open-mouthed, agape, gaping; dazzled, blinded; dumbfounded, dumb, struck dumb, inarticulate, speechless, breathless, wordless, left without words, silenced, 399 silent; bowled over, struck all of a heap, thunderstruck; transfixed, rooted to the spot; dazed, stupefied, bewildered, 517 puzzled; aghast, flabbergasted; shocked, scandalized, 924 disapproving.\n\u2026\nVb. wonder, marvel, admire, whistle; hold one's breath, gasp, gasp with admiration; hero-worship, 887 love; stare, gaze and gaze, goggle at, gawk, open one's eyes wide, rub one's eyes, not believe one's eyes; gape, gawp, open one's mouth, stand in amazement, look aghast, 508 not expect; be awestruck, be overwhelmed, 854 fear; have no words to express, not know what to say, be reduced to silence, be struck dumb, 399 be silent.\nChapter 3. The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\n20\nMiller took a different approach to constructing an ontology for WordNet. Only nouns are clearly\norganized into a hierarchy. Adjectives, verbs and adverbs are organized individually into various\nwebs that are difficult to untangle. This decision has been based on pragmatic reasons more than\non theories of lexical semantics, as Miller (1998b) admits: \u201cPartitioning the nouns has one\nimportant practical advantage: it reduces the size of the files that lexicographers must work with\nand makes it possible to assign the writing and editing of the different files to different people.\u201d\nIndeed, organizing WordNet\u2019s more than 100,000 nouns must have required a fair amount of\nplanning.\nIn WordNet version 1.7.1 noun hierarchies are organized around nine unique beginners. A\nunique beginner is a synset which is found at the top of the noun ontology. Most synsets are\naccompanied with a gloss which is a short definition of the synonym set. The following are the\nunique beginners:\nentity, physical thing (that which is perceived or known or inferred to have its own physical existence (living or nonliving)) psychological feature, (a feature of the mental life of a living organism) abstraction, (a general concept formed by extracting common features from specific examples) state, (the way something is with respect to its main attributes; \"the current state of knowledge\"; \"his state of health\"; \"in a weak financial state\") event, (something that happens at a given place and time) act, human action, human activity, (something that people do or cause to happen) group, grouping, (any number of entities (members) considered as a unit) possession, (anything owned or possessed) phenomenon, (any state or process known through the senses rather than by intuition or reasoning)\nFigure 3.2: The WordNet 1.7.1 unique beginners.\nChapter 3. The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\n21\nAll of the other nouns can eventually be traced back to these nine synsets. If these are considered\nanalogous to Roget\u2019s Classes, the next level of nouns can be considered as the Sections. In all,\nthe unique beginners have 161 noun synsets directly linked to them (Appendix M). The number\nof nouns that are two levels away from the top of the noun hierarchies have not been identified,\nbut if even a quarter of the WordNet nouns can be found here, they would represent close to\n37,000 words.\nMiller (1998b) mentions that WordNet\u2019s noun ontology is relatively shallow in the sense that it\nseems to have a limited number of levels of specialization. In theory, of course, there is no limit\nto the number of levels an inheritance system can have. Lexical inheritance systems, however,\nseldom go more than 10 or 12 levels deep, and the deepest examples usually contain technical\ndistinctions that are not part of the everyday vocabulary. For example, a Shetland pony is a pony,\na horse, an equid, an odd-toe ungulate, a placental mammal, a mammal, a vertebrate, a chordate,\nan animal, an organism, an object and an entity: 13 levels, half of them technical (ibid.).\nThe IS-A relations connect WordNet\u2019s noun hierarchy in a vertical fashion, whereas the IS-\nPART, IS-SUBSTANCE, IS-MEMBER and the HAS-PART, HAS-SUBSTANCE, HAS-\nMEMBER relations allow for horizontal connections. This allows interconnecting various word\nnets, represented by the synsets, into a large web.\nA simple quantitative comparison of the two ontologies is difficult. Roget (1852) claims that\norganizing words hierarchically is very useful: \u201cIn constructing the following system of\nclassification of the ideas which are expressible by language, my chief aim has been to obtain the\ngreatest amount of practical utility.\u201d Miller, on the other hand, feels that it is basically impossible\nto create a hierarchy for all words, since: \u201cthese abstract generic concepts [which make up the\ntop levels of the ontology] carry so little semantic information; it is doubtful that people could\nagree on appropriate words to express them.\u201d (1998b) The Tabular synopsis of categories, which\nrepresents the concept hierarchy, is presented at the beginning of the Thesaurus. On the other\nhand, in WordNet only the unique beginners are listed, and only in the documentation. This\nshows that much more value was attributed to the ontology in Roget\u2019s. Tables 3.1 and 3.2 show\nthe portions of Roget\u2019s and WordNet\u2019s ontologies that classify the various abstract relations.\nBoth tables use the Class, Section and Head notation from Roget\u2019s Thesaurus. The Section Time\nhas been expanded to present the underlying Heads. The glosses that accompany each WordNet\nnoun synset are not included in the table so as to compare them to semicolon groups, for which\nthe Thesaurus does not give definitions.\nChapter 3. The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\n22\nClass One: Abstract Relations\nThe Heads in the printed Roget\u2019s Thesaurus are placed in two distinct columns to express\nopposing ideas such as 128 Morning and 129 Evening. Sometimes there is an intermediate\nidea, for example:\n132 Young person 133 Old person 134 Adultness\nThe visual representation of the hypernym tree for WordNet\u2019s Time Section has been chosen so\nas to facilitate the comparison with Roget\u2019s. The order of the synsets in the table is the one given\nby WordNet. There does not seem to be as clear an underlying structure as the one presented by\nthe Thesaurus.\nChapter 3. The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\n23\nUnique Beginner Three: Abstraction\n3.2 The Counts of Words and Phrases in Roget\u2019s and WordNet\nThe simplest way to compare Roget\u2019s Thesaurus and WordNet is to count strings. Table 3.3\nshows the word and phrase counts for the 1987 Roget\u2019s, divided among parts of speech. A sense\nis defined as the occurrence of a word or phrase within a unique semicolon group, for example\nthe slope in {rising ground, rise, bank, ben, brae, slope, climb, incline}. Table\n3.4 presents the different counts for WordNet 1.7.1 and the strings in common with Roget\u2019s. Here\na sense is the occurrence of a string within a unique synset, for example slope in {slope,\nincline, side}.\nThe absolute sizes are similar. The surprisingly low 32% overlap may be due to the fact that\nWordNet\u2019s vocabulary dates to 1990, while Roget\u2019s contains a vocabulary that spans 150 years,\nsince many words have been added to the original 1852 edition, but few have been removed. It is\nalso rich in idioms: \u201cThe present Work is intended to supply, with respect to the English\nlanguage, a desideratum hitherto unsupplied in any language; namely a collection of words it\nChapter 3. The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\n24\ncontains and of the idiomatic combinations peculiar to it \u2026\u201d (Roget, 1852). Fellbaum (1998b)\nadmits that WordNet contains little figurative language. She explains that idioms must appear in\nan ELKB if it is to serve NLP applications that deal with real texts where idiomatic language is\npervasive.\nPOS Unique Strings Paragraphs Semicolon Groups\nSenses\nNoun 56307 2876 31133 114052\nVerb 24724 1497 13968 55647\nAdjective 21665 1500 12889 48712\nAdverb 4140 498 1822 5708\nInterjection 372 61 65 406\nTotals 107208 6432 59877 224525\n3.3 The semantic relations of Roget\u2019s and WordNet\nCassidy (2000) has identified 400 kinds of semantic relations in the FACTOTUM semantic\nnetwork which is based on the 1911 edition of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus. This suggests that the 1987\nPenguin edition of Roget\u2019s has a rich set of implicit semantic relations. To build a useful\nelectronic lexical knowledge base from the Thesaurus, these relations must be made available\nexplicitly. Some semantic relations are present already within the Tabular synopsis of categories,\nas Kirkpatrick (1998) explains: \u201cMost Heads are in pairs, representing the positive and negative\naspects of an idea, e.g. 852 Hope, 853 Hoplessness.\u201d This antonymy relationship that is present\nfor Heads does not necessarily translate into a relation of opposition for the words contained\nunder each Heads. This is due to the fact that Heads and words that belong to it represent two\nChapter 3. The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\n25\ndifferent types of concepts. The Head represents a general concept, whereas the words and\nphrases represent all of the various aspects of this concept. Thus, under the Head 539 School\ncan be found such notions as ;college, lyc\u00e9e, gymnasium, senior secondary school; \u2026\n;lecture room, lecture hall, auditorium, amphitheatre; and ;platform, stage,\npodium, estrade;.\nTwo types of explicit relationships are present at the word level: Cross-reference and See. Cross-\nreference is a link between Heads via the syntactic form of a word. For example, the Heads 373\nFemale and 169 Parentage are linked by the Cross-reference 169 maternity. The word\nmaternity is present within the group mother, grandmother 169 maternity in the Head 373\nFemale and is the first word of a paragraph in the head 169 Parentage. According to\nKirkpatrick (1998), the See relationship is used to refer the reader to another paragraph within\nthe same Head, where the idea under consideration is dealt with more thoroughly. An example of\nthis is when a general paragraph such as killing in Head 362 Killing: destruction of\nlife is followed by more specific paragraphs homicide and slaughter. The relationship\nappears in the following manner in the text: murder, assassination, bumping off (see\nhomicide).\nIt is a common misconception that the Thesaurus is simply a book of synonyms. Roget (1852)\nadmits in fact that \u201cit is hardly possible to find two words having in all respect the same\nmeaning, and being therefore interchangeable; that is, admitting of being employed\nindiscriminately, the one or the other, in all applications\u201d. According to Kirkpatrick (1998), the\nintention is to offer words that express every aspect of an idea, rather than to list synonyms. The\ngroups of words found under a Head follow one another in a logical sequence. Systematic\nsemantic relations, such as IS-A and PART-OF, are not required between the semicolon groups\nand the Head. For example, both restaurant and have brunch are found under the same Head\n301 Food: eating and drinking. Although the native English speaker can identify various\nrelations between food, restaurant and have brunch, it is not an easy thing to discover\nautomatically. This is a major challenge; some possible algorithms for automatic labeling of\nsemantic relations are presented in Chapter 6.\nWordNet is based on about fifteen semantic relations, the most important of which is synonymy.\nEvery part-of-speech in WordNet has a different set of semantic relations. It is important to note\nthat synonymy is the only relation between words. All others are between synsets. For example,\nthe synsets car, auto, automobile, machine, motorcar -- (4-wheeled motor vehicle; usually propelled by an internal combustion engine; \u201che needs a car to get to work\u201d) and accelerator, accelerator pedal, gas pedal, gas, throttle,\nChapter 3. The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\n26\nChapter 3. The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\n27\ngun -- (a pedal that controls the throttle valve; \u201che stepped on the gas\u201d) are\nlinked by the meronym (has part) relation, whereas the nouns car and auto are linked by\nsynonymy. Table 3.5 summarizes the semantic relations. All of the examples are taken from\nWordNet version 1.7.1. and {...} represents a synset.\nWordNet\u2019s semantic relations are discussed in detail in the International Journal of\nLexicography 3(4) and WordNet: An Electronic Lexical Database (Fellbaum, 1998).\n3.4 Accessing Roget\u2019s and WordNet\nIt is very important to have adequate methods of accessing an electronic lexical knowledge base.\nThese access methods should be designed in a computationally efficient manner, since this\nresource is to be machine-tractable, and faithfully reproduce how the printed version is used. For\nthe task of computerizing Roget\u2019s Thesaurus, a study of its manual use can offer good\nsuggestions. WordNet can also be a source of more ideas. Roget\u2019s provides an Index of the words\nand phrases in the Thesaurus. For every item a list of keywords, with their Head numbers and\npart-of-speech, indicates in what Paragraph a word can be found. The different Keywords give\nan indication of the various senses of a word. The combination keyword, head number, part-\nof-speech represents a unique key in the Thesaurus.\nThe following is an example of an Index entry:\ndaily\noften 139 adv.\nseasonal 141 adj.\nperidodically 141 adv.\njournal 528 n.\nthe press 528 n.\nusual 620 adj.\ncleaner 648 n.\nservant 742 n.\nThe Paragraph pointed to by the key journal 528 n. is the following:\n528 Publication\nN. ...\njournal, review magazine, glossy m., specialist m., women\u2019s m., male-interest m., pulp m.; part-work, periodical, serial, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual; gazette, trade journal, house magazine, trade publication 589 reading matter.\nChapter 3. The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\n28\nA Roget\u2019s Paragraph is made up of a Keyword and a sequence of Semicolon Groups. The\nKeyword, an italicized word at the beginning of a Paragraph, is not intended to be a synonym of\nthe words that follow it, but is rather a concept that generalizes the whole Paragraph. It also\nallows to identify the position of other words in the Index and to locate Cross-references\n(Kirkpatrick, 1998). A Semicolon Group is a list of closely related words and phrases, for\nexample: ; part-work, periodical, serial, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly,\nannual; Such lists are separated by semicolons. This is the smallest unit above single words and\nphrases in Roget\u2019s.\nMost people use the Index when looking up a word in the Thesaurus, but Roget (1852) intended\nhis classification system to also serve this purpose: \u201cBy the aid of this table the reader will, with\na little practice, readily discover the place which the peculiar topic he is in search of occupies in\nthe series; and on turning to the page in the body of the Work which contains it, he will find the\ngroup of expressions he requires, out of which he may cull those that are the most appropriate to\nhis purpose\u201d. Searching the Thesaurus like this allows looking at all of the words found under a\nHead, regardless of the part-of-speech. In this manner all of the concepts that express every\naspect of a given idea can be found.\nFor the human user, the Index is the most practical means of looking up a word. For the\ncomputer, the classification system is extremely practical, as it has been shown, for example, by\nYarowsky\u2019s (1992) word sense disambiguation experiment or the semantic similarity metric\npresented in Chapter 4. It is important to be able to locate a word within its semicolon group, and\nfrom there to look at the other words in the same Paragraph, the same Head, knowing at all times\nin which place the word is found in the classification system. Using the ELKB it must be possible\nto follow the different paths built from the parts of speech, semantic relations and the ontology.\nGraphical and command line interfaces exist for WordNet. Both work essentially in the same\nway. After selecting a word, all of its senses appear, listed within the synsets to which they\nbelong, ordered by frequency and part-of-speech. For example, the search for the word daily\nreturns the following:\nChapter 3. The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\n29\nAt this point, the user can decide to continue his search of the database by using one of the\nsemantic relations. The system does not show the exact location in the ontology where the search\nresults are originating from, nor can all the concepts describing an idea be easily extracted. The\nnumber of times the word senses occur in Semcor (Landes et al., 1998), a semantic concordance\nbased on the Brown Corpus (Francis and Kucera, 1982), is displayed by WordNet.\nAll the methods to access Roget\u2019s that the printed version offers have been implemented in the\nELKB. WordNet provides an interface to its lexical material in a manner that is similar to only\nusing Roget\u2019s index. The ELKB allows performing this type of search as well as using the\nclassification system.

The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\n30\nMB in size, are marked up using codes devised by the owners of the resource. Appendix E\npresents the steps for converting the codes into HTML-like tags. Appendix D lists the Perl scripts\nused for transforming the lexical material into a format that is suitable for the ELKB along with\ntheir accompanying documentation. The ELKB is created using only the Text file; the Index is\nconstructed using the words and phrases loaded in the knowledge base. This is a necessary step,\nas the supplied Index file does not contain entries for all of the words contained in the Thesaurus.\nCertain space-saving conventions are used in the source data. Where consecutive expressions use\nthe same word, repetitions may be avoided using \u201cor\u201d, as in \u201cdrop a brick or clanger\u201d,\n\u201ccountryman or \u2013woman\u201d. The repeated word may also be indicated by its first letter, followed\nby a full stop: \u201cweasel word, loan w., nonce w.,\u201d (Kirkpatrick, 1998). All such\nabbreviations must be expanded before the lexical material is loaded into the ELKB. A Perl script\nwas written to do this as well as to replace the Pearson codes by HTML-like tags, easier to\nprocess automatically. Other programs validate the expansion errors mostly due to noise in the\noriginal material."}, {"heading": "3.5.1 Errors and Exceptions in the Source Files", "text": "The original text files supplied by Pearson Education contain some errors.

There are some phrases where spaces are missing between\nthe words, for example \u201ccreativeaccounting\u201d instead of \u201ccreative accounting\u201d. Other\nwords are split which seem to be spelling mistakes at first but a closer look reveals that the\nmissing letters are separated from the words by a space, for example: \u201cincommunicativene\nss\u201d.

Appendix F\nshows 179 instances of errors where spaces are missing and 26 instances of errors that contain an\nextra space, as well as specifying the original file in which they can be found.\n3.6 The Java implementation of the ELKB The entire functionality of the printed version of Roget\u2019s has been implemented in Java. The\nELKB, which is comprised of eighteen classes, is organized around four major ones: the\nRogetELKB class which is the main entry point into the system, the Category class which models\nthe taxonomy and has methods to traverse it, the RogetText class which represents the 990 Heads\nas well as the words and phrases stored under them and the Index class which contains the\nreferences to all of the words and phrases in the Thesaurus. These four classes, as well as their\nrelation to the other fourteen, are described in the following sections. The class diagram of the\nELKB is shown in Figure 3.4. Appendix B presents a detailed documentation of the system.\nChapter 3. The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\n31\nChapter 3. The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\n32\nCorrectly reproducing the printed Roget\u2019s Thesaurus, creating an application programming\ninterface (API) that is both efficient an easy to use, performance, memory and the availability of\nthe ELKB software to the largest possible audience have been the main concerns of this\nimplementation. The library of Java API is used for all of the experiments included in this\ndissertation: evaluating the semantic similarity of words and phrases, the construction of lexical\nchains, and investigating algorithms for mapping the Thesaurus onto WordNet, presented in\nchapters 4, 5 and 6 respectively. The ELKB can be accessed by making direct call to the API, as\nwell as by using the command line and graphical user interface (GUI). A first version of the GUI\nwas created by Pierre Chr\u00e9tien and Gilles Roy to fulfill the requirements of their fourth-year\nHonors Software Engineering project. Appendix C presents the GUI and the command line\ninterface.\n3.6.1 The ELKBRoget and Related Classes\nThe ELKBRoget class is the one that contains all others in the system. It has methods to perform\nmanipulations on the ELKB, from looking up a word or phrase, calculating the distance\nbetweentwo words or phrases, to identifying their relative position in the taxonomy. Instances of\nthe Index and Category classes are loaded into memory to allow for rapid access. The Heads,\ncontained in the RogetText object, are read from files when required. This configuration is\nThe best compromise between performance and memory usage. Two objects, Path which\ncalculates and stores the path between two references, and PathSet which contains all paths\nbetween a pair of words and phrases, are accessed from ELKBRoget. They allow calculating the\nshortest path between two words or phrases.\n3.6.2 The Category and Related Classes\nThe Category class models the Tabular synopsis of categories described in Section 3.1. It is\nmade up of two arrays; the first contains Category and the second HeadInfo objects. The\nCategory objects are comprised of an array of Section objects, which in turn contain an array of\nSubSection objects, which have an array of Group objects which are finally made up of an array\nof HeadInfo objects. The HeadInfo objects describe a Head entirely with respect to its location in\nRoget\u2019s taxonomy. It is defined uniquely by the Class number, Section number, Sub-section\nname, Head Group, as well as the name and number of the Head. It requires little memory as it\ndoes not contain any of the words or phrases. The second array of the Category class contains the\n990 HeadInfo objects that describe the 990 Heads of the Thesaurus. Thus, the taxonomy can be\ntraversed depth-wise, starting with the Class objects, or breadth-wise by accessing the HeadInfo\nChapter 3. The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\n33\nobjects. It is often more interesting to access the array of Heads, as this can be done via random\naccess using a Head number.\n3.6.3 The RogetText and Related Classes\nThe RogetText class represents everything that is contained in the Text of the Thesaurus. It\ncontains the Head, Paragraph, SG and SemRel classes. The SG objects contain Semicolon\ngroups. The SemRel class is used to model Roget\u2019s explicit semantic relations, Cross-references\nand See-references, discussed in Section 3.3. A Head object contains five arrays of Paragraphs,\none for each of nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs and interjections, which are in turn made up of\nan array of SG objects. The RogetText is stored as 990 files, one for each Head. They are loaded\nas required. A word or phrase is looked up using a reference, for example: contempt 922 int.\nwhen searching for the phrase in your face. The reference specifies the Head number, 922 in\nthis example, which allows the specified Head to be retrieved in constant time. The correct\nParagraph is retrieved by finding the index of the Paragraph that corresponds to the reference,\nand looking up this Paragraph. The search is done in linear time and the look up in constant\ntime. To find the word or phrase in the Semicolon group, its membership must be first identified\nin the array of SG objects, and then the Semicolon group is searched sequentially. The ELKB\ncontains methods to retrieve the Paragraphs and SG objects in constant time if the references are\ntranslated into absolute addresses, for example the reference contempt 922 int. could be\nchanged to 922.5.1.1.3., which would represent Head 922, part-of-speech label interjection, 1st Paragraph, 1st Semicolon group and third word. As the lexical material does\nnot generally change, these references are not required to be calculated often, but the\ntransformation procedure has not been implemented in this version of the ELKB. There are 990\nHead, 6,432 Paragraph, and 59,877 SG objects in this computerized Roget\u2019s.\n3.6.4 The Index and Related Classes\nThe Index contains all of the words and phrases found in the 990 Heads. It consists of a hash\ntable of Index entries, which represent the words and phrases of the Thesaurus, with pointers to\ntheir corresponding references, as well as an array of all distinct references in the ELKB. The\nsame reference is used for all of the words or phrases in a Paragraph. It is more economical to\nstore this reference once and to have the entries maintain a pointer to it, rather than to store it\nevery time it is used. The size of the Index object is a major concern, as it must be stored in\nmemory to ensure rapid access. Finding an entry in the Index hash table and looking up its\ncorresponding references is performed in constant time. The references are stored in Reference\nobjects and their pointers are encoded as Strings, which represent their addresses in the\nChapter 3. The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\n34\nreferences array, separated by semicolons. For example, the Index words know-how, stealth,\ndiplomacy and intrigue all have the reference cunning 698 n. as do all the other words that\nare located in this Roget\u2019s Paragraph. Instead of storing this reference with every entry that it\nbelongs to, only the location in an array of unique references is kept. Since an entry may have\nseveral references, all the addresses are kept, for example 345:456:2045:12374. The Morphy\nand Variant classes are used by the Index object to perform transformations that allow retrieving\nwords and phrases written in forms that are not contained in the Thesaurus. These classes and the\ntransformations are described in the following section. There are 104,333 Index entries and\n223,219 total References, and 6,432 unique Reference objects in the ELKB."}, {"heading": "3.6.5 Morphological Transformations", "text": "The ability to perform morphological transformations is essential for a good lexical knowledge\nbase. The lemma of a word or phrase written in British English is generally stored in the Index,\nas this is the form in which it also appears in the 1987 edition of Penguin\u2019s Roget\u2019s Thesaurus. If\nan inflected word is passed to the ELKB it must be transformed so as to retrieve the appropriate\nReferences. Three tools are available to execute the passage of an input string into a recognized\nform: a file containing pairs of strings in American and British spelling; rules for detaching\ninflectional endings to obtain base forms; and exception list files for nouns, verbs, adjectives and\nadverbs in which inflected forms can be searched and base forms found. Appendix G presents\nthe American and British spelling word list used by the ELKB. It contains 646 pairs of spelling\nvariations and has been compiled from various lists freely available on the web. The rules,\npresented in Table 3.6, and the exception lists were taken from WordNet 1.7.1. The exception\nlists are quite extensive: 5992 pairs in the noun.exc file, 5285 in the verb.exc, 1486 in adj.exc\nand 7 in the adv.exc file. These transformations are performed in the Index class using the\nVariant and Morphy classes described previously. There is no method for identifying the part-of-\nspeech of an input string in the ELKB. For this reason all the detachment rules and exception\nfiles are applied and searched. Although this is not the best implementation, it allows a good\nrecall of the References stored in the Index.\nRetrieving phrases from the Index is problematic for the ELKB. There are many in Roget\u2019s, a lot\nof which are specific to British English, for example: man on the Clapham omnibus, drunk as\nDavid's sow or come from other languages, for example: faute de mieux, Alea jacta est.\nOnce again, the exact string must be entered for the corresponding references to be returned.\nVerbs will not be found if they are preceded by to or be for example: to offer, be\ndisorderly.

The Design and Implementation of the ELKB\n35\nprepositions, for example: ask for it. There are several possible solutions to the problem of\nphrases. They could be indexed under every word in the phrase or a method that retrieves all the\nphrases in the Index that contain specific words could be implemented, but none has been so far.\nThis is detrimental to the ELKB, as Roget\u2019s Thesaurus has a very rich collection of phrases, but\nhas not been a hindrance for obtaining good results in NLP applications, as is presented in\nChapter 4 and 5.\n3.6.6 Basic Operations of the ELKB\nThe basic operations of the ELKB are:\n\u2022 finding the references for a given word or phrase in the Index\n\u2022 looking up a given reference in the Text\nChapter 3.

Three are\npresented in this dissertation: measuring semantic similarity, building lexical chains, and\nmapping Roget\u2019s Thesaurus onto WordNet. The first uses the taxonomy to measure the distances,\nthe second relies on properties of the Thesaurus to identify specific relations, and the third\nexploits word and phrase look-up as well as Roget\u2019s hierarchy. In the current implementation of\nthe ELKB, the slowest operation is the word and phrase look up. This is due to the fact that\nHeads are read from a file, and sequential searches performed on the Paragraph and SG arrays to\nfind the location of the symbolic references. Performance can be greatly increased by loading the\n990 Heads into memory and using absolute addresses for the references. Both of these are\nrealistic improvements.\nChapter 4. Using Roget\u2019s Thesaurus to Measure Semantic Similarity\n37\n4 Using Roget\u2019s Thesaurus to Measure Semantic Similarity\nMeasuring semantic similarity with the ELKB allows us to present a first application of the\nsystem as well as to perform a qualitative evaluation. In this chapter, we define the notions of\nsynonymy and semantic similarity and explain a metric for calculating similarity based on\nRoget\u2019s taxonomy. We evaluate it using a few typical tests. The experiments in this chapter\ncompare the synonymy judgments of the system to gold standards established by Rubenstein and\nGoodenough (1965), Miller and Charles (1991) as well as Finkelstein et al. (2002; Gabrilovich\n2002) for assessing the similarity of pairs of words. We further evaluate the metric by using the\nsystem to answer Test of English as a Foreign Language [TOEFL] (Landauer and Dumais, 1997)\nand English as a Second Language tests [ESL] (Turney, 2001), as well as the Reader\u2019s Digest\nWord Power Game [RDWP] (Lewis, 2000-2001) questions where a correct synonym must be\nchosen amongst four target words. We compare the results to six other WordNet-based metrics\nand two statistical methods."}, {"heading": "4.1 The notions of synonymy and semantic similarity", "text": "People identify synonyms \u2014 strictly speaking, near-synonyms (Edmonds and Hirst, 2002) \u2014\nsuch as angel \u2013 cherub, without being able to define synonymy properly. The term tends to be\nused loosely, even in the crucially synonymy-oriented WordNet with the synset as the basic\nsemantic unit (Fellbaum, 1998, p. 23). Miller and Charles (1991) restate a formal, and linguis-\ntically quite inaccurate, definition of synonymy usually attributed to Leibniz: \u201ctwo words are\nsaid to be synonyms if one can be used in a statement in place of the other without changing the\nmeaning of the statement\u201d. With this strict definition there may be no perfect synonyms in\nnatural language (Edmonds and Hirst, ibid.). Computational linguists often find it more useful to\nestablish the degree of synonymy between two words, referred to as semantic similarity.\nMiller and Charles\u2019 semantic similarity is a continuous variable that describes the degree of\nsynonymy between two words (ibid.). They argue that native speakers can order pairs of words\nby semantic similarity, for example ship \u2013 vessel, ship \u2013 watercraft, ship \u2013\nriverboat, ship \u2013 sail, ship \u2013 house, ship \u2013 dog, ship \u2013 sun. The concept can be\nusefully extended to quantify relations between non-synonymous but closely related words, for\nexample airplane \u2013 wing.\nRubenstein and Goodenough (1965) investigated the validity of the assumption that \u201c... pairs of\nwords which have many contexts in common are semantically closely related\u201d. This led them to\nestablish synonymy judgments for 65 pairs of nouns with the help of human experts. Miller and\nChapter 4. Using Roget\u2019s Thesaurus to Measure Semantic Similarity\n38\nCharles (ibid.) selected 30 of those pairs, and studied semantic similarity as a function of the\ncontexts in which words are used. Others have calculated similarity using semantic nets (Rada et\nal., 1989), in particular WordNet (Resnik, 1995; Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Lin, 1998; Hirst and\nSt-Onge, 1998; Leacock and Chodorow, 1998) and Roget\u2019s Thesaurus (McHale, 1998), or\nstatistical methods (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Turney, 2001). Terra and Clarke (2003) present\na survey of statistical methods. This leads naturally to combined approaches that rely on\nstatistical methods enhanced with information contained in WordNet (Finkelstein et al., 2002)\nand methods that merge the results of various statistical systems (Bigham et al., 2003).\nThe objective is to test the intuition that Roget\u2019s Thesaurus, sometimes treated as a book of\nsynonyms, allows to measure semantic similarity effectively. We propose a measure of semantic\ndistance, the inverse of semantic similarity (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001) based on Roget\u2019s\ntaxonomy. We convert it into a semantic similarity measure, and empirically compare it to\nhuman judgments and to those of NLP systems. We evaluate the measure by performing the task\nof assigning a similarity value to pairs of nouns and choosing the correct synonym of a problem\nword given the choice of four target words.

He calculated the semantic distance between\nnouns using four metrics: counting the number of edges, the absolute number of words and\nphrases between two target nouns, and by using measures first presented by Resnik (1995) as\nwell as Jiang and Conrath (1997) for WordNet-based systems. McHale finds that edge counting\nis the best of the implemented Roget\u2019s-based measures and correlates extremely well with human\njudges. He calculates semantic similarity using the Miller and Charles (1991) set in which the\npairs cemetery \u2013 woodland and shore \u2013 woodland have been removed, as the noun woodland\nis not present in WordNet version 1.4, the resource to which the results are being compared.\nMcHale obtains a correlation with the gold standard of r=.88, which is quite close to r=.90\nobtained by Resnik (ibid.) who repeated the experiment using human judges on the 28 pairs of\nnouns. Although the publishers of Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus have not made it publicly\navailable in a machine-tractable format, it does suggest that we can obtain equally good results\nusing the ELKB.\nRada et al. (1989) explain that a distance measure in a taxonomy should satisfy the properties of\na metric. A function f(x,y) is a metric if the following properties are satisfied:\nChapter 4. Using Roget\u2019s Thesaurus to Measure Semantic Similarity\n41\n1) f(x, x) = 0, zero property,\n2) f(x,y) = f(y, x), symmetric property\n3) f(x, y) \u2265 0, positive property, and\n4) f(x, y) + f(y, z) \u2265 f(x, z), triangular inequality.\nThe proposed semantic distance measure using Roget\u2019s taxonomy is in fact a metric, as it\nsatisfies the four properies:\n1) zero property: the shortest distance between a word and itself is always zero as it belongs to a semicolon group.\n2) symmetric property: the shortest distance between two words is equal to the least number of edges between them. Order is not important, and therefore this property holds.\n3) positive property: the distance value between two words is an integer between 0 and 16.\n4) triangular inequality: if x and z belong to the same semicolon group, this property is true as f(x, z) = 0, and the sum of any other distance measure will be at least equal to 0. If x, y\nand z are all in different classes, then f(x,z) = 16 and f(x,y) + f(y,z) = 32. The shortest path\nbetween x and z going through y will always be greater or equal to the shortest path\nbetween x and z as the word y introduces the extra distance in the taxonomy towards the\nfirst common node.\nFor the purpose of comparing to other experiments, the semantic distance must be transformed\ninto a semantic similarity measure. The literature proposes two formulas to perform this\ntransformation. The first is to subtract the path length from the maximum possible path length\n(Resnik, 1995):\nsim1 (w1, w2) = 16 \u2013 [min distance(r1, r2)] (1)\nThe second is to take the inverse of the distance value plus one (Lin, 1998):\nsim2 (w1, w2) = 1 / (1 + [min distance(r1, r2)] ) (2)\nIn both formulas r1 and r2 are the sets of references for the words or phrases w1 and w2. As the\nmaximum distance in the Thesaurus is 16, the values for sim1 range from 0 to 16 and for sim2 from 0.059 to 1.000. In both formulas, the more related the two words or phrases are, the larger\nthe score. As the distances are quite small, the second formula can never reach a value close to 0.\nChapter 4. Using Roget\u2019s Thesaurus to Measure Semantic Similarity\n42\nThe constant 1 which is added to the divider is also quite arbitrary. The first formula is best\nsuited to edge counting as it maintains the same distribution of values as the distance metric. We\nuse it for the experiments presented in this chapter."}, {"heading": "4.3 An Evaluation Based on Human Judgments", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.3.1 The Experiment", "text": "Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965) established synonymy judgments for 65 pairs of nouns.\nThey invited 51 judges who assigned to every pair a score between 4.0 and 0.0 indicating\nsemantic similarity. They chose words from non-technical every day English. They felt that,\nsince the phenomenon under investigation was a general property of language, it was not\nnecessary to study technical vocabulary. Miller and Charles (1991) repeated the experiment\nrestricting themselves to 30 pairs of nouns selected from Rubentein and Goodenough\u2019s list,\ndivided equally amongst words with high, intermediate and low similarity. More recently,\nFinkelstein et al. (2002) have prepared the WordSimilarity \u2013 353 Test Collection (Gabrilovich,\n2002) which contains 353 English word pairs along with similarity judgments performed by\nhumans. The set also contains proper nouns and verbs. It is discussed in more detail in the next\nsection.\nThe three experiments have been repeated using the Roget\u2019s Thesaurus system. The results are\ncompared to six other similarity measures that rely on WordNet. We use Pedersen\u2019s Semantic\nDistance software package (2003) with WordNet 1.7.1 to obtain the results. The first WordNet\nmeasure used is edge counting. It serves as a baseline, as it is the simplest and most intuitive\nmeasure. The next measure, from Hirst and St-Onge (1998), relies on the path length as well as\nthe number of changes of direction in the path; they define these changes in function of WordNet\nsemantic relations. Jiang and Conrath (1997) propose a combined approach based on edge\ncounting enhanced by the node-based approach of the information content calculation proposed\nby Resnik (1995). Leacock and Chodorow (1998) count the path length in nodes rather than\nlinks, and adjust it to take into account the maximum depth of the taxonomy. Lin (1998)\ncalculates semantic similarity using a formula derived from information theory. Resnik (1995)\ncalculates the information content of the concepts that subsume them in the taxonomy. We\ncalculate the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient for the human judgments with the\nvalues achieved by the systems. The correlation is significant to at the 0.01 level.

Using Roget\u2019s Thesaurus to Measure Semantic Similarity\n44\nwill have a score of 10 to 14, and words that cannot be found in the same Head, therefore do not\nbelong to the same concept, will have a score between 0 and 8. Roget\u2019s results correlate very\nwell with human judgment for the Miller and Charles list (r=.878), almost attaining the upper\nbound (r=.885) set by human judges (Resnik, 1995) despite the outlier crane \u2013 implement, two\nwords that are not related in the Thesaurus.\nThe correlation between human judges and Roget\u2019s for the Rubenstein and Goodenough data is\nalso very good (r=.818) as shown in Table 4.3. Appendix I presents the 65 pairs of nouns. The\noutliers merit discussion. Roget\u2019s deems five pairs of low similarity words to be of intermediate\nsimilarity, all with the semantic distance value of 12. We therefore find these pairs of words all\nunder the same Head and belonging to noun groups. The Thesaurus makes correct associations\nbut not the most intuitive ones: glass - jewel is assigned a value of 1.78 by the human judges\nbut can be found under the Head 844 Ornamentation, car \u2013 journey is assigned 1.55 and is\nfound under the Head 267 Land travel, monk \u2013 oracle 0.91 found under Head 986 Clergy,\nboy \u2013 rooster 0.44 under Head 372 Male, and fruit \u2013 furnace 0.05 under Head 301 Food:\neating and drinking.\nWe have also performed the same experiment on the WordSimilarity \u2013 353 Test Collection. The\ncorrelation of Roget\u2019s measure with human judges is r=.539, which seems quite low, but is still\nbetter than the best WordNet based measure, r=.375, obtained using Resnik\u2019s function and\ncomparable to Finkelstein et al.\u2019s combined metric which obtains a score of r=.550. Table 4.4\nsummarizes these results and Appendix J presents the entire 353 word pair list. We cannot\nsimply attribute the low scores to the measures not scaling up to larger data sets. The Finkelstein\net al. list contains pairs that are associated but not similar in the semantic sense, for example:\nliquid \u2013 water. The list also contains many culturally biased pairs, for example: Arafat \u2013 terror\nand verbs. Table 4.5 presents all of the pairs for which at least one word is not present in Roget\u2019s.\nThese can be placed in five categories: proper nouns, verbs, new words that were not in\nwidespread use in 1986, words for which the plural is present in Roget\u2019s but not its singular\nform, and words that are simply not in the Thesaurus. The authors of the list describe it as\nrepresenting various degrees of similarity and write that they employed 16 subjects to rate\nChapter 4.

Using Roget\u2019s Thesaurus to Measure Semantic Similarity\n46\nthe semantic similarity on a scale from 0 to 10, 0 representing totally unrelated words and 10\nvery much related or identical words (Finkelstein et al., 2002). They do not explain the\nmethodology used for preparing this list. Human subjects find it more difficult to use a scale\nfrom 0 to 10 rather than 0 to 4. These issues cast a doubt on the validity of this list, and we\ntherefore do not consider it as a suitable benchmark for performing experiments on semantic\nsimilarity.\nResnik (1995) argues that edge counting using WordNet 1.4 is not a good measure of semantic\nsimilarity as it relies on the notion that links in the taxonomy represent uniform distances. Tables\n4.2 and 4.3 show that this measure performs well for WordNet 1.7.1 . It is most probable that\nGeorge Miller\u2019s team has much improved the lexical databases\u2019 taxonomy and that the distances\nbetween words are more uniform, but the goal of this dissertation is not to investigate the\nimprovements made to WordNet. Table 4.6 shows that it is difficult to replicate accurately\nexperiments using WordNet-based measures. Budanitsky and Hirst (2001) repeated the Miller\nand Charles experiment using the WordNet similarity measures of Hirst and St-Onge (1998),\nJiang and Conrath (1997), Leacock and Chodorow (1998), Lin (1998) and Resnik (1995).

Such tests have questions where the correct\nsynonym is one of four possible choices. TOEFL (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), ESL (Turney,\n2001), and RDWP (Lewis, 2000-2001) contain these kinds of questions. Although this evaluation\nmethod is not widespread in NLP, researchers have used it in Psychology (Landauer and\nDumais, ibid.) and Machine Learning (Turney, ibid.). The experimental question set consists of\n80 TOEFL questions provided by the Educational Testing Service via Thomas Landauer, 50 ESL\nquestions created by Donna Tatsuki for Japanese ESL students (Tatsuki, 1998), 100 RDWP\nquestions gathered by Peter Turney and 200 RDWP questions gathered from 2000 \u2013 2001 issues\nof the Canadian edition of Reader\u2019s Digest (Lewis, ibid.) by Tad Stach.\nA RDWP question is presented like this: \u201cCheck the word or phrase you believe is nearest in meaning. ode \u2013 A: heavy debt. B: poem. C: sweet smell. D: surprise.\u201d (Lewis, 2001, n. 938). The ELKB calculates the semantic distance between the\nproblem word and each choice word or phrase. The choice word with the shortest semantic\ndistance becomes the solution. Choosing the word or phrase that has the most paths with the\nshortest distance breaks ties. Phrases that cannot be found in the Thesaurus present a special\nproblem. The distance between each word in the choice phrase and the problem word is\ncalculated; we ignore the conjunction and, the preposition to, and the verb be. The system\nconsiders the shortest distance between the individual words of the phrase and the problem word\nas the semantic distance for the phrase. This technique, although simplistic, can deal with\nphrases like rise and fall; to urge; and be joyous that may not be found in the Thesaurus.\nThe ELKB is not restricted to nouns when finding the shortest path \u2013 it considers nouns,\nadjectives, verbs and adverbs. Using the previous RDWP example, the system would output the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 ode N. to heavy debt N., length = 12, 42 path(s) of this length\n\u2022 ode N. to poem N., length = 2, 2 path(s) of this length\n\u2022 ode N. to sweet smell N., length = 16, 6 path(s) of this length\n\u2022 ode N. to surprise VB., length = 12, 18 path(s) of this length\nRoget thinks that ode means poem: CORRECT\nFigure 4.2: Solution to a RDWP question using the ELKB.\nChapter 4.

The purpose of this experiment is not to improve the measures, but to use them as a\ncomparison for the ELKB. The answer is the choice word that has the largest semantic similarity\nvalue with the problem word, except for edge-counting where the system picks the smallest\nvalue, which represents the shortest distance. When ties occur, a partial score is given; .5 if two\nwords are tied for the highest similarity value, .33 if three, and .25 if four. The results appear in\nTables 4.7 to 4.9. Appendix K presents the output of the ELKB and the systems using WordNet-\nbased measures implemented using the Semantic Distance software package (Pedersen, 2003).\nWe have not tailored the WordNet measures to the task of answering these questions. All of\nthem, except Hirst and St-Onge, rely on the IS-A hierarchy to calculate the path between words.\nThis implies that these measures have been limited to finding similarities between nouns, as the\nWordNet hyponym tree only exists for nouns and verbs; there are hardly any links between parts\nof speech. We have not implemented special techniques to deal with phrases. It is therefore quite\nprobable that the WordNet-based similarity measures can be improved for the task of answering\nsynonymy questions.\nThis experiment also compares the results to those achieved by state-of-the-art statistical\ntechniques. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a general theory of acquired similarity and\nknowledge representation (Landauer and Dumais, 1997). It was used to answer the 80 TOEFL\nquestions. The algorithm, called PMI-IR (Turney, 2001), uses Pointwise Mutual Information\n(PMI) and Information Retrieval (IR) to measure the similarity of pairs of words.

The ELKB performs extremely well, obtaining a rating of\nExcellent, for the questions pertaining to Greek rooted words and manners. This can be\nattributed to the fact that the first edition of the Thesaurus was prepared during the Victorian era\nby a doctor who was well accustomed to Greek words and good manners.

The original implementation was inspired by the notion of cohesion in discourse (Halliday\nand Hasan, 1976). An electronic system requires a sufficiently rich and subtle lexical resource to\ndecide on the semantic proximity of words.\nComputational linguists have used lexical chains in a variety of tasks, from text segmentation\n(Morris and Hirst, 1991; Okumura and Honda, 1994), to summarization (Barzilay, 1997;\nBarzilay and Elhadad, 1997; Brunn, Chali and Pinchak, 2001; Silber and McCoy, 2000, 2002),\ndetection of malapropisms (Hirst and St-Onge, 1998), the building of hypertext links within and\nbetween texts (Green, 1999), analysis of the structure of texts to compute their similarity\n(Ellman, 2000), topic detection (Chali, 2001), and even a form of word sense disambiguation\n(Barzilay, 1997; Okumura and Honda, 1994). Most of the systems use WordNet to build lexical\nchains, perhaps in part because it is readily available. Building lexical chains is a natural task for\nRoget\u2019s Thesaurus as they were conceived using this resource. Ellman (ibid.) has used the 1911\nedition of Roget\u2019s and the 1987 edition of Longman\u2019s Original Roget\u2019s Thesaurus of English\nWords and Phrases.

The original lexical chain\nalgorithm (Morris and Hirst, ibid.) exploits certain organizational properties of Roget\u2019s\nThesaurus.

Choose a set of thesaural relations;\n2. Select a set of candidate words;\n3. Build all proto-chains for each candidate word;\n4. Select the best proto-chains for each candidate word;\n5. Select the lexical chains."}, {"heading": "5.2.1 Step 1: Choose a Set of Thesaural Relations", "text": "Halliday and Hasan (1976) have identified five basic classes of dependency relationships\nbetween words that allow classifying lexical cohesion. Identifying these relationships in a text is\nthe first step towards constructing lexical chains. These five classes are:\n1. Reiteration with identity of reference:\na. Mary bit into a peach.\nb. Unfortunately the peach wasn\u2019t ripe.\nChapter 5. Automating the Construction of Lexical Chains using Roget\u2019s\n56\n2. Reiteration without identity of reference:\na. Mary ate some peaches.\nb. She likes peaches very much.\n3. Reiteration by means of a superordinate:\na. Mary ate a peach.\nb. She likes fruit.\n4. Systematic semantic relation (systematically classifiable):\na. Mary likes green apples.\nb. She does not like red ones.\n5. Nonsystematic semantic relation (not systematically classifiable):\na. Mary spent three hours in the garden yesterday.\nb. She was digging potatoes.\nOf the five basic classes of dependency relationships, the first two are easy to identify, the next\ntwo are identifiable using a resource such as Roget\u2019s or WordNet. Morris and Hirst identify five\ntypes of thesaural relations that suggest the inclusion of a candidate word in a chain (1991).\nAlthough the fourth edition of Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus (Chapman, 1977) is used, the\nrelations can be described according to the structure of Penguin\u2019s Roget\u2019s Thesaurus, which has\nbeen presented in Chapter 3. The five thesaural relations used are:\n1. Inclusion in the same Head.\n2. Inclusion in two different Heads linked by a Cross-reference.\n3. Inclusion in References of the same Index Entry.\n4. Inclusion in the same Head Group.\n5. Inclusion in two different Heads linked to a common third Head by a Cross-reference.\nMorris and Hirst state that although these five relations are used \u201cthe first two are by far the most\nprevalent, constituting over 90% of the lexical relationships.\u201d\nIn our implementation, the decision has been made to adopt only a refinement of the first\nthesaural relation, as it is the most frequent relation, can be computed rapidly and consists of a\nlarge set of closely related words. The use of the second relation is computationally expensive\nand not intuitive. A Cross-reference in Roget\u2019s Thesaurus belongs to a Semicolon Group and\npoints to another Paragraph in a specific Head. For example, the Cross-reference 137 timely in\nthe Semicolon Group ;in loco, well-timed, auspicious, opportune, 137 timely;\npoints from this Semicolon Group in the adjective Paragraph with keyword advisable in the\nChapter 5. Automating the Construction of Lexical Chains using Roget\u2019s\n57\nHead 642 Good Policy to the adjective paragraph with keyword timely in Head 137\nOccasion: timeliness. The Cross-reference is therefore a relation from a Semicolon Group to\na Paragraph and does not link all words and phrases in a Paragraph to those of the Paragraph to\nwhich it points. It is clearly not symmetric and does not link comparable concepts. There are\nabout 10 times more words and phrases in the Thesaurus than Cross-references, which suggests\nthat the first relation should be at least 10 times more frequent than the second one.\nIn conjunction with the first relation, simple term repetition is exploited. All other presented by\nMorris and Hirst are discarded. The two relations used for the implementation of lexical chains\nusing the ELKB are:\n1. Repetition of the same word, for example: Rome, Rome.\n2. Inclusion in the same Paragraph.\nChapter 3 discusses the manner in which words and phrases found under the same Paragraph are\nrelated. A large number of them are near-synonyms, or are related by the IS-A and PART-OF\nrelations, as is experimentally shown in Chapter 6.\nFor the sake of comparison, here are WordNet relations that Silber and McCoy (2002) use in\ntheir implementation of lexical chains:\n1. Two noun instances are identical, and are used in the same sense.\n2. Two noun instances are synonyms.\n3. The senses of two noun instances are linked by the hypernym / hyponym relation.\n4. The senses of two noun instances are siblings in the hypernym / hyponym tree.\nThe first three relations used by Silber and McCoy have counterparts in the Roget\u2019s Thesaurus\nimplementation. A sense of a word or phrase can be uniquely identified in the ELKB by its\nlocation in the taxonomy. The fourth relationship is used to link all of the words and phrases that\nare hypernyms or hyponyms of a synset. In this manner, train and railroad train are related\nas they belong to the same synset, they are related to boat train as it is hyponym of train. Car\ntrain, freight train, rattler, hospital train, mail train, passenger train,\nstreamliner and subway train are in turn all related to boat train as they are hyponyms of\ntrain. A counterpart of this relation cannot be explicitly found in the Thesaurus as it is\ndependent on WordNet\u2019s structure, although the synsets that are grouped by these four relations\nare comparable to the Semicolon Groups that make up a Paragraph, as is discussed in Chapter 6.\nMorphological processing must be automated to assess the relation between words. This is done\nChapter 5. Automating the Construction of Lexical Chains using Roget\u2019s\n58\nboth by WordNet and the ELKB. A resource that contains proper names and world knowledge,\nsuch as the layout of streets in the city of Ottawa, or who is the Prime Minister of Canada, would\nbe a great asset for the construction of lexical chains. This information is not found in Roget\u2019s or\nWordNet, but could be added in some simplified form, using gazetteers and other knowledge\nsources, like the World Gazetteer (World Gazetter, 2003) or the Central Intelligence Agency\nWorld Factbook (CIA Factbook, 2002).

The number of meta-chains is a function of the\nnumber of senses of a word and the number of remaining candidate words to be considered for\nthe chain. The best meta-chains retained for each word by the system ordered by their score with\nthe sense number (which corresponds to the Head in which the word can be found) and line\nnumbers of the first word are:\n1. train, rails, train, train, train, line, train, train, embankment [score: 9.0, sense: 624, line: 1]\n2. direction, regard, reference, respect [score: 4.0, sense: 9, line: 1]\n3. travelling, travelling, takes, takes [score: 4.0, sense: 981, line: 1]\n4. suppose, regard, takes, takes [score: 4.0, sense: 485, line: 1]\n5. regard, takes, takes [score: 3.0, sense: 438, line: 2]\n6. advantage, takes, takes [score: 3.0, sense: 916, line: 2]\n7. takes, takes, respect [score: 3.0, sense: 851, line: 3]\n8. constant, rigid [score: 2.0, sense: 494, line: 1]\n9. events, event [score: 2.0, sense: 725, line: 2]\n10.line, relative [score: 2.0, sense: 27, line: 3]\n11.rails, respect [score: 1.75, sense: 924, line: 1]\nOnce it is determined to which meta-chain a word contributes the most, the final lexical chains\ngenerated by the system are:\n1. train, rails, train, train, train, line, train, train, embankment [score: 9.0, sense: 624, line: 1]\n2. suppose, regard, takes, takes [score: 4.0, sense: 485, line: 1]\n3. direction, reference, respect [score: 3.0, sense: 9, line: 1]\n4. travelling, travelling [score: 2.0, sense: 981, line: 1]\n5. constant, rigid [score: 2.0, sense: 494, line: 1]\nChapter 5. Automating the Construction of Lexical Chains using Roget\u2019s\n62\n6. events, event [score: 2.0, sense: 725, line: 2]\nAs a comparison, these eight lexical chains are obtained by Ellman (2002):\n1. train, rails, train, line, train, train, embankment\n2. direction, people, direction\n3. reference, regard, relative-to, respect\n4. travelling, velocity, travelling, rigid\n5. suppose, reference-to, place, place\n6. advantage, events, event\n7. long, constant\n8. figure, body\nThe Einstein quotation was first studied by St-Onge (1995) who obtained the following nine\nlexical chains using his WordNet-based system:\n1. train, velocity, direction, train, train, train, advantage, reference, reference-to, train, train, respect-to, simultaneity\n2. travelling, travelling\n3. rails, line\n4. constant, given\n5. figure, people, body\n6. regard, particular, point\n7. events, event, place, place\n8. definition\n9. embankment\nThe ELKB does not generate as many chains as Ellman or St-Onge, but the chains seem to\nadequately represent the paragraph. The best lexical chains generated by the ELKB {train,\nrails, train, train, train, line, train, train, embankment} and Ellman {train,\nrails, train, line, train, train, embankment} are almost identical. This is to be\nexpected, as they both use Roget\u2019s Thesaurus. The only difference is the number of repetitions of\nthe nouns train, which is an indication that Ellman\u2019s implementation is not as rigorous as it\nshould be. It is surprising that the remaining chains are so different, especially since certain\nChapter 5. Automating the Construction of Lexical Chains using Roget\u2019s\n63\nwords are not even related in the ELKB, for example direction and people, or advantage and\nevent, as in the chains {direction, people, direction} and {advantage, events,\nevent}. This is a clear indication that the versions of Roget\u2019s used by the systems are quite\ndifferent. Ellman\u2019s second chain {direction, people, direction} is clearly erroneous since\nthe word direction only appears once in the paragraph. St-Onge generates chains that are hard\nto quantify as coherent compared the ones the two other systems build. In the chain {train, velocity, direction, train, train, train, advantage, reference, reference-to, train, train, respect-to, simultaneity} there is no intuitive relation between velocity\nand respect-to, although it is possible to consider a transitive relation using other words in the\nchain. It is odd that rails and line are not in the same chain as train, since these concepts are\nvery closely related. The singleton chains {definition} and {embankment} are also listed.\nLexical chain building systems generally do not consider these as they are too short to represent\na cohesive region in a text. This subjective comparison does not allow determining which system\nis best. An objective way is required for evaluating lexical chains, which we discuss in Section\n5.6."}, {"heading": "5.4 A Comparison to the Original Implementation", "text": "Morris\u2019 and Hirst\u2019s (1991) demonstrate their manual lexical chain procedure on the first section\nof an article in Toronto magazine, December 1987, by Jay Teitel, entitled \u201cOutland\u201d. This\nsection presents the text, where the candidate words are highlighted, and compares the lexical\nchains generated by the ELKB to those of the original algorithm.\nI spent the first 19 years of my life in the suburbs, the initial 14 or so relatively contented, the\nlast four or five wanting mainly to be elsewhere. The final two I remember vividly: I passed them\ndriving to and from the University of Toronto in a red 1962 Volkswagen 1500 afflicted with night blindness. The car's lights never worked - every dusk turned into a kind of medieval race\nagainst darkness, a panicky, mournful rush north, away from everything I knew was exciting,\ntoward everything I knew was deadly. I remember looking through the windows at the\ncommuters mired in traffic beside me and actively hating them for their passivity. I actually punched holes in the white vinyl ceiling of the Volks and then, by way of penance, wrote beside\nthem the names and phone numbers of the girls I would call when I had my own apartment in the\ncity. One thing I swore to myself: I would never live in the suburbs again.\nMy aversion was as much a matter of environment as it was traffic - one particular piece of the\nsuburban setting: \"the cruel sun.\" Growing up in the suburbs you can get used to a surprising number of things - the relentless \"residentialness\" of your surroundings, the weird certainty you\nhave that everything will stay vaguely new-looking and immune to historic soul no matter how\nmany years pass. You don't notice the eerie silence that descends each weekday when every\nsound is drained out of your neighbourhood along with all the people who've gone to work. I got used to pizza, and cars, and the fact that the cultural hub of my community was the collective TV\nChapter 5. Automating the Construction of Lexical Chains using Roget\u2019s\n64\nset. But once a week I would step outside as dusk was about to fall and be absolutely bowled\nover by the setting sun, slanting huge and cold across the untreed front lawns, reminding me not just how barren and sterile, but how undefended life could be. As much as I hated the\nsuburban drive to school, I wanted to get away from the cruel suburban sun.\nWhen I was married a few years later, my attitude hadn't changed. My wife was a city girl\nherself, and although her reaction to the suburbs was less intense than mine, we lived in a series\nof apartments safely straddling Bloor Street. But four years ago, we had a second child, and simultaneously the school my wife taught at moved to Bathurst Street north of Finch Avenue.\nShe was now driving 45 minutes north to work every morning, along a route that was perversely\nidentical to the one I'd driven in college.\nWe started looking for a house. Our first limit was St. Clair - we would go no farther north. When we took a closer look at the price tags in the area though, we conceded that maybe we'd\nhave to go to Eglinton - but that was definitely it. But the streets whose names had once been\nmagical barriers, latitudes of tolerance, quickly changed to something else as the Sundays\npassed. Eglinton became Lawrence, which became Wilson, which became Sheppard. One wind-\nswept day in May I found myself sitting in a town-house development north of Steeles Avenue called Shakespeare Estates. It wasn't until we stepped outside, and the sun, blazing unopposed\nover a country club, smacked me in the eyes, that I came to. It was the cruel sun. We got into the\ncar and drove back to the Danforth and porches as fast as we could, grateful to have been\nreprieved.\nAnd then one Sunday in June I drove north alone. This time I drove up Bathurst past my wife's\nnew school, hit Steeles, and kept going, beyond Centre Street and past Highway 7 as well. I\npassed farms, a man selling lobsters out of his trunk on the shoulder of the road, a chronic care\nhospital, a country club and what looked like a mosque. I reached a light and turned right. I saw\na sign that said Houses and turned right again.\nIn front of me lay a virgin crescent cut out of pine bush. A dozen houses were going up, in\nvarious stages of construction, surrounded by hummocks of dry earth and stands of\nprecariously tall trees nude halfway up their trunks. They were the kind of trees you might see in\nthe mountains. A couple was walking hand-in-hand up the dusty dirt roadway, wearing matching blue track suits. On a \"front lawn\" beyond them, several little girls with hair exactly\nthe same colour of blond as my daughter's were whispering and laughing together. The air\nsmelled of sawdust and sun.\nIt was a suburb, but somehow different from any suburb I knew. It felt warm.\nIt was Casa Drive.\nIn 1976 there were 2,124,291 people in Metropolitan Toronto, an area bordered by Steeles\nAvenue to the north, Etobicoke Creek on the west, and the Rouge River to the east. In 1986, the\nsame area contained 2,192,721 people, an increase of 3 percent, all but negligible on an urban\nscale. In the same span of time the three outlying regions stretching across the top of Metro -\nPeel, Durham, and York - increased in population by 55 percent, from 814,000 to some 1,262,000. Half a million people had poured into the crescent north of Toronto in the space of a\ndecade, during which time the population of the City of Toronto actually declined as did the\npopulation of the \"old\" suburbs with the exception of Etobicoke and Scarborough.

The 4 seconds that it takes to load the\nELKB into memory is included in these times. This implementation is clearly much slower than\nSilber and McCoy\u2019s although it has not been refined for this task. One of the goals of their\nWordNet-based implementation is to optimize the process so as to construct chains for extremely\nlarge documents. It is the fastest known lexical chain building system."}, {"heading": "5.6 Evaluating Lexical Chains", "text": "Morris and Hirst (1991) evaluate their lexical chains by comparing them to the heading structure\nof a text assigned by the author. This evaluation is adequate if the goal of lexical chains is to\nsegment a text into distinct regions according to their topic. It assumes that the author has\npresented the only possible correct partitioning of the text. Lexical chains are generally not used\nfor this purpose, Barzilay (1997) has even segmented the text before building the chains, and\nauthors do not always assign subject headings to identify the various ideas. For these reasons,\nthat evaluation procedure cannot be used to evaluate and objectively compare the lexical chains\ncreated by various systems.\nHirst and St-Onge (1998) propose the task of malapropism detection to evaluate lexical chains. A\nmalapropism is defined as \u201cthe confounding of an intended word with another word of similar\nsound or similar spelling that has a quite different and malapropos meaning, for example, an\ningenuous [for ingenious] machine for peeling oranges.\u201d (Fellbaum, 1998, p. 304). This task is\nnot very common and the evaluation procedure requires a corpus of malapropisms, a resource\nthat is not readily available.\nSilber and McCoy (2002) evaluate their implementation by comparing their lexical chains to\nsummaries of a document collection. Their evaluation method is inspired by those used in text\nsummarization. Their corpus is made up of scientific documents with abstracts and chapters from\nUniversity textbooks that contain chapter summaries. Marcu (1999) has argued that abstracts of\narticles can be accepted as reasonable summaries. This procedure involves comparing the senses\nof the words in the lexical chains to the senses of the words in the abstract. This is necessary, as\nthe summaries many not contain the same words as the texts, and therefore the lexical chains.\nChapter 5. Automating the Construction of Lexical Chains using Roget\u2019s\n68\nThis evaluation procedure is interesting, since large amounts of documents with their summaries\nare produced for the Document Understanding Conferences (DUC, 2001, 2002). For this\nevaluation procedure to work with Roget\u2019s, it is necessary to tag the senses of the words and\nphrases in the texts and summaries using those found in the Thesaurus. We have not performed\nor implemented any manual or automatic procedure to do so. Although promising, we have not\nevaluated our implementation of lexical chains using this procedure.\nLexical chains can also be evaluated by assessing the quality of the summaries that are produced\nby them (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997; Brunn, Chali and Pinchak, 2001) but the investigation of\nthis task is beyond the scope of this dissertation."}, {"heading": "5.7 About the Straightforwardness of Implementing Lexical Chains", "text": "The experiment shows that it is possible to create lexical chains using our electronic version of\nRoget\u2019s Thesaurus, but that it is not as straightforward as it was originally claimed. Roget\u2019s has a\nvery rich structure that can be exploited for lexical chain construction. Using the ELKB, many\nmore thesaural relations can be used than in this implementation, but they come with a\ncomputational cost. WordNet implementations have access to a different set of relations and\nlexical material. Although there is a consensus on the high-level algorithm, there are significant\ndifferences in implementations. The major criticism of lexical chains is that there is no adequate\nevaluation of their quality. Until it is established, it will be hard to compare implementations of\nlexical chain construction algorithms. This experiment demonstrates that the ELKB and WordNet\ncan be used effectively for the same task.\nChapter 6. Finding the Hidden Treasures in the Thesaurus\n69\n6 Finding the Hidden Treasures in the Thesaurus\nThe experiments presented in Chapters 4 and 5 show that Roget\u2019s Thesaurus is a valuable\nresource for NLP, yet these applications exploit only a fraction of this abundant lexical\nknowledge base. A current trend in NLP is to combine lexical resources to overcome their\nindividual weaknesses. This chapter discusses the correspondence between Roget\u2019s and\nWordNet. We show a method for disambiguating Roget\u2019s paragraphs by mean of groups of\nsynsets. This procedure exposes WordNet\u2019s semantic relations that are present in the Thesaurus.\nThe fact that the ELKB does not label semantic relations explicitly is a major hindrance for NLP\napplications: \u201cRoget\u2019s remains \u2026 an attractive lexical resource for those with access to it. Its\nwide, shallow hierarchy is densely populated with nearly 200,000 words and phrases. The\nrelationships among the words are also much richer than WordNet\u2019s IS-A or HAS-PART links.\nThe price paid for this richness is a somewhat unwieldy tool with ambiguous links\u201d (McHale,\n1998). Machine learning techniques can label these relations given sufficient training data. This\nchapter concludes with a study of avenues to improve the ELKB using Longman\u2019s Dictionary of\nContemporary English (LDOCE) (Procter, 1978).\n6.1 A Quantitative Comparison of Roget\u2019s and WordNet\nChapter 3 describes the similarities between Roget\u2019s and WordNet. This section presents a\ndetailed examination of the portions that contain the most and least overlap in lexical content.\nRoget\u2019s ontology can be divided into classes that describe the external world (Abstract\nRelations, Space, Matter) and ones that describe the internal world of the human. These\nsubjects almost evenly dived the lexical material, 446 headwords belong to the external world,\n544 to the internal world. WordNet seems to favor the external world, with only two of the nine\nunique beginners {psychological feature} and {act, human action, human activity}\ndescribing the internal world of the human. Intuition suggests that Roget\u2019s and WordNet should\nhave a big overlap in lexical material pertaining to the material world. Experiments have\nidentified a list of over 45,000 strings that can be found in WordNet 1.7.1 and the 1987 Roget\u2019s.\nTable 6.1 presents the distribution of words and phrases within the ELKB ordered by class\nnumber. % of c.h., % of c.k. and % of c.s. in Table 6.1 indicate the percentage of heads,\nkeywords and strings that can be found in this common word and phrase list.\nBoth lexical resources are similar in absolute size, containing about 200,000 word-sense pairs.\n53% of all words in Roget\u2019s are nouns, 20% adjectives, 23% verbs, 4% adverbs and less than 1%\nare interjections. 74% of WordNet are nouns, 15% adjectives, 8% verbs and 3% adverbs. There\nare no interjections in WordNet. Intuition suggested a large overlap between both resources, but\nChapter 6. Finding the Hidden Treasures in the Thesaurus\n70\nthe 46,399 common words and phrases only represent about 43% of the unique words and\nphrases in the Thesaurus and 32% of WordNet. All of the occurrences of common strings make\nup 63% of Roget\u2019s total lexical content. The equivalent calculation has not been performed for\nWordNet. The top-level of the ontologies hinted that the overlap would be concentrated in the\nfirst three Roget classes, but the results in Table 6.1 shows the common strings distributed pretty\nevenly across the whole resource. A head-per-head analysis shows that 78% of head names as\nwell as 75% of paragraph keywords can be found in WordNet. 86% of heads have at least 50% of\ntheir words in common with those of WordNet and 93% of heads have at least 50% of keywords\nin common. Table 6.2 shows the 10 heads with the highest and lowest percentage of common\nstrings. H in WN indicates that the head name can be found in WordNet.\nIdentifying the areas where WordNet and the Thesaurus overlap are of interest since this should\nbe a good indicator of where the two resources can be combined. The comparison of the Head\n567 Perspicuity has with the WordNet synsets that are synonymous to perspicuity and\nperspicuous shows that the semicolon groups and the synsets organized around these two\nwords can be quite similar. The content of the Head is the following:\nChapter 6. Finding the Hidden Treasures in the Thesaurus\n71\nThe synsets containing the synonyms of perspicuity and perspicuous are:\nThe synonym synsets do not contain all of the words and phrases in the Head, even though 94%\nof these are contained in WordNet. This is an indication that the semantic relations that link the\nsemicolon groups in a paragraph extend beyond synonymy. This is further discussed in section\n6.3.\nChapter 6. Finding the Hidden Treasures in the Thesaurus\n72\nBoth lexical resources are comparable in size, but WordNet\u2019s 111,223 synsets are almost double\nthe 59,877 semicolon groups in the ELKB. Only 1,431 semicolon groups and synsets are\nidentical, 916 consist of one word or phrase, 459 of two, 51 of three, 4 of four and 1 of five\nwords and phrases. The common sets of four or more words are:\n\u2022 {compass, grasp, range, reach} \u2022 {ease, relaxation, repose, rest} \u2022 {escape, leak, leakage, outflow} \u2022 {fourfold, quadruple, quadruplex, quadruplicate} \u2022 {coronach, dirge, lament, requiem, threnody}\nSemicolon groups contain on average 3.75 words and phrases, synsets 1.76. This may indicate\nthat synsets represent a much more focused concept than semicolon groups even though both are\ndefined as sets of closely related words. The next section investigates a technique for matching\nsemicolon groups to synsets.\n6.2 Combining Roget\u2019s and WordNet\nThe semicolon group and the synset represent the smallest independent unit of Roget's and\nWordNet. Although not identical, these groups can be compared and linked. Kwong (1998, 2001)\nproposes an algorithm for aligning WordNet noun synsets with their equivalent noun sense in the\n1987 edition of Penguin\u2019s Roget\u2019s Thesaurus. A sense in Roget\u2019s is defined by a noun and its\nlocation within a specific semicolon group, paragraph and head. The following steps describe my\nvariant of Kwong\u2019s algorithm:\nStep 0: Take an index item W from Roget\u2019s index. For example, the word desk is an index item in:\ndesk\ncabinet 194 n. stand 218 n. classroom 539 n.\nStep 1: In Roget\u2019s, find all paragraphs Pm such that W \u2208 Pm.\nStep 2: In WordNet, build all mini-nets Mn for W. A mini-net consists of a synset Sn such that W\n\u2208 Sn with its corresponding hypernym synsets Hyp(Sn), and coordinate synsets Co(Sn). The coordinate synsets represent the immediate hypernyms of the synset as well as the hypernyms\u2019\nimmediate hyponyms. This is done to compare similar structures in both resources and to ensure\nenough lexical material to calculate a significant overlap.\nChapter 6. Finding the Hidden Treasures in the Thesaurus\n73\nStep 3: Compute a similarity score matrix A for the WordNet mini-nets and the Roget\u2019s paragraphs. A similarity score Ajk is computed for the j th WordNet mini-net and the kth Roget\u2019s\nparagraph, according to the following formula:\nAjk = \u03b11|Sj \u2229 Pk| + \u03b12|Hyp(Sj) \u2229 Pk| + \u03b13|Co(Sj) \u2229 Pk|\nKwong sets \u03b11 = \u03b12 = \u03b13 = 1. These weights are reasonable as it seems that no one relation is more important than another. The procedure uses lemmata when comparing words but does not\nlemmatize elements of phrases.\nStep 4: Find the global maximum max(Ajk) of the matrix A. The jth WordNet mini-net can be aligned with the kth Roget\u2019s Thesaurus paragraph found in the maximum intersection.\nKwong (ibid.) takes a WordNet synset and assigns a Roget\u2019s sense to it. The system maps 18,000\nnoun synsets onto 30,000 senses. She gives the following statement regarding accuracy:\n\u201cAlthough it had been difficult and impractical to check the mappings \u2026 exhaustively given the\nhuge amount of data, extensive sampling of the results showed that over 70% of the mappings\nare expected to be accurate\u201d. We have not verified this precision value.\nNastase and Szpakowicz (2001) have implemented a procedure that links WordNet semicolon\ngroups to Roget\u2019s senses for all parts-of-speech. As the same complement of semantic relations\nis not available to all parts-of-speech in WordNet, different ones must be used for building mini-\nnets:\n\u2022 using nouns: synonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms, meronyms and holonyms;\n\u2022 using adjectives and adverbs: synonyms;\n\u2022 using words that are derived from another word w: the information pertaining to the word w, according to its part-of-speech.\nThe precision of this algorithm is 57% when applied to the various parts-of-speech,\ncomparatively to Kwong\u2019s 70% for nouns. We have not implemented much of this algorithm\nusing the ELKB due to the large amount of data which makes it very time consuming to evaluate.\nThe task of aligning semicolon groups with synsets is more complicated as this mapping is\nmany-to-many. Daud\u00e9 et al. (2001) map WordNet 1.5 synsets onto WordNet 1.6 synsets using\nrelaxation labeling. Their technique is very effective, but it relies on the structure imposed by the\nsemantic relations. This mapping cannot be simply translated to align Roget\u2019s semicolon groups\nonto WordNet synsets as no explicit semantic relations are given in the Thesaurus. Without\nfurther experiments, it is difficult to assess the feasibility of this algorithm.\nChapter 6. Finding the Hidden Treasures in the Thesaurus\n74\n6.3 Importing Semantic Relations from WordNet into Roget\u2019s\nRoget\u2019s lacks explicitly labelled semantic relations. Chapter 4 has shown that its structure can be\nexploited to measure semantic similarity effectively, but having labeled semantic relations allows\nto further untangling the rich information contained in the paragraphs. This can be illustrated by\nexamining the first paragraph of the Head 276 Aircraft. The hyponym and meronym relations\nused by WordNet are clearly present, as well as the notions of \u201cscience of aircraft\u201d,\n\u201ctesting of an aircraft\u201d, as well as \u201cplaces where an aircraft can land\u201d:\nNastase and Szpakowicz (ibid.) have found empirically the hypernym relation to be prevalent\nbetween the keyword and the other phrases that make up a paragraph. Cassidy (2000) has\nidentified 400 semantic relations in the 1911 edition of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus. Some of these\nrelations are: is-caused-by, is-performed-by, has-consequence, is-measured-by, is-job-\nof. Cassidy\u2019s work is done manually. An alternative to this is to align paragraphs and mini-nets\nand label the relations automatically. The paragraph for the noun decrement illustrates the\nprocedure:\nChapter 6. Finding the Hidden Treasures in the Thesaurus\n75\nThe mini-net for the noun decrement can be built in the following way:\nOverview of noun decrement The noun decrement has 2 senses:\n1. decrease, decrement -- (the amount by which something decreases) 2. decrease, decrement -- (a process of becoming smaller)\nSynonyms/Hypernyms of noun decrement:\nSense 1 - decrease, decrement: {amount} Sense 2 - decrease, decrement: {process}\nHyponyms of noun decrement:\nSense 1 - decrease, decrement: {drop, fall}, {shrinkage} Sense 2 - decrease, decrement: {wastage}, {decay, decline}, {slippage}, {decline, diminution}, {desensitization, de sensitisation}, {narrowing}\nCoordinate Terms of noun decrement:\nBy matching semicolon groups and synsets where at least one word or phrase is in common, it is\npossible to rearrange the Roget\u2019s paragraph in the following manner:\nN. decrement\nHyponym: deduction, depreciation, cut 37 diminution; refund, shortage, slippage, defect 307 shortfall, 636 insufficiency;\nChapter 6. Finding the Hidden Treasures in the Thesaurus\n76\nThis algorithm only allows for discovering the WordNet relations that are present in Roget\u2019s.\nLearning the relations labeled by Cassidy and using machine learning techniques (O\u2019Hara and\nWiebe, 2003) would expose more clearly the richness of the Thesaurus. This has yet to be\nattempted using the ELKB.\n6.4 Augmenting WordNet with Information contained in Roget\u2019s\nSemicolon groups are organized around subjects in Roget\u2019s whereas synsets are linked by the\nclosed set of semantic relations in WordNet. Fellbaum (1998, p.10) calls this particularity of\nWordNet the Tennis Problem and describes it in the following manner: \u201c\u2026 WordNet does not\nlink racquet, ball, and net in a way that would show that these words, and the concepts behind\nthem, are part of another concept that can be expressed by court game.\u201d George Miller has\npromised that this will be corrected in WordNet 2.0. Roget\u2019s Thesaurus can help in this task. It\ncontains the paragraph ball game in the Head 837 Amusement:\nThis paragraph contains rackets, ball game and netball, similar words to racquet, ball and\nnet. A native English speaker can make the connection. This example illustrates that the\norganization of Roget\u2019s lexical material is quite different than that of WordNet\u2019s, that WordNet\nwould benefit from Roget\u2019s topical clustering and that adding such links automatically is not a\ntrivial task. Stevenson (2001) considers that synsets can be linked using a new relationship when\nChapter 6. Finding the Hidden Treasures in the Thesaurus\n77\na Roget\u2019s paragraph has a strong overlap with three or more synsets. He links 24,633 WordNet\nsynsets to 3,091 Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus (Chapman, 1977) paragraphs. These figures\nrepresent almost 25% of WordNet synsets and 50% of ELKB paragraphs in terms of absolute\nnumbers, which suggests that augmenting WordNet in this manner is a promising avenue of\nresearch.\n6.5 Other Techniques for Improving the ELKB\nKwong (1998) has shown that it is possible to obtain a mapping between LDOCE and Roget\u2019s\nThesaurus using WordNet. Although Kwong only performs this experiment on a small set of 36\nnouns, the idea of incorporating information contained in LDOCE into Roget\u2019s is very attractive.\nLDOCE contains definition and frequency information that is very beneficial. Researchers have\nalso proven it to be a valuable resource for NLP. The ELKB that would contain definitions,\nfrequency information as well as a set of labeled semantic relations is very close to the holy grail\nof computational lexicography: \u201ca neutral, machine-tractable, dictionary\u201d (Wilks et al., 1996).\nChapter 7. Summary, Discussion, and Future Work\n78"}, {"heading": "7 Summary, Discussion, and Future Work", "text": "This chapter summarizes the contributions of the thesis and presents known flaws of the ELKB,\naspects that should be improved and ideas for future applications."}, {"heading": "7.1 Summary", "text": "The goal of this thesis was to establish if Roget\u2019s Thesaurus can be a realistic alternative to\nWordNet. To achieve this, various sub-goals had to be met. The first is the design and\nimplementation of the ELKB; next I performed NLP experiments whose results are compared to\nthose of WordNet-based systems. The thesis also contains a quantitative comparison of both\nlexical knowledge bases.\nChapter 1 presents the context, goals and organization of this thesis.\nChapter 2 gives a brief history of how computational linguists have used thesauri in NLP. It\ndiscusses the various versions of Roget\u2019s and explains the rationale for choosing the 1987 edition\nof Penguin\u2019s Roget\u2019s Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases as the source for the ELKB. This\nchapter also discusses several applications of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus and WordNet in NLP.\nChapter 3 discusses the design of the ELKB as well as its implementation. It shows the necessary\nsteps to transform the computer-readable Pearson Education files into a tractable form. This\ninvolves converting the lexical material into a format that can be more easily exploited,\nidentifying data structures and classes to computerize the Thesaurus, indexing all of the words\nand phrases in the resource and ensuring that they can be retrieved even when the exact string is\nnot supplied. I explain in detail Roget\u2019s organization and contrast it with WordNet\u2019s. The\nimplementation verifies the accuracy of the design and ensures that Roget\u2019s functionality is\nfaithfully reproduced by the ELKB.\nChapter 4 explains how Roget\u2019s Thesaurus can be used to measure semantic distance. Using\nthree well known benchmarks for the evaluation of semantic similarity, I correlate the similarity\nvalues calculated by the ELKB and six WordNet-based measures with those assigned by human\njudges. Roget\u2019s gets scores of over .80 for two of the three benchmarks, quite close to those\nobtained when the experiments are replicated using humans. The system outperforms the\nWordNet-based measures most of the time. The chapter presents a second class of experiments,\nwhere the correct synonym must be selected amongst a group of four words. These are taken\nfrom ESL, TOEFL and Readers\u2019 Digest questions. The ELKB is compared to the same WordNet-\nChapter 7. Summary, Discussion, and Future Work\n79\nbased measures as well as to statistical methods. The ELKB outperforms all systems that do not\nrely on combined approaches, obtaining scores in the 80% range.\nChapter 5 explains how lexical chains can be built using the ELKB. It presents the necessary\ndesign decisions for automating the chain building procedure by walking through the algorithm\nthat has been used for all implementations. I compare the lexical chains the ELKB constructs to\nthose built manually by the inventors of lexical chains, automatically using a partially\ncomputerized Roget\u2019s Thesaurus and a WordNet-based system. This chapter discusses several\nevaluation procedures, in particular one in which the lexical chains are compared to summaries\nof texts.\nChapter 6 describes steps for combining Roget\u2019s and WordNet. It shows some of the rich\nimplicit semantic relations that are found in the Thesaurus. I explain how WordNet can enrich\nRoget\u2019s and vice-versa, as well as present an algorithm for aligning both resources.\nChapter 7 presents a summary of the dissertation. It discusses known flaws as of the ELKB as\nwell as future extensions and applications."}, {"heading": "7.2 Conclusions", "text": "This dissertation has shown that it is possible to computerize Roget\u2019s Thesaurus so that it\nmaintains all of the functionality of the printed version and allows for manipulations suitable for\nNLP applications. I have used the ELKB in a few experiments, but these are not enough to\ndetermine if it is a credible alternative to WordNet. I offer a few ideas for those who intend to use\nthe ELKB or want to build a similar knowledge base.\n7.2.1 Building an ELKB from an Existing Lexical Resource\nBuilding an ELKB from an existing lexical resource is a very attractive proposition. A\ncomputational linguist can save much time by exploiting the structure and lexical material\ncontained in existing dictionaries and thesauri. I have encountered two major problems when\nimplementing the ELKB. The lexicographer\u2019s directives are not known and it is very tedious to\ncomprehend the organization of paragraphs and semicolon groups without having specific\nexplanations for the underlying decisions. Implementing the ELKB would have been much\nsimpler had the editor\u2019s instructions for the preparation of the Roget\u2019s Thesaurus been available.\nThe next problem is that the lexical material must be licensed from the publisher for a\nconsiderable price. This hinders the public acceptance of the ELKB as most research groups are\nunwilling to spend money on an unproven resource.\nChapter 7. Summary, Discussion, and Future Work\n80\n7.2.2 Comparison of the ELKB to WordNet\nThe ELKB is comparable to WordNet in many ways. It contains a similar number of words and\nphrases and this thesis has shown that they both can be used for the same tasks. Although they\nare similar, this dissertation demonstrates that their organization is quite different. The ELKB\ndraws on the 150 years that lexicographers have taken to prepare the Thesaurus. Pearson\u2019s\npublishes a new edition roughly every ten years. The ELKB lacks the support of the NLP\ncommunity which WordNet has. WordNet is slightly more than ten years old, new versions are\nreleased about every two years. Version 2.0 promises to correct many flaws that are discussed in\nthis dissertation. Several research groups work independently from George Miller\u2019s to enhance\nthis lexical resource. Its prevalence is not only due to its quality but largely also to the fact that it\nis free.\n7.2.3 Using the ELKB for NLP Experiments\nThis thesis has used the ELKB to measure semantic similarity between words and phrases and to\nbuild lexical chains. I have been able to perform these experiments with ease using the Java\nimplementations. These two applications can be integrated into larger systems, for example one\nthat performs Text Summarization or Question Answering tasks. The ELKB has also been used\nin two computer science honors projects. Gilles Roy and Pierre Chr\u00e9tien created a graphical user\ninterface for the Thesaurus, Tad Stach wrote a program to play the Reader\u2019s Digest Word Power\nGame. The ELKB must be used in more experiments to test the software thoroughly.\n7.2.4 Known Errors in the ELKB\nThe ELKB still contains errors, mostly in its lexical material. These are often due to the mistakes\ncontained in the original Pearson files. I estimate that about 2% - 3% of the words and phrases in\nthe ELKB are incorrect. Although this percentage is small, it is enough to be noticed and\nadversely affect future applications.\n7.2.5 Improvements to the ELKB\nThe computerized Roget\u2019s Thesaurus that I have implemented is far from being the perfect\nlexical knowledge base. Many improvements can be made to the software."}, {"heading": "7.2.5.1 Retrieval of Phrases", "text": "The ELKB does not perform any morphological transformations when looking up a phrase. If a\nuser does not supply the exact string contained in the Index, no result will be returned. For\nexample, the phrase \u201csixty four thousand dollar question\u201d will not be found because the\nChapter 7. Summary, Discussion, and Future Work\n81\nexact string in the ELKB is \u201cthe sixty-four-thousand-dollar question\u201d. Giving access to\nall of Roget\u2019s phrases is a difficult problem to solve but is one that merits attention. The\nThesaurus contains many phrases, some of them very peculiar, for example: \u201cCheshire cat\ngrin\u201d, \u201cHomeric laughter\u201d or \u201cwisest fool in Christendom\u201d. It is possibly an area where\nthe ELKB is superior to WordNet. I have not investigated this. An ideal solution would be to\nintegrate in the Index a method that could extract all phrases that contain certain words. Also,\nmorphological transformations would have to be performed on all words in a phrase to find the\nform contained in the Thesaurus. An imperfect solution that I have adopted for the ELKB is to\nindex all two word phrases under each of the words. Although this improves the recall of\nphrases, it introduces many odd references for index entries. For example, the phrase fish food\nis now indexed under fish and food. The ELKB determines that the distance between food and\nrooster is 4, meaning that the words are quite similar, when the intuitive association is not that\nstrong. The system is finding the shortest path between all references of food and rooster,\nwhich happens to be between fish food and rooster, found in two different noun paragraphs\nof the head 365 Animality. Animal. When the phrase fish food is ignored, the distance\nbetween food and rooster is 10."}, {"heading": "7.2.5.2 Displaying the Semicolon Group Which Contains a Variant of the Search Word", "text": "As described in Chapter 3, when a word is looked up, morphological transformations are\nperformed to find all matching entries that are contained in the Index. For example, when a user\nenters the word tire, the ELKB finds the words tire and tyre in the Index. The reference for\ntyre is wheel 250 N. The system finds the Head 250 Circularity: simple circularity,\nand locates the wheel noun paragraph. The ELKB searches the paragraph sequentially until the\nword tire is found. Since tyre is the word contained in the paragraph, the correct semicolon\ngroup is not returned. This causes a slight problem when calculating semantic distance. For\nexample, the system determines the distance between the words hub and tire to be 2 instead of\n0 as the words do not appear in the semicolon group ;hub, felloe, felly, tyre;. This is not\ndifficult to correct, but awkward, so I left it as one of a number of future adjustments."}, {"heading": "7.2.5.3 Original vs. New Index", "text": "The ELKB uses an Index that is generated from all of the words and phrases that it contains.\nPearson Education supplies an Index that is about half the size of the automatically generated\none. The system stores the two in separate files that cannot be used at the same time.

Future releases must improve memory\nusage and speed if this resource is to be a viable alternative to WordNet. Performance can be\nimproved by loading the text of the 990 Heads into memory and storing absolute references to\nParagraphs and semicolon groups, as described in Chapter 3. The current implementation loads\nin 3 seconds on a Pentium 4, 2.40 GHz with 256 MB of RAM, and requires about 40 MB of\nRAM."}, {"heading": "7.3 Future Work", "text": "The ultimate goal of this research should be to make the ELKB available to any research group\nthat requests it. Beyond the fact that the lexical material must be licensed, future maintainers of\nthe system should thoroughly evaluate the ELKB and use it in a wide variety of applications so as\nto attract the interest of the NLP community. It should also be enhanced to make it more\ncompetitive with regards to WordNet.\n7.3.1 More Complete Evaluation of the ELKB\nThis dissertation has performed a partial evaluation of the ELKB by comparing it to WordNet-\nbased systems and statistical techniques. A comparison to other versions of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus,\nnamely the 1911 edition, FACTOTUM and Roget\u2019s International Thesaurus should be carried\nout. Until this is done, I cannot say how good this version of Roget\u2019s is compared to all others.\nFuture research should perform further benchmark experiments with the ELKB, namely Word\nSense Disambiguation. This is a problem that has a long history in NLP and for which thesauri\nhave been used (Ide and V\u00e9ronis, 1998)."}, {"heading": "7.3.2 Extending the Applications Presented in the Thesis", "text": "Turney (2002) has used his semantic similarity metric to classify automobile and movie reviews.\nBigham et al. (2003) use their similarity metric to answer analogy problems. In an analogy\nproblem, the correct pair of words must be chosen amongst four pairs, for example: cat:meow::\n(a) mouse:scamper, (b) bird:peck, (c) dog:bark, (d) horse:groom, (e) lion:scratch. To\ncorrectly answer dog:bark, a system must know that a meow is the sound that a cat makes and\na bark the sound that a dog makes. Both of these applications can be implemented with the\nELKB.\nAs discussed in Chapter 5, several researchers have used lexical chains for Text Summarization,\nmost notably Barzilay and Elhadad (1997) as well as Silber and McCoy (2000). Since I have\nChapter 7. Summary, Discussion, and Future Work\n83\nimplemented a system that can build lexical chains, it would be very interesting to put it to this\ntask.\n7.3.3 Enhancing the ELKB\nChapter 6 describes several enhancements to the ELKB. If I had combined Roget\u2019s with\nWordNet, labeled the implicit semantic relations and included frequency information as well as\ndictionary definitions from LDOCE, the ELKB would be one of the premier lexical resources for\nNLP.\nChapter 8.

The keyword is given to identify the paragraph which contains the word you have looked up; it also gives and indication of the ideas contained in that paragraph, so it can be used as a clue where a word has several meanings and therefire several references.\" An example of an Index Entry is:\nstork obstetrics 167 n. bird 365 n.\nIn this example stork is an Index Item and obstetrics 167 n. is a Reference.

It has been accepted and used extensively by computational<lb>linguists ever since it was released. Some of its applications include information retrieval,<lb>language generation, question answering, text categorization, text classification and word sense<lb>disambiguation. Inspired by WordNet's success, we propose as an alternative a similar resource,<lb>based on the 1987 Penguin edition of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases. Peter Mark Roget published his first Thesaurus over 150 years ago. Countless writers, orators<lb>and students of the English language have used it. Computational linguists have employed<lb>Roget\u2019s for almost 50 years in Natural Language Processing. Some of the tasks they have used it<lb>for include machine translation, computing lexical cohesion in texts and constructing databases<lb>that can infer common sense knowledge. This dissertation presents Roget\u2019s merits by explaining<lb>what it really is and how it has been used, while comparing its applications to those of WordNet.<lb>The NLP community has hesitated in accepting Roget\u2019s Thesaurus because a proper machine-<lb>tractable version was not available. This dissertation presents an implementation of a machine-tractable version of the 1987 Penguin<lb>edition of Roget\u2019s Thesaurus \u2013 the first implementation of its kind to use an entire current<lb>edition. It explains the steps necessary for taking a machine-readable file and transforming it into<lb>a tractable system. This involves converting the lexical material into a format that can be more<lb>easily exploited, identifying data structures and designing classes to computerize the Thesaurus.<lb>Roget\u2019s organization is studied in detail and contrasted with WordNet\u2019s. We show two applications of the computerized Thesaurus: computing semantic similarity<lb>between words and phrases, and building lexical chains in a text. The experiments are performed<lb>using well-known benchmarks and the results are compared to those of other systems that use<lb>Roget\u2019s, WordNet and statistical techniques. Roget\u2019s has turned out to be an excellent resource<lb>for measuring semantic similarity; lexical chains are easily built but more difficult to evaluate.<lb>We also explain ways in which Roget\u2019s Thesaurus and WordNet can be combined.
