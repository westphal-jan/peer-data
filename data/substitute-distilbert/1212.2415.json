In this section, we consider previous works which were proposed to suppress the influence of illumination variation in feature-based face recognition.\nFace recognition based on the local information such as Gabor wavelet features in feature points has advantage that recognition is not sensitive to the variation of head pose or illumination, compared to the holistic based recognition such as Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces, ICA(Independent Component Analysis) and HMM(Hidden Markov Model) [4-7]. Different models and methods were proposed to support local feature-based face recognition, such as AAM(Active Appearance Model), LBP(Local Binary Pattern) and EBGM(Elastic Bunch Graph Matching) [8-18]. AAM is a geometrical and statistical model of face image, which is obtained by applying PCA or LDA to feature vectors consisting of coordinate and gray level intensity of feature points. LBP is a method to represent face image using binary vectors corresponding to each pixel, which are constructed by comparing pixel value of each pixel enclosing a pixel with the value of center pixel. Many training data and time are needed to construct AAM or LBP-based classifier.\nEBGM is a matching method using Gabor wavelet features extracted from the face graph reflecting topological structure of human faces, where face graph is constructed by connecting landmarks (node) of face with edges [14].

EBGM-based face recognition has drawback that estimation of landmarks and extraction of Gabor wavelet coefficients are influenced by the illumination variation. To overcome such a weakness of EBGM, some researchers tried to develop techniques which can decrease the effect of illumination variation by applying normalization or DCT(Discrete Cosine Transform) to the input image [16-18]. However, it is still difficult to remove the effect of local illumination variation simultaneously with global illumination, though their methods make it possible to suppress the effect of global illumination variation to a certain degree.\nIn this paper, we introduce a method extracting Gabor wavelet features and discriminant feature points from face image, which is robust against local illumination variation and shows high recognition efficiency. FERET and YaleB are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods."}, {"heading": "2 Extraction of Robust Gabor Wavelet Features", "text": "In this section, we describe a method extracting Gabor wavelet features from face images, which is robust against local illumination variation.

Gj(\u2212\u2192x ) can be calculated as shown in Eq.2 by considering the fact that Gj(\u2212\u2192x ) only depends on the points belonging to the neighborhood Dj(\u2212\u2192x ) of \u2212\u2192x from the property of kernel function \u03a8j and the characteristics of the calculation of Gabor wavelet coefficients.\nGj(\u2212\u2192x ) = \u222b Dj( \u2212\u2192x ) I(\u2212\u2192x \u2032 )\u03a8j(\u2212\u2192x \u2212\u2212\u2192x \u2032 )d2\u2212\u2192x \u2032 (2)\nDj(\u2212\u2192x ) is a small area compared to the input face image and therefore we can assume that gray level intensity of face image changes linearly according to the brightness and contrast of illumination in this area, i.e.,\nI(\u2212\u2192x \u2032 ) = \u03b1bj(\u2212\u2192x ) + \u03b1cj(\u2212\u2192x ) \u00b7 I \u2032 Dj( \u2212\u2192x )( \u2212\u2192x \u2032 ), (\u2212\u2192x \u2032 \u2208 Dj(\u2212\u2192x )) (3)\nHere, \u03b1bj(\u2212\u2192x ) and \u03b1cj(\u2212\u2192x ) are the average and standard deviation of gray level intensity in local area Dj(\u2212\u2192x ), and express brightness and contrast of illumination.

By using Gj0(\u2212\u2192x ) as the Gabor wavelet coefficients instead of Gj(\u2212\u2192x ), we can achieve the effect of normalization of local illumination variation.

Linear discriminant analysis is a method to find out subspace in which the separability of classes becomes maximum, where the separability of classes is defined as the ratio of between-class variation to within-class variation [20-23]. It can be considered that the points having big separability of classes\nare the most discriminant points when selecting feature point. We calculate separability of classes using Gabor wavelet coefficient vector g(\u2212\u2192x ) for each point and select the points whose separability of classes are big as feature points for the extraction of jet. Here, Gabor wavelet coefficients only use magnitude and neglect phase component, i.e., g(\u2212\u2192x ) = (|Gj0(\u2212\u2192x )|)mj=0.\nLet S\u0302W (\u2212\u2192x ) and S\u0302b(\u2212\u2192x ) be the within-class/between-class scatter matrix by considering feature vector g(\u2212\u2192x ) of fixed point \u2212\u2192x as a random vector. Then, the value J\u0302(\u2212\u2192x ) of the separability of classes for each \u2212\u2192x \u2208 X \u00d7 Y is calculated as follows [20].\nJ\u0302(\u2212\u2192x ) = tr(S\u0302b( \u2212\u2192x ))\ntr(S\u0302W (\u2212\u2192x )) (6)\nWe select PF = {\u2212\u2192x 1, ...,\u2212\u2192x N |J\u0302(\u2212\u2192x i) > \u03b50, i = 1, ..., N} as the candidate set for feature points, where \u03b50 is a threshold. Absolute value |Gj0(\u2212\u2192x )| of Gabor wavelet coefficient does not change largely in the neighborhood of \u2212\u2192x and thus correlation between feature vectors becomes large and value of J\u0302(\u2212\u2192x ) becomes similar. This implies that the points of PF are mainly placed in the neighborhoods of extreme points of the function J\u0302(\u2212\u2192x ) : X \u00d7 Y \u2192 R. To increase recognition rate, however, it is important not only to select feature points having big separability of classes but also to make the correlation between feature vectors small as possible. Thus, we finally select the points from PF , which have a less correlation each other, using correlation between feature vectors and k-means clustering algorithm. Selection algorithm is describe below.\nLet q(1 < q < N), l and c denote the number of groups, the number of step and the maximum repeat count. Let P (l) k (k = 1, ..., q) be the k-th group in step l. Here, P (l) k \u2282 PF .

Step2: Reassign points \u2212\u2192x i(i = 1, ..., N) to group P (l)ki . Here, ki is decided as\nfollows.\nki = argmaxjsij , sij = s(\u2212\u2192x i, P (l)k ) = E{ < g(\u2212\u2192x i), g(x(l)j ) >\n||g(\u2212\u2192x i)|| \u00b7 ||g(x(l)j || } (7)\nStep3: If l < c and there is a point \u2212\u2192x i(1 \u2264 i \u2264 N) which is reassigned, then increase l one and recalculate x\n(l) k and go to step 2. The center x (l) k of group P (l) k\nis calculated using the equation described below, where P (l) k = {\u2212\u2192x i,1, ...,\u2212\u2192x i,qk}.\nx (l) k =\n\u03a3qkj=1j\u0302( \u2212\u2192x k,j) \u00b7 \u2212\u2192x k,j\n\u03a3qkj=1j\u0302( \u2212\u2192x k,j)\n(8)\nStep4 : If the above condition is not satisfied, then P \u2032 F = {xli, ..., x (l) q } is the\nset of feature points.

For the experiment, 128\u00d7128 image extracted from the image where the position of eyes are given. The sum of similarities between jets is used as the similarity for performance estimation [14].\nTable 1 shows the recognition performance according to the number of feature points, when the method of paper is applied. As we can see in the table, recognition performance does not increase when the number of feature points is greater than 50.\nTable 2 shows the result of comparison between the method of paper and EGBM in case that the number of feature points is 50. As we can know from the table, it is possible to remove performance degradation which is caused by the incorrect extraction of feature points under serious illumination variation (YaleB), if we apply the method of paper. However, if we fix landmark, the performance is decreased in case that there is no serious illumination variation.\nTable 3 shows recognition performances in case that we use Gj(\u2212\u2192x ) and Gj0(\u2212\u2192x ) as wavelet feature coefficients respectively.
