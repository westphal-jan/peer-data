INTRODUCTION\nThe knowledge bases (KBs) contain a large amount of information coming from different sources. KBs must be able to \u201cintelligently\u201d manage such distributed information. An important task is ensuring that those KBs, comprising collections of information which possibly conflict with each other, need to be combined into a consistent whole ([1]). As one of traditional ways of management, belief merging concerns with the problem of determining a group\u2019s beliefs from individual members\u2019 beliefs ([2], [3]). The merging process from the point of logic is formalize as follows: let \u03a6 = {\u03d51, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03d5n} be a group of KBs (which is composed of multiple formulae and can also be taken as conjunction of them from logic equivalence) where each logical formula \u03d5i denotes a knowledge base(KB) from some information source. \u03a6 is a multi-set of formulae which is to merge. \u00b5 is a set of formulae which represents the integrity constraints, i.e., some information that the result of merging must obey. The goal of merging is to obtain a new KB \u25b3\u00b5(\u03a6) which represents the consensus of n sources given integrity constraints \u00b5 ([4]).\nWhen conflicts occur in KBs, we intuitively weaken them to achieve consistency again. Thus we can avoid the trivialization of inference that everything can be deducted from inconsistent KBs. Of course, a fundamental requirement is to minimize changes of the original KBs in maintaining their consistency. That is, the information of the original KBs should be preserved as much as possible. Those current approaches are based on two fundamentally different standpoints: the syntaxbased and the semantics-based. Based on syntax, the maximal consistent subsets of the original bases consistent with the integrity are selected as the merged result. Unfortunately, the\ncommon weakness is that the merged results depend on the syntax forms of KBs. Based on semantics (models), those models which have the minimal distance to models of the KBs are selected from the models of integrity constraints as the candidates models of the merged result. The Dalal distance has been proved a useful way to characterize two models ([5]). Based on three methods of aggregating distances of multi-KBs, there are three merging operators, namely, \u25b3\u03a3\u00b5 , \u25b3 Max \u00b5 and \u25b3 GMax \u00b5 . \u25b3 \u03a3 \u00b5 is taking the summation of distances as the aggregation to pick out the most popular models ([6]). \u25b3Max\u00b5 is taking the maximum of distances as the aggregation to minimize the worst cases ([7]). \u25b3GMax\u00b5 is based on lexicographical order to capture the arbitration behavior of operator \u25b3Max\u00b5 ([2]).\nHowever, three existing merging operators do not always work well in some cases. We still consider an example of swimming-pool discussed in [2] previously. Swimming-pool At a meeting of a block of flat co-owners, the chairman proposes for the coming year the construction of a swimming-pool, of a tennis-court and of a private-car-park. But if two of these three items are built, the rent will significantly increase. We will denote by S, T, P respectively the construction of the swimming-pool, the tennis-court and the private-car-park. We denote I the rent increase. The chairman outlines that building two items or more will have an important impact on the rent: \u00b5 = ((S \u2227 T )\u2228 (S \u2227 P )\u2228 (T \u2227 P )) \u2192 I .\nThere are four co-owners \u03a6 = {\u03d51, \u03d52, \u03d53, \u03d54}. Two of the co-owners want to build the three items and do not care about the rent increase: \u03d51 = \u03d52 = S \u2227 T \u2227 P . The third one thinks that building an item will cause at some time an increase of the rent and wants to pay the lowest rent, So he is opposed to any construction: \u03d53 = \u00acS \u2227 \u00acT \u2227 \u00acP \u2227 \u00acI . The last one thinks that the block really needs a tennis-court and a private-car-park but does not want a high rent increase: \u03d54 = T \u2227P \u2227\u00acI . In [2], the merging results of applying three operators above are in the following. \u25b3\u03a3\u00b5 (\u03a6) = S \u2227 T \u2227 P \u2227 I . \u25b3Max\u00b5 = (\u00acS \u2227\u00acT \u2227P )\u2228 (\u00acS \u2227 T\u00acP )\u2228 (S \u2227\u00acT \u2227P \u2227 I). \u25b3GMax\u00b5 = \u00acS \u2227 \u00acI \u2227 ((\u00acT \u2227 P ) \u2228 (T \u2227 \u00acP )).\nHowever, the results are not intuitive from the view of propositional symbols. For variable I , since \u03d51, \u03d52 don\u2019t care about it and \u03d53, \u03d54 support \u00acI , So the literal formula \u00acI can be regarded as the perspective of the whole group. For variables S, T, P , the former two owners and the third one\nhave different opinions. That is, the former two support S, T and P and the third one supports their opposite. So they don\u2019t reach consensus if no co-owner gives in. The formula \u00acI \u2227 \u00b5 is thus natural result for the merging. Moreover, \u25b3\u03a3\u00b5 (\u03a6) and \u25b3Max\u00b5 are not enough to capture \u00acI . on the other hand, although \u25b3GMax\u00b5 |= \u00acI , the operator is too strong since \u25b3GMax\u00b5 |= \u00acS. Two co-owners support S, one supports its opposite and one is neutral about S. We can\u2019t agree on \u00acS even if we don\u2019t follow the majority property. It is reasonable that S is taken as unknown, i.e., neither S nor \u00acS.\nIn general, inconsistencies occurring between KBs are caused by over-defining in representing something. The main idea of handling inconsistency is removing or ignoring those redundant information. As a significant approach to dealing with inconsistencies, forgetting is a useful tool to restrict variables to be discussed in a subset of variables of the original KBs with keeping logical equivalence locally ([9]).\nIn this paper, inspiring from [10], we present a novel approach based on variable forgetting to merging multi-KBs with maintaining consistency. First, we build the relationship between belief merging and variable forgetting by using the framework of dilation (presented in [3]). We then reformalize three classical merging operators via variable forgetting. Two new forgetting-based merging operators are obtained by modifying variables to be forgotten. We show that those forgettingbased merging operators can amend the shortage (discussed in the motivating example of \u201cswimming-pool\u201d) of classical operators.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a brief review of merging and forgetting for KBs. Section 3 employs forgetting to capture traditional merging operators. We develop three new merging operators by forgetting variables in Section 4. in the last section, we summarize this paper and put forward to some future works."}, {"heading": "II. PRELIMINARIES", "text": "In this section, we briefly review basic concepts of belief merging and forgetting for propositional KBs."}, {"heading": "A. Belief Merging", "text": "The propositional language, denoted by L, is constructed from a finite set P of symbols. \u22a4(true) and \u22a5(false) are boolean constants. In L, p denotes a propositional variable, \u03d5, \u03c8, \u00b5 propositional formula, \u03a6,\u03a61,\u03a62, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 sets of formulas. \u03a61\u222a\u03a62 is the union of sets \u03a61,\u03a62, and \u03a61\u2294\u03a62 is the union of multi-sets of sets \u03a61,\u03a62. V ar(\u03d5) denotes the set of variables which occur in \u03d5. An interpretation is a function from P to {0, 1}. \u03c9, \u03c9\u2032 denote interpretations. M is the collection of all interpretations. An interpretation is a model of formula iff it makes it true in classical way. mod(\u03d5) denotes the set of models of \u03d5. \u03d5 is consistent iff mod(\u03d5) 6= \u2205. \u03d5 \u2261 \u03c8 iff mod(\u03d5) = mod(\u03c8).\nThe aggregation of finite KBs into a collective one is studied by a recent discipline called belief merging (see [8], [2], [3]). A particular type of aggregation is called model-based merging. Intuitively, the model-based merging is aggregating\nthose models which are closer to models of every formula. In technique, it is choosing those models which have the minimal aggregating distance.\nLet \u03a6\u2032 = {\u03d5\u20321, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03d5 \u2032 n}, \u03a6 \u2194 \u03a6 \u2032 iff there is a bijection f : \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6\u2032 satisfying \u2200\u03d5i \u2208 \u03a6, \u03d5i \u2194 f(\u03d5i). |V | denotes the cardinal number of a set V . The (Dalal) distance between two models d(\u03c9, \u03c9\u2032) =| {p | \u03c9, \u03c9\u2032 assign differently on p} |. The distance between a model and formula is defined as d(\u03c9, \u03d5) = min\u03c9\u2032\u2208mod(\u03d5)d(\u03c9, \u03c9\u2032). \u03d5x\u21900(resp. \u03d5x\u21901) denotes the formula obtained by replacing in \u03d5 every occurrence of variables x by \u22a5(resp. \u22a4).

Let \u2264lex be the lexicographical order between sequences of integers. Then the pre-order \u2264GMax\u03a6 is defined as follows: \u03c9 \u2264 GMax \u03a6 \u03c9\n\u2032 iff L\u03a6\u03c9 \u2264lex L\u03a6\u03c9\u2032 .

So \u03c9 \u2208 mod(\u2203{p}.\u03d5) and \u03c9 \u2208 mod(\u2228p\u2208V ar(\u03d5)\u2203{p}.\u03d5). If d(\u03c9, \u03d5) = 1, then \u2203\u03c9\u2032 \u2208 mod(\u03d5) and d(\u03c9, \u03c9\u2032) = 1. So \u03c9, \u03c9\u2032 interpret the same except p in var(\u03d5). Thus \u03c9 \u2208 mod(\u2203{p}.\u03d5). Otherwise, if \u03c9 \u2208 mod(\u2228p\u2208V ar(\u03d5)\u2203{p}.\u03d5) then \u03c9 \u2208 mod(\u2203{p}.\u03d5) for some p. So d(\u03c9, \u03d5) \u2264 1 holds by the lemma.\n2. If 1 < n \u2264 |V ar(\u03d5)|, Then Dn(\u03d5) = D(Dn\u22121(\u03d5)). Suppose Dn\u22121(\u03d5) = \u2228V\u2286V ar(\u03d5),|V |=n\u22121\u2203V.\u03d5. And Dn(\u03d5) = D(\u2228V\u2286V ar(\u03d5),|V |=n\u22121\u2203V.\u03d5) = \u2228p\u2208V ar(\u03d5)\u2203{p}.(\u2228V\u2286V ar(\u03d5),|V |=n\u22121\u2203V.\u03d5) = \u2228V\u2286V ar(\u03d5),|V |=n\u2203V.\u03d5 \u2228 \u2228V\u2286V ar(\u03d5),|V |=n\u22121\u2203V.\u03d5 = \u2228V\u2286V ar(\u03d5),|V |=n\u2203V.\u03d5.\nThe last equation is because of a property of forgetting. Actually, Dn(\u03d5) = \u2228V\u2286V ar(\u03d5),|V |\u2264nforget(\u03d5, V ). And we can omit V \u2208 V ar(\u03d5) in subscript without confusion, i.e., Dn(\u03d5) = \u2228|V |\u2264nforget(\u03d5, V ).\n3. If n > |V ar(\u03d5)|, then mod(Dn(\u03d5)) = {\u03c9 \u2208 M|d(\u03c9, \u03d5) \u2264 n}. \u2203V ar(\u03d5).\u03d5 \u2261 \u22a4, then \u2200\u03c9 \u2208 M, then \u03c9 \u2208 mod(\u2203V ar(\u03d5).\u03d5). Thus d(\u03c9, \u03d5) \u2264 |V ar(\u03d5)| < n. So \u03c9 \u2208 mod(Dn(\u03d5)) and Dn(\u03d5) = \u22a4.\nSince the relationship between dilation and forgetting is pointed out, it\u2019s natural to represent these operators by forgetting.\nTheorem 2: Let \u03a6 = {\u03d51, \u03d52, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03d5n}. \u2022 \u25b3\u03a3\u00b5 (\u03a6) \u2261 \u2228|V1|+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+|Vn|=k(\u2203V1.\u03d51 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 \u2203Vn.\u03d5n \u2227 \u00b5). \u2022 \u25b3Max\u00b5 (\u03a6) \u2261 \u2228|V1|=\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7=|Vn|=k(\u2203V1.\u03d51\u2227\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2227\u2203Vn.\u03d5n\u2227\u00b5). \u2022 \u25b3GMax\u00b5 (\u03a6) = \u2228<|V1|,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,|Vn|>\u2208perm(T )(\u2203V1.\u03d51 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227\n\u2203Vn.\u03d5n \u2227 \u00b5).\nHere k and T are the same as above definitions.\nProof: We only prove the first equality and the others are similar. Let \u25b3\u03a3\u00b5 (\u03a6) \u2261 \u2228c1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+cn=k(D\nc1(\u03d51) \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 Dcn(\u03d5n) \u2227 \u00b5) and k is the least number that it is consistent. Then \u25b3\u03a3\u00b5 (\u03a6) \u2261 \u2228c1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+cn=k(\u2228|V1|=c1(\u2203V1.\u03d51) \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 \u2228|Vn|=cn(\u2203Vn.\u03d5n) \u2227 \u00b5) \u2261 \u2228c1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+cn=k(\u2228|V1|=c1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,|Vn|=cn(\u2203V1.\u03d51 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 \u2203Vn.\u03d5n \u2227 \u00b5) \u2261 \u2228|V1|+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+|Vn|=k(\u2203V1.\u03d51 \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2227 \u2203Vn.\u03d5n \u2227 \u00b5).\nA major difference between dilation and forgetting is that every variable has to be forgotten in dilation as it only find all the closest models to the original formula."}, {"heading": "IV. REVISED MERGING OPERATORS USING FORGETTING", "text": "The merging operators are represented by forgetting have the similar forms as by dilation. Since they have so close relationship that we can construct merging operators directly by forgetting. Our method is to revise the merging operators represented by forgetting to obtain some new ones which satisfy two new properties.\nTheorem 2 shows that forgotten variables for different knowledge bases might be distinct. Thus the result of conjunction after forgetting doesn\u2019t focus on a special domain. If we restrict every KB to forget the same set of variables, we get a new operator defined in this domain. Of course, we consider the minimal sets of variables to make the result of KBs after forgetting consistent.\nLiteral formulas might be regarded as the simplest sublanguage which is constructed on a single atom. In the face of literal formula query, all other variables needn\u2019t to be considered. As the motivating example presented in Section 1, on the one hand, if some information sources entail a literal formula, but the others say nothing about this atom, then the literal formula should hold for the group because they don\u2019t conflict with each other about this atom. On the other hand, if some sources agree on a literal formula, but some sources object to it, then it should be rejected. So our attitude to merging is more skeptical than before based on this point.\nNext we formalize such two properties. (A1) Let a KB \u03a6\u2032 \u2286 \u03a6 and l be a literal formula. Suppose \u00b5\u2227l is consistent. If \u2200\u03d5\u2032 \u2208 \u03a6\u2032, \u03d5\u2032 |= l and V ar(l) 6\u2208 V ar(\u03a6\u2212 \u03a6\u2032), then the merging result \u25b3\u00b5(\u03a6) |= l \u2227 \u00b5.\n(A2) Let \u03d51, \u03d52 \u2208 \u03a6. If \u03d51 |= l and \u03d52 |= \u00acl, then \u25b3\u00b5(\u03a6) 6|= l. The property (A2) implicitly requires that \u25b3\u00b5(\u03a6) 6|= \u00acl holds too.\nThough a KB \u03a6 is inconsistent w.r.t V ar(\u03a6), it may be consistent w.r.t some subset of V ar(\u03a6). We consider all these maximal subsets on set-inclusion or cardinal number and get two new operators in the following.\nDefinition 1: Let \u03a6 = {\u03d51, \u03d52, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03d5n} and \u00b5 be an integrity constraint. V \u2286 V ar(\u03a6), the collection of minimal variables sets for forgetting FS = {V is minimal w.r.t set cardinal | \u2227ni=1\u2203V.\u03d5i \u2227 \u00b5 consistent}. We define \u25b3 f1 \u00b5 as follows: \u25b3f1\u00b5 (\u03a6) = \u2228V \u2208FS(\u2227 n i=1\u2203V.\u03d5i \u2227 \u00b5).\nThe new operator satisfies (A1) and (A2). Before we prove the two properties above, we need the following lemma.\nLemma 2: Let p be variable in V , l be a literal formula on p. If \u22001 \u2264 i \u2264 n, \u03d5i |= l, and \u2227ni=1\u2203V.\u03d5i is consistent, then \u2227ni=1\u2203(V \u2212 {p}).\u03d5i is also consistent.\nProof: \u22001 \u2264 i \u2264 n, \u03d5i |= l, so we obtain \u2203(V \u2212 {p}).\u03d5i |= l. Let \u03c9 \u2208 mod(\u2227ni=1\u2203V.\u03d5i), then \u03c9 \u2208 mod(\u2203V.\u03d5i). If \u03c9 |= l then \u03c9 \u2208 mod(\u2203(V \u2212 {p}).\u03d5i), and \u03c9 \u2208 mod(\u2227ni=1\u2203(V \u2212{p}).\u03d5i). So it is consistent. If \u03c9 |= \u00acl, then there is a model \u03c9\u2032 \u2208 mod(\u2227ni=1\u2203V.\u03d5i) satisfying \u03c9 \u2032 and \u03c9 give the same truth value except p. It can be reduced to the first case and \u03c9\u2032 \u2208 mod(\u2227ni=1\u2203(V \u2212 {p}).\u03d5i). Thus \u2227ni=1\u2203(V \u2212 {p}).\u03d5i is also consistent.\nThe lemma indicates that the minimal forgetting set of variables doesn\u2019t comprise the variables on which all KBs agree. It can be easily extended to the general case that p doesn\u2019t occur in some bases and the other bases including it entail l.\nTheorem 3: \u25b3f1\u00b5 satisfies properties (A1), (A2). Proof: (A1) Let V \u2032 = V ar(\u03a6)\u2212{p}. If \u2200\u03d5\u2032 \u2208 \u03a6\u2032, \u03d5\u2032 |= p, then \u2200\u03d5\u2032 \u2208 \u03a6\u2032, \u2203V \u2032.\u03d5\u2032 |= p. So \u2203V \u2032.\u03d5\u2032 \u2261 p. And \u2200\u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6\u2212\u03a6\u2032, \u2203V \u2032.\u03d5 \u2261 \u22a4. Thus if \u00b5 6|= \u00acp then \u2227\u03d5\u2208\u03a6(\u2203V \u2032.\u03d5)\u2227\u00b5 \u2261 p \u2227 \u00b5 is consistent. In the definition of \u25b3f1\u00b5 , \u2200V \u2208 FS, p 6\u2208 V . Otherwise, V \u2212 {p} is minimal variables set such that \u2227\u03d5\u2208\u03a6(\u2203(V \u2212 {p}).\u03d5) \u2227 \u00b5 is consistent. Thus \u25b3f1\u00b5 (\u03a6) |= p.\n(A2) \u2200V \u2208 FS, p \u2208 V holds. Otherwise, suppose p 6\u2208 V . Let \u03d51 |= p and \u03d52 |= \u00acp. So \u2203V.\u03d51 |= p and \u2203V.\u03d52 |= \u00acp. \u2203V.\u03d51 \u2227 \u2203V.\u03d52 is inconsistent. V 6\u2208 FS. The property is proved.\nWe return to consider the motivating example. \u03d51(\u03d52) and \u03d53 assign contrary truth values on variables S, T, P . So they should forget these variables to preserve consistency. V = {S, T, P} is the only element in FS of definition above, \u25b3f1\u00b5 (\u03a6) = \u2227 4 i=1\u2203V.\u03d5i \u2227 \u00b5 = \u00acI \u2227 \u00b5 = \u00acI \u2227 (\u00acS \u2228 \u00acT ) \u2227 (\u00acS \u2228 \u00acP ) \u2227 (\u00acP \u2228 \u00acT ). Before we prepare to show properties of \u25b3f1\u00b5 , we first introduce an important lemma. Lemma 3: Let \u03d5, \u03d5\u2032 be two formulas and V a set of variables. We have d(\u2203V.\u03d5, \u03d5\u2032) = d(\u2203V.\u03d5, \u2203V.\u03d5\u2032). Proof: We prove first d(\u2203{p}.\u03d5, \u03d5\u2032) = d(\u2203{p}.\u03d5, \u2203{p}.\u03d5\u2032) for any atom p. Mod(\u03d5\u2032) \u2286 Mod(\u2203{p}.\u03d5\u2032), so d(\u2203{p}.\u03d5, \u2203{p}.\u03d5\u2032) \u2264 d(\u2203{p}.\u03d5, \u03d5\u2032). Take \u03c9 \u2208 Mod(\u2203{p}.\u03d5), \u03c9\u2032 \u2208 Mod(\u2203{p}.\u03d5\u2032), d(\u03c9, \u03c9\u2032) = d(\u2203{p}.\u03d5, \u2203{p}.\u03d5\u2032). There are four cases: 1. If \u03c9 \u2208Mod(\u03d5), \u03c9\u2032 \u2208Mod(\u03d5\u2032), then the equation holds. 2. If \u03c9 \u2208 Mod(\u03d5), \u03c9\u2032 \u2208 Mod(\u2203{p}.\u03d5\u2032) \u2212 Mod(\u03d5\u2032), let \u03c91, \u03c9\u20321 assign differently only on p with \u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032 respectively. Then d(\u03c91, \u03c9\u20321) = d(\u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032) and \u03c91 \u2208 Mod(\u2203{p}.\u03d5), \u03c9\u20321 \u2208 Mod(\u03d5 \u2032). So the equation holds. 3. If \u03c9 \u2208 Mod(\u2203{p}.\u03d5) \u2212Mod(\u03d5), \u03c9 \u2208 Mod(\u03d5\u2032), then the equation holds. 4. If \u03c9 \u2208 Mod(\u2203{p}.\u03d5) \u2212Mod(\u03d5), \u03c9\u2032 \u2208 Mod(\u2203{p}.\u03d5\u2032) \u2212 Mod(\u03d5\u2032), Let \u03c91, \u03c9\u20321 assign differently only on p with \u03c9, \u03c9\u2032 respectively. Then d(\u03c91, \u03c9\u20321) = d(\u03c9, \u03c9\n\u2032) and \u03c91 \u2208Mod(\u03d5), \u03c9\u20321 \u2208Mod(\u03d5\n\u2032). So the equation holds. Next we prove the general case for any set V (|V | > 1). Let\nV = {p1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , pn}. d(\u2203V.\u03d5, \u2203V.\u03d5\u2032)\n= d(\u2203{p1}.(\u2203(V \u2212 {p1}).\u03d5), \u2203{p1}.(\u2203(V \u2212 {p1}).\u03d5 \u2032)) = d(\u2203{p1}.(\u2203(V \u2212 {p1}).\u03d5), \u2203(V \u2212 {p1}).\u03d5\u2032) = d(\u2203V.\u03d5, \u2203(V \u2212 {p1}).\u03d5\u2032) = d(\u2203V.\u03d5, \u2203(V \u2212 {p1, p2}).\u03d5\n\u2032) = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = d(\u2203V.\u03d5, \u03d5\u2032).\nThis lemma shows d(\u2203V.\u03d5, \u03d5\u2032) = d(\u2203V.\u03d5\u2032, \u03d5). So \u2203V.\u03d5 is consistent with \u03d5\u2032 iff \u2203V.\u03d5\u2032 is consistent with \u03d5.\nIt\u2019s easy to see that for any V \u2032 \u2286 V , d(\u2203V.\u03d5, \u03d5\u2032) \u2261 d(\u2203V.\u03d5, \u2203V \u2032.\u03d5\u2032). But \u2203V.\u03d5 \u2227 \u03d5\u2032 \u2261 \u2203V.\u03d5 \u2227 \u2203V \u2032.\u03d5\u2032 doesn\u2019t hold. For example, \u03d5 \u2261 p\u2227q, \u03d5\u2032 \u2261 \u00acp. \u2203{p}.\u03d5\u2227\u03d5\u2032 \u2261 q\u2227\u00acp, but \u2203{p}.\u03d5 \u2227 \u2203{p}.\u03d5\u2032 \u2261 q.\nTheorem 4: \u25b3f1\u00b5 (\u03a6) satisfies postulates (IC0)-(IC4), (IC7), (IC8) and (MI).\nProof: 1. (IC0)-(IC3) obviously hold for \u25b3f1\u00b5 (\u03a6). 2. \u25b3f1\u00b5 (\u03d5 \u222a \u03d5\n\u2032) \u2227 \u03d5 = \u2228V \u2208FS(\u2203V.\u03d5 \u2227 \u2203V.\u03d5\u2032 \u2227 \u00b5) \u2227 \u03d5 = \u2228V \u2208FS(\u03d5\u2227\u2203V.\u03d5\u2032) and \u25b3f1\u00b5 (\u03d5\u222a\u03d5\n\u2032)\u2227\u03d5\u2032 = \u2228V \u2208FS(\u03d5\u2032\u2227\u2203V.\u03d5). According to lemma 3 above, \u2203V.\u03d5 \u2227 \u2203V.\u03d5\u2032 is consistent if and only if \u2203V.\u03d5 \u2227 \u03d5\u2032 (or \u2203V.\u03d5\u2032 \u2227 \u03d5) is consistent. So (IC4) holds.\n3. Now we prove (IC7) and (IC8). FS, FS\u2032 are collections of forgetting set for \u25b3\u00b51(\u03a6) and \u25b3\u00b51\u2227\u00b52(\u03a6) respectively in the definition. Let \u25b3f1\u00b51(\u03a6) = \u2228V \u2208FS(\u2227 n i=1\u2203V.\u03d5i \u2227 \u00b51). If \u25b3f1\u00b51(\u03a6) \u2227 \u00b52 is consistent, then \u2203V0 satisfying that \u2227ni=1\u2203V0.\u03d5i \u2227 \u00b51 \u2227 \u00b52 is consistent. The cardinals of sets in FS, FS\u2032 are the same. So V0 \u2208 FS\u2032. Conversely, \u2200V \u2032 \u2208 FS\u2032, V \u2032 \u2208 FS. Then we have \u25b3f1\u00b51(\u03a6) \u2227 \u00b52 \u2261 \u25b3 f1 \u00b51\u2227\u00b52(\u03a6).\n4. For some set V , the conjunction of every formula in \u03a61 \u2294 \u03a6n2 after forgetting V is consistent if and only if it is the same case for \u03a61 \u2294 \u03a62 after forgetting V . The collection of forgetting sets in \u25b3f1\u00b5 (\u03a61 \u2294 \u03a6 n 2 )is the same as the one for \u25b3f1\u00b5 (\u03a61 \u2294 \u03a62). The knowledge set \u03a61 \u2294 \u03a6 n 2 after forgetting V \u2208 FS is \u2228V \u2208FS(\u2227\u03d5\u2208\u03a61\u2203V.\u03d5 \u2227 n i=1 (\u2227\u03c8\u2208\u03a62\u2203V.\u03c8) \u2227 \u00b5) = \u2228V \u2208FS(\u2227\u03d5\u2208\u03a61\u2203V.\u03d5\u2227\u03c8\u2208\u03a62 \u2203V.\u03c8\u2227\u00b5). Thus after forgetting V , two knowledge sets \u03a61\u2294\u03a6n2 and \u03a61\u2294\u03a62 become identical, i.e., \u25b3f1\u00b5 (\u03a61 \u2294 \u03a6 n 2 ) \u2261 \u25b3 f1 \u00b5 (\u03a61 \u2294\u03a62).\nThe operator \u25b3f1\u00b5 doesn\u2019t satisfy postulates (IC5) and (IC6), but it satisfies the proposed properties (A1) and (A2). We think that \u25b3\u00b5(\u03a61) \u2227 \u25b3\u00b5(\u03a62) doesn\u2019t represent the common alternatives of the two groups which are indeed Th(\u25b3\u00b5(\u03a61)) \u2229 Th(\u25b3\u00b5(\u03a62)) ( Th(\u03d5) denotes the deduction closure of formula \u03d5). If we select the minimal sets w.r.t setinclusion then we get another operator.\nDefinition 2: Let \u03a6 = {\u03d51, \u03d52, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03d5n} and \u00b5 an integrity constraint. V \u2286 \u222ani=1V ar(\u03d5i), the minimal number of variables for forgetting FS = {V is minimal w.r.t set-inclusion | \u2227ni=1\u2203V.\u03d5 \u2227 \u00b5 is consistent}. We define an operator as follows: \u25b3f2\u00b5 (\u03a6) = \u2228V \u2208FS(\u2227 n i=1\u2203V.\u03d5 \u2227 \u00b5).\nFor the example of co-owners, The results of \u25b3f2\u00b5 and \u25b3 f1 \u00b5 are the same one. Analogously, \u25b3f2\u00b5 satisfies (A1), (A2) and some postulates.\nTheorem 5: \u25b3f2\u00b5 satisfies (A1), (A2), (IC0)-(IC4), (IC7) and (MI).\nThe next theorem states that the property (IC8) doesn\u2019t hold, thereby \u25b3f1\u00b5 and \u25b3 f2 \u00b5 are different. For example, Let \u03a6 =\n{\u03d51, \u03d52}, \u00b5 = \u22a4 and \u03d51 = \u00acp \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 \u00acr \u2227 \u00acs, \u03d52 = ((p \u2227 \u00acq \u2227 \u00acr) \u2228 (\u00acp \u2227 q \u2227 r)) \u2227 \u00acs. {a}, {b, c} are the forgetting sets for \u25b3f2\u00b5 , but {a} is the only one for \u25b3 f1 \u00b5 . So \u25b3 f1 \u00b5 (\u03a6) \u2261 \u00acq \u2227 \u00acr \u2227 \u00acs, \u25b3f2\u00b5 \u2261 \u00acp \u2227 \u00acs. These two operators belong to homogeneous context in [10]\nin which they propose three contexts for forgetting."}, {"heading": "V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "This paper proposes a scenario to eliminate conflicts occurring in the process of merging KBs by applying variable forgetting. Firstly, we discuss the relationship between belief merging and variable forgetting for KBs via the operation of dilation. As an interesting result, three classical model-based merging operators can be well captured by variable forgetting. Based on this relationship, we revise those merging operators by modifying variables in forgetting so that these new operators (after revising) become more smart in managing multiple KBs. Though our work is inspired from [10], our operator is based on variable selection on multiple KBs while [10] is based on the context of singe KB. Because propositional logic has limited power of expression, as a future work, we will consider our forgetting-based merging in a broad logic language such as description logic which is proved to be a highly successful class of knowledge representation languages in the Semantic Web."}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS", "text": "This work is supported by NSFC under grant number 60973003, 60496322 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China."}], "references": [{"title": "Arbitration (or how to merge knowledge bases)", "author": ["P.
