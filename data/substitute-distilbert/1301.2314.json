As the amount of data yielded by an analysis of even a moderately\u00ad sized network is already overwhelming, effective methods for extracting relevant information from these data are called for. One such method is to study the derivatives of the sensitivity func\u00ad tions yielded, to identify the parameters that upon variation are expected to have a large effect on a probability of interest. We further propose to build upon the concept of admissible deviation, which captures the extent to which a parameter can be varied without inducing a change in the most likely outcome.
