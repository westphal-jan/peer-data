We dwell on the problem of inferring the expected criticality of email and discuss work on the PRIORITIES system, centering on prioritizing email by criticality and modu lating the communication of notifications to users about the presence and nature of in coming email.\n1 Introduction\nMultitasking computer systems provide great value to users by hosting numerous processes and applica tions simultaneously. However, the ongoing execution of multiple applications often leads to environments fraught with a variety of notifications, including mes sages from the operating system about the status and health of computational processes, alerts from the pri mary application at focus, and from other applications being executed in the background.\nBeyond traditional sources of peripheral information, recent work on human-computer interaction highlights new forms of ongoing background services that can provide potentially useful context-sensitive informa tion and analysis (Breese, Heckerman, & Kadie, 1998; Czerwinski, Dumais, & Robertson et a!.; Leiberman, 1995; Horvitz, Breese, Heckerman eta!., 1998; Horvitz,\n1999). Indeed, novel sources of information, as well as more familiar alerts about incoming email messages, tips about application usage, and information about the computer system and network may be valuable. However, the rendering of auxiliary information under uncertainty comes at the cost of potentially distracting the user from a primary task at the focus of attention.\nWe are exploring utility-directed notification policies within the Attentional Systems project at Microsoft Research. We shall describe procedures that can pro vide policies to support an automated attention man ager that one day might be relied upon by computer users to mediate the transmission of notifications.\nWe take the perspective that human attention is the most valuable and scarcest commodity in human computer interaction. Rapid increases over the last two decades in computational power and network bandwidth, coupled with the explosion in the avail ability of online content, stand in stark contrast to the constancy of limitations in human information pro cessing.\nCharacterizations of the inability of people to handle more than a handful of concepts in the short-term are perhaps the most critical results of Twentieth-century psychology (Miller, 1956; Waugh, 1965). Beyond gen eral characterizations of cognitive limitations, psychol ogists have explored the influence of various forms of interruption on human memory and planning, start ing with the early work of Zeigarnik and Ovsiankina (Zeigarnik, 1927; Ovsiankina, 1928). The rich body of work in this realm includes studies centering on the use of interruptions as a tool to probe the machinery of memory and problem solving as well as to ascertain the influence of distractions on the efficiency with which tasks are accomplished (Gillie & Broadbent, 1989; Van Bergan, 1968; Posner & Konick, 1966).\nWe have been pursuing opportunities to harness in ference and decision-making procedures to guide the rendering of notifications about messages of uncer-\n306 Horvitz, Jacobs, and Hovel\nFigure 1: A Bayesian model for inferring the probabil ity distribution over a user's attentional focus.\ntain value. Our approach centers on developing the means for automatically assessing the expected util ity of messages and for continuing to make inferences about a user's focus of attention by monitoring multi ple sources of information.\nWe shall focus first on the use of Bayesian models to infer a probability distribution over a user's focus of attention and harnessing such inferences to infer the expected cost of transmitting alerts to users. Then, we consider methods for inferring the informational benefits of alerts and the costs of deferring notifica tion. After discussing principles of alerting based on a consideration of probability distributions over a user's attention and the time criticality of alerts, we shall present selected details of work on developing notifica tion and forwarding policies for incoming email.\n2 Inference about a User's Attention\nAlerts provide potentially valuable information at a cost of interruption. The cost of an interruption de pends on the nature of the interruption and on a user's current task and focus of attention. In the general case, a computer system is uncertain about the details of a user's attention. Thus, we seek to build or learn probabilistic models that can make inferences about a user's attention under uncertainty.\nWe have pursued the construction of Bayesian models that can infer a probability distribution over a user's focus of attention. In building probabilistic models for inferring the context-sensitive cost of distraction, we consider a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states of attentional focus and seek to identify the cost of communicating an alert given a probability distribu tion over the states of a user's attention. Such states of attention can be formulated as a set of prototypical situations or more abstract representations of a set of\nFigure 2: Extending the Bayesian network to consider key dependencies over time.\ndistinct classes of cognitive challenges being addressed by a user. Alternatively, we can formulate models that make inferences about a continuous measure of atten tional focus, or models that directly infer a probability distribution over the cost of interruption for different types of notifications. In our initial approach to mod eling a user's attention, we have Bayesian networks that can be used to infer the probability of alternate activity contexts based on a set of observations about a user's activity and location.\nFigure 1 displays a Bayesian network for inferring a user's focus of attention for a single time period. States of the critical variable, Focus OF ATTEN TION, refer to desktop and nondesktop contexts. Sam ple attentional contexts considered in the model in clude SITUATION AWARENESS-CATCHING UP, NON SPECIFIC BACKGROUND TASKS, F OCUSED CONTENT GENERATION OR REVIEW, LIGHT CONTENT GENERA TION OR REVIEW, BROWSING DOCUMENTS, MEETING IN OFFICE, MEETING OUT OF OFFICE, LISTENING TO PRESENTATION, PRIVATE TIME, FAMILY-PERSONAL FOCUS, CASUAL CONVERSATION, and TRAVEL.\nThe Bayesian network specifies that a user's current attention and location are influenced by the user's scheduled appointments, the time of day, and the prox imity of deadlines. The probability distribution over a user's attention is also influenced by summaries of the status of ambient acoustical signals monitored in a user's office; segments of the ambient acoustical signal over time provide clues about the presence of activity and conversation. The status and configuration of soft ware applications and the ongoing stream of user ac tivity generated by a user interacting with a computer also provide rich sources of evidence about a user's attention. As portrayed in the network, the software application currently at top-level focus in the operat ing system influences the nature of the user's focus and task, and the status of a user's attention and the appli cation at focus together influence the computer-centric activities. Such activity includes the stream of user ac tivity built from sequences of mouse and keyboard ac tions (see Horvitz, Breese, Heckerman et al., 1998 for a\n--;\ndiscussion of events and event languages for monitor ing user behavior) and higher-level patterns of applica tion usage over broader time horiwns. Such patterns include EMAIL-CENTRIC and WORD-PROCESSOR CEN TRIC, referring to prototypical classes of activity in volving the way multiple applications are interleaved.\nA more comprehensive Bayesian model for a user's at tentional focus considers key dependencies among vari ables at different periods\u00b7 of time. A dynamic network model including a set of Markov temporal dependen cies is portrayed in Figure 2. In real-time use, such Bayesian models consider information provided by an online calendar, and a stream of observations about room acoustics and user activity as reported by an event sensing system, and continues to provide inferen tial results about the probability distribution a user's attention.\n3 Expected Cost of Interruption\nLet us assume that the expected utility of relaying information contained in an alert to a user can be de composed into the expected costs and benefits of the alerting action. For such decomposable utility mod els, we can assume that the utility is the difference between the expected costs and benefits of the infor mation provided by the alert. We focus first on the expected cost of immediate alerting.\nAlerts and notifications can take the form of audio, visual, or a combination of audio and visual channels. Beyond the cognitive cost of the immediate distraction associated with an alert, visual alerts can obstruct im portant content being accessed or referred to as part of the task at hand. The cost associated with an au tonomous notification can depend on the details of the rendering of the alert. Thus, in the general case, dis tinct dimensions of cost associated with different no tification designs must be considered in models of in terruption.\nAs an example, it may be useful to decompose the cost of an alert into the cognitive cost associated with an interruption and the cost of obstruction of important display real estate. The latter dimension of cost can depend significantly on the design of the visual alert and the status of displayed information associated with the main task at hand.\nA design that overlays a graphical notification over content at the center of a user's attention and that requires a user to take action to remove the displayed alert is more costly than an alert that appears and dis appears autonomously in a timely and elegant manner. For simplification, we shall merge the cost of interrup tion and the cost of obstruction into a single cost. The\nAttention-Sensitive Alerting 307\ngenerality of the methods will not suffer from such a coalescence.\nConsider a set of alerting outcomes, A;, Fj, represent ing the situation where a notification A; occurs when a user is in a state of attentional focus, F;. We as sess for each alerting outcome, a cost function of the form C0 (A;, F;), referring to the cost of being alerted via action A; when the user is in attentional state Fj. Given uncertainty about a user's state of attention, the expected cost of alerting (ECA) a user with action A; is,\nECA = L C0(A;, F;)p (FjiE0) (1) j\nwhere Ea refers to evidence relevant to inferring a user's attention.\n4 Expected Cost of Deferring Alerts\nA strategy for reducing the cost associated with alerts is to suppress the alerts or to defer them until a period of time when the cost of relaying them is smaller. De cisions about deferral must take into consideration the cost associated with the delayed review of the infor mation. We now turn to the expected cost associated with deferring the review of a notification for some timet.\n4.1 Cost of Delayed Action\nWe define the criticality of a notification as the expected cost of delayed action associated with review ing the message. The expected cost of delayed action (ECDA) has been applied in such domains as emer gency medicine (Horvitz & Rutledge, 1991; Horvitz & Seiver, 1997) and time-critical aerospace applications (Horvitz & Barry, 1995). ECDA is the difference in the expected value of taking immediate ideal action (action at time t0), and delaying the ideal action until some future time t. Given a probability distribution, p(HIE), over states of the world H, associated with different time criticalities, and a time-dependent util ity function over outcomes, u(A;,H;,t), the expected cost of delayed action for notifications is,\nECDA=\nIIlJX L u(A;, Hj, t0)p (HjiE) j\n- maxA Lu(A;, H;, t)p(HjiE) (2) j\nECDA provides a conceptual framework for reasoning about the cost of the delayed review of notifications.\nLet us consider the example of decisions about noti fying users about the arrival of messages via email.\n308 Horvitz, Jacobs, and Hovel\nWe must consider the criticality of the email and the cost of interruption associated with the user's focus of attention. Notification about email includes desk top alerting when the user is working at or near a computer and notification via a mobile communica tion device, such as a cell phone or pager, when the user is away from a networked computer.\nThe utility of reading an email message can diminish significantly with delay in reviewing the message. In a salient example, delay in reviewing a message that in forms a user about a competitive bidding situation can lead to a costly loss of opportunity. Costs of delayed review of messages may be high in the context of com munications involving coordination. Important meet ings and deadlines can be missed with delayed review of messages. In less severe situations, costs can accrue with reductions in the amount of time available to pre pare effectively for a meeting. For such cases, the cost of delayed review of messages can be represented by loss functions that operate on the amount of time re maining until the meeting being communicated about occurs. After a meeting has passed, many options for action are eliminated. Thus, the rate of loss incurred with delays in the review of a message are typically smaller for periods of time following the occurrence of a meeting described in an email message.\nWe could attempt to group messages into classes in dexed by the types of action indicated at progressively later times and endeavor to formulate a set of out comes associated with ideal actions at different delays in reviewing the messages. With such a representation, Equation 2 could be used to compute an expected cost of delayed review directly. Alternatively, we can sim plify ECDA by considering the probability that a mes sage is a member of one of several criticality classes, given features of the messages. We associate with each criticality class a time-dependent cost function, de scribing the rate at which losses accrue with delayed review of the message. We take to to be the moment that email arrives and compute the expected cost for delays in reviewing the message until time t. In the general case, the costs of delayed review for messages in each criticality class may be a nonlinear function of delayed review.\nThe complexity and scope of communications among people makes the certain identification of the critical ity of email messages difficult. It is more feasible to pursue inference about a probability distribution over the criticality of a message given evidence gleaned from attributes of the message, including information con tained in the header and body of email messages.\nWe shall return to explore in detail methods for learn ing the criticality of email messages in Section 5. For\nnow, let us assume that each message is a member of one of n criticality classes. We further assume that each class is associated with a criticality-class-specific constant rate of loss that describes the cost of delayed review. Using Cd to represent a time-dependent rate of loss with delay, we can reduce Equation 2 to an expected cost of delayed review (ECDR),\nwhere t0 represents the time a message arrives, tis the time the message is reviewed, and Ed is evidence used to infer a probability distribution over the criticality class, H, of a new incoming message at hand. We refer to the constant rate of loss associated with delayed review as the expected criticality (EC) of a message,\n4.2 Ideal Alerting about New Messages\n(4)\nUsers typically review email periodically even when their computing systems are configured to suppress the active emission of alerts about incoming email. To de velop ideal alerting policies, we consider the cost of delayed review of information incurred in a world ab sent of notifications. The cost of delay in such settings depends on the criticality of the message and the time passing before a user reviews a message without exter nal prompting.\nThe expected delay in the review of messages in an alert-free setting can be inferred from information about the frequency that users will attend to unread messages without prompting. Beyond considering the frequency that users will review messages on their own, we can consider expected delays associated with a pol icy of relaying notifications to users when the cost of interruption is inferred to be negligible. With such a policy in force, the delay until new messages are reviewed can be inferred from information about the expected time before a user's attentional resources will become freed to review the messages.\nWe refer to the time between periods of reviewing new messages in the absence of explicit alerts as the inspec tion interoal, I. The inspection interval is influenced by multiple factors including the user's focus of at tention and location. A user's inspection interval is typically reduced when they are at a distance from networked computers.\nThe Bayesian networks presented in F igure 1 and 2 include a variable representing the inspection interval. As displayed by the dependency structure of the mod els, the variable INSPECTION INTERVAL, is influenced\nby USER'S ATTENTIONAL FOCUS and APPLICATION USAGE PATTERN.\nGiven a probability distribution over the inspection interval, the expected loss associated with reviewing messages in an alert-free setting, ECDR', is\nECDR' = LP(I;)(t\ufffd_, +I; -to) L Cd(H;)p(H;IEd) j i (5) where t\ufffd_, is the time of last access, t0 is the time a message has arrived, and I; is the inspection interval. The expected value of transmitting an alert (EVTA) about a message at some time t before a user reviews the email is the increase in the expected utility with being informed about the message at t versus at the time we expect the user to access the email in the absence of an alert. That is,\nEVTA=\nLP(I;)(fl_1 +I;-to) L Cd(H;)p(H;IEd) j i\n(6)\nA system should relay information about a message when the net value of the alert (NEVA) is positive. This is the case when the EVTA dominates the imme diate ECA for the type of alert under consideration,\nNEVA = EVTA- ECA\n4.3 Chunking Messages and the Value of Alerting\n(7)\nThe grouping together of information from multiple messages into a single compound alert can raise the value of the content revealed under the guise of a sin gle, but potentially more complex, distraction. Re viewing information about multiple messages in an alert can be more costly than an alert relaying infor mation about a single message. We represent such increases in distraction by allowing the cost of an alert to be a function of its informational complexity.\nLet us assume that the EVA of an email message is independent of the EVA of other email messages. We use EVTA(M;, t) to refer to the value of alerting a user about a single message M; at timet and ECA(n) the expected cost of associated with relaying the content of n messages. We can modify Equation 7 to consider multiple messages by summing together the expected value of relaying information about a set of n new mes sages,\n..\nNEVA= L EVTA(M;, t)-ECA(n) (8) i=l\nAttention-Sensitive Alerting 309\nWe note that assuming independence in the value of reading distinct messages may lead to an overestima tion of the value of the multiple-message alert because strings of messages received in sequence may refer to related content.\nGiven inferred probability distributions over a user's attentional focus and inspection interval, an assess ment of the costs of distracting a user with alerts, and the time criticality of incoming messages, we can employ NEVA to continue to reason about the costs versus the benefits of alerting users with summariz ing information about the content of newly arriving email messages. We now turn to the task of auto matically assigning measures of expected criticality to email messages.\n5 Assigning Criticality to Messages\nBuilding a real-world system for exploiting NEVA to control alerting hinges on an ability to automatically assign a measure of expected criticality to incoming messages. Given the challenge and importance of mak ing inferences about the criticality of alerts, we shall dwell on details of inferring the expected criticality of email messages. Such methods have application to other classes of notifications.\nWe have developed an automated criticality classifier for email by leveraging and extending learning and in ference methods developed for performing text classi fication. The methodology employs several phases of analysis including: (1) selection of features, (2) con struction of a classifier, ( 3) mapping classifier outputs to the likelihood that an email message is a member of each criticality class, and ( 4) the computation of an expected criticality from the probability distribution over criticality classes for email messages.\nText classification is an active area of research and de velopment (see Dumais, Platt, Heckerman et a!, 1998 for a review of recent efforts. Machine learning meth ods employed in text classification include decision trees (Lewis & Ringuette, 1994), regression (Yang & Chute, 1994), Bayesian models (Lewis & Ringuette, 1994; Sahami, 1996; Sahami, Dumais, Heckerman et a!., 1998), and Support Vector Machines (Joachims, 1998; Scholkopf, Burges, & Smola, 1998).\nOur group has been studying the characteristics and performance of several text classification methodolo gies for classifying email including procedures based on Bayesian network learning procedures (Sahami, Du mais, Heckerman et a!., 1998) and the Support Vector Machine learning methodology (Vapnik, 1995; Platt, 1999a). Our studies of standard test corpora (e.g., Reuters corpora of business articles) and a variety\n310 Horvitz, Jacobs, and Hovel\nof text classification tasks demonstrated that specific forms of SVM strategies dominated naive Bayes clas sification procedures developed to date for text classi fication (Dumais, Platt, Heckerman et a!, 1998).\nOur current implementation of criticality assignment for email is based on a linear Support Vector Machine training methodology developed by Platt called Se quential Minimal Optimization (Platt, 1999a). Sup port Vector Machines build classifiers by identifying a hyperplane that separates a set of positive and neg ative examples with a maximum margin (see Platt, 1999a for details). In the linear form of SVM that we employ to assign criticality classes to email, the margin is defined by the distance of the hyperplane to the nearest positive and negative cases for each class. Maximizing the margin can be expressed as an opti mization problem and search and optimization thus lay at the core of different SVM-based training methods.\nTraditionally, SVM training methods yield classifiers that output a score describing the strength of member ship in a category. Platt has extended SVM methods by developing a methodology that provides an esti mate of the probabilities that items are members of different classes (Platt, 1999b). The procedure ern ploys regularized maximum likelihood fitting to pro duce estimations of posterior probabilities. We har nessed this approach to learn classifiers that output the probability that an email message is a member of different criticality classes.\nIn practice, we create a set of criticality classes and as sess time-dependent cost functions for each class. We obtain a training set by manually partitioning a cor pus of sample messages into distinct criticality classes. Given a training corpus of messages labeled by criti cality, we first apply feature-selection procedures that attempt to find the most discriminatory features for the set of target classes, using several phases of analy sis including a mutual-information analysis (Koller & Saharni, 1996; Dumais, Platt, Heckerman et a!., 1998; Saharni, Dumais, Heckerrnan et a!., 1998). We refer readers to the text-classification literature for details on practical and theoretical issues in feature selection.\nFeature selection procedures for text classification can operate on single words or higher-level distinctions made available to the algorithms, such as phrases and parts of speech tagged with natural language pro cessing. Basic feature selection algorithms for text classification typically perform a search over single words. Beyond the reliance on single words, we can make available to feature selection procedures domain specific phrases and high-level patterns of features, including general expressions that operate on classes of words and other features in email messages. We\nfound that providing such special tokens to text classification procedures can enhance classification sig nificantly(Saharni, Dumais, Heckerrnan et a!., 1998 ).\nIn investigating the construction of classifiers for email criticality, we identified special phrases and other classes of observations that we suspected could be of value for discriminating among email messages assoc iated with different time criticalities. The handcrafted features are considered during feature selection. To kens and patterns of value in identifying the criticality of messages include such distinctions as:\n\u2022 Sender: Single person versus an email alias, peo ple at a user's organization, organizational rela tionship to user, names included on a user con structed list, people user has replied to\n\u2022 Recipients: Sent only to user, sent to a small num ber of people, sent to a mailing list\n\u2022 Time criticality: Inferred time of an implied meet ing, language indicating cost with delay, including such phrases as \"happening soon,\" \"right away,\" \"as soon as possible,\" \"need this soon,\" \"right away,\" \"deadline is\" \"by time, date,\" etc.\n\u2022 Past tense: Phrases used to refer to events that have occurred in the past such as, \"we met,\" \"meeting went,\" \"took care of,\" \"meeting yester day,\" etc.\n\u2022 Future tense: Phrases used to refer to events that will occur in the future including ''this week,\" \"Are you going to,\" when are you,\" etc.\n\u2022 Future dates: Days and times representing future dates.\n\u2022 Coordination: Language used to refer to coor dinative tasks such as \"get together,\" \"can we meet,\" \"coordinate with,\" etc.\n\u2022 Personal requests: Phrases associated with direct requests for assistance, including sentences ending with question marks, \"will you,\" \"are you,\" \"can you,\" \"I need,\" \"take care of,\" \"need to know,\" etc.\n\u2022 Importance: Language and symbols referring to importance including the presence of an explicit high or low priority flag, and such phrases as \"is important,\" \"is critical,\" etc.\n\u2022 Length of message: Size of new component of a message (excluding the forwarded thread)\n\u2022 Presence of attachments: Noting the inclusion of documents in the email\n\u2022 Time of day: The time a message was composed.\n\u2022 Signs of Junk email: patterns such as percent nonalphanumeric characters, and pornographic content, marketing phraseology such as \"Free!,\" \"Only$,\" \"Limited offer,\" etc.\nWe found that the coupling of an SVM classifier with criticality-specific tokens can effectively classify email into criticality classes and into overall estimates of expected criticality. In an evaluation, a criticality clas sifier was trained from approximately 1500 messages, divided into approximately equal sets of low and high priority email messages. A curve showing the ability of the classifier to classify messages from a test corpora consisting of 250 high and 250 low priority messages, selected by a user from a large inbox, is displayed in Figure 3. The Receiver-Operator (ROC) curve dis plays the probability of high priority email being clas sified as low priority email and the probability of low priority email being classified as high priority email for different values of the probability threshold used to define the high and low criticality message classes.\nAlthough it is useful to demonstrate the ability of the classifier to appropriately label cases of low and high criticality email, we are most interested in the use of the inferred probabilities of membership in alternate classes to compute the expected criticality of messages, and in the ultimate use of such information in comput ing the NEVA associated with messages.\nAs part of the validation of the automated assign ment of measures of criticality for email, we gener ated expected criticalities of email messages, assum ing a linear cost of delay with time for each criticality class, and summing the costs for each class weighted\nAttention-Sensitive Alerting 311\nby the probability that messages are members of each class as reported by the classifier. Our validations have shown that the classifier performs well even with the use of only two classes of criticality: time-critical mes sages and normal/low priority messages. In a valida tion study, one of the authors scored the criticality of messages by hand on a 1 to 100 scale, using 1 to indi cate the messages of lowest criticality and 100 to rep resent the most time-critical messages. To probe the effectiveness of the expected criticality measure, we computed correlation coefficients and generated scat ter plots to visualize relationships between the assessed criticalities and the computed expected criticality. In a sample study, one of the authors assess.ed the criti cality of 200 email messages received over three days. A correlation coefficient of 0.9 was found between the user tagged criticality and the automated assignment of expected criticality.\n6 PRIORITIES Prototypes\nWe have been exploring the use of attention manage ment for email messages through implementations of several prototypes we refer to as the PRIORITIES fam ily of systems. The PRIORITIES prototypes learn clas sifiers from examples drawn from a user's email and apply the classifiers in real time to assign expected criticalities to incoming email messages. The systems work with the MS Outlook 2000 messaging and cal endar system. During feature selection, the systems consider categories of features described in Section 5.\nThe classification learning and inference procedures have been integrated in a software application that calls the Microsoft Exchange MAPI and Outlook 2000 CDO interfaces. These services grant the system ac cess to details of the message header, including sender and recipient information, and the organizational hier archy at Microsoft. When email arrives, the real-time classifier examines the incoming messages for words and phrases and makes calls to acquire sender, recipi ent, and organizational information.\nAn early version of PRIORITIES has been distributed widely at Microsoft for real-world testing. This ver sion assigns a measure of expected criticality to all in coming mail, using a pretrained, default classifier or a classifier that is custom-trained by the onboard learn ing subsystem. The system has been integrated with the MS Research EVE event sensing system, developed as part of the LUMIERE intelligent interface project (Horvitz, Breese, & Heckerman eta!., 1998), enabling the system to continue to consider a variety of obser vations, including keyboard and mouse activity, and room acoustics. Information about a user's schedule is accessed directly from Outlook's online calendar.\n312 Horvitz, Jacobs, and Hovel\nThe version of the PRIORITIES system that is currently being tested by users at Microsoft provides an email viewer client that displays email sorted by criticality and scoped by a user-specified period of time. A dis play of the Priorities client is displayed in Figure 4. The prototype can be instructed to take a variety of actions based on observations about the user's activ ity and location, and the inferred expected criticality of incoming mail. Actions include playing criticality specific sounds that were specially composed for the system, bringing the client to the foreground, and opening email messages and sizing and centering the email according to criticality. The system can be di rected to perform a variety of automated forwarding and response services based on expected criticality. Moving beyond the desktop, the system has the abil ity to forward messages to a user's cell phone or pager based on criticality and the time a user is away from the office. For mobile settings associated with limited time and bandwidth, PRIORITIES can be employed to download messages in order of expected criticality.\nA more advanced version of PRIORITIES, named PRIORITIES-ATTEND serves as our testbed for per forming more sophisticated inference about a user's attention and for making decisions about notification based on NEVA. This version has been integrated with a manually constructed Bayesian network that performs inference about a user's attention. Work is underway on the development of effective assess ment techniques and richer models for representing and reasoning about a user's attention and the costs of interruption. Our experiences to date with the use of automated alerting machinery suggest that a decision-theoretic approach to alerting can fundamen tally change the way users work with email communi cations.\n7 Summary\nWe have described efforts to harness decision-theoretic principles to control alerting in computing and com munication systems. We presented attention-sensitive procedures for computing the net expected value of alerts. We framed the discussion with the task of relay\ning notifications about incoming email messages. Af ter presenting principles for decisions about alerting users about messages, we presented work on automat ically assessing the expected criticality of email mes sages. Finally, we presented work on the PRIORITIES systems, prototypes that operate with the Microsoft Outlook email and scheduling application.\nThere are numerous opportunities for enhancing the value of computing systems through harnessing meth ods that perform ongoing inference about a user's at-\ntention and about the criticality of different sources of information. We are continuing our pursuit of decision-theoretic machinery that can endow operating systems with the ability to monitor multiple sources of information and make intelligent decisions about the expected value of transmitting notifications to users.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank John Platt for his assistance.\nReferences\nBergan, A.
