In this work, we consider the problem of creating fair course timetables in the context of a particular variant of the\n\u2217Research funded in parts by the School of Engineering of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. A preliminary version appeared in: Proc. 9th Int. Conf. on the Practice and Theory of Automated Timetabling (PATAT), 2012, pp. 114\u2013130.\nUCTP, the curriculum-based course timetabling (CB-CTT) problem proposed in [DGMS07]. The CB-CTT formulation features various hard and soft constraints which model typical real-world requirements. The hard constraints are basic requirements, for example, no two lectures may be held in the same room at the same time. The feasible solutions to a CB-CTT instance are the timetables satisfying all hard constraints. Soft constraints characterize properties of a course schedule which are undesirable for the stakeholders. The quality of a feasible timetable is determined by the extent to which the soft constraints are violated. A soft constraint violation results in a penalty, and the task is to find a feasible timetable such that the total penalty is minimal. Situations may arise however, in which a large part of penalty hits only a small group of the stakeholders, who would thus receive a poor timetable in comparison to others. In other words, a timetable may be unfair due to an unequal distribution of penalty. In this work, we apply fairness criteria to the CB-CTT problem. Our goal is to achieve a balance of interests between the stakeholders by imposing fairness conditions on the distribution of penalty and thus, to improve the overall stakeholder satisfaction.\nIn general, fairness is of interest whenever scarce resources are allocated to stakeholders with demands. In economics for example, the distribution of wealth and income and how to measure inequality of resource distributions is of major concern, see for example [FS06] and [SF97]. In computer science, fairness is a central theme in design and analysis of communication protocols (see for instance [BFCYZ02, BG92, BFT11, JCH84, KMT98, KRT01, OW04, SB08]). In operations research, fairness criteria have been applied for example to the aircraft landing problem by [SK08]. In the literature, there is a wealth of different definitions of how to determine the fairness of a given resource distribution. For instance, we may consider the total amount of allocated resources, the outcome for the worst-off stakeholder, the deviation from the mean allocation, and so forth. We propose two fair variants of the CB-CTT problem, which differ with respect to the underlying notion of fairness. Our first problem forumation, MMF-CB-CTT, is based on lexicographic max-min fairness, to which we will refer to as max-min fairness for brevity. This fairness notion often appears in the context of network bandwidth allocation (see for example [BG92, SB08]). Max-min fairness is a purely qualitative measure of fairness, i. e., given two allocations, max-min fairness tells us which of the two is better, but not by how much. Our second problem formulation, JFI-CB-CTT, is based on Jain\u2019s fairness index proposed by [JCH84]. This fairness measure is used in the famous AIMD algorithm by [CJ89] used in TCP Congestion Avoidance. In contrast to max-min fairness, it conveniently represents the inequality of a resource allocation as a number between zero and one.\nIn order to solve the MMF-CB-CTT problem we propose MAXMINFAIR SA, an optimization algorithm based on simulated annealing (SA). Due to the mild requirements of SA on the problem structure, the proposed algorithm can easily be tailored to other max-min fair optimisation problems. A delicate part of the algorithm is the energy difference function, which quantifies how much worse one solution is compared to another solution \u2013 a piece of information we do not get directly from max-min fairness. We propose three different energy difference functions and evaluate their impact on the performance of MAXMINFAIR SA on the 21 standard instances from track three of the ITC2007 competition ([DGS12]). Our experiments indicate, that the known best solutions with respect to the CB-CTT model are quite fair in the max-min sense, but further improvements are possible for 15 out of 21 instances and often a considerable improvement of the worst-off\nstakeholder is achieved. The fairness conditions imposed by max-min fairness are rather strict in the sense that there is no tradeoff between fairness and the total amount of penalty. In practice however, it may be desirable to pick a timetable from a number of solutions with varying tradeoffs between fairness and total penalty. Our proposed JFI-CB-CTT problem is a bi-criteria optimisation problem, which offers this option. We investigate the tradeoffs between fairness and total penalty for the six standard instances from [DGS12] whose known best solutions have the highest total penalty compared to the other instances. Our motivation for this choice of instances is simply that if the total penalty of a timetable is very small, then there is not much gain for anyone in distributing the penalty in a fair way. Our conclusion regarding this approach is that, although the known best solutions for the six instances are already quite fair, we can improve the fairness further at the cost of only a small increase in total penalty. For a theoretical treatment of the price of fairness on so-called convex utility sets with respect to proportional fairness and max-min fairness, see the recent work by [BFT11].\nThe remainder of this work is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will provide a brief review of the curriculum-based course timetabling (CB-CTT) problem model as well as max-min fairness and Jain\u2019s fairness index. In Section 3 we will propose MMF-CB-CTT and JFI-CB-CTT, two fair variants of the CB-CTT problem formulation, and in Section 4, we will introduce the SAbased optimisation algorithm MAXMINFAIR SA for solving max-min fair allocation problems. Section 5 is dedicated to our experimental evaluation of the fairness of the known best solutions to 21 standard instances from the website by [DGS12] with respect to max-min fairness and Jain\u2019s fairness index, and the performance of the MAXMINFAIR SA algorithm."}, {"heading": "2 Preliminaries", "text": "In this section, we provide a brief review of the curriculum-based course timetabling problem formulation as well as relevant definitions concerning max-min fairness and Jain\u2019s fairness index."}, {"heading": "2.1 Curriculum-based Course Timetabling Problems", "text": "Curriculum-based Course Timetabling (CB-CTT) is a particular variant of the UCTP. It has been proposed in the course of the second international timetabling competition in 2007 (see [MSP+10]), and has since then emerged as one of the de-facto standard problem formulations in the timetabling community. The central entities in the CB-CTT formulation are the curricula, which are sets of lectures that must not be taught simultaneously. Both problem formulations proposed in the next section are based on the CB-CTT model.\nCB-CTT problems are NP-hard and a lot of effort has been devoted to the development of exact and heuristic methods which provide high quality solutions within reasonable time. A wide range of techniques has been employed for solving CB-CTT instances including but not limited to approaches based on Max-SAT ([AAN10]), mathematical programming ([LL10, BMPR11]), local search ([DS06, LH10]), evolutionary computation ([ABM07]) as well as hybrid approaches ([BDS12, Mu\u0308l09]). There has been a lot of progress in terms of the achieved solution quality in the\nrecent years. Interestingly, there seems to be no approach which is superior to the other approaches on most ITC2007 instances (see the website [DGS12] for current results).\nA CB-CTT instance consists of a set of rooms, a set of courses, a set of curricula, a set of teachers and a set of days. Each day is divided into a fixed number of timeslots, a pair composed of a day and a timeslot is called a period. A period in conjunction with a room is called a resource. Each course consists of a number of lectures, i. e. a number events to be scheduled, is taught by some teacher and has a number of students attending it. Each curriculum is a set of courses. For each room, we are provided with the maximum number of students it can accommodate and for each course we are given a list of periods in which it cannot be taught. A solution to a CB-CTT instance is a timetable, i. e. an assignment of courses to resources. The quality of a timetable is determined according to four hard and four soft constraints (see [DGMS07]).\nThe hard constraints are the following:\nH1 All lectures need to be scheduled and no two lectures of the same course may be assigned to the same period.\nH2 No two lectures may be assigned to the same resource.\nH3 Two courses in the same curriculum or taught by the same teacher must be assigned to different periods.\nH4 A lecture can only be scheduled in a period that is not marked unavailable for the corresponding course.\nA timetable that satisfies all hard constraints is called feasible. The CB-CTT formulation features the following soft constraints:\nS1 RoomCapacity: Each lecture should be assigned to a room of sufficient size.\nS2 MinWorkingDays: The lectures of each course should be distributed over a certain minimum number of days.\nS3 IsolatedLectures: For each curriculum, all lectures associated to the curriculum should be scheduled in adjacent timeslots.\nS4 RoomStability: The lectures of each course should be assigned to the same room.\nEach violation of one of the soft constraints results in a \u201cpenalty\u201d for the timetable. The CTCTT objective function aggregates individual penalties by taking their weighted sum. Detailed descriptions of how hard and soft constraints are evaluated and how much penalty is applied for a particular soft constraint violation can be found in the report by [DGMS07]. Given a CB-CTT instance I, the task is to find a feasible timetable such the aggregated penalty is minimal."}, {"heading": "2.2 Fairness in Resource Allocation", "text": "Fairness issues typically arise when scarce resources are allocated to a number of stakeholders with demands. Fair resource allocation has received much attention in economic theory (see for example [FS06]), but also occurs in a wide range of applications in computer science including bandwidth allocation in networks ([BG92]) and task scheduling ([RDK05]). In many optimization problems related to resource allocation, the goal is to maximize the total amount of resources allocated to the stakeholders. Fairness in this context means that the distribution of resources over the stakeholders is important and that certain resource distributions are preferred over others.\nConsider a resource allocation problem with n stakeholders resources. Each resource allocation (admissible solution) induces an allocation vector X = (x1, . . . ,xn), where each item xi,1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, corresponds to the amount of resources allocated to stakeholder i. Typically, a preference for certain resource distributions is implicitly or explicitly contained in the objective function. For example, the task can be to find allocations maximizing the sum of the individual allocations, the mean allocation, the root mean square (RMS), the smallest allocation, and so forth (see [Ogr10, SK08]). When the fairness of an allocation is important we may be interested in improving the outcome for the worst-off stakeholders or generally try to allocate resources equally among the stakeholders. Max-min fairness is a notion of fairness that favours better outcomes for the worstoff stakeholders. It has received attention in the area of network engineering, in particular in the context of flow control [BFCYZ02, KRT01, SB08, ZLCJ12]. Various inequality measures have been proposed such as the Gini index proposed by [Gin21] and Jain\u2019s fairness index proposed by [JCH84]. Generally, a highly unequal distribution of resources is considered unfair. Our evaluation of fairness in academic course timetabling focuses on max-min fairness and Jain\u2019s fairness index.\nOur evaluation of fairness in academic course timetabling focuses on the two fairness criteria max-min fairness and Jain\u2019s fairness index.\nMax-min Fairness. Max-min fairness can be stated as iterated application of Rawls\u2019s Second Principle of Justice by [Raw99]:\n\u201cSocial and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are to be of greatest benefit to the least-advantaged members of society.\u201d (the Difference Principle)\nOnce the status of the least-advantaged members has been determined according to the difference principle, it can be applied again to everyone except the least-advantaged group in order to maximize the utility (in the economic sense) for the second least-advantaged members, and so on. The resulting utility assignment is called max-min fair. A max-min fair utility assignment implies that each stakeholder can maximize his/her utility as long as it is not at the expense of another stakeholder who is worse off. Thus, a max-min fair allocation enforces an efficient resource usage to some extent. A max-min fair resource allocation is Pareto-optimal.\nIn order to define max-min fairness more formally, we introduce some notation. Let X be an allocation vector. We generally assume that each entrie of X is a nonnegative real number. By ~X we denote the vector containing the entries of X arranged in nondecreasing order. Similarly, let ~X be a vector containing the entries of X in nonincreasing order. For allocation vectors X and Y we write X mm Y if X is at least as good as Y in the max-min sense. For maximization problems\nsuch as bandwidth allocation this is the case iff ~Y lex ~X , where lex is the usual lexicographic comparison. For minimization problems such as the fair course timetabling problems proposed in Section 3, X mm Y iff ~X lex ~Y . Let s be a solution to an instance I of an optimization problem and X be the allocation vector induced by s. Then s is called max-min fair, if for any other solution s\u2032 to I we have X mm Y , where Y is the allocation vector induced by s\u2032. Since the allocations are sorted, max-min fairness does not discriminate between stakeholders, but only between the amounts of resources assigned to them.\nA weaker version of max-min fairness results if Rawl\u2019s Second Principle of Justice is not applied iteratively, but just once. This means that we are concerned with chosing the best possible outcome for the worst-off stakeholder. In the literature, related optimization problems are referred to as bottleneck optimization problems ([EF70, PZ11]). Note, that in contrast to max-min fairness, an optimal solution to a bottleneck optimisation problem is not necessarily Pareto-optimal. In the context of practical academic timetabling, the use of bottleneck optimization is hard to justify: each stakeholder is guaranteed to be at least as well off as the worst-off stakeholder, but no further improvement is considered.\nJain\u2019s Fairness Index. Jain\u2019s fairness index is an inequality measure proposed by Jain in [JCH84]. It is the crucial fairness measure that is used in the famous AIMD algorithm by [CJ89] used in TCP Congestion Avoidance. The fairness index J(X) of an allocation vector X is defined as follows:\nJ(X) =\n(\n\u2211 1\u2264i\u2264n\nxi )2\nn \u00b7 \u2211 1\u2264i\u2264n\nx2i . (1)\nIt has several useful properties like population size independence, scale and metric independence, it is bounded between 0 and 1, and it has an intuitive interpretation. In particular J(X) = 1 means that X is a completely fair allocation, i. e., the allocation is fair for every stakeholder, and if J(X) = 1/n then all resources are occupied by a single stakeholder. Furthermore, if J(X) = x% then the allocation X is fair for x percent of the stakeholders."}, {"heading": "3 Fairness in Academic Course Timetabling", "text": "Course timetabling problems fit quite well in the framework of fair resource allocation problems described in the previous section: A timetable is an allocation of resources (rooms, timeslots) to lectures. In this section, we will define two fair versions of the CB-CTT problem formulation proposed by [MSP+10]. The first one, MMF-CB-CTT, is based on max-min fairness. Since maxmin fairness enforces fairness as well as efficiency (maximum utility) at least to some extent, it is not a suitable concept for exploring the tradeoff between fairness and efficiency. Thus, we propose a second fair variant of CB-CTT called JFI-CB-CTT that is based on Jain\u2019s fairness index.\nIn order to use the fairness measures mentioned in the previous section, we need determine an allocation vector from a timetable. The central entities in the CB-CTT problem formulation\nare the curricula. Therefore, in this work, we are interested in a fair distribution of penalty over the curricula. Depending on the application, a different set of stakeholders can be picked, but conceptually this does not change much. Let I be a CB-CTT instance with curricula c1,c2, . . . ,ck and let fc be the CB-CTT objective function proposed by [DGMS07], which evaluates (S1)-(S4) restricted to curriculum c. This means fc determines soft constraint violations only for the courses in curriculum c. For a timetable \u03c4 the corresponding allocation vector is given by the allocation function\nA(\u03c4) = ( fc1(\u03c4), fc2(\u03c4), . . . , fck(\u03c4)) . (2)\nDefinition 1 (MMF-CB-CTT). Given a CB-CTT instance I, the task is to find a feasible timetable \u03c4 such that A(\u03c4) is max-min fair.\nIf a feasible timetable has max-min fair allocation vector, then any curriculum c could receive less penalty only at the expense of other curricula which receive more penalty than c. This is due to the Pareto-optimality of a max-min fair allocation.\nIn order to explore the tradeoff between efficient and fair resource allocation in the context of the CB-CTT model, we propose another fair variant called JFI-CB-CTT that is based on Jain\u2019s fairness index proposed by [JCH84]. In order to get meaningful results from the fairness index however, we need a different allocation function. Consider an allocation X that allocates all penalty to a single curriculum while the remaining k\u2212 1 curricula receive no penalty. Then J(X) = 1/k, which means that only one curriculum is happy with the allocation (see [JCH84]). In our situation however, the opposite is the case: k\u22121 curricula are happy since they receive no penalty at all. The following allocation function shifts the penalty values such that the corresponding fairness index in the situation described above becomes (k\u2212 1)/k, which is in much better agreement with our intuition:\nA\u2032(\u03c4) = ( fmax \u2212 fc1(\u03c4), fmax \u2212 fc2(\u03c4), . . . , fmax \u2212 fck(\u03c4)) , (3)\nwith fmax = max\n1\u2264i\u2264k { fci(\u03c4)} .\nDefinition 2 (JFI-CB-CTT). Given a CB-CTT instance I, the task is to find the set of feasible solutions which are Pareto-optimal with respect to the two objectives of the objective function\nF(\u03c4) = ( f (\u03c4),1\u2212 J(A\u2032(\u03c4))) , (4)\nwhere f is the CB-CTT objective function from [DGMS07] and J is defined in Eq. (1).\nBy a similar procedure, other classes of timetabling problem such as post-enrollment course timetabling, exam timetabling and nurse rostering can be turned into fair optimization problems. For example, for post-enrollment course timetabling, the central entities of interest are the individual students. Therefore, the goal were to achieve a fair distribution of penalty over all students. Once an appropriate allocation function has been defined, we immediately get the corresponding fair optimization problems.\nOur proposed problem formulations are concerned with balancing the interests between stakeholders, who are in our case the students. In practice however, there are often several groups of\nstakeholders with possibly conflicting interest, for example students, lecturers and administration. possibilities for extending the problem formulations above to include multiple stakeholders. For example, a multi-objective optimization approach may be considered, where each objective captures the fairness with respect to a particular stakeholder. When using inequality measures like Jain\u2019s fairness index for different groups of stakeholders, the inequality values can be aggregated, for instance using a weighted-sum or ordered weighted averaging [Yag88] approach. Furthermore, max-min fairness or a suitable inequality measure can be applied to the different objectives to balance the interests of the different groups of stakeholders."}, {"heading": "4 Simulated Annealing for Max-Min Fair Course Timetabling", "text": "Simulated Annealing (SA) is a popular local search method proposed by [KGV83], which works surprisingly well on many problem domains. SA has been applied successfully to timetabling problems by [Kos04] and [TD96]. Some of the currently known best solutions to CB-CTT instances from the ITC2007 competition were discovered by simulated annealing-based methods according to the website by [DGS12]. Our SA for max-min fair optimization problems shown in Algorithm 1 below (algorithm MAXMINFAIR SA) is conceptually very similar to the original algorithm. The SA algorithm generates a new candidate solution according to some neighborhood exploration method, and replaces the current solution with a certain probability depending on i) the quality difference between the two solutions and ii) the current temperature. Since max-min fairness only tells us which of two given solutions is better, but not how much better, the main challenge in tailoring SA to max-min fair optimization problems is to find a suitable energy difference function, which quantifies the difference in quality between two candidate solutions. In the following, we propose three different energy difference measures for max-min fair optimization and provide details on the acceptance criterion, the cooling schedule, and the neighborhood exploration method chosen for the experimental evaluation of MAXMINFAIR SA in the next section.\nAlgorithm 1: MAXMINFAIR SA input : scur: feasible timetable, \u03d1max: initial temperature, \u03d1min: final temperature, timeout output: sbest: Best feasible timetable found so far\nsbest \u2190 scur \u03d1 \u2190 \u03d1max while timeout not hit do\nsnext \u2190 neighbor(scur) if Paccept \u2265 random() then scur \u2190 snext if A(scur) mm A(sbest) then sbest \u2190 scur \u03d1 \u2190 next temperature(\u03d1)\nend return sbest\nAcceptance Criterion. Similar to the original SA algorithm proposed by [KGV83], algorithm MAXMINFAIR SA accepts an improved or equally good solution snext with probability 1. If snext is worse than scur then the acceptance probability depends on the current temperature level \u03d1 and the energy difference \u2206E. The energy difference measures the difference in quality of the allocation induced by snext compared to the allocation induced by the current solution scur. The acceptance probability Paccept is defined as:\nPaccept =\n\n\n\n1 if snext mm scur\nexp ( \u2212 \u2206E(X ,Y)\n\u03d1 ) otherwise,\nwhere X = A(scur) and Y = A(snext). In order to fit max-min fairness into the SA algorithm, we propose three energy difference measures: \u2206Elex, \u2206Ecw, and \u2206Eps. \u2206Elex derives the energy difference from a lexicographic comparison, \u2206Ecw from the component-wise ratios of the sorted allocation vectors and \u2206Eps from the ratios of the partial sums of the sorted allocation vectors. Our experiments presented in the next section indicate that the choice of the energy difference measure has a clear impact on the performane of MAXMINFAIR SA and is thus a critical design choice.\nFor an allocation vector X , let ~X i denote the ith entry after sorting the entries of X in nonincreasing order. The energy difference \u2206Elex of two allocation vectors X and Y of length n is defined as follows:\n\u2206Elex(X ,Y) = 1\u2212 1 n \u00b7\n(\nmin 1\u2264i\u2264n\n{ i | ~Y i > ~X i } \u22121\n)\n. (5)\n\u2206Elex determines the energy difference between X and Y from the smallest index that determines X mm Y . Thus, sorted allocation vectors which differ at the most significant indices have a higher energy difference than those differing at later indices. In particular, \u2206Elex has evaluates to 1 if the minimum is 1, and it evaluates to 1/n if the minimum is n.\nThe energy difference measure \u2206Elex considers the earliest index at which two sorted allocation vectors differ but not how much the entries differ. We additionally propose the two energy difference measures \u2206Ecs and \u2206Eps which take this information into account. These energy difference measures are derived from the definitions of approximation ratios for max-min fair allocation problems given by [KRT01]. An approximation ratio is a measure for how much worse the quality of a solution is relative to a possibly unknown optimal solution. In our case, we are interested in how much worse one given allocation is relative to another given allocation. We need to introduce some modifications of the definitions by [KRT01] since we are dealing with a minimization problem.\nNote that due to (2), an allocation vector does not contain any positive entries. Let \u00b5X ,Y be the smallest value of the two allocation vectors X and Y offset by a parameter \u03b4 > 0, i. e.,\n\u00b5X ,Y = max{ ~X1, ~Y 1}+\u03b4 . (6)\nThe offset \u03b4 is introduced in order to avoid divisions by zero when taking ratios of penalty values. The component-wise energy difference \u2206Ecw of allocation vectors X and Y is defined as follows:\n\u2206Ecw(X ,Y) = max 1\u2264i\u2264n\n{\n\u00b5X ,Y \u2212 ~Y i \u00b5X ,Y \u2212 ~X i\n}\n\u22121 (7)\nSince all entries are subtracted from \u00b5X ,Y , the ratios of the most significant entries with respect to mm tend to dominate the value of \u2206Ecw. Consider for example the situation that Y is much less fair than X , say, max{~X1,~Y1} occurs more often in X than in Y . Then for a small offset \u03b4 the energy difference \u2206Ecw(X ,Y ) becomes large. On the other hand, if X is nearly as fair as Y then the ratios are all close to one and thus \u2206Ecw(X ,Y) is close to zero.\nThe third proposed energy difference measure \u2206Eps is based on the ratios of the partial sums \u03c3i(X) of the sorted allocation vectors.\n\u03c3i(X) = \u2211 1\u2264 j\u2264i ~X j .\nThe intention of using partial sums of the sorted allocations is to give the stakeholders receiving the most penalty more influence on the resulting energy difference compared to \u2206Ecw. The energy difference \u2206Eps is defined as:\n\u2206Eps(X ,Y ) = max 1\u2264i\u2264n\n{\ni \u00b7\u00b5X ,Y \u2212\u03c3i(~Y ) i \u00b7\u00b5X ,Y \u2212\u03c3i(~X)\n}\n\u22121 . (8)\nCooling Schedule. In algorithm MAXMINFAIR SA, the function next temperature updates the current temperature level \u03d1 according to the cooling schedule. We use a standard geometric cooling schedule\n\u03d1 = \u03b1t \u00b7\u03d1max ,\nwhere \u03b1 is the cooling rate and t is the elapsed time. Geometric cooling schedules decrease the temperature level exponentially over time. It is a popular class of cooling schedules which is widely used in practice and works well in many problem domains including timetabling problems [LA87, KAJ94, TD98]. Geometric cooling was chosen due to its simplicity, since the main focus of our evaluation in Section 5 is the performance impact of the different energy difference functions. We have made a slight adjustment to the specification of the geometric cooling schedule in order to make the behavior more consistent for different timeouts. Instead of specifying the cooling rate \u03b1 , we determine \u03b1 from \u03d1max, the desired minimum temperature \u03d1min and the timeout according to:\n\u03b1 = ( \u03d1min \u03d1max\n) 1\ntimeout\n. (9)\nThus, at the beginning (t = 0) the temperature level is \u03d1max and when the timeout is reached (t = timeout), the temperature level becomes \u03d1min. We chose to set a timeout rather than a maximum number of iterations since this setting is compliant with the ITC2007 competition conditions, which are a widely accepted standard for comparing results.\nNeighborhood. In our max-min fair SA implementation, the function neighbor picks at random a neighbor in the Kempe-neighborhood of scur. The Kempe-neighborhood is the set of all timetables which can be reached by performing a single Kempe-move such that the number of lectures per period do not exceed the number of available rooms. The Kempe-move is a well-known and widely\nused operation for swapping events in a timetable [BEM+10, LH10, MBHS02, TD98, TBM07]. A prominent feature of the Kempe-neighborhood is that it contains only moves that preserve the feasibility of a timetable. Since the algorithm MAXMINFAIR SA only uses moves from this neighborhood the output is guaranteed to be a feasible timetable. In the future, more advanced neighborhood exploration methods similar to the approaches in [DS06, LH10] could be used, which may well lead to an improved overall performance of MAXMINFAIR SA."}, {"heading": "5 Evaluation", "text": "In this section, we will first address the question how fair or unfair the known best timetables for the ITC2007 CB-CTT instances are with respect to Jain\u2019s fairness index and max-min fairness.

Please note that the known best timetables were not created with fairness in mind, but the objective was to create timetables with minimal total penalty. In Table 1, sbest refers to the known best solution for each instance. A and A\u2032 refer to the allocation functions given in (2) and (3), respectively. The data indicates that the timetables with a low total\npenalty are also rather fair. This can be explained by the fact that these timetables do not have a large amount of penalty to distribute over the curricula. Thus, most curricula receive little or no penalty and consequently, the distribution is fair for most curricula. We will show in Section 5.2 however, that for timetables with a comparatively large total penalty there is still some room for improvement concerning fairness.\nThe rightmost column of Table 1 contains the sorted allocation vectors of the best solutions. For a more convenient presentation, all entries of the sorted allocation vectors are multiplied by -1. The exponents denote how often a certain number occurs. For example, the sorted allocation vector (\u22125,\u22125,0,0,0) would be represented as 52,03. The sum of the values of an allocation vector is generally much larger than the total penalty shown in the second column. The reason for this is that the penalty assigned to a course is counted for each curriculum the course belongs to. With a few exceptions the general theme seems to be that the penalty is assigned to only a few curricula while a majority of curricula receives no penalty. In the next section we will show that the situation for the curricula which receive the most penalty can be improved with max-min fair optimization for 15 out of 21 instances."}, {"heading": "5.1 Max-Min Fair Optimization", "text": "In Section 4, we presented algorithm MAXMINFAIR SA for solving max-min fair minimization problems. A crucial part of this algorithm is the energy difference measure which determines how much worse a given solution is compared to another solution, i.e. the energy difference of the solutions. We evaluate the impact of the three energy difference measures (5), (7) and (8) on the performance of MAXMINFAIR SA.\nOur test setup was the following: For each energy difference function we independently performed 50 runs with MAXMINFAIR SA. The temperature levels were determined experimentally, we set \u03d1max = 5 and \u03d1min = 0.01; the cooling rate \u03b1 was set according to (9). In order to establish consistent experimental conditions for fair optimization, we used a timeout, which was determined according to the publicly available ITC2007 benchmark executable. On our machines (i7 CPUs running at 3.4GHz, 8GB RAM), the timeout was set to 192 seconds. The MAXMINFAIR SA algorithm was executed on a single core. We generated feasible initial timetables for MAXMINFAIR SA as a preprocess using sequential heuristics proposed by [BMM+07]. The soft constraint violations were not considered at this stage. Since the preprocess was performed only once per instance (not per run), it is not counted in the timeout. However, the time it took was negligible compared to the timeout (less than 1 second per instance).\nTable 2 shows the impact of the parameter \u03b4 on the performance of MAXMINFAIR SA with energy difference measure \u2206Ecw. For each pair of values we performed the one-sided Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test with a significance level of 0.01. The data indicates that for best performance, \u03b4 should be small, but not too small. For \u03b4 = 1, MAXMINFAIR SA beats the other shown configurations on instance comp02 but performs worse than the other configurations on instances comp10 and comp20. For \u03b4 = 10\u22126 the overall performance is better than for \u03b4 = 1, but worse than for the other configurations. With \u03b4 = 10\u22122 and \u03b4 = 10\u22123, MAXMINFAIR SA shows the best relative performance. Thus, for our further evaluation we set \u03b4 = 10\u22123.\nTable 3 shows the relative performance of Algorithm MAXMINFAIR SA for the proposed energy difference measures (5), (7) and (8). The table shows for any choice of two energy difference measures i and j, for which instances MAXMINFAIR SA with measure i performs significantly better than MAXMINFAIR SA using measure j. Again, we used the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test with a significance level of 1 percent. The data shows that \u2206Ecw is the best choice among the three alternatives, since it is a better choice than \u2206Elex on all instances except comp11 and a better choice than \u2206Eps on five out of 21 instances. However, although \u2206Ecw shows significantly better performance than the other energy difference measures, it did not necessarily produce the best timetables on all instances. For the instances comp03, comp15, comp05 and comp12 for example, the best solution found with \u2206E = \u2206Eps was better than with \u2206E = \u2206Ecw.\nThe data in Table 4 shows a comparison of the sorted allocation vectors of the known best solutions from the CB-CTT website by [DGS12] with the best solutions found by the 50 runs of MAXMINFAIR SA with \u2206E = \u2206Ecw. First of all, for instances comp01 and comp11, the allocation vectors of the best existing solutions and the best solution found by MAXMINFAIR SA are identical. This means that MAXMINFAIR SA finds reasonably good solutions despite the certainly more complex fitness landscape due to max-min fair optimization. We can also observe that the maximum penalty any curriculum receives is significantly less for most instances and the penalty is more evenly distributed across the curricula. This means that although max-min fair timetables may have a higher total penalty, they might be more attractive from the students\u2019 perspective, since in the first place each student notices an unfortunate arrangement of his/her timetable, which is tied to the curriculum. Furthermore, we can observe that if the total penalty of a known best solution is rather low, then it is also good with respect to max-min fairness. For several instances in this category, (comp01, comp04, comp07, comp10 and comp20), the solution found by MAXMINFAIR SA is not as good as the known best solution with respect to max-min fairness. We can conclude that if there is not much penalty to distribute between the stakeholders, it is not necessary to enforce a fair distribution of penalty."}, {"heading": "5.2 The Tradeoff Between Fairness and Efficiency", "text": "We proposed the JFI-CB-CTT problem formulation in Section 3, which allows us to investigate the tradeoff between fairness and efficiency which arises in course timetabling. We can observe in column 4 of Table 1 that for all of the best solutions from [DGS12] the fairness index (1) is greater than 0.8, i. e., the known best solutions are also fair for more than 80 percent of the curricula. In order to solve the corresponding JFI-CB-CTT instances, we use the multi-objective optimization algorithm AMOSA proposed by [BSMD08] that is based on simulated annealing like Algorithm MAXMINFAIR SA. Since we do not expect from a general multi-objective optimization algorithm to produce solutions as good as the best CB-CTT solvers, we will consider the following scenario to explore the tradeoffs between fairness and efficiency: starting from the known best solution we examine how much increase in total penalty we have to tolerate in order to increase the fairness further. We will take as examples the six instances with the highest total amount of penalty, comp03, comp05, comp09, comp12, comp15 and comp21.\nThe temperature levels for the AMOSA algorithm were set to \u03d1max = 20 and \u03d1min = 0.01; \u03b1 was set according to (9) with a timeout determined by the official ITC2007 benchmark. The plots in Figure 1 show the (Pareto-) non-dominated solutions found by AMOSA. The arrows point to the starting point, i.e. the best available solutions to the corresponding instances. For instances comp05 and comp21 solutions with a lower total cost than the the previously known best solutions were discovered by this approach. The plots show that the price for increasing the fairness is generally not very high \u2013 up to a certain level, which depends on the instance. In fact, for comp09 and comp21, the fairness index can be increased by 3.5 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, without increasing the total penalty at all.\nIn Figure 1, the straight lines that go through the initial solutions show a possible tradeoff between fairness and efficiency: the slopes were determined such that a 1 percent increase in fairness yields a 1 percent increase in penalty. For the instances shown in Figure 1, the solutions remain close to the tradeoff lines up to a fairness of 94 to 97 percent, while a further increase in fairness demands a significant increase in total cost. For the instances comp05, comp09 and comp15, there are several solutions below the tradeoff lines. Picking any of the solutions below these lines would result in an increased fairness without an equally large increase in the amount of penalty. This means picking a fairer solution might well be an attractive option in a real-world academic timetabling context. For comp05 for example, the fairness of the formerly best known solution with a total penalty of 291 can be increased by 5.4 percent at 302 total penalty, which is a 3.8 percent increase.\nIn summary, improving the fairness of an efficient timetable as a post-processing step seems like a viable approach for practical decision making. Using a very efficient solution as a starting point means that we can benefit from the existing very good approaches to creating timetables with minimal total cost and provide improved fairness depending on the actual, instance-dependent tradeoff."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we introduced two new problem formulations for academic course timetabling based on the CB-CTT problem model from track three of the ITC2007, MMF-CB-CTT and JFI-CBCTT. Both problem formulations are aimed at creating fair course timetables in the setting of a university but include different notions of fairness. Fairness in our setting means that the penalty assigned to a timetable is distributed in a fair way among the different curricula. The MMFCB-CTT formulation aims at creating max-min fair course timetables while JFI-CB-CTT is a biobjective problem formulation based on Jain\u2019s fairness index. The motivation for the JFI-CB-CTT formulation is to explore the tradeoff between a fair penalty distribution and a low total penalty.\nFurthermore, we proposed an optimization algorithm based on simulated annealing for solving MMF-CB-CTT problems. A critical part of the algorithm is concerned with measuring the energy difference between two timetables, i.e., how much worse a timetable is compared to another timetable with respect to max-min fairness. We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm for three different energy difference measures on the 21 CB-CTT benchmark instances. Our results show clearly that the algorithm performs best with \u2206Ecw as energy difference measure.\nAdditionally, we investigated the fairness of the known best solutions of the 21 CB-CTT instances with respect to max-min fairness and Jain\u2019s fairness index. These solutions were not created with fairness in mind, but our results show that all of the solutions have a fairness index greater than 0.8. This means they can be considered quite fair. Nevertheless, our results show that some improvements are possible with respect to both max-min fairness and Jain\u2019s fairness index. The timetables produced by our proposed MAXMINFAIR SA algorithms are better than the known best ones with respect to max-min fairness for 15 out of 21 instances. Our investigation of the tradeoff between fairness and the total amount of penalty using the JFI-CB-CTT problem formulation shows that the fairness of the known best timetables can be increased further with only a small increase of the total penalty."}], "references": [{"title": "Curriculum-based course timetabling with SAT and MaxSAT", "author": ["Roberto As\u0131\u0301n Acha", "Robert Nieuwenhuis"], "venue": "In Proc. 8th Int.
