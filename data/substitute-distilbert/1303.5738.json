This can be used as a basis for a new way to implement Bayesian Networks that allows for approximations to the value of the posterior probabilities, and also points to a way that Bayesian networks can be extended beyond a propositional language.\n1 Introduction\nIn this paper we pursue the idea of having a log ical language that allows for a pool of possible hy potheses [Poole et a/., 1987; Poole, 1988], with prob abilities associated with the hypotheses [Neufeld and Poole, 1987]. We choose a very simple logical lan guage with a number of assumptions on the structure of the knowledge base and independence amongst hy potheses. This is intended to reflect a compromise between simplicity to implement and representational adequacy. To show that these assumptions are not un reasonable, and to demonstrate representational ade quacy, we show how arbitrary Bayesian networks can be represented by the formalism. The main contribu tions of this embedding are:\n\u2022 It shows a relationship between logical and prob abilistic notions of evidential reasoning. In par ticular it provides some evidence for the use of abduction and assumption-based reasoning as the logical analogue of the independence of Bayesian Networks. In earlier work [Poole, 1989; Poole, 1990] a form of assumption-based reasoning where we abduce to causes and then makes assumptions in order to predict what should follow is devel oped; it is a similar mechanism that is used here to characterise Bayesian networks.\n\u2022 It gives a different way to implement Bayesian networks1. The main advantage of this implemen tation is that it gives a way to approximate the probability with a known error bound.\n\u2022 Because the underlying language is not proposi tional, it gives us a way to extend Bayesian net works to a richer language. This corresponds to a form of dynamic construction of Bayesian net works [Horsch and Poole, 1990].\nIn [Poole, 1991], it is argued that the probabilistic Horn abduction framework provides a good compro mise between representational and heuristic adequacy for diagnostic tasks. It showed how the use of variables can be used to extend the purely propositional diag nostic frameworks, and how the use of probabilities can be naturally used to advantage in logical approaches to diagnosis.\n2 Probabilistic Horn Abduction\n2.1 Horn clause abduction\nThe formulation of abduction used is a simplified form of Theorist [Poole et a/. , 1987; Poole, 1988]. It is sim plified in being restricted to Horn clauses.\nAlthough the idea [Neufeld and Poole, 1987] is not restricted to Horn clauses (we could extend it to dis junction and classical negation [Poole et a/. , 1987] or to negation as failure [Eshghi and Kowalski, 1989]), in order to empirically test the framework, it is impor tant to find where the simplest representations fail. It may be the case that we need the extra represen tational power of more general logics; we can only demonstrate this by doing without the extra repre sentational power.\nWe use the normal Prolog definition of an atomic sym-\n1 For composite beliefs this is closely related to the algo rithm of Shimony and Charniak [1990], but also is devel oped for finding posterior probabilities of hypotheses (sec tion 3.2)\n272 Poole\nhoi [Lloyd, 1987]. A Horn clause is of the form:\na.\na <-aJ/1. .. . /I.an. false <-a1 /1. \u2022. \u2022 /1. an.\nwhere a and each a; are atomic symbols. false is a special atomic symbol that is not true in any interpretation2.\nAn abductive scheme is a pair (F, H) where\nF is a set of Horn clauses. Variables in F are implic itly universally quantified.\nH is a set of atoms, called the \"assumables\" or the \"possible hypotheses\". Associated with each as sumable is a prior probability.\nHere (and in our implementation) we write\nassumable(h, p). where h is a (possibly open) atom, and p is a number 0 \ufffd p \ufffd 1 to mean that for every ground instance h(} of h, hB E H and P(hB) = p. Definition 2.1 [Poole et a/., 1987; Poole, 1988] If g is a ground formula, an explanation of g from (F, H) is a subset D of H such that\n\u2022 FU D F g and\n\u2022 F U D \ufffd false.\nThe first condition says that, D is a sufficient cause for obs, and the second says that D is possible (i.e., F U D is consistent). A minimal explanation of g is an explanation of g such that no strict subset is an explanation of g.\n2.2 Probabilities\nAssociated with each possible hypothesis is a prior probability. The aim is to compute the posterior prob ability of the minimal explanations given the observa tions. Abduction gives us what we want to compute the probability of and probability theory gives a mea sure over the explanations [Neufeld and Poole, 1987].\nTo compute the posterior probability of an explanation D = { h1, ... , hn} of observation obs given observation obs, we use Bayes rule and the fact that P(obs!D) = 1\n2Notice that we are using Horn clauses differently from how Prolog uses Horn clauses. In Prolog, the database con sists of definite clauses, and the queries provide the neg ative clauses [Lloyd, 1987]. Here the database consists of definite and negative clauses, and we build a constructive proof of an observation.\nas the explanation logically implies the observation:\nP(Diobs) = P(obs!D) x P(D) P(obs) P(D) P(obs)\nThe value, P( obs) is the prior probability of the ob servation, and is a constant factor for all explanations. We compute the prior probability of the conjunction of the hypotheses using:\nP(hnlh! /1. \u2022. . /1. hn-d xP(h! /1. . . . /1. hn-J)\nThe value of P(h1 /1. ... /1. hn-d forms a recursive call, with P(true) = 1. The only other thing that we need to compute is\nIf hn is inconsistent with the other hypotheses, then the above conditional probability is zero. These are the cases that are removed by the inconsistency re quirement. If hn is implied by the other hypotheses, the probability should be one. This case never arises for minimal explanations.\nWhile any method can be used to compute this condi tional probability, we assume that the logical depen dencies impose the only statistical dependencies on the hypotheses.\nAssumption 2.2 Logically independent instances of hypotheses are probabi/istically independent.\nDefinition 2.3 A set D of hypotheses are logically independent (given F) if there is no S C D and h E D\\S such that\nF U S F h or F U S F ..,h\nThe assumptions in a minimal explanation are always logically independent.\nUnder assumption 2.2, if {hi, ... , hn} are part of a min imal explanation, then\nthus n\nP(h! /1. ... /1. hn) II P(h;) 1=1\nTo compute the prior of the minimal explanation we multiply the priors of the hypotheses. The posterior probability of the explanation is proportional to this.\nThe justification for the reasonableness (and univer sality) of this assumption is based on Reichenbach's principle of the common cause:\nRepresenting Bayesian Networks Within Probabilistic Horn Abduction 273\n\"If coincidences of two events A and B oc cur more frequently than their independent occurrence, ... then there exists a common cause for these events ... \" [Reichenbach, 1956, p. 163].\nWhen there is a dependency amongst hypotheses, we invent a new hypothesis to explain that dependence. Thus the assumption of independence, while it gives a restriction on the knowledge bases that are legal, really gives no restriction on the domains that can be represented.\n2.3 Relations between explanations\nThe remaining problem in the probabilistic analysis is in determining the value of P( obs). When using abduction we often assume that the diag noses are covering. This can be a valid assumption if we have anticipated all eventualities, and the observa tions are within the domain of the expected observa tions (usually if this assumption is violated there are no explanations). This is also supported by recent at tempts at a completion semantics for abduction [Poole, 1988; Console et a/., 1989; Konolige, 1991]. The results show how abduction can be considered as deduction on the \"closure\" of the knowledge base that includes statements that the given causes are the only causes. The closure implies the observation are logically equiv alent to the disjunct of its explanations. We make this assumption explicit here:\nAssumption 2.4 The diagnoses are covering.\nFor the probabilistic calculation we make an additional assumption:\nAssumption 2.5 The diagnoses are disjoint (mutu ally exclusive).\nIt turns out to be straight forward to ensure that these properties hold, for observations that we can anticipate3. We make sure that the rules for each possible subgoal are disjoint and covering. This can be done locally for each atom that may be part of an observation or used to explain an observation.\n''Vhen building the knowledge base, we use the local property that the rules for a subgoal are exclusive and covering to ensure that the explanations generated are exclusive and covering.\nUnder these assumptions, if { e 1, . . . , en} is the set of all explanations of g:\nP(g) P(e1 V e2 V ... V en) P(el) + P(e2) + ... + P(en)\n3Like other systems (e.g., [Pearl, 1988b)), we have to assume that unanticipated observations are irrelevant.\n3 Representing Bayesian networks\nIn this section we give the relationship between Bayesian networks and our probabilistic Horn abduc tion. We show how any probabilistic knowledge that can be represented in a Bayesian network, can be rep resented in our formalism.\nSuppose we have a Bayesian network with random variables a1, .. . , an, such that random variable a; can have values v;, 1, . . . , v;,n, . We represent random vari able a; having value Vi,j as the proposition a;( Vi,j ). The first thing we need to do is to state that the values of variables are mutually exclusive. For each i and for each j, k such that j =P k, we have the rule false <--a;( v;,j) 1\\ a;( vi,k) A Bayesian network [Pearl, 1988b] is a directed acyclic network where the nodes represent random variables, and the arcs represent a directly influencing relation. An arc from variable b to variable a represents the fact that variable b directly influences variable a; the rela tion influences is the transitive closure of the directly influences relation. Terminal nodes of a Bayesian net work are those variables that do not influence any other variables. The depth of a node is the length of the longest (directed) path leading into the node. A composite belief [Pearl, 1987] is an assignment of a value to every random variable.\nSuppose variable a is directly influenced by variables lla = b1, ... , bm (the \"parents\" of a) in a Bayesian net work. The independence assumption embedded in a Bayesian Network [Pearl, 1988b] is given by\nP(ailla 1\\ v) = P(allla) where v is a variable (or conjunction of variables) such that a does not influence v (or any conjunct in v). The network is represented by a rule that relates a variable with its parents:\na(V) <--b1 (VI) 1\\ ... 1\\ bm(V m) 1\\ c_a(V, V1, ... , Vm) The intended interpretation ofc..a(V, V1, ... , Vm) is that a has value V because b1 has value V1, ... , and bm has value Vm.\nAssociated with the Bayesian network is a contingency table which gives the marginal probabilities of the val ues of a depending on the values of b1, ... , bm. This will consist of probabilities of the form\nP(a = vibl =vJ, ... ,bm=vm)=p\nThis is translated into the assertion\nassumable(c_a(v, v1, v2, . .. , vm), p).\nNodes with no parents can be just made assumable, with the appropriate probabilities (rather than invent ing a new hypothesis and the above procedure would prescribe).\n274 Poole\nExample 3.1 Consider a representation of the influ ence diagram of figure 3.1, with the following condi tional probability distributions:\np(fire) 0.01 p( smokelfire) 0.9\np(smokel...,fire) 0.01 p(tampering) 0.02\np(alarmlfire 1\\ tampering) = 0.5 p(alarmlfire A -,tampering) = 0.99 p(alarml...,fire 1\\ tampering) 0.85\np(alm\u00b7ml...,fire A -,tampering) 0.0001 p(leavinglalarm) 0.88\np( leaving l...,a[arm) 0.001 p(report ileaving) 0.75\np(reportHeaving) 0.01\nThe following is a representation of this Bayesian net work in out formalism.\nassumable( fire(yes), 0.01 ). assumable( fire(no), 0.99 ).\nfalse <- fire(yes), fire(no).\nsrnoke(Srn) <- fire(Fi), c_srnoke(Srn,Fi).\nfalse <- srnoke(yes), srnoke(no).\nassumable( c_srnoke(yes,yes), 0.9 ).\nfalse <- leaving(yes), leaving(no).\nassumable( c_leaving(yes,yes), 0.88 ). assumable( c_leaving(no,yes), 0.12 ). assumable( c_leaving(yes,no), 0.001 ). assumable( c_leaving(no,no), 0.999 ).\nreport(Le) <- leaving(Al), c_report(Le,Al).\nfalse <- report(yes), report(no).\nassumable( c_report(yes,yes), 0.75 ). assumable( c_report(no,yes), 0.25 ). assumable( c_report(yes,no), 0.01 ) . assumable( c_report(no,no), 0.99 ).\n3.1 Composite Beliefs\nA composite belief [Pearl, 1987] is an assignment of a value to every random variable. The composite be lief with the highest probability has also been called a MAP assignment [Charniak and Shimony, 1990]. These composite beliefs have been most used for di agnosis [de Kleer and Williams, 1987; de Kleer and Williams, 1989; Peng and Reggia, 1990] (see [Poole and Provan, 1990] for a discussion on the appropriate ness of this) .\nLemma 3.2 The minimal explanations of the termi nal variables having particular values correspond to the composite beliefs in the Bayesian network with the ter minals having those values. The priors for the expla nations and the composite beliefs are identical.\nRepresenting Bayesian Networks Within Probabilistic Horn Abduction 275\nThe proof of this lemma and for lemma 3.4 appears in appendix A.\nAs the same procedure can be used to get from the pri ors of composite hypotheses and explanations to the posteriors given some observations, the following the orem is a direct corollary of lemma 3.2.\nTheorem 3.3 If the observed variables include all terminal variables, the composite beliefs with the ob served variables having particular values correspond exactly to the explanations of the observations, and with the same posterior probability.\nIf the observed variables do not include all terminal values, we need to decide what it is that we want the probability of [Poole and Provan, 1990]. If we want to commit to the value of all variables, we consider the set of possible observations that include assigning values to terminal nodes. That is, if o was our observation that did not not include observing a value for variables a, then we need to consider the observations o /\\ a(v), for each tuple v of values of variables a. To find the accurate probabilities we need to normalise over the sum of all of the explanations. \"'hether or not we want to do this is debatable.\n3.2 Posterior Probabilities of Propositions\nIn the previous section, the observations to be ex plained corresponded exactly to the conditioning vari ables. This corresponds to the use of \"abduction\" in [Poole, 1989]. In this section we show a relationship to the combination of abducing to causes and default rea soning to predictions from these causes [Poole, 1989; Poole, 1990].\nLet expl( a) be the set of minimal explanations of proposition (or conjunction) a. Define\nM(a) = L P(E) EEexpl(a)\nLemma 3.4 If H is a set of assignments to variables in a Bayesian Network, and H' is the analogous propo sitions to H in the corresponding probabilistic Horn abduction system, then\nP(H) = M(H')\nA simple corollary of the above lemma can be used to determine the posterior probability of a hypothesis based on some observations:\nTheorem 3.5 P( . _ \u00b7I b ) _ M(obs' A xi(v;)) x,- v, o s - M(obs') The denominator can be obtained by finding the ex planations of the observations. The numerators can be obtained by explaining Xi( vi) from these explanations.\n4 Best-first abduction\nWe are currently experimenting with a number of im plementations based on Logic programming technol ogy or on ATMS technology. These are implemented by a branch and bound search where we consider the partial explanation with the least cost (highest prob ability) at any time.\nThe implementations keep a priority queue of sets of hypotheses that could be extended into explanations (\"partial explanations\"). At any time the set of all the explanations is the set of already generated explana tions, plus those explanations that can be generated from the partial explanations in the priority queue.\nFormall , a partial explanation is a pair\n(g <- C, D) where g is an atom, C is a conjunction of atoms and D is a set of hypotheses.\nInitially the priority queue to explain a contains {(a<-a, {}), (false <- false, {})}\nWe thus try simultaneously try to find explanations of a and \"explanations\" of false (forming nogoods in ATMS terminology) that can be used to prune other partial explanations.\nAt each step we choose the element\n(g <- C, D) of the priority queue with maximum prior probability of D, but when partial explanations are equal we have a preference for explanations of false. We have an explanation when C is the empty conjunc tion. Otherwise, suppose C is conjunction a/\\ R. There are two operations that can be carried out. The first is a form of SLD resolution [Lloyd, 1987], where for each rule a <- b1 /\\ . . . /\\ bn in F, we generate the partial explanation\n(g <- b1 A ... A bn A R, D) . The second operation is used when a E H. In this case we produce the partial explanation\n(g <- R, {a} U D) This procedure, under reasonable assumptions, will find the explanations in order of liklihood.\n4Here we give only the bare-bones of the goal-directed procedure; there is an analogous bottom-up procedure that we are also experimenting with. The analysis is similar for that procedure. We also only give the propositional version here. The lifting to the 11eneral case by the use of substitutions is straightforward LLloyd, 1987].\n276 Poole\nIt turns out to be straight forward to give an upper bound on the probability mass in the priority queue.\nIf (g <- C, D) is in the priority queue, then it can possi bly be used to generate explanations D1, ... , Dn. Each D; will be of the form DUn;. We can place a bound on the probability mass of all of the D;, by\np(D1 V ... V Dn) p(D II (Df V ... V D\ufffd)) < p(D)\nThis means that we can put an bound on the range of probabilities of an goal based on finding just some of the explanations of the goal. Suppose we have goal g, and we have generated explanations 1J. Let\nPv = L P(D) DE'D\nD:(g-C,D)EQ\nwhere Q is the priority queue.\nWe then have\nP(D)\nAs the computation progresses, the probability mass in the queue PQ approaches zero and we get a better refinements on the value of P(g). This thus forms the basis of an \"anytime\" algorithm for Bayesian networks.\n5 Causation\nThere have been problems associated with logical for mulations of causation [Pearl, 1988a]. There has been claims that Bayes networks provide the right indepen dencies for causation [Pearl, 1988b]. This paper pro vides evidence that abducing to causes and making assumptions as to what to predict from those assump tions [Poole, 1989; Poole, 1990] is the right logical ana logue of the independence in Bayesian networks (based on theorem 3.5).\nOne of the problems in causal reasoning that Bayesian networks overcome [Pearl, 1988b] is in preventing rea soning such as \"if c1 is a cause for a and c2 is a cause for -.a, then from c1 we can infer c2\". This is the prob lem that occurs in the Yale shooting problem [Hanks and McDermott, 1987]. Our embedding says that this does not occur in Bayesian networks as c1 and c2 must already be stated to be disjoint. We must have al ready disambiguated what occurs when they are both true. If we represent the Yale shooting scenario so that the rules for \"alive\" are disjoint the problem does not anse.\n6 Comparison with Other Systems\nThe closest work to that reported here is by Char niak and Shimony [Charniak and Shimony, 1990;\nShimony and Charniak, 1990]. Theorem 3.3 is anal ogous to Theorem 1 of [Shimony and Charniak, 1990]. Instead of considering abduction, they consider models that consist of an assignment of values to each random variable. The label of [Shimony and Charniak, 1990] plays an analogous role to our hypotheses. They how ever, do not use their system for computing posterior probabilities. It is also not so obvious how to extend their formalism to more powerful logics.\nThis work is also closely related to recent embeddings of Dempster-Shafer in ATMS [Laskey and Lehner, 1989; Provan, 1989]. One difference between our em bedding of Bayes networks and Dempster Shafer is in the independence assumptions used. Dempster-Shafer assume that different rules are independent. We as sume they are exclusive. Another difference is that these embeddings do not do evidential reasoning (by doing abduction), determining probability of hypothe ses given evidence, but rather determine the \"belief\" of propositions from forward chaining.\nThe ATMS-based implementation is very similar to that of de Kleer and Williams [1987; 1989]. They are computing something different to us (the most likely composite hypotheses), and are thus able to do an A* search. It is not clear that including the \"irrelevant\" hypotheses gives the advantages that would seem to arise from using an A* search.\n7 Conclusion\nThis paper presented a simple but powerful mecha nism for combining logical and probabilistic reasoning and showed how it can be used to represent Bayesian Networks.\nGiven the simple specification of what we want to com pute, we are currently investigating different imple mentation techniques to determine which works best in practice. This includes using logic programming tech nology and also ATMS technology. We are also trying to the representational adequacy by building applica tions (particularly in diagnosis, but also in recogni tion), and based on this technology.\nIt may seem as though there is something terribly ad hoc about probabilistic Horn abduction ( c.f. the ex tensional systems of [Pearl, 1988b]). It seems, how ever, that all of the sensible (where Lj M ( ai( Vi,j)) = 1 for each random variable ai) representations (propo sitionally at least) correspond to Bayesian networks. The natural representation tends to emphasise propo sitional dependencies (e.g., where b is an important distinction when a is true, but not otherwise). These are normal Bayesian networks, but imply more struc ture on the contingency tables than are normally con sidered special.\nRepresenting Bayesian Networks Within Probabilistic Horn Abduction 277\nA Proof Outlines of Lemmata\nLemma 3.2 The minimal explanations of the termi nal variables having particular values correspond to the composite beliefs in the Bayesian network with the ter minals having those values. The priors for the expla nations and the composite beliefs are identical. Proof: First, there is a one to one correspondence between the composite beliefs and the minimal expla nations of the terminals. Suppose x1, . . . , Xn are the random variables such that variable x; is directly in fluenced by x;,, . . . , x; \u2022 . The minimal explanations of the terminal nodes co\ufffdsist of hypotheses of the form\nwith exactly one hypothesis for each x;, such that x;. (Vi;) is a logical consequence of the facts and the ex'planation. This corresponds to the composite belief XJ(vJ) 1\\ ... 1\\ xn(vn)\u00b7 By construction, the proofs for the terminal nodes must include all variables.\nSuppose E is a minimal explanation of the terminal variables. To show there is only one hypothesis for each random variable. Suppose that x; is a variable such that there are two hypotheses\nin E. If some x;,(v;,) or Xi;(vl) is not a consequence of FUE, then the corresponding c..x; hypothesis can be removed without affecting the explanation, which is a contradictio\ufffd to the minimality of E. So each \ufffdi;(v;;) and Xi;(v:,) IS a consequence of FUE. By consistency of E each Vi; = vi; . The only way these assumptions can be different is if v; \"# v:, and so we can derive x;(v;) and x;(v;) which leads to false, a contradiction to the consistency of E. Second, the explanations and the composite beliefs have the same prior. Given an assignment of value V; to each variable x;, define TI; by\nTI; = x;, ( v;,) 1\\ ... 1\\ x;., ( v; \u2022 . ) where x;,, . . . , x;., are the variables directly influencing Xi. By the definition of a Bayesian net, and the definition of c..x;, we have\nn\nII P(x;(v;)ITI;)\nn II C....Xi(Vi, Vil 1 ... , Vinj) i=l P(exp)\nWhere exp is the explanation. 0\nLemma 3.4 If H is a set of assignments to variables in a Bayesian Network, and H' is the analogous propo sitions to H in the corresponding Probabilistic Horn Abduction system, then\nP(H) = M(H')\nProof: This is proven by induction on a well founded ordering over sets of hypotheses. This ordering is based on the lexicographic ordering of pairs (h, n) where h is the depth of the element of the set with maximal depth, and n is the number of elements of this depth. Each time through the recursion either h is red need or h is kept the same and n is reduced. This is well founded as both h and n are non-negative integers and n is bounded by the number of random variables.\nFor the base case, where h = 1, we have all of the hy potheses are independent and there is only one trivial explanation. In this case we have\nP(H) = M(H') = II P(h) heH\nFor the inductive case, suppose a(v) is a proposition in H with greatest depth. Let R = H\\a(v). Under the ordering above lla U R < H, and so we can assume the lemma for n. U R. Note also that a does not influence anything in R (else something in R would have greater depth than a).\nP(H) P(a = v 1\\ R) = P(a =viR) x P(R)\n( \ufffd P(allla 1\\ R) x P(TiaiR)) x P(R) = LP(ailla) X P(TiaiR) X P(R)\nn.\nL P(ailla) x P(lla 1\\ R) n.\n= LP(c...a(v,lla)) x M(TI\ufffdU R') n.\nLP(c...a(v,n.)) x E P(E) n.
