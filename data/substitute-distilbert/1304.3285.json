These binary matrices have a finite number of exchangeable rows and an unbounded number of columns, where a 1 in row n and column k indicates that observation n expresses latent feature k. For example, given an image dataset of human faces, each observation is an image, and the latent features might be \u201cis smiling,\u201d \u201cis wearing glasses,\u201d etc. More generally, feature models can be viewed as a generalization of unsupervised clustering, see Broderick et al. (2012).\nProceedings of the 30 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, 2013. JMLR: W&CP volume 28. Copyright 2013 by the author(s).\nThe IBP prior is often used in sparse matrix factorization models where a data matrix of N D-dimensional observations is expressed as a product of two matrices that factor over K latent factors plus a noise term: X = ZA+E. Formally, this model has a binary feature matrix Z \u2208 {0, 1}N\u00d7K that linearly combines a latent factor matrix A \u2208 RK\u00d7D plus a noise matrix E \u2208 RN\u00d7D to form the observed data X \u2208 RN\u00d7D. Placing an IBP prior on Z lets K be unbounded and allows the number of active features K+ (those with non-zero Z column sums) to be learned from the data while remaining finite with probability one. The IBP inspired several infinite-limit versions of classic matrix factorization models, e.g. infinite independent component analysis models (Knowles & Ghahramani, 2007).\nInference with IBP models is challenging as its discrete state space has 2NK+ possible assignments. In turn, the IBP has found limited application to large data in comparison to the Chinese Restaurant Process, which assigns one feature to each observation. In this paper, we use Kurihara & Welling (2008)\u2019s MaximizationExpectation (ME) framework to perform approximate MAP inference with IBP matrix factorization models, termed MEIBP inference. For nonnegativeA, we show that we can obtain approximate MAP solutions for Z by maximizingN submodular cost functions. The submodularity property enables the use of a simple greedy algorithm that obtains at least a 13 -approximation to the optimal solution. While the worst-case complexity of MEIBP inference is comparable to sampling and variational approaches, in \u00a75 we show that MEIBP inference often converges to better solutions than variational methods and similar solutions as the best sampling techniques but in a fraction of the time.\nThis paper is structured as follows: in \u00a72 we present background material that sets the foundation for our presentation of MEIBP inference in \u00a73 and the resulting submodular maximization problem that arises, then in \u00a74 we discuss related work, and in \u00a75 we compare the MEIBP with other IBP inference techniques using both synthetic and real-world datasets.\nar X\niv :1\n30 4.\n32 85\nv4 [\nst at\n.M L\n] 2\n4 Ju\nl 2 01\n3"}, {"heading": "2.

In this infinite limit, however, P (Z) is zero for any particular Z. Griffiths & Ghahramani (2006) therefore take the limit of an equivalence classes of binary matrices, [Z], defined by the \u201cleft-order form\u201d (lof ) ordering of the columns and show that P ([Z]lof) has a non-zero probability as K goes to infinity.\nThe lof ordering arranges the columns of Z such that the binary values of the columns are non-increasing, where the first row is the most significant bit. Ding et al. (2010) examine different \u201cshifted\u201d equivalence classes formed by shifting all-zero columns to the right of non-zero columns while maintaining the non-zero column ordering.

Maximization-Expectation", "text": "Kurihara & Welling (2008) presented the ME algorithm: an inference algorithm that exchanges the expectation and maximization variables in the EM algorithm. Consider a general probabilistic model p(X,Z,A), where X are the observed random variables (RVs), Z are the local latent RVs, and A are the global latent RVs. RVs are qualified as \u201clocal\u201d if there is one RV for each observation, and RVs are \u201cglobal\u201d if their multiplicity is constant or inferred from the data.\nME can be viewed as a special case of a Mean-Field Variational Bayes (MFVB) approximation to a posterior that cannot be computed analytically, p(Z,A|X). MFVB operates by approximating the posterior distribution of a given probabilistic model by assuming independent variational distributions, p(Z,A|X) \u2248 q(Z)q(A) (Attias, 2000; Ghahramani & Beal, 2001). The independence constraint lets us compute the variational distribution q that minimizes the KL diver-\ngence between the variational distribution and true posterior. Without this constraint, the distribution that minimizes the KL-divergence is the true posterior, returning us to our original problem. In MFVB, we determine the variational distributions and their parameters using coordinate ascent optimization in which we iteratively update:\nq(Z) \u221d exp E q(A) [ln p(X,Z,A)] (2) q(A) \u221d exp E q(Z) [ln p(X,Z,A)] , (3)\nwhich commonly has closed-form solutions.\nThe EM algorithm can be viewed as a special case of MFVB that obtains MAP values of the global RVs by letting q(A) = \u03b4(A \u2212A\u2217), where \u03b4(\u00b7) is the delta function and A\u2217 is the MAP assignment. The ME algorithm instead maximizes the local RVs Z and computes the expectation over the global RVs A, which can be viewed as MFVB with q(Z) = \u03b4(Z \u2212 Z\u2217). In the limit of large N , the ME algorithm recovers a Bayesian information criterion regularization term (Kurihara & Welling, 2008). Also, maintaining a variational distribution over the global RVs retains the model selection ability of MFVB, while using point estimates of the local RVs allows the use of efficient data structures and optimization techniques. As we will show, the ME algorithm leads to a scalable submodular optimization problem for latent feature models."}, {"heading": "2.3.

The per-iteration complexity was O(N(K2 + KD)). This is comparable to the uncollapsed IBP sampler (UGibbs) that has per-iteration complexity O(NDK2) but does not marginalize over the latent factors, and as a result, takes longer to mix. In terms of both complexity and empirical performance, the accelerated Gibbs sampler is the most scalable sampling-based IBP inference technique currently available. One constraint of the accelerated IBP is that the latent factor distribution must be conjugate to the likelihood, which for instance, does not allow nonnegative priors on the latent factors.\nRai & Daume III (2011) introduced a beam-search heuristic for locating approximate MAP solutions to linear-Gaussian IBP models (BS-IBP). This heuristic sequentially adds a single data point to the model and determines the latent feature assignments by scoring all 2K+ latent feature combinations. The scoring heuristic uses an estimate of the joint probability, P (X,Z) to score assignments, which evaluates the collapsed likelihood P (X|Z) for all 2K+ possible assignments: an expensive N3(K+ +D) operation, yielding a per-iteration complexity of O(N3(K+ +D)2 K+)."}, {"heading": "5. Experiments", "text": "We evaluated the inference quality and efficiency of MEIBP inference on two synthetic and three realworld datasets. We used the runtime and predictive likelihood of held-out observations as our performance criteria and compared MEIBP inference with the methods listed in Table 1 (the finite and infinite VIBP are differentiated with an \u201cf-\u201d and \u201ci-\u201d prefix). We used a truncated Gaussian prior on the latent fac-\ntors for UGibbs and INMF, and Gaussian priors for the AIBP and variational methods. In our evaluations, we also included Schmidt et al. (2009)\u2019s iterated conditional modes algorithm, which computes a MAP estimate of a parametric nonnegative matrix factorization model: X = BA+E, where B and A have exponential priors and E is zero-mean Gaussian noise. We abbreviate this model \u201cBNMF\u201d; it has a per-iteration complexity of O(N(K2+ +K+D)).\nThe VIBP and MEIBP inference methods specify a maximum K value, while the sampling methods are unbounded. Therefore, we also included truncated versions of the sampling methods (indicated by a \u201ct-\u201d prefix) for a fairer comparison. We centered all input data to have a 0-mean for the models with 0- mean Gaussian priors and a 0-minimum for nonnegative models, and all inferred matrices were initialized randomly from their respective priors. Following Doshi-Velez & Ghahramani (2009), we fixed the hyperparameters \u03c3X and \u03c3A to 3 4\u03c3, where \u03c3 was the standard deviation across all dimensions of the data, and set \u03b1 = 3. We ran each algorithm until the multiplicative difference of the average training log-likelihood differed by less than 10\u22124 between blocks of five iterations with a maximum runtime of 36 hours. Our experiments used MATLAB implementations of the algorithms, as provided by the respective authors, on 3.20 GHz processors.\nSynthetic Data We created high-noise synthetic datasets in the following way: (1) sample zn,k \u223c Bernoulli(p = 0.4), (2) generate A with K random, potentially overlapping binary factors, (3) let X = ZA + E, where E \u223c N (0, 1). We evaluated the predictive likelihood on 20% of the dimensions from the last half of the data (see supplementary information).\nFigure 3 shows the evolution of the test log-likelihood over time for a small dataset with N = 500, D =\n500,K = 20 and a large dataset with N = 105, D = 103,K = 50. All models were initialized randomly with the true number of latent features, and the error regions display the standard deviation over five random restarts. The BS-IBP and INMF methods were removed from our experiments following the synthetic dataset tests as both methods took at least an order of magnitude longer than the other methods: in 36 hours, the BS-IBP did not complete a single iteration on the small dataset, and the INMF did not complete a single iteration on the large dataset.\nMEIBP converged quickest among the IBP models for both the small and large dataset, while the parametric BNMF model converged much faster than all IBP models. However, the IBP models captured the sparsity of the latent features and the MEIBP and UGibbs eventually outperformed the BNMF on the small dataset, while only the MEIBP outperformed the BNMF on the large dataset. The VIBP methods converged quicker than the sampling counterparts but had trouble escaping local optima. The uncollapsed samplers eventually performed as well as the MEIBP on the small dataset but did not mix to a well-performing distribution for the large dataset.\nReal Data Table 2 summarizes the real-world datasets used in our experiments. Piano and YaleBC are dense real-valued datasets, whereas the Flickr dataset is a sparse binary dataset (0.81% filled). For the Piano and Flickr datasets, we evaluated the predictive likelihood on a held-out portion of 20% of the dimensions from the last half of the datasets. The Yale-BC dataset had roughly sixty-four facial images of thirty-eight subjects, and we removed the bottom half of five images from each subject for testing.\nFigure 4 shows the test log-likelihood and convergence time for all inference methods applied to the real-world datasets, averaged over five random restarts. All inference methods were initialized with K = {10, 25, 50}\nas indicated by the size of the marker (the smallest marker shows the K = 10 results). The sampling methods (AIBP, UGibbs) also include a large faded marker that shows the results for unbounded K.\nThe Piano results were similar to the small synthetic dataset. The BNMF converged much faster than the IBP models, and the MEIBP performed best among the IBP models in terms of runtime and test loglikelihood\u2014it converged to a similar solution as the AIBP in one-third the time. Though UGibbs has the best per-iteration complexity, it got stuck in poor local optima when randomly initialized. The VIBP methods and MEIBP expressed large uncertainty about the latent factors early on and overcame these poor local optima. By using hard latent feature assignments, the MEIBP took larger steps in the inference space than the VIBP methods, which was beneficial for this dataset, and achieved similar results to the AIBP.\nMEIBP inference performed comparable to the best IBP sampling technique for the sparse binary Flickr dataset and converged over an order of magnitude faster. Surprisingly, the dense BNMF inference performed very well on this dataset even though the dataset was sparse and binary. The BNMF converged slower than the MEIBP because it inferred a sparse matrix from a dense prior, which took over four times as many iterations to converge compared to the dense datasets. While the t-AIBP converged to a better solution than the MEIBP, it took over an order-\nof-magnitude longer to surpass the MEIBP\u2019s performance. As we demonstrate with the Flickr results, initializing the AIBP with the MEIBP outcome obtained a similar solution in a fraction of the time (indicated as \u201cmeibp+aibp\u201d on the figure).\nThe MEIBP converged faster than the other IBP methods for the Yale-BC dataset but to a lower test likelihood. The UGibbs and BNMF also experienced difficulty for this dataset, where BNMF converged to a test log-likelihood around \u22123.6 \u00d7 106 (not visible in the figure). These linear-Gaussian models with nonnegative priors performed worse than the models with Gaussian priors because the dataset contained many images with dark shadows covering part of the face. The nonnegative priors appeared to struggle with reconstructing these shadows, because unlike the Gaussian priors, they could not infer negative-valued \u201cshadow\u201d factors that obscured part of the image.\nIn the above experiments, the MEIBP consistently exhibited a sudden convergence whereby it obtained a local optima and the ls-algorithm did not change any Z assignments. This is a characteristic of using hard assignments with a greedy algorithm: at a certain point, changing any latent feature assignments decreased the objective function. This abrupt convergence, in combination with the speed of the ls-algorithm, helped the MEIBP consistently converge faster than other IBP methods. Furthermore, the submodular maximization algorithm converged to local optima that were comparable or better than the sampling or variational results, though at the cost of only obtaining a MAP solution. Like the variational methods, it maintained a distribution over A that prevented it from getting stuck in local optima early on, and like the sampling methods,\nthe MEIBP used hard Z assignments to take larger steps in the inference space and obtain better optima."}, {"heading": "6. Summary and Future Work", "text": "We presented a new inference technique for IBP models that used Kurihara & Welling (2008)\u2019s ME framework to perform approximate MAP inference via submodular maximization. Our key insight was to exploit the submodularity inherent in the evidence lower bound formulated in \u00a73, which arose from the quadratic pseudo-Boolean component of the linearGaussian model. MEIBP inference converged faster than competing IBP methods and obtained comparable solutions on various datasets.\nThere are many discrete Bayesian nonparametric priors, such as the Dirichlet process, and an interesting area for future research will be to generalize our results in order to phrase inference with these priors as submodular optimization problems. Furthermore, we used a simple local-search algorithm to obtain a 13 -approximation bound, but concurrently with this work, Buchbinder et al. (2012) proposed a simpler stochastic algorithm for unconstrained submodular maximization that obtains an expected 12 - approximation bound. Using this algorithm, MEIBP inference has an improved worst case complexity of O(NK2+D).

Shifted Equivalence Classes", "text": "Here we discuss the \u201cshifted\u201d equivalence class of binary matrices first proposed by Ding et al. (2010). For a given N \u00d7K binary matrix Z, the equivalence class for this binary matrix [Z] is obtained by shifting allzero columns to the right of the non-zero columns while maintaining the non-zero column orderings, see Figure 5. Placing independent Beta( \u03b1K , 1) priors on the Bernoulli entries of Z and integrating over these priors yields the following probability for Z, see Eq. 27 in Griffiths & Ghahramani (2005):\nP (Z) = K\u220f k=1 \u03b1 K\u0393(mk + \u03b1 K )\u0393(N \u2212mk + 1) \u0393(N + 1 + \u03b1K ) (28) where mk = \u2211N n=1 znk. Letting K \u2192 \u221e yields P (Z) = 0 for all Z. However, the probability of certain equivalence classes of binary matrices, P ([Z]), can remain non-zero as K \u2192 \u221e. Specifically, Griffiths & Ghahramani (2005) show P ([Z]) remains non-zero for the \u201cleft-ordered form\u201d equivalence class of binary matrices, whereby the columns of Z are ordered such that the binary values of the columns are non-increasing, where the first row is the most significant bit. Here\nwe outline a similar result for the shifted equivalence class.1\nWe obtain the probability of the shifted equivalence class by multiplying the multiplicity of the equivalence class by the probability of a matrix within the class. For a given matrix with K columns and K+ non-zero columns, each shifted equivalence class has ( K K+ ) matrices that map to it, yielding:\nP ([Z]) =\n( K\nK+ ) K\u220f k=1 \u03b1 K\u0393(mk + \u03b1 K )\u0393(N \u2212mk + 1) \u0393(N + 1 + \u03b1K ) .\n(29)\nFollowing a similar algebraic rearrangement as Griffiths & Ghahramani (2005) Eqs. 30-33, except replacing the K!\u220f2N\u22121\nh=0 Kh! term with\n( K K+ ) \u2014which occurs be-\ncause of the different equivalence class multiplicities\u2014 results in:\nP ([Z]) = \u03b1K+ K+! \u00b7 K!

(30)\nWe then take the limit K \u2192 \u221e for each of the four terms. The first term has no K dependence and does not change in the infinite limit. For the second term we let K0 = K \u2212K+ and have K!K0!KK+ . Equations 60-62 in Griffiths & Ghahramani (2005) show that this term becomes 1 as K \u2192 \u221e. The infinite limit of the third and fourth terms are determined in the Appendix of Griffiths & Ghahramani (2005).

(31)\nwhere HN is the N th harmonic number.\nThe probability of the shifted equivalence class is nearly identical to the probability of the left-orderedform equivalence class:\nP ([Z]lof) = \u03b1K+\u220f2N\u22121 h=1 Kh e\u2212\u03b1HN K+\u220f k=1 (N \u2212mk)!(mk \u2212 1)!

Furthermore, they did not discuss the collapsed case where we first marginalize over the beta priors on Z.\nto be the most significant bit. The only difference between Eq. 31 and Eq. 32 is the denominator of the first fraction. For the left-ordered-form, this term penalizes Z matrices with identical columns. In the feature assignment view, this term penalizes features that are assigned to the exact same set of observations. The K+! term in the shifted equivalence class prior does not distinguish between identical and distinct columns of Z, and in turn, does not penalize repeated feature assignments. These two equivalence class probabilities are proportional in the limit of large N as the probability of two columns being identical approaches 0."}, {"heading": "S.3.

Learning K+", "text": "An ostensible advantage of using Bayesian nonparametric priors is that a user does not need to specify the multiplicity of the prior parameters. Clever sampling techniques such as slice sampling and retrospective sampling allow samples to be drawn from these nonparametric priors, c.f. Teh et al. (2007) and Papaspiliopoulos & Roberts (2008). However variational methods are not directly amenable to Bayesian nonparametric priors as the variational optimization cannot be performed over an unbounded prior space. Instead, variational methods must specify a maximum model complexity (parameter multiplicity). Several heuristics have been proposed to address this limitation: Wang & Blei (2012) sampled from the variational distribution for the local parameters\u2014which included sampling from the unbounded prior\u2014 and used the empirical distributions of the local samples to update the global parameters, while Ding et al. (2010) simply started with K+ = 1 and greedily added features. We did not address these techniques in this work as the MEIBP performed competitively with the unbounded sampling techniques without employing these types of heuristics. Furthermore, here we demonstrate that the MEIBP can robustly infer the true number of latent features when the K+ bound is greater than the true number of latent features.\nFor this experiment we generated the binary images dataset used in Griffiths & Ghahramani (2005), where the dataset, X, consisted of 2000 6 \u00d7 6 images. Each row of X was a 36 dimensional vector of pixel intensity values that was generated by using Z to linearly combine a subset of the four binary factors shown in Figure 6. Gaussian white noise, N (0, \u03c3X), was then added to each image, yielding X = ZA + E. The feature vectors, Zn\u00b7 were sampled from a distribution in which each factor was present with probability 0.5. Figure 7 shows four of these images with different \u03c3X values.\nWe initialized the MEIBP with K = 20, \u03c3X=1.0, \u03c3A = 1.0, \u03b1 = 2, \u00b5\u0303kd \u223c |N (0, 0.05)| (variational factor means), \u03c3\u0303kd \u223c |N (0, 0.1)| (variational factor standard deviations), znk \u223c Bernoulli( 13 ). With this initialization, we tested the MEIBP robustness by performing MEIBP inference on X for \u03c3X = 0.1, . . . , 1.0 in 100 evenly spaced increments with all hyperparameters and algorithm options unchanged during the experiment. MEIBP convergence was determined in the same way as the main experimental section. Figure 8 (top) shows a histogram of the final number of MEIBP features (Ktrue = 4) and Figure 8 (bottom) shows the final number of MEIBP features as a function of \u03c3X .\nThese results indicate that the regularizing nature of the IBP prior tends to lead to the correct number of latent features even when the K+ bound is much larger than the true K+. Furthermore this experiment indicates that MEIBP inference is robust to model noise, at least, for the simple data used in this experiment. At a medium level of data noise, the inference occasionally finished with K+ = 3, which resulted from two true latent factors collapsing to the same inferred latent feature. Once this occurred, MEIBP did not have a mechanism for splitting the features. For \u03c3X comparable to the latent factors, \u03c3X \u2265 0.9, MEIBP often inferred \u201cnoise features,\u201d which were essentially whitenoise and were typically active for less than 4% of the data instances.
