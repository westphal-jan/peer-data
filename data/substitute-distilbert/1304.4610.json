A partial list includes medical imaging (Lustig et al., 2007), radar systems (Potter et al., 2010), seismic imaging (Borcea et al., 2002), microscopy (Schermelleh et al., 2010), etc. The data acquisition devices, however, are often limited by physical and hardware constraints, precluding sampling with the desired resolution. It is thus of paramount interest to reduce the sensing complexity while retaining recovery resolution.\nFortunately, in many instances, it is possible to recover an object even when the number of samples is far below the ambient dimension, provided that the object has a parsimonious representation in the transform domain. In particular, recent advances in compressed sensing (CS) (Candes et al., 2006) popularize the nonparametric methods based on convex surrogates. Such tractable methods do not require prior information on the model order, and are often robust against noise.\nNevertheless, the success of CS relies on sparse representation or approximation of the object of interest in a finite discrete dictionary, while the true parameters in many application are actually specified in a continuous dictionary. For concreteness, consider an object x (t) that is a weighted sum of K-dimensional sinusoids at r distinct frequencies {fi \u2208 [0, 1]K : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r}. Conventional CS paradigms operate under the assumptions that these frequencies lie on a pre-determined grid on the unit disk. However, cautions need to be taken when imposing a discrete dictionary on continuous frequencies, since nature never poses the frequencies on the pre-determined grid, no matter how fine the grid is (Chi et al., 2011; Duarte & Baraniuk, 2012). This issue, known as basis mismatch between the true frequencies and the discretized grid, results in loss of sparsity due to spectral leakage along the Dirichlet kernel, and hence degeneration in the performance of CS algorithms. While one might impose finer gridding to mitigate this weakness, this approach often leads\nto numerical instability and high correlation between dictionary elements, which significantly weakens the advantage of these CS approaches (Tang et al., 2012).\nIn this paper, we explore the above spectral compressed sensing problem, which aims to recover a spectrally sparse object from a small set of time-domain samples. The underlying (possibly multi-dimensional) frequencies can assume any value in the unit disk, and need to be recovered with infinite precision. To address this problem, we develop a nonparametric algorithm, called enhanced matrix completion (EMaC), based on structured matrix completion. Specifically, EMaC starts by converting the data samples into an enhanced matrix with (K-fold) Hankel structures, and then solves a nuclear-norm minimization program to complete the enhanced matrix. We show that, under mild incoherence conditions, EMaC admits exact recovery from O(r log2 n) random samples, where r and n denote respectively the spectral sparsity and the ambient dimension. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantee for the low-rank Hankel matrix completion problem, which is of great importance in control, natural language processing, computer vision, etc. To the best of our knowledge, our results provide the first theoretical bounds that are close to the information theoretic limit. Furthermore, numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm is robust against noise and is applicable to the problem of super resolution."}, {"heading": "2. Connection to Prior Art", "text": "The spectral compressed sensing problem is closely related to harmonic retrieval, which seeks to extract the underlying frequencies of an object from a collection of its time-domain samples. This spans many signal processing applications including radar localization systems (Nion & Sidiropoulos, 2010), array imaging systems (Borcea et al., 2002), wireless channel sensing (Sayeed & Aazhang, 1999; Gedalyahui et al., 2011), etc. In fact, if the time-domain representation of an object can be estimated accurately, then its underlying frequencies can be identified using harmonic super-resolution methods.\nConventional approaches for these problems, such as ESPRIT (Roy & Kailath, 1989) and the matrix pencil method (Hua, 1992), are based on the eigenvalue decomposition of covariance matrices constructed from equi-spaced samples, which can accommodate infinite frequency precision. One weakness of these techniques lies in that they require prior information on the model order, that is, the number of underlying frequency spikes or, at least, an estimate of it. Besides, their performance largely depends on the knowledge of noise spectra; some of them are unstable in the presence of\nnoise and outliers (Dragotti et al., 2007).\nNonparametric algorithms based on convex optimization differ from the above parametric techniques in that the model order does not need to be specified a priori. Recently, Cand\u00e8s and Fernandez-Granda (2013) proposed a total-variation minimization algorithm to super-resolve a sparse object from frequency samples at the low end of its spectrum. This algorithm allows accurate super-resolution when the point sources are appropriately separated, and is stable against noise (Candes & Fernandez-Granda, 2012). Inspired by this approach, Tang et. al. (2012) developed an atomic norm minimization algorithm for line spectral estimation from O(r log r logn) time domain samples. This work is limited to 1-D frequency models and assumes randomness in the data model.\nIn contrast, our approach can accommodate multidimensional frequencies, and only assumes randomness in the observation basis. The algorithm is inspired by the recent advances of matrix completion (MC) problem, which aims at recovering a low-rank matrix from partial entries. It has been shown (Candes & Recht, 2009; Gross, 2011) that exact recovery is possible via nuclear norm minimization, as soon as the number of observed entries is on the order of the information theoretic limit. Encouragingly, this line of algorithms is also robust against noise and outliers (Negahban & Wainwright, 2012). Nevertheless, the theoretical guarantees of these algorithms do not apply to the more structured observation models associated with Hankel structure. Consequently, direct application of existing MC results yields pessimistic bounds on the number of samples, which is far beyond the degrees of freedom underlying the sparse object.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 3 describes the data model and the EMaC algorithm. Section 4 presents the theoretical guarantee of EMaC, with a proof outlined in the Appendix. Numerical validation of EMaC is given in Section 5. We then discuss the extension to low-rank Hankel matrix completion in Section 6, and conclude the paper in Section 7."}, {"heading": "3.

Enhanced Matrix Completion (EMaC)", "text": "One might naturally attempt recovery by applying the matrix completion algorithms (Candes & Recht, 2009) on the original data matrix, arguing that when r is small, perfect recovery of X is possible from partial measurements.

However, generic matrix completion algorithms (Gross, 2011) require at least the order of rmax (n1, n2) samples, which far exceeds the degrees of freedom (which is O (r logn) due to a coupon collector\u2019s effect) in our problem. What is worse, when r > min (n1, n2) (which is possible since r can be as large as n1n2), X is no longer low-rank. This motivates us to construct other forms (e.g. Hua (1992)) that better capture the harmonic structure.\nSpecifically, we adopt an effective enhanced form of X based on 2-fold Hankel structure as follows. The enhanced matrix Xe with respect to X is defined as a k1 \u00d7 (n1 \u2212 k1 + 1) block Hankel matrix\nXe :=\n\n    X0 X1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Xn1\u2212k1 X1 X2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Xn1\u2212k1+1 ... ... ...\n...

The effectiveness of the enhanced form relies on the shift-invariance of harmonic structures (any k consecutive samples lies in the same subspace), which promotes the use of Hankel matrices.\nOne can now see that Xe is low-rank or, rank (Xe) \u2264 r.

The frequency pairs can be spread out (e.g. when their locations are generated in some random fashion), or minimally separated (e.g. when they are small perturbation of a fine grid).\nCondition (11) can be satisfied when the total energy of each skew diagonal of UV \u2217 is proportional to the dimension of this skew diagonal. This is indeed a weaker condition than the one introduced in (Candes & Recht, 2009) for matrix completion, which requires uniform energy distribution over all entries of UV \u2217. For instance, an ideal \u00b52 can often be obtained when the complex phase of all frequencies are generated in some random fashion.\nCondition (12) is an incoherence measure based on the (K-fold) Hankel structures. For example, one can reason that a desired \u00b53 can be obtained if the magnitude of all entries of UU\u2217AaV V \u2217 is mostly even. Condition (10) and (12) depend only on the frequency pairs. In fact, one can verify that UU\u2217 = EL (E\u2217LEL) \u22121 E\u2217 L and V V \u2217 = E\u2217 R (ERE \u2217 R )\u22121 ER, which depend only on the locations of the frequency pairs.

The empirical success rate is reflected by the color of each cell. It can be seen that the number of samples m grows approximately linearly with respect to the spectral sparsity r, in line with our theoretical guarantee in Theorem 1. This phase transition diagram validates the practical applicability of our algorithm in the noiseless setting."}, {"heading": "5.2. Stable Recovery via Singular Value Thresholding", "text": "The above experiments were conducted using the advanced semidefinite programming solver SDPT3. This and many other popular solvers (like SeDuMi) are based on interior point methods, which are typically inapplicable to large-scale data. In fact, SDPT3 fails to handle an n \u00d7 n data matrix when n exceeds 19, which corresponds to a 100\u00d7 100 enhanced matrix. One solution for large-scale data is the first-order algorithms tailored for MC problems, e.g. the singular value thresholding (SVT) algorithm developed in (Cai et al., 2010). We propose a modified SVT algorithm in Algorithm 1 to exploit the Hankel structure.\nIn particular, D\u03c4t(\u00b7) in Algorithm 1 denotes singular value shrinkage operator. Specifically, if the SVD ofX is given by X = U\u03a3V \u2217 with \u03a3 = diag ({\u03c3i}), then\nD\u03c4t (X) := Udiag ({ (\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c4t)+ }) V \u2217.\nAlgorithm 1 Singular Value Thresholding for EMaC\nInput: The observed data matrix Xo on the location set \u2126. initialize let Xoe denote the enhanced form of P\u2126 (Xo); set M0 = Xoe and t = 0. repeat 1) Qt \u2190 D\u03c4t (Mt) 2) Mt \u2190 HXo(Qt) 3) t \u2190 t+ 1 until convergence output X\u0302 as the matrix with enhanced form Mt.\nwhere \u03c4t > 0 is the soft-thresholding level 1. Besides, in the K-dimensional frequency model, HXo(Qt) denotes the projection of Qt onto the subspace of enhanced matrices (i.e. K-fold Hankel matrices) that are consistent with the observed entries. Consequently, at each iteration, a pair (Qt,Mt) is produced by first performing singular value shrinkage and then projecting the outcome onto the space of K-fold Hankel matrices that are consistent with observed entries.\nFig. 2 illustrates the performance of Algorithm 1. We generated a 101\u00d7 101 data matrix X with a superposition of 30 random complex sinusoids, and revealed 5.8% of the total entries (i.e. m = 600) uniformly at random. The noise was i.i.d. Gaussian-distributed giving a signal-to-noise amplitude ratio of 10. The reconstructed signal is superimposed on the ground truth in Fig. 2. The normalized reconstruction error was \u2016X\u0302\u2212X\u2016F/ \u2016X\u2016F = 0.1098, validating the stability of EMaC in the presence of noise.\n1A good soft thresholding level is hard to pick, and needs to be selected by cross validation. Hence, the phase transisions of SVT and EMaC do not necessarily coincide."}, {"heading": "5.3. Super Resolution", "text": "The proposed EMaC algorithm works beyond the random observation model in Theorem 1. Fig. 3 considers a synthetic super resolution example, where the ground truth in Fig. 3 (a) contains 6 point sources with constant amplitude. The low-resolution observation in Fig. 3 (b) is obtained by measuring low-frequency components [\u2212flo, flo] of the ground truth. Due to the large width of the associated point-spread function, both the locations and amplitudes of the point sources are distorted in the low-resolution image.\nWe apply EMaC to extrapolate high-frequency components up to [\u2212fhi, fhi], where fhi/flo = 2. The reconstruction in Fig. 3 (c) is obtained via applying directly inverse Fourier transform of the spectrum to avoid parameter estimation such as the number of modes. The resolution is greatly enhanced from Fig. 3 (b), suggesting that EMaC is a promising approach for super resolution tasks."}, {"heading": "6. Structured Matrix Completion", "text": "One problem closely related to our method is completion of K-fold Hankel matrices from a small number of entries. Consider for instance the 2-D model. While each spectrally sparse signal can be mapped to a lowrank 2-fold Hankel matrix, it is not clear whether all 2-fold Hankel matrices of rank r can be written as the enhanced form of an object with spectral sparsity r. Therefore, one can think of recovery of K-fold Hankel matrices as a more general problem than the spectral compressed sensing problem. Indeed, Hankel matrix completion has found numerous applications in system identification (Fazel et al., 2011), natural language processing (Balle & Mohri, 2012), computer vision (Sankaranarayanan et al., 2010), medical imaging (Shin et al., 2012), etc.\nThere has been several work concerning algorithms and numerical experiments for Hankel matrix completions (Fazel et al., 2003; 2011; Markovsky, 2008). However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been little theoretical guarantee that addresses directly Hankel matrix completion. Our analysis framework in Theorem 1 can be straightforwardly adapted to the general K-fold Hankel matrix completions. Notice that \u00b52 and \u00b53 are defined using the SVD of Xe in (11) and (12), and we only need to modify the definition of \u00b51, as stated in the following theorem.\nTheorem 3 Consider a K-fold Hankel matrix Xe of rank r. The bounds in Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 continue to hold, if the incoherence \u00b51 is defined as the\nsmallest quantity that satisfies: \u2200 (i, l) \u2208 [n1]\u00d7 [n2],\nmax { \u2016UU\u2217A(i,l)\u20162F, \u2016A(i,l)V V \u2217\u20162F } \u2264 \u00b51csr\nn1n2 . (16)\nCondition (16) requires that the left and right singular vectors are sufficiently uncorrelated with the observation basis. In fact, condition (16) is a much weaker assumption than (10).\nIt is worth mentioning that low-rank Hankel matrices can often be converted to low-rank Toeplitz counterparts. Both Hankel and Toeplitz matrices are important forms that capture the underlying harmonic structures. Our results and analysis framework easily extend to the Toeplitz matrix completion problem."}, {"heading": "7. Conclusions", "text": "We present an efficient nonparametric algorithm to estimate a spectrally sparse object from its partial timedomain samples, which poses spectral compressed sensing as a low-rank Hankel structured matrix completion problem. Under mild conditions, our algorithm enables recovery of the multi-dimensional unknown frequencies with infinite precision, which remedies the basis mismatch issue that arises in conventional CS paradigms. To the best of our knowledge, our result on Hankel matrix completion is also the first theoretical guarantee that is close to the information-theoretical limit (up to a logarithmic factor)."}, {"heading": "Appendix: Proof Outline of Theorem 1", "text": "The EMaC method has similar spirit as the well-known matrix completion algorithms (Candes & Recht, 2009; Gross, 2011), however the additional Hankel or blockHankel structures on the matrices make existing theoretical results inapplicable in our framework. Nevertheless, the golfing scheme introduced in (Gross, 2011) lays the foundation of our analysis. We provide here a sketch of the proof, with detailed derivation deferred to (Chen & Chi, 2013) and the supplemental material.\nDenote by T the tangent space with respect to U and V . Let PT be the orthogonal projection onto T , with PT\u22a5 := I \u2212 PT denoting its orthogonal complement. Denote by A(i,l) the orthogonal projection onto the subspace spanned by A(i,l). The projection onto the space spanned by all A(i,l)\u2019s and its complement are defined as\nA := \u2211\n(i,l)\u2208[n1]\u00d7[n2] A(i,l), and A\u22a5 = I \u2212 A. (17)\nSuppose that \u2126 is obtained by sampling with replacement, i.e. \u2126 contains m indices {zi}mi=1 that are i.i.d.\ngenerated from [n1] \u00d7 [n2]. We define the associated projection operators as A\u2126 := \u2211m i=1 Azi , and introduce another projection operator A\u2032\u2126 similar to A\u2126 but with the summation only over distinct samples.\nTo prove exact recovery of EMaC, it is sufficient to produce a dual certificate as follows.\nLemma 2 For a location set \u2126 of size m, suppose that the sampling operator P\u2126 obeys\n\u2225 \u2225 \u2225PTAPT \u2212 n1n2 m PTA\u2126PT \u2225 \u2225 \u2225 \u2264 1 2 . (18)\nIf there exists a matrix W that obeys \n\n\n(A\u2212A\u2032\u2126) (UV \u2217 +W ) = 0, \u2016PT (W )\u2016F \u2264 12n2\n1 n2 2\n, \u2016PT\u22a5 (W )\u2016 \u2264 12 , (19)\nthen Xe is the unique optimizer of EMaC.\nThe dual certificate is constructed via the golfing scheme introduced in (Gross, 2011). Specifically, we generate j0 independent random location sets \u2126j \u223c Bernoulli(q), which is sampled with replacement. Set q such that 1 \u2212 \u03c1 = (1\u2212 q)j0 , where \u03c1 := mn1n2 , then the distribution of \u2126 is the same as \u21261\u222a\u21262\u222a\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u222a\u2126j0 . For small \u03c1, we have q = O (\u03c1/j0) through the Taylor expansion. Consider a small constant \u01eb < 13 . The construction of a dual certificate W proceeds as follows:\n1. Set B0 = 0, and j0 := 3 log1/\u01eb(n1n2).\n2. For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 j0, let\nBi = Bi\u22121 + ( q\u22121A\u2126i +A\u22a5 ) PT (UV \u2217 \u2212Bi\u22121) .\n3. Set W := \u2212 (UV \u2217 \u2212Bj0).\nWe will verify that W is a valid dual certificate satisfying the conditions (19) in Lemma 2. Our construction immediately yields ( A\u2032\u2126 +A\u22a5 ) (Bi) = Bi for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 j0, which gives (A\u2212A\u2032\u2126) (UV \u2217 +W ) = 0. Define Fi := UV \u2217 \u2212Bi, and hence W = Fj0 , one has\nPT (Fi) = ( PTAPT \u2212 q\u22121PTA\u2126iPT ) (Fi\u22121) .\nTo proceed, we present Lemma 3 which shows that A\u2126 is sufficiently incoherent with respect to T .\nLemma 3 There exists a constant c1 > 0 such that if m > c1\u00b51csr log (n1n2), then\n\u2225 \u2225 \u2225 n1n2 m PTA\u2126PT \u2212 PTAPT \u2225 \u2225 \u2225 \u2264 \u01eb (20)\nwith probability exceeding 1\u2212 (n1n2)\u22124.\nUnder the assumptions of Lemma 3, we have\n\u2016PT (W )\u2016F = \u2016PT (Fj0)\u2016F \u2264 \u01ebj0 \u221a r < n\u221221 n \u22122 2 .\nIt remains to show \u2016PT\u22a5 (W )\u2016 \u2264 12 as follows.\nLemma 4 There exist constants c8, c9 > 0 such that if m > c9 max (\u00b51cs, \u00b52, \u00b53) r log 2 (n1n2), then \u22001 \u2264 i \u2264 j0 : \u2225 \u2225PT\u22a5 ( q\u22121A\u2126i +A\u22a5 ) PT (Fi) \u2225 \u2225 < 2\u2212i\u22122 with probability at least 1\u2212 c8(n1n2)\u22123.\nUnder the assumptions of Lemma 4, we have\n\u2016PT\u22a5 (W )\u2016 \u2264 j0\u2211\ni=0\n\u2225 \u2225PT\u22a5 ( q\u22121A\u2126 +A\u22a5 ) PT (Fi) \u2225 \u2225 < 1/2.\nSo far, we have successfully shown that W is a valid dual certificate with high probability, and hence EMaC allows exact recovery with high probability."}], "references": [{"title": "Spectral learning of general weighted automata via constrained matrix completion", "author": ["B.

Specifically, the object of interest with ambient dimension n is assumed to be a mixture of r complex multi-dimensional sinusoids, while the underlying frequencies can assume any value in the unit disk. Conventional compressed sensing paradigms suffer from the basis mismatch issue when imposing a discrete dictionary on the Fourier representation. To address this problem, we develop a novel nonparametric algorithm, called enhanced matrix completion (EMaC), based on structured matrix completion. The algorithm starts by arranging the data into a low-rank enhanced form with multi-fold Hankel structure, then attempts recovery via nuclear norm minimization. Under mild incoherence conditions, EMaC allows perfect recovery as soon as the number of samples exceeds the order of O(r log n). We also show that, in many instances, accurate completion of a low-rank multi-fold Hankel matrix is possible when the number of observed entries is proportional to the information theoretical limits (except for a logarithmic gap). The robustness of EMaC against bounded noise and its applicability to super resolution are further demonstrated by numerical experiments.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
