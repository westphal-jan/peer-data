In every time step t = 1, 2, . . . , T of this sequential decision problem, the learner chooses an action Vt from the finite action set S \u2286 {0, 1}d, where \u2016v\u20161 \u2264 m holds for all v \u2208 S. At the same time, the environment fixes a loss vector \u2113t \u2208 [0, 1]d and the learner suffers loss V \u22a4t \u2113t. We allow the loss vector \u2113t to depend on the previous decisions V1, . . . ,Vt\u22121 made by the learner, that is, we consider non-oblivious environments. The goal of the learner is to minimize the cumulative loss \u2211T\nt=1 V \u22a4 t \u2113t.\nThen, the performance of the learner is measured in terms of the total expected regret\nRT = max v\u2208S E\n[ T\u2211\nt=1\n(Vt \u2212 v)\u22a4 \u2113t ] = E [ T\u2211\nt=1\nV \u22a4t \u2113t\n] \u2212min\nv\u2208S E\n[ T\u2211\nt=1\nv\u22a4\u2113t ] , (1)\nNote that, as indicated in Figure 1, the learner chooses its actions randomly, hence the expectation.\nThe framework described above is general enough to accommodate a number of interesting problem instances such as path planning, ranking and matching problems, finding minimum-weight spanning trees and cut sets. Accordingly, different versions of this general learning problem have drawn considerable attention in the past few years. These versions differ in the amount of information made available to the learner after each round t. In the simplest setting, called the full-information setting, it is assumed that the learner gets to observe the loss vector \u2113t regardless of the choice of Vt. However, this assumption does not hold for many practical applications, so it is more interesting to study the problem under partial information, meaning that the learner only gets some limited feedback based on its own decision. In particular, in some problems it is realistic to assume that the learner observes the vector (Vt,1\u2113t,1, . . . , Vt,d\u2113t,d), where Vt,i and \u2113t,i are the i\nth components of the vectors Vt and \u2113t, respectively. This information scheme is called semi-bandit information. An even more challenging variant is the full bandit scheme where all the learner observes after time t is its own loss V \u22a4t \u2113t.\nThe most well-known instance of our problem is the (adversarial) multiarmed bandit problem considered in the seminal paper of Auer et al. (2002): in each round of this problem, the learner has to select one of N arms and minimize regret against the best fixed arm, while only observing the losses of the chosen arm. In our framework, this setting corresponds to setting d = N and m = 1, and assuming either full bandit or semi-bandit feedback. Among other contributions concerning this problem, Auer et al. propose an algorithm called Exp3 (Exploration and Exploitation using Exponential weights) based on\nconstructing loss estimates \u2113\u0302t,i for each component of the loss vector and playing arm i with probability proportional to exp(\u2212\u03b7\u2211t\u22121s=1 \u2113\u0302s,i) at time t (\u03b7 > 0)4. This algorithm is known as the Exponentially Weighted Average (EWA) forecaster\n4 In fact, Auer et al. mix the resulting distribution with a uniform distribution over the arms with probability \u03b3 > 0. However, this modification is not needed when one is concerned with the total expected regret, see e.g., Barto\u0301k et al. (2011, Chapter 15).\nin the full information case. Besides proving that the total expected regret of this algorithm is O( \u221a NT logN), Auer et al. also provide a general lower bound\nof \u2126( \u221a NT ) on the regret of any learning algorithm on this particular problem. This lower bound was later matched by the Implicitly Normalized Forecaster (INF) of Audibert and Bubeck (2009, 2010) by using the same loss estimates in a more refined way.\nThe most popular example of online learning problems with actual combinatorial structure is the shortest path problem first considered by Takimoto and Warmuth (2003) in the full information scheme. The same problem was considered by Gyo\u0308rgy et al. (2007), who proposed an algorithm that works with semi-bandit information. Since then, we have come a long way in understanding the \u201cprice of information\u201d in online combinatorial optimization\u2014see Audibert et al. (2013) for a complete overview of results concerning all of the presented information schemes. The first algorithm directly targeting general online combinatorial optimization problems is due to Koolen et al. (2010): their method named Component Hedge guarantees an optimal regret of O(m \u221a T log d) in the full information setting. In particular, this algorithm is an instance of the more general algorithm class known as Online Stochastic Mirror Descent (OSMD) or Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) methods. Audibert et al. (2013) show that OSMD/FTRL-based methods can also be used for proving optimal regret bounds of O( \u221a mdT ) for the semi-bandit setting. Finally, Bubeck et al. (2012) show that the natural extension of the EWA forecaster (coupled with an intricate exploration scheme) can be applied to obtain a O(m3/2 \u221a dT log d) upper bound on the regret when assuming full bandit feedback. This upper bound is off by a factor of \u221a m log d from the lower bound proved by Audibert et al. (2013). For completeness, we note that the EWA forecaster attains a regret of O(m3/2 \u221a T log d) in the full information case and O(m \u221a dT log d) in the semibandit case.\nWhile the results outlined above suggest that there is absolutely no work left to be done in the full information and semi-bandit schemes, we get a different picture if we restrict our attention to computationally efficient algorithms. First, methods based on exponential weighting of each decision vector can only be efficiently implemented for a handful of decision sets S\u2014see Koolen et al. (2010) and Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi (2012) for some examples. Furthermore, as noted by Audibert et al. (2013), OSMD/FTRL-type methods can be efficiently implemented by convex programming if the convex hull of the decision set can be described by a polynomial number of constraints. Details of such an efficient implementation are worked out by Suehiro et al. (2012), whose algorithm runs in O(d6) time, which can still be prohibitive in practical problems. While Koolen et al. (2010) list some further examples where OSMD/FTRL can be implemented efficiently, we conclude that results concerning general efficient methods for online combinatorial optimization are lacking for (semi or full) bandit information problems.\nThe Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FPL) prediction method (first proposed by Hannan (1957) and later rediscovered by Kalai and Vempala (2005)) method\noffers a computationally efficient solution for the online combinatorial optimization problem given that the static combinatorial optimization problemminv\u2208S v \u22a4\u2113 admits computationally efficient solutions for any \u2113 \u2208 Rd. FPL, however, is usually relatively overlooked due to many \u201creasons\u201d, some of them listed below:\n\u2013 The best known bound for FPL in the full information setting is O(m \u221a dT ),\nwhich is worse than the bounds for both EWA and OSMD/FTRL. However, this result was recently improved to O(m2 \u221a T polylog d) by Devroye et al.\n(2013). \u2013 It is commonly believed that the standard proof techniques for FPL do not\napply directly against adaptive adversaries (see, e.g, the comments of Audibert et al. (2013, Section 2.3) or Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi (2006, Section 4.3)). On the other hand, a direct analysis for non-oblivious adversaries is given by Poland (2005) in the multi-armed bandit setting. \u2013 Considering bandit information, no efficient FPL-style algorithm is known to achieve a regret of O( \u221a T ). Awerbuch and Kleinberg (2004) and McMahan\nand Blum (2004) proposed FPL-based algorithms for learning with full bandit feedback in shortest path problems, and proved O(T 2/3) bounds on the regret (1). Poland (2005) proved bounds of O( \u221a NT logN) in the N -armed bandit setting, however, the proposed algorithm requires O(T 2) computations per time step.\nIn this paper, we offer an efficient FPL-based algorithm for regret minimization under semi-bandit feedback. Our approach relies on a novel method for estimating components of the loss vector. The method, called geometric resampling (GR), is based on the idea that the reciprocal of the probability of an event can be estimated by measuring the reoccurrence time. We show that the regret of FPL coupled with GR attains a regret of O(m \u221a dT log d) in the semi-bandit case. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first computationally efficient learning algorithm for this learning problem. As a side result, we also improve the regret bounds of FPL in the full information setting to O(m3/2 \u221a T log d), that is, we close the gaps between the performance bounds of FPL and EWA under both full information and semi-bandit feedback."}, {"heading": "2 Loss estimation by geometric resampling", "text": "For a gentle start, consider the problem of regret minimization in N -armed bandits where d = N , m = 1 and the learner has access to the basis vectors {ei}di=1. In each time step, the learner specifies a distribution pt over the arms, where pt,i = P [It = i| Ft\u22121], where Ft\u22121 is the history of the learner\u2019s observations and choices up to the end of time step t\u2212 1. Most bandit algorithms rely on feeding some loss estimates to a black-box prediction algorithm. It is commonplace to consider loss estimates of the form\n\u2113\u0302t,i = \u2113t,i pt,i I {It = i} , (2)\nwhere pt,i = P [It = i |Ft\u22121 ], where Ft\u22121 is the history of observations and internal random variables used by the algorithm up to time t\u2212 1. It is very easy to show that \u2113\u0302t,i is an unbiased estimate of the loss \u2113t,i for all t, i such that pt,i\nis positive. For all other i and t, E [ \u2113\u0302t,i \u2223\u2223\u2223Ft\u22121 ] = 0 \u2264 \u2113t,i.\nTo our knowledge, all existing bandit algorithms utilize some version of the loss estimates described above. While for many algorithms (such as the Exp3 algorithm of Auer et al. (2002) and the Green algorithm of Allenberg et al. (2006)), the probabilities pt,i are readily available and the estimates (2) can be computed efficiently, this is not necessarily the case for all algorithms. In particular, FPL is notorious for not being able to handle bandit information efficiently since the probabilities pt,i cannot be expressed in closed form. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a different loss estimate that can be efficiently computed even when pt,i is not available for the learner.\nThe estimation procedure executed after each time step t is described below.\n1. The learner draws It \u223c pt. 2. For n = 1, 2, . . .\n(a) Let n \u2190 n+ 1. (b) Draw I \u2032t(n) \u223c pt. (c) If I \u2032t(n) = It, break.\n3. Let Kt = n.\nClearly, Kt is a geometrically distributed random variable given It and Ft\u22121. Consequently, we have E [Kt |Ft\u22121, It ] = 1/pt,It . We use this property to construct the estimates\n\u2113\u0302t,i = \u2113t,iI {It = i}Kt (3)\nfor all arms i. We can easily show that the above estimate is conditionally unbiased whenever pt,i > 0:\nE [ \u2113\u0302t,i \u2223\u2223\u2223Ft\u22121 ] = \u2211\nj\npt,jE [ \u2113\u0302t,i \u2223\u2223\u2223Ft\u22121, It = j ]\n= pt,iE [\u2113t,iKt |Ft\u22121, It = i ] = pt,i\u2113t,iE [Kt |Ft\u22121, It = i ] = \u2113t,i.\nClearly E [ \u2113\u0302t,i \u2223\u2223\u2223Ft\u22121 ] = 0 still holds whenever pt,i = 0.\nThe main problem with the above sampling procedure is that its worstcase running time is unbounded: while the expected number of necessary samples Kt is clearly N , the actual number of samples might be much larger. To overcome this problem, we maximize the number of samples by M and use K\u0303t = min {Kt,M} instead of Kt in (3). While this capping obviously introduces some bias, we will show later that for appropriate values of M , this bias does not hurt the performance too much.\nAlgorithm 1: FPL with GR\nInput: S = {v(1),v(2), . . . ,v(N)} \u2286 {0, 1}d, \u03b7 \u2208 R+, M \u2208 Z+; Initialization: L\u0302(1) = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = L\u0302(d) = 0; for t=1,. . . ,T do\nDraw Z(1), . . . ,Z(d) independently from distribution Exp(\u03b7);\nChoose action I = argmin i\u2208{1,2,...,N}\n{ v(i)\u22a4 ( L\u0302\u2212Z )} ;\nK(1) = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = K(d) = M ; k = 0; /* Counter for reoccurred indices */ for n=1,. . . ,M-1 do /* Geometric Resamplig */\nDraw Z\u2032(1), . . . ,Z\u2032(d) independently from distribution Exp(\u03b7);\nI(n) = argmin i\u2208{1,2,...,N}\n{ v(i)\u22a4 ( L\u0302\u2212Z\u2032 )} ;\nfor j=1,. . . ,d do\nif v(I(n))(j) = 1 & K(j) = M then K(j) = n; k = k + 1; if k =\n\u2225\u2225v(I) \u2225\u2225 1 then break; /* All indices reoccurred */\nend\nend\nend\nfor j=1,. . . ,d do L\u0302(j) = L\u0302(j) +K(j)v(I)(j)\u2113(j) ; /* Update */\nend"}, {"heading": "3 An efficient algorithm for learning with semi-bandit feedback", "text": "First, we generalize the geometric resampling method for constructing loss estimates in the semi-bandit case. To this end, let pt,i = P [It = i |Ft\u22121 ] and qt,j = E [Vt,j |Ft\u22121 ]. First, the learner plays the decision vector with index It \u223c pt. Then, it draws M additional indices I \u2032t(1), I \u2032t(2), . . . , I \u2032t(M) \u223c pt independently of each other and It.

However, sampling the indices I \u2032t(1), I \u2032 t(2), . . . , I \u2032 t(M) can be carried out by drawing additional perturbation vectors Z \u2032t(1),Z \u2032 t(2), . . . ,Z \u2032 t(M) independently from the same distribution as Zt. We emphasize that the above additional indices are never actually played by the algorithm, but are only necessary for constructing the loss estimates. We also note that in general, drawing as much as M samples is usually not necessary since the sampling procedure can be terminated as soon as the values of Kt,i are fixed for all i such that Vt,i = 1. We point the reader to Section 3.1 for a more detailed discussion of the running time of the sampling procedure.\nPseudocode for the algorithm can be found in Algorithm 1. We start analyzing our method by proving a simple lemma on the bias of the estimates.\nLemma 1.

While the main ingredients of the proof presented below are rather common (we borrow several ideas from Poland (2005), the proofs of Theorems 3 and 8 of Audibert et al. (2013) and the proof of Corollary 4.5 in Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi (2006)), these elements are carefully combined in our proof to get the desired result.\nProof. Let Z\u0303 be a perturbation vector drawn independently from the same distribution as Z1 and\nI\u0303t = argmin i\u2208{1,2,...,N}\n{ v(i)\u22a4 ( L\u0302t \u2212 Z\u0303 )} .\nIn what follows, we will crucially use that V\u0303t = v(I\u0303t) and Vt+1 = v(It+1) are conditionally independent and identically distributed given Fs for any s \u2265 t. In particular, introducing the notations\nqt,k = E [Vt,k| Ft\u22121] q\u0303t,k = E [ V\u0303t,k \u2223\u2223\u2223Ft ] pt,i = P [It = i| Ft\u22121] p\u0303t,i = P [ I\u0303t = i \u2223\u2223\u2223Ft ] ,\nwe will exploit the above property by using qt,k = q\u0303t\u22121,k and pt,i = p\u0303t\u22121,i numerous times below.\nFirst, let us address the bias of the loss estimates generated by GR. By Lemma 1, we have that E [ \u2113\u0302t,k \u2223\u2223\u2223Ft\u22121 ] \u2264 \u2113t,k for all k and t, and thus E [ v\u22a4\u2113\u0302t \u2223\u2223\u2223Ft\u22121 ] \u2264 v\u22a4\u2113t holds for any fixed v \u2208 S. Furthermore, we have\nE [ V\u0303 \u22a4t\u22121\u2113\u0302t \u2223\u2223\u2223Ft\u22121 ] = E\n[ d\u2211\nk=1\nV\u0303t\u22121,k \u2113\u0302t,k \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Ft\u22121 ]\n=\nd\u2211\nk=1\nq\u0303t\u22121,kE [ \u2113\u0302t,k \u2223\u2223\u2223Ft\u22121 ]\n=\nd\u2211\nk=1\nq\u0303t\u22121,k ( 1\u2212 (1 \u2212 qt,k)M ) \u2113t,k,\nwhere we used the fact that V\u0303t\u22121 is independent of \u2113\u0302t in the second line and Lemma 1 in the last line. Now using that q\u0303t\u22121,k = qt,k for all k and t and noticing that E [ V \u22a4t \u2113t \u2223\u2223Ft\u22121 ] = \u2211d k=1 qt,k\u2113t,k, we get that\nE [ V \u22a4t \u2113t \u2223\u2223Ft\u22121 ] \u2264 E [ V\u0303 \u22a4t\u22121\u2113\u0302t \u2223\u2223\u2223Ft\u22121 ] + d\u2211\ni=1\nqt,k(1 \u2212 qt,k)M .

Instead, we always keep sampling until the desired 1 reoccurs.\nAt time step t, for a given coordinate k with 1, the expected number of samples needed is 1/qt,k, while the probability of coordinate k being 1 is qt,k.

We have proved that the regret of our algorithm is O(m \u221a dT log d) in this setting, and have also shown that FPL can achieve O(m3/2 \u221a T log d) in the full information case when tuned properly. While these bounds are off by a factor of \u221a m log d and \u221a m from the respective minimax results, they exactly match the best known regret bounds for the well-studied Exponentially Weighted Forecaster (EWA). Whether the gaps mentioned above can be closed for FPL-style algorithms (e.g., by using more intricate perturbation schemes) remains an important open question. Nevertheless, we regard our contribution as a significant step towards understanding the inherent trade-offs between computational efficiency and performance guarantees in online combinatorial optimization and, more generally, in online linear optimization.\nThe efficiency of our method rests on a novel loss estimation method called geometric resampling (GR). Obviously, this estimation method is not specific to the proposed learning algorithm. While GR has no immediate benefits for OSMD/FTRL-type algorithms where the probabilities qt,k are readily available, it is possible to think about problem instances where EWA can be efficiently implemented while the values of qt,k are difficult to compute. A particular online learning problem where GR can be useful is the problem of online learning in Markovian decision processes (Neu et al., 2010a,b), where computing qt,k can be computationally expensive when the underlying Markovian environment is complicated. This computational burden can be lightened by using GR if the learner has access to a generative model of the environment.6\nThe most important open problem left is the case of efficient online linear optimization with full bandit feedback. Learning algorithms for this problem usually require that the pseudoinverse of the covariance matrix Pt = E [ VtV \u22a4 t \u2223\u2223Ft\u22121 ] is readily available for the learner at each time step (see, e.g., McMahan and Blum 2004; Bartlett et al. 2008; Dani et al. 2008; Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi 2012; Bubeck et al. 2012). While for most problems, this inverse matrix cannot be computed efficiently, it can be efficiently approximated by geometric resampling when Pt is positive definite as the limit of the matrix geometric series\u2211\u221e\nn=1(I\u2212Pt)n. While this knowledge should be enough to construct an efficient FPL-based method for online combinatorial optimization under full bandit feedback, we have to note that the analysis presented in this paper does not carry through directly in this case: as usual loss estimates might take negative values in the full bandit setting, proving a bound similar to Equation (7) cannot be performed in the presented manner."}, {"heading": "6 In particular, for an MDP with state and action spaces X and A and worst-case", "text": "mixing time \u03c4 > 0, computing the probabilities qt,k can take up to O(|X |3|A|) time, GR returns sufficiently good estimates by generating O(|X ||A|) trajectories of length \u03c4 .
