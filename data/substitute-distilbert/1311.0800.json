MAB algorithms rank results of search engines (Radlinski et al., 2008; Yue and Joachims, 2009), choose between stories or ads to\n\u2217Most of this work was done while the author was at Yahoo Labs, Haifa.\nshowcase on web sites (Agarwal et al., 2008; Chakrabarti et al., 2008), accelerate model selection and stochastic optimization tasks (Maron and Moore, 1994; Mnih et al., 2008), and more. In many of these applications, the workload is simply too high to be handled by a single processor. In the web context, for example, the sheer volume of user requests and the high rate at which they arrive, require websites to use many front-end machines that run in multiple data centers. In the case of model selection tasks, a single evaluation of a certain model or configuration might require considerable computation time, so that distributing the exploration process across several nodes may result with a significant gain in performance. In this paper, we study such large-scale MAB problems in a distributed environment where learning is performed by several independent nodes that may take actions and observe rewards in parallel.\nFollowing recent MAB literature (Even-Dar et al., 2006; Audibert et al., 2010; Gabillon et al., 2011; Karnin et al., 2013), we focus on the problem of identifying a \u201cgood\u201d bandit arm with high confidence. In this problem, we may repeatedly choose one arm (corresponding to an action) and observe a reward drawn from a probability distribution associated with that arm. Our goal is to find an arm with an (almost) optimal expected reward, with as few arm pulls as possible (that is, minimize the simple regret (Bubeck et al., 2009)). Our objective is thus explorative in nature, and in particular we do not mind the incurred costs or the involved regret. This is indeed the natural goal in many applications, such as in the case of model selection problems mentioned above. In our setup, a distributed strategy is evaluated by the number of arm pulls per node required for the task, which correlates with the parallel speed-up obtained by distributing the learning process.\nWe abstract a distributed MAB system as follows. In our model, there are k players that correspond to k independent machines in a cluster. The players are presented with a set of arms, with a common goal of identifying a good arm. Each player receives a stream of queries upon each it chooses an arm to pull. This stream is usually regulated by some load balancer ensuring the load is roughly divided evenly across players. To collaborate, the players may communicate with each other. We assume that the bandwidth of the underlying network is limited, so that players cannot simply share every piece of information. Also, communicating over the network might incur substantial latencies, so players should refrain from doing so as much as possible. When measuring communication of a certain multi-player protocol we consider the number of communication rounds it requires, where in a round of communication each player broadcasts a single message (of arbitrary size) to all other players. Round-based models are natural in distributed learning scenarios, where frameworks such as MapReduce (Dean and Ghemawat, 2008) are ubiquitous.\nWhat is the tradeoff between the learning performance of the players, and the communication between them? At one extreme, if all players broadcast to each other each and every arm reward as it is observed, they can simply simulate the decisions of a serial, optimal algorithm. However, the communication load of this strategy is of course prohibitive. At the other extreme, if the players never communicate, each will suffer the learning curve of a single player, thereby avoiding any possible speed-up the distributed system may provide. Our goal in this work is to better understand this tradeoff between inter-player communication\nand learning performance. Considering the high cost of communication, perhaps the simplest and most important question that arises is how well can the players learn while keeping communication to the very minimum. More specifically, is there a non-trivial strategy by which the players can identify a \u201cgood\u201d arm while communicating only once, at the end of the process? As we discuss later on, this is a non-trivial question. On the positive side, we present a k-player algorithm that attains an asymptotic parallel speed-up of \u221a k factor, as compared to the conventional, serial setting. In fact, our approach demonstrates how to convert virtually any serial exploration strategy to a distributed algorithm enjoying such speed-up. Ideally, one could hope for a factor k speed-up in learning performance; however, we show a lower bound on the required number of pulls in this case, implying that our \u221a k speed-up is essentially optimal. At the other end of the trade-off, we investigate how much communication is necessary for obtaining the ideal factor k parallel speed-up. We present a k-player strategy achieving such speed-up, with communication only logarithmic in 1/\u03b5. As a corollary, we derive an algorithm that demonstrates an explicit trade-off between the number of arm pulls and the amount of inter-player communication."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related Work", "text": "Recently there has been an increasing interest in distributed and collaborative learning problems. In the MAB literature, several recent works consider multi-player MAB scenarios in which players actually compete with each other, either on arm-pulls resources (Gabillon et al., 2011) or on the rewards received (Liu and Zhao, 2010). In contrast, we study a collaborative multi-player problem and investigate how sharing observations helps players achieve their common goal. The related work of Kanade et al. (2012) in the context of non-stochastic (i.e. adversarial) experts also deals with a collaborative problem in a similar distributed setup, and examine the trade-off between communication and the cumulative regret.\nAnother line of recent work was focused on distributed stochastic optimization (Duchi et al., 2010; Agarwal and Duchi, 2011; Dekel et al., 2012) and distributed PACmodels (Balcan et al., 2012; Daume\u0301 III et al., 2012b,a), investigating the involved communication trade-offs. The techniques developed there, however, are inherently \u201cbatch\u201d learning methods and thus are not directly applicable to our MAB problem which is online in nature. Questions involving network topology (Duchi et al., 2010; Dekel et al., 2012) and delays (Agarwal and Duchi, 2011) are relevant to our setup as well; however, our present work focuses on establishing the first non-trivial guarantees in a distributed collaborative MAB setting."}, {"heading": "2 Problem Setup and Statement of Results", "text": "In our model of the Distributed Multi-Armed Bandit problem, there are k \u2265 1 individual players. The players are given n arms, enumerated by [n] := {1, 2, . . . , n}. Each arm i \u2208 [n] is associated with a reward, which is a [0, 1]-valued random variable with expectation pi.\nFor convenience, we assume that the arms are ordered by their expected rewards, that is p1 \u2265 p2 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 pn. At every time step t = 1, 2, . . . , T , each player pulls one arm of his choice and observes an independent sample of its reward. Each player may choose any of the arms, regardless of the other players and their actions. At the end of the game, each player must commit to a single arm. In a communication round, that may take place at any predefined time step, each player may broadcast a message to all other players. While we do not restrict the size of each message, in a reasonable implementation a message should not be larger than O\u0303(n) bits.\nIn the best-arm identification version of the problem, the goal of a multi-player algorithm given some target confidence level \u03b4 > 0, is that with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4 all players correctly identify the best arm (i.e. the arm having the maximal expected reward). For simplicity, we assume in this setting that the best arm is unique. Similarly, in the (\u03b5, \u03b4)-PAC variant the goal is that each player finds an \u03b5-optimal (or \u201c\u03b5-best\u201d) arm, that is an arm i with pi \u2265 p1\u2212\u03b5, with high probability. In this paper we focus on the more general (\u03b5, \u03b4)-PAC setup, which also includes best-arm identification for \u03b5 = 0.\nWe use the notation \u2206i := p1 \u2212 pi to denote the suboptimality gap of arm i, and occasionally use \u2206\u22c6 := \u22062 for denoting the minimal gap. In the best-arm version of the problem, where we assume that the best arm is unique, we have \u2206i > 0 for all i > 1. When dealing with the (\u03b5, \u03b4)-PAC setup, we also consider the truncated gaps \u2206\u03b5i := max{\u2206i, \u03b5}. In the context of MAB problems, we are interested in deriving distribution-dependent bounds, namely, bounds that are stated as a function of \u03b5, \u03b4 and also the distribution-specific values \u2206 := (\u22062, . . . ,\u2206n). The O\u0303 notation in our bounds hides polylogarithmic factors in n, k, \u03b5, \u03b4, and also in \u22062, . . . ,\u2206n. In the case of serial exploration algorithms (i.e., when there is only one player), the lower bounds of Mannor and Tsitsiklis (2004) and Audibert et al. (2010) show that in general \u2126\u0303(H\u03b5) pulls are necessary for identifying an \u03b5-arm, where\nH\u03b5 :=\nn \u2211\ni=2\n1\n(\u2206\u03b5i ) 2 . (1)\nIntuitively, the hardness of the task is therefore captured by the quantity H\u03b5, which is roughly the number of arm pulls needed to find an \u03b5-best arm with a reasonable probability; see also (Audibert et al., 2010) for a discussion. Our goal in this work is therefore to establish bounds in the distributed model that are expressed as a function of H\u03b5, in the same vein of the bounds known in the classic MAB setup1."}, {"heading": "2.1 Baseline approaches", "text": "We now discuss several baseline approaches for the problem, starting with our main focus\u2014 the single round setting. The first obvious approach, already mentioned earlier, is the nocommunication strategy: just let each player explore the arms in isolation of the other\n1If one is interested in distribution-free bounds, then the problem at hand is trivial as the (distributed) uniform sampling strategy is optimal in this setting, up to polylogarithmic factors; see also (Mannor and Tsitsiklis, 2004) for a relevant discussion.\nplayers, following an independent instance of some serial strategy; at the end of the executions, all players hold an \u03b5-best arm. Clearly, this approach performs poorly in terms of learning performance, needing \u2126\u0303(H\u03b5) pulls per player in the worst case and not leading to any parallel speed-up.\nAnother straightforward approach is to employ a majority vote among the players: let each player independently identify an arm, and choose the arm having most of the votes (alternatively, at least half of the votes). However, this approach does not lead to any improvement in performance: for this vote to work, each player has to solve the problem correctly with reasonable probability, which already require \u2126\u0303(H\u03b5) pulls of each. Even if we somehow split the arms between players and let each player explore a share of them, a majority vote would still fail since those players getting the \u201cgood\u201d arms might have to pull arms \u2126\u0303(H\u03b5) times\u2014a small MAB instance might be as hard as the full-sized problem (in terms of the complexity measure H\u03b5).\nWhen considering algorithms employing multiple communication rounds, we use an ideal simulated serial algorithm (i.e., a full-communication approach) as our baseline. This approach is of course prohibited in our context, but is able to achieve the optimal parallel speed-up, linear in the number of players k."}, {"heading": "2.2 Our results", "text": "We now discuss our approach and overview our algorithmic results. These are summarized in Table 1 below, that compares the different algorithms in terms of parallel speed-up and communication.\nOur approach for the one-round case is based on the idea of majority vote. For the bestarm identification task, our observation is that by letting each player explore a smaller set of n/ \u221a k arms chosen at random and choose one of them as \u201cbest\u201d, about \u221a k of the players would come up with the global best arm. This (partial) consensus on a single arm is a key aspect in our approach, since it allows the players to identify the correct best arm among the votes of all k players, after sharing information only once. Our approach leads to a factor \u221a k parallel speed-up which, as we demonstrate in our lower bound, is the optimal factor in this setting. Although our goal here is pure exploration, in our algorithms each player follows an explore-exploit strategy. The idea is that a player should sample his recommended arm as much as his budget permits, even if it was easy to identify in his small-sized problem. This way we can guarantee that the top arms are sampled to a sufficient precision by the time each of the players has to choose a single best arm.\nThe algorithm for the (\u03b5, \u03b4)-PAC setup is similar, but its analysis is more challenging. As mentioned above, an agreement on a single arm is essential for a vote to work. Here, however, there might be several \u03b5-best arms, so arriving at a consensus on a single one is more difficult. Nonetheless, by examining two different regimes, namely when there are \u201cmany\u201d \u03b5-best arms and when there are \u201cfew\u201d of them, our analysis shows that a vote can still work and achieve the \u221a k multiplicative speed-up.\nIn the case of multiple communication rounds, we present a distributed elimination-based algorithm that discards arms right after each communication round. Between rounds, we\nshare the work load between players uniformly. We show that the number of such rounds can be reduced to as low as O(log(1/\u03b5)), by eliminating all 2\u2212r-suboptimal arms in the r\u2019th round. A similar idea was employed in (Auer and Ortner, 2010) for improving the regret bound of UCB with respect to the parameters \u2206i. We also use this technique to develop an algorithm that performs only R communication rounds, for any given parameter R \u2265 1, that achieves a slightly worse multiplicative \u03b52/Rk speed-up."}, {"heading": "3 One Communication Round", "text": "This section considers the most basic variant of the multi-player MAB problem, where each player is only allowed a single transmission, when finishing her queries. For the clarity of exposition, we first consider the best-arm identification setting in Section 3.1. Section 3.2 deals with the (\u03b5, \u03b4)-PAC setup. We demonstrate the tightness of our result in Section 3.3 with a lower bound for the required budget of arm pulls in this setting.\nOur algorithms in this section assume the availability of a serial algorithm A(A, \u03b5), that given a set of arms A and target accuracy \u03b5, identifies an \u03b5-best arm in A with probability at least 2/3 using no more than\ncA \u2211\ni\u2208A\n1\n(\u2206\u03b5i ) 2 log |A| \u2206\u03b5i\n(2)\narm pulls, for some constant cA > 1. For example, the Successive Elimination algorithm (Even-Dar et al., 2006) and the Exp-Gap Elimination algorithm (Karnin et al., 2013) provide a guarantee of this form. Essentially, any exploration strategy whose guarantee is expressed as a function of H\u03b5 can be used as the procedure A, with technical modifications in our analysis."}, {"heading": "3.1 Best-arm Identification Algorithm", "text": "We now describe our one-round best-arm identification algorithm. For simplicity, we present a version matching \u03b4 = 1/3, meaning that the algorithm produces the correct arm with probability at least 2/3; we later explain how to extend it to deal with arbitrary values of \u03b4.\nOur algorithm is akin to a majority vote among the multiple players, in which each player pulls arms in two stages. In the first Explore stage, each player independently solves a \u201csmaller\u201d MAB instance on a random subset of the arms using the exploration strategy A. In the second Exploit stage, each player exploits the arm identified as \u201cbest\u201d in the first stage, and communicates that arm and its observed average reward. See Algorithm 1 below for a precise description. An appealing feature of our algorithm is that it requires each player to transmit a single message of constant size (up to logarithmic factors).\nAlgorithm 1 One-round Best-arm\ninput time horizon T output an arm 1: for player j = 1 to k do 2: choose a subset Aj of 6n/ \u221a k arms uniformly at random\n3: Explore: execute ij \u2190 A(Aj , 0) using at most 12T pulls (and halting the algorithm early if necessary); if the algorithm fails to identify any arm or does not terminate gracefully, let ij be an arbitrary arm 4: Exploit: pull arm ij for 1 2 T times and let q\u0302j be its average reward 5: communicate the numbers ij , q\u0302j 6: end for\n7: let ki be the number of players j with ij = i, and define A = {i : ki > \u221a k} 8: let p\u0302i = (1/ki) \u2211\n{j : ij=i} q\u0302j for all i 9: return argmaxi\u2208A p\u0302i; if the set A is empty, output an arbitrary arm.\nIn Theorem 3.1 we prove that Algorithm 1 indeed achieves the promised upper bound.\nTheorem 3.1. Algorithm 1 identifies the best arm correctly with probability at least 2/3 using no more than\nO\n(\n1\u221a k \u00b7\nn \u2211\ni=2\n1\n\u22062i log\nn\n\u2206i\n)\narm pulls per player, provided that 6 \u2264 \u221a k \u2264 n. The algorithm uses a single communication round, in which each player communicates O\u0303(1) bits.\nBy repeating the algorithm O(log(1/\u03b4)) times and taking the majority vote of the independent runs, we can amplify the success probability to 1\u2212 \u03b4 for any given \u03b4 > 0. Note that\nwe can still do that with one communication round (at the end of all executions), but each player now has to communicate O(log(1/\u03b4)) values2.\nTheorem 3.2. There exists a k-player algorithm that given\nO\n(\n1\u221a k \u00b7\nn \u2211\ni=2\n1\n\u22062i log\nn\n\u2206i log\n1\n\u03b4\n)\narm pulls, identifies the best arm correctly with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4. The algorithm uses a single communication round, in which each player communicates O(log(1/\u03b4)) numerical values.\nWe now prove Theorem 3.1. We show that a budget T of samples (arm pulls) per player, where\nT \u2265 24cA\u221a k\n\u00b7 n \u2211\ni=2\n1\n\u22062i ln\nn\n\u2206i , (3)\nsuffices for the players to jointly identify the best arm i\u22c6 with the desired probability. Clearly, this would imply the bound stated in Theorem 3.1. We note that we did not try to optimize the constants in the above expression.\nWe begin by analyzing the Explore phase of the algorithm. Our first lemma shows that each player chooses the global best arm and identifies it as the local best arm with sufficiently large probability.\nLemma 3.3. When (3) holds, each player identifies the (global) best arm correctly after the Explore phase with probability at least 2/ \u221a k.\nProof. Let\nH = \u2211\ni 6=i\u22c6\n1\n\u22062i ln\nn\n\u2206i\nand for all j,\nHj = \u2211\ni\u22c6 6=i\u2208Aj\n1\n\u22062i ln\nn\n\u2206i .\nThen E[Hj | i\u22c6 \u2208 Aj ] \u2264 6H/ \u221a k by the linearity of expectation, and Markov\u2019s inequality\nthus gives that Pr[Hj \u2264 12H/ \u221a k | i\u22c6 \u2208 Aj ] \u2265 1/2. Clearly, we also have Pr[i\u22c6 \u2208 Aj ] = 6/ \u221a k which implies that\nPr\n[\ni\u22c6 \u2208 Aj and Hj \u2264 12\u221a k H\n]\n\u2265 3\u221a k . (4)\n2In fact, by letting each player pick a slightly larger subset of O( \u221a log(1/\u03b4) \u00b7n/ \u221a k) arms, we can amplify the success probability to 1 \u2212 \u03b4 without needing to communicate more than 2 values per player. However, this approach only works when k = \u2126(log(1/\u03b4)).\nNow consider the \u201clocal\u201d MAB problem facing player j, over the subset of arms Aj . If the (global) best arm i\u22c6 is amongst the arms in Aj, then by eq. (2) the instance of the procedure A player j executes needs no more than\nTj := cA \u2211\ni\u22c6 6=i\u2208Aj\n1\n\u22062i ln\nn\n\u2206i = cAHj\npulls in order to identify i\u22c6 successfully with probability 2/3. In case that Hj \u2264 12H/ \u221a k,\nwe have Tj \u2264 12cAH/ \u221a k \u2264 T/2 , which means that the pulls budget of player j suffices for\nidentifying the best arm. Together with (4), we conclude that with probability at least 2/ \u221a k player j identifies the best arm correctly.\nWe next address the Exploit phase. The next simple lemma shows that the popular arms (i.e. those selected by many players) are estimated to a sufficient precision.\nLemma 3.4. Provided that (3) holds, we have |p\u0302i \u2212 pi| \u2264 12\u2206\u22c6 for all arms i \u2208 A with probability at least 5/6.\nProof. Consider some arm i \u2208 A. The estimate p\u0302i is the average reward of\n1 2 kiT \u2265 12\n\u221a kT \u2265 2\n\u22062\u22c6 ln(12n)\narm pulls (of the Exploit phase). Hoeffding\u2019s inequality now gives that\nPr[|p\u0302i \u2212 pi| > 12\u2206\u22c6] \u2264 2 exp(\u221212\u2206 2 \u22c6 \u00b7 12kiT ) \u2264\n1\n6n ,\nand the lemma follows via a union bound.\nWe can now prove Theorem 3.1.\nProof (of Theorem 3.1). Let us first show that with probability at least 5/6, the best arm i is contained in the set A. To this end, notice that ki\u22c6 is the sum of k i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables {Ij}j where Ij is the indicator of whether player j chooses arm i\u22c6 after the Explore phase. By Lemma 3.3 we have that E[Ij ] \u2265 2/ \u221a k for all j, hence by Hoeffding\u2019s inequality,\nPr[ki\u22c6 \u2264 \u221a k] \u2264 Pr[ki\u22c6 \u2212E[ki\u22c6 ] \u2264 \u2212 \u221a k] \u2264 exp(\u22122k/k) \u2264 1\n6\nwhich implies that i\u22c6 \u2208 A with probability at least 5/6. Next, note that with probability at least 5/6 the arm i \u2208 A having the highest empirical reward p\u0302i is the one with the highest expected reward pi. Indeed, this follows directly from Lemma 3.4 that shows that with probability at least 5/6, for all arms i \u2208 A the estimate p\u0302i is within 1\n2 \u2206 of the true bias pi. Hence, via a union bound we conclude that with probability\nat least 2/3, the best arm is in A and has the highest empirical reward. In other words, with probability at least 2/3 the algorithm outputs the best arm i\u22c6."}, {"heading": "3.2 (\u03b5, \u03b4)-PAC Algorithm", "text": "We now present an algorithm whose purpose is to recover an \u03b5-optimal arm.

In the following, let n\u03b5 and n2\u03b5 denote the number of \u03b5-best and 2\u03b5-best arms respectively. Our analysis considers two different regimes: n2\u03b5 \u2264 150 \u221a k and n2\u03b5 > 1 50 \u221a k, and shows that in any case,\nT \u2265 400cA\u221a k\nn \u2211\ni=2\n1\n(\u2206\u03b5i ) 2 ln\n24n\n\u2206\u03b5i (5)\nsuffices for identifying a 2\u03b5-best arm with the desired probability. Clearly, this implies the bound stated in Theorem 3.5.\nThe first lemma shows that at least one of the players is able to find an \u03b5-best arm. As we later show, this is sufficient for the success of the algorithm in case there are many 2\u03b5-best arms.\nLemma 3.6. When (5) holds, at least one player successfully identifies an \u03b5-best arm in the Explore phase, with probability at least 5/6.\nThe next lemma is more refined and states that in case there are few 2\u03b5-best arms, the probability of each player to successfully identify an \u03b5-best arm grows linearly with n\u03b5. Lemma 3.7. Assume that n2\u03b5 \u2264 150 \u221a k. When (5) holds, each player identifies an \u03b5-best\narm in the Explore phase, with probability at least 2n\u03b5/ \u221a k.\nThe last lemma we need analyzes the accuracy of the estimated rewards of arms in the set A.\nLemma 3.8. With probability at least 5/6, we have |p\u0302i \u2212 pi| \u2264 \u03b5/2 for all arms i \u2208 A. Before proving the lemmas, let us first show how they imply Theorem 3.5.\nProof (of Theorem 3.5). We shall prove that with probability 5/6 the set A contains at least one \u03b5-best arm. This would complete the proof, since Lemma 3.8 assures that with probability 5/6, the estimates p\u0302i of all arms i \u2208 A are at most \u03b5/2-away from the true reward pi, and in turn implies (via a union bound) that with probability 2/3 the arm i \u2208 A having the maximal empirical reward p\u0302i must be a 2\u03b5-best arm.\nFirst, consider the case n2\u03b5 > 1 50\n\u221a k. Lemma 3.6 shows that with probability 5/6 there\nexists a player j that identifies an \u03b5-best arm ij . Since for at least n2\u03b5 arms \u2206i \u2264 2\u03b5, we have\ntij \u2265 12T \u2265 400 2 \u221a k \u00b7 n2\u03b5 \u2212 1 (2\u03b5)2 ln 24n 2\u03b5 \u2265 1 \u03b52 ln(12n) ,\nthat is, ij \u2208 A. Next, consider the case n2\u03b5 \u2264 150 \u221a k. Let N denote the number of players that identified some \u03b5-best arm. The random variable N is a sum of Bernoulli random variables {Ij}j where Ij indicates whether player j identified some \u03b5-best arm. By Lemma 3.7, E[Ij ] \u2265 2n\u03b5/ \u221a k and thus by Hoeffding\u2019s inequality,\nPr[N < n\u03b5 \u221a k] = Pr[N \u2212E[N ] \u2264 \u2212n\u03b5 \u221a k] \u2264 exp(\u22122n2\u03b5) \u2264 1\n6 .\nThat is, with probability 5/6, at least n\u03b5 \u221a k players found an \u03b5-best arm. A pigeon-hole\nargument now shows that in this case there exists an \u03b5-best arm i\u22c6 selected by at least \u221a k players. Hence, with probability 5/6 the number of samples of this arm collected in the Exploit phase is at least\nti\u22c6 \u2265 12 \u221a kT > 1\n\u03b52 ln(12n),\nwhich means that i\u22c6 \u2208 A."}, {"heading": "3.2.1 Proofs of Lemmas", "text": "For the proofs in this section, we need some additional notation.

Consider a MAB problem with two arms and rewards 1 2 + \u03b5, 1 2 \u2212 \u03b5. There exists a constant c such that any algorithm that with probability at least 2/3 identifies the best arm, needs at least c/\u03b52 pulls in expectation. Proof (of Theorem 3.9). Let c1 = \u221a c/2, where c is the constant of Lemma 3.10. Consider a MAB instance over n arms, with the rewards being a random permutation \u03c3 of 1 2 +\u2206, 1 2 \u2212\n\u2206, 0, . . . , 0, where \u2206 := 1/ \u221a n. A serial algorithm of choice (say, the Successive Elimination algorithm) is able to identify the best arm in this setting with probability 2/3 using at most O\u0303(n + 1/\u22062) = O\u0303(n) arm pulls (see e.g., Even-Dar et al. (2006)).\nAssume that the players follow some algorithm, each using no more than c1n/ \u221a k pulls. Without loss of generality, we may assume that the sequence of rewards, as well as the internal random bits of the algorithm (if it is randomized), were drawn before the execution has started. We shall denote this sequence of random variables by h.\nFirst, fix some arbitrary sequence h. Let Ti,j denote the number of times arm i (in decreasing order of rewards) was pulled by player j, and Ti denote the total number of pulls of arm i. Since the budget of each player is c1n/ \u221a k, we have Pr\u03c3[T1,j > 0] \u2264 c1/ \u221a k and consequently\nE\u03c3[T1,j ] \u2264 E\u03c3[T1,j | T1,j > 0] \u00b7 Pr[T1,j > 0] \u2264 c21n\nk\nfor any player j.

For the permutation \u03c30 and its corresponding reward setting, the algorithm does not sample the top two arms enough (in expectation), and by Lemma 3.10 it cannot succeed with probability greater than 2/3."}, {"heading": "4 Multiple Communication Rounds", "text": "In this section we establish an explicit tradeoff between the performance of a multi-player algorithm and the number of communication rounds it uses, in terms of the accuracy \u03b5.

The idea is to eliminate in each round r (i.e., right after the rth communication round) all 2\u2212r-suboptimal arms. We accomplish this by letting each player sample uniformly all remaining arms and communicate the results to other players. Then, players are able to eliminate suboptimal arms with high confidence. If each such round is successful, after log2(1/\u03b5) rounds only \u03b5-best arms survive. Theorem 4.1 below bounds the number of arm pulls used by this algorithm.\nTheorem 4.1.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that the rewards of all arms are drawn before the algorithm is executed, so that the empirical averages p\u0302ri are defined for all arms at all rounds (even for arms that were eliminated prior to some round). Since p\u0302ri is the empirical average of ktr samples of arm i (aggregated from all players), for any round r and arm i we have by Hoeffding\u2019s inequality,\nPr[|p\u0302ri \u2212 pi| \u2265 12\u03b5r] \u2264 2 exp(\u221212\u03b5 2 rktr) =\n\u03b4\n2nr2 .\nHence, a union bound gives that |p\u0302ri \u2212 pi| < \u03b5r/2 for all i and r with probability at least\n1\u2212 \u221e \u2211\nr=1\nn \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b4\n2nr2 = 1\u2212\n\u221e \u2211\nr=1\n\u03b4\n2r2 \u2265 1\u2212 \u03b4 .\nThat is, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, an \u03b5-optimal arm i is never eliminated by the algorithm, as the event p\u0302ri < p\u0302 r \u22c6 \u2212 \u03b5r implies that either p\u0302ri < pi \u2212 \u03b5r/2 or p\u0302rj > pj + \u03b5r/2 for some arm j. In addition, any suboptimal arm i does not survive round ri = \u2308log2(1/\u2206\u03b5i )\u2309+1, since \u2206\u03b5i \u2265 2\u03b5ri and so for r = ri,\np\u0302ri < pi + \u03b5r/2 = p1 + \u03b5r/2\u2212\u2206i \u2264 p\u0302r1 + \u03b5r \u2212\u2206i \u2264 p\u0302r1 \u2212 \u03b5r \u2264 p\u0302r\u22c6 \u2212 \u03b5r .\nThat is, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, after \u2308log2(1/\u03b5)\u2309 + 1 rounds (when the algorithm terminates) all remaining arms are \u03b5-optimal. When \u03b5 = 0, the algorithm terminates once only a single arm survives, and with high probability this occurs after at most \u2308log2(1/\u2206\u22c6)\u2309+1 rounds.\nWe conclude by computing the total number of arms pulls required for the algorithm. Let Ti be the total number of times arm i 6= 1 is pulled by one of the players. Since ri \u2264\nlog2(4/\u2206 \u03b5 i ), we have\nTi \u2264 2 k \u00b7 (2ri)2 ln 4nr\n2 i\n\u03b4\n\u2264 2 k\n(\n4\n\u2206\u03b5i\n)2\nln\n(\n4n\n\u03b4 log22\n4\n\u2206\u03b5i\n)\n= O\n(\n1 k \u00b7 1 (\u2206\u03b5i ) 2 log\n(\nn \u03b4 log 1\n\u2206\u03b5i\n))\n.\nConsequently, the total number of arm pulls per player is T2 + \u2211n\ni=2 Ti, which gives the theorem.\nBy properly tuning the elimination thresholds \u03b5r of Algorithm 3 in accordance with the target accuracy \u03b5, we can establish an explicit trade-off between the number of communication rounds and the number of arm pulls each player needs. In particular, we can design a multi-player algorithm that terminates after at most R communication rounds, for any given parameter R > 0. This, however, comes at the cost of a compromise in learning performance as quantified in the following corollary.\nCorollary 4.2. Given a parameter R > 0, set \u03b5r \u2190 \u03b5r/R for all r \u2265 1 in Algorithm 3. With probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4, the modified algorithm\n\u2022 identifies an \u03b5-best arm using\nO\u0303\n(\n\u03b5\u22122/R\nk \u00b7\nn \u2211\ni=2\n1\n(\u2206\u03b5i ) 2\n)\narm pulls per player;\n\u2022 terminates after at most R rounds of communication.\nProof. For all arms i \u2208 [n], let\nri =\n\u2308\nR 1 + log2(1/\u2206\n\u03b5 i )\nlog2(1/\u03b5)\n\u2309\n.\nSince \u2206i \u2265 2\u03b5ri, if the algorithm is successful any arm i which is not \u03b5ri-optimal is eliminated after at most ri rounds. Clearly, after R rounds only \u03b5-optimal arms survive. This happens with probability at least 1\u2212 \u03b4.\nIt remains to bound the number of arm pulls the algorithm uses. It is easy to verify that 2\u03b5ri \u2265 \u03b51/R \u00b7\u2206\u03b5i , thus the number of times arm i was pulled by each of the players is\nTi = 1 k \u00b7 4 \u03b52ri ln 2nr2i \u03b4 = O\n( \u03b5\u22122/R\nk \u00b7 1 (\u2206\u03b5i ) 2 log nR \u03b4\n)\n,\nand the theorem follows."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions and Further Research", "text": "We have considered a collaborative MAB exploration problem, in which several independent players explore a set of arms with a common goal, and obtained the first non-trivial results in such setting. Our main results apply for the specifically interesting regime where each of the players is allowed a single transmission; this setting fits naturally to common distributed frameworks such as MapReduce. An interesting open question in this context is whether one can obtain a strictly better speed-up result (which, in particular, is independent of \u03b5) by allowing more than a single round. Even when allowing merely two communication rounds, it is unclear whether the \u221a k speed-up can be improved. Intuitively, the difficulty here is that in the second phase of a reasonable strategy each player should focus on the arms that excelled in the first phase; this makes the sub-problems being faced in the second phase as hard as the entire MAB instance, in terms of the quantity H\u03b5. Nevertheless, we expect our oneround approach to serve as a building-block in the design of future distributed exploration algorithms, that are applicable in more complex communication models.\nAn additional interesting problem for future research is how to translate our results to the regret minimization setting. In particular, it would be nice to see a conversion of algorithms like UCB (Auer et al., 2002) to a distributed setting.

Our results demonstrate a non-trivial tradeoff between the number of arm pulls required by each of the players, and the amount of communication between them. In particular, our main result shows that by allowing the k players to communicate only once, they are able to learn \u221a k times faster than a single player. That is, distributing learning to k players gives rise to a factor \u221a k parallel speed-up. We complement this result with a lower bound showing this is in general the best possible.
