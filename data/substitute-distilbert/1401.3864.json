Introduction", "text": "In standard propositional logic, classical entailment does not distinguish among the formulas that do not entail another formula. For example, let x, y and z be three atoms. We have that neither x nor z classically entails x\u2227 y. However, x seems intuitively \u201ccloser\u201d to x\u2227 y than z. The reason is that, x \u2227 y can be considered as the union of two \u201cparts\u201d x and y, and x is exactly one of them. On the other hand, z is completely irrelevant to x \u2227 y.\nThis example motivates us to consider the notion of \u201cpartial entailment\u201d. In comparison with classical entailment, partial entailment intends to capture the \u201cpartial satisfaction\u201d relationship between two formulas with respect to a background theory. In standard propositional logic, that a formula P entails another formula Q with respect to a formula set \u0393 intuitively means that under the circumstance of \u0393, if P is true then Q will also be true. In contrast, that a formula P partially entails another formula Q with respect to a formula set \u0393 intuitively means that, under the circumstance of \u0393, if P is true then some \u201cpart\u201d of Q will also be true. Partial entailment is widely used in everyday life. For example, suppose that a student Laura wants to get score \u201cHD\u201d on the subjects mathematics and physics in the final examination. If she cannot achieve both of them, she could also be satisfied to achieve just one of them. At least, it is better than achieving none.\nLet us consider a further example. Suppose that the background formula set is empty and the objective formula is x \u2227 y. Consider the following four formulas: x, x \u2227 z, x \u2227 \u00acy and z. Clearly, none of these formulas classically entails x\u2227y. However, x, x\u2227 z and x\u2227\u00acy entail x, which can be regarded as a part of x\u2227y. In contrast, z is irrelevant to x\u2227y. Thus, one can conclude that, to some extent, x, x\u2227 z and x\u2227\u00acy \u201cpartially satisfy\u201d x\u2227 y while z does not.\nc\u00a92011 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.\nOne may observe that there exists some difference between x and x \u2227 z in partially satisfying x \u2227 y. That is, x \u2227 z contains a new atom z, which is irrelevant to x \u2227 y. On the other hand, x is exactly a part of x \u2227 y. In other words, x \u2227 z contains \u201cirrelevancy\u201d (namely z) in partially satisfying x \u2227 y while x does not. Another observation is about x \u2227 \u00acy. Although it entails x (a part of x \u2227 y), it also entails \u00acy, which contradicts to y (also a part of x \u2227 y). In other words, x \u2227 \u00acy has some \u201cside effect\u201d (namely \u00acy) besides partially satisfying x \u2227 y.\nThe background theory is crucial for partial entailment. As an example, consider z and x \u2227 y again. Suppose that the background formula set is empty. In this case, z does not partially satisfy x \u2227 y. If the background formula set turns into {z \u2192 x}, then z should partially satisfy x \u2227 y since under the background theory, if z holds, then x holds as well.\nBased on the above observations and intuitions, in this paper, we formalize the notion of partial entailment between two formulas with respect to a background theory in a propositional language. Moreover, we distinguish three different kinds of partial entailments, namely weak partial entailment, partial entailment and strong partial entailment. The intuitions of them are summarized in Table 1. Of course, all of them require partial satisfaction between the two formulas. However, weak partial entailment may allow both irrelevancies and side effects, whilst partial entailment prohibits side effects but still may allow irrelevancies, and strong partial entailment is the strongest one that further prohibits irrelevancies.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we formalize three different kinds of partial entailments by using an extended notion of prime implicant, and discuss their semantic properties. In Section 3, we focus on the computational complexities of decision problems in relation to prime implicant and partial entailments, ranging from some special cases to the most general case. We then compare the notion of partial entailments with related notions in the AI literature in Section 4. In Section 5, we show how the notions of partial entailments can be applied to formalize partial goal satisfaction in reasoning about rational agents. Finally, we draw our conclusions in Section 6."}, {"heading": "2. Partial Entailment", "text": "We restrict our discussions within a propositional language, denoted by L. Formulas in L are composed recursively by a finite set Atom of atoms (also called variables) with {>,\u22a5} and standard connectives \u00ac and \u2192. The connectives \u2227, \u2228, \u2194 are defined as usual. Literals are atoms and their negations. We use lower case letters to denote atoms and literals, upper case letters to denote formulas, lower Greek letters to denote literal sets, and upper Greek\nletters to denote formula sets respectively. We write \u2212l to denote the complementary literal of a literal l, \u2212\u03c0 to denote the set of complementary literals of all literals in \u03c0. We write Atom(l), Atom(P ), Atom(\u03c0) and Atom(\u0393) to denote the sets of atoms occurring in literal l, formula P , literal set \u03c0 and formula set \u0393 respectively.\nWe say that a literal set \u03c0 is an assignment over a set A of atoms (assignment for short if A = Atom) if for each atom x \u2208 A, exactly one of x and \u00acx is in \u03c0. Notice that both a literal l and an assignment \u03c0 can also be considered as formulas. For convenience, henceforth, both l and \u03c0 also denote their corresponding formulas if it is clear from the context. The entailment relation |= and the notion of model are defined in the standard way. A set of formulas is said to be consistent if it has at least one model, otherwise, it is said to be inconsistent. A theory is a set of formulas closed under |=. Let \u0393 be a set of formulas. The deductive closure of \u0393, denoted by Th(\u0393), is the minimal theory (in the sense of set inclusion) containing \u0393. For convenience, we also use \u0393 itself to denote the theory Th(\u0393) if it is clear from the context.\nWe write P |l to denote the formula obtained from P by simultaneously replacing every occurrence of x by > (\u22a5) if l is of the form x (\u00acx). If \u03c0 is a consistent literal set (i.e. 6 \u2203x \u2208 Atom s.t. x \u2208 \u03c0 and \u00acx \u2208 \u03c0), and \u03c0 = {l1, l2, ..., lk}, we write P |\u03c0 to denote the formula (((P |l1)|l2)|...)|lk."}, {"heading": "2.1 A Simple Case", "text": "We begin to define the notions of partial entailments between two formulas with respect to a background formula set by considering a rather simple case. That is, both the two formulas are consistent conjunctions of literals and the background formula set is assumed to be empty.\nDefinition 1 Let \u03c0 and \u03c0\u2032 be two consistent sets of literals.\n\u2022 We say that \u03c0 weakly partially entails \u03c0\u2032 if \u03c0 \u2229 \u03c0\u2032 6= \u2205.\n\u2022 We say that \u03c0 partially entails \u03c0\u2032 if \u03c0 \u2229 \u03c0\u2032 6= \u2205 and \u03c0 \u2229 \u2212\u03c0\u2032 = \u2205.\n\u2022 We say that \u03c0 strongly partially entails \u03c0\u2032 if \u2205 \u2282 \u03c0 \u2286 \u03c0\u2032.\nDefinition 1 simply follows the intuitions presented in the introduction section (see Table 1). In this simple case, \u03c0\u2032 is a consistent set of literals. Thus, the \u201cparts\u201d of \u03c0\u2032 can be regarded as all the elements (or subsets) of \u03c0\u2032. Recall our intuitive sense of partial satisfaction. That is, if \u03c0 holds, then some parts of \u03c0\u2032 hold as well. This means that there exists some part of \u03c0\u2032, which is a subset of \u03c0. Clearly, this can be precisely captured by \u03c0 \u2229 \u03c0\u2032 6= \u2205, which is exactly the definition of weak partial entailment in this simple case.\nFor partial entailment, we forbid side effects based on partial satisfaction. Again, since \u03c0\u2032 is a consistent set of literals, the \u201cside effects\u201d of \u03c0\u2032 can be regarded as all the complementary literal of the elements (or subsets) of \u03c0\u2032. Hence, that \u03c0 has no side effects to \u03c0\u2032 means that \u03c0 does not mention the complementary literal of any elements (or subsets) of \u03c0\u2032. Clearly, this can be precisely captured by \u03c0 \u2229\u2212\u03c0\u2032 = \u2205, where \u2212\u03c0\u2032 is the set of complementary literals of all elements in \u03c0\u2032. Together with \u03c0 \u2229 \u03c0\u2032 6= \u2205, this forms the definition of partial entailment in this simple case.\nFinally, consider strong partial entailment. We require additionally that there is no irrelevancy. The irrelevancies of \u03c0\u2032 can be considered as all those atoms (or literals) not mentioned in \u03c0\u2032. Hence, that \u03c0 has no irrelevancy to \u03c0\u2032 means that there is no atom (or literal) mentioned in \u03c0 but not in \u03c0\u2032. Formally, this can be precisely captured by Atom(\u03c0) \u2286 Atom(\u03c0\u2032) (or \u03c0 \u2286 \u03c0\u2032). Whatever the case is, together with the two conditions \u03c0 \u2229 \u03c0\u2032 6= \u2205 and \u03c0 \u2229 \u2212\u03c0\u2032 = \u2205, this is equivalent to \u03c0 \u2286 \u03c0\u2032 and \u03c0 6= \u2205, which is the definition of strong partial entailment in this simple case.\nExample 1 Recall the example proposed in the introduction section. According to Definition 1, it is easy to check that x, x \u2227 \u00acy and x \u2227 z weakly partially entail x \u2227 y but z does not; x and x \u2227 z partially entail x \u2227 y but x \u2227 \u00acy and z do not; only x strongly partially entails x\u2227 y while x\u2227\u00acy, x\u2227 z and z do not. The results coincide with our intuitions and observations discussed in the introduction section.\nComparing weak partial entailment and partial entailment, one may observe that x\u2227\u00acy weakly partially entails x\u2227y but it does not partially entail x\u2227y. As discussed, this is because \u00acy is a \u201cside effect\u201d to x \u2227 y. Comparing partial entailment and strong partial entailment, one may observe that x \u2227 z partially entails x \u2227 y but it does not strongly partially entail x \u2227 y. Again, this coincides with our discussions since z is an \u201cirrelevancy\u201d to x \u2227 y. 2\nAn interesting phenomenon is about the relationships between partial entailments and classical entailment. In this simple case, it is easy to see that if \u03c0 classically entails \u03c0\u2032, then \u03c0 partially entails \u03c0\u2032. Also, \u03c0 weakly partially entails \u03c0\u2032. This means that classical entailment is a special case of (weak) partial entailment to some extent. However, this does not hold for strong partial entailment. For instance, x \u2227 y classically entails x, but it does not strongly partially entail x since y is an \u201cirrelevancy\u201d with respect to x.\nAt first glance, it seems that this result is strange in the sense that the term of partial entailment should be a generalization of classical entailment. However, this does not mean that classical entailment also prohibits side effects and irrelevancies. Thus, from the intuitive sense, one can only conclude that classical entailment should be a special case of weak partial entailment, but may be mutually different from partial entailment and strong partial entailment. Interestingly, as we will show later, classical entailment indeed prohibits side effects. This means that classical entailment is a special case of partial entailment as well. However, classical entailment may allow irrelevancy (e.g., x\u2227 y classically entails x but y is an irrelevancy to x). Hence, roughly speaking, classical entailment is a special case of both partial entailment and weak partial entailment, but classical entailment and strong partial entailment are mutually different.\nDefinition 1 gives a basic impression on the notions of partial entailments. In the following, we consider to extend the three notions of partial entailments in a general sense, in which the two formulas are arbitrary formulas and the background is an arbitrary set of formulas."}, {"heading": "2.2 Prime Implicant", "text": "In order to define partial entailments in general case, we use Quine\u2019s notion of prime implicant (Quine, 1952), which has been widely used in many areas in logic and computer\nscience. An excellent survey of prime implicant and its dual prime implicate is due to Marquis (2000).\nRoughly speaking, a prime implicant of a formula is a minimal set (in the sense of set inclusion) of literals that entails this formula. The notion of prime implicant can be relativized with respect to a background formula set as follows.\nDefinition 2 (Relativized prime implicant) A literal set \u03c0 is a prime implicant of a formula P with respect to a formula set \u0393 if:\n1. \u0393 \u222a \u03c0 is consistent.\n2. \u0393 \u222a \u03c0 |= P .\n3. There does not exist a literal set \u03c0\u2032 \u2282 \u03c0 that satisfies the above two conditions.\nThe set of all prime implicants of P with respect to \u0393 is denoted by PI(\u0393, P ). For convenience, we omit \u0393 when it is empty.\nIntuitively, a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393 is a minimal set of information needed in order to satisfy P under the circumstance of \u0393. Condition 1 requires that the set of information is \u201cfeasible\u201d, i.e., it must be consistent with the background formula set. Condition 2 means that the set of information is an \u201cimplicant\u201d, i.e., it is indeed powerful enough to satisfy P w.r.t. \u0393. Finally, condition 3 requires that the set of information is \u201cprime\u201d, i.e., it is a minimal set of information for satisfying P w.r.t. \u0393.\nExample 2 According to Definition 2, the only prime implicant of x \u2227 y is {x, y}, while x \u2228 y has two prime implicants, namely {x} and {y}. The background formula set indeed plays an important role. Clearly, x has a unique prime implicant {x}. However, {y} is also a prime implicant of x with respect to the background formula set {y \u2192 x}. 2\nIt is well known that the relativized notion of prime implicant is similar to the notion of logic-based abduction (Eiter & Gottlob, 1995; Selman & Levesque, 1990; Eiter & Makino, 2007). There are different characterizations of abduction in the literature. Here, we consider one of the most well-studied forms (Selman & Levesque, 1990; Eiter & Makino, 2007).\nDefinition 3 (Selman & Levesque, 1990) Let \u0393 be a theory, F a formula and H a set of literals. An (abductive) explanation of F with respect to H from \u0393 is a minimal set \u03c0 \u2286 H such that:\n1. \u0393 \u222a \u03c0 is consistent,\n2. \u0393 \u222a \u03c0 |= F .\nFollowing the above definitions, it can be observed that the relativized notion of prime implicant and abduction can be simply transformed each other. More precisely, suppose that \u0393 is a theory, F a formula and H a set of literals. Let Lit be the set of all literals in the language. Then, \u03c0 is a prime implicant of F w.r.t. \u0393 iff \u03c0 is an abductive explanation of F from \u0393 with respect to Lit. Conversely, \u03c0 is an abductive explanation of F with respect to H from \u0393 iff \u03c0 is a prime implicant of F w.r.t. \u0393 and mentions literals only from H.\nAnother closely related notion to prime implicant is its dual, called prime implicate, which is also of interests in many areas as well. Roughly speaking, a prime implicate of a propositional formula P is a minimal clause (i.e., disjunction of literals) entailed by P . It is easy to see that the conjunction of a set \u03c0 of literals is a prime implicant of a formula P if and only if the disjunction of all the complementary literals of the elements in \u03c0 is a prime implicate of \u00acP . Prime implicate can also be relativized to a background formula set as well (Marquis, 2000). We omit this definition since we are mainly focused on prime implicant in this paper.\nMany properties in relation to prime implicate were discussed and summarized by Marquis (2000). Not surprisingly, similar results hold for prime implicant as well. In the following, we recall some of the important properties in relation to the relativized notion of prime implicant, which will be used later in this paper.\nProposition 1 Let \u0393 be a finite set of formulas, P a formula and \u03c0 a set of literals. \u03c0 is a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393 iff \u0393\u222a\u03c0 is consistent and \u03c0 is a prime implicant of \u2227 \u0393\u2192 P ,\nwhere \u2227 \u0393 is the conjunction of all formulas in \u0393.\nProposition 2 Let P be a formula, \u0393 a set of formulas and \u03c0 a literal set such that \u0393\u222a \u03c0 is consistent and \u0393 \u222a \u03c0 |= P . Then there exists \u03c0\u2032 \u2286 \u03c0 such that \u03c0\u2032 is a prime implicant of P with respect to \u0393.\nProposition 3 Let P be a formula, \u0393 a formula set and \u03c0 a literal set. If \u03c0 is a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393, then there exists an assignment \u03c0\u2032 such that \u03c0 \u2286 \u03c0\u2032 and \u03c0\u2032 is a model of both \u0393 and P .\nTogether with Proposition 2, Proposition 3 indicates the correspondence relationship between all the models of P w.r.t. \u0393 and all the prime implicants of P w.r.t. \u0393. Suppose that \u03c0 is a model of P and is consistent with \u0393. Then, according to Proposition 2, there exists a subset of \u03c0, which is a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393. Conversely, according to Proposition 3, every prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393 can be extended to a model of both \u0393 and P .\nProposition 4 Let P be a formula and \u0393 a set of formulas. \u0393 |= \u00acP if and only if PI(\u0393, P ) = \u2205; \u0393 |= P if and only if PI(\u0393, P ) = {\u2205}.\nProposition 5 Let P and Q be two formulas and \u0393 a set of formulas. \u0393 |= P \u2194 Q iff PI(\u0393, P ) = PI(\u0393, Q).\nTo conclude, the prime implicants of a formula P w.r.t. a formula set \u0393 play two roles.\nCases: On one hand, if there exists an assignment \u03c0 satisfying both \u0393 and P , then according to Proposition 2, there exists a subset of \u03c0 which is a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393. On the other hand, if \u03c0 is a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393, then according to Proposition 3, it can be extended to an assignment satisfying both \u0393 and P . This means that the prime implicants of P w.r.t. \u0393 are corresponding to the possible worlds (assignments) satisfying both \u0393 and P . Intuitively, they are corresponding to all the cases which make P true w.r.t. \u0393, i.e., all the ways to achieve P under \u0393.\nParts: Suppose that \u03c0 is a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393 and l is a literal in \u03c0. Then, \u0393 \u222a \u03c0 |= P and \u0393 \u222a \u03c0\\{l} 6|= P . As mentioned above, \u03c0 can be considered as a way (case) to achieve P w.r.t. \u0393. Then, intuitively, l plays an essential role for achieving P w.r.t. \u0393 via \u03c0. Without l, \u03c0 is no longer a way to achieve P under \u0393. This shows that all the elements in \u03c0 are essential. In other words, \u03c0 is a minimal way to achieve P under \u0393, and none of the elements in \u03c0 can be thrown away. Thus, these literals can be considered as parts of P w.r.t. \u0393.\nBoth roles of prime implicants will be exploited by the notions of partial entailments introduced in the following."}, {"heading": "2.3 Definitions of Partial Entailments", "text": "Based on the notion of prime implicant, we formalize three kinds of partial entailments. From the weakest to the strongest, they are weak partial entailment, partial entailment and strong partial entailment respectively.\nDefinition 4 (Weak partial entailment) A formula P weakly partially entails a formula Q with respect to a formula set \u0393, denoted by P W\u0393 Q, if:\n1. PI(\u0393, P ) is not empty.\n2. For each \u03c0 \u2208 PI(\u0393, P ), there exists \u03c0\u2032 \u2208 PI(\u0393, Q), such that \u03c0 \u2229 \u03c0\u2032 6= \u2205.\nDefinition 5 (Partial entailment) A formula P partially entails a formula Q with respect to a formula set \u0393, denoted by P \u0393 Q, if:\n1. PI(\u0393, P ) is not empty.\n2. For each \u03c0 \u2208 PI(\u0393, P ), there exists \u03c0\u2032 \u2208 PI(\u0393, Q), such that \u03c0\u2229\u03c0\u2032 6= \u2205 and \u03c0\u2229\u2212\u03c0\u2032 = \u2205.\nDefinition 6 (Strong partial entailment) A formula P strongly partially entails a formula Q with respect to a formula set \u0393, denoted by P S\u0393 Q, if:\n1. PI(\u0393, P ) is not empty.\n2. For each \u03c0 \u2208 PI(\u0393, P ), there exists \u03c0\u2032 \u2208 PI(\u0393, Q), such that \u2205 \u2282 \u03c0 \u2286 \u03c0\u2032.\nWe write P 6 W\u0393 Q if it is not the case that P W\u0393 Q, similar for partial entailment and strong partial entailment. For convenience, we omit \u0393 when it is empty.\nClearly, these definitions are generalizations of Definition 1 proposed in Section 2.1 since the unique prime implicant of a literal set is itself. Note that the only difference among these definitions of partial entailments is indeed presented in Section 2.1 in the simple case. Definitions 4-6 all require that for any literal set in PI(\u0393, P ), there exists some literal set in PI(\u0393, Q) such that the two literal sets satisfy the same corresponding relationships presented in Definition 1 respectively.\nLet us take a closer look at condition 2 in Definition 4. Recall our intuitive sense of partial satisfaction again, that is, if P is true under \u0393, then some parts of Q hold as well.\nAs we discussed in Section 2.2, the prime implicants of P w.r.t. \u0393 represent all the cases that make P true under \u0393. Also, the prime implicants of Q w.r.t. \u0393 can capture the idea of \u201cpart\u201d of Q under \u0393. Hence, condition 2 means that, intuitively, for all the cases that P is true under \u0393 (captured by all the prime implicants of P w.r.t. \u0393), there exists a way to achieve Q under \u0393 (captured by a prime implicant of Q w.r.t. \u0393), such that the former partially satisfies the latter (reduced to the simple case in Definition 1). In addition, condition 1 in Definition 4 ensures that there exists at least one such situation. The intuitive senses of Definitions 5 and 6 can be explained in a similar way.\nExample 3 Let the background theory \u0393 be {x \u2228 y, z \u2192 y}. Consider two formulas P = (x \u2227 r) \u2228 (y \u2227 s) and Q = (x \u2227 z) \u2228 (\u00acx \u2227 y \u2227 s). The prime implicants of P w.r.t. \u0393 are as follows: {x, r}, {y, s}, {r, s}, {z, s}, {\u00acy, r} and {\u00acx, s}. Notice that {\u00acy, r} is a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393 although the literal \u00acy even does not occur in P . On the other hand, the prime implicants of Q w.r.t. \u0393 are as follows: {x, z}, {\u00acx, s} and {z, s}. Notice that {\u00acx, y, s} is not a prime implicant of Q w.r.t. \u0393 since {\u00acx, s} is a subset of it and also satisfies Q under \u0393.\nAccording to the definitions, we have that P does not weakly partially entail Q w.r.t. \u0393 since there is a prime implicant {\u00acy, r} of P w.r.t. \u0393 such that it has no intersection with any of the prime implicants of Q w.r.t. \u0393. Also, P does not (strongly) partially entail Q w.r.t. \u0393 either. Conversely, Q (weakly) partially entails P w.r.t. \u0393, whilst it does not strongly partially entail P w.r.t. \u0393. 2\nNote that there are other possible relations between two formulas w.r.t. a background formula set by using the extended notion of prime implicant. In this paper, for defining partial entailments, we use a \u2200\u2203 style definition in the sense that we require that \u201cfor all\u201d literal sets in PI(\u0393, P ), \u201cthere exists\u201d a literal set in PI(\u0393, Q) such that the two literal sets satisfy the conditions in Definition 1 respectively. Recall again the intuition of partial entailments, which requires that in any cases, if P is true under the context of \u0393, then some part of Q is true under the context of \u0393. This naturally suggests the \u2200\u2203 style definition for the definitions of partial entailments (i.e. Definitions 4-6), where the \u201c\u2200\u201d-part captures all the cases of achieving P under the context of \u0393, and the \u201c\u2203\u201d-part associates a possibility of achieving Q under the context of \u0393 to the above case for P . In addition, the condition item 2 in Definitions 4-6 ensures that, in this case, P partially achieves Q w.r.t. \u0393 via the two literal sets.\nThe reason why we choose the \u2200\u2203 style definition for partial entailments can also be explained analogously to classical entailment. Note that a formula P classically entails another formula Q w.r.t. a background theory \u0393 iff for all models of P w.r.t. \u0393, it is also a model of Q w.r.t. \u0393.\nCertainly, there are other possible styles, including \u2200\u2200, \u2203\u2203 and \u2203\u2200. For instance, the \u2203\u2200 style definition in the weakest case should be: \u201cthere exists\u201d \u03c0 \u2208 PI(\u0393, P ) such that \u201cfor all\u201d \u03c0\u2032 \u2208 PI(\u0393, Q), \u03c0 \u2229 \u03c0\u2032 6= \u2205. Although these definitions might be interesting and useful elsewhere, they fail to capture the basic idea of \u201cpartial satisfaction\u201d.\nExample 4 Consider two formulas x\u2228 z and x\u2227 y. The former has two prime implicants, namely {x} and {z}, while the latter has a unique prime implicant, namely {x, y}. If we use the \u2203\u2203 style definition, we have x\u2228z (weakly, strongly) partially entails x\u2227y. However,\nthis is not intuitive because {z} achieves x \u2228 z true but it is irrelevant to x \u2227 y. In other words, the assignment {\u00acx,\u00acy, z} satisfies x \u2228 z but not x \u2227 y. Hence, there exists a case that x \u2228 z is true but none of the parts of x \u2227 y is true.\nConsider the formula x\u2228y, which has two prime implicants, {x} and {y}. If we take the \u2200\u2200 style definition or the \u2203\u2200 one, this formula does not (weakly, strongly) partially entail itself. This is obviously not intuitive. 2\nAnother feasible direction of definitions is to switch the formulas P and Q. For instance, the switched-\u2200\u2203 style definition in the weakest case is: \u201cfor all\u201d \u03c0 \u2208 PI(\u0393, Q), \u201cthere exists\u201d some \u03c0\u2032 \u2208 PI(\u0393, P ) such that \u03c0\u2229\u03c0\u2032 6= \u2205. This definition, and the corresponding switched-\u2203\u2200, \u2203\u2203 and \u2200\u2200 style definitions, fail to capture the basic idea of partial satisfaction either. Again, recall the intuition of partial entailments. That is, if P is true (under the context of \u0393), then some part of Q is true as well (under the context of \u0393). Similar to classical entailment, this naturally suggests the order of P and Q for the definitions of partial entailments. Also, the switched-\u2200\u2200 (switched-\u2203\u2203) style definition is the same as the \u2200\u2200 (\u2203\u2203) style definition. As shown in Example 4, they are not suitable for defining the notions of partial entailments. To understand why the switched-\u2200\u2203 style and the switched-\u2203\u2200 style definitions fail for capturing partial entailments, let us consider the following example.\nExample 5 Consider two formulas x \u2194 y and x. The former has two prime implicants, namely {x, y} and {\u00acx,\u00acy}, while the latter has a unique prime implicant, namely {x}. If we take the switched-\u2200\u2203 style definition, we have x \u2194 y (weakly, strongly) partially entails x. However, this is not intuitive because {\u00acx,\u00acy} achieves x \u2194 y but it also achieves \u00acx. Hence, there exists a case that x\u2194 y is true but x is false.\nAgain, consider the formula x \u2228 y. It has two prime implicants, namely {x} and {y}. Intuitively, this formula should (weakly, strongly) partially entail itself. However, this is not the case if we apply the switched-\u2203\u2200 style definition. 2\nOne of the fundamental properties is the relationships among three notions of partial entailments. The following proposition shows that weak partial entailment is weaker than partial entailment, which is further weaker than strong partial entailment. However, by observations from Example 1, the converses do not hold in general.\nProposition 6 (Basic relationships among partial entailments) Let P , Q be two formulas and \u0393 a formula set. If P S\u0393 Q, then P \u0393 Q; if P \u0393 Q, then P W\u0393 Q.\nIt is worth mentioning that, in the definitions of partial entailments, PI(\u0393, P ) is required not to be empty to exclude the case when P is inconsistent with the background theory \u0393. The underlying intuition is that partial entailments require \u201creal\u201d connections between the two formulas w.r.t. the background theory. Let us take a closer look at item 2 in the definitions. The basic idea of partial entailments is that for each prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393, there exists a prime implicant of Q w.r.t. \u0393 such that the two literal sets satisfy that, for instance, their intersection are not empty. In other words, P partially entails Q w.r.t. \u0393 via these two literal sets. However, item 2 does not exclude the case where there is no prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393. In this case, item 2 still holds. However, we cannot say that P partially entails Q w.r.t. \u0393 \u201cvia the two literal sets\u201d now because the two literals sets do\nnot exist at all. Hence, we require an additional item 1 to make sure that PI(\u0393, P ) is not empty.\nThen, for any formulas P inconsistent with \u0393, P does not (weakly, strongly) partially entail any formula Q. Also, for any formulas P entailed by \u0393, P does not (weakly, strongly) partially entail any formula Q. However, the reasons of these two cases are different. For the former, the reason is that PI(\u0393, P ) is empty (see Proposition 4), thus P is excluded by item 1 in the definitions. For the latter, the reason is that PI(\u0393, P ) = {\u2205} (see Proposition 4 again), thus the prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393 has no intersections with other prime implicants. We say that a formula P is trivial with respect to a background formula set \u0393 if \u0393 |= P or \u0393 |= \u00acP . Otherwise, we say that P is nontrivial with respect to \u0393. The following proposition shows that a trivial formula can neither (weakly, strongly) partially entail any formula, nor they can be (weakly, strongly) partially entailed by any formulas.\nProposition 7 (Non-Triviality) Let \u0393 be a formula set and P and Q two formulas. If P is trivial w.r.t. \u0393, then P 6 \u0393 Q and Q 6 \u0393 P . This assertion holds for weak partial entailment and strong partial entailment as well.\nProposition 8 (Extension of Classical Entailment) Let \u0393 be a formula set and P and Q two formulas nontrivial w.r.t. \u0393. If \u0393 |= P \u2192 Q, then P \u0393 Q. Also, P W\u0393 Q.\nProposition 8 shows that partial entailment is an extension of classical entailment if only considering nontrivial formulas, so is weak partial entailment. The converses do not hold. As a simple example, x (weakly) partially entails x\u2227y but x does not classically entail x\u2227y.\nNote that strong partial entailment and classical entailment are mutually different. For example, x\u2227y classically entails x but x\u2227y does not strongly partially entail x. Conversely, x strongly partially entails x\u2227y but x does not classically entail x\u2227y. As we demonstrated in Section 2.1, the reason is that strong partial entailment prohibits irrelevancy whilst classical entailment does not.\nIn addition, strong partial entailment captures the notion of \u201cpart\u201d in a broader sense. In other words, if a formula P strongly partially entails a formula Q with respect to a background formula set \u0393, then P can be considered as a \u201cpart\u201d of Q w.r.t. \u0393. In this sense, it also explains why classical entailment does not necessarily imply strong partial entailment. However, this explanation seems to suggest the other way around. That is, if P strongly partially entails Q w.r.t. \u0393 (i.e., P is a part of Q w.r.t. \u0393), then Q classically entails P w.r.t. \u0393. In fact, this is not the case either. For example, x strongly partially entails (x\u2227 y)\u2228 (y \u2227 z), but (x\u2227 y)\u2228 (y \u2227 z) does not classically entails x. The reason here is that a formula may contain disjunctive information. If restricted into the simple case discussed in Section 2.1, this is indeed the case. That is, given two consistent literal sets \u03c0 and \u03c0\u2032, \u03c0 strongly partially entails \u03c0\u2032 if and only if \u03c0\u2032 classically entails \u03c0."}, {"heading": "2.4 More Semantic Properties", "text": "In this subsection, we extensively study some semantic properties in relation to all three kinds of partial entailments. The reasons why we are interested in these properties are twofold. Firstly, they provide deeper understandings of how partial entailments work. As we will see later, surprisingly, many simple inference rules fail for partial entailments. Secondly, these properties illustrate some similarities/differences among three kinds of partial\nentailments, as well as the similarities/differences between partial entailments and classical entailment.\nWe consider a collection of inference rules. Some of them are considered to be important in many kinds of philosophical logics and knowledge representation logics, others are likely to hold for partial entailments. Let \u0393 and \u0393\u2032 be two sets of formulas, P , Q and R formulas and x and y atoms. In this subsection, we assume that all formulas are nontrivial w.r.t. the background theory.1 Here, we use >\u0393 to denote any kinds of partial entailments with respect to \u0393. The inferences rules we considered are listed as follows:\nRef: (Reflexivity) P >\u0393 P , meaning that a formula partially entails itself w.r.t. any background theory.\nLE: (Left Equivalence) If \u0393 |= P \u2194 R and P >\u0393 Q, then R >\u0393 Q, meaning that if two formulas are equivalent under the background theory, then they play the same role in partial entailments on the left side.\nRE: (Right Equivalence) If \u0393 |= Q \u2194 R and P >\u0393 Q, then P >\u0393 R, meaning that if two formulas are equivalent under the background theory, then they play the same role in partial entailments on the right side.\nBE: (Background theory Equivalence) If \u0393 |= \u0393\u2032 and \u0393\u2032 |= \u0393, then P >\u0393 Q iff P >\u0393\u2032 Q, meaning that if two background theories are equivalent, then they play the same role in partial entailments.\nRev: (Relevancy) If P > Q, then Atom(P ) \u2229 Atom(Q) 6= \u2205, meaning that if one formula partially entails another w.r.t. the empty background theory, then the atom sets used in the two formulas respectively must not be disjoint.\nTran: (Transitivity) If P >\u0393 Q and Q >\u0393 R, then P >\u0393 R, meaning that partial entailment relation among formulas is an ordering on the propositional language.\nAS: (Atom Substitution) If P >\u0393 Q, then P (x/y) >\u0393 Q(x/y),2 meaning that any atoms in a partial entailment relation can be replaced by other atoms.\nLO: (Left Or) If P >\u0393 Q and R >\u0393 Q, then P \u2228R >\u0393 Q, meaning that if both two formulas partially entail another one, then their disjunction should partially entails the formula as well.\nLS: (Left Strengthening) If \u0393 |= P \u2192 R and R >\u0393 Q, then P >\u0393 Q, meaning that if a formula partially entails another, then a formula strengthened by the former should partially entail the latter as well.\nRA: (Right And) If P >\u0393 Q and P >\u0393 R, then P >\u0393 R \u2227 Q, meaning that if two formulas are both partially entailed by another formula, then their conjunction should be partially entailed by the formula as well.\n1. This is because trivial formulas are not interesting for partial entailments (see Proposition 7). 2. Here, P (x/y) is the formula obtained from P by simultaneously replacing every occurrence of atom x by\ny, similar for Q(x/y).\nRO: (Right Or) If P >\u0393 Q, then P >\u0393 Q \u2228 R, meaning that if a formula partially entails another, then it should partially entail the disjunction of the latter formula with any formulas.\nMono: (Monotonicity) If \u0393\u2032 |= \u0393 and P >\u0393 Q, then P >\u0393\u2032 Q, meaning that adding more information into the background theory preserves partial entailment relations.\nLN: (Left Negation) If P >\u0393 Q, then \u00acP 6>\u0393 Q, meaning that it is impossible that both a formula and its negation partially entail another formula.\nRN: (Right Negation) If P >\u0393 Q, then P 6>\u0393 \u00acQ, meaning that it is impossible that both a formula and its negation can be partially entailed by another formula.\nSuppose that we define the relation >\u0393 between P and Q as classical entailment, i.e., \u0393 |= P \u2192 Q. Then, it satisfies all the inference rules proposed above. However, the following proposition shows that partial entailments fail for many of them.\nProposition 9 Table 2 summarizes whether all three kinds of partial entailments satisfy the inference rules considered above.\nTable 2 illustrates some similarities and differences among all three kinds of partial entailments. They have the same results for most of these inference rules. However, Transitivity (Tran) and Left Strengthening (LS) (highlighted by the \u2217 symbol in Table 2) are two exceptions. Transitivity (Tran) holds for strong partial entailment but not for partial entailment and weak partial entailment. Left Strengthening (LS) holds for weak partial entailment but not for partial entailment and strong partial entailment. Finally, both weak\npartial entailment and partial entailment are extensions of classical entailment in the sense considered in Proposition 8, while strong partial entailment is not.\nAlso, Table 2 illustrates some similarities and differences between partial entailments and classical entailment. As we mentioned above, all these inference rules hold for classical entailment. However, this is not the case for partial entailments. This means that partial entailments actually behave quite different from classical entailment. Among these inference rules, Transitivity is an important one. It does not hold for partial entailment and weak partial entailment since they allow irrelevancies. Nevertheless, Transitivity holds for strong partial entailment. However, strong partial entailment is even more dissimilar to classical entailment since they are mutually different.\nTable 2 also indicates that it is not easy to capture the properties of the notions of partial entailments due to the fact that they fail most of the simple inference rules (see Table 2). Meanwhile, some properties, (e.g. Tran, LN and RN), may seem to be intuitive for partial entailments. However, it turns out that they do not hold in general according to the formal definitions.\nCertainly, one can consider other inference rules, for instance, Contraposition. That is, if P >\u0393 Q, then \u00acQ \u0393 \u00acP . One can check that Contraposition does not hold for all three kinds of partial entailments either."}, {"heading": "2.5 Discussions", "text": "One may doubt whether partial entailments can be directly captured within classical propositional logic. For example, one may define partial entailment as follows. A formula P partially entails a formula Q w.r.t. a formula set \u0393 iff there exists a formula R such that \u0393\u222a {R} 6|= Q but \u0393\u222a {P,R} |= Q. However, this definition cannot capture partial satisfaction. In fact, for every formula P such that \u0393 6|= P \u2192 Q, there always exists such a formula R (Let R be \u00ac \u2227 \u0393\u2228\u00acP \u2228Q). Even if we restrict R with consistent literal sets, this definition does not capture partial satisfaction either. For instance, x\u2228\u00acy should partially entail x\u2227y according to this definition since (x\u2228\u00acy)\u2227 y |= x\u2227 y. However, this conclusion is counterintuitive. As an alternative possibility, since \u201cP partially entails Q\u201d intuitively means that P entails some parts of Q, one may define partial entailment as: a formula P partially entails a formula Q iff there exists Q\u2032 and Q\u2032\u2032 such that |= Q \u2194 Q\u2032 \u2227 Q\u2032\u2032, Q\u2032\u2032 6|= Q\u2032 and P |= Q\u2032. However, this definition fails to capture the essence of partial entailment either. For instance, according to this definition, x partially entails y since |= y \u2194 (x\u2228y)\u2227(\u00acx\u2228y), \u00acx \u2228 y 6|= x \u2228 y, and x |= x \u2228 y.\nAccording to the definitions of partial entailments, x (weakly, strongly) partially entails both x \u2227 y and x \u2228 y. One may conclude that this result indicates that conjunction and disjunction play a similar role in partial entailments. However, this is not the case. In this example, the reasons why x partially entails x \u2227 y and why x partially entails x \u2228 y are completely different. In the former case, the reason is that x is a part of x\u2227 y, while in the latter case, the reason is that x classically entails x\u2228y. In fact, conjunction and disjunction play totally different roles in partial entailments. For instance, x \u2227 y partially entails x, while x \u2228 y does not. More examples can be easily found.\nAnother evidence to illustrate the differences between conjunction and disjunction is to consider another special case of partial entailments by restricting the formulas to clauses, i.e., disjunction of literals, and assuming the background theory to be empty.\nProposition 10 Let \u03b4 and \u03b4\u2032 be two non-valid clauses (i.e., disjunctions of two consistent sets of literals). The following statements are equivalent.\n1. \u03b4 is a subset of \u03b4\u2032 if they are represented as two sets of literals.\n2. \u03b4 classically entails \u03b4\u2032.\n3. \u03b4 weakly partially entails \u03b4\u2032.\n4. \u03b4 partially entails \u03b4\u2032.\n5. \u03b4 strongly partially entails \u03b4\u2032.\nProposition 10 states that under this setting, classical entailment and all three kinds of partial entailments coincide. Compared Proposition 10 to Definition 1, disjunction and conjunction are quite different in partial entailments.\nAs we mentioned earlier, the Substitution principle does not hold for all three kinds of partial entailments in general. This means that, in partial entailments, the atoms indeed play a different role with formulas. For instance, x (weakly, strongly) partially entails x\u2227y. However, it is not necessary the case that P partially entails P \u2227Q. This shows a difference between partial entailments and classical entailment due to the fact that the Substitution principle holds for standard propositional logic."}, {"heading": "3. Complexity Analysis", "text": "In this section, we analyze the complexity issues in relation to the extended notion of prime implicant and all three kinds of partial entailments. We assume that readers are familiar with some basic notions of computational complexity. More details can be found in the textbook by Papadimitriou (1994).\nHere, we briefly recall some complexity classes. DP is a widely used complexity class, which contains all languages L such that L = L1\u2229L2, where L1 is in NP and L2 is in coNP. The polynomial hierarchy is defined recursively as follows:\n\u2206P0 := \u03a3 P 0 := \u03a0 P 0 := P, \u2206Pi+1 := P \u03a3Pi , i \u2265 0, \u03a3Pi+1 := NP \u03a3Pi , i \u2265 0, \u03a0Pi+1 := coNP \u03a3Pi , i \u2265 0.\nFor instance, \u2206P3 = P \u03a3P2 is the complexity class of all languages that are recognizable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing Machine equipped with a \u03a3P2 oracle. In particular, \u2206P3 [O(log n)] is a subset of the \u2206 P 3 by restricting the uses of the oracle within logarithmical times. Gottlob (1995) showed that the complexity classes \u2206P3 and \u2206 P 3 [O(log n)]\ncoincide with so-called \u03a3P2 -dag and \u03a3 P 2 -tree respectively. Intuitively, a \u03a3 P 2 -dag is an acyclic directed graph of dependent queries to \u03a3P2 oracles. The nodes are queries whilst the edges represent the dependency relationships among nodes. A \u03a3P2 -tree is a \u03a3 P 2 -dag that is a tree.\nWe mainly investigate the following decision problems, both in the most general case and in some restricted cases:\nPRIC(\u0393, P, \u03c0) : (Prime Implicant Checking) to determine whether a literal set \u03c0 is a prime implicant of a formula P w.r.t. a formula set \u0393.\nLEPR(\u0393, P, l) : (Literal Existence in Prime Implicants) to determine whether a literal l is in at least one prime implicant of a formula P w.r.t. a formula set \u0393.\nLAPR(\u0393, P, l) : (Literal in All Prime Implicants) to determine whether a literal l is in all prime implicants of a formula P w.r.t. a formula set \u0393.\nWPE(\u0393, P, Q) : (Weak Partial Entailment) to determine whether P weakly partially entails Q w.r.t. \u0393.\nPE(\u0393, P, Q) : (Partial Entailment) to determine whether P partially entails Q w.r.t. \u0393.\nSPE(\u0393, P, Q) : (Strong Partial Entailment) to determine whether P strongly partially entails Q w.r.t. \u0393.\nFor convenience, we omit \u0393 when it is empty. The first three decision problems are concerned with the relativized notion of prime implicant, while the others are concerned with the notions of partial entailments. The main focuses in this paper are of course the latter ones, while the former ones are needed as the intermediate steps.\nNote that some of the complexity results related to prime implicant can be found in or followed by existing results in the literature (see more details in Appendix). For instance, as shown by Marquis (2000) (Propositions 3.27 and 3.32), checking whether a literal set (with or without background theory) is a prime implicate of a formula is DP complete. Another result comes from Proposition 10 by Lang et al. (2003) that checking whether a literal is in at least one prime implicant of a formula is NP complete. Also, as a consequence of the correspondence between prime implicant and abduction, many complexity results related to abduction can be borrowed for studying prime implicant. For instance, as shown in the Appendix, checking whether a literal l is in one of the prime implicants of F with respect to \u0393 is exactly the task of relevance checking in abduction.\nHowever, as the main focus of this paper, partial entailments are defined upon prime implicant (i.e. abduction). Although existing results conclude some of the computational complexity results related to prime implicant, they do not reveal too much information about the complexities of partial entailments."}, {"heading": "3.1 Empty Background Theory", "text": "We start our complexity analysis when the background formula set \u0393 is empty. The following proposition shows the complexity results in relation to prime implicant when the background theory is empty. As mentioned above, the first two results follow by existing results in the literature.\nProposition 11 The computational complexities in relation to prime implicant with empty background theory are summarized in Table 3.\nBased on the computational analysis on prime implicant, the following proposition presents a complete result for the complexity results in relation to all three kinds of partial entailments when the background theory is empty.3\nProposition 12 The computational complexities in relation to partial entailments with empty background theory are summarized in Table 4. Here, l is a literal, \u03c0 is a set of literals and P and Q are formulas.\nLet us take a closer look at Table 4. First of all, it shows that it is not an easy task to compute the notions of partial entailments, even when the background theory is empty. For instance, to check whether a formula (weakly) partially entails another formula is at the second level of polynomial hierarchy. More surprisingly, this task for strong partial entailment is even more difficult, which is at the third level of polynomial hierarchy.\nAlso, from Table 4, one can conclude that the computational complexities increase when the forms of formulas become more complicated. For instance, checking whether a literal strongly partially entails a formula is NP complete. When extending the literal to a literal set, this becomes \u03a3P2 complete. The task further turns into \u03a0 P 3 complete when extending the antecedent to an arbitrary formula. Interestingly, for weak partial entailment and partial entailment, no matter considering partially entailing a formula or partially entailed by a formula, turning a literal to a literal set does not increase the complexity. However, for\n3. Clearly, if both the antecedent and the consequent are restricted to literal sets, then the corresponding decision problems in relation to all three kinds of partial entailments can be solved in linear time.\nstrong partial entailment, this is the case for partially entailed by a formula but not for partially entailing a formula.\nFinally, it can be observed that, when the background theory is empty, weak partial entailment and partial entailment have the same computational complexities, while strong partial entailment acts differently. Interestingly, based on some basic assumptions in the complexity theory, checking strong partial entailment relationship is sometimes easier than the rest two (e.g. compare SPE(P, \u03c0) and PE(P, \u03c0)), but sometimes more difficult (e.g. compare SPE(P, Q) and PE(P, Q)).\nIn some application scenarios, the background theory is simply a set of facts, which can be represented as a set of literals. Hence, we are interested in the computational complexities for this special case. As we shall see later, this is much simpler than the general case when the background theory is an arbitrary set of formulas.\nThe following proposition indicates that, fortunately, turning the background formula set into a literal set does not increase the computational complexities for all three kinds of partial entailments.\nProposition 13 All the complexity results in Tables 3 and 4 remain the same if the background theory is a set of literals."}, {"heading": "3.2 General Background Theory", "text": "Finally, we face to the general case, in which the background theory is an arbitrary formula set.

Here, we also present the corresponding computational complexity results when the background theory is empty in order to compare them directly.\ncomplexities increase for the other decision problems. For instance, checking whether a literal is in one (or all) prime implicant(s) of a formula increases from NP complete (DP complete, resp.) to \u03a3P2 complete (\u03a0 P 2 complete, resp.) when the background theory turns into an arbitrary one. Also, the complexities of checking weak partial entailment and partial entailment in general case increase a little because these two problems are both \u03a3P2 and \u03a0P2 hard. However, the corresponding complexity for strong partial entailment remains the same since it is already \u03a0P3 hard in the special case when the background theory is empty.\nAs shown in Table 5, WPE(\u0393, P, Q) and PE(\u0393, P, Q) are both \u03a0P2 hard and \u03a3 P 2 hard. This shows that they are neither \u03a0P2 complete nor \u03a3 P 2 complete based on some basic assumptions in the complexity theory. We conjecture that WPE(\u0393, P, Q) is \u2206P3 [O(log n)] complete and PE(\u0393, P, Q) is \u03a0P3 complete.

Moreover, k-satisfaction is only concerned with a particular (CNF) formula, while partial entailments are concerned with the relationship between two formulas (w.r.t. a background theory)."}, {"heading": "5. Partial Goal Satisfaction", "text": "In traditional logic based approach of rational agency, the agents always try to find actions to \u201ccompletely\u201d achieve their goals. If not successful, the agents would choose to wait and do nothing. This idea is usually formalized by using classical entailment. However, it is not always the case that the agents can find out such a perfect action (think about the real world that we live in). Under the situation, it is sometimes useful for the agents to do something \u201ctowards\u201d their goals rather than just waiting, in which those actions \u201cpartially\u201d satisfying the agents\u2019 goal should be rational candidates. Here, partial entailments may serve as a logic foundation.\nExample 6 Let us consider an example. Suppose that Laura wants to have milk and cereal as her breakfast. However, there are only three choices available on the breakfast menu.\nChoice1 Only milk is offered.\nChoice2 Milk and bread are offered.\nChoice3 Only bread is offered.\nDue to the current information, none of these choices completely satisfies Laura\u2019s goal. Then, what should she do? 2\nHere, we argue that, under this circumstance, it is also rational for the agents to choose those actions partially achieving their goal according to their belief, as there is no action completely achieving the goal.\nIt is important to allow those actions partially achieving the agents\u2019 goal to be rational candidates. First of all, the rationality of performing those actions is solid since they make the goal closer for the agents and there is nothing better to do. Hence, choosing those actions useful to the agents\u2019 goal is more reasonable than just waiting. Also, the environment is dynamic in nature. In some cases, if the agents do not choose those actions partially achieving their goal, it might lose the chance to achieve the goal forever. This frequently happens in everyday life when we cannot seize the opportunities.\nWe formalize partial achievement between actions and goals under the agents\u2019 belief by using the notion of partial entailments proposed in Section 2. This is natural since partial entailments precisely capture the partial satisfaction relations between two formulas with respect to a background theory. To apply partial entailments to formalize partial goal satisfaction, we treat the background theory as the agents\u2019 belief, the consequent as the agents\u2019 goal and the antecedent as the consequences of the action. One obstacle is how to\nrepresent actions and their consequences. Here, to address this issue, we simply use triples in Hoare logic to represent actions.5\nAgain, we restrict our discussions within a propositional language. The goal and the belief of agents are represented as a propositional formula and a set of propositional formulas respectively. An action \u03b1 is a triple \u3008Pre(\u03b1), \u03b1, Post(\u03b1)\u3009, where \u03b1 is a label called the body of the action, and Pre(\u03b1) and Post(\u03b1) are two propositional formulas called the precondition and postcondition of the action respectively. Next, we show how the traditional idea of complete goal satisfaction and our idea of partial goal satisfaction can be formalized under this setting.\nDefinition 13 (Complete goal satisfaction) Let \u0393 be an agent\u2019s belief and G the agent\u2019s goal. Let A be a set of candidate actions. An action \u03b1 \u2208 A completely achieves the agent\u2019s goal G according to its belief \u0393 iff:\n1. \u0393 |= Pre(\u03b1).\n2. \u0393 \u222a {Post(\u03b1)} is consistent.\n3. \u0393 |= Post(\u03b1)\u2192 G.\nDefinition 13 means that if the agent\u2019s belief satisfies the precondition of an action and it believes that the postcondition of the action entails its goal, then this action completely achieves its goal under the belief. Partial goal satisfaction is formalized in a similar way except that partial entailments are used instead of classical entailment.\nDefinition 14 (Partial goal satisfaction) Let \u0393 be an agent\u2019s belief and G the agent\u2019s goal. Let A be a set of candidate actions. An action \u03b1 \u2208 A (weakly, strongly) partially achieves the agent\u2019s goal G according to its belief \u0393 iff:\n1. \u0393 |= Pre(\u03b1).\n2. Post(\u03b1)( W\u0393 , S\u0393) \u0393 G.\nDefinition 14 means that if the agent\u2019s belief satisfies the precondition of an action and it believes that the postcondition of the action partially entails its goal, then this action partially achieves its goal under the belief.\nExample 7 Consider Example 6 proposed previously. To formalize this example, we use x, y and z to represent \u201chaving milk\u201d, \u201chaving cereal\u201d and \u201chaving bread\u201d respectively. Then, Laura\u2019s belief is empty since there is no background knowledge; her goal can be represented as x \u2227 y; the preconditions of the three actions to take the three choices respectively are empty as well and can be represented as >, while the postcondition of the three cases can be represented as x, x \u2227 z and z respectively. According to Definition 13, none of the three actions completely achieves the goal x \u2227 y. However, according to Definition 14, to take Choice1 and Choice2 (weakly) partially achieve the goal. In particular, to take Choice1 strongly partially achieves the goal, whilst to take Choice3 does not partially achieve the goal in any sense. 2\n5. Here, we only use a simple action theory to demonstrate how the notion of partial entailments can be used for formalizing partial goal satisfaction. The problems of how to represent actions for agents in general and how to deal with the frame problem is out of the scope of this paper.\nA problem arises which kind of partial goal satisfaction is rational for the agents. At first glance, it seems that partial entailment is more appropriate for this purpose. Weak partial entailment may contain side effects that are not acceptable, whilst strong partial entailment are too strict that some powerful actions are excluded. However, we believe it is better to leave this to the agent designers. One may choose different kinds of partial goal satisfaction in different application domains, e.g., strong partial entailment if both irrelevancies and side effects are crucial issues, or partial entailment if side effects are unacceptable but irrelevancies are not, or weak partial entailment in looser cases.\nIt is worth mentioning that partial goal satisfaction only proposes one possible solution for dealing with the situations that the agents cannot find a plan to completely achieve their goal. It is neither the only solution nor necessarily perfectly rational. In some such situations, the actions achieving some parts of the agents\u2019 goal may lose its chances to achieve other parts, which might be unacceptable for the agents.\nAlso, the actions partially achieving the agents\u2019 goal are only rational candidates but not compulsory. It is quite different between the fact that an action is a rational candidate and that the agents really choose to perform it. Partial goal satisfaction only explains the rationality of those actions partially achieving the goals. The problem of which particular action should be chosen to perform among all the actions partially achieving the agents\u2019 goal is another research topic and is beyond the scope of this paper.\nAnother approach for handling these situations is to explicitly represent the agents\u2019 full preferences among all combinations of goals. For instance, in Example 6, Laura may have the following full preferences among all candidate goals:\n{Milk, Cereal} > {Milk} > {Cereal} > {},\nwhere > represents the preference relation. If Laura\u2019s original goal (i.e. Milk \u2227 Cereal) cannot be achieved, then she intends to achieve the second best candidate goal (i.e. Milk) according to her preference. It can be observed that partial goal satisfaction is not always consistent with the full preference approach, for instance, if the above preference of Laura turns into {Milk, Cereal} > {} > {Milk} > {Cereal}. Although sharing some similarities, these two approaches are essentially different. First of all, full preference requires additional information, while partial goal satisfaction does not. Moreover, it is expensive to represent the full preference of agents. Since the number of possible combinations of goals are exponential with respect to the size of goals, to represent a full preference requires double exponential number of new information. Last but not least, it is usually difficult to obtain the full preferences of agents. Hence, we believe that both the full preference approach and the partial goal satisfaction approach have their own advantages and disadvantages for dealing with the situations when there is no perfect actions to achieve the agents\u2019 goal.\nThe idea of partial satisfaction of goals has been discussed elsewhere in the AI literature (Haddawy & Hanks, 1992; Smith, 2004; Do, Benton, van den Briel, & Kambhampati, 2007). One approach is so called partial satisfaction planning (Smith, 2004; Do et al., 2007). In partial satisfaction planning, agents find plans, instead of completely achieving their goals, that partially achieve their goals. Since the agents\u2019 goals in AI planning, particularly in STRIPS-like planning, are usually represented as conjunctions of small pieces of subgoals, it can be formalized as finding plans that achieve subsets of those subgoals. In fact, this is a special case of partial entailments in the sense that partial entailment is dealing with\narbitrary propositional formulas. Another approach is due to Haddawy and Hanks (1992). In their approach, the agents\u2019 goals are represented as groups of candidate goals and each of them is associated with a real number between [0, 1] to represent the degree of chances of satisfying a goal. A plan satisfying a candidate goal with number 1 is full satisfaction while a plan satisfying a candidate goal with a number between (0, 1) (e.g., 0.5) is partial satisfaction. There are several differences between this approach and partial entailments. Firstly, in partial entailments, the objective formula is represented by a single formula instead of a set of candidate variations. Secondly, numerical degree of satisfaction is not introduced in partial entailments. Finally, in partial entailments, the partial satisfaction relationships come from the internal structures of formulas.\nFinally, we would like to mention that the application scenario discussed here for partial entailments is reasoning about rational agents but not classical AI planning, e.g. STRIPS. The main reason is that the agents\u2019 goal and beliefs are formalized by literal sets rather than arbitrary formulas in STRIPS planning, but the main focus of this paper is to introduce the notions of partial entailments to propositional logic in general. Nevertheless, since checking partial entailments when restricted the antecedent, the consequent and the background theory all to be literal sets can be done in linear time, it is interesting to apply partial entailments in AI planning. We would like to leave this as our future investigations."}, {"heading": "6. Concluding Remarks", "text": "In this paper, we introduced a new logical notion\u2013partial entailment\u2013to propositional logic. We distinguished three different kinds of partial entailments (See Table 1) based on the notion of prime implicant. From the weakest to strongest, they are weak partial entailment, partial entailment and strong partial entailment respectively. We then investigated the semantic properties of partial entailments (See Table 2). The results demonstrate that the properties of partial entailments are difficult to be captured since many simple inference rules do not hold. We also investigated the computational complexity of partial entailments (See Tables 4 and 5). The complexity results are surprising and interesting. For instance, checking strong partial entailment is \u03a0P3 complete, even when the background theory is empty. This indicates that although the definitions of partial entailments look simple, it is not easy to compute them.\nWe showed that the notions of partial entailments can serve as a foundation of formalizing partial goal satisfaction in reasoning about rational agents. Another potential application scenario, mentioned in our previous work (Zhou, van der Torre, & Zhang, 2008), is goal weakening by using strong partial entailment. When an agent needs to modify its goal, it can choose a weakened one that strongly partially entails the original goal with respect to the agent\u2019s belief. This is because strong partial entailment preserves some of the important parts of the original goal. However, more sophisticated work are needed to develop such a goal weakening framework. Also, as mentioned previously, it is interesting to apply partial entailments in AI planning, where all formulas are syntactically restricted so that the computation task of partial entailment may become easier.\nAnother direction of future work lies in computing partial entailments. Of course, an important task is to develop an algorithm directly for this purpose. However, an alternative\napproach is to identify some tractable subclasses for checking partial entailments since the general complexities are relatively high."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Some preliminary results of this paper were published (Zhou & Chen, 2004; Zhou et al., 2008).

Selected Proofs6\nProposition 8 (Extension of Classical Entailment) Let \u0393 be a formula set and P and Q two formulas nontrivial w.r.t. \u0393. If \u0393 |= P \u2192 Q, then P \u0393 Q. Also, P W\u0393 Q.\nProof: We first prove that P \u0393 Q. Let \u03c0 be a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393. We have that \u0393 \u222a \u03c0 |= P . Since \u0393 |= P \u2192 Q, we have that \u0393 \u222a \u03c0 |= Q. By Proposition 2, there is a subset \u03c0\u2032 of \u03c0 such that \u03c0\u2032 is a prime implicant of Q w.r.t. \u0393. Thus \u03c0\u2032 \u2286 \u03c0. Due to non-triviality of P and Q, \u03c0 \u2229 \u03c0\u2032 6= \u2205 and \u03c0 \u2229 \u2212\u03c0\u2032 = \u2205. This shows that P \u0393 Q.\nAccording to Proposition 6, P W\u0393 Q. 2\nProposition 9 Table 2 summarizes whether all three kinds of partial entailments satisfy the inference rules considered above.\nProof: Here, we only give the proofs or counterexamples of some of the results. For Relevancy, according to Definition 5, there exists \u03c0 \u2208 PI(P ) and \u03c0\u2032 \u2208 PI(Q) such that \u03c0\u2229\u03c0\u2032 6= \u2205. Therefore, Atom(\u03c0)\u2229Atom(\u03c0\u2032) 6= \u2205. It follows that Atom(P )\u2229Atom(Q) 6= \u2205 since Atom(\u03c0) \u2286 Atom(P ) and Atom(\u03c0\u2032) \u2286 Atom(Q). Similar for weak partial entailment and strong partial entailment.\nFor Transitivity of strong partial entailment, let \u03c0 be a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393. Since P S\u0393 Q, there exists a literal set \u03c01 consistent with \u0393 such that \u03c01 \u2208 PI(\u0393, Q) and \u03c0 \u2286 \u03c01. Moreover, since Q S\u0393 R, there exists a literal set \u03c02 consistent with \u0393 such that \u03c02 \u2208 PI(\u0393, R) and \u03c01 \u2286 \u03c02. Hence, \u03c0 \u2286 \u03c02. This shows that P S\u0393 R.\nNote that Transitivity does not hold for either partial entailment or weak partial entailment. For instance, x x \u2227 y and x \u2227 y y, but x 6 y. Similarly, x W x \u2227 y and x \u2227 y W y, but x 6 W y. The reason why partial entailment and weak partial entailment fail transitivity is that they allow irrelevancies. In the above example, although x \u2227 y partially entails y, it contains x, which is irrelevant to y, and it is exactly the reason why x partially entails x \u2227 y.\n6. We only present some of the proofs here. The others are relatively simple, and can be found in our full version, available at http://www.scm.uws.edu.au/~yzhou/papers/partial-entailment-full-version.pdf .\nFor Left Strengthening of weak partial entailment, let \u03c0 be a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393. Then, \u0393 \u222a \u03c0 |= P . It follows that \u0393 \u222a \u03c0 |= R since \u0393 |= P \u2192 R. By Proposition 2, there is a subset \u03c01 of \u03c0, which is a prime implicant of R w.r.t. \u0393. Moreover, R W\u0393 Q. Then, there exists a prime implicant \u03c02 of Q w.r.t. \u0393 such that \u03c01 \u2229 \u03c02 6= \u2205. Thus, \u03c0 \u2229 \u03c02 6= \u2205. This shows that P W\u0393 Q.\nNote that Left Strengthening does not hold for either partial entailment or strong partial entailment. For example, we have that x S x \u2227 y and x x \u2227 y, but x \u2227 \u00acy 6 S x \u2227 y and x \u2227 \u00acy 6 x \u2227 y. The reason why strong partial entailment and partial entailment fail Left Strengthening is that they prohibit side effects since the strengthening part on the left side could be side effect to the right side, e.g., \u00acy in the above example.\nBoth Left Negation and Right Negation do not hold for all three kinds of partial entailments. As an example, both x and \u00acx (weakly, strongly) partially entail x\u2194 y. Meanwhile, x (weakly, strongly) partially entails both x\u2194 y and \u00ac(x\u2194 y). 2\nProposition 11 The computational complexities in relation to prime implicant are summarized in Table 3.\nProof: The first result can be proved similarly to Proposition 3.27 in the work of Marquis (2000), and the second one follows directly from Proposition 10 in the work of Lang et al. (2003). For the last result, it is easy to prove that l occurs in all prime implicants of P iff P can be satisfied and |= P \u2192 l. It immediately proves the membership of this assertion. Hardness follows from the fact that P is satisfiable and Q is unsatisfiable iff x is in all prime implicants of (x \u2227 P ) \u2228 (\u00acx \u2227Q), where x is a new atom. 2\nProposition 12 The computational complexities in relation to partial entailments with empty background theory are summarized in Table 4. Here, l is a literal, \u03a0 is a set of literals and P and Q are formulas.\nProof: For the membership of WPE(\u03c0, P), let \u03c0 = {l1, ..., lk}. Then \u03c0 weakly partially entails P if and only if there exists li, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k such that li is in one of the prime implicant of P . By Proposition 11, this problem is in NP.\nFor the membership of PE(\u03c0, P), we first prove that a literal set \u03c0 partially entails a formula P iff there is an assignment \u03c01 over Atom\\Atom(\u03c0) and an assignment \u03c02 over Atom(\u03c0) such that \u03c0 \u222a \u03c01 |= P and \u03c01 \u222a \u03c02 |= \u00acP . \u201c\u21d2:\u201d By Definition 5, there is a prime implicant \u03c0\u2032 of P such that \u03c0 \u2229 \u03c0\u2032 6= \u2205 and \u03c0 \u2229 \u2212\u03c0\u2032 = \u2205. Let l \u2208 \u03c0\u2032 \u2229 \u03c0. Then \u03c0\u2032\\{l} \u222a {\u2212l} 6|= P . It can be extended to an assignment \u03c00 over Atom, which satisfies \u00acP . Let \u03c01 \u2286 \u03c00 and Atom(\u03c01) = Atom\\Atom(\u03c0); let \u03c02 \u2286 \u03c00 and Atom(\u03c02) = Atom(\u03c0). Clearly, \u03c0 \u222a \u03c01 |= P and \u03c01 \u222a \u03c02 |= \u00acP . \u201c\u21d0:\u201d By Proposition 2, there is a prime implicant \u03c0\u2032 of P such that \u03c0\u2032 \u2286 \u03c0 \u222a \u03c01. It follows that \u03c0\u2032 \u2229 \u03c0 6= \u2205 and \u03c0\u2032 \u2229 \u2212\u03c0 = \u2205. Hence, \u03c0 partially entails P . Hence, the following algorithm determines whether \u03c0 partially entails P : 1. simultaneously guess two literal sets \u03c01 and \u03c02; 2. check whether \u03c01 and \u03c02 together with \u03c0 satisfy the above conditions. Step 2 can be done in polynomial time. Therefore, PE(\u03c0, P) in NP.\nFor SPE(\u03c0, P), membership is easily shown by the following algorithm: 1. guess a consistent literal set \u03c0\u2032; 2. check whether \u03c0\u2032 is a prime implicant of P ; 3. if yes, check whether \u03c0 is a subset of \u03c0\u2032. By Proposition 11, step 2 requires an NP oracle. Hence, this problem is in \u03a3P2 . For hardness, we construct a reduction from 2\u2212QBF . Let X and Y be two disjoint sets of atoms and P a formula such that Atom(P ) \u2286 X \u222a Y . Let Y = {y1, y2, ..., yk}; T1 be y1 \u2228 ... \u2228 yk; T2 be \u00acy1 \u2228 ... \u2228 \u00acyk; x and y be two new atoms different with X \u222a Y ; Q be (x\u2227y\u2227P )\u2228(x\u2227\u00acy\u2227T1)\u2228(\u00acx\u2227y\u2227T2). We now prove that \u2203X\u2200Y P holds if and only if x\u2227y strongly partially entails Q. Suppose that \u2203X\u2200Y P holds. Then, there exists an assignment \u03c00 over X such that \u03c00 |= P . By Proposition 2, there exists \u03c01 \u2286 \u03c00 such that \u03c01 is a prime implicant of P . Therefore, {x, y} \u222a \u03c01 |= Q. In addition, {x} \u222a \u03c01 6|= Q. Otherwise, {x} \u222a \u03c01 |= (x \u2227 y \u2227 P ) \u2228 (x \u2227 \u00acy \u2227 T1) \u2228 (\u00acx \u2227 y \u2227 T2). It follows that {x} \u222a \u03c01 |= y \u2228 T1, a contradiction. Symmetrically, {y} \u222a \u03c01 6|= Q. Moreover, for all l \u2208 \u03c01, {x, y} \u222a \u03c01\\{l} 6|= Q since \u03c01 is a prime implicant of P . This shows that {x, y} \u222a \u03c01 is a prime implicant of Q. Hence, x \u2227 y strongly partially entails Q. On the other hand, suppose that x \u2227 y strongly partially entails Q. Then, there exists a prime implicant of Q including both x and y. Let it be {x, y} \u222a \u03c01. Therefore \u03c01 |= P . We have \u03c01 6|= T1. Otherwise, {x} \u222a \u03c01 |= Q. This shows that {x, y} \u222a \u03c01 is not a prime implicant of Q, a contradiction. Symmetrically, \u03c01 6|= T2. This shows that Atom(\u03c01) \u2286 X. Moreover, {x, y} \u222a \u03c01 |= Q. It follows that {x, y} \u222a \u03c01 |= x \u2227 y \u2227 P . Therefore \u03c01 |= P . Let \u03c00 be an assignment over X such that \u03c01 \u2286 \u03c00. Then, \u03c00 |= P . This shows that \u2203X\u2200Y P holds.\nFor membership of WPE(P, \u03c0), P weakly partially entails \u03c0 iff a) P is satisfiable, and b) for all assignments \u03c01 over Atom\\Atom(\u03c0), \u03c01\u222a\u2212\u03c0 6|= P , which is equivalent to \u2212\u03c0 |= \u00acP . To prove this, suppose that P weakly partially entails \u03c0. Then, P is satisfiable. Now assume that there exists \u03c01 such that \u03c01 \u222a \u2212\u03c0 |= P . By Proposition 2, there exists \u03c02 \u2286 \u03c01 \u222a \u2212\u03c0 such that \u03c02 is a prime implicant of P . However, \u03c02 \u2229 \u03c0 = \u2205, a contradiction. On the other hand, suppose that the above three conditions hold. Then, for all prime implicants \u03c01 of P , \u03c01 \u2229 \u03c0 6= \u2205. Otherwise, \u03c01 \u222a \u2212\u03c0 can be extended to an assignment \u03c02 over Atom such that \u03c02 |= P . However, \u2212\u03c0 \u2286 \u03c02, a contradiction. Hence, WPE(P, \u03c0) is in DP.\nFor membership of PE(P, \u03c0), let \u03c0 = {l1, . . . , ln}. Then, P partially entails \u03c0 iff for all prime implicant \u03c0\u2032 of P , a) \u03c0\u2032 \u2229 \u2212\u03c0 = \u2205, and b) \u03c0\u2032 \u2229 \u03c0 6= \u2205 iff a) for all i, (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n), \u2212li is not in any of the prime implicants of P , and b) P weakly partially entails \u03c0. Hence, by Proposition 11 and the above result for weak partial entailment, this problem is in DP .\nFor membership of SPE(P, \u03c0), let \u03c0 = {l1, . . . , ln}, Atom(P )\\Atom(\u03c0) = {x1, . . ., xm}. P strongly partially entails \u03c0 iff all the prime implicants of P are subsets of \u03c0 iff for all i, (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n), \u2212li is not in any prime implicants of P and for all j, (1 \u2264 j \u2264 m), xj (\u00acxj) is not in any prime implicants of P . By Proposition 11, this problem is in coNP.\nFor WPE(P, Q), membership can be shown by the following algorithm, which determines whether P does not weakly partially entail Q: 1. guess a consistent literal set \u03c0; 2. check whether \u03c0 is a prime implicant of P ; 3. if yes, check whether \u03c0 does not weakly partially entail Q. By Proposition 11 and the above case for WPE(\u03c0, P), steps 2 and 3 require an NP oracle. Hence, this problem is in \u03a0P2 . For hardness, we construct a reduction from 2\u2212QBF . Let X and Y be two disjoint sets of atoms and P a formula such that Atom(P ) \u2286 X \u222a Y . Let Y = {y1, y2, ..., yk}. Formula T is (y1 \u2228 ... \u2228 yk) \u2227 (\u00acy1 \u2228 ... \u2228 \u00acyk). We prove that \u2203X\u2200Y P holds if and only if P does not weakly partially entail T . Suppose that \u2203X\u2200Y P holds. Then, there exists an assignment \u03c01 over X such that \u03c01 |= P . By Proposition\n2, there exists a prime implicant \u03c02 of P such that \u03c02 \u2286 \u03c01. Clearly, there is no prime implicant \u03c03 of T such that \u03c02 \u2229 \u03c03 6= \u2205. On the other hand, suppose that P does not weakly partially entail T . Then, there exists a prime implicant \u03c01 of P such that for all prime implicants \u03c02 of T , \u03c01 \u2229 \u03c02 = \u2205. It follows that Atom(\u03c01) \u2286 X. Then, \u03c01 can be extended to an assignment \u03c03 over X such that \u03c03 |= P . Hence, \u2203X\u2200Y P holds.\nFor PE(P, Q), membership can be shown by the following algorithm, which determines whether P does not partially entail Q: 1. guess a consistent literal set \u03c0; 2. check whether \u03c0 is a prime implicant of P ; 3. if yes, check whether \u03c0 does not partially entail Q. By Proposition 11 and the above case for PE(\u03c0, P), steps 2 and 3 require an NP oracle. Hence, this problem is in \u03a0P2 . For hardness, we construct a reduction from 2 \u2212 QBF . Let X and Y be two disjoint sets of atoms and P a formula such that Atom(P ) \u2286 X \u222a Y . Let X = {x1, x2, ..., xk}; X \u2032 = {x\u20321, x\u20322, ..., x\u2032k} be k new atoms different with Atom. Formula K is (x1 \u2194 x\u20321)\u2227 (x2 \u2194 x\u20322)\u2227 ...\u2227 (xk \u2194 x\u2032k). We prove that \u2200X\u2203Y P holds if and only if x\u2227K partially entails x \u2227 P , where x is a new atom. Notice that all the prime implicants of K have the form \u03c0 \u222a \u03c0\u2032, where \u03c0 (\u03c0\u2032) is an assignment over X (X \u2032) and for all i, (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k), xi \u2208 \u03c0 iff x\u2032i \u2208 \u03c0\u2032 (\u00acxi \u2208 \u03c0 iff \u00acx\u2032i \u2208 \u03c0\u2032). Now suppose that x \u2227K partially entails x \u2227 P . Then, for all assignments \u03c00 over X, {x} \u222a \u03c00 \u222a \u03c0\u20320 partially entails x\u2227 P . Therefore, there exists an assignment \u03c01 over Y such that {x} \u222a \u03c00 \u222a \u03c0\u20320 \u222a \u03c01 |= x \u2227 P . It follows that \u03c00 \u222a \u03c01 |= P . This shows that \u2200X\u2203Y P holds. On the other hand, suppose that \u2200X\u2203Y P holds. Then, for all assignments \u03c00 over X, there exists an assignment \u03c01 over Y , such that \u03c00 \u222a \u03c01 |= P . Therefore, for all prime implicants {x} \u222a \u03c00 \u222a \u03c0\u20320 of x \u2227K, there exists an assignment \u03c01 over Y such that {x} \u222a \u03c00 \u222a \u03c0\u20320 \u222a \u03c01 |= x \u2227 P . Moreover, there exists an assignment \u03c02 = {\u00acx} \u222a \u03c00 \u222a \u03c0\u20320 over {x} \u222aX \u222aX \u2032, such that \u03c02 \u222a \u03c01 |= \u00ac(x \u2227 P ). Hence, x \u2227K partially entails x \u2227 P .\nFinally for SPE(P, Q), membership can be shown by the following algorithm, which determines whether P does not strongly partially entail Q: 1. guess a consistent literal set \u03c0; 2. check whether \u03c0 is a prime implicant of P ; 3. if yes, check whether \u03c0 doesn\u2019t strongly partially entails Q. By Proposition 11, step 2 requires an NP oracle; by the above case for SPE(\u03c0, P), step 3 requires a \u03a3P2 oracle. Hence, this problem is in \u03a0 P 3 . For hardness, we construct a reduction from 3 \u2212 QBF . Let X, Y and Z be three disjoint sets of atoms and P a formula such that Atom(P ) \u2286 X \u222a Y \u222a Z. Suppose that X = {x1, x2, ..., xk}. Let X \u2032 = {x\u20321, x\u20322, ..., x\u2032k} be k new atoms. Let K be the formula (x1 \u2194 x\u20321) \u2227 (x2 \u2194 x\u20322) \u2227 ... \u2227 (xk \u2194 x\u2032k). Suppose that Z = {z1, z2, ..., zk}. Let T1 be z1 \u2228 ...\u2228 zk and T2 be \u00acz1 \u2228 ...\u2228\u00aczk respectively. Let R be the formula x\u2227 y \u2227K and Q be the formula (x\u2227y\u2227P \u2227K)\u2228 (x\u2227\u00acy\u2227T1\u2227K)\u2228 (\u00acx\u2227y\u2227T2\u2227K) respectively, where x and y are two new atoms. Next, we will prove that \u2200X\u2203Y \u2200ZP holds if and only if R strongly partially entails Q. The proof is tedious. On the one hand, suppose that \u2200X\u2203Y \u2200ZP holds. Given a prime implicant of R of the form {x, y} \u222a \u03c0 \u222a \u03c0\u2032, where \u03c0 is an assignment over X and \u03c0\u2032 is a corresponding assignment over X \u2032. Then, there exists an assignment \u03c01 over Y such that \u03c0 \u222a \u03c01 |= P . Therefore, {x, y} \u222a \u03c0 \u222a \u03c0\u2032 \u222a \u03c01 |= x \u2227 y \u2227 P \u2227K. It follows that {x, y} \u222a \u03c0 \u222a \u03c0\u2032 \u222a \u03c01 |= Q. By Proposition 2, there exists a subset \u03c02 of {x, y} \u222a \u03c0 \u222a \u03c0\u2032 \u222a \u03c01, which is a prime implicant of Q. We have that x \u2208 \u03c02. Otherwise, {y} \u222a \u03c0 \u222a \u03c0\u2032 \u222a \u03c01 |= Q. Therefore {y} \u222a \u03c0 \u222a \u03c0\u2032 \u222a \u03c01 |= x \u2228 T2, a contradiction. Symmetrically, y \u2208 \u03c02. Moreover, for each atom l \u2208 \u03c0 \u222a \u03c0\u2032, we have that l \u2208 \u03c02 since \u03c02 |= K. Therefore {x, y} \u222a \u03c0 \u222a \u03c0\u2032 \u2286 \u03c02. This shows that for all prime implicants of R, there exists a prime implicant of Q such that\nthe former is a subset of the latter. Hence, R strongly partially entails Q. On the other hand, suppose that R strongly partially entails Q. Notice that for all assignments \u03c0 over X, {x, y} \u222a \u03c0 \u222a \u03c0\u2032 is a prime implicant of R. Therefore, there is a prime implicant of Q that contains {x, y} \u222a \u03c0 \u222a \u03c0\u2032. Let it be {x, y} \u222a \u03c0 \u222a \u03c0\u2032 \u222a \u03c01, where Atom(\u03c01) \u2286 Y \u222a Z. Therefore, \u03c0 \u222a \u03c01 |= P . We have that \u03c01 6|= T1. Otherwise, {x} \u222a \u03c0 \u222a \u03c0\u2032 \u222a \u03c01 |= Q, a contradiction. Symmetrically, \u03c01 6|= T2. This shows that Atom(\u03c01) \u2286 Y . Thus, \u03c01 can be extended to an assignment \u03c02 over Y . We have that {x, y} \u222a \u03c0 \u222a \u03c0\u2032 \u222a \u03c02 |= Q. Therefore {x, y}\u222a\u03c0\u222a\u03c0\u2032\u222a\u03c02 |= x\u2227y\u2227P \u2227K. Hence, \u03c0\u222a\u03c02 |= P . This shows that for all assignments \u03c0 over X, there exists an assignment \u03c02 over Y , such that \u03c0\u222a\u03c02 |= P . That is, \u2200X\u2203Y \u2200ZP holds. 2\nProposition 13 All the complexity results in Tables 3 and 4 remain the same if the background theory is a set of literals.\nProof: This assertion follows directly from the following fact:\nSuppose that P is a formula and \u03c0 is a consistent set of literals. Then, PI(\u03c0, P ) = PI(P |\u03c0).\nOn one hand, suppose that \u03c01 \u2208 PI(\u03c0, P ). Then, according to the definition, \u03c01 \u222a \u03c0 is consistent and \u03c01 \u222a \u03c0 |= P . We have that Atom(\u03c01) \u2229 Atom(\u03c0) = \u2205. Otherwise, suppose that l \u2208 Atom(\u03c01) \u2229 Atom(\u03c0), then \u03c01 \u222a \u03c0\\{l} |= P . Also, \u03c01 \u222a \u03c0\\{l} is consistent. This shows that \u03c01 is not a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u03c0, a contradiction. Moreover, \u03c01\u222a\u03c0 |= P . It follows that \u03c01 |= P |\u03c0. In addition, there does not exist \u03c02 \u2282 \u03c01 such that \u03c02 |= P |\u03c0. Otherwise, \u03c02\u222a\u03c0 |= P and \u03c02\u222a\u03c0 is consistent. This shows that \u03c01 is not a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u03c0, a contradiction. Hence, \u03c01 is a prime implicant of P |\u03c0. On the other hand, suppose that \u03c01 is a prime implicant of P |\u03c0. Then, Atom(\u03c01) \u2229 Atom(\u03c0) is empty since Atom(P |\u03c0) \u2229 Atom(\u03c0) is empty. In addition, \u03c01 \u222a \u03c0 |= P since \u03c01 |= P |\u03c0. Thus, \u03c01 \u222a \u03c0 is consistent. Moreover, there does not exist \u03c02 \u2282 \u03c01 such that \u03c02 \u222a \u03c0 |= P . Otherwise, \u03c02 |= P |\u03c0. This shows that \u03c01 is not a prime implicant of P |\u03c0, a contradiction. Hence, \u03c01 is a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u03c0. 2\nProposition 14 The computational complexities in relation to partial entailment in general case are summarized in Table 5.\nProof: The DP completeness for PRIC(\u0393, P, \u03c0) follows directly from Proposition 1 and the DP completeness for PRIC(P, \u03c0). This can also be proved in a similar way to the techniques introduced by Marquis (2000) for proving the DP completeness for the corresponding decision problem of prime implicate (see Marquis, 2000, Proposition 3.36).\nFor LEPR(\u0393, P, l), the membership is easy by guessing a literal set \u03c0 and checking if l \u2208 \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u2208 PI(\u0393, P ). For hardness, it can be shown that \u2203X\u2200Y P iff x is in one of the elements in PI(\u0393, F ), where \u0393 = {\u00ac(x \u2227 P \u2227 (y1 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 yk))}, F = x \u2227 P \u2227 \u00ac(y1 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 yk) \u2228 \u00acx \u2227 (\u00acy1 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 \u00acyk), where x is a new atom. The proof is tedious. We only outline the basic ideas as follows. x is in one of the elements of PI(\u0393, F )\niff \u2203 \u03c0, x \u2208 \u03c0, \u03c0 6|= \u00ac \u2227 \u0393, \u03c0 |= \u2227 \u0393\u2192 F and \u2200\u03c0\u2032 \u2282 \u03c0, \u03c0\u2032 6|= \u2227 \u0393\u2192 F . iff \u2203 \u03c01, \u03c01 \u222a {x} 6|= \u00ac \u2227 \u0393, \u03c01 \u222a {x} |= \u00ac \u2227 \u0393 \u2228 F and \u03c01 6|= \u00ac \u2227 \u0393 \u2228 F . (Notice that \u03c01 \u222a {x} is not necessarily the same as \u03c0 mentioned above.) iff \u2203 \u03c01, \u03c01 6|= (\u00ac \u2227 \u0393)|x, \u03c01 |= (\u00ac \u2227 \u0393)|x \u2228 F |x and \u03c01 6|= (\u00ac \u2227 \u0393)|\u00acx \u2228 F |\u00acx. iff \u2203 \u03c01, \u03c01 6|= P \u2227 (y1 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 yk), \u03c01 |= P and \u03c01 6|= \u00acy1 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 \u00acyk. iff \u2203X\u2200Y P holds. In fact, the hardness result also follows from the \u03a3P2 completeness of checking relevance in abductive reasoning (see Eiter & Gottlob, 1995, Thm. 4.11).\nFor LAPR(\u0393, P, l), the membership can be shown by the following algorithm, which determines whether l is not in all prime implicants of P w.r.t. \u0393: 1. guess a literal set \u03c0; 2. check if \u03c0 is a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393; 3. if yes, check if l is not in \u03c0. According to the above result for prime implicant checking, this problem is in \u03a3P2 . Thus, the original problem is in \u03a0P2 . For harness, we can prove it in a similar way to the above proof for the \u03a3P2 hardness of LEPR(\u0393, P, l). Indeed, one can prove that \u2203X\u2200Y P iff x is in one of the elements of PI(\u0393, F ), where \u0393 = {\u00ac(x \u2227 z \u2227 P \u2227 (y1 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 yk))}, F = x \u2227 z \u2227 P \u2227 \u00ac(y1 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 yk) \u2228 \u00acx \u2227 \u00acz \u2227 (\u00acy1 \u2228 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2228 \u00acyk), where x and z are two new atoms. Moreover, x is in one of the elements of PI(\u0393, F ) iff \u00acx is not in all of the elements in PI(\u0393, F ) since every element in PI(\u0393, F ) contains either x or \u00acx. This shows that determining whether a literal is not in all prime implicants of a formula w.r.t. a formula set is \u03a3P2 hard. It follows that LAPR(\u0393, P, l) is \u03a0 P 2 hard.\nFor WPE(\u0393, P, Q), the \u03a0P2 hardness follows directly from Proposition 12. The \u03a3 P 2 hardness can be implied from the hardness proof of the \u03a3P2 hardness of LEPR(\u0393, P, l) by noticing that the only prime implicant of x w.r.t. \u0393 is {x} itself. For the membership, let us first consider the following algorithm, which determines whether P does not weakly partially entail Q w.r.t. \u0393: 1. compute all the literals which occur at least in one of the prime implicants of Q w.r.t. \u0393; 2. check whether there is a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393, which does not contain any of the literals computed in step 1. According to above result for the \u03a3P2 hardness of LEPR(\u0393, P, l), step 1 requires linear calls to a \u03a3P2 oracle. In addition, step 2 requires only one recall to a \u03a3P2 oracle based on the results obtained in step 1. To do this, we just need to guess a consistent literal set, and to check if it is a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393 and contains no literals computed from step 1. This algorithm can be converted to a \u03a3P2 -tree, in which the root is corresponding to the \u03a3P2 call for step 2, and its children are corresponding to the linear \u03a3P2 calls in step 1 for computing those literals. Thus, according the \u03a3 P 2 -tree techniques introduced by Gottlob (1995), WPE(\u0393, P, Q) is in \u2206P3 [O(log n)]. For PE(\u0393, P, Q), both the \u03a0P2 hardness and the \u03a3 P 2 hardness can be shown in a similar way to the corresponding tasks for weak partial entailment. For membership, the following algorithm determines whether there exists a prime implicant \u03c0\u2032 of Q w.r.t. \u0393, such that \u03c0 \u2229 \u03c0\u2032 = \u2205 or \u03c0 \u2229 \u2212\u03c0\u2032 6= \u2205: 1. guess such a literal set \u03c0\u2032; 2. check if \u03c0\u2032 is a prime implicant of Q w.r.t. \u0393; 3. check if \u03c0 and \u03c0\u2032 satisfy the conditions. According to the above result for prime implicant checking, step 2 requires calls to an NP oracle. Thus, the above decision problem is in \u03a3P2 . Based on this result, the following algorithm determines whether P does\nnot partially entail Q w.r.t. \u0393: 1. guess a literal set \u03c0; 2. check if \u03c0 is a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393; 3. check if there exists a prime implicant \u03c0\u2032 of Q w.r.t. \u0393 such that \u03c0 \u2229 \u03c0\u2032 = \u2205 or \u03c0 \u2229 \u2212\u03c0\u2032 6= \u2205. It is easy to see that this problem is in \u03a3P3 . Thus, the original problem is in \u03a0P3 .\nFinally, for SPE(\u0393, P, Q), hardness follows directly from Proposition 12, while membership can be shown in a similar way to the membership of the same task for partial entailment. 2"}], "references": [{"title": "Toward a logic for qualitative decision theory", "author": ["C.

This shows that determining whether a literal is not in all prime implicants of a formula w.r.t. a formula set is \u03a32 hard. It follows that LAPR(\u0393, P, l) is \u03a0 P 2 hard. For WPE(\u0393, P, Q), the \u03a02 hardness follows directly from Proposition 12. The \u03a3 P 2 hardness can be implied from the hardness proof of the \u03a32 hardness of LEPR(\u0393, P, l) by noticing that the only prime implicant of x w.r.t. \u0393 is {x} itself. For the membership, let us first consider the following algorithm, which determines whether P does not weakly partially entail Q w.r.t. \u0393: 1. compute all the literals which occur at least in one of the prime implicants of Q w.r.t. \u0393; 2. check whether there is a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393, which does not contain any of the literals computed in step 1. According to above result for the \u03a32 hardness of LEPR(\u0393, P, l), step 1 requires linear calls to a \u03a32 oracle. In addition, step 2 requires only one recall to a \u03a32 oracle based on the results obtained in step 1. To do this, we just need to guess a consistent literal set, and to check if it is a prime implicant of P w.r.t. \u0393 and contains no literals computed from step 1. This algorithm can be converted to a \u03a32 -tree, in which the root is corresponding to the \u03a32 call for step 2, and its children are corresponding to the linear \u03a32 calls in step 1 for computing those literals. Thus, according the \u03a3 P 2 -tree techniques introduced by Gottlob (1995), WPE(\u0393, P, Q) is in \u22063 [O(log n)].", "startOffset": 125, "endOffset": 2433}], "year": 2011, "abstractText": "We introduce a novel logical notion\u2013partial entailment\u2013to propositional logic. In contrast with classical entailment, that a formula P partially entails another formula Q with respect to a background formula set \u0393 intuitively means that under the circumstance of \u0393, if P is true then some \u201cpart\u201d of Q will also be true. We distinguish three different kinds of partial entailments and formalize them by using an extended notion of prime implicant. We study their semantic properties, which show that, surprisingly, partial entailments fail for many simple inference rules. Then, we study the related computational properties, which indicate that partial entailments are relatively difficult to be computed. Finally, we consider a potential application of partial entailments in reasoning about rational agents.", "creator": "TeX"}}}
