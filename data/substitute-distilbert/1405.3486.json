Intuitively, it use KF to denote an proposition F is believed to be true in each of the agent\u2019s belief sets, and MF to denote an proposition F is believed to be true in some of the agent\u2019s belief sets. This extension is believed to be useful by discussing its application to formalization of commonsense reasoning. Along its syntax and semantics in (Gelfond and Przymusinska 1991), a few efforts were made to establish reasoning algorithms in (Zhang 2006) and (Watson 1994), and theoretical foundation in (Zhang 2003), (Watson 2000), and (Wang and Zhang 2005). Recently, research on epistemic specifications increases again because introspective reasoning is becoming reality and forseeable as showed in (Faber and Woltran 2011), (Faber and Woltran 2009), and (Truszczyn\u0301ski 2011). To eliminate some unintended interpretations which exist under the original definition, a new semantics is defined in (Gelfond 2011) to arguably close to the intuitive meaning of modalities. Currently, efforts are still desired to made to establish and validate properties of epistemic specifications and the corresponding reasoning algorithms, and to investigate the use of the language. The design and implementation of an epistemic specification solver is hoped to facilitate those efforts.\nThis article introduces an epistemic specification solver ESmodels that is recently being designed and implemented as a flexible platform for experiment with epistemic specifications. The language of ESmodels has two types of subjective literals Kl and \u00acKl. To express other types\nof subjective literals, we propose a group of transformation rules rewriting epistemic specifications with arbitrary types of subjective literals in ESmodels\u2019s language. In ESmodels, a generate-test algorithm for computing world views of the epistemic specification is employed. It is worth noting that efficient ASP solver Clasp is coupled into ESmodels to help to generate candidate world views efficiently. Optimization approaches are preliminarily used to promoting the efficiency of the basic algorithm. Presently, we are applying ESmodels in solving security conditions in conformant planning, and encoding constraint satisfaction problems."}, {"heading": "2 Language", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Syntax and Semantics", "text": "An ESmodels\u2019s epistemic specification is a collection of finite rules in the following form\nl0 or...or lk : \u2212 lk+1, ..., lj , Slj+1, ..., Slm, not lm+1, ..., not ln\nwhere each li for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n is an objective literal, ie. either an atom A or the negation \u00acA of A, and S is either K or \u00acK, not is negation as failure.

Therefore, we introduce a new preprocessing function to reduce reduce EL(\u03a0) before generating all possible assignments of EL(\u03a0). We first give several propositions.\nLet \u03a0 be an epistemic specification and a pair (S, S\u2032) of objective literals of \u03a0, T\u03a0 be an lower bound operator on (S, S\u2032) defined as follows:\nT\u03a0(S, S \u2032) =\n(\n{head(r)||head(r)| = 1, body+(r) \u2286 S, body\u2212(r) \u2286 S\u2032},\n{l|\u00ac\u2203r \u2208 \u03a0(l \u2208 head(r)), or \u2200r \u2208 \u03a0, l \u2208 head(r) \u21d2 (body+(r) \u2229 S\u2032 6= \u2205 or body\u2212(r) \u2229 S 6= \u2205)} )\nwhere body+(r) = bodyP (r) \u222a bodyK(r), body\u2212(r) = bodyN (r) \u222a body\u2212K(r).

For any world view W of \u03a0, if S \u2229 ( \u22c2\nA\u2208W\n)\n== S\nand S\u2032 \u2229 ( \u22c2\nA\u2208W\n)\n== \u2205, then \u03a0W and (\u03a0|(S,S\u2032))W have the same answer sets. And, for any world view W of \u03a0|(S,S\u2032), we have that W is a world view of \u03a0.\nBy theorem 3 and 4, we can design PreProcess showed in algorithm 2. Firstly, it sets the pair (S, S \u2032 ) as (\u2205, \u2205). Then it expands the partial model of \u03a0 and reducts the \u03a0 \u2032 according to (S, S \u2032\n). Next, we updates the partial model by the new program. Finally, it compares the new partial model with the previous one. If the partial model is stable, it stops and returns \u03a0 \u2032\n; Otherwise, it repeats this procedure.\nAlgorithm 2 PreProcess.

We use nonexecutable to denote the actions are not executable, inconsistent to denote that a state is illegal, success to sign a state satisfies the goal, and goal(m) to denote the state reached after a given steps number m satisfies the goal, and o(A, T ) to denote an action A happens in the step T :\n- for security condition 1: \u2190 M nonexecutable. - for security condition 2: \u2190 M inconsistent. - for security condition 3: success \u2190 goal(m). and \u2190 \u00acK success.\nMoreover, to guarantee the above security testing is put on tracks caused by the same action sequence, we write a new constraint.\n\u2190 \u00acKo(A, T ), o(A, T ). (1)\nIntuitively, rule (1) says that if one action A happened in stage T of one track, it happened in stage T of all tracks. Thus, we can easily get a Conformant Planning Module consisting of the above five constraints and the following action generation rules:\n\u2022 Set a planning horizon m: #const x = m. step(0..x). \u2022 Generating one action for each step: 1{o(A, T ) : action(A)}1 \u2190 step(T ), T < m.\nCombine the conformant planning module with a planning domain (including action axioms e.g., inertial law) encoded in an answer set program, the result epistemic specification represents a conformant planning problem, and its world view(s) corresponds to the secure plan(s) of the problem. Here, we use a case provided in (Palacios and Geffner 2006) to demonstrate the conformant planning approach using epistemic specification. Given a conformant planning problem P with an initial state I = p \u2228 q (i.e., nothing else is known; there is no CWA), and action a and b with effects a causes q if r, a causes \u00acs if r, and b causes s if q, the planning goal is q, s. Then, we describe the planning domain as follows.\n\u2022 Signatures: action(a). action(b). f luent(in, p). f luent(in, q). f luent(in, r). f luent(in, s). \u2022 Causal Laws: h(pos(q), T + 1) : \u2212o(a, T ), h(pos(p), T ), step(T ). h(neg(s), T + 1) : \u2212o(a, T ), h(pos(r), T ), step(T ). h(pos(s), T + 1) : \u2212o(b, T ), h(pos(q), T ), step(T ). \u2022 Inertial Laws: h(pos(X), T + 1) : \u2212fluent(in,X), h(pos(X), T ), step(T ), not h(neg(X), T + 1).\nh(neg(X), T + 1) : \u2212fluent(in,X), h(neg(X), T ), step(T ), not h(pos(X), T + 1).\n\u2022 Initial: 1{h(pos(p), 0), h(pos(q), 0)}2. 1{h(pos(F ), 0), h(neg(F ), 0)}1 : \u2212fluent(in, F ). \u2022 Goal: goal(T ) : \u2212h(pos(q), T ), h(pos(s), T ), step(T ).\nWhen we set m = 2, ESmodels can find the unique world view including twelve literal sets, and each of them includes o(a, 0) and o(b, 1) that means the program has a conformant plan a b."}, {"heading": "4.2 Constraints Satisfaction", "text": "In some situations, constraints on the variable are with epistemic features, that is, a variable\u2019s value is not only affected by the values of other variables, but also determined by all possible values of other variables.

A significant feature of this solver is that its language is more compact than that defined in literatures, but capable of representing many subjective literals via a group of transformation rules. Besides, this solver can compute world views under Gelfond\u2019s new definition, while that presented by Zhang in (Zhang 2007) and Watson in (Watson 1994) are based on the early definition of epistemic specifications. In addition, we find the compact encoding of conformant planning problems and constraint satisfaction problems in the epistemic specification language, which primarily shows ESmodels\u2019s potential in applications1.\nThe work presented here is primary. Now, we are designing and exploring more efficient algorithm for ESmodels and evaluate it using those benchmarks in the conformant planning field."}, {"heading": "Acknowledgment", "text": "We acknowledge the support from Project 60803061 and 61272378 by National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Project BK2008293 by Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu.\n1 In the early related work, Gelfond investigated the value of epistemic specifications in formalizing commonsense reasoning"}], "references": [{"title": "A logic programming approach to knowledge-state planning, ii: The dlvk system", "author": ["T.
