By EU directives, regional policies on the energy sector should also include an environmental assessment of the plan. Being the plan so high-level, usually the assessment is done only in a qualitative way.\nIn a previous work (Gavanelli et al. 2010), we proposed and compared two alternative logic programming formulations for the strategic environmental assessment of regional plans; one was based on probabilistic logic programming, the other on Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) (Jaffar and Maher 1994). We also developed four fuzzy-logic formulations of the assessment problem (Gavanelli et al. 2011). All these programs consider a regional plan, given in input, and provide its environmental assessment. In a following work (Gavanelli et al. 2013), the CLP program was extended to generate plans together with their assessment, and it was used during the definition of the Regional Energy Plan 2011-2013 of the Emilia-Romagna region (Pilolli et al. 2011).\nIn this work, we show how the first prototype of the planner was extended to a fully-\nfledged application. In particular, the current version of the software supports:\n\u2022 plans that consider decommissioning obsolete power plants; \u2022 computation of emissions of the power plants for various types of pollutants, in a\nquantitative way;\n\u2022 quantitative assessment of the effect of the plan on human health, global warming, and acidification potential; \u2022 multi-criteria optimization considering a variety of objective functions based on qualitative and quantitative information; \u2022 computation of the Pareto front, for two or more objective functions; \u2022 a web service, providing access through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and APIs.\nThis work is one of the components of the EU ePolicy project1. The final application will include also an opinion mining component, to assess the acceptance of the policies from the public considering information coming from blogs and social networks; a social simulator component, that will simulate how the population will react to the policies\n1 http://www.epolicy-project.eu\nadopted by the Region; a mechanism design component, that will include information from game theory to provide the best allocation schemes of regional subsidies to the stakeholders; and an integrated visualization component.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first introduce the planning and environmental assessment as they are currently done by experts in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, and recap the basic CLP program of the first prototype (Section 2). In Section 3, we extend it with new features. We show the design and features of the web service and GUI in Section 4. Finally, we conclude in Section 5."}, {"heading": "2 Problem considered and CLP solution", "text": "The strategic environmental assessment, in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, is currently performed by considering two matrices, called coaxial matrices (Cagnoli 2010). They are a development of the network method (Sorensen and Moss 1973), and they contain qualitative relations.\nThe first matrix, M, considers the activities that can be undertaken in a plan, and links them with the environmental pressures. Pressures can be positive or negative, and they account for the impact on the environment of human activities. Each element mij of the matrix M can take values {high, medium, low, null}, and defines a qualitative dependency between the activity i and the negative or positive pressure j.\nThe second matrix, N , relates the pressures with the environmental receptors, that register the effect of the pressures on the environment. For example, the activity \u201ccoalfueled power plant\u201d generates the pressure \u201cemission of pollutants in the atmosphere\u201d; on its turn, this influences the receptor \u201cair quality\u201d (as well as other receptors, like e.g. \u201chuman wellbeing\u201d). Each element nij of the matrix can take the qualitative values: high, medium, low or null, and defines the dependency between pressure i and receptor j.\nCurrently, the matrices relate 115 activities with 29 negative and 19 positive pressures, and 23 receptors. They can be used to assess a variety of regional plans, including Agriculture, Forest, Fishing, Energy, Industrial, Transport, Waste, Water, Telecommunications, Tourism, Urban plans. The environmental assessment is usually done using a spreadsheet and deleting (by hand) those activities that do not belong to the given type of plan; then pressures and receptors that are not influenced by remaining activities are removed accordingly. The \u201creduced\u201d matrices are evaluated by environmental experts, that state which parts are most important, mainly considering clusters of High values.\nClearly, this process is very slow, experts might overlook important combinations of medium or low values, and, most importantly, it can be done only after the plan has been provided by the policy maker. At this stage, usually only minor modifications can be back-propagated to the plan, and comparing a plan\u2019s effects with alternative plans is not possible without starting another planning phase."}, {"heading": "2.1 A CLP solution", "text": "To overcome the limitations and improve on current practices, we devised a Decision Support System (DSS) able to provide optimal plans and environmental assessment (Gavanelli et al. 2013): the planning problem was modelled as a linear program in CLP on the Reals sort (CLP(R)).\nGiven a number Na of activities, we consider a vector A = (a1, . . . , aNa) in which we associate to each activity a variable ai that defines its magnitude. The domain of ai depends on the availability of the resource on the given Region; for example some regions are very windy, while others can exploit better biomasses or solar energy.\nWe distinguish primary from secondary activities: primary activities are directly related to the given type of plan, while secondary ones are those supporting the primary activities by providing the needed infrastructures. E.g. in an energy plan, primary activities are those producing energy (e.g., power plants), and they may require other activities (e.g., power lines, waste stocking, streets, etc.) that have an environmental impact too. Let AP be the set of indexes of primary activities and AS that of secondary activities. The dependencies between primary and secondary activities are considered by the constraint:\n\u2200j \u2208 AS aj = \u2211 i\u2208AP dijai (1)\nEach activity ai has a cost ci; given a budget BPlan available for a given plan, we have:\nNa\u2211 i=1 ai ci \u2264 BPlan (2)\nGiven an expected outcome outPlan of the plan, we also have:\nNa\u2211 i=1 ai outi \u2265 outPlan. (3)\nE.g. an energy plan outcome can be to increase available energy, so outPlan could be the added availability of electrical power (in kilo-TOE, Tonnes of Oil Equivalent). Other outcomes can be considered, e.g. increasing only renewable energies.\nConcerning the impacts of the regional plan, an environmental expert suggested to convert the qualitative values in the matrices into coefficients ranging from 0 to 1; we sum up the contributions of all the activities to estimate the impact on each pressure:\n\u2200j \u2208 {1, . . . , Np} pj = Na\u2211 i=1 mij ai. (4)\nSimilarly, given the pressures P = (p1, . . . , pNp), the influence on the environmental receptor ri is estimated through the matrix N , relating pressures with receptors:\n\u2200j \u2208 {1, . . . , Nr} rj = Np\u2211 i=1 nijpi. (5)\nPossible objective functions include maximizing/minimizing the produced energy, the\ncost, or one of the receptors (e.g., \u201cair quality\u201d), or a linear combination of the above."}, {"heading": "3 Extended solution", "text": "The CLP(R) program described in Section 2.1 was used in the development of the 2011- 13 Regional Energy plan of the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy: the plan objective was to increase the share of renewable energy in the energy mix, and to fulfil the 20-20-20 directive. For the next years experts foresee the decommissioning of carbon-based power\nplants, with a residual utilisation when renewable energy is unavailable or in peak hours. Region experts asked us to extend the DSS to consider also the closing of power plants.\nPower plants decomissioning implies that some activities have a negative magnitude: e.g., the magnitude, in MW, of oil-based power plants could be reduced w.r.t. the previous years. However, negative activities introduce non-linearities. For example, if building a new plant i has a cost ci in e/MW , decommisioning it will not give a profit of ci e/MW . Our implementation is based on the ECLiPSe CLP language (Apt and Wallace 2007; Schimpf and Shen 2012), using the eplex library (Shen and Schimpf 2005). The eplex library uses very fast solvers using linear programming or mixed-integer linear programming algorithms, allowing the use of linear constraints on variables ranging either on continuous or on integer domains. It is well known that linear programming is polynomially solvable, while (mixed) integer linear programming is NP-hard; thus the efficiency of the solution depends on whether there are integer variables or not. To address the non-linearity, we introduced, for each activity ai that has negative values in its domain, a real variable Posi defined as:\nPosi = { ai if ai \u2265 0 0 if ai < 0\nThe cost constraint (2) is now rewritten as:\nNa\u2211 i=1 Posi ci \u2264 BPlan. (6)\nSimilarly, secondary activities should not be decommisisoned together with primary ones; so we impose their relationship only with the positive part of primary activities.\nConcerning the environmental assessment, we may notice that any new activity has different types of impacts, some related to its initial implementation (e.g., land use for building a coal power plant), and others due to the activity functioning (e.g., air pollution for burning fuel). Equation (4) correctly accounts for both when dealing with \u201cpositive\u201d activities, while would be incorrect w.r.t. \u201cnegative\u201d activities.\nTo cope with the activities decommissioning, the co-axial matrices have been extended with new activities (e.g., \u201cReduced use of fossil fuelled power plants\u201d). All the pressures are now computed on positive activities only, and Equation (4) is substituted with\n\u2200j \u2208 {1, . . . , Np} pj = Na\u2211 i=1 mij Posi. (7)\nWe considered the new activities as a new type of secondary activities: the \u201cReduced use of fossil fuelled power plants\u201d is a secondary activity that becomes positive only when activities like \u201cCoal-based power plant\u201d, etc., has a negative value (i.e., in case of decommissions). Hence, we now have two matrices of dependencies between activities: a Na \u00d7Na square matrix D+ where each element d+ij represents the magnitude of activity j per unit of activity i; and another Na \u00d7Na square matrix D\u2212 where each element d\u2212ij represents the magnitude of activity j per unit of reduction of activity i. Equation (1) is updated with\n\u2200j \u2208 AS aj = \u2211 i\u2208AP Kij Kij = { d+ij \u00b7 ai if ai \u2265 0 d\u2212ij \u00b7 (\u2212ai) if ai < 0\n(8)"}, {"heading": "3.1 Computing emissions", "text": "A further extension to the model presented in Section 2.1 has been about the evaluation of emissions in quantitative terms. To this end, we rely on the data provided by two databases: INEMAR (Caserini et al. 2002) and ISPRA (ISPRA): both databases provide the various types of pollutants 2 emitted per fuel unit (in GJ). While ISPRA provides the average emission for each plant type, INEMAR provides fine grained information, in which also the type of boiler and the size of the plant (in MW) are considered.\nLet NB the number of boiler types, and B = (b1, . . . , bNB ) a vector of constrained variables where bi is the total output power of plants using boiler type i. Let O be the matrix that relates power plants and the different kinds of boiler: each element oij of the matrix is set to if the boiler bj \u2208 B can be used for the power plant ai \u2208 A, and zero otherwise. The output power of each plant type is the sum of the power of its boilers:\n\u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , Na} ai = \u2211 j\u2208NB oijbj (9)\nLet E = (e1, . . . , eNe) be the vector of emissions and T the matrix relating them with the boilers. An element tij \u2208 T represents the grams of pollutant ei \u2208 E emitted when 1GJ of fuel is provided to the boiler bj \u2208 B. To calculate the emissions, we have to compute the input energy for each boiler type j, provided the output power bj :\n\u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , Ne} ei = \u2211 j\u2208NB tij ( TU \u03b7 bj ) . (10)\nTU is the average running time of a power plant per year (necessary to convert energy into power) and \u03b7 is the average efficiency (output power/input power) of power plants, which is prescribed by law as 39% (Autorita\u0300 per l\u2019Energia Elettrica e il Gas 2008)."}, {"heading": "3.2 Indicators", "text": "Thanks to the extension presented in Section 3.1 it is possible to evaluate quantitatively the emissions of some gases, metals, etc. Such data can be exploited to consider plans aiming to minimize them; however, it is not clear how to compare the emissions. E.g., a policy maker could know that NOX are toxic for humans, but how does that compare with heavy metal emissions?\nThe European Commission (2006) published a set of indicators quantifying the effect of various substances on human toxicity, global warming and acidification: e.g., the Annex 1 contains 100 chemicals with their human toxicity factor, defined as the toxicity of the substance compared to that of lead (Pb). By using the weights in the tables, one can provide, e.g., the total human toxicity (in kg of equivalent emitted Pb), the global warming effect (kg of equiv. CO2) and the acidification of the plan (kg of equiv. SO2). Moreover, a policy maker may want to optimize on these indicators (by directly minimizing them or any weighted sum).\n2 Considered types of pollutants include Sulfur Oxides (SOX), Nitrogen Oxides (NOX), methane, CO, CO2, N2O, ammonia, Hexachlorobenzene (HCB), various metals (Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Mercury, Nickel, lead, Selenium, Zinc), particulate matter (PM10), Dioxins, and some families of compounds, like Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon compounds (PAH), Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), and Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOC).\nHowever, the tables provided by the EC do not always have the same granularity of the information available for emissions. For example, for each plant type we know the emissions of NOX , while in the EU report there are the single toxicity values of NO and NO2 (and they are quite different: respectively, 95 and 300 times that of Pb). Environmental experts suggested to provided as output, for each indicator, the best, worst, and average cases, considering respectively the highest toxicity in the compound class, the lowest and an average. If one of the indicators is in the objective function (e.g., one wants to find the plan with minimum human toxicity), we optimize the worst case."}, {"heading": "3.3 Computing the Pareto front", "text": "The approach presented in Section 2 allows to optimize w.r.t. a single function. However, in the case of regional planning it is very hard (if not impossible) to devise a unique function that includes all the objectives that are important for the user. Hence, we added a further extension towards multi-objective optimization.\nIn a multi-objective optimization problem, a solution is Pareto optimal if it is not possible to improve the result for one objective function, without worsening at least another objective function. More precisely, in a multi-objective problem with n functions to minimize, a solution \u00b5\u2217 is Pareto-optimal if there does not exist another solution \u00b5 such that \u00b5j \u2264 \u00b5\u2217j for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n and there exists at least one i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n such that \u00b5i < \u00b5 \u2217 i . The set of Pareto points is distributed on the so-called Pareto frontier.\nWe implemented the normalized normal constraint method (Messac et al. 2003), an algorithm that works with any type of constraints (linear and nonlinear) and variables (continuous and discrete), and that is able to find an evenly distributed set of Pareto solutions. In this way, the policy maker is provided with a set of solutions that are a good representation of the whole space of the Pareto frontier."}, {"heading": "4 Graphical User Interface", "text": "Usually, policy makers are not IT-experts. To ease the access to the DSS, we deployed the CLP planner as a stateless Web service and access it by means of a stateful Web application. The CLP program is embedded inside a Java wrapper (Fig. 1a) that encodes\nthe requests in CLP terms and decodes the results. This component provides a plethora of Java classes that represent the Business Object Model (BOM) of this domain. Any query addressed to this component and all the returned results are expressed in terms of these objects. We adopted the Apache CXF framework to support the Web Service imlpementation. The Web application that stands as a GUI for the Web service is a standard Java servlet (Fig. 1b) following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and can be accessed at: http://globalopt.epolicy-project.eu/Pareto/.\nAfter a welcome page that introduces the software, there are an input page, and a results page. As input the user can provide minimum and maximum bounds for each energy source, constraints, and objective functions for the Pareto optimization (together with a desired number of Pareto points). Constraints and objectives can include linear combinations of cost, produced power, receptors, emissions, or indicators.\nAs a result, a set of graphs allow to inspect details on a specific plan (scenario), and/or to compare the computed plans. Scenarios are divided into boundary scenarios, that are those that optimize one of the objective functions, and intermediate scenarios, that try to balance the various objectives.\nScenarios comparison. Scenarios can be compared through a spiderweb chart (Fig. 2a) that has an axis for each objective function. Along each axis, the optimal values are far from the origin, and each scenario is represented by a polygon. Roughly speaking, a bigger polygon implies a better scenario (note that these solutions are Pareto optimal, so one polygon cannot be completely included into another polygon).\nScenarios can also be compared through stacked bar chart, showing, for each scenario, the distribution of costs per energy source (Fig. 2b), or the amount of electric/thermal energy per source. Moreover, a further view provides scenarios comparison in terms of pollutants (Heavy metals, Greenhouse gases, and Other pollutants), by means of basic column charts.\nScenarios Details. For each scenario, the following views are available:\n\u2022 Receptors. This composite view uses 7 VU-meter charts (Fig. 3a). The top part\nshows the 3 receptors with the best normalised value, while the bottom one the 3 with the worst normalised value. The main chart allows the user to select any receptor and appraise its normalised value. This specific view ensures fast access to the best and worst receptors for the specific scenario.\n\u2022 Other views. There are four interactive tabular views (Fig. 3b) showing respectively, for the chosen scenario, the amount of produced energy per source, the total\ncost for each energy source to be spent in primary and secondary activities, the detailed costs for each activity, and the list of emissions."}, {"heading": "5 Conclusions and Future Work", "text": "We presented a decision support system with optimization based on CLP for the regional planning, with particular emphasis on the environmental aspects. The program was practically used to produce the energy plan 2011-2013 of the Emilia-Romagna region in Italy (Pilolli et al. 2011), and it is foreseen to use it also for the forthcoming plans.

The CLP program will be the heart of the platform of the EU FP7 ePolicy project, that will also include components like a social simulator, an opinion miner, and a mechanism designer, all governed by the described CLP program. Preliminary work has been done on its integration with the mechanism designer (Milano et al. 2012), and a social simulator (Borghesi et al. 2013).\nFuture work will be on extending the model at a more detailed level, e.g. taking into\naccount decommissioning fixed costs.\nAcknowledgements.

Leveraging on previous work on Strategic Environmental Assessment, we developed a fullyfledged system that is able to provide optimal plans with respect to a given objective, to perform multi-objective optimization and provide sets of Pareto optimal plans, and to visually compare them. Each plan is environmentally assessed and its footprint is evaluated. The heart of the system is an application developed in a popular Constraint Logic Programming system on the Reals sort.
