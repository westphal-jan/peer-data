In these extensions one can represent, for instance, knowledge expressing the fact that the hematocrit level is usually under 50%, with the exceptions of newborns and of males residing at high altitudes, that have usually much higher levels (even over 65%). Furthermore, one can infer that an individual enjoys all the typical properties of the classes it belongs to. As an example, in the absence of information that Carlos and the son of Fernando are either newborns or adult males living at a high altitude, one would assume that the hematocrit levels of Carlos and Fernando\u2019s son are under 50%. This kind of inferences apply to individual explicitly named in the knowledge base as well as to individuals implicitly introduced by relations among individuals (the son of Fernando).\nIn spite of the number of works in this direction, finding a solution to the problem of extending DLs for reasoning about prototypical properties seems far from being solved. The most well known semantics for nonmonotonic reasoning have been used to the purpose, from default logic [1], to circumscription [2], to Lifschitz\u2019s nonmonotonic logic MKNF [10, 25], to preferential reasoning [13, 4, 17], to rational closure [6, 9].\nIn this work, we focus on rational closure and, specifically, on the rational closure for SHIQ. The interest of rational closure in DLs is that it provides a significant and reasonable nonmonotonic inference mechanism, still remaining computationally inexpensive. As shown for ALC in [6], its complexity can be expected not to exceed the one of the underlying monotonic DL. This is a striking difference with most of the other approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning in DLs mentioned above, with some exception such as [25, 22]. More specifically, we define a rational closure for the logic SHIQ, building on the notion of rational closure in [23] for propositional logic. This is a difference with respect to the rational closure construction introduced in [6] for ALC, which is more similar to the one by Freund [12] for propositional logic (for propositional logic, the two definitions of rational closure are shown to be equivalent [12]). We provide a\nsemantic characterization of rational closure in SHIQ in terms of a preferential semantics, by generalizing to SHIQ the results for rational closure in ALC presented in [18]. This generalization is not trivial, since SHIQ lacks a crucial property of ALC , the finite model property [19]. Our construction exploits an extension of SHIQ with a typicality operator T, that selects the most typical instances of a concept C, T(C). We define a minimal model semantics and a notion of minimal entailment for the resulting logic, SHIQRT, and we show that the inclusions belonging to the rational closure of a TBox are those minimally entailed by the TBox, when restricting to canonical models. This result exploits a characterization of minimal models, showing that we can restrict to models with finite ranks. We also show that the rational closure construction of a TBox can be done exploiting entailment in SHIQ, without requiring to reason in SHIQRT, and that the problem of deciding whether an inclusion belongs to the rational closure of a TBox is in EXPTIME.\nConcerning ABox reasoning, because of the interaction between individuals (due to roles) it is not possible to separately assign a unique minimal rank to each individual and alternative minimal ranks must be considered. We end up with a kind of skeptical inference with respect to the ABox, whose complexity in EXPTIME as well.\n2 A nonmonotonic extension of SHIQ\nFollowing the approach in [14, 17], we introduce an extension of SHIQ [19] with a typicality operator T in order to express typical inclusions, obtaining the logic SHIQRT. The intuitive idea is to allow concepts of the form T(C), whose intuitive meaning is that T(C) selects the typical instances of a concept C. We can therefore distinguish between the properties that hold for all instances of C (C \u2291 D), and those that only hold for the typical such instances (T(C) \u2291 D). Since we are dealing here with rational closure, we attribute to T properties of rational consequence relation [23]. We consider an alphabet of concept names C, role names R, transitive roles R+ \u2286 R, and individual constants O. Given A \u2208 C, S \u2208 R, and n \u2208 N we define:\nCR := A | \u22a4 | \u22a5 | \u00acCR | CR \u2293 CR | CR \u2294 CR | \u2200S.CR | \u2203S.CR | (\u2265 nS.CR) | (\u2264 nS.CR) CL := CR | T(CR) S := R | R \u2212\nAs usual, we assume that transitive roles cannot be used in number restrictions [19]. A KB is a pair (TBox, ABox). TBox contains a finite set of concept inclusions CL \u2291 CR and role inclusions R \u2291 S. ABox contains assertions of the form CL(a) and S(a, b), where a, b \u2208 O. The semantics of SHIQRT is formulated in terms of rational models: ordinary models of SHIQ are equipped with a preference relation < on the domain, whose intuitive meaning is to compare the \u201ctypicality\u201d of domain elements, that is to say, x < y means that x is more typical than y. Typical instances of a concept C (the instances of T(C)) are the instances x of C that are minimal with respect to the preference relation < (so that there is no other instance of C preferred to x)4.\nIn the following definition we introduce the notion of\n4 As for the logic ALCRT in [15], an alternative semantic characterization of T can be given by means of a set of postulates that are essentially a reformulation of the properties of rational consequence relation [23].\nDefinition 1 (Semantics of SHIQRT). A SHIQRT model 5 M is any structure \u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 where:\n\u2013 \u2206 is the domain; \u2013 < is an irreflexive, transitive, well-founded, and modular relation over \u2206; \u2013 I is the extension function that maps each concept C to CI \u2286 \u2206, and each role R to RI \u2286 \u2206I \u00d7 \u2206I . For concepts of SHIQ, CI is defined as usual. For the T operator, we have (T(C))I = Min<(CI), where Min<(S) = {u : u \u2208 S and \u2204z \u2208 S s.t. z < u}.\nWe say that an irreflexive and transitive relation < is:\n\u2013 modular if, for all x, y, z \u2208 \u2206, if x < y then x < z or z < y [23]; \u2013 well-founded if, for all S \u2286 \u2206, for all x \u2208 S, either x \u2208 Min<(S) or \u2203y \u2208 Min<(S) such that y < x.\nIt can be proved that an irreflexive and transitive relation < on \u2206 is well-founded if and only if there are no infinite descending chains . . . xi+1 <\u2217 xi <\u2217 . . . <\u2217 x0 of elements of \u2206 (see Appendix B).\nIn [23] it is shown that, for a strict partial order < over a set W , the modularity requirement is equivalent to postulating the existence of a rank function k : W \u2192 \u2126, such that \u2126 is a totally ordered set. In the presence of the well-foundedness condition above, the totally ordered set \u2126 happens to be a well-order, and we can introduce a rank function kM : \u2206 7\u2212\u2192 Ord assigning an ordinal to each domain element in W , and let x < y if and only if kM(x) < kM(y). We call kM(x) the rank of element x in M. Observe that, when the rank kM(x) is finite, it can be understood as the length of a chain x0 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < x from x to a minimal x0 (i.e. an x0 s.t. for no x\u2032, x\u2032 < x0).\nNotice that the meaning of T can be split into two parts: for any x of the domain \u2206, x \u2208 (T(C))I just in case (i) x \u2208 CI , and (ii) there is no y \u2208 CI such that y < x. In order to isolate the second part of the meaning of T, we introduce a new modality . The basic idea is simply to interpret the preference relation< as an accessibility relation. The well-foundedness of < ensures that typical elements of CI exist whenever CI 6= \u2205, by avoiding infinitely descending chains of elements. The interpretation of in M is as follows:\nDefinition 2. Given a model M, we extend the definition of I with the following clause:\n( C)I = {x \u2208 \u2206 | for every y \u2208 \u2206, if y < x then y \u2208 CI}\nIt is easy to observe that x is a typical instance of C if and only if it is an instance of C and \u00acC, that is to say:\nProposition 1. Given a model M, given a concept C and an element x \u2208 \u2206, we have that\nx \u2208 (T(C))I iff x \u2208 (C \u2293 \u00acC)I\n5 In this paper, we follow the terminology in [23] for preferential and ranked models, and we use the term \u201cmodel\u201d to denote an an interpretation.\nSince we only use to capture the meaning of T, in the following we will always use the modality followed by a negated concept, as in \u00acC.\nIn the next definition of a model satisfying a knowledge base, we extend the function I to individual constants; we assign to each individual constant a \u2208 O a domain element aI \u2208 \u2206.\nDefinition 3 (Model satisfying a knowledge base). Given a SHIQRT model M= \u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009, we say that:\n\u2013 a model M satisfies an inclusion C \u2291 D if CI \u2286 DI ; similarly for role inclusions; \u2013 M satisfies an assertion C(a) if aI \u2208 CI ; \u2013 M satisfies an assertion R(a, b) if (aI , bI) \u2208 RI .\nGiven a KB=(TBox,ABox), we say that: M satisfies TBox if M satisfies all inclusions in TBox; M satisfies ABox if M satisfies all assertions in ABox; M satisfies KB (or, is a model of KB) if it satisfies both its TBox and its ABox.\nAs a difference with the approach in [17], we do no longer assume the unique name assumption (UNA), namely we do not assume that each a \u2208 O is assigned to a distinct element aI \u2208 \u2206. In ALC + Tmin [17], in which we compare models that might have a different interpretation of concepts and that are not canonical, UNA avoids that models in which two named individuals are mapped into the same domain element are preferred to those in which they are mapped into distinct ones. UNA is not needed here as we compare models with the same domain and the same interpretation of concepts, while assuming that models are canonical (see Definition 9) and contain all the possible domain elements \u201ccompatible\u201d with the KB.\nThe logic SHIQRT, as well as the underlying SHIQ, does not enjoy the finite model property [19].\nGiven a KB, we say that an inclusion CL \u2291 CR is entailed by KB, written KB |=SHIQRT CL \u2291 CR, if CL I \u2286 CR I holds in all models M =\u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 satisfying KB; similarly for role inclusions. We also say that an assertion CL(a), with a \u2208 O, is entailed by KB, written KB |=SHIQRT CL(a), if a I \u2208 CL I holds in all models M =\u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 satisfying KB. Let us now introduce the notions of rank of a SHIQ concept.\nDefinition 4 (Rank of a concept kM(CR)). Given a model M =\u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009, we define the rank kM(CR) of a concept CR in the model M as kM(CR) = min{kM(x) | x \u2208 CR I}. If CR I = \u2205, then CR has no rank and we write kM(CR) = \u221e.\nProposition 2. For any M =\u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009, we have that M satisfies T(C) \u2291 D if and only if kM(C \u2293D) < kM(C \u2293 \u00acD).\nIt is immediate to verify that the typicality operator T itself is nonmonotonic: T(C) \u2291 D does not imply T(C \u2293 E) \u2291 D. This nonmonotonicity of T allows to express the properties that hold for the typical instances of a class (not only the properties that hold for all the members of the class). However, the logic SHIQRT is monotonic: what is inferred from KB can still be inferred from any KB\u2019 with KB \u2286 KB\u2019. This is a clear limitation in DLs. As a consequence of the monotonicity of SHIQRT, one cannot\ndeal with irrelevance. For instance, if typical VIPs have more than two marriages, we would like to conclude that also typical tall VIPs have more than two marriages, since being tall is irrelevant with respect to being married. However, KB= {VIP \u2291 Person , T(Person) \u2291 \u2264 1 HasMarried .Person , T(VIP) \u2291 \u2265 2 HasMarried .Person} does not entail KB |=SHIQRT T(VIP \u2293 Tall ) \u2291 \u2265 2 HasMarried .Person , even if the property of being tall is irrelevant with respect to the number of marriages. Observe that we do not want to draw this conclusion in a monotonic way from SHIQRT, since otherwise we would not be able to retract it when knowing, for instance, that typical tall VIPs have just one marriage (see also Example 1). Rather, we would like to obtain this conclusion in a nonmonotonic way. In order to obtain this nonmonotonic behavior, we strengthen the semantics of SHIQRT by defining a minimal models mechanism which is similar, in spirit, to circumscription. Given a KB, the idea is to: 1. define a preference relation among SHIQRT models, giving preference to the model in which domain elements have a lower rank; 2. restrict entailment to minimal SHIQRT models (w.r.t. the above preference relation) of KB.\nDefinition 5 (Minimal models). Given M =\u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 and M\u2032 = \u3008\u2206\u2032, <\u2032, I \u2032\u3009 we say that M is preferred to M\u2032 (M <FIMS M\u2032) if (i) \u2206 = \u2206\u2032, (ii) CI = CI \u2032\nfor all concepts C, and (iii) for all x \u2208 \u2206, kM(x) \u2264 kM\u2032(x) whereas there exists y \u2208 \u2206 such that kM(y) < kM\u2032(y). Given a KB, we say that M is a minimal model of KB with respect to <FIMS if it is a model satisfying KB and there is no M\u2032 model satisfying KB such that M\u2032 <FIMS M.\nThe minimal model semantics introduced above is similar to the one introduced in [17] forALC . However, it is worth noticing that the notion of minimality here is based on the minimization of the ranks of the worlds, rather then on the minimization of formulas of a specific kind. Differently from [17], here we only compare models in which the interpretation of concepts is the same. In this respect, the minimal model semantics above is similar to the minimal model semantics FIMS, introduced in [16] to provide a semantic characterization to rational closure in propositional logic. In FIMS, the interpretation of propositions in the models to be compared is fixed. In contrast, in the alternative semantic characterization VIMS, models are compared in which the interpretation of propositions may vary. Although fixing the interpretation of propositions (or concepts) can appear to be rather restrictive, for the propositional case, it has been proved in [16] that the two semantic characterizations (VIMS and FIMS) are equivalent under suitable assumptions and, in particular, under the assumption that in FIMS canonical models are considered. Similarly to FIMS, here we compare models by fixing the interpretation of concepts, and we also restrict our consideration to canonical models, as we will do in section 56. Let us define:\n6 Note that our language does not provide a direct way for minimizing roles. On the other hand, fixing roles does not appear to be very promising. Indeed, for circumscribed KBs, it has been proved in [2] that allowing role names to be fixed makes reasoning highly undecidabe. For the time being we have not studied the issue of allowing fixed roles in our minimal model semantics for SHIQRT.\nKF = {C \u2291 D \u2208 TBox : T does not occur in C}\u222a {R \u2291 S \u2208 TBox} \u222a ABox KD = {T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 TBox},\nso that KB = KF \u222aKD.\nProposition 3 (Existence of minimal models). Let KB be a finite knowledge base, if KB is satisfiable then it has a minimal model.\nProof. Let M = \u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 be a model of KB, where we assume that kM : \u2206 \u2212\u2192 Ord determines < and Ord is the set of ordinals. Define the relation"}, {"heading": "M \u2248 M\u2032 if M\u2032 = \u3008\u2206\u2032, <\u2032, I \u2032\u3009 and \u2206 = \u2206\u2032 and I = I \u2032", "text": "where <\u2032 is also determined by a rank kM\u2032 on ordinals. Define further ModKB (M) = {M\u2032 | M\u2032 |= KB and M\u2032 \u2248 M}. Let us define finally Mmin = \u3008\u2206,<min, Imin\u3009, where Imin = I and <min is defined by the ranking, for any x \u2208 \u2206:\nkmin(x) = min{kM\u2032(x) | M\u2032 \u2208 ModKB (M)}\nObserve that kmin(x) is well-defined for any concept C and\nkMmin(C) = min{kmin(x) | x \u2208 C Imin}\nis also well-defined (a set of ordinals has always a least element). We now show that Mmin |= KB. Since I is the same as in M, it follows immediately that M |= KF .\nWe prove that M |= KD. Let T(C) \u2291 E \u2208 FD . Suppose by absurdity that Mmin 6|= T(C) \u2291 E, this means that kmin(C \u2293 \u00acE) \u2264 kmin(C \u2293 E). Let M1 \u2208 ModKB(M), such that kmin(C \u2293 \u00acE) = kM1(C \u2293 \u00acE). M1 exists. Similarly, let M2 \u2208 ModKB(M), such that kmin(C \u2293E) = kM2(C \u2293E). We then have kM1(C \u2293 \u00acE) = kmin(C\u2293\u00acE) \u2264 kmin(C\u2293E) = kM2(C\u2293E) \u2264 kM1(C\u2293E), as kM2(C\u2293E) is minimal. Thus we get that kM1(C \u2293 \u00acE) \u2264 kM1(C \u2293 E) against the fact that M1 is a model of KB.\nThe following theorem says that reasoning in SHIQRT has the same complexity as reasoning in SHIQ, i.e. it is in EXPTIME. Its proof is given by providing an encoding of satisfiability in SHIQRT into satisfiability SHIQ, which is known to be an EXPTIME-complete problem.\nTheorem 1. Satisfiability in SHIQRT is an EXPTIME-complete problem.\nThe proof can be found in Appendix A.\n3 Rational Closure for SHIQ\nIn this section, we extend to SHIQ the notion of rational closure proposed by Lehmann and Magidor [23] for the propositional case. Given the typicality operator, the typicality inclusionsT(C) \u2291 D (all the typicalC\u2019s are D\u2019s) play the role of conditional assertions C |\u223c D in [23]. Here we define the rational closure of the TBox. In Section 6 we will discuss an extension of rational closure that also takes into account the ABox.\nDefinition 6 (Exceptionality of concepts and inclusions). Let TB be a TBox and C a concept. C is said to be exceptional for TB if and only if TB |=SHIQRT T(\u22a4) \u2291 \u00acC. A T-inclusion T(C) \u2291 D is exceptional for TB if C is exceptional for TB . The set of T-inclusions of TB which are exceptional in TB will be denoted as E(TB).\nGiven a DL KB=(TBox,ABox), it is possible to define a sequence of non increasing subsets of TBox E0 \u2287 E1, E1 \u2287 E2, . . . by letting E0 = TBox and, for i > 0, Ei = E(Ei\u22121) \u222a {C \u2291 D \u2208 TBox s.t. T does not occurr in C}. Observe that, being KB finite, there is an n \u2265 0 such that, for all m > n,Em = En or Em = \u2205. Observe also that the definition of the Ei\u2019s is the same as the definition of the Ci\u2019s in Lehmann and Magidor\u2019s rational closure [21], except for that here, at each step, we also add all the \u201cstrict\u201d inclusions C \u2291 D (where T does not occur in C).\nDefinition 7 (Rank of a concept). A concept C has rank i (denoted by rank(C) = i) for KB=(TBox,ABox), iff i is the least natural number for which C is not exceptional for Ei. If C is exceptional for all Ei then rank(C) = \u221e, and we say that C has no rank.\nThe notion of rank of a formula allows to define the rational closure of the TBox of a KB. Let |=SHIQ be the entailment in SHIQ. In the following definition, by KB |=SHIQ F we mean KF |=SHIQ F , where KF does not include the defeasible inclusions in KB.\nDefinition 8 (Rational closure of TBox). Let KB=(TBox,ABox) be a DL knowledge base. We define, TBox , the rational closure of TBox, as TBox = {T(C) \u2291 D | either rank(C) < rank(C \u2293\u00acD) or rank(C) = \u221e} \u222a {C \u2291 D | KB |=SHIQ C \u2291 D}, where C and D are arbitrary SHIQ concepts.\nObserve that, apart form the addition of strict inclusions, the above definition of rational closure is the same as the one by Lehmann and Magidor in [23]. The rational closure of TBox is a nonmonotonic strengthening of SHIQRT. For instance, it allows to deal with irrelevance, as the following example shows.\nExample 1. Let TBox = {T(Actor) \u2291 Charming}. It can be verified that T(Actor \u2293 Comic) \u2291 Charming \u2208 TBox . This is a nonmonotonic inference that does no longer follow if we discover that indeed comic actors are not charming (and in this respect are untypical actors): indeed given TBox\u2019= TBox \u222a {T(Actor \u2293Comic) \u2291 \u00acCharming}, we have that T(Actor \u2293 Comic) \u2291 Charming 6\u2208 TBox \u2032. Furthermore, as for the propositional case, rational closure is closed under rational monotonicity [21]: from T(Actor) \u2291 Charming \u2208 TBox and T(Actor) \u2291 Bold 6\u2208 TBox it follows that T(Actor \u2293 \u00acBold ) \u2291 Charming \u2208 TBox .\nAlthough the rational closure TBox is an infinite set, its definition is based on the construction of a finite sequence E0, E1, . . . , En of subsets of TBox, and the problem of verifying that an inclusion T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 TBox is in EXPTIME. To prove this result we need to introduce some propositions.\nFirst of all, let us remember that rational entailment is equivalent to preferential entailment for a knowledge base only containing positive non-monotonic implications A |\u223c B (see [23]). The same holds in preferential description logics with typicality. Let\nSHIQPT be the logic that we obtain when we remove the requirement of modularity in the definition of SHIQRT. In this logic the typicality operator has a preferential semantics [21], based on the preferential models of P rather then on the ranked models [23]. An extension of ALC with typicality based on preferential logic P has been studied in [14]. As a TBox of a KB in SHIQRT is a set of strict inclusions and defeasible inclusions (i.e., positive non-monotonic implications), it can be proved that:\nProposition 4. Given a KB with empty ABox, and an inclusion E \u2291 D we have\nKB |=SHIQRT E \u2291 D iff KB |=SHIQPT E \u2291 D\nProof. (sketch) The (if) direction is trivial, thus we consider the (only if) one. Suppose that KB 6|=SHIQPT E \u2291 D, let M = \u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 a preferential model of KB, where < is transitive, irreflexive, and well-founded, which falsifies E \u2291 D. Then for some element x \u2208 E and x 6\u2208 D. Define first a model M1 = \u3008W , <1, I\u3009, where the relation <1 is defined as follows:\n<1=< \u222a {(u, v) | (u = x \u2228 u < x) \u2227 v 6= x \u2227 v 6< x}\nIt can be proved that:\n1. <1 is transitive and irreflexive 2. <1 is well-founded 3. if u < v then u <1 v 4. if u <1 x then u < x.\nWe can show that M1 is a model of KB. This is obvious for inclusions that do not involve T, as the interpretation I is the same. Given an inclusion T(G) \u2291 F \u2208 KB, if it holds in M then it holds also in M1 as Min M1 <1 (G) \u2286 Min M < (G). Moreover M1 falsifies E \u2291 D by x, in particular (the only interesting case) when E = T(C). To this regard, we know that x 6\u2208 DM1 , suppose by absurd that x 6\u2208 (T(C))M1 , since x \u2208 (T(C))M, we have that x \u2208 CM = CM1 , thus there must be a y <1 x with y \u2208 CM1 = CM. But then by 4 y < x and we get a contradiction. Thus x \u2208 (T(C))M1 and x 6\u2208 DM1 , that is x falsifies E \u2291 D in M1. Observe that <1 in model M1 satisfies:\n(\u2217) \u2200z 6= x (z <1 x \u2228 x <1 z)\nAs a next step we define a modular model M2 = \u3008W , <2, I\u3009, where the relation <2 is defined as follows. Considering M1 where <1 is well-founded, we can define by recursion the following function k from M to ordinals:\n\u2013 k(u) = 0 if u is minimal in M1 \u2013 k(u) = max{k(y) | y <1 u}+ 1 if the set {y | y <1 u} is finite \u2013 k(u) = sup{k(y) | y <1 u} if the set {y | y <1 u} is infinite.\nObserve that if u <1 v then k(u) < k(v). We now define:\nu <2 v iff k(u) < k(v)\nNotice that <2 is clearly transitive, modular, and well-founded; moreover u <1 v implies u <2 v. We can prove as before that M2 is a model of KB and that it falsifies E \u2291 D by x. For the latter, we consider again the only interesting case when E = T(C). Suppose by absurd that x 6\u2208 (T(C))M2 , since x \u2208 (T(C))M1 , we have that x \u2208 CM2 = CM1 , thus there must be a y <2 x with y \u2208 CM2 = CM1 . But y <2 x means that k(y) < k(x). We can conclude that it must be also y <1 x, otherwise by (*) we would have x <1 y which entails k(x) < k(y), a contradiction. We have shown that y <1 x, thus x 6\u2208 (T(C))M1 a contradiction. Therefore x \u2208 (T(C))M2 and x 6\u2208 DM2 , that is x falsifies E \u2291 D in M2. We have shown that KB 6|=SHIQRT E \u2291 D.\nThe proof above also extends to a KB with a non-empty ABox, but it must not contain positive typicality assertions on individuals.\nProposition 5. Let KB=(TBox,\u2205) be a knowledge base with empty ABox.KB |=SHIQRT CL \u2291 CR iff KB\u2032 |=SHIQ C\u2032L \u2291 C \u2032 R, where KB \u2032, C\u2032L and C \u2032 R are polynomial encodings in SHIQ of KB, CL and CR, respectively.\nProof. By Proposition 4, we have that\nKB |=SHIQRT CL \u2291 CR iff KB |=SHIQPT CL \u2291 CR\nwhere CL \u2291 CR is any (strict or defeasible) inclusion in SHIQ R T.\nTo prove the thesis it suffices to show that for all inclusions CL \u2291 CR in SHIQ R T:\nKB |=SHIQPT CL \u2291 CR iff KB \u2032 |=SHIQ C\u2032L \u2291 C \u2032 R\nfor some polynomial encoding KB\u2032, C\u2032L and C \u2032 R in SHIQ.\nThe idea, on which the encoding is based, exploits the definition of the typicality operator T introduced in [14], in terms of a Go\u0308del-Lo\u0308b modality \u2737 as follows: T(C) is defined as C\u2293\u2737\u00acC where the accessibility relation of the modality \u2737 is the preference relation < in preferential models.\nWe define the encoding KB\u2019=(TBox\u2019, ABox\u2019) of KB in SHIQ as follows. First, ABox\u2019=\u2205.\nFor each A \u2291 B \u2208 TBox, not containing T, we introduce A \u2291 B in TBox\u2019. For each T(A) occurring in the TBox, we introduce a new atomic concept\u2737\u00acA and,\nfor each inclusion T(A) \u2291 B \u2208 TBox, we add to TBox\u2019 the inclusion\nA \u2293 \u2737\u00acA \u2291 B\nFurthermore, to capture the properties of the \u2737 modality, a new role R is introduced to represent the relation < in preferential models, and the following inclusions are introduced in TBox\u2019:\n\u2737\u00acA \u2291 \u2200R.(\u00acA \u2293 \u2737\u00acA) \u00ac\u2737\u00acA \u2291 \u2203R.(A \u2293 \u2737\u00acA)\nThe first inclusion accounts for the transitivity of <. The second inclusion accounts for the smoothness (see [23, 14]): the fact that if an element is not a typical A element then there must be a typical A element preferred to it.\nFor the encoding of the inclusion CL \u2291 CR: if CL \u2291 CR is a strict inclusion in SHIQRT, then C\u2032L = CL and C \u2032 R = CR; if CL \u2291 CR is a defeasible inclusion in SHIQRT, i.e. CL = T(A), then, we define C\u2032L = A \u2293 \u2737\u00acA and C \u2032 R = CR.\nIt is clear that the size of KB\u2019 is polynomial in the size of the KB (and the same holds for C\u2032L and C \u2032 R, assuming the size of CL and CR polynomial in the size of the KB). Given the above encoding, we can prove that:\nKB |=SHIQPT CL \u2291 CR iff KB \u2032 |=SHIQ C\u2032L \u2291 C \u2032 R\n(If) By contraposition, let us assume that KB 6|=SHIQPT CL \u2291 CR. We want to prove that KB\u2032 6|=SHIQ C\u2032L \u2291 C \u2032 R. From the hypothesis, there is a preferential model M = (\u2206,<, I) satisfying KB such that for some element x \u2208 \u2206, x \u2208 (CL)I and x \u2208 (\u00acCR) I . We build a SHIQ model M\u2032 = (\u2206\u2032, I \u2032) satisfying KB\u2019 as follows:\n\u2206\u2032 = \u2206; CI \u2032\n= CI , for all concepts C in the language of SHIQ; RI = RI \u2032\n, for all roles R; (x, y) \u2208 RI \u2032 if and only if y < x in the model M.\nBy construction it follows that T(A)I = (A \u2293 \u2737\u00acA)I \u2032\n. Also, it can be easily verified that M satisfies all the inclusions in KB\u2019 and that x \u2208 (C\u2032L) I\u2032 and x \u2208 (\u00acC\u2032R) I\u2032 . Hence KB\u2032 6|=SHIQ C \u2032 L \u2291 C \u2032 R.\n(Only if) By contraposition, let us assume that KB\u2032 6|=SHIQ C\u2032L \u2291 C \u2032 R. We want to prove that KB 6|=SHIQPT CL \u2291 CR. From the hypothesis, we know there is a model M\u2032 = (\u2206\u2032, I \u2032) satisfying KB\u2019, such that x \u2208 (C\u2032L) I\u2032 and x \u2208 (\u00acC\u2032R) I\u2032 . We build a model M = (\u2206,<, I) satisfying KB such that some element of M does not satisfy the inclusion CL \u2291 CR. We let:\n\u2206 = \u2206\u2032; CI = CI \u2032\n, for all concepts C in the language of SHIQ; RI = RI \u2032\n, for all roles R; y < x if and only if (x, y) \u2208 (RI \u2032 )\u2217 (the transitive closure of RI \u2032 ).\nBy construction, it is easy to show that T(A)I = (A\u2293\u2737\u00acA)I \u2032\nand we can easily verify that M satisfies all the inclusions in KB and that x \u2208 (CL)I and x \u2208 (\u00acCR)I .\nThe relation < is transitive, as it is defined as the transitive closure of R, but < is not guaranteed to be well-founded. However, we can modify the relation < in M to make it well-founded, by shortening the descending chains.\nFor any y \u2208 \u2206, we let \u2737y = {\u2737C | y \u2208 (\u2737C)I}. Observe that for the elements xi in a descending chain . . . , xi\u22121, xi, xi+1, . . ., the set \u2737xi is monotonically increasing (i.e., \u2737xi \u2286 \u2737xi+1).\nWe define a new model M\u2032\u2032 = (\u2206,<\u2032\u2032, I) by changing the preference relation < in M to <\u2032\u2032 as follows:\ny <\u2032\u2032 x iff (y < x and \u2737x \u2282 \u2737y) or (y < x and \u2737x = \u2737y and \u2200w \u2208 \u2206 such that x < w, \u2737w \u2282 \u2737x)\nIn essence, for a pair of elements (x, y) such that y < x but x and y are instances of exactly the same boxed concepts (\u2737x = \u2737y) and x is not the first element in the descending chain which is instance of all the boxed concepts in \u2737x, we do not include the pair (x, y) in <\u2032\u2032 (so that x and y will not be comparable in the pre-order <\u2032\u2032). The relation <\u2032\u2032 is transitive and well-founded. M\u2032\u2032 can be shown to be a model of KB, and x to be an instance of CL but not of CR. Hence, KB 6|=SHIQPT CL \u2291 CR.\nTheorem 2 (Complexity of rational closure over TBox). Given a TBox, the problem of deciding whether T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 TBox is in EXPTIME.\nProof. Checking if T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 TBox can be done by computing the finite sequence E0, E1, . . . , En of non increasing subsets of TBox inclusions in the construction of the rational closure. Note that the number n of the Ei is O(|KB|), where |KB| is the size of the knowledge base KB. Computing each Ei = E(Ei\u22121), requires to check, for all concepts A occurring on the left hand side of an inclusion in the TBox, whether Ei\u22121 |=SHIQRT T(\u22a4) \u2291 \u00acA. RegardingEi\u22121 as a knowledge base with empty ABox, by Proposition 5 it is enough to check that E\u2032i\u22121 |=SHIQ \u22a4 \u2294 \u2737\u00ac\u22a4 \u2291 \u00acA, which requires an exponential time in the size of E\u2032i\u22121 (and hence in the size of KB). If not already checked, the exceptionality of C and of C\u2293\u00acD have to be checked for each Ei, to determine the ranks of C and of C \u2293 \u00acD (which also can be computed in SHIQ and requires an exponential time in the size of KB). Hence, verifying if T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 TBox is in EXPTIME. \u2737\nThe above proof provides an EXPTIME complexity upper bound for computing the rational closure over a TBox in SHIQ and shows that the rational closure of a TBox can be computed simply using the entailment in SHIQ."}, {"heading": "4 Infinite Minimal Models with finite ranks", "text": "In the following we provide a characterization of minimal models of a KB in terms of their rank: intuitively minimal models are exactly those ones where each domain element has rank 0 if it satisfies all defeasible inclusions, and otherwise has the smallest rank greater than the rank of any concept C occurring in a defeasible inclusion T(C) \u2291 D of the KB falsified by the element. Exploiting this intuitive characterization of minimal models, we are able to show that, for a finite KB, minimal models have always a finite ranking function, no matter whether they have a finite domain or not. This result allows us to provide a semantic characterization of rational closure of the previous section to logics, like SHIQ, that do not have the finite model property.\nGiven a model M = \u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009, let us define the set SMx of defeasible inclusions falsified by a domain element x \u2208 \u2206, as SMx = {T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 KD | x \u2208 (C \u2293 \u00acD)I}}.\nProposition 6. Let M = \u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 be a model of KB and x \u2208 \u2206, then: (a) if kM(x) = 0 then SMx = \u2205; (b) if S M x 6= \u2205 then kM(x) > kM(C) for every C such that, for some D, T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 SMx .\nProof. Observe that (a) follows from (b). Let us prove (b). Suppose for a contradiction that (b) is false, so that SMx 6= \u2205 and for some C such that, for some D, T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 SMx , we have kM(x) \u2264 kM(C). We have also that x \u2208 (C \u2293 \u00acD)\nI . But M |= KB, in particular M |= T(C) \u2291 D, thus it must be x 6\u2208 (T(C))I , but x \u2208 CI , so that we get that kM(x) > kM(C) a contradiction. \u2737\nProposition 7. Let KB = KF \u222aKD and M = \u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 be a model of KF ; suppose that for any x \u2208 \u2206 it holds:\n\u2013 (a) if kM(x) = 0 then SMx = \u2205 \u2013 (b) if SMx 6= \u2205 then kM(x) > kM(C) for every C such that, for some D, T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 SMx .\nthen M |= KB.\nProof. Let T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 KD, suppose that for some x \u2208 C, it holds x \u2208 (T(C))I \u2212 DI , then T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 SMx . By hypothesis, we have kM(x) > kM(C), against the fact that x \u2208 T(C). \u2737\nProposition 8. Let KB = KF \u222aKD and M = \u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 a minimal model of KB, for every x \u2208 \u2206, it holds:\n\u2013 (a) if SMx = \u2205 then kM(x) = 0 \u2013 (b) if SMx 6= \u2205 then kM(x) = 1 +max{kM(C)s.t.T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 S M x }.\nProof. Let M = \u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 be a minimal model of KB. Define another model M\u2032 = \u3008\u2206,<\u2032, I\u3009, where <\u2032 is determined by a ranking function kM\u2032 as follows:\n\u2013 kM\u2032(x) = 0 if SMx = \u2205, \u2013 kM\u2032(x) = 1 +max{kM(C) | T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 SMx } if S M x 6= \u2205.\nIt is easy to see that (i) for every x kM\u2032(x) \u2264 kM(x). Indeed, if SMx = \u2205 then it is obvious; if SMx 6= \u2205, then kM\u2032(x) = 1+max{kM(C) | T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 S M x } \u2264 kM(x) by Proposition 6. It equally follows that (ii) for every concept C, kM\u2032(C) \u2264 kM(C). To see this: let z \u2208 CI such that kM(z) = kM(C), either kM\u2032(C) = kM\u2032(z) \u2264 kM(z) and we are done, or there exists y \u2208 CI , such that kM\u2032(C) = kM\u2032(y) < kM\u2032(z) \u2264 kM(z).\nObserve that SMx = S M\u2032\nx , since the evaluation function I is the same in the two models. By definition of M\u2032, we have M\u2032 |= KF ; moreover by (i) and (ii) it follows that:\n(iii) if kM\u2032(x) = 0 then SM \u2032\nx = \u2205. (iv) if SM \u2032\nx 6= \u2205: kM\u2032(x) = 1 + max{kM(C) | T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 S M x } \u2265 1 +\nmax{kM\u2032(C) | T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 S M\u2032\nx }, that is kM\u2032(x) > kM\u2032(C) for every C such that for some D, T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 SM \u2032\nx . By Proposition 7 we obtain that M\u2032 |= KB; but by (i) kM\u2032(x) \u2264 kM(x) and by hypothesis M is minimal. Thus it must be that for every x \u2208 \u2206, kM\u2032(x) = kM(x) (whence kM\u2032(C) = kM(C)) which entails that M satisfies (a) and (b) in the statement of the theorem. \u2737\nAlso the opposite direction holds:\nProposition 9. Let KB = KF \u222aKD, let M = \u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 be a model of KF , suppose that for every x \u2208 \u2206, it holds:\n\u2013 (a) SMx = \u2205 iff kM(x) = 0 \u2013 (b) if SMx 6= \u2205 then kM(x) = 1 +max{kM(C) | T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 S M x }.\nthen M is a minimal model of KB.\nProof. In light of previous Propositions 6 and 7, it is sufficient to show that M is minimal. To this aim, let M\u2032 = \u3008\u2206,<\u2032, I\u3009, with associated ranking function kM\u2032 , be another model of KB, we show that for every x \u2208 \u2206, it holds kM(x) \u2264 kM\u2032(x). We proceed by induction on kM\u2032(x). If SMx = S M\u2032\nx = \u2205, we have that kM(x) = 0 \u2264 kM\u2032(x) (no need of induction). If SMx = S M\u2032 x 6= \u2205, then since M \u2032 |= KB, by Proposition 6: kM\u2032(x) \u2265 1 + max{kM\u2032(C) | T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 SM \u2032 x }. Let S M\u2032\nx = SMx = {T(C1) \u2291 D1, . . . ,T(Cu) \u2291 Du}. For i = 1, . . . , u let kM\u2032(Ci) = kM\u2032(yi) for some yi \u2208 \u2206. Observe that kM\u2032(yi) < kM\u2032(x), thus by induction hypothesis kM(yi) \u2264 kM\u2032(yi), for i = 1, . . . , u. But then kM(Ci) \u2264 kM(yi), so that we finally get:\nkM\u2032(x) \u2265 1 +max{kM(C) | T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 S M\n\u2032\nx }\n= 1 +max{kM\u2032(C1), . . . , kM\u2032(Cu)}\n= 1 +max{kM\u2032(y1), . . . , kM\u2032(yu)}\n\u2265 1 +max{kM(y1), . . . , kM(yu)}\n\u2265 1 +max{kM(C1), . . . , kM(Cu)} = 1 +max{kM(C) | T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 S M x }\n= kM\u2032(x)\n\u2737\nPutting Propositions 8 and 9 together, we obtain the following theorem which provides a characterization of minimal models.\nTheorem 3. Let KB = KF \u222a KD, and let M = \u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 be a model of KF . The following are equivalent:\n\u2013 M is a minimal model of KB \u2013 For every x \u2208 \u2206 it holds: (a) SMx = \u2205 iff kM(x) = 0 (b) if S M x 6= \u2205 then\nkM(x) = 1 +max{kM(C) | T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 SMx }.\nThe following proposition shows that in any minimal model the rank of each domain element is finite.\nProposition 10. Let KB = KF \u222aKD and M = \u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 a minimal model of KB, for every x \u2208 \u2206, kM(x) is a finite ordinal (kM(x) < \u03c9).\nProof. Let kM(x) = \u03b1, we proceed by induction on \u03b1. If SMx = \u2205, then by Proposition 8 \u03b1 = 0 and we are done (no need of induction). Otherwise if SMx 6= \u2205, by Proposition 8, we have that kM(x) = \u03b1 = 1 + max{kM(C) | T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 SMx }. Let S M x = {T(C1) \u2291 D1, . . . ,T(Cu) \u2291 Du}. For i = 1, . . . , u let kM(Ci) = \u03b2i = kM(yi) for some yi \u2208 \u2206. So that we have kM(x) = \u03b1 = 1 + max{\u03b21, . . . , \u03b2u}. Since kM(yi) = \u03b2i < \u03b1, by induction hypothesis we have that \u03b2i < \u03c9, thus also \u03b1 < \u03c9. \u2737\nThe previous proposition is essential for establishing a correspondence between the minimal model semantics of a KB and its rational closure. From now on, we can assume that the ranking function assigns to each domain element in \u2206 a natural number, i.e. that kM : \u2206 \u2212\u2192 N.\n5 A Minimal Model Semantics for Rational Closure in SHIQ\nIn previous sections we have extended to SHIQ the syntactic notion of rational closure introduced in [23] for propositional logic. To provide a semantic characterization of this notion, we define a special class of minimal models, exploiting the fact that, by Proposition 10, in all minimal SHIQRT models the rank of each domain element is always finite. First of all, we can observe that the minimal model semantics in Definition 5 as it is cannot capture the rational closure of a TBox.\nConsider the following KB=(TBox,\u2205), where TBox contains:\nVIP \u2291 Person , T(Person) \u2291 \u2264 1 HasMarried .Person , T(VIP) \u2291 \u2265 2 HasMarried . Person .\nWe observe that T(VIP \u2293 Tall) \u2291 \u2265 2 HasMarried .Person does not hold in all minimal SHIQRT models of KB w.r.t. Definition 5. Indeed there can be a model M = \u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 in which \u2206 = {x, y, z}, VIPI = {x, y}, PersonI = {x, y, z}, (\u2264 1HasMarried .Person)I = {x, z}, (\u2265 2HasMarried .Person)I = {y}, Tall I = {x}, and z < y < x. M is a model of KB, and it is minimal. Also, x is a typical tallVIP in M (since there is no other tall VIP preferred to him) and has no more than one spouse, therefore T(VIP \u2293 Tall) \u2291 \u2265 2 HasMarried .Person does not hold in M. On the contrary, it can be verified that T(VIP \u2293 Tall) \u2291 \u2265 2 HasMarried .Person \u2208 TBox .\nThings change if we consider the minimal models semantics applied to models that contain a domain element for each combination of concepts consistent with KB. We call these models canonical models. Therefore, in order to semantically characterize the rational closure of a SHIQRT KB, we restrict our attention to minimal canonical models. First, we define S as the set of all the concepts (and subconcepts) not containing T, which occur in KB or in the query F , together with their complements.\nIn order to define canonical models, we consider all the sets of concepts {C1, C2, . . . , Cn} \u2286 S that are consistent with KB, i.e., s.t. KB 6|=SHIQRT C1 \u2293C2 \u2293 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2293Cn \u2291 \u22a5.\nDefinition 9 (Canonical model with respect to S). Given KB=(TBox,ABox) and a query F , a model M =\u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 satisfying KB is canonical with respect to S if it contains at least a domain element x \u2208 \u2206 s.t. x \u2208 (C1 \u2293 C2 \u2293 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2293Cn)I , for each set of concepts {C1, C2, . . . , Cn} \u2286 S that is consistent with KB.\nNext we define the notion of minimal canonical model.\nDefinition 10 (Minimal canonical models (w.r.t.S)).M is a minimal canonical model of KB if it satisfies KB, it is minimal (with respect to Definition 5) and it is canonical (as defined in Definition 9).\nProposition 11 (Existence of minimal canonical models). Let KB be a finite knowledge base, if KB is satisfiable then it has a minimal canonical model.\nProof. Let M = \u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 be a minimal model of KB (which exists by Proposition 3), and let {C1, C2, . . . , Cn} \u2286 S any subset of S consistent with KB.\nWe show that we can expand M in order to obtain a model of KB that contains an instance of C1 \u2293 C2 \u2293 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2293 Cn. By repeating the same construction for all maximal subsets {C1, C2, . . . , Cn} of S, we eventually obtain a canonical model of KB.\nFor each {C1, C2, . . . , Cn} consistent with KB, it holds that KB 6|=SHIQRT C1 \u2293 C2 \u2293 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2293 Cn \u2291 \u22a5, i.e. there is a model M\u2032 = \u3008\u2206\u2032, <\u2032, I \u2032\u3009 of KB that contains an instance of {C1, C2, . . . , Cn}.\nLet M \u2032\u2217 be the union of M and M\u2032, i.e. M \u2032\u2217 = \u3008\u2206 \u2032\u2217, < \u2032\u2217, I \u2032\u2217\u3009, where \u2206 \u2032\u2217 = \u2206 \u222a\u2206\u2217. As far as individuals named in the ABox, I\n\u2032\u2217 = I , whereas for the concepts and roles, I\n\u2032\u2217 = I on \u2206 and I \u2032\u2217 = I \u2032 on \u2206\u2032. Also, kM\u2032\u2217 = kM for the elements in \u2206,\nand kM\u2032\u2217 = kM\u2032 for the elements in \u2206 \u2032. < \u2032\u2217 is straightforwardly defined from kM\u2032\u2217 as described just before Definition 4.\nThe model M \u2032\u2217 is still a model of KB. For the set KF in the previous definition this is obviously true. For KD, for each T(C) \u2291 D in KD, if x \u2208 Min<\u2032\u2217(C) in M\u2032\u2217, also x \u2208 Min<(C) in M or x \u2208 Min<\u2032(C) in M\u2032. In both cases x is an instance of D (since both M and M\u2032 satisfy KD), therefore x \u2208 DI \u2032 \u2217 , and M \u2032\u2217 satisfies KD.\nBy repeating the same construction for all maximal subsets {C1, C2, . . . , Cn} of S, we obtain a canonical model of KB, call it M\u2217. We do not know whether the model is minimal. However by applying the construction used in the proof of Proposition 3, we obtain M\u2217min that is a minimal model of KB with the same domain and interpretation function than M\u2217. M\u2217min is therefore a canonical model of KB, and furthermore it is minimal. Therefore KB has a minimal canonical model.\nTo prove the correspondence between minimal canonical models and the rational closure of a TBox, we need to introduce some propositions. The next one concerns all SHIQRT models. Given a SHIQRT model M =\u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009, we define a sequence M0, M1,M2, . . . of models as follows: We let M0 = M and, for all i, we let Mi = \u3008\u2206,<i, I\u3009 be the SHIQ R T model obtained from M by assigning a rank 0 to all the domain elements x with kM(x) < i, i.e., kMi(x) = kM(x)\u2212 i if kM(x) > i, and kMi(x) = 0 otherwise. We can prove the following:\nProposition 12. Let KB= \u3008TBox,ABox\u3009 and let M =\u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 be any SHIQRT model of TBox. For any concept C, if rank(C) \u2265 i, then 1) kM(C) \u2265 i, and 2) if T(C) \u2291 D is entailed by Ei, then Mi satisfies T(C) \u2291 D.\nProof. By induction on i. For i = 0, 1) holds (since it always holds that kM(C) \u2265 0). 2) holds trivially as M0 = M.\nFor i > 0, 1) holds: if rank(C)\u2265 i, then, by Definition 7, for all j < i, we have that Ej |= T(\u22a4) \u2291 \u00acC. By inductive hypothesis on 2), for all j < i, Mj |= T(\u22a4) \u2291 \u00acC. Hence, for all x with kM(x) < i, x 6\u2208 CI , and kM(C) \u2265 i.\nTo prove 2), we reason as follows. Since Ei \u2286 E0, M |= Ei. Furthermore by definition of rank, for all T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 Ei, rank(C) \u2265 i, hence by 1) just proved kM(C) \u2265 i. Hence, in M, Min<(CI) \u2265 i, and also Mi |= T(C) \u2291 D. Therefore Mi |= Ei. \u2737\nLet us now focus our attention on minimal canonical models by proving the correspondence between rank of a formula (as in Definition 7) and rank of a formula in a model (as in Definition 4). The following proposition is proved by induction on the rank i:\nProposition 13. Given KB and S, for all C \u2208 S, if rank(C) = i, then: 1. there is a {C1 . . . Cn} \u2286 S maximal and consistent with KB such that C \u2208 {C1 . . . Cn} and rank(C1 \u2293 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2293 Cn) = i; 2. for any M minimal canonical model of KB, kM(C) = i.\nProof. By induction on i. Let us first consider the base case in which i = 0. We have that KB 6|=SHIQRT T(\u22a4) \u2291 \u00acC. Then there is a minimal model M1 of KB with a domain element x such that kM1(x) = 0 and x satisfies C. For 1): consider the maximal consistent set of concepts in S of which x is an instance in M1. This is a maximal consistent {C1 . . . Cn} \u2286 S containingC. Furthermore, rank(C1\u2293\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2293Cn) = 0 since clearly KB 6|=SHIQRT T(\u22a4) \u2291 \u00ac(C1 \u2293 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2293 Cn). For 2): by definition of canonical model, in any canonical model M of KB, {C1 . . . Cn} is satisfiable by an element x. Furthermore, in any minimal canonical M, kM(x) = 0, since otherwise we could build M\u2032 identical to M except from the fact that kM\u2032(x) = 0. It can be easily proven that M\u2032 would still be a model of KB (indeed {C1 . . . Cn} was already satisfiable in M1 by an element with rank 0) and M\u2032 <FIMS M, against the minimality of M. Therefore, in any minimal canonical model M of KB, it holds kM(C) = 0.\nFor the inductive step, consider the case in which i > 0. We have that Ei 6|=SHIQRT T(\u22a4) \u2291 \u00acC, then there must be a model M1 = \u3008\u22061, <1, I1\u3009 of Ei, and a domain element x such that kM1(x) = 0 and x satisfies C. Consider the maximal consistent set of concepts {C1, . . . Cn} \u2286 S of which x is an instance in M1. C \u2208 {C1, . . . Cn}. Furthermore, rank(C1 \u2293\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2293Cn) = i. Indeed Ei\u22121 |=SHIQRT T(\u22a4) \u2291 \u00ac(C1 \u2293\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2293 Cn) (since Ei\u22121 |=SHIQRT T(\u22a4) \u2291 \u00acC and C \u2208 {C1, . . . Cn}), whereas clearly by the existence of x, Ei 6|=SHIQRT T(\u22a4) \u2291 \u00ac(C1\u2293\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2293Cn). In order to prove 1) we are left to prove that the set {C1, . . . Cn} (that we will call \u0393 in the following) is consistent with KB.\nTo prove this, take any minimal canonical model M = \u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 of KB. By inductive hypothesis we know that for all concepts C\u2032 such that rank(C\u2032) < i, there is a maximal consistent set of concepts {C\u20321, . . . C \u2032 n} with C \u2032 \u2208 {C\u20321, . . . C \u2032 n} and rank(C\u20321 \u2293 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2293 C \u2032 n) = j < i. Furthermore, we know that kM(C\n\u2032) = j < i. For a contradiction, if M did not contain any element satisfying \u0393 we could expand it by adding to M a portion of the model M1 including x \u2208 \u22061. More precisely, we add to M a new set of domain elements \u2206x \u2286 \u22061, containing the domain element x of M1 and all the domain elements of \u22061 which are reachable from x in M1 through a sequence of relations RI1i s or (R \u2212 i )\nI1s. Let M\u2032 be the resulting model. We define I \u2032 on the elements of \u2206 as in M, while we define I \u2032 on the element of \u2206x as in I1. Finally, we let, for all w \u2208 \u2206, kM\u2032(w) = kM(w) and, for all y \u2208 \u2206x, kM\u2032(y) = i+kM1(y). In particular, kM\u2032(x) = i. The resulting model M\u2032 would still be a model of KB. Indeed, the ABox would still be satisfied by the resulting model (being the M part unchanged). For the TBox: all domain elements already in M still satisfy all the inclusions. For all y \u2208 \u2206x (including x): for all inclusions in Ei, y satisfies them (since it did it in M1); for all typicality inclusions T(D) \u2291 G \u2208 KB \u2212Ei, rank(D) < i, hence by inductive hypothesis kM(D) < i, hence kM\u2032(D) < i, and y is not a typical instance of D and\ntrivially satisfies the inclusion. It is easy to see that M\u2032 also satisfies role inclusions R \u2291 S and that, for each transitive roles R, RI \u2032\nis transitive. We have then built a model of KB satisfying \u0393 . Therefore \u0393 is consistent with KB, and therefore by definition of canonical model, \u0393 must be satisfiable in M. Up to now we have proven that \u0393 is maximal and consistent with KB, it contains C and has rank i, therefore point 1) holds.\nIn order to prove point 2) we need to prove that any minimal canonical model M of KB not only satisfies \u0393 but it satisfies it with rank i, i.e. kM(C1 \u2293 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2293 Cn) = i, which entails kM(C) = i (since C \u2208 {C1, . . . Cn}). By Proposition 12 we know that kM(C1 \u2293 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2293Cn) \u2265 i. We need to show that also kM(C1 \u2293 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2293Cn) \u2264 i. We reason as above: for a contradiction suppose kM(C1 \u2293 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2293 Cn) > i, i.e., for all the minimal domain elements y instances of C1\u2293\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2293Cn, kM(y) > i. We show that this contradicts the minimality of M. Indeed consider M\u2032 obtained from M by letting kM\u2032(y) = i, for some minimal domain element y instance of C1 \u2293 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2293 Cn, and leaving all the rest unchanged. M\u2032 would still be a model of KB: the only thing that changes with respect to M is that y might have become in M\u2032 a minimal instance of a concept of which it was only a non-typical instance in M. This might compromise the satisfaction in M of a typical inclusion as T(E) \u2291 G. However: if rank(E) < i, we know by inductive hypothesis that kM(E) < i hence also kM\u2032(E) < i and y is not a minimal instance of E in M\u2032. If rank(E) \u2265 i, then T(E) \u2291 G \u2208 Ei. As y \u2208 C1 \u2293 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2293 Cn (where {C1, . . . Cn} is maximal consistent with KB), we have that: y \u2208 F I iff x \u2208 F I1 , for all concepts F . If y \u2208 EI , then E \u2208 {C1, . . . Cn}. Hence, in M1, x \u2208 EI1 . But M1 is a model of Ei, and satisfies all the inclusions in Ei. Therefore x \u2208 GI1 and, thus, y \u2208 GI .\nIt follows that M\u2032 would be a model of KB, and M\u2032<FIMS M, against the minimality of M. We are therefore forced to conclude that kM(C1 \u2293 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2293 Cn) = i, and hence also kM(C) = i, and 2) holds. \u2737\nThe following theorem follows from the propositions above:\nTheorem 4. Let KB=(TBox,ABox) be a knowledge base and C \u2291 D a query. We have that C \u2291 D \u2208 TBox if and only if C \u2291 D holds in all minimal canonical models of"}, {"heading": "KB with respect to S.", "text": "Proof. (Only if part) Assume that C \u2291 D holds in all minimal canonical models of KB with respect to S, and let M =\u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 be a minimal canonical model of KB satisfying C \u2291 D. Observe that C and D (and their complements) belong to S. We consider two cases: (1) the left end side of the inclusion C does not contain the typicality operator, and (2) the left end side of the inclusion is T(C).\nIn case (1), if the minimal canonical model M of KB satisfies C \u2291 D. Then, CI \u2286 DI . For a contradiction, let us assume that C \u2291 D 6\u2208 TBox . Then, by definition of TBox , it must be: KB 6|=SHIQ C \u2291 D. Hence, KB 6|=SHIQ C \u2293 \u00acD \u2291 \u22a5, and the set of concepts {C,\u00acD} is consistent with KB. As M is a canonical model of KB, there must be a element x \u2208 \u2206 such that x \u2208 (C \u2293 \u00acD)I . This contradicts the fact that CI \u2286 DI .\nIn case (2), assume M satisfies T(C) \u2291 D. Then, T(C)I \u2286 DI , i.e., for each x \u2208 Min<(CI), x \u2208 DI . If Min<(CI) = \u2205, then there is no x \u2208 CI (by the\nsmoothness condition), hence C has no rank in M and, by Proposition 13, C has no rank (rank(C) = \u221e). In this case, by Definition 8, T(C) \u2291 D \u2208 TBox . Otherwise, let us assume that kM(C) = i. As kM(C \u2293D) < kM(C \u2293 \u00acD), then kM(C \u2293 \u00acD) > i.

Let M be any minimal canonical model of KB. In the case (a), by Proposition 13, kM(C) < kM(C \u2293 \u00acD), which entails kM(C \u2293D) < kM(C \u2293 \u00acD). Hence M satisfies T(C) \u2291 D. In case (b), by Proposition 13, C has no rank in M, hence M satisfies T(C) \u2291 D. \u2737"}, {"heading": "6 Rational Closure over the ABox", "text": "The definition of rational closure in Section 3 takes only into account the TBox. We address the issue of ABox reasoning first by the semantical side: as for any domain element, we would like to attribute to each individual constant named in the ABox the lowest possible rank. Therefore we further refine Definition 10 of minimal canonical models with respect to TBox by taking into account the interpretation of individual constants of the ABox.\nDefinition 11 (Minimal canonical model w.r.t. ABox). Given KB=(TBox,ABox), let M =\u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 and M\u2032 = \u3008\u2206\u2032, <\u2032, I \u2032\u3009 be two canonical models of KB which are minimal w.r.t. Definition 10. We say that M is preferred to M\u2032 w.r.t. ABox (M <ABox M\u2032) if, for all individual constants a occurring in ABox, kM(aI) \u2264 kM\u2032(aI \u2032\n) and there is at least one individual constant b occurring in ABox such that kM(bI) < kM\u2032(bI \u2032 ).\nAs a consequence of Proposition 11 we can prove that:\nTheorem 5. For any KB= (TBox,ABox) there exists a minimal canonical model of KB with respect to ABox.\nIn order to see the strength of the above semantics, consider our example about marriages and VIPs.\nExample 2. Suppose we have a KB=(TBox,ABox) where: TBox={T(Person) \u2291 \u2264 1 HasMarried .Person , T(VIP ) \u2291 \u2265 2 HasMarried .Person , VIP \u2291 Person}, and ABox = {VIP(demi),Person(marco)}. Knowing that Marco is a person and Demi is a VIP, we would like to be able to assume, in the absence of other information, that Marco is a typical person, whereas Demi is a typical VIP, and therefore Marco has at most one spouse, whereas Demi has at least two. Consider any minimal canonical model M of KB. Being canonical, M will contain, among other elements, the following: x \u2208 (Person)I , x \u2208 (\u2264 1 HasMarried .Person)I , x \u2208 (\u00acVIP)I , kM(x) = 0; y \u2208 (Person)I , y \u2208 (\u2265 2 HasMarried .Person)I , y \u2208 (\u00acVIP)I , kM(y) = 1; z \u2208 (VIP)I , z \u2208 (Person)I , z \u2208 (\u2265 2 HasMarried .Person)I , kM(z) = 1; w \u2208 (VIP)I , w \u2208 (Person)I , w \u2208 (\u2264 1 HasMarried .Person)I , kM(w) = 2.\nso that x is a typical person and z is a typical VIP. Notice that in the definition of minimal canonical model there is no constraint on the interpretation of constants marco\nand demi . As far as Definition 10 is concerned, for instance, marco can be mapped onto x ((marco)I = x) or onto y ((marco)I = y): the minimality of M w.r.t. Definition 10 is not affected by this choice. However in the first case it would hold that Marco is a typical person, in the second Marco is not a typical person. According to Definition 11, we prefer the first case, and there is a unique minimal canonical model w.r.t. ABox in which (marco)I = x and (demi)I = z.\nWe next provide an algorithmic construction for the rational closure of ABox. The idea is that of considering all the possible minimal consistent assignments of ranks to the individuals explicitly named in the ABox. Each assignment adds some properties to named individuals which can be used to infer new conclusions. We adopt a skeptical view by considering only those conclusions which hold for all assignments. The equivalence with the semantics shows that the minimal entailment captures a skeptical approach when reasoning about the ABox. More formally, in order to calculate the rational closure of ABox, written ABox , for all individual constants of the ABox we find out which is the lowest possible rank they can have in minimal canonical models with respect to Definition 10: the idea is that an individual constant ai can have a given rank kj(ai) just in case it is compatible with all the inclusions T(A) \u2291 D of the TBox whose antecedent A\u2019s rank is \u2265 kj(ai) (the inclusions whose antecedent A\u2019s rank is < kj(ai) do not matter since, in the canonical model, there will be an instance of A with rank < kj(ai) and therefore ai will not be a typical instance of A). The algorithm below computes all minimal rank assignments kjs to all individual constants: \u00b5 j i contains all the concepts that ai would need to satisfy in case it had the rank attributed by kj (kj(ai)). The algorithm verifies whether \u00b5j is compatible with (TBox , ABox) and whether it is minimal. Notice that, in this phase, all constants are considered simultaneously (indeed, the possible ranks of different individual constants depend on each other). For this reason \u00b5j takes into account the ranks attributed to all individual constants, being the union of all \u00b5ji for all ai, and the consistency of this union with (TBox , ABox) is verified.\nDefinition 12 (ABox : rational closure of ABox). Let a1, . . . , am be the individuals explicitly named in the ABox. Let k1, k2, . . . , kh be all the possible rank assignments (ranging from 1 to n) to the individuals occurring in ABox. \u2013 Given a rank assignment kj we define:\n\u2013 for each ai: \u00b5 j i = {(\u00acC \u2294 D)(ai) s.t. C,D \u2208 S, T(C) \u2291 D in TBox , and\nkj(ai) \u2264 rank(C)} \u222a {(\u00acC \u2294D)(ai) s.t. C \u2291 D in TBox };\n\u2013 let \u00b5j = \u00b5j1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a\u00b5 j m for all \u00b5 j 1 . . . \u00b5 j m just calculated for all a1, . . . , am in ABox\n\u2013 kj is minimal and consistent with (TBox , ABox), i.e.: (i) TBox \u222a ABox \u222a\u00b5j is consistent in SHIQRT; (ii) there is no ki consistent with (TBox , ABox) s.t. for all ai, ki(ai) \u2264 kj(ai) and for some b, ki(b) < kj(b). \u2013 The rational closure of ABox ( ABox ) is the set of all assertions derivable in SHIQRT from TBox \u222a ABox \u222a\u00b5j for all minimal consistent rank assignments kj , i.e:\nABox = \u22c2\nkjminimal consistent {C(a) : TBox \u222a ABox \u222a \u00b5j |=SHIQRT C(a)}\nThe example below is the syntactic counterpart of the semantic Example 2 above.\nExample 3. Consider the KB in Example 2. Computing the ranking of concepts we get that rank(Person) = 0, rank(VIP) = 1, rank(Person \u2293 \u2265 2HasMarried .Person) = 1, rank(VIP \u2293 \u2264 1 HasMarried .Person) = 2. It is easy to see that a rank assignment k0 with k0(demi) = 0 is inconsistent with KB as \u00b50 would contain (\u00acVIP \u2294 Person)(demi), (\u00acPerson \u2294 \u2264 1HasMarried .Person)(demi), (\u00acVIP\u2294 \u2265 2HasMarried . Person)(demi) and VIP(demi). Thus we are left with only two ranks k1 and k2 with respectively k1(demi) = 1, k1(marco) = 0 and k2(demi) = k2(marco) = 1.\nThe set \u00b51 contains, among the others, (\u00acVIP \u2294 \u2265 2HasMarried .Person)(demi) , (\u00acPerson \u2294 \u2264 1 HasMarried .Person)(marco). It is tedious but easy to check that KB \u222a\u00b51 is consistent and that k1 is the only minimal consistent assignment (being k1 preferred to k2), thus both (\u2265 2HasMarried .Person)(demi) and (\u2264 1HasMarried .Person) (marco) belong to ABox .\nWe are now ready to show the soundness and completeness of the algorithm with respect to the semantic definition of rational closure of ABox.\nTheorem 6 (Soundness of ABox ). Given KB=(TBox, ABox), for each individual constant a in ABox, we have that if C(a) \u2208ABox then C(a) holds in all minimal canonical models with respect to ABox of KB.\nProof (Sketch). Let C(a) \u2208 ABox , and suppose for a contradiction that there is a minimal canonical model M with respect to ABox of KB s.t. C(a) does not hold in M. Consider now the rank assignment kj corresponding toM (such that kj(ai) = kM(ai)). By hypothesis M |= TBox \u222a ABox. Furthermore it can be easily shown that M |= \u00b5j .\nSince by hypothesis M6|= C(a), it follows that TBox \u222a ABox \u222a \u00b5j 6|=SHIQRT C(a), and by definition of ABox , C(a) 6\u2208 ABox , against the hypothesis. \u2737\nTheorem 7 (Completeness ofABox ). Given KB=(TBox, ABox), for all individual constant a in ABox, we have that if C(a) holds in all minimal canonical models with respect to ABox of KB, then C(a) \u2208 ABox .\nProof (Sketch). We show the contrapositive. Suppose C(a) 6\u2208 ABox , i.e. there is a minimal kj consistent with (TBox , ABox) s.t. TBox \u222a ABox \u222a\u00b5j 6|=SHIQRT C(a). This means that there is an M\u2032 = \u3008\u2206\u2032, <, I \u2032\u3009 such that for all ai \u2208 ABox, kM\u2032(ai) = kj(ai), M\u2032|= TBox \u222a ABox \u222a\u00b5j and M\u2032 6|= C(a). From M\u2032 we build a minimal canonical model with respect to ABox M =\u3008\u2206,<, I\u3009 of KB, such that C(ai) does not hold in M.\nSince we do not know whether M\u2032 =\u3008\u2206\u2032, <\u2032, I \u2032\u3009 is minimal or canonical, we cannot use it directly; rather, we only use it as a support to the construction of M. As the TBox is satisfiable, by Theorem 46, we know that there exists a minimal canonical model M\u2032\u2032 =\u3008\u2206\u2032\u2032, <\u2032\u2032, I \u2032\u2032\u3009 of the TBox. We extend such a model with domain elements from \u2206\u2032 including those elements interpreting the individuals a1, . . . , am explicitly named in the ABox. Let \u2206 = \u22061 \u222a\u2206\u2032\u2032 where \u22061 = {(ai)I \u2032\n: ai in ABox }\u222a {x \u2208 \u2206\u2032 : x is reachable from some (ai)I \u2032 in M\u2032 by a sequence of RI \u2032 or (R\u2212)I \u2032\n}. We define the rank kM of each domain element in \u2206 as follows. For the elements\ny \u2208 \u2206\u2032\u2032, kM(y) = kM\u2032\u2032 (y). For the elements x \u2208 \u22061, if x = (ai)I \u2032\n, then kM(x) = kM\u2032(x); if x 6= (ai)I \u2032 , then kM(x) = kM\u2032\u2032(X), for some X \u2208 \u2206\u2032\u2032 such that for all\nconcepts C\u2032 \u2208 S, we have x \u2208 (C\u2032)I \u2032 if and only if X \u2208 (C\u2032)I \u2032\u2032\n. We then define I as follows. First, for all ai in ABox we let aIi = (ai)\nI\u2032 . We define the interpretation of each concept as in \u2206\u2032 on the elements of \u22061 and as in \u2206\u2032\u2032 on the elements of \u2206\u2032\u2032. Last, we define the interpretation of each role R as in M\u2032 on the pairs of elements of \u22061 and as in M\u2032\u2032 on the pairs of elements of \u2206\u2032\u2032. I is extended to quantified concepts in the usual way.\nIt can be proven that M satisfies ABox (by definition of I and since M\u2032 satisfies it). Furthermore it can be proven that M satisfies TBox (the full proof is omitted due to space limitations). C(a) does not hold in M, since it does not hold in M\u2032. Last, M is canonical by construction. It is minimal with respect to Definition 10: for all X \u2208 \u22062 kM(X) is the lowest possible rank it can have in any model (by Proposition 13); for all ai \u2208 \u22061, this follows by minimality of kj . From minimality of kj it also follows that M is a minimal canonical model with respect to ABox. Since in M C(a) does not hold, the theorem follows by contraposition. \u2737\nTheorem 8 (Complexity of rational closure over the ABox). Given a knowledge base KB=(TBox,ABox) in SHIQRT, an individual constant a and a concept C, the problem of deciding whether C(a) \u2208 ABox is EXPTIME-complete.\nWe omit the proof, which is similar to the one for rational closure over ABox in ALC (Theorem 5 [18])."}, {"heading": "7 Extending the correspondence to more expressive logics", "text": "A natural question is whether the correspondence between the rational closure and the minimal canonical model semantics of the previous section can be extended to stronger DLs. We give a negative answer for the logic SHOIQ. This depends on the fact that, due to the interaction of nominals with number restriction, a consistent SHOIQ knowledge base may have no canonical models (whence no minimal canonical ones). Let us consider for instance the following example:\nExample 4. Consider the KB, where TBox= {{o} \u2291\u2264 1R\u2212.\u22a4, \u00ac{o} \u2291 \u2265 1R.{o}}, and ABox= {\u00acA(o),\u00acB(o)}.\nKB is consistent and, for instance, the modelM1 = \u3008\u2206,<, I ra, where\u2206 = {x, y}, < is the empty relation, AI = BI = (\u00ac{o})I = {x}, and ({o})I = {y}, is a model of KB. In particular, x \u2208 (A \u2293B)I .\nAlso, there is a model M2 of KB similar to M (with \u22062 = {x2, y}) in which x2 \u2208 (A\u2293\u00acB)I , another one M3 (with \u22063 = {x2, y}) in which x3 \u2208 (\u00acA\u2293B)I , and so on. Hence, {A,B}, {A,\u00acB}, {\u00acA,B}, {\u00acA,\u00acB} are all sets of concepts S that are consistent with KB. Nevertheless, there is no canonical model for KB containing x1, x2 and x3 all together. as the inclusions in the TBox prevent models from containing more than two domain elements.\nThe above example shows that the notion of canonical model as defined in this paper is too strong to capture the notion of rational closure for logics which are as expressive as SHOIQ. Beacause of this negative result, we can regard the correspondence result\nfor SHIQ only as a first step in the definition of a semantic characterization of rational closure for expressive description logics. A suitable refinement of the semantics is needed, and we leave its definition for future work."}, {"heading": "8 Related Works", "text": "There are a number of works which are closely related to our proposal. In [14, 17] nonmonotonic extensions of DLs based on the T operator have been proposed. In these extensions, focused on the basic DL ALC, the semantics of T is based on preferential logic P. Moreover and more importantly, the notion of minimal model adopted here is completely independent from the language and is determined only by the relational structure of models.\n[6] develop a notion of rational closure for DLs. They propose a construction to compute the rational closure of an ALC knowledge base, which is not directly based on Lehmann and Magidor definition of rational closure, but is similar to the construction of rational closure proposed by Freund [12] at a propositional level. In a subsequent work, [8] introduces an approach based on the combination of rational closure and Defeasible Inheritance Networks (INs). In [7], a work on the semantic characterization of a variant of the notion of rational closure introduced in [6] has been presented, based on a generalization to ALC of our semantics in [16].\nAn approach related to ours can be found in [3]. The basic idea of their semantics is similar to ours, but it is restricted to the propositional case. Furthermore, their construction relies on a specific representation of models and it provides a recipe to build a model of the rational closure, rather than a characterization of its properties. Our semantics, defined in terms of standard Kripke models, can be more easily generalized to richer languages, as we have done here for SHIQ.\nIn [5] the semantics of the logic of defeasible subsumptions is strengthened by a preferential semantics. Intuitively, given a TBox, the authors first introduce a preference ordering\u226a on the class of all subsumption relations \u228f\n\u02dc including TBox, then they define\nthe rational closure of TBox as the most preferred relation \u228f \u02dc with respect to \u226a, i.e. such that there is no other relation \u228f\n\u02dc \u2032 such that TBox \u2286 \u228f \u02dc \u2032 and \u228f \u02dc \u2032 \u226a \u228f \u02dc . Furthermore, the\nauthors describe an EXPTIME algorithm in order to compute the rational closure of a given TBox in ALC. [5] does not address the problem of dealing with the ABox. In [24] a plug-in for the Prote\u0301ge\u0301 ontology editor implementing the mentioned algorithm for computing the rational closure for a TBox for OWL ontologies is described.\nRecent works discuss the combination of open and closed world reasoning in DLs. In particular, formalisms have been defined for combining DLs with logic programming rules (see, for instance, [11] and [25]). A grounded circumscription approach for DLs with local closed world capabilities has been defined in [22]."}, {"heading": "9 Conclusions", "text": "In this work we have proposed an extension of the rational closure defined by Lehmann and Magidor to the Description Logic SHIQ, taking into account both TBox and ABox reasoning. Defeasible inclusions are expressed by means of a typicality operator T which selects the typical instances of a concept. One of the contributions is that of\nextending the semantic characterization of rational closure proposed in [16] for propositional logic, to SHIQ, which does not enjoy the finite model property. In particular, we have shown that in all minimal models of a finite KB in SHIQ the rank of domain elements is always finite, although the domain might be infinite, and we have exploited this result to establish the correspondence between the minimal model semantics and the rational closure construction for SHIQ. The (defeasible) inclusions belonging to the rational closure of a SHIQ KB correspond to those that are minimally entailed by the KB, when restricting to canonical models. We have provided some complexity results, namely that, for SHIQ, the problem of deciding whether an inclusion belongs to the rational closure of the TBox is in EXPTIME as well as the problem of deciding whether C(a) belongs to the rational closure of the ABox. Finally, we have shown that the rational closure of a TBox can be computed simply using entailment in SHIQ.\nThe rational closure construction in itself can be applied to any description logic. We would like to extend its semantic characterization to stronger logics, such as SHOIQ, for which the notion of canonical model as defined in this paper is too strong, as we have seen in section 7.\nIt is well known that rational closure has some weaknesses that accompany its wellknown qualities. Among the weaknesses is the fact that one cannot separately reason property by property, so that, if a subclass of C is exceptional for a given aspect, it is exceptional \u201ctout court\u201d and does not inherit any of the typical properties of C. Among the strengths there is its computational lightness, which is crucial in Description Logics. Both the qualities and the weaknesses seems to be inherited by its extension to Description Logics. To address the mentioned weakness of rational closure, we may think of attacking the problem from a semantic point of view by considering a finer semantics where models are equipped with several preference relations; in such a semantics it might be possible to relativize the notion of typicality, whence to reason about typical properties independently from each other.\nAcknowledgement.

Let S be a non-empty set and <\u2217 a transitive, irreflexive relation on S (a strict pre-order). Let U \u2286 S, with U 6= \u2205, we say that x \u2208 S is a minimal element of U with respect to <\u2217 if it holds:\nx \u2208 U and \u2200y \u2208 U we have y 6<\u2217 x.\nGiven U \u2286 S, we denote by Min<\u2217(U) the set of minimal elements of U with respect to <\u2217.\nDefinition 14. Let S and <\u2217 as in previous definition. We say that <\u2217 is well-founded on S if for every non-empty U \u2286 S, we have Min<\u2217(U) 6= \u2205.\nProposition 15. Let S and <\u2217 as above. The following are equivalent:\n1. <\u2217 is well-founded on S; 2. there are no infinite descending chains: . . . xi+1 <\u2217 xi <\u2217 . . . <\u2217 x0 of elements\nof S.\nProof. \u2013 (1) \u21d2 (2). Suppose that <\u2217 is well-founded on S and by absurd that there is an infinite descending chain . . . xi+1 <\u2217 xi <\u2217 . . . <\u2217 x0 of elements of S. Let U be the set of elements of such a chain. Clearly for every xi \u2208 U there is a xj \u2208 U with xj <\u2217 xi. But this means that Min<\u2217(U) = \u2205 against the hypothesis that <\u2217\nis well-founded on S. \u2013 (2) \u21d2 (1). Suppose by absurd that for a non-emptyU \u2286 S, we have thatMin<\u2217(U) = \u2205. Thus:\n\u2200x \u2208 U \u2203y \u2208 U y <\u2217 x\nWe can assume that there is a function f : U \u2212\u2192 U such that f(x) <\u2217 x. [If S is enumerable then f can be defined by means of an enumeration of S (e.g. take the smallest y <\u2217 x in the enumeration); otherwise and more generally, by using the axiom of choice we can proceed as follows: given x \u2208 U , let U\u2193x = {y \u2208 U | y <\u2217 x}, thus for every x \u2208 U the set U\u2193x is non-empty. By the axiom of choice, there is a function g:\ng : {U\u2193x | x \u2208 U} \u2212\u2192 \u22c3\nx\u2208U\nU\u2193x (= U)\nsuch that for every x \u2208 U , g(U\u2193x) \u2208 U\u2193x. We then define f(x) = g(U\u2193x).] Since f(x) < x we also have f(f(x)) <\u2217 f(x) <\u2217 x and so on. Using the notation f i(x) for the i - iteration of f , we can immediatly define an infinite descending chain by fixing x0 \u2208 U and by taking xi = f i(x0) for all i > 0.\nTheorem 9. Let S be a non-empty set and <\u2217 a binary relation on S. The following are equivalent:\n1. <\u2217 is (i) irreflexive, (ii) transitive, (iii) modular, (iv) well-founded. 2. there exists a function k : S \u2212\u2192 Ord such that x <\u2217 y iff k(x) < k(y) (where Ord\nis the set of ordinals).\nProof. \u2013 (2) \u21d2 (1). Suppose that there is a function k : S \u2212\u2192 Ord such that x <\u2217 y iff k(x) < k(\u2032y). We can easily check that properties (i)\u2013(iv) holds: irreflexivity and transitivity are immediate. For (iii) modularity: let x <\u2217 y and z be any element in S. Suppose that x 6<\u2217 z, thus k(x) 6< k(z); then it must be either k(x) = k(z) or k(z) < k(x), whence k(z) < k(y) in both cases, thus z <\u2217 y. For (iv) well-foundedness, suppose by absurd that there is a non-empty U \u2286 S such that Min<\u2217(U) = \u2205, then for every x \u2208 U there is y \u2208 U such that y <\u2217 x. Let us consider the image of U under k: Uk = {k(x) | x \u2208 U}. The set of ordinals Uk has a least element, say \u03b2 \u2208 Ord (this by property of ordinals: every non-empty set of ordinals has a least element). Let z \u2208 U such that k(z) = \u03b2. By hypothesis, there is y \u2208 U such that y <\u2217 u, but then k(y) \u2208 Uk and k(y) < \u03b2, against the fact that \u03b2 is the least ordinal in Uk.\n\u2013 (1) \u21d2 (2) (Sketch). Suppose that <\u2217 satisfies properties (i)\u2013(iv). Let us consider the following sequence of sets indexed on Ordinals:\nS\u03b1 = S \u2212 \u22c3\n\u03b2<\u03b1A\u03b2 A\u03b1 = Min<\u2217(S\u03b1)\nThus S0 = S and A0 = Min<\u2217(S). Observe that if S\u03b1 6= \u2205 then also A\u03b1 6= \u2205 (by well-foundness); moreover the sequence is decreasing: S\u03b1 \u2282 S\u03b2 for \u03b2 < \u03b1. But for cardinality reasons there must be a least ordinal \u03bb such that S\u03bb = \u2205, this means that S\u03bb = S \u2212 \u22c3 \u03b2<\u03bb A\u03b2 = \u2205, so that we get\nS = \u22c3\n\u03b2<\u03bb\nA\u03b2\nIt can be easily shown that: \u2022 for \u03b1 < \u03b2 < \u03bb, \u2200x \u2208 A\u03b1, \u2200y \u2208 A\u03b2 x <\u2217 y, and also A\u03b1 \u2229 A\u03b2 = \u2205 \u2022 for each x \u2208 S, there exists a unique A\u03b1 with \u03b1 < \u03bb such that x \u2208 A\u03b1 \u2022 x <\u2217 y iff for some \u03b1, \u03b2 < \u03bb x \u2208 A\u03b1 and y \u2208 A\u03b2 and \u03b1 < \u03b2. We can then define k(x) = the unique \u03b1 such that x \u2208 A\u03b1 and the result follows."}], "references": [{"title": "Priorities on defaults with prerequisites, and their application in treating specificity in terminological default logic", "author": ["F.
