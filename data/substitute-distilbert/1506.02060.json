In the same way, distance measure is an important tool which describes differences between two objects and considered as a dual concept of similarity measure [12]. The choice of a similarity measure or a distance measure for any fields of research is not trivial [8,10]. Since Zadeh proposed fuzzy sets [11], many scholars have conducted research on similarity measures between fuzzy sets [9,12]. Other similarity measures are proposed for Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy sets as a generalization of fuzzy sets [2, 3, 7]. In this paper, one presents a new measure of distance for the interval ],[ ba and then for bipolar fuzzy values. Based on\nthe new distance, the similarity of bipolar fuzzy values was defined. Then, using the similarity or dissimilarity, the cardinality and entropy measures are constructed for bipolar fuzzy set. All these measures are done for bipolar fuzzy values or bipolar fuzzy set in the framework of penta-valued representation [6]. The paper has the following structure: section 2 presents the fuzzy set and its extensions: intuitionistic fuzzy set, paraconsistent fuzzy set and bipolar fuzzy set. Also, the main operators for bipolar fuzzy sets are presented. Section 3 presents the penta-valued representation of bipolar fuzzy sets defining indexes of truth, falsity, unknowingness, contradiction and ambiguity. Section 4 presents a new distance measure for the interval ],[ ba and its particular\nforms for ]1,0[ and ]1,1[ .

The bipolar fuzzy set (BFS) can be translated into FP5. Particular forms of bipolar fuzzy sets can also be translated to FP5, for example fuzzy sets (FS), intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS) and paraconsistent fuzzy sets (PFS) [6].\n3.1 Bipolar fuzzy set as FP5\nOne considers the bipolar fuzzy set BFSA defined by the membership function  and the non-membership function\n .
