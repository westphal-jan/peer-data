Given a set of n centered p-dimensional datapoints Y \u2208 Rp\u00d7n, the first principal component is\narg max \u2016x\u20162=1\nx>\u03a3\u0302x, (1)\nProceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Lille, France, 2015. JMLR: W&CP volume 37. Copyright 2015 by the author(s).\nwhere \u03a3\u0302 = 1/n \u00b7YY> is the empirical covariance matrix. The principal component spans the direction of maximum data variability. This direction usually involves all p variables of the ambient space, in other words the PC vectors are typically non-sparse. However, it is often desirable to obtain a principal component with specific structure, for example limiting the support of non-zero entries. From a statistical viewpoint, in the high dimensional regime n = O(p), the recovery of the true (population) principal component is only possible if additional structure information, like sparsity, is available for the former (Amini & Wainwright, 2009; Vu & Lei, 2012).\nThere are several approaches for extracting a sparse principal component. Many rely on approximating the solution to\nmax x\u2208Rp\nx>\u03a3\u0302x, subject to \u2016x\u20162 = 1, \u2016x\u20160 \u2264 k. (2)\nThe non-convex quadratic optimization is NP hard (by a reduction from maximum clique problem), but optimally exploits the side information on the sparsity.\nGraph Path PCA. In this paper we enforce additional structure on the support of principal components. Consider a directed acyclic graph (DAG) G = (V,E) on p vertices. Let S and T be two additional special vertices and consider all simple paths from S to T on the graph G. Ignoring the order of vertices along a path, let P(G) denote the collection of all S-T paths in G. We seek the principal component supported on a path of G, i.e., the solution to\nmax x\u2208X (G)\nx>\u03a3\u0302x, (3)\nwhere X (G) , { x\u2208Rp : \u2016x\u20162 = 1, supp(x) \u2208 P(G) } . (4)\nWe will argue that this formulation can be used to impose several types of structure on the support of principal components. Note that the covariance matrix \u03a3\u0302 and the graph\nar X\niv :1\n50 6.\n02 34\n4v 2\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n1 9\nJu n\ncan be arbitrary: the matrix is capturing data correlations while the graph is a mathematical tool to efficiently describe the possible supports of interest. We illustrate this through a few applications.\nFinancial model selection: Consider the problem of identifying which companies out of the S&P500 index capture most data variability. Running Sparse PCA with a sparsity parameter k will select k companies that maximize explained variance. However, it may be useful to enforce more structure: If we must select one company from each business sector (e.g., Energy, Health Care,etc.) how could we identify these representative variables?\nIn Section 4, we show that this additional requirement can be encoded using our graph path framework. We compare our variable selection with Sparse PCA and show that it leads to interpretable results.\nBiological and fMRI networks: Several problems involve variables that are naturally connected in a network. In these cases our Graph Path PCA can enforce interpretable sparsity structure, especially when the starting and ending points are manually selected by domain experts. In section 4, we apply our algorithm on fMRI data using a graph on regions of interest (ROIs) based on the Harvard-Oxford brain structural atlas (Desikan et al., 2006).\nWe emphasize that our applications to brain data is preliminary: the directional graphs we extract are simply based on distance and should not be interpreted as causality, simply as a way of encoding desired supports.\nWhat can we say about the tractability of (3)? We note that despite the additional constraints on the sparsity patterns, the number of admissible support sets (i.e. S-T paths) can be exponential in p, the number of variables. For example, consider a graph G as follows: S connected to two nodes who are then both connected to two nodes, etc. for k levels and finally connected to T . Clearly there are 2k S-T paths and therefore a direct search is not tractable.\nOur Contributions:\n1. From a statistical viewpoint, we show that side information on the underlying graph G can reduce the number of observations required to recover the population principal component x? \u2208 X (G) via (3). For our analysis, we introduce a simple, sparsity-inducing network model on p vertices partitioned into k layers, with edges from one layer to the next, and maximum out-degree d (Fig. 1). We show that n = O(log p/k + k log d) observations yi \u223c N(0,\u03a3), suffice to obtain an arbitrarily good estimate via (3). Our proof follows the steps of (Vu & Lei, 2012).\n2. We complement this with an information-theoretic lower bound on the minimax estimation error, un-\nder the spiked covariance model with latent signal x? \u2208 X (G), which matches the upper bound.\n3. We propose two algorithms for approximating the solution of (3), based on those of (Yuan & Zhang, 2013) and (Papailiopoulos et al., 2013; Asteris et al., 2014) for the sparse PCA problem. We empirically evaluate our algorithms on synthetic and real datasets.\nRelated Work There is a large volume of work on algorithms and the statistical analysis of sparse PCA (Johnstone & Lu, 2004; Zou et al., 2006; d\u2019Aspremont et al., 2008; 2007; Johnstone & Lu, 2004; Vu & Lei, 2012; Amini & Wainwright, 2009). On the contrary, there is limited work that considers additional structure on the sparsity patterns. Motivated by a face recognition application, (Jenatton et al., 2010) introduce structured sparse PCA using a regularization that encodes higher-order information about the data. The authors design sparsity inducing norms that further promote a pre-specified set of sparsity patterns.\nFinally, we note that the idea of pursuing additional structure on top of sparsity is not limited to PCA: Modelbased compressive sensing seeks sparse solutions under a restricted family of sparsity patterns (Baldassarre et al., 2013; Baraniuk et al., 2010; Kyrillidis & Cevher, 2012), while structure induced by an underlying network is found in (Mairal & Yu, 2011) for sparse linear regression."}, {"heading": "2.

Besides sparsity, we impose additional structure on the latent signal; structure induced by a (known) underlying graph G.\nConsider a p-dimensional signal x? and a bijective mapping between the p variables in x? and the vertices of G.

In the sequel, we provide a sketch proof of Theorem 1, following the steps of (Vu & Lei, 2012).\nThe key idea is to discretize the space X (G) in order to utilize the Generalized Fano Inequality (Yu, 1997). The next lemma summarizes Fano\u2019s Inequality for the special case in which the n observations are distibuted according to the n-fold product measure D(n)p (x?): Lemma 2.1 (Generalized Fano (Yu, 1997)).
