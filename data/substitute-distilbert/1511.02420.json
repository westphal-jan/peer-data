Introduction", "text": "Prediction of ozone level is an important factor for modern urban management. A proper\npredictor can help the air quality agencies for decision-making and announcing the alarms.\nThe ozone level can be considered as a chaotic time series. In the literature, there are two\napproaches for forecasting ozone level, including 1) non-linear differential equation based\nmethods and 2) neural based methods. Mathematical models include kalman filter, ARMA,\nARCH and GARCH etc. and Artificial intelligence (AI) methods consist of learning based\nmethods such as multilayer neural network (ANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems\n(ANFIS) [38-44] and the brain emotional learning (BEL). AI methods can learn the behavior\nof the data by observing the previous values, and can predict the future values. Firstly, this\npaper aims to design an alarm system of ozone level base on AI models such as BEL.\nSecondly, here we compare the AI\u2019s methods including BEL, ANFIS and ANN in the\nIsfahan\u2019s ozone level prediction task in order to find the best predictor. Isfahan is a modern\ncity of Iran, and the ozone level prediction is very important for its urban management. So we\nconsider the ozone level dataset of Isfahan city as a case study to compare the AI\u2019s models.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows: The proposed system is described in Section 2.\nThe Comparative results are presented in Section 3. Finally the conclusions are made in\nSection 4.\n2. Proposed system\nThe geomagnetic studies [47] has shown that solar ultraviolet (UV), total solar radiation\n(TSR) and current total ozone (O3) can affect the next level of O3. So our system applies\nthem to make the alarms. The general view of proposed system is presented in Fig. 1. The\nproposed system is very simple. There are three sensors taht fed a program based on AI\nmethods run on the computer. And the computer fed an alarm module or any display or\nmassaging module. In order to find the best AI model, we compare three well know models\nof this field, including BEL, ANFIS and ANN."}, {"heading": "2.1. BEL", "text": "The BEL algorithm comes from a neurophysiological aspect of the brain, shows to be a\nnovel proper learning algorithm and is an appropriate online predictor for complex\nsystems. The supervised BEL approach (Lotfi and Akbarzadeh 2013; 2014a; 2014b;\n2014c) [10] can learn pattern-target samples and can apply well to prediction problems.\nFurthermore, BEL profits a decay mechanism for Amygdala and a monotonic learning\nrule. It is a novel recognizer artifact with very simple structure that is motivated by\nneurophysiological knowledge of the limbic system of the brain [13-20]. Supervised\nBEL can be used in pattern recognition, classificat ion, prediction and the fitting\nproblems. The supervised BEL is utilized here to predict the ozone level of Isfahan city,\nwhere the low value of ozone is very dangerous.\nFig. 2 shows supervised BEL. It\u2019s a feed forward neural network that is based on\namygdala-orbitofrontal interacts. The functionality of amygdale is considered as a threshold\nlogic unit. This structure can be distributed as a multi output structure and is considered the\ntarget values in learning process. This structure is model free and can be used in multi input\nmulti output classification and prediction problems. The learning algorithm of the model\npresented in Fig.2, has been described in (Lotfi and Akbarzadeh 2012, 2013). The learning\nalgorithm includes two rules which are as follows:\nk j k a kk j k j pEtvv )0,max()1( 1   (1)\nk j kkk j k j ptEww )( 1   (2)\nwhere k is learning step, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are learning rates and \u03b3 is decay rate in amygdala learning\nrule, where the k a k Et  is calculated error. This model has been used in various applications\n[1-12] and [20-34] and is developed here to predict the ozone level problem."}, {"heading": "2.2 ANFIS", "text": "ANFIS [45] combines the fuzzy approaches and artificial neural networks (ANNs) in order to\nuse the advantages of them. In ANFIS model, the fuzzy rules and membership functions are\ngenerated automatically by a neural network learning algorithm. Fig. 3 shows the architecture\nof Sugeno-type ANFIS. This architecture includes the following five layers; fuzzifier,\nproduction, normalized, defuzzy, and output layer.\nIn this sample ANFIS architecture presented in Fig. 3, the learning parameters including\nw1, w2, z1, z2 and A1, A2, B1, B2 should be adjusted. This adjustment is performed by using\ninput-target examples (Jang 1997) [45]."}, {"heading": "2.3 ANN", "text": "ANN is inspired by physiological workings of the brain. ANN resembles the actual networks\nof neural cells (neurons) in the brain. ANN have particular characteristics such as the ability\nto learn and generalize. ANN learns through the error back propagation algorithm. According\nto this algorithm, the error of output units is propagated back to adjust the connecting weights\nwithin the network. The 2-2-1 architecture of ANN is presented in Fig. 4. It\u2019s a two input-\nsingle output architecture with two neurons in hidden layer. This architecture has single\nhidden layer with two hidden neurons..

Simulation results", "text": "To assess the model, a dataset is obtained from Isfahan\u2019s research institutes. The dataset is\naccessible from www.bitools.ir. The dataset includes the daily ozone level of Isfahan from\n1/1/2000 to 7/6/2011. Fig 4 shows the first 500 values of the Isfahan\u2019s ozone level time\nseries. The dataset is divided into the three parts; the first is the training set that includes 70%\nof data selected randomly. And the second is the validating set that is 15% data and the thirds\nis testing set where the prediction results are evaluated and it\u2019s 15% of the data. Fig. 6\nillustrates the comparative results of prediction obtained from BEL, ANN and ANFIS.\nAccording to the results the ANFIS shows higher correlation that BEL and ANN. Figs. 7 and\n8 show the target and predicted level obtained from BEL and ANN respectively.\nFigs. 7 and 8 are the curve of predicted level versus observation from 1/1/2000 to 7/6/2011.\nAs illustrated in the figures, the best COR = 0.80234 is obtained from the BEL model. In\nthese experiments, the models have applied the previous 4 values of each point of ozone\nlevel. So the size of input patterns is 4.\nThus in the system presented in Fig. 1, ANFIS algorithm is an optimum solution for\nozone prediction. The final step of design is associated with determination of a logical\nthreshold on predicted O3 to set the alarm massages. This threshold should be\ndetermined manually and by expert, and system manager."}, {"heading": "4. Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, firstly we propose a novel alarm system for ozone level. Secondly we develop\nthe BEL algorithm for ozone level prediction task and compare the results of BEL, ANFIS\nand ANN in order to find the best AI model in the system. In the numerical studies, BEL,\nANFIS and ANN is utilized to predict the Isfahan\u2019s ozone level. According to the\nsimulations, ANFIS shows higher correlation in the prediction task. ANFIS associated with\nthree input sensors of O3, UV and TSR and with a determined threshold can be used as an\nalarm module for major cities."}], "references": [{"title": "Emotional Brain-Inspired Adaptive Fuzzy Decayed Learning for online prediction problems", "author": ["E.

important task of air quality agencies of modern cities. In this paper, we design an ozone level alarm system (OLP) for Isfahan city and test it through the real word data from 1/1/2000 to 7/6/2011. We propose a computer based system with three inputs and single output. The inputs include three sensors of solar ultraviolet (UV), total solar radiation (TSR) and total ozone (O3). And the output of the system is the predicted O3 of the next day and the alarm massages. A developed artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm is applied to determine the output, based on the inputs variables. For this issue, AI models, including supervised brain emotional learning (BEL), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), are compared in order to find the best model. The simulation of the proposed system shows that it can be used successfully in prediction of major cities\u2019 ozone level.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
