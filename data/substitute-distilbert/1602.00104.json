Basically, the meaning has been stored in the dictionary, the dictionary was based on events that have occurred in the social, and today they have been shared on the web page. The issues of disambiguation therefore is related to the special case of WSD (word sense disambiguation) [1,2], especially with the name of someone who is also the words. Today, along with the growth of the web on the Internet, it is difficult to determine a web page associated with the intended person is right and proper, especially with the presence of semantic meaning as a synonymy and polysemy. Therefore, this paper expressed an approach for identifying a person with exploring web snippets.\n\u22c6 Proceeding of International Conference on Information Technology and Engineering Application (4-th ICIBA), Book 1, 119-125, February 20-21, 2015."}, {"heading": "2 Research Methodology", "text": ""}, {"heading": "2.1 Related Work", "text": "Most of works addressed the name disambiguation, among them about preparing information for person-specific [3]; finding to the association of persons such as the social networks [4]; distinguishing the different persons with keyword/key phrases [5], associating a domain of citations in the scientific papers [6], etc. However, none of the mentioned works attempt to extract dynamic features of person as the current context to do name disambiguation through queries expansion as a way for fighting against explosion of information on the Internet, that is increasing and expanding relationship between the persons and the words continuously, mainly to face the common words like \u201dinformation\u201d, that is an indwell word always for each person in information era.\nSemantically, there are motivations of disambiguation problem:\n1. Meronymy [7]: x is part y or \u201dis-a\u201d, part to whole relation - the semantic relation that holds between a part and the whole. In other word, the page for x belong to the categories of y. For example, the page for the Barack Obama in Wikipedia1 belong to the categories (a) President of the United State2, (b) United States Senate3, (c) Illinois Senate4, (d) Black people5, etc. In other case, some entities are associated with multi-categories. For example, Noam Chomsky is a linguist and Noam Chomsky is also a critic of American foreign policy. 2. Honolomy: x has y as part of itself or \u201dhas-a\u201d, whole to part relation - the semantic relation that holds between a whole and its parts. For example, in DBLP, the author name \u201dShahrul Azman Mohd Noah\u201d has a name label as \u201dShahrul Azman Noah\u201d. 3. Hyponymy [8]: x be subordinate of y or \u201dhas-property\u201d, subordination - the semantic relation of being subordinate or belong to a lower rank or class. In other word, the page for x has subcategories of y. For example, the homepage of \u201dTengku Mohd Tengku Sembok\u201d has categories pages: Home, Biography, Curriculum Vitae, Gallery, Others, Contact, Links, etc. Some pages also contain name label \u201dTengku Mohd Tengku Sembok\u201d. 4. Synonymy [9,10]: x denotes the same as y, the semantic relation that holds between two words or can (in the context) express the same meaning. This means that the entity may have multiple name variations/abbreviations in citations across publications. For example, in DBLP, the author name \u201dTengku\n1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama 2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States 3 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate 4 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_Senate_career_of_Barack_Obama 5 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people\nMohd Tengku Sembok\u201d is sometimes written as \u201dT. Mohd T. Sembok\u201d, \u201dTengku M. T. Sembok\u201d. 5. Polysemy [10]: Lexical ambiguity, individual word or phrase or label that can be used to express two or more different meanings. This means that different entities may share the same name label in multiple citations. For example, both \u201dGuangyu Chen\u201d and \u201dGuilin Chen\u201d are used as \u201dG. Chen\u201d in their citations."}, {"heading": "2.2 A Model", "text": "Let A = {ai|i = 1, ...,M} is a set of person (real-world entities). There is Ad = {bj|j = 1, ..., N} as a set of ambiguous names which need to be disambiguated, e.g., {\u201dJohn Barnes\u201d,. . .}, thus A is a reference entities table containing peoples which the names in Ad may represent, e.g. {\u201dJohn Barnes (computer scientist)\u201d, \u201dJohn Barnes (American author)\u201d, \u201dJohn Barnes (football player)\u201d,. . .}. Consider D = {dk|k = 1, . . . ,K} is a set of documents containing the names in Ad, where possibility At = {atl|l = 1, . . . , L} is a set of composition of name tokens (first/middle/last name or in abbreviations), and due to a person has multiple name variations, e.g., \u201dShahrul Azman Noah (Professor)\u201d has names/aliases as in {\u201dShahrul Azman Mohd Noah\u201d, \u201dShahrul Azman Noah\u201d, \u201dS. A. M. Noah\u201d, \u201dNoah, S. A. M.\u201d, . . .}. Moreover, the persons name sometimes affected by the background of social communities, like nation, tribes, religion, etc., where a community simply is characterized by the properties in common. For example, some names of Malaysia or Indonesia peoples sometimes insert special terms: \u201dbin\u201d, \u201db\u201d, \u201dbinti\u201d or \u201dbt\u201d (respect to \u201dson of\u201d or daughter of\u201d), e.g., one name variation of \u201dShahrul Azman Noah\u201d is \u201dShahrul Azman b Mohd Noah\u201d. In another case, an certain community give the characteristic to communitys members, such as the academic community will add the academic degree such as \u201dProf.\u201d (professor) to its members.\nIdentifying named entity relates to all observed names in D, i.e., Ax = {axo|o = 1, . . . , O}, which need to be patterned and disambiguated. The persons names can be rendered differently in online information sources. They are not named with single pattern of tokens, they are not also labeled with unique identifiers, and therefore the names of people also associated with the uncertain things. Text searching relies on matching pattern, searching on a name based on pattern will only match the form a searcher enters in a search box. This causes low recall and negatively affects search precision [11], when the name of a single person is represented in different ways in the same database [12], such as on the motivation above.\nIndeed, in scientific publications such as from IEEE, ACM, Springer, etc., all need the shortened forms of name, especially forenames represented only by initials. However, the shortened form of name is not only makes the name variation, but it creates the name ambiguity in online information sources, such as Web. For example, the name \u201dJ. Barnes\u201d can represent \u201dJohn Barnes (computer scientist)\u201d, \u201dJack Barnes (American communist leader)\u201d, \u201dJohnnie Barnes (American football player)\u201d, \u201dJohnny Barnes (Bermudian eccentric)\u201d, \u201dJoshua Barnes\n(English scholar)\u201d, etc. Name disambiguation is an important problem in information extraction about persons, and is one of themes in Semantic Web. Thus, the persons name can be expressed by using different aliases due to multiple reasons as motives: use of abbreviations, different naming conventions, misspelling, pseudonyms in publication or bibliographies (citations), or naming variations over time. Some different real world entities have the same name, or they share some aliases. So, it is also a semantic problem. We conclude that there are two fundamental reasons of name disambiguation semantically for identifying entities generally, or persons specially, i.e.,\n1. different entities can share the same name (lexical ambiguity), and 2. a single entity can be designated by multiple names (referential ambiguity).\nFormally, these name disambiguation problems have tasks:\n1. \u2200a \u2208 A, there is a relation \u03be to assign a list of documents D containing a\nsuch that \u03be : A M :N \u2212\u2192 Ad, Ad is a subset of Ax, where \u03be(a) \u2208 Ad,\n2. \u2200a \u2208 A, there is a relation \u03b6 : A M :L \u2212\u2192 At, At is a subset of Ax, where\n\u03b6(a) \u2208 At.\nSemantically, extracting the keyword from web snippet is to tie \u03be and \u03b6 into a bundle whereby a group of documents exactly associate with one entity only."}, {"heading": "2.3 Proposed Approach", "text": "We start this approach with describing some concepts:\n1. A word w is the basic unit of discrete data, defined to be an item from a vocabulary indexed by {1, . . . ,K}, where wk = 1 if k \u2208 K, and wk = 0 otherwise; 2. A term tx consists of at least one word or a sequence of words, or tx = (w1, . . . , wl), l = k, k is a number of parameters representing word, and |tx| = k is size of tx; 3. Let a web page denoted by \u03c9 and a set of web pages indexed by search engine be containing pairs of term and web page. Let tx is a search term and a web page contain tx is \u03c9x, we obtain \u2126x = {(tx, \u03c9x)}, \u2126x is a subset of \u2126, or tx \u2208 \u03c9x in \u2126x. |\u2126x| = |{tx, \u03c9x}| is cardinality of x; 4. Let tx is a search term. S = {wa, . . . , wmax} is a web snippet (briefly snippet) about tx that returned by search engine, where max = \u00b150 words. L = {Si|i = 1, . . . , N} is a list of snippet.\nBased on these concepts, we develop an approach based on the overlap principle [13] to extract keywords from web snippet. The interpretation of overlap principle by using the query as a composition of tx \u2229 ty or \u201dtx,ty\u201d is to get a reflection the real world from the web, while to implement it we use one of similarity measures, for example, the similarity based on Kolmogorov complexity [14]\nsim(tx, ty) = log(2|\u2126x \u2229\u2126y|\nlog(|\u2126x|+ |\u2126y |) (1)\nWe assume that ambiguity is caused by overlapping interpretations and understanding of the things that exist in the real world. This assumption describes the usefulness of intersection of regular sets. Therefore, we can formulate the conditions of the overlap principle as follows:\nFor first condition (Condition 1): Let tx be a term and ta is a representation term of person name a \u2208 A. We define a condition of overlap principle of tx and ta, i.e. ta\u2229tx = \u2205, but ta, tx \u2208 \u03c9a and ta, tx \u2208 \u03c9x, such that ta, tx \u2208 S.\nSecond condition (Condition 2): Let ta, tx, ty \u2208 S with |\u2126x| = |\u2126y|. We define a condition of overlap principle between ta and tx or ty, i.e. |\u2126a\u2229\u2126x| > |\u2126a \u2229\u2126y|."}, {"heading": "3 Results and Discussion", "text": ""}, {"heading": "3.1 Evaluation and Dataset", "text": "Consider a set L of documents or snippets, each containing a reference to a person. Let P = {P1, . . . , P|P |} be a partition of \u03be and \u03b6 into references to the same person, so for example Pi = {S1, S4, S5, S9} might be a set of references to \u201dAbdul Razak Hamdan\u201d the information technology professor. Let C = {C1, . . . , C|C|} be a collection of disjoint subset of L created by algorithm and manually validated such that each Si has a identifier, i.e., URL address, Table 1. Then, we will denote by LC the references that have been clusters based on collection. Based on measure were introduced [9], we define a notation of recall Rec() as follows: Rec(Si) = (|{S \u2208 P (Si) : C(S) = C(Si)}|)/(|{S \u2208 P (Si)}|) and a notation of precision Prec() as follows: Prec(Si) = (|{S \u2208 C(Si) : P (S) = P (Si)}|)/(|{S \u2208 C(Si)}|) where P (Si) as a set Pi containing reference Si and C(Si) to be the set Ci containing Si. Thus, the precision of a reference to \u201dAbdul Razak Hamdan\u201d is the fraction of references in the same cluster that are also to \u201dAbdul Razak Hamdan\u201d. We obtain average recall (REC), precision (PREC), and F -measure for the clustering C as follows:\nREC =\n\u2211 S\u2208LC Rec(S)\n|LC | (2)\nPREC =\n\u2211 S\u2208LC Prec(S)\n|LC | (3)\nF = 2 \u00b7REC \u00b7 PREC\nREC + PREC (4)"}, {"heading": "3.2 Experiment", "text": "Let us consider information context of actors, that includes all relevant relationships as well as interaction history, where Yahoo! Search engines fall short of utilizing any specific information, especially context information, and just use full text index search in web snippets. In experiment, we use maximum of 1, 000 web snippets for search term ta representing an actor. The web snippets generate the words list for each actor, outputs very rare words because of the diversity its vocabularies. For example, the list of words for a named actor \u201dAbdul Razak Hamdan\u201d generated a list of 26 candidate words. For example, we have as many as 85 web pages about Abdul Razak Hamdan in our dataset. By using Yahoo! Search, we execute the query \u201dAbdul Razak Hamdan\u201d and a keyword \u201dscience\u201d, then we get 39 web pages that contain the name \u201dAbdul Razak Hamdan\u201d and a word \u201dscience\u201d, and in accordance with our dataset. We obtain this value when loading 387-th web page, and this value persists until the maximum number of loading of web pages, i.e. 500. Thus, we obtain Rec(\u201dAbdulah Razak Hamdan,science\u201d) = 46% and Prec(\u201dAbdullah Razak Hamdan,science\u201d) = 10%.
