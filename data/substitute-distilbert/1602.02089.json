The model characterizes individual words as co-occurrence vectors. Composite terms are constructed based on the grammatical structure described by a Lambek pregroup grammar. Both pregroup grammars and vector spaces have a compact closed monoidal structure, and therefore the operations in the grammar can be transferred to vector spaces. The grammar includes atomic types n for nouns and s for sentences, with adjoints xr, xl such that: xlx \u2264 1 \u2264 xxl and xxr \u2264 1 \u2264 xrx, and composite types such as verb = nrsnl. A string of words is represented by the juxtaposition of the relevant types. For example, \u201cPriscilla eats bananas\u201d is rendered as n(nrsnl)n. The reduction rules are applied, and if the resulting type is an s, the sentence is judged grammatical. In the given example, we have nnrsnln \u2264 1 \u00b7 snln \u2264 1 \u00b7 s \u00b7 1 \u2264 s. Reductions can be described in a graphical calculus, shown in figure 1.\nPriscilla\nn\neats\nsnr nl\nbananas\nn\nFigure 1: The reduction nnrsnln \u2264 s represented in the graphical calculus.\nWithin the category of vector spaces, concatenation of atomic types into composite types, and words into sentences, is rendered as a tensor product. The reduction map \u01eb is an inner product."}, {"heading": "3 Integrated Connectionist/Symbolic Cognitive Architecture", "text": "In [4], symbols are represented in a high dimensional vector space as the tensor product of filler vectors fi, representing meaning, and role vectors ri, which specify type. These composite filler/role vectors are concatenated by summation. Filler/role vectors may also be recursively embedded, and structures such as sentences may be represented as a sum s = \u2211 i fi \u2297 ri.\nGrammars are represented by matrices W = \u2211\ni wiWi. Rules are encoded in each Wi so that\nthe calculation H(s) = s\u22a4Ws returns a weighted sum of the number of times each rule occurs in the sentence. The quantity H(s) is called harmony, and provides a graded measure of well-formedness of a sentence. For example, a harmonic grammar for intransitive sentences could have the rules 1) S \u2192 N V and 2) \u201cS is at the root\u201d, encoded in weight matrices WS\u2192NV and WS . The sentence s = \u201cJohn runs\u201d obeys both these rules, so if each rule has weighting 1, we assign the sentence a harmony value H(s) = 2. However, the sentence \u201cruns John\u201d does not obey the rule S \u2192 N V , and so we assign it harmony H(t) = 1. We can therefore judge \u201cJohn runs\u201d to be more grammatical than \u201cruns John\u201d. These calculations can be performed using a vector representation s of the sentence and matrix representation (WS +WS\u2192NV ) of the grammar, so that H(s) = s\u22a4(WS +WS\u2192NV )s."}, {"heading": "4 Comparisons with the DisCo Model", "text": "S&L introduce a graded notion of grammaticality, whereas grammaticality in pregroup grammar is binary. However, we can draw parallels between the use of the rule matrices in the ICS architecture and the operations of the DisCo model. In S&L\u2019s framework, components of a sentence interact indirectly through the rules of the grammar. In contrast, components of sentences in the DisCo model interact directly. Further, rule matrices in the ICS architecture have a similar structure to components of a sentence. We could consider the rule matrices themselves to be components of the sentence, and matrix multiplication to act as cancellation between components.\nWe may then view rules of the form WX\u2192AB as corresponding to one or more \u01eb reductions, and WS to the fact that the sentence should reduce to s. We therefore define a simple harmonic grammar in the DisCo framework by assigning one point to an \u01eb-reduction and one to reducing to the type s. Then the ungrammatical sentence \u201cJohn is who Mary loves\u201d (figure 2), can be given a measure of grammaticality.\nJohn\nis\nwho\nMary\nloves\nThe contribution to grammaticality of other operations in the DisCo framework, such as type introduction or operations within Frobenius algebra [1] can be investigated. Further questions include how word sequences could be rendered grammatical, for example by adding, removing, or permuting words, and how a graded measure could aid search in production of grammatical sentences."}], "references": [{"title": "The Frobenius anatomy of relative pronouns", "author": ["Stephen Clark", "Bob Coecke", "Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh"], "venue": "In The 13th Meeting on the Mathematics of Language,", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2013}, {"title": "Combining symbolic and distributional models of meaning", "author": ["Stephen Clark", "Stephen Pulman"], "venue": "In AAAI Spring Symposium: Quantum Interaction,", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 2007}, {"title": "Mathematical foundations for distributed compositional model of meaning", "author": ["B Coecke", "M Sadrzadeh", "S Clark"], "venue": "Lambek Festschrift.
