In particular, Buckwalter (2002) focused mainly on contemporary newspaper texts, which makes the analyzer both underrecognize \u2014because of lack of lexical and morphological coverage\u2014 and overrecognize (by spuriously increasing the amount of ambiguity because of the inclusion of historically and linguistically implausible alternatives) texts from other genres.\nSome of these inconsistencies were tackled by the Revised AM model (henceforth RAM) presented in Boella et al. (2011). However, the necessity of a structural, opposite to incremental, revision and expansion of AM appears clearly in the impossibility to let a merely increased version effectively go beyond a certain level of\nperformance in analyzing, e.g. Classical and modern informal texts.\nXRAM presents itself as a structurally revised AM, which alters the basic original structure by adding usage and genre markers and by accruing the original, rigidly context-free conception of the analyzer by limited statistically gathered contextual selection information. These enhancements allow for a sensibly higher level of performance (see Section 3)."}, {"heading": "2 Description of XRAM", "text": "XRAM, just like AM and RAM, has a purpose of analyzing texts, but in a much more defined and thorough way.\nIn order to enhance the accuracy of the analysis we implemented a flag-selectable usage markers tool through the addition of a supplementary field in the Buckwalter analyzer (cfr infra \u00a7 2.1).\nAfter selecting a single flag or a set of flags, according to the text genre, the text is tokenized and all the punctuation and formatting structure is stripped and factored out. Hence, the program produces a list of tokens ready to be processed by the XRAM analyzer, which aims to create a list of possible analyses for each token represented in the original text.\nTypes (distinct tokens) are analyzed and a dictionary of analysis, that assigns to each type a POS and a lemma, is created in order to reduce computing time.\nAs mentioned above, ambiguity is a significant weakness in the original AM model, which definitely compromises the correct analysis of the text. The XRAM RE module intervenes to reduce this ambiguity by filtering candidate analyses through a limited set of regular expressions. This module introduces a limited amount of context-sensitiveness in the system.\nAnalyses that survive the RE module are then ranked through a simple Language Model (LM) module, based upon Buckwalter and Parkinson\u2019s (2011) frequency list. Ranking introduces an order dimension in ambiguous analyses by assigning decreasing levels of plausibility to POSlemma tuples.\nXRAM capitalizes on the LM module by producing a semi-automated XML tagging of the original text according to the TEI P5 standard: the analysis with the higher rank is proposed as the default analysis, while other ones, lower in rank, are written in the XML output as alternative analyses."}, {"heading": "2.1 Flag-selectable usage markers", "text": "In order to make XRAM linguistic analysis even more reliable, markers are provided for graphemic, morphological and lexical features belonging to specific language varieties among Classical Arabic (CA), Modern Standard Arabic (MSA, formal), and Informal Colloquial Arabic\n(ICA, informal) and technical and scientific sublanguage. Inspiration came from Buckwalter & Parkinson\u2019s (2011) Frequency Dictionary (Buckwalter and Parkinson, 2011): for each recorded lemma, the dictionary provides morphological, syntactic, orthographic and phonetic information as well as usage restrictions and register variations, according to the corpus where a lemma can be found, exclusively or most frequently. Markers are encoded with flags which can be selected or unselected according to the language variety or genre the corpus to be processed is representative of. The genre selection step is user input by now, since it is outside the main task of the project, but several ways to detect it (semi-) automatically might be envisaged. This allows the analyzer reduce the amount of false positives by discarding of non-relevant gender- and variety-specific features. Flags were specified according to a number of diaphasic classification criteria, taking into account lexical expansion and morphological phenomena. Flags are labeled as follows:\nExisting flags reflect the range of text genres included in the corpuses and subcorpuses available in our research. The system can be easily expanded by adding new flags.\nFlags selection is usually compounded: for example, when processing a corpus of classical texts, XRAM_MSA, XRAM_ICA, XRAM_SPEC_MED, XRAM_FNE and XRAM_CAP flags will be deselected in order to optimize the output analysis.\nFlags can be easily and efficiently implemented according to standard IT practices\n(as XORed bits), which makes genre and text type filtering quick and consistent."}, {"heading": "2.2 Probabilistic mildly context-sensitive annotation", "text": "POS-tagging is one of the core tasks AM carries out since its inception, along with tokenization and word-segmentation. Since no syntactic information is provided to the program, AM shows a high degree of morphological and lexical ambiguity, particularly when processing unvocalized texts, due to the homography which characterizes written Arabic\ne.g. WORD: \u0628\u0627\u062a\u0643\u0644\u0627 Al+ktAb+ \u0628\u0627\u062a\u0643\u0644\u0627 1 Al+kitAb+ \u066d\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0643\u0650\u066d\u0644\u0627 kitAb_1 [\u0628\u062a\u0643] the+book+ Al/DET+Ndu+ 2 Al+kut~Ab+ \u0644\u0627\u066d\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0651\u0643\u064f\u066d kut~Ab_1 [\u0628\u062a\u0643] the+kuttab (village school);Quran school+ Al/DET+N+ 3 Al+kut~Ab+ \u066d\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0651\u0643\u064f\u066d\u0644\u0627 kAtib_1 [\u0628\u062a\u0643] the+authors;writers+ Al/DET+N+\nTo overcome this weakness, the Revised version of AraMorph, RAM (Boella et al., 2011) relayed on the vocalization of hadith texts. Notwithstanding, RAM produces good results only when processing a restricted range of textgenres, i.e. CA vocalized texts. This is why a further improvement of RAM is needed through the application of a mildly context-sensitive process of disambiguation. Specifically we adopted a streamline of two different but complementary approaches: (i) a filtering RE component (XRAM RE module) and (ii) a ranking LM module.\nOn the one hand, the filtering RE component reduces the amount of possible analyses by filtering out candidate sequences through regular expressions. E.g., the preposition \u0639\u0645 ma\u02bfa \u2018with\u2019 unambiguously requires to be followed by a noun or (marginally) an adjective: the RE component includes a rule (symbolically represented as [* \u0639\u0645 V]) to filter out candidate\nanalyses of a word as a verb when preceded by \u0639\u0645.\nOn the other hand, the LM component ranks candidate analysis according to the probability of individual POS-lemma tuples. This is a localsensitive disambiguation strategy which guides the ranking of alternative morphological analysis for each lemma identified by XRAM. The more these word combinations are likely to occur in the training and testing bases for this kind of strategy, the higher would be their ranking level, i.e. they will occupy top positions in the list of analyses provided by XRAM.\nThe LM component uses a hybrid approach: a order-3 language model drawn from a manually corrected sample is compounded with frequencies for individual POS-lemma tuples drawn from Buckwalter & Parkinson (2011).\nThis will drastically change the previous versions of AM, giving the research in the field of Arabic Corpus Linguistics and Arabic Computational Linguistics a whole new perspective and a even more functional degree of analysis, creating a morphologic-syntax interface."}, {"heading": "2.3 Lexical and morphological XML tagging of texts", "text": "Aiming to analyze texts taken from Arabic corpuses, specific sections of the study have been conducted designing materials on the XML language, using the model available in TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) 1 P5 structure for textual annotation. Textual annotation is schemed adopting specific tags which help users identify precise information behind markers. The TEI standard, which has been chosen for its versatility and adaptability to various typologies of texts, fits well these specific purposes, even if adapted by validators from to time, depending on cases.\nMorphological and lexical annotations are instead based on results given by RAM which provides a precise analysis of each occurring lemma, giving information in matter of stems, function of the word and a series of tags showing morphological features.\nCombination of the two systems showed a remarkable success level, enabling readers to clearly identify every available information on given materials, including both textual and wordrelated (morphological and lexical) information. In fact, in addition to tags and basilar\n1 http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml.\ninformation, such a mixing provides general information which clearly identify the main features of the texts (such as the average length, frequency and occurrence of lemmas, identification of specific elements) just interpreting the combinations derived from the two overlapped patterns.\nBy way of partially re-writing and so extend RAM operating range, a further development will be then the semi-automatic annotation of XML texts modeled on TEI structure.\nThus, analyzing Arabic annotated texts employing RAM, the result will provide each word with all possible readings, giving specific information for every reading annotated.\nFurthermore, splitting information deriving from RAM analysis, process of combination is refined by embedding data in the XML elements provided by standard TEI. In particular, the tag used to identify a word from the text is <w>, with an additional series of attributes as \u2018lemma\u2019 or \u2018type\u2019 to distinguish base-forms and specific functions.\nThe system automatically assigns the top ranked analysis selected by the LM component the <w> tag (which, as a container, cannot be embedded for one and the same input word), while marking less likely analyses with the annotation tag <note> with the analysis encoded in the \u2018ana\u2019 attribute in order to distinguish different readings of the same word.\nWhile reviewing the XML output text, the annotator can reverse the default analysis by adding an attribute ed=\"correct\" to one of the <note> elements. An XLST transformation takes care of promoting the marked analysis to <w> and to demote the corresponding <w> analysis to a <note> marker.\nA sample derivation is shown for the preposition phrase \u0628\u062a\u0627\u0643 \u0639\u0645 \u2018with a writer\u2019. The XRAM analyzer outputs one analysis for \u0639\u0645 (the output by the XRAM system reformats a subsets of information in AM and is in the form vocalized_form/lemma/pos):\nmaEa/maEa_1/PREP\nwhile three analyses are yielded for \u0628\u062a\u0627\u0643:\n1) kAtab+a/kAtab_1/V 2) kAtib/kAtib_1/N 3) kAtib/kAtib_2/A\nAnalysis #1 is filtered out by RE rule (* \u0639\u0645 V), while the LM component ranks #2 over #3. This is the result fragment in XML notation:\n<w ana=\"maEa/maEa_1/PREP\"> \u0639\u0645 </w> <w ana=\"kAtib/kAtib_1/N\">\n<note ana=\"kAtib/kAtib_2/A\"/> \u0628\u062a\u0627\u0643\n</w>\nThe fragment shows the unique analysis for \u0639\u0645 and the top ranked analysis for \u0628\u062a\u0627\u0643 encoded in the \u2018ana\u2019 attribute of the <w> tag, while the alternative analysis for \u0628\u062a\u0627\u0643 is encoded as a note. If the annotator does prefer one of the alternative analysis, (s)he adds the attribute \u2018ed=\"correct\"\u2019 to it:\n<w ana=\"kAtib/kAtib_1/N\"> <note ana=\"kAtib/kAtib_2/A\" ed=\"correct\"/> \u0628\u062a\u0627\u0643 </w>\nand launches the XLST transformation which reverses the selection:\n<w ana=\"kAtib/kAtib_2/A\"> <note ana=\"kAtib/kAtib_1/N\"/> \u0628\u062a\u0627\u0643 </w>"}, {"heading": "2.4 Semi-automatic increment of lexical coverage", "text": "One of the weak points of AraMorph is the limited range of text genres on which the resource was based: the lexicon files as well as the compatibility tables included in the program are mostly based on newspaper texts and other Modern Standard Arabic non-literary texts, which largely comprise the LDC Arabic corpus. The program is not only unbalanced and representative of a limited part of the Arabic vocabulary, but its look up lists lack of any stylistic and chronological information as well. Because of this, various problems can arise from the analysis of other textual genres, especially Classical and both contemporary formal and informal ones. Analyses conducted on Preislamic and Classical texts, such as Hadith texts (Boella et al., 2011) reveal that the main weak points of AM are:\n(i) the rejection or the wrong analysis of words such as the \u2019\u0101- interrogative prefix, as well as imperative verbs that are not included in AM due to their rare occurrence in targeted AM texts. In\naddition, other errors that occur with classical Arabic corpora, especially pre-Islamic, concern broken plurals as well as certain verb stems (mainly of, ma\u1e63dars, participles, quadrilitteral verbs, iussive verbs, passives) which are either uncommon, as in the case of the quadrilitteral \u0630\u0630\u0646\u062e\u062a (see Table 1), or are written in a nonstandard form not recognized by the analyzer, for example with the suk\u016bn on the last letter. Note that when dealing with poetry there are other metrical phenomenon that are not recognized by the analyzer such as the \u2018alif or the y\u0101\u2019 followed by the ha\u2019 at the end of the verse to create a rhyme (this was found when inserting the poetical works, or D\u012bw\u0101n, of the pre-Islamic poetess Al-\u1e2aans\u0101\u2019 as a corpus in the analyzer);\n(ii) the risk of false positives due to the presence of contemporary named entities inside the AM lexical lists, which are included in the search even when a classical text is analyzed (the same point has already been approached and partially overcome within in the above mentioned Boella et al., 2011).\nOn the other hand, for contemporary formal texts among newspapers and novels as well as contemporary informal texts such as blogs and social networks, one of the most important problems is the lack of a graphemic standardization of:\n(iii) transliterated foreign words that nowadays Arabic borrows especially from English and arranges phonetically according to dialect and idiosyncratic varieties, which influence their transcription2. Among these types there are not only proper nouns of people and places but also commune nouns (for some examples see Table 1);\n(iv) dialect words which are also exposed to a strong idiosyncratic variety when they are transcribed (for some examples see Table 1).\nThus, the XRAM project aims at enhancing the AM through the inclusion of additional lists of prefixes, stems and suffixes with the relative combination tables, in order to face points (i), (iii) and (iv). Several parts of the above mentioned lists will be automatically extracted from Arabic lexical resources currently available in XML format. For Classical texts, one of the most important resources is Salmon\u00e9\u2019s ArabicEnglish dictionary (1889), which is entirely encoded according to TEI standards and\n2 As of matter of the Egyptian variety, Rosenbaum (2014) defines this linguistic phenomenon \u201cEgyptianized English\u201d.\ndownloadable in a XML file. As for transliterated foreign words a solution is proposed by cross checking the concerned items with Arabic Wikipedia that is one of the largest online encyclopedia in existence and its large list of named entities has already inspired projects meant to potentiate and expand other Arabic lexical resources like Arabic WordNet (Alkhalifa and Rodriguez, 2010).
