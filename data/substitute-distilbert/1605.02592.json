After publication, it was observed that the weight needed to be re-tuned as the number of references changed. With more references, more variations of the sentence are seen which results in a larger set of reference n-grams. Larger sets of reference n-grams tend to have higher overlap with the source ngrams, which decreases the number of n-grams that were seen in the source but not the reference. Because of this, the penalty term decreases and a large weight is needed for the penalty term to have the same magnitude as the penalty when there are fewer references.\nAs re-tuning the weight for different sized reference sets is undesirable, we simplified GLEU so that there is no tuning needed and the metric is\n1Download available at https://github.com/ cnap/gec-ranking/.\n2Not to be confused with the method of the same name presented in Mutton et al.

As originally presented, in computing n-gram precision, GLEU doublecounts n-grams in the reference that do not appear in the source, and it subtracts a weighted count of n-grams that appear in the source (S) and not the reference (R). We use a modified version, GLEU+, that simplifies this. Precision is simply the number of reference n-gram matches, minus the counts of n-grams found more often in the source than the reference (Equation 1). GLEU+ follows the same intuition as the original GLEU: overlap between S and R should be rewarded and n-grams that should have been changed in S but were not should be penalized.\nThe precision term in Equation 1 is then used in the standard BLEU equation (Papineni et al., 2002) to get the GLEU+ score. Because the number of possible reference n-grams increases as more reference sets are used, we calculate an intermediate GLEU+ by randomly sample from one of the references for each sentence, and report the mean score over 500 iterations. It takes less than 30 seconds to evaluate 1,000 sentences using 500 iterations."}, {"heading": "3 Results", "text": "Using this revised version of GLEU, we calculated the scores for each system submitted to the CoNLL 2014\u2013Shared Task on Grammatical Error Correction3 to update the results reported in Tables 4 and 5 of Napoles et al.

The system ranking by GLEU+ is compared to the originally reported GLEU (GLEU0), M2, and the human ranking (Table 1).\n3http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/\u02dcnlp/ conll14st.html\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n02 59\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 9\nM ay\n2 01\n6\nOn average, M2 ranks systems within 3.4 places of the human ranking. Both GLEU scores have closer rankings on average: GLEU0 within 2.6 and GLEU+ within 2.9 places of the human ranking.\nThe correlation between the system scores and the human ranking is shown in Table 2.
