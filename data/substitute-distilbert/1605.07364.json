In this work, the bacteria foraging algorithm (BFA) was employed in tandem with four random generators (stochastic engines). The stochastic engines operate using the Weibull distribution, Gamma distribution, Gaussian distribution and a chaotic mechanism. The two non-Gaussian distributions are the Weibull and Gamma distributions. In this work, the approaches developed were implemented on the real-world multi-objective resin bonded sand mould problem. The Pareto frontiers obtained were benchmarked using two metrics; the hyper volume indicator (HVI) and the proposed Average Explorative Rate (AER) metric.

This is mainly due to its effectiveness in the search process and its efficiency in terms of computational time [1]. Some of the most common SI-based approaches are particle swarm optimization (PSO) [2], cuckoo search (CS) [3], ant colony optimization (ACO) [4] and bacterial foraging algorithm (BFA) [5]. In the past, one of the most popular techniques employed for solving constrained nonlinear optimization problems is PSO [2]. However, in recent times other strategies such as BFA have become attractive for this purpose. BFA\u2019s computational performance has been proven to as good as and at times better than other SI\u2019s as well evolutionary techniques [6]. Inspired by the natural behaviour of the E.Coli bacterium searching for nutrients in the environment, Pasino [5] proposed the BFA for solving complex optimization problems. The central premise of this approach is that the bacteria tries to maximize its energy per unit time spent during foraging for nutrients while simultaneously evading noxious substances.\nOver the past years, many research works has been centred on resin bonded sand mould systems (cold box moulding process) due to its adaptive capabilities in a dynamics environment, its compliance to environmental factors and its high casting quality [7]. This approach is extremely power-saving when it comes to large-scale or mass production [8]. In most cases, resin bonded sand mould systems have excellent flow behaviour. Nevertheless some introduction of vibration and compaction during the moulding process is required. Casting properties are very much influenced by the mould properties (which are in effect dependent on the process parameters during mould development process) [9]. In this work, the multiobjective (MO) optimization model employed for the resin bonded sand system was developed in Surekha et al. [10]. This model was based on a resin bonded sand system where phenol formaldehyde was used as binder and tetrahydrophtalic anhydride was used as a hardener [10]. Since in\nthis work, the problem formulation is MO in nature, the computational technique (BFA) is incorporated with the weighted-sum framework. Using this approach, multiple solutions are obtained for various weights which are then utilized to construct the Pareto frontier.\nMost metaheuristic algorithms are endowed with a stochastic engine that generates random values which diversifies the algorithm\u2019s search space. These stochastic engines also provide the algorithm with a \u2018warm-start\u2019 prior to the searching process. Therefore, the type of probability distribution function (PDF) that generates the random value in the stochastic engine heavily influences the algorithm\u2019s search capability. In most metaheuristic algorithms, the stochastic engine produces random numbers following a Gaussian PDF [11,12]. In other cases, researchers have employed other approaches to enhance the stochastic engine by using chaos-based functions to couple with the Gaussian PDF [13]. These approaches avoid the algorithm from getting stuck in the local optima which causes premature algorithmic convergence [14]. Thus, stochastic engines play a crucial role in the implementation of metaheuristics. Besides Gaussian stochastic engines, another distribution that has rarely been investigated with respect to metaheuristics are the non-Gaussian distributions. These are usually heavy-tailed distributions, for instance distributors [15-18]. It has been known that many real-world systems (engineering, chemical or economic systems) do not behave in a stochastically Gaussian manner but are prone to contain non-Gaussian fluctuations. Thus the primary aim of this work is to analyse the effects of non-Gaussian stochastic engines on the performance of metaheuristics when implemented in a\nVolume 4 \u2022 Issue 5 \u2022 1000182Ind Eng Manage ISSN: 2169-0316, IEM an open access journal\nreal-world engineering problem. In this work, the influence of the three types of stochastic engines (which are chaos-based, Gaussian-type PDF and Non-Gaussian-type PDF [19]) on the multi objective optimization of the resin-bonded sand mould system. These approaches are compared and discussed in detail. These procedures are executed by the implementation of the BFA technique."}, {"heading": "Model Characteristics", "text": "In Surekha et al.

Strictly Pareto-compliant can be defined such that if there exists two solution sets to a particular MO problem, then the solution set that dominates the other would a higher indicator value. The HVI measures the volume of the dominated section of the objective space and can be applied for multi-dimensional scenarios. When using the HVI, a reference point needs to be defined. Relative to this point, the volume of the space of all dominated solutions can be measured. The HVI of a solution set xd \u2208 X can be defined as follows:\n1\n1 1 ( ,... )\n( ) [ , ] ...

The tumbling mode allows bacterium motion in a fixed direction while the tumbling mode enables the bacterium to augment its search direction accordingly. Applied in tandem, these two modes give the bacterium capability to stochastically move towards a sufficient source of nutrient. Thus, computationally chemotaxis is presented as follows:\n( )( 1, , , ) ( , , , ) ( ) ( ) ( ) i i T ij k l m j k l m C i i i \u03b8 \u03b8 \u2206+ = + \u2206 \u2206\n(13)\nwhere ( 1, , , )j j k l m\u03b8 + is the ith bacterium at the jth chemotactic step, kth swarming step and lth reproductive step and mth elimination-dispersal step. C(i) is the size of the step taken in a random direction which is fixed by the tumble, and [ 1,1]\u2206\u2208 \u2212 is the random vector.\nIn the swarming phase, the bacterium communicates to the entire swarm regarding the nutrient profile it mapped during its movement. The communication method adopted by the bacterium is cell-to-cell signalling. In E. Coli bacteria, aspartate is released by the cells if it is exposed to high amounts of succinate. This causes the bacteria to conglomerate into groups and hence move in a swarm of high bacterial density. The swarming phase is mathematically presented as follows:\n( ) ( )2 2 1 1 1 1\n( , ( , , , )) exp( exp( S P S P\ni i att att m m rep rep m m\ni m i m J P j k l m D W H W\u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 = = = =        = \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 + \u2212 \u2212 \u2212        \u2211 \u2211 \u2211 \u2211 (14)\nwhere ( , ( , , , ))J P j k l m\u03b8 is the computed dynamic objective function value (not the real objective function in the problem), S is the total number of bacteria, P is the number of variables to be optimized (embedded in each bacterium), Hrep, Wrep, Hatt, and Watt are userdefined parameters.\nDuring reproduction, the healthy bacteria or the bacteria which are successful in securing a high degree of nutrients are let to reproduce asexually by splitting into two. Bacteria which do not manage to perform according to the specified criteria are eliminated from the group and thus not allowed to reproduce causing their genetic propagation (in this case their foraging strategies) to come to a halt. Due to this cycle, the amount of individual bacterium in the swarm remains constant throughout the execution of the BFA.\nCatastrophic events in an environment (such as a sudden change in physical/chemical properties or rapid decrease in nutrient content) can effect in death to a population of bacteria. Such events can cause bacteria to be killed and some to be randomly dispersed to different locations in the objective space. These events which are set to occur in the elimination/dispersal phase help to maintain swarm diversity to make sure the search operation is efficient.

The BFA technique equipped with the Gaussian, Weibull and Gamma distributions are termed G-BFA, W-BFA and \u03b3 -BFA respectively while the BFA coupled with the chaotic generator is called the Ch-BFA. The solution sets generated by the BFA variants are employed to construct the approximate Pareto frontier. For the approximation of the Pareto frontier, 53 solutions for various weights were obtained for each of the BFA variants employed in this work. The quality of these solution sets was measured using the HVI. The nadir point employed as a reference in the HVI is (q1, q2, q3, q4) = (0, 0, 0, 0). In this work, since the approaches are stochastic in nature, each solution point is selected by taking the best solution obtained from 10 independent runs of the algorithms (for each of the individual weights). The individual solutions for specific weights of the BFA variants were gauged based on the value of the aggregate objective function (weighted-sum approach) given as follows:\n[1,4] i i i F w f \u2200 \u2208 = \u2211 (19)\nwhere F is the aggregate objective function, fi are the individual objective functions and wi are the respective weights. This way the best, median and worst solution was determined. The individual solutions for the G-BFA approach and their aggregate objective values are as in Table 2.\nThe associated weights (w1, w2, w3, w4) for the best, median and worst solution are (0.1, 0.7, 0.1, 0.1), (0.5, 0.1, 0.3, 0.1) and (0.1, 0.1, 0.7, 0.1). The approximate Pareto frontier obtained using the G-BFA approach is shown in Figure 1. The individual solutions for the W-BFA approach and their aggregate objective values are as in Table 3 and Figure 2 provides depiction of the approximate Pareto frontier obtained using the W-BFA approach. The associated weights (w1, w2, w3, w4) for the best, median and worst solution provided by the W-BFA approach (refer to Table 2) are (0.1, 0.7, 0.1, 0.1), (0.5, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2) and (0.1, 0.1, 0.7, 0.1). The individual solutions for the \u03b3 -BFA approach and their respective values of the aggregate objective functions are shown in Table 4. The associated weights (w1, w2, w3, w4) for the best, median and worst solutions produced by \u03b3-BFA approach are (0.7, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1), (0.1, 0.4, 0.2, 0.3) and (0.1, 0.1, 0.6, 0.2). The approximate Pareto frontier obtained using the \u03b3 -BFA approach is shown in Figure 3.\nThe individual solutions for the Ch-BFA variant and their aggregate objective values are as in Table 5 and Figure 4 shows the approximate Pareto frontier obtained using the Ch-BFA approach.\nThe associated weights (w1, w2, w3, w4) for the best, median and worst solutions produced by Ch-BFA approach are (0.1, 0.7, 0.1, 0.1), (0.1, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2) and (0.1, 0.1, 0.7, 0.1). The degree of dominance for the entire Pareto frontiers produced by all four BFA variants is presented in Figure 5.\nIn Figure 5, it can be observed that the W-BFA generates the most dominant Pareto frontier followed by the G-BFA, Ch-BFA and \u03b3 -BFA respectively. The frontier obtained using the W-BFA approach is more dominant than G-BFA, Ch-BFA and \u03b3-BFA by 6.156%, 38.385% and 71.394% respectively. It can be observed in Figure 2 that the frontier\nVolume 4 \u2022 Issue 5 \u2022 1000182Ind Eng Manage ISSN: 2169-0316, IEM an open access journal\nproduced by the W-BFA is localized at the most optimal regions in the objective space. The G-BFA and the Ch-BFA generates solution set which are highly localized in certain regions (Figures 1 and 4). Thus, these approaches have very limited solution coverage which thus affects the overall dominance of the Pareto frontier. The \u03b3 -BFA on the other hand has a wide spread of solutions and hence high area of coverage (Figure 3). However, the solutions produced by the \u03b3-BFA are not located on the optimal or dominant regions of the objective space. It can be seen\nin this work that wide coverage of solutions on the Pareto frontier is a critical criteria for Pareto dominance. Nevertheless, if the solutions are not located in the dominant/optimal regions in the objective space, the overall frontier may not be the highly dominant albeit widely spread. Throughout these executions, the Ch-BFA does not perform well as compared to the (Table 5 and Figure 5) \u03b3-BFA and the W-BFA. Thus, it is clear that for this problem the chaotic component in the stochastic engine does not improve the performance of the metaheuristic\nVolume 4 \u2022 Issue 5 \u2022 1000182Ind Eng Manage ISSN: 2169-0316, IEM an open access journal\napproach. Each of the solutions generated BFA variants are ranked based on the aggregate objective function value as in Tables 2-5. Table 6 shows the best individual solution produced by each of the BFA variants. Similar to the degree of dominance of the entire Pareto frontier, the W-BFA produces outranks the all the other BFA variants in terms of best individual solution. The W-BFA outranks the \u03b3 -BFA, G-BFA and Ch-BFA by 32.857%, 8.538% and 22.113% respectively. From Table 6 and Figure 5, the dominance rankings of the Pareto frontier and the individual solution rankings produced by the BFA variants\nare synchronous. The computational time of the approaches employed in this work was not compared. This is because all the approaches employed here are BFA-based and they only vary in terms of their stochastic engines which do not significantly contribute to their computational complexity. Therefore comparative analysis related to computational complexity and computational time of the approaches is not investigated in this work. The proposed AER metric was utilized to measure the rate of exploration carried out by each of the approaches. The values of the obtained AER are shown in Figure 6.\nVolume 4 \u2022 Issue 5 \u2022 1000182Ind Eng Manage ISSN: 2169-0316, IEM an open access journal\nIn Figure 6, the AER values are observed to be at maximal for the W-BFA approach followed by the Ch-BFA and the G-BFA. The lowest AER value was produced by the -BFA. It can be seen the AER value is related to the degree of dominance determined by the HVI (Figure 5). The W-BFA produces the most dominant Pareto frontier and the highest AER value. Similarly the Pareto frontier generated by the \u03b3 -BFA has the lowest dominance and the lowest AER value while Ch-BFA and the G-BFA fall into the middle rank when measured with both the metrics. Thus, the explorative rate clearly indicates the\neffectiveness of the approach in terms of obtaining optimal solutions which construct dominant Pareto frontiers. The AER can thus be employed as an online metric to gauge and increase the adaptability of the approach during execution.\nIn this work, the weighted-sum scalarization approach was employed to construct the Pareto frontier from solutions with various weightages. Although the weighted sum approach is very apt for Pareto frontier construction in multi-objective scenarios, this approach fails to guarantee Pareto optimality [32]. Scalarization techniques such as the weighted-sum approach are incapable to accurately approximate Pareto frontiers which are concavely shaped. Since this problem is a maximization problem, the nadir point was chosen such that all the solution points obtained dominate this point. This makes the benchmarking results obtained using the HVI independent of the choice of the nadir point.\nAll the BFA-based computational approaches employed in this work performed stable computations during program executions. All solution points obtained using the approaches were feasible and no constraint violations occurred. One of the advantages of the BFA approach is that it performs a very thorough search since it has many cascaded loops (chemotaxis, swarming, reproduction and eliminationdispersal. Since this increases the computational complexity of the BFA approach, the negative impact on the execution time is inevitable."}, {"heading": "Outlook", "text": "The introduction of the non-Gaussian approach in the conventional stochastic engine has shown very interesting results. It can be observed in Table 5 and Figure 6 that the W-BFA which is equipped with a NonGaussian stochastic engine outranks all the other approaches employed in this work in terms of individual solution and degree of Pareto frontier dominance. However, the \u03b3 -BFA does not perform as well the W-BFA or the conventional G-BFA although it is equipped with a nonGaussian stochastic engine as well. These results show that although having a non-Gaussian stochastic engine may be advantageous, it is possible that the choice of non-Gaussian distribution employed in the solution method may be dependent on the type of solution landscape. Due to this dependence, the effectiveness of the computational approach with a particular type of non-Gaussian stochastic engine would vary based on the problem characteristics and type.\nThe proposed AER metric was observed to provide good correlation with the measurements employed in this work. In future works, the AER metric could be employed in more computational approaches as an effective tool to direct the search effectively during program execution. In addition, other types of non-Gaussian distributions such the Gumbel distribution [15] could be tested as a stochastic engine in other types of metaheuristics (e.g., evolutionary algorithms:\nVolume 4 \u2022 Issue 5 \u2022 1000182Ind Eng Manage ISSN: 2169-0316, IEM an open access journal\nGenetic Programming [33] and Differential Evolution [12]). Besides, more real-world multiobjective problems should be explored using computational techniques with non-Gaussian stochastic engines to investigate and validate the effectiveness of this framework in solving optimization problems."}], "references": [{"title": "Biomimicry of social foraging bacteria for distributed optimization: Models, principles, and emergent behaviors", "author": ["Y Liu", "KM Passino", "MA Simaan"], "venue": "Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications", "citeRegEx": "1", "shortCiteRegEx": "1", "year": 2002}, {"title": "Particle Swarm Optimization", "author": ["J Kennedy", "R Eberhart"], "venue": "IEEE Proceedings of the International Conference on Neural Networks: Perth, Australia", "citeRegEx": "2", "shortCiteRegEx": "2", "year": 1995}, {"title": "Cuckoo search algorithm for the selection of optimal machining parameters in milling", "author": ["AR Yildiz"], "venue": "operations.

This work investigates the effects of non-Gaussian stochastic engines on the performance of metaheuristics when solving a real-world optimization problem. In this work, the bacteria foraging algorithm (BFA) was employed in tandem with four random generators (stochastic engines). The stochastic engines operate using the Weibull distribution, Gamma distribution, Gaussian distribution and a chaotic mechanism. The two non-Gaussian distributions are the Weibull and Gamma distributions. In this work, the approaches developed were implemented on the real-world multi-objective resin bonded sand mould problem. The Pareto frontiers obtained were benchmarked using two metrics; the hyper volume indicator (HVI) and the proposed Average Explorative Rate (AER) metric.
