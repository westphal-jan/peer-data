The trust issues become prominent due to a complexity of international relations in digital world. To explore the trust issues, we have investigated existing literatures that discuss trust (e.g. definition, formalism and theory) and international relations. From an observation in the literatures, we found none of the existing literatures discussed a calculus model for the international relations. Many literatures in politics and social sciences discussed the trust and international relations in philosophical forms which are subject to ambiguity of natural languages (J.Wheeler, 2012; Jelenc and Tr\u010dek, 2014; Mcknight and Chervany, 2001). A few literatures in computer science and applied mathematics discuss trust as mathematical models (Hallerstede et al., 2014; J\u00f8sang, 1997). However, the trust mathematical models in existing literatures are too general and it is not sufficient to be used in modeling the trust issues in international nation relations. Probabilistic theories in trust modeling work such as Bayesian, Dempster-Shafer, Josang\u2019s subjective logic (Abdel-hafez, 2013; Dempster, 1967; J\u00f8sang, 2013) that do not directly address the trust issues for international relations. A brief discussion regarding the previous literatures and its related theories are discussed in the Literature Review section. In this work, we model the international relations between nations using a calculus model, which we call a relation algebra. The proposed method will allow a relation computation, which is previously subjective and incomputable.\nIn our previous works (Mohd Anuar Mat Isa et al., 2012a, 2012b), we have mentioned the need for a \u201ctrust model\u201d in Common Criteria (CC). Trust is an important element to ensure Common Criteria\u2019s participant nations are able to recognize and consume Common Criteria\u2019s products. Our previous work motivation is influenced by Kallberg\u2019s suggestion that \u201cthe long-term survival of CC requires abandoning the global approach and instead use established groupings of trust\u201d (Kallberg, 2012). We also mentioned about game theory as a strategic decision-making engine to evaluate the trust model. However, our preceding publications did not describe the implementation of relation algebra for international nation relations model. This publication covers the relation algebra for international nation relations model. The aim of this work is to propose the relation algebra for relation computations and trust modeling in the international nation relations. The proposed relation\nalgebra is then evaluated using case studies. The proposed relation algebra will provide mathematical evaluations of international relations between nations.\nThe outline of this paper is a follows: Our research motivations and objectives are presented in Motivation section, while Literature Review section examinations literature related to trust and international relations. The research methodology for the relation algebra is described in Methodology section. We then explain the relation algebra method, definition and notation in Trust Algebra section. In Case Study section, we test the relation algebra using public data (e.g. internet and research literature) as case studies for the international nation relations. We provide results and discussions of the case studies in Result and Discussion sections, while our research contributions and future works in Contribution and Future Work section. Finally, Conclusion section summarizes this research works."}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "In this section, trust definitions and its modeling works will be discussed in the sub-sections. Trust Relation Definition\nThe keyword \u201ctrust\u201d and \u201crelation\u201d provide many definitions in various disciplines. Searching the keywords in a search engine reveals varieties of trust definitions. The definitions can be linked to economy and political science studies in the earliest stage of trust definition. Later the definitions have evolved due to its expansion in computer science studies. A trust relation definition in the social science can be categorized as an expectation about other motives in a specific situation or state (Mcknight and Chervany, 1996). This definition is rooted in relationships between two entities (trustor and trustee); a willingness to be vulnerable or taking a risk (Schoorman et al., 2007); a belief or faith about honesty (Mcknight and Chervany, 2001, 1996), benevolence of another entities in relationships (Porta and Scazzieri, 1997); and an experience and knowledge that are cultivated over time between entities (Jiang et al., 2015; Kydd, 2005).\nIn this paragraph, we focus on trust relation definitions that are related to international relations which are the main theme in this publication. Trust can be defined as a clustering of perception (White, 1992); an optimism about trustworthiness of others in mutual beneficial relations (Hardin, 1992); an expression of people in evaluating others in any given society and its evaluation will be affected based on changes in the external world (Newton, 2001); and a trust level can be mapped to the amount of risk one is willing to take in relations (Schoorman et al., 2007). A variety of trust quotations from the international relations literatures are:\n\u201cTrust is the key to international cooperation\u201d (McGillivray and Smith, 2000). \u201cIf negative peace and its three subcategories (fragile, unstable, and cold peace) are defined by the absence of war, then positive peace is defined by the presence of confidence and trust \u2026 there seems to be agreement that alliances and international treaties, at least by themselves, provide at best only thin grounds for true and long-lasting mutual understanding \u2026 the key is to be found in what more identifies as missing from alliances\u2014mutual confidence and trust\u201d (Oelsner, 2007). \u201cTrust can change over time \u2026 when the states\u2019 national security interests are at stake and their chain of considerations becomes more selfish and focused on protecting their own interest.\u201d (Kallberg, 2012).\nComputer science literatures rely on the political and social sciences literatures for the trust relation definitions. The only difference that, researchers in the computer science (or applied mathematics) try to represent (or formalize) the ambiguousness of \u201ctrust\u201d and \u201crelation\u201d definitions in nature languages into a scientific and practical approach for a computation. A formalism of the relation computation is rooted to probability studies. In earlier stages, Bayes\u2019s probability and Dempster-Shaffer theory (Shafer, 1976) were used in belief function for the relation computation. Later, a subjective logic (J\u00f8sang, 2013, 2001) is introduced as a formalism for the relation computation in computer science. An expansion to the subjective logic was offered by (Tr\u010dek, 2009) for a trust modeling (e.g. trust operators) in computer networks such as trust management in web services, social networks, e-voting, etc. As a conclusion to the trust definitions in the computer science, computer scientists do not define or redefine the trust definitions, it provides a methodology (Tr\u010dek, 2009) for the relation computation and its statistical inferences."}, {"heading": "Trust Modeling", "text": "Referring to the previous section, there are many trust definitions that were expressed in natural languages. To enable relation computation in computing systems, the trust definitions need to be conveyed in a measurable or quantifiable notations such as statistical representations. The first attempt to represent trust in the statistical notations was by (Dempster, 1967). Dempster showed a probability measurement that is to define an upper and lower probabilities for a multivalued mapping. The probability measurement is a generalization of calculus in Bayesian theory. His statistical scheme is adopted by (Shafer, 1979, 1976) and it provides elegant method to compute trust. Many researchers later (in 1980-1995) addressed both works as the foundation for a concrete relation computation, which they began to call as Dempster-Shafer theory in the early 1980s (Shafer, 2015). Later (J\u00f8sang, 1997) provided an extension to a probabilistic calculus for the\nDempster-Shaper theory by introducing an artificial reasoning, named subjective logic. The following subsections will further discuss the Bayesian theory, Dempster-Shafer theory and subjective logic."}, {"heading": "Bayesian Theory", "text": "The Bayesian theory is widely used in probability studies such as statistical inference. The statistical inference is a process to deduce a conclusion from given hypotheses using data that were sampled from a population. Through the statistical inference, a probability of the hypotheses to be either true, false or unknown can be derived using Bayesian probability. The Bayesian probability can be computed using Bayesian inference (or rule). The Bayesian inference allows an update to a probability of a given hypothesis when a new evidence was found. It is contributed to a non-monotonic logic (Brewka, 1992) that allows a tentative conclusion (previously deduced conclusion) to be retracted when the new evidence invalidates the tentative conclusion. This formal logic is used in an artificial intelligent (AI) study for a decision making when past experiences and new experiences are accumulated. In the AI literature, this work is called belief revision (Wobcke, 1995). Below is the Bayes\u2019s theorem that is used as an inference rule for belief computation as well as belief update.\n\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3b|\ud835\udc37) = \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc37|\ud835\udc3b) \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc3b)\n\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc37)\nWhere P(H|D) is a posterior probability 1 of hypothesis H after datum D is observed.

P(D|H) is a probability of datum D given that hypothesis H is true."}, {"heading": "Dempster-Shafer Theory", "text": "The theory is also known as the theory of belief function. In the Bayesian theory, each question of interests (or events) requires probabilities that are assigned to each of them. The belief function (Shafer, 1976) measures a degree of belief (or mass) for one question using subjective probability for a related question. The degree of belief may not bound to mathematical probabilities and its probabilities depending on how closely questions (or events) are related. The belief for one question can be combined using Dempster\u2019s rule that when the question relies on independent items of evidence.\nThe belief function will assign a mass for every hypothesis (or question of interests). A total mass is a measurement of the entire evidence (or a belief of given hypothesis H). The total mass that supports the given hypothesis H will form a lower bound of belief. Plausibility (\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc59) is a total mass measurement of the entire evidence that contradicts to the given hypothesis H. The plausibility is an upper bound of the given hypothesis H would be true.

Each belief is represented as a collection of opinions in a finite state space2. The opinions may contain a degree of uncertainty about its probability (J\u00f8sang, 2013).

The authors have argued that a punishment for those defect the international cooperation can be used to make partner nations become more honest and trustworthy. (Mcknight and Chervany, 2001, 1996) revisited a trust and distrust definitions where they collected numerous trust definitions across multiple disciplines since 1970. Based on their findings, they proposed two topologies to represent trust: i) a classification system to determine types of trust; and ii) a trust model that can be derived from definitions of six related trust types (e.g. trusting intention, trusting behavior, trusting beliefs, system trust, disposition trust, and situational and decisional to trust). (J\u00f8sang, 2001) proposed a new opinion metric to represent Dempster-Shafer\u2019s belief model with a demonstration of uncertainty and its probability. The author has introduced a subjective logic to represent the opinion metric using standard and non-standard logical operators (e.g. consensus operator that is used for combining evidence between two parties opinion). (Newton, 2001) explored an empirical relationship between a social and political trust. The author\u2019s suggestion is to evaluate trust at a society level with consideration of external world factors rather than just an individual level. A performance of government (e.g. corruption,\n2 In the original literature, it was called a frame of discernment. In this work, we have simplified many notations for ease of reader to grasp the basic ideas of the original literature.\n3 A priori probability is a probability that is deduced from current evidence without concerning other factors that may directly or indirectly affect a given proposition such as perceptions, past experiences, insight, etc. The probability is presumed in the absence of further evidence.\neconomy, crime, unemployment) will indicate its trustworthiness to a society because it will affect everyone. Therefore, to evaluate the political trust; trust assessments and aggregation analyzes should be done at the society level.\n(Kydd, 2005) debated about roles of trust and mistrust in international relations as well as its effects in the Cold War. The author has shortened a trust definition as a belief that another entity is trustworthy and willing to establish cooperation; and mistrust is a belief that another entity is untrustworthy with the intention to exploit the cooperation. A nation with a sufficient trust can increase a positive relation with other nations and it can also benefit to reduce conflicts. To enable the cooperation, each participant entity must exceed a minimal trust threshold that allows the participant entities to begin the cooperation. The author has showed that the minimal trust threshold for the trust and mistrust in the international relations can be evaluated using game theory (e.g. prisoner\u2019s dilemma). An example of security dilemma by the authors:\n\u201cInsecure states will pursue power to make themselves more secure; this renders other states less secure, and their efforts to catch up in turn render the first state less secure in a vicious circle. International conflict is a tragic clash between states with fundamentally benign desires to survive.\u201d\n(Golbeck, 2006) defined a set of properties that can be used to express trust relationships in social networks. (Oelsner, 2007) criticized that a regional peace is not enough to enable regional friendships. The author has categorized the regional peace into two parts: negative peace (e.g. fragile peace, unstable peace, cold or conditional peace) and positive peace (e.g. stable peace and pluralistic security community). Some of trust and distrust properties were stated in their works. The properties will affect the international nation relationships such as recent war, deployment troop in a border, diplomatic visit, antipathy between societies, arms races, join project, people mobility nuclear program and treaty, economic cooperation, etc. (Martinelli and Petrocchi, 2007) defined an integrated framework for modeling of security and trust. (Yan and Holtmanns, 2007) discussed a transformation of social trust into a digital trust that can be used in trust modeling and trust management. (Walter et al., 2008) presented a trust model using recommendation system in a social network. The authors have used multi-agents to find a trust relationship using friend\u2019s recommendations. The trust agents were used to keep track of trust values in a communication. (Biskup et al., 2008) proposed trust modalities that are based on correlations between certified properties, experiences and expectations in a control and access decision. (Tr\u010dek, 2008) summarized collection trust definitions by the previous literature. The most remarkable trust definition that is related to this research work: \u201cTrust is a subjective probability by which an individual expects that another individual performs\u2026\u201d (reliability trust) and \u201cTrust is the extent to which one party is willing to depend on something or somebody in given situation \u2026 even though negative consequences are possible.\u201d (decision trust). (Tr\u010dek, 2009) proposed a formalism of trust model using a taxonomy of generic model and a qualitative algebra. The qualitative algebra is used for model definitions and to transform it into algebraic forms (formal representation). It includes basic quantitative methodologies for modeling trust relations such as trusted, untrusted and undecided. The authors have showed that the trust relations can be modeled based on these properties: not reflexive, not symmetric, non-transitive and commutative (for fully connected society). The proposed trust model was tested in web services for an automated trust management applications (Jelenc and Tr\u010dek, 2014; Tr\u010dek, 2011).\nKallberg (Kallberg, 2012) identified trust as an element that is important to ensure that members of Common Criteria are able to recognize and consume Common Criteria\u2019s certified products and services. He has argued that \u201c long-term survival of CC requires abandoning the global approach and instead use established groupings of trust\u201d. His major suggestion is to use a customized group of Common Criteria that based on mutual interest such as defense alliance, economic cooperation agreements, historical events, and political alliances; because it conveys transitive trust between its partners. The author has viewed the Common Criteria concerns from the perspective of relationships and trust boundaries between nations, which he considered as major issues. He has proposed \u201cgroup of trust\u201d as a trivial solution for these problems (Koster et al., 2012) proposed a trust alignment that can be used for finding a translation of the other agent\u2019s trust evaluations using shared evidence. The authors\u2019 assumption that a shared information can be observed by participant agents. (J.Wheeler, 2012) studied challenges and clarifications in building trust relationships for international relations when conflict situations happened. The author has discussed diversity trust relationships from the origin of trust definitions, identification of mistrust issues in the international relations, and the challenges that are to sustain and improve the trust relationships. An example of internal issues regarding civil nuclear technology between India and Pakistan (1999-2002) was also discussed that is either for peaceful or militarization (defensive to offensive) purpose \u2013 nuclear dilemmas for leaders\u2019 interpretation and response between India and Pakistan. He also mentioned that an ideology conviction for a nation can imply bad faith thinking for trust-building to another nation (e.g. Cold War: US (capitalism, liberal democracy) and the Soviet Union (socialism, communist Marxism\u2013Leninism, totalitarianism). The ideology conviction was also to be claimed to be the cause of bad relations between India-Pakistan, Israel-Palestine (Eldad, 2013) and Iran-US. (Rohner et al., 2012) proposed a theory that is to study trust and conflict with correspondence to an international trade. The authors\u2019 argument that, business relationships (e.g. international trade) will be disrupted if two nations struggle in soft or hard conflicts. The conflict will render trust and it will cause scant trade between the struggled nations. The authors\u2019 suggestion that, an inverse relation such that if we are increase trust in trader communities by means of foster the trade activities, then it will decrease\nthe conflict between the struggled nations. The suggestion is consistent with a well-known theory (e.g. rational-agent theory) and its prediction of a negative correlation between war and trust.\n(Yu et al., 2015) analyzed bilateral trade patterns in 16 European countries between years 1996 to 2009. The authors found that when there is an imbalance of importing and exporting rule and regulations between importer country and exporter country, the effect of trust on trade will be changed consequently. For example, a tight importing rule and regulations will reduce the trust of the exporter country toward to the importing country. (Bansal and Mariam, 2015) studied the effect of privacy violation and its correlation to a trust violation and repair in a security breach. The authors have explored the security breach problem such as leaking of users\u2019 privacy data and how an information security officer that responsible to the security breach will response to the user. (Fang et al., 2015) addressed multi-facets of trust issues in social sciences (Svetlana and Tzukanova, 2016). The authors\u2019 suggestion is to use a distrust framework to address the multi-facets of trust issues. The distrust framework will cover an interpersonal (e.g. benevolence, competence, integrity and predictability) and impersonal (e.g. user connectivity in trust networks) issues."}, {"heading": "Methodology", "text": "In this section, we present a brief summary of our research works.

The relation for \u211b\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc34 is reflexive with always friendly. We assumed that a nation always trust itself. Remark 2.2. The relation for \u211b\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc35 \u2260 \u211b\ud835\udc35,\ud835\udc34 is not always symmetric. In this thesis, we assumed that \u211b\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc35 = \u211b\ud835\udc35,\ud835\udc34 is symmetric, which is to simplify the modeling work.\nRemark 2.3. Relation for \u211b\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc35 and \u211b\ud835\udc35,\ud835\udc36 does not always imply that \u211b\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc36 is transitive for relations between Nation A, Nation B and Nation C.\nRemark 2.4. The relation for \u211b\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc35 and \u211b\ud835\udc35,\ud835\udc34 are commutative for binary operation (\u211b\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc35 , \u211b\ud835\udc35,\ud835\udc34) = (\u211b\ud835\udc35,\ud835\udc34, \u211b\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc35) for addition and multiplication operations.\nDEFINITION 3.

The relation for \u211b\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc35 is undefined when the relation between Nation A and Nation B is neither friendly, neutral, nor hostile. The state of the relation is unknown.\nRemark 3.2. If a definition of a nation is reduced to DEF 1 then international relations always exists because of diplomatic\nrelations and recognitions. Later we will show that the undefined relation (total uncertainty) does not exist in the real world\nexcept in a mathematical form.\nDEFINITION 4.

One may choose to use a priori probability to evaluate (assign value) for every \ud835\udce6\ud835\udc31. Given that a cardinality is equal to three, then each \ud835\udce6\ud835\udc99 is equal to \ud835\udfcf\n\ud835\udfd1 . One may also use a different value of \ud835\udce6\ud835\udc99 that is based on the number of\nproperties \ud835\udcdf as mentioned in Theorem 3. For large numbers of the properties \ud835\udcdf for a given \ud835\udce6\ud835\udc99 , the \ud835\udce6\ud835\udc99 should be increased to represent large samples of the properties \ud835\udcdf. However, the value of \ud835\udce6\ud835\udc99 is subjective to an observer. For example, if the observer wants to see differences between hostile and friendly relations for \ud835\udce1\ud835\udc68,\ud835\udc69, then a neutral \ud835\udce6\ud835\udc8f\u21a6\ud835\udfd0 should be decreased; while a friendly \ud835\udce6\ud835\udc87\u21a6\ud835\udfcf and hostile \ud835\udce6\ud835\udc89\u21a6\ud835\udfd1 should be increased.\nDEFINITION 5.

Relation \u211b\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc35 is a product of Mass Perception \ud835\udce3\ud835\udc74\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc94. The Mass Perception is a point that resides in a relative distance between a lower bound and upper bound of Mass Scalar. To determine international relations for \u211b\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc35, which either friendly, neutral or hostile:\n If the point falls into less than middle bound, it is a hostile relation;\n If the point falls into greater than middle bound, it is a friendly relation; and\n If the point falls into the middle bound, it is a neutral relation.\nRemark 7.1. Theorems 1 through 4 rely on three major conditions of international relations, which are hostile, neutral and\nfriendly. One may define more than triple conditions to implement granularity and fuzziness in the international relations.\nFor example, a septuple with additional three relations such as Near-Hostile, Near-Neutral and Near-Friendly as shown in\nFig. 1 can be used. Remark 7.2. One should not modify the triple conditions to implement additional relations because it will increase difficulties in properties \ud835\udcab classification and nominal data (value assignment). For an example, to identify and assign nominal values for Hostile\u2019s properties is much easier that compare to doing a similar work for Near-Hostile\u2019s properties. These will increase statistical efforts for data collection, data interpretation, data analysis, data computation etc. We usually apply qualitative methods for international relations (Detlef F. Sprinz, 2004; Pollack, 2001; Walt, 1998) and most data that are in raw forms (e.g. plaintexts in news, books, research publications, government official portal, documentary, online media, hacked/leaked classified information in public domains5 etc.), and some data (e.g. classified data) are not always available on the Internet because it was protected by government6. As a suggestion for more than triple scalar of relations, that is to directly map the Mass Perception\u2019s value in the Theorem 4 into the septuple scalar as shown in Fig. 1. One must define a lower bound and an upper bound for each new relation element. The new relation element is a subset of the existing triple (e.g. Near-Hostile \u2282 Hostile).\nTHEOREM 4.

(\u201cInterests Section of the Islamic Republic of Iran,\u201d 2015) and the USA use Switzerland embassy in Tehran (\u201cEmbassy of Switzerland -Foreign Interests Section,\u201d 2015). There were many international conflicts happened for both nations during the observation period (Kashani, 2015). The USA saw Iran as a threat to the world peace when Iranian Government began to utilize nuclear energy. Later, Iran was accused of doing a mass destruction weapon development instead of a civil nuclear development (Katzman, 2009). The international relations for both nations were severely strained by the nuclear issue and it elevates to international sanction by the USA (Sherman, 2013; US Department of the Treasury, 2014; Wikipedia, 2015a). After the September 11 attacks on the USA and invasion of Iraq by the USA in 2003, Iran was accused of supporting and exporting terrorism in the world, which included terrorism in Afghanistan and other nations (Mir H.

Observe that, there is toggled property in neutral \ud835\udcab2= 0.35/2, which cause the value is divided by 2. We assumed it as toggled event because the international trade sanction imposed by the USA, but simultaneously the USA is still establishing trade with Iran, which reported by the U.S. Census Bureau (Commerce, 2014). Case 3: The USA and IND (1999-2014)\nThe United States of America and India relations or Indo-American relations had been improving during the observation period. The USA President Bill Clinton imposed economic sanctions on India because Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had authorized nuclear weapon testing at Pokhran (Business Standard, 1998; Dan Balz and William Drozdiak, 1998). \u201c\"They clearly create a dangerous new instability in their region and, as a result, in accordance with U.S. law, I have decided to impose economic sanctions against India,\" Clinton said. Sanctions are mandatory under U.S. law when an undeclared nuclear state explodes a nuclear device. \u2026\u201cIn hopes of averting an arms race in southern Asia, specifically in next-door Pakistan, Clinton urged India's neighbors \"not to follow the dangerous path India has taken.\"\u201d(CNN, 1998).\nThe relations of both nations improved after the India-United States Civil Nuclear Agreement (or 123 Agreement) signed on 10 October 2008, which allow India to use civil nuclear energy and it also enable civil nuclear trade for both nations (Council on Foreign Relations, 2007; Esther Pan, 2010). India supported President Bush and Obama in a war against terrorism and both nations had waged a war against the Taliban Government in Afghanistan (BBC News, 2001; Wikipedia, 2015b).\n\u211b\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc37 showed the \ud835\udcaf\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 and \ud835\udcaf\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc61\u210e difference by 0.26.

Both case studies discussed the international nation relations between USA-GBR (friendly relation), USA-IRN (hostile relation) and USA-IND (neutral\nrelations). The weightage for trust perceptions in the relations are proportions to 2:1:2. The total properties that were considered in the observation are fifteen. Properties identification and properties value assignment are the most difficult part of the relation evaluation process. Clustering or grouping the related events for certain properties will reduce complexities for determining the properties\u2019 value. There must be a justification for each selected properties and its values. The justification efforts required an assistance of political and social science experts in the domain. A consul (or officer) in a foreign ministry may not give an honest answer if asked directly for their opinion regarding properties\u2019 value and weightages, due to possibly classified information policy concerning its foreign relations. But, if the relation algebra method is used by the foreign ministry or defense ministry, the relation algebra computation will be more accurate because the method can use classified information, which known by the ministry. We can conclude that, the properties and weightages are subjective to the observers. In this work, the properties and weightages chosen by the authors are based on public information available in the literatures (refer to the Literature Review section) and the Internet7.\nThe Dempster-Shafer\u2019s theory allows multiple events and its observation results (or opinions based on evidences) to be combined to derive a degree of belief or belief function (Shafer, 1976). To test a Dempster\u2019s rule, one may use evidence operators based on subjective logic (J\u00f8sang, 2013). It allows multiple agents (observers) to observe for one event at the same time or at difference periods, then all observation results can be combined to draw a tentative conclusion. Additional events and its evidences, and new observers may change the present result (the tentative conclusion). These three independent variables become input to decide wherein an event is fall to a given property or not. At this point, we also do not include a base value for a biased observer (Burghardt et al., 2012). The bias observer has a difference threshold in making a judgment, which leads by individualism (e.g. experience, knowledge and personal interest), internal influences (e.g. Ph.D. supervisor) and external influences (e.g. sponsor and government policy).\nThe USA-IND relations consist of a toggle event that is a property \ud835\udcab2 (economic cooperation). The economy cooperation is stopped because of economy sanctions at a certain time frame and later it is revoked. The toggle event may enable and disable (or toggled multiple times) during the observation period. For an example, a diplomatic mission (or embassy) may open when a negotiation is still acceptable, but later it is closed due to relation crisis \u2013 how to evaluate this toggled event? Should an observer decide on enable or disable this property? or enable the property by divide it into a half of the property\u2019s value? \u2013 We have chosen to divide it by a half of the property\u2019s value. It is a trivial solution.\nThe news related to the international relations circled in a terrorism and global war on terrorism, conflicts in a middle east, nuclear and mass destruction weapon, head of state relation and sentiment, economy collaboration and sanctions, close border hostility and trespassing, diplomatic and espionage, and humanity and disaster relieve aid. We used these data as International Relation case study. Without the relation algebra, we can only use unsystematically way to identify relations between nations. For an example, refer to international relations between the USA and IND in the Case 3 section, one may directly interpret that both nations were in a hostile relation because of the President of the USA had said \u201c\u2026 decided to impose economy sanctions against India\u2026 Sanctions are mandatory under U.S. law when an undeclared nuclear state explodes a nuclear device.\u201d. Through the relation algebra, we found that R\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 for \u211b\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc37 (0.135), which represent a fragile neutral relation. The relation algebra provides wider international relations assessments because it integrates multiple properties in its relation computation. The given tentative conclusions may change due to new evidence and new events that will be known by the observer in future. Furthermore, different observers may have different views regarding properties and events. One may use the Dempster-Shafer theory to evaluate (or combine) each observer\u2019s results. Later, one may further analyze the observer\u2019s results using Josang\u2019s subjective logic for an arithmetic and logic operations."}, {"heading": "Contribution and Future Work", "text": "We have presented the relation algebra method for international nation relations. The proposed method has enabled relation computation, which is previously subjective and unquantifiable. The method seamlessly works together with the existing trust methodologies, which are Dempster-Shafer theory, Josang\u2019s subjective logic and Bayesian theory. We have also presented interesting case studies to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method. We believe that our method can assist researchers studying in the field of international relations. Government officers working in foreign ministry or defense ministry may adopt our method as a quantitative methodology for international trust evaluations\n7 We do not obtain or use any material that may lead to actions of a cyber-crime, terrorism, spying or any other illegal activities.\nbetween foreign nations. Department of Defense may use our method to identify a nation that can be identified as trusted or neutral; or a hostile nation that can be anticipated as a terrorist nation or unsettled nation.\nThe most significant contribution of the proposed method that it will help to find the most trusted authorizing nation in Common Criteria. Trust is an important element to ensure Common Criteria\u2019s participant nations are able to recognize and consume Common Criteria\u2019s products. Choosing the most trusted authorizing nation for product evaluations will secure a value chain of the entire architecture of Comment Criteria. The relation algebra allows relation computations between nations that contribute to trust credentials in the Common Criteria\u2019s participant nations. The method allows one to test the Kallberg\u2019s hypothesis (Kallberg, 2012) regarding the \u201clong-term survival of CC requires abandoning the global approach and instead use established groupings of trust\u201d. To test the hypothesis, we need the relation computation method for international nation relations \u2013 that is using our method. Later, we need to evaluate trust relations between the Common Criteria\u2019s participant nations. Then, it will reveal that either the given hypothesis is valid or not.\nRefer to the Literature Review section, we have done an exhaustive search for a method to perform the relation computation in the international nation relations to no avail. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in computer science in the area of information security research to model the relation algebra method for international nation relations. We also acknowledge that, the proposed method is not completed yet, and there are many research gaps and opportunities that are still available for the future research works."}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "In this work, we have modeled the relation algebra for international nation relations.

It examined trust for international relations and its calculus, which related to Bayesian inference, Dempster-Shafer theory and subjective logic. Based on an observation in the literature, we found no literature discussing the calculus method for the international relations. To bridge this research gap, we propose a relation algebra method for international relations computation. The proposed method will allow a relation computation which is previously subjective and incomputable. We also present three international relations as case studies to demonstrate the proposed method is a real-world scenario. The method will deliver the relation computation for the international relations that to support decision makers in a government such as foreign ministry, defense ministry, presidential or prime minister office. The Department of Defense (DoD) may use our method to determine a nation that can be identified as a friendly, neutral or hostile nation.", "creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2013"}}}
