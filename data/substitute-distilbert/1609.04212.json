A powerful class of approximations that focuses on the sequential absorption of successive inputs is captured by the Neurath\u2019s ship metaphor in philosophy of science, where theory change is cast as a stochastic and gradual process shaped as much by people\u2019s limited willingness to abandon their current theory when considering alternatives as by the ground truth they hope to approach. Inspired by this metaphor and by algorithms for approximating Bayesian inference in machine learning, we propose an algorithmic-level model of causal structure learning under which learners represent only a single global hypothesis that they update locally as they gather evidence. We propose a related scheme for understanding how, under these limitations, learners choose informative interventions that manipulate the causal system to help elucidate its workings. We find support for our approach in the analysis of three experiments. KEYWORDS: active learning; causal learning; theory change; resource rationality; intervention\nBy adulthood, a normal person will have developed a sophisticated and structured understanding of the world. The \u201cblooming buzzing confusion\u201d(James, 1890, p462) of moment-tomoment sensory experience will have given way to a more coherent dance of objects and forces, relata and causal relationships. Such representations enable humans to exploit their physical and social environments in flexible and inherently model-based ways (Dolan & Dayan, 2013; Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2007; Sloman, 2005). An important question, therefore is how people learn appropriate causal relationships from the data they gather by observing and manipulating the world. Much recent work on causal learning has used Pearl\u2019s (2000) causal Bayesian network framework to demonstrate that people make broadly normative causal inferences based on cues like observed contingencies or the outcomes of interventions, which are manipulations or tests of the system (e.g. Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2009; Holyoak & Cheng, 2011; Lagnado & Sloman, 2004, 2006; Lagnado, Waldmann, Hagmayer, & Sloman, 2007). Related work has begun to explore how people engage in \u201cactive learning\u201d \u2013 selecting interventions on variables in systems of interest in order to be effective at reducing uncertainty about the true causal model (Bramley, Lagnado, & Speekenbrink, 2015; Coenen, Rehder, & Gureckis, 2015; Sobel & Kushnir, 2006; Steyvers, Tenenbaum, Wagenmakers, & Blum, 2003).\nModels of human causal learning based on Bayesian networks have tended to focus on what Marr (1982) called the computational level. This means that they consider the abstract computational problem being solved and its ideal solution rather than the actual cognitive processes involved in reaching that solution \u2013 Marr\u2019s algorithmic level. In practice the demands of computing and storing the quantities required for exactly solving the problem of causal learning are intractable for any non-trivial world and plausibly-bounded learner. Even a small number of potential relata permit massive numbers of patterns of causal relationships. Moreover, real learning contexts involve noisy (unreliable) relationships and the threat of exogenous interference, further compounding the complexity of normative inference. Navigating this space of possibilities optimally would require maintaining probability distributions across many models and updating all these probabilities whenever integrating new evidence. This evidence might in turn be gathered piecemeal over a lifetime of experience. Doing so efficiently would require choosing maximally informative interventions, a task which poses even greater computational challenges: consideration and weighting of all possible outcomes, under all possible models for all possible interventions (Murphy, 2001; Nyberg & Korb, 2006).\nIn order to understand better the cognitive processes involved in learning causal relationships, we present a detailed exploration of how people, with their limited processing resources, represent and reason about causal structure. We begin by surveying existing proposals in the literature. We then draw on the literature on algorithms for approximating probabilistic inference in computer science using these to construct a new model. We show that our new model captures the behavioral patterns using a scalable and cognitively plausible algorithm and explains why aggregate behavior appears noisily normative in the face of individual heterogeneity.\nMany existing experiments on human causal learning involve small numbers of possible structures, semi-deterministic relationships and limited choices or opportunities to intervene.\nThese constraints limit the computational demands on learners, and thus the need for heuristics or approximations. Further, in most existing studies, subjects make causal judgments only at the end of a period of learning, limiting what we can learn about how their beliefs evolved as they observed more evidence, and how this relates to intervention choice dynamics. One exception is Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015), which explored online causal learning in scenarios where participants\u2019 judgments about an underlying causal structure were repeatedly elicited over a sequence of interventional tests. Another is Bramley, Dayan, and Lagnado (2015), which built on this paradigm. Both papers explained participants\u2019 judgments with accounts that are not completely satisfying algorithmically, lacking cognitively plausible or scalable procedures that could capture the ways in which judgments and intervention choices deviated from the rational norms. Here, we develop the algorithmic level account and demonstrate that it outperforms or equals competitors in modelling the data from both previous papers and a new experiment.\nThe resulting class of algorithms embodies an old idea about theory change known as the Duhem\u2013Quine thesis (Duhem, 1991). The idea can illustrated by a simile, originally attributed to Otto Van Neurath (1932) but popularized by Quine, who writes:\n\u201cWe [theorists] are like sailors who on the open sea must reconstruct their ship but are never able to start afresh from the bottom. Where a beam is taken away a new one must at once be put there, and for this the rest of the ship is used as support. In this way, by using the old beams and driftwood the ship can be shaped entirely anew, but only by gradual reconstruction.\u201d (1969, p3)\nThe Neurath\u2019s ship metaphor describes the piecemeal growth and evolution of scientific theories over the course of history. In the metaphor, the theorist (sailor) is cast as relying on their existing theory (ship) to stay afloat, without the privilege of a dry-dock in which to make major improvements. Unable to step back and consider all possible alternatives, the theorist is limited to building on the existing theory, making a series of small changes with the goal of improving the fit.\nWe argue that people are in a similar position when it comes to their beliefs about the causal structure of the world. We propose that a learner normally maintains only a single hypothesis about the global causal model, rather than a distribution over all possibilities. They update their hypothesis by making local changes (e.g. adding, removing and reversing individual connections, nodes or subgraphs) while depending on the rest of the model as a basis. We show that by doing this, the learner can end up with a relatively accurate causal model without ever representing the whole hypothesis space or storing all the old evidence, but that their causal beliefs will exhibit a particular pattern of sequential dependence. We provide a related account of bounded intervention selection, based on the idea that learners adapt to their own learning limitations when choosing what evidence to gather next, attempting to resolve local rather than global uncertainty. Together, our Neurath\u2019s ship model and local-uncertainty-based schema for intervention selection provide a step towards an explanation of how people might achieve a resource rational (Griffiths, Lieder, & Goodman, 2015; Simon, 1982) trade-off between accuracy\nand the cognitive costs of maintaining an accurate causal model of the world.\nThe paper is organized as follows. We first formalize causal model inference at the computational level. We then highlight the ways in which past experiments have shown human learning to diverge from the predictions of this idealized account, using these to motivate two causal judgment heuristics proposed in the literature: simple endorsement (Bramley, Lagnado, & Speekenbrink, 2015; Fernbach & Sloman, 2009) and win-stay, lose-sample (Bonawitz, Denison, Gopnik, & Griffiths, 2014) before developing out own Neurath\u2019s ship framework for belief change and active learning.\nWe next show that participants\u2019 overall patterns of judgments and intervention choices are in line with the predictions of our framework across a variety of problems varying in terms of the complexity and noise in the true generative model, and whether the participants\u2019 are trained or must infer the noise.\nWe then compare models at the individual level, showing that all three causal-judgment proposals substantially outperform baseline and computational level competitors. While our Neurath\u2019s ship provides the best overall fit, we find considerable diversity of strategies across participants. In particular, we find that the simple endorsement heuristic emerges as a strong competitor. We provide additional details about the formal framework and model specification in the Appendix.

This can be broken down into three interrelated elements: (1) representing causal models (2) performing inference over possible models given evidence (observations and the outcomes of interventions), and (3) selecting interventions to gather more evidence and support this inference. We introduce the three elements here, providing more detail where indicated in Appendix A."}, {"heading": "Representation", "text": "We use a standard representation for causal models \u2013 the parameterized directed acyclic graph (Pearl, 2000, see Figure 1a). Nodes represent variables (i.e. the component parts of a causal system); arrows represent causal connections; and parameters encode the combined influence of parents (the source of an arrow) on children (the arrow\u2019s target)1. Such graphs can represent continuous variables and any form of causal relationship; but here we focus on systems of binary {0 = absent, 1 = present} variables and and assume generative connections \u2013 meaning we assume that the presence of a cause will always raise the probability that the effect is also present.2\n1Following standard graph nomenclature, we will often refer to the space between a pair of nodes in a model as an \u201cedge\u201d, so that an acyclic causal model defines each edge as taking one of three states: forward \u2192, backward \u2190, or inactive \u2205.\n2It is worth noting that these graphs cannot naturally represent cyclic or reciprocal relationships. However, there are various ways to extend the formalism as we discuss in General Discussion, and our theory is not fundamentally\nWe also adopt Cheng\u2019s Power PC (1997) convention for parameterization, which provides a simple way to capture how probabilistic causal influences combine. This assumes that causes have independent chances of producing their effects, meaning the probability that a variable takes the value 1 is a noisy-OR combination of the power or strength wS of any active causes of it in the model (we assume that this value is the same for all connections), together with that of an omnipresent background strength wB encapsulating the influence of any causes exogenous to the model. We write w = {wS , wB}. The probability that variable x takes the value 1 is thus\nP (x = 1|pa(x),w) = 1\u2212 (1\u2212 wB)(1\u2212 wS) \u2211 y\u2208pa(x) y (1)\nwhere pa(x) denotes the parents of variable x in the causal model (see Figure 1a for an example). For convenience, we assume w is the same for all components.3"}, {"heading": "Inference", "text": "Each causal modelm over variablesX with strength and background parameters w, assigns a probability to each datum d = {x . . . z}, propagating information from the variables that are fixed through intervention c, to the others (see Figure 1b). The space of all possible interventions C is made up of all possible combinations of fixed and unfixed variables, and for each intervention c the possible data Dc is made up of all combinations of absent/present on the unfixed variables. We use Pearl\u2019s Do[.] operator (Pearl, 2000) to denote what is fixed on a given test. For instance, Do[x= 1, y = 0] means a variable x has been fixed \u201con\u201d and variable y has been fixed \u201coff\u201d, with all other variables free to vary4. Interventions allow a learner to override the normal flow of causal influence in a system, initiating activity at some components and blocking potential influences between others. This means they can provide information about the presence and direction of influences between variables that is typically unavailable from purely observational data (see Bramley, Lagnado, & Speekenbrink, 2015; Pearl, 2000, for a more detailed introduction), without additional cues such as temporal information (Bramley, Gerstenberg, & Lagnado, 2014). For instance, in Figure 1b, we fix y to 1 and leave x and z free (c = Do[y = 1]). Under the x \u2192 y \u2192 z model we would then expect x to activate with probability wB and z with a probability of 1\u2212 (1\u2212 wB)(1\u2212 wS).\nIn total, the probability of datum d, given intervention c, is just the product of the probability of each variable that was not intervened upon, given the states of its parents in the model\nP (d|m,w, c) = \u220f\nx\u2208(X/\u2208c) P (x|{d, c}pa(x),w).

Our\ntied to a particular representation. 3We also restrict ourselves to cases without any latent variable, although we note that imputing the presence of hidden variables is another important and computationally-challenging component of causal inference (Buchanan, Tenenbaum, & Sobel, 2010; Kushnir, Gopnik, Lucas, & Schulz, 2010).\n4We include the pure observation Do[\u2205] in C.\nprior belief P (M) is then an assignment of probabilities, adding up to 1 across possible models m \u2208 M in the set of models M. When we observe some data D = {di}, associated with interventions C = {ci}, we can update these beliefs with Bayes theorem by multiplying our prior by the probability of the observed data under each model and dividing by the weighted average probability of those data across all the possible models:\nP (m|D,w;C) = P (D|m,w;C)P (m)\u2211 m\u2032\u2208M P (D|m\u2032,w;C)P (m\u2032) . (3)\nWe will typically treat the data as being independent and identically distributed, soP (D|m,w;C) =\u220f i P (d\ni|m,w; ci). If the data arrive sequentially (as Dt = {d1, . . . ,dt}; and similarly for the interventions), we can either store them and update at the end, or update our beliefs sequentially, taking the posterior P (M |Dt\u22121,w;Ct\u22121) at timestep t \u2212 1 as the new \u201cprior\u201d for datum dt. If we are also unsure about the parameters of the true model (i.e. wB and wS) we have to treat them as random variables too and average over our uncertainty about them to compute a marginal posterior over models M (see Appendix A)."}, {"heading": "Choosing interventions", "text": "It is clear that different interventions yield different outcomes, which in turn have different probabilities under different models. This means that which interventions are valuable for identifying the true model depends strongly on the hypothesis space and prior. For instance fixing y to 1 (Do[y= 1]) is (probabilistically) diagnostic if you are primarily unsure whether x causes z because p(z|Do[y=1]) differs depending whether pa(z) includes x. However, it is not diagnostic if you are primarily unsure whether x causes y because y will take the value 1 the same regardless of whether pa(x) includes y.\nThe value of an intervention can be quantified relative to a notion of uncertainty. We can define the value of an intervention as the expected reduction in uncertainty about the true model after seeing its outcome.5 To calculate this expectation, we must average, prospectively,\n5Strictly this is greedy rather than optimal because planning several steps ahead can result in a different intervention\nover the different possible outcomes d\u2032 \u2208 Dc (recalling Dc is the space of possible outcomes of intervention c) weighted by their marginal likelihoods under the prior. For a greedily optimal sequence of interventions c1, . . . , ct, we take P (M |Dt\u22121,w;Ct\u22121) as our prior each time. The most valuable intervention ct at a given time point is then\narg max c\u2208C E d\u2032\u2208Dc\n[ \u2206H(M |d\u2032, Dt\u22121,w;Ct\u22121, c) ] , (4)\nwhere E[.]d\u2032\u2208Dc denotes the average over outcomes d\u2032 and \u2206H(.) denotes reduction in uncertainty. We use Shannon entropy (1951) to measure uncertainty (see Appendix A). Shannon is just one of a broad family of possible entropy measures (Nielsen & Nock, 2011). However, it is one that has proved at least as long-run successful as a number of variants when applied as a greedy strategy for choosing interventions (Bramley, Nelson, Speekenbrink, Crupi, & Lagnado, 2014) or asking binary questions (Nelson, 2005).\nBehavioral patterns and existing explanations Unfortunately, both inference and choosing interventions scale so poorly in the number of variables, they are fundamentally intractable for any plausibly bounded learner (Cooper, 1990; van Rooij, Wright, Kwisthout, & Wareham, 2014). The number of possible graphs grows rapidly with the number of variables they relate (3-, 4- and 5-variable problems have 25, 543 and 29281 respectively). Active intervention selection adds extra complexity because there are many possible interventions (3-,4- and 5- variable problems permit 27, 81 and 243 patterns of fixed \u201con\u201d, fixed \u201coff\u201d and free components), each of which might yield many outcomes (up to 8, 16 and 32 respectively, depending how many variables are left free to vary). All combinations of potential model, intervention and outcome should be averaged over in order to select the most valuable intervention. This implies that people must find a considerably more economical way to approximate model inference while maintaining satisfactory accuracy.\nIt is therefore not surprising that behavioral learning patterns in existing studies exhibit marked divergence from the predictions of idealized Bayesian learning. Participants\u2019 model judgments are typically robustly better than chance, yet poor when compared directly against an idealized Bayesian learner (Bramley, Gerstenberg, & Lagnado, 2014; Fernbach & Sloman, 2009; Lagnado & Sloman, 2002, 2004). Likewise, adults and even children have been shown to select interventions that are robustly more informative than chance, but much less efficient than idealized active learning (Bramley, Lagnado, & Speekenbrink, 2015; Coenen et al., 2015; Gureckis & Markant, 2009; Lucas, Bridgers, Griffiths, & Gopnik, 2014; Markant & Gureckis, 2012; McCormack, Bramley, Frosch, Patrick, & Lagnado, 2016; Steyvers et al., 2003).\nMore revealing than mere performance are the ways in which participants\u2019 judgments diverge from these rational norms (Anderson, 1990). Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015) found that participants\u2019 judgments in a sequential active causal learning task resembled probability matching when lumped together, but that individuals\u2019 trajectories were not well captured by simply adding decision noise to the Bayesian predictions. Individuals\u2019 sequences\nbeing favored. However, planning ahead was shown to make little difference for the similar problems explored in Bramley et al (2015).\nof judgments were much too sequentially dependent, or \u201csticky\u201d, compared to the Bayesian predictions, tending to remain the same or similar over multiple elicitations as the objectively most likely structure shifted. At the same time, when participants did change their judgments, they tended to do so in ways that were consistent with the most recently gathered evidence, neglecting evidence gathered earlier in learning. The result was a dual pattern of recency in terms of judgments\u2019 consistency with the evidence, and stickiness in terms of consistency with the previous judgments. Bramley et al found that they could capture these patterns with the addition of two parameters to the Bayesian model. The first was a forgetting parameter, encoding trial-by-trial leakage of information from the posterior as it became the prior for the next test. The second was a conservatism parameter, encoding a non-normatively high probability assigned to the latest causal hypothesis. While the resulting model captured participants choices, it still made the implausible assumption that learners maintained weighted probabilistic beliefs across the whole hypothesis space and performed efficient active learning with respect to these.\nAs with Bramley et al, Bonawitz et al. (2014) found that children and adults\u2019 online structure judgments exhibited sequential dependence. To account for this they proposed an account of how causal learners might rationally reduce the computational effort of continually reconsidering their model. In their \u201cwin-stay, lose-sample\u201d scheme they suggest that learners maintain a single structural hypothesis, only resampling a new hypothesis from the posterior when they see something surprising under their current model, concretely, with a probability that increases as the most recent observation becomes less probable. This scheme guarantees that the learner\u2019s latest hypothesis is a sample from the posterior distribution at every point, but does not the require them to resample with every new trial. While it captures the intuitive idea that people will tend to stick with a hypothesis until it fails to perform, \u201cwin-stay, lose-sample\u201d still requires the learner to store all the past evidence to use when resampling, and does not provide a recipe for how the samples are drawn.6\nAnother approach to understanding deviations between people\u2019s causal judgments and rational norms comes from the idea that people construct causal models in a modular or piecewise way. For example, Waldmann, Cheng, Hagmayer, and Blaisdell (2008) propose a minimal rational model under which learners infer the relationships between each pair of variables separately without worrying about the dependencies between them, ending up with a modular causal model that allows for good local inferences but which leads to so-called \u201cMarkov violations\u201d in more complex inferences where participants fail to respect the conditional dependencies and independences implied by the global model (Rehder, 2014). They show that this minimal model is sufficient to capture participants judgment patterns in two case studies. Building on this idea of locality, Fernbach and Sloman (2009) asked participants to make judgments following observation of several preselected interventions. They found that participants were particularly bad at inferring chains, often inferring spurious additional links from the root to the sink node (e.g. x \u2192 z as well as x \u2192 y and y \u2192 z), a pattern also observed in Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015). Fernbach and Sloman proposed that this was\n6The authors mention that MCMC could be used to draw these samples without representing the full posterior.\na consequence of participants inferring causal relationships through local rather than global computations. In the example, the interventions on x would normally lead to activations of z due to the indirect connection via y. If learners attended only to x and z there would be the appearance of a direct relationship. They found that they could better model participants by assuming they inferred each causal link separately while ignoring the the rest of the model. Embodying this principle, (Bramley, Lagnado, & Speekenbrink, 2015) proposed a simple endorsement heuristic for online causal learning that would tend to add direct edges to a model between intervened-on variables and any variables that activated as a result, removing edges going to any variables that didn\u2019t activate. By doing this after each new piece of evidence, the model exhibited recency as the older edges would tend to be overwritten by newly inferred ones, as well as as capturing the pattern of adding unnecessary direct connections in causal chains. The model did a good job of predicting participants\u2019 patterns but was outperformed by the Bayesian model bounded with forgetting and conservatism. Additionally, like any heuristic, simple endorsement\u2019s success is conditional on its match to the situation. For instance, simple endorsement does badly in cases where there are many chains \u2013 meaning that the outcome of many interventions are indirect, and also if the true wB is high.\nGoing beyond causal learning, sequential effects are ubiquitous in cognition. In some instances they can be rational; for instance moderate recency is rational in a changing world (Julier & Uhlmann, 1997). Regardless, there are a plethora of non Bayesian models that can reproduce various sequential effects (DeCarlo, 1992; Gilden, 2001; Treisman & Williams, 1984). A common class of these is based on the idea of adjusting an estimate part way toward new evidence (e.g. Einhorn & Hogarth, 1986; Petrov & Anderson, 2005; Rescorla & Wagner, 1972). Updating point estimates means that a learner need not keep all the evidence in memory but can instead make use of the location of the point(s) as a proxy for what was learned in the past. Bramley, Dayan, and Lagnado (2015) propose a model inspired by these ideas, that maintains a single hypothesis, but simultaneously attempts to minimize edits along with the number of variables\u2019 latest states that the current model fails to explain. The result is a model where the current belief acts as an anchor and the learner tends to try to explain the latest evidence by making the minimal number of changes to it. Again, this model provided a good fit with participants\u2019 judgments, but did not provide a procedure for how participants were able to search the hypothesis space for the causal structure that minimized these constraints.\nIn summary, a number of ideas and models have been proposed in the causal and active learning literatures. By design, they all do a good job of capturing patterns in human causal judgments. However, it is not clear that any of these proposals provide a general purpose, scalable explanation for human success in learning a complex causal world-model. Some (e.g win-stay, lose-sample) capture behavioral patterns within the normative framework, but do not provide a scalable algorithm. Others (e.g. simple endorsement) provide simple scalable heuristics but may not generalize beyond the tasks they were designed for, nor explain human successes in harder problems. In the next section we take inspiration from methods for approximate inference in machine learning to construct a general purpose algorithm for incremental structure change that satisfies both these desiderata.\nAlgorithms for causal learning with limited resources We now turn to algorithms in machine learning that make approximate learning efficient in otherwise intractable circumstances. Additionally, research in these fields on active learning and optimal experiment design has identified a range of reasonable heuristics for selecting queries when the full expected information calculation of (Equation 4) is intractable. We will take inspiration from some of these ideas to give a formal basis to the intuitions behind the Neurath\u2019s ship metaphor. We will then use this formal model to generate predictions that we will compare to participants\u2019 behavior in several experiments."}, {"heading": "Approximating with a few hypotheses", "text": "One common approximation, for situations where a posterior cannot be evaluated in closed form, is to maintain a manageable number of individual hypotheses, or \u201cparticles\u201d (Liu & Chen, 1998), with weights corresponding to their relative likelihoods. The ensemble of particles then acts as an approximation to the desired distribution. Sophisticated reweighting and resampling schemes can then filter the ensemble as data are observed, approximating Bayesian inference.\nThese \u201cparticle filtering\u201d methods have been used to explain how humans and other animals might approximate the solutions to complex problems of probabilistic inference. In associative learning (Courville & Daw, 2007), categorization (Sanborn, Griffiths, & Navarro, 2010) and binary decision making (Vul, Goodman, Griffiths, & Tenenbaum, 2009), it has been proposed that people\u2019s beliefs actually behave most like a single particle, capturing why individuals often exhibit fluctuating and sub-optimal judgment while maintaining a connection to Bayesian inference, particularly at the population level."}, {"heading": "Sequential local search", "text": "The idea that people\u2019s causal theories are like particles requires they also have some procedure for sampling or adapting these theories as evidence is observed. Another class of useful machine learning methods involves generating sequences of hypotheses, each linked to the next via a form of possibly stochastic transition mechanism. Two members of this class are particularly popular in the present context: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, which asymptotically approximates the posterior distribution; and (stochastic) hill climbing, which merely tries to find hypotheses that have high posterior probabilities.\nMCMC algorithms involve stochastic transitions with samples that are typically easy to generate. Under various conditions, this implies that the sequences of (dependent) sample hypotheses form a Markov chain with a stationary distribution that is the full, intended, posterior distribution (Metropolis, Rosenbluth, Rosenbluth, Teller, & Teller, 1953). The samples will appear to \u201cwalk\u201d randomly around space of possibilities, tending to visit more probable hypotheses more frequently. If samples are extracted from the sequence after a sufficiently long initial, so-called burn-in, period, and sufficiently far apart (to reduce the effect of dependence), they can provide a good approximation to the true posterior distribution. There are typically many different classes of Markov chain transitions that share the same stationary distribution,\nbut differ in the properties of burn-in and subsampling.\nThe stochasticity inherent in MCMC algorithms implies that the sequence sometimes makes a transition from a more probable to a less probable hypothesis \u2013 this is necessary to sample multi-modal posterior distributions. A more radical heuristic is only to allow transitions to more probable hypotheses \u2014 this is called \u201chill-climbing\u201d, attempting to find, and then stick at, the best hypothesis (Tsamardinos, Brown, & Aliferis, 2006). This is typically faster than a full MCMC algorithm to find a good hypothesis, but is prone to become stuck in a local optimum, where the current hypothesis is more likely than all its neighbors, but less likely than some other more distant hypothesis.\nApplied to causal structure inference, we might in either case consider transitions that change at most a single edge in the model (Cooper & Herskovits, 1992; Goudie & Mukherjee, 2011). A simple case is Gibbs sampling (Geman & Geman, 1984), starting with some structural hypothesis and repeatedly selecting an edge (randomly or systematically) and re-sampling it (either adding, removing or reversing) conditional on state of the other edges. This means that a learner can search for a new hypothesis by making local changes to their current hypothesis, reconsidering each of the edges in turn, conditioning on the state of the others without ever enumerating all the possibilities. By constructing a short chain of such \u201crethinks\u201d a learner can easily update a singular hypothesis without starting from scratch. The longer the chain, the less dependent or \u201clocal\u201d the new hypothesis will be to the starting point.\nThe idea that stochastic local search plays an important role in cognition has some precedent (Gershman, Vul, & Tenenbaum, 2012; Sanborn et al., 2010). For instance, Abbott, Austerweil, and Griffiths (2012) propose a random local search model of memory retrieval and Ullman, Goodman, and Tenenbaum (2012) propose an MCMC search model for capturing how children search large combinatorial theory spaces when learning intuitive physical theories like taxonomy and magnetism. The idea that people might update their judgments by something like MCMC sampling is also explored by Lieder, Griffiths and Goodman (2012; under review). They argue that under reasonable assumptions about the costs of resampling and need for accuracy, it can be rational to update one\u2019s beliefs by constructing short chains where the the updated judgment retains some dependence on its starting state, arguing that this might explain anchoring effects (Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982).\nIn addition to computational savings, updating beliefs by local search can be desirable for statistical reasons. If the learner has forgotten some of the evidence they have seen, the location of their previous hypothesis acts like a very approximate version of a sufficient statistic for the forgotten information. This can make it advantageous to the learner to strike a good balance between editing their model to account better for the data they can remember, and staying close to their previous model to retain the connection to the data they have forgotten (Bramley, Lagnado, & Speekenbrink, 2015).\nNeurath\u2019s ship: An algorithmic-level model of sequential belief\nchange The previous section summarized two ideas derived from computer science and statistics that provide a potential solution to the computational challenges of causal learning: maintaining only a single hypothesis at a time, and exploring new hypotheses using local search based on sampling. In this section, we formalize these ideas to define a class of models of causal learning inspired by the metaphor of Neurath\u2019s ship. We start by treating interventions as given, and only focus on inference. We then consider the nature of the interventions.\nConcretely, we propose that causal learners maintaining only a single causal model (a single particle), bt\u22121 and a collection of recent evidence and interventionsDt\u22121r and Ct\u22121r at time t\u2212 1. They then make inferences by:\n1. Observing the latest evidence dt and ct and adding it to the collection to makeDtr and Ctr. 2. Then, searching for local improvements to bt\u22121 by sequentially reconsidering edgesEij \u2208 {1 : i \u2192 j, 0 : i = j, \u2212 1 : i \u2190 j} (adding, subtracting or reorienting them) conditional on the current state of the edges in the rest of their model E\\ij \u2013 e.g. with probability\nP (Eij |E\\ij ,Dtr, Ctr,w).\n3. After searching for k steps, stopping and taking the latest version of their model as their\nnew belief bt. If bt differs from bt\u22121 the evidence is forgotten (Dtr and Ctr become {}), and they begin collecting evidence again.\nA detailed specification of this process is given in Appendix A.\nStarting with any hypothesis and repeatedly resampling edges conditional on the others is a form of Gibbs sampling (Goudie & Mukherjee, 2011). Further, the learner can make use of the data they have forgotten by starting the search with their current belief bt\u22121, since these data are represented to some degree in the location of bt\u22121. Resampling using the recent data P (M |Dtr, Ctr,w) allows the learner to adjust their beliefs to encapsulate better the data they have just seen, and let this evidence fall out of memory once it has been incorporated into the model.\nResampling, hill climbing or random change Following the procedure outlined above, the learner\u2019s search steps would constitute dependent samples from the posterior over structures givenDtr. However, it is also plausible that learners will try to hill-climb rather than sample, preferring to move to more probable local models more strongly than would be predicted by Gibbs sampling. In order to explore this, we will consider generalizations of of the update equation allowing transitions to be governed by powers of the conditional edge probability (i.e. P\u03c9(Eij = e|E\\ij ,Dtr, Ctr,w)), yielding stronger or weaker preference for the most likely state of Eij depending whether \u03c9 > 1 or < 1. By setting \u03c9 to zero, we would get a model that does not learn but just moves randomly between hypotheses, tending to remain local and by setting it to infinity we would get a model that always moved to the most likely state for the edge."}, {"heading": "Search length", "text": "It is reasonable to assume that the number of search steps k that a learner performs will be variable, but that their capacity to search will be relatively stable. Therefore, we assume that for each update, the learner searches for k steps, where k is drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean \u03bb \u2208 [0,\u221e]. The value of \u03bb thus determines how sequentially dependent a learner\u2019s sequences of beliefs are. A large \u03bb codifies a tendency to move beliefs a long way to account for the latest dataDtr at the expense of the older data \u2013 retained only in the location of the previous belief bt\u22121 \u2013 while a moderate \u03bb captures a reasonable trade-off between starting state and new evidence, and a small \u03bb captures conservatism, i.e. failure to shift beliefs enough to account for the latest data.7"}, {"heading": "Putting these together", "text": "By representing the transition probabilities from model i to model j, for a particular setting of hill climbing parameter \u03c9 and data Dtr, with a transition matrix R\u03c9t , we can thus make probabilistic predictions about a learner\u2019s new belief bt \u2208 Bt.8 The probabilities depend on the previous belief bt\u22121 and their average search length \u03bb. By averaging over different search lengths with their probability controlled by \u03bb, and taking the requisite row of the resulting transition matrix we get the following equation\nP (bt = m|Dtr, Ctr, bt\u22121, \u03c9, \u03bb) = \u221e\u2211 0 \u03bbke\u2212\u03bb k! [(R\u03c9t ) k]bt\u22121m (5)\nNote that this equation describes the probability of a Neurath\u2019s ship style search terminating in a given new location. The learner themselves need only follow the four steps described above, sampling particular edges and search length rather than averaging over the possible values of these quantities. See Appendix A for more details and Figure 2 for an example.\nSelecting interventions on Neurath\u2019s ship: A local uncertainty\nschema In situations where a posterior is already hard to evaluate, calculating the globally most informative intervention \u2013 finding the intervention ct that maximizes Equation 4 \u2013 will almost always be infeasible. Therefore, a variety of heuristics have been developed that allow tests to be selected that are more useful than random selection, but do not require the full expected information gain be computed (Settles, 2012). These tend to rely on the learners\u2019 current, rather than expected, uncertainty (e.g. uncertainty sampling which chooses based on outcome uncertainty under the prior) or the predictions under just a few favored hypotheses (e.g. query by committee) as a substitute for the full expectancy calculation. The former relies on maintaining\n7Note that we later cap k at 50 when estimating our model having established that search lengths beyond these bounds made negligible difference to predictions.\n8We define this matrix formally in Appendix A. Note that we assume transitions that would create a loop in the overall model get a probability of zero. This assumption could be dropped for learning dynamic Bayesian networks but is necessary for working with directed acyclic graphs.\na complete prior distribution, making the latter a more natural partner to the Neurath\u2019s ship framework.\nWe have proposed a model of structure inference under which learners are only able to consider a small set of of alternatives at a time, and only able to generate alternatives that are \u201clocal\u201d in some dimension. Locally driven intervention selection is a natural partner to this for at least two reasons: (1) Under the constraints of the Neurath\u2019s ship framework, learners would not be able to work with the prospective distributions required to estimate global expected informativeness, but could potentially estimate expected informativeness with respect to a sufficiently narrow sets of alternatives. (2) Evidence optimized to distinguishing local\npossibilities (focused on one edge at a time for instance) might better support sequential local belief updates (of the kind emphasized in our framework) than the globally most informative evidence (Patil, Zhu, Kopec\u0301, & Love, 2014). In line with this, we propose one way in which learners might select robustly informative interventions by attempting only to distinguish a few \u201clocal\u201d possibilities at a time, requiring only \u201clocal\u201d uncertainty estimates to target the possibilities on which to focus (Markant, Settles, & Gureckis, 2015).\nThe idea that learners will focus on distinguishing only a few alternatives at a time requires specifying how they choose which of the many possible subsets of the full hypothesis space to target with a particular test. Queries that optimally reduce expected uncertainty about one local aspect of a problem are liable to differ from those that promise high global uncertainty reduction. For example, Figure 3b shows two trials taken from our experiments, and shows that the expected values of each of a range of different intervention choices (shown in Figure 3a) are very different depending whether the learner is focused on resolving global uncertainty all at once, or on resolving some specific \u201clocal\u201d aspect of it. This illustrates the idea that a learner might choose a test that is optimally informative with respect to a modest range of options that they have in mind at the time (e.g. models that differ just in terms of the state of Exz) yet appear sporadically inefficient from the perspective of greedy global uncertainty reduction. Furthermore, by licensing quite different intervention preferences, they allow us to diagnose individual and trial-by-trial differences in focus preference.\nIn the current work, we will consider three possible varieties of focus, one motivated by the Neurath\u2019s ship framework (edge focus) and two inspired by existing ideas about bounded search and discovery in the literature (effects focus and confirmation focus). While these are by no means exhaustive they represent a reasonable starting point."}, {"heading": "The two stages of the schema", "text": "The idea that learners focus on resolving local rather than global uncertainty results in a metaproblem of choosing what to focus on next, making intervention choice a two stage process. We write L for the set of all possible foci l, and L \u2282 L for the subset of possibilities that the learner will consider at a time, such as the the state of a particular edge or the effects of a particular variable. The procedure is: Stage 1 Selecting a local focus lt \u2208 L\nStage 2 Selecting an informative test ct with respect to the chosen focus lt\nDifferent learners might differ in the types of questions they consider, meaning thatLmight contain different varieties and combinations of local focuses. We first formalize the two stages of the schema, and then propose three varieties of local focus that learners might consider in their option set L that differ in terms of which and how many alternatives they include. As mentioned above, we assume that the learner has some way of estimating their current local confidence. We will assume confidence here is approximately the inverse of uncertainty, so assume for simplicity that learners can calculate uncertainty from the evidence they have gathered since last changing their model in the form of the entropy H(l|Dtr,w; Ctr) for all l \u2208 L (the assumption we examine in the discussion). They then choose (Stage 1) the locale where\nthese data imply the least certainty\nlt = arg max l\u2208L H(l|bt\u22121,Dtr,w; Ctr) (6)\nHowever, in carrying out Stage 2 we make the radical assumption that learners do not use P (lt|Dtr, bt\u22121,w; Ctr), but rather, consistent with the method of inference itself, only consider the potential next datum d\u2032. This means that the intervention ct itself is chosen to maximize the expected information about lt, ignoring pre-existing evidence, and using what amounts to a uniform prior. Specifically, we assume that ct is chosen as\nct = arg max c\u2208C E d\u2208Dc\n[ \u2206H(lt|d,w, bt\u22121; c) ] (7)\nwhere we detail the term in the expectation below for the three types of focuses.\nAssuming real learners will exhibit some decision noise, we can model both choice of focus and choice of intervention relative to a focus as soft (Luce, 1959) rather than strict maximization giving focus probabilities\nP (lt|Dtr, bt\u22121,w; Ctr) = exp(H(lt|Dtr, bt\u22121,w; Ctr)\u03c1)\u2211 l\u2208L exp(H(l|Dtr, bt\u22121,w; Ctr)\u03c1)\n(8)\ngoverned by some inverse temperature parameter \u03c1, and choice probabilities\nP (ct|l,w, bt\u22121) = exp(Ed\u2032\u2208Dc\n[ \u2206H(l|d\u2032,w, bt\u22121; ct) ] \u03b7)\u2211\nc\u2208C exp(Ed\u2032\u2208Dc [\u2206H(l|d\u2032,w, bt\u22121; c)] \u03b7) (9)\ngoverned by inverse temperature \u03b7.\nThree varieties of local focus"}, {"heading": "Edges", "text": "An obvious choice, given the Neurath\u2019s ship framework, would be for learners to try to distinguish alternatives that differ in terms of a single edge (Figure 3a), i.e. those they would consider during a single update step.\nFor a chosen edge Exy we can then consider a learner\u2019s goal to be to maximise their expec-\ntation of\n\u2206H(Exy|Et\u22121\\xy ,d,w; c) (10)\n(see Appendix A for the full local entropy equations).

In the case of identifying the true deterministic (wS = 1 and wB = 0) causal model on N variables through interventions it turns out that the best split is achieved by querying the effects of a randomly chosen variable, essentially asking: \u201cWhat does x do?\u201d (Figure 3a)9. Formally we might think of this question as asking: which other variables (if any) are descendants of variable x in the true model?

Confirmatory evidence gathering is a ubiquitous psychological phenomenon (Klayman & Ha, 1989; Nickerson, 1998). Although confirmation seeking is widely touted as a bias, it can also be shown to be optimal, for example under deterministic or sparse hypotheses spaces or peaked priors (Austerweil & Griffiths, 2011; Navarro & Perfors, 2011).\nAccordingly, Coenen et al. (2015) propose that causal learners adopt a \u201cpositive test strategy\u201d when distinguishing causal models. They define this as a preference to \u201cturn on\u201d a parent component of one\u2019s hypothesis \u2013 observing whether the activity propagates to the other variables in the way that this hypothesis predicts. They find that people often intervene on suspected parent components, even when this is uninformative, and do so more often under time pressure. In Coenen et al\u2019s tasks, the goal was always to distinguish between two hypotheses, so their model assumed people would sum over the number of descendants each variable had under each hypotheses and turn on the component that had the most descendants on average. However, this does not generalize to the current, unrestricted, context where all variables have\n9This is also the most globally informative type of test relative to a uniform prior in all of the noise conditions we consider in the current paper 10The number of directed acyclic graphs on N nodes, |M|N , can be computed with the recurrence relation |M|N =\u2211 k\u2208N (\u22121) k\u22121(N 2 ) 2k(N\u2212k)|M|N\u22121 (see Robinson, 1977)\nthe same number of descendants if you average over the whole hypothesis space. However, Steyvers et al (2003) propose a related rational test model that selects interventions with a goal of distinguishing a single current hypothesis from a null hypothesis that there is no causal connection.\nFollowing Steyvers et al. (2003), for a confirmatory focus we consider interventions expected to best reduce uncertainty between the learner\u2019s current hypothesis bt\u22121 and a null b0 in which there are no connections (Figure 3a).\n\u2206H({bt, b0}|bt\u22121,d,w; c) (12)\nThis goal results in a preference for fixing on the root node(s) of the target hypothesis (Figure 3c ii, noting the confirmation focus favours Do[x= 1, y= 1] here). The effectiveness of confirmatory focused testing depends on the level of noise and the prior, becoming increasingly useful later once the model being tested has sufficiently high prior probability. For a confirmation focused learner there is always just a single local focus."}, {"heading": "Implications of the schema", "text": "The local uncertainty schema implies that intervention choice depends on two separable stages. Thus it accommodates the idea that a learner might be poor at choosing what to focus on but good at selecting an informative intervention relative to their chosen focus. It also allows that we might understand differences in learners\u2019 intervention choices as consequences of the types of local focus they are inclined or able to focus on. Learners cognizant of the limitations in their ability to incorporate new evidence might choose to focus their intervention on narrower questions (i.e. learning about a single edge at a time) while others might focus too broadly and fail to learn effectively. In the current work we will fit behavior assuming that learners choose between these local focuses, using their patterns to diagnose which local focuses they include in their option set L, which of these they choose on a given test lt and finally how these choices relate to their final performance.\nComparing model predictions to experiments The Neurath\u2019s ship framework we have introduced has two distinct signatures. Making only local edits from a single hypothesis results in sequential dependence. Making these edits by local resampling leads to aggregate behavior that can range between probability matching and hill climbing\u2013which can give better short term gains but with a tendency to get stuck in local optima. Two of the other heuristics also lead to sequential dependence. Win-stay lose-sample predicts all-or-none dependence whereby learners\u2019 judgments will either stay the same or jump to a new location that depends only on the posterior. Simple endorsement also predicts recency, although is distinguished by its failure to separate direct from indirect effects of interventions, leading to a different pattern of structural change.\nIn terms of interventions, if participants are locally focused, we expect their hypotheses to deviate from optimal predictions in ways that can be accommodated by our local uncertainty schema, i.e. selecting interventions that are more likely to be targeted toward local rather than\nglobal uncertainty. If learners do not maintain the full posterior, we expect their intervention distributions to be relatively insensitive to the evidence that has already been seen, while still being locally informative. If people disproportionately focus on identifying effects, we expect to see relatively unconstrained interventions with one variable fixed \u201con\u201d at a time. If people focus on individual edges we expect more constraining interventions with more variables\nfixed \u201coff\u201d. If confirmatory tests are employed, we expect to see more interventions on putative parents than on child nodes.\nWe first compare the predictions of our framework to existing data from Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015).

The tests people chose, along with the parameters w of the true underlying causal model, jointly determined the data they saw. In this experiment wS was always .8 and wB was always .1.

This led to the choice of a mixture of \u201cone-on\u201d and \u201ctwo-on\u201d interventions.\nLike the ideal or the effects focused simulations, participants in Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015) strongly favored \u201cone-on\u201d tests. Consistent with confirmatory testing, components with at least one child according to the latest hypothesis bt\u22121 were more likely to be fixed \u201con\u201d than components believed to have no children (60% compared to 56% of the time t(24568) = 3.2, p = .001).13 Participants\u2019 intervention selections were markedly less dynamic across trials than those of the efficient learner. For example, the proportion of single (e.g. [x=1]) interventions decreased only fractionally on later tests, dropping from 78% to 73% from the first to the last test."}, {"heading": "Motivating the new experiments", "text": "In analyzing Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015), we found patterns of judgments and interventions broadly consistent with our framework. However, the conclusions we can draw from this data alone are somewhat limited. Firstly, the problems participants faced did not strongly delineate our Neurath\u2019s ship proposal from other proposed approximations, namely the approximate win-stay, lose-sample or the heuristic simple endorsement which also predicted similar patterns of accuracy and sequential dependence.\nSimilarly, in terms of interventions, participants\u2019 strong preference for \u201cone-on\u201d interventions was consistent with local effect-focused testing. However, \u201cone-on\u201d interventions were also the globally most informative choices for the majority of participants\u2019 trials, especially early during learning. Thus, we cannot be confident what participants focused on when selecting their interventions.\nMethodologically also, several aspects of Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015) are suboptimal for testing our framework. Participants were allowed to leave edges unspecified until the the last test and could also draw cyclic models, both of which complicated our analyses. Furthermore, participants had 12 tests on each problem, allowing an idealized learner to approach certainty given the high wS and low wB , and for a significant minority of people to perform at ceiling. These choices limit the incentive for participants to be efficient with their interventions. Additionally, participants were only incentivised to be accurate with their final judgment, meaning we cannot be confident that intermediate judgments always represented their best and latest guess about the model. Finally, participants were not forced to update all their edges after each test, meaning that lazy responding could be confused with genuine sequential dependence of beliefs.\nNext, we report on two new experiments that build on the paradigm from Bramley, Lagnado,\nand Speekenbrink (2015), making methodological improvements, while also exploring harder more revealing problems, and eliciting additional measures, all with the goal of better distin-\n13We ran the same number of simulated learners as participants in each experiment and condition to facilitate statistical comparison.\nguishing our framework from competitors.\nExperiment 1 explores learning in more complex problems than in Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015), with more variables and a range of strengthswS and levels of background noise wB , and fewer interventions per problem. The increased complexity and noise provides\nmore space and stronger motivation for the use of approximations and heuristics. Furthermore, the broader range of possible structures and intervention choices increases the discriminability of our framework from alternatives such as win-stay, lose-sample and simple endorsement, while the shorter problems avoid ceiling effects and ensure participants choose interventions carefully. To ensure participants register their best and latest belief at every time point, we also incentivize participants through their accuracy at random time points during learning. To eliminate the possibility of lazy responding biasing results in favor of Neurath\u2019s ship, we force participants to mark all edges anew after every test without a record of their previous judgment as a guide.\nExperiment 2 inherits the methodological improvements, compares two elicitation procedures, and also takes several additional steps. In the previous studies, participants were pretrained on strength wS and background noise wB . This will not generally be true; learners will normally have to take into account their uncertainty about these sources of noise during inference. Therefore, Experiment 2 focuses on cases where participants are not pretrained\non w. Additionally, our framework makes predictions about participants\u2019 problem representation that go beyond how it should manifest in final structure judgments and intervention choices. Specifically, our local intervention schema proposes that people focus on subparts of the overall problem during learning, switching between these by comparing their current local uncertainty. Experiment 2 probes these assumptions by asking learners for confidence judgments about the edges in the model during learning, and eliciting free explanations of what interventions are supposed to be testing. When we go on to fit our framework to individuals in the final section of the paper, we are able to code up these free responses in terms of the hypotheses they refer to and compare them to the focuses predicted by our local uncertainty schema.\nExperiment 1: Learning larger causal models Our first new experiment looks at learning in harder problems with a range of wS and wB and a mixture of 3- and 4-variable problems, asking whether we now see a clearer signature of Neurath\u2019s ship, simple endorsement or win-stay,lose-sample style local updating or of local focus during interventions selection."}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Participants", "text": "120 participants (68 male, mean\u00b1SD age 33 \u00b1 9) were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk14, split randomly so that 30 performed in each of 4 conditions.

Within these, the sparseness of the causal connections varied between a single connection (devices 1 and 6) and fully connected (devices 5 and 10).\nThere were two different levels of causal strength wS \u2208 [.9, 0.75] and two different levels of background noise wB \u2208 [.1, .25] making 2 \u00d7 2 = 4 between-subjects conditions.

Each device was represented as several gray circles on a white background (see Figure 6). Participants were told that the circles were components of a causal system of binary variables, but were not given any further cover story. Initially, all components were inactive and no connection was marked between them. Participants performed tests by clicking on the components, setting them at one of three states \u201cfixed on\u201d, \u201cfixed off\u201d and \u201cfree-to-vary\u201d, then clicking \u201ctest\u201d and observing what happened to the \u201cfree-to-vary\u201dcomponents as a result. The observations were of temporary activity (graphically, activated components would turn green and wobble).\nAs in Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015), participants registered their best guess about the underlying structure after each test. They did this by clicking between the components to select either no connection, or a forward or backward connection (represented as black arrows). Participants were incentivised to be accurate, but unlike in Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015), payments were based on randomly selected time points rather than the final judgments.\nParticipants completed instructions familiarizing them with the task interface; the interpretation of arrows as (probabilistic) causal connections; the incentives for judgment accuracy. To train w, participants were told explicitly and then shown unconnected components and forced to test them several times. The frequency with which the components activated reflected the true background noise level. They were then shown a set of two-component causal systems in which component \u201cx\u201d was a cause of \u201cy\u201d, and were forced to test these systems several times with component x fixed on. This indicated that the frequency with which y activated reflected\nthe level of wS combined with the background noise they had already learned.\nAfter completing the instructions, participants had to answer four comprehension check questions. If they got any wrong they had to go back to the start of the instructions and try again. Then, participants solved a practice problem randomly drawn from the problem set. They then faced the test problems in random order, with randomly oriented unlabeled components. They performed six tests on each three variable problem, and eight tests on each four variable problem. After the final test for each problem they received feedback telling them the true connections.\nTo ensure that participants\u2019 judgments were always genuine directed acyclic graphs, participants were told in the instructions that the true causal structure would not contain a loop. Unlike in Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015), if participants tried to draw a model containing a cyclic structure they would see a message saying \u201cyou have drawn connections that make a loop, change or remove one to continue\u201d.\nAs in Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015) conditions information and information + summary, participants could hover their mouse over a button for a reminder of the key instructions during the task, but unlike condition information + summary, they saw no record of their previous tests and outcomes.\nThe task can be tried out at http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lagnado-lab/el/ns sup."}, {"heading": "Results and discussion", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Judgments", "text": "In spite of the considerably greater noise and complexity than Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015), participants performed significantly above chance in all four conditions (comparing to chance performance of 13 , participants scores differed significantly by t-test with p < .001 for all four conditions).

Performance declined as background noise wB increased F (1, 118) = 4.3, \u03b72 = .04, p = .04 but there was no evidence for a relationship with strength wS F (1, 118) = 2.7, \u03b72 = .04, p = 0.1.

In contrast, random or posterior sampling lead to quite different signatures with larger jumps being more probable. Choices simulated from Neurath\u2019s ship and simple endorsement were more sequentially dependent than participants\u2019 on average but have the expected decreasing shape. Win-stay, lose sample produces a different pattern with a maximum at zero changes but a second peak in the same location as for posterior sampling but has an average edit distance very close to that averaged over participants. However, we expect any random or inattentive responding to inflate average edit distances, and indeed find a strong negative correlation between edit distance and score F (1, 118) = 34, \u03b2 = \u22126.7, \u03b72 = .34, p < .001. A simple way to illustrate this is to compare the edits of higher and lower performers. Scores of 2245 or more differ significantly from chance performance (around 1545 ) by \u03c7 2 test. The 79 participants that scored 22 or more made markedly smaller edits than those that scored under 22 (0.85\u00b10.95 compared to 1.3\u00b1 1.12 for three variable, and 1.4\u00b1 1.5 compared to 2.4\u00b1 1.8 for four variable problems), putting the clearly successful participants patterns closer to the \u201cNeurath\u2019s ship\u201d and \u201csimple endorser\u201d simulations.

It would also shift dramatically over trials always favoring \u201cone-on\u201d interventions for the first trials but these dropping below 50% of choices by the final test. Participants\u2019 choices were much less reactive to condition or trial. There were no clear differences in intervention choices by condition (see supplementary figures available at http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lagnado-lab/el/ns sup) but participants were a little more likely to select \u201cone on\u201d interventions on their first test 57% compared to their last 50% test t(238) = 1.7, p = .01. Like the ideal or the effects focused simulations, and like in Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015), learners favored \u201cone-on\u201d tests. However, in line with an edge or confirmation they also selected a substantial number of \u201ctwo-on\u201d and \u201cone-on, oneoff\u201d interventions, doing so on early as well as late tests while the ideal learner only predicted using \u201cone-on, one-off\u201d tests on the last few trials.

The overall pattern was not clearly consistent with any one local focus but might be consistent with a mixture of all three.\nExperiment 2: Unknown strengths In this experiment, we focused on cases where participants are not pretrained on w (see Appendix A for the computational level details of how to incorporate uncertainty over w in model inference and intervention choice).16\nWe took advantage of the fact that participants would experience substantially greater uncertainty given ignorance about w to assess their ability to estimate local uncertainty based on recently observed data Dtr in order to choose where to focus subsequent tests. This is central to any scheme for intervention selection. Thus, in Experiment 3, we elicited the participants\u2019 confidence about the edges in each judgment. If participants track local uncertainties based on recent evidence, we should expect these to correlate with uncertainties given Dtr. In particular, given the representation associated with Neurath\u2019s ship, we might also expect the local confidences to be evaluated while leaning on the rest of the model for support. This means they should reflect conditional uncertainty in the edge H(Eij |E\\ij ,Dtr; Ctr) more closely than the marginal uncertainty H(Eij |Dtr; Ctr) which involves averaging across all the possible states of the other edges.\nWe also elicited predictions about the outcome of each chosen test before the outcome was revealed. If participants maintained only a single hypothesis, we expected this to be reflected in their predictions. Thus, for a Neurath\u2019s ship learner, it would be predominantly the predictive distribution under their current hypothesis rather than the average across models.\nFinally, in Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015) and Experiment 1, participants\u2019 intervention selections showed hints of being motivated by a mixture of local aspects of the overall uncertainty, with overall patterns most consistent with focus on a mixture of different local\n16Experiments 2 is also reported briefly in Bramley, Dayan, and Lagnado (2015) but without discussion of the intervention choices or current model.\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf \u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf \u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\nBackground = .1 Background = .25\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n0.9 0.75 0.9 0.75 Strength\nS co\nre\nNorms \u25cf active\npassive random\nModels \u25cf\n\u25cf \u25cf\nNS SE WSLS\na) Performance\nThree components Four components\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0 2 4 6 0 2 4 6 Edits\nP ar\ntic ip\nan ts\nModels NS SE WSLS\nNorms posterior random\nb) Sequential dependence\nc) Intervention quality\nd) Intervention choices\naspects of uncertainty.

Like in Experiment 1, there were two causal strength conditions wS \u2208 [0.9, 0.75] and two background noise conditions wB \u2208 [0.1, 0.25]. However, unlike Experiment 1, participants were not trained on these parameters, but only told that: \u201cthe connections do not always work\u201d, and \u201csometimes components can activate by chance\u201d.\nTo assess the extent the different reporting conditions drove lower sequential dependence in Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015) relative to Experiment 1, we examined two reporting conditions between subjects: remain and disappear. In the remain condition, judgments stayed on the screen into the next test, so participants did not have to change anything if they wanted to register the same judgment at t as at t \u2212 1. In the disappear condition, the previous judgment disappeared as soon as participants entered a new test. They then had explicitly to make a choice for every connection after each test.\nIn addition to the structure judgments and interventions, we also elicited additional probability measures from participants. First, after selecting a test, but before seeing the outcome, participants were asked to predict what would happen to the variables they had left free. To do this they would set a slider for each variable they had left free to vary. The left pole of the slider was labeled \u201cSure off\u201d, the right pole \u201cSure on\u201dand the middle setting indicated maximal uncertainty (Figure 8a). Second, after drawing their best guess about the causal model by setting each edge between the variables, participants were asked how sure they were about each edge. Again they would respond by setting a slider, this time between \u201cGuess\u201d on the left indicating maximal uncertainty and \u201cSure\u201d on the right indicating high confidence that edge judgment was correct (Figure 8b). Participants were trained and tested on interpretation of the slider extremes and midpoints in an additional interactive page during the instructions.\nParticipants faced the six devices in random order, with six tests per device followed by feedback as in Experiments 1 and 2. Then they faced one additional test problem. On this problem, the true structure was always a chain (Figure 9, device 7). On this final problem, participants did not have to set sliders. Instead, after they selected each test, but before seeing its outcome, they were asked why they had selected that intervention. Labels would appear on the nodes and participants were invited to \u201cExplain why you chose this combination of fixed and unfixed components. Use labels \u2018A\u2019 \u2018B\u2019, \u2018C\u2019 to talk about particular components or connections\u201d in a text box that would appear below the device. Responses were constrained to be at least 5 characters long. The chain (device 3) was chosen for this problem because in Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015) and Experiments 1 and 2, participants often did not select the crucial Do[x = 1, y = 0] intervention that would allow them to distinguish a chain from a fully connected model (device 5) making this an interesting case for exploring divergence between participants\u2019 behavior and ideal active learning.\nFinally, at the end of the experiment participants were asked to estimate the reliability wS of the true connections: \u201cIn your opinion, how reliable were the devices? i.e. How frequently would\nfixing a cause component ON make the effect component turn ON too?\u201d and the level of background noise wB : \u201cIn your opinion, how frequently did components activate by themselves (when they were not fixed by you, or caused by any of the device\u2019s other components)?\u201d by setting sliders between \u201c0% (never)\u201d and \u201c100% (always)\u201d.\nA demo of Experiment 2 can be viewed at http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lagnado-lab/el/\nns sup."}, {"heading": "Results and discussion", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Judgments", "text": "As in the experiments where participants were trained on w, accuracy was significantly higher than chance in all conditions (all 8 t statistics > 6.1 all p values < 0.001) and underperformed a Bayes optimal observer observing the same data as them.

A subset of the data was then checked and the categories were refined to better delineate their responses with minimal membership ambiguity.\nThe eight resulting categories were:\n1. The participant just wanted to learn about one specific connection. [Corresponding to\nedge focused testing]\n2. The participant wanted to learn about two specific connections.\n3. The participant wanted to learn about all three connections. [Corresponding to globally\nfocused testing]\n4. The participant wanted to learn what a particular component can affect but did not men-\ntion a specific pattern of connections. [Corresponding to effect focused testing]\n5. The participant wanted to test / check / confirm their current hypothesis. [Correspond-\ning to confirmatory testing]\n6. The participant wanted to learn about the randomness in the system (as opposed to the\nlocation of the connections). [Corresponding to a focus on learning about noise rather than structure]\n7. The participant chose randomly / by mistake / to use up unwanted tests / they say they\ndid not understand what they are doing /it is clear they were not engaging with the task.\n8. The participant\u2019s explanation was complex / underspecified / did not seem to fall in any\nof the above categories.\nA supplementary file (available at http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lagnado-lab/el/ns sup)\ncontains all the materials given to coders and the full set of participant responses. Coders were permitted to assign more than one category per response, but had to select a primary category. When the category referred to particular component label(s), the rater would record these, and when it referred to a specific connection they would record which direction (if specified) and the components involved. These details will be used to facilitate a quantitative comparison between participants\u2019 explanations and our model fits in the next Section. Raters normally just selected one category per response, selecting additional categories on only 8% of trials. Interrater agreement on the primary category was 0.73, and Cohen\u2019s \u03ba = 0.64 \u00b1 0.04, both higher than their respective heuristic criteria for adequacy of 0.7 and 0.6 (Krippendorff, 2012; Landis & Koch, 1977).\nFigure 12, shows the proportion of responses in the different categories across the six trials. On the first trial participants were most likely to be categorized as 4. \u2013 focused on identifying what a particular variable could effect. On subsequent trials they most frequently categorized as 1. \u2013 focusing on learning about a specific connection. Toward the end, explanations became more diverse and were increasingly categorized as 5. \u2013 confirmatory testing or 6. learning about the noise in the system. Individuals almost always gave a range of different explanations across their six tests, falling under 3.0 \u00b1 0.99 different categories on average, with only 5/111 participants providing explanations from the same category all six times (3 all-fours, 1 allthrees. and 1 all-eights).\nExplanation type was predictive of performance F (8, 657) = 13.75, \u03b72 = 0.14, p < 0.001. Taking category 7 \u2013 unprincipled or random intervening \u2013 as the reference category with low average performance of 10.2 points out of a possible 21, categories 1,2,4,5, and 6 were all associated significantly higher final scores [14.5, 12.9, 13.9, 13.9, 13.9] points, all p\u2019s < 0.001."}, {"heading": "Summary of Experiments", "text": "In all these experiments, participants were clearly able to generate plausible causal models but also did so suboptimally. Averaged across participants, final model judgments resembled the posterior over models (e.g. Figures 4c and 9c), however individuals\u2019 trajectories typically exhibited strong sequential dependence, with the probability of moving to a new model decreasing with its edit distance from the previous model. This is consistent with our hypothesis that individuals normally maintain a single hypothesis and update it piece by piece. As found in previous research, participants were worst at separating the direct and indirect causes in the chain (3; 8) and fully-connected (5; 10) models. A closer look at participants\u2019 intervention choices suggests that this was due to a common failure to generate the constrained interventions, such as Do[x = 1, y = 0], necessary to disambiguate these options. The simple endorser model predicts this error by proposing that people ignore the dependencies between the different edges. Our framework provides a more nuanced explanation. Whether a learner will correctly disambiguate these options depends on whether they focus on x \u2212 z before or after\nhaving inferred x \u2192 y and y \u2192 z. If the consider x\u2212 z after, then they will tend to fix y \u201coff\u201d, realizing it is necessary to prevent the indirect path from confounding the outcome of their test. However, if they have no connection marked from x to y or from y to z, they will not expect this confounding activation and so have no motivation to fix y \u201coff\u201d when testing x\u2212 z. Participants\u2019 overall distributions of intervention selections resembled a mixture of edge, effect and confirmation focused testing, but their distributions of choices were relatively invariant across conditions and trials while the efficient learners\u2019 were much more dynamic. Comparison with the final global information gathered revealed that they did not select which variables to target particularly efficiently, leading to a considerable discrepancy between the total information gathered by participants compared to an ideal active learner. However, participants also displayed hints of adaptation of strategy over the trials: with a preference for confirmatory testing, being more likely to fix variables \u201con\u201d when they had children according to their latest hypothesis bt\u22121, and displaying a modest shift toward more constrained interventions in later trials.\nIn Experiment 2 we saw that people were able to identify causal structure effectively without specific parameter knowledge. Comparing a range of plausible prior assumptions about edge reliability wS and the level of background noise wB yielded little difference in judgment or intervention choice predictions. Participants\u2019 overall judgment accuracy was not affected by the remain/disappear reporting condition, but this did affect sequential dependence, especially for lower performers who may have often forgotten their previous judgment when making their next one. The idea, common to the three judgment rules we consider, that people represent one model at a time was also supported by the additional measures elicited from participants during the task. With a single hypothesis rather than distributional beliefs, intervention outcome predictions could only be generated by the current hypothesis rather than averaged and weighted over all possible models. Consistent with this idea, we found participants\u2019 expectation judgments were more in line with their current hypothesis than the marginal likelihoods, although we note that these measures were quite noisy and the effects quite small."}, {"heading": "Modeling individual behavior", "text": "Across all three examined experiments we found a qualitative correspondence, both between our Neurath\u2019s ship simulations and participants\u2019 judgments, and between the two stage local intervention schema and participants interventions.

In order to validate quantitatively which of these models better describes participants\u2019 behavior, we fit the models to the data and assessed their competence relative also to win-stay, lose-sample and simple endorsement.

An average search length parameter \u03bb controlling the probability of searching for differ-\nent lengths k on each belief update.\n2. A search behavior parameter \u03c9 controlling how strongly the learner moves toward the\nmore likely state for an edge when updating it (recalling that \u03c9 = 1 leads to probability matching, while \u03c9 =\u221e leads to deterministic hill climbing and \u03c9 = 0 to making random local edits).\n3. A lapse parameter controlling a mixture between the model predictions and a uniform\ndistribution.\nIncluding the last parameter into equation 5, this resulted in the following equation\nP (bt = m|Dtr, Ctr,w, bt\u22121, \u03c9, \u03bb) = (1\u2212 ) \u2211\u221e\n0\n\u03bbke\u2212\u03bb\nk!

One is the probability \u03c1 \u2208 [0, 1] with which the belief state is updated from bt\u22121 include extra edges from any currently fixed \u201con\u201d node(s) to any activated nodes and to exclude edges from any currently fixed \u201con\u201d node(s) to any non-activated nodes (we write bt\u22121+SE). With the complementary probability 1 \u2212 \u03c1, it stays the same as bt\u22121. As with the NS model we also included a lapse parameter mixing in a probability of choosing something at random, giving\nP (bt = m|d,w) = (1\u2212 )(\u03c1 bt\u22121+SE + (1\u2212 \u03c1)b t\u22121) + Unif(M) (14)\nWin-stay, lose-sample (WSLS) (Bonawitz et al., 2014) predicts that participants stick with their current model bt\u22121 with probability p(dt|bt\u22121,w, ct) or else draw a sample from the full posterior with probability 1 \u2212 p(dt|bt\u22121,w, ct). The fitted version of this model had a single lapse parameter giving\nP (bt = m|Dt,w) = (1\u2212 ) ( (1\u2212P (dt|bt\u22121,w, ct))P (M |Dt,w)t+P (dt|bt\u22121,w, ct)[m = bt\u22121] ) + Unif(M)\n(15)\nThe final model, Rational was a variant of the Bayes-optimal observer (Section 2) that attempted to select the maximum a posteriori causal structure maxP (M |Dt,w;Ct) with each judgment, with a soft maximization (Luce, 1959) governed by inverse temperature parameter\n\u03b8 and a lapse parameter . For this, we considered\nP (bt = m|Dt,w) = (1\u2212 ) exp(P (M |D t,w)t\u03b8)\u2211\nm\u2032\u2208M exp(P (m \u2032|Dt,w)t\u03b8)\n+ Unif(M) (16)\nBaseline is a parameter-free baseline that assumes each judgment to be a random draw from\nall possible causal models\np(bt = m) = Unif(M) (17)\n(leading to a probability of approximately 13 for each edge).\nOne concern with this baseline is that judgments might exhibit sequential dependence yet be unrelated to data Dtr. Therefore we also considered a baseline variant of the NS model in which the search behavior parameter \u03c9 was fixed to 0, resulting in a (R)andom (E)dit model (NS-RE) that walks randomly around the hypothesis space for k steps on each update. For this model, small k simply denotes more inertia.\nEach of these belief models output a likelihood based on the probability that the model assigns to a belief of bt, given the most recent outcome dt (SE), outcomes since the last belief change Dtr (NS), or all outcomes Dt (WSLS, Rational), and the most recent judgment bt\u22121. Because the choice of prior for Experiment 2 made negligible difference to our results, we only report models assuming uniform (UU) priors on w. For Experiment 2, we also marginalized over the unknown values of w rather than conditioning as in the other experiments as detailed in Appendix B."}, {"heading": "Evaluation", "text": "To compare these models quantitatively, we used maximum likelihood optimization as implemented by R\u2019s optim function to fit the model separately to each of the 370 participants across all three experiments.18 We used Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC, Schwarz, 1978) to compare the models while accommodating their differing numbers of parameters. Baseline acts as the null model for computing BICs and pseudo-R2s (Dobson, 2010) for the other models. In Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015) participants were not forced to select something for each edge immediately, although once they did so they could not return to \u201cunspecified\u201d, and they could also respond with cyclic causal model if they wanted. Therefore, we fit only the 75% of tests where the participants report a fully specified non-cyclic belief, taking the bt\u22121 to be the unconnected model on the first fully specified judgment, as we do with b0 in the other Experiments. Recalculating the transition probabilities on the fly in the optimization of \u03c9 was infeasibly computationally intensive for the four-variable problems. So for Experiment 1 we first fit all three parameters to the three-variable problems only, then used the best fitting \u03c9 parameters from this fit when fitting the \u03bb and on the full data. In Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015) and Experiment 2 we were able to fit all three parameters."}, {"heading": "Results and discussion", "text": "Table 3 details the results of the model fits to all experiments. Summed across all participants, NS has the lowest total BIC (93381) with the SE in second place (94326), followed by\n18In Appendix B we provide additional detail on how the models were fit.\nWSLS with (97643), then NS-RE (101837), Rational (1207209) and finally Baseline with (149313). NS was also the best fitting model for Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015) and Experiment 1, with SE winning in Experiment 2. Thus, all three heuristics substantially beat an exact Bayesian inference account of causal judgment here, but Neurath\u2019s ship, with its ability to capture a graded dependence on prior beliefs, outperformed WSLS substantially, and the heuristic SE to a lesser degree. In terms of number of individuals best fit, Table 3 shows a broad spread across models: WSLS \u2013 102, NS \u2013 85, SE \u2013 80, NS-RE \u2013 70, Rational \u2013 28 , Baseline \u2013 4.\nThe diversity of individual fits across strategies raises the question of the identifiability of the different models. To assess how reliably genuine followers of the different proposed strategies would be identified by our modeling procedure, we simulated participants using the fitted parameters for each model for each of the actual participants in all three examined experiments. We then fit all six models to these simulated participants report the rates at which simulations are best-captured by each model. Table 4 provides the complete results for this recovery analysis. Overall, the generating model was recovered 74% of the time for Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015), 82% for Experiment 1 and 75% for Experiment 2 (chance\nwould be 17%). In all three experiments, data generated by Baseline, WSLS and SE was nearly always correctly recaptured, indicating that we can treat cases where participants are well described by these models as genuine. Additionally NS almost never captured data generated by any of the other models, providing reassurance that NS is not simply fitting participants who are doing something more in line with SE or WSLS. However, data actually generated by NS was frequently recaptured by the NS-RE (random edit) null model that makes NS-style local edits but does not preferentially approach more likely models. This was true in the majority of cases in Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015) and Experiment 2. Some of the cases where NS-RE captures NS-generated simulations are based on participants who were better described by NS-RE in the first place (e.g. whose search behavior was too random to justify \u03c9\u2019s inclusion). We find a similar effect whereby simulated Rational participants with relatively low \u03b8s or high s are more parsimoniously described by Baseline. This is supported by looking at the more complex four variable problems in Experiment 1, NS simulations were identified the majority of the time, and when restricted to simulations based on parameters from participants who were actually best described by NS, 24/27 were recovered successfully. Thus it is plausible that some of the 70 NR-RE participants were infact doing something more in line with NS. There is a suggestion of this in Experiment 1, where the mean accuracy of the NS-RE participants is commensurate with SE, WSLS and NS.\nThe performance of a handful of participants \u2013 10 in Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015), and 19 in Experiment 2 \u2013 were best fit by the Rational model, which has one fewer parameter than NS. Naturally, these participants performed particularly well, scoring near ceiling in Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015) (identifying 14.0 of the 15 connections) and as high as the ideal learning simulations in Experiment 2 \u2013 14.7/21 compared to an average of 15.5 for perfect Bayesian integration. This, along with the lower recovery rates for these experiments, suggests that their design \u2013 both being motivated primarily to look closely at intervention choice \u2013 may not have been difficult enough to separate the process from the normative predictions about the judgments.\nFigures 13a and b show the range of the fitted \u03bb and \u03c9 parameters under NS. In line with our predictions, participants\u2019 average fitted search lengths (\u03bb) were mainly small, with medians between 1 and 2 in all three experiments.19 Because this parameter merely encodes a participant\u2019s average search length this means that the same participant would sometimes not search at all, staying exactly where they are (k = 0), or might also sometimes search much longer (e.g. k \u03bb). The median fitted \u03c9s of 6, 4 and 9.2 across the three experiments are suggestive of moderate hill-climbing. A substantial number of participants had very large values of \u03c9 indicative of near-deterministic hill climbing. We discuss this trade-off further in the General Discussion. However, note that we were only able to fit these values to the easier three variable problems. It might be that the largest values would have been tempered if they could have been fit to the four variable problems as well.\n19A few participants made judgments that were sequentially anti-correlated leading to \u03bb parameters at the limit of the optimization routine\u2019s precision and correspondingly large standard deviations in Experiments 1 and 2."}, {"heading": "Interventions", "text": ""}, {"heading": "Models", "text": "We compared our local model of intervention choice (Section 4) to a globally-focused and a baseline model. Each intervention model output a likelihood for an intervention choice of ct, depending on Dtr, Ctr and bt\u22121. We compared the overall distribution of participants\u2019 intervention selections and final performance with edge focused, effect focused and confirmation focused tests. We found that none of these models alone closely resembled participants\u2019 response patterns, but overall distributions were consistent with a mixture of different types of local tests. This was also supported by the the free-response coding in Experiment 2, showing that participants would typically report targeting a mixture of specific edges, effects of specific variables and confirming the current hypothesis. Therefore, we considered four locally driven intervention selection models, one for each of the three foci, plus a mixture.\nFor the edge model, the possible foci L included the 3 (or 6) edges in the model. For the effect model, it comprised the 3 components (or 4 in the 4-variable case). The confirmation model always had the same focus \u2013 comparing bt to null b0 of no connectivity.

In three experiments, we found that participants\u2019 judgments some-\nwhat reflected the true posterior, while exhibiting sequential dependencies. Further, participants\u2019 choices of interventions reflected average expected information, but were insufficiently reactive to the evidence that had already been observed and were consistent with being locally focused.\nWe could capture participants\u2019 judgment patterns by assuming that they maintained a single causal model rather than a full distribution. We proposed that participants considered local changes to improve the ability of their single model to explain the latest data and compared this account to two other proposals, one based on the idea that participants occasionally resample from the full posterior, and the other, a heuristic based on ignoring the possibility of indirect effects. While our Neurath\u2019s ship proposal fit best overall, all three proposals had merit, with simple endorsement winning out in Experiment 2 and more individuals better fit by win-stay lose-sample.\nWe captured participants\u2019 interventions by assuming they focused stochastically on different local aspects of the overall uncertainty and tried to resolve these, leading to behavior that was comparatively invariant to the prior. Our modelling suggested a broad spread of local focuses both between and within participants.\nBy casting our modeling in the language of machine learning, we were able to make strong connections between our Neurath\u2019s ship model and established techniques for approximating distributions\u2013sequential Monte-Carlo particle filtering and MCMC (specifically Gibbs) sampling.

We discuss some of these here."}, {"heading": "Measurement effects", "text": "In order to explore incremental belief change it was necessary to elicit multiple judgments and to make two strong assumptions: (1) that these judgments reflected participants\u2019 true and latest beliefs; and (2) that the repeated elicitations did not fundamentally alter learning processes. To mitigate problems of these, we both incentivised participants to draw their best and latest guess at every time point during the tasks, and examined different reporting conditions to explore the influence of the elicitations on the learning process.\nIn Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015) and the remain condition in Experiment 2, participants could leave parts of their hypothesis untouched if they did not want to change them. This had the strength of being minimally invasive; it did not push the learner to reconsider an edge that they would otherwise not have done merely because they have been asked about it again. However this came at the cost of conflating genuine incremental change\nin the learner\u2019s psychological representation with response laziness. To assuage this concern, in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 disappear, we removed the participants\u2019 previous judgment after they had seen the outcome of the subsequent intervention, meaning that they would have to remember and re-report any edges they had previously judged (and not yet reconsidered). The slight reduction of dependence between remain and disappear conditions in Experiment 2, is consistent with the idea that being forced to re-report edges made it more likely that they would be reconsidered and potentially changed.\nThe Neurath\u2019s ship approach is related to anchor-and-adjust models (Einhorn & Hogarth, 1986; Petrov & Anderson, 2005) of sequential magnitude estimation. Hogarth and Einhorn found that when mean estimates are repeatedly elicited from participants as they see a sequence of numbers, the sequence of responses can be captured by a process whereby one stores a single value and adjusts it a portion of the way toward each new observed value. When judgments were elicited at the end of the sequence, participants behaved more like they had stored a subset of the values and averaged them at the end. In the same way, we can think of Neurath\u2019s ship as a process in which the current model acts as an anchor, and adjustments are made toward new data as it is observed. However, the higher complexity of causal inference, and the greater storage requirements for the individual episodes will presumably lead to greater pressure to use a sequential strategy rather than store. Arguably, step-by-step elicitation is a closer analogue to real-world causal inference than end-of-sequence because causal beliefs are presumably in frequent use while learning instances may be spread out, with no clear start or end."}, {"heading": "Acyclicity", "text": "We adopted the directed acyclic graph as our model of causal representation here because it is a standard approach in the literature and is mathematically convenient. Furthermore, cyclic graphs were quite rare choices in Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015) (where participants were permitted to draw them). Thus, we simply opted to to rule them out in the instructions in later experiments.\nHowever, in tasks where people draw causal models of real-world phenomena, they often draw cyclic or reciprocal relationships (Kim & Ahn, 2002; Nikolic & Lagnado, 2015), and many real world processes are characterized by bidirectional causality, such as supply and demand in economics or homeostasis in biological systems. There are various ways to represent dynamic systems. One proposal is the dynamic Bayesian network (Dean & Kanazawa, 1989), which can be \u201cunfolded\u201d to form regular acyclic network with causal influences passing forward through time. Another is the chain graph (Lauritzen & Richardson, 2002), in which undirected edges are mixed with directed edges and used to model the equilibria of the cyclic parts of the system.\nExploring these structures would require a change in the the semantics of the experiment so that people could understand what they were reporting in the presence of dynamical interactions. However, given this, NS would offer a way of performing sequential, on-line, inference for such structures, using standard likelihood calculations for dynamic Bayes nets and chain graphs."}, {"heading": "Evaluation of evidence", "text": "Another pragmatic limitation of the current modeling was the assumption of the noisy-OR functional form for the true underlying causal models. While we did take care to train participants on the sources of noise in both Experiments and the exact values in Bramley, Lagnado, and Speekenbrink (2015), our own past work suggests that people may have simpler ways of evaluating the how likely models would be to produce different patterns \u2013 for example, in Bramley, Dayan, and Lagnado (2015), we found participants\u2019 judgments could be captured by assuming they lumped sources of noise together and just counted the number of surprising outcomes under each model.\nOne possibility is that people actually formed likelihood estimates through simulation with an internal causal model. For instance, one might perform a mental intervention, activating a component of one\u2019s own internal causal model and keeping track of where the activation propagates. By simulating multiple times, a learner could estimate the likelihood of different outcomes under their current model (Hamrick, Smith, Griffiths, & Vul, 2015), and by simulating under variations of the model, the learner could compare likelihoods generated on the fly. This simulation-based view provides a possible explanation for why participants more readily accommodated internal noise wS than background noise wB . The former can be \u201cbuilt in\u201d to the inferred connections in their model and reveal itself in mental simulation, while wB is more of a mathematical \u201ccatch all\u201d for all possible influences coming from outside the variables under focus. The Neurath\u2019s ship perspective suggests that people lean on their surrounding network of assumptions about surrounding causes, controlling for these if they get in the way of local inference. By being omnipresent and affecting all the variables equally wB was not possible to accommodate in this way.\nFuture experiments and modeling might relax the assumption of noisy-OR likelihoods and allow induction of more diverse functional forms, or focus on well known domains where priors can be measured before the task. Another approach might be to render the noisy-OR formalization more transparent by visualizing the sources of exogenous noise alongside the target variables, for instance displaying varying numbers of nuisance background variables on screen for different background noise conditions."}, {"heading": "Antifoundationalism", "text": "The core of Neurath\u2019s ship is the strong assumption that people consider only a single global hypothesis and make local changes within this. This is the \u201cantifoundationalism\u201d captured by the Duhem\u2013Quine thesis \u2014 any local theoretical claim is necessarily supported by surrounding assumptions. However, this may be too strong for some of the easier problems we considered here where the worlds may have been small and constrained enough for some people to reason at the global level. For the three variable problems in particular, some participants may have been able to consider alternatives at the level of the whole model, and thus able to shift from common cause to chain etc with a single step.\nWhile participants\u2019 judgments showed high sequential dependence, they did occasionally change their model abruptly. The theory of unexpected uncertainty (Yu & Dayan, 2003), and substantial work on changepoint tasks (Speekenbrink & Shanks, 2010) are associated with the\nnotion that people will sometimes \u201cstart over\u201d if they are having consistently poor predictions from their existing model. This relates to the idea, in philosophy of science, of a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d (Kuhn, 1962). The current Neurath\u2019s ship models do not naturally capture this but accommodate occasional large jumps by assuming a variable search length (k), meaning the search will sometimes be long enough to allow the learner to move to a radically different model in a single update. However we might also extend the Neurath\u2019s ship framework to include a threshold on prediction accuracy below which a learner will start afresh, for example by randomly sampling a model, or sampling from a hitherto unexplored part of the space. At present this is captured by the probability of sampling a new bt at random on a given trial (which ranged between a probability of .03 in Experiment 2 and .2 in Experiment 1)."}, {"heading": "Selective memory", "text": "We assumed that participants\u2019 judgment updates were based on the recent data Dtr, collected since the last time they changed their hypothesis. This is quite frugal in the current context, as the learner rarely has to store more than a few tests worth of evidence. It also captures the idea of semanticization \u2013 that as one gradually absorbs episodic evidence into one\u2019s hypothesis, it becomes safe to forget it.\nHowever, the particular choice of Dtr is certainly a simplification. People may frequently remember evidence from before their latest change, and fail to store recent evidence, especially once their beliefs become settled. They might also collect summary evidence at the level of individual edges, counting how often pairs of components activate together for example, or remember evidence about some components but not others, or only store evidence when it is surprising under the current model. In order to fit the models it was necessary to make simplifying assumptions that captured some form of halfway house between remembering everything and relying entirely on your hypothesis. Future studies might probe exactly what learners can remember during and after learning to get a finer-grained understanding of the trade-off between remembering evidence and absorbing it into beliefs.\nRelated to this, we fit a static search behavior parameter to participants, finding evidence of moderate hill climbing. However, a more realistic depiction might be something more akin to simulated annealing (Hwang, 1988). Learners might begin searching with more exploratory moves \u03c9 \u2248 1 so as to explore the space broadly, and transition toward hill climbing \u03c9 = \u221e as they start to choose what judgment to report. Alternatively they might gradually reduce their search length k as pressure to settle on a model increases."}, {"heading": "Alternative approximations and representations", "text": "The choice of Gibbs sampling, together with a single particle approximation, is just one of numerous possible models of structure inference. For example we found (data not shown) fairly good fits by replacing Gibbs sampling with a form of Metropolis-Hastings MCMC sampling \u2013 using an MC3 proposal and acceptance distribution (Madigan & Raftery, 1994; Madigan, York, & Allard, 1995). The two approaches make similar behavioral predictions but differ somewhat in their internal architecture \u2013 a Metropolis-Hastings sampler would first generate a wholesale alternative to the current belief, then make an accept-reject decision about whether\nto accept this alternative, while the Gibbs sampler focuses on one subpart at a time and updates this conditional on the rest. Ultimately, the Gibbs sampler did a better job, helping justify the broader ideas of locality of inference implicit in the Neurath\u2019s ship proposal.\nAn interesting alternative approach to complex model induction via local computations (Fernbach & Sloman, 2009; Waldmann et al., 2008), comes from variational Bayes (Bishop, 2006; Weierstrass, 1902). The idea behind this is that one can simplify inference by replacing an intractable distribution, here the distribution over all possible models, with a simpler one which has degrees of freedom that can be used to allow it to fit as best as possible. A common choice of simpler distribution involves factorization, with a multiplicative combination of a set of simpler parametrized distributions. Thus, for causal inference one might make a mean-field approximation (Georges, Kotliar, Krauth, & Rozenberg, 1996) and suppose the true distribution over models factorizes into independent distributions for each causal connection. Divergence between this approximation and the full model can then be minimized mathematically by updating each of the local distributions in turn (Jaakkola, 2001). This provides a different perspective on global inference based on local updates. Rather than a process of local search where only a single model is represented at any time, variational Bayes suggests people maintain many local distributions and try to minimize the inconsistencies between them. The biases induced by this process make the two approaches distinguishable in principle (Sanborn, 2015), meaning that an interesting avenue for future work may be to design experiments that distinguish between the two approaches to approximation in cognition . The truth in our case may be somewhere in between. For instance, in the current work, we assumed people were able to use recent evidence to estimate their local uncertainty conditional on the rest of the structure, and thus choose where to focus interventions. To the extent that learners really represent their beliefs with lots of local uncertainties, their representation becomes increasingly variational.\nChoosing interventions aboard Neurath\u2019s ship The largest difference in intervention choices between experiments was that in Experiment 2 constrained interventions (e.g. Do[x = 1, y = 0]) were chosen much more frequently. One explanation for this is that participants might have been forced to focus their attention more narrowly in Experiment 2, to compensate for their additional uncertainty about the noise by using more focused testing. Another possibility is that the different subject pools drove this difference. It is possible that mTurk\u2019s older and educationally diverse participants (Experiments 1) gathered evidence differently from the young scientifically trained UCL undergraduates (Experiment 2). This might have driven the tendency toward more tightly constrained tests in in Experiment 2.\nThe idea that people relied on asking a mixture of different types of locally focused question, was borne out by our analysis of the coding of participants\u2019 free explanations. Explanations almost always focused on one specific aspect of the problem, most frequently on a particular causal connection, or what a particular component can affect, but also sometimes on parameter uncertainty or, on later tests, confirming their current hypothesis. Furthermore, participants almost always referred to a mix of different local query types over the course of their six tests. The apparent shift toward confirmatory testing on the last trial is sensible, since par-\nticipants knew they would not have more tests to follow up anything new they might discover. Indeed this shift would be normative in various settings.\nSubjective explanations are notoriously problematic (Ericsson & Simon, 1980, 1993; Russo, Johnson, & Stephens, 1989). Therefore, we must be careful in interpreting these results. One common issue is that eliciting responses concurrently with performing a task can change behavior, invalidating conclusions about the original behavior. We minimized this issue by eliciting explanations just after each intervention was chosen, before its outcome was revealed. Additionally, we did not find any difference in the distribution of interventions on the free response trials and those chosen the first time participants identified the chains structure.\nA second issue is that there are limits on the kinds of processes people can describe effectively in natural language, with rule based explanations being typically easier to express than those involving more complex statistical weighting and averaging. That is, even if someone weighed several factors in coming to a decision, they might explain this by mentioning only the most significant, or recently considered of these factors, falsely appearing to have relied on a one-reason decision strategy. There is an active debate about this, including suggestions that people\u2019s explanations for their choices are, in general, post-hoc rationalizations rather than genuine descriptions of process (Dennett, 1991; Johansson, Hall, Sikstro\u0308m, & Olsson, 2005), but also refutations of this interpretation (Newell & Shanks, 2014).\nIn sum, taken with appropriate caution, we suggest that this analysis does provides a valuable window on participants\u2019 subjective sense of their active testing, with their relatively specific focus on one aspect of the uncertainty at a time consistent with the idea that they rely on a mixture of heuristic questions.\nThe models pinned down interventions less tightly than beliefs in the sense that there was a great deal of spread in the individuals best fit across the models, and the proportional reductions in BIC were smaller. There are various possible reasons for this. Firstly, the models of belief change generally predicted one or few likely models, whereas there are typically many interventions of roughly equal informativeness to an ideal learner (see Figure 3), which could be performed in many different orders. This sets the bar for predictability for interventions much lower than for the causal judgments.\nSecondly, to the extent that learners chose interventions based on a reduced encoding of the hypothesis space, we are also forced to average over our additional uncertainty about exactly which hypotheses or alternatives they were considering at the moment of choice (Markant & Gureckis, 2010).\nA third issue is that of whether and how learners represented current uncertainty, and recruited this in choosing what to focus on. In the current work we assumed that learners were somewhat able to track the current local uncertainties and use these to choose what to target next. The modeling revealed that, relative to the local intervention schema, the majority of participants did tend to focus on the areas of high current uncertainty (shown by the predominantly positive \u03c1 in Figure 13 d) but we do not yet have a model for how they did this. It is plausible that learners used a heuristic to estimate their local confidence. For example, a simple option would be to accrue confidence in an edge, (or analogously in the the descendants\nof a variable or in the current hypothesis) for every search step for which it is considered and remains unchanged, reducing confidence every time it changes. In this way confidence in locales that survive more data and search become stronger, approximately mimicking reduction in local uncertainty.\nWe considered just three of a multitude of possible choices of local focus. These encompass most extant proposals for human search heuristics, encapsulating modular (Markant et al., 2015) constraint seeking (Ruggeri & Lombrozo, 2014) and confirmatory (Klayman & Ha, 1989) testing, placing all three within a unified schema and also showing that many learners dynamically switch between them.\nParticipants\u2019 free responses provided a complementary perspective, suggesting that even initial tests were generated as solutions to uncertainty about some specific subpart of the overall uncertainty space \u2013 often the descendants of some particular variable or the presence of some particular connection. This suggests that the the most important step in an intervention selection may not be the final choice of action but the prior choice of what to focus on next. This is captured in our model, under which the values of different interventions for a chosen focus do not depend on Dt\u22121. This means learners need not do extensive prospective calculation on every test but can learn gradually, for instance through experience and preplay (Pfeiffer & Foster, 2013), which interventions are likely to be informative relative to generic types of local focus. This knowledge could then be transferred to subsequent tests, and translated to tests with different targets \u2013 e.g. if Do[x = 1] is effective for identifying the effects of x then Do[y = 1] will be effective for identifying the effects of y.\nIt is worth noting from these data that even when participants\u2019 interventions were relatively uninformative from the perspective of ideal or even our heuristic learners, their explanations would generally reveal that they were informative with respect to some other question or source of uncertainty. For example, participants\u2019 tests that were uninformative with respect to identifying structure were often revealed, through our free response coding, to have been motivated by a desire to reduce uncertainty about internal wS or background wB noise.20 From this perspective we might think of even the completely uninformative intervention choices (e.g. fixing all the variables) as legitimate tests of illegitimate hypotheses \u2013 e.g.hypotheses that were outside of the space of possibilities we intended participants to consider \u2013 such as whether fixed variables actually always took the states they were fixed to. More research is needed to explicate these internal steps leading up to an active learning action, but the implication based on the current research is that the solution will not require that the learner evaluate all possible outcomes of all possible actions under all possible models, but rather reflect a mixture of heuristics that can guide the gradual improvement of the learner\u2019s current theory."}, {"heading": "The navy of one", "text": "At the start we argued that our Neurath\u2019s ship model could be seen as a single particle combined with an MCMC search. As such, we are claiming Neurath\u2019s ship as a form of bound-\n20We might have extended the computational model of Bayesian inference to incorporate joint inference over models and parameters which would have incorporated this aspect of testing. However, this would have complicated analyses since participants were ultimately only incentivised to identify the right connections\nedly rational approximate Bayesian inference. However, it is important to consider the point at which an approximation becomes so degenerate that it is merely a complicated way to describe a simple heuristic. Many would argue that this line is crossed long before reaching particle filters containing a single particle, or Markov chains lasting only 1 or 2 steps. It is certainly a leap to claim that such a process is calculating a proper posterior.\nOne alternative to starting from a normative computational level account and accepting a distant algorithmic approximation, is to start from the algorithm, i.e., the simple rules, and consider a computational account such as satisficing (Simon, 1982) that provides adequate license. Our account shares two important problems with this, but avoids two others.\nOne shared problem is the provenance of the rules - i.e., the situation-specific heuristics. We saw this in the manifold choice of local foci for the choice of intervention \u2013 we do not have an account of whence these hail. This is a common problem in the context of the adaptive toolbox (Gigerenzer, 2001) \u2013 it is hard to have a theory of the collection of tools.\nA second shared problem follows on from this - namely how to choose which rule to apply under which circumstance. In our case, this is evident again in the mixtures of local focus rules \u2013 we were not able to provide a satisfying account of how participants make their selection of focus on a particular trial. The meta-problem of choosing the correct heuristic is again a common issue for satisficing approaches.\nBy contrast with a toolbox approach, though, our account smoothly captures varying degrees of sophistication between individuals. For instance, with the Take the best heuristic, Gigerenzer, Todd, and ABC Research Group (1999) give an attractive description of one-reason decision making that often outperforms regression in describing people\u2019s decisions from multiple cues. However, subsequent analyses have revealed that participants behave somewhere between the two (Newell & Shanks, 2003; Parpart, Jones, & Love, in revision) often using more than one cue, but certainly less than all the information available. Thus to understand their processing we must be able to express the halfway houses between ideal and overly simplistic processing (Lieder & Griffiths, 2015). In the same way, the approximate Bayesian perspective allows us to express different levels of approximation lying between fully probabilistic and fully heuristic processing, with the simplest form of Neurath\u2019s ship lying at the heuristic end of this road.\nA further benefit of our account is the ease of generalization between tasks. Heuristic models are typically designed for, and are competent at, specific paradigms. Since they lack a more formal relationship with approximate rationality, they are hard to combine or often to apply in different or broader circumstances.\nHere, we assumed that learners made updates at the level of individual directed edges. Again this is just one illustrative choice, but our model is consistent with the idea that the learners altered beliefs by making changes local to arbitrary sub-spaces of an unmanageable learning problem. We showed that so long as the learner\u2019s updates are conditioned on the rest of their model, and are appropriately balanced, the connection to approximate Bayesian inference can be maintained through the ideas of MCMC sampling and a single-particle particle filter. A sophisticated learner might be able to update several edges of their causal model at a\nsingle time, with a more complex proposal distribution. However, on a larger scale this is still likely to be a small subset of all potential relata that a learner has encountered, meaning even the most sophisticated learner must lean on their broader beliefs for support.\nIn lower level cognition, inference takes place over simple quantities like magnitudes and is certainly probabilistic in the sense that humans can achieve near optimal integration of noisy signals in a variety of tasks including estimation (Miyazaki, Nozaki, & Nakajima, 2005) and motor control (e.g. Ko\u0308rding & Wolpert, 2004). At the top end of higher level cognition we have a global world-view, and explicit reasoning characterized by its single track nature. Rather than claiming these are completely different processes (Evans, 2003), the approximate probabilistic inference perspective can accommodate the whole continuum. At the lower level the brain can average over many values, as in particle filtering (Abbott & Griffiths, 2011), with a whole fleet of Neurath\u2019s ships, or via lots of long chains (Gershman et al., 2012; Lieder et al., 2012). In higher level cognition, however, the hypothesis space becomes increasingly unwieldy, and inference becomes increasingly approximate as it must rely on smaller fleets, i.e., fewer hypotheses, and more local alterations in the face of evidence. At the very top we have a navy of one, grappling with a single global model that can only be updated incrementally. It is worth noting that individuals can then play the role of particles again in group behavior (Courville & Daw, 2007), giving us approximate inference all the way up.\nIn sum, retaining the Bayesian machinery is valuable even as it becomes degenerate, because it allows us to express heuristic behavior without resorting to separate process model or abandoning close connections to an appropriate computational level understanding."}, {"heading": "Scope of the theory", "text": "We modeled causal belief change as a process of gradually updating a single representation through local, conditional edits. While we chose to focus on causal structure inference within the causal Bayes net framework here, there is no reason why this approach should be limited to this domain. By taking the Neurath\u2019s ship metaphor to reveal an intuitive answer as to how people sidestep the intractability of rational theory formation (van Rooij et al., 2014), we can start to build more realistic models of how people generate the theories that they do and how and why they get stuck. We might explain the induction and adaptation of many of the rich representations utilized in cognition by analogous processes. Future work could explore the piecemeal induction of models involving multinomial, continuous (Nodelman, Shelton, & Koller, 2002; Pacer & Griffiths, 2011) or latent variables (Lucas, Holstein, & Kemp, 2014); unrestricted functional forms (Griffiths, Lucas, Williams, & Kalish, 2009); hierarchical organization (Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2009; Williamson & Gabbay, 2005); and temporal (Pacer & Griffiths, 2012) and spatial (Battaglia, Hamrick, & Tenenbaum, 2013; Ullman et al., 2012; Ullman, Stuhlmu\u0308ller, Goodman, & Tenenbaum, 2014) semantics.
