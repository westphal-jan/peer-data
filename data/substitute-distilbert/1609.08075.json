Tasks with these low dimensional dense features require models to be more sophisticated to capture the relationships between features. Therefore, non-linear models start to receive more attention as they are often more expressive than linear models.\nTree-based models such as boosted trees (Friedman, 2001) are flexible non-linear models. They can handle categorical features and count data better than other non-linear models like Neural Networks. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, little work has utilized tree-based methods for structured prediction, with the exception of TreeCRF (Dietterich et al., 2004).\nIn this paper, we propose a novel structured learning framework called S-MART (Structured Multiple Additive Regression Trees). Unlike TreeCRF, S-MART is very versatile, as it can be applied to tasks beyond sequence tagging and can be trained under various objective functions. SMART is also powerful, as the high order relationships between features can be captured by nonlinear regression trees.\nWe further demonstrate how S-MART can be applied to tweet entity linking, an important and challenging task underlying many applications including product feedback (Asur and Huberman, 2010) and topic detection and tracking (Mathioudakis and Koudas, 2010). We apply S-MART to\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n08 07\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n6 Se\nentity linking using a simple logistic function as the loss function and propose a novel inference algorithm to prevent overlaps between entities.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We propose a novel structured learning framework called S-MART.

Building on top of S-MART, we propose a novel inference algorithm for nonoverlapping structure with the goal of preventing conflicting entity assignments. (Section 3)\n\u2022 We provide a systematic study of evaluation criteria in tweet entity linking by conducting extensive experiments over major data sets. The results show that S-MART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art entity linking systems, including the system that is used to win the NEEL 2014 challenge (Cano and others, 2014). (Section 4)"}, {"heading": "2 Structured Multiple Additive Regression Trees", "text": "The goal of a structured learning algorithm is to learn a joint scoring function S between an input x and an output structure y, S : (x,y) \u2192 R. The structured output y often contains many interdependent variables, and the number of the possible structures can be exponentially large with respect to the size of x. At test time, the prediction y for x is obtained by\narg max y\u2208Gen(x) S(x,y),\nwhereGen(x) represents the set of all valid output structures for x.\nStandard learning algorithms often directly optimize the model parameters. For example, assume that the joint scoring function S is parameterized by \u03b8. Then, gradient descent algorithms can be used to optimize the model parameters \u03b8 iteratively. More specifically,\n\u03b8m = \u03b8m\u22121 \u2212 \u03b7m \u2202L(y\u2217, S(x,y; \u03b8))\n\u2202\u03b8m\u22121 , (1)\nwhere y\u2217 is the gold structure, L(y\u2217, S(x,y; \u03b8)) is a loss function and \u03b7m is the learning rate of the m-th iteration.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework called Structured Multiple Additive Regression Trees (S-MART), which generalizes Multiple Additive Regression Trees (MART) for structured learning problems. Different from Equation (1), SMART does not directly optimize the model parameters; instead, it approximates the optimal scoring function that minimize the loss by adding (weighted) regression tree models iteratively.\nDue to the fact that there are exponentially many input-output pairs in the training data, S-MART assumes that the joint scoring function can be decomposed as\nS(x,y) = \u2211\nk\u2208\u2126(x)\nF (x,yk),\nwhere \u2126(x) contains the set of the all factors for input x and yk is the sub-structure of y that corresponds to the k-th factor in \u2126(x). For instance, in the task of word alignment, each factor can be defined as a pair of words from source and target languages respectively. Note that we can recover y from the union of {yk}K1 .\nThe factor scoring function F (x,yk) can be optimized by performing gradient descent in the function space in the following manner:\nFm(x,yk) = Fm\u22121(x,yk)\u2212 \u03b7mgm(x,yk) (2)\nwhere function gm(x,yk) is the functional gradient.\nNote that gm is a function rather than a vector. Therefore, modeling gm theoretically requires an infinite number of data points. We can address this difficulty by approximating gm with a finite number of point-wise functional gradients\ngm(x,yk = uk) = (3)[ \u2202L(y\u2217, S(x,yk = uk))\n\u2202F (x,yk = uk)\n] F (x,yk)=Fm\u22121(x,yk)\nwhere uk index a valid sub-structure for the k-th factor of x.\nThe key point of S-MART is that it approximates \u2212gm by modeling the point-wise negative functional gradients using a regression tree hm. Then the factor scoring function can be obtained by\nF (x,yk) = M\u2211 m=1 \u03b7mhm(x,yk),\nAlgorithm 1 S-MART: A family of structured learning algorithms with multiple additive regression trees 1: F0(x,yk) = 0 2: for m = 1 to M do: . going over all trees 3: D \u2190 \u2205 4: for all examples do: . going over all examples 5: for yk \u2208 \u2126(x) do: . going over all factors 6: For all uk, obtain gku by Equation (3) 7: D \u2190 D \u222a {(\u03a6(x,yk = uk),\u2212gku)} 8: end for 9: end for 10: hm(x,yk)\u2190 TrainRegressionTree(D) 11: Fm(x,yk) = Fm\u22121(x,yk) + hm(x,yk) 12: end for\nwhere hm(x,yk) is also called a basis function and \u03b7m can be simply set to 1 (Murphy, 2012).\nThe detailed S-MART algorithm is presented in Algorithm 1. The factor scoring functionF (x,yk) is simply initialized to zero at first (line 1). After this, we iteratively update the function by adding regression trees. Note that the scoring function is shared by all the factors. Specifically, given the current decision function Fm\u22121, we can consider line 3 to line 9 a process of generating the pseudo training data D for modeling the regression tree. For each training example, S-MART first computes the point-wise functional gradients according to Equation (3) (line 6). Here we use gku as the abbreviation for gm(x,yk = uk). In line 7, for each sub-structure uk, we create a new training example for the regression problem by the feature vector \u03a6(x,yk = uk) and the negative gradient\u2212gku. In line 10, a regression tree is constructed by minimizing differences between the prediction values and the point-wise negative gradients. Then a new basis function (modeled by a regression tree) will be added into the overall F (line 11).\nIt is crucial to note that S-MART is a family of algorithms rather than a single algorithm. S-MART is flexible in the choice of the loss functions. For example, we can use either logistic loss or hinge loss, which means that SMART can train probabilistic models as well as non-probabilistic ones. Depending on the choice of factors, S-MART can handle various structures such as linear chains, trees, and even the semiMarkov chain (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004).\nS-MART versus MART There are two key differences between S-MART and MART. First, S-MART decomposes the joint scoring function S(x,y) into factors to address the problem of the exploding number of input-output pairs for struc-\ntured learning problems. Second, S-MART models a single scoring function F (x,yk) over inputs and output variables directly rather than O different functions F o(x), each of which corresponds to a label class.\nS-MART versus TreeCRF TreeCRF can be viewed as a special case of S-MART, and there are two points where S-MART improves upon TreeCRF. First, the model designed in (Dietterich et al., 2004) is tailored for sequence tagging problems. Similar to MART, for a tagging task with O tags, they choose to model O functions F o(x, o\u2032) instead of directly modeling the joint score of the factor. This imposes limitations on the feature functions, and TreeCRF is consequently unsuitable for many tasks such as entity linking.1Second, S-MART is more general in terms of the objective functions and applicable structures. In the next section, we will see how S-MART can be applied to a non-linear-chain structure and various loss functions."}, {"heading": "3 S-MART for Tweet Entity Linking", "text": "We first formally define the task of tweet entity linking. As input, we are given a tweet, an entity database (e.g., Wikipedia where each article is an entity), and a lexicon2 which maps a surface form into a set of entity candidates. For each incoming tweet, all n-grams of this tweet will be used to find matches in the lexicon, and each match will form a mention candidate. As output, we map every mention candidate (e.g., \u201cnew york giants\u201d) in the message to an entity (e.g., NEW YORK GIANTS) or to Nil (i.e., a non-entity). A mention candidate can often potentially link to multiple entities, which we call possible entity assignments.\nThis task is a structured learning problem, as the final entity assignments of a tweet should not overlap with each other.3 We decompose this learning problem as follows: we make each mention candidate a factor, and the score of the entity assignments of a tweet is the sum of the score of each entity and mention candidate pair. Although all mention candidates are decomposed, the non-\n1For example, entity linking systems need to model the similarity between an entity and the document. The TreeCRF formulation does not support such features.\n2We use the standard techniques to construct the lexicon from anchor texts, redirect pages and other information resources.\n3We follow the common practice and do not allow embedded entities.\noverlapping constraint requires the system to perform global inference.\nConsider the example tweet in Figure 1, where we show the tweet with the mention candidates in brackets. To link the mention candidate \u201cnew york giants\u201d to a non-Nil entity, the system has to link previous overlapping mention candidates to Nil. It is important to note that this is not a linear chain problem because of the non-overlapping constraint, and the inference algorithm needs to be carefully designed."}, {"heading": "3.1 Applying S-MART", "text": "We derive specific model for tweet entity linking task with S-MART and use logistic loss as our running example. The hinge loss version of the model can be derived in a similar way.\nNote that the tweet and the mention candidates are given. Let x be the tweet, uk be the entity assignment of the k-th mention candidate. We use function F (x, yk = uk) to model the score of the k-th mention candidate choosing entity uk.4 The overall scoring function can be decomposed as follows:\nS(x,y = {uk}Kk=1) = K\u2211 k=1 F (x, yk = uk)\nS-MART utilizes regression trees to model the scoring function F (x, yk = uk), which requires point-wise functional gradient for each entity of every mention candidate. Let\u2019s first write down the logistic loss function as\nL(y\u2217, S(x,y)) =\u2212 logP (y\u2217|x) = logZ(x)\u2212 S(x,y\u2217)\n4Note that each mention candidate has different own entity sets.\nwhere Z(x) = \u2211\ny exp(S(x,y)) is the potential function.

Hence, we propose a carefully designed forward-backward algorithm to calculate P (yk = uk|x) based on current scoring function F (x, yk = uk) given by the regression trees. The non-overlapping constraint distinguishes our inference algorithm from other forward-backward variants.\nTo compute the forward probability, we sort5 the mention candidates by their end indices and define forward recursion by\n\u03b1(u1, 1) = exp(F (x, y1 = u1))\n\u03b1(uk, k) = exp(F (x, yk = uk))\n\u00b7 P\u22121\u220f p=1 exp(F (x, yk\u2212p = Nil))\n\u00b7 \u2211 uk\u2212P \u03b1(uk\u2212P , k \u2212 P ) (4)\nwhere k \u2212 P is the index of the previous nonoverlapping mention candidate.

Specifically, in the first stage, the system identifies all possible entities with basic features, which enables the extraction of entity-entity features. In the second stage, we re-train S-MART on a union of basic features and entity-entity features. We define entity-entity features based on the Jaccard distance introduced by Guo et al.

For both evaluation settings, precision, recall and F1 scores are reported. Our data is constructed from two publicly available sources: Named Entity Extraction & Linking (NEEL) Challenge (Cano et al., 2014) datasets,\nand the datasets released by Fang and Chang (2014). Note that we gather two datasets from Fang and Chang (2014) and they are used in two different evaluation settings. We refer to these two datasets as TACL-IE and TACL-IR, respectively. We perform some data cleaning and unification on these sets. The statistics of the datasets are presented in Table 1.7\nIE-driven evaluation The IE-driven evaluation is the standard evaluation for an end-to-end entity linking system. We follow Carmel et al. (2014) and relax the definition of the correct mention boundaries, as they are often ambiguous. A mention boundary is considered to be correct if it overlaps (instead of being the same) with the gold mention boundary. Please see (Carmel et al., 2014) for more details on the procedure of calculating the precision, recall and F1 score.\nThe NEEL and TACL-IE datasets have different annotation guidelines and different choices of knowledge bases, so we perform the following procedure to clean the data and unify the annotations. We first filter out the annotations that link to entities excluded by our knowledge base. We use the same knowledge base as the ERD 2014 competition (Carmel et al., 2014), which includes the union of entities in Wikipedia and Freebase. Second, we follow NEEL annotation guideline and re-annotate TACL-IE dataset. For instance, in order to be consistent with NEEL, all the user tags (e.g. @BarackObama) are re-labeled as entities in TACL-IE.\nWe train all the models with NEEL Train dataset and evaluate different systems on NEEL Test and TACL-IE datasets. In addition, we sample 800 tweets from NEEL Train dataset as our development set to perform parameter tuning.\nIR-driven evaluation The IR-driven evaluation is proposed by Fang and Chang (2014). It is motivated by a key application of entity linking \u2014 retrieval of relevant tweets for target entities, which is crucial for downstream applications such as product research and sentiment analysis. In particular, given a query entity we can search for tweets based on the match with some potential sur-\n7The datasets can be downloaded from http:// research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/ 24c267d7-4c19-41e8-8de1-2c116fcbdbd3/ default.aspx.

The statistics of the full datasets and the corresponding results are available in Appendix A.\nface forms of the query entity. Then, an entity linking system is evaluated by its ability to correctly identify the presence or absence of the query entity in every tweet. Our IR-driven evaluation is based on the TACL-IR set, which includes 980 tweets sampled for ten query entities of five entity types (roughly 100 tweets per entity). About 37% of the sampled tweets did not mention the query entity due to the anchor ambiguity."}, {"heading": "4.2 Experimental Settings", "text": "Features We employ a total number of 37 dense features as our basic feature set. Most of the features are adopted from (Guo et al., 2013)8, including various statistical features such as the probability of the surface to be used as anchor text in Wikipedia. We also add additional Entity Type features correspond to the following entity types: Character, Event, Product and Brand. Finally, we include several NER features to indicate each mention candidate belongs to one the following NER types: Twitter user, Twitter hashtag, Person, Location, Organization, Product, Event and Date.\nAlgorithms Table 2 summarizes all the algorithms that are compared in our experiments. First, we consider two linear structured learning algorithms: Structured Perceptron (Collins, 2002) and Linear Structured SVM (SSVM) (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004).\nFor non-linear models, we consider polynomial SSVM, which employs polynomial kernel inside the structured SVM algorithm. We also include LambdaRank (Burges et al., 2007), a neuralbased learning to rank algorithm, which is widely used in the information retrieval literature. We further compare with MART, which is designed for performing multiclass classification using log loss without considering the structured information. Finally, we have our proposed log-loss SMART algorithm, as described in Section 3. 9\nNote that our baseline systems are quite strong.\n8We consider features of Base, Capitalization Rate, Popularity, Context Capitalization and Entity Type categories.\n9Our pilot experiments show that the log-loss SMART consistently outperforms the hinge-loss S-MART.\nLinear SSVM has been used in one of the stateof-the-art tweet entity linking systems (Guo et al., 2013), and the system based on MART is the winning system of the 2014 NEEL Challenge (Cano and others, 2014)10.\nTable 2 summarizes several properties of the algorithms. For example, most algorithms are structured (e.g. they perform dynamic programming at test time) except for MART and LambdaRank, which treat mention candidates independently.\nParameter tuning All the hyper-parameters are tuned on the development set. Then, we re-train our models on full training data (including the dev set) with the best parameters. We choose the soft margin parameter C from {0.5, 1, 5, 10} for two structured SVM methods. After a preliminary parameter search, we fixed the number of trees to 300 and the minimum number of documents in a leaf to 30 for all tree-based models. For LambdaRank, we use a two layer feed forward network. We select the number of hidden units from {10, 20, 30, 40} and learning rate from {0.1, 0.01, 0.001}.\nIt is widely known that F1 score can be affected by the trade-off between precision and recall. In order to make the comparisons between all algorithms fairer in terms of F1 score, we include a post-processing step to balance precision and recall for all the systems. Note the tuning is only conducted for the purpose of robust evaluation. In particular, we adopt a simple tuning strategy that works well for all the algorithms, in which we add a bias term b to the scoring function value of Nil:\nF (x, yk = Nil)\u2190 F (x, yk = Nil) + b.\nWe choose the bias term b from values between \u22123.0 to 3.0 on the dev set and apply the same bias term at test time.\n10Note that the numbers we reported here are different from the results in NEEL challenge due to the fact that we have cleaned the datasets and the evaluation metrics are slightly different in this paper."}, {"heading": "4.3 Results", "text": "Table 3 presents the empirical findings for SMART and competitive methods on tweet entity linking task in both IE and IR settings. In the following, we analyze the empirical results in details.\nLinear models vs. non-linear models Table 3 clearly shows that linear models perform worse than non-linear models when they are restricted to the IE setting of the tweet entity linking task. The story is similar in IR-driven evaluation, with the exception of LambdaRank. Among the linear models, linear SSVM demonstrates its superiority over Structured Perceptron on all datasets, which aligns with the results of (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005) on the named entity recognition task.\nWe have many interesting observations on the non-linear models side. First, by adopting a polynomial kernel, the non-linear SSVM further improves the entity linking performances on the NEEL datasets and TACL-IR dataset. Second, LambdaRank, a neural network based model, achieves better results than linear models in IEdriven evaluation, but the results in IR-driven evaluation are worse than all the other methods. We believe the reason for this dismal performance is that the neural-based method tends to overfit the IR setting given the small number of training examples. Third, both MART and S-MART significantly outperform alternative linear and non-linear methods in IE-driven evaluation and performs better or similar to other methods in IR-driven evaluation. This suggests that tree-based non-linear models are suitable for tweet entity linking task. Finally, S-MART outperforms previous state-of-\nthe-art method Structured SVM by a surprisingly large margin. In the NEEL Test dataset, the difference is more than 10% F1. Overall, the results show that the shallow linear models are not expressive enough to capture the complex patterns in the data, which are represented by a few dense features.\nStructured learning models To showcase structured learning technique is crucial for entity linking with non-linear models, we compare S-MART against MART directly. As shown in Table 3, S-MART can achieve higher precision and recall points compared to MART on all datasets in terms of IE-driven evaluation, and can improve F1 by 4 points on NEEL Test and TACL-IR datasets. The task of entity linking is to produce non-overlapping entity assignments that match the gold mentions. By adopting structured learning technique, S-MART is able to automatically take into account the non-overlapping constraint during learning and inference, and produce global optimal entity assignments for mention candidates of a tweet. One effect is that S-MART can easily eliminate some common errors caused by popular entities (e.g. new york in Figure 1).\nModeling entity-entity relationships Entityentity relationships provide strong clues for entity disambiguation. In this paper, we use the simple two-stage approach described in Section 3.3 to capture the relationships between entities. As shown in Table 3, the significant improvement in IR-driven evaluation indicates the importance of incorporating entity-entity information.\nInterestingly, while IR-driven results are significantly improved, IE-driven results are similar or even worse given entity-entity features. We believe the reason is that IE-driven and IR-driven evaluations focus on different aspects of tweet en-\ntity linking task. As Guo et al. (2013) shows that most mentions in tweets should be linked to the most popular entities, IE setting actually pays more attention on mention detection sub-problem. In contrast to IE setting, IR setting focuses on entity disambiguation, since we only need to decide whether the tweet is relevant to the query entity. Therefore, we believe that both evaluation policies are needed for tweet entity linking.\nBalance Precision and Recall Figure 2 shows the results of tuning the bias term for balancing precision and recall on the dev set. The results show that S-MART outperforms competitive approaches without any tuning, with similar margins to the results after tuning. Balancing precision and recall improves F1 scores for all the systems, which suggests that the simple tuning method performs quite well. Finally, we have an interesting observation that different methods have various scales of model scores."}, {"heading": "5 Related Work", "text": "Linear structured learning methods have been proposed and widely used in the literature.

Due to the raise of social media, many techniques have been proposed or tailored to short texts including tweets, for the problem of entity linking (Ferragina and Scaiella, 2010; Meij et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2013) as well as the related problem of named entity recognition (NER) (Ritter et al., 2011). Recently, non-textual information such as spatial and temporal signals have also been used to improve entity linking systems (Fang and Chang, 2014). The task of entity linking has attracted a lot of attention, and many shared tasks have been hosted to promote entity linking research (Ji et al., 2010; Ji and Grishman, 2011; Cano and others, 2014; Carmel et al., 2014).\nBuilding an end-to-end entity linking system involves in solving two interrelated sub-problems: mention detection and entity disambiguation. Earlier research on entity linking has been largely focused on the entity disambiguation problem, including most work on entity linking for wellwritten documents such as news and encyclopedia articles (Cucerzan, 2007) and also few for tweets (Liu et al., 2013). Recently, people have focused on building systems that consider mention detection and entity disambiguation jointly. For example, Cucerzan (2012) delays the mention detection decision and consider the mention detection and entity linking problem jointly. Similarly, Sil and Yates (2013) proposed to use a reranking approach to obtain overall better results on mention detection and entity disambiguation.\n11Chen et al. (2015) independently propose a class of treebased structured learning models using a similar formalization of S-MART. However, they focus on exploring secondorder information of line chain structures, while we aim at handling different structures and objective functions."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "In this paper, we propose S-MART, a family of structured learning algorithms which is flexible on the choices of the loss functions and structures. We demonstrate the power of S-MART by applying it to tweet entity linking, and it significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art entity linking systems. In the future, we would like to investigate the advantages and disadvantages between treebased models and other non-linear models such as deep neural networks or recurrent neural networks.\nAcknowledgments We thank the reviewers for their insightful feedback. We also thank Yin Li and Ana Smith for their valuable comments on earlier version of this paper."}, {"heading": "A Appendix: Results of Full Datasets", "text": "The statistics of the full NEEL and TACL-IE datasets are shown in Table 4. Table 5 presents the IE-driven evaluation results on the datasets. On the NEEL Test dataset, non-linear models significantly outperform linear models, tree-based models perform much better than alternative methods, and our treebased structured prediction method S-MART achieves the best results. The tree-based non-structured model MART yields best performance on the TACL-IE dataset with basic features, which slightly wins over S-MART by 0.5% F1. The entity-entity relationships improve the performance of S-MART on the TACL-IE dataset by 3.6 points of F1."}], "references": [{"title": "Predicting the future with social media", "author": ["Asur", "Huberman2010] S.
