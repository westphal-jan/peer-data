INTRODUCTION", "text": "It\u2019s an essential problem in social computing to recognize the\nnature of the social interrelationships between individuals. The model of interrelationship is fundamental to many related studies such as community discovery, influence analysis, link predication and recommendation [2]. There are two primary options to\ndetermine the nature of an interrelationship: The first one is to model the interrelationship from an objective view which supposes the properties of interrelationships can be investigated independently of the subjective opinions of participant individuals.\nThe second option supposes the properties of interrelationships are subjective which should be determined by investigating each individual\u2019s opinion on their interrelationships respectively. The interrelationship model based on these two strategies can be quite\ndifferent. For an interrelationship, the objective principle often assign a single value to each property, which is symmetric to both sides of the interrelationship. While the subjective principle naturally leads to an asymmetric measurement of interrelationship\u2019\nproperties because the two individuals may have different opinions on their interrelationship from their own side.\nThe subjective asymmetric model of interrelationship is more informative and sensitive than the objective relationship model. To perform asymmetric measurement of interrelationship\u2019s properties, we need some features which can reflect the subjective\nopinions of individuals. Researches on signed social networks suggest to predicate the properties\u2019 value for each individual according to the network they are embedded in. Linguistic analysis suggests another path forward to leverage textual features\nto predict individual\u2019s opinion.\nIntuitively, to describe the individuals\u2019 opinions on their interrelationship, the features of their interactive language should be more capable than the features of their social relationships.\nHowever, the structural features of their social relationship may still be a latent cause which influence their asymmetric opinions on interrelationship, and can also be helpful to understand and measure individuals\u2019 asymmetric opinions indirectly.\nIn this work, we investigate the relationship between individuals\u2019 opinions on their interrelationship and their structural characteristics in social network. To do this, we try to investigate the correlation between the typical language features of interactive\nlanguage and the typical structural features of social network."}, {"heading": "1.1 Language and Network Features in Social Network Analysis", "text": "Along with the springing up of more and more researches on the natural language processing and the signed social networks, researchers try to combine these two technologies to investigate\nthe nature of the social relationship in recent studies.\nThrough measuring the ability of the feature sets of social behavioral and textual information to determine the different types of relationships, Adal\u0131 et al. [1] drew the conclusion that these two\nkind of information were practically equivalent between pairs of individuals\u2019 interaction in social media. Approach of Pang and Lee [10] extended the model of text corpus-based statistical learning approach proposed by Bramsen et al.

However, current studies do not explore the intrinsic causes of the opinions\u2019 asymmetry on\ninterrelationships sufficiently, and does not make full use of the topology information from the social network to explain the opinions on the interrelationships. In this paper, we focus on the factors that cause individuals\u2019 asymmetric opinions on\ninterrelationships.\nIf individuals\u2019 opinions only depend on their own subjective ideas, then we can only measure their opinions with subjective features e.g., the features of interactive language. Intuitively, an\nindividual\u2019s opinion on one of his social relationships is not only determined by his own ideas, but also affected by other relationships or individuals related to him in the social network. Therefore, in this paper, we try to put a single interrelationship\ninto social network context in order to investigate the correlation between the individuals\u2019 opinions and social network features. As in [14], opinions will be characterized by the features of interactive language. This investigation will tell us whether the\nsocial network characteristics are intrinsic causes of individuals\u2019 opinions on their interrelationship, and shall we introduce topology features into the subjective model of social relationship.\nIn section 2, we introduce how to characterize the asymmetric\nopinions on interrelationship with interactive language features.

CHARACTERIZE ASYMMETRIC OPINIONS ON INTERRELATIONSHIP", "text": "WITH INTERACTIVE LANGUAGE\nFEATURES In current studies, most of the researches aim at investigating the strength or type (e.g., positive & negative) of the social relationship between two individuals from an objective view by measuring the objective features, e.g., the frequency of the\ncommunication between participants and the embeddedness of interrelationship. On this basis, some researches utilize the directed objective features, e.g., the bidirectional communication frequency between two participants. However, it\u2019s still difficult to\ndescribe subjective opinions accurately using directed objective features only. Therefore, it\u2019s a new trend to combine subjective and objective features to model social relationships, especially from subjective view.\nAlong with the researches on subjective features, researchers find\nthat interactive language is a good choice to obtain subjective features of interrelationship, because the interactive language not\nonly related to the properties of interrelationship closely, but also is very capable to describe individuals\u2019 opinions. In this section, we\u2019ll compare the objective and subjective features of the\ninterrelationship and then utilize several typical subjective features of interactive language to measure the asymmetric opinions on interrelationship following the method in [14]."}, {"heading": "2.1 Objective Features of Interrelationship", "text": "The most widely used objective feature of social relationship is the topology features of social network. Among social network\nfeatures, the embeddedness of interrelationships and the communication frequency between the participants are two most popular objective features to measure social relationships.\nThe embeddedness is a feature which can measure the strength of an interrelationship with the coincidence degree of two\nindividuals\u2019 interrelationships, i.e., the count of the common \u2018friends\u2019 of the two participants. Embeddedness has been proved to be an effective objective feature which describes the strength of interrelationships, but it is not designed to be directed.\nThe frequency of certain type of communication between the two participants are also used to represent the strength of an\ninterrelationship in many studies. The frequency of phone calls, emails and mutual comments on social media are all widely used frequency features. Exactly speaking, communication frequency is not an absolute objective feature, because it is a behavior of the\nparticipants which is a subjective decision in a sense. The communication frequency can naturally be measured directionally, e.g., we can measure the bidirectional strength of an interrelationship with bidirectional communication frequency. But,\nthe communication frequency cannot measure subjective opinions directly with very limited information. For example, in some cases, though we have similar email frequency with two colleagues, we may have different attitudes towards the interrelationships with the two colleagues respectively.\nThe subjective features e.g., linguistic features of interactive language can be used to recognize the participants\u2019 opinions on their interrelationship more directly. For the same example, though we have similar email frequency with two colleagues, our\ndifferent attitudes on two interrelationships still can be revealed by the content of the emails."}, {"heading": "2.2 Sociolinguistics and Subjective Features", "text": "The subjective feature can reveal the participants\u2019 opinions on their interrelationship. Based on it, the theory of communicative action [6] in sociolinguistics proposed to reconstruct the concept\nof relationship with the communicative action instead of the objectivistic information. Thus we can utilize the linguistic structures of communication to understand the social relationships more normatively. Sapir-Whorf hypothesis [11] also supposed\nthat the semantic structure of the language use shapes the ways in which a speaker forms conceptions of the world including social relationships. Individuals\u2019 choices of the words in communication were highly related to their opinions on their interrelationship.\nTherefore we can investigate the asymmetric opinions on social relationships with the interactive language used.\nHow can we describe an individual\u2019s interactive language style in order to describe his opinion on his interrelationship? In sociolinguistics, Holmes [8] proposed four important dimensions to study the language used in social communication:\n1. The solidarity-social distance scale: concentrate on the solidarity of the relationships in social communication.\n2. The social status scale: concentrate on the relative status of the individuals in social relationship.\n3. The formality scale: concentrate on the formality of language that individuals use in different places, topics and relationships.\n4. The referential and affective scale: concentrate on referential\nand affective function of the language that individuals use in social communication.\nAmong these four dimensions, the first two mainly concern about the features of social interrelationship from both subjective and objective views. The last two aim at the features of interactive languages, which are highly related to the social interrelationship.\nInspired by Holmes\u2019 theory, in this work, we use four typical\nfeatures of interactive language to investigate individuals\u2019 opinion on their interrelationships, including frequency, length, fluency and sentiment polarity which indicate quantity, quality and emotion of the interactive language, respectively:\n1. The frequency is the number of times of communications\nwithin a specified period of time, which can partially reflect one\u2019s intentions of the communication on an interrelationship.\n2. The length is the number of the words of the interactive language , which is related to one\u2019s emphasis degree on an interrelationship.\n3. The fluency is a widely used feature in natural language processing which can reflect the formality and quality of\ninteractive language. We can speculate whether an individual treats an interrelationship seriously or not with the quality of his language in communication.\n4. The sentiment polarity can indicate the emotion tendency of the interactive language, which tends to have a positive correlation with the personal evaluation on an interrelationship intuitively."}, {"heading": "2.3 Distinguish the Opinions and Language Habits in Interactive Language Style", "text": "Though the features of interactive language are closely related to\nindividuals\u2019 opinions on the ir interrelationship, it is still difficult to understand the opinions accurately with the original value of language features, because in natural language understanding, the true meaning of a sentence is always determined by not only the sentence itself, but also the context.\nThe context of interactive language is so complex including the occasion of the dialogue, speaker\u2019s habit of language use, the sentences in the same discourse and so on. In this work, we focus on the individual\u2019s language habit and its influence on the\nunderstanding of his interactive language. The meaning of a speaker\u2019s language is intuitively related to his language habit. For example, suppose A is a negative people who talks to every people very negatively. We also know that A talks to another person B\nwith negative sentiment polarity score, but A talks to B most friendly compared with the others. In this case, if we want to measure A\u2019s opinion on his relationship with B correctly with sentiment polarity score, we need to avoid the interference from\nA\u2019s language habit and use the relative score normalized by A\u2019s personal language habit instead of using the original score directly.\nIn this work, for an individual I, to characterize I\u2019s opinion more accurately and avoid the interference from I\u2019s language habit, we normalize I\u2019s each language feature f with I\u2019s language habit value\nHf(I).

A typical\nstructural feature of single interrelationship is embeddedness. The embeddedness is the number of common vertexes connected with the two end points of one edge. It means the number of common friends of two persons engaged in an interrelationship. Embeddedness is believed to be a good indicator of the strength of\nsocial relationship. In this work, we suppose that embeddedness is also related to the degree of opinions\u2019 asymmetry on an\ninterrelationship. This assumption is based on the similar idea of the strength measurement of social relationship: it is widely believed that more common friends indicate make two persons\nconnected to each other more tightly. In this work, we suppose that more common friends can also make two persons\u2019 opinions on their interrelationship more symmetric.

The triadic closure consists of any three vertexes and edges between them, i.e., any three persons and the interrelationship between them. In traditional balance theory, each social relationship is\nsinged with binary tag \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018-\u2019, which indicate positive or negative relationship. With binary signs, there are four different signs combination for a triadic closure. The balance theory claims that two of them are balanced and the other two are unbalanced,\nas shown in Figure 1. The balanced triadic closures are stable while the unbalanced ones tend to change to be balanced.\ntriangles,while the other two are unbalanced. Actually, the traditional balance theory can be explained with the concept of homogeneity. In a triadic closure, the more consistent of the two individuals\u2019 views on the third one, the more positive their opinions on their interrelationship is, and vice versa."}, {"heading": "3.3.2 Our extension of the balance theory", "text": "The homogeneity based explanation in previous section extend the traditional balance theory from binary s igns to continuous value. Furthermore, this explanation can also extend the traditional balance theory from undirected relationship to directed\nrelaitonship, because it describes the balance with individual\u2019s opinion instead of the objective type. This extension makes it possible to investigate the correlation between triangle balance and opinions\u2019 asymmetry on interrelationship. In this section, we\nintroduce the details of this extension of traditional balance theory.\nFirst of all, let\u2019s analyze the essential idea of the traditional balance theory. The idea is: the polarity of an interrelationship is related to the homogeneity (common friends) of the two\nparticipants. To be exact, the homogeneity here indicates the consistency of the views about the third party (person or thing). With this assumption, the traditional balance theory can only predict the binary polarity of an interrelationship between two\npersons A and B with the binary polarity of their interrelationship with a third person C. It\u2019s obvious that in traditional balance theory, we cannot determine the balance of a triadic closure with the individuals\u2019 directed opinions instead of the undirected binary\nsigns on interrelationships.\nTo solve this problem, we extend the traditional balance theory to a directed version keeping the essential principle of homogeneity. In the extension, an individual A\u2019s opinion on his interrelationship\nwith another individual B, is presented as a continuous value on a directed edge (A, B).When we want to investigate the bidirectional opinions\u2019 asymmetry between A and B, we build an extended triadic closure with four directed edges include (A, B), (B, A), (A,\nC) and (B, C) as shown in Figure 2. Instead of the binary sign, we label each directed edge with a real-value in [0, 1] to indicate the opinion of the individual on the start point, e.g., |AB| indicates the value of A\u2019s opinion on his relationship with B.\nIn this extended triadic closure, we measure the balance of the triadic closure comparing two differences: when the difference between |AC| and |BC| is smaller than a threshold, we recognize the sign of the opinions\u2019 difference on the third party as \u2018-\u2019, which\nmeans A and B has similar opinions on their interrelationships with C. Otherwise we recognize the sign of the opinions\u2019 difference on the third party as \u2018+\u2019, which means A and B have different opinions on their interrelationships with C.\nIn the same way, when the difference between |AB| and |BA| is smaller than the same threshold, we recognize the sign of the opinions\u2019 difference on interrelationship as \u2018-\u2019 which means A and B have similar opinions on the ir interrelationship. Otherwise we\nrecognize the sign of the opinions\u2019 difference on interrelationship as \u2018+\u2019 which means A and B have different opinions on the ir interrelationship. The threshold here is the average of all bidirectional differences on every interrelationship in the given\nsocial network. If the opinions\u2019 difference on the third party and the opinions\u2019 difference on interrelationship has the same sign, we identify the directed triadic closure as balanced, otherwise, it is unbalanced."}, {"heading": "4.

In the experiment of vertexes\u2019 degree, the asymmetry degree of \u2018length\u2019 and \u2018sentiment\u2019 score relatively have higher negative correlation with the degree of vertexes, and the other two features have no significant correlation. This\nindicates that a more sociable person, i.e., a person with more friends, may be more active to cater to the partners\u2019 opinions in social interrelationships, i.e., have less asymmetry degree on interrelationships, especially reflected on the intension (length)\nand sentiment tendency (sentiment score).\nThough \u2018length\u2019 and \u2018sentiment\u2019 score also have relative higher correlation in the experiment of clustering coefficient, the absolute values are too small, therefore we don\u2019t think that there is\ncorrelation between the clustering coefficient and the average asymmetry degree of vertexes on any language feature in this case.\nFurthermore, the correlation of frequency is the lowest. One possible explanation is that the send/replay relationships between\nthe emails can always lead to similar bidirectional email sending frequency between two individuals. This bidirectional correlation is independent with the opinions or social structure of the individuals.\nIn general, in this set of experiments, we find that the degree (number of friends) of the individuals in social network may have latent influence on the individuals\u2019 opinions and language behaviors on their each interrelationships."}, {"heading": "4.4 Edge Factors vs. Language Features", "text": "In the next experiment, we investigate the correlation between the structural features of single interrelationship in social network and\nthe opinions\u2019 asymmetry on the interrelationship, which is also measured by language features.\nWe calculated the Pearson Correlation Coefficient between the\nembeddedness of edges and the asymmetry degree between edges\u2019 two end points on each language feature.

This indicates that if two individuals have more common friends, the asymmetry\nof their opinions on their interrelationship is weaker, i.e., they have more similar opinions on their interrelationship.\nThis result can also be an important extension to the traditional triadic closure theory of social relationship. The traditional triadic\nclosure theory states that the strength of a social interrelationship has a positive correlation with the number of common friends. For any two individuals, our results extend the theory to the positive correlation among the number of their common friends, the\nstrength of their interrelationship and the symmetry of their opinions on their interrelationship."}, {"heading": "4.5 Balance Theory vs. Language Features", "text": ""}, {"heading": "4.5.1 The verification of traditional balance theory", "text": "In the last set of experiments, we firstly verified the balance assumption in traditional balance theory introduced in section\n3.3.1 on Enron email data. The balance assumption in tradition balance theory is that in any social network, the signed triadic closures tend to be balanced in general. Since the traditional balance theory is based on undirected edge, we merge every two\nbidirectional edge pairs between two vertexes into a new undirected edge whose opinion value is the sum of two opinion values on bidirectional edges. Then we set a tunable threshold. The merged undirected edge whose opinion value is bigger than\nthe threshold was labeled \u2018+\u2019, otherwise was labeled \u2018-\u2019.\nIn a given social network, in order to verify the traditional balance assumption, we should firstly determine a random baseline for the triadic closures distribution. In other word, in a social network,\ngiven a prior proportion of the positive (signed by '+\u2019) edges noted as p+, and the proportion of negative (signed by '-\u2019) edges noted as 1- p+, the random baseline for the triadic closures distribution is the proportion of balanced triadic closures when all the positive\nand negative edges are randomly distributed. Assuming that the\nproportion of the positive edges labeled \u2018+\u2019 is p+ (0\u2264p+\u22641). According to the traditional balance theory in traduced in section\n3.3.31, we can calculate the proportion of balanced triadic closures Pbalance_traditional in random distribution using Formula (9), where \ud835\udc5d+ 3 is the probability of balanced tringles labeled \u2018+++\u2019, and 3\ud835\udc5d(1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5d+) 2 is the probability of balanced tringles labeled \u2018+--\u2019, \u2018-+-\u2019, and \u2018--+\u2019\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52_\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 = \ud835\udc5d+ 3 + 3\ud835\udc5d(1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5d+) 2 (9)\nIn Figure 6, we illustrate the proportion of balanced triangles with\ndifferent proportion of positive edges. In the experiments, we change the proportion of positive edges by tuning the threshold of \u2018+/-\u2019 labeling. In Figure 6, the abscissa is the proportion of positive edges, the ordinate is the proportion of balanced triangles.\nThe red curve is the baseline of random distribution. The other four curve are results on four language features, respectively.\nIn Figure 6, we have two observations. First, we can intuitively find that the balanced triangles proportion and the proportion of\npositive edges are positively correlated. This is consistent with the fact that in traditional balance theory, two balanced tringles have more positive edges than two unbalanced triangles. Second, we can find that the proportions of balanced triangles on all four\nfeatures increase faster than the random baseline with the increase of positive edges proportion. When the positive edges proportion\nis bigger than 0.5, the proportions of balanced triangles is greater than random baseline on all features.\nFrom a dynamic point of view, the observations indicate that\nwhen more interrelationship turn to be positive in a social network, the social interrelationship triangles will turn to be balanced at a faster rate. From a static point of view, the balanced triangles may not always have advantages than unbalanced triangles. Its\nadvantage is more significant in the social network where positive relationship accounted for the majority."}, {"heading": "4.5.2 The verification of extended balance theory", "text": "Based on the extension of traditional balance theory in section\n3.3.2\uff0c in this experiment, we investigate whether the balance assumption is still correct in the extended balance theory.\nIn the extended balance theory, a triadic closure is balanced when\nthe opinions\u2019 difference on the third party and the opinions\u2019 difference on the interrelationship has the same sign. Given a threshold, we turn the above two differences into \u2018+/-\u2019 signs. The difference greater than the threshold is signed \u2018+\u2019, and vice versa.\nWe suppose the proportion of positive difference (signed by \u2018+\u2019) is p\u2019+. In extended balance theory the tringles with \u2018++\u2019 and \u2018--\u2019 signs are balanced. Therefore, we calculate the proportion of balanced triadic closures Pbalance_extended in random distribution using Formula (10).\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52_\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 = \ud835\udc5d+ 2 + (1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5d+) 2 (10)\nAs in section 4.5.1, we can adjust the proportion of interrelationship with positive difference (i.e., difference bigger than threshold) with different threshold values. Then, we can investigate whether the balance assumption is still correct by\ninvestigating whether the balanced tringles are still dominant in extended balance theory.\nThe result curves are shown in Figure 7. The abscissa is the proportion of interrelationship pairs having positive differences,\nthe ordinate is the proportion of balanced triadic closures. There are five curves in the diagram among which the red one represents the random baseline according to Formula (7), the red curve is the baseline of random distribution. The other four curve are results\non four language features, respectively.\nIn Figure 7, we have two observations. First, we can find that when the proportion of the positive difference interrelationship pairs is around 0.5, the proportion of balanced triadic closures\nreaches the lowest point. The reason for this phenomenon is that when the proportion of positive difference pairs is equal to that of\nnegative difference pairs, there is the maximum probability to form triadic closures with \u2018+-\u2019 signs which is unbalanced.\nSecond, we also find that the proportion of the balanced triadic\nclosure is higher than the random baseline with the increase of the proportion of negative difference relation pairs (move to the left side on X-axis). This result gives a new interpretation to the balance theory based on the asymmetric opinions measurement.\nThe homogeneity assumption of the traditional balance theory is that in a social triadic closure, the more the two individuals\u2019 opinions on the common friends is consistent, the more positive the interrelationship between them is, and vice versa. Based on the\nresults of this experiment, we can extend this assumption. The new assumption can be stated as: in a social triadic closure, the more the two individuals\u2019 opinions on the common friends is consistent (more negative difference on third party) , the more\nsimilar the two participants\u2019 opinions on their interrelationship are, i.e., less asymmetric on bidirectional opinions (more negative difference on interrelationship)."}, {"heading": "4.6 Visualization of Enron Social Network", "text": "In addition, in Figure 8 and 9, we further provide a visualization\nof the asymmetric opinions and balanced triangles in a part of Enron email social network. Each node is an email user and the edge pair between two nodes are their directed interrelationships. The size of a node indicates the degree of the node. The thickness\nof the edges illustrates the language feature value on each direction of interrelationships. Therefore, the asymmetry of the opinions can be illustrated by the difference of the two edges\u2019 thickness between each nodes pair. Furthermore, the balanced\ntriangles is colored red in both figures. Figure 8 and 9 shows the colored results by traditional balance theory and extended balance theory, respectively.\nThe social network visualization in Figure 8 and 9 support our\nabove conclusions in an intuitive way. First, it can be seen that the bidirectional feature values, i.e., the bidirectional opinions on interrelationships are more symmetric and balanced in a dense community, where an individual\u2019s tend to have more friends and\ntwo individuals tend to have more common friends. This observation support the conclusions in section 4.3 and 4.4.

CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this work, we investigated whether the structural context features in online social network are latent factors of individuals\u2019\nasymmetric opinions on their interrelationship. We characterize individuals\u2019 bidirectional opinions on interrelationships with their interactive language features following the existing method. As a case study, on Enron email dataset, we analyzed the correlations\nbetween multiple structural context features and the degree of opinions\u2019 asymmetry. The investigated structural features includes the degree and clustering coefficient of vertexes, the embeddedness of the edges and the balance of the triadic closures.\nDuring the investigation, an extension is also made to traditional balance theory to meet the form of asymmetric opinions.\nWith the investigation on Enron email, we find that in this case, some of the structural context features in social network can be\nlatent factors influence the individuals\u2019 asymmetric opinions on their interrelationship. First, a more sociable person, i.e., a person with more friends, tend to be more active to cater to the partners\u2019 opinions in social interrelationships. Second, two individuals\nsharing more common friends tend to have more similar opinions on their interrelationship, which can be an extension of the traditional theory of social triadic closure. Third, in a social triadic closure, the two individuals\u2019 having more similar opinions on\ntheir relationship with the third person also tend to have more similar opinions on their interrelationship, which can be an extension of the traditional social balance theory. Fourth, by extending the traditional balance theory to directed social triangle,\nwe show that directed social triangle also tend to be balanced in Enron email dataset.\nThese results reveal that the subjective features on a social interrelationship is not only related to individuals\u2019 own opinions\nbut also related to their structural context in social network. This work also encourage us to further study the interaction between the topology and content in social network, and measure the social relationship synthetizing the objective and subjective features in\nfuture work."}, {"heading": "6.
