These postulates identify desirable properties for the conclusions drawn from an argument based reasoning process, and focus on the effects of non-defeasible rules within an argumentation system. However, these postulates provide no desiderata with regards to the conclusions drawn from the defeasible rules found within an argumentation system. This latter type of rule is critical to argumentation, and identifying postulates for such rules is therefore important. At the same time, a large body of work exists which deals with non-monotonic reasoning (NMR). Such NMR systems (exemplified by approaches such as circumscription [11], default logic [16] and auto-epistemic logic [14]) introduce various approaches to handling defeasible reasoning, and axioms have been proposed to categorise such systems [9].\nIn this paper we seek to combine the rich existing body of work on NMR with structured argumentation systems. We aim to identify what axioms structured argument systems, exemplified by ASPIC+[12] meet1. In doing so, we also wish to investigate the links between NMR axioms and the rationality postulates. Doing so may, in the future, allow us to identify additional postulates which apply to the defeasible portion of structured argumentation systems.\n1ASPIC+ was selected for this study due to its popularity, and its ability to model a variety of other structured systems [13].\n2 ASPIC+ Argumentation Framework\nASPIC+ [12] is a widely used formalism for structured argumentation, which satisfies the rationality postulates of [3]. Arguments within ASPIC+ are constructed by chaining two types of inference rules, beginning with elements of a knowledge base. The first type of inference rule is referred to as a strict rule, and represents rules whose conclusion can unconditionally be drawn from a set of premises. This is in contrast to defeasible inference rules, which allow for a conclusion to be drawn from a set of premises as long as no exceptions or contrary conclusions exist.\nDefinition 1 An argumentation system is a triple AS = \u3008L,R, n\u3009 where:\n\u2022 L is a logical language closed under negation2 \u00b7\u0304.\n\u2022 R = Rs \u222aRd is a set of strict (Rs ) and defeasible (Rd ) inference rules of the form \u03c61, . . . , \u03c6n \u2192 \u03c6 and \u03c61, . . . , \u03c6n \u21d2 \u03c6 respectively (where \u03c6i , \u03c6 are meta-variables ranging over wff in L), and Rs \u2229Rd = \u2205.\n\u2022 n : Rd 7\u2192 L is a naming convention for defeasible rules.\nWe write \u03c61, . . . , \u03c6n \u03c6 if R contains a rule of the form \u03c61, . . . , \u03c6n \u2192 \u03c6 or \u03c61, . . . , \u03c6n \u21d2 \u03c6.\nDefinition 2 A knowledge base in an argumentation system \u3008L,R, n\u3009 is a set K \u2286 L consisting of two disjoint subsets Kn (the axioms) and Kp (the ordinary premises).\nAn argumentation theory consists of an argumentation system and knowledge base.\nDefinition 3 An argumentation theory AT is a pair \u3008AS ,K\u3009, where AS is an argumentation system AS and K is a knowledge base.\nAn argumentation theory is strict iff Rd = \u2205 and Kp = \u2205, and is defeasible iff it is not strict. To ensure that reasoning meets norms for rational reasoning according to the rationality postulates of [3], an ASPIC+ argumentation system must be such that its strict rules are closed under transposition. That is, given a strict rule with premises \u03d5 = {\u03c61, . . . , \u03c6n} and conclusion \u03c6 (written \u03d5 \u2192 \u03c6), a set of n additional rules of the following form must be present in the system: {\u03c6} \u222a \u03d5\\{\u03c6i} \u2192 \u03c6i for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n .\nArguments are defined recursively in terms of sub-arguments and through the use of several functions: Prem(A) returns all the premises of argument A; Conc(A) returns A\u2019s conclusion, and TopRule(A) returns the last rule used within the argument. Sub(A) returns all of A\u2019s sub-arguments. Given this, arguments are defined as follows.\nDefinition 4 An argument A on the basis of an argumentation theory AT = \u3008\u3008L,R, n\u3009,K\u3009 is:\n1. \u03c6 if \u03c6 \u2208 K with: Prem(A) = {\u03c6}; Conc(A) = {\u03c6}; Sub(A) = {A}; TopRule(A) = undefined.\n2. A1, . . . ,An \u2192 / \u21d2 \u03c6 if Ai are arguments such that there respectively exists a strict/defeasible rule Conc(A1), . . . , Conc(An) \u2192 / \u21d2 \u03c6 in Rs / Rd . Prem(A) = Prem(A1) \u222a . . . \u222a Prem(An); Conc(A) = \u03c6; Sub(A) = Sub(A1) \u222a . . . \u222a Sub(An) \u222a {A}; TopRule(A) = Conc(A1), . . . , Conc(An) \u2192 / \u21d2 \u03c6.\nWe write A(AT ) to denote the set of arguments on the basis of the theory AT , and given a set of arguments A, we write Concs(A) to denote the conclusions of those arguments, that is:\nConcs(A) = {Conc(A)|A \u2208 A}\nLike other argumentation systems, ASPIC+ utilises conflict between arguments \u2014 represented through attacks \u2014 to determine what conclusions are justified.\nAn argument can be attacked in three ways: on its ordinary premises, on its conclusion, or on its inference rules. These three kinds of attack are called undermining, rebutting and undercutting attacks, respectively.\n2This is a small deviation from the standard presentation of ASPIC+, which makes use of a contrariness function which need not be symmetrical.\nDefinition 5 An argument A attacks an argument B iff A undermines, rebuts or undercuts B , where:\n\u2022 A undermines B (on B \u2032) iff Conc(A) = \u03c6 for some B \u2032 = \u03c6 \u2208 Prem(B) and \u03c6 \u2208 Kp .\n\u2022 A rebuts B (on B \u2032) iff Conc(A) = \u03c6 for some B \u2032 \u2208 Sub(B) of the form B \u2032\u20321 , . . . ,B \u2032\u2032 2 \u21d2 \u03c6.\n\u2022 A undercuts B (on B \u2032) iff Conc(A) = n(r) for some B \u2032 \u2208 Sub(B) such that TopRule(B) is a defeasible rule r of the form \u03c61, . . . , \u03c6n \u21d2 \u03c6.\nNote that, in ASPIC+ rebutting is restricted. That is an argument with a strict TopRule can rebut an argument with a defeasible TopRule, but not vice versa. ([4] and [10] introduce the ASPIC- and ASPIC+D systems which use unrestricted rebut). Finally, A set of arguments is said to be consistent iff there is no attack between any arguments in the set.\nAttacks can be distinguished by whether they are preference-dependent (rebutting and undermining) or preference-independent (undercutting). The former succeed only when the attacker is preferred. The latter succeed whether or not the attacker is preferred. Within ASPIC+ preferences over defeasible rules and ordinary premises are combined or lifted to obtain a preference ordering over arguments [12]. Here, we are not concerned about the means of combination, but, following [12], we only consider reasonable orderings. For our purposes, a reasonable ordering is one such that adding a strict rule or axiom to an argument will neither increase nor decrease its preference level.\nDefinition 6 A preference ordering is a binary relation over arguments, i.e., \u2286 A\u00d7A, where A is the set of all arguments constructed from the knowledge base in an argumentation system.\nCombining these elements results in the following:\nDefinition 7 A structured argumentation framework is a triple \u3008A, att , \u3009, where A is the set of all arguments constructed from the argumentation system, att is the attack relation, and is a preference ordering on A.\nPreferences over arguments interact with attacks such that preference-dependent attacks succeed when the attacking argument is preferred. In contrast preference-independent attacks always succeed. Attacks that succeed are called defeats. Using Definition 4 and the notion of defeat, we can instantiate an abstract argumentation framework from a structured argumentation framework.\nDefinition 8 An (abstract) argumentation framework AF corresponding to a structured argumentation framework SAF = \u3008A, att , \u3009 is a pair \u3008A,Defeats\u3009 such that Defeats is the defeat relation on A determined by SAF .\nThis abstract argumentation framework can be evaluated using standard argumentation semantics [5], defining the notion of an extension:\nDefinition 9 Let AF = \u3008A,Defeats\u3009 be an abstract argumentation framework, Let A \u2208 A and E \u2286 A. E is said to be conflict-free iff there do not exist a B ,C \u2208 E such that B defeats C . E is said to defend A iff for every B \u2208 A such that B defeats A, there exists a C \u2208 E such that C defeats B . The characteristic function F : 2A \u2192 2A is defined as F (E ) = {A \u2208 A|E defends A}. E is called (1) an admissible set iff E is conflict-free and E \u2286 F (E ); (2) a complete extension iff E is conflict-free and E = F (E ); (3) a grounded extension iff E is the minimal complete extension; and (4) a preferred extension iff E is a maximal complete extension, where minimality and maximality are w.r.t. set inclusion.\nWe note in passing that other extensions have been defined and refer the reader to [1] for further details.\nDefinition 10 If AF = \u3008A,Defeats\u3009 is an abstract argumentation framework, and E is the extension under one of Dung\u2019s semantics. We write Just(A) to denote the set of justified conclusions of the set of arguments A, i.e., Just(A) = {Concs(E )}.\n3 Axiomatic Reasoning and ASPIC+\nKraus et al. [9], building on earlier work by Gabbay [6], identified a set of axioms which characterise nonmonotonic inference in logical systems, and studied the relationships between sets of these axioms. Their goal was to characterise different kinds of reasoning; to pin down what it means for a logical system to be monotonic or non-monotonic; and \u2014 in particular \u2014 to be able distinguish between the two. Table 1 presents the axioms of [9], which we will use to characterise reasoning in ASPIC+. The symbol |\u223c encodes a consequence relation, while |= identifies the statements obtainable from the underlying theory. Note that we have altered some of the symbols used in [9] to avoid confusion with the notation of ASPIC+. Equivalence is denoted \u2261 (rather than \u2194), and \u2192\u0592 (rather than \u2192) denotes the existence of a rule, acknowledging the fact that a rule may be strict or defeasible.\nConsequence relations that satisfy Ref, LLE, RW, Cut and CM are said to be cumulative, and [9] describes them as being the weakest interesting logical system. Cumulative consequence relations which also satisfy CP are monotonic, while consequence relations that are cumulative and satisfy M are called cumulative monotonic. Such relations are stronger than cumulative but not monotonic in the usual sense.\nTo determine which axioms ASPIC+does or does not comply with, we must decide how different aspects of the axioms should be interpreted. We interpret the consequence relation |\u223c in a couple of ways that are natural in the context of ASPIC+\u2014 describing these in detail later \u2014 and which fit with the high level meaning of \u201cif \u03b1 is in the knowledge base, then \u03b2 is a conclusion\u201d, or \u201c\u03b2 is a consequence of \u03b1\u201d.\nAssuming such an interpretation of \u03b1 |\u223c \u03b2 we can consider the meaning of the axioms. Some axioms are clear. For example, axiom T says that if \u03b2 is a consequence of \u03b1, and \u03b3 is a consequence of \u03b2, then \u03b3 is a consequence of \u03b1. Other axioms are more ambiguous. Does \u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2 |\u223c \u03b3 in Cut mean that \u03b3 is a consequence of the conjunction \u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2 or is it a consequence of \u03b1 and \u03b2 together? In other words is \u2227 a feature of the language underlying the reasoning system, or a feature of the meta-language in which the properties are written? Similarly, given the distinction between strict and defeasible rules, is \u03b1 \u2192\u0592 \u03b2 a strict rule in ASPIC+, a defeasible rule, or some statement in the property meta-language?\nThe symbols found in the axioms are interpreted as follows.\n\u2022 |= \u03b1 means that \u03b1 is an element of the relevant argumentation theory AT .\n\u2022 \u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2 means both \u03b1 and \u03b2, in particular in Cut and CM, it means that both \u03b1 and \u03b2 are in the knowledge base.\n\u2022 \u03b1 \u2261 \u03b2 is taken \u2014 as usual \u2014 to abbreviate the formula (\u03b1 \u2192\u0592 \u03b2) \u2227 (\u03b2 \u2192\u0592 \u03b1). We assume \u03b1 \u2192\u0592 \u03b2 and \u03b2 \u2192\u0592 \u03b1 have the same interpretation, i.e., both or neither are strict.\n\u2022 \u03b1 \u2192\u0592 \u03b2 has two interpretations. We have the strict interpretation in which \u03b1 \u2192\u0592 \u03b2 denotes a strict rule \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2 in ASPIC+, and the defeasible interpretation in which \u03b1 \u2192\u0592 \u03b2 denotes either a strict or defeasible rule. We denote the latter interpretation by writing \u03b1 \u03b2.\n4 Axioms and Consequences in ASPIC+\nWe now consider the two different interpretations of the non-monotonic consequence relation |\u223c described above, identifying which axioms each interpretation satisfies. In the following, we assume an arbitrary ASPIC+ argumentation theory AT = \u3008\u3008L,R, n\u3009,K\u3009, and write ATx for an extension of this augmentation theory also containing proposition x : ATx = \u3008\u3008L,R, n\u3009,K \u222a {x}\u3009. An argument present in the latter, but not former, theory is denoted Ax ."}, {"heading": "4.1 Argument Construction", "text": "We begin by considering the consequence relation as representing argument construction. I.e., we interpret \u03b1 |\u223c \u03b2 as meaning that if \u03b1 is in the axioms or ordinary premises of a theory, we can construct an argument for \u03b2. More precisely:\nDefinition 11 We write \u03b1 |\u223ca \u03b2, if for every ASPIC + argumentation theory AT = \u3008\u3008L,R, n\u3009,K\u3009 such that \u03b2 6\u2208 Concs(A(AT )), it is the case that \u03b2 \u2208 Concs(A(AT\u03b1)).\nProposition 1 The consequence relation |\u223ca is cumulative for both strict and defeasible theories.\nProof Consider an arbitrary theory AT = \u3008\u3008L,R, n\u3009,K\u3009.

Since \u03b1 |\u223cj \u03b3, we know that there is an extension E\u03b1 containing A\u03b11 ,A \u03b1 2 , . . . ,A \u03b1 n with A \u03b1 1 = [\u03b1] and Conc(A \u03b1 n) = \u03b3. Furthermore, there is no attack 3 between Ai (i = 1 . . .n) and B\u03b1, where B\u03b1 is an argument in E\u03b1. In addition, there is no argument with conclusion \u03b2 in E\u03b1 since A\u03b11 is in E\u03b1 and there is a strict rule \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2 4. Now consider theory AT\u03b2 , which has\n3Note that since |\u223cj considers any preference ordering, attacks and defeats here are equivalent. 4Due to closure under strict rules.\na chain of arguments A\u03b20 = [\u03b2],A \u03b2 1 = [A \u03b2 0 \u2192 \u03b1],A \u03b2 2 , . . . ,A \u03b2 n , where Conc(A \u03b2 n) = \u03b3. There is an extension E\u03b2 = {A \u03b2 0 , . . . ,A \u03b2 n} \u222a (E\u03b1 \u2212 {A \u03b1 1 , . . . ,A \u03b1 n}) in AT\u03b2 under the same semantic. Therefore strict LLE holds for |\u223cj . [RW (strict version)] Consider the extension E\u03b3 in AT\u03b3 containing an argument A \u03b3 with Conc(A\u03b3) = \u03b1. Since |= \u03b1 \u03b2, under the strict interpretation, we know that \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2 is in AT\u03b3 . Because of closure under strict rules, B\u03b3 = [A\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b2] is in E\u03b3 . Therefore the strict version of RW holds for |\u223cj . [Cut] Since \u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2 |\u223cj \u03b3, we know that there is an extension E\u03b1,\u03b2 of AT\u03b1,\u03b2 containing B\u03b1,\u03b2 ,A \u03b1,\u03b2 1 , . . . ,A \u03b1,\u03b2 n with A \u03b1,\u03b2 1 = [\u03b1], B\n\u03b1,\u03b2 = [\u03b2] and Conc(A\u03b1,\u03b2n ) = \u03b3. Now consider the theory AT\u03b1. Since \u03b1 |\u223cj \u03b2, there is an extension E\u03b1 containing B\u03b11 ,B \u03b1 2 . . . ,B \u03b1 m with B \u03b1 1 = [\u03b1] and Conc(B \u03b1 m ) = \u03b2. The set E\u03b1 \u222a (E\u03b1,\u03b2 \u2212 {B\n\u03b1,\u03b2}) is an extension in AT\u03b1 (c.f., LLE above). Therefore cut holds for |\u223cj . [CM] Since \u03b1 |\u223cj \u03b2, AT\u03b1 and AT\u03b1,\u03b2 contain similar arguments. Since \u03b1 |\u223cj \u03b3, there is an extension E\u03b1 in AT\u03b1 containing A \u03b1 1 , . . . ,A \u03b1 n with A \u03b1 1 = [\u03b1] and Conc(A \u03b1 n) = \u03b3. E\u03b1 is also an extension in AT\u03b1,\u03b2 , since AT\u03b1 and AT\u03b1,\u03b2 contain similar arguments. Therefore CM holds for |\u223cj .\nProposition 7 The consequence relation |\u223cj does not satisfy M, T or CP for defeasible theories.\nProof We will give counter-examples. [M] Consider the ASPIC+ theory that includes Kn = {a} and R = {a \u2192 b; b \u2192 a; b \u21d2 \u03b3}. Thus, b |\u223cj \u03b3, however, a 6|\u223cj \u03b3. Therefore, M does not hold for |\u223cj . [T] Consider the ASPIC+ theory which includes K = \u2205 and R = {a \u21d2 b; b \u21d2 c; c \u21d2 r ; a \u2192 c}. Thus, a |\u223cj b and b |\u223cj r , but a 6|\u223cj r . Therefore, T does not hold for |\u223cj . [CP] Since contraposition does not hold for |\u223ca , by Proposition 3 it cannot hold for |\u223cj .\nIf we consider only strict theories, the following holds.\nProposition 8 The consequence relation |\u223cj satisfies Ref, M and T for strict theories.\nProof If the theory is strict, for any argumentation theory, all conclusions are justified. Therefore, for any strict theory, if \u03b1 |\u223ca \u03b2, then \u03b1 |\u223cj \u03b2. We know that |\u223ca holds for Ref, M and T, therefore, |\u223cj holds for Ref, M and T in a strict theory.\nThus |\u223cj is cumulative monotonic for strict theories."}, {"heading": "4.3 Discussion", "text": "The results from the previous sections are summarized in Table 2. What light does the above shine on ASPIC+ and argumentation-based reasoning in general? Considering |\u223ca , it is no surprise that the relation is cumulative monotonic and satisfies the axiom M which captures a form of monotonicity. It is clear from the detail of ASPIC+, and indeed any argumentation system, that the number of arguments grows over time. However, the fact that |\u223ca is not monotonic in the same strict sense as classical logic, and so is strictly weaker, as a result of not satisfying CP, is a bit more interesting. This is, of course, because arguments are not subject to the law of the excluded middle \u2014 it is perfectly possible for there to be arguments for \u03b1 and \u03b1 from the same theory.\nTurning to |\u223cj , this is perhaps a more reasonable notion of consequence for ASPIC + than |\u223ca . If \u03b1 |\u223cj \u03b2, then there is an argument for \u03b2 which holds despite any attacks (in the scenario we have considered, where all\nattacks may be defeats for some preference ordering \u2014 and therefore succeed \u2014 there can still be attacks on the argument for \u03b2, but the attacking arguments must themselves be defeated). This is quite a restrictive notion of consequence in a representation that allows for conflicting information, and as Table 2 makes clear, |\u223cj is a relatively weak notion of consequence. It obeys less of the axioms and thus sanctions less conclusions than the non-monotonic logics analysed in [9], for example. For defeasible theories |\u223cj is not cumulative, and only satisfies LLE and RW if the rules applied in those axioms are strict. As we pointed out above, at the time that [9] was published, cumulativity was considered the minimum requirement of a useful logic5. Whether or not one accepts this, it is clear that ASPIC+ is weak. But is it too weak? To answer this, we should consider the cause of the weakness, which as Table 2 shows is due to LLE, RW and Ref.\nLLE and RW only hold if the axioms are only applied to strict rules. In both cases, the effect of the axiom is to extend an existing argument, either switching one premise for another (LLE), or adding a rule to the conclusion of an argument (RW). While having these axioms hold for defeasible rules would allow |\u223cj to be cumulative for defeasible theories, it is not reasonable for justified conclusions to be drawn under these circumstances \u2014 using LLE or RW to extend arguments with defeasible rules by definition means that the new arguments can be defeated. Thus their conclusions may not be justified.\nA similar argument applies to Ref. Proposition 8 tells us that Ref holds for |\u223cj for strict theories. In effect that means that \u03b1 has to be an axiom. If Ref were to hold for defeasible theories, \u03b1 could be a premise. But premises can be defeated, again by definition, so it is not appropriate to directly conclude that any premise is a justified conclusion (it is necessary to go through the whole process of constructing arguments and establishing extensions to determine this).\nFrom this we conclude that though |\u223cj is not cumulative, and hence ASPIC + is, in some sense, weaker than non-monotonic logics like circumscription [11] and default logic [16], it is not clear that it is too weak. That is strengthening |\u223cj so that it is cumulative for defeasible theories would allow conclusions that make no sense from the point of view of argumentation-based reasoning. Whether there are other ways to strengthen ASPIC+ that do make sense is an open question, and one we will investigate."}, {"heading": "5 The Rationality Postulates", "text": "Finally, we consider the three postulates of [3] (which ASPIC+ complies with), namely (1) closure under strict rules; and (2) direct and (3) indirect consistency. We ask whether the axioms discussed in this paper are equivalent to any of these postulates. In what follows, we assume that strict rules are consistent."}, {"heading": "5.1 Closure under strict rules", "text": "Proposition 9 An argumentation framework meets closure under strict rules if and only if the consequence relation for strict rules complies with right weakening (RW) with regards to justified conclusions.\nProof Given an argumentation framework AF , assume that \u03b1 is in the justified conclusions. Therefore \u22a4 |\u223cj \u03b1, and assume that there is a strict rule |= \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2. Using RW, we obtain \u22a4 |\u223cj \u03b2. Therefore RW implies closure under strict rules. Furthermore, as per the proof of Proposition 6, closure under strict rules implies that |\u223cj satisfies RW."}, {"heading": "5.2 Direct consistency", "text": "Direct consistency with regards to |\u223cj requires that no extension contains inconsistent arguments (and therefore inconsistent conclusions).

Subsequent discovery of logics of causality that are not cumulative suggests that this view should be revised."}, {"heading": "5.3 Indirect Consistency", "text": "Proposition 10 Assume we have direct consistency, and that strict rules are consistent. Any system which satisfies monotonicity under strict rules will satisfy indirect consistency, and vice-versa.\nProof From [3, Prop. 7], direct consistency and closure yield indirect consistency. We assume direct consistency, and monotonicity gives closure.\nIn this section we have shown that the rationality postulates described in [3] can be described using axioms from classical logic and non-monotonic reasoning. In future work, we intend to determine whether these axioms can help identify additional rationality postulates. In addition, we will investigate whether these axioms can represent the additional rationality postulates described in [17]."}, {"heading": "6 Related Work", "text": "There are several papers describing work that is similar in some respects to what we report here. Billington [2] describes Defeasible Logic, a logic that, as its name implies, differs from classical logic in that it deals with defeasible reasoning. In addition to introducing the logic, [2] shows that defeasible logic satisfies the axioms of reflexivity, cut and cautious monotonicity suggested in [6], thus satisfying what [6] describes as the basic requirements for a non-monotonic system (such a system is equivalent to a cumulative system in [9]). [8] subsequently established significant links between reasoning in defeasible logic and argumentationbased reasoning. To do this, [8] provides an argumentation system that makes use of defeasible logic as its underlying logic, and shows that the system is compatible with Dung\u2019s semantics [5]. Given Defeasible Logic\u2019s close relation to Prolog [15], this line of work is closely related to Defeasible Logic Programming (DeLP) [7], a formalism combining results of Logic Programming and Defeasible Argumentation. As a rule-based argumentation system, DeLP also has strict/defeasible rules and a set of facts. DeLP differs from ASPIC+ in the types of attack relation it permits (no undermining) and in the way that it computes conclusions (it does not implement Dung\u2019s semantics)."}, {"heading": "7 Conclusions", "text": "In this paper we considered which of the axioms of [9] ASPIC+ meets based on two different interpretations of the consequence relation. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that when strict and defeasible elements are both present, ASPIC+ is not cumulative, and even in the presence of only strict rules, is not monotonic. These results suggest that additional constraints need to be placed on any instantiation of ASPIC+. Since ASPIC+ is intended as a template that can be instantiated with other logics (by the inclusion of strict rules that capture the rules of inference of those logics), this is perhaps unsurprising. However, it does place constraints on what those logics must bring if certain properties are required of that instantiation of ASPIC+. For example, rules that capture contraposition are required for the strict part of ASPIC+ to be monotonic in the sense of [9]. We also investigated the relationship between the axioms of [9] and the rationality postulates, and suggested an alternative, axiom based formulation of the latter.\nAs mentioned above, we will investigate whether additional axioms can encode the rationality postulates described in [17]. We will also examine the properties of different interpretations of the logical symbols. For example, we assumed that \u2261 encodes the presence of two rules, but says nothing about their preferences or defeaters. Finally, we may consider other interpretations of the consequence relation. This paper therefore opens up several significant avenues of future investigation."}], "references": [{"title": "An introduction to argumentation semantics", "author": ["P. Baroni", "M.

of argument based reasoning. In doing so, we consider two possible interpretations of the consequence relation, and describe which axioms are met by ASPIC under each of these interpretations. We then consider the links between these axioms and the rationality postulates. Our results indicate that argument based reasoning as characterised by ASPICis \u2014 according to the axioms of [9] \u2014 non-cumulative and non-monotonic, and therefore weaker than the weakest non-monotonic reasoning systems they considered possible. This weakness underpins ASPIC\u2019s success in modelling other reasoning systems, and we conclude by considering the relationship between ASPICand other weak logical systems.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
