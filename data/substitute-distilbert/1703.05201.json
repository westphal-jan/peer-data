This orderings may express preferences of individuals, groups or a society on a wide range of topics including various products, goods, meals, jobs, services, sportsmen, movies, leisure time activities, etc. In media, rankings of object often appear in a form of various TOP10, TOP100, etc. Ranking of object is also important in a search of a desired object. For a given set of keywords or key phrases, users can search for books, movies, songs or Internet pages. Many Internet stores provide rankings of their goods ordered with respect to price, the year of production, customer recommendations, etc. Rankings are useful when searching for information; the best-known Internet search engine is Google Page rank algorithm which ranks Internet pages according to their relevance for given keywords. Also, the study of rankings or orderings was found extremely important in bioinformatics or genomics.\nWhen considering rankings, one important problem deals with its similarity (dissimilarity), if the same set of objects is ranked by more than one decision maker. Usually, a suitable distance or metric function is employed to assess the similarity, see e.g. Diaconis and Graham (1977), Beck and Lin (1983), Kendall and Gibbons (1990), Cook and Kress (1991), Cook et al. (1996), Fagin et al. (2003), Cook (2006), Tavana et al. (2007), Carterette (2009), Mazurek (2011b) or Farnoud et al. (2014). Other approach takes advantage of some correlation coefficient, such as Kendall\u2019s correlation coefficient tau or Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient are used, see Spearman (1904) and Kendall (1962).\nAnother problem stems from the fact that sometimes an expert might hesitate about assigning an object a precise position in a ranking. For instance, a decision maker may say that an object X belongs among three best objects of its category. In such a case, a decision maker is unable to provide a precise ranking of objects, but might be able to provide a fuzzy ranking of objects, that is the ranking where one object can be assigned more than one position. This situation is quite common in a real world due to lack of information, insufficient knowledge of a decision maker, time pressure or conflicting evidence.\nTherefore, fuzzy rankings constitute a generalization of (crisp) rankings which might be useful in situations when precise ranking of objects is not possible, or is not suitable. The aim of this paper is to introduce a notion of the fuzzy ranking, and to discuss some of their\nproperties, namely similarity between two fuzzy rankings, ordering of objects and indecisiveness.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Section 1 crisp rankings are briefly described, section 2 introduces fuzzy rankings and sections 3-5 provide fuzzy rankings properties, section 6 includes numerical examples and conclusions close the article."}, {"heading": "1. Crisp rankings", "text": "In a crisp ranking each object is assigned its position, so that n objects are ranked from the 1st to the nth place. Thus, every ranking can be considered a permutation of objects. The permutation of a finite set A is defined as a bijection from A to itself: : A A\u03c0 \u2192 . Each permutation (each ranking) of n objects can be represented by a square binary matrix of order n with exactly one value of 1 in each row and column \u2013 a permutation matrix. For instance, the permutation (ranking) of three objects A, B and C such that A is 1st, C 2nd and B 3rd , \u03c0 = (A, C, B), can be represented by a matrix \u03c0 with rows corresponding to object and columns to positions:\n1 0 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 0 \u03c0    =      \nDistance-based evaluation of similarity of rankings is based on the premise that the more similar are two ranking, the smaller is their distance. On the other hand, rank correlation coefficients assess similarities (or dissimilarities) in the order of objects listed from the top to the bottom. The advantage of the latter approach rests in the fact that they are normalized to intervals [\u20131,1]. The higher are the values of a coefficient, the more similar are both rankings. Definition 1. (Kendall\u2019s rank correlation coefficient). Let A and B be two rankings on the same domain (on the same set of objects). Kendall\u2019s rank correlation coefficient tau is defined as follows (Abdi 2007, Kendall 1962):\n)1(\n)(2 \u2212 \u2212 = nn nn dc\u03c4 , (1)\nwhere nc is the number of concordant pairs and nd is the number of discordant pairs. Concordant (discordant) pair is the ordered pair of objects, which has the same (opposite) order in both rankings. Kendall\u2019s tau is normalized to interval [ ]1,1\u2212 . In the case of maximum similarity between two rankings 1=\u03c4 (rankings are identical). In the case of maximum dissimilarity 1\u2212=\u03c4 (one ranking is reverse of the other).\nHowever, as will be shown in Example 1, rank correlation coefficients alone (or distancebased measures of similarity) are not sufficient in capturing the similarity of rankings, and therefore are not suitable in practice. Example 1. Consider five objects A, B, C, D and E and their rankings R1, R2 and R3 shown in Figure 1. Rankings R1 and R2 differ only by one transposition, namely A and B, for the first and second position. Therefore, from (1) we get: 2(9 1) 16\n0.8 5(5 1) 20 \u03c4 \u2212= = = \u2212 .\nNow consider rankings R2 and R3. Again, only order of one pair of objects, D and E, is reversed, hence 0.8\u03c4 = once again. In terms of Kendall\u2019s tau, the similarity of both pairs is the same. However, in the former case the difference seems to be more important, as the first object (a winner) is different. The change at the 4th or 5th place, in the latter pair, is not so important. Therefore, to evaluate similarity of two rankings, Kendall\u2019s distance is not sufficient.\nTo solve the problem of different importance of a position in a ranking, cost or penalty functions were introduced, see e.g. Angelov et al. (2008), Kapah et al. (2009), Kumar and Vassilvistskii (2009) or Farnoud and Milenkovic (2012), Definition 2. Let n be the number of compared objects. Let ( )ijP p be n n\u00d7 symmetric real matrix with entries [ ]0,1ijp \u2208 , { }, 1,2,...,i j n\u2200 \u2208 , corresponding to interchange of i-th and j-th object in a ranking. Furthermore, ij kl ilp p p+ = , { }, , , 1,2,...,i j k l n\u2200 \u2208 . Then P is called a penalty matrix. Remark 1. In Definition 2 the constraint [ ]0,1ijp \u2208 is not necessary, but the normalization of penalty values might be more convenient. Example 2. Figure 2 provides an example of a penalty matrix. For example, the value\n12 0.5p = means that the transposition of the 1 st and 2nd object in a given ranking is penalized\nby the value 0.5.\n0 0.5 0.8 1\n0.5 0 0.3 0.5\n0.8 0.3 0 0.2\n1 0.5 0.2 0\nP      =      \nFig. 2. An example of a penalty matrix.\nDefinition 3. Let A be a finite set of objects and let Ri and Rj be rankings of all objects from A expressed in a matrix form. Then, the difference of the two rankings is a matrix given as:\nij i jD R R= \u2212 . (2) Definition 4. Let P be a penalty matrix and let Dij be a difference of rankings Ri and Rj given by relation (2). Then, the dissimilarity function DIS of Ri and Rj is given as:\n1 1\n1 ( , , )\n2\nn n\ni j ij ij i j DIS R R P p d = = = \u22c5\u2211\u2211 . (3)\nMaximal dissimilarity DISmax between two rankings Ri and Rj occurs when both rankings are in a reversed order. In such a case, we get:\nmax\n1 , ,\n2 ijj i DIS p i j > = \u2200\u2211 . (4)\nDefinition 5. The similarity SIM of two rankings Ri and Rj is given as follows:\n,\nmax\n( , ) 1 i ji j DIS\nSIM R R DIS = \u2212 . (5)\nRemark 2. From Definition 3 it is clear that [ ]0,1SIM \u2208 ."}, {"heading": "2. Fuzzy rankings", "text": "Fuzzy rankings are generalization of crisp rankings. In crisp rankings, each object was assigned one position, and matrix representation of a crisp ranking is a matrix with only one \u201c1\u201d in each row and column.\nHowever, in real-world decision making problems, a decision maker might be unsure about precise ranking of objects. Consider a situation when four objects, A, B, C and D are ranked so that C is 3rd and D is 4th, but a decision maker is not sure whether A is first or second when compared to B. Therefore, a DM can assign a value 0.5 to 1st position for A and 0.5 for 2nd position of A, which means a (precise) tie with B. In this case the matrix representation would be that shown in Figure 3a). If a DM is more inclined to A as the 1st object, he can assign for example the value 0.7 for A at the 1st position and 0.3 for 2nd position (which lefts B with 0.3 at 1st position and 0.7 at 2nd position), see Figure 3b).\nThis example leads to the notion of a fuzzy ranking. Given a set of n objects and the set of n positions these objects occupy in a ranking, each ordered pair (object, position) is assigned the value f (a membership degree) from [0,1] interval:\n( ) [ ]1,0,: \u2192positionobjectf . (6)\nThe value 1 means that a given object belongs to a given position in a given ranking with absolute certainty. On contrary, value 0 expresses that given object does not belong to a given position with absolute certainty.\nTo guarantee logical consistency (for instance one object cannot be ranked with absolute certainty to two or more different positions), some constraints of the values of the mapping (6) are necessary. This, in turn, leads to the definition of a fuzzy ranking:\nDefinition 6. The fuzzy ranking is every square matrix ( )ij n nR a \u00d7 satisfying the following\nconditions:\n1\n1 n\nij i a = =\u2211 and 1\n1 n\nij j a = =\u2211 . (7)\nAccording to Definition 6, every bistochastic matrix can be considered a fuzzy ranking, and vice versa. The set of permutation matrices Sn of order n is a subset of a set of bistochastic matrices (see Theorem 1 thereinafter). Relations (7) pose 2n \u2013 1 constraints for aij values, hence the number of degrees of freedom is (n \u2013 1)2. The set of bistochastic matrices is often denoted as Bn, where Bn stands for Birkhoff\u2019s polytopes of order n.\nTheorem 1 (Birkhoff-von Neumann). The set of bistochastic matrices of order n is the convex hull1 of the set of permutation matrices of order n.\nProof : Birkhoff (1948).\nWith respect to its algebraic structure, the set Sn is a group under matrix multiplication, while the set Bn is only a monoid.\nProposition 1. The set of bistochastic matrices (Bn) of order 2n \u2265 is a monoid under matrix multiplication.\nProof: To be a monoid, the set Bn has to be closed under matrix multiplication, it must satisfy associativity and a unitary element I must exist for all nA B\u2208 . Because matrix multiplication is associative and the identity matrix nI B\u2208 , it suffices to show that Bn is closed under multiplication: Let nA B\u2208 , nB B\u2208 andC A B= \u22c5 . Then the sum of all elements in the k-th row\nof the matrix C is: 1 1 1\n. 1 1 n n n\nkj ji kj j i j a b a = = =   = \u22c5 =    \u2211 \u2211 \u2211 , the proof for columns is analogous. As Bn\ncontains singular matrices as well, it is not a group.\nProposition 2. The arithmetic mean and the weighted arithmetic mean (with normalized weights) of fuzzy or crisp permutations is a fuzzy permutation. (The set of fuzzy rankings of a given order is closed under arithmetic mean operation).\nProof : obvious from Definition 6.\nProposition 2 states that from an algebraic point of view the set of fuzzy rankings of a given order endowed with the arithmetic mean as a binary operation is only a magma (a grupoid). However, for practical purposes Proposition 2 ensures closeness: It guarantees the arithmetic mean of fuzzy rankings is a fuzzy ranking again.\n1The convex hull H(X) of a set X (Birkhoff,1948): ( )\n1 1\n/ , , 0, 1, 1,2,... n n\ni i i i i i i i H X a a X R n\u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 = =  = \u2208 \u2208 \u2265 = =    \u2211 \u2211 ."}, {"heading": "3. Fuzzy rankings and ordering of objects", "text": "In the case of crisp rankings, the ranking of all objects is obvious. However, in the case of fuzzy rankings the situation is more complex. To rank all objects of a given fuzzy ranking, the following pair-wise dominance relation is introduced (Mazurek 2011a, 2012): Definition 7. Let ij\u03a0 be the fuzzy ranking of an object i at a position j. Then, a cumulative fuzzy ranking Hij of an object i from the 1 st to the jth position is given as:\n1\nj\nij ik k H = = \u03a0\u2211 . (8)\nDefinition 8. An object r dominates an object s ( )r s\u227b if and only if all cumulative fuzzy rankings Hrj of an object r are higher (at least once) or equal to cumulative fuzzy rankings Hsj of an object s:\n( )r s\u227b \u21d4 rj sjH H\u2265 , { }1, 2,...,j n\u2208 . (9) The highest ranking (the best) object is the object which is not dominated by any other object. It should be noted that the dominance relations given in (8) and (9) enable only a partial order of all objects, as some object might be incomparable (tied)."}, {"heading": "4. Fuzzy rankings and similarity", "text": "Similarity between two fuzzy rankings iR and jR can be defined analogously to the similarity of crisp rankings via relations (2-5).

Fuzzy rankings and indecisiveness", "text": "Fuzzy rankings framework allows an evaluation of experts\u2019 decisions in terms of indecisiveness. An expert is absolutely decisive, when he assigns each alternative value 1 for a given position and value 0 to all other positions, and indecisive otherwise. To evaluate indecisiveness, Shannon\u2019s entropy as a measure of uncertainty can be used, see e.g. Klir and Folger (1987):\n2 1\n( ( )) ( ) log ( ( )) n\ni i i H p x p x p x = = \u2212\u2211 .

Numerical examples", "text": "In this section several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the use of fuzzy rankings. Example 3. Consider the fuzzy ranking of 4 objects (A, B, C and D) shown in Figure 4 and order all objects.\nFirstly, from relation (8) the cumulative fuzzy rankings Hij of all objects are computed, see Figure 5. Notice from Figure 5, that A is ranked better (higher) than B for the 1st position; A is ranked better than B for the 1st and 2nd position altogether; both objects are equal for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd position altogether, and of course, A and B are equal for all positions altogether. Therefore, with the use of relation (9), A dominates B ( BA \u227b ). After the evaluation of all pairs, the following overall ranking of all four alternatives is as follows: 1st A, 2nd B, 3rd C and 4th D.\nExample 4. Consider two fuzzy rankings 1R and 2R shown in Figures 6 and 7, and the penalty matrix in Figure 2. Then the dissimilarity of both rankings given by relation (3\u00b4) is:\n1 2\n1 1\n1 ( , , )\n2\nn n\nij ij i j DIS R R P p d = = = \u22c5\u2211\u2211 = 0.275\n1,2 1 2\nmax\n( , ) 1 DIS\nSIM R R DIS = \u2212 = 0.2751 0.880 2.3 \u2212 = .\nAs for indecisiveness, index of indecisiveness for 1R : II( 1R ) = 0.801, and II( 2R ) = 0.871.\nTherefore, 1R is less indecisive and provides more specific information than 2R .\nFuzzy ranking can be also employed in a group decision making framework, where each expert (a decision maker) provides a crisp ranking of (the same set) of given objects. Then, an aggregation of these crisp rankings leads to a fuzzy ranking (see Theorem 1). For aggregation functions and operators see e.g. Grabisch et al. (2009). The same applies to a multiple criteria decision making framework, where crisp rankings of objects with respect to a given set of criteria can be aggregated into one fuzzy ranking. Example 5. Consider 4 decision makers and their crisp rankings of four objects (A, B, C and D) given in Figure 9. Then, with the use of the arithmetic mean as the aggregation operator the fuzzy ranking of the group is achieved, see Fig. 10. At last, all four objects can be ranked with the use of dominance relations (8) and (9): First we compare A and B (see Figure 11): A is ranked equally with B for the 1st position; A is ranked better than B for the 1st and 2nd position altogether; A is ranked equally with B for the 1st , 2nd and 3rd position altogether, which means A dominates B. By evaluation of all other pairs of objects we get the final (group) ranking of all objects: 1st A, 2nd B, 3rd C and 4th D."}, {"heading": "7.

However, due to lack of knowledge, information of time pressure, decision makers might not be able to provide a (crisp) ranking of objects from the top to the bottom. Instead, some objects might be ranked equally, or better than other objects only to some degree. In such cases, a generalization of crisp rankings to fuzzy rankings can be more useful. The aim of the article is to introduce the notion of a fuzzy ranking and to discuss its several properties, namely orderings, similarity and indecisiveness. The proposed approach can be used both for group decision making or multiple criteria decision making when uncertainty is involved.", "creator": "PDFCreator 2.3.0.103"}}}
