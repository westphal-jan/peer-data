A f -divergence is defined for a strictly convex function f with f(1) = 0 by:\nIf (p : q) = d\u2211 i=0 \u03bbipf ( \u03bbiq \u03bbip ) .\nIt is a separable divergence since the d-variate divergence can be written as a sum of d univariate divergences: If (p : q) = \u2211d i=0 If (\u03bb i p : \u03bb i q). The class of f -divergences plays an essential role in information theory since they are provably the only separable divergences that satisfy the information monotonicity property [2, 35]. That is, by coarse-graining the histograms we obtain lower-dimensional multinomials, say p\u2032 and q\u2032, such that 0 \u2264 If (p\u2032 : q\u2032) \u2264 If (p : q), see [2]. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence \u03c1IG is a f -divergence obtained for f(u) = \u2212 log u:\n\u03c1IG(p, q) = d\u2211 i=0 \u03bbip log \u03bbip \u03bbiq . (2)\nIt is an asymmetric non-metric distance: \u03c1IG(p, q) 6= \u03c1IG(q, p). In differential geometry, the structure of a manifold is defined by two components: (i) A metric tensor g that allows to define an inner product \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009p at each tangent space (for measuring vector lengths and angles between vectors), and (ii) a connection \u2207 that defines parallel transport \u220f\u2207p,q , i.e., a way to move a vector from one tangent plane Tp to any other one Tq . For FHR geometry, the implicitly used connection is called the Levi-Civita connection that is induced by the metric g: \u2207LC = \u2207(g). It is a metric connection since it ensures that \u3008u, v\u3009p = \u3008\u220f\u2207LCp,q u,\u220f\u2207LCp,q v\u3009q . The underlying information-geometric structure of KL is characterized by a pair of dual connections [2] \u2207 = \u2207(\u22121) (mixture connection) and \u2207\u2217 = \u2207(1) (exponential connection) that induces two dual geodesics (technically, \u00b11-autoparallel curves [15]). Those connections are said flat as they define two dual affine coordinate systems \u03b8 and \u03b7 on which the \u03b8- and \u03b7-geodesics are straight line segments, respectively. For multinomials, the expectation parameters are: \u03b7 = (\u03bb1, . . . , \u03bbd) and they 1-to-1 correspond to the natural parameters: \u03b8 = ( log \u03bb 1\n\u03bb0 , . . . , log \u03bbd \u03bb0\n) . Thus in IG, we have two kinds\nof midpoint multinomials of p and q depending on whether we perform the (linear) interpolation on the \u03b8or the \u03b7-geodesics. Informally speaking, the dual connections\u2207(\u00b11) are said coupled to the FIM since we have \u2207+\u2207 \u2217\n2 = \u2207(g) = \u2207LC. Those dual connections are not metric connections but enjoy the following property: \u3008u, v\u3009p = \u3008 \u220f p,qu, \u220f\u2217 p,qv\u3009q , where \u220f = \u220f\u2207 and \u220f\u2217 = \u220f\u2207\u2217 are the corresponding induced dual parallel transports. The geometry of f -divergences [3] is the \u03b1-geometry (for \u03b1 = 3 + 2f \u2032\u2032\u2032(1)) with the dual \u00b1\u03b1-connections, where \u2207(\u03b1) = 1+\u03b12 \u2207\u2217 + 1\u2212\u03b12 \u2207. The Levi-Civita metric connection is \u2207LC = \u2207(0). More generally, it was shown how to build a dual information-geometric structure for any divergence [3]. For example, we can build a dual structure from the symmetric Cauchy-Schwarz divergence [27]:\n\u03c1CS(p, q) = \u2212 log \u3008\u03bbp, \u03bbq\u3009\u221a\n\u3008\u03bbp, \u03bbp\u3009\u3008\u03bbq, \u03bbq\u3009 .

Then the Hilbert metric distance [14] is defined by:\n\u03c1HG(M,M \u2032) = { \u2223\u2223\u2223log |A\u2032M ||AM \u2032||A\u2032M \u2032||AM | \u2223\u2223\u2223 , M 6= M \u2032, 0 M = M \u2032.\n(4)\nIt is also called the Hilbert cross-ratio metric distance [24, 33]. Notice that we take the absolute value of the logarithm since the Hilbert distance is a signed distance [52]. When C is the unit ball, HG let us recover the Klein hyperbolic geometry [33]. When C is a quadric bounded convex domain, we obtain the Cayley-Klein hyperbolic geometry [12] which can be studied with the Riemannian structure and corresponding metric distance called the curved Mahalanobis distances [39, 38]. Cayley-Klein hyperbolic geometries have negative curvature.\nIn Hilbert geometry, the geodesics are straight Euclidean lines making it convenient for computation. Furthermore, the domain bounday \u2202C need not to be smooth: One may also consider bounded polytopes [11]. This is particularly interesting for modeling \u2206d, the d-dimensional open standard simplex. We call this geometry: The Hilbert simplex geometry. In Fig. (2), we show that the Hilbert distance\nbetween two multinomial distributions p (M ) and q (M \u2032) can be computed by finding the two intersection points of the line p(t) = (1 \u2212 t)p + tq with \u2202\u2206d, denoted as t0 \u2264 0 and t1 \u2265 1.

The shape of balls in polytope-domain HG are Euclidean polytopes [33], as depicted in Figure 3. Furthermore, the Euclidean shape of the balls do not change with the radius. Hilbert balls have hexagons shapes in 2D [45], rhombic dodecahedra shapes in 3D, and are polytopes [33] with d(d+ 1) facets in dimension d. When the polytope domain is not a simplex, the combinatorial complexity of balls depends on the center location [45], see Figure 4. The HG of the probability simplex yields a non-Riemannian metric geometry because at infinitesimal radius value, the balls are polytopes and not ellipsoidal balls (corresponding to squared Mahalanobis distance balls used to visualize metric tensors [31]). The isometries in Hilbert polyhedral geometries are studied in [34]. In Appendix B, we recall that any Hilbert geometry induces a Finslerian structure that becomes Riemannian iff the boundary is an ellipsoid (yielding the hyperbolic Cayley-Klein geometries [52]). Let us notice that in Hilbert simplex/polytope geometry, the geodesics are not unique (see Figure 2 of [24]).\nTable 1 summarizes the characteristics of the three introduced geometries: FHR, IG, and HG."}, {"heading": "3 Computing Hilbert distance in \u2206d", "text": "Let us first start by the simplest case: The 1D probability simplex \u22061, the space of Bernoulli distributions.

In 2D, the Hilbert ball polygonal shapes can range from s to 2s edges where s is the number of edges of the boundary Hilbert domain \u2202C.\nSince a Riemannian geometry is locally defined by a metric tensor, at infinitesimal scales, Riemannian balls have Mahalanobis smooth ellipsoidal shapes: B\u03c1(c, r) = {x : (x \u2212 c)>g(c)(x \u2212 c) \u2264 r2}. This property allows one to visualize Riemannian metric tensors [31]. Thus we conclude that:\nLemma 2 ([33]) Hilbert simplex geometry is a non-manifold metric length space.\nAs a remark, let us notice that slicing a simplex with a hyperplane does not always produce a lowerdimensional simplex. For example, slicing a tetrahedron by a plane yields either a triangle or a quadrilateral.

When dealing with k = 1 cluster, the center (also called centroid or cluster prototype) is the center of mass. For an arbitrary dissimilarity measure D(\u00b7 : \u00b7), the centroid c defined as the minimizer of\nED(\u039b, c) = 1\nn n\u2211 i=1 D(\u03bbi : c),\nmay not be available in closed form. Nevertheless, using a generalization of the k-means initialization [6] (picking randomly seeds), one can bypass the centroid computation, and yet guarantee probabilistically a good clustering.\nLet C = {c1, . . . , ck} denote the set of k cluster centers. Then the generalized k-means energy to minimize is defined by:\nED(\u039b, C) = 1\nn n\u2211 i=1 min j\u2208{1,...,k} D(\u03bbi : cj).\nBy defining the distance D(\u03bb,C) = minj\u2208{1,...,k}D(\u03bb : cj) of a point to a set, we rewrite the objective function as follows: ED(\u039b, C) = 1n \u2211n i=1D(\u03bbi, C). Let E \u2217 D(\u039b, k) = minC : |C|=k ED(\u039b, C) denote the global minimum. The k-means++ seeding proceeds for an arbitrary divergenceD as follows: Pick uniformly at random at first seed c1, and iteratively choose the (k \u2212 1) remaining seeds according to the following probability distribution:\nPr(ci = x) = D(x, {c1, . . . , ci\u22121})\u2211 y\u2208X D(y, {c1, . . . , ci\u22121}) .\nSince its inception (2007), this k-means++ seeding has been extensively studied [7]. We state the general theorem established in [43]:\nTheorem 2 (Generalized k-means++ performance [43]) Let \u03ba1 and \u03ba2 be two constants such that \u03ba1 defines the quasi-triangular inequality property:\nD(x : z) \u2264 \u03ba1 (D(x : y) +D(y : z)) ,\u2200x, y, z \u2208 \u2206d, and \u03ba2 handles the symmetry inequality:\nD(x : y) \u2264 \u03ba2D(y : x),\u2200x, y \u2208 \u2206d. Then the generalized k-means++ seeding guarantees with high probability a configuration C of cluster centers such that: ED(\u039b, C) \u2264 2\u03ba21(1 + \u03ba2)(2 + log k)E\u2217D(\u039b, k). (5) The ratio ED(\u039b,C)E\u2217D(\u039b,k) is called the competitive factor [6]. The seminal result of ordinary k-means++ yields a 8(2 + log k)-competitive factor. Since divergences may be asymmetric, one can further consider mixed divergence M(p : q : r) = \u03bbD(p : q) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)D(q : r) for \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], and extend the k-means++ seeding procedure and analysis, see [44].\nNote that squared metric distances are not metric because they do not satisfy the triangular inequality. For example, the squared Euclidean distance is not a metric but it satisfies the 2-quasi triangular inequality.\nAs an empirical study, we randomly generate n = 105 tuples (x, y, z) based on the uniform distribution in \u2206d. For each tuple (x, y, z), we evaluate the ratio\n\u03ba1 = D(x : z)\nD(x : y) +D(y : z) .\nFigure 7 shows the statistics for three different choices of D: (1) D(x : y) = \u03c12FHR(x, y); (2) D(x : y) = 1 2KL(x : y) + 1 2KL(y : x); (3) D(x : y) = \u03c1 2 HG(x, y). We find experimentally that \u03ba1 is upper bounded by 2 for both \u03c1FHR and \u03c1HG, while the average \u03ba1 value is much smaller. For all the compared distances, \u03ba2 = 1. Therefore \u03c1FHR and \u03c1HG have better k-means++ performance guarantee as compared to \u03c1IG.\nWe state the following general performance theorem:\nTheorem 3 (k-means++ in an inner product space) In any inner product space (X , \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009), the kmeans++ seeding is 16(2 + log k)-competitive.\nProof: In an inner product space (X , \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009), we can define the norm \u2016x\u2016 = \u221a \u3008x, x\u3009 and induced distance D(x, y) = \u2016x\u2212 y\u2016. Furthermore, the parallelogram law holds in an inner product space:\n2\u2016x\u20162 + 2\u2016y\u20162 = \u2016x+ y\u20162 + \u2016x\u2212 y\u20162."}, {"heading": "It follows that \u2016x\u2032 \u2212 y\u2032\u20162 \u2264 2(\u2016x\u2032\u20162 + \u2016y\u2032\u20162) since \u2016x\u2032 + y\u2032\u20162 \u2265 0.

The KL divergence can be interpreted as a separable Bregman divergence [1]. The Bregman kmeans++ performance has been studied in [1, 36], and a competitive factor of O( 1\u00b5 ) is reported using the notion of Bregman \u00b5-similarity (that is suited for data-sets on a compact domain).\nIn [21], spherical k-means++ is studied with respect to the distance dS(x, y) = 1\u2212\u3008x, y\u3009 for any pair of points x, y on the unit sphere. Since \u3008x, y\u3009 = \u2016x\u20162\u2016y\u20162 cos(\u03b8x,y) = cos(\u03b8x,y), we have dS(x, y) = 1 \u2212 cos(\u03b8x,y), where \u03b8x,y denotes the angle between unit vectors x and y. This distance is called the cosine distance since it amounts to one minus the cosine similarity. Notice that the cosine distance is related to the squared Euclidean distance via the identity: dS(x, y) = 12\u2016x\u2212 y\u20162. The cosine distance is different from the spherical distance that relies on the arccos function.\nWe need to report a bound for the squared Hilbert symmetric distance (\u03ba2 = 1). In [33] (Theorem 3.3), it was shown that Hilbert geometry of a bounded convex domain C is isometric to a normed vector space iff C is an open simplex: (\u2206d, \u03c1HG) ' (Vd, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016H) where \u2016x\u2016H is the corresponding norm. Appendix A recalls the construction due to De La Harpe [24] in 1991. We write NH for short for this equivalent normed Hilbert geometry. The squared Hilbert distance fails the triangle inequality, and it is not a distance induced by an inner product (see Appendix A).\nHowever, in a finite dimensional vector space, all norms are \u201cequivalent,\u201d meaning that there exist two positive constants \u03b1 and \u03b2 such that:\n\u03b1\u2016v\u20162 \u2264 \u2016v\u2016H \u2264 \u03b2\u2016v\u20162. (6)\nFigure 8 shows an empirical range of the ratio \u2016v\u2016H\u2016v\u2016l for l = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 4. The ratio \u03b1 and \u03b2 depend on the dimension of the simplex \u2206d. For example, when d = 10, one can observe that empirically \u03b1 \u2248 0.7, \u03b2 \u2248 1.4.\nWe therefore get the following lemma:\nLemma 3 (Quasi-triangular inequality in Hilbert simplex geometry) In a Hilbert simplex geometry, \u03ba1 \u2264 2 ( \u03b2 \u03b1 )2 .\nProof: From \u03b1\u2016v\u20162 \u2264 \u2016v\u2016H \u2264 \u03b2\u2016v\u20162, we get:\n\u03b12\u2016vp \u2212 vq\u201622 \u2264 \u03c12HG(p, q) = \u2016vp \u2212 vq\u20162H \u2264 \u03b22\u2016vp \u2212 vq\u201622,\nwhere vp and vq are the equivalent points in the normed space corresponding to point p and q, respectively. Let DE(vp, vq) = \u2016vp \u2212 vq\u2016 denote the Euclidean distance. Since \u03c12HG(p, q) \u2264 \u03b22D2E(vp, vq) and that D2E satisfies the 2-quasi-triangular inequality, we get:\n\u03c12HG(p, q) \u2264 2\u03b22(D2E(vp, vr) +D2E(vr, vq)), \u2200vp, vq, vr \u2208 Vd.\nBut DE(vx, vy)2 \u2264 1\u03b12 \u03c12HG(x, y). It follows that:\n\u03c12HG(p, q) \u2264 2 \u03b22\n\u03b12 (\u03c12HG(p, r) + \u03c1 2 HG(r, q)).\nTherefore the squared Hilbert distance in a simplex satisfies the \u03ba1-triangular inequality for \u03ba1 = 2 ( \u03b2 \u03b1 )2 .\nThus we get by applying Theorem 3:\nTheorem 4 (k-means++ in Hilbert simplex geometry) The k-means++ seeding in a Hilbert simplex geometry in fixed dimension is 16 ( \u03b2 \u03b1 )4 (2 + log k)-competitive.\nThe constants \u03b1 and \u03b2 depend on the dimension of the Hilbert simplex geometry. Figure 6 displays the results of a k-means++ clustering in Hilbert simplex geometry for k \u2208 {3, 5}.\nNote that for a given data set, we can compute \u03ba1 or \u03ba2 by inspecting triples and pairs of points, and get data-dependent competitive factor improving the bounds mentioned above.\n4.2 k-Center clustering Let X be a finite point set. The cost function for a k-center clustering with centers C (|C| = k) is:\nmax x\u2208X min y\u2208C D(x : y).\nThe farthest first traversal heuristic of Gonzalez [23] has a guaranteed approximation factor of 2 for any metric distance (see Algorithm 2).\nAlgorithm 2: A 2-approximation of the k-center clustering for any metric distance \u03c1.

In both spaces, the shapes of the balls are convex. Let X = {x1, . . . , xd} denote the point set in \u2206d, and V = {v1, . . . , vd} the equivalent point set in the normed vector space (following the mapping explained in Appendix A). Then the SEBs BHG(X ) in \u2206d and BNH(V) in Vd have radii r\u2217HG and r\u2217H defined by:\nr\u2217HG = min c\u2208\u2206d max i\u2208{1,...,n} \u03c1HG(xi, c), (7)\nr\u2217H = min v\u2208Vd max i\u2208{1,...,n} \u2016vi \u2212 v\u2016H . (8)\nIt follows from the inequalities of Eq. 6 that:\n\u03b1r\u2217E \u2264 rH \u2264 \u03b2r\u2217E ,\nwhere r\u2217E is the radius of the SEB with respect to the Euclidean distance of the points v1 . . . , vn. The SEB in the normed vector space (Vd, \u2016\u00b7\u2016H) amounts to find the minimum covering norm polytope of a finite point set. This problem has been well-studied in computational geometry: See [53, 13, 48]. By considering the equivalent Hilbert norm polytope with d(d+ 1) facets, we state the result of [53]:\nTheorem 5 (SEB in Hilbert polytope normed space [53]) A (1 + )-approximation of the SEB in Vd can be computed in O(d3 n ).\nWe shall now report two algorithms for computing the SEBs: One exact algorithm in Vd that do not scale well in high dimensions, and one approximation algorithm in \u2206d that works well for large dimensions."}, {"heading": "4.2.1 Exact smallest enclosing ball in a Hilbert simplex geometry", "text": "Given a finite point set {x1, . . . , xn} \u2208 \u2206d, we define the Smallest Enclosing Ball (SEB) in Hilbert simplex geometry as:\nr\u2217 = min c\u2208\u2206d max i\u2208{1,...,n} \u03c1HG(c, xi). (9)\nThe radius of the SEB is r\u2217. Consider the equivalent problem of finding the SEB in the isometric normed vector space via the mapping reported in Appendix A. To each simplex point xi corresponds a point vi in the normed vector space Vd.\nFigure 10 displays some examples of the exact smallest enclosing balls in the Hilbert simplex geometry and the corresponding normed vector space.\nTo compute the SEB, one may also consider the generic LP-type randomized algorithm [41]. We notice that an enclosing ball for a point set in general position as a number k of points on the border of the ball, with 2 \u2264 k \u2264 d(d+1)2 . Let D = d(d+1) 2 denote the varying size of the combinatorial basis: Then we can apply the LP-type framework (we check the axioms of locality and monotonicity [54]) to solve efficiently for the SEBs.\nTheorem 6 (Smallest Enclosing Hilbert ball is LP-type [59, 54]) The smallest enclosing Hilbert ball amounts to find the smallest enclosing ball in a vector space with respect to a polytope norm that can be solved using a LP-type randomized algorithm.\nThe Enclosing Ball Decision Problem [42] (EBDP) asks for a given value r, whether r \u2265 r\u2217 or not. The decision problem amounts to find whether a set {rBV + vi} of translates can be stabbed by a point [42]: That is, whether \u2229ni=1(rBV + vi) is empty or not. Since the translates are polytopes with d(d+ 1) facets, this can be solved in linear time using Linear Programming.\nTheorem 7 (Enclosing Hilbert Ball Decision Problem) The decision problem to test whether r \u2265 r\u2217 or not can be solved by Linear Programming.\nThis yields a simple scheme to approximate the optimal value r\u2217: Let r0 = maxi\u2208{1,...,n} \u2016vi\u2212v1\u2016H . Then r\u2217 \u2208 [ r02 , r0] = [a0, b0]. At stage i, perform a dichotomic search on [ai, bi] by answering the decision problem for ri = bi\u2212ai2 , and update the radius range accordingly, see [42].\nHowever, the LP-type randomized algorithm or the decision problem-based algorithm do not scale well with dimensions. Next, we introduce a simple approximation algorithm that relies on the fact that the line segment [pq] is a geodesic in Hilbert simplex geometry. (Geodesics are not unique, see Figure 2 of [24])"}, {"heading": "4.2.2 Geodesic bisection approximation heuristic", "text": "In Riemannian geometry, the 1-center can be arbitrarily finely approximated by a simple geodesic bisection algorithm [9, 5] This algorithm can be extended to HG straightforwardly as detailed in Algorithm 3: The algorithm first picks up a point c0 at random from X for the initial center, computes the farthest point fi (with respect to the distance \u03c1), and walk on the geodesic from c0 to fi by a certain amount to define c1, etc. For an arbitrary distance \u03c1, we define the operator #\u03c1\u03b1 as follows:\np#\u03c1\u03b1q = v = \u03b3(p, q, \u03b1), \u03c1(p : v) = \u03b1\u03c1(p : q),\nwhere \u03b3(p, q, \u03b1) is the geodesic passing through p and q, and parameterized by \u03b1 (0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1).

See [13] for coreset results concerning containment problems with respect to a convex homothetic object (the equivalent Hilbert polytope norm in our case).\nPanigrahy [48] described as simple algorithm dubbed MINCON for finding an approximation of the Minimum Enclosing Polytope. The algorithm induces a core-set of size O( 1 2 ) although the theorem is challenged in [13].\nSee Fig (9) to get an intuitive idea on the experimental convergence rate of Algorithm 3.

Let \u03c3 = 0, we get \u03bbi = \u03bbic. Therefore p is randomly distributed around c.

The number of clusters k is set to the true number of clusters to avoid model selection. For each configuration, we repeat the clustering experiment based on 300 different random datasets. The performance is measured by the cluttering accuracy, which is the percentage of clustering labels coinciding with the ground truth labels during the data generating process.\nThe results are shown in Table 2. The large variance of the accuracy is because that each experiment is performed on different datasets given by the same generator based on different random seeds. Generally, the performance deteriorates as we increase the number of clusters, increase the noise level or decrease the dimensionality, which have the same effect to reduce the gap among the clusters.\nThe key comparison is the three columns \u03c1FHR, \u03c1HG and \u03c1IG, as they are based on exactly the same algorithm (k-center) with the only difference being the underlying geometry. We see clearly that the performance of the three compared geometries presents the order HG > FHR > IG. The performance\nof HG is superior to the other two geometries, especially when the noise level is large. Intuitively, the Hilbert balls are more compact and therefore can better capture the clustering structure (see Fig. (1)).\nThe column \u03c1IG (k-means) is the k-means clustering based on \u03c1IG. It shows better performance than \u03c1IG because k-means is more robust than k-center to noise. Ideally we should compare k-means based on FHR, IG and HG. However the centroid computation of FHR and HG are not developed yet. This is left to future work.\nThe column \u03c1EUC represents k-center based on the Euclidean enclosing ball.

The main feature of HG is that it is a metric non-manifold geometry where geodesics are straight (Euclidean) line segments. For simplex domains, the Hilbert balls have fixed combinatorial (Euclidean) polytope structures, and HG is known to be isometric to a normed space [24, 22]. This latter isometry allows one to generalize easily the standard\nproofs of clustering (e.g., k-means or k-center). We demonstrated it for the k-means++ competitive performance analysis, and for the convergence of the 1-center heuristic [9] (smallest enclosing Hilbert ball allows one to implement efficiently the k-center clustering). Our experimental k-means++/k-center comparisons of HG algorithms with the manifold modeling approach yield striking superior performance: This may be explained by the sharpness of Hilbert balls with respect to the FHR/IG ball profiles.\nChentsov [17] defined statistical invariance on a probability manifold under Markov morphisms, and proved that the Fisher Information Metric (FIM) is the unique Riemannian metric (up to rescaling) for multinomials. However, this does not rule out that other distances (with underlying geometric structures) may be used to model statistical manifolds (eg., Finsler statistical manifolds [16, 55], or the total variation distance \u2014 the only metric f -divergence [29]). Defining statistical invariance related to geometry is the cornerstone problem of information geometry that can be tackled from many directions (see [20] and references therein for a short review). We hope to have fostered interest in considering the potential of Hilbert probability simplex geometry in artificial intelligence. One future direction is to consider the Hilbert metric for regularization and sparsity in machine learning (due to its equivalence with a polytope normed distance).\nOur Python codes are freely available online for reproducible research: https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/\u02dcnielsen/HSG/"}, {"heading": "B Hilbert geometry with Finslerian/Riemannian structures", "text": "In a Riemannian geometry, each tangent plane TpM of the d-dimensional manifold M is equivalent to Rd: TpM ' Rd.

Finslerian geometry thus generalizes Riemannian geometry by taking into account generic symmetric convex objects instead of ellipsoids for inducing norms at each tangent plane.
