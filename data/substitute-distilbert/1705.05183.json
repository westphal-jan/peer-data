INTRODUCTION\nDevelopment of new drugs is associated with huge investment of time and money, and risk of failure in clinical trials. It has been estimated that on an average drug development process takes 15 years [1] and associated cost is approximately $1 billion[2]. Finding novel indications for approved drugs, referred as drug repositioning or drug repurposing(DR), has attracted researchers and pharmaceutical industry as a costeffective and faster alternative to overcome this challenge [3]. The candidates for drug repositioning are drugs which are already in market or which have been discontinued due to various reasons other than safety issues. As per the estimate in [3], DR allows a significant reduction in time from 10- 17 years to 3-12 years in novel drug discovery. According to [4], among all the drugs which have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), approximately 30% of them were the result of drug repositioning. Significant\nexamples of drug repositioning includes Aspirin (regular use as analgesic and now also being widely adapted to treat heart related disease [5]), Plerixafor (initially developed to treat HIV but later being used as a drug to mobilize stem cells [6]), and Thalidomide (initially developed to treat nausea but after drug repositioning research, being used to treat dermatological issues and the myelome disease [7]).\nThere have been significant number of methods developed for the drug repositioning problem including machine learning methods. We summarize the prominent methods in the section V. Working principle of all methods rely on two important aspects related to drugs and diseases. First, drugs often bind to multiple targets resulting into various biological effects including side-effects [8]. Second, a biological target of a drug which is relevant to a particular disease, may also be directly or indirectly associated with other diseases. In other words, overlapping pathways or common associated targets between various diseases are an important factor and thereby making it possible that an approved drug for one disease may be useful in treating a similar disease [9].\nExisting methods of identifying drug-disease association majorly rely on the information available in the structured databases only. However these databases are unable to keep pace with the exponential growth of information appearing in research articles. In this paper, our primary aim is to develop a method which can exploit information present in free texts as well as in structured databases. In recent years, vector representation of words, learned using neural network based methods from a large corpora of free texts, have been shown to give significant performance for several natural language processing tasks. Word vectors thus obtained are also shown to capture syntactic and semantic properties. We employ a novel method to learn representation of each drug and disease terms which then are projected on a common vector space to obtain similarity between drugs and diseases. Towards this end, first we learn vector representation of drugs and diseases by using the knowledge present in literature. Next, these vectors are updated to accommodate various similarity measures of drugs and diseases respectively. The resultant drug and disease vector representation are not necessarily in the same vector-space. So we employ matrix completion approach [10] to learn a projection matrix between drug and disease vector space. We\nevaluate the performance of our method using ten fold cross validation and top k rank threshold methods and compare it with 3 other competitive methods. We further perform case studies on Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Hypertension and verify our predictions for these disease from literature. Our study shows that all our top ten drugs predicted for Alzheimer\u2019s disease are approved to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Similarity 7 out 10 drugs predicted for Hypertension are approved and 2 out of remaining 3 are used to treat Ocular Hypertension."}, {"heading": "II. MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "In this section we give details about the dataset we have used and later we describe our method which includes learning the feature vector and learning the projection matrix between drug and disease vector space."}, {"heading": "A. Dataset", "text": "This section describes all datasets and their source used in\nthis work.\n1) Drug-Disease Association Data-\nWe use the same drug-disease association data as used in PREDICT [11]. Data is made available as the supplementary material of the corresponding paper [11]. It contains 1933 drug-disease associations between 593 drugs and 313 diseases. All 593 drugs are registered in DrugBank [12] and all 313 diseases are listed in OMIM[13] database. As we have mentioned earlier that the proposed method rely on obtaining word embedding for each drug and disease from a huge corpus of biomedical articles, we have to discard some drugs and diseases which we could not find appearing in the corpus. Finally we consider 584 drugs, 294 diseases and 1854 drugdisease associations known between them. 2) SIDER: Drug Side Effect Data- We obtain the list\nof side effects corresponding to all 584 drugs from the SIDER [14] database. 3) Chemical Fingerprint of Drugs- Chemical fingerprint\nof a drug corresponds to the record of component fragment present in their chemical structure. For each drug their chemical fingerprint was obtained from the DrugBank [12]. 4) DrugBank- Similar to the chemical fingerprint of drugs,\ndrug targets are obtained from the DrugBank. Drug targets one or more cellular molecules such as metabolites or proteins for desired effects. A list of targets\ncorresponding to all 584 drugs are obtained. 5) DisGeNet: Disease Associated Genes-We collect genes\nassociated with disease from DisGeNET [15]."}, {"heading": "B. Construction of similarity measures", "text": "We calculate three types of similarity for drugs which are based upon side-effects, chemical structure and target proteins. Two similarities are calculated for each disease pair which are based upon the disease phenotypes and associated genes.\n1) Drug Similarity measures:\nI Side effect similarity : A side effect is an undesired\nconsequence of a drug. Drugs cause side-effects when they bind to off-target apart from their desired on-targets. Under the assumption that if 2 drugs share side-effects and hence off-targets, there is a possibility that they might share on-targets which can be used to cure diseases. Studies[16] show that drugs sharing off targets might also share on targets. For each drug pair (di, dj), this similarity is :\nSim(di, dj) = |SE(di) \u2229 SE(dj)|\n|SE(di) \u222a SE(dj)|\nwhere SE(d) is the set of side-effects related to drug d. II Chemical Similarity : Similarity of two chemicals is\nbased upon comparing their chemical fingerprint. A fingerprint is a record of component fragment present in a chemical structure. It has been shown in [17] that Tanimoto coefficient can be an effective measure to calculate similarity between two chemicals based on their structures. Pairwise similarity between two drugs was calculated as Tanimoto score of their fingerprint using RDKit[18] library of Python. III Drug-Target Similarity : A biological target is the protein\nin the body which is either up regulated or down regulated due to the action of a particular drug on it . If two drugs share same targets, the probability of them causing the similar effect may also increase. Pairwise drug-target similarity between drugs di and dj is calculated as :\nSim(di, dj) = 1\n|P (di)||P (dj)|\nP (di)\u2211\ni=1\nP (dj)\u2211\nj=1\nSW (P (di), P (dj))\nwhere P (d) denotes the set of genes associated to drug d and SW is the Smith-Waterman Sequence alignment score[19].\n2) Disease Similarity measures:\nI Phenotypic similarity : A phenotypic feature is an ob-\nservable biological or clinical characteristic of a disease. It is a amalgamation of gene expression as well as influence of external environmental factors. The similarity is collected from MIMMiner Tool [20]. The tool measures disease similarity by computing similarity between MeSH terms[21] that appear in the medical description of diseases in the OMIM database. II Gene Similarity : Disease causing or associated genes\nare collected from DisGeNET[15]. Pairwise gene similarity between disease di and dj is calculated as:\nSim(di, dj) = 1\n|P (di)||P (dj)|\nP (di)\u2211\ni=1\nP (dj)\u2211\nj=1\nSW (P (di), P (dj))\nwhere P (d) denotes the set of genes associated to disease d and SW is the Smith-Waterman Sequence alignment score[19]."}, {"heading": "C. Method", "text": "The proposed method has three major steps. In the first step we obtain vector representation of drugs and diseases using neural embedding method[22]. We update these representations using similarity scores calculated from the various structured dataset. And in the last step, we learn a projection matrix between the two vector-spaces so that a final association score between drug-disease pair can be obtained. It is noteworthy to mention here again that there is no requirement of negative datasets. Figure 1 summarizes the proposed method.\n1) Word vectors for drugs and diseases: To capture the information present in literature, we obtain the word vector representation of drugs and diseases. We use Pubmed[23] open access set as our corpus. Each disease is mapped to its OMIM id. As diseases can appear under various names in Pubmed[23] corpus, each disease in the corpus is mapped to a Concept Unique Identifier(CUI) by using UMLS Meta thesaurus[24]. If a disease(OMIM indication) has multiple concept names associated to it, then the resultant vector is taken as the simple average of all the vectors associated to that OMIM indication. The concept names for each OMIM indication is obtained from Supplementary Information of PREDICT[11]. Word vector representation of each drug and disease is obtained by training Pubmed Corpus using word2Vec[25] Python library. To train vectors, we set window size to 5. We have experimented using various vector dimensions ranging from 100 to 200.\n2) Learning vector representation by combining similarity measures: Let Nd be the number of drugs and Ns be the number of diseases. Each drug word vector is denoted as di \u2208 R N , where i ranges from 1 to Nd. Each disease word vector is denoted as si \u2208 R N , where i ranges from 1 to Ns. Let the updated drug vector (feature vector) for i th drug be denoted as d\u0303i, which is initialized to di. Let the updated\ndisease vector (feature vector) for ith disease be denoted as s\u0303i, which is initialized to si. Let Simk(i, j) denote the k th similarity between drug i and drug j or disease i and disease j. Let M be the number of drug similarity measures and L be the number of disease similarity measures. The motive is to obtain a feature vector for each drug and disease by combining the above mentioned similarities and updating the word vectors. For each drug i ( i varies from 1 to Nd), d\u0303i is updated when the below objective ( J1 ) is minimized:\nJ1 =\nNd\u2211\nj=1\nM\u2211\nk=1\n( d\u0303i.dj\n|d\u0303i||dj | \u2212 Simk(i, j))\n2\nwhere |di| denote the length of the vector di .\nEach drug word vector is updated using all the other drug vectors and for each similarity measure. The updated set of drug vectors (called feature vectors) is denoted as D = [d\u03031, d\u03032, ..., \u02dcdNd ], where each d\u0303i \u2208 R N .\nSimilar kind of objective ( J2 ) is minimized for all disease\ns\u0303i, where i varies from 1 to Ns .\nJ2 =\nNs\u2211\nj=1\nL\u2211\nk=1\n( s\u0303i.sj\n|s\u0303i||sj | \u2212 Simk(i, j))\n2\nwhere |si| denote the length of the vector si.\nEach disease word vector is updated using all the other disease vectors and for each similarity measure. The updated set of disease vectors(called feature vectors) is denoted as S = [s\u03031, s\u03032, ..., \u02dcsNs ], where each s\u0303i \u2208 R N .\nThe optimization problem is solved using Theano[26] library of Python. We have obtained a drug vector space and a disease vector space where each vector is of dimension RN . 3) Learning projection from drug vector space to disease vector space: Our motive is to learn a projection matrix from drug vector space to disease vector space which will help us in predicting drug-disease association scores. The projection matrix should be such that the projected drug vectors are geometrically close to vectors of their well known disease vectors. The drugs that are in proximity in the directions of their feature vectors may share diseases and vice-versa. Let I \u2208 RNd\u00d7Ns be called the association matrix where Iij is 1 if drugi treats diseasej else 0. The projection matrix is denoted as Z \u2208 RN\u00d7N . To learn this projection matrix we use inductive matrix completion approach[10], [27] which minimizes the following objective function:\nmin G,H\n\u2211\ni,j\n||Iij \u2212 d\u0303iGH T s\u0303j T ||2 + \u03bb\n2 (||G||2 + ||H ||2)\nwhere the projection matrix Z = GHT , where G \u2208 RN\u00d7K and H \u2208 RN\u00d7K . The score of a drug i and disease j pair is calculated as:\nscore(i, j) = d\u0303iZs\u0303j T\nHigher the score, greater is the possibility of drug i treating disease j ."}, {"heading": "III. EXPERIMENTS", "text": "We conduct 10-fold cross-validation experiments to evaluate the performance of all methods. We use AUC, ROC and toprank thresholds as evaluation metrics. In the top-rank threshold measure, a well known drug-disease association is considered as correctly predicted if its rank based on the predicted score is within the specified rank threshold."}, {"heading": "A. Baseline Methods", "text": "We compare the proposed method with three other methods, MBIRW [28], HGBI [29] and TP-NRWRH [30]. We briefly summarize each of the three methods for the sake of completeness.\nThe HGBI method creates a heterogeneous network of two different type of nodes. One set of nodes are representing different drugs and another set of nodes represent targets. Edges exist between within same node types as well as between two different node types. Existence of edge depends on drug-drug similarities, target-target similarities and drug-target interactions. The edge weights of the network are updated in an iterative fashion by incorporating all the paths between the drug-target pair.\nThe MBIRW method constructs two separate networks on drugs and diseases. Both similarity networks were created using novel similarity measure which takes into account correlation between different similarities. Further MBIRW performs bi-directional random walk on these two networks to get scores for drug disease associations.\nTP-NRWH again uses random walk method but on single heterogeneous drug-disease network. This network is similar to the network used in the the HGBI method and integrates all the similarity measures (drug-drug and disease-disease) and well known drug-disease associations. This is in contrast to the MBIRW method which creates two separate networks on drugs and diseases.\nWe use default parameter settings for all the three methods. Parameters of TP-NRWRH are set as (\u03b1 = 0.3, \u03bb = 0.8, \u03b7 = 0.4). For MBIRW \u03b1 is set to default 0.3 and max iterations for right and left random walk is set to 2. For HGBI, restart probability \u03b1 is set to default 0.4 and cut off was set to 0.3."}, {"heading": "IV. RESULTS", "text": "A. Vector representation\nFirst we analyze the performance of our method with respect to varying length of feature vectors between 100 and 200. Fig 2 shows AUC obtained by using different size of drugs and disease vectors. Although increasing dimension generally led to improved AUC score but improvement was not really significant. Next we analyze the importance of updating the word vectors based on similarity scores. We obtain an AUC score of 0.77 when word-vectors obtained using word2vec method on biomedical copora are not updated. On the other\nhand an AUC score of 0.86 is obtained when updated wordvectors are used. The relative improvement of 10% clearly indicates that the vectors learned through our method captured the similarity of drugs and diseases in better manner."}, {"heading": "B. Comparison with existing methods", "text": "Fig 3 shows the AUC values and the ROC of 10-fold crossvalidation experiments. Although the proposed method has obtained AUC value of 0.86 which is better than the one obtained by HGBI (0.79) but the other two methods were best performing methods. Similar observations are made based\non the top-rank threshold metric. The number of correctly predicted associations by our method is greater than that of HGBI for every top rank thresholds as shown in the Fig 4."}, {"heading": "C. Case Studies", "text": "After finding the performance of our model, we conducted leave-disease-out experiment. For this, first we select a disease and train our model only with the remaining data after excluding all known associations related to it. Then scores are calculated for the held out disease and top scoring drugs\nRank Drug Name Predicted Score Clinical Evidence Mean Score\nare reported. We perform the case studies on two diseases, Alzheimer and Hypertension.\n1) Alzheimer\u2019s Disease: Table I shows the top scoring\ndrugs predicted by the model for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Out of the top 10 drugs predicted by our method, 6 drugs namely Rivastigmine, Galantamine, Donepezil, Memantine, Tacrine and Valproic Acid have been approved for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Other drugs namely Ropinirole, Entacapone, Pramipexole and Carbidopa have been used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease. Although there is a difference in pathogenesis of Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but both of them are neuro-degenerative disease associated with aging[31]. Pramipexole has been under Phase 2 of Clinical trials (NCT01388478) [32] for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The above results have been verified from PREDICT[11] and DrugBank[12]. 2) Hypertension: Another indication, Hypertension was\nanalysed and its top scoring drugs are shown in Table II. Out of the top 10 drugs predicted by our method, 7 drugs namely Trandolapril, Prazosin, Mecamylamine, Labetalol, Captopril, Losartan and Valsartan are approved drugs for hypertension. Brinzolamide and Travoprost have been used for treating ocular hypertension. The scores of these top predicted drugs for treating Hypertension and Alzheimer\u2019s disease are much higher than the mean score of these drugs for all diseases."}, {"heading": "V. RELATED WORK", "text": "Several computational methods have been developed to solve the drug repositioning problem including machine learning as well as literature mining based methods. Literature mining methods mainly rely on co-occurrence of drug, disease and targets within a context [33], [34]. These methods generally have poor performance as they do not use any contextual semantic information and treat all types of relations between two relevant terms equivalently. On the other hand, machine learning based models have been shown to perform relatively better than co-occurrence based methods. Gottlieb et al. [11] developed a logistic regression based model and combined various similarity measures of drugs and diseases in order to predict drug-disease associations. Wang et al. [35] applied Support Vector Machine model on drug chemical structures, protein sequences and disease phenotypic data in order to identify new relations between drugs and diseases. One of the major issue faced by these methods is requirement of negative data, which is not available.\nNetwork based models are good alternative as they do not require both positive and negatively labeled data. Chiang et al. developed a network based model which predict novel indications for drugs based upon the fact that if two disease share treatment profiles, then drugs approved for one of those disease may be used to treat the other disease too. The method relied upon \u201dguilt by association\u201d technique[36]. Wang et al. developed a novel method which consists of threelayer heterogeneous graph model to integrate relationships between drugs, diseases and targets. Based on this model, an iterative algorithm was used in order to rank drugs for each disease. The method measures the strength between unlinked drug-target pairs by using all the paths in the network[37]. Martinez et al. developed the DrugNet method, a network - based prioritization method, that utilizes the information of drugs, diseases and drug targets and performs prioritization of drug-disease and disease-drug[38] associations. Lee et al. exploited the structural properties of biological networks. They developed shared neighborhood scoring algorithm and applied it on an integrated drug-protein-disease tripartite network in order to predict new indications for drugs[39]. Chen et al. utilized already existing recommendation systems ProbS and Heats to give recommendation score for disease with respect\nto drugs[40]. Wu et al. constructed a weighted heterogeneous network of drugs and diseases and applied clustering technique using ClusterONE[41] algorithm to predict new drug-disease associations[42]. Luo et al. improved drug-drug and diseasedisease similarity measures by using concepts of clustering and by performing various analysis on similarity values. Further they performed a bi-random walk on the similarity network and well known drug-disease associations and learned drugdisease association matrix[28]."}, {"heading": "VI.

approved drugs. The requirement of huge investment of time as well as money and risk of failure in clinical trials have led to surge in interest in drug repositioning. DR exploits two major aspects associated with drugs and diseases: existence of similarity among drugs and among diseases due to their shared involved genes or pathways or common biological effects. Existing methods of identifying drug-disease association majorly rely on the information available in the structured databases only. On the other hand, abundant information available in form of free texts in biomedical research articles are not being fully exploited. Word-embedding or obtaining vector representation of words from a large corpora of free texts using neural network methods have been shown to give significant performance for several natural language processing tasks. In this work we propose a novel way of representation learning to obtain features of drugs and diseases by combining complementary information available in unstructured texts and structured datasets. Next we use matrix completion approach on these feature vectors to learn projection matrix between drug and disease vector spaces. The proposed method has shown competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods. Further, the case studies on Alzheimer\u2019s and Hypertension diseases have shown that the predicted associations are matching with the existing knowledge.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
