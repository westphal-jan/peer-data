At the same time, machine learning algorithms have been shown to exhibit unexpected defects when deployed in the real world; examples include causality (i.e., inability to distinguish causal effects from correlations) [34, 16], fairness (i.e., internalizing prejudices present in training data) [22, 26], and algorithm aversion (i.e., lack of trust by end users) [19].\nInterpretability is a promising approach to address these challenges [38, 21]\u2014in particular, we can help human users diagnose issues and verify correctness of machine learning models by providing insight into the model\u2019s reasoning [43, 8, 37, 31, 29]. For example, suppose the user is trying to train a model that does not depend on a prejudiced feature (e.g., gender or ethnicity). Omitting the feature might not suffice to avoid prejudice, since the model could reconstruct that feature from other features [35]. A better approach might be to train the model with the prejudiced feature, and then assess the dependence of the model on that feature. This approach requires the ability to understand the model\u2019s reasoning process, i.e., how model predictions are affected by changing the prejudiced feature [21]. Similarly, the user may want to determine whether dependence on a feature is causal, or understand the high-level structure of the model to gain confidence in its correctness.\nIn this paper, we propose an technique that we call model extraction for interpreting the overall reasoning process performed by a model. Given a model f : X \u2192 Y , the interpretation produced by our algorithm is an approximation T (x) \u2248 f(x), where T is an interpretable model. In this paper, we take T to be a decision tree, which has been established as highly interpretable [31, 37, 8]. Intuitively, if T is a sufficiently good approximation of f , then any issues in f should be reflected in T as well. Thus, the user can understand and debug f by examining T ; then, the original model f can be deployed so that performance is not sacrificed.\nPrevious model extraction approaches have focused on interpreting specific families of models such as random forests [45, 18, 46], enabling them to leverage domain-specific knowledge about the internal structure of the model. In contrast, our approach is fully blackbox, i.e., it is agnostic to the\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n08 50\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n3 M\nay 2\n01 7\ninternal model structure and only requires the ability to run the model f on an input x \u2208 X and obtain its predicted output f(x) \u2208 Y . This way, not only is our approach very flexible in that it can work with any model family, but it is furthermore independent of the implementation details of a specific model family.\nThe key challenge to learning accurate decision trees is that they often overfit and obtain poor performance, whereas complex models such as random forests and deep neural nets are better regularized [9]. For example, random forests use ensembles of trees to avoid overfitting to specific features or training points.\nThus, our algorithm uses active learning to construct T from f\u2014it actively samples a large number of training points, and determines the corresponding label simply by computing y = f(x). The large quantity of data ensures that T does not overfit to the small set of initial training points. We prove that under mild assumptions, by generating a sufficient quantity of data, the extracted tree T converges to the exact greedy decision tree, i.e., it avoids overfitting since the sampling error goes to zero.\nWe implement our algorithm and evaluate its performance in two experiments. First, we use our algorithm to produce interpretations of random forests and neural nets, as well as for control policies trained using reinforcement learning. We show that our active learning approach substantially improves over using CART [11], a standard decision tree learning algorithm. Second, we demonstrate how the decision trees extracted can be used to debug issues with these models, for example, to assess the dependence on prejudiced features, to determine why certain models perform worse, and to understand the high-level structure of a learned control policy."}, {"heading": "1.1 Related Work", "text": "A number of approaches for improving interpretability have been proposed, which largely fall into three directions: (i) learning more interpretable models, (ii) providing explanations for individual model predictions, and (iii) providing an overall interpretation of a model.\nCART [11] is considered highly interpretable, but its accuracy is often lacking in practice; [31, 8] tackle this concern by producing sparse rule lists that resemble decision trees yet are non-greedy, thus enabling them to learn more accurate models without sacrificing interpretability. Alternatively, [43] proposes supersparse linear integer models, which are sparse linear models where the coefficients are integer valued, thus resembling risk-scoring systems constructed manually by humans for applications such as medical diagnosis or criminal rescidivism. This approach is extended by [27] for classification problems with binary features. Finally, [15] propose generalized additive models, which are linear combinations of arbitrarily complex single-feature models, as interpretable models.\nHowever, in many domains, the highest performing models are complex blackbox models with limited interpretability, e.g., neural nets or random forests. While interpretable models may achieve nearly comparable performance, sacrificing even a small amount of accuracy can be undesirable in settings with critical consequences such as medicine. One proposed approach is to use the blackbox model, but generate interpretations for every new test point along with the predicted output. For instance, given a new test point x, [37] generates an interpretation for the prediction f(x) by fitting a simple model locally around x and using this simple model to explain the prediction. Similarly, [32] uses the Shapley value to determine the most influential features for a given prediction. These approaches can help the user understand a specific prediction, but they cannot help understand the model as a whole, making it less useful for diagnosing problems with the model itself.\nOur paper takes the third approach, i.e., it interprets the model as a whole. Past techniques have focused on simply identifying influential features. For instance, the relative influence scores the contribution of each feature in tree-based models (e.g., random forests) [24]. Similarly, [39] proposes a method for computing influence scores for features in deep neural nets. However, these approaches cannot help understand more complex reasoning performed by the model, as is needed to understand the dependence of a model on prejudiced or potentially non-causal features.\nFinally, our model extraction algorithm is closely related to the idea of model compression [13], where a larger, more complex model is used to guide the training of a smaller, more efficient model. Our algorithm can be thought of as a model compression algorithm where the target model is a decision tree; it leverages active learning to avoid overfitting the decision tree."}, {"heading": "2 Problem Formulation", "text": "Our algorithm learns axis-aligned decision trees. We start by establishing notation. An axis-aligned constraint is a constraint C = (xi \u2264 t), where i \u2208 [d] and t \u2208 R. More general constraints can be built from existing constraints using negations \u00acC, conjunctions C1 \u2227 C2, and disjunctions C1 \u2228 C2. The feasible set of C is F(C) = {x \u2208 X | x satisfies C}. A decision tree T is a binary tree. Each internal node N = (NL, NR, C) of T has a left child node NL and a right child node NR, and is labeled with an axis-aligned constraint C = (xi \u2264 t). Each leaf node N = (y) of T is associated with a label y \u2208 Y . We use NT to denote the root node of T . The decision tree is interpreted as a function T : X \u2192 Y in the usual way. More precisely, a leaf node N = (y) is interpreted as a function N(x) = y, an internal node N = (NL, NR, C) is interpreted as a function N(x) = NL(x) if x \u2208 F(C), and N(x) = NR(x) otherwise. Then, T (x) = NT (x). For a node N \u2208 T , we let CN denote the conjunction of the constraints along the path from the root of T to N . More precisely, CN is defined recursively: for the root NT , we have CNT = True, and for an internal node N = (NL, NR, C), we have CNL = CN \u2227 C and CNR = CN \u2227 \u00acC. Then, given a training set Xtrain \u2286 X and blackbox access to a function f : X \u2192 Y , our goal is to learn a decision tree T : X \u2192 Y that approximates f . We focus on the case X = Rd and Y = [m] = {1, ...,m} (i.e., classification); our approach easily generalizes to the case where X contains categorical dimensions, and to the case Y = R (i.e., regression). For classification, we measure performance using accuracy relative to f on a held out test set, i.e.,\n1 |Xtest| \u2211 x\u2208Xtest I[T (x) = f(x)]. For binary classification, we use F1 score, and for regression, we use mean-squared error."}, {"heading": "3 Decision Tree Extraction Algorithm", "text": "Our algorithm is greedy, both for scalability and because it is a natural fit for interpretability, since more relevant features occur higher in the tree.

Recall that at each iteration, we have to select the node N with the highest potential gain to replace. Our algorithm does so by estimating the gain for all nodes; these estimates are constructed using a separate set of i.i.d. samples to ensure unbiasedness of the tree parameters.\nNext, we describe how our algorithm samples x \u223c P | C, where C is a conjunction of axis-aligned constraints:\nC = (xi1 \u2264 t1) \u2227 ... \u2227 (xik \u2264 tk) \u2227 (xj1 > s1) \u2227 ... \u2227 (xjh > sh).\nSome inequalities in C may be redundant. First, suppose there are two constraints xi \u2264 t and xi \u2264 t\u2032. Assume without loss of generality that t \u2264 t\u2032; then, the first constraint implies the second, so we can discard the latter. For a pair of constraints xi > s and xi > s\u2032, we can similarly discard one of them. Second, given two constraints xi \u2264 t and xi > s, we can assume that t \u2265 s; otherwise C is unsatisfiable, so the gain (1) would have been zero and the algorithm would have terminated. In summary, we can assume C contains at most one inequality (xi \u2264 t) and at most one inequality (xi > s) per i \u2208 [d], and if both are present, then the two are not mutually exclusive. For simplicity, we assume C contains both inequalities for each i \u2208 [d]:\nC = (s1 \u2264 x1 \u2264 t1) \u2227 ... \u2227 (sd \u2264 xd \u2264 td).\nNow, recall that P is a mixture of axis-aligned Gaussians, so it has probability density function\npP(x) = K\u2211 j=1 \u03c6j \u00b7 pN (\u00b5j ,\u03a3j)(x) = K\u2211 j=1 \u03c6j d\u220f i=1 pN (\u00b5ji,\u03c3ji)(xi),\nwhere \u03c3ji = (\u03a3j)ii. The conditional distribution is\npP|C(x) \u221d K\u2211 j=1 \u03c6j d\u220f i=1 pN (\u00b5ji,\u03c3ji)|C(xi) = K\u2211 j=1 \u03c6j d\u220f i=1 pN (\u00b5ji,\u03c3ji)|(si\u2264xi\u2264ti)(xi).\nSince the Gaussians are axis-aligned, the unnormalized probability of each component is\n\u03c6\u0303\u2032j = \u222b \u03c6j d\u220f i=1 pN (\u00b5ji,\u03c3ji)|(si\u2264xi\u2264ti)(xi)dx = \u03c6j d\u220f i=1 ( \u03a6 ( ti \u2212 \u00b5ji \u03c3ji ) \u2212 \u03a6 ( si \u2212 \u00b5ji \u03c3ji )) ,\nwhere \u03a6 is the cumulative density function of the standard Gaussian distribution N (0, 1).

A related result is [20], but their analysis is limited to discrete features, for which convergence is much easier to analyze. We give proofs in Appendix A.\nWe begin by describing our assumptions. First, we make mild assumptions about the distribution P . Assumption 1. The probability density function p(x) of the distribution P over X is continuous, bounded (i.e., p(x) \u2264 pmax), and has bounded domain (i.e., p(x) = 0 for |x| > xmax).\nTo satisfy this assumption, we can truncate the Gaussian mixture models used by our algorithm to X = {x \u2208 Rd | \u2016x\u2016\u221e \u2264 xmax}, for some xmax \u2208 R. Intuitively, for reasonably large xmax, this modification should not affect either the exact greedy tree or the approximate greedy tree by very much, since Gaussian distributions have exponential tails.\nOur next assumption says that the exact greedy tree is well defined: Assumption 2. We assume that the maximizers (i\u2217, t\u2217) of (1) and yL, yR of (3) are unique.\nOtherwise, multiple exact greedy trees exist; our extracted tree would converge to an arbitrary one.\nWe now define the notion in which the extracted tree converges to the exact tree. For simplicity, we additionally assume that we are learning complete decision trees of depth D. Definition 1. Let T, T \u2032 be complete decision trees of depth D. For > 0, we say T is an approximation of T \u2032 if Prx\u223cP [T (x) = T \u2032(x)] \u2264 . Let T \u2217 denote the exact greedy decision tree that is complete of depth D. For any , \u03b4 > 0, we say an extracted decision tree T is ( , \u03b4) exact if Pr[T is an approximation of T \u2217] \u2265 1\u2212 \u03b4, where the randomness is taken over the training samples x \u223c P obtained by our algorithm. Theorem 1. For any , \u03b4 > 0, there exists n \u2208 N such that the decision tree extracted by our algorithm using n samples per node is ( , \u03b4) exact.\nThe key challenge to proving Theorem 1 is accounting for the fact that small errors made early on in the tree introduce small errors into the constraints CN , which can recursively introduce small errors into the probabilities Prx\u223cPX [ \u00b7 | CN ] in the gain (1). The dependence of n in Theorem 1 on and \u03b4 depends on the gap of the exact greedy decision tree. Definition 2. Let P be a distribution over R, and let F (t) be an unnormalized cumulative distribution function for P . We say g : R \u2192 R is ( \u2032, \u03b4\u2032) gapped according to P if it has a unique maximizer t\u2217 = arg maxt\u2208R g(t), and for every t \u2208 R such that |F (t)\u2212F (t\u2217)| > \u2032, we have g(t\u2217) > g(t) + \u03b4\u2032.\nIn particular, our result depends on the relationship between \u2032 and \u03b4\u2032. For the special case where \u03b4\u2032 depends linearly on \u2032, we can obtain sample complexity bounds: Corollary 1. Let f : X \u2192 Y . Suppose that for every i \u2208 [d], there exists \u03ba > 0 such that for every \u2032 > 0, the gain function g(t) = G(i, t) in (1) is ( \u2032, \u03ba \u00b7 \u2032) gapped. Then, Theorem 1 holds for\nn \u2265 max {( 1 +\n16m\n( /2k)3/2 \u00b7 \u03ba\n)3D , 2D+1k\n\u03b4 , 4\n} .\nThe exponential dependence on depth is unavoidable since errors increase multiplicatively from a parent node to its children; in practice, depth is small (e.g., D \u2264 5), so this is not an issue. Besides the gap in the gain g, the value n must also be lower bounded by a function of the gap between the maxima of the gain functions across different dimensions i, as well as the gap in the objective (3) for choosing leaf node labels; we omit this additional term for clarity.\nAs we discuss in Appendix A.4, we intuitively expect axis-aligned random forests f to satisfy the premise of Corollary 1."}, {"heading": "5 Evaluation", "text": "We implement our algorithm on top of scikit-learn [14], and evaluate it in two ways. First, we show that it outperforms a baseline that uses CART [11], a popular decision tree learning algorithm. Second, we show how extracted decision trees can be used to understand and debug models."}, {"heading": "5.1 Comparison to Baseline Decision Tree Extraction Algorithm", "text": "First, we compare our algorithm to a baseline.\nDatasets. We study two applications. First, we interpret supervised learning models. We train both a random forest and a neural net on a number of classification and regression tasks, primarily from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [7]. We randomly split each dataset into 70% training set and 30% test set; all results are averaged over 10 splits.\nWe estimate a Gaussian mixture model P using the training set, with K = 50 components for smaller datasets (< 200 samples), and K = 100 components for larger datasets. Then, we extract a decision tree of size at most k = 31 (i.e., same size as a depth 5 tree; we show how our results vary with k later) from the model f according to P , using n = 2000 samples to estimate (1) and (3). The random forests, trained using scikit-learn, consist of 1000 CART trees, using Gini impurity for classification and MSE for regression. The neural nets, also trained using scikit-learn, are trained with 500 hidden units, ReLU activations, L-BFGS optimization, and regularization parameter \u03b1 = 10\u22125.\nSecond, we interpret Markov decision process (MDP) control policies \u03c0\u2217 : S \u2192 A, learned using reinforcement learning, for several classical control problems from OpenAI Gym [12]. Here, S \u2286 Rd is the state space and A is the action space, which can be discrete or continuous. To obtain a distribution P over S, we sample n = 100 states from the distribution over S induced by executing the learned policy \u03c0\u2217, and then split it into training and test sets as before. We then fit a Gaussian mixture model to the training set with K = 10 components. Finally, we extract a decision tree approximating \u03c0\u2217 according to P using n = 2000 samples to estimate (1) and (3). The cartpole and mountain car control policies are learned using Q-learning [41]. For the cartpole (discrete actions) [2, 10], the learner uses a discretized state space (7 bins per dimension) [1], and for the mountain car (discrete actions) [4, 33], it approximates the Q-function with a linear model over RBF features [3]. For the pendulum (continuous actions) [5], the learner represents the policy using a 3-layer neural net, which it trains using the cross-entropy method [6].\nBaseline. Our baseline is to use CART to train a decision tree approximating f on the training set {(x, f(x)) | x \u2208 Xtrain}. As before, we use scikit-learn to train these trees, using Gini impurity for classification and MSE for regression. Additionally, we bound the size of the tree to k = 31 nodes.\nResults. We show results in Table 1. We show the test set performance of the extracted tree compared to ground truth (or for MDPs, estimated the reward when it is used as a policy), as well as the relative performance compared to the model f on the same test set. Note that our goal is to obtain high relative performance, since a better approximation of f is a better interpretation of f , even if f has poor performance. Our algorithm outperforms the baseline on every problem instance.\nAvoiding overfitting. Our algorithm outperforms the baseline by using active learning to avoid overfitting, especially for high dimensional input spaces with few samples. Even on the relatively large breast cancer dataset, the baseline tree Tbase obtains an F1 score of 0.999 on the training set, whereas the extracted tree T obtains only 0.961, i.e., Tbase has overfit. This discrepancy holds across datasets, and is more pronounced for smaller datasets\u2014on the prostate cancer dataset, Tbase obtains an F1 score of 0.981 on the training set, whereas T obtains only 0.860.\nPerformance vs. size. In Figure 1, we show performance as a function of the number of nodes k on three problem instances. Our algorithm outperforms the baseline even as the tree sizes vary, achieving larger gains for larger k. By using active learning, we can learn arbitrarily large decision trees, whereas the baseline would perfectly fit the data if k becomes sufficiently large.\nConsistency of top branch. We examine the consistency of the top branch of the decision trees extracted using our algorithm across the 10 random splits of the datasets, focusing on the case where f is a random forest. In particular, we count the number of features r that occur in the top branch across the splits. We have r \u2264 2 except for the breast cancer dataset (r = 3) and the prostate cancer dataset (m = 4), showing that the top feature remains fairly consistent. For the prostate cancer dataset, r is relatively high since the number of samples is small so the models f vary more."}, {"heading": "5.2 Examples of Use Cases", "text": "Next, we show how the extracted decision trees can be used to interpret and debug models.\nUse of invalid features. Using an invalid feature is a common problem when training models. In particular, some datasets contain multiple response variables; then, one response should not be used as a feature when predicting another. For example, the breast cancer dataset contains two response variables indicating cancer recurrence\u2014the length of time before recurrence and whether recurrence occurs within 24 months. This issue can be thought of as a special case of using a non-causal feature, an important problem in healthcare settings. We train a random forest f to predict whether recurrence occurs within 24 months, where time to recurrence is incorrectly included as a feature. Then, we extract a decision tree approximating f of size k = 7 nodes, using 10 random dataset splits. The invalid feature occured in every extracted tree, and as the top branch in 6 of the 10 trees.\nUse of prejudiced features. We can use our algorithm to evaluate how a model f depends on prejudiced features. For example, gender is a feature in the student grade dataset, and may be considered sensitive when estimating student performance. However, if we simply omit gender, then f may reconstruct it from the remaining features. For a model f trained with gender available, we show how a decision tree extracted from f can be used to understand how f depends on gender. Our approach does not guarantee fairness, but it can be useful for evaluating the fairness of f .\nWe extract decision trees T from the random forests f trained on 10 random splits of the student grades dataset. The top features are consistently grades in other classes or number of failing grades received in the past. Gender occurs below these features (at the fourth or fifth level) in 7 of 10 of the trees. We can estimate the overall effect of changing the gender label:\n\u2206 = Ex\u223cP [f(x) | gender = M]\u2212 Ex\u223cP [f(x) | gender = F].\nWhen gender occurs, \u2206 is between 0.31 and 0.70 grade points (average 0.49) out of 20 total grade points. For the remaining models, \u2206 is between 0.11 and 0.32 (average 0.25). Therefore, the extracted tree includes gender when the model has a relatively large dependence on gender.\nMore interestingly, because T approximates f , we can use it to identify a subgroup of students where f has particularly strong dependence on gender. Letting N = (NL, NR, C) be the internal node branching on gender, F(CN ) are a subset of inputs whose label f(x) \u2208 Y is determined in part by gender in T . Also, we can use T to measure the dependence on gender within this subset:\n\u2206N = Ex\u223cP [f(x) | CNL ]\u2212 Ex\u223cP [f(x) | CNR ].\nFurthermore, we can estimate the fraction of students in this subset using the test set Xtest, i.e., P = \u2211 x\u2208Xtest I[x \u2208 F(CN )]. Finally, P \u00b7\u2206N/\u2206 measures the fraction of the overall dependence of f on gender that is accounted for by the subtree rooted at N . For models where gender occurs in the extracted tree, the subgroup effect size \u2206N ranged from 0.44 to 0.77 grade points, and the estimated fraction of students in this subroup ranged from 18.3% to 39.1%. The two trees that had the largest effect size had \u2206N of 0.77 and 0.43, respectively, and P of 39.1% and 35.7%, respectively; the identified subgroup accounted for 67.3% and 65.6% of the total effect of gender, respectively.\nHaving identified a subgroup of students likely to be adversely affected, the user might be able to train a better model specifically for this subgroup. In 5 of the 7 extracted trees where gender occurs, the affected students were students with low grades, in particular, the 27% of students who scored fewer than 8.5 points in another class. This fine-grained understanding of f relies on the extracted model, and cannot be obtained using feature importance metrics alone.\nComparing models. We can use the extracted decision trees to compare different models trained on the same dataset, and gain insight into why some models perform better than others. For example, random forests trained on the wine origin dataset performed very well, all achieving an F1 score of at least 0.961. In contrast, the performance of the neural nets was bimodal\u20145 had F1 score of at least 0.955, and the remaining had an F1 score of at most 0.741.\nWe examined the top 3 layers of the extracted decision trees T , and made two observations. First, occurrence of the feature \u201cchlorides\u201d in T was almost perfectly correlated with poor performance of the neural nets. This feature occured in only one of the 10 trees extracted from random forests, and in none of the trees extracted from high performing neural nets. A weaker observation was the branching of T on the feature \u201calcohol\u201d, which is a very important feature\u2014it is the top branch for all but one of the 20 extracted decision trees. For the high performing models, the branch threshold t tended to be higher (749.8 to 999.6) than those for the poorly performing models (574.4 to 837.3). The latter observation relies on having an extracted model\u2014feature influence metrics alone are insufficient.\nUnderstanding control policies. We can use the extracted decision tree to understand a learned control policy. For example, we describe a decision tree of size k = 7 extracted from the cartpole control policy. While its estimated reward of 152.3 is lower than for larger trees, it captures a significant fraction of the policy behavior. The tree says to move the cart to the right exactly when\n(pole velocity \u2265 \u22120.286) \u2227 (pole angle \u2265 \u22120.071),\nwhere the pole velocity is in [\u22122.0, 2.0] and the pole angle is in [\u22120.5, 0.5]. In other words, move the cart to the right exactly when the pole is already on the right relative to the cart, and the pole is also moving toward the left (or more precisely, not moving fast enough toward the right). This policy is asymmetric, focusing on states where the cart is moving to the left. Examining an animation of simulation, this bias occurs because the cart initially moves toward the left, so the portion of the state space where the cart is moving toward the right is relatively unexplored."}, {"heading": "6 Conclusions", "text": "We have proposed an approach for interpreting blackbox models based on decision tree extraction, and shown how it can be used to interpret random forests, neural nets, and control policies.

become an important issue as machine learning is increasingly used to inform consequential decisions. We propose an approach for interpreting a blackbox model by extracting a decision tree that approximates the model. Our model extraction algorithm avoids overfitting by leveraging blackbox model access to actively sample new training points. We prove that as the number of samples goes to infinity, the decision tree learned using our algorithm converges to the exact greedy decision tree. In our evaluation, we use our algorithm to interpret random forests and neural nets trained on several datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, as well as control policies learned for three classical reinforcement learning problems. We show that our algorithm improves over a baseline based on CART on every problem instance. Furthermore, we show how an interpretation generated by our approach can be used to understand and debug these models.", "creator": "LaTeX with hyperref package"}}}
