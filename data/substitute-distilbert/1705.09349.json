There is a sign that says that one of the two roads leads to prosperity, another to death. The agent must take the fork, but she does not know which road leads where. Does the agent have a strategy to get to prosperity? On one hand, since one of the roads leads to prosperity, such a strategy clearly exists. We denote this fact by modal formula Sap, where statement p is a claim of future prosperity. Furthermore, agent a knows that such a strategy exists. We write this as KaSap. Yet, the agent does not know what the strategy is and, thus, does not know how to use the strategy. We denote this by \u00acHap, where know-how modality Ha expresses the fact that agent a knows how to achieve the goal based on the information available to her. In this article we study the interplay between modality K, representing knowledge, modality S, representing the existence of a strategy, and modality H, representing the existence of a know-how strategy. Our main result is a complete trimodal axiomatic system capturing properties of this interplay."}, {"heading": "1.1 Epistemic Transition Systems", "text": "In this article we use epistemic transition systems to capture knowledge and strategic behavior. Informally, epistemic transition system is a directed labeled graph supplemented by an indistinguishability relation on vertices. For instance, our motivational example above can be captured by epistemic transition system T1 depicted in Figure 1. In this system state w represents the prosperity and\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n09 34\n9v 2\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 5\nJu n\nstate w\u2032 represents death. The original state is u, but it is indistinguishable by the agent a from state v. Arrows on the diagram represent possible transitions between the states. Labels on the arrows represent the choices that the agents make during the transition. For example, if in state u agent chooses left (L) road, she will transition to the prosperity state w and if she chooses right (R) road, she will transition to the death state w\u2032. In another epistemic state v, these roads lead the other way around. States u and v are not distinguishable by agent a, which is shown by the dashed line between these two states. In state u as well as state v the agent has a strategy to transition to the state of prosperity: u Sap and v Sap. In the case of state u this strategy is L, in the case of state v the strategy is R. Since the agent cannot distinguish states u and v, in both of these states she does not have a know-how strategy to reach prosperity: u 1 Hap and v 1 Hap. At the same time, since formula Sap is satisfied in all states indistinguishable to agent a from state u, we can claim that u KaSap and, similarly, v KaSap.\nAs our second example, let us consider the epistemic transition system T2 obtained from T1 by swapping labels on transitions from v to w and from v to w\u2032, see Figure 2. Although in system T2 agent a still cannot distinguish states u and v, she has a know-how strategy from either of these states to reach state w. We write this as u Hap and v Hap. The strategy is to choose L. This strategy is know-how because it does not require to make different choices in the states that the agent cannot distinguish."}, {"heading": "1.2 Imperfect Recall", "text": "For the next example, we consider a transition system T3 obtained from system T1 by adding a new epistemic state s. From state s, agent a can choose label L to reach state u or choose label R to reach state v. Since proposition q is satisfied in state u, agent a has a know-how strategy to transition from state s to a state (namely, state u) where q is satisfied. Therefore, s Haq.\nA more interesting question is whether s HaHap is true. In other words, does agent a know how to transition from state s to a state in which she knows how to transition to another state in which p is satisfied? One might think that such a strategy indeed exists: in state s agent a chooses label L to transition to state u. Since there is no transition labeled by L that leads from state s to state v, upon ending the first transition the agent would know that she is in state u, where she needs to choose label L to transition to state w. This argument, however, is based on the assumption that agent a has a perfect recall. Namely, agent a in state u remembers the choice that she made in the previous state. We assume that the agents do not have a perfect recall and that an epistemic state description captures whatever memories the agent has in this state. In other words, in this article we assume that the only knowledge that an agent possesses is the knowledge captured by the indistinguishability relation on the epistemic states. Given this assumption, upon reaching the state u (indistinguishable from state v) agent a knows that there exists a choice that she can make to transition to state in which p is satisfied: s HaSap. However, she does not know which choice (L or R) it is: s 1 HaHap.\n1.3 Multiagent Setting\nSo far, we have assumed that only agent a has an influence on which transi-\ntion the system takes. In transition system T4 depicted in Figure 4, we introduce another agent b and assume both agents a and b have influence on the transitions. In each state, the system takes the transition labeled D by default unless there is a consensus of agents a and b to take the transition labeled C. In such a setting, each agent has a strategy to transition system from state u into state w by voting D, but neither of them alone has a strategy to transition from state u to state w\u2032 because such a transition requires the consensus of both agents. Thus, u Sap\u2227Sbp\u2227\u00acSaq\u2227\u00acSbq. Additionally, both agents know how to transition the system from state u into state w, they just need to vote D. Therefore, u Hap \u2227 Hbp.\nIn Figure 5, we show a more complicated transition system obtained from T1 by renaming label L to D and renaming label R to C. Same as in transition system T4, we assume that there are two agents a and b voting on the system transition. We also assume that agent a cannot distinguish states u and v while agent b can. By default, the system takes the transition labeled D unless there is a consensus to take transition labeled C. As a result, agent a has a strategy (namely, vote D) in state u to transition system to state w, but because agent a cannot distinguish state u from state v, not only does she not know how to do this, but she is not aware that such a strategy exists: u Sap\u2227\u00acHap\u2227\u00acKaSap. Agent b, however, not only has a strategy to transition the system from state u to state w, but also knows how to achieve this: u Hbp."}, {"heading": "1.4 Coalitions", "text": "We have talked about strategies, know-hows, and knowledge of individual agents. In this article we consider knowledge, strategies, and know-how strategies of coalitions. There are several forms of group knowledge that have been studied before. The two most popular of them are common knowledge and distributed knowledge [8]. Different contexts call for different forms of group knowledge.\nAs illustrated in the famous Two Generals\u2019 Problem [4, 11] where communication channels between the agents are unreliable, establishing a common knowledge between agents might be essential for having a strategy.\nIn some settings, the distinction between common and distributed knowledge is insignificant. For example, if members of a political fraction get to-\ngether to share all their information and to develop a common strategy, then the distributed knowledge of the members becomes the common knowledge of the fraction during the in-person meeting.\nFinally, in some other situations the distributed knowledge makes more sense than the common knowledge. For example, if a panel of experts is formed to develop a strategy, then this panel achieves the best result if it relies on the combined knowledge of its members rather than on their common knowledge.\nIn this article we focus on distributed coalition knowledge and distributedknow-how strategies. We leave the common knowledge for the future research.\nTo illustrate how distributed knowledge of coalitions interacts with strategies and know-hows, consider epistemic transition system T6 depicted in Figure 6. In this system, agents a and b cannot distinguish states u and v while agents b and c cannot distinguish states v and u\u2032. In every state, each of agents a, b and c votes either L or R, and the system transitions according to the majority vote. In such a setting, any coalition of two agents can fully control the transitions of the system.\nFor example, by both voting L, agents a and b form a coalition {a, b} that forces the system to transition from state u to state w no matter how agent c votes. Since proposition p is satisfied in state w, we write u S{a,b}p, or simply u Sa,bp. Similarly, coalition {a, b} can vote R to force the system to transition from state v to state w. Therefore, coalition {a, b} has strategies to achieve p in states u and v, but the strategies are different. Since they cannot distinguish states u and v, agents a and b know that they have a strategy to achieve p, but they do not know how to achieve p. In our notations, v Sa,bp \u2227 Ka,bSa,bp \u2227 \u00acHa,bp.\nOn the other hand, although agents b and c cannot distinguish states v and u\u2032, by both voting R in either of states v and u\u2032, they form a coalition {b, c} that forces the system to transition to state w where p is satisfied. Therefore, in any of states v and u\u2032, they not only have a strategy to achieve p, but also know that they have such a strategy, and more importantly, they know how to achieve p, that is, v Hb,cp."}, {"heading": "1.5 Nondeterministic Transitions", "text": "In all the examples that we have discussed so far, given any state in a system, agents\u2019 votes uniquely determine the transition of the system. Our framework also allows nondeterministic transitions. Consider transition system T7 depicted in Figure 7. In this system, there are two agents a and b who can vote either C or D. If both agents vote C, then the system takes one of the consensus transitions labeled with C. Otherwise, the system takes the transition labeled with D. Note that there are two consensus transitions starting from state u. Therefore, even if both agents vote C, they do not have a strategy to achieve p, i.e., u 1 Sa,bp. However, they can achieve p \u2228 q. Moreover, since all agents can distinguish all states, we have u Ha,b(p \u2228 q)."}, {"heading": "1.6 Universal Principles", "text": "In the examples above we focused on specific properties that were either satisfied or not satisfied in particular states of epistemic transition systems T1 through T7. In this article, we study properties that are satisfied in all states of all epistemic transition systems. Our main result is a sound and complete axiomatization of all such properties. We finish the introduction with an informal discussion of these properties.\nProperties of Single Modalities Knowledge modality KC satisfies the axioms of epistemic logic S5 with distributed knowledge. Both strategic modality SC and know-how modality HC satisfy cooperation properties [17, 18]:\nSC(\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8)\u2192 (SD\u03d5\u2192 SC\u222aD\u03c8), where C \u2229D = \u2205, (1) HC(\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8)\u2192 (HD\u03d5\u2192 HC\u222aD\u03c8), where C \u2229D = \u2205. (2)\nThey also satisfy monotonicity properties\nSC\u03d5\u2192 SD\u03d5, where C \u2286 D, HC\u03d5\u2192 HD\u03d5, where C \u2286 D.\nThe two monotonicity properties are not among the axioms of our logical system because, as we show in Lemma 5 and Lemma 3, they are derivable.\nProperties of Interplay Note that w HC\u03d5 means that coalition C has the same strategy to achieve \u03d5 in all epistemic states indistinguishable by the coalition from state w. Hence, the following principle is universally true:\nHC\u03d5\u2192 KCHC\u03d5. (3)\nSimilarly, w \u00acHC\u03d5 means that coalition C does not have the same strategy to achieve \u03d5 in all epistemic states indistinguishable by the coalition from state w. Thus,\n\u00acHC\u03d5\u2192 KC\u00acHC\u03d5. (4)\nWe call properties (3) and (4) strategic positive introspection and strategic negative introspection, respectively. The strategic negative introspection is one of our axioms. Just as how the positive introspection principle follows from the rest of the axioms in S5 (see Lemma 14), the strategic positive introspection principle is also derivable (see Lemma 1).\nWhenever a coalition knows how to achieve something, there should exist a strategy for the coalition to achieve. In our notation,\nHC\u03d5\u2192 SC\u03d5. (5)\nWe call this formula strategic truth property and it is one of the axioms of our logical system.\nThe last two axioms of our logical system deal with empty coalitions. First of all, if formula K\u2205\u03d5 is satisfied in an epistemic state of our transition system, then formula \u03d5 must be satisfied in every state of this system. Thus, even empty coalition has a trivial strategy to achieve \u03d5:\nK\u2205\u03d5\u2192 H\u2205\u03d5. (6)\nWe call this property empty coalition principle. In this article we assume that an epistemic transition system never halts. That is, in every state of the system no matter what the outcome of the vote is, there is always a next state for this vote. This restriction on the transition systems yields property\n\u00acSC\u22a5. (7)\nthat we call nontermination principle. Let us now turn to the most interesting and perhaps most unexpected property of interplay. Note that S\u2205\u03d5 means that an empty coalition has a strategy to achieve \u03d5. Since the empty coalition has no members, nobody has to vote in a particular way. Statement \u03d5 is guaranteed to happen anyway. Thus, statement S\u2205\u03d5 simply means that statement \u03d5 is unavoidably satisfied after any single transition.\nFor example, consider an epistemic transition system depicted in Figure 8. As in some of our earlier examples, this system has agents a and b who vote either C or D. If both agents vote C, then the system takes one of the consensus transitions labeled with C. Otherwise, the system takes the default transition\nlabeled with D. Note that in state v it is guaranteed that statement p will happen after a single transition. Thus, v S\u2205p. At the same time, neither agent a nor agent b knows about this because they cannot distinguish state v from states u and u\u2032 respectively. Thus, v \u00acKaS\u2205p \u2227 \u00acKbS\u2205p.\nIn the same transition system T8, agents a and b together can distinguish state v from states u and u\u2032. Thus, v Ka,bS\u2205p. In general, statement KCS\u2205\u03d5 means that not only \u03d5 is unavoidable, but coalition C knows about it. Thus, coalition C has a know-how strategy to achieve \u03d5:\nKCS\u2205\u03d5\u2192 HC\u03d5.\nIn fact, the coalition would achieve the result no matter which strategy it uses. Coalition C can even use a strategy that simultaneously achieves another result in addition to \u03d5:\nKCS\u2205\u03d5 \u2227 HC\u03c8 \u2192 HC(\u03d5 \u2227 \u03c8).\nIn our logical system we use an equivalent form of the above principle that is stated using only implication:\nHC(\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8)\u2192 (KCS\u2205\u03d5\u2192 HC\u03c8). (8)\nWe call this property epistemic determinicity principle. Properties (1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8), together with axioms of epistemic logic S5 with distributed knowledge and propositional tautologies constitute the axioms of our sound and complete logical system."}, {"heading": "1.7 Literature Review", "text": "Logics of coalition power were developed by Marc Pauly [17, 18], who also proved the completeness of the basic logic of coalition power. Pauly\u2019s approach has been widely studied in the literature [10, 23, 7, 20, 2, 3, 6]. An alternative logical system was proposed by More and Naumov [14].\nAlur, Henzinger, and Kupferman introduced Alternating-Time Temporal Logic (ATL) that combines temporal and coalition modalities [5]. Van der Hoek and Wooldridge proposed to combine ATL with epistemic modality to form Alternating-Time Temporal Epistemic Logic [22]. They did not prove the completeness theorem for the proposed logical system.\nA\u030agotnes and Alechina proposed a complete logical system that combines the coalition power and epistemic modalities [1]. Since this system does not have\nepistemic requirements on strategies, it does not contain any axioms describing the interplay of these modalities.\nKnow-how strategies were studied before under different names. While Jamroga and A\u030agotnes talked about \u201cknowledge to identify and execute a strategy\u201d [12], Jamroga and van der Hoek discussed \u201cdifference between an agent knowing that he has a suitable strategy and knowing the strategy itself\u201d [13]. Van Benthem called such strategies \u201cuniform\u201d [21]. Wang gave a complete axiomatization of \u201cknowing how\u201d as a binary modality [25, 24], but his logical system does not include the knowledge modality.\nIn our AAMAS paper, we investigated coalition strategies to enforce a condition indefinitely [15]. Such strategies are similar to \u201cgoal maintenance\u201d strategies in Pauly\u2019s \u201cextended coalition logic\u201d [17, p. 80]. We focused on \u201cexecutable\u201d and \u201cverifiable\u201d strategies. Using the language of the current article, executability means that a coalition remains \u201cin the know-how\u201d throughout the execution of the strategy. Verifiability means that the coalition can verify that the enforced condition remains true. In the notations of the current article, the existence of a verifiable strategy could be expressed as SCKC\u03d5. In [15], we provided a complete logical system that describes the interplay between the modality representing the existence of an \u201cexecutable\u201d and \u201cverifiable\u201d coalition strategy to enforce and the modality representing knowledge. This system can prove principles similar to the strategic positive introspection (3) and the strategic negative introspection (4) mentioned above. A similar complete logical system in a single-agent setting for strategies to achieve a goal in multiple steps rather than to maintain a goal is developed by Fervari, Herzig, Li, and Wang [9].\nIn the current article, we combine know-how modality H with strategic modality S and epistemic modality K. The proof of the completeness theorem is significantly more challenging than in [15, 9]. It employs new techniques that construct pairs of maximal consistent sets in \u201charmony\u201d and in \u201ccomplete harmony\u201d. See Section 6.3 and Section 6.4 for details. An extended abstract of this article, without proofs, appeared as [16]."}, {"heading": "1.8 Outline", "text": "This article is organized as follows.

We discuss the intuition behind this construction and introduce the notion of harmony in Section 6.3. The notion of complete harmony is introduced in Section 6.4."}, {"heading": "2 Syntax and Semantics", "text": "In this section we present the formal syntax and semantics of our logical system given a fixed finite set of agentsA. Epistemic transition system could be thought of as a Kripke model of modal logic S5 with distributed knowledge to which we add transitions controlled by a vote aggregation mechanism. Examples of vote aggregation mechanisms that we have considered in the introduction are the consensus/default mechanism and the majority vote mechanism. Unlike the introductory examples, in the general definition below we assume that at different states the mechanism might use different rules for vote aggregation. The only restriction on the mechanism that we introduce is that there should be at least one possible transition that the system can take no matter what the votes are. In other words, we assume that the system can never halt.\nFor any set of votes V , by V A we mean the set of all functions from set A to set V . Alternatively, the set V A could be thought of as a set of tuples of elements of V indexed by elements of A.\nDefinition 1 A tuple (W, {\u223ca}a\u2208A, V,M, \u03c0) is called an epistemic transition system, where\n1. W is a set of epistemic states,\n2. \u223ca is an indistinguishability equivalence relation on W for each a \u2208 A,\n3. V is a nonempty set called \u201cdomain of choices\u201d,\n4. M \u2286 W \u00d7 V A \u00d7W is an aggregation mechanism where for each w \u2208 W and each s \u2208 V A, there is w\u2032 \u2208W such that (w, s, w\u2032) \u2208M ,\n5. \u03c0 is a function that maps propositional variables into subsets of W .\nDefinition 2 A coalition is a subset of A.\nNote that a coalition is always finite due to our assumption that the set of all agents A is finite. Informally, we say that two epistemic states are indistinguishable by a coalition C if they are indistinguishable by every member of the coalition. Formally, coalition indistinguishability is defined as follows:\nDefinition 3 For any epistemic states w1, w2 \u2208 W and any coalition C, let w1 \u223cC w2 if w1 \u223ca w2 for each agent a \u2208 C.\nCorollary 1 Relation \u223cC is an equivalence relation on the set of states W for each coalition C.\nBy a strategy profile {sa}a\u2208C of a coalition C we mean a tuple that specifies vote sa \u2208 V of each member a \u2208 C. Since such a tuple can also be viewed as a function from set C to set V , we denote the set of all strategy profiles of a coalition C by V C :\nDefinition 4 Any tuple {sa}a\u2208C \u2208 V C is called a strategy profile of coalition C.\nIn addition to a fixed finite set of agents A we also assume a fixed countable set of propositional variables. We use the assumption that this set is countable in the proof of Lemma 21. The language \u03a6 of our formal logical system is specified in the next definition.\nDefinition 5 Let \u03a6 be the minimal set of formulae such that\n1. p \u2208 \u03a6 for each propositional variable p,\n2. \u00ac\u03d5,\u03d5\u2192 \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6 for all formulae \u03d5,\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6,\n3. KC\u03d5,SC\u03d5,HC\u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6 for each coalition C and each \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6.\nIn other words, language \u03a6 is defined by the following grammar:\n\u03d5 := p | \u00ac\u03d5 | \u03d5\u2192 \u03d5 | KC\u03d5 | SC\u03d5 | HC\u03d5.\nBy \u22a5 we denote the negation of a tautology. For example, we can assume that \u22a5 is \u00ac(p\u2192 p) for some fixed propositional variable p.\nAccording to Definition 1, a mechanism specifies the transition that a system might take for any strategy profile of the set of all agents A. It is sometimes convenient to consider transitions that are consistent with a given strategy profile s of a give coalition C \u2286 A. We write w \u2192s u if a transition from state w to state u is consistent with strategy profile s. The formal definition is below.\nDefinition 6 For any epistemic states w, u \u2208 W , any coalition C, and any strategy profile s = {sa}a\u2208C \u2208 V C , we write w \u2192s u if (w, s\u2032, u) \u2208 M for some strategy profile s\u2032 = {s\u2032a}a\u2208A \u2208 V A such that s\u2032a = sa for each a \u2208 C.\nCorollary 2 For any strategy profile s of the empty coalition \u2205, if there are a coalition C and a strategy profile s\u2032 of coalition C such that w \u2192s\u2032 u, then w \u2192s u.\nThe next definition is the key definition of this article. It formally specifies the meaning of the three modalities in our logical system.\nDefinition 7 For any epistemic state w \u2208 W of a transition system (W, {\u223ca }a\u2208A, V,M, \u03c0) and any formula \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6, let relation w \u03d5 be defined as follows\n1. w p if w \u2208 \u03c0(p) where p is a propositional variable,\n2. w \u00ac\u03d5 if w 1 \u03d5,\n3. w \u03d5\u2192 \u03c8 if w 1 \u03d5 or w \u03c8,\n4. w KC\u03d5 if w\u2032 \u03d5 for each w\u2032 \u2208W such that w \u223cC w\u2032,\n5. w SC\u03d5 if there is a strategy profile s \u2208 V C such that w \u2192s w\u2032 implies w\u2032 \u03d5 for every w\u2032 \u2208W ,\n6. w HC\u03d5 if there is a strategy profile s \u2208 V C such that w \u223cC w\u2032 and w\u2032 \u2192s w\u2032\u2032 imply w\u2032\u2032 \u03d5 for all w\u2032, w\u2032\u2032 \u2208W ."}, {"heading": "3 Axioms", "text": "In additional to propositional tautologies in language \u03a6, our logical system consists of the following axioms.\n1.

Child w\u2032\u2032 is a state such that \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 w\u2032\u2032 and coalition C cannot prevent the system to transition from w\u2032 to w\u2032\u2032.\nOne might think that states w\u2032 and w\u2032\u2032 could be constructed in order: first state w\u2032 and then state w\u2032\u2032. It appears, however, that such an approach does not work because it does not guarantee that \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 w\u2032\u2032. To solve the issue, we construct states w\u2032 and w\u2032\u2032 simultaneously. While constructing states w\u2032 and w\u2032\u2032 as maximal consistent sets of formulae, it is important to maintain two relations between sets w\u2032 and w\u2032\u2032 that we call \u201cto be in harmony\u201d and \u201cto be in complete harmony\u201d. In this section we define harmony relation and prove its basic properties. The next section is dedicated to the complete harmony relation.\nEven though according to Definition 5 the language of our logical system only includes propositional connectives \u00ac and \u2192, other connectives, including conjunction \u2227, can be defined in the standard way. By \u2227Y we mean the conjunction of a finite set of formulae Y . If set Y is a singleton, then \u2227Y represents the single element of set Y . If set Y is empty, then \u2227Y is defined to be any propositional tautology.\nDefinition 8 Pair (X,Y ) of sets of formulae is in harmony if X 0 S\u2205\u00ac \u2227 Y \u2032 for each finite set Y \u2032 \u2286 Y .\nLemma 17 If pair (X,Y ) is in harmony, then set X is consistent.\nProof. If set X is not consistent, then any formula can be derived from it. In particular, X ` S\u2205\u00ac \u2227 \u2205. Therefore, pair (X,Y ) is not in harmony by Definition 8.\nLemma 18 If pair (X,Y ) is in harmony, then set Y is consistent.\nProof. Suppose that Y is inconsistent. Then, there is a finite set Y \u2032 \u2286 Y such that ` \u00ac\u2227Y \u2032. Hence, ` S\u2205\u00ac\u2227Y \u2032 by Lemma 4. Thus, X ` S\u2205\u00ac\u2227Y \u2032. Therefore,\nby Definition 8, pair (X,Y ) is not in harmony.\nLemma 19 For any \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6, if pair (X,Y ) is in harmony, then either pair (X \u222a {\u00acS\u2205\u03d5}, Y ) or pair (X,Y \u222a {\u03d5}) is in harmony.\nProof. Suppose that neither pair (X \u222a {\u00acS\u2205\u03d5}, Y ) nor pair (X,Y \u222a {\u03d5}) is in harmony. Then, by Definition 8, there are finite sets Y1 \u2286 Y and Y2 \u2286 Y \u222a {\u03d5} such that\nX,\u00acS\u2205\u03d5 ` S\u2205\u00ac \u2227 Y1 (11)\nand X ` S\u2205\u00ac \u2227 Y2.

Thus, ` S\u2205(\u00ac \u2227 Y1 \u2192 \u00ac((\u2227Y1) \u2227 (\u2227(Y2 \\ {\u03d5})))) by Lemma 4. Then, by Cooperation axiom, statement (11), and Modus Ponens inference rule, X,\u00acS\u2205\u03d5 ` S\u2205\u222a\u2205\u00ac((\u2227Y1) \u2227 (\u2227(Y2 \\ {\u03d5}))).

Thus, by Lemma 4,\n` S\u2205(\u00ac \u2227 Y2 \u2192 (\u03d5\u2192 \u00ac((\u2227Y1) \u2227 (\u2227(Y2 \\ {\u03d5}))))).\nThen, by Cooperation axiom, statement (12), and Modus Ponens inference rule, X ` S\u2205(\u03d5\u2192 \u00ac((\u2227Y1)\u2227(\u2227(Y2\\{\u03d5})))). Thus, by Cooperation axiom and Modus Ponens inference rule,\nX ` S\u2205\u03d5\u2192 S\u2205\u00ac((\u2227Y1) \u2227 (\u2227(Y2 \\ {\u03d5}))).\nBy Modus Ponens inference rule,\nX,S\u2205\u03d5 ` S\u2205\u00ac((\u2227Y1) \u2227 (\u2227(Y2 \\ {\u03d5}))).\nHence, X ` S\u2205\u00ac((\u2227Y1)\u2227(\u2227(Y2\\{\u03d5}))) by statement (13) and the laws of propositional reasoning. Recall that Y1 and Y2 \\{\u03d5} are subsets of Y . Therefore, pair (X,Y ) is not in harmony by Definition 8.\nThe next lemma is an equivalent of Lemma 15 and Lemma 16 for modality HC .\nLemma 20 For any consistent set of formulae X, any formula \u00acHC\u03c8 \u2208 X, and any function f : C \u2192 \u03a6, pair (Y, Z) is in harmony, where\nY = {\u03d5 | KC\u03d5 \u2208 X}, and Z = {\u00ac\u03c8} \u222a {\u03c7 | \u2203D \u2286 C (HD\u03c7 \u2208 X \u2227 \u2200a \u2208 D (f(a) = \u03c7))}.\nProof.

Recall that the set of agent A is finite and the set of propositional variables is countable. Thus, the set of all formulae \u03a6 is also countable.

The statement follows from Lemma 22, Lemma 23, and Definition 11 because there is a unique path between any two nodes in a tree.\nAt the beginning of Section 6.2, we discussed that if a parent node contains a modal formula \u00ac2\u03c8, then it must have a child node containing formula \u00ac\u03c8.\nLemma 15 in Section 6.2 provides a foundation for constructing such a child node for modality KC .

Assumption KC\u03d5 /\u2208 hd(w) implies that \u00acKC\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w) due to the maximality of the set hd(w). Thus, by Lemma 15, set Y0 = {\u00ac\u03d5} \u222a {\u03c8 | KC\u03c8 \u2208 hd(w)} is consistent. Let Y be a maximal consistent extension of set Y0 and w\u2032 be sequence w,C, Y . In other words, sequence w\u2032 is an extension of sequence w by two additional elements: C and Y . Note that w\u2032 \u2208 W due to Definition 10 and the choice of set Y0. Furthermore, w \u223cC w\u2032 by Definition 11. To finish the proof, we need to show that \u03d5 /\u2208 hd(w\u2032). Indeed, \u00ac\u03d5 \u2208 Y0 \u2286 Y = hd(w\u2032) by the choice of Y0. Therefore, \u03d5 /\u2208 hd(w\u2032) due to the consistency of the set hd(w\u2032).\nIn the next two definitions we specify the domain of votes and the vote aggregation mechanism of the canonical transition system. Informally, a vote (\u03d5,w) of each agent consists of two components: the actual vote \u03d5 and a key w. The actual vote \u03d5 is a formula from \u03a6 in support of what the agent votes. Recall that the agent does not know in which exact state the system is, she only knows the equivalence class of this state with respect to the indistinguishability relation. The key w is the agent\u2019s guess of the epistemic state where the system is. Informally, agent\u2019s vote has more power to force the formula to be satisfied in the next state if she guesses the current state correctly.\nAlthough each agent is free to vote for any formula she likes, the vote aggregation mechanism would grant agent\u2019s wish only under certain circumstances. Namely, if the system is in state w and set hd(w) contains formula SC\u03d5, then the mechanism guarantees that formula \u03d5 is satisfied in the next state as long as each member of coalition C votes for formula \u03d5 and correctly guesses the current epistemic state. In other words, in order for formula \u03d5 to be guaranteed in the next state all members of the coalition C must cast vote (\u03d5,w). This means that if SC\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w), then coalition C has a strategy to force \u03d5 in the next state. Since the strategy requires each member of the coalition to guess correctly the current state, such a strategy is not a know-how strategy.\nThe vote aggregation mechanism is more forgiving if the epistemic state w contains formula HC\u03d5. In this case the mechanism guarantees that formula \u03d5 is satisfied in the next state if all members of the coalition vote for formula \u03d5; it does not matter if they guess the current state correctly or not. This means that if HC\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w), then coalition C has a know-how strategy to force \u03d5 in the next state. The strategy consists in each member of the coalition voting for formula \u03d5 and specifying an arbitrary epistemic state as the key.\nFormal definitions of the domain of choices and of the vote aggregation mechanism in the canonical epistemic transition system are given below.\nDefinition 12 The domain of choices V is \u03a6\u00d7W .\nFor any pair u = (x, y), let pr1(u) = x and pr2(u) = y.\nDefinition 13 The mechanism M of the canonical model is the set of all tuples (w, {sa}a\u2208A, w\u2032) such that for each formula \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6 and each coalition C,\n1. if SC\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w) and sa = (\u03d5,w) for each a \u2208 C, then \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032), and\n2. if HC\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w) and pr1(sa) = \u03d5 for each a \u2208 C, then \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032).\nThe next two lemmas prove that the vote aggregation mechanism specified in Definition 13 acts as discussed in the informal description given earlier.\nLemma 26 Let w,w\u2032 \u2208W be epistemic states, SC\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w) be a formula, and s = {sa}a\u2208C be a strategy profile of coalition C. If w \u2192s w\u2032 and sa = (\u03d5,w) for each a \u2208 C, then \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032).\nProof. Suppose that w \u2192s w\u2032. Thus, by Definition 6, there is a strategy profile s\u2032 = {s\u2032a}a\u2208A \u2208 V A such that s\u2032a = sa for each a \u2208 C and (w, s\u2032, w\u2032) \u2208 M . Therefore, \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032) by Definition 13 and the assumption sa = (\u03d5,w) for each a \u2208 C.\nLemma 27 Let w,w\u2032, w\u2032\u2032 \u2208W be epistemic states, HC\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w) be a formula, and s = {sa}a\u2208C be a strategy profile of coalition C. If w \u223cC w\u2032, w\u2032 \u2192s w\u2032\u2032, and pr1(sa) = \u03d5 for each a \u2208 C, then \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032\u2032).\nProof. Suppose that HC\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w). Thus, hd(w) ` KCHC\u03d5 by Lemma 1. Hence, KCHC\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w) due to the maximality of the set hd(w). Thus, HC\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032) by Lemma 24 and the assumption w \u223cC w\u2032. By Definition 6, assumption w\u2032 \u2192s w\u2032\u2032 implies that there is a strategy profile s\u2032 = {s\u2032a}a\u2208A such that s\u2032a = sa for each a \u2208 C and (w\u2032, s\u2032, w\u2032\u2032) \u2208 M . Since HC\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032), pr1(s\u2032a) = pr1(sa) = \u03d5 for each a \u2208 C, and (w\u2032, s\u2032, w\u2032\u2032) \u2208M , we have \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032\u2032) by Definition 13.\nThe lemma below provides a construction of a child node for modality SC . Although the proof follows the outline of the proof of Lemma 25 for modality KC , it is significantly more involved because of the need to show that a transition from a parent node to a child node satisfies the constraints of the vote aggregation mechanism from Definition 13.\nLemma 28 For any epistemic state w \u2208 W , any formula \u00acSC\u03c8 \u2208 hd(w), and any strategy profile s = {sa}a\u2208C \u2208 V C , there is a state w\u2032 \u2208 W such that w \u2192s w\u2032 and \u03c8 /\u2208 hd(w\u2032).\nProof. Let Y0 be the following set of formulae\n{\u00ac\u03c8} \u222a {\u03d5 | \u2203D \u2286 C(SD\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w) \u2227 \u2200a \u2208 D(pr1(sa) = \u03d5))}.\nWe first show that set Y0 is consistent. Suppose the opposite. Thus, there must exist formulae \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5n \u2208 Y0 and subsets D1, . . . , Dn \u2286 C such that (i) SDi\u03d5i \u2208 hd(w) for each integer i \u2264 n, (ii) pr1(sa) = \u03d5i for each i \u2264 n and each a \u2208 Di, and (iii) set {\u00ac\u03c8,\u03d51, . . . , \u03d5n} is inconsistent. Without loss of generality we can assume that formulae \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5n are pairwise distinct.\nClaim 2 Sets Di and Dj are disjoint for each i 6= j.\nProof of Claim. Assume that d \u2208 Di \u2229Dj , then pr1(sd) = \u03d5i and pr1(sd) = \u03d5j . Hence, \u03d5i = \u03d5j , which contradicts the assumption that formulae \u03d51, . . . , \u03d5n are pairwise distinct. Therefore, sets Di and Dj are disjoint for each i 6= j.\nBy Lemma 16, it follows from Claim 2 that set Y0 is consistent. Let Y be any maximal consistent extension of Y0 and w\n\u2032 be the sequence w,\u2205, Y . In other words, w\u2032 is an extension of sequence w by two additional elements: \u2205 and Y .\nClaim 3 w\u2032 \u2208W .\nProof of Claim. By Definition 10, it suffices to show that, for each formula \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6, if K\u2205\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w), then \u03d5 \u2208 Y . Indeed, suppose that K\u2205\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w). Thus, hd(w) ` H\u2205\u03d5 by Empty Coalition axiom. Hence, hd(w) ` S\u2205\u03d5 by Strategic Truth axiom. Then, S\u2205\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w) due to the maximality of set hd(w). Therefore, \u03d5 \u2208 Y0 \u2286 Y by the choice of sets Y0 and Y .\nLet > be any propositional tautology. For example, > could be formula \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8. Define strategy profile s\u2032 = {s\u2032a}a\u2208A as follows\ns\u2032a = { sa, if a \u2208 C, (>, w), otherwise.\n(18)\nClaim 4 For any formula \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6 and any D \u2286 A, if SD\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w) and s\u2032a = (\u03d5,w) for each a \u2208 D, then \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032).\nProof of Claim. Consider any formula \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6 and any set D \u2286 A such that SD\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w) and s\u2032a = (\u03d5,w) for each agent a \u2208 D. We need to show that \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032). Case 1: D \u2286 C. In this case, sa = s\u2032a = (\u03d5,w) for each a \u2208 D by definition (18). Thus, \u03d5 \u2208 Y0 \u2286 Y = hd(w\u2032) by the choice of set Y0. Case 2: There is a0 \u2208 D such that a0 /\u2208 C. Then, s\u2032a0 = (>, w) by definition (18). Note that s\u2032a0 = (\u03d5,w) by the choice of the set D. Thus, (>, w) = (\u03d5,w). Hence, formula \u03d5 is the tautology >. Therefore, \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032) because set hd(w\u2032) is maximal.\nClaim 5 For any formula \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6 and any D \u2286 A, if HD\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w) and pr1(s \u2032 a) = \u03d5 for each a \u2208 D, then \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032).\nProof of Claim. Consider any formula \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6 and any set D \u2286 A such that HD\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w) and pr1(s\u2032a) = \u03d5 for each agent a \u2208 D. We need to show that \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032). Case 1: D \u2286 C. In this case, pr1(sa) = pr1(s\u2032a) = \u03d5 for each agent a \u2208 D by definition (18) and the choice of set D. Thus, \u03d5 \u2208 Y0 \u2286 Y = hd(w\u2032) by the choice of set Y0. Case 2: There is agent a0 \u2208 D such that a0 /\u2208 C. Then, s\u2032a0 = (>, w) by definition (18). Note that pr1(s \u2032 a0) = \u03d5 by the choice of set D. Thus, > = \u03d5.\nHence, formula \u03d5 is the tautology >. Therefore, \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032) because set hd(w\u2032) is maximal.\nBy Definition 13, Claim 4 and Claim 5 together imply that (w, s\u2032, w\u2032) \u2208M . Hence, w \u2192s w\u2032 by Definition 6 and definition (18). To finish the proof of the lemma, note that \u03c8 /\u2208 hd(w\u2032) because set hd(w\u2032) is consistent and \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 Y0 \u2286 Y = hd(w\u2032).\nThe next lemma shows the construction of a child node for modality HC . The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 28 except that, instead of constructing a single child node, we construct two sibling nodes that are in complete harmony. The intuition was discussed at the beginning of Section 6.3.\nLemma 29 For any state w \u2208W , any formula \u00acHC\u03c8 \u2208 hd(w), and any strategy profile s = {sa}a\u2208C \u2208 V C , there are epistemic states w\u2032, w\u2032\u2032 \u2208 W such that \u03c8 /\u2208 hd(w\u2032\u2032), w \u223cC w\u2032, and w\u2032 \u2192s w\u2032\u2032.\nProof. By Definition 12, for each a \u2208 C, vote sa is a pair. Let\nY = {\u03d5 | KC\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w)}, and Z = {\u00ac\u03c8} \u222a {\u03d5 | \u2203D \u2286 C (HD\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w) \u2227 \u2200a \u2208 D (pr1(sa) = \u03d5))}.\nBy Lemma 20 where f(x) = pr1(sx), pair (Y,Z) is in harmony. By Lemma 21, there is a pair (Y \u2032, Z \u2032) in complete harmony such that Y \u2286 Y \u2032 and Z \u2286 Z \u2032. By Lemma 17 and Lemma 18, sets Y \u2032 and Z \u2032 are consistent. Let Y \u2032\u2032 and Z \u2032\u2032 be maximal consistent extensions of sets Y \u2032 and Z \u2032, respectively.\nRecall that set A is finite. Thus, set C \u2286 A is also finite. Let integer n be the cardinality of set C. Consider (n + 1) sequences w1, w2, . . . , wn+1, where sequence wk is an extension of sequence w that adds 2k additional elements:\nw1 = w,C, Y \u2032\u2032 w2 = w,C, Y \u2032\u2032, C, Y \u2032\u2032 w3 = w,C, Y \u2032\u2032, C, Y \u2032\u2032, C, Y \u2032\u2032\n. . . wn+1 = w,C, Y \u2032\u2032, . . . , C, Y \u2032\u2032\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n2(n+1) elements\n.\nClaim 6 wk \u2208W for each k \u2264 n+ 1.\nProof of Claim. We prove the claim by induction on integer k. Base Case: By Definition 10, it suffices to show that if KC\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w), then \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w1). Indeed, if KC\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w), then \u03d5 \u2208 Y by the choice of set Y . Therefore, \u03d5 \u2208 Y \u2286 Y \u2032 \u2286 Y \u2032\u2032 = hd(w1). Induction Step: By Definition 10, it suffices to show that if KC\u03d5 \u2208 hd(wk), then \u03d5 \u2208 hd(wk+1) for each k \u2265 1. In other words, we need to prove that if\nKC\u03d5 \u2208 Y \u2032\u2032, then \u03d5 \u2208 Y \u2032\u2032, which follows from Truth axiom and the maximality of set Y \u2032\u2032.\nBy the pigeonhole principle, there is i0 \u2264 n such that pr2(sa) 6= wi0 for all a \u2208 C. Let w\u2032 be epistemic state wi0 . Thus,\npr2(sa) 6= w\u2032 for each a \u2208 C. (19)\nLet w\u2032\u2032 be the sequence w,\u2205, Z \u2032\u2032. In other words, sequence w\u2032\u2032 is an extension of sequence w by two additional elements: \u2205 and Z \u2032\u2032. Finally, let strategy profile s\u2032 = {s\u2032a}a\u2208A be defined as follows\ns\u2032a = { sa, if a \u2208 C, (>, w\u2032), otherwise.\n(20)\nClaim 7 w\u2032\u2032 \u2208W .\nProof of Claim. By Definition 10, it suffices to show that if K\u2205\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w), then \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032\u2032) for each formula \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6. Indeed, by Empty Coalition axiom, assumption K\u2205\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w) implies that hd(w) ` H\u2205\u03d5. Hence, H\u2205\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w) by the maximality of the set hd(w). Thus, \u03d5 \u2208 Z by the choice of set Z. Therefore, \u03d5 \u2208 Z \u2286 Z \u2032 \u2286 Z \u2032\u2032 = hd(w\u2032\u2032).\nClaim 8 w \u223cC w\u2032.\nProof of Claim. By Definition 11, w \u223cC wi for each integer i \u2264 n + 1. In particular, w \u223cC wi0 = w\u2032.\nClaim 9 \u03c8 /\u2208 hd(w\u2032\u2032).\nProof of Claim. Note that \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 Z by the choice of set Z. Thus, \u00ac\u03c8 \u2208 Z \u2286 Z \u2032 \u2286 Z \u2032\u2032 = hd(w\u2032\u2032). Therefore, \u03c8 /\u2208 hd(w\u2032\u2032) due to the consistency of the set hd(w\u2032\u2032).\nClaim 10 Let \u03d5 be a formula in \u03a6 and D be a subset of A. If SD\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032) and s\u2032a = (\u03d5,w \u2032) for each a \u2208 D, then \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032\u2032).\nProof of Claim. Note that either set D is empty or it contains an element a0. In the latter case, element a0 either belongs or does not belong to set C. Case I: D = \u2205. Recall that pair (Y \u2032, Z \u2032) is in complete harmony. Thus, by Definition 9, either \u00acS\u2205\u03d5 \u2208 Y \u2032 \u2286 Y \u2032\u2032 = hd(w\u2032) or \u03d5 \u2208 Z \u2032 \u2286 Z \u2032\u2032 = hd(w\u2032\u2032). Assumption SD\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032) implies that \u00acS\u2205\u03d5 /\u2208 hd(w\u2032) due to the consistency of the set hd(w\u2032) and the assumption D = \u2205 of the case. Therefore, \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032\u2032). Case II: there is an element a0 \u2208 C \u2229D. Thus, a0 \u2208 C. Hence, pr2(sa0) 6= w\u2032 by inequality (19). Then, sa0 6= (\u03d5,w\u2032). Thus, s\u2032a0 6= (\u03d5,w\n\u2032) by definition (20). Recall that a0 \u2208 C \u2229D \u2286 D. This contradicts the assumption that s\u2032a = (\u03d5,w\u2032) for each a \u2208 D. Case III: there is an element a0 \u2208 D \\C. Thus, s\u2032a0 = (>, w\n\u2032) by definition (20). At the same time, s\u2032a0 = (\u03d5,w\n\u2032) by the second assumption of the claim. Hence, formula \u03d5 is the propositional tautology >. Therefore, \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032\u2032) due to the maximality of the set hd(w\u2032\u2032).\nClaim 11 Let \u03d5 be a formula in \u03a6 and D be a subset of A. If HD\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032) and pr1(s \u2032 a) = \u03d5 for each a \u2208 D, then \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032\u2032).\nProof of Claim. Case I: D \u2286 C. Suppose that pr1(s\u2032a) = \u03d5 for each a \u2208 D and HD\u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032). Thus, \u03d5 \u2208 Z by the choice of set Z. Therefore, \u03d5 \u2208 Z \u2286 Z \u2032 \u2286 Z \u2032\u2032 = hd(w\u2032\u2032). Case II: D * C. Consider any a0 \u2208 D \\ C. Note that s\u2032a0 = (>, w\n\u2032) by definition (20). At the same time, pr1(s \u2032 aa) = \u03d5 by the second assumption of the claim. Hence, formula \u03d5 is the propositional tautology >. Therefore, \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w\u2032\u2032) due to the maximality of the set hd(w\u2032\u2032).\nClaim 10 and Claim 11, by Definition 13, imply that (w\u2032, {s\u2032a}a\u2208A, w\u2032\u2032) \u2208M . Thus, w\u2032 \u2192s w\u2032\u2032 by Definition 6 and definition (20). This together with Claim 6, Claim 7, Claim 8, and Claim 9 completes the proof of the lemma.\nDefinition 14 \u03c0(p) = {w \u2208W | p \u2208 hd(w)}.\nThis concludes the definition of tuple (W, {\u223ca}a\u2208A, V,M, \u03c0).\nLemma 30 Tuple (W, {\u223ca}a\u2208A, V,M, \u03c0) is an epistemic transition system.\nProof. By Definition 1, it suffices to show that for each w \u2208W and each s \u2208 V A there is w\u2032 \u2208W such that (w, s, w\u2032) \u2208M .\nRecall that set A is finite. Thus, ` \u00acSA\u22a5 by Nontermination axiom. Hence, \u00acSA\u22a5 \u2208 hd(w). By Lemma 28, there is w\u2032 \u2208W such that w \u2192s w\u2032. Therefore, (w, s, w\u2032) \u2208M by Definition 6.\nLemma 31 w \u03d5 iff \u03d5 \u2208 hd(w) for each epistemic state w \u2208 W and each formula \u03d5 \u2208 \u03a6.\nProof. We prove the lemma by induction on the structural complexity of formula \u03d5. If formula \u03d5 is a propositional variable, then the required follows from Definition 7 and Definition 14. The cases of formula \u03d5 being a negation or an implication follow from Definition 7, and the maximality and the consistency of the set hd(w) in the standard way.\nLet formula \u03d5 have the form KC\u03c8. (\u21d2) Suppose that KC\u03c8 /\u2208 hd(w). Then, by Lemma 25, there is w\u2032 \u2208 W such that w \u223cC w\u2032 and \u03c8 /\u2208 hd(w\u2032). Hence, w\u2032 1 \u03c8 by the induction hypothesis. Therefore, w 1 KC\u03c8 by Definition 7. (\u21d0) Assume that KC\u03c8 \u2208 hd(w). Consider any w\u2032 \u2208W such that w \u223cC w\u2032. By Definition 7, it suffices to show that w\u2032 \u03c8. Indeed, \u03c8 \u2208 hd(w\u2032) by Lemma 24. Therefore, by the induction hypothesis, w\u2032 \u03c8.\nLet formula \u03d5 have the form SC\u03c8. (\u21d2) Suppose that SC\u03c8 /\u2208 hd(w).

Consider a strategy profile s = {sa}a\u2208C \u2208 V C such that sa = (\u03c8,w) for each a \u2208 C.
